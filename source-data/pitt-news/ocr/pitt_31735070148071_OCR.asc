UPMC doctor recalls Japan visit

John Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

When Dr. Atsunori Nakao arrived in
noitheastjapan four days after a mas-
sive earthquake and tsunami ravaged
parts of the island nation, he quickly
foundthat one unlikely medicine often
worked betterthanthe most advanced
pharmaceuticals. ‘
“Sometimes a piece of Hersheyfs
chocolate worked the best with pa-
tients,” said Nakao, a cardiothoracic
transplantation specialist at UPMC.
“We saw so many sad stories, and
sometimes it was the kindness that
mattered more than the medicine.”

Nakao traveled to his home nation

ofjapan as part of a medical disaster
team oiganizedbyajapanese nonproﬁt
in early March, distribuﬂng medicine
and treating injured people at a num-
ber of impromptu shelters across the

p country. He recountedhis experiences
yesterday at an information session

sponsored by the Graduate School for
Public and International Affairs.
About]5people attendedthe event,

including many of the GSPIA students '

studying international development
and disaster management. They lis-
tened to Nakao and others share ﬁrst-
hand stories aboutthe contlnuingetfort

to recover ﬁ'om thejapanese disaster _

and askedquestions aboutthebestways
to contribute to the relief efforts.

Notiall of the information Nakao ~

shared was new, but students in atten-
dancewere compelledbyhis anecdotes
and the extensive slide show. he pre-
sented. Duringhistalk, Nakao showed
several dozen pictures of damage’ and
relief effbrts.

“I can’t really tell you how bad the
situation was,” Nakao said. “It was as
bad as you’Ve probably heard.”

Duringhis tour of damaged areas,
Nakao said he sawtens of thousands of
people living in shelters without heat

, and electricity. '

“One of the main problems that is
still persistinginthe countiyisthe lack
of power,” Nakao said.

Thejapanesei government has re-

ported that the earthquake knocked
out about 25 percent of the nation’s
power plants, including the Fukush-
ima Daiichi nuclear complex, which
for weeks threatened to go into a full
meltdownbut now appearstobe under
control. That reductionin output has
put a strain on relief efforts and had a
ripple effect on the count1y’s economy,
wreaking havoc on the supply chain of
many goods. I . ‘
Pitt graduate student Aya Okada,
who made a presentation during the
event, also discussed the issues of
power. She shared pictures with the
audience that her mother, ajapanese

push for
Chevrolet

Tegan Hanlon
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl left his_of-‘~

ﬁce yesterday to drive a silver 2011
Chevrolet Volt electric car around
a three-mile loop starting at Heinz
Field.

Ravenstahl was not leisurely tour-
ing Downtown. Instead he was test-
ing Chevrolet’s newest model at Pitt’s
“ProsInMotion Ride and Drive,” one
of the ﬁnal marketing events put on
by ateam ofbusiness students as part
of its “Take Charge” campaign.

C Chevrolet gave students in profes-
sor Bob Gilbert’s Projects in Market-
ing Class — a class hand—selected
by Gilbert through applications ——
a $3,0o0'budget and the exclusive
opportunity to work with the Volt,
which will not be available to Penn-
sylvania consumers until August.
Pitt received the honor because of
students’ past success in marketing
contests.

Last semester the ProsInMotion
team competed against 23 universi-
ties and won ﬁrst place in Chevrolet’s
national competition to build the best
marketing campaign aimed at Gen-
erationY. p

Pitt senior Laura Watts, the
group’s agency coordinator, said
the classfaces a_ new challenge this
semester because it needs to ap-
peal to both students and the target
market — the older, higher income

generation that can afford the car a

with a starting price of a little over

$32,000.

Federal program aims to increase summer jobs for students

Philip Bombara
Staﬁ’ Writer

A new federal program aims to bring
100,000 summer jobs to college stu-
dents this year — but the initiative will
rely on the benevolence of the govem-
ment and private employers.

U.S. Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis
announced in a teleconference yes-
terday the creation of a new program
called Summerjobs USA. The initia-
tive is voluntary and brings together
private companies and government
oﬂices at both the local and national

   

levels. ‘
So far, companies have pledged to

' create 40,000 jobs for 16- to 24-year-

olds, a group that last summer saw its

highest rate of unemployment since’

EM8.
But Solis did not say how the pro-
gram will hold companies to their
pledges and did not set deadlines for
employers or mention any incentives
forthemto participate. Thatinfom1a-
tionwas notavailable onthe program’s
website, which did not specify any
graduation or school year require-
ments for participants.
Solis said the initiativewas created

economy is recovering, many of them

—Mmﬁmﬁuﬂﬁmkmﬁmﬁdm. A
“Lastjuly, unemployment of 16 to H

24 year-old demographicwas at 19.1
percent, the highest it had been since

' 1948 —1eaving4 million people who

wanted to work unable to ﬁnd jobs.
With Recovery Act dollars gone, this is
anifnportant program to ensure that
yetmg people are able to ﬁnd work,”
Solis said. I

The Bureau of Labor Statistics re-
ports similar ﬁgures on its website.

With thousands of job commit-
ments already from UPS; Wells Fargo

   

and Research in>Motion," Solis hopes
that other businesses, botl1 large and
small, will get involved as well.

Many of the companies and agen- , 

cies span across several states, includ-
ing Pennsylvania. It’s not certain yet
how many jobs or internships might
be available to Pitt students. The ma-
jority of the‘-private employers who

have already pledged jobs — seven of
nine — were golf courses or ‘course

management companies.

Working to highlight the mutual

berieﬁtsbetween employers andyoung
American workers, the program was

introducedthisyearinresponseto the

expiration ofRecoveryAct dollars and

‘ alack of federal ﬁmding.

The program will use existing

: workforce services in local neighbor-

hoods to coordinate these jobs, Solis
said. Those interested canstop byOne'-

the people with buying power,” Watts said.

Aside from yesterday’s Ride and Drive event,
the team has hosted Take Charge events at Pitt’s
School of Medicine, Benedum Hall and the Katz
Graduate School of Business to reach out to its
target market.

Senior Zak Prauer, the group’s public rela-
tions -representative, said the marketing team
hopes to send a message to “take charge of the
future, take charge of being responsible about
[consumers’] purchase decisions and hopefully
encourage a movement towards people engag-

ll

\

ing in eco—friendly behavior.”

Watts said the campaign’s main goal is to
raise awareness of the Chevrolet brand and
the Volt in the automobile market. So far Pros-
InMotion has had ﬁve people place orders for
the Chevrolet Volt.

“We should be working on getting commis-
sion,” Watts joked.

Pitt undergrads got a taste of the vehicle
on Tuesday. The campaign team, dressed in

' neon yellow shirts, attracted students to the

silver Volt parked in the Schenley Quad with

A music, free food and a raffle offering giveaways

such as a Keurig coifemaker and an iHome
clock—radio.

The team’s mascot, “the»Voltman” — a play
off the Green Man from the popular show “It’s
Always Surmy in Philadelphia” — pranced
around the Quad in a green body suit painted
with a lightening bolt emblem, posing for pic-
tures with students.

Prauer said the team hoped to get students
directly interacting with _the vehicle.

quad to slide into the black leather backseat of
the Volt and immediately squealed.

“Oh wow this is so awesome,” she said. “I
love it, can I take it home?”

Other students shared similar reactions to

. the Volt’s large touch screen navigation sys-

tem, which displays the car’s battery life as
well as a meter that rates the driver’s driving
eﬂiciency.

Prauer said the Chevrolet Volt is unique in

that_it runs on electricity and gas. The Volt gets
30 to 35 miles with electric charge and then an
onboard gas generator kicks in to power the
electric engine. Once the gas generator powers
up, the car gets about 37 miles per gallon.

The car can be plugged into an average
three-prong outlet and Prauer said it costs
about $1.50 to charge a day. ,

Christine Salvador, Chevrolet’s district man-
ager of the Pittsburgh region, said Chevrolet’s
goal in appearing on campuses is to create ex-
citement and awareness of its brand with young
people heading out into the work force.

EdVenture Partners, a local marketing
education consultancy, ﬁrst connected Pitt
students to Chevrolet. Torn Cronin, EdVenture
Partner’s account manager, said the program
aims to provide marketing students with real-
world experience.

“We are the intermediaries,” he said. “We
connect campaigns to universities [and] pro-
vide students with hands-on learning.”

Gilbert said that Chevrolet and other cor-
porations that have worked with ProsInMotion
are not only happy to give students opportuni-
ties —- they have their own motives as well.

“They know that Generation Y is very dif-

’ ﬁcult to reach using normal marketing tech-

9

niques, ’ he said. “So they get Generation Y
themselves to reach out to Generation Y.”

To reach the student generation and pro-
mote the Volt, ProsInMotion developed a blog
and a Facebook page, as well as Twitter and
YouTube accounts. T

Gilbert highlighted the marketing expe-
rience students gain in his class. In the past,
ProsInMotion has worked with the Pittsburgh
Pirates, the RecordingAssociation of America,
Honda and the Central Intelligence Agency.

“They get an unbelievable chance to run and
operate their own agency,” he said. “They get an
ability to feature this on their resume — an op-
portunity that differentiates themselves against
people they are competing with for jobs.”

The team is organized into a full-service
marketing communications agency. Gilbert
splits the team into four departments: re-
search, campaignstrategy, public relations
and advertising. One person serves as agency
coordinator.

Prauer estimates he probably put 20 to 25
hours a week into the campaign.

“It’s a pretty big commitment,” he said.
“Most of us are graduating in a year, and this is
the highlight of our marketing career at Pitt.”

ProsInMotion hopes to have a Chevrolet
Volt or Equinox at Pitt’s Relay For Life on Fri-
day. Q l A "

more than just summer jobs to be taken and for-
gotten; the federal government hopes they will
help young adults gain new skills as well as build
potential careers within these corporations.

For instance, Rodney Moses of Research in
Motion made it clearthatthe summer jobs are not
about making copies and getting coffee.

“'I‘heywillbe working on design, and actually
working to improve our products,” Moses said.
“These young people represent a large portion
of our customer base and hearingfeedbackﬁom
them is extremely beneﬁcial to us.”

Stressing the impact summer jobs have in
providingyoungpeople with knowledge of career
options and required skills, Solis said summer
employmentis key inbuildingabetterAmerican
workforce.

According to Pitt’s Student Employment and
PlacementAssistance 2009-2010 internship re-
port, of about700 students surveyed, 64percent
interned overthe summers of 2009 and 2010. The
report did not state howmanystndents had been
working in other positions last summer.

The University will also hold a summer job
fair next Wednesday from noon to 3 p.m. in the
William Pitt Assembly Room, whichwill include
more than 75 potential employers.

John Stumpf, CEO and president of Wells
Fargo, said that this year his company will look
for1,000 college and M.B.A. students toﬁllposi-
tions over the summer.

“We really View this as a triple win,” Sturnpf
said. “Itis a greatwayto discover new and young
talent, as well as an opportunity for the students
and team members ofWells Fargo to learn from
each other. In addition to that, the country ben-
eﬁts by getﬁng a stronger work force.”

Another common thread echoedbyUPS and
RIMwasthe ideathat not onlyarethese positions
for the summer, but they are looking to grow
careers as a result of these summer jobs.

Betty Amend, vice president of human re-
sources atUPS, said that she started as asummer

“While the positions are only part time over
the summer, we do have the intention of growing

volunteers in such a short period of time.”

Okada said thatthere aremany lessons for GS-
PIAst11dents and otherstotakeout ofthejapanese

focus heavily on the relief efforts.

“It is important to ask how do big organiza—
tions and small organizations interact and over-
come massive damages like this, particularly

important to always ﬁnd ways to improve.”

Another GSPIA student, Tomomi Korenaga,
closed the eventwith aquick presentation on the
best ways for Pitt students to get involved with

She said the best move for U.S. students is to
work with groups that are already well-estab-

No harm in
showing skin

The human body is a work of art
—— just one that, for many Ameri-
cans, merits censorship.

Last week, the Washington
Post reported that a woman at the
National Gallery in Washington,
.D.C., attacked a Gauguin painting
titled “Two Tahitian Women.”
The painting features two women
with uncovered breasts standing
side by side.

As foolish as it sounds, this
act of body-bashing was no iso-
lated incident: In late February,
the Minneapolis Star—Tribune re-
ported that a bare—chested Venus
on a Minneapolis Institute of Art
billboard was spraypainted over
with red clothing. The goddess’s
new uniform was accompanied
by the word “Brrr!”

Paul Rosenblatt, a family so-
cial science professor at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota, noted in

the article that such an act isn’t»

entirely inexplicable.

“I can really understand why
there are plenty of people who,
from their own cultural perspec-
tive, would really be uncomfort-
able,” Rosenblatt said.

This “cultural perspective”
— favoring modesty at all costs
—- is, of course, hardly an anom-
aly in a mainstream society that

takes its roots from Puritanism: .

many Americans seem wary to
approve risque clothing and even
less likely to tolerate full-frontal
nudity. In some situations, this
is understandable — who would
want constant exposure to naked
body images? — but sometimes,
we think this reticence goes a
little far.

We understand it’s natural for
Americans to feel uncomfortable

around naked bodies. For most
of our lives, we’re conditioned
to dress modestly, keep contact
to a minimum and keep our eyes
to ourselves.

Unfortunately, this condition-
ing often renders us unable to
cope with natural images of the
body. The key to this to remedy-
ing this, we think, is addressing
the subject of human sexuality
early and tactfully. Otherwise,
taste wars will persist.

Take the case of Shady Grove
Elementary School in Henrico,
Va., for example. Oncareer day,
a plastic surgeon visited a group
of fourth—graders, as he did every
year, the town’s local NBC affili-
ate reports. His student-friendly
activity? Allowing the students to
feel breast implants. Predictably,
some parents became irate and
took to Facebook to vent their
frustration.

“That should have been dis-
cussed before presenting to the
children!!” one parent wrote.

Regardless of what you think
of the price or the safety of im-
plants placed in the body, the
object in itself —just sitting on
display in a classroom — isn’t
harmful.

Nevertheless, we agree with
the parent: A dialogue with pre-
teens is long overdue. That way,
we think, relatively innocuous
depictions of every—day objects
that just happen to have sexual
implications —— be they paintings
or implants — won’t engender a
fierce backlash.

In any case, we at The Pitt
News are perfectly comfortable
with the human bodyzjust look at
our most recent Sex Edition. I

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

As shown by acne, braces and school
picture day, some things from high
school are best left in the past. This
includes how we stereotype artists
and jocks. - '
This isn’t the start of a Disney
Channel-style column about how
thelabels stifle personal develop-
ment and gloss over the intricacies
of human ability —— that colunm has
been written too many times. Nor is
this about how the two groups are se-
cretly the same. After all, abasketball
star 'can’t just pick up a microphone
and start belting “Aida.”
Instead, I’m addressing the ani-
mosity that often exists between
the two groups —— how artists and
jocks interact. Be it because of an ex-
tension of these unfortunate high
school stereotypes or for more valid
reasons, neither group seems to un-
derstand the opposing side. And —-
aside from the occasional story of
a football player learning ballet to
improve fo otwork — neither group
seems to want to take lessons from
the other, which is to the detriment
of everybody, including the general
public. .

Of course, part of this animos-
ity stems from legitimate ﬁnancial
concerns, especially on the artistic
side. For instance,'when Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette reporter Scott Mervis
recently asked Pittsburgh native
Christina Aguilera her opinions of the
city, she said that she felt like the city
was “very sports-driven” and that
“there wasn’t a whole lot of support
for the arts.” In her mind, the funds
and energy devoted to sports directly
detracted from her creative develop-
ment. Considering that many other
cities share Pittsbu@’s propensity to
devote excessive public resources to-
ward new stadiums while sirnultane—

ously stifling artistic investment, she '

is likely not alone in her opinion. - _

Yetwhatislostwhenviewingthe A

relationship -between the arts and
sports throughpurelyﬁnancialterms
is thatboth communities could gain
from more productive interactions.

Take the declining state of the
nation’s symphonies. Although
elite symphonies are maintaining
fair health, smaller symphonies
are facing serious reductions. The
Huntington Symphony Orchestra
in West Virginia recently reduced its
schedule, and the Detroit Symphony
Orchestra only just restarted its sea-
son after sufferingasix-month musi-

cian strike in response to pay cuts
from management. Compared to the
soaring proﬁts of professional sports
leagues, the contrast is stunning.

Whereas it is easy for many in the
arts community to dismiss this as
the people getting “dumber” and no
longer being appreciative of great art,
another explanation forthis contrast
might be that athletic competition is
simply doingabetter job of exploring
the themes of human passion and
emotion once reached solely through
the arts. .

Through the explosion of sports
punditry inthe past2O years by ESPN
and the Internet, we are fed more of
a narrative about sports than ever
before — a sporting event becomes
more than an athletic competition
and might become either a story
reminiscent of David and Goliath or
one of a player getting the opportu-
nity to redeem past wrongs.

When these narratives are com-
pared to how classical music is often
presented — either academically
as “profoun ” beauty or cheaply as
nothing more than catchy music — it
is little wonder that the community
fails to regain relevance.

RADICALS FOR MODERATES

Pull money out, force the bargaining table

Brendan Sullivan
Columnist

Many moons ago, meaning late 2010,
talks broke down between Israel and
the Palestinian National Authority
over the former’s refusal to continue
itsfreeze on its settlementsinthe West
Bank.

Now statistics have appeared
showingthat Israeli settlements grew
fourfold in2010. In concrete numbers,
that means Israel built 6,794Jewish-
only housingunits on Palestinian land,
according to the Palestinian Central
Bureau of Statistics. The bureau is
the statistical arm of the Palestinian
National Authority, providing data
measuring Palestinian economic in-
dictors like industrial production and
price levels, but people like Sam Mel-

lits of Panthers for Israel dispute the .

research methods of this organization,
chargingthat it mighthavean intrinsic
bias inreporting. A ‘
The freeze on settlement building
isia reasonable request. The settle-
ments are in violation of the Fourth
Geneva Convention, which aims to

protect  living in a warzone, ..

and were speciﬁcally called out as ille-
gal in 2004 by the International Court
ofjustice in The Hague. '

More than this, the settlements

( are a land grab — an attempt by Is-

rael to install partisans in a land they
know is hotly contested so as to in-
crease the veracity of the claim that
Israel at its largest is a birthright for

' Israeli Jews. The British, who caused

the whole damnthinginthe ﬁrst place,
usedasirnilartacticinthe early 1600s,
transplantingscotch-Irish and British
Protestants to Northern Ireland. And
aswe saw, the transplantation resulted
inabloody, drawn—out conflict known
as the Irish Confederate Wars.

\ Sarah Moawad of Students for
justice in Palestine noted that settle-
ments can be used as a type of group

‘punishment. According to Moawad

and several news sources, after the
cold-blooded murders of ﬁve Israeli
settlement dwellers, Israeli Prime Min-
ister Benjamin Netanyahu held a spe-
cial meeting on settlements to allow
500 more units to be builtinresponse.

‘ All West Bank Palestinians are being

punished for the crimes of a few.
Now that I’ve signiﬁcantly alien-
ated at least halfof my readers, I’ll say
this — the Palestinian Authority is just
as stubborn, intransigent and wrong
as the Israeli government.
It continues to wage a guerrilla

K campaign againstboththe Israeli mili-~

tary and civilians, it refuses’ to make

any commitment to peace talks With-
out unconditional terms, and Fatah
and Harnas, the two largest factions of
Palestinians, continue to_ ﬁght among
themselves.

In fact, the further my research
spiraled down the Middle East rab-
bit hole, the more hopeless I began to

feel. The problems thatblockapathto

$400 million in aid to the Palestinian
Authority each year. What we must do
for as long as these two parties reﬁrse
to compromise or talk at all is with-
drawallofourﬁnancial support. These
groups rely on American aid to wage
war on each other, and the removal of
it~— allof it, forboth sides ——will drive
them to the bargaining table faster

peace can feel insurmountable. Each

’ party inthis situation is obsessedvvith

its own victimization, while in truth
theyare both aggressors usingpast in-
justices to legitimize the injustices they
both currently perpetrate. Both sides

are bullies. Both sides are wrong.
So what can the United States gov-

‘ emment do to stop these two groups

from beating each other into a pulp
and destabilizing an entire region?
Well, giving up on a demand for a
moratorium on settlements certainly
won’t help.

than any reasoned argument.

What they do when they get to the
bargaining table is another question.
Both sides have, at one point or anoth-
er, approved of a two—state solution,
but invariably they’ve backpedaled.
So unfortunately, we must make obsti-
may a thoroughly unpleasant option
for both parties.

In either case, why should the
American taxpayer be funding both
sides of abloody conflict? Why should
we be giving billions of dollars in
military aid to the most militarily ad-
vanced country in the Middle East or
lend millions to an organization that

regularly supports terrorist attacks

on civilians?

American involvementin this con-
flictistwisted and cancerous.We must
strip it away and begin again.

Such a plan will not be widely
supported by Jewish-Americans or
Palestinians. It makes sense —— they
have ties to a side in the ﬁght and do
not want to see their side injured in
any Way-

Buthere inthe U.S.we have awon—
derfully rational systeminwhichthose
who have emotional ties to an issue are
not given a larger Vote than anyone
else. For the same reason that those
who lost family in the Sept. 11 attacks
should not be allowed to force the
govemment’s hand onthe location
of an Islamic Community Center in
New York City, those who favor com-
promise only from the other side of
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should

i be ignored while the quest for peace

continues.

Everyone wants peace in the Mid-
dle East, but demanding unilateral
concessions from one side orthe other
is not a quest for peace — it is a quest
for victory. And when both sides act
in such a despicable manner, neither
deserves victory.Just peace.

that could be going on between the
groups. When the public ﬁnds the
personal tragedies of disgraced foot-
ball players more compelling than
that of two characters in a play, or has
more interest in exploring self-conﬁ-
dence issues when presented with a

. pitcher through the press rather than

a singer through an aria, there is little

question that the community might
have something to learn.

Before relieving professional
sports of any responsibility in this
dialogue, though, those in the sports
world should realize that they too
could learn from a cultural exchange.
Many professional sports organiza-
tions would be wise to develop a bet-

ter understanding of artistic restraint
-— the owners of the Dallas Cowboys,
who built their billion-dollar foot-
ball stadium with no TV smaller than
another, speciﬁcally could use this
lesson. ‘ A

Another good idea would befor
some leagues —— a certain national
baseball league speciﬁcally — to be

less concerned about the bottom line
and short-term success and focus
instead ‘on improving the quality and
long—term health of the game.

To be fair, much of the animosity

‘ between the arts and sports worlds
. comes from legitimate concerns

over ﬁmding. The sad thing about
this ﬁghting is that it overshadows

Despite funding differences, still chance for compromise

the beneﬁts that could be reaped
by all if the groups would look past
their differences and focus on self-
irnprovement. If the artists and the
jocks just get together and talk, we
could all get that Disney Channel
ending, after all.

The Pitt Repertory Theatre will
perform a contemporary twist on

William Shakespeare’s “As You Like

It” now through Sunday. -

The show will be held in the
Charity Randall Theatre adjacent
to the Stephen Foster Memorial.

Sam Turich, the director of
the show, said the contemporary
twist might be off-putting to those
who believe Shakespeare’s works
should only be performed in their
original Elizabethan forms.

“I’ve deﬁnitely encountered
certain strict constructionists of
Shakespeare. The thing about it
is, Shakespeare was performing

Avolio, who has been performing theater
since middle school, said she was familiar
with many of Shakespeare’s works, but this

Junior Moira Quigley, who also performs

“Sometimes someone will just get into
it — like Sarah will be doing her thing or
Chris will start freestyling and we’ll just
ride with it,” Anway said. 1

Members of The Dope Technique say au-
dience members have a spontaneous reac-
tion to their shows. Anway said sometimes
the audience is relaxed, sort of swaying to
the music, and at other times people begin
to dance in the crowd. Worthy said he’s open
to anything.

“I’ll jump in the crowd and start dancing

if they want,” he said.

The group’s members all hail from vari-
ous performance backgrounds. Anway is a
member of Pitt’s jazz ensemble, whereas
C.H.R.I.S. got his start performing poetry.

" That eclectic mix of tastes and experi-
ences lends itself to the group’s distinct
sound. Elements of classical jazz, soul and
R&B can be heard in the group’s perfor-

  
 

mances.

Anway said the manual and instrument-
based hip-hop that The Dope Technique
performs is still alive and well on the East
Coast, primarily Philadelphia and New
York.

Ultimately, Worthy said, The Dope Tech-
nique hopes to engender a re-evaluation of
hip-hop standards.

“I think a lot of rappers should have an
‘unplugged’ kind of thing, with a real live
band,” Worthy said.

Tarantino’s ﬁlms are transparent in their in-
ﬂuences — a quality that leads many critics
to dismiss his work as unoriginal. Whether or
notthis is a valid admonishment, the director’s
brand is one indisputably entrenched in pop
culture, and the niches that make such immer-
sion possible.

Painter: Akira Kurosawa

Painting is one of the few aspirations less
conducive to a steady income than directing.
Thankfully Kurosawa’s failure to succeed in stu-
dio art didn’t diminish his spirits. Instead, the

Japanese icon focused his energies elsewhere:
movies.

Fortunately for cinephiles, Kurosawa’s en-
during enthusiasm for the brush permeates all
his works, in ways both literal and aesthetic.
In “Dreams,” a surreal anthology of vignettes
completed late in Kurosawa’s career, a young
man becomes hopelessly lost in a Vincent Van
Gogh painting —— the painter himself, interest-
ingly, is played by Martin Scorsese. In virtually
all Kurosawa’s works —- particularly colorﬁlms
like “Kagemush ” — the director exercises an
unprecedented mastery of contrast and shadow.
(Fritz Lang, another visual mastermind, also
studied painting in Paris.)

Construction Worker: Jean—Luc Godard

Construction isn’t merelyaproletariat profes-
sion. Even the most revered director ir1 art-house
circles can claim familiarity with blue—collar
drudgery. In 1953, Godard worked construc-

tion on a dam in Switzerland —— an experiencg
he turned into a short documentary, “Operation
Beton” (1954), or “Operation Concrete.”

Although the ﬁlm is hardly what catapulted
Godard to cinematic stardom — a movie about
moving rubble isn’t exactly, I’d imagine, as exhila-
ratingas “Breathless” — it nonetheless provided
the ﬁlmmaker with invaluable experience. '“ ‘

Advertiser: Abbas Kiarostami and Roy An-
dersson

Commercials are often denigrated as vapid
and senseless. That doesn’t mean, however, that
the people behind them can’tbe authentic artists.
Most notably, renowned ﬁlmmakers Kiarostami
and Andersson —— respectively, the Iranian di-
rector of experimental, minimalist sensations
like “Taste of Cherry,” and the Swedish black
humorist with an impeccable eye for color and
mise—en—scene — both worked in that much-
maligned industry, marketing.

Kiarostarni, inhis early years, designed book‘-
jackets, and directed more than 150 commer-
cials, and shorts on topics like dental hygiene,
according to The New Yorker. Andersson, for
his part, became immensely respected in his ﬁeld
— fellow Swede Ingmar Bergman once deemed
his commercials the best “in the world” —— and
continues to devote to the craft a considerable
amount oftime. Infact, the directoris completely
unrepentant about his day job. “I work as me-
ticulously on [commercials] as on my feature
ﬁlms,” he told Vice Magazine. .

Borza sisters start family tradition at Pitt

Nate Barnes
Staff Writer

First came Nikki Borza, the oldest
sister who paved the way at Pitt
with 112 wins for the women’s ten-
nis team.

Then came Kristy, a current assis-
tant coach at Pitt and all-time leader
in victories.

So when it came time to choose

‘auniversity, Kimmy —— the young-
est — considered playing tennis
elsewhere.

With two older sisters who had
previously donned Panthers uni-
forms, Kimmy thought about break-
ing the family trend. But when she
contemplated possibly facing off
against Pitt in the future, Kimmy
felt like she’d be competing against
family.

“Growing up, Ithought I wouldn’t
want to go here because my sisters

gvent here,” Kimmy said. “But as I
got older I realized how many op-
portunities were here for me, and
especially that of being able to have
my sister coach me.”

The Borza sisters are carving out
a niche in Pitt tennis history, with
Kimmy and Kristy both in the top
15 in all-time wins. There’s an 11-year
difference between the oldest and
youngest sisters, and Kimmy is cur-
rently a freshman at Pitt. She has 21
wins this season, placing her as sec-
ond on the team. She’s also the ﬁnal
standout tennis player in the Borza
sister legacy. '

The beginning of a tradition

As the ﬁrst Borza to go through
the system, Nikki laid a foundation
for her younger sisters. As a fresh-
man in 1999, Nikki quickly made her

mark on the squad, posting 18 wins *

in singles play. She was also named
the squad’s Most Valuable Player.

She played at Pitt from 1999-
2003, ﬁnishing 11th in Pitt’s record
book with112 total wins, andwas an
assistant coach from 2005-2009.

Nikki, now 30, ﬁnished her career
sixth all-time in singles wins (63) and
12th in doubles victories (49).

She also planted a desire in
both Kristy and Kimmy to wear
the blue-and—gold as Kimmy and

Kristy attended almost all of Nikki’s
matches.

“Kimmy and I were always huge
Pitt tennis fans, and it did inﬂuence
us to come here when we had to make
that decision,” Kristy said. ,

After her playing career ended,
Nikki coached Kristy through her
younger sister’s four years at Pitt.

“It was a great experience to be
able to coach Kristy and be on the
courtwith her when she was doing so
well,” Nikki said. “She is an awesome
competitor and a great player.”

A second sister follows

When Kristy began her career at
Pitt, she said didn’t set out to outdo
her older sister; but rather to make
a name for herself.

“I was really nervous freshman
year, playing in our challenge match-
es to determine the lineup, because
earning a position in the lineup was
important to me,” said Kristy, now
24. '

Kristy earned that position in the
lineup and then some. Her achieve-
ments as a Panther are so numerous
that she practically earned her own

GREGORIAN RANTS

Baseball’s losers could end up on top this year

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

 

. 
The Orioles? The Royals? The  Pi-
rates? Winning? When did this hap-
pen?

Combined, thesethreefranchises
lost nearly 300 games last season. But
ienteringwednesday, theywere acom-

ﬁbined 11-3 and were three of the ﬁve
most impressive clubs in the league.
That’s right —- I’m grouping them in
 Texas and Philadelphia.

Back in September, I envisioned

a path to the postseason for the bot-

«tom-feeder of each NFL division. As
it turned out —— and the Buccaneers
and the Rams almost did it -— the
Chiefs were the ones who made the
playoffs.

Now the Royals, Orioles and Pi-

rates are showing once againthatyou _

can’t rule anyone out before a season
starts. It’s early April, so let’s spread a
little hope around and dream about
how last yeafs baseball cel1ar-dwell-
ers could win their divisions.

AL East — Baltimore Orioles
(2010 record: 66-96)

I always listened to the wise Buck

Showalter when he worked as an _

analyst. Now he’s back to managing
and his players must be listening to
him, too.

Showalter inherited a mess of
a ball club and turned it — almost
overnight — into a good one. Since
he took over, the Orioles have had the
best record of any team in the com-
petitive division. Their pitching staff,
which is youngbutpromising, gave up
fourrunsthrough the team’s ﬁrst four

games——and that’s with pitcher Brian
Matusz on the disabled list.

So what’s the dream for Balti-
more?

The Red Sox choke again, the Yan-
kees underachieve, and the Orioles
— yes, the Orioles ——- ride into the
postseason.

AL Central — Kansas City Roy-
als (67-95)

_ When you apply to become an of-
ﬁcial baseball fan, the ﬁrst question
ontheexamasks forthe names ofﬁve
players fromthe consistently obscure
Kansas City team. With Kila Ka’aihue
and MattTreanorinthe batting order,
it’s a difficult task.

Still, the Royals have scraped up
some good players — even if you
didn’t realize they play in Kansas
City now. Jeff Francoeur and Melky
Cabrera both start. Former top-pros-

pect and current 27-year-old platoon
outﬁelder Alex Gordon is back up to
hitting .375, so maybe he’ll turn it
around aswell.

The Royals don’thave the talent of

I the Twins or the White Sox, but they

can embrace the underdog role. At
their current pace, they squeak out
85 one—run wins with their closer,

Joakim Soria. .

AL West —— Seattle Mariners
(61-101)

A trendy pick to win the division
in2010, the Mariners underachieved
big-time.

They hit .236 as a team. Felix
Hernandez had a 2.27 ERA, yet only
went 13-12 because he had so little run
support. Everybody went through a
year-long cold spell.

That won’t happen again. Seattle
can be the poster boy forthe bounce.-

back year and upend the Rangers for
the division crown.

NL East — Washington Nation-
als (69-93)

So they don’t have Stephen Stras-
burg. Big whoop. Strasburg started 12
games lastyear and won ﬁve of them.
His elbow injury — which will keep

him out all season —— will keep the .

media circus away. On the ﬁeld, the

Nationals aren’t that different. They i

actually had a better record before
Strasburg’s call-up lastjune.
Idon’t know how Philadelphiacan

falter, but Washington can’t worry _

about that. The Nationals just need
to take care of their own business.
They have some solid hitters in Ryan
Zimmerman andjayson Werth, and
if they need pitching they can always

The Pitt baseball team took a break from
Big East action this week as the Panthers
traveled to Ohio for games against Cleve-
land State and Kent State. The Panthers
found success on Tuesday, defeating the
Vikings 13-5, before falling to the Golden
Flashes 9-5 on Wednesday.

Pitt 13, Cleveland State 5

Pitt used 18 hits, including four from
senior Zach Duggan, to defeat Cleveland
State Tuesday in Avon, Ohio.

The Panthers» led by only one run at
the top of the eighth inning, but a hit-by-
pitch and a bases-loaded walk by Cleveland
State allowed Pitt to score four runs on

only two hits and take a large lead into ,

the ninth inning.

In the top of the ninth inning, Pitt
added three more runs on three hits. The
Panthers held the Vikings to one hit in the
bottom of the ninth.

Catcher Anthony Defabio led the Pan-
thers with three hits and three RBIs. Dug-
gan added one RBI while tying his career
high with four hits. He also ﬁnished with
four hits against Niagara earlier this sea-

Designated hitter Kevan Smith contrib-
uted three hits and two RBI.

Cole Taylor pitched six innings of relief
for the Panthers, earning his first win of
the year. He gave. up three hits and otfé
unearned run.

Pitt 5, Kent State 9

The Panthers dropped a back-and-forth
contest to Kent State on Wednesday as
the Golden Flashes defeated Pitt in Kent,
Ohio.

Freshman Derik Wilson led the Pan-
thers with two hits and two RBI, while
three other Pitt players also contributed

two hits — Duggan, Casey Roche andjohn '

Schultz. The two teams went scoreless
through the first ﬁve innings before the

Panthers put up two runs in the sixth in‘?

ning. _

The Golden Flashes scored three runs
in the bottom of the sixth to take a 3-2
lead, but Pitt quickly responded with two
runs in the seventh. Kent State eventually
claimed the lead for good in the eighth
inning, scoring four runs and earning its
second win over Pitt this season.

Pitt begins a three—game series against
Villanova on Friday at 3 p.m. at Charles L.

page in the Pitt tennis record book. The cur-
rent a]l—time leader in victories with 176 wins,
Kristy competed in a Panther uniform from
2005-09. '

She owns the all—time wins record by a huge
margin. With 91singles victories and 85 in
doubles — 176 wins in total .-— Kristy has a 40-
win edge over second place, current Pitt senior
Elizabeth Adams. Kristy’s resume isﬁlled with
other school records as well.

She holds the records for, most victories
in singles play in one season (28), career wins
in singles (91) and career victories in doubles
play (85).

The only Panthers tennis player to ever
be included in the Intercollegiate Tennis As-
sociation’s singles rankings, Kristy was the
2008-09 Big East/Aeropostale Institutional
Scholar—Athlete of the Year Award winner, the
2009 Blue—Gold Award recipient and Pitt’s Most
Valuable Player for three consecutive years.

The most impressive aspect of Kristy’s
numerous records is that she achieved them
while playing in the top spot in the lineup,
Nikki said.

“She was always playing the best players
from opposing teams and that just adds to how
impressive her dominance was,” Nikki said.
“I’m very proud of her and coaching her while
she was here was a thrill for me.”

Kristy said that she didn’t feel pressure to
live up to Nikki’s career.

“When I came here, and the same thing for
Kimmy, we aren’t trying to ﬁll the shoes of who
played before us,” Kristy said. “We are all each
other’s biggest fans and support each other
no matter what. So having our family behind
us, ‘especially our sisters, really helps take the
pressure off.”

Nil<ki’s and Kristy’s successful collegiate
careers have had a drastic impact on Kimmy.

“I went to alot of matches when I was little,
and at the time, I didn’t understand how great

my sisters really were,” Kimmy said. “It’s mo- _

tivating to know how well my sisters did when
they were here.”

this season

The ﬁnal chapter ~ V

Kimmy, the ‘last slsterinthe Borzaline, has
already seen success as afreshman. She’s been

in the lineup since the ﬁrst match of the year
and plays at second doubles and fourth singles.
Kimmy’s total of 21 victories, 10 in singles and
11 in doubles ranks second on the team.

As the ﬁnal player in the Borza legacy, Kim-
my, 19, said she doesn’t feel anyladded. stress.

“Having Kristy coach, and Nikkisupporting
me, really helps,” she sa|id.“Théy bothknow so
much and have reallytnade me abetter player. I
know I have their support, and it’s nice to know
that if I mess up, theygvvon’t be unhappy.” -

Kristy said she’s sure her younger sister
feels some pressure, but added that Kimmy
handles herselfwell. A ‘

“She came in to school and got a 4.0 GPA

. herﬁrst semester,” Kristy said. “Out ofthe three
of us, I think she is most equipped to handle it,
she is incredibly mature.”

Nikki said the tennis success is a great fam-
ily tradition.

“It was great to coach Kristy, and now it’s
awesome to watch Kimmy play, who all of 11
years ago was watching me out there,” Nikki
said.

Kristy added that she was proud when
Kimmy chose to play tennis at Pitt.

“Knowing that I was going to be able to
coach her and be with heras she has her experi-
ences is something that is a great experience
just for me,” she said.

Three years from now, the run of me Borza
sisterhoodwill come to an end. Most of all, Nik-
ki said she’ll miss watching her sisters play.

“We still have three years of Kimmy being
there though, so that’s really exciting,” Nikki

said. “But tennis has always been a huge part of

our lives, and so has Pitt. The coaches, Univer-
sity and Athletic Department have been won-
derﬁal to us, and we will always be around the

program even after Kimmy is done playing.”-

Pirates prospects ready to shine

Trietley 4 14

 

MCT Campus

Pedro Alvarez (No. 17) and the Pittsburgh Pirates won their ﬁrst two road series this
season and could rise from the bottom of a weak NL Central division.

ask current outﬁelder — and former pitcher

- — Rick Ankiel if he  to move back to the

mound. .

NL Central — Pittsburgh Pirates (57-
105)

Pittsburgh is in its 15th or so rebuildingyear.
A pessimist would point out that the rebuild

' isn’t working. An optimist, though, believes

that a decade and a half of acquiring prospects
for established major leaguersvhas to pay off
sometime. If you time it right, you might make
the playoffs once or twice beforeltrading for
new prospects. ‘ _

The Pirates have speed and power in their
lineup. They also have strongarms inthe bullpen
— not counting Evan Meek’s performance last
week at Chicago. With three road wins already,
they should surpass last year’s total byjune.
And, look at the NL Central. Cincinnati was

the weakest division winner last season. They’re
beatable. The Cubs haven’t had a championship-

 caliberrosterinages.AlbertPujols alreadylooks

like he’s suffering from a strained left contract

negotiation, so the Cardinals will struggle as

well.

NL West — Arizona Diamondbacks (65-
97) . - »

Teams shift in the NL West standings all the
time. The odd constant is Arizona, which ﬁn-
ished last in both 2009 and 2010.

The Diamondbacks, though, have Justin
Upton, Stephen Drew and Chris Young, 
that gives them a chance. They also acquired
the all-but-perfect pitcher Armando Galarraga
from Detroit, and that carft hurt.

It’s a longshot, but with a hot streak here and
abreakout season there, the Diamondbacks —
like everyone else — could win.
