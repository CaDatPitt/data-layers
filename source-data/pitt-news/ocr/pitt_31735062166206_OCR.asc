,TI1e True Miracle

“Peace on earth” is a ﬁtting prayer in these times of
world turmoil. Indeed it would be Wondrous if all men in
all lands could sit down safely and happily to. dinner on
December 25. Sadly, however, many peoples fear for their
lives and freedom from one meal to the next. And so our
prayer for peace is ﬁtting.

‘However, something should be added to‘ our prayer for
peace. Certainly all freedom-loving people hope for super-
natural aid for those who struggle against tyranny. Cer-

gtainly all looklgto Heaven for deliverance by a miracle.

Comes the question, what is a miracle? To outward
appearances, a miracle is something of wonder, something
that excites astonishment, a deviation from the known laws
of nature, held to be Wrought by a supernatural being,‘ a
supernatural event, Listing miracles, we are inclined to
count those popular Bible occurrences referred to down
through the ages: the splitting of the Red Sea, the “curing
of the incurable, the salavation of Noah. Always men look
to history. Always they look at other men in other ages.
But man misses an important factor in the miracle-—himself.

He doesn’t count the wonders of his own senses: that
he can hear the tinkling tree decorations, smell the sweet
Mwpumpkin pie, taste the tender turkey, feel icy snow, and see
. smiling faces. He leaves out his power to utter sounds and
his power to move about. He doesn’t count the best wonder

of all—the power to think about all these things.

Thus were it not miraculous could I stretch forth my
hand . . . Art thou a grown baby, then, to fancy that the
Miracle lies in miles of distance, or in pounds . . .‘ and
not to see that the true inexplicable.God-revealingMira-
cle lies in this, that I can stretch forth my hand at all;
that I have free Force and clutch aught therewith?
(Thomas Carlyle, “Natural Supernaturalism”). ‘

The everyday use of these faculties seem to take away

their wonder. The universal existence and the normality
-..,,,nf these faculties keep them from being miracles in the
mindsof men. ’

Nevertheless, the wonder remains that man is endowed
with powers to answer the need for “Peace on earth.” ‘It is
a mistake to look away from man while looking to Heaven.

The Highest Being reveals himself in man. WE are the
miracle of miracles . . ; the great inscrutable mystery
of God. We cannot understand’ it, we know not how to
speak of it; but we may feel and know, if we like, that
is verily so. (Carlyle, “On Heroes”).

And so man is endowed with the wonders of a miracle.

The use of these wonders is up to him. And his duty is to‘

,,,use his powers to create and maintain justice in the world.
Here is the deliverance--the true miracle.

Thus, in looking for aid in the tempest-tossed world in
which personal and national freedoms are threatened, we
seek not hope alone but man’s fulﬁllment of the hope.

The miracle need not be sudden, overwhelming explosions
of actions, but may be long-existing facts such as the facul-

ties of man. ‘Mountains need not be moved, seas needn’t
divide, ﬂoods needn’t save humanity. Man’s awareness of
his own powers is the wonder.

The direction of his faculties and of his power to think

are what we implore when we pray this season for “peace
on earth.” .

Dean Biddle
Victim of Prank
By Jubilant Fan

rDean of Men,
Biddle, served as target for a
practical joke over the week-
end.

Biddle announced Monday

that he was surprised Sunday
morning to read in The Pittsburgh
Press that he’d called off all Mon-
day classes following Pitt’s vic-
tory over Miami. The unveriﬁed
announcement, apparently report-
ed by a jubilant Pitt student, had
far-reaching results.

Biddle and the university were
beseiged with phone calls all day
Sunday from .equa1ly surprised
faculty, deans and students. ’

He reported that it was neces-
;ary for him to engage a telephone
sitter Sunday evening to answer
inquiries while he was out of his
house. Some students called from
as far away as 75 miles.

Despite ,Biddle’s quick correc-
tive announcement to the press

and radio, the prank succeeded in‘

disrupting the entire school day
Monday. Many students under-
standably failed to show up. Many
scheduled tests and class programs
had to be postponed.

The phony announcement, Bid-
dle commented, actually wasn’t
even in his authority to make.
The top Administration alone, he
stated, schedules school holidays
before the beginning of the school
year.

Apparently, a practical joke can
swing more weight at times than
an authority, but unfortunately
to more harm than good.

Phi Eta Sigma In A
Rebirthof Activity

Phi Eta Sigma Honorary Fra-
ternity is in the midst of a rebirth
of activity. Already this semester
the organization has launched the
most extensive tutoring program
ever attempted on this campus.
The organization has conducted
monthly dinner meetings, partici-
pated in national convention ac-
tivities, and reinstituted smokers,
and a thorough pledge program
for new initiates.

 

An informal smoker was held
last week in the French Room
of the Student Union. The main
purpose of the smoker was to
greet prospective members and
to outline for them the purposes
and meaning of Phi Eta Sigma.
The pledge program this year
was meant to thoroughly
acquaint prospective members
with Phi Eta Sigma.

The Fall initiation and banquet
was held yesterday in the Royal
York Dining Room. The initiation
program featured many innova-
tions adopted at the recent Na-
tional Convention in Florida. Dr.
Peter Gray, head of the depart-
ment of biological sciences, was
the honorary initiate and spoke
on, “The Case For Life.”

Congress Views Films

By MILLARD AMBDUR

Student Congress members,
at their meeting Monday, Dec.
10, saw a motion picture
which lauded the University
of Wisconsin Student Union
as, the “unifying force” on the

campus. -

The movie was designed to de-
monstarate the success of a func-
tioning student union and possibly
aid in planning of Pitt’s new stu-
dent union.

High School
Day Today

High School Leader’s Day,
an annual event sponsored by
Omicron Delta Kappa and
Mortar Board, is in progress
today. The purpose of the
day is to give high school

students a view of college life and
a chance to meet and talk with
college students.

According to Chairmen Neal
Zweig and Suzanne Roche, there
will be some 78 high school stu-
dents from Pittsburgh and vicin-*e\,
ity attending the scheduled events.

The planned scheduled is as
follows: This morning, all stu-
dents attended an orientation‘
meeting and they visited college
classes accompanied by meni- -
bers of ODK and Mortar Board.
A luncheon was served in the‘,
Panther Room. ‘ /

At 1:30 p.m. they toured stu-
dent activity areas, and at 2:30
p.m. attended the Beaux Arts pro-_
gram.

The Beaux Arts show, first /~‘

presented by the Women’s
Speech Association on Nov. 15,
was selected by Mortar Board
and ODK to be re—presented to
the high school students. ‘ '

Included in the program is a
debate with Harriet Laby, Ed. ’57,
defending “Pitt 1984” against
Sandra Johnston, Ed. ’57, defend-
ing “outdated Pitt 1956.”

Edward R. Tomorow moderated
the debate. A program of songs
and dances by Pitt Coeds, Men's
Quartet, and the Pitt Dance
Group and scenes from Rossum’s
“Universal Robots” and “The
Man Who Came to Dinner” are

By Irv Jacobs

__ In this crazy world, we often ﬁnd thata whole-
some intention conﬂicts with another equally ‘de-
sirable intention. In general, the idealistic aim

 must be tempered by considerations of practical

needs. _ ~
, Such a conﬂict has been brought up by the
recent Student Congress resolution moving _\ for a

ditions around which Pitt oper-
ates reveals this conﬂict.

y it must first of all be recog-
nized that at present there is a
large following of Pitt fans who’

through the years, is composed
or loyal fans and alumni whose _

interest in Pitt has never wanted through either

Jean or successful seasons. There is today, in’ fact,

in large waiting list of fans: hoping to obtain season

 books, should they become available.

Loyal students may discount these facts by’
claiming that the university is a student institu-
tion and should be ‘run primarily for the students.

_ ‘ Though this is partially so, it is not absolutely
"‘true‘at Pitt.

Not Isolated . «  « - -

The University of Pittsburgh is not an isolated
schoolhouse, independent unto itself. Situated in a
large city, the University derives large beneﬁts

J from, and in turnowes responsibilities to the pub-

lic. These responsibilities extend even into the area

‘of providing entertainment and source of pride to

the public. .

. Especially in consideration ofPittsburgh’s recent

growth. are these two’ responsibilities important.
Local people are proud to associate the Panthers
with Pittsburgh. Public interest and pride in the
golden Panthers is indeed just ..as justified and.de-
 as is student interest. a e * J‘

_   from another ‘standpoint, the uniquenesshof the

:

-a

policy.‘ It is tfue that many Pitt students live off
campus andfor hold jobs, so they. are unable
topperform as fully, enthusiastic Pitt rooters; This

V is perfectly understandable, but the resultant fact

of the matter‘ is that Pitt students dovynot ﬁll the

. student sections at most games. It is worthwhile to

note that, for certain Tsellout games,.the only un-
ﬁlled sections have been those reserved for the
students. A - C
'Leﬂ'over' Section . - ~ ..

Despite this, Pitt students are not ill-treated
by any :means in the allottment of the student
seats. Our section, stretching from" the goal to the
30-yard line, cannot be considered as “leftovers.”
It is a curious fact that, though this section in-

cludes 7000 seats, the top student attendance ever‘

recorded is 5900. Nevertheless, only once have
empty seats in this section been opened to accom-
modate overﬂow crowds; this was; for the critical
West Virginia game last year.

Strangely enough, however, the new proposal.

is probably riiost undesirable by way of its in-

‘ direct conﬂict with student interests. It turns out
‘that the revenue obtained from selling the choicest

tickets is a necessity for balancing the athletic
budget. Some eighty percent of the annual $4,-
_500,000 athletic budget is accounted for by foot-
ball revenue, as stated by Frank Carver, graduate
manager of athletics. ' o

The budget covers the expense. of supplying and
maintaining all _Pitt’s varsity teams. The good that
football revenue provides, then, cannot be consid-
ered. as apart from the student, for indeed there
would -be no teams to support at all should, such
income be discontinued. ’

It should be additionally noted that - any net-

annual income from the athletic receipts is used

. to retire the still-existing debts owed on the sta-

dium, iield house, and other university facilities.

V In light of these considerations, the Congress”

proposal must be reorganized only as an ill-com

Christmas Similaritiesiyi

By Tess Klein ’ q '
Although the Jewish Chanukah and the Christian Christmas are
holidays of people of differ'ént faiths, it is interesting to note the

'sirnilar;ways in ‘which they are observed, ,
There is a display of special lights for each holiday. People of.»

the Jewish faith use the Menorah, a nine‘-setting candelabra, to hold,"

candles which are lit one a day foreight consecutive days, the
one representing the light for theentire, period.
Burned Oil  J ‘ . A

This is done in commemoration of the rededication of the,Temple
over 2100 years ago, when, in celebration of their victory, the Jewish

ninth

people burned a few drops of oil. The oil, which ordinarily should. i

have lasted ‘for one day, miraculously burned for eight days.

At the same time of the year as. Chanukah, the Christians display
the special Christmas, lights in observance of their holiday. Cande-
labras, very. similar to the Jewish Menorah, but with six or eight
settings, are used to hold the colorful lights seen in windows of their
homes. Although the Christmas tree, with colorful lights, is onlypan
observance of‘the Christians, there is a similarity in the fact that, as
with the Jewish holiday, there is special meaning for one special

light. Atop the Christmas tree is found‘ the star-light, or the angel- ~..
light, representing the light in the sky which the three, Wise Men?‘

saw and which announced the birth of the Messiah. A
Custom Observed ‘ e  ,
Another custom observed by both Jewish and Christian people
is the exchange of gifts. Homes of both faiths know the-excitement ,
of planning surprise giftsand the happiness of giving ,and receiving
greetings and gifts. It has also been a custom of both peoplesto re-
member the less fortunate especially at this time of the year, as they

, observe the plight of others in distant lands, both faiths are adopting

charitable means on a large scale in preference to exchanging gifts,
with friends and loved ones at home. A

The similarity in the observances and customs of the Christians”
and Jews makes one wonder if therein lies the key to a common
understanding: “light” and “giving.” -

“air” in its name, by means

Another gift that is always welcome is a book, espe-
cially to people who read. This Christmas the selection
of books is particularlygattractive. For lovers of an-
thologies, there is William Makepeace Sherpa’s A Treas-
ury of the. World’s Great Treasuries. For those who fancy
inspiring success stories, there is the stirring autobi-
ography of William Makepeace Pemmican entitled How
I Got a Forty Pound Moulcey Q17 My Back and Started
the Duluth Zoo. For devoteesof skin—diving, there is
I Married at Snorkel by Lydia Makepeace Watershed. For
calorie counters and waistline watchers, there is Harry
Makepeace Wildfoster’s Eat ¢md’Grow Fat.

My own favorite book this season is a pu1se—pounding
historical novel from that famous author of pulse-pound-
ing historical novels, Daphne Makepeace Sigafoos. This
one is called Egad and Zounds, and it tells the poignant
romance of two young lovers, Egad and Zounds, who,
alas, can never be married, for ﬁery Egad is but a gypsy
lass, while tempestuous Zounds is 3. Kappa Sigma. They
later become Ludwig of Bavaria. i ,

‘Tech One of Best’—1\/Iichelosen

Coach Dodd.Nods
Verification; QB
Mitchell Leads Foe

By MURRAY CHASS
The word “best” has been
used by many football coach-
es to describe their own teams
or another squad. And so it
is with the two opposing coaches
in the upcoming Gator Bowl.
Bobby Dodd doesn’t claim that
his Georgia Tech team is the best
in the nation, but he does say that
it is “the best Tech team I have
ever had.” Panther tutor ‘John
Michelosen offers this bit of in-
formation on the Yellow Jackets.
“They are deﬁnitely one of the
best teams in the country,” Mich-
elosen says. ‘
These two successful mentors.
are not just talking, though. The

KEN OWEN
Tech’s running ace

facts back them up. The Engi-
neers lost only one of ten games
this year, that one being to the
second nationally ranked team,
Tennessee, 6-0. And that touch-
down was just one of ﬁve that
were scored against the Atlanta
eleven. In all, Dodd’s defense
gave up a mere‘33 points to its
opponents.

Leading this almost invincible
defense is safetyman Wade Mitch-
ell. Mitchell, who is a quarterback
on offense, is remembered by Pan-
ther fans for his performance in
the Sugar Bowl. But he is only one
of the many Tech players who are
back for the rematch with the
locals.

The other signal-caller, Toppy
Vann, is not as effective on de-
fense as Mitchell, but he is the
better passer of the two.

The Jackets are two deep in
the other three backﬁeld posi-
tions, also. Paul Rotenberry and
Stan Flowers run from the left
halfback slot and Jimmy
Thompson and George Volkert
are the right-halfs.

At fullback Tech can call upon
either Ken Owens, the punter of
the team, or Dick Mattison. Both
seniors are considered among the
fastest men on the team.

in the air they have traveled 65

These statistics are somewhat
remindful of last week’s Miami

Steel Bowl Tourney
Shows Local Teams

By ED KOLTISKA
With Bowl talk dominating the conversations these days,
Coach Bob Timmon’s hoopsters are getting into the act one
step ahead of the gridders as they participate in two bowl

games within two weeks.

The Steel -Bowl, featuring Du-O

quesne, Carnegie Tech, Geneva,
and Skyscraper U., will highlight
this week’s basketball activities.
Duquesne and Geneva will open
up the tournament at 7:30 p.m.
Friday while the Panthers tangle
with the Tartans in the night cap.

place honors. . _
‘ Green Gone

This year, the Steel Bowl
championship is rated a toss-up
with Tech a long shot to win the
title.

Although the Dukes have
dominated the Bowl in recent
years, the graduation of All-
American Si Green has crip-
pled the Duquesne scoring at-
tack. This is the ﬁrst time in
years that the Dukes have not
been mentioned among the top
-teams of the nation.

Last year, Green was the straw
that broke the camel’s back as
the Dukes gave the Panthers a
back seat in a lopsided 71-49 score
Not only did Green take the game
high score honors with 22 points,
but he also dominated the re-
bounds for the Bluffites.

Blair Leads Covies

Coach Dudey Moore,. who has
built this year’s team around Jack
Sauer and Dave Ricketts, will en-
ter the weekend fray with a 2-1
record. Coach Moore is banking
heavily on Bob DePalma, the big-
gest man on the Duquesne squad,
to get out of the habit of picking
up ﬁve fouls early in each con-
test.

The consclation prize last year
was claimed by Geneva as they
slid by Westminister with a
three-point margin, 60-57. With
a veteran lineup returning, the
Covies will undoubtedly prove
troublesome to most of the con-
tenders.

The high scoring of Bill Blair
and John Swogger has led Geneva

‘to three straight wins. In his last

start against West Virginia’ Wes-
leyan, Blair racked up 35 points.
Swogger in turn dumped in 21
points to help lead the Covies to
an easy 87-65 victory.
Rebounding Aces ,
Coach Bob Timmons will enter
the tournament ‘with a highly im-
proved veteran squad. Chuck
Hursh, John Riser, Julius Pegues,
and Bob Lazor were starters in

  EDIBLE SPORTASHIRTS?

Among the sort of sport shirts
that Van Heusen refuses to
make are the following:

Sport shirts that light upin
the dark: These are the. kind
that ﬂash messages, like “Hey,
baby, you’re a honey,” or
“Pass the ashtray, please.”
Useful for parties, faculty teas
and cotillion balls. But they
tend to commercialize the
graceful art of conversation.

Sport shirts with road maps
on them: Too dangerous. Say
you’re driving from campus
to the big city. You don’t know
whether to turn 13ft or right
at the turnpike, so you look
down at your shirt to, check.
Crash! p

Edible sport shirts: Too mis-
leading. You’re sitting under a
shady tree with your favorite
co-ed. She rests her head gently

     

x3

on your chest. You think she’s
fond of you. Suddenly you hear
“munch, munch,” and there
goes your delicious shirt! It
was it she craved, not you!
But the sport shirts that
Van Heusen does make are
fascinating. Dashing checks,
interesting plaids, splendid
stripes, solids in some very
unusual colors. Their cut is
free and comfortable . . . their
style is original and flattering.

that your campus haberdasher
proudly displays.

Cross Exam

  Meet Held

Northwestern University,
with a total of 120 points, won
the rotating Crucible Steel
Award this past weekend in
the Ninth Annual Cross Ex-

amination Tournament held
at Pitt.

The Pitt Debate Team ﬁnished
fourth, marking this year as the
first in the past three that it was
not a winner.

The trophy awarded to the best
Afﬁrmative Team went, to West
Point. Although Northwestern got
the top Negative Team score of 62,
they could not, by the policy of
Men’s Debating Association, claim
another trophy. The top Negative
Team Trophy then went to Ford-
ham University with a score of 61.

Florida Tops Southern Cal

At the Saturday afternoon Pub-
lic Debate in Foster Memorial, the
University of Florida defeated the
University of Southern California.

Hughes of Wake Forest won the
top speaker award with a score of
33. Levy of the University of Ver-
mont and Borden of Northwestern
tied for second place with 32 as
score. Six students from various
schools received third place speak-
er awards with scores of 31. They
are as follows: Connally of Ford-

’ham University, Lanzarone of

Fordham University, Miller of the
University of Southern California,
Scott of Kenyon College, Stein of
West Point and Wright of West
Point.

The banquet held in honor of
the visiting debate teams Fri-
day night was highlighted by
the speech of Philander Claxton
of the Department of State. He
spoke on the new Soviet econ-
omic diplomacy, which has
changed signiﬁcantly from the
time of Stalin’s death.

Mr. Claxton stated, “Since Sta-
lin’s death Communist strategy
abroad has been signiﬁcantly alt-
ered. Especially since the Summit

meeting in 1955, the USSR has.

seemed anxious to avoid a gen-
eral war, no doubt in recognition
of the almost unlimited destruc-
tiveness of nuclear weapons.
Soviet Bent on Expansion

“What we see then is a Soviet
Communism anxious to avoid war,
but bent on expansion, by means
aimed at the overthrow of exist-
ing institutions with a minimum
risk of forceful retaliation by non-
Communist countries. Such a pol-
icy must ﬁnd expression on many
levels other than military.

“Even though the USSR con-
tinues to put vast resources of ma-
terials and technology into the
arms race and Soviet theoreticians
are occupied in trying to recon-
cile peaceful coexistence with the
revolutionary nature of Commu-
nism, its external policies strive
to convince the world that the
USSR is peaceful.”
