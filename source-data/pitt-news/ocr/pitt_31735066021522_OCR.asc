Youngest heart recipient
still in critical condition;

5 The youngest patient ever to

survive a heart transplant is still
in critical condition at Children’s
Hospital of Pittsburgh.

Doctors are treating 10-day-
old Sarah Kelton with antibiotics
for an infection, said Children’s
spokesperson Toby T rosky.

Kelton’s dosage of the anti-

 . rejection drug FK506 has also

been decreased to ward off the
infection. Anti-rejection drugs
help the body accommodate the
new organ, but they also weaken
the immune system’s resistance
to infection.

“The infection is a setback in
terms of her recovery, but the
doctors are optimistic that the
increased dosage of antibiotics
will combat the infection,” Trosky
said. Infection is a common
problem among transplant
recipients, she said.

Drs. Pedro dcl Nido and John
performed the

transplant last week. Armitage
said last week that infection was
the greatest risk to the operation.
He said her chances for survival
were 50 to 60 percent.

Kelton’s doctors “can’t predict
how‘ long she will be in the
intensive—care unit, ” according to
Trosky. An echocardiogram
showed that Kelton’s heart was
functioning well, Trosky said.

Kelton was delivered by
Caesarian section Sept. 8. She
was five weeks premature and
weighed about 5.2 pounds.

Kelton was diagnosed with
hypoplastic left-heart syndrome
at Allegheny General Hospital as
a 17—week—old,fetus. Her heart
had two chambers instead of the
normal four. She also had a
condition where oxygenated
blood can’t return .to the heart
because of small pulmonary
arteries.

After the diagnosis doctors at
Allegheny General referred
Kelton to the pediatric transplant
program at Children’s Hospital.

Passive
smoking

linked
to deaths

By Jackie Estkowski
Staﬂ‘ W1-iter

Susan arrived at a bar on a
Friday night and ordered a drink.
The bar was packed; people were
standing elbow to elbow.

The man sitting next to Susan
nudged her and asked for a light.

Susan said, “No, I don’tsmoke,”
and asked him not to light up
while sitting next to her.

The man laughed as he found
someone else to light his cigarette
and smoked away, while Susan
breathed in his smoke.

Passive smoke kills 53,000 non-
smokers each year, according to
a 1991 report by researchers at
the University ofCalifornia at San
Francisco.

The report also linked heart
disease and passive smoke. It
estimated that 53,000 non-
smokers die annually from heart
disease contracted from passive
smoke; 5,700 die from lung
cancer, and 12,000 die from other
cancers.

Inhaling passive smoke is
usually the equivalent of smoking
one cigarette a day, according to
Dr. Lewis Kuller, chairperson of

‘epidemiology of the Graduate
School of Public Health. But the
degree of exposure depends on
how long and how much smoke
is taken in, he said.

“Tobacco smoke is like a
pollutant from a steel mill,” Kuller
said. “The smokers are like a
factory. They’re both a source of
pollution, and there are many

' risks associated with each of
them.”

According to Kuller, passive
smoke can:

 

non—smokers

-increase the risk of heart attack
and heart disease

-increase respiratory illnesses
-decrease a baby’s birth weight
-cause eyes to tear and effect

Credit transferproble

Primm of CGS admissions said.

Staff Writer

Credits can be transferred easily between
Pitt’s College of General Studies and the
College ofArts and Sciences, but there are
more problems with transferring credits
from outside schools, according to CGS
and CAS officials.

“Unless students are suspended, their
credits from Pitt are. always Pitt credits,
and that makes transferring to ‘another

Primm said a CGS student wishing to
transfer into CAS must first earn 18 credits
in CGS and have a cumulative grade—point
average of 2.5.

.CAS students who want to transfer into
CGS don’t have to earn a minimum number
of credits, but they must have a cumulative
GPA of 2.0. .

CAS students who want to take an
evening class can take courses that are

 .

cross-listed between the two schools. But
most CGS courses are not offered to CAS
students, Primm said.

Pitt restricts the transfer of credits from
other schools, and transfer students risk
losing credits, said \X/.E. Deskins, associate
dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.

Deskins said Pitt only accepts transfer
credits if it offers the same courses.

“This is because the nature of the courses
usually differ," he said. Some classes will
be under a different name, but the same

ms limited to oz/ttsideuniz/ersities

coursework is required, he said.

“In these cases, the dean's office will
refer the transfer request to the proper
department where the decision will be
made,” Deskins said. “The student also
has the opportunity to appeal.”

CAS students wishing to get Pitt credit
from another institution must get CAS
permission and approval from the proper
department, Deskins said. The last 30
credits of the. degree must be earned at

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, September 18, T1991

 

Measles, or rubeola, is caused
by a virus. It is a serious disease
characterized by high fever,
cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis
and Kop1ik’s spots.

A red, blotchy rash appears on
the third to seventh day,
beginning on the face and
becoming generalized. The rash
lasts four to seven days.
Complications that may result
include otitis media, pneumonia,
diarrhea and encephalitis.

Measles is one of the most
contagious infectious diseases.
The virus is transmitted by direct
contact with nasal or throat
secretions of infected persons,
by airborne droplets and less
commonly by articles freshly
soiled with nose and throat
secretions.

The incubation period is about
10 days from exposure toonset
of fever (about 14 days to the
appearance of the rash). The
period of communicability exists
slightly before the appearance of
the firstsymptoms until four days
after the appearance of the rash.

EEREE

Brought to you courtesy of

Measles is endemic to the
United States. Approximately
500,000 cases were reported until
1963, when a vaccine was
licensed. Since that time, the
occurrence of measles has
steadily declined, and the
measles—incident rate reached a
record low in 1983. Unfortunately
38 percent of cases occur on
college campuses.

In May 1984 the American
College Health Association
passed a_ resolution stating that
all American colleges and
universities should require all

students to present evidence of ,

immunity to measles (and other
diseases) prior to matriculation.

However, reported measles
cases continued to increase and
doubled from 1988 to 1989. Cases
were widespread on college
campuses as well as in junior-
and senior-high schools and
among preschoolers.

Additional review by various
agencies in 1989 determined that
a single dose immunization for
measles was not adequate for

 

With FRANKLIN
CARTER

lifetime immunity. The current
recommendation is that two shots
be given, one after 12 months of
age and one prior to entry in
elementary school.

It was also recommended that
because of the special living

"circumstances of college students

(clustering of susceptibles and
high mobility) that all students
entering college be required to
have two doses of measles
vaccine.

During October 1989 the
immunization program of the
Pennsylvania Department of
-Health surveyed the state's 148

Measles Vaccine required for entering students

public and private colleges and
universities to obtain information
concerning cu rrent immunization
programs.

As a result of the survey

findings, the Immunization‘

Program of the Pennsylvania
Department of
recommended that all colleges
and universities adopt mandatory
immunization requirements.

The recent outbreak ofmeasles
in the Philadelphia area this past

"spring, with eight deaths
attributed to the disease, can only
emphasize the importance of this
recommendation.

Representatives from several
local colleges and universities
met with the Allegheny County
Health Department this spring to
discuss prevention of measles in
the Pittsburgh area.

Assured of county support for
immunization, Pitt, , Carnegie
Mellon and LaRoche College
instituted mandatory
immunization requirements for
the 1991-92 school year.

Pitt djfirmdtiz/e dction director former ciz2il—rigbtS activist

By Eric Hoch
stay Writer

William Savage has been active
in civil rights since he marched
on Washington, D.C., as an
elementary—school student in the
early ’6OS.

Savage, who currently heads
the University of Pittsburgh’s
affirmative—action program, grew
up in a federal housing project in
Chicago. 9

After high school, Savage
attended the University oflllinois
at Urbana-Champaign and
received his bachelor’s degree in
education. He said he wanted to
make a difference, like many
students during the late 1960s.

“It was a different time —— all
students came to college with a
mission,” Savage said. “They

' wanted to learn and take what

they learned back to their
communities.” '

In college, Savage began
Program 500, designed to bring
more minorities into the
university. According to Savage,
only 55 of 5,000 incoming students
were minorities. Project 500’s goal
was to have 500 minority students
enrolled in the next first—year
class. ‘

“Things moved slowly until the
Martin Luther King assassination,
after which the university took
part in our program. That summer
I was employed with a stipend to
head up a recruitment program
in Chicago. That fall the freshman

BARBECUE

   

class had 650 minority students,
well above our desired goal.
Students wanted to take
advantage of the opportunity 
and many of those students have
had success following college.”

Savage used his recent trip to
the dentist as an example.

“The dentist greeted me as Bill
Savage, and I recognized him as
one of the people I recruited,”
Savage said. “At the time I
recruited him, he was reading
meters.”

Savage said having a work force
and student body that reflects the
population should be the goal of
affirmative action, rather than
quotas.

But Savage does not rule out
using them if necessary.

“The law allows quotas as
remedies for discrimination,"
Savage said. “‘Quota’ is a
buzzword used by someone who
doesn’t want to deal with
misrepresentation. Quotas are not
a part of affirmative action but
are permissible under certain

conditions when the court has
found a discrimination problem.”

Everyone at the university
needs to work against
discrimination on campus, he
said.

“It is also an individual
responsibility of all students to
come together, to make this a
better place for people no matter
what their race, gender, ethnicity,
religion, background. The
university should be creating an
environment that will enhance
and facilitate learning.”

Before he came to Pitt, Savage
worked at his alma mater, the
University of Illinois, as assistant
chancellor and director of
affirmative action. Joseph Smith,
a former colleague, misses him.

“If I had to use one word to
describe him, it would be
‘integrity,”’ Smith said.

“He was a confidante. You .,
could talk to him without fear of

being taken advantage of or being
exposed for having an unpopular
opinion,” he said.

Dan Buczynski/The Pitt News
Pitt afﬁr-mativc action head William Savage says universities must
create an atmosphere of diversity.

THE prrr NEWS, Wednesday, September 18, 1991

By Sandy Lasswell
For T be Ptu News

Are most College of General Studies
students over the hill, boring and less on
the ball than College of Arts and Sciences
students?

“Emphatical1yno!” said Cindy Dunn,
vice president of the CGS Student
Government Council.

The council is looking for ways to
update the image of CGS students, Dunn
said.

According to Dunn, many people think
CGS courses are easier than their CAS
counterparts and professors cut CGS
students a break by not demanding as
much work from them.

“Not so,” Dunn said. “The courses,
professors and workload are the same as
those of day students.”

A few years ago the average age of CGS
students was 53; now it is down to 27.
Many students are the same age as CAS
students, but they attend classes in the
evening because of work commitments.

To help dispel the “old fogy” stereotype
of the evening student, Dunn pointed out
that some Pitt athletes are CGS students.
Steve Israel, a defensive back for the
Panthers, is a CGS student.

The council asked CGS students if the
name “CGS" should be changed and, ifso,
what the new name should be.

One student said that the current name
sounds too much like a community college

and unprofessional. Another suggested
that the name be changed to Evening
College of Arts and Sciences.

Although only 25 survey forms were
completed, 60 percent of those answering
said they favored a name change, Dunn
said.

The council realizes that some people
think that evening students are not as
intelligent as day students. To combat this,
the council wants to gain more recognition
for the achievements of CGS students by
holding a reception in the spring honoring
all CGS scholars and recognizing excellence
in the faculty.

The CGS Student Government is also
concerned about communication between
their students and the Pitt community.

‘Night and day’ difference between CGS, CAS a myth

The Night Times, the newspaper
specifically for CGS students, has been
updated. The paper has added new
features, such as a cartoon and a humor
column, to make it more readable.

The council will also host an evening
activity designed to provide CGS students
with the opportunity to meet their council
members and discuss their concerns.

Council members will be in the CGS
lounge, located in Room 360, Cathedral of
Learning, to talk with students on Sept. 17
from 5 to 9 p.m.

Other items the council will be working
on this year include greater publicity for
CGS organizations, more use of the‘CGS
lounge and improve ment of the orientation

for new evening students.

Iraq post-
war ‘scene
from hell,’ I
says student

By Jonathan Bloch
For The Pill News

Pitt student Jill Castek, who
just returned from a two-month
stay in war—torn Iraq, described
the country as a “scene from
hell.”

Castek showed a videotape at
a Pittsburgh Students for Peace
meetingTuesday night and spoke
about the aftermath ofthe Persian
Gulf war.

“This war continues to affect
each and every single person in
Iraq,” Castek explained to an
audience of about 50 people.
“There is a lack of food, a lack of
water and a lack of medical

‘ supplies.”

The video, Iraq: The
Aftermath, was put together by a
German relief worker in April,
two months after the war ended,
and illustrated the effects of the
war, the sanctions and the civil
unrest on Iraq.

“l~Ie’s starving,” an Iraqi woman
in the video said, looking down
at her baby.

“Everything he cats or drinks
comes up again, and he has
diarrhea. He suffers from shiver
and fever attacks,” she said.

Castek, a member of PSIP, went
to Iraq injune as part ofthe Gulf
Peace Team, an international
relief grou p. One of the objectives
of the team was to figure out the
most efficient way to dispense
aid. ‘

Castek said she spent a lot of
time in hospitals talking to
workers and administrators about
their need for clean water and

cannabis hemp were the focus of a
discussion that drew 30 people to the first
meeting of Pitt’s chapter of Help End
Marijuana Prohibition, held yesterday in
the William Pitt Union.

Pitt junior and HEMP founder Dan
Waterman, who claims to have been arrested
twice in his fight to legalize pot, asserts that
“hemp was made illegal because of the
interests of people like the DuPonts  who
controlled the media and not because of
the drug’s consciouslnesslaltering effects.”

“T wenty-five percent of all prescription

drugs could be replaced by hemp,” said‘
Chrissy Matthews, who described the
potential uses of marijuana and its active
ingredient, THC, as a treatment for bronchial
disorders, epilepsy and stress.

Reference was also made to a TIIC
eyedrop used by President Bush for the
treatment of his glaucoma.

“I-Iemp was one of the first crops grown

by man  It had 10,000 uses,” said Duquesne

University student Matt Kelly.

“One of the reasons we fought the War
of I812 was because the British blockaded
the North Sea and, therefore, our supply of
hemp,” Kelly said.

“In [colonial] Virginia, landowners who
owned above a certain amount of land
were required to grow hemp under penalty
ofjail. Back then, you could pay your taxes
with it. George Washington, Thomas
Jefferson, all of these great men grew and
smoked hemp,” said Kelly. “They were all
a bunch of potheads.” _

I-IIZMP does more than hold informal_
meetings, according to group officers.

Last semester the organization clashed

with representatives from the Pittsburgh '

attorney’s office and the Drug [Enforcement

Agency in a televised debate mediated by

\X/I‘/\l’.’s Sally Wiggin, according to llI{MP

officers.
Last year, members of the group

‘ traveled to Florida to meet with

the Rainbow Family and attended
the Hash Bash, held in Michigan.

The group’s campus activities
include “hemp walks” and other
attention-getting activities, usually

. done in cooperation with other

pro—marijuana groups.

“At our last hemp walk, we
passed‘out over 100 joints,” said
Waterman, who said such actions

.aren’t very healthy for public

relations. .
_“You have to be empathetic
toward those who may not

understand,” Waterman said.

Waterman, who founded HEMP
after the nomadic, awareness-
raising Hemp Tour visited
Pittsburgh in 1990, believes that
marijuana is a misunderstood
drug.

“Fear of hemp is just a symptom
of the closed~mindedness so
prevalent in America today,” he
said.

Representatives from the
Pittsburgh chapter of the National
Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws were also in
attendance.

A mailing list and a “party list”
were also distributed.

fuel. _

“There were children that
were emaciated from
malnutrition and diarrhea,”
Castek said. “Their body systems
had shut down from a simple
lack of food.”

Castek also interviewed
families in the Al-Ameriya
neighborhood of Baghdad. A
shelter there was set ablaze’ on

' Feb. 13, they said. Army officials

claimed the bunker was a
telecommunications post for the
Iraqi forces, Castek said. Three
hundred and seventeen civilians

died in the attack, according
to the video.

Castek said the Iraqi families
were hospitable and friendly
during the extensive
interviews. “I went to people’s
homes, and what little food
they had was brought to us on
silver platters,” she said.

Castek also travelled on the
road leading from Kuwait City
to Basra. A few months earlier
coalition forces had relentlessly
bombed that road to prevent
Iraqi troops from ﬂeeing back
to their country. Castek
described the road as “earth

ripped apart.” ,

According to Castek, the Iraqi
people she met were asking,
“Why is America against us?
Why don’t they give us what we
need to sustain life? Why don’t
they lift these sanctions?”

Salwa Anoori, a Pitt graduate
and a native of Iraq, admitted
nothing can change what has
happened, but she hopes steps
still can be taken to prevent it
from recurring. She worries
that Iraq’s non—compliance with
U.N. security resolutions and
the subsequent U.S. threats will
lead to more bloodshed.

According to Dr. Janet Brigham,
a fellow in the psychology
department, passive smoke from
the burning end of a cigarette is
a major source for Environmental
Tobacco Smoke.

“ETS contains "measurable ‘A

amounts of nicotine and other

- toxic agents,” she said. Other

contributors of ETS include smoke
from factories and steel mills.

“Passive smoke effects a lot of
people,” Kuller said. “We worry
about all ages, from infants to the
elderly.”

He said a study was just

" completed on mothers who
smoke.

“If a mother smokes, her baby
will get the smoke by-products
through breast milk,” he said.

Brigham said 26 percent of the
US. population smokes, although
many smokers are quitting.

“Although the number of
smokers is dropping off
dramatically, there is still a strong
peer pressure to smoke,” she
said.

She said the number of young
smokers is increasing, especially
young women.- But Brigham

said that the more educated

smokers are, the less they’ll want
to smoke.

“Smoking is a complicated
behavior,” Brigham said. “It’s
more than an addiction. Smokers
smoke in particular situations that,
for example, are stressful. That’s

why relapse is so common for '

quitters.”

Kuller said that the drop in the
number of smokers is attributable
to smoking becoming an unsocial
habit. “There's been an increase
of public health concern and
awareness,” he said.

“Smokers who now cannot
smoke at work and in other public,
buildings are just stopping
altogether,” he said.

Although Kuller agrees with
non—smoking policies and does
not encourage smoking; he said
smoking should not be prohibited
because it would violate people’s
rights.

According to Deskins, CAS and
CGS classes that are cross-listed
generally have a smaller
enrollment. By combining these
classes, one professor can teach
a good-sized class, he said.

“Without cross—re'gistration,
neither school would have
enough students for a particular
class,” ‘Deskins said. “Cross-
registration allows both schools
to offer more courses.”

But some CGS «courses aren’t
generally offered to CAS students.
These “professional” courses,
such as Criminal Justice, are not
taught by the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, which provides
instruction for both CAS and CGS.
(CGS does not have its own
faculty.) Therefore these special
classes are targeted only for CGS
students.

Deskins also said that CGS

' classes are offered all over

Allegheny County, as well as
through the External Studies
Program. ,

CAS senior Stephanie Winseck

‘said she never had a problem

with cross-registration.
“I like to take a few night

classes because it fits my.

schedule," she said. “If it wasn't
for cross-registration, I wouldn’t
have been able to take a‘ lot of
“classes.”

According to Deskins, the CAS
Dean’s Ofﬁce has an unofficial
list of colleges and universities
that Pitt accepts credit from. “We

keep track of the qualiﬁcations of
other school's courses that we've
accepted from students in the
past,” he said.

Deskins said CAS and CGS cater
to different clienteles.

“The courses need to be tailored
for different groups of students,"
he said. “Economics is’ an
important factor which needs to
be considered when determining
whethera student will be admitted

to CAS or CGS.”
Deskins said that CAS students

are generally full-time and right '

out of high school, and CGS

students are usually olderland '

part-time.
A typical CGS class meets once

or twice a week in the evenings . A

or on Saturdays, he said, while
most CAS classes meet two or
three times a week during the
day".

Sophie’s plan kaput  

Mayor Sophie Masloff has rescinded her latest “brilliant”
plan to help the people of the ‘Burgh.

Two weeks ago Masloff announced the construction of
Clemente Field, a 44,000-seat, baseball—only stadium, to
be built on the North Side. The price of the field? One
hundred million to $130 million.

“Every once in a while I get carried away with an idea.

.I’-m not afraid to admit it,” the mayor told the Pittsburgh ‘

Press yesterday.

Although the mayor had good intentions, she admits
_that the timing of the announcement was inopportune,
since the city is in the middle of a fiscal crisis. True, the
stadium was not to be completed for another five to nine
years, but the necessity of such a field is also questionable.

City Council member Jim Ferlo opposed the plan. “I

. applaud the mayor for re—evaluating her position. The

notion of building a second stadium was ludicrous.”

Masloff believed that the stadium would keep the
Pirates in Pittsburgh, but many problems such as parking,
access and finances would have created more problems
than the construction would have solved.

The city and people of Pittsburgh do not need another
stadium. Even though Three Rivers Stadium does not
quite accommodate the Pirates and their amount of fans,
taxpayers cannot afford to see more of their money
wasted.

Boy Scout discrimination

Just as the Department of Defense has banned
homosexual members and leaders from its organization,
the Boy Scouts of America announced last Friday that it,
too, will reiect homosexuals.

The BSA also bars membership by atheists and women.

The San Francisco School Board said lastAugust that the
Boy Scout program had ‘to develop written policies
barring discrimination within their organization. This
request was ignored by the BSA.

According to USA Today, BSA spokesperson Blake
Lewis said, “Homosexuality is inconsistent with the Scout
oath of being morally straight.” ’

It isn’t as if discrimination against gays‘ isn't pathetic '

enough, but the fact that a developmental organization
may be inﬂuencing children to dislike a group of people
before they are mature enough to make their own choices
is even more unnerving.
‘ Andrew Humm, a member of the N ewYork Commission
on Human Rights, told USA Today that “discrimination
should be made as difficult for people as possible.”
Children should not be taught at such an early age, or
at any age for that matter, that homosexuality is wrong.

The BSA’s advocation of discrimination will only add to
confusion for these kids who are not yet old enough to
understand the wrongful hate handed down to people
who have a different sexual orientation.

Debate about House Bill 1075, which, would
bring Pitt under the state’s Right-to-Know Law, is
being clouded by confusion about what the bill
would actually do. / " ,

The bill itself, introduced in April by Rep. Ron
Cowell, chair of the House Education Committee,

Cowell Bill would not jeopardize research

immunities, duties or obligations of any person or
group of persons.”

The law also provides for certain exceptions,
designed to protect investigations, documents
otherwise protected by law and information the
publicationgof which would be damaging to “a

and passed overwhelmingly by
the House injune, is-quite simple.

amends the 1957 Right-to-Know
Law to bring explicitly within the
law’s definition. of “agency” the

Philip K.

person’s reputation or personal
security” or “would result in the
loss  of Federal funds.”

The extensive history of
the application of the Right-to-
Know Law shows that in practice

four state-related universities (Pitt,
Penn State, Temple and Lincoln), the 14 state-

owned universities and the community colleges. As

passed by the House, it also includes “state-aided”

private institutions, which receive relatively small

amounts of state funding.

The Right-to-Know Law simply requires every
state agency to open its “public records” to
examination, inspection and copying by “any citizen
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania." Its purpose
is thus not to make information available to the
legislature but to make it available to the public.

The concerns expressed at Monday’s Senate
Council meeting by President J. Dennis O’Connor,"
Dr. Thomas Detre and some others relate to the
nature of the information the public would have a
right to know. The law quite clearly addresses
records of ﬁnancial and other business dealings of
an agency, not all of its activities in an “omnibus”
fashion, as President O’Connor fears.

The results of sensitive negotiations such as those
sketched by Detre would only be covered after
completion of the deal, and Detre himself indicated
he had no problem with disclosure at that point.

“Public record" is defined in the law as “any
account, voucher or contract dealing with the
receipt or disbursement of funds by an agency or
its acquisition, use or disposal of services or of
supplies, materials, equipment or other property
and any_minute, order or decision by an agency
fixing the personal or property rights, privileges,

Wion

it has worked well. The courts
have been scrupulous in limiting disclosure to the
kinds of business dealings speciﬁed.

Public schools, the state-owned universities and
the community colleges have lived‘ under the law
without difﬁculty. , h

The state-relateds are exempt only because of a
1973 case in which the administration at Temple
argued that it should not be considered a state
“agency” under the law. In 1990 a similar ruling
prevented students from gaining access to financial
data at Penn State.

Interestingly, when the Sunshine Law was enacted
in 1986, the legislature was careful to include “the
boards of trustees of all state-related universities” in
its definition of “agency.” I

The fundamental issue in dispute, therefore,
concerns the legal identity of Pitt and the other
state-related universities. Those who oppose the
bill believe that these institutions should continue

‘to be Considered “private” with respect to the Right-

to-Know Law and should be allowed to conceal
from the public whatever business dealings they
deem “confidential.” Those who favor the bill

believe that universities which receive major funding 
from the state should be considered public agencies

and should be accountable to the public which
supports them. ‘

Philip K. Wion is president of the United Faculty
of the University of Pittsburgh.

period to help lead Canada to a 4-2 victory
over Team USA for the 1991 Canada Cup
championship Monday night at the Copps
Coliseum in Hamilton, Ont. I

The goal by Larmer, his 6th of the
tournament, came while Canada was
shorthanded, due to a roughing penalty
by defensemansteve Smith. Dirk Graham
dashed the United States’ hopes of another
comeback when he added an empty—net
insurance goal with less than a minute to
play. Canada won the best-of-three ﬁnal

2-0.

In the ﬁrst period, Canada jumped out
to a 2-0 lead on goals by Mark Messier and
Steve Larmer just 20 seconds apart. The
United States stormed back in a crisply
played second period, tying the game on
goals by Jeremy Roenick and Kevin Miller.

Miller’s goal was to be the last for the

Americans, who were looking to stave off
elimination by defeating the Canadians
for the first time in Canada Cup history. An

American victory would have forced a .

third and ﬁnal game Wednesday night.

‘Canada had won the ﬁrst game of the
series 4-1. ,

Canada goaltender Bill Ranford was
named the tournament’s Most Valuable
Player for his outstanding play. Wayne
Gretzky, despite missing the final series

with a back injury, ledall scorers with four
goals and eight assists for 12 points.
The victory for Canada was their fourth
such win in the tournament’s history,
which started in 1976 and is now played
every four years. The Canadians, manned
with NHL all—star talents Wayne Gretzky
and Mark Messier and future-NHL star Eric
Lindros, were undoubtedly the strongest
team entering the tournament and were
the odds-on favorite to repeat as Canada
Cup champions. I
The road to the ﬁnals was not an easy
one for the United States to travel. On the
eve of the tournament, Team USA was hit
with the news that head coach Bobjohnson
would have to undergo surgery to remove
a tumor from his brain. Assistant coach
Tim Taylor was named as the head coach

in Johnson’s absence.

Team USA shook off the pre-tournament".

Casual observer's complete scoring guide to tennis

fifth points, then the eighth. and -

By Joe Foner
For The Pitt News

All right, you’ve just finished V

watching the‘ US. Open, and,
like many casual tennis observers
who just started watching the
game, you didn’tunderstand what
was going on during all the
excitement. Don’t worry, here’s a
rundown on how to score a tennis
match.

The basics of serving and what’s
in and out aside, we’ll start with
how to score a game.‘

- Points go like this: The ﬁrst
point is 15 (some people use
ﬁve), then 30, then 40, then game.

If you want to announce the

score, zero is pronounced “love.”
So, 40-0 would be
pronounced,”forty-love.” If you
win a game without giving up
any points, it’s called a “love
game.”

You have to be up by at least
two points to win; if the score
gets to 40-40, it’s called deuce.

At deuce, you have to win two
points (or more) in a row to win.
If you win the ﬁrst point after
deuce and lose the next one, the

I score goes back to deuce.

Notice that if you lose the ﬁrst
point after deuce, you would
have to win the next three‘ in a

row to win the game.

The score also goes back to
deuce if you win the ﬁrst point
after deuce and lose the next
point. *

For example, if Player A and
Player B were at deuce, and
Player A won the ﬁrst point, the
score would be “Advantage:
Player A.”

If Player A wins the next point,
he wins the game; if not, the
score goes back to deuce, and
somebody has to win two points
in a row to win the game.

Next we’1l cover sets. It takes
six games to win a set, but you
also have to win a set by two

games (6-4, for instance).

If both players win five games,
one player must win a seventh
game to win the set. If the score
gets to 6-6, then the set goes into
a tie break. -.

A tie break goes to seven points,
but this you also have to win, by
two, like 8-6 or 9-7, if things get
that far. (Notice a pattern
forming?)

Tie breaks aren’t run like normal
games, however.

One player serves the ﬁrst point,
and then the players alternate
serve every two points.

So, a player might serve the
first point, then the fourth and

ninth points and so on. ,

Players change sides every six .

points. The player who wins the
tie break wins the set.

I hope this clears up the mess I p 
we know as tennis scoring, so 

next time you won’t get cheated

when you play; Or the next time If

you're watching on the tube,
you’ll know what’s going on.

If you have any questions or
anything to add, let me knowat

the topic and I'll get back to you."

Huskies vs ’Huskers
top collegiate picks

By Brian Berger

and Rob Pugliese
T be Pitt News

Schoolboys Two continue to
make major grades, as we scored
all A’s last weekend by
manipulating the lines like Errict
Rhett slicing through the once-
proud ‘Bama defense. We went
4-0 on Saturday, including the
Pitt rout, to boost our impressive
season mark to a sweet 8-1 (10-
1 if you in.clude the Pitt games).

The theme this week is colors,
as we continue our ride on the
orange and blue Gainesville
Gator, swimmingnorth to orange
and blue country of a different
color. Ride the rhythm.

(-9) Florida Gators (2-0) at
Syracuse Orangemen (2-0), ABC,
12 pm., Saturday.

Saturday night the f1fth—ranked
Gators of Florida served an all-
points bulletin that they’re
definitely in the house as far as
the National Championship race
is concerned. Steve Spurrier’s
defense rocked Alabama in the
first half, while Heisman

candidate Shane Matthews and
the “fun—and—gun” offense
cranked it up in the second half
in a 35-0 rampage over the
Crimson Tide. The Gators looked
tougher than any ofthe “experts,”
save us, imagined.

Often overshadowed by
quarterback Matthews, the Florida
running game amassed 216 yards
against one ofthe top defenses in
the nation. Rhettwaxed the ‘Bama
defense like Rain Dance for a
whopping 170 yards and thrust
himself into the Heisman race.
Ace receiver Tre Everett caught
five passes for 97 yards and a
touchdown, and sophomore
Willie Jackson was on the

‘ receiving end of two more

Matthews touchdowns. Matthews
started slowly, but still finished

‘with 15 completions in 27

attempts for 251 yards.

The real deal for the Gators
was their defense, which
completely stymied the Tide
offense, which granted isn’t that
impressive. But the way in which
I-‘lorida swamped the Tide was

awesome: 45 carries for 14 rushing
yards, 99 yards passing with a
mere 9 completions and a
knocked—out quarterback named
Danny Woodson. Good news for
the Tide, though; they don’t face
Florida for another seven years,
thanks to the new SEC
realignment.

Too bad for Syracuse, however,
who draw the formidable task of
stopping the Gator machine.

The ‘Cuse come in undefeated,
with victories over Vanderbilt and
Maryland. Not too tough. On
Saturday a mediocre Maryland
squad pushed the now~17th-
ranked Orange to the limit. Highly
rated sophomore quarterback
Marvin Graves threw for 251
yards, and tailback David Walker
ran for 92 yards on 14 trips. The
“Rocket’s” younger brother, “the
Missile” Qadry Ismail, caught six
balls for 141 yards, but all this
offense was good for only two
touchdowns, as the Terrapin
“bend—but—don’t—break” defense
kept the game close. I t
wasn’t until an interception in

the endzone anda 61-yard punt
return by Shelby Hill that Syracuse
took over. So you might say the
‘Cuse couldn’t find the end zone,
but their special teams and defense
made up for the rest.

The Orange offense is built on
the “speed kills” theme, with
burners like Graves, Walker, Hill
and the “Missile,” but Florida’s
speed on defense is horrifying.
Linebackers Tim Paulk and
Ephesians Bartley will make it a
long day for Graves, while
cornerback Del Speer and all-
American safety Will White will
have no problem shutting down
the big plays. Syracuse’s defense
is looking down the barrel of an
automatic weapon. Matthews,
Rhett, Everett and Harrison
Houston will smoke the Syracuse
defense. If the Gators establish
the running game early, look out.
Matthews will show patience early
but light it up later. In the Dome,
Florida does what it’s famous for
— freshly squeezed orange juice.
Take Florida -9.

West Virginia Mountaineers (2-

1) at (-2) Maryland Terrapins (1— W

1).

The Mountaineers, rejuvenated
by the return of QB Darren
Studstill, squeaked by a weak
South Carolina Gamecock squad
21-16, despite being two-point
‘dogs at home and having no
crowd support to speak of. WVU
came out fired up and built up a
21-0 bulge at the half, only to
relapse into typical Mountaineer
football in the second half. The
Gamecocks effectively shut down
Mountie tailback Adrian Murrell,
holding him to 66 yards, but
Studstill alone was enough to
pull this one out. In his first
action since being injured against
Pitt, he accounted for 226' yards
total offense, picking up 50 yards
on 12 carries, while completing
15 of 24 passes for 176 yards and
one touchdown. The WVU
defense didn’t impress, however,
yielding‘ 315 ‘ yards to the

‘ Gamecocks.

Maryland battled the Syracuse
Orangemen for three quarters
before succumbing to the depth
and talent of the ‘Cuse 31-17.

valiantly, the Swedes would bow
out to the eventual champions
one game short of the ﬁnal.

The biggest surprise of the
tournament was turned in by
Finland. The Finns, having won
only one Canada Cup game in
three appearances, were expected
to occupy the cellar once again.

Finland, with Christian Ruutu,
Esa Tikkanen andjari Kurri at the
helm, shocked hockey fans by
qualifying for the semi-finals for
the first time ever. ’

The biggest disappointment of

the tournament had to be turned ‘

in by the Soviet and
Czechoslovakian teams. 4
The Czechs, with NHL

standouts Jiri Latal, Petr Klima
and Jaromir Jagr, were expected
by hockey experts to make a run
for the semi-finals but fell short of
those expectations.

A perennial powerhouse, the
Soviet team turned out to be the
biggest bust of the tournament.
The Canada Cup was supposed
to be a chance for them to ﬂex

 

their muscles before the 1992
Winter Olympics, but it was
obvious from the start of the
tournament that the “Big Red
Machine” was in need of repair.

The Soviets, who forced
Canada to the brink of
elimination in the 1987 Canada
Cup, failed to qualify for the
semi—ﬁnals for the first time in
the tournament’s history.

The Soviets are the only team
other than Canada to win the
tournament, doing so in 1981.

yards and an interception before
being pulled in favor of backup

John Kaleo. Bad move. Kaleo'

horrendous 8-for— 1 9 performance.

The only positive for the
Terrapin offense was tailback
Mark Mason, who rambled for 96
yards on 10 carries, including a

West Virginia’s offense has
improved from terrible to just

the corn— or maize-huskers.
Let’s start with Nebraska, who
has looked dominant in their first
two outings this season. Granted
the Huskers played Utah State
(quick, what’s their nickname?)
and Colorado State, but they ran
it up big, winning by a combined
130-52. The Cornboys have
racked up an amazing 1,100+

sophomore sensation Derek

R both games, but this is different.

Joseph is a dazzling runner but

are as big as the cornstalks and
will keep Joseph protected.
Nebraska has unbelievable depth
in the backfield. Leodis Flowers
rushed for 940 yards last season
but somehow has been dropped
to fourth string. -

On defense the Huskers lost
six starters, including Bruce
Pickens, Mike Croel‘ and Kenny
Walker, so vwho knows? They
gave up 28 points to Utah State,
a team not even in most college
previews. Linebackers Travis Hill
and Mike Petko make the defense
go, but where they go has yet to
be seen. Two home games against

S lesser opponents is not a test.

One note about the Huskers:
They have yet to punt all year,

The Fox 40 whistle is sonically designed to producea high pitch “trill” which is more intense than
traditional whistles. This whistle is not a toy! This whistle has been designed for use as a deterrent
to crime and is also effective as a signalling device in accident situations.

versus the Cardinal, including a
touchdown strike to his favorite
target, split end Mario Bailey.
Bailey and flanker Orlando
McKay form one of the nation’s
finest receiving tandems,
something the ‘Huskers don’t get
to see too often. Tailback Beno
Bryant has yet to carry the ball in
’9l, missing the first game with
an injury. His status is probable
for Saturday.

The Huskies are mean on
defense. The “Purple Haze”
allowed only 66.8 yards on the
ground last year, tops in the
nation by far. All-American tackle
Steve‘ Emtman (6-4, 285) is
possibly the best lineman in the
country. He is complemented
by a corps of linebackers that
can play with anyone. This
defense takes no prisoners.

The Washington defense
should control the line, due to
Emtman and those mean
‘backers. Nebraska has a history
of being way up or way down in
these big games, while
Washington is always solid. To
beat the Huskies, you must
outplay them; they won’t give
you anything.

Once Nebraska realizes that
they can’t run on these guys, it’ll
be panic time in Lincoln. We’re
cocky about this pick; we intend
on leaving September with only
one loss on our record. Look for
the “Haze” to smother the 9th-
ranked ‘Huskers. In our pick of

Vegetarianism
Chosen lifestyle

for the health

Conscious

By Katie Ann Karninski
For T be Pitt News

What do Paul McCartney, Peter
Gabriel and Mr. Rogers have in
common?

Theyare all vegetarians.

Even Albert Einstein was a
vegetarian. If you have also given
up meat for lettuce, broccoli and
carrots, you are one of over an
estimated 2 billion vegetarians in
the worldltoday.

Vegetarianism became a fad in
the late ’70s and early ’80s, when
socially conscious Americans
gasped at the process of meat
production.

This process cultivates grain
speciﬁcally for animals. Once fed
and bulked up, the animals are
slaughtered to produce meat.

Eating only grains, fruits and
vegetables, vegan-vegetarians are
the most strict group of
vegetarians. But not all
vegetarians follow such a rigid
meal plan.

Lacto-vegetarians include dairy
products in their meals, and lacto-
o_vo-vegetarians add eggs.

Most vegetarians modify the
vegetarian diet to their own tastes;
for example, semi-vegetarians
only eliminate red meat.

Today, an increasing number
of Americans are adopting a
vegetarian lifestyle.

_ They want “to trim fat and
cholesterol from their diets by
foregoing meat for vegetarian fare.
In a world of calorie-laden, super-
processed foods, vegetarian diets
can be very healthy.

There are many benefits to
becoming a vegetarian, according
to Dr. Barbara Deskins, an
in the
department of clinical dietetics
and nutrition at Pitt.

Lower blood pressure and
lower blood-cholesterol levels are
a direct result of the elimination
of meat from the diet, Deskins
said. This reduces the vegetarian’s
chance of getting heart disease.

A low-meat, high—grain, high-
fiber diet also gives vegetarians a
lower r/ate of some forms of
cancer, ‘especially colon cancer,
she said.

Deskins said a vegetarian diet
is recommended for those who
are at high risk of heart disease
and cancer.

_ A purely plant-food diet can
provide most of the nutrients the
human body needs, she said.
Many people think protein can’t
-be obtained in the diet without
eating meat, but this belief has
been discredited.

Protein is available in plant
foods, such as dried peas and
beans. Vegetarians, however,
may choose to supplement their
diets with nutrients such as
Vitamin B12 and iron, which are
difficult to obtain without eating
meat.
