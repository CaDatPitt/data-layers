Rumors conﬁrmed: Pitt
joins new conference

Patriot League tvelcomes Panthers

' _Kyle Craig
F0’ The Pitt News

(4

The Internet rumors and_un-
bridled speculation can ﬁnally be
put to rest. . ’

Tomorrow, the Pitt Athletic De-
partment will oﬂicially announce
that the Panthers will indeed move
to a new conference: the Patriot
League.

“We’re very excited-about this
move,” Steve Pederson, Pitt ath-
letic director,vsaid in a statement
released to the media. .

“The switch to the Patriot
League will secure the future-of
Pitt athletics from a ﬁnancial_and
competitive perspective for the
‘years to come.” Departingthe Big
East for the Patriot League might
surprise some fans, especially
considering that it will demote the
Panther football team to the Foot-
ball Championship Subdivision.
‘Despite’ this monumental sacriﬁce,

_ both Pederson and football head

coach Dave Wannstedt were able to
put a positive spin on the change.

“People have been complaining
about Pitt not having an intrastate

rival in football for years. Now, we
have three of them in the same
conference,” Pederson said. Ped-
erson referred to Bucknell, Lafay-
ette and Lehigh — a trio of schools
that will have to ﬁll the void, now
that contests against West Virginia
seem unlikely. V
Ironically, now that Pitt is an
FCS school, Penn State has jumped
at the opportunity of scheduling
the Panthers. According to sources
inside the athletic department, the
current offer from the Penn State
administration requests 12 games
to be played in Happy Valley with
the possibility of a_13th game be-
ing played in either Pittsburgh or
Philadelphia. ' 

t The conference switch also puts .
Pitt’s attempts to improve football

game attendance into perspective.
Compared to some of the teams in
the Patriot League,Pitt football is
a bigger draw than Bonjovi.
“After taking a- look around,
I’m very happy with all of our at-
tendance ﬁgures,” Pederson said.

Dixon prepares resumes  

Patriot League < 1

doesn’t even:have a real name.”

A few months ago Pitt basket-
ball coach Jamie Dixon said that
any move out of the Big East would
be a downgrade for the basketball
program. Dixon stepped away from
his comments yesterday at the
Oakland FedEx Kinkos.

“I think we’re going to be very
successful in the Patriot League,”
Dixon said while picking up a
bundle of resumés. “What am I
doing here? Well, you should‘ al-
ways keep your resumé updated,
just in case.” .

What makes the move puzzling
for some Pitt followers is the fact
that the Big Ten has been actively

entertaining the thought of expan— .

sion. Recent comments from _the '
Big Ten administration indicate
that the conference is looking to
add 19 teams to become the coun-
.try’s ﬁrst ultra—conference.
Joining the prospective 30-
team league would have main-
tained Pitt’s position in national
relevance. Instead, Pitt has gone
in a different direction, and now
football games with‘Holy Cross
and Colgate are on the horizon.

Pitt football coach Dave Wannstedt discusses the switch to the Patriot
League at a press conference late last night.

Semicolon used correctly

Dave Beitzel
Rogue Agent

After a conscious-shattering use of
a semicolon, Pitt freshman Arthur
Homer was awarded an honorary
doctorate in English literature. In
an otherwise ordinary term paper,
Homer placed a semicolon between
two similar but distinct thoughts,
single-handedly staging a literary
revolution capable of reducing grown
men to tears. ‘
Department professor Magnus
Oatshire, who bore witness to this
grammatical orgasm, described his
reaction: “Initially, I was paralyzed.
Then I wept for hours, helpless. I
thought I was suckling at the quill of
Albert Camus.” Coweringinthe glory
of such chilling punctuation, Oatshire
immediately contacted Chancellor

Mark Nordenberg to alert him of a I

coming wave.

“I said, ‘Get ready,_ man, because
your world’s about to change,”’ Oat-
shire said, referring to inevitable pub-

 

licity once word of this rare beast’s
achievements got out.

village to village in song and verse.

When asked how he birthed the

Pitt cuts liberal arts programs

Liberal arts students eloquently express disgust

Eric Shannon
Oakland Bureau Chief

Inamove that is sending shockwaves
through academia, Pitt has become
the ﬁrst school in the nation to do
away with all of its liberal arts pro-
grams.

Citing a changing economy and
the need for massive budget cuts, Pitt
has announced that it will no longer
offer non—technical degrees._ _

A Pitt spokesmanjohn Ferrari said
that though Pitt offers a world- class
education in its non—technical de-

‘ grees, the recession has proved that _
such degrees in English literature or .

Slavic studies are of sig-
niﬁcance in today’s job market.
“We had to look really hard at
where the economy was headed and
felt that it was not only irresponsible
to continue to offer degrees that did
not prepare students for any sort
employment, but that it was uncon-
scionable to withhold ﬁmdingforthe
science- and technology-_bas_edAde-

grees thatwillyield ﬁnancial success I

to continue to pour money into more
antiquated disciplines,” he said.

Many students currently working
toward a degree in a liberal arts dis-
cipline responded with anger. Some
withdrew from Pitt.

’ Junior Antoinette Krebbes, who
had been pursuing a degree in so-
ciology with a_ minor in women’s
studies, said the decision signals a

‘ far—reach_ing societal conspiracy.

“Science-heavy ﬁelds tend to be
dominated by men, so it’s no surprise
that the University would favor the
degrees that perpetuate the culture
of a patriarchal corporatocracy,”
Krebbes said. “So I guess I’ll have to
start bartending  man, this is such
crap.” ‘

For some faculty members, such

as Karl Lambert, who holds a doctor- -

ate in 17th'century British literature,
the news is even more crushing.
“The World is grown so bad, that
Wrens make prey where eagles dare
not perch!” Lambert said, drinking
from aﬂask. “My brother in Boulder"
said that ‘he’d get me a job with his
landscaping business.” _
Though the decisionis seemingly
unfair, ‘signiﬁcant data supports the

. idea that a non—tech_nical education

is nolonger feasible, Carol Finland,

director of the Office of Career Ser-
vices, said.

“We keep track of students that
get placed in jobs after graduation,

and of all the liberal arts majors in

the class of 2009, exactly two have
gotten jobs,” Finland said.

The detailed report identiﬁed that
only journalism major Lyle Freder-

ickson and art history major Kelly,

Brouwerwere able to secure jobs in
the year since graduation. -
Frederickson was hired as an obit-
uary writer for the Sheboygan Daily
Sun where his uncle is the editor, and
Brouwer was able to secure a job as a
receptionist at alocal museum, which

Finland attributed solely to her “con— _

siderable attractiveness.”

Finland’s advice to students who
are still a year or two from gradua-
tion was to switch majors to a ﬁeld
that relies heavily on math or com-
puting. For students graduating in
April, her advice was much more

‘ disparaging. .

“From the data we’ve seen, it’s
clear that the American economy
no longer has any place for creative
thought or humanity. God have mer-
cy on your souls.”

Lady Gaga secret Pitt senior

' Something, alright

Despite the elaborate costumes and
distancing persona, Pitt students are
closer to Lady Gaga than they might
think.

Dolores Carmichael has revealed that
she is, in fact, the real Lady Gaga.

“I feel like it’sﬂnallytimetoletpeo-

said. ‘At my concert inMelboume last

The confession might come as a
shock to those fans who believed 23-

realGaga, and Carmichael said she un- ‘

derstands the mix of anger and confu-

Rainbow Alliance

holds event for ‘Allies’

Eric Shannon
Staﬁ’ Writer

RainbowAlliance hopes to not only make it easier
for people to come out, but for those students’
friends and family to support them.

Pitt’s Rainb0wAlliance held itsﬁrstProud to be
an Ally event Wednesday night at Posvar Hall.

They directed the event at the allied, people
who support those inthe LGB'I‘Q community, and
gave them a chance to speak abouttheir experi-
ences. People could also speak about how support
from an ally friend helped them make their deci-
sionto come out. '

“It’s not just straight people, but anybody even
within the community that gives their support,”
Rainbow Alliance Vice President Julia Wester
said. A - E « .

James Weaver, president ofPitt’s RainbowAlli—

ance,saidthisistheﬁrsteventti1eyhavesponsored I

‘Speak Out where people could talk about their

experiences of coming out, he said. The Alliance
decided that this term they could have an event
thatfocused on the people that give their support
to the community, the president said.

’ Theﬁrstfewspeakers signeduptosharetheir

stories to the 2_6-person crowd, but as the night .

wenton, manymore stoodupto give theirstories.
Though the stories were often diverse, many Sill-

ggdents recalledtimeswhentheirfriends andfamily
. gave help and support

“My senior year of high school, I planned to
gotothe promwith myboyfriend, except he lived
morethantwo hours away,” studentAdamDobson
said. “But ourfriends pulledtogether, takingturns
drivingalong the wayto get meta the prorn,and

we ended up beingthe ﬁrst gay couple ever at his _

schools prom.” _
However, many straight allies, such as Domi-
nique Dabecco, also recalled how important the
LGBTQ members in their lives are.

“IfIweren’tanally,Iwouldn’thaveanyfrien I ,”

- Dabeccosaidjol<ingly‘Allofmylife,I’vebeensLir-

rounded by people in my family and my friends

that are gay-”

Some had an especially solemntone, such as
Gillian Schuyler’s story about howabeloved family
friend died of AIDS from a heroin addiction alter
facing a lack of support from those around him.

I “I kr1ewI had to be an ally, I decided Iwould
never let my generation make the same mistakes
that led to [my ﬁiend]’s death,” Schuyler said.

Sociology professor Suzanna Crage said sup-
portis crucialfor LGB’I‘Q individuals who struggle
with the thought of coming out.

“For manypeople, coming outthreatens every
relationship, because they don’t know how their
family orfriendswillreact,” Crage said. “You don’t
have to lookatvery deep into our culture to see that
sometimes those fears aren’t entirely irrational.”

Crage referred Ricky Martin’s recent coming
out as an especially pertinent example.

His statement, according to the Huﬂington

' Post, read:

“Many people told me: ‘Ricky it’s not impor-
tant,’ ‘it’s notworth it,’ ‘all the years you’veworked
and everything you’ve built will collapse,’ ‘many
people in the world are not ready to accept your
truth,yourreality,yournatJ1re.’ Becauseallthisad-

Crage saidthisisanexample ofhowimportant _ .

otherpeople’s opinions canbeforpeople consider-
ing coming out.

“It’s somewhat different because Martin is a
celebrity and worries of public opinion do play a
part, butitunderscores how importantthe opinion

Crage recalled the origins of pride week, and
theﬁrstgaypride parades. V

“Whatwas brilliantwiththe idea ofthe parade
was that it allowed people to show that therewas
a community and an atmosphere of acceptance.

Professor wins fellowship, enjoys flamenco

Mechanical engineering professor Peyman Givi explains his hobbies and research.

Richard Rosengarten
Staff Writer

‘ For Peyman Givi, the honor of being a fellow

is just another feather in his cap '— he has
quite a few already. V .

Givi, a mechanical engineering professor,
received a fellowship at the American Insti-
tute for Astronautics and Aeronautics. The
institute chose him, among 30 other fellows
worldwide. He was chosen for his “pioneering

_ contributions” in mathematical modeling

and computational simulation of turbulent
combustion, according to a University news

‘ release. The institute will honor him for the ‘
award in May at the Spotlight Awards Gala

in Washington, D.C.
Born in Tehran, Iran, Givi attended
Youngstown State University in Ohio. He

joined Pitt’s mechanical engineering staff

in 2002.
Givi also works with NASA, mostly at the

A Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va.,

and in 2005 received NASA’s Distinguished
Public Service Medal for developing math-
ematical methodology for the calculation
of high-speed reacting ﬂows. The medal is
the highest honor NASA awards nongovern-
mental ofﬁcials. _ .

He jésted that his good looks didn’t hurt

his chances at getting the medal.
“A lot of people get nominated,” Givi said.
“I think I was lucky that I got it.” I
Givi, who ﬁnished his doctorate at Carn-
egie.Me1lon, is known for the development
of computational, mathematical methodol-

' ogy for engine design. That means he stud-

ies engine turbulence. and ﬂow and creates
computer models of engines, which can be
tested in simulation. '

He and others with him have developed

In developing computational methodolo- A

to the methodology — don’t have to actually

build something before ﬁnding out it doesn’t -

A‘Dating Game’ to
help prevent assault

Lindsay Carroll
Assistant News Editor

The DatingGame, once afavorite television showin'

the ’60s and "705, now might help prevent rape.
SexualAssault Services, apart ofthe University
Counseling Centergwillhostan eventtonightusing
the classic television show as a model forbuilding
healthy relationships. The eventwill be held in121
David Lawrence Hall at 7 p.‘m.
It’s theﬁrsteverDating Game sponsoredbythe

department for its annual Sexual Assault Aware~ ,

ness Week, MaryRuiz, coordinator ofthe program,
said. Ruiz said she and some colleagues came up
with the ideafor the game. ‘

Student Government Board President Charlie
Shull, Panhellenic Council President Nicole Cioﬁi
and basketball player Chase Adams will be con-
testants on the show. Students who participate
in the gamecould win a free dinner for two —
although they won’t have to go on a date with the
contestants.

The questionswilltryto demonstrate healthy
communication and relationships. Ruiz wanted
the event to demonstrate how to build healthy
communication between two individuals —— as a

' lack of which serves as one of the main causes of

sexual assault.

“We’re promoting assertive communication
infriendships, relationships and interpersonal
interactions,” Ruiz said. ,

Ruiz said she thinks it’s more difﬁcult to build
healthy relationships incollegethan in other situ-
ations, but notimpossible. Partofthe problemis a
culture ofhookingup rat:herthanda1ing, she said.
Dating means a relationship is built on getting to
know a person before having sexual relations,,
and she hopes the Datin'gGamewi]lpromote that
kind of relationship. '

‘A good relationship isn’tbuilt on sex, it’s built

on gettingto know one another and respect one ‘

another,” shesaid. .

Contrary to popular belief, sexual assault and
rape don’tfrequently happenbetween strangers.
Mostsexualassaultoccurswithsomeone avictim
knows, Ruiz said.

One reason for this is that physical evidence
can be ditﬁcult to collect in situations where the
victim and perpetrator know each other, but also,
“Society doesn’t want to believe  that the nice
young man next door is capable of sexually as
saulting or raping,” she said.

Educating students about being assertive and
the importance of not making assumptions will
help prevent sexual assault and confusion about

consent, she said. And that responsibility falls on.

both men and women, who are both vulnerable
to sexual assault, she said.

Although Ruiz said she hasn’t yet compiled
statistics forthisyear, and lastyear’s weren’t read-
ily available, the majority of sexual assaults occur
oﬁlcampus and have female victims. Alcohol is
involved in most cases, she said.

“Women need to be more aware ofhow much
theydrink— and men also do,” she said. Women
become morevulnerable and menare“more likely
to do somethingtheywouldn’t normally do’ ’under

« the inﬂuence of alcohol, Ruiz said.

SexL1alAssault Services provides individual and
group counselingfor male and female students, as
well as medical, legal and police support, accord-
ing to the program’s website. Issues the program
confronts include dating violence, sexual assault,
harrassment and stalking, Ruiz said.

“The purpose of sexualassault awareness and
all the events that take place throughout the year
is to get the message across that sexual assault is
an issue that needstobe confronted by both men
and women,” Ruiz said. _ .

The only way that can happen is with respect
and good communication, she said. To prevent
sexual assault, Ruiz gave the following sugges-
tions: - .

— — —Know yourself. That makes it easier to say
no. ' -T -
—-Be assertive.

——‘Know your limits with alcohol, and stick
to them. '

—-Help your friends. This means looking out
for your friends who could be victims as well as
perpetrators.

refresher in the world of mechani-
cal engineering.

“Especially beingin the engi-

. neering department, it’s easy to fall

into the nerdy mold,” Pisciuneri
said. “[Givi] deﬁnitely doesn’t ﬁt
that.” V

Givi plays ﬂamenco and classical
guitar. He said it resonates with tra-
ditional Persian music. His website

. links to many artists like Santana,

the Monkees and the soloistjames
Piorkowski.
When he is not debugging code

or plucking nylon strings, Givi A

might be riding the hills of Pitts-
burgh on his Honda Shadow 600
motorcycle (a purchase based not
at all on his .computational knowl-

edge of enginemechanics, he em- “’

phasized).

Givi also appreciates the Per-
sian and Iranian culture here at Pitt.
While he would like to see more of
it, he appreciates student activ-
ity like last month’s celebration of

' the Persian New Year. He’s excited

about the new Persian restaurant,

Shiraz, that recently opened on
Centre Avenue.

Even though he got his Ph.D. at
Carnegie Mellon University, Givi
said he had no intention of work-

with Pitt’s campus and is glad to be

with Esteghlal, the Persian sports
club and soccer team in Tehran, he
loves Pittsburgh sports. .

Additionally, Givi aims to bring
his methodology to “mom and pop”

just major industries can take ad-

saving practices. -

He’d like to be ableto play the
guitar like Paco DeLucio as well,
when he ﬁnds the time.

.‘He really treats the students '

Givi values hard work and pas-
sion under his kind demeanor. He
looks for those qualities when ac-

" cepting and working with Ph.D. stu-

dents, he says, rather than relying
solely on grades and test scores.

“I think that the most important
[judge of character] is to meet with
the students, talk with them, work
with them and to see what they have

Heed needed
planning Plaza
Eat’n Park

itt students and members
P of the Oakland community

could have a new restau-
rant to choose from in the future,
but it would be constructed in a
prominent location: Schenley
Plaza. ’

The Eat’n Park Hospital-
ity group will potentially build
a restaurant in Schenley Plaza,
although the timeframe has yet
to be ﬁnalized. Fortunately, the

restaurant is ‘supposed to be 10- '

cated on the smaller plot of grass
across from the Hillman Library
— the main plot, often sprinkled
with sunbathing students in the
warmer months, should be -left
undisturbed. ‘
Pitt’s campus is largely consid-
ered an urban campus. But there
are a few patches of green on the
campus and in the surrounding
area to provide a campus-y feeling
amid trafﬁc—stricken roads and
rows of buildings. Save the plant-
ed trees speckling the area, there
isn’t much green to go around:
The lawn outside Soldiers and
Sailors and the lawns surround-
ing the Cathedral and Schenley
Plaza comprise the only semi-

, spacious nearby sites. While the

potential restaurant would cover
up the smaller of the two lawns
in Schenley Plaza, preservation
of the larger, “emerald lawn” is
key. ' ‘

Such a new restaurant could
bring in more business to Oakland
— or keep it from leaving — and
will surely attract more people
to the plaza. Hopefully, though,
the bustle of the restaurant --
especially if the project includes
a takeout section — won’t dis-
rupt the laidback character of the
plaza as a place for students to
relax. Schenley Plaza is a mere ﬁve

acres, so it’s possible it could get
quite crowded. Although students

. can hike over to Schenley Park or
p Flagstiff Hill for an escape from
the city surrounding, the plaza 

provides a close_, convenient and
green hangout spot.

Still, considering the food, Pitt
is hardly a school stuck in some
desolate, countryside where stu-
dentshave to swallow whatever
school dining facilities cook up.
The surrounding area provides
plenty of options, and adding this
restaurant won’t really ﬁll any cui-
sine niche as far as_ type of food
offered. However,'if it’s open 24
hours — as is customary of Eat’n
Park restaurants — it’ll provide
students an alternative to late-

' night McDonald’s- runs.

Schenley Plaza used to be park-
ing lot, -— perhaps some commut-

For The Pitt News

Liberal media sources were atwitteras

Democrats pushedback againstpublic
outrage over the passage of President
Obama’s healthcare reform bill, claim-

’ ing a rash of incidents of vandalism

and intimidation. _
Whether the various claims made

are true or not remains to be proven. .

Assuredly, some of them are true,
but some of them have been mis-
construed: a coffin placed near Russ
Camahan’s ofﬁce, far from being a
death threat, turned out to be from
a pro-life prayer vigil representing a
burial for aborted children, causing
news sources, including Politico, to
retract the initially lurid story.

Acts of intimidation are indefen-
sible, but so too is the attempt to ex-
ploit them to smear those who dare
dissent. The Democratic leadership
has been guilty of this offense.

The reason Democrats have been

seizing on these claims and produc-
ing a narrative of a “dangerous cli-

A mate” is because they are afraid, not

of vandalism or intimidation, but of
electoral defeat. According to a Ras-

- mussen poll, 55 percent ofAmericans

want the healthcare reform bill to be
overturned, and a poll revealed a mar-'
ginally negative bounce in President
Obamasapproval rating.

Thus ushers in the narrative of
the unhinged protestors, with the
inference that all of the opposition to

. Obamacare is grounded in such levels

of political involvement. The goal is
to discredit the. entire opposition by
clingingto the most extreme actsthat
can be claimed. And the intended ef-
fect is to squelch dissent: “What, you
don’t support Obamacare? You must
be one of those crazy people hurling
racial slurs and making threatening
phone calls.” _ > ‘

Of course,.there’s little recogni— I‘

tion of the reality of similar acts
against Republicans. Recently Nor-

man Leboon, an_Obama donor, was_ '
charged with threatening to kill Rep. '

Opening reception: April 2,

Let’s play a game of rock, paper,

lost to paper. -

If you want a version of th
childhood contest where it’s impos-
sible to lose, then get your palms
ready. Three Pittsburgh galleries
are teaming up to present Rock,
Paper, Scissors '— an exhibition
inspired by the classic game.

‘_‘I have two boys, and the game
is away we resolve conﬂicts,” cura-

'tor Jill Larson‘said, who came up

with the exhibition’s theme a few
years ago. Larson, also an artist,
created a piece 10 years ago titled
“Rock, Paper, Scissors” but wanted
to see the theme incarnated on a

' larger scale. She also wanted to

ﬁnd. a way to bring together the
separate corners of Pittsburgh’s
‘art world. , . '
"‘I liked the idea that each ele-
ment can win, it’s not survival of
the ﬁttest,” she said. “I liked the
idea of having a show at three dif-
ferent places at the same time, I

just needed a reason to do it.”
So Larson organized for three

‘ galleries to host components of

the exhibition, ,
“This is a way to encourage
people to cross rivers and see other
galleries. We’re uniting different
communities and sending them

i on an art goose hunt.”

To aid people in getting from
one gallery to another, Molly’s
Trolleys is providing complimen-

tary transportation on opening .

night. The receptions will be stag-
gered, beginning with Artist Imag-
ing Resource (A.I.R.) and ending
at SPACE, and there will be per-
formance art by Nicole Czapinski
at eachlocation.

All but three of the exhibition’s
pieces were created speciﬁcally
for the show. Larson instructed
the contributing artists to think
beyond a literal interpretation of
rock, paper, scissors.’ “For paper,
I didn’t want theirjwork to be on
paper. I wanted it to be more sculp-
tural. So people used things like
tube coin wrappers and cupcake
liners.” ' -

Forget the ‘Titans, ’ bring on the Kraken

A 8r E Editor

“Clash of the Titans” .
Starring: Sam Worthington, Gem-
ma Arterton, Ralph Fiennes
Director: Louis Leterrier

Warner Bros. Pictures ,

Grade: D+‘ _

The original “Clash of the Titans”
(1981) was a cheese—tastica1ly bad
combination of bad writing, ridicu-
lous performances and supposedly
giant stop—mon'on beats that looked
more like the action ﬁgures I played
with when I was 10. A ’

Now, over 20 years later, produc-
ers decided itwas time to try the Greek

A mytho1ogy—laden adventure tale over

again. With CGI technology and an
exponentially increased budget, how

could it not work? Did I mention that g

it’s in 3-D?

Well, that hubris serves as this
pointless remake’s fatal ﬂaw. Even if
the ﬁlm weren’t such a blockbuster-
sized mess, the fact remains that this
is a completely pointless remake of a
terrible ﬁlm. Even more unfortunate
for the ﬁlmmakers and audiences
alike, the ﬁlm is just bad — really,
really bad. _ '. V

One positive thingto say aboutthis
bombastic remake is that it stays fairly

’ faithful to the original. Focusing on

ancient Greek hero Perseus, the ﬁlm
details his joumeyto defy the gods by

a sea monster that Hades warns will
be unleashed upon the city of Argos to

-punish the Greeks who have stopped

This involves ﬁghting giant scor-

. pions, seeking out a trio of wrinkly

witches, cutting offMedusa’s head and
ﬁnally saving the princess of Argos
from becoming Kraken lunch. Also,
there’s the whole notion that Perseus

ThePop Culture Round—up

Kieran gives his Easter themed picks for what’s hot, what’s not, and wha_t’s just okay

Kieran Layton
A 8» E Editor

It’s been quite a while, faithful readers,

since I have done a round-up of eVery—>

thing pop culture. Whereas last time I
had handy Halloween—themed labels to
aid me in distinguishing between what I
love, what I loathe and what I’m lukewarm
about, this time of year makes things a bit
more challenging. But worry not: I have
Easter to help my creative process.

Introducing I(ieran’s Easter-themed Guide
to Pop Culture. First, you have your choco-

late bunny, or what I am currently loving at .

the moment. Then, you have your ﬂat-out
rotten Easter eggs, which is what I (and
hopefully everyone) is hating on. Finally,

, there are the stale Peeps — items that I

am unsure about, because even though the
item might be “stale,” it’s still a Peep, thus

‘ deserving some serious recognition.

American Idol

Chocolate Bunny: SiobhanAMagnus
—— The quirky and cute ffontrunner in
the competition has -been a favorite of
mine since the audition episodes, and her
recent renditions of “Paint it Black” and

“House of the Rising Sun” were awesome. I

Last Tuesday’s off-pitch performance was
a mess_, but Magnus is still. my favorite
Idol contender. —

Rotten Easter Egg: Tim Urban — Seri-

ously, Zac Efron wannabe, go home. You '

have no vocal talent at all, let alone some-_
thing that sets you apart from the rest of
the competition. You should “Apologize”

' for Tuesday night’s performance, because .

it was horrendous. Take your wavy hair
and army of preteen girl4voters and go
audition for “High School Musical” a it’s
where you belong.

Stale Peep: Crystal Bowersox ~—— ‘She
is being touted as the frontrunner to win

the competition, but Pm not sold. Yes,’ If

love her voice, and she is certainly unique.
But call -me crazy, I am not a big fan of
uniqueness when it involves dreadlocks.
Some people can pullit off, she can’t. An
American Idol should look like, well, a
superstar, not someone you just want to

Rotten Easter Egg: i“Robin Hood” -

. I can’t remember the last time Russell

Crowehad a hit movie, and this looks like
a mess of clunky dialogue and whiplash-

‘inducing editing. I’m not sure why Ridley ‘
‘Scott thought a Robin Hood update was

necessary — or even welcome — but I
will be avoiding this one like the Sheriff
of Nottingham.

Stale Peep: “Twilight Saga:-Eclipse” —

' I’m not afraid to say it, I have both seen

and — gasp —— moderately enjoyed the
“Twilight” ﬁlms. With “New Moon” vastly
improving over the first ﬁlm, I have high
hopes that the third entry will continue
that trend. I understand, however, that
too much Robert Pattinson and Kristen
Stewart could be a very, very bad thing.

be as bad*ss as ever.

Social Networking Media by

Chocolate Bunny: Twitter — Whereas
a year ago I was wary of how Twitter was
rapidly growing in popularity, I think the
growth has leveled off somewhat, and I
couldn’t be happier with the friends it
has settled upon. @SexualTikTakToe and

@H'eyLaurHey are two great Pitt student I»

tweeters, and celebrities like @Snooki
(Snooki from “Jersey Shore”) have«consis—
tently amusing thoughts — usually about
tanning. ' '

Rotten Easter Egg: Facebook — Now
that I am nearing graduation and actual
employment opportunities, I have come
to see Facebook as a graveyard of previous
indiscretionsthat mightprevent me from
getting a job. Of course I’m exaggerating,
but the site still makes me feel more like a
stalker every time I check my'news feed.

sounds like the musical lovechild between
Britney-Spears and Lady Gaga, and while

it took a few listens to grow on me, I_can ,

officially declare my love forit. It’s-fast,
catchy and incredibly danceable. I hope

to hear it more and more as heralbum
, releasedate approaches.

Rotten Easter Egg: “Hey Soul Sister,”
Train .— This track is so superﬁcially
cheerful that it makes me want tocommit
violent acts against innocent bystanders.
Every time I hear that awful chorus onthe
radio — or worse, from someone hum-
ming it off—key —— I feel the urge to kick
Train’s a** back to the early years of the
new millennium, where they belong.

Stale Beep: Anything by Ke$ha —- She
was a fun, skank rock novelty at first, and

though “Blah Blah Blah” and other songs 4 I

are still a lot of fun to hear at the bars and

V at pre—gam,e parties, I think I’m starting

to feel like Ke$ha must feel after a night
out. No, not like P. Diddy —— like I need to
stick my ears in a shower.

9. Raymond was inspired by the Oscar winning
ﬁlm “Kramer vs. Kramer.” Usher character-
izes this particular exercise in catharsis as a

“racy” one. I cannot compliment him for tak- .

ing any major risks in style or content, but he
deﬁnitely delivered 14 tracks of fun, sexy and
melodic music. .

The ﬁrst thing to note about any Usher re-
lease is his terriﬁc voice. It is silky like the lin-

gerie -that he sings about slipping ofl'women’s .

bodies. His melodic vocal  are the highlights
of tracks like “There Goes My Body.” Usher’s
talent is only complemented by guest artists
Nicki Minaj on “Lil’ Freak” and consistent col—
laborator Ludacris on “She Don’t Know.”

Rag/mom’ v. Raymond might fail inshocking
fans with the brutal honesty that has distin-
guished Usher’s other releases, but it completely
succeeds in simultaneously supplying songs for
intimate dates and wild parties.

place at A.I.R., a print and imaging studio
in the North Side. “A.I.R. hosts printmakers
from all over the world. It has an interna-
tional reputation,” Larson said.

“Scissor” is hosted by the Fe Arts Gallery
in Lawrenceville. - v

“People had said that Fe" should host
Scissor because it’s cutting edge, but that
wasn’t the motivation,” said Larson. Artists

stallation of snipping

letters spelling““cu .”

SPACE in Down-
town’s Cultural Dis-
trict will hold “Rock.”
Artist Barbara Weiss-
berger, a studio arts
lecturer at Pitt, cre-
ated ‘a series -of ﬁve
large-scale digital col-
lages for the gallery.

f‘I tend to work
pretty associatively,
and I like looking at
things as psycho-
logical triggers. ‘So
I thought about the
[Greek mythology]
story of Prometheus

rock as punishment

go to -Montana every ‘ A‘ V‘ I I
year so I put a pho-
tograph of the Rocky
Mountains in the background of each image.
This was a nice coming together between
the show theme and materials I work with
normally.”

Weissberger, explained that her pieces '

are composed of small shapes cut from pho-
tographs of mountains, birds and meats
and abstract materials like cardboard and

B colored fabrics. “They’re very kaleidoscopic

and Rorschach-y.”
e “I don’t usually work in ‘response to a
theme, but there was a lot of serendipity and
happy surprise in working with this theme.
It was cool to work in a responsive way and
get my work to a place
it might not have been
led to otherwise.”

Delanie Jenkins,
another contributing
“Rock” artist and the
chair of Pitt’s Studio
Arts _department had
a similar experience
with the show’s theme.
“The curator has been
able to challenge the
artists. The theme
really made us "stop
and think — it’s been
a wonderful creative
stretch,” she said.

“In the hand game,
I. never understood
how paper covered
rock and disarmed
it, so I started think-
ing about how I could
use paper to disarm
rock.” Jenkins piece,
titled “Patterns -for
Disarmament,” is a
series of rock-like
ﬁgures composed of
tinted glue and paper
layers.

Jenkins said. she “thought about images
of people who are so frustrated all they have
left to do is pick up a rock and throw it. A
rock is a tool, how did it cross the line and
become a weapon?”

BASKETBALL

Dixon receives ex

l Amid rumors he might be leaving, the Pitt coach gets contract extended throughthe 2017-18 season.

Adam Littman "

Assistant Sports Editor

Despite another offseason of swirling

rumors, Pitt men’s basketball Head -

Coach Jamie Dixon isn’t going any-
where. .

In fact, he’s staying at Pitt even lon-
ger as Athletic Director Steve Peder-
son announced yesterday that Dixon
agreed to a two-year conuact exten-
sion, keeping DixonaPantherthrough
the2017-18 season. Pederson declined
to give out the monetary terms of the

deal and wouldn’t say whetheror not ‘

_it included a raise from Dix_on’s esti-
mated $1.5 million deal that was to
end after the 2015-16 season.

“This iswherelwantto be, andthis

is where I always hope to be,” Dixon

said yesterday.

Dixon has been on Pitt’s coaching '
staff for 11 years, including the last -

seven as the Panthers’ head coach. As

‘head coach he’s»led the panthers to

a 188-54 record and seven consecu-
tive NCAA Tournament appearances.
He won- Big East Coach, of the Year in
2004 and Naismith Coach of the Year
in '20 09, when he led Pitt to a school-
best 31-5 record and a trip to the Elite

Eight.

This oﬂfseason, Dixon’s name was
ﬂoated around as a possible candidate
for job openings at DePaul and Oregon.
In past years, Arizona, Arizona State
and Southern Californiawerejustsome
ofthe other schools reportedly looking
to pry Dixon away from Pitt.

“I’ve toldjamie I’d like to never have
to hire another basketball’coach,” Ped-
erson said.» ‘ ’ g H

h The rumors had nothingto do with

announcing the extension, Pederson ‘

said. .
“This is unrelated on anything
except performance and our desire

for him to be the coach here a long »

time,” he said.

Making sure people, whether fans
or recruits, know Dixon  be at Pitt
for a long time was a big reason for
working on the extension, which Dix-
on saidwasﬁrstbroughtup duringthe
middle of the season. 4

. “The stability we’ve had in basket-
ball here is part of the reason we are
where we are,” Pederson said. “Its key
to continuing the accelerated climb of

our program”

Stability has been an issue for nu— '

merous men’s basketball programs,
and continues to be as numerous
coaches have already been ﬁred. Just
inthe Big East, Seton Hallﬁred Bobby

Gonzalez, St. John’s ﬁred Norm Rob-
erts and DePaul ﬁredjeny Wainwright

injanuary andissu'lllookingforafull— ‘

time replacement. Other coaches to
get the axe after this season included
Boston College’s Al Skinner, Iowa’s
Todd Lickliter, Hawaii’s Bob Nash and
Oregon’s Emie Kent.

“In an age where there seems to "

be instability so much in coaching,

' it’s easy for young people to start to
vdistrustwhat’s goingto happen next,”

Pederson said. “You can look at the
University of Pittsburgh and say, ‘I’ve

got pretty good assurances of what’s a . _,

going to happen next.’”’
And next for Dixon and the Pan-
thers is ttyingto improve on a year in

. which many feel they overachieved,

tying for second in the Big East and

. reaching the second round of the

NCAA Tournament. That seems like
a good possibility for the Panthers —
they only lose starterJermaine.Dixon
and Chase Adams to graduation — no
matter how many different schools

are rumoredto be interested injamie . ’

Dixon.
“Fve been here 11years, and I don’t

said. “It’s either one way or the other:
They’re either getting rid of you or talk-

pains as his role on the team becomes

more signiﬁcant. To Wannstedt,
maintaining a proper mindset will
be a crucial component to the sopho-
more’s development.

“The key is that [Mason keeps]
the right attitude and he [wants] to
absorb and get better every day. As
long as he keeps that attitude, which
he has now, we’ll be fine,” Wannstedt
said.

The task of being a full—time

starter in his sophomore season’-~'
doesn’t seem to intimidate Mason. a

High expectations aren’t new to.-him,:
considering he was one of the most
touted and sought~after prospects in
Pitt’s 2009 recruiting class.

.“[I’m] just taking it one day at a
time, trying to get better and better
every day in all areas of the game,”

he said. _
Beyond replacing Gunn’s posi-

tion‘ on defense, Pitt will also need
someone to ﬁll the void in leadership
that he has left behind. Through the
beginning of spring practice, Mason
already leads his teammates with his

performance, according to Clark.

“He probably leads more by ex-
ample than anything else,” Clark said.
“He’s taking the lead in the huddle
because he’s playing hard [and] guys A
are looking for him to do something
to make them respond. In that aspect,
I think he’s a great leader.”

For the moment, Mason is con-
centrating on his own play and letting
everything else come gradually.

“If [my teammates] see me as a
leader, I’ll take on that role with afull
headof steam. I just try to go hard in

eriample,” he said.

Last year’s experience has given
Mason afoundation onwhich to build
and motivation for the upcoming
season. , »

“Once you taste college football

— it’s contagious, it’s addictive,” he

now I’m tryingto see it [for] the whole

BASEBALL

Pittrecogmlzed for  
achievements

Pitt nationally ranked, currently on record winning streak -

Tonyjovenitti
Sports Editor

Fresh off a hot start, the Pitt baseball team
broke into the national rankings this week._
It is in the top 30 of several national polls,

_and its highest ranking is No. 24 in the

Collegiate Baseball rankings. ,

’ The team also broke onelof the lon-
gest—standing records in school history.
In 1965, the baseball team won 10 games
in a row. When Joe Jordano coached this
year’s Panthers to victory over St.John’s on
Sunday, it marked the team’s 11th straight,
bringing Pitt’s record to 18-4.

[Pitt has a chance to extend that historic

I streak when it travels to Rutgers today for

the first of a three—game series.

Pitt is ranked No. 29 in the Perfect
Game USA’s weekly top 50. Last week the
Panthers were unranked. A

. Pitt is one of the highest—ranked Big
East teams, trailing only No. 11 Louisville.
The Panthers will host the Cardinals next
weekend at Trees Field.

Jordano said that the rankings are

great, but he cautioned his players of be— -

coming overconfident.

“[I] likened it to being in the lead af-
ter two furlongs of the Kentucky Derby,”
Jordano said in an interview with The Pitt

.News. “We need to ﬁnish.”

The team’s success is accompanied by

individual success from several Panthers.

Three of Pitt’s starting pitchers — Corey P

Baker, Matt Iannazzo and Nathan Hood
e are undefeated with a combined record
of 14-0.

Despite that successful pitching, Jor-
dano still thinks there is room for im-
provement.

“Obviously [they];’have pitched well.
But I feel they have not peaked yet,” he
said.

He also pointed out the talent of the
rest of the pitching corps.

“Our [bullpen] _has done a solid job as
well,” he said. “Pitching is always the key
to a successful year.”

Also, senior shortstop Danny Lopez was
named to the Brooks Wallace Award watch
list._The award is given to the nation’s best
shortstop. Lopez leads the team with 37
runs scored and 16 stolen bases. He also

. _ has three homeruns.

“Danny is a very solid_player. He has
great actions and has great foot speed,”
Jordano said.

Jordano said Lopez is unlike most team
leaders. .

“Danny leads in his own way,” he said.
“He is not very vocal, but his actions speak
volumes.” ’

Lopez joins three other Big East short-
stops on the watch list: Cont1ecticut’s Nick
Ahmed, Louisville’s'Adam Duvall and West
Virginia’s Jedd Gyorko. _

Jordano spoke to the team to acknowl-'

edge its recent accolades, but he then

turned his attention to the rest of the ,

season. . .
"‘Following our talk prior to Tues-
day’s practice_, we went back to work,”
he said. A
He, said his goal for the season is sim-
ple, “Be the best we can be everyday.”

Michigan State overcame adversity

Izzo 4 25

best coaches in history, like Wooden and Coach
K can claim. It’s far simpler than that.

Izzo knows how to utilize talent. He is an X’s
and O’s guy who assesses what he has and does
the best job possible with what’s available. Think
about it: in the Big Ten tournament the Spartans
lost a dreadﬁil game to Minnesota. They get a
ﬁve seed after starting the season as top-5 squad
nationally. Lucas goes down forthe year. All signs
point to a collapse by a bewildered team.

‘ Not in Izzo’s world. Instead, he’s playingwalk—
onsincrunchtime, runningathree-guard offense
and sometimes has his powerforward bring the
ball over halfcourt. .

‘ College basketball, as opposed to the pro
game, is a coach’s domain. Players don’t dictate
in college the wayaKobe Bryant—type player con-
ducts the game on the ﬂoor. So when you see a
beat—up team, picked by nobody, overcoming
hardship to play in the Final Four, you know it’s '
coming from the head coach. ’

Izzo is currently writing the book on how i

to manage the tournament. He’s manipulating
match-ups and preparingbetterthanotherteams
and other coaches. It’s what has schools like Or~
egon gearing up to offer Izzo a contract of mam-

mothpropottzionstolurehimawayﬁfonihishome ' V

state. Izzo currently makes about $3 million ayear
and Oregonhasﬁnancialbackingfrom Nikethat
could give him a pay raise if he leaves.

  

Bottom line, Tom Izzo isn’t the best coach
to ever grace tournament hardwood. That may
be Coach K or probably Wooden. But he is the
best coach right now, this year and over the past
10 years. And if he somehow pulls off a national
championship come nextweek, perhaps against
Duke’s Royal Highness himself, no one will de-
bate it. ,

Now  for some rapid ﬁre:

—The Steelers are ‘in shambles. First Big Ben
faces his second sexual assault accusation in the

past eight months and now Santonio Holmes al-
legedlyverbally assaults — and throws a drink at
— awoman in anight club. No wonderthey didfft

make the playoffs. Nothinghas been proven, but .

the reports are troublesome nonetheless. Can
you say Bengals?
