ODK Completes
Plans To Select
Prominent Senior

Undergraduate, Graduate Seniors
Will Be Eligible For Balloting
To Occur Early In March

Plans have been completed f0!‘ the
election, early in March, of the “out-
standing senior,” who will receive the
Omicron Delta Kappa
May.

As in last year’s election, senior
men in the undergraduate schools,
and also those in the Schools of Medi-
cine, Dentistry, and Pharmacy are
eligible to vote. A committee Of
junior men has been appointed by
Russell Connelly, C36, and president
of ODK, to supervise the selection.
This committee, headed by =HaI‘I_‘Y
Zinsser, Med39, is composed of Davld
Racusin, BA37, William .McQuad_e.
E37, Leo Ryan, C37, William Blair,
-C37, Edwin Lincoln, C37, Dale V311
Q1-mgr, E37, and,W. Gordon Rauck,
C37.

lRacusin will also head a committee
to further plans for the ODK Walk.
3, proposed stone pavement extending
from the front of the Cathedral to
‘Heinz Chapel, At present, plans call
for the inscription of the name of the
outstanding senior each year on
granite blocks which will line the
walk. _

A change has been necessitated in
the balloting because of the failure
 SFA to include an identiﬁcation
the registration procedure

card in
for this semester. Charles Herald,
C36, as chairman of the amending

committee, has drawn up a. new code
for use in this election. A list con-
taining the name of every undergrad‘
uate senior will be held at the poll-
ing place, Room 801, Cathedral, and
as each senior votes, he must sign
his name opposite his place on the
list. This method was used last year
in the graduate schools. There will
be only one central polling place for
undergraduate seniors, instead of the
several which were scattered over
the campus last March. Graduate
school students will vote in their re-
spective buildings. -

Connolly emphasized the fact that
this election -will »-have -- the effect
merely of recommending as to popu-
larity one or several names to the
ODK faculty and alumni committee
which will make the ﬁnal decision.
This committee, as in 1935, will use
a six-point basis for judging, includ-
ing scholarship, activities record,
service to the University, leadership,
character, and social bearing.

The committee is headed by Dr.
Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of men,
and includes Carl Cass, assistant pro-
fessor of English, Dr. Omar ‘C. Held,
personnel assistant to the dean of the
College, and Robert Ayars, professor
of accounting, as its three faculty
members, and Walter Rome, head of
the Juvenile Detention Home, as
alumnus member.

Grove Discusses New
Tests efore Forum

 

Formiboards Of Kent-Shakow 'S"er-i’e's
Subject Of Psychology Talk

William R. ‘Grove, assistant psy-
chologist at the Western State peni-
tentiary, addressed the -Psychology
Forum, Monday evening, discussing
the modiﬁcations he has made in the
formboards of the Kent-Shakow ser-
ies, as applied to the prisoners at the
penitentiary.

Formboards are boards with re-
cesses which the subject ﬁlls in with
the cut-out parts. These tests have
their value, in that they are not lin-
guistic or verbalistic. Intelligence is
based on performance with concrete
problems.

Mr, Grove’s modiﬁcations ‘of the
board reduce the complexity of the
original and make one solution pos-
sible.

‘Mr. Grove received this M. A. de-
gree at the University and has had
the help of Dr, William T. ‘Root, dean
of the Graduate School and professor
and head of the department of psy-
chology in his revision of the Kent-
Shakow board.

Dr. George Ellis Jones, professor
of psychology, was chairman "of the
forum. .

Players To Present Shaiiian
Play For Two-Night Stand

Sophisticated ‘Candida’ Is Scheduled For Opening
Tonight At Pittsburgh Playhouse

 

 

George Bernard Shaw's character-
istic greeting to Americans is, “Hello,
boobs!”

But Pitt Play-
ers are going to
produce his play
tonight over at
the Pittsburgh
Civic Playhouse
——one of his so-
called “pleasant”
plays — “Candi-
da” by name.

It is reputed to
be a_ sophisticat-
ed play, and
Shaw himself de-
scribes it as a
coiiﬂict between
the stern, prac-
H°"'Ym°" Mame“ tical Christian
Socialism of the Very ’Revei'end James
Morrelland the weaker, impractical,
but higher and more beautiful ideal-
ism of Eugene Marchbanks, a poet.

The story hinges around the intru-
sion of Mr. Marchbanks into the home
life of Reverend Morrell and Candida,
his beloved and beautiful young wife.
Candida has found Marchbanks, an
outcast from his well-to-do family,
sleeping on some sort of embankment
in a park. She takes him home with
her, where he promptly begins to
make himself obnoxious to Reverend
Morrell.

Marchbanks has been badly smit-
ten with love for his beiiefactress. He
imagines, from Candida’s tender treat-
ment, that she requites his love, and
is not reticent in telling Morrell the
facts in the case.

Morrell says, “Tut—tut,” and calmly
explains that all men fall in love with
his wife, but he doesii’t mind. It
pleases his vanity—aiid he is quite
certain in his own mi1id__ of__ Candida's
ﬁdelity to her lawful husband. .

His smugness is removed in time]

 

Marchbanks is so persistent and there
is a certain amount of evidence on
his side—foi- instance, the compromis-
ing position in which Morrell ﬁnds
the two before the ﬁre one night.
Nothing that one could win a divorce
on, but well—at least, a triﬂe dis-
turbiiig.

Marchbanks keeps demanding that
Morrell free Candida, reiterating his
belief that Morrell is a bombastic,
rhetorical fool, and not worthy of his
wife. Such an accusation might well
become aggravating in time, and no
one is greatly surprised when he col-
lars the iiiterloper and threatens to
beat him to a pulp. The poet recoils,
and cries for the somewhat formida-
ble-lookiiig minister not to touch him.

The affair culminates "when the
two carry their grief to Candida, and
tell her she must choose between
them. She is astonished at the turn
affairs have taken. She hadn’t any
idea the two dear boys were working
themselves up so over-her. So in her
usual calm, cool, collected way, she
sets the whole business right.

Characters in the play are: Louise
McKirdy, C36, Candida; Herrymon
Maurer, C36, the righteous and ag-
gressive Reverend Morrell; Marquis
Patterson, C36, the sensitive and dis-
concertingly frank poet; Betty Knop,
C34, Prossey, the secretary; Charles
Blaker, E37, -the coarse businessman;

and William Kunkel, C39, Alexander :

Mill, the young clergyman from Cam-
bridge.

Others who have helped in prepara-
tion for the play are: Lyda Baltz, C37,
costumes; Regina McCabe, C37, prop-
erties, assisted by Robert Madden,
C37, VVilliam Schanbacher, C36, and
Ruth Robefts, Ed36; Hannah Raphael,
C37, assistant director; Jack Speer,

38, stage manager; Frank Otte, C39,
electrician; and Jack Robson, EEBG,
technical manager.

Scholars’ Tapping
Set Forph/larch 13

Schenley Ballroom -To Feature
Ceremony During Fourth Hour

The annual Scholars’ Tap Day.
scheduled for March 13, will be held
in the main ballroom of the Hotel
Schenley during fourth hour, accord-
ing to the plans of the Scholars Dav
committee of SF-A, headed by Israel
L. Goldberg, C36.

The purpose of the annual Tap Dav
is to provide a deﬁnite time when all
honorary fraternities at the Universi-
ty may announce their initiates for
the coming year.

The committee has been negotiat-
ing for a speaker from the Mid-West
to address the gathering. At the pres-
ent time it is contacting officers of
all scholastic groups who announce
tappees in the spring.

According to Goldberg, the reason
for having the affair early in the year,
is to have a date that will be suitable
for all the activities who wish to par-
ticipate. '

Last year, 260 students were tapped
by 16 organizations at ceremonies in
Memorial Hall. Those represented
were: Sigma Tau, honorary engineer-
ing; Beta Gamma Sigma, honorary
business administration; Chi Rho
Nu, honorary pre-medical; Collem-
bolae, honorary natural science; Del-
ta Sigma Rho, honoi'a.ry debating;
John Marshall =Club, honorary pre-le-
gal; Kappa Phi Kappa, honorary edu-
cation; Phi Alpha Theta,. honorary
history; Pi La‘rn,:19_da Theta,~ women's
education; Pi Sigma Alpha, honorary
political science; Pi Tau Phi, honor-
ary college scholastic; Quax, honorary
natural science for women; Quill Club,
honorary literary; Phi Lambda Upsi-
-Ion, honorary chemistry; Sigma Gam-
ma Epsilon, honorary mines; and Sig-
ma Kappa Phi, honorary language.

‘Fully as many groups are ‘expected
by the committee to participate this
year.

SFA Poll Committee
Begins Survey Friday

 

Beginning Friday, the ﬁrst poll
to be taken by the SFA survey
committee will be begun, on the
question: “Are you in favor of the
elimination of ﬁfth hour classes?’

A preliminary poll was taken
earlier in the year, but this sur-
vey will serve to augment the for-
mer results and make them more
authoritative. Members of the
committee which will work on this
ﬁrst survey include Leonard Se-
der, C37, and Herbert Rackoff,
C38, co-chairmen, Elizabeth Black,
BA36, Courtland Leigh, C37, Wil-
liam Blair, 037, Jack Levine,
BA39, William Schenck, BA37,

Russell Connolly, C36, Barbara
Thomas, BA37, Thomas Howard,
C37, and R. F. Blackburn, assistant
professor of statistics. Action will
probably be taken this afternoon
toward passing upon the commit-
tee members.

Seder has called a meeting of
the committee for this afternoon
at 3:30 o'clock in Room 801, C3

,Needs For Social
Control Stressed
In Assembly Talk

The two most vital principles of
life are those of adjustment to en-
vironment and control of environ-
ment, according to Dr. H. H. Crane
who spoke before a fourth hour as-
sembly Monday morning.

ment of environment, has dominated
our thinking. The theory behind it
is that individuals survive only as
long as they are able to meet chang-
ing conditions successfully. Such
slogans and catch phrases as~.“-sur-
vival of the ﬁttest” suggest the pre-
mium which we have placed upon the
ability to adjust to our surroundings.
But the second principle, said Dr.
Crane, is more important. By con-
trol is meant the capacity of man to
change in a limited degree his en-
vironment to suit himself, to mold
his particular world more after his
own desire. “All our great advances
have been along this principle,” ex-
claimed Dr. Crane, “and to the degree
that we make use of this principle of

human heritage.”

Inseparably bound up with this
principle of control is what Dr. Crane
calls “‘the reality of possibility.” It
is this belief in the ultimate possibil-
ity of something we desire that causes
us to function to a great extent in
terms of what may be. ‘‘It is this
reality of possibility,” said the speak-
er, “which is the thing that moti-
vates our actions. We are always
haunted by the possibility of reality
——of what might be.”

In connection with these principles
of life, Dr. Crane points out that two
speciﬁc types of minds have devel-
oped. The ﬁrst kind is that adept in
deferring to the opinions and ideas
of others. People of this type have
no deﬁnite convictions, and they are

CA Loan Fund

In ‘inter Formal ’ Basketl

J. G. QUICK, Registrar.

Puts All Eggs

 

Officers -and members of the cabinet
of the College Association are busy
again these days.

"Refusing to allow the general stu-
dent body, and particularly the rank
and ﬁle in the College, to forget that
the CA conducts a tidy loan fund for
needy students, and, incidentally,
sponsors twowdances each semester,
the group has ﬂooded the campus with

$1 tickets for the coming Winter
Formal.
It’s entirely a new scheme this

time. While heretofore the Associa-
tion has made it known that it con-
ducts its popular loan fund, it has
seemingly carried on its dances to-
tally independently. This time it’s
all coming out of the bushes.

Every cent cleared on the coming
dance, scheduled for a week from Fri-
day at the Hotel Schenley, will be
turned over to the limping fund, now
down to a negligible amount.

This decision was made at a meet-
ing of the cabinet Sunday afternoon.

In the past, the group has waited
until the end of the year to appro-
priate amounts to the fund, but de-
spite a former reserve of almost $600,
including $100 turned into it last
spring, ‘the fund is now down, down,
down. Numerous loans to worthy
students in need ‘this past semester
have emphasized the necessity of

adding to the total, says President
Paul Keiser, ’36.

‘Therefore, Keiser, William Hughes,
'36, social chairman, Edwin Beachler,
’37, vice president, Doris Evans, ’37,
secretary, Theodore Whitaker, ’38,
treasurer, Charles B. Holstein, '36,
publicity chairman, Lucy Conn, ’37,
ﬁnance chairman, Paul Kohberger,
’38, Anne June Elmer, ’36, Martha
Fuller, ’37, Gertrude Schein, ’36, Bev-
erly Brown, ’37, and Anthony -Lucas,
’36, among others, are selling those
$1 admission tickets to the Winter
Formal with zeal.

In the office of the College, Room
205, State Hall, and in the office of
the dean of men, Room 801, Cathedral,
tickets are also available.

The CA loan fund is one of the few
on campus which extends short time
assistance of amounts up to $50-
extensions sometimes granted even
until after graduation. Students in the
College have found it of immeasura-
ble assistance on numerous occasions
for all sorts of emergencies.

No orchestra has been selected for
the Winter Formal, but a release is
expected soon from Keiser and his
group.

The Winter Formal is the only
formal dance on the social program
lziaare until the Military Ball on March
in that time is the Engineering

Association‘ informal on March 6.

Opens Today For
13 Men’s Groups

Regular Pledge Drive For First
Semester Freshmen Begins
Just Before First Hour

It was less than half an hour ago
that you were dated with fraternity
men at fraternity houses forevery
meal and evening for the rest of the
week.

That is, it was less than half an
hour ago if you picked up this paper
before your ﬁrst hour class, and if
you are a ﬁrst semester freshman
man.

Or maybe the fraternities .haven’t
caught up with you yet. But if they
haven’t, don’t worry, they will. ’

For at 8 o’clock (exactly, mot ap-

proximately) this morning, _was in- r '

augurated the official rushing season
for ﬁrst semester freshman men.
From now on, continuing up to 2
o’clock Sunday morning, 13 fraterni-
ties will be seeking to rush and pledge
the 70 or 75 men who make up the
class of 19391,f, at the University.
Starting tonight with smokers at
most houses, rushing season will "con-_
tinue with open houses, Monte Carlo’
nights, theater parties, and house'-
dates. Most fraternities, will wind-
up with a grand dance on Saturday
evening, a dance which must be
over by 12 o’clock, and which must,‘
according to stringent interfraternityv
rules be held within the fraternity

house or quarters.

After this intensive four-day‘-period,

rushees and fraternity men alike will
suffer a respite of ﬁve ‘days until next
Tliursday, when the bids accepted are
made public, and the new pledges are
inducted. No rushing of any kind is-
permitted during this so-called
“silence” period.
,Accoi'ding to advice given by N.
Robert Seidle, assistant to the ‘dean
of men, every freshman, whether he.
is considering pledging a. fraternity
or not, should accept every possible.
invitation, and talre advantage of the
chance to make a great number of

The Players Work

_ _ HEN THE CURTAIN goes up on the open-
ing act of “Candida” tonight, another
chapter in the long series of eﬁorts on the

part of meinbersin Pitt Players will be concluded.
To be sure, there will still be the business of put-
ting on the two performances. But when every-
thing  in readiness for the show to begin, that
will mean the end of a long period of hard work
on the part of quite a few students, many of whom
will never look at the audience across the foot-
lights.

There is more to the Players’ organization than
many folks would suppose. Last year the me1nber-
ship ran to 250, a ﬁgure appearing more remark-
able still when compared to the total of 90 only
six years ago, with freshman women members be-
ing included in the latter ﬁgure.

It was then that Carl B. Cass came upon the
scene. Under his direction, activities of the Play-
ers experienced a mushroom growth. Countless
one-act plays were augmenting the three major
productions of the year, bringing more and more
students into the dra.matic fold and presenting en-
tertainment which became more and more appre-
ciated by the campus as evidenced by doubled at-
tendance at the shows.

Not always has there been milk and honey for
the group. Lack of a central meeting place, lack
of a theater to present their plays, and lack of
funds to pay royalties and rents on the auditoriums
leased for performances, all these have hindered
the Players. Almost without exception the budget
ias forced one-performance schedules. Thus an oc-
casional “bad night,” which in theater becomes
nothing more than a. “bad night,” has made it a

.,§)ad play altogether for the Pitt actors.

These obstacles haven ’t stopped the group. An

-'eilic.ien..t and highly-developed technical staff has

gathered and built a wealth of lighting and set

-equipment, proceeds from whose rental goes a. long

way in bridging the gap between appropriation

._.angl expenses.

l°1.lready Mr. Cass and his sizable crew of ambi-
’tious ‘students are looking forward to their Play-
ers’ Paradise. Witli the completion of the Stephen
C. Foster Memorial, the group plans to collect it-
self and its belonging from the scattered places 1t
now occupies and move lock, stock, and barrel to
this new home, where space, stage, and auditorium
will be theirs for the asking.

It is certainly nothing of discredit to hazard the
observation that the lure of proposed four-per-
formance shows will ever make. those members who
form the backbone of the Players then put their
efforts more wl1o1e:heartedl_v into the Job than
their predecessors have done before a11d are doing
now for one or two-night stands.

A Million Thanks

UDGING FROM INCOMPLETE reports, it ap-
ﬁr, pears certain that the American Olympic Fund
 will be swelled by almost $150 as a result of
The Pitt News Track and Field Meet Saturday. VVe
are happy to have achieved that success and we
are eager to share the credit with those of the
University who made that success possible.

All the publicity, all the backing, all the edito-
rial comment we could have given the venture
would not have made the meet the event that it
was To the faculty members who assisted in run-
ning off events, to the WAA girls who provided
and awarded suitable prizes, to the members of
the University Band who played faithfully all aft-
ernoon, and to the trackmen and coaches them-
selves who put out the best that they had to make
the‘ meet interesting and spectacular for spectators
-——to all these The News is deeply indebted.

No effort was spared to give the meet a ﬂavor
entirely different from those that ha.ve been here
before-—one that had something of the true Olym-
pics spirit. And if everyone who attended got the
same thrill which prompted the freshman football
player to say, when the crowd hushed and stood
bareheaded as the trumpets played “The Star-
Spangled Banner” during the ﬂag-raising, “Gee,
you know that kinda gets you,” we’re sure we
would have wanted to call the affair a success if
we hadn't made one red cent.

Among The Faculty

By Sally Belcastro

DOCTOR B. H. WILLIAMS, professor of political
science . . . Was born in Oregon . . . He attended the
University of Oregon and in 1910 he received his B.A.
from the University . While in college he partici-
pated in athletics and was captain of his college track
team. In 1912 he took his M.A. at the same University
. The University of California gave him his PhD in

. . Dr. Williams has been abroad several times
. In 1913 he worked his way to Europe on a cattle
boat. On that trip he spent most of his time in England

. In 1918 he joined the AEF and again crossed the
ocean . . This time he went to France. Dr. Williams
took another trip to Europe in the summer of 1932,
spending most of his time at Geneva . . . Like many of
the teachers of the University, Dr. VVi1liams has known
other occupations besides teaching. In the years 1914-
1916 he worked as a statistician in the state of Oregon;
he had to give this position up because it was too hard
on the eyes . . . He also claims to have been in the ex-
porting business one summer (he hauled lumber into a
car) while working in a. logging camp . . He has not
been back West for about four years . . Like a true
W'esterner, he believes that the living conditions of the
Paciﬁc Coast are superior to those of the East because
the VVest is an out-or-door, open-air country . . He, of
course, admits that there are qualities that make the
East much more interesting than the other sections of
the land . . . He has found the people of Pittsburgh are
more amiable and that the faculty of the University is
much more democratic and friendly than the ones in the
older schools of the country . . Dr. Williams has also
noticed a difference in the attitude of the people towards
politics . . . "Western people seem to be more interested
in political conditions and their sentiments are more
easily aroused . . . Then, too, the corruption that exists
in the complex industrial cities of the East cannot exist
in the rural districts of the West . . Insofar as his
favorite hobby is concerned he admits that at one time
when he was out West he did a great deal of mountain
biking. but he no longer indulges in this sport . . . At
the present time he is trying to learn to skate . . . And
he is also learning how to play golf . . . He likes music
a great deal . . . Schubert is his favorite composer . . .
He likes the movies and his favorite actor is Emil Jan-
nings . . He has seen a good many foreign pictures
an_d he feels that they show a. great dea.l of American
inﬂuence in their interpretation of a theme . He
was very much amusedvwhen he saw the two American
comics-."=Laur‘el and Hardy, speaking German in :1 German
movie house . . . In France he saw another amusing in-
terpretation of American life in the movie, “The Son
From America” . . . Dr. Vvilliams does not care to read
ﬁction . . . He likes poetry (not Victorian poetry) . .
He has no time to read ﬁction and so he does not care
for it . . . He spends most of his spare time writing ar-
ticles and books . . He has written a number of ar-
ticles on political science and on international affairs

. . . Among his books are The Economic Foreign Poli-
cies of the United States and The United States and Dis-
armament . . . He also has written American Diplomacy
which is still in press . . Dr. Williams is married and
has two children, a girl and a boy.

All Furnishings For Cathedral Library

 

Are ReadyAFor Placement ‘In New Rooms

Chairs Covered By Colored
Leather Will Feature
Elaborate Plans

By Harold Hoffman

With the arrival of more than 40
library tables last week-end, furnisl1-
ings for the University Library, to be
located on the fourth, ﬁfth, and sixth
floors of the Cathedral, are nearing
completion. Most of the specially de-
signed furniture, from lounges to
waste baskets, has arrived and is be-
ing storcd until the library opens in
the spring.

The delivery room, facing Belleﬁeld
Avenue, . has been equipped with a
large oak-paneled charging desk. In
the center of the large square desk is
the book elevator, covered in a de-
sign similar to that of the desk.

VVhen a book is desired, the call
slip will be sent to the fourth ﬂoor
stacks by means of pneumatic tubes.
Attendants will secure the book and
send it, by the elevator, to the main
desk on the ﬂoor above, where it will
be delivered to the student. An
auxiliary desk has been installed in
the reference room for books that
do not have to be secured from the
storage stacks.

In the public catalogue room, on
the Fifth Avenue side, two large bat-
teries of catalogue drawers have been
constructed. Over 1,000 drawers are

included, along with convenient slid-
ing writing shelves. A unique feature
of the drawers is that thecard racks
on the lowermost drawers are tilted
upward at an angle to insure easy
reading of the drawer tags. Long
writing desks have been provided be-
tween the drawer batteries.

Card catalogue ﬁles have been de-
signed for the periodical room. Along
with the conventional book trucks,
box-like carts with a top which sinks
to accomodate books have been pro-
vided to move books from one part
of the library to another.

In the three main rooms of the
ﬁfth ﬂoor group, upholstered chairs
and lounges will be scattered about.
Nineteen leather - colored lounge
chairs, green and orange-red. are ready
to’ be put into service as soon as the
library opens. Lounges of varying
size, upholstered in tau, green, and
orange leather will harmonize with
the interior decorations in each room.
Several wing-back lounge chairs are
to be placed in the reference room.
Four large lounge chairs in dark
brown leather will be placed in the
delivery room to match the decora-
tions.

Small round chairs in tan. red, and
brown leather will be used in the
corners of some of the rooms. In-
cluded in the furnishings of the peri-
odical room will be 30 straight, chairs
with leather seats. All rooms will
contain straight chairs. with leather

Hallock Describes Executive

7

Qualities At PBI Luncheon

Nothing Is Mystic, Magic
Or Imposing About
It, He States

By John Martinco

“There is nothing mystic, magic, or
imposing in the ﬁeld of executive en-
deavors,” declared John W. Hallock,
secretary of the General Alumni As-
sociation as he spoke on “The Tech-
nique of Executive Control” at a
luncheon sponsored by the Pitt Busi-
ness Institute Monday at Heinz
House.

Mr vH—allock ﬁrst refuted the popu- '

lar idea that executive ability is a
“god-given thing” He emphasized
the difference between administrative
a.nd executive work by deﬁning the
administrative work as the decision
of major policies and issues which
then devolve on the executive to car-
ry out

“There are three primary requis-
ites in an individual for the ﬁeld of
administration,’ he stated. These he
enumerated as moral uprightness,
physical vigor, and a given level of
intelligence. If a person measures up
to these three qualities, according to
Mr. Hallock, they must still possess
three more. The ﬁrst he presented
was “interest in and affection for
people.” “By that,” he explained, "I
mean a keen, sincere interest in their
welfare, both economic and social.”

As his second point he mentioned
the “power of personality.” “The lead-
ers are those who by personal mag-
netism force cooperation,” he noted.
“A scientiﬁc attitude to his work” he
rated as the third requirement, This,
as he elaborated, entails “ability to
take the experience of the past, sift
the good from the bad, and build on
them later experiences.”

To be successful, the executive
must use certain tools, according to
Mr. uHallock. These tools he divided
into several categories. Under stim-
ulating tools, he listed enthusiasm,
cheerfulness, and unselﬁshness. In
another-division he mentioned recep-
tivity, frankness, impressiveness, and
sincerity., As conﬁrming tools he
named tolerance and tact and classed
dignity and courtesy as restraining
tools. Lastly, as tools for fashioning
loyalty he emphasized kindliness and
friendliness.

He pointed out “we have two fund-
a.mental bulwarks of American indus-
try and labor, namely capital and la-
bor.” These he likened to two piers
of a‘ bridge, between which is a gulf
or chasm. He described this struc-
ture as a connection between the
worker and the executive. He said,
however, “I question the depth of un-
derstanding between capital and la-

bor.” “There is no way of bridging
the gap,” he affirmed, “except by
management."

In conclusion he stated, “A little
self-analysis, self-study, and persev-
erance will make 100 per cent execu-
tive timber of any Pitt man or woman
I know.”

Here It Is—Dr. Carlson’s
Advice To Watch Colds

Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of the
Student Health Service for men at
Falk Clinic, warns: “Watch that
cold!”

The particular length and sever-
ity of wintry weather this year has
emphasized the usual falling off in
cold and infection resistance al-
ways current during the winter
months, and colds are especially
numerous in the city.

The human body reaches its low-
est levels of resistance (luring
March and April months, research
has shown, but February has al-
ways proved menacing, he said.

Pneumonia has also been partic-
ularly prevalent this winter, ac-
cording to Dr. Carlson, who advises
strict attention to all colds and
minor winter ailments, which can
easily develop into the dreaded
malady. ,

At present a flu epidemic is rag-
ing in Hawaii, and past experiences
with such epidemics in outlying
territories has shown that the
mainland usually catches its rav-
ages. '

Panther Mitt T

eam Departs

For Wisconsin Tomorrow

Seek T0 Avenge Defeat‘
In Second Battle
With Badgers

Coach Jack Schricker plans to send
the Panther boxers through their ﬁnal
workout tonight in preparation for the
W'isconsin match Friday night at
Madison. Friday's match, which opens
the season for the Badger mittmen,
marks the ﬁfth ring appearance of the
Panthers team.

Pitt's leather-throwers will seek re-
venge for their 5% to 21/2 setback, ad-
ministered by the Badger sluggers in
last year's meeting. Reports from
‘Wisconsin indicate that the Big Ten
contenders have a veteran squad that
promises to go far in Intercollegiate
-competition.

Schricker reports that the Pitt boys
recovered from the Catholic U set-
back in ﬁne shape. “The squad came
back ﬁghting and really hopes to put
up a great ﬁght against the favored
Badgers,” reported Schricker yester-
-day.

Only two of the present Panther
boxers faced Wisconsin last year.
Dines will seek his second straight
victory over a Badger representative,
while Paslowski is determined to
avenge the decision awarded against
him in 1935. Al's biting left has out-
punched four straight opponents so
‘far this season.

Schricker plans to use Russ Vogel,
who dropped a close decision to
Guinan of Catholic U last Saturday,
in the 115-pound class. Paslowski
throws leather in the 125-pound event.

In the 135-pound division, Abe
Konick should came back strong after
losing a tough, disputed decision in
the Catholic U tussle. Tomarelli holds
down the 145-pound assignment, and
Dines may give way to Kennedy in
the 155-pound event, according to a
late report by Schricker.

Leonard gets the nod in the mid-

dleweight division, with Cleon Lin-
«derman, a member of the football
squad, dishing it out in the light-

heavyweight class. Ted Schmidt re-
places Frank Patrick in the heavy
ﬁnal a.fter a week's absence as the re-
sult of a cut over. the left eye.

The squad along with Schricker and
Manager Pero departs early tomorrow
morning, enroute to Madison, Wiscon-
sin, and will arrive late Friday after-
noon. Planning to stay over Friday
night Summary of Saturday's match:

115-pound class—Francis Guinan. Catholic

Passers To Meet
Notre Dame Next

Play Irish Quintet On Saturday;
Ramblers Sport Fine Record

 

 

For the second time this week the
Panther basketball team ﬁnds itself
stacked up against one of the coun-
try's leading ﬁves, when the boys
travel out to South Bend to meet
Notre Dame's great cagers Satur
day night.

Last night the Golden Cats met
the Dukes in their return game at
the Stadium, the Dukes entering the
game sporting a run of ten straight
triumphs. Saturday night the Pan-
thers face a team that has also a ten-
game winning streak and a record of
17 games won out of 19 games played.

It was a little over a month ago
when the Panthers and the Irish
tangled in the first of their two-game
series. Up until that time the Pitt
boys owned four straight victories
over the Notre Dame ﬂoor outﬁt, but
after the ball game was over there
was little left of the Panther’s streak
except a. bit of space in the record
books. For the Irish that evening
suddenly found themselves late in the
second half and poured in enough
baskets to win by a 43-35 margin.

Saturday night the Panthers will
be out to atone for that whipping, and
at least earn an even break in the
two games played this season. A look
at comparative records makes the
Panther cause seem a little improba-
ble. Only a few days ago the Irish
swamped a Kentucky ﬁve, 42-20, that
had previously swamped the Panther
ﬁve earlier in the season, 35-17. Ac-
cording to Dodd's system of mathe-
matics that gives the Irish a: 40-point
working advantage. Fortunately, com-
parative scores mean little.

Coach George Koegaii has two start-
ing teams of equal ability, one made
up of sophomores, one of veterans.
The veterans show Co-captains John-
ny Ford and Marty Peters at for-
wards, Ireland at center, and Wade
and Jordan at the guards. On the
sophomore outﬁt are Meyer and Moir
at forwards, Nowak at center, and
Wukowitz and Evans at guards.
Nowak is the boy that spelled defeat
correctly for the Panthers in the first
game with his grand total of 16 points.

 

Varsity Matmen To Meet
F & M Grapplers Saturday

Although unsuccessful in the ﬁrst
three attempts, Coach Mazeski’s grap-
plers travel to Lancaster Saturday
determined to pin the Franklin and
Marshall matmeii for their initial
win of the 1936 campaign.

After losing to the Waynesburg
Yellow-jackets in the season's lid-
litter, the Mazeski crew dropped two

Panther Swimmers To Risk Victory
Streak Against Strong F & M Outﬁt

 

Increasing their victory streak to
four straight last Saturday at the ex-
pense of Penn State, the varsity nata-
_tors_ will. encounter their toughest
obstacle of the season on Saturday
when Franklin and Marshall's Eastern
Swimming Association lchampions
meet the Panthers at the Metropolitan
swimming pool. It will be the last
home meet of the season for Pitt.

F & M, well-balanced with a crew
of veterans, recently upset a strong
Penn team by a 37-34 decision and
will bring to Pittsburgh an unbeaten
record for this season on Saturday.

Headed by Oscar Foder, star splash-
er in the distance events, Whitey
Sola, Don Chalmers, and Jack Wetzel,
the visitors will probably enter the
meet in the role of favorites to hand
the Panthers their ﬁrst defeat in ﬁve
starts.

Captain Russ Lindberg will be mak-
ing his ﬁnal home performance in

 ' 775713 :5}/é*_i_.s'nw.»é'

   

People in every walk of life get
“keyed up”. . .live too hurriedly.
The effects on digestion are

this meet. He will be used in the
150-yard backstroke, 100-yard free-
style, and relay events.

Ijast seaso‘n.'the score of the Pitt-
F & M dual ended in a “take-your-
pick” result. If the relay counted
eight points, the Panthers won the
meet; if it only counted ﬁve, they
lost by one point.

The result of Saturday's engage-

ment will probably hinge upon the
number of second and third places
that either team can garner. F & M's
balanced aggregation seems to give
them an edge in this ﬁeld.

The yearling team will tangle with
Munliall high school’s outﬁt in a dual
meet on the same evening. An admis-
sion fee of 25 cents will be charged.

At the present time the Panthers
are perched on top of the Eastern
Swimming Association with two vic-
tories and no defeats.

Tip On Rushing—-
Join Intramural

Cage League Starts February 24;
Few Requisites Are Needed

I-Iere’s the tip-off. All you need is
a pair of gym-shoes, a gym suit, and a
desire to expose that Charley Hyatt
complex.

You doii’t have to belong to one of
the 13 social fraternities; you don't

have to be an Engineer; you don't
have to be a ROTC member; and you
iieedn’t be enrolled in the pre—med or
pre-dent schools.

It you carry 12 or more credits and
have the previously-meiitioned re-
quisites, get your basketball cohorts
together, run up to the Trees Gym-
nasiuni office, scribble out the
answers on an entry blank, and then
brush up on your court technique.

For you’re guaranteed a fast and
furious season of competition in a
rip—roai-ing intramural basketball
league.

Of course, if you are in the ROTC,
you have an added advantage. Perk
up your battery commander, and
make certain that he organizes a bat-
tery basketball team, so you’ll be as-
sured of a chance to play in the
ROTC league with your buddies from
other batteries as the enemy this
time.

This same advice goes for the Med-
ical and Dental school students. Get
your team organized, and we'll do the
-rest. That is, ﬁxing you up in a swift-
moving league and seeing that you
get a chance to test the hardwood of
Trees Gymnasium or the Stadium.

The whistle blows on Tuesday,
February 24, which is one week from
yesterday, so there isn't any time
left to freeze the ball. Get your teams
together, get your entry blanks, and
get ready to get going.

Women’s Choral
To Present Ballet
At Home Concert

Marion Werner To Have Leading
Vocal Role; Dancing Tryouts
Will Be Held Wednesday

 

Instead of the usual all-singing con-
cert of the Women’s Choral, this year’s
home concert will be a ballet, present-
ed by the Choral with the cooperation
of the Women’s Athletic Association.
The work to be presented is the
“Sleeping Beauty Ballet” by Tschai-
kowsky, transcribed for women’s
voices by Bornschein.

Marion Werner will be the featured
vocal soloist, and women from the
physical education department under
the direction of Miss Elizabeth C.
Rearick, assistant professor of physic-
al education, will furnish the dancing
costumes, and scenes. Tryouts for the
dancing parts will be held next Wed-
nesday afternoon a’; 3:30 o’clock at
the Physical Education Annex. Any
who cannot attend the tryouts should
communicate with Miss
Trees Gym.

Tonight members of the organiza-
tion will attend a dinner at Heinz
lHouse. Another scheduled appear-
ance of the group will be next Thurs-
day afternoon at the Board of Educa-
tion when the ‘Choral sings before the
Women's Civic League. The featured
soloist at the affair will also be Miss
Werner. The octette- will sing Shu-
b'ert’s “Hark, Hark, the Lark,” and the
entire "Choral will present early Italian
and French songs.

A concert will be held for the
Downtown Division of the University
Tuesday, March 10.

Needs For Social
Control Stressed

(Continued From Page One)
always willing to change their opin-
ions as it suits their advantage. Then,
there are the minds which are cap-
able of building up their own ideas,
which are capable of suspended judg-
ment on issues until they have sat-
isﬁed themselves that they can in
sincerity adopt a view.

According to Dr. Crane, these types
illustrate the fundamental difference
between propaganda and education.
Propaganda by means of various de-
vices—such as ﬁxation by repetition,
appeal to prejudice, or oversimpliﬁ-
cation——tries to teach people “what to
think, not how to think.”

To Dr. Crane’s mind the substitu-
tion of propaganda for education was
one of the main reasons for the rise
of dictatorships in Europe. Propa-
ganda and dictatorship,” he claims,
are “devilishly disastrous to democ-
racy.” Although there is a great deal
of propaganda in America, Dr. Crane
thinks that because the propaganda
comes from more than one source, it
tends to exert a “neutralizing force.”
It is the important function of educa-
tion that it trains the individual how
to arrive at decisions dispassionately.

Dr. Crane cited the ﬁeld of religion
as affording examples of the two prin-
ciples. Some faiths teach abject obe-
dience to conditions, holding that the
individual must endure suffering.
Christianity, on the other hand, lays
its major emphasis on the theme of
control of conditions for the better-
ment of man.
