SGB reconvenes for ﬁrst
public meeting

Megan Trimble
Staﬁ’ Writer

Student Government Board
President James Landreneau
extended a formal welcome
and wishes for a happy start to
the new school year to the 40
or so students in attendance
at Tuesday’s SGB meeting at
Nordy’s Place in the William
Pitt Union.

_“This is something that I
have been quoted saying prob-
ably a million times, but if any
of you are interested in getting
involved with SGB, there is a
spot for you,” Landreneau said.

The Board primarily ad-
dressed projects and initiatives
supported by each Board mem-
ber before doing its standard
routine of distributing funds
from the more than $2 million
Student Activities Fund.

Board member Halim Ge-
nus said he is working on a
few projects, but the issue
of marking Pitt shuttle’ stops
stands “chiefly ~ among them,”
because it’s an issue that stu-
dents have shown interest in.
Few Pitt shuttlelstops are cur-
rently marked, and Genus said
this stands as asafety issue on
campus.

“Having marked shuttle
stops helps with safety, and
it is always good to be in the
know,” he said. “If nothing
happens until I leave this seat,
I hope that when I do, that we
will have marked stops.”

Board member Julie Hal-
linan joined other Board mem-
bers in stressing the impor-

'tance of voter registration.

After asking how many mem-
bers of the public audience are

 

currently registered to vote
with a nearly unanimous show
of hands, Hallinan mentioned
a Pitt—wide initiative to install
voter registration boxes in res-
idence halls across campus.
Board members Gor-
don Louderback and Natalie
Rothenberger agreed with
Hallinan that it is an impor-
tant time for student involve-
ment in SGB and presidential
elections. They plugged their
involvements with upcoming
events to engage students in
political processes, such as
the Food Committee’s Rock the
Vote party to be held at Market
Central on Sept. 26 from 4 to 8
p.m. 7
Student Government Board

’ started the Food Committee in

2611, and it has public meet-
ings with Sodexo employees at
varying times and locations to
make comments and sugges-
tions on how to improve the
dining facilities on campus.
Sodexo, the food service
company that runs many eat-
eries on Pitt’s campus, and SGB

-are partnering to provide stu-

dents with nonpartisan infor-
mation on cadidates and reg-
ister voters before the national
voter registration deadline on
Oct. 6.

Additionally, the Food Com-
mittee will be meeting this Fri-

day at 1 p.m. at a yet—unspeci—

fied location.

Louderback said that
among the various SGB-affil-
iated committees, the Tradi-

.tions Committee was a group

that accomplished a-great deal

ELECTION 2012

First lady speaks at DNC opening

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

First Lady Michelle Obama took
the podium on the ﬁrst night of
the Democratic National Conven-
tion Tuesday in Charlotte, N.C.,
to remind voters of how much her
husband cares about the country.

“Because for Barack, it’s not
about how much money you make.
It’s about the difference you make
in people’s lives,” she said.

The ﬁrst day of the conven-
tion included dozens of speeches
from important political players
in the Democratic party, including
keynote speaker and San Antonio,
Texas, mayorjulian Castro, former
White House Chief of Staff and cur-
rent mayor of Chicago Rahm Eman-

uel and First Lady Michelle Obama.

President Barack Obama is ex-
pected to be selected for and to ac-
cept the Democratic presidential
nomination over the next two days
to face off against Republican nomi-
nee Mitt Romney in the presidential
election slated to take place Nov. 6.

Michelle Obama served as the
day’s ﬁnal speaker. She focused her
speech on her husband’s personal
character — his family history and
role as a father -— as well as his po-
litical stances on everything from
health care to the economy.

The ﬁrst lady also devoted a
portion of her oration to discuss
her husband’s position on higher
education.

“Believe it ornot, when we were
ﬁrst married, our combined month-

ly student loan bills were actually
higher than our mortgage. We were
so young, so in love, and so in debt.”
she said. “That’s why Barack has
fought so hard to.increase student
aid and keep interest rates down,
because he wants every young
person to fulﬁll their promise and
be able to attend college without a
mountain of debt.”

The ﬁrst lady concluded the ﬁ-
nal speech of day one with a simple
directive.

“We must once again come to-
gether and stand together for the
man we can trust to keep moving
this great country forward — my
husband, our president, President
Barack Obama.”

fiitt, Port Auth

ority continue

. .,»%q,

negotiations for U-Pass program

Gwenn Barney
Assistanzf News Editor

Pitt and Port Authority agreed
on Friday to extend the U—Pass
program — which allows about
40,000 students and employees
to ride public buses using their
Pitt IDs — for one month, while
the two sides hash out a longer-
term deal.

This is the second time the
University and Port Authority
have agreed to an extension to
continue negotiations since the
ﬁve-year contract expired at the
end of July. Under the ﬁve—year
contract, the University pays
$6.8 million for ﬁscal year 2012 .

in exchange for the fare—free

rides on Port Authority buses.
In recent years, the Port Au-

thority has faced cuts to its state

. appropriation. Most recently it

had to ﬁnd ways to cope with a
$64 million deﬁcit in the 2012-
2013 operating budget. _ The
transportation organization was
able to prevent cuts to its services
this year by ﬁnding other revenue
streams besides the state gov-
ernment. However, similar past
deﬁcits since Pitt signed the most
recent U—Pass contract in 2007
led to to a 15 percent reduction in
Port Authority services in March
2011.Pitt is in discussion with the
organization to determine how
much it should continue to pay

for the Port Authority’s services
in light of these service cuts.

“We continue talking with the
University and recently extended
our agreement for another 30
days — through September,” Port
Authority spokesmanjim Ritchie
said in an email. “Students and
any other Pitt ID holder may con-
tinue using their IDs to ride Port
Authority vehicles while negotia-
tions continue.”

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
said Pitt would like to renew the
contract. a

“The arrangement has been

beneﬁcial to both sides, and, as ’

evidenced by the continued ne-
gotiations, is one that we’d like
to continue,” he said. ‘

 

Correction: In yesterday’s story, “Undergraduates play signiﬁcant role in lab studying muscle atrophy,” we
incorrectly spelled the name of professor Lewis Jacobson. The Pitt News regrets the error.

DNC

In the keynote address last
night, Castro emphasized President
Obama’s connection to the middle
class, what he called “the engine of
our economic road.”

He described this as a connec-
tion the Republican party doesn’t
share. . ,

“Mitt Romney, quite simply,
doesn’t get it,” he said. “A few
months ago, he visited a univer-
sity in Ohio and gave the students

‘there a little entrepreneurial ad-
vice. ‘Start a business,’ he said. But
how? ‘Borrow money if you have to
from your parents,’ he told them.
Gee — why didn’t I think of that?”

Rahm Emanuel preceded the
ﬁrst lady’s speech. He spent a sig-
niﬁcant portion of his offering de-
scribing Barack Obama’s efforts to
resurrect the auto industry, bring-
ing the president’s opponent in the
upcoming election into the discus-
sion.

 

“Where Mitt Romney was will-
ing to turn his back on Akron, Day-
ton and Toledo, Ohio, the president
said, ‘I’ve got your back,”’ he said.

Emanuel also presented to the
audience President Obama’s work
to bring home American troops in
Iraqand his “Race to the Top” -ini-
tiative for school reform as more
of the president’s achievements.

He punctuated his recounting
of each of the president’s accom-
plishments in office with the saying,
“That was the change we believed

- in. That was the change we fought »

for. That was the change President
Obama delivered.”

On Wednesday, delegates from
across the U.S. and their related
districts and territories will ofﬁ—
cially vote for which candidate they
would like to represent the Demo-
cratic party in the upcoming elec-
tion. A candidate must earn 2,778

‘votes to be declared the party can-
didate. Running unopposed in most
states, Barack Obama is expected
to handily win the necessary votes.

SGB

over the summer. After a subdued refer-
ence to the football team’s home opener
and loss on Saturday, Louderback ap-
plauded the newly reinstated Panther
Pitt student section.

“This is something

that I have been  
quoted saying

probably a million

” times, but if any of

you are interested

in getting involved

with SGB, there is
a spot for you.”
James Landreneau

“Hey, we were the most talked about
thing on Twitter for a half hour,” he
said. _

Board member Megan McGrath
urged students to alleviate, the stresses
of long lines located outside of Heinz
Field’s Gate C after Panther football
games by going to the less-populated
bus pickup location alongside the exit
facing Stage AE.

Keeping with- the promotion of easy
transportation, McGrath referenced

‘ the Bike Rental System and the conve-

niences that it can afford students.
“[The program] is something that
I’ve been working on since last semes-

ter, and I am in discussions to get that

system up and running,” McGrath said.
“Students will be able to rent a bike for
the day and take a nice trip to South
Side or other areas, if they would like.”

Allocations

Club Tennis requested $1,021.36 for
lodging and travel expenses to compete
in a competition. The Board approved
the request in full in line with the Allo-
cations recommendation.

Engineers for a Sustainable World
requested $2,694.80 for registration,
flight and hotel room expenses. Alloca-
tions recommended the denial of one
flight cost and three registration fees to
put the allocation of funds beneath the
$2,000 conference cap in line with Al-
locations precedence. The Board moved
to fund all four registrations and break
the suggested cap. The Board approved

Club Tennis requested $656.94 for

spending. ‘ -

Pitt Rowing requested $7,425 for

tions recommendation to not fund for a

Cyberstalking and

social networking:

Why Foursquare might enable creepiness

Jonathan Fischer
Columnist

Equipped with only a smartphone
and an increasingly popular social
networking application, I might be
your new accidental cyberstalker.

I claim to be accidental because
I don’t really know a thing about
proper stalking -— let alone cy-
berstalking. I really didn’t mean to
acquire your information, but you

made it all too easy for anyone to '

see. With the success of mobile ap-
plications like Foursquare, society
is sacriﬁcing personal privacy for
entertaimnent, and it is not in our
best interest. ‘

For example, consider the fol-
lowing hypothetical situation.
Amanda has pearly whites, long
brown hair (with a hint of red),
black glasses and is probably
around my age, judging from the
single picture on my iPhone. She
has excellent taste in drinks, as
I'also enjoy vanilla lattes in the
morning before heading off to
work. Or in Amanda’s case, the
nearby college. Oh, I almost ne-
glected to mention that she’s here

-in Starbucks, enjoying that very
beverage at this moment within
the same vicinity as me.

I’ve never met Amanda, but
Foursquare has.

If you have an iPhone or an
Android mobile device, your cell
phone is a geo-locating device that
can pinpoint your location within
100 meters. Combine thistech-
nology with an app that helps you
connect and communicate with
others, and you’ve got a recipe that
satisfies even the most curious so-
cial creatures in_ the world. It just

so happens that people tend to be
a pretty curious bunch.

Foursquare happens to be
free and easily accessible in the
Apple and Android app stores.
The app’s main niche includes its
“check—in” feature, which allows a
user to share their location (and a
lot more) with friends and other
Foursquare users. These users can
include complete strangers. Users
are encouraged to check-in fre-
quently, supposedly to ﬁnd other
friends in the area, and even earn
badges and points as a way to com-
pete over certain locations.

So how did I know so much
about Amanda using Foursquare?

Amanda happened to be the

Mayor of a local Starbucks, with
the greatest number of check—ins
at the establishment over a cer-'

tain period of time. We happened
to check-in around the same time.
Foursquare notiﬁed me that “The
Mayor is in the house!” and gave
me the option to click on Mayor
Amanda. Did I mention that you
receive bonus points when you
check-in at a location where the
Mayor is present? You can even
earn a free cup of coffee when
showing the cashier of the Star-
bucks that you are the Mayor. How
entertaining is that?

It could potentially be enter-
taining, .but having this informa-
tion so easily accessible is abso-
lutely terrifying.

Myspace, Facebook and Twit-
ter all come from similar roots,
which involve acquiring friends
and posting comments for said
friends. Take these popular trends
and add geo—location technology

with an app as innocent sounding I

as your favorite childhood past-
time game, and the end result is a
powerful and potentially danger-
ous stalking tool.

Our generation of Amandas
needs to realize that this type of
technology demands a certain

' level of responsibility to keep our

own information private. Stalking
experts say the rapid evolution in
geo—location technology has in-
creased the risks of exposing pri-
vate information. “It doesn’t cause
stalking, but it makes stalking a lot
easier,” says Rebecca Dreke, a se-
nior analyst at the National Center
for Victims of Crime. Let’s take a
step back before we rush into the
next information-grabbing social
networking trend for the sake of
entertainment.

I have had more friends on
‘Foursquare than I care to admit,
and the trend of people connect-
ing on the app continues to grow
at alarming? rates. Legislation has
a hard time keeping up with new
technology laws pertaining to pri-
vate information. Words like “gov—
emmen ” and “protecting priva-
cy” aren’t often used in the same
sentence. For the time being, it’s
up to you, Amanda and me to pro-
tect our own private information.

Because I am capable of face-to-
face and voice-to—voice communi-
cation, I don’t have a pressing need
to give out my current location or
private’ information , or to down-
load the latest social craze for the
sole purpose of entertainment val-
ue. Today was the day I decided not
to check-in anymore when I drove
into my parking garage.

,,VOLLEYBALL '

Volleyball team 4 sweeps home to

Torie Wytiaz '
Staff Writer

The home-court advantage seemed
to work for the Panthers this week-
end as the Pitt women’s volleyball
team compiled a set record of 9-0
to win the Panther Invitational held
at the Fitzgerald Field House.

The Panthers hosted Coastal
Carolina, Howard and Butler uni-
versities on Friday and Saturday,
defeating each opponent in three
straight sets. Sophomore setter

_,Lindsey Zitzke and senior outside
hitter Alexa Campbell were named
to the All—Toumament team, while
senior middle blockerjasmine Dit-
trich was named MVP of the week-
end.

Pitt 3, Coastal Carolina 0

In their opening match of the
tournament, the Panthers faced
the Chanticleers of Coastal Carolina
and swept the match with set scores

P

of 25-20, 25-11 and 25-23.

Offensively, the Panthers put to-
gether a balanced attack with four
players recording at least six kills.
Dittrich led the way with nine kills.
On defense, senior libero Margy
Acton paced the team with her
match-high nine digs.

The Panthers fell behind early

in the ﬁrst set as the Chanticleers ‘

built an 8-5 advantage, but six kills
by Dittrich helped the team regain
the lead. For Pitt head coach Toby
Rens, this ability to recover was
vital in the match.

“For the team aspect, I thought
we did an excellent job of execut-
ing our game plan and keeping our

composure,” Rens said. “We were .

able to focus on ourown game.”

While the Panthers never trailed
in the second set, the third and ﬁ-
nal set saw 11 ties and three lead
changes. With the score knotted at
23, the Panthers capitalized on two
Coastal Carolina errors to take the
set and the match victory.

P RT

Pitt 3, Howard 0

During the second match of the
invitational, Rens was able to shuf-
ﬂe the rotation and give younger
players the opportunity to gain on-
court experience.

“We were able to get a good look
at some of our players who haven’t
had a chance to prove themselves,”
Rens said. “I was impressed with
their efforts and the leadership they
showed on the court.”

Pitt comfortably defeated How-
ard in three sets with scores of
25-12, 25-11 and 25-20, and fresh-
man Amanda Orchard recorded a
career-high seven kills.

“Amanda did a great job in her
ﬁrst all—around appearance,”-Rens
said. “Her performance shows that
we have a lot of depth on this team.”

Zitzke agreed with Rens’ assess-

I ment and noted that the Pitt team

members are always prepared to
compete.
“We have a competitive edge, no

urnament over the Weekend

matter who is on the court,” Zitzke
said. “Anyone on this team can step
into the lineup and contribute, be-
cause we practice that every week.”

The keys to the Panthers’ domi-
nance against Howard were serving

' and serve-reception defense. The

Panthers tallied 10 service aces,
while holding Howard to zero.

WOMEN’S SOCCER

Winning streak snapped as

Donnie Tasser
Staff Writer _

The Pitt women’s soccer team
entered the West Virginia Uni-
versity 90 Minute Classic coming

F off its best start in three seasons.

'\

&But a couple of close defeats at
the hands of quality opponents
shocked the Panthers this week-
end.

Going into the tournament,
the team knew the sort of talent

it would face, according to head
_coach Greg Miller.

“Our schedule was not easy,
but a bit easier [earlier in the sea-
son], and our objective was to get
as many wins as possible,” Miller
said. “These last two games were
a lot tougher.”

Pitt (4-3) entered the tourna-
ment having already won twice as

many games this season as they =

did all of last season, averaging
1.8 goals per game and conceding

' ‘an average of 1.0 per game. Both

of these statistics show a vast
improvement from last season’s
performance, in which the team
scored an average of .74 goals

per game and gave up 2.42. But
the Panthers were shut out twice
in a 1-0 overtime loss to the Uni-
versity of Miami, and a 3-0 defeat

at the hands of the tournament

champions, No. 3 Penn State.
Miami 1, Pitt 0

The Hurricanes opened the
season ranked in the top 25
teams in the country, but started
the season slowly and began the
WVU tournament with a record
of 2-2. Both teams had several ex-
cellent scoring chances that were
stiﬂed by superb performances
from both teams’ goalkeep-
ers, who kept the score at 0-0
through regulation.

Miller praised redshirt sopho-
more keeper Nicole D’Agostino
— who tied a career- and season-
high record with 9 saves in the
game —- and her teammates for
adjusting after a rough start.

“[We] started shaky, and Ni-
cole had to make some big-time
saves in the ﬁrst 5-10 minutes. to
bail us out,” Miller said. “Then we

Panthers drop

settled down and started to play
and create chances.” ‘
The chances continued
throughout the 30-minute over-
time period. Pitt’s Morgan Shar-
ick, a junior defender who leads
the team with three goals this
season, nearly‘ put the game
away just ﬁve minutes into extra
time when she redirected a cor-
ner kick with a header. The shot,
which has become a specialty for
the Panthers and Sharick this
season (all three of her goals have
been scored this way), was acci-
dentally blocked by a Pitt player.
Sharick’s ability on both sides
of the ball made her a weapon in
both games of the tournament.
“Morgan had a very good

weekend,” Miller said. “There

was a lot of pressure put on our
back line, and she did a great
job organizing and keeping ev-
erything contained. She is also a
huge threat on set pieces because
of her ability in the air.”

Miami scored ﬁve minutes
after Pitt’s botched chance off
a shot from outside the penalty

pairof weekend opponents

area: the result of a poor clear-
ance from a Hurricane corner
kick. . »

“We didn’t get enough pres-

’ sure [on the initial ball in]. The

goalie was screened a- little bit,
and she threw it at the net,”Mill-
er said. “And that was that.”
Penn State 3, Pitt 0

Coming into the tournament

as one of the best teams in the ~

nation, the Nittany Lions — de-
spite a gutsy performance by Pitt
— showed how much ability they
have. Penn State struck early,‘
taking a 1-0 lead just eight min-
utes into the game and a 2-0 lead
three minutes before the half.

-“We were playing a much
more talented team, a [probable]
Final Four team, in my opinion,”
Miller said. “We had to make
some tactical adjustments to try
and compete with them.”

Pitt then fell into a 3-0 hole
early in the second half. Despite
outshooting the Nittany Lions
6-3 in the second frame, the

Panthers were unable to‘ break
throughfor a goal. A
“[PSU] started to take their
foot off the gas pedal, pulling
some players and not playing as
aggressively,” Miller said. “We
kept up the pressure and had

-some great chances. If we would

have converted, it would have
made the game very interesting,
but we just weren’t able to capi-

Both teams registered 10
shots on the day, with Penn State

» putting 6 on goal and the Pan-

thers putting 4..

Miller remains unfazed fol-
lowing the losses and insists
that the team’s goals have not
changed. H

“We set up the nonconference
schedule like this for a reason,”
he said. “It shows us where we
are. We need to tweak a bit, but I
think we are just about ready for
our conference opener next week
against Marquette.”

Column: Keys to becoming
a full-blown Steelers fan

Donnie Tasser
Staff Wrz'ter

In good 01’ western Pennsylvania, that spe-

cial time when the leaves change colors, ,

the summer sun decides to hide and school
starts is not known as “football season.”
Since the Pittsburgh Steelers are the only
team in all of history worth rooting for, fall
is known as “Steelers~season.” And since
you now live alongside all the wonderful
yinzers in “Steelers Country,” you better
act the part, because we don’t take kindly to
those funny—looking people who walk around
with .purple—and-black or green—and-silver
birds on their shirts. So I will attempt to
acclimate you foreigners to the intricacies
of being a fan of the Steelers, the greatest
team on Earth, in Pittsburgh, the greatest
city on Earth.*

1. You must always wear your Steelers
jersey, no matter where you are. A

a stand—up comedy act at Improv on the
Waterfront where Australian comedianjim
Jefferies called the audience “scumbags” be-
cause of the high number of Steelers jerseys
in the crowd. Obviously, scumbag must mean
“pretty awesome” in that crazy Australian
slang. If for some reason I’m mistaken, then
Jefferies is obviously jealous that he doesn’t
have six Super Bowl trophies.

2. You must always have your “Terrible
Towel” at the ready.

just for a moment, imagine what would
happen if you found out that Mike Wallace
scored a touchdown in a 7—on-7 drill, and
you didn’t have your Terrible Towel to swing

’ violently above your. head while screaming
‘ in celebration. That would be pretty disap-

pointing, wouldn’t it? How would anybody
around you know that something awesome
just happened? Or worse, how would they
know that you are a die-hard supporter of

For Dittrich, the strength of the Pitt team

against Howard was evident in the options
created offensively.

“We were able to remain focused and get
the passes to Lindsey [Zitzke] ,” Dittrich said.
“With good defense comes good offense, and
we were able to consistently have all three
hitting options available, which kept Howard
on the defensive.”

Pitt 3, Butler 0

The ﬁnal contest of the tournament
proved to be the toughest challenge for the
Panthers, but they anticipated that difﬁculty
going into the match.

“Butler is an experienced team, returning
four starters from a successful team last year,”
Rens said before the match. “We anticipate
a competitive match against the Bulldogs.”

The Panthers jumped out to an early 4-go
lead in the ﬁrst set and never gave up that

» lead en route to a 25-17 set victory; Pitt had

the advantage for most of the second set as
well, but Butler managed to tie the score
at 24. An ace by sophomore libero Delaney
Clesen put the Panthers ahead, and the set
ended on a Butler attack error.

Once again, the third set was the most
contested of the match.

After battling to a 25-25 tie, three kills
by Campbell sealed the win and earned the
Panthers top honors in their own invitational.

In evaluating the weekend’s performance,
Rens was able to recognize his team’s mental

. focus.

“I was extremely pleased with the total
team effort from start to ﬁnish this weekend,”
Rens said. “Friday night we showed heart
[against Coastal Carolina], and I was pleased
with our execution. Against Butler, we battled

and it is great that we did not drop a set the _

entire weekend.”

The Panthers will travel next to New Or-
leans to compete in the Allstate Sugar Bowl
Collegiate Classic next weekend. As part of
the tournament, they will face Tulane, Sam
Houston State and Mississippi State uni-
versities. 3

how else could you ever display how blue
collaf you are if you couldn’t force down
the heinous brew that the men of the steel
mills and coal mines drank every dayof their
lives? You couldn’t —— not even if you were
wearing your Ben Roethlisberger jersey with
a Steelers faux mining hardhat on your head
whilé swinging your Terrible Towel in the air.
4. Youmust publicly acknowledge how
great and widespread our fan base is.
Someone once told me, “I didn’t think
that anybody even rooted for those oth-
er teams. I just thought everybody was a
Steelers fan.” That’s the exact attitude we’re
looking for. There are Pittsburgh Steelers-
themed bars all across America. That’s how
much everybody loves our team. Few people
actually hate them, I’m pretty sure. Those
that do, well, they’re just jealous that they

.aren’t: blue—collar like us. And they don’t

have six Super Bowl wins either.

5-{You must remind everybody you see
that the Pittsburgh Steelers have won six
Super Bowls.

This is the most important partof your
fandom. The rest of the National Football
League, as well as those weirdos who don’t
wear their Steelers jerseys all the time, can-

not forget that the greatest team on earth, ‘

a.k.a. the Pittsburgh Steelersyhave won six
Super Bowl Championships. Whatewould
happen if the rest of the country forgot to
pay its respects to the “City of Champions?”

Now go, young padawan, and use your
newfound Yinzer knowledge to force down
Iron City and wave your Terrible Towel dur-
ing Steelers games all season here in Steel-
ers Country. If you should refuse your new
duties, then you are obviously jealous that
your team didn’t win six Super Bowls.
