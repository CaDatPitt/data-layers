  Religion

plays role
in voting

When it comes to winning the White
House, public ‘perception of individ-
ual religious beliefs can prove a major
obstacle for candidates to overcome.

Presidents as far back as Thomas
Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Wil-
liam Howard Taft have faced negative
attention during elections because
of their perceived beliefs —— or the
lack of them. According to Harvard
University religious studies professor
Bronwyn Roantree, allthree were ac-
cused of atheism — a serious social
misstep at their times.

Such difﬁculties persistfor candi-
dates today. Roantree explained that
rumors claiming President Barack
Obama was Muslim “dogged” him
during the 2008 election. Similarly,
while campaigning in 2007, current
Republican presidential nominee
Mitt Romney faced criticism for his
Mormon faith.

While Obama and Romney have
undergone disparagement in the past
because of the public perception of
their religious beliefs, their faiths
might have played less of a primary
role in this election. But religious dif-
ferences continue to present issues
through which candidates and voters
alike ﬁnd grounds for disagreement.

“The candidate’s religion does
matter,” Roantree said in an email,
“though only to a certain extent.
Throughout American history, can-
didates have used their opponent’s
religious faith ——- or lack thereof —

SOU'I‘I-I BEND, Ind. — Ray Graham
burst through a blob of golden hel-
mets and suddenly had nothing but
grass and a set of uprights opposing
him.

Eighty-seven yards never seemed
so long a distance.

During its ﬁrst offensive play of
the game Saturday afternoon, Pitt
looked as if it were on its way to sur-
prisingthe more than 80,000 people
in attendance at Notre Dame Stadium
by taking an early lead against the No.
3 team in the nation.

Graham, a year removed from an
ACL tear, crossed the midﬁeld ahead
of everyone, but somehow, Irish de-

fenders made up the seemingly insur-
mountable gap between themselves
and the ball carrier, wrestling the
senior running back to the ground
on the 32-yard line. And in doing so,
the Irish contained the damage to
55 yards.

Opportunity squandered.

Pitt managed no better than a 39-
yard ﬁeld goal on that drive, tyingthe
game when it could’ve taken the lead.

That play foreshadowed what
would unfold in the next four hours
as Pitt surprisingly stayed with one of
the nation’s best teams, only to lose
right at the end. _

V “I think that’s one thing that we
do: play to our opponent’s level,” Gra-
ham said after the game. “We gotta
just play our game every time we step
on the ﬁeld.”

The Panthers (4-5, 1-3 Big East)
blew a 14-point lead going into the
fourth quarter against undefeated
Notre Dame (9-0), losing 29-26 in
triple overtime during one of the
most memorable Pitt football games
in recent history. Pitt was close to a
historic win against the Irish, who
have been included in the discus-
sion regarding teams vying for the
national title.

Pitt’s defense allowed 145 yards on
two long drives in the opening period

I of play, embodying the expression

“bending but not breaking” and hold-
ing Irish offense —— the same offense
that hung30 points in avvin onthen—

ELECTION 2012  I "   
Candidates vie for House, Senate seats on Election Day

Pat Mczxteer
Assz'stant’Ne.ws’Edz'tor

Though most eyes are on the presidential elections tomorrow, several other national elections for House and Senate positions promise tight races with important repercussions. 

g . _ PA Senatorial Race

This year’s election pits Democrat incumbent Bob Casey against Tea Party contender Tom Smith.

Casey is relatively conservative for a,Democr_at in regard to his social views, holding a pro-life stance and
supporting civil unions for gay individuals instead of marriage.‘But Casey is more liberal in his ﬁscal policy,
promoting increased taxation and supporting the Affordable Care Act. By contrast, Smith is conservative
in both his social and ﬁscal policy, opposing taxation and the Affordable Care Act. -

In recent days, the race has turned into a debate over where Casey’s environmental policy stands. Smith
has put out a series of ads that accuse Casey of supportingObama’s environmental regulations that will
have a negative effect on the coal mining industry. In return, Casey has put out ads of his own, vouching
his support for coal miners. ‘ S

Casey’s lead chipped away between September, when Casey held a 15-point lead in the RealClearPolitics.

PA-12 1

Encompassing portions ofAl1egheny, Westrnoreland, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Somerset and Washington Counties,
Pennsylvania’s Twelfth Congressional District is rela11'vely moderate in terms of voting history. Voters in the district
historically favor candidates who are pro-life and against gun control. A

The latest House election features incumbent Rep. Mark Critz, D-Cambria, facing businessman Keith Rothﬁis
in what has become one of the most tightly contested and nationally publicized contests in the nation. The race for
PA-12 is now the country’s leader in outside spending for a House race. According to the Sunlight Foundation, both
sides have poured $9.7 million into the race total. ' A

One of the main points of contention between the two candidates has been the protection of Medicare, a popular
program among citizens over the age of 65. This voting group makes up 14.5 percent of PA-12’s population.

Rothfus has attacked Critz for supporting President Barack Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,
which he argues removes more than $700 billion from Medicare to pay for Obama’s health care plan. A

In turn, Critz says Rothfus’ support of Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan’s “Path to Prosperity”
budget plan indicates his opposition to Medicare because the budget similarly removes more than $700 billion from
M ark C ritz the program and transforms it into a voucher system. Keith Rothfus

Typically, national polling ﬁrms don’t survey for House elections, so the only indicator of public sentiments to- V

ward the election come from the candidates’ internal polls. But these polls are crafted by the campaigns to promote
ﬁmdraising and mobilize supporters, so their results are considered inconclusive.

   

PA-14

Rep. Mike Doyle, D—A1legheny, has held the PA-14 House seat since 1995. And observers of the race be-
tween him and Pittsburgh optometrist Hans Lessmann say Doyle won’t need to search throughlhelp wanted
advertisements Wednesday morning. " H

Because the district is urban and labor-heavy, it’s considered a Democratic stronghold in southwestern
Pennsylvania.

Doyle, a frequent guest of Pitt’s College Democrats, has received support from his constituents for pro-
posing health reform laws as well as legislation favoring domestic energy. .

PA-18
Former Washington County Commissioner Larry Maggi’s challenge against incumbent Rep. Tim Murphy,
R-Westmoreland, began promisingly. By mid—July, Maggi had surpassed all of Murphy’s previous challengers
in ﬁmdraising numbers, bringing in $203,000. «
But with an advertising campaign based on connecting Maggi to Obama’s energy policies, which Murphy
has called a “war on coal,” the four-term congressman appears to have placed some distance between himself
and his challenger. »
‘V   _v Unlike most Republicans, Murphy publicly supports labor unions, which has endeared him to voters in
 ‘ ‘ PA—18, an area that encompasses parts of Westmoreland, Allegheny and Washington Counties. Murphy, who
Larry Maggi received his doctorate from Pitt and was formerly an assistant professor of psychology, has been a ﬁerce 
opponent of Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Tim Murphy

The three men were not arrested,
but will receive summonses to ap-

hearing. .

According to police documents,
Karl Olsheski, who ﬁled the criminal
complaint, was walking with two
women, Diana Olsheski and Saman-
tha Mitchell, on Oakland Avenue the
night following the Buffalo game.
The complaint stated that Karl Ol-
sheski, Diana Olsheski and Mitchell
tried to pass a group of men dressed
in Pitt football gear on the sidewalk
when a confrontation occurred.

Both Olsheskis and Mitchell are
Pitt students.

According to the criminal com-
plaint, Graham asked, “What up,”

  

Devin Street

with a racial epithet to Karl Olsh-
eski, who responded, “Nothing,” and
tried to continue walking away. But
Graham blocked his path and Street
stood directly in front of him. 01-
sheski tried backing away, but Pitts
blocked his path.

Karl Olsheski told police that
shortly after this verbal exchange,
Street struck him in the left side of
his head. Upon arrival, police asked
Karl Olsheski if he required medical
attention, but he said his “clavicle
[was] ﬁne.”

Police presented Karl Olsheski,

’ Diana Olsheski and Mitchell with an

array of Pitt football team members’
photographs to have them identify
the alleged suspects. Diana Olsheski
identiﬁed Graham and toldpolice
that he was a well-known ﬁgure on

Lafayette Pitts

Pitt’s campus. She also positively
identiﬁed Pitts, telling police she
recognized him from an African-
American dance class she shares
with him.

The criminal complaint states
that Karl Olsheski corroborated Di-
ana Olsheski’s positive identiﬁcation
of Graham.

‘ After police showed the same ar-
ray of photographs to Mitchell, she
positively identiﬁed Street, saying
that he shared a class on vampires
with her last spring.

Annual concert shines if

spotlight on azz music

F or The Pitt News

Celebrated jazz bassist Abraham La-
boriel danced across the stage with
his bass, exciting the crowd into hol-
lers and applause at the concluding
event of Pitt’s week-long Annual
Jazz Seminar and Concert this past
Saturday.

After accepting the Lifetime
Achievement Award at the concert,
Laboriel expressed his gratitude to-
ward Pitt for maintaining and sus-
taining the world of jazz and mak-
ing jazz something that is both valid
and lasting. The crowd at Oakland’s
Carnegie Music Hall was anything
but quiet for the 42nd installment of
the annual event, which has hosted
such jazz greats as Art Blakey, Clark
Terry and Dizzy Gillespie over the
years.

‘jazz is a form of art that was
born in this country and is treasured
throughout the whole world,” La-
Boriel said.

Cheers and applause for the mu-
sicians continued throughout the
hour and a half of music. If a musi-
cian added some extra ﬂair to his
playing, such as holding a long note
or dancing to the music, the audi-
ence would notice and cheer with
applause. Audience members con-
tinued to bob and tap their feet to
the music throughout the duration
of the concert.

Nathan Davis, Pitt’s director of
jazz studies and the founder of the

Pittjazz Seminar and Concert, gath-
ers the world’s top jazz performers
every year for one week to give lec-
tures and perform for the Pittsburgh
community.

“Over the years we’ve had more
innovators here than any school in
the world. It’s a who’s who in the his-
tory of jazz,” Davis said, referencing
the past appearances of Blakey, Terry
and Gillespie.

All preparations for the event,
including writing the music, book-
ing the musicians and creating the
programs, was all done by Davis, who
started composingthe theme for the
largely improvisational concert in
September and tried to have all of
the musicians booked byjuly.

According to Davis, some people
think the autumnal event at Pitt is
the most important jazz concert of
the year.

“It brings the community togeth-
er,” David said. “The whole week is
very involved with the community.”

Before meeting for the week-
ending concert, the musicians gave
seminars throughout the week at
universities, schools, veteran cen-
ters and senior centers. .

RELIGION

to imply that they are not ﬁt to be
presiden ”

But Bucknell University assis-
tant professor of religion Brantley
Gasaway said he feels that, because
Obama and Romney have been criti-
cized in the past as a result of their
religious views, both have avoided
talking aboutthe issue throughout
the course of this election.

“Religious identiﬁcation has not
been a big factor in this year’s elec-
tion,” Gasaway said. “Both have
something to lose by talking about
it. They are open to similar critiques.”

Roantree agrees that the religion
of the candidates hasn’t been a signiﬁ-
cant issue in this year’s election, but
she also believes the fact that it isn’t
being talked about has the potential
to harm each candidate’s standing.
Because Romney is remaining largely
silent about his religion, his Mormon
faith can be perceived as possibly det-
rimental to his campaign.

“The campaign’s careful treat-
ment of Romney’s religious belief
reveals that his faith, while not an
outright  is also not his great-
est asset,” Roantree said.

Meanwhile, persistent rumors
surrounding Obama’s beliefs might
have affected his campaign, too, Ro-
antree said. .

“The caveat to that is that the ru-

— mors that Obama is ‘really’ a Muslim

have persisted in some quarters and
may make voters who remain uneasy
about Mormonism more sympathetic
to Romney than they may otherwise
have been,” Roantree said.

Some local voters are bucking this
supposed trend.

Kathy Anders, a 68-year-old di-
rector of food services at Carlow Uni-
versity and a member of the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
supports Barack Obamainthisyear’s
election even though Mitt Romney
is a Mormon like herself. She said
she feels that it’s “difficult” for her
to determine whether her religious
beliefs affect her political views. Al-
though she would lil<e the president

to be Christian, she believes it’s im-
portant that the president is a man
of the people.

“He has to have a good heart and
think of the people,” Anders said.

I Susan Custer, another member of
the Latter—day Saints and a 42-year-
old Republican and mother, said that
although she does plan to vote for
Romney in this year’s election, her
decisionwasn’t religiously motivated.
Custer said she doesn’t describe her-
self as a Romney supporter; instead,
she is voting for the former Massa-
chusetts governor because she is a
Republican.

“I’m voting for him because I’m
not voting for Obama,” Custer said.

Otherthanin the case of abortion,
which she opposes, Custer said she
generally doesn’t mix her faith with
her political views. She deﬁnes a good
president as an honest person who
doesn’t abuse “national trust.”

Although she “doesn’t know what
Romney is going to be like,” Custer
said Obama hasn’t ﬁt her description
of a good president.

“Obama hasn’t been honest,”

she said. “He has overused taxpayer
money.”

For others, however, religion plays
a more deﬁnitive role in political de-
cisions.

Matt Blumhard, a Pitt under-
graduate and president of the student
organization Christian Cornerstone
Ministry, grew up an atheist. Al-
though he originally leaned toward
the conservative side of the politi-
cal spectrum, he changed his focus
from partisanship to religion when
he converted to Christianity.

“Meetingjesus changed a lot of
things in my life, and the way I ap-
proach politics is one of those things,”
Blumhard said. “Rather than looking
at politics from aself-interested point
of view, the motivation became how
do I love God and love people through
politics?”

Blumhard doesn’t support either
presidential candidate in the 2012
election because “neither of them
entirely reﬂects” what he looks for
in a president.

Blumhard believes that the solu-
tion to these problems is a relation-

ship withjesus and Scripture, which
he feels neither Obama nor Romney
possesses.

“I think a president is going to be
able to best love and serve his nation
when he is connected withjesus, but
does that mean that only Christians
will be effective leaders? No. In fact,
I think most of our past presidents
have not really reﬂected that Chris-
tian worldview,” Blumhard said.

Jonathan Lippert, an undergradu-
ate student and vice president of the
student—run Catholic Newman Club,
also said his religious beliefs affect
his political views. Like Blumhard, he
supports neither Obama nor Romney
inthe upcoming election. Lippert has
a list of ﬁve “non-negotiable issues”
that a candidate must oppose to win
his vote: abortion, euthanasia, em-
bryonic stem-cell research, human
cloning and homosexual marriage.
Lippert said he is opposed to these
issues because he views them as a vio-
lation ofhuman rights that should be
protected.

“These issues are intrinsic evils

that the Bible and Church teachings deﬁne,”
Lippert said.

Lippert said he is strict in his religious and
political outlook and strives not to be a “cafete-
ria Catholic,” a term used to refer to members
of the Catholic Church who pick and choose
their beliefs rather than align themselves with
all church teachings. Lippert feels that, as a
Catholic, there are certain moral principles he
needs to align himself with.

But not every student’s political views are
dictated by religious affiliations.

Sherean Ali, a member of the Muslim Stu-
dents Association, plans to vote for Obama in

this year’s election, and she doesn’t believe that
her religious views affect her political outlook.
To her, the two are completely separate.

“My religious beliefs, regardless ofwhat they
are, I do not feel impact my decision,” Ali said.
“Although there may be certain beliefs of any
religion that Romney or Obama may violate, I
do not think that gravitates my decision.”

Ali said she supports Obamafora numberof .

Obama will accomplishxmore in equalizing
women’s pay in the next four years. Lastly, Ali
said she believes Obama is a “man ofhis wor ,”
asigniﬁcant characteristic that she looks for in
any president. T

“For me, a president should not only be a

   

good leader who represents their given nation,
but also tries to remain as true to their word
as possible,” Ali said. “[Obama] not only cares
about the lives of Americans, but also of those
living elsewhere.”

AlthoughAli doesn’t support Rorrmey in this
year’s election, it isn’t because of his Mormon
 Rather, she commends Romney for be-

.  a Mormon candidate because she feels it
reasons. Not only does she feel that the presi- -. ' n
dent’s higher education initiatives will helpher _
more than Romney’s, she also believes that ‘

 United States is. In addition, Ali doesn’t

place emphasis on a candidate’s religion when
deciding whom to support. Instead, she wants
the most-qualiﬁed person to be elected.

“As Americans, we all want the best man or

religion that president may be does not deter
our support,” Ali said.

Like Ali, Noah Tankin, aJewish student,
supports Obama in this year’s election. Tankin
doesn’t believe his Jewish faith has a strong
direct effect on his political views, but he noted
that the two do overlap. According to Tankin,
taking care of others is an important part of the

Jewish community, and he said that value can
be seen in anumber of policies that Democrats
support. *

“Being Jewish, taking care of others is a
strong part of our community,” Tankin said.
“This is done through social security and other
programs that Obama supports.”

Tankin doesn’t support Romney because of
his “strongtalkof a Christian nation.” Such rhet-
oric concerns Tankin as aJewish student, and
he said it has veered him away from Romney.

But even though Tankin doesn’tplan onvot-
ingfor Romney, he doesn’t feel that a president’s
religious afﬁliation should matter.

“I strongly believe in the separation of

or Quran, it shouldn’t decide policy,” Tankin
said. “It’s all about what the people want.” I

DEBATE

 

Is one presidential candidate better
than the other for the economy?

Nick Stamatakis and Daniel Okwaisie
Columnists

Many people are skeptical ofa
president’s ability to change‘the
direction of the economy. ‘What
are some of the diﬁerences be-
tween President Barack Obama
and Republican presidential
nominee Mitt Romney that might
make a difference in improv-
ing economic conditions? Nick
Stamatakis and Daniel Okwaisie
discuss. * 

NS: One reason why the eco-
nomic recovery has been weak
is regulatory uncertainty. As
boring as it sounds, the presi-
dent’s two largest pieces of leg-
islation, the Affordable Care Act
(Obamacare) and Dodd—Frank
Wall Street Reform, both impose
signiﬁcant question marks on
the economy. It is unclear how
retailers and small businesses
will be able to react to health
care requirements. Will new
employees suddenly become
too costly with higher insurance
costs? Will small banks be forced
out of businesses with higher
regulatory compliance costs?
Nobody, including business
and bank owners themselves,
can guess.

Because Romney promises
to repeal and replace these
programs, businesses will be
more certain of their operating
environment. This will lead to
improved economic conditions.

DO: I agree that certainty
is vital to business. Ironically,
your response hits the nail on
the head as to why Gov. Rom-

ney is not the man to create that
certainty. He promises to repeal
and replace Obamacare and
Dodd—Frank, but he has never
indicated the speciﬁc plans he
will implement in their place.
That is what creates uncertainty.
If President Obama is re—elected,
businesses know exactly what
they are going to get because
his policies are already in place,
transcribed on paper.

With regards to the compli-
ance costs, I also agree that
some of these regulations can be
costly, but they are nothing but
a trade—off. In 2002 President
Bush signed the Sarbanes—Oxley
Act to prevent businesses from
manipulating their ﬁnancial re-
cords. The bill costs businesses
a lot, but without it, investors
would not have full conﬁdence
in the ﬁnancial records. The
stock market has done" fairly
well since.

NS: Just because Romney
hasn’t offered too many specif-
ics doesn’t mean he offers less
certainty. The way Obamacare is
structured, there is a possibility
premiums in the small—employer
insurance exchanges could spiral
upward if businesses and con-
sumers don’t behave as expected
. Even Mark Duggan and Robert
Kocher, former economic advi-
sors of the president, acknowl-
edge this potential. And with
Dodd—Frank, small banks don’t
even know what the rules are
yet because regulators haven’t
completed writing the law: More

than 62.9 percent of rule—mak—
ing deadlines set by the act have
been missed. And small regional
banks don’t have the resources
to comply in an optimal way to
rules already written.

This is the type of bureau-
cratic uncertainty causing slow
growth. Even a simple Romney
repeal would offer more certain-
ty. Small businesses today have
no clue what health care costs
will be; banks have no clue how
capital requirements will affect
ability to loan. Put yourself in a
business owner’s shoes: Would
you expand if you had no idea
what the cost of labor or capital
would be in three years?

DO: I don’t understand this
assertion that premiums for
small employers will go up. I
am sure you know when non-
insurance holders’ go to emer-
gency rooms, these increased
costs eventually get rolled off
to small businesses anyway. By
mandating insurance for every-
one, it reduces premiums across
the board because risk is more
spread out. Low-income indi-
viduals are subsidized by the
government and businesses
that comply receive a host of
tax credits.

Businesses in America are
fine. We are not in a state of
chaos. Businesses need assur-
ance that current policy will stay
coherent long term and that the
federal government has a cred-

ible long-term plan to sort out its ﬁnanc-
es. Romney hasn’t offered any credible
plan for this, just ﬁve points seemingly
rehearsed from a Wikipedia page.

NS: Adding more than 30 million
people to the health care system without
adding more doctors will make health
care cost more. Whatever cost savings
there are from emergency room reduction
will be dwarfed by this. And if employers
quickly decide they simply won’t offer
insurance given the new, high mandates

for coverage, many companies will pay
the mandatory ﬁne or decrease hours,
ﬂooding the insurance market with un-
insured. If more than 3 million workers

GABLER STYLE

Pitt fails to take next step as program at Notre Dame

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt football team had the opportunity
to post a statement win Saturday that would
have given the program the shot in the arm
it needs to step up as a competitor in the
ACC next year.

The Panthers let that opportunity slip out
of their hands — or more like sail wide right.

During the second overtime period, the
Panthers blew their shot at ending the game
in Irish defeat when redshirt senior Kevin
Harper kicked a ﬁeld goal that ﬂew to the
right of the goalposts, sending the game into
a third overtime period in which the Irish
ﬁnished with a 29-26 victory.

After taking a 20-6 lead over No. 3 Notre
Dame heading into the fourth quarter, the
Panthers fell apart offensively, defensively
and on special teams.

Despite the collapse, it’s important to
consider what could have been: What if Pitt

A had knocked off a BCS national title con-

tender on the road?

We don’t have to look far to see what
the ramiﬁcations would have been, had Pitt
pulled out the upset victory. Five years ago,

. ‘Pitt shocked No. 2 West Virginia — a team

that had all but packed its bags for the BCS
National Championship —— and the football
program received the adrenaline it desper-
ately needed.

Coming off the dramatic 13-9 victory over
the hated rival in 2007, then-head coach
Dave Wannstedt kicked his recruiting into
gear. Following the upset, he added 10 re-
cruits and ﬁnished with the No. 28 recruiting
class in the country, according to Riva1s.com.

Tino Sunseri, Mike Shanahan, Shayne
Hale,]arred Holley, Joe Trebitz and Andrew
Taglianetti are the remaining players who
committed to Pitt in the wake of that epic
win, which promised brighter horizons and
a return to college football’s upper echelon.

Saturday’s 29-26 triple-"overtime loss
will go down as one of the seniors’ tough-
est, especially considering the amount of
times they felt as though the game would
go their way. '

“A couple of times I thought we had it
sealed,” Trebitz said. “That’s why you play
to the last whistle. You never know what’s
going to happen.”

These redshirt seniors’ careers aren’t
exactly what they signed up for, nor have
they reached the expectations necessary
to return Pitt to the ranks of the college
football elite.

However, they have had some success,
going 38-23 in ﬁve years with the program.
What that overall record doesn’t say is that
Pitt was 19-7 in its ﬁrst two years, when most
of the team’s current seniors were redshirted

uarterback Tino Sunseri (12) strugiecl in the ‘ion quarter, allowing Notre Dame to come

back from a 14-point deficit and win in overtime. Sheldon Satenstein | Senior Staff Photographer

‘ or received little playing time.

Sunseri knows that Saturday presented
them with their best chance to leave a truly
lasting mark on Pitt and amplify the team
for the next batch of recruits.

~ “You want to knock off a top —ﬁve team in
the country, and they are a top —ﬁve team in
the country,” Sunseri said. “They’re a great
football team. We had opportunities, and
we let them slip.”

They didn’t just let a statement win for
2012 slip. The Panthers let a win that could
have propelled them through the rest of the

. season and offseason slip.

While the loss might not signiﬁcantly
affect the future of Pitt football, a win cer-
tainly could have.

With talented local high school players
such as wide receivers Robert Foster and Ty-
ler Boyd and offensive tackle Dorianjohnson
all still seriously considering Pitt, Chryst has
the opportunity to turn an average recruiting
class into a borderline top—25 one.

Given the depleted state of Pitt’s wide re-
ceiving corps, Foster and Boyd could receive
playing time instantaneously. While it is rare
to see a freshman start on the offensive line,
Johnson would add solid talent to arguably
the weakest position group on the team.

Chryst and his players will need to battle

through adversity as they prepare for Con-
necticut this Friday night.

“It’s going to be hard,” cornerback La-
fayette Pitts said. “We got to move on. Time
won’t stop, so we just got to keep pushing
forward.”

It will be hard for Chryst to recruit with-
out a signature win, but not impossible. The
talent is local, giving him a built—in advan-
tage, and the thriving offense he established
as the offensive coordinator at Wisconsin
still attracts recruits.

It isn’t all bad for the ﬁrst-year head
coach. Many would agree that Pitt has made
massive strides since its season-opening loss
to Youngstown State. Though disappoint-
ing for the Panthers, a three-point triple-
overtime loss to a top—ﬁve team will certainly
appear promising to potential recruits.

As the season winds down, Chryst will
need to convince recruits that Pitt is the best
choice for them. For higher-ranked recruits,
schools such as Ohio State, Alabama, Vir-
ginia Tech and West Virginia might attract
their attention.

Chryst’s work is cut out for him in re-
stocking his team’s talent level, and he surely
knows how powerful a win against Notre
Dame would have been. U

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers
pounce
in final

exhibition

Sean Corrado
Staff Writer

Point guard Tray Woodall lofted the ball
toward the basket with just over four min-

utes remaining in Pitt’s second exhibition ‘R’

game. Forward Talib Zanna snagged the
ball in midair and forced it through the
hoop with both hands.

The basket put the Panthers up by 35
points over Division II Hawaii-Hilo and
provided the cheering crowd with an even
bigger statement: After the calamity of
last year, Pitt is ready to start a new sea-
son. 9

The pass marked Woodall’s eighth and
final assist of Friday’s contest at the Pe-
tersen Events Center, where the Panthers

finished off their preseason by defeating *

Hawaii-Hilo 77-45. Last season it took
Woodall three games to acquire that many
assists after coming back from his injury.

“I am just trying to get those guys the
easy shots,” Woodall said. “When they’re
open, I’m gonna feed them.”

When Woodall went down early with a
groin strain and abdominal tear last sea-
son, it was evident the Panthers did not
have enough depth at the guard position
to compete in the Big East.

But now point guard appears to be the

Panther’s strongest position. Three Pitt 

point guards combined their efforts for a
total of 15 assists and only one turnover
on Friday.

Freshman guard James Robinson has
already developed a presence on the court.

Starting the first two exhibition games, —s

Robinson played very well defensively.
He picked up three defensive rebounds,
a block and a steal Friday night in his
contribution to the Panthers’ chemistry.

“Its easy to play with a guy like him,”

Woodall said. “He listens and is eager to 1
learn. He is definitely a complement to '

my game.”

Sophomorejohnjohnson has also im-
pressed head coachjamie Dixon with his
recent play at point guard.

“He has really improved in these last
10 days,” Dixon said.

Johnson came off the bench and tallied
seven points and ﬁve assists in 17 minutes.

FOOTBALL

In the ﬁrst quarter, Notre Dame amassed its
most yards in a quarter this season with 145 as
well as its highest number of ﬁrst downs with
nine but scored just a single ﬁeld goal.

The second scoring drive for the Irish came
to an abrupt halt when the Panthers made a
goal-line stand that culminated in a4-yard loss
before a successful 20-yard ﬁeld goal kick by
Kyle Brindza.

But largely thanks to a huge game from
Graham, who ﬁnished with 174 yards and a
touchdown, the Panthers took a 10-6 lead into
the break.

Pitt redshirt senior quarterback Tino Sun-
seri, whowas 19-for-29 for 164 yards, recorded
his only touchdown in the third quarter when he
connected with freshman tight end].P. Holtz to
give Pitt a 17-6 advantage. The pair had linked
up on the previous play for a 45-yard haul right
down the middle of the ﬁeld.

After this score, the se1l—out crowd —— vocif-
erous until this point — was quiet.

Following a ﬁeld goal by Pitt kicker Kevin
Harper, Notre Dame cut into the lead at the
beginning of the ﬁnal quarter with an 11-yard
touchdown pass from quarterback Everett Gol-
son to T.].Jones, but a shanked extra-point kick
meant the difference remained at eight.

The ball switched hands twice more until
Pitt found itself with an opportunity to ﬁnish
the game.

Needing to use up time, the Panthers went
against common philosophy of running, instead

calling passing plays on their ﬁrst two downs.
The ﬁrst attempt, an incompletion, stopped
the clock. The second attempt imploded when
Sunseri dropped the snap, recovered it but was
then tackled for a loss of four yards.

Facing a long-yardage situation on third-
and—14, Sunseri dropped back, saw nothing
in front of him and then was suddenly under
pressure. Falling down for what looked to be his
sixth sack, Sunseri ﬂipped the ball to Graham,
who didn’t do much better, gettingtackled fora
1-yard loss. So Pitt punted away without having
reached the ﬁrst—down marker.

“I thought we were going to run the ball,”
Graham said of that set of downs. “We have a
great offensive coordinator, he made the play
call, and we stuck with it.”

That offensive drive took less than a minute
to complete, and the punt travelled just 35 yards.

Opportunity squandered.

On an inversely parallel path, Notre Dame
needed two plays to reach the end zone as
Golson connected with widereceiver DaVaris
Daniels for a45-yard pass to the Pitt 5—yard line.

And so, with about two minutes remaining
in the game, Notre Dame running back Theo
Riddick snuck behind the Pitt defense and ran
toward the sideline undetected.

Golson, maneuvering in the same direction
to escape pressure, found the running back on
the edge of the boundary as he ran into a sea of
band members. Going for a two-point conver-
sion on the next play, Golson scrambled right
and acrobatically darted over the goal line to
tie the game.

“You get opportunities, and we let them slip

[away] ,” Sunseri said. “Whenever you have a

top-ﬁve team like that on the ropes and you
have a chance to end the game and you don’t
take advantage of it, you have to be able to end
the game and not give them any more chances.”

With a minute and a half left in the game,
Notre Dame began at its own 33-yard line. Pitt
held strong, containing the Irish to one set of
downs.

Regulation time would end with a level score
of 20.

Pitt had the ﬁrst possession in overtime,
beginning at the 25-yard line.

But the offense suffered a terrible three—play
sequence: Sunseri iiumbledasnap but recovered
for a 1-yard loss, a 5—yard delay of game penalty
on the defense, a 5-yard false-start penalty on
the offense and a third—down drop.

Fortunately for the Panthers, Harper made
the resulting 41-yard ﬁeld goal.

Notre Dame needed to match that to keep
the game alive or score a touchdown to win.

Anincomplete pass followed bya1—yard rush
and 4-yard rush meant ﬁeld goal time. Brindza
obliged by nailinga37-yarder through the posts
to take the game to double overtime.

The order switched, and Notre Dame began
anew.

Its offense moved the ball with ease on the
ground, traveling all the way to the 2—yard line.
And in one play, that eﬁiciency became nothing,
as Cierre Wood fumbled and Pitt safetyjarred
Holley recovered in the end zone to give Pitt the
ball and a chance to win the game.

The Panthers attempted to pound their
way to a touchdown through Graham, giving
him the ball on three straight plays. He came
up two yards short, setting up a 33-yard ﬁeld

This excluslleopportuni ya  
neversleeps and the hometown (super)  

goal attempt for Harper that would allow for a
shocking Pitt victory.

“Whenever we got the ball, I thought that
we were gonna be able to go down and be able
to ice the game,” Sunseri said.

But that wasn’t the case.

The snap was high, and Harper pushed the
kick wide right, indicating yet another overtime
period to come.

Opportunity squandered.

The order reversed again, so Pitt stayed on
offense. And again, the team couldn’t generate
anythingto get near the end zone. Harper con-
verted a44-yard kick to put his team up by three.

Then Notre Dame did what Pitt failed to do
in the fourth quarter or during any of the three
overtimes: reach the end zone. Golson dove
into the pile from a yard out to win the game.

Redshirt senior linebacker Joe Trebitz —
Pitt’s leading tackler on the day with 13 total in
the ﬁrst start of his career ——— reﬂected on his
thought process over the course of the game.

“A couple times I thought we had it sealed,
but that’s why you play to the last whistle. You
never know what’s gonna happen,” 'I‘rebitz said.

After Pitt head coach Paul Chryst said a few
weeks ago that a point would arise when the
team would need senior kicker Kevin Harp-
er, and he would deliver, Saturday seemed as
though it might be that day. Harper made both of
his extra-point kicks and four of ﬁve attempted
ﬁeld goals from 21, 39, 41 and 44 yards.

That solitary miss — which if made, would’ve
won the game — was one of me many missed
chances head coach Paul Chryst rued afterward.

“We had a golden opportunity, and we
missed it,” Chryst said. I
