Job Prospects
Open to Grads

Despite Slow Business

Many Jobs Available

Job prospects for April grad-
uates from the University look
good despite the current slowdown
in business activity, said Walter M.
Ritenour, director of the Univer-
sity Placement service.

Engineers continue to command
the highest salaries of any group
on campus. Dr. Ritenour said that
“although it is too early in the
year to make a comprehensive
forecast, 51 of 249 seniors in the
April, 1961 engineering class al-
ready have received 63 job offers,
and the offers are still coming in
from industries around the coun-
try.” '

Many of the offers are from
defense industries, electrical ma-
chinery manufacturers, and public
utilities. Salaries range from $480
to $640 per month, with the
median‘ at $550. This compares
with a range of from $492 to
$629 per month last year at this
time.

Dorm Rates to Increase

10% Starting This Fall

Residence hall rates will go up beginning with the fall
trimester, 1961-62. The increase will. amount on the average
to less than 10% per student‘, Dr. John Geise, Assistant
Chancellor in Charge of Student Affairs, announced today.

The purpose of the increase is to enable the University
to maintain needed services in a period of high rates.

All women residents will pay.

a standard rate of $190 per tri-
mester. This is an increase of ap-
over the rate

Men will be charged a grad-
uated fee but a greater number
of rooms will be available in the
lower range of the rate scale.

Some rooms will have their oc-
cupancy increased by one student
so that the increased number of

students requiring dormitory space

may be accommodated during the
period before the new dormitories
are completed.

Commenting on the increased
room occupancy, Dr. Geise said,
“Like many other institutions of
higher learning, we are meeting
the challenge of a rapidly-grow-
ing college and university pop-
ulation.

Because health services will be
expanded to a 24-hour per day
basis, beginning with the fall tri-
mester all residence hall students

Approves New

Course Plan

By TONI MCGOVERN

The Academic Assembly of the
School of the Liberal Arts has
approved a slightly modiﬁed form
of the new curriculum program
which was announced on Feb. 27
in The Pitt News.

The modiﬁed form is essentially

~ the same as the earlier one, ex-

cept that the “elementary courses”
are reduced to Written English
and Foreign Language courses,
and the number of credits from
these courses applicable to a de-
gree have been reduced to 12.
The new regulations will not
apply to students currently en-
rolled at the University. They will
affect freshmen registering in the
fall of 1961 and thereafter.
Competence Required
Under the new plan each can-
didate for a Bachelor of Arts or
Bachelor of Science degree must
complete 124 credits in courses
listed in the Liberal Arts bulletin.
A maximum of 12 credits from

other schools of the University
may be included in these 124
credits.

In addition to fulﬁlling the

g e n e r a l graduation require- '
ments, each student must dem-
onstrate a satisfactory level of
competence in Written English
and in a foreign language.

Not more than 12 credits from
elementary courses taken for this
purpose may be applied to degree

Seek Student Improvements

MC Holds Opinion Poll

By KAREN HALPERT

Men's Council, in co—operation
with many other organizations on
campus, is conducting an opinion
poll regarding improvements for
University students. Results will
be published in The Pitt News on
March 29.

Members of Mcn’s Council will
distribute questionnaires today in
the mailboxes of dorm students,
to every fraternity, and in stacks
by the ballot boxes for commu-
ters. in order to insure a good
cross-section of students’ opinions.

Ballot boxes will be located in
Holland l~’lal.l, the Student Union,
and the ground lloor of: the Cathe-
dral.

, Among the items on the ques-
tionnaire will be one concerning
Orientation Week “big brothers”
for freshmen. These upperclass-
men would help orient the fresh-
men taking them on tours of the
campus, presenting them with
freshmen beanies, and acquainting
them with the many experiences
to be gained at the University.
Asks For Suggestions

Concerning social life, students
will be asked whether they would
participate in ice skating parties,
dances, and hayrides held off
campus.

naire will ask for the students’

under the 1961 budget, the Uni-
versity would require only $4,-
550,000 from outside sources to
complete payment of the planned
building project.

Before the State Assembly Mon-
day, the Governor specified how
the 12 million dollar aid should be
p spent by the University.

According to the proposal,
$7,058,765 would be used to buy
land for the construction of a
physical education plant and a
playing ﬁeld near the new
swimming pool, $3,115,749 for
the acquisition of land to build
a professional school complex in
the form of a common facilities
building, ‘including lounges,
cafeterias, and auditoriums to
be shared by each profession.
The new building will be lo-
cated at Forbes Street adjacent
to the new Hillman Library.

The remaining $2,076,867 would
be for land and the health pro-
fessions, specifically, a new den-
tistry building.

Phi Eta Sigma Slates Series
Of Speakers F or Discussions

By MARILYN ASHKENAS

A series of speakers were in-
vited to come and speak to the
members of Phi Eta Sigma, dur-
ing the month of March.

Irving Rothman, advisor to the
organization, and David Sharp,
president of Phi Eta Sigma, hope
that, by having these group dis-
cussions restricted to members
0 only, a closer relationship among

the members will result.

So far they have had Dr.
Chi Liu, the director of the
nese Language Area Center,
spoke on Chinese Customs
Traditions; Vigor Kavalier
spoke on the gold issue.

Dr. Peter Gray spoke on the

“Origin of Life,” VVillia.m Coop-

er, " ‘Case’ Method of Instruc-

tion,” and Robert Gorham. “Eco-
nomics in‘ Everyday Life.”

, Their ﬁnal speaker, who will

come on March 28, will be Fred-

erick Mayer, speaking on “The

Literature on the Bible.”

A Professor of English, Mayer
lives in Pittsburgh with his wife
and three children. In 1956-57 he
was awarded a Ford Foundation
grant to make sound motion, pic-
ture films for use with sopho-
more classes in literature at the

Job Prospects
Opento Grads

(Continued from Page 1)
Salaries Increase
Of the 83 engineers who re-
ceived their undergraduate de-
grees last December, 64 have been
placed so far, and the remainder
are expected to be placed within
the next 30 days.
Salaries for this group are
running even higher than the
$15 to $20 a month national aver-
age increase reported by the
College Placement Council. For
example, the average monthly
salary for a chemical engineer
in the December group was $547
compared with $5203 last spring.
“The outlook for liberal arts
and business administration grad-
uates also appears favorable,
though not as good as the engi-

neering prospects,” Rr. Ritenour
reported.
“Current business conditions

are expected to increase job com-
petition by reducing the number
of jobs available, but starting sal-
aries should not be affected.”
Engineers Diminish

December accounting graduates‘

were also in great demand. Of a
small class of seven, all have
found jobs at an average salary of
$435 monthly, with a high of $500.

Fifteen of the 29 Business

Administration undergraduates
who received their diplomas in

December were placed at an av-

erage salary of $454 monthly.

This April only 249 engineers
will graduate from the Univer-
sity, as compared with 323 who
registered or placement in the
Spring of 1960.

The drop reflects a national
trend which has been ascribed
alternately to the low birth rate
in the late 30’s and to the be-
lief that many high school stu-
dents are entering the ﬁelds of
pure science.

Will You Cooperate?

The opinion poll,that is being conducted_ by Men’s
Council in cooperation with other student organizations is
theﬁrst positive move taken by any student group this
year. The only thing neededito make this maneuver suc-
cessful is for all University undergraduate men to fill‘ out
the questionnaire and deposit it in a ballot box.

Every question being asked is one that should be an-
swered. If astudent thinks that freshmen beanies and big
brothers will help to integrate the incoming freshmen into
the University community, he should at least ﬁll out abal-

lot so that the groups conducting this poll will be able to V

get a clear and concise picture as to its advantage. If he
thinks that these practices are worthless, he even has a
better reason to cooperate with Men’s Council in determin-
ing a future University policy.

The point at issue is not whether one thinks that we

need a beanie week, a more elaborate Men’s Conference or

quieter study areas, but rather that students should show
the initiative to support this group in this endeavor. It is

‘the students’ responsibility to determine future policies for

students who will arrive on the Pitt Campus next year -or
the year afterwards, in addition to themselves.

The best policies can only be established if a complete
cross section of student opinions is registered, and this can
be done only with the full cooperation of the student body.
Why‘ not support ~Men’s Council in this positive move to-
ward setting up‘ a group that could be inﬁuentialin deter-
mining student policies? " '

Ups and Do wns

Confusing and amusing are the only words that can
describe the ﬁfth ﬂoor express elevator that 1s being tested
this week. ’

Although there is a sign over the door of the express
elevator explaining that it goes only to the ﬁfth floor, the
majority of University members do not seem to have their
heads in the sky and for that reason do not even see the
sign.

After stepping into the elevator, they hear, “Fifth ﬁoor
only.” This is where they get confused. The operator then
begins shoving people out of the elevator while saying
“FIFTH ﬂoor only.”

When the elevator arrives at the ﬁfth ﬂoor, the operator
then says, “This is the FIFTH ﬂoor.” We hope that each
operator who "must endure the laughter that follows will

survive the week. Maybe by the end of this experimental-

week, however, University members will be oriented to
its function, and‘ the elevator operators will no longer have
to yell, “FIFTH ﬂoor only.” '

Other than these small complications,’ the express ele-
vator seems to be a worthwhile and efficiently operating
service."

‘ it appears that they have not.

An Unfortunate‘.Reoccurance . . .

Fixing the ‘Fix’

By Jim O'Brien

It has been ten years since the explosion on the
college basketball ﬁx scandal. For those who were
caught “doing business” with gamblers on ball
games, there remains the residue of guilt and
stunted pride and unforgetful-
ness. They claim to have learned
their lesson.

iOthe'rs should have‘ proﬁted.
by’ their "misfortune, but after’
last ‘weeks newspapers revealed
another’ epidemic of underhand
dealings in the roundball sport,

_What liesin the wake of those
exposed recently remains to be
seen. ,

Msgr. John D. Daugherty, .
president of Seton Hall college, says, “These young-
sters are not to be condemned; they are to be
treated with compassion.”

Just recently the “crime of 1951” has been con-
stantly rehashed in the national sports publications,
and the present crop ofvcorrupted hoopsters should

' have realized the graveness of their act. Corrup-
tion has ‘never been compulsory.
From Riches to Rags .
The original ’ contaminated athletes tumbled

heavily from campus hero to common criminal. I

Liberal Arts Requirements . . .

Credit Chaos

By Harriet Welmer

The new degree requirements which the Aca-
vdemic Assembly of the School of Liberal Arts has
established differs from the original policy con-
sidered on Feb. 23 in two major points. The one is
favorable, the other is not.

In the original policy there:
was a clause which read tliat no
Liberal Arts, student could apply
more than 15 credits of work in
the elementary courses of com-
position, languages, mathematics
orlogic "to his ' degree require-

The policy wasn’t approved
when ﬁrst discussed because it
was felt that the language re-
quirement was toosevere. It was.
If the policy had been adopted in its original con-
text, it would have meant that any student who
took an elementary or intermediate language course
would not have received full credit and would
therefore have lost several credit dollars. Since
English composition alone would consume six
credits, only nine other credits taken in the ﬁelds
of languages, mathematics and_ logic could have
been applied to the student’s degree. Elementary
and intermediate language courses which satisfy
the two year work requirement alone consume
14 credits.

By the adopted policy, any student who can
pass thellanguage placement test will fulﬁll his
two year language requirement. Any other courses
in a different language he desires to take, eventif
elementary, will be applied to his degree.
Language Barrier

Only the students who enter- the University
without any language experience or who do not
pass the Language Placement test will be required
to include these credits for completing the language
requirement in the group of elementary courses.
This restriction applies mainly to students taking
French, German, Spanish. or Latin, since this limita-
tion doesn’t apply to work in Russian or Chinese,
even in the elementary areas. This restriction will
even be waived for some of these students however,
if their major requires a certain language — for
example, the chemistry major, who is required to
take German.

The ﬁnal adopted language requirements are

 

 

world, that they be strung up in Effigy — thavs a
small town in Pennsylvania. .

Perhaps the reason so many of the college ad-
ministrators don’t want to punish the boys so
severely is because they are doing some soul.
searching themselves. Virtually _ every sports-
minded college seeks by hook or by crook to attract
the most promising talent to its campus.

“Even without any illegal offers,” write George 
Young, chairman of the NCAA infractions commit-
tee, in a recent magazine article, “high pressure _

recruiting can distort a boy’s sense of values. At

worst, you have institutions of higher learning en- I

couraging a boy to become a party to fraud and
deception.” P

To make an example of some boys because they .

were guilty of being caught in deception, doing
what others do in the shadows is making’ a Prohi-
bition-era farce of the whole; matter.

Prime Examples, A

Only last season John Fridley and Dick Falenski ,

of the Pitt basketball team’ were teased with‘ an‘ en-
ticing bait ——- guarantee of. getting into Dental
School — if they would shave points, so that the
gamblers could beat the point spread installed by
the “bookies.” C I
Their reaction should have been emulated by

those recently scandalized. Fridley and Falenski -

reported the offer to their coach who informed the
authorities.of the fraud attempt. Today, both stu-
dents are‘ in the Dental School on their own merit,
and only this weekend were drafted by the new
Pittsburgh entry in I the American Basketball
League.

I believe that all incomingpathletes-at this Uni-
versity should be given a copy of Dr. H. C. Carl-
son’s ﬁne book, Basketball and You as required
reading. ‘ In one particular passage, the former
ﬂoor tutor remarks:

“To have everything but honesty is to have
nothing, while to have honesty is_ to compensate for
other deﬁciencies and inspire conﬁdence which can-
not be bought. With conscience as an ally, you will
not make the first break that may later cost you
dearly.” M

Additional copies may also be forwarded to the

“prisons where if justice is executed, the gamblers

should have plenty of time for reading in their cells.

extremely liberal. Since most students entering
college have attained the basic skills in at least one
language, or should have, there is no reason why
the University shouldn’t penalize the few who ar-
rive here unfamilier with any foreign tongue.

On this point —- the elementary language re-
quirement —— the Academic Assembly was extreme-
ly fair to the student, but in regards to the other
Point — the area of mathematics and logic — they
made an error which defeats the entire purpose of
demanding that entering freshmen possess more-of
the basic skills.

The Academic Assembly voted to have mathe-
matics and logic ‘eliminated from the list of elemen-
tar)’ courses. The fact that they reduced the num-
beriof credits in elementary courses that could be
applied to the student’s degree requirement of 124
credits from 15 to 12 credits does not make up for
this gross leniencyon the part of the Liberal Arts
School.

Math Mix-Up —

A student who takes Ma-th 19, 20 and 21 will be
permitted to apply these credits to his degree. Each
of these courses in elementary mathematics is re-
quired by almost every university and college in the
United States for entrance, just as one basic lan-
guage is. Yet the University’s School of Liberal
Arts is willing to honor credits in these grade
school‘and high school math courses for degree —-
skills which a student entering college should pos-
sess ——- but they will not honor two years of ele-
mentary French taken in college since the students
should have acquired these skills in high school.
This is poor logic"! . ‘

It is rather unusual that the Academic Assembly
should credit these extremely elementary courses
of mathematics especially when we are living in
What is called an age of science. This oversight
merely enables more students to graduate from_ the
School of Liberal Arts who have satisﬁed the
natural science requirement with six credits of
arithmetic and 12 credits of psychology.

The goal of the Academic Assembly in revising
their degree requirements was to develop students
who are adept in all ﬁelds of the liberal arts. The
fact that they have overlooked science is not only
an insult to that ﬁeld of enlightenment, but in addi-
tion indicates that they think an educated Arts
student must demonstrate proﬁciency only in the
social sciences and" the humanities.

Five Men To Make Trip

DICK MARTIN
Goes After 123 Pound Crown

Tennis Squad
Conducts Drills

Coach Tests Ability
In Ind0or:Workouts
By ART FLEISCHNER

Tennis reached, it is hoped, its
nadir last year when the Pan-
ther’s record slipped t-o 3-9. The
main cause of this was the tri-
mester plan which left the squad
with only six boys for the ﬁnal
few matches. 1

The win-lost column was the
poorest since 1958 when Bill Sum-
took over the coaching
reigns. In his initial season Sum-
mers compiled an admirable 7-2
mark. In 1959 the record was 8-3.
Sumaners’ three-year ledger is in
the black with an 18-14 ﬁgure.

‘Last season was especially tough
for the Panther racquetmen as
they lost six matches by 5-4
scores. “We are looking forward
to this season with anticipation
and sweet revenge,” said the
youthful coach.

So far this year Summers has ~

hadthe squad practicing on a

"couple of tennis drills that he
has worked out. One he calls
the “tennis ability test” in which
the players. standing behind a
line, see how many times they
can hit the ball above a line on
the wall in 30 seconds.

In the other drill each man
must hit the white sphere against
the wall 25 consecutive times; but,
the player must allow the ball to
bounce before he may hit it.

‘ V the trip are Dick Martin, Larry Lauchle, Daryl Kelvington,

John Zolikoff and Jim Harrison.

Martin and Lauchle both have
good chances of capturing National
crowns and thus ‘become the
eighth and ninth Panthers to do
so.

Runner-up Twice

Coach Rex Peery feels that,
“both boys have excellent chances
to win. Lauchle should be seeded
first since he was runner-up for
the past two years.”

If Lauchle is to win he will
have to reverse the loss he suf-
fered to Michigan’s Fritz Kel-
lerman. The Wolverine handed
Lauchle the only dual meet loss
of his collegiate career and the
Panther is conﬁdent that re-
venge will be his. Others that
are in contention for the 130'
pound title are Tom Huﬂ of
Iowa and:Don Pierce of‘0kla-
homa State.

Martin, who along with Lauchle
holds the Eastern titles, will face
stiff competition from Oklahoma
State’si Hatta, in his bid for the
123 pound title. The Junior from
Latrobe, who lost in the quarter
ﬁnals last year, should be seeded
among the top four.

Three Darkhorses

Peery stated, “Kelvington, Zoli—

koﬂ? and Harrison can’t be con-

:sidered favorites, but must be

ranked as darkhorses with an out-
side chance of taking champion-
ships.” ‘
Kelvington and
lost in the second round last
year. With another year’s ex-
perience there is a good chance
they can improve on that. Har-
rison, a sophomore. has been a
real surprise and is also capable
of placing.

Concerning the team title, Peery
feels, “Oklahoma State will be the
definite favorite. Behind
should be Oklahoma University
and Oregon State,” the host school.

Lehigh Ranked 4th

Zolikoﬁ both

The mat tutor said that, “East-

ern champion Lehigh would have
to be ranked no better than
fourth despite their strong over-
all balance.

Even though he is only taking
a ﬁve man squad, Peery be-
lieves that his team must be
considered as having a chance to
go all the way. “We have a
good chance to get first places
from Martin and Lauchle. If
we do and our other boys are
able to place then we might
have enoug-h points to take the
team title.”

The best the Blue and Gold has
ever done at a National Tourna-
ment is second. They accomplish-
ed this feat twice, in 1954 and
1957. ,

This year they have a good
chance, to take two individual
titles and a chance, a very slim
chance, of taking the team title.

Unique Spikes T-Iold Key?

Ralph Shutterley Expected  
T 0 Be “Horse”  [Wound A

No Southpaw Pitchers Bidding
For Starting. Positions on Staff

_ By JIM O'BRIEN .

Just as the success of the inﬁeld corps seems to be highly
dependent on the therapy exercises planned by trainer Roger
McGill, the success of the Panther baseball pitching taff
is highly dependent on a novel idea concocted by Dr. William

K. Smith, the team physician.

Ralph Shutterly, the only hurler who lettered in the
past season, is plagued by a weak knee on his right leg. Dr.

Smith believes that when
pitcher swings out of his delivery,
his lead footjams when it strikes
the inﬁeld surface. “If it hits hard
enough,” he reasons, “something
has to give, and the knee is the
closest joint.” 0

To correct this hazard, he has
designed a shoe with realigned
spikes. They are shaped in a
broken-circular fashion, that en-

ables the foot to swivel in the
dirt according to Dr. Smith’s
theory.

Only three other members of
the staff have seen collegiate ac-
tion. Larry Carra, a dimin_utive
5’6” moundsman from Allderdice,
will be hurling for his ﬁnal year
and hopes that it’ll be a good one.

Lauran Guthrie, a senior from
Charleston , West Virginia, just
completed his competition in the
squash courts for Coach Ben Pope
and arrived for spring practice
for baseball in go_o_<_i shape. “He
didn’t throw enough last year to
letter,” explained.Lewis, “but I
know that he’s good enough to be
a big help to us."

The only other veteran is
Dick Venglik, a junior from
New Kensington, who is aiming
to ﬁre often enough to gain a
letter award this summer. Lew-
is promises to give him the op-
portunity if he proves himself.

There are eight other hopefuls

. on the mound crew. It is odd that

there is not a southpaw among the
crew. In fact, Paul Messner, a 23-
year old pitcher from the sopho-
more ranks, hailing from Dor-

Others hoping to land starting
berths are: George Gress, Frank

Redington, Jim Schmidt, Steve
Snyder and Jim Sylvis. Three of
these are from City League mem-
ber schools.

Thus far, Lewis doesn’t know
too much about his potential
hurlers. He hasn’t been able to
get them outdoors until this
week, and previously all they
were able to throw was the fast
ball.‘ They whipped their fast
stuff in the conﬁnes of the bat-
ting cage.

Dick Wirth, former Panther
pitcher now in graduate school,

has been helping Lewis mold the‘

staff into shape. “If they can mas-
ter a curve ball like he threw,”
Lewis remarked, “I’ll be real glad.
It hooked like a ball falling off

Track Team
Finishes 3rd
In Ohio Meet

By ED HOWARD

Coach Carl Rees’ trackmen
gave indications last week of
a pleasant outdoor season,
ﬁnishing third in the annual
Ohio Invitational at the
Cleveland Arena.

Rees took a four—man combo toi

the Cleveland meet and raked in
two third places, good enough to
beat out highly rated Villanova
and Manhattan. The Panthers
dropped in behind‘ Western Mich-
igan, the winner, and Michigan.
» The mile relay team, featuring
seniors Bill Hinchberger and Bob
Shanafelt, junior Reed Clarke,
and sophomore Vance Carter,
carded a sparkling 3:24.

In the 600-yard run, Carter
ﬁnished only 1.5 seconds behind
the winner, coming up with a
time of l:10.6 for the distance.

Back at home, the thinclads,

like most of the spring athletic "

teams, are waiting for things to
dry up.

“The stadium track is still too
soggy,” says Coach Rees. “Only
the weight and distance men have
been able to get any outside
work.” '

Rees is anxious to take his
team off the stadium board
track, if for no other reason
than to cut down on minor in-
juries. The unbanked indoor
track seems to induce pulled
muscles, shin splints, and many
other hurts that hamper an
athlete’s conditioning. ’

Conditioning is Rees’ main
concern, preparing for the opener
against Maryland at the stadium
cinders. Most of his men are do-
ing overdistance work at this
stage, getting set toﬂex their
muscles as soon as the weather
permits.

Behind Panthers’ First Pair of Ends,

A Lack of Experience

If the Panther gridders are to
make a name for themselves next
fall it will require yeoman duty
from quite a few sophomores.
Coach John Michelosen, who is-
usually hesitant about pl.aying
second year men at great length,
will have no choice in the matter
this year.

Steve Jastrzembski and Woody
Haser will give the Cats a ﬁne
pair of ends, but behind them the
lack of experience shows.

Haser, who handles the right
end spot, is an outstanding defen-
sive player. Though billed as a
second stringer last year, he was
frequently in the startingeleven
if the Panthers kicked off, in or-

der to utilize his defensive ability. ,

Not Consistent
The right end berth on the sec-
ond unit should be a battle be-
tween John Kuprok and Bob
Long. Kuprok has shown ﬂashes
of offensive brilliance in the past,
but hasn’t been consistent.
Long could be a real sleeper.
Due to a torn cartilage in his
knee, he was unable to see ac-

jury he had been impressive.

tion last year.

mended and Long should see’

plenty of action next season.
Othersvieing for action at right
end are Frank Walton, Ron Dod-
son and Paul Jenkins.
Outstanding Receiver
On thepother side of the line
there is no doubt that J astrzemb-
ski can do the job oﬁensively. This
is not to say that Steve’s defensive
play is lacking, but he has become
known as an outstanding receiver.
Behind Jastrzemski there is a
total lack of experience. Joe
Kuzneski, Gene Sobelewski, Bob
Chisdak, Dan Picciano and Al
Grigaliunas don’t have any var-
sity experience to their credit.
Michelosen s a i d, “Everybody
has to prove themselves. We are
hopeful that keen competition will
produce some good boys.”

The sophomore will have to
produce or it may be a long sea-
son for the Panthers. Mike Ditka
and Ron Delﬁne will be sorely
missed.

Frosh Matmen Hold Promise
Of Bolstering Future Teams

By BOB Sl\IIZlK

The frosh matmen gave indication that they will be
able to help the varsity where they need it most come next
season. With the exception of Jim Harrison the varsity has
been unable to develop a consistent winner in the 157-191
pound classes.

When Gene Bernier received his degree in Busi-

‘ness Administration at the University of Michigan

in 1957, he had top offers from several businesses.

’ Gene chose Michigan Bell Telephone Company '

because: “This job was tougher to get. There was
no doubt in my mind that I was being carefully
evaluated for a responsible management job. Just
getting this job was a challenge.”

One of Gene's early assignments was writing
a training manual for new employees which would
explain telephone accounting in simple everyday
terms-—a tough job even for a seasoned writer.
But Gene did it. And his next step was a natural.

In November, 1958, he was transferred to the
Michigan Bell Economic Studies Section as editor
