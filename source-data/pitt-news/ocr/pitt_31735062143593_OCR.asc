does the student band, and never does

the band is’_known to take parfevery

calls upon them» for their ‘services-
whiclris very often. No other stu-

much._ A“ still_greater fact-‘is that

The whole hill on which Pitt stands
is und_ermined,.and there is an open-
*ing into the mines below the Medical
Building. In back of Alumni Hall
there is also acaved-in opening. This
_mine was opened abou-tA50 years ago,
anrlthere are still several men. living

around here who worked in that mine

in their younger days. The inside. of
those mines was still" in fairly good
condition, and is heldjup. in places
where the old mine props‘ havenot
completely rotted away. ' Other places
have caved ‘in, due to the shocks of?
the blasting needed in thehexcavatioh»
work of the stadium. Many old relics.
were found in these mines," most-in-I
teresting among which were several
old hand-made mine picks. Each pick
was made ofjf,our_pieces w‘_eldedAto-
gether.- The main part of .the..plck
was made of two pieces" of«wro1ight»
iron, welded together at the ends‘, but
bent apart in the middleto make an
opening for the wooden handles. The

ends of the pick were tipped,’ with“

steel points, making the old-fashioned
type of pick about the same length as
the modern one. An interesting. side-

, light is thrown on the difference of

the durability of iron and steel. Both,‘

_A In theiirst period, it was very. evi-
dent to any plebeian, watching the
first conclavef of these two, “future
rivals, that the’W. & J. defense -was
yery stiff. Pitt received theliick-off»

'the Washlngt‘onA_CoAuntlans’ line was
almost! invulnerable Aand they decided
to kick. Hagan endeavor_ed._t_o‘A carry
out orders, but_ befoAAre he could get
the ball away, thew’. & J. forwards
‘were. upon him ‘and blocked the kick,
.‘fBiggie’,’ A7Dou_ds,-. the -. giantstackle
gathered it up‘ and thunAderAedA to_ the
-Pitt 5-yard, line..- The ball was called
‘back because the consensus‘ of __opi_n-'
Alon -among the officials was.tl1'Aat the
 & J,‘ men were off-side in. their
-eagerness toﬁblock the kick,, Then
-Booth, Hagan and I-l_oban started an
.aggraga_t.ed‘ assault on 1 the 1.oppo'slng
A-line‘, and worked the ball -to ‘the :Vice_-‘_
Presidents’ 20-yard line ..whAe're-*th_ey
were .-penalized 15 yards for holding.

Nevertheless, a Pitt touchdown

froin the W._& J. 25-yard line, the
rut backs with Booth at their hea'_a_
reached the W. _& J. 4-yard line where
the big "full-back employed a very;
clever fake reverse play and dropped
over the line for ﬁrst blood. . Hoban's’
try for extra ipoint failed. A
‘Seemingly - enraged by the" failure
of their defense to hold up against
the" plunging Pa.ntl1e'r’bfack‘s, the W.

in a moment had Heisel loose for a
