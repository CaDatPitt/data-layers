The sold-out Pitt-Penn State foot-
ball game has evoked student
protest, and condemnation of the
Athletic Department’s alleged
mishandling of the tickets sales

from several University offices.

dents. “We’ve got a situation
where a lot of students want to go
to the game, but can’t because the
Athletic Department sold tickets to
the community before they took
care of Pitt students,” he said.
The official Athletic Department"
response to such complaints is to
cite lack of student attendance at
home games. Casimir Myslinski,
Athletic Director, noted, “The
average attaendance for the last
four home games was less than
6,000. We added a thousand more
to our allotment of student tickets
for the Penn State game just to be
on the safeside. We really expect-

. ed a thousand or more tickets to

remain unsold.”
Myslinski explained the allotment

policy was based on the assumption
that many students would go home
for the Thanksgiving holidays. The
fact that the game is to be
nationally televised also ﬁgured
prominently in the decision to allow

v7000'tickets for student use.

LAC, however, challenges - the
7000 ﬁgure, maintaining the actual
number of student tickets sold was
closer to 6000. Carl :Fink, LAC

CCROTC Otticial Suggests

Academic Policy Changes

/BY KEN GORMELY

Pitt ROTC Coordinator Robert,

Nossen, imade an unaggressive
plea in an interview yesterday that
CAS faculty members surrender
and re-evaluate the explosive pol-
icy which obliterated academic

jcredit for military science courses

several years ago.

Of the nearly 300 universities
which offer Army ROTC programs,
only 13 do not currently accept
military science courses for credit
towards graduation. Pitt's CAS is
among this group.

“The ROTC in no way wants to
tell the faculty how to operate,”
Nossen explained. “But any
decision affecting student welfare
should be re-examined from time to
time.” And the ROTC coordinator
felt it was now time to investigate
this policy. initiated in the late
1960's, which prohibits students

ﬁom receiving credit for courses.
related to the military program.

Nossen was convinced this prac-
tice was initially implemented as a
result of negative attitudes towards
the military during the Vietnam

" War, but felt recruitees today

    

‘should not have to suffer for the

passions of that particular time.

“We were involved in the most
unpopular war in the nation’s
history, and there were strong
feelings of anti-militarism,” Nos-
sen said. And since “the Army.
does not create wars,” he believed
students in the ROTC were being
unfairly penalized.

Under the present policy, Nossen
claimed the College was placing an
unfair burden on students going
through Pitt under the ROTC
program. “They have to take these
courses on top of the regular load.
It becomes a penalty against the.
student.”

Nossen also insisted “The ‘ROTC
courses are valid, the faculty are
qualified, and the students are
learning very important materials
through these programs.’.’

He feared a continuation of a
faculty refusal to give credit for
these courses might cause them to
become “wishy-washy,” since the
average student would not be able
to handle such an enormous work
load.

The tremendous amount of work
required because these courses are

Stir SGB Controversy

BY BILL MOORE

Controversy over the philosophy
of the new election code proposed
by the Student Government Elec-
tion Committee (SGEC) dominated
Wednesday's Student Government
Board (SGB) meeting which ended
with both. groups agreeing to carry
on the debate this afternoon.

The Board.‘ also discussed the
problem of the limited number of

Surveillance System

Pitt. is ‘installing a new electronic
surveillance system throughout the
campus to cut down on run-away
thefts ofequipment. The Pitt-de-
signed Honeywell system can
monitor 39,000 security situations
simultaneously, and may cost
nearly "$2 million over, the next

. eight years.

A sister system included in the
two phase project will-be located in
Hillman .Library, and will stach
physical plant _equipment such as
heating, ventilation and air condi-
tioning.

The security nerve center in
Varsity Hall will receive informa-
tion from "end-line equipment,”
built to detect intruders in areas
requiring security.

The Honeywell program accord-
ing to Director of Campus Police

Kurt Graham, is an effort to put a7

dent in the $70-80,000 worth of
equipment taken from Pitt in the
last year and to free security
personnel for. other duties. .

“With this new system,” said
Graham, “we’ll find out what’s
happening immediately. It won’t
be just an exercise in report writing
the next day.” .

In the event of a break-in, the
device at the location will instantly

relay an_ alarm to the Varsity Halli

nerve-center. A high-speed printer
will detail the time of entry, the
location and extent of the break-in.

Through the use of motion detect-
ors and a visual display unit, a map
will be projected on a screen
showing a floor map of the area
affected, and detailing the move-
ments of the intruder by a glowing
red indicator.

To ’ complete the James Bond
capabilities of the security phase of
the Honeywell System, card read-
ers using photo-sensitive detectors
will be installed in some buildings

arrangements.

where the Honeywell Alarm System will be installed. The system can

monitor up to 39,000 security situations simultaneously.

“Take Varsity Hall for instance,”
Graham said. “We have about
15-20 keys for this building. lfl lose
my set, we either forget about
security or change all the locks in
the building. That’s an expensive
proposition. .

A “The loss of one key means the_

security of an entire building is
compromised.” b

The computer can automatically
lock an entire building from Varsity
Hall. Statistically, the system
would help police officials at Pitt
spot areas of his crime incidence,
and relocate manpower according-
ly.

“We’ll be able to spot trends in
crimes more easily,” said Univer-
sity Police Training Officer Sam
Conte. “Before we had to do it by
hand.

“You can try to provide‘ as much
freedom as possible, but when you

said.

In the event of a failure of the
network at " Varsity Hall,
security function can be transferred 
to the. installation in Hillman 

Library which would normally ’

handle environmental equipment
as a redundancy mechanism.
A whole spectrum of security

equipment could be connected to I ’

the main system, including infra-
red sensors, trip. alarms, motion
detectors and heat-smoke moni-
tors, according to Gil.
Commenting on the Big Brother

tronic security systems at Pitt, both
Graham and Conte said the scope
of the Honeywell Program was“

ance of areas and people in a

1 The ticket office supervisor, Chris

"  Chergi, described the sales. “The

tickets wenton sale Monday, and
we ran out first at 1 pm the same
day. We requested more tickets

1 from the Field House and got them.

We sold on Tuesday until 11:45,

 when we ran out completely.”

Milani., said the tickets were
delivered in several groups; first

, 2400, then 1700, and ﬁnally the

remainder of the 6225 officially
tabulated student allotment.

The Student Union ticket office
also sold 50 tickets each at $5 and
$7, said Milani. “And that ac-
counts for allthe tickets they gave
us. We asked again and again, but
we didn’t get’ any more tickets,”
Milani said.

Dan Maloro, Director Student
Activities, criticized the handling of
the ticket sales. “We were just
called and told that were to give out
tickets, starting Monday. We were
to give out 6400 tickets, and 6400
people showed up in a day and half.
We called and called, crying for

weekend to get the tickets out in

got about 9,000 tickets, according
to our standard contract agree-
ment. We also gave tickets to
several outlets throughout the
area, which we do for all ' games,
but we don’t give out too many
because we like to keep closer
control of the sales.”

. Myslinski detailed the Penn State

allotment, another source of addi-
tional student protest. “The 10,000
tickets given to Penn State are all
general admission. No student
tickets were given to Penn State;
it’s up to them to distribute the
tickets.”

Nearly 4000 general admission
tickets were sold at the Fitzgerald
Field House at $5 and $7 each, said
Cratsley.

Joyce deplored the “total lack of
foresight on the part of the Athletic
Department," and said LAC is
contemplating taking action to
remedy the situation. Fink said,
“Our first priority is to get students
into the game, and then to make
sure this sort of thing doesn’t
happen again.” ’,

While the game is considered
completely sold out, the possibility
of opening the stadium to standing
room has been raised by students
and university officials.-

The Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs Alfred Moye’s office is
taking complaint calls, and >Moye’s'
secretary said, “There aren’t any
more tickets to sell or exchange but
people are still wondering about
standing room. All we can say is,

“a major rewrite and restructuring
of past codes," was met by general
approval from the SGB with the
exception of a few key issues.

The major disagreement between
the Board and the SGEC centered
around a final paragraph of the
proposed code which gives the
power to add [specific operational
by-lays to the SGEC and the
Student Government Judicial
Board [SGJB].

“This is to insure that the political
nature of the Student Government

I Board does not interfere’ with the

unbiased nature of the election
code and the Election Committee,"
the code reads.

SGB President Furick objected to
the provision, maintaining the ul-
timate power of code revision
should lie with the Board.

SGEC Chairman Chuck Deidrich

explained the commfttee’s ration-*

ale. “This whole thing is obviously
very political and the Board, any
board, has the possibility of vested
interests. We think it would be
extremely wise to take the power of
controlling the code out of the
Board's hands.”

Deidrich added the Board could
replace the committee by a major-
ity vote if they felt the committee
was not doing its job correctly.

Other issues concerning the code
included the status of write-in
candidates and the length of time
allowed for campaigns.

Furick argued the write-in ballots
should only be counted if the name
of the candidate is spelled correct-
ly, while the SGEC said their
criterion would be “the obvious
intent of the voter.”

Furick also disagreed with the
code’s provision allowing the SGEC
to regulate the date and time set for
campaigning.

“Restricting the campaign is just
ludicrous,” Furick said. “It would
be better to make campaigns
longer in order to get more
students involved.” '

Further discussion of the propos-
ed code will continue at a special
SGB meeting today (3 pm, .305

  SGB Controversy Stirs

SU).

Legal Awareness Committee

(LAC) member Kevin Joyce ap-__,-

proached the Board to discuss the
problem with student tickets for the
Pitt-Penn State football game.
“Legal Awareness has received
a number of complaints concerning
the fact that students couldn’t get
tickets," Joyce told the SGB.

He said he had learned that while
the student capacity at Pitt Stadium.
was 9,000 people, only 6,400
student tickets were sold for the
game against Penn State to be held
at Three Rivers Stadium. He
added that 10,000 tickets had been
allotted to Penn State fans. .

“Students have a right as stu-
dents to attend this game,” Joyce
said calling the recent ticket sales
“a royal rip-of ." .

Furick defended the ticket sales
procedure saying, “In past, home
games, only 6,400 or so students
have attended and it was just
assumed that this is how‘ many
would go to the Penn State game.”

“But it is the biggest game of the
year and it just doesn’t make sense
to think that more students
wouldn’t attend this one,” SGB
member Paul Hertnekyu answered.

Joyce suggested the Board work
with LAC to attempt to alleviate the
situation at the Penn State game by
attempting to open the stadium to

' standing room, and also asked the

Board to look into the matter to
prevent a reoccurrence of the
problem.

“I’m sure if, they had to make
more room at the Penn State game
they could,” Joyce said.

Director of Student Activities Dan
Meloro told the Board his office
was also concerned with the mat-

_Student Affairs) has asked me to

coordinate an effort to decide how
to handle this in the future. I would
like to openly solicit anybody who

distribute a limited number of
tickets to come and talk with me. It
looks as though Student Affairs will
decide how tickets are distributed
in the future,” Meloro said.

not recognized for credit. asserted
Nossen, has also caused many
ROTC students to drop out, and
has made recruiting much more
difficult.

“We're just asking them (the CAS

' faculty) to look the courses over

again,” he said. “If they don’t feel
they're good enough, we’ll bring
them up to standards.”

Present Dean of the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences (FAS) Jerome
Rosenberg, recalled some of the
more outstanding arguments level-
ed against the ROTC which led the
1968 decision to terminate acade-
mic credit for military science
courses. Rosenberg was not Dean
at the time of that decision.

The first‘ point which miliated
against credit for these courses,
Rosenberg feld, was the belief by
faculty members that the handling

of these courses was really not up.

to the discretion of the Pitt faculty.
“There was some concern that

curriculum for these courses was
not completely determined local-
ly,” Rosengerg said. “It was felt
that many emanated from the
National ROTC Program.”~

The second consideration involved
concerned the stifling of freedom of
choice for the student. Rosenberg
pointed out the ROTC policy of
forcing a recruitee to “contract
himself to accept a commission in
the army,”«. met with opposition
from the faculty, who were con-
cerned with providing a “maxi-
mum freedom of choice” for all
students at Pitt.

The substance of the 1968 deci-
sion, said Rosenberg, has not been
formally discussed since. .

CAS Dean Robert Marshall said
the faculty members were aware of
the ROTC’s entreaty to reconsider
returning credit for military-related
courses, and said, “We’re going to
do that.” He said the question is
on the agendy to be discussed at

the CAS Council meeting in a few

weeks.

The University has reneged on its commitment to Pitt students to
allow free admission to all. home football games by allocatingonly a
minimum of student tickets for the nationally televised Pitt-Penn State
Thanksgivirig Day game.
The exact number of tickets allocated to students differs depending on
thesoiirceoftheinfonmtion. AccordingtoAthleticDirectorCasmir

Director of Student Activities Dan Meloro 6400 tickets were allocated to

Manager Terry Milani is 6525. *
-However, one of the _most interesting facets of this situation is the

 game. More than 9000 students attended the Southern C'al
 earlier in the season, and it ._was not an average game.
A And certainly by allocating few tickets to students, the University
f.,would be in a position to garner more revenue from paying customers.
We hope this is not the motivation of the Athletic Ofﬁce. If it is,
jthough, it indicates there is a need for the establishment of new
‘priorities within the football program.

Politics and Elections

The Student Government Board not only should approve the elections
 code proposed by the SG Elections Committee at their emergency
.. session today, but they should also initiate the processes which would
in effect make the code a permanent mechanism of Student
 ‘ Government.  '
 The code was" not approved by the SGB attheir regular meeting
~' ‘ . Wednesday, due to a reluctance among some board members to accept
_:.the ﬁnal clause. That clause stipulates that jurisdiction over th
,  elections be centralized in the Student Government Election
~ Committee and the Student Government Judicial Board. The purpose
A, . of the clause is “to insure that the political nature of the SGB does not
interfere with the unbiased nature of the elections code and the
SGE ." .-
We wholeheartedly support the code and the philosophy behind the
 addition of this ﬁnal clause. As mentioned in a previous editorial past

V‘ ,, As the clause states, if the decisions are made by the SGEC and the
.  SGJB whose’ activities, according to the SG Constitution, are unbiased
 and non-political, there can be no doubt the election will not have been
‘influenced unfairly by a reconstruction of an elections code.
Quite clearly the elections committee should not be subject to the
political games which can occur in any political race, and have indeed
occurred within Student Government in the past. Furthermore, it
__ - should be remembered, that it is the SGEC which has the responsibility
‘ of implementing the code and not the SGB. ‘
Thus, under no circumstances should the elections co 'ttee be
 compelled to conduct the elections within a questionable atmosphere
 as a result of Board interference with the_SG elections. 'Ihe Board
' — should have no authority whatsoever to revise the code.
Andif the code is made a/pemianent ﬁxture, no future SGB could
manipulate the committee to suit their ‘interests. For the code to

Black Sturlies crisis

I

BY TOM SMITH

The nation's mood has changed
greatly since the turbulent and
socially conscious period of the late
60's, and this change has been
reflected on American college
campuses. Most observers say
today's college students are too
career oriented to be cognizant or
disturbed. by the problems of
modern society. ‘

That theory no longer seems
valid, however. And surprisingly it
was proven inconclusive at Pitt--a
major urban university in which the
only incident of student unrest was
student occupation of a computer
center- during a period which
featured the student take-over at
Columbia, the threats of violence at

Cornell, and ultimately, the tragic ‘

deaths at Kent State.

A few weeks ago more than 100
students protested the administra-
tion's appointment of a black
studies chairman.
years ago a figure of 100 students

- would have been ridiculed by most

campus radicals of any reputation.

But, to interest more than 100
students in a protest at a generally
apathetic campus like Pitt, espe-
cially when protest, confrontation,
or occupation are judged to be as
old as the devil theory itself, is

truly anfamazing feat. It certainly

should not be treated with scoffs or
indifference.

And surprising as it may seem,
the reason for this sign of activism
is the same as the motivations for
the uprisings in the late 60’s. Black
students are protesting an aca-
related administrative
decision, the selection of a

Four or five.

presence of overtones of ' social
malady, racism. .
But, why the fall of ’74? Perhaps,
students, or at least a group of
students, have realized they have a
role to ‘play
operations of the University. And
now administrators (at least in the
next few weeks) will have to learn,
again, how to operate in such an
atmosphere. V. ‘

Administrators in the‘-‘.,6:G's?, well.

versed in academics, were‘ forced to.

resolve student complain-ts related

to the nation's social problems of
which they had little knowledge or
experience. Most were not
accustomed‘ to students seizing
their offices .in order to compel the
University to end its association
with the Defense Department.
The question of opening a

playground for neighboring ghetto

children, instead of continuing with
plans to build a gymnasium, was a
new phenomenon for many urban
college administrators. Those
unable to cope with the new
situation resigned to a more quiet
and tranquil existence.
Eventually, administrators
learned to adapt to the crises and

called on the federal government to .

be more responsive to the demands
of its youth. Student representa-
tives became members of most
significant university governing -
bodies. But, then it all ended.

, A new generation of students,

who had only witnessed/ the
turbulence, enrolled in colleges;
Students retreated to veekend
parties, the chemistry labs, and
Chaucer forgetting they had an

lbuecamie apathetic and student

representatives became token and
their voices insignificantly noticed,
and in many cases not even raised.
After all, it was no longer the era of
student activism.

However, the incidents at Pitt in
the last few weeks represent a
source of revival for modern .
education. Students at last seem to
be concerned with a little more
than books, parties, or the time of
the’ next bus.hmne.’ A group of

students hnvcﬂndn-violently 'de- .,
monstratecl thdr concern with thej
course of their education and the .

future of their people. '

They have said to administrators,
that they made the wrong decision,
and that the processes used to
arrive‘ at‘ the decision “were
blatantly unfair and a violation of
a previous University commitment
to black students. '

How long will it last? A day, a few
weeks, or maybe just, until the
resolution of the black studies
crisis. It is simply anyone’s guess.
But hopefully, this student concern
with the academic program at Pitt

_ will not dissipate, for it is about

time we, as students, dedicated our
efforts to more than grade reports.

We are living in a tragic world--a
world which allows million to die of
hunger, while other feed themsel-
ves on this misery. In this country
alone, the richest nation on earth,
13 to 23‘ million people are

suffering from starvation. This is a -

world which encourages poor
nations to fight other poor nations

instead of feeding their hungry. _. t 

And if the University--that insti-
tution of education and learning--
cannot spawn a greater social
consciousness among its students,
and stimulate solutions to the
world's problems, then the hypo-
crisy of mankind will continue in all
its unabashed shame and the
civilization .of man will have been
meaningless.

In the meantime, though, Pitt

. administrators will have to learn,

again, the appropriateresponse to
student activism. They will have to

realize that students, too, have a -

role in the University governing
processes, and the " traditional
stereotype of an administrator
operating in a vacuum beholden to
no one but his own-conscience
many no longer be one who works
for the best interests of the
University.

z-3.pAn Appeal to

Coach /\/Ia/ors
Dear Editor; '5

I direct this complaint to Coach
Johnny Majors because I believe he
is probably the only one who" cares
enough about the students at this
university to do anything to correct
a very inequitable situation.

I have gone to Pitt for four years,
paid my activities fee promptly,
attended every home game and

. .. fanatically supported the Pitt foot-
"ball team like many other staunch

fans. I have given all the’ vocal
support Coach Majors ask for and
have cheered with “pride and
enthusiasm.”

I have waited four years to see Pitt
beat Penn State and I’m confident
that this is the year. However,
when I went to pick up my ticket (of

which I had (been told there’ were

plenty). I heard to my disbelief
that there were none left. “That's
impossible," I said. “I have
already paid for my ticket.” and
proceeded to show my validation
card. “I’m sorry but all the

available student tickets were dis—_

tributed,,’,’ was the reply.

Since Three Rivers Stadium holds
over 50,000 people, one would
believe that there would be plenty
of seats to accomodate all interest-
ed students. The only plausible
explanation for the shortage is that
the additional students tickets were

- sold to the general public. Some-

one will be sitting in a seat that I
‘have already paid for.
The question I must ask Coach

Majors is, “How do you expect to -
. get continued student support after

they were ripped-off like this?"
When next season comes rolling
around and you, ask for enthusiasm

the guy who is sitting in my seat!
Sincerely,
Joseph A. Bundy

To the Editor:

I would like to relate to you an
incident which happened to me and
countless other students, on Tues-
day, November 12.

I went to the Student Union in the
afternoon to pick up my ticket for

the Pitt-Penn State game. When I '

got to the ticket ofﬁce, I was
informed that there were no tickets
left! ‘

I did not then, nor do I now,
understand why tickets were not

of Pittsburgh, I feel I am entitled to

Any tickets left over
should then be offered to the
general public.

I was not even aware that a rush
for tickets existed. The Pitt News
simply stated that students would
receive a free ticket upon present-
ing an ID and current validation.
Nowhere was it- mentioned that
there was a limited amount of
student tickets available. In fact, it
stated that students would have
until November 22 to pick up their
tickets, 11 days after the tickets
first went on sale.

The most astonishing fact con-
cerning this unfortunate situation
is that although the game was a
sellout, 50,050 tickets to be exact,»
by Monday evening, November 11,
only 4,500 tickets (according to an

VSG Board member) were allotted

Black Week a '

 

BY KATHRYN KIMBALL

I ‘‘I'm black and I plan to be black
-the rest of my life. There have
been and will be struggles, but
- nobody’s going to keep me from
doing what I have to do...”
= The speaker was Pittsburgh Pirate
7 Willie Stargell addressing an
audience gathered for Black Athle-
" tics Recognition Night, part of this
year's annual Black Week celebra-
tion. Dr. Alfred Moye, vice
chancellor of student affairs pre-
, sented certiﬁcates to the black
athletes involved in various Uni-
versity sports.

Exploring the culture, being, and
inner selves of black people is what
this year’s Black Week theme
“Innervisions," is all about.

Stargell stressed the importance
of helping each other and “not
stepping on your brother’s toes” if

' - you should happen to be the one
out of 20 million athletes making it
, to the professionals.
‘ ’ ' Many doors are open to profes-
sional athletes, and Stargell hoped
' ‘anyone in the position would use it
' wisely.
Beginning a “rap session” with
' the audience, Stargell took on lively
arguments involving the question
of women's ability to participate in
professional sports, Joe Gilliam,
the Importance of education and
personal qualiﬁcation, and Star-
gell’s own memories of growing up
‘ in California eating oatmeal three
times a day.
Stargell ended with the words,

field."

Deputy Chairperson of the Black
Action Society (BAS) George Van
Hook said, “The purpose of this
week is to exemplify everything we
feel we are about. to deal with the
totality of- black experience, to
educate and to entertain both
blacks and whites. The‘ week is
also a celebration because we're
proud of our people and our
culture."

Through the activities planned
this week, BAS hopes to deal with
the divergence of black interests
and the different aspects of black
culture. “Every black on campus
should find. something satisfying
this week,” said Van Hook.

. Although BAS cannot totally
educate everyone in this short
time, “we hope people will look
into themselves more carefully,

that they will think more culturally;

and politically," said Van Hook.
“We hope to stimulate further
thought, and then we will reinforce
these thoughts through other
activities." '
Raising political consciousness is
the most important goal to Van
Hook. Video tapes of Angela Davis
and Stokely Carmichael, and a
lecture by Jack Daniel were among
the political events.
Daniel is former chairman of Pitt’s
black studies department. Daniel
urged a more careful examination
of the structure of the University
and better organization of blacks on
campus in a talk focused on black
genocide on a primarily white
campus.

opportunity for people of different
religions to come together. “I was

Editor’s note: As everyone must
know by now, after reading this
writer’s articles, the rock n’ roll
environment, as it were, plays an
important role in these critical
pieces. Not so apparent is the
influence of the journalism of
Rolling Stone...to the point where

it is blasphemy to wrinkle a copy of

it in front of him.

The following is‘ a collection of
reviews of concerts that have swept
the‘ city and now demand a
response. It is also an afterthought
...after reading Jon Landau’s Rock
1970: It’s Too Late To Stop Now
[l972, Straight Arrow Publishers,
Inc.) a rush of thoughts took over
his mind and one. quote in
particular stuck out. It’s this line
and the city ‘of Pittsburgh that
inspired this piece, “Rock and roll
is madness and the method that
has been imposed on it is too

rational, too business-like, and too" '

orderly, and if something doesn’t
break loose soon, it will kill off what
energy is left for a good long
time.”

It was to be the heavy rockin’,
event of the year...with Black Oak
Arkansas as top-liners...having
these three bands billed in one
show. Andafter I picked up the kid

behind me who was passed out in .

the aisle, I sat down to hear it.

ROBIN TOWER, his musicianship
was unquestionable, only the vital-
ity was lacking.

From Holland, and relatively new
to American ears, Golden ,Earring
presented a show that ranged from
“Radar Love" to softer tunes
reminiscent of early Jethro Tull,
featuring flute and turn-around
bass lines. The antics were extra,
because this band impressed me as

-a good performance group...the

theatrics~- added to the quality

musical abilities they displayedu \

Each member excelled. especially
the lead guitarist, with solo stints
on stage, without overpowering the
vocals. _
Robin Trower, on the other hand,
lacked the vitality that Earring
seemed to be overspiliing with...
musicianship was unquestionable,
but at times the energy level sent

. me togan abysmal ‘entropy state

FRANK ZAPPA: “the death of a
modern day imitator.”

\

FRANK ZAPPA
Syria Mosque, November 6
It used to say on Frank’s

albums[notice the casualness with

which his name is dropped]...“The —

modern day composer refuses to
die," by Edgar Varese. Well, as
most of us know by now, or
goddamn should know, there are
no modern day composers! Or at

least there shouldn't be, because-

all there is to expand upon [in
classical structure] has beenbuilt
upon and misused to the point
where Pictures At An Exhibition is
probably thought to be an ELP
song.

Too many people expect talent to
drool out of Zappa's songs. Too

 

many expect him to perform
perfectly each and every. night.
And too many listen to older works

and even pretend to expect that his

show might include such delicacies
as “King Kong," or even “Nasal
Retentive Caliope Music"...[keep-
ing on with the personal vendetta
against such TASTELESS readers],
well, forget it as cheese once said...

This Zappa concert was as
disastrous as his last three
albums...it lacked creativity and a
spark that used to mark a Zappa

contrasting, mindless shit that was
being laid down.

I must admit I got a little excited
when he did some variations on
“Uncle Meat Theme" [1 bet you
didn't even know that, huh?]
during the first show, and I must
also confess “Big Swifty”. got me
hot in the second performance. But
asidefrom that, and the female

ushers, I was pretty upset. Ed
' Townshend and I were to re_y_i_ew

this show but he is still recuper-
ating from the dry heaves (and
name dropping syndrome he fell
into with his Roxy. piece).

It’s too bad that Dennis, clever,

from that radio station ever played
a raped, distorted, disembodied,

'dy-hymaned version of “Yellow

Snow,” because it was at that
point...that very moment in time
that Frank Zappa became popular,
and at that very precise second, a
moment at which he discovered
that somebody other than a few
starving freaks and musicians, like
Jimmy Carl Black. might enjoy,...
no, no, no not enjoy...hear...his
music or comedy. I'm sorry for
him. The modern. day imitator has
died.

in the spaces left open.

While Poco’s set wasn't as
impressive as should be expected,
Roger's evening proved what many
have been saying for years, that he
was the driving force behind the
folk-rock era and the incarnation of
it in the Byrds. Using original
material ‘from his first album and
his latest Columbia LP Peace On
You and some old favorites, he
whetted the appetites of a few
thousand fans and pleased them
beyond belief.

One could never have anticipated
the reaction he received. The days
of good times are over and good
music is few and far between.
Bouncing along with Roger at the
Whiskey A—Go-Go is unfortunately
gone, but his spirit isn’t and his
tunes, have survived. I think more
than any other song “Eight Miles
High” captures the feeling of the
60’s. ‘ Not only were people
reaching for that levelibut some
were actually there...at times.

“So You Want To Be..." has been
the footnote to most criticism for
the past six years in‘ rock music.
He also revived the old Dylan,
wiping the blood off the tracks with
“You Ain't Goin’ Nowhere.” His
energy certainly hasn’t subsided
since “Fifth Dimension" and a new
LP is in the thought process that
should match the vivacious karma
of this Bill Halverson endeavor.

 Pitt Seeks Upset Over B

BY G.W. STEVENS
Associate Sports Editor I

There is not a lot anybody can say
about the Fighting Irish of Notre
Dame. They have consistently
been among the top 10 major
college football teams in the coun-
try and this year is obviously no
exception. Coming off a national

championship the Irish are once
again bou

meeting against -Alabama.

But the season isn’t over yet and
tomorrow’s game in South ‘Bend
will feature Pitt in a game with has
stirred up quite a bit of interest
among Pittsburgh and Notre Dame
fans alike.

Tomorrow's game has been sold
out sincejJuly as over 57,000 fans
converge on South Bend, with
Pitt'_s All-American Tony Dorsett

possibly the star attraction. But
despite TD's past performance
against the Irish (209 yards a year
ago) the Panthers are still 20-point
underdogs in the upcoming clash.
The Irish had an open date-last
week and have had more than
enough time to prepare for Pitt.
Irish coach Ara Parseghian used
the extra week to rest his players,
holding only light workouts last

week. ‘ He was hopeful that the_
extra time would enable the Irish to
get some injured players back in
the lineup. _
“We are hopeful that tacke Steve
Neece, defensive tackle Kevin
Nosbusch and tightend Robin‘ We-
ber can be ready for the Pitt
game,” said Parseghian. “None of
these players saw action against
Navy and I only hope we can count

‘ on their return this week.”

But even’witho_ut these players,
the Irish are still in excellent shape. ’
Their balanced offensive attack,
coupled with the nation's leading
defense, is sure to give Johnny
Majors and the Panther squad their
toughest game of the year.

The offense is led by quarterback
Tom Clements who is a leading
Heisman Trophy candidate. Cle-
ments, a senior from McKees
Rocks, PA is 86 for 153 in the
passing departmentfor over 1100
yards. He has added another 300
yards rushing and Pitt fans will
notice a similarity in his and Billy
Daniels’ style of play.

The Irish ground game centers
around the hard hitting running of
Wayne Bullock who was the key
factor in last year’s win over Pitt.
Bullock has fought his way for 691
yards so far this season on 168
carries. He’ ‘has gotten some
assistance in the Irish backfield
from senior Al Samuels, an early
season replacement for the injured
Eric Penick, who has compiled 423
yards on just 74 carries.

Clements is a very consistent
passer, throwing primarily to his

The Pitt players respect State’s

Chet Venanzi. “If we can score two
goals, Ipredict we'll win." Scoring
two goals against PSU may not be
easy for the Panthers, who were
shut out 1-0 by IUP last weekend,
despite outshooting them 25-10.

“We just haven’t been able to
stick in the goal and take the heat
off our defense,” said coach Leo
Bemis. The defense, like the team
as a whole, has been pleasantly
surprising to Bemis, but the heat is
likely to be on it again tonight.
“Penn State’s strength is in their
ability, to keep .a sustained
offense,” Bemis said, “but they
can be scored on.”

Leads Upset Minded Cats

   Daniels Satisfiedtlust Doing Job

Daniels, like everyone else on the ~

BY JIM SPANOS

After the game is over and the
scoreboard lights ﬂicker out at
Three Rivers Stadium on Thanks-
giving night, and when Billy
Daniels has thrown possibly his last
pass as a Pitt quarterback, the
“Daniels era” of Pitt football will

be over.
Like many Pitt signal callers
before him: such as Kenny Lucas,
Ed James, Frank Gustine, Jim
Friedl, John Hogan, and Dave
 Havern, Billy Daniels hasn’t re-
ceived much national publicity, and

     
   

BILL DANIELS will lead the upset minded Pitt Panthers against the

very little regional publicity as
well. But that doesn’t matter,
becapse Daniels himself is satisfied
with the way he has played. "
Daniels’ performance at quarter-
back the last two years has been an
integral part of the Pitt offense. He
has handled the option with auth-
ority, completing 59% of his passes
for 899 yards this year, and 48% as
a junior. , ,
Against Navy, Syracuse, and\
Temple, the Panth_ers needed a
touchdown late in the game, and
each time they came through. Last

heavily favored Fighting Irish tomorrow in South Bend. Daniels will be

week, with eight minutes left in the
game, and the Panthers backed up
on their own two yard line, Daniels
led the offense to a 98 yard scoring
drive which put the Cats ahead to
stay.

“This year, if the opposition gets
a touchdown, we just figure’ we’ll
go out and get another one,”
Daniels said. “When we were back
on the two against Temple, we just
we in the huddle...we knew what
haﬂto be done.”

Fighting back has been the trade-
mark of the Panthers this year, and
an amiable atmosphere certainly
won't greet the team in unfriendly
Notre Dame stadium, where losing
a football gameis a tantamount to
skipping church two weeks in
succession. A possible bowl bid
and eight tons of pride are at stake.
but Daniels doesn’t feel any pres-
sure. '

“Last year I had a bad game,”
admits the senior from Montour.
“But you just have to learn from
your mistakes. I don't feel that I'm
under any pressure to make up for
last year. I’m just going to go out
there and do the best I can.”

ed Pitt. He’s proud of the way the —

team has progressed since the
beginning of the season, their 7-2
record, and the fact that they have
a good chance to win the last two
games. ‘But in Daniels’ view,
beating Notre Dame and Penn
State are more important than
going to a bowl. \

“To beat Notre Dame and Penn
State would make the season," he
said, in the honest manner, which
is as much a part of Bill Daniels as
the way he throws a football.

Pitt has thrown the ball an
average of 13 times per game this
year, but against the Irish they will
probably have to rely on their
passing attack with more regular-
ity. And if Daniels picks apart the
Notre Dame zone defense, don't be
surprised.

“As long as we move the ball, I
don’t care if we throw the ball two

“Sometimes I’d like to throw the
ball more often on first and 10, but
