‘It’ Blew A Sad Commentary

By GEORGE_LIES
Associate Editor

FARMINGTON; W.VA.—— The wind
pushed the tattered American Red Cross
coffee cup across the parking lot, across
the narrow cement road. and rolled it
over the cliff edge down into the Number
Nine’ shaft hole. The wind whipped the
red>e%ossed flag, and swept through the
opened door of the Champion Store.‘ It
rustled the cellophane of the now pushed-
aside Christmas decorations, and chilled
all those inside the store. —

But no one noticed the wind.

The mind was on Athals, Llewellyn,
and M'od’s Run. The mind was on 78
men, entombed men. The mind was on

death. and it could only wait.

The mind didn’t even see the small.
red house, set way back on a deep ‘green
mountain-"side. But it saw the faces of
relatives, friends, husbands, and sons. All

those were 600 feet below the ground; '

trapped.
The mind became a deep-red, blood-

shot eye: a watery brook. It saw only‘

Number-Nine, the spot that one passed-
by nonchalantly only two days before.

Now, as one might stare at a deathly

painting, the red eye stared down into B

the black hole.

Tony Boyle spoke. He was President of
the United Mine Workers of America.

Dressed neatly and blackly, as is fit for
a funeral, Mr. Tony Boyle spoke. In
thestoreroom, the wear-room where boots
and shoes and stored items had no chance

’with so many cameras flashing and whin-

ning, Mr. Tony Boyle spoke.

“I’m not here to give orders,” Mr.
Boyle said to the press. “I’m not here as

an expert on mine operations. “I’m here '

to express the sympathy of the United
Mine‘ Workers of America. Their sym-
pathy.” _

Outside the room. beyond camera

, range, the people gathered. Their faces.
While life died, and hopes shook, Mr. .

the ones that never change in times of
disaster, the ones that seem ever so fam-
iliar. were strong.

“It’s a sad commentary,” Mr. Boyle
told the press. “That this has to happen
anywhere. Especially here in one of the
better companies, where there is safety
and cooperation to work with. I would
have been here yesterday, if it was pos-
sible.” - '

The nurse-aides had been awake all
night, and all morning. “Many of the men
who are trapped are sons of the men who
lost their lives in 1954,” said the short,
black-haired one. '

“I share the grief,” Mr. Boyle admon-
ished to the press. “I lost relations. There

V always is the inherit danger.”

A thin, dark-haired woman approach-

By DAVID TIERNAN
. Staff News Editor,

FARMINGTON, W.Va. — Butch will never be
a student at Pitt.

I’ll probably end up in the mines. like my
father,” Butch said as he stared at a bottle of
shampoo on the shelf of the Champion Coal Com-
pany Store. He. along with hundreds of other
friends and relatives. was waiting to hear an op--
timistic word about the 78 miners who were trap-
ped in the coal mine a few miles away.

“They try to keep their spirits up,” he said.
looking at some of the others. They were huddled
in groups of four or five, talkingiin low voices.
Their faces all bore the same expression as Butch’s:
sad. taut, weary; but their eyes told the whole
story. Many had kept the 36 hour vigil waiting for
news of the trapped men, and their eyes were red

and swollen from lack of rest and crying.

“We’re like a country of our own,” Butch noted.
“We live our lives in our own little ways during
regular times; this is like a country in war—all
the people come together to help each other.”

Butch is 18. and said he couldn’t remember the
disaster in 1954 which claimed_ the lives of 16
miners. He also explained that after his gradua-
tion from high school in June, he applied to work
in the very mine that now held the 78 men cap-

tive. “I could have been working the midnight .

shift. too,” he said. “Most of the new workers
start of on midnight."

Although he had no relatives trapped in the
mine, six of his friends were down there. “My
father should have been down there, too,” Butch
said. “He was going to switch shifts with a
friend so we could go hunting today. He changed

his regular daylight. s_hift.’’‘ ;

 

..: .r.'. '

his mind at,the last minute‘ and decided to work .

 

  

Butch waits with his father.

“The mines are all we have,” Butch reflected.
“Many of us want to get away, but in order to get
enough money, we must work in the mines for two
or three years. By then we have forgotten . . ” he
trailed off as an older lady behind him began to
sob loudly. '

In his conversation, Butch explained the com-
plex labyrinth of tunnels as’ most kids his age

"might, explain the single wing. or the table of

chemical elements. Between the lines of his ex-
planation. however. was the pessimismthat was
evident on the others’ faces} He also explained

.the gases. explosions, and fires that were hamper-

ing rescue attempts.

V“The waiting is the hardest part of this for
us,” Butch added after a pause. “If there were

only something we could do besides justastand-

ing around waiting  .”. Again his voice ‘became

» lives in the 1954 disaster. Butch explained .that C’
families who lose their father do not move away, .

even though the Company pays them insurance.

“They have no place to go,” Butch said of the e 
fatherless families. “They have probably lived
here for generations. This is the only life they

know. To them the mines are the only work their

families have done since they came to this coun-7.

try.

When asked about the total number of miners

employed in the mines, Butch called his father ~,

for an answer. The only response was a sharp re-.

ply of “Around 500”, accompanied by a hard,’
coldglare. His father did not welcome the re- ..

porters as Butch did. To Butch’s father, we were

intruders in his ‘country’. And, although Butch 
' welcomed the chance (even in the face of crisis.) ‘
to talk to people from another ‘country’, he related .
everything about the people, young and old alike,gg< .

to the mines. '

Butch accepted the reality of a mining disas-I'll

ter. He faced the reality of his future in the mines.

He said that the hardest part of the crisis for the ' A, ,
people was the waiting—the helpless, hopeless" 

waiting. For the majority of people, the waiting
was just time until the deaths of the men would be
confirmed. ‘Few, if any, were blindly optimistic
about the survival of the miners. They, too,‘ ac-

cepted the disaster as one of the dangers of the .

mines.
No, Butch will never be a’student at P_itt. His

future is decided. All there is_ for him now is the).

mines and the waiting—the hopeless, helpless wait-

ing for the day when he no longer “Owes his”
soul ‘to’ thelCompa'ny store”. But for Butch, that
-_day'willnever come. ' ’  I   ’ ’

 

During his conversation, Butch constantly’ re- 
ferred to his father, who was standing between »
the frozen food and toy shelves in the next aisle. j C

SG Bill Says:

by PEGGY ALLEN

After a second week of de-
liberation, the SG Senate pas-
sed a resolution Wednesday
night recommending the re-
moval of acfreditation from
ROTC at the University. “The
real import of this resolution
lies in the realization that,
while the ROTC programs may
be advantageous for male
students to take, its present
structure and operation
makes it fundamentally in-
consistent with the notion
of “an academic field of stu-

dy, academic freedom, and
the “aims and philosophy of
a liberal arts education.”

The bill, which was passed
by a vote of 117, states
that since academic control of
ROTC rests with the Defense
Departxnt and not with the
Uiversity and,since “there
are considerable other advan-
-tages ‘or, motivations to tak-
ing ROTC (i.e., pay, commis-
sion upon graduation) that
are not available in- any other
course at the University,”
SG recommends that credit

 

 

not be given for ROTC par-
ticipation.

Joe Kociubes, chairman of
the Cabinate of Arts and Sci-
ences, was very pleased with
the bill. “Any group with any
jurisdiction on the campus
has passed thesame recom-
mendation about ROTC. This
verifies in my mind that the
fact that this issue is. a very
clear cut thing — it is not
even debatable.”

Scott Baum,‘ Chairman of
the Legal Awareness Com-
mittee (LAC), also spoke at

‘Thought’ Features UMP’s Bouie Haden

By DAVE KUHNS
Staff News Writer
“We want the radicals and
revolutionaries, the college stu-
dents, the citizens of the com-
munities, both young and old, to
organize city-wide. If there are
enough people who care then
let’s do something about it!”
In these words William “Bou-
ie” Haden, president of the Unit-
ed Movement for Progress
(UMP), has outlined his a.p-

proach to the crisis of social op-
pression which daily confronts
the Black residents of Pitts-
burgh. .

Students and faculty will have
the opportunity to hear Mr: Ha-
den elaborate on his proposed so-
lution this Friday as Project
Thought’s weekly group discus-
sion session moves to consider
“The University as It Relates
to the Community.”

Haden became active

in the _.

organized fight against social in-
justice in May of 1967 “when I
realized that the so-called civil
rights movement was dead and
nothing was happening.”
Through his efforts the UMP
was born and today combats such
problems as poor housing condi-
tions and police brutality. In ad-
dition to his duties aspresident
of UMP, healso serves as editor
of the organization’s new paper
the Thrust. , .,

The UMP’s activities have
produced “a few mild victories,”
but significant progress has wan-
ed due to lack of mass organized
community support. Well aware
of this fact, Haden has observed
that “without unit‘y,_ even violent
action won’t’bring about change.
But we can’t wait for a vast ma-

jority; we’ve got to work with
what we have.” ‘

SDS Hogwash

There have been a number of small confrontations on
campus this week, and they have been inspired not onlv bv
the ROTC controversy, but by the presence of Students for
a Democratic Society (SDS).

While SDS has been in existence for a number of years,
it was only this fall that the organization was born on this
campus. Before that most of the activist sentiment here was
voiced by Students For Peace. Yet, the specter of SDS and its

fears to the students, faculty and administration. And now
SDS has become the whipping boy of all students believing
in national plots to disrupt the campuses of the nation. In
short, students here have, in past months. expressed their fear
of violent disruption at the University by the“subversive
rascals” who consitute the membership of SDS.

It is quite hard, however, to be concerned about SDS’s
threat to the tranquilty of the University or to the society,
for SDS isn’t even a thorn in our flesh; it is more like a fest-
ering tick that has been partially crushed — squirms for
its life.

The concept of “participatory democracy” is an ideal that
is seemingly in step with the _ tenets of SDS. But this
1 guise is shortlived when .each and every member of the or-
ganization is teamed a “leader.” When this is the case, all the
‘conflicting ideologies of the left surface, and ‘the result is
organizational chaos. At the University, SDS has not been re-
sponsible for any major constructive innovations. Indeed, its
existence has been short in terms of time, but its meetings,
have accomplished little if anything. The meetings of SIDS,
C in general, revolve around a discussion of goals and tactics.
. These discussions are endless and pointless.‘ ‘

The dark cloack of “participatory democracy” caused the
decay of the ill-fated Committee of Concerned Students. At
-one meeting the group almost split up over a decision to de-
, monstrate. As the “participatory” debate wore on, more and
. more “concerned students” left the procedings.

Aside from the failure of participatory democracy, SDS
suffers from ideological irrationality. They don’t believe in
mapping a program to be put into effect after they achieve
the “free society.” It is argued that during confrontations,
the solutions will present themselves. This can be dismissed

pus certainly don’t qualify as magicians.

The verbal aspersions voiced by SDS mean next to
nothing without an organization structure to back up their,de-
.mands. And SDS demands become mockery, when they are
not backed up by rational and realisticalternatives for change.

Dean Computer 

by 908938M
Staff News Editor

Number 908938M walked down
the halls of the ninth floor of
the Cathedral, past the large
television screen mounted high on
the wall, and into the office. He
knocked on the door, walked in,
and took a seat across from the
Dean.

“Good afternoon, Dean Com-
puter,” 908938M said.

“Good . . . afternoon,” Dean
Computer replied.

“I have a problem, sir.”

“Everyone . . . . has . . . . pro-
blems,” the machine responded.

“But, sir, this is a problem with-
in your department. I want to
withdraw from a course,” 908938M

pleaded.

“You. ...may....not...._
withdraw . . . . . from . . . . . . . .
courses . . . . . after . . . . . Octo-

ber 16,” the voice from the ma-
chine’s speaker beamed.

“Well, sir, I had to switch
course because of a schedule con-
flict, and I missed some classes
because of work while the trans-
fer cards were being processed.
Then I took the first test two class
meetings after I entered the new
class, and I didn’t do too well. I
went to the professor and we had
a talk. He decided that it wasn't

fair to the other students .for me

to make the work up with an out— _

  Carrot-Slob

of-class paper, so he advised me to
drop the course and take it next
term when I can schedule it at a
decent hour,” 908938M spouted.

Dean Computer waited a few
minutes for the information to be
processed in his mechanical brain.
then responded. “You . . . may . . .

only . . . withdraw . . . for .
medical . . . reasons . . . It
;says...so...in..the..
Catalogue.”

“Well what’s the purpose of
this office if you merely regurgi-
tate the rules in the Catalogue.
Aren’t there any exceptions to the
rules? My professor advised me to
withdraw from the course. What
more do you need?”

Again the out-of-the-ordinary
question required the machine to

process the information for a‘

few minutes before answering.
“Yes...we. .make...ex-
ceptions,” Dean Computer fin-
ally replied. “We . . . are . . . not
...biased..We ...know...
who...you...are..You...
are . . .908938M.”

“I don’t care if you know who I
am,” 908938M. said. “To tell you
the truth, I really don’t care if
you. allow me to drop the course
or not. I merely came up here be-
cause my professor advised me to
withdraw from the course,” 90-
8938M said.

Dean Computer was stunned. In-

waited for a reply. ‘He will pro-

908938M thought. But he was
shocked when Dean Computer
replied.

“I am not the machine you may
think I am,” the machine said.
“I have only been here a short
time and must comply with the
rules. I am only an assistant.”

‘A tape-recording’ 908938M
thought. One which is pro-
grammed to run when certain
questions are raised or. which the
Catalogue has no answer.’

“Just because the Establish-
ment dictates policies to you, and
monitors your actions on the tele-
vision screen, don’t you feel some-
one should challenge them on some

of their policies?” 908938M asked.
“Why . . . should . . . I . . .1?”
the Dean responded. “I . . . am

‘I bet it does,’ 908938M thought,
as he walked out of the office and
past the television screen on the

Spleen-Type Review

But Carrot merely taunts them by calmly reply-
ing, “Naa, naa, you can’t have any, you peasants.”

- by MARC SIMON

* Staff Columnist

A Last night the University Theatre of the Abon-
niable gave its premier performance of Peter Rabbit’s
play, Carrot-Slob, or, as it is known by its full name,
Slob. To my knowledge, this play had never before
been performed anywhere elsein the U. S. of A.,
and I sincerely hope it never will be. In fact, jud-
ging from the acting and staging of the play, it
looked as if the Theatre of the Abominable had
never performed it until last night,‘either.

Slob is a product of the Blechtian Theate. It
makes the audience quiet, queasy, and then sick by
shocking it with its unusual style. It arrouses
audience by shooting real flame-throwers at it, play-
ing Lawrence Welk albums, and pulling taffy right
on the stage. But let’s get to the action of the play.

The play is set at the outskirts of that famous
Polish town, Czarnecki, in the year 1808. The act-
ing takes place in a public bath, and all the chara—c-
ters are bathing except for Carrot, who is lock-
ed in a cell, eating, appropriately enough, an apple.
Through the play Carrot constantly tortures the bath-
ers. They sing, “Carrot we’re Hungry, and the Hun-
gry stay Hungry We want a bit of apple now! ’ ’i

To the student, and especially

While 3 81'0WiI18 Number Of C0n- here at Pitt, the issues revolving

   
  
   
  
  
 
    
   

: cemed citizens, along with the
. academic community, have be-
? come increasingly aware of the

divisions in this country due to

" the racial crisis, the plight of mi-
, grant farm workers has long gone
i unnoticed.

‘In a country where the black

'_man has been denied his rights
Lsfor over 100 years, and the Am-
,erican Indian has been -forced

to live on crowded, dirty reserva-

,:»tions in a state which befits
 something less than a human be-
"1 ing, it is easy to see why this

as been so. Their cause, how-
ver, has recently come to light
ecause of the California Grape
oycott.

 

around the migrant farm work-
er’s strike and the resulting grape
boycott have been hazy or com-
pletely unhear of.

Migrant farm worker’s, many
of them Mexican-Americans,
working in the fields of Califor-
nia, are our’ present day slaves.
They do not have protection
from the federal government and
they have been denied the right
to organize by the AFL-CIO,
Farm laborers are not even cover-

ed by the National Labor Rela- *

tions Act.

Because of the practices in-
volved in crop spraying, mi-
grant workers are highly sus-

‘ ceptable to diseases such as 'tu-

berculosis. They have no medical

   

benefits either, nor do their
children have an opportunity for
equal education. And -how could
they possibly have good, clean,
warm homes when their average
income is just a little over two
thousand dollars a year.

Students may ask themselves
how they can help a cause which
seems so remote. There is an im-
mediate way that this can be
done. And that is to take part
in the march and demonstration

to held Saturday in support of

the Grape Boycott.

The issue of the California
Grape Boycott does not re-
volve around any particular poli-
tical ideology. nor does. it re-
present the advocation of any
specific organization’s aims. The
entire issue is the only procur-"

ring of the essential rights of these
migrant workers. the question is
man’s status as a human being,
and the concern is the welfare of
men, women, and children who
have been denied these rights.

Of the many perplexing pro-
blems facing America today, the
racial crisis is of upmost impor-
tance. And the key to the solu-
tion of the racial problem is un-
derstanding. Black and white
people in this country are not
tending to move towards seper-
ate societies.

Because the cause of the Cal-

_ifornia Grape Boycott is im-

mediate, the effect that we can
help to produce, by taking part
in. the demonstration, is im-
mediate. Not only will we be
helping the cause of an unfortu-

nate group of people but we will-

 

This basically all that happens in "the play until
the end, when Chocola the Corduroy (admirably
played by Mary Robbs Cars), who is the secret
daughter of Shotgun De Slade, steals Carrot’s apples.
She says she is going off “to create a better turn-
over,” thus symbolizing man’s inhumanity to man,
modern society’s alienation of the sheperd, and the
search for identity which all of us undergo.

. But the philosophical side of this play really
comes out in Shotgun De Slades conversation
with Carrot. They debate the urgent questions of
our times. The high point of their discussion comes
when De Slade says, “Gimme a bite of that apple
or I’ll get Chocolate Cordury to whip me.” But"
Carrot profoundly replies, “An apple a day keeps
the doctor away.”

I wouldﬂadvise everyone to go see this play. It
is an experience in total garbage. However, due to
the high cost of fruit, last night’s performance was
the last one. Luckily for us, though, the Theatre
of the Abominable will open again next year with a
production of Bi-rdy Blech’s The School-Yard Mar-
ble-Shooting Circle. Don’t miss it.

Grape Boycott March Tomorrow

be working in an area that has as
it’s goal the eventual unification
of all people in the search for
humaii liberties.

This is an appeal to the stu-
dents and faculty at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh to show
their support for the effort of
the migrant workers to achieve‘
what is only theirs.

Maybe. because of.a small act
of conscience, a little girl might

be able to wear some decent ,

clothes, or an entire family might
be able to live in a decent home,
or maybe these same children will
really be able to have the right
to equal education. Only‘ the fu-
ture will be able to tell, but we
can atleast make an effort in sup-
port of these people, so that some-
day they may be free from toil-
ing in the tenure of the “grapes
of wrath ”

Editor, PITT NEWS,

I had hoped that I would not
have to write any more state-
ments concerning my observa-
tions on last Friday’s incident,
but I find Mr. Robert Ru-
dolph’s statement misleading and‘
untrue. I write this to clarify the
situation.

Rosenblum Not Learning Much;
Ideas Not Superior to Prof’ 5

Editor, PITT NEWS:

Mr. Rosenblum’s column in Friday’s issue of The Pitt News
deserves a lot of irate criticism from the University's professors —
Ihope he gets it. - -

Any student owes it to himself to attend lectures and hear the views
of his professor and fellow classmates, whether he agreesvor not. He
should not assume his ideas are necessarily superior to those of his
teacher, who has had a little more education and who has done a little
more research. I

If Mr. Rosenblum insists on retaining only the obvious from his
readings, he isn’t learning very much. And if he chooses to relate,ob-
vious facts on his tests, he isn’t being very original. A English pro-
fessor has the right to demand a little creativity —and' sometimes
a suggestion can be the stimulus for a good, solid, new idea. If Mr. Ro-
senblum is only interested in his own thoughts, he should become a her-
mit and forget civilizationl ‘

think it is quite proper for stu-
dents to infer that Pershing Ri-
fes (Mr. Rudolph’s “Organiza-
ton”") is involved in the incident.

plicity of PR members in the

I would like to take this oppor-
tunity to comment upon two dia-
metrically opposite philosophies
which could have been deducted
from two articles appearing in

the respective. editors are into
completey different stages of
thought. _

Staff Columnist, David Rsen-
blum, wrote an article to hit both
the machine-like thinking peo-
ple, whether they be students
or professors. The article was
actually a plea for all to have
the courage to assert his own
original ideas and to refuse to
submit to the programmed
thought vacuum.

It was ironic to read the pro-

at-Sade written by Marc Smon.
He spoke of the play not being

we are accustomed.” It may not
be the norm but it is not “bom—
barded with a succession of what
can only be called bizarre events
on stage” as he says: If anyone
can think in more than one di-
mension he can see these so call-
ed bizarre events as a mirror of
himself in reality. The play was

Policy Statement

To fulfill our functions_as ,a
Legal Awareness Committee,
wepresent the following state-
ments inspired by NSA and we
suggest that they be evaluated
in terms of the University and
implemented to their fullest ex-
tent:

We recognize the right of the
University to admit students in
keeping with their enrollment
capacity and specific enrollment
requirements with the under-
standing that there will be no dis-
crimination on the basis of race,
religion or sex.

We recognize theright of every
student to participate in the pol-
icy-decision-making process of
the University. '

The LAC understands that cer-
tain such programs already exist
at the University and we recom-
mend that they be strengthened
and that more be established.

We recognize the right of ev-

ery student to conduct research

freely, and to publish, discuss,
and exchange findings and recom-
mendations.

We recognize the right of the
student community to determine
its own social rules and code of
conduct

We recognize the right of every
student to participate through
his student government in setting
up activity fees and in allocat-
ing these fees and other activity
fees.

We recognize the right of every
student organization to choose
or approve its own faculty advis-
or. However, when none consents
to serve and an administrator is
required. the organization should
continue to function while con-
scientiously seeking one.

We recognize the right of every
student to establish and issue stu-
dent-directed publications free of
any student government, faculty
and-or administrative censor-
ship or pressure aimed at con-
trolling editorial policy or staff
appointments and removals.
. The LAC realizes that the first
steps have been taken toward
this freedom at the Unirsity.

We recognize the right of ery
student to freely exrcise his full
rights‘as a citizen. He may pub-
lish and distribute his views with-
out impairing his standing in the
institution, provided he does not
claim to represent that institu-
tionlthe LAC strongly suggests
that ltudents thexelves respect
these rights in regard to other
students. ,

student to be completely unham-
pered in his pursuit of knowledge
ther on or off campus. To this
end, no administrative files deal-
ing with personal belief or mem-
bership shall be compiled.

A statement found in a book-
let" published by the American
Civil Liberties Union, “Academ-
ic Freedom and Civil Lberties
of Students in Colleges and Uni-
versities.” recommends that
“Regulations governing the be-
havior of students should be fully
and clearly formulated, publish-
ed. and made available to the
whole community. They should
be reasonable and realistic. As a
rule. specific definitions are pref-
erable to such general criteria
as ‘conduct unbecoming a stu-
dent’ or ‘against the best inter-
institution,’ which
allow for a wide latitude of inter-
pretation. ”

The LAC strongly recom-
mends— that the administration
supply the students with such
a statement as soon as possible.
Fulfillment of the preceding
rights would guarantee the stu-
dent the right of protection from
any unreasonable and arbitrary
action by members of the fac-
ulty and-or the administration.

The University must, recog-
nize that status as a student is
sometimes irrelevant to status
as a private citizen. In the pri-
vate status, he should not be sub-
ject to punitive measures by the
college, unless the college can
prove that he has acted in a way
which adversely affects or ser-
iously interferes with its nor-
mal educational functions, or

which injures or endangers the .

welfare of any of its other mem-
bers. ~

These recommendations are
submitted by the LAC in fulfill-
ment of its function to make stu-
dents and faculty aware of their
legal rights. The exercising of
these rights make ‘certain re-
sponsibilities incumbent on the
students:

—- The student has the respon-
sibility to devote himself to edu-
cation, realizing that it is a to-
tal process which requires not
only the accumulation of facts,
concepts and methods of inquiry,
but also the gaining of an under-
standing of society and his unique
role in that society.

— We recognize the student’s
responsibility to make‘ himself
cognizant of the regulations of
his institution and to comply with
them. Yet, he must also have a
responsibility to question these
regulations and to offer construc-
tive criticism of the institution’s
academic and non-academic pol-
icies.

In accordance with this state-
ment, tlie LAC recognizes the
student’s responsibility to work
in his institution, even in the ab-

sence of formal law, for the elim-.

ination of discrimination on the
basis of race, national origin,

LAC Asserts Student Rights

or creed, the latter except in the
case of an institution which re-
quires membership in a religious
denomination for admission.

We recognize the student’s
responsibility to be aware of and
to use all existing channels of
communication in pursuind re-
dress of grievances.

The LAC is well aware of the
existence of these channels of
communication and also of their
obscurity.

In conclusion. the LAC has
found many of these rights to be
either nonexistent or not fully re-
cognized and implimented at the
University. We therefore sub-
mit this statement of rights in
order to foster an awareness lead-
ing to an active participation of the
student body in the exercising of
their individual rights.

ler, Bill Sahr, and Peggy Allen.

Friday, November 22, 1968--THE PITT 

  M88“ '
Eli}-will

   

_Dear Mr. DeYoung :

The urban blight, because of its
concomitant insurgency of ‘the city
dweller, has finally been thrust before the
all-too-unwilling eyes of the American
public. Studies indicate that to alleviate
the problem, we should spend many
billions on our cities within the next
decade. The problem grows worse daily;
however, business resists government
intervention and control. ‘

Our _skies are filthy with smog, smoke,
soot, and stench; yet only legislation could
force industry to place antipollution
devices on its automotive products and
the same seems true for its smokestacks.
Our rivers are already fetid conduits;

yet, for purely economic reasons, industry

"continues to dump its noxious

by-products into public waters rather
than otherwise dispose of them.

Our cities are a snarl of transportation
congestion, yet business solves that
problem by merely running away to

develop new branches in unaffected areas.»

Our urban housing is often unfit for
habitation; yet, rather than redevelop
close-in housing and recreation for its
employees and potential customers,
business does nothing until government
urban renewal takes charge——then
business complains of waste, graft,
inefficiency, and intrusion upo

free enterprise. ‘

What evidence of civic responsibility
extending beyond the stockholder does
business show? When will business
relinquishrits myopic view of "PROFIT
NOW!" in favor’ of long-term benefits?
can you, as a businessman, feel proud of
business’ record on these important issues?

Yours truly7//\/} b  /

Mark Bookspan
Pre-Med, Ohio State _

 

Dear Mr. Bookspan:

Unquestionably our central cities
are faced with the explosive pressures
being built by the interacting
ills of slum housing, relative poverty,
hard_-core.une‘r‘nployment. traffic con-
gestion. air and water pollution. These

_are not new problems. but the urgent
demand _for solution is underscored by the
many episodes of readily-triggered violence
now so commonly seen.

Yet paradoxically. as these crises worsened.
our overall economy has witnessed
unparalleled productivity, higher ‘_
employment. and better living standards
for the larger majority of our population
than ever in history.

In turn, this has precipitated a trek to
suburbia of such proportion that many
downtown residential areas have been
virtually abandoned to a highly explosive.
usually non-white.‘ residual population.

_ There are no pat solutions to these

_ problems. Consider for a moment the
magnitude ofthe efforts during the past
thirty. years relative to urban renewal.
public housing. and the war on poverty.
The results have fallen far short of the
expectations voiced by those who

a advocated massive publicspending and

the multiplication of additional govern-
mental agency programming. In this
context. 1 think it is-not an exaggeration
to say that the. defining of goals for the
community, and the determination of the
means for their achievement. was
regarded strictly as governmental pre-
rogative and strictly outside of

business’ purview.

Yet there is now an increasingly vocal
ground swell that private industry
somehow holds the key to solving the
‘more pressing urban problems—if only
. its attention can be diverted from its
,"blind pursuityof profits." and its
social conscience awakened.

As Kenneth Clark. the well-known Negro
psychologist, has said: "Business and
industry are our last hopes because they
are the most realistic elements of our
society."

To assess the collective activities of
business throughout the nation, in
developing and implementing practicable
solutions for varying aspects of urban _
problems, ismanifestly impossible. But
let me mention a number of typical
examples in the field of air and water
pollution. ‘

The auto, steel. oil, rubber, lumber, paper,
and chemical industries.,to name a few,
have expended literally billions of dollars
in applied research and in the installation

of mechanical apparatus for the appreciable

reduction of smog. noxious fumes. dust.
silt. and other air and water pollutants.
Examples: the steel industry in the
Chicago area has eliminated 27,000 tons
of the 88.000 tons of particulate matter
that accumulates annually to aggravate the
city's air problem . . . Chrysler, Fordand
General Motors have programs ranging
from the control of fumes given off in
painting auto bodies. and water pollutants
from chromeplating processes. to dust

‘ our entire economy.

collectors at foundries. to intense research" V
for economicany practical auto exhaust
controls . . . crown Zellerbach has ' - F
developed rnearls to eliminate 90--per cent  i
of the solidsaind 98 per cent of the-
hydrogen sulphide from gases leaving its
kraft mills - - -- - »

Dow chemical has instituted various
successful methods to reduce water ,
pollution from industri_al plantwastes. and;
to reclaim certain types of ponds and

natural streams . . . In Goodyear, installa-
tion of a $750,000 waste water treatment . __
system at our facilities in Gadsden. , ‘
Alabama. assures purification of millions _

of gallons daily before return to the

Coosa River. Moreover. air and water
pollution control equipment is being , I ; ;
installed in some eight otherplants, while i
all new facilities under construction. or V .
those recently.built, have such controls in ~
their specifications. All of this has been
done voluntarily. Does this action bespeak
of "Profits Now." as you suggest?

‘ But industry isn't the only source of air

and water pollution. much needs to be
done in the areas of public and private
housing. sewage control. and garbage
disposal-—j’ust to name a few. ’ r

1

Slum housing. hard-core unemployment,
education. and traffic congestion also are ‘
the focus of direct business involvement.

In short, business is responding to the ‘-
challenge of the times by channelingsome  "
of its capabilities directly to public sector. 
requirements. Westinghouse, alone, is
spending millions in this area and the list

of others is considerable. .

Business’ success in such programs results > fj-
solely from capabilities which have. been _
perfected through the disciplinespf our 
free enterprise system. Business’ irjea|,for_te "
lies in its effective meeting of customer
needs and demands by the translation

of creative research, production abilities.

and resources through managerial skills
under the incentive of profit-making. The
profits generated as _a result of this

process provide the underpinnings o

In other words. business is in business to
make a profit. It is only through the-
accrual of profits that funds. are available
‘for all social improvement programs. ~ _.
whether originated by the public sector. 0
at the instance of business’ own
initiative, or jointly with government.

A thorough appraisal of the record. there-

community—~both on its own and in 4
concert with go,vernment—is developing,
underwriting. and implementing. viable
efforts to solve the problems which you
rightfully say demand attention. In terms

The case of the missing Alternatives took an
interesting twist Tuesday when a few members of
ROTC discovered the inscription of obscene words

relating to President-Elect Richard Nixon micro-,.
scopically printed within the artwork of the cover;
of issue number three. This information was relay-5
ed to District Attorney Robert Duggan by Jack;
LaP-ietra, president of the ROTC brigade. It was’

also brought to the attention of Dean of Students
N. Ronald Pease, who is trying to settle the whole
issue.

On Tuesday, Pease held a meeting with Glenn
Dolfi, the alleged leader of the theft of the Alter-
natives, and principle witnesses to the alleged
crime who presented Pease with signed statements.
In an interview with the Pitt News held Thurs-
day morning, Dean Pease declined to reveal much
information relating to the theft because the case

has not yet been closed. Pease indicated that the
issue should be solved by Monday and that appro-
priate disciplinary action will be taken if a theft
has indeed occurred.

There are ow two main aspects to this contro-

versy. One is the alleged theft itself. The other is
the question of freedom of speech versus license.
“This issue is as important (as the theft) if not
more important in the final analysis of the Univer-
sity Community,” said Pease, “because we are now
evaluating free speech. It must be defined.” Pease
feels that this evaluation could have far reaching
effects not only on this campus but at Univer-
sities throughout the country.

On Wednesday, Pease met with the editors of
Alternatives; Ken Holecko, Lew Taffer, Alan Dis-

until they get a gold watch and a pension.
There’s a lot to be done. Interesting,

ciplinary action. Instead, the problem is being re-
ferred to the Publications Board and the Committee
on Student Organizations (formerly ‘Student Recog-
nitions Committee). The future of the publication

- maybe in jeopardy because of its temporary recog-

nition status. The editors of Alternatives have con-
acted the American Civil Liberties Union to aid
hem in their case.

Dean Pease feels that four issues are involved,
in the case: the accused individuals, the accused
group (Pershing Rifles), the theft, and the obscen-
ity. “My initial primary concern,” said Pease, “was
that one student had indeed been threatened by an-
other.” He indicated that Dolfi admitted to making
the threat, but that “it was not a genuine promise
of future violence on his part.” Pease feels that
there is reason to believe that a small number of
individuals may have been involved in an impound-
ing but that it was nota group venture.

 Students Voice Decentralization Support

   
 

New York City Schools

Urban Affairs graduate students at
the University are organizing support
for New York City’s Ocean Hill-
Brownsville Governing Board.

Elected by the predominantly Ne-
gro and Puerto Rican experimental
district, the board was suspended Sun-
day by Mayor John Lindsay to reopen-
other New York City schools. Tues-
day, the Student Association of the
Department of Urban Affairs at the

University passed the following reso-
lution: _ 4

BE IT RESOLVED: that we of the
University ‘of Pittsburgh Urban Af-

fairs Student Association and oth-
ers undersigned hereby support the

Ocean Hill-Brownsville _Governing
Board in New York City we strongly endor
of decentralization of schools as exem-
plified by the Ocean Hill-Browns-
ville Experimentalschool District
In the best interests of the total com-
munity, parents should have decision-
making power in planning the education
of their children.

We note that the Ocean H11-
Brownsville board, in its brief existence,
has led an inspired (and integrated) fac-
ulty in unpreceded strides towards mak-

ing education a reality in the ghetto. =

Friday, November 22, 1968-—THE pm NEws—.Pa.ge '9 I E 

We regret that Mayor John Lind-
say thought it necessary to agree to the
suspension of the Ocean Hill-Browns-
ville Governing Board and three of
the district’s principals. We are sorry
the mayor allowed Albert Shanker’s

leadership to dictate policy in Ocean

Hill-Brownsville contrary to the will
of the people of Ocean Hill-Browns-
ville. Let us not forget that government
derives its just powers from ‘the consent
of the governed.

Finally, we believe that such pro-

grams ‘as that in Ocean Hill-Browns- ’
ville are important in creating agposi-_—

tive and'productive urban government.‘

Therefore we the undersigned
offer our active support to the Ocean
Hill-Brownsville Governing Board
in its struggle to defend its mandate
from the people of the neighborhood.

The students are seeking support ' I
‘ for the resolution from other groups

and individuals at the University and in
the Pittsburgh area.-They also plan to

contact urban affairs students all ov_er=

the country if their assistance is wanted
by the Ocean Hill-Brownsville Gov-

..ern—ing Board in fund-raising or similar-

efforts. Those interested are invited

%si2%Pitt News Re«views=s=e=:

by JOE ANDERSON

Morning rhythms cascading through a mu-
sical fog. Harsh slurred vocal in a farrago
of jazz variations. Elegiac tunes behind a
chimera of strife. Such is Tim Hardin and
such is his latest album TIM HARDIN 3 (FTS
-3049).

It’s.been almost a year since I last saw
and heard Tim Hardin. I’d almost forgotten
just what a powerful singer he is. His poise
andstature are so wistful; his music so self-
indulgent. The vocal work is involved and con-

‘vincing. It’s hard to listen to him without un-

dergoing some sort of emotional purgation. A
sonorous cleansing of all that ails. TIM HAR-

. DIN 3 is animation and the life feeling of Tim

Hardin.

The recording was made live at Tim’s
Town Hall Concert in April and contains
those added nuances that make a live gig that
much more stimulating over a studio session.
A recording_studio is just too impersonal and
stifling for a musician like Hardin. A live con-
cert offers the freedom that Tim needs to real-
ly get into his music. That Tim took full advan-
tage of this situation is plainly evident on.this
album. Songs like “You Upset the Grace of
Living When You Lie” lose much of that stu-
dio stagnation which can result in shoddy pro-
ductions, and in return pick up a more fecund
and spontaneous arrangement.

Hardin’s vocal is the model of simplicity
almost to the point of monotony. It has a very
sad, pained texture like a “God in pain” as

   

Tim Hardin: ‘God In Pain’

Keats would say. At times the vocal takes on
a self-indulgent esoteric quality as in “Misty
Roses”and “Lenny’s Tune.” It’s all so em-
tional in. a crude and unpolished sense. For
this reason in a song like “Smugglin’ Man,”
which is not really about Tim, the vocal is un-
wieldy and out of place. One feels that no mat-
ter how hard he tries Tim will never really
be able to get into this song. .
Athough definitely not a superjet vocal-
ist like Tim Buckley, Hardin nonetheless man-
ages to get variety into his songs through shift-
ing rhythmical patterns Catch expecially
“Lenny’s Tune” and “Don’t‘ Make Promis-
es.” Here the backup group provides author-
itative support without stealing the limelight.
The arrangements are jazz oriented and some
of the best are “Don’t Make Promises,”
“Smugglin,Man” and “Danville Dame.” But
with this type of situation (one singer, four
backup musicians) there is always the poten-
tial threat that the musicians will get carried
away and drown out the vocal. This ‘is what
happened a few months back when I saw a7
the play. The group was much too loud and it
was almost impossible to follow Tim. But on
this album everything works out all right and
the group retains its solidarity and function
as that of the back-up musicians.
“Danville Dame” comes across like a
herd of stampeding wilderbeasts. The musi-
cians run all over the place (especially the
vibes player) but they never quite catch up to

Hardin’s vocal which always manages to stay a
leap ahead. This piece and “Smugglin’ Man”
are the closest"Tim’s music comes to obsidian
rock which really isn’t close at all. My fa-
vorite cut is “If I Were a Carpenter.” Tim’s
vocal on this is just so tender and pleading
that it knocks me over every time I hear it.
The arrangement and lyrics so simple,
not a lot of this pretentious shit that ‘compos-
ers are trying to pass off of late. It’s (1 hope
the word won’t offend you) sincere. The same
thing happens to “Tribute to Hank Williams.”
Both songs were enough to send Town Hall
that evening for a loop as the applause would
suggest.

“This tune is dedicated and written for and
about Lenny Bruce” —~ That’s how Hardin in-
troduces “Lenny’s Tune.’.’ It is probably the
most meaningful tribute to Bruce that any-
one has yet offered. The song speaks of the
horrors surrounding Lenny’s drug hangup but
does so with a strong sense of sympathy and un-
derstanding. Tim sings “I lost a friend and I
don’t know why” and need it be said that we
all did. '

So that’s TIM HARDIN 3. For once in a
long time I’ve listened to an album without
coming away with a feeling of being duped by
some musicam mount or some quicksliver
guitarist. Tim’s music is without gimmicks
and eccentricity. It is not automatic or syn-'
thetic. It’s great and I guess that’s enough.

The chancellor has proposed a
computer information research?‘-
ing service which could be utili-

zed by universities, non-profit

organizations and industry. Users
could receive the information they
need at one location.

Dr./ Wes1eyW. Posvar, speak-

ing before a group of business-*

men, said that the cost and dif-

ficulty of information research.
has escalated to such a point that-..
often it is cheaper to take the’.
chance of repeating research than

to find whether it has been done

before. 3.

Dr. Posvar addressed the in}.
dustrialists to find if an effective
partnership could be developed,
between the university and in-,
dustry. “Pitt,” he said, “has be-
gun to establish a campus-based
information system. It would in-,
tegrate the information sourses
available to us. It could lead to-

the .onej-sgtop information service‘

that seems to urgently needed" by
both the industrial and academic;
communities.” *

“Pitt,” he went on, “is the
logical location for such a. ser-
vice because it has information,
processed and ready for exploi-

tation, it has the machinery for ’

processing other information‘ 
and the mechanisms to transmit‘
results to th e customers. 

“There are scholars available" 
to cﬁnduct fundamental research”:

and teachers to train students

during football _season. Cin-
drich was undefeated in, dual
meets last year as a freshman and
won two post season tourna-
ments. ’ P

“His ankle hasn't come around I

like _we hoped it would,” ex-
plained Adams. He could be one
of the best heavy weights in the
East and possibly the country.
Everything they’ve said about him
in football, well, he’s just as -good
if not better in wrestling.”

Despite the loss of team cap-'

tain Unangst _and Cindrich, the
matmen have several talented let-
termen returning plus a crop of
outstanding sophomore material.

Mark Payne, a 145-pound sopho-

more’, is described by~the coach

as having “as much potential as

' anyone I’ve ever coached. He has

natural ability, an awful lot of it.”

Last year as a freshman, Payne
a native of Sidney; N. Y., was
undefeated, won all three post-
season freshman toumies and was
named the outstanding wrestler in
the two meets which made such an
award. He was also the New
York state high school champion
and a member of the U. S. Jun-
ior world championship team.

Senior Larry Cuba and juniors
Jack Kuhn and Paul Allen head the
list ‘of returning lettermen who

will hold down starting assign-
ments. Kuhn and Allen will battle ‘

for the 177 pound spot before the
holidays..In next term’s meets,
one of the boys will move up to
191.

Cuba was a swing man last year
at 130, 137 and 145. He’s slated to
start at either 130 or 137 next
week. Another potential starter at
130 is junior Ken Case.

games.”

Panther followers can expect to
see a planned or patterned offense.
The Ridl philosophy, which worked
so well at Westminster, consists
of working for the higher percent-
age shot.

“But,” admits Ridl, “We’ll have
freedom of lattitude against some
defenses.”

Ridl ' is experimenting with a
starting lineup: He is looking for

 ‘the five boys that play the

best together.

“We played Stubenville in a
scrimmage Wednesday night,” ex-
plained Ridl, “and we were alter-
nating with ten or eleven players.
But I’d like to go with 7 or 8-;
nine at the most.”

. Against Steubenville, Ridl start-
ed Mike Patcher, Rob McFar-
land, Len Kalata, Mike Caldwell,
and Charlie Hunt. The cagers
won all three halves.

“In the firs“we blew them off the
court, but
Steubenville wasn’t particularly
good. They were strong under the
boards with a 6-9 and 6-6 boy,
but they were weak from the out-
side?’

Although the hoopsters won,
Ridl was not overly pleased. The
new mentor was concerned with
the failure of his Panthers to gell

mage. -

“If he gets out there with them
from the start he’ll do a great job,”
Banner stated. “It’1l be _the
toughest field that he’s ever run in.”
Thus far, Banner indicated that
Richey has been preparing for the
NCAA classic at the same pace that
he has run all season.

Banner indicated .that Kent St.’s.

est competitor during the regular

town, Dulong of Holy Cross,
Burkle of Villanova, the small
college champion from North Da-
kota; and all the champions from
the various conferences through-
out the United States will pro-

“Jerry will make every at-

in the pack. You can’t tell what
might-happen with over 350 run-
ners on the course,” Banner
explained. '

that he gets a fast start. If he
doesn’t get out of the pack, he

could have a rough time pas- I

sing 60 to 100 people,” said Ban-
ner.

Richey explained that he defini-
tely will run differently this
week. He remarked that he plans
to be with the leaders after the
first mile. Jerry commented, “I
don’t think that I'll get boxed in
again. I'm not going to make the
same mistake twice. I was too re-

He refused to predict that he‘

would beat out any of the three

distancemen who finished ahead of

him in the IC4A’s. “They’re all
good runners. We’ll have to wait
and see,” said Jerry.

“I do believe that I have a
good shot at finishing in the top

California track powers aren’t that

ed bad.”

“A lot of our players are about
the same in ability,” admitted
Ridl, “so we’ll probably use our
bench a lot; but we have to find
the five boys that work best to-
gether.”

Ridl also has _to experiment
with what he can do with what
he has. One problem that has

haunted the hoopsters during the "

last few years has been the lack

‘ of a big man.

“We would like the 6-10 and 6-
8 players who are quick like kang-
aroos,” said Ridl, “but we don’t
have that and so we have to work
with what we have.”

Ridl named Jerry Causer, a
junior transfer student from the
Johnstown regional campus, as
an added help under the boards.

“Jerry is going to be a big help,”
said Ridl. “He’s a new player, but
he has good strengths and good
power, and tremendous hustle. I
hope it gets to be contagious.”

The 6-5 center—forward who aver-
aged 21 points per game for John-
stown will be competing for front
line starting berths with Hunt,
Patcher, and sophomore Mike
Riggle. Guard Mike Caldwell will
do most of the ball-handling.

“The student body here is no
different than anywhere else.”
said Ridl, “If we show them good
basketball, they’ll be out here
hooping and hollering. I hope we
won’t disappoint them.”

Ridl’s “experiment” has worked
in the past.

On paper, the freshmen foot-

season. But the Cubs, who
finished with a 1-2 mark, might
have been a success in dis-
guise.

Many of the Cubs displayed a
football talent taht might very
well be used by the Panthers next
season. Coach Dave Hart has ex-
pressed interest in nine players in
particular. They are Bob Kuziel,
Dick Lozier, Dan Lynn, Lou Jul-
ian, John Moss, Larry Chesla, John
Simpson, Joe Carroll, and Jack
Dykes.

Most of. these frosh are line-

Once upon a time, as all fairy tales begin, there was a‘

clash between a boy named Jack and a Giant over a golden

goose. From there, everyone knows that with Jack’s courage -
and a couple of beans, he was able to conquer the Giant’

and return the golden goose to- the village.

The football program at this university ‘is now involved in a
Jack and the Giant type of struggle.

Our giant is Athletic Director Frank Carver. He sits high atop
Cardiac -Hill in his sheltered castle. Whereas the fairy tale’s giant
came down into the village at nay time_and fee-fie‘-foe whatever
he wanted, our giant remains calm and silent, safely situated in
his castle from 9 to 5. I

Head Coach Dave Hart plays the gallant Jack. He, too, has
courage. Week in and week out, he faces the press, the students,-
and the TV audience with only his enthusiasm and desire as his

weapons. A winning football team, and more important a‘ big-time_ 

football‘ program, are the golden goose aht he is trying to return

to the village of Oakland. So far, Jack seems to be fighting a los-

ing battle. . '

Ah, the beans, the magic beans. For Jack they provided a path-
way to the golden goose. The magic beans cost Jack a good deal
and he was criticized for their purchase, but in the end they
proved to be the right move. Jack’s small investment, though seem-
ingly big at the time, led to a more prosperous and better times for
all involved.

For Dave, the beans are beans. His beans seem to hold no ma-
gic. They seem to become fewer and fewer each year. Instead
of watering the beans and helping the beanstalk to successly grow,
Dave’s friends seem only interested in telling the same old stories
and leaving the beans to take care of themselves.

So, instead of leading to a new hopefullness, the beans~remain
stagnant, and seem only to be satisfied ‘in growing only once a

season and letting the rest of the year go by without so much as a’

fight.

Besides Dave, the villagers suffer right along with him. Each
week they go out to do battle with giants from other kingdoms and
come home defeated. There are grumbles that their own giant is
their worst enemy, but these are quickly silenced by the older

wise-men. Still, the villagers know that they should win and some- i I 

day they’re going to.

 

They also have some extras that make
shaving a lot easier. A
separate pop-up trim-
mer, snap-open clean-
ing, a handy on/off
switch, and a 110/220
voltage selector for
travel use.

Whichever you
choose, you can't get
a closer shave.

son as head soccer coach at Penn State. tomorrow.
when the Nittany Lions come here to face Leo
Bemis’ kickers at Carnegie-Mellon’s intramural
field. Schmidt will still be looking for his initial
truimph.

The State booters will take an 0-8 record into
the game, which also winds up the season for Bemis’
team. The booter coach, looking forward to the
match, remarked, “They will come down one of two
ways. Either after their first victory and to beat
Pitt, or.to see their undefeated football team play.’’

He added, “I don’t think it will be the sec-
ond way. though. They have.a good soccer team.
I don’t care about their record.

“The key man is Bill Snyder,” he continued. He’s
a good tough ball player; he scored three goals
against us last year. Arid, Dave Stock is quite good.
They kick long to him when they use the fast break,
and he assisted on two of Snyder’s goals last year.”

Bemis also, like most people, thinks that the poor
record of the Lions should be credited to their tough
schedule. Schmidt’s booters have lost to teams like
West Virginia, Maryland, Temple, and the service
academies, Army and Navy. All of these teams can
provide plenty of headaches for the average team.

So, the soccermen don’t expect an easy game,
but they do have some idea of what the results will
be. .

“They made up their minds quite awhile ago

I'd like your latest information on opportunities at

Du Pont for graduates with degrees in

that they could win the game. They want to win
in,” Bemis mentioned.

The team has wanted to win before. but hasn’t.
At least the kickers had no success prior to the last
two weeks.

“We’ve had shots. that would have made the dif-
ference in games, that missed.” Bemis commented.
“They could have started momentum. It helps to
score first or to be able to come from behind.”

“If we would have scored early in the first
game, it might have turned the whole season around.
he continued.

But, that didn’t happen, and the three seniors
who are on the team — Goalie Len Harmon, Full-
back Mike Schalk, and Lineman Norm Schulman —
will have to settle for a final season mark of 4
wins, 7 losses —— at best.

At one time it looked like they would be leav-
ing the squad after a winning season. Bemis gave
a possible explanation of why this didn’t occur, as
he said, “Maybe my psychology boomeranged a
bit. I kept telling them that they could win.

~ “But, the guys actually feel they’re as good as the
other teams,” the coach added.

Then, he thought of the slight comeback of the
last two weeks. “It shows you that you can get a
job done,” he reasoned. .

It was a job done that really changed the pic-
ture of an almost ‘‘lost’’ season; a season like the
one Schmidt’s Lions have had.

Herb Schmidt’s Winless State Squad Rif1e1‘sWin
Visits Bemis’ Booters in Final Game

The Pitt Varsity Rifle Team
remained undefeated last Friday
night as they won their third match
of the season beating Carnegie-
Mellon 1294-1278. Sophomore
shooter, Bill Crooks, paced the team
with a score of 266. Second for the
squad was Terry Osif with a score
of 264, while DickBirchbickler was
third with a score of 256. Tied for
fourth place were Frank O’Don—
nell and John Taucher with scores
of 254.

Sgt. Sarver stated that he was
pleased with the team’s win but
thought the score should have been
much higher, possible 1325. The
next match is at home against
Geneva on December 6. Sgt. Sar-
ver predicts another win and thinks
there is ' a good chance of
an undefeated season.

  Panthers Try to Unload Air Attack
“ Upon Strong Penn State Defenders

by ART ROSENGARTEN

The “Monster Machine” rum-
bles into Pitt Stadium tomor-
row afternoon wearing the blue
and white of Penn State. The
clash with the Panthers starts
with the kick-off at 1:30.

“They certainly are a monster
machine,” sighed head coach
 Dave Hart, “and they certainly
. can put it ‘to you both of-
, ‘ fensively and defensively. In fact,
’ * at one point in the season, their’
defense was outscoring their of-
fense.’ .

To say that Hart is impressed
. with the number three team in the
1 nation is an understatement.
A ”both the coaches and the lay-
 ers are tremendously impres-
 sediby the size, ability, and execu-
1 tion of the Penn State squad,” he
said.

Tow aspects of the Penn State
machine which particularly im-
pressed Hart were the Nittany
Lions halfbacks and their de-
_. fense. “They probably have the two

, most balanced halfbacks in the
‘~ country in Charlie Pittman and
Bob Campbell.”

A, “The most impressive thing
about the Penn State defense is
their ability to give the offense

One thing Hart plans to do,
weather permitting, is to throw
the bootball and throw it plen-
ty. “We’re definitely going to
throw the football, even fifty times
if we can,” he said. “And, we’re
gonna throw the ball to the best
weapon we’ve got, “Skip” Ors-
zulak.”

One of the problems with the
Pitt passing game of late has
been the inability of quarter-
back Dave Havern to deliver the
ball to his receivers. “Because of
the-weather the past two weeks,

join fullback Tony Esposito and,
number two‘ tailback Dave Gar-
nett in challenging State’s de-
fenders.

Tomorrow also marks the last
appearance in a Pitt uniform of the
remnants of the “Sweet l6,” the
seniors who were recruited in 1965
John Mich_elosen’s last year. Only

‘nine are left, and four will be.
starting tomorrow for their final
.time in Pitt Stadium.

“I’m deeply sorry that they

time this past season,” comment-
ed Hart. ‘

Hart also adds a word of warn-
ing to any State scouts, in that '
the Panthers will also do some tra-

- veling along the land route. Tail-.

ground gainer,» has recoverdd

Even though Hart realizes that

the _ Panthers are tremendous un- ‘
derdogs tomorrow, he feels that the
gridders have a chance ot come up

and come up with a tremendous
total team effort. This is the one
in which they’ll put all their eggs -
in ‘one basket,” he said.

defensive end Dave Montrella.
If linebacker Ed Gallin and of-
fensive tackle,‘ Greg Ellis can re-
cover from injuries sustained in the 3
Army game, they too will also
start. "

 

  

Orszulak, who is a possible All-
East candidate, still has a slim
chance of breaking a Panther re-
cord for the most passes caught
in one season. He needs 12 re-
c_eptions against the Lions’ to‘
' ‘break ‘Bob Long’s mark.
