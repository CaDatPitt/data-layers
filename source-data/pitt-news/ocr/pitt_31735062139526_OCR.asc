NBC ‘Sensation’
Brought Along
ForAnnual Ball

If the listeners of National Broad-
casting conipaiiy programs thought
enough of her to consider her a minor
sensation, she could at least please a
University audience, thinks the com-
mittee of the Intei'frateriiit.V hall.

And so Emerson Gill has been di-
rected to bring her along “without

the 18th of the month. '

She's a Cleveland debutante (says
the press release) and her name is
Marianii Mann. Gill, who runs an or-
chestra, “discovered her" as the tra-
ditional entertaininent world phrase
has it, and set her up as an attraction

on his twice daily VVTAM broadcasts.
Pre- and post—debutantes, besides the
with escorts
“1iailed" her at Cleveland's popular
Lotus Garden restaurant.

Interfrateriiity Ball tickets, marked
at $3.50 per couple, were placed on
sale Monday evening when the fra-
ternity boys gathered round the ﬁre-
side for their weekly meetings, Be-
tween handshakes and mumbles from
portions of the ritual, committee
members a.re credited‘with disposing
of an encouraging number of them.
Reservation tickets may be had for
$1.50,. the remaining $2 to be paid at
the door.

In the office of the dean of men,
with ‘Nilliaiii Daufenbach in Alumni

Political Institute
Changes System

Recommendation To Be Basis 
Fellowship Awards A

A new policy has been put into
effect by the National Institution of
Public Affairs in regard to their stu-
dent interneship plan -in government
instruction at Washington, by \V11lCh
the fellowships will be granted on the
basis of previous acliievenient and
recommendation by persons known ‘to
the Institution instead of by coin-
petitive examinations.

According to Dr, James C. Charles-
worth, assistant professor of political
science, under this plan the Institu-
tion will grant fewer fellowships than
its original publicity indicated

The purpose of this niovenient, spon-
sored by a group of private citizens, is
to give students practical experience
to supplement classroom study of po,-_
litical science. V

Program of study and training will
be under the direction of the Institu-
tion’s educationala director and a staff
of social science professors brought to
Vvashington from their respective col-
leges.

The qualiﬁcations which the candi-
dates must have include the follow-
ing: (1.) high scholastic standing;
(2) good health; (3) a deiiionstmted
interest in politics and government;
(4) qualities of c-.l.iai'a-zter and ability,
especially those concerned with
leadership.

About 40 University students have
sent in their applications. These stu-
dents should confer with some mem-
ber of the political science depart-
ment before (;Ol1llIlulll(:atlIl{_‘,‘ with the
Institution, Dr. Cliarleswortli said.

‘Flu’ Threatens
Campus, Warns

Health Service

An epidemic of inﬂuenza threatens
to spread through the University, ac-
G01‘di11s‘ 130 a warning issued by the
Student Health Service yesterday.

Already two women have been
taken to the hospital and a large
number of students have been sent
home. Unless preventive measures
are taken, the infection will spread,
said Dr. A. M. Jamison, of the
Women’s Health Service.

“The students can protect them-
selves and each other in several
ways,” Dr_ Jamison said.

“If students with severe colds will
stay at home, they can prevent to a
large extent the further spreading of
serious illnesses,” she advised.

“Cold germs are not in the air, as
many people believe. They are l'.l‘3.11S-
ferred from: one person to another by
physical contact through the handling
of papers, pencils, and books, and the
touching of doorknobs and desks.
Colds will decrease if students wash
their hands l.‘requeiitly and watch their
diets and rest periods. And above all,
if you know you have a cold, go
home.”

Joining Dr. Jamison in the warning
to students, Dr. H. C. Carlson, direc-
tor of the Men's Student Health Serv-
ice, snggests a list of hygienic meas-
ures which should help to prevent
contracting of colds, "ﬂu,” and possi-
bly pneumonia:

Rest at least 8 hours daily-—
avoid fatigue.

2. Illrinlc one to two quarts of
liquid daily.

3. Eat wholesome food at i'egu- i
lar intervals and just sulf-
cient to satisfy the appetite.

4. Reg'1ilai' elimination.

5. Keep entire body dry and
warm.

6. Bathe daily.

7. Get plenty of fresh air.

8. Moderate exercise out of
doors,

Students lvlio develop upper respi-

ratory infections should report. id

their i'ainily physician or to the Stu-
dent Health Service.

ner in the Hotel Schenley Monday
evening.

“There has been much confusion
on this subject,''’ he said. “Yet our
studies have incontrovertibly ‘shown

goods, both in entering and emerging
from depression."

Dr. Moulton, who received an LL. 1).

Harmony In Temporary CPSF
Justiﬁes Outlawed Group’s
Revival, Declares Wilkins

C P S F Acts Thursday

If the Council of Presidents of So-
cial Fraternities votes “aye" to the
recommendation:

If its membership is capable of
drawing up a constitution and set of
by—laws which would promise and in-
sure an organization dedicated to
high ideals of cooperation for the
best interests of the University and
student body;

If the Administration could be con-
vinced that the CPSF, in starting on
such a program, would be sincere in
its motives;

Then Interfraternity Council will
be reestablished on this campus.

The prospects look encouraging,
believe prominent CPSF members
and advisers.

Interfraternity Council was dis-
banded by order of the office of the
dean of men in May, after a squabble
over election of officers developed,
splitting the group into two political
factions between whom was much
had blood.

CPSF Temporary

’I‘o take its place. the CPSF was
formed this year, the body t.o be tem-

work in harmony for the good of
their council and the University, the

 

 

body was to be supplanted by the
original council.

Enrollm.ent in non-professional
graduate courses is ﬁfth largest in
the country. Only Ca1il'ornia, Chic go,
Colunibia, and Michigan have a great-
er enrollment in this division. Ac-
cording to Dr. VValters’ ﬁgures, which
he has compiled in a standard fashion
aiinually for four years, the Univer-
§sity’s total enrollment, not counting
‘extension, is greater than it was in
.1924 and the enrollment of full-time
students is greater than in 1929.

President Walters’ ﬁgures show
that college enrollments in the Middle
Atlantic states declined slightly this
;year, although there have been in-
;creases in all other sections of the
§<-ounti-y. In spite of the fact that;
flower enrollinents are the rule this
iyear in Pennsylvania and New York
‘states, the University enjoyed an in-
:crcase. Larger freshmen enrollments
‘arc the rule all over the country, and
itlie same tendency has been noted

Introducing Luke Swank, Who Records
Your Smiling Face For Posferity

 

Prints Of Cathedral, Mellon Institute, Panther Power House Mix
With Equestriennes, Clowns, Elephants, in Studio

 

By Leo Koeberlein

“There are men who somehow_ grip
your eyes and hold them fast like a
spell . .”

“And don't move—this Is the D_1C‘
ture,” says Luke Swank, UI11VeI‘S1i-Y
photographer, who takes the pictures
of campus groups along with a motley
variety of other things.

Mr, Swank’s position calls for pic-
tures and more pictures—-from one of
students lolling on the lawn of
Alumni hall with the Cathedral in the
background to one of the reCeDt101l
of the Polish ambassadoi'—to be iisccl
in "University pamphlets, in 'I.‘l1e.P1ti-
News, the Owl, and other Dllbl1Cal‘.lO11S_

The other day, in his studio on the
14th floor, Mr. Swank denied that he
has a favorite subject '50 l)h0t0g1'al)l1-

“I like circuses and old_ buildings,’
he admitted, “and steel mills because
pictures from.them are usually dra-
matic, but 1 hke~to ph_otosraDh any-
thing. I particularly like to work
around the campus because everyone
is considerate and helpful.

—are mixed with those of equestri-

Although he has never had a course
in photography, Mi‘. Swank’s works
have appeared in “Vogue,” “Fortune,"
“House and Garden,” the “New York

Two years ago, in New York, he made
his ﬁrst exhibition of prints. Recent-
ly he has had two one-man shows in
New York art galleries and one in
Newhope, near Philadelphia.

In commenting on the course in
photography which he will teach next
semester, Mr. Swank stated that, al-
though it will be experimental, it will
be practical, and not too much time
will be spent on technique,

Current Pittsburgh Business Review
Siimmarizcs County Housing Status

 

As a special feature, the current is-;
sue of the “Pittsburgh Business Re-E
view,” monthly publication of the
Bureau of Business Research, con-3
taius “A summary of housing in Alle-I
gheny county” by J_ P. ‘Watson, 35‘
sistant director of the Bureau.

According to the sunimary. there
were 228,076 residential structures re-
ported, ranging in character from
mansions to shacks. Of these 1,975
were grouped as hotels, clubs, etc.,
leaving a net of 226,101 pure residen-
tial structures.

A typical ﬁve-room house or apart-
ment, it was found, contains a living
room, a kitchen, a dining room, and
two bedrooms. Such a dwelling,
housing a. family of ﬁve, means an av-
erage of one DGFSOD per TOOIII.

Vacancies varied in different sec-
tions in the county, as well as be-

tween different wards of the city.

The range in Plttsburgli alone varied
from 2.7 in the 31st ward to 2-1.0 in
the third ward.

Tenant occupants were reported in
56.5 per cent of the family units. Of
the 43.5 per cent of owner occupants
nearly 55 per cent reported that the‘-.ir
homes were mortgaged to some ex-
tent.

Statistics on facilities and equipment
also were revealed. 111 82 511 units.
neither a bath ‘tub, nor a shower was
repor-‘.ed. Complete lack of runnin:_:;
wa.ter«was found in 16.000’ dwellings,
and nearly 72,000 had only cold run-
ning water. The lack of such facili-
ties was relatively greater outside of
Pittsburgh than within the city.

The larger part of the family units
use gas for cooking and electricity
for lighting. Central furnace typo
heating equipment and heating stoves
were reported in 173.000 and in 130,-
604 family units respectively_

,3ciem‘i3t’s Utopia
Only WV 1' n dy
I d yl I

 

By Herrymon Maurer

AT FIRST THE OPENING meeting of the convention

of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science appeared to be no place for a columnist.
Only a caricaturist could have been at home. But at
the ﬁrst words of the welcome addresses, it was clear
ﬁlial; there were possibilities for genuine mental stimula-
ion.

I learned in the opening welcomes that science offers
hope of progress. Reassuring to one who feels that pos-
sibly the present era is cliaracterized by decay, I pre-
pared to suffer a change of mind. Science, we were
told, is a. cu1'e._for panaceas and a prevention of war, I
had always felt that Science ma.de war more (levstructive,
but the facts were clearly against me_ There 53 great
liope—the outward boundaries of Science are being
pushed far out. This was a great disclosure, and I

A leaned forward oxpectantly.

Episcopal Sanction And Science

The speaker of the evening, who was introduced with
episcopal sanction, was an eminent psychiatrist, who do-
livered, I must quite sincerely point out, an excellent
address in the Scientiﬁc Manner. The speaker coin-
mented on nia1i’s forward movement into the realnis of
Knowledge. He properly oriented the audience by
straightway employing such cool laboratory words as
organism. instead of man, and cosmos, instead of uni-
verse. We were assured that _we were much better off
than our ancestors in the last century, who had the
primitive conception that man is made up of cells, {is-
sues, and organs. VVe have found the key to the under-
standing of man the key of the twilight zone, the rub-
conscious.
really is.

The audience leaned forward expectantly and an aged,
bald-headed man in the front row cupped his car to hear
the ‘better. The news deserved attention since the un-
derstanding of man has always been somewhat difficult.

For one thing, Science demonstrates the kinship of
man. "It shows that we really are all tlie-same.-. I.-felt
plea.sa.iit1.y happy at these words and looked forward to
a. new amity between European nations and good-feeling
towards the Australian bushman. I reﬂected that a
French writer, Romain Rolland, had once said the same
thing; but he was a. literary man and was only engaging
in fancy, while this man dealt with fact.

The speaker was now coming to the main point of the
lecture; he said that there exist reciprocal actions of
the world within the Mind and the universe without.
Tolstoy once, I remembered, had attacked this idea as a
wisli—fulﬁllment on the part of the scientist, but I am not
one to compare Tolstoy, whose knowledge came from ob-
servation of people in action, to  scientist, whose knowl-
edge comes frbm observation of people in a laboratory.
We were assured that there is an absolute analogy be-
tween the Mind and the body. The Mind has evolved
just as the body has evolved, and it bears the ‘imprint
both of the struggle of the organisni with the universe,
and of the civilization which it has created. For in-
stance, children, whose minds are growiiig in stature,
are like primitive man, not like civilized men.

Mosaic Origin Of Man, False

Furthermore, man expresses the laws of the cosmos.
He is a part of it, not added to it in a. Mosaic sense.
This seemed to be an open question. I awaited the ox-
planation, but the proof was not yet forthcoming. The
lecturer pointed out that everything psychic is governed
by the laws of the psychic, although there is some aun-
culty in discovering those laws. I felt this to be :2 great
pity, but was reassured by the tone of the speaker's
voice, which seemed to imply that success was certain.
Vi-‘e learned next that man——man in his individual not
generic sense——was the nieasure of all things, and that
why a man follows a certain occupation is to be ex-
plained with reference to his Mind.

At this time a man in the second row of chairs on the
stage began to goto sleep and I felt that such an action
was a bad thing, inasmuch as real Knowledge was being
presented. I did not neglect my own culiglitenment to
pity others. I reasoned that the man must have had :1
hard day and was in need of sleep and might not have
understood even if he had stayed awake and llSl.el1€‘(l
carefully. But here was proof: at times of earthquakes
and like external calami-ties the mind also becomes dis-
turbed. Furthermore, when the mind becomes disturbed,
it sees destruction and disintegration about it.

I felt at once that external calamities are, flft€‘l' all,
comparatively rare events and do not cover all the ac-
tivities of the universe. Besides, the speaker was only
saying that insanity is equal to insanity, in fact, only
deﬁning that disorder. I awaited further proof. Furtlier
proof was not forthcoming, and the speaker went on to
say that since scientists were able to change the sex of
pigeons we could be happy. I Wondered how’ the chang-
ing of the sex of pigeons had anything to do with the
changing of the nature of the Mind, but did not let my
mind dwell on this, since I wished to consider ‘the proof
of the universe-organism idea.

Tiddledywinks

Then suddenly I felt that I had been misled and that
I had heard not fact but only an expression of opinion
of the basic philosophy according to which men of Sci-
ence work. I remenibered that the basic proposition of
Science is that whatever is necessary to scientific
thouglit——tliis to be determined by the scientists~—i'eall_v
exists. In my ignorance, I saw no more real ‘reason to
accept this proposition than my own proposition, that
whatever is necessary to nia.ke tiddledywink playing on-
joyable really exists (for I am fond of 'LldfllGyWlI1l(S).

Heredity and environment were the next theme. I
noticed with a new sympathy that the man in the recond
row was going to sleep again. I myself have :1 realistic
turn of mind and am a.nnoyc_'l by spectacular ﬂights of
fancy sucli as those in which the speaker was indulging,
and I thought to take leave. But I considered that it
would be impolite to run away and so remained to hear
that heredity and environment are really one; :-"or the
inherited ability to pla.y the violin, for instance, is of no
use without the violin. The necessity of violins ‘ifor
music seemed probable, but I questioned the zimportancc
ascrilied to heredity.

By this ‘time the speaker was coming to on oratoriro.l
ﬁnish, although he professed a distrust of the bewitc-hing
in1’luence of words. Vvlien the ego-centric urjvorse was
destroyed, man increasecl his knowledge. Vvhcn evolu-
tion appeared, man learned he could not consider him-
self dominant among the animals; again he had to in-
crease his knowledge. (The trouble was, it appear;-1, that
the old thinkers had created the universe in the shape
of their own minds——-being in Science the couiiterparts
of antliropomorpliists in 1*eligi'on——a1id that the new sci-
entists, liowcver nucli they might spool: of the unity of
mind and universe, were singularly free from this de-
feet.)

Intellectual Depression

Now with the help of psychology man is able to go
forth and conquer reality by knowledge, get rid of ani-
mislic mechanisms. which are like old fossils, and go
forth to the great opportunities .".llf—‘,:lCl.

The speech ended. and I made my way home in a de-
pressed state of mind, which sometimes happens when I
have not received the expected beneﬁts from 14.11 educa-
tional discussion. I remembered somebo(ly's opinion
that Science represents the modern phase of the worst
of the medieval mind. I remembered too Dean Swil:":’s
description of the scientists of Laputa as men who ﬂy
about in the sky without any concern for realities. I
iried to dismiss such heretical notions from my mind,
but with little success. At home I found a visitor. a
friend of the family who had suffered :1 recent bereave-
ment, and I tried to apply to her condition notions of :1
cosmos—c-onditioned organism, but succeeded not at all,
and went to bed unhappy.

Forces Of Social Conflict k
Shown In ‘We Live Again"

By Edwin P. Banks
(6 E LIVE AGAIN.”

My mind is confused with so many impressions
as I sit here at home trying to pluuk out a column on
Anna. Sten‘s latest picture, that what I write will prob-
ably turn out to be a. hopeless muddle. But I do want to
write about. the ﬁlm, and I want to write about it now
while the spirit of it is still in me.

MGM's interpretation of Tolstoy's immortal novel
is not a very great movie; yet I think it says the
great thing that the Russian’s book expressed. It
proclaims the thesis of Jesus, Spinoza, and Marx—-
as John Middleton Murry so well brought out at the
YMHA last Friday—that men are brothers after all,
no matter how different they may be individually.
It is the thesis of the Declaration of Independence
almost forgotten in the Constitution.

Shakespeare uttered it through the agonized voice of
Shylock: “Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands,
organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passion? . . .”
It is what the Abolitionists slioutedwhen they agitate
for freeing the negro slave. The Bolsheviks said the
We
are trying to make it understood in America today for
the laborer and the farmer.

I do not believe that one is being sentimental when he
feels deeply his kinship with other human beings.
Much to the contrary, he has experienced an emotion
which can make him and the rest of the world a. great
deal happier. And I do not believe that happiness is
necessarily an illusion. It is. an illusion only to those
who are too cowardly to take the chance of gaining it.

A man who has matured to the conviction of the
brotherhood of man should give his contribution to-
ward making the thesis a political, social and eco-
nomic actuality. There ought to"be a Hell paved
with good intentions. ‘Not that he should be a fool,
not that he should waste his gifts with reckless zeal,
not that he should shed the blood of his fellows or
his own needlessly. But he should act intelligently
for the realization of 'his i-deal. If he does not, he
has buried his talent of silver.

A-s forewarning you, my mental confusion is already
apparent, and I seem to have wandered far from my sub-
ject. I have been preaching in the spirit of “We Live
Again,” though. The picture resurrected old Russia; it
re.vea.Ledu.tlie appalling times when the peasant classwas
treated by the aristocracy as species of beast somewhat
better than dog. The story related the life of a prince
who felt the brotherhood of man, but who stiﬂed that
spirit for a. while. He almost wrecked the life of a
peasant girl because he made himself forget that she
had a. human soul. But later the spirit lived again in
him, and he did attempt to carry out the good intention
of his youth.

“We Live Again” is disseminating this subtle propa-
ganda from billion dollar Hollywood: every man and
woman is a human being like yourself, you who have;
every man and woman waiits food, security, opportunity,
affection just as you want them; you should not neces-
sarily give 11p what you have to others, but you should
work to help them get more of what you had the luck
to get yourself. Fortunately, the censors have not sup-
pressed this propaganda as immoral or un-Anierican.
Probably most of them were conﬁdently skeptical of the
average movie-goers perception.

Among those in the United States today, who think
that they think, are good Catholics, Jews, and Protest-
ants; good Republicans, Democrats, Socialists, and Com-
munists. They are sincerely devoted to the cause of
their group or groups but primarily they believe tlieir
creed offers the best program for the happiness of the
world. The common premise on which they all base
their opinions and actions is the brotlierliood of man.

I am still optimistic enough to feel that with this
premise. those indivi»dua1s——appea.ring under different
classiﬁcations as the world changes—will yet come pretty
close to a solution of the problem of man's inhumanity
to man. Let us all hope so.

The music had stopped; with a merry tat-tat,

They returned to their l;--3-otli, these four.

They whispered and jabbered of this thing, and that, .
And acted as sweethearts; no more.

The girls, aghast, tossed their heads and their hands,

President’ 3 Talk
Reveals Program

Ofsocial Reform

By David W. Fagan

Amid great acclamation, the Presi-
dent related to Congress his program
consisting of a national plan inculcat-
ing greater social justice and social
security. The critics were thwarted
with his declaration that “An attempt
to make a distinction between recov-
ery and reform is a. narrowly-cou-
ceived effort to substitute the appear-
ance of reality for reality itself.”

The Chief Executive interpreted the
depression as a. disease of which dis-
parity of prices, limitations of farm
and factory products, prevalence of
low incomes and unemployment are
the symptoms. The President said:
“When a man is convalescing from an
illness, wisdom dictates not only cure
of the symptoms, but also removal of
their cause.” . . .

On this basis appears the Presi-
denl:’s justiﬁcation of a program of
reform through which a lasting recov-
ery may be enhanced. The economic
sterility of the plan appears in the
long term possibilities of numerous
reforms and policies that would be
articulated under the conceivable new
order-—naniely the administration's
far reaching wage and labor policies——
have been set aside from the larger
program and adopted permanently
with the intuition that they are an im-
pediinent; to recovery_

The message, however, may be
11-oiled as one of his most outstanding,
coupled with the fact of its being
given_ under the realities of the de-
pression.

Idealism of a three-way national
program,-.na.me1y, security of liveli-
hood, security against the major
hazards of life and security of decent
homes, is repeated throughout the dis-
course. But it also faces the basic
facts of continued great unemploy-
ment and the irresponsibility of in-
tanga-ble relief ' roles.

Signiﬁcance of the public works
plans is that they must be, as far as
possible, useful projects, non-competi-
tive with private industry, and must
carry inducements for the workers
larger than the amount now received
as a relief dole, but at the same time
not as large as to encourage the rejec-
tion of opportunities for private em-
ployment_

This is indeed a constructive pur-
pose. The great problem of meeting
the cost will now. be faced, -since we
shall hear less to the effect that work
relief must carry suﬁicient pay to
maintain the American
living,

Soundly synthesizing, the time is
ripe that we should withdraw from
the realms of astronomy and return
to Mother Earth with the subsequent
realization of a ﬁrm footing. Many
had thought that after the tooth had
been pulled and pain had subsided,
the outlook would change as a matter
of course. Of late we have learned
that 90 .per cent agitation and only 10
per cent forward looking action will
not bring about those constructive
elements necessary for our economic
salvation.

The Mail

Editor's note: In an editorial
printed Monday The Pitt News
identified the League for Social
Justice in a manner “sadly incor-
rect,” according to a consensus
which began to accumulate on the
editor's desk early Monday. The
following excerpts represent the
claims of the revisionists. The
News still believes thata campus
branch of the League should be
chartered at once.

Editor, The Pitt News:

The following identification con-
tains at least three statements that
are untrue: “. . the League for So-
cial Justice national society
which investigates
and which has helped to obtain rein-
edial social legislation in Pennsylva-
nia and other states."

The League for Social Justice is a
local civic organiation. It is not en-
gaged to any marked extent in the
field for social legislation, since its
genius is not in that ﬁeld; its interest
in the subject is real. but its activity
in that ﬁeld rather incidental. The
League has no function outside its
own community, i. 9., municipality,
state and nation in the order named;
it has never exercise-:l any inﬂuence
(or sought to do so) in any other
state, and its work in Pennsylvania
has been conﬁned to Pittsburgli and
Allegheny County and to the passing
of resolutions on matters of state and
national importance.

— K_ D.
Editor. The Pitt News:

I wish to clarify some disconcerting
opinions arising out of a news story
appearing in The Pittsburgh Press
January 3.

The League for Social Justice has
not as yet presented a. petition for
>"€3.l.‘.O§-.“lllt‘i0ll as a campus activity.
When I was asked for my opinion of
this group, I refused it on the grounds
that as a iiienibcr of tlio Organizations
comiuittce 1 would ﬁrst 11:-ivc to evalu-
ate its worth on the basis of facts pre-
sentcd.

The more controversial sections of
the article dealt with the relative
powers of the Executive committee
Z‘.-,l.1d sub-cominittees. I recently pro-
posed to the Univexsity Assembly that
the Oi'ganizatioiis committee be grant-
ed the power to review all applicant
groups. and to report only to the As-
sembly. This motion was overwhelmi-
ingly (left-af.e(l. I was completely sat-
isﬁed thal: my proposal had received 3.
fair hc:u'ir.-g. although I still feel
strongly that the present. set—up is
not all that miglit be desired.

The 1‘cpoi'f,er’s references to “pick-
ling conmiiticcs,” “brake on liberal
activities,” etc., were completely ﬁc-
titious so far as I am concerned, To
date there is no basis in fact for such
iiiiplications. That the present set-up
might have certain restraining inﬂu-
ences on student thought and action
is merely one opinion, and is one for
which I will take either credit or
blame at this time.

Bucknell Game Cancelled;
Pitt Prepares For Temple

 

Bison Oﬁicials Fail To Obtain Floor For Friday Night;
Panthers Meet Owls At Philadelphia Saturday

By William K. Trosen
Temporarily shoving aside the worries of the present city title
scramble that came from the torrid battles with Tech a.nd Duquesne,
the Panther basketball team moves East tomorrow night intent on
increasing its lead in the Intercollegiate league when the Pitt cagers

 

met the team that is perhaps their-9

strongest conference rival, the Owls
of Temple university, in Philadelphia
on Saturday night.

Originally the Panthers had another
cage game on the schedule for the
short Eastern tour, but Bucknell ath-
letic officials yesterday cancelled the
engagement the Pitt ﬁve was to keep
there. Failure to procure an avail-
able ﬁoor for Friday night was the
reason given for the cancellation.

Dr. Carlson and his men will likely
not do any brooding over the shift in
plans, inasmuch as the players will
be in a much more fresh condition to
go against the Owls, whose team is
reported to be the best in years.

Temple ls Tough

As yet, the Philadelphians have not
taken part in any of their lnter-col-
legiate games, but if comparative
scores mean anything Temple has a.
ball club that can rate with the best
of them. During the past week the
Owls whipped Drake university slight-
ly worse than the Dukes did when
Drake -visited here recently, and it
takes no memory expert to remember
that the Dukes were good enough last
Friday to nose out Pitt’s Golden Cats.

At present the Panthers and the
Mountaineers share the lead in the
Inter-collegiate Conference league,
each with one victory and no defeats;

In a checkup on the leading individ-
ual scorers of the conference, Har-
gaden of Georgetown is found to show
the way with a total of 29 points,
Loucks of Pitt is second with 18
points, Shomo of Tech has ripped the
cords for 15 points, with Monahan of
Bucknell taking fourth place with 14
points. All of these players have
taken part in two conference games
with the exception of Loucks who has
only played in one conference game
thus far. '

The leading individual scorers of
the three city teams ﬁnd two Du-
quesne players heading the ﬁeld.
Birch leads with 62 points, followed
closely by Serany with 54 points. The
next three high point men all hail
from the Panther team, the three be-
ing Cribbs with 51 points, {Hughes
with only two points less, and Emrick
boasting 46 points.

The present standing of the East-
ern Inter-Collegiate league:

Old Council May
Replace CPSF

group's method up to now, and be-
lieve that its membership-—expanded
to include junior representatives in-
stead of only presidents of fraterni-
tles——could work successfully as an
Interfraternity Council.”

When asked whether he thought
such a council would operate without
the bickerings, factionalism and spoil-
isin which led to the demise of the
old council, he replied: “I sincerely
hope so, and really believe so.”

Dr. Lanfear touched a new note.

"-Do 1 think that as an Interfrater-
nity Council this group would drop
the nonsense that caused the preced-
ing organizal:ion’s downfall? VVell, it
that nonsense were to continue, 1
think those boys know what would
happen!

“But I think they'll be all right.

“Personally, I’m concerned with
the good of all the students in the
University, and if this group is organ-
ized to work that way, I’m for it. I
think it is.”

McClain Advocates Plan

Perhaps the most active in the on-
position group in Interfraternity
Council last year, when the faction
to which Wilkin’s fraternity was then
allied was forced out of office before
the council was disbanded, Clifton
McClain, C35, Sigma Chi, made the
in regard to
CPSF and the proposed new council:

“CPSF apparently has been work-
ing for the good of all fraternities
this year. I am in favor of organiz-
ing lnte:'*fraternity Council again to
draw into its membership junior rep-
resentatives of fraternities. In this
way, the underclassmen will be better
qualiﬁed to carry on the Work next
year.”

immediately before last May's
lu'oak-up, Robert Vvillison, BA35, Del-
ta Tau Delta, had been named Council
president. A rival faction unseatetl
‘.'\'illison and elected McClain as the
organization was outlawed. McClain
is now social chairman of OPSF.

 

Cigarettes!
Speaking of distinction. Herbie
Rackoﬁ", C38, Connellsvi1le’s contri-

bution to The Pitt News, is among the
few students known to have been
tossed out of the PAA hut across the
street.

In answer to the polite “Yes sir,”
of an attendant, Rackoff inquired,
“Could I buy some cigarettes for
some Pitt Newsers?”

Rackoff was shown the door to the
accompaniment of “This is a private
club.”

Members of The News smoked their
pipes.

Swimmers Drill
For Two Meets

Coach Corr Carefully Grooming
Breaststroke Candidates

 

For the past three practice sessions
Pat Corr-has been grooming the var-
sity swimming team for its two dual
meets with Franklin and Marshall and
Delaware on Friday and Saturday
nights, respectively. The Panthers
will swim both meets away from
home.

Corr is devoting practically all of
his time with the tentative entrants
for the 200—yard breaststroke event.
during the last few days of practice
before the two coming meets. As it
stands now, the comparative time, of
William Swazuk and John Stiranka
indicate that they are likely to be the
starters in the breaststroke race.
Neither man has had any competitive
experience swimming breaststroke.
Both were former backstrokers_ Sti-
ranka was the Pittsburgh Interschol-
astic champion in 1932 and Swazuk
has held down a varsity backstroke
position for two seasons. ~ --

Coach Corr is unable as yet to
name his entrants for all the events,
owing to the close competition among
the freestyle swimmers. Candidates
for the 50-yard f_reestyle event include
Harry Geyer, Joe Madden, Williani
Lewis, and Paul Stinner. Possible
men for the 100-yard freestyle event
are Russell Lindberg, Captain Jack
Denny, and two of the 50-ya.rd eu-
trants, Lewis and Geyer. Denny,
Lindberg, Joe Jones and William
Swazuk seem slated to handle the
longer events, the 220 and 440-yard
freestyle events.

‘Two selections for the 400-yard re-
lay event are Lindberg and Denny,
two ‘of thefastest freestyle men on
the squad. The other two members
will be the 100-yard freestyle entrants.

At present Harry Geyer and George
-Meyer have the inside track on the
diving event. Neither diver ha.s had
any varsity experience, both coming
up for their ﬁrst taste of varsity com-
petition this season.

John Hart, 155 pounds—Hart is

that he boxes because he loves the

Coach Olson Conducts Tryouts
For Posts On Relay Teams

After spending most of the time
before the holidays getting into con-
dition, the candidates for the indoor
track team have begun heavier work-
outs to get in shape for the ﬁrst meet
of the year early in February.

At the present time, Coach Olson
is concerned mostly with the relay
teams. In the ﬁrst tryout for places
on the mile-relay outﬁt, Groat, letter-
man from last season's track team,
led the ﬁeld of tryouts. The three
members of last season’s champion-
ship mile-rela.y team, Kiger, Connelly,
and McDonald, followed Groat in re-
spect to the speed shown in this ﬁrst
run. McMunn, Leggin, and Tost, al-
though trailing the runners mention-
ed above, are still to be reckoned
with for places on the mile-relay
team.

In the two and four-mile relay
events, Coach Olson is well supplied
with good distance men. Kirkpat-
rick, Vvagenhouser, Tost, Musico, and
Albright, all cross-country letter-
men, comprise the material upon
which Olson will rely for the distance
events. Continuing the form shown
in the hill-and-dale sport this past
season, Kirkpatrick is leading the
list of tryouts for these longer events.

Bonavita, holder of the University
indoor track shot-‘put record, and Avi-
zienis, star performer for the frosh
last year, are engaged in a give-and-
take duel for leading honors in the
shot event. Sometimes Blonavita
heaves the iron ball the farthest dis-
tance, and on just as many other oc-
casions the sophomore star gets the
‘best throw. ,'

While not receiving as much atten-
tion from the coach as have the relay
men, the pole vaulters, hurdlers, and
broad jumpers are hard at work. Pe-
lucha, Johnson, and Blair in the pole-
vault; Lasky, Good, and Sowiski in
the hurdles; and Fleming and Good
in the broad jump are the leading
candidates in these three ‘events.

A general call for varsity and fresh-
man candidates has been issued, and
all those responding to the invitation
will report to Manager Marshall
Baker at the track house any after-
noon during the week.

Masques and Mimics,” freshman
acting unit, is presenting a one-act
play entitled “Pirates,” by Colin
Campbell Clements, at the senior 1nen-
for tea this afternoon at Heinz House.
The tea, at 3:30 o’clock, is being given
by the social unit (1).

Dr. Dorothy Torreyson, instructor
in modern languages, will pour tea for
the affa.ir. Eleanor Scanlon, C, chair-
man of the social unit (1), will make
the Welcoming speech.

Under the direction of Virginia
Sepp, C35, the cast of “Pirates” in-
cludes Geraldine Stewart, Sally Pat-
terson, Janet Hallock, Zelda Gut-
macher, Ruth Trapht, Sally Digby,
and Irene Maroney. Committee chair-
men are: Louise Baughman, setting;
Excie Laird, costumes; Blanche

thal, prompter.

The Scribblers, freshman literary
unit, held their last meeting at the
home of Martha Fuller, chairman, on
Sunday afternoon. Judy Rohrer, read
a satire entitled “Six People;” Anna
Mae Thoma read an unusual descrip-
tion of a beer garden; Maxine Hirsh,
C35, adviser to the unit, read a num-
ber of original poems; and Miss Ful-
ler read three different interpreta-
tions of, and moods towards, the same.
subject, Miss Fuller used for her
readings “The Farm” and “Granddad
Died Yesterday."

The literary group decided to hold
the remainder of the year’s meetings
in Alumni hall after each member of
the unit has entertained the other
members once. It was also suggested
that each member keep a journal of
her personal everyday experiences.
The next meeting will be held Sunday
afternoon, February 10, at the Kappa.
Alpha Theta house, when Miss Rohrer
will be hostess. ’

Group Discusses
Student Health

American Association Finds High
Percentage Of Tuberculosis

The high percentage of tuberculosis
among college students was one of the
highlights of discussion at the 15th
annual meeting of the American Stu-
dent Health Association which Dr.
Auleene Marley Jamison, director of
Student Health service for women, at-
tended as a representative of the Uni-
versity.

Because of this high percentage, the
associatiion has made plans: for :1
wide dissemination of information con-
cerning the causes and the preven-
tion of tuberculosis, at the same time
stressing the fact that the disease can
be'cured. ,

Dr. Jamison reports, “The new
tuberculin tests are more certain than
former ones. Puriﬁed protein de-
rivative in tuberculin testing is prov-
ing very satisfactory and the associa-
tion is eager to use it more exten-
sively in the routine physical examina-
tions of college students.”

In conjunction with the association
progi-a1.n Dr. Jamison said, “Here at
the University we are planning to
make this new tuberculin test availa-
ble to any women students desiring
it.”

Beginning her 1935 lecture schedule,
Dr. Jamison addressed the Crafton
Junior club yesterday evening on
“Healthful Living.” ‘

Playclothes Dominate Wardrobe A
As Fashion Reporter Tums South

A new year, new styles, and theimageuta, sapphire, and bright green

Fashion Reporter,

semi-monthly , (the Regency shades), or the orange,

pamphlet published by the Researchipeacock, mahogany, and wine colors

Bureau for Retail Training, devotes
its newest issue to "playtime clothes.”

s

Even if you are not contemplating?

a mid-winter vacation AYVOL, or a

cruise south for your health, you will,

be wearing the new styles in several"

months, and now is the time to get
them when they are still new and in-
dividual, the Fashion Reporter ad-
vises.

The new three—piece play suits have
skirts that button up the side. wrap
around, zip on, or “just tie at the top
like the skirts worn by natives of
tropical isles.” ‘Colors are more
gaudy than ever, with emphasis on
the Mexican and peasant schemes.
Buttons have gone native, too
cork, rafﬁa, and shell are coming up.
For bicycling, north or south, the
divided skirt is regaining its popu-
larity with those who have an aver-
sion to shorts.

Of bathing suits, the style sheet
says “Never have we seen so much
style in so little area_ They are really
like little dresses with high-ﬁtted
waistlines and interesting necklines.”
The new suits come in waffle, diag-
onal, or knobby knit, and in all color
combinations.

In the fabric line, linens lead in in-
terest, but launder more easily and
come in more varied weaves this
year. -Cotton crash and cotton
chenille, inexpensive sport silks, and
lightweight woolens vie for attention
on cruises or at the better resorts,
with laces and homespuns from the
synthetic group giving a novel effect.
White, pastels, natural and beige (the
conservative colors), are still good,

of the peasant styles. All-sized
stripes, checks, plaids, polka dots, and
prints form the galaxy of patterns
from which to choose your resort
clothes.

For warm climates it is essential to
look cool and crisp; therefore, lines
must be simple, with no extra frills.
The shirtwaist, as well as last sea-
son’s tunic, is still good in a resort
wardrobe. Little jackets are import-
ant, and very smart in contrasting
colors_ Interesting details of the new
dresses are the attractive treatments
of shirring, smocking, and tucking, or
the monograms embroidered on the
pocket, sleeve, or front of the dress,"
the Fashion Reporter says.

According to the style sheet, even-
ing clothes are to be selected for per-
sonal taste: for the picturesque type,
there are the robes-de-style; for the
sophisticated, “the stream-lined gowns,
slits and all.” “Above all,” it says,
“watch for the shorter-in-front hem-
line!”

Among the coats and suits are to be
found separate skirts, jackets, and
blouses, and woolen coats with swag-
ger lines. It is smart to contrast, col-
ors in suit ensembles as well as play-
suits, the booklet suggests, The new
sweaters boast horizontal stripes, and
the skirts are equipped with new slits,
pockets, and fastenings.

“In hats lies the key to individu-
ality. Styles range from demure lit-
tle bonnets to dramatic large brims;
crowns are high or low, and brims
ﬂattering; trimmings vary from mad
little bunches of ﬁeld ﬂowers or feath-
ers to gay bands of Mexican colored

 

but for variety they can be supplanted yarn. or dark contrasting ribbon
with a grayish “horizon blue," bands.”
