struggle
with

Steelers’  

loss  

Liz, Keeney
Stajf Writer

When quarterback Ben Roethlis-
berger threw his ﬁnal incomplete
pass last night and sealed the Pack-
ers’ 31-25 victory over the Steelers,
it wasn’t just the hopes of several
dozen teammates that died — the
hopes of the Steel City residents
died too. ' V

Thousands of fans watchedas
their team lost the “biggest game
of the year. Thousands more cel-
ebrated as the Green Bay Packers
took home their ﬁrst Super Bowl
win in more than a decade. For
many fans", this annual match-up
is more than a game of numbers —

. some viewers tie their happiness

to the outcome.

Aimee Kimball, the director of
mental training for UPMC Sports
Medicine, said there is something
more to the psychology of fandom
than the excitement over a win or
loss. ' P ~ .

The Pitt doctor, who often
works with athletes to improve
their mental performance, said
that generally there are two differ-

‘ ent types of fans — those who view
sports as a social activity and are

less likely to be affected by their 4

team’s performance, and the truly
die—hard fans. S

A loss might be harder on die- 9

hard fans than on those who view
sports as a social activity. By put-
ting their emotions in the hands

Chick-fil-Al controversy reaches Pitt’s campus -

Emily Riley
Staﬁ”Wri ter

Chick-fil-A might experience adecrease

in business from Pitt students after the

national fast food chain was linke_d with
groups opposing same—sex marriage,
but the administration will not take any
action against the company,

In January, the fast food chain was
linked to Focus on the Family, the
National Organization for Marriage,
the Pennsylvania Family Institute and
several other organizations that dis-
courage same—sex marriage. The fast
food chain has seen protests at other

universities in the country, i~nclu~ding~

NYU, University of New Orleans and
Texas Tech University. Indiana Univer-
sity South Bend even placed a briefban
on the company’s products.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele.said that
Pitt has requirements of the compa-
nies it contracts with, and the contract
that Chick—fil-A has with Sodexo ful-

. ﬁlls those requirements, making action

against the company unnecessary.

“The University of Pittsburgh is com-
mitted to conducting its business in an
ethical, legal and socially responsible
manner,” he said.

“Sodexo has stated that‘ it sets high
standards for its brand partners and
suppliers and Chick—fil-A meets or ex-
ceeds those requirements, including

' quality standards, foo_d safety and pro-
curement practices and operating in a '

responsible mariner,” Fedele said.

Pitt’s Rainbow Alliance has spoken
out against the chain, which apparently
donated food to the organizations that
discourage same sex marriage.

Rainbow Alliance President James
Weaver said he finds the company’s
stance insulting to its LGBT custom-
ers. ’ ' ‘ , ‘

“I am very angry that [Chick-fil-A]
gladly takes the money of LGBT indi-
viduals, but clearly does ‘not care about
their rights,” Weaver said.—

James Weaver:

1 am very angry

Tricia Dougherty, political action

. manager of Rainbow Alliance, thinks '

the continued selling and distribut-
ing of the products is evidence of Pitt
not taking a strong enough ‘stance for
LGBT rights. '

“I believe that Pitt should strive to
create a welcoming environment for
all of its" students,“ Dougherty said.
“And that in order for that environ-
ment to be continued it needs to take
action against Chick—fil-A or risk im-
plicitly supporting discrimination of

’ University, Sodexo will nottake action against the fast-food franchise

LGBT individuals on our campus and
elsewhere.” p

_ “I would like to see the University
strongly reconsider their partnership,”
Weaver said.,“I believe_it is inappro-
priate for the University tohsupport a
companythat "funds anti-gay groups,

esp_ecially because LGBT individuals ,

are protected under the University’s
anti-dis_cri.mi'nat_ion policy.”

The company has a religious message
in portions of its.operations. Chick-
fil—A franchises close on Sundays and

a portion of its website states that the
company’s purpose is “To glorify God
by being a faithful steward of all that
is entrusted to us. To have a positive
inﬂuence on all who come in contact
with Chick—fil-A.” 

A representative of Chick—fil-A re-
leased a statement on the subj_ect from
the company’s president, Dan Cathy.
The representative declined to com-
ment any further. . .

The statement said that the current
discoveries are more ofa misinterpre-

tation of the owner’s biblical support

~' of marriage, rather than an anti-gay '

message onthe part of the company
itself.- ' , - '

“Recently, there have been some mis-
leading stories about Chick—fil-A in the
media and on the Internet,” Cathy said
in_ the statement. “While my family and
I believe in the biblical definition of
‘marriage, we love and respect anyone
who disagrees.”

Some students have argued that sup- »

porting anti—same—sex-marriage orga-

. that [Chick-ﬁl -A] glad] takes the
money of LGBT individ

Z uals but clearly oes not care
about their rights. C S   -

nizations displays disrespect for the
LGBT community. Others have followed
in Senior Kait Marcinek’s footsteps by
reducing their visits to the Chick~fil-A
on campus. , . ‘
“Seriously, when I found out about
the anti-gay message that Chick—fil-A
endorses I almost completely stopped
buying their food,” senior Kait Marcinek
said. “I used to eat Chick—fil-A two or

three times a week, now I maybe go '

twice a month.” I

  Pitt, citywork to keep 

Oakland peaceful

Oakland 4 1

Some students, despite the defeat, gathered
near the stage.

“F*ck Green Bay! F*ck Green Bay!” they .

chanted. .

The catchy, synthesized beats of the Black
Eyed Peas and Ke$ha soon drowned out the
fan’s disgruntled cries. -

This appeared to leave the police on Bigelow
with little to do. Around 10:15 p.m., about 10
minutes after the game ended, 60 riot police
with shields and long wooden stickslined the

streets between the Cathedral and the William

Pitt Union.

Although the strongest police presence
could be felt on campus, more police gathered
around Forbes and McKee. More than 75 police
oﬂicers gathered there with 15 horses and a
Long Range Acoustic Device. The LRAD, which
was used during the G—2o_ Summit, uses high-
decible sound emissions to control crowds.

But a mere half-hour after the Packers were
declared the national football champions,

police began packing up their gear. The ones ,

gathered on Forbes and McKee piled into a Port
Authority bus. The ones who didn’t ﬁt walked
to Posvar Hall, which served as a type of base
for ofﬁcers. They begantaking off their gear
right when dancing started on Bigelow.

Unlike the Super Bowl two years ago, the

‘students were relatively subdued. Most stu-

dents were huddled in groups, either watch-
ing the screen or taking pictures. No one was
burning ‘couches near campus.As the police
presence dissipated, so too did the sting of the
Steelers’ loss for some who gathered.
Freshman Michael Griﬂin was with a group
of friends hanging out by the sidewalk next
to the stage. Calling the celebration a “post-
game pissed—off party,” Grifﬁn said he’d prob-
ably stick around for an hour beforeheading
home.
Marc McGrae was similarly resigned about
the game. ’ _ _
“We were still in the Super Bowl. That’s rea-
son enough to celebrate,” the freshman said.
Earlier in the day, Bonner said the celebra-
tion was scheduled to last one hour. Police
stuck to that schedule. At 11:15 pm., police
began ushering students off of Bigelow Bou-

levard. In a, matter of minutes, the area was

cleared and ttafﬁc was moving.

“You shoulda’ been here two years ago,” a
girl said in passing to her friend.

Todafs difficulty ‘level: Hard Fans live for the game

V Ohad Cadji l Staff Photographer

Oakland resident Vijai Jaitley reacts to the Steelers’ loss to the Green Bay Packers in the

of athletes, many fans set themselves up for
disappointment when they ﬁnd that they
can’t control the outcome, Kimball said.

i »“We sit-here and=we‘wave‘our'Terrible
Towels hoping to affect the outcome of the
game some way,” she said. ”But the reality
is that it doesn’t make that much of a differ-
ence, yet someone who is highly invested in
the team wants to believe that in some way
they are affecting the team.”

Kimball likened the mannerisms of die- T

hard fans to a form of obsessive compulsive

- disorder, saying that the ritualistic game day

behaviors of many fans ‘remain the same
season after season, from wearing the same
jersey every game to insisting everyone re-
main quiet during certain plays.

These behaviors are somewhat irrational,

Kimball said, given that they ultimately don’t

have an effect on the outcome of the game. ,

One thing Kimball has noticed about fans is
the way they associate themselves with the
team differently -after a win or a loss.

For example, when the team wins, fans
will say “we won,” but if the team loses, fans

will say, “they lost.” It’s the association with ~ T

a winning team that often keeps fans com-
ing back. - ~

One such die—hard fan is Devon Pleasant, ~

a Pitt housekeeper who said he has been a fan
of the Steelers since he was a child.

For Pleasant, being a Steelers fan means
having the expectation that the team will

Super Bowl Sunday.

win every game, and when the team loses,‘
especially in big games like the Super Bowl,
Pleasant said he feels “crushed” — like the
team has let him. down. 3 T ' P

‘‘I’m happy for the whole week when the

Steelers win and very angry for that night

when they lose,” he said.

The way Kenneth Boas, a professor .of _

sports literature at Pitt, sees it, this asso-
ciation with a team is a distraction from
everyday life.

“It’s easier in some ways to put your life
in other people’s hands. In terms of sports,
we love the game and we cheer our home
team on and when we lose we take it very
hard, but that’s a much easier blow to take,"
and one that’s fairly easy to recover from,”
he said. .

But for the most part, fansseém to un-
derstand the nature of the game, which, as
Boas puts it, has a “built in mechanism” to
help fans get over a loss. '

There’s always the promise of the next
game, and it’s long been the trope of a de-
feated fan to. say, ‘‘we’ll get ’em next year.”

“In the long run, it’s not going to really
make that much difference. Of course they’ll
be very disappointed if they lose and very
happy if they win,” Boas said. “But I think
most sports fans understand the nature of
the game and that winning and losing is
part of it and there’s a built—in acceptance
of that reality.” [

Free condoms,  
please‘-’      

Roommates can often serve as ob-

stacles to you getting all the action
you want and probably deserve.
But another problematic barrier
for some is the cost of birth con-
trol. While pregnancy is surely an
— expensive endeavor, preventing it
is also expensive for females. Oral
contraceptives can cost up to $60
a month, and condoms generally
’ retail at around $8 for a 12-pack.
According to The New York
Times, the Obama administra-
tion is considering whether the
new health-care law can include
provisions that require insurance
plans to offer contraceptives and
other family—planning services to
women free of charge. ‘ . .
Although such measures would
serve to reduce some of the unin-
tended pregnancies in the United
States — and about half of U.S.
' pregnancies are unintended — just
because an oral contraceptive is
available doesn’t mean it will be
used correctly.
However, we feel that free or

, reduced cost contraceptives would ’

be beneﬁcial to women of certain
ages —— including college students.
We especially advocate for free or

A less-expensive condoms for in-
sured individuals of certain ages .

— not because we’re extremely
horny or anything —_ but because
this would remove any oral con-
traceptive controversy or sexism
from the mix. In addition, provid-
ing free orreduced-rate condoms
would also be proactive in protect-
ing against sexually transmitted
infection.

While we don’t necessary want
to promote more sex by promot-
ing cheaper or free birth control,
we can’t deny the fact that a lot of
young people want to and will ﬁnd
a way to have sex. Any resulting
unintended pregnancies are con-
sequently life changing; Prevent-

-ing these, “accidents.” gan only be _ l

a positive advancement.

- We believe birth control isa

surers are supposed tocover free

against free birth control holds

I that pregnancy is not a “disease”

that requires prevention-
But we’ have to argue that

- there are legitimate health risks
involved in pregnancy — espe-

cially for young girls. According
to The National Women’s Health
Information Center, pregnancy-
related health problems include,
but are not limited to, anemia, de-
pression and high blood pressure.
In addition, pre—existing‘health
complications can be worsened
by pregnancy. ‘ ’
Because the preventive services
offered to women at no cost under
the health—care law will not be de-
termined until Aug. 1, we recom-
mend consulting Student Health
Services for more affordable birth
control. Oral contraceptives are

sold — with prescription — for“

about $15 to $30 for certain brands
and might even cost less with your
insurance. Condoms are also avail-
able at reduced cost for $3.50 and
$4 for 12-packs. .

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

A t‘Bloody Angle’ on history  

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

TheCivil War lives on in~.the.tour-
ism of its battleﬁelds. These loca-
tions housed some of thebloodi-
est battles Americans have ever
fought. Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor
andithe Siege of Petersburg were
grim foreshadowings of the trench
warfare of World War I. New tech-
nologies such as the Minié ball,
riﬂed artillery and barbed wire
transformed the battleﬁeld in ways
that many leaders failed to’ grasp.
The battles spanned our nation:
Some engagements were fought
as far west as New Mexico, and the
most important strategic objective
of the war, control of the Missis-
sippi River, had to. be achieved a
thousand miles away from Wash-
ington, D.C. and Richmond Va.

A few of the battleﬁelds
have been forgotten or built over.
Others are seriously threatened
by development. A few have been
preserved in a condition very simi-
lar to what they were at the time. I
have had the good fortune to visit
four such battleﬁelds: Gettysburg,
Antietam/Sharpsburg, Stones Riv-
er/Murfreesboro and Bull Run/ Ma-

nassas. Despite a lifelong personal
interest in the Civil War, the war
itselfseemed abstract until I made
those visits. In commemoration of
150 years since the start of the Civil

.» War, it is time that you gain the

same connection to the conﬂict:
Visit a battleﬁeld. ‘

The ﬁrst battleﬁeld you
should visit is one administered by
the National Park" Service. These
are usually well—preserved and

have helpful plaques throughout.
-Your ﬁrst stop should deﬁnitely be '

the visitor’s center, where maps
are .available with explanations of
the battle itself. If there is a park
ranger leading a tour, take one.
They are fantastic. Alternately, if

you’ve got a friend who is a Civil-

War buff, drag him along and he’ll
talk your ears off about why the

I hill you’re standing on might just

be one of the most important hills
in American history.
Why should we visit bat-

' tleﬁelds? Because in so doing we

make sense of the battles. What I
have found most striking is that the
logical order of a battle map dis-
solves when actually on the ﬁeld.
Further, many of the maps printed
in books simply don’t reﬂect the

- reality of the ﬁeld. Many of these

maps are not topographical, which

means that they convey no infor-
mation about elevation. This omis-
sion is especially important in the
case of Antietam, where the coun-
tryside ended up blocking General
McClellan’s view, leading him‘ to
commit tactical blunders. One rise
in particular allowed General Lee
to conceal some important troop
movements. The bluff overlooking
Antietam Creek at the Rohrbach
Bridge allowed 400 Confeder-
ate riﬂemen to hold off General
Bumside’s entire corps for several
hours. On a ﬁat map, none of this
is clear. On the ﬁeld itself, all of it
is obvious.

On a battleﬁeld, another
thing is obvious: the courage of the
men of both sides. The Confeder:
ates who attacked Cemetery Ridge
on the third ‘day of Gettysburg had
to cross a mile of open ground to
reach Federal lines. Standing at
the Bloody Angle gives the visi-

tor a true appreciation of what an ‘

inviting target those 15,000 men
must have made, advancing with-
out cover over a plain. Conversely,

Writer finds irony in printing paper-wastesarticle on paper

Mike Good
For The Pitt News

I was raised on a simple premise:-s

There is no greater sin one can

Eommit than waste. Often re’-‘
minded of the realities of starv— .
ing Asian civilizations, I choked -

down crusts of grilled cheese and
each green pea on my plate. Nowa-
days, the only thing that upsets me
more than watching other people
waste‘ things is when I am forced

I to waste things myself. This recurs
each time I print an assignment at

a Pitt computer lab. The amount
of paper we waste on cover sheets
baffles me. I

‘ Regardless of how cheaply Pitt
can or does purchase computer
paper, the current practice strikes
me as nonsensical, noneconomic
and unsustainable. In a word:
wasteful.

Consider the number of trips .

you take to the computer lab to
print material each week. Multi-
ply that out over a semester, and
then over a year and then over four
years. Then consider the 18,000
undergraduate students at the
University. If each student merely

prints one assignment per semes-
ter and graduates in four years,
that already amounts to 150,000
pieces of paper wasted on cover
sheets. .
There are multiple solutions
to thecover-sheet waste, and I
ﬁnd it odd that the status ‘quo is
so easily accepted. According to
Pitt’s official statement on sus-

Couldn’t there be a printing
feature added to allow students to-
queue the day’s print into one ﬁnal
print job? Iam not naive enough
to believe each student could or
would takelthe time to plan on the
foresight to arrange and concen-
trate printing visits; nevertheless,
this would help.‘_Could we at least
ﬂip used cover sheets over and re-

ments, but said he would happily
do away with cover sheets if there
were a better solution for separat-
ing each student’s pages.

If the lab could at least print the
ﬁrst page of the document on the
back of the "cover sheet, I would
have no qualms. But I don’t see the
need to trash a sheet of paper every
time I print a paper that I will, in

Regardless of how cheaply Pitt can or

current practice strikes me as nonsensical,

noneconomic and unsustainable.

tainability, Pitt attempts to “fos—
ter environmentally responsible
purchasing practices by striving
to balance short— and long—term,
maintenance, life cycle and en-
vironmental costs in purchasing
goods and services, with sound
ﬁscal practices.” .

So‘let’s foster some environ-
mentally respolnsible practices,
eh?

« load them? That would cut waste
. in half.

The most practical solution
seems to me to be to- forgo the
necessity of the cover -sheet, and
instead print the cover-sheet in-
formation as a header or water-

mark on the ﬁrst page. Lyle Mroz,-

a computer—lab consultant at Pitt,
voiced aesthetic concerns about
usernames appearing on assign-

all likelihood, wind up trashing
anyway. ’

Of course, there would also be
administrative obstacles. Pitt pro-
fessors would have to consent to
the shadow of a‘ student’s e-mail '
lurking beneath the text or as a
permanent header. Or even worse:
a ‘green, pink, or blue ﬁrst page.
But if you teach here, and you’re
not willing to" make that sacriﬁce,"

I think you’re a waste,of my tuition
anyway. How about accepting as-
signments electronically?

In terms of manufacturing,
paper production and consump-
tion ranks among of the top-ﬁve
contributors to climate change
— from deforestation to trans-
forming deforested wood to pa-
per to ultimately accounting for

. _25 percent of U.S. landﬁll mass.

As acountry, we triple China’s pa-
per consumption and are by far
the largest paper consumer. If the

.United States cut its paper waste v

by 10.percent, it would be environ-
mental-improvement equivalent
to removing 280,000 cars from
the road.

So take a step forward. This
University has a responsibility
to its student body and the com-
munity not to waste its resources
and to follow the policy it claims
to follow. The issue is as simple as
a sheet of paper.

Federal I Corps faced in the ﬁrst
minutes of Antietam.

These realizations con-
spire with other intangibles to
make the battle seem more real

to us. The ﬁrst time I visited Get- _

tysburg was in late August. The
weather was very similar to that

which greeted Pickett’s Charge:
nearly 90-degrees and very humid.

- Walkingaround all day was tiring

to say the least, and I wasn’t even
wearing a woolen jacket like the
soldiers did. The second time I was
at Gettysburg I had a very eerie
experience. At a series of jumbled

rocks called Devil’s Den, Ilooked _i

at the soil and saw something that
_ was yellow-white. It appeared to .

be the end of a human collarbone.
On further examination, I realized

it was nothing more than a rock. ’

I tittered at my melodramatic
assumption that it was a human
remain. Yet in anothersense, my
reaction — melodramatic almost

anywhere else — was completely
reasonable there. I was standing at
a spot where someone my age may
have been killed or wounded. After
visiting Antietam, I have a similar
experience every time.-

experience. No other experience
can so neatly bridge the 150 years
that separate us from our nation’s
bloodiest conﬂict.

FEATURE

Divorce inspires ‘After

For The Pitt News

The topic of divorce often evokes
silence and sadness, but one art-
ist has used this negative experi-
ence as inspiration. . '
Jill Larson’s exhibit “After
the Sky Has Fallen,” showing
at the 709 Penn’Gallery down-
town through Feb. 20, is an in-
stallation piece celebrating her
re—emergence after an arduous
divorce process. '
Larson’s inspiration for the
exhibit raises questions about

the impact divorce has on our

  Jill Larson:

society. Speaking on the way the
idea of divorce has affected cur-
rent views of relationships, Pitt
sociology professor Christine
Whelan said, “Although the di-
vorce rate isn’t as high as you’d

. think among college graduates, it

is in the back of couples’ minds.
"Til death do us part’ is now ‘un-
til someone better comes along.’
Americans love the institution of
marriage, so much so that they
do it over and over.”

In “After the Sky Has Fallen,”
soft light emphasizes a 12-foot
cocoon meticulously woven
from thousands of divorce docu-
ments. Larson said that making
the piece “wasn’t therapeutic at

‘ all. I am pretty removed from
I I that time in my life, so I shred-

ded them very methodically.

But she did pay attention to
what the words conveyed when
she crafted the structure.

“I wanted slight variation —
whether it was two sentences or
‘three showing. I was particular
if certain words showed, and the
placement of where they were

the . Sky Has_ Fallen’

Randi Alu _'

on the cocoon wasn’t' entirely
random,” she said. ' '

The cocoon hangs over a dirt
bed which gives the room an
earthy, natural smell. ‘The dirt
is scattered with the “fallen skyz”
glass boxes showing images of
the sky and filled with water.

Warm—toned, monochromatic

photos titled “Under the Covers”
hang from the walls, commu-
nicating the comforting feeling
and safety of a different type of
self—made cocoon. The images
are intended to be reminiscent
of childhood, when a hide—out
under bedcovers was “a peaceful

and tranquil place during times '

of turmoil,” according to the
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.

The paper cocoon itself
is sculpted as if bursting open
and empty inside, intimating

‘ the image of a_ butterﬂy ﬁnally

emancipated from the entrap-
ment of a tragic ordeal.

“It is common after any trau-
matic event, including divorce,
to feel the need to ‘reemerge,”’
Whelan said. Larson’s installa-

tion makes this rebirthing idea‘

a visual experience.

“One of the things I try to do I 
I in my artwork is take something

that is not necessarily a good
experience and transforming it
into more of a beautiful object,”
Larson said. . ‘ 4
The work of art was ultimate-
ly the combinationof personal
endeavor and social commentary
on the prevalence of divorce.
-“My artwork commonly
comes from a personal place,
but I think it speaks on a univer-
sal level,” Larson said. “I’m not
alone in this experience.”

Larson’s exhibit focuses on a re—emergence, speciﬁcally the one she experienced after her divorce. The

-MOVIE REVIEW

 Garden gnomes not a  
meant for Shakespeare

Courtesy Disney Interactive~Media Group
Gnomeo and Juliet might be adorable characters, but this garden decor-inspired

Shakespeare adaptation has more than a few cracks.

Natalie Bell
A&E Editor

“Gnomeo &]uliet”

Starring Emily Blunt and James McA-
voy ‘
Directed by Kelly Asbury

Grade: C

“Gnomeo &Juliet” really had the poten-
tial to shatter to pieces like a smiling,
ceramic gardengnome on concrete.
It’s the story of “Romeo andjuliet” A
— played out with gnomes. The movie '
clearly had a lot working against it —
taking on a Shakespearean tragedy using
lawn decorations, cramming in musical
numbers and doing it all in 3—D..That’s
not to say it couldn’t have been done.
Three dimensions aside, this wouldn’t
be the ﬁrst time animators attempted to
take on the Bard in a nonconventional
manner. “The Lion King” serves as a
splendid example of how to make Shake-
spearean tragedy accessible to children,
music and all. But “Gnomeo andjuliet” is
_.no “Lion King.”
A With the ﬁlm taking place in a back-
' yard, the animation was vivid and full of
entertaining visual details — things like
the male gnome in a thongjswimsuit or
Wisteria waving gently from a toilet bowl
planter. Unfortunately, the 3-D added a‘

headache and took away fromthe spec-
tacle. Some of the background images
weren’t even in focus.
To its credit, the movie does have

some adorablecharacters and a~plo_t

that — at least most of the time —— sticks
to the script. James McAvoy and Emily
Blunt are completely charming, even as
Dutch—looking ornamentation. Shroom, “T
Gnomeo’s silent, loyal fungus compan-
ion, is incredibly adorable.

But with a clear attempt to water »

' down a serious plot, the movie doesn’t'

hold any of the emotional gravity of a
Shakespeare play — or “The Lion King”
for that matter. Tybalt does get smashed,
but he returns glued together for a
curtain—call dance number a la “Shrek.”
The total lack of tragedy might seem
appealing for a kids’ ﬂick, but almost any
classic animation tale has some darker
points — see: “The Fox and the Hound,”

v “Bambi” —— and those make them memo-

rable.

And, yes, there are hilarious and
happy plots that are successful, but
“Gnomeo &]uliet” lacked any of the witty
sparkle it could have had. “Toy Story
3,” for example, managed to brilliantly
include allusions to well—known movies,
and although “Gnomeo” does have a few
amusing references and adult humor,
the jokes for kids fall ﬂat. Innuendo,

‘like when Juliet’s nurse Nanette inquires‘

FASHION COLUMN

Look like a lady, evenin

clothing tailored for men

Bethie Girmai
Columnist

In last week’s episode of E!’s “Fashion Po-
lice,” HBIC (Head Bitch In Charge)]oan Riv:
ers voted Cate Blanchett the best—dressed
celebrity of the week. Blanchett earned the
title thanks to a Dries Van Noten suit she
wore to an event in Switzerland. The star
paired a classic white button—down with a

' black tuxedo—style blazer and crisp, ﬂared
white pants. She supplemented her outﬁt

with a slicked—back ’do and afresh face. The
result was innovative and clean cut.
Blanchett’s outﬁt asks the question, is
menswear for women the new black?
Julie Bowen seemed to think so. The
“Modern Family” actress rounded out the
week by emulating 'Blanchett’s look on the

- red carpet at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.

Bowen wore a black Catherine Malandrino
pantsuit accessorized with diamond clips.
Unfortunately, Bowen missed the mark,

though a few accessory changes and an updo
could have landed her on the best~dressed
list as well. '

Blanchett and Bowen are by no means , I

the ﬁrst to rock menswear. Actress Diane
Keaton has been sporting menswear-in-
spired looks for decades and even before
her, the late Katharine Hepburn brokedown

"trend. . A

with cufflinks and leave ample room in the
crotch. ‘ ' ’

The clean lines and simple silhouettes V

are anobvious draw, but thére’s more to this

Overall, the movie avoided being the

considering other brilliantly crafted

more than a few cracks that make it just
mediocre.

it’s the former.

sends a message to men that we can do ev-

' In the office, menswear on women says,
“When I become the CEO of this company,
I’m ﬁring all the chauvinists ﬁrst.” At a fam-
ily gathering, it says, “There’s no way that
smug Aunt Sophie would dare to make a com-
parison between meand her snotty daughter
now.” And the rest of the time, it just says,
“Even though I’m dressed like a man, I have

Fashion is an art form and a means of

So fellow fashionistas, take a chance

With 7:34 remaining in Super Bowl XLV
last night, Ben Roethlisberger found
receiver Mike Wallace for a touchdown
and Antwaan Randle El followed with

a two-point conversion, making the

, score 28-25 in favor of Green Bay.

When the Steelers defense held the
Packers to a ﬁeld goal that gave Green
Bay a slim 31-25 lead with just more
than two minutes remaining, Stee1— 2
ers fans everywhere were hoping for a
repeat of Roethlisberger’s famous win-
ning drive two years ago in Super Bowl

But there was no thrilling, last—min-

There was no thrilling, last-minute “

Following a Pittsburgh field goal,
Green Bay took advantage of another
Roethlisberger interception. A four-
play, 53-yard drive, capped by a 21-
yard touchdown pass from Rodgers to
wide receiver Gregjennings, gave the
Packers a commanding 21-3 lead with

S 2:24 left in the first half.

But despite being down by 18, the
Steelers were far from finished.
Roethlisberger responded by throwing
a touchdown pass to receiver Hines
Ward with less than a‘ minute left in the
half, cutting the deficit to 21-10 going

into the break. — ~

The Steelers continued their come-
back as running back Rashard Mend-
enhall rumbled into the end zone from
9 yards out early in the third quarter,
narrowing Green Bay’s lead to 21-17.

But it was Mendenhall who lost that
momentum on the opening play of the
fourth quarter.

Win this time for Pittsburgh as the
Packers defense held.  

Super Bowl title in franchise history.

The Steelers only picked up one
ﬁrst down on their final drive of the
game, and when’Roethlisberger’s
fourth-down pass to Wallace hit the
ground, hopes for a third Super Bowl
victory in sixyyears ended. .

Following two weeks of speculation
and hype leading up to the game, it was
Green Bay who drew first blood with
3:44 left in the first quarter as quarter-
back Aaron Rodgers floated a 29-yard .
touchdown pass to wide receiverjordy
Nelson to give the Packers an early 7-0
lead.

It would only take them 24 seconds
to double that lead.

On the first play from scrimmage af-

ter the ensuing kickoff, Roethlisberger -

dropped back and appeared to have
Wallace open for a deep pass down the
left. But Green Bay defensive tackle

- B.J. Raji got a piece of Roethlisberger’s

arm onthe throw, and his weakened
pass was intercepted by Nick Collins.
Collins returned the ‘ball 37 yards for
the Packers’ second touchdown in
three plays. -

With the Steelers in Green Bay ter-
ritory, the Packers star defensive end
Clay Matthews forced a Mendenhall

BASKETBALL ROIJNDUP

Men’s, Women’s teams win, players hit records

Ben Livingston, Kelly Flanigan
Staff Writers

Men’s basketball
No. 4 Pitt 71, Cincinnati 59

With forwards Dante Taylor and Lamar
Patterson out of action, guard play

was bound to be key for the Pitt men’s
basketball team in its Saturd_ay matchup
with Cincinnati. .

Pitt needed a clutch performance
in the backcourt, and Ashton Gibbs
answered the call.-

Gibbs sunk ﬁve 3-pointers on ﬁve
attempts, and ﬁnished with a game—high
25 points as the No. 4 Panthers (21-2, 9-1
Big East) -won 71-59 over Cincinnati (18-
4, 6-4 Big East).

The junior guard seemed unstoppable V H

and took advantage of nearly every
scoring opportunity he received. Thanks
to his teammates, Gibbs received plenty
of them.

“My teammates are doing a great
job of ﬁnding me in open spots and
screening,” Gibbs said after the game. “I
just take what the defense gives me.”

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon was
pleased with Gibbs’ performance on
both sides of the ball.

“I thought Ashton played very good
defense,” Dixon said after the game.

Cincinnati head coach Mick Cronin
lauded Gibbs for sticking to his
strengths.

“Gibbs is one of the best players in
the country,” Cronin said after the game.
“He’s turned himself into a great, great
player by doing what he’s good at.

The Panthers began the ﬁrst half on a
tear, jumping out to a 15-6 lead fueled by
three early 3—pointers from Gibbs. They
cooled off a bit before roaring ahead to

*1 lead by 23 early in the second half.

But the Bearcats came back to within
eight points of Pitt late in the game,
something that concerned Gibbs.

“It’s how you ﬁnish that really
counts,” Gibbs said. ‘_‘We really slacked a
little bit as a team in the second half.”

The Panthers shot an impressive 46.8
percent from the field and played sound
defense, but committed 18 turnovers
and were outrebounded 40-38.‘

Gilbert Brown though the turnovers
hurt Pitt down the stretch.

“We had a couple silly turnovers in
the second half,” Brown said.

As for the rebounding, Gary McGhee
pulled down 13 boards, but wasn’t too
happy with the way Pitt attacked the
glass.

“We didn’t give as good of an effort
as we usually do on the glass tonight,”
McGhee said. i

The absences of Taylor and Patterson
might have reduced Pitt’s effectiveness

b

in the paint. The two have combined to
average 8.8 points and 6.8 rebounds off

‘ the bench this season.

Taylor missed the game due to a
left-knee injury, and‘Patterson was
suspended for the game. ’

Dixon explained the suspension in a
written statement released before the
contest: v

“Lamar Patterson will be suspended
for tonight’s contest against Cincinnati
for disciplinary reasons. The one—game
suspension stems from his involvement
in a December incident that took place
off-campus,” the statement said.

Cincinnati forward Yancy Gates was
also suspended for,Saturday’s contest,
due to an unspecified violation of team
rules. 4

Gates was the second—leading scorer
for the Bearcats_ entering the game, but
his head coach dismissed any notion
that the Bearcats needed Gates to win.

“I really believe that did not have any
effect on the game,” Cronin said.

Women’s basketball
Pitt 60, No. 14 West Virginia 53

Ashton Gibbs wasn’t the only Pitt
basketball guard to record a career-high
point total Saturday night — Taneisha
Harrisorfs 30 points led the Panthers to

an upset road win at rival West Virginia. '

The Panthers (11-11, 3-6 Big East)-
snapped the No. 14 Mountaineers
(2o—4, 6-4 Big East) 31-game home
winning streak, the third longest in the
country, -by a score of 60-53 on Saturday
afternoon. I

Harrison’s 30 points included a _
career-best ﬁve 3-pointers, and she
became the ﬁrst player since Shavonte
Zellous in 2009 to score 30 or more
points in a single game. -

Senior Chelsea Cole contributed 11

points for the Panthers in the upset.

To add to the night of career-bests
and snapped winning streaks, Pitt was
ironically the last team to defeat the
Mountaineers on their home court in

February of last year by a score of 70-62.

Both teams played strong defense, as
Pitt held the Mountaineers scoreless for
nine minutes, and West Virginia did the

. same to the Panthers for a seven-minute

stretch in the ﬁrst half. .
Likely due to the hard—nosed defense
of ‘both teams, the game came down to
the very ﬁnal seconds of the contest.
West Virginia took its ﬁrst lead of the
game since the opening minute with just
2:40 remaining. The score was 53-49.
But the Mountaineers could not
contain Harrison. She answered again,

shortly after by a -bucket in the paint
from Cole. Pitt took the lead 54-53 ‘with
1:36 remaining in the game.

When West Virginia turned the ball
over on their next possession, Harrison
knocked down yet another three. The
Mountaineers were forced to foul, and
redshirt freshman Ashlee Anderson hit
three of four from the charity stripe,

career-high 25 points in the win.

team’s 11-0 unanswered run to close out

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Panthers set for another  

Backyard Brawl  

Greg Trietley

Senior Staﬁ‘ Writer _

The last time the Pitt men’slbasketbal1
team played‘West Virginia, the Panthers
overcame a seven—point deﬁcit in the
ﬁnal 45 seconds and won what became
— an hour or so later — the longest
home game in their history._Pitt emerged
from the 180th edition of the Backyard
Brawl basketball edition, its 12 ‘lead
changes and its 12 ties, with a 98-95
'triple—overtime Victory. j V a '

‘powerhouse No. 4_Mo’untaineers of last
season now hover inthe middle of the A
Big East pack. But Monday night, it_’s still
West Virginia and Pitt, and it’s still the

Backyard'Brawl at 7 p.m. in Morgantowri.

And’the.No. 4 Panthers (21—2, 9-1

G Big East) still have Ashton Gibbs, who

scored 24 points in the last edition of

' the Brawl —- including a late 3-pointer

that capped the wild comeback and sent
th_e game iznto overtime. He has been

Cincinnati out-rebounded Pitt in
Taylor’s absence, and the Panthers face
another strong rebounding team on
Monday. West Virginia’s Kevinjones (7.1

rebounds/game) andjohn Flowers (6.6 — .

rebounds/game) make Bob Huggins’
Mountaineers a tough group to play
against in the paint. V .

“Last year whenwe went down there. .

we got outplayed,” forward Gilbert
Brown said.V“Several of us were shut out.
It’s going to be a battle, but we want to

especially for us seniors.”

Taylor, Brown and Brad Wanamaker
all went scoreless in Morgantown last
season. . 1 — ’

the most dependable Panther recently,
scoring 25 points in a 71-59‘win over
Cincinnati Saturday night. ' V V
“Things are clicking more for me,”

Gibbs said after Pitt’s win over the V —.
Bearcats. “Ihave to give credit to my V
teammates on getting me the open shot
by moving andVscreening.” ' 4 V

‘Rutgers last week. The rest of the team
had nine baskets total, but the Big East’s
leader in per—game 3—pointers had 24 4
points. ,

The Panthers had to relyon Gibbs a , A

little ‘bit more than usual Saturday night,

as forward Dante Taylor missed the
game with a sore knee. The injury forced
Gary McGhee to play a season—high 33

_ minutes.

Pitt head coachjamie Dixon called
Taylor a game-time decision for '
Monday’s meeting with the No. 25
Mountaineers (15-7, 6-4 Big East),

"We’ll see how [the knee] is,” Dixon

, said after Saturday’s win. “He was pretty

‘team rules but went scorelesswinglg

. ‘ “It wasn’t good last year when we ’ ’ » ~
went down there,” Wanamaker said. “We
got outplayed all around.” _

The Mountaineers lost their last '
game, a 66-50 defeatat the hands of No.-
12 Villanova Saturday afternoon; Leading
scorer Casey Mitchell (16.6 pqfints/game).
returned from a-suspension forljyiolating

 
 

   

‘minutes offithe bench.  ;-—

Huggins never disclosed the speciﬁcs
of why Mitchell was suspended.

Pitt’s last loss came onjan. 24 against
No. 15 Notre Dame, when the Fighting
Irish ran the “burn” game plan that
slowed the tempo — and the Panthers’

‘ offense — to a crawl; Although the

strategy worked against Pitt that night,
Wanamaker said he’d be surprised if
West Virginia used it Monday. _
“Slowing the pace of the game down
worked for‘Notre Dame,”he said. “I
don’t thinkthere is any team that can do

it better than [the Fighting Irish] ‘do, so I

doubt we’ll ‘see that.” I
