Dance Ruling Made

By Charles B. Holstein

Like the platform of England's
Labor party to institute socialism "in
our time,” that of the Council of
Presidents of Social Fraternities
seems to be aimed toward organiza-
tion of an Intei'fraternity Council on
this campus before the year designat-
ed for CPSF’s existence expires.

A step closer to their objective, the
13 irat.ernity presidents who comprise
CPSF‘ have been given copies of a
proposed constitution for a new I-F
Council to take back to their individ-
ual houses for discussion. The draft
of the constitution was presented at
the meeting VVednesd-ay .iiight by
James Vvills, C35, Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon, chairman of a. special coininit-
tee delegated to draw it up.

After exchanges of greetings hand-
clasps, and ritual niumblings Monday
night, approximately 450 members of
inen’s social fraternities will have an
opportunity of voicing sentiment, not
only on this measure, but on radical
changes in rushing procedure for
next fall as embodied in a committee
report by Henry George, M35, Pi Kap-
pa Alpha, chairman of a rushing rules
revision committee. This report was
read by George in a preliminary hear-
ing for CPSF over a steak dinner at
the Phi Epsilon Pi house.

-, Four New Proposals Listed

Besides hearing these t.wo reports,
CPSF also adopted a. drastic change
in this semester’s
starts ‘Wednesday morning, by limit-
ing each house to only one orc_hestra_
dance during the season.

VVills’ sample constitution lists four
proposals which differ widely from
the constitution followed b-y Interfra-
ternity Council up to last May, when
University recognition was with-
drawn from that body and the Coun-
cil disbanded:

1. Electlﬂn--0f:-.01ﬁG€l‘S.8113,11 ..be‘ by"

the Hare system of preferential ‘bal-
lot, and all fraternity men on campus
will be enfranchised.

2. An executive board of ﬁve stu-
dents will be formed of those who
rate highest in the election, the four
leaders winning oilices of president,
vice president, secretary, and treas-
urer, in order of their standing, and
the ﬁfth man remaining merely as a
voting member of the board without
office.

 Amendments to the Constitution
shall be voted upon only on the sec-
ond submission.

4. Special meetings shall be called
only upon requisition of ten members.
The president shall be powerless to
call such meetings without such a. re-
qulsition. -

“Adviser May Only Advise”

Otherwise the organization will re-
semble the old I-F body. Membership
shall include the presidents and one
other representative from each house.

However, unlike the CPSF‘ set-up,
the executive board will not include
the adviser of the group as a. voting
member, and will retain an adviser
“only in an advisory capacity.”

At present, N. Robert Seidle, as-
sistant to the dean of men and C-PSF
adviser, sits as the ﬁfth voting mem-
ber of the executive board. Creation
of a position for a. ﬁfth student on
this board is designed, according to
Wills, to take over Mr. Seidle’s func-
tion of gua.rding against ties of 2-2 in
executive board voting.

The Hare system of voting, says
Wills, will cut to a minimum any
chance of poli-tical machinations de-
ciding in advance the outcome of
elections, and should eliminate any
such factional strife as led to old
Council's disastrous “May days” last
year. By allowing all fraternity men
to vote, instead of just representa-
tives of houses, the Council will have
ofﬁcers who will be really representa-
tive, in his opinion.

Four Main Rush Changes

George's rushing report also includ-
ed changes and innovations, recom-
mending, among other things:

1. Moving the rushing season up
from the second to the first week of
the semester, and lengthening the
season from 10 to 11 days.

2. Creating a four-day restricted
period in the beginning of the season
during which rushees may attend

-only one event at any one fraternity.

During this period all invitations
must be registered in the oﬁice of the
dean of men, and rushees failing to
keep accepted engagements will be
open to penalty.

3. That eligibility standards for
initiation shall be raised from 12
credit, 8 quality point standing to 12-
credit, 10 quality point standing.

4. That an interfrateriiity freshman
dinner shall be held the first day of
the semester to which all freshmen
indicating intention of joining frater-
nities will be invited. At this dinner,
attempts. will be ma.de “to stimulate
interest in fraternity men and new
students; to impress upon new stu-
dents the honor of receiving a. frater-
nity bid; to encourage . . friendly
relations between various fraterni-
ties on the eve of rushing; and to
present and emphasize
ance of fraternity criteria.”

Placement Bureau Plan Will Aid
Employment Of Graduates

J. C. Barton. director of the Place-
ment bureau, has justconipleted a di-
rect mail campaign to industrial firms
in Allegheny county and in Western
Pennsylvania, which has resulted in
an inﬂux of calls and letters asking
for University men to fill responsible
positions in substantial ﬁrms.

More calls and letters have been re-
ceived by the bureau , in the last
month as a. result of this campaign,
says Mr. Barton, than have been re-
ceived in any one month since the
bureau’s inception in October, 1933.

Positions are going begging be-
cause sufficient _alu1iini are not
aware that the bureau may be able to
offer assistance in securing einploy-
ment, adds the director. These jobs
are qualiﬁed positions calling for past
experience

All men who graduate this morning
or who expect to graduate in .Iuiie
are requested to place their applica-
tions with the Placement bureau as
soon as possible. All alumni are
also urged to register with the hu-
reau.

Since the reorganization of the

May Attend Classes ;

Seniors
Without Cost Or Credit
If Interest Warrants

Constitution Revised

If the demand for such a priv-
ilege warrants, seniors carrying
12 or more credits will be per-
mitted to attend any under-
graduate University course.

Deans of all schools, John
Weber, business manager, and
John G. Quick, registrar, have
tentatively approved the plan,
which was originally adopted
by SFA’s Executive committee
upon suggestion of Jules Green,
C35.

From today until next Thurs-
day afternoon, any senior inter-
, ested may submit to the regis-
itrar a card on which is listed
his name, school, and the course
or courses which he would like
to audit. According to Mr.
Quick, both the department and
the course number should be
mentioned in each instance.

The information thus gather-
ed will be tabulated and used
by the deans in determining
their final policy.

\

The first showing at the new Uni-
versity Newsreel tlieater will begin
next. Wednesday morning at 10:30
o’c’iock, the University Assembly de-
cided atpits monthly meeting Tuesday.

l:‘ive'coiiiplete progr-.=..ms of approxi-
mately 50 minutes each will be pre-
sented at the Schenley theater each
week. News, travel, and educational
lilmswill be included. Admission
price will be ten cents.

Changes in the SFA constitution
were also approved at the Tuesday
session. Chief among the revisions is
Dl‘O]_)Ol‘i'.lOll8.l representation of women
in both the Assembly and the Execu-
tive committee. Under the new sys-
tem, which must still be passed by a
lvlarcli. meet-
ing, ten undergradiiate women will be
elected to future Assemblies, and two
will be chosen for succeeding Execu-
tive committees.

The Executive coniiiiittee nienibcr-
ship will be increased to six students,
instead of the present five. Students
voting in the general spring election
will ballot. for two senior men, two
junior men, and one woman from
each of the two hi_e,'hest. classes.

Deﬁnite. procedure for filling Assem-
lily and Executive coiiimittee vacan-
cies was also approved. Quorum was
set. at one more than one-half the
membership for each Assembly meet-
ing. Proposal for the election of a.
parliamentarian to check upon rules
of order was defeated.

The major controversy in the con-
stitutional changes arose in discus-
sions of voting rights. First the plan
of balloting for two men and one
woniaii in each class was defeated.
Then a motion to perniit students to
vote for ten nominees instead of six
was rejected. Upon reconsideration,
the original suggestion prevailed.

Jules Green, C35, reporting on the
Senior Spoon tradition. announced
that Miss Thyrsa Vt’. Amos, dean of
women, John G. Quick, registrar, Lois
Millikeii, C35, and Herr_vmon Maurer,
C36, ha.d been appoiiited to draw up a
ritual for the presentation. The
spoon, he said, will be given to the
outstanding junior at the M-5-._v Tap
day exercises. "

According to George Roll, Ed3-5,
cliairiiian of the intrai.miral sports
committee, 36 teams Iepreseiitiiig ac-
tivities, the ROTC and fraternities
are now playing basketball ﬁve days
each week on the Trees gym and
Stadiiiiii courts. He mentioned an in-
surance plan now offered, which will
eover injuries sustained during the
games.

More than 100 book exchanges have
been transacted under the ‘WSGA-
SI-‘A systenusaid Roberta Nern, C36.
The exchange, which has been in op-
eration since the beginning of the
semester, will close this afternoon.

Fine Arts Head Proposes To Stage _
Series Of Artistic Motion Pictures

 

By Sydney Horovitz l

V'li:i'r. are the possibilities of the:
movie industry, the ﬁfth greatest in!
America, as an art form? j

VValt.er H. Hovey, acting head of;
the (lcpartinent of line arts, has uii-l
dertakeii-to answer this andrelativei
qiiestions with plans to stage a series,
of ﬁlms to which students will be in-3
vited tree of charge. :

“Le Cliien And.i1ou"’ and “Poil de
Carotte," the two ﬁlms selected for
the first sliowiiig, will be screened
Tuesday evening, February 26, in the
large hall. room on the sixth ﬂoor of
the. Cathedral. Philip -C..Elliott, as-
sistant professor of ﬁne arts, will give
an ex1)lanatory talk on each ﬁlm to
introduce the underlying artistic ele-
ments.

“Le Chien Andalou” is a silent pic-
ture directed by Salvador Dali, whose
painting, “Enigmatic Elements in 21
Landscape,” received honorable men-
tion at the Carnegie International Art
exhibition. The ﬁlm is a famous ex-
ponent of surrealist thought, a new

4

Q Liberte.”

school of art expression. Its showing
here will give students an opportunity
to see and hear what is being done by
this new school.

“Poll de Carotte,” which translated
means “the red-head.” is a French
talkie with Englisli sul3—titles.

Aiiioiig the Prencli, Russian. Ger-
niaii and American ﬁlms which are
plaiiiied for future showing are

"White Hell of Pitz Palii,” Anous’ “La
Eisenstein’s “Potemkiii,”
and “Le. E‘vl.illion” by lleiie Clair, the
faiii-ed l<‘i'ench direct.oi‘.

Mr. Elliott said, “’l?his will give stu-
dents an opportuiiity to see ﬁlms not
purely industrial and not connected
with Hollywood. It will give them a
basis of c.oznpa.risoii between ﬁlms
purely commercial. purely artistic,
and those combining both qualities.
Thus it will help in analyzing the pos-
sibilities of pure art in the movies.”

Three performances will ie held
this spring. If the project is a suc-
cess, it may be developed into an ex-
perimental la.boratory for productions
from an artistic point of view.

mittee, a total of 129 people attended.
Most of the students came with their
own fathers, but various members of

Cups! Thousands
OF ’Em . . . Gulp

If the number of drinking cups
utilized in one week is any cri-
terion, plain water is Still the
favorite drink of University stu-
dents.

Ten thousand paper cups are
needed to supply the drinking wa-
ter demand in the Cathedral of
Learning every week. These cups
are placed in the nine wash-
rooms and in the four offices that
house artificial coolers. Men con-
sume the most, according to an
anonymous but authoritative
member of the buildings and
grounds crew.

It might be added that if any-
one bothered to figure out how
many cups were used in a school
term, it would add up to approxi-
mately 350,000.

Perhaps you wonder as you

Not that this interest is useless. It‘-9

is encouraging to discover widespread
technical excellences in any field. It
is satisfying to see pictures which
have the simplicity of design and
\\'al‘ll'll'.i_l‘Of color which most of the
permanent-collection paintings lack.
But few painters seem to have any
conception of painting as a simple
and clear-cut matter of expression.
Art is still to be discussed in the bar-
barous terminology of estlietics.

Artists And Cities

There are to be found, however,-
certain undertones of eX1)l‘eSSi0ll.
Some of the artists, with varying sue-J
(395.-S, have pointed simply and direcl;-
13'. Some seem to be-unconsciously
tolerant of their own reaction to the
subjects they paint. Artists have be-
come more and more conscious of
their surroundings, conscious particu-
larly of the meanness and oppressive-
ness of buildings and cities. There
are many paintings of such subjects.
llicliard Crist’s Red House catches
atmosphere particularly well. So does
Raymond S. Simboli’s A Street in
Soho, which breaths an air of general
ugliness and futility. In it several
men are walking between two op-
pressive frame shacks before a. back-
ground of smoky factories. Edwin
Zoller is equally successful with Old
Allegheny. Ivinifred I-Iaggart carries
-representation of city atinosphere 8-
step farther and introduces persons
acting in their environment. Her
painting, Betty and Spike, is sug-
gestive of the atmosphere of some of
Joyce’s stories of “Dar, dirty Dublin.”

A school of negro-painting seems
to have sprung up over night. Samuel
_Rose11berg contributes two paintings

homes, in front of Which 8 man is
loaﬁng, a child crawling‘, 8 “f0m51T1
working. A painting of decidedly
queer merit is C. Park Fuller's Supper
Time. A pregnant colored woman
with an .,ii-responsible face sits on the

crawling inside. M1‘. Fuller sympa-
thizes in part; in part he Jests.

Representationalism

In three paintings  least there are
traces of the Grant ‘Wood—Thom:1s
Benton representationalism. Silent
Grace and Farm News, by Dorothy L.
Davids, try to show real and simple
people. Estelle Thomas has the same
aim in The Diploma. Alphonse Hirtz
in North Side Flower Market has
painted with excellent feeling._the bent
b‘ac-k of the central ﬁgure.

.NOl:__lS this all. Some of the paint-
,ings have satiric intent. There is a.
,.painting of the vulgarity of a railroad
‘excursion; there is an assembly of
‘objects in‘ Political Situation which
seems to strike out at Huey Long.
Leland Knoch has painted a water-
color of tired, bored people, jostling
about on a street car. He calls it
satirically Limousines for those who
work. I cannot omit mention of
Crist’s Discovery in Yucatan, which
catches the timeless ancient Mexican
a.t.mospl1ere. The buildiiigs are older
and more solid even than the curving,
twisting trees in the foreground. To-
gether the trees and" the A buildings
completely overshadow the puny ex-
plorers. 

A Sculptured Eve ,

The sculpture is generally excellent
in technique, but weak in expression».
In some ofthe heads one senses the
individual behind the bronze or plas-
ter, but there is little genuine feeling.
Oltrando J. Lisotto attempted a union
of method and aim in his small
bronze of a broken—down, tired-out
woman which he calls, satirically,
Eve. ‘We miss the work of Janet de
Coux. who last year contributed an
excellent stone sculpture of Savono-
role.

In the Black and White division of
the exhibit there is an unusual work-
a lithograph, I think—by Marjory C.
Glassburn, called Seven Evil Ones.
There is a tremendous vitality about
it; the faces are effectively distorted.
I am unable to suggest its signiﬁcance.

Graper Lauds Plan

All Police Departments -In County

 

. “Consolidation of all police depart-
ments in Allegheny county is probably‘
the most far-reaching suggestion ad-
vanced by the Police Research com-
mission,” said Dr- Elmer D. Graper.
professor of political science and
chairman of the commission, in com-
menting on the ‘report released this
week by that committee. “This coun-
ty-wide police system would be partly
supported by the state and subject to
inspection and supervision by the
Pennsylvania State Police,” added Dr.
Graper.

The commission in its report
charged the city police bureau with
graft and inefficiency, placing the
greater part of the responsibility on
Mayor William N. McNair. He was
reproved by the commission for his
“frequent use of the privilege to sit
as magistrate.” The report also bit-
terly referred to the Mayor's refusal
to grant the commission $5,000 to
ﬁnance thorough and systematic sur-
vey of the police bureau.

Creation of a permanent police re-
search commission by the Legislature
was urged. With extended powers,
such a commission, the report held,
would prove an effective check on
laxity in the police personnel.

Twenty-one separate suggestions
were offered by the commission. The
major recommendations included:
adoption of an intelligence test in the
Civil Service examinations for police-
men; removal of the Mayor’s power
to sit as magistrate and reduction in
the number of magistrates from eight

Perhaps you can.

To Consolidate

entire, police force; abolition of “com-
pany—pz1id” police in labor disputes.
Further recommendations were:
transfer by the state, from the motor
license fund, to the city of $1,356,000
to cover the cost of traffic policing
and planning; appointment of the
Civil Service commission by the Gov-
ernor instead of by the Mayor; elimi-
nation-of all but four police stations
with Central station to be moved up
town to a more “central” location:
reduction of the traffic‘ division and
complete reorganization of the Detec-
tive bureau; and removal of the Su-
perintendent of Po1ice’s offices from

the “political atmosphere” of City
hall.
The «Police Research commission

began its work in May, 1934, when it
was appointed by City Council. Since
then the commission has held public
hearings to receive complaints and
suggestions from labor heads, former
police executives and traffic planning
committees. One hearing was con-
ducted to investigate the ﬁring by the
Mayor of one of his police superin-
tendents, and another with Major
Lynn G. Adams, superintendent of
the Pennsylvania State Police.

Thousands of interviews by indi-
vidual members of the commission
were held with policemen, police
heads, private citizens, and “even
racketeers,” added Dr. Graper.

The commission included the fol-
lowing members: Anna B. Heldman,
Patrick T. Fagan, Dr. A. I. W'ise.
James N. Hoey, Attorney Dennis Mill-
vihill, the commision consel, and Dr.

Clark Refuses

Flaming Torch ,
Of Excolumnisti

By Wilbur D. Clark

1 want to take this opportunit_v to
thank a Mr. Pearlman, a person who,
I have learned last seniester from
l.ime to time wrote learned 2-.llego1'ies
forecasting the inevitable destruction
of our capitalistic system, for his pos-
sibly well-meant generosity in offer-
ing to toss to me the torch which
after the ﬂickering fashion of danc-
ing ﬂames illuminated his way.

I am able to pardon the oxymoron,
but it is only with agreat deal of dif-
ﬁculty that I can forgive the insinua-
tion that I am a potential to1'cl1bear-
er.
torches do not appeal to me. And in
spite of any glamour that may be at-
tached to this business of waving red
ﬂags and torches from atop piles of
soap boxes, I'd still much rather bake
a cake or kiss a -blonde.

I ‘see it _now; I never should have
let,;my_ liaii-‘get so long. That possi-
bly" was the reason for Pearlinan’s
gross error. I must see my barber
more often; possibly twice a year
when I see my dentist. To be mis-
taken for a violinist is not too much
of a disgrace. but to be taken for 9.
radical or red—-it is too much.

It has always seemed to me that
while it is a good thing to realize
that this world is not perfect, and
that possibly the reason why coal
miners don’t eat much caviar is be-
cause capitalists do, that the best
thing to do about it is to learn to
get along in the present society. As
Robert VV. Service, said, there is a,
race of men that doesn’t ﬁt in. But
such men ought to be deported, or
exiled, or something. That an__imal,_
the chameleon, I think, haspthe right
idea. He changes color with his

green; on brown, he becom
etc. 
Nothing that one man says, _or be
lieves, or writes, or does is going to
gi'eatly change the existing order of
things. For that reason it has always
seemed to me that dashing about wav-
ing red flags and orating from the
top of soap boxes is ridiculous and is
so much misdirected energy. And it
is for that reason, also, that I decline
to take up the torch tossed in my di-
rection. I resent this aspersion upon
me and can only hope that I may
somehow beable to justify myself.
But I still think that it is too bad
that Pitt's model student legislative
body doesn’t show some indications
of growth intellectually.

Mr. Lloyd writes good poetry.

Some day I'm going to answer said

who seems like a great fellow, maybe,
at the time, but who quickly forgets
the freshman’s name, and soon his
face. I'm going to write about his
coming to school in the morning and
sitting through a few classes, then
taking his trolley back home again
and brooding over what a lonely place
this Pitt school is. ,

I'm maybe going to get excited
about the plight of the out-of-town
student coming here who sits by
night in his lonesome room and
thinks about the good times back in

"‘Perhaps," I might write, “if fresh-
men had customs of a sort. if they
knew who their fellow freshmen were,
if upperclassmen knew who were first

be much easier for the confused and
ignored freshman to have some fun
out of his ﬁrst couple of months.”

‘World Wa nts
Courage’-—Hough

Theologian Addressing Inquiry
Stresses Modern Frustration

“The thing the world needs most
today is courage, and the thing which

3 it suffers most from is cowardice,” de-

clar-ed Dr. Lynn H. Hough, dean of
Drew Theological seminary in his dis-
cussion of the manner in which the
world faces its problems at the week-
ly meeting of lnquiry in Heinz House,
Wednesday.

“We have come to a period,” he said.
“\Vhen the people in American colleges
are inoi"e displeased with intellectual
dishonesty than they were at any
other time in our history. Despite
this fact, there is a sense of futility,
of utter ignorance about life's mean-
ing which is prominent not only on
the fringes of society but in the intel-
lectual centers as well.”

‘ Regarding the attitude of the Amer-
ican college graduate, Dr. Hough said:
“Today there. are more college stu-
dents confronting the future with at
desperate honesty and seeking to ﬁnd
some meaning in life than in former
times. This is 21 new view for Amer-
ica which has always been a leader in
optimism.

“The reason for this is that college
students now have to face a problem
similar to that of ‘the little old woman
who lived in the shoe." There is a
sense of frustration which comes to
the student, when after exerting his
best efforts for four years. he goes
forth into the world with the first two
letters of the alphabet burdening his
shoulders, and it can do nothing for
liini.

.“_I am discovering in these days of
hardship there is something in the
human spirit that is unconquerable,
and that rises to meet the problems
which it must face. To me the reve-
lation of this spirit is wonderful.”

Annual Pitt Indoor Track Championships Set For Tomorrow
Cars Travel To South Bend V

 

Varsity, Freshmen Runners
Out To Break Old Records

Meet Gets Under Way At 1:15 0’clock In Track I-Iousegi

Large Number Of Novice Runners Entered

The ﬁnest array of track and ﬁeld competitors to represent the
lTniversit_v in recent years completed their workouts today prepara-
tory to tl1e enactment of a cinder drama, entitled “'l‘he Third Annual
Indoor Track And Field Cllampionships,” scheduled to open for an
afternoon engagement. to1no,rrow afternoon at tl1e Pitt ﬁeld house.

From 1:15 o’clock, at which time the pole-vault and high jump
routines will be dramatized, until the curtain comes down sometime.

later on in the afternoon at the com-9

pletion of the hop, step, and jump
event, the stage will be packed with
all the drama associated with a good
old-fashioned melodrama.

In all there will beatotal of 28 acts,
featuring in that number three special
faculty events with such celebrities as
J. G. Quick, registrar, Stanton Bal-
four, Dr. Omar C. Held, Dr. Russell
Ferguson, Dale Schroedal, and Carl
.Distell1orst playing the leading roles.

Registrar Quick will attempt to set-
tle an old score with Mr. Balfour re-
garding who is the faster runner by
engaging in a three-quarter lap
sprint. Drs. Held and Ferguson, both
former college athletes, will make an
honest effort to show the younger
lads how the 35-pound weight should
be tossed. Schroedal and Distelhorst
will give a good accounting for the
4300-yard run for which production
they have been practicing for the last
few weeks.

There’Il Be A Meet, Too

’l‘l1e other portion of the afternoon’s
entertainment will 'be concerned
mainly with a. murderous assault on
the ﬁeld house records.

Six varsity marks are in grave
danger of being erased from their
present exalted positions. The 50-yard
dash record, held currently by
Schlossberg, the one-mile run mark,
now in the possession of W'age11l1o11s-
er, the pole-vault mark, which at
present belongs to Pelucha, the two-
lap sprint. and quarter-mile records,
both of which were captured by Bill
Keller during his time at Pitt, and
the shot-put mark, held by Bonavita,
are the ones which may be topped.

Swimmers Ready
For Manhattan
Invaders Tonight

Murray And Hayes, Nationally
Known Swimming Stars,
A On Jasper Team

l‘.:Ianl1attan’s swimming squad ar-
rived in town late yesterday after-
noon for a meet with the Panther var-
sity team tomorrow night at 8 o’clock
in the Metropolitan club pool.

Coach Gus Mauch has on his Man-‘

hattan team two nationally-kiiown
swimming stars. Captain James Mur-
ray is rated high among the nation’s
breaststroke swimmers and his team
mate, John Hayes, is a distance swim-
mer equally as famous.

Coach Corr has had the entire var-
sity team practicing in the Metropoli-
tan pool for the past two days with
the hopes of accustoming his swim-
mers to the pool. Practicing in a 20-
yard tank and then meeting opponents
in a 25-yard tank is a handicap which
Corr was confronted with last week
when his team met Ohio State.

After a heavy workout VVednesda,v

"afternoon and a light drill last night

the squad has reached its peak. Last
night, the swimmers merely swam
their events and then wound up the
drill by swimming a few lengths to
limber up.

lliauch brought 12 swimmers from
Manhattan whom he hopes to see take
the P-a.nthers’ measure tomorrow
night. Included in the party are John
Bohan, Francis Brody, Edward Bren-
nan, Vvilliam Collins, John Coons,
Francis Gunnion, Richard Gaillainzl,
David Gillespie, Joseph Hayes, ‘Wal-
ter Stadleberger, and Vvilliam Mull-
vey.

lvlanhattan will probably use Col-
lins and Gunnion in the 50 and 100-
yard freestyle races, Hayes and
Gaillard in the 220 and 440-yard free-
style races. Brody is the probable
entry for the 150-yard backstroke
race, and Bohan is the probable
starter in the 200-yard breaststroke

meet an arch enemy, Notre Dame,

Out at the Notre Dame home, Coach George Keogan and the
Rambler cage team are preparing to give the Panthers a grand re-

last four games between the two
teams the Panthers have dealt out
four beatings to the Fighting Irish.
Last year at South Bend the Panthers

proceeded to toss out a seven-point A

victory over their Irish enemies, be-
fore a packed house, while this sea-
son the Cats on their own ﬂoor nosed
out the Ramlbers 26-22. It is there-
fore certain that tomorrow night Keo-
gan and his men will be aiming
for Panther hide to soften up the
sting of the four straight defeats.

Only one game has been dropped
by l\'otre Danie since the Panthers
made them lower§.their colors, and
that by one "point Ito the strong llli-_
nois outtit. Another indication of’ the
Ramblers‘ power was shown last Sat-
urday when the Notre Dalnoteani
downed ~ Northwestern, 28-26, North-
western being the team that handed
the Panthers their worst defeat of
the season. -

Both Captain Johnny Jordan and
George Ireland, who have recently
been-~.laid»-up._.with illness a11d injuries,
have improved to the extent of being
almost sure starters at the guard po-
sitions for the Irish tomorrow. A
sure bet for the center job is Marty
Peters, the Rambler three-letter man
and one of the Mid-west’s outstanding
centers. At the two forward posts,
Keogan will probably give the nod to
two newcomers on the Irish varsity
this season, Johnny Ford and Joe
O’K-ane.

For the Panthers, Ted Roderick,
whose last-minute basket spelled de-
feat for those big, bad Dukes last
week, will probably share the for-
ward positions with co-captain Skippy
Hughes, the Panthers’ individual high
scorer. High Pete Noon will be as-
signed the task of outjumping Notre
Dame's Marty Peters at the pivot
post. Claire"Cribbs, the other Pan-
ther captain,'Iiand Ross Emrick, who
incidentally "played a bang-up game
against the "Dukes before leaving on
personals, will probably take the floor

Fraternities Get
CPSF Proposals

(Continued From Page One.)
Wilkins, C35, Delta Tau Delta, CPSF
agreed unanimously to make the com-
ing rush season “as sane as possible."
The decision to limit orchestra
dances to one per house was the out-
come of a motion by ‘Ni-lls suggest-
ing the total elimination of any kind
of dances this coming week. This
motion passed, 7-5, but, on noting the
close score of the balloting, VVills
urged that it be reconsidered and de-
feated. “since it was obviously forc-
ing something on such a. large per-
centage of the fraternities.” Fo-llow—
ing his suggestion, the motion was
reconsidered and failed, and the suc-
ceeding motion to limit dances to one
ﬁnally was passed.

Three University Coeds’ Kin 
Submit Paintings To Exhibiti

Students Practice Star
Salesmanship For Art

Works Of Family

By Ruth Belle Strothers

Have you ever wondered-what it
would be like to have an artist in the
family‘? Three University coeds.
Martha Fuller, C38. Jane Robertson,
C36, and Doris Fuhs, C37, are pre-
pared to answer that question.

Ainong artists who are displaying
paintings at the Associated Artists’
exhibit at Cariiegie Institute are tlie
father, mother, and sister of these
three girls.

Students who visit the exhibit. will
be interested to know that “Mary S,"
a painting submitted by June A. Fuhs,
a sister of Doris Fuhs, a sophomore.
is a port1';;1it. of Mary Smith, C35, who
is an honorary coed captain and a
member of Delta. Delta Delta frater-
nity.

Jane Robertson, C36, will be willing
to tell anyone about the two pictures
which her mother, Jane Porter Rob-
ertson, is exhibiting, “Colorado Land-
scape,” and “ll/Iountaiii Ranch,” both
western scenes.

lllartha Fuller, :1 freshnian student,
is proud that this is the ﬁrst time
that her fatlier, C. Park Fuller. has
entered anything in the exhibit; both
entries, “Supper Time," and “Eliza
Furnaces,” were .accepted. -

Miss Fuller says that her father
never had any instruction, “He just
painted.” Since he began about four
yea-:s ago, Mr. Fuller has spent all of
his free time painting.

“‘I+‘ather would like to sell both of
his entries, but no one will buy pic-
tures froni an unknown, no matter
how good he may be. I want people
to know about him,” said Miss Fuller,
who would like to be her t'ather’s star
salesman.

“Eliza Furnaces” is a scene from
a local steel mill, and Miss Fuller be-
lieves that the picture should be
bought for the. offices of the company
president.

“l'M STUDYING TO BE AN ARCHITECT," says
Kling, '38. “My course includes structural engineering
...designing....drafting——regular classroom work. And
when I'm working on my term project, for example, try-
ing to ﬁgure complete plans and speciﬁcations, I'm at it
for hours at a time, often late into the night. Sure, it tires
me. But when I feel fatigued and can’t concentrate, I pull
out :1 Camel. And as I enjoy Camel’s ﬁne, rich ﬂavor, I
can actually feel my energy being restored. Soon I am
back at work—feeling fresh and clear. Camels are so
mild that I smoke them all the time, and they don’t

ever bother my nerves.”
