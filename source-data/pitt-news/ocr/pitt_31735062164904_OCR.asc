VOLUME  NUMBER 99

Board Member Calls h

For Litchfield’s Ouster;

Claims Mismana gement

Emil E. Narick, a member '
of the Board of Trustees for
the past six years, called for
the resignation of Chancel-
lor Edward H. Litchﬁeld at
a press conference ‘Friday.

Reading a letter to the
Board, Narrick based his at-
tack on the Chancellor’s ad-

ministration on the fact that '

“the University has lost the
conﬁdence of a substantial

“W ‘W? ww-

5 :

mm. 1%; NARICK
“Litchfield should resign”
segment of the individuals and

1 groups. . . that it generally looks

to and relies upon for support.”

a Speaking for Board Chairman
Gwilym Price who was not avail-
able for comment, Trustee Frank
R. Denton said, “Mr. Narick
speaks only for himself and his
views do not necessarily reﬂect

,- those of the Board of Trustees.”

Narrick ﬁrst "openly criticized
Dr. Litchﬁeld’s administration in
a letter which he read before the
Board at" its May 11 meeting. At
that time he accused the Chan-
cellor of “mismanagement” and

'said it was “incredible” that the

trustees .had not discovered the
ﬁnancial situation earlier. He did
not speciﬁcally call for Dr. Litch-
ﬁeld’s resignation, however.

In Friday's letter, Narick stress-
ed that “the University, as re-
lates to its prestige and reputa-
tion,” must be the prime concern
of those in decision making ca-
pacities. “If any individual or
groups of individuals, whether
they be trustees, administration,
etc., must be sacriﬁced to restore
the ﬁnancial integrity of and con-
ﬁdence in the University, so be
it." —

Based on these considerations,
Narick felt that “this is a time
for a change in management and
and leadership of the University.”

Narick blamed the administra-
tion for the ﬁscal difficulties. He
said -that “the administration
knew or should have known of
the developing-' crisis long before
the trustees were compelled to
uncover it themselves. If the ad-
ministration was aware of the
unfavorable ﬁnancial condition.”
he continued, “it had the respon-
sibility of ‘bluntly and forthright-
ly presenting the information to
the trustees,” along with sug-
gested remedies. Narick felt sure
that if the trustees had been
fully informed of the ﬁnancial

conditipn they “'.9!!1.‘1,.:11’W° -been.

able to take appropriate action. "S
Because of the administration’s
poor management and the con-
sequent loss in ‘conﬁdence, Narick
said, “We (the trustees) must act
to restore the integrity .and con-
ﬁdence of the University in- the
eyes of those relevant groups
which are desperately needed
and -which are absolutely essen-
tial in coping with our long-
range ﬁnancial problems.”

Narick pointed out that there.
could be noedoubt that the admin-
istration places “the University’s
future and its integrity as an

_ entity above their own personal

self-interest. They are aware,” he
continued, “that the University»
has been put on notice by the
state and private donors that un-
less the management of the‘Un€-
versity is corrected forthwith.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Eric Stern Speaks
OnSpringActiVities

By ALEX D’IPPOLITO

Student Government‘ (SG)
President Eric Stern, in
analysis of himself, SG, and
the , University, explained
his and Student ' Govern-
ment's positions on the hap-
penings at the University
during the last two months.

 
   

 

ERIC STERN
S G President

Stern, who was in Pitts-
burgh Monday, said he was “very
concerned about what has been
happening at the University —
particularly about the odd disap-
pearance of Dr. Litchﬁeld.” _

Since recent statements from
Trustees Frank Denton and’Emil
E. Narick were highly critical
of the Chancellor, Stern felt that
“the nature of the situation has
changed.” “My respect for him
(Chancellor Litchﬁeld) in the
last few months has increased,"
he said. “He has made errors,”
Stern said, “but he has also done
much for the University.

Stern said he was “deﬁnitely”
in favor of the Students for Litch-
ﬁeld movement. .

Dr. Litchﬁeld, Stern felt, could
have gotten himself out of trou-
ble, but at the expense of the
University and academic ‘freedom

‘both for the student .and faculty.

‘ Stern referred to recent criti-
cism of the role the University
has been playing with the Viet-

F am Eastern Specialist at Midday

Foreign Correspondent Speaks I

Paul Grimes, assistant to
the foreign news editor cf

‘the New York Times, will
speak at a Coffee’ Hour this _

afternoon at 3 in the SU
Lower Lounge. The topic of
his noon talk at the Midday Lec-

_ture in the Supper Room was

“The News—Fact or ,Fiction?”,
Grimes, a specialist on the,Far

‘East, was the Times’ chief cor-

respondent ‘in South Asia, with
headquarters ' in New Delhi. He

‘was responsible for coverage of '
news'from India, Pakistan, Cey- _

lon, Afghanistan, and Nepal.
Prior to his work for the Times, ,

_Grimes«was ‘an "information offi-
 cer ‘ for

headed the USIS Office in Hyder-
abad,’ central India.

Grimes’ professional’ journalis-
tic career began in Decatur Illi-
nois, and includes positions since
then in Beaumont, Texas; Kan-
sas City, Missouri; ‘ and Provi-.
de.nce,_ Rhode Island. During all
that time his special interest was
in Asian affairs.

A frequent contributor to the
New York Times Magazine, Grimes
has also written a pamphlet en-
titled‘ “India: 15 Years of Free-
dom."

Grimes is presently a consul-
tant to the Council, on Foreign
Reltaions, andka pmember , of the '
Overseas Press Club of America. .
He is also .,on,.’the faculties

“Some people would prefer
Pitt as a white collar vocational
school to train junior executives,"
he charged. Although he said he
had -nothing against “training
people to" earn a -living” Stern
criticized the “anti-intelectualism”
of alumni and area residents who
should be helping the University..

' but are not. V 9
Stem cited the letter in Wednes-

day's Pitt News by an anonymous

alumnus who felt that the Uni- 

versity was hiring and turning
out subversive elements. That
“professors question the validity
of their academic areas and stu-
dents question values” is what
Stern felt should be the idea be-

-hind a_ University.

In response to criticism of SG
and his own inactivity this term,
Stern said thatthe historical role
of SG in the summer is merely
to handle “custodial functions.”
Sincebmany students, faculty and

. SG senators are not on campus

during the spring term, no policy
decisions are made. '

In answer to Wednesday's Pitt
News editorial ‘The Missing Link"
which called Stern to task for
not saying or doing anything ‘on
any matter of concern‘ to the
University, Stern said, “It was
right, frankly. I should have done
something.”

Stern had not done anything

partly because of the role of SG
in the summer,<partly because he
was not completely informed on
any issue, and partly because he
has been working full-time in
Cleveland. _
. “Student Government certain-
ly intends to do things in the
fall,” hesaid. In the future, he
added, SG should be more active
in the ‘spring term because “too
much happens” for it to‘ be in-
active. *

Rally Leaders Believe   it  
 Missi-on Accomplished  

Last week’s rally in sup-
port of Chancellor Edward
H. Litchfield “achieved our
purposes as they were ex-
plained then,” according to
Donald Friedman, under-
graduate spokesman for Stu.
dents for Litchfield.

The purpose of the rally

was to demonstrate student sup-

port of the Chancellor _and to"

create positive publicity for the
University.

Except for the continued cir-

culation of the petition support-
ing Dr. Litchﬁeld, and the letter-
writing campaigrl9‘urged at the
rally, no further action is plan-
ned. f‘To rehash the same issues

' would be useless and would not

draw the support that we re-
ceived the ﬁrst time,” said Fried-
man. ‘ ‘

. - Friedman acknowledged. that
“i the situation? chances-.or-ldevél-..

     
  

    
   
   
   

must act, we will do so. Until
then, however, we do not see any?
need for _further action.” >

The petition, which now" has\
over 1,000 signatures, is still, 
ing circulated, primarily among;
evening ' students. A small ‘dele-
gation of students had wanted to5
take the petition to Dr. ‘Litch-
ﬁeld at his Potter County farm
last Friday, but the .Chancellor‘_s'
doctors did not permit him to
any visitors. They are hoping t "
take the petition to him Saturday,
although ﬁnal‘ arrangements have
not yet been made for the trips;

How do the people of a
Latin American nation react
to United States interven-
_tion in the Dominican Re-

 public in the midst of that

nation’s political crisis? Re-

cently the University’s soci-

ology research department
interviewed 1200 Colombian
citizens to gauge the effect
of U.S. intervention.»

Most of the population of Col-
ombia supported U. S. involve-
ment. The 200 “elites,” or upper
class members who were inter-
viewed were opposed. Colombian
university students were violent-
ly against U.S. intervention.

The students were also ex-
tremely opposed to Colombian
participation in an inter-Ameri-
canpeace force. The elites were
less in favor of Colombian. in-
volvement than the general pop-
ulace, who supported an Organi-
zation of American states (OAS)
force.

All strata of the Colombian
people thought that Communists
had been involved in the revolu-
tion.

A native organization, Nation-
-al Research of Colombia, was
sub-contracted to interview the
populace. Dr. Jiri Nehnevajsa,
chairman of the sociology de-
partment, explained, “There is
no reason to set up competing in-
terviewing facilities in Colombia
if good ones already exist-ones
that we have conﬁdence in.

Other questions dealt with the

type of,.lan.d=.-neform expected by -

1970; the kinds of educational
programs which would help the

'_ country; the type of political sys-

tems considered the most and

least effective; and the likelihood
of a revolution in the near fu-
ture. ‘

Results of this survey have
been compiled in a 570 page fold-
er entitled “Images of Colombia.
1970.” The study was in conjunc-
tion with the Special Operations
Office of the American Univer-
sity. I

University students and gov-
ernment officials in ten countries
of the world‘ were asked their
opinion on the future of the cold
war in another research depart-
ment project. These people were
asked what they expected the
United States, Russia, and Com-
munist China to achieve in world-
wide inﬂuence, what goals these
powers might have, and how
these goals might be carried out.

Another recent study involved
1,500 Americans, who were inter-
viewed on their attitudes about
the cold war, disarmament, and
the government civil defense
(CD) program.

_“Civil Defense and Cold War
Attitudes” is the title of the 609
page study made for the Office of
Civil Defense and the Secretary
of the Army.

Interviewers asked a sample
of U.S. citizens such questions as:
“Have, you ever talked about us-
ing a public fallout shelter with
anyone in your family?” “How
much do you worry about the
possibility of a nuclear attack?”
“Which cities should have .anti-
missile defense if only seven
cities could be defended?”

Disarmament was also an im-
portant feature of these surveys.
Interviewees were asked to eval-
uate the effect of anti-missile de-
fenses on chances for world-wide
disarmament, the probable in-
crease in cold war tensions in the
next ten years, and the over-all
chances for world peace.

University Y Corps Project
To Benefit Underprivileged

The University Y Corps is
experimenting this summer
with teams of college and
high school students who
work with young people in
low ‘income areas of the city.

The project was designed
with. a four-fold purpose: 1)
to give college ,and high
school students a chance to have
a ﬁrst hand examination of so-
cial problems; 2) to further rela-
tions between college students
and high school students; 3) to
give the members of the Corps
direct contact with youngsters
from low income area, and- 4)
to teach the children in the dis‘-

‘advantaged neighborhoods ‘cer-

tain skills.
Work with the children has

' been divided into three different

areas. There is the ‘fmental” area
where the emphasis is on read-
ing and some tutorial-study proj-
ects; the recreational area — (in-
cluding development of sports-
manship); and the service area
(neighborhood clean up).
Typical activities of the Corps
include development of arts and

V Because of “the administra-
tion’s sincere desire to help over-
come the University’s ﬁnancial
difficulties,” Narick concluded
that “the .administration itself

should and will initiate the rec-

ommendation to the trustees that

a change in management and»

leadership is imperative at the
earliest possible date.”

Narick graduated from the Uni- ‘

versity in 1940. While here he
was on the football team, a mem-
ber of Delta Tau Delta social
fraternity, and was tapped into

' orary leadership" fraternity. He

tees as an alumni trustee in
1959, and reelected as a term
trustee in 1962. His term expires
July 31, and he is-not eligible for
reelection. .

While serving on the Board he
was a member of the Audit Com-
mittee, which was replaced in
1964 by the Budget-Audit Com-
mittee. Narick felt that the effec-
tiveness of the Audit Committee
was lessened by the absence of
any bankers on the Committee.
despite the fact that a number
of prominent bankers were then

on the Board.

Narick said he was delighted
with the Students for Litchﬁeld
rally held July 13. He felt that
it would “draw out the facts of
the situation, demand informa-
tion, and cause action.” _

?You are Bill DelVecchio,
the best sprinter in Western
Pennsylvania and one of the
best in the nation. Now
you’ve reached that impasse
which befalls all college run-
ners—your eligibility has ex-
pired. What do you. do?

DelVecchio feels he has solved B

that problem. He . simply plans
,to advertise himself. If there is
a track meet around, DelVecchio
will be available. .
There is about as much future
for trackmen graduating from
college as there is for U.S.-Army
privates being shipped to Viet-
nam. No one is more aware of it

-than DelVecchio. “You can count"

the great runners in the country
on one hand, and I don't pretend
to be a great one,” said Del-
Vecchio. *

“But running is a part "of my
personality, and one which I
‘don't want to relinquish right
now. There’s only one way to
Succeed in this sport and that’s
to love every minute of it.”

DelVecchio does love it. You
could see that when Coach Carl

Rees asked him to switch from I

the 60-yard dash indoors to the
600-yard run. Although he knew
it would hurt his training for
the outdoor’ sprints, DelVecchio
agreed to make the switch and
went right into training for his
new event. ' _
At ‘the new distance, he set a
new record and ﬁnished fourth in
the IC4A meet at Madison Square
Garden. The IC4A meet pitted
him against men who had been
running the event_ for two and
three years." , , , p
' DelVecchio is lthatﬂkind‘ of a
competitor. Looking over his rec-

- ord for the high points, there

are so many that the job becomes

impossible. As a Sophomore, Del-'

Vecchio won both the 100 and
200 events at the Centnal Col-
legiate meet, placed in -both
events in the NCAA meet, and
ran a dead heat with the nation's
hest 220 ma.n,'Henry Carr.

he excelled. Again, it’s impossi-

_ In the Morgantown quadrangu-

Virginia, and Syracuse, he ran a
total of six races, winning four,
running ‘a strong leg on the 440-
relay team, and finishing with a
46.2 in his leg of the quarter-
mile relay. _
DelVecchio is loaded with two
things which make a good ath-
lete. He has the natural ability

and the necessary desire. “I ,

think natural speed ‘is most im-

“but strength is also very impor-

Sweetmeats

Lead Series p
In IM Loop

Defense-minded NIBA Sweet-
meats defend their Intramural
Softball League title today at 4:30
p.m. at Trees Field. The Sweet-
meats play the winner of Tues-
day’s game between the Counse-
lors and Dents.

The Sweetmeats had an unde-
feated (6-0) regular season and
have already won two games in
the double elimination playoff-
series. Both of their possible op-
ponents have lost one game, and
an MBA victory today would give
them the title. If they lose, the
playoffs will continue.

Centerﬁelder Bill Headley has
led the team’s hitting, starching
all pitchers with line drive hits.
Headley recently started in a
game for Pittsburgh Pirates pros-
pects, but decided to forgo .a
baseball career since the Pirates
are loaded with young outﬁelders.

In the playoffs, the ﬁrst-seed-
ed MBAS have beaten the Re-

. jects and the Counselors. They

took the lead against the Counse-
lors when Shanafelt doubled, ad-
vanced to third on an error, and
scored on a sacriﬁce fly by
Headley. ,

Defense, however, has been the
team’s biggest asset. The Counse-
lors struck back with‘ three
straight hits against MBA pitch-
er Al Grigalunas. Headley then
threw out the Counselor’s Joe
Friend, who was advancing to
second on a single by catcher
Nick Berry. The rally was squelch-
ed, and the MBAs won, 3-0.

Another MBA team, the MBA
Rejects, eliminated Phi Lambda
Phi, 11-10-, in-the semi-finals. The
last place Rejects were then elim-
inated, 10-8, by the Dents. The
Dents also defeated Circle K, 6-4,
earning their berth against the
Counselors.

 5 A conservatory is a place
.'for. instruction’ in the arts.
‘The Pittsburgh Playhouse
and the Ca-rnege Institute of
Technology have devised
and are sponsoring a con-
servatory for theatre. The
"concept. for their American
‘Conservatory Theatre (ACT)
is two-fold: to have a res_i-'
ident repertory company and
to’-have continuous training,
"study, and practice in theatre.
The members of the ACT com-
pany _ will participate in both
—-activities: performing and study-
 ing in theatre.

 The city of Pittsburgh is for-
tunate that it is. getting ACT,

honipanies in the U. S. During
ACT’s ﬁrst season, audiences will
-see 12 plays. Four are to open
in the next ten days. Two differ-
-ent plays will be performed each
night. -
0‘ Will this new concept in the-
atre survive? An answer to this
question can'only be considered
if one looks at the results. Thus
vfar, only one show has opened,
and it is a smashing success. Ar-
~."tist_ic Director Joseph/Ball direct-
ed the ﬁrst production, Moliere’s
Tartutfe. Ball’s Tartuffe is full of
life. With the use of a versatile
cast, Ball has given Moliere the
‘necessary zest that audiences to-
A day appreciate and desire.
'.«_"Rene Auberjonois as Tartuffe,
a. reputed holy man, has insinu-
ated himself into the home of the
‘wealthy: civil"-wtar.-..hero. David
Hurst as 9_};g;un.,,,Ever.yone in. the
household, except Orgon, suspects
7-Trartuﬁe of underh,-andedness.
. Orgon is so trusting that he of-
 fers his daughter’s, Barbara Car-
uso as.Marianne, hand in marri-
.. age, and later turns over his en-
tire’ estate to Tartuife. The beau-

y Success

tiful and talented De Ann Mears
who portrays Elmire, Orgon’s
wife, has Tartuﬁe seduce her in

the presence ‘of her husband. Or-‘

gon realizes his mistakes; how-
ever, Tartuffe has the upper hand.
Tartuffe attempts to evict Orgon
and prove him a traitor.
Auberjornois is magniﬁcent .as

the sinister Tartuffe. The wicked
workings of Tartuife’s mind can

easily be read in Auberjonois’s
_poetic movements and elastic fa-
cial. expressions. '
Sada Thompson as Dorine, the
loud-mouthed servant girl who

does not know her place, gives _

the play the early boostythat puts
the show on its feet. ‘
Hurst as Organ and Robin Gam-

. mell «as Damis add a sparkle of

slapstick- The latter gives a rau-
cous footstamping performance
that brings down the house.

Will ACT survive? By all means.
