Roone_v’s queen. Five cups, three to
the winners of the Sing, and two to

“California-Bouind’

  

BOB LARU_E, sENioR,:

IN THE top part of this “C”
Bobbie La Rue, veteran Se_n-
ior halfback, is reminding B111
Daddio, sensational sophomore
end, that he’ll have to dump
that Washington tackle if Pitt
off-tackle plays are to work in
the New Year’s.c1assic. ‘ 1

In the lower base of the “C”
another Senior, this time burly
Arnold» Greene, warns Dad-
dio’s classmate, Al Lezouski,
guard, that he’ll have to get
some help if expected to dent
that Washington forward wall.
Greene,'by the way, is the fast-
ﬁnishing fullback who, after
spending three seasons in the
signal - calling department,
stepped into Stapulis’ position

when the latter was injured.’

Wc have a hunch you'll hear
plenty of both La Rue and
Greene in their ﬁnal collegiate
games. .
Ave Daniell, All-American,
tackle,lis right in the center of
things. similar to what he’ll be
doing in the Rose Bowl classic,
ending the varsity career of a
man who made good after only
indifferent success at high
school hall.

Two Mighty’ Archers $
Stalk Deer For Days

 

Hopeful Hunters Haunt Hill
For Denizen Of Wilds
With Bows, Arrows

By Ray Maclntyre

Nimrod, son of Cush, was a mighty
hunter, but it’s hard to be a mighty
hunter nowadays (especially, it would
seem, with bow and arrow) when you
can tramp over wooded hills for three
whole» days without even seeing a
deer, and in your extremity be forced
to exercise your skill on stumps and
trees and big red barns instead of the
ﬂeet-footed denizen of the wilds.

John Dambach, head of the depart-
ment of physical education; C'h31'1€5
Gongloff, graduate student and ex-
olymplc aspirant, and an off-can1P“5
friend of the two armed themselves
with bows and arrows last week and
departed for Clearﬁeld county intent
on Proving that man can still slay the
wild beast in primitive manner.

In Clearﬁeld county, snow lay 0“
the ground 11 inches deep. Deer
tracks were everywhere. _The trio
arose at five in the morning, and
hunted till six in the evening. And
hunted, and hunted, and hunted.

Both driving and still hunting were
tried. Mr. Gongloﬂ? would start_at

below for the frightened deer to ap-
pear. ‘

None appeared. _

Sometimes all three . would hide
themselves at the crossing of trails
and wait for the deer to appear.

None appeared.

In time, the trio took ‘to shooting
at trees and stumps and big red barns.
Mr. Gongloﬂ’ hit the side of a barn
and ruined an arrow.

For three days the huntsmen never
lost hope. Even then they didn’t, but
they simply had to come home some
time. And besides, Mr. Dambach had
a pair of badly chapped lips.

Says Mr. Dambach: “Deer hunting
is great sport, especially with bow
and arrow, when the deer has at least
a sporting chance. I predict that this
form of hunting will become more
and more popular.”

lResearch Bureau Indicatesl

Approach To 1929 Index

Rising to the highest point since

they reached a mark of 108 per cent
of normal, according to latest reports
of the University Bureau of Business
Research.

In addition to last week's encour-

; aging increase, the adjusted index for

the month of November rose above
normal for the first time since the
summer of 1930.

“Business here early in December,”
says the report, “was at the best lev-
els in seven years, and the outlook
for sustained activity during the early
months of 1937 at least is very en-
couraging.”

Chief factors tending to boost the
index during the past week were the
volumes of industrial production and
retail trade. Last week, industrial
‘production stood at 110 per cent of
normal. compared with 80.4 at the
same time last year and 50.8 in 1934.

P. S.——Do your jokes have whiskers on ’cm too?

Much ofithe proverbial wailing and gna-shing of teeth has been
creating quite a hubbub these days in sports circles. Sports writers
and coaches are noisily voicing their opinions on the selection of
Pitt to boot the old pigskin in the Pasadena Rose Bowl on New Year's
Day. Louisiana State, the print shrieks, is the team that should be
passing, blocking, punting, and (hopefully) touchdowning against the
heavy Washington State line out there. It is noteworthy that these
sports authorities somewhat forget the code of the sportsman--to

accept the final decision and the final score of the game and to win
or lose like gentlemen. . . 1 - « V

The principal objection seems to be that a Panther squad has lost
every time it has been Rose Bowl tripping. Well, sirs, every Panther
eleven that has lost out there in Pasadena has lost with its chin up and
kept coming back for more! A.nd’don’t look now, but here they come
again. And win or lose—by ten touchdowns or none———they’re sportsmen!

A We were indeed astonished to ireaditheifollowing headline on
the sports page of the Toronto Globe previous to the Pitt-Nebraska
combat: "PANTHERS FAVORED T0 OUTSCOVRE PITT” .
hmmmmm . . . “Sa-d c(ace),” say the cards ’round the table.

,Astonished before, we are now somewhat perturbed over my‘ new.»

that a Washington re-serve center is not permitted to go to Pasadena with
the team next week, not because of a broken leg, or absentee teeth, or
other fractured appenda.ges—-—but, of all things—-—thc hiccoughs. The gentle-
man is Mitch Mondala. Mondala is quite determined that hiccoughs or no
hiccoughs he shall be Rose Bowling on New Year’s Day, but University
physicians say no. That is what we call tough luck, We, the cards, extend
our sincere sympathies to you hiccough-stricken Husky.

To the Panther footballers we say a parting word: Up cards
and at ’em! ,

>$= :5: 

Sport Robinson ‘Deals. . .

Before signing off for the holidays, this card wants to deal out the
fact that there's an indoor track season just around the corner, and in
passing, wishes to remind all prospective Owen's, Woodruff’s, etc., that
genial Coach Carl Olson will be waiting with open arms for candidates to
report to the tra-ck house after the holidays.

This is Olson's ﬁfth year at Pitt, and the Fine record made by
his athletes during that time is a tribute to his ability as a coach.
He welcomes especially novices, boys having no track experience
whatsoever.

_The facilities for indoor track workare by no means the finest, but
creditable improvements have been made so that practically every type of
event can be handled in the ﬁeld house.

Despite the emphasis placed nowadays by writers with regard
to athletic scholarships, the various sports of the University are open
to any student wishing to try out. Track is just one of them, but
it offers a golden opportunity for a__greenhorn to earn his spurs. A
pair of legs, a normal mind, and a ﬁghting heart are the three
requisites. Olson and Pottswill take care of the rest.

"A trump of" a Christmas suggestion," says the Cards.

football was concerned.

Quint In Home Opener;
Pitt Defeats Butler

Dr. Carlson and his basket-
ball crew returned home yes-
terday -to begin preparations
for their first home game of
the season, Monday, December
211, against Wisconsin at the Stadium.

Traveling through the Midwest, the
varsity ﬁnally caught up with the pace

that‘wins and swished out their first ~

victorywof the .ye_a1t. Monday..nig_ht. at
Indianapolis when they defeated’ But-
ler University, 32-21. ‘ ‘

As typical as is a loss ‘to North-
western in the ﬁrst game of the‘Pan-
thers’ Western trip is a ‘triumph over
Butler. The record of this season’s
excursion is almost identical with that
of the last three years, defeat by
Northwestern ‘and victory over But-
ler. -.

Confronted with the third game in
four days, Dr. Carlson started his re-
serves in the Bulldog game. They
jumped to a six-point lead at the very
outset of play and maintained that
lead throughout the evening. The
half—time score was 13-10, advantage
Pitt. ' ~ 1

Strapping Joe Garcia, ,Pitt’s six-

points for the game’s high score. Gar-

this latter stage of the game that the
Panthers tallied the determining
points of the contest. H

OrganMusic To Mark , smorgasbord!

  End Of Class Periodsl

Public Address Outlets In Cathedral Rooms May Provide
Ten Minute Recital Originating From Instrument
Recently Installed In Studio On 23rd Floor

By Harrison Chandler

And now organ music, following
the recent installation of chimes, will
peal forth from the public address
system outlets in the Cathedral class-
rooms. ’

The music will originate from_ 3.
Hammond electric organ, recently in-
stalled on the 23rd floor.

University officials, not content to
stop. with the chimes system, in itself
a revolutionary method in American
university buildings for signaling the
beginning and ending of class hours,
decided the system could carry other
sounds as well.

Chancellor. John G. Bowman and
John Weber, University business
manager, listened tokan impromptu

Ceiling Of Commons Room
To Be Finished During
Christmas Recess

 

With the wood-supporting frame-
work already »-partially construc'ted,
s-to-nesetters are expected to begin

' building. the, lofty arched ceiling of

the C.atl1ed,ral ‘Commons Room during
the Christmas holidays.

When -students return January 4,
portions of the ceiling will be com-

- plated, according. to A». A-. Klimchecfk.

University architect. After the walls
in the first ﬂoor elevator lobby have
been completed, work on the ceiling
will begin.

By that time stonesetters will also
be constructing the walls connecting
the ﬁrst ﬂoor elevator lobby with the
Fifth and Forbes s'treet entrances.
Two entrances on the Bigelow boule-
vard side of the Cathedral will be 11]
use beginning early in January. A
new revolving door arrived this week
and is being installed in the new en-
trance.

In addition, the terra cotta tile
walls of the ground floor elevator lob-
by will be completed, Mr. Klimcheck
added. The plaster ceilings of the
ground floor corridors will not be ﬁn-
ished for some time yet, since i't is
believed that the continued construc-
tion activity there would soon have
them prematurely soiled.

In the new chapel workmen are
rapidly completing the installation of
the center stained glass window of
the chancel, designed to be-. the domi-
nating notc in the chancel grcuip of
live windows. Further shipmciits of
glass are expected. regularly, accord-
ing to Mr. Klimcheck, so that work
on the windows can be continued.

bined News and Pantherfctaffe will
be held in the News office, Room

srecital of the organ Monday. While it

has not been deﬁnitely decided to
purchase the organ, some details con-
cerned with its use have to be worked
out and a decision is expected within
the next few weeks.

The Hammond organ is one with-
out any pipes. Its console produces
no sound and when opened from the
back resembles, with its tubes and
intricate wiring, a modern radio.

Instead of any sound mechanism,
the console has 91 metal discs or
“sound-wheels,” which rotate in a
magnetic ﬁeld, setting up minute elec-
tric pulsations. These electric im-
pulses are sent out to the speaker
units in the classrooms and from there
transformed into sound.

University" Newsies
Assist In Campaign

University newsies who peddled
papers Monday in collaboration
with the Pittsburgh Press Old
Newsboys campaign, did a good
job, according to Leroy Broder,
C38, circulation manager of the
News and director of the campus

‘ sale. Thecampaign was conducted
to raise funds for the crippled chil-
dren in the Children’s Hospital.

The total amount raised on
campus was $28.38. All of this will
go to the hospital; the Press do-
nated the papers. William Stark,
C38, was the leading newsboy, with
a total of ‘$5.84. Charles Conner,
BA39, was second, with $5.43.

Women Debaters
Prepare To Meet

V .
Team lirom Bates

Bates College women's debating
squad has scheduled the University
as a stopping place when it goes on
a 1900 mile debating tour in January.

Wednesday, January 6, two of the
three women on the squad represent-
ing the Lewiston, Maine college will
appear in a debate with two mem-
bers of the Women’s Debating Asso
ciation of the University.

Marcella Leyton, C37, and Ruth
Shapiro, C37, have been chosen to
support the negative side of the ques-
tion, “Resolved, That Congress Shall
Have the Power to ‘Regulate Maxi-
mum Hours and Minimum Wages in
Industry.” The debate will he held
at Heinz House beginning at 3:30
o’clock.

Miss Lcytoii and Miss Shapiro were
initiated recently into Delta Sig-iifia
Rho, national honorary dehating.f1"a-
ternity. The three women from Bates
are also members of Delta Sigma
Rho.

Touring Pennsylvania and Ohio the
visiting women will also debate at
Penn State. Ohio State, Ohio Wes-
leyan University. Wooster College,
Western Reserve University. and Al-
legheny College.

Although this is the first time that

a Bates team will appear in Ohio,

long trips are not new to the debat-
ers. Bates men have been around the

Christmas trees, mistletoe, holly
wreaths, and Christmas carols will all
be a part of the “Smorgasbord” to
be held by Swedish committee of the
Nationality Rooms in Room 1309..
Cathedral tomorrow night.

The “Smorgasbord” is traditional
with every Swedish family, and cor-
responds to our American buffet sup
per. Upon long tables will be laid out
cold cuts, potato salad, pickles, olives,
and other delicacies.

Before the “Smorgasbord” is served,
Carl Olson, head track coach and
assistant professor of education,

assisted by Mr. James Potts, assistant
professor of education and track, will
show slides in Room 1001, Cathedral,
on the Olympics. Both Mr. Olson and
Mr. Potts were in Berlin for the 1936
Olympics last summer.

Tickets for the affair may be pur-
chased in Room 1309, Cathedral, for
one dollar per person. The proceeds
will be used in decorating the Swedish
Room of the Cathedral.

We students in the University of
Pittsburgh who know Dr. B. J. Hovde
found deep satisfaction in the press
announcements that he was undoubt-
edly slated for the job as director of
city welfare. Our satisfaction came
not merely because of his association
with our own University nor because
of his widespread popularity on cam-
pus, but because of our knowledge
that he was quite capable of ﬁlling
such an important position.

America today is at the crossroads.
Will the government give heed to the
overwhelming election mandate of
the people that “we want to be our
brother’s keeper; we want to contin-
ue WPA jobs and relief”? It is high-
ly important to the people, therefore,
that the director of city welfare be a
man of intelligence and foresightedt
ness, a progressive like Dr. Hovde.
Nor do we feel that one church group
should have the right ‘to coerce him
out of this position because they do
not like the fact that he lent his name
to the campaign of the Pittsburgh
Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy

Is it a crime for a member of a
democratic country to aid democracy
somewhere else? But this is not at all
the issue anyhow. The issue is wheth-
er a professor of our University is to
be allowed his rights as a citizen and
permitted without hindrance to ac-
cept a city job; the issue is whether
one group shall be able to lobby him
out of this position while his friends
and students forget him.

We students should all send, and
get our friends to send, letters to
Mayor Scully commending him for his
selection of Dr. Hovde and urging
that he retain Dr. Hovde. Let us hear
again the voice of the people!

“Had I been asked to sponsor a‘ meeting for the
representation of the Spanish Rebel cause I would
have agreed to that, too."

Fundamental Premise
HIS statement embodies the highest conception of
democratic free speech, and that the man who wrote
these words should be forced to withdraw his candi(la(:y

for a/ public position is something that calls for com- 

ment. It is a reprisal for the offense of aiding in the
free expression of ideas. That the man is not intolerant
is self-evident in his words; but that those who forced

his withdrawal are, is very evident ‘from the attitude ;

taken. The action may be excused as niotix‘:-.i'.ed by an
excess of very sincere feeling, but excuse is not justifi-
cation. .«

Democracy goes on the premise that the “free circu-
lation of ideas in the great market of public opinion” is
conducive to the best interests of the public welfare
There is just no point in struggling on under a democ-
racy unless this is accepted as a fundamental premise.
The proper answer to one meeting is another meeting
—if the theory of democratic expression is to be carried
to a fruitful conclusion. Let us observe the decencies
of the system that we profess to believe in, or else deny
that we believe in it at all.

But let us not cry, Wolf! Wolf; or its modern counter-
part, Communist! Redl, unless there is fact to back up
our cry. Let us not wave stereotypes before the mob
and without calm judgment stigmatize those who pro-
fess a faith in om; highist ideals. ’

Unworthy of Them

HE ACTION that we have witnessed this past week

is not worthy of those who carried it through. They
could have, with much better grace, attacked men of
much less moral integrity and social consciousness; cer-
tainly, with greater justice. Certainly there is need in
the world today for tolerance, for un-’e J .
derstanding between faiths, between‘
peoples, and between nations. The
community has lost the services of
Dr. Hovde, a man eminently well-
qualified by temperament and "expe-
rience for the job which was offered

*

The world’s struggles close in on us
with every moment that passes, and
we have need for all the wisdom and
tolerance that we possess. Let us pre-
serve the ﬁnest ﬂowering of our,
American tradition, and attempt to;
ﬁnd a way out of our present difficul-
ties by trying to achieve a solution of
our difficulties compatible with our
ideals. The “good neighbor” attitude,
should prevail.

Good morning, madam. Yes, we

have everything your little heart def

sires. Service for the masses, that’s
our motto. I presume you are seeking
a gift for your husband? Or perhaps
your son?

=31 * >'v=

Your husband? Why, to be sure.
Had you anything particular in
mind? I beg your pardon? A mous-
tache cup? Well, of all things!

Oh, yes, to be sure, they're very
much in demand. In fact, we sell
an awful lot of them. My remark
was made merely to indicate my
surprise and delight at the nov-
elty of your gift. Indeed, I think
you are being very original in your
choice. Yes, a moustache cup.

You know, they’re quite the thing of
the hour. In fact, Esquire, I believe it
is, is featuring them this month.
There was quite a large advertise-
ment concerning them, if I remember
correctly. “A Manly Gift for a Manly
Man” they called it.

Surely, madam, I’ll be glad to
show you- the different models we

Oh no, it isn't that we have them
put away or anything. It's‘ just that
we sell them so rapidly we can't
keep our counters ﬁlled. Just this
morning I was forced to sell our

However, I can order one for you.
