ICE Delegates Alreml y in Harrisburg

For Tlrree-Day State Can ven tion

' The Pitt delegation to the In-
tercollegiate Conference on Gov-
ernment left yesterday to join the
statewide convention at Harris-
burg. Delegates from Pennsyl-
vania schools are congregating
there for the three-day, confer-
ence.

Ray Maher, chairman of the
Pitt chapter, heads the travelers.

This year all the“ departments
of the University are __represented
in the delegation in contrast with
last year when the majority _of
the group were political science
majors.’ .

One of the major projects before
the Pitt delegation is a veterans
bill. Bill Swanson and Dave
Cleland will introduce this bill
which will come out’ against the
veteran’s bonus.

Maher calls this group “one of
the strongest to have. represented
Pitt at the annual conference”.

..\.

Louis Johnston is the faculty ad-
»visor. :
Russel Sheldon, last year’s gen-'

eral assembly chairman, returns
brieﬁy to the political wars after
his graduation from Pitt in June,
1948, to oﬁicially open the assem-
bly on Friday. He is at present a
student in the Duquesne Law
School.

Maher had planned to have a
representative of the Pennsylvania
General Assembly speak to the
Pitt delegation but an extension
of the assembly session caused
cancelation of his appearance.
This. extension is also causing a
mild housing shortage for the ar-
riving delegations since all room
reservations in the Harrisburg
hotels have been canceled to make
room for the assemblymen.

Twelve committees and 25

members make up the Pitt dele-

gation. Don Ewart is assistant to
Maher and chairman of the Rules

Committee. Franklin Blackstone
and Bob Thomas composed the

Natural Resources Committee.

Constitutional Changes will be
taken care of by Bob Kaufman
and Ed Ludin. Labor and Indus-
try, John West and Bill Alexan-
der; Education, Fred Purdy and
Cora Pancereve; Local Govern-
ment, Bob Lubic and Carlton
Knox.

The Health and Welfare Com-
mittee is made up of Howard
Greenberger and Bill Blockstein;
Agriculture, Pat Holland and
Marty McMichael; State Govern-
ment, Ervin Dean and Hand Raci-
cot; Highways, Annette Kalstone
and Bob Piper; Taxes and Fi-
nance, Samer 'Rosenson; Public

Editor, The Pitt News:

I feel that Les Gallagher’s col-
umn in the April 22, 1949 issue of
the News deserves a few com-
ments—adverse, perhaps; but con-
structive, I hope.

He starts off with a superlative,
as unveriﬁable as it is sensational
—“the most bitter contested stu-
dent election ever waged .”
. . . I’m- sure that you would
not be able to get’ Independent
and Fraternity political leaders of
years gone by'to agree to that
statement.

Another bone ~ of contention is
his use of _insinuation—.a teéhni-
que as elusive and hard to pin
down‘ as a wet, frightened terrier.

__n

"I cite as an example his reference

to stuffing the ballot boxes and
payingthe vote counters as possi-
ble fraternity tactics. As: I say, this
wasn’t stated,. merely insinuated.
but it is libelous in nature and
should be backed by evidence. 2
Don Wilde is a’ fraternity man."
He is the member of Student Con-
gress in charge of Men’s Elections
and responsible for watching the
ballot boxes. I’m sure his integrity
is above the reproach of_even the
most rabid Independent. "He was

on duty _in the Commons Room all

the time voting was going on.
The vote counters were -mem-

bers of Alpha Phi Omega, a na-

tional service fraternity made up
of « former members of the Boy
Scouts of America.» They work for
a worthy causeffree of charge, if
necessary. When they are paid for

their services, they put the money

in a fund to-be used for altruistic
purposes. I feel that neither; Don
nor Alpha Phi Omega should be
directly or indirectly subjected to
this insidious type of censure.
His use of generalities also _bears
investigation. He says ‘fpoor fra-
ternity kids’-’ in a sarcastic vein.
There are plenty of ' fraternity
members who aremature respon-
sible- citizens and some ‘are’ work-
ing their way throughschool. I’m
not working now, but when I join""-
ed a fraternitybefore thelﬂwar, I’
was-going. to school 20 hours and
driving a truck 30 hours a week.

Les is usually accurate when us-
ing sport terms, but foul balls are
hit—not thrown, and it’s the um-
pire who sweeps (‘home plate——not
the players. These errors, indicate,-
I believe, that the column. was

U. S. ','Wait and See" Policy
Toward China Aired by Liu

“What America really needs is a lesson in history,” said Mr.
"James "Liu, teaching fellow in history, when asked of America’s

failure in China and the onslaught

‘He indicated that to most Americans, "the ‘Chinese Communist
‘party seems, to borrow a phrase, “A Chinese riddle wrapped in
Russian,.mystery inside a Communist enigma.” Mr. Liu related that
Americans ﬁnd, it hard to "make head or tail of a situation. which

of Com unism.

appears to them to be upsid'e¢

down,» inside out, passing rapidly
from. Confucius V to confusion’ and
from confusion to Communism.
Mr. Liu said that the official"
and see.” It is usually implied that
America may yet hope to see some

mediate -future, not through any
effort on_her own part, but pre-
sumably as a result of the failure

selves to_ stabilize the situation or
consolidate their control. ‘Such,
however, may be wishful thinking.

He added, “Communism has
grown in China not through the

the majority of Chinese do not
agree, but through exploitation of

in‘ recent ’ history, the
Chinese Communists from 1925 to

ernment_ against the war lords.
From 1935 onwards, Communists
once more supported the govern-
ment on condition of ﬁghting the
Japanese. On the other hand.‘

racies failed through negligence
to be friends of Chinese Nation-
alism as they should have been.
He declared, “America’s mis-
giving was-that she did not have
a- positive or constructive foreign
policy in China. General Mar-
sha1l’s mission in 1946 upon which
the United States tried to'_save the

situation in China. was a failure’
because it was too. late and ir-
resolute.” " ‘
Mr. Liu concluded, “The only
Way to save Chinafrom Commun-
ism is not by an Ignorant, nega-‘
tive, defensive, anti-Communism
but through positive, constructive,
counter - Communistic ‘principles
and‘to revive liberalism into def-
inite actions in order to recapture
nationalism in the Far East.”

"Mr. Liu graduated from
Yeliching University’ in Peiping,
North China. Under Japanese oc-
cupation, Mr. Liu ,was ‘engaged in
underground activities. He was
twice arrested, imprisoned and
tortured by the Japanese Army.

After V -J day, Mr. Liu taught
at Yenching University. He came
to America in March 1948, being
invited by the. Far Eastern Insti-
tute, University of 'Washington,
Seattle, as Research Associate in
the ﬁeld of modern Chinese his.-
tory. ‘Since September 1948 he

A fterSuccessfuI Western Tour

The Glee Club has returned triumphant from its first western
tour in six years. “The initial step in establishing good contacts
with the West has been a substantial one,” according to James W.
Chrissis, business manager for the Club. _

The purpose of the trip had been to pave the way for future
western tours which, the Glee Club has not had in the past few
years, This is also the ﬁrst time that the Glee Club has made two

tours in the same year. They re—¢
turned from their annual eastern
tour on Jan. 31. .

At a warm-up concert, April 20,
sponsored by the Bridgeville Col-
lege Club for the beneﬁt of play-
ground equipment, the group was
heartily received by 250 people.

Following this concert the group
travelled all night to Bowling
Green, Ohio, where an afternoon"
concert in the college auditorium
was given. Bowling Green par-
ticularly liked the Glee _Club’s
renditions of _“Russian Picnic” and
“Battle Hyrnn of the Republic,”.
and the duet team of Thompson
Leiper and ‘Mary Emma Hirsch.
The audience numbered around-
800‘. ,_ — W

The group /gave two concerts
in Chicago. Friday they sang at
the South -Shore High School to
400 people. Radio station WCAL
played host to them on Saturday
for 15 minutes. The group sang
the Alma Mater, “Hail to Pitt,’?.
“Brothers, Sing On,” and “Song'~
of the Wanderlust” over the radio.

Last Sunday the,club became
the ﬁrst visiting Glee Club to sing .
at Wooster College,- Ohio. They
sang_.in the college chapel to an

Listeners commented on the
“perfect enunciation of the group”
and “the splendid variations of
tone.” Representatives of the ra-
dio station commented that the
group blends its voices into a
“oneness.” ‘

The Glee Club enjoyed visiting

the small colleges they visited.
‘ They are now preparing for
their home concert scheduled for
May 20 at Carnegie.Hall. Student
tickets at 50 cents can be bought

been so blessed in the person of one Roger Mc-

- _ As a ballplayer Shorty has had the misfortune,
until last week, to play second base, a sack bet-

ter known in Panther circles as

This coincidence had kept the Small One out
of the headlines, which, he claims, he so richly
deserves and has so stated in a seven volume ver-

bal autobiography.

Roarin’ Roger got his- big chancelast week
against Juniata, when Barnes an-4

nounced he would be unable to
play the remainder of the season.
He slammed out a triple and two

', singles against the- Indians and

collected two more bingles against
Bethany.

The pepperpot never really had
such an opportunity to show off
these batting talents, for he walks
more often in baseball than he
did as a GI. _ '

a spring. training batting average

was issued free tickets from then

d All kidding aside, and thsiis not

current high spii-“it in the Mittmen

If you have. no plans for this summer, it would pay you (in
cash money) to look into the education-work—recreation projects
the YMCA and YWCA are sponsoring all over the U. S. and abroad.

At this critical point in the history of the world, men and
women are needed who have an understanding, from experience
as well as from books, of the social and economic forces with which

jects go to a strange city, and un-

der the supervision ofthe YMCA
and YWCA, ﬁnd jobs in industry
(not clerical). They live as a
group, usually on a nearby col-
lege campus, sharing tasks of

.cooking, cleaning, washing,_ etc.

Some evenings are devoted to
seminars with community leaders
in industry. Field trips provide an
insight into economic problems of
industrial workers, labor-manage-
ment relationships,»»minority_ prob-
lems, etc. It is an eight Week’s
experience that could prove in-
valuable in the future.
