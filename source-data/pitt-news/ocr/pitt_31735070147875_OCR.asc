cut in state funding announced
last week.

The Budget Committee of Pitt’s
Board _of Trustees meets Friday
morning, and will likely decide
Pitt’s budget and tuition rate after
a. last—minute state budget pre-
vented a decision at the full board
meeting two weeks ago.

Though Pitt ofﬁcials haven’t
given hints as to what the number

could be, it will likely be more

than 4 percent for in—state stu-
dents, as state money ismeant
to offset their tuition. Tuition at

Pennsylvania budget finalized

Mallory Grossman

News Editor‘

i Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett signed

the state’s 2011-12 budget Thursday with
minutes to spare before the midnight
deadline.

The $27.15 billion budget, which cuts

overall spending by more than $1 billion, '

passed the House Wednesday night with
a vote of 109-92 and passed in the state
Senate Tuesday afternoon. The budget
included 19 percent cuts to the appropria-
tions for Pitt and similar cuts for other
state—related universities. A
The bill passed largely without Demo-
cratic support in both legislative cham-
bers, where the Republican majority set
the agenda. Corbett pushed for no new tax
increases in the budget, which included
a statement that he would veto any Mar-
cellus Shale tax or fee that made it to his
desk. » Q

The ofﬁce of the governor said in a.

statement released Thursday night that
the new ‘budget “restores common sense
to the state spending process.”

“This reality—based budget marks a re-
turn to the Constitutional principles that
must guide Pennsylvania’s ﬁscal policy,”
Corbett said. “It spends no more than we
have and it doesn’t pretend we have more
than what we have budgeted.”

Pennsylvania faced a $4 billion deﬁcit
this year, which this year’s budget covered
with a 3 percent spending cut.

Eric Shirk, a spokesman for Corbett,
said that as with most negotiations, there
was some give and take with the budget
process.

“The voters elected Governor Corbett
to enact a ﬁscally responsible budget, on
time, without raising taxes. With this bud-

get, the governor has achieved these goals -

and has laid the foundation for Pennsyl-
vania moving forward,” Shirk said.
Mike Stoll, a spokesman for state Rep.
William Adolph, R—Delaware, said that the
budget required many difﬁcult decisions
and that the ﬁnal budget was a compro-

there was an appreciation that everyone
was able to come together to get this done
in a very difﬁcult budget year.”

Stoll said the reality waslthat the Com-
monwealth lost $3 billion in federal stimu-
lus funding, which was 10 percent of the
state’s budget. .

Many Democrats did not vote for the
general spending bill, stating that they

opposed the cuts to various state pro-

grams such as education, public welfare
and health care. '

Sen. Jay Costa, D-Forest Hills, said in
a statement that he does not supportthe
ﬁnalized budget.

“We have been calling for a state budget.

that reﬂects shared sacriﬁce and fairness
to all Pennsylvanians since March. It is
now clear that our-consistent calls fell

ardizing the quality and affordability of
our education system at all levels, pre-K

through college,” Costa, the House minor- ‘

ity leader, said.

“I was elected last November to
change the culture of state government,
and that means not only must govern- 

ment be honest, it must be fiscally re- E
sponsible,” Corbett said. ‘.‘The Sen-

ate and House join my administration
in making these standards a reality.”

One of the main programs that is facing
budget cuts is the Department of Public
Welfare, which together with the Depart-
ment of Education makes up around 70
percent of the budget, Stoll said.

Shirk said the reductions in welfare
spending are achievableby reforming the
system and rooting out iwasteand fraud

Since these twopareas receive a large
portion. of state funding, “those areas 
are going to be impacted by any dramatic
changes in the budget like we, saw this
year,” Stoll said. ‘

The two areas also received 5
the most federal stimulus money. E

Brendan Owens
For The Pitt News

 A new Pitt study suggests the old axiom
 is true; when she’s not happy, he’s not
 happy. A

The study showed that a woman’s lack

E of sleep could have a large affect on the
; relationship, whereas a man’s lack of sleep

had none. ,
Wendy Troxel, 'assistant professor of

; psychiatry, made national headlines last -
 month after completing research on mar-
3 iried couples’ sleep habits and their behav-
 iors the next day. The study was presented
 at Sleep 2011, the 25th anniversary meet-
E ing of Associated_Sleep Societies in Min‘-

neapolis. M V _‘
Troxel found that a wife’s inability to

 sleep could‘ affect the couples’ relation-
 ship, whereas a husband’s inability to sleep
1 seemed to have no impact at all. The study
 reported that the longer it took the woman
2 to fall asleep, the more likely both partners
3 were to address negative interactions with. ‘
 their spouse the next day, including feeling
3 ignored or criticized.

“Our ﬁndings show that when wives took

i longer to fall asleep, the next day they re-
§ ported lower marital functions and so did
 their husbands. We did not ﬁnd the same
3 effect for husbands,” Troxel said.

. Although the research was done on the

 University campus, no college students were
; involved. Troxel, however, speculates that

ArtrRamicone, the vice chan-
cellor for budget and controller,
said after the board’s meeting last
month that the‘ board’s decision
would likely come at the commit-
tee meeting Friday.

“We realize there are working

This year’s appropriation,
which has’ been a little less than
10 percent of Pitt’s total bud-

in Pitt’s funding in more than a
decade. The total appropriation
'— $136 million — is nearest to

‘ Pitt’s 1993 appropriation of $135

Pitt officials have not stated
what the tuition increase will be
in advance of that meeting.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
said in a statement that he felt
grateful the state cut less than
Corbett’s originally proposed
halving of Pitt’s funding would
have, but the chancellor said that
the remaining cuts are still “deep
and disproportionate.”

“Among our most fundamen-

talchallenges will be to maintain

high levels of access for students -
of modest means through tuition

rates that are as competitive as
possible and through further

investments in our programs of '

ﬁnancial aid; to- provide appro-

State student aid to increase

Since the cuts in state funding
will most likely lead to an increase
in in-state tuition, Pennsylvania
students who are eligible will be
able to receive more ﬁnancial as-
sistance through grants provided
by the Pennsylvania Higher Edu-
cation Assistance Agency.

Tim Eller, a spokesman for
the Pennsylvania Department
of Education, said that PHEAA
was allocated $380.9 million in
this year’s budget, a 2 percent
decrease from last year.

The amount allocated in the
budget will be supplemented by
a PHEAA $50 million public ser-
vice contribution, which will raise
the individual maximum grant
to $4,309. This is an increase of
$807 from last year.

Keith New, a spokesman for
PHEAA, said that the agency
reached a financial situation
strong enough this year to’ al-
low it to provide a $50 million
supplement from its earnings to

relationships.

“I would expect similar pat-
terns to emerge, though the
nature of sleeping together in
college versus a stable married
relationship is quite different,”
Troxel said. “In fact, [in] college
relationships, even good ones, the
initial stage of sleeping with an-
other human being actually takes
some getting used to. So it may be
harder to tell if it’s the quality of
the relationship affecting sleep or
the newness of it.” I

Although the study excluded
college students, Amy Monpara,
a senior in Pitt’s School of Phar-
macy, agreed with Troxel on her
opinion of college relationships,
especially judging by her own.

“I am crankier, so it does af-
fect us,” Monpara said, regarding
those instances when she gets less
sleep with her boyfriend. “I can
tell when he gets less sleep, but
I feel like it’s worse when I don’t
[get enough sleep].”

The research was conducted by
observing couples over a 10—night

period. Thirty—ﬁve couples, av— .

eraging 32 years in age, were
monitored for patterns of rest
and activity in their sleep using a
watch-sized instrument called an

actigraph, which is used to record
physical activity. .

The researchers measured
the amount of time it took to fall
asleep, total sleep time and the
number of times the participants
woke up during the night.

The participants then reported
their results on daily‘ question-
naires. They speciﬁed whether

are more expressive and com-
municative in relationships. This
might lead men to pick up more
on their wives’ irritability since
they express it more.

“Women tend to drive the
climate of the relationship, so
it makes sense that the husband
would pick up the cues from his
wife,” Troxel said.

they "had negative or positive
reactions with their signiﬁcant
others.

On average, the reports showed ,

more negative than positive inter-
actions when women had prob-
lems falling asleep. '
Troxel believes that the dispar-
ity of behavior between husbands
and wives both experiencing a
lack of sleep could be attributed
to studies showing that women

Troxel believes that this study

"should serve as an alarm for all '

couples dealing with sleep dis-
orders. -

“I think it’s a wake-up call
when we increasingly have to ﬁnd
reasons to sacriﬁce our sleep.

This is just one more reason

to show that your relationship ‘

could depend on the quality of
your sleep as well as your physical
health and mental health.” I

the state grant program.

“In keeping with our name, our
public service mission to Penn-
sylvania is to help create afford-
able education to Pennsylvania
students,” New said. .

He said that the agencycan
beneﬁt the most students by help-
ing those who are truly strug-

gling to pay for education. And v

although the agency’s decision
to increase grants was not linked
to any budget cuts, New said the
agency is “very sensitive to the
strain this [the budget cuts] plac-
es on Pennsylvania families.”
Eller said that in total, PHEAA

_ will be giving $438 million in
‘ grants to students, an amount

that is separate from any federal

g grants students may receive. All
V in-state students are eligible for

these grants, regardless of which
Pennsylvania school they are at-
tending.

The appropriations argu-
ments

Gov. Tom Corbett signed the
bill into law late Thursday night.
It allocated $136 million to Pitt as
a state-related university, down
from the $168 million’ the‘ Uni-

: versity received this year. ‘

The state Senate and House
both passed identical bills earlier
in the week that outlined the 19
percent funding cuts. The bills
passed nearly unanimously last
Tuesday, after many Democrats
reversed their position on the
appropriations, which they had
blocked the previous day.

The funding .bill for all state-
related schools required a two-
thirds majority in both chambers
and passed separate from the gen-
eral spending bill, which Corbett
also signed Thursday.

Last week, Lisa _Scullin, a
spokeswoman for Senate Minority
Leaderjay Costa, D-Forest Hills,
said that the Senate Democrats
were still trying to hold out for
more funding, but was unhope-
ful that they would get their way.
When Tuesday afternoon rolled
around, ouse Democrats had
gotten on board with the 19 per-
cent cuts. ,

G. Terry Madonna, a political.
scientist at Franklin & Marshall
College in Lancaster, explained
what made the Democrats recon-
sider the bill within a few hours.

in tuition talks  

Looks like it’s time to sell

those baseball cards -— this year,
Pitt students could have to pay as
much as $1,400 more in tuition
than last year. - .

Well, that’s if Pitt’s‘ Board of
Trustees follows the lead of Tem-
ple University, which announced
a 10 percent tuition hike last week
for in-state students after Penn-
sylvania lawmakers cut Temple’s
2011 appropriation. With many
evident parallels between Tem-
ple’s situation and Pitt’s — the
two universities have similar size,
state-related status and appro-

priation_reductions —- a tuition —

increase for Arts 8: Sciences in-
state students at Pitt on the order
of 10 percent, or $1,400, seems
like a very real possibility.‘
Whatever number comes out
of Friday’s meeting of the Board
of Trustees — which, by the way,

‘ isn’t leaking any hints — the tu-

it-ion increase will likely make

.Pitt’s classes more difficult to

afford for many Pitt students,
though enrollment will likely be
unaffected. Decisions that impact
the accessibility of_ higher edu-
cation for thousands of people
-—_ like the decision the Board
will announce Friday — should
be seen as just as universally im-
portant and relevant as decisions
that change programs.-

In that frame, it’s our belief
that signiﬁcant, faster-than-in-

flation tuition increases should .

only result after extensive public
contest. At least in.terms of edu-
cating students about its thought
process and appealing for student
input, the University has fallen
short. That’s not to say, however,
the hole cannot be filled in these
waning days.

It’s a question of Pitt’s priori-

ties.

V Last week, oureditorial peti- 
tioned the University to release ’

the parts of its budget that would
allow us to connect the $24 mil-
lion appropriation cut to a tuition

increase; but alas, we’re still »:
powerless to judge the impend- I

ing increase, as Pitt continuesto
keep its budget on lockdown. Ina
related point, there appears to be
no effort on our administrators’
parts to engage the student com-
munity in a discussion about why
tuition deserves its current ﬁgure

and how exactly appropriation ‘

cuts must lead to tuition hikes.
Always hungry for graduates

who go on to elevate the school’s ,
. reputation — and fatten its dona-

tion pool —- Pitt should visibly
care about the financial solvency
of its students. Avoiding moun-
tains of debt enables graduates
to more easily spread their wings
in the joblmarket and take the
risks that innovation requires.
Pitt should show students that

it recognizes the signiﬁcant ef— .

fects increasingtuition for all
(‘and debt burden for many) can
have on our post—graduation ﬂex-
ibility. How? By actively involving
students in the decision-making
process, or at least by educating

‘students about why a Pitt degree

will demand a bigger sacrifice
next year than it did last year.

When the University devel-

oped the Outside the Classroom
Curriculum and selected the
provost and the Honors College
dean, we saw a Pitt that genuinely
cared about student input (re-
member the surveys, discussion
sessions and comment sheets).
Pitt’s administrators shouldn’t
treat tuition decisions any dif-
ferently.I

formation, ﬁgure out the rudi-
ments of your act. If you’re go-
ing to be a bad guy, determine
what the fans like and ridicule
those things. If you can ﬁnd a
way to mock Harley-Davidsons,
the United States, guns, trucks,

East Coast Choppers, beer and ,

the American flag (“Old Glory”),
you’re on the right track. Stand
in front of a mirror and practice
a speech like this one:

“Listen up, you pumpernick-

P els! l’m here to tell you that I’m

your mental superior, and also
that the USA is terrible. Did you
hear that? The USA sucks, and
everyone in it is a nitwit! You’re
all just a bunch of mopes who
cling to "your Harley-Davidsons,
‘Old Glory’ ﬂags, guns and beer.
After you’ve watched me wipe

the floor with this gung-ho al-
coholic redneck idiot you all

love, l’m going to pull down my

trousers and make him kiss both

- cheeks of my butt right hereon

live television.”

That last line is really impor-
tant, because wrestling fans love
“angles” (i.e., storylines) where
one wrestler has to kiss another
wrestler’s butt. These challenges
can result in the predicted out-
come — the losing wrestler kiss-

es the other wrestler’s butt while _

the crowd roars its approval —— or
else an incredibly obese wrestler
kept around solely for moments
such as these can run in, save
the wrestler who is about to be
forced to kiss his victor’s butt,
and then proceed to give the vic-
tor a taste of his own medicine

‘(also causing the crowd to roar its

approval).‘In either case, the fans

get what they want and everyone P

goes home happy.

_ A good guy also has to act
like a bad guy — or at least like
a tough guy —— while still manag-
ing to stand up for beer, guns, the
USA, “Old Glory,” hunting and
more guns. In the old days, good
guys had to follow the rules and
not hit people with steel chairs or
force their vanquished opponents
to kiss their butts, but times have
changed and “antiheroes” are the
new heroes. Everyone cheats, and
the pretend “referees” ignore
this malfeasance because even

the otherwise—ingenuous fans V
know the ﬁx is in and are just.

waiting for a butt-kissinglor a big
“spot” that "involves one wrestler

nouncing table and onto _a Cadil-

interview would go as follows:
_“You know, I was hanging

yon] and tossing back a few

' cold ones when I found myself

savoring the fact that that stupid

issing makes crowd go wild

Once you’ve developed your

gimmick to the utmost, you can‘

focus on discovering a memo-
rable catchphrase. Calling people
“hockey pucks,” “turnip greens”
and “pumpernickels” is one way
to go, but if you’re looking for a
killer line, we have it on good au-
thority that our own creation —
“Hey daddy!” —— is still available.

FILM REVIEW

‘Larry. Crowne’ a timel ﬁlm

Anna Weldon

“Larry Crowne”

Starring: Tom Hanks,]ulia Rob-. _

erts . .

Director: Tom Hanks
Studio: Universal Pictures
Grade: B

As far as Tom'Hanks ﬁlms go,
“Larry_Crowne” is certainly not
“Forrest Gump.” But at least it’s
not “The Da Vinci Code.” '

“Larry Crowne,” directed and
co-written by Hanks, explores the
crisis of a modern—day American
man who is unemployed and in
debt. ' '

When Larry Crowne (Hanks)
gets called to the rest area of his
workplace on “Employee of the

Month Day,” he does not expect _
to lose his job. Having won the V
award nine times previously, the —

store clerk expects fresh acco-
lades. Instead loses his job be-
cause he doesn’t-hold a college
degree.

Larry Crowne goes after his professor Mercedes Tainot in the movie.

’_ The character has a sort‘ of

naiveté, ‘and faced with unex- -'

Larry decides his only option
is ﬁnally to acquire some form

avoid'any sort of job loss in the

FASI-IIION

Flay‘ dress-up 

every day

Natalie Bell
A£rE Editor

Asa child, I spent a lot of time in
absurd ensembles.

I’d pretend to be a queen at tea
or a superstar singing in a sold-

out show. I’d dive into sequined A

dance costumes and puffy dresses
to play the parts, and what really
made it for me — and many of my
friends — were the clothes.

A lot of my peers have lost that

imaginative spark. In the place of ‘

fanciful and daring getups, they
now rely heavily on white T-shirts
and black dresses. Not that there’s
anything wrong with these items.
Like the wheat and corn of our
diets, they’re the staples that sus-
tain our closets, and with a few ac-
cessdries sprinkled on like spices,
they can come off as completely
different time and time again. But
where’s the ﬁre, kids?

My closet has become a sort
of home for wayward, costumey
pieces. As a testament to that, I’ve
made several costumes through-
out the years without buying any-
thing new. You might not know
it to see me regularly —,I don’t

‘wear the pieces in outlandish or

inappropriate ways.

For example, I have a stork pin
about the size of a hockey puck
that stares with a red jewel eye,
and I rock it’ with total sincer-
ity. The man at theconsignment
shop where I bought it told me
he’d waited months for someone
to buy it, hoping it would go to
someone who’d appreciate it.

I I’d like to think that when we
wake up in the morning and me-
ander into our closets, we get to
decide who we’ll be that day ——
a rough—and-tumble outdoorsy
Southerner or a reserved British
schoolgirl. Too often, we let clas-
sics and safe styles dictate our
wardrobes so we come off more
like “college girl” or “guy going
to class.” ’

Maybe we should reconsider ,

how we dress. Perhaps it’s time to
get out our vintage galoshes and
our wide-brimfmed summer hats
and decide not just what we’ll look
like, but who we’ll be that day.

Recently, I went to see “Bill

,, Cunningham New York,” which

proﬁles Cunningham, the New
York Times photographer who’s
been in love with and chronicling
street fashion for decades. And,

as the ﬁlm shows, he’s not in love _

with the glamour of celebrity or
the hottest designer of the mo-
ment. This man, biking around
the Big Apple snapping shots o,_f

‘ shoes and shifts, loves the ele-

gance of a good cut and the vi-
brancy of a bright hue, regardless

‘ of who says it’s in or out.

And right there is the place
where a love of fashion should
come from: that same whimsi-
cal adoration of gaudy baubles
and ruffled petticoats that we had
as children, riﬂing through the
dress-up bin our mothers made
with outdated clothes.

I hardly remember thinking,
my navy—and-white ﬂoral frock
with the shoulder pads and lace
collar was heinously ugly because
no one told me I was supposed to
ﬁnd it unfashionable. I loved the
way the fabric draped to the ﬂoor,
the royalty of the high collar and
the shine of the pearl buttons.
There probably were a few pieces
in your costume closet that you
loved dearly too, even if you now
find them horriﬁcally tacky.

\It’s not that we should disres,
gard fashion altogether — theré’s
a nice community that comes with
trends and fads. I’m suggesting
that we get more crafty with our
ensembles —— step outside com-
fort zones and piece together out-
ﬁts with the same ﬂair we had as
children.

Something splendid happens
when you let your creative spirit
dictate your clothes — it lets you
express who you are to the world.
Or rather, who you are today. Anti.
with that comes a particular kind
of conﬁdence. Once you realize
how much you really can wear,
you’ll be bolder in your fashion
choices. ’

So, I charge you, wake up to_-‘
morrow, go into your closet and"
make a statement. Wear what you

love because you love it — even if _

it’s as faux pas as a fanny pack._ ;

ideal mate for Crowne. L
Miss Tainot’s class, along with Larry’s

i new friend Talia (Gugu Mbatha—Raw), aid

his radical transformation from an over-
zealous store team leader to a trendy,
scooter-riding student. While Miss Tainot
provides the knowledge for Crowne’s aca-

demic success, free—spirited Talia concocts 4

an image for the protagonist that makes
him look like a middle—aged hipster.

But this change is unbelievable and
overwrought, and perhaps that adds some
of the -humor to the plot.

Miss Tainot’s class acts as the initial
point of growth for both characters. The
two adults are in the midst of somewhat

tragic mid—life crises and ﬁnd ‘comfort in

each other throughout the movie.

to relate, regardless of age, with Crowne’s
struggle to gain theconﬁdence needed to

Crowne’s ﬁrst collegiate experience
is full of humor. His serious economics
professor, Dr. Matsutani (George Takei),
often takes Crowne’s cell phone during
class because of his blatant texting.

develop a well-versed speech, asks for the
course name on the ﬁrst day of class, ce-
menting his role as the classimbecile.

Though Crowne’s economic struggles
makes the movie timely, the typical aspects
of a romantic comedy ﬂourish, making the
relationships between characters cheesy.

Still, despite the pitfalls of a romantic
comedy, both Hanks and Roberts hold the
movie together with their acting talents,
making the ﬁlm enjoyable and worth see-
ing. Because of them, the movie’s less at-
tractive qualities are covered up with the
genuine humor. that each actor portrays

The ﬁnal scenes of the ﬁlm include an
off-topic speech and a closing kiss that
is common to many romantic comedies.

ALBUM REVIEW

Legs Like_Tree Trunks
Self—Released 3 ' ' '

Rocks Likei-Don Caballero, Vampire
Weekend V ' ‘ . A
Grade: B

- Legs Like Tree Trunks’ premiere album
is like the beachy lovechild of indie and
math rock.

"V The quartet’s, members —. Matt Holden,
Dave Shepherd, Tyler Donaldson and Dave
Cerminara -— are all_Pitt students. '

. Their eponymous debut album begins

' with the incongrous “Pushover.” The in-
strumental features bouncy, quick guitar
lines and a charging math—rock style, yet
singer Holden’s vocals feel pained, tinged
with a wounded whine. The track hits you
in the gut in a way that holds your atten-
tion. . ' V ‘ .

p The following song,"‘A-nnabel,” mean-
while, has a happier mood. With a nice,

smooth, calculated sound akin to Don
'Caballero’s and Band.of Horses’ ajnd with
more upbeat vocals, it lacks the defeated

sound that permeates “Pushover.”

Songs like “Dick Whitman” move away
from math rock and into more of a slow
indie vibe. Sometimes this pace can feel a
little plodding, but the drowsy guitars and
coarse vocals keep thellistener hooked.
Holden’s voice variesjffrom the painful
moan to a charming pjurr; it mixes the
low, hollow sound ofjohn Mayer with the
pain and disenchantment of Ian Curtis to
create a peculiar blend}

The most impressiviething about this

album itscreators’ attention"-to detail: '

The smallest aspects, such as the chim-
ing percussion in _“Winter,” add that ex-
tra “oomph’f to the tone’ and mood of the
song$,._Many_bands\ foiggetv that the little de-
tailsvare‘ like extra spices that molv'ei's‘o ngs
' from good to greatfibut Legs Like Tree
Trunks has kept this inmind. The guitar
lines are impossibly intricate, forming an
auditory spiderweb ofpﬁthe minutest de-
tail. The complexities niake the music feel
fuller_without making it too crammed.
With just six track,s,f the EP is unfor-
tunately short, clocking in at just over 22
minutes. But the members of Legs Like
jTree'- Trunks manage ti) squeeze sweet
‘math rock goodness into every’ note.I

ALBUM REVlEW

Nadler farfrom Bjork  

Liz Keeney
. Staﬁ'Writer
Marissa Nadler
Marissa Nadler
Box of Cedar Records
Grade: B- -

Rocks Like: Kate Bush, Joni Mitchell

Singer-songwriter Marissa Nadler’s epony-
mous ﬁfth album is a beautiﬁilly melancholy
affair, but it teeters on the edge of melodra-
matic.

Completely fan—funded after a successful
campaign through Kickstarter, a site through
which users ﬁnance artists’ various creative en-
deavours, the album continues Nadler’s streak
of dreamy and creepy songwriting.

The album is so perfect for an afternoon
spent reading at a coffee shop that you can
practically hear the beans grinding and the
milk steaming in the background. V

Sounding like anupdated version of a Kate
Bush release — only without the lyrical allu-
sions to “Wuthering Heights” and fog—ﬁlled
music videos —— Nadler’s new album lets her
haunting voice be the center of attention. The
instrumental arrangements complement the
vocals without overshadowing them, allowing
Nadler’s real strength — her ability to con-

vey heartfelt emotion through her voice —— to

. shine.

Standout tracks from the album include
“Alabaster Queen” and 5‘Daisy, Where Did You
G0?” which showcase the singer’s range and
power. At its best, her voice is sirnultaneousl
haunting, dreamy and hopeful —- bringing to
mind mythological sirens drawing their vic-
tims in with song. However, on some _tracks,
the vocals come across as a little silly, almost
as though Nadler is trying too hard to distin-
guish herselffrom stereotypical female singer-

songwriters in the vein of P] Harvey or Ingrid .

Michaelson.

Instead of a folksy, guitar-heavy allure, Na- A
_ dler relies more on the strangeness of her style,

like her high pitched Voice, bringing willing
listeners into her world. But she keeps skep-
tics ﬁrmly rooted in this one with a seemingly
off-putting quality. While that works for some
— Bjork, for instance — Nadler isn’t quite
interesting enough to completely pull it off.
Likewise, her lyrics range from poetic to
pretentious, like in “Alabaster Queen” when
said sings, “When I hear you play / I think of
water ‘and sunshine / and I never really mind
/ all your women wistﬁil wanting / you all the
time.” Drawing from American Gothic tradi-

' tions, her lyrics tell stories of forgotten times

and wistful dreams that occasionally come
across as a little too romanticj

a show at the Greentree SportsPlex
Wednesdaynight while the past

Former Pitt star and current

played in the third Pittsburgh Bas-

of the night, but it was the current
Pitt players on the court during

dzhe most.

Blair, a center who declared for
the NBA draft after his sophomore
season, arrived shortly before his
game was set to start, watching
as incoming Pitt freshman John

energized the crowd and led their
team to a win over senior Ashton

The award winner is also determined by sports
writers, sportscasters, NCAA head coaches
and Maxwell Football Club Members.

- has never won the Bednarik Award.

Thinking of Quitting
Smoking? The Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh seeks
smokers aged 18-65
who are already plan-
ning to quit smoking to
participate in a 9-week
research study on the
short-term effects of
two oral medications
on smoking behavior,
craving, and mood.
One‘ is FDA-approved
for smoking cessation,
Zyban (bupropion),
and the other is FDA-
approved for wakeful-
ness, Provigil
(modaﬁnil). This is
not a treatment study.
You will be asked to
take- study medication
that may or may not
contain the active com-
ponents. Research
study participants will
be compensated. Al-
though this study is not
a treatment trial, every-
one who completes the
study will‘ be offered
optional brief counsel-
ing and Zyban (bupro-
pion) at no cost after
the study is over to

help them quit perma-V

nehtly. For more infor-
mation, visit our web-
site at www.smok-
