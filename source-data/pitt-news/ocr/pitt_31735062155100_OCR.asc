UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Fifth Regional Campus Opens S

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1964

At Ellwood City Sept. 1966

Ellwood City will be the site of the University’s fifth regional campus in western
Pennsylvania. The new campus which will join existing ones in Bradford, Greensburg,‘
J ohnstown, ad Titusville, should admit students by September of 1066.

The Ellwood City campus will offer the ﬁrst four terms of liberal.arts and en-
gineering as well as graduate work at the master’s level in education, business, library
and information science. The course offerings will include evening adult education class-

the jurisdiction of the Student Publications Board.
Senator Jerry Hogan, who proposed the resolution at

the SG meeting last Thursday, argued that the Polaris was

not a money making proposition and SG had to make up the

loss each year.

Senator Hogan also presented
a report to the senate from Mel-
vin Stein, business manager, and
Sandy Drake, editor of the 1963-
64 Polaris which expressed the
opinion that the handbook should
be considered. an independent
publication. _

The report stated that the
Polaris had grown from a pock-
et size handbook in 1958 to a .
publication rated “First Class”
by the Associated Collegiate
Press. According to the report
no actual liaison existed be-
tween Polaris and SG other
than the allocation supplied by
SG.
~~SG passed a bill which directs

the Spirit Award Committee to -

insure that banners hung in the
Towers lobby will be validated
«by Men’s Dorm Council.

SG unanimously passed a res-
olution expressing the student
‘oody’s sympathy at the death of
Dr. H. C. Carlson, former basket-
ball coach. The resolution said,
“The students at Pitt who were
fortunate enough to be associ-
ated with Doc Carlson will al-
ways remember him as a man
deeply concerned with student
problems and sincerely interest-
ed in providing friendly counsel
to all members of the University.

‘Measure for Mea sure’, Opens Run

STEPHEN FOSTER MEMORIAL is where these four thespians are
playing in “Measure for Measure,” a University Theatre production.
Seen in the picture are (left to right) Jim Crawford, Carol Silver,
Bill Kingsley, and Dan Frezza. ‘

 

By WAYNE CLAEREN

Get set for a rave review. I just saw a play which
which is to be highly recommended to one and all. It’s call-
ed Measure for Measure and it is currently playing at near-
by Stephen Foster Memorial so there is no reason why
every one who want to can’t see it. And everyone at the
University should. -

Possibly Shakespeare’s most “serious” comedy, Meas-
ure for Measure is a difficult show to stage. The University
is up to the task. The excellent idea of inviting well known
Pittsburgh actor Richard Galuppi to play the Duke has

contributed greatly to the success of the show. Not only

is Mr. Galuppi’s performance a treat to watch in every respect, but
also brings up each of the other cast members. Having professional
actors work in University Theater is excellent experience both for
the veteran and the novices—and of course an added treat for the
audience.

The Players support Mr. G.aluppi in ﬁne fashion. Two well played
scenes between the Duke (in disguise) and the obnoxious Fantastic,
Lucio, played by Dan Frezza come to mind ﬁrst. Forrest Sears, a
grad student with professional background, adds sparkle to the show
in his marvelous rendition of Pompey the “clever” Tapster.

The play has many opportunities for short but signiﬁcant per-‘
formances and in every case a capable actor has appeared to ﬁll the
bill. Harvey Miller is a rugged, serious type as the Duke’s Deputy
contrasted by several foolish fellows notably Elbow, played to_a
tee by Bill Kingsley. William Phelps, Hamish J. Patrick, Jamee Berry
and several others are quite good in brief but well played roles.

Frank Maraden may be typed as a spear carrier but he gets
much more of a chance to shine here than in Twelfth Night and a
number one job he does as the Provost.

The ladies do not have such juicy roles as the men do in this
one, but Barbara J. Lyon, Valerie Stasik, and Carole Silver hold up
the femininevcause with charm and grace. And I promise you will

region, is expected to be be-
tween 100 and 150. The project-
ed growth is 600 or 700 students
within seven or eight years, ac-
cording to Dr. John Geise, vice

chancellor for regional programs. -

“Beyond that,” he said, “plans
call for a limited growth to a
maximum of 1,000.” A

The initial faculty of at least
ten members will reside at the
new campus. All graduate work
will be taught by full-time pro-
fessors from the Oakland cam-
pus.

The regional campus will op-
erate on the trimester system,

enabling a student to complete "

two years of work in a year and
one-third. Although the tuition
rate has not been set, Dr. Geisé
indicated that it will be equival-
lent to that at the other regional

L campuses (presently 28 dollars

per credit).

The choice of Ellwood City as
the site of a regional campus was
the culmination of a feasibility
study conducted after the com-
munity civic, business, and edu-
cational leaders’ request of two
years ago. ,

“We feel that Ellwood City
represents an excellent potential
for a regional campus. We look
forward to the opportunity for
he University to make .a contri-
bution in the highly industrialized
Beaver Valley.”

The exact site and the presi-
dent of the campus will be an-
nounced in the near future as
will a campus development com-
mittee which will carry out the

community's responsibility in es- I

tablishing the regional campus.

Colin Sterne’s music, the well

seriousness about it as well as
spicy and witty humor. In addi-

Child’s Oral Communication

Two University researchers have completed an 18-month study
to determine if the early use of sign language inhibits a deaf child’s
ability to communicate in English. The research, directed by Dr. Jack
Birch, associate dean of the School of Education, and Dr. E. Ross
Stuckless, was conducted under a grant from the U. S. Office of
Education.

The researchers also tried to solve the dilemma of whether any
method of communication, however imperfect, is better than none.
Some authorities argue that besides depriving the child of the abil-
ity to speak and understand English linguistic structures, a child

Dr. Birch and Dr. Stuckless
point out, however,‘ that early
use of sign language teaches the
child the value of communica-
tion and gives him a social and
psychological advantage over the
very deaf child who is isolated
and possesses only the most prim-
itive means of communication

After studying a select group
of deaf children, half with deaf
parents and half with hearing
parents, the two researchers
found that deaf children who
have learned signs in infancy
tend to be more apt in. reading,
writing’. and lipreading than
those who do not learn a lan-
guage until they reach school age.

The study included children
from schools for the deaf in In-

University’s series of research

in the development of language

Nancy Fuchs Talks on
College Woman’s Role

College women are standing On the Threshhold in respect 130 the
new role of women according to Nancy Fuchs, Thursday's speaker
at the YWCA’s lecture series on the “Role of Women in Our Society.”

‘,‘I am using the word “threshhold” in a double sense,” explained
Miss Fuchs, a junior English major and the only student speaker in
the series. College women are standing on the threshhold of adult
life, but also in respect to the larger dimension of Time.

“Never before has the college woman had so many and such
complex decisions to make‘ as she has today.” She Said- This creates
a dilemma for the modern college woman who is faced with six basic

choices: marriage, career, grad-
uate school, and combinations of
each. V

Miss Fuchs stressed the impor-
tance of a man and woman com-
pleting their education before
marriage. “Marriage is difficult
enough with the many .adjust-
ment that have to be made with-
out combining study and work,
too,” she claimed.

“I also believe that if a young
woman should go on to graduate
school and then decide to get
married, she has a responsibility

Reviews:

By WAYNE CLAEBEN

Last Saturday the Pittsburgh
Playhouse opened its ﬁrst mu-
sical for this season—-She Loves
Me. With the two comedy hits,
Thousand Clowns and Oh Dad.
Poor Dad, already on the boards
of the Playhouse’s two other the-
aters, She Loves Me should make
a full house of successful shows
for the community theater.

The book and songs of She
Loves Me are nice but not out-
standing. The story is an unlike-
ly one involving a guy and a gal
who can’t get along as co-work-
ers in a European perfume shop.
At night, however, each writes
tender letters to .a secret pen pal.
It is no secret to the audience
who the pen pals are. What
makes the coincidental tale fun
is that we see two very ordinary
people having such a wonderful
adventure in very common sur-
roundings.

The songs are cute and enjoy-
able but include no special hits.
The most memorable tune is the
title song which deserves at least
a reprise that it does not receive.

The cast all enjoy the show
and the audience soon catch the
spirit of light-hearted fun and
romance. William W. Rhodes is a

Few people come out of the University of Pittsburgh with an

l'heiFo|ly of iviiassttEducationij 

Education, as we see it, is a life process spurred on by a hunger
to know. There is the pupil who takes Dr. Richard Rubenstein’s course
in_ French existentialism because he thinks he should and will be able to
nod knowingly at a cocktail party when someone tosses out a comment

faculty. And it is not the result of the trimester system.

It is superﬁcial to examine education in light of’ these factors and
most symbolic of the way in which this concept has been commercialized.
Eduation, unfortunately, is regarded as something you get; the more
degrees you have the more you've got; as long as you go through the’

motions society applauds.

These ‘contributing factors.cannot be ignored but neither can the
total deﬁnition of education, and somewhere in this land of mass con-

sumption it has been buried.

We contend that a college training in liberal arts can only present
the tools of education to the pupil; that only when he lets any academic
stimulation get at him and he uses the tools he has gotten from class is

he a student and on his way to becoming educated.

Full Employment

 

on No Exit. There is the student who ﬁnds himself in the bookstore and

must restrain himself from buying every edition they have of Sartre at
the same time.

We realize that a college education ha.s become a prerequisite for
living any kind of middle class life. We can understand this when it

provides vocational or professional training, but for the majority of

undergraduates in liberal arts courses. this educational experience for
them is a complete farce.

Any education, to be signiﬁcant, must include an incorporation of

these tools and a life-long acquisition of knowledge. Most undergradu-
ates, unfortunately, speak of going out into the world after their educa-
tion has been completed. This very attitude shows how this concept has

been distorted. Again, we say, look at yourselves "before you complain.

The Triple Revolution

By Irv Garfinkel

In my last article I dis-
cussed Sen. Joseph Clarks’
proposals to achieve full em-
ployment. Some men argue
persuasively that just be-
cause it is unattai'nable, the
goal of full employment
should be abandoned. In-
cluded in this,group are

men as R. L.

Gunnar Myr-
dal, Michael
Harrington,
T h e a r g u -
ments of and
the solutions
propposed by
these men de-
serves to be
examined.

,When Carey McWilliams,
editor of the Nation, and a
member of this group of
thinkers spoke here last
year, he talked about how
automation is rapidly elim-

GARFINKEL

_ inating jobs.

In order to understand why
automation eliminates jobs
it is necessary to distinguish
between the industrial rev-
olution and the coming cy-
bernetics revolution.

In the former, technical
progress in production ne-
cessitated a change in men’s
role in the productive sys-

'tem. There was always a

partnership between men
and machines. The essence
of cybernatics, however, is
that the machine operates
and regulates itself. Routine
blue and white collar jobs
will be eliminated.

THE RESULTS of this
cybernetics revolution can-
not be stressed enough. Soon,
these men say, there will
not be jobs for approxi-
mately one-fifth of our peo-
ple. We could be facing a

Heilbronner,

permanent depression.

Now if these men are cor-
rect in believing that auto-
mation will produce momen-
tous changes in our econom-
ic and social system —— and I
think they are — then it is

extremely important for us-

to consider the alternative
solutions "to the complex
problems that are now be-
ing raised by these changes.
If I am not mistaken it is

.our generation that will

make the choices. We are
responsible for the kind of
society We and‘ our children
will live in.

So what do these men pro-
pose? Their short term pro-
posals, as set forth in a
paper on the “Triple Revo-
lution in Cybernetics, Wea-
ponry and Human Rights,”
are very much the same as
Clark's: massive expendi-
tures for public works, low
cost housing, repaid trans-
it, education, etc. They even
recommend “a major re-
vision of our tax structure
aimed at redistributing in-
come.” And lastly. they sug-
gest that the government
use its licensing power to
regulate the speed of cyber-
nation to minimize personal
hardship.‘

But it should be noted,
these proposals will not
solve the long range prob-
lem. Because after we re-
build our cities, etc., there
will be a large segment of
our population that can’t
get jobs.

NOW WE COME to the
most radical suggestion of
this group. They say that
income must be divorced
from work. Robert Theobald
in an article of the May 11,
1963 issue of the Nation ad-

vocated that the government
guarantee everyone a mini-
mum income. One gets the
idea however, that income
would be divorced from
work for only those who
don’t work. Although I real-
ize Theobald didn’t have
this in mind, the danger is
that his plan would be re-
reduced to an atrocious ex-
tension of our- welfare and
relief system to permanent-
ly cover one-fifth of our
population.

Because governments nor-
mally do as little as possible
to ameliorate social prob-
lems, the junemployable 20
per cent of our population
could easily become a per-
manenty ignored and invis-
ible poor. I can envision a
society where generation af-
ter generation of‘ a large
percentage of our families
receive a guaranteed annual
income from the government
because they can’t get jobs.
We already have families
like this. The aim is to break
the vicious cycle, not toen-
large the membership of
those participating.

In my next article I will
offer some further objec-
tions to the idea of detach-
ing income from work for
those who can’t get work.
But if these men are correct
in their belief that full em-
ployment is now impossible,
then proclaiming the vir-
tues of “a job for every
man” is a sterile exercise.
So I will offer some reasons
for believing that automa-
tion might not make full em-
ployment unattainable. This
last task Will then lead me
into a subsequent discussion
of the relevance for 20th
century America of social-
ism.

Nationality Room

Architect Praised

Editor, The Pitt News:

On Sept. 26 the Irish Times
carried an editorial appreciation
of Dr. Harold Graham Leask,
architect of the Irish Room in
the Cathedral of Learning.

Everytime a student crosses
the campus and looks up at the
Cathedral of Learning, an aesthe-
tic cultural experience in his,
namely, being surrounded with
the work of famous architects.
Charles Z. Klauder was awarded
the Grand Prix and Silver Medal
for his design of the Cathedral
of Learning at the Pan-American
Congress held in 1927 in Buenos
Aires. In the national art of his
country, no Irish architect was
more distinguished than Dr. Le-
ask, of whom the Irish Times
wrote:

“Harold Graham Leask is dead
and, in a way, his passing may
be said to mark the end of an
era; for his was the generation
that brought the antiquarianism
of the past within the disciplined
conﬁnes of scientiﬁc archaeology
and the sober study of the his-
tory of architecture . . . his ma-
jor works, “Irish Castles” and the
three invaluable volumes of his
‘Irish Churches and Monastic
Buildings,’ set the seal on Har-
old Leask’s life’s work. He was

the chief scholar in his ﬁeld in H

Ireland, beloved here, respected
abro.aAd.’n’, ' .

 

The University of Pittsburgh is
fortunate indeed to have a class-
room designed by this great Irish
architect.

Editor, The Pitt News:

Who said Lincoln freed all the
slaves? Recently two instructors
in an engineering department,
who happen to share the same
office, scheduled tests for their
students,

The courses they teach are
three and four credit courses for
seniors. At least three students
are enrolled in bo_th classes, with
12 students in each class. The
funny thing is that both instruc-
tors scheduled their tests (three
hour exams) on the same day.
The day—the Wednesday after
Election Day.

Now if you are a bit interested
in politics and want to try to
watch election returns on tele-
vision, you just go ahead and
ﬂunk one of the two tests, or
both. Because you can’t ﬁght City
Hall. And if you try, you will
blow your brains out. If you
have any brains left at all.

Five—Year Curriculum

(Collegiate Press Service)

The president of the University
of Rhode Island, Kingston, urged
that colleges extend their under-
graduate curriculum to ﬁve years
instead of the traditional four
In an article in the November
issue of the National Education
Associations NEA Journal, Fran-
cis H. Horn charged that the
task of educating the college stu-
dent for today’s world is an “im-
possible one.”

“Although the time required
for college remains the same as it
was in the 17th century, the
amount of the world’s knowledge

'-has increased manifold,” he said.
In addition to acquiring this ex-
panded body of general know-
ledge today’s student is also ex-
pected to specialize in prepara-
tion for a job or to meet the
requirements of graduate study.

Faced with so many conﬂict-
ing demands, it is remarkable
that colleges and universities do
as well as they do with their

al board of advisors to represent
the community to the University.

students,” Horn said.

The Rhode Island University
president dismissed the two ma-
jor arguments which have been
raised against lengthening the

, time a student spends in college.

Admitting that changing our ed-
ucational system to eliminate re-
petition could cut a year from
the total now required, he con-
tended that it is still desirable
to have ﬁve years for the bach-
elor’s degree because “knowledge
is continuing to proliferate at a
rapid rate and post-baccalaureate
study is largely specialized.”

The argument that students
will not stay in college another
year, Horn said, is specious. The
trend is toward more education,
and today graduation from col-
lege is as common as graduation
from high school was half a cen-
tury ago.

ence, the ﬁrst of its kind to be
held at the University, will be
concerned with the internal struc-
ture of the earth. Among the
topics to be studied are reversals
in the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld and
the continental drift and polar
wandering.

Dean Arman Frederickson,
chaiman of the Department of
Earth and Planetary Science, said
that the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is
rapidly decreasing and if it con-
tinues, may mean a biological
change and the evolution of new
forms of life through mutation.
Also, he said, huge cracks in the
earth’s crust are Tyeing studied to
trace the separating of huge land
masses.

At the Benedum symposim, the

.main topic will center on outer
space inﬂuences on the earth,
including how the geomagnetic
ﬁeld changes when coming in
contact with solar ﬂares and
other phenomena.

Sessions for the IAGA confer-
ence will be held from 9 a.m. to
5:30 p.m. each day. Benedum ses-
sions will run from 8:30 a.m. to
5 p.m.

Both conferences are open to

Panthers’ Best Not Enough to Win

Notre Dame Given Big Scare

But Manages Narrow Victory

By non sM1z'm'

It was an unusual scene in John Mich-
elosen’s office after Saturday’s 17-15 loss
to Notre Dame at the Stadium. Michelosen,
always a hard loser, was not taking one of
the toughest defeats of his career too hard.
In fact, there was a touch of pride in his
voice as he discussed the game-—and deservedly so.

“This was a tough one for the kids because
they put out so much,” Michelosen said. “They all
gave it everything they had. It was a heck‘ of a
lesson for them.”

Chances are Michelosen was thinking of his
gutty fullback Barry McKnight when he made the

A ' last statement. .

Barry McKnight will play better games, though
he hasn't yet. But he will never give more of him-
self than he did Saturday. Coaches .and players
alike were emphatic in their praise of the junior
fullback from Indiana, Pa., who last week out-
played all-America candidate Jim Nance and this
week battered the Notre Dame line like no other
back has done this year.

“McKnight is a hell-of-a-fullback," said Notre
Dame's wonder coach Ara Parseghian, John Michel-
osen said, “Barry ran just great.” Teammate Marty
Schottenheimer told a reporter after the game:
“Make this 811! (McKnight) an all-American. He

' put on the greatest individual performance I've-

ever seen.”

What McKnight did was gain 93 yards rushing, ,

not a staggering ﬁgure until you realize that Notre
Dame has given up only an average of 30 yards
a game on the ground. McKnight outgained three
entire teams Saturday.

What McKnight did was set up the first Pan-
ther score on a smashing ten yard run to the Notre
Dame one and then carry over from there. He
cracked oﬁ tackle from three yards out for the
two-point conversion to make it a 14-8 ball game
in the second quarter.

In the fourth quarter, on a fourth and one sit-
uation on the Notre Dame one-yard line, McKnight
was temporarily stopped by the massive Irish de-
fense, but he never gave up (rolled to his left and
lunged over the line.

“We had him momentarily stopped,” Parseghian
said. “I suppose our kids thought the whistle blew
or something and he just kept on going over the
goal. It was just a great effort on McKnight’s part.”

McKnight was not the only Panther to put forth
a great effort. “It was our best team effort of the
season,” according to Michelosen. “Our oﬂense
looked a little better earlier in the season, but
this was our best eﬂort oﬂensively and defensive-
ly combined.”

The oﬁensive effort was aided in no small way

by the play of tackle Ron Linaburg. Linaburg,
who has not played since the second game of the
season, took over the offensive right tackle spot
and according to Michelosen “combined with
(Eric) Crabtree and (Mitch) Zalnasky to give
McKnight some tremendous blocking.”

Fred Mazurek must have been appreciative of
Linaburg’s return to the lineup. He picked up 85
yards on the ground, playing his best game since
he ran all over William & Mary.

But it was the one yard that Mazurek did not
make which may have cost the Panthers the game.
Trailing 17-15 midway through the ﬁnal period,
Pitt had moved the ball down to the Notre Dame
17 where a fourth and one situation came up
again.

_ Michelosen sent ‘in the play which called for
Mazurek to sneak for the yard. He was stopped
inches short and the ball went over to Notre Dame.
“The turf was loose where I started to move for-
ward,” Mazurek said. “And when I pushed off with

o my. right foot to go left I stumbled and went on

my face.”_

Michelosen could have gone for a ﬁeld goal
at that point. When asked if he gave the ﬁeld goal
attempt any thought he said, “Hell, yeah. We gave
it a hell of a lot of thought. But we didn’t do it.
If I had to do it all over again I would do it the
same way. If we make the ﬁrst down We have
four more cracks at getting .a touchdown and we
still can come back and get the ﬁeld goal if we
want.”

Notre Dame got a ﬁeld goal and that was the
difference in the game. Joe Azzaro, a sophomore
from Central Catholic High School, just down the
street from Pitt, booted a 29-yard ﬁeld goal after
McKnight’s ﬁrst score and that was the margin
of difference.

For a while it looked as though three points
would be an insigniﬁcant ﬁgure as Notre Dame
looked like the best team to enter the Stadium in
many years in the ﬁrst quarter.

The ﬁrst time they got the ball they moved 80
yards for a score. Moments later quarterback John
Huarte threw a 91 yard scoring pass to Nick Eddy
and it looked like the rout was on. Notre Dame
later advanced to the Panther two, still in the ﬁrst
quarter, but fumbled there and from then on it
was a different game.

McKnight blamed the Panthers ﬁrst period lapse
on inexperience. “Last year we used to kill teams
in the ﬁrst quarter because we had all the experi-
ence,” he said. “Now it's the other way around.
We have a lot of sophomores on our defensive
unit. They were playing against the best team in
the country. They were bound to be nervous. But
once we got things straightened out we were
great.”

Especially Barry McKnight.

Akron Scores Once;
Booters Lose Again

. By BILL CABIN
It was another frustrating game for the soccer team
as they lost to Akron Saturday at Forbes Field, 1-0. The
lost was the third consecutive for the ‘booters, and dropped
their. season mark to 4-4, eliminating any prospects of

NCAA playoff consideration.

Although the booters constant-
ly penetrated the Akron defense
and outshot them 14-7, they were
unable to capitalize on any drive.
“We had no sharp shots,” said
Bemis.

The lack of sharp shooting has
been Bemis’ chief complaint
throughout the season, In their
eight games, the booters have
outshot every opponent except
(Maryland), while only outscor-
scoring their opposition, 24-20.

George Otieno scored the game’s
only goal with nine minutes gone
in the ﬁrst quarter. Otieno har-
rassed Panther center halfback
Andy McGraw and both received
warnings from the referee, with
McGraw being thrown out early
in the second quarter for an in-
tentional foul on Otieno.

“It was a see-saw game,” Ak-
ron coach Stu Parry. “Neither
team controlled the entire game.
Both teams played good defense,
and both missed several scoring
opportunitie-s.”

 

Akron’s center half Neil Koch- F

osky and goalie Dave Pearce led
the Akron defense, The ﬁerce
Pearce constantly came out of the
goal blocking shots, while Koch-
osky thwarted several Panther
drives with his long kicks.

Cal Bonawitz, who replaced
McGraw at center half, played
a good defensive game as did left
fullback. Jim Cuddyand goalie
Ken Lang. Cuddy has been hamp-
ered by a pulled musicle for the
past two weeks, but showed good
form as he played the entire
game.

Greek Titles to Phi Ep, Theta Chi

By GEORGE LIES

Phi Epsilon Pi won the
Fraternity A League Foot-
ball championship last Wed-
nesday, trouncing Delta Sig-
ma Phi, 32-0. Phi Ep dom-
inated the league with a 4-0
mark, outscoring opposition, 77-0.

Phi Ep’s defense thwarted a
Delta Sig drive early in the ﬁrst
half, with Brian Fisher inter-
cepting Ralph Cappy’s pass and
running 76 yards for a touch-
down. Quarterback Rick Rogow
scored the extra point on an end
run.

Incomplete passes- and penal-
ties forced Delta Sig to punt
throughout the ﬁrst half. Fisher
took a punt and returned it 40
yards, giving Phi Ep a 14-0 half-
time lead.

Phi Ep continued its domin-
ance in the second half scoring in
its ﬁrst four plays. Rogow com-
pleted an 18 yard pass to center
Carl Kaplan, then ran 16 yards,
capping the drive on a 19 yard
touchdown pass to Fisher.

Fisher had an outstanding per-
formance, scoring 28 points. End
Rick Abrams, who led the Phi
scored the other
touchdown on a 42 yard pass.

George Prussin, Phi Ep cap-

tain and defense halfback, said,
“We were fired up and really
wanted the win.”

Theta Chi edged Pi Kappa Al-
pha, 7-0, winning the Fraternity
B League title. Neither team
sccccd in the first half.

In the opening moments of the
second half, Quarterback Tony
Liberati passed 20 yards to Mel
Vignovic for the winning score.
Jack Kneiss then caught a Lib-
erati pass for the extra point.

Liberati was elated about the
win since, “Pike is the biggest
team we have played.”

Pika placed in the ﬁnals with
a 7-0 victory over Zeta Beta Tau.
With only four seconds remain-
ing, Don Sweeney caught a 35
yard pass from Frank Fusaro for
the winning score. Sweeney then
passed to Greg Denis for the ex-
tra point.

Hawthorne edged Random, 7-6,
to win the Dormitory League
title. Quarterback Steve Solnoki
ran two yards for the touchdown,
and passed to Len Fox for the
winning conversion. Lou Cepanec
passed 50 yards to John I-Ilywa
for Random’s touchdown.
