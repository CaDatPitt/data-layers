In the 1930s, the voice of then—Pres-
ident Franklin Roosevelt boomed
over radios across the country dur-
ing his renowned “ﬁreside chats.”

Thirty years later, broadcasts
featuring President John Kenne-
dy appeared on the televisions of
citizens nationwide and became a
familiar household face.

Now in 2012, President Barack
Obama and Republican presidential
nominee Mitt Romney have taken
to the Internet.

Politicians’ use of technology
to reach a mass audiencelis noth-
ing new. And according to profes-
sors and scholars, the addition of
an online network to campaigning

. has enabled candidates to reach a -

larger, quantity of people, including
potential voters who might not have
participated in the political process
otherwise. In the past few election
cycles, it has also provided voters
more resources through which to‘
inform themselves, although ex-
perts and common users alike cau-
tion that both candidates and voters
must be wary of the information
ﬂoating around in cyberspace.

The 2008 presidential cam-
paign, often referred to as the
“Internet Election,” was the ﬁrst
time that a presidential candidate
actively used the World Wide Web to
both mobilizeand engage potential
voters.

Political science professor Shan-
non Scotece indicated that this mo-

bilization became the difference .

Pitt grad, former Libyan prime

Mahmoud Jibril, Pitt graduate and
former Libyan prime minister, spoke
regarding the role of youth in shap-
ing global politics during aUniversity
Distinguished Lecture onwednesday
in Alumni Hall’s J.W. Connolly Ball-
room.’ v

As youth throughout the world
continue to become tech-savvy and
connect to the outside world, they
also become more acutely aware of
the abuses perpetrated by their own
governments. This culminatedin the
Arab Spring, which beganinDecem-
ber 2010.

“When that young man inTunisia
burned himself, thatwas the tipping
point, but itwas not the cause,”Jibril
said, referring to one youth who went
to extremes to draw attention to the
oppressive regimein his country.

Jibril, whojwas the chairman of ‘

executive board of the National Tran-

minis reﬂects 11 Arab Spring

sitional Council, discussed the role of
the youth and of social media, as well
as the outlookfor a newly democratic
Libya. He also spoke on the dramatic
changes that have taken place across
the Middle East over the last two years
along with the challenges the region
will face heading into the future.
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg in-
troducedjibril at the invitation— only
luncheon, stating that he earned a
master’s degree and a doctorate —
both in political science —— from Pitt
in 1980 and 1985, respectively. He
outlined ]ibril’s career, explaining
that the former prime minister has
also been involved in development
projects throughout the world.
Jibril resigned from the position of
interim prime minister after Moarn—
mar Gadhaﬁ’s death a year ago.Jibril
currently heads the National Forces
Alliance, composed of more than 60
different political and miscellaneous
organizations. - l ‘ » 7 V

Former Libyan Transitional Council leader Mahmoud Jibril discussed the role of youth in shaping Middle
4 East politics during a lecture on Wednesday at Pitt. Kenny orig [Visual Editor — . - '

recalling a 2005 interview with the

. Al—Jazeeraprogram“Frontiers,”dur-

ing which he discussed the future of
the Middle East. _

“My argument was that the fu-
ture of the Arab world was going to
be made by the dot—com generation,”

Jibril said.

The younger generation, Jibril
said, enjoys a level of connectivity to
the rest of world that previous gen-
erations have not reached. In earlier
years, the public in Libya and in other
authoritarian nations relied on state-
controlled media. .

The discontent among the youth
cuhninated in the Arab Spring.

However, Jibril said that once
many of the oppressive regimes were
toppled, political elites — rather than
the youth who initiated the uprisi
ings through their demonstrations
—— seized power. He said he believes

Renovated
physics labs
to enhance

research

Matt Schaff
Senior Stcyff Wrz'ter

Visions of microscopic computers
and soon-to-be-discovered forms
of matter inspired a group of'fac-
ulty and administrators on Tues-
day when they met to celebrate
an important milestone in Pitt’s
experimentalphysics research.

After investing 15,000 man
hours to move six to 10 tons of
concrete and install a menagerie
of modern laboratory features,
Pitt has completed its ﬁrst-phase
of the rnidcampus renovation
project. I ' *

A massive coordination be-
tween the-University, contractors
and federal stimulus dollars, the
project provides the Department
of Physics and Astronomy with
state—of—the-art laboratory space
in Old Engineering Hall and the
Pittsburgh Nuclear Physics Lab-
oratory. Additional renovations

to Allen Hall, Thaw Hall and the.

Space Research Coordination Cen-
ter are expected to becompleted
by August 2013. '

“It’s marvelous. Wall-to-wall
infrastructure,” said former
Pitt Vice Provost for Research
George Klinzing in reference to
the sophisticated orchestration
of building design, materials and
machinery that keeps the new labs
running. “This wasn’t something
that happened overnight.”

It also wasn’t something that
happened for free. I

Barack Obama during his 2008 campaign
for the White House.

“Obama and the Democrats used Face-
book, Twitter and MySpace and were better
at it than John McCain,” she said. “Because
Obama was able to use Facebook well, he was
able to reach out to the younger population
that was already using it.”

Somewhere down the line, the use of radio
and television —— along with newspapers —
fell into the category of “traditional sources,”
according to Scotece.

This categorization resulted from the
emergence of the Internet, and with this
emergence came a dramatic increase in the
involvement of young people from their par-
ticipation levels only two decades before.

“Young people didn’t vote a lot in the ’90s,”
Scotece said. “It was this huge crisis.”

According to civicyouth.org, voter _turnout_.

at  percent  2008 presidentléileleé
tio'n.“This statistic ‘stands as a notable increase
from the 40 percent of young voters that came
out for the 1996 election. ’

One of the greatest attractions of online
politics for young people is that it’s a place
they already go.

“{Politicians] are using a language that
young people use to communicate with each
other,every,day,” Scotece added.

cal,dietetics and nutrition major, uses social

media sites like Twitter to follow all the major
news stations and political parties.

“It’s interesting because I follow both ex-
tremes. I follow CNN and Fox News, but I also
follow NBC,” she said. “It’s interesting to see
which stories they post on a social network.”

Restrepo acknowledges that these news
stations have the potential to clarify a lot
of quotes from the debates on their Twitter
accounts. _

“For example, if Romney says something
during a debate, CNN has a tendency to post
[his quote] and counteract it with an article
based on their research,” Restrepo said.

Pitt political science professor Kristen
Allen is amazed by the role social media has
played in this election, and she said the virtual
world provides quicker access to information.

”The Internet has picked up on the best
aspects of print and visual communication,”

Allen said. “And it gives people immediate.

access at any time.”
Graduate teaching assistant Eric Loepp

agrees. ,

' “Back in thejday, y

 had to wait until a

 journalist wrote an article and got it printed
' up, especially if it occurred somewhere else,”

Loepp said. 7

And this aspect of immediate access is
what drives the younger population -— stu-
dents included — to the Internet for political
information.

. Sophomore George Totolos, prospectively
majoring in computer science, commented
on the speed with which he can ﬁnd informa-
tion online.

“It’s a hell of a lot more efficient than the

 rm mm; mu [it

Sllllllil illih  itllihll I0 l""lllial‘,lii[§ll‘: fC>l‘: ﬂllll

pony express,” he said. .

Restrepo is fond of the convenience of
a single social media network that holds a
variety of viewpoints, such as Twitter.

“It’s nice to get the constant updates in
one location rather than checking all the in-
dividual Websites,” she said.

Prior to the Internet, voters were limited
to the perspectives of local or national news-
papers and television networks that projected
political information.

“With the Internet explosion, suddenly
[voters] had all these sources of information,”
Scotece said.

She said these sources include blogs,
online newspapers, political websites and
social media. She added that the Internet is
enhancing the democratic process.

“Everyone has the potential to be in-
formed and just participate in discourse,”
Scotece added. “It’s easier for them to see a
range of perspectives.” _

.Restrepo now feels that she can actively
form her own political identity.

' “Before it was everything I would see in
the newspapers or that my family would tell
me,” she said. “NowI have the ability to reach
out on my own.”

She noted the importance of keeping her

. Twitter feed impartial.

“I try to followas many different varieties
[of views] aspossible so I don’t have a strong

bias toward one candidate during the elec— ‘

tion,” Restrepo said.

that many are starting to hold positions in the
National Forces Alliance.

Ibrahim Fares, a law student from the West
Bank city of Ramallah, said he thought thatjibril
demonstrated his belief in freedom and democ-
racy during Wednesday’s remarks. Fares said
that although he has followedjibril through the
media, he was still excited to see the politician
in person for the first time.

Fares drew a contrast betweenjibril and the
ruling partyinanother nascentArab democracy
to illustrate his alignment withjibril’s statements

‘ regarding youth in politics.

“In Egypt, when the revolution succeeded,

the Muslim Brotherhood said, ‘We are the rul— ‘

ers,”’ Fares said, “butjibril is still thinking about
the young generation.”

During his talk,]ibril also explained a plan he
called Libya Vision 2025, pointing out that Libya
could serve as a bridge between Europe and
Africa. While western Europe will suffer from a
deﬁcit in skilled labor, the population of Africa
will continue to grow. Libya’s role in this shift-
ing world could be that of a hub in which many
potential workers from the rest ofAfrica could be
trained to work in western Europe._]ibr_il added

line and professional workforce provide it with
advantages for economic development. I

The national parks are a lesson in

meaningful govee

. Rosie McKinley

Columnist

In the summer of 1998 my parents
ambitiously purchased a car top
carrier and their ﬁrst cell phones.
For two months we traveled west
to California, stopping at se‘er_n—
ingly every National Park, monu-
ment and battleground along the
way. Cramped in the back seat
were ﬁve kids and Spike the fam-
ily dog. Together we’d gone to look
for America out of the windows of
our Chevy Suburban. ‘

Just as my family did during

that late—‘9os summer, millions of

Americans visit the National Parks
annually. In these most precious of
our country’s treasures, we ﬁnd the
America that belongs to all of us.

Campaign rhetoric might have
you thinking the federal govern-
ment can accomplish no good and
that its spending is always waste-
ful. Our National Parks disprove
this cynicism. While there is plenty
that needs to be revised in regard
to efficiency and spending, the
National Park Service is one area
of the government that has been
successful. V 6

In today’s context of economic

- recession and political turmoil, we

might question whether the Na-

tional Parks are worth the federal

support they receive. They are.
The National Park Service

currently employs more than‘

22,000 people and in 2010 cost

about $3.16 billion in government I

spending. Considering the total

cated in the Sierra National Forest in Caiifornia. MCT Campus

federal expenditures for that year
amounted to more than $3.7 tril-
lion, the parks cost less than .01
percent of the federal budget.
But the Park Service doesn’t
just cost funds, it generates them.
As major tourist destinations, the
parks generate $10 in local econo-

mies for every $1 spentlwithin the to

park.

Nevertheless, many politicians
have suggested transferring con-
trol of public lands to the states,
therefore allowing individual, state
legislatures -— many of which are
tight on budgets —— to decide the
fate of our collective national trea-
sures. This would end a long tradi-

LETTER T0 THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

College students are full of bad ideas. Spend 10 minutes on Forbes and Atwood on a Friday night, and
you will see many of them manifest before your very eyes. Sometimes, we college.students think, “It would
be so cool if _____,” but we rarely consider the consequences.

at games, while a cool idea, fails to acknowledge the negative consequences of the plan. Caged animals are
very stressed; add the bright lights, noise and crowds at the games, and that’s a recipe for disaster. Not only
does it create a potentially dangerous situation, it is also cruel for the animal involved. This year, Louisiana
Tech’s mascot, an English bulldog, was killed when a vet tech left him in the heat.

It would also be a total waste of our tuition money. During a time of tight budgets, Pitt could allocate the

0 funds toward academic resources and scholarships, keeping tuition low. Using these funds for a potentially

dangerous and cruel gimmick is not a smart use of resources. . . .
Lastly, let’s face it: Roc, well, rocks. Our amazing mascot right now is enough to get the crowds pumped!
I strongly urge Alex to rethink his plan and drop it completely. Sure, it would be cool, but let’s think of
the consequences. I ’

tion of the federal government protecting
public lands and would also signify the end
of the parks themselves.

The federal government established the
National Park Service in 1916 but began pro-
tecting public lands as early as 1872 with the
creation of Yellowstone National Park. The
importance of man’s connection to land in
a country conceived by immigrants from
crowded European cities goes back further
still.

The current Secretary of the Interior,
Ken Salazar, who oversees the National Park
Service, has continued the federal govern-
ment’s conservation of the parks, or what

President Theodore Roosevelt once called,
“the patriotic duty of insuring the safety and
continuance of the nation.” Under Salazar,
the parks have been protected from thou-
sands of drilling requests made by private

companies looking to beneﬁt from the natu— _

ral resources in or around the parks.
Salazar and President Barack Obama have
come under criticism for not allowing drill-
ing on federal lands, which include National
Parks. These natural resources could provide
energy independence from the Middle East.
And while energy independence is a
noble goal, the National Parks provide no
long-term solution to energy dependence.
We’d simply be risking the next generation’s
— our kids’ generation —~ enjoyment of
the National Parks, while also pushing the
eventual burden of energy independence

onto them.

For his part, Republican presidential can-
didate Mitt Romney has been characteristi-
cally vague about the fate of the'National
Parks — there isn’t one mention of them
on his ofﬁcial campaign website. But his
energy proposal released in August suggests
that many public lands would be placed un-
der control of the state governments, who,
strapped for cash, are far more likely to allow
drilling. The candidate admitted, “I don’t
understand why the federal government
owns so much of this land.”

Really? Have we gotten so caught up in
extravagant campaign rhetoric, shameful
politics and clever ways to turn a proﬁt that
we can’t even remember the importance of
basic conservation of the National Parks?

For those of us who will graduate with

too much debt and too little job opportunity,
the National Parks will provide a piece of
America that our families will enjoy too,
no matter our ﬁnancial strength or political
power. You don’t need an ofllshore bank
account or multi—million dollar corpora-
tion to enjoy the physical manifestations of
“America the Beautiful.”

Romney should know that. He once
reminisced, “We went from National Park
to National Park. And [my parents] were
teaching me to fall in love with America.”

The parks are howl fell in love with
America too, Mitt. And maybe someday I’ll
throw my kids in a fuel—efﬁcient SUV and
make a great road trip to one of the National
Parks. Maybe they, too, can fall in love with
America. ﬂ .

“Broadway in the ‘Burgh: Broadway
in the ’Burgh”

Frick Fine Arts Building Auditorium
Friday, Nov. 2, 9:15 pm.
Saturday, Nov. 3, 8 p.m.

_ NBC’s television production of “Smash” delves

into a chaotic mingling of the personal lives of
actors with the draining demands of producing
a smash Broadway musical, while also combin-
ing a Variety of themes into one show. '

In its annual variety show, the Pitt Musi-
cal’ Theatre Club tackles the same concept of
“Smash” in its own innovative way. The musi-
cal, “Broadway in the ’Burgh: Broadway in the
’Burgh,” is “about the making of a variety show,”
said Ethan Miller, the show’s director and co-
author of the musical’s script.

The musical “traces the creation of a variety
show from the ﬁrst Musical Theatre Club meet-
ing into writing it, casting it, putting it together,

and having it dramatically fall apart in front of .

everybody,” Miller said. ~
The forces that cause the play within a play
to crumble, however, are not the commonplace
dramas of aTV series. They are exclusive to the
cast and its chemistry as a group. :
“One of the reasons we decided to go with
this [script] is because as a group, we are very
good at making ﬁm of ourselves. Most of the

jokes in here are jokes thatwe make about our— 1

selves,” Miller said. .

' The screenplay — an original script by Mill-
er and club president Brian Pope — punctuates
songs from “Dreamgirls,” “[title of show] ,” “The
Producers” and “Cats.” _

One scene, for example, explores the re-
percussions and humor of a romance between
cast members. As a girl named Ginger (Hayley
White, a sophomore at Pitt) sits, deﬂated and
upset, bemoaning the ﬂaws inher relationship
with the hotshot of the cast, her peers crowd
around herwith feigned empathy. They work to
analyze the hotshot’s apparent disinterest, only

Play ‘smashes’ musicals to make original script —

to stumble upon an insincere, good-humored
guess that he is, perhaps, gay or was “turned”

‘ gay by another interested girl who seems to have

“that effect” on men. This idea prompts aseries
ofbanters where a broken-hearted Ginger pro-

I claims, “This isn’ta musical. You don’tfall in love

with people 10 minutes after you meet them!”

The witty, self-deprecating humor of the
musical makes it delightfully light—hearted, and
the written script is charmingly similar to the
repartee the castexchangés between scenes and
in every misstep of a chaotic rehearsal. This is
what sets “Broadway in the ’Burgh: "Broadway in

_ the ’Burg ” apart from theater cliches. I

Design: Arkane Studios
Publisher: Bethesda Softworks
PC, PS3, Xbox 360

Grade: B

Pros: Beautiful game world. The blink power
might be the coolest innovation in recent mem-
ory. Brutal combat. The freedom to choose.

Cons: Lackluster story. So-what ending.
Easy. - _

At its core, storytelling, be itthrough novels,
cinema orvideo games, has the powerto trans-
port its audience to another world. “Dishon-
ored,” Arkane Studios’ latest game published
by the much—celebrated Bethesda Softworls,

. is a vibrant example of a video game’s ability to

carry the player to an unfamiliar place.

Set in the ﬁctional industrial port city of
Dunwall, “Dishonored” places the player in
a steampunk—inspired fantasy world. At the
heart of this city’s economy is the‘ proﬁtable
production of whale oil, which powers many

of the cities mechanical parts. These whale oil-
powered mechanisms include security systems
and alarms, which, in the spirit of steampunk
worlds, contrast nicely with the swordplay and
flintlock weapons of Dunwall.

At the beginning ofthe game, the player ﬁnds
Dunwall in misery. A terrible plague spread by

rats, akin to the black death, infests the city. I

Corvo Attano, the protagonist, arrives home

after travelling abroad to seek aid for Dtmwall. -

Immediately upon arriving home, Corvo ﬁnds

: himself reporting his trip to the Empress of

Dunwall in the royal palace. Within the ﬁrst 15

minutes of the game, the Empress and'Corvo -

come under attackfrom assassins. The assassins
.murder the Empress and capture Corvo. Once
awake, Corvo, now imprisoned, quickly discov-
ers that the Empress’ murder was a conspiracy
within the government. The Lord Regent, alter
arranging the murder; places himself on the
throne in despotic rule.
The setup for the remainder of the game is
straightforward. Corvo, now working for the

. resistance movement in Dunwall, assassinates

his way through the government, eventually
working his way to the Lord Regent.

release ‘Dishonored’

Dunwall immediately draws the player into
its world. The artwork is spectacular and the
shell—shaded graphics are ﬂawless. The player
willfear the hordes of rats that scurry about the
game world for both the dangerous plague they
carry and their frightening ferocity. I

The main selling point of “Dishonored” isthe
player’s freedom to choose. Atthe beginning of
each mission, Corvo is given atarget. After this,
he is dropped off in the target’s vicinity. From

A there the player is free to pursue the target in

any way imaginable. One can attempt an invis-
ible approach, using sewers or rooftops to avoid
guards. Or, ifuninclined to stealth, players may
simply murder theirlway to the target. Both
combat and stealth are satisfying, but combat
is a far easier proposition.

The game’s ﬁrst weakness lies in the ease
withwhich the playercandispatch guards. While
the guards are equipped with a standard sword
and pistol, they seem entirely outmatched by
Corvo’s near-superhuman talents for violence.

But where the combat option lacks in_dif—
ﬁculty, the stealth alternative offers an inter-
esting challenge. This game is one of an elite

Bassnectar
drops beats
in Pittsburgh

Bassnectar

Monday,‘ Nov. 5 ‘
Stage AE, 7 p.m.
Admission: $32-$35
www.stageae.com

After selling out one of the city’s biggest concert I

venues more than a year ago, electronic music
sensation Bassnectarwill return to Pittsburgh,
bringing his unique hairstyle and drum beats to
the speakers of Stage AE.

The term electronic dance music brings
many things to mind, such as the “womp” of
dubstep and the catchy, upbeat sound of Swedish
house music. Much like most genres of music,
EDM has split into dozens of subgenres, each
with its own speciﬁc sound and legion of fans.

Then there is Bassnectar.

It might not be lyrics, but regardless, every
fan knows it by name: the drop. It stagts at the
beginning of the song: ‘amix of sounds forming

‘together to create a driving beat that pushes us

forward. At each turn, new sounds are added,
building anticipation for the excited listener.
Then, it happens. ,

Ifwe could see the sounds projectingthrough
the speakers, a concert by Bassnectar — the
stage name of artist Lorin Ashton—would look
like ‘a scene from one of George Lucas’ “Star
Wars” ﬁlms. There would be lasers shooting in
all directions as all—out chaos erupts across the
universe, sending shockwaves everywhere. OK,
so maybe Bassnectar’s music isn’t that epic, but
after listening to hit tracks like “Bass Head,”
you’ll see why fans describe his music as face-
melting. __ u « " 5

By merging the womp of dubstep, the fast-
paced tempo of “drum and bass” music, the
catchy European subgenre of trance gnd even
a little bitof metal into the mix, Bassnectar has

created agenre all his own. From drops to re— .

mixes of popular trackslike Ellie GouIding’s

V “Ligl1ts,”Bajssnectarhas amassedafanbasethat

seems to be able to handle anything the artist
throws at it —— including his hairstyle. V

While on stage, Bassnectar  does a
dance that most reserve for punk rock shows,
with his nearly waist—length hair wrapping
around  he rocks back and forth, shaking
his head from side-to-side. Those._dark brown

' dreadlocks that used to occtipy»Ba‘ssi1ectar’s

head were  calling card, a way to set the
DJ apart fromthe countless others who have
ﬂooded the fast-growing profession. And then

ALBUM REVIEW

Skipping Girl Vinegar makes

independent, stylistic music

Hannah Webb
Stcyj’ Wrz'ter.

Keep Calm, Carry The Monkey
Skipping Girl Vinegar

Grade: B .

Rocks like: Willy Mason

A dynamic quintet is slowly making its way
across the continents, catching the attention
of multiple major record labels. Despite the
opportunity to associate itselfwith a big name
in music, Skipping Girl Vinegar has chosen to

remain independent and create its own fame‘
 the help of their loyal fan base.

' {Keep Calm, Carry The Monkey was released

" independently on Oct. 22 and is a strong fol-

low—up from the band’s ﬁrst album, Siﬁ The
Noise. The new album adopts a more stylistic
approach, incorporating horn, banjo and string
instruments as well as a choir to complement
the members’ vocal harmony.

‘ Keep Calm, Carry The Monkey opens up with
abright and upbeat tracktitled “Chase the Sun,”
which gives its listeners an optimistic feeling

~ about the rest of the album.

A Mark Lang’s voice weaves the sunny weather
of his hometown, Melbourne, Australia, into his
lyrics, singing, “feel the spray off Buckley’s cave
and slip beneath the rock pool waves  in the
tide you will ﬁnd the things you hold inside.”

While “Chase The Sun” boasts a cheerful ‘
chorus with layered harmonies and acoustic.

chords, “You Can” is more restrained with an
expressive string accompaniment that applies
multiple sounds to one set of music. The album
closes with a strongﬁnale that graceﬁilly and co-
hesively blends sounds of piano and banjo. The
track itself is aptly named “Heart Does Ache”
on behalf of its poignant lyrics. °

The entire album shifts between choral pop, ,
alternative rock and folk, rendering an aura that V

is reminiscent of The Panics and Willy Mason.
The consistent shift in moods throughout the
album exempliﬁes the group’s free spirited.play—
fulness, which keeps its listeners constantly on
their toes. '

What sets Skipping Girl Vinegar apart from
other indie pop bands is the intimate storytell-
ing of its lyrics accompanied with harmonious
vocals that seem to personally involve the audi-
ence. Each song is heartfelt and representative
of Lang’s emotional journey —L atrue testament

. to the group’s talent. I

he cut them off.

Now, Bassnectar’s half-shaven, half—waist—
length hairstyle is an Internet sensation that
has spawned dozens of memes and even the
Twitter account @bassnectarshair. And his fan
base continues to grow, proving that even in a

superﬁcial industry like music, appearances V

aren’t everything.

As the latest stage of Bassnectar’s career un-
folds, the southern Californian DJ has once again
proven that he can push the limits and change
his style as he so chooses. Whether it’s his latest
single, “VavaVoom” —featuring Chicago emcee
Lupe Fiasco to continue the trend of allowing
hip—hop artists to invade his beats — or classics
like “Timestretch,” Bassnectar fans will applaud
and scream, waiting patiently for their favorite
artist to rework the genre he has pioneered. I

few —“Deus Ex: Invisible War,” for another
example ——~ in which it is possible to beat the
game without killing anyone. For every assas-
sination target, there is a nonlethal way to dis-

‘ patch him or her.

Blink, one of the greatest features of the
game, aids transportation via rooftops. Blink

is amagical powerthe player receives early inthe-

game, allowing him or her to instantly teleport

. a very short distance in any direction. Players

will ﬁnd themselves usingthis function not only
to achieve hard—to—reach heights, but also to
quickly approach targets and accomplish silent
kills. While Corvo has a host of supernatural
powers at his disposal, blink is the only one that
feels memorable, and it will surely be mimicked
by other games in the future.

Although Dunwall offers an incredibly en-
ticing world to fall into, “Dishonored” fails to
capitalize on the settingwith an equally engaging
story. The plot feels tired, and story conversa-
tions often seem simply like an excuse to send

Corvo somewhere to kill someone else.

The incredible power of choice “-Dishonored”
presents the player — stealth or violence — is
also mishandled. Depending on thebody count
at the end of the game, i.e., how stealthy the
player was, one of two endings  trigger. But
neither of these endings give pause to players,
asthey feel tacked on and unimportant. Despite
this, Dunwall is still noteworthy for its thought-

provoking political culture and plague—ridden

beauty.

“Dishonored” makes a rare attempt for video
games: an entirelyanew franchise. Butwhile Dun-
wall provides a fascinating new game world to
get lost in, the story of “Dishonored” leaves

- the player looking for satisfaction elsewhere.

The game play, too, creates a new brand for
the assassin genre. Witha unique ﬁrst-person
perspective, “Dishonored” sets itselfapart. But
just as the setting is undercut by the story, the
game play of “Dishonored” suffers because of
its lacking 

“Dishonored” will be remembered for its
new brand of game play and graphic style, but
its few shortcomings prevent itfrombecoming
a gaming classic. I

Musical communities help fight depression, lift spirits

Emily Horstman
WPTS Co7?.trz'butor

Let’s talk about depression.

It’s 38 degrees outside, the sun isjust
beginning its yearly trip into oblivion,
and ﬁnals are swiftly approaching. But
instead, think of enjoying» cupcakes mi-
crowaved in coffee mugs, sitting under
warm blankets, watching funny movies
with all your friends and smelling apple
cider. Unfortunately, when you’re feeling
down, it always manages to seem like

' those things are a lifetime away.

A one—man acoustic punk band out of
Virginia called Oklahoma Car Crash talks
about depression frequently —— that’s

’all he does, actually. The band’s musi-
cian, Nathaniel Brown, has created his

own tagline: “DIY musician, community "
, activist, ﬁghtingdepression one song

at a time.” Brown is just one man among
a larger movement of people who find
solace in community and song. The DIY
scene — a music culture closely associ-
ated with punk that stemmed from the
do-it—yourself work ethic — has become
an amazing network of bands in beat—up
vans who jump from house show to house
show across the U.S. and ﬁnd support
from the donation-based proceeds from
their concert attendees.

Oklahoma Car Crash provides an out-
let for Brown not only to cope with his
own depression and anxiety in a healthy
way, but to join a larger community of
music lovers with a tendency to catch
the blues. And that’s the part that’s most
important: community. Community is a
human necessity just as much as food,
water or warmth, but for some reason
we seem to have forgotten that.

Well, maybe not everyone has forgot-
ten. ‘

People like Brown have put their whole
lives’ work into making music, not mak-
ing money. Oklahoma Car Crash’s Band-
camp page describes the project as “not
for profit ... meaning all money made goes
towards releasing more music, none in
my pocket.” And all this to help inspire
others to find releases for depression
aside from self—injury or suicide. .

And apparently it’s working. ‘Since
2006, Brown, under theguise of Oklaho-
ma Car Crash, has released six albums and
EPs, all through Bandcamp or donation-
based record labels. .

The impact of projects like Oklahoma
Car Crash is twofold. On one hand, it has
the amazing ability to lead by example
and encourage people to be open about
what they’re experiencing. Brown’s latest
full-length album, “The Good War,” is an

  McCoy reaches endzone twice for hapless  in loss

J eremy- Tepper
Stqff Writer

Itwas a mediocre week for Pitt alum-
ni in the NFL, with no one managing
a signiﬁcant defensive contribution
and only one, LeSean McCoy, scoring
in’ the endzone. V

He scored two touchdowns,
extending the Pitt alumni’s longest

active touchdown streak to 27 NFL ,

games iri the process.

McCoy (Pitt 2007-2008) was
the top contributor among former
Panthers this week. The Philadelphia
Eagles running back found pay dirt
against the Atlanta Falcons ﬁrst on

a 2-yard run and then on a 7-yard
reception. On that day, he carried the
ball 16 times forits yards and hauled

‘ in three receptions for 22 yards.

It was a decent effort from Mc-
Coy, yet the Eagles lost their third
straight game by a score of 30-17.
If Eagles quarterback Michael Vick
continues to perform at_a mediocre
level, rookie Nick Foles could replace i
him. Look for McCoy to take on a
larger role in the Eagles’ offense if
this switch occurs. _ .

Besides McCoy, no other Pitt
alumnus has made signiﬁcant con-
tributions. ’ ,

LaRod Stephens"-‘Howling (Pitt

2006-2008) followed a strong ef-
fort in week 7 with a lackluster one.

After rushing for 104 yards against b

the Vikings Monday, the Arizona
Cardinals running back ran for only
eight yards on six carries against a-
tough San Francisco 49ers defense.
Stephens-Howling’s efforts were
slightly stronger through the air, as
he hauled in three receptions for 32
yards. He has taken the majority of
the team’s carries for the past two
weeks, with starters Beanie Wells and
Ryan Williams being injured.
Another Cardinal, LarryFitzger-
ald (Pitt'2o02—2oO3), also had apoor
day. The star receiver caught ﬁve

passes for just 52 yards. His statis-
tics from Monday’s game mark two
less-than-stellar weeks in a row for
Fitzgerald, who recordedamere 29
receiving yards last week. Fitzgerald
has struggled to ﬁnd a strong rap-
portwith backupjohn Skelton after
starter Kevin Kolb sat on the side-
lines the past two weeks with a rib
injury. With meager efforts coming
from two of their top contributors,
the Cardinals lost expectedly to the
Vikings, 24-3.

Kansas City receiverjon Baldwin
(Pitt 2008-2010) caught a single
pass for seven yards in his team’s‘
game against the Oakland Raiders

Sunday. He and the Chiefs droppefti‘
their fourth straight contest, losing
26-16 to the Raiders.

The Cleveland Browns won their
second game of the year, with defen-
sive end Jabaal Sheard (Pitt 2007-
2010) and the rest of the Cleveland»
defense holding the San Diego Char-
gers to only six points in the 7-6 vic-
tory. Sheard himself only made two
assisted tackles in the game, how-
ever. ‘

Andy Lee (Pitt ‘ 2ooo-2005.),
punted well in the 49ers’ win. The
Pro Bowl punter averaged 48.8 yards
on ﬁve punts. He pinned three punts
inside the 20-yard line. I

BARNES BURNER

Parity of NBA

“ff Nate Barnes

Suﬁ Writer

If there were ever a time to start following the
NBA, it’s now.
The 2012-2013 season began Tuesday
night with six teams in action, including the
defending-champion Miami Heat and the
reloaded Los Angeles Lakers, who acquired
future hall of famers Dwight Howard and Steve
Nash in the offseason. —

The NBA is certainlypa star-driven league,
and team play is crucial to championship-
caliber teams. But with only ﬁve players on the
ﬂoor, basketball lends more talented players a
greater chance to single-handedly impact the
game’s proceedings than any-other team sport.

And this year, with the stars aligned in
Miami and Los Angeles, sports fans are in for

-gghat could likely be the most exciting season
ever played in the league.

But the load of talented teams involved +
the Heat, Lakers, Oklahoma City Thunder,
Boston Celtics and San Antonio, Spurs among
them — arenft what will make this season one
of the Association’s best ever.

There are great teams every year, but that
doesn’t necessarily make a great season for
fans. Take the 2006-2007 season: The Spurs
team that beat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the
ﬁnals will go down as one of the best in league

history, but the overall quality of the league

:vr-~.;_--

     
   

November i, 2012 l The Pitt News I \/\/\/\/\/\/.plllﬂ€3WS.COm

that season was very poor.

As the 2012-2013 season begins, the league
resides at the opposite end of the spectrum,
with a high level of parity —— and that’s what
will make the NBA great this year.

Granted, the Lakers and Heat will probably
meet in the ﬁnals this season. But with this
depth of talent, there are very few teams one
can eliminate from postseason contention at
the outset as in years past. Of the 30 teams in
the league, the only two teams that certiﬁably
have no chance of making the postseason are
the Charlotte Bobcats and Orlando Magic.

, Better yet, there are a number of teams
with the potential to break out this season.
Here are three to watch as the year progresses.
Golden State Warriors '
2011-2012 record: 23-43, 13th in West

The one thing Golden State was good at 9

last season was shooting 3—pointers, which
they made at a league-leading rate of 38.8
percent. Beyond that, there was no reason
to pay attention to the Warriors.
Defensively, they were one of the worst
‘overall units, allowing 101.2 points per game

. while their opposition shot 49.6 percent from

the ﬁeld. The Warriors ended the year with
a point differential of--3.4 points per game.
The bay area squad’s season was derailed
very early on because of player injuries, most
notably that of their star guard Stephen Curry,
who played in only 23 games.

But this season they have the chance to
develop into a playoff team as a part of the
hyper- competitive Western Conference. Curry
is healthy, and the team is deeper overall than
it hasbeen in recent memory. Golden State’s
likely starting lineup of Curry, Klay Thomp-
son, Harrison Barnes, David Lee and Andrew

Bogut can go toe-to—toe with just about any

other unit in the league.
Sacramento Kings .
2011-2012 record: 22-44, 14th in West

The Kings, another team from northern
California, were nothing to write home about

last season. ‘But they have stockpiled young.

talent fora few years now, and their efforts
should start to pay dividends this season.
Sacramento is led by Tyreke Evans, one of
the league’s most dynamic young perimeter
players. Flanking Evans onthe perimeter will
be Marcus Thornton 4- Sacramento’s leading
scorer from last year at 16.5 points per game
—- and Isaiah Thomas, who garnered some
Rookie of the Year discussion with his aver-
ages_of 11.5 points and 4.1 assists per game.
At the post, DeMarcus Cousins established
himself as one of the league’s top players in his
position by averaging a double-double of 18.1
points and 11 rebounds per game last season.

.At power forward, the super-athletic Jason A

Thompson put up 9.1 points and 6.9 rebounds

_ per game while shooting at 53.5 percent —— the

bestrate of hiscareer.

teams makes this season intriguing

Joining Sacramento’s established post play-
ers will be ﬁrst-round draft choice Thomas
Robinson, and no one should be surprised if
he pushes for playing time at the small and
power forward spots.

Detroit Pistons
2011 record: 25-41, 10th in East

Like the Kings, the Pistons have built up
a lot of young talent for the past three years.
Last year, the league saw some ﬂashes of this
potential in the performances of then-rookie
guard Brandon Knight and 26-year-old Rod-
ney Stuckey. Stuckey, who scored 14.8 points
per contest last season, and Knight — 12.8
points, 3.8 assists per game — will return to
lead the Pistons in the backcourt.

5:

The main story of the 2011-2012 season i

for Detroit was break-out star Greg Monroe,
who put up a double-double on a near-nightly
basis. Monroe posted 15.4 points and 9.7 re-
bounds per game, and he should play even
better this season as he continues to develop
into an elite power forward.

Flanking Monroe at center this season
willbe the_Pistons’ No. 9 overall draft selec-
tion,.Andre Drummond. The starting center
position is wide open, so Drummond should
contribute immediately while anchoring the
paint. Fellow rookies Khris Middleton, Kim
English and Kyle Singler should also see time
on the ﬂoor and add scoring punch off the
bench. I l
