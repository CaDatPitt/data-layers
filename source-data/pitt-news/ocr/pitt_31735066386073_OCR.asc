Tuition bike near—certain; faculty raises in danger

By Jennifer Calabrese
Senior Sta_[]‘W1°iter

It is likely that some of the
burden of a possible Pitt budget
deficit will fall on students in the
form of a $229 tuition increase
next year.

“At this point it seems that a lot
of the responsibility for balancing
the budget will fall on the students.
Considering that we are a public
university and part of our mission
is to provide affordable education,
these increases year after year
seems to put a damper on that
mission,” Student Government
Board President Julie Shepard
said. .

The expected increase has
many students wondering how
they will deal with paying a higher

tuition bill.

“As it is, lam barely getting by.
lftuition goes up that high I don’t
know where l’ll come up with
the money,” said Louis
Blackmond, junior.

Expectations of the higher
tuition came after last week's
passing ofthe Pennsylvania state
budget, which includes Pitt’s
appropriation. While Governor
Robert Casey’s recommended
state budget could have thrown
Pitt into a $12 million deficit, the
amended budget offers some
relief by allowing Pitt to raise
tuition for full—time in—state
students by 6 percent (5229).
This increase would raise tuition
from $3,820 to $4,049 for two
semesters. Tuition increases for
part-time and out-of-state students

will be determined separately.

“This won’t bother me if my
financial aid covers it, but if it
doesn’t then it will have to come
out of my own pocket. I don’t see
why the university couldn’t find
another way to get money, like
fundraising," said]oAnne Meyer,
junior.

Pitt has been expecting a low
state appropriation since Casey
released his budget in February.
Though Pitt requested a $147.‘)
million appropriation, Casey
recommended that the university
receive $133.5 million. In
anticipation of that budget, Pitt
president Wesley Posvar instituted
a hiring f reeze and recently began
mandating cuts in athletics, the
president’s office staff and
maintenance and repairs.

The 6—percent tuition increase
still qualifies Pitt for the
Governor's Tuition Challenge
Grant, which originally gave $100
per student to schools that keep
tuition raises under Sl()() per
student. Pitt leaders asked the
legislattr re to change the program
to include a percent-based cap
and succeeded in swaying the
lawmakers to allow them to raise
tuition 6 percent under the
program.

Pitt’s Board of Trustees will
have to approve any tuition hike
when they vote on the total
university budget onjuly 23. In a
statement released on July 3,
Posvar said that “|Pittl along with

Wichita State‘
official to head
Student Affairs

By Milt Klopfer
Senior Staﬂ Writer

Pitt officials are eagerly awaiting the August 20
arrival of William W. Harmon, the newly named
vice president for Student Affairs.

College of Arts and Sciences Dean Mary Briscoe,
chairperson of the committee that selected the new
vice president, said that Harmon’s current position
as associate vice president for Student Affairs and
Dean of University College at The Wichita State
University in Wichita, Kansas, make him uniquely
qualified to address both academic and service
issues of student life.

“lThe search committee was] impressed by his
expertise, his wisdom, his concern for students and
his understanding of key issues of student affairs,”
Briscoe said. '

According to Briscoe, Harmon’s position at Wichita
State University involves responsibility for both
academic and student-service programs. Briscoe
believes that I-larmon’s experiences would enable
him to “interact with those concerned with students
on both academic and student-service sides.”

Harmon told T bePitt News that one of his general
goals will be “making sure there is a positive
relationship between student affairs and academic,
affairs.”

Harmon is also concerned with ensuring the
successful transition of new college students to
university life and interaction within a diverse
campus population.

“There is a [University of California at Los Angelesl
study that shows that more students have
participated [in student activities] prior to college
[than duringl," said Harmon. “One problem is
maintaining student interest. Some become very
focused on the academic aspect of school. A

diversity of activities prevents burnout [in the

studentl.”

Harmon will be aided in his efforts by the current
interim vice president for Student Affairs, Dennis E.
Donham, who will become assistant vice president
in August.

“I think he’s a very friendly guy,” said Donham.
“I think in some ways we’ll have fun. He's very
approachable and accessible."

Freshman George Klimis makes a Pitt stop at the opening of the Pitt Shop.

University unveils new Pitt Sloop

Byjim Tezak
News Editor

The university opened its new Pitt
Shop on Monday and got rave reviews
from the first few customers.

“I was surprised. I was looking for the
University Shop,” said Ron Minnich,
whose daughter is at Pitt this week for
her advising session. “lThis store] is
really nice; it's a really nice line lof
merchandisel."

The store is located on 393‘) Forbes
Avenue, the site of the old University
Shop. Pitt decided last February not to
renew the lease of University Shop
ownerjay McKenzie because it wanted
to open its own souvenir store.

The University Shop had been a
mainstay in Oakland for 29 years, but
new Pitt Shop supervisor Dennis
Crovella said he hopes that won’t deter
people from shopping in his store.

“I wasn’t here when that decision was
made. I didn’t have anything to do with
decisions made in the past. My job is to
manage the store for the university," he
said. “I would hope that most alumni
would want to support their school."

Minnich, from Lykens, Pa., was one
customer who was glad to see the
university open its own store.

He said, “I get out here every year. I
would see a better line of merchandise
back in the Harrisburg area than here.
Not now. I'm going to guarantee you're
going to make a fortune here.

“It’s definitely a plus for the university.
The University of Pittsburgh can be
proud of this.”

‘‘It’s very nice. 'lhere’s a lot of stuff,"
said Ken Smelt’/.er, a freshman at his
advising session who had never seen
the original University Shop. ,

liven some Pitt old-timers forgot about

‘the University Shop once they got a

look at Crovella’s store.

“I'm just window shopping, lbutl it
looks like they have a better selection,"
said Pitt senior Dave Baum.

Crovella said that while the store
sells only University of Pittsburgh
licensed items, he hopes he has
merchandise that appeals to a variety
of groups. He also said the store will
eventually have a mail-order service,

The tuition increase will only
provide some relieftt > Pitt’s budget
problems. The possibility of cuts
in faculty and staff salary raises
also has some Pitt employees
w()rried. Recently the llniversity
Senate passed a resolution urging
the administration to increase
faculty salaries by 7.5 percent,
but Oxanna Kaufman, I,‘-niversity
Senate secretary, said that those
raises may be in jeopardy.

“liven with the tuition increase,
we are still going to be about $10
million in the hole. I am dubious
that we will get the lincreasel,"
said Kaufman.

Any raises that are given to
faculty will be paid in September,

In a communal melting pot
such as the University of
Pittsburgh campus, it can be
expected that with the variety of
personalities, persuasions and
preferences, incoming students
may not be equipped to deal
with the diversity of people on
campus.

At Monday evening's
multicultural video program
shown to new Pitt students, the
segment highlighting the
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance on campus was inaudible
due to whistling,’ giggling and
murmuring by some of the
audience members.

“This group seemed to be very
homophobic,” said Student
Government Boa rd Presidentjulie
Shepard. According to Shepard,
the attitude among the new
students seemed to be “Gee, I
didn’t expect ‘them’ to be here or
to be this outgoing." S

Brenda Pardihi, coordinator of
New Student Programs, said the
whole point of the video was to
show that negative attitudes
toward any. people are
unacceptable.‘ She said the
disturbance was confined to one
area, but that she couldn’t hear
any specific slurs.

“This was the first group that
had any noise. There was a rise in
talking, and then it died; it was
like a crescendo," she said. Pardini
said there is no specific follow-
up program to deal with students

Ooz/elcmd Real Estate detbrones Kings Court

By Leslie Mcswain
Sla_(]' Writer

Oakland's only movie theater,
Kings Court, will be showing its
last movie next Thursday.

The 25-year lease held by
Cinemaworld Incorporated has
just ended, and a new lease was
not able to be agreed upon.

The theater's manager, Steve
Mahofski, said, “There was a

problem with the lease and lease

negotiations. Movie theaters
traditionally can only afford to
pay so much rent, and since the
lease was 25 years old, the rent
was gorxi, very good. But
Cinemaworld lnc. could not reach
an amicable agreement with
Oakland Real Fstate, who owns
the property.”

. Oakland Real listate official Mr.
Schwartz emphasized that lease
negotiations were friendly despite
the fact that an agreement was
not reached. l le could not disclose
who was seeking to lease the
property, but said various people
had expressed interest.

“We are open to lease it as a
theater or another type of
building. We are actively seeking
tenants [who] would be
compatible with the
neighborhood," said Schwartz.

Schwartz stated that TCBY, who
subleases from the theater, will
stay and lease directly from his
company. I le added that the space
above the theater, previously a

gameroom, will be leased as
office space.
inside, the building has

changed noticeably over the
years, but the exterior has
remained the same. “The front
facade has been this way forever,
and was based on a castle motif.
This used to be an old police ﬁre
station and the auditorium was
the stables,” said Mahofski.
Oakland Real l-Estate hopes to
keep the exterior the same. “We
spent a lot of money about two
years ago repainting the outside.
We had it cleaned and painted.
We also put a new roof over the
auditorium, so the whole building
is in good shape,” said Schwartz.

The original theater 25 years
ago was an artsy roadshow house
with genuine antique decorations,
including a glass chandelier and
a china closet. The movies shown
were those that were touring from
city to city.

“Roadshows sort of faded out
of vogue in the early 705. They
started to make a lot of rock
movies.l7beRocleyllorrorPicture
Sbowl came out. Little by little
they got the decor out of here
before it was destroyed," said

I Mahofski.

According t() Mahofski, the
closing of the theater was a little
surprising. “We intended to stay
in Oakland. We hoped to stay in
Oakland. We were disappointed
when the negotiations resulted

this way. We didn’t expect to,

close at this point. Of course, we
knew there was the possibility,
but we thought for certain that
we would be here a little longer.”

Cinemaworld is relocating
some of the employees of King's
Court, according to Mahofski.
“Some of us are going to other
places and some of us aren't. I
was reassigned to Southland
Nine. We had one person
transferred to the Manor already.
One other person is supposed to
talk to the Denis and another to
the Bellview.”

Schwartz is not sure when new
tenants will be taking over, but
hopes for it to be sometime in the
coming months.

retroactive to July. Shepard said
that a lack of salary increases
could hurt the quality of a
student's education.

“You cannot promote a high-
quality institution if you can’t get
quality faculty by offering them
competitive salaries,” she said.

Philip Wion, president of the
United Faculty, pointed out that
faculty salaries are already below
the average of other schools in

the American Association of’

Universities and therefore should

 

be given high priority.

“It should be clear to the
university that we are in the fourth
year of “a” plan to try to bring
salaries up to par and therefore
they should try to meet [the salary
increases]. There are other ways
of dealing with the financial
difficulties,” he said.

Wion also said that budget

problems could affect class sizes
and therefore the quality of
instruction at Pitt.

“if limiting positions is one of
the primary ways that is used lto
balance the budgetl then there is
likely to be a direct increase in
class size and therefore on the

quality of education,” said Winn.

with prejudices; however, she
said as students continue to attend
the university, education will
break down some of these walls.

Mentor Alicia Smith said that
during discussion about the video,
students expressed surprise.
“They said, ‘I don't believe they’re
that open.’ I don't think that it
was the fact that they were so
anti-homosexual. I think it was
the fact that they were just
shocked to see that and just didn't
understand.”

Randy Legersky, a new student
attending the program as part of
her advising session, said,
“People’s lack of contact with
homosexuals and other minority
groups in general" was why the
disruption occurred.

“A lot ofthese kids are coming

from schools where they've been
protected, sheltered from the real
world," he said. “When they came
here and lsaw this video], they
were shocked by seeing a group
that they’ve never encountered
before out in the open."
Following the video, facilitators
broke the students into groups to
talk about the film. Legersky

added that people in his group
ranged in their opinions about

gays and lesbians. He said that.

some questioned the motives of
“coming out of the closet," while
others expressed what they would
do if they had a gay or lesbian
roommate.

PSU combats campus bigotry

By Mark Smith
stag Wruer

A major goal for multicultural education is the creation of
college courses which reflect more than one people’s history.

With this in mind, Penn State University’s faculty senate
approved a motion in April to promote educational diversity.
According to Jerry Covert, assistant dean of undergraduate
education at PSU, a Steering Committee report for a more
inclusive education at Penn State is due July 27.

Over the last couple of years, gay bashings and racially
motivated violence has created a tense situation at the school.
A proposed diversity requirement is Penn State's attempt to
challenge racism, homophobia and sexism on campus. Rather
than a specific “diversity” class, the Steering Committee is
expected to release a report recommending the implementation
of curriculum integration as well as the diversity requirement.

For example, a student would be able to fulﬁll the requirement
by selecting from one of many different courses in various
departments. In returmdepartments will begin to offer many
different types of courses. Students will also be able to fill the
requirement by choosing from black, Hebrew and women’s
studies. .

Covert agrees that something must be done to challenge
campus bigotry. He claims homophobia is the least understood
prejudice and states thatit is “most rampant” on Penn State’s
campus. This action by the university will begin to challenge all
prejudice. A

  Mandatory incompetence fee

Because of a low state budget appropriation and the
possibility of a nearly S10 million university—l)udget
deficit, Pitt students can probably look forward to a $229
tuition increase this year.

Despite a decrease in the quality of education due to
increasing enrollment, low faculty salaries and the hiring
freeze, Pitt students will be expected to pay a higher
tuition.

As Student Government Board Presidentjulie Shepard
pointed out, providing an affordable education is supposed
to be one ofthe principles ofa public university. Yet it is
a struggle for many Pitt students to pay the current tuition,
which is the highest of any Pennsylvania state-related
university. '

On top of the tuition increase, students will have to pay
the SI l() computer fee, doubled from last year.

Instead of forcing the burden of the deficit upon the
shoulders of the students, the university administration
should have carefully evaluated the budget situation and
begun making the necessary cutbacks last year.

The tuition increase could have been $23 — a tenth of
the proposed increase —— had our administrators been
more prudent with our funds.

llere’s how:

There are approximately l7,00() full-time, in—state
undergraduate students attending Pitt. The revenue from
the proposed 8229 tuition increase for these students will
be about S3,893,()()(). Through irresponsibility and poor
judgement, Pitt administrators have lost at least 83.5
million. _

[Earlier this year area resident Lou Meyers donated $2.5
million to Point Park —— money that would have been
given to Pitt had the administration returned his phone
calls. The university threw an additional million away in
the hasty decisions to extend contracts to mediocre
football coaches Poge Iia’/.io and Mike Gottfried. Pitt

' students are now stuck paying off ‘lifetime contracts.’

These 535 million mistakes could have provided the
bulk of the funds that are now being demanded from the
students. The $393,000 balance would have amounted to
a $23 increase in tuition for full-ti me in—state undergraduate
students.

While students struggle to come up with the additional
tuition money, the administration bungles with its academic
mission. I

To a Pitt administrator yanking us for hundreds of
thousands of dollars in salary the extra 5206 probably
doesn’t mean much. But to a student working a minimum
wage job to keep paying the rent, those mistakes mean
51.5 hours of work.

And for what? “Sorry, that class is already closed...”

A long, strange, non-violent trip

I don ‘t want those Deadenders
ever back again. The group is
fine, but those people who follow

them around are not.
Mayor Sophie Masloff

7hey‘re here!
Poltergeist: The Movie

A year after Pittsburgh police
made headlines for their “near”-
brutal treatment of Grateful Dead
fans, the Dead returned to our
golden city to give a sizzling
performance at Three Rivers
Stadium. Following many other
musical artists’ recent trials and
tribulations, this year’s show was
also immersed in contrived
controversy.

Where most artists who perform
in Pittsburgh are required to pay
$18,000 for security (and the city
amusement tax), this year the
Dead were required to front city
officials $54,000 —— three times as
much as anyone else. With
Florida’s blatant censorship of 2
Live Crew, the city of Pittsburgh's
outrageous pre-show price was
yet another attempt, albeit thinly
disguised, of musical censorship.
Charge enough money and
maybe the band won't return.
Intimidate fans with increased
security and maybe they won't
come to the show. ,

So why all the hype? Are the
band’s songs full of obscenities
and sexually degrading lyrics?
I)oes the band promote any sort
of violence? Do they leave a
crowd angry and incensed? A
most resounding NO! So what is

it, Mayor Masloff?

It is simply the carnivalesque
troupe of gypsies, known as
Deadheads, who follow the band
who provoked all of this
ridiculous fear on the part of city
officials. It was the people with
long hair wearing patchouli oil
and donning tie-dyed T-shirts that
said “Save the Rain forests" who
frightened police into attending
the second evening of last year’s
concert in full riot gear.

There are drugs and alcohol at
events other than Dead shows
which draw crowds as large as
this band does — like the Rolling

  Jessica
Coville

Stones, the Who, and the
Pittsburgh Penguins, Pirates and
Steelers. But a group as
“identiﬁable” as the Deadheads
gives officials a relatively easy
target for their paranoia. One
police official remarked that the
only time LSD and mushrooms
come into town is when the
Grateful Dead are playing. Come
on, be realistic.

(However, we'll let Pittsbu rgh’s

infamous China White designer .

drug casually slip away from
everyone’s minds and look the
other way at all the cocaine at
sporting events in town. But the
Dead? We have to protect the
children. ...)

So did Masloffs veiled, threats
work? Did the band and its fans
put their tails -between their legs
and shirk away from Pittsburgh?
Did the attempt of censorship
work? Thankfully, it did not.

With weather in the low '90s

0 (some with field seats would

argue that it was near 104 degrees)
and a crowd of 46,000, the concert
was a huge success. Of all who
attended, there were only 150

- arrests, mostly for alcohol and

narcotics charges. Considering
the number of attendants, this
number was relatively low. Even
with the stringent parking rules
and no camping allowed within
the city limits, fans seemed to be
quite content and “well-behaved. "

The difference this year was
that the city did provide a larger
area for the performers and fans,
and police were not in riot gear
holding down Deadheads and
kicking them with steel-toed
boots. Even Police Chief Mayer
Deroy was pleased with the day's
festivities, saying that it was an
enjoyable night for all.

So Ms. Masloff et—al, hopefully
the next time you decide to send
police in riot gear to an event in
the city, you will learn something
from this year’s Dead show: When

you go someplace expecting a ,

fight, that might just be what you

get. And when you treat people‘

as human beings and not animals,
then most likely that is the same
attitude you will see in return.

Letter: how gays become pregnant

I encourage everyone to follow
the suggestion that Mark Smith
made in his [column], which was
printed on June 13, 1990, “Get
your facts straight, Luksik,” which
asked people to READ. [...l

After doing some reading, Mark
and others will discover that
population controllers, such as
Planned Parenthood, have
promoted homosexuality as one
form of birth control for many
years. Another is masturbation,

which modern sexologists call
"outercourse." _

One other pointthat I would
like to clarify for Mr. Smith, who
obviously misunderstood my use
of the qualifying word, usually,
in a statement that I wrote in the
excellent Christian newspaper,
Expression “after all,
homosexuals don't usually
become pregnant," is that I
recognize that a significant
number of homosexuals are

lesbians. Lesbians can and do
sometimes have intercourse with
males and they can and sometimes
do become pregnant. Also, a
growing number of lesbians are
making use of artificial
insemination and in vitro
fertilization, which use male
donor sperm, so they and their
female partners can have children

Merger Mania: Pitt ponders football conference

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

Ever since Penn State joined
the Big 10 Conference, it seems
that every university in the country
has become interested in
conference re-alignment; a.k.a.
“Merger Mania.” And Pitt is no
exception.

Pitt is currently one of eight
schools with an invitation to join
the Metropolitan Collegiate
Athletic Conference (Metro).

While the final formal
groundwork has not been
presented, Pitt’s athletic

‘department has attended several
meetings with Metro officials to
further clarify the details involved
in this potential new relationship.

“We have been involved in
looking at anything that could
involve an option for us
something that would give us the
opportunity to be involved in a
football conference; and yet our
priority is also to maintain our
conference affiliation with the
Big East inour other sports,” said
Pitt’s associate director of athletics

Dean Billick.
“We have had several
discussions with the Metro,

Uneventful World Cup

By Sean Heilman
saw‘ Writer

The World Cup in Italy was
completed this past weekend with
West Germany winning its third
title over Argentina, 10, in a
rematch of the 1986 final.

But this year's World Cup was
one of the sloppiest in history.. It
has created much talk among
FIFA (International Soccer

Federation) about new rules to '

have a safer, higher-scoring game,
especially since the next World
Cup in 1994 is coming to the
United States. The new rules
implemented for cleaner play
during this world championship
only caused players to be

penalized more often and harshly
for simple fouls.

“There was questionable
refereeing in the whole
tournament," Pitt soccer coach
Joe Luxbacher said. “But there
are always going to be mistakes
in refereeing. I don’t think it
affected the ﬁnal. But they were
giving yellow cards for new
things. FIFA changed the rule to
make it much more lenient to
give a yellow card, and players
ended up being ejected and
suspended.”

A player is ejected if he receives
two yellow cards in a game, and
suspended one game if he
accumulates two yellow cards
over a period of two games.

including meetings. 'l'hey are
having another meeting this
month where we will be in
attendance," Billick said.

The Metro proposal as it
currently stands fits in quite well
with the goals Billick and the Pitt
athletic department want to
accomplish by joining a
conference. The eight member
schools which comprise the Metro
would be joined by eight outside
universities to comprise a 16-
member conference. llowever,

Billy Osborn was a versatile
athlete when he played for
Pitt. He was a wide receiver
in football, a guard on the
basketball team and a center
fielder for the baseball team.

It’s been two years since
Osborn graduated from Pitt,
finishing 11th on Pitt’s all
time receiving list for yards
and 12th in receptions, and
now he’s playing the most
versatile role of his career.

Osborn is now both a wide
receiver and defensive back
for the Pittsburgh Gladiators
in the Arena Football League.
Defense isn't new to Osborn,
who was an All-State
defensive back at Wildwood
(N.}.) High School. ,

“I played defensive back and
that’s what I was recruited at
for most of my schools. I
played two years at Pitt. So it
wasn’t that big of an
adjustment.”

In four games with the
Gladiators this year, Osborn
has two tackles, two assists,
and two pass deflections.
Gladiator head coach Joe
Haering is pleased with
Osborn’s play.

“He's a new player and is
very intelligent," he said.

in football only while West
Virginia, Miami, Temple and
Rutgers would participate in all
sports. Thus, the Big liast schools
could continue to operate in the
Big East conference in certain
sports without a full athletic
obligation, to the Metro.

The Metro has not participated
in football in the past, but would
become a football conference in
the future, pending the outcome
of their proposal.

With the slew of proposals
facing different universities as
conference re—alignment gets into
high gear, Billick feels the Metro

“lle picks things up well and
has done a really good job
defensively, he hasn’t been

Osborn knows
importance of defense. “The
big thing in this league is
don’t get beat deep,” he said.
“There are a lot of angles in
this league, so you have to be

the

in the right place, because
things happen so much
quicker."

Osborn didn’t actually play
two full seasons of defensive
back at Pitt. He was switched
to wide receiver during
spring drills of his freshman
year. He went on to lead the
team in receiving in 1986
with 33 receptions for 414
yards. He continued playing
offense in his junior and
senior seasons and was
looking forward to playing in
the NFL.

His goal was deterred,
however, when he broke his
collar bone against N. C. State
in the second-to—last game of
his senior year. He wasn’t
drafted, but in 198‘) he signed
as a free agent with the
Philadelphia Eagles. He never
played a down in the NFL, as a
hernia kept him on the
disabled list most of the year,
and was let go at the end of the
season.

"l:\letro’sl proposal is probably
the farthest along,” Billick said,
"and later this summer I think
they will put a concrete proposal
on the table. In all probability, ll
assume they'll put a timetable on
it, and we’ll have to make a
decision."

As more schools, specifically
athletic independents, consider
joining different conferences, the
situation will pose various
problems for those schools who
wish to remain independent. The
first problem concerns television

of defense in arena ball forced
Osborn to change his style of

“You play a lot of man-to-

Osborn. “When your in man-

may initiate future rule changes

“FIFA was trying to clean up
the play, but I don’t think it
worked. They were giving yellow
cards for fouls that weren’t bad."

F IFA has made several changes
in rule interpretations, effective
July 25, to try to open up the
offenses. The most notable
change was made in ‘ the
interpretation of the offsides rule.
An attacker no longer has to be
behind the next-to-last defender
when the ball is passed. The
attacker is now permitted to be
even with the last defender.

ltalia ’90 was the lowest scoring
World Cup ever and the first
championship game shut-out,
making for one of‘ the least
exciting World Cups in history.

Five of the games were decided
on penalty kicks. The World Cup
has become lower scoring since
it began in 1930. The change in
the offsides interpretation may
affect American college play. The
NCAA plays by the United States
Soccer Federation rules, which
vary slightly from FIFA.

“I assume they will change it in
college,” said Luxbacher. “They
are hoping for more scoring. It
could lead to more breakaway
type of plays. But we’ll see.
Defenses always seem to adjust."
Luxbacher feels the evolution in
the style of play over the years
has caused soccer to be lower
scoring.

“When you have the top

defenders back and you have
them packed back there, it is
tough to score. There is so much
pressure not to lose [in the World
Cupl. Teams are playing not to
lose instead of to win. Brazil
probably is more talented than
Argentina, but they weren’t in the
final [Argentina beat Brazil in the
second round 1-0] and neither
were the Dutch. Their attacking
style is pleasing to see, but the

defensive teams are getting
through.” -7
Another controversy which

FIFA will have to address is how

to decide tie games. Both

semifinals went to penalty kicks.

Basketball in the United States
is made up of changing rules,
foreign players and great athletes
on both the college and
professional level.

It's a sport that young Americans
are used to playing year-round.

But things are different in
France. Children play only if they
have time outside their school
work, which allows for a kid to
concentrate on only one sport.

The French also have different
rules and are accustomed to
playing in a more physical style.

About 60 French kids showed
that style in this country at the Pitt
Lady Panther basketball camp
June 29 —July 6.

The French squad, coached by
Roger Tank, general manager of
Nanci, a club team in France, was
made up of girls under age 18
and teams ofboys and girls under
age 15 who played at Fitzgerald
Field I-louse againstsimilarly-aged

stars from the Pittsburgh area put
together by the Pittsburgh
Summer Basketball League in
cooperation with the Greater
Pittsburgh Boys and Girls Clubs
of America.

It is the fourth year in a row
Tank has brought students to the
United States to play basketball.
It is all part of an educational
camp devised by Tank himself

Pittsburgh was the French
team's first stop. They were also
scheduled to travel to Marietta
and Tiffin, both in Ohio, for
basketball camps, and visit places
such as Niagara Falls and Cedar
Point in Sandusky, Ohio.

Tank is very busy year-round
developing players. As the general
manager of Nanci, he is
responsible for acquiring and
developing players for 21 teams
in the Nanci organization from
the age of four up to the
professional Division 1 level.

Basketball is becoming very
popular in France and, for that
reason, the French have invented

ways to develop players from the
youngest of ages.

“Basketball is becoming the
No. 2 sport in France,” said Tank.
“Fifty-ﬁve percent of the people
say they watch soccer, and 45
percent say they are looking for
basketball.”

Tank said soccer is an easy
sport for kids to play at any age
to help them develop into great
athletes, but basketball is harder.
A 4-year-old cannot pick up a
basketball and put it in the hoop.

“Everybody starts with soccer, ”
he said. “It is easy to play soccer
with a Coke can or whatever. So
we invented baby basketball. You
can start when you are 4 years
old. We have a special ball that is
very light and will bounce
anywhere. You can play on the
beach, on grass, everywhere.”

Baby basketball consists of one
hoop in the middle of a 360-
degree circular area. The hoop is
adjustable to the size of the
players, who are normally 4 to 7
years old. The kids play in the
circular area and shoot for the
goal. Play is restarted, or in-
bounded, after each score from
outside of the circular area

“In baby basketball, anyone
can slam dunk,” Tank said. “A lot
of kids learn the game that way.
It is possibly a way to fight against
soccer."

But why would there be an
attempt to displace a popular
sport like soccer which has a rich
tradition in France? Tank said it is

not a matter. of displacingsoccer,-we 

but in France, kids cannot play a
number of sports. V A

“In France, we have'to' make a
decision. These kids have 42
hours of school a week. When
they become 18 or 19, they must
decide whether to go to college
or play a sport. Most kids choose
school," Tank said.

scores were 1-1, 4-3 on penalty
kicks. There have been a number
of suggestions, including sudden
death or replay the game, but for
now, penalty kicks is the best
way to decide a game, even
though it does not necessarily
decide which team is better.

“The old way [in U.S. college
soccer] was to count the number
of corner kicks a team had in a
game," said Luxbacher. “I don't
like that rule, [except] if there
was some way to award the team
which is attacking the most."

What about sudden-death
overtime?

“Sudden death would be great,
but it could go on for five days,”
Luxbacher exaggerated.

“They used to replay a tie game
[on the international level]. But
because of television they had to
put the game in a specific amount
of time and they went to penalty
kicks.

“If I had a choice, I would
replay it. But if they don’t replay
it, they have to find some way to
award the team that’s trying to
attack.”

FIFA has never taken such a
close look at its game. Soccer has
remained relatively the same for
hundreds of years. But FIFA is
trying to gain American interest.
The U.S., although it is one of the
strongest youth soccer countries,
has remained third world when
it comes to the world’s most

will now be reality, FIFA wants
the game to appeal to American
sports fans. Soccer probably will
not replace baseball, football or
basketball, but there certainly is
room for it among the traditional
American sports.

“FIFA has to do something to
spice up games. I’m not saying
change the game because the
game is great as it is. I enjoyed the
Cup. I thought it was a great
series. It’s just that they are trying
to attract new spectators.
Americans can't appreciate a 0-0
tie. Plus some of the other things
like the Argentina players going

But just because most kids go
on to school instead of playing
basketball on scholarship
somewhere, that doesn’t mean
they do not take basketball
seriously.

As general manager of Nanci,
Tank is seriously involved with
basketball on the European level.
European basketball is governed
by FIBA (International Basketball
Federation), which implies
different rules than American
college and professional
basketball. Some differences are:
a wider lane, the three-point line
(halfway between the college and
pro lines), the shot clock (30
seconds) and the-procedure of
in-bounding the ball.

Under FI BA rules, a player does
not have to wait for the referee to
touch the ball if his team maintains
possession of the ball, but the
referee must check the ball after
each change of possession,
including field goals. This rule is
opposite from the U.S. rule.

There is much concern in FIBA

much so that FIBA adopts two
“American” rules each year so
that, eventually, FIBA and the
United States will play the game
under similar rules. After all, it is
America’s game.

It would cause a considerable
amount of confusion for FIBA to
change rules each year. European
players who get used to playing
under certain rules must adjust.
In addition, the United States is
constantly changing its rules,
especially on the college level.

“We are very unhappy all
around the world because every
year we change to two American
rules. In Europe, we have the

down the game,” Tank said.

FIBA is also adjusting the in-
bounds rule to the American way
of a free in-bounds after a change
of possession and waiting for the
referee to touch the ball if the
offense maintains possession.

Whether these rules are good
or not is debatable. According to
Tank, it is just a matter of taking
basketball too seriously when it
is just a game. i

“In basketball, what is fun?
Running, passing the ball and
slam dunking. We want the kids
to have fun,” Tank said.

on either side of the goal posts to
keep the ball in play on missed
field goals.

“It’s kind of weird," said
Osborn, “the ball goes off the
net, that’s the crazy thing. I
always kid that if you hit the
ball off your head and it goes
over, you get six points too.

“Sometimes the refs don’t
even know the niles, whether
it’s a three or five yard
penalty. It’s definitely a
virgin game. I don't think too
many people know what’s
going on.”

Coach Hearing used Osborn
sparingly in his first two
games but has given him a lot
more action in the Gladiators

two losses to Denver.

“He's been playing more and
more every week," said Haering.
“It didn’t take long for him to
catch on since he missed training
camp and now he's learning the
rules. He made two great catches
this past week..”

Osborn still hopes to play in
the NFL.

“Maybe if I can go out and
make a couple of catches, I can
get noticed a little bit and get
a break in some other league,”
he said.

‘‘If you know anybody at the
Steelers, give them a call. I’d
be glad to get a tryout for
them and may [be] given a
chance to make that team.”

Conferences as a whole bring
in big contracts from the national
networks and some cable
companies, thereby assuring each
member school a guaranteed cut
of the TV revenue pie. Facing the
possibility of a lower number of
independents, schools such as
Pitt and Miami risk being left out
in the cold to fend for themselves
in an already tight national-
television market which may
become much tighter in the future
due to re-alignment.

Also, the federal government

Football Association contract
illegal, facing universities with

contracts.

“There is some concern that
the federal government may rule
the present CFA contract illegal
for restraint of trade. If that
happens, then there have to be
other means of securing TV
contracts with national networks.
People are lining themselves up
in the eventuality that could
happen. Conference affiliation is
an obvious way to negotiate with
national networks," Billick said.

On the more practical side, Pitt
would face scheduling problems
in the future. If there are few or
no independents remaining, it
leaves few teams for Pitt to play.
Independents who join
conferences must obviously play
the required number of games
within their conference.

have to protect ourselves."

It’s no secret that Pitt has had
problems with home attendance
over the years. While attempting
to restore its football program to
national prominence, Pitt has had
to compete with the various
professional sports around the
city for the residents’ sports dollar.

As a result, Pitt's home football
attendance has experienced its
share of peaks and valleys.

Billick believes that conference
affiliation for the football program
may establish a new meaning to
the home games; thus giving fans
a new reason to attend.

“We’ve seen what conference
affiliation has done for basketball
for meaning and interest in the
games. I think the same thing
could happen in football,” he

A said.

Indeed, if Pitt does partake in
the current conference re-
alignment trend, the university
looks to be starting on some
fairly solid ground.

French fihn Too Beautzfu

By Dmitri Ragano

Entertainment Editor

Conventional wisdom has it
that movie actors and actresses
are just like everyone else —- only
much better looking. Their perfect
looks allow films to carry us into
the realm of fantasy, passion and
romance that might seem
ridiculous in the light of day.

The French film Too Beautiful
for You takes this idea and stands
it on its head. Here the hero
leaves his beautiful wife for an
overweight, rniddle-aged woman.

Bernard (Gerard Depardieu) is
an automobile salesman. His good
nature and sensitivity make him
exceptional in the upper—class
social circle he frequents. These
qualities also make him very
attractive to women. After falling
passionately in love with his
secretary Colette (losiane
Balasko), Bernard's “perfect” life
begins to fall apart. The non-
linear narrative follows Bernard
through the throes of his affair
with Colette and the ensuing
chaos with his wife Florence
(Carole Bouquet) and family.

If all this sounds like your
typical French talkie/sex/
relationship film, well, that’s
pretty much what this is. And if
you generally don’t like thatsort
of thing, then you'll be bored
stiff in T00 Beautiful For You.
The film’s pleasures derive from
its wistful, hypnotic look and a
likeable performance by the
hulking, vulnerable Depardieu.

Those not seduced by
Depardieu or the film’s main
premise will be disturbed by the
film’s lack of momentum. It
seems that director—screenwriter
Bertrand Blier was so thrilled
with his “great idea for a story”
that he didn't develop the
characters or narrative beyond
his concept.

The two women characters
aren’t particularly deep or
interesting. As Colette, Balasko
never transcends her initial
image as dumpy love slave. And
Chanel No. 5 model Bouquet is
stiff and arrogant as the wife,
Florence. These women are
probably just following their
director’s orders, but that doesn’t
help matters.

Josiane Balasko and Gerard Depardieu star in Bertrand Blier's T 00 Beautiful for You.

Comprehensive Borders Bookshop opens in South Hills

By Jessica Coville
Asst. Managing Editor

Amidst a sprawling selection of
“'90;O0O titles, Pittsburgh reading
enthusiasts can now find books
ranging from Irish country
cooking, to the complete works
of Salvador Dali, to the latest in
children's titles, to all the
“classics,” at the city’s newest
bookstore, Borders, located in
South Hills.
“There are three things that
distinguish us from other

bookstores,” said Beth Buchwach,
the store’s manager. Those are
“our commitment to books and
reading, all the titles that we have
available including popular and
back-listed titles, and the fact that
we make the store a place where
people are happy to stay and
browse,” she said:
The atmosphere is like no other.
It is a huge store that covers two
levels with elevators, escalators
and a large staircase connecting
the different floors. There are
sofas and chairs to relax upon

xutin performance artists SEEMEN play Wilkirtsburgs Turmoil Room.

while you are perusing the latest
title by James Michner or a book
on the history of Gaelic peoples.
If there happens to be a title
you’re searching for to no avail,
then there is a capable staff of 25
on hand to answer all your
questions.

“Our employees are a good fit,
and we hire a knowledgeable
staff who know and love books,”
said Buchwach. Although not
required, all of Borders’ staff have
college degrees, and most of them
have graduate or post—graduate

work under their belts.

The employees are all from
very diverse backgrounds. “Some
have degrees in music, history,
and of course there are those of
us with English degrees,”
according to Buchwach.

Ms. Buchwach, a lawyer and
mother herself, is “absolutely
thrilled” with the public’s reaction
to the selection. “People come
into the store and find that book
that they have been looking all
over for,” she said in reference to
some titles which might be more

obscure or a little bit older than
some recent releases.

Opened in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, Borders has now
expanded to 10 stores, and more
are being opened around the
country.

So if you’re trying to find that
special book that no one seems
to have, or you feel like taking
your time to wander around and
look at some of the latest occult
releases, then take a ride out
Route 19 to Norman Center 11 and
discover a book-lover’s heaven.

performance art in\Vilkinsburg

By Manny Theiner
For The Pitt News

Austin, Texas, is a rather
happening place when it comes
to experimental music. A city the
same size as Pittsburgh has
produced monster indie groups
such as Scratch Acid and the
Butthole Surfers, but also even
more adventurous kitchen-sink
material from Miracle Room to
Crust. One ofthe most prominent
and active Austin experimental
groups is the Seemen, a
performance-art trio that fuses
idea—laden skits with electronic
and industrial music and
conceptual videos.

The Seemen are no bunch of
street punks banging on cans.
They pride themselves on the
diversity of their cultural
backgrounds, and all have
bachelor’s or master’s degrees in
fine arts. The Seemen know how
to get funding —— they've been

supported by grants from various
arts foundations. Now they’re
embarking on a major national
tour, hitting all the “avant—
hotspots" including the New
Music Seminar in New York.

In their hometown, the Seemen
have kept busy organizing
experimental gigs with bands
such as the Liquid Mice and
Boxcar Children. They released
several cassettes on their own
Flying Squirrel label, including
the newest tape, Puff Nutten, and
a compilation of Austin bands
called Pleasureland. Last year,
they presented a two-act piece
titled Our Competttiz/eNaturethat
“reflects a civilization being
dominated by aggressive (MEN)
 by dealing with these issues,
we (MEN) hope to educate,
inform and somehow come to
grips with our present roles and
define a new balance in
civilization.”

Naked City
Naked C ity
Elektra

.. Composer/alto saxophonist

John Zorn likes to dabble in a lot
of different musical styles. His
likes include hardcore, bebop
and movie soundtracks. Zorn also
has a fondness for brevity in his
compositions. One tempo starts,
and just as you’re getting used to
it, he pulls the plug on it to head
his group in a different direction.

Naked City is a five-piece band
that brings all of Zorn’s influences
together. In fact, several different
styles show up in one song. “You
Will Be Shot” bounces back and
forth between an odd—tempo
hardcore riff and blocks of total
chaos; it even has some lounge
piano in the bridge. “Saigon
Pickup” shows off Zorn’s
fondness for movie music. The
piano starts out evoking the image
of a movie’s love scene. Suddenly
the sax lets outa vocal-like scream
and guitarist Bill Frisell jumps
into some garage-rock chase-
scene music.

The first seven songs on side
two, each less than 45 seconds,
are the band’s hardcore workouts.
Each one packs in more energy
and clarity than any thrash band
of the last few years. And just to
keep the listener guessing, the
song that follows them is a soft
ballad, the last thing one would
expect to hear unless you know
how Zorn works.

It’s safe to say that what Naked

City achieves has a to do with
the band members’ talents. Along
with Zorn and Frisell are
keyboardist Wayne Horvitz,
bassist Fred Frith and drummer
joey Barom. Each member is well
known in the experimental scene
in New York. Together they bring
Zorn’s ideas to life in a way that
brings out all the little elements
without losing sight of the whole
composition.

There is an old line that there
are 8 million stories in the naked
city. John Zorn seems to take that
to heart because this band sounds
as if they’re trying to tell all 8
million. And at the rate they’re
going, they just might.

The Embarrassment
God Help Us
Bar None

Band reunions tend to be a
disappointment. They usually end
up being a shameful exhibition
of worn-out rockers living in the
past to make more money. In
most cases, the magic of these
bands can’t be recreated.

The Embarrassment’s reunion
proves to be the exception,
perhaps because they never rose
above the status of a footnote in
underground music. The quartet
formed in Lawrence, Kan., 10
years ago and released a few~
obscure records. After a few years,
the group disbanded. Bassist Ron
Klaus was later immortalized in a

Continued from page 12
song by Big Dipper, a band started
by Embarrassment guitarist Bill
Goffrier.

God Help Us has the feel of a
record that was recorded more
for the fun of it than anything
else. In fact, it doesn't sound like
six or seven years have passed
since the last Embarrassment
record. The band's sound is a
combination of primal guitar-
based rock, goofy humor and
strong harmonies that accentuate
all of this. The songs have pretty
basic structures, but that is what
really makesthem stick to you.
The band piles more enthusiasm
into a song like “Train of
Thought,” which is largely one
chord, than any MTV band does
with four chords. It also comes
up with enough variety that it

never wears out a good idea.
“Podmen" has some good slide
guitar work. The chiming chorus
of “Sex Drive" is executed with
all the clarity of a boys’ choir.
Vocalistjohn Nichols has a strong
voice that can go from a high wail
to what sounds like a mock-Peter
Murphy rumble on a few songs.

God Help Us harkens back to
the early '80s, when playing for
the fun of it was the main reason
bands like this existed. Today,
there aren’t many bands that
capture that feeling. The fact that
the Embarrassment’s reunion is
only an occasional thing makes
you wonder why there aren’t any
other bands like this. But let's not
sit and worry about that now.
Throw this down on the turntable
and enjoy!
