New committee to advise Pitt police

By Mark Gordon

News Assistant

Public Safety Director Rick
Boyd is going to get some help
running the Pitt police — only
the help is not coming from
police officers. It’s from the
newly-formed public safety
advisory committee.

“It’s going to advise the
Department of Public Safety
and act as a sounding board
for things that need change,”
said John DeVitto, associate
vice chancellor for business

and finance.

“The purpose was to provide
input as to critical issues for
public safety on this campus,”
said Boyd, the ex-officio
member of the committee.

The committee is made up
of 12 people representing dif-
ferent aspects of the Pitt cam-
pus. The committee has met
for the first time already, and
they plan on holding another
meeting after the winter break,
according to Boyd.

“I tried to get a cross section
of people throughout the uni-

versity,” DeVitto said“The
people on the board are quite
energetic, and they want to
serve.”

Boyd said this committee is
not related to the public safety
committee which oversees
broader issues.

“This committee is an advi-
sory committee. They do not
have any authority over the
police department,” Boyd said.

The report came from

some scientists thought
pornography could be

be used in the treat-

sexual problems.

“My brother and I

BioIogist's discovery making history

Each day, while thousands of Pitt students
attend classes and perform their daily routines,
history is being made on the sixteenth ﬂoor of

the Biomedical Science Tower.

Pitt’s Division of Cellular Therapeutics, led
by director Suzarme Ildstad, has made a break-

bone marrow and organ transplantation is

approached.

Ildstad discovered a cell, the facilitating cell,
which makes bone marrow transplantation safer-

bone marrow transplantation could eventually

lead to cures for diseases such as diabetes, sick-

Bone marrow is the part of the body which

Students work on expanding health-care horizons

By George Cann
For The Pitt News

If you are an undergraduate or graduate
student and are interested in health issues,
maybe the Student Health Advisory Board
is for you.

“My main objective is to see the Student
Health Advisory Board expand in recruit-
ment,” said Rennee Pucciarelli, president of
SHAB. “I am finding out more than I have
ever known in the health care.”

Pucciarelli said her main concern as presi-
dent is that students do not understand how
important the SHAB really is. She also said
that dealing with Pitt’s health fee is a part of
being on the board, as is expand your hori-
zons on health care.

“We just want more diversity and feed-
back from the students,” said Pucciarelli. In
addition to recruiting Pitt students, the
SHAB wants to be more successful than last
year.

The board was started at Pitt 15 years ago.

Each year many students, health-profes-
sion or non-health profession related,
become members to improve the program.
This is achieved by monitoring student
acceptance and dissatisfaction with the
Student Health Service.

Erin Rodgers teaches the Stress
Management Program that is offered to Pitt
students. Other programs the board can pro-
mote are substance abuse, weight control,
sexual health and CPR training.

WASHINGTON — In two

that serious crime continued to
decline in 1994 but that there
was a sharp increase in random
killings by strangers.“

Jordan, who topped the list for

Remember the Michael
Jackson video “Black and

morphing software and hard-
ware for the aspiring video
producer.

For the computer owner
who has a CD-ROM reader
and can’t use it without
shelling out $50 a pop for
CD-ROM software, there is a
CD writer. This means
instead of the software com-
panies determining the CD-
ROM’s contents, you get to
make your own.

There is a plotter that has
the ability to print high qual-
ity 2—dimensional and 3-
dimensional pictures, such as
blueprints or graphs.

There are high quality
scanners to scan images into
a computer. These images
can then be printed,
retouched or thrown into a
document for a great finish-

ing touch.

The TEC lab has the latest
in technology for all your
needs. Please note, this lab is
not there to send e-mail or to
type papers. It is specifically
intended for producing high
quality graphics and printing.
Also, the funds for some
color printing or CD-ROM
writing is not taken out of
your computer fee. You must
set up a separate account out
of the STS office. The TEC
lab offers a Silicon Graphics
workstation and both high
end Macintosh and IBM-PC
machines. It is staffed by
knowledgeable consultants
who can get you started on
your way into the world of
multimedia.

really took off, and it wasn't
just centerfold nudity any-
more.”

He said his problem was
not with nudity as seen in
Playboy magazine, but with
hard-core pornographic mag-
azines and videos which
show intercourse.

“If [centerfold nudity] was
all that pornography was
today, it wouldn’t be a big
deal,” Checkley said. “It may
be offensive to me personal-
ly, because it kind of is, but
it’s certainly not as dangerous
as what we’re familiar with
now.”

Hard-core pornography,
Checkley said, is legally
defined where the indicator is
the presence of a penis.

“If studies are accurate, I’d
venture to guess that 90 per-
cent of you have seen hard-
core pornography and know
what the difference is
between Playboy and hard-
core,” he said. “Hard-core
pornography is straightfor-
ward sex, play to rewind,
front to back cover, and it
will be unmitigated, unre-
strained sexuality.”

Checkley said he often
hears the argument that since
evidence of pornography can
be found in ancient cave
paintings and in the ruins of
Pompeii, pornography is not
a problem.

‘‘I don’t see the logic in
that,” he said. “All that says
to me is that, yes, ever since
mankind’s been around we’ve
been doing a few things good
and a few things bad. I mean,
murder’s been with us, we’ve
been stealing from our neigh-
bors, we covet our neighbor’s
wife, we do political shenani-

gans. So we’ve done pornog-
raphy too. Does that make it

_right? In my mind, no. It’s

not a good argument.”

He also disagrees that
pornography is needed to
introduce people to sex.

“If you need sexually
explicit communication
because you don’t have
enough sexual information,
you came from an oppressed
family, then that’s a prob-
lem,” Checkley said. “But
today you can get quality
books to give you the basic
information needed. You
don’t need a $10 billion
pornography industry to sup-
ply that need.”

While acts such as bondage
and bestiality are not new,
Checkley said today’s mass
communication through tele-
vision, magazines and movies
only makes the pornography
problem worse.

“There’s nothing new under
the sun,” Checkley said.
“What’s different is the level
of explicitness and the level
of availability.”

The pornography industry,
he said, is selling more than
sex, including ideas of power.

“Power is usually conveyed
[in pornography], where the
male is definitely exhibiting
force over a woman, or
describing force, or referring
to a woman in very degrading
ways,” Checkley said.

He pointed to a magazine
called Bitches in Heat as an
example of this show of
power.

“What does Bitches in Heat
mean?” Checkley asked.
“Well, ‘bitches’ traditionally
refers to dogs in heat, and
dogs in heat generally can’t
control their sexual choices.

But human beings are signifi-
cantly different than animals
are. Women don’t get in heat
and can say no. But the infer-
ence of ‘bitches in heat’ is
that they can’t say no, and
that’s a power relationship.”

A second message of
pornography, as with all
advertising, is that people
need it, he said.

“In pornography they have
sex that you don’t practice,
that you’ve never even seen
before, and if you don’t look,
if you don’t check it out,
what might happen to you?
You might not be a good
lover. Someone might laugh
at you in bed. You’ll miss
out,” Checkley said.

Third, pornography sells
fear, Checkley said.

“It comes from the fear of
being left out. Pornography is
the hip, the happening. It’s
where all the new techniques
go on,” he said. “If you’re
left out, where will you be?
You’ll be with the square, the
unhip, the unsexual and the
people who don’t have any
fun in life.’’

Another way pornography
sells fear, Checkley said, is
that it taps into everyone’s
insecurities about their sexu-

ality.
“Will you really measure
up? Is your penis big

enough? Are your breasts big
enough? Maybe you need
breast implants. Maybe you
need love potions.;Maybe
you need this book, How to
Make Love to a Woman or
101 Ways to Get Over or How
to Keep Your Erection Going
All Night,” he said.
Checkley cited evidence
that pornography does cause
harm, including studies in

which 86 percent of rapists
and child molesters report
hard-core pornography as
their number one form of
sexual arousal.

Studies among the general
population have shown that
exposure to hard-core
pornography reduced satis-
faction with one’s partner and
the importance of faithfulness
while enhancing the impor-
tance of sex without emotion-
al involvement, he said.

“I’m going to confess that
these studies don’t prove that
pornography is harmful,”
Checkley said. “But Hugh
Hefner and his ilk don’t have
any studies that prove that it’s
not harmful either. There’s a
simple reason for that: human
beings are too complicated.
There is nothing about human
behavior that comes down to
x times y equals z.”

Checkley said he believes
that the First Amendment
does not cover hard-core
pornography and pointed to
Supreme Court rulings that
agree with this belief.

“Obscenity is a historical
exception [to the First
Amendment],” he said. “It’s
been with us for the entire
200 years, it has a clear legal
history, and every attempt to
get rid of the obscenity
exception has failed in the
courts.”

Presently, many states have
laws against hard-core
pornography, Checkley said.

“If the law were enforced
to the letter, we would get rid
of about 60 percent of all
pornography on the market,”
he said.

At the most basic level,
Checkley said, pornography

-From page 1

“CPR training is very impor-
tant, and we here at SHAB are
excited to provide the facilities
to have it,” said Rodgers. “CPR
is a public awareness situation
that everyone should take part
in.’’

The board was initiated so
students could voice their opin-
ion on health services, accord-
ing to Rodgers.

“The beneﬁt of the board is to
give students the opportunity
for leadership experience,” said
Rodgers. “Students learn how to
educate by putting the programs
into effect and watching them-
selves succeed.”

Pucciarelli and Rodgers

. agreed that their major accom-

plishment through the SHAB
would be to increase the num-
ber of members.

“We want the students to take
an active role in-their health
care,” Rogers said. “SHAB also
wants the students to feel accus-
tomed to come to us for any
concerns that they may have.”

Members participate in the

activities, get together with
other places and discuss the
major issues in health care.

“SHAB would love to see
more of the students involved in
the health issues,” said
Pucciarelli. She said the board
could get a better grasp on the
major health issues if more stu-
dents would be willing to partic-
ipate.

Activities in which the board
has been involved include the
Annual Health Fair, the Seatbelt
Safety Awareness Program, the
Hand-In-Hand Festival and the
Great American Smoke Out.
These activities are just a small
group of many more promoted
by the board.

“SHAB is fun and a place
where everyone can come
together and discuss more pro-
grams,” said Pucciarelli.

Membership is open to
all students who are enrolled
at Pitt and have paid the health
fee. If interested, applications
can be picked up at the
Medical Arts Building on Fifth
Avenue.

graft versus host, a disease in
which the donated marrow
sees the host’s tissue as for-
eign and attacks it.

“Right now, for regular bone
marrow transplants, most peo-
ple will only transplant
patients who are very closely
matched. That means that only
30 percent of people who need
a bone marrow transplant get
one, because the other people
don’t have a suitable match,”
Ildstad said.

For decades other scientists
tried to reduce the instance of
graft versus host disease by
factoring T-cells, a type of
immune cell, out of bone mar-
row. These attempts were not
successful, because the stem
cells failed to engraft without
the presence of the T-cells.

Ildstad discovered that the
facilitating cell, which enables
stem cells to engraft, is very
similar in appearance to the T-
cell. This similarity caused
facilitating cells to be filtered
out of the. bone marrow, along
with the T-cells. ’

By keeping the facilitating
cells and removing the harm-
ful T-cells, Ildstad found a
way to eliminate the risk of
graft versus host disease while

insuring that the stem cells
will still engraft.

“What we hope we can do is
to make bone marrow trans-
plantation a much safer proce-
dure,” Ildstad said. “If we can
reduce the complications asso-
ciated with conventional bone
marrow transplants, then it
would be easier to justify
treating non-malignant dis-
eases.”

Bone marrow transplants
enriched with facilitating cells
and stem cells can be used
along with solid organ trans-
plantation to safeguard against
rejection of the organ.

Ildstad is currently working
in conjunction with Dr. Nancy
Ascher and Peter Stock of the
University of California at San
Francisco on trials to see how
well kidney transplant patients
accept their new organs when
also given a bone marrow
transplant.

Because of this find, bone
marrow transplants now have
the potential to cure red blood
cell defects such as sickle cell
and thalanemia. Despite the
fact that 50 percent of those
with sickle cell die before they
reach age 40, the risk of graft
versus host disease was previ-
ously too high for doctors to

justify transplantation as a
means of treatment.

Ildstad has already effective-
ly cured diabetes in mice by
giving them transplants of
bone marrow and insulin-pro-
ducing cells. She plans to
work towards a cure for dia-
betes in humans as well and,
in the very distant future,
maybe even treat children who
are likely to develop diabetes
while they are still in the
womb.

The most controversial
application of Ildstad’s work is
the transplantation of baboon
bone marrow into humans in
an attempt to cure AIDS. For
reasons that scientists cannot
explain, baboons are resistant
to the HIV virus, which causes
AIDS. The same resistance
may be achieved in humans
via a baboon bone marrow
transplant.

“Theoretically, what should
happen if we can achieve
engraftment is that the baboon
stem cells would produce T-
cells of baboon origin, geneti-
cally baboon,” Ildstad
explained. “These should go
out into the circulation, and if
they can’t be infected then
they’ll live and live long-
term,” she added.

Ildstad just recently
received approval from the
Institutional Review Board to
conduct AIDS trials at UCSF
with Dr. Paul Voldberding and
Steven Deeks.

Ildstad did her undergradu-
ate studies in biology at the
University of Minnesota
before attending medical
school at the Mayo Clinic.
She then did her surgery train-
ing at Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston. Finally
she spent three years learning
to research at the National
Institute of Health and com-
pleted a fellowship in pedi-
atric surgery at Children’s
Hospital of Cincinnati.

Discovering the facilitating
cell and continuing to realize
its potential applications is
like a dream come true for
Ildstad, who knew since age
five that she would be a doc-
tor.

“I just feel really fortunate
to be able to see the clinical
application of something I’ve
spent my life working on, and
I think very people have that
opportunity,” she said. “lt’s
been a really exciting time.”

Legalize betting

“What’s the line on the Steelers’ game this weekend?” It is
not uncommon these days for Pitt students to be asking this
question. Illegal gambling on sports is a big time business at
Pitt, in the city as a whole and across the nation.
Periodically a bookie will get busted, but he usually starts
up again, or if he does not, his market will quickly be gob-
bled up by a competitor. Is this a problem? Well, yes, but not
because betting occurs, but because it is illegal. The Pitt
News believes it is time for gambling on sports to be legal-
ized in the United States.

Some people may strongly object to this idea. They may
say that gambling could lead to games being fixed because

, players and coaches could bet on their own games or that

gambling is a sickness and legalizing it will ruin people’s
lives. These are powerful objections, but they are also prob-
lems which currently exist. We believe that by legalizing
sports gambling not only would these problems not be exac-
erbated, but that they could be lessened as well.

Let’s look at the first problem. Nobody knows to what
extent players and coaches bet on their own games or how
many games are fixed. It certainly occurs sometimes. It may
be a lot; it may be a little. But legalizing sports gambling
does not mean that you have to make it legal for the partici-
pants to bet on their games. There is an obvious conflict of
interest, which could be easily legislated against.
Furthermore, if gambling is legal then it could be regulated.
Records can be kept of who bet and how much, and in this
way players and coaches can be prevented from legally bet-
ting on their own games. Currently, with illegal bookie
betting, there is no regulation, so we have no way of know-
ing whether or not participants are betting on their own
games. .

Now let’s look at the other objection, that gambling is a
sickness which ruins people’s lives. This certainly does hap-
pen to some people, just as alcoholism is a sickness which
afﬂicts some people. But currently many bookies will allow
you to bet without making you put down the money before
betting. This is in their interests, because they have “ways”
of getting that money. But with legalized betting it could be
required that any money gambled be put down up front.
Certainly some people will still get addicted to gambling,
but they will not be able to bet money they do not have.

With these objections brushed aside there is no viable rea-
son for betting to be illegal. It is not the place of the govern-
ment to prevent us from freely choosing to do something
unless societal harm will arise. The reasons above have
shown that there is greater societal harm in keeping betting
illegal. Furthermore, some bookies have ties to other aspects
of organized crime, which could be limited by eliminating
this market. Legalizing sports gambling should be instituted
as soon as possible.

Stop Greek-bashing

I would first like to applaud
Michael Fuller and David
Ruckno. It’s about time that
someone finally stops this
senseless “Greek-bashing.”
Once again, Mr. Kaizar has
taken a tragedy and turned it
into a fraternity issue.
Obviously, his opinion is just
that because he has once again
told one side of the story.

The death of Atif Bhatti is a
tragedy that is in no way
being taken lightly by his fra-
ternity or this community. It
does need to be expressed that
Atif did not die as a result of
being in a fraternity, or from
the negligence of his brothers.
Your comment that “it was
four hours before anyone
checked on him” is absolute
nonsense, and Mr. Kaizar,
what do you suggest his broth-
ers should have done when
they brought him home? They
placed him on his couch, side-
ways. He seemed fine.

When people take their
friends out for their 21st birth-
day, they expect their friend
to be drunk; they expect their
friend to pass out. Until this
tragedy, death never seemed
like a possibility. It’s time to
stop throwing the blame
around, and take this death for
what it is, a tragedy that is
blameless.

While I agree that people
need to be more careful with
alcohol, I do believe every-
thing happens for a reason.
Maybe people will take drink-
ing as a more serious matter
now. Maybe people will be
more careful now,_ and maybe
people will wake up. ’But the
independents who strive on
“Greek-bashing” also need to
wake up and stop this ridicu-
lous blaming. Atif’s friends
and brothers have suffered
enough.

LETTERS TO THE DITOR

Delta Phi Epsilon

Greeks

In writing this, I am not crit-
icizing the fraternity system
here or anywhere, because I
feel that you can do what you
want and believe what you
want, unless your actions
infringe on another person’s
rights as a human being.

I believe that our society
caters to the white male’s
inherent need to dominate the
rest of society. I think that the
fraternity system is one way
that contributes to the male’s
quest for power over others.
In the “Greeks” letter in a past
The Pitt News, why do all of
the positive aspects about
being Greek have to do with
high-paying “important” jobs?
All of the examples that are
cited refer to jobs that give
white males power over the
rest of society. What about all
of the “fraternity men” that
become teachers or electri-
cians? It seems that the writers
of this article are stating that
the only way for your life to
mean something is if you have
money or power. It concerns
me when I realize that three-
fourths of our U.S. Senators
are fraternity men with these
ideals.

Also, although it is
admirable that Greeks raised
so much money for charity
and “alone have saved thou-
sands of lives each year,” I am
curious as to why frat brothers
must brag about such achieve-
ments every time they write a
letter in the Opinions section.
Are you helping people for
humanity’s sake, or is it just
something to put on your
resume to help you on your
quest for power?

Mark D. Valenti

Stephen Foster

In response to the “Stephen
Foster” article written by

. L‘- .. no-nus

Michael S. Barge, why is
it that every year during
“Black Week,” an article is
published putting down
“whites?”

Mr. Barge, you’ve stated
some pretty harsh words about
our fine city and university.
Well, let me tell you
something Michael, if
you don’t like it here in
Pittsburgh, then get the hell
out!-It’s people like you that
make the rest of us who love
and take pride in the city look
bad.

You go on and on about
Stephen Foster and how bad
he was to Afro-Americans.
The issue here is not whether
Mr. Foster was a racist, but
the fact that you have misin-
terpreted the meaning of the
statue. It wasn’t erected to
scorn Afro-Americans, but to
praise the life and musical
genius of a native
Pittsburgher.

While I was reading the
article, I kept on think-
ing about that old “Saturday
Night Live” skit; “I’m
gonna get me a gun and
shoot all the honkies I see.”
Then I was wondering
Michael, do you have any
problems with the game pool?
I imagine you do, since the
game involves a white ball
knocking all the colored balls
off the table. Now see, that
sounds about as asinine
as your entire article doesn’t
it?

So remember, this is
1994 —- not the Civil
War slavery days. Your prob-
lem is that you don’t have,
or even want, a brighter future
—— that’s why you are
dwelling in the past and look-
ing for someone else to blame.
Not only are you a disgrace to
Afro-Americans, but you’re a
disgrace to EVERY living
thing!

The Pitt News, Monday, December 5, 1994

Columnist Nowlin exposes a counterfeit church

: n a column that
V Iappeared in June, I

wrote about a posi-
I tive encounter with
members of my friend
 Carol’s new church in
 Chicago. The people
' were quite warm and

Cfllllnlllist friendly, and I was
Rick _ especially impressed .
NOWIIH with their disregard for

racial differences (Carol is white; I’m
black). I thought to myself, “This is too
good to be true.”

As it turns out, it was. When she was in
Pittsburgh last August for my high school
class reunion, she told me that she’s a
member of the Chicago congregation of
the Church of Christ International, alter-
nately known as the Boston Church of
Christ or simply the “Boston movement,”
named for the city where it began in
1978. It looks and sounds very much like
a cult, and it has a history of what some of
its former members insist is mind control.
What’s more, the church came to
Pittsburgh in the fall and recruits heavily
among Pitt students; I know this to be true
because two members of the mission
team of what has become the “Greater
Pittsburgh Church of Christ” told me as
much in September. '

Cults are generally built around bad
theology, and the Church of Christ

it teaches salvation and regeneration by
water baptism; that is, if you haven’t been
baptized by immersion, then you aren’t
going to heaven. Its favorite prooftext is
Acts 2:38, in which the apostle Peter
admonishes his audience, “Repent and be
baptized  for the forgiveness of sins.”
However, that is simply heretical, since
the Bible makes it clear in several dozen
places that the real agent of salvation is
the blood of Jesus Christ. And while bap-
tism is certainly important, it does NOT
have any real role in a person’s salvation.
Indeed, that verse really means, “Repent
and be baptized  because your sins have
been forgiven. ” This should make sense,
because in the previous verse, the people
in the crowd refer to Peter and the other
apostles as “brothers” —— implying that
they had already placed their trust in the
now—risen Christ.

Another problem is its insistence that it
is the “original church” — insinuating
that all others are frauds. Such contradicts
Jesus’ own words to His disciples, “I have
other sheep not of this fold.” He also told
them not to stop a man not of their num-
ber who was doing exorcisms in His
name, saying, “Whoever is not against us
is for us.” Coming from this mindset of
exclusivity is the notion that leaving the
church can be a danger to one’s spiritual,
and even physical, health. Trouble is, it
doesn’t allow much room for the Holy
Spirit to work and actually places more

emphasis on the organization than with
God. Furthermore, the parable of the
Prodigal Son tells of a forgiving God who
welcomes those who have left and come
back; that forgiving grace is an essential
part of classical Christianity. That grace
apparently has little emphasis in this
church’s teachings.

And that’s where the concerns about
“mind control” come in.

The church operates like many legiti-
mate evangelical organizations, inviting
potential members to Bible studies and
encouraging them to be baptized.
However, it rejects any interpretation of
Scripture that doesn’t fit its doctrine.
During the summer, a friend of Carol’s
called me from Chicago to try to convince
me to join their church, and he got bel-
ligerent when I challenged him! /

Furthermore, the Church of Christ
International operates a “discipling” pro-
gram in which every member of the
church is directly accountable to someone
else. While that sounds good on the sur-
face, placing one’s trust in another in that
fashion can lead to manipulation. Some
ex-members have said that the sins that
they have confessed to older members
have made their way to the leadership and
were used against them, leading them on
guilt trips to keep them in line. Others
were encouraged to break off ties with
families and friends who would not con-
vert; a Pittsburgh Tribune-Review article

in October mentioned several parents of
church members who remained anony-
mous for fear the article would be used
against them.

Members are supposed to give 10 per-
cent of their income to the church and
much more for special projects. Again,
there is nothing wrong with that, but mak-
ing it a requirement again takes the focus
off God and onto the institution.
According to some sources, people have
been forced to sell their homes and give
the proceeds to the church. The church
has been exposed on several TV news-
magazines, among them “20/20,” “Inside
Edition,” the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation’s “Fifth Estate” and two
BBC programs. On top of that, its afore-
mentioned Boston branch has been
banned from proselytizing on the cam-
puses of Harvard, Northeastern and
Boston universities.

My friend Carol was, as you can imag-
ine, quite shaken up when I told her what
I knew; however, I needed to warn her
about that in which she may be mixed up.
And now that the church is here, I am no
less concerned. The Church of Christ
International is an excellent-spiritual
counterfeit, but it is a counterfeit, never-
theless.

Rick Nowlin is a columnist for The Pitt
News and apolitical commentator for
WORD-FM.

International is no exception. For openers,

School prayer
Obviously, the editors at The
Pitt News don’t understand the
First Amendment. Our country
was founded on the freedom of
religion, and there should be no
law “prohibiting the free exercise
thereof.” Clearly, a ban of prayer
in schools violates this premise.
How does freedom to pray trans-

late into an establishment of reli- ,

gion? Students would be free to
pray to Allah, Buddha or
whomever.

The purpose of the First
Amendment was to ensure that
the United States would never
have an official church, like
England had. Now it seems that
the United States is establishing
atheism as the official “religion”
in an attempt to separate church
and state. In a complete turn-
around in under 100 years, this
country now will not tolerate any
religious teachings, while athe-
ism and evolution are presented
as “facts” in public schools. Was
this the idea of our Founding
Fathers? Certainly not.

Sexual assault

This letter is in reference to all
of the opinions expressed con-
cerning the sexual assault on
campus. I’m writing this letter
paying particular attention to one
letter that was submitted to the
editor written by Michael Kaizar.

Kaizar raises some issues
about fraternity life in general,
and also mentions a few things
about the parties that they have
which serve alcohol. He then
goes on to state, “Women are
encouraged to come to these par-
ties. Sometimes obviously, other
times not, the women are set up
so that they cannot avoid having

sex. Sometimes they are forced.”

In my opinion, isn’t it fair to
say that you can avoid having
sex by avoiding the situation
completely? (Unless of course
there are circumstances that are
beyond your control.) I for some
reason seem to think that women
have some sort of control over
their own lives.

Please understand that I am in
no way, shape or form condoning
or lightening the issue of this
unfortunate sexual assault. Nor
am I naive of the fact that a lot of
men, including fraternity men,
are ready, willing and able to take
advantage of a woman, intoxicat-
ed or not. I am just simply look-
ing at this situation from a differ-
ent perspective.

If we as women make respon-
sible choices that are in our best
interest, maybe terrible incidents
like a sexual assault won’t hap-
pen as often. And if getting
intoxicated at a frat party can
somehow inhibit your sense of
good decision-making, why put
yourself at that kind of risk?

Learn from what has happened
by taking responsibility for your-
self and for future reference,
know that this idea of sexual
assault is not so far-fetched.

Underage drinking

Upon reading the piece of shit
thinly veiled by Kevin Kramer to
masquerade as some sort of
investigative journalism, in
Tuesday’s issue of The Pitt News,
I was sickened. Who does this
guy think he is? I can just imag-
ine these people sitting around,
trying to come up with a great
idea for a story, and then realiz-
ing that they can cure society’s
ills by pointing out something

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

that everybody who cares knows
already —— that it is indeed possi-
ble for people who are not yet 21
to enter bars and drink alcohol if
they so choose. Hey, why not try
to get some people fired in the
process? Some things are surely
better left unsaid. Whatever hap-
pened to common sense, com-
mon manners and the ﬁne art of
minding your own damn busi-
ness? Regardless of your person-
al feelings about alcohol and the
law, (and it is the law at fault, not
these local establishments) it just
stands to reason that you don’t go
around causing trouble for peo-
ple who haven’t done anything to
provoke it. So what sort of sensa-
tionalist bullshit do you guys
have in mind next? Why not
have Kevin Kramer dress up as a
9 year old and try to purchase an
item from the children’s menu at
Eat ‘n Park? Or how about bor-
rowing my 15-year-old brother
and taking him to the movies to
see if he can get in to an R-rated
ﬁlm? I wonder if that bouncer at
C.J. Bamey’s will still be willing
to trade entrance for hugs. I won-
der if that guy still has his job.
Kevin Kramer’s article proves
absolutely nothing, and the writ-
ers involved in his project seem
to be devoid of any intelligent
opinions on the issues they dis-
cuss. It comes close to that old
“yelling fire in a crowded the-
ater” thing; these so-called jour-
nalists show absolutely no
responsibility for their actions,
actions that, by the way, can not
possibly have a single positive
result. It is really sad that people
in this day and age seem more
than willing to help pave the way
for more needless bureaucracy
from a government that can’t
even wipe its own ass, let alone
protect individuals from the dan-
gers of alcohol. There are a mil-

lion different reasons why the
government is hypocritical, and
lacking in basic common sense
when it comes to the legislation
of alcohol, not to mention every
other drug. How can we ever
hope to have common sense
solutions to the real drug prob-
lems in this country when we’ve
got college students whining
about the lack of control of alco-
hol, one of the few drugs individ-
uals can purchase without fear of
being arrested? I always thought
that investigative reporting was
supposed to be conducted in a
responsible manner, and in the
best interest of the people.
Kramer’s lousy excuse for
reporting does exactly the oppo-
site.

Underage series

The Pitt News is to be com-
mended for the series on under-
age drinking. Efforts such as that,
which help raise awareness of the
harmful affects of alcohol abuse,
are a beneﬁt to the entire univer-
sity community.

While the overall series was
well done, there was one
assumption in it that needs to be
clariﬁed. That is the implication
that the presence of a campus
police officer in a bar indicates
tacit approval of underage drink-
ing. The main objective of the
campus police ofﬁcers assigned
to the Oakland business district is
crime prevention -— speciﬁcally
crimes of violence, theft or other
crimes that could put our stu-
dents at risk. Their periodic pres-
ence in the area bars is part of the
university’s effort to provide an
extra measure of security for our
students. Our police officers do
not work for the bars and they do

not have the responsibility for
monitoring who is admitted to
the bars. To imply otherwise is
really an injustice to these dedi-
cated and hardworking ofﬁcers.

Recycling

I have often looked through the
pages of The Pitt News and have
been amazed by these little
graphics stuffed into the comers.

They are of trees regenerating
into forests and the slogan

“Read-Then Recycle!” It is all

very nice and dandy except for
the fact that there is no place to
recycle The Pitt News on cam-
pus.

How many trees are cut down
every day so the newest pizza
shop can advertise their new low
prices? What happens to these
newspapers when a student
is done reading them? We all
know that they wind up in the
garbage. .

Maybe it is time for The Pitt
News to begin following their
cute little slogans and work for
recycling on campus. It is obvi-
ously implied that recycling is
important, but tell me, is this just
another case of greenwashing? Is
The Pitt News just putting these
graphics in to appeal to some of
the readers, even if they, in
essence, make no sense?

I invite The Pitt News to take
the initiative and start accepting
their old newspapers and recy-
cling them. Otherwise, you are
wasting a resource that we all
depend on to survive. Maybe if
no papers are taken and read,
there will no longer be a need to
waste this vital resource.

Saturday

tied, make
that shackled,
going into
Saturday’s
game against

Brady Buffalo with
Slater just ﬁve
scholarship players.

But his Panthers escaped with
a 75-73 win and in the process
turned the 5,284 raucous Field
House faithful on to the Willard
Way.

No, they didn’t get to see
Willard’s trademark 94-foot
experience in pressure, because
the ﬁve starters, who accounted
for all but seven minutes, were
all dog-dead tired after playing
the half court game.

But they did get to see the

hustling and tenacious Panthers -

dive for loose balls and wrestle
for rebounds. Pitt outrebounded
the Bulls 45-26. An all impor-
tant edge, considering that with
their only true point guard Andre
Alridge out, the Sotiris Aggelou
pointed Panthers committed 24
turnovers, many going for
uncontested Buffalo layups.

They got to see the emotional-
ly charged Panthers dishing out
reassuring pats and pick ups.
Even the misfit bench was
immersed in the game, backing
the boys on the ﬂoor the whole
game.

And they did get to see a
glimpse of the future in Chad
Varga. Varga, Willard’s first Pitt
recruit, was a leaper without
peer in Saturday’s game. He
dunked and rebounded and
ﬂashed an assortment of moves

9 down low on his way to 22

points and 10 boards. He’s the
type of do-it-all athlete Willard
loves and the kind of player Pitt
fans are going to be seeing a lot
of starting next season.

But even with Aldridge and
Garrick Thomas back in the
lineup tonight and Chris Gant
returning soon, next season is
going to be one long 1994-95
season away. There are no guar-
anteed wins for this club (if
Buffalo ain’t a guaranteed win,
there’s no such thing).

You can point to Willard’s first
season at Western Kentucky,
when he coached a club with
only eight scholarship players to
a 14-14 record. But that was in
the Sun Belt, and guiding this
eight scholarship club through
the Big East has all the trappings
of a bear.

But even though he’s strapped,
the Willard Way is intact.

Pitt notches first win despite adversity

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor

Under different circumstances,
Pitt’s gut—wrenching 75-73 win
over the Buffalo Bulls Saturday
night would not have even been
a close game. .

B u t
dealing with
t h e
P a nth e r s ’
e x t r e In e
depth prob-
lems, coach
Ralph Willard found a way to
escape a near-loss to a team
against which Pitt has owned a
6-0 series record.

With the Panthers’ only pure
point guard Andre Alridge and
shooting guard Garrick Thomas
suspended for one game,
Willard’s withering bench con-
sisted of three walk-ons and two
team managers.

“I told the team before the
game that we’ll have to find a
way to win through adversity,”
Willard said. “We needed to find
a way to gut it out for 40 min-
utes and playing defenses we
don’t normally play. It’s the ﬁrst
step to learning how to win.”

Despite only having five
scholarship players who logged
all but seven minutes of the
game, Pitt raised its record to 1-1
in front of 5,284 rowdy
Fitzgerald Field House fans. It
was also Willard’s first Pitt win,
but it wasn’t easy. I

Buffalo’s Woodrow Williams’
layup sliced Pitt’s lead to 74-73
with 11 seconds remaining in the
game. Seconds later, Orlando
Antigua was fouled, forcing him
to shoot two free throws. He

split them, giving the Panthers a
two-point advantage and plenty
of time for Buffalo to get a last
shot.

With two seconds left, forward
Jaime Anderson got a good look
at the hoop but his three-point
attempt rimmed left, dropping
the Bulls’ record to 2-1.

“We got the play we wanted at
the end,” point guard Modie Cox
said. “I took it and wanted to get
the ball to one of the shooters on
the outside. I didn’t want the
game to go into overtime; I
wanted to end the game right
there.”

Pitt was fortunate the game
didn’t go into overtime. Forward
Chad Varga, who tallied 22
points, 10 rebounds and several
monster dunks, fouled out with
5:52 remaining. That’s when
Willard was forced to use his
bench for extended play.

Nate Cochran got the call. The
6-foot—5-inch punter joined the
basketball team when the Pitt
football season ended. Cochran
contributed one steal, one block
and a lot of enthusiasm.

“Nate doesn’t know the plays
yet,” Willard said, “so everytime
he goes out there it’s an adven-
ture in tenns of the offense. But
Nate always gives you a 110
percent.”

Down 42-39 at halftime, the
Panthers buckled down. Sparked
by forward Orlando Antigua,
Pitt went on a 15-to-4 run to
open up the second half. First,
Antigua grabbed an offensive
rebound,dn’bb1ed behind the arc
and buried athree. After a Varga
layup and a defensive stop,
Antigua hit another three-pointer
with one second on the shot

After surprising Iowa on

round of the NCAA
Tournament, the Pitt volleyball
team headed down to South

match against Notre Dame.

Pitt’s chance at another upset

Men's swim dominates

By Brady Slater
Senior Staff Writer

Compared to what they did Thursday
night, blowing out the field at the
University of Buffalo Invitational last
weekend was all in a day’s work for the
Pitt men’s swimming and diving team.

While making a one-day cameo at the
U.S. Open being held at Erie Community
College of Buffalo, Pitt’s Jonti
Bacharach, Sami Vartiainen, Eric Stull,
and David Williams teamed to win the
800-meter freestyle relay.

“It was really nice to experience win-
ning a race like that on a national level,”
Vartianen said.

But in an effort to give everybody the
opportunity to swim following that high-
light, men’s coach Chuck Knoles decid-
ed to leave the U.S. Open after the first
day and concentrate on the Buffalo
Invite. Swimmers had been shufﬂing
between the two meets all Thursday.

“He wanted to swim everyone and to
see where everyone was at,” Gary Mule
said. “Not everybody had a chance to
swim at the U.S. Open, because you had
to make cuts.”

Not only that, but the U.S. Open events

JAN’ 1 3 " 15.9  995

were in meters and the Buffalo Invite
was in yards, which would allow the Pitt
swimmers’ times to be used as qualifying
times for future meets, like the Big East
Championships.

Pitt finished with 956 points at the
Buffalo Invite, 206 points better than sec-
ond-place James Madison. West Virginia
finished third, followed by Buffalo, St.
Bonaventure, Howard, and Niagara.

“It was just a continuation of our year
so far,” Matt Brady said. “We’ve been
swimming so fast  we were dominat-
1ng.”

And so was Brady. He won the 200
free, 500 free, 1650 free, 200 backstroke,
and the 400 individual medley. He also
ﬁnished second in the 200 I.M.

“Matt is like our Swiss Army swim-
mer,” Mule said. “He can swim many
different events, all very well.”

Following Brady in second and third in
the 200 back were Pitt freshmen Mike
McQueen and Peter Hezky. Hezky fin-
ished second in both the 200 I.M. and
400 I.M. While McQueen took third in
the 200 ﬂy, fourth in the 100 back. Two
other Pitt freshmen Steven Lewter and

Eric Stefanski also took top places.

Women finish third of tourney

By Jerry Klayman
For The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s swim team fin-
ished its first—semester season last
week when it traveled to New York to
compete in two tournaments.

The U.S. Open International Meet
was held at Erie Community College.
This featured teams from the United
States as well as teams from Canada,
Japan and Korea. The four Pitt repre-
sentatives were freshmen Kim Billen
and Isabel Dejo, junior Alicia Tymes
and senior Vicki Geubtner.

“They did a real good job,” said
coach Marian Cassidy Keen.

“Because of the international rules,
they had to adjust a little bit. I am
proud of their effort.” With a time of
27.29 in the 50 meter freestyle, Billen
qualified for the junior nationals.

The last stop of the week was the
University of Buffalo for the Buffalo
Invitational. Many positive things
came out of this meet. The team fin-
ished third overall.

“This meet was a difficult one,” said
Keen. “It gives the coaching staff an
idea of what we need to improve on for

During the meet, many outstanding
performances were turned in by Pitt
swimmers. The best performance was

Pitt wrestling beats No.

By Eric Garver
For The Pitt News

The Pitt wrestling team opened
up its dual meet season Saturday
at the Clarion University Duals,
taking on No. 19 Purdue
University, Drexel University
and No. 21 Ohio State. .

Behind undefeated weekends
from heavyweight standout Pat
Wiltanger (2-0), Bryan Matusic
(3-0), J.J. Fasnacht (3-0) and
Chad Jesko (3-0), the Panthers
outwrestled Purdue .23—10, beat
Drexel 19-12 but lost to Ohio
State 24-12.

Junior J.J Fasnacht won a
tough match against Alex
Coriano of Purdue, 9-8, to start
off and then decisioned Ohio
State’s Jay Michael, 5-3. He fin-
ished the day by ripping Drexel’s
Ryan Sherman, 7-1.

“We did real well against
Purdue and Drexel but looked
kind of ﬂat against Ohio State.
Everybody wrestled tough, but
Chad (Jesko) and (Bryan)
Matusic showed a lot of heart

and really helped us pull
through,” said Fasnacht of the
weekend.

Jesko, a freshman at the 126-
pound slot, beat Joey Coghran of
Purdue in his first match, 9-6;
defeated Rob Archer of OSU, 4-
2 and major decisioned Brett
Kendall of Drexel, picking up
four key team points, 16-8.

Bryan Matusic, a 167-pounder,
won a big technical fall 23-8 over
Purdue’s James Crnich in his first
match. He then whipped Juggy
Franklin of Ohio State, 13-6, and
beat Drexel’s Scott Morgan in his
ﬁnal match, 3-2.

At 118, Pitt didn’t have much
‘luck, as the matches were split
up. Sophomore Chris Stevens
wrestled two matches, losing
both by only one point. Eric
Knopsnyder also competed
against Drexel’s Tim Scooros
and was defeated by a score of
10-6.

Filling in for the Panthers’
standout 134-pounder John
Richey, who may have done
damage to his knee, freshman

Chris Cox was impressive, going
1-2 in the ﬁrst three matches of
his collegiate career. Against
Purdue’s Frank Laccone, Cox
was decisioned by a score of 15-
3; lost a match in overtime, 4-2
against Ohio State’s Dave Skerl
but finally got a win, 9-6, over
Drexel’s Mike Ubaldini.

Chris said of Saturday’s match-
es, “The team did alright, and this
(the quad-meet) experience really
helped us know where we stand
right now, but I’m sure we still
have a lot of work to do because
it’s early in the year.

“As for me, it was good to get
out there and wrestle, and I still
have a lot of work to do as well.
But we know there is some dam-
age to John’s knee, and we hope
he can come back soon.”

Redshirt freshman Mark Bodo,
at 190 pounds, also turned in a
successful performance at
Clarion, going 2-1 overall.
Against John Hansen of Purdue
in his first match, Bodo won a
decision 2-1 but was turned away
in his second match by one point

In Bodo’s third match of the day,
he got back on the winning track
by crushing Drexel’s. Bob Neitz,
6-3.

“Against Ohio State we looked
real sluggish and out of shape,
and we gave up some real crucial
pins. You can’t expect to do that
against a good team and win,”
Bodo said.

Brett Gould wrestled all three
matches at 150 on Saturday and
went 1-2 for the day. In his ﬁrst
match against Eric Douglas from
Purdue, Gould was decisioned
closely, 8-7. Against Ohio State’s
Rick Monge, he was pinned at
the 5:57 mark, but in his final
match Gould won an impressive
6-4 decision over Drexel’s Rob
Fieo.

At 158 lbs., John Winthrow
went 1-2 in his three matches,
winning his opening match 4-2.
He lost his next match against
Ohio State’s Eric Smith 10-8 in
OT and then was defeated 4-1 in
his last match by Drexel’s Joshua
Stanley.

Also splitting up time were
juniors John Gibeaut and senior
Derek Burgert at the 177-pound
weight class. Gibeaut won a
major decision against Purdue’s
Mike Quirk, 11-3, but was
pinned in his second against
Ohio State’s Mitch Clark at the
6:01 mark. Burgert lost his only
match to Drexel’s Steve Bells, 2-

1. -
Finally, wrestling for the ﬁrst
time this year after a tough knee
injury last year, Pat Wiltanger ran
through his competition, winning
4-1 over Purdue’s David Pierce
and 7-4 over Jeremy Tate of
OSU. Finishing up at heavy-
weight was Jeff Dyer, who lost in
the ﬁnal match to Drexel’s Jeff
Huntington, 5-1.

“We still have a lot of improv-
ing to do, but it’s early in the year
and there’s room for improve-
ment,” said Fasnacht.

The good showing at Clarion
should be enough to move the
37th—ranked Panthers up in the
ratings. Pitt’s next match is
Wednesday at Fitzgerald Field
House against Bloomsburg at
7:30.

shouldn’t be at the Sweet 16.
It’s a bitter-sweet loss because
we were so close.”

Despite dropping the final
three games of the match, Pitt
played the Irish closely
throughout the match.

“Today’s match was a weird
beast,” Alvear said. “We were
ahead in every game. Nobody
completely took charge. It was
a see—saw match. The momen-
tum went back and forth. We
were pretty evenly matched.

‘‘It is tough to lose when
you’re up and you let it slip
away,” Alvear said.

First-tearn All Big East selec-
tion Jennie Driscoll played hard
and put up some big numbers.
Driscoll had 17 kills, 6 digs and
10 block assists.

“Jennie Driscoll had All-
America stats against a nation-
ally ranked team,” Alvear said.

Stephanie Dufresne also
added to the Pitt attack with 40
assists and 13 digs. Carrie
Thornton had 27 digs and 7
kills as well for Pitt, which was
unable to slow down the tough
Notre Dame squad.

“There were a lot of shifts in
the momentum of the game
where a team would score 5 or
6 points in a row,” Notre Dame
head coach Debbie Brown said.
“I don’t think either team really
felt in control. We just hap-
pened to end on one of those
momentum swings.”

Pitt’s load was eased a little
by the injury of Notre Dame’s
go-to player Christy Peters,
who still was not at 100 per-
cent

“She’s the heart and soul
senior leader, and the injury
hampered her,” Alvear said. “It
was evident, but great teams
overcome these as Notre Dame
did today. Christy came out to
play, and it showed a lot about
