‘Shoe Connoisseur’ talks kicks

by Jamar Thrasher
and Joe Kennedy
1 Staff IV/‘item

Bobbito Garcia recalls a time when people
cleaned their shoes better than they cleaned
their teeth. .

“I remember people walking around with
toothbrushes,” said Garcia.

Garcia, a writer, former basketball player,
D], TV show host and self—described “sneaker
connoisseur,” told an audience at Carnegie Mel-
lon University about-the early days of sneaker
culture, when people went through great lengths
to keep sneakers impeccable during unfavor-
able circumstances such as the snowy weather
Pittsburgh students faced on Monday.

Ever since he can remember, he’s been ad-
dicted to shoes. He was painting shoes and
 fashion advice at the age of 14.

“I’m an artist at heart,” said Garcia, who
has gotten several custom—designed shoes from
leading shoe manufacturers like Nike.

Garcia talked about the history of sneaker
culture and the re—emergence of sneaker col-
lecting as an “art form.”

In 1996, Garcia released his book, “W'here’d
You Get Those?” The book provides a look
at Garcia’s collection of shoes, street basketball
culture, hip—hop culture and sneaker culture
in general. The .280—page book, which details
the extensive history of sneaker culture, is re-
garded by some as an early, must—have sneaker
style "guide.

CMU seniors Elliott Curtis andjesse Chorng
used their love for the book and sneaker society

; to create a course, “Sneakerology 101” as part

of StuCo, a program that allows CMU students
to create and teach their own classes.

“We view Bobbito’s book as more of a
textbook than a magazine or a picture book,”
said Curtis.

Before 1960, sneaker culture didn’t ‘really
exist, said Garcia. V _

Garcia said when the Puma Clyde was

released in the 19605, the sticker—shock price -

revolutionized the way people cared for their
shoes. 9
Before that time, people played “stepsies,”

where everyone stepped on people’s feet when
they bought new shoes. Garcia said that the $24
Puma Clyde was so expensive that the game
stopped completely.

Converse and Pro—Keds began offer-
ing shoes in colors other than the traditional
black and white pairs that were readily avail-
able, giving kids an opportunity to creatively-
express themselves through their footwear.

The Pro—Ked 69er and the Converse Chuck ,

Taylor were starting points for what is now a
booming lifestyle.

The culture thrives, according to Garcia,
because of its early ties to hip—hop and bas-
ketball. Early models of Chuck Taylors were
initially only marketed to professional basketball
teams. ' '
“Boston Celtics always had 111 kicks,” he
said. '

He gaveexamples of shoes and colorways -
‘ that were only worn by basketball teams, such

as the Adidas Americana, which sponsored the
American Basketball Association.

Though theicurrent economy might in-
timidate “sneakerheads” shelling out hundreds
of dollars per pair, Garcia mentioned that the
culture emerged during a similar recession in
the 19705. ‘ ‘ _

i “We built this culture with the least amount
of resources,” he said, and recalled a time when
kids could “look fly with some $14 shoes.”

_ The Adidas Top Ten, however, was the first
shoe to hit the $100 mark. 1

It takes a lot of courage and forward think-
ing to stand out in ﬂashy—colored kicks, said
Garcia. The bright and bold shoes now worn
by sneaker aﬁcionados weren’t always an easy

, choice. "

He said the early sneaker trends of the 1980s
bore outﬁt—shoe combinations that many people
might have thought didn’t match.

“You took the chance of getting made fun
of,” said Garcia.

Beyond the ﬂashy,‘ expensive and popular -

aspects of the sneaker game, Garcia makes sure
that his love for footwear provides for those
who might not have the same opportunities

that he had. He didn’t give a number for how ’

many shoes were ir1 his collection.

“I don’t keep track of how many shoes I ’

have, I keep track of how many I give away,”
he said.

Garcia’s Hoops for Hope program has
helped to buy shoes for African children to play
basketball in.  said he hopes basketball
can help those children to keep their hearts and
minds strong and better themselves.

“On a daily basis I don’t throw the extra-
celestial joints on,” said Garcia. Instead he pre-
fers to wear shoes that he jogs 

At the end of the talk, Curtis unveiled a “se-
cret”  to Garcia: the “Reebok Sneakerology 0
Reverse jam,” a revisionist twist. on a Reebok
shoe that made its debut in 1991. This sneaker,
which is the final product of the Sneakerology

course, is maroon, gray and yellow to represent

Fallen officers deserve

support from students

outside the context of busted parties ,

-Three Pittsburgh police officers
lost their lives in a bloody shootout
with ex¢Mai:ine Richard Poplawski in

Stanton Heights on Saturday morn-
 The incident marks the ﬁrst time
in Pittsburgh that three officers lost
their lives in a single incident and
the first time since 1995 that a city
police ofﬁcer lost his life in the line
of duty. « .
The families and friends of the
fallen officers, Paul Sciullo, Stephen
Mayhle and Eric Kelly, have received
a huge outpouring of support from

and speeding tickets.

But these three men died while i
doing their jobs. And perhaps even
more tragic is that their deaths were i
utterly senseless —— the circumstanc— T

these officers were victims.

It’s not fair for us to say that the  ,
support has been entirely for these y
men as police officers, because by 
saying that we lose the fact that

stores like Wal-Mart and Target. The site goes

on to suggest that we the people are also to

“Studies indicate that core consumers are
tired of the store and restaurant choices avail-

ANDREW BIRD
Tonight, 8 p.m.
Carnegie Music Hall, Oakland
412-622-3131

Andrew Bird has an incredibly
soft voice. ’

\When he speaks, his words are
slow and crisp, each sentence clearly
well thought out The music that erna—
nates from the multidnstrumentalist,
then, seems to make sense —- delicate,
detailed and beautiful. A

With his latest record, Noble
Beast, Bird takes listeners on a musi-
cal hike through enchanted woods,
complete with violins, guitars, hand
claps and, as appears on so many of
his records, whistled melodies.

Since Bird left his first gig ——- as a
member of the swing revivalists Squir-
rel Nut Zippers .-—— he’s been making
music that floats between folk, rock,
and old-world jazz and blues.

Bird recently spoke to The Pitt
News about music, his decidedly un-
rock ’n’ roll life and the liquid state of
songwriting. .

The Pitt News: How much of what
you write never makes it intoa song?

Andrew Bird: I started off writing

25 or 30 songs for a record and cut- 4

ting half of them. But that became

such a heartbreaking process. Now I .

tend to take the same 10 or 11 songs
and record them in like 10 different
ways, putting them in different lights.
Sometimes I’m writing three different
songs at first and  realize theyfre the
same song. I put them together and
cut off the fat;

 

TPN: Your songs often trans-
form greatly from one live show to
the next How do you put together
a set list?

AB: You’re tempted to do what'-
ever worked the night before, but you
have to work against it. Once you
repeat the night before, there’s the
potential for getting in a rut When
you’re playing every night, it’s a lot to
ask of yourself, but you have to work
to make the set more precarious.

TPN: Do you look back on your
time with the Squirrel Nut Zippers
nostalgically? I i

AB: It was pretty exciting to be a
part of that. I was 22 or 23 playing for
over a thousand. people a night and
hanging out with a hard—li_ving, South-
ern, eccentric group of people. -But it
was a double-edged sword, because
years afterithat, my own ‘original stuff
and the promoter of the show would
say, ‘Come on, daddy—o, come down
for a swing lesson.’ But my music had
nothing to do with that scene.

TPN: What factors pushed you
towarda completely solo career apart
from [your former band, Andrew
Bird and the] Bowl of Fire? '

AB:  the road, really hard
with ﬁve people and no support —
all sleeping in one hotel room if we
‘could afford it. And the pressure of
being the host of a large band, and
also just creatively not  to del-
egate parts to other musicians with
their  taste. I was  bass
lines in pizzicatoin an octave pedal
and playing whatever felt natural, not
thinking  a bass. player at all. There
were no rules all of a sudden. I was
just doing what I’cl suppressed. '

Pondering Pittsburgh’

on Michael Chabon’s breakthrough '

After premiering at Sundance over
one year ago, “The Mysteries of Pitts-
burg _” is finally seeing the light of
day. It spent some time on the shelf,

to be sure, but the movie — based‘

coming—of—age novel + is finally be-

e released in theaters this Friday, and
A the  c'ouldn’t be ‘better.

Because in me coming weeks, as

many of us graduate, celebrate, move .

out or move on, we’ll face our own

- mystery of Pittsburgh: What has this

city meant to us?

i Reel Talk with Tom

For four or however many years,
what role, if any, has this landscape
played in our lives? This place has

been a loverito some and a cruel mis-_
tress to others, this jungle of ancient

' mills and empty warehouses.
,Whatever any" of us decide we
think about this city, it’s clear that
we might not’be thinking about it

for long. The youth population has

been declining for years, and spring '

is the time for another batch of 20-

somethings to head out the door.
The irony is that Pittsburgh is ideal

for  yourself, even if you don’t

want to find yourself here for too A

-long. At least, that’s what the mov-

P ies would have us believe. Perhaps,

s influence infilm andreal life 

considering theamount of cinematic
attention paidlto Pittsburgh in mov-
ies like “Mysteries,” we can turn to
the world of film to help us consider

7 our own Steel City reality and unravel

what it means to come of age in a
place that has yet to discover its own
contemporary cultural role.

the characters — both real and ﬁctitious — who

crises of self-discovery. ,

They grapple with sexuality and affection

in movies like “Mysteries” and “Zack and Miri.

modern cultural anxieties.

The common theme in all of these is tran-
sience, growing up and moving on, be it ﬁom
youthful naivete, figurative demons or the literal
walking dead. If the setting of these movies is as

I rife with metaphor as the flesh—craving undead
roaming their streets, then we might surmise that ,

Pittsburgh is a place for transients, for the mis-

guided and maladjusted, for us twisted youths L
’ that have yet to discover how we ourselves ﬁt

our college years.

Naturally one might argue that college itself
is a catalyst for self—'discovery, whether or not
your campus is nestled in the valleys of Western
Pennsylvania. In_ a way, that’s true — coming of
age isn’t something you can avoid, not for long,

and it certainly isn’t exclusive to Pittsburghers. ’

Yet for reasonsiother than thelucrative tax

the backdrop for stories of ‘personal. growth

_New York_ City is a circus of taxis and bright

for the damned. Pittsburgh’s identity, it seems,
is its propensity for transformation — the ap-
parent likelihood that living in the shadow of
the Cathedral of  the Cloud Factory or
‘the defunct smokestacks o_f a long-abandoned
foundry might somehow demystify the persis-

tent questions we have about ourselves.

So then, as another academic year draws A

- Littman, page 9

Yes, the practically forgotten hybrid where
a guy ﬁlling out the lineup pencils in his own
name and decides if he’s‘ in too much foul
trouble to be on the court. It.was a popular

title for people to hold through the" 1970s,

partly because it allowed teams to not pay an

extra salary for a coach. It’s basically a two~ \

for—one deal.

The great Bill Russell was a player—co'ach
for the Boston Celtics from 1966-69, mak-
ing him the first black coach in NBA history.
Under his lead, the Celtics won the NBA title
twice. Lenny \X/ilkens, who has the most vic-
tories and losses of any coach ever, also was a

' player—coach for the Seattle Supersonics and

Portland ‘Trail Blazers. ,

So why not Blair? He’s projected as a first-
round pick in the Draft, so Pitt has to sweeten
the deal in an attempt to make him stay. 

him coach certainly does that. A few details .
a need to be worked out before such a deal can

take place, but that’s no problem. v

First off, coaches get paid, but college ath-

letes don’t. So a college player—coach provides a
bit of a conundrum. Well, instead of paying for
Blair’s coaching, give him college credit for it.
Count it as an unpaid internship, but maybe give
him more than three credits. It can be some type
of really intense super—internship that counts
for a few classes’ worth of credits. \
Next up, the wardrobe. Despite my many
letters to the Naismith family, basketball coach-
es still do not wear jerseys while coaching. Only
baseball seems to get how awesomely hilarious
that is. ' - - A
Anyway, obviously you don’t want your star
player wearing a suit, nor unfortunately do you

want your coach wearing shorts and a jersey. - ,
Make him wear dress shoes, but replace the ,

bottoms of the shoes with rubber sneaker—like

implants. Put buttons going down the front _ _

of his jersey, and cufﬂinks on his bicep bands.
He’ll also have a tear—away suit to warm up iri

before games. _ . '

A lot is always made of coaches who are
not only well-respected by their players, but

if he can relate to, his team. Who would better

than a college basketball player?

So it’s very likely his team would like 

Plus, how can a player get mad at Blair? He
could tell them to run eight suicides after a two-
hour practice and not hear a single groan as long
as he ﬂashed them that giant smile of his.
Also, things might get a little hairy with

technical fouls in one game, as long as the refs
keep track of whether the technical was given, .
to player Blair or coach Blair. If he’s thrown V

out of a game for reaching under the court,
taking outa bat wrapped in barbed wire and
striking-an opponent, the refs need to ﬁgure out
if that was player Blair or- coach Blair. Basically,
it’s doable, but it’s going to take a little more
effort by the referees.

This ‘only works if Blair is serious about
coaching. He needs to sub properly, ‘and he

11

can’t play himself all game, unless of course
for some reason he’s needed all 40 minutes.
The only reason that makes sense right now
is if justﬁvé players_show up.

Hopefully it doesn’t come to this, but in
case it does, there you have it, head honchos at
Pitt. It’s a scary possibility, but it is a possibility,
so be prepared.  _ '
