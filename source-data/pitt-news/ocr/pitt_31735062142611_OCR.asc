Nearly 1000 students garbed in

Returning for the first time since

Student congress is setting up
the program on a suggestion by

congress is led by Ted Mallinger.
The group includes Susanne Dav-

pect to register 621/2 per cent more ‘new freshmen
than last fall when a record registration for new
freshmen vims ‘set.

Up to September 7, the University admitted 1545
freshmen to the College, Engineering and
Mines, and Business Administration schools.

Advanced standing new students in ‘the same
schools numbered 465, and the re-admissions of
former students, 865. The total in these categories
according to Registrar J. G. Quick exceed 3000.

Not since the year 1930-31, when the total num-
ber of students reached 16,259, has the University
enrolled so manypstudents. During the year 1943-
44, the total enrollment of students was only 9405;
it climbed to 10,802 in 1944-45; and reached an-
other high mark in 1945-46 of 15,994, of whom
4500 were veterans.

Because of the need of more space for class-
rooms, the Bayard Morewood building—the old
Shadyside Academy—-has been converted into lec-
ture rooms for students in engineering and busi-
ness administration. An increase in chemistry lab-
oratories also has been planned.

New teacher training subjects will be added
to the Evening school, along with courses in edu-

hology.

ResearchFunds

In Science

The Buhl foundation, the Na-
tional Foundation for Infantile
Paralysis,‘ and Charles A. Locke
of Pittsburgh, have furnished the
University with separate funds
amounting to $335,620.

The Buhl foundation grant of
$205,000 ﬁnances a five year pro-
gram of research  natural sci-
ences. This fund ‘extends a re-
search program begun at Pitt by
the Foundation in .1936 for studies
in biochemistry, physical and or-
ganic chemistry, biology, physics
and psychology. During -the past
decade, among other discoveries,
the University has done pioneer
work in isolating vitamin C'and
analyzing its effects. on nutrition,
and developed the new micro-
tome, a fine specimen slicer forthe
electron microscope. The ten
years’ research consumed more
than a ciuarter of a million dol-
lars in foundation funds.

Under the supervision of Dr.
Max A. Lauffer; associate pro-
fessor of physics, the paralysis
foundation’s grant furthers Uni-
versity work for a period of one
year in the study of the “physi-
cal, chemical and bioligical na-
ture of viruses in general.” The
sum of $30,620 will be applied, ac-
cording to Dr. Lauffer, to these
studies “with their applications to
the ﬁght against polio.”

All. plans have not been com-
pleted by the committee.

Council Opens
Book Exchange

Do you have any textbooks you
don’t need?

Do you want to know where to
sell them? ,

The Men’s Council Book Ex-
change, inactive for the past four
years, will resume operations to-
morrow morning at 11:30 on the
eighth floor of the Cathedral and
continue to function until Octo-
ber 4. That gives students two
and one-half weeks to sell books
to the exchange or buy other books
from the exchange. ’

To sel1_a book, a student deter-
mines what price he wants for it
and turns it in to the exchange.
When the book is sold, the ex-
change keeps fifteen per cent-of
the return and notifies the student
by postcard to come in for a check
for the remaining amount of the
selling price. When a book is
neither sold by the exchange nor
recalled by its owner, the ex-‘
change disposes of it at its dis-
tcretion.

To avoid confusion one book
may not be traded directly for
another book. Money will be the
only medium of exchange. Veter-
ans may not purchase these books
through their GI Bill of Rights
‘allowance. .
The exchange will be open Mon-
day through Friday from 11:30 to
4:30 oclock. . » ~

Howdy Hop ‘Scheduled

The University social season
will open with the “Howdy Hop,”
an informal afternoon tea dance,
scheduled for Wednesday, Octo-
ber 2, in Syria Mosque.

“The aim of the ‘Howdy Hop,’
as the name implies, is to get Pitt
people to meet other Pitt people,”
said Russ Robinson, Hop chairman.
Dancing at the non-date affair
will be from 3:30 until 6 o’clock.
The “Howdy Hop” is sponsored by
the social committee of Student

Counselor-Frosh Meeting

Slated for This Friday

Freshman male registration estimates of between 1000 and 1500
have occasioned the planning of a broadened counselor program by

the office of the dean of men.

Motive for the extensive activities is “To foster congenial rela-

tions between upperclassmen and freshmen, and

to give freshmen

some appreciation of the traditions at Pitt,” says Mr. William Saal-

Men’s Rushing
Time Extended

Major changes in the fraternity
rushing rules for the fall term
are centered about the lengths of
the rushing and silence periods.

The fall rushing period, accord-
ing to Ned Mclntosh, assistant to
the dean of men, will extend from
Monday, October 21 at 8 a. m.to
2, a. In. Sunday, November 17.

Traditional silence has been in-
creased to a full week beginning
with the close of rushing and ex-
tended until the following. Mon-
day, November 25. at 5 p. In. All
bids by the fraternities must be
ﬁled with the dean of men by
Monday morning, November 18,
at 10 o’clock.

Rule changes designate Friday
and Saturday of each week’ dur-
ing the rushing period for fresh-
men visits to the fraternity houses.
Only one mixed social event may
be‘ scheduled for the week. No
over-night guests are permitted
in the houses during rushing.

Additional rulings, as mention-
ed by Mr. McIntosh, place re-
strictions on freshman acceptance
of bids: “If the rushee does not
accept his bid by -the termination
of the silence period, he will be
unable to consider affiliation un-
til January 2.”

Trustees’ meeting July 24, Dr.
John P. Weber, university secre-
tary, announced the Board’s com-
mendation of “the faculty and the
deans . . for the excellence of
their work in meeting the emer-
gencies of increased requirements

formal practice game with Du-
quesne university _last Saturday
afternoon at the stadium, the Blue
and Gold are now ready to settle

down to the prescribed once daily
diet in anticipation of the season
lid—lifter. ‘
Inasmuch as the official lineup is
yet to be posted, the ‘Pit: starting
party may include most of those
who took off against the Dukes. It
would present Leo Skladany, and
Bill McPeak, 1945 regulars at the
ends and Jack Durishan, a 1942
letter winner and Bob Plotz, six-
foot freshman from Martins Fer-
ry, Ohio at the tackles.- A

Freshmen may get the nod at
the guard positions; Bernie Bar-
kouskie, Kulprnont 200—pounder
rand Bill Courie, the Arnold Ava-
lanche, are the logical choices.
The center spot most likely will
be handled by scrappy freshman
Lee Ward, or _the veteran Henry
“Clip” Clougherty who has been
nursing some battered ribs.

The Jungle Cat backﬁeld is
light and fast. Handled from a
modiﬁed T, the Pitt offense should
be quick and may be sharp. La-
boring ln the quarterback notch
will be either Carl DePasqua of
Williamsport or 'Donora’s Lou
Ceccone.

Lindy Lauro of New Castle or
Bill Bruno, Penn High product,
will get the fullback job. The left
half position will be thrust ‘into
the capable arms of Bobby Lee
While Bill Abraham and Pete
Daley vie for the right half hon-
ors.
