a"Advising Study Implemented

.jéU's,r



k.-on

BY GEORGENE KALEINA

A University-wide study of
undergraduate advising and coun-
seling to determine its effective-
ness in relation to students is being

organized by the Student‘Affairs ,

Committee of the University
Senate, according to Associate
Professor Robert H. Connamacher,
committee chairman.

“We need to. formulate an
overall consensus of what advising
is on this campus,” Connamacher
said. “A broad statement of

purpose will be formed and cover a .

delineation of the system as it
exists now, the effectiveness of the
system and its overall efﬁciency.

“The interrelationship of the
various advising and counseling
segments will also be important to
the scope of the study,” Conna-
macher said. _

Connamacher stressed the direc-
tion‘ of the study will be
studentoriented. “Our ﬁrst task is
to get together initial and impor-
tant information such as, are the
students being well-served, how
can they be better served, and are
the services known to the stu-
dents,’ ’ Connamacher said.

There are many problems

students have in advising where_

 

a.

there is no single cure, according to
Associate Professor Alan M.
Lesgold, a coordinator of the
advising study and member of the
committee.

“There is no speciﬁc officerthat a
student can go to with problems,”
Lesgold said. “A referral ofﬁce
would be helpful.”

Complete centralization of ad-
vising is notlan objective of the
study,'according to Lesgold.

“It has to be decentralized

‘because the schools feel they are

giving the students the best but
more of an understanding of the

advising system is essential,” he

said.

The study is not being organized '

to investigate the advising of the
separate schools,‘ Lesgold added.
“Our primary concern is not to
fix up some school that may be
doing a bad job but rather deal with
things that affect the student more
directly than the individual
schools,” Lesgold said.
Connamacher noted that a major
input into this study will come
through the student via a question-
naire sent out by Student Gov_ern-

Penn State University student
organization, backed by consumer
advocate Ralph Nader, said Mon-

  Health Survey on the Way

BY SUSAN MANNELLA _

. Surveys to determine how the
Student. Health Service can better
serve the University are being
planned by the Student Health
Advisory Committee (SHAC), ac-
cording to committee member
Marc Hiller.

“Something hasto change to

how students feel about the Health
Service, what their desires, needs
and complaints are.

The surveys should be formul-
ated by the end of October at the
latest, Hiller said, and the
information gathered will be used
in planning the service for future
years. ' ’

Following the initial selection
process, participants will be
interviewed by members of SHAC.

Student Health Service Director

' Joanne K. Robinson agrees there is

a need for changes within the
service, especially because of
skyrocketing costs for medical
supplies and services.

“We have a good service here if
you're sick,” Robinson said. “I
would like to see Student Health
with a consumer board that would
actually contribute to the quality of
life on the campus. That sounds
like an empty statement, but I
believe Student Health can play an
important role.”

Robinson said she would like to
see more work withinthe Service
on health education, such as
forums on nutrition or family

planning and more paramedical —

staff members in the Center.
Hiller agreed that more para-'
professionals on the staff could be
beneﬁcial for the Health Service.
“I hope we will see para-pro-
fessionals doing counseling, and
nurse practitioners. Ithink we can

provide a greater quantity and
quality of service in that manner,”

Hiller said.

Currently, there are about 16
part-time staff members in Student
Health, according to Robinson.

Robinson said she would also like

Pitt's PIRG  
Funding Plan

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

Pitt’s Public Interest Research
Group, PittPIRG requested but was
refused permission by the Board of
Trustees last year to solicit $6 from
each student per year, according to
PittPIRG faculty advisor Robert
Connamacher.

“After a closed-door’ session of
the Student ‘Affairs Committee of
the Board of Trustees, it was
decided that we could not get funds

Under the proposal, much like
the one offered at Penn‘ State last
summer by PennPIRG, the $6 fee

BY GEORGENE KALEINA

The campus bus is slow and inefficient, accordingto a
student who voiced her complaint to the Livewire.

After she waited for the bus for half an hour, it passed
her by because it was too filled to take on any more
passengers. ‘ Thus, she missed her class, at Trees Hall
because she refused to walk there, fearing the “high crime
rate in the area."

Since the bus is a necessity and not a luxury, she said
an additional bus during peak hours was a possible solution
to the problem. .-

.Of the 50 students questioned who ride the bus,
reactions were mixed. Almost half said the bus was

efﬁcient and would be even more so if it_were faster. Over‘

,half said the bus was undependable, inefficient and too
slow.

“The bus driver takes a lot of breaks and is inconsistent
on how long he takes to go around the loop," said Jerry
Demuro, who rides the bus frequently. “People get shut

.'out too because it‘s too crowded.” ‘ -

Another student voiced a similar complaint. A “You can't_

depend on the bus to get around," Bill Barbour-, an
elementary education major, said. ‘ A

The bus driver for the morning and afternoon shift is
alloted three main« breaks, according to Motorpool
Manager Charles Douglas. W .

“He takes" a break from 10:15 to 10:45, 11:45 to 12:30
and 3:15 to 3:45," Douglas said. .

In reply to the complaint of the bus missing the schedule,
Douglas said, “It’s unrealistic for any transportation
company to expect to keep perfectly to a schedule. They
can have one, but it's hard to maintain it because of

'unforseen incidents such as trafﬁc, breakdown, snow or

ice."

The crowding problem on the bus has been agreed upon M

by many of the students.

Douglas said that it is hard to gauge the number of riders
in any given period now. He also said_ weather had a lot to
"do with the number of riders.

The bus driver keeps a running tally of the number of
students who use the bus, according to Douglas. “From,
these tallies, which will come the end of this month, I will
be able to tell the peak hours from a passenger coun_t.''
’ ltthese statistics prove there is a great overload during
peak hours, a decision will be made about another bus,
according to Douglas. _“This is assuming there wouldbe
money for another bus" during peak hours." »

hours, the bus would be bought for four blocks at $13.50 an
hour." Douglas said. “You’re talking aboutpﬁve days a

money would have to come from the operations budget.

Douglas emphasized no recommendations would be‘

produced until he receives- a passenger count in the next
few weeks. '

“The bulk of students used the bus for physical;. .-

education classes, but since a new parking lot has been _

installed across from the ﬁeld house, students and faculty , 

park their cars and ride the bus down to the lower end of
campus,” Douglas said.

Another possible cause of the overcrowding proble
suggested by students is the availability of the bus to
everyone.  .

Non-Pitt students use the bus to go up the hill since Pitt
ID cards are seldomly checked. according to one student. I

If the campus bus was limited to only Pitt ID holders '

(students. faculty and staff), then a decrease in the
overcrowding might occur. '

Under the proposal, which was
signed in a petition drive by 24,000
students, anyone who did not want
to contribute could apply later for a

refund. The grouptheoretically
could have collected $300,000
annuaﬂy.

The trustees were vehemently
opposed to that funding mechan-

ism, saying it would prey on
student apathy and lack of
knowledge.

The board, instead, offered to
allow a so-called positive checkoff,
which would have allowed each
student to voluntarily contribute to
PIRG through his tuition bill. ‘The
PennPIRG students rejected that
system as being too weak to be
useful. _

The PIRG camp unabashedly
acknowledges that the investiga-
tion is a weapon designed to gain
their ultimate objective of estab-
lishing a PIRG group in Pennsyl-

the move as a threat to the board.

said.

Eaton had performed gynecological
tests at Student Health, although
she is not a degreed gynecologist.
According to Robinson, there are
two gynecologists on the Health
Service's staff who work in the
evenings and Eaton has only
performed routine examinations.
“Dr. Eaton doesn't pass herself
off as a gynecologist and, if anyone
objects to her performing the tests,
they can come back -in the

The question of student input in administrative decision-making is a
touchy one since it affects the University ofﬁcial’s role as policy

planner.

'I:liredtocarryoutsetdutieswithinanoﬂice,the administratorrmy
appear to have enough things to worry about, even without the opinion

of students.

- On closer examination, however, every jobholder within the
University does his work for the sake of students, directly or indirectly.
That’s why a special consideration for student opinion should be part of

those policy decisions that will affect students.

Call it input or counsel or whatever, there is a necessity for students
to have some degree of say in policies that determine how they’ll live
and what they’ll learn. Though the degree of say can range from a
token advisory role to student self-govemance, and though student
leaders and Pitt officials tend to charge each other with striving for
either extreme, there is a happy medium that must be arrived at and

kept constant. ‘

' The administration uses a certain amount of student input in every
decision, whether it or students realize this. Though perhaps not a

' Providing only a minimum of regard for student opinion, this kind of

_ decision-making seeks to accommodate students only if their reaction

student opinion says little good about an adminstration and the way it

" The degree of militancy on campus should not play any part in
‘ determining hovii receptive an administration is to its students. This
would only show the administration to be irrational and incapable of

rather as head-banging. , When relations have a tendency to regress in

_ this manner as new issues arise, it becomes necessary for an
‘administration to examine its policy of dialogue and see if it’s a

lest we become blinded by the “Someplace Special” hard Sell-

Pittsburgh is not New York, and what concerns the people of New
York, in light of that city’s theatre musicians strike, does not
necessarily concern the people of Pittsburgh.

, While the Pittsburgh Symphony is regarded as one of the country’s

major orchestras, it has never had widespread popular appeal in its
-own town. '

‘Despite numerous attempts to popularize the classics and despite

the repeated bookings of mass-appeal artists at Heinz Hall, high
culture in the city still remains far above most heads.

As far as the strike goes, it’s hard for the average Pittsburgh worker

7 to conceive of the musicians’ current minimum weekly salary of $305,
let alone to convince" the worker that this amoimt is inadequate under
the present economic strain. '

' No matter what the outcome of the strike, the big loser will be the
alienated public the symphony has been trying so hard to reach and to
convert.

Even if the musicians accept the symphony’s offer, ticket prices will
go up, making the privileged Pittsburghers who can afford to hear the
symphony even more privileged.

Prospects for a wider listening audience may be damaged for some

years to come. And though it’s not solely because of the musicians’

Fear ran rampant. A

In this atmosphere of fear and
hysteria, a young couple, Julius
and Ethel Rosenberg, were arres-
ted and tried for conspiring to steal
the “secret” of the atom bomb.
The Rosenbergs were presumed
guilty by the press and tried by the
hysteria of the times.

On February 8, 1951, about a
month before the actual trial of the
Rosenbergs, a-meeting took place
involving the Joint Congressional
Committee on Atomic Energy,
representatives of the Atomic
Energy Commission, the Justice
Department, and the US Attorney’s
office (which was scheduled to
prosecute the case). The transcript
of this meeting provides the ﬁrst
documentary evidence of an
apparent agreement among high
government and law enforcement ,
officials to manipulate the testi-
mony against the Rosenbergs in
the interest of creating a “big
case,” as one participant put it,
and securing a death sentence.

After their inevitable conviction,

the lives ofthe condemned couple
for their cooperation; cooperation
meant telling the government what
it wanted to hear. Julius and Ethel
maintained their innocence and
refused - to manufacture informa-
tion or falsely implicate others to
save their own lives.

Upon reviewing the facts of the
case, vast numbers of Americans
and Europeans were convinced of
their innocence. Eminent. scien-
tists, such as Dr. Harold ‘C. Urey
and Philip Morrison argued that
there was no atom bomb secret,
that atomic theory was internation-
ally known and described in

l scientific literature. Given the
l evidence presented at the trial, it
seems highly unlikely that the
Russians could have learned
anything new* from
“secrets.” Despite the widespread
fear, thousands of people sent
letters to Washington, protesting
their cruel and inhuman sentence.

The Pope, Pablo Picasso, Albert

citizens pleaded for clemency.

Appeals, protests and legal
actions slowed the process, but on
June 19, 1953, Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg were electrocuted. The
Supreme Court never reviewed the
facts of the case.

From the A death house the
Rosenbergs wrote a ﬁnal letter to
their 10- and 6-year-old sons:

“Your lives must teach you, too,
that good cannot really flourish in
the midst of evil......We wish we
might have had the tremendous joy
of living our lives out with you.
Now that this caimot be......Always
remember that we were innocent
and could not wrong our con-
science.”

Now, 22 years after their death,
Michael and Robert Meeropol, the

Rosenbergs’ sons, have decided to
their support and cooperation, the

Rosenberg Case has been formed--
for public exposure to the truth,
and support of the legal means to
reopen the case.

to establishing their parents’
innocence and changing the condi-
tions that can lead to frame-ups
and cover-"ups in our country.

“We think that the Watergate
revelations of conspiracy, perjury,
and cover-ups in the name of
national security will add credibil-
ity to the case that our parents were
scapegoats, framed by the govern-
ment during a period of anti-
communist hysteria.”

. The iron curtain around this-case
has been lifted.

Paranoia in San Francisco

BY JOHN METCALF E

I recently saw a woman wearing a button imprinted
with the message: “Help! The paranoids are after
me." This is the sort of opposition that has
convinced us that our slogan: “Paranoids can have
real enemies!" is accurate.

We have enemies. The only reason you are
reading this here, and will not ﬁnd it anywhere else,
is the proof. The Establishment is powerful, but it is

not omriipotent. Somehow it has failed to subvert me v

through gifts in cash and drugs and the favors of
persons of my choice. At the same time it has failed
to bend this’ journal to its evil will by placing
expensive advertisements in the names of obvious
dummy companies. This was a mistake.

I have learned a great deal about the
Establishment, mostly through a method I call
Chronomancy. The method is simple; all it requires
is a careful reading of Time in the right frame of
mind, and the underlying realities of everyday life
become clear.

Let me give you an example. Last week's Time.
dated September 29. included the story of the second
attempt upon President Ford's life in September,
though the issue in question had been on newsstands
for four hours when the attempt was made.

It was not, of course, in the usual prose of Time. It
could be read only by the adept; indeed, it may well
be that the alleged perpetrix first learned the details
of her mission from the weekly newsmagazine. All of
us should have been able to read it. I was. So were
the rest of Us. We often are called suspicious, or
peculiar, or even deranged; let the record speak: We
have been exactly right a great many times lately.
Perhaps it is time for the complacent to abandon their
apathetic faith in the pap that is sold to them under
the label of Reality, and join us.

ln Time last week, the clues to the coming.

assassination attempt were so clear as to be perfect
as a first course in Chronomancy. The primary clue
is on page 12. lfyou do not consult a copy of the
lllilgilllllc that has been under your personal control

Elsewhere in the magazine there is a story about the i"“"“*

captgre of Lynette Fromme, who allegedly tried to
shoot,Ford a while back. A

In the illustration with the Hearst story, there are
four white labels on a red map of San Francisco.
They show the locations of: an SLA hideout raided in
l974; the Hibernia Bank, robbed in 1974; the place
where Hearst and her companion were recently
captured, and the apartment where the Harris family
was captured the same day. A number of other
places are noted on the map.

Now the Chronomancy begins. The four locations
mentioned above form a rough rectangle. One of the
other places noted on the map is the St. Francis
Hotel. Nothing in the text suggests any importance
being attached to this hotel, yet it is one of only two
hotels in the city of San Francisco included on the
map. - .

NOW. of course. we know that it was to b.e the site '

of the attempted assassination. Did someone know it
before we did? '

_ Let me proceed. If one takes the rough rectangle

regular; none of the sides is exactly equal to any
other; it is a pentagon, but it is irregular. Pentagon

In addition, the new geometric figure encloses
S0mt‘tlIl.ng the first one did not--the local
headqua.i-ters of the FBI. Can this be dismissed as
mere coincidence?

NOW. at least. you know what is really going on. If

Abortion: Only

Women Decide

The article “Murder by Any
Other Name” in the issue of the
September 24 Pitt News appalled
me and, I am sure, many others.

First, the writer of the article
assumes from the outset that a
fetus is already a living human
being. In his opinion, abortion
“constitutes interference with the

‘jaziell-being of another’s body.” The

writer can hardly presume to
decide this question which is one
that has bafﬂed many leaders in
the medical and religious commun-
ities. As a result, abortion can be
dealt with only as a problem
involving each individual woman
with her own unique situation.
The writer states that “only...
ﬁends could say their offspring so
that they may ‘enjoy a few more
materialistic 1' pleasures.” Unfor-
tunately, the writer does not
consider many of the major reasons
why a woman ever chooses
abortion. Perhaps the child would
be the result of rape; perhaps the
life is endangered;
perhaps she knows that her child

would be deformed. The writer»

attributes to everyone “a rising
tide of immoral conduct.” Yet, to
refuse abortion to a woman who is
confronted with one of the
aforementioned problems reflects
this immorality much more than

Again assuming that a fetus is
identical to a living child, the writer
compares abortion, what he calls a
“mass destruction of innocents,”
to the mass murders of Hitler and
Herod. He then goes on to affirm
“the right to life.” This is a
contradiction, however, for he
advocates birth control in an earlier
paragraph. Through birth control
methods, people still prevent
human beings from being born.

Thus, one who defends the right of p

the unborn and opposes abortion
must also oppose birth control.
Last, I would like to request that
the writer. who will never find
himself in the predicament about
which he writes, act in accordance
with the Mishna Avot II:5: “Do not
judge others until you have been in
their place.” This maxim applies
here more than ‘any other.
Ultimately, only the woman can

‘decide whether the unborn fetus”

should be brought into the world.
Those who are truly compassionate
must recognize this. The woman is

It was inevitable, and every

self knew it. No matter how long it
took him,‘ sooner or later the
Ancient Busman would shufﬂe on
up to your table, dragging his
garbage barrel behind him. And
slowly picking up your half-eaten
lunch, a smile would cross his face
as he waited for you to take notice,
feign panic, and quickly inform him
you were not yet done eating.

John Metcalfe, in his re-inaug-
ural of his “A Column And A

BY KATHRYN KIMBALL

Cyclists can peddle a‘ little easier
now--bike theft on campus has
decreased since last year and‘ the
peak months for the crime have

"passed, according to Campus

Police.
r “Bike thefts have decreased
from last year,” said

 , clothesmen on patrol.

V Students have mixed feelings on

 leaving their bikes on campus while

»I’m always worried about my bike

being stolen,” Wes Morar said.

figures are available yet for
September. -

The hardest hit -areas and
therefore those most heavily
patrolled are the Cathedral
(29.6%), I-Iillman Library (18,5%),
the Quad and the Student Union
(14.8% each). The remaining areas
are scattered around campus.

May and June are obviously the

peak months, and most thefts seem _

to occur at ‘the end of the month.

“There are bound to be thefts in
an urban area but we try to
minimize them," Conte said."‘To
avoid theft, exercise as many

_precautions as possible.”

Conte strongly recommends the
‘case-hardened steel lock presented
by the Student Affairs Office and
backed by Campus Police. “These

‘Where theHeII ’s My Bike?’

locks can’t be cut by the bolt
cutters, which are used to cut
through ordinary combination
locks. They barely dent them.” The
lock is available at the Book Center
for $12.30.

The new bike racks installed
around the University also seem to
deter thefts. They have a metal bar
across the top, as opposed to the
standard type in which the front
wheel of the bike if put into the
rack. According to Come, the

University is in the process of '
purchasing more of the new racks.

Bike owners may register their
bikes with the Campus or County
police. “We have a better chance
of recovering your bike if you’re
registered a serial number with
us,” Conte advised. .

Some students, however, ex-
pressed the desire to see a new
system of bike security on campus.

“They need racks that are
inside,” Tom Sexton said. “I’ve
noticed a few bikes by the Towers
that are left out all night an , could
easily be_ stolen in -the early
morning when no one’s around.”

Gary Goetz agreed, adding that
they also could cut down on theft by
paying someone ,for the purpose of
watching the bikes.

“With the risk of theft de-
creased, more people would ride
bikes and eliminate some of the
traffic caused by so many cars,”
Sexton suggested.

4 A weekly column of AAUP/Pitt News and comment
. , AAIIII Statement oftolleciive Bargaining

' (Prepared by Committee N and approved by the Council in October, 1972. Only the preamble is quoted here.)

,. Collective bargaining, in offering a rational and equitable

- means of distributing resources and of providing recourse
for an aggrieved individual, can buttress and complement
the sound principles and practices of higher education ~
which.the American Association of University Professors
has long supported. Where appropriate, therefore, the Asso-
ciation will pursue collective bargaining as a major addition-
al wayof realizing its goals in higher education, and it will

V V — provide assistance on a selective basis to interested local

 4 f chapters. _

’ As large segments of the American faculty community

manifest an interest in collective bargaining, there is a press-

ing need to develop a specialized model of collective bar— _

gaining in keeping with the standards of higher education.

From its vantage point as the paramount national organiza-

tion in formulating and implementing the principles that

govern relationships of academic life, the Association has

the unique potential, indeed the responsibility, to achieve

through its chapters a mode of collective bargaining consis-

tent with the best features of higher education. To leave the - '

 
 

shaping of collective bargaining to orgznizations lacking the
established dedication to principles developed by the Asso-
ciation and widely accepted by the academic community
endangers those principles. To the extentthat the Associa-

tion is influential in the shaping of collective baigaining, the - .

principles of academic freedom and tenure and the primary
responsibility of a, faculty for determining academic policy
will be secu_red. A ' .

A "The _‘l,on_gstanding programs of the association "are
means‘ to:»fachieve a number of basic ends at colleges and
universities: the enhancement of academic freedom and
tenure; of due process; of sound academic government.
Collective bargaining, properly used, is essentially another
means to achieve these ends, and at the same time to
strengthen the influence of the faculty in the distribution

:of an institution's economic resources. The implementation

of Association-supported principles, reliant upon profes-

sional traditions and upon moral suasion, can be effectively-
supplemented by acollective bargaining agreement and
giventhe force of law. _ ‘ « ‘

The Young Lovelies Stroke

BY BILL MOORE

Smashingly attired in what can
only be described as Rollerball-
glitter, they skated into the Towers
lobby and the hearts of drunken
Pitt students last weekend, and
then skated right back out again.

The long-legged, panty-hosed
pair, immune to the numerous
slurs concerning their sanitv and
sexual preferences, slipped and
slid their gaudy way across the tile
Towers floor to the cheers of the
thrilled spectators, in hopes of
starting another in a long line of
useless campus fads, and convin-
cing Chancellor Wesley Posvar to
give students more football tickets.

Stroking--as in streaking, only .

more suggestive‘--is the name given
the athletic, if a bit perverse,

pastime, and according to the"

Young Lovelies, the only known

Strokers at this time, it is as much '

fun--no, more fun--than it looks.

The Young Lovelies, resplendent
in halter tops, silver hair, black
hose and‘ skates, explained last
Friday what Stroking is:

“It is something we did. No
reason, really. We’re not gay,
although people would like to think
we are, we are just stupid,”
explained Ray ' Gunne, as he
checked to make sure his lightning

bolt -make-up remained unsmear- ~

e .

Gunne’s Stroking companion,
Jet Black, offered a second opinion.
“Listen, love,’’ he explained in his
poor imitation of an English accent,
“You’ve heard of streaking, well
this is stroking. We are the ﬁrst
and the last of the strokers.”

The Young Lovelies are convin-
ced the Pitt student body is ready
to forget books and resume the real
college traditions, be it phone-
booth swallowing or cramming
fraternity brothers into a goldﬁsh.

The Lovelies’ Friday night debut
began in front of Hillman Library.

‘King’ Exits at Lab Theatre

BY TOBI ROSEN

The Pittsburgh Laboratory
Theatre has discovered a new way
to celebrate the Bicentennial.
There are no powder-puff wigs in
this show, just a black-cloaked
harbinger warning of America's
“ﬁnal hour.”

Exit the King, loosely based on

,Eugene Ionesco’s text, has been

adapted andirewritten a la Daniel
Berrigan, as a more suitable
vehicle for the Lab Theatre. The
story revolves around the death of
the American materialistic system
and the reactions of each different
class to this phenomena.

America, with all her men on the
moon, stands strong and tall like
the Statue of Liberty holding that
damn torch through wind and ﬁre.
Her flame just won’t go out.

But soon that ﬂame will become
a slight flicker, the victim of an
apparent suicide. Yes, America
brought it on her-(or in this case,
him) self, says the Lab Theatre.
But why now? Why after 200 years

 has America ﬁnally buckled under

the pressure of her people’s
unrest? .

To my own satisfaction, this
question was never properly

answered. In order for a king to

remain in power, he must preside
over those who are willing to serve.

Everyone in this menagerie, from
the beautiful Queen Marie to the
working-class Juliette, are respon-
sible for the king’s position. They
adhere to the power structure.

    

Jim Krut as King -Berenger in
the Pittsburgh Laboratory
theatre’s production of Exit the
King.

— But with little cause or reason,
dissent runs like a rabid dog,
infecting all of those in its path.
Each class (from the professionals
on down) erupts at the inadequa-
cies in its feeble leader.

But the king stumbled upon one
profoundity typical of both this play
and production. ?‘Today it is
normal to be abnormal,” he
proclaims. And so the Pittsburgh
Laboratory Theatre integrates this
proposal into its structure and
succeeds. We’re handed platefuls
of environmental seating experi-
ments, metaphorical red, white and
blue lighting and costume effects,
Christ ﬁgures and a smorgasbord
of other off-off-Broadway gimmick
whose sole purpose is to create
effects merely for the sake of ﬁlling
time and space.

As the king winds his way down
into the death pit, the place of the
audience in this spectacle becomes
obscure. Were we suppo_sed to feel
sympathy? Empathy? Anything?

I strongly believe that each
audience member has the capacity
to arrive at his own decision,
provided that some history on
which a rationale can be based is
offered in either text or production..

visually exciting yet thematically
confusing piece.

Most of the conﬂict arose from

'Futurama':
Hard-hitting
English Rock

BY BOB WINE

Futurama, Be  Bop Deluxe

Harvest (ST-11432)

This is one HELL of an excellent
record. Be + Bop Deluxe is a new
sound to American eyes (this is its
ﬁrst release here and the second in
England). The hard-hitting rock is
in the continental style of, Roxy
Music, middle Bowie, and Sparks,
but less frenetic and more
accessible.

The front man of Be-l-Bop

~ Deluxe is Bill Nelson. He is one of

the most dynamic and brilliant
guitarists around. He plays every
guitar part and dominates the
"album with his instrument. His
electric solos are crisp, piercing
and tastefully executed. If you like
electric lead guitar, British style,
this album is definitely for you.

Suddenly the elevator door

respect and a slight awe as our

costs run as high as $75-100,000).
Because her father could not
continue this season, Karp was
called in to help with the huge
amount of work involved in the
opera.

When asked to define the term
opera in her own words she made it
clear opera is “not just another
form of entertainment” but a deep,
emotionally involving experience,
but still entertaining to the public.

The traditional early operas were
staged in one style where the
singer planted himself downstage
center and sang his own little aria.
These series of solos were loosely
connected by recitatives. In the
nineteenth century the operas were
more fluid but contained no sense

The strike, stemming from wage

negotiators failed to improve their
offer.

package offered included a $90-

Symphony musicians currently
receive $305 a week. '
Osgood termed the package

“inadequate.”
The union has made no
counter offer, Osgood said. “We

are waiting for the symphony
management to improve their offer
in the new talks,” he said.
Osgood explained that $40 of the
proposed wage increase would be
for extra recording Work to be
added to the symphony schedule.
“We believe the recording work
should be an independent part of
the package.” L
Rosen said the musicians would
be guaranteed the money even if
the recording did not take place.

of dramatic structure on stage.
They were not aware of acting
values. -

, In the last ten years Americans
have become more involved with
the dramatic elements of opera.
Simple arias do not suffice.
“Audiences today are more so-
phisticated," Karp said. “They
expect a lot and won’t sit still for
the old fashioned.

“Also, the director has come to
achieve more prominence,”Karp
said. “The field was traditionally
dominated by men. Women were
limited to so called “feminine
fields like choreography.
directoral world today there are not
a great deal of women.” I sensed a
certain pride in the fact that she
has helped to pioneera wide-open
frontier.

The next thing we knew, a man.

was standing beside us with a little
girl, wondering if we could keep an
eye on her for a minute. Wow, I
thought, there goes the interview.
But Karp took it in stride and as
she bent down and lifted the little
girl on her. lap with a touch of
motherly concern, I discovered yet
another clue to her mu',lti-faceted
personality. » ~ '

Now, back to the subject of
opera.

‘In the ‘

“Yes, nowadays American sing-
ers are more trained than ever
before,” she said. “Problems do
arise because singing is an
international art; the way opera is
done varies from country to
country. ‘ “In Pittsburgh guest
artists fly in 3 days ahead of time so
we try to be faster and more
emphatic in trying to achieve the
kind of performance we have in
mind. The singers’ travel with their
roles in a suitcase so to speak.”

“Isn't your title ‘artistic director’
a little broad?” I pressed on,
“What do you actually do?"

“I’m involved with casting,
staging and directing; in other
words, the artistic aspects of the
opera rather than funding or
publicity," Karp said.

“What if someone was inter-
ested in exactly what you do, how
do they prepare for such a career?”

“First, get the broadest kind of
base possible. For operatic stage

directing learn the repertoire, learn ‘

different languages, get a lot of
musical background, theater ex-
perience, and do everything
ﬁrsthand, as much as possible.”
Karp practices what she preach-
es. She is an accomplished concert
pianist with a degree in acting and
a degree in music from Boston
University. She studied music,
acting, directing, dance‘ and

Men's Suits

Dry Cleaned
and Handfinished

choreography in New York, Boston,
Cleveland, Hartford, London, Italy
and Germany. In 1974 she received
the Gamma-Fisher Grant of the
National Opera Institute in Direct-

ing, which enabled her to serve an /6»

internship in directing in the New
York City Opera Company. (For
those interested people there are
also internships and courses
avilable at various universities
around the country.) This season
she will be directing Carmen, The
Crucible and Madame Butterfly in
Pittsburgh.

Karp’s eyes ﬂashed when I
asked her about the issue of federal
funding for the arts. “The arts are
a part of American tradition.
They’ve never had a proper
subsidy. In Europe the govern-
ment, state or region, and city all
give "money for the support of the
arts. ,

“Here in Pittsburgh we give six
shows a year, twelve performances
in all. European opera_companies
are function eleven out of the
twelve months in a year. They
have children's theater and educa-
tional programs to bring the live
arts into the schools and allow the
arts to become part of their
educational and cultural tradition.
The nurturing of the arts is not too
well developed here in the United
States." '

surfaced in our conversation.
Premise: There aren’t any. __
Reason: Because the opera is 
supported by an older generation '
with power to demand the familiar
favorites. Karp has a tremendous
eye for the future and would like tc
do more contemporary works but
“only if we can get the support of
the younger audience."

One Hell of a Record

(Continued from Page 9)

Nelson also writes all the music
lyrics on the record, and
handles the lead vocals.

In every aspect he succeeds with
flying colors. I don't want to leave
out the rest of the members of the
group, who all equally excellent.
Charles Tumahai on bass and
Simon Fox on drums and percus-
sion lend a powerhouse backing
that can't be ignored. The
production is handled expertly by
Roy Thomas Baker (of Queen fame)

, ',-and he gives a rich, thunderous

feeling to the entire record.
Nelson’s songwriting style is
very complex, with a number of
different songs within songs, a la
McCartney. Almost every song
begins with an intro hook lasting
about 25 seconds, which includes
interesting guitar licks and melod-
ies later repeated throughout the
song. Although complex, the
melodies are catchy and the songs
themselves rarely extend past

three or four minutes, so they
easily stick in the mind.

Together the group is simply
superb. The standout cuts, where
the combination of music, lyrics,
searing guitar work and production
is really amazing include “Maid in
Heaven" (A catchy little rocker
that would make an ideal single),
“Sister Seagull” (which has a great
intro full of different guitar tricks),
“Sound Track” (featuring Nelson's
soaring guitars dueling each other
on separate tracks in two-minute
fadeout) and “Swan Song” (rem-
iniscent of Bowie's Ziggy Stardust
period

All in all, Nelson (in particular)

and Be+Bop Deluxe are brilliant.

Well, the way everyone ’ is
looking toward the Duke game this
Saturday, it must be the beginning
of a new season. The ﬁrst three
games were either exhibition or
were played to take up slack in the
schedule. ,

“This is a very important game
for us this week,” said Head Coach
Johnny Majors at the weekly
football luncheon. The first three
games were against highly differ-
ent opponents. Georgia was a good
football team, Oklahoma was an
extremely powerful football team
and William and Mary was a‘ weak
football team. “This week we_ will
find out just what kind of football
team we have,” Majors said.

Duke, although it has a 1-2
record, is capable of playing good

wasn't really that bad a defeat, USC
hasn’t lost a game yet this season.
In their second game, the Dukes
lost to South Carolina, 24-16, in a
game that was close all the way.
Then last week in one of those big
college rivalries, ‘the Blue Devils
smashed Virginia, 26-11.

“We’re basically an inexperi-
enced team,” said Duke Head
Coach Mike McGee.

“We’ve had trouble in our
defensive secondary and at the
defensive tackle position. The
defense has been improving and
the offensive blocking has been
getting better, but we have a lot of
room for improvement.”

Defense has been what Duke
teams -of the past have lived on.
McGee was a famous lineman for
the Blue Devils in the late Fifties
and won the coveted Outland
Trophy in 1959 as the outstanding
lineman in the country. ’

Although this year the defense.
has a lot of rebuilding to do, it still,
has key personnel that can givethe
Panthers headaches.

“)Ernie) Clark at right end is a
very good man and Dave Meier at
middle linebacker is excellent,”
Majors said.

Safety Laniel Crawford is anoth-
er of the key personnel on defense
who have talent plus "a lot of
playing time. _

Offensively the Blue Devils are
balanced.

for Panthers

“In their first three games, the
Duke team has been averaging 142
yards per game,” said Defensive
Backfield Coach Joe Madden.
“Split end Troy Slade has been
averaging 15.6 yards per catch for

10 receptions and is indeed an --

excellent receiver. Chuck Wil-
liamson at swingback is a good
runner while quarterback Bob

‘Corbett, who came into his own

against Virginia, is an impressive
quarterback, completing 54% of
his passes this year.

“Duke will deﬁnitely be the best
throwing team we have faced yet
and will be a challenge for our
secondary.”

On the other side of the offensive
coin, the Dukes ain’t hurtin’ either._

Fullback Tony Benjamin, who
played his high-school ball at
nearby Monessen, has picked up 82
yards on 20 carries this season.
Benjamin is also an excellent

I blocker.

Tailback--Duke uses the I-forma-
tion--is considered one of the most
sound areas on the Blue Devil
team. Art Gore is the big man at
this position but suffered an ankle
injury against Virginia and is listed
as a doubtful starter.

However, behind him are Larry
Martinez, second on the team

. (behind Gore) in yards rushed this

year with 88, and Bob Pruitt
(cousin_of former Oklahoma star
Greg), a talented sophomore.

Booters Kick CM-U, 3-1

football. Losing to Southern
California, 35-7, in its opener
BY TOM HALL

ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR

Poor passing, ineffective
shots, absurd ﬁeld conditions, and

un upcoming match with Temple‘
were just some of the reasons the

Pitt soccer team had such a poor
showing in yesterday’s 3-1 win over
the hapless Tartans of Carnegie-
Mellon University.‘

“All that can be said,” Coach
Leo/Bemis lamented, “is that we
played a very mediocre game.
C-MU always gets up for us, being
our next-door neighbor, and as
long as they were in the game they
kept ﬁghting.”

All the scoring took place in the
first and last ﬁve minutes of the
match. C-MU drew ﬁrst blood,
scoring from the middle of the Pitt
defense. «

“We really took these guys for
granted,” said middle wing Andy
Behrend. “I felt the first goal was
mostly my fault. They just slipped
in through our zone, right where I
was supposed to be.”

- Down one to zip, the Panthers
got down to playing soccer. Less
than two minutes later, senior
co-captain Al Jutca took a pass
from the wing slot and tapped the
ball passed the C-MU goalie.

With the score tied at 1-1, Pitt
spent much of the ﬁrst half in the
C-MU defensive secondary. Errant
passing, numerous offside calls
and good defense by the ﬁred-up
Tartans accounted for the low
score. »

The Pitt thrust was broken only
occasionally by C-MU offensive
bursts. The Pitt defensive

alignment handled itself well,
turning back the Tartan drives and
returning the ball to the other end
of the ﬁeld with apparent ease. A
good, concrete Pitt offense faltered
only when it came down to putting
the ball in the net.

“Our shooting was not good at
all today,” Bemis said. “I would
blame a lot of that‘ on the field. It
was really torn up. Mostly, we
lacked real hustle.”

Behrend, who seemed to spend
much of the game on the ground,
echoed his coach’s sentiments.
“that was the bumpiest ﬁeld I’ve
ever had to play‘ on. We are pretty
much of a passing team, and that
really slowed us down.” '

The second half of the contest
was much like an instant replay of
the ﬁrst. Pitt was almost always in
the C-MU half of the ﬁeld, and
when it came time for the Panthers
to shut off the C-MU attack, the
defensemen, Ernie Gross in _parti-
cular, sent the Tartans running.

For at limited-contact sport,
which soccer is supposed to be, this
one was a physical game. “Those
guys were extra rough today,” said
right wing forward John Curley.
“They always play tough against
us, and today, as long as they were
in the game, we were really getting
beat up.” ‘ ”

The C-MU goalie bit the dust
early in the second stanza and had
to be replaced. Another C-MU
player was ejected from the game
for ﬁghting with Pitt’s Craig
O’Connally. Numerous minor
injuries were sustained by players
from both teams.

With a little more than ﬁve
minutes left in the contest, the Pitt

offense clicked once more to break
the deadlock. A Curley pass
eluded the C-MU goalie in front of
the net, and Bob Graham slipped in
from the other side to tap in the
winning goal.

In a desperate attempt to tie the
contest, the Tartans forgot to play
defense, and the brief lapse cost
them again. Another Curley pass
found its way to the front of the
C-MU line, and Louie Nigh tapped
it in.

‘‘It was just a sloppy contest all
around,” Bemis said. “We just
didn’t take charge out there like we
should have. Our passing was
really poor today. You should
remember, though, we were all
looking forward to the Temple
game, and we shouldn’t have.
C-MU is always up for us, and It's
getting to be a real rivalry.

Curley, who spent the ﬁrst 15
minutes after the game rubbing
ointment on his battered calves,
reiterated that viewpoint.

“We just took these guys for
granted, and it could have cost us
the game. They don’t go after the
ball, they go after you. They don’:
use much finesse. They just kicl
the hell out of you, and we found
ourselves playing their game.

“This is probably a good time fox
a bad game.” Curley said. “We
just didn’t havethe hustle out thert
today. I know we were looking
forward to Temple.”

Means Bucci

BY STEVE SYBERT

Those of you who think being a
soccer goalie is easy--doing nothing
but grabbing soft shots out of the
air--had better sit down and read
on.
Sure he has to stop soft shots,
but let’s not forget the hard shots,

and the stoved fingers and bruises ,

they cause. And let’s not forget the
goalie must also be ..a good
“punter” and “quarterback,” too,
if he hopes to make it in the nets.
Sophomore Frank Bucci, goalie
for the Pitt soccer team, believes
having these qualiﬁcations and
others separate the good goalies
from the_bad. -

The Pitt booters have little
chance to play before a hometown
“crowd.” The students stay away
in droves. Attendance usually runs
about 200 for a home game.

One of the problems is the lack of
publicity. Another is the caliber of

play. .
The latter is being rectified
quickly.

“This is the best team we’ve had
since I’ve been here,” Murphy
said. “We’re getting good players

But, once again, there is a lack of
money.

especially adverse responses from
Slippery Rock.

But Gordon obviously knew the
script; it was the Pantherettes’
show, as they sealed “The Rock”
successfully for the ﬁrst time,
winning six of seven matches.

‘“I think, they’re just what I
expected,” Gordon said. “They’re
good and they can do it all. I think
every match was really nice and
they really put forth a lot of effort.”

Gordon went with her usual
lineup in singles: Paris, Anouk
Sassouni, Fran Baskin and Mary
Sue Ramsden. Doubles were Jan
Conway and Jan Irwin, Ann
Seebold and Terry Lies, Debbie‘
Zabinski and Beth Secousky.

The Pantherettes totally domi-
nated the doubles; in almost every
set, the Rockettes would start out
well, then suddenly crumble.

Seebold and Lies, the only Pitt
doubles team announced prior to
the contest, played while the
singles went on and ﬁnished with
the closest scores, 7-5 and 6-2.

“They just fell apart,” Seebold
commented. “They just got too
nervous and made a lot of bad
shots.” -

First and third doubles (Conway
and Irwin, Zabinski and Secousky)
obliterated the Rockettes by the
same scores, 6-1 and 6-1.

separate entry, preferring to
regard it as an offshoot of the
physical education program.
Therefore, recruiting is nonexistent
for the Rockettes and no athletic
scholarships are offered.

Slippery Rock Head Coach Helen
Knierin objected to the practice so
many other colleges have adopted,
stating that scholarship recipients
too often are given priorities in
playing over the others, often
undeservedly.

“We want to let as many girls as
possible play,” Knierin said while
pacing the sidelines. “We don’t
even have tuition waivers.

“It's going to make it tough with
some of the schools offering
scholarships,” she added, darting
a quick but obvious glance to the
far court where Maria Paris was
demolishing Donna Costa.

Knierin was also critical of the
publicity given Paris and of the
coaching procedures of Pitt Coach
Nancy Gordon.

Gordon did not announce her
first and third doubles teams until
after the singles competition ended
and her early plans to repeatdrew

Wilmot, 6-3 and 6-4, then came
through with the final 6-1 win.

Baskin breezed past Cindi
Nadelman in the ﬁrst set, 6-1, but
had a tough ﬁght in the second,
coming out on top, 7-5.

The focus was, of course, on
Paris. ‘

Paris did not play as well as she
could have; occasionally her game
was careless and at times her
concentration was not intent. It
didn’t matter.

She overpowered Costa from the
start, almost effortlessly gliding to
a 6-0,6-0 victory.

And Paris lived up to expecta-
tions; her showmanship was one of
the high points of the afternoon.
She has the cool veneer of a true
superstar, accuracy even the
Rockettes commented on, a serve
praised by the Triangles’ Peggy
Michaels, and the greatest foot-
work since Gene Kelly tap danced
through Singing in the Rain.

‘‘I played with my head instead
of my raquet,” Paris said. “I was
very nervous--I had everything to

lose. A good player is always
nervous.” .

“I was nervous,” put in Baskin.
“Sure, you have to be.”

“He was wonderful,” said Joe

Veteran reporter Maury

Allen wrote, “He is gone and I am
supposed to cry, but I laugh.
Everytime I saw the man, every
time I heard his voice, every time
his name was mentioned, the
creases of my mouth would give
way and a smile would come to my
face.”

The man is Charles Dillon
Stengel, baseball’s irrepressible

“He knew what to do with the
talent he had,” said DiMaggio, the

on the first three World Series

“He understood his players. I
enjoyed playing under him.”

Stengel, who was 85 last July 30,
died late Monday night of cancer,
an ailment he hid from the world
until the day of his death.

Funeral arrangements for the

known as “Stengelese” were

must be able to work as a unit in
order to play well.”

Soccer Coach Leo Bemis also
stresses the importance of building
up confidence.

“He (Bucci) has a certain
amount of confidence already,”
Bemis said. “But as the defense
gains experience in front of him, he
will attain more and become a
better goalie as a result.”

» some work,” Bemis said.

Most
hockey goalies took up their jobs
because they couldn’t skate or
shoot well enough to be forwards.
Soccer goalies are usually those
who.couldn’t kick. Bucci went
through that experience as a senior
in high school.

“The kids around Bethel Park
asked me to try goalie,” said Bucci,
“because I couldn’t kick the ball
around too well.
playing goalie and I like it there.”

Bucci insists the goalie’s tough-
est job, as it is in hockey, is cutting
down the angle of the oncoming
shooter.

“You want to give the shooter as
small a target as you can for him to
shoot at. It’s the same thing in
hockey. You have to come out of
the net. The farther you come out,
the less he has to shoot for.”

Bemis feels if Bucci has a weak
spot in his game, it is in his
quarterbacking, that is, his short
passing.

“His short throwing game needs
‘(He
tends to throw the ball to the other
team too much. But improvement
will come with experience and
Frank has this year and two more in‘
which to develop his skills.”

If Bucci is weak in the passing
department, he makes up for it in
his punting...er, I mean his drop
kicking, consistently booting the
ball past midﬁeld-after stopping
shots. But Bucci is not yet
completely satisfied.

“Last year, I was really
inconsistent in hitting the ball,” he
said. “This year, I’m a lot better. I
still need some work on it, but I’m
satisfied with how it’s been going
so far.”

Bucci already has turned in two
shutouts this season--versus Akron
and Edinboro--and could have had
a third if not for a mix-up in signals
with a fullback. E

Late in the game against
Bucknell, a loose ball rolled near
the Panther goal. The fullback
thought Bucci was going to get it
and Bucci thought the fullback was
going to. get it. So who got it?
Right. A Bucknell player got it and
booted in the winning goal. I

“That was due to a lack of
communication between the both of
us,” Bucci explained. “Those
things happen. I know there are
mistakes that aren’t mine and goals
scored off those mistakes. But

I actually, we were both to blame.”

Teamwork is important in soccer, I

as it is in all team-oriented sports, '

especially between the goalie and
the fullbacks in front of him. ’

“It’s true _that sometimes I pick
up the defense, but more than
often, the defense picks me up
too,” Bucci said. “It’s important
that we work together,”

Okay. Now, who_still thinks the
goalie’s job is easy‘?
