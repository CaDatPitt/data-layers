Apartheid pros, cons voiced

By David James
Staff Writer

The administration of Carnegie-
Mellon University held a teach-in last
night on the ongoing situation in South
Africa and its implications for the call
for divestment on university campuses
around the country.

Students. faculty and interested
members of the Pittsburgh communi-

and discussion sessions with people
who oppose the current government
and a representative of South -Africa
whospoke in defense of his nation‘s
political system.

Dr. Kent Brown. a white South
African. contended that the problems
in his country are not racially based.

The general conception that is
familiar in this country and other coun-
tries as well is that the problems there
are problems of race. We see them as
cultural differences.” he said.

Brown argued that, although the
South African government sees apart-

heid as an outdated system, there are
cultural and social complexities which
make it CllfflCLlli to eliminate. He said
that the 30 percent of all South African
blacks who live in cities is too small
a proportion to justify political
integration. ’

“The whites, coloreds and Indians
are highly urbanized,“ he said,
"whereas with the blacks. only 30 per-
cent live in cities."

This 30 percent constitutes approx-
imately eight million blacks.

The rest of the black African popula-
tion, according to Brown, cannot be
treated as a single social entity to be
integrated as one group. “We cannot
look at the blacks and say they are just
black,” Brown said. "You don’t call

all Europeans whites, you call them

Frenchmen and Germans."

Cultural diversity among the rural
blacks, Brown argued, impedes any
quick solution to the social and political
inequalities they live under. “They

have chiefs, visit witch doctors and

pratice polygamy," Brown said. “We

don’t want to de-tribalize these people
by force.”

Both Carnegie-Mellon University
and the University of Pittsburgh have
investments of approximately $20
million each in companies which do
business in South Africa. Both univer-
sities have balked at total divestment.

Here at Pitt, as well as at other
universities, one often-heard argument
against divestment is that money in
South Africa gives the United States
leverage to push the South African
government. But according to Robert
Schwartz, vice president of Shearson-
Lehman Bros. investment firm. this is
a weak argument.

Schwartz, who has 15 years ex-
perience in the area of socially-
responsive investment, said, “It has
been my experience that the blacks in
South Africa overwhelmingly want
foreign capital out of the country.”

The contention that the companies
are providing valuable employment for
South African blacks does not hold
water, said Schwartz.

Pitt prof appointed  
space agency head

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

Dr. James Fletcher. a faculty
member in Pitt's School of Engineer-
ing, has been appointed by President
Reagan to the position of administrator
of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. Fletcher's appointment
will be reviewed for confirmation by
the Senate in four or five weeks. ac-
cording to Pitt officials.

Fletcher. administrator of NASA
from 1971 to 1977, is the Distinguished
Public Service Professor of Engineer-
ing and Technology at Pitt. He joined
Pitt in 1977 as the William K.
Whiteford Professor of Technology
and Energy Resources, then assumed
his current position in 1984.

The position of administrator at
NASA became vacant in early February
when James M. Beggs stepped down in
response to pressure from President
Reagan and the American public.
Beggs was the target of charges that he
and three other current or former
General Dynamics Corp. executives
tried to defraud the government by
hiding cost overruns on the ill—fated
Sgt. -York anti-aircraft gun. .

When the space shuttle Challenger
exploded on Jan. 28, the worst accident
in the history of the space program,
tremendous criticism was directed at
Beggs for permitting the mission to be
carried out despite warnings of unsafe
conditions. Nevertheless, Beggs said he
resigned primarily because of the
allegations against him concerning the
cost overruns.

As head of NASA, Fletcher super-

vised the Space Shuttle program from

its beginnings in 1972 until he left in
1977. Pitt officials said Fletcher was
appointed to the position because of his
experience and expertise. Fletcher
reported directly to President Reagan
in 1973 when he was chairman of the

During his career Fletcher has work
with companies doing electronics and
guided missile research as well as
developing patents in sonar and missile

New education dean plans improvements of program

By John Zaphyr

Assistant News Editor

UCLA and Pitt are a nation apart,
but both universities have something in
common.

Thomas La Belle, the new dean of
the School of Education, came to Pitt
from UCLA last month. La Belle
served as an associate dean of the
graduate division of UCLA‘s School of
Education for more than five years and
brings many of the school’s ideas and
practices to Pitt.

“My background at UCLA is with
shared governance where the faculty
and the administration try to reach a
consensus on major issues and major
approaches." said La Belle. “And I
think that's the main thing I bring from
UCLA.”

One way La Belle is trying to bring

the faculty and administration closer
together is by combining the jobs of
teachers and administrators into one
position. Except for La Belle himself
and the Faculty Council representative.
each of the education school adminis-
trators will devote half his time to ad-
ministrative duties and half to research
and teaching.

“Once you are an administrator it is
very difﬁcult to move back into the
classroom," said La Belle. “The idea
of a shared appointment of part-
administrator and part-research
scholarship is that it sets you as a
member of the community and it
doesn‘t put you apart from the faculty
and students.

“So, increasing the number of peo-
ple who are administrators, but keep-
ing their time divided. will hopefully
bring the two together," he continued.

However, the joining of the two posi-
tions may also lessen the effectiveness

of both the teachers and the adminis-
trators. La Belle, however, sees the ad-
vantages as outweighing the disadvan-
tages. .

“There’s all kinds of trade-offs."
said La Belle. “It’s more important to
have a rapport with the faculty, and it’s
more important that you not lose con-
tact with your own scholarship
research.

“It’s very tough to find real talented
people to join administrative groups.”
he continued, “and if you offer them
the opportunity that they can continue
doing their own research, you may
draw more talented people. The most
talented people want that — they don't
want to leave their careers."

Also. La Belle plans to change the
teacher education program from a four-
year school to a ﬁve-year program.
Currently, a student enters the educa-
tion program as a freshman majoring
in education. That student receives a

bachelor’s degree in education and is
certified as a teacher as an undergrad-
uate. La Belle wishes to alter that plan.

“The plan now would be that we’ll
move from a four-year program to
where a student will major in a
discipline, say mathematics, and will
receive a bachelor's degree in that
discipline and then come into teacher
education and receive a certiﬁcate,”
said La Belle.

Why the change? La Belle cites
several reasons.

“Over the last few years there has
been a number of national studies on
education and one of the concerns is to
enhance the quality of primary and
secondary education," he said. “And
every one of those reports suggested
that a way to combat the problems is
to provide more subject matter educa-
tion of future teachers.

‘ ‘This move [to a ﬁve-year program]
will attempt to increase the subject mat-

ter education and also increase the
status of the teaching profession by giv-
ing a B.A. in a speciﬁc subject. And,
hopefully, it will increase the student’s
preparations for teaching in schools.’ ’

La Belle said he plans to provide a
more detailed curriculum by using
highly specialized instructors in both
the areas of education and classroom
work. Several teachers who have vast
experience in the classroom will lec-
ture on how to communicate with both
the students and the families of
students. Hopefully, according to La
Belle, this will help the students
become better teachers.

Although the shift to a ﬁve-year pro-
gram does have its advantages, it also
has its drawbacks, La Belle said.

“The move to the ﬁve-year plan may
cut off more minorities from coming
into the teaching profession,” said La
Belle. “And we have to think of ways

MOSCOW —- The Soviet Union is
formally protesting the U.S. order to
reduce the size of the Soviet U.N. mis-
sion by 40 percent. It ripped the order
as "totally inadmissible" and said it
harms the prospects for a new super-
power summit. The verbal protest was
delivered in Moscow. A statement
warns of what it terms “direct
damage" to U.S.—Soviet relations. The
official TASS News Agency referred
to the order as “illegitimate."

Philippines finds
hidden properties

MANILA, Philippines — An official
of the new Philippine government said
the Aquino administration has found
documents linking deposed President
Marcos to more hidden real estate
properties in New York. They include
a hotel, an office building and con-
dominiums. Marcos’ wealth in New
York is already estimated at $350
million.

South Africa keeps
CBS reporters

South Africa — The South African
government today reversed its expul-

sion order of three‘ CBS reporters. The
reporters were ordered to leave the
country because of the airing of a
clandestine film, shot at a mass funeral
from which television cameras were
banned. No details of the reversal are
available. An official announced the
lifting of the expulsion order after four
meetings between CBS and Home Af-
fairs Minister Stoffel Botha.

U.S. adds names to
Vietnam monument

WASHINGTON — The names of
108 American servicemen who died
outside the official combat zone dur-
ing the Vietnam War are being added
to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
The president of the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial Fund said the group is con-
ducting a nationwide search for the
families of the Vietnam War dead to
invite them to a Memorial Day Service
at the monument in May.

State Department
loses ruling on visas

WASHINGTON — A Washington
federal appeals court has ruled that the
State Department cannot deny visas to

foreigners invited to speak in the
United States simply because they are
communists or anti—American. The de-
cision by the District of Columbia Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals came in cases in-
volving four aliens — Nicaragua’s in-
terior minister. Italian peace activist
Nino Pasti and two Cuban women. All
four were refused temporary visas. The
court ruled that Congress intended the
government to justify exclusion of
aliens by citing more than their political
membership.

Reagan presses
foreign arms deals

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan is sticking with his full request
for $100 million in aid to arm
Nicaraguan rebels. White House
spokesman Larry Speakes said there
will be “no compromise," and
anything less than the full aid package
would be “a halfway measure.”

Speakes also said the President has
decided to formally notify Congress of
his intention to sell additional air
defense missiles to Saudi Arabia. The
advanced missiles are part of a $324
million arms deal the administration
said must be approved to meet “valid
security requirements."

Shuttle replacement
vital, NASA says

WASHINGTON — NASA chief
William Graham said the shuttle
Challenger cost the United States $3.2
billion to build. but a replacement for
the lost orbiter will cost only about $2.8
billion. Speaking to a House panel to-
day. Graham said that if Challenger is
not replaced. it will leave NASA with
a payload backlog equivalent to 24
flights by 1990. So far, NASA has not
formally asked Congress to replace the
shuttle that exploded just 73 seconds
after launch on Jan. 28.

Astronauts agree
with Young’s memo

CAPE CANAVERAL. Fla. —
Three veteran astronauts agreed public-
ly today with the thrust of complaints
aired last week by Chief Astronaut
John Young. In a memo to NASA.
Young accused shuttle program

Tanagers of putting the launch
schedule ahead of flight safety. Gor-
don Fullerton agreed yesterday that the
pendulum swung too far to the side of
meeting schedules when the emphasis
was placed on launches every month.

Gun law bill
debated on hill

WASHINGTON — The House
Judiciary Committee has approved a
controversial bill permitting interstate
sales of shotguns and riﬂes but barring

cross—state sales of handguns. The

measure was sent to the House floor,
where it could be brought up as early
as next week. A fight is expected on
relaxing the nation's gun laws. New
Jersey representative Peter Rodino said
he was disappointed there was not
enough support in committee to require
a waiting period before a person could
purchase a handgun.

“Any time you create a change, you
are always into costs and benefits, and
I think the beneﬁts outweigh the

La Belle was born in Wisconsin but
moved to Los Angeles at an early age.
He has also spent time in New Mexico
and in Latin America. With such a
varied and exotic background, why did
he choose Pittsburgh?

“I chose Pittsburgh because I was
looking for an opportunity in a school
of education that seemed to be on the
move,” La Belle said. “And I think
under President Posvar and Provost

.Benjamin’s leadership. they have
challenged the School of Education to

La Belle said he hopes to see that top
ranking during his tenure at Pitt, which
will be accomplished through many
changes. His vision of the School of
Education is a much different picture
from the current model.

“The school is going to be much
smaller," La Belle said. “I think we
will have shifted the balance from prac-
tice to more research and scholarship.
Hopefully, we will have recruited the
best students, and we will be able to
fund them.

“We will become more of a
graduate-oriented program, but we will
be offering special courses and
seminars for undergraduates to explore
education as a profession, but not
necessarily tied to certification.

“I hope that the school will be
looked at nationally as a leading school
of education and that we will increase
the amount of money we have for
research and scholarships. And, in
general. I want our program to be a
stronger. higher quality. tighter pro-
gram."

Failed Rescue

City Public Safety Director John J. Nor-
ton announced plans Monday to improve the
city river rescue team in response to last
week’s botched rescue attempt by the Police
River Patrol of a man who had jumped from
the 62nd Street Bridge. In the tragedy last
Tuesday, two policemen, mistakenly assum-
ing the man was dead, dragged him through
the river for roughly a mile before
paramedics removed him from the icy
waters. The victim, Peerce Platt, was revived
at St. Francis Medical Center but later died.

This effort, and another near failure to
rescue a woman from the Allegheny River
on Jan. 14, pointedly demonstrated the in-
adequacies of the River Patrol and the need
for greater emphasis on basic rescue tech-
niques. City officials have responded by
developing a plan that establishes a new two-
boat rescue team now manned by trained
paramedics in addition to city policemen.

The city is to be commended for the alacri-
ty with which it acted to rectify the short-
comings of the River Patrol. This does not,
however, release it from culpability for the
inept way in which the drowning last week
was handled. The new Public Safety River
Patrol unit might indeed prove to be an ir-
reproachable service. But the fate of drown-
ing victim Peerce Platt will forever sting the
collective consciences of city planners.

Conservation-
Minded

I and a cohort, whilst strolling
through the William Pitt Union,
wandered across a wonderful display
of college awareness. Unselfishly.
nearly all of the Pitt students had left
behind their recyclable aluminum soft
drink cans. Obviously. the “recycle
America" campaign has struck home
here at Pitt. The majority of our co-eds
had taken up the unselfish task of mak-
ing sure that nary an aluminum can
should be wasted in the trash. It deep-
ly touched our hearts that our fellow
students should have such concern. We
appreciate the thought that must go in-
to saving all these cans but. dammit.
we would like to be able to sit down
to a clean table.

believe that if they wanted to see a
woman. they would have asked her
out. Still others think that a woman
who asks a man out is desperate, look-
ing for a good time or expecting the
man to pay for whatever the woman
wants to do on the date. There is no
doubt that the risks are on both sides.
and if we all take that into considera-
tion. perhaps asking people out won’t
be thought to be so terrible after all.
And I do appreciate your article. Mr.

it is like to meet new people.

Name Withheld Upon Request

Parked-In

The recent administrative decision to
close the William Penn parking lot at
Oakland and Bates Streets (giving
everyone one days notice) is another
glaring example of the lack of concern
this administration gives to its com-
muting suburban students. This univer-
sity promotes itself as a “commuter
school," yet fails to realize that there
is more to Pittsburgh than just Oakland
and Shadyside. The only means to
commute to Oakland. if you are not
conveniently located on a bus line. is
by car and with fewer parking options
available to students every year, it
becomes an almost impossible and
economically infeasible feat to drive to
Oakland on a daily basis.

The closing of this lot and the pro-
posed closing of the Syria Mosque lot
is evidence of this administration’s one-
sided concern for the "Big Business“

The Ritual Dissent/James M. Crary

aspect of the University of Pittsburgh.
It is common knowledge that in today's
world managing a university is similar
to running a large-scale corporation;
however, this administration has lost
sight of its main goal — to provide an
economical education to the public. A
university cannot function without
students to support it.

The university’s administration
needs to adopt a plan to alleviate the
problems students face when commut-
ing to campus including: the severe
lack of parking spaces especially for
students. parking fines. and fear of
walking long distances from the
available lots. particularly from the
stadium lot.

Coherence From The Heights/ Adam Eisenstat

A Word On The Herd

Like so many other species, man is a
herd animal. What makes this tendency
so pathetic in our species. though. is that
we are able to choose not to run with the
herd. yet so many do. out of insecurity.
loneliness. emptiness and a host of other
odious reasons. '

Herds of course serve a necessary func-
tion for the lost and uncreative of the
world. Be it an organization. a religion.
an ideology. a party or a scene. any com-
munal or supposedly communal body
allows one to sacriﬁce his individual iden-
tity for a group identity. No matter how
stringent. degrading or demanding this
newfound identity is. it is usually a huge
(if ﬂeeting) relief from the formidable
pressures of individuality for the
wayward. diseased soul.

The psychology of the herd has been
well—documented and analyzed, especial-
ly in Erie Hoffer‘s "The True Believer."
This brilliant little tome provides many
insights into what causes one to become
a herd creature. According to Hoffer.

self-hatred and the disturbing inability to
Carve out a satisfactory. individual niche
in a lonely and anonymous world are
prime reasons why people allow
themselves to be led to the trough of
received opinion and externally imposed
discipline.

Herds. as necessary and inevitable as
they seem to be. often pose a clear threat
to the lone wolf. the nameless stranger.
the iconoclastic original and all the other
archetypes of individuality. To interrupt
the bombast ifl may. one thing should
be made clear. Herds are not necessari-
ly the prototypical uniformed. goose-
stepping fanatics who have plagued
Europe and assorted armpits of the world
in this century. In America especially.
where a twisted history of lone justice and
mob rule makes for a very schizophrenic
landscape of bland uniformity and ex-
treme individualism. the herds are less
visible but no less repulsive and
threatening.

The herd and its corresponding men-

tality may not always threaten life and
limb. but they definitely threaten other
things that genuine individuals hold dear
like originality. ﬂexibility. diversity and
integrity. The small. well—entrenched
clique. for example. is a mini-
bureaucracy with bylaws and conventions
that have taken time to become rooted and
ossified. Any perceived threat to this
hardened shell of ordered social bonding
is usually met with swift suppression in
the form of ostracism and denial of ac-
cess and attention. Pettiness and artificial
exclusivity make up the glue that bonds
the jerry—built fortress of the herd.

The principal and overwhelming con-
cern ofthe herd is the unity or perceived
unity of the group. This is why the herd
mentality is so stagnant and reactionary.
All other possibilities such as the validi-
ty ofa new idea per se arejudged solely
by their relationship to the herd.
Ultimately the umbilical cord of the col-
lective womb will choke the unwanted
foreigner called possibility.

Queen Victoria so much represented
her time that it came to be called the Vic-
torian Era. For different reasons, the
same was true of Napoleon and. in
Russia. Stalin. Let me propose a man
who better than anyone else represents
our time: Paul Laxalt. R-Nev. We live
(if you can call it living) in the Laxalt Era.

Laxalt lends his name to our era
because he is the personification-of the
school of thought thatsaid the United
States really had a choice in the Philip-
pines. that it moved early and decisive-
ly. and that — here comes the really smart
part —— that all the lessons learned in
Manila can and ought to be applied to
Managua. The two have so much in com-
mon. Not only do both cities begin with
the letter “m” but most of the people liv-
ing in them are small (by American stan-

dards) and darker—skinned. It’s time to
move. Wagons. ho?

Historians will note that in the Laxalt
Era this is what passed for logic. Secre-
tary of State George Shultz. for instance.
was quick to apply the lessons of Manila
to the situation in Managua. He just
couldn't quite say what those lessons are.
The opposition in the Philippines. led by
the remarkable Corazon Aquino. was
popularly based and — as anyone with
a TV set could see — numerous. It was
supported by elements of the military.
especially reforrnist—minded ofﬁcers; and
by the all-important Catholic Church.

The situation in Nicaragua is far dif-
ferent. By the testimony of numerous ad-
ministration spokesmen, the so-called
Contra movement is going nowhere.

just looked at us in that icy way bored
and boring rich girls do. so we sought
new prey.

Within five minutes our genial host was
at our side. telling us in grave and regret-
ful tones. “Hey. you guys are gonna have
to leave. The landlord said it's getting too
crowded. so we have to move some peo-
ple out."

“Why don‘t you start with someone
else?“ I retorted to the worm. He
hemmed and hawed for a sec. and then
a massive. severely bulky bruiser walked
over and said in a drunken. brain—death
mumble. “You're outta here now.“ I
asked for a five-minute reprieve to gather
our less alienating companions. but the
lug wouldn‘t hear of it. ‘

Apparently someone put the jackboot
down on our antics. and in a herd, it on-
ly takes one to fasten the limp chain of
exclusion. In a masturbatory scene where
everyone’s stroking one another, no
penetration is allowed. But that's OK. I’ll
always throw rocks in calm ponds — I
like the ripples.

Without American aid — covert. overt.
lethal. non-lethal — it would wither in
no time. Even with a minimum of $100
million in U.S. aid, that still might hap-
pen. The Nicaraguan military by and
large still supports the Sandinista regime;
the church is critical but not in open
rebellion and the nation is not ending a
second decade of an authoritarian regime.
but just beginning its first.

The Laxalt Era would hardly be worth
the name if it did not also have a doc-
trine. It is this: Establish an alternative
evil to the regime you are opposing and
then ask people to choose. In Angola. the
doctrine compels the United States to al-
ly itself with Joseph Savimbi‘s UNITA
movement which itself is both identified
with, and beholden to. a racist regime in
South Africa. In Nicaragua. the ad-

essons Of Vietnam

ministration has worked the same magic.
It has cleverly asked Nicaraguans to
choose between an oppressive and in-
competent regime on the one hand and
the legendary Yankee interventionist on
the other. Some have chosen the San-
dinistas, some the Contras. Most. it
seems. have made no choice at all.

Even in the Laxalt Era. to think that
Nicaragua can follow where the Philip-
pines has gone takes some imagination.
At no time were Filipinos asked to choose
between an indigenous regime, as loath-
some as it might be. and a foreign power.

Mrs. Aquino. unlike the Contras, was not '

on the American dole. and her movement
was not created at CIA headquarters. The
United States clearly backed her electoral
insurgency. But it could be argued that
she is in office today despite —— not on

account of — the long-term policies of
the Reagan administration. which backed
Marcos almost to the last minute. Only
when reality tapped like a woodpecker on
the heads of senior administration of-
ficials was the policy reversed.

History does not necessarily subscribe
to Commentary. the neo-conservative
magazine and its fancy foreign policy
doctrines. What works in one country
may not work in another. There is a big
difference between assisting a revolution
in one country and fomenting a counter-
revolution in another.

Laxalt would be wise not to sit by the
phone. The lessons of Manila don‘t

necessarily apply to Managua. Maybe

those of Vietnam do.

U.S./Mid East policy a danger

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

In a Monday evening address. Dr.
Robert Hunter. Senior Fellow at
Georgetown University. warned that
the Reagan administrations failure to
pay sufficient attention to Middle-
Eastern developments poses a grave
danger to U.S. interests in the region.

“It is not Central America that we.
as a nation. should watch — it is the
Mid-East," Hunter said. “We at pres-
ent do not have a Mid—Eastem policy."

The former Carter Foreign Policy
Advisor said that he believes the ad-
ministration must now. more than ever,
take cognizance of Middle—Eastern
problems. Hunter explained that recent
events in the Middle East show that
political stability . in the region is
deteriorating.

“The chance of something going
wrong in the Mid—East is now ex-
tremely high,” Hunter said. “The
latest round of Arab—Israeli talks are in
tatters.  What's more, I am deeply
concerned about what has happened in

Hunter was referring to a recent
rebellion by Egyptian army personnel
that produced several days of near
chaos in the north African nation. Some
analysts interpreted the event as a
significant challenge to Mubarak‘s
authority and legitimacy as president
of Egypt. .

Hunter attributes America s ever-
diminishing concern for Middle—
Eastern affairs to the current oil glut.
A surplus of oil. he contended. has led
the United States to virtually ignore a

variety of problems. foremost of which _

is the “extraordinarily volatile“ Iran—
Iraq War.

Hunter said America's lack of in-
itiative in the Middle—East leaves the
Soviets with a greater opportunity to
expand its inﬂuence in the region.

“We see. in my judgement, more
opportunities for the USSR than ever
before." Hunter stated. “If the Soviets
came to dominate Iran, this would be
the most significant setback for the
United States since the Second World
War.  The consequences of such a
setback might be irreversible.” Hunter

noted. however, that he did not foresee

such a scenario in the near future.

interests than Iran. "Egypt is abso-
lutely essential to U.S. security in the
Mid—East.  If the US. God forbid.
ever became involved militarily in the
region.” Hunter said. “there are four
ways it could get forces there.  The
fastest route is via Egypt.  This is
one of the reasons why it is so impor-
tant to do something with the Arab-
lsraeli conflict.”

Dr. Alvin Rubenstein. the other
speaker for the evening. said that long-
term Soviet strategy in the Middle—East
is similar to the Soviets strategy in
other regions of the world.

“Gorbachev has little interest in the
region," the University of Penn-
sylvania Soviet specialist stated. “The
USSR doesn’t give a ruble about the
Middle East.  It is only important to
them because it’s important to
America.  Most likely  it seems
the USSR will simply continue to wait
for regional developments as they
come, exploiting them on an ad hoc
basis."

Both Hunter and Rubenstein said
they feel dealings with Middle—Eastern
nations can be extremely frustrating.
As Rubenstein put it, “Dealing with the

Organ Transplants:
Three families struggle
with the pain and wait

By Kathy Stahl
Staff Writer

It’s Saturday evening and Vince
Mollinari, in a fitting Italian fash-
ion, has prepared a buffet dinner
for his friends. Everybody is enjoy-
ing themselves, when, suddenly,
the phone rings. There is an abrupt
stillness. A moment of tension goes
by. Nobody wants to appear eager,
yet the anxiety is in their eyes. The
call is for Jay Anderson. He goes
to the phone, afraid to hope because
he’s been let down so often. In a
minute a look of disbelief crosses
his face. Could it be  a smile
breaks across his face. They have
found an organ donor for his wife
and the dinner now turns into a
celebration.

Organ transplantation. It is to-
day’s medical miracle. The leading
center for transplants is Pittsburgh’s
Presbyterian-University Hospital.
Dr. Thomas Starzl, a surgeon at
Presby, was the first person ever to
transplant a liver and to use the
immuno-suppressive (anti—rejec—
tion) drug cyclosporin in the United
States. Since the introduction of the
drug, transplant surgery has entered
a new era. But there are many
moral, ethical and financial prob-
lems that must be faced in dealing
with the new technology.

Jay Anderson’s wife, Sandra,
received her organ transplant in just

Family House, at 233 McKee Place, houses prospective
organ transplant patients and their families inexpensively.

the nick of time. Sandra first
became ill last October, and she had
her appendix removed as a result.
It was not until December. while at
Georgetown University Hospital,
that Sandra was diagnosed as hav-
ing Budd—Chiori Syndrome. This is
a condition that results when the
blood gets very thick and begins to
sludge. It then clots and the liver
must be replaced. The Andersons
came to Pittsburgh on Jan. 6 and
about 10 weeks later, on March 2.
Sandra received her transplant.

“My wife is about 5-6. and she
now weighs about 60 pounds. ” said
Anderson. “She was comatose
when I received the call. There’s
no way I can say enough about the
hospital. They did a remarkable job
in keeping Sandra alive. Dr. Starzl
is a legend. I bet his name is better
known here than the mayor‘s
name."

Sandra needed a type 0 blood
donor and an extremely small liver.
She received the liver from a young
teen—age girl from the West Coast.

Today Anderson looks like a new
man. For him, the months of
waiting are over. Sandra is in in-
tensive care, but that is a normal
procedure after a transplant
operation.

“It’s so much easier now that it’s
done, the waiting. It’s like a load
off my mind,” said Anderson.
“When you’re waiting, you can’t

help but wonder what it actually
takes to get an organ. You wonder
if you’re doing all you can. You
become desperate and you try
anything; you contact anyone that
you think can help you.

“But I think that when it actual-
ly comes down to the final decision
it amounts to the organs being
available,” said Anderson.

Not that this kept Anderson from
trying. He called everyone he
possibly thought could help him.
Last week he received a letter of en-
couragement from President
Reagan.

Jay’s friends are all very happy
for him, although Vince and
Marian Mollinari from New York
cannot help but be discouraged that
they have not heard anything yet.
Marian is also in need of a liver
transplant and she has been waiting
longer than any patient at Family
House. _

To the Mollinaris along with
Anderson and many others, Fami-
ly House has become their new
home. The house was established
under the University Health Center
of Pittsburgh and was funded by
five major sources: the Mellon-
Stuart Co., the Pittsburgh Pirates
Baseball Club, Frank Fuhrer, the
Richard King Mellon Foundation
and the American Cancer Society.
Since Nov. 1983, the house, with

Surgeons discuss conflict
of career and family life

By Kim Ingram
Staff Writer

While the other surgeons were mak-
ing the final closing stitches on the
kidney transplant patient, he found a
five—minute opportunity to slip from the
operating room and call home to see
if his family had found someone to fix
their broken furnace.

He is Dr. Hakala, chief of urology
and kidney transplant surgeon at the
University of Pittsburgh Presbyterian
Hospital. His story is like that of many
surgeons, the constant struggle to
balance the tensions of a career devoted
to saving lives and a life devoted to
raising a family.

But this struggle tends to get a little
hectic. especially when, as Dr. Hakala
said. the workday averages about 14
hours.

“I spend about lO.hours a day at
home and do whatever else needs to be
done,” said Hakala. “On weekends,
though, when I'm not on call, I have
time to spend with my children."

He explained that his schedule now
is much less time—consuming than when
he was a resident. “During my residen-
cy. I would work in the hospital for as
much as two and a half days without
sleep." He was also married at this
time.

In light of the fact that his strong
academic ambitions have made him
widely respected and admired in the
medical profession. Dr“. Bleyaert. an
anethesiologist, has some regrets. “If

I could go back in time, I would make
some serious adjustments in the time
I spent with my family," he said. “My
children never knew me.”

Bleyaert pointed out that during his
residency and fellowship. while his
children were growing up, all his time
was consumed by clinical work, teach-
ing, research and study. He often had
to spend weeks at a time away from
home. “I asked my children if they
wanted to be doctors when they grew
up." said Bleyaert. “and they said,
‘No, Dad. doctors are never home.’ ”

Bleyaert confronted the question of
why families of doctors sometimes fall
apart. “It takes a special woman to be
the wife of a doctor,” he said. “She
must raise the children practically on
her own and also love a husband who
is hardly ever there to help her.”

Although their free time is usually
restricted, most surgeons do not restrict
themselves to the extent that they alter
their activities simply to preserve their
hands. “Absolutely not,” said Gary
Patterson, an oral-maxillofacial and
trauma surgeon. “You can’t live your
life in a cocoon.” He explained that
this is not an important priority;
surgeons still do everything from
mountain climbing to auto work in their
spare time.

In addition to the amount of time that
the medical profession requires, there
are also responsibilities synonymous
with the job.

“In 15 years of surgery. I haven‘t
had anyone die on the table. But death
is something that you learn to deal with
in medical school. Everyone, some-

where along the line. has a patient who
dies," said Dr. Hakala. He has found
that it is important to listen to the pa-
tient while keeping a certain emotional
distance.

Bleyaert explained, when dealing
with death. a doctor must rationalize
the situation — but rationalization has
its limits. “Sometimes," he said,
“dealing with someone dying is harder
than the job itself."

Patterson agrees that informing a
family of a relative’s death is one of
the hardest aspects of the job.

“It’s best not to prolong the situa-
tion. but to be honest," said Patterson.
“Some families take it better than
others.”

Another responsibility that some
young doctors face is the amount of
money in loans that they must pay
back. ‘A first—year physician who did
not wish to benamed said that when
she startedpaying her loans back dur-
ing her residency, she owed $100,000
to the government. While her
secretaries came to work lavishly
dressed, she is now just breaking even,
buying only what she needs. She pays
$700 a month toward her loans, aside
from her other expenses, and doesn't
expect to be finished paying them un-
til the age of 40.

But in spite of the downfalls, most
doctors enjoy the work and the beneﬁts
of being a doctor. “It‘s an interesting
life.“ said Hakala. "It is a good feel-
ing to see a person‘s satisfaction when
you can help them. For me it's the best
job in the world."

is an original flavor of Dave and
Andy‘s. Pittsburgh‘s premier ice
cream establishment as named in
Carol T. Robbins and Herbert
Wolff‘s book, “The Very Best Ice
Cream and Where to Find It.”
(Warner Books, $2.95). The
authors list Dave and Andy‘s
Homemade Ice Cream, 207 At-
wood Street, Oakland, as one of the
two best places in Western Penn-
sylvania to buy ice cream. The
other place is the Uno Poco Di
Roma Restaurant, located on South
Park Road in Bethel Park.

Ice—cream making has been a
hobby of owners Dave Tuttle and
Andy Hardie for a number of years.
Tuttle’s interest was sparked by his
grandfather, who was always mak-
ing ice cream in an old-fashioned
hand-cranked machine later con-
verted to a power—operated device
using old Frigidaire parts. Tuttle
also attended Penn State‘, where he
completed a short course in ice-
cream making under the direction
of ice cream mogul Professor Philip
Keeney.

Dr. Keeney has published
scholarly works, been consulted on
three continents and testified before
Congressional sub-committees on
the subject of ice cream. His course
has been a valuable investment for
numerous ice—cream entrepreneurs
and dairy executives, and the
reputation of Penn State’s national-
ly acclaimed Creamery has also

earned it a listing in Robbins and
Wolff‘s publication.

Andy Hardie. on the other hand,
attended Hobart College in New
York. and became interested in ice-
cream making while visiting the
New England states. It was there
that he realized quality homemade
ice cream was an easy commodity
to sell. _

In order to earn a place in “The
Very Best Ice Cream and Where to
Find It." Dave and Andy’s had to
fill out a questionnaire explaining
their ice-cream making techniques
and telling the percentage of but-
terfat and overrun '(air) that their
products contain. They were also
invited to send samples of their ice
cream to the authors. Of the 281
ice—cream makers listed in the
book, 13 are in Pennsylvania, with
all but two located in the eastern
part of the state. As an extra-special
treat, the ice-cream guide, organ-
ized in alphabetical order by state,
offers the bearer over 200 scoops
of free ice cream when the book is
presented to the participatin
establishments. —

Dave and Andy, both 25, opened
the Oakland store two years ago.
They take turns making their 14
percent butterfat ice cream in five-
gallon batches in a motorized White
Mountain freezer near the front of
the store. As far as selection goes,
customers may choose from sugar,
cake or homemade waffle cones
(plain or chocolate dipped), and
must decide which of the sixteen
available “add-ins” — ranging
from M&M’s to almonds to
crushed Oreo cookies —— would best
complement their favorite scoop.
Dave and Andy’s carries" 10 to 12"‘
freshly-made flavors a day, in-
cluding Butter Brickle, Chocolate

seller, Cookies & Cream.

JFK controversy revived in film

By Shannon Smuts
Staff Writer

Who really shot John Fitgerald Ken-
nedy? This week, two events will ex-
plore possibilities beyond the official
indictment of Lee Harvey Oswald, or
the alleged faults in the government’s
ofﬁcial version of the assassination, the
Warren Commission Report.

“Executive Report,” a movie star-
ring Burt Lancaster, Will Geer and
Robert Ryan, will be shown on Satur-
day, March 15 at 7 and 9 p.m. in the
David Lawrence Auditorium, and
again on Monday, March 17 at 9 p.m.

“Executive Action” dramatizes a
conspiracy leading up to the assassina-
tion of John F. Kennedy. Although the
characters‘ names are fictitous,
everything else is based on fact. The
ﬁlm was released nationally in the sum-
mer of 1977, but was pulled from the
theaters a few weeks later because of
its controversial accusations against
certain well-known individuals.

Prior to the movie, Cyril Wecht.

A weekly listing of events in Pittsburgh

Kennedy assassination, discussed his
theories concerning the assassination
yesterday. Wecht was the first non-
governmental pathologist to examine
the medical evidence of the case at the
National Archives. He strongly
disbelieves the single-bullet theory and
feels that three, possibly four shots,
were fired.

The level of college student interest
in response to Kennedy's assassination,
according to Wecht, is undeservedly
low right now.

“JFK doesn’t mean much to a lot of
college students,“ said Wecht.
“They’re away from their parents and
not as exposed as students were 10 and
15 years ago.”

Numerous talk shows, books and ar-
ticles about the assassination circulated
the country in the years following Nov.
22. 1963, the date of Kennedy’s
assassination. But in the past years, few
official statements have been issued
about the assassination. Despite the
lack of recent coverage, Wecht feels
that the potential for public interest in
what really happened still exists. In the

past 10 years, Wecht has been lectur-

an increase in student interest.

“They’re not jaded; they're hearing
this for the first time.“ said Wecht.
“The dreams and the aspirations, the
promise, the need for civil rights, ” said
Wecht. “It was like a modern-day
Camelot."

Wecht thinks that it is a shame that
students today will probably only hear
about the controversy over J FK‘s

something that we should all be con-

president, a “coup d'etat. ‘ ’ Wecht said
that the assassination was an overthrow
of the U.S. government. JFK was in
the prime of his personal and political
life. And according to Wecht. having
unquestionably been re-elected, his
philosophies would have continued to
spread. “Somebody wanted him elim-

its 29 rooms, has been a place of
comfort to the people waiting for
transplants. Waiting is one of the
hardest parts.

-“I’m very happy for Jay,” said
Marian, “but I wish that I also
would get a call. Every time the
phone rings or the beeper (which
the patients have in case they are
not near a phone) goes off, I hold
my breath hoping. But now I’m
beginning to be afraid to hope. I can
feel my body deteriorating and I
want the liver before I become too
weak to help myself.”

As Marian sits in the living room
at Family House her frailty is ap-
parent. “Any physical activity that
Marian does is limited because she

gets tired so very fast,” said Vince.

Vince does a lot of the talking
when explaining Marian’s condi-
tion. He gives the impression of be—
ing a typical Italian man, very
outgoing and good-natured. Yet he
also appears to be more frustrated
than his wife; and there’s nothing
he can do but wait.

“Marian was first diagnosed a
few years ago as having hepatitis,”
said Vince. “Then it was found out
she had PBC. which involves a
clogging of the valve ducts to the
liver. Most people have it for eight
or 10 years and they don’t even
know it.”

The disease has the same symp-
toms as hepatitis which include
itchiness, tiredness and, finally,
esophageal bleeding.

“I don’t know what it’s like to
sleep anymore,” said Marian.
“For the past three years I’ve had
this itch. It’s in your blood, in your
veins.”

Marian was sent in for an ex-

can’t believe that all this is happen-
ing. When it’s all over I want to go
to Disney World. It’s such a fan-
tasy place. I want to get away and
forget everything.”

But for right now, Marian can
only wait and pray.

Another family who knows what
waiting is all about is the family of
Evelyn and Rich Lane from Con-
nellsville, a small Pennsylvania
town about one hour away from
Presbyterian—University Hospital.
Rich has been waiting about a year
and’ a half now for a heart
transplant. .

In June 1984, Rich had a massive
heart attack, his second one in 13
years. Last fall, he was admitted to
the hospital.

“They told us then that within
one day to three months Rich would
have a transplant done." said
Evelyn. “They released him from
Presby and we sat by the phone for

' 24 hours at a time.”

In Jan. 1985 Rich had congestive

volunteers are so nice, and Laurie,
the director who lives at the house,
is great.”

Vince also feels strongly about
the house. “People come here and
when they leave they feel like
they’re leav_ing a family.”

Marian says that Family House
has been positive for her kids.
“One of my sons came to see me
and he met one of the ladies who
was leaving after having had a suc-
cessful transplant. My son had a
look of hope on his face after he
met her."

At Family House, everyone tries
to understand what the person is go-
ing through. That’s why it is kept
so cozy and pleasant.

“On my first day here I was sick
on the plane,” said Marian. “I was
so afraid. I walked in here and I
saw this beautiful Christmas tree.
The place was so much like a
home.”

Family House is also relatively
cheap for the families. According

for the surgery. Now. the way it
stands, many patients are forced to
take the “bake-sale” route to get
money:

In many instances, payment is
often decided on a case-by-case
basis. It may depend on who you
know and the state you live in.

The current lack of consistency
for organ transplants exerts
pressure on the hospital as well as
on the patient. Hospitals must cover
financial expenditures and it is
believed by many that if they did
not insist on payment, the program
would become such an economic
burden that it would have to be
eliminated. Thus, hospitals some-

times are forced to refuse a can— t

didate unless his insurance or the
state or local government will pay
for the transplant.

Another major concern with the
transplant program is who should
receive transplants first. In the May
12, 1985 issue of the Pittsburgh
Press, it was stated that since 1984,

“It used to make me nervous to
think of donating my organs,” said
Evelyn Lane. “Now, after being
forced into the situation that I'm in,
I’ve definitely changed my mind.
When you’rc dead, that’s it. It’s a
ﬁnality; so why not help someone
else?”

Marian Mollinari said that she
prays for the donors, the doctors
and herself. “It’s hard to realize
that you’re going to live because
someone else is going to die,”
Marian said. “I think that the na-

JFK-'-

continued from page 9

Meeting of the American Academy of
Forensic Sciences. After researching
the subject and presenting his paper, his
interest grew into a project.

Five years after the day of the
assassination, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, who gave all of the evidence
in the case to the National Archives as
a “gift,” made a stipulation that a
recognized expert in the ﬁeld of
pathology could examine the X-rays,
photographs, autopsy slides and other
medical evidence at the National Ar-
chives. Wecht applied and was
accepted.

In the August of 1972, after spending
a year in correspondence with the Na-
tional Archives and with the help of
The New York Times, Wecht ﬁnally
went in to examine the evidence. After
he discovered that JFK’s brain was
missing from the archives, a front-page
story appeared in The New York Times.
Upon further examination of the
evidence and the Warren Commission
Report, Wecht expressed his opposi-
tion to the report and the claim that only
one shot was fired. He appeared on
numerous talk shows and news pro-
grams, and spoke on dozens of radio
shows. In 1974. he testified before the
Rockefeller Commission, which was

established to review the assassination.

Wecht, in addition to many other
critics, has his own suspicions about the
justification of a political need to
eliminate Kennedy. “JFK had
charisma, political magic, everyone
was turned on by him," said Wecht.
Kennedy was also in a position to make
changes — he was the president, a
multi—millionaire and had a strong
following among the people. And. he
had a progressive attitude toward big

business, minorities and civil rights. If
you were in opposition to these
changes, according to Wecht, JFK
might “scare the life out of you."

“Your vision of America, your
country, might be changed by the work
of one man.” said Wecht.

On the whole. Wecht would like to
see more intellectual activity among
American college students regarding
subjects of national concern. In other

nations, Wecht noted, the “greatest
amount of activism is on college cam-

puses.” He cited examples such as
Cambridge, Oxford and universities in
Mexico City.

Wecht's lecture and the screening of
“Executive Action” are being spon-
sored by the Black American Law
Students Association. the National
Lawyer’s Guild of the University of
Pittsburgh School of Law, the Student

Jerome Lane will need to keep grabbing the offensive rebound forhe
Panthers to succeed in the National Invitational Tournament.

Chaz Pailla/The Pitt News

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

Many people thought that the Roy
Chipman era at Pitt had ended with the
one-point loss to Georgetown last
Thursday. but the second season begins
tonight for the Pitt basketball team. The
Panthers get back into action when they
face Southwest Missouri State at Ham-
monds Student Center in Springfield.
Mo. Tipoff is at 8:35 p.m. (EST).

“It has to end sometime.“ Chipman
said after the loss to Georgetown.
"Either we go all the way, or my final
game is a loss."

Chipman was referring to the NCAA
Tournament when he spoke of going
“all the way." but the possibility was
revived when Pitt Athletic Director Dr.
Ed Bozik accepted a bid to participate
in the National Invitational Tournament
on Sunday night. The Panthers were
later paired with Southwest Missouri
State and told they would be on the
road for the first-round game. A win
over Southwest Missouri State would
set the Panthers up to host an NIT sec-
ond—round or quarterfinal-round game,
according to Pitt basketball publicist
Kimball Smith.

The Panthers must, of course, face
the task at hand before thinking of com-
ing home to host a second game.
Southwest Missouri State. nicknamed
the “Bears," is 22-7. The Bears
finished behind NCAA participant
Cleveland State in the Association of
Mid-Continent Universities Con-
ference. They are a small. quick team

that will challenge Pitt defensively.

The Bears are led by 6-2 junior
Winston Garland. who averages 16.5
ppg. Senior Phil Schlegel. the Bears‘
tallest starter at 6-6. adds to the attack
with 13.3 ppg. Junior Greg Bell. stand-
ing only 6-5. is Southwest Missouri
State‘s leading rebounder. averaging 6
rpg while chipping in with 12.8 ppg.
Rounding out the starting lineup for the
Bears is 6-4 senior forward Chris Ward
(9.4 ppg. 5.6 rpg) and 5-10junior point
guard Basil Robinson (6.4 ppg, 153
assists).

Pitt will deﬁnitely have an advantage
underneath. with 6-10 forward Charles
Smith being joined by 6-9 Keith Arm-
strong. 6-6 Jerome Lane and 6-5
Demetreus Gore. Southwest Missouri
State resembles one of the teams Pitt
would have on its schedule in
November or December in terms of
height. Do not be deceived. however.
The Bears, on the average, outrebound-
ed their opponents 30.2 to 29.6 this
year.

So the stage is set for Pitt's last-ditch
effort to make Chipman’s exit a
gracious one. Currently 15-13, the
Panthers can end up with a 20-win
season if they go all the way.

NIT Notes: The game will not be
televised but will be broadcast by
1250/WTAE Radio. Bill I-Iillgrove and
Dick Groat will call the game  Ac-
cording to Southwest Missouri State

antoro, Nelli ready for NCAS

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

The University of Iowa. the mecca
of collegiate wrestling. will be this
year’s host for the 1986 NCAA Divi-
sion I Wrestling Championships. The
hosting Hawkeyes will be gunning for
their seventh straight team champion-
ship in the meet thaﬁjbegins tomorrow
and lasts through Saturday evening.

The Pitt wrestling team will not be 1

there in hopes of upsetting former
Olympic hero Dan Gable’s team.
Nonetheless. the Panthers will be well-
represented by senior Kyle Nellis and
freshman Pat Santoro by virtue of their
runne-r-up finishes at last weekend‘s
EWL championships. C

Both Panthers must rebound from
defeats in the finals a week ago.
Despite their setbacks. head coach
Rande Stottlemyer has high hopes for
their success at Nationals.

“Both have wrestled really well in
practice this past week." Stottlemyer
said. “They‘re both beginning to peak
and get stronger. I feel good where
they're at right now. and I‘m sure they
do too.”

The long road to Iowa has been one
and the same for both wrestlers, but
two very different guys have traveled
that road. For Nellis it‘s his last and
only chance to reach the final destina-
tion ofa collegiate wrestler‘s dream —

ing on an up note." said Nellis. “1’ve
obviously never been here before. so
I‘m not even worried or uptight.
“I'm wrestling the best I can com-
ing into the tournament. Placing in the
top eight is a realistic goal." continued
Nellis. “Everyone here has the same

thought — to win it. [just want to go‘

as high as I can." Nellis goes to the
Midwest carrying a solid 24-7 record.

On the other hand. there stands a
young and very exciting freshman.
Santoro has blazed through his first
year thus far. recording an impressive
28-6 mark. Tomorrow could be the
start of something big for this unassum-
ing youngster.

"I tell myself each person there is
just a person." said a rather low-key
Santoro. "Their school name and
record doesn‘t mean anything.

“I definitely want to be an All-
America. I‘m going to go for the title
and not just to place. You can’t go in
just shooting to place or else you defeat
the purpose of even being there."

Both Panthers have labored through
an entire season to get where they are
now: in Iowa City competing with the
nation's finest. “They‘ve worked the
hardest all year." said Stottlemyer.
“It’s fitting that they‘re the two guys
competing at Nationals."

They’ve arrived facing different
situations. but Nellis and Santoro will
compete-in the same light. striving to

One thing at Pitt remains constant: Bobby Lewis

By Stefanie Frelick
Staff Writer

The year was 1954. Having just been
discharged from the Marine Corps,
Bobby Lewis took an assistant coaching
position at Pitt under his former col-
lege basketball coach, Ralph “Sarge”
Mitterling. On the first day of sched-
uled practice in 1955, Mitterling suf-
fered a stroke and died some 10 months
later. At the age of 24, Lewis was made
head coach. Little did anyone know
that he would go on for more than 30
years to become the winningest coach
in Pitt’s history. With a career record
of 392-281 spanning over three
decades, Lewis surpassed Hall of Fame
basketball coach Doc Carlson last
season.

When he first took over, Lewis
realized the value of his Marine Corps
experience in that it eased the transi-
tion of being in charge.

“Since I'd come out of the Marines
as a company commander, I was used
to handling people so the leadership
didn’t bother me,” said Lewis. “The
unique thing was the age difference.
Some of my players were older than me
because they’d just gotten out of the
service."

From the outset, Lewis has tried to
follow what his predecessor had done.
After all, Mitterling was the biggest in-
ﬂuence on his coaching career, and one
of the most important things Lewis
thinks he learned from “Sarge” was
a proper perspective of the game.

“Sarge would always say: ‘Play hard
and when the games over, it‘s over.
It’s not a life and death situation,’ ”
said Lewis.

Carrying on this lighter, but no less
serious attitude, Lewis has provided his
players with the type of surrounding
that brings out the most in each of
them. According to Pitt’s All-Big East
centerfielder Matt Stennett, “Coach

Lewis keeps the atmosphere loose. He
doesn‘t put lots of pressure on you.
which helps the team play its best."

Lewis never overlooks such aspects
and always has time for his players. He
refers to them as the most important
part of his job. even with his other
duties at the university.

He is the programming and schedule
coordinator for all men's varsity sports.
physical education teacher and overseer
of the Pitt Varsity Letter’ Club.

Loyal to the idea that academics are
far more important than any game or
practice session. Lewis is known for

(his emphasis on attaining a college

degree.

“Coach always tells us, school first,
baseball second and all other activities
come after," noted Keith Shuster. the
team's No. 1 pitcher.

Lewis points out that since only a few
college baseball players end up in the
major leagues, he believes the degree
becomes essential. This philosophy is
reflected in the recruiting process as
well.

“Our approach to recruiting is not
baseball — its education," said Lewis.
“If a kid wants a degree and to par-
ticipate in baseball, it can work here
[at Pitt]. If not, he should just sign [a
pro contract] after high school.”

Another example that demonstrates
what education means to him is Lewis’
fondest memory as a coach. It is his
1968 team which included Doc
Medich, who went on to have a suc-
cessful pro career with the Yankees and
Pirates. That year, the team went all
the way to the National Collegiate
Baseball Tournament in California. But
Lewis takes great pride in something
else. “Aside from being a good team,
they had an overall Q.P.A. of 3.25 that
season.”

His attitude towardacademics re-
mains consistent today. as does his
outlook on baseball itself. Lewis

Will Pitt face Timbuktu State next?

Wake up Pitt basketball fans.
Tonight. the Panthers will ﬁnally show
the potential so many expected from
them this year. Pitt. for one evening,
will impress all of its fans. Pitt will not
play like a team that struggled to a
15-13 record. Tonight. they will put on
a show. They will make the steals. pull
down the key rebounds and hit the
jump shots. They will win big.

Tonight. Pitt will play Southwest
Missouri State. Yes. that‘s right. Pitt
will look like worldbeaters against
Southwest Missouri State. I‘ve never
heard of them before. Oh well. I guess
I must have been watching another
game on another channel when the ol’
Bears were on the tube.

Tonight wasldestined to be a big
night in Pitt basketball history. The
team was supposed to be preparing for
the NCAA Tournament, and this was
to be the year that the Panthers could
possibly win a few games in the
prestigious tourney.

But when it came time to send out
the NCAA invitations, Pitt was no
where to be found on the 64-team list.
In fact, it was discovered that Pitt
wasn’t even praying for a bid last Sun-
day. Everyone knew there was no
hope. Everyone knew Pitt didn’t
deserve to be competing with the na-

writers.

tion‘s top 64 teams. So what‘s this talk
about a big win tonight‘?

You say the Panthers are in the NIT
tournament. Oh well. I guess there‘s
not that much difference between the
NIT and NCAAs. They‘re both post-

Randy Miller

season toumaments. And I was brought
up to believe that you‘re accomplishing
something when you’re still playing
after your schedule indicates the season
should be over.

But the more I think about it, the
more I get sick. The NIT is a loser
tournament. It’s made up of 32 “never
were” or “supposed to have been”
teams. Half of the teams come from
here to Timbuktu and have won only
a few basketball games. The other
teams are UCLA’s and Ohio State’s —
the teams from respectable conferences
that didn’t quite live up to expectations.
Pitt fits into the latter category
perfectly.

So Pitt’s playing Southwest Missouri
State. And yes, Pitt fans, don‘t hold
your breath. Pitt will not lose to a team
that no one has heard of. The Panthers
thrive on beating such teams.
Remember back in November when

Pitt whipped the likes of Lafayette.
IUP. St. Francis and Westminster.
Well. Southwest Missouri State is a
slightly advanced version of those
teams.

The question I am asking myself is
this: If Pitt wins easily tonight and goes
on to win the entire tournament. will
that salvage a bad season‘? Pitt would
end the season with 19 wins. two more
than last season. It would look im-
pressive when one would glance at
Pitt’s season records years down the
road.

I say a NIT championship will not

salvage the season. Even if Pitt strolls .-

into the Big Apple and beats UCLA in
front of a sellout crowd at Madison
Square Garden it will not_salvage the
year.

I will remember this year as the year
Pitt won only six Big East Conference
games. I will remember the 1985-86
season as the one that Seton Hall
whipped Pitt at the field house. I will
remember this as the year that the Pan-
thers lost at Connecticut, Providence
and Boston College.

So, Pitt basketball fans, when you
start to think that the Panthers may
bring home another title to the City of
Champions. go back to sleep — the
season is over.

As I see it

It was a night of surprises. After two
upsets and two new champions in the
other two feature attractions. you had
to wonder. will John “The Beast
Mugabi make it three‘? Or will "Mar-
velous" Marvin Hagler retain the un-
disputed middleweight championship
of the world‘?

Round 1: Hagler surprises everyone
by coming out in the orthodox stance.
There is little action as both men ap-
pear to be measuring each other.
Mugabi is unaffected by the pressure.
He is conﬁdent. He lands a few stiff
shots that gain Hagler's respect. But
when he raises his hands at the end of
the round as a sign of impending vic-
tory, Hagler shoots back one of his
famous scowls. The psyche job is on.

Round 2: Mugabi is chasing Hagler,
landing some left hooks and overhand
rights. The punches are landing. but
not flush. Hagler comes back midway
through the round, landing a series of
right—left combinations. He is back in
the southpaw stance. Mugabi lands a
few glancing hooks. Mugabi is loading
up on almost every punch, but they are
not landing ﬂush.

Round 3: Hagler is ﬁghting better
defensively and countering as Mugabi
misses. He keeps Mugabi away with
that patented right jab. The bell sounds
and as before, there is a lot of psyching
going on after the round ends.

Round 4: One minute into the round,
they trade jarring right hands. Hagler

. catches Mugabi with another right jab-

straight left combination. Hagler is on
the attack. He lands a variety of stiff
punches, but Mugabi keeps coming.
Mugabi catches Hagler on the way in
with a booming right uppercut that
snaps the champions head. Hagler is
shaken but manages to slip most of

.» Mugabi’s onslaught until Mugabi I

catches Hagler with a right hook to the
chin ‘at the bell. There are a lot of good

punches being landed by both men.

Someone’s got to go.

How Hagler tamed “the Beast’

Round 5: They charge each other and
go at it in ring center at a furious pace.
The pace slows as neither man lands
a substantial punch. Hagler‘s jab has
probably won him the round. Mugabi
manages a left hook-straight right com-
bination. but not much else.

Round 6: The first minute shows
both men measuring each other. A big
left by Hagler stuns Mugabi. They
trade punches in ring center at an
unbelievable pace. Hagler is getting the
best of it. He lands with every kind of
punch imaginable. Mugabi’s hands are
at his sides. This is Hagler's 12th title
defense, and he has never dished out
this kind of punishment to any of his
previous contenders, but Mugabi
refuses to go down. He even comes
back with authority at times. The snap
is still in Mugabi’s punches. What a
ﬁght! The question has been answered.
Mugabi can take a punch. (What an
understatement!) The last two minutes
of the round are reminiscent of the
Hagler-Hearns first round.

Round 7: Both men are winded from

the ﬁerce action. Boxing is thrown out

the window as the two men brawl,
pushing each other around the ring.
The crowd is loving’ it. The referee
breaks them apart. The two men cast
intimidating looks. It doesn’t work for
either man. Mugabi is showing no
respect for Hagler, who is returning the
favor.

Round 8: Thertwo men carefully
stalk each other. They appear to be
loading up for the big punch. Halfway
through the round, Mugabi snaps
Hagler’s head with a right—left com-
bination. But Hagler absorbed most of
the blow by backing away. He is not
hurt, but his right eye is swelling fast.
As Mugabi comes in, Hagler begins
pumping the jab again. Mugabi is chas-
ing, but he seems tired. Hagler is
strong.

Round 9: Hagler opens the round
with a typical Hagler offensive. He is

combining right jabs. straight lefts and I

right hooks. Hagler is ready to assume

control of the fight when Mugabi
comes back and fights on guts alone.
He begins to back Hagler up with his
own combinations of various punches.
Hagler’s right eye is almost swollen
shut. It is a tough round to score.
Hagler won the first half. Mugabi the
second.

Round 10: Hagler is getting wild.
Mugabi counters well. This is it!
Mugabi has his second wind and is go-
ing for the knockout! He is throwing
bombs at Hagler. He still has the kind
of power that could end the ﬁght. even
against the rock-jawed champion.
Mugabi’s big left hook comes close
time and time again. However, he
misses with everything. Hagler retains
his composure and begins working the
jab again. The round ends. Mugabi is
tired and frustrated. Psychologically.
he is a beaten man. '

Round 11: Looking at Mugabi in his
corner between rounds. it is obvious
that he has lost all of his confidence.
His prize weapon. the left hook, has
never landed when he’s “loaded it up. ”
This is the key. He has no idea what
to do. The only way that he’s landed
the left hook was either when he
sacrificed power for speed or when he
landed it glancingly. It has yet to land
flush. .Hagler senses this and attacks.
He hits Mugabi with a barrage of short
punches and the confused Mugabi wilts
under the compilation of punishment
absorbed throughout the ﬁght and falls.
He does not get up.

At 1:29 of Round 1 1. Hagler knocks
out Mugabi and retains the title.

Mugabi has surprised a lot of peo-
ple with his incredible ability to take
a punch. He was still “in the ﬁght" up
until the end of the 10th round. As Gil
Clancy said, “He'll be back.”

Mugabi was not psychologically
ready for a “war" like this.

doesn’t find that much has changed
about players since he ﬁrst began
coaching. One thing that he feels re-
mained constant is the desire young
men have to play.

“It’s stayed the same —— the kids love
the game just as much today. I mean,
they walk up_ that hill at 6:30 am. in
the winter, they ‘must love it,” said
Lewis. “And with baseball, even if the
team doesn’t do well in a game, if you
hit a homerun you can still feel good.
The nice thing is that the player can

always find some satisfaction,” he

added.

Lewis said he felt some satisfaction
after last season. It was the team’s first
year in the Big East Conference, and

By Roy Bigler
Staff Writer

This past weekend the men’s track
team attended the IC4A‘s invitational
track meet in Princeton, N.J . The team
did not come away with all of its peo-
ple ﬁnishing as they expected, but they
were not wholly disappointed.

For the first time in several years Pitt
has an IC4A champion. Both Lee
McRae and the two mile relay team of
Joe Daniels. Tim Manes, Dave Moore
and Bob Weiner were ﬁrst place
ﬁnishers. McRae came through in 6.13
seconds which set a new meet record
for the 55—meter dash.

Pitt’s other hopefuls were the com-
petitors in the 55—meter hurdles, but
they ran into some bad luck. In the
semi—ﬁnals Calvin Holmes false—staI’ted
and Eric Cannon stumbled going over
a hurdle which kept both of them from
advancing to the ﬁnals, where they
would have had a chance of finishing
well.

“I was generally pleased with the
way things went,” commented coach

he was quite pleased with the players‘
performance. This year he is just as op-
timistic, and if it’s anything like last
season, it should be a success.

Also, this season, Lewis is looking
at another milestone ~—- his 400th vic-
tory, and probably will get it.

A man who has coached through ﬁve
chancellors, four athletic directors, six
football coaches and taught hundreds
of students, Bobby Lewis is Pitt
baseball. But when asked how he

would like to be remembered, he
modestly replied, “As a good person.
I ’m an average coach, but I want to be
remembered as a good person.”
Average? Not many average college
coaches are kept, let alone the win-
ningest in their school’s history.

 

John Vasvary after reflecting on his
team’s performance. They did improve
in a vastly competitive field. The 21
points they gained from the ﬁnishes
gave them a tenth place ﬁnish, up from
last year‘s l2th—place finish. "Just an
example of how tough the competition
is  said Vasvary, "21 points would
have gotten us ﬁfth—place last year."
While the men were in Princeton, the
women were competing at Yale Uni-
versity. They had hoped to do well, and
were not disappointed in the least. They
did not come away with an Eastern
Region championship, but were very
happy with the way things turned out.
Renee Henderson was fourth in both
the 55—meter dash and the 200—meter
dash. Sue Torray also did well by
finishing fifth in the 500-meter dash.
“I was pretty pleased with the way
things turned out,” said the women’s
head coach Steve Lewis. The women
had been preparing for this meet all
season long and, for those that qualiﬁed
to go, it was the highlight of the season,
one which saw a much maligned team
from Pitt rise through the ranks to a
place it deserves among the best. Their

Baseball team opens season in Florida

All-Big Eascneler Matt Stentt."

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

Baseball on a hardwood basketball
court? That’s not exactly what Abner
Doubleday had in mind when baseball
was invented. His idea of ideal baseball
would include green grass, blue skies
and constant sunshine.

Unfortunately, when you play ball in
a northern city like Pittsburgh, you
have to take the game indoors in the
winter. Instead of hearing birds chirp-
ing and enjoying the sun’s light, the Pitt
baseball team hears basketballs drib-
bling and has to stare into the glaring
lights of Fitzgerald Field House to
catch a fly ball. It is baseball — Pitts-
burgh style.

But, while the going might be tough ‘

right now for the Panthers, it is going
to get a lot easier in the coming days.
The Panthers take their act on the road
to a place where baseball was meant to
be played almost year round: Florida.
Pitt will travel to Panama City to take
on Brooklyn College on Saturday, and
Tennessee and Bradley University on
Sunday.

After that, it is on to Tallahassee

where they will play the No. 1—ranked
Florida State Seminoles in four games.

The competition will be tough for the
Panthers, especially since a lot of last
year’s starters are not back this season.

But the young and enthusiastic Panthers
are ready to take on the tough job ahead
of them.

“We lost a lot of real good hitters,"
said head coach Bobby Lewis. “It will
not be easy to fill some of the positions,
but I do think we have the personnel
who can do the job. There will be a real
battle at some spots. The competition
is keen. There is a lot of equal talent,
it is just a matter of who is going to be
hot. We have an enthusiastic group. I
want to get them out on the ﬁeld to see
what they look like.”

Returning from last year‘s team will
be starters Dave Westwood at first.
Brian Lohman in left and Matt Sten-
nett in center. On the mound, the Pan-

thers will be counting on the talents of I

seniors Frank Craska and Mike Shan-
non, junior Keith -Shuster and
sophomore Rich Gavran. The four.
along with the rest of the staff, are ex-
pected to provide the Panthers with
some strong pitching.

While this is only his first year as a
starter, the Panthers will get a strong
boost from senior Don Fausnaught at
second base. Fausnaught, the team cap-
tain, hit .353 as a reserve last season.
With his keen defensive abilities and
strong hitting, Fausnaught will help
Lewis strengthen his 1986 line—up.

“I’m expecting a good year out of

Donnie,” Lewis said. “Theipotential
is there. He has the mechanics and
speed to do the job at second.”

"team-oriented. We want to be winners".'“

One position that is a concern to
Lewis is catcher. Last year’s starter,
Chris Jelic, signed as the second-round
draft choice of the Kansas City Royals,
leaving a big void at a key position.

“How do you replace a No. 2 draft
choice?” Lewis said. “It is a crucial
position because you need a leader.
Someone has to take control."

Lewis’ worries may be solved easier
than he thought was possible.
Sophomore John Brush and freshman
Jeff Hackett are two of the talented
prospects Lewis has behind the plate.

. “John is a good defensive player and

a really good hitter,” Lewis com-'

mented. “Jeff is also a good hitter and
is tough behind the plate.”‘

Other key performers for the Pan-

thers will be sophomores Gregg
Lamanti at shortstop, Rich Lowman on
the mound, Alex Kartsonas backing up
at ﬁrst and providing offensive strength
as the designated hitter and junior Jim
Leitera in the outﬁeld. They will com-
bine with a strong and talented group
of newcomers that includes pitchers
Michael Bonidie, John Carroll, David
Kleindl, FrankiMerigliano and Eric
Sandberg. In the infield, the young
talent includes Mike Claus, Eric
Leonheart, Alan Poppa and Rich
Scaich, while in the outfield freshmen,
Jay Duderstadt, Neil Roach and Jon
Sandri will team up with football
players Bill Osborn and Chuckie
Scales.

Last season was the first year of Big
East action for the Panthers. Their
overall record was 16-18 with a con-
ference record of 6-12. Stennett was
second in the conference in hitting and
was named All-Big East.

“It is great being in the conference,”
Lewis said. “It is exciting for me and
the team. There are a lot of good teams,
and it is a very competitive con-

ference.” .

Fausnaught knows how tough the
competition will be, but he thinks this
year’s team can handle the challenge.

“Everybody wants to win,”
Fausnaught said. “The guys are all

Hopefully, we will be able to blow peo-
ple away instead of struggling with
them. But, while winning, we want to
have fun.”

Tennis team takes lumps early in D.C.

By Gregg Ficery
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s tennis team returned
from their trip to Washington, D.C.
this past weekend with a 1-2 mark to
start their 1986 season. Although the
record does not necessarily reflect it,
the Panthers revealed generally strong
play for so early in the season, especial-
ly in singles, and gained valuable match
experience.

The Panthers opened play on Friday
night in a match with Howard Univer-
sity at the Hanes Point Indoor Complex
after being forced to cancel their
previously scheduled afternoon match
with George Washington University
due to inclement weather. The squad
clinched their first victory of the season

before doubles play even began, tak-
ing a 5-1 advantage after singles and
cruising to a 7-2 ﬁnal margin. The
match was highlighted by a matchup of
No. 1 players Jeff Dadowski of the
Panthers and Haywood Willis of
Howard. Willis, who attended Pitt for

two years, gwas worn down _b_y'

University. Again, strong singles play
by Dadowski as well as freshman Neil
Meyerowich (No. 2) and first-year
starter Jeff Lafuria (No. 6) held the
squad together, forcing a 3-3 deadlock
going into doubles play. The Panthers
had their best chance at seizing an ad-
vantage at the No.__4 spot, but Pitt’s

Dadowski, ﬁnally succumbing in‘ an
8-6 decision. Juniors Dave Johnson and
Rich Monteleone also turned in 8-3 and
8-5 wins, respectively.

On Saturday, the Panthers returned
to Hanes Point to drop a disheartening
5-4 loss at the hands of George Mason

teaming with Chuck DeVera for a 7-6,
6-2 win over Pahn and his partner.
Pablo Dilloroel, but it was not enough
as both of the top two teams fell
decisively.

Sunday saw the Panthers face peren-
nial Big East Champion Boston College
in a match abbreviated by travel
scheduling. However, the Eagles had
swept singles play prior to concluding,
thus being credited with a 6-0 victory.

Coach George Dieffenbach is not at
all displeased with his team’s perform-
ance after taking into account the small
number of matches they have played
and the quality of the opponents which
they have faced. However, he realizes
that there is work to be done.

“It was good to get a win under our
belt, but winning those close matches
is something that takes some match ex-

perience,” Dieffenbach said. “We just
need to get our feet moving, and we’ll
be fine.”

The Panthers now have two more
days to get themselves moving before
they leave for another crucial set of
weekend matches in Philadelphia,
beginning on Friday with archrival
Bucknell. Bucknell has beaten the Pan-
thers men’s tennis teams 30 of the last
31 years. Last year's match ended in
a 5-4 defeat.

“We’ve been sneaking up on them
for a couple of years now,” said Dief-
fenbach. “This year, I think we’re go-
ing to catch them. I predict a 5-4 vic-
tory.”

Coach Dieffenbach’s squad will also
take on Villanova, a sixth-place ﬁnisher
in the Big East last fall, and Lehigh
before returning home on Sunday.
