Students at the University
face a possible tuition raise up-
wards of $70 per term if the
State Legislature refuses_ to
grant the University the $45.3
million it needs to balance its
budget

Because of a lack of state rev-
enue, the Governor has proposed
that the University receive only
$37.9 million” leaving a $7.4 mil-
lion deficit in Pitt’s budgetthat
will have to be made up by a tui-
tion increase and curtailment of

' various programs.

In hopes of gaining the addition-
al $7.4 million. Chancellor Wesley
\\’. Posvar appeared before the
Senate Appropriations Committee
Monday where he presented a re-
view of Pitt's benefits from state
aid arid a preview of Pitt's goals
tor the next ten yearrs.

The Chancellor stressed that
young Pennsylvanians have bene-
titted most from Pitt's five-year
relationship with the state‘ as a
member‘ of the Commonwealth
System of Higher Education and
have gained greater education op-
portunities from Pitts expansion.
He told the committee how a lack’
of state funds will hurt Pitt's
growth. -

Enrollment at the University
has increased by more than 62
percent. from 13.002 f'ull-time stu-
dents in 1965 to 21.018_ this year.
Chancellor Posvar went on to ex-
plain thatgthe composition of the
school's population has changed
too. Eighty-nine percent of the stu-
dent body are now Pennsylvania
residents.

More students from families
having incomes less than $10,000
are now able to attend Pitt; this
year, -53 percent of the freshman
-saw class came" from that income

bracket. A raise in tuition could

stop this trend.

Dr. Posvar‘s presentation in-
cluded a review of the ways Pitt's
various programs have benefitted
the state. For example. a large
amount of college graduates with
higher earning power contribute
more revenue to the state. It also
included an outline of- future plans

J that will be seeking solutions to

such problems as adequate health
care. better educationn. _and pollu-
iion.

The Chancellor concluded. "The
opportunity is here. It is up to the
political leaders and citizens of
the Commonwealth to give Pitt
the means to realize the opportun-
ity and to enrich thereby the hves
of all people." /

=:‘i>

On Tuesday. the Chancellor ex-
plained the possible tuition raise
to the Pitt News. The Department

' of Education has calculated $855
per year to bean appropriate tui-
tion for each of the three state-
related universities. If this tuition
was decided upon. it would mean
an increase of $145 per year or
$72.50 per term. ‘

Against additional tuition hikes,
the Chancellor observed, “We are

_...-.; reaching the 'upper~‘limit_s of our ’

ing to the University.” Referring
to the dubious profit from contin-
ued tuition raises, the Chancellor
remarked, “It is an area of dim-
inishing returns.” -

An increase in tuition would still
not relieve the financial squeeze.
Posvar explained that an increase

Job Scarcity I

Market

This year there is a significant
decline in the number of summer
jobs available to students. The
job scarcity is due mainly to the
unfavorable economic climate
that currently prevails in this na-
tion. ‘

The Federal Reserve Board has
set its prime interest rate at 13

-percent. almost double‘ what it
was one year ago. Consequently.

industryhesitates to borrow from
banks and insurance companies.
Industrial expansion and produc-
tion have slowed. forcing indus-
try to cut down on hiring. '
The administrations move to-
ward “fiscal responsibility" has
shaved off allocations to govern-
mental ‘agencies. As a result. vir-
iually no new jobs have been cre-
ated by the federal government.

A Tom Rush‘, supervisor of Stu-In

CHANCELLOR wésI¢y‘“PosQ§} up-'

 

ty, reports on" the availability of ‘

summer employment: “Last year
we received over one thousand

This year we have received exact-
ly three. Federal agencies, once

of $70 per term would only raise
an additional $4 million. $1 mil-
lion of which would have to be al-
located to student aid. The Chan-
cellor does not want tuition to go
any higher than that. "Anything
above that must come from in-
creased state appropriation or

curtailment of programs next
spring." he asserted.
The Chancellor reasoned that

the L'niversity must wait until
next spring to make-curtailments
"because "of continued possibil-
ities that‘the legislature will pro-
vide more money." Continuing. he
speculated. "Public and school
and welfare programs are so hurt
that there may develop sufficient
pressure to increase revenues to
save those programs-—also to help
us. .

The decision on a tuition hike
will be made by early summer.

riety. "In effect. it's Kennywood
Park at $1.50 an hour and nobody

wants it." It is clear that the stu- -

dent will have to settle for less
this summer.

Females have special difficulty
obtaining summer employment.
At the Student Job Placement
Service over 40 percent of the ap-
plicants were girls. However..out

-' of the-932 students ‘who secured

summer employment last year.
only 64 of them were female. 7
Mr. Rush accounts for the di-
lemma in this way: “To begin
with, there is a scarcity of female
job openings._Also many of the
jobs are located in undesirable
neighborhoods or have hours af-
ter dark. Girls simply won’t take
them. Finally, employers gener-
ally prefer to employ males over
females even if it is‘ a job that a
girl can handle.”

The Job Placement Serviced

makes a special effort to provide
next year‘s seniors with jobs re-
—lated to their major. This year.
civil and industrial engineering
majors were well served but
chemical. mechanical and elec_tri-
cal engineering majors suffered.

by B03 BONN

Dean of Students .\'. Ronald
Pease has announced plans to

leave the L'niversity in order to

take a new position at Rollins
College. Fla. His resignation is
effective June 26.

When questioned by the Pitt
News Pease indicated thathe is
leaving for professional reasons
without hard feelings. and with a
"positive viewpoint." His new job
at Rollins is similar to his posi-
tion here. but also includes duties
in the areas of housing. admis-
sions. and health center facilities.

His future job at Rollins be-
gins on July 6. Rollins. which has
an enrollment of 1.100 students.
is now headed by former Univer-'
sity Vice-Chancellor Jack Critch—
field. .

In referring to his two years at
the. University, Pease said that he
and his staff had put in “two short,
busy, and sometimes frustrating
years.” .

Citing the projects which he
and his staff have undertaken. he
indicated that "the basic frame-
in which this office _can
work" has been formed. "A lot
lias- been accomplished in a short
time." he added. ~

Foremost in the accomplish-
ments was the combining of the
duties of the old deans of men and
women into one job. Also impor-
tant have been the personal advi-
sor program. the reorganization
of student judicial councils. the
coeducational , setup of freshman

into the service.
MURDERS

The blatant murder of the Kent
State College students comes with
no sense of consternation.

Historians bent on discovering
a cure for Americas ills have said
that if reform ever were to be-
come an issue of priority concern
that the Black man would be the
vanguard of the revolution; this
istrue.

This truth will be manifested
when Black people decide to as-
sume this posture. Murders and
political repression that took the
lives of men like Malcolm X. Mar-
tin Luther King and Fred Hamp-
ton all point to a time when men

g gifted immortal vision spoke out

f'or causes they believed were
just. ‘

A comprehensive understanding
of how each problem relates to
both groups should be considered
so as to avoid undue calculations.

The Black Action Society is pre-
pared to support those groups of
people who seek to eradicate so-
cial. economic and political injus-
tice.

Now is the time for all concern-
ed people to stand—one unit sep-
arate of the other—working in
common accord.

NOW TO BRING IT ON HOME

The so-called student strike at
the University of Pittsburgh is an-
other clear example of this Uni-
versity's ability to contain and
control all relevant actions of the
people. i

The history of the past few days
shows a clear co—optation of the
forces of the peoples‘ retribution

‘by the crisis-control elements of

. the University administration.

The tactic has been to move into
the area of the proples demand

speech experts. debate manipula-
tors. etc. in the name of concern-
ed faculty.

A delegation sent to Washing-
ton. D. C.. comes back with the
message that the time for dem-
onstrations is over . . . let's vote
Nixon out in ‘72.

Well. who gave them the mess-
age and who is so sure that they
will be here in ‘72 at the rate that
people are being killed in this
country.

THEN THE older woman with
the perfect hair appeared. She
didn't have the “correct change."
But she was good natured and,
promised not to make the same
mistake again. And he was good
natured and let her by.

She tookher seat near the front
of the bus. arranging her coat
around her. Her face was dry and
her hairdo coiffed.

The others in the bus watched
sullenly. The bus rolled on. the
passengers cookingon the spit.

"Did you see that?" the white
pumps perked up. It was her turn
now. "Over there."

“SURE, sure." the respondent
filled in. "Its all,right in the win-
ter. but that long hair isn't a good

right way.

Butlthe hairdo joined the cycle.

grease from here."

dark glasses for a clearer view.

"These kids today never take a

He was starting to take liberties.

They, were silent’ for at

burgh." 'l‘he crisis control job has
been done well.

This L'niyersity is an extension
of the system which caused the
death of your "peace" brothers
and sisters: this University has
the same CIA agents. the same
defense contracts. the same
ROTC that Kent State has.

This city has the same National
Guard troops on alert. You say.
"If they come. promise us they
won't have live ammunition."

Ask Black people about this.

Look in your 1969 OWL and see
the. National Guard bivouaced in
Pitt Stadium. see the guns. the
tanks and talk to Black people
about unloaded weapons.

Don‘t be a double fool.

Co-optation through crisis con-
trol has already turned your
strike into a pep rally and a picnic.

CLEAR UNDERSTANDING

Black people have a more clear
understanding and recognition of
the contradiction of freedom and
oppression in this country.

Two weeks ago two Black men
were blown to bits in this country.

.1 feel anguish for the four students murdered (there is no other word

for it ). by National Guard troops at Kent State.

And I feel anger and contempt for the man who has betrayed the
hopes of a nationfor peace . . . who has expanded an already futile war
. . and who is causing more American blood to be spilled into an al-
readytoo large pool of red.

It is this man whom I hold ultimately responsible t'or the deaths
not only of those who have died or will die in Southeast Asia (we can no
longer merely say Vietnam) since the beginning of his term in office.

but now also for the deaths of the thousands (and hopefully. ultimately ’

millions) who had the courage to protest his policies.

_ It is the ultimate irony that the man who ran on a platform of unity
. .. who pledged to bring a nation together . . . now has. by his policies.
divided that nation to an unprecedented extent.

Now he lashes out at the‘ violence surging all around him. but he is.

the cause of that violence and he decries only that which he hath
wrought.

And yet.  am powerless to add my voice to the growing number of
those protesting his insanity . . . to those protesting a government
which now not only slaughters its young in the jungles of Vietnam. but
on the streets of Ohio as well. ‘ _

For I am ten thousand miles away. and I am in the Army. and I am
unable to make my anguish and my anger known.

marches. no petitions.

There are many other former ‘Pitt students who share a similar

Dr Cut Funds

(Editor's Note: Letter sent to the
Chancellor of the University of Pitts-
burgh.)

Dear Sir:

Unless you find some way to
control _vour Communist profes-
sors and hippied students, I in-
tend to send a petition to the Leg-
islature to cancel all channelling
of funds to the University of Pitts-
burgh.

Perhaps that may force you into
a small amount of courage to fire
the enemies of America who are
being paid with ourtax money.

As a self-educated man. I used
to think it would be wonderful to
be able to afford a college educa-
tion. Now I feel unclean to come
within miles of your school.

I think it was shameful of Sen-
ator Young of Ohio to refer to the
National Guard as a haven for
draft dodgers. Where, may I ask,
can you find a greater number of
draft dodgers than in the col-
leges? ,

How naive or how political can
you get‘?

I believe 90 percent of my
friends (most of whom would be
classed as the Silent Majority)
feel no regret about the incident at
Kent State. We cannot expect our
National Guard to endure rock-
throwing and vile epithets without
reaction.

God help us, these young peo-
ple are the only ones who will pro-
tect us from your violent revolu-
tionaries who are the real pigs.
Why were there so-called inno—-
cents present at these violent
demonstrations at Kent State?

Take a lessongfrom what hap-
pened at Wall St.. New York, last
week. We are just not going to let
Viet Cong or Russian revolution-

aries ruin our country. I would en-
joy seeing a construction worker
tearing one of your dirty. bearded
professors or students apart.

In conclusion, I have not heard
even one constructive suggestion
as to how to end the war in Viet-
nam coming from your ranks. You
are naive, immature children be-
ing influenced by fanatics or jeal-
ous schemers.

Editor. The Pitt News:

Whatever the experiences of
your life, the blues strikes some
consonant chords from within.
May 8 and May 9 found Carnegie
Music Hall filled with reflections
of the Mississippi Delta and New
Orleans as the Pitt Student Union

expression.

into one with soul.

Some ‘Like’
Their Classes

Editor, The Pitt News:.

I could only attend the last 15
minutes of the rally held May 7
at 1 p.m., but a statement made
by a young lady greatly puzzled
me.

Her explanation for a strike call

Friday, May is, 1970—THE PITT NE:ws—;—Pag¢: 

to wake thepeople up to the fact
and the power of the corporate
machine in America today, and
this would not be accomplished by
attending classes.

So she wants the University
closed so that all may help in the
“Wake Up America” campaign.
If she and her backers need so
much time away, why don’t they
drop from the University for a
couple of terms and then they
could devote 24 hours a day to
their fight and leave the Univer-
sity open to those students who
would like to continue classes.

The Team,

by BILL N AAB
Associate Sports Editor

Only 24 athletes have the opportunity to play varsity.
baseball hereon the Oakland campus. There are more than
5,000 University undergraduate males attending classes,
and certainly there must be a- considerable‘ number of
young men who aredeserving a chance to play.th_e nation-_

’ al game on an intercollegiate basis. - '

The idea of an additional squad (a u‘B’ team) to base-
ball coach Bobby Lewis. However, it would be necessary to
hire another’ baseball coach to work in at least a part-time
position. ’ L ’  ‘ . g ’
....‘‘Alot more fellows would get a chance to play and“

.. there would be alot of schools that we could schedule if ..
'-we would add a .“B«”" team -/nextfyear,"’ Lewis commented.

Right now, "Lewis has an all-senior infield and‘ would
like to provide his younger players a? starting’ job. With “A”
and “B” squads,‘ Lewis would drop some _of his top reserves
from the varsity to the second team‘. Both groups would-
‘maintain 20 man rosters. S  . _ ' - e ,

A “Some of the players'haven’t.had much of a chance,
and I’d like tosee them playing,” Lewis said._“A1.B_-team 

_1 might need them.” A 1 .
This year Athletic Dir.ector_Cas_i-mir Myslinski presented. ~

’ Playing in the’ number one position on the Pitt Tennis team
has had its effect on Tom Stromp‘s tennis strategy. '

Stromp, a senior on the squad. finds that his approach to‘ the

number one spot.

“Recently. I‘ve found that you,
can’t just rely on defense. I‘m

trying to concern myself’ with of-

fense.‘ I‘m trying to ‘attack more

ed a few surprises at Wednesdays .

Indiana Invitational. His sur-
prises. however. were not the
sort which imparts a gratifying
impression upon a coach.

Of the five schools entered at
Indiana. Pa.. Pitt finished fifth.
Peery. nonetheless. stated that
his squad did not produce a poor
effort.

"We did real good. It‘s probably
the best we've ever done at In-

iy surprised at the caliber of Penn
States. Indiana‘s. and Penn's
golfers."

“When only one man on a team
(Penn St.) shoots out of the 70s on
a strange course, it’s great golf.
Penn also surprised me. They did-
n’t look like that much in the East-
ernsf’

For Penn State. it marked the
sixth of seven titles in the Indiana
tourney at the Indiana Country
Club. Indiana's 540 score was nine
strokes off Penn States pace.
while Penn finished with a 546.
Bucknelfs 549 was followed by
Pitts 561. West Virginia was on
the bottom of the heap.

Lee Burke of Penn State was
the medalist with par 72. Jim
Conn of Penn State and Marty Iirb
of Bucknell shot 73s.

On Peery’s squad, four players
shot in the 705. Rick Plonka had a
75, John Kubala 77, Mike Jones 78
and Mike McGuire 79.

Plonks was doing great.

Peery said. “He was at even par
until the 14th hole.

Kubala also performed capably

until he met up with the final hole.
However. Peery didn‘t do any sec-
ond guessing and mentioned
something that is true of any win-
ner: "It's the guys that don’t
make mistakes that -win."
