Rabbi ‘Dares Facing Religion

By MARSHA REHNS
Dare to seek religion from an esoteric
standpoint rather than from an empirical
view, challenged Rabbi Zalman Schachte
Pitcairn-Crabbe lecturer, Monday. ‘

With this challenge Rabbi Schachter an-
swered the problem posed by the possibility
of religious intensity without fanaticism.
Although intensity and tolerance were formerly
considered contradictory, they can be compatible
but only if God is viewed as the ground of man’s

. being. This in turn can beachieved if religion -is

3

  

approached not from an analytical standponit but
if it is “felt in the temper of the present day.”

In the present world there is a bourgeois View
of God, he continued. God is too good, too civilized,
too familiar. To achieve religious intensity, there
cannot be one creed to which all can sign their
names and say they belong-—but an individua_l
searching.  T C

- answered because any reply would necessarily re-

move some people from the table of God. A’

“This is the positive reaction of politeness. What

is needed is an impolite and unsure view of "reli-

gion which accepts tension and which validates reli-
gion through individual experience.

The church, too, makes positive statements in
the form of a formula which states “nothing but”
in religion. To extend religious experience to the
next gener.ation, the teaching formula is “bound
to break” and shed its unbending attitude “like a
used-out epidermis.” V _

If music accompanies teaching, continued the
Rabbi, statements become pliable, not C blocking
learning. To illustrate. his point, Rabbi Shachter
chanted in Hebrew short sections from Leviticus
and Isiah. The ﬁrst by its very music “gives order:
do this, do that.” The second asks “Should I?”

1 Easy Way Out

By BOB SIVIIZIK
It would have been nice to see Bob Timmons go

_ down ﬁghting. But like Sonny Liston, he’s taking the

easy way out. Pitt has a lousy basketball team this
year. Instead of ‘trying to rebuild it Timmons is taking
the Liston way out and has announced that Pitt must
deemphasize in basketball.

He never used that ugly word “deemphasize” in
an interview with Pittsburgh Press, columnist Roy Mc-
Hugh but his words expressed that feeling clearly.

In last Thursday’s Press, Timmons was quoted as

 ' ' saying, “We’re going to have to
. . . and these are the Chancel-
l0r’s words, . . . play schools with
like standards and requirements.
We're trying to pick up more Ivy
League schools. We’re trying to
schedule Brown, we’re trying to
‘ schedule Penn—-any of them we
can get. If we schedule basket-
ball schools, We’re going to get
whacked. And the bas.ketb:‘.=.ll
schools are going to start drop-
~  ping us. It won’t. be any contest
SMIZIK for them."

[Standards Too High , ‘ ,
. What Timmons seems to be saying is that Pitt’s
standards are so tough that it can no longer compete
with V the schools it has been playing against.

_ Funny thing, though. John Michelosen and Rex
Peery have the same standards to ﬁght and they aren't
crying .for softer schedules. And the schedules of the
football and wrestling teams make the basketball team’s
schedule seem like a bunch of breathers.

. What Timmons is actually saying, however, is that
he can’t do the job recruiting-wise. He has shown a
marked inability to bring in top-ﬂight basketball players.

Recruiting‘ Not Impossible ~
Timmons would -have you think, that good athletes
are not smart and hence cannot get in here. But Mich-
elosen.and Peery are proof. that that theory is all wet‘.
Didn’t Michelosen have a 9-1 record in 1963? And didn’t
Peery have the best dual meet team in the East last

  

year? Fact‘ of the matter is, Timmons had a mighty

good team last year. But his gravy train ended when
he lost all ﬁvestarters-'—four of whom he recruited, by
what. must have been a stroke of luck, in 1960.
‘Timmons can look to " Duke and Michigan, two
schools with ﬁne academic :standards if the examples
already shown-‘do not suffice. Both schools have had

” extraordinary success in basketball recently despite,

academic standards which are higher than Pitt’s.

If Timmons thinks there are not enough good, -

smart basketball players to choose from he should look
around at some of the Western Pennsylvania basketball
players who are starring at other schools.

Some Eligible

.. There’s Denny Ferguson of Springdale, Pa., and
Jack Marin of Farrell, Pa. Both start at Duke. There’s
Ron Sepic, starting as a sophomore at Ohio State.
Charlie Schmaus of Ford City, Pa., is a ﬁne player at

VMI. There are others. There’s David Brown of Edge-

wood, Pa., who is starting at Lafayette, and Jeff Neu-
man of Altoona, who is starting at Penn, and there is
Lorry Hathaway, who is starring at Bucknell. ,
All had the academic qualiﬁcations to get into Pitt.
All could start at Pitt. Yet some of the group
Timmons didn’t even want. On some, Marin speciﬁcally,
he did such a poor recruiting job, they wouldn't have

a come here on a bet. ’ 4

_ So, coach Timmons, there are basketball players
with the brains to get into Pitt. r

Drop the .MountcIineers? ,
Timmons further demonstrated his desire to “Lis-
ton-it” in the same column by_ saying he would also like

‘to drop West Virginia from the schedule. Why not?

What's a traditional rivalry? Pitt’s only played West
Virginia 101 times. ~ ‘ ,

Poor little Carnegie Tech can continue to play Pitt,-

but Timmons doesn’t want his boys_to play West V11‘-

mia.
g lf Timmons is Sonny Liston, then Tech coach Mel
Cratsley must be Rocky Marciano.

This is no knock at Timmons’ coaching ability. He's
come a long way since he took over the Pitt job. No-
body can knock a coach on his ability to teach the game
when that coach has taken his teams to tournaments
for the past two years. i

Effort Lacking .
. ‘What we. do knock him for_is not just his inability
good ball players, but now for his apparent

Rees Looks to Successful Season  ‘

Panthers lost badly to both of the service_ acadeiniesl. ; 

“We’1l be a better team this year even though
our two top point scorers from last year's squad,
Joe Friend and Al Thomassey, are gone.” This state-
ment by track coach Carl Rees and echoed by sev-
eral track members of‘ his squad points out the track
‘team’s ‘conﬁdence in having a successful indoor
campaign.

Coach Rees has a solid nucleus of athletes re-
turning from last year: relay men Dick Croute, Bill
DelVecchio, Luddy Hayden .and pole'vaulter Mort
Stanﬁeld. Added to this group are the distance run-
ners who recently went through an undefeated sea-
son in cross-country: John”Bailey, Dave Eichenlaub.
Frank Handelman and Damien‘Koch.

“The overall outlook is good at this point,” said
‘Rees, “but we are, still a. full week from our open-
ing meet with Kent State. We know nothing at all
about Kent since this is their initial meet also. Last
year they beat our freshmen handily.” The Pan-
thers’ second opponent, Slippery Rock, lost last
year’s meet with the Panthers by 53-38 when they
dropped both the mile and two mile relays.
The ﬁnal two meets are with Army and Navy,
both of which are strong teams. Last year the

 
 
  

Their strength comes not only from the quality ‘O;

performers, but also from the fact that they_ ﬁeld‘;
very large squads; they can enter freshmen in each 
event without doubling up as otherteams must ’ , .

According to Coach Rees, Luiddy"*I-Iayden*is  ; 
best bet to pick up points for the team. He  — 
running the 50 or 60-yard high hurdles. one 

event, and the broad jump.

John Bailey and Dave Eichenlaub will   
be the best distance men based on last year’: show- ,’  
ings. in track and cross-country". Reeswill count on "T I.‘ 
Mort Stanﬁeld to take up the —~ slack in the ﬁeld . I

events left by the loss of Al Thomassey. “Mort does

not excel in any single event," says Rees, “but his   fl’
is a good point scorer and does well in his   ’

ties.”

Coach Rees emphasized that a successful season

hinged on how healthy his athletes remained. “Don

Hincheberger, a top scorer last_ year, is recovering  .
from a knee operation and is out indeﬁnitely.’  

other good distance runner, Jim Studnicki, is ham}; ~.- .

methods and select the best equipment to handle each
type of problem. If your college experience has. taught you
to organize information and approach a problem system-
atically, see IBM.

An IBM Data Processing Representative shows customer
executives how IBM can help business become .more effi-
cient. ln selling to business, industry, government, or
defense, you use your own initiative and individuality. Ad— .
vancement comes as you develop skills acquired in college.

Thorough initial training will teach you the techniquesof
data processing and marketing computers. If you are look-
ing for opportunities to grow, join IBM. Your placement
office can give you our literature—or make an appoint-
ment with our interviewers. IBM is an Equal Opportunity
Employer.

Interviews February 8-9 A
