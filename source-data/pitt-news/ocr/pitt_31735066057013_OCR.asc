W-courses are soon to be linked to major

By Stacy Browning
Staff Writer '

It is time for registration, and College
of Arts and Science seniors are scram-
bling to find easy introductory courses
to satisfy their general education “W”
requirements, so they can graduate.

If you are like 78 percent of CAS stu-
dents,-you enroll in an English or philos-

A ophy W-course even though thewriting

in that course probably will not have
anything to do with your designated
major. -

This will begin to change in the sum-
mer of 1994. The Faculty of Arts and
Sciences has approved a proposal imple-
menting a new “programmatic writing
requirement.” This requirement will
make it mandatory for undergraduate
CAS.students to take a W-course in their
chosenmajor.

“The idea is that students should learn
to write in their language of discipline,”
CAS Assistant Dean Linda Burns said. “I
think it’s definitely an improvement.”

Three years ago the dean’s office con-

ducted a study to find out which courses
were being taken to satisfy the writing
requirements. They found students pre-
dominantly taking introductory courses

in the English and philosophy depart—'

ments.

According to the dean’s office, the
intent of the W-course requirement was
so that students could learn to write in
the language of their major discipline,
after -fulfilling their composition require-
ment. This was based on the concept of
“Writing Across the Curriculum.” This,
however, has not been the case.

In modifying the existing requirement,
CAS students will have to take one W-

course in any department of their choice '

and another W-course in their major
department. ’ . '
Wherever possible, CAS departments
will modify existing courses to fulfill the
programmatic writing requirement. The
departmental “W” maybe a single
course or it may be a combination of
several courses. _
The classes willcontinue to be taught
by professors in each particular depart-

ment. The major change will be that stu-
dents have to write between 20 and 24
pages and will have to do revision work.
Research papers due at the end of a
course, without prior consultation, will
not be appropriate for this requirement.

“The key is that students will get feed-
back on their writing and will do revi-
sions of their writing,” Burns said.

All‘ departments have to submit‘
course proposals to the Writing
Board by the fall of 1994. The Board,
which is comprised of faculty from vari-
ous CAS departments, will have to
approve the proposed curriculum modi-
fications. ‘

Students entering CAS in the fall of
1994 will have to fulfill this new require-
ment be-fore graduation. Currently
enrolled students will have the option of
completingtwo standard W-courses or

‘one W-course and a departmental W-
course in their major, ‘if a W-course has L

been approved.

Advisors will inform students of
departmental  options as they
become available.‘ ’

After the Faculty Assembly called for the
university to clear the name of lead toxicity
researcher Herbert Needleman, Needleman
sincerely thanked them for the resolution,

A resolution was brought before the
assembly at yesterday’s meeting calling for
the administration and some federal agen-
cies to move toward bringing full revelation
of all findings in the case so that the public
has full knowledge of it. «

“The university has an obligation to allow
the entire document to be available for
open scrutiny,” biological science Professor
Fredrick J. Gottleib said. “The university,
disproving this conduct, has the responsi-
bility to do what it can in all due haste to
reconstruct and rehabilitate the reputation
of Professor Needleman.”

Needleman, who published the results of

a 1979 study linking low levels of lead
exposure to decreased IQs in children, has
been trying to regain his reputation follow-
ing the 1991 accusations of two psycholo-
gists-who claimed he misrepresentedhis
results.

After a year-long investigation by Pitt, the
Office of Research Integrity found no evi-
dence of “fabrication” or “falsification of
data, procedures or analysis that would bias
the results in favor of finding a harmful
effect for lead on the neuropsychological
development of young children.” '

Since this ruling, the university adminis-
tration has declined to help Needleman pay
off his $50,000 legal debt. It has also have
not publicized the documents explaining
the case findings. -

The main purpose of the resolution from
the Senate Committee is to speed things up
and get some administrative action.

Thoma, _ a resident
assistant in Lothrop
Hall.“‘In fact, we had a
petition out for a few
hours and got 240 sig-
natures on it to ask
that Lothrop cafeteria
be reopened on the
weekends.” .

After taking over
Pitt’s dining services
last semester, the
Marriot Food Catering
Service reorganized the
system at the adminis-
tration’s request. In a
cost—cutting move, the
weekend service at
Lothrop was eliminated
for the spring term.

Hollan's main abition is to make a difference

By Stacy Browning
Staff Writer

It was the day before a big Vietnam anti-war
rally in Pittsburgh, when Pitt researcher James
G. Holland walked into the elite Duquesne
Club for lunch. But it wasn’t food that Holland
and the nine others with him had on their
minds.

Before the busy lunchtime crowd, Holl-and
and the others got up and read their anti-war
statement, then were arrested and taken to jail.

“We placed blame for the war where it
belonged, with the titans of industry,” Holland
said.

Holland, a psychology professor, said he
wants to make a difference in the world, and it
doesn’t matter if he is in a research lab, at lec-
ture hall, the jungles of South America or a
Pittsburgh club.

He said hisimpact can be felt because when
he feels strongly about something he will
speak out intensely with the hope of making
his ideas known.

Many of Holland’s ideas can be found in his
three books on psychological research and
education. One of the books is an instructional
program which he co-authored with renowned

psychologist B.F. Skinner.

Within the Pitt community, Holland is well
known not only as a researcher but also as the
President of the University Senate, a position
he has held since June 1992. He also presides
over the Faculty Assembly and Senate Council.

Holland, 65, has been at Pitt since-1965
when he was asked to come and do research
at the Learning, Research and Development
Center. Although Holland is now dedicated to
education and research in the psychological
field, his devotion to his own education didn’t
come about until his first year at the College
of William and Mary.

“I became quite serious about education and
found it fascinating and enjoyable and interest-
ing and have ever since,” Holland said.

At the end of Holland’s senior year in high
school he joined the Marine Corps, leaving
high school at the age of 17 to fight in World
War II.

“I had bigger things on my mind than gradu-
ating from high school,” Holland said. “I didn’t
think it much mattered because I didn’t expect
to see 25 anyway. World War II was a very all-
consuming kind of war, and just being 17 and
able to go off and fight it was all that mattered

Pharmacy students plan meal donations

president of Professional
Services for ASP.

An animal activist
group donated the din-
ner and ASP volunteers
served it to a group
of about 20 homeless
women.

“Dinner was really sad,”
Jaskulski said.

“It was meatless, but I
guess better than nothing at
all.”

Because the meal wasn't
as nutritious as ASP had
hoped, the group plans to

donate as well as serve din-‘

ner once in March and again
in April.

The shortened hours will
affect Sutherland Ha1l’s cafe-
teria during the fall term and
Lothrop during the spring.

“The closing of Lothrop
cafeteria on the weekends
during the spring semester is
not meant to cause any
inconvenience for anyone on
the campus,” said Betsy
Farina, food service director.

The food service sent a let-
ter last fall to all residence
hall students explaining the
new hours and explaining
how to avoid problems,
according to Farina. But
Thoma said the changes
have caused inconvenience.

“The Towers cafeteria gets
overcrowded and we have to
wait half an hour to get food
sometimes,” Thoma said.
“Lothrop Hall holds 700 stu-
dents, and were locked into
‘choice dollars’ contracts that
are limited to certain places
other than the main cafete-
rias.”

Farina said there are griev-
ance forms in each of the
cafeterias for students to fill
out if they have any prob-
lems.

“We are always looking for
feedback from students of
how the cafeterias are,”
Farina said. “My job is to

While thanking the assembly
for the resolution, Needleman
also admitted that there was a
small error in his research that
was misrepresented, but it was
an honest mistake, not intentional.
In a 40-page report he explained
the reasons behind this mistake.

“I would like this to be public. I
would like the whole record to be
public, every piece of correspon-
dence. I will pay for the xerox to put
it in the library so anybody can read
the record and evaluate it,”
Needleman said.

“That’s what we are suppose to be
trained to do is evaluate evidence.
That‘s what this university should be

doing."

Communication Professor
Thomas Kane moved that this
resolution be put on the

Senate Council agenda.

Faculty Assembly President James
Holland urged assembly members to

that if it doesn’t have a large audi-
ence it will work against their

Fighting harassment

On Monday, the Supreme Court agreed to rule on a case that will
have a major impact on sexual harassment cases across the country.

Teresa Harris, an employee at Forklift Systems, Inc., claims in her ,

suit that the company’s president, Charles Hardy, had asked her to
retrieve coins from his pants pocket, joked about about going to a
motel “to negotiate your raise,” threw objects on the floor and then
asked her. to pick them up and committed various other acts that
could be considered sexual harassment.

The lower courts threw out the lawsuit, claiming that she was
offended but had not suffered “severe psychological injury.”

Under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, women who are sexually
harassed can sue for up to $300,000 from their employer. However,
the sexual harassment standard is based on unwelcome verbal or
physical conduct that interferes with an individual’s performance, or
creating “an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.

Federal Magistrate Ken Sandidge III said that he believed that
Hardy was a “vulgar” man who demeans his female employees. But

‘ he thought that Harris did not prove that she was confronted with a

hostile work environment.

This may be dense, but if the court agrees that these incidents
occurred it is hard to believe that there is a -question about whether
or not this is more than an “annoyance.” The incidents sound like
nothing less than a continuing humiliating experience that is bound

I . , .
to have consequences on this woman s life.

No one, male or female, should have to take that kind of treat-

. ment. This is an opportunity for the Court to make a strong state-

ment about this nation’s intolerance of the existence of sexual
harassment in the workplace. Employers like Hardy would think
twice if they thought that their “fun” would lead to swift and
expensive justice. - A

The core requirements for students of the University of Pittsburgh
are changing once again, and they are changing for the better.

New CAS requirements

The College of Arts and Sciences is planning to implement a
requirement that would make it mandatory for students to take one
of the two W-courses currently required within their chosen majors.
The other one may be in an area of their choice. This will be put
into action in late 1994 and will affect students ‘entering CAS that
fall. ‘ -

. ’ The motivation for this move was based on the fact that most stu-
dents were taking their W-courses in introductory philosophy and
English courses no matter what their majors were. “Writing across
the curriculum,” the original intent of the W—course, should become
the aim of all CAS students. But, students didn’t end up taking W-

courses in their areas of study along with one in another area. With

this new restriction in effect, students will be better acquainted with
writing in their “language of discipline.”

Writing is an important part of the learning experience, and not
just for English writing majors. It is important for science majors,
like biology or engineering, to learn how to write in their own
interest area or specialty. Technical writing is quite different from
fiction or essay writing. When a student in the communications
department takes a fiction or essay writing course, he or she is not
learning anything about his or her designated field or major.
However, ‘if the student were to take a course along the lines of
how to write an argument in rhetoric, her or she would find that
more useful.

CAS departments will adapt to encompass this new requirement.
CAS departments’ existing courses will be modiﬁed to fulfill the W5
necessary for the programs. Some of the courses will be a. single
course or a combination of several courses. Requirements will be
20 to 24 pages’ and revisions for most classes.

Animal research important

I agree with Mark Fleck’s arti-
cle, “Animal research is essen-
tial for human progress” in the
Feb. 16 issue of 7799 Pitt News.
Animal research is important for
the welfare of mankind. I also
agree that it is a researcher’s
responsibility to be humane in
conducting his/ her research.

I think it is important for
everyone to have issues they
believe in. I have to give the
animal rights people credit for

-believing in something enough

to speak up and get involved. I
just have a few questions for
them. What are they doing to
help the men and women who
are illiterate, homeless, hungry,
etc.? For those who are protest-
ing the baboon liver transplant,
are you carrying an organ

Gays don't lit in military team

In response to your editorial

it would seem to me that the

services.

that you didn’t seem to consid-

would add a sexual tension that
would harm -the military’s readi-
ness and effectiveness. For this
very same reason men and

women in the military are not‘

housed together. Where would

homosexuals fit into this pic-.

ture?

I’m sure that gays could do
their jobs and fight just as well
as heterosexuals could, but
one’s— individual ability is not
what makes the military tick. It’s

LETTERS

how well you work in a team
that matters. The United States

to allow gays into the military.
Gays would not be accepted,
hence the armed forces would
suffer.

Until homosexuality becomes
more socially acceptable, gays
should not be allowed to serve.
The job of the military is to fight

Living in AmeriKKKa
“Concentrate on the Present,”
by Micheal Gilbert, is an.
extremely great example of the
blatant ignorance and racism
that continues to exist in
AmeriKKKa. Mr. Gilbert tells_ the
reader that he is a “conservative
white male” with a German and
Italian ancestry. The reason he
has survived for his 20 years is
he represents the majority that
continues to deprive the minori-
‘ pl;iijC in
AmeriKKKa. ‘Gilbert also says
he is not taught his history. Our

history books teach all about
the contributions
Germans and Europeans have
made to AmeriKKKa. Your his-

tory is taught from third grade i~

throughout college, and not
only that, it is taught from your
perspective, which is not true.
African__Americans built this
country, as well as other
minorities. It is an untruth to
depict us as having been sav-
ages ,“rescued” from Africa to
soon be freed by Lincoln. There
is quite a bit more to the real
story.

Gilbert tells the reader that
“Asians and Indians  managed
to succeedwithout their history
being taught in schools.” Asians
succeed because they do not
send anyone to AmeriKKKa if
they are not wealthy or highly
intelligent, and since they are
coming from their homeland it

would be obvious that they ,‘

know their ancestry. Indians are
not succeeding in AmeriKKKa
by any means. Indians have the
highest death rate, the govern-
ment is not strongly supporting
the protection of their reserva-
tions and their high school
drop-out rate is higher than any
other minority in AmeriKKKa.

We do not consider ourselves ’

AmeriKKKan because the con-
tributions that the African
Americans have made to
AmeriKKKa are not included in
AmeriKKKan history. Mr. Eybers

American, yet you do not need

J PHILADELPHIA — For two

recent past last night. And for
the Panthers, it couldn’t have
come at a more critical time.
In perhaps the biggest “W” in
a season full of big tumarouhd
‘ wins — a 77-76 squeaker over
Villanova — Pitt survived to see
ar_1other rebirth in its hopes for
_ an NCAA tournament bid.
Those hopes are alive in large
part due to the efforts of Shareef
and McNeal — the former a
recent benchee and the latter a
recent no-show until last night.
In his second consecutive
strong showing, McNeal gritted
and gauled his way to 22 points
and eight rebounds. As for
Shareef, who was benched for
the Georgetown game after
starting 20 of Pitt’s 22 games, his
contributions were simply
clutch.‘ .
Replacing Antoine Jones with
5:49 left in regulation (Jones had
fouled out) Shareef nailed two
jumpers, grabbed two big
rebounds and drained three
foul shots in the ﬁnal minute to
seal a crucial victory for the 17-8
Panthers.

Chris McNeal sure found a way «

“I think Ahmad really won
the game for us in the end
with those free throws,” Antigua
said. “[Villanoval thought he
wouldn’t make those free
throws, and he came in and
made them.”

For Chicago native Shareef —
who played the game with a
left thigh bruise — the surprise
of losing his starting job didn’t
affect his performance. He

Shareef said of his benching.

PHILADELPHIA — Last night,
the Pitt Panther basketball team
sent a message to critics who said
that Sunday’s ugly Big East win
over Georgetown was nothing
more than a brief remission from its
late—season nose dive.

Playing with the unbridled inten-
sity and desperate urgency of a
team clearly ﬁghting forits postsea-
son life, Pitt clawed its way to a 77-
76 win over a snake-bitten
Villanova club.

“We came in saying we really
needed this,” junior guard Ahmad
Shareef said. “We wanted to pay
them back for what they did at our
place.”

For Pitt (17-8, 9-8 in the Big
East), duPont Pavillion has tradi-
tionally been one of the toughest
arenas to play in. This was the
Panthers’ first win here since the
1987-88 season.

For Villanova (8-17, 3-14), this
was just another gut—wrenching
loss in a honid season of tantaliz-
ingly close heaitbreaks.

Senior Chris McNeal stepped up

. with 22 points and eight rebounds

to lead the Panthers, but no single
player can be singled out in this
one. Shareef, Orlando Antigua and
Antoine Jones all made crucial con-
tributions on a night where Pitt
busted loose to hit 50 percent of its
ﬁeld goals.

messagewith 77-76 win at Villanova

Shareef’s jumper with 2:12
remaining gave Pitt a 74-69 cush-
ion. The Panthers had a chance to
widen their margin, but Villanova’s
press forced Antigua into a key
tumover. Allconference swingman
lance Miller was fouled driving to
the basket and converting a pair of
free throws to bring the Wildcats
within 74-71 with just 1:25 to go.
The Villanova press paid further
dividends with a double-team
which caused Shareef to_ slip and
fall for a crucial tumover two sec-
onds later.

Miller stepped up with. a tough
bucket inside, powering through
two Panther defenders underneath
to slice Pitts lead to just 74-73 with
only a minute remaining. Kerry
Kittles fouled Shareef, and the
rangy junior missed the front end
of a one-and-one, giving the ‘Cats a
chance to take the lead.

Miller made another clutch play,
penetrating and kicking the ball to
a wide-open Kittles beyond the
three-point arc. Kittles wasted the
opportunity when he misfired.
Shareef gained redemption climb-
ing for a big rebound and nailing
two crucial free throws to make it
76-73 Pitt.

The Panther defensive intensity
proved to—be the decisive factor in
the end as Miller was forced into
missing a tough three-point attempt
from the left comer. Shareef skied
for the rebound again and cement-
ed the outcome with another free

throw. Pitt lead byfour with just six
seconds remaining, making Kittles’
three—pointer at the buzzer inconse-
quential.

Villanova entered the game on a
five-game losing streak and winless
in the Big East since shocking Pitt
82-76 back on Feb; 3 at the Civic
Arena. But this was senior night at
duPont Pavillion and a trio of
Wildcat seniors lit it up in the open-
ing 20 minutes as Villanova
grabbed a 46-58 lead. Forwards
Aaron Bain and Calvin Byrd
pumped in 11 points apiece while
Miller, who finished with 19 points
and 11 rebounds, added nine
points and seven boards in the
opening half.

“We knew that they were going
to come out pumped — it being
senior night,” Antigua said. “Those
guys wanted to come out and do
well in front of their parents.. We
knew that in the second half they
Couldn’t shoot as well as they did
that half. They could have threw it
in backwards'from three, and it
would have went in.” ‘

The Wildcats scorched the nets
at a 55 percent Clip while running
out to leads as big as 12 points at
43-31. Pitt battled back courtesy of
a 7-0‘ run to narrow the deficit to
eight at the half. _

Lemieux comes back firing

ByRyanBuncher

Sports Editor

The fans in thespectrum rose in a standing ovation
last night, but it was not because the Philadelphia
Flyers beat the Penguins 5-4. It was for Mario Lemieux.

As the puck was dropped for the opening faceolf, it
was Lemieux facing off with Eric Lindros. On the same
day as his last radiation treatment, Lemieux ﬂew out to
Philadelphia and played his first game since being

diagnosed with _Hodgkin’s disease.

The Flyers dominated the early part of the gamevas
they rolled to a 5-1 lead in the second period.

Then the puck came to Lemieux on the left circle.
Flyer goalie Dominic Roussel was not set for a shot,
normally a fatal mistake against Lemieux. This time,
however, it was Iiemieux’s first game in two months,

so maybe he’s not sharp.

Superstars returrz just in time for Pens

Mario Lernieux’s return to the
Penguin lineup is just in time.

The Penguins played
respectably without their leader
and best player, but their 11-10-2
record heading into last night’s
contest against Philadelphia was a
far cry from the 28-9-4 record
they ran up before Lemieux went
out of the lineup in early January.

Lately, the Pens’ playing has
been atrocious — losing to
Ottawa and tying Tampa Bay
(both expansion teams). Over the
last 10 games, the Pens have
reeled off a record of 4-5-1, not
very impressive for the two-time
Stanley Cup champions.

It started off well enough when
Lemieux went out of the lineup
when the Pens compiled a record

1
4.‘ .

Then again maybe his is. I.emieux fired a wrist shot
by Roussel to bring the Penguins within a goal and
finally rack up his 40th goal of the season.

Minutes later, he picked up an assist on a power-
play goal by Kevin Stevens.

Lemieux also drew a penalty to set up a power—play
goal by Stevens that tied the game at four. After strug-
gling miserably with the man advantage in recent
games, ‘the Pens scored on their first three chances, all J
with Lemieux on the ice.

Lemieux’s added offense wasn’t enough as Gary

merits.

Galleys shot trickled in off Tom Barrasso’s pads for the
C game-winner late in the third period.

suffering some fatigue ‘because of the radiation treat-

strength back,” Lemieux said after the game.

of 9-5-1 up until Feb. 13, but then
they ran out of gas.

The main problem has been’
scoring, strange on a team loaded
with this much offensive talent.
During their 4-5-1 streak,-the

Jim
Clark

Penguins have scored only 30
goals. This is from ;r team that
normally scores well over four
goals a game.
To make the offensive woes all

the more difficult is that the
power play is struggling. The

Penguins have not been able to
put the puck in the net with the
man advantage, without Lemieux-.
The struggling power play shows
that the Penguins could stand to
use a real pointman, especially
when Lemieux is out.

With number 66 in the lineup,
they can get away with Ron
Francis on the point. But without
Lemieux, Francis is needed down
at center, leaving Mike Stapleton
or Ulf Samuelsson (hardly offen-
sive threats) playing the left point.

And a surprise for a Penguin
team is that defense, not offense,
is keeping them in games. During
their 10-game slump, the Pens
have held the opposition to 30
goals. But if there is a concern for

Friend makes childhood pastime, coach's gamble pay dividen

ByTodd S. Rimer
.S‘ta_ﬂ“Writer

Alisha Friend’s gymnastics career
began 15 years ago at the very
young age of 4 when her mother
enrolled her in a dance and gym-
nastics school.

“WhenIwas4yearsoldIwasa
very hyper and energetic child,”
Friend said. “I was constantly
bouncing off the walls, doing for-
ward rolls in the living room and
knocking over lamps and other
pieces of furniture, so my mom
made me begin dance and gym-
nastics to hopefully help release
some of my energy.”

Now a sophomore at Pitt, Friend
is a key to the success of the
Panther gymnastics team.

Friend, who is co—captain of the
team, came to Pitt because she was
offered a scholarship. But what
convinced Friend to come here
was that she  the campus, the

team and, most importantly, the
coaches.”

Friend feels that the balance of a
male coach, Ben Rovee, and a
female coach, Debra Yohman, is
beneficial to her and the team.

“Deb is there to keep the team
disciplined and focused while Ben
is there to keep us upbeat and
energetic,” Friend said.

The feeling of admiration is reci-
priocated by Yohman.

“Alisha is one of the best and
hardest working gymnasts I have
ever worked with,” Yohman said
“She has definitely performed
beyond my expectations.”

Friend said she feels a great deal
of gratitude toward Pitt for recruit-
ing her. During her junior year of
high school Friend sulfered a knee
injury and had to undergo surgery
to repair ligament damage. This
caused her status as a potential col-
legiate-level competitor to be ques-
tionable at best

The coaches travelled all the way
to New Jersey to evaluate her and
detemiine whether she was recruit-
ing material. They saw a few of her
routines, along with a couple of
films, and they were impressed
with her talent.

“I definitely took a chance when
deciding to recruit Alisha because
there was no guarantee that her
knee would allow her to perform
to her potential again,” Yohman
said. “Fortunately, neither Alisha
nor her knee has disappointed us.”

For Yohman, this is one invest-
ment that has proven to generate
high dividends for the team.

Friend said that her first year of
competition was not as successful
as she would have liked it to have

been. She had to wear a knee
brace as she continued to recover
from surgery. She missed half of
the season because of tonsillitis,
limiting her to being able to com-
pete in only seven of the team’s
meets.

Friend earned respectable scores
during those meets in which she
was able to compete. She recorded
average scores of 9.1 on vault, 8.7
on bars, 8.6 on beam and an
impressive 9.4 on ﬂoor. In the one
meet where she was able to com-
pete in the all-around, she tallied a
total of 37.05.

Friend said she had a strenuous
and difficult offseason in order to
bounce back in preparation for this
season.

worked out in the gym for about
10 hours a week,” Friend said

the team’s defense, it is that it’s
playing too much. Larry Murphy
and Ulf Samuelsson are putting in
way too much ice time while
aging Kjell Samuelsson should be
given a rest here or there.

It might make sense to call up
a defenseman like Paul Laus, Paul
Dyck or Todd Nelson from
Cleveland to play a game here or
there and give the veterans a
break.

But unlike the last two years,
when the Penguins took their
new year nose dives and were
forced to make major deals, don’t
expect a major move this season.
Unlike those past two seasons,

at ‘k ‘Ar 9|CE$HRE°cEHGl.£R oneseu sat at «x

the Penguins are a lock to make
the playoffs.

Besides, a major deal isn’t nec-
essary.

They needed defense in 1991
and they got it with Ulf
Samuelsson and Francis. last
year, they needed further defen-
sive help and they got it with
Rick Tocchet and Kjell
Samuelsson. This year, the team
is strong at all positions.

These deals proved to be
sparks that ignited the Penguins
through the playoffs. This year,
the return of Lemieux should
have that same effect.

The Pitt News.

her career high on bars with a
9.7, placing her fourth on the all-
time list. Her all-around score for
the meet was a total of 57.75
points,10th among Pitt’s all-time
best

That was only the beginning
of great numbers for Friend. last
week’ against Ball State she
earned career highs with a 9.4 on
beam and on vault. Fn'end’s best
meet was against George
Washington a couple of weeks
ago when she tied her career
best on beam with a 9.4 and also
put forth her best effort with an

all-around score of 38.0, fifth best
on Pitt’s all—time list.

Consistency is a key for Friend.
She has not scored lower than a
35.85 in the all—around the entire
season. Throughout the first
seven meets, she is averaging a
37.05 as an all-arounder, which
means she is averaging a 9.5 on
each event.

“I am happy with my efforts
this season thus far, but it is not
enough for me,” Friend said. “I
still have many more goals to
achieve.”

Those goals include the
school’s ﬂoor record, the highest

bar score and Pitfs record in the
all-around. Friend’s teammate,
Meg Johns, feels that her attitude
is appreciated during practice
and in the meets.

“Alisha is always calm and
cool,” Johns said. “No matter
what happens she is conﬁdent
and attempts to cheer the team
up.”

Friend said that she is a perfec-
tionist.

“I am never satisﬁed with my
performance,” Friend said. “If I
fall more than once in a meet, I
am so embarrassed. It only helps
to motivate me to do better.”

game.

According to Antigua, McNeal’s
play in this game should all but
silence critics who said he had all
but packed it in at the critical end
of the season.

“It’s coming down to crunch
time and Chris is taking all the crit-
ics and shoving their words back in

their mouths,” Antigua said. “He’s
stepping up, hitting the big shots
for us . . .he’s rebounding very well.

“He’s stepping up very big for
us.”

Both Shareef and McNeal credit
an upsurge in offensive maturity for
improving their respective games
as well as the team’s effort.

offense,” Shareef said. “Patient. Not
coming down the court and ﬁring
up the first shot.”

“We started out being more
patient with our offense,” McNeal
said. “We were patient and got
open shots.”

For Shareef, thewin doesn’t auto-
matically mean NCAA time. He and
Antigua point to Saturdays game at
Syracuse as a must for Pitt to secure
a tourney bid.

“We’re still trying to ﬁnish above
.500 in the conference,” Shareef
said. Antigua concurred — with a
bit of revenge in mind to boot.

‘Vt/e’ve still got to beat lSyraQ}sel

at the Civic Arena, so we owe
