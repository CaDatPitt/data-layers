UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Packard Discusses U.S.,

Its Internal Upheaval I

By BERNI McLEOD
“The man who has bridged the gap between social sci-
ence and the general public,” Vance Packard, author of The
Status Seekers and The Hidden Pursaud'ers, spoke Wednes-
day at a noon Public Affairs Series program on “America

W 5‘ in Upheaval.” .

With encyclopedic knowledge of facts, figures and quotes,

I 7’ some interesting, many dull, Pack-

ard devoted his speech to ex-
plaining m o d e rn technological
change and its effect upon Amer-
ican society.

Modern technology, like the
old American frontier, has in-
ﬂuenced the value system and
economic practices in’ our coun-
try, Packard noted. In fact, ad-
vancing technology has served to
replace many of‘ the old values
with new ones such as approval
of giant ' organizations, respect
for education, and desire for im-
mediate gratiﬁcation. One of the
most outstanding results of tech-
nological change, however, is the
great growth in the productive
capacity of American businesses
and -industry.

Quoting an American economic
specialist Packard noted, “If our
economy is to continue to rise,
each American must learn to con-
sume 50 per cent more in the
coming years.” Since so much
production output is in the form

r of luxury items, this would mean
more billions of dollars on multi-
lingual dolls, bubble bath, and
such “beauty aids” as Clairol’s
“Great Day” for men.

The public, when it comes to
emptying their wallets, needs
prodding. This is unfortunate, as
Packard stated, when such towns
as Emporia, Kansas, have 63 gas

stations and hardly a fraction of
the need. As a consequence, busi-
ness has had to rely increasingly
upon advertising.

‘Today we have six.per cent
of the World’s population,” said
Packard, “and 60 per cent of the
advertising. The average persons
spends 300 hours at year listen-
ing to television commercials.”

Advertising, in turn, has looked
toward the social sciences to ﬁnd
ways of inﬂuencing the public
mind. By‘ attaching status to -a
product, large numbers of people
feel ‘compelled to purchase it.

“The brassiere industry,” ex-
plained Packard, “has succeeded
in convincing nine and ten year
olds that they ought to wear bras.
This is what I call a remarkable
achievement of modern (market-
ingup . ‘

To conform to the emphasis on
increased consumption, the gov-
ernment has shifted its interest
from managing a balanced ﬁscal
budget, to cultivating “happy
consumers and tax payers.” The
objective is to keep dollars ﬂow-
ing into a steadily rising ‘eco-
nomy. »

“Most of you will live in the

‘ 21st century,” concluded‘ ‘Pack-

ard, “Will these new changes
sustain an enduring style of life
for future decades on this
planet?” ‘

Special Session Ruled Out
By Scranton Until State Tie

With University Formulated  

The idea of calling a special
session of the state legislature
General Assembly to consider
making the University_ a state-
related school is premature un-
til the University states its views,
A. James Reichley, special assis-

'tant to Governor William W.

Scranton, said recently.

When asked ‘the governor’s
view after the passage of a res-
olution in the House of Repre-
sentatives urging such a session,
Reichley replied, “Only when a
plan has been advanced agree-
able both to the State Board of
Education and the Pitt trustees
will the governor seriously con-
sider calling the special session.”

A spokesman for the University
said that the trustees, administra-
tion and the faculty are study-
ing several plans. The Universi-
ty’s views is expected to be an-
nounced in a few weeks.

One plan is a contract ar-
rangement in which the under-
graduate school would become
state-related, as ‘proposed last
week by a Ford Foundation study
committee. Another plan is simi-
lar to that of Temple University,
"where the entire.’ school is state-
Local organizations,haveﬂlaun h"-;

for a special legislative session.
Such groups as the Allegheny
Conference on Community Devel-
opment, the county commission-
ers, the Urban League of Pitts-
burgh and the county school
board are involved.‘ A

' The state of state relatedness
would have to be handled ‘in a‘
special session since the regu-
lar session this year is limited to
ﬁscal matters.

A Man To Know

By FRED FRANK

I tried to remember where
my next class was, but I con-
sciously realized I didn’t want to
be bothered with the banal. I
concentrated on the ﬂag at half
mast before me and I realized
with a peculiar pride that I knew
that man for whom- the ﬂag was
lowered.

When I found out that he was
dead, I knew there would be no
mass hysteria. Unlike Kennedy,
he was the/type of leader that
had to be known and observed.

While I always imagined my-
self the iconoclast rather than
a builder of deities, I knew, that
there was-a.man to be praised
and memorialized. It was the re-
sponsibility of those who knew
him to communicate their sense
of loss. A W

Last December, ‘ I had been
able ‘to wangle a spot on Dr.
.Crawford’s crowded schedule. I
had met him‘ before., but this was
to be my ﬁrst opportunity for
uninterrupted conversation.

While on my way to the inter-
view I thought over the violent
reaction a rather varied group
of people, had had to criticism

of Dr. Crawford made earlier in
the term.“ _
Chance bits of information had
somehow made me comprehend
this reaction although I did not
really know him. He was the man
who always remembered to thank
the cook at receptions. He was
the man whoseface lit up as he
saw a former student pushing a
baby carriage on Ellsworth Ave.

And he was the man who had
assumed inﬁnite responsibilities
at a point in life when he richly
deserved‘ a life of his own.

a

That morning I was prepared L

«for a warm and kind being-—and .
yet .a man of istren_gth.iHe_nevber-
'.‘.“5?.PP9i’1?ed. me ‘c1arin;e.f.-these; 

It was not the ﬁrst time I had
been in that office. Yet as he
guided me around the immense
paneled room with its cathedral
ceiling, I was struck by its gran-
deur. Despite its size,-the room
was warm with logs blazing in
the ﬁre place.

He told me how Chancellor
Bowman had refused ttrhave the
‘office decorated‘ until the faculty
office had been plastered. Only
once when the Chancellor went
on a ﬁshing trip, Dr.- Crawford
recalled, were huilding and

‘ grounds people able to ﬁnish the

room.

Like a proud grandfather chat-
ting about a favored offspring,

he told me of the plans for a new

state relation which he had help-

’ ed master. Often he would crack

his crooked smile and warn me
that his next lcoment would be
better off the record.

Many people at the University
had asked me about the condi-
tion of an old family friend, but
as he asked about her there was
an enduring concern in his voice
and a true relief when he heard
she was improving,

It was at this point that I real-
ized that genuine decency of this
man uncluttered by the super-
ﬁciality affecting most of his
station.

Again at noon that ﬂag stared
me in the face an donce. more I
was reminded of the man now
gone. While I crossed Bigelow
girls thought out loud about the
fate of Friday’s rush parties.

One fellow asked his friend if
his car was full for a’ long ski
weekend they could now take.
Some self-consciously bubbled,
“Oh I'm so ‘happy there's no
classes. I know its terrible.”

The Agony, from the ‘view-

rit of the scriptwriter, is un-

voidable: the difficulty of pack-

ging commercially a Renais-

ance artist's creative sincerity

n the.big"ﬁlm, without distort-
ng "history.

Yet poor Philip Dunne has

anaged to alienate scholars of

uichaelangelo while attempting
o"use the art of the cinema to
reate a product which—in the
‘lords of its publicity releases—
joins the ranks of those few
lms that make the motion pic-
re the supreme entertainment
_1edium of the 20th century.”
‘ Notice it said “entertainment
edium,” not educational medi-
um.” The obvious aim of this
film was speciﬁcally that—enter-
tainment — and to shun The
gony ‘and the Ecstasy for its
pparent historical lapses would
be almost as heretical to show
business as classifying Gomer
Pyle as 2-S. _

_ In fact, for all the complaints,
the ﬁlm, now at the Squirrel Hill,
seems fairly accurate in depict-
“ngythe four years Michaelangelo
spent decorating the ceiling of
t e Sistine Chapel and struggling

fr his artistic sovereignty with
ope Julius 11.

.Where it lapses into complete
fantasy is ironically when direc-
1; Carol Reed makes full use of
the medium itself, thereby creat-
ing moments of purely 20th cen-
:tury spectacle. This is best seen
in the scene where Charlton Hes-

z...ton (Michaelangelo) is given his

The University has purchased
the 24,000 volume Andreana Col-
lection, doubling the library’s re-
sources of material in Spanish.
The culmination of several years
of negotiation, the collection was
brought for $100,000.

The collection, almost all of
which is in Spanish, represents

tion for_sch0lars specializing in

by Bill Jerome

inspiration for the now-immortal

1 Genesis ﬁgures through the move-

ment of man-shaped — and man-
made—c1ouds.

Yet for all its flaws, The Agony
and the Ecstasy shows rather
well the true creative mind at
work — isolated, proud, self-dis-
satisﬁed -— and the force of rea-
son opposing these traits, as’ em-

— bodide by Pope Julius II (Rex

Harrison). The interaction be-
tween these two well illustrates
the problems of commissioning
state art which still exist: money,
propriety of subject, time.

Another less obvious idea is
that of the status of artists —
should they remain individuals,
or should they stoop to live by
the “servant mentality” in order
to get patronage? The young
Raphael (Tomas Milian) fre-
quently scolds his former master
for not being “respectful” to-
wards Julius, while Michaelan-
gelo continues his brashness in
the name of better art.

This confrontation is ﬁnally
resolved with the completion of
the ceiling frescoes, as Michael-
angelo has withstood charges of
“nakedness” in his Biblical de-
piction, and Julius has success-
fully fought off the French and
Austrian armies that threatened
to dominate Rome. The artist has
learned that “I am not alone,”
and the Pope has become more
appreciative of the Sistine art.

A perfect story, and whether

“The Agony”

or not exhaustive in its accur-
acy, it is nonetheless entertain-
ing and even somewhat instruc-
tive in its constant depicting of
the empty ceiling to remind view-
ers of the quantity of work in-
volved in the painting of the
ceiling of the Chapel. I

The quality of .the work, how-
ever, seems to be lightly touch-
ed upon; it is as if anyone so
dedicated could have equalled
the skill and facility of Charlton
Heston — oops, Michaelangelo —
as he worked lying on his back
on a scaffold 70 feet in the air.
This failure to capture the sense
of genius seems to be the major
ﬂaw in attempting to -portray
the character of the 8.I'tlSl3.r

But judging by what else seems
to be popular at the moment, the
ﬁlm could truly have been a must
to avoid, if, Hollywood had real-
ly wanted to distort. Imagine:

University Acquires Andreana ICollection;
Doubles Library’s Resources In Spanish

tor for technical services of the
University Libraries. _
Gathered ‘over some 25 to 30
years by Dr. de Andrea, a Cana-
dian resident in Mexico with spe-
cial knowledge of the book trade,

the books are being sent by post_

from Mexico City. They will ar-
rive item by item during the next
six months. .

Many rare and valuable works
such as the collected poetry of
Sor Juana Ines and the Paris edi-
tions of the poetry of Ruben
Dario are included in the collec-
tion. A considerable number of
books are concerned with Mexi-
can revolutions, both factual and
ﬁctional. The collection also con-
tains a large selection Latin
America drama, as well as com-
plete literary periodicals.

Dr. Daily called it “unusual for
a library to get a collection like
this—especially one that is built
up by a bibliographer-publisher.”
He said, “It is a valuable one.
Not all the items are unique, but

even when they are not, they.

are usually better copies than the
ones that we already have.” In
such cases the best copy of the

book will be kept and the other

“swapped” with another library.

Dr. Daily considers the cost
“quite reasonable.” He comment-
ed that “we are lucky to get it at
that price.”

, “The Center for Latin Ameri-
can Studies has been given con-
siderable. help by this purchase,”
Dr. Daily said. He explained that
Spanish books are hard to buy.
They are usually published in 2,-
000 to 3,000 copies and/often go
out of print, ‘

The library's collection in Span-
ish to which these books will be
added will be mainly devoted to
works of social irnportance in

Latin America.

ures.

_ ‘Ever since Irish Democrats in New York
‘ posed President Lincoln’s _;compulsory
ilitary service measures prior to the Civil
ear, critics of the draft have been with us.
_ __ asically they are in two camps: One that
‘F "favors abolishment of any military conscrip- _
gtlon, the other favoring a truly compulsory
ystem without exception. Both groups de-
ry the inequalities of our present setup
I ich requires inductioneof less than 60
per cent of the eligible male youth under
 ge 26.

_ ’ PROPONETS of a strictly voluntary
armed forces claim: ‘

_ ,1. The draft is militarily ineffective be-
cause 97 per cent of the draftees leave after
their hitch is up. -

- 2. Adequate training cannot be provided
-during the time allotted for draftees.

 3. Today's modern warfare requires
fewer and more specialized soldiers.

 4. A more professional and adept mili-
tary force could be maintained by voluntary
_.ersonnel, attracted by higher salaries and
’ "nge beneﬁts.»

- 5. The draft removes useful youth from
the general employment market.

, /5 Ross Wilhelm, associate‘ professor of
"f business~administration at the University
of Michigan and strong advocate of the vol-

untary system, has suggested a $300 month-
ly across-the-board pay hike for all military
personnel—a program he says would cost
the government a_n extra $9 billion annually.
Reduction of government expenditures in
other areas would finance the raise, he
claims. ,

Recruits are presently paid $78 a month,
compared with West Germany’s $110 and
Canada’s $112. _

Opponents of the voluntary plan, how-
ever, say costs of_ the program would be
excessive and question the feasibility of
having professionals shoulder the sacriﬁces
and responsibilities for the entire nation.

    
  
  
  
  
   
     
  
  
   
   
 
    
  
  
   
    
  
    
   
  
  
    
   
   
  
   
   
     
  
   
  
  
 
 
  
  
   
    
    
    
   
   
    
  
  
   
         

THE SECOND plan—‘strictly compul-
sory conscription--—calls for an actual uni-
_versal draft which would eliminate the de-
ferments and rejections which have made
the present program unfair.

According to figures in U.S. News and
World Report, less than 60 per cent of
American males age 26 are serving or have
served their military obligation. About 30
per cent are rejected for physical, mental,
or moral reasons, and the other ten per cent
are deferred because of parenthood or other
causes. as
' A recent Gallup Poll indicated that 83 per
cent of the persons interviewed favored
some form of compulsory duty for rejected
draft-eligible males. A special program for
these youth, would, proponents claim, cut
unemployment,’ reduce juvenile delinquency
and encourage reenlistments.

Also, the compulsory program would
distribute ‘responsibility for national de-
fense more evenly. ' «

Both plans have merit—something the
present system is sadly lacking. If the
inequalities of our present draft laws are
to be eliminated, either military careers
must be made more attractive, or universal
conscription enforced.

Liberals Scream, But . . .

Fight Fire with Fire
By Alan Disler

-Members of the liberal community, ‘obsessed with the
self-appointed care of the nation’s morality, condemn with
shocked countenances almost all effective anti-Communist
measures. All firm stands and actions on the partof‘ this
country are met with cries of “If we ‘resort to their tactics,
aren’t we the same as they are?” is V

The correct reply, of course, is “No, starry-eyed ones
we are not.” ‘ , *

The liberals, should take a lesson from Herman Mel-
,vil1es’s Billy Budd, in which the forces of Absolute Good
and the forces of Absolute Evil clashed, with disastrous re-
sults for the Good. Now, to quell the cacophony of derisive
snickers and jeers which would otherwise emanate from the
Liberal Peanut Gallery, I’ do not by any stretch of the imag-
ination mean to say that this country represents Absolute
Good and the communist countries Absolute Evil. However,
I do believe that for all her faults, failures, and misguided
and misinformed ventures, this country is infinitely ‘superior
both morally and materially to that country ‘which, in the
words of ‘John Kennedy, “stamped its character for. all time
in the bloody streets of Budapest.” ‘ ' —

WE CANNOT expect to survive either the blatant ag-
gression of Red China or the subtle, and thus far more dan-
gerous ideological Warfare of the Soviet Union, guided by
rules which are fine for the normal day-to-day intercourse
between human beings, but which become fatally useless in
international relations. Again, a qualification is needed, lest
the Gallery protest. I do not suggest that the United States
engage in terrorism andnuclear blackmail to oppose Com.-
munism, but rather employ firm and dedicated action.

If this involves the maintenance of a secret agency

‘which is not betrayed by complete congressional scrutiny

and is technically extra-constitutional, then unfortunately
so it must be. If this involves checking the activities of the
American Communist party, with such unorthodox methods
as wire tapping, then this -is something which has to be
suffered for the general welfare of the nation. To argue
against these tactics would be similar to advocating pro-
tection against H-bombs with bullet-proof vests. It would
be as suicidal. We weren’t the first to usesuch methods, and
when the need. disappears, we will cease to employ them‘.
LIBERALS HAVEN’T heeded the advice of their ex-
head theoritician, John P. Roche, past national chairman of
the Americans for Democratic Action. In an article in the
New Leader, Roche said, “Fine liberals, who would storm

-Congress to aid a beleagured Israel, suddenly shift" gears

when Asia is involved and start talking about ‘the inevitabil-
ity of Chinese domination’ and the ‘immorality’ of bombing
North Vietnam . . . I am convinced that the absence of
liberal realism in the analysis of international relations has
a dangerous effect on international opinion. And on inter-
national stability.” . T '

Realism, then, is the key. Failure to face the world

‘realistically will lead to disaster. It is as simple asgthat. It .
_. is altogether, possible, that somedaysomeone will

by  St. John’s University, min-i
us of course their reknowned

head basketball coach Joe
Lapchick, but none the worse

as a hardcourt power, face
the Panthers tomorrow afternoon

. at the Field House. Game time

is 2 p.m /

The Redmen are one of the
strongest teams in the East, boast-
ing a 10-3 record. They have
beaten Syracuse and in their
last encounter they whipped St.
Joseph’s by 10 points.

Lapchick’s successor, Lou Car-
nesecca, has two of the ﬁnest
ballplayers in this part of the
country to uphold the winning
tradition.

Sonny Dove is one of them.
All he’s done is average 22 points

Phi Ep Defeats
Taller Delta Sigs
In “A” League

Two fraternity “A” league
powerhouses met Tuesday
night, and Phi Epsilon Pi
emerged with a narrow 41-39
victory over Delta Sigma Phi
and sole possession of first
place. “B” leader Sigma Alpha
Epsilon (3-0) was idle, but sec-
ond place Pi Kappa Alpha (3-1)
gained ground by topping Phi
Kappa Theta, 36-22.

Against bruising competition,
Phi Ep rallied from an 18-17
half-time- deﬁcit. Buddy Sapol
sky bucketed 17 for the winners
while Brian Jontow added 11.
Bob Longo and Vince Bartolata
scored 12 apiece for the losers.
The PiKA’s used their edge in
manpower for their victory al-
though the game’s high scorer
was Rich Erderlyi (11) of Phi
Kappa Theta.

In other games, Sigma Chi
couldn’t catch Pi Lambda Phi in
the fourth quarter, losing 31-28;
Zeta Beta Tau edged Theta Chi,
37-31; and Delta Tau Delta top-
pled Sigma Alpha Mu, 49-37.

The Phi Eps are now in ﬁrst
place in the “A” League. Delta
Sig who was previously unbeaten
had to forfeit their previous
games because Tom Roantree, a
former member of the varsity
team, played for them. SAE is in
ﬁrst place in the “B” League on
the basis of their strong rebound-

-_ ing.

    

DELTA SIGr‘S Bob Longo outbattles Phi Ep Buddy Sapolsky for re-

d   A I  A A

and 16 rebounds 2. game. The
6-7 junior is “deceptively strong,”
according to hoopster coach Bob
Timmons. “Dove plays inside
most of the time,” Timmons said.
“From there he’ll either Shoot 01'
drive to the basket.”

The Johnnies other top per-
former is captain Bob McIntyre.
A 6-6 forward, McIntyre has hit
for 20 points a game. “Either
one of these two players can

play the pivot,” noted Timmons.l

“They’re both strong and tough,
especially inside.”

In was the inside shooting that
hurt the hoopsters against West
Virginia last Tuesday night. Most
of the Mountaineer baskets came
from within five feet of the hoop.
Timmons fears the same prob-
lem will arise tomorrow.

“We’ll have to play the same
type of game that we’ve been

playing for the last week,” he
said. “That is, we. can’t match
basket for basket, so we’ll have
to try to set -the game tempo
ourselves.”

The Redmen play a man to
man defense which has proven
tougher for the Panthers to set
up against than the zone. Penn-
State used a zone that the hoops-
ters riddled. WVU played a man
for man that gave them trouble.

St. John’s and the Panthers
have had one common opponent.
Both clubs clobbered George
Washington, the Redmen 100-62
and the cagers 85-59. Whether or
not this means that Dove, Mc-
Intyre and company can be beat-
en will be determined tomorrow

The hoopster-St. J ohn’s clash
is Pkeceeded by the fresh return
battle with the Youngstown JV’s,
which starts at noon.

Steenlage Heads Army Attack

Wrestlers Forsee Trouble
In Away Meet with Cadets

By TOM SACKS, Assistant Sports Editor .

Navy sunk the wrestling team last week and tomorrow
it will be Army’s turn to see how much damage they can
inﬂict with their medium range weapons at West Point.

The cadet matmen have solid strength starting at the
130 pound division and running up to the 152 class. If the
wrestlers hope to salvage anything Saturday it will have to

be the upper weight divisions and
that was where they‘ were most
humiliated by Navy.

Randy Kahlor (177) and Jack
Williams (191)-‘were both pin-
ned last week. Coach Dave John-
son wasn’t surprised .at Williams
fate but he still hasn’t ﬁgured
out Kahlor.

“Wiliams iust hasn’t been try-
ing,” said Johnson. “I think he

had some type of cold last week. '

If he worked hard he’d be one
of the best in the East. Kahlor’s
just the opposite. I thought for
sure that he had the drive to win
and I can't account for his being

‘ pinned.”

Kahlor’s opponent tomorrow

will be a sophomore, Jim Harter, 

who won the Plebe wrestling
tournament last year. Wililams
will most likely face one of
Army's six lettermen, Jerry
Huyck.

Another of their lettermen who
also happened to win the 130
pound title in the Easterns last
year is Bob Steenlage. Steenlage
most likely won’t be seeing that

bound in fraternity‘ “A” league competition. Phi IL}: won, 41-39, with
Sapolsky scoring 18,

much action tomorrow" because
his opponent is Tony Liberati,
who has been having more than
the normal amount of trouble
winning the last two years at
123 pounds.

Moving Liberati out of his fa-
miliar slot for the ﬁrst time this
year "~_j.is sophomore Dick Shildt.
Having started out the season at
137 which is way out of his
weight class, Shildt has been
aiming for the 123 berth ever
since. Johnson is now conﬁdent
that he has the stamina to han-
dle the position.

Ron Schuchert will also have
his hands full at 137 pounds with
Cadet Bob Robbins. Last year,
Robbins placed sixth in the
NCAA tournament. ‘ »

Dino Boni (145), who was the
only winner last week at Navy,
might have his troubles tomor-
row if his oponent is Mark Scure-
man. Sidelined at the beginning
of the season with a knee in-
jury, Scureman was expected to
return to action either late this
month or in early February.

“Scureman’s a tough wrestler.
Boni won"t_ have an easy time if
he is back in shape,” said John-
son. , V

Jerry Rhone, who normally
wrestles at 152, won’t be making
the trip tomorrow because of an
injured back. Clair Riley has
moved down 160 to ﬁll in.

Gymnasts Lose to Lions;
Host Kent State Tomorrow

The gymnasts of Kent State will play opposite a top
basketball attraction at Trees Hall gymnasium Saturday at
2 :00. St. Johns will be in the Fitzgerald Field House playing

the hoopsters.

The nation’s -number one gymnastics team didn't look
too impressive as they defeated a much weaker Panther

team, 164.85-145.50. Last year,’
Penn State was the national
champs and this year they are
supposed to have an excellent
chance to retain their crown.

Penn State, coming off a nar-
rrow 5/100 of apoint victory
over Springﬁeld, beat Pitt des-
pite the lack of their top all-
around man and poor perform-
ances by two of the countries
top gymnasts. “They’d have real-
ly swamped us if they’d have
used Cohen,” said Pitt coach War-
ren Neiger. Steve Cohen, who
normally participates in six or
seven, events, could have scored
much_ higher than his less able
substitutes.

Dave Paoletti, one of the na-
tion’s top side horse specialists,

had a disappointing perform- .

ance, scoring 8.3 out of a possible
10 points. Dave. MeKinnis of Pitt
defeated Paoletti, with a score
of 8.65, for Pitt’s only ﬁrst place
of the meet. Jim Isabelle of Penn
State, even with taking three
ﬁrst’s, scored much lower than
‘his average.

PANTHER GLUE

All varsity athletes interest-
ed in joining the Panther Club
should report to Trees Hall
Tuesday, Feb. 1, at 4 p.m. Tim
Grgurich is in charge and all
those who come should be pre-
pared to elect officers.

Pitt was also. hampered by the
injury of Dave Shidemantle.

Shidemantle, ‘a strong performer .

on the parallel bars and ﬂoor
exercise, has been sidelined with
an elbow injury and participated
only on the trampoline, scoring
a below average 6.65.

Bob Laurenzeno of Pitt had his
troubles on the side horse, fall-
ing off the horse twice during
his routine. Because of this, Lau-
rezano scored only 3.00 out of 10.

Overall, Pitt’s performance was
not impressive, as throughout the
rest of the meet Pitt took only
two second placw.

Seek Third Straight Win

Miami of Ohio Visits Trees Pool

To Take — On Streaking Swiers

By GEORGE LIES
The second visitor of the week from Ohio, Miami Uni-
versity, challenges the swimming team tomorrow at Trees
Hall Pool at 2:00 p.m. And if coach Ben Grady wants his
guestto return again, he should treat him a little bit better

than the last one.

Kent State was the ﬁrst visitor to Trees last Wednes-

day, but coach Grady’s mermen
did more than show them around
the place. While Kent admired
the pool, the swimmers walked
away with everything they own-
ed. The tour resulted in a 67-28
victory and a 2-3 record for the
swimming team.

Nine first place ﬁnishes com-
pared to two for Kent is what
made it possible for the mermen.
In some of the events, Grady did

I not use his best swimmer. “Since
I didn’t know very much about
Kent’s team, I had to wait; feel
my way through the meet,” he
said.

One of the events in which
Grady did use his best swimmer
was the 200-yard breastroke. In
that event, sophomore Jack Volz
pushed himself to a new school
record with a time of 2223.5.
Voltz’ time surpassed the 1962
mark of Dennis McHugh by 8.3
seconds, but lags behind the
Trees Pool record of 2:22.4 set

"by Maryland’s Wayne Pow1ow-
ski. ‘

After Don Hahnfeldt picked
up his fourth high board diving

win in -ﬁve meets, the swimmers
led at the halfway point, 35-17.
He outpointed Kent’s Lee Schwart
zenberg, 24Q-184, by scoring be-
tween 38 and 50 points on his
last ﬁve dives.

“When Kent’s coach (Bill Hoov-
er) saw his team was behind by
a big lead, he saved some of his
swimmers because they meet
Carnegie Tech this week and he
didn’t want anyone to scout his
boys,” Grady said.

Of the nine ﬁrsts, sprint free-
styler Andy James earned two
in the 50 and the 100-yard events.
In the 100, co-captain Tom _Ribar-
chak almost caught his team-
mate, ﬁnishing second to James’
time of :51.6. The Trees record
is 248.5, held by Maryland’s Phil
Denkevitz. .

James’ small ﬁnger on his
right hand is still crooked, bent
at right angles to his hand. “It
doesn't bother me, but I have to
make adjustments in my stroke,”
James said. “It will be operated
on after the season.”
