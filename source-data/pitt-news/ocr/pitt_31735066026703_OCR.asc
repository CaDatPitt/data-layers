As part of their celebration
of Black History Month, the
Black Action Society spon-
sored a Black History
Extravaganza last night in the
William Pitt Union.

About 25 people gathered to
view art, listen to poetry read-
ings and hear a lecture by
keynote speaker Yevette
Richards, assistant professor
of Africana Studies at Pitt.

The program opened with
the performance of Libations,
aritual which pays homage to
those who’ve gone before us.
In Libations, people shout out
the names of deceased people
they were close to or whom
they respect in an attempt to
bring the spirit of those people
to the room.

African drummer George
Jones dressed in native garb
and performed a song which is
a welcome dance in Liberia.
Several students and guests
performed poetry they wrote
that had special meaning for
them. Paintings by artist

BAS extravaganza hel Union Weekend

snare four

By Mark Gordon
Asst. News Editor

A chair was thrown through a
window at Hillman Library, a
Pitt employee was arrested 10
miles from campus with stolen
property and a drug deal took
place in front of a campus police
officer.

Besides that, it was an average
weekend for the Department of
Public Safety. V

Saturday, around 4:30 p.m.,
Pitt student Jason Graves-
Funderburg allegedly threw a
chair through a window in
Room 387 at the Hillman
Library.

According to Public Safety,
the student was studying with
two individuals and he asked
what time it was. When the stu-
dents did not reply, Graves-
Funderburg, 18, threw a chair
through a window, shattering
the glass.

Pitt police found the student

Calvin Reynolds were on dis-
play in the Ballroom for view-
ing following the presentation.

Richards spoke on the
importance of black history in
her keynote address. Richards
quoted to the audience from
“Proud Virginia History,” the
fourth grade text book she was
taught from as a child.
Richards read passages of the
book which distorted historical
events and which Richards
said taught her, “... that blacks
were degraded and hadn’t

done anything important in
history.”
Richards cited the text-
book’s inaccurate description
of the landing of the ﬁrst ship
of slaves at Jamestown. The
book said that “all but 20” of
the slaves died on the way, but
it never speculates on the hun-
dreds of slaves who died in the
journey. The book said that in
many ways slavery was harsh-
ly cruel. “But it didn’t mention
the ways — the separation of
families, the backbreaking

work, the neglect of the health
of slaves and the general

despair slaves felt,” Richards

said.

Richards emphasized the
importance of developing pos-
itive black role models for

today’s children. It might not .

be good to promote all blacks
who make money as role mod-
els for society, Richards said.
“Role models aretparents

dren right and teachers who do

in Chevron Hall, and he was
charged with institutional van-
dalism and intimidation of_ a wit-
ness. .

The second charge involved a
confrontation between Graves-
Funderburg and the witness who
reported the incident

_ According to Director of
Public Safety Rick Boyd,
Graves—Funderburg told the wit-
ness, “If you testify, you will
pay. You better find a big
friend.”

For The Pitt News

As an artist who once could not attend a
university, Ruth Richardson is very happy to

have some of her works displayed in the .

University of Pittsburgh’s faculty and staff
lounge. ,

“I have a lot to paint about because of my
life experiences,” Richardson said. “I like to
express things symbolically and use color to
interpret my feelings and impressions of
places I visit and people I meet”

Richardson’s work is among that of 21
artists’ which make up the new Pitt Club
Collection. ’

The collection was chosen from a diverse

selection to represent the art and artists of .

Westem.Pennsylvania, and Richardson’s
works were chosen after appearing at the
Images exhibition at the art gallery in the
Vlfrlliam Pitt Union.

Having been interested in art at an early
age, Richardson received a national art
scholarship in high school but could not
attend art school at Washington University
because she is an African American.

She ended up attending St. Louis
University and majored in social work
because she could not study art.

«“St. Louis opened their doors ﬁrst, but art '

wasn’t one of their majors,” Richardson said.

Attending St. Louis was still difficult,
Richardson said, because she was one of
only ﬁve African-American students admit-
ted.

“You were accepted into school but isolat-
ed,” Richardson said. “Nobody did anything
wrong to you. You just weren’t there.”

But Richardson’s time there was not all
bad. She recalls a ﬁeld trip when all the other
students on the bus refused to stop at restau-
rants where Ruth could not eat too, and
another time when some white students
brought her books and homework when she
was sick.

“You have experiences like that that kept
you going,” she said.

When Washington University eventually
opened to African Americans, Richardson
could not attend the school of fine arts
because the only graduate school open to
African Americans was social work.

She continued to paint while obtaining her

  Pitt art exhibit spotlights local artist's work

master’s degree and worked with underprivi-
leged youths to help them see that they could
also overcome obstacles. '

“I wanted to deal with kids that other peo-
ple rejected,” Richardson said. “We tried to
make each kid seem important in spite of
their diﬁiculties.”

Richardson founded and was the first
director of Three Rivers Youth Organization
and is presently working to start a communi-
ty art school in the South Hills.

“[The school] is a combination of pretty
much all my life experiences,” Richardson
said.

Her work with children is among what
Richardson believes to be her greatest
accomplishments, and she does not regret
having to study social work instead of art.

0'

“All the role models in my life were in the '

position of helping people, and I believe that
if you can’t get what you want, then you
should do something that will bring you
closer to your goal,” Richardson said.
She is also proud of the fact of having
endured as an artist after so many obstacles.
“I used to think I wasn’t good enough if I

Donate your time

When most people think of donating to charity, they think of
writing out a check or dropping a few coins into someone’s can
as he accosts you on a street comer. Yet, giving to a worthy
cause can be fun andrewarding beyond the mere satisfaction of
having sent what you can spare to your cause of choice.

Within the near future, there are two events with which Pitt
students should consider taking time to get involved. This way,
they can become involved in making their community a better
place.

The first is the University of Pittsburgh Dance Marathon. The
proceeds from this event go towards /Family House. This is an
organization that allows relatives to stay free of charge while
their relatives are in one of the Medical Center’s hospitals. It is a
worthy cause and a way to spend a night out.

Registration for the Dance Marathon will be held on
Thursday, Feb. 23, -in the William Pitt Union Dining Room. All
campus organizations should try to have a representative at the
marathon. It is not strictly a Greek event, and the best way to
show this is with a high turn out from all sectors of the campus
community.

The second event is the Hand In Hand Festival, which is
designed to stage a carnival for handicapped kids. Students are
needed to be One-on-One volunteers, clowns and facilitators.
Groups are also needed to sponsor booths at the event.

Incompetence abounds  

Colin Ferguson now says, with his conviction by a jury, that
he was incompetent to stand trial. He feels this is sufficient
grounds for him to appeal his conviction.

At the beginning of this debacle, Ferguson not only insisted
that he was mentally fit to stand trial, but that he'was able to be
his own legal counsel. So competent was he that he dismissed
Ronald Kuby and William Kunstler as his defense lawyers.

He was convicted of killing six passengers and injuring 19
other on the Long Island Railroad.

Ferguson tried to subpoena everyone from Newt Gingrich to
President Clinton, and yet the trial continued. When Ferguson
made these motions, no one attempted to rule that he was incom-
petent to stand trial. _

There is nothing to gain by allowing Ferguson to appeal on
these grounds. All that will happen is another trial full of out-
landish accusations and attempts to attribute Ferguson’s actions
to anyone but himself. On second thought, there is another con-
sequence to all of this. Ferguson’s case will tie_ up the court’s
time and money which could be put to better use prosecuting
other violent offenders of Ferguson’s ilk.

Lawyer Alton Rose, who served as Ferguson’s legal advisor
during the trial, was quoted in USA Today as saying “He always
insisted to me ..., that he was in complete control. I am very sur-
prised that they would raise the question of competence.”

Rose is not the only one who should be surprised.

Truth must be told

I am writing in response to the
letter -to the editor entitled
“Sexual assault victim exploited”
which ran in The Pitt News. I
must agree with Ms. Koch Ruiz
that to an extent the article by
Mark Gordon may have been too
graphic for some readers.
Heaven forbid that they tell the
truth about the incident

Let’s look at the facts of the
case.... The “victim” was intoxi-
cated and did leave the bar with a
man that she had just met that
evening. Those are the words

from Ms. Koch Ruiz and an
investigating ofﬁcer...She failed
to mention that the “victim” was
underage and that she had the
opportunity to leave the man’s
apartment after the_ﬁrst time he
tried to assault her. Makes a per-
son wonder what the “victim’s”
intentions were for that night.
I’m not trying to blame the
young woman. It is obvious that
Ms. Koch Ruiz has another
agenda other than protecting the
“victim” from further abuse. She
is just one of the people in our
society who will go to any
means to further their cause.
They are the self-righteous, over-
zealous, penis-hating, gender
bigots that will use a case like
this because it is considered
politically correct to do so.

If Ms. Koch Ruiz wants to
truly make a change around the
campus community, maybe she
could start by acting more
responsibly in her actions and
words. It is talk like her that
could be more devastating to the
“victim” than Mr. Gordon’s.

LETTERS TO, THE EDITOR

Police should patrol

Last week in the early
afternoon my friend was
assaulted behind Trees Hall
after leaving an aerobics
class. The "purpose of my
writing is not to alerf the
university community to
yet another unreported
assault, but something I
feel to be a more serious
issue.

The assault ‘occurred
while a campus police offi-
cer sat only a few hundred
feet away at a desk, reading
a newspaper, drinking
coffee and checking student
IDs. While I feel it
is important to make
sure only Pitt students
enter Trees Hall, I do not
feel that the campus police
are required to do such a
task. Many facilities at
this university require stu-
dents to show IDs upon
entrance, but students show
these IDs to work study,
student employees or peo-
ple from the security
agency who are hired for
the purpose of checking
students in and out of dor-
mitories.

The campus police are
clearly overqualified to be
desk attendants, and the
university is being denied
the service of the police
offer. While the assault
wasn’t prevented, maybe if
the Campus Police patrol
the area and-a student
checks IDs, future assaults
can be prevented.

Shared responsibility

I read with frustration Mary
K‘och Ruiz’s letter to the edi-
tor concerning Mark Gordon’s
article about a recent assault.
Certainly some of her points
are valid and unarguable. My
concern is with the end of the
letter. It is an idea implied or
openly stated in a high
percentage of articles, books
and TV programs by and
about women: that in a situa-
tion that turns out negative for
the woman, the woman is
somehow never in any way
responsible for that outcome.
She is always the totally inno-
cent victim. Never the co-
conspirator. It is always soci-
ety’s fault, always a man’s
fault or, at the least, always
just bad luck. Even from a
logical or common sense per-
spective, this is nonsense. But
it is more than that in this
incident.

Certainly, no behavior byia
woman justifies sexual
assault. But to say that the
article degraded this woman
without pointinglout that her
behavior prior to the incident
was self-degrading and that it
was directly responsible for
her even being in that situa-
tion in the first place is both
cowardly and hypocritical.
Women, you can’t take
responsibility for what hap-
pens positively to you if you
don’t also take occasional
responsibility for what nega-
tively happens to you. And in
this incident, there was
enough blame for both.

"Sports

'tt athlet-
ics have
been‘ said '

to be on the
downslide in
recent years.
That’s because
the revenue
sports, namely
basketball and
football, are in
rebuilding
stages. And often rebuilding
years are accompanied with loss-
es by the bulk.

But believe it or not, there’s a
team on campus that has monop-
olized Big East competition for
more than a decade — the men’s
swirmning and diving team.

This team is Pitt’s best-kept
secret. The volleyball team’s
seven straight conference crowns
comes in a close second, but
nothing compares to the men’s
swimming and diving accom-‘
plishments.

The swimmers and divers have
held the Big East title for 11 out
of the last 12 years. The only
time they lost was when they
were upset by Vrllanova two
Years 380- .

Wnniing 11 of 12 years is quite
a feat, but no one seems to know
about it. Why? Because it’s not a
revenue sport, and barely anyone
pays attention to non-revenue
sports.

“I think sometimes the guys
feel they don't get enough pub-
licity,” head swimming coach
Chuck Knoles said.

The swim and dive team is
rolling once again with a 10-3
record heading into the Big East
Championships this weekend
here at Trees Pool.

And according to Knoles, his
team is stronger than last year’s
and has a strong shot at maintain-
ing its dominance.

' The Championships start this
Friday with preliminaries and
end with the ﬁnals on Sunday.

Not only does the swim team
hold a vice-grip on the neighbor-
ing competition, but it’s also the
smartest team on campus.
Thirteen team members were
honored last Monday at the third
annual Scholar Athlete Honors
Luncheon. To be honored, a stu-
dent-athlete most hold a 3.0 GPA
over the past two semesters.

The team was also awarded
with having the highest GPA as
a team collectively — 2.87.

The 2.87 just edged out the
women’s gymnastics team with a
2.85.

Sparked by five players ‘in

Panthers defeated Big East foe
Providence 76-72 Sunday
afternoon at Alumni Hall in
Providence.
. “Any

players to
score in

you're going to win,” said
head coach Kirk Bruce.

The Lady Panthers were led
once again by shooting guard
Stephanie Petho. Petho scored
20 points while collecting nine
rebounds. Center Latia
Howard scored 17 points and
collected nine boards. Tressa
Bolfert netted 11 points, while
Jenine Joyce and Carol
Morton each scored 10 points.
Morton also contributed 10
assists.

“This was our best overall
performance in a while,”
Bruce said.

The first half started with
Providence opening up a 4-0
lead, but the Lady Panthers
responded with a 17-0 run
over the-next six minutes and
never trailed again.

Men '5 gym ed es JMU,

finishes behin Temple

By Brad Isles
Staff Writer

The men’s gymnastics team
held its first home meet of the
season last Saturday and fin-
ished second, scoring 215.95.
Temple finished first at
222.85, and James Madison
was third with 211.15.

“Overall, we looked real
c1ean,” said coach Frank
D’Amico. “The judging was
very difficult on a couple of
events where we did very
good routines, but it was also
hard on the opponents. They
were much better.”

Temple was just too much
for the Panthers to handle, as
the Owls swept all six events.

Pitt had their best perfor-
mances on floor with a 37.3,
but it was not enough to catch
Temple, which scored a 37.75.
Freshman Andy Anderson
started it off for the Panthers
with a 9.45. He was followed
by Brian Narvaez, who also
added a 9.45. Karl Chan and
Scott Carslaw finished both
finished with 9.2.

“I think we have a lot of
potential,” Carslaw said. “The
only way we can go is up.”

The Panthers also scored
well on high bar, finishing
with 36.55. Chan tied for fifth
with a 9.30. Jason Lannie
added a 9.15, Chris Sweeten
had 9.10 and Mike Maurer
scored a 9.0. Temple soared to

a 37.70.

“Their team is very strong
this year,” said D’Amico of
Temple’s performers.
‘‘They’ve got a ton of
seniors.” ‘ '

Keith Youndtwas solid once
again for Pitt, as he led the
Panthers with a 9.2 on pom-
mel horse and 9.0 on vault. He
also scored a career-high 9.65
on rings. However, that was
only enough to finish tied for
second with Temple’s Danny
Ackerman and Christian Colli.
They were outdone by another
Owl, Dave Frank (9.8).

Ackerman finished first in
the all-around with 56.55. He
was followed by JMU’s Chris
Golden (54.55), and Lannie,
Pitt’s ace all-arounder, was
third with 54.35.

Lannie also led the Panthers
with 9.1 on parallel bars.

D’Amico said he is pleased
with the progress his team is
making, especially the
younger performers. He is
also happy with the way the
upperclassmen are holding
together.

“I think if we can continue
along the same path, if we can
increase the difficulty just a
little bit, I think we can be
extremely competitive in
those two championship meets
(ECACs and North Atlantic
Championships),” D’Amico
said. “That’s what I’m trying
to peak the team for.” "

A 13-5 run gave the Lady
Panthers their largest lead of
the gameat 49-33 with 16:29

remaining in the contest.

Things did get scary for Pitt,
however. With 8:20 remaining
and the Lady Panthers up 66-
56, Providence went on. a 14-4
run over the next 5:56 to knot
the score at 70-70.

Petho, however, scored on a
lay-up and then converted two
foul shots to put Pitt up for
good 74-70.

The win raised Pitt’s record
to 14-10 (8-8 Big East). It also
stopped a two-game losing
streak and earned the team a
tie for fifth place in the confer-
ence.

“We needed that win,”
Bruce said, “But we need to
win the next two, and we
might have a chance at the
fourth seed in the Big East
toumament.”

The Lady Panthers have the
luxury of playing their final
two games in the friendly con-
fines of Fitzgerald Field House
where they’ve lost only three
games this season — two of
which were against national
powerhouses Connecticut, and
Penn State.

This Wednesday, the Lady ‘

Panthers play host to Syracuse,
which they defeated 75-63
on Dec. 7. The regular
season finale will be Feb. 25
against Villanova. The
Wildcats defeated Pitt 63-62
Jan. 21.» .

Women's gym cruises
post depleted c|UP squad

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staﬂ" Writer

It was easy going for the Pitt
women’s gymnastics team on
Saturday, as the pressure of a

‘hard-fought competition was lift-
ed from the team’s shoulders
before the meet even began.

’ Indiana University of
Pennsylvania came to town with
only two gynmasts in the compe-
tition because some team mem-
bers had been caught breaking
team rules and were suspended
from this meet by the IUP coach-
ing staff. .

The Lady Panthers suffered no
letdowns on the day and scored
184.45, their second—highest team
score this season. For the record,
IUP’s tandem scored 55.225.

Pitt swept the all-around com-
petition, with Brenda Stevens
(37.55) taking the top spot. Lori
Buck (35.80) and Robyn Senior
(35.60) took second and third
respectively.

“I’m real excited,” Pitt head
coach Debbie Yohman said. “It
was a nice meet for us.
Unfortunately, it wasn’t much
competition, but the competition
was ourselves, and we rose to the
occasion.” '

On the vault, Mikie Myers led
the way with a score of 9.45. Next
for Pitt was a trio of gymnasts
with scores of 9.05. Belonging to
this group were Christine Battista,
Robyn Senior and Michelle Cole.

- This meet was the ﬁrst action of

the year for Cole, who has-been
suffering from back problems.
Pitt’s next event was the uneven
bars. Stevens (9.575) won the
event, and Kristin Bond placed
second with a career-high (9.350).
The best event of the night for

the Lady Panthers was the balance ‘

beam. Myers (9.60) was good
enough to win the event. This was
also her season-high score on the
beam. Stevens (9.55) ﬁnished sec-
ond. Deena Daller (9.425) and
Buck’s career-high performance
of 9.475 helped Pitt to their sea-
son-high score on the beam.

Pitt was led on the ﬂoor exer-
cise by an outstanding perfor-
mance from Senior that scored
9.675, her career-high on the ﬂoor.
Stevens (9.425), Calli Bodnar
(9.325) and Joy McElhinny (9.25)
backed up Senior’s leading scone.

“Robyn did not have a good
meet,” Yohman said, “but she sure
did have a good ﬂoor. She ﬁn-
ished up strong and got a good
score.”

Pitt now heads into the second
half of the season that will con-
clude with the East Coast Athletic
Conference Charnpionships on
March 24 at the Fitzgerald Field
House.

“Right now we are where we
should be at this point of the sea-
son,” Yohman said “We still lack
a little confidence and difﬁculty
that we can add before the end
of the season. We still have time
in the gym to work on new
tricks.”

Drugs

°From page 1

Public Safety also made two
drug arrests and a theft arrest
over the long weekend.

The first one was made
Saturday night around 9 p.m.
Anthony Barg from
Philadelphia and David Brim
from Langhorne, Pa., were

- arrested for delivering a con-

trolled substance, possession of
marijuana and possession of
psilocybin, a hallucinogen. The
pair was spotted by a Public
Safety officer while exchanging
money and “baggies” with
drugs, according to Public
Safety. The two suspects are not
Pitt students.

In Lothrop Hall, around 10
p.m., there was another drug
arrest. Richard Buck was seen
by a Pitt student trying to break
into rooms in Lothrop during a
ﬁre alarm. Public Safety officers
searched for the suspect and
found him in a room that,
according to Boyd, contained
“marijuana in plain view, a glass
bong, two baggies, a gold pipe,
a wood storage box, an envelope
with $200 in it and marijuana on
the top of the bag and wet tissue
paper with seeds.” ‘

While police were at the
scene, Pitt student Joshua Wells,
who lives in the room, returned.

Wells and Buck were charged
with possession of marijuana
with an intent to deliver and cul-
tivation.

Public Safety officers also
arrested Jay Balaski of Ross
Township for theft and receiving
stolen property. Ofﬁcers found a
television set and a vacuum
cleaner that was reported stolen
from Pitt residence halls.
Balaski is an employee in the
housing department.
