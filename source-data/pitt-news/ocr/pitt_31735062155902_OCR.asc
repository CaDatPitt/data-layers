‘Hail To Pitts’ To Get
  Modern Facelifting

Smoke control is being strictly enforced at Pitt where t
. efforts are underway to remove the words “Smoky Town”
from the university pep song,.

.“Hail to Pitt.”

Not wishing to fall out of favor with the Chamber of Com-
merce, the Student Congress public relations committee is

sponsoring a contest which should¢
produce new words for the song
--that is if Pittites are interested
in winning either a Pitt Blazer
or a Pitt Chair on exhibit at the
student desk_ ,

Emil Herman, SC public rela-
tions chairman, has announced
that the contest- is not limited to
_students,. but is open to faculty

alumni as well.

Anentrant should write his re-
vision of the first four lines, com-
pletely deleting such words as
smoke, smog, fog, or haze. The
committee has_ obtained permis-
sion from the lyricist George Kirk
and the publishing company to
make thechanges. However, it,is
preferable .that the‘ least number

of changes be made.

All entries should have the con-
testant’s name, address and status
at the University, and should be-
submitted either at the SC office,
830 C1 or at the Student Desk.

Entries will be judged by se-
lectedfaculty members, SC pub-
lic relations chairman, the presi-
dents of _the Glee Club and Wom-
en’s Chorale, and Mr. '-Kirk.

A The present words for the ﬁrst
four lines which contain the long
out—'dated phraseology are:

“Down in Smokeytown in

Pennsylvania, '

In Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh

We have a ’University we’re

all proud of '

Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh.”

so Sets Cheerleader

Plans in ‘Long Session

_ ,_ By mv ROTHMANV A _ ,
Student Congress this week put into effect the women

cheerleader‘ program; In the

most enthuisastic discussion

of the year that brought to‘ thevfloor at least ﬁve different
motions and amendments to perfect a special proposal, SC
sent the cheerleader plan’ to Pitt Pistols for immediate try-
outs for interested “students, male or female.

. Sam Granowit-z, Senior repre-
sentative, made the motion which
transformed the cheerleader issue
from paper to actual practice. The
ﬁnal motion read,’ “that SC recom-
mend that Pitt'Pistols call for try-
outs for a cheerleading group; this
group to- con"sist"of the most_ca-
pable persons whether female or
male or’ 'a combination thereof.”

Paul Petro, Women Cheerleader
chairman and Ada Joseph‘, SC
Secretary, said that the plan has
received the wholehearted appro-
val of Capt. Tom Hamilton, di-
rector ofathletics. Capt_ Hamil-
ton has said the athletic depart-
ment will furnish ﬁnancialaid,
uniforms, Qoachingand transporta-

ﬁrst meeting of the Pitt Pistols
to choose cheerleaders, for the
coming football season.

However," SC received unex-
pected oposition from Dean Bid-
dle who argued that the present
cheerleader _proposal was out of

. the 'jurisdiction of that group.
He said, “I'm concerned that-
your enthusiasm for something
may take you out of your im-
mediate bounds of action.”

In spite of statements that at-

action‘ by the athletic department,
Biddle stated, “Cheerleading is
the responsibility of the athletic
He suggested that

the athletic department ask Pitt
Pistols to assume women cheer-
leaders, as they-.’.ve handled male
cheerleaders in the past. .
Ada Joseph opposed Biddle’s
stand by referring ‘to the current
run-around SC has been receiving

on the much wanted proposal: ‘

“We have gone through the‘ chan-

'nels recommended to us, but the”

advice giver! us has been con-
fusing. and non-commital. We got

off on a tangent earlier because

we lacked advisorship.” She con-
tinued, “We have had‘ a conference
with Capt_ Hamilton and he told
‘us to .work along with Pitt Pis-
tols.”

"Biddle also questioned‘ Congress’
right to express the women’s op-
inion, saying, “It is‘ my opinion
that WSGA is more qualiﬁed to
speak for women than any other
organization.” He was referring
to-the recent WSGA vote which
downed the ‘cheerleader proposal

' 14-12, with four abstaining.

Sam Granowitz replied, ..“the
athletic department would want
students, as represented by SC,
to express their views and help i
work out solutions.” ‘

In other important business, SC
appointed Paul Schrading, recently
chairman of Religion - in - Life
Week, to head an evaluation com-
mittee for the Pitt Chest.

‘Intense Activity’ of City
Cited by Dean Larson

By NANCY JONES

One of the outstanding ﬁgures
and ﬁnest scholars in the legal
profession is Pitt’s Prof. Arthur
Larson, dean of the Law School,
who came to the University last
June from Cornell where he taught
law for eight years.

I
Hisﬁrst impression of Pittsburgh ; f
was that of “intense activity.” f‘
“The whole community is in the. E.

mood for backing any constructive
project put forward.” That is the
mood in which Prof. Larson hopes
to keep Pitt’s Law School.

Prof. Larson is a native of

Sioux Falls, S. D., where he

spent his college days and. at-

tended law school. Early in his

career, he was sent to Oxford

University, England, as a Rhodes

scholar. '1‘here he received his

law degree and graduated ﬁrst_
in the class. ’

Back in America he settled down
to practice law for a while in Mil-

hlwaukee. Here may be where he
ﬁrst? became absorbed in corpora-

tion law and social legislation, the
dean hinted. "
WaryPosts

Just before World War II, Lar-

son was assistant professor of law

at the University of Tennessee.

However, during the war years he

-worked in Washington, ﬁrst with

the OPA putting maximum prices
on lumber and then as Chief of

l the Scandinavian Section of the

Foreign Economic Administration.

A In this job, he planned the war-
time‘ commerce of countries like

Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and
Iceland.

“Public service” is very import-
ant, he emphasized. Proof of that
is the model housing code ordi-

ally presented to Mayor David L.

_ Lawrence just a few weeks ago.

Mayor Lawrence said it would lay
the foundation for slum clearance
in the Pittsburgh" area. Dean Lar-
son waslvery proud of it and of
Pitt’s’ Law School Research Bu-
reau which did most of the work
on compiling the Pittsburgh health
laws and requirements for the or-
dinance. ' '
Health Laws Published

This project was a subdivision of
the main public health project of
the research buregu. They have
gathered and published in an enor-
mous book all the public health
laws of Pittsburgh. .

It is the ﬁrst time this great task i

has been done. “Before, Pitts-
burgh’s health laws were scattered
and nobody knew them all,” he

Men Debaters Receive Awards“

In Oratory and Speech Feats

By ED FRANK

Despite two tournament losses
on foreign campuses, Pitt’s Men_’s
Debate team did not return with-
out their share of glory when two
members of the- team brought
home individual honors in gruel-
ing weekend series.

‘Harvey Kelman and Dan Purdy
received second place awards in
o r a t o r y and extemporaneous.
speaking "contests respectively at
the Pennsylvania State Debate
Tournament held at Meadville.

Ke1man’s underplayed speech on
religious discrimination climaxed
with a thundering “Heil Hitler”
won wide acclaim by the audience
and judges. Purdy talked strictly
oﬂ.’ the cuﬁ on why the Ta£t—Hart-
ley Act should not be amended to

. orators

the satisfaction of labor unions.

Although the team was defeated
by Temple University in semi-
ﬁnals they were rated third in the
tourney by the judges. Their ten
game record for the series was
marked by only one other team
loss. '

Awarding of the championship
cup climaxed the .
Won by the Pitt team last year, it
went to the Temple team this time.

Last Friday, Pitt debaters, rep-
resented by Joe Trattner and Dan
Levitt, were out-thundered in a

Pitt News Service Feature . . .

- By Irv Rothman.

Ina desperate attempt to in-
crease student interest in Men’s
Council, MC has completely re-

vamped its constitution for more
r'c—presentation‘from each class in
the various schools of the Univer-
sity.

At a m'eeting Thursday night,
representatives voted to increase
council membership to thirty per-
sons. The presidents- of the senior,
junior, sophomore and freshman
classes from the College, School of
Business Administration, Engi-
neering and Mines, Pharmacy and
Education would automatically be-
come delegates of their class to
MC. Because Education has only
the senior and junior classes, they
would be limited to two delegates,

H making a total of 18 presidents who

would serve on the council.

To satisfy the request for pro-
portionate representation of the
schools, the other twelve represen-

-tatives would be elected as mem-

bers—at-large. The exact, number

for each school will be determined

by fall registration ﬁgures.‘ Prefer-
ence for these positions will be
given ﬁrst to the upper classmen.
For any additional delegates which
the school merits, a rotation sys-
tem will be used, with ﬁrst extra
delegate‘ being awarded to the
Senior Class. 4’
Enthusiasm Stressed

At the present time, the college
has six members at large, two for
each of the three upper class.levels.
If theywere-to receive another, the
senior class would be awarded one
more delegate; if they were to lose
one, then the Sophomore class
would take the loss.- At present,
the School of Engineering & Mines
has four members-at—large, and
Bus. Ad., two.

By the new plan,- MC lrepresen-,
tatives expect more interest and

enthusiasm during the Apr. 7 elec-

tions than ever before. Each_ of
the classes will also beneﬁt, since

presidents, who have not been ac-
tive previously, will becbme inte-
gral members of’ council and ben-

eﬁt their classes by promoting stu-
dent programming through their
classes.

Political Combinations .

MC has effected a -plan" forfcan—
didacy combinations. Students may
run for both class oﬁice and Stu-
dent Congress positions, or for a
«class ofﬁce and members—a_t-large
V-of MC. However, no -person can
campaign for both SC and MC'po—
sitions. If a class president is also
nominated to SC, his choiceimust
be either ’to represent his class at
MC or serve on SC. If he chooses
to serve .on SC, his vice_president
will become the class delegate to
Men’s Council. If he is elected to
class presidency and a member—at—
large in MC, his member-at-large
status will be dropped and given to
the candidate with the second
highest vote. ' / ’

Under I the new constitution,
committees will function to organ-
ize realms of activity. Commis-
sions have been established to
serve as advisory bodies which will
investigate projects and problems
and bring them to the attention of
council. When a commission’s rec-
ommendations requires action, a
special committee will be created.
The various commissions are as
follows:_ athletics, freshman orien-
tation and traditions, men’s lounge’,
publications, religious, s 0 Ci a l s,
speech, music, dramatics, and pub-
lic relations. ~.

In the absence of Tom Piemme,
MC prexy who helped design the
new constitution, Jack Hardman,
assistant to the dean of-men, con-

To spread student participation,-

commissions rather than standing’

 

en's Council Revision

ducted the discussion. At one point
during the meeting, some of the
representatives got up to leave.

Hardman reprimanded them and-
Congress for a general lack of in-’
terestin MC aﬁairs. Said he, ‘.‘If -l

you want a council for men, then
act responsible for it.’ If not for
yourselves, be considerate of those‘
who have worked on this project.”

Active Liason Needed _
There was only a quorum pres-
ent to conduct the business when
Don Gartner,'MC secretary, made
the motion’ for acceptance of the
constitution. Both he and Hard-

m_a,n urged that the constitution be,

passed in order "to make MC a
functioning unit again and an ac-
tive liason between male students
and the administration. 1

Friday afternoon, Tom Piemme
presented the delegate proposal to
a meeting of class presidents who
accepted it is a means to get their
classes functioning-. While only
nine class presidents were present,
they expressed aneed for more or-
ganization and representation of all
schools in one major unit.

Centralized Groups Needed

Dick Deitrick, Col. ’54 president, ‘
summed up the purpose of the ‘

move by saying it will “centralize

groups so that we will have a more

uniﬁed student body, yet not lose
the individuality and traditions of
each of the schools}? . '

Don Gartner, Bus. Ad. ’55,lsa_id:
“I think it is a great thing because
it’ll be a better way to get us in-
terrelated’ and to. increase activi.
ties in the classes.” I .

Piemme stated that he had been
looking through pastelection’ re-_
sults and, “If this system worked
last year, we wpuld have had -the
best Men’s Council you eversaw.”

Much of the discussion was

gearedto the need of getting more _ i

freshmen. to take an active part in
extra curricular activities.

That's A_,Morra.. . . V

“ By Vince’ Leonard I

(Open letter. to Leo M., Bemis,
IM Director). . T ‘
Dear Mr. B:

Why riot add “Morra,” the Ital-
ian ﬁnger-ﬂinging game to your
vast intra-mural sports p'rogram?_

-I hear that chessand bridge are up .

‘for entry. I’m-sure that -morra is

» more fun. :Besides, ch"ess‘~Tis too

long, period. ,
And listen, Leo. You don’_t need
any special gear to play, morra

‘either. For when the urge ‘to play

is felt, all. a competitor needs is
one good handful of ﬁngers, a lusty

voice, and a knowledgeof Italian .

cardinals" from two _to- ten. The
number one is not used since—you
can’t throw two half ﬁngers to add
up to one. ‘I

No Help Needed ..

So you see, L.B., you wouldn’t
even have to be responsible for
any sort of paraphernalia.
chess boards or little wooden
midget bishops to lug around—not
even a’ deck of cards to carry.

I think you had better harness
rnorra into the conﬁnes ‘of the in-
tra—mural‘toute—suite, for the game
is running wild all over the uni-

No,

versity: Guys ‘are playing it in
dull math class__es, and even in
the cafeteria--during serving hours
yet, Maybe the. cafeteria sign,

signs to read: “No studying, card-
playing, or Morra-Playing during
serving hours.” ’
Rules Simp|e’Too ,

_ The rules of morra are very sim-
ple too. Two _'or- more‘ players

you can play partners if you like.
The competitors face each‘ other,

bra’-shirted variety, anyone will

‘ously throw the right hand for-
ward with the fingers, extended.
With. the’ _throw',-'’ the players call
the number. - The player calling‘
the total ‘ﬁngers extended is given
the point._ If neither player scores
or both call the same number,
there is_no -score and the action
continues. In team =matches, play
alternates between opposing play-
ers. ‘ _ , ' '

And since this a university, sure-
ly you must be subjected to some
history of the game:

Back in the fourteenth century,
when Genoa was waging war with

makers will have to alter their»

make up the game, or like bridge,-

and when therfeferee ;(not theze-_

do) shouts “go,” they simultane-I

er to |M  Director

Pisa, morra was‘ born. .As Genoansn

ﬁnally won "out, "they carried away
all the _Pisan - galleons, rpressed
them into service, and made slaves

of them. With nothing to do but

row a boat, mental: deterioration
threatened. ‘(The Pisans rowed
the boat.) So in the rest periods,
someone invented the business of
ﬂinging outa ﬁstful of» digits and
inviting’ the guy‘ next to ‘him, to
match the _play. Hence, -morra.
Everybody: Plays It _, _
So move’, man, move. Yjou’d get
more morra players than. chess or

‘bridge players. And incidentally,

don’t think for a minuteonly Ital-
ians play it. When a Polish or _a

German-patented guy -‘gets the ‘S

I hankering. to play, out ﬂies a hand

which “saws_the air” and a voice
which “splitsthe air.”
Incclosing Leo‘, I would like to

anecdote to you a little item to '

further show the universality of
the game. Last Christmas, a trail

of choraleers was trudging along ,

singinglcarols. At the end of the

line, .two buckish fellows were -

shouting out “Quattro, Sette.” Sho’
’nuff, they were playing morra.
Sincerely yours,
V. L.

To theiEditor
Editor, I i i
The Pitt News;
The question of women cheer-

leaders has been a hot potato since

it was brought up, in the “Balk
Referandum.” It seems that the
main drawback lies not with the
total administration, but with one
portion‘of it.- No more need be
said on that point.

Exactly why a girl can not be
considered a “lady_’.’ because she is

"a 'cheer1e'ader',“I don’t know. Might

it be said-here that the;-I girls that
go into Physical Education are
_ath1etica1ly_ inclined, . ergo they are

 

    

net ladies. Many a parent is dis-
appointed then.

Everything goes into the deﬁni-
tion of a lady. Manners, sweet-
ness, and knowing how to act in
different situations. The ‘girls
aren’t given much credit for know-
ing how "to act in front of a large
crowd. Just because some girls
have more school spirit than others

' and think that they can help by

being cheerleaders, why should
they be condemned as not “lady-
like” or ‘Fhighschool girlish”? A
cheerleader, boy or girl, gets out in
front of a crowd to lead cheers, not
to make a spectacle of himself. If
it were so, then every cheerleader
in the country would be an abso-
lute fool! ‘
Cheerleading is ,_ an honor. It
represents the _University_ just as
‘football, scholarship," or Senior
Queen. There is more grace in_

Civils Take Engineer Crown  N

With‘ 50-34+ Win, Over EE’s

. ’ By BERNARD MORRIS

The Civil A’s preserved their unblemished record and

clinched ﬁrst place honors in the Engineering section of the
IM league by trouncing the once-9* '

beaten Electrical Engineers, 50-34,
at the Fieldhouse Monday_

The A’s will meet the Dental
Frosh, winners‘ in. Professional
League play, in a -playoff ‘Thurs-
day or Friday. .

Both teams started off rather
slowly and the scoring was limit-
ed in the ﬁrst period which ended
with the EE’s showing an 11-10
advantage. '

, Free Throwing Off

The tempo was also slow dur-
ing the second period and only
classy defensive work by the A’s
ﬂoormen kept them in the game.
Stan Sikora hit two long set-shots
to pace their attack. Bob Wied-
wald hit twice for the Civils right
beforethe half. Both teams had
msierable shooting at the foul line
where Civil hit two for six and
Electrical only two for ten.

John Wymand hit a basket right
after the tipoff to start the: third
quarter and the game was dead-
locked for the second time. The

Electricals then. went on a scor-

ing spree and took a 24-18 lead,

Hanlon hit for a ﬁelder as the
stanza ended with the EE’s, lead.
iixg. 31-26. »

A’s Pull Ahead '

Bernie Luterancik steered a re.-

lentless CE attack during the final
period with an exhibition of

classy passing that had the‘ spec--

tators gasping. The Civil A’s tied
the score at 31-31 and from that
point scored almost at will. Paul
Saylor, scrappy C_ E. basketeer,
caught ﬁre and hit for four buckets
during the quarter. The Electrical

Engineers couldn’t hit aﬁeld. goal 1

during this entire canto and their
scoring was liimted to 3 foul shots.
Saylor and Wiedwald paced the
victors with>14 points while I-Ian.
lon had 13 for the losers.

“Dehydrla1'ipon"
Adds Strength

By

RUSS FRANKE
Sports Editor

To the many new fans the Pitt wrestlers have attracted
'since their accession to national ‘wrestling fame, their phe-

nomenal rise may appear unusualﬁ

or «merely fortunate. But there is
nothing unusual about extremely
hard work and rigorous training
producing results———and therein lies
the success of the team.

Most every fan knows that ath-
letes must undergo a conditioning
program prior to the start of the
season and stay in shape there-
after, but just what do they do,
speciﬁcally? -

First of all, according to Peery’s
system, the training period starts
four-months before the ﬁrst match,
in which the candidates run cross-
country, perform calisthenics, and
practice holds. Then 7 they must
maintain their peak throughout
the season with similar workouts

almost daily, in addition to actual .

mat work from warmups to all-out
wrestling.

In the meantime, though, they
must beware of overtraining to
avoid becoming stale. Another
thing in regard to excessiveness
-—-the experts stress that a Wres-
tler need not be musclebound,
the important "factors are co-
ordination, balance, timing, and
precision. .

The really ticklish part comes

.under the heading of weight con-

trol, which, by the way, Peery
used to advantage in the Penn
State meet. By careful dieting, or
“dehydration,” coaches sometimes
have to switch their boys around

in various weight classes, either to
gain strength or replace an in-
jured man. ,

In order to lose ﬁve or ten
pounds, an athlete must be in good
condition, to begin with, and fol-
low a strict diet, besides. Forex-
ample, Peery lists a menu almost

entirely free of fats and no water

or cold drinks at all, with only
two slices of bread allowed daily.
If the diet is followed carefully,
there is no danger in reducing
fast enough to be ready for a
coming meet.

After Ronnie Kurtz, a, 130-
pounder was lost through an
injury, Bill Kozy, a 137 —pounder,
had to be moved into the gap.
George Matthews, at 147 ordin-
arily, moved down to the 137;
then, to ﬁll his place Bob Cook
dropped from 147.

To vary his lineup for the all-

‘important Penn State meet lat-

er, Peery ordered more reducing.
This time,
Uram cut down to 147, Ed DeWitt
pared from 167 to replace Uram,
and Joe Solomon took off ten
pounds to ﬁll DeWitt’s vacancy.
All this reducing does not ap-
pear so. simple when translated
into physical terms, according to
the dieting and drying out de-
scribed above. But the boys did
it and the result was the Eastern

' championship.

Veteran Track Coach Carl Ol-

two-mile relay team performance
at the Cleveland Knights of.Co-
lumbus meet with a sharp com-
parison to the previous week when
the quartet ran the fastest race in
the-nation.

“We were as imperfect Friday
night as we were perfect the week
before,” was the mentor’s re-

‘ mark, referring, to the ﬁfth place

after setting‘ a Milwaukee Journal
record earlier. Michigan and Mich-
igan State, both beaten at Milwau-
kee, topped the Panthers at Cleve-
land. . ‘

Meanwhile, Olson also announc-
ed the Spring track schedule fea-
turing the appearance of Miami

A modest little freshman named Caspar Doyle found
himself getting quite neurotic. It seemed that every time a
girl looked at Caspar, he blushed. His sallow little cheeks,
turned a violent crimson. Then he would blush more because

he was blushing.

He didn't get very far with the ladies and began brooding.
Fortunately, the was a wealthy modest little freshman, and
‘he ﬁnally bundled his problem off to a psychiatrist.

“I even hate my shirts. I know when I wear a white shirt it's’
only going to make my blush look redder,” he dolefully

intoned from the couch.

The head-shrinker’s eyes lit up with dollar signs. He said:

“Ahern. This trauma is obviously deep-seated and will take

a long time to unravel. ‘But meanwhile, try wearing some »"
Vanahue shirts. Van Heusen makes them in lots of colors that.‘

will tone down your blush and you’re bound to like the

smart new collar styles. For your practical side, they’re ﬁne

smooth broadcloth, color fast and Sanforized.

See my nurse for the bill, please!”

Caspar bought Vanahue in all the colors and smart new collar
styles for $395 each. It worked. So many of the girls look at
him now, he blushes constantly. Everybody thinks he just

looks rugged and virile.
