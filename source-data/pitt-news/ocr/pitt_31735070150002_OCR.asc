In some cases, it’s who you know

Personal connections help many recent graduates find jobs — where they might not have access otherwise

By Megan Trimble
For The Pitt News

 Sophomore Jeff DeWalt spends his sum-

mers interning at Michael Baker Corpora-
tion, a leading engineering firm based in
Moon Township, Pa., with nothing more
than a high school diploma and an in-
progress. college transcript.

' DeWalt, a civil engineering major, has
a connection to the company through
his uncle and other family friends who
serve as his personal contacts within the
company.

“There are more qualiﬁed people [for
the job] compared to me at this stage in
my schooling, so contacts help a lot,” De-
Walt said. “I wouldn’t have my job now if
it wasn’t for personal contacts.”

The Michael Baker Corporation could
not be reached for comment on their hir-
ing practices.

Such networks in the workplace and
personal contacts within companies open
communication between job seekers and
employers. While networking can jump-
start a student’s application process,
connections aren’t the only aspect that

employers consider.

Barbarajuliussen, assistant director of
the Career Development and Placement
Assistance Office, did not deny that know-
ing people is a real and relevant issue.

“Networking and impressing the ‘right’
people is the best strategy for all majors
and all companies,” she said in an email.
“Personal referrals put you heads and
shoulders ahead of your competition.”

Juliussen said that a job seeker should i

mention a contact in their interviews —-
tactfully referring to the contact and how
that individual has encouraged the job
seeker to pursue an interest with that spe-
ciﬁc employer. ‘

Junior psychology and economics
major Ken Moeller agreed that there is
importance in networking and referrals,
but he noted the potential for unfair ad-
vantages. '

“It’s more likely people are going to be
more interested or invested if they know
someone in the company or ﬁeld,” Moeller

~ said. “But it can be a disadvantage -if they

do not know anyone, and because of that

I would say that it could be unfair.”
Businesses often have corporate poli-

cies on hiring that reference the process

‘‘I wou|o|n’t
have a job 
right HOW
if it wasn’t
for personal
contacts.”

of employee referrals.

Pittsburgh’s BNY Mellon, a leading as-
set management and securities services
company, publishes its formal policy on
personal referrals through details outlined
in their corporate policies on hiring.

Lane Cigna, an employee in BNY Mel-
lon’s Corporate Communications Depart-
ment, said in an email that all hiring prac-
tices coincide with the outlined corporate
policies on hiring. These policies say that
the employers will take into consideration
any-formal or personal recommendations
presentedby a potential employee.

“Hiring decisions are made by the hir-
ing manager in accordance with corporate
policies on employment,” Cigna said. “All
applicationsfmuslt be submitted online,
and the process is initiated and coordi-
nated by Human Resources.” ‘

Cigna said that_not all workplace con-
nections fall in line with hiring policies.

Cigna said that a scenario where a husband, ‘
and wife would work in the same group

and complete the same assignments would
not appropriately meet BNY Mellon’s cor-
porate policies.

Thepmper way to keep in touch with internship supervisors

- By Gwenn Barney '
Senior Staff Writer

The typical rules for internship success are
pretty straightforward - show up on time,
dress according to the internship standards
and take on any task suggested by an intern-

’ ship supervisor. But there’s one aspect of

internship success that often falls by the
wayside: Many interns neglect to keep in
touch with their internship supervisors once
they complete their time with a company,‘
business or nonproﬁtorganization.

“If you had a positive experience and '
intend to put your internship experience
on your resume, then you should deﬁnitely
maintain some contact with your supervi-
sor,” said Aly_son Kavalukas, the internship
coordinator of Pitt’s Office of Student Em-
ployment and Placement Assistance.

“If you maintain some form of contact,
then it will be easier to reach out when the
time comesto ask for networking contacts
in that ﬁeld, additional internships, job
shadowing experiences or ﬁ.1ll—time wor ,”
she said. A I V

Kavalukas recommends that students
try to touch base with a recent internship
supervisor once a semester. , ,  ‘

“Use positive opportunities to tell them
about experiences, success, new jobs, how

the internship prepared them for something
at school or work, etc.-,” she-said. I

She said email is the best way to reconnect
with an internship supervisor at ﬁrst, though
phone calls present another- good medium
for connecting, especially if students have
more time to share new information or had
a closer relationship-with supervisors. -

Sophomorejaclyn Krogh, currently par-
ticipating in a co-‘op program with US Air-
ways, said she uses an email-to-phone-call
strategy. ' _

“Usually I’ll start with an email and then
move to'a phone call,” Krogh said, although
she admitted that “sometimes the beginning

- of a phone conversation can be awkward.”

Senior Naji Alibeji periodically emails his
supervisor from a past internship with Acu-
tronic USA, a motion simulator supplier.

“I’ll ask how he’s doing,” Alibeji said.
“When I was applying to graduate school,
I told them about how my experience with
Acutronic helped me afterwards.”

Email also serves as a solid tool for
students who participated in internships
at locales distant from Pitt or their home-
towns. » '

Two years ago, senior Eli Gabel-Frank
spent his summer completing an internship
at Warm Heart, a grassroots community-
development group, located in Phrao, a rural

__ area in Thailand. He was able to keep in touch

with his supervisor from that internship by
email, despite the distance between Pitts-
burgh and Phrao. ,

“I’ll email him sometimes,” Gabel-Frank
said. “If I need a recommendation, I’ll write,
‘Hey, how are you. Hope everything’s good.’
I’ll tell him what I’m doing and what I need
the recommendation for.”

The one medium Kavalukas doesn’t rec-
ommend for keeping in touch with past su-
pervisors is social networking.

“With the goal of maintaining a profes-

' _ sional relationship in mind, it is not advised

to use social media or texting exclusively for
professional communications,” she said. '
Kavalukas encourages students who
formed strong bonds with past internship
supervisors to meet up with the supervisors

in person. ‘ -,.

“If you had a positive experience and
maintain a good contact, it may serve you

well to have coffee or lunch at some point. ’

While this is not necessary, it is a nice ges-
ture_ as graduation approaches, if a strong

relationship wasactually forrhed,” Kavalu- ‘

kas said. A '

Even if a signiﬁcant amount of time has
passed and a student has failed to keep in
touch with an internship supervisor dur-.

ing that period, Kavalukas emphasized the .

importance of reconnecting with any super-'
visor before asking him or her for a recom-

mendation for a new job or internship.

“It is critical for them to reach out before
listing [a former supervisor] as_a reference
for another position. While they are gener-
ally willing to provide a’ reference, you do

not want for them to be caught off guard or '

unprepared when a reference call comes,”
she said. “Eventhough someone may say to
feel free to use them for a reference anytime,
it is still mutually beneﬁcial for them to know
when to expect a reference check.”

Junior Nicole Heenan, currently an intern
at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said she believes
that keeping in contact with past internship
supervisors is essential for ﬁxture success.

“You need to have a big network to get
jobs,” Heenan said. “You never know when

‘ they can help you and you can help them.”

Junior Elena Giel, an intern at ﬁnancial
advisory ﬁrmjanney Montgomery Scott LLC,
agreed with Heenan, but she also held that

' post-internship networking should be more

about maintaining true connections with
employers and coworkers and less about
creating relationships as stepping stones
for future success.

“Too many people get caught up in net-

. working rather than genuinely talking with
— their boss andforming a relationship,” Giel

said. “Having a personal relationship that’s
still work-appropriate makes it easier to stay
in touch afterwards.” I

Financial tips for graduates

Graduating students should look ahead‘ to future ﬁnances‘

By Gretchen Andersen
Staff Writer

Although alcollege graduate’s ﬁrst paycheck
might entice them to spend money on luxu-

sries, Brian Koble thinks students should

instead be thinking about retirement.

“There is a temptation to spend new-
found income, but your early twenties is
the most important time in life to save, be-
cause the more money you save in yourearly
twenties will compound signiﬁcantly over
the decades,” said Koble, the director of
research of Hefren—Tillotson’s investements
advisory group.

He said the number—one rulefor new‘
graduates isto “live a step below your _.

means.” .

Graduating students should start think-
ing about the future and what costs will come
along with it. When deciding on purchases,
including the cost of graduate school, stu-
dents must weigh the costs and beneﬁts of
each decision and consider which option
will pay out in the long run. ‘

Frederik Schlingemann, Barry]. Epstein
Faculty Fellow in Finance ‘and associate pro-
fessor of business administration at the Katz
Graduate School of Business, said it is impor-
tant for students to weigh costs and beneﬁts

 
 
   
  
  
 
  
  
     

carefully when making decisions with their
money. He said it is never too early to be
thinking about the future.

“The ﬁiture starts now, and any decision

‘ you make with respect to retirement, for
example, will greatly depend on how much
time you have between now and retirement
because of the power of compounding re-
turns, or interest on interest,” Schlingemann
said in an email. . .

When graduates receive their ﬁrst pay--
checks, they should give preference to pur-
chases‘ that satisfy basic needs and meet
long-term goals. Luxuries and big purchases
should be last on the list, Schlingemann
said. ' . l . —

“Purchasing a ﬁrst home may provide
you with a way to save for the long run but i
could also present the buyer with some seri-
ous costs. In the end, common sense and a
cost-beneﬁt analysis should provide guid-
ance,” Schlingemann said. “While buying a
car for the sake of buying a car seems like a
poor spending choice, a car may be needed
to take full advantage of available employ—'
ment opportunities. Again, weigh costs and

. beneﬁts carefully.” _

Students

canlook

for jobs at
the Spring
Career Fair

By Mallory Grossman
News'Eclitor

Although unemployment ﬁgures might be
high nationwide, Pitt hopes that students
can ﬁnd employment and internships from

the 160 employers coming to campus next

week.

The annual Spring Career Fair will take
place in the William Pitt Union Feb. 7 and
Feb. 8. Students of any year and any major’

‘ can attend the fair to network with. em-
ployers and search for internships, co—ops -

and jobs.

Cheryl Finlay, the director of 'Pitt’s Of-
ﬁce of Career Development and Placement
Assistance, said that, as of Monday, about
160 employers had registered to attend
the two—day career fair, but more might
still register.

-Unlike during the Fall Career Fair,
graduate schools typically do not attend
in the spring.

Finlay said that regardless of year, it
is important for all students to attend the
fair. Whether they are looking for.full~time

' or part—time jobs, internships or co—ops,

students will be able to talk with a wide va-
riety of employers. Many of the employers,
Finlay said, will also be holding on—campus
interviews for select students.

“Sophomores and juniors are encour-
aged to attend to seek out internship op-
portunities and part-time employment that
are crucial building blocks for a solid re-
sumé,” Finlay said in an email. “For seniors,
this is the perfect time to explore full—time
opportunitiesavailable after. graduation.
It is a time for.seniors not only to look for
a. job but also to network and build con-
nections with potential employers as they
begin the search for employment.”

Freshmen are also encouraged to at-
tend, Finlay said, because it is never too
early to gain work experience or become
familiar with the fair so that they will be
prepared when they are older and seek-
ing employment. Freshmen can also use
the fair to practice their interviewing and
networking skills.‘

“Obtaining these experiences during
their ﬁrst year will make them more attrac-
tive to employers in the future,” she said.

The career fair will be held over two

GDP grows at slower rate than expected in 4th quarter

By Don Lee
Tribune Washington Bureau (MCT Campus)

WASHINGTON —— The U.S. economy ended
last year on ﬁrmer footing with modestly
stronger growth. But output fell short of
what analysts expected, and signsvpoint to
weakness ahead.

The gross domestic product rose at a 2.8
percent annual rate in the fourth quarter
as consumers bought more cars and other
goods, the Department of Commerce said
Friday. That was below the 3 percent ﬁgure
many analysts had projected. But it was up
from a feeble 1.8 percent-the quarter be-
fore. ’ ’

But the reason for the faster growth
wasn’t encouraging: More than half result-
ed from businesses increasing their stock-
piles of products rather than from sales
of goods and services, which reﬂect actual
demand. I

A big build—up of inventories in one

quarter often means manufacturers and

other companies will buy fewer supplies
in the following months, unless there’s a
surprise burst of orders from consumers
and others. I

But at the moment, there’s little reason to
expect a surge in demand from businesses,
consumers or government. Friday’s report
showed, in fact, that sharp cuts in public
spending were a signiﬁcant drag on the
economy.

Moreover, job growth, though improv-
ing, is far from robust, and the housing mar-
ket remains depressed. Political gridlock
has doomed further ﬁscal efforts to spur
domestic demand, and Europe’s debt woes
and China’s slowdown threaten the global
economy.

“Obviously with bloated inventory gains
last quarter, [businesses] are going to keep
a very tight hold on spending,” said Kathy

Bostjancic, an economist at The Conference

Board, an employer-supported, research
group in New York. ‘ ' _

“The good news is we avoided a reces-
sion,” she said, referring to worries last sum-
mer that the economy was headed into a
double-dip downturn. But what .“you’re left
with is a frustratingly slow recovery.”,

Friday’s report, along with scaled-back
projections issued by the Federal Reserve
earlier this week, suggest that the economy,
despite a recent pick-up in hiring and manu-
facturing, will hit many bumps on the long
path to full recovery. '

The fourth-quarter increase in GDP -
the broadest measure of economic activity
— was just shy of the 3 percent that many
economists were anticipating. For all of last
year, which was marked by problems in Eu-
rope, an earthquake injapan and Washing-

II historical average and very weak consid-

ering the depth of the decline during the
Great Recession. The sluggish pace doesn’t
give employers much incentive to add many
workers; rather, they can satisfy their growth
needs through productivity gains.
Changes in inventory levels can be diffi-
cult to read. In general, companies have been

I operating with very lean inventories.

“There’s a certain amount of risk [be-
cause] if you don’t have the inventory, you
could lose orders,” said Bill Thompson, pres-
ident of Thompson Pump 8: Manufacturing

Co. in Port Orange, Fla. So far, he added, he

has guessed correctly on how much stock to

keep on hand. I V .

To Cliff Waldman, economist at Manu-
facturers Alliance/MAPI, a manufactur-
ing research group, the message from the
fourth-quarter inventory buildup was clear:
“The fundamental story is that demand re-

mains sluggish — and everything else fol— u

Most experts, including those at the
Fed, have been projecting that the econo-

Ben Herzon, a senior economist at Mac-

would grow at a 1.9 percent rate in the ﬁrst

  More collegefreshmen

By Larry Gordon
Los Angeles Times (M CT Campus)

LOS_ ANGELES — Seeing their parents strug-
gle with unemployment and other money
wo rries over, the last few years, the nation’s
current batch of college freshmen increas-

the report also shows that, compared with

students 40 years ago, current freshmen

say they are much more interested in hav— _

ing children. So, Pryor said, they might be
more aware of what it costs to raise and
educate a family. I ,
“They may want to make sure their kids
can go to their ﬁrst-choice colleges without

ingly view a bachelor’s a lot of loans, as op-
degree as a necessary , _v posed to buying the

students across the
country said that-be— ,

reason for attending
college. That is the
strongest response
that’s been made to
that question in the 40
years it has been asked
and is sharply higher -
than the 70.4 percent
reply in 2006, before
the recession began.

coming freshmen at

leges and univer-
sities decided to
participate at the
start of the current

I school year. _
Compared with
classes ahead of
them, today’s re-
»cession—era fresh-
men reported be—
ing more studious
and sober during
. highvschool. These
students might fear
that bad grades and

ing higher education.
For a generation, the
most popular answer was “to learn more
about things that interest me.’: This year,
82.9 percent said that was a major motive.
Butsince 2009, the concern about jobs has
come out on top. . “

I Also setting a record was the response

’ to a query about whether becoming very

well off ﬁnancially is an “essential or very
importan ” objective. The survey showed
that 79.6 percent of the students described
such affluence as a compelling goal, up from
the pre—recession response of73.4 percent
in 2006 and double the levels during the
more counter-cultural 1970s.

“I think it’s understandable. Like every-
body in the country, these students are re-
acting to a time of recession,” saidjohn H.
Pryor, managing director of UCLA’s Higher
Education Research Institute, which con-
ducts the annual survey. ~

’ But he cautioned‘ that it would be wrong
to assumeothat the students want to make
money just for luxurious lifestyles. In fact,

rejections from
good colleges could
lead to economic insecurity, analysts said.

Those whoireported that they studied or
did homework for six or more hours a week
as high school seniors rose to 39.5 percent,
up from 34.7 percent in 2009. In the same
period, the share of students who said they
drank beer frequently oroccasionally in
high school dropped from 39.5 percent to
35.4 percent’ and those who said they spent
some time “partying” every week during
high school declined from 69.7 percent to
65.3 percent.

Liberal social causes are becoming more

popular on campuses, with supportive_re—
sponses to questions about many of these
issues on the rise.

For example, 71.3 percent of students
in the study said they supported gay and
lesbian couples’ right to marry, and 60.7
percent said abortion should be kept legal.

I Additionally, 49.1 percent backed the legal-

ization of marijuana. I

a good idea to seek out contacts who either live
or have lived in your city of interest. People who
have gone through the same moving process
will have indispensable insight to. offer.

“N o matter how may degrees of separation
between you and some of these connections, do
not hesitate to call them or meet them for coffee
to learn all that you can,” Kavalukas said.

Even a destination city itself can serve as a
major resource. For Going, the Berkeley Public
Library was where she spent every day using
the freelnternet access to search for jobs. The

l A library system in any city can offer great ben-

eﬁts to its new residents.

Take Pittsburgh for example: Many of the
city’s neighborhoods have branches of the Car-
negie Library system. These libraries have a
large range of preparation books for the SATs,
GREs and multiple other educational tests, as
well as for the Civil Service examination and
employment-related exams.

Wes Roberts, a senior librarian in the Job
8: Career Education Center of thecarnegie Li-
brary, said that the library offers many means
of assistance to job—hunters, and not onlybooks
and audio or visual resources. _

There are multiple databases that assist
locals in ﬁnding work in the area or creating a
resume. These and other beneﬁcial programs,
such as job clubs, book clubs and language clubs
can help new residents navigate an unfamiliar

get to know people,” Roberts said.

Another important element in the process
of moving and ﬁnding a job is locating a place
to live. .

The cost, size and location of a residence
are all important factors to consider when se-
lecting housing. .

“Adjusting to a living situation can also be P

a challenge. People who move to much‘ larger
cities often ﬁnd themselves sharing a small
apartment with roommates,” Kavalukas said.

Without any contacts in San Francisco, Go-
ing’s search for _a roommate could have been
difficult, but by utilizing Craigslist, she found
a roommate quickly. '

“Unlike at the university level, making
friends is not as simple when moving to an-
other city. The process is slower, but the point
is not to get too lonely in the process of making
friends,” Going said.

In addition to libraries, cities can offer new-
comers other avenues to help meet people in
their same situations andideﬁay the loneliness.
The Pittsburgh Urban Magnet Project is a great
resource for meeting otheryoung professionals
in Pittsburgh, Kavalukas said. With a variety
of activities, the program offers residents th
chance to make new connections. ‘

Despite available support from a city, the
biggest step isto just “go for it,” Going said. “You
need to have a deep-seated faith in yourself.
You need belief in yourselfthat you can do it.
You just have to ‘make the jump.”

 

The service sector is projected to expand while the goods-producing sector is expected to decline.

SIIMMERINTERNSHIP

FROM PAGE 8

“If you really want to intern there, it is

going to put you far above everyone else,” .

she said. _

Kavalukas said that internships are
unique from jobs in that a persistent stu-
dent-can-work with an employer to forge
a custom internship where one might not
have previously existed. ’

For existing positions, the Career Devel-
opment Ofﬁce offers a number of services
to aid students in their search. Kavalukas
said that students should set up an appoint-
ment with a career counselor who can help
them ﬁnd internship opportunities that suit
them. - -

The Office of Career Development also
runs FutureLinks, a website that allows stu-

dents to send their resumés directly to a‘

number of job and internship listings.

Additionally, Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Student Em-
ployment and Placement Assistance will
hold a “Summer Survival” Career Fair on
April 4. This event, which seeks to pair stu-
dents with summer jobs and internships, will
host 75 different organizations and be open
only to Pitt students.

But a potential intern shouldn’t limit her-

" self to the resources on campus. Kavalukas

recommends using other Web searches and
old—fashioned networking to ﬁnd an intern-
ship. .

“Studentsshould be aware that intern-
ing does entail certain sacriﬁces. Most are
unpaid positions, and to take an internship
for credit over the summer, normal tuition
fees apply,” Kavalukas said.

Beneﬁts of the summer internship _

Depending on the opportunity, intern-
ships can be highly competitive, but once
they’re attained they can also be highly
beneﬁcial. _

Tracy Gray, the public and media rela-
tions manager at the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG
Aquarium, manages interns in her depart-
ment, She said that they receive hundreds of
applications for 10 to 25 unpaid positions for
both ofﬁce~ and animal-based internships.

Gray said that the zoo and aquarium
have retained many interns for permanent
employment, but, absent of that, students

. can reap a number of beneﬁts from intern-

ships. V -
“Hopefully they get a good understand-

‘ ing of the ﬁeld, experience that can help
when they graduate and great contacts,”

she said.

Kavalukas noted how beneﬁcial intern-
ships are for building resumés and getting
recommendations, but she also said the
experience gives students the opportunity
to gauge how well they will do in a given
ﬁeld. ’

Kavalukas said internships aren’t just

‘ one—way; interns should expect certain

things out of their ‘employers as well. Em-
ployers must provide students with a learn-

ing experience and students should expect
professionalism and guidance from their
supervisors.

Chapman said that she tries to avoid giv-
ing interns “typical intern-type tasks,” and
instead focuses on teaching. “You want an
internship to be a two—way street,” she said.
“I think that [student interns] should expect
that they will get a valuable experience, but
they’re going to contribute.” '

Gray was also cognisant of the employer’s
responsibility to an intern.

“I think we need to adhere to what we
promise them, teach them as much as pos-

doesn’t follow through on that, the employer

But most companies do not release spe-
cific guidelines on personal connections’
role in hiring. PNC Bank, Alcoa Inc. and
the Bayer Corporation declined to com-.
ment on their hiring policies.

For Pitt students anxious to begin
networking in their fields, Pitt Career
Network provides a resource to practice
networking, and it comprises a database
that features nearly 7,000 alumni who
have volunteered to assist students in ca-

“Nepotism does occur but students

shouldn’t waste time being concerned if
it is fair or unfair,” Juliussen said.

“They should put their energies to-
wards gaining as much experience as pos-
sible and building their transferable skills
to be competitive and attractive to future
employers,” she said.

DeWalt said that individuals seeking
jobs or internships should not undervalue
networking.

“I believe that ﬁrst impressions are just
as important as resumés,” DeWalt‘said.
“At this point, with the economy in the
state it is, there are not as many jobs to
be had. And qualiﬁcations are important,
but having contacts may be just as if not
more [important] .” I

he said, could lead to a reduction in those
projections.

One big unknown going forward is con-
sumer spending, which accounts for about
70 percent of the American economy. Con-
sumers bought more big-ticket items such

7 as cars in the fourth quarter, but retail sales

tailed off. Friday’s data showed that consum-
ers cut into their saving to buy things; the
savings rate dropped to 3.7 percent in the
fourth quarter from more than 5 percent
a year earlier.

Business spending for equipment and
software, which had been robust since the
economic recovery began 2 years ago, soft-
ened toward the end of the year.

U.S. exports, a bright spot in the econ-
omy, also could be crimped by a recession
in Europe.

Given these obstacles, the Fed this week
said it was likely to hold its benchmark
short—term interest rate near zero until" at
least late 2014. Fed officials see the unem-
ployment rate, currently 8.5 percent, staying
uncomfortably high until at least then. The
fourth-quarter data might give _it‘ another
reason to launch another bond-buying effort
to stimulate the economy.

  the most important

—Brian Koble,

ate school, Schlingemann said to evaluate
the cost of graduate school and weigh it
against future salary increases as a result
of the degree.

“Student loans are typically loans that can

. be deferred in terms of payback as long as

you stay in school, and interest is often tax
deductible, providing fora nice government
subsidy. Students should always be prudent

. in their ﬁnancial decisions and discuss these
choiceswith knowledgeable ﬁnancial ad—, ,
‘ visers, and ideally take a class in personal

ﬁnance,” he said. _

Koble said it “doesn’t make sense” for
students to go to graduate school because
they have no job prospects. A '

He said there needs to be economic merit
for students attending graduate school, and
students should look at-grad school as an
investment, not a last resort.

“The potential earnings power must com-
pensate for the loans,” Koble said.

Both Koble and Schlingemann acknowl:
_edged the ‘importance of immediately sav-
ing for retirement when graduates get their
ﬁrst jobs. R

' Koble said a good starting point for gradu-
ates saving for retirement is setting aside 10
percent of their paycheck.

“Most people underestimate the cost of

retirement and the need to save money early '
g on to get to a comfortable retirement situa-

tion,” Schlingemann said. ,
Schlingemann said graduates must use

. common sense when making ﬁnancial de-

cisions.

“Think in terms of trade-offs: Any dollar .

spent today cannot be spent again, but any
dollar saved today will lead to more spending
potential tomorrow. Learn to focus on costs
just as much as you would on beneﬁts when
making decisions,” Schlingemann said. I

days: Feb. _7 will be geared toward techni-
cal ﬁelds, including engineering, IT and
computer science, while Feb. 8 will host
employers looking for candidates for non-
technical positions, in ﬁelds such as busi-
ness, science, health and the arts.

Finlay said that students often have luck
securing jobs and internships at the fair.

“Employers are attending the fair be-
cause they want to hire University of Pitts-
burgh students,” she said. ,

The best way for studentsto handle the
career fair is -to come prepared, Finlay said.

Students should know which employers
they are interested in talking to and bring
enough resumes to handout. They should
also be ready to give recruiters a short in-
troduction expressing their interest in the
company arrdany prior experience they
might have in the ﬁeld. .

To prepare for the fair beforehand,
Finlay recommends students bring both
resumés tailored to each employer they

' plan on talking to and general resumes to ,

hand out.

._ “Knowing some background informa-
tion about the companies will help you to
stand out and look prepared,” Finlay said‘,
adding that dressing in the proper business
attire will also help students look ready. I

Rapper Big Seayngto cometo PittlinMarch

By Danny Zaidi
Staﬂ" Writer

With his new album set to be released
this spring, Big Sean, recruited by
the Pitt Program Council, will be
performing at the Fitzgerald Field
House in March. '

The Pitt Program Council has
also narrowed its search for Bigelow
Bashperformersto a few acts, in-
cluding Cobra Starship and Gavin
DeGraw. , -

Alana Miller, the special events
director of the Pitt Program Council,
said that picking Big Sean wasn’t an
easy decision. Several other con-
tenders were considered, includ-
ing artists such as Wiz Khalifa, Mac
Miller and]. Cole. . ' .

“We kind of felt they were over-
done in Pittsburg ,” the special
events directorsaid. ‘ ’ ,

Miller said that the process of
picking an act starts early in the
school year. It starts with a com-

mittee of students that is open to
anyone, and throughout the fall and
beginning of the spring these stu-
dents brainstorm what performers
they want to bring in. '

‘fIt’s not as easy to say we want
Big Sean, and then we get Big Sean.
We come up with names, and then
take them to ‘our manager, and then
we try to match up .-who’s touring,
who we can afford and try to match
upathe dates. Big Sean was our best
match,” Miller said.

.PPC doesn’t disclose the bud-

“ get for these performances, but
the money mostly comes from the
' Student Activities Fund. This keeps
tickets to the hip—hop concert at $5
each and admission to Bigelow Bash
.in the spring free for,Pitt students.

Matt Auger, executive board di-
rector of PCC, said that the budget
for the performances stays consis-
tent from year to year.

“ [The price] tends to stay in the
same range. We have to keep within
our budget, which is similar year to

year. We try to keep everything as
low as possible. Obviously we want
a good name, but we don’t want
to blow a bunch of money just be-

_‘ cause,” Auger said.

Tickets go on sale Feb. .1 Cat 10
a.m. at the Pitt Program Council’s
ticket office in the William Pitt
Union. ,

Auger said that the line for the
B.o.B. concert tickets last year
wrapped all the way around the sur-

. rounding concourse, and Miller said

students started lining up at about
8:30 a.m. to guarantee themselves
a ticket. .. ,
There will be a total of 4,000
tickets —— 2,000 seated and 2,000

‘standing —— on sale, with no limit

on how many tickets a student can
purchase. .

One point that both Auger and
Miller emphasizedis that tickets
are only for students with valid Pitt‘
IDs. - ‘ -

Pitt files countersuit
against Hfaywood_

' \
By Andrew Shull
Assistant News Editor

\

l

While Michael Haywood only.
served as head coach of Pitt’s foot-

ball team for less than three weeks

more than one year ago, the legal
drama surrounding his terminai
tion' appears far from over.

Pitt ﬁled a counterclaim against
Haywood on Oct.14, 2011, citing

‘violation of a conﬁdentiality clause
, that was supposed to outlive the

term of his contract.

The University hired Haywood
Dec. 15, 2010, and then ﬁred him
Jan. 1, 2011, after he was arrested
on charges of domestic abuse
against the mother of his child in
South Bend, Ind. _

At a court hearing on Feb. 11,
Haywood entered a court diver-
sion program in Indiana, which
requires 60 hours of community
service and a psychological evalua-
tion. If he completes the program,
the charges will be dismissed in
one year. _

Haywood ﬁrst sued the Univer-
sity in September, claiming that
the University owed him $3.75

, million in damages, in addition

to “attorney’s fees, court costs,

. mental anguish, pre—judgement

and post—judgement interest, ex-
emplary damages [and] all other
costs to which he is entitled,” ac-
cording to the suit.

‘‘If they didn’t

have cause to

’ fire him, they,
will have to pay
the $3.75 million

he’s suing for.”

  -Haider Hamoudi

‘\ ‘ .-
‘ University spokesmanjohn F?-
dele, declined comment on Pitt’s
suit and said the University does

not comment on pending litiga-
tion. - ' _

Pitt’s countersuit alleges that
Haywood-violated the terms of his
contract by disclosing details of
his contract that were ‘supposed

to be conﬁdential. The University

- is alleging that Haywood and his
f attorneys released details of the

contract to the media following
his termination. , 2

' University officials did not
name a speciﬁc ﬁgure that they
think the school is entitled to or
what it is they are seeking in the
suit. - ,
Tony Buzbee, Haywood’s attor-
ney, characterized the countersuit
as “frivolous.” '

“They think it’s going to intimi-
date the coach,” he said. “Our posi-
tion on the countersuit is that_it’s
meritless". That’s all we really need
to say about it.” '

Haider Hamoudi, a Pitt law
professor and expert on contract
law,-said that he thought it would
be very unlikely that the Univer-
sity would pursue the case if it was
frivolous. But without seeing the
contract, which is conﬁdential,
he said there would be no way to
know. .

“I would be very surprised if
[the University’s suit] was frivo-
lous,” he said. “I think they are
articulating an actual interest. But
they might not win.”

Pat Chew, another Pitt law pro-
fessor and an expert on employ-
ment law, made the distinction
between being ﬁred with cause
and without cause.

“We have what’s ‘called ‘em-
ployment at will,”’ she said. “That
means that you can be ﬁred at any
time, but you can also quit at any
time.” ’

However, Chew explained that

some employment contracts have.

clauses that deﬁne what constitutes
cause. Without seeing Haywood’s
contract, she wouldn’t speculate
on whether or not the University
ultimately had cause to ﬁre him. ,
After reviewing the original

‘ suit_ and the University’s response,

Hamoudi said that the case boils

By Gwen Barney
Senior Staff Writer

Kiva Han employee Holly McDevitt
has heard the same question many
times over the past week.

“Are you closing?” awoman asks

before ordering at the coffee shop’s A ,

counter. V

“Yes,” McDevitt answers. “But
it’s easier if you read the sign.” She
motions to a framed piece of paper
leaning against the cash register
that announces the store’s Feb. 19
closing. 5 ''

After more than 15 ‘ years in
Oakland, the Kiva Han coffee shop,
located at the corner of Forbes Av-1

enue and Craig Street and p':o‘pular=

for its laid-back counterculture at-
mosphere and in-store-use board
games, will shut its doors.

“I’m bummed out about it really,”
McDevitt, 21, said. “I liked working
here. If you’ve ever seen the movie
Empire Records, working here re-
minds me of that movie. There’s a

certain subculture.”

Increased rent is the primary
culprit responsible for the closing.
"‘At this location, the rent is
around six times higher than the
amount of rent at Oh Yeah! Ice
Cream 8: Coffee Co. in~Shadyside,”
said longtime Kiva Han employee

Tyler Bryan, a senior accounting‘

major at Pitt,

Bryan said that Kiva Han’s own-
ers made a deal with the owner of
their shop’s property to pay rent
month to month at a reduced rate.
But part of the agreement was that
if a new buyer was willing to sign
the higher-priced, year-long lease,

Kiva‘Han would pack up and leave
the storefront within 60 days.

“We’re not really at a risk of go-
ing under,”_Bryan said. “It was just
the whole rent aspect.”

The Silk 8: Stewart Development
group, which owns the property, did
notrespond to multiple requests for
comment.

With the lease for the property
already signed by a new incoming

tenant, The Bagel Factory, and Kiva 

Han owner John Mutchka already

hatching plans to open a food truck, -
the chances of Kiva Ha/n reversing a
with the bagels ‘ I

its decision to close ‘seem nonex-
istent.

“He’s super excited and passion— 7
ate about [the food truck idea], so I
I don’t think there’s any chance,”

McDevitt said of the store remain-
ing open. ‘

nalizing plans to open a food truck
that will cruise around Pittsburgh’s
suburbs and serve soup and sand-
wiches, among other foods. His new
business venture will be known as
GetLadled.

Though the Kiva Han storefront
will close, Kiva Han coffee can still
be purchased online at www.kiva—
han.com.

Patrons of Kiva Han packed the
coffee shop this weekend in antici-
pation of its impending closing. '

Disappointment, tragedy and
heartbreak were the words sopho-
mores Conor Voigt, Michael Giblin
and Gabe Appel—Kraut used to de-
scribe the news about the closing of
their favorite coffee shop.

“It’s just a sucky thing about

. America that cool places like this

can’t exist,” Appel—Kraut said. “We’ll
probably just end up making cof-

  Coffee shop Kiva Han to close  

fee in the apartment now.’There’s
something about a place like this,
they just put more love into their
coffee.”

Juniors Katie Markovich and
Kathryn Scheuring shared in Appel-
Kraut’s mourning. ’ A

“T_here’s more of a sense of
community in this place,” Scheur-

ing said, contrasting Kiva Han with ‘

chain coffee shops. __ --

“Even if.it’s the ﬁrst time you’ve

come here, you get that sense of
community,” Markovich added.
Out with the board games, in

and Shadyside, will take over owner-

[  Kiva Han’s piece of prime realty

7 “We’re very?exc_ited about it,”
Bagel Factory co-owner. David
Feldstein said. “It’s a great location.

The traffic there is wonderful. We ' [

wanted to be on that corner for 10
years.” ' ’
Feldstein shares ownership re-
sponsibilities with his mother,]une,
and Pitt alumnus Charles Avalli.
The owners believe their store
can ﬁll a unique niche in the.Oakland
community. '
“There’s not really a place for
breakfast on [North Craig Street].
Not a bagel shop. Every college has
a bagel shop,” Feldstein said.
In addition to bagels made in-

store, the new shop will offer fresh -

salads, deli sandwiches and side
dishes. The store will also team up
with what Feldstein described as" a
“popular local coffee company” to
offer coffee.

The owners said that they were

not yet prepared to reveal the name
of their ﬁiture coffee supplier.
While Feldstein signed the lease
for the property between six and
eight months ago, the business
won’t open until renovations are
completed -— a project with a tenta-
tive late—summer completion date.
“It’s a gut job,” Feldstein said.
“Everything’s coming out.” [
Renovation plans include instal-
lation of televisions and open—air

windows that will completely open
during warm weather.

Feldstein said the turnover of the
property from Kiva Han to his busi-
ness is incorrectly being heralded

as an “independent David versus

corporate Golia ” story.

“We’re not a corporate grunt,”
Feldstein said. “We’re a family-
owned business. Hopefully the com-
munity will support us the way they
supported Kiva Han.”

izing the details for Bigelow Bash,
which is held during the latter part
of the semester. Pop artist Ke$ha
performed at last year’s Bash.

Auger said they have ideas about
who the performers might be this

year, but “we'don’t like to release
anything until we have the contract
ﬁnalized.”

Miller did say that they have set-
tled on two potential candidates for
the spring festival.

“Cobra Starship’s in our consid-
eration, but we are also looking at
other things, too. We looked at Gavin
DeGraw,” Miller said. “Spring is a

little bit harder. For Bigelow Bash,
we try to do something poppier —
it’s harder to ﬁnd someone in our
price range.” .

Both concerts will have an open-
ing act from Pitt selected through a
rap battle and a battle of the bands.
At least half the members of the

. participating acts must be Pitt stu-

dents.

On Feb. 24 at Nordy’s Place, a hip-
hop battle will occur. Each group will
get 10 minutes to perform, and three
judges will pick the winner that will
open for Big Sean, Miller said.

He said that sign-ups forthe hip-
hop battle will start next week.

. “I think it’s a cool opportunity
for Pitt students to be able to say, ‘I
opened for Big Sean,’ so a lot of their
friends will come out,” Auger said.

down to the speciﬁc language of
the contract. .

“If they didn’t have cause to
ﬁre him, they will have to pay him
the $3.75 million he’s suing for,”
Hamoudi said. “If they did have
cause, [Haywood] will get noth-
ing.” -

But Buzbee is conﬁdent that the
University_didn’t have cause. He_al—
leged that the University “jumped
to conclusions” when they ﬁred
Haywood following his arrest.

-Buzbee said that the Univer-
sity didn’t do enough to ascertain
whether or not Haywood had actu-

ally done anything wrong.

“They just went off of what they
saw on TV,” he said. “That’s not the

THE SCHAFFIDAVIT

By Matt Schaff
Columnist g

 

University of Pittsburgh, Under
God

The 27th of September, the Year of
our Lord 2015 V

Dearest Mother and Father,

Have pride! Have joy! I’m proud

toreport that your humble son is -
’ on his way to completing the ﬁrst
leg of the OCC-IR, the Outside -

the Classroom Curriculum for
Indoctrination Reversal, with
only the highest honors. I never
knew stoning adulterers would
be so much ﬁm — and earn me so
many credits! '

* I know what you must be
thinking. “Didn’t I send my boy to
the University of Pittsburgh, Under
God for a quality ‘education,’ not to
squander his time on meaningless
add-ons?” Well, don’t worry, it’s not
just that all students, faculty and
staff are required to complete the
OCC-IR under penalty of ostracism.
On campus, _ the OCC-IR has
become much more than an add-
on: Indoctrination reversal is now a
way of life, and we’re all indubitably

better off for it, both in terms of
cultural purity and distance from
the scary, ﬁery depths of hell.
Ever since President Rick
Santorum, on his glorious
campaign to the high office in
2012, was kind enough to share his
divine revelation about the evils
pervading U.S. higher education,
we have been enlightened and, at
least for those of us lucky enough
to live in Oakland, allowed to
experience the everyday reality
of that enlightenment. We all
remember that day, Jan. 25, 2012,

when president_—to-be Santorumv

revealed the true goal of American
universities at that time: forcibly
“indoctrinating” America’s youth
to create a country ofjesus-hating,
baby—killing and evolution-touting
Mao worshippers (otherwise
known as Democrats, the “D” word
on campus). In order to counteract
this indisputable trend, President
Santorum arrived in office and
bravely, amid fanfare, charged the
ﬁrst-ever White House Pious Corps
with the holy task of reversing the
indoctrination of American twenty-
somethings.

To be honest, I’m glad Pitt ran
into such severe budget trouble
in 2013. If appropriation—cut—
intoxicated Gov. Tom Corbett

Santorum re-educatescampuses

hadn’t ﬁnally twisted the knife in

Pennsylvania universities’ bottom
line, it’s hard to say Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg would have accepted
the emergency presidential aid that
brought the Pious Corps to Pitt
(now Pitt—UG, of course). Because
of that serendipitous exchange of
borrowed dollars for obligatory
religio-social homogenization,

the Corps has provided a college

experience literally unavailable

anywhere else, routing out the

indoctrinators so we can think —

or not think — in peace.

The Pious Corps does the good
work on top of the Cathedral of
Wholesome Learning, operating
military-grade telescopes and
loudspeakers to enforce the new
campus order. You might remember
that the ﬂoors it occupies, the
35th and 36th, once housed the
“esteemed” University Honors
College. Well, after discovering a
hotbed of indoctrination brewing
in the UHC, the Corps quickly chose
to disband the heathen organization
last year, repudiating the UHC’s
encouragement of interdisciplinary
study, a practice deemed a direct
threat to the one—track—mindedness
necessary to complete the OCC-IR
and listen to Rick Satorum.

So let me tell you about my OCC-
IR involvement. As you recall, I came

I‘ to Pitt aspiring to be a biomedical

researcher, but you should know that
I’ve since come” around. That’s because
upon my arrival, the Corps returned
hundreds of millions of grant dollars
to the National Institutes of Health
after discovering that much of Pitt-
UG’s supposed “cutting-edge” research
relied on a hazy, unsubstantiated

theory devised solely to aid the

indoctrinators — “evolution.” Since

' all the labs have closed, I now earn

OCC—IR credit by conducting science
outreach, that is, taking the Santorum—
approved science of intelligent design

V. A .j'; to the destitute camps of unemployed

‘ V 5 professors on the outskirtsof town.
' Tomy surprise, the professors make
excellent students, especially when-
we bring canned beans. '

OCC—IR has enriched my

_ education in other exciting ways.Just

yesterday, I helped my fellow ﬁrst-
year “Young Fundamentalists” (I’m
about to become a “Values Patriot,”
and then, if I’m extra—dutiful, a
“Faith Crusader”) in implementing
President Santorum’s ingenious ABC

‘(Annihilate Birth'Control) initiative.

That is, with executive permission

our Pitt IDs, raided the Student Health

' ‘Service and Oakland pharmacies of

all kinds of birth control methods,
dumped our booty on Schenley Plaza
and put on Pittsburgh’s ﬁrst Great
Condom Bonﬁre — the dense smoke
of smoldering latex could kill cows
15 miles away, reminding us all of the
perils of defying God’s copulatory
will by not marrying our college
hookups. ‘

I’m also getting OCC—IR credit
by helping put together the most
honorable of nascent Pious Corps
programs, the SOID (“Sexual
Orientation Identiﬁcation Device”).
The Corps, under direction of
President Santorum, has decreed
that the student body should not be
indoctrinated with the notion that

-we could live happily among gay

people. The initial plan was simply
to waterboard students and then
place the orientation results at the
endof their Peoplesoft numbers
(like “—HOM” or .“—HET”. following
the 7-digit code). ’ I

While rewatching the tapes of
Santorumis 2012 campaign, we
learned a man can instantly become
homosexual by merely sitting on a
couch with another man, a revelation
which brought us back to the drawing

board — thousands of students%_
veering in and out of the gay state at ‘

a moment’s notice could conceivably
crashthe PeopleSof_t system.‘ -"C
In the revafrnped project, I’m_

contributing to a team of electrical ‘

engineering students to develop a
SOID system in which battery—powered
devices, sewn into the standard white
Pitt-UG uniforms, detect proximity
between SOIDs and emit sirens if
students of the same sex get too close
for too long. Our computer science
double majors are hoping to program
the siren to scream in the voice of
Secretary of State Michele Bachmann,

“The sanctity of marriage has been _

threatened!” or “Gather your rocks
and sizable stones!” or even better,
“Ignore what’s best and embrace your
darkest prejudices! Vote Santorum!”
Who knew I’d ever use“'technological
fundamentals to advance religious
fundamentalism — and get credit
for it? _

Oh, by the way, I heard the

. unfortunate news about my brother

Matthew. Let us pray his body
spontaneously rejects the large doses
of indoctrination he’ll be receiving at
“graduate school.” ’

COLUMN

Outsiders will :1

Andrew Kaback
Columnist

I love being told that I’m awesome. Yes, this
is an invitation to write a letter to the editor.
Unfortunately, I haven’t been feeling the
love lately in Pittsburgh. The City of Cham-
pions, Steel City, Da ’Burgh —— whatever you
want to call it — does not like me.

I’m an outsider. When I came to the 412,
I thought that I was just going to take some
classes and meet some hipsters. Although
the hipster part is certainly coming true,
that image of mine didn’t capture the whole
picture.

I didn’t know anything about Pittsburgh.
Even the Philadelphia kids understood that
it was OK for cars to not have a front license
plate. If there’s any lesson to learn about this
city, it’s that everyone is expected to know
everything about Pittsburgh. “No, we don’t
know how to pronounce the word creek, but
you have never heard of the world-famous
Monongahela Incline? Idiot.” -

So let me get it out there: I understand
that I can’t be accepted. I’ve been around
steel before and I sure love a good hill, but

none of that really matters. In reality, there
are pretty clear reasons that I can never
truly be a Pittsburgher. .

I can’t stand the Steelers. I hate the Steel-

_ ers. I seriously hate the Steelers. I’rn~sick of

hearing about their blue—collar work ethic:
They play football; they’re not laboring
in the factories. I’m sick of hearing about
their championships: They play football;
they’re not curing cancer. I’m sick of hearing
about their representation of Pittsburgh:
They play football; they’re not running for
mayor.

I only like two rivers. I think of myself
as a pretty outgoing guy, but three is just
one too many. Yes, it might have to do with
the fact that it extends into West Virginia,
but will the Monongahela River please step
up its game? The Allegheny River at least
has the name of the county in it, and the
Ohio River is a pretty big deal, but the Mon?
Can anyone outside of a 20—mile radius
even pronounce it? It just doesn’t appeal
to me. ‘

I think Andrew Carnegie was just an
OK guy. Three cheers for industrialism,
America is a powerhouse, blah blah blah.
Dial my number when you can tell me

about something that has ex‘ist‘edl.in'.thej
last half-century. Every city building and
its grandmother doesn’t have to be named

for the guy. Not to mention hewas kind of I

a jerk. It’s not like he was poping in for
tea with‘ his lowly workers. The museums
are great, but there has to be another hu-
man being that something can be named
for in this city. .
Pierogies are an average food. I have‘
nothing but respect for Eastern Europe-
an culinary inspiration, but, oh my gosh,
please give me something with a little bit
of spice. Are they really that enjoyable that
the Pittsburgh "Pirates, have to have a -race
of mascot pierogies? Does any other city in

America serve them with seemingly every— I

thing on the menu? , 4 A
I actually like baseball. Speaking of the
Pirates, can somebody please show them
how to have a winning season‘? I once had
a friend tell me that he loved the fact that
the Pirates were bad because it made the
tickets cheap enough for a poor college
student. I’m not that poor! I can pony up the
dough for a seat to at leastva .500 season.
PNC Park is absolutely beautiful and gives
a stunning view of Downtown, but I‘ only

ever be able to become truePittshurgers

know that because it was too painful to
actually watch the game and I had to look
at something else. -A

I enjoy going_both ways on streets. I
know that whoever designed the Pittsburgh
city grid was angry at the world, but can I
please drive where I need to go? We all miss
turns sometimes and some of us haven’t
updated our GPS in years,’but Pittsburgh

' seems cemented on ensuring that driving

mistakes can never‘ be "ﬁxed. “Why, sure
you need. togo right, the next 10 streets
are left—turn only!” And o_nce you ﬁnally
ﬁnd the street that works, it morphs into
a mile~long tunnel.  . is

; vI« love Pittsburgh.,I’.ve taken on my

"role as an EastEnder better than the BBC.

Whatever I do, though, somebody always
ﬁnds something to correct about my lack
of Pittsburghness. I never thought that the
only thing, standing in the way of me and
community was the ability to ﬁgure out

. what a “gumband” is.jSo I’m giving; up. I

might live here and I might loveit here, but
I will never be from Pittsburgh. You win,
Yinzers. You win. I r ""5 ‘

Festival gives director hand in workshopping play

WR|lTEN BY NATALIE BELL | PHOTOGRAPHS BY HUAILEI WANG

Christiana Molldrem directs “Pyscho and
Soma,” a play by Anna Gilchristfor the

s,_,New‘ Play Festival, an event that allows
students to showcase one act ofa play
they’ve written. Molldrem, a theatre and
performance masters student at Pitt,
has directed more than 10 plays and was
selected by theatre arts faculty member
Cathy George, who has served as an ad-
viserfor the production.

During thefall, writers and students
workshopped the plays currently showing
in thefestival. The Pitt News was able to
talk with Molldrem about her experiences
directing “Psycho and Soma.”

The Pitt News: Can you tell me what
the show is about?

Christiana Molldrem: “Pycho and
Soma” is about Grace  Grace is on the
eve of her graduation ceremony from
college, and she’s Valedictorian, so she’s
working on her speech that she’s going
to give and what she wants to say to all
these people she might not see again.
And while she’s thinking about that, her
imaginary lion shows up, and she suffers
from some psychosomatic symptoms 
and they take her through all the things
that started her psychosomatic symptoms
in the first place. And it deals with body
issues in relationships.

TPN: How was working with the1play—
wright as a director?

CM: It’s an interesting process, I re-
ally enjoyed the fall workshop period
because the play I’m working on, “Psy—
cho and Soma,” has had some revisions
since the fall. It’s interesting to see how
it gets shaped and how ‘things in the play
becomes clearer  [and how the play-
wright] works out the best way to tell
the story.

TPN: How did the workshops work?

CM: So, in the fall in the class, the
show had two weeks of workshop. So
there’s five shows, and we went through
them all week by week. There was a group
of students, and the directors would come
in as well — who aren’t necessarily the
people in the shows now — and they
would come in and play the roles.

TPN: What was your role in workshop-

ping?

CM: Well, one of the things that hap-
pened during the workshop is there’s this
great imaginary lion character. He’s a sort

of super ﬂamboyant magical lion, wh0’s
sort of the main character’s imaginary
friend. And he wasn’t super developed
in the beginning, so one of the things I
suggested in workshopping was to make
him sort of a ringmaster character who
moves the plot along  It has been very
useful during rehearsals to have that
character. ~ ‘ Z
 Anna, the playwright, she would
take recommendations from anyone. She
was very responsive and listened a lot
during the workshop period, which al-
lowed for these big changes in the script
very quickly. ‘

TPN: How has the play changed as
you directed?

CM: This particular script has been
fairly static as we’ve moved through the
rehearsal process. Stable would be a
better word than static  It’s a memory
play, so we go in and out of real time and
memory time. That’s been interesting to
deal with.

TPN: What have been some of the dif-
ficulties of directing this show?

CM: The difficulty is that —— [and] this
is for almost every play — you get into
a time crunch.  in the time crunch ofa
new script, sometimes you ﬁnd inconsis-
tencies  but there isn’t time to go back
and ﬁx it and deal with it. That’s the most
frustrating part of this process-is there
isn’t enough time to go back.

 [Also], we don’t have much of a bud-
get to put on the show. Normally, labs get
money from the theater department [and]
We’re splitting that between five shows.
We’re very much on shoestring budget.
It requires a certain amount of creativ-
ity to get around. You can’t do a certain
number of spotlights because one show
needs two. But I think that can be good
for the creative process. It forces you to

‘be more creative when you’re staging.

TPN: What have you learned from
working on this show?

CM: I’ve learned a little bit more for
this fest, better ways to sort it out and
be more organized, because it’s difﬁcult
coming in right off of break right after
last semester because we don’t get a very
long break. In the second weeks of pro-
ductions, We’re even more crammed for
time getting into studio space. So I have
some better ideas about how I would do
this differently in the future to ease this
process for everybody.

MEN’s "BASKETBALL

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team
"knew it missed Travon Wood-

a1l’s playmaking ability. But the
Panthers‘ never expected that
the Mountaineers would have to
double-team him. '
The point guard led the Pan-
thers to a72—66 win over the Moun-
taineers Monday nightat the West
Virginia University Coliseum. '

West Virginia’s Kevinjones ﬁn— .

ished with a double—double of 21
points and 13 rebounds for West
Virginia, but Woodall scored 24
points in his fourth game back
from abdominal and groin inju-
ries.

“I’m a creative point guard ﬁrst,
but at thesame time I’m a leader.
And if my team needs me to step
up and score some baskets, I try to

., , do that for them,” Woodall said. “A
' xii-lot-.ofsguys, theyire not keying on
me; They’»re expecting me to cre-
.s‘.’5'a:te.for-myeteam, but I was feeling
:.;aggressive.’’ . ~ ' -
 vWoodall’s- stellar play forced
" .the'Mountaineers to double him

at times in the second half, opening

; l.  Ashton Gibbs on the perimeter
 and Pitt’s forwards in the paint.

‘ I “When‘he’s got it going like

I that, -_it’s a plus_,’’ forward Nasir

SPORTS    

Robinson said. “We know he can
pass the ball, but when he’s passing
and scoring and hustling and play-
ing defense, that’s a plus.” ’

Jones,]abarie Hinds, Deniz Kili-
cli and Darryl Bryant all ﬁnished
with double-digit points for the
Mountaineers, but the Panthers
(14-9, 3-7 Big East) kept West Vir-
ginia’s young bench off the score-
board all night. The rest of the
team made two baskets.

West Virginia (15-8, 5-5 Big East)
has lost three straight games. '

“Personally, I want to punch
some stuff right now,” Kilicli said
after the game. “That’s how I feel.
I don’t want to do anything. I don’t
want to talk to anybody. It’s really
frustrating what’s going on right
now.”

West Virginia owned the glass at
both ends early, as Kilicli andjones
pulled down rebounds over Pitt’s
defense to ﬁnish second—chance
baskets. The Mountaineers opened

up a 17-9 lead while the Panthers

had a 5:53 scoreless span.

“We went to'a little bit different
offense: more patient, more aware
of what we’re trying to do,” Pitt
head coachjamie Dixon said. “ [We]
withstood their runearly, and that
was really a big point of emphasis
and something I’ was very proud of.
We talked about over—pressuring
and over—playing and didn’t handle

Pitt upsets West Virginia

it great early. But once we ﬁgured
what we wanted to do, we took care
of the ball the rest of the game.”

Kilicli andjones still had their
way down low, though, and West
Virginia ﬁnished with a slight edge
on the glass, -32-31.

“They did exactly what we were I
' afraid they might do,” Dixon said.

“They hurt us inside. They pound-
ed it inside, and they ran a lot of

great sets.”

With West Virginia stiﬂing Pitt’s
half-court offense, Gibbs ﬁnally
broke the scoreless streak with

' a fast—break layup with 8:12'left

before intermission. As poorly as
the Panthers shot early, the Moun-
taineers had a worse streak —- they
went more than seven minutes

. without a ﬁeld goal.

“We talked on defense,” Rob-
inson said. “We made them shoot
tough shots.”

In one stretch in the sloppy
ﬁrst half, Woodall tossed an er-
rant cross—court pass into the front
row, only to see Kevin Noreen do

the same at the other end on the '

next possession.

But Pitt —— more speciﬁcally,
Woodall —- warmed up on offense
and pulled even at 21 on a basket
by Woodall with 4:26 left in the
ﬁrst half. The junior point guard

cruit Steven Adams just doesn’t
understand what all the fuss is
about.

When Pitt fans ﬂocked to Am-
bridge High School on Sunday to
watch Adams play in the Pittsburgh
Basketball Club Legends Classic,
the 6-foot-11 center from New
Zealand was taken aback by the
amount of support. ' j

Adams has been an intriguing
prospect since. bursting onto the
national scene two .summers ago at
the Adidas Nations tournament in
Los Angeles, his ﬁrst time playing
in the U.S. ’

Since then,‘ he’s been widely
praised by basketball recruiting
experts and has shot up the rank-
ings from unknown to top ﬁve. Pitt
fans have anxiously waited to look

members"of the Oakland Zoo, as

well as a large media contingency,’

ﬂocked to Ambridge to see the cen-
ter in action. But Adams downplays

all the attention he’s been receiving 7

in the United States and said he
certainly doesn’t let the praise go
to his head.

“What I believe is, what hap-
pens on the court, stayson the
court,” he said. “[The media and
fans] can just watch me on videos

on the Internet. I just look at it like,

Even though he literally comes
from halfway around the world,
Adams said homesickness hasn’t

' been a problem for him at his new .

school. His teammates said he as-
similates into American culture
quite well, both on the court and
off.

“He’s pretty goofy, but he brings '
intensity,” Sam CassellJr., a senior 4

guard at Notre Dame Prep, said.
“He’s a hard worker.'He came in
here and told us we needed to work
harder.” ’ _
Adonis Filer, the team’s point
guard, said that Adams hasn’t had
much trouble adjusting to new
teammates and a new way of life.

expectations at Pitt

“He’s pretty good, socially,”
Filer said. “Sometimes he might
have a different word for some-
thing than we do, but we have good
conversations.” ,

Filer said the only thing Adam’s
needed to be consistently remind-
ed about was the goaltending rule
in U.S. basketball.

“We had to tell him there was
goaltending here,” Filer said.
“We’d be in practice, and he’d just
be blocking every shot we tried to
put up there.” ‘

Before taking the court on Sun-
day, Adams came to the Petersen

"A GRAIN or SAUL

 

Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

Marielle Berger is what’s wrong with

A sports.

She’s the kid on the playground

who tattles to a teacherwhen nobody —

passes her the ball. She’s the dad
who sits behind the coach’s bench

‘ and screams about getting his un-

skilled child in the game until ﬁnally

the coach cracks. She’s the one who”

has half the talent but knows all the
rules. . _

Well, maybe not half the talent;
but she certainly didn’t belong in
the six-woman ﬁnal of the Winter X
Games Aspen 2012 on Sunday, and

that’s exactly where she found her- .

self.

Berger was in the lead of a serni—
ﬁnal race before she and three other
skiers were involved in a crash that

slowed them dbwn considerably..

While they were laying face down in
the powder, Marte Gjefsen and Lan-
gely McNeal passed by to ﬁnish ﬁrst
and second in the heat, respectively,
and move on‘ to the ﬁnals.

But the French skier wasn’t go-

_. ing to be defeated. After the racewas
over, McNeal — an Idaho native and

the only racer represenﬁngthe U.S. in
that event — was climbing onto a snow
mobile to go back up the mountain
when someonegrabbed her and said
someone ﬁled a protest to disqualify
her because of her outﬁt.

Berger ﬁled the protest.

“I was really conﬁised because I
was wearing my mom’s ski pants,”
McNeal told ESPN.

Well, it wasn’t about McNeal’s
snow pants. It was about ahair tie

thatwas around the cuff of her boots.
McNeal was also wearing a band on
herthigh for fallen skier Sarah Burke,
who died Jan. 19 after an injury sus-
tained in the super pipejan. 10.
Originally, there was incredible
outrage from people who thought
her disqualiﬁcation was for Burke’s
band, but Scott Guglielmino, senior

, vice president of programming and

Global Xfor ESPN, released this state-
ment:

“Langely McNealwas notdisquali-
ﬁed for wearing a Sarah Burke band.
She was informedby our race director
that she was disqualiﬁed for wearing
an elastic band around each of her

pant cuffs thatwere not Sarahbands, .

butwere clearlyaviolation of the W'm-
ter X Games clothing rules.

“The WinterX Games has allowed
those Sarah tribute bands to be dis-
tributed from the athlete lounge and
has allowed athletes to wear the ‘Sarah
bands in competition throughout the
entire event.” V

While it makes italittle betterthat

' McNealwasn’t disqualiﬁed onbehalf

of her Burkebands, it still makes me
cringe to think this girl was disquali-
ﬁed from the ﬁnal. Doyou know how
many times Berger‘ must have seen
McNeal’s pants over the last week?
Do you know how many opportunities
she probably had on Sunday morning
to tell McNeal that her pants may have
been too tight?

“If someone had a problem with
my clothing, they should’ve said
something in training. I’ve been up
there all week,” McNeal told ESPN. “It
should be about skiing and not about
clothing and strategizmg some pro-
test that has nothing to do with it.”

What is wrongwith sports

Do you know how many seconds

Bergerﬁnished behind McNealinthe ’

ﬁnal? Fourteen. Do you know how
many seconds McNeal’s hairtie might

have shaved off of her ﬁnal time? A .

tenth-of a second. Tops.
McNeal even tried to follow the
rules, but suddenly they weren’t

convenient. She actually asked for a’

measurement on her pants because
she still believed she was skiing legally,
but they didn’t supply a measuring
tool and she had no wayto ﬁght the
protest. That was it.’She was done.
Then suddenly Berger — who had
ﬁnished fourtli — was magically cata-
puited to third place.‘ Fortimately for
her, the topthree of that heat qualiﬁed

‘ for the ﬁnal. Go ﬁgure.

DoIthinkBergerwould have pro-
tested if she had ﬁnished ﬁfth and

McNeal’s absence wouldn’t have given ‘

her berth to the semis? Absolutely
not. -
The worst part about this story

is when you understand McNeal’s ‘

story. , .
This was going to be her ﬁrst X
Games ﬁnal. She managed to get there
as the only skier for the United States.
She rocked gearfor Burke all week,
and her Facebook picture showed her
holding up writing on her palm that
says “I ski for Sarah.” ,

She was goingto be another Amer-
ican sports hero, but now she has no

; voice. She was left broken hearted

with nothing to show for  her work.
While Berger took her spot and didn’t
place in the ﬁnal — probably because
she didn’t belongthere — the X Games
crew made an offer to Langley: a spot

in the consolation ﬁnal. Her answer ’

was simple: “No thanks.” 3

It was Adams’ second time watch-
ing a'Pitt game in—person, but his
ﬁrst time seeir_1g'a Panthers vic-
tory. _

“That was fun. That was amaz-
ing,” Adams said. “It was quite in-

timidating because the [Oakland] '

Zoo is, like, crazy  I was like, ‘I

have to play in front of them next .

year?”’
Playing in New Zealand, Adams
was nothing short of an unknown

' commodity, an anonymous star in

a country that has produced only
two NBA players. While Adams
doesn’t necessarily shy away from

the glitz and glamour, he surely
doesn’t bask in it.
“I just ﬁnd it weird,” he said to a

_ throng of reporters on Sunday. “I’m

not used to this kind of thing. Usu-

ally it’s only like, two people or one A_
person with a note pad, but you’_ve

got cameras and microphones and
stuff, it’s crazy.”

His coach at N otre Dame Prep,
Ryan Hurd, explained that all of the
publicity is foreign to.Adams. _

“A lot of the kids today get an
opportunity to get accustomed
to it over time,” Hurd said. “He
walked off a plane and got slammed
in the face with_ cameras and ‘What
are you doing? What size is your
foot?”’ '

But Hurd — who calls Adams a
“ﬁin, fun kid” — said the newest

addition to his team at Notre Dame
Prep is dealing with the media and
publicity onslaught just ﬁne.

“He just has to try to wrestle ,

with all that and he’s doing a great
job of it,” Hurd said. “He’s not try-
ing to be anybody else. He’s just
trying to be Steven, and he’s ﬁne
with that.” ' ‘ » p "

Long after his Notre-Dame Prep

‘ squad secured the victory and most

of the reporters and fans headed for
the exits, Adams sat in the bleach-
ers getting his ankle tape removed
with his teammate, Filer.

Once the trainer ﬁnished un-
wrapping Adams’ gigantic feet,
Adams said to Filer, “Come on
man, let’s go.” I

Filer playfully replied, “Man, I
was waiting on you!” I

scored 13 of the Panthers’ ﬁnal 19
points in the ﬁrst half, including a
3-pointer at the buzzer.

“Coach Dixon knew I wanted
the ball,” Woodall said. “He called
the play that we call ‘ﬂat?’ I could
have pushed it to try to get atransi—
tion basket, but he told me to slow
down and call ‘ﬂat,’ and he let me
go out there and make a play.’’

’ . Woodall had 16 points at half-
time. ,

“He did everything, every-
thing,” Bryant said after the
game. “He found his teammates.
He scored the ball. He scored 16

7 points in the ﬁrst half. I don’t think

he’s ever scored 16 points on us,
period.” '

Pitt led at halftime 33-29'; and_
Woodall wasn’t done. He opened '

up the second half with a layup, ex-
tending the Panthers’ lead to six.
Two minutes later, Bryant
fouled‘ center.Dante Taylor as he
converted a layup, and West Vir-
ginia head coach Bob Huggins was
given a technical foul for arguing
the call. The technical incited
Mountaineer fans, who threw two
rally towels ‘and other objects on
the court during the delay.
Huggins claimed that he wasn’t
arguing the ball, but yelling at
guard Truck Bryant. 4

But Taylor converted the and-

up _a double-digit lead, 41-31, with

' 17:40 remaining. West Virginia, -‘

though, fedjones and Kilicli inside
and attacked the rim to pull back
within three with Woodall on the
bench. ~

As soon as Woodall re—éntered
the game with 10:30 to play, Lamar
Patterson found Gibbs for a crowd-
quieting layup to give Pitt a 50-45

‘ advantage. ' '
Gibbs ﬁnished with 15 points.

By Oliver Bateman
Columnist

Whether it’s President Barack Obama dur-

a ing the State of the Union address or your

- parents when you refuse to pay for the
food you ate out of their refrigerator, it

seems like everybody is talking about jobs _

nowadays. In spite of the constant chatter,
however, few people wind up landing these
coveted positions. But never fear, friends:
Over the course of the past decade that we
spent trying to shirk gainful employment
and malingering when actually employed,
we’ve devoted a lot of our downtime to
thinking about how to make a big splash
in the business world. Now that we’ve got
a bully pulpit like this one at our disposal,
we’re going to share some scalding—hot tips
and tricks with you.

,Let’s start with the truest of truisms:
“Dress for the job you want, not the job you
currently don’t have.” Sure, it sounds like
hackneyed advice, but see for yourself what
happens when you saunter into the local
Arby’s wearing a clean white tank top, ultra-
wide]NCO jeans, a snazzy wallet chain and
a ﬂat—brimmed baseball cap with its vari-

‘ ous holograms and stickers still in place.
Before you can say “Newt Gingrich,” you’ll
be teaching a crack squad of acne-riddled
teens how to shave, the roast beef anclmake
thecurly fries. That’s right ——. you’ll pass
GO and ‘ﬁnd yourself collecting a cool $200

a week‘ as an assistant manager!

Of course, not every employer hassuch
a rigorous on—site screening process” in
place. In some cases, you’re going to need to‘
email an coverletter and curriculum vitae to
a bunch of soulless HR drones. When writ~
ing a letter as important as this one, take

nothing for granted. Here’s a powerhouse

opener that’s sure to get them talking: V

Dear colleagues,‘

I want to let you know that OSCAR
BERKMAN is ready and willing to take
this job and run for a touchdown with it.
I am incredibly proactive and amazing at
many jobs and skills, as you will notice if
you skim and/or read OSCAR BERKMAN’s
CV (attached). OSCAR BERKMAN has what
you’re looking for in an‘ employee, friendl
acquaintance, boss and even son—in-law
(ﬁngers crossed). What I mean is that I have

- come to another turning point, a fork stuck

in the road. It’s something unpredictable,
but in the end it’s right: OSCAR BERKMAN
hopes you had the time of your life!

With dearest regards,

‘OSCAR BERKMAN

That’s a fantastic letter for a host of rea-
sons. First, the writer switched from ﬁrst to

third person.more or less at random, which

will keep readers on their toes. Second, he

mentioned his high levelof proactivity, a '

Graduates need to take
more chances, relocate

By Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

If I’ve learned anything from the one issue
of “Time” magazine that‘I’ve read in the
past six months, it’s that young people are
really exciting. I

We use the Internet! We routinely in-
corporate social networking into our daily
lives! We have no notion of privacy! Mark
Zuckerberg!

However, in atleast one important way,
young people are actually quite boring. It’s
not because we mainly use the Internet to
watch ﬁve straight hours of “True Blood.”

_ Nor is it because incorporating social net-

working often amounts to nothing more
than following Ashton Kutcher on Twit-
ter and sometimes saying #hashtag ironi-

Vcally.

Rather, it’s because we don’t move across
the country like we used to. Even when we’re
pursuing employment, the prospect of-work-
ing in a far—olf city is becoming increas-
ingly less enticing. According to census data,

only 2.4 percent of college graduates made a
long-distance relocation in 2010, a histori-
cally low rate.

This stasis can beextremely costly to new
graduates. After all, unless you’re graduating
in a technical ﬁeld where your fresh exper-
tise can beneﬁt an organization, your posi-
tion as a new entrant to the labor market is
often tenuous at best. With littlelexperience
besides a smattering of part—time work and
a course load designed mainly to encourage
broad critical thinking (I’m being generous
here), geographic mobility is possibly your
greatest asset when seeking employment.

After all, those experienced workers
often have two responsibilities that make
moving almost impossible: mortgages and
families. It has always been hard to pull little
Jimmy out of school to move away, but with
housing prices still in the tank and fami-
lies unable to unload, the advantage to the
mobile youth has never been greater. The
IMF ‘estimates that the inability of people
to move might increase unemployment by
up to 1.5 percent — a fraction prime for
new graduates.

Don’t be afraid of the ‘G’ word

-A- Kelan Lyons
Columnist

There is a word that students View with in-
creasing fear the closer they get to the end

,;;,of their college careers. This word is known,

to cause anxiety, rapid heartbeat, increased
blood pressure and feelings of discomfort.
The “g” word allows those on pre—med or
pre—law tracks to gloatnabout their upcoming
plans and forces those with English literature
and communications majors to hyperventi-

late and cry.

To those of you scared of this word, know
that it’s going to be OK. Understand that not
knowing with absolute certainty what you
want to do with your life when you get out
of Pitt is more than OK. By the end of this
column, maybe you will even be able to say
“graduation” without cringing and going
into the fetal position.

A large number of\upperclassmen are
petriﬁed of going into the real world because
they don’t know what they want to do with
their lives. Although the uncertainty is ter-

rifying, you’re not the only one. If you Google_

“graduating college and don’t know what
to do” you’ll encounter a long list of search
results conveying anxiety and terror at the
prospect of earning a degree and not know-
ing how to use it. Seniors, ask your friends

i now what they’re doing after May; even now,

injanuary, many will tell you that they have
no idea. This is not unusual and is nothing
to be ashamed of.

A world with no risk  
is fundamentally a
world with no gain.

So why aren’t college kids moving? One
reason is economic: With loads o_f debt and
fewer opportunities for even part—time work,
millions of graduates are forced to return
home. The prospect of free room and board
is too appealing to pass up.

Another reason is‘that many of the places
where college graduates could ﬁnd jobs aren’t
exactly ideal destinations. States like Ne-

V . braska, North Dakota and Vermont seem‘

backwater, especially to students who just

_ spent four years studying in incredibly di-

verse parts of the world.

A further, less commonly cited reason for

our immobility is a certain contentedness
with the status quo, even if it means having a
less—than—stellar j ob. As Kurt Andersen noted
in a December “Vanity Fair” article, young
people today are not drastically altering cul-
_ture like their predecessors. Aside from afew
techno1ogy—inspired exceptions, our clothes,

music and movie tastes have largely gone '

unchanged in the past 20 years. We have no
qualms with what’s being fed to us‘. If our

culture needs no changing, why drastically

upend our lives geographically?

Our generation’s aversion to change and
risk —— exhibited both in our higher savings
rates and our preference for having one job
rather than moving between multiple jobs
frequently —— is already well-documented.
Of co'urse,it’s possible that this aversion to
great change, either geographic or cultural,
might just be a healthy response to the ap-
parently dangerous risk-taking that occurred
before the recession. , ,

But considering that the ﬁnancial crash
occurred comparatively recently, our aver-
sion might come instead from our upbringing
—— from learning about the world through a
screen rather thanlcuts and scrapes, while
living in the most prosperous nation on earth

_ with largely unquestioned global power.

Either way, our cautiousness is troubling.
A world with no risk is fundamentally a world
with no gain. And with ample jobs available
in far-ﬂung states, those with the ﬁnancial
means and social freedom to move in search
of greener pastures have no excuse not to
roam.

It would be truly exciting, ultimately, to
be the generation not just of Twitter users,
but of Twitter users with jobs. I

comfortable with changing jobs. This career
ﬂexibility is helpful both because it allows
us more advantages in a sparsely populated

exposure to more occupations and helps us
to generate ideas about what we want to do
with our futures. .

Use this ﬂexibility to your advantage. Ap-

ply to programs like Americorps or Teach A ‘

have to rely on a large income to be happy.
Considering that you haven’t been living a life
of luxury in Oakland for the past three years,
the adjustment to earning money annually,
no matter how large or small, will not be
difficult. Working at a nonproﬁt organiza-
tion allows you to spend a few years helping
people. Enjoy the fact that you probably don’t
have a family to support at your emotionally
fulﬁlling j ob. .
Alternatively, you can go on the stereo-
typical backpacking trip across Europe in an
attempt to ﬁnd yourself. If you travel through
a country you particularly love, you could
join a program where you teach English to
child reﬁigees in their own countries. There
are programs in nations such as Thailand or
South Korea that pay you to teach children
English. These j obs are also morally reward-

Forget ‘one-size _fits_all’
resumé, start tailoring

Byjelf Ihaza
Staff Writer

We all have our shticks, butone wouldnit go
from day to day with all the same lines and

routines. Similarly, job applicants shouldn’t ,

try a “one-size ﬁts all” approach whentrying
to get hired.

One thing many potential applicants
overlook is how their resumé caters to each
speciﬁcjob they are applying for. A common
mistake job seekers make is to simply copy
and paste their resumé to send to a smor-
gasbord of would—be employers.

Pitt’s employment development special-
ist Deanjolin said not only is tailoring your
resumé for speciﬁc jobs important, but you
becomesigniﬁcantly less marketable to pc-
tentialemployers if you don’t specialize your
resumé. _

One of the ways traditionally used to
make a resumé job-speciﬁc is the old stand
by the objective statement. But many, like
Heidi McFerron, employment specialist in
the Pitt Career Development Ofﬁce, feel it’s
outdated. She said that objective statements
are obsolete and that that information istyp~
ically written in the cover letter instead.

Nonetheless, McFerron said thinking
about your objective and the exact reason
why you are applying fora j ob in a particular
company is very important. All job appli-
cants must remember that it is not what the
employer can do for you, but what you can
do for the company.

Organization of your resumé and the
details you choose to include in it make a

difference. Depending on your major, the 1

skills section can be a great way to let the
employer know of speciﬁc lab, research,
language or computer skills you have.

Forjolin, the more speciﬁc students are,
the better.

V “For example, most everyone assumes
people are knowledgeable of programs such
as Microsoft Office, but things like Adobe
Photoshop, Adobe InDesign or blogging
would all be good things to -mention if rel-

' evant to your intended ﬁe1d,”]olin said.

McFerron says to consider breaking your
experience into two separate sections. Stu-
dents often have relevant experiences in

ﬁelds they’re applying for, but list them ~

lower on their resumé in order to organize
events chronologically. McFerron suggests
having a “Related Experience” section where
you list the most pertinent information to
the job you are applying for, and then having
an “Additional Experience” category for less
important information.

And even those experiences that aren’t
directly relevant —' part—time jobs at fast-

, Randi Alu I Visual Editor
The perfect resumé is aesthetically
pleasing and highlights the best

' information.

food restaurants for example — can be ben-
eﬁcial on a resumé, says director of Pitt’s
public and professional writing program Pam
O’Brien. She said these experiences show
that the student is a hard worker, yet she
still advises separating this information from
more job-relevant experiences.

As with any presentation, it’s important
to know your audience. Creative ﬁelds such
as communications, theater, ﬁlm and writing
often encourage more of a creative approach
to a resumé. Applicants ‘can ‘feel free to ex-
plore more options with formatting, color
and even the method in which resumés are

sent. This, of course, should be practiced,

with a bit of caution. _ V
“While many employers in creative ﬁelds
would welcome a more innovative resumé
format, keep in mindthat with all industries,
it is important to research companies you
are applying to and know if this would be
appropriate or not.‘It is always safe to be
more conservative, especially if the com-

pany is corporate— or business-oriented.”

Jolin said.

O’Brien suggested that students go a step

further and schedule an informational in-
terview with companies they are interested
1n. .

“People love to talk about their jobs,”
O’Brien said, ‘And after an information in-
terview, they know who you are,- which is why
you’d send a resumé in the ﬁrst place.”

In addition to having a stellar resumé
that focuses on the particular job, O’Brien
said that students should worktirelessly
networking in their ﬁeld.’ ‘

‘‘Until you ﬁnd a full—time job, your full-
time job shouldbe ﬁnding a job,” O’Brien
said. I ‘

Moving home not the only option for graduates

-By Liz Keeney
Staﬁ” Writer

For a lot of seniors, inquirers want to know
what exactly they’ll be doing next year. But
it’s equally important for almost-graduates
to consider where they’ll be doing it.;

With the downturn in the economy and a

shrinkingob market, more and more gradu— V

ates have made the decision to move back

in with their parents to save money while '
they try to ﬁnd their footing. But for some

of us, that’s just not an option.

After four years of relative independence, a

moving back to your parent’s house might

. seem stiﬂing. For reasons ranging from your ,
dingy. Dave Matthews posters on your
bedroom walls to the fact that your parents"

room-could be just 10 steps away, movi-ng
homecan seem grim.  g in I

Whether it’s due to conﬂicting persone
alities, opportunities elsewhere, too small
a job market, or simply the horroriﬁc po-
tential for running into people you hated
from high school, there’s plenty of reasons
why you’d wantto avoid a return—ticket to
your hometown. But sometimes, it seems
like it’s the only option. What’s an does an
almost—grad to do? “

First, examine your situation. Pamela

O’Brien, the associate director of Pitt’s Pub-
lic and Professional Writing Program and an
administrator who helps students plan for
graduation, said each student’s situation
is different.

If you’re under mountains of student
debt, and expect to qualify for food stamps
with your ﬁrst year’s salary, it’s worth it to
consider moving home. But on the ﬂip side,
before making any decisions ﬁnal, make sure
to consider that moving to a new place could
provide job opportunities if you’re from a
small or economically depressed area. And
then there’s always grad school to consider.
So sit down and consider your situation.

If you ultimately do decide to move away
from- home, do your research. If the city
you’re looking at has a lot of jobs available,
try to ﬁnd out the cost of living of the city or

. " area you’re looking at the cost of living there
 is. Even if you do ﬁnd a great job, your basic
I expenses could still be too high.

Jenéee Sharon, a graduate from Pitt,
made sure to consider as many different fac-
tors as possible before deciding to go for her
graduate degree from American University’s
School of International Servicesystem.

“Ultimately, I chose SIS because of_its
conﬂict resolution program ‘and its location
in D.C. Foreign Policy recently ranked it
eighth for International Relations graduate
programs in the world. That said, although
living in D.C. is expensive, I believe that the

high cost of tuition/ living is worth it because
of everything that the city and SIS have to
offer,” she said. 
When trying to decide where to move,
one has you have to think outside the box._
While job market and cost of living are im-
portant factors to consider, they aren’t the
only ones. Be sure to see what else a city has
to offer. For instance, while your rent in a
certain city might be high, if the city has
good public transportation, you might be
able to get away with not having a car.
Interestingly, though Pittsburgh’ss been
rated as one of the most livable cities‘ in
the United States, O’Brien doesn’t think the
city lends itself particularly well to young
professionals. She cited cities like Austin,
Washington, D.C., and Chicago as better
alternatives. ' _
Another Pitt graduate, Levi Bupp, chose
to jump right into the job market instead of
heading to grad school.
“One early offer I got was to a co-op at
Advance Testing Company Inc. in Campbell
Hall, N.Y. The offer was for $11 per hour,
June through December.‘They pay for the
necessary certiﬁcations, and they provide
housing. I didn’t wantto wait until it was
too late, so I accepted,” he said. .

While not his ideal choice, Bupp took the
job because it provided housing and was a
good stepping stone.

you have tojbe ready to make some sacriﬁces.
Both Sharon and Bupp have roommates,
and Sharon works two jobs. They keep their
expenses low. You might ﬁnd that you have
to start at a low—paying job, and then ﬁnd a
second source of income on the side, like
waiting tables or bartending.

“When you’re getting started, you have to
do whatever you can to establish yourself.
You might not have an ideal job, you might

  Don’t mind the gap: Taking yearoff good for some grads

.4;

By Kirstin Kennedy
Staﬁ’ Writer

For some people, deciding between grad-
uate school and a career is cake.

Liam O’Loughlin graduated from the
University of Maryland, College Park and
immediately jumped over to Pitt to become

_ an English literature Ph.D. student. Despite

being happy about his decision to go straight
into the program, he’s seen how he’s become
tired. '

During his fall semester, while taking
many of his upper-level courses required
for graduation, he also had to take the GRE,
accumulate letters of recommendation, re-
vise his writing samples and tailor his stat-
ments to send to the 10 graduate programs
he applied to. r -

“It was like taking on another course load
of work,” he said.

For others, the challenge proves less
conquerable. _

O’Loughlin was fortunate enough to get
accepted into his top—choice schools right
away. But for many, even getting past the

application stage can be too daunting or =

time—consuming. For many students, the
undergraduate experience doesn’t allow
enough time to determine exactly what
they’d like to do — take out more loans to

afford continuing education or hop into the
job market. ' -

Taking an interim year or two after grad-
uating might make students fearful about
getting into agraduate program. But many
admissions advisors at Pitt say that a little
time off generally can’t hurt.

. “In the application process, there are no
positive or negative beneﬁts to taking time
off before applying to law school,” said Allie
Linsenmeyer, director of admission at the
Barco Law School. , ‘ ’

"Her advice spans beyond law‘ school
and can be applied to most graduate pro-
grams. '

“What I say to students is that if you are
ready to go to law school directly after your

‘‘If you arethihking .
you want a break
or that you want to
work for a While, you
know yourself best.”

undergrad, great — do ‘it. But if you are
thinking that you want a break or that you
want to worklfor a while, you know yourself
best. You need to do what you feel is right. In
the process of applying to law school, there
is no right or wrong. It is always what is best
for you,” she said. ‘

But taking time off doesn’t mean doing
nothing with your time. Graduates should
still keep in contact with professors, advi-
sors and department liaisons for letters of

recommendation as well as future network- -

ing and career purposes.

“The admissions board is comprised
of faculty members, so we like to see the
student in an academic way,” she said: “Stu-
dents need to pick a person who knows them
well and will provide detailed and valuable
information to the board. A big mistake
that I see is students who think it will be
advantageous to have apersonwith an im-
portant title write the letter of recommen-
dation,-but unless they are going to provide

something substantive about the student, ‘

we would‘ rather hear from someone who
knows them well.” _ '
_ If you don’t plan to keep in contact with

. the Pitt community, -O’Loughlin suggests

that you have a professor write a recommen-

dation'while you are still an undergraduate -

student. You can then put the letter on ﬁle
for whenever you ﬁnd a need for it. This

tactic is also beneﬁcial in ensuring that the
professor or adviser remembers you and
your work in their class. _
In addition, it’s helpful to build relation-
‘ ships with people from the school you’d one
day like to attend and get information on
the program there. Michelle Delie, coordi-
nator of graduate student services, advises
students to get the speciﬁc details that go
along with the application process of par-
ticular ﬁelds.

ate departments, there is a lot of variation
with speciﬁc program requirements,” she‘
said. “But it’s all about what the student
“would bring to the table. For instance, a
student looking to get an MFA will want to

' perfect their submissions in the time off ‘

from school. But what about something like
"anthropology? It is always important [for
the student] to be in direct contact with the

- department of interest. They will know the

exact requirements and preferences.”

O’Loughlin also advises that, when taking
time off, it is important to see how you react
to the break from schooling. '

If you are craving more knowledge in
your ﬁeld, constantly reading about it or
forming questions about it, graduate school
is something to keep working toward. If
not — well, there’s no harm in making it
mulitple interim years. I —

January 31, 2012 I The Pitt News I WWw_.pittneWs.com

By Brian Dollard
Staﬁ Writer

_ Claire Russ hardly envisionedher degree

in poetry from the University of Pittsburgh
leading to a career in public housing ac-
counting. - I '

“I never in a million years thought that I . A

would work for an accounting ﬁrm —— basi-

cally where I work now. I went from poetry

to, ‘What is the bottom line?”’ she said.
Like Russ, many college graduates ﬁnd

themselves working in ﬁeldsdownright

different from their original undergraduate
ﬁelds of study. Simply glancing through a
major-to-career lens, ﬁnding any connec-
tion seems impossible. But for. many, the
diversity of skills gained from their edu-

cation end up as advantages in the most -
A unlikely places. . A

In the summer of 2002, following he

graduation from Pitt with a degree in Eng-
- lish writing, poetry focus, Russ was pouring

 lattes at Starbucks.

“One day my dad said, ‘You have a de-

gree, why don’t you get a real job‘?’” Russ
said. . . V
After this direct, fatherly encourage-

ment, Russ was inﬂuenced by her father’s_

career in public housing.

“My dad got me an unpaid internship
as a leasing clerk for a nonproﬁt organiza-.-
tion in Philadelphia that provided housing

’ to individuals diagnosed with behavioral

health‘illnesses,f’ Russ said.

The_hectic_ environment and turnover’
within the organization presented an op-
portunity for Russ to demonstrateﬁa more
serious commitment to the profession.

“Real life happened, and a bunch of
managers quit.’ My boss told me, ‘I need

‘ you to buy a car, get your real estate license

and manage this program.’ And I did that,”
Russ said. '

She used her experience with“that job
to direct her toward the accounting aspect
of public housing, which eventually led to

' her current position as a manager for Asher

PHA Finance in Philadelphia. Although she
rarely writes poems for her j ob, Russ applies
key ideas from her studies to the presenta-
tion skills needed in her newjﬁeld. '

“You have to be engaging. You need to
get the most bang for your buck, because
you have such a ﬁnite.amount of time to
compress information. That part makes
sense to me from studying poetry,” Russ
explained. ' . . ‘

Because of how muchshe enjoyed study-
ing poetry, Russ can’t bring herself to re-
gret it as the focus of her undergraduate
major. 

“It was such _a gift to be able to study

what I wanted to study. I loved it, but under- 7

stood I would have to discover something
to do once I got to real life. I think most
people who study humanities have to level

with that. And a-positive attitude goes much
further than what comes after the comma
‘in your degree,”. Russ said.

Russ’s dilemma is not a new phenom-
enon. Decades prior, Sue Yenchko faced a
similar issue when she graduated in 1968
from Susquehanna University with a B.A.
in English literature.

“I had no clue what I coulddo with that
major,” Zenchko said. “But I picked, my ma-
jor not because I was looking for a job. I was
looking for the learning.”

After she searched the lackluster clas-
siﬁeds, a family friend helped her_land an
interview and, eventually, a job working
on a_19§8 political election campaign in
Harrisburg, Pa. 7

“I thought, ‘I guess I could do that for the
summer.’ At the time, I was not looking at
being connected with politics as a career.
But in fact it has been my career for 30 plus.
years,” Yenchko said. .

She credits the relationships built dur~'
ing thatsumrnertime campaign as impor-

tant assets, helping her get hired at a wide
spectrum of political jobs. She lists on her
resumé political jobs in 10 different issue

3%

areas, ranging from criminal justice to men- =

tal health to water. Yenchko currently works
for Pennsylvania American Water as the
director of government affairs.

“If you said connect the dots, you could
not do it,” Yenchko joked. “They do not
seem at all related but every single subject
area taught me things that I never would
have known if I did not work in them.” I
