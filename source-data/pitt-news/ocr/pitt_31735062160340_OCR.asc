Registrar Frank Reed reported
that some students add-dropped 32
times. and Dutton feels these
abuses should be eliminated.

“I do not want to charge the
add-drop fee in September,”
Dutton said in a meeting with
Student Government representa-
tives. “But I would like to keep the
idea /hanging and in controversy for

get it hanging out there.’
“Maybe you don’t agree with the

idea,” Dutton said. “But I don’t

think that I’m hurting anyone.”

Ira Dichter of Student Govern- -.

ment expressed his concern for the
cause of the add-drop problem
rather than effect.

“Why are the students add-
dropping?" Dichter asked. “The

system as part of the proposed
corporate underwriting of social
services.

LeBlanc affirmed unequivocally
that the mandate of authority which
a local government would require
in order to realize such goals would
originate from below, rather from
above.

“Only if we set up a socialist
democracy, in which the majority of
people democratically decide how
our economic resources shall be
used, only if the economic
dictatorship of the corporations is
replaced by the collective decision-
making of the people, can we begin
to solve the grave social problems
whichare ruining cities such as
Pittsburgh,” LeBlanc averred.

If a corporation balked in
complying with such legislation.
LeBlanc believes that with the
support of the majority which an
election would assure him, en-

pledged, “If elected. the Socialist
Workers Party would make ﬁghting
this, and all other attempts to
encroach upon the legal right to
abortion, a priority.”

She characterized her position on
the issue as a two-pronged sword: ,
free abortion and no-forced steriliz-
ation. “Free abortion clinics can
be made available in Pittsburgh
from the funds which our revamped
tax structure would provide.
Forced sterilization, of which some
instances have reported among
minorities, would be forbidden,"
she equivocated.

According to Adachi, black
people would be the beneficiaries
of a “crash program, funded by
corporate funds, to completely
rebuild the black community, to
build new housing, schools, hos-
pitals, recreation areas, and other
projects, and to provide jobs for all ,
black people who need them.”

° Campus Cops Finalize

August 37 Contract

The Campus Police (Local Union
No. 249) signed a contract
yesterday with the University.

The contract ﬁnalization came 25
days after representatives from
both sides reached a negotiated
agreement August 31. The Police
have been working without a
contract since that date.

Contract snags were hit when the
University submitted the typed
version of the agreement for the
Union’s signatures, but included
several variations from the original
agreement. Union representatives
refused the contract, returning it to
the University with their correc-
tions. .

Yesterday’s contract was signed
by the _University representatives

before being submitted to the
Police. Thus by signing the
document, the Union has ﬁnalized
the contract. ,

“It's just about what we agreed
upon," said Officer Robert
Kolesky, referring to the ﬁnal
contract version.

According to Kolesky, who
represented the Union during the
bargaining sessions, the University
has promised to “move full speed
ahead to get the retroactive pay
increases included in our next pay.
That would be tomorrow (Thurs-
day).“ Beneﬁts, including pay
increases, which had been agreed
to in the August 31 settlement,
have been withheld while the
contract remained unsigned.

Food, Energy Shortages

Humphrey Focuses on Domestic Crises

0

BY MICHAEL CLINTON

When the slightly graying gentleman entered the
half-empty Black Angus Restaurant last night, all
eyes turned in his direction. He smiled and waved at
the scattered couples, and made a special effort to
shake hands with each of them.

As he sat down and ordered a Budweiser, a" smiling
woman approached him for his autograph. Signing it
willingly, he wished her good luck and sipped at his
beer. .

“Things are going to get worse before they get any

better.” photo by Tylor. --

Settling back in his chair, he talked of his childhood
in South Dakota and his college days in Minnesota
where he studied pharmacy. He talked of how his
father's drug store was the center for political debate’
in his town, and how his love for the subject of
politics lured him into a career in public ofﬁce.

Recalling that big~decision in his life 27 years ago,
Hubert Horatio Humphrey, senator from Minnesota
and past candidate for president of the United States,
talked about conditions in America today. His casual
remarks accented the lecture he had just finished at
David Lawrence Hall. - .

“I'm going to talk about the food and energy-

shortage," remarked Humphrey as he began his
speech in the overcrowded auditorium. “Some of us’

can't understand these shortages." -he added. “but'

things are going to get worse, before they get any
better."

In his description, sometimes scary, of the world’s
food shortage, Humphrey told a responsive audience
how the U.S., the largest producer of the world’s,
food supply is now suffering a “critical, tight food
shortage." .

Humphrey blamed the situation on a steady rise in
population, fertilizer and past crop depletions, and
weather conditions which have been plaguing many
different areas around the world.

In summing up his comments on the food shortage,
he noted that a 5 per cent drop in the projected crop
this fall could precipitate a catastrophe resulting in
widespread starvation throughout the world.

Humphrey also spoke very candidly about the
energy shortage, which he reports, is also reaching
catastrophic proportions around the world. While
pointing out how we are all consuming much greater
quantities of energy each year, the Senator

Almost 200 people attended the

He accused the United States of

Editor’s Note: A day long
symposium sponsored by the
Women's Studies Program. was
held in the Student Union Tuesday.
Polymorph featured speakers on a
variety of topics. including Day
Care. Sexism in the Classroom,
Rape, and the Biology of Women.
Several films and discussion
workshops were also a major part
of the day. Because many of the
lectures ran concurrently the Pitt
News singled out this session to
report on.

BY DEBBIE POPP

The empty chairs outnumbered
those occupied by wonlren at the
workshop on rape. This perhaps is
indicative of one of the major
problems of rape. Few people
confront the issue until they
themselves or friends of theirs are
rape victims.

A low ten per cent of those
actually involved in the experience
report the incident to the police and
seek prosecution of the rapist.

The major reasons for this low
percentage, discussed at the
workshop were the conditioning of
women and the attitudes of society
in general as well as the attitudes
of the police, doctors, and courts.

The consensus was women are
trained from infancy to be passive
and docile. Women are instructed
to succumb to aggressive sexual
acts. Yet, when the woman
becomes a victim of rape. social

pressures keep her from reporting
the shame. The victim assumes the
guilt.

She questions herself, “Was it
my fault?" while society com-
ments. “A girl who gets in trouble

was asking for it." or “Nice girls"

don't get assaulted."

The ordeal of rape and the
psychological adjustment does not
end at the scene of the crime if the
woman choses to press for legal
action. Harassing questions and
snide innuendos often are the
result of reporting the incident to
the police.

One ofthe workshop participants
related the story of a friend of hers
who was raped one Friday night by
an assailant who crawled through a
jimmied window. She said the
police failed to acknowledge the
marks on the window. The rapist
returned on Sunday night for a
repeat performance.

Another participant said she
knew of a policeman who com-
mented to a rape victim that the
next time she better get some
bruises to prove she was forced.

Doctors as well as policemen
have been reported to ask
unrequired and embarrassing
questions about previous sexual
experiences.

Besides the personal abuse. a
victim may suffer from medical
personnel. The hospital is often
not equipped with gynecological
facilities. ln the past, rape victims
in the Pittsburgh area were sent to
Magee Hospital. But. since the
increase in rapes. Magee cannot
handle all the rape cases.

The woman is also subjected to a
personal attack with the court
system. She most often has to
prove her innocence before the
court will determine the guilt of the
offender.

Changing these social attitudes
and the conditioning toward sexual
crimes which deter women from
reporting and following through o11
court action is just one of the goals
of the Pittsburgh Action Against
Rape which directed the workshop

Student Health Insurance

Available Until Sept. 28   T

BY CATHY TUTTLE
Because of “heavy demands",
the date for purchasing student

licllllli insurance will be extended

until Friday. September 28.

Ronald Ecklcy, assistant director
of Student Health Services said
that since the initial deadline
September 14, many additional
students have requested the $56.16
Blue Cross/ Blue Shield insurance
policy. “Since the deadline
150-200 students have wanted to
enroll and we thought it just
wouldn’t be fair to shut them out.”

Students can sign up for the
policy from 9 to 5 Thursday and
Friday. at the Student Health
Center. 204 Brackenridge.

Eckley warned students to sign
up immediately. “After Friday

there will be no extensions. If
students presently enrolled in the

This extended deadline also
applies to students in the Law
School, even though they returned
to school later than other students.
Said Eckley, “We believe they
have had more than enough time to
enroll in the policy. It wouldn't be
fair to the other students if they
were given an additional extension.

“We expect to be negotiating for
a new insurance policy before the
end of this year." stated Eckley.
“We are interested in getting a
policy thatldoes the most good for
the students at the lowest cost.”

BY JOHN METCALFE

At out last meeting, I went on and on about the
First Amendment to the Constitution. The exercise
was so agreeable that I will go on to the Second

 W_lAmendment, even though it does not cover so much
’ “ ground, and has not been the tool of nearly as many

abuses and offenses as the First. 
This is not the beginning of a series; there are

e K some twenty-six- Amendments, and we could all be
P tired before the end of the exercise was ﬁnally

reached sometime next January.

I will stick to the subject, trying to show that this
Amendment is as likely to be perverted by small
groups in the advancement of their own narrow
interests as the First. The mechanics of this
perversion illuminate a useful tool for all who wish to
affect political processes. The text of the Second
Amendment follows:

“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the

l ’ security of a free State, the right of the people to keep

and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

That is the whole thing; there is not another word
It does not say: “Register criminals, not
gunsl”; it does not say: “Registration, then
Confiscation! ”; it does not even say: “Hitler came to
power after he took the Peoples’ guns.” Those
interpretations are not the product of the framers of

P 3 the Constitution or of the writers of the Amendment.

They, or phrases like them, have been invented by
the NRA, and sent by the millions to Senators and
Congressmen ,every time it seemed likely that

‘ . Congress would act to limit the use of handguns, or

the sale, or the manufacture, or he importation
thereof.

 Column and a Half

National Handgun Association. It purports to be an
association of sportsmen who have banded together
to protect their legitimate interests. They do this,
and they do it very well; in addition they defend
interests which are neither legitimate nor theirs.
When legislation threatens the wide-open
relationship between Americans and ﬁrearms,
instructions are issued to the faithful, and a great
rush of mail descends on every Congressman. The

«letters may be suspiciously similar in their wording,

but they are unanimous in their meaning: no thought
of gun control shall ever go on the become a law
restricting gun ownership. The Second Amendment
is regularly cited, or at least the second part of it.

Ilike to think that if] were a Senator, I would apply
the whole thing, and proceed to initiate legislation to
the effect that all persons who owned or wished to
own firearms must be members of a Militia,‘subject
to regular training and to mobilization in the event of
national emergency. It is a nice thought; it would
apply all of the Amendment to the gun nuts, and
would be something they would probably dislike. It
is a nice thought, but I would never do it; I would be
just as terrified by all that mail as the present crop of
congressional cowards. to

(Question: Have you ever held a strong opinion on
a political m‘atter?. How many times? ,

(Second question: Have you ever written to a
legislator? How many times?

(Compare your answers, with attention to the

mail so seriously.)

Any time a politican gets a letter, he can safely
assume that some greater number of people share
the opinion expressed, maybe five hundred of them.

(2) Course descriptions must be
published on a tri—mester basis.
Faculty members teaching courses
should be given the opportunity to
outline the course for the student
body. before the registration
period. In this way students can
more accurately select courses.

On a long term basis we propose
the advising system be
revamped in order to more fully
prepare the student for the world

A concerted effort must be made
by specific administrative offices to
implement needed changes in the
advising system. We recognize
these offices to be: the Office of

Shoes for Vief Orphans

BY MARC RUDOLPH

Shoe Shine Boys Day, a project
to raise funds for Vietnamese
orphans, will take place Saturday,
September 29. This is part of the
larger Shoe Shine Boys Project led
by Dick Hughes of Pittsburgh.

Dick Hughs

Money will be raised by

their chosen neighborhoods.
contributions will go directly to the
orphans.

Volunteers are asked to go to
Market Square Wednesday, Thurs-
day, or Friday evenings September
26, 27, or 28, between six and nine
p.m. to register. Registration fee is
$1. Volunteers will receive a “Help
Dick Hughes” T-shirt.

Hughes. a graduate of CMU and
Boston University, went to Vietnam
in 1968 as a free lance journalist.
While in Saigon he took eleven
orphans into his own home. By
1969 he had dropped journalism
and was devoting himself full-time
to the orphans.

The Shoe Shine Boys Project now
supports 170 Vietnamese orphans
in seven houses. staffed by 35
Vietnamese. There are five houses

in Saigon and two in Danong.

Hughes remains in Vietnam

saluted the sense of oneness which
is spreadeagling the community of
South Oakland. From the Irish
stew to the Lebanese dancers to the
African bongos, a burgeoning wave
of pageantry and ethnicity swept
like a deluge over all who were
present.

lt harkened ageless promises of a
‘melting pot’ of humanity. and
symbolically, deep. black pots
churning with hot, leafy greens
that complemented potato salad
and corn bread were in striking
evidence. But the forces of
neighborhood unity and redevelop-
ment that are being harnessed in
South Oakland delve far below the
surface of last weekend's fair.

Two and one half years ago, the
residents collaborated to form the
Community Human Services Cor-
poration, and the presence of that
association is now leaving an
indelible imprint on neighborhood
affairs.

The guidance and direction in the
Corporation rests principally in the
hands of several individuals:
Audrey Glenn, its President, Phil
Pappas and Dr. John Van Zaig, its
co-directors, and Tony Wieckow-
ski, co-ordinator of the fair itself.
Audrey Glenn enumerated some of
the programs which the corporation
has already implemented and
intends to initiate.

“Right now, we have established
free legal service for the commun-
ity. which is available 2 1/2 days
per week," she noted. “In
addition, we have launched college
preparatory courses for people in
the neighborhood, assumed re-
sponsibility for several youths
involved in delinquent activities,

such as movies. sewing, and bingo,
and generally tried to provide
services to the community that the
people expressed a desire for."
Glenn cited the Allegheny County
Department of Mental Health and

Retardation as the source for a-

portion of the funding and
expressed the hope that eventually
the Corporation could one day
ﬁnance its own programs. “Our
Board of Directors consists primar-
ily of neighborhood people,
common people, who have banded
together for the purpose of helping
one another,” she affirmed. “This
is why we exist."

Phil Pappas elaborated on other
forms of assistance which have
preoccupied the attentions of the
Corporation’s Lawn Street Center.
“Through joint initiative, we have
set up primary health care station,
schooling for pre-grade school
children, remedial reading and
English courses for adults with
deficiencies in these areas, and
knitting, ceramics, and music
classes,” Pappas brieﬂy outlined.
“Our neighborhood is trying to
re-define itself in terms of its needs
and priorities.

“Our most important goal is to get
people out of thier homes and
interacting with each other," he
asserted. “We've just got to start
caring again."

An illustrative instance of this
brotherly concern has been spot-
lighted in the Corporation's current
confrontation with none other than

Iceberg

Mayor Peter Flaherty and his
manipulation of Model Cities
funds. Dr. Van Zaig delineated the
central issues underlying the
community’s hostile stand against
the Mayor’s tactics.

“in South Oakland, 25 per cent of
the people are 55 or over, most of
which are elderly women living
alone in inadequate housing, or on
a ﬁxed income or limited budget, at
or below the poverty level,"Van
Zaig lamented. “Now the Mayor
has demanded that Model Cities
funds be used to resuscitate
neighborhoods rather than people.
The neighborhoods are evaluated

as to their priority for need on the "

basis of land values.

“It is well-known that land values
in the Hill District are lower than
anywhere else,” Van Zaig clari-
fied. “So the Mayor has decreed
that Model Cities funds be used

there and not here, even though, we j -

had been promised $100,000 for
adequate housing for the elderly in
South Oakland.”

Van Zaig avowed that the Mayor’s
policies will become self-fulﬁlling
prophecies due to the theory that
the poor tend to gravitate to the
poorest neighborhoods, if those are
the only neighborhoods receiving
assistance. “The city is not in the
business of solving property
problems," he charged. “Model
Cities funds. which are distinctly
separate from city funds. should be
used to help people."

Early in 1973 Robert Breer won the eleventh
Indepe_ndent Film Award for “his unique con-
tribution to the language of cinema in the ex-
ploration of the thresholds of rapid montage.”
From Monday, October 1 to Wednesday, October
3 Breerwill be in Pittsburgh to conduct a work-
shop in the essentials of animation. He will “de-
mystify” the whole process of single-frame ani-
mation by first showing a series of films to sup-
ply students with an historical background, and
second, by guiding and working with students‘
as they make films during the course of the
workshop. Breer will emphasize the “simplest,
freest, and most inexpensive methods of animat-
ing film images.” The workshop is aimed at be-
ginners but is so structured that advanced ani-
mators can pursue their own projects within the
format of the meetings. The class will meet each
evening from 7:30 to 10:30 p.m. at the Film
Makers’ Workshop in —-East Liberty. Write to

The citizenry of South Oakland
has risen in what is fast
approaching militant protest of the
Mayor’s interference in inner—city
restoration. Last week, Audrey
Glenn and 80 irate residents
stormed a Model Cities hearing,,
petitioning the board for its
signature to the gousing allocation.

Although the skirmish proved
fruitless, the Corporation plans to
continue its organized resistance to
City Hall edicts.

“Everyone’s got a share in this
community,” Tony Wieckowski
claimed. Wieckowski, a Pitt
graduate student, harbors no
illusions as to the dedication and
unsagging committment that the
struggle is going to consume from
all of South 0akIand’s resplendent
nationalities and cultures. “We
have the chance to shape our
future, and this fair is proof enough
that these people are willing to
work together.”

The Graduate ‘School of Business
has established a research program
to explore the role of corporations
in society. The program will also
determine the social and environ-
mental policies that an expanded
corporate role makes necessary.
The research is funded by a grant
from the General Electric Founda-
tion.

Dr. William C. Frederick, one of
the originators of the program,
explained that corporations have
been faulted by many groups for
not assuming a more socially
responsible position. “We’ll try to
take a systematic look at these
demands, and then figure out what
the costs will be of taking actions,
and of not taking action.”

One example of industry meeting
these demands, Frederick contin-
ued, is “the extending and opening
up of business opportunities for
blacks." The research team would
seek to establish equal treatment
for blacks within major corpora-
tions, as well as investigating
prospects of corporate support for
individual black businesses.

The researchers are presently
working on a social process audit
of two programs sponsored by a
major Pittsburgh corporation.

In one program, explained Donald
Wygal, a doctoral candidate
working with the research team,
“We will be looking at those things
which a corporation does which
affects society, but which are

tradionally overlooked in a financial
statement.”

“In this analysis of a corporation's
philanthropic contributions of.
money. resources, and executive
time to various Pittsburgh organi-
zations, we'll try to ascertain the
company's goals. and then look and
see. well. are they really getting
anything out of it?"

“lt's not enough for a corporation
to say that they will contribute to
the benefit of society. but that all
sides get their money's worth.”
frederick characterized the re-
searchers role mainly as that of

Frederick characterized the re-
searchers role mainly as that of
“consultant.” He stressed that
although the funding for the
program is from General Electric,
the grant was made with “no

strings attached.”

Trying to gauge the possible
influence of this research. Fred-
erick said. “When management

‘ asks you to come in. you have an

edge already. We will have some
influence if only because we have
studied the problem."

The research program will try to
determine three things: what
proportion of an industry's re-
sources should be devoted to social
objectives. the extent to which it
should be involved in these
objectives and some means of
measuring, appraising, and audit-
ing the impact of programs
designed to beneﬁt society.

“The need for this kind of
investigation." Frederick stressed,
“is deﬁnitely long-term. These
problems are not going to go
away."

turned down requests for aid from
Chile.

Nick Snyder, a representative of
the Washington-based Community
For Non-Violence, was the third
speaker to attack the U.S.
government. He maintained there
was a Chilean task force operating
from the White House which was
directly responsible for the engin-
eering of the coup. Snyder alleged
that this special group knew about
the pending take-over 40 hours
before it occurred.

He asked the audience to

Chairman of the Sub-committee on

pressing for hearings on the United
States involvement in Chilean
politics.

Representatives from the Pro-
gressive Labor Party, Young
Socialist Alliance and Communist
Party expressed their belief that
what happened in Chile could and
is happening in the United States.

A spokesman for the PLP said
the lesson to be learned from Chile
is that socialism must be installed
through force.

The digression of the discussion
led economics professor Dr. Daivd
Bramhall to compare the trend of
the comments to a funeral: “Some

The Buck Stops Here

Through the autumn sunshine, a
painting of a Pittsburgh night
scene caught my eye and I sat down
under a tree to study it. I was just
one of the many art enthusiasts
who came to the Scaife Arts and

Crafts Center last weekend for the

Center's Fair In The Park.

A lively voice_ interrupted my
train ofthought. “Y'know--I guess
things always have to -happen to me
‘cause they always turn out good in
the end." That was Harrietta
Forrest, a woman who has been
painting as long as she's been
breathing. Forrest talked to me as
she busily set up her paintings and
secured them in place.

“I’m coming on today with all
the happiness in my heart ’cause
today’s beautiful. But yesterday--I
would’ve given you yesterday for a

woman was robed in beautiful
oranges and red and was staring
into the distance with an air of
serenity and a sense of purpose.

A middle-aged couple passed by
and Ms. Forrest said to them, “The
buck stops here!" The couple
moved on and she sighed, “The
frustrations of Harrietta...and she
smiled all through."

I found Everette Sturgeon hiding
behind a wall of blooming plants.
“Why did I get into pot-making? I
make pots because I like plants.

‘Actually, you could say that making

a pot is like growing a plant. It’s
taking raw materials from the earth
and creating from that. A plant
grows from a seed. You don’t know
what form it’s going to take. It’s
the same with pots...they grow into
their own form.”

I crossed the fair grounds and
was stopped by a cardboard-and-
crayoned sign:“PLANTERS‘1l1l
THEY HANG* THEY STAND*
THEY GOT DRAINAGE* THEY
GOT BUILT IN SAUCERS*

THEY‘RE PURITY.“ .
Next to this booth was a

photography display--black-and-
white compositions of plants and
skies. and magnificent color
pictures of flowers. The photo-
grapher, Rich Froelich sat under a
huge straw hat

observing people as they looked at
his pictures. I sat down next to
Froelich and asked him what he
was trying to tell people through
his pictures.

“I want to give people a chance
to see things they don’t ordinarily
see. Who stops and looks at
ﬂowers and trees anymore? People
are so over-stimulated--television,
air conditioning, fast cars...I guess,
I would like people to slow down
and to see where they are. We’re
certainly goin’ nowhere now.”

“You know what you should do?
Go talk to the fat lady at the Greek
place. She’ll keep going for
hours.” I ventured over to the food
concessions and found the Greek
woman busily selling her food.

With my plate sagging under the
weight of pastitio, and a cup of
coffee, I went behind a vine-
covered wall and sat down to eat.
The strains of a conversation
drifted over the wall.

“Carol...” whined a little boy’s
voice.

“mmm?"

“Do we hafta carry back
everything you don’t sell?"

“Yes..."

“Ohhhh..."

“Unless we have a big bonﬁre."
I gulped the last of my coffee and
went home.

Purins Exhibit Reflects

Harmony in

BY AL CONANT

An exciting exhibition of paint-
ings opened at the Carnegie
museum of Art last Sunday. This is
the first solo exhibition in
Pittsburgh for Girts Purins, a
teacher of Design and Painting in
the department of Studio Arts,
University of Pittsburgh.

These paintings are, in a sense,
embodiments of the harmony of
natural environments. As I am a
student in Mr. Purin’s painting
class, l’ve had an opportunity to
both discuss and, to a limited
degree, practice his theories
first-hand; He teaches his classes
to be more observant as to how one
object within a setting affects
another; whether by color, size, or
For instance, what

object itself would be the area
outlining or silohuetteing that
object. When I followed this idea
through with paintings of in-class
settings I found that objects took on
more of their true character.

Six years ago Girts Purins
discovered this tendency in some of
his drawings of outdoor scenes and
its

refinement and development.

Noture

From these efforts has come an
exhibit of very developed and
harmonious paintings. Several of
the more graphic paintings in the
exhibition show how different
colors affect the dimensions of a
painting and how they can change
adjacent hues dramatically. The
more intricate paintings~incorpo-
rate this effect with a careful filling
and crossing of the depth and space
within a canvas. Multi-visual
Composition #1 includes both the
color interaction and depth
development.

Purins, in explaining his paint-
ings, told me that what he has tried
to accomplish is to capture the
Universal harmony of objects in

space, as they relate to each other.

The paintings are not simply
abstractions of natural settings,
they capture in a far larger way the
harmony of an environment.

Purin's paintings can be seen in
gallery “K" on the third floor of
the Carnegie Museum of Art--thru
Sunday, October 21st. The
museum hours are Sunday, noon to
S p.m., closed Mondays, Tuesday.
10 a.m. to 9 p.m., and open

folks, the Rolling Stones again
prove that it pays to be obnoxious
with Goats Head Soup (Rolling
Stones Records).

In this album, Mick Jagger
seems to be getting away from
those famed bluesy, drawn-out
numbers and is getting into the
harder stuff. “Coming Down
Again" and “Winter” are about
the only two left, the types of songs
you like to hear while staring out a
steamy windowiat the rain, with a
dixie cup of Southern Comfort.

“Angie,” the single released
before the album, is the last
bastion of the pained, mike-
gripping blues tailored to Jagger's
voice. Admittedly, as a vocalist
Mick leaves much to be desired for
pure tonal quality, per se. His
voice has more of a “spiritual"
quality that better expresses pure
emotion than pitch, which is just
perfect for “Angie" (and most
Stones’ numbers).

What the Stones, and Jagger,
have always done best is the kind of
taunting, almost evil (remember
“Sympathy For The Devil”?) hard
rock best exemplified on Goats
Head by “Dancing with Mr. D.”
The heavy beat is likely to send
those well-known shivers down
your spine, while getting the rest of
you to jerk by a divine (satanic?)
command. While coming close,
“Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heart-
breaker)” is a more lively number,
not nearly as heavy.

“Can You Hear The Music" is

And then there's the cut leading
to the warning on the album's
cover to carefully screen the record
before airplay, the cut that will
probably sell the album better than
any success of “Angie.” Mick and
Co. have learned well that the
“blue” sells better than the blues,
and so “Star Star” was born.

In order to prevent a few
premature coronaries from record
execs, the chorus line was changed
to “Star Bugger" (bet you heard
something else) and the last verse
(possibly libelous) is electronically
mangled to prevent recognition.
But even these few concessions to
American puritanism do not

Head football coach Johnny
Majors wants to make a few things
perfectly clear as he heads into
Saturday's clash with Northwest-
ern; One loss does not make a
season and one season doesn't
make a program.

Speaking at the weekly, Pitt

football luncheon, Majors reiter-

ated those two points so everybody
got the message.

“One or two games don't make a
season," Majors calmly stated,
“and one season doesn't make a
program. We’re here to build a
foundation for the future and what
we've got to do now is improve

every game.

Majors cited the fact that he saw
some bright spots in the Panthers’
performance against Baylor, after
viewing the game films. Quarter-
back Bill Daniels, tailback Tony
Dorsett and guard Reynold Stoner
received “plusses” from the head
coach.

But the defensive play of the
Cats did not please Majors, as well
as the Pittcore of receivers. The
Baylor Bears ran all over the
Panther defensive line and the Cats
had trouble hanging on to some key
passes. _

“We’re still looking for three
receivers to come to the top,"
Majors declared. “They've ‘had a
lot of work and they’re"going to get
more.” I

BY VINCE DI NARDO

In the Pitt coaches’ locker room last Saturday afternoon, Johnny
Majors was seeth-ing. His ‘team had just lost a ballgame to Baylor and
he was highly disappointed. When asked what his impression of the
game was, he quickly fired back, “what do you think my impression
was?” ‘

Majors was quick to blast his defensive unit, calling it the “softest”
thing he’s been around and, in the same breath, he emphatically called
the defeat “a team loss." It took a few quick drags on his just lit
cigarette to calm his nerves down a bit.

On two Saturday afternoons, the Pitt Panther has taken the field and »
they have yet to return with a triumph. For a man whose been billed as
“The Major Change In Pitt Football”; for the athletes who feel
anything less than winning to be desirable; for the fan that has just
arrived on the Pitt scene an 0-1-1 record is hardly anything to brag
about. '

“If an 0-1-1 record is a major change,” one might venture to ask,
“what was it like before?”

So, for these people, an apology is in order for writing this column.

But for folks like Dr. David Marangoni and Robin Lunn, this column
is designed to soothe. Marangoni is a Pitt graduate of 1943 and in his
34 years of loyalty, 25 of them have ended on the short end of the stick.
His only true moments of glory came in 1955 and ‘56, when Pitt made a
couple of Bowl trips, and in 1963, when the Cats were 9-1 and ranked
second in the nation.

Lunn has had it much worse, witnessing only 15 wins in 62 games.

These chaps and the thousands of others they represent have had
their college pride ground into the mud; their bodies cut open their
wounds salted. They have been shamed by 63-7 scores, spat upon by
1-10 records, and destroyed with total ineptitude. For these people,
the change in Pitt football has been satisfying--if not Major-—so far.

Get this: The Pitt football team has not shamed itself for two games
in a row! For two consecutive weeks. the Panthers have been in a
position to win ballgames until the final gun! Why that's almost
enough to make the nightmares stop. ,

“I’m not disappointed,” Doc Marangoni said. “We are improved.
We went down last week, but we were fighting until the end. It’s nice
to see that.” I

Lunn feels the same way. /

“I was led to expect a lot more," Robin said, “but.I was not
disappointed. You can tell they are a well coached team and they have
a lot of exciting ballplayers. They're definently a better team.”

Which brings us to Northwestern this weekend.

When they hit Dyche Stadium on Saturday afternoon, the Panthers
will need a victory in the worst way. It will be important in respect to

. what they do the rest of the year. But it is of utmost importance that

they do not share in the satisfaction of Marangoni and Lunn. Rather,
they'should come out seething like Majors.

Northwestern is beatable, but the team that wins will be the team
that wants it most.

The newfound pride as athletes should be enough to excite them for
Northwestern. Respect for Majors and staff and the willingness not to
lose should be enough to rile them. But if any further impetus should
be needed, the Doc Marangonis and the Rob Lunns will be there--
listening on the radio. 

:1: =1: * *

Bill Daniels was tabbed as the Pitt Panther of the week for his
performance in the Baylor game...Senior linebacker Rod Kirby won the
Bad Cat award-—that's the award given to the person who makes the
best hit. Kirby had expressed his desire for that award last
week....Dave Wannstedt was cited by Majors as the most improved
man on the team. Wannstedt played the best game on the offensive
line last week.

are are * *

The Hanneford circus scheduled for the Pitt Field House this
Saturday brought a bit of unexpected wit from basketball coach Buzz
Ridl. “I'll have the horses on the basketball floor this weekend, for
sure," Ridl mused. . '

Another apparent factor in the

loss to Baylor was the abscence of --

noseguard Gary Burley. Majors
used freshman Don Parrish and a
few others at the middle spot but

Baylor capitalized on Burley’s

injury.

“We missed Burley,” Majors
admitted. “That was one of the
determining factors. “We plan to
have more drills this week -and
concentrate on the middle of the
defense.” ~

Also speaking at the luncheon, via
was North-
western's head coach John Pont.
Pont took over the controls at
Northwestern last January and
stands 1-1 on the season so far.
The Wildcats opened the campaign
with a win over Michigan State but
were drubbed by Notre Dame last
Saturday.

“Our main concern is re-grouping
after Notre Dame,” Pont said.
“We came out of the game OK
physically.” ’

The news of Dorsett’s reputation
is now widespread and Pont had

jwords of praise for the frosh

tailback.

“I don’t think we’ve met a back so
far this year with his speed,” Pont
remarked.

Majors main concern in prepping
his squad for Saturday was the
necessity of a team effort,
something that the head coach did
not see last weekend.

“We didn't have 11 1 people
playing intensive football all game
long,” he remarked.

Kelcy Daviston, starting line-
backer, came with Majors to the

on the whole team. It doesn't take
just two people to do the job of
eleven men. It takes eleven."

Asked if he felt there was a feeling
of overconfidence amidst the Pitt
squad following -the tie with
Georgia, Daviston was frank and to
the point. ,

“To tell you the truth,» I thought
we were," Daviston softly stated.
“The team thought our 7-7 tie was
something. I had tears in my eyes

The athletic office has done its
utmost to maintain a solid
intramural program for the student
body, and have so far been
successful. The IM program has
been successful for years under the
quidance of Leo Bemis and Al

Dorsett Sets Sights On 1000 Yards

BY BART MACK
ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR
Tony Dorsett, Pitt’s phenomenal

freshman tailback, sat in front of
his locker following yesterday's
practice toweling himself dry.
Dorsett didn't take part in drills
due to a groin injury sustained in
last Saturday's Baylor game. It's
an injury that has the Pitt coaching
staff worried and Dorsett’s status
for this weekend's clash with
Northwestern slated is “question-
able." ' « I

Dorsett's playing status remains
as an unanswered question today
as even he doesn’t know if he'll be
ready to go on Saturday.

“I can’t stride out now or make
the cuts," Dorsett said, shaking his
head solemnly, “I just don’t
know."

If Dorsett isn’t ready, it will be a
great blow to the Pitt offense and
deterent to the freshman’s own
personal goal which he is rapidly
striding toward--a 1000 yard
season. '

So far Dorsett has galloped for
222 yards in two games in ,46
attempts, a 4.8 average per carry.
If he can stay healthy, it will be a
feat that some of the most
successful collegiate runners never
achieved.

But back » to the present.
Actually, Dorsett’s injury was not a
direct result of the action he saw
against Baylor. During the week
preceeding the game Dorsett said

that he could feel the injury
building up. It stems from running
on the Astro Turf surface at Pitt
Stadium, a particular dislike of
Dorsett's.

“It looks good, but it sure don’t
feel good,” he remarked. “The
more I run, the tighter I get. My
groin just can’t take it.”

As expected, Dorsett’s real
potential in the Pitt backﬁeld
hasn't begun to be realized. From
his tailback slot, he has run with
success both on the outside and up
the middle. Dorsett perfers taking
the ball the latter route, explaining
that most teams look for him to go
on the outside. _

“Besides, if teams start looking
for me all the time, then we can
fake to me into the line and pitch to
a fullback wide,” he stated.

Dorsett has been the backbone of I

Pitt’s running attack and on several
plays has just missed breaking off a
long run for a touchdown. His one
problem, admittedly, is that he has
fallen victim to too many arm
tackles around his calves, which
trip him up before he can get into
the open field.

“I just_got to start picking my
knees up more," he admitted.

For a freshman carrying such an
important load, Dorsett has re-
mained calm, cool and collected.
Coach Johnny Majors has tried to
keep the publicity down on his
freshman star fearing that too
much pressure might throw off his

concentration. Dorsett, the quiet
character that he is, doesn’t seem
affected one way or the other, on or
off the field.

“I’m just one of those quiet
dudes, you know,” he grinned
slyly. “I like to figure a person out
before I do anything else. Maybe
that’s why I don’t make friends so
easily. I

“I don’t pay too much attention
to all that publicity,” Dorsett

continued, “you just have to take it ~

in stride. Besides, that’s when I
feel I play my best--under
pressure.” ‘

Recently, Penn State's head
football coach Joe Paterno paid
Dorsett a compliment saying that
he could win seven ball games for
the Panthers. Dorsett disagrees
with the winningest (percentage
wise) coach in college football.

“I could help Pitt win seven
games,” Dorsett clarified, “but it’s
not going to be all me. We've got
the makings of a good team, we
just got to put it all together.

Dorsett has only seen the
endzone once in game action but
that fact has not brought the man
down on himself. He explained his
attitude saying, “I don't really
expect to score that much this year
‘cause we're rebuilding and all
that. But I'll take what I can get.”

What “he can get" will
probably be enough to delight Pitt
fans. What's more important, his
attitude is retlgctive of the new

BY RON SIEGEL

Three Pitt football coaches
walked into an'Oakland restaurant.
A waitress immediately rushed up
to one of them and screamed,
“Your Jackie Sherri1l,” virtually
ignoring the other two. Sherrill,
apparently already having made
plans for the evening, pointed to
defensive line coach Jim Dyar and

jglrawled, “No, he’s Jackie
Sherrill."

The waitress was not fooled. Jim
Dyar just doesn’t have that
reknown that Sherrill does, and his
wife, Nancy, probably prefers it
that way. When it comes to
coaching though, Jim Dyar takes a
back seat to nobody.

After a year on the taxi squad of
the Atlanta Falcons, Dyar decided
to become a coach. Being from
Enterprise, Alabama, Dyar knew
that the man he wanted to work for
was Johnny Majors, the pride of
Tennessee, and hero of the’ south.
So Dyar contacted Majors at Iowa

‘ State and asked him if he could be a
(’graduate assistant there.

Majors told Dyar to come up to
Ames, Iowa for nine months, but
said that he couldn’t use him in the
summer. Dyar, determined to

make Majors’ staff fulltime, packed E

up his wife and two sons and
moved to Iowa.

“I put in as much time as the
regular coaches did." recalled

Dyar as he brushed his hair in his
car mirror. ‘‘I was there at 7 in the
morning when they got there, and I
left with them at 9 at night.

“My father told me that if I did
all the little things, the things
nobody liked to do, it would reach a
point where if I missed a day
because I was sick or something,
they’d really miss me."

Well, the coaches must have
missed him, because Dyar has
been Majors defensive line coach
for the last four years.

One of Dyar’s assets is his
recruiting ability. While still a
graduate assistant at ISU; Dyar
recruited what became the Cyc-
lones’ top running back. It was
Dyar who brought Gary Burley to
Pitt.

With Pitt running a “50”
defense, Dyar coaches the defen-
sive tackles and the noseguard.
The defense is as new to him as it is
to the players, and Dyar promises
that it will improve every week. “I
guarantee it,” he smiled.

The absence of Burley was a big

M factor in the loss to Baylor last

Saturday. .
“It’s been good for us to lear
how important the linemen are,”
said Dyar. “When Burley comes
back, his job is going to be a lot

easier.” .
Dyar explained what happened
to his charges in the Baylor game:

FRIDAY is the last Day .. for. . .

“They whipped us physically. We
weren't ready mentally and the
team as a whole played poorly’. The
big difference, though, was our
inability to stop Baylor on third
down. If we would have stopped
either one of their 90+ yard drives,
itpwould have been a new ball
game. Burley really would have
helped us there.”

“Getting down on the players
isn’t the answer though,” said
Dyar. “We’re just going to do the
same things in practice that we did
the week before. Remember,
we've -only been running this
defense for two games. It's going
to take some time.”

Dyar lettered two years for Bill
Yeomen at the University of
Houston, playing defensive tackle
in addition to doing the place-
kicking. “You put it in the right
order,” said Dyar. “Coach
Yeoman didn’t think too highly of
placekickers. He believed it was
negative thinking to practice ﬁeld
goals, as he never thought his team
would be stopped short of a
touchdown. One time there wasn’t
enough room on the team bus, so I
had to ride on the equipment
truck.” l)yar’s record of four
three -pointers in one season is a
Houston record.

 Coaching With Majors Dyar’s Goal

When Carson Long, Pitt's highly

recruited freshman placekicker.-

found that Dyar was a kicker, there
immediately developed a friendly
rivalry between the two. Dyar
usually holds his own up until forty
yards out, but from there on, Long
will win.

Dyar helps Long with his kicking.
but will not tell him what to do.
“l’ll only suggest something to him
that he can’t see himself,”

emphasized Dyar. “The kid’s been

kicking all his life, how can any
coach tell him what to do? As far as
I'm concerned, Carson has his
doctor’s degree in kicking.”

Just as Johnny Majors’ name is
magic when it comes to recruiting
in the south, it also has helped form

the vigorous young staff that
shares his enthusiasim. In some
cases. such as Dyar’s. it has

brought outstanding talent to the
staff, even though Majors had
never met the man. Jim Dyar set
abut making Majors’ staff the same
way that Majors set about building
a program here at Pitt--a total
commitment.

Fred Koloc, director of the
Advising Center, agreed with
Dichter’s premise.

“All the efforts should now go to
getting the information to the
students,” Koloc said.

Dichter further maintained that
the add-drop is a basic right of
students.

“We’re still people and not
numbers; Add-drop seems to be a
necessary function right now” said
Dichter.

As a conclusion to the meeting,
Dutton, Rege Kaufman, and Bill
Kilson agreed to establish a task
force to investigate and find
solutions to the problem. Until a
solution is found the threat of the
fee will exist.

“Mr.

However, Dutton promised Stu-
dent Government that it was only a
threat, and in the end the fee would
not be collected.

Time Ging, of Student Govern-
ment. said “The idea of using a
threat stinks, but I agree with what
Dutton intended to accomplish,
(the elimination of waste and abuse
of the add-drop system.)



After attending the meeting, Bill‘;-J

Kilson of Black Action Society said,
Dutton seems to feel that
students here at Pitt can’t
understand the problems involved
with the present abuse of the
add-drop system and take the
necessary precautions to cut down.

“Withholding the last word on
whether the fee would be institu-
ted, as a threat looming over the
heads of students until after the
registration process is completed,
is not the solution.”
