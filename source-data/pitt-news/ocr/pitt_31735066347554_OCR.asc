“Fall Honors Program Possible Writers’ C0m‘9re"Ce5
    Slated for March 19-20

Monday, February 28, l977‘_ 

BY MAGGIE McKAY

A University Honors Program
(UHP) for the Oakland Campus
could be partially established by
‘the 1977 fall term, according to a
report recently issued by the
University’s Task Force on Honors
Programs. _ .
In the report to Provost Rhoten
Smith, the task force recommended
prompt action to establish honors
courses. sections and programs
within the University's academic
units. projecting that some could
be ready for the 1977 fall term with
full student recruitment targeted
for the 1978 fall term.

For planning purposes.’the task
force projects an enrollment of 200
students per class per year for a

total of 800 students in UHP per

ti,

(4?

year. with an initial expenditure of
$15,000. S T

The projected ﬁrst year opera-
tional budget -totals $88,459. ,

According to the report. funding
will not be much of a problem if the
instructional costs of the proposed
honors seminars and courses are
borne by the sponsoring academic
units.

Much of the program's expen-
ses. Task Force Chairman and
Associate Provost David Powers
said. may be offset bydonations
from outside the University. “The
presence _ of UHP might ' be
attractive to donors and wealthy
alumni. Private giving may go up
and this might offset incremental

costs. ‘

The program’. according to the
task force's report. will be open to
qualiﬁed undergraduates of the

College of Arts and Sciences and
the professional schools.

More than three-fourths of the
honors students will be from CAS,
predicted Powers.

“I don't believe General Studies
students will want to participate.
The degree of participation. by
pharmacy, nursing and other
schools can be as great as their
structure allows, but with 8,000

students plus. CAS has the
majority." Powers said.
The task force advised the

establishment of separate UHP

facilities’ in a central campus
location such as Bruce Hall. J
The facilities would include

offices for a UHP director, assistant
director and staff members as well
as seminar rooms, group study
rooms, a reading room, a- student-

faculty lounge or “coffee pot" and ‘

a computer room _containing a
dial-access computer terminal and a
mini-computer or super-calculator.

“We wish to avoid separation of

these students from the rest of the

. academic community. -All but one

or two courses each term will be
-with other students. However; we
believe there is much merit in
encouraging them to spend some
time together," _ the task force
report stated.

Such facilities are necessary.
according to Powers’. to provide a
suitable work and study environ-
ment for UHP students and staff
and to increase the sense of
community among them.

The task force also recommend-
ed the development of departmen-
tal honors programs independent
of, but parallel to. the proposed

UHF framework.

Each department will be encour-
aged to require its honors students
to “meet and maintain high
performance standards and com-
plete satisfactorily a research
projcct._ honors thesis or other
creative work,” the task force
report said.

UHP offerings will also be open
to qualiﬁed non-UHP students on a
peer approval basis, Powers said.

Although a task force on honors

‘admissions chaired by‘ Associate
Provost Donald Henderson will
soon present recommendations
concerning student recruitment
and admissions to the honors
program. the program task force
brieﬂy addressed the problem of
UHP requirements.

- “We expect that admission ‘to
UHP will be restrietedlto those
students who demonstrate academ-
ic abilities of a high order. interest
and motivation as assessed by'use
of high school and college grade
records. recommendations and
personal interviews-,"'the report
said. ~ ~

Retention in the UHP will
depend on the student meeting a
series of requirements including

-V completion of a minimum number

of UHP seminar and/or depart-
mental honorscourses per term or
per year of‘ participation in the
. program. The UHP student must
also complete all requirements of
his school and major and must
complete a research project or
honors thesis.
The program is not budgeting
any money for direct instruction.

The ﬁfth annual University of
Pittsburgh Writers’ Conference,
scheduled for March 19-20 in the
Student Union, will be the most
broad based and potentially the
. most effective writers’ conference
ever planned at Pitt. according to
Assistant Professor of English. Lee
Gutkind. the conference director.
Gutkind said this year's writers‘
conference. which is free with a Pitt
ID, is branching off into many
new directions and will offer more
students the opportunity to partici-

pate than conferences held in
previous years.
George Plimpton. author of

“Paper Lion." and the editor of the
“Paris Review." will be the main
speaker this year. He will be
accompanied by a host of other
guests. including Ramona Austin.
who will conduct a dramatic

presentation of her own work and‘_

the work of other African and
Afro-American poets; Ingrid Ben-
gis, author of “Combat in the
Erogenous Zone" and “I' Have
Come Here to Be Alone;" David
Ignatow, a world reknown poet,
who will both read from his own
work and discuss the work of
several Pitt student poets; and a
small press panel featuring Ann
Pride. a representative of the
feminist press; Tony Petrosky. a
representative of the literary press:
and John Crawford. a representa-
tive of the third world press.

‘‘I am especially proud of the

GEORGE PLIMPTON

small press panel." Gutkind said.
"it is the direct result of astudent
requesting input into the confer,-
ence to introduce Pittsburgh small‘
press publishers to the student.
community."

Gutkind said the conference will
also feature Laurie Colwin.
established short story writer and
novelist who is returning for her
second consecutive writers’ confer-
ence and the annual Selling What
You Write Panel. A which will
present a magazine editor. book
editor. literary agent and Plimpton.
A major publisher is also scheduled

to discuss how the publishing world ,

functions. particularly its -pressures
and challenges. »

Evaluation   Proposed for Beer Festival Vance Elected

BY DAN ROSENTHAL

Criticism from faculty and
students about the Student Union
Board's (SUB) Third Annual Beer
Festival held in early February will
help in evaluating the programto
improve it next year, according to
Bud Heaps. director of student
activities. _

People were concerned about the
overcrowded conditions. a lack of
control and cleanliness and espec-
ially the “free-for-all" atmosphere

- that prevailed in the Student Union

We might also set barrels out for

Forgive, Don't Forget

Iast January 24the Pitt News supported President Carter's blanket
pardonofVietnamdraftevaders. We saidthattopardonthemwasto
admitthatVietnamwasamistake,andtoconcedethiswastheﬁrststep
towardinsin-ingthat Vietnam did not happen again.

One month later, a closer look at the Carter plan reveals weaknesses.
The pardon does not cover 3,000 fugitives who failed to rejoin their
units, and some 250,000 men who received dishonorable discharges,
including 7.0% who failed to report to Vietnam and 2,000 who went
absent with leave (AWOL) in the combat zone.

The United States’ ignorance of the plight of these men is merely
tellingthelittle white liethat Vietnam was not that big of a mistake. For
the country to deceive itself about how deserving this second category of
men is of forgiveness will not prevent another Vietnam era, but instead
i'nsiires that sometn ': g similar will happen again.

of general anmesty can conjure up categories of men
whom they feel deserve no mercy. But a closer look at the Gls’ plight
quicklyrefutes opponents’ arguments and contributes stronger support
tothoseipfavorofgerieral anmesty. ' '

‘According to a Ford Foundation   the Presidentialclemency
Board, inorethan half of the AWOL offenders left because of pressing
familyorpersonalproblemsthathadlittletodowiththeir attitute
towardwar. Manywereteenagerswhohadenlistedtorim away from

-' troubles that did not disappear once they put on a uniform. One-third

were educationally disadvantaged and now have another strike against

tnem-—a bad discharge.

One-ﬁfth of the bad discharges (50,000) went to veterans ‘who
completed full tours of duty in Vietnam and could not adjust to military
life back inthe States. The American people owe these men more  a
discharge that deniesthem veterans’ beneﬁts including medical aid for

injuries suffered in Vietnam.

The strongest argument against anmesty—that it is unfair to those
who served-—wanes considerably when one realizes that only ﬁve
percent of America's young men eligible for the draft actually served in
Vietnam. These facts do nothing but point to the obvious truth that if
the country wants to clear its conscience once and for all of the Vietnam
era, it can do it only by forgiving these men, not forgetting them.

i Religious Pogroms—Shape of

BY DAN MULI-IOLLAND

From time immemorial. so-called
“civilized" men have persecuted
others who adhere to beliefs
different from their own. Often this
conduct has gone beyond mere
discrimination and harassment and
has entered the realm of outright
bloodshed. During the twentieth

' century, the most horrible example

of this was Hitler's wholesale

slaughter of the Jews. After his
downfall. the nations of the world
breathed a sigh of relief and looked
forward to a future free from such
depredations.

Unfortunately. it was not to be.
Up until now. religious persecution
was conﬁned largely to the nations
behind the Iron Curtain, the most
obvious cases being the Soviet
oppression of Russian Jewry and

the periodic executions of Christ-
ians in Red China and North
Vietnam. But very recently, the
scepter of religious persecution has
reared its ugly head in yet another
area of the world. and if current
signs can be correctly interpreted,
things are going to get worse before
they get better. I am speaking, of
course. about the recent develop-
ments in Africa. which is rapidly
re-earning its former title as “the

The ﬁrst inkling of this problem

became apparent about a year ago
when scattered reports began to
come out of Angola about
massacres of Portuguese missionar-
ies by various guerilla factions as
well as by the Cuban invaders and
their Soviet overlords. But the
current trend was not apparent until
just a few weeks ago when the South
African government announced its
intention to take action against the
Catholic Church. whose only crime
had been to open its school system
torchildren of all races in violation of
the government's segregational
policy. Such a blatant infringement-

Beginning in 1974. under the
supervision of Lt. Art Foreman.
Smith helped to train the Pitt
campus police and female faculty
and employes in the area of
self—defense.

"I knew a lot about defense."
Smith said. “and Art Foreman had
me come over to teach moves of
self-defense and how to approach
and apprehend a person and how to
do it in such a way as to not get
themselves hurt or damage the
other person.”

Smith has repea_ted the three- to
four-week courses several times
during the past two years and even
extended them to kids from the

poorer districts of Pittsburgh via
Pitt's Leisure Learning Program.
"Something like this is what they

need because they have all that
running out

energy

Smith said.

“l even have my girl. Debbie.
studying ju-jitsu."' he continued.
"She's coming along really well
and she's really into it mentally.
But I'd better watch out. because if
she gets too good..."

Simultaneous to his teaching.

Smith joined a number of martial

arts organi7.ations such as the
Tri-State Karate Association
(TSKA). the School of American
Martial Arts under Flewellen and
the AAU Karate Association. At
TSKA. Smith was tutored by Bill
Brice. a man very active in the
community and a former boxer
himself. ‘

Smith. who was elevated to a
brown belt in April. 1976. is no
stranger to competitive tourna-
ments. having captured close to 20
trophies and five AAU gold
medals. as well as defeating black
belt-holders on several occasions.
He is ranked number one in the
Lake Erie Association of Ohio and
Peniis_ylvania. which he will rep-
resent at Berkeley with pee wee
division contender Victor Kulcsar
of Wilkinsburg. In the past year
Smith has traveled to many other
tournaments throughout Pennsyl-
vania. Ohio and New Jersey.

Besides being a performer, Smith
is a big supporter of the martial
arts movement in the United
States. advocating the placement of
karate in the Olympic Games. next
to judo.

“The AAU is trying to put karate
into the Olympics for possibly 1980
or else l984." Smith said. “When
it comes to the world champion-
ships in judo. the United States is
still behind the Japanese and
Russians. As for karate. the
Americans will be stronger partici-
pants than in judo since it's more
like fighting—the Americans have
always been good in fighting.
especially boxing."

Karate. like most of the martial
arts. spread from the Orient to
other countries after World War ll.
It involves striking an opponent
with hands. elbows. feet and
knees. aiming the blows at such
sensitive areas as the throat or

v-;'..'"“ 9;."

temples. Experts can seriously
injure a person with a single blow
and shutter bricks (“Ah. that's
nothing—brcaking bricks." says
Sniith) and boards with their hands
or feet. But most persons skilled in
karate use it only for competition or
self-defense.

After its founding. karate was
developed to a higher degree by
the Okinawans during_the |(i00's.
after their government forbade
them to carry weapons. in the
early 1900's. the art was introduced
from Okinawa to Japan. where it is
most popular today.

Smith sees no reason the art
couldn't’ also become big in ‘the
U.S. “It doesn't matter about
age." he said. "If you put your
mind to it. you can do it. It doesn't
matter about your size. either. it
does something not only for the

‘physical body. but also the mental.

It really teaches you to become a
better person.

"Sometimes we get a little bit
banged around." Smith said of the
consequences involved in progress-
ing from the white to yellow. blue.
green. purple._ brown and black
belts. “but you learn to fall and
protect yourself. l could go and
jump out into the street and'not get
hurt at all."

Smith. along with Flewellen and
others. is presently working toward
the construction ofa temple in East

" Liberty to extend interest in the

martial arts. The building would
also include a small library.
day-care center and a gathering

~ place for senior citizens.,as well as

rooms for instruction.

“This temple will be the only one
of its kind in the nation." Smith
boasted. "It's going to give
something very cultural to Pitts-
burgh. lt‘s a place for people to
come together and say this is
theirs—a spiritual place———for all of
Pittsburgh." .

And All That Jazz

BY VAL HORNSTEIN

Saturday night Pitt rocked to the
sounds ofthe finest jazz this side of
Oakland. performed by the best
home town talent seen in a while.

The University of Pittsburgh
Jazz Ensemble and the Stanley
Turrentine Quintet performed at
Carnegie Music Hall in a sellout

concert. sponsored by Pitt Pro-
grammiiig.
Opening the show was the

23-member Pitt ensemble. The
band performed arrangements by
such jazz luminaries as Thad
Jones, Eddie Harris, Herbie
Hancock. as well as Turrentine.
All the arrangements were
performed under the coordination

At UP gallery

of director Nathan Davis. Nearly
every tune was characterized by
the big brass sound of the swing
era's big bands. Davis pushed the
ensemble forward. making it a
cohesive and well-integrated unit
with each section playing off and
complementing the others.

Particular standouts were inno-
vative. sophisticated bassist Hideo
Shimato. and Larry Williams. who
imitated Herbie Hancock's’ electric
guitar on “Chameleon." Dale
Fielder's dexterous alto sax solo
conjured ﬂeeting images of the
Birdman.

The best solo performance was
Bonnie Love singing the blues. Her
powerful emotive force was pro-
fessional and striking.

 

  K

The Stanley Turrentine Quintet
surprised the audience by playing
contemporary jazz-rock rather than
a standard jazz form.

The Quintet performed without
Turrentine for the introductory
jam. playing in and around each
other so cleanly that each change-
over was imperceptible except to
the most attuned and attentive jazz
car.

With the introduction of Turren-
tine. the group fell right into place
behind its leader. Turrentine's
music can best be described as
polished. professional. slick and
straight to the point. Turrentine
doesn't waste time; when he takes
to his horn he uses subtle phrasing

Pittto do Well In
7 Finals-Filled Week

BYJIMLEWIS ‘
Pitt is fortunate to have four teams (men’s swimming, women’s
swimming, men’s basketball and wrestling) capable of winning their
respective‘ tournaments next week on the way to the NCAA

 

championships.

That's right, four; because of impressive performances in
season-ending contests, all of the above teams proved they could come
through. _ ' i

The women tankers qualiﬁed 10 swimmers and -four divers for the
Eastern Regionals March 3, 4 and 5 at Delaware, in only seven meets,
including ﬁve record-breaking performances in an 89-42 smashing of
West Virginia. Kathy Stetler, Jenny Booker and Connie Heister will

_ lead the Pantherettes to a berth of the East’s top powers.

— -4  :4

The men's swimming team has been winning since day one of the
season. Jerry DeMuro and Tom Fatyol, as well as the rest of the squad,
have a great chance for a good performance at West Virginia March 3,_4
and 5, especially after an impressive 79-33 dunking of .helpless
Youngstown State.

The grapplers breezed through the beginning of their schedule until
injuries played havoc with the lineup. Despite the downfalls, Pitt
ﬁnished with an even 6-6 record after a 33-15 thumping of equally hurt
West Virginia. If everyone heals in time for the Eastern Wrestling
League tournament March,5 and 6 at Lock Haven, the Panthers could
qualify a few people for the 26-man quota sent to the NCAA ﬁnals.

lt’s been nothing but disappointment for the eager_s. A_6-20 record is J

nothing to be ecstatic over. But a 64-56 conquest of Duquesne minus the
services of leading rebounder Michael Rice and the normal point
output of Larry Harris instilled some hope into Pitt fans. It's only a
one-game elimination——-anything can happen. Remember that
one-point upset over Cincinnati?

So it could be an interesting week for Pitt sports. Who said athletes at
this University aren't as equal as those at other colleges?

Minor Sports One. . .

who is the best all-around athlete?

ABC attempted to" answer this question on “Superstars,” a Saturday
afternoon’ show which mixed sports and fun.

A hand-picked ﬁeld of athletes from a variety of sports competed in
different events—bicycling. boat rowing, bowling, obstacle courses,
weight-lifting—to see who was the best all-around athlete.

Guess who ‘won? No, not a football player, basketball player, or even
baseball player—but a soccer player. Kyle Rote, .Ir.. .a starter for the

Panthere ttes Pick Lock

BY MARK MURPHY

Paced by Kathy Paczkowski's l9
points and MiMi Senkowski’s l8.
the Pantherette basketball team.
defeated a deterlnined Lock Haven
State club. 77-72. in the Field
House Saturday afternoon.

Despite shooting only 29-77 front
the field. the Pantherettes led for
most ofthe game including a 36-34
edge at halftime. According to
Senkowski. Lock Haven was
tougher than anyone expected.

“We knew a little about them
going into the game." the junior
forward said. "Every game we go
illto we are well-prepared. but we
didn't expect very much fronl
them. Not taking anything away
from them. but .l thillk all our girls
were tired after the E/dinhoro game
(an 87-84 Pitt win).“

The win helps the Panthercttes
lll another lnlportzlllt respect. ‘Bids
for the regional tournament are due

soon and the club is looking for a
high rallking.

“Regional bids came out today
(Stlnday)."' said Senkowski. “I
think we will be invited but with
this will we might even be seeded.
If we get seeded high we have a
good dhance to do well."

One Lock Haven player almost
single-handcdly put a crimp into

. ally Pantherctte post season plans.

Maureen Brady. a 5-10 sophomore

from lselin. N.J.. burned the cords

for 30 points on l2 for 24 shooting.
“I doll't think she is even a -

_ regular player." Senkowski said of

Brady. "She didn't start and 1
don't think she is a normal
slartel'."

Brady picked up many of her 30
points on the fast break. because of
flaws in the Pantherette defense.

“One of our biggest weaknesses
is not picking up people on the,fast
break." Senkowski (stated. 'V‘Going

down the middle on the fast break
is where she (Brady) got many of
her points. When we came dowll
on the fast break no one picked her

The Pantherettes. now 18-6.

other weaknesses before their
season finale at Slippery Rock.

BY DAVE MCDONALD

COLUMBUS—Does anybody
really know what time it is? Ask the
members of Pitt’s distance medley
and two-mile relays—they ought to
know.

Pitt’s distance medley relay
captured first place at the Ohio
State relays Friday night with a time
of 9:55.2. The two-mile relay, with
two members of the distance
medley teams doing double time,
copped first-place honors Saturday
with a fast 7:37.5. Both squads
were awarded watches for winning.

The Panthers’ distance medley
relay led most of the race, with Rich
Moore starting off with a l:54.7
half-mile. Willie Walker, running

- the quarter-mile in 50.5, handed off

‘the baton to Nort McDonald, who
cruised through the three-quarter
mile in 3:02.8. But it was Mel Boyd
who put the watches on their wrists

I as he waited until the last lap for his

timely kick to beat the other milers
from Allegheny Community College
and Bowling Green. Boyd's time for
his mile was 4207.5.

The two-mile relay team’s time of
7:37.5 was one of the fastest Pitt
relay times in three years. The
biggest reason for the Panthers’
fine time was Tom Herrmann’s
excellent 1:52.] half-mile—his ﬁrst
half-mile run this year and his
fastest ever, lowering his best by
two full seconds.

I-Ierrmann attributed his personal
best to teamwork.

“I tried to take off on the third lap
so I could give Rich (Moore) the
biggest lead I could,” Herrmann
said after the race. “I hoped I
wouldn't die using these tactics, but

'  I

fortunately the other guy died and I
didn't.”

After Herrmann’s hand-off it was
clear sailing for Moore to anchor the
victory with a l:54.8 over a fading,
highly regarded Bowling Green
team. The first two Pitt runners
completing the relay were a tired
Mel Boyd (1:55.8; he ran the mile
and the two-mile the night before)
and Dan Dattilo (1:54.8). Dattilo
had tied his personal best the night
before in the half-mile with a 1255.5,
but the freshman decided to do
better the next day.

“I ﬁgured with the strength work
I've had that I could run with
anybody,” Dattilo explained. “I
went out and ran my own race and
my time benefited from it.”

After the relays, the Panthers’
roar was quieted down—except for
a mild growl by freshman Bud
Cooper, who placed fourth in the
600-yard run with a personal best of
l:12.8.

Pitt coach Mike Agostinella
thought the Panthers ended their
indoor season on an upswing. “We
finished the meet with the most
awards since I can remember,” he
boasted, “and more importantfv,
we set close to 10 personal bests.”

Included in"AgostineIla’s person-
al best list, but not placing in the
meet, were Mike Wallace and Jim
Munier in the shot put (49-6 and
48-4, respectively), Kevin Carpen-
ter in the mile relay (running a 49.2
on his leg of the race) and Ron‘
Wirick and Mark Studnicki in the
two-mile (9:01.0 and 9:12.0,
respectively). '

The Panthers have a week off
from organized practice, taking a
breather before the start of the
outdoor season in early April.

  Dayton Outweighs lcers

BY STEVE SYBERT

DAYTON, 0hio—Pitt goalie
Marty Bradley is looking for some
friends—especially some who play
defense in front of the shell-shocked
freshman, who turned in another
spectacular performance at Dayton
Saturday only to lose, 7-6.

“He had another excellent
game,” said head coach Len
Barcalow. “He was making some
saves that I thought only the Lord
could make."

Peppered with 40 shots, Bradley,
who could sue his defensemen for
non-support and win easily, came
up with one big save after another.
most of them with his lightning-
quiekiglove hand, but couldn't hold
off the Flyers (8-7-l) on their
second attempts.

“I bet you his 34 saves were n_ot
as hard as my 33,” said a worn out
Bradley after the game of his
counterpart Dave Spotts. “They
were one of the better teams we’ve
played this year. I can see why they
beat Ohio U., 9-5. '

“You can second guess and
second guess, say I should have
done this or should have done that,
but second guessing won’t do us
any good. At least it was 7-6 and not
7-4.”

As was the case in two other Pitt
losses—to the Philadelphia Junior
F lyers and Princeton—the Panthers
fell behind early, put on a desperate
rally, but fell short and ran out of
time. This time, Dayton scored
first, then built up a 5-2 lead by the
middle of the second period and
made it an uphill battle all the way
for the Panthers.

“It was the third time we ran out
of time,” Barcalow agreed. "“We

lost it in the first period. You can't‘
fiddle around in the first part of the
game. But our guys never quit.
never gave up. Now we can only get
ready for the next ones (two games
this weekend in Athens, Ohio,
versus Ohio UniVCl’5iI.\')."

It seemed the Pitt defense was
doing the fiddling and the Dayton
skaters found the tune to their
liking. Tom Dolan knocked in a
loose puck for an easy goal six
minutes into the game.'then caught
the Panthers out of position and
scored short-handed on a two-on-
onc after Bradley made the initial
save to make it 2-].

Tom Sherwin, who tallied a hat
trick for the 11-4-1 Panthers, scored
Pitt’s first goal by beating Spotts to
a loose puck, then decking and
shooting the puck by him.

With six minutesremaining in
the opening period, the Panthers
held a two-man advantage for 37
seconds and it took Bill Gedeon half
that time to capitalize by knocking
in Curt Hetz’s rebound on the power
play to tie the game. '

With six minutes remaining in
the opening period, the Panthers
held a two-tnan advantage for 37
seconds and it took Gedeon half
that time to capitalize bv knocking
in Curt Hetz's rebound on the
power play to tie thegame.

But the Flyers came back 30
seconds later for their second
short-handed goal of the contest.
Bill Bommarito .took off on a
breakaway down the right wing and
blasted a shot that Bradley, who
said the puck knuckleballed and
dropped a foot. juggled into the
net. *

The teams exchanged power play
goals five minutes apart in the

second period. Al Zangrilli fed
Sherwin a nice pass inside the
Dzt_\‘ton zone and the latter beat
Spotts on his glove side. Dayton
took over. however. for
remainder of the frame. skating
back up ice on three—on-two breaks
after missed chances by Pitt. The
Flyers were successful twice in that
manner and opened a 6-3 margin.

"Our guys were out of position."

Barcalow admitted. “We should
have gotten them away from the
front ofour net. I don't knowwhy.
but we seem to forget to do that."

Bradley opened the final period"
with two big glove saves to keep
Pitt in the game, but after Sherwin
fired in a power play goal from the
circle to Spotts‘ left. Dolan came
back with the eventual game-
winner (and his hat trick) five
minutes later after pitching his tent
in the Panthers‘ slot.

"If you don't skate and check.
you're going to have people
running at you continuously,"
Barcalow stressed.
