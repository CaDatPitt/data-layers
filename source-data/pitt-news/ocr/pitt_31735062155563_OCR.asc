SOPHS TO TAKE
EXAM sER1Es

In connection with a state-ygide
testing’ prografniin the colleges‘ ‘and’
universities of Pennsylvania, a se-.
ries of examinations is planned for
the sophomores during theweek of
May 5.‘

All sophomores of the University
and junior colleges, in the college,
business administration, education
and engineering schools, except
those co-operative engineering soph-
omores, must take these examina-
tions. . y

In the next two weeks sophomores
will ﬁll out information blanks in
their English classes. These blanks
will show the number of semesters
the student has studied wch sub-
ject to be tested and the number of
semesters which have elapsed since
the subject was studied. f

The average college grade and
the number of credit hours that the
student has spent on the subject in
college will also be noted. These
facts will be compared with the
grade made on the test in May.

Exam Measures Achievement

The purpose of the examinations
is to measure the achievement ‘of
the student at the end of the ﬁrst
half of his college career. The.
grades of the students made in this
University will be compared with
the results of the tests in other col-
leges of the state.

The examination will be ‘given un-
der the direction of the Pennsylva-
nia Study committee of the Univer-
sity. The committee is composed of
the following members: Dr. S. B.
Linhart, secretary of the University,
chairman; Dr. W. B. Jones, of the
division of research in higher educa-
tion; Dr. G.  Alderman, dean of
the school of education; Dr. J. W.

history; Dr. C. A. Buchner, head of
the’ department of secondary educa-
tion.

MONTGOMERY IN
 GRID TALKIE  

 

Many coaches and-newspapﬂermen I

have visualized a game between’ all-
American football teams. Their
hopes will be partially fulﬁlled as

a movie in which such a contestwill

» Ray Montgomery, fall-America__n
guard, left for Hollywood, Cal., Fri-
day, to take part in the movie... He
will return to Pitt in about a month.
Montgompry was and is very ac-
tive in Pitt affairs. He played foot-
ball three years, being all-American
last year. He took part in: two
Tournament of Roses games and

was an assistant coach this year in,-
However, he does’

spring training.

not limit his athletic activities to

the gridiron. He received his? let-
ter in basketball last year, and .he
is a track man in the capacity ..of a
hammer - thrower. Furthermore,
Monty is president ‘of the senior
class in the Business Ad. school‘ and
the representative of that school on
the senior»; cabinet. In addition to

-this-, he was scheduled for an act

with Edwards in the coming Cap
and Gown production. He is a. mem-
ber of Delta Tau Delta, men's so-
cial fraternity, and O. D. K.

"Ray has made. many friends here
and abroad. Two years,.ago when
he was on the west coast for the
tournament game, he made the “.ac.-

met Anita Page and danced with

wish you were a football player?

Mike Getto, all-American tackle, f

was also chosen to act in the game
for the 1928; aggregation. He is a
member of Phi- Kappa. Mike had
an unusual record as a Panther
football player. He _was nothing
but a substitute in his first two
years and an all-American choice at

Pitt should be‘ proud of its good

Gow Stresses Parental
Obligations At~Reception

“The University’s efforts will be
of little avail without the parents,
on their part, fulﬁlling their respon-
sibilities,” said J. Steele Gow, dean
of administration, in addressing the

men at Soldiei-s’.Memorial Hall, last
Friday, at the Chancellor’s recep-

ion. V ' —

ities, appealed to the parents to dis-

play an intelligent interest in their

sons’, and daughters’ scholastic. activ-
ities, to encourage them to excell in
such activities,_to relieve them of all
unnecessary worry, to supply’. them
with proper facilities for study,.and-
to set good examples for them. to

change in the election of school as-

members. Elections for these oﬂices
will be held at the regular spring
elections on May 16. . S

. Dissatisﬁed with the recent ac-
tion taken by council providing that
present staff heads shall serve in an
advisory capacity in the selection of
their successors, Emanuel Fishkin,
Bus. Ad. ’31, put through two mo-
tions aimed at the regulation of stu-
dent publications. .

_ These motions provide that the se-
lection"of the publications board for
editors and business managers of
publications be submitted to Coun-
cil‘ for approval and that the heads
can be removed from office only by
a two-thirds vote of student coun-
cil. Any counpillor, council adviser
or member of the‘ publication board
can initiate this action. Council
passed these measures more as a
test of its own power than as deﬁ-
nite piece of legislation, several
members stated after the meeting.

zzvgvvvzvr Would Avvvvve of The  
Gowns In ‘lwqnhattdn Preferred ”

By MARGARET REINIIEBB.  V

Yes and positively, girls, long
dresses are not it for sports. jYou
should see those new prints-—-you
know how good prints are this
s’pring——the Cap and Gown chorus
wears in one of the out-door scenes
of the show. The pleated silk things
just ﬂip about their knees, and, we
suppose, will be keeping time to
those cocky white trimmed scarfs
that dangle around the neckline,

But before you snip oﬁ a foot or
so of all your dresses, wait and see
what’s being worn for afternoon and

‘evening as Cap and Gown .decre_es.
9 as Peggy ’
“lady”-de-.
murely hides his lower appendages,

Eddie Bonner, Col. ’31
0’Donnell——-the leading

with printed net that cascades down
to the boards of the ‘stage,’ while
again‘ he flaunts , his calfs in a
tailored crepe thing. In the end,
though, he compromises. The ‘taf-
fetta. gown he wears in the ﬁnale
blends from delicate pink through
shades of red and chartreuse to bril-
liant greens at the end of a four-
yard’ train. But in the front he
rivals a. Mack Sennet bathing beauty
with his short tights.

Elaborate detail, unusual late
styles for both‘ principals and

choruses make the costuming .ofd£3apj

and Gown this year equal to the of
any professional musical revue
straight from New York‘. Mr. Mar-
latt, director, personally designed
the trunks and boxes full of dresses
and accessorieswhich he uses for

his Junior League productions ._a_.n_clV

and-Gown had all of its dresses made
especially for each show; then dis-
carded them. ‘

tafetta.s—or sma.rt—-close
wool berets with immense ﬂuffy
pom—p'oms on top for their tricky‘
little sweater and skirt outﬁt; ‘ or

quaintV-curled white wigs for green '-

and for silver and green afternoon
gowns against a silver background;
or sophisticated-——bla.ck ﬂowers art-
fully tacked on the brims of ﬂoppy

white hats that go with tiered not A

dresses. Every accessory, from

blond shoes for the light dresses to .
long’ red gloves for the navy blue

and ‘white costumes, is ready.

V Extreme Models

Of course the principals will show
extremes of the mode in cut and de-
sign and materials. Alex Kann in a

s1inky:b1a_.ck transparent velvet lined - O
with red will bring gasps from the
women, while the “lady” who poses - '

for ‘a. “ﬂash” boudoir scene in a
backless pink and white particle of

lingerie will bring sighs of regret’

from many a man inthe audience.

Opera wraps in --the bri htest of V
colors will temporarily Vhi e the ex- '

‘creme decollete Well ﬁtted evening
gowns. In this class we nominate
the beaded tulle and the black lace
as the lowest cut ones‘. Johnny
Harpster as Mrs. McCracken will be
exposed. Flowered moire, long and
close ﬁtting, makes Gibby Mothers-
baugh as Goldie the most demure
lady of the show.

Incidently, Mr. Marlatt tells us
that the ideas for most of the clothes
for his shows come from Paris.
Every year, between productions, he
go_c._s.. to the openings. of the French

designers. V Perhaps -thaty accounts f

for the style ariltl originality of the
costumes Cap and Gown will dance
and sing in this year. .

Mrs. Algeo, who for. the last half.  .

dozen years has been transforming
hairy chested, bulgy armed

midst of ﬁttings. Her major prob-
lem is. altering frocks that come in
size sixteen to ﬁt ~ men who come
mostly inrsize twenty-two. Results
will probably’ be close.

Tennis practice starts . olilcially
Tuesday, April 22, the ﬁrst day af-
ter Easter vacation. All -of last
year’s varsity and freshman teams
are requested to report at the sta-
dium promptly. Others desiring to

5 stant Coach Hagan will have a
man-sized job on his hands in whip-
ing his team into shape for the
rst match with Allegheny» College,

. Friday, April 25.

 

One of :.*Ath[eg funniest- incidents

‘which I can remember a-Andwhich is

always recalled to my mind whenul
think of tennis. occurred at West-
chester, Biltmore, last summer. Ta-
mio‘ Abe, the Japanese: Davis Cup
star, and .Vrnyself, were engaging in
a heated encounter. -It‘ was grow-
ing fairly - ‘dark an‘d;Tamio_ ‘could’
hardly see the balls because they
were “swabbed” with green from
the heavy‘. turf. Tamio asked for
new balls but the umpire said . we
must ﬁnish. the; -setbefore we -could
get new balls. Abe a«giain*plAeaded
