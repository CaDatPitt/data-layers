c On Satur_day.morning there will be
an attractive tennis match .between
VPitt and another school. The name
of this school will be withheld for the

’ time being until the ﬁnal arrange-

ments have been completed. Gradu-
ate Manager" K. E. Davis is handling

that will bring everyone. out to wach
the contest. ’ ’ . ‘ "
‘ During the afternoon there will be
a push-ball game between two schools
~ ofgthe University. Push ball- is a
game rather new to the" people‘ V.of
Pittsburgh and will furnish an inter-
esting feature for everyone. There
will also be a‘ farcical football game
.between the“ ‘V‘Cake-Eaters”_and the
‘fFinale-Hoppers.” . This " will , be "‘ a
farce -from the- word""“go.” The." par-’
ticipants will, be costumed in appro-

\

played in ﬁve minute quarters.

V The ‘most attractive event sched-
uled for Saturday afternoon will be
the inter-fraternity sweepstakes’
races. There ‘-will be three ﬁne cups

and it is expected that competition
will be verykeen. Each fraternity
entering will furnish a “pus_hmob"—.ile,”
to be driven, by one occupant in the
dr_iver’s seat and pushed by one man.
The course will be in the park-near
the University so that all may be able_
to watch the races. In the near fu-
ture general speciﬁcations for the
cars will be sent to each fraternity
in order that theymay have ample
time . for the construction of their

‘‘pushmobile.’’ . ~ ‘ . 4
The most important part of the pro-
gram will take place on Saturday

Porter estate. Never -beforefhas the
University- had a suitable place to
accommodate a gathering of thou-
sands, but with the beautiful Porter
estate being thrown open, there will
be ample room for all. The‘ commit-V
tee will have Va ‘stage erected, from‘
which skits._willV be Vgivenby various

studen"t*V organizations, as well" as
‘ some acts by professional vaudeville
talent. V " ' '

According to the plans worked out
by the committee ‘and approved by
the administration, a button -will be
sold to— each student in order" to 11
nance PITT WEEK. The success of
-PITT WEEK will depend almost en-
tirely upon the [response of the-~stu-
dents to this part of the program." The"
committee has worked out a budget
which may be realized in -full, provid-

of ‘these buttons at one dollar each.
Chairman “Dick” Ho1brook’wi"shes
to announce that the funds raised by
this drive shall be used toﬁnancelall"
of the expV -ses incident to PITT

of the dance at the Duquesne Garden.
If more money is received than‘ is
necessary for the program as now out-

-basket ball banquet .. to. be-» given
Ma.rch_;l‘-3. - .- '” 

The ﬁrst basket ball banquet was
given last year under ‘the auspices of
the Y. M‘. -10. A. It was. successful
in -every respect and the ,Y." M.» C. A.
feels that it "will receive ample stu-
dent “support in making the banquet
an annual affair. At the banquet, the
basket ball captain; for next _yea_r
will be elected and it will resemble
the annual football —banquet' in ‘every
respect with the addition of as many
features. as the committee‘ can ar-
range. _, S

Last .year’s ‘banquet was instigated
largely by Herb. Mc.Cracken who
emphasized the facts thatvwhile the
basket ‘ball team requires as much
work and as much hard training as
any of the other teams, it receives
no suitable reward corresponding to
the annual football banquet. —

men who excel in remembering have
.little to v5°orry about. . They have ac-

what is accepted as the best stand-

more than a certain amount ‘of ment-

Well folks the new semester has
started.-and.I am in the midst of new
work. You said you weren’t satisﬁed
with my marks but it wasn‘t ' -my
fault that theseprofessors dont grade
fair." 71 was going" good in all my "sub-
jectsbut the reason I didn’t pass one
"was because the holdup prof wanted
‘ﬁve dollars"-for giving me a.n'othe"r'ex-
"am and I wouldn’t give it to him.’ I
think -they ought to pay -us for taking
them rather than they charge us‘ for
them. You remember the girl“ that
I"mét’at the church supper'~well-she
and I are getting along ﬁne-now’ and
she said th,at«I was her fellow Iso‘I
guess I’ll show some of these"hicks
up. She says she knows some fel-
lows in a fraternity and introduced
me to them and they treated me fine.
One‘ fellow takes me totheir house
that all the fellows lives in and says
to them heres a man like you never
saw ‘before and they all laughed and
agreedwith him so you seethat I
am well thought of by-those that I
meet. He says I should comeiagain
as it always made the boys feel good
to ‘have someone like- me around.

Well this is about all and I am go-
ing to study hard‘ to show these pik-
ers that I’-am no fool. ’

A FOR MASS SPORTS

-._—_—_.———

 

 

Mass athletics as developed in col-

leges have been undergoing a process

of slow evolution for the past decade.
After a great deal of discussion and
trial it has ﬁna.lly come .to stay in
American university life and at the
presentltime is of ranking importance
in educational ‘circles. A The idea of
the physical “training forthe body as
well as the mind dates back to time
long past, but’ the carrying out of this

_ idea extends backward for’ only a

short period. The system whereby
physical beneﬁts for only a‘ few
through theniedium ofathleti-cs has
given away to the new conception
of beneﬁt for all‘ students. A

‘ I The’ athletic personnel of the pres-‘
ent-day ‘college ‘and. university does
not consist of a chosen score or so,
but is now composedof the entire stu-
dent body. It‘is true that the sys-
tem, has yet to become‘ national and
that at the present time it is carried

tious scale, but the general tendency
on the part of most college adminis-
trations is- to give to the men and

‘ women under their care the best that

can be afforded, both in the way of
mental food and -physical stimulas.
Such a program calls for alarge ﬁnan-
cial outlay audit is on this account
that the movement has not reached
out into wider stratas of accomplish-

_ Conditions Must Change.
Tlieregare a_ few basic and funda-
mental conditions that have to be
present before this system can b.e-

stated, there must be sufficient ﬁnan-

' cial -support. ‘Next ‘in importance to '

‘the ‘monetary ‘factor, .comes',,the7 type
of student ‘body ofwwhich the‘~~Ischool
is composed. Ther’eIare,, two‘ types of
student bodies. ~Ther§il£ is the kind
that is at all times in deﬁnite." connec-
tion with the -ca.mpu"s‘ inﬂuence, the
most important part of school organi-

part of the blame forthe poor stu-
dent organization. .. Those students

cess of af nfassv athleticwsystem. _ It
would not succeed, due to lack of sup-
port on the part of the students’ them-
selves. artmental heads . _ and

when interviewed’ on .-gthe subject,
gave the same answer and without
exception stated that until there was
a. change in the type of students that
enrolled in the school, that conditions
relating to college activities and spir-
it_would remain as they now are.

It is not generally thought possible-
that the" interest that could. be
aroused would be _sufﬁcie_nt to insure
success. -, The writer .made a syste-
matic campaign of inquiry among the"
various student branches and found
the prevalent idea opposed. tovsucha
system. ' _As a. matterof comparison
conditions that exist at Ohio State
and Pitt might’. be taken up. Ohio
Stategwith an enrol1mentI that ‘is
about the same as P.itt’.s, is taking
the lead in mass athletic orgoaniza-‘
tion among the schools of the coun-
try and has attainedva high sta..te.of.
perfection. But that institution en-
joys an entirely opposite stage of con-
ditions‘._ VThe student body at -'l;l1e

the greater percentage of member-
ship in close touch with'th.e radiating
interests of the. institution and had
its student body at all “times within
deﬁnite relationship to the campus, or-
ganizations. ' '

Pitt will have to wait, aiong with a
great numberoof other city universi-
ties, until the student body is in such
a position that they can be “more
closely allied with the workings. of
the university. 11;,’ will not be until

VERSUS .c

V'O.L_ST_E:AD _
. ‘ THE COLLEGIA

 

The'—-‘?’ question has frequently ' been
asked us b.y those on the outside;
“Is"prohibition- a, success where col-
legemen are concerned)?" The ques-
tion has been" answered by a num-
-ber of colleges and ma number, of
ways. The answers‘ given by some
would. indicate that an effort‘ had
be-en’ made to shield their respective
in-stitut-ions from- any possible criti-
cism. Another difference. in the
answers is noticeable between dor-
mitory and non-dormitory colleges. _

In the case of the dormitory col-
lege, the problem is: a.-larger one,
Everyone is familiar with the slogan
‘of a certain southern I-university-—“a
still in every room.” There is,‘ per-
-haps, less personal snpe-rvisionin the
icase of the dormitory student than
in that of the -home ,ISCh.OO1 boy.-I The
‘greatest ‘difference .wrought by pro-
hibition in such an institution’ is
that where formerly plain boozing
parties "were held, brewing and boot-
legging parties‘ now hold sway -with
an added thrill. In the case of the
dormitory” college, prohibition has
‘hindered rather than V helped. ,
At hon-dormitory colleges a slight
Ibeneﬁcial effect may be noticed. The
’hab»it of daytime drinking for pleas-
",ij1_ire’s' sake" or‘ foi-jfthe jsa.tisfa.ction' of
 appetite is a-thing of the past.
Daytime drunkards are a memory of
_bygondii days. Drinking at this type
of ' college _is ‘usually reserved for
_p'artie-s or orgies such‘ as banquets,
and class and -team celebrations
where ‘liquor is consumed for liquor’s
sake, and not to satisfy‘-Ia desire. An
investigation, last’ spring, sliowed
that intoxication at college senior
banquets ranged: from 2 b to 90 per
,cent. This, compared with statistics
cf ten years ago-, shows a'lowe:r min-
cen_tage._ .This, coupled with the fact
-that daytime. drinking is a. thing of

- the past would indicate that p1_'o~hibi-

tionqin the case of the non-_dormi-
Itoryl school has caused an ‘unprove-
ment; ' ' ‘ . .
On .the whole, however, the Vol-
-lstead act has not yet ‘caused de-

Jimmy. De'Hart’s‘ -Washingtonw, and
Lee -passers fell to -defeat at the‘
hands of the Panther quintet __ in a
well’ attended contest held in Tree’s
Gym‘ Wednesday night. The southern
quintet looked superior at the initial‘
part of- the game, when Lake’ started
the scoring_ by dropping in a‘ neat
ﬁeld goal from the center of the floor,
however, the visitors did not have
the lead very long. Hymie Levinson
tied ‘the score and soon -the Panthers,
took a lead which they'held_ for the

that the Red and White did little d;’-”ib-

center of the court was one cause‘ of

The Southerners had _a _weak de-
fense, and the Panthers kept the ball
in their territory most of the ‘game.

game in the ﬁrst period of the game,
but he soon ‘hit his stride and caged
three sensational ﬁeld goals. The
‘ﬁrst half ended with the Pittites on
the long ‘end, 28-12. A ‘A «

The second period began with a
new combinationof players and plays
which Coach Carlson wished to try.
He had Jordan leave the wing posi-_
tion and go to the pivot position.
This proved very satisfactory, as the
"keen-' shooting of Jordan ‘aftervgetting
the tip-off gave Pitt many points. Near

nasium the 1 highly touted and once
defeated Bellefonte Academy team
fell before the, Yearlings i‘-‘tan extra
period game. tThoreson' led“the. scor-
ing with eight ﬁeld goals. Two of
his goals came when they were ‘most
‘needed, in the extra period. This lad
is from‘,Punxsutawn.ey and always
‘plays as if it‘ was his last game and
it depended hntirely upon him. Too
much praise cannot_ be given him. La-

and Shady Side Academy School ath-
lete, ‘and Captain Ash performed bril-
liantly for Bellefonte. Before the
Pitt game, Bellefo_nte’_s' only defeat
was that suffered at the hands of the
‘Penn-Freshmen at Philadelphia.‘
Last Friday the‘.Fr_e-shm_en went to.
‘Indiana to play the. State Normal‘
School. It was 'a walk away for the
Panther Cubs, who won,‘ V62‘-14.‘-alt
was James and Hawkins of the Pan-
thers who put the skids under the
Normal School, each of them getting
-seven ﬁeld goals in three quarters.

were again necessitated “because

game played was won by the Pi
Lambs, who defeated the Sigma Chis,
