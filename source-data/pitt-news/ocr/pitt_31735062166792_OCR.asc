Professor Denies Pitt
Does Secret Research

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY
“The University is not engaged in secret research,”
stated Dr. Richard Tobias, head of the American Associa-
tion of University Professors (AAUP). This is in direct
contradiction to what Dr. James Holland told the Pitt News
in an interview last Monday. He said that the University

does engage in secret research.

“The University has contracted with the Army to Write re-
ports. They just put their information into English,” Tobias -Said.
To-bias also said that the work is classiﬁed ma-inly because the
information handled is classiﬁed. “The Washington, D- C-» Office
does not research any projects itself. It decodes dat-a PT0'Vided by
the Army and signs the University name to the I‘ep0I'vtS.” he point-

ed out.

“In fact,” Tobias said, “graduate students from the English de-
partment have worked in the Washington office on some of the

ports.”

The University’s Faculty Sen-
ate met last Thursday to debate
the issues of the -secret research

‘problem. Tobias, as chairman of

the Senate Committee on Aca-
demic Freedom and Tenure,
worked closely with Francis
H-olahran of the Law Sch.ool,

, ch:airma.'n of the Senate Commit-

tee on Educational Policies.

The ta.sk of these two commit-
tees was to bring before the
Senate a statement of the Uni-
versity’s policy on secret re-
search. “It was one of the most
exciting meetings I have ever
attended,” remarked Tobias.

He also observed that “every-
one spoke extremely well. It was
a genuine forum, like the New
England town m-eetings must
have been,” he added.

“The focus wa.s on how to
maintain independence of the
University,” said Dr. Richard
Cottam, who was also present
at the Senate meeting.

“There were basically ‘W0
groups,” Cottam stated. “One of
these group advocated that na-
tional emergenies call for cer-
tain vital contracts of short dur-
ation. The other group said that
by its very nature, secret re-
search is bad for a university.
This group also felt that the
cold wa.r crisis is not acute
enough for secret research, and
such research should be done by
private concerns,” he said.

Cottam feels that “the Univer-
sity should -strive for funds from
the Federal govermnent that are
stringless, so that we can do the
research we feel is necessary.”

He pointed out that federal
funds determine the direction of

, the growth. of the UniversitY- _

“If these funds were given free-
ly, research could be adjusted to
the needs of individual depart-
ments,” he said. 1 1

Critchfield Backs “Marriage”

Between State and University

by TONI GROSSI

Dean of Student Affairs,
Jack Critchfield, discussed
the future of the University
as a state related institution
in an after-dinner address at
the CWen’s Day Dinner Mon-

day evening.
Dean Critchﬁeld spoke to the

.. intent sophomore women's hon-

orary in 1228 CL. Mrs. Critch-
ﬁeld; Savrin-a Skewis, dean o-f
women, and members of her
staff; the former dean of Stu-
dent Affairs, Helen Poole Rush;
and alumni Cwens were in at-
tendarnce.

The -address of Dean Critch-

V ﬁeld took the form of short dis-

cussions on questions submitted
by the Cwens last week. His key
point was the future of Pllltlt and
he included the advantages and
disadvantages of srta.te-rellated-
ness, future buildings pians for
Forbes Eield, the trimester sys-
tem, and the role of the student
in the community.

Dean Critchﬁeld stated that a
“real marriage had occurred”

,when the University became

state-related and “nothing short
of public wrath would ever di-
vorce the two again.” He felt
that the state of Pennsylvania
had ‘-lagged behind many states
and done nothing for higher ed-
ucation for many years. Penn
State, ' Temple, and the Univer-
sity were ﬁne examples of the
stal_fe’s recognition of the need
to -invest in higher education.

The Dean sees state-re1ated-
ness as the wisest step to in-
volvement that the state could
take. Due to the exorbitant costs
of education, it would be eco-
nom-ically unfeasible to “lbuild
from scratc .”

Uéﬁii B'rll:l?liﬁ‘éi‘d  new
advrantages to the University’s
state-relatedness". “The Universi-
ty now has a ﬁrm ﬁnancial base
on which to build,” he said.
“Alumni support never came
through with the amount need-
ed to realize the dreams of for-

_ mer Chancellor Litchﬁeld.” The

Dean added that private institu-
tions have a long road to hoe.
Hundreds of institutions live
from rrfonth to month.

“The difference between a me-
diocre and a good, or even ex-

’ cellent state-related University,”

he stated, “is the degree to which
its alumni provide support.”

Secondly, the reduction in tui-
tion has '-relieved the cost bar-
rier for many qualiﬁed students
“Alpplicati-ons jumped from 4,-
000 in 1966 to 7,000 in 1967 in a
application period decreased by
three months,” he stated.

Finally, the University has
building priority with the Gen-
eral State Authority which
would never have been possible
before. The University has the
right of eminent domain, thus
slavling thousands of dollars in
previously needed court corn-
demnati-on action.

Dean Critchﬁeld noted as dis-
advantages the difficulty in

' -maintaining desired percentage
1 of out-of-state students and the

uncertainty of the date of ap-
proval by the state legislature
of the University's appropria-
tions. He sighted this year as

— an example.

Dean Criltchﬁeld projected tlhlat

1. tField area in October of 1969,

-. rate’s season. The quadrangle,

Shladyside.

Chancellor Posvar envisions a
matrix system of cluster build-
ings all having common facil-
ities on the ground and ﬁrst
ﬂoor levels. There would be no
elevators on these levels.

The Dean qualiﬁed his state-
ments on the trimester system.
He said that the system was un-
der investigation and would be
thoroughly discussed in Decem-
ber. “The enrollment last sum-
mer seems to give evidence that
year round school is a good
idea,” he commented.

Dean Critchﬁeld is convinced
that if the trimester would have
sheen instituted in 1967 rather
1959 it would have been ,a re-
sounding success. He feels that
the September to April system
will continue no, matter what
name it will fall under. The dif-
ference would come in the
lspring-‘summer term. One sug-
-gesti-on was to have two eight
week sessions, one geared at the
upper divisions, the other at
the undergraduates.

going towards

The Dean ended his speech
with a look at the University
students role in the community.
He summarized this with a
stolen quote on maturity, “the

-ability to make yourself do the

things you have to do even when
you don't like to do it.”

THANKSGIVING
SERVICE SET

The YWCA has invited the
University community to at-
tend a Service of Thanksgiv-
ing in word, song, and dance
tomorrow at noon in Heinz
Chapel. The non-sectarian serv-
ice is being presented by the
YWCA along with members
of Orchesis and Heinz Chap-
el Concert Choir and is open
to students and faculty of all
faiths.

A theme of celebration of
life and of men’s responsibil-
ity for one another will be ex-
pressed in the service by
means of contemporary read-
ings, interpretive dances to
Hebrew and Christian music,
and anthems sung by the
Choir. -

It just makes good sense for the
graduate engineer or scientist,
contemplating the direction of his
professional career, to make sure
that he has all the information he
needs about every company he is
considering-—-that he has total

input information—before he makes

a connection.

If you’re good. If you’re really
good. If you have learned to use
the knowledge you have acquired
as a starting point from which to
launch new ideas, you probably

know already that your talents are

in demand. There is always a
seller's market for intellect.

But there can be more to your
future than buy and sell.
Satisfaction is a commodity that
cannot be exchanged.

When you are considering where
you will start in the complex world

of aerospace, while you are
gathering .input information, we

urge you to investigate the
opportunity for a satisfying career
here at the Pomona division of
General Dynamics.

Here are five reasons why it would

be a wise move for you now:

‘Pitt News’ Interview

V Dean of Men Outlines ‘L
Emergency Loan Fund

Peter, Paul, And Mary

by JOE ANDERSON

and BARRY SCHLACTER

Mary was relaxing on a
couch in her dressing room
when we came in for the in-
terview. She wore a light
blue mini-skirt with -her tra-
ditional white high heels.

Paul was out of the‘ room
signing autographs in hi-s tur-
tle-neck ‘sweater, grey bell-bot
toms and black leather boots.
The years have taken their toll,
and Paul] is beginning to lose
his hair. Peter was around some-
where kissing “the kids.” He has
lost his goatee but he retains a
«bushy rnustache and he now has
long, black Dylanesque vhxai-r.
The times change and so do Pe-
ter, Paul, and Mary for stagna-
tion means death for any artist:

Pitt News: Mary, your last
two records Album and Model
1700 show a divergence from the
folk traditions of the early ’60’s.
What are your plans for the fu-
ture?

Mary: In our last album we
were experimenting with new
sounds and techniques. This will
deﬁnitely be continued in the
future. We are now in the pro-
cess of cutting our ninth album
which will con-tain a few songs
wri-tten by Paul and Peter. We
are also contemplating an al-
bum in which each of us will be
featured individu-allly, four solos
by each of us.

Pitt News: How much longer
do you  Peter, Paul, and

Mary will continue as a group?

Mary: That's a hard question
to answer. Right now I don't
see an end in sight. But, I am
31 and have two children; I
do-n’t think I'll still be singing
when I'm 40.

We talked to Paul out in the
hall as he was signing auto-
graphs.

Pitt News: Paul, what sort of
interest do you have besides
your car and house?

Paul: As you said, I have a
car and house; miarterial things
I have. No-w I am trying ‘to
acquire spinitual aspect as well.

I can see this even by the
way you kids come back stage
after a performance and ask
questions. That's the point,
youth is asking questions, tthey’re
search-ings things out for them-
se1ves—its .a type of introspec-
tion. ,

S=pinitu*a-lly, I believe in God,
but I don't belong to any denom-
ination. There has to be a G-od
or a supreme being or else
there would be no purpose to
life.

What I would like to do is to
-go to India . . . but it's im:pos's‘i-
ble for me now.

We talked to Peter last.

Pitt News: Coufld you tell us
something about the movie you
made.

Pefter: During the last year I
helped’ produce a documentary
called, You Are What You Eat.
Barry McGuire, The Beatles,
'l_‘im Hardin, and Peter Paul and

Mary have parts in the ﬁlm.

Pitt News: Can you telll us
what the plot is?

Peter: Not really, :it’s hard to
explain. You have to -see the film
to really understand what it is
about.

Pitt News: Did you do any of
your compositions in tonight's
concert?

.Peter: Yes. One song in par-
ticular, that I am often asked to
talk about, that w-e did tonight
was The Great Mandella. Which
is on our album, Model 1700.”

In the song, we have an ar-
gument going on between a
youth and his father over the
son's refusal to ﬁght in the War.
The father can’t_ understand
why h.is son is doing this to
him. L

Pitt News: Do Peter, Paul
and Mary as a group decide on
what songs to be performed?

Peter: It's very rare when
two people agree on the same
thing and even more so when
three agree. But, that is seldom
a problem with us. We have a
great solidarity o-f interest and
seldom disagree. When we do
disagree we don't try and force
our opinion on each other, but
rather work around it. A good
example of this is the song I
wrote, If I Had Wings. Mary
«and Paul both disagreed with
the last verse, but instead of
having them sing a song that
they didn’t believe in, we made
it into a solo and everyone was
satisﬁed.

Allthou-gh he believes that there will be a reorganization in his
office, Dean Herbert McGibbeny, dean of men, feels that it is im-

portant for the student body to get to know the members of his . ‘H

staff.

Each member of the staff has speciﬁc functions to pelrform.
Yet they are all involved in the functions of the Emergency Loan

Fund. In actuality, there are
four funds, which were given as
endowments to lend any under-
graduate student money in an
emergency.

The four funds are the Cﬂiapp
Fund, the Men's Council Loan
Fund, In-terfraternity Council
(IFC) Loan Fund and the Bing
Crosby Loan Fund.

The different funds are basic-
ally organlzed in the same man-
ner. A Loans are made only to
full-time undergraduate students
and they range from $5 to $100,
which must be paid back with-
n one year or before graduation.
There is also a nominal service
charge.

Dean McGibbeny added that
“no student is denied money, if
he has a genuine emergency,
subject to the aviailnabi-l;ity of
funds." There is a large turn-
out and over 200 students can
participate at the ‘same time.

“One of our «biggest needsisl, 
for an increase in the amount < A

of available funds,” he added.
“Unfortunately,

change in the total amount of
money in about ten years. Yet
the enrollment has increased
substantially.”

Although many students 
discrimination occurs when they
-are asked if they are in a fra-
tennity, irt  just that IFC has a
fund for their members. If fra-
ternity members receive money
from their fund, it leaves more
money in the other funds for
the other students, clariﬁed Dean
M-cGibobeny.

McGibbeny feels that they

Editorial: A Question of   Honor

The keys for Omicron Delta Kappa (ODK), Druids, and Pi Delta
Epsilon are displayed on the Cathedral lawn today. As we go over the
tapping lists, once again we see glaring omissions from each list, and once
again we must question the method of selection for these honoraries.

We could not, in all fairness, make any blanket statement concerning
those who did or did not get tapped into the honoraries in question. An
unusually high percentage of those recognized have made significant con-
tributions in the area -of either extracurricular activities or scholarship
in their respective fields. However, there are noticeable omissions on each
list, particularly ODK.

Why.do we single out ODK? We question its selections not only be-
cause of glaring omissions, but also because of the prestige attached to
this particular honorary. ODK, as the junior and senior men’s leadership
honorary, is considered the highest recognition male students can attain
on our campus. Although it is without question an honor to be tapped into
ODK, we strongly believe that the method of selection adhered to by the
members tarnishes the honorary.

We definitely approve of the intense activity of our student leade-rs,
especially in reference to political issues, campus or otherwise. Why, then,
are students repeatedly denied admission to ODK because they have cour-

ageously made their viewpoint known and have strongly defended what
they believe?

Mu:st we continually witness so—called liberals, for example, being
“power elite” on our campus? Must be continually witness students being
excluded from ODK because they are not liked by the majority of the mem-
bership, even though they are technically qualified? We are not question-
ing the honorary; we are questioning those members who abuse the honor
bestowed upon them. We can see no excuse for excluding people who have
made significant contributions, but have failed to meet the particular qual-
ifications established by certain members.

All too often honoraries become havens for a particular clique of
people, who strive to perpetuate their own sense of values at the expense
of bettering the honorary. Recognition is only an honor When it is fairly
distributed. It becomes tainted when it serves to exclude those who are
deserving but have made “enemies” in ODK who are determined to slight
them.

We in no way intend to cast asperions on those who were selected
not only to ODK, but also to Druids and Pi Delta Epsilon. Honoraries as
an institution do serve a purpose, in that they recognize contributions
made by students that better the University community. We only wish
that the selection process did not continually exclude so many qualified
students who just haven’t played their cards right.

Women’s Housing

Displaced Honor Dorms-

Associated Women Stu-
dents (A.WS) has issued a
statement protesting the
moving of women’s honors
housing for next year (see
the Pitt News, Fri., Nov.
17); Tower C undergradu-
ates have signed petitions
expressing their desire to
remain in honors areas
there; Amos Hall residents
are against the switch, also.
Who can dismiss the desires
of these women and insist

«.t.ha§-!29ri9£§..¥.1.0u illguas it

is now known, e move
from Tower C to Amos for
1968-1969? The answer is
easy: The Twelfth Floor
(Dean of Women’s Office)
and the other “powers that
be.”

When I spoke briefly to
Miss Lorraine Sibbet, direc-
tor of women’s housing
about the proposed relocat-
ing of the honor housing,
she related, “Unless some-
one gives me a series of jus-
tified reasons for keeping
honors housing in Tower C,
we -will undobtedly move
it.” AWS, present honors
students, and other inter-
ested women have begun to
do just this thing. At meet-
ings held last Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday, wom-
en began to consolidate
their ideas and to formulate

‘ proposals.

To better evaluate the
stands of students and ad-
ministration, we should re-
view some of the issues in-
volved:

-> The administration
wants to move honors hous-
ing to a smaller area (Amos
has approximately 67 avail-
able beds compared to the

I 144 in Tower C- in order to

made the dorm more truly
an honors area. Admittedly
the criteria for acceptance
into honors housing has not
been extremely high, but no

one has complained about
this, as far as I can discern.
Thus, one can assume that

full occupancy of all rooms

in Tower C, as all rooms on
campus, is extremely im-
portant.

> Financially speaking
housing must be as full as
possible throughout the Uni-
versity. For this reason the
Director of Women’s Hous-
ing would rather have pro-
portionate1y_fewer places to
ﬁll (especially in the Win-
ter term) in Amos than the
more numerous rooms 111
Tower C. As of last Friday
only two rooms were empty
in Tower C. However these
could be ‘filled if it were
not for technical rather
than inherent difficulties.

Last spring when hous-
ing contracts were drawn
up at the Oakland Campus
many of the rooms in Tow-
er C were not filled. Yet, in
talking to students from re--
gional campuses, I find that

r they were not given enough

information about Oakland
honors, or that such infor-
mation was not offered in
a manner that would sug-
gest the benefits of honors

housing. If more relocates‘

who want honors housing
would live in Tower C, not
only would the honors com-
mittee be able to be more
selective, but the rooms
could be filled. A second
way to insure complete oc-
cupancy of the rooms is to
allow first or second term
sophomores to live in hon-
ors housing. Still a third
way would be to make Tow-
er C into half honors and
half traditional housing.’

> To live in Tower C is a
privilege!!! The rooms are
singles, air conditioned (us-
ually), convenient to meals
and snacks, and the closest

V housing.

by Beth Lazerick

dorm to the University men
who live on campus (if that
makes a difference to any-
one). The Twelfth Floor is
toying with the idea of put-
ting freshmen women back
into Tower C. This is say-
ing that freshmen women
should have what many con-
sider to be the best housing
on campus. No university
in the nation deliberately
offers prime housing. to
freshmen at the expense of
the uuperclassmen. Fortun-
ately some people are now
considering putting upper-
class and freshmen in Tow-
er C if honors housing must
be moved to Amos. To those
who were at Friday’s meet-
ing, this is a more satisfac-
tory proposition.

To ask honors women to
live in suites (granted they
will be allowed to select
roommates from a list of
eligible women) would be
forcing women into a room-
mate situation that they
may be trying to avoid, for
some would rather not have
to worry about waking a
friend at 3 a.m. in the morn-
ing when they wander in.
Thus singles are more con-
ducive to honors housing be-
cause of the privacy as well
as the ease of studying.

Seniors will not be affect-
ed by the outcome of this
controversy. It is the opin-
ion of freshmen, sophomore,
and junior women that
must be heard. Women may
attend housing board meet-
ings at 5 p.m. Wednesday
on the 12th floor CL, they
may see Miss Marcia Buck-
bee or Miss Sibbet in the
Dean of Women’s Office, or
they can contact Honor’s
Housing Board in Tower C.

If students can show
through these means a plan
for dealing with the prob-
lem of full occupancy of
Tower C and the question
of honors housing, the Dean
of Women’s staff and all
others concerned should
feel it is their duty and ob-
ligation to follow the wish-
es of those who, after all,
must live in University

Army’s Sugar Bowl

A Sour Situation

by Dan Lichtenstein

THE PENTAGON’S RULIN G to make West Point re-
fuse a Sugar Bowl bid is a bitter one to all concerned. .

Football fans are furious, the cadets and their team are
disappointed and the soldiers in Viet Nam, who are the basic
object of the ruling, are probably just as disappointed. Anti-
administration groups must surely point to the ruling as
just another _perpetration by their pet peeve, the “indus-
trial-military complex.”

But the matter is more down-to-earth than the usual
demonstrator’s gripes, and I do not intend to use it as an-
other cause for the anti-Viet war protestors to protest. For
one thing, officially, the administration did not make the
ruling. The Pentagon did. It will not lead to 100,000,more
draftees, nor will it produce.1,000 more tons of napalm. The
ruling is just a silly, thoughtless, useless disappointment.

I AM SURE I would not be happy in the army, especial-
ly in Viet Nam. But if I were, I would feel at least a certain
allegiance to the military by virture of my millions of col-
leagues fighting or sitting at desks throughout the world.
It would be a feeling not unlike that expressed in “misery
loves company.” »

Under these conditions, I would be proud and happy
that Army had a winning football team and I would like to
see them crush whomever they would meet in a bowl game.
Inter-service rivalry has American servicemen all over the
world root heartily for their teams in the Army—Navy game.
Because a soldier is wallowing in a bunker near Saigon, he
will not necessarily damn other soldiers in Philadelphia’s
JFK Stadium trying to roll over a few Navy men late 1' this
month.

Why should this interest in football change just because
the Army Black Knights met someone other than the Mid-
dies in the pageantry of a prestigious New Year’s Day bowl
game? Would morale in Viet Nam be in serious danger if
the Black Knights were a high ranked football team and
beat or even lost to Miami, Alabama or Georgia? I doubt it.
If the Pentagons’ rationale is that thousands of soldiers
should not be cheering a soldier’s football team while other
soldiers are stationed too far away to actually watch the
game, the generals should just ask any GI what he thinks.

AT HOME, the disappointment is, of course, more pro-
nounced. Last year, UCLA crushed USC in a regular season
game, but the latter school received a bid to the Rose Bowl.
The UCLA students created a riot and blocked traffic in Los
Angeles in their protestations. Even if there were any traf-
ﬁic in West Po-int, New York, the cadets could hardly get
away with such insubordination as a riot. But they did dem-
onstrate their disappointment if in a more subtle way.

Last Friday, hundreds of sugar bowls were stolen from
the West Point dining hall. I doubt that their mule took the
bowls. ‘

The disappointment of thousands of football fans who
have a right to see the best possible post-season bowl games
is just as bitter as the cadets’ and common soldier’s disap-
pointment.

Sports Illustrated quoted a rumor that claimed Presi-
dent Johnson said that he did n-ot think the spectacle of
‘hundreds of America’s best educated young men knocking
each other down on Saturday afternoons while thousands
of people cheer is indicative of a peace-loving nation. Sports
Illustrated hopes Johnson did not make the statement. Mil-
lions of sports fans must prayed that he didn't. The situation
is reminiscent of the USSR pulling its athletes out of their
track meet with the U.S. because of Vietnam. The GI’s in
Saigon are not. gaining anything, but the military and
.¢ivilian.f°°tba11fans at, are 195mg 31°‘-

The request to rescind the
invitation of the University
to ‘Dow Chemical Company
to recruit on campus was in
no way an attempt—as the
Administration has decid-
ed to define it —— to limit
anyone’s free speech. Rath-
er, it was quite clearly, as
outlined in the open letter
to the placement office, an
effort to force the Univers-
ity to look at itself, its aims,
its objectives, and to realize
that it no longer functions
as an independent commun-
ity of learning.

Dean Critchfield writes,
“It has always been the
practice of the University
of Pittsburgh to permit
each student the opportun-
ity to meet on campus with
prospective employers in
order that he can intelli-
gently make his own choice
of employment. This has be-
come an increasingly impor-
tant and integral part of

  An Open Letter

   

any university’s function in
an era when students must
make decisions about their
future roles in an ever more
complex, technological so-
ciety.” We strongly disagree
with the idea of a university
which is implicit in this
statement. Dean Critch-
field’s center of learning
and scholarship maintains
little or no independence
from the rest of society; in-
deed, it is an “integral part”
of his university to inte-
grate effectively its stu-
dents into the outside, eco-
nomic world.

Mr. Critchfield continues:
To prohibit this opportun-
ity to any student meeting
with any prospective em-
ployer, operating within the
framework of‘ civil law,
would be analogous to pro-
hibiting a legal expression
of opinion because some
persons disagree with it.”

The analogy is false. We
are not blocking the Dow
representative at the air-
port; any Pitt student can
meet him anywhere in the

   

city as far as we are con-
cerned, but not on campus.
Recruiting has no part to
play in auniversity com-
munity. “What about free
speech?” we are asked;
“Aren’t Communists allow-
ed to speak on campus?”
Yes, Communists are invit-
ed to speak and so too are
therepresentatives of Dow.
But we have yet to see, nor
do we want to see, the Com-
munist Party recruiting
through the good offices of
the academic community.

Certainly free speech is
to be cherished in a univers-
ity; it is a good part of
what our community should
be all about. But the ques-
tion of whether or not Dow
should be allowed to recruit
is not by any means a ques-
tion of' denying Dow its
freedom of speech. Dow has
refuse to speak or debate.
If anything, then, it is a
question of Dow’s refusal
to abide by the standards
and values of an academic
community.

Ultimately it is a ques-

From Stud

   

     

tion of the nature of the
University. Should the Uni-
versity exist within and be-
come a part of the moral
vacuum outside its halls, or
should it sit in continuous
and urgent judgment and
criticism of the society in
which it exists? Should it,
with the companies with
which it cooperates so di-
rectly, abdicate the moral
reponsibility which is so
lacking in our society? Are
we in this university mere-
ly part of a fact exchange,
or are we involved in an ex-
perience for which the tran-
sition of values is an inte-
tegral process? And has not
not the University abdicat-
ed any sense of its role in
shaping, debating and ex-
changing concepts so basic
as right and wrong?

It has. Dow Chemical
Company’s presence on our
campus is merely one mani'-
festation of the perversion
of the nature of our Uni-
versity. We were serious
and concerned enough to
register our displeasure

The government of the Union
of South Africa has been iso-
lated from legal modernization.
This view was advanced by Dr.
Robery Beranek, associate pro-
fessor of political science at Du-

CC. -7-:  quesne University in a panel
I , discuss-ion held 'Ilh~u=rsday night.

The discussion was sponsored
-by the Pittsburgh Commiittee on
Southern Aﬁnica, an organiza-

_ tion formed two years ago with

the avowed purpose of “msa.k~i:ng
.the American public aware of
«the unjust regime in existence
in the Urnion of South Africa.”
The panel tried to correlate
civil liberties «and the existence
of freedom of the press as we
have it here in the United States
wlilth the conditions in South
Ajinica. It was composed of
Thomas Kerr, the Pittsburrgh
-chairman of the American Civil
Liberties Union; Professor Stain-
ton Wettick of the University’s
~?School of Law; and Beranek.

4 The moderator was John Flan-

-nigan of the ‘Committee.

Kerr described -the conditions
as we know them in ‘America as
the ways people live together
with the least mount of tension.
He cited three ways of consider-
ing the individual with respect
to the state: first, the freedom
of exchange of ideas; second,
due process of law; and third,
equality before the law.

Wettick explained that there
is 8. lack of protection from the
inordinate power of the gov-
"ernm-enrt in South Africa. He
cited the role of the Courts. “Al-

,.vthJou-gh South Africa -has no Con-

ever, the legislature can ‘over-
ride a court decision by passing
a law. In other words, “the leg-

used its power to create a to-
-talitarian system.”

Wettick also cited the limita-
tions on individual rights. He
pointed out that the notorious
apartheid law pose severe limit-
at-iorls on civil liberties.

Beranek believed that the im-
portance of South Africa is as
a model for political scientists
to study because of its totalitari-
an form of government. He said
that “the regime could be con-
sidered tota.-lly undemocratic in

Discrimination Finds Way

Into Aged Greek System

(Confirmed from Page 1)

the California statewide Dean of
Student Affairs.

But, who is wrong may be an-
other matter. The Sigma Chi
fraternity has never had such
problems. They have never been
restricted by the national on the
matter of “membership,” says
chapter President Mike Bryson.

“Sigma Chi is being made a
test case,” Bryson said. “It is a
big fraternity, and there are at
least 20 other national fraterni-
ties in the country that have dis-
criminatory polices; some, ac-
tually outright.”

Bryson, however, did admit
that Sigma Chi “has a hierarc-hy
of opproval.”

Citing the California cases,
Bryson feels local chapters need
guidance. “I disagree that local
chapters should use their own
judgment in picking members.
Some chapters do what they
want; they don’t care. This
weakens national ties,” he said.

A weakening of ties with the
national may hurt chapters, but
whether or not the national or-
ganizationlhas the right to force
local chapters to accept only cer-
tain members seems to be an-
other question.

Any organization may be free

  

to admit who they Want; it is
their choice.

It may be called discrimina-
tion, if a local chapter at first
accepts a man, and then, carry-
ing out orders from above, re-
jects him.

Many foreign students have
misconceptions about life in the
US. The Department of Gen-
. eral Linguistics at the Universi-
aty has -taken a step forwvard in
changing some of the miscon-
ceptions of foreign students by
linstituting a special program
-for English teachers from 11
foreign countries. The Universi-
‘ ty is one of three schools in the

US sponsoring such programs.
The program, which is spon-
T sored by -the US Office of Edu-
catlion, is comprised of one stu-
dent each from Argentina, Fin-
' land .and Nepal; two from Bra-
zil, Chile, Turkey and Japan;
three from Haiti; four from
, Mexico; and ﬁve students from
_ El Salvador. The Office of Ed-
ucation felt that the opportun-
ity for these teachers to learn
-about the US would be greater
' if they were able to live with

Americans during their stay.

On Man And His God 3

by ARNIEYOUNG .

In today’s complex society, does man have freedom of
choice? Shane Miller, author of Desert Figh'ter—Story of
the Dead Sea Scrolls,” said that “man is given the freedom
of choice, to choose ‘whatever he wants to do. But he must
be aware that he may become trapped by the consequences
of his decision.” These consequences may be a result of
man’s acting against the Universal Laws.

Speaking to the Association of
Research and Enlightenment,
Miller said that through incor-
rect decisions man will -grow
and hopefullyresort to prayer
and meditation to decide conrect-
ly in the future.

The Ass-ociarti-on is an organiz-
ation founded to study and ap-
ply the advice given by the psy-
chic, Edgar Cayce. Miller draws
hllls
“readings.”

Miller believes that universal
laws stem from the concept of
free choice. Miller defined the
Law of Cause and Effect as a
choice to “search for God and
the inner light within you.”

By applying this law and grant-
ing free choice to others, man,
according to Miller, is in accord
with the Law of Grace and Love.
“New man recognies that God
is in other individuals also,”
Miller said.

information from Cayce’=s

“Through daily love," stress-
ed Mille-r, “man's mind and body
become healed and he seeks a
pleasant anticipation of the fu-
ture.” This is the Daw of Regen-
eration and Renewal. “Man lets

go of things past and dead and
searches for new things. Then
he becomes a truly creative per-
son.”

Miller stated that the ultimate
result will be the Law of Abid-
ing Presence. “Through prayer
and meditation, man will be-
come manifested in ‘being’ and
the God-force will be in charge
and regulate circumstances. Man
is only a Witness to his own
life. His will is made one with
God,’:s,” said Miller. Miller, how-
ever, said -he would only state
this ll3JW a.nd n-ot go in.to detail
for it seem-ed to provide a con-
tradiction to the entire philoso-
phy.

Fr HOW TO DISPROVE SEIDLEMAN’S LAW

Seidlemans’ law is one of the world’s great axioms. It
simply states that under given circumstances if anything
can go wrong, it will go wrong.

Pitt h.as its own» version of Seidleman’s law. So-‘me peo-
ple like to call it “The Pitt Chill”; other refer to it as the
Pitt jinx; still others term it lousy football.

Actually, the Panthers are capable of playing good foot-
ball for at least three quarters. They’ve proved that in loss-
es to Navy, Syracuse, and now Army. The Panthers just
don’t know how to win.

ARMY DOES. They’ve won the close ballgames all sea-
son long and their record is 8-1. Army coach Tom Cahill
praised his quarterback, Steve Lindell, for pulling another
one out of the fire. “Some people have the ability to make
, the big play,” ‘Cahill said. “Llindell’s one of them. I can’t
explain why he does and others don’t.”
to his halfback Lynn Moore on a fourth and 16 play midway
through the fourth quarter. “Linde1l called the pattern in
the huddle.” Moore related afterwards. It was a n-ormal pass
play.” As Mo-ore spoke, someone reminded him that Army
had used the identical play to break open last week’s game
with Utah. “Well, then I guess Steve knew that,” Moore
laughed. _
On the other side, Pitt defensive backfield coach Bill
Lewis was shaking his head. “Take away that one play,” he
said, “and our kids played sound defense. -

9’

“I HAVE FOUR SENIORS who don’t deserve to lose
like this,” Lewis declared. “When we had the 12-7 lead at
halftime, we knew that Army would have to throw to beat
us. So all we did was go over our coverage on that particular
play.”

3* The locker room blackboard confirmed what Lewis -had
described. Diagrammed on it was the Army play that wo-n
the game.

- On the field, the Panther defenders had been positioned
properly, but for some reason they couldn’t prevent the
play.

Lewis dismissed immediately any idea of inevitable de-
feat because of a jinx. “We’re just going to have to put it
all together, 'that’s all,” he noted.

THE NIGHT BEFORE, Lewis had watched from the
stands as the freshmen blew a game they had every right
to win. Fans in the seats around him were saying things
like, “same old Pitt chill.” But actually. the Cubs had shown
everyone that they could block and tackle on the same field

:.,r as ‘Notre Dame. And if defensive halfback Bill Pietrantonio
S‘ hadn’t gotten injured late in the fourth quarter, the Cubs
might have ‘hung on. _ _

“It was some weekend,” Lewis moaned. But standing
a few feet away coach Howard Weyers told no one in par-
ticular what he thought of Army. “We’re blowing these
people right -out of the Stadium next year.”

Await Finale with Cats

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Sports Editor

It could have been like this: Victory.
Bob Bazylak, the number one quarterback in only two
games this year, opened Arm.ys secondary with 20 of 46

pass completions for 249 yards and engineered the second Panther
victory, 12-7 at the Stadium Saturday. ‘

Instead, it was like this: De-‘

feat.

Army, capitalizing on a fourth
a:nd 16 situation, turned back an
upset-minded Panther team, 21-
12, at the Stadium Saturday.

Steve Lindell, previously
thrown for a 10 yard loss by
Paul Naponick at the Oats’ 23-
yard line, caught Lynn Moore
with a pass on the Panther one.
Two plays later, ‘Moore who had
two touchdowns called back this
season b-ecause of penalties
scored his first slix-poilnter -of the
year. A swing pass from Lin-

dell to Clnarlie Jarvis for two _

poinits, and Army went ahead
to stay, 15-12.

And. Dave Hart felt like this:

er. I’m sick, and I never feilt

worse over losing.

“There was no doubt in my
mind that we were going to
Win. No doubt.

“And «then, on that fourth and

16 play, I ﬁgured we had stop-.

ped them. I ﬁgured we would
get the ball.

“Even in the closing mzinutes,
when we were down by three
points, I ﬁgured we would get
.-the ball back. I ﬁgured we would
score.

“I just remember what Dave
Drake said at halftime. He said,
‘Let’s go out and win  one
for the students; we can’t let
them down.’

“I just cant believe it hap-
pened.

“I dont know the kids feel
after losing like that.”

For Hart it was a combina-
tion of too much losing. The
Cubs lost Friday night to the
the Notre Dame freshmen, and
then the Panthers lost their
eighth of the year.

And, 22,310 spectators felt
like this: Disheartened.

“You know they’re winning,
but when that last quarter
comes, you actually Wait for
them to lose. You just keep
waiting for them to fumble, or
punt the ball 10 yards. You just
wait for them to lose"

One gent said, “They're like
the Mets. You cheer, even if
they lose yardage.”

Penn State, the Panther’s ﬁn-
al opponent feels like this: Con-
ﬁdent.

Over the Thanksgiving vaca-
rtion, when many Penn State
students, conﬁdent of a Nittany
Lion win, go home, the Pan-
thers will prepare for what Joe
Paterno calls, “a team which
should be in the nation’s top ten.”

ZAn.d, for any sportswriter it
was like this: Frustration.

The Panthers, throughout the
game, had the edge over the

Cadets, who the day beiiore

Sugar Bowl dreams.

But, four times in the third I

period Armys defense stopped
the Panthers within the 22. And-
it made all the difference to the
Cadets’ spirirts despite the in-
dividual performances of Bazy-
iak and his two ends, Bob bongo
and George Medich.  . 

Longo caught nine passes for
112 yards. He caught his ﬁrst
two touchdown passes of the
year. And -he added to his school

Lose Seventh, 7-1
Booters Beaten by Lions

  As Soccer Season Ends

by DAVE TIERNAN
Saturday the soccer team finished the season with a
7 -1 loss to Penn State. Five senior booters started the game,
which was close only in the first half. Penn State led 2-0
at halftime, but erupted for five goals in the second half, as

Coach Leo Bemis substituted freely.

The muddy field and the uncomfortable overnight stay in Tyrone,
Pa. seemed to take their toll on the booters in the second half. The
offense was bogged down and couldn’t penetrate State’s diamond
defense.

Penn State’s offense, which led the Lions to a winning season,
was able to play their usual break-awlay game and managed to use
the mud to their advantage, scoring three times while the booter
defense was slopping after them in vain. And to some people, the
booters’ efforts all year were in vain.

Soccer here has little support from the student body, mainly be-
cause it competes with football during the. the fall months; but the
players train, practice and devote as much time to the game as the
football team, without the glory. Why?

The senior agreed that they enjoyed playing the game. Despite
the season’s record of twin wins, seven losses and two ties, captain
Gary Foertsch, Pete Snyder, who scored the goal in Saturday’s loss,
Joe Kruth, Blaine Popp and Terry Weiler felt other aspects of the
season were bright.

All five of the seniors said that the record could and should have
been better. “We just didn’t get the breaks, or the shots, we might
have,” noted Kruth. Foertsch added, “When we were sophomores, we
won nineand only lost one. We had a lot of breaks and ended up in
the NCAA playof .”

Breaks help, but coaching and spirit are important to a winning

a team, too. The sp.irit on this Yt:ar’s team has been frequently men-

tioned as being “good,” “great,” and “the greatest” by the entire

A team at different times during the year. But what about the coaching?

“A coach should instill desire in his players,” said Kruth. “Bob
McNulty (Frosh coach until leaving a 25-3 record behind him last
year to take a head coaching job at Jersey City College) did it, and
we played well for him as freshmen and kept the spirit he taught
us.”

1 Foertsch was co-captain along with Bob Racunas in the beginning
of the season, but Racunas was advised by a doctor to terminate his
playing in view of a serious head injury he received this summer.

The soccer team lost one of its brightest prospects in years, and

possibly Racunas could have supplied the scoring punch lacking in

the offense all year.

But Racunas’ departure not only hurt the team; it left Foertsch
with the responsibiity of a captain, without a co-captain to help with
the coordination needed between a team and its coach.

If anyone knows both sides of the story, it's Foertsch. He said
this about the coaching: “Pitt is not like a Physical Education school,
where the players are in closer contact with sports. The players here

»worklat their studies, and practice two hours a day. They need a

coach to inspire them during those practices.”
So, the soccer team has lost five seniors, but the Freshmen team

- is supposed to have the replacements. But even if the juniors and

S0Dhomores on this year's team maintain the spirit the seniors in-

. stilled inlthem, and the replacements are there next year, the team
may again fall short of expectations, according to the departing,

Thiesman’s Third TD Toss
Turns Cub Win Into Loss

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL
The freshman football team almost beat the Notre
Dame frosh Friday night at Forbes Field, but almost doesn't

count. a

With only 38 seconds remaining to be played, the win that al-
most was, wasn’t, when quarterback Joe Theisman completed a 15-

yard pass to fullback Ron John-
son for a touchdown and a 21-
18 Irish ’lead.

It was a hard game to lose,
but the Cubs’ performance made
coach Darrell Lewtis proud of
his players.

“I have to be satisﬁed,” said
Lewis sincerely. “The kids stay-
ed in -the game until the very
end, and that’s what we want to
see around here.”

Staying in the game against
Notre Dame teams has been a
problem for most college foot-
ball team-s for many years now.
And the Fighting Irish frotsh
of 1967 were representative of
Notre Dame’s imxage a-s a foot-
b3Jll power.

“Notre Dame had a real good
football team,” said Lewis.
“They always have good teams.”
Lewis considered the Irish frosh
to be the best on the Cubs’
schedule.

“N otre Dame was much better
than Ohio State,” said Lewis
positively .‘as if there was no
comparison.

But the Cubs were on top for
59:22 of playing time. Lewis
used a few fancy plays to sur-
prise the Lrish frosh.

Midway in the opening quar-
ter Lewis substituted 5-9 quar-
terback Dave Havern for Mike
Bannon. The Cubs lined up in
a s:}'1lo-tgun formration and Hav-
earn hait J. D. Lewis in the ﬂat

_ Lewis tight roped his way down

the -sidelines and the play was
good for 43 yards and a touch-
down.

At the end of_ the quarter
coach Lewis had his Cubs rim-
ning. A 16 yard quarterback
keeper, followed by seven car-
ries by tailback. Dave Garnett,
set up fullback Tony Esposito’s
two-yard plunge into the end
zone.

In the third quarter, Lewis
varied from his regular forma-
tion with more of the shrort:gu.n
and the T. It worked. Liming up
in the shotgun, Havern took a
snap from the 35-yard line, look-
ed for a receiver, but kept the
ball and ran for 31 yards. Tony
Esposi-to then bul-led into the
end zone for his second touch-
down and an 18-9 lead. _

Lewis also used a few double
reverses, a shotgun formation
with the fullblaxck taking the
Snlajp, and some ﬂlazre pass pat-
terns. But in the final quarter
he stopped using the fancy
plays.

“We had good ﬁeld position
throughout the fourth quarter
and I was afraid to lose the
ball on a bad snap,” explained
Lewis, remembering the snap

M that went over }Iavern’s head

in the third’ quarter for a 16
yard loss. “I wanted to play it
safe.”

“But our rush was terrible,”
added Lewis. “We’ve had a poor

pass defense all year and have-
~n’t had enough time to practice
i-t. But the kids (played well.
They made it into a good foot-
ball game.”

Basketball Spurned Temporarily
As N alponick Psyches For State

by ROY JACOBS

Basketball is breathing
hard down the neck of the
fast closing football season.
In reality, Paul Naponick may
be caught in the middle, but his
/inspired performance in Saartur-
day’s near upset of Army shows
that he is still thinking football.

Naponick, subbing for fellow
usopho-more Bob Ellis, was one
of the Panthers’ de-fe-nsiv-e he-
noes. In that hectic fourth period,
when the defense was nursing a
12-7 lead, Paul rocked Cadet
,qu«arterba~ck Steve Lindell for a
10 yard lo-s-s, creating a seem-
ingly‘ insurmountable fourth and
16 silt-uation.

Somehow Army made the first
-down and had goal to go on the
one. Again Naponick eluded
Army’s blockers and stopped
fullback Charley Jarvis before

T he could score the go ahead

touchdown for the Cadets. But
Army went in fo-r the score on
the next play,

“I thought we were in pretty
good shape after I caught Lin-
dell,” reviewed Naponick after-
wards. “I thought we stopped
them then.

“I still thought we had a good
chance to hold them at the goal
line,” he continued. “We held
Csonka and Notre Dame, why
not Army? I think we can match
our goal line defense against
any other in -the country.

Paul, and the rest of the de-
fense, will get a chance to do
just that this Saturday at Penn
State. Last week the Nittany

SOPHOMORE PAUL NAPONICK, shown here against Syracuse, made-
several key stops against Army, Saturday. Naponick, a defensive end,

Notre Dame, and Army, is one of the nation’s best.

fense to topple previously unde-
feta-ted North Carolina State.
PSU, like the Panthers, features
a lot of sophomores.

“They have more upperclass-
men mingled with the sopho-
mores,” analyzed Naponick. “If
you take our offense for exam-
ple, we could have as many as
nine sophomores at once. If one
gets excited, the rest might get
excited too. On Penn State, the
upperclassmen can calm the
sophomores down.” Paul also
used the Panther defensive unit
as an example where veterans
in the lineup  compensate

 

for a sophomore’s mistakes.

Although he’s thinking about
Penn State game now, Paul also
-realizes the proximity of basket-
ball season. And every day of
football practice means one les.s
of basketball.

“I’m two months behind every-
one else,” ﬁgured Paul. “The
-thingthat helps me is that there
are only four games before
Christmas. I should reach my
peak by late January," But he
can’t really look that far ahead.

Nobody looks past a tradition-
al rival.

Tonight At 8 P.M.

Varsity-Frosh Cagers Clash

In Annual Benefit Game

by MIKE BROURMAN

How much has the varsity
basketball team improved
over last year? And, how
good are this year’s freshman
cagens? This questions should
be at least partially answered to-
night when the teams collide at
the Field House. '

This is the third annual bene-
ﬁt game for the N-altional Bas-
ketball Hall of Fame. 'Ili.poff is
at 8 p.m. and admission is free.

Thus far, both - varsity coach
Bob Cllimmons and frosh tutor
Tlim Grgu-ri-ch have displayed op-
timism in -discussing their teams.
Both, however, should get a bet-
ter view tonight.

In the last two meetings, the
frosh have battled the varsity
right down to the wire, losing
both in the ﬁnal minutes. Last
year they lost by .a. single point.

Now Timmons has the fresh-
men from thos-e two teams on
his vamslity, and he forsees a
brighter round ball future ahead.

“We have a pretty well-bal-
anced ballclub,” Timmons notes.
“I think two seniors, three jun-
iors and four sophomores is a
pretty good blend. We're bigger
than we have been in the last
few years, and we have more
-depth. I'm optim-.istic.”

So is freshman coach Tim
Grgurich, and he doesn't con-
cede anything to the varsity.
“We'll do okay,” he insists. “The
boys are working real well to-
gether. They’ve all been doing a
real $00.1 Job-’.’  _ ._ _

Grgurich admitted that he
doesn’t know whether his »teaJn
will do as well as it did last
year against the varsity. “This
is an ‘entirely different type of
ballclub. Last year we were big
and strong. This year we are
quicker.”

Glrgurich  not «without height,
however. Center Bob Gailius

the two Indianaibred forwards,
Mike Riggle and Tom Withers,

thovugh his Pitt News “Hawks”
were ﬁnding it rough going in

Quarterback George “Mous-

would win. He was so sure he
threw four i.nterceptions to keep
his opponents in the game.

Toupeed linebacker Roy
“Jvumvp-Shot” Jacobs was so sure
that the Hawks would win that
he dropped a su.re interception.
Dan “Hands” Lichtenstein was
so sure «that he "stayed in bed.
Mike “Hawk” Brourm-an was

Hawks would win.

scrimmages they have downed

After Rutgers, the cagers will
compete in th-e Steel Bowl, Dec.
8 and 9, at the Civic Arena. This
year, the Steel Bowl is spon-
sored for the ﬁrst 'time by the
Dapper Dan Oharities, and they
have promised to upgrade the
quality of the tournament.

Besides. the cagerxs and Du-
quesne, this year’.s tourney will
include Massachusetts and Air

of the four new teams in what
Timmons refers to as .a. “modi-
ﬁed schedule.”

Two powerhouses, Sat. J ohn’s
and Davidson, have been drop-
ped, and their spots have been
taken by Tulane and Baldwin-

CHARITY BENEFIT

At halftime of tonight's
game, a. collection will be
taken up for the National

similar collection was taken at
the Notre Dame game by Sig-
ma Chi and Theta Chi for the
Olympic fund and netted $3,-

Yogis Take Defeat Hard
As “Beulah’s” Lead Soars

“This contest,” squawked -G-eorge “Moustachi-0” Lies,

“is the most inane thing that I’ve ever heard o‘ .”.
The “Moustache’s” blurbling was typical of this week’s Yogi’s
as they witnessed, of all things, Ilinda “Beulah” G-old.-stein take an
almost in.-surmountable lead. The Yogis all had long explanart-ions

ready, all relating to the stupid-
ity of the contest.

“*Moustach.i-o” delivered a ser-
men on how “Beulah’s” sticking
with the favorites was an ‘ex-
ample of “crude, establishment
confonrnrity” as contrasted with
his “free-living, hippie (losing)
choices.”

Jay “Flatbush” Rosenstein ex-
pounded on a theme of “Under-
dogs and Civil Disobedience -
Thorea.u’s View.” The Kid from
Brooklyn explained that “Izzy
Thoreau is my butcher and
bookie.”

And Mike “Hawk” Brourm-an
-sought to compare the Yogi con-
test to the “God is Dead” con-
troversy. Holding the audience
of three spellbound, “Hawk's”
co-nclusion was that “God is
alive and playing linebacker for
Purdue."

Despite their sermons, the
Y-ogis h-ave not quite given up.
“I consider “Beulah” a non-en-
tity,” squealed the “Hawk.” He
then shrieked that “as far as
I’m concerned, it's between me
and “Moustache” in this stupid
thing.”

“Moustachlo” was _ properly

 

  

with the “Hawk” and let it be
known with a terrifying “What
did he say?”

Elven “Flatb-ush” thought that
he had a chance. “After all, des-
pite all those nasty rumors, I
am the boss, and I can do what-
ever I want.” It’s the same line
“Fllatbush” has been trying with
«girls, and he has had about the
same amount of success with
them as in the Yogi contesrt.

Meanwhile, “Beulah” mum-
bled something about being “too
busy to talk to the press,” and
left for home after a long 15
minute working day.

Bill Nichols clinched the
intramural squash champion-
ship Friday by defeating Bob
Salembier, 9-15, 15-5, 15-9, and
15-13.

For any other interested
squash players, Monday, Nov.
27, at 1 p.m., the Rev. Bob
Heatherington, third - ranked
nationally, singles player, and
Bill Danforth, first-ranked
national, doubles player, will
conduct a. squash clinic.‘ The
clinic will be conducted at
Fitzgerald Field House.

Richey Leads Harriers
Against Strong Foes  

In Today’s IC4A Meet

by ART ROSENGARTEN

Today is an important day
in the lives of the freshmen
cross country team. In New
York’s Van Cortland Park,
at 1 p.m., they can bring
prestige to themselves and the
University with a ﬁne perform-
ance at the IC4A cross-country
meet.

Also running in the IC4A’s
will be senior Paul Grieg, the
valrslityﬁs lone representtive at
the meet. It will be Greig’s ﬁnal
cross country run; he graduates
this year.‘ _

The freshmen have worked
hard in preparation for this
meet. Since their last meet, a
victory over Penn State, they
have been working out twice
daily for two weeks. Coach Jim
Banner said, “The freshmen
have looked pretty good in prac-
tice, but you can never tell what
can happen in a meet as big as
this.”

Over 20 teams are entered in
the IC4’s. These schools repre-
sent some ofthe lﬁnest track
and cross-country teams -in the
East. Villanova. is a heavy fav-
orite to repeat _as varsity team
title holders. The Harvard frosh
are expected to be co-favorites
with =the freshmen squad.

Coach Banner, who does not
have ‘information on all the
schools runnin-g in the meet,
does know two things about the
Harvard team. “'_I‘hley have no-
body truly outstanding, like a
Richey, but they do have very
good grouping,” he explained.
According to Banner, “Group-
ing is one of the freshmen’s
weakness, and in order to win,
they must improve greatly «their

Pittsburgh International Open

Show Features Kinetic Art

by BEVERLY LOY TAYLOR

This year the Pittsburgh
International offers two
floors of Works that strongly
emphasize the kinetic qual-
ity. ‘

The contemporary art
show, being held in the Carne-
gie Institute Musem of Art un-
til Jan. 7, 1968, exhibits the
works of artists from more than
30 countries.

One room on the third ﬂoor
is a light show, featuring blink-
ing neon light works, spinning
llighlts, and undulating strips of
metal. Included in this room is
Cllaes Orldenb=urg’s Pool Balls, a
set of pool balls, eight ball, and
Holder proportional in size to
the room, not to a table.

Also included in this room is
a work by Virgil Cantini, pro-
fessor of ﬁne arts at the Uni-
versity, entitled Man and Space,
a metal mobile.

Apparently this room is not
the place to spend the entire
day. The guard on duty in there
regularly rubbed his temblles
and eyes emitted a. groan or
two.

Many of the sculptures look
like fun ideas for a playground.
One work, entitled Blue Striped
Meander, is a metal candy stick
pushed together into a sliding
(board. Another sculpture,
SSSSSSS, No. 1, is 223 inches
high with climbing bars inside.

Three and One, a. work by
Venezuelan Rafael-Jesus Soto,
consists of a. painting‘ of thin
black and white stripes with an
attached series of read-like met-
al -pieces arranged into a mobile
unit. If one approaces the work
in a. zizagging walk, the strips
combine with the stripes and

- form fascinating shapes and

movements.

, Also on the third ﬂoor stnange
creaking, ticking, and whinning
‘noises can be heard that they
come from a sculpture entitled
One Hundred and Eighty-Two
Balls on Two Opposing'Planes
by Pol Bury. ‘

One show-goer, a young girl
with long hair and wearing blue
jeans, sat mesmerized before
this work for a long tim~e.VFin-
ally, two little old ladies ap-

‘ preached her, inspected her care-
. fully,

and when she ﬁnally
-twitched her nose, jumped back

 
 

startled. 'I'hey’d thought she was
a piece of hippie sculpture.
The Pittsburgh International
includes works by such artists
as Andrew Wyeth, Alexander
Calder, Andy Warhol, Max Er-
nst, Manuel Rivera, and Picas-
so. In addition to ‘these estab-
lished artists, many artists are
represented who have not even
begtm to make a reputation.

Most of the paintings and sculp
tures in the exhibition are for
sale.

The Rittsburgh International
is a sh-ow that should be seen
two or three times. The price
is a reasonable one (50 cents or
free for students with ID cards)
and the hours are generous
(weekdays 10 am. to 9 p.m. and
Sundays 2 to 5 p.m.).

  Ho11ywood’s “Camelot” i

Love It With Its Faults

If you’re like me and dig
knights in shining armor you've
been waiting for eight years,
ever since Camelot opened on
Broadway for a movie of it to
be made. If you’re like me when
the casting for the movie of
Richard Harris as A-rthu-r, Va-
nessa Redgrave als Guinevere,
and France Nero as Lancelot
was announced you moaned be-
cause it wasn't the original cast
of Richard Burton, Julie An-
drews, and Robert Goulet. And
if you’re like me you went to
see it anyway as soon as it
opened. I

The movie version of Came-
lot is able to make up for a
great many things that were
missing lfrom the show. There
are real live jousts, extensive
photographic tricks to enhance
its tone which sometim-es ap-
proaches mysticism, and, of
-course, a cast of thousands.

However, there are some very
real faults that are inherent in
making. a -movie of .a show that
has been popular for eight years
and Camelot does suffer fro.-m
most of them. First, there is a
very pronounced tendency to-
wards melodnama. Second, there

is an attempt not only to make
the characters bigger than life,
but also bigger than the char-
acters -in the show.

Third, it is well known that
Camelot was the favorite show
of the late President Kennedy.

Anyway, the casting is sur-
prisingly good. Harries plays Ar-
thur with a just and long suf-
fering kingliness. Nero plays
Lancelot with a boyish exuber-
a.nce that characterized Gou'let’s
performance previously. I

Vanessa Redgrave is fantastic.
Although she is certainly not in
a musical class with Julie An-
drews, she is my personiﬁcation
of the Guinevere character. Va-

nessa has evloved a good bzirtchx

screen image for herself an
brings it home with a force that
would seem to propel her into
the Quad on a Saturday night
‘waiting to be fought over by
at least a dozen frat rats.

So, if you like nice romances,
accompanied by a marvelous
musical score and especially if
you can afford three bucks a

throw, go see Camelot. You’ll ,_

love it anyway.
