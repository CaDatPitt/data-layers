To the tunes of Middle Eastern music,
Sodexo employees unveiled Turkish
baked macaroni, Djaj chicken and
Bamia stew —just_ a few of the fresh
items newly inducted onto Market
Central’s menu.

Signs in both Arabic and English
marked these halal items — foods
considered “lawful” under Islamic
guidelines —— at Magellan’s Tuesday.
Market Central will now permanently
serve halal foods Monday through

Friday from 11 am. to 2 p.m. Quick-
Zone in Litchﬁeld Towers is also sell-
ing halal foods. The new additions
come after students from Pitt’s Mus-
lim StudentAssociation proposed the
idea earlier this semester to Sodexo
at a Food Committee meeting hosted
by two Student Government Board
members. .

V The additions bring more options
to campus that comply with halal,

-supplementing ﬁsh dishes and other

items that comply with Islamic re-
quirements incidentally.
“Students are our employer. We’re

   

. all about providingwhat the students
are asking for,” said Abdou Cole,the
general retail manager of Pitt’s Din-
ing Services. R

Market Central Head Chef Matt

‘ ‘Mantini said that Midamar Halal, a.

halal food company based in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, provides Pitt with the
food. Last week, the University re-
ceived 500 pounds of food from the
company. »
Junior Raheel Haque, a member
of the Muslim Student Association,
explained that the way the animal
is slaughtered sets halal food apart.

Market Central features new halal dishes

When killing the animal, the proces-
sordrains the blood faster than he
would the normal process. He is also
required to turn the animal’s head
away from the knife before decapi-
tation to keep the process to". be hu-
mane, and thus in line with dietary

' guidelines. Because the animal does

not see the knife, its adrenaline levels
do not skyrocket. A

“I think it’s important because
Muslim students on campus  have
been eating tuna and ﬁsh seven days
per week. It really limits the options,”
Haque said. '

Occuprers
protest on
campus

Josh Won
For The Pitt News

On Tuesday night, traffic on Fifth
and Forbes avenues was blocked not
by an excess of vehicles, but by pro-
testers from the Occupy Pittsburgh
movement.

Paradingpast traffic lights down
the median lines of roads from McK-
ee Place to Craig Street, more than 90

_ people marched throughout Oakland

for more than an hour to protest the
political voting system and economic
policies. A

As part of me Occupy Pittsburgh
movement, protesters gathered
around 8 p.m. last night at Schenley
Plaza, donning bullhoms, bandannas
and bongos. The protest began after
the closing of the polls for the day’s
municipal and county elections. The
movement aimed to call attention to
corruption inthe electoral process by
corporations, among other issues.

Since Oct. 15, more than 200
Occupiers have resided in the space
on Mellon Green Downtown. The
movement has continued to grow

4 since its inception more than three

weeks ago. Tuesday night marked the
second Occupy Pittsburgh protest
through Oakland. In contrast to last
Wednesday’s similar—sized protest,
police last night did not order the

’ protesters to get off the streets.

Carolyn Elliot, a graduate student
studying poetry and education at
Pitt, marched through the streets
carrying a sign that read, “Don’t just
vo/te, march.” She said that she has
participated in Occupy Pittsburgh
since its beginning in support of the
Occupy Wall Street movement. -

Food Committee brings change

Market < 1

Under halal food standards, seafood is con-
sidered “legal.” I -
According to the Islamic Food and Nutrition
Council of America’s website, foods not consid-
ered legal are called hararn foods. These foods
include pork, animals improperly slaughtered,
birds of prey and alcohol.

A week after Haque and sophomore Louie
Al-Hashirni proposed the halal food addition
to Sodexo, Cole said he met with members of
the MSA and brought two more organizers to-
gether — Mantini and Kristen Lauteri, markets
ing manager on campus.

“We form a little halal committee,” Cole.
said, highlighting the importance of students
approaching Dining Services with new ideas.
He said that if demand becomes apparent for
halal food on upper campus, Sodexo will look
into bringing the food there as well.

From behind the countertop at Magellan’s,
Mantinisaid he is, excited about the new food
“because it’s ﬁtting a niche that we didn’t pro-
vide for [students yet .”_

Thougli it took about four or ﬁve hours to

prepare the halal food Tuesday morning, Cole‘

said it too “about an hour to destroy it,” refer- '

ring to the 200 out of 600 servings devoured
by student Market—goers within the ﬁrst 50
minutes ofMagellan’s opening.

Board memberjames Landreneau,whoruns .

the Food Committee with fellow board member
Emily Hoover, said that the committee helps
bring changes such as the new halal foods‘7to
campus eateries; The Food Committee holds
meetings between Sodexo andstudents

“I hope that next year’s Board will continue

on with these meetings. The students not only

ings] , but they also like to knowthat they’re kind ' 1' .

movement is assembly-led and that citizens
came and garnered public action strictly as
part of a grassroots movement.

“Economy isn’t beneﬁting anyone except
for those at the top, the 1 percent of the popula-

tion,” she said. “Electoral politics aren’t enough._

Freedom of assembly is part of participating

' in democracy.”

Pitt senior Alex Basalyga, a philosophy ma-
jor, said he simply joined the march to partici-
pate after learning of the event on Facebook.

“I’m not trying to yell,” he said. “I’m just.

trying to be present and open my ears”.

, After weaving through the streets of Central
Oakland, the protesters paraded in circles at
the base of Litchﬁeld Towers, trying to-reach
the students by shouting, “Out of the dorms,

_ into the streets.”

A.]. Walker, who works for a subcontractor
and attends the Community College of Allegh-
eny County, was one of the many protesters
who led the chants with a husky cry and a bull-
horn. Students peered out oftheir windows
with curiosity, some coming down to witness
the spectacle ﬁrsthand.

Freshman Eric Snyder, anonlooker at the
protest, said he had mixed feelings about the
public display, commiseratingwith the frustra-
tion at poverty but saying he believed the move-
ment was “without foundation” in its intent.

As marchers ﬂooded the streets, cars began
to honk and some drivers shouted obscenities.
City police were also ‘present, and they observed
on foot from the sidewalks as well as by trailing
the crowd in a car. _

since Oct. '15, regarded the police as very co-
operative. .

“The police and the ﬁre department have
been very supportive. They’ve been helping and
cooperating with us the whole time, especially
compared to how police [have taken action] in
other areas,” he said.

In Oakland, Calif., police allegedly ﬁred
tear  .at a similar Occupy rally, injuring a
protesting veteran. This incident brought the
Occupy Pittsburgh movement to the Pittsburgh
neighborhood of Oakland last week, where
the protesters marched in solidarity with the
injured California veteran, Scott Olsen.

Coleman said Tuesday night’s event was a
success, garnering many spectators in Oakland
and providing a “thoroughly exciting” example
of a political outcry for students throughout
the area.

As far as future events for Occupy Pitts-
burgh, details are still in the works. Coleman
has been helping to coordinate a global lives-
trearn through occupypittsburgh.org in con-
junction with Occupy Dublin. This international
public statement will supposedly take place
this Saturday Downtown at Grant and Sixth
streets. H

All of the protesters are expecting big
things from the movement. Megan Warren,
who attended the rally with her husband and
two children, said simply voting isn’t enough
anymore. _

“I don’t vote because I don’t want to support
any ﬁmded politician,” she said as she wheeled
her 3-year-old daughter in a stroller down the
center of Fifth Avenue amidst cries of, “Power
for the people.” I

Board talks elections despiteabsent, late candidates

Michael Ringling
Staﬁ Writer

In a little more than a week, Pit_t’s stu-
dent body will vote for its next Student
Government Board, the governing body
in charge of allocating more than $2 mil-
lion in student activities funds to various
student organizations. _
Talk of the upcoming Board elections
took up much of Tuesday’s SGB meeting in

Nordy’s Place that lasted less than a half 4

an hour. Elections Chair Kari Rosenkaimer
announced the schedule for the week prior
to the election on Nov. 17 to an audience
of fewer than 10 listeners and an incom-
plete Board.

At the beginning of the meeting, Presi-
dent Molly Stieber and six Board members
were present. Board members John Hasley
and James Landreneau, the two candidates
for president in the upcoming SGB elec-

 

tion, were absent. Before the meeting,

Stieber said that Hasley’s absence was A

unexcused, and Landreneau’s absence was
excused. Hasley came to the meeting later,
about ﬁve minutes after it began.

According to SGB’s constitution, a
Board member may be dismissed from
office by a two—thirds majority vote if he
or she is absent from four ormore public
meetings “without excuse or adequate
justification.”

Stieber saidthat what is considered
“excused” and “unexcused” is up to her
discretion, and that she told-the Board
members at the beginning of their term
that they were allowed four absences.‘ Last
week, Hasley was absent from his ﬁfth SGB
meeting, and the absence was considered
unexcused because he was campaigning,
Stieber said.

“If any repercussions are taken, they
will be taken by the Board,” Stieber said.
“It’s my job to keep track. Its [the Board’s]
job to take action.”

Board member Hasley said that he
spoke with Stieber after the meeting about
the absence, and that sheunderstood
because of (her presidential campaigning
experience. -

“I hate to miss these meetings  [but 4

the Board members] all understand cam-
paign season is pretty intense,” Hasley
said. “I would like to be there, but I’ve
got to get my campaign message out to as
many students as possible.”

After four of the seven present Board
members gave their reports, Rosenkaimer
said that students can vote for members

. of the 2012 Student Government Board

from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on.Nov. 17. Rosen-
kaimer said that students can casttheir
votes either by logging .onto my.pitt.edu
or by going to various locations scattered
around campus. Polls will stay open from
9 a.m. to‘11 a.m. in Towers Lobby, from
11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in Sutherland outside
of the Perch, and from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. in
Market Central. ‘

The ﬁrst of the “Meet the Candidates” "

events will kick off Friday at the Perch
from 2 p.m. until 4 p.m. On Wednesday,
Nov. 16, the candidates will be in Market

_ Central from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. for the second

“Meet the Candidates” event.

Hasley and Landreneau will face off at
a presidential debate in Nordy’s Place on
Tuesday, Nov. 15, at 7:30 p.m. Rosenkaimer
and Stieber will host the event, but Rosen-
kaimer encouraged students to attend, ask
questions and facilitate discussion.

While Rosenkaimer said that slates and
candidate information will not be pro-
vided on m  until Nov. 15, she
has created a Facebook page, “Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Student Government
Election,” where students can view this
information. -

EDITORIAL

 Mark,et’s new halal
additions laudable

The Pitt community is on its
way to becoming just a little bit
closer. '
Market Central, the main hub
of on-campus dining, unveiled
yesterday a new ﬂair to its fare:

halal foods. ‘Communication
between‘ ‘the’ Student Govern.-~ .
<jm‘ent»Board’s Food Committee,‘-is

the Muslim Student Association

and So_dexo led to the new imple-

mentation. ‘
' I-Ialal foods adhere to Islamic

dietary guidelines and are subject

‘ to a special process of slaugh-

tering animals that is thought to
be more humane. The fare will
appear at Magellan’s Monday
through Friday from 11 a.m. to
2 p.m.

This is a big step for Pitt din-
ing. Including halal foods consis-
tently‘ on campus. gives students
options they didn’t have before.
If Pitt wants to be inclusive to
religious groups, we think it
should go ahead —- represent-
ing student groups and catering
to students’ needs is necessary
at such a large campus. Efforts
like these form bonds between
students and reinforce the idea

that we really aren’t lost in the -

sea of blue and 'gold.»Students
deserve to get what they pay for,
and that’s nourishing foodithey

, can actually eat.

Market has done a great job
addressing students’ dining
needs in the past by_ including
gluten-free fare, vegetarian op-
tions and ﬁsh on Fridays. And
now, Muslim students can enjoy a
much wider variety of halal foods
at their dining hall.

The success of the new fare
is obvious —— students devoured
most of the servings in less than
an hour. And adding Halal food
to a Magellan’s menu already rife

with varied dishes is a worthy
choice. _
Halal foods aren’t limited to

just Market Central either. Ha- I

lal groceries will now be sold at

‘Quick Zone, the small on-campus

grocery store. This will save Mus-

lim students time and money, as

well as provide them with more
food» options. College is a timevto
discover oneself, and what better
way to celebrate and experience
one’s heritage than sampling the
many foods it offers? Non—Mus—
lim students will also be able to
try foods they otherwise would
have little access to.

Although‘ we praise Market’s
newest installation, we also en-

courage it to make sure that it

is addressing the needs of its
customers. It should be certain
that students with any number
of dietary restrictions are being

‘catered to, and it should not opt _

to represent one group over an-
other. Again, Market does a great
job of addressing student needs,
but we’d 1-ike to see the communi-
cation between the student body
and Sodexo continue even after
this recent success.

Celebrating many cultures is
what’s fun about being part of
Pitt’s large, diverse community.
Yesterday’s unveiling featured
balloons colored red, white,
green and black —- predominant
colors in the ﬂags of many Middle
Eastern countries — and Middle
Eastern music. Essentially, Mar-
ket brought a bit of Middle East-
ern Islamic culture to Pitt. g

Pitt students should be both
tolerant and knowledgeable
about other cultures; and Mar-
ket employs food as a teaching
device in disguise. And we think
if students can come together on
one thing, it’s food. i

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

How to become a totally
unique, cool individual

  

; Pau

R AMERICA
a punt off!

  

  
 

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

If you’re interested in ﬁnding your-
self, you’ve come to the right place:
college. As your parents, older
siblings and various raunchy teen
comedies have undoubtedly made
clear to you by now, the four—year
journey toward the bachelor’s de-
gree offers the perfect opportunity
for soul searching, the accumu-
lation of a soul—crushing load of
student debt and wild experimen-
tation of all sorts. L

But what if you don’t have any
interests besides an interest in en-
suring that your Madden 2012 dy-
nasty unfolds exactly as planned?

What if the only thing you’ve been b

experimenting with is sleeping
in past 4 p.m.? If that’s the case,
friend, put down that greasy con-
troller and change those stained
sheets. 'We’re here to take you on
a guided tour of the myriad pos-
sibilities that life’s rich pageant
has to offer. -

To start with, why don’t you
take a good, hard look in the mir-
ror? Are you happy with the per-
son you see there? Unless you’re
nebbishy cutie pie Michael Cera
or quirky sitcom starlet Zooey De-
schanel, your answer should be a

resounding “Of course not!” Yep,
seems like you’ve got work to do
— and, given your brilliantly as-
sembled schedule of “cake” survey
courses and big “blow-off” lecture
classes without attendance poli-
cies, what better place than college
to do it? .

So who do you want to be? If
you’d like to affect a more ‘conspic-
uously “indie” or “hipster” style,
horn-rimmed “fashion” (i.e., with-
out prescription _lenses) glasses
and a pair of champagne-colored
unisex capris from American Ap-
parel will work wonders. Wan-
nabe “bros” should invest their
hard-earned student loan dollars
in a baseball cap with an unbent
brim and an “officially licensed
merchandise” hologram and an
Ed Hardy T—shirt that’s tight in
the arms and loose around the
paunch. '

But the proper attire is just a
start. If you’re going to walk the
walk, you’ll need to ﬁgure out how
to talk the talk. See, those cham-
pagne-colored unisex capris will
only carry you so far — they’ll
get you through the door of that
groovy new coffee shop, but they
won’t help you deliver a killer
“slam” poem once you’re in there.
No, if you’re looking to launch a
completely unproﬁtable hobby

in creative writing, you’ll need to
start hitting the books.

Don’t fret, though — hitting the
books doesn’t mean you’ll actu-
ally have to read the books. You’ll
just need to get copies of whatever
books seem “with it” and “avant-
garde” and carry them around with
you at all times. “Gravity’s Rain-
bow” by Thomas Pynchon and “In—
ﬁnitejest” by David Foster Wallace
are both good bets, since they’re
the kind of inscrutable tomes that
almost nobody has the patience to
read and fewer still have the in-
sight to understand. Acquire these
two heavyweights after reading a
couple of authorinterviews and
some online summaries, slip them
into your messenger bag alongside
your coated-cardboard Moleskine
and prepare to start impressing the
other coffee shop habitués with the
sort of knowledge you can’t obtain
in the classroom (not that you’d

‘ever know, given your uncanny

ability to enroll in courses that
don’t have attendance policies).
Aspiring bros won’t need to
immerse themselves in highbrow
literature, but they can’t just kick
back in their unwashed hoodies,
either: The suite of skills required
for successful bro-hood is diverse
and ever- expanding. From scoring
an impressive “head shot” kill in a

Giving ‘thu

You see it everywhere. In fact, you’ve
done it. Someone says hi and you,
in a ﬁt of nervousness, sneak your
hands into ﬁsts and put your ﬁsts in
the air, thumbs straight up. Someone
says hi, and you give him the double
thumbs up.

It’s an action that we’ve been
familiar with since childhood —
we signaled that we were ready for
the pitch during kickball at recess,
we sneaked the thumbs up to our
parents in the audience at dreaded
band concerts, we even proudly dis-
played our thumbs to the kid next to
us in class after successfully mixing
baking soda and vinegar. But we’re
adults now, and the double thumbs
up needs to meet extinction

Though the double thumbs up
served multiple purposes when we
were children, its uses have dwin-
dled. Now we primarily employ the
double thumbs up as a greeting, as
a signal that we are doing well or
sometimes as an unspoken thank

Of course, these two attractive
options might not ﬂoat everybody’s
boat, particularly for folks of a
more political bent. Fortunately,
college offers aspiring legislators
a chance to experiment with the
coolest political philosophy of all:
libertarianism. Sure, libertai?i;an-
ism boasts an entire complicated
intellectual foundation you could
waste years familiarizing yourself
with, but whohas the time now
that ABC has rolled out its impres-
sive fall lineup? Suffice it to say that

libertarianism is a belief system '

that’s totally 420-friendly and op-

‘'54-.
‘_-M

usesseem practical, they still need
to be destroyed. . ‘

In order to deal with the double
thumbs up, we must ﬁrst deal with
the source. Almost every situation
in which the dreaded gesture ap-
pears involves one or both parties
feeling uncomfortable, awkward or
nervous. When that girl we barely
knew on our ﬂoor freshman year
asks how we’re doing, we ﬂash‘ the
thumbs. When that cute guy in class
tells us we did a good job on our
presentation, we ﬂash the thumbs.
When the professor who just called
us out for texting in class wa1l<s by,
we ﬂash the thumbs.

The solution to this problem is
simple: Don’t get nervous. Or awk-
ward. Or uncomfortable. It’s like
Barney Stinson says, “When I get
sick, I just stop being sick and be
awesome instead.” So just stop being
awkward and just wave instead.

Let’s look at the basic logistics of
the double thumbs up. This gesture
is unsuitable for the modern college
student. We have places to go, people

On a deeper level, the If ouble
thumbs up represents the degen-
eration of our generation. As kids,
it meant nothing — it was merely a
tool to communicate without speak-

ing. But now that we are in the age of

technology, the thumbs up has cul-
tural implications that could harm
our generation.

We are already obsessed with so-
cial media. We are attached at the hip
to Facebook and Twitter, constantly
updating and changing our lives to
ﬁt our media. Since Facebook added
the “Like” button, the thumbs up has
become a symbol associated with
the site.

Has Todd Graham.-»liv’ed up to ex-

head coach of Pitt football? The
heated debate has one conﬂicted
member of the sports stajfavguing

Point: Greg, how can you dis-

outspoken and he’s passionate —

but Graham is. He shouted “Hail to
Pitt!” at the end of his postgame in-
terview with ESPN after the Panthers
dismantled No. 16 South Florida on
national television. He sprints down
the sideline to call timeouts and
wears his emotions on his sleeves.

The results will come in time,
Greg. For now, the measure of Gra-
ham’s success is who he lands on the
recruiting trail. And so far, Graham

has pulled in two huge names: run-
ning back Rushel Shell and four—star

Pitt head coach Todd Graham made waves in the preseason with a new philosophy for Pitt’s football program. Has the new system. and the
hype surrounding it, lived up to expectations‘?

Counterpoint: Everything you
said is propaganda, Greg. Pitt
is 4-5, and Graham deserves
blame.

I don’t know who this Greg char-
acter is, but his incessant cheerlead-
ing for Pitt football ends here.

“We’re a few bounces away from
8-1!” is the perpetual moaning of a
perennial loser.

Graham has been all talk and
no substance. At some point, he is
at fault for his system not ﬁtting
his players. Graham looked at Tino
Sunseri, ripped 40 pages out of his
playbook and never bothered to ﬁll
those pages with new plays tailored

. ; to his quarterback.
Graham is the ﬁrst to admit that
the team needs to improve, but he ;

ited. The Panthers have averaged 
28.3 points in home games this year. L

Final
match a-
must-win
for Pitt

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s volleyballtea1_;z;i’s
postseason fate will be determined
by its ﬁnal match at home this
weekend.

If the Panthers win Sunday
against the South Florida Bulls at
the Fitzgerald Field House, they
will qualify for the Big East Con-
ference tournament, earning the
eighth spot.

Pitt comes to this point having
won its last two conference match-
es against St.]ohn’s and Connecti-
cut. Head coach Toby Rens andhis
players recognize the importance
of Sunday’s contest.

“We need to go into the USF
match-up with a must-win men-
tality, which we have had in our
recent matches as well,” Rens said.
“I have been happy with our fo-
cus as a team, and I expect it will
continue.”

But before the Panthers face
off against the Bulls, they will
host crosstown rival Duquesne
at the Fitzgerald Field Houseivn
Wednesday.

Despite the importance of the
conference match-up with South
Florida, Rens still understands the
signiﬁcance of the contest with
Duquesne.

“This is a big rivalry match fbr
us, and bragging rights are deﬁ-
nitely on the line,” Rens said. “It
is always nice to be able to defeat a
rival, especially when you can do it
defending your home court.”

The Panthers earned a 32
victory over St. John’s on Friday
and followed that with a 3-1 win
against Connecticut on Sunday.
In those matches, the Panthers’
offensive balance was a key to their
success. I

ﬁnished with 25 and 22 kills, respectively.

“When we are able to get production from
all hitting positions, it usually shows in the
match outcome,” Rens said. “It takes pres-
sure off of each individual hitter and allows
them to be more successful.”

Freshman setter Lindsey Zitzke agreed
and noted that a strong offense is the result
of a solid defense.

“Everything starts.with a good passing
game, which allows me to get the sets out
to all of our hitters,” Zitzke said. “Our de-
fense this past weekend was solid, and that
will be important in the ﬁnal matches of the
season as well.”

Pitt’s defensive foundation showed itself
against St. John’s and Connecticut as the
Panthers earned a total of 112 digs, includ-
ing a career-best 21 from freshman Delaney
Clesen in the Connecticut match. '

Defense will be just as important when
the Panthers take on the Dukes. Led by junior
outside hitter Sara Scheirman, Duquesne has
had a successful season thus far, boasting a
17-10 overall record and a record of 7-6 in
their Atlantic 10 conference.

Scheirman led the Dukes in kills last sea-
son as a sophomore and is on pace to do
so again this year with an average of 3.26
kills per set.

While the talent of the Dukes alone pres-
ents a challenge to the Panthers, the rivalry
will add another dimension to the contest,
especially since Duquesne won the past two
match-ups.

Freshman defensive specialist Clesen is
looking forward to playing a local oppo-
nent. ,

“I have heard about the rivalry with
Duquesne from some of the veteran play-
ers, and their excitement is rubbing off on
me,” Clesen said. “There is deﬁnitely a sense
on the team that we want to get revenge

from two consecutive losses and hopefully
gain momentum going into our ﬁnal Big
East match.” '

Clesen referred to that ﬁnal match as a
“do—or-die” situation in which the Panthers

must prevail in order to secure their spot in

the Big East tournament. To succeed, Clesen
stressed the importance of aggressively at-
tacking the Bulldogs’ game plan‘. A 

“Our main focus in practice this week

will be certainly preparing for Duquesne .

but also looking toward USF and making
sure we are able to shut down their offense,”
Clesen said. _

The Bulldogs have a potent offensive at-

tack that is led by freshman outside hitter ,

Valerie El Houssine. E1 Houssine was named
to the Big East Honor Rollin two of the past
three weeks and currently leads her team in

_ kills with 328 for the season.

The Panthers can also combat South
Florida’s offensive production by success-
fully executing their blocking game.

In the past two matches,’ the Panthers
totaled 24 blocks, with 1-8 of them coming
from a season-best blocking performance
against St. John’s. In the St. John’s contest,
Zitzke led the Panthers with a career—high
eight blocks. ' T

“Blocking is such an integral part of the
game, and I was glad that I could contrib-
ute to it,” Zitzke said of her-St. _]ohn’s per-
formance. “Putting up a strong block can
frustrate the opponent, and that is a good
way to disrupt their style of play.”

With just two matches -remaining, the
Panthers are using this week to prepare for
a solid ﬁnish to the 2011 season."

“I challenged the team last week to play
their best volleyball, and that challenge will
‘continue against Duquesne and USF,” Rens
said. “So far the response has been impres-
sive, and hopefully it will only improve in
this ﬁnal week.” 3

Graham steadied a program in turmoil

Point 4 7

And about that octane: Graham didn’t put
up billboards and produce television com-
mercials. Don’t think less of his infectious ex-
citement for Pitt football because the school
improperly marketed the team to wary fans.

The playbook is exciting. They will try
anything once. Theylrun reverses and end-
arounds. They use the wildcat formation.
Freshman wide receiver Ronald Jones has
two passing touchdowns. Are you not enter-
tained? .

Execution has been the issue, not the play-
book. Graham said in his speech to the Oakland
Zoo onjan. 15 that the Panthers would throw
the ball “deep down the field.” He never said
it would be caught this year.

Pitt has sustained too many injuries to as-

ing if Mark May has any eligibility left. It’s a
miracle they only lost by three to Ca” ranked

_ Cincinnati team that blows Pitt out of the water
in terms of healthy, veteran talent. W .
As bad as Pitt fans think the offense is, the

Panthers are fourth ‘in the Big East in yards
per game, behind Westvirginia, Cincinnati
and. South Florida — three teams that had
BCS hopes inAugust. Pitt hasn’t overachieved
this year, but the team hasn’t exactly under-
achieved, either. ‘

players are to blame. But four times? Re-

Graham can bring in all the prized recruits
he wants, but right now Pitt’s defense features
the most talented front seven in the Big East
and a veteran secondary, and where has that
taken the team? Only Syracuse and Connecti-

T cut surrender more yards per game.

The inability to translate talent into win-

‘ ning is the same issue Pitt football had under

since the dawn of time. Oh! An occasional
end—around for six yards! How exciting! If
anything, Anthony Gonzalez at wide receiver
and Mark Myers at punter is a gross misuse
of talent, not interesting quirks in a unique
system. C

Wide receiver Mike Shanahan is struggling

   

'¥
to match his stats from last season, when he
was the second option behind Baldwin. His
yards per catch have actually decreased in
Graham’s “explosive” system. What happened
to throwing the ball deep down the ﬁeld?

At least Pitt football is high-octane for
the opponents, with all the picks and saclcs
they are getting.

And Greg, you’re telling me to be patient?
Patience shouldn’t be necessary in the Big
East. A coach with national championship
ambitions should dominate the misﬁts of the
Bowl Championship Series right away, or at
least not lose to Rutgers. Should Connecticut
really be considered a statement win?

Sure, a crisis was averted when Graham
replaced Haywood. But it seems that every-
thing Pitt has done since then has been an
overreaction to that ﬁasco. Were the Grahgm
billboards and television spots necessary?
The Panthers have hammed it up big time
since he came on board, although the other,
more honest advertising option — “Todd
Graham: He was our second choice!” — prob-
ably didn’t test well.

A 4-5 record is inexcusable. At Graham’s
salary, that’s $1 million per win (because
Maine and Buffalo better come free). Maybe
you’re a business major, Greg, but I’m not, and
even I can tell that Graham is a bad investment
at the moment. W

LeSean McCoy turned in the strongest per-

- formance for a former Pitt player in NFL

week nine. McCoy (Pitt running back
2007-2008) carried the ball 16 times for
71 yards and added 46 yards on ﬁve recep-
tions. He scored on a 33-yard rush in the
thirdvquarter. McCoy’s Monday night per-
formance marks the fourth straight game —
and seventh total game — where he has tal-
lied over 100 total yards. He has also scored
a touchdown every single game this season.
McCoy’s Philadelphia teammate Dion Lewis
(Pitt running back 2009-2010) received
only special teams play as he netted 93 kick
return yards.

Larry Fitzgerald (Pitt wide receiver
2002-2003) ended his month—1ong scoring
drought for Arizona with a 13-yard catch
from backup quarterback John Skelton on
Sunday. Fitzgerald managed 43 yards on
four receptions in Arizona’s overtime vic-
tory over St. Louis .‘The elite receiver has not
eclipsed the 100-yard mark since week four.

Cardinals kickoff returner LaRod Stephens-
Howling (Pitt running back 2005-2008)

‘ﬁnished with just one carry for 4 yards. He

remains explosive on special teams, turning
in 73 kick return yards.

Fitzgerald, Stephens-Howling, Lewis and
McCoy will face off in a battle of Pitt alumni
next Sunday at 1 p.m. when Arizona travels
to Philadelphia.

Darrelle Revis (Pitt comerback 2004-
2006) ﬁnished with two passes defended
and ﬁve total tackles as his Jets dominated
Buffalo. Bills wide receiver Stevie Johnson
—— defended by Revis — chalked up 84 yards
but was kept out of the end zone.

After a breakout game last week, Kansas
City wide receiverjon Baldwin (Pitt wide
receiver 2008-2010) grabbed just one pass
for 12 yards in a blowout loss to Miami.

Rookie Jabaal Sheard (Pitt defensive
end 2007-2010) had three total tackles
— one for a loss — in Cleve1and’s loss to

— Houston.

Andy Lee (Pitt punter 2000-2003)
punted the ball ﬁve times for 244 yards -
landing one inside the 10-yard line — in a

49ers victory over Washington. I
