for Life  

By Leon Fuksman
Staff Writer

Students For Life is satisfied
with the new Pennsylvania law
restricting abortion, but last
night the group promoted even
tighter limitations on abortion
in mock debate. I

“This law is a good start, but
it doesn’t go far enough,” said
"junior Jeff Paladina, a member
of Students For Life.

Last summer, the Supreme
Court upheld the Pennsylvania
Abortion Control Act, which
prohibited an abortion after six
months gestation unless the
life of the mother is endan-
gered. It also required that the
woman wait 24 hours to
acknowledge state-provided
information about fetal devel-
opment, risk of abortion, alter-
natives to abortion and the

 medical assistance’available to ‘

her.

The debate started with the
issue of the 24-hour waiting
period. President of Students

For Life Caleb Cohen advocat-

ed the anti-abortion position

during the debate by arguing

that the complications of wait-

ing 24 hours will not harm the

WPTS starts forum

By Beth Kovaly

Staﬂ Writer

Students can now voice
their concerns and opin-
ions on the air through
“News Talk,” WPTS-FM’s

» new talk show.

Jennifer Sikora, WPTS
news director, said she
hopes the show will
encourage student involve-
ment in campus issues.

“It calls for a lot of stu-
dent participation,” Sikora
said. “I think students
should get involved with
voicing their opinions more
instead of just complaining
to one another. This could
be an interesting outlet for
them.”

Slated for Sundays from
6 to 7 p.m., the show pre-
miered Sunday night. The
first guest was Robert
Lewis, co—chair for_the
Committee to Rally Against
Presidential Perks. I A

‘_‘There was a lot of con-
troversy surrounding the
tuition reimbursement for
the presidents of these [stu-
dent] govemment boards,”
Sikora explained. “I
thought this would be a
great idea for the first
show.”

Sikora said that the,

WPTS news staff
approached the Student
Government Board several

for student debate

times this past week and
invited its members to
appear on the show as
well, but the SGB had
declined.

The first show covered a
wide variety of topics, tak-
ing lead from the tuition

plan. Lewis was asked to I

comment on other types of
compensation at the uni-
versity, such as athletic

scholarships and Resident '

Assistants. Lewis also dis-
cussed the overall motives
for serving on student gov-
ernment and whether pub-
lic offices in general should
be compensated at all.
There were several stu-
dent call—ins, but due to
technical difficulty there

was some trouble ‘getting.

the callers on the air.

Sikora said the tricky part
of starting the new talk
show will be building its
reputation.

“We have some really
controversial ideas in
mind,” she said. “It’s going
to -take a lot of effort to get
certain guests involved and
for us to build some credi-
bility. As we do that more
guests will wantto appear.”

Future topic ideas for the
show, according to Sikora,
include a possible debate
on the upcoming presiden-
tial election.

By Pete Kapustynski

Army ROTC Captain Pike returns from his successful capture of an
enemy occupied island at the Camp Dawson training area,

 

(Editor's Note.- This is the second part of a
four-part series on a weekend spent with
Pitt’s Army ROTC_Panther Battalion)

We woke up at 0600 hours (6 a.m.). The
cadets went outside for PT (exercise). Bob
and I went out for pictures. I guessed it
was cold (we were in the mountains), so I
wore my ﬁeld jacket. It was very cold.

As the people lined up for PT, I was
amazed at the army base. It was totally
silent (very far from cities) and very dark —
no street lights. Near some of the barracks
were lights that shined on the grass for just
this reason — pre-dawn troop formations.
Many of the barracks near ours were unoc-
cupied and dark. In the distance was a low
hill. White mist poured upward from it like
a volcano. I was mesmerized.

I assumed it was the lake depicted upon
a hand-drawn map posted on a bulletin
board in our barracks.

“That must be the lake over there,” I said.

“I don’t know  I guess,” Bob said.

_ “Or else that hill’s on fire,” I said.

Walking toward it I found mist shrouded
the entire base. You could not see anything
in some directions. (Later, I found as the
sun would rise, so would the fog, lying
along the top of the line of trees in the hills

noticed few people showered because they
would be in the dirt and water all day. I
submitted to this braincrushing logic.

It wasn’t hard to figure out what to wear.
In fact, it was written down for us: BDU’s
(camouﬂage uniform), LBE (load bearing
equipment: belt, suspenders, canteen, etc.)
and combat boots. We had to take our
rucks (backpack with frame) containing a
complete change of clothes, tennis shoes,
MRE, etc.

We went out and stood in formation with
the cadets. We were told to leave our rucks
on the ground and march to breakfast.

Sergeants stood inside and outside the
mess hall funnelling people in and out,
keeping them to their 10-minute time limit.
They told the cadets what good food was
to be had and what a lovely morning it was
to be in the army. (I heard this is called
“getting your men motivated.”)

“Good morning Sergeant,” I said. So far, I
was having fun.

We got in line and I was handed a card-
board tray. Someone put a rubbery yellow
block on it. The block had red specks in it.
The breakfast also included’fru.it cup, toast,
sausage and cheese cubes, orange juice
and milk.

The block was bacon and eggs in a uni-

For IbePittNews

The Department of
Environmental Health and
Safety, the Office of

Residence Life and Housing
and Food Services will spon-
sor a free screening of the
movie Backdraft Tuesday
evening in David Lawrence
Hall.

The special screening is
designed to help promote
National Fire Prevention
Week, Oct. 4-10.

The movie will follow a 20-
minute showing of “How Fast
It Burns,” a video that vividly
demonstrates how quickly a
dormitory ‘room can be
destroyed by fire.

Al Laurent, manager of
Safety of the Environmental
Health and Safety department,

Students may sign up to

screening. Members of the
City of Pittsburgh Bureau of
Fire will also be present to
answer any questions stu-
dents may have.

Laurent said that false fire
alarms are not only costly but
unnecessarily inconsiderate
because the fire fighters also
want to stress that they have
families and separate lives
from their jobs.

Last year there were over
900 false alarms on campus,
Laurent said. They are a terri-
ble waste of time, and there
may be a real fire going on
elsewhere, he said.

Although the viewing of the ,

film is free, donations will be

Its T mile Wax and
sudsfor Pz'tt’s ROTC

By Paul Grubbs
For The Pitt News

The Air Force ROTC washed 101 cars Saturday after-
noon to raise money for its general activities and special
functions this semester.

Corps Commander James Polanoski said that they are
expecting to profit between $1,000 and $1,500.

The members of the ROTC asked people beforehand
to pledge money for each car washed. At $15 a car “we
could raise as much as $1500 if we’re lucky,” William
Davis, fund—raising officer, said‘. ,

The Air Force gives no funding to the ROTC group.
Instead, the group must come up with the money itself.

The money raised during the car wash will fund the
ROTC for the entire term. Some of the activities will
include movie night and ball.

“Since we’re doing it ourselves, it teaches leadership,”
Davis said. “It teaches us organizational skills. [The Air
Force] gives us broad outlines, but it’s ultimately up to
us to plan the event.” '

Other than fund raising, the ROTC also took the
opportunity to spread the auto safety message.

The Washington County Comprehensive Highway
Safety Program donated Vince And Larry, the Crash Test

, Dummies, seen in numerous television commercials.

“It would be great to get
some people from the
University Democrats and
College Republicans to come
on and just slam each other, to
argue over the presidential
candidates,” Sikora said.

_Not every topic needs to be

controversial, though, accord— .

ing to Sikora.

Sikora, a junior liberal stud-
ies major, said the talk show
was an idea she had been
working on for some time.

“We’re finally getting it

underway,” she said. “I talked
to my news Staff about it, they
were all very interested, very
excited about it. It will give
[us] an opportunity to do
something we’ve never done.
We’re just going to wing it and
see how it goes. Hopefully it’ll
improve over time.”

Sikora said that her staff is
“brand new, mostly first-year
students” which makes it diffi-
cult to work on a new project
like the talk show. However,
she said she is optimistic about
the shovsfs future.

But graduate advisor to
Students For Life Steve Frezza
argued freedom of choice. He
said the 24-hour wait discour-
ages the woman from abortion

by forcing her to schedule a
delayed appointment with the
doctor.

Other components of the
new law require a minor to
seek written and informed con-
sent of one parent. Cohen said

minors are not mature enough

to make this decision alone.
Frezza said this precludes

women even more from an

abortion by forcing the parent

to go and see the doctor. He

but I thought the food was
quite good. Even the rubbery

After breakfast we put on our

to the training sight. We were
eager to get the reactions of the
squad when it encountered the
op—fors (opposition forces —
simulated enemy) on the
island. Bob and I went" over to

waited for squad No. 7 to

arrive.

And waited. Therelwas a
problem. People stood around
asking each other what the

holdup was. Bob and I wan-
dered over to see the testing of
the rope bridge before training
began.

We were not bored however.
Colonel Cassetori came over
and talked to me about the
training. Then we saw Captain

opposite shore. He jumped into
the water and swam over to us.
I walked over as he climbed

said the cost of parents skip-
ping work to see the doctor

will be enormous.

The new law was first pro-
posed by the Pennsylvania leg-
islature but challenged by the
Parenthood of
Southeastern Pennsylvania.
The case eventually reached
the U.S. Supreme Court which

Planned

upheld most of the tenets of
__f 3\ the proposed law.

Frezza said Roe vs. Wade
stands because women under
the 14th Amendment have the
right to control their bodies,
but the state also has a com-
pelling interest in the life of a

Ready and Cable

College students around the United States should take
a break from their studies and rejoice. At a time when
the cost of living rises daily, it is hardly profound to say
that students are among those affected most. Because of
increasing prices and smaller budgets, all of the finer
things in life are being increasingly taken away from us
— beer, name brand food items and spring break
money.

But at least not all things are that bad — students can
breath easier knowing they can still have their MTV.
Thanks to Congress. 1 _...-

That’s right —- Congress. Yesterday the Senate voted 74
to 25 to override President Bush’s veto of a cable televi-

psion re-regulation bill, and the House followed suit. This

marks the first time since Bush has been in office that
Congress was able to muster the resources to override a
Bush veto. It was a record 35 straight for Bush. Well, as
the saying goes, better late than never. And it could not
have gone toward a more deserving company — TCI
Cable. If you have ever dealt with TCI you know that
their service is —— how can we put this nicely — far from
perfect. The price of cable is constantly going up, and
there is a service breakdown every time the wind blows
— these are just a few of the benefits TCI offers.

With the Cable Bill passing through the Senate so easi-
ly, one has to ‘wonder why Bush would veto it. After all,
the bill had nothing to do with politics. The substantial
one-sided vote proves it. Republican representativefrom
Connecticut Chris Shayes said, “It galls the heck out of
me that anyone would try to portray ‘this as a
Republican—Democrat battle.” Most cable companies
have a monopoly in their areas. Some monopolies such

‘as, gas and water are necessary,  _they;;_,are: regulated
and controllable. Non-regulated monopolies are danger-

ous. They mean uncontrollable costs and unnecessary

charges. Thanks to Congress, with no help from Bush.

we might add, that will change. 
While in the short run we agree that regulation is nec-

essary, it is also necessary to look at the long run impli-

cations that regulation can have. Here is where the presi-

_ dent’s dissenting opinion must be. heeded. Most impor-

tant of these implications is that regulation tends to per-
petuate rather than improve the state—of—the—art. When a

T company is regulated it usually tries to simply meet the

standards set for them by a higher authority. In other
words, there will be very little or no incentive for cable
companies to improve or expand their services;
Regulation of the cable industry is a necessary evil
right now. But it should be done with a plan to, once
again, deregulate it in the form of increasing competi-

' tion. This bill provides for the establishment of reason-
. able rates and protection against chronic outages. Having

dealt with TCI on several occasions we feel this is a great
bill. Thanks Congress. ' -

Debate could tip scales towards Bush

The upcoming presidential
election has taken on a distinct
air of inevitability over the past
few weeks. Most of the country
has assumed that the
Democrats will take the White
House and that President Bush
doesn’t have a prayer. Clinton
has been on the news with a

. sly smirk on his face calling the

president a chicken and acting

as if he would be sitting in the

Oval Office tomorrow. But a

word of warning to all those"

who would become compla-
cent with the current political

. trend, don’t count your chick-

ens before they hatch.
Presidential elections are not

static events, but instead repre-

sent very dynamic interactions
between various groups and
individuals. It is very difficult to

tell what may happen from one .

minute to the next. Even when
all seems quiet and the polls
seem fixed, any little ripple
could turn into a tidal wave.
President Bush’s sudden pro-
posal last week to have four
presidential debates leading up
to the election may turn out to
be a perfect example.

The president - originally pro-
posed to have a debate every
Sunday night from Oct. 11 to
Nov. 1 — two days before the
election. Two of the debates
would use the same format that
has been used for the past few
elections, namely having a
panel of reporters ask the can-
didates questions. The other
two would have the format
which Bill Clinton prefers, hav-
ing only one moderator. Since
then, the Democrats and

.vice

Republicans have met and
finalized the formats. There will
now be four debates, three
presidential debates and one
presidential debate,
between Oct. 11 and Oct. 19.
President Bush’s proposal,
which took the Democrats by

surprise, has changed the face‘

of the entire election and could
easily tilt the balance of public

Michael
Brittingham

opinion in favor of the presi-
dent. First of all, the sudden

announcement temporarily put"

Clinton on the defensive and
gave the president a chance to
regroup after the constant accu-
sations made by the Democrats
in recent weeks. President
Bush also stands the most to
gain from the debates them—
selves. ‘

They will allow him to refo-
cus much needed attention on
the good things he has done
for this country and allow him
to reshuffle the deck and
remodel public opinion in his
favor. The addition of Perot to
the political mayhem may fur-
ther serve to change voters’
attitudes and allow President
Bush to change his public
image.

Though Clinton is ‘widely
considered to be a better
speaker, President Bush has a
number of advantages. Though
the public is largely dissatisfied
with the economic condition of
the country, the debates would

allow the public to dissect its
respective proposals and see
that Clinton’s plan is nothing
more than the Democrat’s tradi-
tional tax-and—spend strategy.
Most importantly, the debates
will allow the neg1ected«topic
of foreign policy to be recon-
sidered, an area in which
President Bush has a clear
advantage.

Of course I’m not saying that

.the debates will suddenly cause

everyone to vote for President
Bush. However, they will be
critical in persuading undecid-
ed voters. The debates may
also be instrumental in bringing
back Republicans who have
strayed. Bill Clinton may soon
find that you can lead a horse
to water but you can’t make
him drink. The fact of the mat-
ter is, the oasis that Clinton is
promoting to the American
people is quickly disappearing
and turning into a mirage. Will
the public swallow before it’s
too late? .

No matter what metaphors
you use to describe this whole
affair, one thing is for sure —
you can never tell what is
going to happen in politics.
The race is sure to get interest-
ing before it islall over. Those
people who are getting frustrat-
ed and bored by the presiden-
tial race should keep their eyes
open. Those Democrats who

are prematurely patting them— V

selves on the back should
remember one thing. It’s not
over yet.

Women ’s  comes back to trash T artans

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s tennis team had
possibly its most impressive victory
since George Dieffanbach started
coaching Pitt tennis in 1975 last
night at the Cost Center. '

Dieffanbach described Monday’s
comeback win against Carnegie
Mellon as “a rare phenomenon.”
The Lady Panthers came back after

being down four matches to one to ’

rattle off four straight victories and

edge out the Lady Tartans by the

final score of 5-4. .
“This was a huge win, psychologi-

cally,” Dieffanbach said. “Very.time_- ’

ly.” ..
Pitt was coming off a tough
6-0 shutout loss to California (Pa.)
and the Panthers now face the
Big East Championships this week-
end.

A good performance at home
against either CM or Clarion
University, whom they play today,-
would certainly give the team a
good burst of confidence heading
into Seton Hall to face some of the
NCAA’s top powerhouses.

Yesterday’s match started out in
familiar style, with_ senior No.1 sin-
gles player Julie LoPrinzi tearing
apart another helpless foe.

LoPrinzi made short work of CM’s
top player, Kinga Czerska, by
beating her in straight.-sets (6-0,
6-1). However, that would be
the only ray of sunshine that the
Lady Panthers would see for some
time. ' 5

Pitt would drop its next four
straight singles matches, starting
with first-year player Alison Baker’s
straight—set loss (6-1, 6-4) in No. 2
singles to CM’s Whitney Weber.

In No. 3 singles, Marla Zielinski

had to fill in for regular starter Erika"

Devins, who was out with a stom-
ach virus. Zielinski’s match against
Stefanie Kukura was a grueling
three—setter which Kukura won (3-6,
7-6, 6-2). Zielinski, who won the
first set six games to*three, was
ahead four games to one in the sec-
ond set before Kukura mounted the

impressive comeback to win the

match.

Kelly Casey/T he Pitt News

Pitt's Julie LoPrinzi battered Kinga Czerska of CMU  the Panther's 5-4 win

over the Tartans yesterday.

Pitt’s Josie Neiswenter moved up a
notch to No. 4 singles because of
Devins’ absence from the lineup.
She played an impressive match in
the higherspot despite losing to
Sharon Rotunno of CM in straight
sets (6-0, 6-4). .

Carrie Voda followed with a loss
to Kanitha Burns in No. 5 singles.
She was also defeated in straight

, sets (6-3, 6-4).

The Lady Panthers finally got back

on track when Tammy Keister
thumped her No. 6 singles oppo-
nent, Cherie Lin, in straight sets (6-
0, 6-1). ' .

Still, the damage had been done.
Pitt was behind 4-2 /going into the
doubles round. Only once in the
past 17 years had Pitt been involved
in a contest in‘ which one team
swept the doubles round to win the
match. On that occasion, Pitt was

team, flight style tournament

In the flight style competition,
each team’s seeds at each level

Pitt head coach George
Dieffanbach said that he felt
the team had a successful
weekend. ‘

“I consider [the tournament]
an extremely positive experi-
ence for our team,” Dieffanbach
said. “Each player had to play‘
two and three matches‘ a day
against very tough competition.
It is still early in the season and °
to have them play this well is

encouraging.”
No. 1 seed Eric Weaver was
beaten 6-3, 6-0 by the

University of Toledofs Brad‘

compete in his consolation
match with University of
Akron’s Rex Reeder due to

The first win for the team
came from James Chronister

1992 championship of the
senior circuit winding down, it
istime for that tenuous but
blazingly necessary world of
analysis and prediction.

Here is a position-by-position
breakdown of the ‘92 Bucs-

» Braves series:

FIRST BASE: Platoons galore.
The Braves’ two—headed
monster of Sid Bream and
Brian Hunter provides punch-

. and-glove day in and day out.

Gary Redus and Orlando

_ ‘Merced give the Bucs a speed

advantage and sporadic power.
Consistency always beats ﬂash.
Edge to Braves

SECOND BASE: Braves’ pla-
toon versus Chico.

Georgia’s Mark Lemke and
Jeff Treadway are a pint—sized
potpourri of steadies, while
Pittsburgh’s Lind is the marvel
in the ﬁeld — not to mention a
decent bat down the stretch.
Potpourri hints of sewage next

to the rosy Lind.‘ Edge to
Pirates

SHORTSTOP: Jaybird meets
his former backup.

The tandem of ex-Burgher
Rafael Belliard and Jeff Blauser
cannot touch Jay Bell’s steady-
ing inﬂuence in the Bucs’ mid-
dle inﬁeld. The fact that Bell is
the catalyst of the Pirates’
offense (sacriﬁce bunts, moving
runners over and clutch hitting)
makes this matchup a no—brain—
er. Edge to Pirates

THIRD BASE: The Stu-Pen-
dous Terry and the would-be
King. ‘

Atlanta’s Terry Pendleton is
the best third baseman in base-
ball. Pittsburgh’s Jeff King is an
inconsistent, former number-
one draft pick. TP reigns over
King-scruff. Edge to Braves

LEFT FIELD: Overdue Barry
versus Rockin’ Ron.

Barry Bonds is the Pirates’

Mario Lemieux — head and ‘

shouldersabove any other

player at his position. Ron
Gant, a star in his own left
ﬁeld, gives the Braves’ an array
of speed, power and defense
— but he is no Bonds. Should-

.be—MVP over Barry wanna—be.

Edge to Pirates

CENTER FIELD: Pittsburgh’s
All-American
Atlanta’s Bad Boys.

Andy Van Slyke, the proto-
type center fielder, is Mr.
Pirate. His hard-nosed enthusi-
asm coupled with heaven-sent
natural abilities make him the
rudder that guides the Pirates’
ship. Otis Nixon and Deion
Sanders hold a major speed
advantage, but all-around they
fall miles behind the wondrous
poetry in black—and-gold
known as the Slickster. Good
guy wins. Edge to Pirates

RIGHT FIELD: Underrated
platoon versus overrated
Justice.

Mid—season acquisition Alex
Cole and Lloyd McClendon are

CATCHER: Mikey and

Don Slaught and Mike
LaVa1liere are the best righty-
lefty combo in the majors.
Sluggo has had the best year of
his career, while Spanky stead-
ies the merry—go—round Bucco
pitching staff. Braves go with-
out playoff hero Greg Olsen
(broken ankle), now rely on
lefty bat Damon Berryhill and
rookie hopeful Javier Lopez.
Edge to Pirates

PITCHING: Miller’s
Marauders versus Tommy and
the Young Rumblers.

Both teams go with three-
man rotations. The Pirates rely
on\ Doug Drabek, Danny-
Jackson and Tim Wakefield.
The Braves will employ John
Smoltz, Steve Avery and Tom
Glavine. Call it better versus
best. We’re not sure.

As for the bullpens, Leyland’s
magic has made average boys
Stan Belinda, Bob Patterson
and Roger Mason a reliable
trio. The Braves’ hopes rest on
the respective arms of night-
and-day vets Jeff Reardo and

Mark Davis and baby-horse
Mark Wohlers. Overall, the
Braves’ depth takes the nod
over Miller’s miracle workers.
Edge to Braves

The envelope, please.

CW’s Wish: Although many
people favor the Braves to
repeat as National League
Champs, the Pirates —- espe-
cially Barry Bonds —— are due.
Bonds, the best player in base-
ball, is so overdue you would
think that UPS lost him in the
mail. But don’t worry Bucs
fans, Bonds will not disappoint
again. His bat and glove, cou-
pled with a strong pitching
staff, should carry the Pirates to
the World Series. Pirates in
six games

BG’s plea: All it takes to win
in the playoffs is two hot pitch-
ers, solid defense and clutch
hitting —— see the ‘88 LA
Dodgers for reference. The ‘91
Pirates are an inferior team to
last year’s bunch but won’t
slumber to the pitching of
Atlanta’s young arms. The
Braves cannot pitch any better
than they did last year, and the
Bucs took "them to seven
games. No Tomahawk Chop
this year. Watch for Bonds and
Van Slyke to hit, vintage
Drabek and surprise hitting
from either King or McClendon.
The Bucs are going all the way.

the loser.

The comeback started in
No. 1 doubles, where
LoPrinzi and Baker teamed
up for the first time this sea-
son to face the CM team of
Czerska and Weber.

The Pitt duo adapted

‘ to each other’s style well

enough to give up only
a" single game to the Tartan
tandem, winning the
match in straight sets (6-1,
6-0).

The next pair to compete
was the No. 5 doubles team
of Neiswenter and Andrea
Passarello.

After losing the first set
six games to three they bat-
tled their way back to take
the second set, 6-4.

The final set went
back and forth until
Neiswenter/Passarello were
up 5-4, with CM serving.
The two Lady Panthers
played the net to perfection

up to match point, when‘

Passarello spanked a cross-
court winner to take the
match (5-6, 6-4, 6-4) and tie
up the contest at four
matches apiece.

Zielinski and Voda
appeared to be on a mission
in their No. 2 doubles match
which decided the contest.
They had each lost their

  

own singles matches and
wanted to take out their
aggression on Kukura and
Rotunno, their opponents in
the deciding match.

The two Pitt players left
no room for doubt in this

one.
The Carnegie Mellon

head coach could only

shake his head as he saw

his final hope for a victory
disappear in a straight-set
(6-5, 6-2) Lady Panther vic-
tory.

The win gave Pitt 21 5-2
record on the year.

“The team with the best
teamwork will always come
through in doubles 
there’s a lot more strategy
to the game,” Dieffanbach
said. _

“We took control of the
net in all of our doubles
matches  you’re more
probable to win when you
close in on the net like we
did today. I am very proud
of the whole team and the
way they performed in this
match.”

The Lady Panthers will
host Clarion University
today at 5:30 p.m.

This will be their last
match before the Big East
Championships, which
start this Friday at Seton
Hall.

with two wins coming from a
7-6, (2-6), 6-5 decision over
a team from the University of
Detroit and a victory by
default over a team from
Toledo.

“This is a new pairing for
us, but I feel that they
played very well together,”
Dieffanbach said.

The only loss Garnett and
Chronister suffered was to
Northwood Institute by the
slim score of 6-4, 6-5 as the
team posted Pitt’s only win-
ning record of the weekend.

“That’s one for the
Americans,” the Colonel said.

A short time later we found
out what was holding up the
operation: lack of medics.

“We never engage in any
training without medics on
site,” the Colonel said.

Someone ran up ‘to us and
said “Medics on site, sir!” to the
Colonel.

“Where are they now?” the
Colonel asked.

“In their truck, sir,” the mes-
senger said.

“Let’s go get them out of their
truck,” the Colonel said, and
walked away.

Bob and I returned to the raft
station. Squad No. 7 arrived
and began building its rafts
according to the trainer’s
instructions. It involved wrap-
ping two rucks (with partially
inﬂated garbage bags in them)
into two ponchos. The pon-
chos were rolled and -tied in a
.way that was said _to make
them waterproof —‘if..done
correctly. Rubber ducks (riﬂes)
were laid on top and with one
person pulling the raft and one
pushing, the squad entered the

. water in groups of two.

One half of Squad No. 7 was
across. They began to set up a
defensive perimeter and to
cover the crossing of the sec-
ond half of the squad.

Excited yells erupted simulta-
neously. ’

“Shit! Shiti” the gunner yelled.
The M-60 had jammed without
firing a shot.

“BANG! BANG!” people said
waving their M-16 simulators .

Then silence  Someone on
the island began screaming.

“The menlare torturing ‘the
prisoner, sir!” someone yelled
from behind me.

“Bring_ that POW over here:
The island is secured,” Captain
Pike yelled. I noticed as the
sun came out, steam had
begun to rise from Captain
Pike’s uniform.

When Squad No. 7 returned,

. _ it broke down (took apart) the

rafts for the next trainees. All
seven rafts were‘ dry inside.
Later I heard that was the
record of the day.
