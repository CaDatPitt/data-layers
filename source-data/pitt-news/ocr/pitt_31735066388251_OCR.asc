Pro-lzfer
discusses
euthanasia

By Megan Bertino
Sta1]'Wr!ler

A pro-life activist told
Students for Life members
yesterday that euthanasia
parallels aborti()n and
should be fought against.

Michael Andreola,
executive director of the
southwestern region of
Pennsylvanians for l luman
Life, quoted doctors and
cited Cxampl(;s‘ of what he
considers to be a growing
and unjustifiable wave of
euthanasia in the linited
States and throughout the
world.

He likened euthanasia to
abortion. Euthanasia is “the
deliberate taking of
innocent human lives,"
according to Andreola. He
compared euthanasia to
Nazi Germany's systematic
killing of citizens which the
government considered to
be leading useless or
unproductive lives.

Andreola focused on the
removal of feeding tubes
from patients diagnosed to
be in a persistent vegetative

state (PVS). Andreola
said euthanasia is
controversial because

doctors cannot agree upon
how to define PVS. PVS is
not a comatose or brain-
dead state; rather, the
patient is severely disabled
and remains unaware of
his or her environment. The
patient does, however,
maintain normal sleep
cycles and has limited
control over reﬂexes.

High-school students get taste of lz_'fe at Pitt

By Megan Bertino
51:11]’ Writer

Golden Key National Honor
Society held its first “shadow day”
at Pitt for local high-school
students yesterday.

The Pitt chapter of the honor
society invited juniors from Perry,
Oliver and Schenley high schools
and who are a part ofthe Upward
liound proiect. llpward Bound is
a Pitt-based program that
encourages inner-city students to

continue theireducation after high
S(‘lt()()l.

The high-school students
started the day with breakfast
and a few words from Pitt
anthropology Professor Richard
Scaglion, who encouraged the
students to attend college.

“If you enter the real world too
early, you don't know all the
things that are out there," said
Scaglion.

Each student was then paired
with an lionor—society student.

According tojimjarvis, president
of Golden Key Honor Society,
the students were matched up
with Pitt students pursuing a
major similar to the interests of
the high—sChool student.

After attending a few morning
classes, students had mixed
emotions about how interesting
the classes were, but all were
enthusiastic about attending
college.

Lamar lilackman of Perry I ligh
School said, “I had a good day; I

learned a lot. I'm going to be a
part of it.”

Guard Fountain and James
Kenny of Perry High School
agreed that attending college
classes was fun and that college
was definitely in their futures.

La\¥/anda Parks of Schenley
High School and laticco Parks of
Oliver High School thought the
classes they attended were
somewhat boring, but neither was
discouraged.

Fifth—year seniors need to notify aid office

By Virginia Brown
$14117‘ Writer

With graduation looming in the ever-present
future, some fourth-year students have
discovered that they will need an extra year in
order to complete the requirements for a

degree.

These students often overlook the option of

financial aid.

For these students, it is very important that
they determine early if they will indeed need
a fifth year to complete their degree. The
deadline to file for financial aid is April 1.

According to Kevin Altimari, an employee at
the financial-aid oflice, it is important that

these students

graduate.

“meet
deadline, for part ofthe financial—aid process
is to make sure that you meet the appropriate
deadline with all the financial—aid material."
Often, these students’ ﬁles are inactive
because when they filled out previous
financial—aid forms, they listed the spring
term as their expected graduation date.
This creates a problem for the financial-aid
office when it mails out mid—year financial-
update forms. Students who have listed a
spring graduation date do not receive one of
these forrris and the appropriate financial-
aid materials because they are expected to

the financial-aid

students is that typically in the middle of
each academic year we send a mailing out to
all students based on their expected
graduation date. And what we tell them is,
‘This is the date you gave us, and this is the
other information we have on you. if it's
accurate, fine; you don't need to do anything.

"if it's not accurate, this is where you can
update some of the other information.’ So if
a student were to have told us that they were
graduating in May of '91 and never changed
that, then when we did the mailing right
before Christmas of 1990, we would not
have contacted them. The assumption is that

they are graduating and therefore would not

Health care for bomeless topic of symposium

By Kim Palmiero
sm 1]‘ Writer

The plight of families trying to
pay for both food and medical
care was discussed by over 3-O0
local community leaders and
health-care professionals at a
symposium sponsored by the
Pitt's School of Medicine and the
Pittsburgh Medical Department
Center Department ofConference
Management.

‘Hunger, Homelessness and
Health Care Gaps“ was the theme
of Saturdays symposium, which
was held in Scaife Hall and

included speakers from
universities and the health
professions.

‘More than 100,000 residents

of Allegheny County depend on
food pantries and soup kitchens
for nourishrnenteach month. Too
many families in Pittsburgh are
forced to choose between food
and shelter and medical care. We
are at a critical stage where
support services are losing
funding, and yet there is nothing
to cut,‘ said Richard Steinman.
coordinator of the symposium.
Speakers representing local
charities told of the homelessness
and poverty in Pittsburgh.
According to Robert .\'elkin,
chairperson of a local
homelessness task force, the
number of homeless increased
due to economic factors. ‘In the
805, up to one-third of the
mentally ill were kicked out onto

the streets to save money by the
states. Even today, many of the
mental hospitals are overcrowded
and understaffed. One result of
this problem is that sometimes
patients will be discharged with a
bus ticket to downtown Pittsburgh
or an address to a homeless
shelter.‘

.\'elkin also said homelessness
increased in the early '80s, when
welfare and health beneﬁts to
low-income families were cut.
Drug and alcohol abuse is also a
problem. ‘Many turn to alcohol
and drugs; 33 percent of the
homeless are alcoholics. In the
past two years there has been a
significant increase in Allegheny
County in the use of drugs, such
as crack and Ecstasy.‘

Another speaker, Miriam
Manion, told of her experience
with a homeless man. ‘Every day
when I drive past an abandoned
gas station in McKeesport, I see
Robert He's always there. He has
been going to the soup kitchen
for the past 10 years. He used to
be a landscape architect He used
to have a wife and kids. Now he
just hears voices all the time. He
is mentally ill.‘

Manion, now acting director
for the Greater Pittsburgh
Community Food Bank, says that
her life changed three years ago
when she first became involved
with the food bank.

‘I was surprised toseeso many

Gulf war sparks debate over constitu tional rights

By Mark Smith
Suﬁ Writer

The war in the Persian Gulfhas
brought every American's
constitutional liberties into
question. when the United States
went to war in the past, the
government committed many
injustices. During World War II,
the United States interned 120,000
Japanese-Americans in
government camps. The
American Civil Liberties Union
and a few other voices spoke
against this action in the 1940s,
but today the use of government
power during the Persian Gulf
war has brought about action by
the public and community and
advocacy organizations.

Question: How did the military
apply press restrictions?

Answer: linder the First
Amendment of the Constitution,
the government is forbidden to
abridge the freedoms of speech
or the press. However, the
Pentagon imposed restrictions on
the press corps reporting the war.

All journalists in the gulf were
required to abide by certain
guidelines. For example, the press
reports had to be cleared by

government censors. In some
cases, the censors even changed
headlines. Reporters were
required to travel in official “press
pools,” and they were monitored
by the military at all times. .\'one
of these restrictions existed during
the Vietnam era.

Many media organizations are
taking part in a lawsuit, .’\'an"0n ts
DOD, which challenges the
Department of Defense’s media
guidelines. They assert that the
Pentagonusedthefear of ‘security
breaches’ to oensor the war. An
initial hearing was held on March
7. In a similar case, the American
Civil liberties Union filed a lawsuit
on Feb. 22 against the DOD for
refusing to allow the media to
document the return of L'.S.
soldiers killed in action.

Q. What discrimination have
Arab-Americans faced during
the war?
A. The Federal Bureau of
Investigation began questioning
Arab-Americans before the
bombing of Iraq in January. The
FBI assured Arab-American
community leaders it only sought
information concerning potential
terrorist acts. However, during
interviews, the FBI continued to
question Arab—Americans about
their friends and political views.
Beyond questioning citizens
about potential criminal acts, the

FBl’s inquiries produced
opposition from community and
advocacy organizations.
Consequently, the FBI told its
field officers not to probe Arab
Americans in ways that would
violate a person's rights of free
speech and freedom of
association.

However, several advocacy
organizations have received
reports that potentially
unconstitutional questioning still
continues.

Congressional Reps. Don
Edwards and John Conyers have
introduced the FBI First
Amendment Protection Act (H.R.
50). This legislation would
prevent the FBl from conducting
investigations without presenting
evidence of criminal activity

Instances of anti-Arab
discrimination and hate crimes
have been reported. For example,
Pan American Airlines instituted
a policy prohibiting all Americans
of Iraqi descent from boarding its
airplanes. Pan Am has since
suspended that policy.

UESP provides educational alternative

By Kim Checinski
Sta_ﬂ' Writer

During the 19"Cls. extermi-
degree programs surfaced across
the country, as colleges began
addressing the educational needs
of non-tradiuonal students Pitts
University External Studies
Program was introduced in the
fall of l9”2.

.\'ow, nearly two decades later,
the program has nearly 1,200
students and offers over 60
different courses each semester

Registration is handled through
the College of General Studies,
and CGS students comprise at
least 80 percent of the enrollment,
according to UESP director Diane
Davis, PhD. The remaining 20
percent comes from other
university schools, including the
College of Arts and Sciences, the
School of Nursing and the School
ofﬁngineering. All L'I{SP students
must be in good academic
standing, and (‘AS students are
limited to six l'IiSl’ credits per
term

most combine their courses with
day and evening classes offered
by other university schools.

Judy Hoover. a CGS and L'ESP
student, has taken about a dozen
external-studies classes, usually
mixing them with CO5 courses.
With a full-time lob that requires
travel, she said she needs the
flexibility of a IJFSP education.
But Hoover cautioned that L'ESP
is not for everyone, it involves a
large amount of reading, and
self-discipline is necessary for
success, she said.

Hoover sets a rigorous pace for
herself. On weekdays, she wakes
up at 4 a.m. to study for an hour
before work, she also devotes
many lunch hours to reading or
taking exams at the Kaufmann’s
Downtown testing site. She said
that she misses the camaraderie
of seeing other students.

Arbes stated that he would like to see a Shriners' hospital for

The Shriner Organization is currently negotiating a new site
for its temple. Although Arbes would not comment on a specific

One typical situation that arises
from students not mmpleting this
“W508 is that ‘they come in in
June and say, ‘Well, I'm notgoing
to graduate in May; I'm really
going to graduate the following
May.’ Because they've missed
the deadline to apply for financial
aid. we may not be able to assist
them,’ Altimari said

He said that it is very important
for students to process their
financial-aid information before
the deadlines if they are still
eligible for financial aid

Many students going on for

their fifth year are under the
assumptionthattheyarenolonger
eligible for ﬁnancialaid,Altimari
said. This is not the case.
According to Altimari, the only
financial aid no longer available
to fifth-year students is
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency grants.

‘PHI-‘AA awards students for
eight semesters based on
academic progress, and that's it,‘
said Altimari. ‘The campus-based
programs award students for 10

More no—5molez'ng laws?

If Pitt students thought the recent smoking regulations
on campus were strict, they should be aware that even
stricter regulations could be possible, courtesy of the
federal government.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced
yesterday that it was officially seeking to label cigarette
smoke as carcinogenic, or cancer-causing. Should a
mling like this be passed, cigarette smoke could be stiﬂly
restricted like other health risks such as asbestos.

This legislation could be interpreted to mean that
tobacco smoke be considered air pollution. In a worst-
case scenario, all cigarettes could be banned.  would
mean that “no smoking" would become law instead of
choice. -

The ruling could launch a series of lawsuits by people
attempting to collect damages incurred by their health

problems. The main targets of these lawsuits would be

cigarette companies and stores and buildings which
permit smoking, as well as people who smoke near co-
workers.

On Feb. 1, the University of Pittsburgh prohibited

‘smoking in campus buildings. The new law came into

effect after the city of Pittsburgh passed a similar resolution.
These types of legislation could eventually cover more
than just this one city. Laws such as these could be set up
across the country.
' The federal government, however, must not get carried
away. Legislation to restrict smoking to certain areas will
benefit people who do not want to constantly inhale
cigarette smoke.
On the other hand, a complete ban on smoking takes
away a person's right to choose. Such legislation, even

"' though it is an attempt to save the populace from its own

vices, would be considered unconstitutional.

The Supreme Court has also gotten involved in this
explosive issue. It decided that it would hear the case of
a man who sued Philip Morris, Inc, in an attempt to
receive reparations for his wife's death from lung cancer.
More cases like this could eventually arise as a means to
make others stop smoking.

Americans have the right to smoke, as long as they do
not endanger other people in the process, and they
should be able to have that right protected With legislation
restricting smoking to designated areas within buildings,

Pitt neds real course guide

Did you ever notice that once course description
guides are released, people ask the same questions

over and over again?

Things like, ‘Did you ever take this class?‘ ‘What

was it like?’ ‘is it hard?’ ‘What did you get in it?‘
are overheard at least five times a day, if not more.
So why don't we eliminate the confusion’ It’s about

also be able to handle innumerable amounts of

3. Requirements: Show up at class; do your
work correctly, and take every word the professor
says as though it comes from God, himself.

4. Recitations are the nerve centers of every
stress attack you mayencounter while enrolled in
this class. You will be expected to attend these, so
don't be foolish and register for an early recitation.

the university would be honest about it. We could
eliminate the hassle of add/drop and withdrawal
periods, mainly because people would know what
they were getting themselves into!

Way back when, a system like this did exist. The
Student Government Board regulated at book in
which the ‘truth’ about courses was printed and
was available to the university community. The
problem, however, arose when it was decided that
professors had a say as to whether or not a "real"
description of their courses was to be made public.
According to Brent Saunders, SGB president, “W'na_t
happened was that professors were only allowing
good descriptions to be printed because they
didn't want a ‘bad’ review of their courses. What
we are trying to do is make the description guide
mandatory for professors, so students can finally
get an accurate account of courses they might be
interested in.’

CNN ’s Arnett was not a hero

Ramsey Clark, a known peace

to Iraqi civilian facilities. First,
Clark witnessed nothing. He was

destruction is available. If
anything, the opposite is true.

Additionally,tocategorizePeter
Arnett as a hero really is a reach.
He was allowed to remain in
Baghdad and submit his reports
only because it suited Hussein
and his cronies, not because of
his love of the First Amendment
or acmraae reporting.

NCAA tournament thoughts from a hoops junkie

Men 3 gymnastics captures NICC title, breaks school record »

By Sharon Kerestes
sang Writer

After coming within less than
half a point of the school record
twice this season, the men's
gymnastics team finally broke the
record in the final regular-season
meet. Pitt scored 274.65 to break
the record (272.2) and won the
National Independent Collegiate
Championships in the process
Saturday at Westem Michigan
University.

"This was one of the happiest
victories,‘ said Coach Frank
D'Amico. ‘Of course breaking
the record was the highlight, but
more than that, just winning the
meet. We won the National
Independent title. This is a big

event’

The University of Illinois put
the pressure on Pitt throughout
the meet but came up more than
one and one-half points short,
ending up in second place with
273.05. Western Michigan
followed in third with 272.80;
Kent State was fourth (268.00),
and the Air Force Academy was
fifth (267.70). The Panthers have
been chasing the record since the
beginning ofthe season and came
close a few times, first at Ohio
State when they scored 271.90
and then last week when they
hosted the Great Lakes
Championships and scored
272.10.

‘It seemed like all year we
were going to break the record,

and all year we couldn't put it
together,‘ D'Amico said. ‘We
were dose right from the second
meet, where we had it in our
hands, and it fell apart the last
two or three events.‘

But Pitt started off strong on
Saturday and held it together until
the end. The Panthers scored
46.65 on rings, their first event
and took an early lead. They
followed with another 46-plus
performance on the floor exercise
and then moved to pornmel horse.

‘We didn't hit lpommelsl, but I
felt confident because we already
had 465 on both rings and floor,
and we were well on our way,‘
D'Amico said. At that point, Pitt
was ahead of its nearest
competitor, Illinois, by two-tenths

of a point. The Panthers then
moved to high bar, and lllinois
went to the parallel bars. lllinois
faltered, while Pitt scored 46.70
on high bar, its best performance
of the year in that event. The
Panthers got through vault with a
solid performance, and Illinois
faltered again, this time on high
bar. But Pitt still didn't have the
meet in the bag. It came down to
the final event with lllinois on
vault and the Panthers on parallel
bars, their trouble spot.
‘Everyone was so pumped up.
This was our last event, and we
were down to the wire,‘ D'Amico
said. Despite breaks in two
routines, Pitt pulled out a 45.10.
‘When they added it all up, it was
274.65. I was never happier in all

of my years,’ D'Amico said.

The team record wasn't the
only one to fall Saturday. Genaro
Seveiino scored 56.40 to break
the all-around record of 56.25 set
in 1985 by Matt Peters. He also
scored 9.80 to set a school record
on rings. Severino's scores placed
him second overall in both the
all-around and rings.

‘I didn't break the records by
myself,“ Severino said. ‘Our team
was looking great. They were
doing very good sets, and I went
up and did just a little better. So
they had to give me higher
scores.‘

Severino qualified for finals on
five of six events. In addition to
his second place on rings, he

third on high bar (945) and sixth

on floor (9.00).

The Panthers won five titles in
as many tournaments this year
and finished with a 21-4 record,
the best in the history of the
program. I)‘/\mico said that
without a doubt, this has been
the best team he's ever had. “No
other team that I've had has ever
been able to do anything like
this."

The .\'l(I(Z was the last regular-
season meet for senior captains
Jorge Gonzalez and Brock
Freehling. Gonzalez said that early
in his career at Pitt, he never
imagined that the team could hit
the 270 mark.

‘I'm really happy — more than
happy — that we broke the
record," Gonzalez said. ‘The team
has come up from nothing, and
we've been here the whole time.

us the trophy that we won. He
