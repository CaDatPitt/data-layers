Medical Practice Plans May Need Work

By REGINA KITKOVICH

The medical‘ school's report on
its private practice plans may need
to be rewritten before it can be dis-
tributed to its intended audience,
said physics professor Richard

‘ Pratt, chairman of the University

Senate Council’s subcommittee on
Pitt’s medical school practice
plans. The progress report was del-
ivered by Professor Pratt at Mon-
day's senate council meeting.

Pra_tt said the report, ‘prepared by
medical school dean Donald Leon,
was intended to be available to the
faculty and students of the medical
school and the senate council.

“There may be some problems in
the content of the report as far as its
serving its purpose of being useful
to the university senate ,and...the
School of Medicine,” Pratt said.

“Some minor explanations and
rewriting may be necessary,” he
said, or the subcommittee may sug-
gest that the report be rewritten.

Advising Gets Cuts

‘ By'ROCHELLE STEVWING

Due to decreases in funds for the
College of Arts and Sciences(CAS)
Advising Center, many sopho-
mores will findtthemselves without

‘ an adviser this coming school year,

according to Dr. Linda B'urns, an
advising director. The 1982-1983
fiscal year budget allows for 28

advisors to be employed by the cen- '

ter; this is seven less than the advis-
ing center employed in previous
years.

“I think it will limit the effec-
tiveness of the advising center in
that I think there are important
issues that come up (during the
sophomore year) in advising that
sophomores won't be getting,”
Burns said.

Dr. David Luedde, another direc-
tor of advising, said, “We will be
handling some of the sophomore
students in group registration
appointments.”

Other sophomores may be sent
to departments to declare their
majors early, or be assigned to
faculty members, according to
Luedde.

“An individual can only make
intelligent decisions about what
they want to do after they have
explored some options," said advi-

~ ser Bob Friday.

“What I find in my office, and
what a lot of other advisers have
found, is that, by nature of the cut-
backs, we're forced to pressure the
sophomores into early decisions,”
Friday said.

He said that early decisions
about majors are causing difficul-
ties for many students.

Friday is a graduate student.
working on his master’s degree in.

rhetoric and communication. He
has been an adviser for five years.
As an adviser, Friday receives a
salary of $720 per month, and the
university pays his tuition. All
advisers must be graduate students
within the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences on a full-time basis, and
they must complete an advisers’
training course.

Advisers present the rules that
regulate the academic process stu-
dents, go through, discuss majors,

continued on page two

Pratt added that he won't know
what revisions will be necessary
until he meets with Leon.

Four issues——.budget,‘education,
governance and information—are
involved\ in the private practice
plan question Pratt said, in giving
the council some personal impres-
sions of the report. g

“The issue of the budget is
clearly who should pay for what,”
Pratt said.

The purpose of the subcommit-
tee is to shgw what the effects of the
development of the practice plans
have been and the trends of the
future, according to Pratt.

Pratt questioned the type and
competitiveness of salary scales
used by the plans.

“The report does indicate the
existence of a survey (that) shows
that our practices are not at all out
of line with those of other institu-
tions,” he said, “We would be
interested in seeing that sort of
documentation.”

Pratt also said the private prac-
tice plans may be blocking the edu-
catibnal purpose of the medical
school.

“The concern is whether the
incentives built into the plan in
some cases have diverted the inter-

' ests of faculty and departments in

the direction of health care rather
than teaching and research," he
said. ‘ I

Speaker Says

The plans may have affected the
academic freedom of certain
members of the plans to pursue
their research goals, Pratt said.

“The governance of these insti-
tutions (of the University Health
System) is neither democratic nor
hierarchical. Oligarchical would
be the correct description in some\
cases,” he said. “And this has some
consequences for academic
freedom. '

There is the question, however,
of how much information on-the
plans should be available, Pratt
said.

“You get the usual arguments
one hears around an institution.
(One! side is) that information is
dangerous to the health of the insti-

tution if it gets into the wrong -

hands,” he said. “The other side is
that no information means no
trust.”

Disagreements among council»

members regarding the correct
interpretation of the Planning
Resource and Management System
(PRMS) manual dominated the
rest of the council meeting.

Acting for the absent Chancellor
Wesley Posvar,.. Provost Rhoten
Smith announced that the School
of Education‘ would merge several
academic programs, and the div-
isional structure of the school
would be removed.

Nostate Call

For A Freeze,Yet

By MARK STROUP

William Grassie, coordinator of
the Pennsylvania Campaign for a
Nuclear Arms Freeze, recently
spoke of the political realities
involved in stopping a nuclear
arms race. ~ *

“I think June 12 is a watershed,”

Grassie said, mentioning the possi-
ble political effects of the New
York nuclear disarmament rally.

Grassie said the House of Repre-
sentatives Foreign Affairs Commit-
tee passed a resolution for a freeze
on nuclear arms after the 12th;
before that date, a similar resolu-
tion failed to go through the
committee.

Grassie also mentioned there
will be many referendums concern-
ing the arms freeze throughout the
natiorr,‘ giving the general electo-
rate a voice on such mat/ters.

“Perhaps one—third of Ameri-
cans will have a chance to vote on
this issue,” Grassie said.

At this time, there is to be no
statewide referendum concerning a
freeze, but there is the possibility
that the individual counties will
propose one. In which case, Gras-
si_e said, grass-root support will be
needed.

“We need one person in every
polling area. There is certainly-
something you can do,” said Cate
Van Meter of Pittsburgh's Cam-
paign for a Nuclear Arms Freeze.

“There should be a tremendous
turnout (in November) on behalf of
the freeze, on behalf of sanity,"
Grassie said.

The role of the churches in
promoting an arms freeze was also

lauded by Grassie. He said church .

x

/

groups would play an important
role in stopping a nuclear arms
buildup.

“If any institution can rival the
military, it is the church,” Grassie
said; ' /'

Grassie mentioned that the Pitts-
burgh Presbytery, the governing
arm of local Presbyterian churches,
has endorsed a nuclear arms freeze.
Similar measures have been intro-
duced in the Unitarian and

‘ Catholic churches.

Van Meter said the House resolu-
tion concerning a nuclear arms
freeze will be voted on and proba-
bly passed in August, after the
summer recess. Local congressmen
Bill Coyne and Doug Walgren
have voiced support for the
resolution.

Present legislation and lobbying
are of immediate importance
because of today's level of technol-
ogy, Grassie said. ,

“Six countries have nuclear arms
capabilities. In 10 years, there will
be 30 countries. What we've seen is
a tremendous deadening of the
human spirit (due ‘to the arms buil-
dup) in the last four decades."

By moving towards _an arms
freeze, Grassie said, people are try-
ing “to turn common sense into an
actual possibility."

According to Grassie, common
sense is requisite; political differ-
ences become absurd in a nuclear
war.

“Communists and capitalists,
young and old are all going to be
killed in a nuclear war.

“We stand at the edge of history;
what's at stake is whether there is

going to be history or not," Grassie

concluded.

distribution of studies and the
structure of the university with stu-
dents, as well as prepare them for
registration, he said.

Friday said that after academic
concepts are discussed,- the adviser
and the student can then discuss
the student's goals and areas of
interest. He does not think this will
be possible now that the number of
advisers has been decreased.

During one term, an adviser gen-
erally sees a student for three one-
hour sessions unless a student is
having a problem with a course or
instructor.

Over the past 10 years, each
adviser has been assigned approxi-
mately 100-110 students per term.
However, the advising cutbacks
would require each adviser to meet
with approximately 120-135 stu-
dents per term. ,

Burns said one way in which the
slack is being taken up this coming
year is through the University-
Community Educational Pro-
grams (UCEP). UCEP teachers and
counselors have been trained as
advisers and will be taking care of
advising for 250 UCEP students.

This leaves, however, 500-600 stu-
dents without an adviser, accord-
ing to Burns.

During the early 1970s, there
were approximately 30 advisers;
when enrollment increase during
the mid-'70s, the number of advis-
ers rose to 38 and remained at that
number until last year.

Friday said that during meet-
ings, all advisers have voiced their
concern regarding these cutbacks.

“I think that this is the last place
that the dollars trickle down to,”
Friday said. “We can argue at
length that better advisers are
directly associated with retention
of students, and I’ve helped a lot of
students figure out that the reason
they were failing in a particular
area was that they just didn't like
it."

Friday is worried that many stu-
dents will not remain at the univer-
sity, because they will not be able to
objectively analyze their academic
problems by themselves. I

Luedde said, “I think they (the
advisers) have a lot of concern
about what is going to happen to
the students.”

. In the divisional structure, heads
of academic programs report to
four division chairmen who then
report to the dean, Smith said, des-
cribing it as “an' added layer of
administration.”

Smith also announced that _a
PRMS document had been filed
with the Senate Council’s Execu-
tive Committee for the merger, but
added that a second would not be
filed for the termination of the div-
isional structure-

“The decision (to remove the
divisional structure) is an adminis-
trative decision, one which the
dean has the authority to recom-
mend, (and) that I have the author-
ity to approve,” Smith said. “....It
seems to me that it does not come
under the spirit. or intent of the
PRMS document.”

Pratt, also chairman of I the
Senate Educational Policies Com-
mittee, and physics professor Wilf-
ried Daehnick, chairman of the
Senate Budget Policies Committee,
objected to the administration’s
non-filing of the PRMS document
regarding the abandonment of the
divisional structure. .

j‘Reorganizing the school is
listed in the PRMS proposal as a
type of action that requires a
PRMS proposal,” Pratt said.

Pratt and Daehnick requested
that Senate Council preside-nt
Richard Tobias discuss the issue
with Posvar, Smith and Jack Free-
man, senior vice chancellor for
administration.

I Interpretation of the PRMS doc-

_ ument was discussed again at the

end of the meeting when Professor
James Lecky of radiology and med-
icine asked if the council would
observe its 30-day response dead-
line in considering the PRMS doc-
ument concerning the proposed
termination of the geography

.The PRMS document states,
“All planning proposals being
given serious_ consideration for
approval...shall be brought to the
attention of the Executive Com-
mittee of the University Senate,
(who) may determine that a Senate
review is necessary....If such deter-
mination is made, the appropriate
Senior Vice Chancellor shall be
informed and the review will be
completed within 30 days-of the
receipt of the proposal.”

If the Executive Committee
observed this rule, it would have to
complete its review of the geo-
graphy department’s PRMS prop-‘
osal» in August. Georgraphy
department supporters fear that,
since August is a month when most
faculty members are not at the uni-
versity, the Senate would find little
support for the department during
the review. , ~ .

"I hope the senate will not
(review the geography depart-
ment’s PRMS document) in the
summer, when most faculty
members aren’t at the university,”
said Philip Wion, United Faculty
Co-chairman. I

In response to Lecky’s question,

Smith said hetand former Senate ‘

Council president Wesley Rohrer
had already decided that “if it
proves impossible to get a group
together during August, then we
will stopthe clock until we could
get together, and I suspect that will
be the case.”

In other business, Smith said
Benedum Hall’s RJE computer
facilities will be expanded. Con-
struction of a Forbes Quadrangle
RJE station will begin soon, and
the university is looking for a site
near the residence halls for a 24-
hour RJE station, Smith said.

By MARK srnoup

with people who are interested in

Profile: Fletcher¢HdgesJr., Curator

Unlike many things at Pitt, the
Stephen Foster Memorial literally
stands in the shadow of the Cathed-
ral of Learning.

Fletcher Hodges, Jr., the man
who runs the Memorial, isn’t about
to let the big gray building take all
the attention away from the little
gray building.

Some events the Memorial has
oused in the past include book
‘sales; Plays, classes and other stu-

I’-ht events. Hodges says there will

‘inore of the same to come.

"""”""“‘i40dg€S came to Pittsburgh 45

years ago and has seen his little gray
building undergo many changes.

“Our chief connection with Pitt
now is with the University Theatre
Company, classes connected with
the theatre and events that the Stu-
dent Union has sent over here
because of the work going on there.
There’s quite an extensive use of
this building.” Hodges says.

Before coming to the university,
Hodges worked for the Eli Lily Com-
pany doing research on Stephen
Foster, the 19th century composer
famous for the his minstrel songs.

“I started out with Eli Lily and

pan They were a drug manu-
In urer. I actually didn’t have any-
thing to do with the firm at all. lwas
working for Josiah Lily, Sr., who
was the president of the company in
his Foster work. I came from there
to here in 1937. Iworked as curator
of this building ever since.

“I lived in Squirrel Hill for a year
and I've lived in Shadyside for the
balance of the time. When we first
came here, we moved to Squirrel
Hill on Bartlett Street. Then we got a
chance to rent an old house. We
moved there, purchased the house
and just stayed in it.” _,

Just as in his work at the Stephen
Foster Memorial, Hodges sees
many changes around. him, but

believes things are basically the_

_ e.
'-~~~_“’I'_he block we’ve lived‘ in has

maintained its level pretty. well; it
hasn’t changed very much. We live
on Kentucky Avenue.

That’s a solidneighborhood. Peo-

3 pie go there to live, stay there for
some time and take an interest in
their homes. They don’t tend to
move. There are places around us
where people come and go, but not
where we live.”

Although for the past five decades
Hodges has been entrenched in his
work for the university, there are
many things that tie his life to
Indiana. B

“I was born there, grew up there
and married an Indianapolis girl. I
w retty closely associated with

-i. napolis.”

From Indianapolis, Hodges went
to Harvard University to major in
English.

“I started out as an English stu-
dent. I really don’t know a great deal
about music. I got my teeth into the
Foster work and I stuck with it.

“My background gave me an
interest in Foster as he played a role
in the American scene. There was
not too great a dissimilarity between
what I was studying and what l’ve
done here.”

Included in the Stephen Foster
Memorial is a display, of which
Hodges finds Foster’s manuscripts
the most interesting.

 ’ “If you have manuscripts of songs

I  e ‘Old Folks at Home’ and ‘My

Old Kentucky Home,’ you’re glad to
have them on display.

There are requests for informa-
tion on Stephen Foster and his
work, and occasionally Hodges will
take interested parties on a tour.
Hodges is always pleased to work

Foster’s music.

“People come here and I’m
always available to be of help to
them.” '

The Foster Memorial, however,
has been parting ways with it’s
namesake; events such as the Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival have
begun to make up the schedule.

“That’s not our chief reason
now,” Hodges says. “We have a
Foster program about once a year,
but that’s not enough to keep the
building going. The University Thea-
tre has been making use of this
building for some time and we have
evening classes, classes in speech,
education and music.

“We have over a th_ousand_events
a year that take place here. Itake it a
day at a time;-I act as overseer of it.

That’s the chief event, (to) have a V

schedule set up.”

To help,him in his many duties,
Hodges has a staff of three: a stu-
dent assistant, a secretary and a
custodian. .

Hodges expects no revolutionary
changes for the Foster Memorial,
but expects something to be always
happening at the building.

“We have a very full life here. For
the entire upcoming academic year,
the whole building has been
booked——lock, stock and barrel.”

CouncH-

No Togetherness

What’s going on with the Council of
Graduate Students in Education?

The council’s May 13 elections seem to
have undone its leadership and left it with
an uncertain future.

The council decided recently to appoint a

steering committee that will guide it until ‘

another election can be held in the fall.

But even after that election, there is still
the question of what happened and why. Of
the six officers elected in May, four resigned
because they considered the election
invalid.

Their reasons range from complaints
about improper procedures to charges of
racism. / e

Some graduate students claimed students
who were not active members—and there-
fore were ineligible to vote——nevertheless
cast ballots.

According to one council member, the
elections controversy was the result of an
“ethnic coup,” comprised of “Africans and
Afro-Americans.”

But the council’s problems didn’t' stop
there.‘

At its last meeting, Kamal Dora, an active
member and a candidate for the office of
member-at-large, charged the meeting was
illegal because not all the members had
been properly notified. Other students pro-
tested that some members were promoting
factionism by presenting their views to the
press. »

It’s clear that if the council‘ hopes to be
taken seriously, it should concentrate on
preventing “procedural” difficulties from
occurring again.

The graduate council would be better
served by examining its past mistakes and
attempting to correct them.in the fall.

Whether or not the racism charges are
true is the responsibility of the council to
investigate—not ignore.

A representative body of graduate stu-
dents can be a valuable tool in addressing
the needs and concerns of graduate stu-
dents. It’s up tothe council to honestly
examine its past difficulties and attempt to
resolve them before the graduate students
lose a valuable voice.

By LARRY LUNSFORD
A World's Fair in Knoxville?
Surely you jest! I was among the
many skeptics several years ago
when talk of hosting the fair in the
Tennessee city first surfaced.
Since I left my hometown, Oak

V Ridge, which isinear Knoxville, I

have continued a subscription to
my hometown newspaper, so I
have been able to follow the fair’s

7 progress since its inception. When

it finally became a reality, like a
true native son, I was proud.

The pride became somewhat tar-
nished as I read newspaper and
magazine reports and listened to
television reporters comment on
the fair. Practically all I was hear-
ing was negative.

Even the first reports I heard from
folks who had been to the fair were
less than positive. Did Knoxville
suddenly have an albatross with
which to deal?

My excitement to visit the fair
didn't wane with the criticism I
reading and hearing. I
couldn’t wait to return home in
mid-June and visit the fair.

I determined that I would put
aside the negative comments and

‘ »go to the fair with an open mind. I

was intent on having a good time.

I not only visited the fair once
and had a pleasant experience, but
I returned a second day, spending a
total of nearly 16 hours at the fair!
I figured that many other people
must have heard and read negative
things too, so when they went to
the fair, they were already expect-
ing the worst. The fair, I believe, is
what the visitor makes it.

Having been born and reared in
Oak Ridge, I had a definite advan-
tage over out-of-town fair visitors.
My subscription to the newspaper
was also beneficial in that I knew
what events were coming up the
week of my visit. I had also toured
the fairgrounds last December dur-
ing construction, so I was familiar
with the site as well as places I
could park for free at the University
of Tennessee, which neighbors the
fair site.

I visited the fair the first day with
two professional colleagues, and
we decided to first just walk the
fairgrounds and see everything

Since my colleagues had but one
day to see the fair, we decided not to
wait in long lines to see the pavil-
ions, so we visited the pavilions
which had little to no wait in line.
The latter were few in number!

We had hoped to see the China
Pavilion, which features a section
of the Great Wall, and the first day
we went was the first day that the
fair officials were attempting to use
a ticket system for the China
exhibit.

That wasn’t working either, and
by the time we entered the gates in
mid-afternoon, the tickets for the‘
day wereialready gone. (Before I left
Tennessee, the ticket system was
abandoned, and they returned to
the old system of merely waiting in
line to see the pavilion.)

We visited the Mexican, Philli-
pine, German, British, French,
Hungarian, Peruvian and Egyp-
tian pavilions. The latter two
pavilionsiwe saw 30 minutes before
they closed at 10 p.m., so the lines
were rather small. Those two were
by far our favorites.‘

Even though we understood why
the majority of the pavilions cen-
tered their exhibits around the
fair’s energy theme, the energy
exhibits just didn’t seem to be as
interesting as the ancient artifacts
offered by other pavilions. What
the latter thoughts may say about
us I'm not quite sure!

Even though we found the Peru-
vian and Egyptian pavilions tho-
roughly enjoyable, by far the
favorite site we visited that day was

the Technology and Lifestyle Cen-

ter. We could have spent much of a
day just there.

The exhibit by the state of West
Virginia was better than most of
the pavilions of the countries we
had visited, and the Sports Hall of
Fame exhibit was truly interesting.

The Technology and Lifestyle
Center was not too crowded and I
wondered if the folks outside really
knew how many different things

there were to see inside the center.‘

We capped off the day with a

visit to the Stokely Camp Foods a

Festival site on the fair’s west
grounds. We were entertained out-
doors by country and folk singers,
and we had a fabulous and fairly

'rude people who have been it

Pavilion, but would try to see as
many other things as possible
instead. ~
The only new pavilion Iadded to
my list was that of the United

" States, but we did see the Budweiser

Clydesdales, the Candy Factory,
the Sunsphere, the Federal Express
show and several smaller exhibits.
All the latter, particularly the Fed-
eral Express pavilion, were
worthwhile.

The one event we took in that
day turned out to be the highlight
of my two days’ visit to‘ the fair.
That was the “Sing Tennessee”
presentation at the Tennesse .
Ampitheater. It was a remarkable
production, and I and the rest of
the capacity audience resounded
with applause and a standing
ovation.

How anyone could be bored at
the fair I don’t know. Once admis-
sion is paid, the bestthings are free.

I agree that the lines for some
events are ridiculous, but when you
are dealing with over 80,000 folks
per day, I'd say that things are
fairly well organized.

The fair site was very clean, and
the workers were extremely cordial
and helpful, considering that they
have had to deal with quite a few

with the lines and other thin
the fair.

From the many outdoor shows,
to the rides, to the energy demon-
strations, to the TVA exhibit, to the
walking Heinz ketchup bottle, to
the carnival barkers and their
games, to the beer gardens, to the
many pavilions and exhibits, to the
top of the Sunsphere—there is
something for every member of the
family.

I am more proud of Knoxville,
Oak Ridge and all those responsi-
ble for the fair than I was before I
went. I admit there have been some
negative experiences and some bad
people who have. tried to take
advantage of the situation, but t ‘
good of the fair far outweighs th
bad.

Thereare a lot of skeptics out
there, and I just hope they don’t
keep people from going to the fair
and making their own judgments.

When people ask me how I liked

Striving To Be
The Best

Most Pitt. students spend, their
college days watching only one

-sport: football. They don’t realize

that Pitt is the home of a number of
winning teams, one of which is
gynmastics.

Every year since 1979, the
women’s gymnastics team has been
in the Top 20 of the nation, and the
men’s team, which was ranked No.
21, missed the Top 20 by a fraction
of a point. A

“With one more meet, we could
have broken the’ Top 20,” said men’s
head coach Dr. Frank D’Amico.

Although neither team has gone
"to Nationals as ai unit, individual ath-
letes have. Both coaches believe
their teams have enormous talent,
but lack depth.

“We don’t have the guts for two
or three injuries. Our stumbling
block is (that) we need extra people,
and we don’t have them.” said
women’s head coach Donna Sanft.

Sanftsaid that one of the reasons
the Pantherettes lack depth is the
difficulty in recruiting top gymnasts.

“Penn State is just four hours
away. They’re highly competitive
and have a great reputation. Kids
who want to go to school in Pennsyl-
vania have a choice of two state
schools,” she explained.

D’Amico said the Panthers have
the depth to match other teams, but
he wants to “reduce the range of

Panther Dave Smith practices for ring competition.

scores, because every score
counts.” D’Amico said he would like
to see all of the men score in the
high-eight to high-nine range;

Both of the ‘coaches have definite
goals in mind for next season. Sanft
said the goal of the women’s team is
to make it to the Top Five, while
D’Amico said that he wants the
men’s team to make it to the Top 20.

“Last year in July, I would have

said wecould make the Top‘Five,”

Sanft said. “It was hinging upon a .

certain number of gymnasts. If we
had injuries, we couldn’t do it, and
last year we were racked with

injuries.”

Although “it seemed like the kids
who were left made _up their minds
to take up the slack of those who

were injured,” the Pantherettes had

their first losing season last year,
said Sanft.

She added that it’s A tough with
injuries because “the injured kids
are depressed, and the healthy ones
are discouraged.” _,

Sanft noted that last season was
especially hard because “there
wasn’t one meet where we could put
up a full lineup. Sometimes we were

two (gymnasts) short for each ’

event.”

Injuries and lack of depth are two’
‘of the disadvantages of having a
‘ small team, but there are also some

advantages. “It’s great in terms of
the coach-athlete ratio,” said Sanft.

The Panthers have 14 men on the
team, which D’Amico believes is
plenty. "It takes a lot of time to work
with them‘. Some of the larger
schools have as many as 60 ,qvm-
nasts, which is too many for individ-
ual attention,” he said.

“I would never want too many in
our gym,” D’Amico continued.
“You can’t control gymnastics with-

\3

out discipline."
' Both coaches plan to help their
teams make it to thetop by upgrad-
ing their schedules so they can meet
more good teams.

According to Sanft, “We also

want to upgrade the facilities. Right‘

now, we have a proposal in for some
major renovations. This will help in
recruiting and will keep the kids
healthy once they’re here.

“With recruiting this year and
training, l’ve scheduled the most dif-
ficult schedule that’s been at Pitt.
We’ll participate in 16 meets,” said
D’Amico.

In addition to meeting more

‘ teams, D’Amico said the Panthers

will be competing- against better
teams. The University of Illinois,
Western Michigan and Indiana
State University are among Pitt’s
new competitors. All -of these*

schools are highly ranked, accord-I I

ing to D’Amico.

Beside these new schools,
D’Amico said that “the U.S.S.R.
World University is coming our way.
I’m trying to schedule an interna-
tional ,meet the the Field House.” -

D’Amico said “people want to see
gymnastics and they need. exci-
tement,” but added that it’s some-
times difficult to meet with highly
ranked teams because their sche-
dules are so filled, and because of
the distance and cost involved in
traveling.

He is trying to promote the sport
by “trying for top-notch competition

at our own gym and by not schedul-

ing lesser teams at our own gym on
weekend nights.” ‘

However, there's more to worry
about than budgets and which
teams Pitt will play. Bothvcoaches
have to get the athletes ready for the
meets.

Sanft said that “I ‘never have to
say ‘Do it again." They take it for
granted. More often, I have to say
‘Enough, enough, move on.’ ”

She added that most of her work

' is spent on the job of motivating the

Pantherettes and guiding their

energy. “It doesn’t take a lot of stim- I

ulation to keep them going, she
said.

Sanft believes a lot of the girls
haven’t_ yet reached their full poten-
tials and are motivated to learn
more. She said, “motivation is the
name of the game.” '

Setting long-range and ‘short-
range goals is how Sanft motivates-
her team. “In trying to reach

goals. Our long-range goals are in

monthly goals, we have weekly‘.

terms of what the routines should
look like in Regionals and Nation-
als,” Sanft continued.

Coaching the Pantherettes takes

lots of positive reinforcement, Sanft ,
said. “It can be frustrating, sol try to

reinforce what they did right and
correct what was wrong. I try to get
them thinking positively.”

D’Amico said that when he first
came to..Pitt, he instituted a couple
of ‘principles he has followed since

that time. “First of all, basics and A

technique come first, and secondly,
you should never do anything you
can’t do,” he said. . ~

“Too many high school kids do
tricks above their heads. Before llet
a gymnast do a trick as part of a
routine, he has done it a couple of
hundred times. When he does it in

_ front of the audience, he really

knows what he’s doing,” D’Amico
continued.

He added that “if anyone has held
them back, it’s been me. Safety and
practice are the most important
things.”

D’Amico is happy with the Panth-
ers’ progress during his five years as
coach at Pitt and I is ' especially
pleased with last‘ season’s
performances. ’ I

»’ “Last season, every record set at
Pitt was broken. We ended up fifth
in the East. The team astonished
me;«” he said. , »

Although he described theteam
as “one of -the powers in the East,”
he’s not sure if Pitt will be one of the
eight teams selected to go to Nation-
als. He believes that one event, the
sidehorse, “will be the event that
sends us to Nationals.”

Sanft, who will be going into her
ninth season, said, “Next year, I
think we’ll have individual cham-
pions. I don’t know if we can pull it
off s a team.” 1 I

Such caution is understandable,
considering the mishaps that
plagued the Pantherettes last sea-
son. But, as D’Amico said, “Nothing
comes quick in gymnastics.”

Head Coach Frank D’Amico hopes the Panthers will

make it to nationals next season.

Releasing Steam During

By BARRY ZASLOFF

  
 
  
 

As the summer term moves
oward a finish and Pitt students
a attle the sticky and hot weather, I
ve accumulated a considerable
amount of steam which will be
released on these pages:

0 For those who doubt the worth
of Dave Parker, consider that the
Pirates began their current win
streak once hereturned to the start-
ing lineup. Also, with the excep-
tion of Jason Thompson, every
starting position player has
improved his average since
Parker’s return. Those who still
argue that Parker is not a valuable
commodity and that he is not the
key to the Pirates’ chances of win-
ning a division title probably feel
that trade is not important to cash

ow.

0 I’m getting sick and tired of
seeing the word “prestigious”
preceding the Big East conference.
phrase will never again
appear on these pages—at least not
while I’m around here.

0 Pitt’s move into that confer-

ence has its got Id and bad points. It
will bring more money and better
talent into the program, but it will
prevent the Panthers from gaining
an NCAA tournament berth for at
least the next two years. They’ve
had enough talent to win the East-
ern 8 and the automatic bid during
the past two years, but they are still
not ready to be a contender in the

A rematch with Georgia in next year’s Sugar Bowl is unlikely considering the

Panthers’ difficult schedule.

0 His teammates call him
“Pops”; his fans admonish him as
a hero; his detractors say he only
serves to take up a roster spot. Wil-
lie Stargell is proving the doubters
wrong. Although hisgon-the-field
production has been limited to a
couple of pinch hit homers, there is
reason to suspect that his quiet
leadership from the bench has been
directly responsible for the Pirates’
elevation in the National League
Eastern Division. He has surely

younger players—]ohnny Ray and
Tony Pena—both of whom have a
chance of winning a batting title in
their rookie years.

0 Baseball is dead in this town.
Even now, in the midst of an
extended win streak, with school
out for the summer, Three Rivers
Stadium is about 85 percent empty
for Pirate games. And, to think that
some 65,000 fans showed up in
Denver’s Mile High Stadium to

game. But take solace Pirate fans,
Pittsburgh is far ahead of Denver in
terms of its media market.

0 Watching soccer on television
last Sunday was only slightly more
exciting than watching a Gilli-
gan’s Island rerun.

O The same can be said of tennis.

0 Once again the Penguins’ per-
formance in

the post season‘

A Hot Summer

ranted optimism for the upcoming
season. Hey fans, are you, so
blinded by the outstanding attempt
to overthrow the reigning cham-
pion New York Islanders that you
cannot see that this team finished
as one of the worst teams in the
NHL for the past three seasons?

Q If the Panther football team
were to have the same schedule this
season as it did last, it would win
the national championship. But
with North Carolina, Florida
State, Notre Dame and Penn State
set to do bat.tle with Pitt, a top
ranking will be a difficult task.

0 Auto racing is not a sport—it’s
a way to drive over 200 m.p.h. with-
out hearing sirens in the distance.

0 Why are certain officials, at
certain press conferences, certain to
sound like robots?

0 The recent conference in
which Ed Bozik was named as
Pitt’s athletic director was an
example of the above. It sounded as
if the participants had rehearsed
their lines for at least two days.

eye and says something, the ten-
dency is to believe him.

0, Even though Dale Berra has
raised his average to over .250, I
still contend that he is not a major
league shortstop. His average will

_ be back down around .200 by the
playoffs.

. Viewpoint

By BRIAN BALK

Popularity wins beauty contests,
gets politicians elected and, unfor-
tunately, determines baseball's best
players. The absurdity of the fans’
picking the players for the All-Star
teams was clearly exhibited‘ this
year when once again the selections
were based on personality rather
than performance.

When Commissioner Bowie
Kuhn reinstated fan balloting in
1970, its purpose was to give the
fans the opportunity to see who
they desired.

Tom Baird, assistant director of
publicity for the Pittsburgh
Pirates, agrees with this notion of
fan involvement.

“Having the fans vote is good for
baseball,” he said. It gives the fans
a bit of control, a way of showing
just who the game is played for. It

..is -goodfor baseball in general.”

Baseball should cater to the
needs and wants of the fans, but the
All-Star Game is no place.

The All-Star Game is tradition-
ally the midsummer battle between
the best the two leagues have to
offer. It is a game where uniforms
are ignored and grudges are tem-
porarily disregarded; all that mat-
ers is whether one vows American
or National.

In fact, the game should be
renamed the “All-Best." game
because “All-Star” implies what
the game has actually evolved
into-—the most popular players
rather than the best.

Yes, the fans’ voting has made a
mockery of th”e‘All-Star game and

will continue to do so unless the

vote is given back to the players.
Baird feels that if the players were
given the opportunity to choose
the teams, they would select on the
basis of ability, not charisma.
The errors the fans made this
year are numerous. For example:
Bucky Dent, the klutzy shortstop
for the New York'Yankees, who
presently has a .143 batting aver-
age, was leading the voting almost
to the very end. His handsome
appearance and macho name are
perfect for shaving cream commer-
cials, but not for an All-Star starter.
Another mistake was made when
Pirate rookie second baseman
Johnny Ray was not only absent
from the All-Star roster, but left off
the ballot entirely. Manny Trillo,
the Philadelphia Phillies second
baseman, led the voting with a bat-
ting average of .261. The reserve for
the second base slot is Los Angeles’
Steve Sax, who is presently hitting

-284. Ray not only has a higher bat-

ting average, .302, but he also has

more RBI’s, 36, and more home,

runs, six.

Pirates’ General Manager Pete
Peterson stated his disappoint-
ment, “Ray has been a consistent,
winning player all year, and he is
deserving of being on the All-Star
team." ‘

Then where does the logic lie in
leaving this Bucco star off the
National League All-Star team?
According to Baird, “Even if Ray
got 500,000 write-in votes in Pitts-
burgh, he still isn’t known across

the countrybecause of his rookie ’
status.”

. Fan Balloting Unfair; LetThe Players Vote

The Pitt Neils,’ Wednesday, July'l‘4,,i‘l982. J

Lonnie Smith, of the St. Louis
Cards, hitting .308 with 41 stolen
bases and 41 RBI’s, was ignored.
The legendary Pete Rose, with a
.292 average, was still chosen over
Montreal's Al Oliver, who is hav-
ing one of his greatest seasons ever
with a .325 aveage, 13 homers and
58 RBI’s. It just seems to defy logic.

Baird explains this dilemma of
illogical voting, “Fans don’t vote
on personality as much as they do
recognition, If a fan just recognizes
a familiar name, he would most
likely vote for him. Look at Reggie
Jackson. He has a personality that
isn't pleasing to the public, but he
has been voted in year after year.
Recognition is the key.”

It is obvious that today a player
no longer needs a friendly disposi-
tion to be popular with the fans.
All a player needs is a product, such
as “Reggievision,” or a contro-
versy, such as “Winfield-
Steinbrenner,” to make an All-Star
game appearance. .

Luckily Kuhn and company
realized that having the fans choose
the All-Star teams would be disas-
trous. Thus, they ruled that each
All-Star manager could choose a
certain number of players in addi-

tion to selecting the pitchers. This.

is good to an extent.
Baseball managers for the most
part, will have better baseball sense

than most celebrity-seeking fans,
though they can still be partial to

their clubs.

Tome LaSorda, manager of the
World Champion Los Angeles
Dodgers, is a prime example of a
person who plays favorites, liter-
ally. LaSorda chose many players
who were indeed deserving of All-
Star status (such as the Pirate
catcher Tony Pena).

However, he as did many fans,
overlooked statistical records and
selected lessers from his Dodger
blue blood. He chose Steve Howe
over the Pirates relief ace Kent
Tekulve. Howe only has seven
saves to his record, compared to
Teke’s 11, and Teke has a much
lower ERA. i

LaSorda lowered his baseball
intellect several notches by select-
ing his own Steve Garvey.(.256).
The only merit Garvey can claim is
his, wholesome American image, so
clean that he could pass for Wally
and Beaver Cleaver’s third brother.

The balloting itself is fairly

unjust, but the manner in which

the votes are distributed is equally
unfair. The last Pirate game I
attended, a smiling female was dis-
pensing All-Star ballots.

As she approached me, I
expected to obtain. two or possibly
three ballots. Instead, she handed
me a stack of nearly 85 ballots!

Although most of my ballots were 

used as graffiti for Jason Thomp-
son’s two-run homer, I still voted
for 20 fans. -

According to Baird, the Pirate
organization receives about a half a
million All-Star ballots. The
Pirates are lucky to draw a half a
million in an entire year. Thus,
many fans, such as myself, are able
to vote 80 or 90 times—not a true
way of determining representation.

Talk about stuffing the ballot
box! -

The only viable way to resolve
the problem of All-Star polling is
to restore the voting rights to the
players. The players themselves are
the best judges of who is worthy of
an All-Star honor.

Having the fans decide which
players are merit worthy is rather

a battle strategy for the Isreali for-
ces in West Beruit. The fans are not

in the position to determine which *
players are the true All-Stars. It is -

not that we as fans lack the knowl-
edge; itis just that we lack the first

hand experience of playing base-

ball on a professional basis.

Instead of constantly appealing :

to the fans’ hunger for celebrities,
controversies and charismatic per-
sonalities, it is time we respore the
All-Star voting to the individuals
that deserve it——the baseball

Heon to World Games
trials...

Pitt Lady Panther swimmer Sue
Heon has qualified for the ‘World
Games trials to be held this week-
end. The two-time junior All-
American swimmer will partici-
pate in the 400, 800 and 1500-yard
freestyle and the 400-yard individ-
ual medley.

Goodbye Stan...

Pittsburgh Spirit star Stan
Terlecki may fall prey to the big
money that can be earned in play-
ing in Europe. According‘ tQ_gm
Italian newspaper, an Italia team
is willing to shell out $80 ,000 a
year for two years;

According to John Kolwalski,
Terlecki wants a salary higher than
the Major Indoor Soccer League
average. Kolwalski would not give
exact figures, but he did admit that
the figure was more than $60,000 a
year. ‘

Steve Zungul of the New York
Arrows, who, along with Terlecki,
was named co-Most Valuable
Player, is the leagues’; highest paid

player, earning about $150,000 a
year plus bonuses, yielding an
additional $50,000.

Despite all the bad news with
Terlecki, Kolwalski said that an
oral agreement was reached with a
Polish World Cup player whose
namehe wouldn’t reveal.

In other Spirit news, the Spirit
announced that a contract was
signed with KDKA television
(Channel 2) to televise at least eight
games during the 1982-83 season.

KDKA televised Spirit games dur-'

ing the first two years of the fran-
chise, while WPTT (Channel 22.)
handled the games last year.

Nationals win again...

ing games during the past two
years. Intentions for buying tickets
through the full or partial season
plan were rated high, and 70 per-
cent of the fans said they bought
their tickets at least one week in
advance.

The amount of action in the
game was listed as the major point
in drawing fans to the games. The
inconsistent play of the Penguins
was found to cause a decline in
attendance. Many suggested hav-

ing an overtime period to settle tie

games. Also, one out of four fans
said that a giveaway night moti-
vated them to attend a game.

Saturday and Wednesday were
the game days rated highest in pop-
ularity, with many requesting
more Friday night or Sunday after-
noon games. Many fans also
expressedia desire to move the start-
ing times of weeknight games to
7:00 p.m.

Some of the problems the fans
mentioned in the survey include
traffic, parking and the dirty condi-
tion of the Arena after events.
