The Pitt News regrets these errors.

Correctiomon March 26, The Pitt News reported that Pitt is the ﬁrst school in the Atlantic Coast Conference to join the Real Food Challenge. This information was
incorrect. Pitt has not yet signed the commitment because this requires administrative approval. According to Jessica McDonald, a senior majoring in environmental sci-
ence, Pitt could be the ﬁrst school in the ACC to sign the Real Food Challenge commitment. ”

The article also stated that Real Food Day was held last March by the members of the Real Food Challenge. This information is incorrect. Food Day was held last October
by the Fair Food Cooperative and Free the Planet. ‘

The article also stated that the cooperative has garnered about 12,000 signatures on its petition since it began tabling. This information is incorrect. The Cooperative

Student environmentalists  for more sustainable hydration

Abbey Reighard
Stcyj” Writer

The Student Government Board has in-
troduced another green initiative to its
smattering of environmentally friendly
policies this semester. '

Environmental Committee Chair-
woman Kacy McGill has been working
with Board member Mona Kazour and
students from Pitt’s chapter of Take Back
the Tap on the latest green initiative that
Kazour introduced to the Board at Tues-
day’s public meeting. A

Take Back the Tap is a national green
initiative that aims to reduce the number
of disposable plastic bottles in favor of
reusable water bottles.

The initiative belongs to the Food and
Water Watch, a national organization that
works to ensure that provisions of food
and water are healthy, sustainable and
accessible.

Seniors Sarah Boorboor and Melanie
Ordway have been working together as
co-presidents of Pitt’s Take Back the Tap,

. which they founded in fall 2012.

Boorboor, a political science and Eng-
lish writing major, said her sister previ-
ously worked for the GreenCorps — a
nonproﬁt organization thattrains envi-

ronmental activists —— and introduced,
Boorboor to the Food and Water Watch

and the Take Back the Tap initiative in
the fall of 2012.

Boorboor said representatives from
the Food and Water Watch presented her
with information about the impact of
unrecycled plastic water bottles on the
environment through web—based presen-
tations and information packets.

“The more I learned, the more pas-
sionate I became about the issue,” Boor-
boor said. i ,

According to the Food and Water
Watch’s oﬂicial website, only about 25
percent of plastic water bottles are re-
cycled in the‘United States. '

McGill said that she and other stu-
dents involved in the Take Back the Tap
initiative asked managers of on-campus
vendors who sell bottled water for weekly

totals of the number of bottles sold.

She added that she and the other
students calculated an average of about
9,000 plastic water bottles sold by on-
campus vendors per week. McGill also
said that that ﬁgure does not include
plastic water bottles sold from vending
machines on campus.

Boorboor then approached Ordway,
an environmental studies and business
major, to gauge her interest in spreading
the movement to Pitt.

“My initial thought was, ‘Why haven’t
we done this sooner?”’ Ordway said.

The two then-juniors began holding
meetings to discuss the initiative; A

“It started out as us and a few of our
friends,” said Ordway. “We were able to
gain more support by going to other clubs’
meetings and reaching out to people by
tabling in [Litchﬁeld] Towers lobby.”

The group now has about 10 regular -
members, according to Ordway. They’ve
also formed a coalition with other student
organizations dedicated to environmen-
tal initiatives: Free the Planet and Stu-

. dents for Sustainability.

The three environmental groups meet

every Wednesday to discuss green initia-

tives.
McGill said that during last February’s

‘ Blitz Week — a week when Take Back the

Tap, Free the Planet and Students for Sus-
tainability tried to collect as many signa-

. tures as they could on campus for a peti-

tion to ban the sale of bottled water — the
three student groups collected more than
1,000 signatures. “The movement isn’t to
necessarily stop the sale of water bottles,
but to" also make a statement,” Boorboor
said. “We don’t agree with what compa-
nies selling bottled water are doing and
we have the power to stop it.”. .

Take Back the Tap started at New York
University in 2008, according to Cam-
paign Director Dorothy Qian.

Qian, who is an intern with Food and
Water‘Watch, said she revived the cam-

‘paign at NYU after the students who

started the initiative at NYU graduated.

Wack wack city: Tyga a no show at spring hip-hop concert

Harrison Kaminsky
Assistant News Editor

Pitt students excited to attend a Pitt Pro-
gram Council—sponsored event featuring
hip-hop artist 'I‘yga were disappointed to
ﬁnd the headliner had canceled just before
the event began.

Pitt Program Council's adviser, Tom Mi-
suraca, was informed of the cancellation
while speaking with Tyga’s manager, Randall
Uritsky, over the phone at about 7 p.m. on
Friday night, when doors were set to open.

“He had ﬂight problems and was unable
to get to Pittsburgh,” Taylor Steffey, special
events director of PPC, said. ,

According to Steffey, a senior applied
developmental psychology major, PPC sold
roughly 1,800 tickets. After news of Tyga’s
cancellation broke, about 500 to 600 stu-
dents showed up for the event.

With Tyga cancelling, Pitt student and
winner of PPC’s Hip-Hop Battle event,_]aye
Hill, opened, followed by Chevy Woods,
a local Pittsburgh rapper often afﬁliated
with Wiz Khalifa and Taylor Gang Records,
whom PPC was able to book last minute. Ty
Dolla $ign, who was originally booked as the
opener, was designated to close the show.

Steffey said that PPC still has to work
out details on how they will be refunding

students, but she was able to conﬁrm that

PPC plans on refunding everyone as long as
they still have their ticket. She also said it is
likely that the refunds will be made available
at the William Pitt Union’s box ofﬁce.

“Currently, we plan on making refunds
available from April 8 to April 18,” she said.

Steffey said that PPC’s members were
disappointed after ﬁnding out that 'I‘yga
was not coming. .

“This event is something that we spend
months planning and an entire weekend

working on the actual event,” she said. “We

spent Thursday night building the stage and
all Saturday making sure everything was
set. It is a huge letdown to see something
you work so hard on not come to fruition.”

At this time, PPC has no plans to resched-
ule an event with Tyga.

“Due to time and budget constraints,
it is impossible to reschedule him this se-
mester,” Steffey said. “Additionally, the
[Fitzgerald] Field House is booked for the
rest of the semester.”

In order to avoid cancellations in the
ﬁiture, Steffey said there is only so much
that can be done. V

“We had no control over Tyga’s ﬂight. We
have stipulations in the contracts regarding
cancellations, and we take many steps to

“ ensure that this won’t happen, but many
. things are simply out of our hands,” she said.

but have high potential or others with
general STEM interests.

SEMFS works directly with the
schools’ coordinators to ﬁt their events
into the schools’ programming and host
the programs at Pitt as well as travel to
the schools to hold the events.

Howell said that the club’s events serve
to boost morale and build aspirations for
younger students.’

“A lot of the students we see have so
many voices in their lives telling them
that they can’t do things and won’t be
successful,” she said. “Our role as col-
lege students is to show them that they
aren’t so far behind us, and they can be
us some day.”

i Most of SEMFS’ members are science
or engineering majors, according to Zach
Barnes, vice president of the club.

One such student is Ryan Spano, a
freshman majoring in electrical engi-
neering, who got involved with the club
after meeting with some of the group

members during the fall activities fair at
the Petersen Events Center.

“I liked what it was about because I
like science and also working with kids,”

said Spano,‘ who also volunteered at the.

event. “It’s a really rewarding experience,
and the fact that even I’m learning new
things sometimes is incredible.”

Spano said he thought the event was
“extremely beneﬁcial” for the younger
students visiting Pitt.

“Here, they can learn things they
haven’t even learned at school yet,” Spano
said, adding that he gained something
from the experience, too. “I get an op-
portunity to make things and share them
with people. Where else can you do that?”
Spano said.

Because the younger students don’t
have a collegiate-level scientiﬁc un-
derstanding, Spano said SEMFS makes
the experiments kid—friendly through
hands-on activities, “so that they [could]
actually see and feel it and have a basic
understanding of the science behind it,
rather than just hearing about it in a class-
room setting.” _

grades, Spano said, it’s easier for them
to enjoy learning. This was true for a sixth
grader from Linton Middle School in Penn
Hills named Rylee who said that she came
because it was a voluntary class ﬁeld trip
and because she knew it was going to be
a lot of fun.

“I loved learning about different
sounds. We used bottles to see the dif-
ferent types of sound we couldjhear,” she
said, referring to her group’s experience
blowing on bottles containing differing
amounts of water.

Rylee also participated in an experi-
ment where students were required to
extract DNA from a banana, using materi-
als, including bananas, salt, baking soda,

detergent, rubbing alcohol, coffee ﬁlters,

clips, test tubes, forks, bowls and water.
The Pitt volunteers gave an “action
plan,” including step-by—step instruc-

' tions, to the students in smaller groups.

They also helped the students gain a
deeper understanding by pausing after
each step to explain the basic science
behind what was happening.

“It was pretty weird at ﬁrst, but it was
cool when we ﬁnished,” Rylee said.

During the experiment, one student
shouted, “We don’t even have to be in a
lab for this!”

Barnes also said the labless event has
helped the group partner with other insti-
tutions such as Tau Beta Pi, one of Pitt’s
honors engineering societies.

“We’ve been working with them for
quite a few weeks andplanning with
them,” he said. “They got completely
integrated into the mix.” '

Tenth grader Jason Beck of Ringgold
High School in Monongahela, Pa., attend-
ed the event because his sister Angela, a
Pitt junior and member of Tau Beta Pi,
was volunteering.

“I think this is so beneﬁcial for us,”
Beck said. “It always helps to work with
people who know more than you do. It’s
much easier to gain information from
others.” -

Beck said his favorite activity all day
was when Barnes demonstrated the Tesla
coil that he built with copper and wood
materials in his dorm room duringhis
freshman year.

dance lessons,jewelry and a host of other
cultural products, while 20 performanc-
es entertained attendees who ﬁltered
through Posvar Hall during the day.

Artist Jaime Roman sells small but I

colorful bug and animal sculptures made
from seeds fround all over the Americas
—— including Brazil, Peru, Mexico and
California —— and attended the festival
to share her work.

“This is the most fun,” artistJaime'Ro-
man said. “We deal with a lot of countries
all in one space.”

Roman’s family is as diverse as his
work. He’s originally from Puerto Rico,

and his wife Aisha — who stood beside '
. him all day helping sell his art —- is from

Mexico. _

What started as a hobby of 21 years is
now a business Roman calls Seedlings.
He sometimes visits up to 25 different
festivals in a year trying to sell his art,
and he said Pitt’s extravaganza is one of
his bigger events.

Because of its popularity, the Center
for Latin American Studies advertises the
festival for months before it happens.
Asenjo added that the timing, before ﬁ-
nals start, mixed with theipoor weather
on Saturday helped attract students to
the event.

Volunteers from the center help run
the event, handing out programs and

setting up booths. No one receives com-
pensation, according to Asenjo, aside
from the money the venders make on
their own. -

David Suzuki who just graduated from
the Oakland School in Pittsburgh was a
voluhteer at the event. '

“I’m excited to see the Capoeira,” Su-
zuki said. “It’s dancing, but it’s also a
kind of martial art.”

At the booth for Building New Hope,
a nonproﬁt based in Pittsburgh, Granada
and N iclaragua, Matt Yough volunteered
selling fair trade coffee, which is sold

, and marketed according to deﬁned stan-
\ dardsf

_ “Forty—three different families grow
the coffee,” Yough said. “We pay way
above the fair trade price.”

Cecilia Portugues sold alpaca fur dolls,

jewelry and flutes among other items

near the entrance to the festival. She gets
most of her inventory from abroad as
well, but her family provides her with
many of the supplies.

“I am from Cuzco,” Portugues said.
“Some of my family is still there, and

they send me [dolls].”

For Portugues, the festival is an op-
portunity to market her small business,
Paititi. But it’s also a chance to eat Peru-

vian food and meet people in the com-

munity. In the middle of sales, passersby
will stop and askabout her roots.

“I say, ‘Oh, where are you from?”’ she
said. “We don’t know each other, but we
are all meeting here.” I

“My favorite part was deﬁnitely work-
ing with electricity and magnetism,” Beck
said. “I’ve always had an interest in mag-
netism and electricity. I don’t know why,
it’s just such a fascinating topic.”

Barnes described the Tesla coil as “ba— _

sically a really big voltage transformer,
kind of like how power lines do it,” which
creates enough voltage at the top of the
coil allows bolts of electricity to shoot off.
Barnes ﬂicked the switch to turn on
the Tesla coil, and students immediately
jumped back in surprise at the loud elec-
trical noises emitted from the machine.
As students watched in awe, Barnes

used a ﬂuorescent light bulb as a rod to
showsthat the electricity was attracted to
the bulb, but wouldn’t conduct through it
so as to shock him. This allowed Barnes
to teach some of the basics of electricity,
including wiring, current and magnetic
induction to the high" schoolers.

Barnes got the inspiration to build the
coil from a previous member of SEMFS,
who showed him what he could do and
told him to “just go out and do it.”

“I realized it was more realistic than
I had originally thought,” Barnes said.

After the demonstration, one student

- cried out, “How did you build it?”

Barnes gave a-‘short and sweet expla-
nation. I

“Passion, love for children and duct
tape,” he said. I

TAP

Qian said the NYU chapter of Take
Back the Tap is a coalition of students,
faculty, alumni and community members
who are “striving to ban the sale of plastic
water bottles at New York University.”

“The Take Back the Tap campaign
at NYU is still going strong,” Qian said.
“Activists are continuing to collaborate
with administrators at NYU and Food and

Water Watch to design a public aware-
ness campaign and prepare to phase out

. bottled water from campus.”

Qian said regular Take Back the Tap
activities hosted by the group at NYU in-
clude tap water versus bottled water taste
tests, tabling across campus to inform
students about the impacts bottled wa-
ter has on’ the environment and reusable
water bottle drives where environmental
groups collect reusable water bottles for
students to use in place of plastic water
bottles.

Qian said the reusable bottle drives are
meant to help students “kick the bottled
water habit.”

Student Government Board President
Mike Nites said that before supporting an
initiative such as Take Back the Tap, the

Board must deliberate and conﬁrm the ‘

initiative’s feasibility and support among
the student body. ,

He said the Board ensures that the
initiative is feasible by evaluating the suc-
cess of similar programs at other schools.

“If [the program] is feasible at another

school, it’s probably feasible here, too,”
Nites said.

N ites also said the Board must have
evidence that the student body supports
the initiative and will likely hold an of-
ﬁcial vote on the initiative at the Board’s
public meeting this Tuesday.

“I think plasticwater bottles are very
ingrained into our thought process,” Ni-
tes said. “The Board needs to ask if [the
initiative] is something the student body
wants as opposed to just the groups push-
ing for it.” I

Bethel Habit-e
For the Pitt News

I have spent a great deal of time dur-
ing the past several months staring
sadly outside my window as light,
white ﬂakes fell with a vengeance
upon Pittsburgh. Yet,_no moment
was as tragic as those in which I was
forced from my room and dropped
into the midst of the haze to he-
roically blaze a path to class. The
wanting of a snow day can easily
drive a student to insanity, or, as
exhibited by the students of the
University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign, racism.

When students at Illinois were
informed that they would not re-
ceive a snow day on a particularly
frigid school day, they took to social
media to verbally attack Chancellor
Phyllis Wise for reasons that soon
escalated beyond her unpopular
decision and toward her Asian heri-

tage. Likening her to a variation of
North Korean dictator Kimjong-un
and insinuating a communist agen-
da, students propagated the newly
emerging hashtag, #f"‘ckphyllis.
Wise used the opportunity to
promote the necessity of the uni-
versity’s diversity efforts through
her chancelldr’s blog, stating that,
“Of all places, a university should
be home to diverse ideas and dif-
fering perspectives, where robust
—— and even intense —- debate and
disagreement are welcomed.”
A ‘Wise is not alone in her goals

- for diversity, as her statement is

synonymous with that of many dif-

ferentinstitutions,includingthatof I
' Pitt. Yet in aworld in which racism

and prejudice continue, how can
a university hope to achieve this
idealized state of diversity? Pitt,
like many schools across the na-
tion, battleswith this very ques-
tion of how to diversify on all lev-

of Pitt’s efforts, it appears that the
diversity on the college campus is
not hindered or enhanced by any
particular factor, but rather, by the

combined effects of the University’s A

efforts to address individual fac-
tors.

When asked aboutlPitt’s diver-
sity goals, Dean of Students Kathy
Humphrey said, “It is critical for
our campus to reﬂect diversity
so that we can all learn from one
another and be enriched by our
differences,” while also stating

the University’s role: “A University '

should be a place where diversity of
thought is respected and cherished
by everyone.”

, Despite the beliefs of the admin-
istration, these goals are not always
prevalent on the campus, and di-
versity statistics remain skewed
toward the white majority. Outside
of population statistics, what other

- factors could conﬂict with the di-

versity goals of the administration?

Social psychologist and Pitt pro-
fessor Martin Greenberg said, in re-
lation to diversity of viewpoints, the
intensity to which one holds certain
viewpoints may result in hostility,
especially once students verbalize
and argue their beliefs, thereby, be-
coming more committed to those
beliefs. These beliefs can range
from opinions on controversial
world issues to those resulting from

family backgrounds. Ifthese beliefs ,

are held strongly by an individual,
they have the potential to become
strengthened, rather than broad-
ened, through the interactions with
differing opinions when made part
of a classroom discussion.
Alternatively, sociologist and
Pitt professor Mike Epitropoulos
said auniversity is a reﬂection of the
larger, dominant society in which
it resides. Regardless of individual

Statistics a hindrance when promoting and maintaining diversity r  

' els. Though, based on the effects

university efforts, it cannot com-
pletely distance itself from prac-
tices of the dominant culture.

Social psychologistjohn Levine,
who teaches a course called Inner
Group Relations, points out that
attaining diversity on a university
level is dependent on how one de-
ﬁnes diversity.

In my opinion, diversity can
be deﬁned as differences in racial,
educational, sexual and other con-
ﬂicting backgrounds that can af-
fect a student’s thoughts, behaviors
and interactions, which result ﬁom
combining these differences.

Levine also emphasizes the ef-
fect of the classroom on diversity,
which depends on the setting of the
classroom itself, stating, “diversity
can be in the foreground or in the
background, depending on the edu-

cation goals ofthe classroom,” to describe
the degree of attention paid to the inﬂuence
of diversity within a classroom.

Also noting the limitations on the effects
of diversity within different classrooms, ju-
nior Grace Kim said, “In [general education
courses], I see different majors come -together
who have different goals, work ethics and
views, which gives you a wider View of how
people think,” while going on to point out
that “In large classes, diversity doesn’t have
as large as a role because you don’t really get
to interact with other people.”

How would Pitt go about minimizing or
eliminating these factors to promote its di-
Versity efforts‘? ’

Greenberg states, “To get the most out of
avdiverse population, you need both a diverse

' population and trained individuals” believ-

ing in the value of professors as classroom
facilitators for diversity.
Despite shortcomings in its attempts to

r maintain a diverse population, Pitt has pro-

grams to encourage its students to engage

with each other — such as those established
by the Office of Cross Cultural and Leadership
Development, alongwith the OCC curriculum
-— to allow students to learn about different
cultures. Additionally, Pitt has resources for
faculty to become better adept at facilitating
diverse settings, with programs including
the Faculty Diversity Seminar-and the Allies
Network, in which faculty pledge to increase
their awareness of LGBTQ issues, as well
as signaling their participation in) training
orientated toward developing sensitivity to
students’ differences. I

Taking a more radical approach, Epitr -
poulos claims that “the best education is not
tolerating discrimination” and believes in
utilizing infractions to prevent individuals
from having negative effects on others as
well as making it clear that the behavior is
intolerable.

, At Pitt, students can contact the Oﬂice
of Affirmative Action, Diversity and Inclu-
sion if they feel that they have been unfairly
treated, and the office resolves to investigate
and remedy any conﬂicts. A

Diversity of education is also taken into
consideration through programs such as the
Academic Resource Center, the Writing Cen-

ter and other educationally based initiatives
that promote diversity by helping diminish
any disadvantages that differences in a stu-
dent’s educational background might have on
his or her classwork. Regardless of whether
students take advantage of these resources,
they are informed of the value that Pitt places
on diversity through the Pitt Promise that
every new student recites at the convocation
held during orientation week.

It’s admirable to note the way the student
body at Pitt perceives the administration’s
diversity efforts. Freshman Nicole Berardi-
nelli said, “Compared to my high school, Pitt
is very diverse because my high school was
predominantly Caucasian.”

Additionally, junior Danielle Levsky said,
“Overthe past two years‘, Pitt has become alot
more diverse.” However, she also notes feel-
ing fazed her freshman year by a dominant
white majority, or 74 percent of the student
population.

While Pitt claims to utilize its best efforts
at maintaining a diverse population, whites
make up 72 percent of the student body, de-
creasing by about 1 percent each year as the
population sizes of minority groups increase
at about the same gradual pace.

r P     ries

 D7 Y5T£MS

However, regardless of the minimal
changes in statistical diversity over the years,
students and faculty still note a greater in-
crease in Pitt’s diversity. As a contrast, stu-
dents at Illinois exhibited racial insensitivity,
despite Asians occupying 14 percent of the
student body, proving that population de-

, mographics alone do not always accurately

portray how effective an administration is at
inciting diversity.

By intitiating a focus on the connections
between students of differing demographics,
attendance of faculty to student diversity and
minimizing hindrances to diversity, Pitt has
managed to obtain diversity in ways that it
is unable to generate through demographic
statistics alone. -

Yet, there is only so much that a univer-
sity can achieve in relation to diversity goals
when limited by population statistics. We can
only hope that prospective students currently
touring the campus perceive the potential
of Pitt’s diversity based on the interactions
found between current students of differing
backgrounds and choose to attend, if not for
the diversity found today, then for their abil-
ity to play a part in the diversity of the future.

Retaining
talent a key for
Pitt, Dixon

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staff Wrz'ter

In Jamie Dixon’s recent recruiting
classes, many signees didn’t meet the
esteemed standard that the Panthers’
coach has cultivated since taking on
Pitt’s head coaching position in 2003.

Dixon hasn’t retained a full class of
commits since 2004, and lately, that
trend has spun out of control.

Six of Dixon’s 11 commits from the
2009-2011 recruiting classes had a dif-
ficult time adapting to Dixon’s on-court
system, and they parted ways with the
program" in the early years of their ca-
reers. Additionally, Trey Zeigler, who
came to‘, Pitt in 2012, transferred to
Texas Christian‘ University last spring,

and Steven Adams, Pitt’s most highly‘

touted recruit in decades, was selected
12th in last year’s NBA Draft.

Now, Dixon appears to have his best
to-be—sophomore class in years, and
in the coming weeks, he must work to
retain it, as well as his elder players..

His current freshmen —- Michael
Young,]amel Artis andjosh Newkirk —
along with transfersjoseph Uchebo and
Derrick Randall — have proven to fit the
Pitt mold, a rare trait among members
of Pitt freshmen since 2009.

Newkirk had an outstanding fresh-
man campaign, averaging eight points
per game in Pitt’s ﬁnal eight games.
Artis has drawn comparisons to for-
mer three-year starter and ultimate go-
getter Nasir Robinson. Young, a starter
who averaged six points and four re-
bounds per contest, could’ve made more

of a late-season impact had he not been

plagued a lower-back injury.

_The Pitt baseball team continued its

Washington and Blakely pushed their
highly ranked opponents to a tiebreaker,
but lost 7-5 in extra play as Kay and Price
took a 8-7 victory. Washington earned re-

in straight sets 6-4, 6-3.

Washington said a key factor behind
her victory was the mentality she carried
into the match, and she said she tried not
to think about her opponent’s ranking, but
instead, her own game.

“I tried to focus on myself and not on
her, and I really think that helped me pro-
pel myself to get the win,” Washington said.

Her head coach, Alex Santos, was also
pleased with the way Washington com-
posed herself on the court.

ing “Never been told not to shoot the
ball til I got here [shaking my head],”
and he certainly wouldn’t smile if he
were asked to play a position that limits
outside jumpers even more.

Moreover, it’s hard to imagine that
any college player would choose to sit
in favor of another member of his class,
especially when Artis’ talent level‘ is
accounted for.

While Newkirk played a lot at the
wing this past season, he is a natural
point guard. It’s all but set in stone that
James Robinson will claim the starting
point guard role again as a junior next
season, and Newkirk may not want to
give away three full seasons to sit be-
hind Robinson.

Newkirk, a native of Raleigh, N.C.,
gained notoriety throughout ACC play,
and if he desires to start immediately,
he may look to play somewhere closer
to home.

Chris Jones, who will be a redshirt

sophomore in the fall, is another player
Dixon cannot afford to lose.

Jones missed many practices this
season because of an injury suffered to
his shooting hand before the season,
and as a result, Pitt fans were unable
to see his true value. _

Beforejones sustained his injury, his
scoring capabilities were on display at
the Pittsburgh Basketball Club Pro-Am
last summer, as he scored almost 16
points per game.Jones was guarded by
Pitt teammates, as well as guards from
West Virginia, Robert Morris, Duquesne
and other schools. ‘

- Dixon said that Jones will likely get
surgery on his hand in the offseason,
and barring.an interrupted recovery,
Jones could blossom into a Lamar Pat-
terson replacement in the near future.
In fact, he’s my breakout candidate for
2014-2015. '

To add to the task at hand, Dixon and
his staff have expressed recent interest
in adding yet another player to the list
of his 2014 signees.

This is a head—scratcher because
the staff will likely meet its 13-scho1ar-

After all, Mostella’s Twitter bio still
reads: “Committed to Pitt.”

But considering the projected paths
of Pitt’s young players, it makes little

her victory against Mar in three sets by a
1-6, 6-4, 10-7 tally. Assistant coach Emily
Fraser said the freshman became more

run in the ﬁfth, and seventh innings, but
struck out four batters and needed 100
pitches to get through his seven frames
of work. Wotherspoon said his fastball
locationwas one of the keys to his success
on themound after struggling with that
aspect in the last few weeks.

“I kind of got back to working off my
fastball today,‘”l,Wotherspoon said. “Just
gettingahead of guys then being able to
throw the off—speed while I’m ahead made
it easy to put guys away.”

Behind the senior from Mountain Top, l

Pa. the Panthers handed Matthew Grimes
his first loss of the season. Pitt got out to

aggressive on the court and adjusted in
the second set to overcome a slow start.

“There was a point there, towards the
end of the second set, where she found a
different kind of intensity and really placed
a high priority on being aggressive and
looking to take her ﬁrst opportunity,” Fra-
ser said. “I think that ultimately led her to
be able to win that match.”

Not only did her mentality change, but
Ogungbesan said she also adjusted her
emotions to elevate her level of play.

"‘I started of really slowly,” Ogungbe-

18

san said. “In the second set, I was down
as well, and my emotions were all over
the place, but Emily was trying to help me
stay calm and remind me that I should be
like, more aggressive in the points and
things like that.”

But Ogungbesan was the only trium-
phant Panther, as each other Pitt player
lost. Washington took the/ﬁrst set of her
match with Chalena Scholl, 6-2, but lost
her lead as Scholl responded with emphatic
6-2, 6-1 wins in the ﬁnal two sets of the
match. I

a 2-0 lead in the third and chased Grimes ,   is i:

from the mound with another run in the
ﬁfth inning.

Wotherspoon’s performance was one
Jordano said he was “really pleased with”
and one that both the pitcher and the team
needed.

“He commanded his pitches well,”‘_Ior-
dano said. “He gave us an opportunity, just
asjoe and Rhys did the previous two days.”

Wolsonovich put the Panthers up in

V the third when he singled to right on a 3-1

offering, scoring Pazos andjohnson from

second and third, respectively. Georgia V I

‘Tech responded with one run in the ﬁfth
on a RBI'single from Daniel Spingola, but
Wotherspoon escaped any more trouble
by inducing a ﬂyout.

Pitt answered by scratching out a run
in both the ﬁfth and sixth innings to open
up a three—run lead that the Yellowjackets
could not overcome. Luke Curtis entered
in relief of Wotherspoon and allowed a
pair of hits but no damage to cap off the
sweep. if .
