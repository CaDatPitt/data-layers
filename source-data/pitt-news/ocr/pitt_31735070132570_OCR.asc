Parade marchers focus on health care

‘MICHELLE Scorr
Senior Staff Writer

Monday’s downpour was a trickle in comparison
to the great river of union workers, classic cars, con-
struction vehicles and marching bands in Pittsburgh’s
annual Labor Day parade, one of the!’ largest Labor
Day parades in the United‘ States.

Steel workers, postal workers,
municipal employees, painters,
machinists and unions representing a
smorgasbord of other occupations
marched from Mellon Arena to the
Pittsburgh Hilton and Towers. As they
escorted giant light-bulb ﬂoats, PAT-
buses and even a tiny log cabin down
Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh’s workers
were cheered on by passers—by and by
Parade Grand Marshall and County
Controller Dan Onorato. The
Allegheny County Labor Council, a
branch of the American Federation of
Labor and the Congress of Industrial
Organizations — commonly known as
the AFL-CIO —— sponsored the parade.

“This is one of the oldest and most
successful parades in the country,” said

electricians,

County Democratic ’ Party. He
described Pittsburgh as a “bastion of
unionism,” and added that there have
been Labor Day parades in Pittsburgh
for about 100 years, and that the parade
usually features between 120 and 130

union units. -

Despite the wide variety of occupations held by
laborers and supporters at the parade, they were all
united by this year’s theme, “Save Our Healthcare.”

“I thought it was an excellent point for the Labor
Day parade,” state Rep. Don Walko, D—North Side,
said. He explained that the rising cost of health care is
not just a problem for large companies employing
union workers, but also for small companies who must

Rockwell said in a song, “I always feel
like somebody’s watching me.” And, if you’re
an international student, it’s true — somebody is
always watching.

in Iraq, it can put more money toward health care.

“We have not been meeting the challenge,” he
added.

“Health care’s a bigeone; it’s big with everybody,”
said Ray Kaiser, a steel engraver with the International
Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers.
“Health care and job security.”

Joe Meyers, a member of the Greater
Pennsylvania - Carpenters Union,
explained that laborers have health care
coverage under the union unless they are
laid off for a long period of time. Meyers
added “I’ve been pretty fortunate to work
for a company for three and a half years.
There’s a lot of guys sitting.right now.”

Tom Hoffman, a spokesman for the
Service Employees International Union
—'which includes the Pitt’s janitors and
grounds crew — said that, while Pitt
workers have gotten the best contract
they’ve had in years, the health care issue
they face is far from solved, since their
wage increases and their" contract with

L UMPC will only cushion the workers for
about a year. At least one Pitt worker
marched along with SEIU’s Justice for

healthc-are workers and state employees,
and several members of Pitt’s Students in
Solidarity.‘

Hoffman added that ‘the issues Pitt

Be

Doctors learn how to talk

with their dying patients  

DIANNA FORISKO
Staff Writer

Imaginethat you are terminally
ill. You suffer from constant pain
and the knowledge that you only
have a few weeks left to live.

Now imagine that the only care
you receive comes from a person

who’ communicates better with a.

stethoscope and needle than with
her mouth or eyes.
For many terminally ill patients

‘receiving care only from a physi-

cian, this scenario is reality.

Pitt is trying to help relieve the
problem faced by doctors who have,
trouble communicating with seri-
ously or terminally ill patients, who
often require as much mental and
emotional care as
physical attention.

Pitt has teamed
up with Family

micians and health
care professionals
working to enrich
end—of—life care for
patients who are
seriously ill or suf-
fering from termi-
nal diseases.

The collabora-
tion unites researchers and doctors
with a group of hospice. healthcare
professionals active in’ palliative
care, teaching _doctors to improve
their communication and to help
them better understand their
patients’ needs. m '

“A lot of doctors are so focused

on curative medicines that they-

don’t communicate with the patient
about their needs and fears,” said

« David Barnard, institute director
. and director of palliative care edu-

cation at Pitt’s Center for Bioethics
and Health Law. “By working
closely with hospice—based people
in the community, we hope to help
professionals communicate along
those lines.”

Palliative care targets patients
who have 1ife—1imiting diseases
with a combination of curative
medicines ——- giving the patient the
best form of physical treatment
available — and comfort —- com-
municating and discussing patients’
concerns and anxieties. The com-
municative therapy helps patients
and their families.’

“Palliative care
focuses on the

care for the
whole person.”

p Raphael Sciullo
Institute co-director and president of tal-
Family Hospice and Palliative Care

Raphael Sciullo,‘ institute co-
director and president of Family
Hospice and Palliative Care,
described palliative care as an
approach that takes all aspects of
patients’ needs into consideration.

“Palliative care focuses on the
whole person and providing care
for the whole person,” he said.
“This approach focuses not only on
physical pain management, but also
patients’ emotional, social, and
spiritual needs. We’re trying to cre-
ate an institute where We’re looking
at all elements and creating a train-
ing modality for professionals to
understand more what patients are
experiencing.” '' I -

more effective manner.

"‘There are rnany.’-people out

said. ‘,‘We believe that it is very
much due to lack" of education, and
by providing that education we feel
we can help more people access the
palliative care they need.”

- The institute hopes to increase

.. the number of health care providers

and spread the word to patients and
families about the availability of
quality palliative care. It willlalso
provide comfort and support , for
patients and their families through
the course of the illness and after-

workers handled in their contract,
including health care, will resurface
when the contract for the SEIU Justice
for Janitor’s group Downtown expires
on October 31.

“Now, less than ﬁve percent of jan-
itors choose family health care because

they can’t afford the co—pay,” he said. ,

He added that a janitors’ strike in mid-
November is “a deﬁnite possibility”

should renegotiations be unsuccessful. '

Though the union workers used the
parade as a forum for presenting union
issues, the parade also served to build

up union morale and have some good,
clean — albeit soggy —fun. Marching
bands from high schools in the
Pittsburgh area played on cheerfully
through the ‘downpour, clowns and
Marx Brothers impersonators mingled
with passers-by along Fifth Avenue, and
little kids chased each other through the
crowd and handed out candy, pencils,
and ﬂiers. Whole families marched in
the parade, including dogs wearing
multicolored union T-shirts.

“It’s very much a family affair,”.

Hoffman said. “One of the key compo~
nents of our campaign Downtown is
reaching out to the community.”

Institute will focus on end-of-life care

- Doctors, page 4

Care will also work with the
University’s School of Medicine,
focusing on the research component
of palliative care. The collaboration
will enable the professionals to
venture out of the university setting
and base their research on commu-
nity needs. The institute will also
focus on building support from
community groups and policy—mak—

ers to generate better decisions
regarding end-of-life care.

The University’s School of
Medicine will house the institute in
its palliative care and medical
ethics section, where a group of
health care professionals have been
studying and researching palliative
care, as well as training care
providers and assisting patients in
several hospitals within the .UPMC

Patriotism in schools shouldn’t be legislated

United States District Judge Robert
F. Kelly signed an order last month
overruling an act passed in
Pennsylvania in December that required
all students and teachers in the state to
stand and recite the Pledge of
Allegiance or to sing the national
anthem every moming. Under the act,
any student who refused faced suspen-
sion, a letter home or both.

Requiring students to say the Pledge

. or sing the anthem runs contrary to the

principles that both represent in the first
place. T e United States was founded
on the notions of free speech and the
right to disagree and dissent. A funda-
mental aspect of free speech is the right
to not speak ——- to not participate in the
rituals that deﬁne patriotism. Any mea-
sure that runs counter to free speech
runs counter to patriotism-— if patrio-
tism is deﬁned as love of the principles
this country was founded on, the princi-
ples that set it apart and make it great.

Enforcing a rule thatrequires a mid-
dle- or high-school student —— the most
sleep-deprived and surly species on the
planet — to stand and recite a pledge or
sing a difficult song first thing in the
morning is ridiculous.

The kid in question could be
abstaining for any number of apolitical
reasons. Perhaps her thoughts are else-
where. Maybe his voice is breaking and
trying to hit the high notes of the anthem
— in public — is the worst form of pub-

__for_Ame.rica’s image, abroad. _

lic humiliation imaginable. .-

There are legitimately political rea-
sons, too, that don’t have anything to 
with being a junior member of a terror-
ist network. The national anthem is ._a
bellicose song, glorifying “the rockets’
red glare,” and “the bombs bursting 
air.” A patriotic paciﬁst could certainly
object to these lyrics. V;

What about exchange students?
Should we expect a visitor from Japan
to stand and pledge allegiance to a coun-
try in which she is’ merely a guest? That
hardly seems fair, and suspending suclj
a student certainly won’t do any good

Teachers’ have enough to " worry
about. Many local districts are on the
verge of labor strikes and walkouts,
funding is perilously tight, and the
threat of violence is ever-present; With
so much to worry about —— and we
haven’t' even begun wondering if

Johrmy can read — it’s too much to ask.

of our teachers to police the utterances
of every kid, every morning. Sending
letters home isn’t free — taxpayers have
to pay for the postage —— and suspension
breeds resentment in students. 1

Judge Kelly is to be highly com-
mended for standing against a rising tide
of nationalism in schools. Of all the
issues facing schools today, this trivial
attempt to legislate patriotism upon stu-
dents should be the last that any teacher
needs to address.

arely con-sidring corporeal redecoration

I cannot resist a blank canvas. Bare“

rooms make me ﬁdget. There is nothing so

‘boring as the simplicity of a line, an unem-

bellished black dress or a monochromatic
painting. So, at age 11, when I looked at the
relative blankness of my skin, stretched
before me like so much ‘canvas, I thought
what Martha Stewart assessing a bathroom
or the Visigoths storming Rome must have
thought: it’s time to redeco-
rate. ‘

And then came the
piercings — beginning in a
doctor’s office and ending
in an impulse buy at a
Claire’s — four in the left
ear, six in the right and one,
a 16-gauge in my left nos- .

modification is frowned on. -

I’ve already violated Jewish law by get- A

ting my earspierced. “Ye shall not make any
cuttings in your ﬂesh . . . nor print any marks
upon you (Leviticus 19:28).” I’m pretty sure
a 16-gauge nose-ring counts as a cutting in
my ﬂesh. Why, then, not go whole hog about
tattoos? Half a sin is worse than none. But
piercing is reversible, and, despite all
Angelina Jolie’s claims about her
“Billy Bob” tats, tattooing isn’t.

‘a Before I‘ continue, I just
want to say that I’m not hesitating
because of other reasons. I’m not
afraid of stretching —_ my shoul-
der blades remain unaﬂ’ected by
wei t ﬂuctuations. Nor am I

I want a tattoo,‘and not .
some cutesy heart or butterﬂy. I want words

.and symbols and everything that I stand for,

orhopeto standfor, inkedintomy skin.

And, as an adult, I have every legal right
to get as many as I want. I don’t, ﬂrough.
What is standing in my way? Religion No,
stop laughing at the little atheist who could-
n’t. I rejected most forms of organized reli-
gion — though my dad scoffs at this and
claims that Judaism was neva organized -
when I was around 11, around the time I
began my corporeal overhaul.

But some things linger. I use guilt as a
projectile, cook a mean matzo ball and iden-
tify myself as culturally Jewish. I wouldn’t
shave my head, out of respect for those who
suffered in the camps, and wouldn’t get any
tattoo related to numbers. These are parts of
history I don’t want written on me.

So it boils down to one issue — people
with tattoos cannot be buried in most Jewish
cemeteries. The “dust-to—dust’ ’ thing is taken
quite seriously. As you came, so sliall you
return. Resultantly, some Jews won’t
become organ donors,‘ and, in general, body

meaning an artist, activist, agita-

tor,aprankster,aguarderofthe~sacred'

secrets, and the other “with the urgency of-
love,” that is, force, desireand sexual ener-
gy. I saw them in Michael Ondaatje’s book,

“Anil’_s Ghost,” and lmew that’s what I «

wanted.

Why do I cling to the restrictions of a
religion I renounced? Maybe it’s because,
unlike the pope, I acknowledge my fa]]ibili-
ty. No offense to John Paul II, but I don’t
want to preclude the possibility that I’m.
wrong. If Judaism got rid of all that pesky
ritual, deleted that Levitican atavism “If a
manalsoliewithmankind,asheliethwitha
woman, both of them have committed an
abomination” -and renounced its faith in,
well, faith, I’d join up. Maybe. _

.At 19, am I ready to etch my lack of
religious ﬁrture into my skin? Nope.

For now, the only mark printed on me
will remain that cool Crayola marker tattoo
my friend put on my, er, convictions.

We want to wait until marriage, but we aren’t monks

Dear Sex N’ at:

My girlfriend and I have been together for almost
two years now and both want to remain abstinent until
marriage; even if we do end up with each other. We’ve
had quite a bit of fun with oral and hand-
jobs, but frankly, it starts to get a little old.
What kind of things would you recom-
mend for us to keep up the excitement and
pleasure?

-Homy and Abstinent
Dear Horny:

Boy, it seems only horny folks are
sending in questions these days. I wonder
if I’ll ever get a question from “Satiated
and Swell.” Oh, wait, what the hell would someone
like that need me for?

Two years of abstinence, eh? I think, in the truest
sense of the word, yinz aren’t quite abstinent; you two
are having a wonderful, intercourse-free sex life —
which is great. It’s highly unlikely that anyone’s going
to get knocked up until they want to, and waiting until
marriage to introduce even the possibility of baby-
ness is very noble. .

That said, you do know you aren’t entirely out of
the woods in terms of STD transmission, right? It’s
possible to transmit oral gonorrhea, strep, and some
varieties of herpes through unprotected oral sex. If
you have any doubts, get tested, and use dental dams
until the results come back. , . _

Okay, all public service announcements aside,
let’s get down to the business of spicing up your sex

 

 

Melissa Meinzer
Opinions, Editor

life  yum.

Girlfriend girl is making out like a bandit — your
oral or manual stimulation of her body is probably far
more clitorally oriented than intercourse would be, so
she’s probably having great orgasms constantly.
Vaginal sex creates different sensations
from clitoral stimulation. ,

Let’s say vaginal orgasms, those sel-
dom—seen, semi—mythological creatures,
are acoustic rock. Clitoral orgasms are
crank-it—up-to-eleven, hard rockin’,
Headbanger’s Ball explosions. You’ve
seen them, I presume? She probably loses
control of herself, however brieﬂy, and has
a slightly drugged feeling afterward —
like she’s stoned on her own sex chemi-
cals.

Guess what? If you give her a
moment to collect herself, she can go on and on and
on. So here’s' a quick, easy spicer-upper: see how
many times you can make her orgasm at one time. Lay
some bets on it. Get creative in your wagers. I don’t
need to tell you what to put on the line.‘

Since you’ve been together so long and respect
one another enough to keep to your abstinence deci-
sion, you are prime candidates for exploring the fine
arts of bondage and discipline, as well as role—playing.

These slightly darker sides of sexuality require a
great degree of trust. You can plumb each other’s hid-
den desires without fear of embarrassing yourselves,
and you can do so with a minimum of psychological
damage. A

The most important things are to establish con-
crete boundaries beforehand, and to agree on a “safe
word.” For instance, maybe she thinks she’d like you

to chase her around and pull up her skirt. In this case,
yelling, “Stop, stop it, oh stop, you brute!” may be part
of the fantasy. But what if she really wants you to
stop? If you’ve agreed before things get hectic, she
can murmur “luteﬁsk” and you’ll know all systems
are not go, and you can stop before she gets truly
upset.

Do you share your fantasies with her? Maybe
you’ve always gotten off on the idea of surrendering
complete control to her — or your high school English
teacher, or the mail carrier, or anyone else. Why not do
it? Let her tie your hands behind your back, blindfold
you, and have her way with you. All you need is a cou-

ple of neckties and some imagination. While visual

stimulation is a huge part of sexuality, being deprived
of it from timeto time is so unusual that it’s a kick —
and you can imagine the stimulation as coming from
anyone your heart — or any other part — desires.

VV1th a little imagination, you two can be anyone’

you want. Be a detective “interrogating” her. Be her
slave, taking her every command. If you both agree on
it, nothing is too freaky;

Take some time to.’ discover ‘your hidden desires.
Rent a couple poms and ﬁgure out what turns you on
the most. I’d recommend “Miscreants” or “Taboo 2”
—— or check out some specialty titles. There are a lot of
oral-only ﬁlms out there — consider it a sexy research
project.

And, for the love of Pete, get yourselves a good
dildo or ﬁve.

Ladies, don ’t be shy! Melissa Meinzer; despite not
being a medical or psychological professional, knows
you have some questions, too. Send her one at
sex@pittnews.com.

Dear Editor:

I am writing this in response to
the RIAA suing college students
for sharing copyrighted music
files.

I believe that this action-—
along with the law that permits it
— is contrary to the purpose of
copyright law, and that it is time to
consider changes to the current
copyright legislation so that non-
commercial file-sharing is consid-
ered to be fair use.

A copyright is not a natural or
inherent right; it is an artificial
right granted by Congress.

The purpose of copyrights is

not to benefit the copyright holder;
this is only a means to an end.

The true purpose, according to
the U.S. Constitution, is to “pro-
mote the Progress of Science and
useful Arts” — that is, to provide a
public benefit by encouraging the
production of creative works.

This has been affirmed by the
Supreme Court in Fox Film Corp.
V. Doyal (1932): “The sole interest
of the United States and the prima-

ry object in conferring the monop- 3

oly lie in the general benefits
derived by the public from the
labors of authors.”

An estimated 60 _million
Americans use file-sharing, peer-

to-peer systems. A
If the current copyright laws

restrict the use of such systems A

despite the wishes of the general
population, then these laws create
a public menace rather than a pub-
lic benefit. '

A solution to "this problem
would be to change the laws to
explicitly allow the noncommer-
cial sharing of copyrighted music

files. Artists could rely on the sale .

of concert tickets, royalties from
commercial radio stations, and
voluntary donations for support.
For a voluntary-donation sys-
tem to work, it would have to be
very convenient — perhaps a

“donate” button directly’ on com-
puter audio players or peer-to-peer
software — and allow micropay-
ments: donations as smallas one

cent, paid directly to the artists.

This letter is not intended to
encourage illegal copyright
infringement. ’

Rather, if you feelthat the laws

are unfair, it would be far more '

constructive to let your representa-
tives in Congress know about it.

Un-powerful yoga

MTV Power Yoga
Paramount Home
Entertainment/MTV Home
Entertainment

2“: 1/2

Yoga and Pilates are all the rage,
lately. Sting and Madonna have these
serene workouts to thank for their tight,
toned bodies.

And, if you have to have Madonna’s
body to kiss Britney Spears, sign me up.

“MTV Power Yoga,” the follow up
to last year’s “MTV Yoga,” hosted by
Lori from “The Real World: Back to
New York,” strives to mix in a bit of car-
dio with the poses.

Oh, how it fails.

“MTV Power Yoga” is hosted by
Kristin McGee, a certiﬁed yoga instruc-
tor. She launches right into the workout
without a rundown of poses. If you want
that, you have to purchase the DVD, as
it is one of the “bonuses.” Come on,
now, most beginning yoga students
have no idea what “warrior one,”
“downward-facing dog” and “lower
chaterunga” are.

\V1th all the concentration it takes to
ﬁgure out how to get into and out of the
positions, the workout is awkward at
first. However, there’s a lot of repeti-
tion, so, as you get further into the 48-
minute workout, things start to ﬂow bet-
ter.

And that’s another thing — the
workout is 48 minutes long. In that 48
minutes, the only sweat I broke came

' McGee points that out.

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

from my apartment’s lack of air condi-
tioning.

The calmness that comes from most
yoga instructors is just tiring — though
it is part of the inner—peace thing. The
background music isn’t calm and mel-
low, like on most yoga videos. This is
MTV. Up—and—coming pop—techno
group Blue Six provides the background
beats here. McGee’s voice is energetic,
though, which is a plus.

There are three others doing the
workout with McGee at beginning,
intermediate and advanced levels. You
are instructed to follow the person with
whom your level of experience" most
closely matches. For the most part, all
four are doing the same poses, and,
when there is room for variation,

After 48 minutes of power yoga,
there is a ﬁve—minute Pilates workout to
tone and tighten abs. VV1th power yoga,
48 minutes was too long, and, with
Pilates, ﬁve minutes isn’t enough.

Having just gotten back into hitting
the gym regularly, I expected to be pret-
ty sore the day after trying a different
workout for the. first time, but I wasn’t. a
That tells me that my time was wasted.
I struggle to move the day after a 20-
minute Pilates workout with Denise
Austin each time I get the urge to
lengthen my body. '

Perhaps the power-yoga didn’t seem
to do its job because I wasn’t doing the
exercises correctly. Or maybe it’s just
not as effective as it needs to be.

A little lesson in the art of reviewing pop culture

A few months ago, I had a little tiff with my A
boyfriend. He had read a review for a
movie and didn’t like what the author had
said about it. He griped that people
reviewing movies should stick to
telling readers what the movie is
about and keep their opinions out of it.
Oh, Mark.

I quickly explained to him that the
purpose of reviews —— ﬁlm, music, liter-
ary and others — is to help people to
decide whether said product is worth their
time and money. And, in order to do that,
such reviews frequently must present an »
opinion. ’

Of course, this column isn’t dedicated to
everyone reading it. There are people out
there who know why reviews are written —
people who may disagree, but who know the writer
is just doing his job. And now, I’ll ﬁll you in on the
art and purpose of reviews. '

i This column was further inspired by feedback
posted online in responseto a Rooney CD review
published this summer. I enjoyed the piece, but it
seems that some die—hard Rooney fans were upset.
Some went so far as to criticize the author’s writing.
One person posted, “Even if you don’t like Rooney,

F-Zero GX

Amusement Vision
i‘rﬁ'i‘r

Ten years ago,’ a Nintendo/Sega,

collaboration would have been
unimaginable, because they were
fierce rivals competing in a growing
video-game market. Today, the merger
is a success. ,

‘‘F-Zero GX” for the Nintendo
GameCube is the latest installment in
the “F-Zero” racing series. This ‘highly
anticipated title was developed by
Sega’s Amusement Vision team and
published by Nintendo. “F1-Zero GX”
is the best game released for
GameCube so far this year and proba-
bly the best racer on any system

, released this year.

The game’s top-notch graphics

- have the most immediate impact on the

player. It features more than a dozen
immense and beautiful tracks and 30
stylized vehicles to choose from. The
lighting and texture effects are equally
stunning. What is most impressive is
that all of these features are maintained
at 60 frames per second while riding at
speeds of over 2,000 kph with 29 other
vehicles moving on a track. .

It also features the option of run-
ning in widescreen or progressive-scan
mode. All of these features combine to
make “F-Zero G ” an amazing game
to look at in motion. The only draw-
back is the relatively low polygon

count of the individual vehicles, which

is barely noticeable.

Nintendo and Amusement Vision
spared no expense in the sound depart-
ment. Though the game only runs in
stereo sound, it-features a surprisingly
clean techno and rock soundtrack. The
sound effects are clear and the vocal
commentary chimes in often, though it

' does so without becoming annoying.

’ The play control is very intuitive
and has a steep learning curve. Each
vehicle controls beautifully with the
use of the analog sticks and triggers.
It’s a good thing too, as the tracks dip
and turn, often leaving little room for
error racing at high speeds.

Although the graphics, sounds and
play control are top-notch, “F-Zero
GX” is one of the most difficult racers
released in quite some time. The high
difficulty level may initially turn some
weaker gamers away, but those who
decide to stick with it will be rewarded.
The natural feel of the control scheme
and high difficulty level make “F-Zero
GX” a game that can be appreciated by
novices, but is still deep enough to sat-
isfy more seasoned gamers. “F—Zero
GX” is a must—buy.

Men’s socer pitcs shutout versus B

JEFF PARKER STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Pitt’s Keeyan Young battles defenders for the ball during the Panthers 1-0 vic-
tory over No. 13 Boston College. Young’s goal was the lone score of the game.

JIMMY JOHNSON
For The Pitt News

Defense was the deciding factor in
Pitt’s 1-0 victory over the defending
Big East champion Boston College
Eagles on Saturday.

The No. 13-ranked Eagles (0-1
Overall, 0-1 Big East) outshot Pitt 17-
9, with 11 of those shots being ﬁred in
the second half. Pitt’s defense’-and
sophomore goaltender Justin Lowery,
who made his first collegiate start,
stopped the onslaught of shots.

Lowery made ﬁve critical saves to
keep the potent Boston College offense
off the board.

Pitt (1-0,1-0) kept the ball in
Boston Col1ege’s half of the ﬁeld for
the majority of the ﬁrst half. The con-
stant pressure led to Keeyan Young’s
ﬁrst goal of the season at the 33:37
mark ’ in the first half, which would
prove to be the winning goal.

Young set up the play when he

stole the ball from an Eagles defender ..

and passed it to teammate Brendon
Smith, who then passed it to Johnathan
Clow. Clow shot the ball, and Boston
College goaltender Mike Cardenas
made the save, but deﬂected the shot
out to Young, who did not hesitate to

place the ball in the back of the net.

Boston College came out in the
second half showing why it was ranked
No. 13. Pitt spent the majority of the
second half warding off shots from the
Eagles.

Freshman Brian Madden made
several plays on defense, which kept
the Panthers’ shutout intact.

“I thought we ran out of gas a bit in
the second half,” coach Joe Luxbacher
said. “But we dug in and hung in
[there] for dear life. A win is a win.”

When the game entered the ﬁnal
minute, Pitt was able to ease the pres-
sure and move the ball downﬁeld,
where it would remain until. the clock
hit zero.

“We had the mentality coming in
that we were going to win,” Young
said. “You have to have that mentali-

The Panthers started four freshman
and three sophomores in the game. The
team has 14 freshmen overall, but that
does not worry Coach Luxbacher at all.

“The core of the team is back from
last season,” Luxbacher said.

Pitt will be participating in the
Mayor’s Cup next weekend. It will
face Hartwick Sept. 6 at noon and
Oneonta Sept. 7 at 2:30 p.m.

In Defenseof Pirates GM Dave Littlefield

Recently, there’s been a

. lot of anger directed at vari-

ous facets of Pittsburgh
sports. Steelers coach Bill
Cowher, I hear, is insane for
making Jerome Bettis a back-
up. Pitt fans feel betrayed by
our very own Rod
Rutherford, who is accused of

5 doing some very bad things.

And the city’s current budget
crisis, according to angry cit-
izens, is entirely the fault of
the new stadiums on the
North Shore. Ah, if only our
fair president had such a
beautiful, gleaming, obvious
scapegoat for the rest of the
country. 5 -

But there has been no tar-
get so openly and angrily
attacked as Dave Littleﬁeld,
general manager of the
Pittsburgh Pirates.

In the past month or so,

Littleﬁeld and the rest of the

Pirates front ofﬁce have been
hastily shopping players to
other teams, trying desperate-

‘ly to dig the Bucs out of the

financial and talent-less
hole dug by Cam Bonifay.
Sunday night’s postsea-
son roster deadline marked
the official end to a ﬂurry
of moves that angered tons
of Pittsburghers, who have
dubbed the past month a
“salary dump” and a “fire
sale.” Some of the most tar-

geted deals were ones that '

sent elsewhere players like
Aramis Ramirez, Mike
Williams, Jeff Suppan and
Brian Giles. _

But. seriously, people,
give the man a break. He’s
doing his job, even though
we’re not used to that.

Let’s ﬁrst take care of the
semantics: the deals consti-
tute neither a ﬁre sale nor a

Giles is admittedly one of
the best hitters in the game.
He also made $8.5 million
this year, and is due to make
more in the two remaining
years of his contract. There is
no way we could have kept
him, in our ﬁnancial position,
after 2005, so we got some-
thing for him while we could.

Volleyball finishes second

in weekend tournament

RAYMOND NEWBY
For The Pitt News

The Pitt volleyball team began its
season with a victory against the host
team of the Duke Invitational this
past Friday, and finished the tourna-
ment insecond place. The Panthers
split their matches on Saturday, los-
ing to Texas A&M and ending with a
sweep of Marquette.

Pitt 3, Duke 1

Pitt (2-1 overall) won its first
match, 3-1, against the Duke ‘Blue
Devils (0-3). It split the first two
games 30-26 and 27-30 before win-
ning the last two by scores of 30-21
and 30-20. _

Sophomore libero Megan
McGrane set a school record with 36

digs in a four-game match, and junior"

outside hitter Gini Ullery posted a
double-double for the Panthers, with
20 kills and 20 digs.

Senior outside hitters Wendy

Hatlestad and Sarah Rollman also

had strong performances for the
Panthers. Hatlestad added 16 kills

and 13 digs, while Rollman just
missed a doub1e—double with nine
kills and 20 digs.

Junior 1 middle hitter Megan

Miller had a team—best .275 hitting,

percentage, with 14 kills, and made
just three errors in 40 attempts.
Junior setter Lindsey Macke added
18 digs to go along with her match-
high 52 assists and three service aces.

Also 4 contributing to the
Panthers’, victory’ was sophomore
middle hitter Madelyn Egan, who had
a team-high five blocks.

Texas A&M, 3 Pitt 1

The Panthers allowed the Texas
A&M Aggies (3-0) to get the best of
them in their second match, losing in
four sets. 1

Three players, Ullery, Rollman,
and Miller, chipped in with double-
digit kills for the Panthers. All three
players finished with hitting percent-
ages higher than .300.

With 10 digs and a team-high 17

' kills, Ullery was one of two ‘players

Littlefield’s moves make sense Pitt sweeps Marquette, 3-0

Heller-LaBelle, page 15

We got Oliver Perez, a great, young
pitcher, and Jason Bay, who’s done
well since the trade. While Giles at
less than $10 million is a steal, those
two are better steals for a team that’s
rebuilding. ,

And then there’s Ramirez. The
shining example that Bucco fans
point to as the one we should have
kept, claiming that he was the epito-
me of building a player and keeping
him, the proposed mission of the new
management. Ramirez made $3 mil-
lion this year, which would be a great
price for his 34-home run, 112—RBI
season of 2001. But for a guy who’s
not hitting .300, he has an obvious
attitude problem and made 23 errors
in the first half of the season,
Littleﬁeld thought — and rightfully
so —— that he could do better.

And he will.

Littlefield is a smart man, and
good at his job. He knows that he has
to rebuild a team, and, to do that

effectively, you need to get rid of
some great players. You also need
young guys, like Bay, Perezand
Sanchez, instead of established play-
ers who are about to be free agents
your team can’t afford.

For years now, the Pirates have
had the “if everything goes right”
game plan. That plan’s not -getting it
done, and Littlefield knows that. It’s
not his fault that we invested too
much in the wrong type of players
and now need to save up some money
to reinvest in the right kind. Just like
it wasn’t manager Lloyd
McC1endon’s fault that his players
couldn’t ever put the wins together.

A good owner hires someone to
do a job and then lets him or her do it.
Before the entire city demands the
heads of Littlefield and McClendon
on a pike, maybe we should give

them a chance to do what they were

hired to, also.

to have doub1e—doubles for the
Panthers. ‘

Miller had 11 kills and one error
in 30 attempts and led the team with
a .333 hitting percentage. Rollman
had 13 kills in only 28 attempts to go
along with her seven digs.

Macke was the other player who
put up a double—double, leading the
team with 43 assists and adding 14
digs. McGrane posted 25 digs to lead
all players in the match.

Also contributing for the
Panthers were Egan, who had three
solo blocks and six blocking assists,
and Hatlestad, who had '10 digs and
eight kills. -

The loss dropped the Panthers to
1-1 in the tournament, while the
Aggies went to 2-0, having beaten
Marquette the previous day.

Pitt 3, Marquette 0

In their final match of the touma-
ment, Pitt swept the Marquette
Golden Eagles (1-2), 3-0, to finish in
second place for the tournament. The
Golden Eagles failed to keep the
momentum they had gained after a
five-game victory over Duke earlier
in the day. Pitt won the three games
by scores of 30-19, 30-23, and 30-24.

Ullery led the way with a match-

high 20 kills and a .421 hitting per-
centage. Hatlestad also posted dou-
ble-digit kills with 13 to go along
with her seven digs.

'Once again, Macke led everyone
with a match-high 40 assists. She
also added 10 digs to become the
only Pitt player with double-doubles
in all three matches.

McGrane put up 23 digs in the
match, giving her 84 total in just 11
games for a 7.64 digs per game aver-
age in the tournament. Last year,
McGrane averaged 4.68 digs per
game, which was good enough to ﬁn-
ish 10th in the NCAA.

Egan gave the Panthers five kills
in 11 attempts to go along with her
three blocks. Also contributing to the
victory were Miller, with four kills,
and Rollman, with five kills and nine
digs.

Ullery, McGrane and Hatlestad
were each All-Tournament team
selections.

In the final game of the touma-
ment, Texas A&M defeated Duke to
give it a tournament best 3-0 mark,
while Duke finished in fourth place
without a victory.

Pitt travels to Akron, Ohio, next
weekend to take part in the Sheraton
Zips Invitational against host Akron,
American University and nationally-
ranked Penn State. "
