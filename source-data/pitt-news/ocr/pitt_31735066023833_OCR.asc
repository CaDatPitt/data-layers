Vol.75, No.20

Pitt News Staff Writer _
Pitt’s funding problems for this
year are over, Chancellor Wesley

Posvar reported at yesterday’s fall

meeting of the board of trustees. _
Funding problems resulted from

the Liquor Control Board reneging’

on acommittement to provide $33
million in state revenue through a
ten-cent-a-bottle surcharge, and the
failure of the general assembly to
pass a licensing fee-bill this summer.

The budget shortfall then created
caused Governor Thornburgh to
schedulea ten percent across the
board slash in non‘-preferred ap-
propriations. These budget cuts left
open the possibility of a winter tui-
tion hike for Pitt students.

However, a. new LCB’ pricing
policy now in effect along with the
passage other appropriations bills,
has provided the necessary revenue
for Pitt.

Senate Bill 489, an adminstrative
fee bill, passed ‘last week allows
Thornburgh to raise budget revenue
estimates, and a new legislative ap-
propriations bill restores Pitt’s
original funding. J ' V *

Don '15 Expect Any Surprises
  A From Anderson, Lucey Says

By NICK ARNETT
Pitt News Staff Writer '

Don’t expect any surprises from
John Anderson. That’s the predic-
tion his running mate, Pat. Lucey,
made at a press conference at
Greater Pittsburgh International
Airport Wednesday. '

“The Anderson/Lucey ticket has
got to continue on course,” he said.

"‘The only ‘significant difference

will be that starting on Friday of
this week (today) we will have paid
television and radio commercials.”

“The only person capable of sur-
prises is the incumbent president,”
Lucey said. “Despite Jack Ander-
son’s column of’ several weeks ago

— (which suggested Carter would end

the Iranian; hostage crisis before

November 4th) I don’t expect» any
surprises there.” T

‘Carter is in the poorest position
of anyone running for president to
work something out with the (Ira-
nian) government,” Lucey added.
“A new president would have a bet-
ter chance. On the other hand, I’d
like nothing better than to see them
released this afternoon and let Jim-
my Carter get whatever political
benefit he's entitled to.”

Lucey said the campaign‘ has suf-
fered heavily because a lack of
money prevented them from com-
peting with Caiterand Reagan on
network television. He said they
had hoped for better results from
Anderson's debate, with Ronald
Reagan. ‘

Little Progress in Murder

B . . .
y  S’t‘aIl"fI\,’ﬁite:)N

There has been little progress
made in the investigation of the
execution-type slaying of--a Pitt stu-
dent, according to Sargeant. John
Flanningan, head of city homicide.

Robert Walker a theater arts stu-
dent at Pitt, was shot in the head on
Oct.4 during an apparent robbery
at Martini Imports in Oakland. His
arms’ and legs were bound and a
cloth was tied around his head. He
died the following day at
Presbyterian-University Hospital.

On the day of the slaying the
owner‘of the store, Summer Good-
win, called Walker on the the
telephone and a undentiﬁed man
answered and hung up. When
Goodwin" called the store again,
there was no answer, and he became
suspicious. He called a nearby'- store
he owned and asked a clerk to
check on Walker.’ When the clerk
went to the store, Walker was not to

“We allowed ourselves to -expect

Livewire:'Food Service Move-
To Forbes Irks Residents

' By SCOTT SELTZ
. Pitt News Staff Writer

As a result of renovations‘
scheduled for Schenley Hall next
year, a proposed relocation cite has
been selected for the university’s
catering service in Forbes Hall dor-
mitory. However, this proposal has
met with considerable opposition
from the residents and the Forbes
Hall_ Council of the Resident Stu- .
dent Association’,-

Although. a set decisionhas not
yet been reached by Tom Albert,
director of auxilary services, and
Roger Taylor,—_ director of space
management, concerning the
Forbes Hall site, ‘the Forbes Hall
council and residents have felt that

Ntheirinput in this decision has been
neglected.

The council feels that such

relocation to the dorm would hay

degenerating effects on the quality 

of resident life at Forbes Hall.
Several points against the reloca-

tions were contained in an outling 
composed by the council. The
outline stated that,“the educational, '
environment and quality of life at c ’

Pitt would surely suffer while 
business (interests) prosper if a_ _ f " '

In addition, the outline expressed

installed in A '

concern that the installation of the ,  ’_ 

catering service would inevitably
create problems of security, sanita-
tion, health, and noise levels for the
residents.

Representatives of the council

the year to discuss alternatives to

the current practices and to the .

ways and means to exercise sup-
port, Posvar said.

The board of trustees also passed ,

a resolution yesterday that _allows
the university to borrow funds in
the event regularly scheduled ap-
propriations from the Com-
monwealth are delayed. The univer-
sity will be permitted to borrow up
to $10 million, according to the
resolution. I ~

The board also decided to award
Master o.f Fine, Arts degrees to

students who successfully complete .

the English Department's creative
writingprogram.

Academic Affairs Committee
chairman Holmes Wolf said that Ir-
win Shulman and the English
department requested that a Master
of Fine Arts degree be awarded
under these circumstances:

-The student is connected with
the English department in the areas
of creative. writing rather than
literature; .

-The student has had advanced A

training in creative writing.
Previously, a Master of Arts had

‘\ been awarded to creative writing

majors. ‘

“A Master of Arts degree does
not have the ‘clout a more specific
degree would,” Wolf said. He add-

ed there was “no extra expense in- .

volved” in awarding the MFA, and
that he believed it would attract
more students to the university.‘ _
Wolf also reported that the
academic affairs committee had

(   “if

“wen” -     

 

“There is. much in the media
about abuse,” Wolf said. He ex-
plained there has been a continual]

- review of admissions standards for

athletes, recuritment procedures,

and maintence of student standings.

Wolﬁsaid the committee has con-
cluded the university is in com-
pliance with NCAA rules, and that
he believes Pitt is more stringent
than other universities in deman-
ding academic standards for
athletes.

Lucey  

‘ have to admit that the choices of-

fered by the two traditional parties
are really pretty dismal.”

Blaming the lack of advertising
on a lack of money, Lucey
acknowledged that the campaign is
a million dollars in debt.

.“We’re trying to get just as deep- .

ly in debt as. we can,” he said.
“Then we’ll pay it back when we
get the retroactive funding from

the FEC (Federal Election Commis-

sion).”
Anderson must win at least five

percent of the vote to qualify for '

the FEC money. Lucey said a‘ pro-
ject to borrow money from past
contributors has succeeded, which

he called “most encouraging.” He »

said the borrowed money will be
repaid with eight percent interest.

Lucey said their supporters are
hard to identify.

“We'don’t have a clear consti-
tuency because we’re- not a one-
issue campaign. Weire not a George
Wallace, or a Henry Wallace, for
that matter. Our constituency ‘is
harder "to identify because we are
within the mainstream. We are a
centrist-campaign; We would hope
to draw people from all walks of
life,” he added.

“I do see an increase in Basic
Educational Opportunity Grants to
reﬂect inflation increases,” he said.

“On the other hand,” Lucey
continued, “he would ‘be _very
tough on repayment of loans so the

money could be recycled into the '

fund for the next generation of
students.” Lucey said aid to educa-
tion is repaid to the government by
college—educated people who pay
higher taxes because they are in
higher-paying occupations.

“We can well afford to support
education at lowinterest rates or no
interest,” he said".

The vice-presidential candidate
said he hoped there would be a.
larger turnout among college-age
voters than in past presidential elec-
tions. «

“In every school poll that I’ve
seen, John ‘Anderson is the
w1nner,” said‘Lucey. -5

He compared the election to ‘his
past races for governor and lieute-
nantgovernor in Wisconsin.

“Iused to be very anxious to hear
the school polls,” he said, “because
it was my experience that if I did
well in the school polls, I won the
election. . . .I wish it worked ‘that
way in presidential politics.”

6   It’s Time fo the Backyard Brawl  

, By JEFF DUROSKO
‘ , Pitt News Sports Editor
With both teams coming off

_ tough losses last week, tomorrow’s '
» Pitt—West Virginia game looks to be

an old fashioned all-out city boys

0 _ versus country boys shootout. The
r ’ Panthers were defeated by Florida

State 36-22 while WVU lost to

~  Hawaii 16-13. And the bitter rivals
_ will c1ash‘heads for the 73rd time

with kick off set for 1:30 p.m.

 A team generally comes off a loss
fighting like an alley cat engaged in
a"/brawl and the Mountaineers are
fighting to stay alive in the chase for
‘a post season bowl bid with a 4-2

‘ record. Both teams’ coaches blame

mistakes for last week’s losses.

I .“We simply made too many
mistakes and they cost usvthe ball
game,”
Nehlen. “Our team gave it a good

(effort; but you can’t make a lot of

mistakes and expect to win football
games.” ‘

Pitt coach Jackie Sherrill echoed
Nehlen’s remarks « following last.

. Saturday’s game. .

“You can’t win by making

mistakes,” said Sherrill, “and mak-

‘ ing as many mistakes as we did.”

The Panthers are looking to
regroup for a big game this week
against West--Virginia. After the
defense was literally picked apart
last"’week, defensive coordinator

p Foge Faziohas been preparinghis

troops throughout the week.
Though the Pitt defense had ,its

problems withthe Seminoles‘ last

week, it still continues to rank na-

’ tionally in three categories. Accor-
ding to this week’s NCAA statistics, -

the Pitt defense is number one in
the country against the rush, allow-
ing just 57.4 yards per game. The
Panthers are also number four in
total defense (200.2 yards per game)
and 13th against the score (11.2
points per game).

. The Mounties will bring ‘with

them two key offensive men.
Quarterback Oliver, Luck, who had

' limited playing against Hawaii, will

"come into Pitt_Stadium ready to
play, according to Nehlen. He has
the ability to throw long or short,
ruit with the ball, and throw effec-
tively ‘while on the run. WVU also
boasts of tailback Robert Alex-
ander who is averaging l38.yards

rushing, ranking him among the ‘

country’s top 10 ground gainers.

One of the promises to Chipman _

when he took over the reigns was to I
expand the Field House. C'Ovnstruc-
tion of bleachers that are over the
student's side will add approximate-
ly 1,000 new seats for all home
games. According to Dean Billock,
Pitt’s director of sports informa-
tion, the new seating capacity of the
arena will be 6,360, ‘up from last
years total of 5308.

“The university has met the com-
mitment that we were promised,”
Chipmansaid. “We are looking
forward to a successful season.”

last years’ squad: Sammie E1115 and-
Dave Underwood. -This years’ team
will have five seniors which will be a

' plus for Chipman.

While Pitt “can” run the ball,
the. Panther rushers have shown’
little success thus far this season. In
five games, Pitt has gained just 563
yards rushing, with Randy
McMillan leading the pack with a
total of 247 yards on 65 carries.

McMillan said he has beenhappy
with his season thus far» because,

_ ‘fWe have a good thing going with

more but every back should‘ say
that.”

and in particular Ricky Jackson and
Hugh Green. '

to Chipman, both have been in-
strumental in his transition to Pitt’s
Program. '

“Clancy has been a great help to
me,” Chipman said. “We have
developed a good relationship. ‘We

will use him more in our offensive '

philosophy',_to rebound more and
to score more.” ‘

“Neverson isthe biggest suprise
to me,” he added. “He has great
leadership and is an, outstanding
player, He will fit into the scheme
that I want to develop. I’m very
pleasedwith what l’ve seen.”

In addition to Clancy and Never-
son, some other players that the
Panthers will need production-out_
of are Dave Olinger, Dwayne
Wallace, Lennie McMillian and
Darrell Gissendanner.‘ Chipman

ic About Season

Coach Chipman has ‘also
recruited a new coaching staff to
help him shape the Pitt program.
Assistant coach Reggie Warfordi is
originally from Kentucky and has
served as both assistant and co-
coach at Iowa State the past four
years. Accordint to Chipman, he is
an excellant recruiter which is what
Pitt really needs.

Assistant coach Seth Greenberg
will be the primary man in charge of
recruiting for Chipman. He-is
originally from New York and has
coached previously -at Fordham
University. ' '

Chipman’s final coach is Dave
Progar, who will be the Panthers
part—time assistant coach. He was
previously the head coach at Fox
Chapel high

“We’re going to run, ‘be ag-

Chipman said. “We want to‘ make
the fans happy but it will not hap-

We have intelligent players and
will adjust when necessary. The

main goalis to’ win basketball-

Chipman is also concerned about
the academic part of his player's
life. I _

 Boone Struggles - A   I
r  As Player Rep

 

 

 

By The Associated Press

PHILADELPI-lIA——Phillies’

- catcher Bob Boone has struggled all

season-first with his role ‘as Na-
tional League player representative
during the maddening negotiations
over a new standard contract, then
with...a slow-to-respond, surgically
repaired left knee, then with a bat-
ting average that dipped to a career
low .229 after three straight years
over .280. «

Through it all, his wife, Sue, has
faithfully trooped out to Veterans
Stadium and suffered with him.

As Bob’s total of sickly pop-ups
with men on base mounted and the
boos continued to innundate her in
the.wives’ section behind first base,
Sue Boone reached back for one of
the lessons her husband had insisted
‘she learn early.

‘?He’s never taken the games
home with him,” she said Wednes-
day night before .the start of Game

‘Two of the World Series. “Ever

since the year when he was on the

3 bench, with his bad back, when
Johnny Oates was catching 1975, he’

realized that most of what happens
is beyond your control.

. “All you can do is the best you
can do and not worry about the rest
and‘I learned then that I.couldn’t let.
this affect me, either.” -

“Listen, no one likes to hear her
husband booed. I’m the first to ad-

mit that fans have every right to

boo people who they feel aren’t “

producing. But if the fans only
knew the extent of the pain he’s
playing in every night, I don’t think
they’d be so quick'to boo him.”
“-I think the intelligent fans under--
stand this and the intelligent fans
also know that, defensively, therefs
not a better catcher around. Offen-
sively, he hasn’t hit at all. I can’t
understand how people can ‘come
out here and boo a team that has
given them such good baseball over
the pastfive years.”

Sons Bret, 11, and Aaron, 7, who
sat on Sue’s knee‘ during Wednes-
day night’s_ game, love to accom-

5 pany her to the ballpark. Matt

Boone turned 1 this summer-a bad
age for baseball-so Sue had to miss
more.games than she would have
liked this year for his sake. But she
made it to Houston for the final
three games of the playoffs and was
here Tuesday night for Bob’s big
three-hit, two RBI game, one that

had the fans screaming their ap-_

proval.

she admits‘ unblushingly.

I don’t know how people will take

You win some and you lose some.
Wednesday afternoon the Pan-
therette netters completed a
previously suspended match with

Slippery Rock, losing by a 5-4,

score. However,. the Pantherettes
roared back to take the second
match 7-2. Their season record now
stands at 4-'4. ‘
The singles competition was

i almost identical in. both matches.

Randi Belkin rolled to’ her eighth
win_ against no losses this season,
knocking off Sissy Baglieri, 7-5,
6-1. Belkin had defeated Baglieri

earlier by a 7-6, 6-0 score. Cathy
Jacobson handed.Sharon_ Sirpilla a
6-1 , 6-1 loss, as she had done earlier
with a 7-5, 6-2 win. Lisa LaFuria-
made Kim Clark hervictim in both
matches. LaFuria struggled to vic-
tory in the first match, 5-7, 6-0, 6-1,
butcame back to easily stop Clark,
6-0, 6-2.

On October. 1, the date of the
suspended match, Slippery Rock

BY COLLEEN McDONALD

Pitt’s women field hockey team
may make the regionals this year.‘

. The outlook is good. Coming off
their fourth win against Hiram last
‘week, the Pantherettes wenton to
polish off Bethany on Tuesday, 6-2.

;‘ It isiwith a clean 5-0 record that the
‘ Pantherettes will

face Slippery
Rock this afternoon. .

“If we want to get a regional bid,

we have to beat Slippery Rock and ’

Bucknell,” said Coach Martha
Ludwig. “We won against Hiram
4-0, with 41 shots on goal opposed
-to their two shots.”

The Pantherettes dominated’

throughout the entire game‘. The
leading scorer was Dee Dee Katner
with two goals, followed by for-

. wards Libby Sharp and Margie’
‘Hall, both" wit‘h one goal.
 1“‘We were -able to switch to a
~ ."‘-'_new strategy in the second half of -

the Hiram game,” Ludwig said;
= ~On their home field against

1  ‘Bethany, Pitt dominated again.
7 eV“§‘.,“I'his is my fourth year coaching
~ ‘ Bethany field hockey and this is the,

i  ‘first time we played against

  Pitt,"’Bethany coach Sally Dor-

"‘n1ont said before‘ the game.“Our

-r‘éEord is 4-5, but.we’re trying to

can learn. a lot "from Pitt. We’re

them today.” Dormont’s predic-
tion proved right; Two minutes in-
to the firsthalf, "Pitt’s Katner flick-
ed an assist to Hall, who scored the
first goal on a push-in. Bethany

tes evened the match score at 3-3
with Lynn Poznanski defeating‘

_Jody Mattioli, 6-1, 6-3.

It looked as though‘ the same
thing was going to happen Wednes-
day. Jan Stottlemeyer again turned‘
back Kastory, this time by a 6-3, 6-3
score. Lynn Poznanski served Mat-
tioli a 6-1, 6-0 loss. However, in a
key match for the Pantherettes,
Lisa Weinberg turned the tables on
Beth Fedorowich, 1-6,6-3,6-2.

“That match showed the im-
provement that Lisa (Weinberg) has
been making all year” said coach
Fran Webster. “It gave us a little bit

of an edge going into doubles, and

peful for aRegionaI Bid

came back immediately catching the
Pantherettes off guard as Bethany

forward, Eileen Reading made,
made a high flicking goal tieing the

score 1-1. .

we haven’t had that too much this
year.” "

The Pantherettes used that edge-

to sweep the doubles competition, a

_ first for the team this season. Belkin

and Jacobson teamed to stomp all
over Clark and Fedorowich, 6-0,
6-2. The duo still has only one loss
this year. Lisa Weinberg and Gret-
chen Raak outlasted Poznanski
and_Diane Easly, 7-5,7-6.-V .

“They showed the greatest im-
provement on the day,” explained
Webster. '

In the suspended match,
Weinberg had coupled with Jody
Mattioli, but Easly and Poznanski

scored Pitt’s second goal with a
beautiful reverse stick shot against
Bethany’s goalie, Val Morris.

Pitt News Staff Writer

\

After last week’s tournament in

Houston, the Pantherette volleyball '

team will again be facing nationall
ranked competition in Cineinatti.

Out of the 12 teams scheduled ‘to
play, Pitt will face four that are
ranked in the top twenty. Coach

‘ Shelton Collier expects the match

up with number 12 ranked Purdue
to‘ pose the greatest threat.

“I've had some chances to scout
these teams and I found Purdue to

, be one of the strongest teams in

the country,” Collier said. “They
have a variety of techniques and a

‘ number of strong and experienced

players,‘_ai_1d they will probably be

)9’

In the round robin play before
the play-off rounds, Pitt will also
face no.l4 Nebraska, no.l6 Ohio
State, no.l9 University of Ken:
tucky, and Cleveland State.

“Right now the East is regarded
as one of the weakest volleyball
regions in the country,” Collier
said. “In order for us to improve

we need to go out and play these na- 7

tionally ranked teams.”

After disappointments in their’
showing at Houston, the’Panther-'
ettes are making some adjustments.
in their technique.

“Also,” Collier added, “we

opinion, she’s the top athelete on

Last year Pitt won this tourna-
ment and is this year’s defending
c h a m p i o n . -

_“We’re defending a title this
year,“Collier said, “but it wasn't
nearly as strong. This year‘ there
will be a lot of highly ranked teams
that weren’t around last year.”

This will be an important
weekend for us in terms of our na-
tional exposure,’ said Collier. ,“If

for them to get through it without
getting down. I prayed for Him to
give them the strength to accent the
outcome, whatever it was. because I
knew how badly they all wanted to
win.”

Rock

‘had defeated them, 6-1, 6-2.-

LaFuria and Kastory came back to
beat Nelson and Stottlemeyer,
7-6, 1-6, 6-3,.in the second match.
With the sweep of the doubles,
Pitt had earned a 7-2 win over Slip-
pery Rock. The Rockettes clinched
the ‘suspended match, 5-4, with a

\win from Louise Nelson and Jan

Stottlemeyer. The duo defeated
LaFuria and Kastory, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.
Belkin and Jacobson had defeated
Clark and Fedorowich, 6-1, 6-2.»
Thus the Pantherettes were able to

-win pnly one of the three doubles
matches in the October‘ 1 match,
giving Slippery Rock the 5-4* w,'n_

therettes ahead even further when a
goal by Jane Strause upped the
score 3-1. However, Reading fired
back against the Pantherettes with
her second goal. '

Bethany to two points. An outstand
ing effort was then made by Katner;
she made back to back goals. One
was a high flick into the cage, the

"second (on a corner situation) was a

fast drive off an assist by Sharp.
The Pantherettes were ahead 5-2.
Pitt’s Sue Shaheen scored the last
goal of the game to finish the score

"6-2.

Ludwig said the team was involv-
ed in some non-league play in bet-
ween. the -Hiram and Bethany
games. -

“We travelled to Windsor, New
York, to compete in the Midwest
Umpiring Conference against a few
club teams,” she said. “This is
Where the officials go to get rated.
We played Lancashire, Finger
Lakes and Central New York‘ Clubs
and we lost only to Lancashire.”
The club-teams, which mainly con-

,Sist of post-college women players,

were strong competition and several '
of the teams were impressed with
the way we played, Ludwig added.

ing, Pitt travels to Slippery-Rock to-
