Women's Issues Taught

By NANCY E. WORK
Pitt News Staff Writer '

In an increasingly complex socie-
ty where women’s roles have chang-
ed dramatically, there is a depart-
ment on campus that can provide
students with an insight about those
problems women experience.

The Women’s Studies Program
(WSP), dedicated and committed to
a feminist philosophy of social,
political, and economic equality of
the sexes, offers courses which
enable students to investigate and
re-examine some basic assumptions
surrounding women in today’s
society.

“Women’s studies offers a new
perspective for the evaluation ‘of
ideas and information- Tradi-

scholars have looked
mainly at the achievements and
positions of‘ men. Women’s
studies, itself a distinct academic
tradition and’ method, explores
reasons for the absence of research
on women, uncovers and affirms
what the
achievements of women have been,
compares‘ the achievements of
women in various cultures, in dif-
ferent periods of history,.and pro-

jects by example and theory new‘

possibilities and choices for women
in both‘ their personal and profes-
sional lives,” according to a
descriptive program leaflet.

Campus Police Chief Curt
Graham has been transfered and
reappointed as director of property
management, according to John
Vrana, assistant vice chancellor for
business and finance.-

In addition, the position of cam-
pus police chief has been retitled to
director of public safety because of
the four-fold responsibilities involv-
ed: police, parking,,campus bus,
and security. A national search is
currently underway to fill , the

position vacated by Graham.,

Director of property manage-

nalized;    

of Social Work. The English
Department will be expanded also.

Humanities that are scattered
throughoutythe campus will be con-
solidated in the Cathedral. These
include the Classics and. the
Philosophy departments.

Roger Taylor, director of space

management, sees the move as ad- »

vantagious to students.

“This plan is ‘better for the
students, it can consolidate major
things on one floor, and make them
more efficient,’.’- he said.

Taylor concedes that there will be

1 some short-run problems, but in the
long run, registration will become
much more efficient and lines will
be shortened.

“Our firstvstep is to move people

out of the Cathedral of'Learning I

and int0NIervis Hall,” according
to Freeman.

The first phase, moving Payroll/
‘Benefits, Deferred Payments,
Employment Services, and the
assistant vice chancellor of human

- resources to theﬁrst ﬂoor of Mervis

Hall, is to be accomplished by the
end of summer. ’,

The second phase, moving the
Registrar’s, Student Accounts’, and
the Cashiers’ offices to the ground
floor, is expected to be completed
by January. Students will still go to
the Cathedral for these_services un-

Minority representation on the
campus, after the numerous’ land-
mark court cases and civil rights
"suits of the past decade, has made
enough gains to establish blacks
and other minorities as important
and recognized contributors to the
overall academic quality of higher

education. ,
Blacks and women are ﬁnding in-
creasing options open to them to-
day in education. These are the

' result of a continuing struggle by ,

"organized and individual forces -to
expand the opportunities available
within an academic setting.

 

. *  . 2 2;

Organizations such as the
Women’s Equity Action League
(WEAL), a relatively unknown
women's civil rights group, led the
way in, federal enforcement of affir-
mative action when they filed a
discrimination suit against the en-,
tire academic community in 1970.

Here at Pitt, names such as Dr.
M. Oskoui, Yusef Ali, Cathleen
Gentilcore, Curtiss Porter, ‘and
organized governing groups like the
Black Action Society have served to
place increased administrative em-
phasis on the inclusion of minorities
in Pitt’s recruitment and employ-

Blad< Graduate Caucus At Pitt Seeks

sional’ Student Caucus, a
50-member organization composed
entirely of black graduate students,
is another organized group which
has served the needs and interests of
an often unrecognized student
population.

Overall, the organization’s ac-
tivities are less concerned with
changing the system than working
within it. They attempt to assist
black graduate students in problems
which are unique or apply .speci-
fically to them.

One of these activities is the
development of an orientation pro-
gram for incoming black graduate

and professional students, to be

held at the beginning of the fall
term.
“It will be our responsibility to

‘help these students make the

physical and psychological adjust-
ments conductive to the high level
of performance required for’ sur-

' I vival within the university com-

munity,” states the organization as
one of their objectives in the 1978
constitution. I -

Within this objective is “gaining

the cooperation of department

heads across campus in giving us
the names of ’ incoming black
students,” according to Clifford
Charles, who is presently working
on i, his master’s degree in Clinical
Psychology and is president of the
Black Graduate and Professional
Student Caucus. - - ' —

-The organization has a total of
nine ojbectives in their constitution,
but “every year we have to reinter-
pret those goals,” Charles said, im-
plying that the goals are only ends

and “the means used to attain those
ends vary.”

The organization also strives to
develop the channels of communi-
cation between black graduate
students through 'a newsletter, en-
titled the “Cultivator.”

In the newsletter are included any
number of things happening in the
Pitt community which are relevant
to black graduate students,” stated
Charles.

“Facilitating communication is
one of the problems everyone seems
to complain of,” Charles said.
“Through communication of
knowledge you have a heightened
level of awareness.” .

The Black Graduate and Profes-
sional Student Caucus is also very
active beyond Pitt, where the)’
focus some of their energies in
black communities such as Home-
wood, East Liberty, and the Hill
District.

“We are very concerned. about
taking a responsible position
towards the community,” Charles
said. “As citizens, we want to take.
an active part.”

“The black community is looking
towards those blacks with skills and
education for direction,” Charles
said, referring to the desire of many
blacks for outspoken and dynamic
leaders.

Acknowledging the high cost of
graduate and-post-graduate tuition
and the inability of many blacks to
afford-the fees, one of the organiza-
tion’s primary goals is “interpreting
and investigating” the Vari0uS
sources of financial ‘assistance

available to black graduate
students.

“As we hear of sources of finan-
cial aid, we feel ;it _is our respon-
sibility to make this information
known to our members,” Charles
said.

At times, the organization will
take an investigative role in seeking
out the sources of aid, and go
beyond what the campus ﬁnancial
aid office might have to offer.

However, Charles said that as an
organization, one of their main
concerns is with the number of
black faculty at Pitt.
graduate students see faculty as
‘fcolleagues” in their academic rela-
tionships, according to Charles.

“The presence of black faculty
serves as a_ valuable source of input
to students,” Charles said. “They
have good suggestive input as to
how we might go about attaining
our objectives.”

. Many .

The Black Graduate and Profes- 

sional Student Caucus is constantly
bringing in speakers, focusing on
Pitt’s administrators and faculty,

with the system here ‘at Pitt,”
according to Charles.

Today, June 18 in Room 419 of
the Student Union at 5 p.m., Dr.
Maryann Bishop Coffey, director
of Pitt’s affirmative action pro-
gram, will be speaking to the
organization at‘ their semi-monthly
meeting.

The group is supported wholly by

Two Pitt students were part of

the first‘ 35 recipients ‘of a major

new fellowship program for minori-
ty post-doctoral scholars.

It was announced last Tuesday by »

the National Research Council and
the Ford Foundation that Maria
Luisa Nunes and Michael Allen
Mares are part of the 35 recipients
of the fellowships. The National

national sports car race in a row in
Ohio two Sundays ago. Bob Fryer
of Bridgeville, the driver of the stu-
dent organization’s Trans-Am
Javelin, won the race at the Nelson
Ledges Speedway in Warren, Ohio.

The race began in the rain with

most of the cars mounted on rain "

tires. "Half way through the one-
hour event t e track dried, and the
cars on dry tires started moving up
through the field. However, the
lead that Fryer built up at the begin-
ning_of the race was sufficient to
overcome the fast-closing, second

‘place. Ford Mustang, by 13 seconds.

The University of Pittsburgh
team is now leading the race stan-
dings for North Eastern United
States in the G.T.'-l category.

Piﬂ Educators Meet to Discuss Future of Education

The impact of rapid

created problems in educational
systems, according to a leading Pitt
educator. _

Dr. Wilma B. Smith, chairperson
Of the Division Of Educational
Development and Service in the

School fo Education, discussed the.

future of education in a speech titl-
ed, “Education: The l980’s and
Beyond.”
A Smith Dresented the speech
before the 6th Annual Colloquium
of the Council of Graduate
Students in Education, on Saturday
in Forbes Quadrangle.

According to Smith, techno-

spending the time studying abroad.

The Nationality Rooms and In-
tercultural Exchange ‘ Programs
have selected 13 students to repre-
sent Pitt in 10 different countries
this summer. The program, now in
its 32nd year, has awarded 259

scholarships amounting to over
$210,000 during_ that time.

she is “becoming habituated "to

educational system. She said the
system was both an agent and
respondent of socialchange,

Six agents of change that will
have an impact on educational
systems are: demographic changes,
technological innovations, inven-
tionof new styles and arrangements
in organization, cultural value

, shifts, ecological changes and infor-

mation ideas shift. All these factors
interrelate and change each other,..
Smith said.

Future problems threatening the
system are: a majority of the
population in the next 20 years will
be an aging one; an exodus to
suburbia will leave the cities to
deteriorate; the ‘proportion of
unemployed will steadily increase;
and the traditional definition of the

honors.

Travelling to Russia for the first
time is Linda Harrison, the Helen
Pool Rush awardee. Harrison, who
wrote from Germany, where she
made a brief stop-over visit, said
that her “German is fast improv-
ing” but she is “nervous about her
trip to the U.S.S.R.” Harrison will i.
study Russian at Leningrad State

itself. With this there needs to be a

learned “internal discipline” which I

can be accomplished by an assess-
ment of one’s own skills, according
to Smith.

‘ In order to carve out a place in
the future, educators must make
decisions. “Clarify your own
values,” be accommodating, try
new behaviors and bring out the
highest potential in every human
possible, were some of the future
goals she suggested.

Following Dr. Smith’s speech
was a panel discussion about future
problems of the system with: Dr.
Cynthia Sutherland, coordinator,
Women’s Studies Program; Dr.
Dennis Donham, assistant vice

Pape 'Jr. (David Lawrence Award),
Janet Simon (Vira Heinz Award),

Greetings from Silicon Valley,

 -- Califomial No, that doesn't mean
 the women here have had breast

operations. That's silicone, this is
silicon. A silicon is not a prisoner
who makes a joke. They call it
Silicon Valley because they make
computers here. The silicon is used
to create integrated circuits for the
" computers.

You know what it takes to make
computers? Right, it takes
nerds—lots of nerds. One out of
every three people here has a
calculator hanging from his belt.
It’s like wandering through Pitt’s
‘engineering school.

Supporting the thousands of
nerds are tens of thousands of
drones. Drones are stupid nerds. A
typical occupation for a drone is
‘installer’ or ‘assembler.’ A drone
sits at a desk with a soldering iron.
He/she takes a printed circuit board

' and installs one part on it, then-

passes it to the next drone. Drones
spend eight hours a day inserting
tab A into slot A. They are not easy
to talk to.
“What did you do at work to-
day?” I asked a drone coming out

i   of a building labeled “Manufactur-

ing_n
. ,“What?” she asked, startled by
this interruption in her daily
routine. ‘
“What did you do at work to-

‘ ‘day?”

“I went to the candy machine
twice. Ihad lunch. NowI’m going
home for dinner. Then I’ll sleep.”

“That’s it?”

“What more could a person
want?”

I decided further interviewing
was useless.

My roommate encountered a
housekeeping department made up

_ entirely of drones where he works.

    
    
   

.\' '

  Nerds And

Drones In
Silicon’

Valley

He noted that his carpet had not
been vacuumed and his wastebasket
had not been emptied since he had
arrived two weeks previously. He
called the housekeeping people.

“Section four-oh-three.”

“Uh, is this housekeeping?”

“Of course it is.”

“This is David Land in Technical
Publications--” . '

“Hold on.” The drone put him
onhold. “Mr. Land,” it resumed

' five minutes later.’ “Mr. Land, we

do not have form 345.8 regarding
you. I’m afraid I can't answer your
question until you fill it out.”

-“But I haven’t asked it.”

“It makes no difference. I must
have it to fill out a 301-B inquiry
and voucher form.” —

“Where do I get the first one?”

“Here.”

“Where are you?”

“Building 23,’ sector 3, cubicle
27, desk number 7.” The line went
dead.

Three days later, Dave finished
ﬁlling out the form. He handed it
to the drone.

“Now can I get my ‘wastebasket
emptied?”

“No. It’s my lunch hour, and
besides, you just signed a ‘form
which says you will only make in-
quiries over the phone. Goodbye.”

Dave called that afternoon.

“Hold on, Mr. Land. I have to
get your form.” Ten minutes lat-
ter, the drone returned to the
phone.

Well? What is it?”- -

“I’d like my wastebasket emp-
tied.”

“Where is it?”

“In my cubicle.”

“What’s the number, Mr.
Land?”

“Building five, Sector G-4, cubi-
cle 17.” ,

“Just a moment.” Another long
pause. “Mr. Land, we don’t have a
form 3-13 showing that you are
authorized to have a wastebasket in
that cubicle. Where did you get
it?” —
“From an empty cubicle.”

f»‘Mr. Land! You may not move
furniture without filling out a 713-B
and having it approved by security
and your department head.”

“I’ll put it back.”

“You’d better do it when no
one’s looking. Youwant some ad-
vice, Land?”

‘(No.93

“I don’t think

“Bye.” n /

Dave empties his trash himself on
Fridays. I’m worried about mine
now.’ I’ve been there three days
now and it hasn’t been emptied.
I’m afraid to tell anyone it’s there.

The Senate voted 58-34 to back
funding and end the filibuster
against President Carter’s proposal
to revive draft registration. The bill
will be passed within three days and
the House has already approved it.
The bill states that young men
born in 1960 and 1961 will be re-

‘quired to register in late July or ear-

ly August.

The current- legislation will
allocate $13.2 million to set up the‘
registration process. An actual

draft would require separate legisla-

tron. -

Both the. Senate and the House
have rejected the possibility, of
registering women, but the
American Civil Liberties Union said
to only register men was
discriminatory. A court case is cer-

With the presidential election
nearing, Ronald Reagan, who is op-
posed to peacetime registration and
a draft, may attract much appeal
from young voters. ,

“No one is certain how extensive

resistance will be, and the op-.

ponents of registration

are generally more sympathetic to
the military now than their counter-
parts were in the Vietnam era,” ac-
cording to an article in the New

Those resisters planning to

migrate to Canade in the wake of a
draft, will ﬁnd it more difficult than
their predecessorsdid ten years ago.

“The rules have changed to the
extent that draft dodgers to Canada

perience in their educational field of
endeavor,” said Maurice Benoit,

and, immigration officer at the

Canadian consulate in Detroit.
Draft counserlors ‘claim that of
the four million eligible young men,
if two percent or 80,000 did not
register, there wouldn’t be enough
room in federal prisons, which ac-

comodate 26,000.
Despite this, a number of anti-

draft registration ‘groups have
already planned for demonstra-

Fans Protest slackoiii on Local Television ‘ .

By ANTHONY MILES -
Pitt News Staff Writer

Ross Scott defended his World
Heavyweight Kickboxing title on
Sunday against number two ranked
Jacquet Bazemore. Bazemore is a
27 year old East Liberty resident
who had trained many years for this
ﬁght. With a solid 15 and one
record, Bazemore had hoped to
become the new world champion.

However, Bazemore could not

‘ fulﬁll his dream. The champ suf-

fered a ’ third round knockout
against Scott.

Scott received a bloody nose -in
the first round, and later needed
some six stitches in his right eye.
However Bazemore was dropped in
the second round by a left hook.
Finally, the referee stopped the
light after Bazemore was knocked
down three times in the third round.
The fight was supposed to have
been televised by KDKA if time per-
mitted, but the Bill Wallace vs.
Bobby Biggs bout consumed too
much time.’ “

Local Fans Protest

; Fans, friends and students of
martial arts had protested to get the
fight on television in the Pittsburgh
area.

Thursday, June 12, students
from the Pennsylvania Karate
Academy and the Academy of
Chinese boxing held a non-violent
protest. Students from the two
schools plus friends and fans of
Bazemore walked around
downtown Pittsburgh with signs

. Striking members of the
.Operating Engineers Local 95, who
had been out since 3 p.m. June 2,
went back to work on Monday.
According to Tom Cherry, Pitt’s
union negotiator, “The settlement
was less than the union wanted and
more than the university had

‘ originally offered.”

The specific terms of the negotia-
tions must be incorporated into the
new contract before it is signed.
Cherry hopes to have the contract

A signed by the end of the week.

protesting KDKA for not including
their hero in the television schedule.

Later, KDKA did announce that
"instead of showing an old movie as
previously planned, they would
televise the fight of Bazemore.

According to Rick Lengyel, Baze-
more’s manager, “There just is not
enough support from the media and
people of Pittsburgh.” When asked
what wasneeded for the champ,
Lengyel said that the champ needs
sparring partners and even more
important, sponsors for financial
support.

“It's a shame, the city of Pitts-
burgh has a world contender and
does not support him,” Lengyel
said. The fight and trip to Ander-
son, Indiana was quite different
than had been expected.

Lengyel said that Joe Corley,
Coordinator for the Professional
Karate Association (PKA) did not
plan very well. ‘

“We (Bazemore and- Manager)
didn’t even receive a schedule, it
seemed as though everyone had to
cater to CBS’ wishes,” Lengyl said.
Kickboxing, similar to just about
every other sport, demands a lot of
time and effort.

Kickboxers Maintain Discipline

According to Lengyel, Jacquet
Bazemore trains anywhere from
eight to nine hours a day. Every
morning at 4:30 a.m., Bazemore
runs five to ten miles. After return-
ing home and resting, at approx-
imately 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.,
Bazemore trains working out with

These specifics will not be released
until that time.

The strike was the result of strict-
ly monetary differences, according
to. negotiators.

airshields, punching and kicking
bags. Finally, from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m.
he trains again.’

So for a scheduled 24 minute
flight, in ten weeks of working out,
Bazemore trained for approximate-
ly 32,040 minutes. »

As ﬁghters, Bazemore’s manager
characterized Ross Scott as a slug-
ger ‘and Bazemore a technician,
citing that Scott’s fights never go
beyond four rounds. He added that
the only Scott fight to go beyond
four rounds was when Bazemore
beat Scott in seven.

Manager Criticizes Bout
In a reconstruction of the
Bazemore vs. Scott fight, Lengyel
was not happy with the bout. In a
kickboxing match, each round con-

sists of two minutes of fighting with
a minute between rounds.to rest.
Before the fight actually begins, the
fighters do the same as boxers,
warm up. It is imperative in
kickboxing that the fighters stretch.

According to Lengyel, CBS did
not even give Bazemore a chalice to
stretch.

The officiating may not have
also been up to par.

“In my opinion, Bob Yarnell, the
referee, did not have control of the
fight,” Lengyel said.

According to Lengyel, in the first
round, Scott put his thumb in
Bazemore’s eye, which he. thought
should have been rulled a foul.
Even more obvious, during a break.

Scott punched Bazemore in the
head and again no foul was called.
Before the round was over, Scott
received a broken nosc..

In the second round, according to
Lengyel, Bazemore punched Scott
-in the eye. In the third and final

‘round, Bazemore was knocked

down three times.

“There was no standing‘ eight
count after the third knock

down...the three knock down,r"‘i~---~

TKO (technical knock-out) rule had '
been waived before the fight,” said
Lengyel. The champ was ruled a
loser by TKO.

When asked if there will be a re-
match, Bazemore’s manager said,
“Yes, hopefully in September.”

Women '5 Studies Program
     Explores Feminist Iss ues

(Continued from page i)
said that the program places women
in a context they have never been
before. Through WSP courses,
women are able to examine in detail
such questions as: what they have
been taught, what they have read,

' and what they were brought up to

believe.

* Women’s studies core faculty
member, Dr. Ellen G. Detlefsen,
associate professor of library

I A science said that the WSP “serves

as a home” to all disciplines,
whether it be sociology, psychology
or the arts and sciences. In WSP,
students are brought together with
the common interest of researching
women’s topics, according to Dr.

Detlefsen. '

A distinctive aspect of the pro-
gram is that undergraduate and

‘ graduate students are encouraged to

work‘ with faculty in teaching
courses‘, and developing research
materials in new areas of "study.
More than 70 different women’s
studies courses have been developed
at Pitt in the last seven years. And,
according to Frieze, students‘ can
usually find a course to fit their
n€¢dS. whatever their area of in-
terest happens to be.’

A number of program options
available through WSP, according
/to the department are as follows:

—SeIf-Designed Major: “A stu-
dent in the College of "Arts and
Sciences can design an individualiz-
ed, multidisciplinary degree pro-

._ gram in women’s studies consisting

of a minimum of 36 credits of
academic work.” . .

—Cert1ficate: “Students in both
the College of Arts and Sciences
and the School of General Studies
can pursue a certificate in women’s
studies as a supplement to any ma-
jor consisting ‘of 18 credits of

’ academic work.”

--Independent Study: “Because
women’s studies is'a relatively new
acadernic- «field, opportunities for
innovative research are especially
challenging. Students are encour-
aged to do research on special
topics, bibliographies, and

resources in an independent study

course (usually equivalent to three
credits per term).”.
portunities are available to students
who wish to gain practical
knowledge" on the job at agencies
dealing with issues directly concern-
ing women.” ,
—Dz'stribution Credit and Elec-

' tives: “Most of our courses can be

used to fulfill requirements for
distribution credit; all can be elec-
tives.” .

There are benefits for students
enrolled in WSP courses. Students

-have indicated that courses meant

more as an intellectual experience

and that courses helped to fulfill

both their personal and practical
needs, according to Frieze and
Detlefsen.

WSP was formally instituted in
the fall of 1972 with the hiring of
three faculty members and a small
office staff. Dr. Cynthia
Sutherland was one of those
original ~members and she is cur-
rently serving as coordinator of the
program.

Excerpts from a five-year report
submitted by the department in-
dicate the growth and success of
WSP: “During our first five years,
we have been pleased with the
steady growth of the program in
spite of declines in‘ the general stu-
dent population and in the financial

‘resources of the university.

“We have increased the quality as
well as the number and variety of
courses we offer. Additionally, we
sponsor teaching seminars,
workshops, speakers, and films; in
gonjunction with the Women’s
Center we publish a newsletter of
general interest to women

throughout_ the university com:

9!

munity. . .

_‘Another important service of
the program is to aid graduate and
undergraduate students, staff,
faculty and f‘ people . from , the ' com-

lmunity in projects“ 'relating’to the

study of women and women’s
issues.
