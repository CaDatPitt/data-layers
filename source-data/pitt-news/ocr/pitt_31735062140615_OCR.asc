Coeds Will Receive
New Trophy At Sing

For the ﬁrst time in 14 years a
brand new loving cup will be
awarded the winner in the women’s
intper-class sing Wednesday at
12:30 o’clock in Foster memorial.

Every University ‘woman may
compete in the sing, sponsored an-
nually by the traditions committee
of WSGA. The sing this year is
under the direction of Bettie Ka-
lish, C43.

Skits must be not more than 12
minutes long, and will be judged
on the basis of originality,‘ clever-
ness, group singing, spirit and at-
lie-ndance.

Usually the cup, inscribed with
the names of winners, has been
presented to the winning class.

They in turn presented it to the,

next year's winner.

Seniors last year gained perma-
nent possession of the cup since
they received the trophy for the
third time in four years. They
were the ﬁrst class to be so hon-
ored since the inter—class sings
Loriginated, 14 years ago.

Although Marjorie Lowy, Ed40,
and her committee presented the
cup to the University after the
name of the class had been in-
scribed on the back, it still re-
mains nominally in their posses-
sion.

High Priest,” in which we find At-
lantis being destroyed by a tidal
wave. The hand of the high priest
grasps for a support but ﬁnds only
the emptiness of the air.

In the background the winged
Assyrian bull goes down with all
other symbols of the composite At-
lantian art and religion, While in
the sky “Ankh,” the symbol of the
negative and the positive in life,
ascends from the turbulent sea
which is to hide the lost world
and all its secrets until eternity.

The exhibition illustrates Dr.
Avinoff’s thesis that the subject
and problem involved in a work of
art directly governs the technique
and style in which it should be exe-
cuted. A good work of art, he be-
lieves, should be drawn to corre-
spond exactly to the subject, and
should not have the artist's own
ideas imposed on it.

In this group of water colors,
pastels, etchings, and pen and ink
drawings, the variety of techniques
and style is in direct proportion
to the comphehensive subject mat-
ter.

Believing that imagination must
be within the bonds of correct
craftsmanship, and that the me-
dium of expression must be under
complete control, Dr. Avinoﬂ‘ says
that poor drawing is unpardonable.
His own works are done skillfully
and with devotion, not with the
idea of merit or signiﬁcance.

Army lnducts Three
Students at University

Among several Pitt students who
have withdrawn from school since
September to join the army are
three students in the College.

Incomplete lists received today
include George Horanic, C42, in-
ducted September 15, and Carmen
Anton, C44, called September 13.
John Gobble, C43, was the third to
be inducted. He entered the army
on October 14. Edward Graber,
C45, has joined the Royal Can-
adian Air Force.

Additions to this list of men
who have been inducted or who
have volunteered are expected to
be announced this week.

At The Stanley

It’s “Music that Contrasts” this
week at the Stanley, with Jimmy
Dorsey, erstwhile “world’s great-
est saxophonist” offering most of
the music, while smooth Bob Eb-
erle and jiving Helen O'Connell
provide the contrasting rhythms.

For Dorsey, with the novel ar-
rangements he used on “Green
Eyes," “Amapola,” “In the Hush
of the Night,” "and “Time Was,”
features Eberle and Miss O'Con-
nell; balancing Bob's dreamy tem-
pos against Helen's sensuous syn-
copations in an altogether satisfy-
ing manner. .

Rounding out the entertainment
are Buddy Schultz, (he of the solid
downbeat) and his drums; Tip,
Tap, and Toe, novelty dancers, and
comedians Bob Evans and Jerry
O’Leary.

Back in the days when actors
wore togas and laurel wreaths, and
when audiences sat on the stone
seats of the amphitheaters, the
courtroom scene wa-s one of the

V oldest and certainly the most pow-

erful cliche of the theater.
Stephen Vincent Benet is no man

to overlook a cliche. He has given
the old idea a new twist. In “The
Devil and Daniel Webster,” Web-
ster is attorney for the defense, up-
holding money-mad m a n k i n d
against the prosecution of Scratch
(Satan, Lucifer, Pluto, Mephisto-
pheles).
At the Stanley this week, there
is playing a vaguely similar but

somewhat oversexed version of the 

original Benet piece. “All That

Money Can Buy” is the title of the

that they now look as fresh as a.
show on the way to its _ﬁrst Broad-
way unveiling. 

“Blossom Time" is the only pre-
sentation to play more repeat en-
gagements in Pittsburgh than
“The Student Prince.” The latter
production will be starting its thir-
teenth week in Pittsburgh when it
opens another return engagement
in the Nixon tonight. It first ap-
peared here on December 21,
1925, and remained for four weeks
at the old Alvin theatre. It. came
back later the same season to run
for three more weeks.

It was in the spring of 1926 that
“The Student Prince” played its
first “farewell engagement” at the
Alvin with DeWolf Hopper, that
old warhorse of operetta, in one
of the principal comic parts. A year
later, in February, 1927, the musi-
cal piece returned for another
week. I

Then followed a lapse of three I
years when the show was lost either

in the Dakota badland-s or in Cain's _.

warehouse. At any rate, it was
missing from the local scene for
that length of time.

At The Nixon

Back in 1924 and 1925 the
Messrs. Shubert, the most proliﬁc
theatrical producers of the period,

brought out two operettas which '-

have been ever since part of the
American theatre.
One of these musical pieces was

“Blossom Time.” The other was
“The Student Prince.” Except for

an odd season now and then, these 
have regularly

this ‘week a valuable collection of
photoprints of ancient Chinese
classics, history, philosophy, and
b_elles—letters, the gift of the Chi-
nese, government to Pitt.

__ Leland M. Baldwin, University li-
brarian,’ revealed today that the
collection was obtained through the
aid of the United States Embassy
in Chunking, China. ’

Entitled “The Ssu Ku Chuan
Shu,” the works were compiled be-
tween 1773 and 41782 under the
patronage of Emperor Ch’ien
Lung, and represents an attempt
to bring together all the works
known at the time which the the
‘compilers considered worthy of
pr.e.servation.

Those were the times when girls

King Discusses
Nutrition Values

Since, half the food consumed
“just doesn’t contain the minimum
required properties of food value,”
between 30 and 40 per cent of the
American population is under/noun
ished, Dr. Charles King, professor
of chemistry, told the Pennsylvania
State Dental society convention in
the William Penn hotel last week.

One-ﬁfth of the men called for
army duty in the draft were re-
jected because of fgulty teeth
which resulted from malnutrition,
he contended.

Reﬁned cereals, sugar, and fats,
which comprise half of the food
consumed -in this country as well
as other countries, have been found
to be devoid of the vitamins and
minerals necessary in a healthy
diet, Dr. King declared.

The convention was attended by
some 1,300 delegates.

Charles Lomas, director of men’s
debating, regretfully admitted that
there is no certain treatment and
self-assured persons do not always
make the best speeches.

In a series of tests with a group .
of high school students, Dr. Lomas
discovered that speakers who were
frightened before they began
speaking, but who became calm
once they started, were more ﬂuent
than the perfectly poised speakers.

Dr. Lomas contended that the
vigorous action helps little in “cur-
ing the patient.” He said that the
shifting of attention, taking of
deep breaths, handling objects, and
walking, may help master stage
fright, but detracts from the
speech.

Speakers who have an important
message for the audience can over-
come their stage fright and become
quite articulate when presenting it,

Gerber Studies

Advertisements

Stores spend far more for news-
paper ads than for radio advertis-
ing,» it was discovered in a survey
of”92 major city department stores,
by John A. Garber, instructor in
advertising of the Research Bu-
reau for Retail Training.

‘According to the survey ﬁgures
the average store uses 3.45 per
cent of its gross income in news-
papers and only .07 per cent in
radio for advertising purposes, a
ratio of almost 50 to one.

Of the 92’ stores in cities with
populations of from 50,000 to 100,-
000, exactly one-half bought no
radio time at all.

Mr. Garber’s survey of broad-
cast advertising, based on queries
in 13 states, confirms his state-
ment: “Radio still plays a rela-
tively unimportant part in depart-
ment store publicity activities.”

Student Poll
Shows War

In t
Sen ti en .5

Austin, Texas-, November 17.-
Adding further evidence to the ap-
parent fact that the nation’s stu-
dents do not favor intervention,
American student opinion today
maintains that college men should
be allowed to complete their edu-
cation before they are inducted into
the army. E

 

Results of the latest poll by Stu-
dent Opinion Surveys of America
show also that even if war should
be declared and an expeditionary
force sent out, nearly two-thirds
of the college men today say they
would wait their turn in the draft
rather than volunteer.

Interviewers asked a cross sec-
tion of collegians in a cooperative
poll from Oregon to Florida,
“Which of these statements most
nearly expresses your view on the
idea of deferring college students
from the draft?” Percentages of
the ‘answers given were-: ‘

Defer until education is com-
pleted—54 per _cent.

Defer only those being trained
in ﬁelds vital to defense-24 per
cent. ‘

Simply being a student is no
ground for deferment-——4 per cent.

Make students subject to draft
between high school and college-——,.«
12 per cent.

Something else-—5 per cent.
Undecided—-1 per cent.

Changing the neutrality law was
opposed by at least half of US
college students according to_ a
Survey report two weeks ago, and
nearly eight out of 10 considered
giving supplies to the allies more
important than joining the ﬁght.

Carlson Gives ,
Cagers Work,

,.  " Cl’? 6 In

With the opening of the current

season a little less than ﬁve weeks .
away, Dr. Carlson’s Blue and Gold."

ﬂoor squad has started scrimmag-
ing. Having ﬁnished preliminary
practices, the squad has now‘ reach-
ed the “ice cream” stage according
to Carlson.
Last Thursday night, the Pan-
ther squad scrimmaged with the
Duquesne Koprivers, a local semi-
pro outﬁt. After this workout Carl-
son announced that co-captains Ed
Ziolkowski and Larry Paffrath, and
Toy Mala:-ley were the ‘stand out
members of the squad at present.
Not far behind, in fact right on
the heels of these three, are Jimmy
Egan, Bobby Artman, Steve Shu-

her, and Johnny Swacus. Rounding ‘

out the squad are Steve Zernich,
Lloyd “Whitey” ‘Carlson, Red Sil-
verman, Ed Spartz, Walter Jones,
Paul Lohmeyer, Harry Mathews,
and Bob Alcorn.

In comparison with other big uni-
versities Carlson stated that this is
a small squad, and hoped that it
would be augmented soon by some
unknown stars, who have not re-
ported as yet. In other words, the
good doctor wants it known that
there is room for some more men
on the squad.

In spite of late classes, Carlson
is no longer having the trouble he
had earlier in the year in getting
the men out tothe workouts.

Freshman practice will begin in
earnest on December 1, with How-
ard Waite, trainer of the athletes,
in charge. Waite has had basket-
ball coaching experience at Colo-
rado university.

Some of the freshmen have al-
ready reported, and have been en-
gaging in light drills. For the time
being Waite requested that the men
reporting bring their own equip-
ment until the freshman drills get
underway oﬂicially. 1

itt Awaits Gun At IC4-A Meet.

‘Pictured above is Pitt's crack cross-country squad
that today meets the country’s best barriers in the
annual IC4-A meet at Van Cortland Park, New York.

Bill Curtis to Face Nation’s Best
Harriers at New York Meet

Coach Carl Olson's cross coun-
try pack have ﬁnished dieting and
will attempt to conquer greener
pastures as they head for New
York hoping to grab a slice of vic-
tory in the annual IC4-A meet this
afternoon at 2:30 o’clock.

The Panther has not come
through “in the money” since 1938
when it placed third in the meet.
Walter Sterner, that year, took
third running in a ﬁeld of 150 boys.

However, this year the outlook
for the local harriers is brighter,
due mostly to Bill Curtis. This Pan-
ther flash will be one of Coach
Olson's chief weapons against the
top-notch schools at New York
this afternoon.

When asked what he thought
about the chances of the Blue and
Gold thinclads Olson said, “Well,
we have a good shot at winning

this meet; better than we have had '

for a considerable time. Curtis will
hold his own against any of the
runners that the other schools will
ﬁre against us.”

Last week’s defeat of Curtis will
give the local boy something to
work on in showing Pitt fans that
it wasn’t an accident when he won
three previous meets. A glance at
the list of entries, indicates that he
will have to be at his best.

The course for the IC4-A cham-
pionship run is ﬁve miles, a dis-
tance that has not been traveled by
any member of the local hill and
dale aggregation, yet this season.

Beginning ﬁve miles out the race
ends in Van Cortland Park sta-
dium, the site of all past IC4-A
contests, situated at Broadway and
242nd Street in New York city.

Among the top-notch schools
sending representatives to the
IC4-A meet will be Navy,’C.C.N.Y.,
Harvard, Boston College, Yale,
Dartmouth, Columbia, Fordham,
Alfred, Rutgers, Cornell, Prince-
ton and Vermont.

N.Y.U., Penn State, Rhode ls-
land,e:rmy and Michigan State are
tagg as leading contenders.
Among these State, Army, and
Michigan State are foes that have
already been met by the locals.
But N.Y.U. gets the nod as the
team favored to win.‘

One big reason why the Violets
from N.Y.U. rate high, is Leslie
'MacMitchel1, one of the country’s
top cross-‘country men. The IC4-A,

will be after his third victory. If
he does win, it will be a feat equal-
ed only once in modern cross coun-
try history when John Paul Jones
carried Cornell’s colors to the wire
in 1910-12.

He will have another advantage
over the rest of the contestants

having been over the course this

year, in annexing his third straight
Metropolitan title. The N.Y.U.
harrier has yet to be defeated in
cross country competition this
year. Olson regards him as THE

Complete instructions were sent
to Coach Olson for the meet and
were issued to the boys before they
left last Friday. Numbers were also
sent and the IC4-A ofﬁcials sug-
gested that they be placed on the
jerseys. As a precautionary step,
so that the right course will be
used by contestants, a map of the
route was included.

pletion of the meet team prizes and

 Holbrook To Award Cup
For l-M Engineers Teams

For the ﬁrst time in the history
of intramural athletics at Pitt, the
athletes of the school of engineer-
ing will have an all-point cup of
their own._ Dean E. Allen Holbrook,
head of the school of engineering
and mines and the faculty, will
make the cup presentation, an an-
nual award, to the slide rule and
t-square athletes.

Dean Holbrook has been one of
' the most ardent
enthusiasts of in-
tramural athlet-
' ics on the Pitt
faculty. This is
one of the rea-
sons that prompt-
ed him to make
this award to
“his boys.”

The trophy, a
huge, gold affair,
 will be awarded
» in the same meth-

od as an interim-

 

HOLBROOK

ternity council trophy is given to
the outstanding fraternity on
campus. However, only points scor-
ed in athletic events will count,
while the I-F council cup is given
for scholarship and singing at the

, yuletide festival, as well as ath-
letics.

7," The Faculty All-Point Cup will
. symbolize supremacy of the engin-
eering league, and will remain in
the possession of the organization
winning it, for a year. Dean Hol-
brook will make the award next
spring, following the completion of
the intramural much-ball season.

The name of the team, and the
year that it was won will be en-

graved on the glittering award,
and will remain in the possession
of the winning aggregation until
the following spring, when it will
be given to the succeeding cham-
pions.

The award will be made an an-
nual affair, and thus willgive the

engineers the same incentive that 1

the Greeks have, to go “all out” to
win their intramural games.

Edgar “Special Delivery Jones stole a page out Of 3

Frank Mcrriwell novel last Saturday afternoon at Lincoln,
Nebraska, and perfectly enacted the hero’s part for he pulled
an enemy pass out of the air with only one minute left to play
and scampered 75 yards for a touchdown to give Pitt a 14-7
victory over the Nebraska Cornhuskers.

They say it only happensin books and in movies. Who

could believe that it would actually happen in real life? But _

it did, and 30,000 people stood amazed as this a1l—AmeriCan
performer changed the entire complexion of the football

game in less than one minute.

“As goes Jones goes the Pitt team” never proved to be
so true as it did last Saturday afternoon when the Scranton

   

Scooter was partially stopped H
ing the first half, but rallied‘ ‘
team to score twice in the ﬁnal 7
sion.

Fortunately for the Husker fans, ‘

Jones started the contest with an
injured shoulder and was not able

to pass, but the Mid-Western fans

could not ﬁnd any ﬂaw in his kick-
ing or running. Jones was at true
all-American. k

Statistics were all in favor of the
team from the Big Six conference,
but the touchdowns count, not the
ﬁrst downs. The Nebraska ' team
completely outplayed the Panther
aggregation throughout the first
and second periods as their varied
formations made the Jungle Cats
rather puzzled and amazed. At
times it was a “T” formation, then
again it was a double wing-back,
and maybe again it would be a sin-
'gle wing-back.

It started out as a sad day for
the Pitt fans when the supposedly
weak Nebraska eleven, outﬁtted

“with a brand ‘new “T” formation,

scored .a second period touchdown,
and seemed able to hold ‘their slim
lead.

But whatever coach Charlie Bow-
ser told them at the halftime must
have proven successful, for from
here on until the game's end, Pitt
was on the march.

it PM Eps Move into Final |—F Round
’After Trouncing Phi Deltsquad, 21-O

Strikinglwith a well coordinated
passing and running attack, Phi
Epsilon Pi overpowered Phi Delta
Theta 21-0 last Friday to advance
to the ﬁnal round of fraternity
football competition.

The Phi Delts had gained the
semi-ﬁnal round earlier in the week

,4.’ when they eliminated Phi Kappa
I 716. In the Phi Kappa contest the
Phi Delts sprung a surprise as the
passing combine of Nosser to An-
drews reversed to score the touch-
down. Andrews also passed to Sell
for the game-winning seventh
point.
This deadly paséing weapon of
_ the Phi Delts failed in the Phi Ep-
5 ‘ti silon Pi game, as an alert Phi Ep
secondary either knocked down or
ii" intercepted most of Nossek’s
throws.
Jimmy Deutelbaum was the big
0 gun in the Phi Ep attack, as he
passed for one touchdown, ran for
another, and kicked a 12-yard
ﬁeld goal.

The half was nearly over when
Deutlebaum whipped a short pass
to Goleman for the ﬁrst score. The
conversation failed, and the half
closed, 6-0, in favor of the Phi Eps.

“Figgy” Dutch intercepted a Phi
Delt pass early in the-second half
and ran to the four-yard line, to
put the Phi Eps in scoring position
again. Deutlebaum immediately
turned left end on the ﬁrst play to

push the score to 12-0.

A few minute-s later as the Phi

Ep attack stalled, Deutlemaum
stepped back to the 12 yard line
and drop-kicked a ﬁeld goal.

With time running ‘out the’ Phi
Delts tried a desperate passing at-
tack, only to lose the ball in the
shadow of their own goal line, on
downs. The Phi Eps took over
again and the ﬁnal tally was added
as Jay Silverberg ran the ball over
on the ﬁrst play.

Action on the intramural foot-
ball front reaches its peak today
with the beginning of the semi-
ﬁnal and ﬁnal playoffs in all three
loops. All of these games should be
good contests because the outcome
means a chance to play for the
league crown.

In the engineering league, the

Civil A’s take on the AE&ME'

frosh and sophs, both of whom have
been beaten once this season. The

Civil A’s lost their game as a re-"

sult of a forfeit, while the'AE&
ME’s met defeat at the hands of
the senior AE&ME outﬁt.

The Greek league feature ﬁnds
undefeated Pi Kappa Alpha bat-
tling the Phi Eps winners of Fri-
day’s semi-ﬁnal playoff with the Phi
Delts. Led by the Wilde brothers,
Gus and Ralph, “Chuck” Page, and
Dick Fair, the PiKA’s have been
the surprise of the league and have
thoroughly trounced all of oppo-
sition thus far.

The independent circuit has only
reached the quarter-ﬁnals, but will
reach the semi-ﬁnal stage tomor-

Wayne Sindt started the trouble
-in the second period with I A 25
yard run around the Pitt right end
up to the 42-yard line. From here
on in, it was easy_——with Bradley
carrying most of the load and fin-
ally sweeping around Pitt’: right»
end for the touchdown. Vic
Schleich tacked on the extra point
and the Nebraska hopes of break-
ing their 4 game losing streak
were bright indeed‘. '

In the following quarter, it wa-s
the courageous Pitt linemen that
stood out as they rose to great
heights when they stopped the
Cornhusker 77 yard march on the
Pitt three yard line. Bill Beng-
hauser, George Allshouse, Bill Dil-
on, Ralph Fife, and Stanley Ger-
velis played heads-upball through-
out this period.

On this sustained‘ drive, the
Huskers used everything in the
book except the cover when they
ran the outmoded Statue of Lib-
erty play, shovel passes, laterals,
and avguard around play to the
complete amazement of the people
and the Pitt gridders as well.

Then came the ﬁnal quarter.
