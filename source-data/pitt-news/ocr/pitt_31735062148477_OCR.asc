Survey Shows
Students Back
Loan to Finns

Western Collegians
Reﬂect Interest Lag
In European Affairs

By Student Opinion Surveys

AUSTIN, TEX., Feb. 21——-Al-
though college students have often
shown an emphatic desire to keep
the United States neutral, a nation-
wide poll recently completed re-
veals that sympathy for Finland is
great enough for a majority oi
them to approve of a form of Amer-
ican loan to the only nation that has
kept up its war debt payments.

Speciﬁcally, 62 per cent of the
collegians polled answered “yes” to
the question, “Should Congress al-
low Finland to draw on her latest
World war payment to the United
States?”

This study of sentiment in the
American college world is one of
the weekly polls conducted for the
Pitt News and scores of other un-
dergraduate newspapers that form
the Student Opinion Surveys of
America.

Favorable sentiment’ was found
in all parts of the country .on this
proposal "that President Roosevelt
made recently, and controversy over
the type of aid this country should
give Finland has already ﬂared in
Congress.

New England students are the
most in favor of the proposal, more
than seven out of every ten approv-
ing, while those in the Far West are
the least convinced.

An interesting fact brought out by
the Surveys in this an.d many other
polls on the international questions
has been that people in colleges on
the eastern coasts are usually more
interested in the part the United
States should play in the solution
of Europe’s troubles. As one goes
West, interest wanes’,-was the result
of the present poll shows:

Should We Allow Finland To

Use Her War Debt Payment?

Yes No
New England . . . . . . . . 372% 28%

Middle Atlantic . . . . . . .62 38

East Central . . . . . . . . . .60 40

West Central . . . . . . . . .64 36

South . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .64 36

Far VVest . . . . . . . . . . . . .54 46

United States Total. . . .62 38

This survey stands out in sharp
contrast to student opinion last Oc-
tober, when a majority differed with
national public opinion in opposing
change in the neutrality law in
favor of cash and carry.

Instructor Praises
Cap, Gown Dancers

Coincident with the closing of
the three-day registration period for
all Cap and Gown applicants, can,-
didates for east and chorus posi-
tions in the 1940 revue will begin
the first in a series of four dan.ce
training sessions this afternoon, ac-
cording to Miss Ruth Miller, dance
director.

Four o’clock today will be the
deadline for University students to
sign up for either the cast, chorus,
publicity, choral, business, or pro-
duction staffs in the Cap and Gown
oﬂice, 828 Cathedral, Robert Crooks,
production manager has announced.

Cast and chorus candidates who
have had no previous experience in
recent. C&G productions are re-
quired to attend at least two of the
four dance training sessions being
staged under the direction of Miss
Miller, dance director of the show.
Practices will be held today from
3 to 5 o’clock and from 7:30 to 9:30
o’clock; Friday from 3 to 5 o’clock;
and Monday from 3:45 to 5:30
o’clock; all in 315 Alumni Hall.

New candidates who have attend-
ed two training sessions and former
members of the cast and chorus will
be eligible to tryouts for cast posi-
tions Friday at 2:30 o’clock in 232
Cathedral under the supervision of
Miss Miller and Martin B. Fallon,
general director. Chorus elimina-
tions and ﬁnal selections of candi-
dates will begin on Tuesday, Feb-
ruary 27, in Alumni Hall.

“I feel quite ﬂattered serving as
dance director of Cap and Gown
the second year,” declared Miss
Miller today about her recent ap-
pointment. “I was rather dubious
when I took the position last year
because I was a little afraid that
a woman couldn’t get the same co-
operation as a man. However, I
had no difficulty. All the boys
were respectful, cooperative, and
real gentlemen.”

“With the one year of experience
working with boys, I believe we can
produce a show this year that the
school and Pittsburgh will be proud
of. I am indeed glad we have so
many of last year’s dancers out for
the new show.”

Copies of Fraternity Insignias
To Decorate Ballroom for I-F

Fraternity men are giving their
pins away Friday evening, only it
won’t be the girls who will be pin-
ned, but rather the mirrored walls
of the Hotel Schenley ballroom,
scene of the Interfraternity Ball
Friday evening.

Huge replicas of the insignia of
the men’s social fraternities on the
campus will be mounted in the ball-
room as the chief decorations for
the dance and as meeting places for
the members of the fraternities.

White ﬂowers will surround those
pins that have pearls on them, and
other pins with ruby stones will be
encircled by red ﬂowers. Although
the kind of ﬂowers has n.ot been
deﬁnitely decided upon yet, Joe
McCormick, BA40, Delta Tau Delta,
who is in charge of decorations, an-
nounced that they would probably
be red and white carnations. Frank
Kristufek, C40, is helping McCor-
mick make the replicas of the pins.

Beneath each pin will be a brief
history highlighting the particular
accomplishments of the fraternity
represented. Between dances then,
fraternity men will have no trouble

finding their brothers.

In the center of the ballroom will
be an even large imitation of the
Interfraternity key. After the
dance is over, each fraternity may
take its pin to use as a decoration
in the chapter’s quarters.

Following the theme of novelty
will be Richard Himber, red-headed
bandleader, who is bringing" his
original “rhythmic pyramids” dance
style that is world famous. Miriam
Shaw, song stylist, will be featured
with the orchestra.

Tickets are priced at $3.50 a cou-
ple, announces Al Eger, BA40, Pi
Lambda Phi, general chairman.
Dress is formal.

sert, Ed40, president.

 

Dr. Carlson
Makes Chart
For Health

Basketball Mentor
Presents 100 Points
To Assist Students

By Bob Graham

Teaching of health has been
too general for too long a t.i1nc;"
and if teachers of health and
physical education were to stress
fundamentals the way in which
the athletic coach does, the knowl-
edge of health as well as the health
of students would be better.

That is the opinion of Dr. H. C.
Carlson, director of the Men’s Stu-
dent Health Service and coach of
the varsity basketball team.

To prove his point, Dr. Carlson,
after two years of study, has devot-
ed a personal health estimation
chart which, stressing non-technical ‘
fundamentals, is being used by the
Student Health Service.

The personal health estimation
chart gives the student opportunity
to check 100 fundamentals of health
so that a complete picture of the
health status, both functional and
pathogenic, may be had.

Under functional fundamentals
Dr. Carlson lists certain physical,
mental, and social criteria. Under
pathogenic he classiﬁes his funda-
mentals as: physical systems, sup-
plemental, causes, emotional, and
pathogenical.

Physical health, on the functional
side, is divided into 12 fundament-
als: action, rest, food, elimination,
eating, air, heat, light, reserves,
growth, cleanliness, and posture.

In corresponding fashion, mental
health, on the functional side, has
12 fundamentals: action, rest, fac-
ing realities, elimination of negative

factors, — conquering . difficulties, ~
normal responses to feeling, person-
ality, understanding, reserves,

growth, cleanliness, and attitude.

It Sminks

Meaning Pitt Panther
Will S-ink and Sm - - -

We always thought the Pitt
Panther stunk, but this time it’s
out loud.

Knowing Jack Hoeveler’s predi-
lection (some have called it fancy)
for ﬂowers (for instance Four
Roses), readers, or sniffers as the
case may be, will not be surprised
to smell the reek of gardenias
about the Panther salesmen. For
the Panther comes out today with
its ink diluted with ashes of gar-
denia.

Of course few of us buy the
Panther to read it; we only want
to smell it. And so it isn’t im-
portant that the “‘Women’s” issue
will have three pages of photos of
“guys Pitt gals like to date”; Frank
Miller’s investigation called “Girls
I Have Known Go Steady”; and a
little fantastic tripe by Bob Ges-
trich.

P. U. The Panther’s out!

SFA to Begin

Poll on Spring

Festival Today

Statistics Committee '

Seeks Helpful Hints
From Student Body

If you think Spring Festival
VVeek needs some popping up, if
you think Sally Rand might be
a profitable Carnival Night at-
traction, or if you think the
Senior Ball might well be turned
into a tea dance at a dime a dance—--
in brief, if you have any kick com-
ing on the handling of past Spring
Festivals, now’s the time to speak
your piece.

Opening a poll of representative
student opinion this morning, the
SFA statistics committee is asking
some 500 undergraduates, chosen as
a cross-section of student life, what
they thought about the traditional
Spring Festival Week’s varied
events. Spring Festival this year
is scheduled for the week of May 6.
Roger Powell, E41, chairman of the
statistics committee, explained
Monday that although past festival
weeks have not been unsuccessful
as a whole, a larger percentage of
students should take part in the
festival events. ~

Improve Festival Week

Theodore W. Biddle, assistant
dean of men, ampliﬁed this state-
ment by explaining that the Stu-
den Faculty committee through the
student opinion poll is seeking “not
only to improve Spring Festival
week generally, but in particular to
give students what they like” dur-

ing the week-long program of,
events.
As student canvassers began

sampling opinion this morning, it;
was recalled that last year for the-,
first time Spring Festival was ex-
tended into an entire week devoted
to sporting, social and traditional
events.

First of seven questions tiat are
being asked of students is: “Do you
think Carnival Night should be held
in (a) Lilly Court, (b) Trees field,
or (c) Ruskin ﬁeld (involving a
rental), .

Other question appearing on the
poll seek to ﬁnd student opinion
concerning the desirability of a
paid carnival performance during
the week, and the advisability of
scrapping one or more of the follow-
ing events for a new festival fea-
ture: Senior Ball, Carnival Night,
Interfraternity Sweepstakes, Float
and ROTC parades, and Pitt Play-
ers play. ‘
Stag Banquet

University men are being asked
whether they would “support a
stag banquet if the tickets were
$1.50” during Festival Week.

In announcing the festival poll,
Powell stated that freshmen a.nd
transfer students will not be in-
cluded in the survey. Schools to be
canvassed include the College and
the Schools of Business Administra-
tion, Engineering, and Mines.

The SFA statistics committee in-
cludes Gertrude Forman, .Ed41;
Betty Cerra, Ed40; Fred Roth, Ed41;
Genevieve Gowaty, C42; Bill'Mc-
Elwain, C41; Edwin Ginder, E40;
Ted Starzynski, C40; Lillian Clark,
C40; Louis Singer, C41; Roswell
Yingling, C41; Lewis Lovell, C41;
Ralph Nadler, C42; and Charles

If it Is Peace
That We \Van

There has been much sound and fury over the way to keep the
United States out of war. Isolationist and believer in collective se-
curity have belabored each other; Coughlin. and Hearst have become
bedfellows of the Communists; politicians have become believers in
a big army, big navy and big economizing; and everything writ-
ten about the wars has had an accusing finger pointed at it, accom-
panied by a mass chant of “propaganda” as though to exorcise
some devil. It has all been one confused protest against Amer-
ican involvement in VVAR.

The college campus has furnished its share of the noise. The
beginning of the fall term found dozens, probably hundreds of anti-
VVAR groups or campaigns being started. Almost every editor of a
college publication devoted some space to portraying the horrors of
VVAR. Three huge anti-WAR leagues were formed and are now
dying quietly somewhere in their headquarters. The old groups
who had concerned themselves with peace before the present Euro-
pan war either have gone along with the new shouting, or have
concentrated on the internal problems of the United States to prove
that this country’s dangers come from within, and not from over the
sea. But in the main, the college campi over the country are all
concerned wit.h IVAR; for the young men are remembering that it
is they who have to die in the mud.

Now we shall be asked why we print the word “WAR” in
capital letters. Because that is the kind of war that we mean
everyone is denouncing; VVAR with capital letters, VVAR that is
hated in the same way that everyone hates sin, dope, and degenera-
tion and loves God, home, mother and country. IVAR, a glittering
generality that has blinded all its haters.

For there really isn’t’ so much hate of war in this country. The
true paciﬁsts are few. The half-million or so of them have stated
their position: “VVe will not ﬁght under any circumstances.” The
pv-osition of the rest of those who oppose war is that they ’d rather
not ﬁght. “VVe’ll ﬁght if we have to, but we’d rather not bother.”

The fact that war is a solution to a problem seems to have
escaped the non-paciﬁst war—haters. It is never a question of war
or no war, but a question of war or something else. It is a question
of how the markets of the world are to be divided, by war or by
something else; it is a question of how expanding populations are to
be given room, by war or by something else. It is a question as
to how to stop strong nations from invading weaker ones, by war
or by something else.

Therefore the non-palciﬁst war hater must decide now about his
answer if a crisis should come, war or an alternative. The choice
should be the alternative. For no matter how bad a peaceful solu-
tion is, war is worse.

'1'. Di.’ Gets a Fresh Idea
For News and ﬂpinion

New York City will have a new tabloid afternoon newspaper
this year. The new publication, to be known as “P. M.,” will con-
tain many revolutionary changes from current newspaper practice.

The front page of the new paper will be all headlines. Ar-
ticles in P. M. will be departmentalized in Time style. Pictures and
cartoons will be in color. These innovations will be introduced be-
cause the publisher is aiming for a carefully-planned newspaper to
meet the needs of today’s reader.

Another new plan which. the new paper will adopt is the elimin-
ation of the editorial page as it is found in most newspapers. In-
stead of the usual lengthy columns of editorial comments, the new
editorial page will feature a cartoon in color and letters from
readers. The editors of P. M. will make an effort to get good letters,
not ordinary "letters-to-the-editor” material.

This new proposal by the editors of P. M. has caused us to give
a little thought to our own editorial page. VVe can’t consider car-
toons in color, because we have a budget to meet. But we should
"receive more material from students and faculty members of the
"University.

The Pitt News should serve -as a medium for the expression of
the thought and opinion of University students and faculty. Com-
ments on student affairs, opinions on political and social trends,
notes on advances i.n science and education——these things are wel-
come in the News.

The News has always been open to the letters and other con-
tributions of University students and faculty members. The Pitt
News is not a closed corporation, available only to the regular staff.

So if you have something to say, let us know about it. \Ve’re
anxious to find out what Pitt students and faculty think, and glad to
publish your opinions.

Logic Is Great Stuff!

 Said Dr. Salem Bland, speaking at the University of Toronto’s
Hart House: “\Ve "should consider war, not as we feel it to be,
but as it really is. We must not attempt to evaluate war quanti-
tatively, for its mass sorrows are divided, and thus borne more
readily.

“Vile must bear in. mind that war is not something diabolical
and foreign to the Universe, which must be summarily abolished.
It is perfectly in harmony with the rest of the world, for it was
created by the same God who made famines, earthqjuakes, and
pestilences. I questionwlietlier we are ready to reject war.”

‘Ne wondered how long it would take them to start’ that all
over again. ’sychologists call it rationalizing.

Cold Awaits Energetic Student
At End of Contest Rainbow

By Freda Jaffe

If you are searching for a de luxe
trip, golden shekels, or merely a
consolation prize, there are no end
of contests open to ambitious col-
legians.

Confucius, that oriental gentle-
man recently swept into popular
favor, says that if you do attend a
college, you may win as much as
$100 for placing some words in his
mouth. The said words must gen-
eralize about the Saturday Evening
P0st’s leadership as a magazine.
Campus Confucious

Some 167 cash prizes total $750;
but for those disappointed entrants
who do not win cash, there are 500
honorable mention “Campus Con-
fucius” diplomas. There are di-
plomas and there are diplomas.

Stressing not a Chinese philos-
opher, nor even an American maga-
zine, the Korusai Bunka Shinkokai
is oﬁerlng several travel awards to
Japan for essays on the culture of
that country. Not restricted to col-
lege students, the contest is open to
the subject of any country except
Japan. Manuscripts must not ex-
ceed 8,000 words.

Taylor Judges

Five ﬁr'st prizes consist of a first
class round trip and a three months’
stay in Japan; then second prizes
include round trips and a one
month’s stay in Japan.

If you can’t think of a new Con-
fucianism and if you won’t write an
essay, Pomona college is offering
cash prizes, ranging from $50 to
several merchandise awards, for a
one—act play. Manuscripts are due
by April 15. Robert Taylor, screen
hero to the feminine cinema fans
and an alumnus of Pomona, has of-
fered to “look over” the winning
manuscripts for screen possibilities.

Two other awards for literary
work are being offered for college
youth. Kaufmann’s department
store is awarding, in conjunction
with a publishing house, a prize for
a novel on American youth. The
entries must be postmarked no later
than May 1.

The New Republic, in a contest
which closes on March 15, is spon-
soring a contest for essays on any
subject suitable for magazine pub-
lication. ‘

All of the above contests require

writing of some sort. But Para-
mount studios is sponsoring a con-
test to select a talented (and no
doubt beautiful) coed.

Sidelines

With Bill McElwain
Sports Editor

Editor’s Note: This is the first of a series of articles about the Big
Ten, its history, organization, and its relation to the University of Pitts-
burgh.

Probably more discussed on the University campus than any
other single topic in recent months has been the question of the
University ’s relationship with the Big Ten.

Yet, when someone asks, “VVhat is the Big Ten? \Vhat would
it mean if Pitt were a member‘.?”, almost no one is qualiﬁed to
answer.

For, despite wide-spread publicity, the Big Ten is little more
than a name to the average University student or to the man on
the street. The general conception is that of a collegiate football
league which year after year turns out several of the nation’s finest
teams.

This conception is entirely out of line with the purpose of the
group which, incidentally, is not the Big Ten nor even the \Vestern
Conference but the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Repre-
sentatives. The name “Big Ten” is one of newspaper usage, and

the conference has set no limit upon the number of schools in its
membership.

At present, the conference consists of faculty representatives
from Indiana, Chicago, Ohio State, Northwestern, Michigan, Illi-
nois, Minnesota, Purdue, Iowa, and VVisconsin. From each school
comes one faculty man, whose chief interest at his university is not
athletics. Neither coaches nor athletic directors may be members
of the board.

Stresses Faculty Control

The conference is a legislative and executive body operating on
the principle that college athletics should come directly under fac-
ulty control and that they do not constitute a. specially privileged
division of the school. In no sense is the conference a playing
league, nor does it fundamentally place more emphasis on football
than on any other sport.

Long a champion of amateur college sports, the conference in-
sists on strict application of rules guarding against professional
play. No conference athlete may receive unearned ﬁnancial aid
which is intended to further “the athletic fortunes of the recipient
or of the institution in which he is enrolled.”

Recruiting of players and “try-outs” are illegal under confer-
ence regulations. The athletic “talent scout” is thus eliminated
as are all other similar oﬁices found frequently in various colleges
of the country. However, employees of a. school’s athletic depart-
ment may attempt to persuade a boy to enter their school if he
visits them at the school. The persuading does not include special
inducements or “offers.”

Severe Penalties For Rule Breakers

Should a member college violate conference rules, the penalties
-are severe. A school which persists in breaking regulations may be
dropped. from the conference, and future athletic relations between
the oﬁending school and conference schools are forbidden. Indi-
vidual athletes must conform to the rules on penalty of loss of
eligibility.

If the athletic director of a conference school feels that an
athlete of another conference school is violating regulations, the
complaint is sent to the office of the conference Commissioner of
Athletics who in turn asks the athletic director of the offending
school to investigate and report on the case.

Wlhen the report is completed, it is returned to the Commis-
sioner who sends it to the school making the charge. Usually the
matter is thus straightened out, but if the report does not meet
with the complete approval of the complainant and the Commis-
sioner, an investigation may be conducted by the Commissioner’s
office.‘ (Contrary to frequent allegations by sports writers, this
office does not maintain a “spy service” to check up on members.)

The results are placed before the faculty council of the confer-
ence, and these ten faculty men, not the Commissioner, make the
ﬁnal decision, as. they do in all cases arising within the conference.

Fraternity Teams Face Heavy

Schedule Today in All Sports

In an eﬁort to complete the ma-
jority of the interfraternity races
before Friday’s cup presentations at
the I-F ball, today’s schedule is one

Kappa Sigma, and the Phi Gams
are bunched at the top of the
league which should make the win-
ner victorious only by a photo-

of the heaviest played this season.

In all phases of the winter intra-
mural sports program, the battle for
the league lead is close. Basketball,
the dominant sport, draws more in-
terest and has the closest race. The
frat standings are almost at a stand-
still as Theta Chi, and the Phi Gams
continue to remain only one game
behind the league leading Phi Kap-
pa quintet. '

The Phi Kaps, last year’s champ-
ions, must yet play the Fiji team.
The Phi Kaps boast an all—around
team made up of Cassiano, Good-
ell, Herron, Glenn, and Halloran.
The Phi Gams show high scoring
Bill Edmunds and Bobby Thurbon.

Today’s schedule will be featur-
ed by the Kappa Sig--PiKA and
Delta Tau Delta-Phi Epsilon Pi
games. These teams are closely
matched and victory would assure
any of them a higher position in the
race.

In volleyball, Delta Tau Delta,

ﬁnish. Today’s match between the
Delts and the Kappa Sigs should
make a decided difference in the
league standings, The PiKA-Phi
Kap game should also prove to be a
thriller. ,

Table tennis appears to be the
only sport in which one team mo-
nopolizes, and the Delts have gar-
nered that honor. Only seven loss-
es for this season is the record that
they boast. Cannon, Kennedy,
Kramer, and Hawkins make up the
team.

No bowling is scheduled today,
but the PiKA keglers are leading
the ﬁeld with the Phi Gums, and Pi
Lams close behind.

Handball, a sport that is rapidly
gaining favor in the University, is
scheduled for only one game today,
and that will pit the SAM team
against the Fijis. In the league’s
top spot are the Kappa Sig hand-
ballers with Lambda Chi their only
serious challenger.

WAA Sextet
To Meet Rival

Engineering Collegians

Cage Title

Croker Leads Victory
Over AEME, 16-14,
In Tough Game

In one of the most thrilling
games played on the Trees Gym
ﬂoor this season, the undefeated
Oil & Gas team cinched the en-
gineering title Monday night by
nosing out their leading chal-
lenger, the AE&ME quintet, by
a score of 16-14.

The game ran true to form as
the brilliant defenses of both teams
functioned at their peak. The
AE&ME team was held to one ﬁeld
goal as the victor’s garnered four.

Dunbar High Scorer

High scoring Dunbar of the
AE&ME team held scoring honors
with nine points. For the winning
team, Croker, veteran star and
sparkplug of the Oilers, had six.

The Oilers were pre-game
favorites because of their mark of
five consecutive victories as com-
pared to the AE&ME team’s scanty
three.

In the only handball game played
Monday, the Kappa Sigma team
whitewashed the Lambda Chi team
3-0, to boost their championship
hopes.

Volleyball was played by the
PiKA team and the Delts. The
PiKA spikers won over their rivals
3-0. This defeat dropped the Delts
from their top position in the race.
Bowling Results

Complete routs were registered in
all except one of the bowling
matches scheduled for Friday in the
intramural league.

The Theta Chi and Sigma Chi
rollers provided the only real com-
petition in a match that saw the
Theta Chis topping the Sigma
Chis 2-1.

In the other games the winners
all turned in clean sweeps over
their fraternal opponents.’

Phi Gamma Delta took three out
of three from the SA M bowlers
while the Pi Kappa Alpha won over
the Phi Kaps 3-0.

Delts Top SAE

The Delta Tau Delta squad con-
tinued to top the duck pin race
when they defeated their S A E foe,
also by a 3-0 count.

‘Lambda Chi Alpha fell before the
Kappa Sigs and the Phi Eps dropped
their encounter to Phi Delta Theta,
both scores being 3-0.

In the volleyball games played
Saturday on the Trees Gym court
the high ﬂying Delts trimmed the
Phi Kaps 3-0 to keep their athletic
standing on its high plane.

Other frays found the Phi Gams
taking over the S A M, 3-0, and Phi
Delta Theta winning over the Kap-
pa Sigs by taking three straight
matches.

Fencing Club

The Personal Ads are good for
something, for they located the
Fencer‘s Club in the University.

A group of amateur fencers meet
each Monday evening in the Cathe-
dral Gym and practice under the
direction of Richard G. Montgom-
ery, assistant custodian of supplies
in the department of chemistry,
and a member of the Fencer’s Club
of Pittsburgh. The University club
has 16 members, of whom three are
girls. President is Jesse Huff, C40.

This year’s schedule will proba-
bly include engagements with fenc-
ing clubs from Duquesne university
and Carnegie Tech.

Potts Announces
Added Intramural
Bowling Matches

Despite the fact that intramural
league bowling competition has end-
ed, the interest in i.t has not waned;
consequently, the intramural ofﬁce
has arranged for open bowling com-
petition to take place in the lull be-
tween the Winter and Spring pro-
grams.

This added recreation will have
no bearing on the all-point trophy
or the int-erfraternity cup. The ob-
ject is to provide additional action in
response to the demand for it.

Teams to be entered in the tourn-
ament, a double elimination affair,
will be represented by four men
and two alternates. Fraternities
and groups may enter more than
one team.

Actual action is to get underway
February 28, necessitating the ﬁling
of entrance blanks by February 26.
The first schedule will be run in
the News, but further schedule in-
formation will come from the Trees
Gym oﬁice.

Center and Neville and Strand
alleys will again be the scenes of
the tournament, with 4:30 o’clock
set up arbitrarily as the starting
time.

The history of women’s basket-
ball at the University will take a
new turn this season with the be-
ginning of intercollegiate contests.
Never before have University W0-
men engaged in games With other
colleges, since Pittsburgh colleges
have not had organized women’s
basketball teams.

This season, according to Flor-
ence Ragan, Ed40, chairman of
WAA basketball, Carnegie Tech,
PCW, Mt. Mercy, and Duquesne
will participate in intercollegiate
women’s basketball, and will ar-
range a schedule of games with
the University.

Tryouts are being held this aft-
ernoon at 4:30 o’clock for the var-
sity team, and all women who are
interested may report to the Ca-
thedral gym at that time.

In the first game of the season,
University women will compete to-
morrow evening with an indepen-
dent team at the downtown post

of the Salvation Army. The game
will begin at 7:45 o’clock.

. Probable line-up for this game
includes: Grace Richards, Ed40;

-Lila Klein, Ed40; Joy Hartman,

Edalo; Kay Beatty, Ed40; Annabelle
Miller, Ed40; and Florence Ragan.
According to Miss Ragan, there
will be intramural games later in
the season to determine the class
championship of the University.

Tankers Stop
Temple, 52-23

Six pool records and three meet
marks were shattered as Pitt’s mer-
men tamed the Temple Owls to the
tune of 52-23 last Friday night at
Philadelphia.

Temple’s 300-yard medley relay
team and Steingas, Temple’s star
100-yard free-style swimmer, help-
ed the Owls share in the record
breaking spree.

Joe Orloff in the 50-yard free-
style and Milt Lederstein in the 220-
yard free-style together with Al
Beacon in the 150-yard backstroke
and Herb Cosgrove in the 200-yard
breaststroke, made up the quartet
of Panther swimmers who set new
pool records.

Franklin and Marshall, Pitt’s next
swimming opponent, will not prove
so easy for coach Grady’s boys as
the Templers.

Jack Miller, Eastern Collegiate
100-yard free-style champion will
be with the Diplomat splashers
when they come to town next Fri-
day. The Panthers will miss the
services of Al Beacon for this meet
because of his temporary ineligi-_
bility.

For fans who like closely contest-
ed battles, the Franklin and Mar-
shall meet will be one that shouldn’t
be missed. Coach Grady insists
“The score will be so close that I
wouldn’t dare pick the winner.”

Kristufek Accepts A
All-Star Invitation

Frank Kristufek, C40, varsity left
tackle on the 1939 Pitt football
team, has accepted an invitation to
play in the New York Giants-
Eastern All Stars charity game at
the Polo grounds next September.

Kristufek is the third member
of Charley Bowser’s squad, to re-
ceive an invitation, the others Ben
Kish and Dick Cassiano. Last
year nine Panthers were in the
starting lineup of the all star team,
chosen by promoters Stanley
Woodward of the New York World
Telegram.

The college boys have never
beaten the professional team since
the series began.

Registrar’s Oﬂice
Reinstatcs Scherer

Jack Scherer, senior member of
Dr. H. C. Carlson’s “what can we
lose” basketball team, was declar-
ed eligible again Monday by the
registrar’s ofﬁce and was able to
compete against West Virginia last
night.

Originally included on the list
of victims of scholastic ineligibility,
Scherer was able to make up in-
completes in several courses.

Trackers Run Saturday
In I ntra-Sq uad Games

Carter, Stichel Threaten 0hl’s Sprint Record
After Fine Showing in NYAC Dash Events

Rapidly approaching peak form,
Pitt track men look forward to the
eighth annual University indoor
championship Saturday afternoon
at the trackhouse.

As a result of some surprising
performances at Madison Square
garden, local track fans will have
an opportunity to witness one of the
greatest intra-squad sprinting duels
in the meet’s annals. In both the
50-yard dash and two lap dash,
sophomores Bullet Bill Carter and
Hap Stickel threaten to dethrone
defending titlist Frank Ohl.

Carter Runs Third

Last Saturday night, incompeti-
tion with the outstanding dash men
of the nation, Carter wound up in
third place in the NYAC 60-yard
dash. Only Mose Ellerbe, national
champ from Tuskegee institute, and
Eulace Peacock, former Temple
star, outdistanced him. In a trial
heat Carter equaled both the NYAC
record and the winning time in the
ﬁnals of 6.2 seconds.

Stickel, also in his ﬁrst big time
sprinting start, gained the semi-
ﬁnals, and whipped Ben Johnson on
the way up. When this duo crouches
at the mark Saturday, veterans Ohl
and Larry Tregonning must give
way or make top performances to
ﬁnish in the one-two positions: they
held last year. Both Dick Mason’s
5.4 second 50-yard standard and
Oh1’s 33 second two-lap dash mark
are in jeopardy.

Graf Replaces Woodruﬁ

Anchor man on the mile relay
team that took second last Saturday
night, Bud Graf, junior star, makes
his initial indoor half-mile start
Saturday afternoon. Winner of the
junior AMA 880—yard title last sum-
mer, Graf is looked upon to remove
at least some of the furrows Johnny
Woodruff’s graduation left in coach
Carl Olson’s brow. V

Al McKee, another member of the
relay quartette, will help push Graf
Saturday. Also entered in the four
furlong test are Tom Allen, the

junior with Woodrutf-like stride,

and sophomores Jim Saunders and
Ben Foote. Graf is the lone con-
tender likely to near Long John’s
ﬁgures of two minutes, three sec-
onds

In addition to A1 Boulanger, rec-
ord—bound distance star, Frank Mc-
Cabe, Warren Roseborough, and
Bob Graham will battle for places
in the mile and two mile event. The
mile mark of 4:30 will probably es-
cape unscathed, but the old two-
mile standard of 9:5l.9 will prob-
ably be erased.

Kiess Explains
Hitler’s Aims
In Forum Talk

German Exile Says
Fuehrer Left People
‘Only Ration Cards’

“Hitler ate the German cake
piece by piece until t.he Germans
now have only ration cards,”
said Dr. Paul C. Kiess, in eulogiz-
ing the Naziﬁcation of the Ger-
man spirit, at Monday’s Inquiry
Forum.

Describing the degeneration of
German social life through the in-
ﬁltration of the New German Creed
——the Hitler religion based on Ary-
anism and the Nordic blood——Dr.
Kiess related his own dilﬁculty ex-
periences at the hands of the Nazis.

With his thick shell-rimmed
glasses and slight gutteral, the Ger-
man exile presented a clear-witted,
logical speech that refused to “pull
any punches,” a speech more char-
acteristic of a prosecuting attorney
than of ex-apprentice lawyer who
ended in a German concentration
camp in 1933.

Speaking on why “I Took No
Oath to Hitler,” Dr. Kiess expressed
his entire attitude—and condemna-
tion—-by relating his own experi-
ences. Dr. Kiess refused to accept
the Nazi indoctrination on four spe-
cific bases, although often “invited”
to follow the party line:

(1) Although he was a paciﬁst,
he revolted against any German
armament program that were se-
cretly begun in 1933-34-—seeing in
them not a protective measure

against communist Russia, as the

British had been deluded to believe,
but rather a fake anti-French, anti-
British program for German hege-
mony.

(2) He would take no Hitler
oath because for personal belief in
private and political liberties, and
his inner revolt against the Hitler-
ian doctrine of personal slavery.

(3) A general revulsion against
all of the “lies” so well outlined in
Mein Kampf.

(4) Refusal to accept the razzle-
dazzle, the salutes, cheers, personal
tributes and deiﬁcation of Hitler.

Jumping off from this personal
expression, Dr. Kiess proceeded to
explain his concept of the Nazi pro-
gram and doctrines, the rise of the
Nazi party, and the subsequent re-
sult on the German spirit.

Health Chart

Continued from page one

Social health on the functional
side is also expressed in 12 funda-
mentals: action, rest, food control,
and distribution, elimination of dis-
ease, distribution of beneﬁts, social
behavior, education, reserves, hu-
man relationships, progress of so-
ciety and growth, religion and mor-
als, and social consciousness.

Physical systems, from the path-
ogenic standpoint, also 12 in num-
ber, include: normal weight, physic-
al health, radiations, normal glands,
normal vision, normal respiratory
system, normal gastro-intestinal
system, normal circulatory system,
normal genitro-urinary system, nor-
mal nervous system, normal muscu-
lar system, normal bones and joints,
and healthy skin.

Through the use of the personal
health estimation. chart, Dr. Carl-
son believes that students may cal-
culate or estimate their own per-
sonal health and may, therefore,
better cooperate with family
physicians and other health work-
ers in arriving at functional and
pathogenic health.

of local government, the church and
the state.

sities of Minnesota, Chicago, Berlin,
and Paris, and Bonn, Grenoble,

versity of Chicago, and won the
