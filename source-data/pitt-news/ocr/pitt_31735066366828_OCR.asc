Student Government
Accepts Constitution
In Unanimous Vote

By DAN BOOKER
Student Government (SG)
approved a new constitution
in unanimous action Tues-

day. This constitution is es-
sentially the same as the one
passed by SG in January but re-
turned to committee for review
by Jerry Hogan, former SG pres-
ident.

Before taking effect the docu-
ment must be approved in a stu-
dent referendum. Ralph Manning,
SG president, and Terry Hyman,
chairman of the constitutional
committee, plan to conduct the
referendum before the end of
the trimester. The Board of Trus-
tees and the University Senate
must also approve the constitu-
tion. '

A General Assembly, Presi-
dent’s Council and University Re-
view Board are-substantial addi-
tions to SG provided for in the
proposed constitution. The Gen-
eral Assembly would be com-
posed of two members of every
recognized student organization
and would have the power to
make recommendations to the
Senate on important student is-
sues.

Members of the President’s
Council will be presidents of ma-

FRED N. FRANK
New Editor

Fred Frank, a junior history
major, has been named editor of
The Pitt News for the Spring,
Fall and Winter Trimesters. Busi-

ness manager will be Tassia Pa-_

 

jor student organizations. They
may speak at Senate meetings but
do not have the power to vote or
to make motions from the ﬂoor.
The University Review Board
would be authorized to review
the constitutionality of any SG
enactment and could also review
disciplinary cases involving stu-
dents.

The president of SG would
have ‘the authority to veto meas-
ures passed by the Senate, a pow-
er not given in the existing con-
stitution. If adopted, the docu-
ment would limit the number of
senators to 2 and elminate the
seats held by vice-presidents of
some campus organizations.

These provisions, except the
one concerning the senators, were

part of the constitution present-
,ed by Charles Hollander, John

Ruskay, and Dyanne Hochman,
who were senators at the time.
Senator Hyman noted that Hol-
lander had acted as advisor to his
constitutional committee and de-
served “a great deal of credit.”

In other business, the Senate
elected Arlis Belsky, Liberal Arts
sophomore, to ﬁll the Senate seat
vacated by Senator Dina Natali.
Miss Natali left her seat as Lib-
eral Arts senator to assume the
position as vice-president of Wom-
en’s Housing Board.

In addition, the Senate ex-
amined the allocations made by
the Student Activities Fee Alloca-
tion Committee. All but three of
the Committee’s recommendations
were approved by the senators.
Allocations requests from the
Student Union Board, the Pitt
Players, and the Pitt Photo Club
will be reconsidered by the A110-
cations Committee. Of the $24,-
500 available for allocation, $16,-
012 were allocated tothe organi-
zations which applied for funds.
A total of $27,590 had been re-
quested by these organizations.

Steinberg Receives Degree;   
Top Students Are Honored   

By ROBERT ZAVOS

Dr. William Steinberg, music
director of the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony Orchestra, received an
honorary Doctor of Humanities
degree at Wednesday night’s an-
nual Honors Convocation in Syria
Mosque.

Over 900 students, including 21
University Scholars, from the va-
rious schools’ were cited for dis-
tinguished scholarship. Preceed-
ing the presentation of the Hon-
ors Students and University Schol-
ars, Acting Chancellor David H.
Kurtzman stated, “We have long
since abandonned the ivory tow-
er. Pure scholarship divorced
from reality is not enough. Schol-
arship provides the only key to
freedom.”

Dr. Charles H. Peake, vice-chan-
cellor of academic disciplines,
presented over -550 Honors Stu-
dents from the School of Liberal
Arts and 41 from the School of

ing ovation after the presenta-
tion of the honorary degree by
H. J. Heinz, II, vice-president of
the Pittsburgh Symphony. Mr.
Heinz remarked that Dr. Stein-
berg has made a great contribu-
tion to Pittsburgh and music. He
further commented, “Dr. Stein-
berg has made the Pittsburgh
Symphony Orchestra famous on
both sides of the Atlantic.”

The main program for the eve-
ning was a presentation by a
special group from the Pitts-
burgh Symphony under the di-
rection of Associate Conductor
Ronald Ondreijka. The orchestra
began with Mozart’s “Eine Kleine
Nachtmusik” from Serenade for
String Orchestra. The second se-
lection was Adagio for Strings
by Samuel Barber.

The ﬁnal piecewas from Tschai-
kowsky’s “Serenade” for String
Orchestra in C Major, Opus 48.
The program ended with the Al-
ma Mater sung by the audience.

a ﬁlm series on Mass Passion at
noon Sunday in Stephen Foster
Memorial Auditorium. T i c k e t s
will cost $1.50 and can be ob-
tained at the Student Union Desk
or at the door.

The program will consist of
four ﬁlms. Two" will deal with

- “Criminology and the Caper” and

the other two will be experimen-

will be The Big Sleep produced
in 1949, starring Humphrey Bo-
gart and Lauren Bacall, with a
private-eye type plot. League of
Gentlemen, starring Jack Hawk-
ins will be the “Caper” movie.

tlemanly criminals who rob a
bank in military, disciplined,
fashion.

 Kenneth Rexroth

By JAY GLASSER.
— __ The trouble with America
_ today is that art has become
‘ -too. commercialized, with the
-. artist becoming the purveyor
of a commodity instead of
_, the craftsman he had been

in the pre-industrial society. This
. is the problem of the “Arts in an
Age of Anxiety,” according to Ken-
‘ neth Rexroth, speaker at Wednes-
day's Student Union Board Pub-
lic Affair Series.
It is a sociological fact that the
artist is not at home in a com-
mercial industrial society. The
nature of production and circula--
tion and punching time clocks is
not suited for artistic endeavors.
The secret of music's success is
that it has not been divorced
from society like painting. Music
has always been accepted as part
of society and the composer has
ong been paid for his efforts,
fromithe patronage of the aris-
tocra A toi_,tl_1e present, ties with

Sh

  

Speaker Hits Commercial U. S-

In contrast to the close connec-
tion between the musician and
society is the divorce of painters
from society. But in recent times
has come the discovery that
alienation can be a popular com-
modity. Active alienation and at-
tacks on society have become a
basic principle of art. The trou-
ble in America today is that
things like the current “happen-
ings” have become “pop” art.
Now criticism doesn't last past
the initial shock. Even ‘the new
fad of scarcastic silencelhas be-
come accepted.

While most poetry is in an un-
assimilatable literary world of its
own that of ‘Bob Dylan is assim-
ilated. Most people do not think
of Bob Dylan as a poet, but his

pic and it is his voice that “turns
people off.” He has sharp insights
but no tradition to back him up.

_ I dent Publications,
Rexroth , considers .- modern jazz__ .

which the artist has a man-to-
man relationship with audience.
This artist,-audience relationship
is of a pre-industrial kind. Jazz
today is sophisticated and tech-
nically reﬁned, in a manner like
15th century counterpoint, with’
higher standards than pop.

Modern painting and sculpture
have become “hot commodities”
but the purpose behind them is
now to destroy the purchaser
psychologically. Anyone who can
afford the price of the art works
can afford the fees of a psychia-
trist to bring him back in line
with society.

Art Cohen

 

   

 

In January an article in Varie-
ty, the bible of the entertainment
industry, dealt with the problem
of cataloging and locating many
of the motion pictures of the past
and present. Last October, Har-
per"s ran an article describing the
rise in collegiate ﬁlm-making pro-
grams, whereby students write,
produce, direct, ﬁlm, and often
act in their own productions.

The fact underlying all this
activity is that the cinema as an
art form has become accepted,
both as a collegiate creative me-
dium and as a subject for his-
torical study. This may not be
so obvious to a culture which
every day shows signs of creep-
ing Ann-Margretism, but the ulti-
mate outcome of this research
and experimentation may be the
general improvement of popular
ﬁlms and ﬁlm standards.

The two realms of the histori-
‘an and the ﬁlm-maker overlap,
since the prospective De Mille
can learn much by studying the
early sﬂents and “talkies” as
fast as the ﬁlm curatorcan serve
them’ up. Here, however, is the
historian’s problem. The indus-
try itself has been so lax in cata-
loging and preserving its" own ef-
forts that much material from
many eras in cinema history has
either been lost or destroyed.
“As a result,” writes James L.
Limbacher in Variety, “probably
no art has ever been so badly
researched, documented and han-
dled as the ﬁlm medium—-and it
is a medium in which all _ the
creative works could easily be
available, but aren’t.’’ ‘
Trying to help solve this prob-
lem, the author later calls for
help from Government and the
movie industry alike. He asks, too,
for private collectors to surrender
their sole surviving prints of rare
ﬁlms. “Unless the great ﬁlms of
the last seven decades are avail-
able for showing,” he says, “much
-of the work of hundreds of ﬁlm’s
artists wﬂl remain nothing but

Commuters a

To Meet I

The Commuter Association will
hold an organizational meeting
on Monday at noon in Dining
Room A of the Student Union. At
this time applications will be
available for Council positions.

The favorable results from the
pilot study this trimester have
demonstrated the need for such
an association. With the encour-
agement of the Vice-Chancellor
of Student Affairs it was decided
that the organization should be
formed immediately because of
the inevitable increase in_ the
number of commuting students
.With the Planned state-related-
ness. _ .

The organization‘ will serve to
represent commuters by helping;
them to solve their speciﬁc prob-'
lems, as well as a means of in-
tegrating commuters with the rest
of the school. The Council will
consist of 20 to 30 seats. Appli-
cants will be selected on the
basis of their ideas and inter- '
views.

The organization will be co-
sponsored by Associated Women
Students (AWS) and Men’sCoun-
cil. Chairmen of the committee
are Ron Cowell, Linda R. Davis,
Roy Meckler, and Basil Zatelli.
Advisors will be Kay Shenesky,
president of AWS; Barry Roth,

paragraphs in a ﬁlm history
book.”

While the historians are busy
locating the ancient works, the
collegiate producers are turning
out their own ﬁlmed commen-
taries on contemporary life. Some
are documentaries, some are dra-
. mas, and many have their own
modern jazz sound track.

The ﬁlm-makers study the great
works of the past and present,
but as David C. Stewart writes in
Harper’s, “about all they believe
they can learn from Hollywood is.
what not to do.‘ They are aware

ly important, but theemphasis in
their movies is much more upon
ideas than technique.”

Schools such as Boston Univer-
sity, Ohio‘ State, University of

Columbia, and New York Univer-
sity boast of ﬁlm-making pro-
grams, Stewart _reports, and the
number is increasing each year.
The eventual goal of these pro-4
grams, of course, would be to
have these ﬁlms distributed com-

mass audiences for the new ﬁlms.

At other schools, the interest in
the cinema is more historical
than creative. “These students
for the most part are not study-
ing for a career in ﬁlm-making,”
Variety reports, “but rather to
appreciate and understand the
medium better.”

With the improvement of audi-

than’ the actual production of
ﬁlms, the series wﬂl present two
full-length and two experimen-
tal ﬁlms Sunday noon in Steph-
en Foster Memorial.

_i College women live in a
-dream world, says the Daily
{<Texan, University of Texas.
.For four years they are equal
0 men. They compete with
hem for grades, for honors,
or recognition. They can
ven become student body
residents or newspaper edi-
ors.-

The Daily Texan said in an
ditorial:

MANY WOMEN graduate
expecting to ﬁnd careers in
‘which they can use their ed-
iucation, where they can be
.-“fulﬁlled.” “Me? A mere
housewife? Never!” they say
idisdainfully. Most will ﬁnd
fitliat while their understand-
"ing of Eliot and Toynbee and
Kierkegaard may make life
jinﬁnitely richer, it may not
?:make them materially as
‘well off as a few courses in
shorthand and typing.

7', A lucky few will snare
positions in which they can
fmake good use of their edu-
‘cation and intelligence. We
;are warned, however, that
vgcareers may not be as attrac-
tive in the ﬂesh as they seem
n one’s imagination. Of
course, many men, too, are
subject to post-graduate dis-
-appointment.

, Still, more men are suc-
 cessful than women. Some
' ipersons still insist that wom-
en simply are not as intellect-
ually agile as men. That’s
why there have been no fe-
male Tolstoys or Beethovens
or Neitzsches, they argue.
There haven’t been any Ne-
gro Beethovens either, but
that doesn’t mean there
.won’t be.

L WOMEN AND NEGROES
are both second class human

  
   

  

  

 

  

 

  

  

  

  

 

  

cording to a recent magazine
article by satirist Jules Feif-
fer, ,Negroes are “star vic-
tims_’ while: “Women’s posi-
tion is far less dramatic and,
consequently, less conscience-
demanding (than the Ne-
gro’s). Lost in the shadow
of our greater prejudices,
she drags along, her prob-
Iem not taken seriously by

The Student Allocations Committee and the Activities Fee need seri-
ous evaluation before continuing in their current status. The,_C0mm1ttee S

The result is a non-allocated surplus of $8,500 comblned With $3.500 from

This surplus of $12,000 (one-fourth of the total monies collected)
should not exist and is the result of vague, inadequate criteria used for
allocations. We agree that perhaps $2.000 Per t€_I‘m Should be kept in re-
serve for emergencies, but the $12,000 surplus is a glaring testimony to
the failure of the fee to serve the students.
There are organizations which were either denied allocations or
given a low percentage of their requests. These organizations should not
have been denied monies because (1) they unquestionably serve no one
student, and (2) there was sufficient money available. _
For instance, Men's Dorm Council received 33 per cent of its re-
quested amount ($300 of $1,000), the Owl received 50 per cent of its
request ($500 of $1,000), Student Government received 38 per cent of
its request ($650 of $2,500).

C The activities of all these organizations serve a large number of
students. They should be granted the requested working capital to pro-
mote their programs. We do not feel the current criteria of the Committee
are just in this sense. They require a point by point delineation of all

The only criterion now in use is that an organization must present
an outline of the events for which the money would be used. The degree
of service and the number of students affected by an organization arenot
explicitly considered. Organizations geared to speciﬁc interest groups

based on their ability to program for large numbers of students. Such

she has neither a rock of

anchor it. Woman is a sec-

is her problem? We all know
it is man.”

According to Feiffer, men
created women simply to be-
come “deliciously conscious
of themselves.” They really
don’t like women at all.
Whether or not women are
liked by men, most of them
will choose or be forced into
a role basically of satisfying
a male counterpart. There
seems to be a basic motiva-
tion for women to look up to
men, for men to look up to
men, and for no one to want
it any differently.

Even with standard allocations, there would be sufficient funds

available to serve other recognized organizations. The speciﬁc interest

Mamdani is currently novice manager of the Debate Union, an

Trees Hall Route

Dangerous at Night
Editor, The Pitt News:

Monday evening, the members
of women's physical education
dance classes 'were required to
attend a master given by Daniel

_ Nagyrin at Trees Hall. The class

extended until after 10 p.m. at
which time the girls were left
to wind their way down the hill.
For those with transportation this
was no heartache. But, for the
remainder, who had to walk,
even traveling in groups was to
no avail. A purse was stolen. Two
boys ran up the walk towards
Pennsylvania Hall. Three girls
remained speechless. They can
be thankful. There was no phy-
sical harm.
The numerous routes back to
. the campus are all poorly lit and
the neighborhood is not the best.
It is safe for no one. A petition
for evening bus service for Uni-
versity students remains posted
between the men’s and women’s
locker room at the gym. If it is
true that the campus bus service
is privately owned and operated,
then it is up to the University,
particularly the physical educa-
tion department, to make it avail-
able. If it is not, no .woman
should be made to- attend any
class unless she is assured of
rides back to the dorms. _
When informed of the incident,
which occured at the side en-
trance to Scaife Hall, the Univer-
sity police informed us ‘that there
are two officers on beat in the
area. This is hardly sufficient. It
is truly sad if University‘ facil-
ities cannot be made available to
the students in consideration of
their interests and well-being. '
May I suggest that these con-
ditions be altered, either by the
University or. the respective in-
structors who request evening at-
tendance at classes, or, that such
classes, team practices, and spe-
cial events be held during the
-day. If’ this situation remains ig-

1 nored, there will ultimately be

limited attendance at Trees Hall,
recreational or otherwise. But,
more importantly, there remains
the opportunity for far more seri-
ous assaults. . ' -

appeal. The fee Was paid by the student body, a large, heterogenous group,_
but is not serving those organizations which serve the broad interests.
We heartily recommend the Committee’s adoption of a standard

Shidemantle Article

Slurs Other Teams
Editor, The Pitt News: '
‘My congratulations to the writ-
er of the article on Dave Shide-
mantle which appeared in the
March 9 edition. It was truly a
ﬁne example of how someone
with a good degree of journalis-
tic ineptitude could begin with-
a report on the accomplishment
of a ﬁne athlete and turn it into
a slur against every athlete in
this University who competes ‘in
a winter sport.

M.r. Shidemantle certainly is
worthy of praise but, to take his
victory and set it as an example
as the “Lone Winner in Winter,”
shows in my opinion, a great lack
of respect for the entire‘Pitt or-
ganization of coaches and ath-
letes. ‘

I am not professing a strict‘
adherence to the philosophy, “it’s
not whether you Win or lose, it’s
how YOU play the game." I’ll be
the ﬁrst to agree that its great
to be a winner and it is extreme-
ly important to any sport. But,
as a varsity athlete in high school,
I learned that training under su-
Dervision and organized competi-
tion are also important factors.

A1th0118h I am not capable of
competition on the college level,
I can't help feeling slightly dis-
gusted that the -student newspa.
Der can have a sports page that

is so preoccupied with the home
team winning.

Intentions Of Course Evaluation

(The following is a preface to
the Project Teach Evaluation
Booklet written by the Project
Teach committee. The evaluations
are available free upon request at
the student desk, ground floor,
Cathedral and the Student Union
desk.)

Project Teach’s goal in attempt-
ing to publish a student evalua-
tion of undergraduate courses is
to establish a system of communi-
cation from students to fellow
students, administration, and fac-
ulty. This effort had been put
forth in many previous attempts,
but Project Teach remains uni-
que insofar as its represents stu-
dent concern and, initiative to es-
tablish such a dialogue with the
help of interested faculty mem-
bers.

After it was decided that a stu-
dent evaluation of courses would
be a successful ﬁrst step in reach-
ing the ultimate goal, colleges
that had sponsored such pro-
grams were contacted. Informa-
tion obtained through these ‘con-
tacts launched a pilot study that
totaled three test questionnaires,
distributed in selected classes
and returned via campus mail.
From this study the questions for
the ultimate questionnaire were
derived and assembled for pub-
lication towards the end of Jan-
uary in three separate issues of
The Pitt News.

Fifteen hundred such question-
naries ultimately reached us
thorugh deposit boxes distributed
throughout the campus. These
forms were sorted [by professor
_and course, and then tallied. The
long and tedious efforts of count-
ing and discussing the results
showed that, although a seem-
ingly large number of .question-
naires had been returned, results
for individual classes were small
and unscientiﬁc.

Opinion expressed in response
to this questionnaire was from
anonymous sources and, there-
fore, did not necessarily reﬂect a
cross section of the University

‘student body. The replies were

from those who chose to voice
their oponion, not from all those
whoihad opinions.

After serious consideration of
the material that we had, it was
decided that printing conclusive
statements concerning the courses
would be an irresponsibel and
unscientiﬁc act. We felt, how-
ever, that it was of prime impor-
tance that a report of our efforts
be made available to the Univer-
sity community. For this reason
we chose to mimeograph a statis-
tical report of the results from
the 11 courses that seemed to
offer the highest degree of re-
sponse from the students. ,

To _ insure with the greatest
possible guarantee that this would
appear as a report, ‘and not as
conclusive statements, professors
of these 11 courses were given
the opportunity to assess their
courses in a questionnaire that
is herewith. reproduced in full.

Each professor was also free to
object to the printing of results
from the questionnaire for his
class. If suchwas the case he was
asked to specify the reason for
his objection in a. statement that
would appear in lieu of the sta-
tistical results. Presently all ques-
tionnaires are being forwarded to
the individual professors and are
available for your examination
at their discretion.

To a large extent our efforts have
been fruitful insofar as they have
spurred an active communication
within and between many groups
on campus. The failure, repre-
sented by our inability to pro-
duce an accurate student course

evaluation booklet, is due not
only to the ﬁndings inherent in
our system of obtaining responses
but also to the small percentage
of students who took an active
interest in our efforts and return-
ed the forms. Our hope is that
the ’report contained herein will
spur bigger and better efforts
next term by students who con-
stantly clammer for a larger
voice in decision-making on cam-
pus.

Our ﬁnal word must again be
one of caution! What" you are
about to read is information ob-
tained from anonymous sources.
Therefore, the statistics represent
the opinion of anonymous sources
and are not necessarily an ac-
curate reﬂection of the opinion
of the study body of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.

‘ Committee on Superior Instruction and has already undertaken to-.

o  0 I
Kehl V iews Project
(The following is an introductory statement to the Project Teach

evaluation written by Dr. James Kehl, dean of the school of ’
liberal arts.) .

The scholarship of an historian who relies on a contemporary,
newspaper account of a given incident while ignoring the facts set"
forth in relevant diaries, memoirs, court records ,and investigating’
committee reports is indeed suspect. On the other hand, if that news-
paper coverage were slanted and if ‘its misrepresentation motivated
individuals or groups to courses of action, such an account, though
erroneous, is vital to a deﬁnitive understanding of the given incident,
and cannot be ignored by the historian. ’

The following study of Liberal Arts courses recently completed"
by Project Teach is analogous to the scholarship of the historian noted
above. In their efforts to present something tangible to fellow stu-
dents, the Project Teach Committee, according to its own confessions,
was forced to ignore sampling techniques and survey research pro-
cedures followed by the professionals who clearly state that the re-,
sults can be little more than a quantifying of the traditional student
gossip about courses. Thus it is redundant to add that the survey
conducted through Pitt News questionnaires is suspect. '

.Introductio'ns to publications and papers of this kind are nor-
mally written by individuals who quality. (a) as authorities in the:
ﬁeld of study. (b) as supporters of thehypotheses and conclusions

I am disqualiﬁed on all such counts. I. am not a specialist in sampling
techniques; I have not read a single word of the manuscript, and
I have attempted neither to support nor to frustrate the efforts of
Project Teach; in fact, I have been explicit to all connected with
the endeavor in stating that, as dean of the School of the Liberal
Arts, I could not give any official recognition to a project conducted):
in this manner.

I do, however, feel qualiﬁed to comment on another aspect of
this request for introductory remarks, namely the task of placing this
manuscript in a general perspective. It is intended as a communica-
tlon by students for students; it is an effort to say that students are
conscious of the quality of teaching that is being done and that more
students should be awakened to such a concern; it is saying that stu- v
dents have ideas and opinions in this area, and they want an oppor-
tunity to be heard. This study, characteristic of the activity on many ‘

creased dialogue between faculty and students.

We should not overlook the second part of the analogy between
Project Teach and the reference to the _historian’s scholarship des-I
cribed in the ﬁrst paragraph. Although the Committee admits that
the results of this study may be inconclusive and at times misleading,
such efforts have contributed to a campus sensitivity regarding teach- .
mg. Some faculty members have been motivated to work with stu-
dents on Project Teach, others have undoubtedly given more thought .
to_ their _classroom presentations, and department chairmen have cer-
tainly given more consideration to assigning particular instructors to '.
particular types of classes.

In addition, the School of the Liberal Arts has established at’

survey seniors regarding one aspect of the teaching program. Perhaps;
these results would have been achieved in any event, but the know
ledge that Project Teach and similar groups were at work has un
doubtedly affected the time-table for such development; they helped.
to determine the priority that this concern for teaching should receive;-‘
and for this contribution, faculty, administration, and students should j
all be grateful. A

 Bobby Lewis raised his arm and pointed to a bare wall
..in his office. His eyes glistened as he said, ‘_‘Someday on
.1 that wall you’ll see a plaque. On that plaque will be written
The University of Pittsburgh, National Collegiate Athletic
iAssociation (NCAA) Baseball Champions.”

L The young coach insists that the day he comes back
from the NCAA world series with that plaque under his arm
‘will be the day that he retires. “On that day coaching base-
,‘ball will cease to be a challenge. I’ll probably become the
0 football coach after that and after we become the national
F champs there, I’ll help out basketball.” _

 Even if Lewis doesn’t get his dream, he’ll always be a
_ showman. An hour spent with Lewis must be the best free
{entertainment available in Pittsburgh. The empty chair in
the sports publicist’s office could be his for the asking.

Ever since-Lewis became coach, he has been waging a
. one man ﬁght for student support at games. He claims that
‘ his team must be the only one in the country that never
plays a home game. The irony of baseball’s solitude is that
j it’s always a winner. -
] Another season is less than a month away and the
- wheels are already grinding inside Lewis’ bald dome. “I’ve
1 'got a new idea this year. We’re going to have a batgirl. It’s
’ camp this year to have a bat going for you and since we’ll
have a girl it should also draw the boys out of the dorms.”

Last year Lewis’ prodigies made a short trip to the
NCAA regional playoffs, but judging from the average at-
tendance at home games at Forbes Field not many people
ever knew about it. One was given the impression that at-
tendance was by invitation only.

“We’ve got the best guarded secret at Pitt,” says Lew-
is. “Some kids graduate from this school without ever real-
, izing a baseball team existed. Maybe if we started charging
admission they’d walk across the street to see us. They
might think that if We’re charging money we must really
. be something special. Just. because We’re better than th'e
 Pirates is no reason to take us for granted.”
. Student support is not the only thing bothering Lewis.
The one scholarship -he is given to work with places him in
 a good position to apply for funds from Johnson’s poverty
 program.
' With all due respect to Dave Hart, Lewis must be the
._best recruiter this University has. Dave Welty, the South
_ Catholic whiz, was the most sought after baseball prospect
- in Pittsburgh when he graduated last year. Lewis had him
coming to Pitt when he was a junior.

This year he has been working on Sam Suskiewich, the

_ Beaver Falls lefty. The Pirates have indicated that they’ll

. draft Suskiewich number one this spring. Don’t be surprised
if he’s a freshman here next year. ’

’ His scholarship boys place Lewis in an awkward posi-

tion. He feels he has to play them no matter what happens.
— “I’ve committeed myself to them,” says Lewis. “Even if I

_ Lewis is a winner. He tells his players not to think
. about anything else but winning. They usually do. If you
happen to have a couple cans of beer and a date this spring
drop in on a Panther baseball game. “You can neck all you
want,” says Lewis. ‘‘You’ll also see some good baseball.”

 Team Prepares

For Outdoor Schedule

Under clear and sunny skies at Pitt Stadium this week,
track coach Carl Rees began running his team in prepara-
tion for the Spring season. Unlike his previous 11 seasons

where rain and snow chased the
trackmen into the Field House
throughout the month of March,
Rees started early on the one
problem which plagues him every
year.

“Every year the runners must
tackle the same problem,” Rees
said. “It’s one of getting used to
the outdoor cinder track after
running on the wooden track at
the Field House."

Some runners not only must
adjust to the track, they must
also adjust to different distances.
“Dick Crout runs better in the.
quarter-mile. (440-yards) outdoors
than in the sprints which he
runs indoors,” Rees said.

Crout also will run in the 220
as will Chet Wojoiechowski, who
doubles in the 100-yard dash.

Although the regular schedule
doesn’t start until April 23 with
the Ohio Relays, Wojoiechowski
and‘hurd1er,Tom Christie were
invited to the Cleveland Invita-
tional. “Both of these boys are
from Cleveland and they wanted
local talent on hand,” Rees said.
“We were supposed to send a
mile relay team to the meet, but
that was changd.” *

Eiseman Only Wants to Win

Squeezed in between the big names of last year’s base-
ball team—Fred Mazurek and Doug Chambers——was second
baseman Steve Eiseman. He had a poor year at the plate,

but he somehow managed to get
on base more times than Was his
fair share. This year he should
be one of the big names.
Despite a .197 batting average,
Eiseman was elected co-captain
along with Ferd Sauer upon the
conclusion of last year’s season.
Even if his hitting improves this

year, his real value to baseball‘

is his attitude.

He pushes people. If he sees
someone loaﬁng in practice, he’s
not afraid to tell him to shape
up. He wants another shot at the
NCAA title and he takes advan-
tage of his seniority to make sure
that everybody else feels the
same way.

“If you don’t play to win you
shouldn’t play at all. If we lose
it’s just a wasted day,” -as far as
Eiseman is concerned. “I want to
see nine hustling guys out on that
ﬁeld, If there’s one problem we
have it’s with the hot-shot. After
one season he’ll know he’s part
of a team and not just an in-
dividual.” '

“Last year we had a real close
knit group and (Barry) Wetzel
and Chambers were never forced
to lead. This year it’s different.
I’m not trying to push anybody
or boss anybody. I just want to
make sure they want to win as
much as I do.”

When someone lives for base-
ball’ as Eiseman does, a few bad
breaks at the beginning of the
season might crush his spirit.
But as far as Steve’s concerned
a few bad breaks aren’t possible.

“When you start to think about

how you might lose, you might
as well quit. When you think
about losing in a game you’ll
eventually ﬁnd a. way.”

This year’s mitters should have
a tight defense with Tom Becket
at third and Eiseman at second.
The major problems will be ﬁnd-
ing a catcher to replace Cham-
bers and hitting comparable to
Mazurek, who batted .470 last
year.

If Eiseman’s bat comes to life
this Spring many of coach Bobby
Lewis’ troubles should be solved.
Eiseman started off last season
strong with two hits in his ﬁrst
game. He added two more in the
year’s ﬁnal game.

“I was desparate last year,”
says Ste.ve. “I kept getting a piece
of the ball, but it was always go-
ing straight to the ﬁelder. Then
I started changing my swing
around and by the middle of the
season I was really messed up.
It took me all summer to straight-
en it out. I hit .325 in the Great-
er Pittsburgh League.”

White Spring game at Pitt Sta-
dium.

Please don't
zlupf Sprite.

It makes ,
plenty of noise
all by itself.

Sprite, you recall, is
the soft drink that's
so tart and tingling,
we justcouldnW.keep
it quiet.

Flip its lid and it
really flips. '
Bubbling, fizzing,
gurgling, hissing and
carrying on all over
the‘place.

An almost exces-
sively lively drink.

Hence, to zlupf is
to err.

What is zlupfing?

Zlupfing is to drinking what
smacking one's lips is to
eating.

It's the staccato buzz you
make when draining the lastfew
deliciously tangy drops of
Sprite from the bottle with a
straw.

Zzzzzlllupfl

It's completely uncalled for.
Frowned upon in polite society.
And not appreciated on campus
either.

But. If zlupfing Sprite
is absolutely essential uayour
enjoyment; if a good healthy
zlupf is your idea of heaven,
well. .all right.

But have a heart. With a
drink as noisy as Sprite, a
little zlupf goes a long, long"
way.
