The ‘Panther Letter’

Mysterious,Letter ‘that prompted midnight plans.

A daring Pitt News Editor and a hardy band of Sigma
Chis set out on a mission Monday night to return the missing

bronze Panther to its rightful

resting place in the Dean. of

:-

In answer to a cryptic note delivered to the, News ofﬁce
early Monday morning, the mechanized task force of “more

than 30 men” staked out the Field¢

House for an hour long period
\using Kovar as bait. The mysteri-
ous note consisted of a message
spelled out in words clipped from
a newspaper and pasted on a sheet
of crumpled and ﬁre-scorched pa-
per.

It read: “Editor: If you want
your Pitt Panther back meet me
a, the Field House ALONE at 11:30
tonight. (Signed:) Rike.”

Fearing a trap and possible ab- I

duction by the authors of the note,
the Editor ‘arranged for ﬂying
squads of Sigs to patrol the -area
as well as a picket line of Sig-
loaded parked cars and several
foot patrolmen.

keep the bitter chill from his
bones, the vigilant watchers in-
spected every passing car and the

patrol made regular rounds. For
45 minutes the game continued
until, at last, realizing the Panther-
nappers had been too cowardly to
carry out their plan, the frozen
and weary Kovar was bundled
into a car by almost-as—frozen-
and-weary cohorts.

Carrying the ﬁght to the enemy,
the cavalcade sped to a Tech fra-
ternity house and the office of the
Carnegie Tech Tartan'in hopes that
either the Panther or the plotters
would be found. The raid was
fruitless though, and the band con-
tented themselves with scaring the
pants off several Plaidsmen when
they milled around the entrance to
the buildings.

Student Congress
Gives Cheerleader
Query to Students

Student Congress has decided to
turn over the question of women
cheerleaders to the students- In
a motion passed unanimously at
Monday's meeting, the solons vot-
ed for a referendum to be con-
ducted at registration in January.

Sam ‘Ealk, head cheerleader,
made the original 'motion which
contained two provisions. First the
reestablishment of a faculty-stu-
dent committee to consider and
serve as an advisory board for
the problem of the cheerleaders.
And second, the student referen-
dum to -be administered during
registration.

Though none of the women in
SC voted against the_proposed
referendum, Hazel Hallam, vice
president, felt that the vote should
be “up to the women only.” Emil
Herman, Sophomore class repre-
sentative, urged that the vote be
held for both men and women.

For Tomorrow

BY CARMEN VILLELLA

The third annual Christmas
Commons Room Ball will be
held this Friday evening from
9 p.m. to 1 a.m. Maurice Spi-
talny and his’ orchestra will
provide, music for the occasion.

Tickets cost $3 and may be pur-
chased at thelstudent Desk, in the
dean’s office on the eight ﬂoor, or
from any of the student repre-
sentatives. '

Stormy History

The history 01' the CR Ball dates

back three years. It was sponsored

ect which consisted of two all-
student dances, a senior dance and
a Christmas formal. The adminis-
tration objected on the basis or
a rule prohibiting dances in the
Commons Room. '

Bill McKinley, class of '52 and
vice-president of Student Con-
gress, argued the ‘case for the stu-
dents. He was given permission
to hold dances in Stephen Foster
Memorial but was refused permis-
sion to. hold dances in the Com-
mons Room.

Approval Granted -
McKinley then presented to the
administration a petition to hold
a, Senior Graduation dance in the
Commons Room. This petition was
based on the fact that the strong
sentiinent connected with» the
Commons Room would make it a
desirable location for a dance. Al-
so, the cost of the dance would be
much less than the rental of a ho-
tel dance ﬂoor.

granted for both Senior and
Christmas dances in the Common:
Room.

closed December 24 to 26. and

’ -‘ ‘ There \isn’t. much of a Christmas air about the world-

todays as‘ the holiday season approaches. Even the weather

 of minutes.

“days that mark the end of December. The world has re-_

‘laxed itsvigil since the Korean peace talks began after
theLprisoner exchange several months ago, and the. super-
charged air of hostility that hovers over the Panmunjom
"area seems“ to fade in time and distance when we follow
the story through the impersonal media ,.of newspaper re-
porting. And yet, we face a Christmas that is overshadowed
by threat and insecurity on a world-wide‘ basis. There is
no peace on this Earth today. There is fear, and worry and
heartache in its place. There is a longing for loved ones
serving in the armed forces. There is the bitter realization

 that many sons are. not alive to share a Christmas dinner

that they so lavishly praised last year and the year before
when families were together. f G
The distant scenes of Korea and Russia are not the only»
ones to mar the complete realization of a “Merry Christmas.”
In Washington today we are faced with an internal con-

, ﬂict between factions of the ruling. political party. Threats,

challenges, counter-accusations——each causing the fang of
worry and wonder, to pierce a triﬂe ‘deeper. If we, as a
united country, cannot have the solidarity necessary for a
deep and lasting peace,,ho,w can we expect or hope to set

With Christmas just ahead and the Commons
Room Christmas Party scheduled for this after-
noon,’ perhaps we should let the little old gentle-
man with the red suit and pot belly know what
some of the faculty and students would like to see
under their Christmas tree.

Beginning at the top, Chancellor Fitzgerald
would undoubtedly like Oakland
wrapped up in a neat, little
bundle and presentedito him a
week from tomorrow. The trus-
tees‘ will probably be pleased
with" titles to this property and 
paid bills of sale. , g

A Vice-chancellors, Nutting and
Moore aren’t exactly sure what:
they would like since they -’
haven’t found out " exactly what"
they need in their new jobs but we imagine Dr.
Nutting would appreciate several new campus
buildings and Dr. Moore should gush over a spank-
ing—new medical school. ' T
i For the University Registrar from all the stu-
dents: a fool-‘proof registration system that 'won’t
take more than three hours per student and a place
to hold registration.

The Bursar? Heck, he just wants money.

Uncle Tom—’,A,Cabin?‘

Athletic Director Tom Hamilton ran out of paper
when he made out his 1ist""but, a packed Stadium
and Field House for each game would please him no
end. The coaches want more spectators for their
sports -too, but they wouldn’t mind less’ killing
schedules and the material to play them with.

mons Room and a second twelfth floor plus three
times as many women students to even up the

It Needn't be Expensive...

The —C-ift Reflects

‘By Irene, Rozakis
Seems like a lady" in‘ one of the downtown
papers wrote an article on a unique little service

which reminds husbands who are “too busy to re- ‘

member the wife’s birthday or a wedding anni-

e versary” of those important dates.

 T’ain’t bad enough that these guys could be
TOO BUSY to remember. ‘
g This lady goes on. to say: “If he’s smart, he

‘dials a store number, tells his, troubles to-a shop-G

per, and leaves the job ‘of gift—selecting, wrapping, ‘
and delivery in her capable hands. It is as simple
as that.” 1' ‘ ' ~ .

Ye gods! Isvrornance allidead? Imagine entrust-
ing so important a task as choosing a gift for hus-
band, wife, or best friend to a disinterested strang-
er. Makes about as much sense as telling‘ a stranger
to go out and buy you a pair of nylons when she
doesn’t know what size you wear. a‘ W

Maybe I’m just a sentimental old,cuss, but I al-

mways thought you were to pick gifts with the receiv-

er in mind. Supposing the “busy" .mari does call up

a store and says td’ the shopper, “Send sorne, ﬂo_w- 

ers to my wife,” or"‘pick outta nice piece of jew-
elry.” So his wife gets roses when she’d prefer
sweet peas. / ‘
Quality Makes, The Gift ,

Who cares if the gift is worth anything? ‘The
The‘quality that makes a gift valuable is the care
and- thoughtfulness behind its purchase.

who had a. shopping service pick_ out his girl’s
engagement ring, then deliver it to her. Phooey!
Is he giving her ‘a ring or, is he giving her his‘love?.

Maybe I’m a fanatic, but when I buy a gift, it
takes me hours, sometimes weeks, to ﬁnd the right
one. It isn’t easy on the sale clerks, I’ll admit.
They don’t like dealing with people who want a
particular item for a particular person.

But it’s a wonderfulfeeling to know you’ve
picked just the right item for that person’s person-

just what I’ve always.wanted.” You can sense that
by the look in his eyes when he sees it.

“more than anyone else.

An Original Gift .

Gifts are material objects, but they should not
stop at being material objects. They should be in-
struments. You buy a radio, not because you just
want to own it, but because it is an instrumen
to bring programs to you. r

A gift "should be an instrument of affection,

one,-which tells the receiver that you really are '

aw.are“ ofhim as a distinct individual.

League Tie-up”
Beﬂers Stature

By RUSS FRANKE
Sports Editor

  

The University of Virginia’s entrance into the Atlantic
Conference was the wisest move the school has made in
many a year, at least in the judgment of Pitt wrestling coach
Rex Peery.

The move allowed Pitt to join the elite wrestling circle
of the East—the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Associa-
tion-—and become eligible ot participate in'a post-season
tournament outshone only by the NCAA tourney.

For three years, ever since the Panther mat sport gained
notable stature, the Blue-and-Gold has been on ‘deck. wait-
ing for an opening in the association. And as soon asthe
Cavaliers pulled ‘out, Peery and his men pulled in.

So this spring the Panthers will be rubbing shoulders
with Penn, Penn State, Syracuse, Temple, and the rest of

the 16 teams in the 48-year old league. The tourney is slated _

for Cornell Mar. 12-13. A
It appears as though Pitt has moved up another notch

in the national athletic picture.
' S * :1:

Being a member of some kind of an organized league
does wonders for any sport. Competition for a conference
championship increases the incentive of the athletes and
maintains the highest degree of interest and support among
the fans. Witness the huge crowds attracted by the. powers

*

* of the Big Ten in football and the prestige that attends a

bid to the major bowl games. Notre Dame is one of the
few exceptions to the rule, but its long-standing supremacy
and volunteer alumni stimulate enough interest to obviate
any tie-ups. It is unfortunate that no suitable football con-
ference openings are available to Skyscraper U.

Fresh Get Stiffer Tests

Pitt’s frosh basketball team is getting its ﬁrst real tests
this week as a result of last night’s trip to Beaver Falls to

against major college competition.

The Cubs may have to play
without the services of.._6-6% cen-

ill this past week. He may, how-
ever, be ready when the starting
whistle sounds tonight. In the
event Brautigan is unable to play,

Since the penalty-callers noto

pool in preparation for their nine
dual meets and the championship
matches. '

Grady has returning lettermen
in every event but points out that
the schedule is much tougher this
winter. Last season, the ﬁns ended
with 3-4-1» but went on to take the
ECSA title. ‘ .

This year, though, Westminster,
an easy win, was dropped from
the schedule and both powerful
‘Duke and Lehigh were added. The
latter was runneup to the Pan-
thers in the ECSA and concludes
the dual meet competition, there-
fore giving a good basis for the
Panthers’ hope of a third straight
crown.

Top man among the returning

against the Carnegie Tech squad
in their next outing-—set for Jan.
14 at the Stadium range.

The ﬁrst win came at the ex-
pense of Duquesne when Sgt.
Davidson’s fairly experienced
group outshot the Dukes by a
1377-1345 score. ‘

' Judging from the past records
in the Greater ‘Pittsburgh Riﬂe
League, the‘ locals must enjoy the
same degree of success in their
subsequent matches. For the past
two years Pitt has wound up with
a 9-1 record,‘only to lose the title
in playoff meetings with West Vir-
ginia. P “

Programs for

Pitt Pistols, a group which pro-
motes student spirit on the cam-

vide entertainment- during, the
halftime intermissions at Field
House basketball games’.

Sam Balk, spokesman for the
Pistols, revealed that arrange-
ments were discussed at a recent

 

meeting and that a number of ac-,

tivity programs will be submitted
to athletic officials for approval.‘

At present, the group is consid-
ering such activities as girls vol-
leyball, gymnastics exhibitions, an
IM foul—shooting contest, V bad-
minton, ping-pong, the freshman
tug-of-war, and a student-‘faculty
hoop game. .

Last year’s half-time affairs
were limited to gymnastics exhi-
bitions and the Mens Council-Stu-P
dent Congress fray. a

Jack Hardman, assistant to the
Dean of Men, is the group’s advi-
sor. The organization is‘ devoted
to the development of school spirit
through fostering support ‘of school
activities with emphasis on ath-
letic events.
