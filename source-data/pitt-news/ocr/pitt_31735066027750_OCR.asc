THE KKK IS COMING! BEALARMED!
For those of you in the Pitt community
and beyond who are unaware that the KKK
is coming to Pittsburgh, consider yourselves
informed. The Klan plans to hold a demon-
stration in front of the Pittsburgh City
Courthouse on Saturday, April 5, from 1 to
3 p.m. By handing out pamphlets and trying
to talk (hopefully in vain) to passersby about
their sick, twisted, and unsubstantiated
views, they will be trying to publicize them-
selves and convert people to their ideals.

Even though this “great” country has
“progressed,” this hateful group is still alive
and active. On April 5, the KKK will be in
our town, on our streets, using our constitu-
tion to spread their hate and intolerance. We
will not accept this!

The K, however, will not be the
only group rallying. Pitt’s New Youth
Culture, along with members of the Black
Action Society, the Campus Women’s
Organization, the Asian Students
Association, the Indian Students
Association, the Student Government
Board, the Campus Coalition for Peace and
Justice, and others will be downtown at the
same time — across the street — rallying
against the KKK. And anyone interested in
showing his support and having his voice
heard will be very welcome to attend.

If you disagree with the Klan’s ideas

 
 

Thursday, April 3, 199‘

    
  

 

Be forewarned, the Klan is g
bringing its” hate to Pittsburgh

that one race (speciﬁcally, the white race) is 
superior to all others, COME RALLY! If
you believe that women and men of all

races, colors, ethnicities, and background:

deserve to be recognized and treated equal? ,
ly, COME RALLY! If you disagree with the 
spread of hatred and intolerance, COME 
RALLY! If you believe, like we do, that 

silence is acceptance, COME RALLY!

The only way to counter hatred is with
love! We are not rallying against the KKK
because we hate them. We are rallying
because we disagree with their beliefs. We
are going because we don’t want to be silent
witnesses to the spread of hatred. We are
going because we feel that EVERYONE
was created equally and we choose not to
hate. To us, variety is the spice of life.

“When I was four years old they
tried to test my I.Q. They showed me this
picture of three oranges and a pear. They
said, ‘Which one is different — it does not
belong?’ They told me different was
wrong.” —Ani Difranco

Erin Himmelberger is the copy editor for
The Pitt News, and she believes that most
people are smart enough to realize that dif-
ferent is not wrong.

Margot Douaihy is the co—president of the
Campus Wornenis Organization and won-
ders how close conservative, anti-aﬁirma—
tive action, anti-diversity extremists are to
putting on a white sheet.

We have bigger concerns

 

, The cowardly group in white robes and
pointy witch hats will make an appearance in
downtown Pittsburgh this Saturday. Yes, I am
talking about the Ku Klux Klan. Many civil
rights groups and other black coalitions plan
to hold rallies and insipid seminars. Guess
what —— I don’t give a rat’s ass.

Before you say, “I can’t believe you
would say that. Are you really black?” Yes, I
am black, and loving it too.

Too many times, we get sidetracked by
unimportant issues. How about us focusing
on the real issues that plague the black com-
munity: crime, missed education, unemploy-
ment, and getting all worked up over issues
that hide what the true problems are.

I am becoming increasingly intolerant of
excuses as to why we cannot transcend these
social ills. These problems can be transcend-
ed. I truly love my job tutoring young kids in
the Homewood—Brushton area. I enjoy intro-
ducing disciplines to youths who would not
get that exposure otherwise. However,
despite the fact that I am available to teach a
variety of disciplines, there aren’t many peo-

ple coming to learn, even though it’s for free!

If there is to be any demonstration, let it
be in our own communities, about the lack of
seriousness toward education instead of
wasting time on a group of masked, beer—bel—
lied men!

Our schools are not teaching us what we
need to know. Every year many blacks enroll
at Pitt, as well as other schools, with dreams
of becoming doctors, chemists, engineers,
etc. Sadly, many of them change majors
because they find themselves without
enough academic preparation.

Students (and parents) at predominantly
black schools appear to have a nonchalant
attitude toward chemistry, foreign languages,
and other challenging courses necessary to
remain in college and to become competi-
tive.

No, the Klan is not our number—one
problem! If we really want to demonstrate,
let’s pick a better cause. I am tired of excus-
es; I mandate that we pick credible causes to
support that will start producing tangible and
positive socioeconomic results.

THE . PITT NEWS

Let them rally, they've

already lost their power

 

Nearly 19 years ago, during my
junior year of high school, my political-
science class discussed a hypothetical
Ku Klux Klan march while role—playing
town council members. When it came
time to vote, everyone in my small
group voted to allow the Klan to march
—— everyone,jthat is, except me, who
felt that the group’s history of terrorism
made the demonstration inappropriate.

I remembered that class when the
KKK announced some time ago its
plans for a downtown Pittsburgh rally
to take place on Saturday, and I have
since changed my mind.

It’s not that I can ever sanction the
racial division and regressive, reac-
tionary politics that the Klan stands for.
However, I believe that KKK members
have the constitutional right to make
idiots of themselves if they so choose,
which is exactly what they’re doing.

And for that reason, I no longer
believe that the Klan represents any real
threat to society. In fact, most people
have already relegated the KKK to the
role of “has—been,” a relic of history ——
justly so, since its message has long
been discredited. ‘

Most people probably don’t realize
that the Klan has never functioned
strictly as a white supremacist organi-
zation. In fact, when the group was
formed in Tennessee in 1873, it first tar-
geted Northern “carpetbaggers” whom
Klan members felt would rape the
South economically and try to impose
“Yankee” culture on them. (In fact, that
was the real reason for the Civil War in
the first place.) Gradually, once the
newly freed black slaves became the
beneficiaries of considerable political
power, blacks became their primary tar-
get during the so-called«Reconstruction
period.

However, when the Klan moved
north and west (where there were fewer
blacks) in the 1920s, it had to change its
focus to include other “undesirables”
such as. Roman Catholics, Jews, for-
eigners, and other so-called “do—good-
ers.” The KKK saw such people as a
threat to what it considered Americas
“Protestant Christian” heritage. That
should explain the large, flaming cross
--- its notorious calling card.

(One important point ~-— being a
racist isn’t enough to join the Klan.
John Metzger, son of California white
supremacist Tom Metzger, was thrown
out of a KKK meeting a few years ago
because he would not openly profess

faith in a personal God.)

The beginning of the end of real
Klan power probably began in
Montgomery, Ala., on Nov. 14, 1956, in
response to the year—long and success-
ful black bus boycott that had ended
that day. One newspaper reported that
“about 40 carloads of robed and hooded
members” decided to drive through a
black neighborhood that evening, obvi-
ously to show them who was boss.
Normally, blacks would have respond-
ed with locked doors, pulled blinds, and
dark houses.

But not that night.

In fact, as Martin Luther King, Jr.
wrote in “Stride Toward Freedom,”
“Many walked about as usual; some
simply watched from their steps; a few
waved at passing cars.” Guess what?
The Klan was losing its grip! And when
the KKK became more violent through-
out the South, it began to turn more

people off. Even die—hard but peace-

loving segregationists began to ques-
tion whether the shootings, bombings,
and lynchings were worth preserving
their way of life. That’s how integration
came to fruition — and what really
killed the Klan.

Indeed, things have now come to a
point that when Bruce Wilkinson, a
Georgia Grand Dragon, openly
endorsed Ronald Reagan for president
in 1980 and said that “the Republican
platform could have been written by a
Klansman,” Reagan angrily, and thank-
fully, rejected the endorsement.

Not only that, but other groups
have since “stolen” some of the other
stances the Klan once took, but without
the racial baggage. The libertarian—ori-
ented, “states—rights” effort is still a
major concern in Southern politics, and
the religious right has taken over the
drive for moral and social purity and
against “liberalism.”

Even nativism is no longer exclu-
sively the domain of the KKK, thanks
to the Roman Catholic Pat Buchanan,
who made it an issue in the 1992 presi-
dential race. Buchanan’s views echoed
those of former, but hardly reformed,
Klansman David Duke, who was also
running for the Republican nomination;
Duke’s candidacy was so threatening to
the Florida GOP that the ACLU had to
come in. (Sound familiar?)

You know, I actually feel sorry for
those fellows.

Know why? They're neither want-
ed nor needed ——- and I think deep down
they know it.

Rick Nnwlin still /zasn 't decided what to
do on Saturday.

 

Did you know that...

0 Pitt’s School of Law established an Elder Law Clinic to provide
affordable legal counsel to elderly individuals. The clinic was designed
to meet the growing need of the elderly in the community as well as to
prepare students for law practice. '

  VIEWS A POINTED LOOK AT THE UNIVERSITY

 

Seven Piﬂly Sins
corrupt University

The following are the seven deadly sins of the
University of Pittsburgh. Some are committed sins, others,
sins of omission. Regardless, they are all evils which face
the University community.

I. The educational objective of this University should
be good, solid teaching and a liberal education, rather than
making students jump through hoops by completing silly
core requirements. Core requirements tend to be boring and
not intellectually challenging, making education a black
hole on intellectual interest, rather than the challenging and
stimulating experience learning should be. Core require-
ments are just repeats of everything you had to do each
year, kindergarten through now. Why not expand the minds
of students rather than relegating them to repetition of
things, like algebra, that they already know. Education is
about learning, not just regurgitating information.

II. The lack of a Convocation Center at this University
is unforgivable. Not only would a Convocation Center
house basketball games, graduation ceremonies, student
activity rooms, and recreational opportunities, but it would
also make Pitt more of a campus. Closing Bigelow isn’t the
only way to unite Pitt. Stop farming out graduation and bas-
ketball games to the Civic Arena and build a Convocation
Center.

III. The state of residence housing at this University is
appalling. There should be apartment-style on—campus
housing available to undergraduates. The dorms in exis-
tence need to be renovated. If you are going to charge
someone an arm and a leg for an eight-by-12-foot triangle,
it should, at the very least, not look like a scum pit. Dorm
residents should be treated with respect, and not forced to
buy meal plans they don’t want.

IV. The lack of interest that students showtowards
improving this University is despicable. Don’t stand around
and bitch about Pitt if you aren’t going to do anything to
make it better. You don’t have to lie down in the middle of
Bigelow during rush hour, but it only takes a couple of min-
utes to write a letter, an hour or so to attend a Senate
Council or SGB meeting. Laziness is no excuse. The only
way to change things is to make your concerns known.

V. Administrators need to have respect for the thoughts
and needs of students. Students need to act in a manner

. which makes them respectable.

VI. The William Pitt Union needs to be open 24 hours.
As the cultural hub of campus, the Union should provide a
safe study haven all night long as well as provide enter-
tainment opportunities outside of the bar scene.

VII. The libraries need to extend their hours so that
course materials and study space aregavailable at times that
fit in with even the most hectic student life. Students pay to
learn. Let’s make sure they have access to doing it.

The problem is with students, not school

 

As I near graduation, I have
been evaluating my time at Pitt.
When you talk to students here, a lot
of people complain, but what is actu-
ally wrong with this University?

Believe it or not, I actually had a
hard time thinking of something!
The only gripe I have doesn’t really
even concern the school directly.

You see, Pitt is not the ﬁrst
school that I’ve attended, so I have
others to compare it to.

Instead of going along with my
father’s wishes and enrolling in his
alrna mater, Pitt, I chose to go to
Gannon, a private university in Erie,
Pa. .
My reason for going there was
that it was smaller, and I felt I would
do better because I wouldn’t have
500 students in my classes.

I had the following image of Pitt
in my mind: all the classes were
taught in big lecture halls, and some
were even taught via closed-circuit
television between classrooms
because of their size. I thought I
would get lost in the shuﬂle at Pitt
and never make anything of myself.

Boy, was I wrong.

I have‘ never had any class with
more than 70 people in it my whole
three years here at Pitt. I know that
bigger classes do exist — but they
are the exception, and not the norm

that I had concocted in my head.

For these reasons, I don’t really
have any problems with the school
as such.

My main problem with Pitt is
with the student body.

Think about the last time you
attended an event at Pitt (if you can
remember that far back). Where
there a lot of people there? Probably
not, unless there was alcohol served

This school is full of APATHY !

There are 32,107 students at
Pitt. Wouldn’t you think that events
would at least be well-attended, if
not sold out?

They deﬁnitely aren’t!

Now, don’t get me wrong, I
know that when there is a big speak-
er or something controversial about
an event that people do show up.
But, why don’t students show up for
other events?

Supposedly, there are a lot of
students that are concerned about the
whole Bigelow Boulevard issue.
“Everybody” wants the road to close
so that when you are too hung over
to truly open your eyes to look both
ways, an accident won’t occur. '

If so many students allegedly
want the road to close, why didn’t
they support the closure efforts
more?

I’ll say it again —APATI-IY!

Last year, there was a rally to try
to keep the road closed after the trial
closure. It started in the afternoon

and ran until late at night when the
road was officially to re—open. The
organizers knew about our apathy,
so they even had bands and speakers
come to try to draw more people. If
everybody is so concerned with the
road closing, then why were there
not more than 100 people there at
any given time? Why were some of
the bands playing to a handful of
event organizers? Everyone says he
cares, but no one shows up.

All of these people who are now
writing letters to the Post-Gazette
and crying to The Pitt News about
the fact that the road isn’t going to
close have done too little too late.

Who could blame them for not
closing the street? Pitt is lucky that
the street is even being nanewed.
The other side had many supporters
who cared and actually showed up at
meetings and wrote letters. Pitt had
their typical handful of people that
really wanted to make a difference,
but the numbers were really lop-
sided.

Who would you listen to: a cou-
ple of college kids who probably
don’t vote anyway, or your con-
stituents who do vote and care to
show up? To me, this is an easy call.

Pitt students don’t even show
strong support at sporting events. If
the football or basketball teams are
doing well, there might be a decent
crowd at the games. Ifnot, then there

VIEWS A POINTED LooI< AT THE UNIVERSITY?

Graduate students are an

integral part

 

While we hear talk about possibly cut-
ting certain graduate programs, either now
or in the near future, if they don’t satisfy
some of the adrrrinistration’s vaguely
deﬁned fancies, I think somebody should
point out how important graduate students
are to undergraduates. I think that every-
body should point it out. Many people have
already noted the importance of graduates
to undergraduate education, but I think
there is so much more that they oﬂfer us than
just their presence in smaller classes.

Graduate students are closer to where
we are than professors are -— they were just
here. They still remember what it was like
to be an undergraduate, and they can share
the wisdom gained from their undergradu-
ate experiences. That enriches our experi-
ences immensely. Perhaps even more
importantly, they seem more human to us
than many professors do. While some pro-
fessors can intimidate or turn 011’ students
with their grasp of a subject, graduate stu-
dents are still learning the material and try-
ing to come to grips with it themselves.
They remember what it is like to be a stu-
dent because they still are students, and that

_ often makes them better and more under-

standing teachers. It can also be encourag-
ing to undergraduates when graduate stu-
dents show us that it’s possible to get where
they are, or wherever it is that we want to
go.

I owe my career decision to a graduate
student. Previously my teaching assistant
for mathematics, he took time to talk to me
when I was searching for a career path. He
told me what graduate study is really like,
reasons why and why not to pursue gradu-
ate study in mathematics, and what I need
to do if I want to get there. He could talk
ﬁankly to me in a way which no professor
has ever done. He could tell me things, from
firsthand experience, that no CAS adviser
would ever know.

Graduate students are one of the great-
est resources that this University has to offer
its undergraduates. It would be truly dam-
aging to remove any graduate program that
has an associated undergraduate major.
Graduate students are a middle link in a

 

of education

kind of master-apprentice-novice relation-
ship that goes on in universities, and that
relationship would be destroyed with the
middle link stolen away from us.

Pitt’s administrators claim that they
want to make the undergraduate education
here priority. Well, fomral education is just
a part of what going to college is all about.
There is also a culture here which teaches
students much more about life than their
classes. Interaction with people of differing
and greater experiences is essential to get-
ting the most out of these four years, and
interacting with graduate students can pro-
vide a lot of that.

Instead of thinking about cutting pro-
grams, Pitt’s administrators should be con-
cerned with trying to strengthen them. If a
graduate program seems weak, ﬁgure out
why and ﬁx the problem!

Students: if you’re not making use of
this great resource we have in graduate stu-
dents, do so. They have been where we are,
they lmow the turf, and they can help us out
a lot. Get to know your teaching assistants.
Oftentimes, you’ll ﬁnd that you will make a
new friend. Hang out with them, go to
lunch, ask questions. You can gain a whole
new perspective on your life by talking to
people who have dealt with the things
you’re facing.

This would be a good issue for the
SGB to go into battle for. I don’t just mean
taking a stand. Taking a stand isn’t enough;
you have to actually put up a ﬁght. Whining
and crying “We don’t like this!” just does-
n’t get the job done, folks. It’s time to forget
about the stupid Bigelow Boulevard thing;
we missed our chance, and it’s over.
Besides, a tiny little alleyway is not going to
make a difference in the quality of student
life here. How about ﬁghting for something
that will make a difference, like keeping
graduate programs open and keeping grad-
uate students hereto help us?

If we are going to make a diﬂ°erence,
we all have to band together and make this
work. If we are going to make an improve-
ment in the quality of the experience of
undergraduates at this University, then we
have to get busy. Now.

Someday, Kris Kissel hopes to be a gradu-
ate student. When it happens, don’t let them
take his program away.

 

Students   

is no chance of the games even being close
to selling out. Five years ago at Gannon, the

V football team came close to selling out every

game.

Students at other schools are proud of
their schools and show it by going to events.
The only thing that students at Pitt seem
proud of is cheap beer night. Hey, that’s the

 

 FROM PAGE 4  

only thing that is even close to being ﬁlled to
capacity.

Get out and attend an event before Pitt
decides to stop wasting money on its apa-
thetic students.

Russ Krebs is gonna miss this school when
he graduates. He is not so sure that he '11 miss
the student body.

 

Writing department
should focus on writing

The creative-writing‘ department
needs to be more creative. As a veteran
University student whose academic
interests have led her into no less than
four programs as possible majors — psy-
chology, art history, neuroscience, and
English writing — I ﬁnally had to come
to a decision. Not being thrilled with the
other three, I chose English writing.

Unfortunately, it so happens that I
am not quite so interested in English
writing,~either. I started off in the jour-
nalism track. Big mistake. “Taught” by
some dweeb from the Post-Gazette, we
spent the entire first six weeks ﬁgming
out how to write a one-sentence lead.
Pretty challenging stuff, yeah? Not
exactly. The fact is, anyone with a basic
command of the English language can
write a one-sentence lead. Furthermore,
this guy had all the personality and
charisma of an anemic goldﬁsh, so class
consisted of him staring at his notes and
mumbling under his breath about the
who, what, when, where, and how of
your basic “news” story, followed by his
dismal predictions about the future of the
written word. ,

After this, I decided to stick with
English writing anyway, the creative
track. I did well my first semester but
would have done better if I had not been
penalized for bad attendance. How bad
was my attendance? I think I missed ﬁve
classes instead of the permitted three.
Since I missed two because I was wait-
ing for a space to get into the class, quite
frankly this pisses me off. I don’t see the
point of a rigid attendance requirement
in a program like creative writing. Either
you do the assignments, or you don’t.

In the neuroscience program, there
was no requirement for attendance at
lectures, but if you missed one, you
would deﬁnitely miss some vital infor-
mation, and likely screw up the test --
and in a program ﬁlled with hyper-A
hounds like premed students, this is sui-
cide.

However, in creative writing, much
of the time is spent listening to the opin-
ions of other students on this or that. Not
only does this not appear on the test
(probably because there isn’t one), but it
is often extremely boring and fatuous.

“Workshopping” is a heinous inven-
tion to alleviate the professor’s having to
bother grading students’ work. The stu-
dents submit their stories to the profes-
sor, who makes a gazillion copies and
splits the students into groups. What
results is an embarrassing confrontation

with writers who are at least as bad and
inexperienced as you, and you have to
try to think of something constructive to
say about each other’s stuff.

All the time the professors are busy
marking your attendance into their little

black books, they are also not busy .

marking your work. Despite your dead-
lines for submission, their deadlines for
return are nonexistent. I’ve waited as
long as two months for work to come
back to me, complete with the com-
ments, criticism, and suggestions I am
waiting for and paying for.

I don’t want to sit in creative writing
class and listen to any more student opin-
ions. Too much talk! Either the professor
should deliver a lecture, based on a type-
written handout of the main points, per-
haps (that way you could “get it” any-
way, if you couldn’t come to class that
day), or the students should be chal-
lenged with in-class, timed writing exer-
cises. For me and the students I have
talked to, we actually enjoy being
pushed and challenged by creative exer-
cises. We don’t enjoy being punished for
attending. What is this, a university-level
class designed to inspire, inform and
improve, or a boot camp for recalcitrant
juveniles who are aren’t expected to do
much except be there?

If neither of those options of how to
spend class time are acceptable, why

I am waiting for are the written com-
mentsof my instructor, who is supposed
to be knowledgeable on the subject, why
should I have to sit there for three hours
to get them? Why not make class meet-
ings a one-hour, weekly session strictly
for retuming work and ﬁelding students’
questions? a

Length guidelines on creative writ-
ing are rather stiﬂing to the creative
process. If a story is complete in ﬁve
pages, isn’t it a bad thing to toss in 10
extra pages of nonsense to meet a page
requirement? lsn’t the point of creative-
writing courses to teach you how to write
well, which is not necessarily always
verbose?

A degree in English writing should
mean that you were challenged by
instructors who are knowledgeable in
their ﬁeld to be a better writer, whether it
be creatively or joumalistically. Not that
you were forced to sit in a classroom lis-
tening to other students talk about the
things you already know, duh, they’re
students just like you, rather than actual-
ly writing.

writing.

THE PITT NEWS

 

Klan leader brings message
of hate to Pittsburgh streets

Marc Nuzzo

C. Edward Foster wants to make
Pittsburgh the next stop on his path towards a
racially divided America. A ,

Foster, a Grand Dragon of the American
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, is among the
eight highest—ranking members of the
American Knights sect of the KKK. The
KKK is split nationally into nearly 100 dif-
ferent sects.

For the past several months, he has bat-
tled with the city government and civil dis-
content to get the permit to stage a KKK rally
in Pittsburgh. Last month, Foster took the city
to court for a permit.

The ACLU defended the Klan rally on

. the grounds of free speech. In an odd twist of

circumstance, the Klan ‘s attorneys were
descendants of Holocaust Jews.

The court battle was short.

Foster got what he wanted.

Although groups throughout the city are
preparing to stand up against his message of
hate and intolerance, Foster is undeterred.

Foster says that now that his Klansmen
are coming to town, they “have enough hate
to spread aroun ” and are prepared to voice
it. A
On Saturday monring, Foster will bring
a group of Klansmen to the steps of the city-
county building downtown to blast his ideals
into the city.

Foster explained in a telephone inter-
view what he plans to do, how he plans to do
it, and why.

His voice still hoarse ﬁom a KKK rally
he attended in Wilkes, N.C. earlier this week,
Foster spoke without hesitation about the
Klan’s social and political agenda.

In Your Face

When the Klansmen’s robes cast their
shadow upon the granite steps of the city
county building this weekend, it will be an
unprecedented move by the organization.
Thisrallyistheﬁrstofitsmagnitudeinthe

 

“This is the real thing,” said Foster. ‘This
is in—your-face.’’ ’

Foster says he will proceed onto the
courthouse steps, where a 500—watt ampliﬁer
system and horde of speakers will broadcast
his message of hate. From his perch, Foster
said he plans to “readdress [sic] the govem-
ment” with the KKK’s political agenda of
white suprerrracy.

"This is not a question—and—answer ses-
sion,” Foster said. He added that the Klan’s
proposed upcoming recruitment visit to
Gateway -school in Monroeville will be for
anyone who wants to question the Klan’s
agenda. '

As Foster prepares to face his “ene- .

mies,” he offered his opinion of those who
are coming down to Market Square with
signs in hand, those who are marching in
protest along the streets of Pittsburgh, and
those who will crowd, the paved streets to
conﬁont the KKK.

“Those dirty, rotten bastards in the com-
munist party are behind this. Not all of it, but

this weekend, they will be no closer to the
swarms of anti-Klan protesters’ agenda
than if they were on the moon.

_ In fact, most of the anti-Klan protesters
will be relaxing, dancing, and discussing
rrratters at a normal volume. The biggest
anti-Klan ‘rally will be held over three
blocks away from the Klan’s pulpit on the
city-county building — and in a cornplete—
ly different world of ideology.

“We decided to do nothing to encour-
age the Klan,” said Barney Oursler, co-
chair of the Pittsburgh Coalition to Counter
Hate Groups. The coalition is responsible
for organizing the Market Square counter-
rally, dubbed “Not in Our Town: People
United Against Hatred,” this Saturday.

Oursler ' said the coalition wants to
encourage the conrrnunity to talk about
diversity and build a stronger respect for
diversity, not clash with the Klan. He said
that confrontation is exactly what the Klan
wants and exactly what the Market Street

g rally will deny them.

“We want, in the Market Square rally,
to be talking positively,” he said, “not just
saying ‘No’ to the Klan, but saying ‘Yes’ to
the community’s recommitment to ﬁghting
racism, homophobia, anti—sernitisrn, and all
of the things that the Klan’s hateful mes-
sages attac .”

town area, agreed that it is the message of
the Klan, and not the Klan itself, that the
city is up against.

“What’s with this thing is not the Ku
Klux Klan  but the ideas that the KKK
embodies, such as irrstitutionalism and
political and inter—personal racisrrr,” said
Udin.

According to Oursler, the only thing
being burned at this rally will be the idea
that diversity cannot be discussed rational-
ly.

Pittsburgh police officials said security

will be tight. Officials added that approxi— .

mately 200 city olﬁcers —— backed by
county police and sheriff’s deputies — will

be on hand to maintain order. ‘xi
Udin commented earlier‘ this week that 

the Pittsburgh police has contacted cities
that have hosted similar rallies and dis-
cussed control measures.

‘”The potential for danger is minimal,”
said Udin, and he complemented the “pre-
paredness” of the entire Pittsburgh police
force.

Talking it out

While the Klan speaks to its down-
town audience, the anti—rally will be hosting
some speakers of it’s own. Over 50 of
them. ‘

And instead of watching the crosses of
the Klan, the Market Square crowd will be
watching the sticks of bands, drum corps,
and choirs.

Oursler said speakers will represent
every facetlof American society and will
continue ttrrouglrout the day. Even Mayor
Tom Murphy is slated to appear and speak
out against the Klan’s message.

“People who are ﬁghting over other
issues are uniting over this,” said Oursler.

The anti-rally, said Oursler, will be
entirely peaceful, safe, and a place of dis-
cussion and entertainment.

“Families will feel comfortable bring-
ing their kids to [Market Square],” said
Oursler. He described a section of the area,
called “Kid’s Comer,” which will have
clowns, games, and activities for children.

But not all the activities at Market
Square will be for the kids. Oursler said he
has organized a “peace sheet” project.

The sheets will contain signatures and
people’s “written commitments to their
peacefully working for change.”

Oursler said the coalition is doing this «

Report ranks research above teaching, says faculty -

THE P|'l"I' NEWS

NEWS A POINTED LOOK AT THE UNIVERSITY ,

hursclay, April 3, ‘I997

Administrators claim non-tenure professors can focus on educating undergraduates

q__Cesca Antonelli

Most administrators and department
chairs agree that budget cuts will improve
undergraduate education by including more

A students in faculty research, but some say a

focus on research relegates teaching to sec-
ond place.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences budget
proposal, submitted last week, will reduce
faculty size ﬁom 550 to about 505 and will
lower the number of teaching assistants by
70.

Administrators say that these cuts, com-
bined with the curriculum review currently
underway, will make the undergraduate
experience at Pitt better.

But some professors have raised ques-
tions about the possible negative effects of an
increasing emphasis on research on good
teaching.

“I think a guiding principle the [report]
tries to articulate is the complicated relation-
ship between teaching and research, but they
always say ‘research and teaching,”’ said
Dennis Looney, the chair of French and
Italian. “That kind of equation suggests that
one of the activities is more important than
the other.  Teaching seems to get a subordi-

in FAS” is the facul-
ty’s commitment to
research. The second
is ﬁnding new ways
to turn faculty
research to the bene-
ﬁt of undergraduates.
Neither of the other
two principles men-

tions the word
“teaching.”
David Brumble,

associate dean for
undergraduate stud-
ies, said education will not suffer by replac-
ing the tenure-stream faculty with non-
tenure-stream, teaching—only positions.

‘Talk about improving undergraduate
education, these are people being hired pre-
cisely because of their qualiﬁcations as
teachers,” Brumble said.

Of the 550 faculty spots in FAS, only
537 are ﬁlled now. When that number drops,
25 non-tenure-stream positions will be
added. Dean Peter Koehler said he did not
expect any problems integrating the new fac-
ulty.

“We have to be careful in the long term
that, as the tenure-stream faculty number

 

goes down, that we. bring , in non—tenure
stream positions in a timely way, so that we
do not sulfer any loss of teaching capacity,”
Koehler said.

“There will be a shift of resources ﬁorn
the graduate to the undergraduate programs.
There’s a certain number of positions that we
are creating for teaching—only positions. It’s
hard to say exactly what percent of the cours-
es per se. [But] I would not call it a large
shift.”

Brumble spelled out four options that
were open to FAS, given its budget con-
straints. First, he said, the size of classes
could have been increased. “That’s just unac-
ceptable,” he said. '

Second, the number of part-timers could
be increased. .

“There are some problems with that,”
Brumble said ‘There is a sense of commu-
nity within departments when people are
staying here. You don’t want to ﬁll all [the
open positions] with part-time instructors.”

Third, teaching loads of research-active
professors could be increased.

“The current teaching load, it varies, but -

is two maybe three courses per semester,”
Brumble said. “You could make it three
maybe four courses per semester, but you’d
ﬁnish this place as a research university.

r. nate role, and when “What’s left?
that happens, the You can keep

the most.” ty at their present

In the proposal, teaching levels  and
the first “guiding bring in some people
principle for planning to be teaching special-

ists. Then you’d be
hiring good under-
graduate teachers and
allowing faculty to be
research-teachers.
That’s a pretty good
solution.”

N o n - te n u r e -
stream positions will
come in the form of
senior lecturers who
do nothing but teach
and
degree positions. for
recent Ph.D. grads to use as stepping stones
for their careers.

The deans do not know which type of

‘position will be most common.

“We deﬁnitely have a preference for
teaching post-docs,” Koehler said. "Ihe very
important difference is a teaching post—doc is
a person for whom this is a career step from
teaching here to possibly teaching at another
university.  We get them when they’re
young and full of energy. Hopefully when
they leave, they’re still full of energy and
have more experience.”

However Brumble said he preferred the
senior lecturers, who have more teaching

post—doctoral,

experience.

The decisions about how many such
positions are created in a department will be
made at the same time decisions a ﬁnalized
within the next two or three years. The choice
of individuals hired will be left to the depart-
ments. ~ -

Looney said that he did not think
increasing the number of non-tenure—strearn
faculty would hurt education, as long as the
newcomers were not focused in one area.

“The replace-
ments  do not neces-
sarily mean they
won’t be good teach-
ers, but suggest the
plan focuses more on
one of those activities
than the other,”
Looney said. “[T'hat]
will be especially true
if the replacement  is
all in one department,
one division, one sec-
tion of FAS. If you
focus [them] in only a
few departments, then
you are suggesting
that those depart-
ments should be
involved in that sub- '
ordination of teach-
ing.”

The proposal said that the freed money
will support faculty research’ and conference
endeavors, but that Looney said he would
like to see some of it go toward instruction.

“Are wesopoorly supportedinourpro-
fessional activities? Why are undergraduate
issues second to that?” he asked

Other chairs expressed concern that the
number of faculty would not be high enough.

- “In our case, it reduces the number of
professors available to teach courses,” said

Raymond Owen, chair of political science. .

“It makes the ones, who remain here a lot
more tense and a lot more busy, but apart
from that, I don’t see any major changes. If
we can get up to our full complement of fac-
ulty, we’ll be alright. We’re currently below
that, and we can’t get authorization to
recruit.” ’

Difficulties facing improvement
Supporting undergraduates in an urban
university is not easy, according to Brumble.
According to Brumble, Penn State’s 35,000
undergraduates mean that if faculty don’t sat-
isfy the students, they go under, he said. By
contrast, Pitt only has 8,550 undergraduates.
“On the other hand, we have a small
number of undergraduates and a huge
research establishment,” Brumble said. “A
chemistry major who wants to work in a
research lab on a real, honest-to-goodness
research project can do it, and it’s precisely

because we have a small undergraduate col-
lege and a huge research establishment.”

Brumble said that administrators were
convinced that Pitt needs to do more for
undergraduates.

“[But] it’s very hard at an urban univer— '

sity,” he said. “At Penn State, if you want a
new undergraduate dorm, you take out a
cornﬁeld. At Pitt, you can’t do that.”

Despite conﬂicting views on a number
of issues related to paying for improvements,
professors and
administrators seem
to agree that Pitt is
making progress.

“I would say the
document reinforces
the concern in the
college for under-
graduate education,”
said Stephen
Coleman, chair of
theatre arts. “I’m

very optimistic.”

Curricular needs

One work-in-
progress touted by
administrators is a
review of the under-
graduate curriculum
in hopes of streamlin-
ing graduation requirements without sacriﬁc-
ing education. .

"Ihere’s a strong sense that the current
set of requirements are too complicated,”
Koehler said. “[What] we’d like to‘ do is
achieve the same ends, but not have quite so
many hoops to jump through.”

Koehler said that review would establish
the aims of each requirement and refocus
them

In October, Brumble sent a list of gener-
al questions to departments about the cours-
es they offer and suggestions they had for
getting undergraduates more involved in
their studies. »

The proposal also stressed the impor-
tance of the review. “We will be more ﬂexi-
ble and creative in oifering students curricu-
lar choices that serve their individual needs.”

Even critics of the emphasis on research
said that the report does address some under-
graduate concerns. “[That] does address
issues the provost raised,” Looney said. .“We
do need to think about what it is students
need and want.”

Koehler said that he hopes some
changes would begin in the fall.

“We’re now analyzing [the responses]
and then forming a number of faculty com-
mittees clustered in the appropriate areas, so
that they’ll be in place by the fall to pursue
the questions from the ﬁrst round,” Koehler
said.

PLASMA FRACTIONS FOR QUALITY BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS

 

Very few people attended Tuesday's ”Town Hll Meeting"

   

 

held by the sea.

Concerts at Pitt impossible
without venue, says PPC

 

Do students really want big name
bands at Pitt, or would they be satisﬁed with
-lesser known artists?

This question sparked the debate at
Tuesday, night’s ‘Town Hall Meeting.”
Few students attended as SGB and Pitt
Program Council discussed the future of
concerts at Pitt, and what it would take to
open campus venues to musicians.

In years past, concerts were held on
campus at buildings such as the Syria
Mosque, now a parking lot, and David
Lawrence Hall. Because of safety issues
and other concerns, concerts are no longer
held in campus buildings.

Tom Misuraca, assistant director of the
Pitt; Program Council, was there to answer
questions and explain why big—name con-
certs are no longer held on campus.

The Fitzgerald Field House is the only
Pitt venue big enough for a concert, but
according to Misuraca, it’s unavailable

because athletes need it for practice.

Besides availability, there are other
drawbacks in having a concert on campus.

“Unfortrmately you are in a metropoli-

tan market,” Misuraca said sarcastically.
‘ ‘Meaning you have people here who put on
[concerts] for a living.” He said Pitt is com-
peting with them ﬁnancially over who can
host which bands.
, But Misuraca said living on a city cam-
pus also provides students with a lot of con-
cert options that smaller, more niral schools
don’t have. -

Ed Traversari, concert promoter for
DiCesare Engler, also spoke at the meeting.
He agreed that Pitt does not have the facili-
ties for a large concert

Traversari said Pitt is not unlike other
universities which have limited availability.
Penn State used to be lirrrited, but solved the
problem by building a multi—purpose build-
ing. Pitt has plans for a similar building, but
at this point financial problems have
delayed construction for several years.

Bigelow task force leader

, Thursday, April 3, I997

angered by student apathy

The student heading the campaign to
shut down Bigelow Boulevard said she is
ready to give up unless students start show-
ing nrore interest. ‘

SGB member Jennifer Molluso said
student apathy and indifference have
negated all her efforts _to close the street
and create a more uniﬁed campus.

Yesterday" seven SGB members stood
in front of the William
Pitt Union yesterday
encouraging students to
show City Hall a strong
voice for the closing of
Bigelow Boulevard,
but few students
showed any interest. A .
yellow school bus
draped with rallying 3
“Close Bigelow” signs 3
waited nearby to carry 
them downtown to -a 
protest outside the ‘city- 5
council building.

SGB V members 
were protesting the 
compromise made by 
Pitt administrators and 
Mayor Tom Murphy V
last month which 
would keep the road 
open but reduce it to 
two lanes. Molluso said 
she wanted to keep 
ﬁghting until the city 
closed the road com-
pletely.

Turnout for the protest has caused her
to reconsider.

The “crowd”. at 11 a.m. totaled close
to nine students, with SGB members
shouting, “Where’s the student body?” The
yellow school bus remained nearly empty.

 

“We need more people,” said
Molluso, “People know about it, but I
guess it’s hard because students have class-
es.”

Though few would participate in the
protest, many students walking by said
they would like the road closed.

But the problem yesterday was that
there wasn’t enough of these student voic-
es present at City Council, according to
Molluso.

Only Molluso’s voice represented the I

student body at the meet-
ing, holding up signed
petition cards and telling
Councilmen, “this issue
isn’t dead. We will come
back.”

“People are always ask-
ing, ‘What can we
change?’ but where are
they?” Molluso adds, “if
we don’t support impor-
tant issues, show a voice
or come together, nothing
will change.”

Molluso went on to say
that she and the Task
Force need to decide if
they’re going to continue,
due to the students’ lack of
interest. Tentatively, if at
least 25 people can be
gathered, she would like
to try to hold a public
hearing over‘ the next
week.

Because the end of the
semester is approaching,
though, students will have one more
chance to rally sometime next week.
Otherwise, the issue will be dropped.

“There needs to be many things decid-
ed,” Molluso said. “There needs to be
more busloads of students to City
Council.”

Professors fear UPMC goals may conflict with University's

As the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center System
continues to expand, Pitt professors
fear its goals may stray from the
educational goals of the University.

At Tuesday’s Faculty
Assembly meeting, Professor
Keith McDufﬁe announced the
fomtation of an ad hoc committee
to look into the relationship
between UPMCS and the
University, particularly the School
of Medicine.

On the same day, UPMCS

announced the completion of a
merger with Shadyside Hospital.
According to McDuﬁ'1e, many
faculty members are concerned
that UPMCS’ goals of doing busi-
ness in a competitive market may
not be consistent with the educa-
tional goals of the University.’
“This is not to say that the two
organizations are not compatible;
the task of the committee is to gath-
er and assess infomiation that is
relevant to the extent of the com-
patibility of UPMCS and the
University,” McDufﬁe said.
“Perhaps the comrnittee’s
effort will also encourage the

University administration to look
more closely at this time at the
UPMCS-University relationship
and its long-range implications,”
he added.

Professor Nathan Hershey of
the Graduate School of Public
Health agreed.

“There has generally been the
feeling that University interests are
not going to be protected as
UPMCS goes on with its mission,
that inadequate attention is given to
the educational goals of the
University,” said Hershey, who
will chair the new committee.

“But I don’t feel the chancellor

and the provost have given much
attention to the potential conﬂicts
of interests. Hopefully, this will get
their attention,” he added.

Hershey cited UPMCS’s
merger with Shadyside Hospital as
a perfect example of the kinds of
things the committee plans to look
into.

“If cases that may have been
referred to medical school special-
ists are now referred to the
Shadyside specialists, that is going
to have a serious impact on the
School of Medicine,” he
explained.

“How important are the rev-

enues of UPMCS to the School of
Medicine? There’s the feeling that
we are not given much informa-
tion, so those are the kinds of things
we want to bring to the ﬂoor.”

Hershey said he has begun the
process of asking faculty members
to serve on the committee. He
hopes to eventually recruit seven or
eight members.

“I’ve talked to several people,
and I am very encouraged by the
response I am getting,” he said.

“Last month’s University
Senate discussion of health care
beneﬁts really raised a lot of ques-
tions in people’s mind.”

KKK 

most of it,” Foster said of the peace rally
movements.

“I think they are asinine. I think they are
stupid. I think they are ignorant,” he said. “I
think it’s tenible that they get so many of
these queers and queer groups to speak out
[against the Klan.]”

Foster ranted about the idea of uniﬁed

, peace marches led by Councilman Sala Udin

into Market Square.

“If those goddamn niggers come down
that street then we’re gonrrado that [also],” he
said.

He arguedthatthecity was being unfair-
ly biased in not granting the.Klan a permit to
march through certain sections of town,
including Homewood.

Pittsburgh zone six police say this was
done for the Klan’s own safety, but Foster

“Just because it’s good for one,” he said,
“it’s gomra be good for the other.”

Foster said the city has done it’s best to
stiﬂe the~Klan’s rally, but he has used the First
Amendment, the Constitution, and the courts
to grant constitutional equality to his Klan.

But opponents say he’s just exploited

them.

Dark views, white power

Foster explained the views of the
American Knights as calmly as though he
were explaining the directions to a gas sta-
tion. His voice droned as he probed into the
depths of Klan philosophy.

“My goal -—— our goal — is that we put
the right people who ﬂrink white and act
white [in oﬂice],” he said, expressing his dis-
gust at Jewish and black political oﬂicials, in
particular. ‘This is how far  morality has
slipped in America.

“You guys would say we’re the worst for
bringing morality back to America, [but] rev-
olution is not rrrade by saints. I sure as Hell
ain’t no saint, but that’s not what it’s all about.
It’s about white revolution.”

Not only does Foster say turning the
KKK into a political machine is possible, but
claims it’s already happening. ‘

At lower levels of the government and in
various areas, Fosterclairnstlre KKKalready
has politicians in place. He said the Klan‘ is
keeping them under a cloak of secrecy “until
the time is right”

He made it clear in his conversation that
there is no room in the KKK’s conceptual-
ization of America’s future for anyone but
white Christians.

. He said there is no roonr for “niggers,
nigger—lovers, loin-licking lesbians, commu-
nists  and Zionist Jews” in his America

According to Foster, his faction of the
Klan is prepared to go to extremes to ensure
white power and white separation.

“If we have to break up the country, then
that’s what we’ll do,” said Foster. “Ifwe have
to partition off part of the country eventually,
then we’ll do that.”

He said that this rally will “put the cred-
ibility back in the [KKK].”

Increasing the Klan’s size and political
sway is only one part of Foster’s racist vision.
He said the rally also stood forthe civil rights
and constitutional guarantees of the Klan’s
membership.

' “We want to come down [to Pittsburgh]
to exercise our civil rights,” said Foster.

‘Mark my words: Five years from now,
we’re going to be very lucky as a country if
we maintain the First Amendment  We
rrright not lose it, [but] we’re gonna come
damn close to it,” he said.

get their voice across to America, and Foster
willingly elaborated.

He said distributing KKK white
supremacy pamphlets —— “bundles of joy,” as

he referred to them —— is another means of ,

spreading their message.

“When we drop 2,000 to 5,000 pieces of
literature [in an area], we impact a lot of peo-
ple with that  man, it’s effective.”

Stabbed, shot, blown up 

Foster proudly described his faction of
the K, the American Knights, as a
“Rockwellian confrontational group.”
Regardless of the opposition on Friday, he is
ready to get in Pittsburgh’s face. -

“I’ve been stabbed, shot, blown up,
rippedupwitlrbarbedwire...hadacid
thrown on me, the shit beat out of me with a
baseball bat, and I don’t fear for my life,” said

Foster. “If Jesus Christ feels it’s time for me i

to come home, then it’s time for that chariot
to pick me up.”

People’s hate, said Foster, is his fuel and
he loves it.

“I thrive on [hate]” said Foster. “It’s what
makes my motor run and what trips my trig-

get.

sheets than to put them over your head.”

The United Way will also be handing out
commitment cards which Klan opposers can
carryhomeandplaceinavisibleplaceasa
daily reminder of their anti-hate vows.

And some Pittsburghers will be bringing
their vows to Market Square en masse and
on foot. Udin has organized two marches in
peaceful protest of the KKK’s rally.

One march will begin in from Freedom
Comer (at the intersection of Centre Avenue
and Crawford Avenue.) From there it will
proceed down Centre Avenue, move onto
Fifth Avenue, and proceed to Market Square.

The other will start in West Park, cross
the Sixth Street Bridge, and likewise end up
in Market Square.

“A lot of organizations ﬁght racism
every day,” said Udin. “This gives them a
renewed sense of unity of purpose in coming
together against the Klan.”

 

FROM PAGE 7

Another organization, the Grant Street
Coalition, will be the only organized group to
appear before City—County building, separat-
ed from the Klarrsmen by a six—foot high
fence.

Nevertheless, the group will hold a silent
protest in the face of the Klan’s storming
message. ‘

Joel Thomas is the president of New
Youth Culture — one of the 14 coalition
organizations facing the Klan.

“Whether we were there or not, there
was going to be people  said Thomas.
“We’re there fora peaceful process.”

The Grant Street Coalition will be
stalling a force of “peace marshalls” to make
sure everything and everyone stays under
control. He said the best way to get their mes-
sage to the Klan will be to stand silently bear-
ing a message of peace to extinguish the ﬁre
of their hate.

 

Udin said the Grant Street Coalition’s
job is admirable, but still encouraged people
to attend the Market Street rally.

“Ithinkthatitwillbebetter[toattend
Market Square],” he said. “But not to be crit-
ical of those who will confront the KKK on
Grant Street. It doesn’t bother me one bit to
have a group doing this. We need both.”

Healing the Hole

Oursler said the Market Square rally is
not directed against the Klan, but it is direct-
ed against the Klan’s “victim-blarning
approach” to answering its problems.

“[The Klan] is looking for an immediate
answer,” he said, “not ‘How do we work
together to overcome our problems.’”

The Klan, said Oursler, is small itself and
only seeks a very small segment of the popu-
lation, but then makes itself seem as though it
is enormous.

“It’s their comfortableness with hatred
that makes the Klan come in,” he said. “They
are actively committed to working for the

low percentage of the population that
believes the hatred.”
According to Oursler, the Klan’s mes-

sage is contradictory in many senses of the

word

‘They have lots of interest in their own
rights, and no interest in anyone else’s rights,”
he said “['Ihe KKK] wants to get rid of
everybody who doesn’t agree with them.”

Buttlre visit ofthe Klan may be more of
a hindrance than a help for their cause.
Pittsburgh businesses and citizens are coming
together more strongly than they have in th
past several years, said Oursler. . '

He said he sees this as the kick that anti-
prejudice organizations within the city need-
ed to build themselves and the motivation a
lot of people needed to get involved in such
organizations.

‘This must continue after the rally,” said
Oursler. “It’s only the beginning of a lot of
work.”

Still, Oursler said he thinks Pittsburgh is
ready for the challenge.

Concerts

Traversari said what holds schools back
is the cost.

How much would a concert cost Pitt?

According to Misuraca, the ﬁxed con-
cert expense estimate is $53,125. This price
includes things such as sound. lighting,
advertising, zmd catering but does not include
the talent which ranges from $35,000-
$50,()()(). I

“You can’t even get Rusted Root for
$35,000,” Misruaca said. “$35,000 gets you
an act on the way up.” He also added that if
the act was one that the students didn’t like.
then money is lost.

Ryan Weidenmiller, SGB member, dis-

 

agreed with Misuraca.

“It seems you already have it in your
mind it’s almost impossible to bring concerts
to Pitt,” Weidenmiller said. “It’s your job -
you have to ﬁnd ways to bring it to the
University.”

Misuraca’s response was, “Nobody
wants a show here more than I do.” He insist-
ed that Pitt just does not have the money or
the facilities.

Damon Hudac, a Pitt student, voiced
similar complaints. He said Misuraca was
being “narrow minded.” Hudac’s solution is
Pitt does not necessarily need “big—name con-
certs.” Hudac said, “There is a market out

there for smaller shows -— be more creative.”
Misuraca said from now on the Pitt

Program Council will look into smaller’

bands, but added that low attendance has
been the main problem with smaller shows in
the past.

Ethel Uy, lecture director for the Pitt
Program Council, announced at the meeting
there is a Special Events Committee com-
prised of 25 students who discuss what sort of
events should Pitt hold. Uy said students
should join and voice their concems. The Pitt
Program Council can be contacted for further
infomration on the committee.

Margot Douaihy, co—president of the
Campus Women’s Organization said, “I
think if you’re into smaller shows, you need
to check out what is happening on campus.”

She advised looking into what other organi-
zations besides the Pitt Prograrn Council on
campus offer.

Keltin Burgess, who is on the technical
staff at the Union, suggested concerts should

have general admission rather than floor seat-~

ing to increase the amount of people able to
attend. Burgess added a vote needs to be
taken to prevent fighting over what types of
bands should be here in the future.

Misuraca responded that general admis-
sion can’t really be done for safety reasons.
As to the vote, Misuraca said: “You will be
seeing some surveys from us coming the
beginning of next year asking about all dif-
ferent things — notjust music,” He added the
surveys would have to be researched so the
results can really be put to use.

. teams,”

Undergrads 

Brumble said that some of the sugges-
tions were already being acted upon. The
biology department suggested getting more
students into the labs by working out a deal
with the professional schools in the health
sciences. -

“We already have, especially [in] biolo-
gy, students in the
medical school labs,
but I’m hoping we
can do more,”
Brumble said.
Delvin into
researc

One concern,
according to
Brumble, is how to
expand research
opportunities in
humanities and social
sciences areas.

“The sciences
are situated better to
work in research
groups, working in
Brumble
said. “That is not the way most research
works in the humanities. Research in the
humanities tends to be fairly solitary. 
Getting students closer is going to be an
intriguing kind of question.”

Some programs have already started
widening opportunities. According to
Bnrmble, the communications department is
working up a research-internship for under-
grads to work with a faculty member on a
speciﬁc research project.

Koehler also said he wants to increase
the number of undergraduate teaching assis-
tant positions.

“I know that they use them in math,”
Koehler said. “We should encourage them in
other disciplines. The best way to learn is to
teach. [UTAs] not only are a valuable link
between undergraduates and the professors,
[but] they may [also] be more available in
dorms at odd hours.”

Brumble said that there will also be
more internship opportunities and ways to
get class credit for them.

“lt’s now going to be easier for students
to get sponsorship for internships in CAS,”
he said. “I’m going to serves as backup spon-
sor for students who can’t ﬁnd other spon-
sors.  We’ll still encourage students to look
for internships in their departments with fac-
ulty sponsors. But there has been a problem.”

Recruiting

Pitt has also started taking extra steps to
recruit “high—priority” students, those in the
top of their high school class with high SAT
scores.

Koehler said that zur important part of
improving undergraduate education is
improving the undergraduates themselves.

 

I Thursday, April 3, I997

“The difference [between Pitt and
Harvard] «is the students with whom you sit
in class,” Koehler said. ‘‘There’s not much
difference with the faculty.”

\Vrth the new recruiting system, profes-
sors and administrators call high schoolers at
home and talk about what they will be doing
at Pitt, answer ques-
tions, and encourage
students to come and
see the campus.

“We’re calling
these kids as though
they’re football play-
ers , and recruiting
them,” he said.

Brumble said
that most of Pitt’s
professional schools
have started guaran-
teed admissions poli-
cies.

“For super-
duper high school
students with a
record above a cer-
tain level and if they
rnaintainperformanceatacertainlevelatthe
University of Pittsburgh, tlrey’ve got guaran-
teed admission [to a professional school at
Pitt].”

A chance for input

While many students and professors
raise concerns about a lack of input into var-
ious University processes, Brumble said that
undergraduates have been involved in the
curriculum review.

“I’m very much interested in what stu-
dents have to say,” he said.

Brumble has had “several” meetings
with groups of students to talk about Pitt’s
general education requirements. According
to Brumble, earlier meetings have yielding
sorrre “interesting” results.

“There has been not a single dissenting
voice on the foreign culture requirement,” he
said. “People [also] seem to like the language
requirement. It’s not a very stringent lan-
guage requirement, but very few students
oppose the language requirement.”

Brumble said there has also been talk
about some kind of “core curriculum” that all
students would have to take, which would
include M—designated courses where stu-
dents would need to have demonstrated a
proficiency in math.

No decisions have been made about
new core requirements.

“Now the next step is going to be some
kind of committee structure to think about
this and a whole lot of talk in the faculty in
organized ways about this,” Brumble said.

We could more easily promote the

2. “This ‘is a hard one to call
because this is the first Division I
school I have worked at. I’ve been
around a lot of people involved with
major universities, though. I’ve
also had the chance to work with
top—level players. At Pitt, soccer is
new, so the sky is the limit. It
depends where we end up in the
order of time and money from the
University. Right now, I believe Pitt
is in the upper middle of Division 1.
Our football team is down, but our

1: “At this moment the biggest
problem has to be working through
the transition. We’re all waiting to
see where we can go with the new
era and with Steve Pederson’s
vision. There is a lot of faith up
here in him.”

2. “I really don’t want to refer to
the past, because we as a team
haven’t had a season under the new
leadership yet. However, I think our
program is very highly regarded.
We’re a Top 3 team in our district
and in the Top 40 in the RPI rank-
ings, and we’ve been those things
for the past 12 years. We’re not
highly visible due to the fact that
we compete at the same ‘time as Pitt
football and the Steelers, but we get
great support from the University
and from the Athletic Department.”

  
   
 

Kirk Bruce

1. “Keeping fan support and enthu-
siasm high is the biggest problem
facing the Pitt athletic department.
The same thing happens every year
with every school. It is paramount
on our minds.”

2. “I only know how it goes here.
The emphasis on competition seems
to be the same in football and bas-
ketball as at other schools. We don’t
have the new facilities to‘ show off
like those at Syracuse or Boston
College, though. The philosophies
are about the same. It is hard to
compare overall.”

Marian Cassidy Keen

Women’s Swimming

1. “I don’t know that you can nar-
row it down. I guess one of the
things that we are trying to do is
bring some money back into the
department. That’s not just for the
Athletic Department, either, that’s
for the University as a whole. We
have to have good alumni — both
athletes and regular alumni.”

2. “I’m excited about where we’re
going. We finished fourth in the Big
East, which is very strong, and we
were 27th in the country. Pitt is one
of the older facilities, but it’s still
one of the best on the East Coast.
The administration has been very
supportive. They’ve made great
strides to help us financially. It’s a
neat time to be a part of Pitt swim-
ming and diving.”

Ralph Willard

Men's Basketball

 

l. “The biggest challenge we face is
facilities.”

2. “Again, it all depends on facili-
ties. Good facilities improve regu-
lar student—body recruiting, too.
The better student athletes will
come with better health, athletic, or
school activities. Our program will
only be as good as the facilities that
draw the kids here.”

David Sobal

Asst. Track/ Field

 

1. “I think there are two main prob-
lems. The first is a lack of space for
the number of teams that the
University is trying to field. At this
time of year, the stadium is being
used by a lot of different people.
With women’s softball coming in,
it’s going to be even worse next
year. I hate to mention the other one
because I feel like it’s being
addressed a lot. I think we all need
to realize that just because things
have always been a certain way
doesn’t mean that it will never
change. To me, that’s what growth
and development is all about, insti-

'I'I-IE PITT NEWS

 

tutionally or individually.”

2. “A phrase we use here is standing
tall, meaning we want to be pre-
pared to compete. Track and cross
country are really one program, and
the program represents itself and
the University well. We don’t have
a full set of scholarships, and we
don’t have the best training facili-
ties, but we do well with what we
have?’

1. “The problem is one of image,
and of changing our image, our out-
look, our expectations. When you
get into a groove, it’s hard to get
out, and the Pitt athletic program
has been in a negative groove.
Change doesn’t happen overnight,
and our challenge is to change our
image by changing our attitude.
Then the attitude from outside
toward us changes as well. Another
aspect of that is fundraising.
Having the money to do things at
the top level comes hand-in—hand
With that.”

2. “Up here in the northeast, we’re
pretty good. The women placed
fourth in the Big East this year.
We’re pretty competitive among the
top group of teams. The men win-
ning the Big East demonstrates that
even more so. Nationally, we’re not
as good. Our focus and goal for
both the men’s and women’s teams
is to be more competitive on the
national level. We had two All-
American divers, and we got a male
and a female swimmer in the NCAA
championships for the first time.
Our focus is to keep moving in that
direction.”

Unlike the American League, the
race for the National League pennant
doesn’t appear to be as wide open. Most
insiders (and outsiders, really) believe
that the senior circuit is divided into two
parts: the Braves, and everyone else. For
the sake of the other 13 teams, here’s how
the National League stacks up for this
season.

 

Atlanta Braves -

For most of the winter, things were
pretty much status quo in Atlanta. They
tried to trade away Fred McGriff to free
up some salary-cap room, but were
unsuccessful. In the last two weeks, how-
ever, the Braves had some major shake-
ups, trading away David Justice and
Marquis Grissom in one deal, and
Jermaine Dye in another. In return,
Atlanta got the speedy Kenny Lofton

_ from Cleveland and budding stars

Michael Tucker and Keith Lockhart from
Kansas City. How this deal affects the
Braves will not be known until the sum-
mer is played out.

However, any talk-of Atlanta’s World
Series hopes begins and ends with the
pitching staff. It remains one of the most
formidable in recent memory and per-
haps in the history of the game. Greg
Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz
own six Cy Young Awards between them,
with Denny Neagle, who would be the
ace on any other staff, ﬁlling in as the
fourth starter.

Combine the superb pitching with a
lineup that includes McGriff, Lofton,
Chipper Jones, Ryan Klesko, and Javier
Lopez, and Atlanta still looks like the
team to beat in the National League.
Predicted finish: lst, N.L. East

Florida Marlins
Give credit to Marlins’ owner Wayne
Huizenga: He stops at nothing in trying to

/make his team a winner. This winter,

Huizenga went on the most impressive
spending spree in the majors, acquiring
not only talent such as Alex Fernandez,
Bobby Bonilla, Moises Alou, and Jim
Eisenreich, but also the best manager as
well, luring Jim Leyland away from
Pittsburgh. _

The hiring of Leyland gives Florida
the best possible chance of avoiding the
fate of other teams in recent history that
have doled out big money only to see
their teams lose just the same. After all,
the Marlins weren’t all that short on talent
to begin with. The lineup still includes
Gary Shefﬁeld, Jeff Conine, and Devon
White, and the addition of Fernandez to
the pitching rotation, already anchored by
Kevin Brown and Al Leiter, gives the
Marlins one of the best starting trios in
baseball.

Unfortunately, one of the only teams
that can beat Florida in the pitching cate-

I.: Land of the He

 

gory, along with some others, is Atlanta.
While this may keep Florida from win-
ning the division, look for this team to
make some noise in the playoffs.
Predicted ﬁnish: 2nd, N.L. East (N.L.
wild card) .

Montreal Expos

A few years ago, the Montreal Expos
were one of the up-and—coming teams in
baseball, leading their division in rnid-
August with an impressive collection of
young talent. Now, most of that talent is
gone —— punctuated by the departures of
Moises Alou and Mel Rojas this winter
-— but there is enough left over to get the
Expos headed back in the right direction.

The batting order will center around
Henry Rodriguez, Rondell White, and top
prospect Vladimir Guerrero, who was
impressive in his rookie season last year.
The starting pitching is a little thin, with
Pedro Martinez and Carlos Perez being
the No. 1 and 2 starters, respectively, and
the bullpen is virtually anonymous.

Although the Expos are still undeni-
ably young and slightly short on talent,
the one ﬁgure who remains a constant is
Manager Felipe Alou, and that should be

enough to keep Montreal above water
this season.
Predicted ﬁnish: 3rd, N.L. Central

New York Mets

Last year was supposed to be the
break-out season for the New York Mets,
one in which they would shake their
recent troubles and make a run at the
playoffs. Instead, the Mets continued on
their losing ways, at least 90 losses for
what seems like the 10th straight year.

Much of the blame can be placed on
the starting pitching, or lack of it. Young
arms Jason Isringhausen, Bill Pulsipher,
and Paul Wilson all had surgery of some
kind, but if all three can return strong this
year, the rotation should be solid with
Pete Harnisch, Mark Clark, and Bobby
Jones all competing for starting slots.

No "matter how the pitching plays
out, offense shouldn’t be a problem for
New York. Todd Hundley, Bernard
Gilkey, Carlos Baerga, and John Olerud
round out a strong batting order. Last
year’s rookie sensation Rey Ordonez
should be an asset on offense as well as
defense, which is his trademark.

Things look better for the Mets this
season than in recent years, but recaptur-
ing the glory days of the ‘80s is still a
long way away.

Predicted ﬁnish: 4th, N.L. East

Pliiladelplria mar...

This season, the torch seems to have

been passed from Pittsburgh to‘

1: PITT mews

and Home of the Braves

Philadelphia as the worst team in the
National League.

Mark Leiter and Mark Portugal,
along with the returning Curt Schilling,
provide some semblance of starting
pitching, and closer Ricky Bottalico is
coming off an all-star season.

However, there just isn’t enough
punch in the batting order for the Phillies
to produce runs on a consistent basis,
with Gregg Jefferies and Rico Brogna
being the only real threats. V

If there’s one thought that Phillies’
fans can cling to for consolation this sum-
mer, it’s this: At least they’re not the
Tigers. . .

Predicted ﬁnish: 5th, N.L. East

 

St. Louis Cardinals

The Cardinals were one of those
teams that didn’t deal much during the
off—season, but coming off of their first
division title in almost 10 years, it’s hard
to blame them.

Consider first the pitching staff. The

 

Benes brothers, Andy and Alan, combine

with Todd Stottlemyre, Donovan
Osborne, and possibly Danny Jackson to
make up a premier rotation. Backing
them up in the bullpen is Dennis
Eckersley, a sure Hall of Fame inductee
after he retires.

The lineup is an uncanny combina-
tion of speed and power featuring Ron
Gant, Delino DeShields, Ray Lankford,
Royce Clayton, and Brian Jordan. Hitting
around them will be Gary Gaetti, Tom
Pagnozzi, and, occasionally, Willie
McGee, who should all provide veteran
leadership along with consistent offense.

St. Louis appears to have few weak-
ness, if any at all, and if they can shake
the memory of last year’s ALCS collapse
against the Braves, they might be able to
extract some revenge come this October.
Predicted ﬁnish: 1st, N.L. Central

Houston Astros

A team that is coming off a collapse
of a different sort is Houston. The Astros
were the leaders in the race for the
National League’s wild-card playoff spot
until things fell apart. The feeling this
year in Houston is that they can finish the
job.

From an offensive standpoint, that
doesn’t seem to be out of the question.
The batting order is bolstered by Jeff
Bagwell, with Craig Biggio, Luis
Gonzalez, Derek Bell, and Pat Listach
hitting around the ‘94 NL MVP.

The rotation is where the Astros have

 

Thurday, April 3, ‘I997

 

the question marks. Sid Fernandez, who
is a tossup as to what he’ll bring in as a
starter, is added to an already shaky trio
of Shane Reynolds, Darryl Kile, and
Mike Hampton. If they play to their
potential, Houston can easily make a
another run at the wild card or even the
division title, if the Cardinals should fal-
ter.

If not, Houston should endure anoth-
er season in which they will be well
above average but just not good enough
to  the comer, which has become an
all-too-familiar theme.

Predicted finish: 2nd, N.L. Central

Pittsburgh Pirates

Over the course of the past four
years, no team has fallen as far as the
Pittsburgh Pirates. The team has been
stripped of almost all of its major—league
talent, and over the off—season the Pirates
lost what seemed to be their last hope for
recovery, Manager Jim Leyland.

Intrading away almost all of the vet-
erans for younger talent, however,

Pittsburgh has quietly been stockpiling

prospects. Rookie Jose Guillen has had a
spectacular spring training, Jason Kendall
looks to be a huge part of the future, as do
Jermaine Allensworth, Joe Randa, and
the already established Al Martin and
Kevin Elster. On the mound, the Pirates
need young arms Jon Lieber, Esteban
Loiza, Steve Cooke, and Jason
Christiansen to fulﬁll their potential, as
does John Ericks in the bullpen.

Maybe I’m crazy, or maybe there
was a little something special in the Pitt
cafeteria’s fried chicken yesterday that’s
blurring my common sense, but I think
that Manager Gene Lamont can bringthis
young talent together.’

Predicted ﬁnish and bold pick of the
century: 3rd, N.L. Central

Chicago Cubs

Last season, Chicago hung tough
with the eventual division-champion
Cardinals all the way through mid-
September. This season, the Cubs are
looking to take the next step, and it seems
as though they have mostof the pieces to
do so.

The batting lineup remains pretty
much the same as in 1996, with the likes
of Sammy Sosa, Brian McRae, and Mark
Grace serving as the main run producers,
but the loss of Luis Gonzalez does hurt a
little. The pitching staff looks above aver-
age with Kevin Tapani, Teny
Mulholland, Steve Trachsel, and Frank
Castillo in the rotation, and a huge hole
was ﬁlled in the bullpen with the acquisi-
tion of closer Mel Rojas.

Top to bottom, the Cubs don’t appear
to have many weaknesses, but year in and
year out, for some reason, they seem to
always get cursed with the worst of luck.
If they can avoid some of the disasters
that have plagued them in the past, look

for Chicago to ﬁnish a little higher.
Predicted ﬁnish: 4th, N.L. Central

Cincinnati Reds

Cincinnati spent much of the winter
searching for lower—level free agents,
players who might be able to help their
cause at much more reasonable prices
than most of the bigger names.

Ruben Sierra, who comes over from
Detroit, should add punch to a lineup that
features Barry Larkin, Hal Morris, Fred
McGriff, Deion and Reggie Sanders (not
related), and Eric Davis. Not bad, but the
pitching staff is all question marks with
Pete Schourek coming off shoulder
surgery. John Smiley, Dave Burba, Mike
Morgan, and probably Kent Mercker fol-

‘low him in the rotation.

This collection of talent would tear
through the National League in- a heart-
beat —— if this were 1990. In the end,
however, you get what you pay for.
Predicted finish: 5th, N.L. Central

 

Los

Everybody who follows baseball
knows the Dodgers’ proﬁciency for tum-
ing out rookies of the year. The past ﬁve
winners of this award have all worn
Dodger blue, which is a pretty good way
of measuring how they’re developing
their younger players.

In the process, Los Angeles has built
itself a top—ﬂight team. The lineup is
stacked with the excellent hitters Mike
Piazza. Eric Karros, Raul Mondesi, Todd
Zeile, Todd Hollandsworth, and Brett
Butler, who hopes to make a full recovery
from throat cancer. The rotation is one of
the best in the majors, featuring Ramon
Martinez, Hideo Nomo, Ismael Valdes,
Torn Candiotti, and Pedro Astacio. Todd
Worrell provides stability as the closer.

It seems the only thing that could
possibly keep the Dodgers from winning
the West is the absence of Tommy
Lasorda in the dugout for the first time in
20 years. If new manager Bill Russell can
handle all of the talent given to him, the
Dodgers should present a serious chal-
lenge to Atlanta in the race for the pen-
nant.

Predicted finish: 1st, N.L. West

San Diego Padres

Last year, the Padres were one of
baseball’s surprise stories, winning the
division for the first time since 1984.
However, they did so with a lot of their
players having career years, and the
chance of that happening again is never
that good, regardless of the team.

Nevertheless, San Diego does look
strong for 1997. MVP Ken Caminiti
should recover fully from shoulder
surgery, with Greg Vaughn, Tony
Gwynn, Steve Finley, and Rickey

 

'I'l-IE PITT NEWS

FROM PAGE 16

Henderson (if he decides to play) hitting
around him. The pitching staff is a little
shaky, consisting of Andy Ashby, Joey
Hamilton, Sterling Hitchcock, and
Fernando Valenzuela, who are all looking
to prove that the numbers they put up last
season weren’t ﬂukes. Trevor Hoffman is
an excellent young closer out of the
bullpen.

While the Padres certainly are still
talented, the Dodgers look to have too
much in their arsenal for San Diego to
repeat as division champs. However, if
they can avoid injuries, the Padres should
contend for the wild card.

Predicted finish: 2nd, N.L. West

Colorado Rockies

Offense will be no problem for the
Colorado Rockies this season. It never
really has been. What has always been
the problem in Colorado, and will contin-
ue to be this year, is pitching. Starting
pitching, middle relief, closers — you
name it, the Rockies don’t have it.

What Colorado does have is a batting
order that sends the ball out of the park in
a hurry. With the likes of Dante Bichette,
Larry Walker, Andres Galarraga, Ellis
Burks, and Vinny Castilla swinging for
the fences, along with Eric Young and
Walt Weiss, who will hit around them, the
Rockies will win many 12-10 games.
They will also lose many of those games
because their pitching staff is right up
there with Detroit’s (well, not quite).
Kevin Ritz and Bill Swift are the only
ha1f—decent starters, and there is nothing
at all decent about Co1orado’s bullpen.

Until the Rockies make a serious
attempt to patch up their pitching prob-
lems, they will continue lag behind Los
Angeles and San Diego in the battle for
supremacy in the West.

Predicted ﬁnish: 3rd, N.L. West

San Fruxisco Gialls

Remember when the Giants, fresh
off their acquisition of Barry Bonds, won
103 games and were kept from winning
the division and possibly the World
Series only by a late—season run of bibli-
cal proportions by Atlanta? Neither can I.

Nowadays, San Francisco looks just
like the Rockies — only without the
offense. Superstar Bonds is worse off
now than he would be if he were still in
Pittsburgh, with the likes of Darryl
Hamilton, Glenallen Hill, Jeff Kent, and
Jose Vizcaino expected to help carry the
load in the batting order. That doesn’t
seem all that bad, but combined with a
rotation that rests its hopes on the well-
traveled Mark Gardner, the questionable
William VanLandingham, and the
unproven Shawn Estes, the Giants are
cooking up a recipe for disaster.
Predicted finish: 4th, N.L. West

That’s how the teams in the ‘National
League look to fall into place in 1997.
Remember, you heard it here first.

Another tragedy in sports leaves us asking why

  

Before Monday I had never heard of
Shannon Smith.

Unless you follow sports religiously,
you probably hadn’t heard of him, either.

As a kicker for the University of
Hawaii, Smith was never cast into the
huge media spotlight like many student
athletes are.

It took a tragedy for the 20-year-old
junior, who would have celebrated his
21st birthday Tuesday, to ever make the
newspaper or television.

Over the weekend, Smith drowned
while attempting to save his coach’s 6-
year-old son, Cody.

In a Monday press conference, Fred
VonAppen, the Rainbows’ head coach,
said that Smith was part of a hiking trip
that included the VonAppen family and
several Hawaii players.

Smith and the rest of the group were
swimming at the Waipahee Slippery Slide
in Kauai when he and Cody went down
the natural slide.

Two minutes later, Smith was dead.

Smith wanted to show the group a
remote area of the island and, as
VonAppen stated, the terrain was very
rough. Everybody arrived at the water at
different times, with Smith and Cody

being two of the first.

“He and Cody got there first, so when
he came out, they went down the slide
together,” VonAppen.said. “I don’t think
Shannon knew how dangerous the water
was because he was used to it [being
calmer], but it was rough and swirling,
with a vicious current that sucked you
under.”

VonAppen’s wife, Thea, had been
taking pictures from a nearby cliff when
she realized that the two were in trouble.
She went down the slide to help, but was
also pulled under by the current.

Struggling to reach thesurface, Fred
VonAppen saw Smith hand Cody off to
Thea. Thea then passed her son to her
husband, who managed to pass Cody to

Tim Carey, another Hawaii player who
was standing near shore.

Thea VonAppen ﬁnally made it to the
shore safely, and Fred refused to get out
until everyone was safe. Chris Shinnick,
another player, yelled to VonAppen that
Shannon was gone and then attempted to
dive in, but the coach stopped him, wam-
ing him that the current was too powerful.

“I knew Shannon stayed in the water
only to make sure that we got out safely.
He could have swam to shore at any time.
I don’t know how he stayed up as long as
he did because he was in the center of a
whirlpool. He is a hero. You can’t say
enough about what he did.” '

This area had once been a major
tourist attraction, but it had recently been
closed to the public.

“No Trespassing” signs that sur-
rounded the dangerous area had been shot
full of holes by hunters and could not be
read.

Srr1ith’s body was pulled from the
water 90 minutes after the accident, and

he was pronounced dead at 1:02 pm.‘

Saturday. The medical examiner said that
Smith hit his head on a rock during the
struggle and was knocked unconscious.
In a day and age where athletes have
continuously put themselves in dangerous
situations with crime and drugs, it is rnis—
fortunes like this that hurt the sports world
and the lives of countless innocent people.
This spring, Sharmon Smith would
have battled Eric Hannum for the starting

place-kicking duties. Maybe he would 1

have gotten the chance to win an impor-
tant game in the WAC next year, but that
has all changed without notice.

The families affected by this tragedy
are asking themselves why this happened.
Students and players at the University of
Hawaii are mourning the loss of a fellow
student and teammate.

The toughest thing about isolated
incidences like this is that there are no
answers. There is no warning or ﬂashing
red light to catch someone’s attention.

There were no answers in 1972 when
Roberto Clemente passed away deliver-
ing food to needy people in Central
America. .

There were no answers when several
members of the Notre Dame women’s
swimming team were killed when their
bus crashed during a winter storm.

Over time, people will forget about
what happened to Shannon Smith, but the
VonAppens won’t be among that group.

Their lives have been changed. Every
time they look at Cody, they will think of
Sharmon Smith and what he did to save
their 6-year-old son.

Hopefully, they will be able to ﬁnd
some reasoning behind what happened.
Hopefully, they will ﬁnd a way to remem-
ber Smith at the University of Hawaii.

He certainly deserves it.

“He’s done a good job making the
plays in the middle of the infield,”
said Jackson.

‘As Crowley’s fielding percentage
rose to .932, his stolen—base total hit
double digits for the second year in a

row. His 14 in 1996 compare well to ‘

the 16 he registered in 1995, consid-
ering that he played in six fewer
games. His patience at the plate paid
off with 33 walks, fifth all-time at Pitt
in a single season.

His plate production stayed

steady as he hit .277, while collecting :

eight doubles and his first home run.
Over the summer, Crowley

 

THE PI'l"I' NEWS

 

played in a league in Philadelphia,
exercised regularly, and remained
involved in a rigorous weightlifting
program.

This season, Crowley’s last at
Pitt, he’s picked up his leadership
role on the team’.

“He’s definitely one of our lead-
ers,” said Jackson. “Sam’s a real pos-
itive inﬂuence on the team.”

“Being a senior, I bring leader-
ship to this squad,” said Crowley.

Crowley also feels that he con-
tributes consistent play offensively
and defensivelyto the team, which is
11-7 so far this season. He has high
hopes of Pitt making the Big East

playoffs in his senior year.

“I was lucky enough to be part of
a Big East champion team in 1995,”
he said, “and I want to help lead them
to that again.” 1

Crowley graduates this spring
with a political science and justice
degree. After that, he plans on going
home to Willow Grove and getting a
job with the FBI.
' Jackson wrapped up Crowley’s
stay at Pitt by saying, .“If someone
can come in and be part of a Big East
championship team, a nationally-
ranked team like we were in ‘95, and
do well in the classroom, that’s what
it’s all about.”

Rossum ’s Robots explores universal
  llienaes no cult would even dare Iouch

R.U.R.
Directed by Gwen Orel
Translated by Gwen Orel
and Martin Votruba
Pitt Theatre

Perhaps when Stanley
Aronowitz spoke about the
dangers of science and tech-
nology dehumanizing labor
and production a few weeks
ago in his pomo-science
debate with Alan Sokal he

had read Karel Capek’s
“R.U.R.” R.U.R., which
stands for Rossum’s

Universal Robots, is a play
about business, science, and
its consequent potential
evils. Capek, a Czech play-
wright writing in the 1920s,
has written a play about
what it means to be human
in the face of impending
forces like industrialism and
technological “progress.”
General Manager Harry
Domin (Brian J. Gill) of the
“R.U.R.” factory has a quest
for emancipating man from
the rigors and perils of man-
ual labor by creating robots
to do the kind of work that
shouldn’t be done by any
human being. The show

opens with Domin explain-
ing the workings of his per-
fectly efficient factory setup
to a comely lady visitor,
Helena Glory (Kirsten
Quinn). While the idea of
using robots who can’t feel,
think, or communicate
seems to fuel Domin’s pas-
sion for efficacious work,
Miss Glory seems to ques-
tion the idea. How can these
robots not feel? How can
they not be able to express
themselves? Domin’s team
of managers, Dr. Gall (Joe
Eberle), Mr. Fabry (Ian
Mallitz), Dr. Hallemeier
(Gabriel Davis), Alquist
(Jesse D. Scheck), and con-
sul Busman (Tim
Wisniewski), rush onto the
scene to advance the idea of
automated labor. Time goes
on, Glory and Domin get
married, and then, Whoo!
There seems to be a prob-
lem. The world, which
depends mostly on produc-
tion by the robot laborers,
seems to be shrinking under-
neath the grasp of Domin
and his gang. Children
aren’t being born anymore

since all the world needs are
robots! Robots have taken
over and have achieved soli-
darity! In dramatic gasps,
the remaining humans cling
to anything they can before
an almost sure death. What
will happen next?

Orel, in her program
notes, mentions that, “In a
time where cloning is possi-
ble, ‘R.U.R.’ asks us, ‘What
does it mean to be human?”’
When today’s world exists

 

in terrifying realities such as
multinational export labor
corporations, mad scientists
groping to “create” life, and
the sick imperialism
advanced by the sinister
operations of the World
Bank and the IMF, it is
indeed a pertinent question
to ask. “R.U.R.” at the least
affirms the fact that some
people are concerned for
humanity’s fate.

The set of the show was
dazzling, as designed by
undergraduate film-studies

Courtesy Ashley Wells

major Vanessa Briceno; a
montage of diaphanous
shapes overlooked the stage
of Domin’s sparsely deco-_
rated office. Brian Gill was
extremely likable as Harry
Domin; I enjoyed his ease
with the text and his occa-
sional funny asides.
Likewise, Kirsten Quinn’s
Helena Glory was strong
and assured. The robots’
styl_istic movements were
certainly clean. The entire
gang of managers was most-
ly entertaining. Gabriel
Davis was especially ingra-
tiating as the brash Dr.
Hallemeier. To the compa-
ny’s credit, the show blasts
off with a promising amount
of energy and poise.
However, the last act seems
to slip into an interminable
phase of melodrama. The
show is definitely to be
lauded for a noble attempt at
investigating pertinent
issues, and I will always
applaud a show that displays
any type of working—class
solidarity. The company,
however, perhaps overesti-
mates itself with an ending

act that is covered more with
cheese than anything else.

Regardless of the perils
of interminable last acts,
“R.U.R.” makes a bold
statement that challenges the
icy tentacles of capitalism
(under whose restraint we
are all subject) to at least
rethink what they have a
hold on.

NICK CAVE & 785 Bill} SEEBS

Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds

TheB0atman’s Call

Mute/Reprise

I don’t know of anyone who just casual-
ly listens to Nick Cave. Either you love his
work, and obsessively await the release of
each new record, or you don’t. Most Bad
Seeds fans bought The Boatman’s Call the
day it came out, so this review isn’t really
necessary. But just in case there are some
folks out there who haven’t yet been exposed
to the magic of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,
or haven’t quite decided whether or not to
sign on board the Cave ship, here’s the scoop.

The Boatman’s Call is easily the qui-
etest, most contemplative record that this
band has put out, especially in recent years.
After last year’s blood—soaked Murder
Ballads opus, a collection of dark love songs
seemed to be in order.

The most obvious comparison to make
regarding Nick Cave would be with Leonard

'I'I'IE PITT NEWS

 

Cohen, who ‘Cave obviously holds inihighn

regard. Like Cohen, he has the same tenden-
cy to win the listener over with borderline
self—indulgent lyrics which smack of POET-
RY and walk that thin line between beauty
and cliché, inspiration and repetition. I think
that for most people, the inspired beauty
comes through clearly and is triumphant.
That’s why we listen to Nick Cave, and
that’s what we’ve come to expect.

Ever since the days of his pre—Bad
Seeds outﬁt, the Birthday Party, Cave has
explored mythical and quasi—religious
themes with a mixture of reverence and sac-
rilege. On The Boatmanis Call, he is more
reverent than ever; certainly he is more rev-
erent than on Murder Ballads. Apparently,
his marriage recently dissolved. That’s
enough to call for a bit of introspection. Cave
didn’t write any ﬁctional tales of debauchery
for this record; the songs are more personal
than they ever have been, and the instrumen-
tation is much more sparse. Last year Cave
respectfully declined MTV ’s nomination of
him for “Best Male Artist,” saying his art is
too personal for the competitive arena of
MTV award shows. Ifhe considered Murder
Ballads to be personal, I’d hate to hear what
he thinks of this one. It is sober, reﬂective,
and tragic. It is wonderful.

As with many of their albums, Flood is
co—producer, and, as with the other new
Flood production, U2’s Pop, Anton Corbijn
took the cover photos. For the ﬁrst time,
Cave looks old, weary. This is because
Corbijn’s poriraits capture life as it is, both
glamorous and transitory, and then freezes it

for examination, all the way down to the
pores. The music on The Baatmans Call
further emphasizes this image of Cave bear-
ing the weight of the world, only the world
whose weight he bears is his own personal,
internalized world, full of his own demons
and deities.

’Musically, I am reminded of the sparse-
ness of Palace’s Arise Therefore album, if
only due to the presence of the occasional
Casio beats, organ, and the fact that both Will
Oldham shares Cave’s fascination with
Leonard Cohen. Mick Harvey, Blixa
Bargeld, Thomas Wydler, Conway Savage,
Martyn Casey, Jim Sclavimos, and Warren
Ellis are all stars in their own right, and under-
stand the importance of minimal arrange-
ments. Very seldom does the whole band
play on any given song, and there is much
instrument—swapping. The ﬁrst track, “Into
My Arms,” features simply Cave and Casey
in a vocal/piano/bass spiritual love triangle.

The Boatman’s Call is a great record,
and is much more satisfying, in my humble
opinion, than Murder Ballads was. Where
the last album was an over-the—top, all—star
onslaught of violence and beauty, The
Boatmans Call is a solitaryexamination of
the relationship between one individual and
another, one soul and another, one spirit and
another. It seems to be evidence of a rnatura—
tion process for the artist in question. Let’s
just say that after all these years, Nick Cave
seems to be not growing up, but growing
within.

U2

Pop
Island

The mainstream music press has been
gushing with anticipation of the impending
release of this album for the past few
months, and since it came out, their ooohs
and aaahs have been splashed next to the
band members’ collective New Haircut. The
word is that this is the “new U2,” and things
will never be the same again. Bono has pro
claimed that “what we’re trjdng to do is play
a kind of music that hasn’t been invented yet.
And that’s a scary thing.”

Bullshit.

Pop is the same lame ultraproduced
garbage that this band has been putting out
since it read the reviews and critical back—
lash in response to their double album/ﬁlm
ego—soaked extravaganza Rattle and Hum.
The band’s sound and image (the two
things are inseparable, aren’t they?)
changed, and supposedly Bono and the
boys developed a sense of irony. Achtung,
Baby proved that they could be as shallow
as they wanna be, and Zooropa proved 
well I don’t know what the hell that whole
mess was supposed to prove. Oh, and of
course I can’t forget that commercial they
produced for Batman Forever: Boy, was
that a great tune.

So now the publicity machine known
as U2 has approached the world with
another grand, bloated attempt at a master-
piece. I receive the CD in the mail. I put the
disc in the player. The first song,

“Discotheque” (a “smash hit,” as the stick-
er on the CD tells me) reminds me of a
band that once tried to reinvent itself
because they were getting old and weren’t
relevant at all anymore (as if they ever
were), so they discovered dance music. I

think they were called U2.
The next song is even worse. and I can’t

’ keep myself from staring at the chest hair on
J the inside cover. Anton Corbijn is an incred-

ible photographer and ﬁlmmaker, and his
work helps provide U2 with just the package
they need to keep people buying their
albums. That’s why even I take a sort of sick
pleasure in seeing the videos he directs for
MTV (Nirvana’s “Heart Shaped Box” and
Rollins Band’s “Liar” come to mind), even
if they are for a band as shitty and predictable
as U2.

There is nothing radical or revolution-
ary about U2. When an old, unhip person
tries to be hip, the results can be disastrous.
Let’s call this disaster Pop. Once you get
past the slick, heavily layered mixes and
intense Flood production job, Pop reveals
itself to be more of the same Bonomania
that has characterized every U2 album. If
you like U2, you’ll love Pop. I had to take
it out after the third song. By the time I lis-
tened to it again, I had come to terms with
the fact that I was gonna make it through
the damn thing whether I wanted to or not.
I’ll admit that I could appreciate some of
the sounds on this album, for the pure
grooviness of it. Flood has done great work
for great artists (Nick Cave and the Bad
Seeds) and great work for shitty artists
(Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails).
Much of Pop is derivative of the latter two
projects.

If~you are really interested in Pop cul-
ture, and want to learn more about why U2
is one of the most evil bands in the history of
music, I strongly suggest you buy the Bay
area multimedia collective Negativland’s
book/CD entitled The Letter U and the
Numeral 2, which explores in-depth the cir-
cumstances surrounding Island Records’
lawsuit against Negativland in response to
their now-unavailable album called U2. This
book will set you straight on just what kind
of “creative artists” U2 are. Otherwise, if you

' don’t want to think too hard, and are simply

lookin’ for a good time, go ahead and com-
plete your U2 collection.

Veruca Salt
EightArms to Hold You
Outpost/DGC

Veruca Salt continues to baffle music
listeners with their sophomore album Eight
Amzs to Hold You. No one seems to be able
to ﬁgure out why a band with as little talent
as Veruca Salt acts like a big—time band.
Examples include their many references to
other bands (the title is the working title of
the Beatles’ Help.’ album), connecting their
different albums together through the lyrics
(“I told you about the seether before/you
know the one that’s neither or nor/well here’s
another clue if you please/the seether’s
Louise” sounds like they want listeners to be
part of a secret club or something), and their
new producer Bob Rock, who’s "worked
with the likes of Metallica and Motley Criie.

Their first album, American Thighs
(phrase from an AC/DC song), featured the
“Altemative Nation” hit “Seether,” thrusting
these hard—soft-hard—soft Chicago rockers
into the spotlight. Unfortunately, they lacked
the talent to carry any more catchy singles
off the album, so much so that no one even
noticed when they released their MI'V—punk
EP Blow It Out YourAss, Its Veruca Salt in
1995.

By 1997, all anyone remembered about
Wﬂly Wonka’s band was that the video for
“Seether” had a dog in it. In-the meantime,
though, Veruca Salt changed drummers and

   

picked up producer Bob Rock to bolster the A

Gen—X angst that all chick-rockers have
these days. The result: a heavier Veruca Salt
that shows its true roots in ‘80s pop rock

Eight Amrs starts the album off in just
the way they need to start it, heavier and with
a simple theme in the chicks-want—guys cat-
egory. “Straight” goes straight for the jugular
with Metallica—like riffs and a twisted
ambivalence to the title of the song. “You
need me more when you’re straight” and
“stay straight for me” will make the casual
listener do a double-take.

The next two songs, “Volcano Gir ”
and “Don’t Make Me Prove It,” add to the
question of ‘how good does this band think
they are?’ The ﬁrst one, their first single off
the album, should be titled “Seether 2,” with
similarsoundandtheexactsamethemeof
girls’ angst as their earlier single. “Don’t

Make Me Prove It” is big play on numbers A

and words that talented bands usually
attempt A

The album spends most of its time
remembering the ‘80s and" appealing to
teenagers. The song “Awesome” has ‘80s
pop—rock written all over it, including the
title, and ﬁnds Veruca Salt feeling rather
comfortable doing so.

“Loneliness is Worse” is the album’s
power ballad, beginning with an opening
that Aerosmith would have been proud of in
their ‘Angel’ days. “I ’m drawing a line/I 'm
asking please/don't you want to be happy
with me” brings back the days of daddy-
chaufeurred eighth-grade dances.

“\Vrth David Bowie” should be the
‘Friends’ theme song, displaying poppy gui-
tars and phrases like “you betcha” through-

Sounds:

out. The lyrics are simple but surprisingly
universal, since we all feel like we’re on a
personal level with a musician at times. “You
want me to sing/I can I can/You want me to
play/I can I can.”

Veruca Salt borrows more than just feel-
ings on this album, though. “Shutterbug”
sounds like a slow and whiny Def Leppard
song. “Stoneface” would be better sung by
Courtney Love or Liz Phair who would add
the charisma Veruca Salt never had. “Venus
Man Trap,” probably the best song on the
album, sounds like they got the Pixies to
play one of Sonic Youth’s psychedelic
pieces. The words aren’t too bad either, all
about what it takes to get a man.

The album’s ﬁnale,’Earthcrosser, goes
with their regular pattern of starting slow,
going fast then slow and few times, and end-
ing it up slow. The pattem is never more per-
tinent than in this song, all about the ups and
downs of touring the globe, written in four or
ﬁve-word phrases collaged together, like “I
hear the ocean/I hear the crowd/too pale too
sick too scrawny/but I’ll sleep here any-
way/and the sheets smell like bodies.”

Overall, the best Breeders’ tribute band
has beefed up their sound and twisted some
lyrics. While Bob Rock has given them an
edge, he’s shed a few layers, allowing us to
see who Veruca Salt really is: ‘80s hard rock-
ers in the mold of ‘90s grunge.

The Mighty Mighty Bosstones
Let’s Face It ‘
Mercury Records

\Vith the release of this Boston octet’s
sixth album, music store workers again ask
the question, “what kind of music is this?"
Some casual listeners would curtly classify
the Bosstones as ska, while ska purists (pre-
ferring original skankers such as The

Specials) would never want to be associated

 

 FROM PAGE 23

Traditionally, their albums have thor— A
oughly confused music lovers as to what ,

kind of music they play. Because of the con-

fusion, a new genre title was given to their .
style: ska-core. On Lets Face It, they contin— I’
ue their blend of ska, punk, hardcore, reggae, .;
and rock n roll. They also continue the I
Bosstones’ mix of political lyrics with crazy, "’

nonsensical lines.

The first song on Let’s Face It, “Noise 9

Brigade,” is a ﬁne piece of circus ska that

could get even the most two—left—footed per— ‘
son onto the dance floor. I feel the words in 

“Noise Brigade” may be the best on the
album, with tricky oombinations of phrases

such as, “I’ll go zero to sixty/And stop on a A
dime/A dime for a dozen/Ifthats what you ’re A

aﬁer” and “The end of the line ’sﬂVot the end.
of a rope/Just a salesman/Selling a bucket of
hope/When the bucket gets kicked/And my
chips are all cashedﬂlly intentions, conven-
tions/Are ﬁnally smashe ”

The title song, “Let’s Face It,” is also 215
zany circus of wiistafalls (the guitar riffs that

characterize ska) and a—beat—a—second lyrics I‘
with a psychedelic guitar middle ’(see also:'
Led Zeppelin’s “No Quarter”). The songs
tempo in “Let’s Face It” seems a little upbeat
for a topic as serious as racism and sexism. _,
Other social or political themes
espoused throughout the album include gang -
violence (“Nevemiind Me”), violence on TV
(“Desensitized“), marijuana use ("That Bug
Bit Me”), and the fallibility of Jesus (‘”l'he.
Rascal King”). . 1:
Throughout the messages being sung by

lead growler/screamer/occasioiial crooner _i
Dicky Barrett, one can never get away from _
the out-andcut diversity and fun found in 1.

their music.

“Break So Easily" starts with a powerful 9“

horn and drum combo which keeps up with
the lyrics. which bounce back and force

between chants reminiscent of the "ohee— "
  -t =   oh”s from the guards in I

  
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
  

with The Mighty Mighty   -.
Bosstones. The band i If
denies ties to ska, punk,
hardcore or any other musi-
cal genre, but actually has
links to all of them.

No matter what they
play, fans worldwide are
happy they started playing
“it” way back in 1985.
Unfortunately, they were
forced to break up in ‘86
for more than three years so
that guitarist Nate Albeit  
and bassist Joe Gittleman could ﬁnish high
school (Albert was 13 when he ﬁrst joined
the Mighty Mighty Bosstones).

After getting back together in 1989, they
released live albums in the same amount of
years: Devils Night Out, More ‘Noise and
Other Disturbances, Ska—Core, the Devil,
and More, Don’t Know How to Party, and
Question the Answers. In 1993, Don’t Know
How to Party gave the band its greatest suc-
cess, throwing them into the national spot-
light. 1995 was the band’s breakthrough year,
though. They performed on the Lollapalooza
tour, hosted MTV’s “l20 Minutes,” and
appeared in the movie Clueless.

    

Barrett’s growls.
“Desensitiz

songs,
speedy, sharp guitar work "
and harsh lyrics.’ But in

1- fashion, they found a way
 to throw reggae—ish swings
if and swaggers on the horns
into it. '

For those of you who like
something with more bite, “Nevennind Me”
zmd “Numbered Days” offer jaz7ed—up hard~
core tracks. If pure ska is your thing, so is
“Royal Oil," which provides every possible
rhyme for ‘oil’ and Bairett’s voice as deep
and as slow as it gets. “Another Drinking
Song” also provides a loungey, old—school
ska selection.

   

Whatever your tastes are (outside of Ace __
of Base fans), this album presents something‘ '
you’ll enjoy. If it’s crazy lyrics, large hem’ A

sections, punk rock guitar riffs, the straight:

forwardness of hardcore, or eight clad—in—<;“f‘
plaid lads skanking, Lets Face It will deliver; ,
