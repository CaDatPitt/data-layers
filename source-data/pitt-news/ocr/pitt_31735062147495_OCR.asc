Players To Give
‘Show-Off,’ Best
Domestic Comedy

 

Broun Applauds George Kelly’s
Farce, Cites Aubrey Piper’s
Typicality, N aturalness

“I might as well begin boldly and
say that “The Show-Off” is the best
comedy which has yet been written by
a.n American.” So sounds the daunt-
less voice of Heywood Broun, news-
paper columnist, author and critic,
concerning the comedy by George
Kelly, which will be ready for pro-
duction by Pitt Players November 13
or 14.

Of Aubrey Piper (the “show-off’,).
played by Joh11 Parks, BA36, Broun
says: “This man is no creature born
within the wings of the theatre. VVe
have sat desk to desk with him in
ofﬁces. He has bumped against us in
the subway and as like as not he lives
in the ﬂat just across the hall. He
has been wrenched out of life.”

“George Kelly builds up the case for
Aubrey Piper by countless small
strokes. By degrees he opens up the
heart of the man. There he stands——
liar, braggart, egotist——but the very
consistency of his faults colors them
With magniﬁcence. . From Prome-
theus down, mankind has chosen for
heroes men who stood pat. ‘Be your-
self, Mother Fisher!’ cries Aubrey to
his mother-in‘-law in times of stress,
and it is a slogan which he ha.s taken
to heart. There is no need for any-
one to say, ‘Be yourself, Aubrey!’
He never is tempted for a moment to
be anything else.”

Mrs. Fisher, irascible mother-in-law,
with all her nagging, is unable to
phase the indomitable Aubrey. She
has turned cynical. To her married
daughter, Clara, she opines; “There's
nothingcan be done by anything,
Clara—when once the main thing is
done. And that’s the marriage. Tha.t’s
where all the trouble starts—gettin’
married.” The role is being taken by
Carolyn Hall, Ed36.

Clara, married daughter, who suf-
fers from the inattention of her hus-
band, and idealizes_ the true attach-
ment between Aubrey and his wife.
Amy, will -be played -by Audrey Gra-
ham, C3_7. » Her romantic nature in-

clines "lit-fi“To“E>‘é‘"7t’c?léfé.7ii“t“of’-'th’e‘ “in.-mi’.

ferable Aubrey.

Frank Hyland is the husband of
Clara, and. one of the strong, silent
kind. Clara believes he was in love
before he met.her. On one occasion,
he adjured: “Always be kind, Clara,
to anyone that loves you; for a per-
son always loses what he doesn’t ap-
preciate. And it’s‘a terrible thing to
lose love.” John Weisbrod, C39, will
play the part. A

The role of Amy, wife of'Aubrey, is
being taken by Beverly Childress,
C36. It appears that she is somewhat
in love with her husband; she simply
adores everything he_does. . . _

Mr. Fisher,
house, and father of Amy, Clara and
the young inventor, Joe, is to be-
played by Ric_hard.Frankel, C_39. .Mr.
Fisher detests none quite_ so thor-

oughly as Aubrey, who has acquired ‘

the vicious habit of thumping him on
the back at every opportunity.-

Joe, conscientious brother of Amy
and Clara., whose bent runs to radio
and chemistry, will be played by Rob-
ert Madden, C37. In time, Joe proves
he has the stuff.

The characters of Gill. a working

man, and Mr. Rogers, an. insurance‘

salesman, are being taken by Chal-
mers Brown, Ed37_. and Raymond Mac-
Intyre, ‘ C38, respectively.

Chemistry Fraternity

Are Involved As

Former Professor, Editor Of ‘News’

‘America Speaks’

_Yesterday, in 40 Sunday newspa-
pers throughout the country, “Amer-
ica Speaks” made its debut.

Under the editorial management of
‘William S. Maulsby, former professor
and head of the department of jour-
nalism here, a.nd with John K. M.
Tibby, Jr., 35 and former editor of
The Pitt News, as an editorial asso-
ciate, the new syndicated project
boasts “a non-partisan scientiﬁc meth-
0d of making public opinion articu-
late on issues o-f the day.”

Dr. George H. Gallup, managing
director of the feature, nationally
famous in business and advertising
circles, wrote the lead article in yes-
terday’s issue dealing with govern.
ment spending for relief and recovery,
and _the nation’s popular reactions to
that question.

Among the papers which carried
“America Speaks,” were The Pitts-
burgh Press, The New York Herald
Tribune, the Chicago Da.ily News, The

Boston Globe, The Detroit News, The
Cleveland Plain Dealer. The VVashing-
ton Post, and papers in:San Francis-
co, Los Angeles, Atlanta, St. Louis,
and other large cities.

Professor Maulsby resigned his po-
sition here this fall to take over edi-
torial management of the project.
Tib.by is at present doing research,
writing, copy reading, make-up and
general editorial work.

“America Speaks” will be a weekly
feature with a circulation‘ already es-
tablished of more than 5,000,000.

Columbia University School of Law,
which had awarded Tibby a dean’s
scholarship, has granted him a year’s
leave of absence during which time
he will deﬁnitely decide whether he
will accept it.

“America” Speaks” is officially
known as the National Weekly Poll
of Public Opinion, under the sponsor-
ship of the American Institute of Pub-
lic Opinion. 1 -

{Pre-Law Smoker
-Features Speech
U By Judge Smith

Youthful Common Pleas Jurist,
John Marshall’s Guest, Will
Hit Outworn Precedents

, By William Stark

“The Chinese are not the only ones
who practice ancestral worship,” main-
tains Judge Ralph H. Smith, of the
Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny
County. “The law profession also con-
tinues to base present-day decisions.
on precedent handed dow11 150 years
ago.”

Judge Smith will amplify his. state-
ments on the stranglehold of preced-
ence in law practices at a smoker to-
morrow night sponsored by John Mar-
shall Club, honorary pre-legal frater-
nity, at which he is the featured
speaker. .

TAt the age of 33, Judge Smith has
been a member of the Common Pleas
Bench for three years. After grad-
uating from the University of Pitts-
burgh Law School in 1924, and prac-
ticing for a few years, Judge Smith
became a District Attorney. In 1931,
he became a United States District
Attorney, which position he held un-
til his election to the Common Pleas
Biench.

=Judge Smith is quite short, being
hardly ﬁve feet four inches tall, and
weighs about 150 pounds. He is not
very sensitive about his size, stating‘,
“Wl1at we short fellows lack in physi-
cal strength, we make up in use of
the tongue. Some times we wish for
greater physical strength, in order to
save our tongues.”

Judge Smith is quite emphaticabout
the attitude the lawyers of today take
on their “ancestors.” He feels ‘that
precedent in judicial work should be
used only to the extent of surveying
the past and taking the important
parts from experiences, and should
not be allowed t.o be the basis, com-
pletely, of present decisions.

In speaking of his work, Judge
Smith said, “Too many people think
that the work of a judge is merely a
matter of sitting on a bench all day.
Our work just starts after we leave
thg bench at 3:30 _o’clock. Then the
work of writing opinions onvmotions
begins. Besides, we serve from Sep-
tember through June without a let-
up‘):

Judge Smith admitted two ambi-
tions: “I hope that I never reach the
point where I will say, ‘Why, when
I was your age,’ or ‘Oh well, he doesn’t
know better, he hasn’t lived long
enough.’ ”

Judge Smith will address John Mar-
shall Club, at its annual smoker, to-
morrow evening, at 8:15 o’clock, in
the Y !Hut. He will speak on “The
Place of Law in the Modern World
From a Social Point of View.” Frank
Reich. president of John Marshall, will
preside. Reich stated that this smoker
lS‘_fOl‘ the purpose of acquainting all
students with the functions and pur-
poses of John Marshall. All under-
graduates, pre-legal students, both
men and women, are invited to attend.

Dodds Comments On. New
‘Anthology 0fEnglislt Prose

By Milton Lehman

Anthologies have been edited and
printed by the score and it is usually
a difficult undertaking to prepare an
anthology good enough to stand
against the competition of the number
of ﬁne ones already on the market.

Probably the most recent addition
to the ﬁeld of anthological collections
is the two volume set “An Anthology
of English Prose” and its companion
“An Anthology of English Poetry.”
The former is the combined work of
Mr. Arnold Vvhitridge, master of Cal-
houn College at Yale, and John \V.
Dodds, associate professor of Eng-
lish at the University.

The prose volume, of which Mr.
Dodds is a collaborator, has already
been adopted for the course of study
in the English departments at Yale,
Wellesley, Western Reserve, North-
western, and Wisconsin.

Its immediate success is sufficient
proof of its merit. Said Percival
Hunt, head of the English department
at the University: “It is one of the
finest anthologies that has come to
my attention in many years.”

The work has been under prepara-
tion for two years and was released
for sale in June. “Every work of this
nature must have a purpose in being
printed,” said Mr. Dodds. “The editor
would call it an apology,” he smiled.
The purpose of the Oxford volume is
to present a logical chronological sur-
vey of English literature, differing

from previous works by right of the
completeness of its selections.

“Most anthologies have the tendon-
cy to present a smattering of excerpts
from many writers,” l‘€Il‘.2ll'lie(i the
editor. “We liave attempted to select
the key ﬁgures from English literature
and to qualify them with a complete
selection.”

Fifty-nine authors are represented
in the book and almost all of them
are familiar to the student of English.
From the ancient Malory to the con-
temporaries Chesterton and Galswor-
thy, the survey is complete. The se-
lections naturally reﬂect the prefer-
ence of the editors, but there is no
fault to be found with their choice.

Several names are rated worthy of
membership in the volume that have

been rather ignored by previous
anthologists. In the Oxford Anthol-
cgy we shall ﬁnd representative

works of the lesser lights such as Sir
Charles Lyell, George Borrow, Sir
Edmund Gosse, and Laurence Sterne.

Of particular interest to Mr. Dodds
is the letter received from George
Bernard Shaw regarding the editor's
request for permission to use a selec-

tion from his “Preface to St. Joan”
in the antholo:-.:y.
Typically Shavian, the eccentric

rlraznatist bas.e(l his refusal upon the
fact that he did not wish to lose his
following in schools and colleges and
that “selections in anthologies de-
velop a healthy hatred between the
student and the author.”

Seibei Commends
Last Journeyman

Compares Magazine With Others;
Rates Literary Standard High

The next issue of the Journeyman
magazine which Quill Club, honorary
literary fraternity, plans to issue this
December will have, according to
George Seibel, local dramatic critic,
“a high standard of literary excel-
lence,” if it continues in the tradition
established by last spring’s Journey-
man.

“I have not read very many college
publications,” continued Mr, Seibel,
“but the last issue of Journeyman
seemed to me to rate very high among
those I have read. Its quality was
particularly ‘good for a student-writ
ten magazine.”.

This term, as last semester, Quill
Club plans to make the Journeyman
representative of the whole school
and is consequently asking that non-
Quill members should submit as soon
as possible any manuscripts they wish
to have considered for publication. .

Manuscripts may be submitted to
Quill members or to Miss Mary Mil-
burn in the office of the dean of men,
Room 801, Cathedral. Miss Milburn
is also receiving applications for the
remaining position on the Journey-
man’s editorial staff, open to any up-
perclass student who is not a member
of Quill Club. These applications
must be in by tomorrow.

SFA To Consider ‘
Abolishing Class
Periods 5th Hour

Second Assembly Session To Hear
Other Committee Reports;
Harvey Invites Students

The disadvantages and possible
abolition of ﬁfth hour classes will be
discussed at the second meeting of
SFA tomorrow night in Room 801,
Cathedral.

Lois Follansbee, Ed37, will present
a survey of the number of classes
scheduled for and continuing through
the ﬁfth hour, and will suggest plans
for doing away with lunch time classes
entirely.

According to Miss Follansbee’s re-
port, there are 49 different courses and
99 classes which meet either from
12:30 to 1:30 o’clock or from 11:30
to 1 o’clock. In this group are in-
cluded two and three-credit courses
and classes scheduled to meet one,
two and three times a week.

The problem will be put up for open
discussion at the Assembly meeting
in an effort to determine whether most
students object to the time of the
classes or are indifferent to being
forced to give up their 1u11ch hour.

Miss Follansbee has drawn up a list
of resolutions discussing the bad
points of the “forgotten lunch hour.”
She will contend that the ﬁfth hour
class limits the social contacts which
students may make at the University.
an essentially bad feature in an urban
institution. She will assert that the
student’s efﬁciency is decreased by
working through the lunch period.

In the Assembly, the fairness of
such classes to both students and in-
structors will be discussed before the
group decision is reached. After the
SFA vote on the matter the general
student opinion on the problem will
probably be solicited. According to
Vvilliam Harvey, C36, president of the
or;tanization, “The matter will prob-
ably be submitted to the student body
sometime this year. We like to have
student opinion before we decide up-
on. such an important issue.”

A report from the committee on
committees will be submitted by
Charles B. Holstein, C_36_. Holstein will
propose several groups to be ‘soon-
sored by SFA to improve student-
faculty relations. The committee will
attempt to extend the scope of SFA
in student affairs.

Other reports to be heard tomor-
row include those of the executive,
social, appointments, and customs
committees. Harvey announced Fri-
day that the meeting is open to the
student body.

 

Revenue Oﬂicer
Explains Tax Act

Shows, Dances Require Permits,
Club Dues Are Not Taxable

I11 answer to inquiries as to whether
fraternity and club dances, amuse-
ments, or shows are taxable, John C.
Morlock, of the Pennsylvania Depart-
ment of Revenue, in a bulletin to The
Pitt News, deﬁnes the conditions un-
der which such taxes are applicable.

According to the Amusement Tax
Act, dues of fraternities, clubs, or
any similar University organization
for membership_. board. or lodging are
not taxable and no permit is re-'
quired.

But, the statement explains, “Ad-
missions charged for an amusement,
whether a show, dance, or any other
entertainment, as deﬁned by the Act,
are taxable, and a permit is required.
The charge for each permit is one
dollar.”

“If the entire proceeds, however,
after payment of reasonable expenses
received from any such ainnsement
inure exclusively to the benefit of the
University, then such proceeds are
exempt from the tax. In such a case
a permit is required, and an applica-
tion for exemption must be ﬁled with
the Department of Revenite. The ex-
emption will be granted when ﬁled."

The Department will furnish D€‘.‘1'l'l1li.
and exemption .'-=pplications immediate-
ly upon request, 3‘./lr. Morloc‘.-I ado‘s.

“in order to avoid any embarrass-
ment,” said N. Robert. Seidle. assist-
ant to the dean of men, “I strongly
urge all fraternities or clubs involved
in this ruling to follow it exactly.” Mr.
Seidle advised anyone in doubt about
the provisions to consult, him. Ruth
Anderson, Ed36. or Vvilliam McQuade,
E37, of the SFA social committee.

The Greek Situation

FINE EXAMPLE of what we would be prone
A to call understatement comes with the sec-
tion of a page one news story where “fra-
ternities are urged to send a representative to the
office of the dean of men by 5 o’clock today to re-
ceive notice of boys pledging to the fraternity.”
The idea of any of the Greek houses staying away
from this “Night Before Christmas” affair is
rather difficult to conceive.

, Although nothing deﬁnite can be learned, as in
the Ethiopian war dispatches “it is rumored” that
the fraternities are in for a good year. The num-
ber of bids extended exceeded the guesses of both
official prediction professionals, and the number
of acceptances could easily follow that proportion.

During the past week virtually every freshman
was called in to make a. decision regarding frater-
nities. For those who found it wise to pledge,
it is hoped that the ideal situation, whereby each
pledge is able to continue his affiliation with the
house of his ﬁrst choice, will prevail. For those
fellows who found it inexpedient to join a fra-
ternity. it can be safely suggested that “the cam-
pus still loves you.”

Editorial Briefs

Tomorrow night the Student Faculty Associa-

tion will starts its machinery moving. After several
preliminaries, the Association will meet to begin
active legislation. _
’ This year the student governing body is on the
spot. Its newness last year was capable of ac-
counting for a multitude of sins; now the Associa-
tion has to dig in to prove its worth. The person-
nel of the organization appears to be of very able
character. The track is cleared, the hurdles are
up, and the entrants are ready. All we need is a
good, clean race.

Two weeks ago the University Band staged a
workout in the Commons Room. Those who saw
the drill hailed it as good. In addition, that inno-
vation forms a great selling point to spring on the
cousins from Kansas.

“Is this Commons Room of your building pretty
bigi?"

“VVell. rather. One time. when it rained, our
entire 125-piece band worked out in one corner
of it.”

It will be interesting to note what attitude the
freshmen who considered themselves “too dig-
niﬁed” to wear the green and white buttons will
take when they see these good-looking blue and
gold pins.

VVhen a freshman can sing that la la la la la la
la business with the band when M r. Lockhart has
the baton, we could say off hand that he was
oriented at last.

‘Nliat this Universi.+_v needs more than anything
else right now is an Idea Bureau to think up ways
of .0-'et‘rin.<2' ten dollars for that \Vest Point ball.

The International:

By The Reviewer

The usual cry against the Jury of
Awards First Prize for the Interna-
tional Exhibition of Modern Paint-
ings is heard once again as critics,
students, and journalists g_ather to
discuss the Show; and I, too, join the
usual cry. My reasons do not con-
cern technique that is as purely an
artist's problem as are the commas
and capital letters in a newspaper
story the copy reader's problems. My
concern is rather with what the paint-
er tries to tell me. If it is just a
picture pleasant to look at, nice col-
oring that leaves no deﬁnite feeling,
in short, has no expression, no inten-
sity of emotion, then that picture
has no right to be called a prize win-
ner. In that short category falls Hi-
polito Hidalgo de Caviedes’ “Elvira
and Tiberio.”

In the J-ury’s Second Prize selec-
tion, Charles Burchﬁe1d’s “The Shed
in the Swamp” there is a feeling of
desolateness and the macabre touch
of the two ravens against the cold
sky that make an impression on the
viewer. The impression isn't as sharp
as Henry Mattson’s “Deep Water” in
which he claims to have painted the
feeling of the scene rather than the
actual scene and was highly success-
ful in doing so. As one views his pic-
ture there comes a real feeling of
nausea and almost fear, the same
kind that grips you when you jump
into the water on a dark night.

Since two of the prize winners were
dramatic landscapes, I can think of
three others that made a deeper im-
pression than the prize winners,
Georgia O’Keefe’s “Taos, New Mexi-
co. Malcolm Purcell’s “Farm Land,”
and Jan Zrzavy’s "Industrial Land-
scape.” In O’Keefe’s painting, the
jagged torn out chasms and gulleys
of barren soil show a deep feeling.
an intensity of the emotion of the cold
harsh beauty of this country.

0rozco’s Painting impresses

Zrzavy in his dramatic “Industrial
Landscape” strikes at the ugliness
brought to the world by the advance
of industry. In the foreground is 9.
colorful pleasant stretch of land, a
phantasy of beautiful colors, but it
stops and wretched, incongruous piles
of industrial refuse and black tele-
graph poles begin. The contrast
brings out the mood wonderfully well.

Among the city landscapes of par-
ticular note are the American Ernest
Fiene’s “lLincoln Monument, Union
Square,” and Algernon Newton's
“Outskirts of Cheltenham.” In‘ both
the treatment is realistic. In Fiene’s
painting the atmosphere is blue and
oppressive and in Newton's the mean,
uninteresting houses of a part of that
time carry the mood.

The --picture that impressed-me most
was 0rzoco’s painting “Zapata” of the
great peasant leader of the revolu-
ti_on.x ‘Zapata looms up in the door-
way; before him is the scene of
struggling Mexico. It is the real
spirit of the _revolution that__«Orozco

"has painted—not the hare chasing pic-

ture that some want to make of it——
but the revolution with its human
struggles, its sorrows. Zapata, we
are led to feel, knows the situation
and is master of it. The composition
(in the form of a large X) and the
color (sombre reds contrasting with
blues and whites) reinforce the f"31-
ings which the dynamic lines of backs
and arms bring to us.

Again a Russian, Kukryniksy’s “A
General,” is a relentlessly caricaturei‘.
general with a twisted, leering, vici-
ous face. !He waves a broken sword.
Gold braid tumbles over his should-
ers, medals adorn his chest. People
with smug, empty, pasty faces follow
him. One cannot but think of the
White’s “psychological attack” in
“Chapayev.”

The Second Honorable Mention,
Candido Portin_ari’s (Brazil) painting,
“Coffee,” is another one of particular
interest. The best comparison and
contrast can be made between this
and 0rozco’s, which depends on the
power of line in a few ﬁgures. “Cof-
fee” is somewhat cluttered and lacks
unity to some extent. The plantation
has a busy spirit, a spirit of bending
backs. The overseer, a Simon Legree

——gun, spurs, and all—points authori-
tatively. The trees are in the back-
ground and tend to break the unity
of the picture. The workers are
shown to be strong, though the treat-
ment is satiric, they resemble some-
what the satirized people of Breughel,
an old Flemish genre painter.

Peter Blume comes on the scene
again. You may remember him as
last year’s First Prize Winner with
“South of Scranton," a medley of col-
ors and mixed expression. His latest
creation “Light of the World” is as
surrealistic as the ﬁrst. A dark pur-
ple church on the left, a brighter
house on the right, pleasant land-
scape to the rear with the people
turning their backs on all of these to
observe a brilliant light——which prob-
ably represents science. Attached to
the support which holds up the light
there are false architectural cornices.
At ﬁrst sight it appears to be against
the narrow nature of science, but it is
necessary to see B1ume’s paintings
several times before his meanings
sink in. As my very good friend \Her-
rymon Maurer says, “. . he is not
at all direct.’

Praises “Carnival Interlude” ’
A picture which for some reason or
other appealed to me as the probable

choice for ﬁrst prize was Guy Pene
Du Bois’ “Carnival Inter1ude.” It had
simplicity of line, excellent coloring,
and left a mixed impression of relaxed
gaiety, almost strenuous in its inten-
sity. The treatment is sharp and real-
istic. Du Bois has done many scenes
in this spirit, for he catches the gaiety
and movement and color of the affair
along with the vulgarity.

Another very dramatic picture, al-
though of a. very different type, is
Karl Hofer’s “The Landing.” I-Iofer
is a German and a refugee from the
Nazi purges. “The Landing” is a
scene of people disembarking in the
midst of a storm. The frenzied atmos-
phere suggests somewhat the “Torna-
do” of John Stuart Curry which won
Second Prize two years ago. Here,
however, the painting is not so realis-
tic, and the simplicity of the scene
makes the feeling of storm more di-
rect. The people in the boat are
drawn with few lines but so expres-

Review

sively drawn that their fears are un-
derstood.

There is not so much satire in this
Exhibition as in the last. Three out-
standing contributors of last year are
not represented in this ﬁ‘eld, John
Stuart Curry, whose current painting
is a fair landscape, “Rainbow;”
George Biddle, with only a portrait
this fall, and David Silvette, who is
usually quite forceful but who inter-
ests himself in “Noah.” On the other
hand, Rosenberg portrays the antics
of a side-show performers. Yves Alix,
French, satirizes the snobs who are
looking at shop windows, while lordly
gentleman—the ﬂoorwalker undoubt-
edly—walks about. None of these ex-
cept the Russians general, mentioned
earlier, are very cutting.

Salvatore Dali Represented

One could not very well end a re-
view of an art exhibit at which Sal-
vatore Dali is represented without
commenting on him. «He presents two
of his works, “Nostalgic Echo," and
“The Spectre of Vermeer van Delft.”
The “Echo” is dreamy and distant
with queer repetitions of forms, with
unreal striking colors and a hint of
Death. “The Spectre" has two ﬁgures,
one sitting on the wall, the other,
quite shell-like, has a tree growing

from his chest, a thigh bone much’

elongated shoots out parallel to the
ground. It is held up by a lower-leg
bone, the foot is some distance of.
Which of the two is Vermeer, or
whether either ﬁgure is he, is quite
beside the point, since the surrealist
counts only on a hazy emotional effect
from his combination of peculiarities.
The best advice on these pictures is
look at them, if you get a feeling, an
emotion, all right; but if you don't, it
is all right too.

Despite all that may be said, the
Exhibit is good. It introduces many
to the modern art of Mexico and
South American countries, for this
alone it is commendable, but the wide
range of painting——even if some are
inadequately deve1oped——are worth-
while seeing. Although the gentle-
men would object, I want to thank
Mr. Maurer for his aid, without which
the writing-of this coumn would have
been impossible.

Pitt Suffers First
Gridiron Setback
At Toe Of Peters

Notre Dame Captain Makes Good
On Last-Quarter Placement
To Tame Panthers, 9-6

Conscientious and loyal Pitt adher-
ents are today circulating a petition
calling upon Mr. Percival Hunt, head
of the department of English, to dis-
continue offering his three-credit
course in the study of Shakespeare-

A direct descendant of that Worthy’

Englishman was a large thorn in the
claw of the Panther Saturday, climax-

A ing his efforts by being the ﬁrst Irish-

man to cross Pitt's goal line in four
years.

These same adherents are put some-
what at a loss as to what they C811 (10
about a fellow named Peters. Mr.
Peters it was who marched back from
his end position with but two minutes
to go in Saturday's game and booted
a ﬁeld goal to stop the Panthers, 9-6.
When that football ﬂoated over the
cross-bar of the goal posts, Irish eyes
began smiling at Pitt for the first time
since the days of Knute Rockne.

Pitt counted eight ﬁrst downs to the
Irish total of ﬁve and gained 168 yards
from scrimmage against Notre Dame’s
131.

At the outset of the game it looked
as though the inexperienced Panthers
were going to spring another surprise,
Hub- Randour brought the crowd to
its feet for the ﬁrst time by scamper-
ing 62 yards behind perfect interfer-
ence in the ﬁrst quarter. The block-
ers cleared the path in front of Rand-
our with dispatch, but the pesky
Peters came up from behind and nail-
ed Hub on the Notre Dame 18-yard
line.

The Irish stiffened at this point and
Frank Patrick attempted a ﬁeld goal.
It was Patrick’s third attempt of the
season, but the “third time” held no
charm for the burly fullback as his
kick went awry.

Panthers Score First ‘

Frank Souchak, sophomore end,
partially blocked the Irish return kick
and the Pitts were off. to the goal line.
The quarter ended during the drive
and Greene, Shedlosky, and Stapulis
went into the Panther backﬁeld. Shed-
losky’s 11-yard run and his pass to
Souchak were the big noises in the
Pitt advance, which ended when Pat-
.rick scored from the two-yard line.
The fullback’s try for point after
touchdown was blocked by the Ramb-
lers.

Then the inﬂuence of the Mr. Shake-
speare began to exert itself on the
game. The punting done by this fellow
put to shame any punting that his an-
cestor might have achieved on the
waters of the Avon. One boot traveled
exactly 90 yards and put the Panthers
in a bad spot. =Greene’s return kick
hadtoo much reverse English, and the

Irish got _a. swell break when the “ball,

bounded back to the Pitt 21.

The Ramblers saw the chance of a
college lifetime to score on the Panth-
ers and Shakespeare had his stage di-
rections Well enough in hand to slip
over from the four-yard line and draw
the ﬁrst Panther blood since the fall
of 1931.

Randour covered a Notre Dame fum-
ble on the Pitt 43 early in the third
quarter, but the Panthers couldn’t get
anywhere. Shakespeare was still
kicking with good effect and after one
punt the Panthers were again on the
wrong spot. A penalty came inoppor-
tunely and Johnny-on-the-spot Wood
came hustling into the game to kick
out of danger. The kick was good but
the runback was better, and the Irish
were ready to begin operations on the

_ Panther 34.

Shakespeare and Carideo carried the

‘ ball along. to the 16 before the Panth-

er started to snarl again. It was just
“no go” through the Pitt line anymore,
so Captain Peters tossed aside hi_s
headgear, watched Wally Fromhart
set the ball down on the 26-yard line,
and booted the Panthers right out of
the ranks of national championship as-
pirants.—C. R.

Frosh Eleven Prepares
For Game With Kiski

Anxious to get on the winning side
of the ledger, Coach Mike Mi1ligan’s
Little Panthers will start a series of
stiff workouts today to get in shape
for the Kiski game at Saltsburg Fri-
day.

‘Coach Milligan hopes to iron out
some of the‘ defects that occurred in
last week’s game with the Tech plebes.
He allticinates a complete reversal of
form in this week’s engagement.

Schricker Seeks
135-Pound Boxers

Loss Of Giannatti Leaves Gap;

Team Rounding Into Form
Calling all 135-pound upperclass-
men! This is the cry being sounded
by Coach Jack Schricker from the
YM-YWHA gym. Schricker is looking
for a small bundle of dynamite to re-
place the loss of Jimmy Giannatti,
captain of last year’s varsity boxing
squad.

‘The absence of Giannatti is one .

which seriously affects the chances of
the squad because, at present, there
is no one available who is capable
of ﬁlling this vacancy.

The 145-pounders are coming along
in ﬁne shape with George Kennedy,
Ed McAdams, John Stronko, Raymond
Tomarrelli, and Bill Cummings show-
ing great improvement.

Much attention is being paid to foot-
work and inﬁghting in preparation for
the opening bout with Syracuse on
January 18. Coach Schricker is being
assisted by Willie Davies who was
well known in ﬁstic circles as a for-
mer ﬁyweight ﬁghter of renown.

Carlson To Hold
Cage Tournament

Event To Start October 28;
Variety Of Prizes Offered

Dr. H. C. Carlson, genial Panther
varsity basketball coach, steps into
the local sports spotlight for the first
time this season with his announce-
ment of the annual freshman basket-
ball week, starting October 28 in the

Stadium and continuing until No-
vember 1.
Always one of the University’s

most popular freshman sport events
since its inauguration several years
ago, the yearling basketball week this
year promises to pack more surprises
than a burlesque show. All frosh
basketball players, real or imaginary,
novice or expert, are invited to dig
out last year’s suits and come up to
the Stadium next week.

As in previous years, the basketball
week will be devoted to instructions
in a series of pointers on good basket-
ball which will be given by Dr, Carl-
son. The only slight change in the
program this year is that no teams
will be entered, the teams next week
being pick-up clubs. Along with the
basketball the good doctor hopes to
stress social relationship among the
new players.

As a climax to the event, prizes will
be given out on the last day, Novem-
ber 1, to the winners of the many
prize contests held. There will be
prizes for the oddestuniform, the
oddest socks, the ﬁashiest suit, the
best-dressed player, the sloppiest-
dressed freshman, the biggest feet.
the most hairy legs, and a flock of
others.

The only things necessary for the
freshman to bring are a suit, shoes
and a towel. Fill out the application
blank below and hand it in at the
Stadium or Dr. Carlson's oﬁice in the
Falk Clinic.

Snyder Stands
Out In Novice
Weight Events

VVith the completion of the hammer
and discus throws, Coach Carl Ol-
son’s fourth annual University novice
track and ﬁeld meet came to a suc-
cessful ending on Thursday after-
noon.

Standing out in the ﬁnal day’s
events was Ted Snyder, a tall and
lanky boy from Harrisburg, who cap-
tured ﬁrst honors in the 12-pound
hammer throw and a second place in
the discus event.

Snyder had previously annexed ﬁrst
honors in the high jump on the ﬁrst
day of the two-day carnival and the
eight points garnered in the discus
and hammer events gave him a total
of 13 markers for the meet. This per-
formance gave him second place in
high scoring honors, Charley Parsons
beating him out for individual point
making by the narrow margin of two
points. I

In the hammer event. Snyder tossed
the 12-pound weight 105 feet to out-
distance the ﬁeld. Luke Rowe took
second, followed in third standing by
Alex Kodashove.

Joe Balestrieri won the discus throw
with a heave of 110 feet. Snyder and

Rowe captured second and third
places, respectively.

With weather conditions practically
perfect for both days of the meet,
Coach Olson was well pleased with
the performances made by the novices.
This annual autumn event gives the
Panther track coach a chance to get
a line on the track prospects for the
coming indoor and outdoor seasons.

Opening Discussion Topic
Of Journalists’ Group

 

Xylon, women’s honorary journal-
istic fraternity, will assist women’s
organizations on campus in their pub-
licity program by sponsoring a series
of three forums, the ﬁrst of which will
be held within two weeks. These
afternoon meetings will take place at
Heinz House.

In general discussion, the value of
publicity and the technique of its
presentation will be considered. The
particular problems of each organiza-
tion will also receive attention.

The meetings will be progressive in
nature, the ﬁrst meeting to be con-
cerned particularly with the gather-
ing of news.

VVomen’s organizations have been
requested to select members of their
organization to represent them at
these meetings.

Sally Harris, C36, will be general
chairman of all the meetings. At suc-
ceeding meetings, a member of Xylon
and a general representative of all
publicity chairmen will be appointed
to lead the discussion in conjunction
with the chairman.

Xylon is also sponsoring an alumnae
publication, which will be known as
the Xylon Alumnae News Bulletin.
According to Ruth A. Nickel, C37, ed-
itor, the ﬁrst issue will appear on
Wednesday.

of items contributed by active and
alumnae members and will acquaint
alumnae members with the program

to educators in Ethiopia, will address
the Pittsburgh Community Forum this
evening at 8:15 o’clock on “Ethiopia—-

the large crowds attending the ﬁrst
two Forum sessions at Carnegie Lec-
ture hall.

partment at Muskingum College, col-
laborated in the writing of a book
with the same title as that of his
talk. He was appointed to his posi-
tion as adviser for the years 1930 to
1932 by Emperor Haile Selassie.

Annual Tradition
Follows Ancient
Roman Legends

Three years ago, Miss Thyrsa W.
Amos, dean of women. Miss Helen C.
Battrick, executive secretary. of the
YWCA, and members of the YWCA,
felt the need of bringing the fresh-
men together and making them feel

at home on campus.

Adele Ash, C35, and Margaret
Doescher, C35, did research work on
the customs and legends of Rome
and Greece, and decided on a .Roman
legend for adaptation to their use.
Miss Amos developed itafter the
original custom.

The result of this research is the
traditional hearth ceremony to take
place at Heinz House on Wednesday
evening at 7:30 o’clock. Margaret
Lehm, Ed36, and Ruth Lazirovitz, C36,
have been chosen chairmen.

Fiﬁ Hurdles Bans On Canine Flying,
Accompanies Master On Detroit Trip

By Martha Fuller

Fiﬁ, German shepherd dog of blind
student Robert Gay, has added a chap-
ter to aviation history. This “dog
Lindbergh” was theﬁrst animal ever
permitted to travel in a passenger
plane.

Robert Gay, student in the Univer-
sity department of sociology, wanted to
visit Arthur Dunham, dean of social
work at the University of Michigan.
However, being a conscientious stu-
dent, Gay did not want to miss too
many classes. .An air trip would be
the thing.

When Gay tried to buy a ticket at
the County Airport, he found that a
long—standing rule of passenger air-
lines prohibits the carrying of dogs
and other animals.

“You can make the trip to Detroit,
but you can’t take along any dog,”
said the traffic manager.

“Then I won’t go,” Gay answered.
“My dog and I are inseparable.
Where I go, she goes.”

W. J. Austin, former World War

ﬂier and vice president of the air-
line system, solved the difficulty by
announcing, “This is an unusual case.
But we will let Fiﬁ ride because she
is not really a dog—she is the eyes
of a human being.”

‘Fiﬁ is 21 “Seeing Eye” dog. Born
three years ago in Switzerland, she
was educated at the Seeing Eye
Guide School at Morristown, New
Jersey. In August, 1934, Gay spent
a month with Fiﬁ at the Seeing Eye
School getting acquainted with the
dog and learning to use her. Since
then Fiﬁ has been Gay's ﬁfth sense.

“Fiﬁ liked the trip,” Gay reported
on his arrival in Pittsburgh. “After
a short stop in Cleveland, she was
the ﬁrst to make a -break for the
plane.”

Not only did Austin give his per-
mission to let Fiﬁ ride with Gay in
a. plane, but at a luncheon of the
Pitt.sburgh Aero Club last Thursday
at-the Vvilliam Penn Hotel, he pre-
sented Gay with an accurate model
of a Boeing airliner.
