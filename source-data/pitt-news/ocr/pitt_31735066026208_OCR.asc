For The Pitt News

Amir Flesher says he
wants to do something about
 housing situation at Pitt
and not only complain like
most students do.

Flesher, a Pitt junior
mqoring in English writing,
‘A is a founding member of the
Pittsburgh Student Housing
Cooperative Movement, an
organization whose goal is to
provide a viable alternative to
the housing options currently
available to Pitt students.

As Flesher put it, stu-
dents have essentially two
housing options: live in a
poorly maintained, crowded
dormitory, or in a poorly
maintained, off-campus
apartment. Flesher said nei-
ther of these options ade-
quately meet the needs of stu-
dents.

Students who live in the
dorms generally cannot chose
who their ﬂoorrnates will be.
A handful of students can ruin
the living environment for an
entire ﬂoor by playing their
stereos loudly or committing
vandalism When vandalism
culprits are not caught, the
whole ﬂoor is forced to pay
damages. Dormitory resi-
dents are also required to pur-
chase a meal plan, regardless
of whether the food meets
their standards of quality.

Although students will
ﬁnd no shortage of available
housing off campus, the qual-
ity is often questionable,
according to Robert Hopkins,
Pitt’s director of off campus

. housing.

The Pittsburgh Student
Housing Cooperative
Movement was founded to
fulﬁll the housing and dining
needs that are not met by cur-
rent housing options, Flesher
explained.

Flesher deﬁnes a co—op
(short for cooperative) as a
nonproﬁt business owned and

Co-op housing
solution offered

operated by the people who
use it and whose purpose is to
serve those people.

Speciﬁcally, the aim of
the student co-op movement
is to create a student—owned
living environment managed
and maintained by co-op
members.

He said this will foster a
sense of community and
mutual responsibility among
co-op members, while pro-
viding an atfordable housing
alternative to them.

“In a pragmatic sense,
quality housing is something
we would support,” said
Hopkins, when approached
with the idea of student co-
ops.

The movement is aimed
primarily at Pitt and CMU
students, although others are
welcome to apply, Flesher
said.

“I know there is a
demand for various kinds of
housing that we can’t sup-
ply,” said Norma Shaw, com-
munity housing coordinator
at Carnegie Mellon Housing
Services. Shaw said that
although there is no shortage
of off-campus housing at
CMU, there would be great
interest at her university in a
student co—op program.

The movement currently
consists of a core group of
seven members, and a contact
list of 25 people who have
expressed an interest in the
Pmgmm

The group plans to rent a
building next fall in which six
to 15 students will live. These
students would share equally
in housing and dining
expenses, Flesher said. He
added that each member
would be expected to work
about ﬁve hours per week at
various duties including
cooking, maintenance and
housekeeping. The group can
use the experience to iron out
logistical kinks, and to edu-

Students value time
at festival with
retarded children

Staff Wrlter

When Kristie Horrell woke
up yesterday morning, she
couldn’t believe it was over —
two years of planning, organiz-
ing and helping mentally retard-
ed children was gone.

Horrell, who has spent two
years as the Hand-In-Hand
Festival’s head coordinator,
completed her tenure Saturday at
the 20th of the annual Pitt-spon-
sored carnival for mentally
retarded children.

“I said to my roommate,
‘What do I do now?”’ she said.

Karen Shilling, a senior his-
tory and pre-elementary educa-
tion major, was one of the many
students recruited by Horrell and
other organizers to spend time
with the children.

Shilling worked at the Hand-

In—Hand Festival for two years
as a one-on-one volunteer. “One-
on—ones” spent the day with one
child, helping a child play games
and make crafts at the festival’s
student-sponsored booths.

This year Shilling volun-
teered as a facilitator —- some-
one who monitors the volunteers
to see if they need help with the
children — but she also filled in
as a one-on-one on Saturday.

“I got to see the behind the
scenes as a facilitator, but I got to
work with a child, too,” she said.

“It’s a day when they can get
away and have fun and do things
that other kids do,” said Shilling.

As children and volunteers
visited various craft and game
booths at the festival in Forbes
Quad, music by Pitt and
Duquesne bands permeated the
background. Some children sang
along or danced to the music.

Kelly Schmitt, a sophomore
psychology major who volun-

time this year, said she can’t wait
to do it again.

“It was a really feel-good
atmosphere,” she said. “For one
day these kids are happy.
Everyone is really happy.”

Schmitt found herself giving
and receiving many big hugs and
said a few children followed her
around in search of hugs, smiles
and balloons.

Horrell said Pitt student vol-
unteers do more than just assist
disabled children — they help
parents, too.

night after his co-speaker Gore Vidal failed to show because he was ill.

Gore Vidal too sick for speech

James Maude

 
  

Staff Writer

British journalist and writer
Christopher Hitchens — the man who
called Mother Teresa the “Ghoul of
Calcutta” -— spoke alone Saturday
night after scheduled co-speaker Gore
Vidal failed to show due to illness.

V1dal’s absence forced Hitchens to
switch gears in the event publicized as
“Gore Vidal in Conversation with
Christopher Hitchens.” He decided to
host a conversation with the audience
instead and field their questions.

Hitchens, who is on a national tour
with Vidal and was brought to Pitt by
Pitt’s Cultural Studies Program and
English department, began by speaking
about his absent co-speaker. He listed
V1dal’s many achievements in literary
and political circles, and praised his
new novel, “The Smithsonian
Institute.”

“Gore Vidal is America’s only true
literary biographer,” said Hitchens to a
packed Soldiers and Sailors Ballroom
audience.

Hitchens discussed numerous top-
ics throughout the evening including
NATO, the situation in Northern
Ireland, the current presidential scan-
dal, Mother Teresa, capital punishment
and Princess Diana.

Hitchens, who wrote a critical book
about Mother Teresa likening her
administrative actions to those of a
tyrant and referring to her as the “Ghoul
of Calcutta,” said, “I’m just wondering
at what point in the leathery old hide to
make the incision,” when an audience
member introduced Mother Teresa as a
topic of discussion.

He also condemned her Nobel Prize
acceptance speech in which she said
abortion and contraception were two of
society’s biggest evils.

To accompany his religious criti-
cisms, Hitchens commented on several
political issues, including the death

penalty.

“I don’t believe that the state 

should have the power of life and death.

v“

3..

I don’t trust them with it. It’s been kept 

strictly as a tool of social control, an
unscrupulous tool of death used by sec-
ond-rate politicians.”

On the International Court of
Justice in the Hague, the Netherlands,
where Serbian war criminals are being
tried, Hitchens said that the court would
be taken more seriously if it did not
prosecute people from the losing side of
a conﬂict.

“Nuremberg rules belong in Chile
and East Timor, just as they belong in
Bosnia,” said Hitchens, claiming that
war criminals in allied countries should
be prosecuted just as if their country
was not a U.S. ally.

As an example of which Western
politicians should be prosecuted,
Hitchens jokingly suggested former
U.S. Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger.

Hitchens also discussed the United
States’ sense of irony, or lack thereof,
saying that a ‘‘10-point ironic font”
should be used for ironic statements
made in the press so as not to offend
any reader.

He bashed censorship in the media
and the excuses used to try justifying it.

“They say censorship is used to ~
protect the children,” said Hitchens.
“Why don’t the children ﬁnd out about
these things the same way as we did?”

Hitchens spoke of his distaste for

the division of Ireland in 1922 and for v

the suffering that partition has imposed
on the population since then.
“Partition has two salient features.

Vldal, page 3

Monday, 23 March 1998

FROM PAGE 2

One, it leads to another war, and two, it
leads to another partition.”

He also cited Cyprus, and Kashmir
— over which there is still contention
between India and Pakistan —- as two
examples of the British colonial policy
of dividing their former colonies.

And as could be expected during a
current events discussion, President
Clinton’s sex scandal surfaced.

Hitchens said that had ex-White
House volunteer Kathleen Willey been
the first woman allegedly approached
by the president in a sexual matmer,
then it may have been more damaging.
But because she was the the fourth, she
won’t have impact because the previous
three hardened up the American public
opinion.

Hitchens said that most of these
women would not have even been near
the president were it not for the donor

THE PITT NEWS

system prevalent in Washington, D.C.,
political circles, pointing to the fact that
Lewinsky’s internship at the White
House was arranged through inﬂuential
friends.

“If Monica Lewinsky’s father had
more money, she could’ve purchased a
night in the Lincoln Bedroom,” said
Hitchens.

“All [Clinton] is is a front for the
Federal Reserve, corporate, Wall Street-
dominated America. It’s purely fantas-
tic to speak of it as a left—wing/right-
wing issue,” Hitchens said of the scan-
dal’s impact on the presidency.

Hitchens’ last topic was Princess
Diana. He said that her work to ban
landmines detracted from the organiza-
tions and people who were deeply
involved in this cause. V

Hitchens asked, “What do Diana
and a mineﬁeld have in common? Both
are easy to lay, but extremely difficult
and expensive to get rid of.”

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — They were
carjacked in Kansas City, but they

‘stayed calm and unharmed.

They’re 9-year-old Robert
Boston and his 7-year-old sister,
Brittany.

They went rollerskating Friday
night with their mother and her
boyfriend. On their way home early
yesterday, the boyfriend stopped for
a bite to eat.

With that, a drunken man jumped
in and drove off, and the mother fell
out an open door.

 

Brittany was asleep and Robert
pretended to be. He fell asleep, too,
after the thief stopped and passed
out.

Several hours later, the man dis-
covered the children. He tried to let
them call home, but that didn’t work,-
so he began walking them home.

Before long, police found them.

The man is now in jail and the
kids’ mother says “everything’s
fine.”

WASHINGTON — Kathleen Willey 
says she’s no “wacko,” as she says ‘

the White House would have people
believe.

In an interview with Newsweek
magazine, she defends the letters she

sent to President Clinton after he ~

allegedly made an unwanted pass at y

her.

Willey says the White House has ?

tried to undermine her character by
releasing the letters. She says she
simply was attempting to get a job,
and there was nothing improper
about the letters.

Willey says she made the deci-
sion to put the incident behind her,

i and that those letters were her way

of saying she still needed a job.

In an appearance on “60
Minutes” last Sunday, Willey said
Clinton kissed her, placed his hands
on her breasts and put her hands on
his genitals during a .1993 meeting.
Clinton denied it.

say, “Without this, I would never have
a day to myself,”’ Horrell said. “It’s a
day when they don’t have to worry
about their child. They know they’re
safe.”

Raylean Garvey, a sophomore dual
business and Spanish major, coordinat-
ed the one-on-one volunteers this year.
She helped recruit and organize enough
one-on-ones to care for the 250 chil-
dren attending the festival.

“It’s deﬁnitely a rewarding experi-
ence for one-on-ones in that they know
they help someone by being there and
paying attention to them, and it makes
you appreciate what you have,” Garvey
said.

Freshman Chris Griswold echoed
that sentiment. He spent most of the

cate potential members by showing them a
ﬁmctioning co-op.

“We want to reach out to people who ‘

might not naturally be interested in cooper-
ative living,” Flesher said He said he would
like to see the development of a diverse
community where people of diﬁerent racial,
ethnic, and economic backgrounds can
interact and live cooperatively.

This might sound like idealism, but
according to Flesher, there is a difference.

“I like to call it pragmatic activism,
where idealism and pragmatism meet each
other,” he said. Flesher contrasts the co-op
movement with campus socialist groups
who focus on large issues that have no
direct impact on the lives of the average stu-
dent. He added that people ' could better
direct their energies toward larger issues if
they took action on a local level. _

Flesher said he was inspired to bring
student co-ops to Pittsburgh after seeing
some of the successful ones that ﬂourish at
other universities. Student co-ops in
Berkeley, California, (University of
California-Berkeley) and Ann Arbor,
Michigan, (University of Michigan) both
house hundreds of students. Smaller co-ops
can even be found at Indiana University of
Pennsylvania and the University of
Pennsylvania. ’

One issue the group has yet to consid-
er is zoning. Under current regulations, no
group of more than three unrelated people
may live together in the same residence.
While fraternities fall under a separate use
category, there are no such provisions for
co-ops. Pittsburgh Zoning Administrator
Jim Brown said that the intent of the zoning
code is to keep school housing on campus-
es. While students could lobby City Council

. to change the current zoning laws, Brown

day chasing 14-year-old Paul Sanker
throughout Forbes Quad.

Paul, who suffers from Down’s
Syndrome, deﬁed barriers and ran up
the escalator while pulling streamers
down before he escaped by elevator to
ﬁnd his “honey,” a female facilitator he
latched onto earlier in the day.

“He was putting the moves on all
the women,” Griswold said, laughing.

Griswold said Paul met other kids
at Hand-In-Hand festivals during pre-
vious years and the boy spent the day
giving high-ﬁves to those he ran into
again. Paul even did a little volunteer-
ing of his own by helping at one of his
favorite booths, the gopher game.

Griswold said, “I have Attention-
Deficit Disorder, and I wanted to help
others who needed more help than me.
I had a lot of fun with him [Paul], even

though he caused a lot of trouble. I was
so tired by the end of the day, and he
was still so hyper!”

Schrnitt said Pitt students’ response
to the kids and the event impressed her.

“I thought there would be a lot of
[students] who would get intimidated.
[But] I didn’t witness one student who
looked like they couldn’t handle it,”
she said.

Garvey and Schrnitt both said the
festival opens students’ eyes to what
they have and how much they can help
others.

Horrell began planning this year’s
event the day after the 1997 festival
ended so that she could correct some
problems with the program while they
remained fresh in her mind.

While studying abroad in Mexico
during the summer, Horrell continued

5

the plarming, keeping in contact with
the other coordinators by mail.

When she returned to Pittsburgh
for this school year, she and the other
coordinators immediately began
recruiting volunteers at the activities
fair. They then set up committees to
coordinate medical assistance, student
volunteers, food and activities for the
day.

From there, committees asked stu-
dent volunteers and Pittsburgh-area
institutions to invite children to the
event.

After two years of coordinating the
festival, Horrell said it saddened her to
leave the event behind, but was grateful
for being a part of helping others.

She said, “You just can’t put into
words what a rewarding experience this
1s.”

Communes: a

really bad idea  

AmirFlesherhasaplantostartwhathecalls."co--

op" housing. Students who wish to participate in this
plan would join with 14 other students, rent: a building
and take responsibilityifor maintenance and upkeep of
the facilities — in effect becoming their own landlords.

The idea is to lower the cost of housing by cutting
out a landlord. Flesher also claims such "co-op" hous-
ing would allow the students to make sure their facili-
ties are properly maintained, thus avoiding the plague
of slumlords.

While this idea may sound creative and promising
onthesurface,italsoseemstobefatallyﬂawedina
number of ways.

If you've ever had trouble with one roommate not
doing the dishes, taking out the garbage or playing his
stereo too loud at night, you can probably imagine
what problems might ensue. Not only would tenants in
such a complex have 14 roommates (or halhnates), but
they would all consider themselves part "owners" of
the facility. There would be nobody in charge to whom
a tenant could complain if the guy downstairs con-
stantly makes a racket late at night or lets his dog uri-
nate in the foyer.

The main problem with this plan (as with most
communist and socialist ideas that provide shared
ownership of property rights to large groups of people)
isthatnoonehasﬁnalresponsibility—theﬁnal
authority needed to get things done.

There must be someone with whom the buck
stops. Otherwise, there is nobody who can act unilater-
ally to ﬁx a problem 9

Such as a problem like plumbing. Most college
students are not expert plumbers, but if a pipe breaks,
they will need to have it ﬁxed

Most students also cannot alford the $200+ fee
that can come with a plumber's house call. A landlord
must be able to handle such problems, and gladly will,
since he has a vested interest in getting the plumbing
ﬁxed quickly. If a busted pipe causes other damage to
an apartment, he will either have to repair it or sulfer
the fallout when the time comes to lease the building
again.

Students, on the other hand, may notbe able to ﬁx
the problem as quickly, letting it go until they have the
money available, or perhaps ﬁnding a way to live with-
out the utility of that pipe. And since they wouldn't
have to worry about renting the place next year, why
bother maintaining the place at all?

Thus the burden gets passed on to the next renter.
Or, if some poor tenant decides he wants the problem
ﬁxed, maybe he can foot the bill himself.

Teacher: WRONG!!

Unless you've been following
the president's actions diligently for
the past few weeks, you just may
have a question. Yes, Clinton took his
hands oﬁ intimidated females just
long enough to accomplish some-
thing: He signed an executive order
into law ordaining Lake Champlain

‘as a "Great Lake." Never mind that

Champlain happens to be less than
one-quarter the size of the smallest
original Great Lake. Shazam! Now,
it's great.

Many of you probably didn't
know that the president can arbitrari-
ly make laws. Ha! Fool, you proba-
bly took the Constitution literally
when it reserved legislative power to
Congress. To make an executive
order, all the president has to do is
write the law and publish it in the
Federal Registry (an automatic
process). Congress has been super-
seded and has no
recourse.

If all the president did with this
unbridled power was rename a few
ponds, change designations and gen-
erally revamp geography books, no
one would be alarmed.

But allow me to remind you of
Executive Order (EO) 9066 that
Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed
into law in December 1941. VV1th this
order, FDR forced over 100,000
Japanese —— all legal aliens or U.S.
citizens — to be placed in concentra-

immediate

tion camps.

If that doesn't curl your skin,
consider EO 12919 signed into law
by President Clinton in 1994, which,
among other things, gathers into a
single executive order a dozen previ-
ous orders, reaffirming their legality.

The following executive orders
have been written into law for years
under various presidents including
Johnson, Nixon, and Carter: EO
10990 allows for the government to
take over all modes of transportation;
E0 10995 allows government
seizure of all communications media;
E0 11000 allows the government to
mobilize citizens into "work
brigades"; EO 11003 allows the gov-
eminent to take over all airports and
aircraft, including those that are com-
mercial; and E0 11004 allows the
government to relocate communities,
build new housing with public funds,
designate areas to be abandoned and
establish new locations for the popu-
lation.

All these stand as executive
orders to establish and legalize future
executive orders and solidify dictato-
rial traits in the presidency.

Think about it. President
Clinton, right now, yields the power
to force you, your family, and your
neighborhood to abandon your
homes, join a work brigade, and live
in a new designated area. As out-
landish a prospect as this may seem,
not only has it already happened, but
the organization to implement such
an action is currently in place.

The Federal Emergency
Management Agency . has been
assigned the responsibility in the
event of such a crisis. While FEMA
may be popularly known for disaster
aid, it spends only six percent of its
budget on national emergencies.
Where is the other 94 percent? Either

or a vote by Congress? No, by EO

You may wonder, on what basis
is the president able to unilaterally
enact law? Abraham Lincoln sus-
pended the Constitution during a
state of war. The courts and Congress
intentionally do not distinguish
between a state of war and a "state of
national emergency". According to
one Senate report, "Since March 9,
1933, the United States has been in a
state of declared national emergency.
 This vast range of powers, taken
together, confers enough authority to
rule without reference to normal con-
stitutional processes." Furthennore,
in a state of emergency, Congress
cannot even review a president's
actions for six months.

I ask, how can anyone feel espe-
cially secure when one single man
possesses the capability to, for all
practical purposes, enslave large
populations? But, what can one do?
It's obvious that no president will
rescind the national emergency
power and voluntarily forfeit power.

However, as citizens, we must

_remain aware of such potential abus-

es and prevent more constitutional
bypasses in an attempt to usurp our

freedom. Gun control, excessive,

environmental regulations, school
choice, and taxes remain issues that
we must take a stand on and about
which not allow any more abdica-
tions of our freedom.

Columnist

Obsession is a strange creature.
Rational men and women are often
brought down by their desire to be with
someone who is, for the moment, total-
ly out of their reach. This obsession
eats them alive, and distracts them
from day-to-day living, tangible rela-
tionships, and work or study time.

My obsession, for the moment —
these obsessions are short-lived, for an
obsession for one person is easily
replaced by an obsession with another
—— is an actress whom not many people
have heard of: Bridgette Wilson.

I predict that Bridgette Wilson will
be known in later years as the "Julie
Newmar of the '90s." She has kicked
butt in Mortal Kombat, been on the
wrong end of an ice hook in I Know
What You Did Last Summer, stroked
Richard Nixon's thigh in Nixon, and
starred as a fourth-grade teacher along-
side Adam Sandler in Billy Madison."

But I don't believe she will achieve

the heights of fame that Kate Winslet, A

Sarah Michelle Gellar or N eve
Campbell have reached. In a way, that's
a tum-on unto itself .——- the fact thatshe

is a B-movie actress, and not mined by 

Forays into the dar

being overexposed in photoshoots or
interviewed by paparazzi. She has not
sold out by being some moll in some
silly action movie ﬂop starring William
Baldwin and Dennis Quaid that
nobody will see anyway.

Just as Pitt News Managing Editor
Zachariah Blott has erected a shrine in
honor of Pitt basketball player Attila
Cosby (Blott lights a candle after every
Pitt win -— needless to say the ﬁre
alarm on the fourth ﬂoor of the
William Pitt Union did not go off very
often this past season), I intend to do so
for Miss Wilson.

Many people disagree with me on
the subject of Miss Wilson; some guys
say she is rather masculine in appear-

’ance, and not that attractive, but there

must be some quality that grips me.
Obsession has a funny habit of making
one fall for things or people one would
not ordinarily fall for.

But on the subject of looks, she has
shapely legs, long blonde hair, blue
eyes and other stuff that would cause
an unstable dude such as me to be
obsessed with her.

But whom will Ibe obsessed with
next summer? Will a young hotshot

I knock Attila Cosby's shrine out of The

Pitt.sNews’ office? Orwill  crazy

psycho woman who happens to like

»Yorker and Wisden Cricket Monthly

come along and make my obsession a
distant memory?

Even though these obsessions are
usually short term, they can be a damp-
ener on one's life and can be extremely
difficult to get out of. But is that neces-
sarily a bad thing?

Some people say that obsessions
are unhealthy. However, I beg to differ.
Obsessions help fuel the determination
of a young scalawag who wants to
make it in this world. If one doesn't
drool over piles of money (which is,
technically, an obsession) in this capi-
talist society, then one is not going to
go far. '

Women and money, according to
most psychologists, form the basis of
most male obsessions. They are what
most of us crave, and we will, some-
how or another, get what we want. And
through these obsessions, women have
learned how to play with the male psy-

che, and twist this to get what they «

want. ,

Sure, women have obsessions too
(somehow George Clooney and Val
Kilmer N are able to scrape together a
living), but}. they're not addressed as

 

Monday, 23 March 1998

  

k side of our obsessions

much as are male obsessions, and I
can't speak on behalf of most women,
for fear that I may be bludgeoned to
death with any number of blunt
objects.

But I know that I'm not the only
one. I know of about 12 guys on cam-
pus who have a "thing" for porn star
Jenna Jameson (to emphasize her mag-
nitude in the industry, she is to porn
what Nelson Mandela is to politics).
One even posed as a reporter from The
Pittsburgh Pornographic News (for
those anxious to head to the bookstores
and grab a copy — no such magazine
exists) to secure an interview with
Miss Jameson when she was in
Pittsburgh last month with another
porn star called Alyssa Milano (no, not
the same person as that woman from
"Who's the Boss?").

To err is human, and to be obsessed
with something is okay as well. I just
wish those psychologists would stop
showing me those inkblots on cards,
because they know that all I see is the
fine, shapely form of Bridgette Wilson.

James Maude was once arrested in
Cape Town, South Africa for stalking
Booker Prize-winning author J.M.
Coetzee.

Greek Sing
interferes with
studying

Hundreds of students use Forbes
Quad as a place to study every day.
However, lately this has become

increasingly difficult. It seems that the

quad has been invaded by an army of
singing and dancing Greeks. I'm not
criticizing the frateriiity/sorority mem-
bers at this university, but they are inter-
fering with the study habits of many
students.

I'm sure that this university has
other places for their singing and danc-
ing. What about those houses at the top
of Sutherland Drive? Empty auditori-
urns? There are other public places for
them to congregate and make noise.
How about the ﬁrst ﬂoor of Hillman
Library?

I'm not saying that Greek Sing is a
bad thing, or that fraternities are to
blame for other students’ academic
woes, but they are infringing on others‘
rights to a quiet study environment.

Pitt's red tape
ruins a great
day of sports

I'd like to personally thank Pitt for
ruining what is possibly the most excit-
ing day of the year in sports, the first
day of the NCAA Basketball
Tournament.

Letters ‘should be kept to 250 words
and must include the writer's name.
phone number. and university
affiliation (if any).

 

Last Thursday, around noon, I visit-

ed the TV room in the Virilliam Pitt
Union, as I have for the past two years, "

to watch a few basketball games
between classes. To my dismay, as well
as that of a number of other fans, the
television wasn't tuned to the right
charmel.

I attempted to change the channel to
watch the tournament and was informed

that this was not possible. I ran to the _

information desk in the Union and was
told that the television is "centrally con-
trolled," and that NBC was the sched-
uled charmel for Thursdays.

I asked for the phone number of the
moron who gets to dictate what pro-
grams are watched by students and was
denied this as well.

Not wasting any time, I sprinted to
the Towers lobby, hoping for a broad-
cast of the tournament.

I should have know that when I got
there the TV would be off, and the
process of turning it on would require a
15-day waiting period and the written
signature of the dean himself. At this
point, I had wasted so much time run-
ning around that I was just in time for
my next class.

There's nothing like March

Madness at Pitt! Thanks again!

Penguins teach
hot-tempered
Flyers a lesson

The Penguins’ 4-2 victory over the
Flyers Saturday afternoon was a little
more than just a slap to Philly pride. It
also instigated the kidnapping of Andrew
Jackson’s stem visage from my now-
empty wallet.

But, besides the clog in my cash
ﬂow that this contest caused, it also made
me realize that the Lemieux—less
Penguins are a team in contention for the
Stanley Cup.

The Penguins now lead the Eastern
Conference’s Northeast Division with 86
points, more than 10 points ahead of sec-
ond—place Boston. This year the
Northeast isn’t the crew of cupcakes it
has been for so many years, either. If the
playoffs were to start tomorrow, ﬁve
teams from the Penguins’ division would
make the post season compared to only
three from the much more heralded
Atlantic Division, home of the Flyers.

This Penguin team is 100 times more
disciplined under ﬁrst-year Head Coach
Kevin Constantine than the lethargic
Eddie Johnson squad of last year. Under
Johnson, volunteer practices in the play-
offs were scoﬁed at by most of the team
and the defense couldn’t intimidate Gary
Coleman. There was a lack of concentra-
tion and focus. The Pens went from Mr.
Rogers to Joseph Stalin in coaching
style, and with the change, the team’s
execution went from sloppy to ﬂawless.

The most tangible improvement is in
the Pens’ defense, which has always
lacked, but in the past was made up for
by the incredible scoring offense of
Jaromir J agr, Ron Francis and Lemieux.
With Lemieux retired and his jersey
hanging from the dome of the Civic
Arena, Pittsburgh was forced to focus on
defense and assimilate its style of play to
a neutral-zone trap much like that of the
New Jersey Devils.

The result: The Pens’ opponents’
scoring chances and goals-against num-
bers are down and their olfense is still the
gold of the league.

In Saturday’s game their discipline
won.

The difference was their three
power-play goals in eight attempts, com-
pared to Philadelphia’s lone goal on six
man-advantages.

The blood between these cross-state
foes was already searing before
Saturday’s game due to Darius
Kasparaitis’ concussion-inducing hit on

Mengerink joins Wit

Nick Mengerink captured All-
American honors at this weekend’s NCAA
championships, capping off one of the
greatest freshman seasons in the history of
Pitt wrestling.

But Mengerink’s season almost came
to a painful end just before that goal was
realized

In his match against Mark Smith of
Oklahoma State, Mengerink tore his bicep.

“I’m not even sure how it happened

He lost that match, but realizing he
needed one more win to reach All-
American status, he endured the excruciat-
ing pain and wrestled and beat Iowa State’s
Ben Perkins in his next match.

Only afterwards did he tell anyone
about his injury.

“I didn’t want to set up an excuse if I
lost,” he said

The gutsy perfonnance grabbed the
attention of his coaches.

“He didn’t tell anybody, but he was
hurting,” Head Coach Rande Stottlemyer
said “He’s a competitor, he has that burning

ow and Bodo in trio of Pitt All-Americans

After earning All-American honors,
Mengerink withdrew from the tournament
because further wrestling would have made
the injury worse. Stottlemyer believes
Mengerink would have ﬁnished even high-
er than eighth if he continued injured in the
tournament.

Mengerink’s courageous story over-
shadowed the other highlight of the touma-
ment for Pitt, as team captains John
Withrow and Mark Bodo became just the
sixth and seventh Panther grapplers to cap-
ture All—American honors three times.

1974,, 1975, and 1978]. He’d always

VV1throw went 5-1 at the tourna-
ment, losing only to Ohio State’s
Mitch Clark, who was ranked ﬁrst in
the country and ultimately won the
national championship.

“VV1t Ind a great tournament,”
Stottlemyer said “He ﬁnished third

Rain moves Pitt softball debut to Wednesday

Allcea Crosby
Staff Wrlter

This weekend, the Pitt
women’s softball team would have
played its first games ever.

But, thanks to the cold and
rainy weather conditions, the
team’s four-game schedule at the
Robert Morris Tournament was
wiped out.

The tournament will not be
rescheduled.

The team will make up the four
games lost this weekend by play-
ing Robert Morris College in a
double-header on April 2 and play-
ing another twin bill versus

Cleveland State on a date to be
determined.

According to Head Coach
Michelle Phelan, there is a chance
that the softball team will add
more games to its schedule this
season to accompany the makeup
contests.

“A lot of teams are losing
games because of the weather this
season,” Phelan said. “We want to
play as many games as we can.”

The team had the weekend off
after the disappointing announce-
ment. The players return to prac-
tice today to prepare for
Wednesday’s game against St.
Francis College, if the weather

permits.

The team will regroup and pre-
pare for St. Francis by practicing
in the football stadium to get used
to playing on AstroTurf -— a quick-
er surface than a dirt field, accord-
ing to the coach.

A makeshift diamond will be
set up in the corner of the football
field, with home plate situated at
one corner of the end zone. A tem-
porary fence will be brought in to
circle the outfield, and a soccer
goal will be brought in for a back-
stop.

“The team is really excited to
play on Wednesday,” said Coach
Phelan.

Coach Kirk Bruce moves to the front office  

uc Ies the bench next year.

Patrlck Robertson

Staff Writer

Just last Monday, Pitt
women’s basketball Head
Coach Kirk Bruce said that
nothing could ever get him
to leave the University of
Pittsburgh.

But that did not mean he
would always coach basket-
ball here.

On Tuesday, Pitt
Athletics Director Steve
Pederson approached Bruce
and offered the coach the
position of assistant athlet-
ics director for the Panthers.

Bruce went home
Tuesday night to mull over
this offer and talk about it
with his family. He told
Pederson on Wednesday that
he would accept the job.

Bruce’s new job has him
working with nonrevenue-

producing sports and doing -

some facilities management.
Bruce says- he will be doing
general things to help other
coaches. . ‘ v

The former coach did
say that he would miss
being on the floor coaching
and the competition that the
game brings.

On Wednesday, the

THE PITT NEWS

women’s basketball team
had a meeting that featured
tears and disappointment.

“There will always be a,

soft place in my heart for
this team,” Coach Bruce
said.

The athletics depart-
ment has already initiated
the search for a new coach,

-but no time frame for a final

decision has been set.

“I will use as much time
as it takes to find the right
person, just like I did for the
football and baseball open-
ings,” Pederson said.

The hole at the coaching
position hurts the already
struggling Lady Panthers,
because signing period for
incoming freshmen starts at
the end of the NCAA
Women’s Basketball
Tournament, which is over
in about a week.

Pitt has no head coach
to recruit players, so it does
not expect a spectacular
recruiting class. Assistant
Coach Larry Anderson and
Bruce have traveled to see
some prospective Pitt
recruits, but they cannot
begin actively courting
players until mid-April.

The basketball team had

a 152-193 record under
Bruce coming into this sea-
son but was 14-46 over the
past two seasons.

“We want to get the
women’s basketball team on
the road to success and
aggressively get to work to
get them to the top of the
Big East,” Pederson said.

If the team improves as
he hopes, the Lady Panthers
should be ready for the top
of the Big East about the
time they move into the new
convocation center.

Bruce reiterated that he
never wanted to leave Pitt
and that he saw this as a
good career move at this
stage in his life.

“This is a step a lot of
people my age take. I’m 45
now, and I knew in the back
of my mind that I would not
be coaching much longer,”
Bruce said.

Bruce has "been at Pitt
almost all of his life. He
played basketball here in
the early 1970s and has
coached the women since
1985.

“I’m a Pitt man,” he said
of hisjyears here.

Two scouts attend Pitt’s second NFL tryout

Brett Simon

Staff Wrlter

At Thursday’s second of three
NFL workout sessions held at Pitt,
there was disappointment lingering in
the air like thick Los Angeles smog.

Unfortunately, the Los Angeles
Raiders’ scouts were not present at
the workout. Neither were those of 27
other NFL teams. Only the Carolina
Panthers and New England Patriots
sent scouts to the combine.

Times were slow and improve-
ment was rare. Ironically, the
Panthers’ football practice forced the
workout to be held indoors in the
Cost Center, which is not known for
its fast track times.

Even though some of the players
chose not to participate in all the
events and the times weren’t as good
as at the ﬁrst workout, Carolina scout
Todd Vasvaci liked the talent he wit-
nessed.

“I came out to see what kind of
athletes Pitt has here. I think they
showed they do. Coach [Walt] Harris
is going to continue producing good
athletes as well,” he said.

Vasvaci seemed optimistic that
many of Pitt’s graduating seniors will
be in NFL camps. I

“There will be a lot of players
from this workout in camps, and it’s
up to them from there. I think that
[offensive lineman Tony] Orlandini
and [quarterback Pete] Gonzalez
have a real good shot to be drafted.
Real good,” Vasvaci said.

While Pete Gonzalez didn’t par-
ticipate in many of the events because
of personal bests in the first workout,
there were some bright spots.

Orlandini bench-pressed an
amazing 34 reps at 225 pounds,
which is most likely among the best
in the nation this year.

“I think I did pretty well today,
although I’ve done more reps on my
own than I did today,” Orlandini said
after his performance.

Orlandini isn’t very picky when it
comes to what team he wants to be
drafted by, saying he could “be a fan
of any team” that picks his name in
the late-April selection.

Wide receiver Jake Hoffart too
had a solid day at the workout, setting
a personal best in the vertical leap

with an impressive 38-inch jump.
Hoffart also impressed the scouts
with his shuttle run —— a drill in which
players twice run from one end line to
another to test both speed and cutting
ability.

“I’m pretty sure I had the best
shuttle time with a 4.13 [seconds]. I
was pleased with my quickness today.
I still have to get my 40-yard dash
time down, though,” Hoffart said.

Safety Curtis McGhee has consis-
tently had solid workouts during the
scouting combines.

“My change of direction has been
real good in the quickness drills. I
have to work on my 40-yard dash
time a little bit,” McGhee said.

McGhee wasn’t too worried
about his 40 time all that much
because of his on-the-ﬁeld talents.

“Some people can go out and do
the drills. I can get out on the field
and play football. I had the most tack-
les [on the Panthers] two years in a
row. That’s really going to help. I
want to show them that I’m hard-
nosed,” he said.

“Hopefully I can catch one of the
team’s eyes,” McGhee added.

teams he loves so much. He
says he will still watch the
women play and support the
new coach. He also has
many friends still coaching
here who he will enjoy
spending more time with.

Bruce calls his coaching
experience one of the great-
est of his life.

“I got to coach with my
best friend [Anderson] and a
girl who used to play for me
[Carol Morton], and I loved
all of my teams,” Bruce
said.

Although he will miss
the competition, he knows
he needs to direct his energy

And Simonian has used well his

“Pitt Footbaii is
great fun for everyone!”

plays the game,” Pitt Head Coach Walt
Harris said Thursday after practice. “You
cannot have enough serious guys playing
football. You can tell with Pete that foot-
ball is very, very important to him, and to
be good, to play well and to play hard is
very, very important to him. We’re
tremendously pleased about him.”

The performance of another Division-
I transfer, Nick Goings, has also pleased
Harris so far this spring. Goings, a running
back from Ohio State, will not suit up for
the Panthers next season due to eligibility
restraints, but he has been practicing with
the team throughout the spring in hopes of
earning a starting spot for the 2000 carn-

P31811-

Goings received the opportunity for
practice time when backup running back
Aarnir Dew went down with a knee
injury; right now Goings is sharing the
nmning back slot with Kevan Barlow.

“He [Goings] is probably in shock
right now because he didn’t realize he’d
be carrying the ball every other play,”
Harris said. “I’m sure he thought he’d be
relaxing during spring practice but he’s
getting the opportunity to get better. I think
that with all the practice time he is getting
right now, he’s taking this as a great oppor-
tunity for him to improve his game.”

University of Pennsylvania, is regarded as
a long—term project for the Panthers, but
Harris has already been impressed by the
defensive lineman’s commitment to mak-
ing the football team.

“He’s made a tremendous commit-
ment to be here and he’s done it all on his
own. It was all his idea to come here, his
idea to walk on here, to lose the weight, to
make it with program. We think he’ll give
us a good football player up front, and he
continues to get stronger and more knowl-
edgeable of what Coach [Bob] Junko
wants him to do to be a good football
player for us this season.”

Panther Notes:

- Aamir Dew was lost for the spring when
he suﬁered torn cartilage during a work-
out last week. He underwent surgery for
the tear, and it is not known when he will
return.

- Competition for the quarterback slot is
still up in the air, as Matt Lytle, Tony
Zirmnerman and Matt O’Conner are all
taking snaps during practices.

3 Tight end Kirk McMullen and running
back Creg Bethea, who brieﬂy left the
team earlier in spring conditioning, are
both back with the Panthers but are con-
centrating on conditioning work instead
of onﬁeld drills. .

.Flyer captain Eric Lindros two weeks

ago.

A soothsayer would have predicted
an all-out slugfest, but the match was
silent, save for a ﬁrst period tilt between
Flyer Daniel Lacroix (ﬁve-minute major)
and Penguin Chris Tamer (minor-rnajor
for interference and ﬁghting). Lacroix
won the dull ﬁght with the only connect-
ing punch, knocking Tamer to the ice.
There were only minor skirmishes and
no ﬁghting penalties for the rest of the
game.

Despite only one ﬁght, violence was
still present. In the second period
Kasparaitis knocked Lacroix down, who
then retaliated with a swift stick to
Kasparaitis’ groin in front of referee Don
Koharski. The result was a game miscon-
duct, and the reason was a lack of Flyer
discipline. The Flyers’ boneheadedness
reared its moronic face ‘again a minute
later when Chris Gratton picked up a
two-minute minor for high-sticking on a
meaningless play at center ice, giving the
Pens a 5-on—3 advantage. Frederik
Olausson tied the game a few minutes
later.

The Pens were out shot, but their dis-
ciplined defense gave up few scoring
chances. They were also out penalized by
the reckless Flyers, which is why they
won.

Baseball splits doubleheader at G'iown

Matt Mento

Staff Writer

Alter six straight rainouts,
the Panther baseball squad
began its Big East season yes-
terday, splitting a doubleheader
in Washington, D.C., against
the Georgetown Hoyas. The
Panthers won the ﬁrst game by
a score of 5-1, but the Hoya
bats came alive in the second
contest with a 15-1 rout of the
visitors.

Junior pitcher John Schultz
started the game for Pitt, com-
ing in with an 0-2 record and a
6.55 earned run average.
Schultz pitched strong all game
as he struck out four batters and

Designated hitter Bill
Brown led Pitt with a two-hit,
one-RBI performance at the
plate. Second baseman Harry
Ciavarella‘ had a double and
two RBIs. Shortstop Lou
Melucci also added to the
onslaught withadoubleandan
RBI.

The Panthers combined
for seven hits resulting in ﬁve

 

runs while the Hoyas also had
seven hits with only one run.
The Hoyas stranded nine rim-
ners on base.

Schultz earned his ﬁrst vic-
tory of the season, improving
his record to 1-2, while Hoya
hurler Jason Urban received the

In the second game, it was
the Hoya offense that dominat-

Pitcher Matt Irvin made a
brief appearance in relief of
Coughenour but was replaced
by ﬁrst-game winner Schultz.
In the sixth inning, Kevin
Lazeski entered as relief for a
struggling Schultz, who gave
up four nms on three hits.

Panther shortstop Melucci
again lit up the Georgetown
pitching, notching two hits in
three plate appearances in the
losing effort.

The Panthers managed a
run in the fourth inning cour-
tesy of center ﬁelder Kevin
Foley’s RBI single, which
scored left ﬁelder Chris
Delsignore. But Frwin closed
down the Panthers in the last
three innings. He allowed one
run on ﬁve hits in seven

Pitt 190-pounder Bodo took sixth
place in Cleveland, enough to land him
his third All-American title.

“I don’t think I’ll realize how
much of an accomplishment [being a
three-time All-American] is until
sometime down the ro ” Bodo
explained. “Right now I’m disappoint-
ed about not winning it.”

Bodo had the misfortrme of
wrestling in what is arguably this
year’s toughest weight class.
Stottlemyer said that there were ﬁve
wrestlers, including Bodo, who were
of championship caliber at 190.

‘ Loper handily won his ﬁrst two
matches before dropping a match
against Michigan State’s Pat
McNamer'a. Loper had been leading
for most of the match until he got taken
down with four seconds left. This send
the match into overtime and ultimately
double overtime, where McNamera
edged out the win.

In his next match, it was Loper
who recorded a last-second takedown
to send it into overtime, which again
tinned into double overtime, where
Loper fell short. If Loper scored a win
in either nmtch, he would have quali-
ﬁed to be an All-American.
