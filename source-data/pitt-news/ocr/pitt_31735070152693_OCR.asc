renovation  for
on-campus facilities

Students and staff traveling to the

, Cathedral of Learning’s upperﬂoors C

willsoon be freed from their subjec-
tion to the building’s ﬁckle elevator
system. _

On Tuesday morning, Pitt’s
Property and Facilities Committee

” of the Board ofTrustees approved a

$10 million renovation to the eleva-
tor system, which has not been re-
placed since itwas installed in 1931,
alongwith an additional $48 million
for other projects across campus. 5
. Almost the entirety of the fund-
ing for these projects comes from
the state. A
According to a news release

from the University, the renovation,
which has no start date as of yet,
will feature a “dest1'nation—based”
system. Users will be able to enter
their desired ﬂoor into a computer
interface, which will direct them to
the most convenient elevator:

V Accordingto the committee, this
investment will save both time and
energy. ‘ r C

Tori Lawson, afreshman major-
ing in statistics, occasionally uses
the elevator to visit her professor’s
office on the 26th ﬂoor. She says the
unpredictable nature of the elevator
system in the Cathedral makes this
a difﬁcult task at times. t

Recyclemania fosters friendly competition forgood cause

Lindsay Passo‘delis
Staff Writer

Liza Boulet is a recyclemaniac,but
had no idea what RecycleMania
was two years ago. ‘
Boulet, now a student sustain-
ability coordinator at Pitt’s Ofﬁce
of Sustainability, said she’d been
sitting by Einstein Bros. Bagels as
a sophomore in Posvar Hall when

 

someone “wearing an astronaut-
looking suit” strolled by.

“I had no idea what was going
on, but then I saw them start to go
through the trash,” Boulet, also a
senior majoring in environmental
studies, said. A

During trash audits, an event
within RecyleMa'nia, students
dressed up in hazmat suits delve
into campus trash and determine

‘what percentage of items are re-

cycleable.

RecycleMania is an ongoing
and annual eight-week-long com-
petition between U.S. colleges that
focuses on reducing and recycling
waste produced by consumers.

This year’s competition began‘

on Feb. 2 and will conclude on
March 29.

Bouletisaid Pittlis in its sixth _

year participating in this com-
petition.

At Pitt, RecycleMania volun-
teers —- called recyclemaniacs -

are typically students from orga—.

nizations such as Free the Planet
and Students for Sustainabi_lity,
but others come from a sustain-
ability class in the Department of
Geology and Planetary Science.
According to RecycleMania’s

website, the competition is split
between eight different catego-
ries: grand champiori, per capita,
gorilla, waste minimization, pa-
per, bottles and cans, corrugated
cardboard and food-service or-
ganics.
, Each category has awinner at
the end of the competition.

RECYCLEMANIA     

In the Atlantic Coast Conference, 12 of the
15 schools in the conference participate,
excluding Wake Forest, Virginia Tech and

Georgia Tech. It’s a way to categorize and .

compare the University to other schools in
its conference, according to Boulet.

According to RecycleMania’s website,

after the third week of competition, Pitt is
ranked third in the gorilla category, ﬁfth in
paper and 10th in corrugated cardboard.
In the grand champion category, Pitt is in
34th place overall and ﬁrst place in the ACC.
As of time of publication, Pitt has recycled
10.155 pounds of recyclable material per
capita.

RecycleMania has consolidated efforts
from a number" of people across campus.

Laura Zullo, senior manager of energy
initiatives at Pitt’s Facilities Management
Department, which is responsible for man-
aging waste and recycling on campus, said
the department has led Pitt’s RecycleMania
efforts.

plied by our waste and recycling haulers,”
Zullo said in an email. “They also make and
install the promotional banners and sig-
nage you might see in campus buildings.”

Zullo said Facilities Management col-
lects recycled materials from all education-

al and general facilities as well as residence
halls and most athletic or recreational fa-
cilities.

According to Zullo, Pitt recycled more
than 1,420 tons of materials —— almost 42
percent of the University’s total waste —
in 2013. ,

“We want to make sure that the Pitt com-
munity is aware that we have an aggressive
recycling program and hopefully encourage
faculty, staff and students to think before
they throw things in the trash,” Zullo said.

Madeleine O’Connor, a communications
associate at Keep America Beautiful, which
provides program management at Recy-
cleMania, said that 461 schools consisting

 - of more than 5.3 million students and more

than 1.2 million facultypand staff are par-

ticipating in RecycleMania this year in all _

50 states, Washington, D.C., and Canada.
The University of North Carolina, lo-
cated in Chapel Hill, N.C., is a tough com-
petitor, Boulet said, because the university
is very environmentally focused. P

RECYCLEMANIA

Recycling,..said sustainability haslbeen a
focus on campus for decades. .

j She said the university has held a compe-
tition for 20 years called the Green Games
between residence halls that begins in Au-
gust and concludes at the end of April with
an awards ceremony. -

"Through the competition, students e
points by conducting programming with a

‘ focus on the environment. Preble said the

competition motivates residence hall com-

munities to put on “environmental fairs” in

their halls to earn points. ‘
Several programs students engage in

at UNC are weekly recycling drivesl(where . V

studentsgo ﬂoor-to-ﬂoor and collect recy-
clables from students), plastic bag recycling
drives and an e—waste drive around spring
break. '

“During the e—waste drive, we set up and-.

have students get rid of what they don’t

. want,” Preble said. “We collect e—waste from

students so they can have a one-stop, con-
venient way to recycle that.”

Preble also spoke aboutthe beneﬁts of ‘

bringing RecycleMania to universities as a

tool to benchmark their recycling efforts.

‘_‘RecycleMania is a useful tool just to see
how you’re doing, because when you want

to know how your school stacks up against V

institutions, we feel like we’re doing a good
job, but don’t really have the facts to back
that up,;’ Preble said. ~ _

Other organizations, such as Free th
Planet, a student—r_un group at Pitt, play
large roles in raising awareness around‘
campus for RecycleMania.

According to Sage Lincoln, Business
manager of Free the Planet, the organi-
zation’s goal is, to increase environmental
awareness on campus and engage in local
and national campaigns and public-aware-
ness events.

Free the Planet has been involved in Re-
cycleMania for four years and works with
Facilities Management to communicate the
department’s goals for sustainability with
students. '

“We really want to change people’s recy-

.. cling habits on campus,” Lincoln, a sopho-

more majoring in environmental geology,
ecology and evolution and urban studies,
said.

In Lawson’s experience, certain eleva-
tors only go to certain ﬂoors. She also _
noted that lights indicating which buttons
are pushed often don’t workanjde are reset
once the elevator hits the ground floor.

Lawson said these are minor; butir-_

Expose peer-reviewed academic literature to online community‘ l

Simon Brown
Columnist T

It seems like a week can’t pass

without some much—publicized '

celebrity,Twitter feud occupy-
ing the headlines of supposedly
legitimate news sources. Unfor-
tunately, the mainstream news
media has not yet considered
the potential market for cover-
ing the professional, intellectual
disputes that cross the pages of
scholarly journals.

Then again, the headline “Ri-
val historians exchange words
over Brazilian sugar economy”
doesn’t capture the imagination
quite like Jonah Hill snubbing
Don Lemon in a hotel lobby.

It’s no surprise that the world
of scholarly discourse rarely cap-
tures popular attention. But even
in public debates on the political
and cultural issues with which

March 6, 2014 | The Pitt News | v\/vvvv.pittnevvs.com

  OPINIONS

 

academics professionally engage,
their learned perspectives too

- often go unnoticed. All of these

trends contribute to what a col-
umnist at The New York Times

-recently described as the retreat

of the “public intellectual.”
While tired criticisms of the

relevance of technical scholarly

research need no more response,

_ the suggestion that academics

could more fruitfully inﬂuence
public discourse is well-placed.
The only way to make accessible
the too-often distant discussion
is through new norms for schol-
arly publication.

Currently, the peer-reviewed
journal article serves as the cur-
rency of every scholarly com-
munity, as it has since the late
19th century. These journals
— written, edited and read by
scholars, usually in the same ﬁeld
or subﬁeld — determine the ca-

 

reer trajectories of any aspiring
academic. Their publications

lengthen the curricula vitarum.

under consideration by any ten-
ure committee, and often form
the basis for employment deci-
sions.

What is more, as any junior
scholar knows, these journals ex-
ist in a complex hierarchy corre-
lated to their scholarly “impact”
—'or the degree to which other
scholars cite their publications in

“their own work. The higher up on
the ladder, the more challenging
and prestigious to cite on your CV.

The university presses typi-

~ cally responsible for publish-

ing these journals also publish
scholarly books and compendia

—— the height of academic impact ,

for some disciplines. The presses
do not operate ona proﬁt mo-

- tive, but instead publish impor-

tant intellectual work as an end in

and of itself —— in line with their
afﬁliation.to the mission of the

, university.

Still, the costs of printing and
editing these journals are suffi-
ciently high that, in most cases,
only university libraries can af-
ford to purchase ‘them + deny-
ing accéss to anyone beyond the
gates of the school.

For universities to begin _
‘to open scholarly discourse to

public attention, the books and
journals that advance these de-
bates ought to be open-access, a

proposal advanced by a growing A

number in academia. By publish-
ing this peer-reviewed research
both through traditional print
methods and digitally for the
access of any interested party,
university presses could expand
the exposure of their literature
without compromising the rev-
enues and other beneﬁts gained

in the process. V

A 2011 report from the Ameri-
can Association of University
Professors found that libraries
and presses that provided some
type of open-access content saw
no considerable declinein rev-

'enues from those products and

sometimes increased them.

This digital medium can alter
not only the method of delivery,
but the product, itself. While
articles presenting arguments,
evidence and conclusions will re-
tain their plac_es as thevehicles
advancing their ﬁelds, they also
rely on a level of familiarity with
the literature common only to
academics.

Online collaborative projects,

 however, can present a wealth of

information and the digital tools
for its analysis, while__ granting the

user the autonomy to conduct his or her
own research and-draw conclusions. One
need only look to a site such as Itinera, an
interactive database maintained by Pitt
faculty that is amenable to any researcher
studying art and travel relationships.
Once tenure committees and employ-
ers begin considering this innovative and
accessible work for its scholarly merits,

digital projects will receive both the pub-

lic attention and academic critique they
deserve. ' -

But even the most optimistic would
strain to believe that the highly special-
ized and particular information contained
within these websites will diffuse to public
opinion as soon as they’re made available.
Sure, scholars‘ and students may be in-
clined to consult these sites, but it’s doubt-

_ ful that the man on the street will peruse

his morning issue of the Americanjournal
of Political Science alongside his news-
paper —- especially when he wo ’t even

peruse the newspaper in the ﬁrst place,
statistically speaking.

Scholars, then, should be better incen-
tivized to contribute to popular discourse,
in layman’s terms, as magazine and news-
paper contributors. As it stands, Ph.D.s see
little professional encouragement to distill

. the research in their ﬁeld‘ to a publicly-

consumable form. Those distinguished
scholars who do, usually in the pages of
The New Yorker or The New York Review
of Books, for example, typically enjoy the
tenure and prestige that lets them disre-

gard the potential reproach of their col-
leagues.

If tenure committees and employers
would review these contributions along-
side journal publication and judge them
for their responsibility and accuracy as
they would any article or monograph, they
could allow younger scholars to represent
their ﬁelds to the reading public at large.

If not, I can only hope that my future
academic employers don’t ever stumble
upon this article"! ~

The design and decoration of the Toon-
seum, located on Liberty. Avenue down-
town, is appropriately eccentric for one of
just three cartoon museums in the United
States. “Bam!” and “Pow!” are printed
above the entrance in red and blue bub-
bles. From there, the museum greets cus-
tomers with a gift-shop, that more closely
resembles a comic shop featuring a large
collection of comics, graphic novels and
action ﬁgures. Beyond that is the ﬁrst of two
exhibits that regularly change throughout
the year. - -

This time around, one of those exhibits

is all about what might be America’s great-

est female comic icon: Wonder Woman.
Although National Women’s Month has
just begun, the newest ToonSeum exhibit,
“Wonder Woman: On Page and Off,” has
been on display for more than a month.
It runs until March 30 and features about
50 pieces of cartoon art and comic strips,
representing female characters front and
center. There’s more than just Wonder
Woman, though. In fact, there are female

March 6, 2014 | We Pitt News | vvvvvv.pittnews.com

characters in roles of all kinds, from hero-
ines to housewives. The exhibit represents
women from a woman’s point of view.

For the new “WonderWoman” exhibit,
Joe Wos, the executive director of the.Toon-
Seum, said he’s excited to try something
new.

“We really-wanted to do something dif-
ferent with this exhibit,” Wos, executive di-
rector and founder of the ToonSeum, said.

The artwork is spread across the ﬁrst
room of the exhibit, organized by time from
the Great Depression tolthe Underground
era and second-wave feminism that began
in the 1960s. It shows a distinct evolution
in the world of comics and the barriers that
women broke. Another distinct aspectof
the exhibit is that almost all of the art is
drawn entirely by female artists.

“More than 90 percent of the comics
are drawn by women portraying women,”
Wos said. '

Whether the women are sex symbols
or housewives, this layer of the exhibit de-
notes the struggles women faced through
the years, and it shows the different ways
women have portrayed themselves over
time.

There are only two exceptions to this-

female-drawn, female—only dynamic. The
“We Can Do Iti” poster created by Pitts-

burgh artist]. Howard Miller was included’

because of its iconic portrayal of Rosie the
Riveter. The second exception is apiece by a
5 local artist depicting Andy Warhol that they
_ decided to include because of its relation
to Pittsburgh. A A A
Alexa Dickinson Pontzer, executive
assistant at the Toonseum, said that she
believes the exhibit can be a source of in-
spiration for modern women. V
“I think it’s very important that women
who want to do something can do it,” Pon-
V tzer said. 1
Pittsburgh hasits own history of suc-
cessful female cartoonists. Pittsburgh-area
nativejackie Ormes, the ﬁrst African-Amer-
ican female cartoonist, penned cartoons for

African-American newspapers such as The 1

Chicago Defender and Pittsburgh Courier.
Pittsburgh is also the city in which Miller
created the iconic “We Can Do It!” poster.

In the exhibit, there’s also a presence ;

— however small —— of localfemale comic
artists within the area. Mandi Bridgeman,
the marketing and programming director

of the Toonseum, was involved in ﬁnding
these Pittsburgh artists and bringing their
work into the exhibit.

‘flt was a challenge because there’s a
very select number of local woman artists
in the Pittsburgh area,” Bridgeman said.

Some of these artists include Diana
Zourelias, Lizzee Solomon and Nora

“ Thompson, all ofwhom contributed a piece

to the show.

But while other female characters re-
ceive some attention, Wonder Woman re—_
mains at the center of any discussion about
portrayals of women in comics.

Wonder Woman was created in the early
1940s by psychologist ‘William Moulton
Marston. Marston developed the charac-
ter at the suggestion of his wife, Elizabeth
Marston, at a time when DC Comics was
dominated by male characters such as Bat-
man, Green Lantern' and Superman during

. World War II. Shewas created as an icon to

whom women could relate, though creative

control remained in the hands of men. .
Because ofWonder Woman’s history and

conception, it was hard to ﬁnd artwork of

Expectations for Ellen DeGeneres as the

began. Of course, after Seth MacFarlane’s
jokes about overweight celebrities, domes-
tic violence and racial slurs and a melody
titled “We Saw Your Boobs” during last
year’s show, how could they not be?

But not only did DeGeneres meet

viewers’ anticipations — she stole'_ the

show. DeGeneres /took command of the
job with bits that were both entertaining
and unexpected without running the risk
of offending the audience —-— something

that clearly was not a priority during last

year’s awards.

' DeGeneres is someone that young peo-
ple can look up to, sure, but she is also
someone to whom we can relate: She’s
funny, she’s easy—going and she does well
to keep up with the times.

For starters, it is widely known that
DeGeneres is a woman who is not afraid to
break the ‘mold. She lived up to her status
right away by taking the stage in a custom-
made Saint Laurent tuxedo, rather than

wearing a gown like most other women
in attendance. This is something we in
Generation Y should be used to, since we
hardly abide by our parents’ gender roles.
It was a refreshing sight at the esteemed
award show. DeGeneres had three more
outﬁt changes, all but one — a fairy cos-
tume ‘— being Saint Laurent tuxes.
Another of DeGeneres’ hosting bits, uti-
lizing social media and the art of the “self—
ie,” was certainly relatable for a younger
crowd. DeGeneres often roamed the aisles
and whipped out her phone during host-
ing to update her Twitter account or take
a picture with a star.
According to CBS News, DeGeneres,
who has 27.3 million followers on Twit-
ter, actually crashed the site after asking
viewers to retweet a selﬁe she took with
nominees including Bradley Cooper, Jen-
nifer Lawrence and Lupita Nyong’o, among
others. This picture also broke the record
—— previously held by Michelle" Obama —
for most retweeted tweet. ‘-
While DeGeneres spent the majority of
her time hosting and chatting with stars
in the aisles, viewers got to see just how

THEATER

ﬁn Iliad’ coversTroj'an War in epic one—man performance

Richard Koppenaal
For The Pitt News

In Pittsburgh Public Theater’s latest pro-
duction, the concept of a one—man show is
pushed to its limit. ,

“An Iliad,” which debuts tonight_ at the

Pittsburgh Public Theater and runs through - 9‘

April 6,4tells stories of the Trojan War and
its many heroes.  1 V '
This adaptation, written by.Lisa Pe-

terson and Denis 0’Hare, is based on the

translation of “TheIliad” by Robert Fagles.
Directed by Jesse Berger, the production
stars actor Teagle Bougere, who encom-
passes many different roles in this adapta-
tion of Homer’s epic poem.

“We have a great actor telling the story.

You’re going to be amazed at what he can.

do and the journey he takes you on,” Berger
said.

In the play, Bougere has the difﬁculth

task'of acting as the narrator, Achilles,
Hector, Agamemnon, Helen of Troy and

other icons of the Trojan War all without
changing costume. However, Bougere is
undaunted by this task, and said that he
welcomes the challenge brought on by so
many different roles. ‘

V “The heart of it is to just make whomever
> you are truthful,” Bougere said. “I just need

to talkto you in a sincere way, and if I believe

-I’m:a woman, you will believe I’m a woman.

‘I  that’s all I have to do.”

_, : 1';_Despite its uniqueness as a one—man
show, “An Iliad” is also intriguing for its

similarities to the epic poem on which it

isjbased. -

‘ 7 “‘The Iliad’.grows out of an oral tradi--

tion,” Professor Edwin Floyd, a member
of the University’s Department of Classics,

‘said. “From the beginning, it was written

down. But it was a written presentation of
something that could have been performed
orally.” ‘

that this isjust one of many interpretations

of the epicpoem. However, the storytelling‘

aspect of the play celebrates the antiquity
and ingenuity of “The.Iliad.”

“It’s a beautiﬁil way oftelling the story,” .

Berger said.- “We don’t know how Homer

told his stories, but it’s probably similar. As '

faras we know, I-Iomer was a one—man band

singing the stories of the Trojan War, so this

is a nice contemporary retelling of tha .”
What adds tothe contemporary nature

of the play is its incorporation of current ’

vernacular, as well as modern events. Berger

alluded to one portion of the play when the .
narrator likens a warrior in the Trojan War 7

to one from Iowabeing shipped off to ﬁght
in’Afghanistan. . '
While “An Iliad” is unique for its moder-

nity fused with ‘,‘The Iliad,” Floyd argued ,

that the uniqueness of “The Iliad” will be
watered down because of the play’s use of
Robert Fagle’s interpretation.

.“A lot of it is lost in translation in Fagle’s
interpretation,” Floyd said; “The rhythm
and musicality in Greek is not the same
here.” i ’

A laid—back she really is. She treated the stars

like they were her friends (although, some
of them probably were), reminding viewers
of something that the Academy Awards so
often makes us forget: These celebrities are
real people with real feelings, families and
ambitions. It certainly served as a reminder
to young people everywhere that ourgoals
are attainable if only we work for them.

Perhaps the greatest moment of the
night — and the thing that really made
DeGeneres the best host ever in the eyes
of many young people — was her emer-
gence onstage with the pizza delivery boy
and three large boxes of pizza. Watching
celebrities in designer attire eat fatty pizza
off paper plates (which_Brad Pitt passed
out, by the way) was such a cool moment
that brought the entire aura of Oscars ex-
travagance down_ to Earth.

Best of all, DeGeneres never forgot to be
thankful forthe opportunity to host. She
shared her appreciation in a selﬁe on Twit-
ter with the caption “#Oscars #Blessed.”

While her jokes might not have had the
ring of “We Saw Your Boobs,” it was nice
to see DeGeneres make the,Oscars a bit
more relatableﬁ

Pitt student c

Jasper ‘Wilson
Senior Stcyj” Writer

Pitt’s Dan McCoy wheeled his chair up the ,

hill that is De Soto Street to get to Sutherland

. Hall, weather and foot trafﬁc be datrmed.

. The Pitt shuttles’ routes often didn’t align
with his schedule, so he took the next-“best”
route. '

“He would literally grind it up the hill in
his wheelchair,” hisfather, Mark McCoy, said.

When the situation allowed for it, Dan
McCoy would work his way up the steep slope
building by building, navigating hallways
and using the assistance of elevators until
reaching the top, his dad explained.

Dan’s methodical efficiency when com- .

pleting a task as mundane as returning to
his dorm room in Sutherland mirrors the
approach he has taken to achieve his big-
gest goalin life — reaching the Paralympics.

The 20-year-old, who lived in the upper-
campus dormitory last year, uses_ leg braces
to walk and a wheelchair to get around be-
cause‘ of his spina biﬁda, a birth defect af-

fecting the lower half of his body. McCoy has .

spent more than a decade working toward
competing at the pinnacle of disability sport
in sled hockey.

“It actually helped his training and his
conditioning during his freshman year, be-
ing on campus,” Dan’s father ‘said. “It was a
fantastic workout.” i _ _

McCoy’s completion of his goal is near.

He is part of the United States sled hockey
team competing in this year’s edition of the
Paralympic Games, which begin Friday in
Sochi, Russia, and go until March 16. The
team arrived there Sunday. ‘

A unique competition

The Paralympics are the equivalent to
the Olympics for people who have physical
disabilities, similar to the Special Olympics
for those with. mental impairments. There
are winter and summer versions that take
place at the same venues as their namesake
a couple weeks after the Olympics conclude.

All sled hockey athletes will play games
in Shayba Arena, where the women’s hockey
games were played a few weeks ago.

' This year is the ﬁrst time selected events

will be ‘shown live or on tape delay in their
entirety on American television, with NBC

holding the broadcast rights for the games - "
_ as itdid for the Olympics.

There are ﬁve winter Paralympic sports:
wheelchair curling, biathlon, alpine skiing,
cross-country  and sled hockey.

How some of McCoy’s teammates qualify

- fortheirsports differs.Anumberare ampu- “

tee former military members who suffered
injuries while serving, others become ampu-
tees after motor vehicle accidents and some

others experienced birth defects, like McCoy. -

But all have lost most, if not all, use of the

' lower half of their body.

Sled hockey differs from stand-up hockey
in a few ways beyond what the name sug-
gests. It is played by people sitting in dual-
bladed contraptions‘ using smaller hand-
held_ sticks in either hand that have metal
points attached for traction and creating
momentum. ‘ i ‘

Current U.S. head coachjeffsauer guided
the University of Wisconsin to two Division
I men’s ice hockey national championships

during his 20 years in charge at the univer-
sity, and he hasn’t changed his approach
while coaching in the Paralympics. ‘

"‘I have done nothing different with this

team thatvl wouldn’t do with a college team‘

or a pro team: same type of drills, same ac-
tivities on and off the ice,”_ Sauer said. “I pull
the string on ’em when rm mad at ’em and
get at ’em to work harder.” -

But there’s one noticeable off-ice expe- "
' rience that isn’t shared — making it onto

the ice-

Sauer said that it is noteasy for the play-
ers to get from the locker room to the ice, but
he added, “Once they get on the ice, it’s like
anew world to them.” '

V ' “Some of them have to crawl, some of
them have to go in their wheelchairs. It’sjust

a struggle to get to the ice surface,” he said.

-“But once they get there, they fly.”

Speed and physicality are aspects of
the game thatstick out to Sauer, especially
given the hard material of thesled and the
close proximity of the players to the ice and
boards.

Rinks used for sled hockey have inclines

ontinues quest at: 2014 Paralympics

' that allow for smooth transitions from bench

to ice and vice versa.

One of the few differences in gameplay
between these two ‘forms of the sport is that
players in sleds cannot skate backwards. This
inability dictates how defense is taught; all
of the instruction focuses on angling and
forcing people to the outside.

And yes, ﬁghting happens.

’ McCoy’s challenge
Back to‘ those treks up the hill last year:
In inclement weather, McCoy often found

' himself having to get out of the chair and

push it up the steep incline, providing what
his father described as rich comedic material
for stories McCoy told his family.

That said, his resolve in achieving his
main objective is anything but laughable.

e McCoy hasn’t spent much time in Oak-
land lately. He’s taking this semester off and
lived at home last term in nearby Cheswick,
Pa., whiletakinga reduced courseload —
necessary decisions in order to train ﬁill-
time and travel to all ‘of the team camps
and warm-up competitions against other

‘ countries. ‘

His degree in rehabilitation science and
sports medicine can wait.

“[Playing on the US. team has] been my
goal since I was 8 years 01 ,” McCoy said.
“School willalways be there.”

His parents agree.

“It’s a once-in-a—lifeu‘me opportunity,” .

Mark said. “[We’re] 100 perceht committed
to helping him do whatever he needs to do
to achieve that dream.”

' Since last summer, McCoy and the rest
of the players on the national team, who
range in age from 15 to 35, have traveled to
Toronto, St. Louis, Madison, Wis. and Wil-
liamsville, N.Y., once, as well as Charlotte,

. N.C., a couple of times.

Camps happened monthly, running from
Thursday to Sunday during the fall. And
thenstarting in mid-January, McCoy and 11
teammates took up residency at the Olympic
Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
for three weeks of intensive on— and oﬁ'—ice

training. The entire team convened there
for a couple of days for practice before ﬂying
over to Europe on Friday.

As a member of the team since 2010, the
forward’s exercise routine has increased in
intensity, too, since he made the provisional
squad-of 18 for Sochi lastjuly.

After beating out 43 other hopefuls in
a two—day tryout to make the team’s initial
roster, a typical week of training for McCoy
consisted of two to three days in the gym with
a professional trainer doing ‘a combination

 

‘ of weight training and cardio- focusedjon
only his upper body that involved rowing '

machines, ski ergs and weights. ‘
V _ He spent the same amount of time on the
ice working on agility, speed, puck‘ handling
and shots. 1
Despite having made the initial roster,
McCoy hadn’t yet ﬁnished What he set out to
accomplish. With one last cut to the squad
plarmed for December to cap the ﬁnal travel

-‘_ roster at 17, nothingwas  So the regimen

continued. , _

Sincejanuary, the workouts have gotten
more frequent, with visits to the gym almost
every day and time on the ice alsoincreasing
to three to four times a week.

McCoy plays locally with the Mighty Pen.-
guins sled hockey senior team, a group he
captains and practices with twice a week.

The mentor . -

Fellow Mighty Penguin Josh Wirt grew
up in western Pennsylvania and won a sled
hockey gold medal as a center with the}U.S.
Paralympic team in 2002 in Salt Lake 

“It was after [Wirt] showed the players
on the local team his gold medal in 2002

‘ — I was 8 years _old + thatl set my goal

on someday playing for Team USA,” McCoy

said in an email.
The two have known each other since

‘ 1998, when both attended a sled hockey

clinic put on by Shriners Hospitals for Chil-

. dren in Erie, Pa., and later shared the ice and

interacted during Mighty Penguins practices.

But their relationship took. on another
dynamic in‘2009 after McCoy’s mom, Angie,
asked Wirt to serve as her son’s mentor, and
they began playing together _on the Mighty
Pens. Wirt had been on a break from the
sport since deciding to attend Pitt—Johnstown
in 2003.

“I had taken so much  off,‘I had lapsed. "

a lot and lost a good bit ofmy abilities,” Wirt
said. “I think we were probably pretty even
at the time. Danworked his butt off and'sky-
rocketed way past me a couple years later.”
Since, Wirt has watched McCoy’s rapid
improvement. A ' - .
“He’s become a far better player than I
ever was, so I’m incredibly proud of him and
what he’s accomplished,” Wirt said. A

“That’s what usually separated the guys

that were on the national team and the guys '

that were on the junior team,” Andrew said.

“Dan saw that a lot of the guys on the na-‘

Sauer has coached the U.S. national
sled hockey team for the" past three sea-

_ sons, taking over after the 2010 Paralym—

pic Games.

“I tell them all the time. They have more
weapons than an NHL player has because
they can stick handle with both hands and
shoot the puck with both hands,” he said.

McCoy has made himself ambidextrous
through drilling. He’s now as good at han-

dling and shooting the puck with his non-

dominant left hand as with his right — a’
development Wirt has seen often.

“He’s probably one of the better guys
or one of the guys who uses it more fre-
quently on the national team right now,”
Wirt said. “[McCo37’s] ‘deﬁnitely a lotnbetter
defensively and a lot more responsible in
that end of the game, as well.” V

What’s'to come

Sauer has worked him as a defensive
forward against the other teams’ best
forward lines, but McCoy has -also killed
penalties and featured on the power play.

“He’s become an integral part of [the
team] ,” Sauer said.

Wirt sees the level of dedication McCoy
has demonstrated as imperative in the cur-
rent ultra~competitive climate of the sport.

“If you don’t have the time to commit to
it like that, 110 percent, you’re not gonna
make it,” Wirst said. “You really have to
commit your whole life ..to being a Para—
lympic sled hockey player. It’s gotten that
serious in this country.”

with the sport gaining popularity.
“Back in 2002, it wasn’t as big. It hadn’t taken

off yet,’f Wirt said. “Now it’s so big that if you don’t ‘

commit 110 percent, someone else is and they’re
going to take that spot from you.” .

The competition extends beyond tryouts. Only 5

15 players will dress for a given game and, as in
stand-upphockey, only sixtake the ice.

Ten other forwards made the trip, but McCoy
won’t dwell on what he cannot control. The attitude
he adopted after that all—important time seeing Wirt
with his gold medal has set him on the right path.

“I haven’t looked back since,” McCoy said; 3 I

That’s becoming truer than ever before. '
