Alliances, Isolation
Hold Center of Stage
As Congress Meets

By JOSEPH McCLOSKEY
There is a possibility that a
great portion of the American
"public was startled by the reve-
lation in last Sunday ’s Sun-
Telegraph_ to the effect that the
American people, from the
President on down, were used as
a pawn by the Allied Powers dur-
ing the World War.

The article announced the ex-
istence of a secret agreement
among the Allies providing for the
redistribution of European terri-
tory in the event of victory. And
the United States was kept in ig-
norance of the whole matter until
after the declaration of war.

The article may be taken as a‘
slap at the naivete of the Ameri-
can public as a whole, and of the
Wilson administration in partic-
ular, if we are to assume that they
really believed that the nations of
Europe were fighting to keep the
world safe for democracy and had
absolutely no desire for territorial
aggrandizement.

But I doubt if Mr. Wilson’s
worst critics would ever accuse
him of being that blind or gullible.

Talks At Student,
Faculty Forum

Addressing the fourth assem-
blyof SFA’s Student Faculty
Forum, Friday, Dr. James B.
Stinchcomb, assistant professor
and acting head of the depart-
ment of classics, will discuss
“Is There an American Lan-
guage?”

Meeting in 24 Cathedral at 1
o’clock, the forum will be open
to all students and faculty mem-
bers at the University. In line
with previous meetings in the

In reamy, coming as it did on} series, which introduced faculty

the day before the opening of the
special session of Congress, the
article may be construed as the
opening barrage in the war to keep
the United States free from the
entangling alliances which have
worried American politicians,
orators, statesmen, and legislators
since the days of Washington.
The isolationists fear that Presi-
dent Roosevelt may appear before
the Congress in the same frame
of mind as that in which he de-
livered his now-famous quaran-
tine speech at Chicago, denounc-

.‘ing Japanese aggression and in-

viting cooperation in suppressing
further Japanese invasions.

In other words, the present spe-
cial session, called primarily to
deal with the business situation,
may develop into an oratorical
festival on the merits and demerits
of isolation as a feature of Ameri-
can foreign policy.

The Profit Motive . . .

If such becomes the case, the
members of" Congress would do
welllto remember that the United
States has moved a long way since
the days of Washington; that wars
are fought not only with men, but
also with money; and that,'as long
as American capitalists and finan-
ciers have money, they will use it
wherever it will bring the greatest
return. And the munitions indus-
try is_;very proﬁtable.

',VAll “of which. leads to a con-
sideration of abandoning a policy
of isolation in» favor of er policy of
cooperation with England and
Russia in an effort. to preserve
world peace.

For example, there is reason to
believe that Wilhelm would never
have given Austria a blank check,

had he known definitely that Am-;,

erica would come into the war on
the side of the Allies.

And there is reason to believe
that none of the war-hungry na-
tions of Europe today would \be
willing to stack up against a
Soviet—Anglo-American combine.
It wouldbe too much like Shady-
side Academy including Pitt
among its football opponents.

 

Junior Coeds

Hold Meeting

,John Paul Baker, BA38, will
speak on China at the ﬁrst class
forum for junior women, Mon-
day.

. Baker spent last year as an ex-
change student at Lingnan Uni-
versity in Canton.

“The discussion will be illus-
trated with motion pictures,”
says Betty Adams, C, president
of the class, “and because of its
pertinence to the present Far East
situation should be of interest to
us all.”

‘Women may bring their lunch-
es. The room Will be announced

Mrs. Lissfelt
Directs Choral

Mr_s._ Mildred C. Lissfelt has
been appointed director of the

Women’s Choral, replacing Mrs.,

Gertrude Ayars who left the Uni-
versity recently to take over the
choral at Pennsylvania College for
Women.

In addition to receiving a bach-
elor of music degree from the
Teachers’ college at Columbia
university, Mrs. Lissfelt has stu-
died‘ at the Eastman School of
Music in Rochester, New York;
and until recently has been teach-
ing music in Pittsburgh.

members presenting and leading
discussion of their subject, Dr.
Stinchcomb will devote half the
time of the meeting to his ad-

dress, and half to student and
faculty questioning.

His analysis will center upon
the departures by Americans from
the English of Oxford. Current
theories, including the recent
“The American Language,” by H.
L. Mencken, have indicated that
America is developing a distinct
idiom and a re—adapted phonol-
ogy.

Specializing in the classic lan-
guages, Dr. Stinchcomb has been
interested in the linguistic over-
tones developing in America. He
will present his thories and the
theories of other linguists, sug-
gest possible developments, and
open the meeting to forum discus-
sion. '

Previous speakers in the forum
series have been Dr. Carroll R.
Daugherty, professor of econom-
ics; Philip C. Elliott, assistant
professor of ﬁne arts; and Dr.
Oliver L. Reiser, associate pro-
fessor of philosophy.

University
To Exceed

Fund Goal

Students Keep
Dollar Average

Set By Quick

Student response to the Com-
munity Fund solicitation dur-
ing the second-hour classes
Monday indicate that students’
will probably exceed their
quota of $2,700.

J . G. Quick, registrar and
general chairman of the cam-
paign, declaies, “The results of
the ﬁrst day of the student cam-
paign were most gratifying. The
students manifested a ﬁne spirit
in their generosity, as reflected by
the fact that an“ average of about
a dollar per student subscriber
was apparent when the envelopes
were checked in the treasurer’s
office.” _

The total amount subscribed by
the students the ﬁrst day has not
as yet been reported, but it will
be added to the report which will
be rendered by Mr. Quick in the
campaign headquarters today at
noon.

Latest reports on the faculty
campaign show that yesterday at
noon a total of about $3,500, or
nearly 50 per cent, in subscrip-
tions had been received. The fac-
ulty campaign, which began No-
vember 8, has a quota of $7,300.

Mr. Quick adds, “It looks as
though we would receive sub-
scriptions from a larger number
this year, and early predictions
point to going over the top, or
exceeding the student quota of
$2,700.”

Senior Photo Record
As Campaign Closes

Six hundred twenty-eight
senior photographs taken by
last Monday ‘evening, and 75
more by 6 o’clock this evening
will go far toward making The
1938 Owl “the best ever,” Sam
Werlinich, BA38, business
manager, declared l\Ionda_v as
he officially closed the circulation
campaign.

The estimate of 75 more pic-
tures to be taken yesterday and
today was made by Mr. Daumont,
of the Photo-Reﬂex studios, re-
calling the late rush for pictures in
previous years.

If this estimate is correct, a new
high in Owl circulation records
will be set. This will make The
1938 Owl a bigger book and will
greatly 'assi'stin making the cur-
rent issue truly representative of
University life. ,, ,

“Seniors who have -‘not as yet
had their pictures taken should go
down to the Phéoto-Reﬂex studios
during their first free hour today,”
Weflinich said. ""‘There will be a
last minute rush, but the studio is
quite prepared to handle it effi-
ciently.”

Photos will be taken until 6
o’clock this evening. Seniors are
asked to return their proofs before
Friday; otherwise the studio will
decide which picture will be pub-
lished in The Owl.

Tichenor Upholds
Co-Operative Plan

In City Sell Oil,

Gas, Groceries

By ROBERT ADAMS

As the middle way between
Communism and Fascism, the con-
sumers’ co—operative movement
will succeed in America because
it is a “better way” of meeting the
needs of the country.

Such is the opinion of George
Tichenor, Pittsburgh manager of
the Ohio Farm Bureau mutual in-
surance company, who discussed
“The Co-operative Answer to Eco-
nomic Confusion” at Inquiry
Forum Monday.

“The co-operative movement is
an evolutionary process, not a re-
volutionary one. We’re not going
to put anybody out of business by
edict. But we are going to succeed,
with each member having a share
in the savings of co-operation,”
said Mr. Tichenor.

Since the laissez-faire period in
business has passed, explained the

Consumer Clubs '

speaker, America is faced with
the problem of securing group ac-
tion of one kind or another in eco-
nomic life. At the present time,
there is a question whether Am-
erica is firmly emerging from the
last depression or entering upon
a crisis worse than the one which
began in 1929, he continued.
CO-OPERATIVE PRINCIPLES

“This crisis is the borderline be-
tween tragedy and opportunity,”
Mr. Tichenor declared. “To escape
from it, we must secure that kind
of group action which is best, for.
the whole of society.”

After tracing the development V

of the consumers’ co-operative
movement, which began in Roch-
dale, England, in 1844, be outlined
the basic principles of consumers’
co-operatives.

“First, membership in the co-
operative must be open to every-
one, without regard to class or
creed. Second, a program of edu-
cation must be carried on. Third,
goods should 'be.sold at prevailing

ANNED from the airways of a National
Broadcasting Company ’s network last week
was an address by General Hugh Johnson. P
While there are times when the bombastic

‘ General would do well to stay 0d the air, we

can see no reason why the talk in question was
barred. ,

Its subject matter concerned venereal clis—
eases, and its content struck an intelligent note,
towards a po‘ssi'b1e’ afttitude for the A\n1e[rican
public to" take. It Was’ in full measure an edu-

‘ _ cational consideration of the subject, and it
‘ contained much inforniation which IS not usual-

ly available‘ to the public in our popular peri-
odicals. . , .

Just why NBC saw ﬁt to ban the address is
beyond conjecture. But, no doubt, t-he delicacy
..of the radio audience‘ must. be preserved. There
seems to be no place on the air for educational.
progranis. ‘ ’ ~ ‘

Subtle Smoothness  .    I
Wins The Gals

"'GA_IN we are disillusioned. \Ve have al-
-ways believed that the .Princeton boys
In fact, all the boys -
in the Eastern Ivy League are supposed to be
rated by all the girls as the last Word in
sopliistiycation, savior faire, elan, etc. Any col-
siege m_an_ operating from west of the Alleghen-

_ ies. is a barbarian.

Now comes word that two Princeton sopho-
rniores have formed a Lonely Hearts Club to
:shorten the distance between their school and
Vassar. They published an ad in t_he Vassar
mewspaper: ‘ A

“Hundreds of men are lonely at Princeton.

‘Are you lonely too? Find your post box lover

by writing the Lonely Hearts Club, 181 Little
Hall, Princeton, N. J. No fee. Everything con-
ﬁdential. ”

And it seems to be working. One of the or-
ganizers stated: * t '

“It is not a joke because there are too many
letters. The club is not out to make any money .
or anything like it. It acts as an introduction
service for desirous parties in both instances.”

’l‘hat’s coming right out into the open, isn’t
it‘? Can you wonder that the Princeton boys ,

For The Very Young
‘By Milton G. l

To the Days Gone by, when Man Could Have
Lots of Fun without Making Excuses to Anyone;
in Fact, to the Days when Virtue of a Sort Was
Its Own Reward.

Within the dim and dismal, dreary past,

when man was animal, a mighty brute,

he fought among the members of his caste

to win his woman. In his mad pursuit
« of primal urges (aims he understood

and followed with a. vengeance and a will)
. his tribesmen noted him and called him “good”
and gave him credit for a worthy skill.

But -now,‘ when man would rise above his mates,
the primal ways must go, and in their place

the scale must judge between the ﬁner weights

except by virtue of the tete-a-tete.

Chavez Leads  
Fifth 
 /IiI,i"ce Beno7V"1'tz,

under Carlos Chavez, the séoond director of the
reorganized" Pittsburgh symphony, the orchestra

will play its ﬁfth concert of the season on Thurs- ..

day and Friday. - .

One of Mexico’s forem-ost‘ directors and com-
posers, Chavez was named director of the National
Conservatory of Music in 1928. As- ‘revolutionary
7i‘r-'1’ action as in music, he completely changed the
t’e"achi-'ng.meth'ods of the Conservatory-.

On a yx-earls sabbatical leave, he conducted. the
Boston and Philadelphia orchestras before his pres-
ent'- appearance here.

l5n‘te‘r'es’t‘ed" In M oderns

He‘ has planned an unusually varied program for
his next concert, which includes Mozart’s Overture
“Marriage of Figaro;” the Sinfonia in B flat major
by Bach‘. R.avel’s “Daphnis and Chloe” Suite No. 2;
and Tschaikowsky’s Symphony No. 6 in B Minor,
Opus‘ 74-.

The inclusion of Ravel’s “delicately wrought
ballet” is in keeping with Chavez’s interest in the
modern» composers. Ravel’s “Bolero” was the high
spot of last week’s program. ’

The hypnoticrhythm kept pounding, "pounding
on the sainethenie as one instrument after another
picked.up the melody. Finally the entire orchestra
combined the separate melodies into a tremendous-
ly exciting climax. Amusing was the fact that the
two saxophone players were recruited from the
Harlem Casino.

Own Composition Played

Haydn’s Symphony No. 85 was charmingly deli-
cate and naive. Its simple and beautiful melody
had a Dresden-like quality.

Chavez’s own composition “H. P.,” which was
played last week, was originally composed for ballet
and symphony.

It was performed" in Philadelphia under Stokow-
ski at a performance of the Philadelphia grand
opera company in 1932. The costumespand‘ sets for
the performance were designed by Diego Rivera,
‘the Mexican artist and a close friend of Chavez.
The first part “Danza Agil” contained many
startling, yet not unpleasant. discords. The “Tango”
section was outstanding. for its melodic rhythm and
crude vigour.

Chavez may be interested to know that he is one
of eight conductors caricatured in this month’s issue
of Vogue. In the sacred company of wild-haired
Stokowski and baton-throwing Arturio Toscanini,
he is depicted ﬂoating in musical. ether.

term. It connotes much more thanit actually says, and thus it

is -used as an instrument of warf
litical battles. A

though they are proﬁt—making‘ in-

tions of truth upon which all par-
ties can agree.

NO FREE TRADE

It is urged that by giving pub-
lishers freedom from regulation
they will pursue the best interests
of society. Therefore, the public
safety as regards news. depends
upon the goodness of particular
editors and publishers.

It is a deposit of’ faith in them.
It is a negative rather than a posi-
tive thing. The pious, hope is that,
according to Mr. Justice Holmes’
.fli.-ctum, “truth will emerge from
[rec trading in the public market
of ideas.”.

Men, however, are not consti-
tuted inharmony with such a doc-
trine. ln particular instances and
at particular times, certain indi-
viduals believe that only those
things which they believe in. are
truths; that all else is a subtle or
gross prevarication _of reality.
Responsibility, then, in such cases,
on the part of an editor‘ or a pub-
lisher‘ is not to society, but to the
particular group or set of ideas of
which he is the representative.

It is without doubt impossible’
for individuals to be responsible to-
society in the abstract. They must,
ha.ve a more concrete image to‘
which they may render homage.

But’ as newspapers‘ are consti-
tuted, their homage is first of all
to the Pproﬁt-making proclivities
of themselves. That is," their first
purpose is to makernoney‘, and
secondly to “affect the public in-
terest” for good’.

papers should not be regulated.
The. principle ispgood, But if they
are‘ business enterprises rather
than newspapers they ought to be
regulated. The only way out of
the difficulty is either to regulate
them as they are or to change their
present basis.

‘ Thus, if newspapers are to claim
exemption from public control,
they must divorce themselves from
the profit-makers. Otherwise one
can only speak of the doctrine of a
free press with the tongue in the
cheek. i

In the rise of power of the new
party these opposition newspapers
will fight at every step, and after
the new party is successfully en-

sconced in power they will sabot-

age policies as muchias they are
able.

If the crisis is sufﬁciently acute,
that in if the economic measures
against proﬁt—making are pushed
to the extreme, the proﬁt-moti-
vated newspaper will be eliminat-
ed, both as a logical necessity of a
program and as a measure of safe-
ty for the ruling group.

_There is no other way out of
the dilemma for a free press. It
must, at least in the U. S., sub-

ordinate, if not eliminate the profit-

motive or ‘else it must prepare for
the axem-an.

§Student Translates  
Papers For Chinatown

By Gertrude Lieblich

Chinese residents of Pittsburgh regard the present Sinc-
Japanese conﬂict not as just‘ another war, but as a matter of
life or death for China, according to Bim Faye Yee, M39, native
‘,‘_The principle reason behind the war is the fact
that the Chinese have natural resources and wealth, and the
Japanese have not,” Yee explained.

Few Pittsburgh Chinese return to engage in actual ﬁghting

“because China’s greatest need is¢

go back. China is a young man’s‘ V

gineering not because I have had
any mining experience, but most
Chinese students take political
science and government study; a
few study engineering-, but hard-
ly any . choose, mining, engineering.
And if China is to progress, she

must develop her natural re-
sources.”
In the middle of the present

tremendous material development
of China, Yee believes it is un-
fortunate that a destructive force
such as war should occur. “But
we in Pittsburgh shall continue
to raise ﬁnancial help for China.”

Potts’ Yearling Cross-Coiintry
Team Captures Intercollegiate

Chainpionship By Decisive Margin

W’inning IC/'~'lA championships is getting to be a, habit with

the Pitt track department.

Monday afternoon i11 Van Cort-

landt Park, New York, the Panther freshmen cross-country
team ﬁnished first in the annual "yearling _thr'ee-mile run to

capture the second major I.C.

the Panthers.

In June the Pitt cinder team
won the intercollegiate track
championship in a meet held in
Randall's Island Stadium. One
month earlier, in May, a fast-

moving freshmen sprint relay
quintet won the Penn Relay
» event.

Jimmy Pott’s ﬁve-man crew
placed all of its men among the
first 22 ﬁnishers to give the Pan-
thers a total of 40 points, earning

.a decisive Victory. Nearest com-

petitor was little Alfred with 72
points. Penn State was third
with 85 and Manhattan, defend-
ing titlist for the past two years,
ended up in the fourth position
with a sum of 93 tallies.
ROLEN THIRD

Rodney Rolen, star of the un-
defeated Potts’ brigade, ran in
third place. The winning indi-
vidual run was made by William
Smith of Cornell. Bill Stern, Al
Boulanger, Ed Ammerman, and
Bill Nurmi all ﬁnished well up
among the leaders to bring back
to Pittsburgh the University’s
first triumph of this ‘nature.

Carl Olson's varsity crew did
not fare so well. An inexperienced
lot", they managed to grab a
twelfth place-. Zamborsky, head-
ing the Pitt caravan, was in the

This represented a fall from
the places they had been able to
secure in the past two years o_f
competition. Two years ago they
earned a fourth and last year a
ninth. However, they only had
one vete:-an on the team this sea-
son, Al Zamborsky. “

SPARTANS REPEAT

Michigan State won the varsity‘

team championship forsthes fifth
successive year, emphasizing. its
dominance in this sport.

Howard Welch, Cornell’s IC4A
two-mile champion, won the in-
dividual title, by covering the
ﬁve-mile course in 2.6 minutes and
54 seconds. In winning, Welch

through thiscolumn to announuce
that the gym will not be available
for basketball practice for any
organized group until after
Christmas vacation . . several
frats have asked for practice time
already and this is the reason for
refusal And not speaking
out of turn, it is hinted that the
intramural basketball champion-
ship game MIGHT be held as a
preliminary to a varsity game in
the stadium .

NEW LEAGUE

It has been a long time since
intramural sports has fostered a
new elimination tourney such as
that has received the back-
ing the Orientation league has
. . Mr. Corley, assistant to the
dean of men, Herbert Rackoff,
chairman of the Men’s Council
intramural committee, and Har-
vey Rooker, director of intramur-
al sports, are supporting it to the
last ditch . . And it is worth
every bit of this strong arming

. . for the ﬁrst time in Univer-
sity history the freshman is given
the opportunity to get into the
swing of intramural sports with-
out being affiliated with organiza-
tions outside of his classes . .

Not only the freshman but the
intramural program beneﬁts by

With preliminary training well
|under way", there is still oppor-
ltunity for men who want to try
out for varsity boxing, according
to coach Jack Schricker. This is
particularly true in the 125, 155,
and heavy weight classes.

In the 125 pound class the only
veteran, Homer Livingston, has
not yet reported forpractice. John
Neurer, ’40, is the probable candi-
|date for the 155 pound class, un-
less Andy Ventresca, another
sophomore, succeeds in training
down to that weight. Vnentresca is

been getting along smoothly.

Intramural Plans

For Tournament
Mr. Harvey Rooker, director .of

. ' intramural sports, steps his exten-

sive intramural program into high
gear next week with another in-
novation—handball—for fraterni-
ties and- all independent and orien-
tation teams. .

Handball as a regularly schedul-
ed sport in University athletics is
something new and untried. As a
fraternity sport it is new. But
Booker believes it will prove a
popular experiment.

Carrying out his plan of over-
lapping and “something doing all
the time” Rooker has injected
handball to ﬁll in the lull between
touch-football and volley ball", two
well-known sport_s in intramurals.

SCHEDULE BEING PREPARED

A deﬁnite schedule is being pre-
pared for the fraternities and
orientation groups. The Independ-

ent league is as ‘yet undecided and ’

action cannot be taken until the
several teams return entrance
blanks. Rocker requests the teams
already entered in touch-football
to turn in entry blanks. . ,
Handball teams of singleshand
double-s are desired and any stu-
dent not affiliated with a team is
invited to enter, regardless. The

"entry deadline is Friday noon. It

is imperative‘ that the deadline be
observed and the schedule run
through without a hitch to make
way for volleyball before the holi-
days. , 4

ELIMINATION1 TOURNEYS

The three tour-neys will be elim-
ination affairs. . The purpose of
starting. handball before touch-.
football has run/through its string
is to take care of those teams al-
ready out of competition and to
give the paifticipants in the intra-
mural sports a more‘ diversiﬁed
program. _ I

The general lineup at present
calls for the handball tourney to
be completed by the ﬁrst of next

market prices. Fourth, savings
must be returned to members in
proportion to their patronage of
the co-operative.”

Membership in the Rochdale
type of co-operatives is held by
approximately 139 million families
scattered over the entire world,
Mr. Tichenor stated. In England,
one out of every two families holds
a co-operative membership, and
members are being added at the
rate of one each minute, he said.

SUCCESSFUL ‘CO-OPS’

Ten co-operative clubs are op-
erating in the Pittsburgh district,
with the new gas and oil group
the latest to be organized he af-
firmed. Local co-operatives include
a downtown grocery store and
other co-operatives selling all
kinds of clothing.

Chief sucess of student co-oper-

atives has been in the field of book"

stores and cafeterias, according to
Mr. Tichenor. In the League of
Student Co-operatives, which has
grown rapidly during the past few
years, are over 70,000 members.
Dormitories and cleaning and
pressing shops have also been suc-
cessfully operated by students as
co-operative enterprises, he point-
ed out.
PRICES KEPT REASONABLE

Accounting for failure of co-
operatives, Mr. Tichenor said,
“Two difficulties infest any co-
operative group. The first is the
indifference of the members or
managers. Second, co-operatives
may go into businss where there
is no real need for them.”

Although co-operatives do not
sell goods .below. cos-ts, their oper-
ations do serve to-keep prices of
other businesses. at a reasonable
.level, he explained.»

Theses Bool; J
For Craduatesi
Sent To Press

The Graduate School has sent
its 1937 bulletin of abstracts to
press, according to Dr. William

T. Root, dean of the Graduate‘

School.

A copy of the bulletin of ab-
stracts will be distributed during
the Christmas holiday to each
graduate and member of the fac-
ulty, while the remainder of the
bulletins will be sent to libraries
of the leading colleges and uni-
versities in the world.

This coming edition represents
13 years of constant improvement.
In 1924 a mimeographed appendix
was published, listing researches
in progress completed for doctors’
and masters’ degrees by the mem-

bers of the staff. It also listed

articles and books written by the
staff members.

Each year since then, a bulletin
has been printed, including the
appendix and containing abstracts
of theses and dissertations given
by those receiving degrees in Feb-
ruary, June, and August of the
same year.

Ripping

Biology Students
Cut ‘Conservative’

“Conservative,” the Rhesus
monkey, was peacefully jump-
in trees in, South America
when an expedition from the
..Denoy;eI_‘-Gebbert company, bi- '
ological supplies, from Chica-_
go, captured him.

“ C o n s e r v ative” howled
wildly all the way to Chicago.
How Denoyer-Gebbert shut
him up, nobody knows, but he
lay quietly embalmed in his
box of excelsior when he ar-
rived at the Universcity.

“Conservative” will never
know why he was made the
monkey for the biology de-
partment. The reason is that
he is easy to dissect and costs
only 20 dollars.

Now a member of the com-

parative anatomy ’ course,
“Conservative,”- along with
cats, dogﬁshes, turtles, and

pigeons will be dissected this
year by _two graduate stu-
dents, Richard Darsie of Beth-
lehem college, and Dale Smith
of the University.

Big Apple
Pitt Band Shows

A New Maneuver

There was quite a murmur
raised in the beginning of the
football season when the TCU
Band came up to Columbus
and paraded up and down the
ﬁeld between the halves of the
TCU-Ohio State game playing
some popular swing songs.

That they really didn't have
anything on the Pitt Band was
evident last Saturday. One of
the ﬁnest performances of a
thrill-packed afternoon was
exhibited when the Band went
into a new wing-back forma-
tion with Captain Flagg call-
ing the signals.

The Pitt Band’s “Big Ap-
ple” is distinctly something
new in halftime maneuvers. It
also served, after the game, as

a very effective victory dance.

Trade Decline

Decrease in Pittsburgh district
business continued last week for
the ﬁfth week but did not drop
off as much as the preceding
weeks, according to the report of
the University’s Bureau of Busi-
ness Research.

Last week’s decline resulted

primarily from a cut in the vol-
ume of trade, whereas industrial
curtailment was principally re-
sponsible for most of the slump in
business during October, the Bu-
reau announces.

The adjusted index of business,
according to the Bureau, stood at
90.2 per cent of the 1923-25 av-
erage; 2.4 per cent lower than the

last week of October.
