mouming faces of 250 friends
and students who came to
honor and remember Faith
Savasta.

A memorial service was held
in Heinz Chapel last night for
Savasta, a Pitt student who
died last week in an auto acci-
dent.

A great deal of comforting
went on among students who
came to the memorial service
—— people hugged, spoke in
whispers and cried as students
filed into the chapel.

Father Bryan Summers said
the number of students who
attended the service clearly
reflected the type of person

Faith Savasta remembered
through candlelight service

Candlelight illuminated the

that Savasta was.

“They’re here cause they
love and care for Faith, they
realize how important she
was,” he said.

The tragedy of Savasta’s sud-
den death was still evident in A
the faces of the students and to
the people who spoke at the
memorial service.

Cindy Goodman-Leib, who
spoke at the beginning of the
service, said that people should
accept the incidents that occur ‘
in life, no matter how tragic.

“As human beings, we
accept sulleﬁng and pain,” she
said.

Students spoke of the Faith
Savasta who they remembered,
many spoke of her friendliness
and the way she smiled.

Reuben Brown walks out of the courtroom after hearing that the crack cocaine charges had
been dropped, because there was not enough evidence.

By John Temple
Staff Writer

Unable to prove conclusively
that Pitt football players
Reuben Brown and Jermaine
Williams were aware that a
crack sale was being made in
their apartment, a city magis-
trate dropped the charges
against the men during yester-
day’s preliminary hearing on
the case.

Derrick Hicks, 21 former play-
er who allegedly sold crack to
a confidential police informant
just before the bust, will go to
trial facing charges of posses-
sion of crack and intent to
deliver.

City police detectives arrest-
ed the three men after finding
$7,100 to $14,500 worth of
crack cocaine in a raid on the
apartment of Brown
Williams on Jan. 23.

The raid was the result of a
three-week investigation of the
East Liberty apartment that
began after police received

Amiri Baraka, one of the
most celebrated African-
American poets of our time,
once said, “If you don’t have
political power, no matter how
great or rich you might be, you
have nothing. Political power is
the key.”

Baraka (formerly LeRoi

8:30 in the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room as part of the
Black Action Society’s corn-
memoration of Black History
Month. He is currently the
director of the Africana Studies
Program at the State University

Project jump Start proposals near deadline

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

Friday is the deadline for
the Provost committee’s rec-
ommendations of space allo-
cations for the projects sur-
rounding Governor Casey’s
Operation Jump Start.

Each committee will report
to Provost Henderson regard-
ing requests for the use of
space in the planned build-
ings which were made by
faculty, deans, student
groups and community rep-
resentatives at open forums

held by the committees in
late January.

One committee, the

Bellefield Hall renovation‘

group, has already submitted
its report to the Provost, urg-
ing him to turn the building
into a performing arts and
visual arts center. The pro-
posal would house the music
and theatre and studio arts
department as well as the
black studies department’s
Kuntu Repertory theater and
a dance studio for the
African drum and dance
ensemble, under the $8 mil-

lion granted for the Bellefield
renovation.

As for the other three sites
—— the $18 million Hillman
Library expansion, the $28
million academic complex at
Forbes and Bouquet Streets
and the construction of a $35
million convocation
center/basketball arena at a
site still to be determined.
The three committees will
have a bevy of appeals to
consider in their decisions.

The Academic Complex
Committee heard from over
15 groups during its open

house, each requesting space
allotments in the planned
90,000 to 100,000 square foot
complex, which is expected
to open in the fall of 1996.
For each group to be satis-
fied, the proposed two-block
complex would have to
extend nearly 20 blocks.

The University Times report-
ed that the departments of
computer science and psy-
chology appeared to be the
front-runners for space, but
added that faculty of arts and
sciences Dean Peter Koehler,

complaints of drug traffic in the
building.
Fifteen minutes before the

raid, a female undercover‘

police officer accompanied the
confidential informant to the
apartment where Hicks sold
her $40 worth of crack cocaine,
according to police, who said
Hicks admitted to making the
sale.

Police did not produce the
confidential informant at the
hearing, so they had no wit-
nesses who could testify
whether Brown or Williams
had been present during the
buy.

Although Brown and
Williams were found in the liv-
ing room of the apartment dur-
ing the raid, their lawyer said
there was not enough proof
that they were aware of the
sale.

“Clearly it takes more than
being in a house where drugs
are hidden to be guilty,“ said
Paul Gettleman, the football

IFC names
chairs and

J-Board
members

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

This year’s Inter-
Fraternity Council wasted
no time getting down to
business. In recent weeks,
judicial board members
and committee chairs have
been named, and the IFC
has set out to solve prob-
lems currently facing Pitt
Greeks.

This weekend is the first
step in solving these prob-
lems, according to IFC
President Jeremy Weiss of
Pi Lambda Phi. Members
from Pitt fraternities and
sororities will convene in
Hidden Valley for the
Presidents’ Conference to
discuss the most pressing
issues to the Greek coin-
munity. Weiss said the
conference is important in
guiding the course of
Greek life over the next
year

“We will be focusing on
the topics of rush, scholar-
ships, associate member-
ship programs and mem-
ber retention,” Weiss said.
“Hopefully, each house
will be represented.”

Weiss said that IFC has
already reached a decision
about its most prestigious

“I don’t know why they
didn‘t just charge lHicksl with
the theft during the first arrest,"
attorney Sumner Parker said
after the hearing.

Brown, a junior from
Lynchburg, Va., was one of the
most highly recruited defensive
linemen in the country during
his senior year in high school.
He switched to offensive line-
man in 1991 and earned third-
team I’reshman All—American
honors from 'l'/:>e.S‘/)m'/171g/\'e11’s.

The same year, Brown was
disciplined by the university's

Judicial I5o;Ird for allegedly

assaulting Stan Clark, a team
manager, according to the
/’1'I/s/Jmgtglv l’()s/—(;'(1Ze//e. Brown
allegedly knocked Clark’s head
against a wall after accusing
him of taking one of his jack-
018.

This season Brown earned
All-Big East Conference honors
at offensive tackle.

Williams, a senior tailback
from Detroit. Mich.. is
described by the athletic
department as "a swift, power-
ful back lwhol adds a valuable
dimension to Pitt‘s backfield."

According to the lﬁltsbztrgb

PERSPECTIVE

Thursday, February 11, 1993

PAGE 7

Send no troops, Bill

For we.ll over a year now, the former Yugoslavia has been
engaged in a bloody war. What was at one time a relatively suc-
cessful attempt at Communism has become a bitter reminder of
the destabilizing effects of nationalism. Children have died, geno-
cide has occurred and people are unable to leave their homes.

To the outside world the situation has been baffling. There is
no “common” enemy, thus, no army to defeat. There are few
clearly-defined boundaries between enemies, and this war is not
just a war between states. It is also neighbor against neighbor
and civilian against civilian. The most recent proposal of Lord

/ David Owen of Britain and Cyrus Vance of the United States to

end this war has at least met with some — albiet minor —— suc-
cess. Still, the war continues and a permanent solution seems
light years away.

Determined to play a role in ending this bloody battle,
President Bill Clinton has offered ground troops as peace keepers
in Bosnia—Her'/.ogovina. The proposal was a major policy shift

from the previous administration and depends upon the conclu--

sion of the Owen-Vance peace accord. It seems evident, howev-
er, that the Serbs, Croats and Muslims are far from reaching any
kind of armistice soon.

Even if an armistice was reached, the sending of troops would
be premature. In January 1992. the war between the Serbs and
Croats ended. Yet the president of Croatia continued to threaten
the United Nations by demanding that Serbia return Croatia’s
Serbian held territories. A few weeks ago President Tudjman of
Croatia held true to his word, Croatian troops crossed U.N. cease-

fire lines and pushed the Serbs back over a long front in the _

western Krajina region of Croatia. Such an action shows the deli-
cate nature of Serb/Croatian peace. Even if a military solution
was clear, the only way to keep the pot from boiling over would
be to achieve a psychological victory that would allow these peo-
ple — the Serbs, Croats and Muslims —- to live together once
again.

Despite the fact that thousands upon thousands of people are
dying in the former Yugoslavia, the sending of U.S. troops could
prove disastrous. The United States has little self-interest in this
region, and despite the fact that they had none in Somalia as
well, the situations are vastly different. True, both have humani-
tarian interests at stake, but intervention in Somalia could be
undertaken with only a minimal risk to American soldiers. The
same thing cannot be said of the former Yugoslavia. As a result,
we should stay out. The possibilites of a long-term commitment,
and many American lives, are too great of a risk.

Salute to volunteers

Three cheers for the Pitt undergraduate students serving as
volunteer tutors in the Hazelwood School District. The univer-
sity’s School of Education has developed a student volunteer
service that places 45 Pitt undergraduates into three Hazelwood
schools for one-on-one tutoring. Two days a week they help
these young students with their homework and study habits.

The School of Education deserves praise for implementing
such a plan. At a time when there is much talk about school
reform and declining educational standards, these volunteer
students aren’t just talking about action — they’re living it.
These students are not receiving credits for their tutoring, nor
are they getting paid in dollars.

Virtue is its own reward. Education is not limited merely to
the classroom. Both the students of Hazelwood School District
and of the University of Pittsburgh will learn from one another.
These middle school students are not learning only arithmetic
and reading skills but also what it means to be a positive role
model.

Telefact makes The Pitt News offer

As student coordinator of
Telefact, I would like to extend
an invitation for you to volun-
teer an hour at Telefact. I can
see from your article that you
do not have a full grasp of
what Telefact was set up to
accomplish.

Telefact is a service which is
run by students, to assist the
student body with cutting
through the red tape of this big
university. We do not put stu-
dents on hold because we want
students to hear us working.
We are not a typical depart-
ment that puts you- on hold so
we can finish eating our lunch-
es or finish telling a co-worker
what happened over the week-
end. If an operator is with
another caller, then the opera-
tor will ask politely if you
could please hold. You may
hear other calls being answered
because more than one opera-
tor is necessary to handle the
intense volume received at
Telefact. I might add that in
January we answered over
11,000 calls.

The Pitt News staff is a fre-
quent caller at Telefact. Daily
we see in The Pitt News facts
which we researched the day
before. Although Mr. Diersen
might have a problem with
Telefact, it seems that the rest
of the Pitt News find us a quick
and invaluable resource at the
university.

As I stated earlier, please feel
free to contact me and you can
see for yourself what our ser-
vice is all about.

Family leave bill wrong

I disagree with your Feb. 8
editorial, “One for Clinton.” It is
is wrong for the federal govern-
ment to force employers to
provide their employees with
family leave. '

This is supposed to be a free‘

country. Relationships between

human beings should be based
upon voluntary associations.

If two consenting people vol-
untarily agree to enter into an
employer/employee relation-
ship that does not include a
family leave provision, then
why should the government
prevent them from doing so?
Why should their activity be
outlawed? Why should they be
labeled as criminals?

Israel represented incorrectly

Paul Walker implies  Arabs
living in the “occupied lands”
have been deprived of a vote.
The fact is, the Israeli govern-

___ﬁ_
r ‘ 5

Q.

ment has offered full- fledged.

Israeli citizenship to all
Palestinians. Citizenship
includes the right to vote. The
Palestinians rejected the offer.
Thus, they have no vote. Non-
citizens living in any nation do
not have the privilege to vote.

If people take to the streets
inducing violence on innocent
civilians, as well as soldiers sta-
tioned by orders, that is consid-
ered terrorism. Obviously, the
repercussions against terrorism
will be severe in any society. It
is a government's responsibility
and duty to protect its citizens
and punish terrorists.

He says, “Their children
could have their bones system-
atically broken by Israeli sol-
diers for something as minor as
throwing a rock.” In Gaza and
the West Bank parents
encourage children to throw
rocks at soldiers, for one
wouldn’t expect to see a sol-
dier retaliating at‘a child.

Enough children throwing
rocks at soldiers will prove to
be a difficult situation to man-
age. The soldiers will go after
the rock throwers in self-
defense only. Rocks striking the
human body can result in
paralysis, blindness and even
death.

‘Many soldiers have been
killed as a result of rocks strik-
ing them. The soldiers only go
after children once the children
go after the soldiers.

As for, “Arabs have been
denied an education because
they made the mistake of exer-
cising their right to protest,”
this is the most inaccurate, false
and ignorant statement I have
ever read in my life. Perhaps it
should be pointed out that
before the West Bank was in
Israel, it was part of Jordan 
Under Jordanian control,
Palestinians lived in horrid con-
ditions. King Hussein even
ordered his army to open gun-
fire on Palestinians living in
refugee camps. Once the land
was turned over to Israel, the
Israeli government allowed
Palestinians to establish their
own universities.

He also writes, “To be born
an Arab in Israel is to be born a
suspect.” This is another gross-
ly incorrect statement. There
are plenty of Arab-Israeli citi-
zens, many of which are
prominent and well-respected.
Not all Arabs are involved in
the intifada. To be born an
Arab is not to be born a sus-
pect.

I find the last statement, 
Israeli’s hold the power and the
Arabs don’t” to be ironically
funny. Israel is the tiny single
Jewish nation surrounded by
hostile Arab nations in a corner
of the world where anti-Jewish
feelings rage highly. The whole
world looks for every opportu-
nity to come down against this
small yet strong nation.

Exploring the frozen dep

By Lori M. Bossert
Staff Writer

Terra Nova, by Ted Tally, is
a tortured play that explores
the depths of honor, ambition
and survival with gripping
honesty. Set in the frozen
wastelands of Antarctica, it
chronicles five men’s doomed
journey to the South Pole and
back.

The men are racing against a
team of Norwegian explorers
to be the first at the South
Pole. The Norwegians are
using dog sleds, while the
English are pulling their sled
by hand. Both teams must
travel 800 miles either way,
with no shelter and tempera-
tures of minus five‘and below.
It would appear to be an
impossible task — and for
these men. it was. All five
English explorers died on the
return trip. However, the men
face these impossible odds
with courage. and tenacity,
stemming mainly from their
leader, Robert Falcon Scott
(David White).

This chilling tale is told
episodically, interspersed with
scenes from Scott’s past and
his present struggle with his
conscience. Scott’s wife (Ilona
Haris, as Kathleen) is the voice
of his past, giving us insight
into the kind of man who
would dare take this type of a
journey. She appears from the
icebergs, chiding Scott for
leaving his own dinner party
or reading “letters” to him in
her journal. His adversary and

leader of the Norwegian team,
Roald Amundsen (Carl
Flanigan), becomes the voice
of many of Scott's conflicts,
allowing us to glimpse his
inner thoughts as he battles
-both nature and conscience.
The ensemble playing
among Scott’s men (Shawn
Ebbert, Scott Ferarra, Alan
Jestice and Glenn Lorenz) is
some of the finest I’ve seen
this season —— they are able to
create the kind of camaraderie
that can only exist between
people in this close, tense situ-
ation. As well, they never
break the illusion of being
alone in the bitter Antarctic —

their haunted eyes and con-
stant shivering will stay with
audiences for a long time.

Carl Flanigan is appropriate-
ly cold and rational as
Amundsen, contrasting well
with Scott’s idealism. The two
men’s imagined arguments
have a fine, taut edge as they
debate idealism and realism,
honor and survival. Ilona Haris
excels as the passionate
Kathleen, providing brief
respites from the strained
drama of the Antarctic explo-
ration. The energy she brings
to this role is exactly right, cre-
ating a strong and vital charac-
I61‘.

At the center of this drama is
David L. White as Scott, a man
obsessed with his own ideal-
ism and his struggle to over-
come mediocrity. Scott must
have been an extraordinary
man, and White is an extraor-
dinary actor, who is more than
just capable of this role. His
energy never fails, pushing the
emotional limits of both cast
and audience. The restrained
force with which he plays this
role is electrifying, allowing us
to meet this giant of a man.
Equally impressive is his versa-
tility as an actor — it’s hard to
believe that this intense man is
played by the same actor who

   

ths of survival in Terra Nova

gave us Feste the fool in
'l'we,//lh Night. He I/ICVCF fails to

' impress me.

The technical crew’s contri-
butions to this piece also add
to its success. Sounds of the
Antarctic wind underscore
many scenes, and cold blue
light suffuses the all-white set.
Scenic designer Karl Kelley has
created an environment that is
both simple and effective.

Donna Doskalakis’ costumes‘

also contribute to this effect.
Her designs for Kathleen are
stunning, and the entire cast
looks as though it has stepped
out of an F.dwardian
daguerreotype.

Director Gregg Dion and his
company of actors and design-
ers have created an awesome
show. This is a hushed, tense
drama that takes its real fire
from the emotional energy of
its company rather than from
the obviously dramatic situa-
tion. Both director and cast do
a fine job with a wordy script
(much of it appears to be
straight from primary sources

and journals), keeping the

pace swift but not rushed. The
abject horror of their experi-
ences (which included frost-
bite, gangrene, madness and

starvation) fuse with Scott’s’

growing feelings of failure and
constant ethical dilemmas to
create an unforgettable
evening of theater.

With a simple plot, Johnny Stecchino makes mistakes the fun

By Rob Penman
Staff Writer

The following are scattered
notes, grounded in the first
person, for the standard why
see/why not to see _/ohhny
Stecchino. '

My first exposure to
writer/director and star of

,/ohnrz_)t Stecchino, Roberto

Benigni, was from films of
New York Lower East Sider
Jim Jarmush. In Dozmt By
Law, Benigni co—stars with
musical giants Tom Waits
and John Lurie as fellow
inmates in the Louisiana
State Penitentiary. It’s there
in lockdown that the very
lost Italian native befriends
the street grizzled Waits and
Lurie. Watch for the scene
‘where Roberto learns the
American childhood chant: “I
scream. You scream. We all
scream for ice cream!”

The other and more recent
jarmush film Benigni was
featured in was Night On
Earth. The film was a series

of vignettes, also featuring
Ginacarlo Espozito and
Winona Ryder, about one
night’s happenings in five
different cities. Benigni plays
a hyperactive cab driver in
Rome who gives a Catholic
confession to his fare, a
dead Father. It’s Catholic
adolescent repression
recounted in a way that left
me speechless.

Ok, so now it’s time to
analyze ,/_ohnn_y Stecchirzo,
which in Italian means
Johnny Toothpick. What we
have here is the old'mistak-
en identity drill. Benigni
plays two roles: starting as
the kind, virtuous Dante who
lives by himself, drives the
local school bus for physical-
ly and mentally disabled
kids, one of which is his
best buddy. Together they
conspire to do mischievous
things such as stealing fruit,
and allowing the kid to play
hookey. All is fun and play
for Dante until he encoun-

By Mike Sula
Staff Writer

The devil was in the details in the 1988
Dutch film .S'[)oor/oos, directed by George
Sluizer. In it a man’s obsessive search for
his missing girlfriend provides an almost
interactive viewing experience for audi-
ences that were haunted by the memory
of an attractive young woman who van-
ished out from under the nose of her
boyfriend at a rest stop on the highway.

In The Vanishing, the American remake
of the latter film by the same director,
the audience,’ like an impressionable
tyke, is given the fairly tale treatment,
ostensibly so it doesn’t have nightmares.

The original, based on Tim Krabbe’s
novel The Golden Egg, employs a non-
linear unraveling of events in order to
disorient the viewer and place him in the
same sphere of confusion . as the
boyfriend. While this technique was
employed with less intensity than Atom
F.goyan’s equally foreboding The
Adjustor, Spoorloos made no apologies
for being something of a challenge to its
audience. It demanded a small level of
involvement that paid off at its grim, yet
cosmically satisfying end.

The Valrzzshirzg assumes that its audi-
ence cannot handle calculated disorienta-
tion. lmmediately, parameters of Good
and Evil are established in the characters
of Jeff T-larriman (you can see Alaska
over the flat tundra of Kiefer Sutherland’s
performance) and Barney (nice job by
Jeff Bridges, combining elements of
scholarly introspection with strains of the
village idiot).

While Jeff and his pouty squeeze Diane
(Sandra Bullock) squabble, coo and
swear forever their love shall be, Barney
tinkers with a sinister plot at his log
cabin in the woods. His meticulous
attention to detail establishes a scientific
detachment that places him above the
stock Hollywood psycho. Unfortunately,
much of what Barney is all about is laid
out swiftly and neatly. When the experi-
mental nature of his crime is revealed
too soon, the film shifts from a gripping
psychological profile to that tired old
dichotomy between Good and Evil that
prevails over most of American entertain-
ment.

It is understood that Barney is about to
kidnap someone, and it is only by
default that he grabs Diane. The arbitrary

Soundings

Fastbacks
Zzic/eer
Sub Pop

There once was a time when
underground bands played
music filled with fury and pas-
sion. The sound wasn’t just a
rehashed idea that had already
been beaten to death. There
was something original, some-
thing genuine to it. When
played right, it could move
mountains.

The Fastbacks play that kind
of music. The group formed
back in 1979, at a time when
this music was in its prime. And
Zucleer shows the quartet,
thankfully, hasn't changed a bit
since its origin.

The songs on Zucleervharken
back to punk rock’s salad days,
when shorter was better. Six of
the album’s 14 songs clock in
under two minutes, and the
whole album lasts just a little
over half an hour. Most of them
segue together, creating a non-
stop flow of energy.

Guitarist Kurt Bloch’s affinity

Shorter is better for Sub Pop and the Fastbacks.

for fast tempos might have
made the first side sound like
one big song if he was not such
a good writer. Beneath the
rapid-fire riffs lay well-con-
structed pop masterpieces with
raunchiness coming from the
guitars and occasional chiming
organ.

But thetreal force in the
songs comes from bassist Kim
Warnick’s vocals. She doesn’t
simply wail, she really sings.

Her strong alto cuts through the
guitars in a penetrating way,
whether she's spewing venom
(“Believe Me Never”) or being
confessional (“When I’m Old”).
On “All About Nothing,”
where the band jettisons the
drums and takes the tempo
down, Warnick and guitarist
Lulu Garguilo harmonize beau-
tifully, vaguely recalling ‘50’s
“girl groups” like the Shangri-
Las. The song makes an inter-

esting break from the rest of the
album and serves as an appro-
priate end to the album’s first
side.

Zuc/reefs lyrics explore
themes similar to these girl
groups: relationship problems
and alienation. However‘, Bloch
writes with depth never heard
in a female bands from days
gone by.

Nothing is ever resolved in
the songs, of course. In fact, the
album ends enigmatically mid-

sentence. In the last song —‘

”That Was” —- Warnick walks
away from a' relationship, vow—
ing to do better next time. As
she trails off the last line, the
band slowly fades out.

Some of the songs seem like
they express resentment the
band feels at not being recog-
nized while other bands in their
area becoming household
names. “Please Read Me," a
1967 Bee Gees tune, sounds
like a plea for attention. “They
Don’t Care” could be about fel-
low scenesters like Nirvana or
Soundgarden, who came up

through Seattle afte.r the
Fastbacks and have become
more popular.

Whether or not the Fastbacks
feel this way, the group has
every right to complain. It
should have received due
recognition a long time ago.

Albums like Zucleer save
lives.

Wallace the pleasure. Wallace
uses various samples in the
beginning o'f several songs. He
takes a tab from "Apocalypse
Now,“ using a druggy piano
sample and sounds of underwa-
ter bubbles. He also removes
the cheap distortion effect that
Ned’s beat to death on the pre-
vious album. But Ned’s still has
the recognizable two-bass gui-
tar lineup.

“Suave and Suffocated” con-
tains the “Apocalypse Now"
sample, from the helicopters
scene. This song screams
“MF.DlOCRF.!” Both the guitar
and basses are (lead. However,
it shows the significant devel-
opment of Ned's new sound.
"Walking through Syrup,” the
sec()nd single, resurrects my
feeling for the album, the com-
plete opposite from the last
song. It has catchy lyrics, “You

mosh jam. The best song of the
album.

“Legoland” is a great example
of the band growing. _]onn, the
singer, has matured, he doesn’t
shout most of the lyrics any-
more. The guitar emits the long
drawn out chords, while one
bass supplies a rhythm and the
other plays a rigid bassline.
“Swallowing Air” and ‘‘\Who’s
on First?” rate among other typi-
cal songs from the album. But
the latter has a top acoustic riff
at end of it. “Not Sleeping
Around,” the first single, is

‘another mediocre song. “You

Don’t Want to Do That,”
“Tantrum” and “Inact” are first
rate songs. Harmonies and a
simple discussion of relation-
ships are the essence of these
songs. ‘

“A Leg End in His Own
Boots” is as slow a song as
Ned’s has ever done. The bass-
es marry a great riff with a
smooth and tuneful sound, the
guitar adds a little feedback and
the lyrics are great. The song
ends with “Any reason for your
breathing/ Just eludes me.”
“Spring” is an unusual song,
taking on some heavy influ-
ences from the ‘70s, beginning
with a heavy reverse guitar. But

we [Canaries] suck— or that the
Don is so good. I guess people
feel cheated if they think
they’re going to see the
Canaries,” Che Said. “People are
pretty stupid.”

Whether Damon’s paranoid
complex is warranted or not,
the chips are stacked in the
Canaries’ favor. One of the few
all—star rocker lineups in town
(or another example of the
incestuous lineage in the family
tree), the members of Thee
Canaries read like a home-
grown who’s who: Damon on
guitar (drums for Don
Caballero), Karl Hendricks on
bass and Noah Leger (of the
defunct Northern Bushmen) on
drums.

Their debut, 11-song effort on
Mind Cure, (the impetus for the
resurrection of Dave Martin's
label) listens like _a thick port. It
seems strange that a full-length
release would precede a 7-inch
(at least by Indie rock stan-
dards) in this age of swell sin-
gles, but as Damon said. “There
are a lot of bad singles out
there“ and he didn't want his
band to add to the deluge of
mediocre tiny vinyl. The busiest
drummer doubles as a growl-
ing, snarling, guitar spaying
front (back?) guy, while Karl
and Noah lend themselves to
creating heavy doses of spitting
hiss. spank and potency.

Obviously heavily influenced
by good and great big talent (of
that lighter-waving era), Thee
Canaries give it its Van Halen-
est, albeit muffled in the engi-
neering process. “I’)i’/.'/.y and
Stored“ is a stellar cut that
pours out Karl's hum and crack-
le. then erupts and warms like
a tame tantrum. “Toble\\'ee

Shooting woes cost women ’s hoops in 70- 53

~

By Jason Brame
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basket-
ball team lost its second
straight Big East decision by
dropping a 70-53 battle with
Villanova.

Once again, poor shooting
stink the Panthers as they
knocked down only 30.4 per-
cent of their shots, a figure
that will stand up favorably
against very few teams.

"We picked one of the
biggest games of the. year to
have the worst shooting night
we've had,” Pitt head coach
Kirk Bruce said.

The Wildcats brought an
offense into Fitzgerald Field
House identical to the one
they ran on Jan. 9 —— the last
time the two teams met. This
time, however. Pitt did not
match ‘Nova's cuts to the
hole and suffered a defensive
defeat.

“It’s the same offense they

ran up at Villanova and we
stopped it," Pitt head coach
Kirk Bruce said. “Up there
we didn’t allow them to
make passes, tonight we kind
of backed off. The first time
we played them they had
trouble running their offense
and tonight they had
absolutely no trouble running
their offense.”

“They set constant screens,"
Pitt forward _]onna Huemrich
said. “They had an offense
that was very effective
against the man Ito-man
defensel. It’s called a spread,
they set screens all over the
place.“

The first half was one of
the most erratic that Pitt has
had this season. Hitting only
25.9 percent of its shots. the
Panthers could get no kind of
run going offensively. Free
throws kept them in the ball-
game as they were six for
seven from the stripe.

It was a combination of

awful shooting and strong
‘Nova defense that kept Pitt
from ringing up large offen-
sive numbers.

Most notably, the ‘Nova I)
shut down Huemrich, Pitt's
leading scorer, who notched
only 14 points. eight in the
second period.

“They played really tight
defense on me," Huemrich
said. “I couldn’t get the ball,
and when I did I forced some
things I shouldn’t have
because I was frustrated."

The ‘Cats’ 46.2 mark led to
only an eight-point advantage
on the scoreboard, however,
as the. Panthers limited
Villanova in its offensive
chances and went into the
half down by eight, 29-21.

Villanova had trouble han-
dling a Panther press that
helped keep the Wildcats
from running away with the
hallgamef Pitt showed defen-
sive intensity that caused

Wrestle hard.

A simple two-word phrase that can make or break
a wrestling team. An easy three syllable sound that
broke Pitt in its tough loss to Bloomsburg last week.

A phrase that, as the Panthers enter tonight's
match with 22nd-ranked lidinboro and Saturday's
meet with Clarion, will not be forgotten. instead,
wrestling hard is still the ingredient that Pitt head
coach Rande Stottlemyer knows can bring his
Panthers a nice one-syllable word — win.

“You have to wrestle hard, even if it’s a wrong
move sometimes it will work because you did it
hard enough,” Stottlemyer said. “You have to wrestle
smart too, l)ut wrestling hard is a must.”

Sometimes the wrong move won’t work, and that
was the case against Bloomsburg. ljncharacteristic
moves by senior Steve liudman at ISO pounds and

own,” Stottlemyer said. “Sometimes you have to cut
your losses and go from there.

‘‘I don’t blame them for the lBloomsburg] loss at
all, we win and lose as a team. I know if we contin-
ue to wrestle hard we can win.”

'lhat will be tested tonight as the Panthers (6-21,
1-2) once again travel to meet another liastern
Wrestling League opponent. Squaring off against the
22nd-ranked Fighting Scots of lidinboro, Pitt will be
in for another tight match.

‘‘I anticipate not as many tossups with Iidinboro,
but there’s not really any one key bout," Stottlemyer
said. “As a team, we have to go out at 118 and wres-
tle hard.” '

Going out at 118 and wrestling hard is what the
Panthers have become used to. Sophomore Mike

Continued from page 9

Interestingly enough, UNLV
and New Mexico State close
out the season head-to-head
in Las Cruces. And if you
haven’t watched _].R. Rider
play yet, you’re missing out
on life.

°How was Drazen Petrovic
left off the Eastern
Conference’s All—Star team?
How? First off, the normally
reliable NBA fans voted in
an undeserving Isiah
Thomas at guard and Scottie
Pippen at forward. Then the
coaches who picked the
reserves compounded prob-
lems by selecting only two
reserve guards for a 12—man
East roster. The NBA needs
to consider expanding its
All—Star rosters from 12 to
15. With the fan interest and
fast-paced action in this
game, even choosing 15
stars per side is tough.

- 0 Just wondering  how

many of the Eric Lindros
bashers would like it if their
every move was scrutinized
by the ruthless throngs of
media mongers looking to
constantly villify him. It’s a
safe bet that the very large
majority of those who rip
Lindros were not nearly as
mature as he is at age 19.
The recent trial to settle a
“dispute” between Lindros
and a 24-year-old woman
‘who accused him of pouring
and spitting beer on her is

yet another glowing exam-
ple of this media villifica—
tion. Despite the fact
Lindros did nothing wrong
or even unusual, the dam-
age done to his reputation is
irrevocable. Regardless of
the salary, the fame and the
lifestyle, he is a 19-year-old
kid. Unfortunately for
Lindros, too many people
forget that, and the scrutiny
is part of the baggage that
comes with this territory.
Still, the vultures went over-
board this time.

0 Not only is Charles
Barkley the Most Valuable
Player in the NBA this sea-
son, Sir Charles is also the
best player. Talk about
Michael Jordan, but Barkley
brings more to the floor
both skillwise and with
more intangibles than any-
one in the game right now.
His critics search high and
low for a knock in his game
and can’t find one, so they
resort to attacking him for
personality traits and con-
trive reasons to deny
Barkley his just due. In
Philadelphia, Barkley car-
ried the Sixers on his back,
scoring rebounding, passing,
playing defense and moti-
vating some less-than-
enthused teammates, yet he
received the rap that a team
built around him could not
win.

Now in Phoenix, he

enjoys the luxury of playing
with Kevin Johnson, Dan
Majerle, I)anny Ainge and
Richard Dumas, so Charles
realizes that many will
attribute’ his rejuvenated
play to‘ the supporting cast.
But any one. of those play-
ers will tell you, Barkley is
the sole reason for both his
and the Suns’ (an NBA best
34-9) success. What the sup-
porting cast allows him is
the ability to dominate the
game more subtlely, sitting
back to involve teammates
then turning it up in the
fourth quarter. In essence,
Barkley sacrifices his own
statistics for his teammates.
Would Jordan be content to
do the same? If you think
Barkley couldn’t score 35 a
night if he wanted to, you're
kidding yourself.

One facet of Charles’
game that has never been
questioned is his phenome-
nal ballhandling skills, but
linking Barkley to tough
defense is a new concept
for s_ome fans. At times,
Barkley’s defense in Philly
was a question mark, but
that was more a product of
the overall Sixers’ situation
— shoddy team defense and
Barkley’s frustration at the
lack of chemistry. Barkley is
the only man his size, possi-
bly in the history of the
game, to guard 7-footers.

Wrestling

Continued from page 9

- Moore has been wrestling well
. and getting the team motivated.

“Mike Moore has done a good
job lat 118l,” Stottlemyer said. “At
118 you want to create momen-
tum for the rest of the team.”

Against Edinboro, a Moore pin
would excite the whole Panther
squad.

“I think he lMoorel has 17 or 18
pins since he’s been here,”
Stottlemyer said of Moore‘s charge
leading Pitt “right out of the gate."

After Edinboro, Pitt gets a day
off to recuperate and gear up‘for
a Saturday night showdown with

EWL and Pennsylvania rival,

Cl;l1‘i()n.

“Always a tough match at
Clarion,” Stottlemyer said. “There
is nothing better to do in Clarion,
on a Saturday night, but go to a
wrestling match."

Having the rowdy home crowd,
the Golden Eagles will likely push
Pitt to its limits and maybe _to its
last match at the heavyweight
class.

If that happens, Stottlemyer

feels confident that Panther
heavyweight Pat Wiltanger will
get the job done.

“I like to have a good heavy-
weight,” Stottlemyer said of his
sophomore. “Wilt lWiltanger|
is always thereto pull it out for
us.

“A good start lMoore at 118i
and a good end [Wiltanger at
HWTI is what I like to have, we
call them the ‘bookends/”

If the “bookends” come
through, all Pitt has to do is wony
about the eight matches in
between.

Iiut Stottlemyer still feels confi-
dent.

“The guys have a lot of intensity
and enthusiasm,” Stottlemyer said.
"We’re climbing that ladder and I
hope this weekend we can get up
a few more rungs.”

Wrestling Wrap: Pitt will
return home for the first time
in three. weeks to take on West
Virginia Feb. 18 at Fitzgerald
Field House and Penn State on
the 2()th (at Connellsville High
School).

 

Pitt wrestling coach Rande Stottlemyer said he is confident that his heavyweight "bookend"
Pat Wiltanger will come through with a strong finish for the Panthers.

Tanner

ball days. “I called plays in
the huddle, and the coach let
me because they worked.”

While calling football plays
in high school, Tanners first
love was baseball and when
he played in the major
leagues (1946-1962) winning
was always on his mind.

“I always wanted to win,"
Tanner said. “It was inbred
in me, I used to dream about

it at night.”
Never being an All-Star
player, Tanner’s calling

remainedsomewhere else. It
was in the dugout, as a man-
ager, that Tanner would
prosper.

In 1970, when Tanner took
over the Chicago White Sox,
people started to notice his
skills for running a ball club.

After saving Chicago’s
falling attendance, Tanner
enjoyed a brief managerial
stint with the Oakland

Athletics in 1976. But when
Tanner had the opportunity

to coach the Pittsburgh
Pirates in 1977, he jumped at
the chance to return home.
With the Pirates poised to
make a run at the pennant,
Tanner was the key to
Pittsburgh’s success. The
most important tool Tanner
used to get the winning edge
was his relations with his

players.
“I communicated on an
individual basis,” Tanner

said. “I had 25 rules. one
rule for each player.”

Breaking the mold of the
“old—style” coaches who did
not relate as much to their
players, Tanner’s "new style"
paid dividends as the “\X’e-
Are—Family” Pirates won the
1979 \World Series.

“We were really a family."
Tanner said of his 1979 team.
“We were tough. and on the
field everybody was like a
brother."

But after two consecutive
losing seasons in Pittsburgh,
Tanner was let go in 1985.
Only three days later he was
coaching again, this time in
Atlanta.

Without much success in
Atlanta, Tanner was fired in
1988. But before Tanner left
the Peach State, he had
formed the basic structure of
the Braves teams that would
win back-to-back National
League pennants in ‘91 and
‘92.

Now in Milwaukee, Tanner
enjoys hitting fungos and
talking to the players. But
owning a baseball franchise,
and even coaching again, is
still Tanner’s aspiration.

So the Brewer scout con-
tinues to look for the right
job while helping Milwaukee
acquire young talent. Tanner
still wants to find another
niche in the game that means
so much to him.

“As long as I live I can
never give back to the game
what it has given to me,”
Tanner said. “I wanted to be
a baseball player, and I was
not coming back ‘til I made
the ‘Bigs.”’

Well the little boy made it.
And now the older, fatherly
man shakes a hand or two as
if to reassure all that Chuck
Tanner can still succeed in
his life called baseball.

Not merely guard
them but muscle and
reject them. If earlier
efforts against David
Robinson and
Hakeem Olajuwon
weren’t convincing
enough, then
Sunday's performance
against Shaquille
O’Neal left no doubt.
Charles outsmarted
and at times outmus-
cled the Shaq Daddy,
almost singlehandedly
fouling him out. The
121-105 Phoenix vic-
tory perhaps best
showcased the versa-
tility that makes
Barkley the best play-
er on the planet.
0 The firing of
California Coach Lou
Campanelli is disturb-
ing for so many re.a-
sons. The coaching
field is as fragile a
profession as any,
especially when unre-
alistic expectations
like those at Cal run
rampant.
0 Finally, congratula-
tions to one of the
greatest and classiest,
human beings ever to
grace professional
athletics —— Dr. J.
Before there was
Magic and Larry
Legend, there was the
Doctor. Julius Erving
was elected to the
Basketball Hall Of
Fame this week, and
for a person who
means so much to so
many both inside and
outside the basketball
community, it’s funny
how shallow many of
our memory banks
are.

With Jordan—mania
rampant, take some
time to remember the
man who innovated

skywalking, the grace-

ful one who did
things on the basket-

ball floor nobody ever

thought possible.
Revolutionizing the

gliding moves of Elgin

Baylor and Connie
Hawkins, Dr. J._
changed the entire
face of pro basketball
— both the way it
was played and the
way the public
regarded it.

All you need to see
is his famous base-
line—under—the—hoop—
swooping-one—hander
in the 1983 NBA
Finals that Magic
Jolmson still calls the
greatest shot he has
ever seen. Watching
footage of Dr. J. still
gives me chills.
‘Thanks Doc.

turnovers and hurries and
rushed the Wildcats into mak-
ing bad passes.

But when Bruce went to
the man-to-man, mostly early
in the first half to about the
10:00 mark of the period,
Villanova found the seams. In
this set, when ‘Nova players
went to the basket Pitt
defenders “played the person,
and not the cut," as correct
defense would dictate, there.-
fore allowing the ‘Cats to eas-
ily throw the ball inside
against a beaten defender.

The Panther press was
nowhere as potent in the sec-
ond stan‘/.a, as Pitt defenders
became lax in their up—tempo
defense.

“They seemed a little tired
out there,” Villanova’s Nikki
Benedix said.

Forward Denise Dillon led
the ‘Cats with 21 points, all in
the second half. She finished
four for six from the field and
an impressive 13 for 14 from
the free—throw line.

The loss lowers Pitt’s sea-
son record to 11-9, 6-6 in the
Big East. Villanova likewise
goes to 11-9, 7-5 within the
conference.

The Panthers next take on
the St. John’s Express on
Saturday afternoon at
Fitzgerald Field House. Pitt
hopes to avenge a 77-64 loss
to the Express on Super Bowl
Sunday.
