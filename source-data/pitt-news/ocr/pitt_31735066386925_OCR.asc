ce-T capitalist _o ueila

By Matt Groff

Asst. News Editor

-..-M.» .» .'-new-1

Rapper and movie star Ice-T
brought his message of racial har-
mony and criticism of the “the
system” to Pitt last night. .

“I’d like to see you guys
become Young Urban Capitalist
Guerillas,” he told more than 600 _
Pitt students who filled the
William Pitt Union Ballroom last 4 1
night. The star of films New _/acle
C1't_).', Ricochet and Trespass, Ice-T
recently released the book, The
Ice Opiniorz.

“[Young Urban Professionals]
5 forgot where they came
 from,” Ice-T said. “[Today’s stu-
3 dents] have to intellectually
undermine the system, but first
you have to go for the money and
make it to the positions of power.
When you make it, remember
compassion and what you stand
for.”

Ice-T, often the subject of criti-
cism for the vulgarity and
violence in his songs, said
his “hate for the system” came
from his four years in the Army,
not from his gang involvement at
Los Angeles’ Crenshaw High
 School.

 In the Army, Ice-T said people
treated human life like “little
pieces on a chess board.”

Student Health
Servicesto merge
with university
medical center

By Christine Hanna

 

l 3 Managing Editor

Because of increased tuition and the state of the
economy, the university has decided to, integrate Stu-
dent Health Services, normally under the Office of
Student Affairs, with the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center.

According to Robert G. Houston, executive assistant at
the office of the vice chancellor of Student Affairs, coin-
bining the two will put a hold on a fee increase for
health services. ‘

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor created a commit-
tee to review the possibility of the merger. Before winter
break, Houston said O’Connor received a recommenda-
tion that the two should merge, and in the. past couple of
weeks he has agreed to this change.

When students go to Student Health in the fall, they
will not be going to Brackenridge Hall but to the fifth
floor of the Medical Arts Building on Fifth Avenue next
to Mellon Bank.

According to Houston, this new facility will house
the Brackenridge Clinic, the Forbes Clinic and the
Support Services, which is currently in South Holland
Hall. ,

Houston said this new facility will not be small and
cramped, and it will be more adequate for the universi-
ty’s needs. He also said with the past fee increase, some
services were taken away and now will be restored
because of this merger.

“It proves to be a pretty good thing,” said Dr. Franklin
Carter, director of Student Health. Carter said the space
in the new facility would be double what they have
now.

Carter also said one main benefit of being tied
with UPMC is that Student Health would be hooked
up to its computer system. Now, Student Health
won’t have to phone and fax everywhere for out-
side results and specialists, but can go through the com-
puter.

Fraternity, sorority play
basketball to raise funds

By Mark Gordon -
Staff Writer Byjohn B. Moore
_ Staff Writer

A basketball was being bounced outside the William Pitt Union
yesterday for a cause other than Jerry McCullough setting up an
Eric Mobley dunk. ‘

Alpha Epsilon Pi, a Pitt fraternity, and Alpha Epsilon Phi, a Pitt
sorority, are two Greek organizations that are behind the Dribble-
a-T hon, a fund-raising event that brings in money for the American
Cancer Society.

“You just keep dribbling a ball all day long,” AEPi brother Scott
Stoner said.

The Greeks arrived on the front steps of the Union at 8:30 a.m. to
begin the event. Some passed the time by playing catch while oth-
ers just dribbled in place.

Last year the event raised over $250, a number that Stoner said
he is hopeful will increase this year. “We hope to raise as much as
possible, even more than last year,” Stoner said.

The brothers and sisters were having a good time working on
the event, despite waking up early and heading out to the cold
Pittsburgh morning.

“I was out there at 9:50 in the morning and it was freezing cold,
but it was for a really good cause and I think [the event] went really
well,” said Lauren Leiter, a sister of AEPhi.

Generations Together unites all  
ages for child development fiela’

Monday morning on the second floor of
the William Pitt Union, before the congratula-
tions and food were ‘served, 12 older
adults stepped forward to receive a certificate
representing their devotion in time and
effort to 120 hours of child development train-

Sally Newman, executive director of the
Generations Together program at the
University of Pittsburgh, said, “A lot of these
people never finished high school.” Yet they
were able to complete training that will qualify
them to gain employment in the child devel-

Newman said the participants are recruited
through the newspaper and other forms of the
media. For the past six or seven years, a cycle
of 10 to 12 older adults is trained in early child
development. There are two cycles through-

Of those who graduated from training this
week, Newman said virtually all will receive
jobs.

In 1979, Newman brought the Generations
Together program to Pitt.

“The university was interested in the new
roles of older adults in the community,” said
Newman.

“I came with myself and a small staff of a
couple of other people.”

In the 15 years that have passed, the pro-
gram has grown immensely. “We have grown
tremendously in 'who’s involved,” said
Newman. “We now do research around the
world.”

The program began as an Intergenerational
Studies program for the School of Education.
Some of the roles the program is responsible
for are to develop a generational program
model between the school and community
and to research the effects of these models.
Those involved with the program then must

Student Health recommends balanced diet

An apple a day keeps the
doctor away. Feed a cold, starve
a fever. Are these words of wis-
dom or hogwash? Facts or fic-
tion? Just what should we eat to
stay healthy in temperatures
below freezing? '

If you asked Steve, he would
tell you that he takes care of his
body and has a healthy lifestyle.
After all, Steve takes vitamin C
and zinc.

He also runs five miles every
morning, no matter what the
weather. On weekends he lifts
weights and swims.

Steve watches his weight by
skipping breakfast and snacking
on bagels and fruit during the
day. For dinner, he eats a fat-
free meal and washes it down
with Perrier water.

Periodica1ly— only twice
a month, says Steve — he
abandons his sparse diet and
goes on a fats—and-sweets
binge.

So why is Steve at Student
Health Service, feeling run-

down, with a stuffy nose and
chills for the second time this
month?

Steve’s health habits may
be doing him more harm than
good by putting

ner.

Eating a simple breakfast, like
cereal, milk, juice and a light
lunch that includes some pro-
tein (meat, fish, poultry, eggs,
c h e e s e

a strain on his
disease-fighting
immune system.

Megadoses of
vitamins, exces-
sive exercise
and a restrictive
diet can actually
depress the
immune system,
leaving a person
more suscepti-
ble to viruses
and bacteria.

With a little help, Steve can
help his immune system do its
job. -

For starters, he needs to
improve his diet.

Bagels and fruit are not sound
nourishment during the day,
and Steve is not getting all his
nutrients in his “baanced” din-

 

or dried
beans) will
provide his
i m m u n e
system with
the protein,
v i t a m i n s
and miner-
als it needs
to do its
job.

Modera-
tion is also
important. Steve is smart
to watch his fat intake, since a
high—fat diet can weaken his
immune system.

But eliminating fat from his
diet may harm him. Some fat in
the diet is desirable so Steve’s
body can absorb the fat-soluble
vitamins A, D, E and K. If he
included a little fat in his diet

every day, he would not
feel deprived and would not
binge.

Just as nutrient deficiencies
affect immune functioning, so
can nutrient excesses.

There is evidence that mega-
doses of certain vitamins
may harm the immune sys-
tem. Taking large amounts
of zinc and iron can decrease
the body’s ability to fend
off bacteria and viruses.
There’s no evidence that
vitamin C prevents or cures
the common cold, although
it may decrease a cold’s severi-
ty.
Steve would be better off get-
ting a steady supply of vitamins
and minerals on a daily basis
from a healthy diet. Eating a
variety of foods from all the
food groups is an excellent way
to do this.

What about exercise and the
immune system? Too much
exercise, especially for some-

dick,’ but that is shit-talking and
that is what I grew up with.”

“Rap is like a phone line,
black people talking to other
black people,” Ice-T said.
“White people pick up the
phone and are appalled and tell
us ‘you shouldn’t talk like that.’
People who have a problem
with it should just hang up the
 phone.”

He admitted that he was
wrong by criticizing homosexu-
als on his first rap tapes.

“I don't understand it, but I
don’t have a problem with it,”
Ice-T said.

“Just like some guys like fat
girls, I don’t understand that
either.”

Ice—T said that racism will
not end during his lifetime,
but students can bring a change
if they educate their children
in the future. He said the test
of whether a person is racist
is to ask them if they have
a problem with their daughter
or sister marrying another
race. If it bothered them,

according to Ice-T, they are
racist.

“Either you believe someone
is evil by the way they were
born or you don’t believe it,” he
said.

“I believe if you took [a child
from each race] and put them
in a sandbox, they would
be one hell of a family and pro-
tect each other  until some 
parent comes along and tells
them one is better than another
one.”

He emphasized the fact that

You say you want oz revolution...
It is time to start an intellectual revolution.

This call- to arms was issued last night by rapper Ice—,

T to the students of the University of Pittsburgh.
Throughout his talk he made many good points which
should be refined and expanded upon by students as
they develop their awareness through education.

He spoke about how racism is a learned behavior
and suggested that racism can be unlearned by focus-
ing on the fact that we are all members of the human
race. This idea can be a useful one for people to use
as they examine their own perceptions of the world. It
is time for people to shift their focus away from a nar-
row frame of reference onto the larger whole.

Although Ice-T was correct in saying that education is
the most grossly—underpaid profession in the United
States, his suggestion that teachers should be paid so

that they could be more glamorous was somewhat .

skewed. Students must be taught to ;value education
for benefits other than the simple matelrialbgenefits that
it can provide. Teachers should belpaid more, but
since this dream is not likely to happen, the value of a
sound education much be stressed at the earliest possi-
ble age.       ’ L  I

 "Students should act to create an initélleetual‘ revolu-
 Ice-T was correct in pointing out5Ig‘.tl1a-t the college
students of today are in the best positiogn to make the
changes necessary to elevate everyone; in _society. As
they move up in the world, tomorrow’s executives and
leaders should realize that they must help elevate oth-
ers along with them. 5*. -.

Achieving this goal, according to Ice-T, means “grab-
bijng. the money” without “becoming one of them.” Far
too often, however, when the majority begin to grab
the money they decide to keep it and look after their
own interest. In other words, they become “yuppies”
aslce-T characterized them.’ 

These ideas can provide all students with food for

thought. However, probably the most ‘important points
in Ice-T’s talk came when he spoke about thinking
itself. He said that people should get into discussions
and “mix it up” so that they would understand one
another better. As he pointed out, if someone agreed
with everything he said, then he was the only one
thinking.
V As he addressed the problems that the United States
faces today, his most helpful suggestion came as he
quoted another musician, Jello Biafra. He said “for
every problem, spend a whole day thinking about a
solution.” V -

Letter says abortion serious procedure

Although I avoid alignment with either the
pro-life or pro-choice sides of the abortion issue,
both of which tend to act rashly and react child-
ishly, I would like to contest some points made
in an editorial in Wednesday's The Pitt News.
This editorial expressed disapproval of the 1989
abortion law that requires that potential abortion
patients undergo counseling and a 24-hour wait-
ing period, and that minors have permission
from a parent or judge. The writer called these
measures “restrictive” and merely based on “the
morality of others.” Regardless of moral or ethi-
cal issues, I see these preliminary measures as
simply logical.

As far as counseling is concerned, abortion is a
serious medical procedure. It is the patient’s
right to be thoroughly counselled before any
procedure. Of course a potential abortion patient
should get a detailed explanation of what is
going to happen to her. If she is to make such a
profound choice, it should be a well-informed
choice. The subsequent 24-hour waiting period

makes sense as well. -Faced with new informa-
tion, a woman should not feel pressure to make
an immediate decision. Twenty-four hou_rs is a
short wait in the course of a pregnancy, and a
speck ‘against the backdrop of a lifetime. This
hardly seems a callous requirement.If hospitals
cannot treat minors without parental consent
except in emergencies and a minor needs
parental permission even to get her or his ears
pierced, it also makes sense that a girl needs
permission from a parent or judge to have an
abortion.Furthermore, the assertion that the law
“would mainly effect the poor and the young”
(Jacqueline Brinkley, New York: Times) smacks of
discrimination. Although I am not very familiar
with the demographics of abortion, I find it dis-
criminatory that people always assume that the
poor and/or the young have all the unwanted
pregnancies.Abortion is a dangerous, serious

procedure which should be treated the same

gravity as any other medical procedure.

Not all animation for young audiences

cartoons. Ms. Stiger is assuming
that any kind of animation is
only for children. This is
wrong: cartoons are NOT just
for kids. All the Warner
Brothers cartoons were intend-
ed primarily for adults.

Tom and Jerry didn’t start

Yeah, I know about the five
year old who burnt down her
house after watching “Beavis
and Butthead,” but these cases
are rare. There are forces
behind these disturbing times
that are bigger than any car-
toon you can imagine; to focus
on cartoons is to dodge the real

Brown and Mr. Rogers. They’re
still good after all these years.
The recent “Winnie the Pooh”
series was top-notch material.
But Mickey Mouse as he is
today is nothing more than a
Disney advertisement. Don’t
knock today’s cartoons until
you’ve seen them more deeply
than the explosions on their
surface; you might learn to
appreciate “Batman.” If you
want lighter fare, try “Garﬁeld”
or something. But don’t side-
step the issues!

Get off your soapbox now, we want to wash’

People seem to have a lot on their minds
these days, but it isn’t exactly what you might
think would concern them. It isn’t about keeping
their kids straight from.society’s “septic streets,”
it isn’t about keeping -a*sta'ble jobor when the
next windfall might arriveso that we can pay for
our hospital bills. No, it all seems to be about
each other, andevery prying, sickening detail
that manifests itself in our papers and television.
Very well then, if the life of the ‘90s individual
has festered into such communal doldrums that
spark must be piped in from the outside, then
administer it to yourself in the bathroom or clos-
et of your own private home  and don’t let
anyone know!

What really seems to push the whole thing
over the edge is the omnipresent opinion that
everyone seems all too eager to share with each

other. Thistis to say, at least when I was growing
up, if you shared something with someone, it
usually was attached to the notion that the per-
son wanted whatever it was that you had. Well
guess what folks, we don’t want what you have,
so “please ndon’t share. Tonya Harding,

Whitewater, abortion, gun-control — please

spare us the onslaught." Everyone seems to take
up the Platonic morality stance and preach
to the rest of us from atop soapboxes. If I
really needed preaching and words to guide
my dim, transparent existence, I’d pay for
the service. I think the saying “to each his own”
may have recently been revised to provide for:
“to all his own.” Why didn’t anyone inform me

of this? '

Last night at the USAir arena,
the Pitt Panthers played the
Hoyas of Georgetown well
enough to win, but due to
missed—foul shots Pittsuffered
its fifth defeat in the last six
games.

With three
seconds left
in the game
and the
Panthers
down 67-
64, guard
G a r r i c k

Thomas was sent to the line
after being fouled while
attempting a three—point shot.
Since Thomas was fouled
behind the three—point arch, the
6—foot—4—inch sophomore was
rewarded three foul
shots.

Thomas who made the first
free throw, missed the second
and intentionally missed the
third hoping that one of his
teammates could take it back up
for the winning shot.

But to the Panthers disap~
pointment, this was not so, as
the Hoyas narrowly escaped
with another victory against the
Panthers on their home
court.

Although Pitt missed several
free throws at the end of the
game, according to the
Panthers, their overall perfor—
mance from the line cost them
the game.

way live. You know I gotta send much love to my ace,
my main funkstain “Bobbito” Garcia for giving me
worldwide props. As a lot of you know, he let the
world know (via Vibe Magazine, the issue with Ice

Pittsburgh that had the funk on the radio (picture that!).
So now I’m fielding calls and props from everywhere,
but my ego won’t expand because I’m very modest.
Before we do this, I gotta send big ups to the Alphas for
letting me deejay the phattest party so far this year

Artist: KRS-One

Album: Return Of The Boom Bap

Producer(s): artist, DJ Premier, Kid Capri, Showbiz,
Norty Cotto

Label: Jive

rating: @@@@ 1/2

Circa 1986 - ‘87, this brother, along with his right
hand man, Scott La Rock, dropped classic after classic
on that ass. South Bronx. The Bridge Is Over.
Criminal Minded. Super Hoe. All of these songs plus
others make up the now classic (and much sought

after) Criminal Minded album. Now, some seven or
eight years later, minus Scott (who was killed in early-
’88), Lawrence Kris Parker, a.k.a. KRS-One, is taking
rap back to the “boom bap.”

Return of the Boom Bap takes us back to Kris’ ear-
lier days with hints and skills from the new. He shows
that he can bring a new style to rap every time he
opens his mouth. He comes extremely correct lyrically
on the album, but this time, he decided to call on a cou-
ple of friends of his to help him out with the music.
Very wise choice. On this mission, he recruited DJ
Premier, Kid Capri, Showbiz, newcomer Norty Cotto, as
well as taking up some of the slack himself. The beats
on this one are deﬁnitely on time. “KRS-One Attacks”
opens the album up marvelously with snippets, scratch-
es and samples of old BDP material and cut up (pre-
sumably) by DJ Premier. “Outta Here” is extremely
phat with a crazy jazz bassline and smooth drum track.
On that he tells the story of his life and reminded every-
one about his contributions to rap and hip hop.
Everybody knows about “Black Cop;” no need to talk
about it. “Sound Of Da Police” is about the plight of
black people and their run—ins with the cops. The
album’s title track is the phat joint because its basic as
hell. It’s all that. The most clever song on the album has
to be “I Can’t Wake Up.” Kris tells the story from the
perspective of a blunt. In it he names some of the
biggest names in hip hop (like Redman, Cypress Hill,
etc.). Basically, he talks about how the bigwigs smoke
him up. ‘

Overall the album was phat, but, if he would’ve left
“Stop Frontin’” and “Higher Level” off and replaced

them with “Hip Hop Vs. Rap,” the album would have
been rock solid.

Kelby 8: Larry, you’re both right; I should’ve put it in
the top—10 for ‘93. Kris is like the Energizer battery; he

Artist: Yaggfu Front
Album: Action Packed Adventure
Producer(s): artist, Minnesota, New Vibe Messengers
label: Mercury
rating: 1/2@

Noll It’s anything but an Action Pacleea’ Adventure,
it's weak as hell. I’m not gonna front. When I heard the
single version of “Slappin’ Suckas Silly” (beatwise),
they caught my attention. When I heard the second sin-
gle, “Busted Loop,” once again, the beat got me open;
but I did keep in mind that they had no lyrics. When I
opened the CD case, the disc was on life support.
When I put it in the CD player, it went ﬂatline.

This has to be the worst of ‘94 so far (until the new 2
Live Crew album drops). I gave them the half mark
because of the two tracks previously mentioned and
the track for “Fruitless-Moot.” Basically, they sample
the beat from “So Watcha Sayin”’ by EPMD and mess
it up with an extremely wack rhythm. But I can still
hear the beat, so it still slightly keeps my attention. The
rhyming is somewhat a combination of ‘89 De La
Soul/Tribe Called Quest, mixed with a touch of subtit-
ban roughneck and a rapid—fire delivery of lyrics that
are far—from—spectacular. From that combination, you
get some of the worst sh*t that has polluted human ears

After ‘Nova loss, Panthers get no rest as they travel to Storrs

By Ryan Btmcher

Asst. Sports Editor

Two weeks ago, the then
ninth-ranked Connecticut
women’s basketball team visited
Fitzgerald Field House, but it
was Pitt that showed up late.
After four minutes, the Lady
Panthers trailed 8-0 as the
Huskies pounded out an 80-63
victory.

Sunday at 1 p.m. Pitt will get
another shot at the now fourth-
ranked Huskies (21-2, 14-1 in
the Big East) at the Gampel
Pavilion in Storrs, Connecticut.

It will be different this time,
but that may or may not be a
good thing for the 17-6 Lady
Panthers.

‘‘We’ve got to come up with
something,” Pitt head coach
Kirk Bruce said.

“We may not come up with
anything. Just execute better.
Play better defense and box out
more. Stay close to them. We do
that, and we’ve got a shot to

Win.”

Pitt has lost two in a row,
both in the final seconds,
including a 67-65 overtime
defeat last night against
Villanova at Fitzgerald Field
House.

“Of course, we don’t have any
momentum,” Bruce said. “It
might be good that we’re off
tomorrow, to forget about
things. Maybe it is good to have
a day off‘ and regroup.”

Connecticut has continued to
grind up the competition. The
Huskies’ 86-65 win over Boston
College last night stretched their
winning streak to 12 games.
That includes a 76-65 win over
Seton Hall, the only Big East
team to defeat the Huskies this
season.

On the surface, the major dif-
ference is a negative for Pitt —
location. Instead of playing in
front of a few hundred relatively
quiet Pitt fans, this game will be
played in front of a Connecticut
crowd, which has been an aver-

age of 6,418 per game in Big
East contests. The Huskies are a
perfect 13-0 at Gampel Pavilion.

“It’s going to be loud,” Bruce
said. “The players have got to
do the job on the court. They
are going to have to communi-
cate well to each other, because
we can’t do as much from the
bench.”

The other major difference is
that both teams played on one
day’s rest last time. They will
each have an extra day this time
around. This could be an edge
to a Lady Panther squad that
must rely on quickness to beat a
much larger opponent.

Pitt has been vulnerable to
teams with strong inside games.
They are also close to the bot-
tom of the league in their

rebounding margin with a -3
average per game. UConn leads
the league by grabbing 11.3
more rebounds per game than
their opponents.

Connecticut’s offense
revolves around the low-post
skills of its massive inside play-
ers ——- 6-foot-4-inch center
Rebecca Lobo (averaging 19.1
points and 11 rebounds per
game), 6-7 rookie center Kara
Wolters (9.6 and 4.6) and for-
ward Jamelle Elliot (12.3 and
7.4).

Lobo has been living up to
her preseason conference
Player-of-the-Year press clip-
pings, leading the Big East in
rebounding, blocked shots (four
per game) and field goal per-
centage (546), as well as being

07

second in the league in scoring.

Last time around, not only did
Lobo, Elliot and Walters com-
bine for 51 points, they also
managed to take away Pitt’s
inside game. Lady Panther
Carolyn Miller was scoreless
and power forward jonna
Huemrich had to resort to
shooting from the outside for
her offense.

The one thing that nearly got
Pitt back into the game in the
second half was the three-point
shooting of rookie forward Erin
Miller, who knocked in four
bombs from beyond the arc.
She has fallen back into her role
as a bit player since then, but
her run showed that the three-
point shots might be there
