The University is threatening to make
members of the Kappa Sigma fratemity
ﬁnd a new place to live. _

According to Pitt, Kappa Sigma’s

North Oakland house violates a rule saying .

Pitt fratemities have to be housed on cam-
pus.

Kappa Sigma is based at 245 North
Dithridge St., outside Pitt’s campus bound-
aries. . A _
Because of the policy passed in-early
February, Pitt is threatening to suspend
Kappa SigIna’s ftmding if the fraternity
doesn’t move on—campus. ’ ' '

“Any student organization that wishes

to have a house to live in. or a facility to

hold meetings must belocated within cam— ‘

pus boundaries,” said Pitt spokesman Ken
Service. . ' ' .

A Kappa Sigma president Nick Moraites
said the fraternity was aware of the policy
when it moved into the house on Aug. 18.

“Our stance was that,. yes, we were _
violating their [University of Pittsburgh’s]

rule, but they do not have the right to make ,

that rule,” he said. V » . 1

Two «other fraternities on North‘
Dithridge Street, Pi Lamda Phi.and Delta
Sigma Phi, don’t have to move‘ because
they were in their houses before the new
rule was enacted. —  '

Joe Cavalla, Pitt’s student activities ’
director, said the University is “trying to

improve community relations” with resi—_
dents in the North Oakland area.
. “We are interested in moving all orga-
nizations on to campus,” he said. ’
Cavalla said nine fratemities were
moved to the hill near Sutherland Hall dur-

.ing "the 1980s, and that the University

would liketo see more of them move there
within the next few years. . ' .

“We feel they [the fraternities] are bet- '

ter on-campus than in the community,”
Cavalla said. » - p
Before moving into the house on

North Dithridge Street, the.-Kappa_Sigmar «

brotherslived in a house on Ward Streetin
South Oakland. The house was cockroach-
infested and, not .zoned as a ‘fraternity
house. '  "S -if ‘ '

‘ Moraites said he believes if the frater-
nity had moved onto a different street,

_ there would not be any problems.

The fiaternity’s current house is zoned
only as a fraternity house, and can’t be
used for any other purpose.

“Ifa family were to have. moved into it

« instead, the owner could be ﬁned for each

day they live there,” he said. The only use
for the building is as a fraternity house,

-since it is zoned as such, he added.

Moraites also said there are currently
11 other fraternity houses off-campus,
some of which are not zoned as fraternities.
He said that because of zoning, some of
these houses should not be allowed to exist

For The Pitt News

Cancer survivor Dani Grady says she’s
on a mission to prove that cancer survivors
are more than capable of leading full, pro-
ductive lives.

Grady has a message for everyone: “If
I can bike it, you can drive it,”

This message served as her slogan as

she led the ﬁrst Conquer Cancer Coast—to-

Coast National Bike Tour, which kicked off
July 20 near her home in San Diego and
will end Sept. 26, on the mall in
Washington, D.C.

The 70-day cross country event will
cover nearly 4,000 miles, in an effort to
raise awareness as well as funding for can-
cer research. _ -V

Ten years ago, at the age of 29, Grady

was diagnosed. with advanced breast can-
cer. She survived and has dedicated her life
to helping patients and survivors return to
living normal lives. ’

“Having breast cancer or cancer in
general is deﬁnitely character building,”
she said.

She stopped at the . University of
Pittsburgh "Cancer Institute (UPCI) last
week, one of her 25 stops at nationally rec-
ognized cancer centers.

Dr. John Kirkwood, 50, is a professor
of medicine and director of the UPCI’s
Melanoma Center, as well as an avid
cyclist. Kirkwood accompanied Grady and
a host of other riders through the Pittsburgh
leg of the tour, which stopped at UPMC

ACROSS THE COUNTRY

PITTSBURGH — Police are look-
ing for the person who dumped a
newborn baby on the side of the
Pennsylvania Turnpike. A highway
worker found the child, with her
umbilical cord still attached, crying,
bruised and naked on the hot asphalt
Monday afternoon, about ten miles
north of Pittsburgh. She is at
Children’s Hospital. Her condition
was upgraded yesterday to serious.

WASHINGTON House
Republicans are throwing cold water
on an idea to censure President
Clinton.

Minority leader Dick Armey says
GOP lawmakersbelieve it is “not an
option that holds a lot of attraction”
and a Republican on the House

Judiciary Committee told reporters

that a censure deal would “denigrate
the Constitution.”

Several House Republicans are
pressing for the possible release this
week of grand jury testimony in the

Monica Lewinsky case, which could

include President Clinton’s video-
taped testimony.

House Speaker Newt Gingrich

Committee has already been given.

the authority to move as rapidly as
possible on the release of the materi-
al that accompanied the Starr Report.

But some_ Democrats, like Zoe
Lofgren of California, are resisting
GOP efforts to speed up a process
she says should be “thoughtful and
deliberative.”

The White House wants to make
certain that the president’s grand jury

‘testimony isn’t “misused.”

BOULDER, Colo. _— Eight women
and four men are now at work trying

It has been 21 months since the
girl’s beaten and strangled body
turned up in the Ramsey’s Boulder
home. There has not been a single
arrest, which has led to widespread
criticism of the investigation.

A district attorney who has con-
sulted on the case says grand jurors

off—limits to prosecutors and police.

RICHMOND, Va. — The Virginia
Supreme Court is scheduled to ‘hear
an appeal today from lawyers for the
man on death row for the 1993 CIA
shootings.

Lawyers for.Mir Aimal Kasi plan
to argue that the jury pool was biased
because the trial was held in Fairfax
County, Va. They will also argue that
the Pakistani man’s confession to
government officials should have
been withheld from jurors.

Kasi was sentenced to death for
the shooting outside the CIA gates
that killed Frank Darling and

either. fraternity in the near future.” and women should be open about how far And those are only reported

Steve Partridge, a member of Delta
Sigma‘ Phi, also located on North
Dithridge Street, said he supports his
Kappa Sigma neighbors.

“The Greek system at Pitt should be a
separate entity,” he said. “The University
should not be able to restrict fraternities.
Whether or not the fraternity wants to be
recognized by the University should be up
to the fraternity, not the University.
Therefore, the fraternity should also make
the decision of where they want to live.”

Recognition by the University enti-
tles a Greek organization access to Pitt
ftmding, as well as participation in Rush
Week and other social events.

Kappa Sigma headquarters, located
in Virginia, wrote to Pitt saying that if the
University makes the ﬁaternity move, the
Inter—Fratemity Council would remove
the Kappa Sigma Chapter from student
activities at Pitt.

‘The University doesn’t want to lose
control,” Moraites said. ‘They know that
if we pull out of the organizations, they
won’t be able to monitor us. We can hold
par1:ies every day of the week and rush
whenever we want. There wouldn’t be
anything they could do about it.”

Cavalla said that the fraternity’s status,

Fraternity may have to move out of

they are willing to go sexually, they said.

“Unfortunately, you don’t sign a con-
tract saying ‘Hey —-— so can I take your
shirt off now?”’ said Alice Colombi,
another peer helper and speaker at the

BVBIIL

The three‘ women began the program
by asking the group to visualize a famil-
iar scene: Imagine standing in line at
Schenley Cafe and seeing someone cut in
line in front of them. The peer counselors
asked the audience how they would react
hr each situation if the person were a pro-
fessor, a complete stranger, or a guy they
were interested in.

Though the answers varied, one
common factor emerged:
Communicating feelings is harder when
relationships are stronger.

In other words, it is easier to tell a
complete stranger to back off than an
acquaintance or a close friend.

" Counselors said women are more
likely to be raped by acquaintances and
friends than by “someone off the street.”

“It’s not the stranger who jumps out
of the bushes,” said Colombi. “It’s usual-
ly the people you are with.”

About 60 female students attended
the gathering, coordinated by three
Holland Hall Resident Assistants.

The RAs got the idea during RA
training in" August, when Mary Koch
Ruiz, coordinator of Sexual Assault
Services, spoke to them about sexual
assault.

“As soon as she began speaking, we
said, ‘Wow. These are really important
things people should know,”’ said
Brandy Gorrnas, a Holland Hall RA.

The RAs have been planning the
event since then, plastering the walls of
Holland Hall with posters reading “Let’s
talk about sex.” They also offered ﬁee
condoms and food to those who came to
the event.

During the lighthearted discussion,
some students chuckled at the skits in
which the three peer counselors per-
formed. During one skit illustrating com-
munication problems, an audience mem-
ber participated by pretending she was a
man. She imitated a male voice, keeping
the audience laughing for minutes.

But the discussion was far from silly.

The three counselors painted a ﬂight-
ening picture of sexual assault, using sta-
tistics such as the fact that an average of

instances.

According to national statistics,
many of the already small number of
reported rapes or sexual assault cases
never go to court. Sexual Assault
Services deﬁnes sexual assault as any
unwanted sexual advance without pene-
tration.

These facts are evident at Pitt.
Among the 32 rapes or sexual assaults
that statistically happen each school year,
only 25 percent of the women who go to
Sexual Assault Services for assistance
actually go to the police. Out of that num-
ber, even fewer women go to court,

-according to Koch Ruiz.

For instance, only three rape cases in
the last six months have been brought to
public attention. These three include one
case last spring in which an underage
woman was given alcohol at a private
sorority mixer and was then allegedly
raped by her date.

Over 90 percent of date rapes and
sexual assaults involve the use of alcohol,
which explains why a large part of the
discussion focused on the relationship of
date rape to drinking. Counselors stressed
that women should be cautious, go to par-
ties and bars in groups, and follow their
intuitions.

“Your intuitions are always right,”
said Pucciarelli. “Always.”

The women also spent time on the
subject of date rape drugs, a problem that
has grown since the early ‘90s and is
something that happens at Pitt, according
to the peer counselors.

The two most common are Rohypnol
(a drug used in many countries to treat
insomnia) and Liquid—X. Both are color-
less, tasteless and odorless. Their effects,
aided by the use of alcohol, can last up to
eight hours. I

The counselors also said never to
leave a drink unattended or drink from a
large mix of beverages at a party. These
instances are when date rape drugs are
commonly used.

(Editor ’s Note: Sexual Assault Services
is currently accepting applications for
new peer counselors. Training sessions
begin Thursday, Sept. 24 and will be
held every Thursday throughout the
semester from 9 to 11 a.m. Those inter-
ested should contact Mary Koch Ruiz at
648-7856 or visit the oﬁce at 926 WPU.)

American schoolchildren need
Cl good sense of geography

The National Geographic
Society announced Monday
that it will donate a new lami-
nated 4-by-6-foot map of the

,world to ‘every classroom in

the country. Next month, these
double-sided maps will be dis-
tributed to Over 100,000
schools nationwide.

This thoughtful and gener-
ous gesture can help American
children who need to learn
where they are in this time of
global economies and interna-
tionalization. A huge map in
every classroom should help.

American students have
fared badly in areas such as
mathematics, science and
geography compared to stu-
dents from other countries. To
partake in a global economy,
America’s citizens must be up
to speed in these areas.

“What better way to start a
new millennium than to make
sure every one of our nation’s
schools is on the same map,”
said the society’s president,
John Fahey.

Both symbolically and
educationally‘, this donation
will do -a lot of good. The map
is a useful teaching tool. It’s
two-sided, with one, side fea-

‘ turing the politicalboundaries

of the world as of June 1998,

and the other featuring pho-
tographs of the world based
on images collected by satel-
lite.

According to the . society,
the creation and distribution
of the new maps (which cost
$1 million and took one year
to create), is part of its long-
term plan to help improve the
teaching of geography in
schools. _

Improvement in the geog-
raphy curriculum in elemen-
tary, middle and high schools
is definitely needed. This‘pri-
vate contribution is a step in

' the right direction.

Knowing where the 50

states are located and knowing .
on which end of the continent

South Africa is found should
be counted as common sense.
To not know where one is on
this planet is to be woefully
ignorant. To not know where
Canada is, is just plain dumb.
Schoolchildren need to
learn where they are in respect
to others. As well as learning
where countries are, they
should learn more about the
people who livegin them. ,
The National Geographic
Society has rightfully brought
a little piece of the worldinto
each American classroom.

— Pablo Neruda .

In a column last year, I recalled Ronald
Reagan’s 1984visit to Bitburg, Germany, during
which he -laid a wreath irrmemory of Hitler’s
Waﬁen S.S. and infamouslytdeclared that these
Nazi murderers were “victims too.” Reagan’s
apologists have sought ever since to distance the
“Gipper” from these philo-fascist statements,
claiming that they were not as bad as they seem,

that Reagan didn’t really mean it, ad nauseam. -
They overlook a subsequent event that has V

apparently disappeared down the memory hole:
The next leg on Reagan’s journey was Spain.
There, Reagan acknowledged that the Spanish
civil war had been the deﬁning event of the pre-
World War II era, so much so that sortie
Americans had even gone to Spain to
ﬁght. However, Reagan claimed
they fought on the wrong side.

A For those who need a refresher
course in history, let’s go over the rel-
evant details. In July of 1936, .
General Francisco Franco began a  revolt
against the democratically elected Popular Front
government of Spain. Franco’s ﬁrst soldiers
were mostly mercenaries from Morocco, and he
immediately gained support from the wealthy
landowners and industrialists of Spain.

In short order, he also procured the assis-
tance of fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. In all of
these measures, he was steadfastly supported by
the Roman Catholic Church. (To those for

‘ whom the Vatican’s recent “apology” about its

role in the Holocaust rang rather hollow: the

papacy proclaimed Franco’s fascist-sponsored.

revolt a crusade and that when Franco ﬁnally
succeeded in crushing Spanish democracy,

Eugenio Pacelli —— aka Pope’PiusgXlI —- called A

it a “yictory’ ’ over “atlieistic materialism”)

The world was given its ﬁrst glimpse of the
horrors of the blitz to come, as German and
Italian bombs rained down on Guernica and
other Spanish towns. The response of the “liber-

«- al democracies” of France, Britain and the

United States was a “neutrality” that allowed

their “brother” republic to be drowned in blood .

by the fascists. The only nations that sided with
the embattled Spanish Republic were Mexico
and the USSR, and their material support was
woefully inadequate for the purposes of counter-

ing the guns and bombs of the Axis.
The Republic could rely only on the
strength of its poor and working people, and on

‘ the goodwill of ordinary people the world over.

Many -raised money for ambulances and other
needed supplies for Spain. Still others —- rough-
ly 40,000 worldwide — became volunteers in
the International Brigades to -ﬁght against fas-
cism alongside the Spanish people. While they-
were unable -to tum the tide against Franco, the
Internationals did manage to stave off the fascist
encirclement of Madrid at the famous battle of
the Jarama River in February of 1937. _

Among the Internationals were some
3,000 citizens front the United States, the bulk of
whom were part of a ﬁghting unit referred to as
the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. They were the
ﬁrst integrated military unit in the history of the
United States and the ﬁrst to be commanded by

anAfrican-American: the legendary Oliver Law, '

who lost his life on the battleﬁelds of
‘Spain. Most of those who survived
later fought in the U.S. Army in
World War II. '

C After that war, though, the

Brigade veterans was repaid by their being
labeled “premature anti-fascists” by the U.S.
government. Many lost their jobs, were black-
listed or were hounded by the FBI for being
members or sympathizers of the Communist
Party. Pitt students would do especially well to
remember one of these remarkable men: Robert
Colodny. Colodny was wounded in the head in
Spain, but survived to serve with distinction in
World War II. He was blacklisted from the uni-
versity system for six years after refusing to sign
a loyalty oath at the University of California in
1950, although he later taught at the University
of Pittsburgh for 26 years. He died in 1997.

It seems redundant for me to point out
that just one of these men is worth a million
Ronald Reagans. What, then, do we have to
learn from the vile example of those who lionize

Reagan, yet know nothing of the Lincoln ‘

Brigade veterans whose courage ‘and commit-
ment Reagan spat upon? Only a fact that should
be self-evident: that the rich and powerful have
been and always will be contemptuous of
democracy. Remember that when they set out to
bomb the next Guemica.

John Lacny has resolved that next time they shall
not pass.

Nature. As far I’m concerned, this is the
ﬁnal frontier. With this in mind, I’m oﬂ’ on
my ﬁrst camping trip with a small but like-
able group of ﬁiends. '

Some may say that large bodies of water
are “great unexplored mysteries.” Jacques
Cousteau periodically commented on the
“vonders of ze zea.” However, the larger
bodies of water are easily crossed by air-
plane. One could say that the’ great forests
are, too.

True, but at least if the plane crashed in
the sea, you could sit in a life raft and listen
to others whine while waiting for search per-
sonnel. If the plane crashed in the middle of
the forest, you would have to “hack it.”
Some peppy former Eagle Scout would lead
the survivors on a fun little trek to “civiliza-
tion.” You’d end up eating other members of
your group and whatever you could kill —
grubs, locusts, weasels and the like.

Hacking it in the forest, though, is more
glamorous than sitting on a lifeboat and
wondering what keeps bumping the boat
ﬁorn underneath _

Mycampingtripwilllastonlythree
days, but it should provide memories and.
stories lasting at least one or two weeks.

My group of ﬁiends Went camping for a
week after high school and claimed to have
had “fun.” They brought back pictures that
backed up. their “frm” claim to a certain
degree. ' _

Some of the pictures were really pretty:
sunsets, and squirrels that came to nibble on
my ﬁiend near the campsite. Others were a

‘their dead. The

bit more morose. I didn’t need to see my
ﬁiends bathing or the howling man with the
piece of windshield stuck in his forehead

after swerving and crashing to avoid what he '
thought was a rabbit (which turned out to be

a dead kitty). So upon invitation, I was a bit,
well, apprehensive.

Most gruesome and unspeakable acts
seem to occur in the woods, according to the
movies. Aside ﬁom the ﬁm provided by co-
ed “camps,” there are the secret clearings
where mob mem-
bers go to bury

largest concern,
of course, comes
with being bitten
by something. It
doesn’t even have
to be something
poisonous. I can
just see some
colossal mutant
dragonﬂy landing
and taking a huge
bite of my dry
skin. Over the —
next few hours, the spot will swell up and
house puss, blood and other bodily ﬂuids.
VV1th my luck, it’ll embed its young in my
ﬂesh. I can see the visit to the doctor’s oﬂice:

Me: What do you suppose I should do
about this?

, Dr.: Well, no problem, we’ll just suck
out the juice with a needle. Like this large
one over here (takes out a needle the size of
an ice pick).

Me: Um...(tlren contact) DAMN!
Dr.: Well, oh dear. =

 

Me: Are those things supposed to be
crawling out?

Dr.: Oh dear  ,
V The other fear, which isn’t so big, is
being chased by animals thatare larger and
more ferocious -than my ﬁiends. Climbing

up trees was never really my thing. To get »

things thatwere stuckinatree, Iresortedto
throwing objects at the aforementioned stuck
object. This usually resulted in success or in
spending most of the afternoon ,try‘ing to

 

retrieve an ever-increasing? number of tree
ornaments.

VV1th my luck, I’d be chased by a bear,
startrunningfromit, andthenseetwotrees
close together that I think I could get
through..The idea here of course is for me
not to get stuck, but for the bear to get stuck.
(For you animal lovers, I wouldn’t just leave
the bear there. After taunting it for a while.
and rubbing it in .that I’m the brighter
species, I’d let someone know about it so
they could deal with it.)

CATHLEEN O’MAruzY/ STAFF ILLUSTRATOR

But in reality, of course, I would get

stuck in the trees and have to go through the"

pain of only being able to crawl out after the
bear had ﬁnished eating half of my
appendages.

Being an insecure individual, I also
have this innate fear of being abandoned.
After setting up “camp” and eating dinner
(macaroni and cheese, from what I hear)
we’ll tell some silly ghost stories and be off
to bed in our comfortable yet oddly restric-
tive sleeping bags.
I’ll wake up the
next morning and
my “friends” will
have left. No food
or gear will be in
sight. A sleeping
bag will be all I

    

if I’m lucky, they’ll
leave my shoes.
Virrthout any gear,
and with an odd
obligation .to hold
on to the sleeping
bag, I’ll be forced
to set oﬁ alone. VV1th my luck it’ll start rain-
ing soon after that. .

Tony I

Oliva .

I was doing a lot of thinking, this week-
end, but probably not about what you might
be expecting; No, I did not have my nose
buried in the seamy underbelly of the Starr
report. Itdoes appearthatIamintheminor-
ity. I guess that’s nothing new.

When the legendary “trial of the centu-
ry” was rammed down our throats on tele-
vision, I went outside and enjoyed my after-
noons. Nor did I stand by late at night to get
all the late-breaking news about JonBenet
Ramsey. True, I was curious bout the ver-
dict of the O.J. Simpson case, and I was
hopeful that JonBenet’s killer would be
found, but I did not schedule my life around
what little tidbits’ of information I could
sink my teeth into. But it appears America
came to a standstill much like it is doing
now. I ﬁnd that sad. ‘

, Doesn’t the American public have bet-

~ ter things to do than read some trash about

an Arkansas pervert? Or spend every after-
noon for a year glued to the TV, piecing
together their own murder theories? Can’t

the people of this land let a family in
Colorado grieve in digniﬁed privacy
instead of tuning in to “Hard Copy” to “get
to the bottom of things?” It is asad state of
affairs when people cannot get through
their own lives without feeding on the mis-
ery and scandalous acts of others.

I am not saying that we shouldn’t be
interested in knowing ﬂrat the leader of the
ﬁee world lied on countless occasions to

-the courts and the American people, but

isn’t that all we need to know? Why the
need to ﬁnd out all the sordid details of his
relationship with his interns? “Bill Clinton
lied; O.J. was acquitted; JonBenet’s killer
has yet to be arrested; what else do we need
to know?

I don’t blame the media, but the
media’s job, unfortunately, is not only to
report the news anymore. The media is now
in the business of making money. They will
report and harp on whatever will sell. Why
does it sell? Because it’s a seller’s market,
and society is buying.

We have come to a fork in the road -

Look at what we have wrought. Talk shows
that prattle on and on about how bad life is

and how tough it is. Don’t we have our own
lives to live? Ifour lives are rough, we don’t

' need talk shows to tell us because we
already know. We also have “investigative '

news shows,” such as “Hard Copy,” which
invade people’s privacy, get all the inside
dirt on them, and sometimes destroy the
people they are supposedly trying to help. If
you go to the local Giant Eagle, go to the
checkout, and you will be barraged by
tabloid after tabloid of asinine reports and

A “joumalism” that borders on slander and

libel.

Before you tune in to the next special
on JonB enet or the Clinton ﬁasco, ask your-
self, “Would I want to be in that person’s
situation if I didn’t have to be?’,’ If you’re
honest with yourself, the answer will be no.
Remember that the next time you want the
inside story of a person’s or farnily’s private"
life. How would you like it? The only one

to blame is yourself. You feed the machine. »

‘ If you want something steamy to read,

 “The Scarlet Letter.” If you want to

solve crimes, become a detective. Don’t be
a person on your couch stuﬂing down pork
rinds on a beautiful aftemoon because

machines

you’re too busy invading somwne else’s
privacy. Is that what this society has
become after 220-some odd years of exis-
tence? A country that doesn’t value privacy,
or does, but only if it’s a boring privacy that
doesn’t interest anyone? ‘

Clinton gave the presidency a big
black eye with the way he has handled him-
self in oﬂice, and I hope he has enough dig-
nity left to resign before he drags the coun-
try ﬂrrough the mud. But I also believe that

the American society todayshould hang its ,3‘
' head even lower.

We have become a country that feeds
oif of gossip and rumors. I was naive
enough tothink that the death of Princess

Diana actually» taught us all something A

about hounding a person and destroying her
privacy. I guess _I was wrong. It wouldn’t be
the ﬁrst time, but I’m just sorry that I am
wrong this time. ,

I said before that I was doing a lot of
thinking over the weekend; it appears most
people had their thinking done for them.

Staff writer

1 “Dumb jock,” “muscle-head”
and “freeloader” are just some of
the many stereotypes applied to col-
legiate football players by the unin-
formed critic. But thanks to student-
like Pitt’s Andrew
Grischow, you can throw those sar-
casms into the trash with Johnny
Majors’ playbook.

Grischow, a fifth-year senior A

center, played under Majors and
finally broke into the starting lineup
midway through the 1996 season.
With the installation of Walt Harris
and his coaching staff, Grischow
was given a chance to shine last sea-
son, and he is expected to do even
more this season.

One improvement Grischow
made for this season was gaining
weight. With the addition of 25
pounds over the summer, he now
stands 6-foot-3-inches tall and
weighs 280 pounds. “Eating is one
of the most important things I do

V right. now. It’s a major part of my‘
day,” Grischow said‘.

He’s not lying. A typical day for
Grischow looks like this: Wake-up,
eat breakfast, watch films, lift
weights, go to class, eat, watch

 

N Eiuc Wnro Eonon

Grischow and the Pitt offensive line
will be tested against Penn State.

more films, eat some more, practice,
eat, attend meetings, eat, and sleep.

Yes, he does manage to fit class-
es into his schedule and does more
than just attend them — he excels in
them. Grischow is a two-time All-

- Big-East Academic Team honoree,

was a 1997-1998 Bell Scholar

Athlete, and has been a recurrent
Athletics Director’s Honor Roll stu-
dent._ “My parents have made me
understand my whole life that acad-
emics are the most important thing
to them, and my focus my four years
here has been on school work,“ says
Grischow.

' His football ‘resume is not bad,
either. Being a center is not as easy
as it may seem, although Grischow
loves to downplay —his importance.
“The only difficulty is understand-
ing defenses, reading defenses,
knowing when linebackers are
going to blitz, and then making the
calls,” says Grischow.

Simple enough, right? Offensive

line coach Tom Freeman thinks

more highly of Grischow’s role on
the team.

“He’s got line calls. He’s got to

announce down and distance. He’s
got to announce defensive personnel
in the game. He’s got to be on top of
everything that goes on, plus direct
all the traffic at the line of scrim-
mage. That’s a big job,” says
Freeman. '
Grischow is the offensive line’s
most experienced returning player,
and sophomore guard Ethan Weidle

Bonfire planned to boost excitement for game

Tom camlllo

Staff writer

As Grandpa used to say, noth-
ing cooks a nittany lion like a good
ol’ bonfire. Well, a nittany lion
won't be sizzled‘, but there will be
another bonfire Thursday on the
Cathedral lawn.

The event.will take place at 7
p.m., kicking off the festivities in
preparation for the Pitt-Penn State
football game on Saturday. This
will be the second v- annual bonfire,
an event designed to rouse school
spirit and let the team know it has
support for the game.

, Last year’s bonfire took place
before the Notre Dame game and
was spearheaded by the Blue and
Gold Society. This year, the
Student Government Board and the
Pitt Program Council will take the

reigns, with help and contributions,

from various groups, including the
Blue and Gold Society.

According to SGB President
Alyson Wallach, “The Blue and

Gold Society is honored that SGB
and PPC are" taking over and mak-
ing the bonfire an annual event.”
The bonfire is also receiving
recognition around the city, thanks
in part to radio station 105.9 FM,
“The X.” ' _
“They will have phone check-
ins back to the studio informing the

disc jockeys of what’s going on,” i

said Tom Misuraca, the assistant
director of student activities.

Participating in the" festivities
will be the Pitt dance team, cheer-
leaders and band. A stage will be
set up where all of the fall athletic
teams will be present, along with
head football coach Walt Harris
and Chancellor Mark Nordenberg.

“Coach Harris is supposed to
speak,  and he’ll probably call
upon a few players to speak as
well, and Chancellor Nordenberg
will actually light the torch for the
bonfire,” said Misuraca.

A giant video screen will show
highlights of this football season

and last, including,Pitt’s dramatic
wins over Miami and West
Virginia.

Student attendance and partici-
pation are the keys, though. “A
giant banner was purchased say-
ing, ‘We Believe,’ and students
who attend will have the chance to
sign this banner, which will be
placed along the wall of the student
section at the stadium, where it
will stay for the remainder of the.
year,” said Wallach.

In addition to free Pepsi prod-
ucts
Services, snacks and glow neck-
laces will be sold, and 2,000 Pitt T-
shirts will be given away on a first
come-first serve basis.

The bonfire itself will be lit at
dusk, with festivities scheduled to
continue as the bonfire burns.

“This is great for the students. 9

It’s a great time to be here. Let’s
see if we can instill some school

spirit and help the team out,” said

Misuraca.

Aside from being babies, punks, whiners, spoiled
brats and losers, Penn State people are disturbingly
obsessed with Joe Patemo.

I guess I can understand those people being
Patemo fans; after all, the guy has led the team to 300
cheap wins. But being a

fan is one thing; being
disturbingly obsessed is
another.

These people don’t
seem to realize that
Patemo is not exactly
attractive. But still, they
wear T-shirts with his pic-
ture on it, and my
favorites are the life-sized
JoePa cardboard cutouts
they stick in their homes.

I am the biggest Pitt
fan on earth; I bleed blue
and gold. I have a Pitt ﬂag
and lots of other Pitt para-
phernalia hanging on my
walls.

And I really think
Walt Harris is the best
thing that could have hap-
pened to Pitt football. But
I’d much rather have a
banner with a cool logo

life—sized cutouts of a 72-year-old man. »
No one in Happy Valley seems to think anything

it, though. Can you imagine people paying homage to

other senior citizens the way they do to J oePa?
Picture Thanksgiving dinner at your house. With

the warm smell of turkey and mashed potatoes ﬁlling

 
  

on it in my yard than a life-sized cutout of Harris (no the air, your whole family gathers around the dinner

offense, Walt).
Just think about how weird that really is. These
aren’t action photos of players or catchy emblems, but

table.

The icomucopia sits in the center of the table, the

fancy wine glasses at each setting, and the life-sized

cardboard cutout of your old, drunken uncle Louie is
propped against the wall behind the table.

He is clenching his bottle of Jack Daniels with his
grimy hands, and his wide, confused grin reveals both
of his yellow teeth.

Doesn’t quite ﬁt, does it?

Well, it’s the same
thing with Patemo. Take a
drive around State College,
especially on game day,
and you’ll see a whole
bunchof those cutouts of
the geezer. _

More than anything,
they show just how pathet-
ic Penn Staters are.

What’s next?
Posters of JoePa in a thong
bikini?

 How about a break-
fast cereal: Joe Patem-O’s?

Or‘ maybe they
could have JoePa cologne
and bottle the musty scent
of his rotting carcass.

I have nothing
against old people; I love
jolly old men and huggable
grandmas. But Patemo is
nothin but a miserable,

pompous old man. ’

Pitt-Penn State merchandise hot

Fred Schrayber
For The Pltt News

For Dennis Corvella and Chas
Bonasorte, there is nothing more exciting
than an excited Pitt fan. After all, when that
school spirit grabs us, these men get hand-
somely ‘rewarded.

It’s the business of marketing the pride
of die University of Pittsburgh. And what a
business it is! Especially this weekend.

Bonasorte, owner of the Pitt Stop on the
comer of Bigelow and Forbes, is so sociable
one would have trouble holding a conversa-
tion with him. Between a sentence, he may
wind up selling a couple T—shirts.

From the way Bonasorte talks about his
business, he seems to enjoy every day of his
job. °

“Last year was the year of ﬂue new
Panther logo,” he said. “There can’t be a
comparison, but I am expecting a good
year-”

Bonasorte gives credit to the increased
number of freshmen, as well as the enthusi-
asmthatisﬁllingtheair. Heoperatesoneof
only two stores in Pittsburgh dedicated to
marketing the University’s merchandise.

a He sells everything from key chains to
teddybearstosweatshirtsanditseemsas
though nothing goes to waste. ’

The other Pitt merchandise outlet, the
Pitt Shop, is run by Corvella and has a more
relaxed atmosphere.

' . Neither man said he competes with the
other, although each stressed his own busi-

ness’ merits.

“We don’t compete, but my prices are
25 percent lower,” said Bonasorte.

Corvella said, “I don’t compete simply
because I am on a dilferent level of busi-
ness.” V
There is a deﬁnite difference in their dis-
positions, but Bonasorte and Corvella say
they do not have a rivalry. There isn’t a need
for one because of how good business is for
both

The Pitt football team’s home season
opener was a thrilling win. The men’s soccer
team has gone undefeated in its ﬁrst ﬁve
games of the season, battling to a 2-2 tie at
Notre Dame on Sunday.

There is nothing to frown about.
Furthermore, the new Panther logo only puts
the cherry on this big and splendid stmdae.

W_hat contributes to hope for a great

year? The near-monopolistic number of

stores selling the merchandise? The number
of excited ﬁeshmen? Most likely, it’s all of
the above, plus the newfound Pitt Pride.
Nonetheless, no matter what students
wish to buy with a panther on it, it’s all right
there glimmering in front of them. No mat-
ter what your preference — a high—hat store
or an on-the-rim stop — it’s all within walk-
ing distance in Oakland, and all students
need to do  call home for more money.

After all, the deep-pocketed parents that
these salesmen love so dearly aren’t the only

ones who want the Pitt Panther somewhere
in their wardrobes.

Gmscnow  

I who played tackle last year,Iis the

only other returning starter on‘ the
offensive‘ line. The team lost ‘three

- powerful linemen_,in Tony Orlandini,

Jon Marzoch and Reggie Thomas,
and that prompted Freeman -totsay,
“Andrew’s leadership is imperative.
He’s played "a lot. of games.
Everything is on his shoulders, and
he has to be the guy in there.”

It is also a role that Freeman
feels he can handle.

‘ “He’s a sharp guy who picks
things upgquickly. He’s also gotten
bigger and has learned to play with
hispads down, which-allows him to
take advantage of his quickness and
agility,” says Freeman. '

Grischow explained, “Once
you’ve worked with the offense so
much, especially against Coach
[Larry] Coyer’s difficult defense,
you’re already prepared for all the
stuff you’re going to see. Sometimes
there’s a lot of pressure on you to
make the call quick and get up on
the snap count,’ but it’s getting easi-
er as I get older and know the sys-
tem.” ’ _ . I
Oh yeah, there’s hitting that goes
on in this game as well, Grischow
doesn’t.shy away from that, either.

 

FROM ‘PAGE 10

“I like to run—block‘ because I

like to hit linebackers. I want to feel’

the hit,” says Grischow. “I’m pretty
aggressive when I pass-block, too.
Once I setup, I find some guy and
try to put him on the ground as fast
as I can. I like it when they hit the
ground.”

When asked if he would like to
do that to any Penn State players,
Grischow said,,“An opponent ‘is an
opponent.” But with a sly look, he
also added, “I, ‘personally, would
like to do some good stuff against
Penn State.”

But don’t’ expect Grischow to

.put personal goals ahead of team

goals. “I just want us to win as many
games as we possibly can_. All I want
us to do as a team is to play hard. I

want people to -be knocking the

opponent down, and I want to see
opposing defenders begging to get

_ off the field. The remaining mem-

bers from last year understand what
it takes to win and how to get there.
I think we all understand that.” said
Grischow.

This desire is what Freeman
thinks is most unique about
Grischow, and the coaches hope it
will lead_ him to further‘ success.
