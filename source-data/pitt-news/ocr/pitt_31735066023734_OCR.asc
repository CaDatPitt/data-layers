State to Pitt: ‘Tou

By SETH LUBOVE
’Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt Chancellor Wesley W. Pos-
var, said Tuesday that tuition “again
will have to rise" as a result ofan en
adequate increase-in state appropri-
ations. Posvar attributed the low
funding increase to‘ state—related
institutions as contained in Gov.
Dick Thornburgh’s budget to “infla-
tion that is creating the problems for

the nation. the state and the
university.”
The governor; in his annual

budget presented to the General
Assembly Tuesday asked for $74.6
million for Pitt. an increase of$3.48
million over last year’s appropria-
tion. That‘s approximately 4.9
percent.

Pitt had asked for $83,994,700 in
state appropriations for fiscal year
1982,‘ an increase of«~$l2,925,700
over Pitt‘s FY I981 appropriation of
$7l.l million or l8.2 percent.

“We have to recognize that the
realculprit is inflation," Posvar said,
while not releasing any specifics
about the tuition hike. “And were
not going to get out of this squeeze
of cutting programs and raisingtui-
tion until the whole country solves
the problem ofescalating inflation."

Posvar described tuition increases
as being “practically universal” all
over the country this year, adding
that a “major new compensating fac-
tor”, is the increase in federal stu-
dent aid in the past two years, which

The abortioniissues is still a part
of the political arena despite the
I973 Supreme Court ruling ‘ that
made it legal. The battle is now cen-

-1-tered-—-on-the-Human Life Amend-

ment (HLA). which is currently
being debated in the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee. .

amendments under consideration,

N.C.) and Rep. Robert Dornan (D-

“The paramount right to life is
vested in each human being from the
moment of fertilizatidn without

According to Mary Robinson of

Chancellor Wesley Posvar

has added $10 million in aid to Pitt
students annually. ‘

Pitt’s total tuition income this
year is $66 million according to Pos-
var, of which approximately $40
million comes from a variety of stu-

regard to women‘s rights. birthcon- .

trol, religion and civil liberties.

“The HLA establishes fetal per-
sonhood," Robinson said. “it would
mean that a woman's body is not
something she could control as soon
as she got pregnant, because every-
thing would have to be_ geared
towards preserving the. life of the
fetus.” P

Robinson added that,’ in the

absence ofthe Equal Rights Amend-
ment, a fetus would have more rights

than a grown-woman.--~  -----  -

“You absolutely cannot protect
the fetus without enslaving the

— woman who is carrying it,” Robin-

son said.

' Because. the fetus’ would be
declared a human being at the
momentof conception, Robinson
said, the HLA could also outlaw the
intrauterine device (IUD) and at
least one form of the birth control
pill. _

“There's a certain_ amount of
uncertainty asto how these forms of
contraceptives work.” Robinson
said. “But it’s generally thought that
they prevent the implantation ofthe
fertilized egg."

“Abortion is not something grand
andglorious that one looks for in
their life; adoption is not a cure-all
and contraceptives are not perfect,
so until alternatives can be found,
the option of abortion has to be kept
open,” Robinson said.

However, Posvar cautioned that
the medical school will have‘to“look
to new sources of revenue“ and to
“make a major effort to search for
new sources of funds from outside
the university."

Thornburgh cited an “oversupply
of doctors and an undersupply of
doctors in crucial areas where they
are needed," as his motivation for
the small increases in state medical
education funding.

state-related universities will present
arguments for additional funding to

By WENDY WAREHAM

Of the many barriers that prevent
disabled people from participating

‘fully in our society, the two most
‘I often mentioned are environmental

barriers and attitudinal barriers.
These types of barriers are present in
all areas ofsociety, including college
campuses.

The challenges of completing a
college degree are not easily sur-
mountable for any student. But fora
disabled student, the difficulties are
increased by a lack of awareness of
the needs of the disabled.

Debbie Geier, a former Pitt stu-
dent, and Brenda Lockrey, a Pitt
political science major discussed
some of the past and present con-
cerns and issues affecting disabled
students.

Debbie has been disabled since
birth from muscular dystrophy. She
is currently employed by the federal
government and is working with
personnel management.

Brenda became blind following an
accident when she was six years old.
She is a political science and philo-
sophy major here. What do you
think is the biggest problem disabled
students must deal with’? _

Debbie: Probably mobility, the
fact that the campus was so spread
out. I was in a masters program for

I rehabilitation counseling. Our

courses were limited to two or three
buildings, so I was fortunate. But

‘ they were spread out among West-

ern Psych and another nearby build-
ing and David Lawrence. They
didn't have the van with the hydrau-

’ lic lift then, the magic carpet service.

So they had to do it all on foot. They
had some curb cuts. But not all of
the ones they have now. You could
get from one place to anotherbut it
was really’bad in the winter. You’d
slidedown over the hills and people
would have to help you up over the
curbs.

Brenda: I think it would be an
attitudinal barrier. It‘sjust that most
people here aren’t acquainted with

disabled people, I don‘t think. It.

takes a while to break through and
to get to know people and to get
involved with things people are
doing.

‘ Q: What kinds of myths are con-

nected with your disabilities‘?

Debbie:- I don‘t know if it‘s a myth
or not. Typically people will ask my
husband at a restaurant, ‘What
would she like to eat?‘ They don‘t
address me directly. Some people
say disabled people are" better
workers. or worse workers. I think
that‘s wrong. People areindividuals.
You can‘t make generalizations
about a group like that.

1981

This is the symbol for the 1981 U.S. Council for
thelnternational Year of Disabled Persons.

Brenda: Some people think we have
better hearing. I don't think we‘ll
ever get rid of the mythology about
fantastic hearing and things
like,‘lsn’t it fantastic what they can
teach them.’ Some people think I‘m
more discerning of people’s charac-
ters. ‘You met this person. What do
you think of them? Come on, you
should be able to tell something
more that I can,'type ofthing. I may
be more aware of inﬂection (in voi-
ces) than a lot of sighted people. But
on the other hand," I think I can
probably draw the same true or false
conclusions from voices as they can
from facial expressions. I don’t
think it’s anything more or les than a
different awareness of how people

I present themselves. I think it has

nothing to do with whether or not a
person can see. But I think I should
say I know people who would dis-
agree with that. .
Q: Are there people who would
prefer to perpetuate those myths?

Brenda: Yes definitely. I'm not a
psychologist or anything, but I think
its people who are more uncomfor-
table with the fact thatithey‘re blind.
I think it‘s a way of getting around
that fact and drawing attention to
themselves in a way that is more
simple.

Q: Did you attend a special school‘?

Brenda: I went directly into the
school for the blind program. It‘s a
standard school program, first grade
to twelfth. We started with mobility
training on the streets, I think, about
third grade.

Debbie: I donft think many dis-
abled students should be sent to spe-
cial schools. I went to a special
school. I think every effort should be

made to mainstream those students. .

Q: When should people offer help?‘
Brenda: It depends on the way you
want to help. If somebody asks ifl
want help crossing the street. even
though most of the time I‘m per-
fectly capable and I know where I‘m

.2

at, I never say no. Just because
sometimes, especially if you're in a
new place, you could be lost. And I
think that if people keepion saying
‘no, especially‘ if they‘re not real nice
about it, people would get more
araid to ask. or offer help.

Q: What do you expect to find in
the job market?

Brenda: Well, I switched my major
from music. I’m political science
now. I think-there’s a little morejob
potential there. I may go on to law
school. So that‘s a possibility now.
I'm just looking for a summer job
now. I haven’t worked yet.

Debbie: If you want to compare "it
(job market) to prior to I973, before
the rehab act,vyou now have an
‘excellent chance of employment. If
you want to compare it to the gen-
eral sector, we're all in the same
boat. I think the disabled person has
to take their qualifications, and

present it to the employer and be
aggressive and honest.

Q: What do you hope the Interna-
tional Year will accompish?

Debbie: I think probably I would
like to see employersand people and
in general treat disabled people
equally when you evaluate their
qualifications and contributions and

' to compare it to other people who’

have the same degree. People should
be equal and given a fair chance, not
cut out right at the beginning
because they’re disabled.

Brenda: I think-the Year could be
very beneficial if it's not carried too
far. If it's handled right I think it
could be very beneficial. When Iwas
in high school, awareness was my
big thing. I thought as I‘ got higher
and higher up in the heirarchy I
would have more ofa chance to edu-

cate people. I think ifiwe could get.

more people involved in things like
that. not necessarily only disabled
people. it could be a very good thing.’

Conference

A Success [

The fifth annual’ tuition hike news conference went off
without a hitch. There were no suprises as Wes Posvar
announced that Dick Thornbourgh's 4.9% increase in state
appropriations would mean higher prices for students next
fall.

Wes was careful not to offend anyone, thanking--the
Governor for his alms, expressing concern for the affected

low-income families. and placing the blame squa'rely on that '

vicious fifth horseman of the apocalypse,-the ravanger.
inﬂation.

“The real culprit is inflation itself," Wes said. “We shall
break out of the pattern of repeated tuition increases and
program austerity only when national inﬂation is brought
under control.” ‘

That translates into something like “don’t hold your
breath."

One thing about these annual news conferences. they give
us something to think about when the heat goes off in our
garrets.

“l wonder how l’m going to pay for all of this?”

“I wonder if Wes is going to get to keep his chauffeur and
Limo?” C

Despite financial constraints, through careful reallocation
of funds we recently developed programs responsive to new
or changing student needs.” Wes said. “These include busi-
ness. information science, computer science, nursing anes-
thesia. statistics, legal studies. and mining engineering."

With programs like that we can change C.A.S. to C.S..
and save thousands in computer ink.

After five years you might think that we could. come up
with more creative “culprits” than inﬂation: excessive fed-
eral defense spending, or the reactionary attitude of state
legislators towards the financingof higher education per-
haps? Not a chance.

Inﬂation has become the eternal enemy, the easy to attack
foe,. lt eliminates culpability, and deﬂects the critics.
“What can we do? its that damn inflation.”

The annual tuition hike news conference promises to
become a tradition at Pitt. maybe they’ll be serving hors

Pitt Faculty Can   Be Factor in Reversing Trends 

The l970‘s were a difficult period
for funding at the University of
Pittsburgh. Year after year. efforts
to secure adequate funding in Har-
risburg have resulted in disappoint-
ment. ln little slices or big chunks.
the l970‘s brought a steady reduc-
tion, after inﬂation, in Pitt‘s yearly

- appropriation and faculty and stu-

dents had to bear a larger share of
the university‘s financial burden. in
the form of lower real salaries and
higher tuition.

lfthe status quojat Pitt persists.
the l980’s look to be an even

. grimmer decade for faculty and stu-

dents. Public budget slashing is in
the air. Pennsylvania currently
ranks 45th among states in per cap-

" ital contribution to higher education.

Even worse, over the past two years
it was dead last. 50th. in its rate of
increase (actually a I0 percent
decrease. in real terms) in appropria-
tions for higher education. Even a

q" --modest improvement in this poor

record could mean millions of addi-
tional dollars for the university.

A faculty with collective bargain-
mg at Pitt can be an important fac-

in addition. thefacultv could
pursue through its collective

bargaining organization its own lob-

important complement to the
administration‘s. The faculty‘s
efforts in this area would be coordi-
nated with those of the administra-

tion and of students, as is they

practice at most campuses with sol-
lective bargaining.

An organized faculty at Pitt
would have significant allies in the
quest for adequate funding for the

university. The Pitt Professional “

Pantherettes,

Pitt Loses‘ 8
TWO
of Three

By MARIE HUFF

Q9, The Pantherettes are in a mid-
season slump of sorts, losing two of
their last three games. Both losses
combined were by less than a dozen

» points. Pitt’s' only win in the past
week was a 58-50 decision over
Edinboro.

The Edinboro game had a twist to
it, because Pantherette coach Judy
Saurer a warm welcome as they
nearly pulled off the upset of the
year. Pittjumped to a 35-23 halftime
lead, courtesy of Edinboro. The
Lady Scots shot a horrendous 27
percent from the floor in the first
half.

In the second half of play, the
Pantherettes could manage only
nine field goals. Meanwhile, the
Lady Scots came alive, hitting 50
percent from the field in the second
half. Again the free throw line saved
the Pantherettes. Thistime it was the
fact that Pitt sent Edinboro to the

‘charity stripe only five times the
entire contest. The Lady Scots
cashed in on two of those freebies
while Pitt hit eight of sixteen‘.

The Pantherette charge was led by
Edinboro transfer Lori Dolby, who
pumped in 16 points against her old
teammates. Gail Aughburns added
15 points to Pitt’s total. while Debbie
Lewis chipped in l2. Penny Welsh

The Panther swim team kept its
winning streak alive last weekend
by surpassing ‘the’ Mountaineers
from West Virginia, 75-38. V

The Panthers gave their graduat-
ing seniors an exciting and

 powerful last home meet of the
season. The four co-captains who
will be leaving are Chris Butts, Stu

Swanson,AJeff Trew, and diver Pat
Greenwell. These four seniors and
the rest of the Panther , team
showed "West" Virginia a team effort
that left Pitt with only three events
in which a Panther did not win.

Rick Carter was a multiple winner
for Pitt, ﬁnishing ﬁrst _in the 400
medley relay, the 50 freestyle and
the 400 free relay. Scott Shearer

contributed ll tallies and pulled
down 13 rebounds for the victorious
Pantherettes. Esther McCary put in

_ 18 for the losers.

Maryland ended the Pantherettes‘
nine—game winning streak, handing
Pitt an 83-72 loss. Coach Saurer had
indicated prior to the game that the
Pantherettes would have to minim-
ize their turnovers in order to win.
However, Pitt committed 22 mis-
takes to Maryland’s l2.

Welsh led Pitt with 24 points.
Lewis chipped in. l5 tallies, and
Aughburns added ll, while grab-

bing nine rebounds. Jasmina
Perazic dumped in 24. for the Lady
Terps.

The foul line was again the deter-
mining factor in Pitt’s latest contest,
a 73-68 loss to Syracuse’s Orange
women. The Pantherettes held a 30-

28 edge in field goals, but they sent L

Syracuse to the charity stripe 23
times. The Orange women hit 17 of
the free throws while Pitt converted
only 8 of 14.

Dolby led Pitt with 22 points,
while Welsh contributed 18 and reco-

vered 9 stray shots‘ for the Pan--
therettes. Lewis scored 12 points and_

. Pam Miklasevich ll in the losing
battle. Libby McNulty poured in 22
for Syracuse; teammate Mary Schi-

Women Gymnasts Win; Panthers Fall

By MIKE DICHIARA

The Pantherettes easily handled
previously l9th-ranked Ohio State
by a score ofl40-I27. The victory was
the gymnasts‘ sixth consecutive in as
many tries while the Lady Buckeyes
dropped to 8-2 this season.

The meet was not supposed to be a
runaway. Ohio State had scored I40
points during its previous meet while
the‘ Pantherettes had never scored
that high. Pitt’s I40 points is a new
team record. I

“I thought that it would come
down to the last one~tenth of a
point,” said Pantherettc coach
Donna Sanft.

Pitt's sensational freshman Lisa
Shirk won all-around with a total of
36.65 points, excelling in the uneven
parallel bars(9.5) and the ﬂoor exer-
cise (9.2). Shirk came into the meet
as the highest scoring gymnast in the
nation. In addition, the team was the
ninth-highest scoring nationally. but
the Pantherettes were not nationally
ranked.

Holly Martino and Karen Martin
did very well in the vault using new
routines. Both added a full twist to
their vault and Martino scored a
8.95 and Martin earned a 8.7.

The entire Pantherettc squad
looked extremely strong in the
uneven bars. After Shirk‘s 9.5, one
of the best individual performances
of the night. Roxann Evans (8.7)

and Bonnie Tressler (8.6) gave Pitt
solid routines to help the team keep
its lead.

Pitt was also impressive on the
balance beam. probably the tough-

est event since individual scores are ,

usually lower than those in other
events. The Pantherettes were led by
Regina Carson (8.9). Martin (8.4).
Shirk (8.35) and Martino (8.15).

The men‘s gymnastics team. on
the otherhand. did not fare as well
against the Ohio State men. The
Panthers fell to the sixth-ranked
Buckeyes by a score of 264.7-251.35.
Pitt came into the meet ranked 25th
nationally. the first time a Panther
gymnastics team has beenranked
nationally in quite a while. accord-
ing to coach Frank D‘Amico.

The Panthers’ equivalent to Lisa
Shirk is Bob Besong. The junior
turned in a sparkling 9.75 in the
vault. which should place him No.1
in the country. Besong also set a new
Pitt record in the high bar with a
9.25.

The men’s team set a new Pitt
record for total scoring with their
25l.35—point total. That eclipsed the
old record of 251.2 set the previous
week against Farmingdale.

Despite losing to the Buckeyes.
Pitt‘s performance had some bright
spots. Frank Kratz set personal
highs by scoring an all-around total
of 5l.35 (fourth for the meet) and a
T-bar score of 8.85.

      

 

The Panthers also had a total of
three gymnasts who scored 50 or
more points in all-around. Despite
losing the meet. Pitt won decisively
in the individual vault and T—bar
events. However. Pitt had its prob-
lems on the rings and floor exercises.
It was in these eventsthat Ohio State
took a commanding lead.

The Panthers are now, 3—l. and
their next meet will be at Temple on
Feb. 7. while the women travel to
Clarion Feb. 6.

“They (Temple) scored 248 points
two weeks ago and that‘s a tough
place to score." said D‘Amico. “I
r_eally want to win that one."
