Sl.EEPlNG ON THE JOB‘ LINE: That is what many seniors who wait in the
long job interview lines Monday mornings end up doing.

  

‘by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

As early as midnight they ar-
rive, prepared for their all-night
vigil with blankets, books, and
snacks. They sit against the wall
of the Student Union vestibule,
covering the steps leading into the
quad. If there are too many, they
actually- wait outside.

The sign on the door instructing
them to “take a consecutively
numbered ticket and wait in the
SU Ballroom until Placement Of-
fice opens at 4:30 a.m." is large-
ly ignored, since the consecutive-
ly numbered tickets are not dis-
tributed until 4:30 a.m. and no
one can enter the building proper
before about 6:45.

By 1, 25 people are in line, wait-
ing to register for job interviews.
Though assured of neither jobs
nor interviews, they have come
early to select the best of a
shrunken list of recruiters.

Normally, the University Place-
ment Service supervises 10,000 in-
terviews for senior job applicants
yearly. This year, only 7,500-7,700
interviews will be conducted dur-
ing the recruiting season that ends
the/first week of April.

"Because of the decline in on-
campus recruiting, the'Placement
Service recently limited the num-
ber of interviewsvpermitted each
of its clients to two per week—not
nearly enough to accommodate

_ every job-seeking senior.

One Monday morning. when the
new interview schedule was post-
ed, Placement Service Director
Ernest Holmok was greeted by a
line beginning at his second-floor
office, stretching down the hall,
curling down two flights of stairs,
and snaking around the Student
Union desk.

To alleviate this situation, the
Placement Service began passing
out numbers at 4:30 a.m. each
Monday morning. But eager stu-
dents have been camping out in
the Union vestibule in hopes of
getting their picks of interviews.

Despite the sub-freezing tem-
peratures, most of the job-seekers
in line Monday morning were re-
signed if not cheerful. People in
the front clustered together,

grumbling, mildly and spreading-

tales about the kid who showed up
at 10:30 {last week to be first in

Seniors fight lines, cold for jobs

line, while those nearer the line’s
end and the icy blasts of wind
from the quadrangle seemed
more pensive.

Debbie Boyer and Kathy Mc-

‘- Cleaff, numbers three and four

respectively, were wrapped in a

wooly green blanket. Boyer, -

searching for a job in math. ac-
cepted her. unpleasant wait with a
shrug.

“If you come any later,” she
said, “you don’t get an interview.”

Mike Ring, came late last week
(8 a.m.) and couldn’t get an in-
terview.» Monday, he was ready.
Armed ' with gloves, a brown
tossle cap, and a sleeping bag
stashed in the car for emergen-
cies, Ring secured the number
seven spot shortly before 1.

The first person in line must re-
main unidentified, since he was
asleep on the floor. The tailender
at 1:30, John Cornely, was-not
disheartened by his lowly rank.

“I don’t think I’ll be last after
a few minutes,” he said.

Cornely, like Ring, learned from

experience. After arriving ati5:15 ’

last week and waiting three and
one-half hours, he discovered that
210 people who had signed up be-
fore him hadtaken everyinterview
in his field.

Though agreeing that the sign-
up procedure is inconvenient, Hol-
mok views it as the best remedy
of a bad problem. Lottery or roll-
ing alphabet ,methods (A-G first
this week, G-M first next week,
etc.) would displease too many,
said Holmok, and changing the
sign-up time would prove fruit-
less.

“It doesn't matter when you do
it,” he said. "They’ll come six
hours early."

Penn State assigns "interviews
on the basis of free time in stu-
dents’ -schedules, a system Hol-
mok views as infeasible for Pitt.

“It’s really a good system." he
said. “but you need unlimited
manpower to get it out of the
house every week."

Holmok predicted that the tight
job market could loosen by the end
of the year.

“Most of the companies,” he
said, “tell me that there’ll be a
lift-off by the endvof the year, in
time for the October recruiting

No calls ’til April

115,000 escape draft

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

Thousands of college-age men
escaped the draft when Secretary
of Defense Melvin Laird announc-
ed Sunday that there will be no
draftcalls before April.

Losing -eligibility for the draft
were approximately 115,000 men
placed in the Extended Priority
Group, Sub-Group B in January,
said Phyllis Knowles, assistant
to the director of public informa-
tion at National Selective Service
Headquarters. These men are
eligible for the draft ‘through
March 31, 1972.

According to the New York

  

season.”

' But for now, the only solution
is to sit tight and wait your turn.
One student who left the line for a
moment Monday morning’. meti-
culous1y~ counted bodies until he
found his place again. -

“You know,” he said, "I've got a
night pass to get in there. But I
was thinking about what their re-

’ action would be if they came in‘
and saw mefirst in line. They’d

hangme. ”

Times, this group includes all
men born in 1951 _or earlier who
were classified 1-A, 1-0, or 1-A-O
by December 31, 1971, and who

had draftlotterynumbers below 125.

Many were draft eligible, the
'Times said, because they had lost
their deferment through gradua-
tion or other reasons; others, an-
ticipating there would be no draft
calls during ,the first quarter,
gave up their deferments.

The‘ Times also said lawyers
had advised men in Sub-Group B
in the process of appealing their
1-A classification to withdraw
their appeals.

Knowles cautioned that men
classified -in,Sub-Group A of Ex-
tended Priority are still eligible
for the draft. These men include
those born in 1950 or earlier who
have been eligible for the draft.
since December 31, 1970, but who
for various reasons, such as ap-
peals, have not been called.

“They would be called before
the number one lottery for 1972,”
Knowles W said, estimating the
group at 10,000.

According to the New York
Times, ~manpower experts have
speculated that no more than 40,-
000 men will be drafted during
1972. This means, the Times said,
that the ceiling on lottery num-
bers would be around 50. '

—The withdrawal of men from In-

Womenis

gym rules     1”

revised

by MIKE MILLER

A controversy over the use of
physical education facilities
erupted last week when several
men attempted to use unoccupied"
basketball courts in the women’s
gym at Trees Hall, in defiance of
an order by the phys ed coordina-
tor. '

"Dr. Carl Peterson, coordinator

of 'Men’s Physical Education, had .

ordered that men were not to use
the women’s gym while it was oc-
cupied by women.

The Pitt News received a letter

from Karen Farber, chairwoman I

for the Advisory Council on Wom-

en’s Opportunities, complaining.

that a group of men had disrupted

. a_ women’s basketball game in the

women’s gym.

The letter named Wade Lawson
as spokesman for the group of
men and charged him with defy-
ing Dr. Peterson’s order, intimi-
dating and threatening the women
with profane language, and re-
fusing to cooperate with campus-
policemen who attempted to set-
tle the argument.

The letter also accused-the cam-
pus policemen of refusing to take
significant action in resolving the
conflict.

Lawson told the Pitt News that
he had gone to the men’s gymto
play basketball and’ found it filled

,to. capacity. The women’s gym,

which contains four courts, was

occupied by only 10 women, he-
said. When Lawson attempted to

use the empty courts, he said, the

women protested.

He stated that he too had been I i 0

the victim of profane verbal as-
saults and that he refused to leave "

until he had spoken with Peterson.‘ - 0

A campus policeman accompa-
nied Lawson to a telephone to con-

tact Peterson and while he was ﬂ ,, :
gone other men began a game on ‘ - i

the women’s courts, he reported.

Peterson stated that he is insti- '~

tuting meetings with women and
Student Affairs and recreation
personnel to resolve the conflict
and insure that women will have
no future trouble._ 0

gave lounges to Blacks_, Latins,
and Asians on campus because of
the “presence of alienation and
identification problems.“

But before the Gays could for-
mally apply for a lounge, their
idea was attacked by administra-
tors in the school -paper, the Spec-
tator.

According to Manford, Phillip
Benson, director of Administra-
tivelnterests, said he doubted-

.-that Gay People could qualify on
A the bases of alienation and iden-
titypproblems. ’

President of the University Wil— P

ham McGill wrote, “It is not a
question of why one gets a lounge,
but where one draws the line on
who gets a lounge."

“As a direct result of the invi-
dious remarks,” Manford said,"

“the University Dormitory Coun-
cil, controlling all free- space in

the dorms, offered space to the ‘

Gay People for the lounge.’ '

The gesture by the Dorm Coun-
cil spawned a heated-exchange of
letters and statements in the

I Spectator.

A Black group on campus,
the Students for an Afro-‘Ameri-
can' Society, sided with the ad-
ministration. ‘

,,‘‘The SAS resents the classifi-
cation of itself, and.other Third

Worldgroups into a make-believe .

grouping of .oppressed minorities
along with social misfits, such as
the local’ campus homosexual
groupsﬂ’ ' 5

Members of the Gay group de-
fended their need for a lounge by
asking heterosexual students to
imagine themselves ‘in an all-
homosexual society where they

would be verbally abused, legally
sanctioned, even attacked for dis-
playing affection, Manford said.

Dorm Council defended its de-
cision by surveying all dormitory
students. Residents "voted in fav-
orof the Gay Lounge by a 2-1
vote. ‘

versity replied that it couldn't
judge the Gay's alienation be-

, cause it was based on sexual phil-
osophies, deemed too private for

their interference. »

The American Civil Liberties
Union then joined the struggle.

“The Gay People at Columbia

have openly requested that the"

University help them to end the
discrimination against them,”
Marilyn Haft of the ACLU wrote.

Set. for April 30 Q

According to Manford, the Uni- ,

py c..i...n1.i..1o...nge

“It is unseemly that the Uni-
versity hide behind a flimsy ex-
cuse that the subject matter of
the discrimination. against this
group is too private to be discuss-
ed openly and sanctionedby the
University.

“It seems highly unfair that this
group of oppressed people should

'be singled out among other op-

pressed, minorities to be discrim-
inated against.-

The administrations final ver-
dict was issued May 28 when Carl
Hovde, Dean of the College of Arts

and Sciences, issued an official

veto of the University Dormitory
Council's. decision to give the
Gays a lounge.

_The administration, however, is

apparently unsure. of its position.
Despite its official veto, the
Dean’s office issued keys to the
lounge to members of the Gay
group and established a fund
for them in the Dean’s office.

When Gays “sat-in" in the
Dean’s office demanding new fur-

niture for the lounge, the admin- '

istration acquiesced.

Meanwhile, the lounge, which
is being redecorated by the Gays.
continues to be a haven for Col-
umbia lesbians and homosexuals,
numbered by Manford at 4,000.
He described the room as being
informal, a place where Gay Peo-
ple can go and be welcome, a

place where—they can hold" whos-

ever hand they want to.

Community tentatively  

by GLENDA MINSHULL

Representatives from area uni-
versities and community groups
agreed tentatively on the com-
position of a joint board to over-
see planning and development in
the Oakland area.

If approved, the board will be
composed of four subdivisions: in-
stitutions, community groups, af-
fliated interest groups, and gov-
ernment. All subdivisions except
government will have voting pow-
er.

Inititally, 11 votes each have
been as signed to the institutions
and community roups.

The Oak and Chamber of
Commerce and the Pitt Tenant
Union have been classified asaf-
filiated groups and alloted one
vote each, for a total of 24 voting
members.

Whitman joins Council

of Economic Advisers

PITTSBURGH (AP)-—Dr. Marina Whitman, the University econo-
mist appointed last week to President Nixon’s Council of Economic Ad-
visers, said today she will quit her post on the Price Commission be-

fore assuming her new duties.

At a news conference here, she said she could not talk about eco-
nomic policies because of upcoming Senate hearings on her confirma-
tion, but she did say the Price Commission was surprised and pleased
at the way the administration’s Phase II was going.

“Stopping inflation is a little like trying to stop a car going 60
miles an hour in 10 feet.” she said. “It’s rather uncomfortable for the

occupants.”

When asked about her personal politics, Whitman confirmed she
is a registered Republican but said she has been voting recently as an

independent.

She said she and her husband, Dr. Robert Whitman, chairman of
the English Department at Pitt, would both take a year’s leave of ab-
sence and move to Washington if her appointment is confirmed.

If the plan is approved, each
member group is instructed to se-
lect one permanent and one alter-
nate representative to the board.

All non-procedural votes‘ will
require a_2/3 majority of the to-
tal board for approval. The pre-
cise definition of the word "pro-
cedural” has yet to be determined.

Michael Adams of the Allequip-
pa St. Block Club expressed con-
cern that the community groups
could not withstand the tremen-
dous pressures that the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh might exert upon
them. To avoid this, he suggested
that majority representation be
given to non-institutional com-
munity groups. Frank Little point-
ed out that a mere majority would
be useless, since a 2/3 vote is re-
quired for passage.

Sandy Phillips, in analyzing the
situation, said, “There is no way
to take away from the power of
the University of Pittsburgh
C-MU, and Carlow. This propos-
al merely attempts to equalize the
voice, if not the power.”

Louis Tronzo, representing the
University of Pittsburgh, said the

institutions - would not accept

something that denies them equal-
ity before they even start to co-
operate with community groups.

However, after lengthy discus-
sion, the board membership plank
of the proposal passed by a 7-6
margin.

At the suggestion of Billie Bram-
hall, deputy director of City Plan-
ning and the group's "chairwoman,
a committee was appointed to
capsulize the goals of the group to

facilitate the work of the repre- 4

sentatives when they report ' to
their respective groups to gain its
acceptance.

by LOIS LEVINSON

Woody Allen has found a way to compensate
for his inadequacies. He exposes them in a funny
play and exchanges the audience’s laughter for ana-
1yst’s frowns.

The result is Play It Again, Sam, fortunately a
short play because its one joke theme would thin to
a yawn if drawn out any longer. T

The title of the play is a line uttered dolefully by
Humphrey Bogart in the film Casablanca, and in-

_deed it is Bogey who is the main characters alter

ego.

The comedy is‘ about Alan Felix, movie critic
and neurotic at large. He’s the type that suffers
from homosexual panic, delusions of grandeur, and
bad breath even though he’s poured a whole bottle
of Binaca under his arms.

Allan, who takes his wife out for a candlelight
dinner and sets the table ablaze, is downcast when
she leaves him because she wants to "swing/’

To soothe his damaged psyche, Allan retreats
into a fantasy world of forties flicks featuring a
bevy of beauties who are simply mad for his pudgy
body. Coaching him through his very own Warner
Brother’s productions is Bogey——who else could
show him how to handle all the darnes?

To the rescue comes his wheeler-dealer friend
Dick and his wife, Linda, a model that Dick mar-
ried because “she presented a perfect corporate
image for an ambitious young executive.

Together they put together a series of blind
dates’ for him that rival his own movie-goddesses in
looks, but not in desirable results. As Allan puts
it, “I was out of practice even when I was in prac-
tice.”

Linda turns out to be a fellow emotional crip-
ple. Left to amuse herself on her own by her ever-
busy husband, she comforts Allan and they find they
have a lot in common. Both of them wash their tran-
‘quilizers down with Fresca and throw ’up under
emotional stress.

So our loser cum hero ends up breaking his long
run of ineffectualness by keeping his mind on Wil-
lie Mays so he can make love to -Linda. She won-
dered why he kept yelling “slide!”

Director S. Joseph Nassif keeps the gag-line
humor hitting forcefully most of the time by pacing
the play at a quick, crisp pace. The first act, how-
ever, was too fast and jumpy and left confusion

more often too heavy on stage right. There were
many. many entrancesand exits which began to bog
for lack of freshness.

Wringing his hands on his flabby overlap of
belly and gushing in self-depricating distress, Ken
Costigan displays great comic skill invcreating the
exasperating but lovable A1lan..Woody Allen wrote
the part for himself and of himself, and when I saw
him perform it all pigeon-toed in his infamous ten-
nis shoes on Broadway, I was sure no other schlepp
could do it justice.

Costigan, however, managed to go one step far-
ther and make him very believable. . . . He walks
and cooks his head in a manner that begs you to ex-
cuse blatant ineptness. The actor playing Bogart

‘ sums him up when he says, “You’ll do alright kid,

you've got style. It’s not how I’d do it, but it’s style.”

Peggy Ann Hughes was an appealing, inoffen-
sive Linda who seemed »a bit out of voice in this
performance. She was a bit too cocky at times for
a girl who could fall in love with Allan, but in con-
trast. to his fantasy women and blind dates. she
was a perky, down-to-earth relief.

An amazing make-up job was done on David '

Emge to change into Bogart. Although some of his
intentions were a little more James Cagney than
Bogey, his gestures and grimaces created a good
enough imitation to thrill a few nostalgic hearts;

The girls who played the dreams and dates
turned out spotty performances. None of them was
very memorable, but neither were their lines. which
is very important in doing a good job with this kind
of unsubtle humor.

In the Broadway production they used very at-
tractive girls who were overwhelming enough to be
a funny contrast to puny Woody Allen. This pro-
vided a much more comic effect than the half-at-
tractive rather diminutive girls used by the Play-
house.

The setting, Allan’s'\ apartment, was done in
tasteless modern and provided a platform for
scenes that took place outside of it. The huge pic-
ture of Bogart and smaller pict_i_ires of forties stars
provided the best key to Allan’s personality. The
lighting could have been a lot flashier for his fan-
tasies.

Play It Again, Sam was an innocuous farce
highlighted with moments of Woody Allen hilarity
that should be seen if only to suffer along with Al.

As a result of yesterday's pro
draft. ex-Panther stars Bob Ku-
ziel and Ralph Cindrich may go
head to head next year. _

Kuziel, an All—American center.
was the first’Pitt player drafted
as the New Orleans Saints select-
ed him in the third round. Cind-
rich. an All—American linebacker,
was tabbed by the Atlanta Falcons
in the fifth round.

An ecstatic Cindrich mentioned
the possibility of opposing his for-
mer teammate next year in a
phone conversation late last night.

“Wouldn’t it be funny if_we had
to play-against each other?” Cind-
rich asked Kuziel. “But wait, we
have to make the teams first.”

Kuziel had the distinction of be-

ing the first center in the country.

to be picked by any club.

“I had some indications that the
Saints were interested in me. but
I'm really surprised,” .an elated
Kuziel said moments after the
callfrom New Orleans had come.

Kuz admitted that he had really
no preference where he went, but,
“I just wanted a chance toget
draftedland play.”

Last fall, Kuziel, '6-5. 245, par-
ticipated in both the East-West
Shrine game and the Hula Bowl.
He was named honorable mention
on several national polls and re-
ceived al‘—East honors.

Cindrich, 6-1, 225, received sim— '

liar honors and was also named
lineman of the week after Pitt’s
upset win over UCLA. He played
in the North-South all-star» con-
test.

Twelve other linebackers were

"All of them were taller than me

The remaining _10 rounds of the
draft were held today.

Is fate mermen’s
toughest foe?

“It seems that fate is against us this season,” lamented
senior sprint specialist Tom Hayes who suffered an unusual in-
j-ury in Saturday’s Temple meet in Philadelphia. .

The 50 yard freestyle shaped up as one of the deciding events
for the Panther rnermen in the 63-50 loss. It was necessary for
Pitt to come out of the event with at least a firstplace finish,
and possibly something better. ,The.~strategy of the rest of the
meet hinged on the outcome of this race. Both Hayes and fresh-
man Tom Sm_ith knew this as they mounted the starting blocks.
Naturally, the pair was tense and nervously _“shaking out" on
the blocks. '

The 50 yard sprint is a race in which the start, the turn and
the drive for the finish are of paramount importance. Possibly
due to this nervousness and the importance of the race, fate
struck Hayes. I " ’ -

It seems that in trying to stretch his turn for a maximum
competitive advantage, Hayes turned too far away from the
wall, stoving his foot on the side of the pool. He was leading the
race untilhe injured his foot. He swam with allhe had in an ef-

E
1%

fort to catch up, finally making up, the differential, finishing ’

third instead ‘of first. .

As a result of this accident Hayes wasn’t able to swim up
to his potential for the 400 yard freestyle" relay squad which was
narrowly touc.hed out at the wall.

Also, Bernie Victor was sitting- this meet out at home with

the flu. He has been a steady performer in both relays, swim-

ming the team’s best time in the breaststroke leg of the medley,
andhaving consistant 50 second relay splits in the free relay.
Finally, considering that the team lost both relays andwas
almost shutout in the diving, managing only two points for two
third place finishes, the team made‘ a commendable showing
considering the 30-2 handicap with which they were collared.
Still, team spirit; is high and most optimistic for the
rest of the sea son. - by STEVEN WILLIAMS

one. Last year they beat -us by
only one point."

The Pink Panthers on a whole
did rather well lastyear, beating
WVU and Youngstown, and losing
to Temple by one point and to
Penn State by a slim margin.

The big defeats came at the
hands of Clarion and Slippery
Rock. However, the Clarion meet
saw a good performance by Pitt,

‘where the gymnasts placed sec-
- 0nd’ and third on the uneven par-

allel bars and second on the floor
‘exercise. '

Pitt faces these two teams again
this year at a‘tri-meet ’ Feb. 26

at Clarion.

Coach DiCicco commented on
the team’s areas of strength.“Last
year we were strong on the bars
and the vault. This year we excel
in the floor exercise and vault.”

The WVU meet served as proof
of this excellence with Pitt plac-
ing first, second, and third in both
these events-.* ’ '

Saturday the women whowill com-1 I

pete for Pitt in the floor exercise
will be Donna DeMarino, Donna-
Saunders, Patty Martin. and Judy’

Zamborsky. (Laurie Fisher may
stand in for Zamborsky. l

Going for Pitt on the uneven
parallel bars will be Anna Krupa,
DeMarino, Anne Monahan‘, and
Kathy Krynock. On the balance
beams Pitt will have DeMarin0,
Monahan, Martin, and Zambor-
sky. Vaulting will feature Mona-
han, DeMarino, Krynock. and Sue
Davey. '

don’t bother calling the Center for Human
Development. If that’s what you want,
just invite a few friends over and have one
in your gameroom. All we offer is the
opportunity to explore personal feelings

in a warm and supportive environment.

To be open and honest about the problems
everyone must deal with daily. And, .
hopefully, to work them out.

And the only thing we take off is our shoes.

For information about the Center and '
its programs call Shelly at‘ 687-1400.
