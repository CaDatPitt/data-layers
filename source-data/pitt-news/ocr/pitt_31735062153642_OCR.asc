Meditation on Memorial Day?’
——Tells of Lincoln. ‘

A SOLDIERS’ MEMORIAL

Dr. Allen, the Second Speaker,

9 Touched on the “Militaristic
Nation” and Its Bearing Upon
Civilization.

The convocation last Friday took
the form of a Memorial Day celebra-
tion. The session opened with an

‘ overture by the University Orchestra.

Secretary S. B. Linhart then made a
few announcements, stating that ac-
cording to custom, this convocation
would be held in honor of the Grand
Army of the Republic, and that two
representatives frlini the Duquesne
Post, No. 259, had been invited.

The first speaker was Robert D.
McKee. His topic was “A Meditation
on Memorial Day.” .

“The approach of Memorial Day”,
said Mr. McKee, “brings to the mind
thoughts of those men in whose honor
this day is celebrated. I have always
been interested in the observance of
Memorial Day ever since 1868, when
it was ﬁrst observed. This year --will
be the 49th that this day is celebrated,
and I have noted with pleasure the
increasing inﬂuence that this day has

_ Kreece, there were two
factions, they ilitaristicg or Spartan
body, and the paciﬁc, or.Athenian fac-
tion. Athens gave 'us architecture, his-
tory, philosophy, comedy’ and tragedy;
She had athletes as well, butshe used
them as models fortheir ‘sculptors.
When she attempted to invade Syra-
cuse, she was defeated. A military
rition cannot contribute much to the
\;iVi1iZa4t.iOI1 of the world. It is a mis-
take to think that militaristic er-
many contributes towards the develop-
ment of civilization.

sparedness is-injurious to the American

“Menaechme”. was the title of the
play which the Classical Club success-
fully‘ produced last Monday evening in
107 Th: .5 Hall. It was this play
which furnished the theme of Shake-

The production was witnessed by
nearly a hundred people. The mem-

tion costumes and the “make up” was
in every ‘case very well done. The ap-

Decoration day was a ‘gala day for
many of the students in the Univer-
sity. Everyab-ody was glad to have
vacation but many were disappointed
in. the plans which they had arranged
for the day, because of the continu-
ous rain in the morning. Especially
were the picknickers and tennis en-
thusiasts disappointed for they could
not indulge in their respective pleas-
ures because -of wet grounds. How-‘

Athletic Associati0I1- As I remember.
these doings in athletics were gen-
erally managed by: Committees made
up from the Calverts, lVIcGrewsv, Gill,
Hamilton and myself. However, We
did not devote all of -our attention to-
athletics; two literary societies were
ﬂourishing; a Dramatic Club was or-
ganized, oratori-c-al contests were held,
and Pitt's first Glee and Mandolin
Clubs were started‘ by Jack High; the
character of these may be judged by-
'the -popularity of the “Old Guard” at
the recent Glee Club ‘Concert. And
all of these « activities were conduct-
ed while the total number of students
reached about one hundred twenty. to

versatile real ‘athletes as Hastings,

for the sake of a few extrapoints in

is too much to expect of Pitt.

ndtor or ‘PITT WEEKLY
Dear Sir: ’

‘Something is_ wrong!‘ Sometime
ago the Woman’s Activities Associa-
tion of the University voted to allow

uate schools to participate in the an-
nual :Spring Festival. So far but few
of the men students have shown any
enthusiasm over the project and to
make the task of the Festival Com-
mittee more difficult, the girls them-
selves have shown a woeful lack of
interest in the event.

In -discussing the matter with those
closely connected "with the production
of the play, I ﬁnd that there -has been
a. depressing lack of co-operation ‘be-
tween the University authorities and
, Since the
May Festival is strictly a University
affair and‘ since the success or fail-
ure of the production will 7 reﬂect

Tech lost the chance of a life time
when the best they could do ,,to our
tennis stars last Wednesday was" to
break even. On past showings it
looked as though Tech would at last
-be able to say that a Plaid aggrega-
tionohad downed a Panthericrew, but

» when itcame to doing it there ‘was a

different story to tell- A
The ﬁrst two matches were easy for

Tech and it looked as though theyl

would make goo their boast. Beatie
easily took over South, 6--1, 6--1.
Davis took the ﬁrst set from Spindler
with ease, 6--2, but he was forced to
go into extra games to take the second,-
»7——5-. Howeverthat was the extent
of their doings in "the singles for Mohn

- and Myers came through with ﬂying

colors. Both matches were fast and
it was not until the matches were won
that“’either could claim the victories-

Yesterday the team lined up against
the strong team from the University
of Syracuse. The Orange team. is one
of the strongest in intercollegiate cir-
cles and Pitt was not expected to make
much of a showing against the New
Yorkers. The paper went to press be-
fore the returns of thegmeet. were in.

Tomorrow. the .team~ journeys to
Washington, Pa., where they will meet
the Red and Black team. The Pitt
men are going stronger now than they
were earlier in ‘the year and should
prove to be a hard foe for their op-
ponents to beat. Spindler, ﬁrst man
on the Gold and Blue aggregation, will
line up against the team that he played
with last year. He has been showing
good form all-ye,ar'Tand gives promise

of being one of the best men that ever

represented. Pitt?-‘on the courts. Mohn,
Wzillison, South and Haines are ‘all
putting up an improved game and give
promise of a strong team for next
year. It is hoped that a strong enough
team will be lined up next year so

that the Eastern teams can aTga:i.n be 3
‘scheduled. A 

Hard Luck Follows  
O A Pitt’s Ball Team

Pitt’s record on the baseball dia-

mond this year is not one that follow-
ers of the Gold and Blue ‘athletics can
pointwto with pride. Despite the fact
that the team look like a million
dollars on ‘paper, the record that they

T havemade is almost in the same class

with their neighbors. the Pirates. The
Pitt nine ’has engaged in just ten con-
tests -so far and -out of these have been
returned the victors only three times,
and two of these were won at the ex-

-pense of the Plaid team. Surely some

record.

"On the other hand the team from

Little Washington has been doing
little. better. Their few victories have
been won against comparatively weak
teams. The only times that they have
been lined up against hard teams they
have invariably lost. However Cap-
tain Heymaxfs team is out for blood

and threatens to make the Pitt team T‘
go some if they expect to win.

This game tomorrow will be the last
onein which the local team plays until
the games with Penn State, at Penn
State. These two games with the Mt.
Nittany team are scheduled annually

A for commencement week. .It will be

Speaking of baseball one fan sug-
gests that the trouble with the Pitt
team is that they are so close to
Forbes Field. Well,‘ there might be
something. to that. At least we must
have some sort of an alibi. Incident-
Tlyithe letters being, received ‘ from
alumni and others seems to} ,
favor of retaining the nationa sport
as a major’ sp.ort in the University.
It is rumored that a sweeping change
will be made next-year and that_base-
ball will be. put on the same plane as
football. Well, here’s hoping.

/

Due to aymisunderstanding the an-
nual Varsity-Alumni game will be
stagedon the stadium instead; of at
Forbes Field.» This game threatens
to be one for‘ blood, as the alumni are
lining up a team‘ of stars. It is rumor-
ed‘ that “Dick” ~.Hob1itze1,Twho-ﬁmed
with ‘Pitt in 19.10 will be on ﬁrst, and
“Tom” Healy at short. It was further
rumored although‘ later ’ denied that J. _
Honus Wagner, ’47 will be lent by the
Pirate‘management for the day, so
that he may renew old’ acquaintances.

sure point winner in many» of our
meets. ~ l —

That dual meet’ scheduled between
Pitt and Penn State for a week from
tomorrow, should prove to be about
the closest meet that the two schools‘
have ever engaged in. The -rem,a.rk-

the ﬁrst game of the year between
these two institutions. The two teams
were scheduled to play‘ a game on the
Trees Stadium ‘Memorial Day but the
condition’ ofthe ﬁeld prevented. As
a result theghvonors of the year in this
line of sport will be decided by this
one game. ,

' Captain Beattie will probably start

“Eddie” Langdon and “Joe” Matson

as*.Pitt’s battery, with a ‘chance of
using Hart and Sapper. “Stubby” Mc-
Creight, who shut out Pitt last year,
will probably do the ﬂinging for the
Red and Black aggregation. Neither
of the teams are going good this year
and a win by either over their old op-
ponents ;would go a long way to make
up for the other defeats that they have
suffered against other nines. Altho

;TRAIIE PRIZES [IN

E. C. Kirker, Col. ’18, spoke on the
subject “How I Became a ,Moon-
Shiner.” Mr. Kirker was chosen to
speak on this subject owing. to his
great success along this line; His
long experience in the work accounts
for his great efficiency.-

.“Eminent Men I have Met," was
discussed by E. H. .Ward’, Ed. '17.
Needless to say the men of greatest
fame whom Mr. Ward‘ has met are
members of the Prodigal Club. ‘

George.M, Kirk, gave a display of
dry humor in a short talk on “Pepper”.
This was a pretty ticklish thing for
him to handle -but his talk was not
to be sneezed at although the sub-
ject might be. ‘

J. C. Rhodes, Ec. ’18, spoke on
“Nothing”. He kept close to the sub-
ject throughout the speech. The talk
-taken as a whole, was a good example
of the subject. . .

The less said about the music (?)
furnished by the chosen quartette the
better for the various members. After
their attempt to perform, they man-
aged to escape before any serious in-
jury could be inﬂicted.

MERCHANT MARINES

New York, May 27.———In twenty-one
colleges and universities and in the
high-schools of New York City stu-
dents are now competing for the Na-
tional Foreign Trade Council prizes
for essays on the American Merchant
Marine. , I

When the Council, dwhich is com-
posed of ﬁfty manufacturers, mer-
chants, farmers, railroad and steam-
ship men and bankers, --representing
all sections of the country and col-
lectively engaged in the economic in-
vestigation of foreign trade problems,
last year turned its attention. to the
problem of establishing a greater Am-
erican merchant ﬂeet in the foreign
trade, it found progress diﬂicult be-
cause of “the general lack of knowl-
edge of the fundamentals of ocean
transportation.”
ber of the Council to offer $1,500 to
be distributed in prizes, mostly to in-
stitutions in the interior, in order to
promate careful-study of the shipping
question.

 

. In order that faculty as well as stu-
dent interests, might be stimulated,
the contest in each institution, or
group of institutions,‘ will be under
the direction of a faculty committee.

.. The competition is now, under way at
I the .’U-ni.versity»oif Wisconsin, Chicago,

Kansas, Texas, at Tulane University

‘in New Orleans, and Harvard Uni-

versity. A ﬁrst prize of $100 and a
second prize of $50 has been offered
at each of; these institutions. Similar
prizes have been offered for the best
essays emanating from the following

colleges and universities in and
around Pittsburgh: University of
Pittsburgh, Carnegie Institute of

W-omen, Duquesne University, Wash-
ington & ‘Jefferson College, Way: * s-
burg College, Geneva College, , {-
minster College, Thiel College, Grove
City College,/Allegheny College, Penn-
sylvania State College. » »

Three prizes have been offered
under‘ the auspices of the Iowa State
-Board of Education for joint compe-
tition between Iowa State University,
Iowa State College and the Iowa State
Teachers’ College. ’ I

The limits of the fund prevented
the offering -of prizes in a greater
number of institutions, but if the ex-
periment is successful it is hoped that
other organizations or individuals in-
terested in the development of the
vmerchant marine will offer similar
prizes elsewhere. I ‘ I

The subject prescribed is the “Com-
mercial Necessity for Developing For-
eign Trade Through an Adequate Am-
erican Merchant Marine.’_’ The essays
in each case are to be submitted for
judgment to the faculty committee,
and shall not be less than 3,000 nor
more than 5,000 words in length. It
was originally intended that the con-‘
test should close about commence-
ment time this year, but requests hav-e
come from most of, the institutions
that the period of the contest should
be extended to the opening-of the col-

graduating this June still being con-
sidered undergraduates, thus enabling
the contestants to do uninterrupted
work during the summer vacation.
These requests have been granted by
the Council because of its desire to
encourage serious study.

For the general direction of these
contestants the Council has had the
advice of its Merchant Marine Com-
mittee, consisting of Mr. W. L. Saun-
ders, chairman, and Messrs. Robert
Dollar, James A. Farrell, P. A. _S.
Franklin and James J. Hill, and.1ts
Committee on Commercial Education,
which is composed of Mr. W. D. Sim-
mons, chairman, and Messrs. W. L.
Clark, John F. Fitzgerald, Stewart
K. Taylor, Prof. Edwin F. Gay, Prof.
J. W. Jenks and Prof. G. L. Swiggett

To ascertain if the young idea can
be interested in the shipping question
before going to college ﬁve prizes
were offeredto the students of the
high schools of New York City, and in
the public libraries nightly may ‘be
seen earnest boys a.nd girls digging
into the standard textbooks. The
Council found early in its work that
many of the best known books on
ocean shipping dealt with the ques-
tion in a historical rather than an in-
dustrial way, and in order to present
the fundamental facts, of ocean ship-
