S.G. Board Focuses

On Varied Business

by JOAN EASTBOURN

The Student Government Board focused on awide range of topics
at its business session last week. including the Bookstore. the activ-
ities fee and Student Union policy.

-Primary discussion between the Board members. Bill Markus. as-
sociate dean of Student Affairs, and Jeff Pasek, representing the Legal
Awareness Committee of Student Government, settled on the issue of
night passes to the Student Union Building.

Legal Awareness had requested 20 passes "for..its members who

’ serve on arrest teams and need access to confidential files kept in their

offices in the event of an arr.est. Their request was cut to four by the
Board.

Bill Markus outlined Student Union policy, stating that people in
the building at night poseia securityiproblem. “The Union has always
attempted to accommodate students needing admission to the building
at night, but we can’t go beyond a point and risk that security.”

The total number of passes requested by the Board was 14: one
for each Board member, totalling seven; four for the Legal Aware-
ness Committee; two for the Medical Action Committee, and one for
the Tenant’s Union.

In other areas, the Board decided to acquire several stamps to
designate on posters and flyers those campus events subsidized by the
activities fee. This is another attempt to make students aware of the
use of the fee. — - '

It was brought to SGB’s attention that the Bookstore is no
selling the John Roberts line of class rings. 3 -

The Bookstore is charging the company with breech of contract
due to a lapse in service during the summer. Board President Tom
Bailey initiated a proposal to request the Bookstore to reinstate the

longer

.4§Roberts Company because students seem to favor the Roberts‘ ring.

’ ''They’ve been outselling the old rings four to one." he said.

‘Allocations of Student Government funds were made to the Pitt Ski

Club, the‘ Pitt News and the Legal Awareness Committee. The Board
also decided to recommend to the Allocations Committee. funding for
the Men’s Glee Club and Women‘s ChoraLwith the intention that the
groups also request University funds for their tours as this deals with
the public relations of the University.

By acclamation the Board decided to reinstate the CAS Cabinet as
a standing committee of Student Government. The Cabinet had been
abolished when the new Constitution was approved last year. Its pur-
pose is to voice student opinion in academic matters of the College.
It will act as an intermediary between the students and the Dean's of-
fice. Hopefully, similar bodies can be re-established in the other
schools of the University.

There have been alterations in
Szabo Food Service. from the en-
tire replacement of last’year's
management to the manner in
which food is served to the meal
ticket-carrying student.

One of the most obvious and
talked-about changes is the switch
to plastic cups for cold drinks and
paper plates for deserts. Last

. year glasses and small porcelain

plates were used. Although reac-
tions to the innovations vary. the

'r_najorit'y are negative.

Chip Cipic, a sophomore who
complained specifically about the
lightweight structure of the plast-
tic cups, said, “I feel the service
this year is noticeably worse than
lastyear." - A

Cipic also denounced the dis-

pensing of salt and pepper in-

small -paper packets near the
front of the cafeterias. He said
salt and pepper shakers at the in-

dividualtables were much less»

of a “hassle.” _
"A step down from last year"
is how Tower‘s resident Tom
Kuhn" described the changes. "I
don’t like the idea that they have
to give us plastic cups,’.T he said.
At least one student in discus-
sing this year’s food service
spoke ‘of the atmosphere of the
cafeterias. “It is bad," said soph-
omore Jane Petkofsky. "It pro-

4 motes indigestion?’

Bill Dyzak, however, who lives
in the Towers, expressed a differ-
ent view of the situation. “As long
as you’re eating,” he said, “it
doesn’t matter one way or another
what you’re eating off of.” '

Some students interviewed were
concerned about the money Szabo
is saving with the new cups‘ and

implications of this dilemma did
not occur to us until her plane was‘

companions, Barb Banze and H01-

to the airport by the Public Af-
fairs Committee and the Student
Union Board to bring Ms. Jorgen-
sen safely back to the campus for
her 2:30 p.m. speaking engage-
ment last Friday.

We carefully studied all of the
female passengers cautiously

travel case to Barbara and laugh-
ingly said, “That’s my cosmetic

ice was immediately broken.

In the next few minutes, while
we checked her baggage and ar-
ranged for a taxi we spoke to her
cautiously, then with more and

highi, manager of Szabo Foods at
Pitt, refuted this idea.

‘Describing plastic and paper
as “the coming thing in food serv-

terial, "It is more costly than
glass.” He explained that Szabo
spends $100 per day on the plastic
cups and that it would be much
less expensive to wash and reuse
glasses.

According to Haghighi though,
“One of the biggest problems is
sanitation.” Because of the neces-
sity of machine-washing and the

available detergents that can be

  Jorgensen-Transexual Experie

(Continued from Page 1)

(Wild thoughts danced through
my head. “Imagine being killed in
a wreck with,Christine Jorgensen.

'What would the folks back home

say”?l

As we bounced along Jorgen-
sen cheerfully and frankly di-
vulged bits and pieces of her life
story.

Since the series of operations in
the early 503 had completed her
conversion from a man to a wom-
an. Jorgensen has lived the life
of a night club entertainer. ac-
tress and author. In 1967. she pub-

‘lished the story of her life. and

soon after a film biography was
produced. She claims that her life
has been wonderful since her gen-
der change. _

But the years before the opera-
tion were far from happy ones,
Jorgensen said. “My parents
were marvelous people, very un-
derstanding,” she added. “My
grandmother was especially help-
ful, she protected me during all
those years when people made fun
of my sissified ways.”

-Jorgensen reflected on the years
she had spent in the army prior to
her surgery. Although she weigh-
ed only 98 pounds during this time.
she managed to_serve successful-
ly. After her discharge she trav-
eled to California in hopes of find-
ing work as a photographer in the
film industry.

This period of her life was filled

with self doubts and depression.
“I was repulsed at the thought of
homosexuality but I was definite-

. ly attracted to men. I feel that I

was always a woman trapped in
the body of a man.

Later when she spoke on the
Student Union lawn Jorgensen ex-
plained that “queer” people us-
ually fit into one of three cate-

Furnished
Apts.

gories. “Homosexuals are individ-
uals who are in love with mem-
bers of their own sex, or.with
their own organs. They would nev-
er consider a six change opera-
tion. Transvestites are people
who enjoy dressing in the cloth-
ing of the opposite sex, often they
are functional heterosexuals. The
third type, transexuals, are in-
dividuals such as myself who suf-
fer from hormonal imbalances.
They are women trapped in the
bodies of men.”

The series of operations to com-
plete the sex transformation were
performed in Denmark under the
direction of Dr. Harry Benjamen
in 1951. 1952 and 1953. According

to Jorgensen the first operation '

involved the removal of testicular
tissue. the second..the removal of
the penis. and the third was di-
rected toward building a vagina
out of tissue and skin grafts from
her thighs.

Female hormones were used to
stimulate breast development.
"Before the operations they tried
male hormones to ‘see if they
could make me more masculine.
but they didn’t work." she said.

At first the shy, reserved wom-
an hoped to keep the operations a
secret- from_ the world, but a
“friend” let the word out to the
zgess. “At first I was embarras-

sed, and I went into hiding for
sometime. Then I decided to go
into show business,” she added.

She does not deny that the "cur-
iosity factor" was important in
her success as a performer. but
she claims that as a night club
perf,ormer she was seldom sub-
jected to hcckling. "People aren't
usually obnoxious to my face. in-
stead they do it behind my back.

Several well known personal-
ities have made statements
which have offended Jorgensen.
including Vice President Agnew.
who once referred to John Lind-
say as the Christine Jorgensen of
the Republican Party. “I request-
ed a public apology. but I never
got one." Jorgensen mused.
"Maybe I'll get him in the next
election." -

_Another of her friends, Dorothy
Kilgallen, started the rumor that
her hairline was receding. Dur-
ing the speech she removed her
hat to dispel such rumors. ,

Jorgensen jokingly noted that
she had been banned in Boston and
that she and Ralph Nader, were
not permitted to appear on the
Johnny Carson Show. "I consider
Ralph Nader pretty good compa-
ny." she continued.

"Most men are not afraid of
me. Of course. sometimes I make

As the cab came through the‘

Fort Pitt tunnels Jorgensen re-
marked how much cleaner Pitts-
burgh is now than in the days
when she made her night club de-
but at the Copa. As well as ap-
pearing in night clubs, she has
starred in productions of Mary.
Mary and Oh Dad, Poor Dad. . . .
She also spent time working at
the film studio where her biogra-
phy was being produced, censor-
ing the script and working on the
production.

"I had to threaten to leave the
lot and remove my name from the
film to get it the way Iwanted.

By JEFF PASEK

With Pittsburgh appearances by Senator McGov-
ern, Senator Kennedy, Presidential son-in-law Edward
Finch Cox, and Committee to Re—Elect the President
(CREP) Chairman Clark McGregor, it appears that the
political winds finally reached the smokey city last
week. But before the miasma of mill soot is replaced by

a few facts about voting. -

In order to vote in this year’s election, there are
_ several things that must be done. First, you must regis-
ter between now and Otober 10. College students may
declar.e their voting residency either at home where
their parents‘ reside or at their college home. Since
1968, the residency requirements have been shortened
considerably. Now, voters must reside in the same state
and district only 30 days instead of _the custbmary 90
_days. .
. In Oakland, you can register at the fire house on
the “corner of Louisa and McKee Streets every Wednes-
day from 6-9 pm. and Saturday from 9 a.m. - noon.

I If Walking the six blocks is too much of a hassle,
you can wait until Oct. 4 and register at the Pitt
Student Union from 10 a.m. - 8 p.m.

' ' Students are not required to pay any taxes or own
property in order to register. If you are told‘ at the time
’-of ‘registering that your name is going to be turn-
ed over to the tax collector, you should "report this in-
formation to the State Bureau of Elections in Harris-
Vurgl
If you _have already registered at home, you may
change your residency to your school address.This can
‘prevent you from having to either go home on election
day or file ‘an‘application for an absentee ballot.

he Students who become 18 years-of-age on or before
November 8 may register up to the October 10 deadline.

If You ,Don’t Register You Can’t Vote  

You need not have proof of age or address with you to

’ register. The Voters Registration affidavit sworn by

the student is enough.

Once you are registered. there are two ways for you
to vote. The most common‘ is to appear at your local

‘polling place on the day of the lection. The other is to

submit an absentee ballot. It should be noted that you
may only vote at the precinct to which your registra-
tion is assigned. Each election, the Citizenship Infor-
mation Center receives calls from students asking where
the nearest polling place is located. Obviously people
cannot vote wherever they like, so it is to your advan-
tage to find out where your polling place is at the time
that you register to vote.

J;/’@7"ZE-"

 

Not everyone is permitted to vote by absentee
ballot. Only those people who will be absent from the
Commonwealth or county of registration by reason of

occupation, business or duties; persons unable to go to -

the polls because of illness or physical disability; and
persons employed by the State or Federal Government
are permitted to vote by absentee ballot. For example,
a Pitt student who is registered in Dauphin County
could vote by absentee ballot if he planned to be at

Pitt on election day. But a student from Allegheny
County who planned to be in another part of the same
county on election day could not vote by absentee bal-
lot. I

If you plan’ to vote by absentee ballot. you have
to wri.te to your county Board of Elections requesting
an application for an absentee ballot. Applications for
Absentee ballots will be accepted between Septem-
ber 18 and October 31. The ballots will be sent by
October 24 for requests received by that time and with-
in 48 after requests are received until October 31.

Once you have voted on your absentee ballot, it
should be returned as soon as possible. State and federal
laws are in conflict over when absentee ballots must
be returned. Pennsylvania requires that all absentee
ballots for state and local offices must be returned by
November 3. Federal law states hat ballots for Presi-
dent and Vice-President may bereturned until Nov-
ember 7. ‘ e -

Because of the confusion in the law, many ballots

This was only the beginning; McGovern was met by 5.000 in
Seattle, ,15.000 in Pittsburgh, and over 40.000 in Chicago. This

I‘m probably not the only one who has noticed
the Hare Krishna people lately. They are fairly
conspicuous. '

They can be seen in front of Kaufmann’s, down-

town. on Wednesday afternoons. and in the Uni-

versity‘ district almost any time. They generally
wear orange robes (technically they are probably
saffron robes); in cool weather. an ordinary sweat-
er may be added over the robe. The men frequent-
ly shave their heads except for a topknot, and they
all, male and female. chant religious invocations
in an ancient Indian language.

On principle, I admire them, though I do not
share their beliefs. By all evidence, most of them
actually practice the ideals they profess. They lead
a simple, vegetarian, almost pastoral life, even" in
the city. None are known to practice violence
for any reason, and the gaudier temptations of life
in Shadyside seem to affect them not at all’.

In addition to their dwelling in Shadyside. the

Hare Krishna people have a communal farm in
West Virginia and a printing plant somewhere. I
have no idea how productive the farm is. but they
seem to suffer no shortage of literature.

So far. all is well. Even nonbelievers_ can ad-
mire the thought that the proper worship of the

ally the finger bells, make a joyful sound. But they
go beyond this. ' ‘

They are zealous. perhaps too much so. They
seem convinced that they and their fellow Krishna
people have found the One True Path. and insist
that the rest of us should join them on it.

It is educational to be approached once with a
new message of salvation; a second contact may
help a shaky memory; but the third, the tenth, or
the thirtieth repetition of the same message is /a
nuisance. ‘

One of the nicest things about Freedom of

Religion is the right to abstain.
I would be equally annoyed if it were Bap-

tists, or Mormons, or Shintoists haranguing me‘

on the street. I know it must be painful to prac-
titioners of any religion to see individuals who
clearly do not qualify for redemption by ‘their
standards. All devoutw believers must occasionally
dream of a world where everyone is, like them. _a
member of the Elect. However, most organized
religions manage to restrain themselves, at ‘least
in countries where religionis neither mandated
nor forbidden.

Pittsburgh Symphony Less Than Impressive

Concert Debut Disappointing

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

A heavily Teutonic program
opened our symphony season this
past week as Dr. William Stein-
berg led his orchestra through
three compositions of a more or
less "symphonic" nature (sans
solil which had evidently been
chosen with the intention of im-
pressing upon our minds the
virtuosity of our— local musicians.
And while such moments of
virtuosity were not: entirely lack-
ing in the program. a number of
other important factors were.

Over "the past years. we have

noticed a certain tendency on
Steinbergs part to take his tempi

-at a slower cut than _that to which

we are normally accustomed in
regard to other conductors. True
to form, the program got under-
way with the Prelude to Meis-'
tersinger. and the pace .ot“the
composition was-mercilessly drag-
ged.

While the Wagner work is def-
initely glorious, certain moments
of the _“overture” lingered in_the‘
air too long and the joyful liveli-
ness of. the work deteriorated in-
to. a stale reconstruction of its

true spirit. One cannot help but.

wonder how much time a perform-
ance of the entire opera under
our local maestro’s leaden/baton
would entail.

“Mathis der Maler,” a sym-
phony of Paul Hindemith (cer-
tainly one of the most neglected
of all contemporary composers)
based upon "G_runew‘a1d's Isen-

zhein Altarpiece. rounded out the

first part of the program. In “Ma-
this,” Hindemith has drawn upon
the various sonorities of the or-
-chestra in an attempt to "tone-
paint" three scenarios t'rom the
Grunewald Polyptych.

These various tonal qualities
which the different orchestral‘
"choirs“ are required to pro-
ducc lend to the other mystical
aura which surrounds the compo-
sition. Unfortunately.‘ a profound

. lack of these very sonorities. due

to a very muddled orchestral
sound (Dare we suggest that the
halls acoustics may be the cul-
prit?i. led to a very unprofound
performance.

Despite the rather disappoint-
ing rendition of the program's first
two works, the interval brought
added expectations that the" Mah-
ler, First would be the highpoint
and redeeming feature of the en-
tire evening. The PS0 has per-
formed much Mahler in recent
years and Mr. Steinberg has carv-
ed out somewhat of a reputation
as an interpreter of the Viennese
composer’s work.

"Bringing off" any of the Mah-
ler symphonies is no easy task.
especially when we realize the

paradoxical nature of their struc-
ture: in the same composition we
may have a mixture of both pro-
foundity and. as it were. "camp.“
At one moment. the majestic pro-'
portions of a theme would lead us
to believe we were scaling Parn-
assus itself. while in complete con-
trast. the next theme may be
nothing more than a smattering
of Viennese cafe music.

Even though an almost frivo-
lous mood pervades Mahler's
First (even the funeral march
movement has a rather droll na-
ture.) the symphony is a thought
provoking one and its movements
lead naturally to the climactic
finale. (We might add at this

point that the horns made their '

usual contribution of wrong notes

along the way to the finale.
though this contribution was
somewhat less generous than "

it has been in the past.)

With the triumphant conclusion
of the Mahler. the first concert
of the season had run its course.
and satisfied or not.-we all made

‘our exit with thoughts ofwhatwe

had heard. Thoughts of the Wag-
ner and the Hindemith works es-
pecially ocupied the mind of this
listener as he left the premises and
it is little wonder that the achieve-
ment of the Mahler receeded
somewhat into the background

when he recalled the first part of I

the evening's program.

Enough can‘t be
second half effort against the UCLA Bruins in last Saturday‘s
contest.
I After having been run into the ground by the Uclans and
‘slapped with a humiliating 24-0 deficit in the first half. the Pan-
_t.h'ers sprang back and clawed their way to a more than respect-

 able“ finish.

‘The gridders seemed to have been completely recharged in

—g _ '_ the sc-cond half as they came back and collected 14 points in each
‘,5, [of the last quarters—they were a different team out there and

there was little that they could do wrong.

. For the secondweek in a row the Panthers received a
standing ovation from the Pitt fans. Everyone it seemed was

A ' 7 more than willing to sing the praises of the rejuvinated squad.

  
  

“It turned o‘ut to be a real football game
,,¢ during the second half.",acknowledged UCLA
" Coach Pepper Rodgers. "They (Pitt) refused
to give up. Pitt was a better team second half-
their performance was outstanding.

"We played all right. I'm not displeased
with anything,” continued the Bruin coach.

\
\

‘But I just have to give Pitt a great deal of
‘ credit—they never quit out there."

 

'  DePASQUA

A Even Pitt’s coach Carl DePasqua, although unhappy with

 the loss, still found much about Saturday’s game that he liked.

"ﬁrm always disappointed with a loss,” related DePasqua.

" "But l‘m really pleased that we didn’t give up in the second half

—we came back only to fight harder against them.-

. I  "I just can’t say enough to praise them." the football men-_

tor added. "They did a great job out there."

Pick any name out of the Panther lineup during the last half
of the game and a hero emerges. Even the quarterback post was
more than amply filled.

_ l.)ePasqua has been searching for a starting ‘quarterback
for _a long while and during the last half he was given a bonus.

g ‘Not only did he find that some one was really capable of hand--.
" I ling the quarterback position. but two players qualified as top
' _ notch pmzformers.

In the 20 years Leo Bemis has coached the
Pitt soccer team there must be many victories that
he has savored. Last Saturday at Lewisburg the
soccer team provided Bemis with what might be _
his greatest achievement as Pitt's soccer mentor.

By downing Bucknell University. 2-0. the boot-
ers notched the 100th career victory in the history
of Pitt soccer. which was initiated by Bemis in

1953.

'The Panthers went into the game uefensiyelx
sound but with an offensive line that had seen very
little action as a unit. The first half seemed to
indicate that both the Bucknell and Pitt defensive ,
units were going to control the contest.

Panther inside-forward Al Jutca had one‘ of
the best scoring opportunities of the game when
he found himself all alone in front of the Bucknell
goal. Jutca let loose a blazing shot but Bision
goalie Dave Millar dove to make a fantastic save
with only minutes gone in the contest.

Bucknell came right back at the Panthers with
a pair of booming shots that required grea_t efforts
[on the parts of the Panther fullbacks to keep out

of the nets’.

J.-uniors. Denny Kohlmeyer and "Fernando Car-

Coreer Victims

riquiry both blocked whistling shots that seemed
to be ticketed for the corners of the goal. The
-Pitt defense gave netminder Bill Haines excel-
lent protection throughout the afternoon and Haines
was never really tested with a direct kick.

Millar, on the other hand, had his work cut
out for him. With only 30 seconds left in the f}'.::§t
half, the Panthers barely missed at a chance ‘'0
grab the lead. .

Winger Ray Rex. stationed in front of the net.
took a centering passand headed the ball toward
the right corner. only to be foiled by Millar.
Millar was not able to control the shot and the re-
bound went directly out to Jutca.

With Millar off balance. Jutca headed the ball
for the short corner. Lady Luck seemed to be on
Millar's side and the ball sailed inches wide of the
goalpost.

The second half started with the Panthers pick-
ing up right where they left off. Jutca put Pitt on
the scoreboard early in the second period with an
assist from Joe Luxbacher. - -

Luxbacher had Millar at point—blank range bu
his shot carroned off the left post. Jutca then lifted

Bruins Blunt Panthers’    

Second Half Heroics

(Continueidyfrom Page 6)

, Jo.hnson gained 168 yards for

the afternoon and left the highly

touted McAlister the second. best

runner of the afternoon with that

run. which accounted for over
_}"_alf of his_day's work.

’IThough that play was the turn-

ing point of the game, the Pan-
\ thers refused to concede.

With Hogan slightly shaken up.
Bob Medwid showed some of the
potential which made him the No.
1 quarterback at the start of the
season. Medwidfirst hit Block on
a broken pattern for 46 yards.
After losing five. Medwid scamp-
ered for 16 yards and another
first down on the Bruin 23. Even-
tually. Medwid sneaked it in from
the one. _ /

Again. the Panthers failed to
convert the two point conversion!
UCLA led 31~2(). *

. edwid threw an interception
 a fourth and nine play the

next time Pitt had the ball, which

the bad boys from the coast turn-
ed into theirlast ‘score.

Taking over on the Pitt 46.
Harmon engineered a‘ nine play
drive._ the score coming on a one
yard plunge by Fullback Gary
Campbell. T

Hogan was still not through.
He hit Toerper on a 50 yard
"bomb before finding Wall in
the corner of the endzone for the

final score of the afternoon.

In that first half, it was all the
No. 8 ranked Bruins. Taking the
ball on their own one yard
line on its first possession, the
Bruins proved they could move
the ball the length of the field.
McAlister almost wasted no time
electrifying the 24, 315 fans as he
broke open and almost went 96
yards.

He was tripped up on a shoe-
string tackle by Mike Bullino.
However. that tackle only delay-
ed the first Uclan score. Harmon
hit on a 13 yard pass to Brad

Lyman on a third an 11 play be-‘

fore he scored from the two.

From their own 17. the highly
touted Californians launched
another drive—this one a nine
play 83 yard drive with McAlis-
ter scoring from the Pitt one on

' the first play of the second quar-

ter. giving the Bruins a 14-0 lead. ’

‘After Efren Herrara kicked off,
Clair Wilson fumbled on Pitt’s
next series, Herrara made his 36
yard FG attempt, which gave the
Californians a 17-0 bulge.

Their last touchdown" of that
first half came as backup quarter-
back Rod Scibner ran a fake
option 63 yards into the Pitt
endzone.

of their shots sailed over the crossbar or wide of the posts.

When UCLA first took possession of the foot-
ball Saturday, two people named Harmon were call-
ing the shots. Calling the shots on the one yard line
was Mark Harmon, the Bruin quarterback. Calling
the shots up in the press box for UCLA television
was the man who made the Harmon name famous.
Tom Harmon. ' ’

Tom Harmon was an All—American halfback
for Michigan when being an All-American really

meant something. Now,. more than" 20 years later.-

he was watching his son attempt to live up to the
Harmon name. and Tom Harmon was the broad-
caster.

After last week's upset over Nebraska. Mark -

Harmon started getting a lot of attention. The "word
was out that to stop UCLA you had to stop Harmon
and halfback James McAlister.

Pitt stopped Harmon. McAlister didn’t set the v

world on fire either. But Pitt didn’t stop UCLA. A
balanced team attack was what did the Panthers in.

Harmon ran the ball seven times. picking up

24 yards. a none too impressive average of 3.5,

yards. He passed only seven times. and completed
only three for a total of 29 yards. He did score a
touchdown. but it was only a two-yard run.

McAlister carried 13 times’ for 68 yards. a
more impressive average of over five yards per
carry. McAlister also scored one touchdown. a one-
yarder.

The rest of the UCLAns did the ‘Panthers in.

Backup quarterback Rob Scribner rolled around

of play that can break a team’s back.

In the third quarter. with Pitt rolling to pull

close. Kermit Johnson ‘went up the middle for an _

three yarder to put the game out

Up in the press box. Tom Har-
