Women’s Self-
Government

Association

Dear AST’s,

,' Things certainly move fast in a
war-torn world. It seems scarcely
any time since we Pitt women were
meeting you at the big reception
last summer and learning just what
AST meant and what you did.
Since then, we’ve studied in the
same libraries with you, watched
football games with you, drunk
tea with you in the Commons
Room, and danced with you every
Wednesday night at our WSGA-
ESGC dances. We’ve grown used
to seeing you all about us; we’ve
com.e to know and to like you, and
we are sorry to see you leave.

We are grateful to each of you
and to your group as a whole for
the many little contributions you
have made to our University life,
and we feel certain that your being
here has raised the level of our
school standards still a little higher.
We appreciate that, and we hope
that each of you has learned to love
Pitt and has come to understand
and respect our ideals, traditions,
and customs.

As I have said, we are sorry to
see you leave us, but we realize
and respect your eagerness to get
bn with your work. We want you
to know that you will always be
welcome at Pitt; do come back
when you can.

And so, for all Pitt women, I say
goodbye to each of you.

Sincerely,

Evelyn Ferguson,
president of WSGA.

Classes will not be dismissed
Vduring second hour tomorrow.
Students and faculty members
who are free are urged to attend
the AST assembly.

Assembly will start promptly at
9:45 o’clock in Soldiers’ and
Sailors’ Memorial.

G o v e r n m e n t

Committee

Hi Fellows:

After less than a year at Pitt
many of you AST men are leaving
the University. Someday we hope
g that you will be back on campus in
a diﬂ’erent kind of a suit and be
able to take part in all our activities.

While you are away from Pitt
there are some things we want
you to remember. Things like
singing carols at the Christmas
party, tea dancing at the Schen-
ley after football games, and
meeting girls at the Wednesday
evening dances. Don’t forget the
I Greek Room, the Russian Room,
i or Heinz -Chapel in the snow. All

these are memories for other
. Pitt men. Men like Lt. Col. Boyd
Wagner, Capt. J. C. Dunbar, and
Capt. Paul Bell. These men got
their training at Pitt, too. They
have set examples that you must
follow. Even though the job
ahead will be difficult we know
that your training here has pre-
pared you to meet these trials.

Between now and the end of the
war many of us will join with you
in the ranks. Some of us will have
to stay behind and get things ready
for when you return. Till that day
comes we will think of you and
know that you will do your best for
us.

When it’s all over I’ll meet you
at the corner of Fifth and Belle-
ﬁeld. We'll walk past the Chapel
in the shining sun that makes the
grass greener than before. You
will want to see the Commons
Room and your favorite national-
ity room ﬁrst. Then down to the
Tuck Shop where we will meet the
others; the “cokes” will be on me.

See you then and best of luck.

Bob Campbell,

president of ESGC.

It is always difficult to say goodbye to friends. We have all said our
share of goodbyes in these last few years, but that does not make it any

easier.

The usual “Nice to have known you” or “Good luck” sounds inade-
quate. Yet that is exactly what we want to say to the men of the
Army Specialized Training group who are leaving us soon.

It has been nice knowing you. We
have enjoyed meeting you at re-
ceptions and dances. We have en-
joyed sharing Pitt with you. You
have told us about your home towns
and your families. We have shown
you the spots of interest in our
home town and introduced you to
our families. We hope that you have
enjoyed it.

We do want to say “Good luck.”
You are leaving us to take an
active part in this war. We do not
know where you will go, but we

V hope that you will take the best

of Pitt with you. It is your Alma
Mater now.

You will be meeting other Pitt
men and women in service. Intro-
duce yourself to them.

With them, you can sing Pitt's
praises. With them, you will help
to end this war. And when peace
comes, we will welcome you if
you should ever return to the Uni-
versity with them.

Until we meet again, then, good-

bye.
