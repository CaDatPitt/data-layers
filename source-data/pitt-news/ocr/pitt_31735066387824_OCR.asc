Peace coalition to protest U.S. funding of El Salvador

By Kathie Roth
Staff Writer

Approximately 500 people are
expected to march through
Oakland this Saturday in a protest
of government funding in El
Salvador. The protest is in
recognition of Human Rights
Day, according to Peter Shell, a
member of Educational Action
on Latin America.

The march and rally, which.

are scheduled for 11 a.m. and
noon, respectively, are a “part of
an ongoing effort by the
Pittsburgh Coalition for Peace in
El Salvador to demonstrate our
concern for U.S. foreign policy
and to articulate our demands
for a moral policy,” said Ellen
Dorsey, a Pitt graduate student
who is involved with the
organization of the protest as
well as several groups concerned
with the problems of Central
America.

The Coalition, comprised of
numerous university and
community groups, has been
planning the event for the past
few weeks in light of recent
incidents of violence in El
Salvador, as well as ongoing civil
problems.

Professor Jules Lobel of Pitt
Law School is involved with the
Thomas Merton Center, a part of
the Coalition. In the past he has
also been involved in Nicaraguan
reforms, and even took part in
writing Nicaragua’s national
constitution.

He explained his involvement
as a concern for social and
economic justice in the world.

“I was involved in the anti-
Vietnam movement. [The United
States] hasn’t learned the lesson
of Vietnam yet. We shouldn't
prop up corrupt and oppressive
governments. ”

He said, “It was the dramatic
events in El Salvador, including
the murder of the sixjesuit priests
as well as the El Salvadoran
government’s reaction to the
recent FMLN guerrilla offensive,
[and] their refusal to negotiate,”
which sparked his participation
in the Human Rights Day events.

Dorsey has held a longtime
interest in Central American
affairs, and furthered her
knowledge by traveling to El
Salvador and Guatemala this past
summer to conduct research on
human rights and the effectsgof
U.S. foreign policy.

Pitt indoor sports complex
to be Completed this spring

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

Although the Pitt football team
is winding down its season, it
will be getting a big boost in the
spring, when the Charles L. Cost
Indoor Sports Complex is
scheduled to be completed.

Larry Eldridge, assistant athletic
director/publicrelations, said that
the complex will be opened
“sometime in {the} spring of 1990.”

The arena, which is projected
to cost approximately $4 million,
is built on top of a seven-story
parking garage located behind
Trees Hall on Robinson Street. It
will be used primarily for football
and tennis.

It was named for Charles
“Corky” Cost, a 1958 Pitt graduate
who donated $1 million toward
its creation. Cost was a three-
sport athlete at Pitt, playing
football, basketball and baseball
from 1956-58.

The university has had
problems in the past because of
a lack of this kind of facility. One
argument for it, according to
Coach Mike Gottfried, was that
Pitt is “one of the few major
football powers without an indoor
facility,” and this hurts them late
in the season, when the weather

  HNSHHDES A Tour of Dublin Taverns...see page 8   

turns bad. Gottfried donated
$50,000 to the complex.

The playing area is
approximately 385 feet long, 165
feet high and 62 feet wide. It will
serve as a full—sized practice
football field, as well as a nine-
court tennis facility. The
transformation between the two
is supposed to take about two
hours.

The surface itself will be made
of Poligrass. This turf, when based
on a shock—absorbing pad, will
readily accommodate the impact
of a football player, while still
providing adequate bounce to a
tennis ball.

But football and tennis aren’t
the only activities that will be
taking place in the facility. It will
also provide a practice area for
soccer, baseball, volleyball, track,
cheerleading and band.

The parking garage underneath
the complex houses
approximately 1,300 cars.

Ed Bozik, Pitt’s athletic director,
said of the complex, “An indoor
tennis and workout facility is
something we have needed for a
long time. It will satisfy a lot of
needs, and I envision our
students, staff and faculty using
this complex from 12 to 14 hours
a day.”

citizen who I talked to was
opposed [to U-S. involvement].
Of course I did not talk to
supporters of the government,
but I did talk to a broad range of
people, including United States
State Department officials.”

She said that many people told
her stories of horror that were
beyondirnagination. “You would
look at it and say that it was a bad
Hollywood movie, but it
happened to these people.”

She spoke at length of one
woman whom she had known
quite well. ‘Her husband had
‘disappeared,’ her son was
decapitated in front of her, she
was raped repeatedly by soldiers
who attacked her village and for
the next eight years she lived in
poverty, traveling the country with
two small children, trying to find
a way to live.

“It’s just a typical story; it’s not
sensationalized- She said that she
wanted me to share her story, so
maybe if people knew, then they
would stop aid. Many E1
Salvadoran people think there
should be no assistance [from the
United States].".

_ Saturday’s events will begin
with a gathering on Fifth Avenue

in front of St Paul's Cathedral_

-problem of U.S.

and the Software Engineering
Institute.

Lobel explained that the site
was chosen as a symbol for their
efforts. “It’s a symbol of the people
that were killed and the whole
military
spending.”

The marchers will proceed to
the Benedum Center, where a
rally will be held to unite the
marchers. According to
Cindy Smith, vice president of
Amnesty International at the Law
School, the keynote speaker will
beFatherJoseph Hacala, director
of the National Jesuit Social
Ministries. His topic will include
the slaying of the six priests, their
housekeeper and her daughter,
as well as a more generalized
discussion of the problem of
government oppression.

“We may have some El
Salvadoran refugees at the rally
who have been sponsored by
local sanctuary groups. They have
ﬂed the persecution of their
government,” Smith said.

The Coalition is expecting a
wide variety of participants,
including area students, religious
groups, labor unions and other
community activists, and

international affairs or human

rights to march as well, according
to Shell. 5

Paul Mason of the National

Lawyers’ Guild insisted that the

events in El Salvador are further
reaching than Central America’s
borders. “[The recent events] are
particularly pertinent in light of
Eastern» European affairs. The
Soviet Union just renounced its
intervention in Czechoslovakia
in 1968.

“This is evidence of the end of.
the Cold War and a bipolar world
that is controlled by the U.S. and
Soviet Union. It is important that
the U.S. recognizes these changes
and the new political structure of
the world.

“It’s important for U.S.
international credibility that it
begins to recognize the principle
of sovereign governments.”

All of the activists agreed that
though the protest willbe aimed
atboth the U.S. and El Salvadoran
governments, the primary
objective is.to end U.S. military
aid by attracting the attention of
citizens and lawmakers to their
cause.

The Pitt-sponsored course,
“Literacy in Context: Volunteer
Field Experience,” is designed as
a theory in language development
and a CAS reading course for
prospective education majors. It
will entail a total of 40 hours of
volunteer work with assigned
Frick students.

The School of Education will
combine its resources in a
partnership with the organization
Generations Together, as well as
with Pittsburgh City Schools.
Through this partnership along
with the grant, Pennsylvania will

become the first state to initiate a
literacy program of this
magnitude. A

Johnson, the course instructor,
views the partnership as “exciting
and necessary. Literacy is such an
important issue for all of us, and
this course is excellent for anyone
who has considered teaching at
all.” P

The three—credit course will
teach students the skills required
for a student to become a literacy
tutor and will include the 40
hours of volunteer service.

rSGB cotn’t rely on newspaper

The latest Student Government Board election process

. will conclude with the inauguration of the new members

on Jan. 9, ‘I990. Also concluding, we hope, will be the call

. for accountability through The Pitt News that someof the
_ members-elect called for in their platforms.

N 0 less than four board rnembershave made it known
that The Pitt News is the cog on which student acceptabil-
ity of SGB projects revolves. Unfortunately for those
members, that is not the case. ,

Nor should it be. The Pitt News is no more involved with
the SGB than with balancing the annual budget. A simple

article on the SGB, whether regarded as positive or_

negative, does not open the doors to the workings of

student government, nor does the proposed SGB—funded O

calendar that"may or may not find its way into the
newspaper,

It is up to the members of the board to make themselves

O accessible. Reliance upon The Pitt News would show only
» ..a lazinessand unwillingness of the SGB to help them-

selves and the students they represent._ , L
V The SGB’s most recent attempt at involving the entire
student body was the student recognition dinner last

— April. The ceremonies rewarded those student groups
, and leaders who worked all year to better the university

in their own ways. It served its purpose, but was only a

single effort to unite the students.

Perhaps the board could institute similar monthly awards,
honoring the best work of the ‘month by registered
student groups and members of those organizations.

If, Monitoring student groups is not the job of the SGB, but

bettering the university for all students _is. Rewarding
those groups, even with simple praise or a press release,
would show that the board does indeed exist for that
purpose.

The real call to accountability seems to ﬂow from the

board itself, however. If the board were to install an award’

recognizing the board member of the month and year,
perhaps members would be more involved in not just
starting but finishing their projects. Recognition among
peers is high praise. - .' ,

These are simply suggestions, not answers. But they
could be a step in‘ the right direction. And they would
show that the SGB is indeed a functioning organization,
not a clip for a resume.

editor and let your
voice be heard.

1 don’t know where to start this
letter. It would be very easy for

me to start by screaming that the-

whole world is racist or that I am
going to start an active campaign
of hatred towards the campus
police here at Pitt. But I won’t.do
that.

What leads me to feel this way
is an incident that took place at
the Pitt vs. Penn State game. I am
an avid Pitt football fan. Indeed,

I even served as a Pitt cheer— ~

leader for some years, voicing
my enthusiasm for the sport. But
what happened left me full of
anger and unable to even feel
emotional about the game, '4 de-
spite its outcome. The moment in
question occurred early in the
second quarter when a campus
policeman approached a young

black spectator who sat in the I

first row, three rows from where
I sat. The youth looked to be
about 13 years old and had been
sitting quietly ‘there from the
beginning of the game. The offi-
cer then asked the kid for his
game ticket, which the kid then
produced. This act, however, was
not good enough for the police-
man. He proceeded to check the
ticket as if with a microscope,
apparently tosee if the ticket was
real. The officer asked the kid to
leave his seat and stand while he
checked the ticket. He looked at
the ticket for two to three min-
utes. Now, I’m not Einstein but I
don’t have to be in order to
realize that a 13-year-old kid is
not going to be capable of pro-

ducing a counterfeit ticket good 2

enough to pass such scrutiny.
This continued until three other
officers had joined the first in
looking at the ticket. All the while,
the kid had to stand there and be
gawked at by the spectators as if
he had committed some crime. A
gentleman sitting in the row right
in front of me witnessed what
was going on and went over to
offer one of his unused extra
tickets for the kid. The police

I [officer] said that he couldn’t do

this. Why? Because they said so?
Another gentleman came down
seconds later and did the same,
and got the same result. I yself
and my girlfriend said that we
would gladly give up our seats
and leave so that the kid could
enjoy the game. What this points
to, in my eyes, is that the officers
had something against the kid,
and nothing was going to stop
them from kicking the ‘kid out.

The kid handled himself well
under what were very humiliat-
ping circumstances. They made

him stand for the 15 minutes or
so that this ordeal took. One of
the officers finally said that he
was going to go “check” to see if

the ticket was valid and took his‘

time sauntering across the ﬁeld
to go who knows where. What
did he do — call the kid’s mother
to see if she had bought him a

ticket? How do you check to see '
who bought what ticketfor what ,

seat in the middle of a game? This
is an impossibility considering
how many scalpers there are at
Pitt games. The officer ﬁnally
sauntered back, took the kid to
the field and made him, leave.
Maybe this was the best thing for
the kid, as some insensitive
people around me had started
saying things like “the kid stole
the ticket” and “kick him out."

Keep in mind that while this
was going on, as my girlfriend
pointed out to the policeman,
people openly smoked marijuana
in the stands, picked fights, and

drank themselves into uncon-

sciousness. Why weren’t the
police so concerned with enforc-
ing the alcohol policy in the
stands? Why did it take four po-

lice officers to remove this kid

when drunks roamed up and

 

Police actions reprehensible

down the sidelineswhere they
were not supposed to be? Some
fool thought it would be neat to
throw an empty bottle of Jack

Daniels at the cheerleaders. It ’

missed one of the girls by no
more that two yards. How would
this idiot have felt if he had struck
and killed someone? How would
those four campus cops have felt

if this had happened as they. V

huddled , around__ the kid? , I
watched all of this and my anger
grew without bounds. I just
wonder how the kid feels.

I kissed the Blarney Stone...and lived to tell the tale

“I’m going to cry if I kiss it, and
I’m going to cry if I don’t,” said
Maggy Van Vleet on the bus trip
on the way to the Blarney Stone.
She said she might not be able to
because of her sore back. I didn’t
know ‘what she meant, but I
didn’t ask either.

At the time I knew very little
about the famous Ireland site. I
had heard of it before and knew
it supposedly gave you some
kind of power if you kissed it, but

' that was about it. Oh, I also know

‘ about a bar that goes by the same
name, but that doesn’t help.

The bus was on its way to
Dublin, and in order to get to the
Blarney Stone, we had to go
several miles out of our way. So
if this thing is world-famous and
it meant that much to Irish people
like Maggy and we were going
out of our way to get there, I
figured it must be some kind of
awesome spectacle.

Willie, the bus driver and tour
guide, explained the legend to
the busload of tourists. He told a
story about a king with some

. kind of speech impediment and

how he saved a witch, or some
old woman, from drowning. The
witch put a spell on the king and
if he kissed a certain stone in the

Blarney Castle he would be given _

the gift of eloquence.
So that's one legend— kiss the
stone and you ’re given the gift of

clever, ﬂattering, persuasive 1an- '

guage. Willie summed it up in
one word: bull. Some Irishman,
I thought, making fun of his own
country’s history. .
Another legend ' says that
Queen Elizabeth (the first) was
having a hard time negotiating
with Lord Blarney. This lord kept
avoiding questions and not giv-
ing her any straight answers to

important questions (kind of like I

Mike Gottfried). Finally Elizabeth
got fed up and, after one reply,
exclaimed “This is a bunch of
Blarney!”

Another legend says that the
castle was once saved from at-
tack by persuasive talk. I’m not
sure what these last two legends
have to do with kissing a stone,

but the word blarney still means’

clever, coaxing speech.

Then I thought, this stone is
world-famous, and all it does is
give the gift of eloquence. No
promised lifelong health? No
legends like the Fountain of
Youth? No money involved here?
People come from all over the

 

 

world to talk better?

Well, it must be one (magniﬁ-
cent, huge rock then, I thought.
That’s what the attraction is — it
must be beautiful. I

Willie parked the bus and led
us in the right direction. The
admission cost into the castle
was included in our tour, but
other tourists had to pay at the
door. We approached the castle
and learned the stone was up on
the top of the battlement. No
problem, just climb up. After
whatseemed like’10,000 twisted

steps,‘ we made it up to the top.
Nice view. »
There was a crowd on the

other side where the stone was

situated; We walked over and I
didn’t see any big, beautiful rock
formation. I didn’t see any price-

less gems. Isaw a discolored slab .

of limestone that was part of the
castle wall. That’s it, huh? Yup.
Then,~as I saw the first tourist
go to kiss it, I realized why
Maggy was concerned with her

back. In order to kiss this piece

of limestone, you have to lay on
your back, grab two steel bars

fastened to the wall behind you I

and- bend backward at an un-
godly angle down a crevice cut
out of thewall.

A “friendly” castle employee is '

there to assist your bending at
that angle. Maggy‘ was taking it
slow with her back. The “friendly”
employee grasped her around

the waist, pushed her down to i

the limestone that blended in
with the castle bricks and picked
her back up. i

Everyone that kisses the stone
gets their picture taken by an-

other castle employee. They give
you the option of ordering the
picture for just three pounds

(about $4.50), and they’ll send it .

anywhere in the world for you.
Another souvenir option is the “I
kissed the Blarney Stone” certifi-

cate. That’s only one pound fo-r\a A

piece of paper —— not bad consid-
ering what we pay for a piece of
paper called a diploma. But this
blarney piece of paper won't get
you many jobs. (Come to think of

it, my diploma probably won’t ei-

ther.)

Th€I'€ are COUDUCSS other SO11-.

venirs boasting the Blarney Stone.
A piece of limestone stuck in a
wall is a’ million-dollar business.

Talk about the proverbial swamp- .

land.

Legend or not, that limestone
isn’t worth millions; I especially
with the rumors about what the
young Irish boys do to it at night.

Yes, I kissed it, despite the
rumors -— and bought the certifi-
cate. Hey, it was there. - ' I

As usual, registration time pergatory for student

I was extremely "busy when
registration began at the end of
October. Chautauqua at Pitt was
here and I was doing my best to
cover events while simultane-
ously mingling with people from

 the Soviet Union. To my agoniz-

ing dismay, I missed the first four

days of winter term registration;

Then, after the Soviets left, I
spent the next week drinking
cheap vodka. and mourning the
departure of Natasha, ”a sweet
little Russian girl with stubble
under her arms, with whom I had
a brief but unforgettable relation-
ship with. She and I spent every
evening she was here watching
the sunset over Panther Hollow
Lake. I

Then I spent another three days

. ‘trying to ‘choose which classes
would fulfill my spiritual and _

intellectual needs and make me a
well-rounded student. Introduc-
tion to Color would satisfy those
needs, I decided.

Anyway, when I finally got to
Thackeray Hall to register for
classes, I noticed that not one but
16 of the 17 classesl had picked
were closed. The only thing that
was left open was Conservatism
and Slapping Homeless People
101.  

Not only were all the classesl
tried closed, but the extra sec-
tions that were added just in time
for the Christmas rush were also
closed. Even Conservatism only
had five seats left. As I was
standing there looking at it, my

mouth agape, the five changed to s

a four right in front of my eyes.
Suddenly I felt like one of those
guys who work on the floor of
the stock market. You know, the
guy who yells stocks and prices

across the ﬂoor and holds little,

 

slips of paper in one hand while
making wild hand gestures. There
I was, yelling alpha codes across
Thackeray Hall to my counselor,
holding a handful of special
permission slips in one hand while

making wild hand gestures at the
ladies sitting behind the comput-
ers. A’ _

I didn’t even bother registering
for that one class. Slapping
homeless people is not fun any-
more, not when there are other
violent and fascist things to do to
people in Schenley Park.

The only thing left to do if I
wanted to go to school next
semester was to track down teach-

ers and professors and try to get

them to grant me special permis-
sion.

In the communications depart-
ment, there is a waiting list with
20 people in line for some classes.
In the English department, where
my major is, professors were
instructed not to give special

permission for any writing classes I

at all.

My only shot was to go some-

where like the history depart- .
, ment. Everybodyknows how
most history professors are; they’ ‘ ;

talk ‘til they are blue in the face to
anybody who will listen. I

So off I went to try to get _

classes —— any classes. I was able
to get a full course load, butl had

to wash three cars, rake yards of .

leaves, shovel two zillion snow
ﬂakes and pay out $300 in bribes
— I mean, commissions. But it
worked! I

I don’t know about the rest of
you, but I always read the graffiti
in public lavatories. What the
heck? It's something to do, and
it’s easier and less suspicious than
taking along your own maga-
zine. As someone who has in-
vested a great deal of time in this
pursuit, I consider myself quali-
fied to critique it. Well, I’ve made
an observation that I think needs
to be aired at least as much as the
restrooms themselves.

It used to be that the only
comments you could find were
unimaginative, sexual and vulgar
— no doubt the product of chil-
dren with poor toilet training.
But today, there is a cornucopia
of vandals with their own aims

x._

and purposes.

First of all, there is the instiga-
tor. This is the person who goes
around making statements just to

stir up trouble, for instance, “It’s "

nice to see one wall without any
writing on it.” There are nasty in-
stigators, too. (“Greeks are
Geeks.”) Instigators have been
around since the invention of the
john, and their crap belon
where it is. ’
Secondly, there is the match-
maker. This tireless soul performs

_ the function of a singles bar. He

seeks out people who have no
intention of having a relationship
but want something physical
instead, and puts their phone
numbers on the walls for the con-
venience of the patrons. (“For a
good time, call  The match-
maker is a busy guy. He also does
phone booths, park benches and
virtually anything else that can’t
run ‘away. Unfortunately, the
matchmaker doesn’t always speak
the truth.

Next is the informer, that help-
ful guy who warns us that the “All
Purpose Paper” is really a bunch
of used Pitt diplomas. (“This toi-
let paper. is like John Wayne -—.
rough, tough and doesn’t take
[crap] from anyone.”)

Then come the really dis-
gruntled ones: the political mal-

 

contents (“Kill the leper-licking
liberals”); the social malcontents
(“People who make socio-politi-
cal comments on toilet stalls can
ﬂush themselves”), and the
pseudo-intellectual politicos, who
throw around big words about
concepts they don’t understand.
(“Go drive into a —ing tree in
your BMW you conforming, ﬂag-

waving, capitalist” or the sinister

“Quo Flatus Pro Dominus.”)
To counteract this ill will, phi-

losophers have emerged. There

are the complex ones (“Reality is
a property dependent on refer-
ence frame, so all things exist to
someone”); and the simplistic
ones (“I crap, therefore I am.”).
Likewise, some well-intentioned
free advice is solicited. (“Put
Ciompi back on the power play!”)
One stall in particular provided a
question-and-answer service
called Ask Schroom (or some-
thing like that) for its inquisitive
visitors.

There are the conversationists,
who just make small talk. (“Hi
I'm the guy who was here before

you. Just thought I'd tell you I’m.

gay and have AIDS. Ha-Ha-Ha.
Good luck, brother.”)

And, finally, there are the car-
toonists. Some of these guys could
have an outstanding career in
graphics. Their representations
of their subjects are very detailed
and accurate, but is this art? I

think not.
Vandals come from all cultures

and classes. On some -walls, you . ‘

can probably ﬁnd as good an
example of a cross-section of
American society as in any his-
tory book. (God help us.)

The one common factor in all

of the above cases that also holds 9

true for the ancestors of restroom
writing is that the authors dem-

onstrate a remarkable lack of '

courage. If they truly believed in
what they were scribbling and
had any backbones, they wouldn’t

need to hide their words behind, ’

closed doors. It seems to me that
if the authors don’t find their own

words important enough to speak .

them, then they aren’t deserving
of the space they occupy. So
what are they there for? Enter-
tainment?

’Tis something to think about
next time you’re sitting on the
throne. And when you’re done,
don’t forget to “flush it twice 
it’s a long way to the kitchen.”

For Dublin locals, spotting Americans is no challenge

By Chris Bosak
Contributing Editor

They weren't shy about staring
at us. In our first night in Dublin,
the local Irish folk somehow
knew we were American, and
they acted like they never saw
any before. We weren’t wearing
hunting fluorescents or anything
like that, either. I guess it was
our accents.

Excuse us for talking different,
but please stop staring atus, I felt
like saying. Despite the seemingly
local hostility toward us, we
ventured into our first Dublin
pub. In a city as big as Dublin, of
course we didn’t want to limit
ourselves to just one pub, so we
journeyed to the next drinking
establishment.

John, Paul, Maggy, Sheila and
myself (same group as yesterday)
approached a place named
Captain America’s. Needing to
feel a little at home after all the

stares, we entered. Same stares,
different place. There was an
American bartender there,
however, and he clued us in on
some local trends. He said, “Stay
on the main street and you’ll be
O.K.”

Well, we didn’t follow his
advice. Besides, the next pub
was only half a block away. We
approached the next bartender
and almost got poked in the eye
by the spiked hair of one of the
locals. One local came up in
Maggy’s face and said, “You’re
American."

“Yeah, and I’m proud of it,”
Maggy replied. John, Paul and
myself almost ran for the door,
but stayed put.

“I could just tell by the way you
were talking outside,” said the
local, who obviously had been
downing a few before we walked
in. It was also kind of obvious he
didn’t want us in the pub.

We drank that beer fast and

walked swiftly to the lights. At
least what we could see through
the heavy smog. That experience
didn’t deter us, though, and we
hit a few more before heading
back to the hotel. Of course, we
kept up the tradition of keeping
the hotel bar open later for
residents.

The next day marked the last
bus ride with Willie, the driver.
We had driven all over the
southern part of Ireland and up
to Dublin, and this was our last

bus ride. No more Irish stories or .

folk music by Willie. No more
five—minute power snoozes on
the bus. This last trip took us to
downtown Dublin.

There were more Americans
out during the day so we felt safe
doing a little sightseeing. St.
Stephen's Green was pretty, but
it seemed like the ducks in Dublin
didn’t even like Americans.

The next site was Trinity
College. Trinity is a short distance
away from downtown Dublin,
just like Pitt to Pittsburgh. I visited
Trinity’s impressive library, which
contains over one million
volumes. I felt a little intimidated

in such a huge place with such a
rich history, so I tried to just look
and not risk messing anything
up.

I did learn some interesting
things about the Irish college life.
The percentage of enrollment is
about the same as it is in the
States. Half the people in Ireland
are 25 or younger, and there are
very few jobs for young Irish
students when they get out of
school. Many of Ireland’s students
study in either England or the
United States and never come
back. Most of those students who
do study in Ireland do so knowing
they will probably leave when
they get out. There’s simply no
jobs for them in Ireland.

Downtown Dublin was just
like any other big city. Lots of
expensive stores and thousands
of people crowding into space
made to fit only hundreds. There
seemed to be two jewelry stores
on every block. The big attraction
downtown was the department
store windows, just like here.
This store had eight beautifully
decorated—for-Christmas window
displays, complete with Frosty

the Snowman and Rudolph the
Red-nosed Reindeer. Yes, they
looked more impressive than
Horne’s. Sorry.

The fact that there were
performing musicians on the
streets playing for spare change
wasn't anything different, but the
amount was surprising. Every
block there was someone else
playing a different instrument.
Something else the street people
did was sell Christmas wrapping
paper for an outrageous price.
No thanks, I'll go in the store for
mine and get better paper for
cheaper prices.

The next couple of days were

quiet. The game was Saturday,

then we had to prepare for the

long trip home. About the only
noteworthy event was the people
on the tour getting together at the
hotel bar. Young, old, middle-
aged — it didn’t matter, almost
everyone joined in the spirits.
“Another round” was not a rare
phrase that night. Bob and Leslie,
Joe and Dot, Gary and Claire,
Mark: it was a coming together
and bonding of the week shared
in Ireland.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, December 7, 1989

       
as C  

 

By Jessica Lowenadler

For The Pitt News

Stereotypical types and icons
of black popular culture got a
pantsload of satirical buckshot in
George C. \X/olfe’s The Colored
Museum. The production is
designed to comment on the
perception of and by blacks today,
often outrageous but essentially
serious in its jokes.

Fasten Your Shackles, reads
the sign in Git On Board, the first
of the 11 “exhibits.” Miss Pat, the
perky airline stewardess of the
Celebrity Slaveship, explains how
to fasten them and announces
that they “must be worn at all
times.” Earphones can also be
purchased “for the price of your

\ first-born male,” for their flight

from the African Gold Coast to
Savannah. .

It’s made clear right from the
beginning that Wolfe and the six
talented black players mean

 

shake up blacks and whites with
separate—but—equal impartiality.
You may even find yourself
feeling a bit uncomfortable with
the raw revelation of the clash in
cultures.

Another skit involves a
prosperous member of the black
bourgeoisie who carries a Saks
Fifth Avenue shopping bag and
plops everything connected to
his past (his first pair of Converse

All—Stars, for example) into a

dumpster, ﬁnally adding to the
pile a contemptuous street kid
who represents his repressed
rage. “Being black is too
emotionally taxing; therefore, I
will be black only on weekends
and holidays.”

The five players, Bobbyjordan

Brown, Tome Cousin, Monica A

Farrell, Leah Maddrie and Maggie
Stewart, with the direction of
Clinton Turner Davis, extend their
talents to fit the versatility
demanded by the array of roles in

business. Although comedy WhiCh the)’ are C355 E3Ch

. Matt Dillon stars inDrugstore Cowboy C

By Lou Grieco
News Editor

“Most people don’t know how
they’re going to feel next,” Bob,
the central character of Drugstore
Cowboy says. “A dope fiend has
a pretty good idea.” _

‘This declaration of
predictability seems to be backed
up by the lifestyle of Bob and his
friends, who rob drugstores to
get their next fixes. As they
divide up the prescription drugs
they’ve stolen, they know exactly
how each drug will make them
feel. . ,

Such is the gritty realism of
Drugstore Cowboy, a movie that
pulls few punches. Set in Portland,
Ore. in 1971, the characters are
not one—dimensional, depraved
bad guys, but their self-destructive
activity is never glamorized. They
are all likeable, but they have

‘ their faults.

Bob, played by Matt Dillon, is

‘ the 26-year-old leader of the four- .

person gang. His wife Diane

‘(Kelly Lynch), his loyal friend

Rick Games LeGros) and Rick’s
young hippie girlfriend Nadine
(Heather Graham) spend their
time either shooting up or
scheming to get more drugs.
When local police start to watch
Bob closely, the gang has to start
“crossroading,” or traveling across
the country to find their next

targets.
Both

Bob and Diane have

served prison terms and are more
street-smart than the other two.
Yet, they are so superstitious that
Bob will not even let anyone
mention the word “dog” because
of the pet that led the police to
their home when Bob and Diane
were arrested. In a sense, the
gang is like a perversion of the
19605 nuclear family, with Bob
and Diane as dad and mom, and
the others as their children.

After tragedy strikes, Bob
decides to leave the life and go to
a methadone clinic. However,
the price for the straight life is
high; Bob loses his “family,” who
refuses to I follow him in
rehabilitation. Bob also ﬁnds that
being straight, for all of the
stability, is boring compared to
his old lifestyle.

“I like drugs,” Bob tells a social
worker at the clinic.»“I like the
lifestyle. It just didn’t pay off.”

This is part of the authenticity
of Cowboy. Bob grows tired of
the life, but he misses it. There is
no moralizing here, no bright
new life for the guy who quits
dope and does the right thing.
Now.Bob gets to work every day

at a machine shop.

Anyone who has ever doubted
Matt Dillon’s talent should see
Cowboy. He plays Bob as an
obsessed man, worried only about
his next fix. However, he is elated
after he injects the drugs into his
veins. While Bob may seem like
a lapse back into Dillon’s bad—

character is complex and should
give him the hit his career
dreadfully needs ‘after half a
decade of ﬂops. ,

The rest of the cast is superb as

Swell. Kelly Lynch’s Diane is a

Woman who seems to be

emotionally drained from the drug
life but realizes she cannot leave
it. She is still proud of some parts
of her life and tells Bob “I may
have been a lotof things, but I
never was a tramp.”

Nirvana
Bleach
Sub Pop

Mudhoney
Mudhoney
Sub Pop

The Sub Pop label has built itself
an empire around the sludge—rock
craze that’s taken hold of many of
today’s most popular underground
artists from the West Coast.

Based in Seattle,‘ Sub Pop started
off producing vinyl for the likes of
Green River and Soundgarden, and
over the years has expanded its list
to include a multitude of bands, all
cut from the same bolt of

ipower—based, fuzz—coated rock.

(Other Sub Pop greats to look for
are Tad, The Fluid, Swallow, Blood
Circus and Cat Butt, to name a few.)

Two milestones for Sub Pop came
in the form of the Sub Pop 100 and
Sub Pop 200 compilation albums,
which showcased a throng of very
diverse performers, including the
above mentioned, as well as bands
that have since moved on to other
labels. These groups include
Soundgarden (SST and A&M),
Screaming Trees (SST) and Beat
Happening (Rough Trade), to name
a few. T ‘

, While Green River had its demise
and Soundgarden moved on to major
label success with A&M, Nirvana
and Mudhoney have stuck to their

guns and continue to produce Sub ..i "

Pop style music for the ’90s.

These bands, as well as most on
Sub Pop, grew up during the early
'80s’ punk/hardcore outburst and
rediscovered the musical potency of
the ’60s and ’70s.

But leave out the politics and
important symbolism of those
decades, because neither Nirvana
nor Mudhoney is the least bit
interested in getting across any
earth—shattering personal
viewpoints. The only thing they
really are serious about is producing

fun, ballsy music, minus any
messages or political
overshadowing.

Nirvana presents a pseudoémetal
nightmare for true headbangers and
a wet dream for lovers of moody,
hard—paced rock ‘n’ roll on its first
full—length LP, Bleach. Many of the
group’s tunes are centered around
thudding, over—distorted bass lines
(just check out the opener on
“Blew"!), heavy—handed guitar work
and howling vocals.

There’s a lot of diversity on Bleach
(any good band should be diverse);
from the raging slap in the face of
“Negative Creep” to the moody,
borderline melodious crooning on
“Mr. Moustache,” Nirvana pumps
out a searing rock ‘n’ roll
retrospective with an avant—garde
touch of “music to come.”

It’s my guess that Nirvana and
Mudhoney spend a lot of time
together, because Mudhoney’s self-
titled LP taps directly into the same
schizo—rock deposit that Nirvana
excavates from and vice versa.

Mudhoney does corner the market
when it comes to distorted guitar
noise, heaping on so much muffled
grunge that at times any “original

guitar sounds” just fade into
obscurity. .

Mudboneyhas its share of near-
acoustic tunes with “By Her Own
Hand” and “Running Loaded.”
But “The Fartherl Go” and “Dead
Love” pay homage to Mudhoney’s
deity of pure punk rock, heavy
on the wailing ‘guitars and blood-
curdling vocals.

Mudhoney, Nirvana and most
other Sub Pop bands capitalize
on the stuff that truly great
underground rock is made of:
plenty of long hair, sweat and
overbearing noise.

Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future Part II \

By Richard Turgeon
Staff Writer

Bacle to the Futurells strangely
appropriate Thanksgiving release
date helped prepare me for the
enormous cinematic meal I was
forced to consume as I watched
the film. Much like my Aunt Dot’s
Thanksgiving feast, Bacle to the
Future Ilcrams so much delicious
fun and excitement down your
throat, you may feel sick when
you’re ﬁnished eating it. Not
physically sick, but overwhelmed,
confused, disappointed and onl
partially satiated. 1

The story picks up right where
Back to the Future left off, with
time travelers Marty McFly (Mi-
chael J. Fox) and Doc Brown
(Christopher Lloyd) visiting a
cozy, jetson-esque future where
McFly must prevent his nerdy
son from leading a life of crime.

The film tries so hard to top its
predecessor that it buries all of
the original’s evident charm in a
suffocating heap of Future's
popular elements while ignoring
what made it so memorable -
the human element. It’s got big
names, excitement, a rousing
musical score, expensive sets and
dazzling special effects, but it’s
devoid of Futures levels of
excitement or charisma.

Bacle to the Future 11 is easily

V

and inevitably compared to its
“prequel” throughout its entire
length. The script, written by Bob
Gale and director Robert Zeme—

Framed Roger Rabbita, never

Doc Brown (Christopher. Lloyd) and Marty

establishes an identity for itself; it
makes constant references to
Future, going so far as to reuse
footage from that film while it
deluges the viewer with rapid-
fire plot twists.

None of this can take away
from Bacle to the Future II’s obvi-
ous strengths that make it an
exciting and original effort. The
film’s breakneck pace and visual
wonders are quietly reminiscent

of Lucas/Spielberg—size cinema,
and, at times, come close to being
as extraordinary. The special
effects, created by George Lucas’
Industrial Light and Magic, are

‘I “He just hates people,”
Kostelich says. “There was
nothing arty about it — he just
hates people.” Magee left earlier 
this year because “he hates rock 
and roll.” He was replaced by '
Kasperowski, formerly of the
Heretics.
Some cynicism may be Q
Q attributed to dealings in the ($.34;
treacherous record business, 
which led Kostelich to start Get
I-lip in 1986. I '
“If you want it done right, you
have to do it yourself," says .
‘Kostelich, “I've dealtwith so many  ‘
nightmares, so many lasers, and “$4:
they really dragged us down.” 
Get Hip, whose job as a label
. includes promoting, production
' and distribution, later rnergedwith
Skyclad, a larger company run by
Kostelich’slong-time friend Dave w
Hall. ﬁx
Get Hip has around 30 bands R .
on its roster, ranging from locals
Half Life, The Heretics and the
Pleasureheads to the
Marshmallow Overcoat (from 
Arizona) and the Mighty Caesars ‘'9
(from England)" Many of these H
' bands playgarage rock, and are

Garage rock has never been 
big,—butconsistently ﬁndsasmall, - *
loyal audience in America despite
minimal exposure and zero
commercial airplay. ‘
A large chunk of the genre’s , 
ﬁaudience is overseas. 
I‘ " “There are commercial radio 
stations in Europe that care,” says '
Kostelich. “[We may! put out an
American record in the U.S. ﬁrst,
sell a couple hundred, then
double or triple that in Europe.”
Ironically, the band maintains
a mysterious ﬁanonymity in its A
hometown. While they play to ‘
packed clubs in New York, D.C.,
 and Buffalo, Pittsburgh shows _
often draw poorly, attracting no  -
_ more than 20 or so diehard fans. "-9
, “People don’t like us here," N
says Kastelic, “I guess they figure
if they don’t catch us this month,
they’ll catch us next time around! ”
Another reason for neglect is the 
local media. Radio stations 
(except WPTS) avoid local acts
like the plague, and the press
tends to favor veterans like Joe
Grushecky and conspicuously
new-wave acts like the Clarks ‘

Why?

 

If the Cynics aren’t known in 
Pittsburgh, it's not because they
haven’t been around. Kostelich,
the only original member of a
band that’s gone through 15
members, dropped out of college
with the arrival of pu nk in the late ‘
’70s. Sporting a mohawk inspired
by the crazed loner of the ﬁlm
Taxi Driver, he played for many
in a scene populated by
Carsickness, the Puke and the
Shut-Ins, andsoon became friends I 
with Kastelic and drummer Tom
Hohn.

Lady Panthers lose big for first loss of young season

By Sean Heilman
Staff Writer

The Pitt Lady Panther,

basketball team was crushed by
rival Penn State 9855 last night
at Fitzgerald Field House. It was
Pitt’s first loss of the season.
They are now 3-1.

Before the game, Pitt head
Coach Kirk Bruce said the Lady
Lions were a solid all around
team. They showed that against
Pitt, and then some.

Pitt could only play even with
the Lady Lions for the first ten
minutes, trailing only 20-17.

But then Penn State turned it
on to score eleven unanswered
points led by guard Tanya
Garner’s defense and forward
Susan Robinson’s scoring.

Pitt had trouble hitting‘ the rim
while Penn State was running
the Lady Panthers into the floor.

Penn State continued their
domination to take a 48-29 lead
before guard Dawn Chambers
hit a half court shot at the buzzer.
That was, essentially, the ﬁnal
blow to the Lady Panthers.

Pitt committed 19 first half
turnovers with Lorri Johnson

‘giving up six of them.

Pitt played more aggressive on
defense in the second half. But
they committed six quick fouls.

Penn State began to go deep
into their bench with about 12
minutes to play and a 70-40 lead.

So the Penguins have a new
coach. It was probably the best
thing they could have done
considering their abysmal 10-14-
2, Sth-place record (before last

night’s game with the Capitals)-

We shall see if a change at the
helm will really make a difference.
But one thing’s for sure, the
Penguins will need to change
their philosophy in drafting,
trading and acquiring players to
comprise a “successful” hockey
team.

With the exception of a few
players such as Mario Lemieux,
Kevin Stevens, Troy Loney and
Jim Kyte, the Penguins basically
have a bunch of men who are 6-
foot-1 and under and less than
200 pounds._These players came
as a result of the Penguin front-
office philosophy a few years
back of acquiring players who
were small and fast instead of
brawny and tough, the object
being to develop a team with
extreme quickness and skill in
order to be successful in the NHL.

Guess what? It ain’t working.

A lot of people are wondering
why Lemieux isn’t shooting or
why the Penguins’ power play
takes so long to get a shot off.
Consider this: when Lemieux is
handling the puck in the left

Pitt did not equal Penn State’s
first half total score until 5:39 to
play.

Field goals became rare for the
Lady Panthers late in the game.
Pitt shot 32 percent from the
ﬁeld.

Lorrijohnson shot eight for 23,
Maureen McConnell shot one for
12, and Lisa Fessler shot three for
ten. Johnson led the team with 18
points.

“We didn’t play good at all
tonight,” said Johnson. _“I lstunkll
It just wasn’t there tonight.”

Coach Bruce said Johnson was
trying too hard. “That happens.
But you can’t fault her for that.”

He said Johnson will never
play so bad as toshoot eight for
23 again. “(It will) never happen!”

“They played very well,” said
Bruce. “They’re tough. They
(have) a good bench. We were a
little tentative (shooting). We
weren’t looking at the basket like
we should have.”

“We won’t let this affect the rest
of our season,” said Johnson.
“We’re going to learn from this.
We (have) a lot of young girls
(and) it’s the first time they lost.”

Turia Ransom injured her right
index ﬁnger late in the game. It is
believed the finger was dislocated.
Ransom was to undergo X—rays to
determine the extent of the injury.

Pitt plays Saturday at the Field
House against Duquesne. A

point looking for someone to
pass to in front of the net, he
takes so long because there isno
one in front of the net.

The Pens have guys like Rob
BIOWII (5-11, 185), Bob Errey (5~
10, 183) and Dan Quinn (5-11,
182) fighting in the crease and
the slot for a shot against steady-
playing big men around the

 

league like Scott Mellanby, Mark
Messier and Patrick Sundstrom.
The Penguins are simply getting
pushed out of scoring position.
Ever notice most of their goals
are scored on slap shots? Probably
because none of the tiny team is
ever in front of the net for a
rebound.

Getting over the opponent’s
blue line on a power play for the
Pens is also a difficult task.
Whereas most of their opponents,
most notably the Flyers, skate
about four men over the blue line
at once to set up against the
Penguins, Pittsburgh has enough

trouble getting one man over the
line, thus the short—handed goals
for opponents, the inability for
the Pens to even get their power
play set up, etc.

Why? The Pens are simply not
big enough as a team to take
charge in the opponent’s end.
They are consistently getting
pushed off the puck, hammered
into the boards or being stood
up at center ice by big, brawny,
tough guys who can play hockey
and who are not just on the ice
to serve as goons.

And speaking of tough, why
do the Pens let hoodlums like
Dino Ciccarelli and David Shaw
get away with throwing punches
and swinging sticks at one of the
best players in the NHL? The Pens
simply do not defend their star.

If someone ever starts a fight or
swings at Lemieux, the Pens’
bench should clear and the
offender should be demolished,
thus setting the tone for what will
happen to another offender if he
decides to get involved with the
Penguin star.

NHL teams have no respect for
the Pens. They take cheap shots,
hit hard and play physical against
a Pittsburgh team that has a very

difficult time defending itself in

Lady Panther Lorri Johnson led Pitt with 18 points last night against Penn State.

Anderson's ﬂashy
play keys GT win

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Any time you see a kid playing on a college basketball team
whose best move is taking the ball downcourt on a fast break,
dribbling the ball around his back in the key and in traﬂic, then
slithering between two much taller defenders for a smooth
layup, and if this kid happens to be only a freshman, it is safe
to say that any time is show time.

This is fact: Kenny Anderson, point guard for the Georgia
Tech Yellowjackets, is show time.

The ball—around—the—back stuff with Pitt guys hanging all over
him convinced me in about a nanosecond. All I kept thinking
at the time was “What utter gall this guy has!” Some players
have trouble doing that stuff in the privacy of their own
driveway. Anderson waits until Pitt’s Darelle Porter and company
are breathing down his neck.

The skinny 6—foot—2—inch Anderson, playing in only his third
game as a Collegian, whipped in 20 points, whipped out five
assists and whipped down eight rebounds in his team’s 93-92
win over Pitt Monday night.

And, after three games this season, Anderson is averaging
24.0 ppg, 6.3 assists and three steals. A freshman, keep in mind.

“He’s excellent,” Pitt head coach Paul Evans blurted after
being asked to evaluate Anderson’s performance. “I've seen
him play an awful lot in high school. He drives well, rebounds
well, passes well. He does it all.”

“Easily, he’s one of the most exciting basketball players I've
seen in my lifetime,” his coach at Tech, Bobby Cremins,
boasted like a proud daddy. “Syracuse and North Carolina were
after him. I considered getting him a long shot.”

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, December 7, 1989

CBS analyst Billy Packer voices opinion on hoops

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

The Big East is once again
getting extensive television
coverage for its upcoming season.
CBS will cover 10 regular-season
games involving Big East teams.
CBS is also televising the semi-
ﬁnals and the ﬁnals of the Big
East championships. Billy Packer
is the man who calls the college
basketball action for CBS sports.
Here, Packer expresses his views
on some of the issues facing the

. Big East this season.

Q: 7heBigEastisexperr'menting
with a new rule that allows players
six fouls per game instead of five.
How will this aﬂect teams in the
Big East?

Packer: I don’t think it will
affect the Big East at all. If it were

a national rule, it would have a
more positive effect on the teams
that aren’t capable of recruiting
the powerhouse, 12-to-14—man
squads. It would help the
Richmonds and Rhode Islands
and Ball States more than it would
Syracuse or Georgetown.

Q: Another new concept in the
Big East this year is the ACC/Big
Eastchallenge. Is this agood thing
for college basketball?

Packer: It’s a great thing for
the fans [and] the players. It’s
probably a good thing to be
competitive that early. It’s tough
on the coaches, and in the long
run, from a pure basketball
standpoint, [it] will hurt as much
as it helps the teams. Those teams
are going to face so much solid
competition fromjanuary on, that
it would probably be helpful to

them to not have to lay it on the
line that much in December.
Teams will have to reconstruct
their season philosophies now.

Q: There has been a lot of talk
latelyabout changingsome of the
college rules and accepting some
of the Olympic and international
rules. What has been the reaction
toward this?

Packer: Coaches are resistant
toward a lot of the Olympic rules.
They feel that all of the sudden,
we'll be playing somebody else’s
game that was invented here in
the United States. I find more
sentiment going in that direction.
But a lot of people like some of
the international rules. They like
the play clock and taking the ball
out of bounds without the referee
handling it. They like the
international 3-point line, but
when you put the foreign diagram
on the court, a lot of guys are
resistant toward that. .

Q: Many people don’t like the
NCAA Tournament selection

, process. Is the current procedure

I
l

a fair one?

Packer: I've always been for
an open tournament, which is
what we have now. Of the 290
teams in contention, you really
have 275 with a legitimate shot at
getting in the tournament as of
March 1. I think it’s very fair.

Q: But with much of the decision
having to do with the team's
record, many schools are
lightening their load early in the
season to boost their record.

Packer: Teams can’t play a real
easy schedule in December. The
fans aren’t going to sit through
December and watch them play a

schedule that doesn't include:

some quality teams.

Q: What about the teams that

do bring in lesser opponents i
December?

 

Packer: That’s not all bad

They're staying at home so thei 

 

arenas can be full, and they pay
guarantees to people to, come in

and get beat. Why should you
put it on the line on the road? But
not all teams have schedules like
that. With as much that is on TV,
if someone can’t find quality
basketball in December, they’re
not looking very hard.

Kowalski brings World experience to Robert Morris

.By Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

Imagine the U.S. national soccer
team, historically not competitive
on the international level, placing
third in a world championship
tournament while beating top
national teams like Italy,
Argentina, Belgium and Brazil.

It actually happened last
January in the world indoor ﬁve-
a—side championships in Holland.

Five-a-side soccer is a miniature
version of the outdoor game. It
uses four players plus one
goalkeeper, and is played on an
area a little larger than a basketball
court (40 yards by 22 yards). with
a slightly smaller ball and smaller
goals than the outdoor game. It is
a popular game in Europe and
South America, where the game
is played on handball courts.

It is different from the indoor
game, as it is known in America,
because it does not have dasher
boards or artiﬁcial turf. The
American indoor game has six
players, as opposed to ﬁve in
five—a—side and 11 in the outdoor
game.

John Kowalski, former coach
of the now—defunct Major Indoor
Soccer League’s Pittsburgh Spirit,
was the coach for Team USA,
which won its first medal everin
a Federation of International
Football Association-sponsored
tournament; FIFA is soccer’s
world—governing body.

While other teams were

comfortable playing their own
unique version of soccer, Team
USA was busy devising its own
distinct strategies because of its
indoor soccer background.
Adjusting to positional roles that
call for forwards and defenders
to cover the midﬁeld area,
something that must be learned
in America’s indoor game, was
not as difficult for Team USA.
Also, Team USA made more
frequent substitutions than other
teams, a tactic also learned by
playing indoors.

Five-a-side soccer is a happy
medium between the lower-
scoring outdoor game and the
offensive-rninded indoor game.
“You need three or four goals to
win,” Kowalski said.

Kowalski is involved
extensively with all three versions
of the world’s most popular sport:
outdoor, indoor, and five-a—side.
He is often consulted by coaches
and other experts in the Major
Indoor Soccer League. He has
been working with the United
States Soccer Federation as a
developmental coach for the
national team, and recently
completed his first year as soccer
coach at Robert Morris College.

“I enjoy all of them,” he said.
“The rest of the world cares about

He won 30 games or more twice,
in 1981-82 (31-13), and 1983-84
(32-16). Kowalski’s Robert Morris
team had a record of 5-14 in 1989.
Pitt head soccer coach Joe
Luxbacher said Robert Morris did
not have many quality players

John Kowalski

this year. “They have some good
players, but they don’t have 11

‘ good players,” said Luxbacher

after a 6-0 Pitt victory over the
Colonials in October.

Robert Morris assistant soccer
coach Dennis Kohlmyer knows
about Kowalski’s soccer
credentials. Kohlmyer was
director of youth development
for the Pittsburgh Spirit when

Kowalski was coach. He has been
associated with Kowalski ‘ever
since.

“John has taught me a lot about
the game on an international basis,
[like] the tactical aspect,” said
Kohlmyer. :

Kohlmyer was initially offered
the head soccer coaching job at
Robert Morris last spring.

“I was not able to devote the
time. They asked me if I could
find somebody who may be
interested in the job.” Kohlmyer

contacted Kowalski and asked if
he was interested. Kowalski said
he was not busy in the fall, so he
took the job, keeping Kohlmyer
on as assistant coach. “This gives
me college involvement,” said
Kowalski.

Kowalski’s involvement with
the Spirit was mostly a winning
experience, but he had some
controversial players.

The Spirit as a team was
overshadowed by a couple of
players who got the headlines by
scoring a lot of goals, but seemed
to lack a good team attitude.
Those two players were Drago
Dumbovic and Stan Terlecki.

“Because they were goal
scorers, their psychological
makeup was different,” said
Kowalski.

He said Dumbovic was a type
of player who forced the offensive
attack, but did not work well
with the offense as a team and
did not help out on defense. This
made him unpopular with his

teammates. “[DumbovicI did his
own thing. He was unpredictable
[on the fieldl.”

Dumbovic’s ability to light up
the scoreboard was popular with
the fans. Kowalski said he cannot
blame the fans for supporting
Dumbovic because of the number
of goals he scored, but said that
he was not a good team player.

Kowalski noted that Dumbovic
has not been very successful since
leaving the Spirit. “If he would

have allowed himself to be‘

coached he could have been a
very good player,” said Kowalski.
Stan Terlecki was a Polish
national star who caused
problems for the team with
constant departures from and
reappearances to the team.
Kowalski said that because
Terlecki was a skilled and
valuable player (Terlecki was one

of the top scorers in the league at.
the time), the team was able to -

tolerate his attitude and take him
back when he wanted to come
back.

“Terlecki was one of the finest
players in the world,” said
Kowalski. “He became
controversial. He was _ very
dishonest. He would say all the
right things to the press and do
something else.”

Kowalski said that Terlecki was
a gifted player, but he developed
an “I” problem.

Kowalski is a key ﬁgure in the
U.S. national team's World Cup

By Kathleen Nixon
For The Pitt News

Rumors of coaching changes
have surrounded the Penguins
since the beginning of their 89-90
hockey season. ,

Although vehemently denied
during the last 10 weeks, the
coaching change was less than
surprising.

Penguin fans could be heard
chanting for Coach Ubriaco’s
proverbial head during home
games in which the talent—packed
team showed little enthusiasm
and struggled defensively.

In fact, the Penguins have not

performed as expected for most
of their last 26 games.

Penguin players have quietly
complained about their coaching
situation for the past few weeks.
Although never publicly
acknowledged, their
dissatisfaction with the coaching
situation was evident.

Mario Lemieux was quoted in
New York’s Daily News as
supposedly telling a friend he
wanted the coach fired or he
wanted to be traded. When the
author of that article tried to
question him the day after it was
published, Lemieux emphatically
stated that the article was in bad

then stood up and walked away
refusing any questions from

Other players also refused to
answer any relevant questions
about the coaching rumors, at
least not on the record. The end
seemed near.

It was during an early morning
news conference on Dec. 5 that
the axe fell. Edward]. DeBartolo

he and his father had discussed

This short drama portrays the problem of domestic violence within the Latino Community, where
this generalized social problem assumes particular characteristics because of cultural, religious and
economic factors. The video focuses on a Hispanic Family — including mother, father, two teenage
children and grandparents - showing how the father's machismo has intimidated both wife and
daughter into continual fear of physical abuse and alienated the son who resents his father's _
authoritarian attitudes. Tensions within the family explode when the father resorts to violence to

_THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Thursday, December 7, 1989

both general manager Tony
Esposito and Coach Gene
Ubriaco. Craig Patrick, formerly
general manager of the New York
Islanders for six successful years,
until, ironically, he was replaced
by Phil Esposito, was named to
the g.m. seat and as interim coach
until a suitable coach was found.

Throughout the last few weeks,
rumors of a shakeup in the
Penguin management had been
recurrent. The firing of Gene
Ubriaco seemed inevitable.
Esposito came as more of a
surprise. '

Tony Esposito came to the
Penguins on April 14, 1988, and
was very successful during his
first term as manager. Under his
direction, the Penguins qualified
for the playoffs for the first time
in seven seasons, and he was
responsible for the new talents
that dominate the game today.

All-star goaltender Tom
Barrasso, defensemen Jim Kyte
and Gord Dineen, center Randy
Gilhen, right-winger
McBain and backup goalie
Wendell Young were all trades
under Esposito. Center John
Cullen, who had 12 goals and 57
assists in the 88-89 season alone,
was signed as a free agent, as was
defenseman Gilbert Delorme, and
'right—winger Mark Recchi was

acquired in the draft.

But called “perhaps his biggest
mistake” was Esposito’s hiring of
Gene’ Ubriaco.

Coach Ubriaco, although he
led the then-defunct Penguins to
the quarterfinals last year, lost the
respect of his players as early as
the end of last season.

The Penguins don’t seem to

. have a problem with respect for

Craig Patrick‘. After meeting
Patrick, Center Dan Quinn said,
“He (Patrick) has been around
the league,  we have a lot of
respect for him.” » ’

E.J. DeBartoloJr. expressed his
satisfaction with Patrick‘ at the
press conference. “We feel very,
very confident Craig Patrick will
beable to run this team in the
direction we would like to see it
go.”

The DeBartolos realize that the

‘Espositds dismissal a surprise, Ubriaco's dismissal was not

Penguins possess tremendous
talent and believe they will beneﬁt
from Patrick’s leadership. “With
the talent on the team,  we
should be  at the top,” said
DeBartolo Jr.

The 45-year-old Patrick,
originally from Detroit, Mich.,
spent the last two years as athletic
director for the University of
Denver and knows what the first
line of business with the Penguins
will be. “There hasn't been  a
good defensive system; we'll get
that instituted as fast as we can.
It’s not going to happen overnight,
but we’ll work at it on a day—to—
day basis.  The things I will
stress are conditioning, hard work
and an adherence to a defensive
system.” I 7 I .

The lack of defensive strategy
is part of the reason Ubriaco was
ousted. Perhaps the rest of the
reason was simply because an
unhappy team does not play well.

Right winger Rob Brown stated
after their last practice with
Ubriaco, “We’re concentrating on
ourselves.  I think that if we'd
play to our potential and we’d get
everything in our system ironed

I out, thatwe’ll be very successful.”

’ Outstanding defenseman Paul
Coffey commented on how_the
rumors affected their game, “We
don’t even really hear it  we just
go out and play, I mean, it’s really
none of our business.” But
presently, since the management
change, the entire team is happy
with the results, and player

improvementshould notbe long 

from now. i H "

Two weeks ago, it was not
possible to get‘ Ubriaco to
comment on the disse ntion within
his team. His pat response to the
idea: “a player told me that
there’s no problem.  what goes
on in the locker room is between
me and my guys.” Healso said
that he hoped his players would
do the same.

Ubriaco had only rave reviews It 

of the support he got from Tony

Esposito, also, “[Tonyl has been ,

more supportive than you could
ever dream, and I told him not to

' jeopardize his position either.”

Kowalski

Continued from page 23

effort. He is currently working
 with a player development
program formed by the USSF to

help improve the skill level of top
American players and to prepare
them for future international play.

All potential national team players
must work through this program.
Before the U.S. national team’s

World Cup qualifying match
against Trinidad and Tobago, the

:9 * USSF had no money to continue
development. The U.S. victory
against Trinidad and Tobago (1-

0) meant a $1 million reward for
qualifying for the 1990 World

Cup. The United States’ failure to

qualifyﬂvwould have meant no ,

funds to continue the
development until television
revenue for the 1994 World Cup,
 which the United States will host,

begins to come in sometime next

summer.

. A, six—month layoff in
development would have been
disastrous , to U.S. soccer
development.

Kowalski has recently been
named by F IFA as an instructor to
Asian nations for the indoor game;
and he conducts his own national
soccer camp, the “Star Striker”
soccer school.

3 Kowalski said» the skill level in
America has improved over the
past 10 years, thanks to better
youth—1evel development. He has
noticed a change in co1lege—level
soccer.

“Back in the ‘70s,’T said
Kowalski, “there were four or
 five good players on a good

A team, plus a bunch of average
players. Now a good team has an

‘I

entire roster of good players. But .

there are no outstanding players
because there is too short a period
of time to develop [the players].”

The NCAA limits its fall soccer
schedule to about three months
(mid-August through October).
Kowalski says a change in NCAA
rules extending the schedule in
the fall and continuing it in the
spring would improve an
American player’s skill level by
adding experience.

Kowalski added one more rule
change, concerning substitution,
which would improve a player’s
skill level. He would like to see
the NCAA limit the number of
players a team can use in a game
to 18 (a rule which currently

ii}

.p;.,W

exists, but allows unlimited
substitution pending both
coaches’ approval before a game),
and add a rule that a player who
leaves the game must miss either
the rest of the half or the rest of
the game.

Kowalski said these rules would
reduce injuries. Players would
have to pace themselves and use
their heads more on the field,
deciding whether or not to take
a chance. This would cause
players to improve mentally, he
said.

This would then improve the

skills of players moving on to the
developmental program that
Kowalski coaches.’
' PittCoachJoe Luxbacher thinks
the current substitution rule is
fine, in case a game turns into a
blowout, so that other players
can get some experience.

“A lot of coaches think it’s
hurting us on the international
level because [the_ players] are
not used to playing 90 minutes,"
said Luxbacher. He then asked,
“Is it the job of the high school or
college level to prepare [a player]
for the international level?” This
is currently a hot topic among
America's soccer coaches.

Kowalski plans to become
more involved with the MISL
than in recent years.

The MISL has named a new
commissioner for the 1989-90
season. Earl Foreman, who was
the league’s first commissioner,
succeeds Bill Kentling.

“I like the transition they have
made,” said Kowalski. “[Foremanl
will take the league upto where
it used to be and probably over
and beyond that.”

Kowalski said Foreman is
looking to bring media exposure
to the league, something it lost
under Kentling’s reign.

Kowalski said he was not
interested in involvement with
the MISL while Kentling was
commissioner. “He didn’t know
if a soccer ball was stuffedlor
pumped. He was an idiot running

the league."

Kowalski will look to become
more involved as a consultant
now that Foreman is back as
commissioner. He said he has
had job offers with the league
but is not interested because of
his busy schedule with soccer all

program is similar to that of
showing up inside an illegal
fireworks factory.

Ka-boom!! Instant excitement.
Instant fun, if you’re not on the
other team trying to catch him,
that is.

He reminds one of a cross
between Pearl Washington and
Johnny Dawkins. Flashy, yet
steady. Explosive, yet consistent.
A sly lefty. A mix of ooohs and
aaaahs with a dab of
speechlessness here and there.

“I can dominate games,” he
says rather, uh, humbly. “Maybe

not by scoring 50 points like [LSU »

guard] Chris Jackson does, but
I’ll get 25 points and 12 assists.
Coach Cremins is going to let me
do my thing on the court and I’m
not going to back down from
anything. I'm a New York City
player. I’ve faced the tough
competition.”

His high school uniform was
recently retired to the Basketball
Hall of Fame as a tribute to
Anderson being named All New
York City after his freshman year.
And sophomore year. And junior
year. And senior year.‘

He was named the 1988 High
School Player of the Year after

averaging 32.2 ppg his senior
season.

Now, this Anderson isn't totally
infallible, mind you. He made
several glaring freshman mistakes
against Pitt. A couple of poor
passes. A few bad shots (some of
which went in). And much credit
should be given to Porter, who
did a fantastic job guarding him,
about as good as anyone can.

Anderson also puts up

somewhat of a set shot when he's .

out on the perimeter, which might
cause him trouble against some
of the quicker leaping guards in
college basketball. ‘

regulation play or in

, extracurricular brawls.

Look at the Penguins’ leading
scorers, Lemieux and Stevens.
Two rather large individuals in
double figures.‘ The rest of the
team, with the exception of John
Cullen, is still in single digits as
far as goals go. The point is that

the most productive people on
the team are big men. The only
reason the small guys like Brown
and Quinn have some goals is

because they are, of course, part

of the offense. But playingthe
law of averages by having small
guys on the ice and knowing
they will score eventually is not
enough for a successful team. It

"i51zzA OUTLET I

must have big guys who can play
man to man and physically beat
their opponents with strength
instead of trying to skate around

them and trying to finagle their ‘

way into a position to score.

The Penguins are a very -

talented team in terms of skill.
They are just too small to be a big
success in the NHL.
