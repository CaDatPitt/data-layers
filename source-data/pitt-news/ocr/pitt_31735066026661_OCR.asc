Speaker stresses value of future

By Linda Wisniewski
Staff Writer

With an introduction of poetry readings and
drum solos reflecting African culture, Dr.

‘Na’im Akbar spoke to a packed Ballroom in

the William Pitt Union last night.

The lecture was in celebration of Black
History Month, and was sponsored by the
Black Action Society.

“This black history celebration is not only
an opportunity for us to celebrate our her-
itage, but most importantly, it’s a challenge
for us to begin to prepare our future,” said
Akbar.

Akbar is one of the most renowned African-
American psychologists in the world, accord-
ing to Rinaldo Washington, chair of the Black
Action Society. He has written five books as

Akbar teaches in the department of psy-
chology at Florida State University and is
also the director of his own private consulting
firm — Mind Productions and Associates.

He said Black History Month should serve
as a catalyst, not to necessarily remind
African Americans what has been done, but
rather to inspire them as to what should be
done to make the future brighter for them.

“The challenge for us at this time is to
begin to take account of where we are, and to
be very clear that unless we define and struc-
ture our future, there will be no future,” said
Akbar.

He said he came to speak on how to heal

the black mind in order to reinstate the mental

health of the African people.
He said African—American people are still
suffering from the fear and intimidation their

Oh, I'll get around to it sooner or later ..

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

Although you are probably reading
this newspaper article right now
because you are procrastinating, keep
reading. After you are done, you might
actually know why you procrastinate.

According to the “American College
Dictionary,” procrastination means “to
defer action; to delay or put off a neces-
sary task until another day or time.”

In a study published in “The Journal

of General Psychology,” it was found -

that over 70 percent of all college stu-
dents tested do procrastinate in one way
or another. The same study found that
over 80 percent of those students report-
ed that procrastination resulted in high-
er feelings of stress, and poorer results

on their school work and social lives.

A good majority of college students
have admitted to procrastinating, and a
high percentage of those students admit-’
ted that by procrastinating they made
life hard on themselves in the long run.
The question still looms: Why do stu-
dents procrastinate?‘

“It’s easier to blow it off then to sit
down and actually do it,” said Pitt stu-
dent Phil Santos. “I know the sooner
you start it the sooner you get it done.
but I don’t tend to do that.”

According to Barbara Suddarth, an
intern at the counseling center and co-
leader of the Procrastination Workshop
held at Pitt, pain is a big reason for pro-'
crastination.

Fears of success, failure or the size of
the project contributes to the perceived

boredom or monotony of the activity,
which leads to procrastination.

“I normally play ‘the guitar, or go‘ out
with my friends or watch TV when I
procrastinate,” said Santos. “I’ll even
wash the dishes to procrastinate. If I
could change and get myself to start
earlier, I would.”

While some Pitt students find their
apartments or dorm rooms cleanest
around midterms or finals, others have
found much" bigger and better procrasti-
nation procedures.

Take junior Nate Feduska, who decid— 

ed one evening to pull an all-nighter.

He and his friends piled into a car and
drove all night to Chicago, took a tour
of the Sears Tower and stayed to catch a
Cubs-Marlins baseball game, instead of

WASHINGTON — The
Washington Post reported
this week that CIA turncoat,
Aldrich Ames, has not told
investigators all that he
knows about the circum-
stances surrounding his spy-
ing for Moscow.

Apparently, Ames has
failed several lie detector
tests on questions concern-
ing whether or not he has
told them all the informa-
tion that he gave to
Moscow. He also failed
questions concerning when
and how he began spying
for Moscow. 1

Ames, who worked for the
CIA for 31 years, was
arrested last year along with
his wife and was charged
with conspiracy to commit
espionage and tax fraud. He

In past columns, we’ve
talked about today’s changing
employment market, and what
skills you need to master in
order to be successful in your
job search. Today we’ll focus
on exploring two different and
creative sources of potential
employment.

Let’s start with temp agen-
cies. The temporary employ-
ment industry has changed

gramming to administrative
positions. Jobs can range in
duration from a month to a
year or more, depending on
the client company’s needs.
With all of the different types
of clients that temp agencies
work with, it makes sense that
their most ‘marketable’ appli-
cants will be those with a lot
of strong skills. Computer
expertise is always in demand.
Even liberal arts grads should
look for opportunities to mas-
ter word processing and
spreadsheet software before
graduation. Another key com-
ponent is versatility. Having a

other organizations hire both
technical and non-technical
personnel. While some of
these employers may not offer
you all of the perks of their
private sector counterparts,
they often compensate by pro-
viding a work environment
that encourages new ideas and
rewards increased responsibil-
ity.

What does it take to sue-
ceed with a non_-profit
employer? Dedication, for
one. These organizations are
quite often associated with
promoting a particular social
or political agenda or issue. If

Temporary employment agen-
cies can provide the jobseeker
with an opportunity to gain
experience in a wide variety
of different settings. It also
gives companies an opportu-
nity to ‘preview’ employees,
with the possibility of offering
permanent employment later
on.

Temp agencies cater to a
wide range of employment
needs, from computer pro-

knack for handling different
tasks, adapting _to changing
environments and learning
new skills quickly will help
you tremendously as a temp.
As college students, many of
you already do these things on
a regular basis. Just make sure
that your resume markets your

Another valuable but often

writing a paper that was due.

While some Pitt students
travel eight hours by car to
partake in procrastination,
some go no further than
across campus.

Pitt student Elysium
Drumm, a transfer student
from East New Mexico
University, went with a
bunch of friends to a foun-
tain on campus, filled it with
dye and bubble bath and
waded in it for a few hours
as a stress reliever She had
three finals the next day.

Understanding why we
procrastinate is a powerful
first step in tackling it,
Suddarth said.

A typical avoidance pat-
tern, said Suddarth, is as fol-
lows:

-Recognition of a task that
needs to be done

°Focus on the pain of the
task

°Convince yourself that it
really. doesn’t have to be
done today

-Breath deep and resign
yourself not to do it now

According to Suddarth,
students will do anything to
procrastinate, including raid-
ing the refrigerator, cleaning
the refrigerator, watching
T.V.,’reading magazines and
novels, going to the movies
and cleaning their rooms,
just to name a few.

The following are nine
proven techniques for over-
coming procrastination,
according to Suddarth: ‘

-Break large tasks into
smaller chunks which will
not create anxiety

°Set deadlines and stick to
them. Put your deadlines in a
public place (like on your
refrigerator)

-Share your goals with a
friend who will agree to help
you stick with them

°Reward yourself when 4

completing a task _

-Utilize a creative sched-
ule to do awful tasks when
you have the most energy

-Make a game out of the
task

-Focus on the benefits of
the task

°Use a leading task to get
things started, not a whole
picture

Just do it! Drop every-
thing and do it!!

Now that you know why
you procrastinate, and you
know what to do to slow
down or stop procrastinat-
ing, put this knowledge to
use. Put The Pitt News away,
and when you finish that
task, reward yourself by

°From page 1
Because this year’s event is
open to all students, the winners
will comprise three categories: a
Greek winner, an independent

' winner (this category is for the

majority of the student popula-
tion) and an organization winner
(category for campus groups). _

“I really want to emphasize this
is a non-Greek event,” said
Reddy. “The charity of Family
House plays an important role in
the community and it’s worth
coming out for.f’

Located in Pittsburgh’s
Oakland section, Family House
opened in 1983 at 233 McKee
Place. The mission was started to
provide housing for short-term
patients and their families. The
success- of Family House has
been enormous, serving 16,000
guests from nearly all 50 states
and many foreign countries. _

Theobject of the marathon is

to gain as many pledges as possi— .

ble and raise the most amount of
money. For instance, if mom and
dad sponsor their son for $10 per
hour, he has $240 dollars. The
main idea is to go outside and get
businesses to sponsor dancers
with corporate bucks.

_ Another popular way of solicit-
ing public money is canning.
Students willing to venture into
the streets can raise a substantial
amount of cash for the marathon.

The official canning date has
been set for Friday, March 17,
and students are- permitted to can
downtown this year.

As for the marathon itself,
dancers must move at all" times;
simply shifting weight from one
foot to the other is acceptable.
Games and other activities will
be provided to ensure movement
at all times. Points will be given
to each individual and group to
detennine a winner at the end of
the marathon.

A fund-raising concert will be
held this ‘Friday, Feb. 25," at‘The
Attic. There is a cover of $3, and
all performance proceeds go to

Education instead of labor

The first national survey of training, hiring and management
practices in America brings out the cruel truth that employers
think 20% of American workers are not up to the task of their
jobs. This study was conducted by the Census Bureau for the
Department of Education. Congress’ panacea for this decline
in American education: eliminate the Department of
Education. 7

Once again, it would be best for this country to have a
breach of contract. At a time when the country is lagging
behind, eliminating the Department of Education is the most
self-defeating thing this country can do. While it may look
good for balancing the budget and helping the GOP election
bid in the short term, a move to eliminate the’ Department of
Education means relegating the American people into a.sec-
ond-class position in the world.

According to The New York Times, employers are no longer
hiring students right out of college and putting them into jobs.
They are training their own employees and looking for private
suppliers and consulting firms instead of universities.

In response to the declining quality of education, employers
are now looking for different things in their recruits besides
their grades. According to USAT0day, employers now look at
such things as attitude, communication skills, work experience
and. recommendations from previous employers. At the bottom
of employers’ list of criteria is-academic performance, reputa-
tion of schools attended and recommendations from teachers.

So, as opposed to eliminating the Department of Education,
it should be expanded and its power should be increased. Right
now, it has the smallest staff of any federal department —
5,000, as opposed to 800,000 civilian employees in the

' Department of Defense. The Cold War ended years ago, but

the peace dividend has not materialized.

As Secretary of Labor Robert Reich pointed out in his book
The Work of Nations: “each nation’s primary assets will be its
citizens’ skills and insights.” The Republicans would rather

see the Department of Education go under the Department of

Labor. The entire country will soon be under the Department
of Manual Labor for foreign firms, if the current trend contin-
ues. I

Now is a critical time in our nation’s history. We can either
educate our young people and continue to raise the standard of
living by raising the abilities of the population, or we can
allow the current decline in the American way of life by can-
celing a department which is the most important for this coun-
try’s future. . -

By using the Department of Education to make substantial
changes in_ the way our country educates its citizens, we can
again rise to the international promise that was ours in the
past. Students should make a stand for their rights and the
future of this country by making their voices heard in
Washington. The easiest way is to write to their elected offi-
cials.

Sociel)/'5 p

n response t
Iesteemed colleague’s not-

so impressive column
published Tuesday last, I»feel
a need not only to thank her
for ending my subject-
drought, but also for adding
yet another wall in the
already over—divided psyche
of society.

That was a rather long sen-
tence, but I’m better now,
thank you.

As for the overwhelming
differences outlined in Erika
Kendra’s column concerning
the “gender roles,” I have
only this to say: Who
CARES!?! It makes me
cringe (and nearly vomit) to

know that people (and that, ‘

my reader, is the fundamen-
tal element here — people),
still harbor under age—old
ideals of anatomical differ-
ences which even, the sim-

' plest of organisms can note.

The real issue at hand is not
the differences, but the over-
whelming similarities (i.e.,
the simple fact that we’re all
HUMAN). I cannot think of
a better unifier than that.
After everything that both
sexes have done to reach a
common ground (and yes,
still reaching), I am appalled
that people are nit-picking
about who is more qualified
for what job, blah blah blah.
Please, the information used

syche is over-divided

in the column is not only
biased (truly, how can chil-
dren be raised gender-free?
This is an idyllic impossibil-
ity, and one that can never be
impartially tested. I don’t
care if it’s ABC, NBC, the
CIA or XYZ.), but as previ-
ously noted, impossible to
test. The fact of the matter is

that we have these roles’,

SOCIETY ’ has created,
please, and must either live
with them (as the 1950s did),
destroy them (as the 1960s
attempted to do) or compro-
mise (as we are now trying
to do. By compromise, I sim-
ply mean reach common
ground and accept one
another as human persons).
Or, ignore it (as disco
attempted to do, but we
won’t delve into that better-
left—unchartered ground).

_ Perhaps my fellow colum-
nist should adhere to the
words of Emily Dickinson:
“It’s such a little thing to
weep, so short a thing to
sigh; And yet by trades the
size of these, we men and
women die!” We are con-
nected in ways we probably
will never understand. I
maintain the "differences you
claimed so fundamental are
nothing but trivial observa-
tions that a two-year—old
could make. It is this mind-
set that makes matters worse

for everyone — everyone,
men, women, human beings.

“We men and women die,”
said Miss Dickinson. And
this fact is no less trivial
than those pointed out in the
aforementioned column. It is
a fact as fundamental as the
little one that we’re all in
this together man,
woman, African—American,
Asian-American, Caucasian,
Hispanic, Canadian, etc., etc.

It may seem that I have
eva'ded the point Miss
Kendra was making. I am
not ignorant to her thesis, I
simply think it’s a pointless
one. What’s more, she was
overlooking something that
is all-too-often overlooked. I
felt a need as a human being
to clear this matter up.

I also felt a need to thank
all those with whom I delib-
erated about these matters
(you know who you are),
especially my Roy Rogefs
Friends. You all inspired me
to shoot my mouth off. An
inspiration which may prove
ill, given the mind-set of so
many people (a fact they
often forget).

By the way, I think it’s
necessary forthe SGB to
offer a Gary Larson support
group. Please take this into
consideration. Thank you. .

No. 7 team
should be

no more in

college hoops

Columnist» T
Ed curse
Ziegenfuss ‘ has

been set.
Set by some evil being who
wants to see a long shot win
it all. This curse is the
upset epidemic running
,, rampant throughout colle-

giate basketball.

It seems that every time a
team ascends to the No. 1
ranking, they lose their next
game. Even the best teams
in the nation have suc-
cumbed to this curse. The
victims list reads like a
who’s who of college

. hoops. .

Arkansas was the first top
team to fall from the perch.
The University of
Massachusetts, North
Carolina, UConn and
Kansas have all fallen
since. Kansas was the latest
victim, losing on Monday
night to Oklahoma 76-73.

This curse has been a
tough one to figure out.
One game a team can come
out and look unbeatable and
the next game they come
out and play so badly that
the Washington Generals
could manhandle them.

One example of this is
UConn. The Huskies tore
through the Big East, beat-
ing up everyone in their
path until they met
Villanova. The game was
played at UConn, which
usually means a big advan-
tage in the Big East. But
this time the home Huskies
got spanked by 23 points.
Then Villanova traveled to
Georgetown and lost a
game they should have
won. You figure it out.

The only things that I do
know are that first, the polls
should be abolished, and
second, March Madness
this year will be madder
than ever.

On my first point, the
polls that rank the college
basketball teams are use-
less. The only time that the
rankings mean anything is
on the Tuesday morning
following the National
Championship game. The
NCAA used its head, only
once, and came up with the
tournament to settle the bat
tle for No. 1. Wow, I won-
der why another brainstorm
cannot be thought of for
football, but that is another
story.

Secondly, we are roughly

Pitt sputters in first alf, Ises  

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor

The worst thing that
could have happened to the
streaking Panthers was to
run into an angry Syracuse
Orangemen squad.

Fresh off three straight
losses, No. 17 Syracuse
came out hungry to prove a

point, and

Orangemen

‘Pitt 85-72
last night in front of 27,473
Carrier Dome fans.

“We tried to warn the kids
that we’re coming into an
arena that’s tough to play in
because they need a win,”
Pitt coach Ralph Willard
said in a post-game inter-
view. “They beat us in
every phase of the game.
We have trouble with phys-
ical teams and we played
timid.” I

The Panthers, who came
into the game riding a two-
game winning streak, ran
into an orange wall early.

Leading 6-5, Syracuse
went on a quick eight-point
run. Then ‘Cuse center
John Wallace went berserk
down low. He scored 14 of
Syracuse’s next 18 points
within a seven-minute span.
In that span, Pitt could only
muster five points, as the
Orangemen opened a 26-10

But just as quick as
Wallace ran ramped, he was
sidelined with three fouls
within 25 seconds; but not
before he went six-for-six
in the first half, as he

scored a team-high 20
points for the game.

Things got worse for Pitt
when Wallace went to the
bench. After a Lucious
Jackson tip at the 7:30
mark, Pitt was down a cool

Pitt tried to cut the lead
under 20 before the close of
the half, but Lawrence
Moten’s fade-away three-
pointer in the waning
moments stretched the lead
to 45-24.

The Orangemen simply
couldn’t miss in the first
stanza, as they shot an
astounding 71 percent (20-
for-28).

“When you don’t contest
shots, that’s going to hap-
pen,” Willard said.
“They’re not going to miss
l5—footers with no one in
their face.”

Shortly into the second
frame, Moten buried an
NBA—range three-pointer to
extend Syracuse’s bulge to
24 — 52-28. Moten, who
scored a quiet 19 points,
recently took over Seton
Hall’s Terry Dehere’s Big
East all-time scoring
record.

At around the 15-minute
mark, freshman Todd
Burgan nailed a three to
extend the Orangemen lead
to the largest of the game,
29 points.

But just as Syracuse put
the game into cruise con-
trol, Pitt fought back. Point
guard Andre Alridge
answered Burgan’s three-
pointer with one of his
own, and then Jaime
Peterson scrapped for a

Fletcher Iecicls track team to five first-place finishes

By Diavail Smith
Staff Writer

“The men’s and women’s
track teamhad five first-
place finishes, and Najuma
Fletcher owned four of
those victories as she cap-
tured the women’s out-
standing field events per-
former at the Big East
Indoor Championships last
weekend at the Carrier
Dome in Syracuse.

“That was the best perfor-
mance I’ve ever seen. I
would even go so far to say
that she is the best female
collegiate athlete in the

nation," coach Steve Lewis

said.

Fletcher, who still has
another year to beat up on
the conference, became the
Big East Champion in four
different events. She won
the pentathlon, which con-
sists the 55-meter hurdles,
high jump, shotput, long
jump and the 800-meter
run, scoring 4,295 points in
the event. In the process of
beating the closest competi-
tor by 205 points, she set a
Big East Championship
‘record and also a Carrier
Dome record.-

“The Pentathlon was my
main goal, because it was
the hardest,” Fletcher said.
“The other was to place as
high as I could in the other
events.” A

And she did ‘just that, set-
ting another Big East record
in the long jump (20-9 1/4).

Fletcher wasn’t done yet.”

She also set a Big East
record in the triple jump
with a jump measuring 42-6

landed a fourth-place finish
in the race (7.99 seconds).
Speaking of best times,
Angie Martin hit her best
time of the season in the
800-meter run with atime
of 2:08.72 seconds to take
second place. _
The tag team of Joetta
Purter, Angela Martin, Ayne
Allen and Tonya Mullins
held their own with a third-
place finish in the.4 x 400

 

1/4.

She didn’t ‘set a record in
the high jump, but Fletcher
won the event with a leap
of 5-9 1/4

Fourth-year sprinter
Stacey Suggs did some
damage by hitting her best
time of the season in the
55-meter hurdles to finish
second with a time of 7.88
seconds. And Najuma
Fletcher didn’t wantto be
left out of the fun, as she

relay ‘race (3:44.44).
The defending champion

women’s team took third '

overall behind champion
Georgetown and runner-up
Villanova.

For the men, third-year
man Curtis ‘Anderson was
the Panthers’ other winner,
taking the pentathlon with
3793 points. He also took
time out of his busy sched-
ule to compete in the triple
jump and earn a fourth

place finish with a jump of
47 feet, 9 inches.

But with all of that suc-
cess, coach Lewis sees no
end. _

‘‘We’re still moving for-
ward, there’s more to
come,” coach Lewis said.

If that’s the case someone
had better tell Dietrich Jells
to save something for later,
as he finished in second
place in two events. Jells
took second in the 200-
meter dash as he almost hit
his best time of the season
with a time of 21.44 sec-
onds. But his work day
wasn’t finished as he also
took second in the 55-meter
dash (6.31). Teammates
Anthony Dorsett and Jay
Jones took third and fourth
place respectively in the
same event.

Third—year sprinter Jay
Murphy did some work in
the‘ 55-meter hurdles, hit-
ting a time of 7.43 seconds
to take third in the event.

The men finished fifth
overall in the team competi-
tion.

Besides the five first-
place finishes, the’Panthers
also had five second-place

finishes and four third-
place finishes.

There were also six
National Collegiate
Athletic Associati
on Championship quali-
fiers, three meet records
set, five school records
and 18 personal records
set.

“We had a great meet in
the toughest conference,”
coach Lewis said. V

What’s next for the
Panthers?

“The competition will

get even better. It goes on L

and on,” coach Lewis
said.

The Panthers next test
will be at the
Mobile Invitational at
Notre Dame.

the ever—present
curse hanging over col-
lege hoopdom, this year
could be the year that a
No. 16 seed finally upsets .
the No. 1 seed. That
should throw all of the
polls and gambling

- bets for areal loop.

So there is hope out
there for teams like Rider,
Boise State, Bowling
Green and Tulsa who are
usually first round door—.
mats for the big names.
Mark my words —— this
will be the year that a team
that nobody expects to win
will win it all. Remember
the curse.

conversion, Gant sealed a
pair of free throws off yet
another steal to close the
lead to 64-50.

Soon after, Moten split a
pair of free throws, signify-
ing the first time Syracuse
scored in over three min-
utes.

Pitt’s late second-half
surge was led by power for-
ward Chris Gant, who
scored 14 of his 16 points
in the later frame.

“He really picked it up in

the second half,” Willard
said of Gant after he came
out lethargic in the first
half. «
The Panthers exchanged
hoops and turnovers with
Syracuse for about-three
minutes, until Orlando
Antigua (15 points) hit both
free throws. Pitt’s next pos-
session Peterson tipped in a
missed shot to slice the
lead to 12 with 3:45
remaining. '

Finally, after several
futile attempts, Antigua’s
three—pointer cut the lead to
single digits, 73-64.

But Moten quickly retali-
ated with a hoop and a foul.
After that, it was a fouling
fest, as the score see-sawed
from nine to 13 points.

Transfer point guard
Michael LLoyd solidified
the Syracuse win by bury-
ing six of six free throws
down the stretch.

The Panthers outscored
‘Cuse 48-40 in the second
frame, but it was too late.

“I told the kids, why
compete like thatin the
second half when you
buried yourself in the
first,” Willard said. ’

“Give them credit,
though, Syracuse came out
ready. They’re definitely a
top 20 team.”

The Panthers dropped to
7-16 and 3-12 in the Big
East. Syracuse raised its
record to 18-6 and- 11-4 in.

ancestors suffered as slaves
when they were brought from
Africa in cargo ships, and
were beaten, whipped and
publicly lynched for more
than three centuries.

“The intention was that we
were never supposed to be
anything but slaves,” he said.

He said that slavery turned 0

African Americans against
themselves. He said it took
away and distorted their sani-
ty to where now they do not
even know who they are any-
more.

“That’s the kind of fear .

that was built into us,” said
Akbar. “That’s why today
even when we become most
brutal, we don’t attack white
folk, we attack black folk.”

He said even to this day
African American’s are
afraid of white people, and
he thinks it is time that this
changed.

“Black folks are beginning

to wake up in spite of every-
thing,” he said. ‘‘If they
white, they racist.”

“We’ve got to begin to
declare love on each other,”
he said. “We must begin to
actively love ourselves.”

He said that the African
Americans here at Pitt should
not rely on anyone but them-
selves to build a cultural cen-
ter for their activities.

“If you’re a student here,
don’t expect this school to
give you what you need,’
