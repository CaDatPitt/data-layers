Progressive Movements
On The Wane As 1937-
38 Session Begins . . .

See Editorial, Obit for Pitt Co- E

op, Page 2. :

The campus l'1'oe1~al is deadli

Either killed by drought or
choked by sumnier dust storms,
the demise of the campus prog-
ressive is now almost officially
recognized by this coronc1"s
jury of one.

Latest episode is a persistent ru-
mor that the Pitt Co-operative
Club, ﬁnally recognized on cam-
pus last year, after constant post-
ponement in presentment to SFA,
will not continue it’s program this
fall. ,

At last year’s end plans includ- 9
ed the increasing development of
the club to a position held by Co-
ops in other universities, notably
Harvard and Texas.

The Pitt organization which had
between 75 and 100 ﬁnancially in-
terested members last June was to
have widened its scope this fall to
include a bookstore for new and
used texts at practically wholesale
prices, gasoline cost reduction for
members, and a closer contact
with community merchants.

Leaders Lose Interest . . .

Leaders of the movement ap-
parently lost interest over the
summer or decided to abandon
plans especially for the book-
store which was to have opened
sometime during registration.

Credit promised by a downtown
company has not been tapped.
Students are purchasing books at
the old rates, from the usual chan-
nels. Even officers of the club
can give no deﬁnite information
of its existence.

Predictions call for its ﬁnal dis-
solution after sporadic attempts
at revival late this semester, al-
though its temporary charter,
based upon the club’s constitution,
expires next spring.

The story of the Pitt Co-op re-
calls formation of a Pitt chapter
of the American Student Union.
Never officially recognized as a
campus organization by SFA,
Pitt’s ASU chapter had an ane-
mic life, lingering death. Many
of its leading members have left
campus, their disciples scattered.

Students of these developments
have long predicted a short and
uneventful. life if such an organi-
zation is officially recognized, a
tho_gn to_those who oppose legal
recognitiorl. Thecase of_the Co;
op proves the_ point, althbugh
here, general _ lack of interest
among theyotficers is dealing the
body blow.  _ .

To Be Topic
At Inquiry

Lyman Hoover
To Discuss
China, Japan

China ’s side of her
clared war with Japan will be
explained to students Friday at
Inquiry Forum ’s opening meet-

Men of the freslnn-.111 class will have their first official meet-'
ing with student activities tonight at 8:15 o’clock at the Logan
Armory, when the annual Druid Smoker begins.

‘I Freshmen have the opportunity

unde-

ing of the year, to be held at

12 :30 o’clock in 8 Cathedral.

The speaker, Lyman Hoover,
former student-secretary of the
Peiping YMCA, has held this post
in China for seven years, and has
been in close contact with the peo-
ple who today are battling the
Japanese invaders.

RECEIVES NEW POST
Recently assigned to a new po-
sition in Shanghai, Mr. Hoover
has been unable to return to China
because of the present ﬁghting.
He was on a short furlough in

America when hostilities broke
out.
Mr. Hoover directed student

groups in Peiping. His interests
with the business and professional
men in Peiping have given him an
excellent background knowledge
of the present conflict.

Inquiry Forum, sponsored by
the YlVl-YWCA, meets regularly
every Monday, with Friday’s spe-
cial session opening the series. Co-
chairmen are JQhn_j._Martinco, C39,
and Ida Gigliotti, C39.

 

Ilowdy Hop "
Today ..

Beginning  the ‘tea-dance sea-
son will be observed this after-
noon, when College Association
stages its annual get-together af-

no attempts have been made to in-
clude it in the college catalogue.

The ﬁght to include a course in
sex education will probably be
carried on in SFA this year. With
the campaigns to educate the gen-
eral public for the need of such
courses, _/the local campaign may
still be won.

Another inglorious retreat for
the liberal movement was the en-
couraging start, but early falter-
ing of Pitt Peace Council last year.
While national members of the
emergency peace campaign did
succeed in arousing some interest
on campus, the movement was
short-lived, degenerated greatly
by last term’s end. _

Restoratives and black coffee
are in order. ‘But the great Pitt
liberal, who caused so many in-
teresting intellectual although
sometimes bickering debates, is
dead!

 

Caputo Accepts
New Position

Frank R. Caputo, graduate as-
sistant in ‘the. history department
for the past two .years, who had

versity Club ballroom.

Dancing will begin at 2:30
o'clock to the tunes of Bob Sar-
raf and his orchestra, and will
continue ..un_t.il _ .5230. Admission
will be 25 cents per person.

One of the highlights of the af-
ternoon’s program will come with
the announcement of the names of
the new CA social chairman and
cabinet members, according to
Ted Whitaker, C38, president of
the organization, which includes
all students of the College.

A main objective of this after-
noon’s affair, declares Whitaker,
is to provide freshmen an oppor-
tunity to become acquainted with
other members of the class of '41
as well as with upperclassmen,
and for upperclassmen to renew
old friendships.

Another objective will be the
swelling of the Student Loan
Fund, a project sponsored by CA.
All the dance proceeds will go
into the fund.

Dr. Hutchisson

Dr. Elmer Hutchisson, professor
of physics, has been appointed act-
ing head of the department of
physics for the coming year, Dr.

With the demand for books far
exceeding the supply, Men’s Cour;-.
cil’s book exchange begins its
third day__g£ trading this mornmg‘.

“Our business would --be twice
as great if we had no books we
needed. surely some of the stu-
dents have old texts they have no
use for and would like to sell”
said slbhn Glasser, BA38, presi-
dttht of the Council. “We ﬁnd that
we are especially short of engi-
neering and English books.”

Any student bringing in a book
may set his own price if he wish-
es. He will receive a receipt and,
when’ the book is sold, will be no-
tiﬁed and paid immediately.

The exchange is open daily from

Plans for a series of six de-
bates with a Western Reserve Uni-
versity team before high schools
of Pennsylvania and Ohio during
late October and early November
will be discussed at the meeting
of the Men’s Debating Associa-
tion in 2017 Cathedral during the
fifth hour today.

The trip is one of the many sug-
gestions to be placed before the
group today by Coach C. W. Lo-
mas, instructor in English, and
William Stark, C38, manager of
the association.

Besides the trip, the organiza-
tion plans call for a reception com-
mittee to entertain visiting teams,
and an audience committee, which
will contact various audiences and
attempt to establish a more regu-
lar schedule.

All of which, Stark hopes, will
insure greater participation in de-
bating by the student body.

He reports that the subject for
the competition with the Western
Reserve team will concern the
value of the unicameral legisla-
ture. Only six men will comprise
the debate teams.

Coach Lomas and Stark invite
all upperclass candidates to at-
tend t0day’s meeting.

YMCA Holds

For Research

A fund of $50,000 has been
granted the University School of

a weapon against disease, accord-
ing to an announcement made to-
day.

The donor is the Westinghouse
Electric and Manufacturing, Com-
pany. Although the concern will
not‘ participate directly in the re-
search work, it will make the re-
sults available to_ all medical au-
thorities as a contribution to pub-

9 The Lantern Night ceremony, a

4tradition among women on cam-
Ipus, formally initiates the fresh-
,man class into life at the Univer-

lsity. Its ritual centers around the

gift of light symbolizing the wis-
dom and knowledge which the
~University fosters.

While the University Band is
playing, the freshman women,
dressed in white’, will assemble
with their mentors on the lawn
between Thaw and State Halls.
Marie Powell, C39, chairman of
the WSGA traditions committee,
will make the introductory speech
to explain the purpose and mean-
ing of the ceremony.

PROMETHEAN LIGHT

In the opening scene, Prome-
theus, who gave~th'e"glft" ofﬁre to
man, visits the University as a re-
sult of his conversation with the
Scholar. There he finds Father
Pitt guarding the gates of knowl-
edge. Learning that it is the
Promethean light whichthe fresh-
men are seeking, Father Pitt opens
the gates and summons the ﬂame-
bearers to enter.

From their candles, kindled at
the gift of fire, the freshman wom-
en light their lanterns and follow
Father Pitt as he leads them up
the campus drive to Heinz House,
where the final scene of the cere-
mony is presented. There the
freshmen pledge allegiance to
Alma Mater. who sends them forth
“to kindle to a burning ﬂame the
Promethean spark they bear.’’»

HE l’I'l."‘ i\7E\V'S received two “Letters to
the Editor " Monday !

That both letters are about the same thing,
and that tliing, a pseiido-campus publication,
is of no pa.rticular nioiiient.

Editors of The Pitt News, and previous ed-
itors of The Pitt \‘\7eekly, have always :'ittenipt-
-ed to start a “Letters" column in some iorni
or otlicr. Either Uiiiversit_v students were I00
tired after writing class themes, or they just
didii’t care, for no “Letters” column ever
lasted.

And so, we were surprised when we. receiv-
-ed two letters hfoiiclay, the first day of classes,
"before" our “please write letters to us” cam-
paign even started.

' T-lie column will appear as often as letters

arewr-ittcn. Any letter which runs over 150

words, or is unsigned, or both, will betossed

into. the wastebasket. Any letter which runs

I50-words or under, is signed and is addressed

to “'\Vell———.'lf Think.” the-column title, will be

~p_i.-inted by The Pitt News.

"lJ€‘ll(*.I'S will be printed with the writer’s
name in full unless a special request for initials
only isincluded i-ii the letter.

Class Notes For Sale

A student at U. C. L‘. A. exhibits what some
may consider eﬁrontery plus, writing a letter
defending the outright purchase of class notes
after an irate professor has fumed in public
over the practice.
' The studeiit’s thesis seems to be that intelligent
labor-saving is not lazy, dishonest or “cheap.”

By Jean. Barnes

Well,” said the professor, “life should once more
be a thing‘ of peace and beauty. Registration is
ﬁnished, the Marine Band has come and gone, and
soon the World Series will be over.”
“Um-hum,” said Mabel, twisting a thread around
a button. , " ,

“Yes, life should be all peace and beauty,” said
the professor, “but one would never know it to-
look at the papers. I see by tonight’s paper that
the Americaii.Legioii has pledged itself to world
peace-—-making the World War Armistice and the
Constitution the only two pieces of paper in the
world that are sacredand eternal. New York, in‘
the meantime, boards up its windows against the
coming Legion convention.

“Next to the Legion peace story, I notice that the
United States is;.goin_g,to sit in judgment on Japan,
joining the.League of Nations (which we once roy-
ally snubbed) to investigate the Sino-Japanese war.
Two things, I think, stand in the way of this.

He paused to light his pipe.

“In the ﬁrst place,” he went on, “we haven’t said
it was a war. In the second place, we’d be placing
ourselves in the extremely embarrassing position of
examining our own steel merchatits and oil barons,
who have their ﬁngers in the international pie.”
“Um-hum,” said Mabel, hunting in the basket for
another button.

“I notice also, that Mr. Roosevelt refuses to com-
ment on the Black-Klan issue until Hugo returns
to America, which he is doing at the moment.
“When he arrives here, however, Mr. Roosevelt
may be on his way west, accomplishing two pur-
poses. He is attonce puigingthe Democratic party
of undesirablessenators, and making it impossi-blc
to comment on Black vs. Supreme Court.-”

   

they were foursquare behind Mr. Roosevelt, which,
as I see it, places Mr. Roosevelt foursquare behind
he eight-ball.”

He paused again and re—lit his pipe.

“While all this is going on, the Duke and Duchess
of Windsor are considering making their home in
America. On the eve of such. a ne.ws-gatheririg-
event, Walter Winchell -goes away for a rest.”
“That's too bad,” said Mabel, rocking-away.

“It certainly is. But this ought to bringthe shine
back to your eyes, Mabel. Eleanor Holm is-going
to play the part of Tarzan’s mate -in the -cinema.”
“Isn’t she the one who drinks. or something?”
asked Mabel. ,

“I believe she also swims, a little, Mabel. But
to get back to the news. It looks as though we'are
to have no peace at all. The newspapers are full
ofiall sorts of upsetting headlines and stories.” He
rattled the papers.

“Ah!” he exclaimed. “But here is something that
brings one ray of light. A man named Lucien
Lelong has brought out a new. perfume, and with
the purchase of each twenty-ﬁve dollar bottle, he
gives the buyer his autograph. Well, I always
knew that every cloud had to have a silver lining.”
“Excuse me,” said Mabel, “I forgot to water the
rubber-plant.”

Lewis lost the strike, but learned
important lessons.

For, inspired by previous suc-

themselves invincible, an irresist-
ible force destined to embrace
every American worker. Such a

But now that C.I.O. has learned

extremely unfortunate for the

The editors fail to include their

any part in putting out as good
a job as this Index I should want
my name plastered all over it.

Though I disagreediwith sever-
al of the opinions written, on the
whole, they were as nearly right
as could be. I was glad to see
that they did not stoop to slap-
stick, and that at no time did
they become vituperative or give
the impression of having an axe
to grind.

In addition, the Index was of
great help to many students in
registering for doubtful courses.

Congratulations to the editors

hoping that the next one’s as good.

‘Vade Mecum’
Appears After Lapse
Of Two Years

“Vade Marcum” has returned to

Freshman Handbook the last two
_years which was issued to both
.men and women students at the
University, the women’s handbook
is this year issued as a separate
‘publication.

Editor of the women’s edition, is
Jean Barnes, C38. Miss Barnes,
‘together with her assistants, Dor-
othy Davis, C39, and Jeanne Low-
ry, C40, delved deeply into ﬁles
and history to emerge with com-
prehensive accounts of traditions,
customs, publications, musical or-
ganizations, school associations,
and forensic groups.

There is a special section treat-
ing, of senior mentors, customs
committee, units, and general in-
formation that is necessary to the
"freshman.

Introducing one of the sections
.is a message by Miss Thyrsa W.
Amos, dean of women. Then fol-
lows a. history of. women of the
University. Following a calendar
of events for therensuing semester
is a section of the University songs
and cheers.

Recreation on board consisted-
of bull sessions, quoits, weight-
lifting contests, bridge and ﬁsh-
ing.

Seventeen days after leaving
the Panama Canal, they clocked
at Honolulu where they spent two
weeks. Vacationing on the island
at the time were Shirley Temple,
Gene Raymond and wife Jeanette 3
MacDonald, and Mary Pickford
and husband Buddy Rogers, who’.
were staying at the Royal Hawai- ‘
ian hotel.

They visited the only active vol-
cano, Mauna, Loa, and Mauna
Kea, which is now extinct. An-'
other spot of interest was the
Hawaiian National Park, where
wild boar hunting is the favorite.
sport.

Another favorite pastime of the
Hawaiians is tea-leafriding. They
sit on th.ese leaves, about-the size
of banana leaves, and slide down
a mud track. The sport is dan-
gerous inasmuch as it is just as
fast’ as tobogganing. Spills are
numerous.

The hula—hula girls of travel
folder fame are a myth, Griffith
and McKenna claim. The only
time they saw any was when the
hotel put on an exhibition for the
"tourists.

The cruise, which took two

boys back in time to registerfor

take too much encouragement for
them to bare their chests and
arms to show you how brown they
got.

Her. name was Joyce and she
must have been a freshman. We
got only a glance at her stack of
registration cards and we’re pretty
sure about that last ‘name.

She came into the Commons
Room with the bearing of a
hostess entering a reception room,
except that she was preceded by
a tremendous animal, known
familiarly as a Great Dane. By
mutual agreement they, the girl
and the dog had come to registra-
tion together.

Since no clause has ever been
entered in University laws and
by-laws providing for such a con- I,
dition, their progress through the
multitudinous stages of registra-
tion was undisturbed. That is, it

was undisturbed until the dog saw
a potential enemy. ‘
Short, stocky Dan Lichtenstein,

Dr. Carroll Daugherty, professor
of economics, summarized recent
union activities and pointed out
the relations between employer
and employee to members of the
National Industrial Stores associ-
ation at their convention Monday
at the VVilliam Penn hotel.

Dr. Daugherty emphasized the
necessity for companies to deal
intelligently with unions, explain-
ing ._that large-scale, unionization;
is hereto stay. Unions, he said,f
are learning discipline and are
paying more heed to the needs of
the workers than they have in the
past.

The labor organization of the
future will be of the industrial
rather than the craft union type
because of the strength of the
former, accordinsgt-o the professor.

Dr. Daugherty emphasized that
the employer must deal i.n good
faith with organized labor. Much
of the trouble General Motors has
had with wildcat strikes, he stated,
has come through their half-heart-
ed negotiations with the CIO.
United States Steel, he pointed out
has had little labor trouble since
adopting a more friendly attitude
toward the SWOC.

During the course of his speech,
Dr. Daugherty traced the develop-
ment of unions since the World
War, explaining the t«hree—fold-"at-
tack which the employers use to
ﬁght them: propaganda, to de-
fame unions in public opinion; the
use of “welfare measures” which
reallv are vague concessions to the
employees to keep them in a
“good mental. condition,” and
propaganda. ,

p The _worker, according to Dr.
Daugherty, is interested" in two’
major things: how long _his job
will last and better wages. Aside
from these he is also interested in

J. Lloyd Mahoney
Claims 1,400 Woinen
Enlisted For Classes

The 1929 crash and ensuing de-
pression had at least one good re-
sult, claims J. Lloyd Mahoney, di-

Division.

Housewives have become educa-
tion-conscious. Now they are
as something more than mere
drudgery.

Mr. Mahoney claims that the de-

how economically incapable they
had been in managing their homes.
So they decided to do something
about it.

Last year more than 1,400 wo-
men took courses in the Evening
Division. More than that num-
ber, it is estimated will enroll this
year. And last year there were
more housewives than business

Mahony says.

“Many women told me that
their husbands made a miserable
job of handling family finances,”
Mr. Mahony says.

>“Some of them believed that
their husbands did" as well as
could be expected, “but that they,
the partners in ‘Home, Inc.,’ did
not do their share ofthe work and
thinking, wholly’ through lack of
knowledge.”

Many women spend as much as
90 per. cent of the family income, '
says Mr. Mahoney. As a result,
they are now interested in courses

in banking, accounting, ﬁnance, j

and investments.

“Equally on the "track of becom- \

ing‘_ experts,” says Mr. Mahony,
“are the housewives ' who is take
courses" in child literature and
child’ and adolescent psychology.
At ﬁrst this group was made up
of women whose‘ children were

within the last two years more and
more women have indicatedthat
they‘ are’ thoroughly satisﬁed with
their children’s behaviour,‘ but not
quite satisﬁed with the job they
themselves are‘ doing as mothers.”

If D. C‘. Schultz, BA38, has been
snooping around campus with a
predatory gleam in his eyes it is
because he is huntingrfor a place
to display an aluminum pitcher.

Souvenir of last’ week-end’s
Freshman Camp, the pitcher be-
longs to- the School of Business
Administration freshmen, under
Schultz’s direction, as "prize, for
making the best showing in inter-
school competition at the Camp.
The pitcher is to become a perma-
nent trophy award for Freshman
Camp, with its possession going to
the school winning the athletic
and stunt competitions each year.

Originated by Carl Distelhorst,
instructor in accounting, the
pitcher trophy was won by the
Biz-adstby a small margin over
the College freshman, with the En-.
gineers and Pre-meds, who com-
prised a separate group at Camp,
trailing. far behind. .

Names of the_ winning fresh-.
men, together ‘with those of their
counselor and adviser, will be
placed on. the pitcher for display
this year. Presentation of the
trophy to next year’s winners will
be made at a ceremony at the
closinféof Freshman Camp, when

Junior Varsity Football  
Candidates Report Today

New Grid Team ’

Brings More
Students To Sport

“Football for all!” is the
new slogan up in the Stadium
office. 011 Monday the Panther
athletic depart,ment virtually
threw open the gates of the
Stadium to everyone who has
the desire a11d the will to play
the pigskin game.

This announcement, establish-
ing a junior varsity football team,
was made Monday morning by
James A. Hagan, director of ath-
letics.
or senior boy is eligible to play on
the junior varsity squad.

Harvey Rooker, director of in-
tramural athletics, has been ap-
pointed coach of the team and is-
sued a call this morning for all
candidates to report to him in the
Stadium locker rooms inside Gate
3 this afternoon at 1:30.

FIRST TIME AT PITT

This is the first time that the
University has attempted to estab-
lish a junior varsity or 150-pound
eleven. In an interview with a
News reporter Coach Rooker gave
the reason for the establishment
of the team.

“Realizing that there are a great
many boys in the school who en-
joy playing the game of football,
but who do not feel that they
could make the varsity squad,
either because of size or ability,
the athletic department has un-
dertaken. the establishment of a
junior varsity team. It will ﬁll a
great need at the University, and
although it is only the ﬁrst year}
that the idea has been attempted,}
I feel that it will be very success-
ful ”

Coach Rooker is anxious to get
under way in as short a time as
possible and issued a call for all
candidates to report to the Sta-
dium locker room inside Gate:
3 this afternoon at 1:30 o‘clock;
when equipment will be issuedi
and practice sessions begun.

Dr. John Dambach, director of
physical education, has made it
compulsory for all physical educa-
tion majors not out for any var-
sity sport at this time to report for
junior varsity football. The phy-
sical education students will form
a group of about thirty candidates.

Everyone out for the sport
should have a physical examina-
tion from Dr. Carlson as soon as
possible and if possible some time
this week.

ROOKER TO COACH

The schedule has not been made
up yet, but James Hagan is work-
ing on a schedule for late‘ October
and November. Games will be
booked with high schools, private
schools, college freshmen, and
college junior varsity teams.

Rooker, who was a star end on
the Panther elevens of ’32, ’33, and
’34, was recently appointed suc-
cessor to Martin J. Feely as di-
rector of intramural athletics.
Before coming to the University
he was football coach at Cone-
maugh High School. He has a
very ﬁne record at Conemaugh
where he took over a team that
had fallen into the football dol-
drums and made a leading con-
tender out of it.

Junior varsity and 150-pound
football elevens have been estab-
lished at many of the eastern col-
leges and universities and have
proved very successful.

cross country schedule. Olson,
Pitt track and cross country men-

Tech, Wayne, and Penn- State, the
Panthers will face four squads,

the most successful dual meet
seasons in Pitt hill and dale his-
tory.

The newcomer to the schedule
is Purdue, which replaces the na-
tional championship Michigan
State team. Bethany, Tech, and
Purdue will all be met on the
Panther’s home grounds, the val-
leys and hills of Schenley Park.

Visiting meets will take them to
Detroit, where the cross country
terrain is more of the prairie va-
riety, when they meet the Wayne
University harriers. The other
away engagement is in the famil-
iar Pennsylvania hills against the
Penn State Lions at State Col-
lege, Pa.

N atators Keep
Splashing
All Year

There was plenty of stroking
by the Pitt team this summer.

While Albert Beacon, Milt Led-
erstein, Alex Sladodian, Wally
Nowatny and Tom Locke won
honors on» a makeshift team of
Pitt swimmers, Jake Morris and
Tom Anderson, as lifeguards,
feuded at Riverview Park as to
whether swimming trunks should
have tops or not.

Bill Brown and Red McQuillan
spent the summer at the city pools
as life guards improving their
diving. At Buhn’s swanky pool in
Sharon, William Dill mixed golf,
tennis, and riding with swimming
and lifesaving. Hyman Richman,
breast stroker, who announced for
Pitt’s team this summer during
meets and exhibitions won merits
when he saved a -girl from drown-
ing. -

At Highland Park Lederstein,
Nowatny, Beacon, Slobodian, and
Locke easily .Won the Pittsburgh
Sun-Telegraph trophy with the to-
tal of 59 points, 31 points ahead
of the next contestants, the Bu-
reau of Recreation. The Bureau
took only 28 points and won only
two first places. Felix Cierbcz,
ace swimmer for the Bureau, one
of two who took a first place, is a
freshman in the University and
will swim for Pitt this year.

During a downpour of rain this
team scored another victory at
South Park. In a short while the
Panther tank stars took 21 points,
ten points more than the next con-
testants could gain. The Center
Avenue “Y,” with 11 points were
second. Other entries gained only
a few minor points.

Albert Beacon won a first place
in the National AAU Cham-
pionship in the Individual Medley
in Chicago this year.

At Highland Park, Milt Leder-
stein broke two previous records,
the 880 and 440 yard free style
swimming mark. Later, at the
South Park Meet he broke his own
440 yard free style record.

COCKINESS STAYS

The dominant trend in the Pan-
ther practice drills of the past two
weeks has been the-feeling of con--
fidence that has been evidenced by
the Pitt players. "Dr. Sutherland’s
policy from the beginning has been
to break it down. — '

This was apparent when he or-
dered scrimmage the second day
out. These scrimmages have con-
tinued right up to now, but, as for
ridding the cockiness, its accom-
plishments have been nil.

Dr. Sutherland looks forward to
the opener Saturday against Ohio

-Every Graduating
Olsonman Receives
Good Start

By AL MALAKOFF

Seven seniors,- seven success
stories. That’s Coach Olson’s fav-
orite tale. Of the seven senior:
trackmen who participated in last
year’s meets, he reports, not one
has failed to get ahead.

There’s Harold “Red” Tost, for

example, who holds a responsible
post in the sales organization of a
prominent automobile concern.
Tost was somewhat successful at
Pitt, too. Besides holding the Uni-
versity two-mile run record, he
was a top miler and captain of the
track team, a top cross-country
man and captain of the cross-
country team. To top off all of
which, he won the Wettach Award.
LEGGIN DOES RESEARCH

Alex Leggin is doing research
on a Mellon Institute fellowship,
and working for his Ph. D. He
did exceedingly well in. the mile,
the half-mile, and in cross-coun-
try. Besides this, he managed to
squeeze in his duties as cadet
colonel in the ROTC.

Sprinter Eddy Spitz is doing
quite well as a “drummer” for
three furniture companies, thank
you. At school he was a “cen-
tury” man, and member of the
sprint team in the Penn Relays.

Numbered among the lucky ﬁfty
who were chosen from over eight
hundred applicants for admission
to the, School of Medicine was
George Cook. George was a right
good two-miler and cross-coun-
tryman.

To help ﬁnance their ways

either the cafeteria or the Faculty

had, they went out and made out-
standing track records".

All of which certainly helps to
bear out Coach Olson’s proud‘
boast that “There are few univer-
sities in the United States that
hzzve had any team with such a‘
ﬁne group of boys.”

While he is still feeling pretty
good about last year’s team, Ol-
son will get somewhat of a‘ shock.
when he realizes that he doesn't
have those boys to run cross-coun-

graduation are about as accentu-

John Dickinson, a first-year end,
who is speeding for a varsity post
faster than Woodruff can kick up
divots on the track, is always
facetious when being questioned
by The News. He can’t be pinned
down on the gridiron or in an in-
terview. He says, “I always think
of the cheer leaders when I play.
The poor eggs wouldn’t really earn
their letters unless they had some-
thing to cheer about. And I’m
