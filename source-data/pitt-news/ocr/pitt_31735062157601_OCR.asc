Chancellor Rufus II. Fitzger-
ald will meet parents of fresh-
men students at a reception
this evening at 8:15 p. In. in
the Commons Room.

Upwards of 1500 guests
are expected to attend the
Chancellor’s reception. Consider-
ed one of the most important
events on the University calendar,
this reception gives the parents a
chance to acquaint themselves
with the university, its tradition,
and leaders. For the past 28 years
it has helped create a feeling of
understanding between parents
and the university.

A program in the Commons

Room, a tour of the university, and '
a reception, at which refreshments
will be served, will highlight the

evening’s activities.-The program, "

will take place in the Commons, 

Room, which will be set up as
an auditorium to accommodate the
large number of parents expected
to attend. A

Short Talks by Deans

Short talksiby the deans of the i 

College, School of Engineering -A

women, and Chancellor Fitzger-
ald will make the mainaddresses.

Dean Rus/h will speak on- stu-
dent life, while Chancellor Fitz-
geraldfs speech will concern it-
self with the university.

Music for the program will be
furnished by the Men’s Glee Club,
directed ‘ by David Weiss, and
Frederic Lotz at the organ.

Students Serve As Guides

Student aides, chosen for schol-

arship and leadership, will take -

the parents in separate groups on
a tour of the university after the
‘program. The ﬁne arts depart-'
ment. University library, Tuck
Shop, Nationality Rooms, and oth-
er classrooms will be all visited
by the parent groups. Approxi-

Emately 120 women and 40 men’

aides have been chosen to act as
guides for the evening.

Mrs. ‘Theodore W. Biddle, wife
of the dean of men, Mrs. Stanton

LEARN ABOUT YOUR SCHOOL

A great many people outside the school have little idea what
goes on inside the University, who directs its work, or even what
the campus looks like.

Unfortunattely this condition extends even to those men and
women whose children are Students at Pitt. That’s why the
Chancellor set aside one night each year for the speciﬁc pur-
pose of meeting the parents of freshmen, introducing them to
the men and women who run the University, and telling ‘them

. what a University education means to them and to their chil-

dren.

The Chaiicellor’s reception is important for the students,
too, for it enables their parents to see and understand the prob-
lems that they (the students).face ‘and the goals which they
are setting out to achieve. ' ' -

Often this understanding is of considerable sigiiiﬁcaiic

to the student, particularly if his parents are not college grad-
uates themselves. ’ '

So, if you’re a freshman and your parents are hesitating
about attending the reception tonight, urge them to do so. It
is an evening that willbeneﬁt them, and you, and the Univer-
sity. ‘, .

NO FRONT OFFICE BACKING

Student Congress has collided head on with the University
Social Calendar and the Univeréity deans with the result that

,the “Beat State” pep rally, preniiially the biggest of the year,

is liable to turn into a ﬁasco.

Up until last year this pre—Penn State rally was held Fri-
day morning—with classes dismissed. Last year Congress de-
cided to try something a little different, an eveningbonﬁre
rally. It drew a pretty good crowd, but a faulty public ad-
dress system and soine other ﬂaws in planning brought the
whole thin_g to nought. " - .

_ This year Congress wanted to try the same thing again.
But Nov. 19, the Friday preceding the Penn State‘ game, is
also the date of the Junior Prom. Since there could be no com-
petition with the dance, the Friday evening scheme, was ruled
ou . ' ~

The: natural alternative was a Friday morning rally with
classes dismissed. But the University deans demurred. They
wouldn’t order a dismissal of classes.

F_ lglow the rally is scheduled for Thursday ‘evening at Bubbles
ie . .. ~

We thought that the Notre -Dameevening rally proved to
everyone ’s satisfaction that night rallies don’t draw—_even on
Friday night. Holding one on Thursday night is just going to
make things worse. , ‘ _ _

Students have classes Friday. They have to study Thurs-
day night. Some have long trips to their homes. Few will feel
much like sticking around until rally time (which will en-
tail eating supper here) then going home to do their studying.
It really isn’t fair to ask them to do it. .

Friday night, of course, is ‘out of the question.’ That leaves

.it up to the deans. It’s our understanding that one class-

dismissed. rally a year is authorized. Perhaps they feel that
the dismissal for the post—Indiana celebration was enough.
Maybe they feel that they’re getting back at the students for
the commotion that followed the “fest Virginia victory.
Either way, we think they ’re wrong. The Penn State rally
always has been, and shouldbe now, the biggest of the year.
It won’t be_ if it’s held Thursday night as is now planned.
It could be if the deans will dismiss classes for ‘just one hour

next week. That shouldn’t be asking too much of them.

Sense-Les

By LES GALLAGHER

Last night, at eleven forty-ﬁve,
Henry A. (the A standing for
many things) Wallace said,
“Baaaa.” In his own sweet, inimi-
table style it was his way of con-
ceding victory to that other can-
didate. For the past eight days the
Progressive party has recounted
the votes‘ twice. It was a lovely
gesture on their part and a ﬁne
tribute to their leader.’ But it was
to no avail because last night, in
that great western state ofiUtah,
the ﬁnal vote was tabulated for
the third‘ time and Henry Agar
was still Henry Agar“, a humiliat-

of counting can rectify. It is at

this point that the American peo-
ple should rise and thank this lad
from, the mid-west ‘for at_ ‘least
making the election interesting.
Although it was ‘Henry’s aim to

election ,this self-appointed proph-
et, this self-envisioned savior of
North American mankind, failed.
And now Henry has been relegat-
ed to his role in history, a ‘few
lines in a text book, a few phrases
around a pot—bellied stove or a
quiz program answer. And some
night in the year 1972 on the tech-
nicolored television . quiz show,
“T_ake It or Leave It,” the quiz
master will ask, “During the close-
ly contested presidential election
of "1948 between Truman and
Dewey there was a third party,
now can you tell me, Mr. Semph—
durkin, -who it was that ran as the
Progressive Party candidate?”

Whose Faulf

the contestant will be sad and go
home to his home in Iowa and talk
about his visit to New York and
his being on a.quiz program. And
only a few in the audience will
have remembered. It is all very
sad but the saddest tale of mice
and men is to set out to get re-
venge on- someone who has
"wronged you and to feel that re-
venge boomerang iniyour face.
But the fool is not to blame; it is
the authorities who allow_ him to
runlloose. ‘

‘When the occasion demands I
drop around ‘to the barber shop for
a haircut, as is the case with the
male portion of our present civil-
ization. But yesterday I had a
rude awakening; haircuts are up
to a buck and a quarter a clip.
But it was such a nice haircut that
I just couldn’t get angry. Boy, it
was nice. I think that it was the
nicest haircut anyone ever had,
anywhere. I stepped down from
the chair and looked in the mir-
ror. “Gee, it’s a beaut,” I smiled
at the barber. “I’m so glad you
like,” he smiled and his eyes were
moist and there was a strange
sadness in ihs face. '

Anofher Sad Story

‘It was then I knew that behind
this little man there was a story.
A sad, lonesome, struggling story
of a man with a desire. And as the
rain cried against the window,
greying—out the distant promise of
the horizon he spoke haltingly of
what it was. ~“Forty-two year
back, I come America with little
mudder and little brudder. I have

I work hard in. steel mill, make
lousy 90 dollar a week. I open lit-

cut shop, it take 20 year before I
slave like dog; ten to six except

rest. All my life I slave like this
for bare needs; a car, a little home
in Mount Lebanon, send kids col-
lege, keep wife happy with fur
coat. Now I own three shops but
I am sad, this country is good but
she is not like old country.”

He leaped up and walked out
the door, the last time I saw him
he was walking towards the old
country. Moral of story: no mat-
ter what you are doing, if you
don’t like it, start walking. But
another angle is to know when to

is to know when you’ve never had

Tutoring for Freshmen Coeds

Planned by WSGA Mentors

Tutoring service for freshmen women becomes available early
next week when upperclass mentors set up headquarters on the
_twelfth ﬂoor.

Smooth operation of this innovation in WSGA services to fresh-
men is contingent upon a large number of upperclass women volun-
teering to devote an hour or two in the capacity of tutors, according
to Carol Nunes, Scholastic Honors chairman of WSGA.

According to plans, juniors or’
seniors interested in donating time

and energy to this project should
report to Miss Nunes as soon as
possible. Interested coeds may
leave their names and a list of free
hours with Mrs. Starrett in 1209
Cl., the chairman reported.

Beginning next week, and for
two weeks thereafter, freshmen‘
women interested in upping their
respective averages in classes
where the outlook is gloomy
should report to the tutors for
help, WSGA president Ginny Rey-
nolds advises.

Tutoring in coed circles is one
of many new features added to the
respective committees of WSGA
this year. It matches service's,of-
fered male students by Phi’ Eta
Sigma. .

Before the Indiana game many
students were ‘unaware of the
fact that the boys were playing
their ﬁfth home game here at the
stadium. One student said, “Why
don’t they tell us these things?”

Coming basketball and numer-
ous proms might beneﬁt if such
queries could be eliminated by
publicity.‘ '

The 1947 Student Congress
boosted the idea except for ad-
ministration approval. The pres-
ent Congress, having_ picked up
the suggestions, says that they
will strive to see them installed.

Hincke, professor of military science and tactics, the Army will ‘on.
commissions for active duty to young men who have served or
year or more in the Armed Forces and have completed two 4
more years of college or university education.

The applicant must pass a phys-
ical examination in addition to the
educational requirements and must
agree to serve on active duty for
at least two years after his ap-
pointment. In addition, he must

Trailing 7-0 late in the second

Pitt Sick Bay Loaded
As Griclclers Entrain
On Last Road Trip

By _MYRON KOPELMAN

VVith only a day remaining before the Pitt-Purdue battle,-
the Panther football roster reads like the registration list
a-t the Mercy Hospital. No less than 15 men are on the injured

\Ves Fesler’s Ohio State Wrecking crew left the Panthers
with an assortment of injured hips, legs, ankles, and faces.
Fortunately no spinal injuries were reported, despite the fact

that the Panthers spent most of
the afternoon landing on their
backs. ‘
Centers Damaged

The Pitt team was damaged,
most at the center position where
you have to burrow down to the
fourth team before you ﬁnd a cen-
ter in good condition. He is George

Radosevich, an ambitious, but in-

experienced, sophomore.

Regular center Don Fisher, his
knee wrapped up, will see action
tomorrow despite the fact that he
is not able to pivot. Second-string
snapper Len Radnor will be ham-
pered by an injured leg and
sprained ankle.

Center George Steingraber joins
halfback Bill Bruno and guard
Tony Razzano on the out-for-the-
season list. Steingraber’s cheek-
bone was fractured last week.-

Plotz Out

Aside from the permanently
sidelined, the only Panther who is
sure not play tomorrow is tackle
Bob Plotz, who injured a leg.

Nursing sprained ankles, how-
ever, are tackles Wib Forsythe
and Ralph Coleman. Hurt hips be-
long to end Leo Skladany, guard
Chuck Thomas, quarterback Pete
Fuderich, and h a 1 f b a c k Jack
Smo_dic._ . '

Fullback Bob Becker and guards
Laurice Pierce and Mike Boldin
are in a general beat-up condition,

Head Coach Mike Milligan, per-
haps realizing thath-is team may

not be able to endure a gruelling 7.
‘ground battle tomorrow, put the

emphasis on passing in this week’s
practice sessions. ‘“ '
- Work on Passes

Long passes were given particu- '0
lar attention. Maybe Milligan is

hoping to pull a few scores out of
the bag the easy way.’

The Panthers also drilled against
the T-formation, Purdue style.
Ralph_Short, a big tackle, played
therole of Bob DeMoss, Boiler-
maker quarterback, and ﬂitted
around in the backﬁeld with no
small amount of grace.

High-Scorer: Canterna and David

Selected Basketball Co-Captains

By SAM SPATTER _

Two men, Ol-and (Dodo) Canterna and Sammy David, out
for their fourth basketball season here, have been named
co-captains of the Pitt basketball team for the coming season.

The appointments were announced’ this week by Dr. H. C.
Calrlson, Panther coach. Both are seniors.

Canterna led the Panther attack last year with 80 field
goals and 84 charity tosses, for a mark of 244, three points
better than teammate David, who scored 241 points from 71
ﬁeld goals and 99 free throws. David was high scorer in 1946.

Back in 1944, a young hoopster from Freeport High named

Dodo Canterna set a Stadium scor-
ing record of 37 points, in a game
against Westminster. And last
season, the good-looking Freeport
forward scored the highest single
game total for a Panther by notch-
ing 22 .points ‘against West Vir-
ginia.
Try’ for Scoring Mark

Sammy David, th e
Syrian lad from. Bridgeville, has
never fallen below the hundred
mark while at Pitt. He began his

‘ career at the Oakland school with

112 points during 1945-46, scooted
it up to 177 the next season, and

.closed last year with a 24l—-a

three year total of 530. ,,

Both Canterna and David, who
have been as synonymous with
Pitt basketball as McPeak and
Skladany have been with Pitt
football, will be out this year to
