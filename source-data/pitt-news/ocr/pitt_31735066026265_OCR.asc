Code at conduct reaches off-campus

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

University of Pittsburgh students involved in
activities that violate the Student Code of Conduct
are now responsible for their actions off-campus
as well as those on campus. ,

Deﬁned as conduct that “demonstrates a disre-
spect for law, the rights of others, or the health.
welfare and safety of members of the university,”
a student code violation is subject to university

The addition of the off-campus clause was
approved by the Student Affairs Committee of the
Pitt board of trustees on Dec. 22.

According to Vice Chancellor of Student and
Public Affairs Dennis Donham, the new definition
was created not as a direct result of a recent inci-
dent, but has been under discussion for years.

“[The decision] was made,” Donham said, “To
make it crystal clear that if you are a student at
this university, you can’t act with reckless aban-
donment.”

Pitt /ends a
hand to
area high
school

yearbook A

By Nicole Walz
Staﬁ Writer

In 1993, Wilkinsburg High
School didn’t have a yearbook.
In 1994, the Pittsburgh area

high school had a yearbook

staff of three people and man-
aged to put together a small
book.

Now the staff has grown to
nine people and and is working
with the University of
Pittsburgh in creating a more
professional yearbook.

Tom Rostek took over the
Wilkinsburg High School year-

— book last year as the advisor.

He didn’t have much experi-
ence with yearbooks, so he
asked for help from the
University of Pittsburgh’s
Panther Prints.

“I was hoping for one day of
help,” Rostek said. It has
developed into periodical
meetings working side by side
the Panther Prints staff.

“Dr. Terry Milani (assistant
director of Student Activities)
came to us and asked us if we
would help. The advisor had
called and was referred to us,”
said Stephanie Mescall, the
editor—in-chief of Panther
Prints.

Wilkinsburg had only four
students on the staff when the
Panther Prints staff met with
them. The high school’s bud-
get was also $3,000 dollars in
debt.

“We started doing this in late
September. There has been a
definite improvement. They
brought in younger students so
they’ll know what to do later,”
Mescall said.

Pitt’s staff will be taking the
Wilkinsburg group step-by-
step through the yearbook-
making process. Together, the

Greek rush is nearing
an end this week as fra-
ternities and sororities
continue to scramble for
pledges.

Unlike the fall rush,
which benefits heavily
from the new crop of
incoming students,
spring rush is tougher.

For one thing, many
students have decided
already whether or not to
turn Greek. Another con-
tributing factor is the
cold weather. Many stu-
dents would rather stay
in and study than venture
out to pool tournaments
and -buffets with the
brothers and/or sisters.

“I don’t think numbers
are extremely low,” said
Panhellenic Association
President Cara Appel.

Panhel is the governing
body for sororities on
campus, and it oversee
much of the fall rush.
However, Appel pointed

informal, which means

Pitt students march for life inD.C.

By David Palmer
For The Pitt News

Monday, 20 members of Pitt’s Students for
Life Organization participated in the 22nd
annual March for Life in Washington D.C.

This march marked the 22nd anniversary of
the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized
abortion. .

“The purpose of this march is tell President
Bill Clinton and everyone who works in D.C.
that we are against the Roe vs. Wade decision
which legalized abortion,” said Sophia
Kusturis, vice-president of Students for Life.

The March for Life program began Monday
at noon with the Rally of Ellipse. The crowd
of about 100,000 people who attended the
rally was addressed by several pro—life mem-
bers of Congress and heads of pro-life organi-
zations.

“Standing among the thousands of people, I
realized two important things. First is how
urgent it is to protect the unborn children that
are being murdered everyday, and the second
is we’re not here fighting for ‘a cause’, but
rather because we cherish life,” said Susan
Stonehouse, a Students for Life member.

The rally ended around 2 p.m. and the
activists began the march. The march started
on Constitution Avenue, passed the Supreme
Court and ended at the Capitol building.

During this mostly peaceful march, the
activists displayed signs supporting the rights
of unborn babies.

After reaching the Capitol, members of
Congress from all over the nation were avail-
able to answer questions and concerns of the
activists.

Rick Santorum, Arlen Specter and Mike
Doyle were at the Capitol representing
Pennsylvania. » .

Santorum said he supported this effort, but
needs continued support to fight for pro-life
causes.

The Students for Life said they felt the
march was very successful.

“This year there was a large number of
freshmen and incumbent congressmen who

spoke in defense of life. They promised us a _

continuing effort to change or form new laws
to represent the true pro—life face of America,”
said Ben Garrett, a Students for Life member.
The rally drew over 100,000 pro-life sup-
porters while very few pro-choice activists
attended the march to oppose the effort.

At Pitt, “study abroad”

Semester at Sea
continues with visits
to Singapore,
Malaysia and Egypt

( Tony F iorini is a photographer

for The Pitt News and was on

the Semester at Sea program
last semester.)

We got back on the ship after
four wonderful days in Beijing

- only to hear some bad news.

The rumor was that we were
going to have to cancel our stop
to India because of the plague,
and unfortunately that rumor
was confirmed. We had all
heard about the plague infesting
India and wondered if we
would be making our scheduled
stop in Madras for quite some
time. There was nothing
Semester at Sea could do. If we
did decide to stop in India, there
was a chance that the immigra-
tion officials in Egypt, Israel
and Turkey would not let us
stop in their countries. India
was a very important stop,
mainly due to the extreme
poverty that is present there. It
was a heartbreak to hear we
were not going to be able to
stop in Madras.

As we sailed to the
Philippines, the SAS staff raced
to find replacements. Several
other ports were considered to
replace India. Singapore,
Malaysia and Colombo, Sri
Lanka were all mentioned, but
Sri Lanka won out in the end.
Our schedule allowed us to
spend an extra day there, giving
us six full days, enough to
explore the entire island.

Having done a lot of orga-
nized trips in the Philippines
and Vietnam, I wanted to do
some independent travel. Six
friends and I decided to rent a
van and driver for four days and
go wherever we wanted. No
tour guides, no arrangements,
just us, our driver, and the
roads. Did I say roads? I meant
one-lane dirt paths that cars and
trucks used as roads. Not to
mention that traffic lights, if
there were any, were complete-

ly ignored, and the horn is used
very liberally. They also drive
British—style, on the left of the
road and the right of the car,
which explains why I became
very alarmed to wake up in the
middle of the night on the road
to see my friend in the passen-
ger seat (our driver’s seat) with
his head against the window
sleeping. I thought we were
going to wreck for sure.

We became acquainted with
the driving system, but the peo-
ple remained pretty mysterious.
Take, for instance, the “Sri
Lankan head nod.” It ﬁrst
appeared when we asked our
driver if he knew where a good
motel was. His reply was, “Yea,
sure,” with an accompanying
Stevie Wonder—like figure-eight
head nod. It looked like he was
saying yes, and shaking his
head no. That really took a
while to get used to. .

After spending a day in the
north, we traveled south to the
white sand beaches of
Hikkaduwa, a small tourist
town on the west coast. It was
our self-proclaimed winter
break, and we decided to spend
two days alone on the beach for
some much needed rest and
relaxation. What I did not
expect was to wake up the next
morning to ﬁnd cows on the
beach where I wanted to do my
relaxing. Sri Lanka is a predom-
inantly Hindu country, and in
the Hindu faith cows are sacred.
Not only are they on the beach-
es, but they are also on the
roads, in fields and in the
forests. After a while, they
moved and I got my view of the
beach back, but now I am start-
ing to miss having cows block
my view.

We left Sri Lanka, like every
other country, a bit too soon for
my tastes. I could have spent a
year exploring the country.

When we left from

Pitt student Christian Thompson ﬂoats in the Dead Sea.

Camel drivers are a familiar sight at the Pyramids of Egypt.

Vancouver in September, stop-
ping in Egypt was a maybe at
best. As the good news opposed
the bad news of not going to
India, it was announced that we
were going to spend 36 hours in
one of the most ancient civiliza-
tions on earth. As the ship went
through the Suez Canal, con-
necting the Red Sea with the
Mediterranean Sea, we traveled
to Cairo. Driving through town,
on the way to our hotel, I got
my first glimpse of the pyra-
mids. Looking through the edge
of town, off in the distance
there it was, the top half of the
tallest one. I could not believe
it. Everyone in the bus had their
noses pressed against the glass
to get a look.

My first activity was a meet-

Tony Fiorini/Staff Photographer

ing with college students at the
diplomats club. We talked about
current Egyptian affairs, most
importantly population control.
It was a very enlightening expe-
rience to hear, ﬁrst hand, what
the people had to say. It was
getting late, and I wanted to get
back to the hotel. From my win-
dow I could see them. The
pyramids are like a giant mag-
net, calling you to come closer
and investigate all their myster-
ies. V

I got up at 5 a.m., ate a quick
breakfast, and headed off. As
always, there were many people
waiting in the lobby to help
you, for a price of course.
“Need guide?” was the usual
question. Two friends and I
picked one man and asked him
if we could ride horses to the
pyramids. He knew just what
we wanted, took us to another
guy with the horses, and we

were on our way.
On the ride of about 15 or 20

Tony Fiorini/Staff Photograr

minutes, I asked the guide what
my horse’s name was. He said,
in an Egyptian accent, “Michael
Jackson.” I just laughed and
kept going. The sunrise was
pretty incredible. This is one of
those cases where words just
can’t express the scene. The site
where they are is not like
Disneyland —— there are no
gates, you don’t have to pay,
you just go and wander around.
You can go inside the biggest
one, Cheops. You basically
walk down this little, dark tun-
nel into a small room. There is
nothing inside but a hole in the
ground where a sarcophagus
was.

On the way back to the ship,
we stopped at the Cairo muse-
um to see some of the things
found in and around the pyra-
mids. We continued north to
Port Said in the Mediterranean
Sea where we met up with the
ship for the short sail to Israel.

cause so much undue con-
sternation. Writing to his
nephew, Baldwin indicated,
“Any upheaval in the uni-
verse is terrifying because it
so profoundly attacks one’s
sense of one’s reality. Well,
the Black man has func-
tioned in the White man’s
world as a fixed star, as an
immovable pillar: and as he
moves out of his place, heav-
en and earth are shaken to
their foundations” (1963,
20). “Black History Month,”
“Black Studies,” and quite
often, simply using “black”
as an adjective or noun,
cause some white and black
psyches to tremble. Consider
the following illustrations.

The internationally
renowned trial lawyer,

Nathaniel S. Colley Sr.,
graduated from Yale Law
School, distinguished him-
self nationally with the
NAACP, retired as an army
captain,

taught in a

California law school, had a
separate personal audience
with Presidents Kennedy,
Reagan and Carter and
served as the Chairman of
California’s Horse Racing
Board. Colley, proud of his
accomplishments, appeared
at a formal thoroughbred
owners’ event to deliver the
keynote address. When he
took his designated seat, a
white female inquired seri-
ously, “For whom do you
groom?” The only place for a
black manin that woman’s_
horse racing constellation
was that of groom.

A few years later when
Colley and his wife returned
from lecturing in China, his
wife decided to join their
son—in-law for a Chinese cul-
tural event in Pittsburgh.

ment, the son-in-law had to

without him, a white univer-
sity individual sitting at the
table said, “Sorry, you folks
can’t sit here. This table is
reserved for Associate
Provost Jack L. Daniel and
his guests.” Within the past
two years, a white candidate
for a university administra-
tive position arrived at the
Provost’s Office, and was
introduced to me with, “Dr.
——, this is Vice Provost
Jack Daniel.” I shook hands
and said, ‘‘I am pleased to
meet you. How are things

replied, “Fine, so far. Now, I

Be assured that the forego-
ing personal experiences are
not atypical. Indeed, several
recent books attest to the
frustrations of African
Americans who face such
racist behavior in their daily
lives. At this university, most
African-American faculty
can present a personal

episode. Our former distin-
guished Provost Donald M.
Henderson, as an associate
provost, encountered diffi-
culty entering the chancel-
lor’s residence to attend a
social event to which he had
been invited. One current
African-American adminis-
trator was once apprehended
by campus police based on
his color and sex. A white
book salesperson entered the
office of a university
African-American female
faculty member, and
inquired, “Would you please
tell me where I can find Dr.
—-?” Despite several polite
attempts to indicate that she
was Dr. ——-, the sales person
“just didn’t get it.” An
African-American student
was ignored the first half of
the term by a white faculty
member, but she was called
on when the faculty member
began to discuss urban
poverty, even though she did
not have her hand raised. As

you might have guessed, the
student was from a wealthy
family. Last year, I had to
intervene in order for an
African-American first-year
student to take an advanced
class into which she had
placed. Based on her color
and the assumption that she
was “educationally disadvan-
taged,” she was advised that
she was enrolled improperly.
We have made great strides
at the University -of
Pittsburgh with regard to

addressing the diversity

agenda. Yet, we have so far
to go. We must erase the
extensive racist misinforma-
tion that permits people to
ask, “For whom do you
groom?” We must address
the fact that some believe
that French and Italian
accents are “so sexy,” that
there is something “cultural-
ly distinguishing” about
Henry Kissinger’s, Jimmy
Carter’s and John Kennedy’s
dialects, but an African-
American dialect is not
viewed as the beautiful
“thaaang” that it is. On the
contrary, some white and
some African-Americans
view African-American
dialects as proof positive of
low African-American intel-
ligence and moral behavior
—-— evidence for the bell-
shaped curve, and the racist
subtitle of Darwin’s “Origin
of Species”, e.g. “Or the
Preservation of Favored
Races in the Struggle for
Life.”

Somehow, we must help
students realize that my
African-American rhetoric
course is no more a “course
for African-American stu-
dents” than the ltalian lan-
guages and literature courses
are “courses for Italian stu-
dents.” Somehow, we must
get people to realize that
when Nancy Washington,
Adrian Massey, Jack L.
Daniel, Leon Haley and
Dave Epperson sit together,
it is no more “self-segrega-
tion based on race” than
when J. Dennis O’ Connor,
Mary L. Briscoe, James V.
Maher, Nancy White and

Thomas P. Detre sit together.’

Somehow, we must get to the
point where we are no more
threatened by an African-
American Cultural Center
than we are by a Frick Fine
Arts Building. Somehow, we
must modify the dominant,
negative, black, brown, red,
yellow and white racial con-
stellations, and replace them
with those appropriate for
life in a great university
functioning in the technolog-
ical, technicolored, 21st cen-
tury. As we go through this
critical planning phase in the
life of our university, let’s
plan for this new reality.
Perhaps our children will get
beyond the nonsense of race.
Hopefully, it will not take

‘more than another generation
for us to realize that “All...” -

is always non-‘applicable for
describing racial groups.

a rush.

At the other end of the spec-

conduct rush in the spring
much like that in the fall.
Prospective pledges are wined

numbers. For instance, a pam-

talked of a seafood spectacular,
a pool tournament at Peter’s

dinner at 5:01 last Friday.

“Rush officially [ended] at
5:01 Friday the 20th,” said
Interfraternity Council Vice
President George Raudenbush.
“Bid cards [had] to be turned
in by then.” .

However, due to an extreme-
ly low turnout at their rush
functions, Sigma Chi is
attempting another rush that
will conclude in two weeks.

“We didn’t publicize rush
enough this semester,” said
Greg Simunick, rush chairman
for Sigma Chi. “We started on
the Sunday before Martin
Luther King day and a lot of
people went home for that
weekend.”

Simunick also said numbers
for fall rush usually range in
the area of 300. His spring rush
estimates were considerably
lower, ranging in the area of
103.

The low turnout this semes-
ter was felt by other fraternities
as well. Delta Tau Delta
reported only 20 rushees and
five pledges.

John Ifft, president of Delta
Tau Delta reiterated that he
considered the spring rush a
successful one.

“We did great,” he said. “We
were only looking to get 5
good guys this semester.”

Ifft also said many of the
rushees in the spring are carry-

overs from the fall, those who 8
couldn’t rush for one reason or’

another.

,“This puts the word out,
maybe a little clearer,” he said.

Donham said Pitt is an insti-
tution with very high standards,
and the thinking of those who
imposed the change is that they
don’t expect action will be nec-
essary unless the incident is a
very serious situation.

_ In terms of how far off-cam-
pus is defined as, “In practice it
means something probably
close to campus like Oakland
Avenue,” Donham said. “But in
the rare cases it could be farther
out.”

In response to the necessity
of the new wording, Donham
said, “I think if you look at
society in the last several years,
there are things that are happen-
ing that are manifestations of
violence.”

The next morning we were in

Israel, our first first-world coun-
try since Japan. I spent a day in
Nazareth and Galilee, a day in
Jerusalem and Bethlehem, a day
in Masada and the Dead Sea
and a day in Tel Aviv. The
Jewish religion is, needless to
say, a very big part of Israel.
During the Sabbath, sundown
on Friday to sundown on
Saturday, all the public stores
and such close. It is a day of
rest, and no work is to be done.
This was almost as strange as
the ever-present military. I can
remember never being out of
sight of a soldier with a
machine gun strapped around
his or her back. It was part of
the scenery. As I met with stu-
dents from Ben-Gurion
University, I noticed that fresh-
men were about my age, 21.
Then I learned why. There is a
mandatory draft in which all

tary -.— men for three years,
women for two. It is considered
an honor to serve, and one stu-
dent said the period included
some of the best times in his life
and the worst times in his life:
the best because of the friends
he met, and the worst because
of the friends he lost. I kept this
student in mind as I roamed
around the country. I knew
there were people out there
ﬁghting every day.

The next day, on a sunny
afternoon, I went to visit the
Dead Sea, the lowest place on
earth. The water in the Dead
Sea is very, very salty, some 40
times the content of the ocean.
There are also many minerals,
and this combination of salt and
minerals allows a person to be
very buoyant in this water. You
cannot sink, but you can die.
All you would have to do is
drink some of the water, and it
would kill you. That’s why it is
called the Dead Sea —— there is

nothing living in it. It is a very
scary feeling to just sit down
and not sink. In any other water,
I would sink like a rock, but the
only thing that was under the
water was my thighs, butt and
lower back. It is kind of a hard
feeling to explain. You should
just experience it for yourself.

I spent the last day in Tel
Aviv, a very modern city, a
place where I felt at home.
They had everything you could
ﬁnd in the states. I stocked up
on things I ran out of on the
voyage. It was a good reminder
of what you are going to be
coming back to at
Christmastime.

My Semester at Sea is almost
over. Three more ports and we
will be home. I have spent some
time thinking about what it will
be like getting home. Things
will be different. I don’t think
I’ll like it. The hardest part will
be saying goodbye to the good
friends I have found on the ship.

Provide voter vehicle

In an effort to get more voters involved in American politics,
the Congress, in 1993, passed the National Voter Registration
Act. It is more popularly known as the “Motor Voter Law.” It
requires all states to provide voter registration through the driver
licensing process, through the mail and at state social service
offices.

Yesterday, Attorney General Janet Reno began suits against
Pennsylvania, California and Illinois for failure to comply with
this law. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, suits against
Michigan and South Carolina were postponed to see if they
could comply promptly.

Because democracy depends on the participation of the citi-
zens, all states should move to comply with the laws as soon as

possible. While it may not be the most pressing thing on the

state’s agenda, legislation to provide for compliance should be
easy to move through state legislatures.

There are millions of people who are eligible to vote, but are
not registered to do so. Any politician who pays more than lip
service to the values of representative government could not
oppose making the representation of the people more accurate
by providing a vehicle for more voters. \ t ‘

As President Clinton has been saying in anticipation of his
state of the union address, more people need to become involved
in the process if the government is to work for the people.

All conduct counts

The student code of conduct has been revised. The revision
includes new provisions about the off-campus behavior of Pitt
students. 4

The paragraph concerning off-campus behavior has been
amended to read that: “conduct off campus may be subject to
disciplinary action by the university if that conduct seriously
threatens the health, welfare or safety of the university commu-
nity or any individual member thereof; or that conduct reﬂects
upon the student’s character and fitness as a member of the stu-
dent body.”

According to Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Dennis
Donham, “in practice, it means something probably close to
campus, like Oakland Avenue. But in the rare cases it could be
farther out.” p -

Pitt students are members of the community on campus and,
as ‘such, ought to be held to these standards. While off campus,
especially in the Pittsburgh area where they are representatives
of Pitt to the local population, they must be held accountable for
their actions.

Because the change specifies actions close to campus and
those which threaten the university or members of the university
community, this not an attempt by the university to intrude on
the off-campus lives of its students. Instead, the situation is com-
parable to the actions of students being under the code of con-
duct when they are at a university-sponsored event.

i gnoritig--the .>w:iiSh.es:‘»f:: the

American people whom they
can disregard for another year
or so before the run up to the
1996 elections begins. Is this
really how a representative
democracy behaves?

Speaker Newt Gingrich has
blamed the recent gridlock on
the media by saying that
“there is a small group of
people so bitter about losing
control of the House that they
have decided that any device
which destroys me is legiti-
mate. I think a strategy based
on the personal destruction of
somebody is pretty amazing.”
While I agree that the liberal
establishment views the
Republicans with contempt
because they want to disman-
tle the welfare state, which is
the liberal meal ticket, I
believe that on this occasion
Gingrich has not needed the
media to help him look like a
fool. His book deal will sure-
ly go‘ down as being at a level
of stupidity, which is remark-
ably Clinton—like.

In his now-infamous book
deal, Gingrich first accepted
then declined a $4.5 million
advance from HarperCollins,
a New York publishing firm
owned by Rupert Murdoch.
Mr. Murdoch owns Fox TV
and is currently haggling with
Congress over issues having
to do with foreign ownership.

he became Speaker and here-
in lies the question of'a
severe conflict of interest.
Republicans and the Speaker
say that nothing improper
was discussed at the meeting
and since he gave the advance
back the issue is closed.
There are several reasons
why they are wrong about
this.

The first is the tremendous
hypocrisy that Gingrich
showed through that deal.

"During the l980s he forced

the Fesignation of Speaker
Jim Wright over a book deal,
and while the two situations
are not exactly alike,
Gingrich’s deal still has
impropriety written all over
it. Suspicion is heightened by
the fact that Gingrich says
that he didn’t know Murdoch
owned HarperCollins, Right!
Unfortunately, this demon-
strates that this self-appointed

“ “revolutionary” is exactly the

same as those other self-
righteous politicians who
think that the American peo-
ple are just a bunch of stupid
sheep thatwill believe what-

ever those fools in D.C. say.

The second reason is that I
don’t believe that our public
servants (note the word ser-
vants) should be making mil-
lions of dollars because of
their position in the govern-
ment. Clearly, nobody is fool-
ish enough to believe that
Gingrich was offered that
money solely on the basis of
his writing ability. This is the
man that said that he is going
to change the American polit-
ical system; this is the same
nonsense that has pervaded
politics in this country since
the 1960s.

When Gingrich and the
Republicans swept the elec-
tions last November, I believe
that it was assumed by most
Americans that in addition to
dismantling the Great Society
programs, they would also

political system away from
the special interest groups

and give it back to its rightful

owners, the American people.
However, it seems that both
parties still covet the money
of the special interest groups
over the will of the people.
As one of the most powerful
politicians in Washington,
Gingrich had no ri.ght to
make multi-million dollar
deals with a person about to
go before Congress to deal

* with his business matters.

Even though Gingrich gave
up his advance, he stillstands
to make a substantial amount
of "money from royalties. This
amount will be even larger
because of all of the publicity
from HarperCol1ins and the
media. .
Finally, there is the issue of
censorship. Last Wednesday
Rep. Meek (D-Fla) brought

' up Gingrich’s book deal in

Congress which set off a two-
hour verbal brawl that
brought the House to a com-
plete standstill. While there is
nothing new about that, since
Americans are accustomed to
these overgrown children
throwing temper tantrums and
wasting taxpayer money,
what happened next was both
shocking and disturbing. The
House voted to have Rep.
Meek’s remarks about the
Speaker’s book deal stricken
from the Congressional
Record. That this type of
behavior would occur in a so-
called democracy by a party
that claims to honor our
founding fathers is disgusting
at best, criminal at worst.
What happened to the great
debate that Gingrich wanted
to foster? What has happened

to the “revolution?” Rest- .

assured liberals, self-right-
eous politicians and special
interest groups are still very
much in control.

-During last
weekend’s
S e n i o r
Columnist Bowl, NFL

Brady draft expert
Slater Mel Kiper
said Pitt

tackle Reuben Brown will go
anywhere from 14 to 21 in
the first round of a tackle-
rich draft. Pitt rusher Curtis
Martin also played in the
game. But when talking
about the top two tiers of
running backs eligible for
the draft, Kiper didn’t even
mention Martin.

°Martin’s history of

injuries no doubt was the

cause of omission from
Kiper’s rankings because,
when healthy, Martin was
one of the most dangerous
backs in the country. He
could be a draft day steal. A
team looking to take a shot
at the frail Martin can keep
in mind that he only began
playing football his senior
year at Allderdice. That
gives Martin just five years
of football, less than that if
you subtract the time he sat
with injuries. That’s nothing
compared to the football
mileage on the rest of the
draftees’ bodies. Martin’s
body is still getting used to
the rigors of football. And
when Martin’s frame cal-
louses up to his talent, he’s
going to make some team
look awfully smart for find-
ing a feature back in a lower
round.

°Now that it’s clear that
baseball owners will not be
filling their replacement ros-
ters with their top AAA and
AA prospects, there is
absolutely no reason at all to
go to a ballgame this sum-
mer. Professional sports are
about showcasing the best in
the world at what they do.
And since replacement base-
ball won’t even be reaching
the warning track of that
ideal, I'm saving my money.

°For a literal insight into
the baseball player’s refusal
to accept a salary cap, look
no further than a recent
Congressional Research
Service report. According to
the report, had the owners’
salary cap been in effect dur-
ing the 1994 season the
amount of money going to
the players would have been
lowered by $198 million.

For any ballplayer, the last
place they want to be is on
the bench. Jerry McCullough
has no choice.

The star point guard for
the Pitt basketball team finds
himself on a different kind
of hardwood at the start of
each game. A serious knee
injury that led to reconstruc-
tive surgery in early October
knocked one of the best
point guards in the nation
off his feet and onto the

I bench.

T h e

c r a f t y

playmaker

who has

dazzled

Pitt fans

for years is now in a position

that he is not used to. He sits

and watches, unable to con-

tribute on the court. Game

in, game out, watching the

Panthers lose heartbreakers

by two or four points,

McCullough sits idly by,

unable to lead his team or hit

the winning shot they so
desperately need.

“It’s frustrating [not being
able to play],” McCullough
said. “I’m learning a lot,
though. I’m seeing the game
from a different angle, but I
miss being a player.”

McCullough is more than
just a player for the
Panthers. Unquestionably, he

is the leader and the one who
can get the team to gel and
work as a unit.

The 5—foot-ll-inch senior
is a veteran quarterback that
would make a new head
coach smile beyond the dol-
lar signs. But for Ralph
Willard, who took over the
reigns as king of the court
for the Panthers, the rug was
pulled out from under his
feet.

“Having an experienced
point guard of Jerry’s caliber
obviously would have meant
an awful lot to us,” Willard
said. “Jerry’s the type of
player that can break the
defense down and make
plays for other people as
well as himself. There aren’t
too many people who can
stop Jerry McCullough one-
on-one in this conference.”

Now McCullough can only
envision those plays, creat-
ing the euphoric moment in
his mind knowing thatihe is
on the sidelines incapable of

McCullough waits patiently

being on the court to carry

them out.

The reality of the injury is
nothing but frustrating for
the guard who hails from
New York City. Though the
pain is dissipating, the

CMU ends Pitt hockey's streak

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

Ah, the underdog. What a
cruel injustice it is that he
can wreak such havoc on a
s i m p l e
game. If
t h e r e
was even
a small
measure
of order
in this
w o r l d .
the best team on the field
would always win, right?

In that case, the Steelers
surely should have beaten
the Chargers.

The ‘6O Yankees should
have smeared our Buccos all
over Forbes Field.

In other words, until the
league office starts mailing
out victories, the Pitt
Hockey Club must learn to
steer clear of little David’s
slingshot, and the stones
which always seem to catch
them right on the melon.

In what has become an
increasingly disturbing
trend, Pitt dropped another
close contest to Carnegie
Mellon, who have estab-
lished themselves as the

 

perpetual thorn in the
Panthers’ side.

Playing the game with not
even three healthy lines,
plus the added distractions
of just one official to
call the game and skating
against a hostile crowd,
the Panthers fell victim
to circumstance as well
as their own sloppy
play. The 5-4 loss was
Pitt’s fourth straight to
the little brats down the
street.

Because of ashortage of
officials for Saturday’s con-
test, the highly CMU-parti-
san crowd played a huge
part in their team’s victory.
All this might not have
bothered the Panthers had it
not been a home game on
Pitt’s schedule.

“It was incredible  there
were over 200 people in the
stands, and almost all were
CMU’s,” Hockey Club
President Matt White said.
“I mean, here's a school
[Carnegie Mellon] that’s
just down the street, and
they manage to pack the
stands with their own fans
and it’s supposed to be our
home game . . it’s frustrat-
ing.

“The one ref called a good

game, but he had to do
twice the work, and couldn’t
see everything, so a lot of
times he went with the
crowd’s reaction. That hurt
us.”

The loss ended Pitt’s four-
game winning streak, drop-
ping them three points
behind first—place CMU in
the WPCHA Western
Division standings. The
Panthers’ four consecutive
losses to the Tartans date
back to last season, includ-
ing a 3-1 heartbreaker in the
semifinal round of last
year’s WPCHA
Championship Tournament.

Now, instead of being
alone atop the division,
where they would have been
with a victory, the Panthers
find themselves stuck in a
logjam at the middle of the
division along with Slippery
Rock, Allegheny College
and CCAC-South.

“It just didn’t seem like
our heads were in [the
game],” White said. “We
had a lot of our core missing
(12 position players to
CMU’s 17), and we made
some dumb mistakes. We
had our opportunities, but

Peterson
earns Big
East Player

of Week

Pitt's sole center Jaime
Peterson was named the Big
East Player of the Week for his
performances against Villanova
and St. John's.

Peterson, a 6-foot-9-inch
senior, averaged 21.5 points
and 9.5 rebounds this past
week. He tallied back-to—back
career-highs in points.

Peterson's 23 points led all
scorers and played an integral
role in the Panthers upset win
at St. John's on Sunday. He also
scored 20 points and grabbed
10 boards against Villanova
last Wednesday.

In the two games Peterson shot
an astounding 75 percent from
the field.

Peterson leads Pitt with a
14.5 point average and adds 9.8
rebounds a game. He leads the
Big East in rebounds and
blocked shots (4.5 a game).

Peterson is not the first
Panther to win this award.
Andre Alridge previously won
in December.

Fletcher, women's

track streak at meet

By Diavail Smith

For the Pitt News

The men’s and women_’s
track team took care of
business at the Princeton
relays last weekend.

The Lady Panthers went
for the two-for-one deal
with several of their run-
ners finish—
ing in first
placein at
least two
separate
events.

Junior

N aj u m a
Fletcher, a former
Olympian, was the excep-
tion to the two-for-one rule
for finishing first in three
different events. She took
first in the 55-meter high
hurdles with a time of 7.89
seconds. She also helped
the Lady Panthers finish in
first place in the 1600-
meter relay (3249.34) and
in the shuttle hurdles
(29.1), while setting a meet
record in the process.
Coach Steve Lewis was
pleased with the results of
last weekend.
“We had a good weekend

and did very well,” he said.

But Fletcher was not the
only standout for coach
Lewis. Junior Zenia Ayrton
also did some work, finish—
ing first in the 55-meter
dash (7.03) and the 1600-
meter relay. —

The other winners for the
women’s team included
junior Tonya Mullins, who
ran the 1600 and the shut-
tle hurdles. Angela Martin
also took care of her busi-
ness by winning the 800-
meter run (2:l2.87). She
also provided the help the
Lady Panthers needed in
the 1600.

On the men’s side of the
track, the Panthers domi-
nated the 1600-meter relay.
Jay Jones, Jerel Williams,
Jonathan Dixon and
Dietrich Jells did what they
had to do, winning the race
with a time of 3:18.24 and
qualifying for the NCAAs
in the process. , .

In the 55—meter dash,
Anthony Dorsett finished
in second place with a time
of 6:39 seconds.

Next week the Panthers
will be running at the
Boston Invitational, held at
Boston University.

When most college stu-
dents turn 20, they tend to
go out on the town quite a
bit. For Pitt sophomore
diver John Soulakis, this is
not the case.

Soulakis gives the major-
ity of his time to his studies
and his diving. It’s normal
for him to get burned out
because he doesn’t have
much time to himself, but
he eventually snaps out of
it and doesn’t mind the rou-
tine.

“I’m really happy with
my decision to come to
Pitt,” he said.

As well he should be,
because he has made a
name for himself early on
as a Pitt diver. ‘

Soulakis, from Ellicot
City, Md., was the first
male freshman at Pitt to
compete at the NCAA
Championship swim meet
last year.

“He dove well for himself
on the spring board and did
exceptional on the plat-
form,” head diving coach
Julian Krug said.

He placed llth “ on
the platform at the meet
and was named Honorable
Mention All-American,
all in his first year of
diving at Pitt.

In Soulakis’ second
year, he is keeping
the name he made for him-
self and making it better.
At the Buffalo Invitational
in December, he
qualified to go to the
NCAA Zone Qualifying
meet to try and make it to

I have one question for you ’— Are you brain
dead? This is in reference to your Tuesday’s col-
umn “Pitt hoops won’t be denied anymore.” In it,
you say that our beloved Panthers should not have
lost a Big East game thus far this season. And to
make matters worse, you have the balls to say Pitt
will not lose another Big East game the rest of the
season.

I do agree that without the total collapse we expe-
rienced at the end of these games, we should have
won each of them. But let’s not forget that Pitt only
has seven scholarship players. And, Orlando
Antigua, who turns the ball over so many times, it
is almost as if he is a member of the opposing team.

All in all Mr. Duncan, I think you are a year
ahead of yourself with this article. Wait till next
year when we have a team that does not give fans

Mr. Warnitsky,

I have one question for you -— have you ever heard of the
word sarcasm? Any fool who has the capacity to dig a little
deeper than the actual black and white print can see that my
column is laced with sarcasm. A team doesn’t “ride the crest
of a one—game winning streak,” it rides a four—game streak.
There’s no streak in one. Furthermore, do you actually think I
meant that Pitt would “scorch” every Big East foe from here
on out? If Pitt wins any game, it doesn’t have the capacity to
“scorch” anybody. Pay attention to word choice, Mr.
Warnitsky, it may give you a little insight on that tricky con-

‘ cept of sarcasm (that was sarcastic for your information).

I don’t know where you came up with the idea of me
being “brain dead.” Especially when you essentially agreed
with what I was saying. I said that Pitt could conceivably be

undefeated in Big East play if they didn’t fold in sometime .

during the game. You agreed with that, remember? And basi-
cally, that was my main thrust of the column — so maybe
you should take a hard look in the mirror and ask yourself
who is brain dead.

just couldn’t capitalize.”

As is usually the case in
this series, Saturday’s game
featured an opportunistic
CMU squad taking an early
lead, and keeping the
Panthers always an arm’s
length away.

CMU opened up the scor-
ing with a goal by for-
ward Jim Buck just four
minutes into the first peri-
od, giving the Tartans their
first lead of the night.
Pitt defenseman Carter
Leonards tied it for
the Panthers with 8:28
remaining in the period, but
CMU took the lead again
with just 56 seconds
remaining in the opening
frame. .

In all, the Panthers
tied the game three different
times, but could never
steal the lead away from
the Tartans, who dictated
the momentum all night
long. V

What this game turned out

to be was little more
than another in a line of
big-game losses by the
Panthers. They know
that they will have to raise
their game to the level it
was at earlier in the year
if they hope to produce a
promising playoff run.

“This game was impor-
tant, but there’s plenty of
games left, so it’s not over,”
White said. “Right now, we
have to look at ourselves
and say ‘it’s time to get
serious.”’

The road to recovery

begins this Saturday,
when the Panthers
travel to Meadville to
face division rival

Slippery Rock. Pitt tram-

pled the Rockets
in both meetings last
yean

With four divisional

matchups remaining, and
resting in a fourth place
spot just three points out of
first, the Panthers hold the
key to their own postseason
fortune.

work than I’m doing now
[to go to the Olympic
Trials].”

With the support of
divers Jeremy McClean and
Chris Curry, coach Krug
feels he can do it.

“It is important for
John to have good divers
around him so he can get
better. He needs to have
competition to push him,
and these guys can do

~ that,” Krug said.

This past weekend
he competed against
Penn State’s l—meter
national champion, Chris
Divine. Soulakis came
in second, behind
Divine in both the l- and
3-meter.

“I’m friends with him.
I want to give him
good competition,”
Soulakis said.

That is exactly what
he did, and the better the
competition he has, the bet-

ter the diver he will
become.

It also helps that Soulakis
is comfortable with his
team.

“The team’s really
close, both the swimmers
and divers. We’re all
really supportive of
each other. I really like my
coach too. He has coached
three or four people that
went to the Olympics -
he’s well respected. I know
he has the knowledge to
help me because‘ he’s
coached people that are
way better than me,”
Soulakis said.

With the regular sea-
son coming to an end
soon, Soulakis will have
an evenitighter -schedule.
But Soulakis has the right
attitude to achieve his
goals.

“I love it here,” he said.

And he will probably love
it more after competing at
the NCAA meet this year.

That’s roughly the amount it

because he knows the chem-
istry of Inc, Orlando
[Antigua] and Jaime
[Peterson],” Gant said.
“He’s played with us all his
life, it’s a,posi_tive factor for
us.”

It is hard to look on the
bright side of a situation
such as the one McCullough
is in. Willard knows this and
realizes that with his star
player out, the team has suf-
fered.

“Right now we don’t have
the type of player that can
do what Jerry can. We have
nobody on the floor that is

capable of doing that right
now,” Willard said. “So of
‘course, Orlando would be
getting better looks at the
basket than he is getting
right now.”

The soft-spoken
McCullough looks forward
to the days when he can
return to the hardwood, but
in the meantime he helps the
team in any way possible.

One of those ways is offer-
ing advice and pointers to
the man who is filling his
spot, junior Andre Alridge

“When he comes to the
bench he'll ask me questions
sometimes or I’ll point out

some things [in his game]

that I see,” McCullough
said.

With the Panthers coming
Off of their first win in Big
East play, the season thus far
has been difficult, especially
for the seniors.

“It’s obviously a very dis-
turbing time for him, he’d
love to be out there,”
Willard said. “Jerry, Jaime,
Chris and Orlando are
friends and seniors, and I
think the fact that he is
unable to go out with them
has been kind of tough. He’d
like to have them go out on
a better note than they are

going out in.”

Gant agrees, saying that
McCullough has been going
through a hard time this year
because it would have been
his senior year.

“I guess he expected to go
out with us but I think he is
coping with it just fine right
now.”

With the adage that the
grass is always greener on
the other side, McCullough
and Willard are looking for-
ward to next year’s possibil-
ities because he will have a
full year of eligibility.

“I will be [fully recovered]
by next year and it’ll be a

different outcome,”
McCullough said. “We’ll
have a couple recruits and
the players we have now
will have a year under their
belts. I think we’ll be much
stronger.”

With 11 games remaining
in the regular season for the
Panthers, McCullough has
weathered a little over half
the season on the bench.

But to his teammates he is
still a vitale part of the
Panthers basketball squad.

“He’s still a part of us,”
Gant said. “If we lose, he
loses. He feels as much pain
as we dO.”
