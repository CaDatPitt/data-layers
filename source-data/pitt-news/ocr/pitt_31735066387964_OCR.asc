 ,, Gays and lesbians are an important part
 almost all Pitt students’ lives, according
to Mark Smith, president of the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance.

“Almost everyone is touched by and is
close to a gay or lesbian person in their
lives — whether they know it or not. It.
upsets me when students justassume that
all the people they associate with are
straight,” Smith said.

Though GALA was dismantled injanuary

Qof last year because the president
unexpectedly could not continue his duties,
a small group of students is now working
to bring it back. -A

“We are trying to provide a group where
gays and lesbians can feel better about
themselves and can realize that they are
human beings just like everybody else,”
Smith said.

GALA is open to both undergraduate
and graduate students and is planning

 social events throughout the year for its
members.

“I think that this year we’re even going
wwhave a gay dance,” Smith said.

A5»-~:%;'§)onald Ainslie, graduate student and

 member, said that these activities

-‘are especially important to members who
are under 21.

 

we’d like to offer a meeting place for
underage gays,” Ainslie said.

They have also been involved in AIDS

education and plan to continue their efforts.

“We viewed an AIDS education ﬁlm that
was" going to be shown in freshman
orientation classes this fall. It was very
homophobic and we expressed our
disapproval. I don’t think that they are
planning on showing it anymore,” Ainslie
said. , '

I Plans ‘for a safer sex workshop that will
focus on lesbians and AIDS are in the
works for this year.

“The workshop will deal with how safer
sex can be fun,” Ainslie said.

Smith says that violence against gays is
an issue that faces them every day, and
that the recent slaying of David Piergalski
is just an example of the fear and ignorance
that pervades our society.

“It hasn’t made me afraid. If I die because
I’m open about my sexuality, then I die,
but I’m not going to live my life frustrated
and hiding in the closet,” Smith said.

Even in its first weeks of activity, the
group has faced harassment and ridicule

‘ from other Pitt students.

“Last week I was putting up flyers in the
Towers Lobby for our first meeting and
two guys approached me and said, ‘That's
really sick.’ Then they followed me across

things,” Ainslie said.

Smith said that the mail the group receives
in its box on the ﬁfth ﬂoo-r of the William
Pitt Union has been stolen, tampered with
and covered with graffiti. They are now
going to put a" lock on the mail box. '

“Violence and prejudice [are] just based
on fear and ignorance,” he said. I

A recent addition to Pitt's non-
discrimination code which states that
students cannot be discriminated against
on the basis of sexual orientation provides
some recourse for victims of this type of
harassment. Ainslie said that it is basically
acknowledging that gays are deserving of

the rights that everyone else enjoys.

“Just like there are repercussions for
calling someone a nigger on campus, it is
now the same thing [if] someone calls you

. a fag,” Ainslie said.

The Affirmative Action office will deal
with each infraction on an individual basis
depending on the facts in evidence‘. GALA
will work this year to re—introduce a similar
clause to the city council, which voted /-
4 against it last year.

“This is an importantsymbolic statement.
My involvement in this group could hurt
my career— this gives me a legal recourse,”
Ainslie said. i

‘‘It’s‘ a little inconvenient, but that’s

Festival to show Ukrainian culture’

By Tracy Clouse ‘
for The Pitt News

Pitt’s practice of encouraging
cultural awareness will continue
this weekend as the university
hosts a showcase of Ukrainian
culture._

The eighth annual Pittsburgh
Ukrainian Festival, held Sept. 23
and 2/1, will celebrate the foods,
customs, crafts and talents of the
people of the Ukrainian Soviet
Republic.

“The primary objective of the
festival is to preserve and to
cultivate our rich cultural
heritage,” said Elizabeth Mitchell,

chairwoman of the festival.

“Through the process of sharing
our Ukrainian traditions we hope
to further enrich the multinational
American culture.”

6 Planned
Parenthood
  434-8971

The theme of this year’s festival
is the 175th anniversary of the
birth of Taras Shevchenko, the
poet laureate of the Ukraine.
Shevchenko was a Ukrainian serf
who poetically depicted the
struggle to free the Ukraine from
czarist rule.

According to Mitchell,
“Shevchenko is an excellent
theme for the festival because
most Ukrainians respect
Shevchenko as much as most
Americans respect Shakespeare.”

Because of its large Eastern

European population, Pittsburgh

is a natural center for the festival.
“Pittsburgh is a great center for
Ukrainians because of its 40
Ukrainian churches and many
Ukrainian functions,” said
Mitchell. “Pittsburghers are
wonderful; they support our

projects and festivals each year.”
The event will be housed in
the Commons Room of the
Cathedral of Learning, and will
include cultural and historical
exhibits, poetry readings, arts and
crafts sales, mini— performances
foods, which
Mitchell explained “are always a
favorite.” These attractions are
open to the public, free of charge,
from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on
Saturday, Sept. 23 and noon to 5

“A blast from the past...

Modernfasbion turns to Age of Aquarius for style

Mmmwmmuu

By Milt Klopfer
Staff Writer

On Oct. 16, radical ’60s activist
Bobby Seale, one of the famous
Chicago Seven, will go on trial
again. This time, the charge
against him will be the writing of
$11,000 worth of bad checks at
an Ohio barbecued rib cook—off.

The idealism and rebellious
spirit that made the ’60s such a
turbulent decade are gone. But
the look and the eagerness to
buy this look have made a
comeback and is still going strong.

“i can’t keep enough of it [’60s

by

clothing styles] in here,” said
Richard Parsakian, owner of Eons
Fashion Antique in Shadyside. “I
still have straight cut pants, while
a lot of people are into the baggier
look, but I’m waiting for a
resurgence.”

Parsakian divides the revived
’60s fashions into two separate
inﬂuences. One is the early sixties
“pre—Carnaby Street look.”
Carnaby Street is the area in
London where many of the day’s

(music, clothing and hair styles

started. Pleated skirts and baggy
pants _are some of the items that
typify this “prev-Beatles” period.

The “post-Carnaby Street look”
is inﬂuenced heavily by ’ the
designs of Mary Quant, innovator

of the miniskirt. A tight fit with .

dense fabrics and iridescent colors
were the fashion statements of
the later ’60s. It is this look,
according to Parsakian, that is
most popular with the younger,
high school and college—age
customers.

“This year vests are really
popular,” said Parsakian,
“Flowers and psychedelic, print
vests for guys and girls. Flowered
pants are getting hard to find.
Paisley neckties {are in style].

Animal [skin] prints on belts, coats
and blouses. Black and white
Op—art designs on T-shirts.”
Unisex dressing, according to
Parsakian, has also returned, with
women buying clothes originally
designed for men. “Something a
guy might have tried [on] will be
bought by a girl a little later, or a
girl and her boyfriend will buy
the same jacket and share it.”
The masculine look has made
its way into hair styles as well.
Paula Mercurio, owner of Pizzaz
hair styles on Fifth Avenue says
that many women are getting
their hair bobbed, or cut into a

modiﬁed pixie style. “The look is
clean, simple and short,” she said.
“A simpler, looser look, with low
maintenance, either really short,
or straight with perhaps a pony
tail in the back.”

Men who wear their hair long
aren’t necessarily in ’60s style,
saidiMercurio, and ’60s men can
usually be identified through their
clothes rather than their hair.

Manager of Avalon Vintage
Clothing Lynn Tomasits likes to
divide the ’60s style into mod and
hippie looks. “The mod style is
short miniskirts, straight dress

A Acting...

Getting into the problesnd js of  

l’ve always wanted to learn
how to act. Sure, I was in some
plays in elementary and high
school, but as a college student,
I have the chance to take some
acting classes and learn from the
pros in the theater community on
campus. I decided to start out
with -Introduction to Performance
since I had acquainted myself
with the theater last year in Intro-

‘ duction to Theater Arts. For the

first few weeks in Performance,
we participated in what are
known as “trust exercises.” These
take f ormxin a number of interest-
ing, varied and humiliating ways.
They started off simply enough;
we introduced ourselves, played

strange party games and con-

ducted seances in groups of six
or so. Then one day, we were

introduced to one of Pittsburgh’s
finest actors, who was going to
teach us the fundamentals of ‘
successful voice control and utili-
zation. ’

    

 

At first we all inhaled and

‘ exhaled together, hummed softly
and belted out “YO!” making
sure the sounds came from the
lungs and not the diaphragm.
After 10 minutes of “warming

up” our voices, we each struggled I

with “The sixth sheik’s sixth
sheep's sick” before running in
place and incanting “n-imminy
pimminy,” “Ah-uma" and the

popular “A-oha.” After that ses-
sion, we leaned on each other
(literally) for a few days, first in
couples, then in groups of three
and six or more. Each group was

L required to perform one of these I

balancing routines in front of
their fellow actors, and we had
spent about a week balancing
our partners’ bodies in many
varied and creative positions.
Only three weeks into the class,
I could feel my performing tal-

ents oozing from my pores, and ‘

I was hungry for more.

Well, Igot more... 15 hours

more to be precise, when I signed
on for the required time ‘dedi-
cated to “experiencing important
aspects of the theater.” You see,
each student in an introductory
theater» class must sign “The
Contract,” a document commit-
ting the person to 15 hours of
work in a chosen aspect of thea-
ter life. One could choose from

man Cate ories ran in from
f 8

operating the box office to paint-
ing sets. Some looked a little
stagnant (Box Office, Ushering),
and others had little description,

but looked promising neverthe- ‘

less (CityTheatre, PropConstruc-
tion Staff). I chose to work these
hours at the City Theatre in
Oakland, and my job was de-
scribed for me as “Assist with
running the theater, help with
preparing theater for perform-
ances. " I was anxious to see how
interesting and educationally
rewarding this experience would
be as I signed my contract (for 15
hours of unpaid work) with the
City Theatre in Oakland.

I couldn’t wait to get started.
What would I be doing? Maybe
I’d get to watch a real rehearsal,
construct a set, or even work as
an assistant to the play’s director.
On my first visit I realized that I
had gotten my hopes up just a
little when five minutes past my
arrival I was introduced to one of
the finest, most impressive and
comprehensive arrays of clean-
in aparatus that I had ever

    

seen, and was told to clean the
trash and broken beer bottles
from the theater's alley and weed
the frontandside of the building.
As I bagged the monumental

stream of garbage and leaves

behind the theater, _I was curious
about this job's potential as a
contributor to my acting -and
theater experience. I wondered if
Theater Arts and the Custodial

‘Arts were somehow related. I

wasn’t told much except where
the dumpster was, so I assumed

it was another strange but poten-.

tially rewarding acting drill. Per-
haps it was some sort of exercise
to subliminally shatter my com-
fortable world as an easy-going

_ student and introduce me to a

cruel, but new and unexplored
aspect of life. Besides, hard work
builds character.

Even though I was preoccu-

pied with ‘marvelling/ at the-

wondrous world of weeds that I
was yanking from the sidewalk
with my bare hands, I got the
strange sensation that I was in
physical pain. I couldn’t believe
that this completely humiliating
experience, was opening up
channels of my mind never be-
fore explored. Was I so in touch
with my body and emotions that
I could now not separate per-
sonal anguish from physical pain,
as many great actors seem to do

so well? -I realized that I had

gotten a little carried away when
I noticed the stream of blood
dribbling steadily from my fin-
ger, cut on a broken beer bottle
submerged in a larger clump of
the theater’s plant life.

After I had stopped the flow of
blood with a modest tourniquet,
I saw a friend of mine passing by.
Unfortunately, he saw me and
my embarrassment was then
complete. He asked what I was
doing weeding the City Theatre
with a bloody hand and a bad
attitude. I was stuck. How could
I explain to this stranger to the
world of performance that I was

rmance

being introduced to important
aspects of the theater? Of course

he had a field day with the facts}

that I had 14 more hours to go
and that I“wasn’t getting paid. I
tried to explain. the wealth of
knowledge Ihad already acquired
in that short first hour» (...with
great difficulty. 1 Perhaps I was
learning on a plane higher than

the everyday educational experi- 

ence, subconsciously somehow),
but I didn’t get through to him.
The conversation ended with a
sympathetic look on his face and
my tourniquet slipping off.

On my second day of work I
came in for a six hour ‘shift and
found myself padding a jet-black,

107-degree, 6 by 10 soundroorag,

with a single light bulb and a
small fan. After thatl put two
coats of paint on’ the building’s
small and windowless office,
gagging on fumes and sweating
profusely. It was an incredible
experience, being on what was
probably a set for a prison cell.
These people were clever. I felt
myself growing as an actor with
every swish of the broom, every
snap of the staple gun and every
stroke of my brush. '

Now that my range has broad-
enedin new and exciting ways I
never thought possible, I could
probably play someone as per-

sonally distant from myself as a —

janitor, with minimal effort. Who
knows what the future holds? I
still have seven hours to go on
my contract. Every day I thank
God that instead of being one of

the many ignorant simpletons out 0

there studying acting by being
behind the scenes of a play, I am
being educated and challenged
by renovating what has to be one
of the most decrepit buildings

still regularly inhabited by man. I

Sometimes it makes me feel guilty)
that I'm paying for all of this.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September 21, 1989

 

  Bush must see that legalization is the answer to drugs

Does the U.S. government really

Wiave the slightest idea what it is

doing in the so-called “Drug War?”
Well, let’s thinkpabout what has
been going on. First, Bush talks
to Congress and asks for cash,
$7.9 billion, to be exact. Second,
Bush talks to the taxpayers and
tells them to support his plan.
Third, Bush talks to the children
and tells themto stay away from

‘?.‘~drugs or they’ll get in trouble.

o

Democrats don’t think Bush’s plan
is enough, so they want to in-
crease the anti-drug budget to
$10 billion. Once again, it seems
that the lawmakers have gotten it
into their heads that the more
money you throw at a problem,
the quicker it will disappear.

Well, not so. So some genius.

came up with the idea to shoot
down suspected drug-trafficking
airplanes.‘ Drug czar William
Bennett isn’t sure if he likes that
idea. Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney hates the idea, although
I suspect more for the fear that
some gun-happy pilot will shoot
down the wrong plane and give

the military a bad name after it
has worked so hard to become
respectable. Many of the Joint
Chiefs are also afraid of becom-
ing embroiled in the Drug War
because of the chances of getting
involved in a military conﬂict
they are not sure will be sup-
ported by the American public.
Even so, the actions taken since
Bush has declared war on the
drug lords are questionable. An
emergency military aid package
sent to Columbia contained
mostly equipment that the gov-

I ernment couldn’t use against the

drug lords, although the drug
lords didn’t waste the opportu-
nity to blow up a U.S. military
transport. Bush’s desire to hire
more federal prosecutors and
build more prisons won’t make a
dent for several years, and there
aren’t even enough prisons to

 

hold all the murderers and rap-
ists, let alone house the occa-
sional dope smoker.

Sure, the drug lords are scared,
but so are all the government
officials in Columbia, Peru and
Bolivia. Not only that, but all of
the peasants who grow coca
leaves are miffed because the
U.S. wants them to stop and farm
something else. But as they point
out, nothing else has a market. So
the U.S. isessentially asking them
to starve to death. ‘In light of that,
Bush decided to offer the three
countries in question millions of
dollars in aid if they can get the
peasants to stop farming coca
leaves, but why should we force
another country to extort us?

-So what is a global power to
do? '

Legalization?

The argument for‘ legalization
is long and the benefits are sub-
stantial. First, drug-related crime
is immediately slashed dramati-
cally. No longer will local push-
ers be waging war over who can
sell on what block. Second, the

price of drugs drops to the level
where it is no longer necessary
for users to knock over 7-lilevens
to pay for their next high. Third,
drug rehabilitation becomes in-
expensive and widespread to the
point where anyone can get help.
Fourth, dmgs become safer be-
cause bad drugs would be elimi-
nated from the market. Fifth, the
U.S. has another source of in-
come.

is the US. ready for a “war?”
Without contest, the drug lords
are scum. But is it their fault they
found a market and filled it?» Is it
their fault U.S. citizens are stupid

. enough to buy drugs from push-

ers whose only concern is mak-
ing a buck, regardless of the
quality of the merchandise‘? Is it

-their fault pregnant women take

drugs and give birth to addicted
babies? President Bush would
have us believe it is. '

But wouldn’t it be more sen-
sible to take the business out of
the hands of‘ those who don’t

care and place it in a more re-
sponsible organization? A group
that wouldn’t cut cocaine with
laundry detergent or sell heroin
at 70 percent strength. l)oesn’t
logic seem to indicate that educa-
tion, and not suppression, is the
way to get drugs under control?
l)oesn’t anybody u nde rstand’ that
the legalization of drugs is not
allowing 7—l’.levens an extra aisle,
but rather regulation? Wouldn’t
twice as many drug rehabilitation
clinics be better than twice as
many prison cells?

Ofcourse, this all sounds crazy
and radical. llow could any self-
respecting nation legalize a sub-
stance that has ruined" so many

lives, that brings children into the _

world as addicts and that has
killed so many innocent bystand-
ers? I think it would be trite to
comment any further than to point
to alcohol and the Prohibition
Era. ‘

William Young is a columnist
for The Pitt ‘News.

Abortion politics —— should the people make the decision?

The Republican party won’t be

“sitting pretty for much longer.

 

With abortion regulations‘ to be
decided on a state by state basis,
Republican politicians willfinally
be required to pay more than lip
service to their stance on abor-
tion.

Since 1973, Republicans have ’

skillfully milked the passions of
the pro-life movement to further

' their own aims. A comfy bargain

was struck between the two: pro-

‘ﬁfe activists donated their time,

money, and (of course) ballots in
return for some “pro-life” politi-
cians. Both President Reagan and
President Bush kept their end"of
the bargain — each gave several
speeches on the sanctity of “pre—

' born life.” This traditional rhe-

torical support never got tough

The mini-van disgraces

Once upon a time, Bob and
Carol owned the highway in their
‘éustomized 1978 Dodge van — it
was a dream. Today, the two
travel down theewinding roads of
suburbia in their new mini-van to
take little Chad to violin rehearsal.
Oh, woe is me! The ravages of
yuppie-dom on the American
character.
The latest entry into the “Relics
of Modern Americana Lost For-
ever” is the American van. Oh, I

ﬁnow what you’re probably think-

i"""

ing: “But today we have the mini-
van which is so much better!”
Please! Today’s mini-vans aren’t
vans .— they are a collective
threat to the “Great American
Road.”

Ten years ago, our roads were
Iﬂed by those multi-colored
mayhems. You remember ‘em —-
those customized beauties with
fuzzy dashboards, air-brushed

enough to offend those Republi-
cans who didn’t support the
fanaticism‘ of the pro-life
movement. Webstervs. Reproduc-

. tive Health Services has opened

the door for modification and
possible elimination of abortion
rights. With_a divided population
waiting for these decisions, Re-
publican politicians currently in
office have realized that it’s‘ time
to take their proverbial thumbs
out of their asses.

In Pennsylvania, Auditor Gen-
eral Barbara Hafer (R) has a
somewhat more complicated
problem: she must win over the
public as well as the party
members upset by her 1ong-stand-
ing support of legalized abortion.
Barbara Hafer realized that
“[tlhere’s a way to solve this. Let’s
have a referendum. Put it on the

ballot and let the people decide.” ‘V

Hafer agreed to sign a bill limit-
ing abortions if it contained an
amendment calling for a binding
referendum on the issue. This
sounds like a reasonable pro-

murals of Atlantis (or some other
theme of the fantastic) and tinted
heart-shaped windows. Ah, those
were the days: black light was the
rage, cheerleaders were coming

' into vogue and Watergate seemed

like the greatest travesty of politi-
cal morals that could have possi-
bly surfaced. Today, it’s simply
the color black (it’s chic, we’re
told), men with polished teeth
and manicures are leading cheers
on sidelines everywhere and
Iranscam makes Nixon look like
a saint. And lastly, the great van
has been replaced with the mini-
van. A

The vans of the late seventies
and early eightieshad character.
Each one had its own statement
to make — and yet with diversity

abound, neither comfort nor the

tacky dedication to fun were ever
forgotten. Those vans, were
American—built and customized

u‘ ~:n.r \” s" .:,.:;‘.z".,.‘

posal to allow those directly af-
fected by the legislation to voice
their opinions, but anti-abortion
forces do not want to let the.
public decide. In fact, in. 1981
these forces nixed a similar refer-
endum proposal because they
expected defeat at the ballot box.

To keep the pro-life position

alive politically, direct public_

opinion cannot determine legis-
lation. A poll on abortion by The

New Yorle Times’ found that the «

nation is sharply divided: 49
percent back continued legality
but 39 percent want restriction.
Only nine percent agreed that a
total ban was necessary. What
does that mean for the pro-life
movement? They are a very vocal
minority, but a minority nonethe-
less. To further their position, this
minority must. oppose anything
remotely resembling government
by the people, for the people.
Fair representation of public

opinion would overwhelm the '

pro-life movement. Unless you
believe that a total ban is the only

solution, you are pro—choice to
some degree.

Because the pro-choice move-
ment was not as conspicuous as
the pro-life movement, politicians
doubted the political soundness
of adopting a pro-choice stance.
However, those who believed in

the right to choose abortion had

reasons for their relative political
inactivity. One reason was that
the law already reflected their
perspective. They didn’t need to
march outside abortion clinics or
turn the entire issue into a fantas-
tic three-ring‘ circus for some
cheap public relations.

There were other reasons why
the pro-choice movement re-

mained relatively quiet. No one

who claims to be pro-choice will
also claim that abortion is inher-
ently good. The decision to ter-
minate a pregnancy will always
be an unhappy one, but there are
times that it is preferable to the
alternatives. Defending a posi-
tion wholeheartedly when you
believe that no right answer ex-

ists isn’t easy. The message the
pro-choice movement hopes to
convey is a sophisticated one,

and it won’t fit on a bumper '

sticker or be easily contained in a
slogan. Adopting the pro-choice

 stance reflects the ability to reach ,

conclusions concerning the gray
areas of abortion, while the pro-
life movement acknowledges
only the black and white. The
Wall Street journal noted that
educated people are more apt to
say abortion should be a legal
option. Perhaps the overdone
escapades of the pro-life move-
ment were performed by indi-
viduals who were merely,unedu-
cated.

The message for politicians

. from both sides is clear. The pro-

lifers will support those who enact

anti-abortion legislation, but the

renewed vigor of the pro-choice
movement sends a different
message. Women take their rights
earned in Roe 1/. Wade very seri-

-ously, and they won’t relinquish

them without a fight.

the memory of the beloved '7 Os van

right here in the good ol’ U.S. of
A. Today, most mini-vans are
imported from you-know-where,
and have about as much charac-
ter as the cookie-cutter baseball
they play over there. T oday’s

mini-vans aren’t electric blue, nor
do they serve as canvases for air-
brush artists -— it’s simply white
or earth tone, maybe with an
occasional pinstripe. Excuse me
while I puke.

Perhaps I seem a little harsh in
my description of the mini-van. I
realize that a large percentage of

i this paper’s readership has a mini-

van in the family, including this
writer. To be fair, it should be
pointed out that there are several
instances in which a mini-van

41"-at

  

would just be so ideal. For in-
stance, a mini-van might be per-
fect if you needed to take the
local Demi Moore fan club to the
video store to rent The Seventh
Sign. —If your name is Corey and
you just got your license, you
could use Mom’s mini-van to
round up the sophomore class of
Wendlewood High to go out to
the mall and hang out.

Today, Americans seem to have
found several such reasons for
using the mini-van -— our high-
ways are full of these little para-
sites. Mothers have abandoned
the acceptable station wagon and
opted for the mini-van. A bas-
tardization of the once-great van,
today’s minis show their disre-
spect. While vans once blasted
such great music as Bob Marley
and the Wailers, today it isn’t rare
to hear a mini-van blaring Paula
Abdul or Tiffany on the way to

Skip’s cricket match. The Only
place one can really seethe great
vans of the past are in the nearly
forgotten films of the Seventies.
Don’t think you can just rush out
to Blockbuster Video and catch a
memory of the glory days gone

by -- films such as jail Bait -
Babysitter and Fandora Laura .

and the Cheerleading Massacre
are hard to find nowadays.
Something has to be done. We
cannot afford to lose such a vital
partof our national heritage. What
this writer suggests is nothing
less than a national presidential
commission — with the sole
purpose of preserving thevan.
Perhaps we could get Peter
Frampton to serve as spokes-
man. Or maybe even Ziggy Mar-

ley —- although he’d probably,

sell out and do a commercial for
Dodge's Caravan. Forget about

GRAND OPENING

Managing Editor

In the fifteen years since The
Exorcist graced the silver screen
and impaled itself in the hearts of
many, the word exorcism has not
only connoted evil, but also the
release of Satan’s grasp on the
weakened souls of men.

In The Pittsburgh Public
Theatre's production of Joe
Turners Come and Gone, a

similar exorcism occurs, and while i

religion is not the central element,
it is the same faith and spirit that
impassions religion that torments

,and exalts the players in this

dazzling production.

Written by August Wilson and
directed by Claude Purdy, Joe
Turner opens in the Pittsburgh
boardinghouse of Seth Holly
(John Henry Redwood) and his
wife Bertha (Olivia Williams). The

THE PIT!‘ NEWS,Thu1-sday, September 21, 1989

time is August 1911 and Seth is
raving to his wife about the
morning practices of one boarder
known as Bynum.

Seth curses the strange ritual
Bynum performs in their yard
involving ﬂowers, pigeons and
blood. Many of the blacks that
come and go through the
boardinghouse are kin of recently
emancipated slaves and as he is
from the North, Seth is rather
ignorant and at times
unsympathetic to the customs of
those from the South. It is only
when Rutherford Selig (LarryJohn
Meyers) enters to do business
with Seth that his attention is
pulled from Bynum’s harmless
oddities. v

Through his quick addition and
subtraction and shrewd business
haggling, Seth tries to separate
himself from the unfortunate and
uneducated. Redwood portrays

own pace.

Bynum, his ritual completed,
enters the Holly home. Roscoe
Lee Brown takes the role of
Bynum and glides effortlessly into
the part. He speaks comfortably
and confidently; his mannerisms
show compassion and sagacity.

Everyone needs work to eat
and Bynum explains his iﬁ
“bynum” people together, hence
his name. Rutherford’s work,
among other things, is “people-
ﬁnding. ”- It iustso happens Bynum
is searching for someone he refers
to as the “shiny-man.” A man

who gave Bynum his song. A -

song.

Bynum explains that his song
was given to, him by an apparition‘?
who led him through a mystical -.
journey among giant trees and
other unbelievable settings. And
the song, as the play shows, is
not so much a song as it is that
personal faith and spirit everyone
must be reminded of in order to
grasp an understanding of why
you exist and what keeps you
going.

Jeremy Furlow (Monte Russell)
emerges at the table. He is also a
boarder and a young man whoﬁ
desire for success is much the
same as Seth’s; however, his
naivete and shortsightedness
make him appear transient and
somewhat immature._ He is a
likable fellow nonetheless and
Russell plays him with youthful
tenacity. ‘

It is at this moment thattension
is thrust into the story when the
doorbell rings and Herald Loomis
Games Craven) and his 12-year—
old daughter (Di’RayJames) enter.

He is dressed in a largevblack ‘

overcoat and wearing a similarly
coloredhat that masks his eyes
and symbolically shadows his
expressions.

As described by Bynum, Hemid
is a man who has lost his song.
Reason —— he has been separated
from his wife for the past 1 1-odd
years and has been traveling the
road searching for her for the
past four. He and his daughter
need a place to stay.

In a gravelly voice best suited
for the character, Herald asks the
residents if they know his wife
Martha. Heads shake “no” and he
is advised to ask the “people-
finder” when he returns next
Saturday. Herald slowly wa
up to his room, the weight of __i5
anguish impeding every step and
every word.

Time passes and Bynum is
called upon by a young woman
(Tonya Pinkins) named Mattie
Campbell who is in search of her
lost lover. She explains that after
her two young babies died, her
lover Jack left her. Her request:
cast a spell to bind them back
together. '.

Here we are shown some of
the real magic that Bynum
possesses. He maintains that his
workings could bring Jack back
to her door, but if it is not part of
the music of their songs, _the
emptiness resulting, wpuld
override her present 1onelin&. ._

But when I come to Pittsburgh
it’s like coming home and it’s fun
to raise a little hell.”

Vincent’s style is unique in that
it pulls from a wide variety of

God instilled in Adam and Eve His ability to love, to
wholly commit oneself to another. This is how man is
made in God's own image. This is how man loves.

When you think about it, God knew how to love. He
gave up something that was very important to Him in
order for others to know His love. He gave up His Son,
His only Son. He gave Him up to suffering, to persecu-
tion, to death. This is true love. This is what true com-
mitment is all about; sacrificing what you want in favor

Howard Finster’s one man art show

“If God gives you a vision, get

Visionary folk art with a
religious message are the only
words to describe the amazing
“sacred art” of Howard Finster,
coming tomorrow to the Carson
Street Gallery.

Finster, a Baptist preacher from
Pennville, Georgia, has integrated
Christian messages and art to
’ - convey ‘his visions to us in a

manner ‘far more exciting than

sermons.

THE PI'l'l‘ NEWS, Thursday, September 21, 1989

 

By Joan Kane
Staff Writer

“Whatever you do, don't break
the D—string. We don’t have an
extra,” someone shouted as the
members of Fusebox . rushed
around preparing for another gig.

A cryptic warning perhaps, but
one that’s not completely

unfounded. It seems that guitarist/ .

vocalist John Young has
developed a habit of breaking his
guitar strings.

Sure enough, during that
evening’s show, a string snapped
on Young’s guitar——the D—string.

Instead of panicking or
stopping out of frustration, Andy
McDuffie (bassist/vocalist), Paul
Mosey (guitar) and Matt
Rutkowski (drums) continued to
rock on. In the meantime, Sean

Hally, guitarist for the local band

oi»

‘J

Bone of Contention, came to the
rescue with a spare D—string.

This might not appear to be
that big of a deal, but in essence,
the situation sums up what
Fusebox is all about.

In its short history (Fusebox
will be two years old in
November) the lineup has

changed, and inevitably so has its
sound. With the addition of Mosey,
the band feels that the music is more
energetic and less pleasant and
POPPY-
“We launch into a song and we’re
not real uptight about strict ways of
playing everything or having
something sound exactly the same
every time we play," Young said.
“We go on feel. It’s like if we were
having a good time and people are
having a good time and the amps
are getting louder and it gets distorted
and we’re screwing around. That’s
ideal. That’s cool.” A
Fusebox is hard pressed when it
comes to describing
its own sound. '
“It’s straight rock. It’s progressive,”
Rutkowski said.
“It’s raunch pop,” Young added.
“If someone said we were a cross

Dipper, The Jam and Bryan
Adams, I'd be really happy.

“I don't think we change
drastically from song to song,
but I think there is a definite
Fusebox sound,” said Young.
“There really is an
amalgamation of all of us
listening to tons of different
stuf_f and absorbing as much
as we can.”

Some of the band’s
inﬂuences are brought to. the
forefront by their choice of
covers. Even so, Fusebox adds
its own special twist to others’
music. .

“We try to learn the songs
our way,” Young said. “We’re
not totally butchering the song.
Like when we learned
“Uncomplicated” by Elvis
Costello, we changed the
rhythm of the chorus. I’d rather

Fusebox doesn’t rely only on
cool covers. Most of the material
they perform live is original. All
of the songs on their first release,
Live Better Electrically, were
written by band members, and
their

is a showcase of their latest
endeavors.

The guys insist that song writing
is a complete band effort.

“The songs really have been
collaborative,” Young said.
“‘Worthless,’ a song on the new
tape, is a total collaboration. Paul
and Andy had pretty much the
whole structure of the song
mapped out and half the lyrics
done. We were jamming on it
and it sounded good, but we had

finished the, lyrics and played
around with the bridge.

“It’s not like we all sit down
and say .‘let’s write a song
together,’ but gradually we all
put our part in. A lot of our songs
are like that.”

Fusebox hopes to gain more
exposure with the release of Bullet
through a Feather. According to
the band, it’s representative of
what they sound like andthey
hope people will notice it.

“This town is a place wanting
to happen music—wise, for young
people,” Rutkowski said. “It’s a
fun thing to do on weekends —
go see a live band. 'Ihere’s a lot
more good, creative marketable
talent that should be recognized
and we want to be a part of that.”

Fusebox will be performing on
Sunday, September 24 in ,“Raise

interesting to watch this

Finster

Continued from page 14
what has he profited?”

Pat McArdle, promoter of the
Finster show, has a videotape in
which Finster explains the
importance of his “sacred art.” “I
know the people who came to
church on Sunday would listen,
but they would forget what I said
after 15 minutes,” Finster says.
“Now my messages are written
on my art. Now these messages
will last a hundred years, a
thousand years.”

Finster has messages for
everyone, including people who
literally watch their lives pass by.

A spectacular piece is a -1953
television which is completely
covered in messages: “Most
everything on earth is on TV.
Yes, you can learn how to poison
your family to collect insurance.
You name it and you can see
how it’s done. Hopefully someday
they will change TV teaching to
only proﬁtable programs when

they find the world sinking in L

their own front door.” Perhaps
Jim Bakker should have noticed
another of _the messages, “I am
preaching on this TV and it’s not
even plugged in.”

Finster’s art is not always so

serious. It is cheerful and
humorous as"we1l. Many of his
works are filled with comical
animals, smiling clouds, and his
unique ﬁngerprint faces. One
such piece is a life—size model of
a prehistoric bird, whose head
twists off to reveal a whiskey
ﬂask in the neck.

Not surprisingly, this man of
visions has found commercial
success. Finster designed the
album covers of R.E.M.’s
Reckoning and Talking Heads’
Little Creatures. Even Coca—Cola
has cashed in on Finster’s talent.

messages such as, “Millions of

According to McArdle, Finster
“uses his profits only to expand
and improve his Paradise
Garden.”

Pennville, Ga. is a bit too long for

Vans.

Continued from page 5
“Save the Whales,” let’s “Save the
Wailers.” And the van.

Today, in the Bush Era, it
appears as though Americans are
returning to recent nostalgia. Why
not show the same enthusiasm
towards restoring the '70s and
the forgotten van? Bell—bottoms,
polyester leisure suits... and vans!
Heck, I’d even take a little disco

back if it meant that the Covergirls I

and Richard Marx would vanish
from the airwaves forever.

For the van to regain its place

in American poop (uh, I mean,

pop) culture, we must use the
media effectively. Perhaps the
producers of Bacle to the Future3
could replace thejDeLorean with
-— you guessed it— a customized
beauty. Maybe Absolut Vodka
could try a picture of a customized
van with a tinted window shaped
like a vodka bottle. “Absolut Van-

ity” the caption could read. In
fact, President Bush might might
replace his drab limo with a
twenty-foot van. What body shop
wouldn't love in the opportunity
to air—brush a mural of the White
House on it, with Barbara ﬂying
above, depicted as Aphrodite.

* Excited about the prospect? Go
not gently into the good night ———g
dream up ways to eradicate the
van’s plight! Mini-vans have
polluted the roads long enough,
and it's about time we restore the
customized craft to its original
glory. One day soon, the
American road may once again
delight in having oil dripped on
it by real motoring machines...

The thought is simply “Van—
tastic!” .

lines and bold colors. The hippie
style is ratty jeans, vests, Indian
or other ethnic fabrics in dresses
or shirts.” The serape, a loose
Mexican pullover shirt, is a
standard among “hard-core” ’60s
men.

According to Tomasits, very
few seek to dress entirely like a
person living in the ’60s. “A
customer buying just one or
two ’60s items is very common,
with few taking the next step.”
She describes a style as more of
a “retro-’60s” look

But what about the values?
The peace sign has become
ubiquitous once again, on
jewelry, tie—dyes and grafﬁti, but

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, September 21,1989

is it still a symbol of protest?

Parsakian doesn't believe it
is. “The peace sign has become
sort of like Warho1’s Campbell’s
soup cans. [In the ’60s] it was
easy to jump on the
bandwagon. When you don't
have a general cause to join,
it’s a lot harder.

"People today wearing peace
signs are just like people
wearing the cross. You don't
have to have lived 2,000 years
ago to wear a cross.”

T omasits sees the renewed
popularity of the peace sign as

A superficial without any true

understanding of what’s wrong
with the world. “But the young

. protest or

 

want peace and freedom and at
that age you’re just learning
about the world. It’s hopeful.”

If the ’60s look is any sort of
rebellion, says
Tomasits, it is “a rebellion against
the conservatism of the past 10
years. And it looks neat.”

Looking neat, then, is the key
to the whole resurgence.
According to Paula Mahoney,
owner of Club. Anonymous, a
vintage clothing store on
Morewood Avenue, “Whatever
era you’re in , fashions are going
to go back 20 or 25 years [for
inﬂuence]. Twelve years ago the
‘40s were popular. Now it’s the
’60s.”

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Thursday, September 21, 1989

Beauty and business

By Jerome Lehmann
Staff Writer

Some say that it is not how
you look that is important, it is
what you are inside. According
to Pitt researchers, they might be
lying.

A study conducted by the

Joseph M. Katz Graduate School

of Business found that handsome
men tend to draw higher starting
salaries, and once hired, good-
looking men and women
continue to make more money
than their less attractive
counterparts. '
“Traditional psychology
literature tells us that looks have
little effect on salary," said Irene
Frieze, professor of psychology
and business administration. “We
found that these laboratory studies

did not hold up in the real world,
using real people and real
salaries.”

A .team of three graduate
students and a management
consultant were asked to look at
the pictures of Pitt MBA graduates
who were clad in business attire,

explained Josephine Olson,

associate professor of business
administration and co—author of
the study. The team then rated
the facial attractiveness of each
person on a scale from one to
ﬁve, with ﬁve being the most
attractive. 1

Questionnaires were sent to
2,047 MBA graduates from 1973
to 1982, and 1,433 responses were
acquired. Questions posed dealt
with work experience, current
and starting” salaries and sex,
height and weight. The study

used only 737 former students
presently in managerial positions
(452 men and 285 women) who
also had their pictures on file.
“The attractiveness ratings were
then matched to information on
the careers of these MBAs
collected from this larger group
of MBAs,” the professors said.
For the statistical analysis, a
computer formula was derived
which . showed how, an

. individual’s attractiveness rating‘

related to his stipend. Factors
such as work experience and
salaries adjusted for inﬂation were
compensated for in the formula.

_ According to the report, “each
unit increase in a man’s average
attractiveness rating tended to
raise his annual starting salary by
$1,100.” In other words, a man
with a rating of four earned an

Attractiveness a factor in employment

average of $2,200 a year more
than a man with a rating of two.

“Unlike men, attractive
women did not benefit as much
from their looks until after being
hired,” added Dr. Olson.

‘ The researchers also
discovered that looks seemed to
matter more for later salaries than
initial ones. They hypothesized

that this might occur due to
personnel offices’ widespread .
avoidance of using stereotypes

about women. ,
Once hired, each one point

increase in a man or woman's I

attractiveness rating translated to

almost $2,000 a year more in pay. I

The professors concluded,
our data supports earlier
stereotype research that ‘beautiful
is good,’ even for managers."

“PUT VS. SYRACUSE at PI'I'I'STADIUM

 P:f,©

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1989 7 P.M.

  

gae

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

When you think of football at
the University of Pittsburgh, you
have to think of its rich tradition.
In fact, Pitt’s tradition is one of the
main reasons Head Coach Mike
Gottfried came to Pitt.

A memorable tradition such as
Pitt’s is almost impossible to build
without the help of rivalries. Think
of past great games in college
football, and almost all of them
involve games between rivals.

Pitt’s most notable rivals over
the years have been Penn State,
Notre Dame and West Virginia.

Penn State is obviously Pitt’s
 biggest rival. If you don’t believe

that, listen closely in the Pitt student
I.) section when the band plays Pitt’s

fight song. Pitt has dominated that
rivalry over the past few years,

winning the last two match-ups,
and three of the last five.

West Virginia is probably the
next biggest rivalry because they
are so close. Pitt lost last year’s
contest, but won the previous
two. Over the last five years their
record is even at 2-2-1.

Notre Dame obviously beat Pitt
last year, since they were
undefeated, but Pitt beat the Irish
the two previous years. Those
three meetings were the only times
Pitt and ND,met in the last five
years. ,

Why stress the last five years?,
you might be asking. Well, as
you’ve read, Pitt beat all their
rivals at least twice in that span.
But there is another team that Pitt
is slowly building another rivalry
with: the Syracuse Orangemen.

The only difference with this
rivalry is that Pitt hasn’t beat

Syracuse in the last five years. Pitt
is 0-5 against the recently improved
Orangemen.

The only reason Syracuse isn’t
considered one of Pitt’s top rivals
is that they don’t have as rich a
tradition as the other schools. If
the trend over the last five years
holds true on Saturday, when Pitt
and Syracuse meet at Pitt Stadium,
watch for the Orangemen. to
become Pittfs fourth big rival.

Syracuse head coach, Dick
MacPherson, is “proud, but
humble” about the present five-
year trend. He added that it hasn’t
been on his mind much.

“I don’t think it’s as much a
concern of ours as it is of Pitt’s,
they’re the ones with the problem,
notus,” said MacPherson. “I would
like to keep it going and I’m sure
Pitt would like to stop it.”

As far as Pitt center Dean

Panthers facing first top-twenty challenge

Heidi R. White/The Pitt News

The Panthers hope to stand up to the challenge 01 beating eleventh-ranked Syracuse for the ﬁrst time in five years’

Caliguire is concerned, the trend
is on his mind, but he's not going
to change his playing style to try
to beat them this year. «

“You would really like to beat
these guys; I haven’t beaten them
since I’ve been here, and I’m real
excited to have another chance at
them,” saidCaliguire. “Yes, I want
to beat them before I get out of
here, but it docsn’t come into the
factor of our play, though. I’m not
thinking ‘I want to go out there
and rip their heads off’ or anything.
It’s just a real big game and I’m
looking forward to playing them”

A lot of people are looking
forward to the game, as a crowd
of over 50,000 is expected in Pitt
Stadium Saturday night. And why
not? Both teams are 2-0, with Pitt
beating Pacific and Boston College
and Syracuse defeating Temple

and Army. lt’s not extremely often
that two nationally ranked teams
meet each other during the regular
season. However, the No. 11
ranked ()rangemen and No. l/l
ranked Panther game is not yet
sold out.

“I had no idea it wasn’t a sell
out,” said MacPherson. “Quite
honestly, it helps us if it isn’t.
There won't be so many people
cheering for Pittsburgh."

The people who are there will
see some great match’-ups, the
most notable being Pitt’s big—play

defensive line against Syracuse’s
offensive line, who many think is
the best in the country.

'lheir big offensive line, which -

averages about 285 pounds, will
be blocking for a wishbone
offense that often uses the
quarterback option. Gottfried said
the wishbone offense, which
features three running backs in
the backfield, often causes
problems for many defenses.
“They are a very strong option
team. But they aren't strictly
option, they do a lot of things
with their defense,” said Gottfried.

Starring in that offense is
running back Michael Owens,
who has 181 yards rushing so far
for the Orangemen.

“He’s really an outstanding
player. He’s a back that is capable
of breaking loose at all times,”
said Gottfried. “I think he's one of
the premier backs in the East.”

Pitt will counter with an
outstanding tailback of their own
in Curvin Richards. Richards has
155 yards running for the Panthers
so far in 1989.

Another great match—u p will be
the two quarterbacks. Pitt’s Alex

Van Pelt ranks as the sixth most
efficient passer in the NCAA with
a 182.5 rating. He has completed
26 of 35 passes so far for 357
yards and three touchdowns.
Syracuse counters with Bill
Scharr as the field general. Scharr
is having an exceptional year as

, well. He’s completed 30 of his 45

pass attempts for,34S yards.

Scharr likes to pass to wide
receiver Rob Moore, who has
nine receptions for 182 yards
already. Also look for wide
receiver Rob Carpenter, who has
eight catches.

Van Pelt usually looks to his
wide receivers as well. Hedi;
T uten led the Panthers in receiving
with six for 111 yards.

But defense will most likely be
the big story.

Syracuse’s offense ﬂoundered
last week in a 10-7 victory over
Army, but their defense secure"?
the win.

“We did an outstanding job
against Army’s wishbone. I
honestly believe it was the best
job we’ve ever done against the
wishbone,” said MacPherson.
“But we really laid an egg of

offense, which was disappointing .. -I

to us.”

Syracuse’s defense will be lead
by outside linebackers Dan Bucey
and David Bavaro. Bavaro leads
the Orangemen in tackles with
23 and Bucey is third with 16.
Strong safety Tim Sandquist is
second with 17 tackles.

“If you take a look at our stats,

and the way we play defense),

there hasn’t been a year that our
outside linebackers haven’t been
1-2 in tackles,” said MacPherson.

Pitt has two top—notch outside
linebackers of their own. Ricardo
McDonald and Curtis Bray are
considered two of the best in th;.-
country. McDonald has 10 tackles
and Bray has eight. '

Marc Spindler, Tony Siragusa,
Craig Gob and ‘Prentiss Wright
lead the Panthers in tackles with
15, 14, 13, and 12 respectively.
Alonzo Hampton has two
interceptions for Pitt, both coming
last week against Boston College.

But look for the big plays to
play a major part in this game. Pitt
had a blocked field goal, a 60
yard punt return for a TD by
Henry Tuten, a 58 yard fumble
return for a TD by Carnell Smith,
four interceptions, 10 sacks, and
three fumble recoveries.

Syracuse is not as reliant on the
big play, as they have just two

sacks, two interceptions, and 

fumble recovery

In a game that could be decided
by just one big play, it may look
like it could go in Pitt's favor, but
remember Pitt has had trouble
with the Orangemen over the last
few years.

Panther Notes: Pitt's kicking
game has been infallible so fit
this year; Ed Frazier is 8-8 on
extra-point attempt and 3-3 on

field goals. Brian Greenﬁeld is

averaging 55.2 yards per punt.
Pitt defensive lineman Carnell
Smith, who returned a fumble for
a touchdown and recordeé/’ a

safety against Boston College, 

was named the Sports Illustrated
Defender of the Week.

THE Pl'l'I' NEWS, Thursday, September 21, 1989

The answer is: or staﬂ writer who com predict tbefuture

 Chris Kuzneski

Staff Writer

When you picked up today’s
paper, the first thing that probably
came to mind was: who is Chris
Kuzneski, and what the hell is he
doing predicting scores in a
periodical as informative as The
Pitt News?

Well, since this isn’t a
philosophy lecture, answering the
question “who is Chris Kuzneski?”
seems a little out of the ordinary.
The second question, however,
is valid; therefore, I will briefly
list some of my credentials.

Over the past few years, I have
successfully predicted some of
the biggest upsets in the world of

 sports. I picked the Los Angeles

Dodgers over the Oakland A’s in
last year’s World Series. I
envisioned the Kansas Jayhawks’
victory over the Oklahoma
Sooners in the NCAA Basketball
Championship, and I foresaw
Rocky Balboa’s victory over
Clubber Lang in their second
championship fight.

Now that my gift of foresight
has been publicized, here is an
advance look at this weekend’s

A  «gesults.

Pitt 21, Syracuse 17

A balanced offensive attack
will enable, the Panthers to beat
thehigher-ranked Orangemen in
this pivotal Eastern match-up.
Even though Syracuse has the

best offensive line in the country,
their offense will be virtually
ineffective when Pitt stacks their
defenders to stop the Orange’s
potent running game.
Penn State 27, Boston
College 21
Joe Paterno’s posse isn’t as bad
as it looked against Virginia, and
it isn’t as good as it looked against
Temple. Look for a sloppy game

   

to be played between these two
mediocre teams with an Eagle
mistake leading to a Penn State
victory.

West Virginia 38, Louisville
21

Louisville is steadily improving
under the guidance of Howard
Schnellenberger. The
Mountaineers, however, are an
established power, and they will

embarrass the Cardinals with an
offensive barrage. Major Harris
looked like a god last weekend,
and this trend will continue.

Notre Dame 24, Michigan
State 14

After their victory at Michigan,
it is apparent that QB Tony Rice
leads a one~dimensional Irish
attack. Ict’s face it, Notre Dame’s
offense relies on Rice more than

the entire country of China.
Michigan State’s defense, on the
other hand, depends entirely on
LB Percy Snow; therefore,

television viewers can ignore 20,

of the 22 players on the field and
still see all of the action.

Last Week 6-7

Season 1 7-9

What a lousy last week! Time
to redeem myself. ,
Minnesotaat Pittsburgh: The
Vikes let me down lastweek, but
they’re playing the Steelers this
week. I’ll stick with the Vikings
by 20 or so. .
Buffalo at Houston: The Bills
aren’t playing good football and
they’re boring the hell -out of
people in the process. Go. with
Houston, who's bearable.
Atlanta at Indianapolis: The
Colts need this win to avoid going
0-3 and prove they are a legitimate
playoff team. They will get it.
Chicago at Detroit: I wanted

. to count the Bears out of it this

year, but I they won’t let me.
Detroit and Barry Sanders won’t
be able to run against the Bears
big line. Take Chicago.

New Orleans at Tampa Bay:
The Saints are desperate for a win
after losing to Green Bay last
week, especially since the rest of
their division is winning. The
Saints will beat the slightly
improved Bucs.

Phoenix at NY Giants: The
Cardinals are I surprising
everybody this year by starting 2-
0. The Giant’s record will stay

unblemished,though.
San Francisco at
Philadelphia: Should be the best

game of the week. Both teams
are 2-0, and are in mid-season
form. I hate to go against Randall
Cunningham and his 400+ yard
passing game last week, but the
49’ers will win.

Seattle at New England: Both
teams let me down last week and
lost to weaker opponents. Seattles
the weaker opponent this time,

but I'll go with the Pats in a close
one.

Washington at Dallas: This
rivalry deﬁnitely lost something
over the past few years. The
Redskins are still good, but the
Cowboys crashed somewhere
along the line. The Redskins.

Green Bay at LA Rams: No
the Pack is not back for the 100th
time. The Rams, big. 0

Kansas City at San » Diego:
McMahon is almost bearable
playing at San Diego and is ﬁnally
putting up good numbers,
something he never did at
Chicago. One big difference
though, he won at Chicago.
Kansas City.

NY Jets at Miami: Tough one
to call. Flip a coin. It came up
tails, so I’ll go with the ‘Phins.

LARaiders at Denver: Denver ,

has looked impressive so far and
the Raiders have looked O.K. Go
with John “Mr. Ed” Elway and his
team.

Predictions are common sense
decisions, especially when it
comes to football. So all this time
that our illustrious sports staff
spends up in the newsroom
deliberating over who’s got the
best passing average and who
was drafted in what round is all
nonsense...plain nonsense.

Men don’t win games; helmets,
insignias, and city locations do.

Falcons and Colts: You ’ve got
a bird fighting a young horse and
it would be very easy to say the
colt would step on the falcon, but

i remember the bird can ﬂy and

falcons are generally pretty scary.
(Besides the blue and white
combination on Indianapolis’s
helmet is utterly ghastly). I give it
to the Falcons by a wing.‘

Bills and Oilers: Here we have
a man playing against an
inanimate object so it wouldn't

‘ be fair to judge on those premises.

The Bills have red helmets and
Oilers have white. When you’re
mad you see red and if you see
red all the time then you’re
probably borderline psychotic or
really mean. I’m giving it to the
psychos from New York, Bills by
a scream. ‘

Bears and Lions: Ooh, this is
a tough one to call. Bears and
lions are both notoriously nasty
critters. Chicago is red and black
and Detroit is silver and blue.
Hmmm... when in doubt go with
the more morose. I’m giving it to
the Bears by a growl. '

Vikings andsteelersz I’d really
like to go with the hometown
team, but the Vikings are so much
more mean and scary. Besides,
they are adorned with horns and
purple is my favorite color. The
Vikings by an org!

Saints and Buccaneers: New

Orleans doesn’t exactly breed or

harbor what I’d call saints, did
you see the movie The Big Easy?
It seems as though Tampa Bay is
a little more honest about football.
I also like the white and orange
combination, its very summery
like Florida. (My sister used to
live in Florida). I‘m going with
the Buccaneers by a mighty yell
of victory.

Cardinals and Giants: Here
we have another bird but it’s

A pretty little and a giant is generally

a person of a certain hugeness.
However New York has no

« creativity when designing their

head gear and football is much
more than hitting people, it’s a
mild form or repressed emotion.
I’m going with the sensitive and

I light Cardinals by a tweet.

49ers and Eagles: San

,Francisco is way too hot and is

too overrated when it comes to
their version of pasta and rice
(Rice—Roni). Again, where is the
creativity in using a number? Is
that how many people are on the
team? Then you have the mighty
bird of freedom who would
certainly outﬂy anyone from San
Fran. I'm going with the Eagles
by the red, white, and blue. (Philly
has great subs too.)

Seahawks and Patriots: This
is a very easy one. Seattle is much
more scenic and beautiful.They
have a huge phallic thing called
the Space Needle in the middle of
the city and I have a friend who
lives there. New Englanders say
“seltzer” when they mean “soda”.
Plus we all know the birds are
going to dump on these guys
who don’t pronounce their R's.
I’m giving it to the Seahawks by
a loud and malicious caw!

Redskins and Cowboys: Well

’eers chomp their way through cupcake schedule

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

The 1989 West Virginia
Mountaineer football guide makes
proud reference to last year’s
squad as the one responsible for
accomplishing the “ﬁrst unbeaten,
untied regular season in history.”

History of the school, that is.
Other teams in college football
history have pulled off the same
coup. The only catch: the 1988
‘Eers and that notorious 1984
BYU national champion had
easier times doing it than anyone
else in history. ﬂ

Aside from Pitt, recent—toughie
Syracuse, Penn State and Fiesta
Bowl opponent Notre Dame,

West Virginia scheduled itself into
dealing with a murderers’ row
known as Bowling Green, Cal
State-Fullerton, Maryland, Virginia
Tech, East Carolina, Boston
College, Cincinnati and Rutgers.

Translation: “It's the national
championship game, for all -the
marbles, Notre Dame vs. West
Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl. Happy
Jan. 2 everyone. I'm Dick Enberg
along with my partner Merlin
Olsen, and the excitement
building up to this game has. ...”

West Virginia is pulling off one
of the great con jobs in the history
of sports. .

What the Mountaineers search
for are national credibility and
recognition and bowl bids, and

they were named after, and that

will put the Buckeyes in a sticky

situation.
Michigan 28, UCLA 17
The Wolverines will rebound
after a disappointing loss to Notre
Dame and defeat the Bruins rather
handily. UCLA is a talented squad,
but their offense relies too heavily
on freshman Bret Johnson.
Kentucky 21, Alabama 16
Upset, of the week! The
Wildcats return 14 starters and
many backups from last year’s
squad. The Tide, however, has
no depth at all. (Get it?)
Clemson 38, Maryland 7
A few years ago, this game
would’ve decided the ACC.title.
Then again, I think Sophie Masloff
was a Towers cafeteria worker a

few years ago. Things sure

change, don’t they?
Arizona 22, Washington 13
If you read last week’s column,
you’ll probably remember that
Arizona was picked to upset
Oklahoma. * Sure enough, it
happened. Stay with a winner,
and take the ‘Cats.
Florida State 49, Tulane 10
The Seminoles are led by QB
Peter Tom Willis, who replaced
last year’s QB Chip Ferguson.
Until Coach Bobby Bowden signs
a QB with an athletic name, FSU
will be unable to win the big
games. Tulane, however, isn’t a
big game. 1
Army 38, Wake Forest 2
The Cadets nearly knocked
off Syracuse last weekend, and
appear to be a powerful team. In
fact, too powerful for a team like
the Wake Forest Demon Deacons.

yet they are unwilling to pay for
it by scheduling top teams for
meetings on the football field.
Don Nehlen, do you recall ever
hearing any of these truisms
before? .
Nothing from nothing leaves
nothing.
You can’t always get what you
want. _
You can’t get something for
nothing.
Everybody loves somebody
sometime.
~ And this year’s schedule, aside

from South Carolina, Pitt, Penn

State and Syracuse entraps .

BALL STATE AND MARYLAND
AND LOUISVILLE AND VIRGINIA
TECH AND CINCINNATI AND

BOSTON COLLEGE AND
RUTGERS. YEAHHHH, GO GET
‘EM, ‘EERS!! A BOWL BID! YEAH!
NATIONAL RECOGNITION!
YAYYY! RESPECTABILITYU YE

Pipe down, kid.

So far WVU has beat up on
three of their lesser opponents:
Ball State, Maryland, and their
latest bashing of South Carolina
45-21. Congratulations, 3-O,
without really playing anybody
yet.

Now, their football team isn’t
the only school organization that
seeks the sacrificial lambs of the
college sporting world. The
basketball team, under
direction of Gale Catlett or Veal

the

Cutlett — something like that — A

pulls off a similar stuntlyear in
and year out. Schedules wimpy’
teams, rounds up 20+ wins, slips
into the NCAA tournament, then
gets blown out when the first real
team steps into the ring.

WVU uses cheap wins in kissing
up to the pollsters. When UCLA
or Auburn or Georgia or Michigan
are on the football team’s
schedule, then A maybe some
respect will be sent its way, win
or lose.

But until then: In other scores,
West Virginia leads Texas A,E,I,O
8: U 53-17 early in the third quarter
at Mountaineer Field.

Big deal.

outrun a pirate, but the
