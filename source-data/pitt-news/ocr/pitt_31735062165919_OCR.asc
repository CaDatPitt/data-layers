VLADIMER SPOLSKY, at the 12th Annual Student Dental Asso-
ciation Day, demonstrates anesthetic injuestions.

Student clinics‘, commercial exhibits, a film, and a speech
by a noted dentist marked last Wednesday’s 12th Annual
Student American Dental Association Dayrheld in Scaife Hall.

The meeting, sponsored by the American Dental Assoc-
iation, was part of a nationwide program presented in dental
schools. Acquainting student, dentists, members of the Odon-

tological Society of
Pennsylvania,‘ alumni, predental
students and ‘other members of
the health profession with the
newest developments and tech-

niques in dentistry was the aim’

of S. A. D. A. Day.

The morning session of the

meeting at 10 a.m. in Scaitfe Hall
Auditorium was opened by presi-
dent-elect of the Pennsylvania
Dental Association, Dr. Jay Har-
old Eshleman. Speaking on “Den-
tistry in Our Changing Society,”
Dr. Eshleman stressed that “the
dental profession must admit to
the new developments in society
by becoming better informed and
by going for the principles 0
public interest.” -
Communication Needed

He further pointed out the
needs for better layman—dentist
communication, for improved
measures to test the full potential
of dental school applicants, for
additional funds for dental stu-
dents, and for well—trained dental
nurses to assist dentists. Dr.
Eshleman concluded, “What den-
tistry needs today are leaders.”

The third ﬂoor of Scaife Hall
was the scene of the afternoon
session. From 1 to 5 p.m., 15
student clinics, five dental as-
sistant clinics, and 24 commer-
cial exhibits demonstrated tech-
niques and new advances of
dentistry. In addition “The

Deferred
Rushing  
Defeated

The proposal for a deferred
rushing program to be initiated
next year by all fraternities was
turned down last Wednesday eve-
ning at the regular Interfrater-
nity Council meeting held in 306
SU.

Speaking 'in favor-of the pro-
posal, Howard Paterson stated
that a deferred rush would do
much to..increase the number of
pledges attracted each year.

_ David ,Yudin, however, said
that if IFC did adopt the new rush
program, it _would suffer a ﬁnan-
cial loss due to the fact that sen-
iors would not be. permitted to
in‘ their last year nor
would freshmen-be as inclined to
rush in the second trimester as in
the first. ' .

A - Penn State Example -

The effect of the deferred rush
program now in operation at Penn
State wasdiscussed, _and after-
wards, IFC voted to"continue op-
erating under. thetwo trimester
rush system’ instead of accepting
the new program.

The council also elected ﬁve

judges to the, IFC Judicial
Commission. S e n i o r justices

selected were Ken Miller of .

work, Sonata in E Flat, for ﬂute

vibrant spontaneity in a very
tasteful treatment by Mellors and

in emotion with her ﬁne effort.
The two German arias by Handel
were done well though at times

was somewhat constrained.

that was extended them at the
purchase date, but the waiting-
time period will be closer to ten
years before Forbes Fieldis torn
down.

Chancellor Litchﬁel_d, how-
ever. is anxious to begin con-
struction of schools of law, edu-
cation, business administration,
public and international affairs,
social work, and library science
on that property.

“From our point of view,” he
said, “a new home must be found
for the Steelers and Pirates at_
the earliest possible time.”

Financing Disputed

The long delay has been caused
mainly because Dr. McClelland
and the Pirates’ Galbreath do not
agree on the ﬁnancial plan for the
new stadium. ,

“I can’t see the public having
to foot the bill,” asserted ‘Mc-
Clelland, when interviewed by
The Pitt News. “Why should the
taxpayers be called "upon to as-
sume the whole risk. There’s

A been a lot of favor for my stand.
I’ve been getting a lot of letters’
backing me up.”

Galbreath meanwhile cannot

‘ forsee a plausible private ﬁnanc-

ing of theproject.
-I Dr. Mcclelland said 'he has
talked to people in St. Louis
about a $52 rnillion stadium that
they are building and found that
“not a nickel of that is public
money.” , ‘
“There.-are just as many civic-
in St.
Louis,” he said. “If people think
it’s so critical to our economy —
which I think it is —- they’ll pay
to see the Pirates and Steelers
stay here. I’d hate to see them
leave Pittsburgh.” -
One of the Reasons 3
The University itself is. one of
the reasons that the City cannot
possibly ﬁnance the project, ac-
cording to ’McC1elland, an alum-
nus_ and former member of the
board of trustees ‘here for 16
years. ' A"
“Pitt is causing us a. lot of}
trouble — taking a lot of tax-
property off the tax rolls,” he
said. “They’re helping to put
Pittsbrugh in a bind. That’s why
we’re in. onebhell of a straight.

We’ve lost" a lot of revenue out
here in Oakland. But, of course,
it’s good that you now have
so many student facilities that
you didn’t have when I Went
there.”

Commissioner Mcclelland says
the Pirates have emphasized their
oﬁer to loan $2 million toward the
estimated $45 million that the
Stadium Corp. needs.

“A Good Deal”

“And they’ll get all that back
at ﬁve-and—a-half‘ per cent inter-
est,” said McC1el1and.‘ “That’S'a
good dea. Especially since Pitt

in the first place‘. If you’re even
in Mr. Galbi-eath’s shoes, I h0Pe
you have a chance to get some-
thing handed to you, too.

“H_e’s a real hard,-headed,
business man. He wants the best
of everything.” The Commis-
sioner also said‘ that the Pirates
win be paying $81,000 less a
year in the new stadium-
“Litchﬁeld’s not as excited
about this move as the baseball
people are,” he Said-

The Steelers, football team
meanwhile will be paying $36,000

Field bill. Owner Art Rooney has

however. “He’s the fellow who’s

realy going to lose out if this

goes through,’-’ said Dr. lVIcCle1-
land. “But Rooney’s_ a’ nice guy
and they’ll take advantage of
him.” ‘ ' — .

   I Stadium Stance   

 

Pittsburgh's most colorful political footballs in recent years,
, as well as a forced campaign issue. Without reiterating the
if“E-i«.intricacies of the hot debate over the projected home of our
_ baseball and football teams, let i.t be said that the most true
 ‘ _ and clear voice in the entire hassle is that of Chancellor
7‘  ‘Litchﬁeld.
3‘ The landlord of .the Pittsburgh Pirates, as one news-
paper chooses to call him, entered the stadium squabble
with.a tactful but strongly worded statement. It is his con-
tention that Forbes Field must be moved out of the way as
soon as possible, in order to allow the University to expand
its building program. All considerations -will be given to
the teams, he said, but time is running short. -

Litchﬁeld then stated that to do otherwise would be to
neglect his responsibilities as Chancellor of the City’s largest
and most progressive institution of higher learning.

And it is those responsibilities which justify the Chan-
.cellor’s ﬁrm stand. - Graduate schools and research centers
are, frankly, more important than baseball and football,
regardless of what this town's citizenry thinks. If the
teams receive their stadium, then let them play ball. But
how long can they retard the progress of Pittsburgh’s edu-
\ A cational industry with the incongruity of a baseball diamond
' in the heart of the City’s study center? ' '

We agree that our ﬁrst responsibility is to see the ful-

ﬁllment of the proposed expansion plan for educational

' buildings, with an effort to avoid friction with the com-
munity. But ﬁnding a home for the teams is not our worry;
it is the concern of the City and County.

The City and the County, driven by the wishes of the
entertainment-hungry public, have succeeded in producing
the country’s most beautiful white elephant: The Civic
Arena; they have voiced their approval of a new $45’ million
stadium but cannot scrape a few thousand dollars for the
‘Pittsburgh Symphony; and they now are committed to

. paying $43,000 for entertainment at the annual County
Fair, too much of which will go to a comedian whose chief
I asset is a moronic smile. . .

The people of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County — and
their respective oﬁ”1cials—apparently rate educational pro-
gress, second to entertainment. It is commendable that the
Chancellor has voiced the opposite so strongly.

  ‘Social’ Fraternities

 

The fraternities on the University campus are
in trouble. This is no great revelation.‘ They have
been in trouble for the past several years, .and
though they are not always the ﬁrst to admit it,
the brothers know i‘ better than
anyone. Statistically, the situa
tion can. be spelled out. Where
there were 18 fraternities ﬁve
years ago, there are 16 now, and
there were almost 15 but fo
some fast and effective action;
on the part of Interfraternityi
Council and some hard work on
the part of one or two_brother
of a dying frat.- The‘ itota
brotherhood has declined from
about 625 last year to about 525
this year.
ﬁnancial diﬁiculty, and four do not have housing
facilities. V

But this is only a part of the situation, and
statistics such as these constitute only the symp-
toms and manifestations of the overall "condition.
There are basic and pervasive problems, some in-

 

 

    

herent in the system and some ‘inherent in the en- '

vironment but all combining to force the frater-
nity system. into a whirlwind from which it hasn’t
been able to emerge.‘
Strength in Distance
In general, it seems, the farther a campus is
situated from a major city the stronger the fra-
ternitysystem. This, of‘ course, is a view from the
outside, but there appears to -be a basic problem
of competition —‘-competition with the city and’
with an active and culturally oriented university.
The -basic purpose of a fraternity, and noone, I
think, will deny this,‘ is to provide a social atmos-
phere’ and to act in a supplementary capacity to a
‘ university-inspired academic. environment. A large

city such ‘as Pittsburgh, hpwever, provides-an al-‘

most inﬁnite array of social opportunities. One is
almost never at ,,a loss for something to do on a
Friday or Saturday night or on any night of the
‘week, for that matter. And a university community
as balance and vital as this provides little if any
nourishment‘ for a system not taking direct part

At least half of the fraternities are in *

By Stan Stein ’

in university activity. What results, then, is an ab-
sence of a raison d’etr_e for the fraternity, a‘ grad-
ual disappearance of the basic purpose upon which
social brotherhoods were founded.

Not only is there an environment of active com-
petition with the fundamental fraternity purpose
.within the University but‘ there is also a marked

atmosphere of passivity with respect to adminis-

tration fraternity policy. The University adminis-
tration has remained, in past years, as a silent and
not too helpful observer of fraternity activity.
True, it has done nothing to impede‘ fraternity
growth, but it has done nothing constructive to
aid the system either. University officials seem
content to sit back and wait for the fraternity
system to die out. No reason has beenstated for

this lack of action, but whena national organiza-,

tion feels that the administation of a school is re-

luctant to assist a local to develop, the national.
is wary of investing too much time, effort or‘m0ney"
on its own. The resulting situation is a downward

spiral of’ ﬁnancial trouble, deterioration of housing

facilities, breakdown of brotherhood relationships,

rushee drop-off, and, ﬁnally, collapse of the. fra-

ternity itself V 

Systemls Deficiencies _

Of course, to blame the.Unive.rsity or the en-
vironment alone would not constitute a complete
appraisal. of the situation. There are deﬁciencies
within the system itself which only the brother-'

hood can correct. ‘The fraternity system‘ ‘on this 4; '

campus has never_ been University-oriented, at
least not in the past four" or five years-. There has
been little ‘that the system has done without the
prime consideration of how it will beneﬁtthe sys-
tem. Interfraternity Council, too, plays its cards
too close to its’ collective vest. Case in point, de-
ferred rush. It seems that if regular rush,has not
done what "it was‘ meant to do, then some other
method might be tried. But IF recenty voted ‘down

deferred rush with a unanimous show of hands. , . p,‘
At present, the fraternity system is ﬁghting a 2”‘ 7".‘

suicidal. battle. There is little comfort in the fact
‘that fraternity systemsall ‘over the" country are
ﬁghting losing battles, since it is a war from which
none of them may ever emerge.

The gesture—for such it, will
be—will not be one of-deﬁance,

respect for the scientific
achievements of Dr. Teller.

The gesture, a small one in-

Boxing Wrest|er’Says

Editor, The Pitt Ne'ws:

‘I am writing this letter in
reply to -an, item contained in
Jim O’Brien’s column of March
18 entitled “Skipping About.”
The item in question concerns
my assulting Charles Samonsky
in the wrestling room of the
Pitt Field House. '

My main criticism of the
piece is that what was printed
did not come from a prime
source, namely myself. Though
he did ~_ speak to me after the
incident, I carefully explained
to Mr. O’Brien that what re-

sulted\was an outburst of tem— /'

calculated ‘malice preceded by
accusations that Charles Sam-
onsky was ‘engaged in ques-
tionable actions, as his article so
subtly indicates. A

Samonsky" did hurt my knee
in this "match, butcnot with a
move not thoroughly approved
by the AAU or the NCAA. I
did not—'turn and accuse Charles
Samonsky at any time; in a
burst of temper I merely wound
--up and punched him onthe jaw.

The so -/called “ﬂurry” of
punches indicates that I was
out to kill a man I bear no
grudge against. Two ‘punches
landed; threejwere thrown. This
indicates I should sharpen up
my right hand or quit leading
with it;- it does not indicate any
malice on my part, or any in-
tent to blame Samonsky for
questionable tactics.

The following paragraph in
the story indicates that Coach

Perry ‘said ‘.‘he had never seen’

anything like it in all his years
of coaching.” This is_ to inti-
mate that my actions in the
wrestling room are running a
close third behind such das-
tardly acts as treason and mur-
der.

Coach Michelosenl sees it on
a practice ﬁeld three times a
week; no doubt Coach Timmons
has seen it on a basketball court.

In a sport such as wrestling,
involving individual contact and
competition, ‘Coach Perry inti-
mates that since he witnessed
such a thing for the ﬁrst time
in almost thirty years of coach-
ing, there are only two possi-
bilities. Either I should be shot

Gymnast's Wife Sends

Writer Blumkin Strife

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is obvious to me and many
_others that Mr; Blumkin, your
sports writer who cgvers gym-
nas.tics,' knows little, if any-
thing, about the sport. If he
would take‘ the initiative to go
to the Field House and ﬁnd out
some details about the Panther

gymnastic team and gymnastic“

competition, your readers would
be much better informed.

Did it ever occur to Mr. Blum-
kin to ﬁnd out why we have
a loosing team? Does seven men
sound like a suﬂ‘icient_ number
for a team ‘when others have
12 to 15?

Having the smallest team- in'_

the E a s t e’r n Intercollegiate
Leagues we still ,managed to
send four men into the ﬁnals
at the EIGL Championships
at‘ Syracuse.

The only other team to com- _
of "

pare with our placement
seven"placings in the semi-ﬁ-
nals were Penn State and Syr-
acuse.

Blumkin had
asked, ‘he would have known
the ﬁrst four places are recog-

nized in the EIGL Champion-
' ships. ‘

Knowing this he might have
said that Jack Lehner was
fourth onthe long horse and
Edward Zamecnik placed fourth
in the all-around, competition.

2,100 Support
p‘News’ Petition  
Campaign

The petition’ campaign con-
ducted by The Pitt News against
the installation of additional
parking meters in the Oakland
area has been brought to a suc-
cessful conclusion, according- to
Matthew Swetonic, ~chairman of
the petition campaign.

“I‘ had hoped for a total of
2,000 student signatures on the
petition, and at last tabulation,
the» amount had reached 2,100.”

The campaign was initiated by
The Pitt News two weeks ago af-
ter .members of the paper’s edi-
torial board attended a meeting
in city hall where they obtained
a copy of the parking proposal
from a member of the city coun-
cil. -

“The proposal, if passed by
the city council, .will place
commuting and car owning stu-
dents in an impossible position,”
commented Matthew Nesvisky,
editor-in-chief of The Pitt
News, at the time of the cit
hall meeting. A.

“It was decided that something
would have to be done immedi-
ately, and thus the [petition cam-
paign was initiated,” stated Swe-
tonic. ,

“Now that all the petitions are
in our’ hands, we will forward
them to the city council with
our .proposed solutions to. the
Oakland parking I problem.”

Swetonic was silent ‘as to
wording of the alternate pro-
posal .which The Pitt News is
going to present to council, how-
ever he stated that members of
the editorial board are planning
to attend the council meeting to
present their views in person.

SG Okays Landy,

M’ k G18 ' t ents
_ Student Government ratiﬁed the appointmentnof Martin

Landy and Richard Minker for the new SG Book Center

Committee, at the last meeting of this year’s SG. According

to SG President Tom Olofson, they will be in a “policy-mak-

ing position.” Their job will be to work with the Book Cente
to make improvements.which students may desire. —

Olofson also stated that the ad—¢

ministration is concerned about
the parking situation to the ex-
tent " that Chancellor Litchﬁeld
said that if the University had
the opportunity to buy property
within four or ﬁve blocks from
the Cathedral, the University
would use it for parking space.

Olofson reported that he met
with _William G. Fisher, director
of physical plant and that he ‘was
told that there will be little room
for student organizations on floors
ﬁve to nine of Schenley Hall,
which will be converted into
ofﬁces next year. Fisher said that
Student Aﬁairs may possibly only
receive a lounge and a conference
room or two becouse of space
shortage.

Not Satisﬁed

Olofson is _not satisﬁed with this
because" organizations like the
Polaris and Skyscraper Engineer
staffs have to share an ofﬁce.
‘Even if there is a space short-
age, students should get more
space,tthan they are being given
now,” Olofson said. He plans to
discuss the matter further with
Lawrence L. Monnett, assistant
chancellor-of business affairs and
Dr. Alan Rankin, assistant chan-
cellor of student affairs. f

“This issue will be‘ stressed
quite strongly,” ‘Olofson conclud-
ed. ‘

SG voted to request that the
Library keep the Circulation
and Reserve Rooms open until
11 p.m. tonight through Thurs-
day night. The Reference Room

will also be open to 11 p.m. if
there is a need for it. Olofson
fels that “there is no reason why
the library should not be open
the extra .hour for the rest of
the trimester.”

Melvin Stein, business manager
of next year’s Polaris, reported
that the student handbook will
have approximately the same for-
mat and color will probably be
added. ’

September Announcement;
The winner of the SG Award

Competition will probably not be
announced until September, Mar-
tin Landy explained. He hopes to
have the committee meet soon so
that next year’s competition and
judging will pe over by January
and'the award can be given at
Convocation.

1500 out of 200 trimester
questionnaires have been re-
turned so far.

Bernard Adams, assistant to the
chancellor resigned from his posi-
tion as one of the three admini-
stration advisors to SG to provide
a place for a faculty member.

Physiologist Finds

Hormones Stimulating ’

By MARILYN sides -
Dr. Ernst Knobil, Mellon professor of physiology and

chairman of the department,

School of Medicine, has de-

voted his last 10 years to extensive research on the processes
of growth hormones from they pitutary gland.

Final answers have still not been uncovered, yet Dr.
Knobil states optimistically, “We are working with a level of

complexity such that any minute°

Progress, however, is

is prog-
being

Begin Vvith Premise

Dr. Knobil states, “We, began
with the premise that most tis-
sues of the body are made of
protein. If tissues grow, then the
proteins being synthesized are in-
creased.- If a hormone stimulates
growth, it must, stimulate protein
synthesis.”

How does a hormone stimu-
late protein synthesis? “We
have found that growth hor-
mone increases the entry of
amino acids, the building
blocks of proteins, into the
cells,” answers Dr. Knobil.

“Now, we must ﬁnd out/wheth-
er this increased. entry of amino
acids into the cell is sufficient to

stimulate growth, or whether this 4 A
is only one of ‘many factors in- .

,/

volved.”

Has Also Worked
Although Dr. Knobil’s major
interest has always been in the
ﬁeld of growth hormone, he has
also done much work in repro-
duction physiology. Recently, he
traveled to India at that country’s
request to take part in a sym-
posium in New Delhi-on the en-
docrinolohy of reproduction.‘
]ndia’s greatest problem right
now P‘ is overpopulation. The
government has set an official
policy ‘on family planning to
educate the people in "the use
of contraceptives. However,-
“little is actually known of
how to "control fertility. ~ the
physiology of reproduction,”

The New" -Delhi symposium,
sponsored by the National In-
stitute of Science of India, gave
the host country the opportunity,
to use Dr. Knobil’s services as a
consultant, advisor and assistant
in setting _up a program of re-
production physiology.

Judges’ Criteria
The organization of the clinic,
the preparation of material, the
knowledge ', of the subject, the
ability to express thoughts, the
originality of presentation and
material, and the appearance of
the clinic and clinician were the

criteria used for judging.

The best dental student ex-

The student .clinicians’ exhibits
covered dental problems and pro-

v cedures from such highly scientiﬁc

A Keyboard Is His Flight Deck

Jazzman on the W7i11g

By KATHIE EDWARDS
Fingers flying over the keys
of a jazz piano, or at rest,
contemplating a piece of
music he has just written,

Jerry Eckert, a senior music‘

major at the University, is
equally at home.

An active member of the U.S.
Air Force, Eckert is on duty in
Pittsburgh until he receives his
BA degree in April. He plans to
stay in the Air Force when his
enlistment period ends because he
believes that “it is a worthwhile
career from many points of view.

Military Discipline

“I feel that the "discipline of
military life is especially enhanc-
ing to a musician, since music it-
self requires such strong discip-
line,” he said.

Eckert is a native of Buffalo,
New York, where he majored in
music _in high school. Upon
graduation in 1957, he entered
the University, where he stayed
until 1960.

He was originally a science ma-
jor, with a Proctor and Gamble
scholarship. At the same time, he
was writing music. "I decided
that it was so awful I’d have to
do something about it; so I chang-
ed my major and took as many
composition courses as I could.”

Enlisted in 1961

Eckert enlisted in the Air Force
in 1961, and is now a member of
the 604th Air Force Band at Max-
well Air Force Base in Alabama.
While here in Pittsburgh,ihe plays
the piano with a dance band at
Oakdale Missile site on weekends.

“I don’t play much classical
music," he mentioned with a
grin. “I like dance work and
jazz much better. The music I
write is of the serious type,
though,” he added with another
grin. “Right now I’m working
on a suite for a band. It may
be performed at the Air Force
base when I get back, I don’t
know yet,” he observed.

While at the University from
1957-60, Eckert was Amusical di-
rector of the Pitt Players. He di-
rected the music for “Guys and

Dolls,” “Pajama Game,” and “Our ,

Town.” He also had a role in the
Pitt Players production “Time of
Your Life,” and is a member of
Alpha Psi Omega, national drama
honorary.
Honorable Mention

In 1958, Eckert wrote a com-
position for a string quartet which
received honorable mention in the
Rita Sosland Award competition
in Kansas City. He also has re-
ceived the Buffalo Chromatic "Club
Award for composition, and in
1957 was offered a grant to the
University of Buffalo to study
music composition. He decided to
come to Pittsburgh instead

“I don’t regret it,” he declar-
ed, “because here at Pitt one
can't say he's just a composi-
tion major, for you get an ex-
cellent variety of courses, es-
pecially in music history. I'm
very glad I didn’t limit my-
self to just the one phase, as I
would have done at Buffalo.

“I do look forward to a full-
time career as a composer,” he
continued, “but right now the Air
Force Band gives me a chance to
hear what I’m working on.” He
added that “I’m only mildly in-
terested in becoming an officer,
because I think the Air Force is

NYU Nuclear Program Admits
Undergraduates for First Time

The nuclear engineering program at New York Univer-
sity will admit undergraduates for the ﬁrst time beginning
with the 1963 fall semester.

“With the initiation of the undergraduate curriculum,”
announced. Dr. John Lamarsh, associate professor of nuclear
engineering at N.Y.U., “the university will be offering one of

the best rounded programs of thisé
type in the United States. The
College of Engineering has for a
number of years conducted an ex-

tensive program in nuclear en-

gineering on the graduate level.”,
According to N.Y.U., sub—‘nu-
clear reactor assemblies, a 1
Mev pulsed Van de Graff accel-

erator, a neutron howitzer, and
a whole body counter will be
available to undergraduates.

“It Goes On...‘,'

A No WHITE ELEPHANT, PLEASE

Trees Hall swimming pool has never gotten the bargain
basement rush that members of the -Athletic Department had
foreseen. Like most local sports fans ",the students just don’t
fancy mountain climbing.

Coach Ben Grady’s swimming team did use the pool,
however, and they took full advantage of the ‘ultra-modern
facilities. Princeton coach Bob Clotworthy said after suffer-
ing an unexpected. loss here that the new pool has made a
big difference in the Panthers’ performance.

Students enjoyed the 9-1 win spree and the crowds ..at
the night swim ‘meets averaged over 700 people.

Long-Range Tr/ouble _ .

A The swim team will be outstanding again next-year be-
cause 13 letterman will return. Coach “Grady-is only losing
two seniors. This, however, can prove a detriment to long-
range plans. _

Technically, that means that Grady has only two
scholarships to extend -to worthy high school stars ‘this
year. Since he only brought in a pair of boys last year,
the program could ﬂop after‘ next year.‘ . _

“Thi's’is the year we really need them,” said assistant
coach Willie Weisz. ,“Next year‘we lose about nine or ten
guys.” « " '
This is especially a shame now because Coach Grady has
been deluged with inquiries from prospective ischolasticstars.
The_WPIAL and the City League held their championships
in Trees Hall this winter and once" anyone swims in that pool; '
he is going to fall in love with it. ' "

lGradyeseldo1_n extends 'aid,to a future bust as some V
of his contemporaries do, and he should "be given more
gratuities for exercising extreme disgression on his
choices. His two select freshmen this year are Don Hahn-
feldt’, the state high school diving champion last year, and
sprinter Andy James.

panned its athletic department for failure to improve the
school’s swimming program. In fact, Columbia’s long—time
coach Dick Steadman retired just two weeks ago, ‘ p

The Columbia Daily Spectator said, “The pool of the

AMONG MY KINFOLK

My favorite cousin, Mandolinfllebe, a sweet, unspoiled country '

\

boy, has just started college. Today I got a letter l'i'0n'1 him
which I will reprint here because I know Mandolin’s problems

are so much like your own. Mandolin writes: .

Dear Mandolin (he thinks my name is l\-landolin too),

I see by the college paper that you are writing a. column for
.l\’[arlboro Cigarettes. I think l\lzirlboros are jiin—d2-i.ndy cig-y
arettes with real nice tobacco and a ginger-peachy ﬁlter, and _
I want to tell you why I don’t smoke them.

It all started the very ﬁrst day I arrived at college. I was
walking across the campus, swinging my paper valise and sing- .
ing traditional airs like Blue Tail Fly and Death a:n.d"Tra.'iLs-' '
ﬁgu.rat.i"on, when all of a sudden I ran into this here collegiate-
looking fellow with a monogram on his breast pocket. He asked
me was I a freshman. Icsaid yes. He asked me did I want to
be a BMOC and the envy of all the in crowd. I said yes. He‘
said the only way to make these keen -things happen was to join .
a fraternity. Fortunately he happened to have a pledge card
with him, so he pricked my thumb and I signed. He didn’t tell
me the name of the fraternity or where it is located, but Isup-j
pose I’ll ﬁnd out when I go active. ‘ -

Meanwhile this fellow comes around every week to collect
the "dues, which are $l00,:plus a $10 ﬁne for missing the weekly
meeting, plus a $5 assessment to buy a headstone for Spot, the
late, beloved beagle who was the fraternity mascot.

I have never regretted joining the fraternity, because it is’
my dearest wish to be a BMOC and the enyy of all the in
crowd, but you can see that it is not cheap. It wouldn’t be so
bad if I slept at the frat house, but you must agree that I can't
sleep at the house if I don’t know where the house is.

I have rented a room which is not only grotesquely expen-

" usive, but it isnot at all the kind of room I was lookingfor. I
wanted someplace reasonably priced, clean, comfortable, and
within easy walking distance of classes, the shopping district,
and San Francisco and New York. What I foundfwas a bedroom
in the home of a local costermonger which is dingy, expensive,
and uncomfortable—~a-nd I don’t even get to use the bed till .
7 a.m. when my landlord goes out to mong his cost-ers.

Well anyhow, I got settled and the next thing I did, naturally,
was to look for a girl. And I found her. Harﬁet, her name is, a
beautiful creature, standing just under seven feethigh and weigh-
ing 385 pounds. I first spied her leaning against the statue of
the Founder, dozing lightly. I talked to her for several hours
without effect. Only when I mentioned dinner did she stir. Her
milky little eyes opened, shegraised a brawny arm, seized my
nape, and carried me to a chic French restaicraxnt called La
(;'li'pjoint where she consumed, according to my calculations,
her own weight in chateaubriand.

After dinner she lapsed into a torpor from which I could not .
rouse her, no matter how I tried. I banged my glass with a
fork, I ‘pinched her great pendulous jowls, I rubbed the legs of
my corduroy pants together. But nothing worked, and ﬁnally
I slang her over my shoulder and carried her to the girls dorm,
slipping several discs in the process.

Fortunately, medical care for students is provided free at the
college inﬁrmary. All I had to pay for were a few extras, like
X-rays, anaesthesia, forceps, hemostats, sealpels, catgut, linen,

. towels, amortization, and nurses. They would not, however,

I i let me keep the nurses.

So, dear cousin, it is lack of funds, not lack of enthusiasm,
that is keeping me from Marlboro Cigarettes-—dear, good

_ Marlboros_with their ﬁne blend of choice tobaccos and their
pure white Selectrate ﬁlter and their soft pack and their ﬂip

top box.

Well, I must close now. My pencil is wore out and I can't
afford another. Keep ’em ﬂying. '
