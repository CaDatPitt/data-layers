 N(ttionul. Book Awards

by RICH EULER

The University of Pittsburgh
Press won some laurels forlitself
last month.

‘ In the National Book. Award
contest, Jon Anderson’s Death
and Friends, published by the
Press in 1970, was one of 11 final
contenders in the poetry category.

And Alehouse Sonnets by Nor-
man Dubie, another collection of
poetry, won-the Top Honor Book
citation in the 23rd Annual Chi-
cago Book Clinic. The book was
cited for its excellence of design
and quality of production.

The Anderson book marked the
second year in a row that the Uni-
versity Press has had a book con-
sidered for this award. Last year,
Harper’s Dear John,

v

in the poetry category.

Frederick Hetzel, director of
the University of , Pittsburgh
Press, says that the award is a
very prestigious one.

“It’s the literary equivalent of
the Academy Award,” he explain-
ed, “so just being nominated for
the award is an achievement.”

Whereas the National Book
Award is based solely on content,
the Chicago Book Clinic citation
is based on design and manufac-
turing. Hetzel, however, does not
think this makes the National
Award any less important for the
University Press.

“I think we can claim credit
for having the good sense to pick

V it for publication,” he asserted.

Hetzel added that the Dubie
book was excellent in his opinion.

The awards keep up a Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh Press tradition of
printing quality books. Hetzel es-
timated that, over the years, the
Press has produced about seven
books that won the America_n In-
dustrial Graphic Arts Award for

.the top books of the year. How-

ever, he could not recall every
having had two books nominated
for the National Award in succes-
sion.

The achievement is more im-
pressive since the National Award

is open to all publishers, whether
scholastic or commercial. The
University Press is concerned
only with books of a scholastic na-

' ture which do not necessarily

have a large commercial market.

Hetzel pointed out four factors
that are involved in winning these
awards. They are: quality, timeli-

.ness, the nature of the panel of

judges for a particular year, and
luck. Of these, Hetzel considered
quality the most important.

“I don’t think a bad book has
ever won the award,” he said.

Looking forward to next year’s
awards, Hetzel said that a new
book by Michael Harper, Song: I
Want ‘a Witness, was the best pos-
sibility thus far to win for the Uni-
versity Press.

“It’s'a very moving book,” he
stated, “probably a little more
domestic —— concerned with the
family — than Dear John, Dear
Coltrane. I think it should be as

__ good or better than the latter.”
The Harper book is scheduled"

forrelease sometime this fall.

For Position At Univ. of Maine

by MIKE MILLER

The Office of Student Affairs
has announced the resignation of
Dr. Konnilyn Feig, director of
Special Programs. Dr. Feig has
accepted a position as the Dean of
the College of Liberal Arts at the
University of‘ Maine, Portland-
Gorham. a

Dr. Alfred Moye, Dean of Stu-‘
dent Affairs, stated, “Dr. Feig is
one of the most creative people
I’ve ever met and has done an

excellent job in ‘terms of program- '

ming.”

However, Moye stated that he
does not intend to fill the position
immediately. ‘

“I want to look at the whole
area of programming asI prom-
ised the Chancellor.”

Moye said, “The operations
have gone..quite well and there
have been some very good pro-
grams, but the students didn’t
participate.”

He characterized Feig as “a

' great force, she gets an idea and

By Personnel Dept.

she knows how to move the thing.
It’s going to take me a while to
find a replacement; she set a real
pace.” ‘ ~ '

Moye cited ,Feig’s national rep- ‘

utation in the area of women in
higher education. She is the coor-

.dinator for three workshops in

different parts of the country and

' is on a Ford Foundation com- .

mittee on women in higher educa-
tion.

When asked about her most sat-

-isfying programs during her stay

at the University, Dr. Feig stated,
“I’ve never been satisfied with
anything. There is nothing that
we’ve done that we- couldn’t have
done better.”

The most serious problems she
has encountered in programming
has been a lack of communica-
tion. The Pitt News relies too
much on advertising, the Univer-
sity Times publishes too infre-
quently and the mail service is
cumbersome.

She stated that her work in the
area of women in higher education

.Staff'Advisory Board F ormed 

by DEBBIE POPP I

-Myron Skrabut, director of per-
sonnel, has formed an advisory
board composed of University em-
ployees to examine and possibly
revamp employee policies.

The creation of the Staff Advi-
sory Board to‘ Personnel is in re-
sponse to an inquiry made by the
Advisorv Committee on Women’s
‘Opportunity on the representation
of non-faculty and non-union em-
ployees of the University. An ad
hoc committee was appointed by
Skrabut to determine a way to
bring such representation into the
University process.

The ad hoc committee survey-
ed and divided the University into
,.22 zones employing 120-200 per-

sons in each. An election among
the employees in each zone was
held to appoint a zone representa-
tive and two alternates to the Staff
Advisory Board to Personnel.

Thursday, the 22 zone delegates

‘ held their first meeting with Skra-

but and other personnel represen-
tatives. The primary function of
the meeting was to determine the
objectives, goals, and mandates
of the board.

“The Staff Advisory Board to
Personnel is to have a dual role,”
stated Skrabut. “It will act as the
sounding body of non-academic
personnel to the staff and as the
channel of direct input from the
non-academic staff to personnel.”

“The Advisory Board, however,

The two groups of demonstra-

Stlldﬁllt-iGOV€I'Ill11€IlI; Allocates Funds

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD A
News Editor

The Student Government Board

 voted Thursday to maintain the

present $12 student activities
fee overruling the Allocations
Committee recommendation to
lower it to $10.

In a split decision, the Board al-
lowed the fee to remain at $12
onthe belief that the activities fee
might be up for a student referen-
dum in the fall.

The Board unanimously accept-
ed President Bailey's draft of a
letter to be sent to Pennsylvania

President Nixon’s latest an-
nouncement of a blockade in
Vietnam.

told the representative that they
would be supported in emergency
allocations and assured him that
the choral groups “would not be
left out in the cold.”

A meeting has been scheduled
for the choral members of Heinz
Chapel Choir, Women’s Choral
and Men’s Glee‘ Club to discuss
the public relations relationship
Monday with the Board members
and Allocations Committee mem-
bers.

In other business the Board ap-
proved several of the Allocations
Committee’s recommendations
funding the Pershing Blues,
$171.64; the Pitt News, $21,144,
and the Polaris, $1,126.

The Nursing Student Organiza-

David Wall was approved by the
Board as the new chairman of the
Committee on Student Organiza-
tions..

The proposed by-laws which
were to be discussed at the meet-
ing were not up to date and were
sent back to be revised.

     
       
     
 

 

 

Prostitutes
Feel Pinch

TOKYO (AP) — Ten thousand
prostitutes face unemployment in
Okinawa with the‘ return today
of the island base to Japan. Pros-
titution is banned under Japanese
law.

Okinawa police say many of.the
girls have debts ranging up to $8,-
000 to their brothel keepers. But
a Japanese court has ruled that
such debts are void.

Police are uncertain how soon

or how strictly Japanese law will 7

be enforced. One official said leg-'
islation alone cannot stamp out
prostitution.

Okinawa’s economy has had lit-
tle to sustain it except spending
by the U.S. government on its mil-
itary bases and by some 45,000
servicemen stationed there.

Freshman Orientation, schedul-
ed this year from June 18 to 22.
will differ somewhat from past
orientations due to a greater em-
phasis on the academic life at
Pitt.

"This year’s session will focus
on the concept of higher educa-
tion,“ said David Wahl, chairman
of Freshman Orientation. "The
new students will examine why
they’re at Pitt and are being of-
fered a liberal curriculum.”

They will also be informed of
various academic programs offer-

/ ed here including student activ-

ities, campus organizations, and
facilities and services available
to them.

New to the program this year is
the active role mentors and fac-
ulty members will play by provid-
ing two perspectives of Pitt, a
students and a teacher"s.

The expected 2,000 freshmen
will divide into groups of 15 to 20
with a mentor and_ faculty mem-
ber heading each group.

“In the mentor groups thefresh-H

man will be making their first
acquaintainces at the University.
We’re looking at the orientation
period as the beginning of some-

E mphasizcs Acadcrnics

thing that will last the Freshman
yearf’ ‘

New social activities this year
include a dance/xrffck concert. and
a picnic-dinner on the Cathedral
lawn. The Amazing Kreskin, an
ESP expert. is also scheduled to
appear.

The traditional campus tour will
be.replaced by a scavenger hunt
in which the freshmen will parti-
cipate with their groups.

The search for objects, such as
test tubes in Clapp Hall and paint

brushes in the Frick Fine Arts’

Building, will hopefully familiar-
ize students with the locations of
the buildings.

Evening movies, including all-
night films of comedians such as
Charlie Chaplin and W. C. Fields,
round out the entertainment for
the new students.

Another change in Orientation
this year is the discontinuation of
separate sessions for commuters
and resident students.

Only students living outside of a
50-mile radius of Pittsburgh will
register for the Fall Term during
the session. Students residing
within the radius will return later
in the summer for registration.

their pictures taken for ID cards.

The traditional departmental
seminars. including Education.
Law, and the Health Related Pro-
fessions, will also be included in
the program.

The freshmen will live in Hol-
land Hall and the Towers, with
Szabo providing meals in the Tow-
ers Cafeteria.

V At this point in history the American college student
{holds unprecedented power and influence over the foreign
»and domestic affairs of the United States. With this power
[comes an overwhelming accountability to the future.

 Throughout the past decade students have fought against
A-immoral foreign policies, corrupt political practices, unres-
__;ponsive bureaucracies and institutions, racism and-poverty.
 Through marches, sit-ins. and confrontations students have
;;.won the right to vote, the ear of government and university
officials, and political reforms. And it is time to use these
‘gains to move forward solutions to the problems which
.1 have grown up in our lifetime and those which we have in-
qherited.
 This is the time when the hope of a peaceful, just and
prosperous world depends upon how we use our hard won
'_V-power. I

My initial reactions to Nix-
on‘s, speech were shock (Hes
going to start World War III).
a half sigh of relief (He must
know something I don’t. The
Chinese and Russians must
have assured him they would
not challenge him). and slight
happiness (He just killed him-
self politically).

After a whole week." I‘m
still not through reacting. Af-
ter reading the text of his
speech over and over, I can’t
help but feel that whether
all‘. some. or none of theabove
are true. the President did
call on the pride of the Am-
erican people to justify _§hiS
action‘. by repeatedly refer-
ring to the continuation.of the
“great American honor.”

I feel. he put the screws to
about half of the American

1

_ take appropriate measures with-

population by disregarding
their long protest. pleadings.
and burning desire. to get out
of that miserable war. I also
found myself questioning
the sincerity of the presidents
reasoning. which led to his

decision.

The mining has not been
challenged (yet? ). Whether the

choice was good or bad re— '
mains to be seen.

Henry ‘Kissinger told him in
1969. the mining would not
be adequate because of the
other ports available and be-
cause of the overland move-
ment through China and Cam-
bodia. And instead of poli-
tical death. the President
seems to be enjoying new
strengths of support.

People who were not ready
to commit themselves to a de-
cision on the war. the unde-
cided. have apparently decid-
ed to support the decision.
Perhaps because of the pre-
sidents plea that the great
American people’s honor and
sense of helping those 17 mil-
lion South Vietnamese people.

Nixon reported that over 20.-
000 South Vietnamese civil-
ians have been killed by the
“wanton disregard for_huma_n
life" initiated by the North.

How about the bombing of
Hanoi and Haiphong? Isn’t
that “wanton disregard for hu-
man life" or aren’t the North
Vietnamesevhuman? Is Am-
erica -justified to kill because
the commies did itfirst?

The president then confessed
that he had done everytliing
possible to “consider every
avenue of peace." That should
read. ‘everyiavenue of peace.
except total withdrawel.”

But. as‘

The South Vietnamese Army
is having monumental trouble
with desertions. The leaders of
that army are shooting de-

serters on sight. Yet. America‘

has to save the South. when the
protectors of the citizens. the
soldiers. think enough of
their country to run and not
f'ight.

How about Czechoslova-
;kia. Why didn‘t we care about
those millions? Why didn't
we care about the billions of
India and Pakistan in their
war? Why didn't we consid-
er the millions of .Jews who
were begging us to help in
their war with Egypt.-What

is so important about South , ~‘

Vietnam. I don't buy Nixon's
thinking.

Who is to say that if the‘ I

communists are stopped in
Vietnam they will never’ un-
dertake future aggression? The
same thing was said about all
the wars in the last 100.years.

vAre we to be the policemen of

the world for eternity?

“The killing in this tragic
war muststop” but the mining
and the bombing and contin-
ued help to the South must
continue. Is this congruent?

While the North might have
the Russians and Chinese sup-

plying them with tanks. mig-'

aircraft, and other war mater-
ials, American is supplying the
South with war materials. B-
52 Bombers. and the Ameri-
can Navy.

‘It is my sneaking suspicion
that Nixon has not given up
the-idea of military victory.
Which, to me, means we will
be in South Vietnam in some

way. shape. or form as long as ~

people like Mr. Nixon remain
in office. ‘

  Letters to the Editor

Poor Tenure Policies

‘Dear Editor:

;I very much liked the editorial
that you (or somebody) wrote on
Tenure Policy in your May 4 is-
sue. As a department chairman
who has recently beenenbroiled
with a decision from higher up
to reject a faculty member for

tenure, in spite of the high re—-

gard of students. I feel strongly
that the present tenure proce-
dures and criteria are terribly
unfair.» " I V:A._,+

I am afraid that only a major
unified effort of students and fac-
ulty will be able to change a sys-

tem that permits good teachers to I

be terminated. It’s a sobering
thought that universities are gen-
erally far behind mostother kinds
of organizations in the matter of
job dismissals.

Do you think there is any pros-
pect for mobilizing any student
sentiment for this? If so we might

' get together and discuss it.

To enhance communication

To provide representation on

To meet these objectives, we
have proposed an activities fee
of $5 a term ($2.50 for part-
time students) which may be used
in the following manner:

Almost three-fourths of the

Apathy Hit

Dear Sir:
Upon reaching Bigelow Blvd. on

last Wednesday afternoon I was .

greeted by the blaring of multi-
watt, speakers memorializing the
four students who were so cold-
bloodedly killed at Kent‘ State last
year.

I expected to see throngs of peo- I
ple standing around the speaker’s _

podium which was set up on the
Cathedral steps participating in
the rally, but instaed all I saw
were a few interested bystanders
mulling around. It was appalling.

Once again sir the Pitt commun-
ity has demonstrated its blatent
apathy giving one more reason
why a man like Richard Nixon can

lead this country around byfits ‘

munity discussions. . ' ‘ A

The purposes of the ODI are “to recommend action on planning I I

proposals and to initiate developmental plans of its own.” The Board ‘C i '
of Directors of the ODI will represent threes areas—community (51 . ’
per cent), institutions, and affiliated interest groups. This is the first _ P . ,
time an official joint ,group has been formed concerning the planning

and development of Oakland. The new group will meet Wednesday, May S
24, to set up guidelines and to elect a chairman. ’
The ODI will continue to work on two problems that were discuss- '

ed at the Thursday meeting, implementation of the Forbes Phase Ipro-

. r O
Ject and usage of General State Authority land. ' . ..

A revised plan for Pitt’s Forbes Phase I Project was presented by  ‘ I   .
Jim Strahorn of the Department of City Planning. The existing plan of A 7

 the University places a Law School buildingin the area next to ‘David

r Criticisms of this. plan were that the building occupy too much ’
an overpass connecting for pedestrians. ‘ '- 0  
land (not allowing for future expansion), that it raises traffic circula- 
tion problems, and that it is not amenable to pedestrian traffic.

Under the revised plan, suggestions are to relocate Sennott’ St. -, ' . . A ' 3

pedestrian traffic on Forbes and Bigelow when classes change will have
to be considered in the total circulation problem. These problems will
be considered by the new Board. .

Guidelines for usage of the GSA land bordered by Oakland Ave.,
Forbes Ave., Bouquet St., and a line south of Sennott St. were drawn
up by a sub-committee of the task force which created ODI. Ideas for
its use will have to match community and University plans, according
to the subcommittee.

Consideration will be given to intergroup relations (Commuter Stu-
‘Q dent Center, Senior Citizen Lounge), human services to the commun-
ity, - and commercial areas (a laundromat, book store, department
store, etc. ). A report of the subcommittee is to be presented to the ODI
in the ndar future. ~ -

A proposal to make Forbes and Fifth Aves. one way thoroughfares
has long been suggested as a way of alleviating 0akland’s traffic con-
gestion. An announcement was made by Robert Paternoster, Planning
Director of the Department of City Planning, of a 60 day trial some-
time this summer utilizing this plan.

. If this test is successful. the trial period may be extended into the

 fall when Pitt students retu. , In the test, Forbes Ave. will be east-
bound and Fifth westbound. These streets will become oneway at their
origins in the Golden Triangle and continue out to Bellefield Ave.. where
both will return to two—way traffic.

but in a fantasy full of imaginary
little boys and girls, they inter-
ractvas both parents to be, brother

1 and sister, boy and girl in love.

She is queen and he is king of the
insanity, but the reality of their
existence is the madness that
brings doom and defeat to each.

Lawrence is clearly defined. in
Boudov’s striking performance.
His reality is bright and lonliness,
bound to the strength of his sis-
ter. Boudov is remarkable in his
translation of his finest role on
the Pitt stage.

He is professional in calling
forth skill upon skill as he inter.-
prets Wils'on’s character.

Stephanie Fitzgerald reestab-

I

lishes herself as Pitt’s most tal-
ented actress in her second per-
formance this year for the Studio.
Fitzgerald is strikingly real and
expressive. Her whole self sub-
merged, she creates a character
who walks the line between the
real and insane.

The director" Karlie Roth.
spins a story on the stage with
precise timing, movement, and
blocking. She has mounted a mag-

nificant choice with taste and’

imagination, bringing her into the
small circle of Pitt’s finest direc-
tors. A

I speak of the totality of this
production with reason. It is not
too often that I have been able to

sit comfortably and watch each
area of the artistic and technical
aspects of show fall together so

-beautifully. From Norm John-

costumes to . . . well everything _

a total artistic achievement that
I have long been waiting to see.

Sign L Theft Still Plagues Parkers

by RICH EULER

Hopefully the parking situation
on Allequippa St. in front of Trees
Hall will be cleared up by Septem-
ber.

During the winter term, autos
parked in front of the Hall were
ticketed for no apparent reason.
The problem stemmed from a
missing campus bus sign which

had been appended to a“No Park-I
ing” sign. It mysteriously disap-«

peared early this year. City po-
licemen who were not familiar
with the area began tagging cars
throughout the area, assuming the
“No Parking” sign applied for the
length of the block.

Paul Popovich, University Park-
ing Administrator, stated that no
order hadbeen given for removal
of the sign. Jim Balser, city traf-
fic planner, said that he knew of
no such order being given. ’

“Apparently, vandalism was re-
sponsible for the sign being taken
down,” Popovich commented.

Popovich has spoken with Ba1- '

ser since that time-and believes
the situation will be remedied.

Another sign will be put up in
front of Trees Hall to replace the
vandalized one, and the curb will
be painted to designate the bus
stop. Two other signs have been
put up on either side of the park-
ing lot entrance, prohibiting park-
ing for 15 feet from the corner of
the driveway. This was done to
give the lot’s patrons a 'better
view of traffic on leaving the lot.

Popovich hopes, the work will be
completed by this September.

‘.‘I think this should take care of

the problem,” he said. “It was

mainly a matter of communica-
tions between us and the city —a
misunderstanding.”

Popovich also added that park-

ing will still be prohibited on the-

other side_of Allequippa St.

“I think the signs are‘pretty
clear about that.”. he stated. I

Should the problems continue.
Popovich wishes that people
would let him know.

“If there are any complaints.
let me know about them, and our «
office will do what it can to 'cor-
rect the problem.” he promised.

W(ty of Life, iP(trt of
Youth Die with Hoss    

by BOB GEDEKOH
Hoss Cartwright is dead. Hard to believe, isn’t it?

Seems like just last night be was gobbling up Hop Sing’s pancakes".
tackling a hassle of ornery leprecauns, sheltering a homeless orphan,‘
having one of his routine love affairs certain to end in failure or chas-
ing a group off da ngerous rustlers stealing the Ponderosa’s cattle.

Hoss was an American Institution. Even if you hadn’t watched
Bonanza for years itwas downright reassuring to know that every Sun-i

day night the Cartwrights would carry on life as usual, with or without
our consent. 4 I ' -

Most" of us grew up with Hoss, he was the sort of big hrother we all

longed for. His immortality seemed evident; he lived through countless
shootings, Stabbings, Snakebites, accidents, and diseases.

So when we‘ hear that Dan Blocker. Hoss to us, is dead. it comes as

a shock to us and a grim reminder of our own mortality.

Hoss was a symbol of lost youth to our generation, an eternal boy. 

It never, seemed strange when he called Ben Pa or tragic when one of

his unfortunate lovers died. because he was, after all, still young and 

had plentry of time to find wedded bliss. ,
Hoss remained a symbol of personal freedom, pride and dauntless

enthusiasm through the Vietnam War, three assasinations, the killings’ I

at Kent State and the demise of American nationalism. No matter how

bad things seemed, Hoss (and Bonanza) were there to offer a little’-

stability to our unstable world. \ i
We can’t be expected to mourn an actor we never met. But we can

not help feel a little uneasy knowing that we won’t see our old friend '

Hoss again, except in the reruns.
His passing seems to symbolize the end

When an athletic team has an

stantial gathering. the efforts of
that performer have a_ tendency
to be taken for granted. What
the star doesis respected. but it
is more routine than surprise.

So. "WOW". Bill Rea the

jump in- the history of Pitt Track.

The bigness of a track meet, however, can’t always be determ-
ined by numbers. And though there were 350 tracksters in Saturday’s
spectacle, the calibre of the competition has to be considered. This .

Mitters Salvage Singleton A
From New York Trip

By JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

This past ‘weekend wasgreat
for‘, baseball, as long as you

weren’t a Pitt mitter.

The Panthers found themselves
on the road and in trouble most
of the time as they dropped both
games of a Friday doubleheader‘
at Buffalo 7-1 and 9-4, and split
a twin bill the next day at Syra-

'cuse, winning the first contest

4-1 and losingjthe second -by the
same score.

‘For three outof _the four games
the mitters could do nothing
right. When they were bad they
were very bad, but when they
were good they were excellent.

In the firvsticontdgst with Syrra.
cuse the Panthers were just that,
excellent. They had the pitch-

, ing, the fielding, and something
.they’ve ‘lacked a great dealof all

the season, the strong hitting. ~

The beginning of the game.
however, seemed to be just a
continuation of the poor baseball
displayed the day before at Buf-’
falo. The first batter of the af-
ternoon for Syracuse Pete Freed.
hit Pitt’s start g pitcher» Bill
Shamot for a triple to left field
and scored on the next play. a
single up the middle by John
Alley.

Shamot allowed a walk and ‘a
single to the next two Orange-
men to load th bases. But in the
next minute the inning was over _
as the mitters pulled off an out-
standing triple play.

Third baseman Paul Quvaran-i

_tillo dove for a line drive, step-

ped on third base and rocketed
a throw to second to get the third
out and end the inning. ’
“That pla_v made the difference‘-
in the ball game.“ ' explained
Pitt-‘s coach_ Bob Lewis. j'The
bases «were loaded and their numgg,

  
 
  
 

 
 

‘From that point on, the Pan-

thers were in control of the game-

which went into extra innings.

-Shamot hurled all 10 innings
giving up only one run on five
hits, striking out six and only
allowing four walks. _

“Bill (Shamot) did a great job,
he pitched a very strong-game,’,’
commented Lewis.

‘‘He’s been -

doing really well this year. Con-

trol-wise Bill has improved over

last year — he’s getting his pitch- '

es where he wants them.”
Rounding out the Panthers’ su-

perbe performance.= and possibly ’
. the most exciting‘ event of the»

contest was first baseman Ken

Macha’s game winning three run«

homer over the 434 mark in deep
center field. ‘

Macha’s blast was only the-

third one in the.5_0 year history

- of MacArthur Stadium (home of

,.the Syracuse Chiefs) to ever tra-
velover the 434 mark. The other
two sluggers to accomplish this

feat were Dan Walton and the.

Pirates’ Richie Zisk.

.“It was a great thrillfor me,
it was like_ one of the long shots
I've seen hit in Forbes Field by
men like Ralph Kiner,” Lewis
enthusiastically related.

"I never thought of it "going
completely out of the park like
-it did. I was really surprised

was a well hit ball but it was
hit high and I,didn‘t think it
carried as far asitdid.“ '

The Panthers“ excellence. how-
ever. did not sustain them through-
out the rest of the afternoon.

In the second contest it was
Syracuse’s first basemt n’ that

run round tripper' to give the Or-,
angemen a‘ 4-1 edge over Pitt.

“Buster didn’t have control out
there,” said the Pitt mentor.
“Getting ahead of the batters —
this is his main asset. -But he show-
ed control problems against Sy-
racusethat. .I’ve never seen be-
fore."

Pitt’s inability I to V score runs
came back to plague it in the
second half of the twin bill. '

“It was our anemic hitting
that hurt us.” stated
Lewis. “We don‘t seem to get a
cluster of hits. There's only one
game. our 6-5 win over Kent
State. that I can think of that
we really bunched hits together.“

And it was mainly the Pan-
thers’ lack of tmely hitting that
caused their double downfall
a -ainst Buffalo.

In the first game the mitters
stranded six runners, one a bases
loaded situation. In the second
it collected 10 hits and
left seven in base. 1

“Wejust played terrible — pit-
ching, fielding, and hitting,” said
Lewis. “It seemed that all in one
day everything wrong happen-

Record Breaking Pace

(Continued from Pace 8)

“We had a powerful 440 relay
team a few years back,” said Am-
bush. “We have been having
trouble getting back on the track.
I think we were doing 435 be-
fore this meet. Our time (42.1)
is the best we’ve done this year.
I think we are really getting
there now.”

Ambush also sprinted a 98 in
the 100 yard dash.

'Red bearded Russ Stapleton
of Cincinnati had two different
objectives in the meet.

»“1 went to Drake last week,”
said Stapleton, “I didn’t qual-
ify for the Nationals. I wanted
to qualify here, and I did. I
wanted a watch, and I got one.”

Stapleton received his time-
piece by virtue of.his three mile
victory. He also cracked the
14:00.0 qualifying time for the
NCAA three mile race with his
13:57.4._

San McCornce. also of Cincin-
atti. didn‘t win anything. but
liked the meet. “I thought the
meet. was good. The track is
beautiful and the prizes were
nice." _

Banner and his two assistants,
Don Mollenhauer and Smittie
Brown, have been in the midst of
the hub bub the past week. Get-
ting things ready for 350 track-
sters in 20 events was no easy
job. Banner seemed busiest in
the afternoon when 4 events
were simultaneous. But, for the
athletes, an _hour of respite was
found before the finals.

Ben Blue, an Indiana sprinter
was a little bluer, but not be-
cause of the meet. Blue spent his
hour studying for a drama test
which he has to take on Monday.

In one of the most qualitative
events of the afternoon, Mosser,
who passed up running the mile
in favor of the 880, seemed to
outrun the wind as he passed
Jay Fabien coming around the
final turn to win the half mile
going away.

Mosser‘s 1250.6 enabled him
to surpass his own previous meet
record. Mosser also cracked a

The South squeeked past the North, 3-2. in the coaches Trl-State A

second baseman Bob Livingston.
first baseman Ken Macha, and
catchers Guy Caparelli and Pete
Martorelli.

These.Panthers, with the ex-
ception of Martorelli, were also
named to last year’s All—Star
team along with ex-teammate Bob

' Solonickne who graduated this

past year.

Niccols went the first three inn-
ings and gave the South its first
run. The North came back in the
fourth and scored two runs off
of Tom Sochacki to take the lead.
Pitt’s Livingston was the first
run to score for the Northerners.

The South, howéver. grabbed
two runs in the sixth and on the
pitching_of West Virginia’s ace
Kim West, successfully shut out

I _ the North in the last three inn-

ings to capture the win.

West was voted the Most Val-
uable Pitcher of the game and the
Most Valuable Player Award was
given t_o another South player.
Ron Sigafois from Waynesburg.

“It was a very well played game
—it was evenly matched and very

I A few errors avere made,”comment- .

ed Pitt’s coach Bob Lewis.

“We got a good crowd of about ,

500 people to see the game.” he
continued. A lot of the people
were scouts who came to see a lot
of good players. The main ob-
ject of the game is to give the
kids a chance to play and to get
the scouts to see the better bat-
ters face the better pitchers.

For the first time in its history, the University of Pittsburgh will
fail to field a freshman football squad.

No, it‘s not because head of Pitt recruiting Serafino "Foge" Fazio
and Carl DePasqua and company failed in their search for top quality
ball players. Quite the contrary.

Thanks to a new National Collegiate Athletic Association ruling
making frosh eligible for the varsity, freshman football here has be-
come a thing of the past. '

“This year, the freshman players, will be sent to summer camp
with the varsity where we hope they’ll push the varsity boys,” explain-
ed Fazio. “We expect some to make the traveling squad immediately,

and as the season goes on, perhaps we’ll find a starter or two.”

Fazio has good reason to be optimistic about this years crop of re-
cruits, the first since he became Pitts’ full time recruiter.

, Four gridders signed from prep schools, and allhave a- good shot
at starting positions'—Keith Bevan, a 215 pound tackle; Mike For-
michella, a 220 pound defensive end, 225 pounder Ray Zu-
raw, all from Milford Academy in Connecticut, and big Ray ‘Olsen, a
245 pound lineman out of Nassau Community College.

There’s also a pair of familiar local names coming here for the
fall. The more heralded and least expected. of this duo is Bill Skorupan,
a 6’, 195 pound linebacker from Beaver. His brother, John, pushing for
All-American honors at Penn State, was heavily recruited here, and it
was assumed that Bill would go there with him. But young Skorupan
wanted a chance to go out on his own, and after narrowing his offers to
three schools, decided on the Panthers.

The other boy Blue and Gold grid fans will recognize is Bobby
Flanigan, a cousin of Jim Flanigan, a Pitt ball player now earning his
daily bread with the pros. Like Jim, the 6’3”, 195 pounder from West
Mifflin South is here as a linebacker.

The Cats also lured a Connecticut schoolboy All-American to our
Cathedral campus. Paul Mariano, a 6’3”, 245.pound offensive tackle,
will try to turn hislmuscle and impressive high school credentials
intola varsity spot once next year’s hitting begins.

Another highly touted lad to watch for next season is Joe Fasula,
an All-State defensive back for perenial district powerhouse, Mt. Leb-
anon. A strong 6’1”, 190 pounder, Joe is expected to see a lot of time in
the Panthers sometimes porous secondary.

DePasquas’ defense picked up another highly sought linebacker in
the person of Jim Smith, a 6’, 205 pound gridder from Delone Cath-
olic. '

Two other boys with a lot of potential are Theo Lawrence of Clarion
and Ed Kucharik of Lorain, Ohio. Both are 6’6” tackles, 215-220
pounders, and both could develop quickly with a little more bulk.

Though Panther recruiters tried to shore up their defense, they
signed a pair of fine quarterbacks in 6’3” Don Herald of Erie Strong
Vincent and 6’l” Denny Miscik of Mt. Pleasant, along with speedy run-
ning back Mike Mehalik from Ohio and Dennis Moorhead of Indiana.

So the Panthers have done well, recruiting wise, but as Coach
Fazio said, “You can win the recruiting battle, but still lose the war."
Only the next four years will tell.

Best Record Ever;
Season  Mark 11-2. 3

by RON SIEGEL

The Pitt tennis team suffered its second loss of the season Satur-
day afternoon at Trees Field when they were shutout by Kent State,
9-0. The netters rebounded immediately as they downed Youngstown in
the second half of the doubleheader, 7-2.

The KSU match saw Pitt ace Joe Kantor suffer his third loss of the
season, as he was upended by Robert Morris transfer Garry Levy in
three sets, 6-3, 1-6, and 6-2. Kantor came back in the Youngstown match A
to edge Joe Lucci, 6-1 and 6-3.

Captain Gary Schwartz saw his seven game winning streak endlasl
he lost both of his matches. First Owkie Kwik took Schwartz in the
three sets, 4-6, 6-1, and 6-3; then Vic Piccione won by a 6-2, 7-5 score.

George Diieflfenbach suffered his third loss of the campaign when
he was. defeated by Denny Burns of KSU, 6-3 and 6-2. He came back in
the second match to edge Hank Diorrio, 6-4 and 7-5. A

. Tom Current remained -the winningest Pitt netter although he lost
his second match of the season, 6-4 and 6-4, to George Wesner of KSU.
In the nightcap he came back to defeat Ranger Cessna, 7-6 and 7-5.

Wally Ellman bowed to Dave Elkovitch of KSU before edging
Youngstown’s Dennis Bianco, 6-3 and 6-4. Bill Wood was defeated twice, .
first Jim LaGanke, 6-2 and 6-2, and then by Jeff Catrone, 6-4 and 7-5.

Because of the doubleheader and the fact that the match was al-
ready decided, the KSU doubles were played pro-set, one set to eight to
determine the winner. The Youngstown match was undecided at the
start of the doubles, so they were played regular.

The Kantor-Schwartz team lost to Levy-Kwik, 8-4, before edging
Lucci-Piccione, 7-6, 6-0. Dieffenbach-Current had a similar fate as
Burns-Elkovitch won, 8-6, followed by Diorroio-Catrone falling, 6-2, 6-1.

The doubles team of Mike Pines and Wally Ellmanxsuffered their
first defeat of the season since being united late in the season. After
losing to Wesner-Jack J anosik, 8-6, they returned to their winning ways
by edging Bianco-Ken School, 4-6, 6-2, and 6-4. The final game featured
a deuce that Just would not end, and finally Pines hammered down the
winning shot up front.

Coach Fran Webstér’s charges are now 11-2 and will close out the
season with their winningest recor.d ever. Unless arrangements were
made to make up last week’s California match, the squad will have end-
ed their season.

These days you don't have to look
very farto find asmall,economical car.
But to find one that's economical
and a pure-bred, SCCA-winning
sports car—well, that leaves you a
choice of about one. i‘:
MG Midget. '
Just the right size for you, your
friend and enough gear to see you
through a weekend.
You'll discover that the real

meaning of “sports motoring" has

nothing to do with 1/4—mile strips at
abandoned airports.
It has to do with roads that take
to the hills where the scenery and G
fresh air are. Roads that turn and twist
and meander down the other side,
faithful to the contours of nature.
That's where terms like rack-and-

pinion steering, front disc brakes,
race-seasoned suspension and a
close—ratio 4—speed gearbox, start
rriaking sense to the uninitiated.

 

And you'll wonder how you ever drove
without full sports car instrumentation:

, an electric tachometer, separate

gauges for oil pressure, water
temperature and fuel level. There's
even a trip odometer.

MG Midget sports other standards
like a 1275 c.c. overhead valve
engine, mag-style wheels, radial—ply
tires, leather steering wheel cover,
reclining bucket seats, full carpeting
and three—blade windshield wipers.

What do you pay for this small
economical sports car? Of all the
proven winners now in national SCCA
sportscar racing, it's the one with
the lowest price tag.

A little for a lot of sports car.
