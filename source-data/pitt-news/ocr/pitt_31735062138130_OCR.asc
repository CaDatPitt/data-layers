Long j'Pr-airie
By OTILLIA _F. PPEIFEER

(copy:-i¢h‘t.' 1919. by the Weston nun-‘
 Unlon.) . ,.

“If, as you say, your daughter has
been simply triﬂing with my son, she
is a ‘heartless ﬂirt l”.declared Martin
Denby ‘sternly.

“And your son, is u scheming for-
tune hunter!” came the wrathful re-
sponse of Adam Truston. .

‘.‘Hector does not ‘have to be that.”
observed his father; “You make great
claims in your , purse-proud h’aughtl-
ness, but I fancy I could discount-your
boasted resources doubly. You have
always hated ‘me as a business grlval.
You havesome wild idea that ‘no one
is good enough for your daughter, un-
less he is a prince or 9. count at the
least. Go ahead, then. Buy one, if
that is your ambition. but just-as
fully as yourself I have no overpow-
ering ambition to. be connected with
your family in any way.”

“Your son has, but he won’t!” ob-
served Adam Truston. spicily.

“Hardly, if I can help it. I have
sent him awayito. Long Prairie, and a
month's sojourn will cure" him of thl
ridiculous love folly." _: ~ »

Adam Truston did notknow where
Long Prairie was, and ﬁrmly. made ‘up
his mind -that neither should Adelia.
He smiled whlmsically as he recalled
that ‘he had dispatched his daughter
to an aunt living at Shortville theday
before. After that he boasted to his
famlllars as to how he “had sat down
hard on those'De,nbys,_” but more than

‘once felt nettled to realize that the
elder Denby as persistently as’ him-
self opposed the possibility of the
two young people golngtogether.

“I am afraid we have used undue
harshness in dealing with Aidella,"
his wife told him about a week later.
“I have received two letters from her,
and both exhibit gloom and unhappi-
ness." ’

' “I have arranged to motor down. to
Shortville Saturday,” announced her
husband. “My friend,’ the banker
there, has ‘commissioned me to pur-
chase some securities, for his institu-
tion, and _I shall stay over Sunday with
Aunt Selina and Adelia.” '

Truston started’_out on his trip late
Saturday afternoon, driving his auto-
mobile himself. He had never been to
Shortville, except once by train, and
at dusk, as he entered a village garage
well on his route, a disturbing discov-
ery troubled him not a little. A rain-
storm had come. l1,P-A and he sought
shelter for himself and; the automobile,
until it was over.

“How far is it to Shortville?” he in-
quired of the garage man.

“Six miles. You see, this is Long
Prairie, named after the long stretch
between the two towns.”

Truston was warned that the prai-
rie road was a short cut, unpaved,
might be sort ‘of rutty on account of
the -rain, and. was advised to take
the regular turnpike. Learning, how-
ever, that the latter route was indi-
rect and much longer, be‘ determined
to face darkness and uncertainty, and
started out toaget to Shortville as
quickly as was possible. .

Two miles covered, Truston knew
that he had fallen into a nest of dif-
ﬁculties. In some way he had strayed
from the shallow dirt road and was
humping over clods and stones. .It had
begun to rain again. He passed no one
on the route, nor any house, and Long
Prairie he found well ﬁtted its name.
and was very long indeed. 9

.Truston tried to locate the wagon
trail again, and made for a glow as of
a camp, ﬁre at a little distance. He
drove up to it, to ﬁnd two rough-ap-
pearingfellows resting on the ground
in the glow of the ﬁre where a thicket
of saplings afforded some shelter.

“Can you help me ﬁnd the road and
direct me to Shortville?” he asked.

"‘Sure, we can," replied one of the
men, and both approachedthe auto-
mobile. Their shrewd, sinister glance
ran over the well-dressed motorist,
noting',the heavy watch-chain and the
opulent diamond ringihe wore. Then
onetof them spoke rapidly, in a low
tone to the other. Truston was sud-

Just as stroke one had knocked ﬂat

which will be‘ presented at "Pitts-

company ever gathered together in a
single photoplay.

ward ‘B. Tilton. In}, addition" the pic-
ture was directed by Marshall Nielan,

who was responsible for ,“Dad'dy Long .

Less” and other big productions.
“Her Kingdom of Dreams” is.a
seven-reel . picture based upon the

"novel of the same name by" Louise
Provost. It tells the story of the dif- ~

ﬁculties of one of America's great
families. "The head of thehouse is a.
Wealthy banker. The daughter mar-‘
ries -a man "who proves -untrue to her.
Both ‘sons/are in love with a. girl who
is crooked lunderneath her appearance
of honesty and who throws-thegguilt

of a forged "check upon one ‘of them.‘

There ‘is"a°r’-ascally ‘business man yvho
tries to rob -a Westernerand his son
ofwvaluable timber lands. There are

many other interesting people and a .

wealth of plot material, all brought
together in an absorbing and convinc-
ingmanner. Miss Stewart has the role

ofa young woman from the company '

who goes to New York, secures a

Place as stenographer in the‘.ba.nker’s '

oﬁice andlater becomes his secretary.
Then she becomes involved in his
family affairs, being a power in some
of its complicated and interesting mat-
ters. ’  ‘ ,
The pictureéis a. big drama in every
way. Its theme is strong, its story
covers a great‘ range of territory/and
events, its dramatic ‘incidents are
powerful. There are beautiful and im-
pressive settings in great number.
Attention does not center upon the
actions of a single character. On the
contrary, there are many important
persons in the story, and the plot is
well distributed among them. This, ‘in
itself, necessitates the able company
that has been brought together, and
likewise it provides every member a
chance to give ﬁne evidence of his
acting skill. '
’ No story morehuman has ever been
placed upon fthe screen. Its people -are

~es§‘o1utexjy‘ «natural and its eventsiare

all true to life. It shows conditions
that exist in a large city and in big
business, and proves that no family,
wealthy or poor, is invulnerable.

The, entire program at the Grand
will be of a high order. It will con-
tain a new and original farce comedy,
the Grand News_Weekly, the “Topics
of the 'Day,” and the Pathe Review.
The musical program will be -of, the
splendid type always found at the
Grand. The symphony orchestra, un-
der Director David Broudy, will play
a list of high class selections ar-
ranged to suit the pictures by Zoel
Parenteau, Both -orchestra and pipe
organ will be all-day features. Per-
formances continuous from 10a. in. to
11 p. m.

DAV-ls TH EATER

Though the whole world. may go
dry, all Pittsburghers and their neigh-
bors roundabout may quaff the in-
spiriting nectar of “A Rainbow Cock-
tail” in the forthcoming week, for
Keith vaudeville at the‘ Davis Theater
is to serve this exhilarating concoc-
tion across the footlights every after-
noon and evening. In the verbiage
of the stage, “A Rainbow Cocktail”
is a musical fantasy. It is said to be
intoxicating in its riot of rhythmic
melodious cadences, with its girls and
clever color schemes. Written for and
originally» produced at a Gambol of
the Lambs in the Lambs’ Club. of
New York, it has enjoyed a tremend-
ous vogue at its public performances
in the Palace Theater, .Gotham’s' most
exclusive Keith vaudeville emporium.
Here it has been -‘adjudged the ‘live-
liest little musical _comedy in ages.
Hassard Short has made the produc-
tion from‘ the, lyrics and ~ music by
Kennett and Roy Webb, Brieﬂy, “A
Rainbow Cocktail” personally conducts
those who journey with its unelliﬂu-
ous, murmurous music on a tour to
the operatic ﬁelds, of yester-year. A
wizard, in the person of Bruce De
Lette, carries the party into the realm
of “Floradora,-” “The Mikado,” “Piff,
Paff, Pouff” and ‘The Merry Widow.”
Here Helen Coyne, dainty, debonair
and talented‘, is aided by a group ‘of,
other pretty girls in nealizing the
musical memories of days gone by.
Colorfully staged and beautifully cos-

'1tumcd “A Rainbow Cocktail” is as

laugh-provoking situations.‘ Miss Vin-

William Downing. It is a /series of
the performers giving
plastic replicas -of heroic art studies.

7f‘ This ‘is the second National league
.‘ ' .,~ title Moran has won since breaking into

the managerial game with the Phtllles

‘four years ago, and more importance
'1 is attached to his success because of

the. fact that‘ he has piloted clubs that

ghave never before won a pennant.

 ~ Moran made his debut as manager

with the Phillles in 1915, and that year
won the ﬂag, the ﬁrst the Philadelphia

then. He does not employ the mailed-
fist-‘system. Hence his success.
“There is only one way to win,”,sald

H‘ Manager Moran, “and that is by pay-
~ ing attention to business at all times.

We play to win each game, let the
next one take care of itself. It has
always been my policy to keep my
players’ minds oi! the world’s series. I
do not allow them to worry about our

‘ percentage, ’ nd insist upon their think-

ing of nnly inning the game in which
they play. When you win games you

;..'win with the pennant.

"There must be no loaﬁng. We
.-worked hard, and we would not be
where we are today if we had not.
Every man hustled to the limit of his

35 fiability. When they all do that a iieam

_-is bound to meet _with some sort of

.. success.

"I do not want all the credit for our
success. I see by the papers they are
calling’-me miracle man and all sorts
of things.‘ The only extent to which I
entered into the victory was in the ap-
plication of my longer experience in

‘professional baseball. Every one of
‘the players gave his best effort. 1
dnerely directed those efforts, in the
light of my experience, so that they
would have the greatest possible cf-
Iect. '

“We al had something to do. Their
{part was to play ball the best they
lknew how. Mine was to dope out the
isltuations as they came up and ﬁgure
-[how to meet -them.

“So,” after all, there was nothing to
It but work, work, work by the players
and work by myself.

“One is not obliged to have a set of
rules -or ask men to be angels to win.
The first thing to do is to gain the re-

Washington Manager Puts I in
Boost for Chicago Team.

Not League Loyalty, but Oplnloll
Formed. Upon Careful Study 0!
Basebali—Tigers Had Hard
Luck at Start of Season. T

‘*1’

Manager Clark Griihth of_the Wash-
-ington American league team, in dis-
cussing baseball the other evening ex-
pressed the -belief that the White Sox
would defeat the Cincinnati Reds and
gave his reasons for his choice. It
was not league loyalty in any sense,
but an opinion based upon careful
study of baseball that the Washington
leader gave. ‘ .

“To begin with," said Griffith, “I
have not seen the Reds play this sea-
son. I know some of the older men
and know what they can do. I do
know the White Sox and I know what
they can do. I have had practical
demonstrations of what they can do.
The White So: have every essential
of a championship baseball team.
They have a whirlwind attack, it won-
derful defense, and every move they
make is directed by keen baseball
brains. . ' "

"There is no ﬂuke about the posi-
tion of the White Sox. It is true that

the Tigers had a bit of tough luck in \

the start of, the season, but. just the
same, the Chicago team is a real,
blown-in-the-glass club. They lead the
league in hit-ting, base running, scor-
ing runs, extra base hits and'every-
thing else. When they set the highest
standards in those things we can only
conclude that they are champions.

“Just take their batting order ﬁrst.

' Nemo Leibold is a lead-oif man of the
type. He is hard to pitch to and has
a good eye. ‘If the balls are bad he
won't take a cut at them. If they are
in he is as liable_ to crack it for two
or three as he is to get a single. Then
there is Eddie Collins. Collins is
about the greatest second-sacker that
the game ever produced. He is a
great hit-and-run man: or he can
stand in and slug. You know a good
hit-and-run player does not smash _the
ball when that play is on. He meets
the ball and punches it. Collins can
run the bases, too.

“Then there is no less a person than
Buck Weaver. Buck is about as good
as Collins. I think he is the greatest
third baseman in the world today.
He can go and get a ball, he can
throw, he has ﬁne hands and is smart.
Then comes Joe Jackson. Jacksonyis
hitting .350, and is liable to bust one.
clean out of the lot. Happy Felsch is
hitting about .260 now, but he is a
dangerous factor; Chick Gandil is a
hard hitter and is_playing wonderful
ball right now. Don't let any shallow
skulls tell you that Chick is not a
good player.

“It has been said,“ continued Griff,
“that if it were not for Eddie Cicotte
and Claude Williams the Sox would
be nowhere. Perhaps that is right,
but you can take it from me that if it
were not for the White Sox Cicotte
and Williams might not be anywhere.
When a pitcher can go in there and
know he has the sort of team that if
the opposition makes three runs his
mob will make four it gives him the
heart to do big things. That is the
type of men the White Sox are. They
never stop ﬁghting.

“Defensively the Sox are marvels,
and nothing less. I am going to tell
you something now that may surprise
you," said Gr-iff earnestly. “I am going
to tell you that Happy Felsch is the
greatest center ﬁelder in baseball."

“But there is Tris Speaker,” protest-
ed the writer.

“I know there is Speaker," replied
Griff. “I know all about Speaker; he
is a great ball player, but he is not
‘one whit better than Felsch, and I
think that Felsch is just a bit better
than he. Mind you, I am talking of
defensive work now. It is practically
impossible to hit a ball over. Felsch's
head. He is a ball falcon in ﬁelding
the ground hits, and he has one of
the most marvelous arms that ever
swung from a man's shoulders."

cuns OBSTBEPEROUNS PLAYER

Head of Nationaileague Be|ieves'Best
cure Is to Take His Money
Away From Him.

 

V

President Heydler of the National
league believes the way to curb a ball
player is‘%‘to take his money away from
him. Few players have been suspend-
ed but ‘many have been ﬁned for rows
with umpires. Ed Rousch of the Reds
was recently ﬁned $50 for disputing .a
called ‘strike.

 

Why was Gleason Overlooked?

Last year William (Kid) Gleason
was without a job. He had been re-
leased by Owner Comiskey of the
White Sox. Any ball club could have
signed him.

Gleason last winter was restored to
good standing in Chicago and made
manager of the White Sox.

The cry went up last season that
real major league managers could not
be found. ‘

The Geneva» College football team is
hard at Work rounding off the rough
edges of the, 1919 team before the en-
counted with, Pitt Panthers next’ Satur-
day 3-ft,€I‘_n09’n., Neverhas the College
Hill institu-tion, entered -upon a. season
With SO. much enthusiasm ,appa.‘re,nt

throughout the school.

Geneva is not a large college. It
is a co-ed .school and its entire stu-
dent body numbers less than 300 per-
sons, only about a_ thirdof which are
men. Of these men, approximately,
_50 reported for practice earlier inthe
fall. Larger colleges can ‘boast of
bigge1‘.S<luads, but  no} school ‘can.
boast of a more ,cl.eaSn-cut, hard-work-

posal. If somegof the largest Eastern
institutions would turn out ‘as many
men in comparison as" Geneva -has this
year they would have a squad number-
ing over 1,000. That is “the, sort of
spirit that Pitt is to face Saturday. I

Of course, Pitt expects. to win, but
if theydo so by {a very large margin
they are a‘ stronger team than the
most ardent. Pitt supporter can hope.
Geneva -1 is the college that defeated
W. & J.- 3 to .0 last season, and they
have- 12 of those letter 1nen.ba.'ck’on
the squad’. Of these'12;meI,1 nearly
all of them are line men who will
face the new line. that Pitt, will be
forced to use. At the head ‘of these
players is. Captain. Walter Smith at
tackle. Smith isa football player of
no mean ability. ‘ ‘He starred-ion‘ the
Geneva teams of 1916 and 1917. Last
year he was captain of the fast Muni-
cipal Pier Navy Auxiliary school team
of Chicago, ,whichj handed a, bad bump
to the fadinous-Cleveland Reserves,da
team which defeated Pitt last season
in aipost-season game.  d

At center they have Mactlrowan, a
letter, man from last year, and Grif-
fith, arecruit, who is giving the former
1a good,.i?-for the ﬁrst strin‘g*‘honors.’
At the other tackle position another’
veteran can be found to in Patterson,
who learned all the football he ever
knew at Geneva. Boulding, Mclsaacs

fore the season is -over.’ The ‘former
