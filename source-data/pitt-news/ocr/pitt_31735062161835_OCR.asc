Pennsylvcinici Slate Schools: Fciee Shutdown

BY MICHAEL CLINTON
Pennsylvania's 13 state-owned
colleges and'one state-owned
university are facing possible
shutdown.
To date. Indiana University of

Pennsylvania and. six other state-

operated schools have held either
boycotts or demonstrations against
Governor Milton SJ. Shapp. or
members of the state legislature.

According to sources at Indiana,

moves have been made to .make

Harrisburg aware of the budgetary

problems facing the state-owned

colleges, as well as a consistent
decrease ‘in both the quality of
education and the amount of
available supplies.

BY CATHY TUTTLE

“First there was the existence of
nothing. Then there was a spark.
The spark decided that if it was to
ﬂourish and to grow it would have
to feed on itself."

And so began the universe

according the Bantu legend related
by Black Week kick-off speaker
Associate Provost Donald Hender-
son. .
Following Henderson’s lecture
and question" period on “Black
Culture in the New World,” was a
performance by a student gospel
choir Some of God’s Children.

The group. directed by Paulette

‘Manning and Larry Woodson, sang

such favorites as “Fill My Cup"
"He Abides" and “This Little
Light of Mine." Some of God's
Children have given performances
on campus. in local churches and
been asked to appear on teevision.
Black Week is geared toward
black University students. but
offers cultural alternatives to the
entire University community.
“Black students don’t have access‘
to the same activities the white
students have. The
programming is geared toward the
interests of the white student,”
says Bill Kilson, chairman of Pitts’
Black Action Society [BAS]. “Take
Homecoming, for example." said
Kilson. “You had George Carlin
and Kris Kristofferson. Well,
Carlin. he's funny by anybody's
standards. but Kristofferson. I've
hardly heard of the guy. You see,
we're interested in having our own
singers. ‘our own dramatists. our
own comedians." ~
Kilson however ‘stressed that
Black Week programs are not just
for black students. “Not only ‘is
Black Week intended for the black
student body. but we hope through
Black Week. the whole University
will gain a better understanding of

everyday '

The chain reaction of boycotts

began with action taken by the

students. faculty. and administra-
tors of Indiana the week of October
21.

Facing shutdown this school yea\r.
the University's student news-
paper. the Indiana Penn called for a
rally of all University members to

_discuss solutions to the pressing’

problem of lack of state funds.
Cliff Moll, the Penn's sports
editor, explained University mem-
bers rallied against Shapp, October
26, when he landed_ at Indiana’s
Jimmy Stewart Airport for a
groundbreaking ceremony in A-
pollo, Pa.

Moll said. “Over a thousand

 

people confronted the Governor.
presenting him with a list of all of
the problems facing Indiana."
According to Moll, Shapp told the
crowd that. “He wasn't aware of
the situation at Indiana. and that
the state was going bankrupt when
he came into office. although he's
ﬁnally getting things in order."
Shapp spent an unscheduled 30

-minutes talking to the crowd. He

took‘ the list "of demands and
btidgetary problems with him.
promising to get back to them as
soon as. possible. As of yet. he has
not publicly contacted Indiana.

held a boycott against the Governor
when he visited their campus
October 29.

Barb Weiss. c_o-editor ofthe Eagle

Lock Haven has caused the tuition T

to be increased and the admission

' standards to be lowered. causing a

—higher student to faculty ratio.

"This has resulted in oversized
classes. dropped courses. fewer
sections and a lower quality of
education."

Weiss said. “The boycott was a
huge success with practically the
entire student body standing the

rain for three hours. waiting to air ’

their problems to the Governor."

Upon being faced with the
unexpected boycott. Shapp met
with student representatives and
was presented with a seven page
report describing problems at Lock

A bill lowering Pennsylvania's
drinking age to 19 will be voted on
by the Houseof Representatives
next week.

Rep. Charles Volpe (R-Scran-
ton). the bill's sponsor. said ‘‘I
totally believe that we should lower
the drinking age. We have given a
range of rights to people under 21.
Based onthis we are being illogical
if he (or she) is mature enough to
vote. to marry and to be in the

WPIC Sit-Down Strike Foils

BY LINDA SAVAGE

A sit down strike proposed for
last Friday by non-professional
workers in the Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic (WPIC) dispute
did not occur because support was
not strong enough. said a Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS)
representative. _ T

Mat Schneirov, who has been
close to the dispute, explained that
on the morning "of proposed strike
workers who felt a strike was not
necessary called in sick.

This action did. not mean they
supported the University's side in
the dispute. said Schneirov. “They
just decided they weren't ready for
a sit downstrike." '

i

The dispute started in March
1972. when non-professional em-
ployees at WPIC sought union
representation through the ll99P
Hospital Workers Union.

According to ‘Sam McGill, a

psychiatric aide, the approximately
l30iworkers in WPIC voted 64-54 in

_ favor of representation by ll99P.

The University contested the
election and appealed to the Labor
Relations Board. A hearing was

held and the case decided in favor

of the WPIC ‘workers. The
University appealed the case. but.‘
again last _Wednesday the Labor

‘ Relations Board decided in favor of

the workers.

According to John. Hartmanj a

' WPIC worker. “None of the items

_would stand up in court.'.'
Hartman said the University now
has I0 days to file an appeal with
the Allegheny Court of Appeals
and he expects they will.

Hartman denied any knowledge of
the proposed sit down strike Friday
and refused to comment on any
future plans for strikes. He said
though, that a meeting would be
held early this week and the
dispute, including future action,
would be discussed. ‘

Sam McGill, spokesman for the
nonprofessional workers, was not
available for questioning or to
verify the information obtained.

“The bill (the 19 year old) will

pass with flying colors if the people ' if *

make their view___s known to their

legislators. I'm sure the Governor

would sign it.” Volpe said.
Rep. John MeMonagle (D-Mun-

hall) said, “I was orginally for the

18 year old bill. It will be an
uphill fight to get the. current 18

year one passed but certainly the «

19 year old one would pass.

“I think it would be hypocritical
to give young people every other
right except drinking,” Mc-
Monagle added.

He agreed with Volpe that the 19 .

year old drinking bill would be
better because of the high, school
factor. L ~
“I have mixed emotions."
replied Rep. Joseph Zord (R-

the 19 year old drinking bill. He
feels a lower drinking age would
cause more highway accidents.

Helicopter
Descends On

Hillman Roof

BY BILL HADUCK

“Wait’ll some kid who’s had a
hard night after the Notre Dame
game looks out his dorm window
and sees a giant helicopter
hoveringover the library.”

George E. Simmons, project
manager of Pitt's new Chilled
Water Distribution system- was
referring to the Erickson Air Crane
which visited the campus yesterday
morning.

The huge helicopter was here to
lift two 1000 ton capacity cooling
towers, and place them on the
Hillman Library roof. There they
will become part of a system
providing chilled water to Univer-
sity ‘buildings, eliminatinga need

for individual chilling machines.\

The towers, each about the size of
a small railroad car, weigh about
seven tons apiece, and had been
lying on Pennant Place. between
Hillman and Lawrence Hall, for
several weeks.

The size and weightof the towers 4

proved no problem for the air
crane. Simmons explained, “It's
the biggest. helicopter manufac-
tured in the United States. It could
lift a 25 ton tank." ,
He added. “We broke the towers
into as'mlany sections as we could.
TlTer’s'no use making it harder
than we have to." A

 

According to Simmons, there
wasn’t a great deal of danger
involved in maneuvering a helicop-
ter -of such size among the
buildings. “He can landon a dime

_ and give you a nickel change,” he

said.

rerouted during the lifting opera-

Sources at the schools, however,

All the state-owned schools are

feeling increasing financial pres- .
sure this academic year, according -

to administrators at Lock Haven
State. They said-, “,The state
colleges are in afiscalbind because
they are approxiniately $8‘ million
short of money needed in their
current budgets."

The Governor’s office had no_

became clear the Copter’ posed no

Governor did meet with all the
state college presidents Thursday
to discuss problems facing the
colleges.

Although no deﬁnite ‘solutions '

have been reached. the student
bodies of the state colleges are
consolidating and plan to converge
on Harrisburg December 4. '
According to various sources at the
colleges, “Students are facing the
possibility~.of a stalemate in their

prevent this."~ -

hysterical defense of Jensen
claiming he has been subject to
“physical and mental abuse" and
praise for the notorious William
Shockley for calling on the National
Academy of Science to fund a
full-blown study on the “genetics
intelligence question”. First of all,
since notions of genetic inferiority
have already been conclusively
disproven both by history and by
the works previously mentioned,
there is no need to spend even a
nickel on further research.

With this in mind we could ask
why this “genetic research" has
had no trouble getting ample
funding and publicity while re-
search money in many other fields
has dried up. We feel
businessmen and government lea-
ders are finding these genetic
theories useful in their
policies of massive budget cut-
backs, speed-up and unsafe work-
ing conditions in factories, and the
deteriorating_quality of city ser-
vices like medical care and
education. Jensen and Shockley’s
own colleagues have officially
condemned them for irresponsibi-
lity. _,

As for the charge that Jensen is
being persecuted and oppressed
we can only ask why Jensen’s
supporters have ‘suddenly become
interested in persecution and
oppression? How often have they
spoken out against the oppression
minority working people face every

that these academic racists who
shed crocodile tears when people
demand that Jensen’s racist
quackery be banned fromcampus,
are silent when it comes to
denouncing racist oppression in
this country--much less doing
something about it. It is apparent
that Arthur and other Jensen
supporters are crying ,“oppres-
sion” in a dishonest and hypo-
critical way to gain sympathy and
support for their side. _

In conclusion we would like to
quote from an ‘advertisement that
appeared» in last Sunday's New
York Times signed by over 2500
faculty members from around the
country. “Racist theoreticians
have recently sought sanction and
protection in the concept of
academic freedom. This is a
subterfuge. It is true that academic
freedom protects the right to free
inquiry and to the expression of
controversial ideas. But it is not
license to justify oppression. It was
no more intended to protect racism
than verbal assault or libel, with
which racism has more in common
than it has with free intellectual
inquiry. Nor, in the light of all the
evidence, can the ideology of
racism be legitimately called
“controversial” and open to
debate. It is a false doctrine that
serves only to facilitate brutaliza-
tion and exploitation. Thus,
because it is both socially perni-

-cious and scientiﬁcally incorrect,

its proponents forfeit any right to
academic protection.”

Dear Ms. Sexton:

I note that at the very time we
were meeting with University
officials about what we consider
anti-union activities at Western

. Psychiatric, various University

people were pressuring the Chan-
cellor on behalf of Cesar Chavez
and the United Farmworkers.

I commend those who support
the Farmworkers -- but I would like
to point out that there is a danger.
It is vastlyﬁeasier to fight injustice

-3000 miles away than in your own

institution.

tion that was reluctant to support

Unionization
Sirs:
Recently, there has been a
\determined effort to unionize, at
least partially, the academic staff at
Pitt. A driving force behind this
effort has been the denial and even
abolishment of tenure by many
colleges. The rationale behind this
tenure abridgement and abolition
has been to weed out the academic
“deadwood” and provide the
maximum education for each dollar
spent. Unfortunately, these
diametrically opposed views have
tended to place the student in the
middle of the battle.

One of the fundamental ideas
behind-the unionization and tenure
is security. A teacher taking a
responsible college position ex-
pects a certain, degree of this
security.‘ By the tenure system, a
teacher, giving essentially his best
years to an institution, has a certain
amount of security against arbi-
trary dismissal. Recently a college
in New Jersey abolished tenure and
gave one year terminal contracts to
many of the faculty. What can a
man or woman who has spent 20-25
years at a college do after“ being
“Johnny Unitas” ed?

In the wake of this anti-tenure
assault, the unionization concept
has evolved. Steelworkers, auto-
mobile assembly workers and even
garbage men have security: why
not college professors? The two
opposing factions are .moving
inexorably toward confrontation.
The consequences of this confron-
tation are ominous.

Pennsylvania is “blessed” bytone
of the largest and most inefﬁcient
state legislatures in the United
States. Several times the legis-
lature has pushed the state to the
brink of_ bankruptcy by stalling
needed appropriations. The
University of Pittsburgh has spent
approx. $100,000 because it has
been forced to borrow money at
high interest rates to provide
working capital’ while the legis-
lature stalled the needed apropri-
ations. '
steadfastly’ refused to give the
state-related institutions revenue

increases to match‘ the increased J

expenditures caused by inflation.

The reaction of this legislative body '

to a sharp increase in‘ needed
appropriations caused by a labor
settlement involving higher teach-
ers’ salaries under threat of a
debilitating strike would probably
range from hostile to outraged. A
long strike, coupled with an
» extremely hostile legislative atti-
tude, could -produce shutdowns
rivaling those seen during the
UAW-USW strikes of the 1930’s.
The people caught in the middle
are not the professors. A" long
strike would call for some belt
tightening, but, with food stamps
and unemployment compensation,
most could last indefinitely.
Certainly, the legislators wouldn’t
give a damn. A summary rise in
expenditures would probably ne-
cessitate a proportional tax in-
crease, hitting their constituents
where it hurts most; ~' in the
pocketbook. A .long strike, with

- numerous pubic accusations from

both the faculty and administra-

The legislature has _

tion, would hardly endear the
universities to the hard-working
people who foot the bills for these
institutions.

By now, you've probably guessed
who gets hit hardest by this type of
confrontation; the student. Think
how a forced interrruption of 1-6
months would effect your personal
scholastic plans. Many students
are forced to plan months or years
ahead for graduate schools and
jobs. A drastic interruption caused
by a long debilitating strike could
possible scuttle many plans and
leave the student with the biggest
dilemma of his (or her) life.
Scholarships, once dropped or

‘deferred, are many times impos-
sible to pick up again. A student
who has been forced to borrow to
finance an education may be forced
to drop out of school for a number
of years to pay the loan off. As
many veterans have found out, an
education forcibly interrupted for a
period of time may never be
resumed again.

In summary, let me state that I
have no vested interest in either
view.
and (God and my advisor willing), I
won't be a student much longer.
I’m certainly not a skilled writer.
I’m not trying to sway anyone from
one point of view to another, since
this issue has polarized many
people, with any attempt to
sway them being both useless and
self defeating. I’ve presented the
facts as I see them, along with my
pessimistic view of the future of
higher education. Iwould advocate

.a tenure reform, with a logical

appeals procedure involving a
teacher's peers, for all faculty
denied tenure. If these reforms are
not ‘forthcoming in the near future,
and, if the policy of tenure
abolishment is continued, the
concept of faculty unionization will
continue to spread.

Sincerely,
Tom Goss

 Marlin Mull on a Soapbox: Ain't

fLook 'at

BY KARL BALDYS

Standing in the lobby of
Carnegie Music Hall, the audience
of the Martin Mull concert seems to
be concerned about exactly who
they've come to see. “What kind
of music does this guy play?”
“Did he have a group or
something?“ “What's all the

furniture on stage for?"
Martin Mull is not a Rock ’n Roll

A superstar. He’s areactionary. Asl

apologize for arriving late, Mull
says, “Yea, I guess they see the
long hair, give you a rough time. I
understand.” And he smiles.
That’s his act. Mull ﬁgures the
world is baked to overdone with
symbols and signs and serious
Rock ’n Roll acts. “We're all
trying to wierd each other out.

Cooper,...Alice Cooper, by the
way, would rather be bowling than
doing anything else. I think we
have to get normal.” ' .

I call Martin Mull a-n ‘anti-freak’
and he explodes.

“Look, as long as I'm getting up
on . a soapbox." ‘He seems
genuinely irritated. He is one of
the calmest actors, before a show,
I've ever seen. So, as I’m talking to
him afterwards, I'm a little
surprised.

“I'm not trying to cut anybody
down, but I don’t think that reading
any two of the Tolkein books and
dropping some acid qualifies
anybody as "a_poet. So, I’m not

David Bowie, Alice’

pretending. I work to entertain.”

“I guess if you need meaning in
everything that shows, a little bit,
where we are.” Mull takes his tie
off. “How can you call me an
anti-freak? Anybody whogets up
on stage dressed like this [lady-bug
platform shoes, wide bow tie and
satin tux] and plays guitar with a
baby bottle...”

Martin Mull spent most of his
career'playing guitar for rhythm
and blues bands in Boston. His

best routines center around the
industry. Things like a history of
delta blues as learned from a
grandfather living on the Erie delta
near Cleveland. “Some people say
vou have to be poor to sing the

   
 



blues. That's not true. My
Grandfather taught me everything
he knew about the blues. He was a
wonderful man. He was in real
estate."

Mull also spent some time in
school. He earned a BFA and a
master’s degree from the Rhode
Island School of design. He spent a
year in Rome studying painting.
“No, I don’t do much painting
anymore. .1 kind of. got away from

it. My wife’s a cracker-jack painter I

though."
Soundtracks? Films? Mull has
written the soundtracks for “Joe,”

“Jump" and “The Great American " '

Dream Machine.” He also does
commercials, “crazy commerci-

where credit is: due. »

But let’s give some credit

It takes a’good team to capitize on the mistakes of their opponents
while minimizing their own. It seems that Notre Dame gets around to

’ doingjust that every week. If they didn't take those misques and turn

" « them into scores, the Irish would have no business being ranked sixth

in the nation.

a The Notre Dame defense might have let Dorsett romp~all over the
’_ if ﬁeld, but not one yard‘! gained by Dorsett led him into the endzone.
That’s where Notre Dame gets tough. -
~ They shut down every ‘other aspect of the Pitt offense to boot. Even

, Dorsett's “surprise” pass to Rodney Clark came with excellent .

A coverage by the Notre Dame secondary. And then there was Mike
Townsend catching Dorsett in the open field to save a touchdown.
f » When Pitt came back to score a touchdown and tighten the game at
17-10. the Irish took the following kickoff and marched it in for six

points and the game wasn’t so close anymore.

Notre Dame's last

minute score made the pre-game 21 point spread stick, and when a
~ ; team is concerned with national rankings, then the scorebecomes an

important fact.

The fact still remains that the Irish were tough when they had to be
and ready to accept any break the Panthers were ready to give. The
only thing Notre Dame can be faulted for is their ability to win ball

. . games--any way they can.

That’s not taking anything away from the great showing Pitt put on.
It was a good effort; edfensively a winning effort. But Johnny Majors
hit the nail on the head as he spoke toreporters in the coaches locker

room after the game.

“Unfortunately, fate was not with us today,” Majors remarked. “I
really thought we deserved a better fate. We beat ourselves, but we 7

had _a fine effort.”

going to beat Kansas, that
Tennessee is going to beat
Georgia. The trouble is," he

added, “we are wrong half the

Forced.to move the ball quickly
with time running out, Daniels
went to the air, but the Notre Dam
defense prevailed. .l ’

After Greg Collins intercepted a
Daniels airial at the Irish 42,
Clements took ND to _the Pitt 9 in
seven plays, then hit Bullock with a
TD pass that_iced the cake.‘

“_I have a _kind of _unusual
feeling,” said Majors afterlthe
game. “I’m not depressed but I’m
not happy either. We gave the
game away." ' M . ..

but he did it here*‘in\such a short
time.” . .

After the game, Hunt was asked if
the 31-10 loss to Notre Dame put

’ the‘Cats out ofcontention.’

“No,” he said. “The score was
no indicationlof the’ type of game

5 that was played." ‘

On the field, the Panthers did
everything but beat the mightly
Irish. They out first-downed the
Parseghianites 19-15, they out-
rushed them 266 to 259, and
outpassed them 117 yards to 28. '
They moved almost at -will ‘against
the " nation’s number one defense.

Majors himself still thinks _ his
team has a chance. He -made the
strongest statement to date con-
cerning his team. .

“If we don’t make it to a Bowl,"
Majors said, “seven or eight less
exciting teams will.”

Invitations will -begin being
handed out next Saturday and if the
Majorites are to maintain any hope
of landing one, they will have to
come up with a resounding victory
against winless Army. Any

Running-back Leverge Walker

Pitt's first score, featuring a
medley of moves that provided
the glitter in a cold and windy mud
bath.

Walker involved himself with
Pitt's next tally when he found
flanker-back Milton Douglas from
27 yards out on a halfback pass.

Panther coach Bob Leahy was

pleased with the performance of his’

offense that had a pair of “almost”
six pointers in- the. bag and had
another nullified by a holding
penalty. ' -

“Dave Migliore played an excep-
tional game,' remarked Leahy.
‘Walker ran well for" 107 yards, this
indicates that ‘fullback Bob Hutton
did a job too."
