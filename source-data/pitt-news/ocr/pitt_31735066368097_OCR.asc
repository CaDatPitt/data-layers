SGB Candidates Agree on Issues

Presidential Race Centers on Experience

By LAURIE MctcLEOD

This year's race for Student
Government Board president
revolves less around specific
issues—the two candidates agree
on just about everything—and
instead focuses on the candidates’
experience.

Spencer Davis, a current board
member, is running against Mark
Downs, a junior economics and
business major. Davis, who is also
the board’s business manager, said
he believes his experience makes
him a better choice for the
presidency. Downs however, said
that leadership qualities aren’t
learned by serving on the board.

“I feel experience is not an
issue," Downs said. “I've had
in other
student groups. Leadership is a
style, it’s not something that has to
be developed.”

Downs is a member of Phi Eta
Sigma, a freshman honorary
society. He is treasurer of Delta

Tau Delta fraternity, serves as a

math tutor at Frick Middle School
and was appointed by the SGB to
the advisory board for the Office of
Teaching Evaluations.

Davis, also a Phi Eta Sigma
member, belongs to Phi Gamma

Pitt English professor Liane
Norman said that she believes her
chances of being elected to the U.S.
Senate aren’t diminished because
she is a Consumer Party candidate,
and added that other third party
candidate campaigns have been
successful.

Norman considers herself to be a
natural for the Consumer Party. “It
espouses my principles and visa
versa," she said.

The [Consumer Party, a
Pennsylvania political organiza-
tion, is 16 years old and has over
5,000 registered voters in the state.

It is affiliated with the two year
old Citizen's Party, which endorsed
prominent ecologist and scientist
Barry Commoner for president.
Citizen's Party candidates can be
found on the ballots of 30 states;
most are elected on the level of local
government.

A democrat for all of her life,
Norman has grown dissatisfied
with voting for the lesser of two
evils. “When you vote for the lesser
evil, you get it." She joined the
‘Consumer Party, drawn by the

'opportunity to participate in
actual party building.

()n a recent Roy Fox radio
program, the host claimed that
thrid parties have no chance and
shouldn't be in elections. After

having had Norman on the show,
Fox said that he was wrong and
that she was the only serious
candidate running.

Delta fraternity. He is a past
chairman of the Interfraternity
Council and served as its Greek
Week chairman.

One of Davis’ projects as a board
member was mandatory teaching
evaluations. Although the board
did not attain its goal of making
teaching evaluations mandatory,
Davis said an increase in the
number of teachers agreeing to the
evaluations indicates the project’s
impact. Last year, 808 of 1028
courses were evaluated.

boring clich’e mongers,” he said.

Opposing her in the state-wide
election are incumbent republican
senator John Heinz, Allegheny
County Commissioner democrat
Cyril Wecht, Socialist Workers
Party candidate Kip Dawson and
Libertarian Barbra Karkutt.

The major issue of Norman’s

campaign and “the central issue of
our time,” she said, is the arms
race.

“It’s been ignored for the last 37
years. When it hasn’t been ignored,
we've been treated to a pack of
lies,” Norman said. “Nuclear
weapons are used to kill and
slaughter, not to defend."

Heinz has and will continue to
support spending programs for
nuclear weapons, with the Heinz-
endorsed federal budget now
allocating $1.9 trillion over the
next six years for defense spending,
Norman said.

“That equals $36 million at.
hour for the next six years,” she
said. “The government’s
eliminating spending programs.
but it’s not eliminating the mair
one.”

The economic consequences of
this, Norman said, are increased
inflation, a continued decline in
productivity and an even more
depressed economy.

“With these programs will come
more social blight. More and more
of America is looking like
Southern Harlem," Norman said.

Norman points out that Wecht
says we have enough weapons but
we need a stronger defense.

(tit? I _ Jr.

“This is a positive effect and the
evaluations are in the range of
being made mandatory," Davis
said.

If elected, Davis said one of his
goals would be to revise the
evaluation survey, which some
teachers rejected because they
believed the questions were unfair,
according to Davis.

He would also like to increase
lobbying against the financial aid
cuts, push for more student input
on the alcohol task force recently
formed by Vice-Chancellor for
Student Affairs Conney Kimbo to
investigate alcohol use on campus
and suggest policy changes, and
increase the influence of the board.

“There is a communications
problem because the SGB receives
information (from the administra-
tion) too late,” Davis said. He
wants the student government
appointees to various academic
and faculty committees to have
more input.

Downs said he sees a
communication problem between
the board and its governance
groups and committees. He said
that the governance groups, such

as the Nursing Student
Organization, the Black Action
Society and the Engineering

Student Cabinet, should exchange
newsletters. This wouldenable the

Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Allen Ertel continued
his party’s plan of campaigning
by association Friday at ‘a rally
in David Lawrence Auditorium
with repeated references to the
“Thornburgh—Reagan as-
sault,” and the “Thornburgh—
Reagan attack."

“We need to reverse the
Thornburgh-Reagan attack on
higher education,” said Ertel in
a short address that focused on
student concerns, particularly
financial aid. “We are seeing
that the Reagan-Thornburgh
administrations have been a
double-punch, one-two
combination and students, as a
result, are having a much more
difficult time getting their

Down.s_would make some changes
in the way the board allocates

Ertel Brings His ‘Campaign

Ertel gave no specifics, saying
only that “education should
have a priority and I intend to
give it one. I am committed to
seeing that tuitions are not
increased and that- we drop
down on the scale as far as
possible.”

Ertel arrived nearly an_hour
late for the rally, which was
apparently a last minute
attempt to reach the university’s
voters before tomorrow’s
general election.

State House Minority Leader
K. Leroy Irvis, D-Pittsburgh,
and co-chairman of Ertel’s
campaign tried to “hold” the
audience ‘of about 60, most of
whom were from Pitt Professor

programming. Some groups, such

as the Resident Student
Association, accomplish their
goals mainly through such

programming, Downs said.

Both candidates agreed that the
SGB liaison system, in which
board members act as go-betweens
for the board and its governance
groups and committees, should be
improved.

According to Davis, the liaison
should be made mandatory.

“Liaisons haven't been
communicatinginformation, such
as policy changes, from the board
to the committees,” Davis said. “If
we (the board) lose communication
with the student committees, we'll
lose contact with the students.”

Downs said he believes “there
hasn’t been much personal
communication” between the
liaisons and their committees. As
president, he said he would stress
the importance of communicating
with the groups.

In working withéthe administra-
-tion, Downs said he would enlist
the aid of other student groups.

“It’s silly for the SGB to attempt
to do the job all on its own,”
Downs said. “We should use the

help of other students in
responsible positions in the
university. ”

a variety of issues, including the
economy, abortion and nuclear
power.

Ertel outlined a plan for
economic recovery that would
include the formation of a
Pennsylvania Capital Corpora-
tion that would borrow money
from public and private
pension funds and redirect it to
businesses across the state,
described by Ertel as “starved
for capital."

Ertel also called for a
taxbreak for small businesses,
giving them a choice between a
corporate net income tax and a
personal income tax, a plan
similar to that of federal tax
laws.

Ertel became involved in a
debate over abortion with a
student who insisted that any
judgement on the issue
involved modern science.

“You’re talking about a
philosophical position or a
religious or moral one,” said
Ertel. “I am personally opposed

Twenty-ThreeBoard Candidates Trying For Eight

The Pitt News, Monday November 1, 1982

 

Brian Abzanka

Freshman Brian Abzanka
said SGB’s main purpose is to
represent the student body, and
to try and influence admin-
istrators

He said SGB is the only way
the administrators see the stu-
dent’s views. S

Abzanka, who works for
WPGH radio, says there should
be more two—way communica-
tion between the administrators
and students.

“SGB should be acting as a
mediator,” Abzanka said.

He said liaisons bridge the
gap between the student and
SGB, and they should be mak-
ing students fully aware of what
SGB does.

“There should be no secrets
of what SGB is doing. Their
projects and policies should be
publicized more to make the
students aware, and students
should be made part of SGB.”

Arpi Asdourian

Arpi Asdourian said if she is
elected to the Student
Government Board, she would
practice a “revolving door
procedure” to her office.

Asdourian said she wants all
students to know, whether or
not they are a part of a large
interest group, that her office
will be open any time.

A junior majoring in
communications and journal-
ism, she said many students feel
inhibited about walking into
the offices of the SGB.

She said she feels that the
SGB does have some power in
the university because it can
override budget decisions made
by individual student groups
and because it is the closest link
between students and the
administration.

One of the things that bothers
her about the current and past
boards, she said, is the lack of
enthusiam that is present
during the board’s second term
in office.

“The interest is up in
January, but by fall it dies
down,” she said. “Most board
members are just waiting in
limbo for the new turnover. I
think the interest should be year
round.”

Asdourian said she sees '
money questions as the big
issue on college campuses today

Kathy Brown

Sophomore Kathy Brown
said a computer roommate sys-
tem would solve the problem of
students getting stuck with
rommates they don’t want. This
is one of the issues she’d like to
work with if elected to SGB.

Brown, a philosophy major,
is a mentor and a member of
Delta Delta Delta sorority. She
is also a former member of the
Resident Student Association.

To bridge the gap between
the administrators and SGB,
Brown believes faculty-student
forums should be established.
This would help each gain an
understanding of their outlooks
on education.

Liaisons ,haven’t been effec-
tive in the past, according to
Brown, “but instead of elimi-
nating liaisons, have the board
member also be a representative
to another group to double the
committee’s representation.” ,

She said SGB should work
more closely with the adminis-
tration, but avoids it because
the administration “usually
represents hassles.”

Brown added thatithe board

should "be more politically
active; - it doesn’t generate
enthusiasm about issues and
causes.
She also said SGB members
should be more involved in lob-
bying efforts to combat tuition
hikes.

 

Jeff Delmontagne

‘Delmontagne, a junior and a
current board member, said the
present allocation policies should
be more flexible.

He said each group should be
looked at on an individual basis for
quality of program. “It would be
more fair for each group if money
were allocated this way,”
Delmontagne said.

Delmontagne, a history major, is
on the Interfraternity Council
social committee. He is also a
member of Delta Phi and the
Alpha Phi
Omega.

He said the new fraternity
housing project will “greatly
diminish the influence that the
Greeks have on‘ campus.” The
fraternities will be subject to
university policy and will take the
individuality from the fraternities,
Delmontagne said.

Delmontagne said he is opposed
to the new security system because

it is a burden on the students. He

Kevin Fischer

Fischer wants the SGB to give
commuters more incentive to
participate in activities.

He said transportation for
commuters has always been a
major problem. V“The university
should try to get commuters bus
passes at a special rate and have
more free parking days,” Fischer
said.

Fischer added that “there should
be more communications with the
groups and SGB.”

He said some groups benefit
more from SGB and the allocation
process than others and a worthy
activity like Hand in Hand should
be funded more because it needs
more than other projects.

Fischer does public relations
work for the 18th Ward Democrats
in Pittsburgh and South Hills area.

 

Brett Fisher

Fisher wants to suggest a cut
in the administration’s budget
to try to hold down the continu-
ous tuition hikes.

She said SGB has the power
to influence administrators if
the student body will back them
on issues like this. _ _

Fisher, a sophomore political
science major, is a member of
the Pitt Outdoors Club. She
also attends the Arms Race
Study Group.

She said SGB should try to
educate the student population
to make them aware of the
issues and policies of the uni-

versity. “The mal0Ti1Y 0l_Pe0'

"ple on campus are apathetic,
but the people that are involved
make up for the lack because
they are strongly interested,”
Fisher said.

She added she is strongly
interested in environmental
issues on campus.

Since Pitt is basically a com-
muter school, a place should be
found for commuters to gather
while renovations are going on,
Jan Frank said.

Commuters should be helped
with their parking and become
more involved in activities on
campus, Frank said.

“Students should have more
input with the committee that
forms the dorm policies,”
Frank said. F’

She said the SGB has the
power to influence administra-
tors, and it must be more per-
suasive. With strong backing
from students, the administra-
tion can be influenced, Frank
said.

The relationship between the
board and its committees is
important because it communi-
cates the special needs of each
different group, Frank said.

Frank, a junior child devel-
opment major, is a mentor,
involved with the Pitt Program
Council and Hand in Hand and
is a member of Delta Delta Delta
sorority.

 

Mindy Goldberg

Goldberg, a junior, said there
should be more two—way com-
munication between SGB and
the committees. She said com-
mittees should also elect repre-
sentatives to attend the SGB
meetings along with the boar
liaisons. ‘

“Board meetings should be
rotated to different buildings to
make SGB accessible to differ-
ent people,” she said, “this
might get more students
involved and more aware.”

Goldberg, a political science
and rhetoric major, is involved
with the Pre-Law Society, Judi-
cial Board, varsity debate and
RSA. ’

She said the allocation pro-
cess should be changed to con-
sider each committee's purpose
separately and the level of
involvement the committee’s
proposed activity could gener-
ate instead of judging each
event solely as social, she said.

Goldberg also said that cam-
pus activities should be
planned to make residents and
commuters more cohesive. She
said commuters must have the
incentive to participate, and
activities must be accessible.

 

The biggest accomplishment
at Pitt, according to SGB
candidate Barry Greene, would
be to have every student
involved in an extra-curricular
activity.

Greene said that while classes
are important, activities outside
the classroom are equally
important. .

A sophomore majoring in

chemistry as a pre-med, Greene »£')"’

is a member of Theta Chi
fraternity, was a floor
representative for the Resident
Student Association and was
pledge dinner chairman for the
Interfraternity Council.

Greene said that if he’s
elected, he wants as many
groups as possible to get the
necessary funds.

He also said that there should
be a “pyramid system” between
the board and the student
groups. He said each board
member should sit in on the
groups meetings to which they
are liaisons, that way students
will know what’s going one.

Connie Kreischer

To increase interaction between
the Student Government Board
and committees, Kreischer said a
student assembly could be formed
in which two representatives from
each organization would meet with
the board on a monthly basis.

“Right now, there is no real
network. This would allow groups
to help each other out.” Kreischer
said.

Kreischer, a junior political
science and urban administration

. . . ¢r’"‘
major, is chairman (Of 

Governmental Relations Commit-‘

tee. She is also on the senate
committees for community
relations and common wealth and
admissions and student aid.

She said funding policies often
change and need to be more stable.
“Priorities need to be set, then
allow groups to respond to the
changes,” Kreischer said. She also
believes the board should change
its attitudes.

“SGB goes into issues with a self-
defeating attitude. It thinks it can’t
change things because of the
university’s bureaucracy."

Dan Lecce

Student government commit-
tees should be made more aware
of the allocations process, and
the board should know exactly
what each committee does
before allocating money, said
junior Dan Lecce.

Lecce said SGB should be
more active within other organ-
izations and use liaisons to get
the groups more involved in
SGB policy.

“Advertising the committee's
purposes and activities more
would help make students more
aware and get them involved."
he said.

rm’ Lecce also said he wants RSA
' and Commuter Affairs Coin-
mittee to work together to get
commuters involved. “Coin-
muters have always taken a
back seat to the resident stu-
dents," he said.

Jeff Mallinger

Mallinger, a junior, said the
Student Government Board
should have equal say with the
administrators on important
issues, such as the tuition hikes.

He said a committee should
be formed and put in SGB

 bylaws to research and try to

stop tuition hikes. “The
committee would see if there is
adequate reason for tuition
hikes, such as the cost of the
Schenley renovation,” he said.

Mallinger is a mentor,
WPGH disc jockey and a
member of Pi Lambda Phi
fraternity.

He said dorm students should
have greater say in dorm
policies. “Students might get
involved with SGB if they
thought they could form or
fight dorm policies," Mallinger
said.

He also said the Student

.Health Service should be open
on weekends since the students
pay the mandatory health
service fee.

“SGB doesn’t influence
much now,” Mallinger said,
“but if voice is raised now it
might have a significant effect
five years from now. SGB deals
with the future."

 

Lorenzo McQueen

McQueen, a freshman, said
what the board does now will
affect Pitt students several years
in the future.

“That's one of the reasons
that I want to run as a fresh-
man," McQueen said.

McQueen, an industrial engi-
neering major, is a member of
the Commuter Affairs Commit-
tee and on the task force in pro-
gress of changing that
committee’s status from stand-
ing committee to governance
group.

He said he believes the
administration feels obligated
to listen to SGB, “but they don’t
really hear what they're saying
and this communication gap
needs to be filled in.”

Board members who are liai-
sons to SGB committees tend to
lose interest in their tasks, he
said. There should be a stricter
clause in the SGB bylaws mak-
ing it mandatory for members
to attend appointed commit-
tees, McQueen said.

Craig Murphy said SGB should
look at each committee when
determining the budget instead
of a “blanket priority list” for
all committees. '

He said each group has a
different role on campus, citing
RSA as an example of a
committee that has both a social
function and an important
function for resident students._

Murphy is a member of Delta

RSA floor representative.

He said each liaisons should
set up guidelines with his
committee because each
committee has different needs
and may not need a representa-
tive at every meeting.

The mandatory teacher

and committees should be
formed to work with the

   Spots On The Student Government Board

By LAU RI E MacLEOD

Chuck Pascal

The Student Government
Board has a credibility problem
with students and the adininis—
tration, Chuck Pascal said.

SGB committees aren't con-
sulted about funding policies,
so they don't trust SGB, Pascal
said.

Because students don't trust
SGB, the administration sees no
reason to listen to the board,
Pascal believes.

SGB is mainly concerned
with the allocations process and
doesn’t follow through on
important local issues such as
public transit, dorm policies
and. commuter problems,
Pascal said.

He said that in the past, the

She said commuters need a I

muters also need more activities
and encouragement to get

Pekich said.

Liaisons between the SGB
and committees should be made
mandatory because of the lack
of communication in the past,
Pekich said.

Loretta Petretti

The new fraternity housing
project could be detrimental
because it will take the individ-
uality out of fraternities,
according to junior Loretta
Petretti.

Students should have more
input into the complex because
these fraternities will fall under
the university policy, Petretti
said.

Petretti is a junior physical
therapy major involved in
Hand in Hand, the Senate

Committee on Athletics and‘

RSA. She is also a mentor.

Petretti said she wants to see
more encouragement for com-
muters to stay on campuslby
having the Commuter Affairs
Committee work closely with
RSA. She said more free park-
ing days would allow commu-
ters to be more involved.

Also concerning commuters,
she said facilities have to be
found to accommodate them
while the Student Union is
being renovated.

 

Cathy Ripepi

Board members should keep
in close contact with the execu-
tive members of standing com-
mittees and governance groups
to understand the issues and
needs of the organizations,
Ripepi said. . ‘

Ripepi, a sophomore, is a
mentor, a member of the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences Com-
mittee and member of Chi
Omega sorority. She said the
board isn’t using all of its
powers.

“SGB uses direct powers
given to them, like allocating

The Pitt News, Monday November 1, 1983

funds,” she said, “but in the
past, influential power hasn’t
been used." As an example, she
cites the health fee increase last
year, in which no concrete
action was taken. Only research
and surveys were initiated.

She‘ said concrete facts and
records should have been
gathered and presented to
administrators.

“Administrators won’t with-
draw this decision, but if SGB
doesn’t use influence, the fee
will definitely go up again,”
she said.

Ripepi also said SGB needs
better public relations with the
students to make them aware of
issues with which the board is
dealing.

 

Jeff Schaffer

Junior Jeff Schaffer said his
main concern is to change the
-“social vs. educational” fund-
ing policy of the Allocations
Committee. “If a groups goals
are socially oriented, their needs
should be met,” Scnaffer said.

Schaffer is the appointed
president of the PPC’s Board of
Governors, a coordinator for
the jazz seminar and a former
member of RSA. He was also an
SGB candidate last year.

Liaisons must be informed-
they never seem to relate mes-
sages back to the board because
they are unaware of the needs of
individual committees, he said.

He also said he wants to get
students more involved with
dorm policy and find the com-
muters a place to gather while
Schenley Hall is being reno-
vated.

Sopko, a junior, said he
wants to see SGB issue a state-
ment explaining the position
the board takes on important

issues. _ _ _
He said the board liaisons to

the standing committees are
ineffective because members
don’t have time to “get to the
heart of their problems and
needs."

Sopko said liaison roles
should be assumed, but a
member of the committee
should also be represented at
the SGB meetings. This would
create two-way communica-
tion.

“SGB has significant power
of influence,” Sopko said, “and
an example is the student aid

. rally it formed last year.” He

said the board has more per-
ceived power than average stu-
dents because it is elected.
Sopko is a member of the
Governmental Relations Com-
mittee, and University Senate
Committee on Athletics and
president of the Judo Club.

He said it should be manda-
tory that the liaisons attend the
assigned committee meetings so
SGB knows the needs and prob-
lems of each committee.

Concerning the alcohol a-
wareness task force, Stram said
students should definitely have
more input because it concerns
alcoholism on campus.

 

 

 

Dave Sopko

Tom Wanko

The Student Government
Board can better represent the
needs of the students by being
more vocal and demonstrating
opposition on issues, such as
future financial aid cuts, said
Tom Wanko.

Wanko, a junior, is president
of both the Progressive Student
Network and the International
Affa_irs Forum. He is also a
member of the Arms Race Study
Group.

“We must vocally oppose
cutting the geography depart-
ment and other departmental
cuts, or it will set a precedent for
the future,” he said. He said
SGB is the channel from’stu-
dents to administrators, so it’s
important for SGB to meet with
administrators and argue such
cuts.

Wanko said most students
don’t know what SGB repres-
ents. “They’re not apathetic,
just ill-informed.”

Through speaking engage-
ments and educational forums,
Wanko plans to make students
more aware and get them
involved. '

“Throughout the ’80s, stu-
dents will encounter more diffi-
culties, so they have to voice
their opinions now,” he said.

Wanko also plans to start a
student committee to try to stop

'research and development of

new weapons at Pitt.

Mark Steele

Student Government Board
liaisons with committees
should be mandatory, accord-
ing to Mark Steele.

“This is essential for an
organization to be allocated an
appropriate budget,” he said.

Steele, a junior, said liaisons
are the communication system
for the board. Without them,
organizations ‘are left without
enough information to budget
programs. ~

Steele is a member of the
Engineering Student Cabinet,
the Engineering Undergradu-
ate Administration Committee
and chairman of the Academic
Engineering Affairs Com-
mittee.

He said more employers
should be brought to Pitt to talk
about job opportunities. He
would like to evaluate Pitt’s
Placement Office.

The Pitt News, Monday November 1, l982.i$.

Hear You  

Some professors and academicians are
rediscovering their responsibility to do more
than teach in the classrooms and write brilliant
papers—some, but not many, and ever fewer at
I’itt.

By virtue of their research experience and
knowledge, professors are in a very good
position to lend credibility to any exchange of
ideas outside of the traditional classroom.
Many, however, ignore this opportunity.
Without knowing better, one could
triumphantly say that most academicians just
as politically and socially unaware and inactive
as student supposedly are. Professors,
remember, used to expound their opinions on
relevant issues to their students and the general
community.

Fortunately, for a far-sighted few, this is the
case. I

Recently, some 900 faculty members and
researchers at the California Institute of
Technology signed a statement supporting the
nuclear weapons freeze initiative appearing on
the California ballot.

But what about Pitt?

Sure, the physics department was actively
involvediin organizing a conference on the
effects of a nuclear war last October. The
English department has also consistently
discussed issues in its Arms Race Study Group,
but this hardly scratches the surface of Pitt’s
potential.

In the last couple of years, there has only been
one issue on which a faculty statement was
issued. Last year, 25 Pitt professors took out an
ad in The Pitt News denouncing U.S.
involvement in El Salvador. This was the only
time that professors let the student body know
their position as a group on an issue of high
importance and relevance.

Other than Dr. Richard Cottam of the
political science department and Dr. Liane
Norman of the English department, how many
other professors have taken the time to share
their viewpoints?

If this lack of discourse is due to a fear of
being labelled or linked to the McCarthyist
inquisitions of academicians, then this itself
should be examined.

On the other hand, if members of the
academic community are too snug and secure in
their positions to care about——much less rail
against——issues of grave importance, then they
do their professions a great injustice.

Let The People Speak

Dear Editor:

As a student at the University
of Pittsburgh, I am interested in
seeing elements of our com-
munity excel. This makes me
feel proud of the University of
Pittsburgh. One element I am
especially interested in is The

- Pitt News. A school newspaper

is in many ways a reflection of
the school itself.

A couple weeks ago, I sub-
mitted two letters to the editor
on ‘divergent topics. Each letter
had a sign-off postscript that
was not my name. The reason
for this was that these posts-
cripts would and did add to my
letter. I, of course, submitted my
name, etc. as is policy. I was
assured my letters would be
printed as I submitted them.
Everything I wrote was impor-
tant to the opinions expressed
in each letter. Upon opening
The Pitt News on Oct. ll, 1982,
I immediately saw, instead of
my sign offs, the familiar
“name withheld by request.”
This angered mejust a little till
I read further. The worse was
yet to come.

The Pitt News reserves the
right to edit all letters. I ques-
tion this right (whatever hap-
pened to free speech, the First
Amendment? The press is
founded on this right). If The
Pitt News’ editors are going to
edit a letter, I feel it is their
solemn duty and responsibility
to inform, before they edit and
print, the author of the letter as
to what they are going to edit. If
not, they The Pitt News, will
change the author's original
intent and message. This is not
The Pitt News’ responsibility,
to knowingly. through policy,

shape the opinion of the author
to something other than
intended by deleting a certain
passage. Arid only the author
can know what the original
intent is, so it is up to this per-
son to edit his material.

If the editor cannot get hold
of the author of the letter (con-
cerning editing), do not print
the letter! Wait until the author
can be contacted. This hap-
pened to a letter of mine. An

‘Change this policy
that threatens free
speech and smacks of
unconstitutionality.’

important, vital section was
deleted, at The Pitt News’ edi-
tors discretion, that drastically
changed my message. So, to the
public, my message and opin-
ion was altered from its original
intent. This is a direct attack on
free speech and the First
Amendment. The Pitt News is
taking too greatly their right to
edit grammar and abusive lan-
guage. I hate to get on a soap
box, but free speech is what
separates the US from [hg
crowd. And since the university
is a, learning experience, what
are you learning?

So, when The Pitt News edits
without first (‘ontacting the let-
ter's author, they lose credibil-
ity. And for a paper to lose

Letter Policy 

credibility is journalistic death.

So wake up, your paper is los-

ing credibility. Then further,

since our newspaper reflects on

our school, this loss of credibil-

ity reflects on Pitt. It is the

responsibility of The Pitt News
to report the news, and on the
opinion page to express the
paper's opinion through its
staff writers. It is not their
responsibility to edit others’
opinions. Let people say what
they want to say!

‘So please tighten up your
organization and think what a
paper is responsibile for. Every-
thing you print reflects on your-
self. Don’t let bad policy
threaten, your credibility.
Change this policy that threat-
ens free speech and smacks of
unconstitutionality.

I would very much like to
read a reply to this, and let’s‘
hear rational reasons, if there
are any, for editing sections out
of others opinions. The reason I
was given of not enough space
is not good enough. This edit- I
mg policy sounds like censor-
ship, though unintentional,
but a rose is a rose. I would also
like to see my letters reprinted
in complete form as they were
submitted. I don’t want to be
cut short.

Joe McCall dives over the pile for the first of Panther touchdowns.

Da wkins   Ties
 Record Despite
L a te Sta rt

By MARK A. SINDLER

The autograph-seekers swarmed
around him en masse. Ihey came
from far and near. It seemed like

every little half—pint in that locker —

room was clamoring for that
revered autograph. The signature
meant distinction, the mark of
excellence and unique bragging
rights.

The subject was Panther split
end Julius Dawkins. His 6-3, 187-
lb. frame rose above the chaos in
the Panthers’ locker room after
their 63-14 annihilation of
Louisville. Dawkins had earlier
hauled in a 41-yard touchdown
pass.

This first quarter catch did not
honestly make much of a difference
considering that Pitt scored eight
additional TDs.

But for Dawkins, the memory
will be relived for years. That play
tied him with former Pitt-great
Gordon Jones, who pulled in 21
career TD passes.

“At this point, I'd say, yeah, I’ve
come a long way," Dawkins said
afterwards. “I spent two years
getting started. To come along in
two years means something,
because it took Gordon four years.”

The record-tying TD did not
come with ease. The catch ended a
four play, 64-yard drive that started
out with Dawkins being double
covered.

Sandwiched between two
Cardinal defenders, Dawkins
outdueled right cornerback Frank
Minnifield and strong safety
Ellsworth Larkins enroute to six
points.

That TD catch was the first of
three receptions for Pitt’s deep-
threat split end who totaled 94
yards against Louisville. Dawkins
moved to fourth on Pitt's all—tirne
yardage list.

When asked whether he attained
anything of significance on that
sun-filled afternoon, Dawkins
spoke with an air of modesty about
him. _ ’

"It's not a ‘bigaccomplishment,"

he said, as he stood signing one ,

autograph book after another.

l.e§§.x¢a£-  -._:.re,:w3z,u§4 2{'y_t>c_zg;.e n}?{€:'

inatching

with 16 TDs all contributed to a
team effort. That means
something.

“I see itas helping the team so we
can win; and the same thing is

happening this year, the same old '

thing,‘I’m helping the team.

During 1979-80, Dawkins
recorded 16 receptions for 253
yards, but failed to score a
touchdown. Last year, he caught 46
passes, good for 16 TDs.

The fact that he tied Jones after
playing full—tirne for only a year
and a half’ indicates the talent he
possesses. He caught 20 TDs in
high school in less than two years.

“I feel good about it," Dawkins
said of his Louisville performance.
“It took me only one and a half
years and that's a personal
accomplishment. I’m»fortunate to
be able to do it in that period of
time.”

Goal or not, Dawkins came to
the Stadium Saturday oblivious of
the record.

“I came out today and was
concerned about beating
Louisville. All of us were thinking
about winning. You have personal
goals, and mine is helping the team
and helping us win.”

In fact, the rest of_the squad,
Dawkins said, was not aware of the
pending record. He said that no
one paid attention to it in the
papers, but were preocccupied
with how many TDs or how many

‘catches they were going to have

against the Cardinals.

Dawkins, a senior, is not
the pace he set last
season. To date, he has racked up
19 catches for 332 yards and five
TDs.

In offering a plausible
explanation behind this “off-
season," coach Foge Fazio pointed
out that the Panthers faced weak
defenses last year.

“There has been a difference
playing the first four or five games
this year," Fazio explained. “Their
defenses are tougher. That includes
teams like North Carolina, Florida
State and West Virgina.

“Against Illinois, Cincinnati

and South Carolina (last year),

Massacre:

Panthers

By BRIAN BALK

The skeptics who have
questioned the Panther offense all
year long sat quietly with their
mouths securely zipped last
Saturday afternoon. The Panther
offense came to life, trouncing the
Louisville Cardinals 63-14 before a
crowd of 53,017.

The offense didn’t just click, it
thundered, compiling 49 points
before halftime.

“Everything we did was right,”
said Coach Foge Fazio afterward.
“We played with a lot of poise and
character—and we just played

hard.”

This decisive victory enabled
Fazio to experiment and substitute
second team players.,It inspired the

Loyalty And Dedication

By BARRY ZASLOFF

A Pittsburgh columnist once
wrote, “You wouldn’t think
that after writing nearly 2,000 of
the damn things, I’d be sitting
here, stuck for a lead." I share
his sentiments. This is a story
of loyalty and dedication. My
apologies to the sports—minded
readers who are expecting the
regular column that appears
here. That‘ will return on
Wednesday.

Scott Dellett, assistant sports
editor of these pages, has ‘just
returned from surgery in which
a tumor was removed from his
leg. Actually, he never left.
Until the day of his operation,
Scott wanted to write stories. He
asked to cover a Pitt football
game the day beforeihe was to
enter the hospital. This,
knowing he'd have to walk

from the press boil to the locker
room afterward, which entails
testing every step in the Pitt
stadium.

John Craig, editor of the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, once
said that loyalty is an important
factor in deciding who gets
hired. If such is the case, Scott is
on a level with The New York
Times.

The sports desk was short on
copy the day after Scott's
operation. “If you can get a
typewriter up here," he said,
“I’ll write a story." He was dead
serious.

For that entire week, Scott
offered to help in any way he
could. It was a display of
dedication that Craig can only
hope to receive from his
employees.

To those who know Scott, the
show of loyalty wasn't that

, saying, “Where's the headlines."

surprising. Need a story to fill...
space, and he does it.-Tell him
to leave \early on a deadline
night, and he refuses. Ask him
to complete the tedious task of
typing headlines, and he
obliges -in a manner that
suggests he’s actually enjoying
himself. He's always at that
dreadful headline machine
performing the task that
everyone else passes on.

The night before the
operation—a deadline night I
called Scott. “liellett, get down
here, the headlines are ready.”
He laughed, probably more on
the inside than outside. I could
picture him grabbing crutches,
hopping past the doctors,
limping down Cardiac Hill and"
into The Pitt News’ office,

I could see it clearly.

By MARK A. SINDLER

The Lady Panther volleyball
team flew South this weekend
without quite knowing how to size
up the situation. This was a team
that had played schools from the
Northeast all season. There have
been duels against Penn State,
Syracuse, Georgetown...there has
been no mystery.

Before last Thursday, though,
Coach Shelton Collier’s squad
really did not have a concrete
theory about what to prepare for.
After all, North Carolina and
North Carolina State are Atlantic
Coast _Conference’s (ACC)
powerhouses, and Georgia and
Tennessee are formidable foes from
the Southeastern Conference
(SEC). «

What to do? Well, with the three
day tournament concluded, the
Lady Panthers have emerged with
a respectable 3-1 match record.
Hiking their seasonal mark to 36-5.

“When we came down here, "
Collier said, “we had two purposes
in mind. One was to continually
prepare for the Big East’s and the
NCAA’s. Our team understood
that they needed to play well, and
we accomplished that.

“Secondly,” he continued,
“there was the importance of
defending against big-name
programs. These are prestigious
programs.”

After handily defeating NCSU
Thursday evening, 15-4, 15-5, 15-4,
second-ranked (SEC)
Tennessee Friday. Although the
teams started on an equal basis, the
Volunteers went on to win, 16-18,
15-11,11-15,17-19.

“Tennessee and Pitt are two top,
evenly matched volleyball
programs,” Collier explained.
“Losing by scores of 16-18 and 17-
19 certainly shows we're identical.”

Collier continuedto elaborate
on_how the other two games could
have changed theoutcome. The
Lady Panthers had defeated
Tennessee earlier at Pitt—one
indication of how the home-and-
away element can offset
similarities between teams.

Freshman Sally Gillespie agreed
that the slightest opportunity
could have tipped the balance to
either side’s advantage.

“Their team is pretty equal,” she
repeated of Collier’s remarks. ‘‘It
was the sort of thing where the
match could have gone either way.

There is no way we lost anything,
though. We gained experience that
was valuable and worthwhile.”

If the Tennessee contest hadn't
drained the energy from Pitt, the
ensuing performance against
Georgia would surely take its toll.
In a match that took “a grueling
two hours," the Lady Panthers
spotted Georgia two games.

“The (Georgia) match was the
one with the most discussion,"
Collier said. “Georgia entered with
a 36-3 record and Pitt was 34-5. The
match turned out to be very
exciting and was a pressure packed
comeback for us.”

After two close losses, Collier
pulled his team off the court and
into a nearby gymnastics facility.
Pep talk time. One more loss and
the match would be Georgia’s.

“We sat down,” Collier
explained, “and tried to regroup.
Georgia had a lot of momentum
then. They were emotionally up,
and we were down.”

Collier told his players to take
the floor as if it were the first game.
He wanted the squad to play as if
the match had just begun.

“Some players were not playing I

well," Collier explained. “I told
them to block out the past and put
on a new game face. I told them to
go in with the goal to win 3-0."
Collier’s initial intent was to
relax the team. He wanted to get

away from the boisterous crowd
and Georgia. The Panthers
ordinarily play effectively during
first game matches, but often,
poorly when under pressure.

Tension or not, the Lady Pan-
thers came back to defeat the Bull-
dogs, 13-15, 14-16, 15-9,15-5, 16-14.

North Carolina was Pitt‘s final
victim, 15-10, 15-12, 15-9.

With these matches against top-
notch schools behind them, the
Lady Panthers can now evaluate
what the contests meant. Gillespie
succinctly phrased an analysis of
the weekend encounters: “The
teams were different. We had to
prove to them what we're tough.
We had a lot to prove, and we did."

GAMES SERVES: Senior Diane
Zack once again led the team with
61 kills. Collier afterwards
commented on his star senior: “She
is a dominant spiker, and we
designate our offense to set her up a
lot....” Collier is slowly integrating
Ulana Kohutiak back into his
lineup. While recoving from her
eight-week-old injury, Kohutiak
was not able to play at 100 percent
this weekend due to the quality of
opposition,....C0lliet', on senior
Robin Kukalis, who had 45 kills:
“She literally dominated the
second half of the Georgia match
by consistently crushing spikes.
She is living up to her potential.”

DO YOU WANTTO KNOW
THE FACTS ABOUT  

ABORTION?

 

By MARK A. SINDLER

Like sweeping dirt under the
rug, the issueof the proliferation of
’ drug misuse in the NFL has been
shelved indefinitely after the
athletically-competent players
thought they had a legally
competent case against their bosses
and went on strike after the
league’s second week of play.

Yep, that is the way it has been.
No one ever heard of the NFLPA
actually going so far as to take its
wage scale to court. It was a total
rarity with relation to years past.
‘The NFL never had any labor
conflicts, save for the 1974 summer
camp lockout.

As a result of the,NFLPA’s latest
blasphemy———calling a walkout six
weeks ago tomorrow—-the front
pages of newspapers have been
covered with talk of strike.

Nothing else has ever come out
of Pete Rozelle’s Park Avenue
offices. .What happened to the
stand off between Oakland/L.A. Al
Davis and the 27 other owners?
What’t it going to be-—the Raiders
of Oakland or Lgs Angeles?

Through the media, we were
told about everything, from the
underarm deodorant of NFLPA
president Gene Upshaw to the
brand of running shoes of
management council’s Jack
Donlan (He jogs every morning.).
OK, but it seemed that way.

So, while we were being
bombarded with these little
idiosyncracies, the drug
controversy, started when former
Dolphin Don Reese told all to
Sports Illustrated in ‘]une,‘has all
but died.

It hasn’t? Perhaps this heated
issue is still contested, but there has
not been any memtion of any NFL

The Pitt News, Monday November 1, I982

Drug Use Out Of Focus <

drug-related problems in the
media, save for Reese’s going to
prison lately for probation
violations.

The fuss created over drugs in
football is not a minor one. It
deserves to be placed under the
lights because of the impact that it
carries.

 

In short, to have even a hint of
the presence of illegal substances in
the NFL, let alone the confirmed
occurrence, is sinful.

These pros (Can they still be
called that?) are paid six- ‘and
seven-figure salaries because they
play in an entertainment business
that attracts similarly big bucks. It
appears that the players are taking
it upon themselves to destroy
themselves with cocaine, heroin,
booze—god only knows what else.

The facts are cut and dry. Chuck
Muncie did it with the white stuff.
Charles Rogers sniffed the snow-
he reportedly invested over $10,000
into it. Minnesota’s Tommy
Kramer was admittedly into the
booze scene before he decided to dry
out.

In light of this, many spectators
who watch these “pros” perform
on Sunday afternoons and Monday
evenings, say that the players
should lead their lives as they so
desire. Accordingly, what they
shove up their noses or throw down
their throats is their own
business—no one else’s.

So much for the prestige and
promise that a major league sport
like pro football supposedly
upholds. So much can also be said
for those same spectators-——they are
not worth the paper their birth

certificates are made of.

Instead of standing behind this
indifferent attitude, these
spectators can join many other
people who are not so apathetic
and help professional ballplayers
like Darrell Porter, catcher of the
recently-crowned world champion
St. Louis Cardinals.

Porter admitted to an alcohol
problem some years back and was
helped out with rehabilitation. He
made it. People cared about his
career-threatening disease. Porter
kicked the liquor habit.

Porter earned World Series MVP
honors, signifying that he was the
best player in the series.

If he can be reformed, the same
can be done for those feeble-
minded NFL’ers now on mind-
altering substances. They are not
performing up to their potential.
It probably even rubs offon players
around them. '

By uncovering the drug episodes
of those players in the NFL, there is
more of a chance of owner-backed
rehabilitation programs and
assistance. By stopping the illicit
drug use in one sport, the more the
possibility of the same in other
sports.

Unfortunately, though, the drug

issue is not a forerunner right now. .

No, instead the wage scale and the
55 percent ideals are more relevant
to the newspapers.

Too bad, huh? You bet. There
used to be nine- and ten—year-olds
who worshipped, idolized,
professional , athletes because of
their talented performances on the
field. ‘

Now, these same youngsters will
be looking up to drug pushers,
dealers and people who look for
artificial highs. Ultimately, that
will be when sports reach a new
low.

25;?”

Slaughter

Louisville

continued from page nine

The Panthers scored first when
tailback Joe McCall wedged over
the goal line. It was the first of a
long string of touchdown marches
by the Panther squad.

The second TD romp came only
three minutes later. The Panthers
took possession at the Louisville
41. Immediately, quarterback Dan
Marino threw deep. Although split
end Julius Dawkins was double
covered, he out maneuvered the
defenders in the end zone.

“They took the outside away
from me, so I decided to go inside,”

' Dawkins said.

Indeed, Marino opened the
offense, no doubt a reflection of
Louisville’s slow-paced secondary.

“Any time a secondary allows
holes as Louisville did, we are
going to take all they will give us,”
Marino explained. The Cardinal
secondary had many holes.

The next Panther score came
after Louisville quarterback Dean
May pitched to his tailback Greg
Hickman. When cornerback Troy
Hill collided with Hickman at the
line of scrimmage, and jarred the
ball loose. The ball was smothered
by Dave Puzzuoli on Louisville’s
four-yard line.

Pitt scored on the next play,
when McCall swept right for the
touchdown. This TD increased
Pitt’s lead to 21-0.

The Cardinal’s bad luck
continued into the next series as
Hill intercepted a pass intended for
flanker‘Mark Clayton. Marino hit
flanker Dwight Collins on the
three. On the next play, Marino
escaped a Louisville blitz and
connected with tight end Clint
Wilson for the touchtown.

Again, Louisville failed to move.
They were at the point of
humiliation. Thomas took a hand-
off, cut east to west, spun and
carried the ball to the Louisville

  _one.

“It was purely an instinctive
run,” said Thomas. “When you get
into the secondary, one of the
biggest emphases the coaches put is
never let a defensive back bring you
down in open field.”

Thomas then popped into the
end zone virtually untouched.

One of the highlights of the
afternoon came when free safety
Tom Flynn took a punt, found a
wall and broke loose for a 63-yard
touchdown run.

“What happened is that we set
up a wall on theleft side of the
field," Flynn explained. “It just
happened that he kicked the ball
on the left side of the field. After
they blocked the,Cardinal head-
hunters, there was nothing but
blue shirts and green grass.”

With the score now 42-0, Fazio

“ knew the game had been decided.

New faces departed from the Pan-
ther bench. The second team
offense proved almost as effective
as the first team. With senior
quarterback Dan Daniels calling
the plays and freshman backs
Darnell Stone and Bill Callahan
rushing like they were seniors, Pitt
drove deep into Louisville
territory. Then,‘ from the one,
Daniels plunged over the pile for
another six.

The second team defense did not

,_ display as much control as its

offensive counterparts. The
inexperience was evident when
May drove 80 yards, connecting
with Clayton in the end zone for
Louisville’s first store.

positions; for example, flanker
. Collins played at the tailback slot.
I S The switch didn’t come as a
 - surprise to Collins, though. He
started at tailback for his Beaver

I   Falls High School team.

“We experimented with Dwight
Collins at tailback,” Fazio said.
“We are trying to utilize personnel
as much as we can.”

Callahan was one of the second
team players to see action for the
first time.

“I was happy to play,” Callahan
said. “I really didn’t care what the
score was—I was just happy to get __
in and prove myself.” K

“It is great to get the younger
team members in because you
never know when you’ll need
them, Flynn said. “It is also good to
keep their spirits up. Most of these
guys were “All World” in high
school, then they come here and
wonder if they’ll ever play.”

The mood in the Pitt locker
room was different from previous
games——there was nothing
negative to harp on. As Thomas
said, “We did pretty well today, we
finally came together as a unit in
terms of running, passing and
blocking.”

Dawkins latched _onto four TDs

recording a team-high eight

Also under consideration is the
injury sustained by then
sophomore flanker Dwight
Collins. His injury gave Dawkins
an opportunity to be on the
receiving end of Dan Marino’s
passes.

“Julius was fortunate,” Fazio
said. “In ’8l, everyone knew
Dwight had a great freshman year.
Pitt rolled over a lot of teams and
Julius came into his own. He’s a

Although most schools now slap
him with double coverage,
Dawkins is currently earmarked as
a dangerous deep—threat. He has
the potential to tear apart
opposing secondaries.

For autograph-seekers, though,
Dawkins will continue to be most
accommodating.
