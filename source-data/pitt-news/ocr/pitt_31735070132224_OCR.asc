It’s been almost two years since
16-year-old Brandy French, of
Sewickley, Pa., died from a negative
reaction to the drug ecstasy, which
she ingested at a rock concert in
Burgettstown, Pa.’

French’s death, from brain dam-
age wrought by a chemical reaction,
highlights the more immediate med-
ical dangers that the drug can bring
to those who use it.

Relatively little is known about
the long-term medical implications
of taking ecstasy, but a recently pub-
lished study found that the memory
functions of those who use it are at
particular risk. -

Selective Teach forAmerica program seeks applicants

DAN HENSLEY
Staff Writer

When 8-year-old Dirronnique entered Pitt alumna
Ami Magur1ia’s third grade classroom last year, she
could neither read nor write. In fact, Dirronnique — who
had lived in four cities before being abandoned by her
mother somewhere between the West Coast and
Baltimore, her current home — did not even know what
a sentence was. _

Such difﬁculties are common in Magunia’s school
district, where 70 percent of all black men drop out
before graduating high school. '

Since glaring lapses in low—income school districts
occur nationwide, Magunia, along with 10,000 other
recent college graduates, pledged two years of her life to
teaching in a low-income school district in one of 20
rural or urban regions across America She participates in
the Teach for America program. c

Magunia, who is teaching her second year in a
Baltimore grade school, visited Pitt’s campus and
described her experience in a presentation " Monday
evening in the Wrlliarn Pitt Union. ’ .

“It is a deﬁning moment,” Magunia said. “It affects
your views on politics, law, media — everything.”

Operating since 1990, Teach for America is a non-
proﬁt organization that provides recent college graduates
with the opportunity to teach in low—income communi-
ties for a two-year period. Desired applicants are not gen-
erally education majors; rather, the organization selects
students with top academic’ standings and proven leader-
ship skills, then trains them in an intensive summer pro-
gram before assigning them a school.

A participant continues to attend classes while teach-

ing and eventually receives certiﬁcation within the state
iniwhich he taught. pi e

In exchange for their commitment, participants in
the program receive the same base salary and beneﬁts as
other starting teachers — a salary determined and paid
for bythe individual school districts. Teachers can also
defer qualifying student loans for the two-year period,
and Teach for America pays for interest
accumulated on Federal loans during

participants because of the communica-
tion, strategy planning and resource
management skills they have gained,
Magunia added.

' But the true gains are intangible,
according to Magunia. During her pre-
sentation, she and two alumni of the program, Beth
Calcaterra and Arthur Wolfson, described the impact the
program had on their lives. Calcaterra described how the
experience led her to her current occupation as an attor-
ney for Kids Voice, a non-proﬁt organization providing
legal support for children of low—income families in
Allegheny County. She found that Teach for America
gave her the “chance to affect systemic change for kids
with special needs.” .

All speakers Monday night warned that the task is

challenging. Out of about 75 applicants in the two years
that Pitt has been involved in recruitment, only about two
have been accepted each year, according to Nancy
Reddy, the Pitt coordinator for Teach for America. The
program seeks proven student leaders from student orga-
nizations, private jobs or volunteer work, as well as moti-
vated and challenge-oriented individuals. Although the

base QPA requirement is a 2.5, the -

national average is closer to 3.5.

As for Dirronnique, the third grader in
Magunia’s class, Magunia gained her
confidence and built trust. She was then
able to devote time before school, dur-
ing lunch and after school to practice
phonics. At home, Magunia recommended Hooked on
Phonics to Dirronnique’s aunt and uncle, her guardians,

and she said she eventually saw progress.

Once Dirronnique moved on to the fourth grade,
Magunia was unsure that all Dirronnique had learned

ry problems. The study results report-
ed that users of ecstasy and marijua-
na were deteriorating the cognitive
functions of the brain to the point of
creating a “time bomb” of later-life
memory repercussions,

The‘ study was conducted using
an online questionnaire, which
encouraged participation from those
ecstasy users who might feel uncom-
fortable with a face-to-face study
concerning their use of a widely ille-
gal drug.

While study researchers pointed
out that as many as 2 million ecstasy
tablets, with their distinctive assort-
ment of colors and logos, are con-
sumed each weekend in the United
Kingdom, the Pittsburgh area is also
familiar with the drug.

Forty people have been charged
with involvement in connection to the
international drug distribution net-
work that oversaw the smuggling of
thousands of tablets of ecstasy from
labs in Europe to Pennsylvania desti-
nations in Pittsburgh, Altoona,
Indiana and Philadelphia, as well as
destinations in other states.

According to Shirley Haberman,
who is health education administrator
for Student Health Services at Pitt,
use of ecstasy and other hallucino-

I gens by Pitt students is nowhere near
. as widespread as alcohol or marijua-

na use on campus.

A campus-wide survey by
Student Health Services in the spring
of 2000 was the last time the office
examined the specific extent of ecsta-
sy use at Pitt. Of the students who
participated in the survey, 13 percent

said they had tried ecstasy in their

lifetimes, with 9 percent saying they

had tried it in the last year, and 3 per-

cent saying they had done it in the
previous month. _

' “As far as current use, I’d say it’s
very, very low on campus,”
Haberrnan said. “I think, judging by
the cases we deal with, that [use] has
probably remained relatively stable
[since 2000] and hasn’t gone very
much up or down.”

First synthesized in the early 20th

century, with uses as an appetite sup-'

pressant, MDMA was made illegal in
the United States in 1985, but its
many chemical variations, from
tablet to tablet, have made it notori-

ously difficult to pin down just what
ecstasy is, legally, as well as medical-
ly.

The high court of the Netherlands
—— the nation that is Europe’s largest
producer of ecstasy — ruled that for-

'eign dealers of the drug cannot be

extradited to other countries for trial
unless the request includes an exact
chemical formula for the ecstasy in
legal question that matches one
deemed illegal under Dutch law.

Thus, while much of the ecstasy
on the world market is of the MDMA
family, there ‘are numerous variants
ﬂooding club and party scenes.
Makers interested in staying ahead of
the chemical definition of the law
intentionally create these variations.

_ These unknown quantities raised
enough concern among users in the
United States, andlabroad, to necessi-
tate the creation of “harm reduction”
organizations, which look to make
available health and safety informa-
tion and supplies to people partying
at clubs, raves or other events.

From July 2001, until it “ran out
of funding” on October 28, 2003, the
Web site EcstasyData.org, which
emerged from the California-based

harm reduction group DanceSafe,
provided free access to lab testing for
people who wanted to send in sam-
ples of their particular tablets to find
out the chemical composition. The
group posted results and pictures for
all to see. .

The wide chemical variety and

numerous impostors have hindered ‘

previous attempts at defining,
through projects like the Newcastle-
led study, the impact of long-term use
of the drug on cognitive functions
like memory. , 4

Lead study researcher Dr. Jacqui
Rodgers, of Newcastle upon T‘yne’s
school of Neurology, Neurobiology
& Psychiatry, commented .on’the
problems of defining the long-term
effects of such a chameleon-like
drug.

“We all know of cases where peo-
ple have suffered acutely from the
use of ecstasy,”, Rogers said.

“But relatively little is known

‘ about the more subtle effects on the

increasing number of regular users-
worldwide,” Rogers added. “We
don’t really know what the long-term
effects of ecstasy use will be,’ as it is
still a poorly understood drug.”

Abortion debate must focus

performed since Roe vs. Wade, a 1973
case that interpreted the right to an
abortion from the rights, guaranteed in
the Constitution. - -

“There” would be one—third more
of our generation if there were not
abortions,” Fortunato said.

Fortunato also revealed that, as of
2001, there had been 43,358,592 abor-
tions inithe United States. She tried to
cut through what she said she sees as
obscure language used to hide the
facts of abortion, _ __

“When we have ‘to i talk about
abortion, we have to start with the
reality of people,” Fortunato said.

Describing her change from an
abortion-rights to an anti—abortion
perspective, Fortunato. spoke about a
mock presidential election in 1988
that occurred when she was in junior
high school.

She voted for Democratic candi-
date Michael Dukakis, she said, out of
the fear that voting for Republican
candidate George H.W. Bush would
cause women to die from back-alley
abortions.

Fortunato repeatedly spoke about
the personhood of the fetus, and how
it was no different from a person.

“No one is going to debate you
about [the fetus] being a life — it’s
been proven,” Fortunato said.

“We are definitely talking about a
human life. It’s not a different

species,” she added.

She spoke about Margaret Sanger,
founder of the Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, and said that
her target audience included young
women, poor women and women of
color. -

Fortunato quoted Sanger as say-
ing, “All of our problems are a result
of over-breeding of the working
class.”

“Although she might not have been a
eugenicist, she definitely had eugeni-
cist friends,” Fortunato said.

The Planned Parenthood
Federation of America’s» Web site
explains Sanger differently.

“Margaret Sanger was not a racist,
an anti-Semite, or a eugenicist,”
according to the Web site.

Fortunato also spoke about the
need to make the act of carrying a
child to term more socially and eco-
nomically acceptable.

“We need to make it a positive
thing for women to have their chil-
dren,” Fortunato said.

Fortunato also discussed the
Planned Parenthood Federation of
America, saying that the group has
made financial gains from abortions.

“They are a non-profit [organiza-
tion], but they made $660 million in
revenue -—- about one—fourth of it from
abortions,” Fortunato said.

“They are clearly a special inter-
est. They are clearly a business,” she
added.

Fortunato tried to end on a posi-
tive note, speaking about the impor-
tance of what her group does. She also
described how the organization affects
those it targets. , ’

“We do no small thing in protect-
ing the smallest in our society,”
Fortunato said.

Both Johnson and Fortunato faced
questions about the specific views of
their respective organizations.

When asked about Beautiful
Choice’s views on sex education in
school, Johnson stressed that the orga-
nization is extremely new, and that the
club will be decide such things in the
future.

“We haven’t gotten that far, since
we just started. It’s something we
would consider in the future,”
Johnson said.

Sarah Zangle, a sophomore at Pitt
and vice president of Beautiful
Choice, explained the various options
that are open to women who decide to
carry their pregnancies to term. V

“Adoptions are always a choice, if
you decide to do that. There are
resources out there and people who
will help.” Zangle said. »

Fortunato answered question
about the graduate anti—abortion
group, Do Not Harm, and their views
on programs to help the mother and
child after the birth. ’

“I think that all social services that

people need to have their babies, we v

support,” said Fortunato, mentioning
“care centers” that provide housing,
pre-natal care, clothing and toys.

“There are more care centers in
the United States than there are
Planned Parenthood clinics,”
Fortunato said.

Fortunato explained that sex edu-
cation in school is only effective when
done properly. She‘ described proper
sex education programs as those that
encourage abstinence, instead of con-
traceptive methods.

“I think we send teens the wrong
message when we send a mixed mes-

' sage of sexuality. The most consistent

message [to] teens is one of absti-
nence,” Fortunato said,

When asked about the future goals
of the group Beautiful Choice,
Johnson described a local focus.

“For now, we just want to make a
difference on campus and around the
city of Pittsburgh,” Johnson said.

“We will take on the worldlater.”

FCCmay fine Clear Channel for“Bubba”

The Federal Communications
Commission armounced its highest pro-
posed ﬁne ever — possibly charging Clear
Charmel Communications $775,000 for
broadcasting segments that the commis-
sion ruled obscene and indecent.

“Bubba the Love Sponge,” a Florida
radio show, apparently ran segments the
FCC found were “designed to pander to,
titillate and shock listeners,” according to
the Associated Press. And it ran these seg-
ments 26 times.

What both the court and public views
as obscene has changed over ﬂie past 50
years, as court rulings have deﬁned and
redeﬁned what qualiﬁes as obscene.
There’s a three-pronged test and pages of
legal precedent to absorb, but what it boils
down to is this: If a show has any scientif-
ic, artistic or otherwise redeeming merit
— even if it’s sexually explicit — it’s not
obscene.

“Bubba’s” Web site has a feature
called “Dong of the Day,” so it’s probably
best not to discuss potential scientiﬁc
merit.

But whatever the Web site says, the
FCC was right to rule that it’s not appro-
priate on the air. Despite the usual argu-
ment is that obscenity rulings are obsolete,
and that parents, rather than the govem-
ment, should decide what kids listen to,
the ruling was fair.

There are no parental controls on
radio, other than parents carefully moni-
toring every moment of their children’s

day — an impossible task to ask of any-
one —— and it should come with the guar-
antee that airwaves be free of true obscen-
ity. Note that “Love1ine,” the sometimes
graphic, but still informative, radio show
——- which later would become a television
show :— was never bothered by the FCC.
Clearly, there is a stark line between infor-

mation and obscenity. '

And now Clear Channel is challeng-
ing the ruling, calling for the consistent

community standards for what is considm

ered obscene.

Sorry, Clear Charmel, but the stan-
dards are consistent —— there’s a clear stan-
dard for what’s obscene, and the FCC
applies it fairly, as shown by another sim-
ilar ruling.

For instance, it ﬁned Young
Broadcasting of San Francisco, Inc. for
airing a television segment on KRON 4
Morning News where a man — a per-
former with the show “Puppetry of the
Penis” — exposed himself. The FCC
claimed that such an act would be foresee-
able, and it would be, given the nature of
the show.

There is a difference between obscen-
ity and art — people attending “Puppetry
of the Penis” know what they’re getting
themselves into; people tuning for the
morning traﬁc report don’t. Making such
distinctions isn’t a threat to free speech;
instead, it shows the merit of permissible
speech, which is something even Bubba
the Love Sponge should appreciate.

Don’t take seat-stealing sitting down

When I started thinking about this
column, some bitch was sitting in my
seat. With more than 100 seats to
choose from, she chose mine. I’ve sat in
that seat every class this semester
except one —- which I only missed
because all on-campus residents get
HBO now. Yet this girl decided to take
my seat. ‘ . L

Please allow me to backtrack for a
second. ,, While I don’t
remember her name, I
remember meeting this girl
some time ago in another
class. And I hated her even
before she stole my seat.
The fact‘ that I already hated
this girl makes the seat-
stealing incident that much
worse. The only thing I real-

when it is acceptable to steal seats?

If it doesn’t seem like a big deal, 

you haven’t considered the chain reac-
tion. When said girl took my seat, I was
forced to take someone else’s seat.
Someone else was then forced to take
yet another person’s seat. This reaction
could potentially affect most of the
class. ‘
It affects all types of people too.
The smart kids might
not be able to sit in the
front row, severely
damaging their educa-
tion. The average. kids
might get forced into
the front row, branding
them geeks. Or, in my
situation, I might not be
able to get the same

young ladies.

hatred, is that she wants to
— and believes she will -
become a famous actress, which proba-
bly means she’ll become an anonymous
waitress. ‘
Now that I got that off my chest, I
can return to the subject at hand. During
freshman year, a professor of mine pon-
dered about how students usually sat in
the same seat every class. After the
smart kids gave their smart-kid theo-
ries, I explained to him that the reason I
did was because I didn’t want to take
anyone else’s seat. I was called a smar-
tass —— which was much more compli-
mentary than the “incompetent” I
received later in the semester — but I
was serious. V
I would never intentionally take
someone’s seat. Admittedly, I am one of

the biggest jerks you’ll ever meet. Yet 0

even I would balk at the idea of seat
stealing. The act surpasses rude and
moves right to barbaric and savage.
What- sort of a society are we living in

My point is: Situations
like this are potentially
hazardous to all of us. While I know
that this column just recently brought
this problem to the attention of most
readers, please don’t panic. Yes, it is a

young thinker that I am, I believe we

body — except for athletes, because
they don’t go to class —— we can use this
as a chance to unite, Regardless of race,
age, gender, religion or sexual orienta-

the people who steal seats.

If I could turn back time, I would
have looked at that aspiring actress
who’s never going to make it anywhere,

Once criticized, King’s views onreform now whitewashed

As President Bush solemnly com-

Amemorated the legacy of Dr. Martin

Luther King, Jr. by placing a wreath at his
Atlanta grave site four days before his hol-
iday, I could not help but feel relieved that
irony was indeed still alive and kicking.

—Whether he knew it or not, our fair
President was honoring a man Whose ide-
ology was so contrary to his own that their
value systems got more beef with each
other than KRS-One and Nelly.

. The reason why Bush may not be
aware of what his gesture implied is
because King’s legacy has been selective-
ly ﬁltered to the extent that -he is an accept-
able ﬁgure for those from nearly all parts
of the political spectrum. After all, by con-
temporary standards King’s struggle for
racial harmony, desegregation and voting
rights for blacks sounds anything but rad-

_ ical.

But to characterize King’s legacy by
thoseissues alone — as has become nor-
mal practice in U.S. media outlets and his-

of thought that would transform the per-
ception of King from a moderate, Nobel

. Prize—winning, acceptable alternative to

Malcolm X’s rnilitancy to, as The
Washington Post stated in the late ‘60s, a

p man who “diminished his usefulness to his

cause, his countiy, [and] his people.”

The cause of this catastrophic change.
in King’s acceptability to the power struc- .

t11re lies in the fact that he moved beyond

race to the ultimate taboo in American‘

political discourse: social class.

Having" succeeded with the passage of
civil rights legislation, King next focused
on structural issues of poverty and the
underlying motives of U.S. foreign policy,
as exempliﬁed in his 1967 speech
“Beyond Viet:riam.” ‘

King passionatelyvdenounced the U.S.
government — at the time involved in a
terrorist action in Vietnam in which it and
its South Vietnamese client state were
responsible for several million deaths and
a level of suffering unfathomable outside
of a Ja Rule concert.— calling that gov-
ernment “the greatest purveyor of vio-
lence in the worl 

A 2003 poll of citizens in a religious- .

ly and ethnically diverse group of 11
developed and developing countries, in
fact, found, the United States to be a
greater threat to world peace than Syria
and “Axis of Evil” members Iran and
North Korea. ‘ '

The United States, King continued,
was ﬁghting “on the wrong side of a world
revolution.” Furthermore, he raised con-
cems about “capitalists of the West invest-
ing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa
and South America, only to take the prof-
its out with no concern for the social bet-
terment of the countries.” . _

Sounds like the. Good Doctor might

have had a thing or two to say about the

House’s policy towards underdeveloped problems in U.S. society and a militaristic

Returning to the contemporary, the
problem is not that Bush or other reac-
tionary political ﬁgures commemorate
King’s birthday; cynical ploys to win

, votes are nothing new. The deeper issue is

that such an important ﬁgure can ﬁnd the
culmination of a life of social activism lost
forever down the memory hole, with the
media now preferring to completely
ignore and whitewash some of his most
signiﬁcant contributions.

Study finds schools still segregated

There are moments of personal
embarrassment 

For example, Howard Dean’s speech
following his poor showing at the Iowa
caucuses, which looked like something
between Tom Cruise’s “all I warma know
is who’s coming with me” I
ﬂip-out in Jerry Maguire,
and Macho Man’s regular
routine. Embarrassing, and, .
politically speaking, suici-
dal.

. and then, of course,
there are embarrassments.

While The Pitt News
featured dissenting opinions
on whether or not we here at
Pitt are living Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.’s dream, it
became apparent that, as a
nation, we are not. A recent national
study by the Harvard Civil Rights Project
found that school segregation in public
high schools has returned itself to rough-
ly the same level it was at the time of
King’s assassination in 1968.

The report ﬁnds that, since 1988 and
particularly in the last decade, resegrega-
tion has taken place across the nation, as
the courts decided that the integrationist
goals of the landmark Brown vs. Board
of Education decision had been achieved.

Speciﬁcally, the 1991 Dowell vs.
Oklahoma City ' Supreme Court ruling
authorized a return to neighborhood
schools — instead of continuing to

- require busing — even if it resulted in

resegregation, which marked a turning
point in the ill—fated trend. .

“We are celebrating a victory over
segregation at a time when schools
across the nation are becoming increas-
ingly segregated,” the Harvard report
concludes, citing that schools.’ composi-
tions are either overwhelmingly white or
overwhelmingly minority, but far from
successfully integrated. "

“The typical white student attends a
school where four out of ﬁve children are
white,” while the characteristic black or

Latino student attends schools with’

roughly a 30 percent white population.
Indeed, the percentage of black students

in predominantly white schools has.

steadily declined since the peak of inte-
gration: 44 percent in ‘88, 37 percent in
‘9.l, and a mere 30 percent in ‘01, the

 

Pedja Jurisic
Columnist

lowest since King’s assassination.

The fundamental question, then, is
how this division affects the quality of
education each student —— indeed each
group — receives when divided.

Even someone with a marginal
understanding of our educa-
tional system must concede
the fundamental importance
money and economics exert
on the quality of education

E one receives. In light of that
fact, and of the robust, con-
nection between race and
poverty this country contin-
ues to avoid confronting, the
impact of segregation on
education is evident.

’ The same Harvard
study reported that only 15
percent of segregated whiteschools were

“schools of concentrated poverty,” while

88 percent of “intensely segregated

minority schools” (less than 10 percent

white) were defined in the same way.

The more disturbing concern for me,
however, is not merely the staggering
gravity of the problem that the numbers
imply, but rather the absence of a serious
national or statewide discussion on these
and other issues concerning race.

We seem more than content turning a
blind eye to the advantages we continue
to enjoy as a white majority, and do so
unapologetically. If you disagree, ask
yourself, where on the list of national pri-
orities for the upcoming presidential
election is there a demand to address the
socioeconomic inequalities minorities
continue to experience? Where does it lie
on your own list?

Social progress is a long, arduous
struggle. Failing to achieve social‘ and
economic equality swiftly is not an
embarrassment in and of itself. But enter-
ing the 21st century as the wealthiest
nation the world has witnessed, and
doing so with a climate of racial inequity
certainly is. Ignoring silently our regres-
sion towards Plessy vs. Ferguson — the
miserable decision that established the
“separate but eq 7’ principle — is hard-
ly living a dream. Instead, it is a shame-
ful nightmare of our current state of fail-
ure in race relations. I

Remember being 11, 14 or 17

A few years back, Hanson took

infectious and arguably irritating
hit single “Mmmbop.” Boys gasped
with horror when they found out
that lead singer Taylor Hanson was

not a female and girls could not get

fast as they burst into the limelight,
Hanson seemed to disappear into
the obscure black hole that sucks up

to nothing but their musical soul. A
small number of fans were invited
into the studio as the band recorded
the album. The track “Underneath”
is a strong, soulful reminiscence of
a love left behind by growth and
change, beginning with a bluesy
harmonica and progressing into a
heartfelt longing. With lyrics such
as “I fear I’m losing you beneath
my skin, what is the resolution for
this pain that I’m in. Sitting all
alone in this place, even though
we’re here face to face, there is
nothing gone, but there’s something
wrong,” it is clear that there are
deep feelings behind their lyrics,
drawing from personal experience.

Off The Wire: Golden Globes offer veryfew surprises

KYLE BURTON
The Lariat (Baylor U.)

(U-WIRE) WACO, Texas - This
year’s Golden Globes left viewers
with little to remember.

The more creative recipients of
the awards in the past have enter-
tained with tactless yet entertaining
displays, such as protests, like in
1973, when Marlon Brando refused
his award to protest American for-
eign policy. .

Nothing nearly as scandalous
happened this year.

One of the attractions of the
Golden Globes is the celebrity
antics. -

Each year, the Hollywood
Foreign Press Association votes on
its favorite American movies and
television shows. _

All the nominated actors, direc-

tors and producers then attend the
Beverly Hills Hotel for dinner and
lots of alcohol. ’

Before they even have time to
sober up, the show starts, and the
party begins. A

According to some critics, it
seemed the guests weren’t the only
ones drinking that night.

Bill Murray beat Johnny Depp in
the Best Actor in a Comedy, and
“Lost in Translation” beat “Big
Fish” in the Best Musical or Comedy
category.

Murray’s award and the success
of his movie, “Lost in Translation,”
came as a shock to many critics,
especially “Pirates of the Caribbean”
fans who felt Depp was the main
reason that film was so popular.

_Other big winners came as less
of a surprise. ‘The newest “Lord of
the Rings” movie, “The Return of

the King,” won the Best Drama, the

Best Original Score and the Best
Original Song awards.

“Angels in America,” an HBO
movie, stood out, winning... four
awards, including the Best Mini-
Series or Made for Television
Movie.

Sean Penn won the coveted Best
Actor in a Drama award for his roll
in Clint Eastwood’s “Mystic River.”

Penn played the father of a mur-
dered daughter and the friend of a
sexually abused man.

“Mystic River” also earned a lot
of attention from movie critics such
as Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-
Times, who said, “River leads
moviegoers on a suspense—filled,
sometimes painful adventure marked
by great performances.”

Theron took up a different role
in “Monster” than her usual genre.
Her good looks, covered by makeup,

Movie critic Richard‘ Roeper
called Theron’s performance “the
best of the year.” .

“Sex and the City” star Sarah

Haitian celebration remembers an important journalist, activist

The Agronomist
Starring Jean Dominique

Directed by Jonathan Demme
~i‘ni‘n.‘r

To catch an update on current
events, we don’t have to think twice
about ﬂipping on the radio and tun-
ing into a local news station. But
for Haitian journalist Jean
Dominique, bringing information to
the people was “a risky business.”

Directed by Jonathan Demme
(“The Silence of the Lambs”), “The
Agronomist” recalls 'Haiti’s strug-
gle for freedom through the Voice of
Jean Dominique, a prominent radio

journalist murdered _for speaking

out against oppressive regimes.
Demme’s documentary, a tribute to
his good friend that took nearly a
decade to complete, traces two cen-

turies of power shifts and tl/1;/

efforts of one radg)/station’ t”6’pro-
mote governmental respect for law
and Human rights.

Dominique’s purchase of Radio
Haiti in 1968 marked the first time
a Haitian station broadcasted in ver-
nacular Creole. Radio Haiti was
accessible to the masses. Then,
Dominique braved the wrath of
President-for-Life Jean-Claude
“Baby Doc” Duvalier with his
unabridged reports of Haitian news,
along with the trials, of similarly
oppressed peoples in surrounding
lands. Forced to flee Haiti twice
during his career, Dominiqueﬁspent
the -periods in exile, anxious to
return to his country and continue
his vital works. ,

“The Agronomist,” though con-
centrating largely on the life of one
man, presents .a comprehensive,
engaging history of Haiti starting

.with its ‘liberation from Francein

1804. It’s often difficult to keep
track of the coups and who remains
in power at any given time. Though
interviews with Jean Dominiqueor
his wife, Michele Montas, keep the

~ message clear: power shifted vio-

lently and often, but with few posi-
tive results. V .

COI11

of its citizens is a strong focal point
of “The Agronomist.” The U.S.
occupation, from 1915-34, culmi-
nated with the election of Francois

“‘Papa Doc” Duvalier. And U.S.

intervention in 1986 assisted in the
overthrow of the dictatorial
Duvalier line it helped to’ instate.
Although former President Clinton
aided the return of exiled President
Jean—Bertrand Aristide in 1994,
Aristide’s successor dissolved

‘Parliament and commenced an arbi-
trary rule.

Demme’s usage of the talking-
heads format showcases
Dominique’s extraordinary talent as

an orator. Dominique earnestly and
passionately addresses the camera,
recalling the time he spent in jail
and his decision to purchase Radio
Haiti. After all, Dominique never
intended to be a journalist — he
was an agronomist, specializing in
plant genetics. 1
“The Agronomist” incorporates
horrifying footage of rebellions,
dictators rising to power, and the

bloody aftermath. Scenes of every-

day life in the fields or towns are

‘included, as well. Demme narrates

the archival footage with
Dominique’s old broadcasts, occa-
sionally cutting to the bullet-riddled

facade of Radio Haiti. The building
and radio equipment were often tar-
geted. And in April 2000, Jean
Dominique was shot to death inside
the station. 1 -

Demme matches the electric
voice of Dominique —— both in
interview and previous broadcasts
— with fast pacing and powerful
imagery. “The Agronomist” is an
informative, touching tribute to an
important figure in the Haitian
human rights movement. As Haiti
celebrates the bicentennial of its
independence, Jean Dominique is a
man well remembered.

Pitt picks up two wins in EWL action

ALAN SMODIC
Staff Writer

The Panther wrestling team turned in a clean
sweep last week in winning two Eastern
Wrestling League dual meets, improving their
overall record to‘ 6-4 and remaining unbeaten
amongst EWL opponents at 3-0.

Led by freshman Drew Headlee’s pin,
Pittsburgh won the final four matches against
Cleveland State to overcome a 16-6 Vikings lead
and win by a final of 24-15. Headlee got things
going again by ,pu1li.ng~-out a majordecision to
begin the meet with Virginia Tech, leading the
rest of the Panthers on the way to a 26-11 victo-
ry over the Hokies.

“These two wins were very significant for
us,” head coach Rande Stottlemyer said, “espe-
cially coming in the other teams’ gyms.”

Pitt 24, Cleveland State 15

Pitt found itself in a 16-6 hole with only four
matches to go against their EWL rival Vikings of
Cleveland State, but put together a strong run to

, knock off the Vikings 24-15.

The Panthers got off to a rough start

sophomore Justin" Nestor and junior Zach
Doll losing close decisions at the hands
of Cleveland State’s Jason Effner and
Matt Klinger at 157 and 165 pounds,
respectively.

“Both were upset with the losses, so
the team knew they had to pick them up,”
Stottlemyer said.

Pitt’s first points didn’t come until
sophomore Francis Iorfido gained an 8-6
victory over the Vikings’ Derek Pace.
Cleveland State countered right away
with a major decision in the 184—pound
match with Ron Howard’s victory over
Pitt freshman Eric Cassidy.

The two teams exchanged wins in the
next two matches when Pitt senior Josh
Birt got the decision over Joe Phillips
and Cleveland State acquired the match’s
first pin when Russ Davie pinned Pitt’s
Travis Shirley. The pin lengthened the
Vikings’ lead to 10 points with only four
bouts remaining. _

Pitt’s run began when Headlee
recorded the team’s only pin with a fall
at 4:09 over DeAngelo Penn. Mike Ciotti
followed Headlee’s lead, earning a
default victory over Kevin Linich of the
Vikings,-and a point was deducted from
the Vikings’ team score for unsportsman-
like conduct.

The Panthers never looked back once
they gained the lead at 18-15. Pitt’s
Ronald Tarquinio got the win over
Anthony Coleman, 4-2, in a battle of
nationally ranked wrestlers. Freshman
Matt Kocher closed out the meet by

improving his personal unbeaten-dual-meet
streak to nine bouts with a 7-4 overtime win over
Matt DePolo of Cleveland State.

“They did an excellent job of fighting back,”
Stottlemyer said. “Everybody chipped in, partic-
ularly after the first two losses. Headlee had a
great performance and Ronald’s overtime win
was big.” ‘

Pitt 26, Virginia, Tech 11

Pitt stayed tough in EWL action, picking up
a 26-11 victory over Virginia Tech at Cassell
Coliseum in Blacksburg, Va.

Pitt picked up right where it left off as
Headlee and Tarquinio got the Panthers started
quickly with a major decision and a pin in the
first three bouts for an early, 10-4 advantage.

Headlee scored a 10-0 major—decision Victo-
ry at 125 pounds for the Panthers’ first four
points. After a major decision loss by Ciotti,
Tarquinio pinned his opponent just 20 seconds
into the second period.

Kocher’s nine—meet winning streaketo start
his career was snapped by No. 25-ranked Reed
Carpenter of the Hokies by a score of 9-1. Nestor

bounced the Panthers back with a 3-0 win at 157

pounds to open up an overall lead of 13-8.
Virginia Tech picked up its final victory of the
meet when Chris Stith upset Doll by a 12-7
count in the 165-pound match.

Iorfido and Croyle earned back-to-back
wins, with Iorfido getting the 12-6 victory over
Steve Borja and Croyle following up with a 2-1
win at 184 pounds.

The Panthers also took the final two bouts of
the meet —— 12-4 majordecision for.‘Birt over
Canaan Prater at 197 pounds and an 8-3 victory
by Shirley over Kris Wiedegreen at heavy-
weight.

“We have a bunch of guys who work hard
and care about what they are doing,” Stottlemyer
said. “As long as we stay healthy, we’ll com-
pete.” C

The Panthers continue their season with a
trip to Morgantown, W.Va., to take on the
Mountaineers of West Virginia. _

“It will -be a backyard brawl. It will be inter-
esting,” said Stottlemyer. “But I’m really look-

ing forward to going down and having a great
chance of winning.”

Panthers return to the Pete to take on Boston ‘tCo11ege

KEVIN NASH
Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team’s task against
the Boston College Eagles will not differ from
what it has been over the past few games.

I Pitt will have to contain yet another high-
scoring big’ man, the Eagles’ leading scorer, for-
ward Craig Smith. Smith leads Boston College
(13-5 overall, 2-3 Big East) in scoring, rebounds
and blocks, as he averages 18.4 points and nine
rebounds per game while recording 21 blocks on
the season.

“You have to play great defense against all of
the big men in the Big East,” junior Mark
“We just have to outsmart
them.” _ . j -«

However, Smith is in a three-way tie for the
team lead in turnovers, with 38. The assignment
of guarding Smith will be a collective effort, as
was the case with Connecticut center Emeka
Okafor last Monday night.

“Smith presents a number of different prob-

' lems in containing him,” Pitt head coach Jamie

Dixon said. “We will use a number of guys [on
him] like we have been doing.”
The No. 6 Panthers (19-1, 5-1) will have to

‘rely on their physical play inside in order to

match up with Boston College, as its players
have a size advantage. Smith is 6-foot-7, 265
pounds, and forward Uka Agabi who is 6-foot-8,
262 pounds.

Agabi is the team’s third—leading scorer, with
an average of 11.1 points per game, behind 6-
foot-7 inch, 210 pound Jared Dudley, who aver-
ages 12.9 points per game.

Boston College is coming off of a 65-62 loss
at the hands of West Virginia on Saturday. The

. Mountaineers were able to hold Smith under his

average, as he scored only 15 points, but Dudley
scored 14 points, which is more than his season
average. 5 '

Guard Sean Marshall is the Eagles’ biggest
out-side threat. Marshall is a 34 percent three-
point shooter and averages 9.4 points per game.
He has taken nearly twice as many attempts from
beyond the arc than any other player on Boston
College. a

“They are very talented both inside and out-
side,” Dixon said. “From the stats, [Marshall] is
the best shooter from the outside. He is their
main threat.”

Pitt is coming off of a dominant performance ,
over the No. 20 Syracuse Orangemen. Freshman

center Chris Taft
was tied for the
team lead in points
with McCarroll;
each player scored
15. Taft also was
able to pull down
eight boards in the
contest and leads
Pitt in rebounds
with an average of
7.3 per game.

C he v o n
Troutman con-
tributed 12 points
and .led the
Panthers in
rebounds, with 11.
Troutman was able
to put back several
missed shots for e
the bulk of his
points ' against
Syracuse. _

The Panthers
out-rebounded the,
Orangemen 50-36
in the game ‘and
will need to play
with the same

physicality /that they played with against the
Orangemen. ‘

“[The players] understand the importance of
[rebounding],” Dixon said. “They are willing to
do whatever it takes to win.”

Guard Carl Krauser continues to lead the
Panthers in scoring, with an average of 15.1
points per game. Krauser also leads the team in
assists, with 78. _.

“We have to continue to play well together,”
Krauser said.’ “As long as we do everything that
our coach asks us, we will be fine.”

indoor track teams competed at the
Red Simmons Invite in Ann Arbor,
Mich. this weekend and_ came -away
with 14 top-three finishes combined,
including two ﬁrst-place ﬁnishers on
the women’s team. a A

“I think -we did as well as I expect-
ed,” said head coach Alonzo Webb.
“Nothing spectacular, but solid. I did-
n’t expect everyone to run great.
They’re still getting back in shape
from the four weeks off at break. I just
wanted to see their competitiveness.”

Members of the women’s team.

placed in the top three seven times,

ending up with two in first place, two»

in second place and three in third
place.  . p *

Kimberly Lyles placed first in the
200-meter dash with a time of 24.87
seconds, a full 0.4 seconds faster than
the second—place runner. " ‘

Trenace Elliot brought home the
only other first-place finish for the
Panthers. She dominated the 400 with
a time of 56.03 seconds, nearly 1.3
seconds faster than her nearest com-
petitor. V ‘ ' A , ' .

“Trenace Elliot ran really well,”
said Webb. ‘_‘From what we’ve’ seen in
practice, she’s ready to go to another
level.”

The two second—place finishers for
Pitt were Fatmata Fofonah and
Elizabeth Bayne. They both came in
with the exact same time in the 60-
meter hurdles — 8.61 seconds.

The only third—place finish for the
Panthers in the track events was the

4x400-meter relay team, which fin- e

ished with a time of 3:46.54.

In the field events, two Panthers
finished in third place. In the pole
vault, Marissa Dudek tied for third
with a height of 3.66 meters. The other
third—place finisher was Amanda
Walker in the shot put, throwing for a
distance of 15.17 meters. 1 _

The men’s team also had seven
top-three ﬁnishes, placing third six
times and second one time.

Korey Gross was the only Panther
who placed ‘second, recording a dis-
tance of 14.04 meters in ‘the triple
jump.

In the other field’ events, Justin
Clickett placed third in the shot put
with a personal-best distance of 16.30
meters, and Matt Brousse finished
third in the pole vault with a height of
4.76 meters. .

In the track events, the men’s

4x400-meter relay team placed third
with a time of 3:20.20.

The other third—place ﬁnishers for
the Panthers were Jeffrey Kiss in the
60-meter hurdles, with a time of 8.43
seconds, Jeryl Wilbom in the 800-
meter run, with a time. of 1:52.48 and
Troy Roberson in the 400-meter dash,
with a time of 50.19 seconds.

“Jeryl Wilborn ran a great race,”
said Webb. “I’m hoping that he can run
a provisional NCAA qualifying time
this weekend.” 5

The Panthers return to action next

weekend at the Penn State National I,

Open in State College.

“We’re going to be on a really nice
track, -[which should help us get] better
times,” said Webb. “The atmosphere is
always great, and the teams should be
good. This is where I expect to see our
best.”
