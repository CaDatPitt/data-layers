Student Government Board member Thomas
Jabro didn’t want to be a, lame duck at Tues-
day’s public meeting. , V

But it appeared to be duck hunting season .

as Board member Mike Nites shot down a
series of Allocations Manual revisions that
Jabro proposed.
Jabro attempted to introduce revisions
to the Allocations Manual last night, which
would allow the Board to fund for individual
membership dues —— such as chapter dues --
if they relate to the organization’s existence,
as well as to fund for child clearance and dis-
posable items that are not provided by the
Student Organization Resource Center ofﬁce.
Jabro’s proposed revisions would prevent the
Board from funding for the advertising efforts
of a student organization.

The Allocations Manual is the governing
document for the Allocations Committee and
outlines how the committee disseminates the
more than $2.3 million Student Activities
Fund. Every non-College of General Studies
undergraduate student is required to pay $80

Pittsburgh Parking Authority keeps eye on drivers

Staff Writer

Andrew Colaizzi lives in Mount Lebanon
and often rides the bus to campus. But
on days he drives, -he said he finds it
difficult to find a parking space because
many of the spaces are already taken.
Colaizzi, a junior accounting ma-
jor, said he doesn’t think information

about his vehicle movements or where
he parks his car should be recorded and
then accessible to the public.

rently uses three LPR cameras, and
the Parking Authority uses two LPR
cameras. ‘ . .
At the Pittsburgh Parking Author-
ity monthly board meeting, the board
members agreed to purchase three new

Plate—Recognition cameras, in addi-

tion to the two cameras the Author-
ity already have in use. According to
records of the board meeting listed on
the Pittsburgh Parking Authority web-
site, the board agreed upon the pur-
chase of storage server for the Plate-
Recognition cameras. The servers will
increase the storing-capacity of images
taken from the cameras. The storage
unit and three cameras will cost the
city around $25,000. ‘

The Parking Authority’s Parking
Boot and Tow program also uses the I
plate—recognition cameras, which are \
installed on the exterior of booting
operation vehicles to locate scofflaws,
or owners of vehicles who hold ﬁve or
more outstanding parking tickets.

According to Patricia Konesky, ex-
ecutive assistant of the Parking Author-
ity, there are currently about 4,000
uploaded license plate numbers be-
longing to scofflaws that are at risk of
being booted and towed. Konesky said
the unpaid parking tickets from these
scofflaws add to more than $2 million.

into the fund per semester. _
Afterjabro introduced his proposed revi-
sions, Nites, a former allocations chair, an-
nounced thatjabro did not have the authority
to revise the allocations because of section
6.02 of the Board’s constitution. This sec-
tion states that only the allocations chair can
propose revisions to the Allocations Manual.
After Allocations Committee Chairman

City officials keep the images from
the cameras on file for 30 days. Once
the driver does not pay the ﬁfth tick-
et after_the 30—dayPmark, the vehicle
license-plate number is uploaded by
the Parking Authority into the plate-
recognition system so that cameras
around the city can locate the scofﬂaw
and impound the vehicle._

Colaizzi, who is also a member of
Pitt Commuter Mentors, a group that
assists commuter students in adjust-
ing to their first year at college, said
thatthe plate—recognition cameras are
worrisome.

“I can understand why police need

to keep some of this information on '

ﬁle, but random strangers should not
be allowed to view [that information] ,”
Colaizzi said.

Colaizzi said the documents could
easily end up in the “wrong hands” and
that the information provided by the
images of the license plates and the
vehicle locations could potentially be
abused.

' He added that the public images
could allow strangers to follow or stalk

individuals through the information .

obtained from the cameras concern-
ing individual-s’ vehicle locations and
driving habits.

“The thing that I find most worrying
is that people can go to the place where
this information is stored and retrieve
it pretty easily,” Colaizzi said. V

David Onorato, the executive direc-

Alex Majchrzak conﬁrmed he had never
heard or seen the revisions before that mo-
ment, the revisions did not move forward.

“Well, that’s abummer,”]abro said during
the meeting. “Alex, sorry for not ‘cc-ing’ you
on that email.”

Jabro said after the meeting thathe did
not consult the constitution before propos-

_ ing the revisions, but sent an email with his

revisions to every Board member Sunday
night. None of the Board members expressed
concern aboutaconﬂictwith the constitution

tor of the Pittsburgh Parking Authority,
said the information recorded by the
plate—recognition cameras is not shared
on a regular basis.

“The authority does not share
[plate-recognition] information un-
less required by State of Pennsylvania

Right-to-Know stature,” Onorato said.
Elena Baylis, a law professor at Pitt,

said the plate—recognition cameras are
not a violation of constitutional rights
to privacy because the cameras record
the images of vehicle plateswithin a
public setting. She added that the city
government can legally use the public
information.

“If you choose to do something in the
street, or in another public area, you are
voluntarily acting where anyone can see

you,” Baylis said. “And so you have re-

linquished any reasonable expectation
that your activities will remain private.”
Baylis also said that if residents are
upset with the ‘use of the records from
the cameras, they can pressure offi-
cials to establish policies that prevent
authorities from keeping the photos
or the public from viewing the images.
According to the Pittsburgh Parking
Authority website, under the Right-to-
Know Law, residents can _write a request
to obtain Parking Authority records.
The request must be in accordance
with the guidelines of the law, and the
letter must indicate which record the
resident wants to access. Residents
must also clearly indicate on the writ-

before Nites’ announcement at the public
meeting.

Nites said he did not mention the con-
stitution sections to jabro before the meet-
ing because he was busy, had only browsed

' through the email quickly and didnotthink

about the subject again until the Board’s
meeting discussion at 8 p.m., just before
the 8:45 p.m. public meeting.

Nites said he only conﬁrmed that a Board
member’s proposal of Allocations Manual
revisions was against the constitution while

ten document whether the inquiry is a
Right-to-Know Law request.

Konesky said that Parking Authority
reviews and either approves or rejects
each Right-to-Know request within five
days of receiving it. The Parking Au-
thority bases decisions on the specific
circumstances of the requested infor-
mation and the individual’s reason for

- requesting the information.

If the Pittsburgh Parking Authority
agrees to the written request, staff will
mail a photocopy of the requested docu-
ment to the resident’s home. ’

According to the Parking Authority
website, the Parking Authority Board
also voted in September to monitor
Residential Permit Parking Program
passes with the plate—recognition sys-
tem. The authority can use the cameras
to locate parked cars that do not have
a valid parking pass for the location in
which they are parked.

Onorato added that the system en-
ables the Parking Authority to enforce
the 33 residential parking districts in
Pittsburgh in “a more timely and ef-
ficient manner.”According to Sergeant
Richard Begenwald, auto theft supérvi—'
sor for the Pittsburgh police, police can
also use the plate—recognition system to
track wanted or missing persons, stolen
vehicles, stolen, expired orsuspended
license plates and suspects from terror-
ist watch lists. '

he was rereading the document on the way to
the meeting at 8:45 p.m., but said he didn’t
have a speciﬁc reason for not informingjabro
of the conflict.

A For Nites, the rules were clearly outlined
in the constitution.

“I don’t think that it’s necessarily right to _

say that I should have said something earlier,”
he said. “How about we all just know about

what the rules are?”
Nites said he expressedto the Board dur-
ing the premeeting discussion that he thought

Jabro was rushing the changes and did not V

think the wording was clear.

Jabro conﬁrmed that Nites expressed con-
cern about the wording, but did not recall
Nites saying the changes were rushed.

During the premeeting discussion, Jabro
said he established that Tuesday’s public
meeting would be the last opportunity to
table the motion and discuss the proposed
revisionsfor aweek. _

Jabro said he did not initially approach
Majchrzak because he thought “it would be
best to consult people on the Board.”

“Sometimes, in my opinion, Alex doesn’t
see eye to eye with my ideas,” Jabro said. “I
thought we could discuss the revisions during
the tabling process.” .

Majchrzak said he did not think. he was
deliberately excluded from the email. '

He also said he would not be in favor of
most of the revisions because they would
change the current Allocations Manual to
reﬂect the opinions of a speciﬁc Board. A

Jabro attributed his motive to a person-
al “exuberance [that] came from trying to
continuously improve SGB and work for the
student body until the end of the semester,”
but said he assumed that people didn’t want
to tell him about the conﬂict in his proposal.

“On my own Board, I had a former chair
and former members of the Allocations Com-
mittee itself, and no one chose to bring it up
to me,”]abro said.

In other action:

Joe Kozak, Elections Committee chairman,
introduced proposed revisions to the Board’s
constitution and bylaws. The Board will vote
on the revisions to the Board’s bylaws at its
last meeting Dec. 3. Students will vote on the
changes to the constitution that will be listed
on the election ballot this Thursday.

The Board will host an openlforum about
possibly changing the Board’s structure on
November 25 at 8 p.m. in Dining Room B of
the Willi

Once the cameras indicate a hit for a

Within the past seven years, Pitts-

Ball also said he thinks authorities

Separation of church and state:
Has the pendulum swung too far?

Matt Barnes
For The Pitt News

As the holiday season approach-
es, I am reminded of an event that
took place two years ago in my
hometown of Ellwood City, Pa.

For more than 50 years dur-
ing the Christmas season, atradi—
tional nativity scene stood on the
lawn of the borough’s downtown
municipal building. In the past
few years, a group called the Free-
dom From Religion Foundation,
based in Madison, Wis., threat-
ened legal action to ensure the
creche’s removal. The group ar-
gued that the Christian display
on government ground violated
the Establishment Clause of the
First -Amendment. As time went
on, the pressure from the group
could not be ignored.

The controversy culminated in
December 2011, with a showdown
between the 8,000 residents of

the town and the freedom group. _

Council meetings were ﬁlled with
hundredsfof men, women and
children of the community, urg-
ing their council members to ﬁght
for their religious rights.

Itwas amazing to see the effect
one particular issue could have on
the citizens of a small Western
Pennsylvania town.

The Establishment Clause
states that “Congress shall make
no law respecting an establish-
ment of religion.” This has often
been interpreted as prohibiting
government from establishing a
recognized religious preference.
In the case of Ellwood City’s na-
tivity scene, it is undeniable that
the display on municipal grounds

gave preference and recognition
to Christianity. This raises avalid
question: Should a government
that touts itself as by the people
and for the people explicitly deny
the will of the people?

Because of the 14th Amend-
ment_’s Equal Protection Clause,
part of which states that “No state
 shall deny to any person within
its jurisdiction the equal protec-
tion of the laws,” most of the Bill
of Rights have been applied to the
states through incorporation, ap-
plying not only to the federal lev-
el, but also to the state and local
levels of government. Therefore,
Ellwood City, through a narrow
and abstract scope, seemed to
be legally obliged to remove its
municipal creche.

In December 2012, the bor-
ough did just that, though the de-
cision was difficult and remains
unpopular. The reality was that
the group would continue its ﬁght
until the town’s resources were
exhausted and its legal victory
was ensured.

Unfortunately, this episode is
indicative of modern outlooks on
church, state and the freedoms of
communities_across the country.
It was not an unjustiﬁed response
to a reasonable request. It was not
ignorant, unfounded or baseless.

Rather, Ellwood City is a mi-
crocosm, one that reveals an un-
fortunate trend spreading across
America —— that is, the trend fa-
voring the unreasonable will of
the few against the justiﬁed and
peaceful will of the many.

Similar instances have oc-
curred across the nation from
Santa Monica, Calif., to Canon-

sburg, Pa. In these various loca-
tions, nativity scenes are coming
down and people’s benevolent
values are being attacked.“

In 1989, the Supreme Court
decided in County of Allegheny
v. ACLU that a nativity scene in
the Allegheny County Courthouse
in downtown Pittsburgh was un-
constitutional. This issue has
reached across the country and
interfered with the traditions of
MiddleiAmerica.

The separation of church and
state is part of the foundation
upon which this country has been
built. The separation of church
and state, however, goes both
ways. '

The pendulum has swung
disproportionately in favor of
members of such groups as the

Freedom from Religion Founda- .

tion and away from members of
church— and faith—based groups
that constitute an overwhelm-
ing majority in traditional small
towns like Ellwood City.

It is true that the government
should refrain from mandating
a required religion. The First
Amendment’s Free Exercise
Clause continues the Establish-
ment Clause by reiterating that
“Congress shall make no laws
respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free

exercise thereof.”

Citizens are provided the right
to practice their religion peace-
fully and in the manner they wish.
If an overwhelming majority of
citizens in a small town wish to
enjoy a nonthreatening, benevo-
lent piece of art on a certain patch

of grass, no matter by whom it is owned,
they have and deserve nothing less than
the right to do so.

As previously mentioned, a legal argu-
ment can be made against the allowance of
such a scene. Those arguments, however,
tend to be narrow and subjective.

The residents of Ellwood City and of
other small towns across America are hard-
working people without time for petty ma-

November 20, 2018 I The Pitt News I vwvvv,pittnevvs.com

neuvering of constitutional clauses to jus—
tify the ridiculous claims that an innocent
nativity scene infringes upon nonbelievers’
civil rights. '

If every citizen was legally bound and
forced to accept Christianity as truth,
then the borough would be acting in an
unconstitutional manner because of both
the Establishment Clauseand Free Exer-
cise Clause. However, displaying a scene
that reﬂects the views of the majority of a
community’s members is not restricting
freedom, but celebrating it.

In fact, a borough’s municipal building
is the optimal place to represent the be—_
nevolent view of a group of its citizens. We
too often forget that another major founda-
tion upon which this country was built is
popular sovereignty. Government, when

_regarding’peaceful principles and values,
should" not dictate the will of the people.

Rather, the peaceful will of the people

‘ should dictate the actions of government.

If the time has come when a small interest
group from another state can come into a
community and dictate policy and action,

5

then the pendulum has swung too far in the
wrong direction.

The people of towns and communities
should have the greatest say in their re-
spective homes. ,

That is America. That is freedom.

That is government of the people, by the
people and for the people and shall remain
so as long as liberty and sovereignty are
foundations upon which we aim to build
the ﬁiture. I ‘

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Eyeing rebo

Dave Uhrmacher
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

On the heels of its ﬁrst loss of the season,
the Pitt women’s basketball team heads to
Ann Arbor, Mich., to take on the Michigan
Wolverines in a non-conference battle.

The Panthers and Wolverines tip off at
7 tonight at the Chrysler Center.

Pitt (2-1) suffered its ﬁrst loss of the
season Sunday when it dropped a non-
conference game at home to Lafayette
College for the second straight year, 48-
45-

This is the ﬁrst time Pitt will face a Big
Ten conference opponent since the 2011-
2012 team traveled to Cancun, Mexico,
Dec. 20 and 21'to face Indiana and Michi-
gan State. The Panthers won both games
by a combined 17 points.

Pitt has not played Michigan in more
than 20 years, with the teams’ last meet-
ing having occurred Dec. 19, 1992, when
Pitt prevailed 64-62. In three meetings
with the Wolverines, Pitt boasts a 2-1
record.

The same shortcomings of last year’s
Pitt team seemed to return Sunday in
the loss against Lafayette. The Panthers
struggled from the ﬁeld, shooting only
30.2 percent (19-63). They attempted
only 12 free throws in the game and woe-

fully converted on only six of those at-
tempts.

Lafayette out-rebounded Pitt head
coach Suzie McConnell—Serio’s team, 51-
43, with redshirt freshman Marvadene
“Bubbles” Anderson and junior Cora Mc-
Manus combining for only six rebounds
at the center position.

McManus played only seven minutes
after picking up four quick personal fouls,
forcing Pitt to continue without a center
for extended periods of time while An-
derson, who played a total of 20 minutes,
rested. 8'

The Lafayette contest also presented
Pitt with a break from the high volume of
foul calls to which the team had started
to adapt, given the new rules limiting
freedom of movement in women’s hoops.
Throughout the game, a total of 31 fouls
were called among both teams.

In its previous two games, Pitt had
seen a combined 84 foul calls and 70 free-
throw attempts. The continued adjust-
ment to the new rules, especially in the
front court, will be paramount Wednesday
for the Panthers. .

PlTT IN THE NFL '

Former Panthers

Sean Corrado
Staff lVrz'2fer

Philadelphia Eagles running back LeSe—
an McCoy’s league—leading rushing total
climbed to more than 1,000 yards in a
very impressive Week 11 at the profes-
sional level for him as well as for his
fellow former Panthers.

McCoy (Pitt 2007-2008) took 20 car-
ries for 77 yards on the ground against
Washington to raise his total rushing
yards on the season to 1,009. He also
crossed the goal line twice and caught

shine in NFES Week 1 1, Graham signed by Steelers

four passes for 73 yards to propel the
Eagles to a 24-16 victory.

Philadelphia fans, along with the
Pitt fan base, were scared to see McCoy
struggle to get up in the second quarter.
After taking the ball into the red zone,
he immediately took offhis helmet and
grabbed his right hamstring.

Despite whatlooked like a serious
injury, McCoy returned after halftime
and finished with 150 total yards.

The Eagles, who are now 6-5 on the ‘

year, currently have sole possession of
first place in the NFC East. They have a

bye next week, which will give McCoy
more time to rest his injured hamstring.

On the other hand, it will give sec— ‘

ond— and third-place rushers Marshawn
Lynch (925 yards) and Alfred Morris
(918) the opportunity to pass McCoy
for the rushing title.

Wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald (Pitt
2002-2003) helped his Arizona Cardi-
nals defeatjacksonville, 27-14, and ﬁght
back into the playoff picture. The Car-
dinals, who are now 6-4 on the season,
are only one game out of the second
wild—card spot.

Fitzgerald grabbed six passes in the
contest for 61 yards —— his highest total
since Week 6 — and added a 14-yard
touchdown in the first quarter.

Oakland Raiders guard Lucas Nix
(Pitt 2008-2011) has been an important
piece on the offensive line this season.
Nix and the rest of the line were able to.
protect undrafted rookie quarterback V
Matt McGloin, who_was only sacked
twice against Houston.

‘ACC. BREAKDOWN

"November 20, 2013 | The Pitt News I v\/vvvv,pittnevvs.com

A After top two squads, ACC umbled with middling teams 7’

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

With No. 2 Florida State and No. 7 Clemson
all but locked into the top two spots in the
ACC for the rest of the year, there isn’t much
to discuss at the top. X

The ﬁght for the third spot, however, is

much tighter, and the winner of that battle '
. most likely will represent the Coastal Divi-
sion against the Atlantic Division champion

Seminoles.

Duke topped Miami easily for its sixth"
consecutive win and Miami’s third con- ‘

secutive loss, but there are four teams with
three losses in the Coastal Division right
behind the Blue Devils.

Given Duke’s (8-2) relatively easy
schedule, no one thinks the team could
give Florida State a run for its money in the
title game. That said, someone has to play
the Seminoles in Raleigh, and Duke might

just make it the best game.

Here’s this week’s ACC Breakdown:

1. Florida State '

After the bizarre sexual assault story
surrounding freshman quarterback Ja-
meis Winston surfaced, some thought the
Florida State quarterback would struggle
against Syracuse. Winston went on to throw
for 277 yards and two touchdowns en route
to a 59-3,victory. '

, 2. Clemson

After suffering from embarrassment at
the hands of the Seminoles, Clemson seem-
ingly disappeared from national conscious-
ness.'The Tigers’ offense has continued to
roll in three games since the loss to Florida
State, averaging more than 51 points per
game, including 55 in the Tigers’ 55-31 vic-
tory against Georgia Tech.

3. Duke

Their schedulé is far from daunting, but
what the Blue Devils have accomplished
all year is impressive. With its 48-30 vic-
tory against then-No. 23 Miami, Duke is
the favorite to -win the Coastal Division.
Although they still haven’t entered the BCS
rankings, there’s something special about
the Blue Devils.

4. Georgia Tech A

With their loss to Clemson, the Yellow

1 Jackets also lost control of the Coastal

Division. Although they”didn’t know it in

North Carolina's win puts it ahead of Pitt in this week's rankings. Bobby Mizia [Visual Editor

their game Thursday, a win would have
guaranteed the Jackets the division crown.
Georgia Tech wraps up its season with two

- non-conference games and now must hope

for Duke to lose one of its remaining games.
5..North1Carolina ‘

After leading 27-3 against Pitt at the end
of the ﬁrst half last week, the Tar Heels
reverted to being the team that started
the year 1-5 and surrendered their lead.
But thanks to its special teams’ play —
especially punt returner Ryan Switzer -
North Carolina escaped Pittsburgh with
a win. Now the winner of four games in
a row, North‘ Carolina will likely become
bowl-eligible this weekend against Old
Dominion. ‘

6. Miami

Not many teams will win allowing 40-
plus points. That’s the problem Miami
faces.’ The Hurricanes started the season
7-0 and allowed a maximum of 30 points
in a game. But in the past three games,
Miami has allowed more than 40 points
each game, though it should easily right the
ship_ this weekend against hapless Virginia.

7. Virginia Tech

Virginia Tech lost 27-24 in overtime Sat-
urday to a struggling Maryland team and
has now lost three of its past four games.
The Hokies are still in the running for the

Coastal Division with a Duke loss.

8. Boston College _

Taking care of North Carolina State,
38-21, the Eagles became bowl-eligible in
head coach Steve Addazio’s ﬁrst season in
Chestnut Hill. Boston College kept the ball
on the ground and rushed for 420 yards
and all four of its touchdowns.

9. Pitt

After looking dominant early in the
game Saturday against the Tar Heels, the
Panthers began their downward spiral fol-

. lowing a Tom Savage fumble in the ﬁrst

quarter. Then the luck returned to Pitt
with two fumbles by North Carolina, and
the Panthers tied the score in the fourth

V quarter. But just as quickly as luck found

Pitt, it left. North Carolina’s Ryan Switzer
took his second punt to the end zone and
ruined the Panthers’ comeback.

10. Maryland

It took the Terrapins one month and
four days to go from ﬁve wins to six and be-
come bowl-eligible. With the losing streak
over, Maryland has winnable games against
Boston College and North Carolina State to
round out the season.

11. Syracuse

Syracuse did its part in helping the ACC
by becoming the victim of Florida State’s
latest walloping. The 56-point loss doesn’t
tell us much about the Orange other than
that they are vastly inferior to the Semi-
noles. Don’t feel badly, Syracuse fans: so
is every other team in the ACC.

12. Wake Forest

With two weeks to prepare, the Demon

Deacons will be the next to take on the.

ACC’s second—hottest team, Duke. Wake
Forest needs to win out to earn a bowl-
game bid.

13. North Carolina State

After establishing itself as the worst
North Carolina team in the ACC, NC State
will likely prove this weekend that it’s also
worse than East Carolina, which, at 8-2,
might actually be the second-best team
in the state.

14. Virginia

The Cavaliers had last weekend off and
now play Miami and Virginia Tech to round
out the season. Although the Hurricanes
and Hokies are in slumps,_don’t expect
Virginia to knock either of them off. I

After dropping two of their ﬁrst three
games, the Wolverines return to the
Chrysler Center to face Pitt after con-
secutive road wins against Detroit and
Western Michigan.

The Wolverines have won at least 20
games in three of the past four seasons
and look to use the Pitt game as a spring-
board into the Barclays Invitational in
Brooklyn, N.Y., a non-conference tourna-

Following the Michigan game, the Pan-
