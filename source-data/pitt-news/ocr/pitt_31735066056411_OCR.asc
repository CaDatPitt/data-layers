Mandatory organ donation considered

By Pete Kapustynski
Asst. News Editor

Residents of Pennsylvania will become
organ donors unless they specifically state
otherwise, if a new law is approved.

“The lideal is simply this: we presume that
people are donors unless they decide not to
be, unless they say they don’t want to be,”
Senator Michael M. Dawida (D-Allegheny)
announced Tuesday.

The “presumed consent” law will include
ways to say no to organ donation such as
having a signed non—donor card, placing a
sticker on the back of a driver’s license or
orally informing your physician.

Another option is “having a spouse, son,
daughter, parent, brother, sister, guardian
lsay otherwise]. All those different people
who are close to you can opt you out,”
Dawida said. “We err on the side of liberal-
ization of not donating. You might want to
donate, but if your wife says no or your
husband says no  then it won't happen.”

Donors will also be able to fill out a card
that will specify which organs they want to
donate if they do not want to donate them
all.

“It will be years before this program is in

place,” University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center’s chief of transplantation, John J.
Fung, said.

Fung said even if the bill is rejected, the
debate will be beneficial.

“If for some reason there was a big uproar
against it, and people said ‘no, we don’t
want this,‘ at least people will think about
it,” Fung said.

I)awida said he learned of the presumed
consent laws during a trip to Europe.
Presumed consent laws of this type exist in
other countries including Austria, Belgium,
France, ‘Greece, Israel, Spain and
Switzerland.

Dawida said he was told that although
they have a better supply of organs in
European countries because of it, they do
not have advanced transplant centers like
those in America.

“We have a verylwonderful program in
Pittsburgh and throughout the country
which is saving people's lives. However,
nationally, more than 29,000 individuals are
awaiting transplantation, and one will die
every four hours without receiving one,"
Dawida said.

“Now something like that is hard for me

Towers residents learrz
about AIDS ﬁrstboma’

By Carol Whaley
For The Pitt News

Residents in Tower C glimpsed the world of an HIV—positive man
last night.

Nearly 30 students crammed into the 15th ﬂoor lounge to hear
the experiences of Doug Miklos, a dancer with the HIV virus.

Miklos discovered he had the virus four years ago, only months
after arriving in Pittsburgh from California. He participated in the
Pitt Men’s Study and was given an AIDS test as part of the pro-
gram.

“The doctor walked in and said, I have bad news. You have
HIV,” explained Miklos. “I went into a denial stage for a long time."

Miklos said he realized that talking about his disease rather than
denying it was better therapy.

“A lot of people who are HIV ‘positive are afraid to come onto
campuses to speak,” he said. “To come out and talk about it is bet-
ter for me.”

There was no sign of tension or uneasiness on the part of the 33-
year-old dancer from the Physical Theater Project as he fielded
questions from the students.

Unlike many people with HIV the reactions of people around
Miklos have generally been supportive. “I haven't had any
extremely negative reactions to my face, but I do have people I
don’t see anymore,” he said.

For Miklos, the worst reactions are those of people who become

josh Knauer, spokesperson
for Pittsburgh Friends of Mt.
Graham, and Matt Peters, presi-
dent of Pitt’s Student
Environmental Action Coalition
(SEAC), have joined their coun-
terparts from across the country
and are gathered in
Washington, I).C., today.

They are there to discuss the
Mt. Graham Telescope Project
that the University of Pittsburgh
is considering supporting. The
project is supported by the
University of Arizona, the
Vatican and the Max Planck
Institute all partners in the
project to construct a large tele-
scope complex on the summit
of Mt. Graham, Arizona.

The mountain is the site for
local Apache religious cere-
monies and is considered by
many environmentalists to be
ecologically unique. It is also
the habitat of the endangered
Mt. Graham red squirrel.

Once the University of
Arizona indicated that it intend-
ed to erect the telescope array
on Mt. Graham, opposition rose
to meet it. The San Carlos
Apache Tribal Council, the
Apache Survival Coalition and
local environmentalists were
the first to protest.

In District of Columbia yester-
day, representatives of the

nation’s prominent “Big Ten” 0

environmental groups -— the

to Washington, D.C.

Audubon Society, Greenpeace,

the National Wildlife
Association and others — met
with members of regional

groups (among them SEAC and
Pittsburgh Friends of Mt.
Graham).

The groups intend to develop
a strategy for bringing the con-
troversial Mt. Graham Project to
national attention and eventual-
ly to extinction.

“Our goals are to take the
next step, to make lMt. Graham]
a national issue and to find
ways to enforce the few laws
that exist to protect the environ-
ment and Native Americans that
have been continually ignored,"
Peters said.

According to Knauer, mem-
bers of the newly-formed
National Friends of Mt. Graham
Coalition were successful yes-
terday in designing their strate-
gy and establishing many con-
tacts between other environ-
mental groups.

He said Pittsburgh environ-
mental groups will now work
as members of a national coali-
tion in order to end the moun-
tain telescope project.

“In the next couple of
months, some very exciting
things will be happening con-
cerning Mt. Graham,” Knauer
said.

Knauer described the opposi-
tion to the development of the
Arizona mountain as a grass-
roots joint effort. The joint effort

Growing up in Arkansas as an African
American, Edris Cooper remembers people
telling her she could never be an actress.
“You can’t be no actress, you’re a black girl.
Learn how to type or make a bed.”

Last night in the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room, Cooper proved she could
do what she always wanted to do — act.

Cooper, along with two other members of
the San Francisco-based acting group
Cultural Odyssey, acted out the struggles of
the African-American people in a white-
dominated society to a web of music from

rap to jazz.

In one scene, under a funky hip-hop beat,
Billy Mars, a confused black youth played
by Will Wylie, struggled with the temptation
of crack from a drug dealer, who claimed
he had the “pure, cure  for all your pain.”

“Your life is tragic. All you need is a little
magic,” sang the coke dealer, played by
Idris Ackamoor, as he circled the young,
impressionable man.

The scene changed as the music changed

_ from a hard hip-hop to a reggae beat. This

scene, still dealing with the plight of African

Americans, focused on the problems of pre-

dominantly African-American communities.

overly caring. “They think you
need everything done for you,
and sometimes I end uphaving
to support them," the wiry
dancer said.

Miklos, who receives treat-
ment at the Pittsburgh AIDS
Center, is beginning to see the
signs of AIDS.

He has lost a considerable
amount of weight during the
past year and has watched his
T-cell count slip to 200, well out
of the normal range of 1,200.

“It really has changed every-
thing in my life,” he said. “It has
made me appreciate what I
have.”

What Miklos had in the past
was a mixture of sex and drugs
during his college years. “I real-
ly didn’t have any respect for
life at all,” he said. That mixture
leaves Miklos wondering
whether he contracted HIV
through drug use or a lover.

“The whole deal about safe
sex needs to be priority,” he
said. “It’s all our responsibility
to protect ourselves.”

Miklos said that education
should start at a young age. “I’m
pretty liberal. I’m gay. I’m a
dancer. I have HIV,” he said
with a laugh. “Start right away
saying there are a million kinds
of people in the world -
accept them all.”

He stressed that many people
still believe AIDS is a gay.dis-
ease, but figures prove other-
wise. The fastest growing num-
ber of cases is among hetero-
sexual women. “It’s surprising
to me that so many people
don’t know. much about AIDS,”
he said. “For me, having HIV, it
seems it’s right there in the
newspapers and on television
every day.”

AIDS is not going away even
if people try to ignore it. In
Allegheny County alone there
are 779 reported cases of HIV.
That number is expected to
reach between 77,900 to
779,000 in 10 years. ‘

' Miklos’s aim was not to
explain how to avoid exposing
yourself to HIV but to explain
what life is like with the virus.

“It’s important for people to
put a face on statistics,” he said.
“People need to have a better
understanding of what it’s like
to live with HIV.”

shook his head in disbelief.
The anger, Wylie said, aris-
es from frustration from a
sense of hopelessness.

“They have nothing to

Lifesaving law

Pennsylvania, with all of its archaic laws, is for once at the
forefront of some truly groundbreaking legislation. Following the
lead of several European countries, the new law, if approved,
will require all residents of Pennsylvania to become organ donors
unless they specifically state otherwise.

The idea is a simple one. It is aimed at the people who are
apathetic toward organ donation. “We presume that people are
donors unless they say they don’t want to be,” said Senator
Michael Dawida of Allegheny County. The law will be liberally
applied and is not a conspiracy to gather up everyone’s organs
upon their deaths. ’

The law will include ways to “just say no” to organ donation.
There will be such things as a non-donor card, a non-donor
sticker on the back of a drivef’s license or familial consent to
prohibit your organs from being donated. Furthermore, a donor
will be able to specify which organs can or cannot be donated.

The law is a necessary-one and does nothing more than
change the nature of the question. This can make a huge differ-
ence in determining the number of organs available for life sav-
ing transplants. The need for organ (l()nati()ns is large. Nationally,
more than 29,()()() people are awaiting transplants. Almost daily a
person can pick up any national paper arid read of a child in dire
need of a liver or kidney transplant. And while 75 to 80 percent
of Americans support organ donation only 15 percent ever wind
up doing it.

However, not only will it save human lives directly, but it will
also increase the amount of resources available for progressive
research.

And who knows it could even save the life of a baboon or two.

Evaluations essential

For university instructors, the goal of tenure is a destination
most wish to reach. After years of schooling and hard work,
tenure represents the fruits of one’s difficult struggles. Among
the Ultimate in compliments, it brings lifetime employment,
prestige, influence and marketability to a professor.

At most colleges and universities aroundthe country tenure
is based strongly on the research and publication aspects of
academia. In Pitt’s political science department and many
other colleges, to be tenured, a professor must first solicit let-
ters from outside’ his or her department Then an outside
department meets and recommends him or her to the dean.
The dean then recommends the professor to the provost or
president and a decision is made.

The only thing missing in this scenario is student input.
When it comes to determining the success of a teacher, who
better to decide this than his or her students? While tenure
may primarily be researched based, it is not to say that stu-
dents should ignore the role they play. A professor from the
history department drew a comparison to voting and told us
that students have an obligation to take these evaluations seri-
ously.

Contrary to popular belief, evaluations are not ignored in
the tenure process. Both professors and deans take these
assessments into consideration when determining whether or
not a professor should be granted tenure. The problem is that
students don’t take them seriously enough and thus, make it
difficult to evaluate the professor objectively. If, however, a
concern arises time and time again, or the comments are very
consistent, further investigation will be taken.

Students are obligated to take these evaluations seriously. It
serves as a che.ck on professors and grants students the. voice
they value so much.

Living With the politically correct

Living alone tends to have its
drawbacks, and there are times
when I find myself wishing I
had some kind of companion
to discuss life’s daily events.
You know, the little things that
nobody else cares about except
your grandmother. After weeks
of addressing the problem, I
finally decided to get myself a
fish.

Her name was Fred, and she
was a guppy. (And a fine
guppy I must say.) I was excit-
ed about my new friend, for I
now had a conversational part-
ner. I was so excited, in fact,
that I called everyone I knew
to tell them the good news.

“I got a pet,” I would say.
“Her name is Fred, and she’s a
fine guppy.”

I was in the middle of
telling my friend about
Fred when there was a
knock at the door. As I
opened it, I saw two men
dressed in grey pinstriped
suits and a plastic see-
through briefcase.

“Mr. Dave,” they said,
“we are from the National
Board For The Unbiased
Representation Of
Creatures Coexisting On
Planet Earth.” (NBFTUROC-
COPE for short.)

“We‘ received reports that
you have been referring to
your new friend as a pet. This
is in violation of Act 4, Section
8. All animals are to be called
animal companions, as the
word pet has negative connota-
tions.

I was mortified by my
actions. How could I have
been so thoughtless?

“If you do this again you will
spend a minimum of 10. days in
jail and be forced to pay a fine

79

of 530."

‘‘I’m sorry officers," I said,
and I apologized to Fred.

After the officers exited, I
thought my problems were
over. I was wrong. Fred gave
birth to 20-something baby
Freds. Ié7vasn’t there for the
event, and Fred ate her babies.
(Guppies do this sometimes.) I
was shocked. If she only would
have only told me, I would
have made sure I was home
with her.

When I got home, I was
greeted by a band of animal
rights protesters who were

Dave
Buder

something like this: While
innocently watching a Daffy
Duck cartoon, Mrs.
Shrivelprunes’ kindergarten
class was cited and fined for
slander.

A task force has been formed
to find out whether or not the
students came to the conclu-
sion that all ducks were, in fact,
looney.

Inspector Book’m said, “I am
determined to get to the bot-
tom of this racist conspiracy.”
He. . alleges that
Shrivelprtrnes owns an Elmer
Fudd._. wristband and that her
students have been encouraged
to avoid all ducks by telling
them they would inherit a psy-
chological disorder if they were
to eat or come in contact with

any type of bird.

 

chanting, “You murderer, your
negligence killed the innocent.”

I had to give Fred away to a
better home. I tried to give her
a good life, but I guess I
couldn’t provide her with all
the things she needed.

My situation, as strange as it
may be, is hardly an isolated
one. A recent headline read:
“Kindergarten students sus-
pended for racist remarks
against ducks.” The story read

An informed source,
who preferred to remained
unnamed, commented,
“The class ate nothing but
peanut butter and white
bread for a week. One stu-
dent took it as far as giving
up milk due to the miscon-

ception that it came from a

duck.”

In a related story, a
certain parent/activist was
reported to have turned in
her own child. After playing
with the new pregnant

Barbie doll, young Miss X
began to play with the regular
one. Ken jumped to the conclu-
sion that she had an abortion
and staged a protest. (Was it
Ken’s baby? It could have been
G.I. Joe's. Perhaps they should
get a blood test.)

These are serious issues that
need to be addressed.

Slammed

BC pounds Pantloersforfirst bome loss of season,

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

The Fnergizer bunny made a
partisan appearance. last night in
the form of Boston College. The
Eagles went on a 41-14 run in a
little over 18 minutes. en route
to a 79-56 blasting of the Pitt
Panthers in a game and an
Eagle spurt that just kept going
and going.

In an ugly contest that had
Panthers faithfuls asking, “\X/hen
do you stop counting this run,“

Pitt came
out as flat as
water on a
plate, shoot-
ing a miser-
able 36 per-

cent from
the floor,
and was

boarded by the Big Fzistls worst
rebounding squad by 45-51.
The loss was the Panthers‘ most
lopsided at the Field House
since the '84-'85 season when
St. Johns smacked the Panthers
87-56 Linder Roy Chipm;1n‘s
helm.

Boston College (14-7, 8-5)
used no Vaseline in its waxing
of the Panthers (15-6. 7-6).
stymieing Pitt with an aggressive
man-to—man and zone combina-
tion that eliminated Pitt‘s.pver-
whelming inside advarlfage,
while the BC guards continually
penetrate.d the Panthers‘ slack-
ing defense and controlled the
tempo throughout.

The Eagles, who surrendered
their last lead with six—and-a-half
mimites to go in the first half at
24-22, went on a 15-2 scamper
to the end the half. highlighted
by a Malcolm Huckaby three-
pointer at the buzzer.

The second frame proved to
be worse for the Panthers, who
kept missing and missing, while
the Fagles displayed patience
offensively, spreading the floor
with their three—guard rotation.
The results were easy inside
baskets for BC and a mounting
fi'usti'ation on the Pitt sideline.

The BC hero statistically was
junior center Billy Curley, who
tallied 16 points and snatched
14 rebounds, as he denied the
Panthers second-shot opportuni-
ties that they desperately need-
ed. Nothing was falling from
outside for Pitt, who, in dire
need for points and a momen-
tum shift, fired up 17 three-
point attempts in the second
half, connecting on only three.

Panther head coach Paul
Evans, juggling his lineup like a
jester in a royal court, tried a
handful of player combinations
that never produced points or
emotion as he witnessed his
team finish without a double
digit scorer or rebounder. Jerry
McCullough and Antoine Jones
led the dismal Panthers with
eight points each, while super-
sub Brian Brush grabbed six
boards.

BC mentor Jim O‘Brien, who
was a woeful 3-11 lifetime
against Pitt, credited his team’s
defensive effort.

“We played real well defen-
sively, and we didn’t have to
play I) for very long. They
couldn’t guard us with the three
guards," O’Brien said, referring
to juniors Howard F.isley (14
points and six assists), Huckaby
(15 points, 5 rebounds) and
Gerrod Abram, who chipped in
nine points off the bench.

players and coaches.

I went to a Pitt blowout and a hockey game
broke out —- between the coaches.

For those loyal-beyond-be.lief Pitt fans who
remained at chilly Fitzgerald Field House for the
final moments of the Panthers‘ 79-56
blowout loss to Boston College, there
was an unscheduled postgame under-
card to the scheduled 4() minutes of
Big East basketball action -—- a shove-
and-shout scrum between opposing

With both benches converging on
the floor following the final horn, several
Panthers and Golden Eagles went toe-to—toe and
obscenity—to-obscenity in defense of, believe it
or not, their respective head coaches — each of
whom had choice words for the other in the
midst of the fracas, as well as in the postgame
press conference. The argument’) Whether or not
Boston College was running up the score late in

Pitt game features post-game
shoving and shouting match

the second half when it kept its starters in. the
game and ran a delayed four-corners offense.
First to speak was Boston College head coach
Jim O’Brien, who was pursued and reprimanded
by Pitt head coach Paul Evans after the final
whistle.
“He made a comment about us running four-
corners when we’re up by 20 points,”
O’Brien said. “[He wasl upset with that.
I was a little bit surprised at it because
we’re struggling like crazy and fighting
to get into the toumament.

“We go with the spread
loffensel up 2() points with eight min-
utes to go. To me, that’s pretty good

strategy because we’re controlling the game and
we’re spreading the floor. If he wanted us to just
run up and down the floor and start shooting
quick three’s like they were doing, I don’t think
that that’s the way for us to play.”

Not so, according to Evans, who had quite a
different take on O’Brien’s actions in the second

Forward Chris Gant and the rest of the Panthers got pounded by Boston College last night.

Curley and Eagles
dominate the glass

ByBrian Gallagher

Sports Assistant

In a battle of surprise. teams, it was appropriate that something
slightly surprising took place at the battle of Big East upstarts at the
Field House last night.

Boston College -— the league’s second worst rebounding team ——
choked off Pitt’s vaunted inside attack all night with a dose of surprise
muscle and hustle, winning the battle of the boards, 45-31, en route to
a stunning 79-56 win.

The Panthers, entering the game ranked third in the conference
rebounding standings, were a step behind from the opening tap to the
final whistle —— all but standing in awe at the hustling BC board men.

Leading the “awe-filled” charge in the paint for BC was Bill Curley,
who grabbed a game—high 14 rebounds to go along with his garne-
high 16 points. In redeeming himself for his less—than-stellar effort in
the first Pitt-BC matchup, Curley dominated the Pitt tandem of Eric
Mobley and Chris McNeal, outscoring (16-14) and outrebounding (14-
8) the duo all by his lonesome to send the Panthers packing.

“Curley did a great job of controlling the defensive boards,” Boston
College Coach Jim O’Brien said after the game. “We got good help on
McNeal and Mobley, and for the most part did a good job on the
boards. _

THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, February 17, 1993

 

I was just wondering if anyone
else out there is sick of reading
Rob Pugliese’s insistent whining?
Iknow I am!

First of all, the Philadelphia
Eagles are the overrated team,
not Dallas! This is not easy for
me to write either, considering I
hate the Cowboys. I will give
credit where it is due, though,
and Dallas deserves credit. As for
all those “bandwagon” Cowboys
fans you ripped upon late last
year, Mr. Pugliese, they are hav-
ing a great time with their Super
Bowl champions — not another
disappointment. Philly is sup-
posed to be such an awesome
team, according to Rob, but
when was the last time they
reached the NFC Championship
game, much less the Super Bowl?

Second of all, granted, Eric

:0 vfbo y ‘s ruie, Barkley

Lindros (rookie center for the
Philadelphia Flyers) is only 19,
but he is a pro athlete and is get-
ting paid millions of dollars to do
what he does. He is in the pub-
lic’s eye and should be a little
more responsible. No one has
ever heard of Mario Lemieux or
Wayne Gretzky doing things to
give them a negative relationship
with the public, and they both
came up as teenagers, also.
Maybe Mr. Lindros should just
grow up, shut up and play hock-
ey. For what he is getting paid,
which is ridiculous in itself for he
hasn’t done anything yet, Eric
Lindros should have a lot more
points than he has. I know, I
know, he’s missed six weeks or
whatever, but Mario has missed
quite a few weeks himself and is
still second in scoring.

doesn 1, and]:

The next subject is the com-
ment that Charles Barkley is the
best player in the NBA. Come on!
Here’s a quarter, buy a clue, Mr.
Pugliese! How many consecutive
scoring titles has Barkley won?
How many MVP seasons has he
had? How many championships
has he led his team to?  Now
let’s check out Michael Jor_dan’s
résumé, shall we? Hmmm, I see:

1) 9 consecutive scoring titles.

2) three MVP seasons

3) two times he led the Bulls to
the summit of the NBA

4) two MVPs of the champi-
onship series.

5) one defensive title.

6) Was named Rookie of the
Year. A

 Don’t get me wrong, Charles
Barkley is a great player, but
achievements speak louder than

half of the BC blowout.

“I said Ito Coach O‘Brien that} I
don’t think he should be in a four-
comer offense with a 25-point
lead with your starters in," Evans
said. "I can’t repeat his response
[to me].

“I’ve never‘ seen Louie
Camessecca or john Thompson or
anybody like that do that lwirh
such a big lead]. You just don’t do
that.”

While Evans was miffed over
O‘Brien‘s insistence in keeping the
BC starters on the floor, O’Brien
was anything but apologetic about
the actions of himself or his team.

“The thing that’s interesting to
me is  we’re good ol’ Boston
College when we’re in last place
and everybody’s kicking our asses
and there’s no problem,” O'Brien
said of his second—place Golden
Eagles. “But as soon as we get an
opportunity to become a little bit
better, nobody likes it when we
win.

“We’ve gotten ow‘ asses kicked
in this league for years. And I’ll be
the last person on earth -- espe-
cially in this damn league —— to
apologize for winning some game.
He should know better. If he’s
upset with that, that’s the way it
goes.”

Guard Jerry McCullough is one
Panther who won’t soon forget
the lack of mercy displayed by die
Golden Eagles.

“Its a rivalry now,” McCullough
said. “They started it. I guess the
coach from BC wanted a taste of
what its like to blow people out.
Whenever we meet Iagainl, there’s
going to be a lot of tension.”

player in the NBA.

Finally, we get to the subject of
(Eagles quarterback) Randall
Cunningham. He is not a good
quarterback, period! He is merely
a running back who got stuck
playing the wrong position.
Running backs who play quarter-
back never win championships.

Hoops

Continued from page 8
fronted Panther big men Eric
Mobley and Chris McNeal by
denying entry passes and tore-
ing the Panther wing men into
ill—advised shots.

“I don’t have a whole lot to
we stunk and we didn’t
e a d game from any-
body at " ier end of the court,"
Evans said. “F.verything fell
apart. There is only so many
w’ 3 I can say that.”
- circumstances regarding
last night’s matchup indicated a
desperate, must win for both
teams. liut the Panthers never
played with the intensity or
determination of a game that

had both NCAA Tournament
implications and, more immedi-
ately, third place in the big East
on the line. For Pitt fans and
players, it became another
February head shaker leaving
behind a stench that the
Oakland community has tearful—
ly come to recogni/.e over the
last few seasons.

For the Pzmthers, who rel-
ished returning to their visitor-
inconvenient home, the Field
House proved to be the scene
of a brutal crime. One that
reminded fans of past late-sea-
son collapses and impressive
victories that became nearly
meaningless.
