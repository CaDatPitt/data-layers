Downtown  
standoff  
ends

An “evil mood” allegedly prompted
22-year-old Klein Michael Thax-
ton of Pittsburgh’s Beechview
neighborhood to bicycle Down-
town early Friday morning with a
cell phone, charger, hammer and
kitchen knife.

Thaxto n, a military veteran with
a criminal record, allegedly took
Charlie Breitsman, CEO of CW Bre-
itsman Associates LLC, hostage on
the 16th ﬂoor of 3 Gateway Center
Downtown around 8:15 a.m. that
morning. Thaxton then allegedly
held the victim captive for more
than ﬁve and a half hours before
voluntarily surrendering to police
officers at about 2 p.m.

Shortly after Thaxton surren-
dered to authorities, police spokes-
woman Diane Richard said that
Breitsman remained unharmed. He
was reunited with his family before
being taken to police headquarters
for a debrieﬁng.

Richard called Thaxton “an ac-
tor” in the day’s events, but she also
noted that he was “a sick young
man” and that the police would en-
sure that his rights were respected.

While negotiations with the sus-
pect remained ongoing, Pittsburgh
police chief Nate Harper periodi-
cally updated the press outside
of the building where Thaxton

was allegedly holding. Breitsman ,

hostage. The situation resulted in
the evacuation the high-rise office
building and disruption of a busy
downtown thoroughfare.

Newspaper boxes open for all students

Megan Trimble
Stqff Writer

Locked drop boxes don’t prevent
students who aren’t paying forthe
USA Today and New York Times
newspapers on campus from get-
ting copies, and they never have.
Following complaints from con-
cerned students in the Collegiate
Readership Program’s pilot year,
Pitt’s Student Government Board
worked last semester to prevent
people who don’t pay the $80 un-
dergraduate Student Activities Fee
from taking the newspapers the
program provides for students. But
the drop boxes do not limit access
to the papers to Pitt undergradu-
ates — they open for any Pitt stu-
dent with an ID. Even so, SGB mem-

bers maintain that the boxes serve
a purpose and that the program is
a valuable asset to undergraduates.

The Collegiate Readership Pro-
gram, which distributes 300 copies
of The New York Times and USA
Today to students on campus every
weekday, cost $30,500 in 2012 and
is funded by the Student Activi-
ties Fund, the sum of the Student
Activities Fees paid by all under-
graduate, non-College of General
Studies students. Last year, after
several months of the program’s
implementation, discontent over
ineffective dispersal procedures
prompted SGB to re—evaluate the
program’s worth. In January, the
Board settled on the installation
of swipe—access boxes_ to ﬁx the
problem of non—payers receiving

papers, allowing the readership
program to continue.

But Pitt’s director of Computing
Services and Systems Development
says the locked drop boxes never
would have stopped CGS and grad-
uate students from taking papers.

CSSD directorjinx Walton said
inan email that lastjanuary CSSD
met with SGB Presidentjames Lan-
dreneau and Kenyon Bonner, Pitt’s
associate director of student life, to
discuss the drop boxes with USA

’ Today and the vendor who pro-

vided the swipe-access recepticals.
The boxes were provided at no
cost to the Student Government
Board by representatives of The
New York Times and USA Today.

Two-day
vigil honors
POW, MIA

Dressed in all white and seated
in the front row, Frances Colletto.
attended her 30th vigil honoring
prisoner of war and missing—in-
action soldiers.

At 98, Colletto still feels it
important for her to‘ attend the
ceremonies because she lost her
son, Albert V. Colletto Jr., during
the Vietnam War in 1969. She was
the vigil’s oldest attendee and
a favorite among the veterans,
each of whom would stop to talk
and thank her for coming.

“I feel obligated to all these
boys who served with my son be-
fore he was killed,” Colletto said.

Vietnam Veterans Inc. held
its 30th annual Prisoners of War/
Missing in Action vigil at Soldiers
& Sailors from noon Saturday
until 2 p.m. Sunday. The event
included an opening ceremony
on Saturday afternoon, a candle-
light vigil Saturday night and a
closing ceremony Sunday after-
noon. In addition to honoring
past POWs, those at the vigil also
took time to reflect on current
issues facing veterans.

Colletto’s daughter, Carolyne
Stewart, accompanies her moth-
er every year.

“It’s beautiful,” Stewart said
of the vigil. “It’s so good to know
that they’re not forgotten.”

Vice President of Vietnam
Veterans Inc. Bob Burke said the
annual vigil is important to him
because it shows him how much
people care about America’s lost
soldiers.

POW/ MIA  

Vietnam Veterans Inc. Presi-
dent Greg Hogan elaborated.

“We hold the POW/MIA vigil
to raise awareness for those who
never came back from war,” he
said.

Hogan manned a table at
Soldiers 8: Sailors that sold mer-
chandise to raise money for the
organization. The non-profit
group raises money through-
out the year to help homeless
veterans and patients at the VA
hospital.

Hogan has been with the
group since the beginning. Viet-
nam Veterans Inc. formed in 1981
when a group of veterans who
met to talk to each other and
share stories collaborated to
create an official organization.

The group has held the vigil
every year since its formation
as a way of commemorating all
prisoners of war and soldiers
missing in action. This year about
450 people attended the two-day
event. ‘

“Our vigil for the POWs and
the MIAs is not just for two days
every September,” T._]. McGarvey,
a Vietnam War veteran said. “It
is constant.”

September 24, 20i 2 i The Pitt News l vwwv.i:>ittnevvs.cem

McGarvey, a Pitt alumnus,
presented the closing remarks
at the ceremony Sunday. He gave
special thanks to ROTC members
from Pitt and Duquesne Univer-
sity who helped to hold the flag
at Soldiers 8: Sailors throughout

the ceremony. McGarvey also '

recognized Goldstar Mothers
and Wives — mothers and wives

' who have lost their husbands and

sons in service.

The closing ceremony fea-
tured a musical performance
by Emma Lee Hartle. She sang
“The Wall,” a song she wrote as a
reflection after visiting the Viet-
nam War Memorial in Washing-
ton, D.C. . ’

“It’s about those who are
missing, those who have passed
before and our children to whom
we need to tell this story,” Hartle
said before she began to sing.

Hartle attended the vigil to
honor the victims ofthe Vietnam
War. She said a lot of the soldiers
never had a choice whether or
not to ﬁght and since the war,
many have not received recogni-
tion. Hartle noted that a lot of
Vietnam War veterans are home-
less today.

“These are my people,” Hartle
said of the Vietnam War veterans.
“I say that because this conflict

READERSHIP

Walton said that the vendor for the drop
boxes does not provide the capability of
connecting them to a network nor does he
have the ability to store a list of approved us-
ers, meaning the boxes cannot differentiate

between undergraduate, graduate and CGS A

student ID cards.

The boxes do, however, limit the access of
faculty and staff members by differentiating
between the 2P numbers on student ID cards
and those on faculty and staff cards.

Walton said that to truly differentiate be-
tween student types, the vendor of the locked
drop boxes would have to implement an intel-
ligent card scanner with network capability
or the 2P numbers on ID cards would have to
be changed to differentiate between student
type — meaning the University would have
to reissue cards to all students.

“The capabilities of the locked drop boxes
and the ID card were known by SGB and
others involved at the time the decision was
made to proceed,” Walton said. “LastJanuary,
the vendor indicated that they had no plans
to modify their system and the option of re-
issuing -ID cards was deemed as unfeasible.”

SGB Board member Julie Hallinan said

that while the Board knew the boxes would

not fully differentiate between the students
accessing their contents, they still perform
their intended function by preventing just
anyone from taking the papers.

“We wanted to make sure that students
paying into the program through the Student
Activities Fund were the ones beneﬁtting,”
she said. “In the past we have all seen faculty
and staff taking papers that were intended
for students, and during Pathﬁnder tours
through Towers, parents were just grabbing
copies.” I I

Landreneau said that the locked drop

boxes’ inability to block certain groups of _

students-from accessing the papers was a
disappointment.

“It was deﬁnitely discouraging to me
because we wanted to make sure that the
students paying for the papers were the only
ones accessing them,” Landreneau said. “But
I presented the info [that graduate students
and CGS students would have access to the
boxes] to the Board before voting on the
contract, and they still approved.”

Landreneau said that the locked drop
boxes'still serve an importantpurpose on
campus.

“The pickup rate of the papers in 2011 was
close to 100 percent. However, even though
the numbers this semester have dropped,
the roughly $30,000 that we f'und.for the
program is the peak of how much we would
spend if they were picked up every day. We
don’t pay for papers that aren’t picked up, so
the numbers are down because we are cutting
down on paper fraud,” he said.

Landreneau said the Board is working to
make the Readership Program more inclusive
so that graduate, CGS and nontraditional
students not_only have access to the papers,
but also help fund the program.

“The problem, though, is what is the in-

centive for these other groups to pay into

the program if they are already getting the

papers for free?” Landreneau said. -
Graduate student Rachael Greenwalt said

that she has never been denied access to the 

papers and picks copies up regularly. She said
she would be disappointed if she lost access.

“It would suck. Honestly, I think that grad ’

students use these papers more than the
undergrads do,” she said.

Hallinan said she believes that gradu-
ate and undergraduate students access the
papers equally and that she is working with
Landreneau to ﬁnd alternative ﬁmding for
the program to alleviate some of the ﬁnancial

burden the program places on the Student V

Activities Fund. 3
“James and I have been working with the

Graduate Program Student Government and '

the College of General Studies to see if they
would buy into the program as well,” Hal-
linan said. “Right now we are just trying to
work on a fair price and taking into consid-
eration the fact that the other groups have
smaller funds. This may also prompt us to
move around the boxes a bit and put them
in places where grad students would have
greater access to them, such as the Cathedral
or maybe Scaife Hall. ,

Hallinan noted that the Collegiate Read-
ership Program offers a variety of other
beneﬁts to students at the University, in ad-
dition to copies of the newspapers. These

I include the opportunity to host different

panel discussions and for New York Times

A reporter John Broder to speak on campus

in November.

“I deﬁnitely see value in the program be-
cause having the papers themselves are so
valuable, but also everythihg else we can do
with it is so great,” she said. .

Landreneau said that while student re-

sponse ultimately decides the fate of the

readership program, he hopes that incom-
ing Boards will be supportive. ' '

“Certainly it is not a cheap program, but
I hope that it gets renewed because it’s still
at its birth, and we are still working to pro-
mote it.”

Before the current Board members ﬁnish
their terms in January, they plan to decide

‘whether or not to renew the Collegiate Read-

ership Program for another year.

Landreneau said the cost of the program
will be more substantial if it is renewed for
the future, as the $30,500 funding covered
the costs from March through December,
which were affected by the program’s brief
hiatus last winter.

Landreneau said that one reason the pro-
gram was temporarily halted last winter was
because. the Board had to make quick. deci-
sions. He said he hopes to create a better
transition period for future Boards.

“This year’s Board was thrown into mak-
ing the decision [to renew the program] im-
mediately,” he said. “The contract right now
is an annual renewal where each Board that
comes into place has to vote on renewing the
program, but the goal of my Board is to see if
we can extend it through April for the 2013

Board, to give them enough time to make a .

decision for themselves.” I

Religious organizations shouldn’t hide S

behind First Amendment to avoid  
unrelated responsibilities

Nick Stamatakis
Assistant Opz'm'ons Editor

And the Lord sayeth, “Thou
shalt not unionize.”

Apparently, Pittsburgh’s own
Duquesne University considers

- this to besome kind of eleventh
commandment.

Last week, the school, which

,maintains affiliation with the
Spiritans, a Catholic religious
order, continued its ﬁght with
unionizing adjunct professors.
The school alleges that its re-
ligious status exempts it from
oversight by the National Labor
Relations Board — the govern-
ment organization responsible
for maintaining labor rights —
and therefore doesn’t need to
honor the adjuncts’ recent vote
to unionize.

The administrationhas a
real interest, albeit a selﬁsh
one, in preventing adjuncts
from becoming unionized. The

part-time, non—tenure track fac- '

ulty are the mules of the higher
educational system, doing a lot
of work for very little income.
Desperately seeking to impress
potential employers offering
tenure track positions, adjuncts
typically accept low pay in hopes
of earning something better in
the future. Duquesne could lose
serious leverage if it were forced
to recognize the new union.

. But by citing religious exemp-
tion, the school is doing a dis-
service to other groups’ more
legitimate claims for exemption,
ultimately weakening religious
authority in the public sphere
and further damaging the repu-
tation of a community already

‘ tarnished by sex scandalsand al-
legations of backward thinking.
On matters purely regarding
religious doctrine, Duquesne’s
claim falls apart because the
Catholic Church is one of the
most pro-union organizations in
the world. Popes from Leo XIII
in 1_89.1 to Benedict XVI in 2009
have written papal encyclicals

in support of unions. Affiliated
groups like the Catholic Scholars
for Workerjustice have gone so

far as to declare union busting

a “mortal sin.”,
In other words, the school
has no doctrinal claim here.
The situation stands in stark
contrast to the more publicized

. clash between Catholic organi-

zations and government: the

fight over mandated contra-

ception coverage. Here, there
is slightly-more legitimate spiri-

All these
things
-contribute
to an
increasingly
common  
opinion:
"Organized
religion is
corrupt.

tual" reasoning. Catholic teach-
ing, however ignored or sneered
at, does preach a very restricted
place for birth control. Through
certain interpretations of the
First Amendment and the Re-
ligious Freedom Restoration
Act, protesting organizations
might hold legal justification in
appealing certain mandates in
the Obama administration’s Af-

fordable Care Act, ailthough legal

experts remain unsure.

But in this case, Duquesne is
not being forced to do something
a Catholic institution would find
morally reprehensible. Instead,
the school is simply using the
shield of religion to exempt it

from an unpleasantobligation —

— honoring a vote in favor of
unionization.

It certainly wouldn’t be the
first time a religious or reli-
giously sympathetic group tried
to place the Creed Card. The
Catholic Church in Italy is infa-
mous for its tax-exempt status,
even on its many blatantly com-
mercial activities. Religious and
nonreligious parents regularly
use faith exemptions to avoid
vaccinations for their children.
And most critically in America,
many churches are exempt from
spiritually irrelevant laws re-
lated to child care, land use and
financial disclosure.

All these things help contrib-
ute to an increasingly common
opinion, held especially by many
secular Americans: Organized
religion is corrupt. Beneﬁciaries
of old power structures, out of
a desire to maintain their posi-
tions within society, use God as
a reason to be less_than gracious
civil citizens. V -

Thus, more legitimate claims
become intermingled with the
simple avoidance of .respon-
sibility. By constantly crying
about religious freedom, many
religious groups have become
nothing more than shrill voices
singing with hollow-hearted ar-
guments.

So if Duquesne University is
truly concerned with exercising
religious freedom and the slow
erosion of faith in the United
States —— which it should be
—— then the university should
accept the unionization vote
and move forward, as would
any secular organization in the
United States.

Not only would it ultimately
improve worker relations, but
it would send a clear message
that at least one religiously af-
filiated organization will not
hide behind the Bible or Quran
to protect itself from regulations
unrelated to its moral or reli-
gious teachings. I

have many positives to take
away from its on-the-ﬁeld

Roots THAT

Sepich: Pitt dominates
lowly Gardner-Webb

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

-In a different college football

universe, Saturday’s Pitt game
could have been much different.

In that alternate world, Heinz
Field likely would have been
teeming with fans anticipating a
crucial conferencematchup be-

tween the Panthers and a group _

of talented Horned Frogs from
Texas Christian University.
Had TCU not backed out of its
agreement to join the Big East
last year, the No. 17 team in the

‘ nation would have provided a

formidable foe for Pitt on this
day.

Instead,’ Pitt (2-2, 0-1 Big
East) dominated mismatched
Gardner-Webb (0-4) in front of
a tame crowd of 36,452 as the
Panthers cruised to an easy 55-
10 victory. ' ~

But don’t blame Pitt or Gard-
ner-Webb for Saturday’s unexcit—
ing showdown between the Pan-

"-thers and the amusingly named

Runnin’ Bulldogs.

Blame the ever—changing
landscape of collegiate athlet-
ics, where money, wins and bowl
eligibility ‘matter more than the
spirit of competition.

If,’ at the end of the season,
today’s victory helps Pitt earn a
lucrative bowl bid, every penny
of the roughly $475,000 that
the University sent to Gardner-
Webb will have been worth it.

Such is the reality of college
football. ’

In the same season that
Oklahoma State and Florida
State both scheduled mediocre
Savannah State and humiliated
the Football Championship Sub-
division school 84-0 and 55-0,
respectively, this game actually
appeared to be an evenly con-
tested football game for almost
an entire quarter.

Then Ray Graham decided he
wasn’t allowing the Panthers to
let this game turn into a repeat
of their embarrassing upset
loss against Youngstown State

earlier this month. Following a
Gardner-Webb missed field goal,
the senior running back sprinted
78 yards on the next play to open
the scoring with authority.

“That was a big play,” first-
year Pitt head coach Paul Chryst
said after the game. “It seemed
like it gotus going a little bit, but
we can’t wait for something like
that —— we got to take it to them.”

After the teams traded ﬁeld
goals, Gardner-Webb fumbled a
kickoff, and the Panthers took
advantage of the mistake when
freshman running back Rushel
Shell pounded in his first career
touchdown to extend the lead
to 17-3.

From there, the contest re-
sembled the forced, scheduled-
last-minute football game that it
really was. 1

Both teams struggled with the
strong wind on special teams.
The ofﬁcials whistled numerous
plays dead because of confusion
and made several questionable
calls. And even the fans in at-
tendancevseemed restless with
the day’s tedious proceedings.

It wasn’t pretty, but the Pan-
thers found a way to steadily
bolster their advantage as the
game progressed.

The only unit that found any
sort of rhythm or consistency
was the Pitt offense.

Apart from a Graham fumble
just before halftime that allowed
Gardner-Webb to return 65
yards for its only touchdown of
the game, the Panthers’ offense
moved the ball with ease, ‘tally-
ing 623 total yards —- the most
Pitt has recorded since 1997.
And by the end of the game,
Pitt’s 55 points marked the most

the team has scored since 1999. '

Most of that yardage
stemmed from the arm of vastly
improved quarterback Tino Sun-
seri, who passed for 344 yards
and three touchdowns with no
interceptions. -

Sunseri has silenced many
of his critics in the past two

weeks, finding his groove in
Chryst’s balanced attack. And
in the third quarter on Saturday,
the redshirt senior passed leg-
endary Pitt running back Tony
Dorsett on the program’s all-
time offensive yards list.

“That’s pretty cool,” Sunseri
said of the achievement. “Mr.
Dorsett is one of the best play-
ers to ever play this game. I give
a lot of the credit to the [offen-
sive linemen] for working and

.to the receivers for running the
right routes.”

V Following up two disappoint-
ing defeats with two resound-
ing victories is an impressive
achievement for Sunseri and the
Panthers. _

But with this team appear-
ing to be ﬁnally reaching its full
potential, expectations among
Pitt fans will rise in the weeks
leading up to must-win confer-
ence matchups with Syracuse
and Louisville.

Because in reality, the Big
East is an extremely winnable

‘conference. And TCU’s absence A ‘ V ~ S ‘
definitely has something to do Redshirt junior safety Jason Hendricks (25) and redshirt freshman linebacker Nicholas Grigsby (3) helped the Panthers defense
with it. I hold the Runnin’ Bulldog-5 to just 10 points. Sheldon Satenstein [Senior Staff Photographer ~

(évack Rushel Shell pushed the lead to 17-3.
The Runnin’ Bulldogs simply couldn’t catch
a break. P '
On their following two possessions, punter

Bo Lindsey had back—to—back punts deep in his -

own territory travel a mere 17 and 20 yards,
giving Pitt great opportunities to score. On
(‘the latter of the two chances, Sunseri lofted a
pass to receiver Devin Street on the ﬁrst play

touchdown on the day.
The ﬁrst half concluded with Pitt in con-

According to Sunseri, despite the favor-

to make sure his players knew they still had

half of a football game
to play.

“We got kind of
chewed at halftime‘
by Coach Chryst, but
I think it was a good
thing,” Sunseri said.
“He wanted to -make
sure we came out and
handled our business,
and we did.”

Pitt ﬁnished with

“It felt good to i
go out there and
put up points.”

Ray Graham

Gardner-Webb’s difficult season continues,

the team having lost all
of its games by an av-
erage of 31.3 points. It
played FCS opponents
in its ﬁrst three contests.
For Pitt, Mike Shana-
han and Sunseri linked
up often, as Shanahan
ﬁnished with a’career—
high of 144 receiving
yards and two scores.
_ Shanahan credited
the early success of the
run game with allowing

did. He noted that it opened up space down
the ﬁeld. .

To Street, the collective ability and experi-
ence of the wide receiver corps comes with the
responsibility to provide the spark forthe rest
of the team as well as for themselves.

“We have to be the group out there that
turns it up, that sets the tone,” Street said.
“We go out there and feed off each other. If
one [receiver] makes a play, we know the next
guy can make a play too.” _ p

The team has a bye week next Saturday

p before travelling to Syracuse and resuming Big

East play the following Friday night.

“Every week is a new week,” Chryst said.
“There is no doubt that the players are gaining
some conﬁdence.” I '
