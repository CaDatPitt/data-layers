Heinz Chapel Choir director to retire after twenty—ﬁve years of service

Meagan Hart
Stczjf Writer

After giving 25 years of service to the
Heinz Chapel and Pitt, choir director
and music lecturerjohn Goldsmith, 68,
has decided to retire. . . '
"‘5I’m ready,” Goldsmith said. “I’m
proud of what I’ve done, but I’m ready to
travel around the world with my wife.”
Goldsmith has every reason to be

‘ proud. As the sole director of the choir,

he has prepared the singers, who are
undergraduate Pitt students, for'con-
cert season every December, organized
and administrated choir programs and
served as the adviser for music majors
at Pitt.)

In his 25 years, he has gone on nine
international tours in 26 different coun-
tries— his trip to the Balkan Peninsula
in southeast Europe this summer will
be his 10th and final.vPicture,s of Gold-
smith with the choir members in dif-

W ferent parts of the world” hang around

his_i:off'ice.
Goldsmith gives the credit for his

seuccejss to his more than 50 choir mem-

bers, of which only two are music ma-

piers-

“This means that the kids want to
be here and are doing what they love,”
Goldsmith said. “Singing in the choir
isn’t a requirement. It’s what they love
to do. That’s what makes this so great.”

Charlie Schade, a sophomore ma-_
joring in marketing and supply chain
management, said the choir endearingly
calls Goldsmith by his initials, ].G.

“Sometimes our memorization isn’t
up to par in the weeks before a concert,
and ].G'.’s genuine personality comes
out,” Schade -said. “During these times,
you realize just how much he cares about
the choir and the success of the choir.
That quietly motivates you.”

For Goldsmith, the singers’ perfor-
mances from memorization alone is one
of the choir’s’ trademarks.  T A g y

' “With a piano‘, yoiuijust have to press

the right keys and the sound is right.
The same thing with a trumpet. But with
memorizing songs, it’s all in here,” Gold-
smith said, pointing to his ears. “The
audience is very impressed when the
choir performs without sheetlmusic.”

The choir is also.one of the last uni-
versity choirs in the country to sing
purely a capella — without instruments
or other background music — and ac-
cording to Goldsmith, the choir sings a
wide variety of styles. .

According to Goldsmith, the group
has sung a cappella renditions of Beatles
songs, folk songs,jazz, madrigals, mo-
tets, love songs and sacred and secular
music from around the world.

Emily Collins, the choir’s president, .

has been a member of the choir for four
years and attributes her shift in person-
ality to her involvement.

“I joined my freshman year, when
I was a much shyer and much quieter
versionof the person I am today,” Col-
lins, a senior majoring in nutrition and

dietetics,said. “Being in choir deﬁnitely
brought me out of my shell.”

According to Collins, there is no cost
to join the choir. Women only have to
purchase the dresses used in perfor-
mances, and men must buy a tuxedo if
they do not already own one.

Goldsmith said the choir receives
donations from singers’ families, alumni
and allocations from the Student Gov-
ernment Board, which pays for music,
supplies, van rentals and other things.

Janet Sarbaugh, the senior program
director of the Arts and Culture Pro-
gram of the Heinz Endowments, said
the endowments contributed $30,000
to the choir within the past year to pay
for international tour scholarships for
the members.

“We are great supporters of the choir
program,” Sarbaugh said. “They go on
wonderful international tours, and it’s
an all—around great community.”

‘_ For Josephine, Olson, being; called

“bossy”‘is a badge of honor.
“If being bossy means being assertive,

knowing what you want and being able V
‘to telllpeople what you think should be
done, then being bossy shouldn’t be a I

bad thing,” said Olson, director of Pitt’s
International Business Center.

7 Beyoncé, Jane Lynch, Condoleezza
Rice, Diane von Furstenberg andjennifer

~ Garner would disagree.
  These celebrities and world leaders’
‘I aféjiromoting the “Ban Bossy” cam-

paign, started. by Sheryl Sandberg, chief
operating officer of Facebook, and Anna
Maria Chavez, chief executive officer of
the Girl Scouts of the USA.

Sandberg and Chavez wrote in the

Wall Street-Journal last month that they

started. the campaign to promotelleader-
ship among young girls and bring atten-

tion to the negative connotation of the

word ‘_‘bossy” when referring to female
leaders.‘ M . V

j Chavez‘ referenced the ‘Girl Scouts
,Résea_rch’ Institute study “Change it Up,”

which coiiipiiled information from a 2007 ’
online survey that asked questions about ‘

leadership among young people. The

institute distributed the online survey to '

more than 4,000 boys and girls between
8 and 17 years old.

According to the survey, 29 percent
of female respondents '—*—-versus 13 per-
cent of male respondents — considered
seeming bossy as a barrier to leader-
ship. Female respondents surpassed
male respondents in other categories
about leadership deterrents, including
the fear of making others mad and being
disliked or laughed at by others.

By banning the word bossy, Sandberg,
Chavez and partners, including Pantene
Pro-V, Teach for America and Always,
hope to reduce such statistics.

According to the campaign’s website,
the campaign has promoted a series of
press releases, ads and merchandise,’
including rnugs,iPhone cases and kids’
clothing, that discourage the use of the
word bossy, as well as suggestions for
teachers and parents on how to promote
leadership skills among young girls.

For some‘, vernacular could inﬂuence
attitudes, after all.

Scott Kiesling, a linguistics professor,
agreed that hearing the word “bossy”
could negatively affect young children.

“Even if it’s not usedzagainst you, it
would make you think about whether
or not you should be strong, assertive
and things like that,” Kiesling said. “Or
ifyou call someone else ‘bossy,’ it shows

Ban Bossy: Feminist initiative pushes for elimination of stigma

that you think about the world in a way
that girls aren’t supposed to be strong.”

Olson, who’s been working at Pitt for
more than 40 years, said she’s had a
share of moments when she felt singled
out as awoman. . t ., b

“When I came, _I was the only woman
in my department,” Olson,‘ also :a, busi-
ness professor, said. “I always_had peo-
ple asking me for a ‘woman’s opinion.’ I
was constantly teaching classes, entirely
of young _men. I once had a man apolo-
gize to me because he was ‘just not used
to working with women.”’ < v

The sentiment that men are not
used to working with women is well-
supported, for women comprise a small’
percentage of U.S. Congress and federal
department heads as well as CEOS of
Fortune 500 companies.

Pitt baseball can’t seem to stop losing.

The team has dropped nine of its last 10
games since sweeping Georgia Tech on the
last weekend in March. ,

But April isn’t over yet, and breaking the
streak won’t get any easier this weekend with a
three-game home series against No. 20 Clem-
son that begins Friday night.

The good news for the Panthers? These

V games against Clemson are most likely Pitt’s

last against a ranked opponent in the regu-
lar season. The South Carolina school is the
third ranked team the Panthers will face this
month. The respite from top opposition will
bode well for Pitt’s-hopes of making the ACC

tournament, which expanded to include 10.

tearns this year. The Panthers currently trail
Duke and UNC, the ﬁfth— and fourth-place
teams, respectively, by one game in the Coastal
Division standings.

With afew out-of-conference games mixed
in, the Panthers play the remainder of their
ACC schedule against teams near the bottom
of the conference: Notre Dame, Boston Col-

No. 20 Clemson to visit struggling Panthers

lege and Maryland, which have a combined
conference record of 13-35.
But that’s in the-future. The focus is on
the present. ‘
Offense, or lack of it, has made up a large
part of the problem during the losing streak,

‘ as Pitt has failed to score more than two runs

in seven of its last 10 games.

The woes at the plate did not end Wednes-
day night against Kent State, when the Pan-
thers recorded just two hits in a 4-1 defeat.
Their only rtm came oﬁ' an error in the ﬁrst
inning. To junior outﬁelder Boo Vazquez, the
solution is simple.

“We have to be consistent in getting qual-
ity at-bats,” Vazquez said after the loss. “Even
if we’re not getting hits, we need to hit balls
hard, draw some walks and strike out less.”

When asked how to get out of their slump,
he and his teammates mentioned efficiency.
During this losing streak, Pitt has lacked pa-
tience at the plate.

Patiencewill be a necessary virtue against
this weekend’s opponent. The Tigers have one
of the most dominant starting rotations in
the ACC. Both Daniel Gossett and Matthew
Crownover have an ERA less than three runs

per game, and only one pitcher has an ERA
of more than four runs per game.

Still, the Panthers have reasons for op-
timism due to their impressive home con-
ference record. Pitt is 7-2 at home against
ACC opponents this season, including series
sweeps of Duke and then-No. 23 GeorgiaTech.
The only conference losses for.Pitt at home
this season came against top—ranked Virginia.

“I thinkwe’re comfortable at home,” senior

~ pitcher Matt Wotherspoon said. “We know

the guys behind us are comfortable and that
they’ll make plays.”

Pitt will have to improve on its pitching,
too, because the Tigers have one of the best
lineups in the ACC. Clemson has six batters
hitting above .300, led by Tyler Krieger’s .326.

Although their individual statistics are im-
pressive, Clemson has split its last 10 games.
With more consistent play, Wotherspoon be-
lieves his team has a chance to perform well
against a team that has been mediocre oflate.

“If we play hard, throw strikes and swing
the bat, we’ll put ourselves in a good position
to win the series,” he said.

First pitch on Friday is scheduled for 6

Alex Lavella’s strangest experience on
the job at Peter’s Pub happened one night
when a patron impersonated a bouncer.

“He was just taking people’s IDs and
telling people to leave. It was really weird,”
said Lavella, a junior pharmacy major who
bartends at Peter’s Pub on weekends.

While students dig deep into their wal-
lets at Oakland’s many bars to consume
pitchers of beer and shots, Lavella is part
of a group of students who proﬁt from
“Thirsty Thursdays.” These students ex-
perience both sides of the bar scene: the
authority behind the counter and the ex-
citement within the college bar setting.

“It’s so crazy that I don’t feel the need
to party. It’s a party where I work,” said
Nicholas Mcsadden, a sophomore po-
litical science major at Eastern Michigan
University.

Brew Gentlemen brewing beerﬂand hope in Braddock

Emma Kilcup
Staﬁ" Writer

There’s a renewal brewing in Braddock,
Pa.

Though it’s not open to the public
yet, The Brew Gentlemen Beer Co. began
making batches of its signature beers
at the end of March. In the last couple
months, its taproom has transformed
from piles of unsorted wood planks to
a weathered wood bar with wire chan-
deliers. While it’s not complete, the
vision is clear: The company will bring
something new to the Braddock and
Pittsburgh craft beer scenes.

“What we’re doing is not here yet,”
Asa Foster, co-founder of The Brew
Gentlemen, said. “We want something
a little more upscale, where people can
come hang out.”

For Foster and other co-founder
Matthew Katase, the idea of starting a
brewery grew from a Thanksgiving visit
to Foster’s family in Boston during their
junior year of college. Foster was study-
ing design at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity; Katase was studying math. Neither
wanted to commit to their fields for the
rest of their lives — they wanted to
start a brewery. Foster and Katase had
been independently homebrewing and
working together on entrepreneurial
projects, so the foundation was there.
On that trip in 2010, they decided they
were going to make it happen.

“One thing we had to do very early _

on was act like a company,” Foster said.

As juniors in college with only an
intangible idea, they had to prepare
to present to investors and convince
others that their idea was as brilliant

as they thought. Their first step: mak-
ing sure there was demand for their
product. '

v“There will always be a demand. Beer
is an affordable luxury,” Foster said.
“Breweries in the U.S. have a 2 percent
close. rate at the moment, which means
your building has to be burnt down to
stop brewing.”

Now, each founder offers his de-
gree-speciﬁc expertise: Katase is the
CEO, managing the money side of
things, while Foster does ‘the design

‘and marketing. The brewery plans on

fully opening by the end of April. Their
website and Facebook have frequent
updates on their progress.

To facilitate the brewing process,
The Brew Gentlemen hired a head
brewer, Brandon Capps, in February.
Capps graduated from Georgia Tech

with a degree in electrical engineering
in December and moved to Pittsburgh
to dive into the project. Capps said he
found the Brew Gentlemen after posting
on a job search site that he was looking
for a ground—level startup searching for
a head brewer.

“It was one of those things: From
moment one, it was an obvious fit,”
Capps said.

His interest in beer began early on,
as well, propelled by his position as a
systems design engineer for Anheuser—

Busch, along with his work at a small

brew pub called 5 Seasons in Atlanta
and as a home brewer, himself. Capps’
liking of beer matched that of Foster
and Katase. He even describes a certain
method of properly tasting beer: Inhal-

BARTENDERS

such as the Wisconsin Lunchbox — a cock-
tail featuring Coors Light, orange juice and
amaretto — he’s too young to sample the
end results of his recipes.

“It’s deﬁnitely very tempting knowing
that I have two years of watching people
drink around me. I guess I am getting a
head start on my 20s,” McSadden said.
“By the time I am 21, I will be used to the
bar environment.”

In both Michigan and Pennsylvania,
employees above the age of 18 can legally
serve alcohol in a licensedretail estab-
lishment. °

Lavella,_who was also younger than the
legal drinking age when she ﬁrst started
bartending, said bartending was a difficult
job to explain to her parents.

“No one wants their 19-year-old inthat
environment. But I told them that there
is no dream job that I will be able to make
enough money to pay for my rent,” sh
said. ' A ' l ‘

As many college students balance
schoolwork with working to cover ex-
penses such as tuition and rent, bartend-
ing provides the needed cash.

According to Lavella, bartending works
in a similar fashion to waitressing. The
minimum cash wage before tips in Pennsyl-
vania is $2.83 anhour + 70 cents greater
than the federal minimum — and tips are
at the discretion of the customers.

Sam Hietsch, a junior English literature
major, bartends at]o'e Mama’s in Oakland.
On nights when any of Pittsburgh’s sports
teams are winning, Hietsch said tips come
in easier. .

Flirting is another trick for quick cash
for some bartenders, and Mcsadden said
he’s frequently ﬂirted with girls at his bar
to get better tips.

Lavella said she has experienced a hand-
ful of peculiar experiences at Peter’s Pub.

“I have had a guy lick my arm once,
and sometimes you see people you know
getting in ﬁghts,” Lavella said.

Bartenders also have to deal with a dif-
ferent kind of ﬁght —- arguments over the
validity of a customer’s ID.

Hietsch said she once had a customer
who was wearing the same clothes in her
ID picture as she was when she presented
the ID at the bar, and her birthday on the

_......... ._..... \ ..._..._.- .— .. . ._ _..-.--.___.. - _..._-_. -_. _ _

card matched the current date .

“I just told her I couldn’t serve her. It
was pretty obvious [the ID] was a fake,”
Hietsch said. .

Lavella, who describes herself as an
“energy junl<ie,’_’ works four jobs — in-
cluding waitressing, promoting a local
beer company and working as a pharmacy
technician — to keep ﬁnancially stable.
She enjoys the “sense of independence”
working gives her.

“School is expensive, and I don’t like
asking my parents for money,” Lavella said.

While Lavella’s many hats might seem
tough to juggle, organizing her time helps
her balance the task. She advised students
to “take it on a little by little.”

“If you try too much at once, you will
end up quitting everything and missing
out,” Lavella says. ’

Joe Mama’s tends to cater more toward
families, UPMC hospital workers and visi-
tors having lunch, Hietsch said, and she’s
met some interesting people..

“You get to have conversations with
people. You get to talk to them and get
to know them. This is a chance to talk to
people that aren’t in school,” Hietsch said

For Hietsch, forming a bond with a
repeat customer whose wife had a mito-
chondrial disease is one of her fondest
memories of bartending atjoe Mama’s.

“He would come in every day, order a
lasagna with no sauce and extra mozzarella
cheese. We got to know him really well. He
was just a wonderfulguy,” Hietsch said.

» Andrew Miskowic, who graduated from
Pitt with a degree in ﬁlm studies in 2007,
can relate to Hietsch’s sentiments of enjoy-
ing working with people. Miskowic,‘ 28,
decided to get into bartending after gradu-
ation and currently bartends at Winghart’s
in Oakland.

“It is something that comes naturally
to me, working with people and working
in this industry,” Miskowic said.

Working in the service industry for
years and creating relationships with re-
peat customers helped Miskowic begin to
respect service workers more than he had
in the past. ~

“I think there is a stigma towards the
service industry — people think it is not a
real profession, but many of us are college-
educated,” Miskowic said. “It’s a job like
any other, and we are providing a neces-

’ sary service. There is nothing wrong with

being a bartender.” I -

Steven Mullett used to keep drink lists
from bars and scratch off which brews

he had tried — but now, there’s an app 4

for that.

Untappd, a free smartphone applica-
tion currently available on iOS, Android,
Blackberry and Windows Phone devices,
allows users to explore and share differ-
ent beers with their social circles. Users
can mark off which beers they have tried,
rate them and receive recommendations
based on their taste. More than 1 million
people have downloaded the app.

Mullett, a senior lab manager for Bill
Yates’ lab in Pitt’s Department of Cell
Biology, is an avid homebrewer and has
been using the app for almost a year. He
said he uses the app to keep track of his
beer legacy.

“It’s really easy to use, and it’s really
easy to ﬁnd beers. If it’s not, if it’s a mi-
crobrew, it’s very easy to add it to the

April 18, 2014 l The Pill News | v\/\/wv.pitlnevvs.c0m

Untappd connects beer aﬁcionados, newbies alike with A brews

database and then review it immediately
afterwards,” he said.

According to Mullett, the app is espe-
cially useful fo'r casual or intermediate
drinkers. Despite his experience with
microbrewing, he said the app is valuable
for him, too.

Greg Avola and Tim Mather launched
Untappd in October 2010. The pair has
been working together remotely on the
project from opposite coasts while main—
taining full—time jobs.

Avola, who works for ABC News’ Tech-
nology Team, said the idea behind the
app stemmed from adding context to the
concept of Foursquare, an app that allows
users to check in at different locations to
let their friends know where they are.

Avola and Mather wanted to focus on
a social industry, and the ﬁrst thing that
came to mind was beer. With Untappd,
users can not only check in at different
bars and breweries, but also keep track
of what they drank there.

“Beer is one of the ﬁrst things we

thought of because there really is no
Twitter or Facebook for beer,” Avola said.

Vincent Agresti, a senior information
science major, has been using the app
since 2011.

His reasoning for using the app echoed
Avola and Mather’s reason for creating
it — he can’t use Foursquare, Facebook
or Twitter to ﬁnd out about beer.

“It’s something that focuses on beer
enthusiasts, which is something that
other social networks don’t really do,”
Agresti said.

According to Agresti, he uses the beer
rating and recommendation features of
the app most frequently.

“Untappd is a good way for me to track
what beers I’ve drank, and it’s also a really

good tool for me to ﬁnd out new beers I _

mightlike,” he said.

Avola said the two—man team began
building a prototype injuly 2010 that only
allowed users to search for a beer and add
a location, but the app has evolved and
added new features since then.

9

For instance, users can now earn badg-
es for completing different tasks. If a user
logs three light beers, they are rewarded
with a “Lite Weight” badge.

The app operates with Wikipedia—style
editing. Any user can add a beer, but a
group of moderators and breweries go
through and check the listingsfor ac-
curacy.

According to Avola, breweries and
venues can also create accounts to con-
nect with customers, view analytics on
how their brewery is perceived and up-
load labels toaccompany their beers.

“The crux of what we’re trying to dois
to connect consumers with beer,” he said.

Breweries and venues can also spon-
sor badges, run specials on the app or
advertise events such as beer festivals.

Avola said the duo hopes to improve
the locality of recommendations in the
future, because beers are distributed in

the better accompaniment for cheese
than wine because of the diversity of

flavors. They plan to offer four ﬂagship

Float on: Yuengling’s ice cream makes a triumphant return

John Lavanga
A£°3°E Editor

Yuengling is a staple of the local beer
diet, occupying the space between
“cheap beer” and “fancy beer” with un-
assuming ease. Flavorful enough to be
worth payinglfor, but indistinct enough
to fit just about any occasion, it’s the
perfect fallback beer — be it a cook-
_ out, a wedding, a funeral or an awkward
 combination of all three. l
_ It might come as a surprise, then, that
ggthere wasa moment when Yuengling
= wasn’t known for its beer at all. Instead,
the company became synonymous with
another favorite on hot summer days:
i ice cream. Now, Yueng1ing’s Ice Cream
is back on. shelves, allowing intrepid

different parts of the country.

"‘We’re really focused on honing our
data to get local recommendations. We
think people will deﬁnitely ﬂock to that
new feature,” he said.

According to Matt McMahon, founder
of Eleventh Hour Brewing, an upcom-

ing Pittsburgh brewery still in its start-

up phase, said in an email that he uses
Untappd to gather feedback about his
company’s beers.

McMahon said Untappd allows him
to receive responses on Eleventh Hour’s
beers, and he has the ability to View users’

_ proﬁles to see how seriously their ratings‘

should be considered.

“I look at other beers they have
checked in to identify what styles they
like. If that person is an IPA fan and they
don’t like our IPA then maybe there is

something I need to look at,” he said. “On

the other hand, if that person consistently
checks in other IPAs that I consider to
be great beers, and gives them one to

two stars, then that person probably just

doesn’t like the IPA style and their feed-

, back illustrates that.”

McMahon said the app is also a useful
tool in gauging his performance.

“I feel like Untappd is a great resource
for brewers, old and new, to get feedback
on their beers,” he said. “While you will
always have outliers on the high and low
end of the scale, the general consensus
is what you want to take away from that
data.”

Avola said that there are thousands
of beers that consumers might not know
about. -

“Our goal is to help educate the com-
munity about what beer is out there,”
he said. ‘

Microbrews have been trending over
the last ﬁve years, Mullet said, and craft
and sour beers are becoming more popu-
lar. ~
“People are starting to open their eyes

to the fact that you can make beer taste

like anything you want,” he said.
Avola said people want more indepen-

dence in what they’re drinking.

“They want something different,
something more unique and fresh,” he
said. ﬂ

“There was a kid at Lowe’s the other '

.day who asked me why we’re starting a

business in Braddock, and I asked him

the last time he was in Braddock — he
said ﬁve years ago,” Foster said. “He
probably would have not had a good
time down here five years ago.”

Fosterdiscovered Braddock while in
a class at CMU that was focused on the
area. He explored, interviewed people
and fell in love.

“It’s got a weird energy toit. It’s.

weird, the fact that the town is only a
half-square mile. It’s not avvery com-
plicated place, until you get into it,”
Foster said. “This town is a place time
forgot —— it’s historical, it’s cool.”
Foster explains that the unmodern-
ized element has been both a blessing
and a curse. Ultimately, they are happy
with the location. And people are ex-
cited, always poking their heads in to
see how the progress is coming along
and asking about the beer. They want

their brewery to bring in people from
all over the city, but also from Brad-
dock, offering a high-end experience
that people can afford. .

“The ‘general sentiment that Brad-

dock is a place that needs a friend is
deﬁnitely catching on,” Foster said,
adding that “the reason Pittsburgh is
a steel town is because of Braddock.
This is where Andrew Carnegie built
the first steel mill.”

Now, it is the place where Kevin
Sousa Salt of the Earth’s owner has de-
cided to move and the place where the
self-proclaimed “food geeks” running
Brew Gentlemen hope to bring anoth-
er kind of culinary experience. In De-
cember, Bon Appétit magazine named
Pittsburgh the next big food town. Now,
Braddock is joining in the movement.

“The food scene here is exploding,

and we are totally on board to ride that,” .

Foster said. “We saw the very ﬁrst rum-
blings of that when we were deciding to
start things here. It was going in this
direction, but over the next few years
we realized it was going in this direction
and not going back.” ﬂ

Food pairing not just a game reserved for wine enthusiasts

Jackson Crowder
Staﬂ Writer

Wine gets all the credit.

It’s thought of as a sophisticated bev-
erage, meant for those with discerning
palates, possessed of the kind of delicate
ﬂavors that nothing else can touch — cer-
tainly not thing you’d say about beer.

Not only is that notion incorrect, it’s
responsible for beer being thought of as
a lesser drink. Nowhere does this come
through more than in the idea that wine is
the perfect libation to pair with food and
that beer is simply too overpowering, or
worse not good enough, to go with your
favorite dish.

Beer does indeed complement food,
and not just in the way that a Bud Light
washes down a’ hot dog or fried chicken.
It’s complex and varied enough in ﬂavor
to go with anything, be it greasy ballpark
food, a perfectly cooked steak, a piece of
ﬁsh or even dessert. That’s not to say that
every beer goes with everything. Far from

it. Just as a red wine would overwhelm a
delicate ﬁsh preparation such as grouper
or halibut and a white might not stand up
to a steak, some thought must be applied
to the pairing of food with beer.

The key to successfully pairing any
beverage to a dish is to strike a balance.
It can’t overpower the dish with its own
ﬂavor, but must stand out at the same
time. It should help bring out other ﬂa-
vors in the food and, likewise, the food
should help accent some of the drink’s
more subtle notes. How does one do this?
Well, here are a few handy guidelines to
keep in mind.

A light dish wants a lighter beer to go
with it. For example, a serving of pasta
with springtime vegetables would beneﬁt
from being paired with an easy drinking
pale ale or a good pilsner. Something like
Victory’s Prima Pils or Stone’s Pale Ale
would ﬁt the bill nicely here without mak-
ing themselves the focal point of the meal.
Additionally, any dish featuring a savory
citrus component or a sharp green like

arugula would go nicely with such beers.

Fish, excluding hardier varieties like
tuna or swordﬁsh, also demand a lighter
beer. A gentle wheat beer such as Harpoon’
UFO or Weihenstephaner Original would
go well. A Kolsch would not go amiss, ei-
ther. Try Sam Adams’ new Escape Route
or, if you can get your hands on it, Kolsch
151 by Blue Mountain Brewing Co.

A steak or meatier cut of pork wants a
big beer. Try a brown ale such as Indian
Brown Ale by Dogﬁsh Head or a mildly
hopped English bitter such as Fuller’s Lon-
don Pride. For a pork dish, something big
but a bit more gentle is required. Great
Lakes Eliot Ness, a Vienna lager similar
to Sam Adams’ Boston Lager, would do
nicely.

If a meat’s preparation is spicy — like
lamb vindaloo, for example — you can’t go
wrong with anything hoppy. The spicy hop
notes will complement the dish well and
should bring some of the beer’s sweeter
notes to the forefront.

Finally, don’t overlook dessert, as it’s

the perfect course for a dark beer to shine.
Anything involving chocolate would be
made all the better by a stout. Try Sam
Smith’s Oatmeal Stout or Lancaster’s Milk
Stout with that piece of chocolate cake
or scoop of chocolate ice cream. Vanilla
also goes well with dark beer, particularly
because so many of them pack vanilla
notes in their ﬂavor proﬁles. Brecken-
ridge Vanilla Porter would go well here,
as it’s lighter in body than most stouts and
would certainly accentuate the dessert’s
ﬂavor. Not feeling a stout or porter? No
big deal. Ommegang’s Three Philosophers
packs strong cherry notes as well as a
boozy sweetness that make it ideal for
most desserts, and a pretty good night-
cap, as well.

_ Next time you’re out on a date or cook-
ing dinner with your signiﬁcant other,
skip the wine and try pairing that dish of
yours with a good beer. You’ll be happy
you did, and if nothing else, you might
save a bit of money in the process. Bon
appetit and drink up! I

heart. In fact, Daniel Okrent, former
public editor at the New York Times and
author of “Last Call: The Rise and Fall
of Prohibition,” said, “What Yuengling
did was extremely common all over the
country.”

In fact, a number of major breweries
around the country — including such
industry monoliths as Pabst, Stroh and
Budweiser —— found themselves making
the switch over to ice cream when the
18th Amendment forced them to quit
brewing beer. 1

According to Okrent, along with
brewing non—alcoholic “near beer,”
these breweries used “anything they
could find that took advantage of the
facilities they had” to keep their busi-
nesses aﬂoat. Ice cream, which took
advantage of the breweries’ refrigera_-
tion units and nearby dairy farms, was
a natural fit.

however, the ice cream company shut

In February of this year, ‘Yuengling
Ice Cream went back on the shelves.
David Yuengling — who is the great-
grandson of Frank D. Yuengling and
second cousin of Yuengling Brewery
owner Dick Yuengling e decided that
after 30 years in the computer indus-
try, the time had come to return to his
roots. David Yuengling said that this,
combined with the fact that he “had
a lot of people,who asked us over the
years why we closed it down,” spurred
his interest in bringing back the brand.
Now, the company has 10 flavors and
is being carried by grocery stores in
Pennsylvania and elsewhere.

While the history of the.Yuengling

CROWDER”S CORNER

Building your own six pack:
A strategy guide to D’s six pax

Jackson Crowder
Stajf Writer

A trip to the vaunted beer cave at D’s Six Pax
and Dogz can be an overwhelming experi-
ence, even for a veteran beer nerd.
Hundreds of varieties, some quite rare
and obscure, are available at any given mo-
ment, which can lead to both COI'lﬁ.lSl01'I and
a total inability on the part of the buyer to
make a decision. One look around the cave,
which is stocked ﬂoor to ceiling with one of
the most amazing selections around, and
any beer lover will become overwhelmed by

' an urge to buy everything in sight. If you’re

like me, however, this is simply not an op-
tion. Decisions must be made. Fortunately,

‘ there’s a system at D’s that will enable you to V

build a six—pack and get the most bang out
of the considerable buck you’ll be spending.

The system is based less on speciﬁc
beers to target than it is on ﬁlling niches.
Of course, anyone who loves a particular
style can buy six different IPAs or stouts and
be perfectly happy with their purchase. But
with such a wide variety available, it seems
a shame to not explore a bit and see what
the cave has to offer.

With that in mind, the perfect D’s six-
pack should hit on each of the following

1 categories: an old favorite, a pale ale or

IPA, a German or Belgian variety, a dark
beer, a wildcard and a shot in the dark. Fol-

. lowing this formula ensures several things.

It makes sure that you know that you’re
getting at least one great beer, courtesy
of the old favorite. It ensures that you’ll
spend maximum time exploring the cave,
which will inevitably lead to more dis-
coveries. And, it keeps the adventurous,
experimental nature of a visit to the cave
alive, while also preventing you from going
totally insane —— a legitimate possibility in
the beer cave.

I employed the formula in my most re-
cent trip to D’s. . A

After choosing an empty six—pack from
the basket (Bell’s Kalamazoo Stout, because
I wanted to look cool), I circled the cave, try-
ing to locate any new offerings that required
research. After steadying myself, I went
straight for the United Kingdom section

and picked out Skull Splitter, an intense and
boozy ale from Scotland’s Orkney Brewery.
Possibly my favorite beer in the world, it
easily ﬁllﬁlls the old favorite category and
singlehandedly makes a trip to D’s worth it.

Next, I picked up Stone Go To IPA
for something hoppy. Those looking for
something more intense will not be disap-
pointed, as the cave backs a brilliant IPA
and pale ale selection —— with some more
abusive than others.

With two slots ﬁlled, I walked to the mas-
sive shelfof Belgian and German selections.
This can be an intense moment for anyone

I ‘in the cave, regardless of experience. Un-
less you really know what you’re looking at ’

here, play it safe, since these beers can get
expensive fast’.

Not feeling the heavy yeastiness of a
Belgian variety, I chose Ayinger Celebrator,
a much ballyhooed doppelbock from Aying,
Germany. The dark beer selection was easy,

as North Coast’s beloved Old Rasputin Rus— _

sian Imperial Stout was available for a mere
$3.75. Yes, please.

This left two slots left, the wildcard and
the total shot in the dark. While these cat-
egories may sound the same, they’re based

on different logic. The wildcard is a beer

you’ve heard of but don’t know much about
and have never tried, whereas the shot in
the dark is essentially a way to justify pick-
ing a really cool bottle. The wildcard came,
once again, from Scotland -— in the form
of Williams Bros.’ Alba Scots Pine Ale, a
herbaceous ancient ale that has lately been
garnering attention stateside. .
Finally came the total shot in the dark,
in which I might as well have closed my eyes
and picked at random. This seems risky,
but given the selection at D’s, it’s unlikely
that you’ll make a bad choice. After some
more wandering, I picked Full Sail Session
Black Lager, an easy- drinking schwarzbier
from Oregon. And yes, the bottle was as
cute as a button. ‘
All of this amounted to a total cost of
$20.22. It sounds expensive (and it is), but
it’s easy to spend much more at D’s if you
don’t go in with an organized approach.
Plus, the variety and quality in a singlesix
pack pays for itself. I I .

  Using beer in recipes a refreshing way to use the brew

Grace Kelly
Suﬁ Wrz'ter_

As college students, the thought of put-
ting precious alcohol into a food dish may
seem wasteful, or at least counterintuitive.

' Though that six-pack of Coors Light is just

"begging to be poured into a solo (cup or
chugged from the can, consider impress-

ing your friends with a food spread that

can not only be accompanied by beer, but
also has beer infused into it. (Note: This

is not promoting the use of Coors Light .

in these recipes.Just no.)

. The question at hand is how are these
recipes better with beer? Beer gives an
umami depth to many dishes, and, in bak-
ing, helps provide a light, airy texture.
As for taste, the hoppy infusion can cut

the fattiness of rich meats and add depth '

to stews and vegetables. Red cabbage is
excellent when stewed in a hard cider and
served with beer-braised pork loin, the
sweet and savory ﬂavors melding into a
puddle of caramelized meaty goodness.

And with summer around the corner,
throw some brats on the grill.and try bast-
ing them in a malty beer such Auroch’s
Horn golden ale or a spicier Sam Adams
Noble Pils. Throw one in a. bun, slather
with mustard and pile on sauerkraut and
you have the ultimate taste of summer.

These recipes are adapted from Food’

Network star Ina_ Garten, with some
changes especially for a Pitt News audi-
ence. -

Beer-battered ﬁsh ‘n’ chips

One of my favorite dishes to make with
beer is ﬁsh ‘n’ chips. It’s a more traditional
recipe that uses beer, but if done with a
good beer and a good piece of ﬁsh, the
results can be sublime. Beer-provides not
only a light airiness to the batter, but a
hoppy sort of cloud that encapsulates each
bite of ﬂaky ﬁsh. To elevate the humble
dish to even higher realms of glory, serve
with freshly made “chips” sprinkled with
sea-salt and splashed with a dash of malt
vinegar. These aren’t your frozen food

‘Game of Thrones’-themed beer provides fiery spice

Stephanie Roman
Staﬂ W riter

Daenerys Targaryen, the only sur-
viving child of King Aerys II, de-
posed by King Robert Baratheon
and competitor for the Iron Throne
of Westeros, once said, “I will take
what is mine with ﬁre and blood.”
Such is the name of Ommegang
Brewery of Cooperstown, N.Y., and
HBO’s newest beer in the “Game
of Thrones” brewing series, Fire
and Blood, released just in time for
the show’s Season 4 premiere. The
beer series moved from ablonde ale
with Iron Throne to a black stout
in Take the Black Stout to the Fire
and Blood red ale — anotherﬁtting
name. Though the khaleesi isn’t op-
posed to drinking blood, the beer
named and designed after her trio
of dragons doesn’t_taste anything
like that —— fortunately.

Rather, this particular ale is a

April 18, 2014 I The Pitt News I wx/\A/vpittnevvsoom

mixture of fruitiness, spiciness and

malt. It’s thick and hop—heavy with a

really satisfying dark red coloration
ﬂecked with gold wheat, strongly
reminiscent of dragons’ breath.
Initial sweetness from raisins and
other dark fruits quickly gives way
to the heat of ancho chilies and the
chocolatey taste of malt. Fire and
Blood comes in at 6.8 percent ABV
for a75o milliliterbottle, so it’s not
going to knock anyone out if you'go
easy, but if you’re someone with the
alcoholic preferences of the delicate
Sansa Stark, daughter of Catelyn
and Ned Stark, former Lord ofWin-

terfell, the heaviness and aroma of i

the beer probably won’t interest
you. If you fancy yourselfmore like
notoriously skilled drinker Tyrion
Lannister, the half—man and uncle
of King Joffrey Baratheon, you’ll

probably really enjoy the robust— _

ness of this beverage.

Very interestingly, Fire and A

Blood is the ﬁrst of the ales to come
with multiple labels. Three versions
exist, each with a different one of
Dany’s dragons on it. The bottles
are packaged at random, so each
distributor could have different
options, which makes the hunt a
bit more exciting. As a recommen-
dation, one is obviously more epic
than the others and features some

_ awesome ﬁre—breathing—dragon ac-

tion on the front — most accurately

portrayingthe ideology the beer is p

supposed to represent.

Let Fire and Blood linger in your‘

mouthforafew moments and allow
your taste buds to soak up its smoky‘
nuances. Take it slow at first, as it
starts off a bit shocking and.bit-
ter. Once you’re accustomed to the
unconventional blend of heat and

ﬁuitiness, though, it’s aperfect beer . '
to down on'Sunday nights when l

everyone’s favorite HBO show‘ is on.

Media reports of the demise of Four
Loko, the popular alcoholic beverage,
proved to be “totally bogus” and a
“#-falsealarm,” according to the com-
pany’s Twitter account.

Phusion Projects, the Chicago-based
company behind Four Loko ﬂavored
malt beverages, settled last month
with attorney generals from 20 states,
including Pennsylvania, and the city
attorney of San Francisco over allega-
tions that the company encouraged dan-
gerous misuse of their products and
marketed its product toward underage
consumers.

Four Lokos gained popularity and
notoriety during the days when the
drink pre—mixed alcohol with caffeine
levels equal to two cups of coffee. CNN
reported in 2010 a police investiga-
tion that called the drinks a “blackout

u

in a can,” because of its ingredients.
Phusion Projects removed the caffeine
after the Food and Drug Administration
issued the company a warning letter
that year.

News site DNAinfo Chicago misin-
terpreted the settlement and falsely
reported on March 25 that the com-
pany would terminate production of
Four Loko. The company reassured its
Twitter followers in late March that the
death sentence was a mistake and that
the rumors Four Loko had been taken
off the market indeﬁnitely were false.

The case was a mu-ltistate investi-
gation of Phusion Projects led the
attorney general offices of Arizona
and Maryland. Senior Deputy Attorney
General Jessie Smith handled the case
for the Pennsylvania office of Attorney
General. According to the settlement,

Phusion Projects depicted individuals V

who appear to be underage persons or
misusing alcohol on their social media

accounts in addition to using images of

Santa Claus inltheir advertisements. _
As part of the settlement, Phusion

Projects has agreed to not encourage

mixing caffeine with alcohol, hire mod'- l

els or actors who appear to be under
the age of 21 to promote the company’s
alcoholic products, promote ﬂavored
malt beverages on university properties
except in retail establishments orfdepict
the misuse of alcohol or consumption
by underage persons on its media ac-
counts. 

Not much is setto change around
Pitt’s campus.

Students and local beer distribu-

tors said they do not remember seeing ‘

physical promotional advertising for
the product, and the majority of the al-
legations were web—based. The product
is_ still on the market, and according
to Phusion Project’s product lojcatoir,
is available at more than 5()_ lo'catio'r/ls

within a 10 mile radiusof the University. '

The drink contains between 6 per-
cent and 12 percent alcohol by volume,
depending on state regulations. At 12
percent, the drink contains the alcohol
equivalent of four to ﬁve regular beers.

The settlement cited two holiday ad-
vertisements as evidence. In the first

Santa Claus on Christmas beers and
European beers, such as the label on
Penn Brewery’s St. Nikolaus‘Bock Bier, a
seasonal holiday beer available between
November and January.

“Everyone likes Santa Claus,” Honc-
zar said, drawing a comparison between
the advertisement and beer label. “I
don’t think anyone would say [Penn
Brewery is] trying to market towards
children.” ‘ ' .

Smith said the attorney generals led
an investigationof Phusion Projects, as
they believed the company was market-
ing toward youth through social media

and speciﬁc advertisements, as well as
continuing to encourage the combina-
tion of alcohol and caffeine.

Although Phusion Projects removed
caffeine from the product’s recipe,
Smith said the company hosted contests
soliciting drink recipes that combined
their products with Coca-Cola, coffee
and other caffeinated liquids, which

‘ would result in a similar effect of the

original Four Loko recipe.

Smith said she believes the cessa-
tion of this promotionwill beneﬁt state
residents. A portion of the $400,000
monetary settlement will also be used

Phusion Projects President Jim Sloan
said in an email that his company did
not violate any laws and disagrees
with the allegations, but considers the
agreement away to move forward and
highlight the company’s commitment
to responsibility. . T
Sloan said his company monitors its so-
cial media sites, removes unacceptable
posts and utilizes “age-gates,” which
require visitors to enter their date of
birth to ensure only adults who are 21
and older can view the content.

“This is not an easy task, because of
the constantly evolving nature of social
media,” Sloan said. .

The U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion warned Phusion Projects in .2010
that caffeine was not a legal additive
in alcoholic beverages and warned the
company to decaffeinate Four Loko af-
ter the drink was blamed for a series
of emergency room visits, fatal car ac-
cidents and resulting wrongful death

lawsuits.

Shepard Siegel, a professor at Mc-
Master University in Ontario, Canada,
published the report “The Four-Loko
Effect” in 2011 claiming that caffeine
is not the deﬁnitive culprit. _

“Rather, it is likely that Four Loko-
type drinks are especially effective as
intoxicants because they provide alco-
hol in an unusual context,” Siegel said
in his report. I

According to Siegel, drug and al-
cohol tolerance partially results from
what cues consumers associate with the
drug, and when altered — such as by
changing the container, taste, environ-
ment or method of consumption —— the
consumer’s tolerance lowers. Siegel said
Four Loko has “novel flavoring” meant
to taste like fruity flavors such as wa-
termelon and blue raspberry.

Sloan said in his statement that Phu-
sion Project still believes adults can
consume alcohol and caffeine combi-
nations safely.

Diana Bellisario, owner of Mel-
linger’s Beer Distributor, said she does
not remember Phusion Projects adver-

“I think it was just that everylj;_;.g:c:ly
was hearing about it. It was new. 
body else had ever [mixed caffeineaiid
alcohol in a can],” Bellisario “I
guess that’s why it took off that way?’
Bellisario said she does not remem-
ber exact numbers, but she remembers
that Four Loko soldwell before Phusion

L Projects removed the caffeine —,—’ but

not as well as other popular products,
,such as Natural Light Beer. g 
“The numbers weren’t fantastic, but

it was ood,’1’lBellisario said. “I carr it 2
8‘ 3’

now, but seriously it just sits.”

. Bellisario said she doesn’t believe the
company was pursuing a young crowd,
and did not have any instances where
underage people attempted to buy Four
Loko at her store.

However, while Bellisario and Honc-
zar said their customer base is-primarily
21-25 years old, Bellisario said ‘older
customers in their 30s and 40s did not
