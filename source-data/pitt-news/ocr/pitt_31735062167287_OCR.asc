An increasing interestin the
University‘s role in urban affairs
has been shown recently by stu-
dents. faculty and the administra-
tion. Petitions. such as the one
proposing an Afro-American Pro-
gram submitted by Student Gov-
ernment and those currently cir-
culating among the faculty con-
cerning city race relations. indi-
cate this growing interest.

Action has already been taken
by Chancellor Wesley Posvar.
who established a University
Council on Urban Programs un-
der the chairmanship of the Vice
Chancellor for Program Devel-
opment and Public Affairs. indi-
cating the administrations con-
cern with urban affairs.

This concern comes at a time
when the failure of the nation.

Gulf of Tonkin Controversy

Mr. McNamara Outlines Descri

by PAUL STOLLER, Editor
Never before in the course of human events has so much
been said erroneously in such a short period of time. This state-
ment perfectly describes the evidence presented to the public

concerning the two naval inci-
dents in the Gulf of Tonkin in
1964.

It is hard to forget the fearful
and penetrating television appear-
ance of President Johnson on a
balmy August night ju st four
years ago. The President told the
public of the two “unprovoked"
North Vietnamese naval attacks
of the USS Maddox and Turner
Joy. Mr. Johnson told the Ameri-
can populace and the Congress
that the two destroyers were mere-
ly on a "routine mission in inter-
national waters." Later in his ad-
dress. he annouced that a US re-
taliation had begun and that US
planes were bombing North Viet-
namese naval installations.

Two days later. the Johnson

 Administration through the able

means of Defense Secretary Rob-

 

Joh i

   

Congress and subsequently the
public with a detailted and co-
gent description of the two naval
incidents that caused US retalia-
tion.

McNamara maintained that the
first incident involved the USS
Maddox, a naval destroyer on a
“routine patrol in international
waters.” On August 2, the Mad-
dox “was attacked by three PT
craft at 3:08 p.m. She opened fire
with her five inch battery after
three warning shots failed toislow
down the attackers,” said McNa-
mara.

During the attack the Maddox
scored a direct hit. sinking one
of the attacking ships. There was
no injury to the personnel on
board the Maddox.

The following day. President

fectively to the urban situation
indicates the lack of research and
specialized personnel. The Uni-
versity. as an urban school. has
both the opportunity and the re-
sponsibility to help provide both
a research base and manpower to
aid Congress.

Although government increas-
ingly realizes the need to support
education, effective results may
be slow in developing. Steps to
solve the urban problems must
be. and are being taken by the
University. In recent years, the
University’s urban program was
surveyed under contract with the
Department of Community Af-
fairs of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, which is evidence
that the state looks to the Uni-
versity to indicate the direction
for meeting with future needs of
the urban population.

namese Government. w a r n i n g
them against any further aggres-
sion on the high seas. On the
Tonkin Gulf Waters. the Maddox
was joined by the Turner Joy. and
there patrols that day were with-
out incident.

However. it was on August 4-
a day that turned the tide of the
Vietnamese War—-that the US des-
troyers were allegedly engaged
in the second naval incident. Sec-
retary McNamara reported the
"destroyers relayed messages that
they had been under repeated at-
tack and t at they had sunk two
of the attac fng craft. The inci-
dent took ‘place roughly 65 miles
from the neared t land! and conse-

   
 

  

 
  
 

Dumbauld Hits

Un-American ,

Activities At University
by ALAN E. BARR

Peter Dumbauld.

a former member of the state house of

representatives. has called for an investigation into .“un-Ameri-
can activities“ at the University and for a halt to state-aid. This
move comes in response to an ad in the April 3. issue of The
Pitt News. This ad. signed by forty-seven faculty members, sup-
ports those Pitt students who have decided to refuse military ser
vice in their protest of the Vietnam War.

“Anybody who receives state
aid should be patriotic to their
country." said Mr. Dumbauld.
It is Mr. Dumbauld‘s feeling that
the ad in question constitutes an
“unpatriotic act"; and as a result.
if such acts are continued. state
aid to the University should be cut
off. Mr. Dumbauld sent letters
with these requests to Governor
Shaffer and the state Attorney
General.

The April 3rd ad itself con-
cerns “Pitt students who are no
longer accepting their draft de-
ferments." These students have
taken steps to bring on induction
and then refused military service
to show their opposition to the
war in Vietnam. Students who re-
fuse the draft face a five year jail
sentence.

The University has a strong ur-
ban affairs program in both the
Arts and Sciences and the Profes-
sional Schools. Many relevant
courses and seminars are offered.
such as a doctoral program in ur-
ba n affairs. Also community
medical programs and outpatient
services in the School of Dentis-
try are provided. University li-
braries have contributed to many
urban research projects.

Although academically - based
solutions for the city's problems
are important. the University
feels that students must not only
be equipped with the knowledge
and skill to cope with present
problems. but be willing to tackle
impending crises.

quently was considered a breach
of international law on the part
of the North Vietnamese. accord-
ing to the Defense Secretary.

After a mere six hour delibera-
tion, the National Security Coun-
cil was convinced -— it was cer-
tain — that the second attack had
taken place. With this absolute
certainty, the President decided
to retaliate. Mr. McNamara stat-
ed: “The deliberate and unpro-
voked nature of the attacks at lo-
cations that were indisputably in
international waters compelled
the President and his principle
adivsors to conclude that a prompt
and firm military response was
required.

In short span of six hours. the
administration decided to escalate
the war by bombing the North.
In the next three installments this
completely dif-
the Tonkin-Gulf

 
  

     

    
 
 

 

The ad points out that the stu-
dents who take this action do so
under their own initiative. How-
ever. the forty-seven faculty mem-
bers who sponsored this ad are
supporting these students because
“they cannot avoid considering

their relationship. as their elders V

and teachers. to those students

who have made this choice.”

These faculty members have asked
if “they can let them (these stu-

dentsldisappear for five years

without any response on their
part?" i

These professors realize that it
is difficult for many people to
share and understand the faith
these students have in the “future
of this country." However. these
professors" suppose that if enough
young people take this action and
thereby secure some measure of
response. it may make a difference
for the future.

In closing the ad. these forty-
seven faculty members “call upon
their colleagues on the University
of Pittsburgh faculty to join them
in a collective and public declara-
tion of their support for the Pitt
students who are showing their
opposition to the war by refusing
military service.

In White America depicts the
roll of American Negroes during thr
centuries as black men in white

America. Dubermans work is
based entirely on authentic his-
toric documents. and the result
is a vivid and moving drama in
which the characters speak out in
their own words——turning history
and fact into a valid and meaning-
ful experience.

The New Yorker writes. "I don't

Rockefe11er’s Candidacy

Sparks Republican Debate

by-EARL JACOBS

..{i'r'1'<)ice: Rockefeller. the na-
tional student-youth committee
supporting Nelson Rockefeller
for the Republican presidential
nomination. has increased its
activity followihg Rockefel-

ler‘s announcement last week to
run for the presidency.

The organization was original-
ly formed in conjunction with a
nationwide petition drive to ob-

ler Registrar"; a stepped up cam-
paign for Rockefeller in CHOICE

colleges and universities which
was sponsored by Time magazine
recently: and support of Governor
Rockefeller in campus and state
mock elections.

Bruce Kelly. Executive Director
of Choice: Rockefeller. said that
the group hopes to impress upon
the Republican Party the impor-
tance of nominating a man who
is a responsible alternative to
Richard Nixon and who can de-
feat the Democratic candidate in
November.

Kelly added. “The response
clearly shows that students agree
with the governor's statement
that if he is nominated. he can
be elected."

Kelly mentioned that despite
the surge of pro—McCarthy and
Kennedy sentiment on the East
coast.

Polls in other parts of the na-
tion indicate that students con-
sider Rockefeller the strongest
realistic candidate.

A major effort will be made by
the group to present Rockefeller's
record during twenty—seven years
of public service. and to keep

informed as the Governor speaks
out on major issues.

No Republican has a better ap-
preciation of the relationship of
federal. state and municipal gov-
ernments. which. outside of for-
eign affairs. will certainly be the
chief problem of the next Presi-
dent. Rockefeller. as governor of
New York. has improved the state's
educational system. housing. and
transportation. Under Rockefel-
ler. New York became the first
state to have a minimum wage
act. and the state has the nation's
most generous medical aid pro-
gram.

Rockefeller has been active in
foreigh affairs. As Assistant Sec-
retary of State for Latin America
under President Roosevelt. his
work helped lead to the forma-
tion of the NATO Alliance. Re-
cently. Rockefeller called for a
reversal of United States policy
in Viet Nam. and urged a summit
meeting of Asian leaders to consi-
der prospects for peace.

Choice: Rockefeller recently
selected approximately 700 co-
ordinators on college campuses
across the nation to further its
goals. The organization. which
is being financed entirely by pri-
vate donations. has been approved
by the Coalition for a Republican
Alternative.

Who can say for sure what is American and un-
American‘?

What super patriot can differentiate between
what is to the left and what is to the right of the
thin line of patriotism.

What one person has the right to stand-up and
point his finger and say: This action is un-Ameri-
can.

IN THE EARLY fifties. one
man felt it his burden to uncover
the Un-American. He was a spec-
tacle unmatched in American po-
litics. H e insulted Presidents.
humiliated generals. and placed
himself above the authority of the
United States Senate.

A senator. his name was Joseph
R. McCarthy. And for the Ameri-
can public. he brought with him
a plague called McCarthyism.

.McCarthy. beginning in 1950. rode a wave of
anti-Communism speeches to the summit. He began
his climb in Wheeling. W. Va.. February 9. 1950.

THERE HE ACCUSED government officials of
being Communist agents. "still working and mak-
ing policy." he said.

He carried through with his arguments. his ac-
cusations. and his politiking and formed his lonely
road to the top.

In 1953. the US neared the end of the war with
Korean Communists. President Truman had negoti-
ated an armistice. but with McCarthysim rampag-
ing throughout the land. the Democratic administra-
tion couldn't afford to give McCarthy additional
grounds for impugning its loyalty.

THE ADMINISTRATION couldn’t afford to
be called Un-Americans. though it sought a peace-
ful solution to the war and a return to America for
US soldiers and sailors.

Today. the US is in Vietnam and a different
Democratic administration attempts to achieve a
peaceful solution to war. Today also. there are poli-
ticians like McCarthy who point fingers.

Fact: Joseph R. McCarthy was born November 14, 1909.
Fact: joseph R. McCarthy was elected to‘the United States

Opinion: McCarthy was . . . known as a cheap politician of

vulgar, flamboyant ways and a casual approach to the public inter-
est.—Richard H. Rovers, author-journalist.

Joseph R.—An Anti-Unamerican

They call themselves American. and they at-
tempt to defend their country. For the voting popu-
lace. they go on record against the Un-Americans;
those who dissent. those who resist. and those who
just want the US to get out of Vietnam.

THESE POLITICIANS always stand near the
Stars and Stripes. trying to associate with patriot-
ism. They are the type of politician who reeks with
jingoism. And like McCarthy in the fifties. they are
in the mood of Fascism and Hitlerism.

To get at the Un—American. McCarthy fought

fire with fire. He used the same tactics as the Com-—

umnists.

<1) The multiple untruth: ‘

<2» The abuse of documents:

43) Insinuation and innuendo:

(4) The slander amalgam:

<5) Intimidation:

(6) Attributing significance to irrelevant:
(7) The bluff and the diversionary gambit:
(8> The personal spy network:

(9) Contempt for the law. and

(10) The unfounded charge of treason.

MCCARTHY HURT constitutional government
with his network of informers. He spread disunity
at home by undermining the peoples faith in their
highest civilian and military leaders. And he spread
disunity in the free world because he stood for a
fanatical and unreasonable fore. But above all the
McCarthy spirit is characterized by a contempt for
the intellectuals without which a country would
die.

With McCarthyism ringing in the peoples’ ears
during the fifties. if one neighbor called another
neighbor “A dirty Commie." the latter from that
moment became the victim of inflammed hatred.

TODAY, THE GHOST of McCarthy lingers in
other political aspirants. They call for a new US
patriotism. and speak out critically of the Un-Amer-
icans.

But these men who sit in judgment must also be
judged. But by what standards are these men judged
to be Americans themselves‘?

For that matter. in today‘s world. how can any-
one be certain of the true definition and the true
image of America.

 

 

Fact: Joseph R. McCarthy gains public stature through his
anti-Communism investigations, 1950-53.

Opinion: McCarthy is the only major politician in the country
who can be labeled "liar” withoutfear of libel.—-Josephand Stewart

ing Un—American, or Communists, February 9, 1950.

Editor, The Pitt News:

"As one who is as yet uncommitted to any one
candidate, but an aversion to Richard Nixon, I had
watched with great admiration as all the young
people threw t.hernselves into the campaign for
Senator McCarthy. ‘

Thought I-“They DO care. They Do ha-ve ideals
and a sense of purpose. They DO listen to a man
who has a temperateness about the issues, but a
man of action who thinks, and dared to be a man
of principle when others ducked the responsibility.”

Then I read a news item in the paper which
caught me right in the middle of my hurrahs: 300
member Student for McCarthy group switch to
Kennedy; because McCarthy’s campaign had run
out of gas.

What a letdown. Who is out of gas. Not Mc-
Carthy. '

I guess I cannot understand that kind om com-
mitment-blowing in the wind-going for money,
power, and cliches; instead of a tested man who
has a moral conviction and dares to voice it and

who represented you young people when the other

Irishman was playing “eeny meeny” with his pro-
fessed views. (Enclosed is an editorial opinion.)

CAN McCARTHY WIN?

There is a perplexing, frustrating, and almost
uncontrollable odor in the political air these days
which could in the end foul the otherwise stunning
McCarthy movement; it is the apparent feeling of
many Democrats that although McCarthy is the
man of principle and ability in the party, Kennedy
is the man who can win, and that anyone who looks
at the situation realistically, therefore, must sup-
port Kennedy.

This attitude translates into the opinion that
McCarthy just doesn’t have the political sense to
win an election. It manages to ignore the elections
McCarthy has been winning for the past twenty
years. And the attitude also manages to work up
rather extreme myopia toward the senator's recent
political fortunes.

KENNEDY, ON THE OTHER hand, is not neces-
sarily the political wizzard so many assume him to
be. He brought down on his own head the same
charges of ruthlessness which have followed him
across the country in the past couple of weeks when
he got into the senatorial race in New York in
1964. Then, as recently, he first said that he could
not imagine circumstances compelling him to run,
and shortly afterwards announced that he was a
candidate. The difference in 1964 was that Kennedy
changed his mind two more times before he finally
decided on his status as a candidate. Such action

Grid Competition Intensifies;

There were nearly as many spectators at Pitt Stadium early
' Saturday morning for the scheduled scrimmage as there were

~ healthy football players. but everyone went home somewhat disap-

pointed. Soggy fields and inclement weather caused its cancellation.
‘ Last Saturday a scrimmage was also cancelled because of bad

weather. Instead. there was a
full scrimmage last Wednesday.

In that one. the offense. under
the direction of four quarterbacks.
scored four touchdowns and the
defense scored one. adding an in-
terception and a fumble recovery.

Dave Havern, who is in the
thick of the battle for the starting
quarterback job, accounted for
two scores on a short pass to Bill
Pilconis and a long bomb to Joe
McCain. 2

During Frank Gustine's turn at
the helm. fullback Jeff Brown
scored the only touchdown on a
49-yard ramble on a draw play.
Chuck Winters tossed a 5-yard
touchdown to George Medich for
the final score.

Linebacker Joe Laws scored the
only touchdown for the defense
when he blocked Joe Spicko’s
punt and ran over 30 yards with
the ball into the end zone. Line-

“Talent that’s proven is_ talent,”
commented Hart, “not untried

right now, except Ed Gallin, is
new. Without question, though,
we do have more depth and abili-
ty than before at linebacker.”

to be back before the end of this
week. That leaves the defense

“The Prowler will be a line-
backer with good pass defense."
described Hart. “Hes got a lot
more ground to cover. He's got to
be a good athlete.“

Hart's got the athletes: now he's
looking for some good weather.

Full ScrimmageWashed Out

FOOTBALL DRILLS continue to build towards next Saturday’s annual
Blue-Gold football game. Last Saturday’s scrimmage was cancelled be-
cause of wet fields, but the players are hard at work again this week.

 

Baseballers Split Two;

The struggling Panther baseballers seem to be making one-

run games a habit.

Last Thursday the baseball team traveled to Grove City with a
mediocre 8-7 record. ready for a “break out that never hzmpened.

game in the tenth inning. the
left-handed ace was tapped for
only one hit. But Grove City took
advantage of sloppy Panther field-
ing and managed to put three runs.
across the plate.

The mitters scored three runs
also; but in the bottom half of the
eleventh inning, second basemen
Tony Carr blasted a deep drive
over left fielder Bobby Kohl’s
head to knock home the winning
run and give Grove City a 4-3
victory.

the Panthers did “break out”. but
found themselves in another tight
game. But this time. the matters
were on the top end of a one-run

and third. first baseman Tom
Smith lofted a high fly ball to
right field. allowing Ken Cooke
to tag up and score the wihning
run.

“That was the first game that
we were able to put all of our hits
together,” said Lewis. “In all the
other games, one or two men
woulp hit, but no-one else would.
Against Indiana State, everyone
hit well.”

Despite the hitting. Lewis
doesn’t expect Thursday’s game
against. Westminster to be a run-
away either.

“Westminster will probably be
tough.” explained Lewis. “They

Both Nichols and Stromp had

Nichols dropped his first set to

take the final two sets 6-3, 6-1.
“Bill was hitting into the net and

explained the coach, “but he ad-

Banner explained that "Salters take off was much

better. and this was his first big competition out-

doors. " Salter also finished fourth ih the triple jump.

Another thinclad, who broke a personal record but
did not win, was Roger Holly. Contributing to a
fourth place finish in the sprint medley, Holly raced
to his fastest time in the half mile, posting the time

Banner stated that his squad pleased him and that
everyone improved. Even though no one captured a
first place. Banner had reason to be overjoyed.

"We were up against the best in the East. Sixty
or seventy schools were entered. They were all tough
competitors. and Villahova has a great squad." re-
marked the coach.

Bob Salembrier. number two

Keith McMonagle 6-4.6-2. Mc
Monagle went into the match
with 25 consecutive victories un-
der his belt. "Bob didn't realize

Pope.

In other singles matches, Chuck

Lewis plans to use Frankie Gus-
tine as his starting pitcher. But
Lewis seems a bit shaky about
how well his right-hander will
perform. Gustine was knocked out
of the box in the fourth ihning
against Indiana State.

“The spring football practices
have been hurting Gustine." ad-
mitted Lewis. “There’s a big dif-
ference between tossing footballs
and pitching baseballs; there’s a
different motion involved. And
Gustine‘s arm is a little stiff from
the scrimmages.”

Go1flTeam Shoots Well at Bucknell,
Gets Spring’s Sixth Loss, 1 1‘/2-9‘/2

by ED CONLEY

A disappointing season con-
tinued Saturday as the varsity

golf team lost their sixth match
1112-912. to Bucknell. The team has
won three.

Coach Rex Peerv reflected his
feeli_ngs on the poor showing. “We
were expecting more: were trying
hard. But. we cant put it over
well.

“Either something doesn't go
right. or the opposition is tough."
he adds.

The opposition has been rougher
than Peery had thought it would
be, and he feels the worst part
of the spring has yet to come. This
should hold true today when a

duel match is scheduled at Shan-1

nopin against Ohio U. and Indiana
State. Both teams beat the golgers
last year and the coach feels that
they both have good squads again.

After that the Easterns follow
at Princeton May 11-12. Peery
will send the limit of seven men
and doesn’t know whether he
should expect much or not.
“They're expecting to do some-

 

in his match against Bucknells

thing there." is all that he can
say.

The effort was present at Buck-
nell as it has been all season, but
the victory just wasn’t there.
“Kill above three lines.

The effort was present at Buck-
nell as it has been all season. but
the victory just wasn‘t there.

“Bryan played real good. So
did McGuire, Golden, and Me-
teney.” the coach mentions.

Bryan did shoot well. Saturday.
coming up with a 74. the team's
best score. He took all three points
