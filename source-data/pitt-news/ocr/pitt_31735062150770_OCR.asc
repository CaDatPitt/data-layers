Town Meeting to Hear

News Guild Orgmlizer 
Speak On ‘Free Press’

Whipple to Give
Talk at Session
This Afternoon

Discussing “Freedom of the
Press” from the newspaper1nan’s
point of view, Charles L. VVhip-
ple, resident organizer for the

_.Ar_nerican Newspaper guild of

thePittsbur;_rl1 area, will speak
at today’s Pitt Town meeting.
As ‘usual, students and faculty

members are invited by the YM-
YWCA Town. meeting committee to
attend the forum at 2:30 o’clock in
244 Cathedral.

Whipple, a graduate of Harvard
university, and former re—write
man for the Boston Globe, was for
several years a member of the ex-
ecutive board of the Boston division
of the newspaper guild before com-
ing to Pittsburgh as resident or-
ganizer for the guild. He was also
secretary of the guild in Boston.

pWhi.le at Harvard, Whipple‘ ma-
jored in history and economics,
graduating in 1935. He also was
a student for a year in the Harvard
law school.

Committee members expect Whip-
p1e’s talk to be vital, due to cur-
rent charges by the certain groups
that the government is attempting
censorship or control of news be-
cause of the national defense pro-
gram. Recently, the government
news agencies were ordered to ex-
pand, causing a request for addi-
tional congressional appropriations,

,but it has been denied this was an
. attempt [by the government to es-

tablish censorship, according to

_ several articles in_the newspapers ’

recently- , A.

"Besides expansion of thebureau
at,Washingt_on and expansion of its
stations in: key cities of the country,
the Army and Navy are organizing
publicity departments to control re-
lease of their news. a ’

Presents, Allison

Everything happens to him!

William F. Allison, Pitt gradu-
ate and publicity director of the
Buhl planetarium since 1939, was
all set to leave for Camp Meade
last Friday.

His friends gave farewell par-
ties. They gave him army gloves,
a ﬁtted case, woolen socks. He

sublet his house and got rid of a
2 - months - old automobile. His
wife. Adele Moyer, formerly of Pitt
and now society editor of the Pitts-
burgh Press, went back to live
with her mother.

And then a last minute examin-
ation showed that he had ﬂat feet
and can’t go.

-announces Howard Schwartz, C41,

According to Schwartz, who per-
sonally inspected the laboratories
last Friday, the safety regulations
there, if followed, would not per-
mit even the slightest accident.

f‘Ai.though’ most of the students
follow the regulations,” stated
Schwartz, “I saw a few that were
not _wearing the goggles that are
provided for them while they con-
duct dangerous experiments. I saw

, Dr. Alexander Silverman, head of

the chemistry department, and he
assurecl me that the necessary steps
would be taken to see that every
student will wear the goggles when
necessary. Also, the question of stu-
dent using test tube holders, to pre-
vent hand-burns,’ will be looked
into.”

Elliot Paints Mural Decoration“
In Lithuanian Nationality Room

. By ANITA PAT BARONE

Decorating a wall of the recently
dedicated Lithuanian room is a
mural decoration executed by Philip
C. Elliot, assistant professor of ﬁne
arts.

The mural, a copy of a painting
by Mykolas Konstantin Ciurlionis,
representative Lithuanian artist, is
typical of the ideals and art of
Lithuania.

The original painting was called
“The Two Kings” and hangs in the
Ciurlionis Art gallery at Kaunas.

In the mural are the trees of the
Lithuanian forests, which cover a
moody background, representing
the dark and uncertain past of
Lithuania and the oppression by
Russia. Among the branches of the
trees are ﬂickering stars represent-
ing points of bright hope for the
future. Silhouettcd against this un-
certain background are two kings.
One king holds in his hand some-
thing very bright. a jewel, which
the other king guards with his
sword. The jewel which the king
holds is a Lithuanian village‘ with

its typical thatched cottages, white
birches and poplars. It stands for
the most precious possession of
Lithuania.

The painting is luminous because
of the bright light of the stars and
the jewel-like quality of the vil-
lage.

The painting of Ciurlionis is of
three kinds: philosophical, inter-
pretations of musical themes, and
the expression of some nationalistic
theme. “The Two Kings” falls into
the group of nationalistic themes.

Ciurlionis was a philosopher as
well as an artist. He believed the
future of Lithuania was in the land
and the simple country people. He
lived and died before the First
\Vo;‘ld war.

Elliot faithfully produced the
painting on the wall in the room in
true fresco technique. It repre-
sents 15 days work over a 5 months
period. This is the second mural
Elliot has done in the Cathedral.
The first mural was done for the
wall of the elevator lobby in the
Retail Training bureau.

Student Club ids
Syrian Committee

In Plan for Room

Aid in the completion of the
Syria-Lebanon nationality room is
one of the principal aims of the

Syria Intercollegiate club, an or-
ganization of students of Syrian de-
scent who have recently organized.

Aims of the group stated in the
preamble of the club’s constitution
are as follows: “To bring ourselves
into more mutual relationship and
to coordinate our rich heritage of
ideals and institutions with the
American Way of life.”

Hoping that their organization
will be the nucleus of similar organ-
izations on other campuses, they
have already made contacts at Du-
quesne, Carnegie Tech, PCW, and
Mount Mercy.

In addition to work on the na-
tionality room, they have planned
social events, a scholarship fund.
and a program of speakers for each
meeting.

Temporary officers include Robert
Shahade, C42, president; Evelyn
Corey. C41, secretary-treasurer; and
George Joseph, L42, chairman of
constitution. The next meeting of
the club will take place Monday at
12:30 o'clock in 129 Cathedral.

Alumni Council Meets;
For W'hat - - - - ?

ALUMNI COUNCIL meets tonight.

In some schools this might be an announce-
ment of importance, but at the University it
will cause scarcely more than a ripple of in-
terest.

We mention this only because we think the
Alumni association has gone on long enough not
doing anything. While it is possible that one
or two actions of import may be taken tonight.
we doubt Whether any constructive moves will
be made, further adding to the association’s long
line of meaningless palaver.

As every student of the University knows,
there is little constructive work that can be done
without money, and we realize that the Alumni
association is quite low on funds. The reason
expressed by some of the more vociferous mem-
bers is that the University has withdrawn its
subsidy of the group.

This is undoubtedly true. But why should
such a subsidy be necessary for the organization
to exist? We know of few other large schools
in which the alumni association is not self-sup-
porting. Furthermore, we should like to ask
what the Pitt organization has done to deserve
such a subsidy. In recent years, at least, their
attitude has been one of continual criticism of
University policy, and not always intelligent
criticism.

We do not mean to imply that all University
alumni do nothing but complain. The members
of the association include only a small percent-
age of all Pitt alumni, and we are positive that
there are a great many University alumni sin-
cerely interested in their school’s welfare.

Admittedly, there have been instances in
which University administrators have not given
Alumni association members and ofﬁcials all
the cooperation they might have, but the gen-
eral attitude of the group has not been one which
would make cooperation likely. The Alumni
association has yet to show that it can stand on
its own feet and command the respect of every-
one.
We see a deﬁnite need in any school. but
particularly in a large one, for a smooth-func-
tioning alumni organization. We think such is
possible at the University. Some day, we hope
to see our belief substantiated. But until the
time when Pitt alumni can unite for some com-
mon purpose, some plan which will give back
to the University at least a portion of what the
University gave to them, we can see little of
real value in the Alumni association.

Current Comments

The Same Old System,
Or I s This War Aimed?

The nature of modern wars has been characterized
in a recent text of the U. S. Army as “political, re-
ligious, dynastic: struggles for world supremacy, na-
tional and colonial conquest, wars of independence,
civil wars”; since 1919, “ideological wars”; and be-
ginning in 1939, “the renewal of struggle for world
supremacy.” Although the soldier dies just as grate-
ful for the chance to, etc., the Army has classﬁed the
“nature” of war in 1941 as something new. Without
seeing Red, it is difficult to disagree with the diagnosis.

This super-simpliﬁcation too easily discards the most
potent force in world affairs since 1648: the modern
European States System. In the absence of any super-
state, a balance of power has continuously been main-
tained among the states of Europe. This balance-of-
power principle is being too easily dropped in the face
of uncertain “psychological-ideological" explanations.
The European System has worked for 300 years. It
has not suddenly disappeared under the pressure of
ideological warfare. National self-interest is still the
guiding light.

Ideological War

International ideological wa.r has been a flop in
coalescing nations into “f.ront.s..” as Union Now advo-
cates wish-think. The balance of power interests show
up under camouﬂage: Germany-Italy-Japan vs. Eng-
land-France-U. S.; Russia on the fulcrum; satellite
states tossed about with frivolity. And the troubler in
the system reappeared in 1939 as in all former wars:
the Disturber, the assaulter of the System, the one
government, or people, or leader, who became arro-
gant and ambitious, and formed designs to extend their
State by force.

Analytic Disillusion
, Nothing is ‘ so disillusioning as reading Professor
Mowat’s un-ideological analysis of the British view-
point, written just after the last war, (I take the lib-
erty of suggesting parallels): “Undoubtedly European
domination by one Power means Europe in fetters.
This was the idea behind the persistent opposition of
England to Napoleon (Hitler). The Napoleonic (Nazi)
Continental System was itself a gigantic, carefully
thought-out scheme for the enslavement of Europe.

“By the Decree which Napoleon (Hitler) issued
from Berlin (sic) no trade was to be allowed between
Great Britain and Europe. Every continental state ex-
cept Turkey (sic) was considered to be an ally of
France (Germany) . . . In the end the System broke
down: it was impossible for Napoleon (Hitler) to stop
all the gaps by which trade could be carried on with
the British Empire . . . The steady refusal of England
to recognize the Napoleonic (Nazi) Empire, her in-
ﬂexible policy of war against it, were the work of Wil-
liam Pitt (Winston Churchill) and his school of states-
men. Pitt had the vision and the will to save the
European System.”

What more does Churchill stand for?—Jay Edgar.

belated (praise. &

This is music which should satis-
fy almost every kind of music lover
from the serious classicist down—-
or up—to the swing fan.

Best of the recordings, in our es-
timation, is “Rhapsody in Blue,”
presenting the principal theme of
the George Gershwin masterwork.
Gershwin also gets another side de-
voted to three of his songs from
“Porgy and Bess.”

In contrast to these are the faster-
tempoed “Anything Goes” and “Lou-
isiana Hayride.” They’re both play-
ed with remarkable freedom, con-
sidering the tremendous size of the
organization.

0 Don’t Forget .

Oh yes, we must not forget Duke
Ellington’s “Mood Indigo.” A lot of
people who’ve heard the album
pick this as their favorite, and
we can hardly criticize their choice.
This is played in a subdued quiet
way as “Mood Indigo” should be

played. In short, everything is in
good taste.
There's a bit of South American

tempo, too, for Rodriquez’s “La
Camparsita” comes in for a bit of
a rendition. Others in the album
include “Night and Day,” “Lady of
the Evening,” “Beautiful Ohio,”
“When Day is Done,” “Among My
Souvenirs,” and “Moonlight and
Roses.” The old tunes are still
solid enough stuff to stand the test
of the years, proving our contention
that a stiff-spined melody is time-
less.

 

The ritt liews

C By Grace .\1cComhs and Fred Robie
Our ball was over. Our eyes were tired, but we
still remembered. Time can’t erase the fun. the fac-
ulty guests, our fraternity friends, and a band that
played good music. The non-fraternity men and
women who sweated for their ﬁrst social event felt
successful. They had struggled in the ground ﬂoor
lobby, in the Tuckshops, on the street cars, and even
at home. to bring friends and their gals to the inaug-

ural dance. It's complete, and enthusiasm reigns su-

preme.
S‘ck: Jack Stauff missed the Big I-Ball, Satur-
day night. It seems piecing together cuts for next

week’s Pa.n9h-er became so fatiguing that our dear
ed’f.cr succumbed to the sand-bagging and lea.d-pick-
the of Mr. Inﬂuenza. instead of Mr. Ed Klein_ ticket
ﬁrchrand for the IA dance.

It was Bob Asti’s birthday; he told us. Last Wed-
nesday, Bob wrote on library slips and stuck them
around the ﬁfth ﬂoor delivery room stating in different
languages, “This is my birthday!” Some interesting
dividends included a rattle, a teething ring, and a duck
that rings a ,bell when you pull it across the ﬂoor.
But the prize gift were two lip-prints signed on a
card in lip stick from two of his more passionate
feminine friends. We want to work in the library (at
least half of us does).

Query: Are Dottie Stack and Joe Rodgers really
back together again or was that temporary separation,

a couple of weeks ago, just a. trial period to see if
they could do without each other?

They debated before Hulda Tu1ly’s mother's Wom-
an’s Club of Mount Oliver. Bob Sullivan and colleague
proposed a union of the nations of the western hem-
isphere which included, as Bob put it, a provision for
an agency like a gigantic “supermarket” for the hem-
isphere which would transact all the foreign trade.
When it was over, and Fred Roth and.Bi1l Banks had
attempted to refute without avail, a woman in the
audience asked Bob, “Where would you locate this
supermarket?” Afterwards, Bob began to wonder about
parking space, too.

Po-st-Gazette's “Shower of Gold” radio program for
Pittsburgh telephone exchanges called up -.1 Mrs. Robert
Machesney, last week, and. the next morning, our Bob
Machesney was greeted by at least a half-a-dozen
persons congratulating him on his marriage. Now,
we all know that Bob isn’t attached maritally to any

young lady, yet. But, these people wondered who
got the $25, and now we wonder, too.

. . . Fliekers . . .

Fulton

For quite some time man has been concocting mental images; auricular,
visual, abstract. In the past they were combined as operas, ballets, “plot”
scores. Recently the motion picture industry has combined them in various
qualities, cf. the “incidental” music of the recent sophisticated comedies.

But it remained for Leopold Stokowski’s Philadelphia orchestra, RCA
Fantasound, and a few classical composers, aided by the original mind and
versatile pen of Walt Disney, -to produce what has been truly called a
harmonious masterpiece of color and sound, FaNtAsIa.

From the symphonic warmup in the opening chorus to the closing
strains of Ave Maria, Disney has simpliﬁed the work of the composer: he
has put his “non-technical” ideas of what the author might have been
thinking onto the screen and lightened the burden of millions of people who
otherwise might have had to think those same images out for themselves.
In fact, at times he has succeeded so well that the music seems to be in-
cidental to the Disney animations.

Helped no end by the brilliant orchestral work of the Philadelphia,
acclaimed by many as the na:tion’s best orchestra, and by the new-type
sound equipment that ﬁlls a hall with “positioned tone” that makes you
feel the orchestraﬁisv actually there, Walt has produced another new success
that still boasts momentarily of the old principals Mickey Mouse, a reno-
vated Dopey, Cliothe ﬁsh. ]

The best of the Disney interpretations is probably his scenario for the
Beethoven Pastoral, the Symphony No. 6, which wins honors for its bril-
liancy and delicacy of color, its comedy and drama, its homelife and its
revels.

Tschaikowski’s Nutcracker suite is a close second, followed by the
“scientiﬁc” version of the world’s beginnings, set to Igor Stravinsky’s Rite

of Spring. (The thirst scenes in the latter were so realistic that Disney
could well claim a percentage on the drinks sold in the immediately-foL
lowing intermission.)

Having made his start as a humorist, Disney still has his last laugh in
FaNtAsIa, as, abetted by tongue-in-cheek commentator Deems Taylor, he
personiﬁes the sound track, upsets a chime-rack, introduces Mickey to
digniﬁed Stokowsky, and starts a minor jam session.

All in all, FaNtAsIa is a worthwhile “picture.” If you’re blind, the
music alone is worth your while; if you’re deaf, the screen will suffice; if
you’re half satisﬁable, your senses will be satiated.—ESK.

Stanley

Raymond Scott and his orchestra give out with the music that’s
different. _ - .

Composer-arranger Scott specializes in giving unique arrangements of
“Star Dust” and “St. Louis Blues.” He gets a delightful effect of yip-yip
in his composition “Dance of the Wooden Indians,” delightful when not
brassy.

The famed Raymond Scott quintet was nowhere to be found, but ﬁve
men in the band looked an awful lot like them. And there’s an electric
guitar which he features that’s mean with the hot riffs-—if a guitar can riﬁ.

The rest of the stage show was novel too: expressive tap dancing, dogs
and monkeys, featured vocalists, etc.

How was the picture? You mean “Footstu.-ps in the Dark?”
Errol Flynn and Brenda Marshall? It’s there too.—CFC.

  o o by Kal Kalwary

All the ideas set forth here are borrowed. They
are, in main, the basis for a reconstruction program in
a nation on the other side of the Atlantic, prepared
by a group of men and women, authorities in economics,
social science, architecture, coal mining, medicine,
agriculture, education, ad inﬁnitum.

Whenthe European war is over, they would like
to make their country a better placein which to live.
They propose to do this by scientiﬁc planning.

The planners would establish a system of economics
and government that would make certain a job for
every able-bodied man, willing to work. They would
institute a State control of banks and individual in-
vestment and a State-managed company to make com-
munity investments. Income tax for all would be re-
duced.

Social security services would be overhauled, with
a guaranteed national minimum——a standard below
which no one should be allowed to fall, in employ-
ment or out, in sickness or in health, during widow-
hood or in old age. There would be an all-in con-
tributory scheme of social insurance and special forms
of help from public assistance. The State would pay
regular allowances to children in the form of coupons

which would be exchanged for milk and other foods C

essential for children, and for children’s footwear and
clothing.

Get Rid of Slums

All housing would be planned with the housewife
in mind. New municipal services would be inaugurated:
municipal hot water, scientiﬁc refuse disposal, muni-
cipal laundry service. 2

A commission to apportion the land for the various
needs of the community would be founded. This com-
mission would encourage a revival of the soil, equip
the land with modern workers by awarding land to
men of approved experience.

Everybody would receive the same kind of educa-
tion up to the age of 13. The child’s future education
would be decided at this age. A rigid system of
academic secondary education for all—with social
prejudice kept out-——would be made certain by law. A
thorough reconsideration. of University curricula would
emerge from the new system. e.g. The pharmacy
student would be taught how to read and write and
think maturely; also the engineering student, dental
student, and accounting student.

State Health Control

The Department of Public Health would set and
demand a high health standard and make public health
a positive service. Child welfare centers would be
built in every community.

A State medical service, with full beneﬁt of medi-
cal science available to everybody, would at long last
be realized. The members of the medical fraternity
would no longer be preserved by a small body of the
well-to-do as a monument to private practice. The
doctor, along with the teacher and architect, would be
a public servant.

Real holidays and real leisure time for all would be
the rule. Facilities for the study and appreciation of
the Arts would be created to serve all, and even a de-
partment store clerk would be allowed time to make
the acquaintance of Whitman, dab in ceramics, collect
butterﬂies, go ﬁshing or attend the theatre.

The people who put these ideas into a minutely
detailed plan are not just dreamers, they aren’t mad,
they aren’t trying to outsmart the next fellow in a
business deal, they aren’t even running for political
oﬁﬁces. They’re wholeheartedly striving for a more
reasonable way of living with the rest of the world.
You see, they want their plan related to an interna-
tional plan.

It seems intelligent and decent, doesn’t it? It
might bear study by a nation on this side of the At-
lantic.

7/ze Pad-Wm ﬂqeleu: a S/sou‘ 

He is one of those who just missed
‘being a war-baby. Some twenty-

one years ago, he blinked at the
silver nitrate and opened his eyes
onto a world that was just getting

*over the revelry of armistice, a

world sad and squint-eyed, like a
sobering drunk. '

He started to grow in the days of
ﬂappers, ear-phone radios, and the
big railroad strike. When he was
six‘, they shipped him off to the
public school to see the calco-
mined. perfectly-ﬂourished alpha-
bet stretching across the top border
of three blackboard panels. That
way the little ones could look up-
wards and learn to revere the let-
ters.

(Twenty-six lead soldiers of dem-
ocracy standing guard over the ram-
parts of liberal thought,)

At the end of his ﬁrst term, he
skipped a half-year, and again at
the end of his second term. Then
the principal called him and his
mother in, and they were in the
office a long time. They decided
that they would not skip him any
more, and he guessed that was all
right.
tiger tiger

Through the earlier part of his
life, he grew to discard the in-
pounded principles of his religion,
and in their place to set up for him-
self an almost as blind faith in the
powers of science, in the clover-
leafed cities of H. G. Wells and in
his gloating over the outdatedness
of Jules Verne’s fantasies (exclu-
sive of the rocket-ship to the moon,
which was being worked on any-
way out in California and which
would be ready for release any day
now); above all he dreamed for
himself a child-belief in the Gen-
eral Science which could make man
fly and which could dissolve all of
the world’s chemicals and get a
trillion miles on a gallon of ra-
dium.

(The world was through with war,
and especially so was the melting-

Through it all there was Science,
liberal and dynamic, knowing all
the answers, all of them. (He read
Amazing stories and Buck Rodgers;
from these be conceived an atom-
disintegration machine whereby
people could be taken apart in New
York and re-assembled in Tibet in
0 time.)

Then there was the depression
and the depression years. Just
around the corner, an apple for a
nickel, Mr. Van der Pierpoindexter
has to get in line just like the rest
of us for his bowl of soup.

Just around the corner

There’s a rainbow in the sky,

So let’s have another cup of

coﬁee,

And, let’s have another piece of

pie.

People listened to the radio. They
circled their chairs around the big-
spindle—legged boxes, shoulders

forward, listening‘ to voices, just
voices. (“The written word will
some day become extinct. Man will
become more and more ear-consci-
ous. As he does so, the muscles of
his eyes will atrophy and go the
way of the vermiform appendix.”)

He began to ‘feel "himself" grow.
At the end of his ﬁfteenth year he
could reach to the lower edge of
the transom. That summer he went
to work in the baseball park, lift-
ing a bucket of soda pop, ice, and
water, and watching the ball
games.

The next summer, he sold pants
in a pants store. “Always pull the
pants out of the pile when you show
them to the customer,” the boss
would say. “A pair of pants mixed
up in a pile like that don’t mean a
thing. You got to get it out by it-
self.”

When he got out of high school,
he went to work in a factory. Ten
dollars a week for the ﬁrst few
years, membership in the union as
soon as you make eleven. There
were too many things that had to
be done by hand. It was unscien-
tiﬁc and he quit at the end of the
summer.

He registered at the University in
September of that same year. They
found a course for him. This is the
General Expansive Over-All Hyper-
aesthetic Culture-Culture course,
they said. In it you will be broad-
ened, heightened, and uplifted.

In his freshman year he wa.lked
around the halls, looking for a
friend. All this while he was be-
ing broadened, heightened, and up-
lifted.

Th head of the “department gave
him an A in English, so he decided
to become a writer. He wrote easily
and smoothly, with a rhythm to his
sentences. However, his sense of
structure was weak. Nevertheless,
he did write well.

He wrc-te through his sophomore
and junior years. He sent away
four stories and got excellent rejec-

tion slips. He had the four most
encouraging rejection slips in the
world.

He decided to become an extre-
vert. He drank beer,.and smoked
cigarettes, and made people laugh.
Making people laugh is the hardest
job any man can undertake.

He wrote about the proletariat.
These were the only real people.
They laughed louder, and fought
harder than any class of people in
the world. That includes the bo-
hemian and the Armenian.

Democracy was too undynamic
to invent a new name, so they called
it World War Two. During the ﬁrst
few months all the newspapers had
cartoons about soldiers sitting on
the Maginot and Siegfried lines and
throwing cream puffs at each other.

Then everybody wrote magazine
articles on why France fell (an au-
thoritative war document revealing
for the ﬁrst time the inner corrupt-

ness of the spy-ridden French gov-
ernment.)

The word-makers came out of
their hiding-places. (An airmada

Wales). , Should we call it a con-

Trio of Teams
Bowl for Title

This Afternoon

Today at 4:30 the Phi Kaps, PIKA,
and the Pilam keglers battle for the
intramural bowling championship
in the long awaited play-offs on the
University Center alleys.

A new system, which is believed
to be infallible, has been planned
for these championship games, in
which all three teams will bowl at
one time on three separate alleys.

Each"team moves from alley ta
alley as in two team bowling match-
es, until one team has won two
games. The ﬁrst team to win two
matches is crowned champion, and
the next team to win two is given
second place.

Bowling for the Pilam team,
which as a unit broke the previous
ﬁve man team record with an 823
game, are Bert Englesburg, Lenny
Wolk, Al Davidson, and Hershy
Ma»'CteS- Either Larry Katz or Mar-
ty Faberman will have to take the
place of Al Gross, who is at the
ODK convention.

The Phi Kaps, by their remark-
able second-half come-back, were
able to tie the leaders and take a
place in the play-offs. Led by Jack
Glenn, one of the best bowlers in
the circuit, their squad includes Bob
Tyberski, Ray Proshnok, Tom Mur-
phy, and Joe Connell.

Last year’s champions, who are
the underdogs this year due to the
loss of Hank De Rocher, are the
PiKA keglers. The Bellﬁeld boys
making up this team are Abe Wil-

liams, Lloyd Carlson, Chuck Page,

Jim Klingensmith, and Dick Fair.

WAA Rowling
Plans Changed

Three Tournaments

Replace Round Robin

Deﬁnite plans have been made
concerning the WAA bowling tour-
ament which will oﬁicially open in
two weeks. Instead of the original
plans whereby the student body
would participate as a whole, three
tournaments will be run at once;
one for the fraternities, one for the
independents, and one for physical
education majors.

Members of each of these groups
will be contacted by a chairman
appointed by the co—chairmano1'
the committee, Ruth Mendoza, C43,
and Harriet Harris, Ed42. Regular
practice hours have been scheduled
for each group at the University
Recreation on Craig street. The
special student rates which have
been procured for the students of
the University will apply at these
hours.

Each fraternity on campus has
been asked to form a team. No
deﬁnite number of players has been
speciﬁed, as the ﬁve highest scores
will be those counted toward the
tournament. Therefore, the team
with the greatest number of mem-
bers will have a greater number of
scores to choose from, enhancing
its chances of winning.

After the three tournaments have
been completed, a play-off among
the winners of the tournament will
be held, establishing the Univer-
sity champion.

Since many girls have not had an
opportunity to get in trim for the
tournament, the next two weeks
will be set aside for practice. Tues-
day afternoons have been reserved
at the bowling alleys for WAA.

All students who wish to take
part in the tournament and have
not received a card entitling them
to one free game each day and the
special student rate of 10 cents per
game, may obtain one of these cards
from the Physical Education ofﬁce,
or from either of the chairmen.

A. T. Colwell . . .

national president of the Society of
American Engineers, has chosen
“Behind the.Scenes in National De-
fense Engineering” as the topic of
a talk to be given at 8 o’clock to-

‘Bowser Faces Problem of Filling
Vacancies Created by Gradnationf

val BY ALEX ZELENSKI

Practice ﬁeld blues begin at 4:30 o'clock today wlien tfoach
(‘liar-les Bowser will ot"ﬁc1all_\' open his animal spring rebuilding

canipaign.

l*‘aci11g a suicide schedule with only four ﬁrst team lettermen
‘back from last _\'ear’s eleven, Coach Bowser has probably his hardest

test before him.

Weather will again be the ﬁrst
hurdle to overcome. Last year’s
spring months gave the Pitt coach-
ing staff little chance to take the
large squad outdoors; consequent-
ly, work in the fall was intense.

Hoping to avoid this conﬁict in
the fall is the wish of the coaches,
but, unfortunately, the weather-
man has the say.

Edgar “Mailman” Jones, Stan
Gervelis, Steve Sinco, and Ralph
Fife are the only holdovers from
the varsity team. Fife, at the pres-

ent time, is ineligible because of I

scholastic difﬁculties, and will not
report at the opening sessions.

Weakness at End

The ﬁlling of the vacancies left .

by the four senior ends will be
the sorest spot on the team. Joe
Rettinger, Earl Pressel, Johnny
Stahl, and Jack Goodridge will not
see action next fall, leaving only
Gervelis.

End coach Bill Daddio must rely
solely on the ability of a member
of the freshman or junior varsity
team to come along fast enough to
take charge of the right end posi-
tion. This post may be a deﬁnite
weakness all season, for there will
be few capable reserves.

The backﬁeld, under coaches
Greene and Stebbins, will need
quite a bit of ﬁlling in before Pitt
meets Purdue in the opening game.
Jones to Carry Burden

Sekela, Kracum, and Thurbon

will be missed, but freshman team I

members should carry the burden
adequately, although lacking in ex-
perience.

Walt West should be named num-
ber one man for the signal calling
post, with Tom Murphy close be-
hind. West, with one year of var-
sity competitionl past, should be one
of the standout performers on the
team.

Halfbacks are scarce this spring,
but Jones will be back. Edgar, in
his last year for the University,
should prove to be the great player
that was predicted of him early in
his freshman year.

Bill Dutton and Jack Stetler will
have to ﬁght for the other half-
back post, but regardless of which
wins the berth, an adequate sub-
stitute is assured.

Kracum Missed

All-American George Kracum
will not be back next season, and
the hole he leaves in the lineup
seems to be unﬁllable. John Ross,
senior from Ellsworth, Joe Connell,
and Bob Malloy will battle for the
job.

Malloy played with the junior
varsity team last fall, and was the
spark that led them to victories in
several tilts.

Centers will be plentiful around
the practice ﬁeld this spring. Steve
Sinco, burly line backer, will deﬁ-
nitely bolster the front line. His
blocking and defensive play of last
year should be enough to stamp
him as one of the outstanding men
on the team.

Jamison Speaks Today
On Mathematics Topic

Free Jamison, lecturer in mathe-
ematics at evening classes of the
University and in the Pittsburgh
public schools, will present a paper
before the Mathematics colloquium
this afternoon at 3:30 o’clock in 242
Cathedral, announces Dr. J. C.
Knipp, chairman of the Colloquium.

Jamison’s paper, “Quartic Sur-
‘ace Invariant under the Quater-
nary Collineation Group of Order
168,” will be of special interest to
advanced students in mathematics
and to all faculty members and
mathematics students, says Dr.
Knipp.

Trackers Seek
Indoor Marks

Panthers Jeopardize
Several Old Records

For the ninth consecutive year,
Pitt freshman and varsity track
men will make an assault on the
Pitt indoor track house records
Wednesday afternoon at 4 o’clock.
No admission will be charged to see
the talented spike-wearers perform.

Each year the task gets increas-
ingly difficult, for the stars who
have worn Blue and Gold track
gear the past decade have always
rated with the best in the nation.

Consequently, they have pushed the
records to the place where it is
well nigh impossible to break them.

To be sure, some of the times
don’t compare with University out-
door ﬁgures, but they can’t under-
go much improvement in the con-
ﬁnes of that wooden structure be-
hind the metallurgical laboratories.

However, there are still some po-
tential record shatterers on both
freshman. and varsity teams. Most
likely to replace old ﬁgures are
juniors Dusty Rhoades and Red
Jessup, who have hovered around
the 13 and a half foot mark all
season. Cy Pelucha, the present
crown bearer, set his mark of 12
feet nine inches back in 1935.

One mark that seemed likely to
stand for a long time looms very
dangerously near the breaking
point; that one is immortal John
Woodruf‘f’s half-mile standard of
2:00.3. Senior Del Anderson is
shooting for that mark, but it will
be almost a herculean task. On
another indoor track, Dartmouth’s
famous oval, Long John ran a
l:47.7 880. Del’s best indoor time
is 1256.5.

Walt Sterner, senior two. miler,
will also attempt a new mark, hav-
ing already run 10 seconds faster
than Ken Wagenhouser’s present
ﬁgure of 9251.9. A surprise per-

Malarkey Takes Exams,
Gains Eligibility Rating

Carlson to Take Eleven Players to National
Cage Championships at Madison This Friday

Clair “Tay" Malarkey big. blond
.=.ophoniore with the sharp eye and
the glue-tipped ﬁngers, is back in
Panther uniform and will see ac-
tion against North Carolina at Mad-
ison, Wis, Friday night.

Tay ﬁdgi-ted in a chair in Doc
Carlson’s cfﬁce for ten minutes last
Friday. afternoon while Carlson
called Registrar J. G. Quick and
Dean Omar C. Held to ﬁnd out if
he had passed his physics exam and
was eligible to play. The answer
was yes. ,

It was a welcome relief for the
Panthers, faced with the prospect
of meeting two of the toughest teams
in the country on successive nights
without one of their most valuable
players.

Tourney of Champs

All three Pitt rivals in the NCAA
Eastern division playoffs are league
champions, Wisconsin in the West-
ern conference, North Carolina in
the Southern conference, and Dart-
mouth, for the fourth straight year,
in the Eastern Intercollegiate league.

And each outﬁt boasts of a great
leader. Gene Englund of Wiscon-
sin, the top center of the Big Ten
for two years, has been named as
most valuable player in the con-
ference. Gus Broberg of Dartmouth
scored 175 points to lead his league
in scoring. George Glamack of
North Carolina’s White Phantoms is
the most remarkable ball-player of
the three. Half-blind in one eye.
George is a brilliant shooter who
has registered as many as 45 points
in one game.

According to the draw made last
Thursday by Governor Bricker of
Ohio, Pitt will play the Phantoms
in the second game of the tourney
Friday night. Wisconsin and Dart-
mouth meet earlier in the evening,
with the two winners battling Sat-
urday night for the right to play
the Western division winner at Kan-
sas City a week later. Should they
lose the opener, and comparative
records say that they won’t, the
Panthers will play the other loser
in the ﬁrst game Saturdaay.

Carlson Optimistic

A breakdown of the North Caro-
lina record reveals a probable Pitt
victory in their ﬁrst test. Although
winning fourteen and losing only
one game in league competition,
Coach Lange’s passers dropped de-
cisions in four out of ﬁve non-con-
ference games. And-Duke, soundly
trounced by the Panthers, scored
the lone conference upset over the
Phantoms.

Doc Carlson, crown prince of the
optimists, expects his boys to knock
down North Carolina in the opener

University’s bigger defense.tra1ning
courses, production planning and

industrial

' control. which is conducted. along

with several other special defense

planning has an enrollment of over
200 in classes conducted’ on cam-

‘ pus__ in the Bayard street-Morewood

lege, he was industrial engineer

always‘ his ‘greatest concern, be-
lieving that Vrnere training isn’t
enough’. “I know this,” he stated,

.“because I ‘am a practical man,

having been in industry many years
before becoming a teacher.”

partment does have a good record
of placements, being built up

time,” he declared. ,

The Likes of Him

Monday, March 17, 1941

Marshall Amazed by Cathedral,

Foster Collection—-or Was He?

5‘ By Giioiiaiét snUs'x"r’

We liked Everett-~Marshal1 mainly because he liked Pitt.

We swear that the fact that he was broad-shouldered, good-looking,
and the star of “Blossom;.Time,” had nothing to do with it.

When the Massachusetm-born singer visited the University Thurs-

day afternoon, he was impressed-—
or maybe he was just polite.

At any rate, he seemed amazed at
the height of the Cathedral, and at
the Foster collection, and amused
by the Tuck shops, and by how
young-looking the students are.

An elevator operator stared at
the operatic star as we rode up to
the thirty-sixth ﬂoor of the build-
ing. Marshall ran his ﬁngers self-
consciously through his abundant
hair. “Have to.wear it so darn
long for this Shubert part, y’know,”
he explained.

He has an engaging way of
speaking, and a charming habit of
adding that .little “y’know” to al-
most every observation he makes.

The star spent about an hour
looking over the original letters
and scores by Stephen Foster. He
would pause before the glass—en-
cased pieces of music. and sudden-
ly he would start to hum “Old Dog
Tray” or “Old Folks at Home.”

Nice, homey, sort of a fellow.

We went into the music library
and he argued for several minutes
with an enthusiastic young guide
about whether Luther’s or Crooks’
voice is more suited to Foster’s
melodies.

Personally, we think Marshall is
‘prejudiced, Richard Crooks being a

‘ personal friend of his.

The singer has studiedextensive-
ly in Italy, France, England, and
has traveled over most of Europe.
He believes, as most stars of the
stage do, that a movie audience
can never provide the same kind
of stimulus as does a theater audi-
ence.

“You can act a part a dozen times,
and every time give aidifferent
performance. You have that direct
contact with your audience,
y’know,” he stated.

Anyway, we liked l\/Iarshall. He’s
nice. »

Hefs smooth.

Research Bureau
Reports Pittsburgh
Business Steady

Bureau of Business Research
states that the level of business ac-
tivity in the Pittsburgh district last
week was stationary. A gain in the
volume of shipments offset a slight
decrease in the adjusted indexes of
industrial production and trade.
These indexes have been holding
near the current level since about
the middle of January, and business
in the district has been above nor-
mal since early June 1940.

Steel mills in the district oper-
ated at practical capacity. The-
same schedules were in effect at
the beginning of the current week,
and no change was made in the
number of blast furnaces in opera-
tion. Electric power production in-
creased, but bituminous coal pro-
duction showed little change.
