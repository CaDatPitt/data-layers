llilementary Education

Must Inspire, Not Stifle  

by NICHOLAS DeFIGID
Chairman, Undergraduate
Curriculum Committee

(Editor's note: The develop-
ment of a new program in Elemen-
tary Education involves many
people. The faculty and students
must share the responsibility to
develop meaningful educational
experiences. Nick De Figio is
one of the people leading the pro-
cess of change. He, along with
other interested faculty, will
be talking with students on No-
vember 19th at 7:30 p.m. in the
Student Union Supper Room.)

It is no secret that the basic
foundation of the educational
processes in this country is in a
state of turmoil. All that you need
to do is visit a school and watch
the process at work. As you watch.

Veterans

Parade

>~ A Support

by BILL GORMLEY
Feature Editor

Pittsburghers turned out in
record numbers to view last Tues-
day’s Veterans Day parade. Lining
Fifth and Liberty Avenues in thick
columns, they observed the tradi-
tional display of military strength
and solidarity. The crowd. ap-
parently ‘enjoying the colorful
spectacle, cheered as soldiers,
veterans, musicians, local*digni-
taries, and pretty girls passed by.

Although the pomp and cere-
mony which have characterized
the parade for the past half-
century were little different from
that of previous years, one new
feature distinguished the march.
For the first time in local his-
tory. a fifth division followed the
normal contingent of troops
and legionnaires. The parades
caboose. which originally consis-
ted of 150 students. grew to in-
clude a few thousand people as
bystanders joined the ranks.

Themarchers. who assembled at
the Civic Arena and proceeded to
Point State Park for a rally. waved
flags and hoisted placards as they
walked. changing "Hey. Hey.
U. S. A.! Periodically. they flashed
the thumbs-up sign which sym-
bolizes support for America's
troops in Vietnam and President
N ixon’s policy on the war.

A group known as the
"Thumbs-Up Coaliton" conceived
the idea of the fifth division.
According to William Schmidt.
spokesman for the coalition and
professor of economics at Point
Park College. the twin purposes
of the fifth division were "to
give moral support to Americans
serving in Vietnam and to back
the Nixon administration in its
effort to bring about an honor-
able peace in the country."

you will be witness to a sad and
very unusual form of rebellion or
revolt. Children ages six through
twelve. who were once curious.
full of life. and eager to learn are
now passive and nearly turned-off
during the school day.

It is also no secret that the
teacher training institutions. not
only here but throughout the coun-
try. have been something less than
adequate in the training and de-
velopment of new teachers. Much
of the training that has been re-
ceived neglects the single most im-
portant factor in teaching — the
child. University students. for the
most part. have little if any ex-
perience with children before
their student teaching experience.
It has been assumed that with all
of the academic input received
prior to student teaching, once
combined and mixed thoroughly
during student teaching, produces
something called "teacher."
It matters little if this student
teacher has had prior experiences
with children. There will be
time enough for that when she
has her own classroom. How as-

mine to think that fifteen weeks_

can serve as both the refining
and -polishing. and the first true
experience with children.

Very recently the Elemen-

tary Education Department took
the first step toward a total re-

vision of its undergraduate cur-

liiUrban Affairs ‘iii

  Majors Seek   Support  

The city is increasingly be-

coming the major influence in

shaping the existence of all those
people who live or work in it.
The city is also becoming a ma-
jor influence in shaping the lives
of those who do not. As an en-
vironment which has such a great
effect on the substance and style
of life today, its study is manda-
tory if we are to comprehend and
then control the social forces
whose currents threaten the pos-
sibility of civilization itself.

Last year an urban affairs ma-
jor was created and approved by
the Undergraduate Council. How-
ever. no formal courses were of-
fered and no funds were appro-
priated. Some Interested faculty
members and students formed a
seminar for Fall 1969. The pur-
pose of this seminar‘ was to plan
an Urban Affairs major and de-
termine what courses should be
offered.

‘The seminar committee has
proposed to The College of Arts
and Sciences five courses to be
taught beginning in Fall. 1970.
The seminar committee has also

proposed that monies be made avail-

able for the necessary personnel.
faculty. and graduate assistants
to administer the programs and
teach the courses.

The five proposed courses are
as follows:

City Field Work Seminar (6
,credi,ts.);, P . - . i A‘

riculum.

This new program has as its
central theme. individualization.
Five task force groups have -been
organizedto study and recommend
an individualized format that
provides.» a wide variety of
courses. options. and experiences.
Many facets of the University
Community are presentiy in-
volved in helping us design a
forward-looking curriculum.

The Elementary Education Fac-
ulty recognizes the‘ awesomeness
task ahead. The students aspiring
to become teachers must also re-
cognize the awesomeness of the
task. As the program evolves,
students will be called upon to
analyze their own strengths and
weaknesses. Students will, as
never before, he called upon to
make decisions about their own
program of studies; about their
own personal experiences; and
above all, about their effectiven-
ness with children. Many have
expressed joy and relief with
the abolishment of the old pro

few have considered the many
ramifications of the new pro- g
gram as it will effect them per-3

sonally.

A basic characteristic of life;
today is its changing nature. It;
may well be that the only thing;
to be institutionalized is change. i

In this seminar. students
work in the field doing urban
research or participating in
community action either with an
agency or a community group.
Faculty will assist in place-
ment of students and help with
working out of research pro-
jects. Students will share in sem-
inar discussion of problems.

Urban Synthesis Seminar (Ideas
and Integrities; 3 credits)

This seminar assumes that in-
dividual students have experience
in previous urban courses or field

, work which may be synthesized
by looking at.a range of general)

problems and approaches of var-
ious ‘ disciplines. Current litera-
ture on general urban issues will
serve as a focus for each student
to put_ forth his ideas an expand
hisintegrities. ' V
Urban Case Study (3 credits) :

An analysis of one major ur-
ban area or system (e.g. Pitts-
burgh, New York, Megapolis, or
specific city comparisons). Stu-
dents will have a chance to chal-
lenge professionals working in the
area‘ through a series of lectures.
Prior to sessions with visitors,
meetings will deal with prepara-
tory reading and discussion. At
the end of the course, analyses
will be made of these perspec-
tives for the case study area.

SG President,‘ Scott Baum

by BOB BON N
Staff Writer

Changes are
Student Government.

In a Pitt News-interview, SG
president Scott Baum told of
several problems which have been
encountered with Student Gov-
ernment during his administra-
tion. In his opinion, there is
"too much bureaucracy, and the
body is not truly representative
of all students." Also, “the SG
Senate has no real power in mak-
ing decisions or enforcing them.”

from a cross-disciplinary approach:
education in the city, racism and .

ethnic groups, community pow-

er. quality and value problems of

urban life. Instruction will be
shared between graduate assis-
tants. P

Experimental Approaches to the
City (3 credits) 1

Students will play roles in an
entire community and political
structure which is simulated
with the aid of a computer. They
will see the effects of their own
decisions as the community
and political structure which is
simulated with the aid of 5 com-
puter. They will see the effects
of their own decisions as the com-
munity changes through time.

The acceptance of the pro-
gram on the part of the adminis-

P tration will be influenced great-

1y by the amount of student in-
terest generated in an urban af-
fairs major.

Interested students are invited
to visit the booth Wednesday on
the ground floor CL or Thurs-
day on the Fifth Avenue side of the

on Washington, See Stories on‘ page 5.)

  

And thus, according to Baum,
the way to solve these problems
is to integrate SG with the Faculty

Senate, since ‘,‘that’s where the ’

real power is.”

"It appears that the next SG
will consist of people elected
directly into the Faculty (Sen-
ate,” Baum predicted. This will
be an improvement over the
present system, according to
the President, since now stu-
dents can only make recom-
mendations to higher officials.
The Faculty Senate, on the other
hand, controls curriculumchanges
and many other matters pertinent

to student life. As members of the A

Faculty Senate, students will
have a vote in all important aca-
demic decisions. I I

With elections to the Faculty
Senate, the present SG Senate
will be dissolved. Baum maintain-
ed that, even now, there is-
nothing done by SG that cannot
be done better by other campus
organizations. Next year, problems
on new social rules, for example,
would be handled by MDC; com-
muter problems would be handled
by the Commuter Association, and
so forth.

When students have a problem

after the new system is adopted, '

they should take it to the organ-
ization involved. If ' their prob-
lem is not handled ‘by any
specific organization, such as the
recent security problems, a wat-
ered-down version of the SG
president (known as the Facili-
tator) could tell them where to
take their grievances. The office
of president would be

abolished.

Further details on this propos-
ed reorganization are not avail-
able at this time. However,
the reorganization will be dis-
cussed at the SG ‘meeting to-
night at 7:30 p.m. in 203 CF. The
student body is, as usual, wel-
come to attend.

This past week-end. the William
Pitt Debating Union (WPDU)
again made a good showing. this
time in two tournaments.

The first one. a varsity tourna-
ment. took place at St. Joseph‘s
College in Philadelphia. Pitt sent
two teams. Pat Burns and George
Hopson. both of Pittsburgh. and
Jack Kennedy of Pittsburgh and
Gene Stoker of Nashville. Tenn.
Pat Burns was named the Best Fe-
male Debator and the Best Deba-
tor. Kennedy and Stoker were_able
to compile a 6-2 record and quali-
fied for the octo-finals. They ad-
vanced through to the semi-finals
where they were beaten by a
George Washington University
team.

The second tournament was
held at St. Vincent College, La-
trobe. WPDU sent their novice
teams, Charles Camic and Vir-
ginia Cook and Nick DiMuria and
Albert Wynn. Both teams advanced
through the tournament undefeat-
ed. becoming the best novice team.

Next weekend will find WPDU C

debators at three tournaments.
John Strand and Jim Kearney will
be going along with Jack Kennedy
and Gene Stoker to Wake Forest
University, North Carolina. Ron

lniks on the overpass.

by PEGGY ALLEN
Staff Writer

Dedicated to the 3985 stu-
dents who. are being cheated out
of their education.)

With all the improvements and
changes going on around the Uni-
versity, it’s nice to know that some
things remain. Take the English
Department, for example. If
the present rate of expansion
continues, my own children, twen-
ty years from now, will be able
to enroll in Pittand study Eng-
lish under the same over—crowd-
ed and under-staffed condi-
tions as those which now exist.

Now, I’m not complaining or
anything like that. It’s just that.

Might Say
It Was Pride

by MICHAEL HARMON,
Grad, FAS

It was the eleventh hour, the
eleventh day, the eleventh
month. A piece of paper signed
this day fifty-one years ago end-
ed a war, but there was another
war, and another, and another,
and so the day now honors men, in-

V stead of a paper, and that can’t

help but be right. It was cold,
and cloudy, as, we stood at the
rear of the parade,‘ behind the
troops and bands, the pom-pom
girls and veterans, as all the Am-
erican flags proudly waved in
the November wind, and you
might say it was pride that brought
this motely group together, not
personal pride, but pride in some-
thing bigger than ourselves,
America.

Not many people were there,

I really, a hundred, a hundred and

fifty or son, clutching the thir-
teen-starred flags the Legion
man had handed out. We wait-
ed for the parade to start. Those
of us who had been in the mili-
tary were used to waiting. It
didn’t seem natural not to wait.
The girl beside me had para-
trooper wings on her sweater.
Were they hers, I asked, trying
to start a conversation. I too wore
them once, No, she said, they were

er brother’s, and he’ was dead,

wo months ago, a mortar shell,
and so the day was his, and she
would honor him and his «sacri-
fice in public this day. Pride
was hers, and one man’s death
diminishes us all, but free
man’s death for freedom increases
freedom’s value, and J_efferson’s
bloody rule holds true, oh well-
watered tree of liberty.

The bands ahead‘ began to
move, and walking chased the cold
from our feet as the banner-
anthem warmed our hearts. Then
there were the crowds, the-chant:
Hey, Hey, U.S.A.! Come on and

" join us! And they did, the silent

secretaries, the silent house-
wives, the silent students, the
silent veterans, the silent mass
silent no longer, swelling our
ranks ten, twenty, thirty times.

When we started, it was easy
to see the front and rear of our
little group — but halfway down
the avenue, that was not so easy,
and we raised our heads and
threw strong laughter to the peace-
Now I
knew what Sandberg meant, the
People, Yes!

The rally was anticlimax, yet
still the pride ,kept us warm,
kept us loving. Positive is
stronger than negative, America’s
strength is our strength, and we

1 are hers! Heads bowed, we pray-

ed; heads raised',' we sang, and
knew that Rig-ht has strength apart
from Might, or~what’s 21' Heaven
for? Fulfilled, we turned, and
smiling raised a thumb to thumb
upraised on other hands, and
pride and love together said:
AMERICA!

W hither

Respect?

as an English major, I was a lit-
tle upset to learn that I could
not register for any English
courses next term since all of the
courses, except for core courses,
were closed. It seems that there
just aren’t enough full-time fac-
ulty members to teach the num-
ber of courses needed in the Eng-
lish Department.

Like I said, I’m not complain-
ing — I understand that in a Uni-
versity this size, we can’t al-
ways have the education that we
pay for — but there are some peo-
ple who just can’t understand this.
One such example is Dr. James
D. Simmonds, Associate Profes-
sor of English. This man, it seems,
has no respect for tradition, and
no trust in his administra-
tion. Last March, for instance, he
published a very detailed and
thoroughly. researched report on
the conditions in the English
Department. He claimed that un-
less people begin to demand enough
money to hire the needed num-
ber of faculty members, the de-
partment would have to limit the
number of students taking Eng-
lish courses. Can you imagine
anyone in this university demand-
ing change? ‘

But, just to let you see how far
some people can go with this
“demanding change" bit. I’m
going to print some excerpt from
the report and from an interview
that I had with Dr. Simmonds.

"The English Department," com-

plained Dr. Simmonds,

"teaches more students than any
other FAS department in the uni-
versity, yet it is the most un-
derstaffed.”

"The number of students
taught: by the English Depart-
ment is equal to 57 per cent of
the number of full-time faculty
as just one of the Social Science
Departments. ’ ’

Then, apparently not realizing
that life can’t always be equal,
Dr. Simmonds compared the stu-
dent-teacher ratio of the Eng-
lish Department with that of
other departments at the Univer-
sity. The ratio of the German
Department (students; facilty) is
39:1, Hispanic is 40:1, Speech is
65:1. The English Department
of Penn State is 47:1, of the Uni-
versity of Indiana is 58:1. The
ratio in the English Department
at the University of Pittsburgh
is 153:1.

In order tocorrect the situation.
Dr. Simmonds went on, the Eng-
lish Department needs at least
80-90 full time faculty members
(it now has 31). "If we could
hire 8-10 people _a year. we
would achieve a reasonable ra-
tio within 7-9 years.”

Dr. Simmonds feels that be-
cause the English Department
makes a profit of $1.3 million a
year for the University, it has
the right to spend the $200 thous-
and a year that it would cost to
hire the new faculty members.
Personally, I think that he should
be thankful that the English De-
partment get the money it does
now.

Then, probably as some sort of
Communist trick, Simmonds at-
tempted to bring the people into
this problem. "We ourselves are
to blame," he stated. "The Eng-
lish Department has always been
the Cinderella department. We've
been exploited and allowed to go
to Hell so that other departments

can improve. But, we’ve never com-

plained nor refused to put us with
this.

“We’ve been Uncle Toms.” he
added, probably as some reference
to current civil rights problems.

Security Breakdown Still Posing

Threat To University Community

by JOHN CAVALUCHY

The first few weeks of the fall
term made many students aware _
of a very dangerous security gap
existing on the University Cam-
pus. Students became afraid to
walk the streets of Oakland at
night. Cries of inadequate secur-
ity prevailed throughout the Uni-
versity community. To placate
the disturbed students and their
parents. the University administra-
tion made commitments to im-
prove the size, quality and effec-
tiveness of the University Po-
lice Department as soon as pos-
sible. That was two and a half
months ago.

The administration agreed to
implement the changes that were
called for in a Student Govern-
ment resolution. These changes
included: The wage scale of the
campus policeman to be steadily
increased until it is at par with
the city policeman;

The University should take steps
to recruit a college trained‘crim-
inologist or psychologist to
either run the department or be a
ful--time consultant to the men;
the University should begin to
offer its backing to the Univer-
sity Police Department and its
men.

After a month had passed.
none of the changes that the Uni-
versity had agreed to had been
implemented. Only a minimal pay
increase of forty dollars per month,
was agreed to. bringing the start-
ing salary up to the bare subsis-
tence level of $5,400 per year.
This was far below what the Ad-
ministration had initially agreed
to when the pressure was on them.
As for the second point of the re-
solution, no steps have been taken
to recruit the psychologist or
criminologist to serve as a con-
sultant.

To see what kind of backing
the individual campus patrolmen
are receiving from their office
and the University administra-
tion, one need only to review the

incidents of the past two weeks. A
week ago Saturday. a drunk tried
to gain access to the Towers.
When he could not get through a
locked door leading into the
Towers. he pulled on the door so
hard that he sprung the heavy
metal door. Minutes later he

found his way into the Quad-

rangle. After he had hurled ob-
scenities at a few passer-bys, a
police officer approached him
and his friends asked for some
type of identification. All but the
one drunk presented their Uni-
versity identification cards and
were sent on their way. The
one. however, refused to show any
type of identification. After he
came belligerent with the two of-
ficers present they escorted him
to their office.

Soon". the two officers from

the patrol car arrived on the scene.

at which time the person became
extremely violent. After he struck
three of the officers. ripping shirts
and pants. scratching eyes, and
knocking officers down, the of-
ficers had to. as a last resort,
place him under arrest on charges

of resisting arrest, assaulting three

officers of the law, disorderly
conduct. and intoxication. When
the hearing came up the follow-
ing week, the officers were "ad-
vised” to drop all charges but in-
toxication and disorderly conduct,
both summary offenses.

It seems that our campus police-
men had picked on an adminis-
trative assistant. Although one of
the officers had to make a trip
to the hospital and another had his
glasses broken and clothes rip-
ped, the drunk only got his wrist
slapped and a five dollar fine
plus costs.

Last week, an even more bla-
tant disregard for their commit-
ment to the University com-
munity was realized. One of the
most effective campus police-
men found himself looking for
another job because, as his office
put it, “he had a bad attitude.”
This "had attidude” as his office

put. some other people term as the
"desire to do his job.“

His "bad attitude” started to
develop in late October. It was
at an open meeting that the police
had with the Director of the Phy-
sical Plant, Hunt Martin. who is
there immediate boss. This was
supposed to be a meeting for the
policemen to express their gripes
to the administration without fear
of reprisal.

This officer. being a rookie on
the force, did just that -— he ex-
pressed what all the men had
been saying in private. ‘What

he did not know, however. was’

that his staff sergeant had been
sitting in the back of the room
taking notes on what was said.
Since he had attended college
for three years, the officer con-
tinued to express his feelings to
hisoffice. The office claimed that
they wanted such dialogue to
exist between their men and them.
When this dialogue materialized,
however, as it did in this case,
the office took the expression as
an affront to its ability to ad-
ministrate. The officer suddenly
received a schedule change from
the Towers to Scaife Hall — some-
where where he can not do any
harm.1

An interesting note is that the
officer had been moved just
prior to the meeting, into the

Towers because they thought he.

was an officer capable of deal-
ing directly with students. Of-
ficers and students alike admit-
ted that he was one of the most
effective officers in the Towers.

When he expressed a dissat-
isfaction with the schedule change,
he was told that he was fired.
He was summarily dismissed from
the University Police Department
because he had enough guts to
stand up and be counted. No
Security Force can even hope to
be effective when they have the
threat of dismissal hanging over
their heads for advancing con-
structive criticism.

Exploitation At ‘Presby’

by GUS OIBERMAIR
Ass. Professor, Physics

(Editor's Note:) Dr. Gus Ober-
mair works at Presbyterian Uni-
versity Hospital and has been in-
volved in the attempt of Drug
Workers’ Union No. 1199 to or-
ganize the hospital workers.

Exploitation begins at home
Facts:

1. For about a month a drive
has been under way to organize
workers at Pittsburgh hospitals.
in particular at Presbyterian Uni-
versity Hospital. "Presby" is
strongly affiliated to the Uni-
versity: its medical staff consists
largely of Pitt Medical School
faculty. moreover, two Univer-
sity representatives, the Chancel-
lor and the Dean of the Medi-
cal School. are on its Board.of
Directors.

2. What is the situation of the
hospital workers: porters. maids.
nurse aides, dieticians etc? The
beginning wage has recently
reached the enormous height of
$1.75‘ an hour (that makes it
about $300 a month). promotion
and raise are slow: many workers
have ‘to work two jobs. 12-16
hours daily, to support their fam-
ilies. '

3. Local 1199. the union of hos-
pital workers. which has won rea-
sonable contracts in New York.
Charleston. S. C.’ Baltimore and

other cities, demands: a $100 per
week minimum wage, job train-
ing programs. free hospitaliza-
tion for workers and their fam-
ilies. a pension plan and other
specified benefits. The union em-
phasizes that hospital jobs are dif-
ferent from other jobs. the labor
struggle shouldnot be fought at
the patients‘ expense. walkouts
should be the last resort.

4. As soon as Local 1199 star-
ted its organizing campaign here.
Presby’s administration reacted
with hostility: the union represen-
tatives were banned from the
hospital. workers were warned by
their supervisors not to endanger
their jobs by participating in un-
ion activities. workers consider-
ed as group leaders were pressed
to take a stand against the union.
two administration letters were
mailed to the employees warning
them against the violence that
this union would bring to the
peaceful hospital.

In spite of all this. more and
more workershave come to un-
ion meetings. over 300 on Nov.
4. many more have signed up for
the union.

5. The administration also dis-
tributed a blue sheet. listing the
fringe benefits available for the
workers: apparently the first time
that such a list was given to the
workers. _ »

Questions:

1. What is more outdated, a
wage system that forces people
to work 16 hours daily, or a un-
ion which has the Nation’s pro-
gressive nonmilitant leaders:
Coretta King and Ralph Aber-
nathy, among its campaign lead-
ers?

- 2. Does the hospital really ex-
pect union officials who have been
thrown out of the hospital, to
come back for negotiations be-

fore a local negotiating committee ,

has been elected by the major-
ity of the workers?

3. Who guarantees that the
workers will actually obtain the
benefits about which the hospital
only last week — all of a sudden —
has ever even informed them?

4. Can this university which
has recently committed itself so
strongly to labor justice in the
Black Coalition struggle. afford
the repressive actions of the Presby
administration against Local 1199
(representing. by the way. mostly
Afro-American workers ) ?»

Students. employees and fac-
ulty of Pitt could use their in-
fluence in this university for the
fast. peaceful change of a shame-
ful situation — even if we all have
to pay something for it: another
increase of hospital costs.

Remember: ' Social
begins at home.

"’Pittsburgh” Marched Thursday

March Against Death Decries Viet Toll

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

Loaded into cars, packed into
busses and thumbing it on the
turnpike, an estimated 7,000
people, the “Pittsburgh contin-
gent,” tobk off for Washington
D. C. in a continuous pilgrimage
Thursday, Friday and Saturday
morning. The capitol was the
scene of a massive protest against
the war in Vietnam.

The city was swarming as early
as Wednesday night with shelter
less migrants, most of whom were
on the "right side of thirty.”
The marchers, numbering 40,000
strong by the initiation of the
Moratorium March, had converged
on Washington from as far west as
Kansas and as far south as Flori-
da.

New Mobe

The participants came to Wash-
ington hoping to be housed and
helped, legally, medically and
otherwise by the New Mobiliza-
tion Committee against the War
in Vietnam, “New Mobe.”

New Mobe had organized and
coordinated the three day pro-
test on November 13-15. The
committee was an offshoot of the
Moratorium Committee respon-
sible for the October 15 day of
mourning. ‘

The reason for the breakoff
was summed up by a New Mobe
committee member “The Mora-
torium Committee was too con-
servative. It was run by business
interests, in the community on
the whole. We wanted an“ organ-
ization based more on initiative
action,” she said.

Before the planned three day
program, the two groups coal-
esced with a nationwide Stu-
dent Mobilization Committee,
but New Mobe remained the let-
terhead.

The official point of view was
expressed by the Committee in
the early part of the month: “We
call ‘for this demonstration and
rally in Washington to stop the
war in Vietnam NOW, to bring
all our troops home immediately
and in one piece, to win free
speech and democratic rights for
GIS, to stop the repression and
free all political prisoners, to end
the draft, to end racism in all
America and colonialism in Wash-
ington, D.C.”

Although the March against
Death, organized state by state,
began its 4.2 mile trek at 5:45
p.m. Thursday, the Pennsylvania
contingent was not scheduled to
march until midnight. Prior to
the march, participants were re-

One of America's, Q, a_..t._,'.l

quested to register at one of the
new Mobe centers. the African
Methodist Episcopal church on
Mst.

African Methodist Episcopal

The A.M.E. church was the
clearing house for Pennsylvania,
New York, New Jersey and other
eastern based groups. It was a
mad house of activity. Hundreds
of marchers filled the relatively
small basement of the church;
student coordinators that had
spent 36 hours on their feet tried
to bring order into the chaos.

"No smoking,” they shouted over
the pandemonium. "Shuttle
busses for Arlington leaving in
five minutes.” The ladies’ room
"broke” and girls shared the
men’s room with the men.

Within the church, tables were
set up to provide information on
routes, policy and housing. Hous-
ing accommodations emerged as

A the biggest sigle problem that the

committee faced. All of the uni-
versities in the Washington area
with the exception of George
Washington responded with extra
dorm space for “vagrant mar-
chers.” Private citizens offer
ed their homes and apartments.
Movie theatres opened their doors"
all night and dog tired people
spent the night on the floor of
theatres lobbies.

Some marchers went all the
way into Virginia to find warmth
and shelter.

Food was another big problem.
New Mobe workers made fast
peanut butter sandwiches and-
served coffee to a constantly mill-
ing crowd, waiting to board shut-
tles for the Cemetery.

Plastered all over the room in
the church were signs which read
"Please donate $.25 if you can.”
The committee was in debt for
more than $100,000.

Shuttled to Arlington

The Pittsburgh-Pennsylvania
contingent arrived at Arlington
about 11 o’clock Thursday night
where they were processed through
a series of circul-like tents.

New Mobe workers explained
the March route and the philos-
ophy. The catch word was non-
violence. “Look, whether you like
it or not, we need the support of
the silent majority,” evaluated one
of the marshalls. "We can’t push
for peace through violence. It’ll
be a mockery." He was greeted
with playful cajolery from the
crowd.

_ In the last of the series of four

tents. the marchers picked up black

armbands. buttons and a one foot

Since it was after dark, the
groups carried lighted candles. .

It was bitterly cold Thurs-
day night and a relentless wind
‘extinguished the candles as fast
as the marchers could relight
them. The trek across the Mem-
orial Bridge was especially slow;
one student from Allegheny Col-
lege removed his armband and put
it around’ his head to keep his
freezing ears warm; a girl from
the University caught her hair
on fire attempting to keep her
candle lit.

Once over the bridge the end-
less line worked its way pas the
Lincoln Memorial and up
Pennsylvania Avenue.

Washington policemen were sta-
tioned all along the route, con-
centrated near the area of the
Presidents residence. If alert,
the President Nixon heard the
shouting voices of marchers cal-
ling out the names of “their”
war dead. ‘

The Wooden Caskets

Directed by student marshalls,
the marchers proceeded in their
death march past the Department
of Justice to the Capitol. There,

they symbolically doused their

candles and marched silently
away.

At the completion of the 211/2
hour march, ‘shuttles transported
tired marchers back to the
A.M.E. where they could warm
up and finalize housing arrange‘-
ments.

The March against Death con-
tinued for forty hours and approx-
imately 45,000 people registered
their protest to the death toll in
Vietnam. The March against
Death ended about the time that
the Mass March Saturday morning
began.

Mall Rally Masses Million

by ANNE.~DORN
Staff Writer

By 8 o’clock in the morning,
Washington D. C. streets were
already beginning to fill with
people on their way to the Satur-
day Mass March against the war,
reportedly the largest anti-war
demonstration that the nation
has witnessed.

The ever-growing crowd as-
sembled for the March at the Mall
on Constitution and 3rd Streets.
“Conservative” press estimates
placed the number of marchers
at 250,000. Most participants of
the march, however, some of
them experienced mass demonstra-
tors, reported at least a million.
One of the speakers at the rally
following the march announced
a count of a million and a half.

The Mass March was the cli-
max to two days of anti-war ac-
tivities, including the peaceful
Moratorium March against Death.
Some marchers had come straight
from the March Against Death,
which had finished only a few
hours before 9 a.m., the scheduled
time for the participants to as-
semble.

The amassing crowd at the Mall
was speckled with signs and pos-
ters proclaiming “Vietnam: Live
It Or Leave It,” “Gallup Poll:
Doves‘-55 per cent, Hawks-33
per cent, and an American flag
with a peace sign substituting
for the stars in the blue field.

Banners from clergy unions, high
schools, GI’s draft resistance
teachers, “silent Majority_ for
peace,” psychologists. and “grand-
mothers for peace“ bobbed above
the crowd.

Crows nest reports of what was
happening out on the streets and
near the sound truck came down

-from the people who had climbed

trees or another’s shoulders to
bet a better view.

The march began when the
twelve coffins filled with the names
of American casulities from
Vietnam and destroyed Viet-
namese villages were carried by
demonstrators to a solemn drum
roll. At the head of the procession
were Senator Eugene McCarthy.
Senator George McGovern. Mrs.
Martin Luther King. Jr., Dr. Ben-
jamin Spock.

McCarthy spoke briefly be-
fore the crowd stepped out into
the street. He praised the March
on Death and the Mass March
as a tribute to the over 40,000
Americans who had died in the
war, the 250,000 wounded, and the
2 million who had served.

The Senator criticized the draft
system. and stated that the pro-

posed change to draft only 19
year olds-was just as bad, since
it would place the burden of a
moral decision only on their
shoulders.

The statement that drew the
greatest approval of the crowd
was the statement most quoted
in the newspapers after the
March: “We will not see that the
President has the right to say
who are the Americans in this
country,” asserted McCarthy.
“I think we are better witnesses
to waht the people want than
53,000 telegrams.” (The tele-
grams had been sent to Presi-
dent Nixon in support of his war
policy.)

Then the people joined Mc-
Carthy and the others, and quietly
followed the coffins wreathed
with flowers down Pennsylvania
Avenue. All along the march route,
volunteer marshals stood should-
er to shoulder, forming a boundary
between the sidewalk and the
street.

Interspersed in the line of
marshals were Washington. po-
lice, some of whom smiled and
waved the peace sign to the mar-
chers. As one group of high
school students passed along the
route, they shouted “more pay
for cops.”

The over-all tone of the march
was peaceful. One example of
this was the crowd’s refusal to
pick up militant, semi-violent or
one—sided chants. As one sec-
tion of the march passed a sign
reading “Peace is in reality,
Support our President,” one mar-
cher souted out "fascist pig” and
the several of the others hushed
him.

Chants like “Ho, Ho, Ho Chi
Minh” were not voiced by the
great majority of protestors, and
died down quickly. Hands with
the V-formed peace sign shot up
when army helicopters flew over-
head, or when the procession pas-
sed a building where observers
gathered on rooftops to watch.

Marchers arrived at the Wash-
ington Monument Ellipse area
behind the White House about an
hour after they stepped off onto
the March route. (The route fol-
lowed Pennsylvania Avenue down
to one black from the White
House where bus blockades had
been set up for security, turned
left onto 15th street, and right up
to the Ellipse.)

Food ‘stations offering refresh-
ments for donations if one could
afford it, for free if one could
not, a stage area for speakers and
entertainers, and a huge loud-

speakers bordered the grounds.

With tongue in cheek humor, the

sponsoring New Mobilization
Committee had set up rest room
facilities labled “Johnny-on-
the spot.”

Some people sitting on blank-
ets some passing around wine, food
and cigarettes, some standing to
see the crowd that stretched lib
erally to the horizon: all waited in
anticipation that one Washing-
ton newspaper compared to the
wait before a big football game.
Instead of a football -game, how-
ever, this was the program that

was the finale for the Peace
"March.

The first vote to greet the
vast audience over the loudspeak-
er was Peter Yarrow of Peter,
Paul and Mary, oneof the groups
to sing that afternoon. At ap-

proximately 12:45 p.m., he introduc-

ed William Sloan Coffin, a Yale
chaplain once arrested for aiding
draft resisters. He opened the
mass meeting with a prayer to
rid the country of the “fear that
corrupts wisdom for the sake. of
power that makes us pledge all
to one race, but not to the hu-
man race.”

Dr. Benjamin Spock welcomed
the participants as “my chil-
dren all,” and introduced Julius
Hobson, “first elected official in
D.C.” Hobson referred to Wash-
ington, D. C. as the “only colony
in the U. S. a reference to the
absence of home rule.

Among the many speakers dur- ‘

ing the day, most notable
were Dick Gregory, Mrs. Martin
Luther King, Jr., Dave Delling-

of all members of the University
Committee on Friday at noon in
Room 221 LH, to discuss on going
piece activities in Pittsburgh. The
meeting will discuss ways to
reach the community in a concert-
ed peace effort, utilizing the
broadest possible base of stu-
dents, faculty and non-university
community people to discuss the
issue of war and peace, specifi-
cally related to Vietnam.

This will be a plenary and or-
ganizational meeting for all
kinds of activity that will re-
quire the active support of great
numbers of people. Various sug-
gestions as to the method of rea-
ching out to the city in a kind
of educational program have
already been suggested including.
canvasing, speaking to establish-
ed groups, media campaigns, com-
munity meetings and similar
approaches. More suggestions,
are, if course, welcomed.

Alice’s Restau rant

Offers Little "Except Alice”

by ELEANOR ADAMETS
Staff Writer

When Director Arthur Penn
planned the menu for Alice’s Res-
taurant, he should have included
more meat. Penn’s‘ newest film,
based on and named for Arlo Gu-
thrie's folksong. Alice’s Restau-
rant, suffers at times from mal-
nutrition. But although the fare is
poorly balanced. the portion dish-
ed out by Pat Quinn, who plays
Alice, makes the film well worth
seeing.

Miss Quinn's performance is
clearly the best feature of the mo-
vie. She handles the role of Alice,
the hippie Big Mama, with natural
sensitivity and charming vulgar-
ity when the role demands it.
Alice. an aging flower-child. and
her sometime husband. Ray. buy
a deconsecrated church in Mass-
achusetts and open a restaurant
for the benefit of their drifting hip-
pie friends, including folksinger
Arlo Guthrie.

Although the folksong Guthrie
wrote as a commercial for the res-
taurant is primarily an anti-war.
anti-establishment protest song.
the movie focuses more on Alice
and her hang-ups. sexual and
otherwise. -

Perhaps because Miss Quinn
portrays the character so well,
Alice is the center of the plot that
was invented to supplement the
words of the original folksong.
But, it is Pat Quinn's fine acting
that is admirable, and not the
weakly constructed plot.

Alice’s is, “A place where we
can be what we want to be at
last.” James Broderick, who
plays a strong supporting role as
Ray. tells Arlo and Alice. Unfor-
tunately, neither Director Penn
nor his characters are ever quite
sure they know what they want.
What the film does is tell us what
they don’t want.

The characters attempt to es-
cape from conventional American
society by creating an isolated
community. The film accordingly
ridicules most institutions held
sacred by society, ranging from
the family to the military-indus-
trial complex.

The scenes that follow the pro-
test theme of the original ballad
are genuinely funny. The dump
scene, when Guthrie is arrested
for littering and the scene of his
subsequent rejection at his draft
induction center, inject the same
folksy humor into the film that

coats the frightening reality of
protest in the folksong.

Guthrie, who portrays himself
and wanders through most of his
scenes looking slightly confused,
is .most. convincing in comic’
scenes. He both looks and acts the
part of the comic hero-victim.

But, as the artificial cloister of
the hippie community. begins to
crumble, so does the film. Intern-
al bickering and violence within
the “family” disintegrates the
group. Guthrie is one of the first
to admit you can’t find everything
you want at Alice’s, especially if
you don’t know what you want in
the first place.

One by one the characters de- ’

cide it's time to start looking else-
where for “their own thing.”

- The film’s basic weakness is its
abruptchange of direction. As the
community disperses in protest
of their own deficiencies, the val-
idity of their original rejection of
society is obscured. The aliena-
tion of the group becomes one
against their own values that have
not been successfully upheld.

"What more could we want?”
Ray demands at one of the last
community togetherness blasts.
No one -has an answer. Arthur
Penn apparently felt it simpler to
leave the question unanswered. It
was easier to concentrate on what
the characters did not want thaii
to try to define their motivations.

and Senator George McGovern.
Gregory sarcastically joked with

I the crowd. “If Nixon wants to

know how much effect you have
on American opinion, he should
place a long distance call to the
LBJ ranch and ask him,” he be-

_gan. “You’re strong enough to
wipe out poverty and do away with
the military-industrial com-
plex.”

“Mrs. Coretta King summed up
the consequences that the war has
had on the nation. She cited
a “disrupted economy,” strangled
programs for urban reconstruction,
an alienated generation, and a di-
vided nation.”

Young people now know, she
cried, that “they’re not being giv-
en the society they were promised
as a birthright. They will not
accept this inheritance of evil.”
She repeated the words of Pat-
rick Henry who stated “If this be
treason, make the most of it,”
and like Gregory received a stand-
ing ovation.

Dellinger evaluated the use of
violence by protesters. "the news
media thinks." he
that the anti-war movement is
violent. People sometime throw
rocks and break windows and that
does not build a democratic so-
ciety. But the government drops
six ton bombs, wipes out whole
towns and cities, and napalms

M-Day: Pittsburgh

by ELEANOR ADAMETS
Staff Writer

Anti-war protesters staged a
peaceful Moratorium Day vigil in
front of the Federal Building in
downtown Pittsburgh Saturday.

The demonstrators, numbering

less than 100 persons, were main-
ly students unable to join the mass
rallies held in Washington, D, C.,
over the weekend in opposition to
the Vietnamese War.

The group, organized largely
through the efforts of Ted Hard-
ing of the Friends Peace Center,
handed out anti-war leaflets to
passers-by and marched several
times around the building holding
high their homemade anti-war
signs.

A handful of pro-Nixon support-
ers, led by a Marine home on leave
from Vietnam, staged their own
protest to the opposition to the
war. Standing only a few feet away
from the anti-war demonstrators,
the Nixon supporters also braved
the freezing temperatures in their
day-long effort to show visible sup-
port for President Nixon’s war
policies.

The proximity of the two oppos-

- ing groups underscored the nation-

wide diversity of opinion concern-
ing the controversial war in Viet-
nam.

¢The Nixon supporters, urging
passers-by to “Show their Col-

. ors” and their patriotism, wore

red, white and blue arm bands,
carried flags and gave away ‘small
flag-colored ribbons.

One woman anti-war protestor
waved her flag back at the Nixon
people as she marched around the
building.

“They have no monopoly on the
flag or on patriotism,” she said.
“I feel I’m more patriotic than
they are.”

Another war protestor, 73-year-
old John Weaver, wore his “Vets
for Peace in Vietnam“ hat as he
joined the youthful activists.

"I decided ten years after World
War I that all wars are futile." he
said. “I’ve been a pacifist ever
since, and I believe the Commun-
ists benefit more by bleeding our
nation of men and morale. We
have to end the war now.”

In marked contrast to Weaver’s
sentiments, the Marine leader of
the Nixon group, identified by the
name “Archer” stamped on his
green battle fatigues, carried a
sign reading “Hanoi is Proud of
You.”

"Maybe these people aren’t all
wrong,” he admitted, "but what
they don’t know and what I predict
is that 30 or 40 more Americans
will die this week in Vietnam be-
cause of the Moratorium move-
ment. Hanoi interprets this oppos-
ition to the war as support for
Communism and will only build up
a new offensive.”

Both groups of activists at the

‘ Federal Building. which is located

at the far end of Grant St.. were
isolated from the busy downtown
shopping district. The thousands

of early holiday shoppers. throng-

ing the downtown area that is al-
ready brightly decorated for
Christmas, were unaware of the
demonstrations. Nov. 15, to many
Pittsburghers. meant just another

Senator McGovern believed
that “we are here because we

try.” Other speakers and folk

singers included Dr. George Wald.
Senator Charles Goodell. Arlo
Guthrie, and Richie Haven, and
the cast of Hair.

One of the highest points of
the rally, (“It was a beautiful,
communal experience,” said one
spectator.) was led by Pete Seeg-
er and Father Kirkpatrick. The

entire assembly rose to sing
“Give peace a chance.”

For at least five minutes, all
who were gathered there chanted
the song. swayed back and forth,
and held up their hands in a peace
salute. When it was over, the
masses of people shouted again
and again, "Peace Now!”

alone. It’s much more fun doing

it with someone else.” She has

also lived in South America and has
visited New Orleans, Miami, and
Puerto Rico. Needless to say, she
likes to travel and meet people,
and, according to her, this is the
way to learn about a country.

"You read all ‘about these places
in geography. but you actually
have to live there and see the peo-
ple to appreciate it. I’d love to go
to Europe, but I don’t want to just
see a Hilton Hotel because I can

_do that here. I want to get to know

Rico, I went outwith a boy who
showed me all around the town. It
made the whole trip so much more
meaningful. We had a really good
time.” As far as a permanent
home goes, the new Queen would-
like to live in Boston. During a vis-
it there, she felt that they were “a
different type of people . . . care-
free . . . not worried.”

With all the traveling she has
done, why did she decide to come
here to Oakland to study? Not.only
is'her family from this area, but
her father is himself a graduate
of the University. She explained,
"Ever since we were little he was
teaching us things like ‘Yeah Pitt.’
I think ‘Pitt’ was the second word
I learned.” Furthermore, when
she was a sophomore in high
school, her dad brought her to the

George, Plimpton 

"Author-Athlete”

by MICHAEL EDELSTEIN
Staff Feature Writer

‘The exhilaration of being in a
position and not belonging” is the
reward George Plimpton seeks in
getting involved in the kind of un-
usual situations we all dream
about. The noted author and jour-
nalist, who spent last Tuesday at
the University showed his talent
for gainingacceptance.

In -a noon address, Plimpton il-
lustrated his split personality to
the delight of the attentive crowd.
Standing next to projected images
of various George Plimptons——the
pitcher, quarterback, boxer, bas-
ketball player, golfer and noted
“Winnipeg Gong” —- the real
George Plimpton stood up to the
best comedians in show business.

Creating instant audience crap-
port with quips about the Pitt
Noose and the ease of dreaming
about "throwing a touchdown pass
against Notre Dame" instead of
girls, the Harvard-Cambridge ed-
ucated editor of Paris Review ex-
plained how he gathered first-hand
material for his writing.

While. the audience viewed a
slide of a helmeted Plimpton, head
cocked to the side and with a wor-
ried expression on his face, the au-
thor of Paper Lion described his
experiences with the Detroit foot-
ball team. "Hereyou see me lis-
tening for footsteps . . . while sit-
ting on the bench,” he commented.

The journalist also listened for
footsteps while accompanying the
New York Philharmonic on a tour
of Canada. Soloist on the triangle,
gong and bell, Plimpton depend-
ed on the shuffling feet of his fel-
low musicians to tell‘ him if he
performed correctly. Afther con-

ductor Leonard Bernstein “took-

his bells away” following‘ a me-'
diocre performance, the usually
unsuccessful Plimpton made such
a resounding comeback on the
gong the following evening in
Winnipeg that he was greeted not
only with footshuffling, but a
chance to be gong soloist on a Phil-
harmonic recording.

Spearheading the Pica frater-
nity pledges to a 21-14 afternoon
victory over their “older broth-
ers” despite two intercepted pass-
es. "the Greek Freak (or so his
sweatshirt read) experienced “the
most successful day he’s ever
had.” Although he later jokingly
put Pica, the Interfraternity
League champs, “on par with this
year’s team,” Plimpton admitted
to being a “hopeless Lion fan.”

In a conversation with the Pitt
News, Plimpton admitted a few
other things.

Q. How do you become accepted
by the professionals?

A. Whether the Philharmonic or
athletic team, if you respect them
and your approach is honest and
for research. you’_1l be accepted.
The fact you’re trying to do
something they’re doing cements
the relationship. There’s a com-
mon identity.

Q. How do you react to being
called a Walter Mitty?

A. He always succeeded in his
daydreams. . . . When I try to do
things, they’re not daydreams.
they’re nightmares. I always get
brutalized. Ienvy him.

Q. You’ve played with the

In Final

(Continued from Page 

Lind’s central ‘question was
soon answered in a final way.
"When the Germans marched into
Austria one Friday morning. God
lost ‘his last chance to be recogn-
ized by me." What followed was.
for many Jews. a horrid death in
the gas chambers. But Lind was
no average Jew. _An ardent Zion-
ist. Lind was proud to wear the
Yellow Badge. He was uncomfort-
able in Europe and eager to head
for a home he’d never seen in Pal-
estine. "After living for genera-
tions among people who wished to
wipe themout. the Jews were
ready to be wiped out. They too
believed in the final solution.” As
he put it the other night. "I knew
I was innocent. Those who died
were guilty. They said. ‘If this
happens to me. I must be guilty.‘ I
never saw the real flames in the
gas chambers; I saw the flames
in their eyes.”

Lind refused to be united with
his tormented brethren who be-
came “one people. ‘One heart and
one soul.‘ and later one big heap
of charred bodies." Leaving his
parents. he went to Holland.
where he outfoxed the Nazis. As-
suming a new Gentile identity.
Lind made his ‘way from one job
to another. until he was "safe in
the jaws of the Lion." working for
the air ministry in Germany itself.

How could he do it? Lind “died”
when he allowed a wounded Ger-
man soldier. to perish in a bombed
and burning hospital.’ Having thus

champs. Are they different?

A. They’re forced to compete?

under enormous pressure, a mag-
nification of what everyone goes
through; They’re marked by this.
Boxers are the most interesting
of athletes. The heavyweight

championship is the great mo- .

ment of pressure.

Q. Do you think that competitive
sports could ever replace world
conflict?

A. We let steam off in any num-
ber of ways, what the Greeks call-
ed cathartic effect. War has to do
with territory. Unfortunately, we
can’t clear this kind of aggression
out of our system by watching a

Q. Have you ever thought of

Q. How do you evaluate Vice

mg. There were spirit banners all
around the stadium and no one was
apathetic. Everyone seemed to
care. It was great.”

Besides being the Homecoming
Queen, Patty is also the “Sweet-
heart” of the Fiji pledge class.
She likes to play bridge and read.
She is very fond of the outdoors
and likes being close to nature too.
However, her time for these ac-
tivities is limited because she is
active in fraternity functions.

With a major in sociology, she
plans to be a social worker and
work with underprivileged chil-
dren or families. Her sorority,
Chi Omega, and Phi Gamma Del-
ta, the fraternity that nominated
her. have a program for working

with such children and this has
provided her with some experi-
ence in that area.

Regarding the Homecoming
events, to her, the longest day
was Friday, the day of the inter-
views. Of the crowning ceremony
on Saturday, she confesses, “I did-
n’t really know what happened un-
til my pin-mate grabbed me and
yelled, ‘You did it!’ I guess I was
in a state of shock. Everything
happened so fast.”

The actual voting for the final-
ists is_described by her as “the
second longest day.” She credits
the fraternity (Fiji) with a lot of
her success — “They supported
me very much. All of them and my
sorority sisters, too, worked very
hard to get me elected. I guess

Panther Passing Attack

Assists Rushiii

by ED CONLEY

Associate Sports Editor
Prior to the opening of this fall’s schedule Carl DePasqua
insisted that the Panthers would base their offense on a running
attack. He has followed up on the promise, but strange things

have happened.

The Panthers have used the ground as much as they were
expected to use it, but a couple of passing records will be broken

after the final game this Saturday.
And, actually, the aerial attack is
a more dangerous weapon this
year than last fall since it has
blended in so well with the ground
game.

"That’s kind of prevalent in the
stats and everywhere,” DePasqua
said. Last season Dave Havern set
a couple of records. Those marks
are safe, but a key mark was
h t uarter-

       

   
 
 
 
 
 

back. Jim Friedl.

The game-winning touchdown
pass that Friedl threw to George
Medich in the Army game last
week was the 11th scoring aerial
tossed by the signal caller. With
only the one game remaining, he
has, thus, set the Panther mark
for TD passes in a season.

There are also two receivers
who are matching Skip Orszulak’s

g Game  

pace for pass catches. Orszulak
broke the mark last year by snag-
ging 16 passes against the Lions
in the finale. giving him 50 on the
year.

George Medich has 34 after
nine games, which is even with
Orszulak’s performance through
nine encounters.

No one expects Medich to catch
16 this week against Penn State,
but 0rszulak’s name will prob-
ably be swiped from the record
book, anyway.

Sophomore wingback ‘Steve
Moyer caught four passes against
Army last week giving him 46
receptions. A mediocre day could

place him ahead of Orszulak.

“We knew we had guys who
could catch the ball,” DePasqua
said. “The problem was getting
the ball to them.”

That problem fell upon the
shoulders of Friedl.

In response to the challenge, he

JIM FRIEDI. didn’t know he was going to be the Panther’s top quarterback

until a few days before the season's opener against UCLA. His performance

since that game has pleased Coach Carl DePasqua and his passing has
‘ complemented the squad’s running game.

Students! Whenever a most valuable player is chosen in any
hase of sports, the majority of the fans feel that someone else
hould have won.

Well the Pitt News and WPGH now give you, the fan the
hance to pick the Panther’s most valuable football player for
he 1969 season. This ballot, as opposed to many others, is not
ecessarily asking for a senior
tar or a defensive star but any
layer on the team who YOU think
hould be the Panther of the year.

 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 

has connected on 120 of 243 at-
temps. And his percentage is a lit-
tle better than 49 per cent.

Most of Friedl’s completions
 have been for short yardage, but

 honest, preventing they from key-
 ing on either of the Jungle Cats’
 running threats, Tony Esposito or

they had that extra week's rest,
according to Banner.

Unfortunately the NCAA didn’t

Dave Adams’ wrestlers open their season with a double-
header on December 6, when they battle the University of

an evening contest. The boudle meet early in December will

enable coach Adams to utilize

A new NCAA rule permitting
freshmen to participate in
all varsity sports with the ex-

,ception of football and basket-

Cindrich will join the mat-
men after Christmas vacation,
and will not wrestle in the
Michigan meets.

Also among the returning letter-
men is Junior Mark Payne who was

The quick glaring whistles
and the perpetual thud-thud

beat which accompanies the‘

beginning of action for the Uni-
versity’s long-legged athletes has
once again arrived at Trees
Hall and the Field House.

Basketball coaches Buzz Ridl,
Fran Webster. and Tim Grgurich
are currently drilling their pro-
spective squads in preparation for
the 1969-70 season. Grgurich tu-

tors his freshmen hoopsters throuh-

out the week at Trees Hall be-
ginning 3 :30 each afternoon.

Grgurich indicated that he ex-
pects a team that will be similiar
in quality to last season‘s 9-5
squad. The 1969-70 Cub round-
ball edition includes six scholar-
ship athletes in addition to sev-

eral walk—ons.

In the past, Grgurich has men-

tioned that the non-scholarship
boys are “given the same oppor-
tunities as those who receive
scholarships; they (walk-ons)
work real hard and are good for a
freshman team.”

"We don’t have one, but it
might jell as we get into game
competition. But we’re not as con-
cerned with who’s going to start
as we are with who’s going to

The only player who appears to

., have a starting job locked up is

sophomore center Paul O’Gorek.
The 6-8 O’Gorek led the fresh-

men scorers last year with a.

Ridl’s discussion of the other
four positions sounds like a “Who’s

“And there are about five
forwards — (Bob) McFarland,
(Mike) Paul, (Bob) Cizmarik,
(Mike) Patcher, and (Mike)

Riggle.”

Ridl confuses the listener of the
"Who’s Who?” summary even
more by mentioning "swing
men.” A

“Some players are what you
might call swing-types," he
said. “They can play inside or
outside. So, we may.use two
guards or we may use three
guards?’

“Ridl’s “Swing men” include
just about all of the candidates
for guard, with the exception of
the ‘)5-10 cagers, Caldwell and

the transfer, Edwards. A couple
of the forward hopefuls can be
added to that classification, too.

CHARLES “BUZZ” RIDL
Cager Coach

Ridl and his new assistant.
Fran Webster. are sure of one
thing after the first few weeks
of practice. though.

“Our shooting's better." Ridl
said. “This has been an encour-
aging side. Some of the players
from last year have gained more
confidence. And they’re a lit-
tle more comfortable out there.

"We have some guys who
should have shot better last year."

The cagers shooting per cent-
age last winter was a meek 39.1
per cent. A much higher one is
needed this year against a- sche-
dule that has increased in dif-
ficult. ‘

tants have joined the coaching staffs in wrestling, bask-
ketball, swimming track and gymnastics. F

Fran Webster comes from Westminster College to
join Buzz Ridl’s basketball staff as a defensive specialist.
Webster and Ridl worked together for five years at West-
minster where‘Webster concentrated on defense.

“Because of the results of the past, I’ve got a lot of
confidence in his knowledge of defensive basketball and
we’ll strive to incorporate this into the Panther team,”
commented Ridl. “His addition to the staff enables us
to run our program more efficiently . . . to provide ad-
ditional help to the players.”

Webster also coached high school basketball before
moving into the college ranks and in ten seasons at Hick-
ory High School, his teams won five county champion-
ships and the first Western Regional Class A title in its

JERRY RICHEY
Star Distance Runner

by EVAN PATTAK

Predicting is a risky business
in the field of collegiate ath-
letics, and being of a taci-
turn nature. track Coach Jim
Banner is not especially given to
emotional speculation.

 
 

But the thinclad mentor may be
excused for showing sing os pre-
season exuberance. . A combina-
tion of factors leads the coach to
believe that the times have never
augured better for a successful
indoor track season.

The main reason for Banners
enthusiasm is the large number of
familiar faces among his squad.
The big names of last year re-
turn. almost without exception;
only shot putter Greg Ellis has
graduated. Six of last years top
seven scorers are back giving the
thinclads a seasoned nucleus.

Leading the tracksters will
once again be Jerry Richey,
miler de luxe, Richey is current-
ly recovering from a freak ankle
injury incurred tripping over a
drain. The Panther Speedster
should be ready in plenty of time
for the Kent State opener Jan-
uary 17. High jumper Bryant
Salter, another stickout of last
year, adds poise and experience,
to say nothing of talent, to the
thinclads. '

Smitty Brown. who along with
Richey and Salter competed in_
the NCAA finals at Detroit. will
handle the middle distance races.
Hurdler Elliot Drysdale missed
a good part of last years indoor
season with a leg 'injury.. but
expects to run against Kent State

‘ Neiger Optimistic Despite Frosh

Ineligibility In Several Contests

by PETE NYCHIS

Coach Warren Neiger is very optimistic over the up-
coming gymnastic season. This year, unlike last year, the
squad has some depth in which to work on. “This will be an
interesting year. We finally have the depth we have been lack-
mg,” said Coach Neiger.

"The rest of t_he country is using
freshmen but the conservative
East is not." said Coach Neiger.
Here he is referring to the NCAA

which allows freshmen to corn-‘

Young Tankers

Ready And Able

by JERRY MYERS ~

According to Assistant Coach Dick Bradshaw, the 1970 ~"

season for the swimming team could be the best it had in
years. His most modest estimate is a five and four tally. ’

The majority of Coach Bradshaw’s optimism centers around

the strongest and largest group
of sophomores the swimming team
has ever had. Fourteen of the 28
men on the squad are from the
class of ‘72 and are the result of
the most intensive recuriting
campaigns of recent years.

The varsity coach. Bill Grant
is now recovering from a back
operation and will be back with
the team by December. Coach
Grant took over the team three
years ago and since then has
built it up from one with ten
members to a squad of twenty-
eight. Coach Bradshaw has been
working with the team for about
a month and a half and he is very
confident that the boys will ‘have
a fine season.

The first meet of the new year
will be on January 10 against
Bucknell. Bucknell was the small
college NCAA championlast
year and have since turned big
college. It will be a tough open-
er for the mermen.

Coach Bradshaw 'is depend-
ing on boys like Marc Cohen. a
pre-med major from Pittsburgh.
Rich Rowe. another native
diver. Dave Wessel and a whole
host of others. Rowe is particul-
ar is slated to set a new Pitt
record in the 1000 yard free-
style. Rick. last year. set fresh-
man records for the 1000 Free-
style. the 200 Freestyle. and the
400 Freestyle. Other individual
records set last year by fresh-
men were Dave Anderson in-{the

-200 individual medley. and Alan

Morris in the 200 Breastroke.

"We will probably have a win-
ning season this year,“ com-

ments Coach Bradshaw. "either

6-3 or 5-4. Bucknell. Kent State
Maryland and Grove City will
give us the most trouble. There’s
a good chance we can beat Grove
City though. Kent State has put
.a lot of money into swimming
recently and have a real good
team." 1

A Freshmen will be competing
in most of the swim meets this
season in accordance with the
NCAA ruling of last winter. The
swimmers will observe the prac-
tices of their competitor though
in regard to, individual 1 meets.
_“If the team we’re swimming
against isn’t entering freshmen,
we won’t enter freshmen. Buck-
nell won’t have any freshmen
swimming so the boys will have
to wait until West Virginia.”

The 1970 season extends

through March and will feature
the likes of Penn State Temple,

Maryland. Youngstown, Syracuse,

and the championships in ad-
dition to the teams already men-
tioned. The team is in good con-

dition and they participated in,

a relay on Monday against Car-
negie-Mellon University. They
emphasized short relays against
CMU. They have one more prac-
tice meet against California be-

fore the opener January 10 against a

Bucknell. ‘  q _ L
