I Number, Please?

New Fine Arts Library Has
Space For 50,000 Photos

Now that the Fine Arts Department
will have the seventh floor of the Ca-
thedral for themselves, thcy’ll actu-
ally have some place to put their 50,-
000 photographs.

Yes, you read correctly. There are
50,000 photographs of the art treas-
ures of the world, that the Fine Arts
Library has packed away in every
nook and corner in which they can
ﬁnd space.

Now the Library will have special
rooms all ﬁxed up on the seventh
ﬂoor so that those who want to see
the pictures will be able to get to
them easily.

But that isn't all that the rooms
will have. There will be a special gal-
lery for showing exhibtions of pic-
tures, those reproductions which-the
University owns, and originals from
other sources that will be available
for showing from time to time. The
idea is to constantly have an exhibi-
tion, but to keep the pictures chang-
mg.

On the north side of the building
Philip Elliot, assistant professor of
ﬁne arts, will have his studio so that
heand his students can work by the
northern light.-' This will be the ﬁrs-t
.planned arts studio the University has
had, and it willbe thoroughly equip-
ped, even to having one wall on which
fresco work may be done.

The Fine Arts -Library will occupy
a section of the ﬂoor. In fact, it and
its stacks will take up half the space
of the department. Its library room
will be alcoved. The shelves will be
placed at right angles to the walls,
and in between the shelves tables and
chairs will be placed.

Petitioners
To Request
Plebiscite

Students Ask Right To Vote
On Election Procedure
Of SFA Officers

A petition rcqtic.-_'ting a plebiscite
on the question of aniending the SFA
constitution as to the method of elec-
tion of oflicers appeared on campus
Wednesday afternoon.

Sponsored by James R. Donoghue,
C38, and llerbert R-ackoﬂ', C38, the
petition :1+:l<s that the entire student
body be given a chance to state its
approval or disapproval of the amend-
ment, defeated in SFA, which would
pennit the entire a:-'sembly to elect its
oﬂicers. instead of having them elect-
cd by the executive committee, as is
the case at present.

Requiring the s.ig11atu1‘cs of 506
students, the petition would demand
that ‘the amendment be voted upon at
the elections next Friday, with a ma-
jority vote being necessary to pass it.

Plans to print the picture of every
candidate who will be voted upon
Friday require that glossy prints be
submitted to Mrs. Cubbison in oﬂice
of the dean of men before Wednes-
day. All candidates are asked to co-
operate w.ith this request as soon as
possible.

Each candidate for election to
the Student-Faculty Association,
Men's Council, and College Asso-
ciation is requested to comply with
the request for pictures, according
to Hubert l..ietlelJauI.n, BA37,
chairman of elections. Photos must
be submitted by 4 o'clock Monday
afternoon.

Thirteen Candidates Elected
To Board Membership
In April 5 Balloting

 

Nanies of 13 candidates for the U11-
iver.-Jity Board of Trustees, chosen ac-
cording to a new plan agreed upon
last month by Governor Earle and
(flhancellor Bowman, were reported to
Harrisburg Wednesday morning.

Of the 13, eight were alumni. The
group was chosen by the General
Alumni Association balloting early
this month and in February, and rec-
ommended to the B-oard of Trustees
by Dr. I’. V. McFarland, president of
the alumni. They have been approved
by the nominating committee of the
Board.

According to James H. Young, cer-
tiﬁed public accountant for Main and
Co., those who received a clear ma-
jority werc: E. V. Babcock, A. E.
Braun, Graham Bright, Leon Falk,
Jr., Robert R. Gaw, A. L. Humphrey,
Holgar Johnson, Roy C. McKenna,
Frank R. Phillips, C. IV. Ridinger,
William VVatson Smith, Joseph C.
Trees, and E. A. Weidlein.

According to the agreement of last
month, half of the members of the
Board were to be the choice of the
organized alumni, and not necessarily
alumni themselves. This system of
election, Governor Earle pointed out
at the time, is employed by the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. In accord-
ance with this agreement, ballots were
mailed out last month to all members
of the Alumni Association.

Together with Norman McLeod and
Wilbur D. -Hockensmith, the other
alumni-selected members of the
Board, the 13 just nominated make a
total of 15 chosen by alumni. Of this
group 10 are University graduates.

Council To Determine Role
Of Campus Peace Day
Organization Today

“What is the Role of th-e Peace
Council and the Individual Student in
the Program for Peace Day?” will be
the topic for discussion when the Pitt
Peace Council meets at 1 o’clock this
afternoon in Room 301, Alumni Hall.

No speaker has been scheduled for
today's meeting, which has been
changed from the originally scheduled
location of Roo-m 107, Alumni Hall.
Instead, it will be devoted entirely to
a student discussion on plans for
Peace Day, and will be open to all
University students interested in
peace.

Peace Day will take place next
Thursday, and is celebrated on the
campi of almost every university in
the country as a nati-on-wide student
demonstration in behalf of peace. The
program at the University includes an
assembly conducted by the Peace
Committee of SFA to be held from
11 :30 to 12:30 o’clock in Memorial
Hall.

William Schenck, C37, president of
SFA, will conduct the assembly. Two
main speakers are scheduled ‘to speak.
Dr. Solomon B. Freehof, rabbi of the
Rodef Shalom Temple, has been
chosen as the guest speaker. William
Stark, C38, will address the meeting
as the representative of the student
body.

Following the program a “fast"
lunch has been planned by the Peace
Council. Students will be asked to at-
tend a luncheon for which 25 or 35
cents will be charged and only a bowl
of soup served. The proceeds will
then be donated partially to the youth
section of the Emergency Peace Cam-
paign and part to a student fund that
will be set up to sponsor future pro-
g'1'ains and literature published by the
Peace Council or other peace organ-
izations.

At the meeting this afternoon mem-
bers of the Council will decide on the
place in which to hold the luncheon
and also the price to be charged.

Sophs’ Frolic Features
Big Band, Small Price

 

Even the sopl1omor.e.women have
felt the lightheartedness of Spring,
for they have set aside April 24 for
their dance, and they're going to call
it the Sophs’ Frolic. The time is set
from 9 till 12 o'clock at Heinz.House.

The statement made by Ann Whip-
po, chairman of the affair, is that
“The name of the band is as yet" a
mystery, but it will be a big one; and
the price, too, is a mystery,. but it
will be a small one._” In fact, the only
further information that can be se.-.
cured about the dance is to “Ask your
escorts early, and wait for later news
in The News!”

21 o'clock on the Stadium cinderpath.

' Eulace Peacock and Al .;Tl1readgill;‘
of Temple and Pitt’s Johnny W oodrutf
are the three star tracl~:men who-will
show their All-American strides. With
these three together, thi_s meet should
be one of the best ever held at the

Stadium. At least, it will  the great- V _

appear in Pittsburgh. 1
~ Peacock can be called the “fastest
human in the world.” I~Ie’s the fastest
amateur running, now that Jesse
Owens is a pro. In competition, the
Temple star has beaten Owens ﬁve
times. He, has run the .100-yard” dash
in 9.5 seconds and tlire-_-220‘;in 21.2.’

It’s on -the ﬁeld thatrthe Temple ad-
vantage is shown. Treadgill is inches
above the Pitt high jumpers, Peacock
l1a.s about the same margin in the
broad jump, and Albert Swaar who
pole vaults 13 feet, two inches is a
sure winner. .In theweight events,
Larry Cohen, of Temple, can toss the
shot put 48 feet, 3 inches, while Karl
Scott is a 155 foot discus thrower.

Gene Taano, Penn Relay-.»javelin
champion, shoul_d be Pitt’s only win-
ner in these contests. He’ll be throw-
ing against Peacock and Swaar, but
if Taano is in condition, hc’ll have
no trouble.

This is the hypothetical set-up. It
strongly favors 'l‘emplc, but gives
Pitt a ﬁghting chance to get. the ma-
jority of those questionable points. It
will be up to the Panther squad to

Speaking Qf Underdogs

T 'I‘UESDAY’S SFA meeting the question of

permitting write-ins on the student ballot for
the coming election was broached, discussed, sent
to committee, and answered. According to the in-
terpretation of the executive committee, write-
ins are not constitutionally justiﬁed. The deci-
sion rendered was negative by a close margin.

Possibly the Supreme Court of the local stu-
dent government could have been more lenient
without compromising itself. It might have been
wiser for the executive committee to haveT‘re-
turned a decision in the affirmative if for no
other reason than to corroborate its judgment.

Having chosen candidates for the election upon
the basis of activities and personal recommenda-
tion, the executive committee should naturally
believe that their selections were the best that
could be made. Granted that the nominees were
selected by merit, it is physically impossible to
include all those candidates who might merit
nomination. ,

The suggestion of adopting write-ins as an
integral part of student elections, permitting
those students who fail of nomination to seek
support from. student compatriots, is not a new
idea. First of all, it is a democratic principal of
our national elections; it has been adopted by
many colleges throughout the country.

In national elections we ﬁnd that write-in
candidates seldom mass an important percent-
age of the total balloting. In all probability it
would be the same in our campus elections. Nev-
ertheless there is the contention that write-ins
are of value and should be approved.

Let us consider the possible results of a write-
in were the executive committee to have inter-
preted the constitution to approve it. In the ma-
jority of cases we would ﬁnd that the students
placing themselves on the stump through the
write-in would have a difficult time of it. VVerc
they to receive sufficient votes to place them in
the_cainpus legislature, they would deserve their
position. _Were they unable to do so, there would
be no objection to the more democratic innova-
ion.

Jaunt Jottings

Your “wandering” columnist reserved a berth on that
Glee Club trip last week. Between singing; what is
known as a leinon-tinged baritone at several concerts
and frightening several Atlantic City “boredwalkees”
with a picture of the Cathedral, he scribbled a couple
of notes . . . contained in these most UNWORTHY
lines (We haven’t recovered from “The Good Earth”
yet) . . . CLINT SIPE did the best job of improinptu
dating . . She was MARY BAYLOR REINHART,
Beaver College’s QUEEN of the MAY . . . Boy met girl
at the Academy of Music dance in Philadelphia . . .

I >i

 

Each stage of the journey was able to boast of its
own traffic tag . . . Bill Cover’: entourage tops the list
———two healthy tickets totalling 25 one dollar bills . . .
These Glee Clubbers wouldn't be immune in PARA-
DISE . . . nor were they . . . Two Paradise (Pennii'.)'
police vultures lighted on one of the melody-boys . . .
Quite a battle ensued . . . Final score: Police--$12.50,
"Melody-boy"——0 . . .

The PENN-ALTO HOTEL of Altoona and LOU
GREEN furnish one of the trip’s better.-‘stories . . =
Thursday nite, the boss left word with the management
that each member of the club was to be awakened at
7 :15, Lou knew nothing about the command. The next
morning the telephone operator, on the rounds, rang
the blonde baritone’s room. VVitli his eyes still closed,
the latter reached the telephone and mumbled, “Whatcha
want?” into the mouthpiece.

“7:l5," the operator announced brightly.
“No,” answered Green, “this is Room 233," and
he hung up.
>l=  =l<

The trip itself was the longest and most successful
‘that the club has ever taken. Each concert was followed
by a request from the sponsors for a return engagement
next year. vAfter hearing the formal concert and radio
broadcast at the exclusive HOTEL CHALFONTE-HAD-
DON I-IALL last Saturday, Mr. Adrian W. Phillips, pub-
licity manager of the hotel, had this to say: “We’ve been
hearing glee clubs for ten years around here; but the
PITT Glee Club is the best yet” . . . It begins to look
as if your correspondent may once again sleep in an
$8 room and order dinners via the American plan in
Hotel Chalfonte-Haddon Hall . . . .

LATE FLASH: Les Hafner has engineered another
Cap and Gown publicity stunt to follow up the in-
terview he obtained on DARRELL MARTIN’S radio
hour with GLEN GRAY last Friday . . . Watch the
local papers tomorrow for more pictures of our home

Engineering Instructor Plans
‘Honeymoon Trailer’ , Wedding

OWN DEEP IN THE BEAVER Valley, in Am-

bridge, to be exact, a young University meclianical
engineering instructor is making plans for apsummer
tha‘t, to steal a line from the coining Gap. and Gown
show, l‘lll13,'l)_l; well be titled “Trailer Ho!

It took Ivan Gradisar six months to complete the
streamlined cottage-oii-wheels in which he and the girl
he plans to marry, Miss Ann Hete, of Barbertoh, Ohio,
will tour the far West and California.  -

Following Comnieiiceinciit Day in June, Gradisar will
drive his “honeymoon trailer” to the home of his bride-
to-be, stop there long enough to make it legal, and then
head westward. .«

Last summer the Pitt teacher and his‘ ﬁancee deter-

mined, when visiting the Cleveland Exposition, to honey—.

moon in a trailer. But their plans would cost well
above a thousand dollars. So last fall, Mr. Gradisar be-
gan building his own trailer, chielly by hand in the
basement \V0l‘l{.SI101) of his home.‘ ' ‘

It cost him a ‘total of $300, and the incorporated many
domestic conveniences not found in the most expensive
trailers. -, ~

Every inch of the 16 by six-foot interior of his trailer
is used, to include such features as a four-burner gaso-
line range, dinette ‘table for four persons; ventilation to
remove cooking odors; a photographic “dark rooin;”
storage space; telephone communication between trailer
and auto; a radio and many other luxuries of home.

Mr. Gradisa1"s ﬁancee hasn"t seen the trailer since
shortly after he began work ‘on it. ~

“She’s afraid it won’t come true, so I’1n driving the
trailer to her home a week before we're married," Mr.
Gradisar explains. “Then she can oirder any remodeling
she wants.”

Mr. Gr:-idisar, in addition to being a gratluate of the
University's School - of Engineering, is an expert

The average Pitt fl'CSllmﬂll is ﬁve feet, sevcii iiiclies
tall, weighs 150 pounds, and is 18%: years old. And there
you have a composite pic'ture of a I-‘itt boy, as the Stu-
dent Health Service ﬁgures on ($50 boys have recorded
it. 34 per cent of the men smoked.

   

Voting machines may be used in the SFA spring
elections. Incidentally, the independents will have to
do some good campaigning before the elections to beat
the fraternity factions, who are already lined up.

Ed Springer, Milt Lehman, Ben Siegal, and Bernie
McKenna, all Debating Team members, " were ﬁned
last week in a little Virginia town for narrowly missing
a preacher while driving 80 miles an hour, according to

a postcard mailed to Leo Griﬁ‘i'tl_i by McKenna.

only girl dental student. And Miss Wager is a little
surprised at having that distinction herself!

“There ought to be more girls in dental work,”

1 yellow-haired Miss Wager thinks. “There are just as

many opportunities here for girls," she adds, “as in

any other form of-smedical work." People think that

dentists need physical strength in their work. Rather,

they need a deliciacy and deftness of touch that wom-
en often acquire better than men.”

Crane Comments

Qn Maddenis Part

In, Court Decisiotn [

‘A University professor played an
extremely important part in the. de-
cisions handed down by the Supreme
(Court on Monday. That professor was
Joseph Warren Madden who is on
leave of absence from the Law School
while he serves as chairman of the
Natioiial Lzibor.Relatio11s Board.

A colleague, Judson A. Crane of
the Law School, commenting on the
part played by’P1'ofessor Madden in
these decisions, says:

“To his. careful guidance of the
litigation from .»start to finish is due
the fact that the Court found no de-

fects in the record or any departure

of the board i'i'om the Act.”
Professor Crane asserted that the
decisions favoring the Wagner Labor

Relations and those previously handed

down in regard to the i'iiii1imum
wage case remove two of the prin-
ciple criticis-ms that have been level-
ed at the Supreme Court; namely,
n:i.ri:ow iiitci'pi.'etal:ions of both the
iiitei'-state commerce and due process
claiiscs of the Constitutioii.

“It seems probable that no drastic
Cl‘lEll1‘g‘(.' in the Constitution or in the
powers and mcmbei'ship of the Court
will be iicccssary at this time for the
pui;-pose of cari'yiiig out of New Deal
ob,iec.tivc‘s,” further asserted Dr.
Crziiic.

The \V;ig1ici' Labor Rclzitioiis Act
requires employers of lzibor to deal
with the 1‘(‘.p1’0SGlll.{ll;lVC.S of their cin-
ployees in collective b2l1'g'2I.lll'lllg' and
to i'ci.'rain 1'i'oin cliscliai'giii.g or dis-
criminatiiig because of the union ac-
tivities of employees. Such legislation
is valid only if it constitutes a propei
regulation of inter-state commerce.
Dr. Crane emphasized the fact that
there was no doubt but that the bus
company was engaged in interstate
commerce, tlici'el’ore in view of the
decisions two» weeks before dealing
with railroad labor relations, last.
Monday's decision was to be expected.

In the opinion of many lawyers,
Dr. Crane asserted, it was doubtful
if a majority of the Court would hold
labor relations in such industries as
steel, clotliing, auto--t1'ailci.'s, and the
distribution of news to be a part of
inter-state commerce to such an ex-
tent that they would come within the
range of congressional powers. The
5-4 decision, favoring the Act in con-
nection withtlicse iiidustries was not
expected.

THE YANKS LEAVE

We saw the Shenandoah Valley
between the Blue Ridge Mountains
on our way home. This was Vir-
ginia’s gift to_ the traveler: bril-
liant panoramas of brilliant colors
painted over the rolling country-
side. The perspective from the

mountains revealed an inexpressible

sweep of beauty and color and
- quiet all melted together. Occasion-
..-Plly a buzzard eawed its. way
through the hot sky and disap-
peared in the distance.

We awoke from the spell of the
Southland in West Virginia. A
state cop on 3 motorcycle pulled up
on our side, motioned us over to
the curb.

"Say, smarties, can’t you read?
That sign said ‘Speed Limit 35 miles
per.’ You were going 45. C’mon,
no back talk. Follow me in to town.
No. don't tell me a thing. You can
tell your troubles to the justice of
tlie peace.". " ‘
