 Plans Made
.' For Sale Of

A Board of Education
V ‘ Building Bought To
Increase Storage
Negotiations have been be-
gun between the Board of Ed- ,
ucation and the University for
the purchase of the _Board
of Education Warehouse. The
price of the building has not

as yet been disclosed, because the
sale is not complete. ’

The warehouse is located on
Sennot Street in Oakland across
from Forbes Field. At present the

_ building is used by the Board for

storage. The University will use

p it for this same purpose for the
~’ 3next several years.

‘The Board of Education is a
branch of the City of Pittsburgh
government, and consequently the
purchase will probably have to be
.approved by the city. However,
the Board has definitely agreed to
sell and the University agreed to
buy.’ There will be a delay of sev-
eral weeksbefore the ownership
exchanges hands, because of the

__ paperwork involved.

 . - In, the future the University

A/I,c;O will tear down the warehouse,

_. ' so the area can be used for the
proposed professional schools.

These various schools will have

their own buildings in this part‘

of Oakland and will, surround" a

new library. . . -

The region will remain un-
touched «'for the next few years
until the Pirates ﬁnd a new ball

Dr. Alan C. Rankin, assistant

Dr. Shepard L. Witman, director
of the Office of Cultural and Edu-

the University on a new’ commu-

Council for International Visitors.

This organization will be de-

The Council is one of the sev-

Since the offices are located
on campus, and University re-

manager, Paul Boltacz, the
semi—rigid formula .for deal-
''ing with used book sellers is
to pay 50% of the book’s
original price and to sell the
book at 75% of the cost, thus al-
lowing a 25% profit. ’

Before applying this formula,
the book must not only be useable
for the next term, but it must also
be in good condition.

In announcing the plans for the
dedication, ‘Dr. Litchﬁeld said:
“Mr. Scaife’s interests were «di-
verse, and his contributions to
civic improvement were many. It
is signiﬁcant that the Health Cen-
ter experienced its greatest period
of development and achieved in-
ternational recognition» during his
term as chairman of ‘the Board
-of Trustees.”

“The iUniversity will always
have a personal debt to Mr. Scaife

tions of time and interest which
he made in the Uni’versity’s-be-
half.” - .

As chairman of the Board of
Trustees, Mr. Scaife led the
campaign to raise funds for the
construction of the Health Pro-
fessions Building, The 10 mil-

mittee, will deliver the dedicatory
remarks. Richard M. Scaife, son of
the late Mr. Scaife, will take part
in unveiling the memorial plaque.

Masters Degree 
Program Offered 
In B.us.Ad. School

The School of Business Admin- '
istration will offer a new program
in September, whereby students
may earn a masters degree in bus- /
iness administration ’ in eleven
months. ' '

Previous business courses are
not required for participation in
this program. It is open to all 
students with bachelors degrees 
who have demonstrated suﬁicient’
academic ability to complete the
course successfully.

Dr. Paul Kohberger, acting dean
of the School of Business Adminis-
tration, points out that this new
program incorporates the ﬁndings
of most recent studies in the ﬁeld
of business education.

« Conclusions Outlined
1) The best education for busi-
ness can be obtained after com-
pletion of undergraduate study in
another ﬁeld.

2) Present day business re-
quires that the executive_under-
stand problem analysis, human
relations in business, analytical
economics, and the latest tools
and techniques available to bus-
iness managers.

3) Education is much more ef- .
fective if students are given the

or Activities ee e
_ W There is a noticeable lack of student activities“ on cam-
; pus this trimester. '

   
  
 
   
    
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
   
 
  
  
    
  
  
   
  
   
 
 

_ Although practically half of the trimester is gone, Stu-
dent’ Government has not come up with any type of major
"activity, such as a replacement for spring carnival. Cer-
btainly this group should ‘take the initiative in such planning.

, Two theater groups, Pitt Players and Shoestring Pro-
ductions, scheduled programs earlier this term, only to

nother production before the end of this trimester, and
gave can only hope that this one will materialize.

Fraternities and sororities are almost completely inac-
‘tive. Pan Hellenic Council and Inter-Ffaternity Council are
not even meeting. Perhaps it is too late for these’ groups to
-make plans for this term, but certainly they should look
i ahead to future spring trimesters, and even consider rushing
at_ this time.

' Some organizations haveattempted to continue regu-
larly scheduled, events. Publications are going ahead almost
lfullscale. The music groups are active.

The only group that is attempting to plan social activities
isthe Student Union Board and its committees. They have
_provided bridge lessons, Friday night dances, iced tea hours,
and an occasional Midday Series.

All of these events, however, have not been well re-
ceived by the student body. This might be an indication that

students do not desire to plan or participate in activities
ifthis. term, butprefer .to devote their time solely to intel-
dectual matters. If so, they should not be discouraged. But
the paucity of students in thelibraries does not indicate this.

Students, then, do not seem to be doing much of any-
thing this term. It’s time for someone to take the initiative
and bring some life back into the University. .

Jim Vaughan ,
Industrial Foods Inc., operates here at Pitt under
a yearly contract that will terminate. at ‘the end of
July. They will soon come .to ask the University to
renew that contract for another year. Should they
be permitted to return? a
This question will be considered soon at a meet-
ing of people on the business side
of the administration. In making
this decision, thecommittee must 
as it surely will, be aware of
certain things.
It must remember that Food 

 

in serving good food satisfac-
torily." Surely, it understands

come from diners who either 
don’t or won’t like the food they r‘
are served on a particular day.
It will see also that complaints are inevitable when
F. S. faces, twice a day, large numbers of hungry
people iwho .want‘ faster service than is possible.
And it will remember that among Food Service’s
many handicaps is the old kitchen equipment.

The committee will also consider the possibility
that the uncomplimentary articles on Food Service
that appeared in The Pitt News are untrue. This
I deny, of course.

Then there’s the possibility, that what was said
in these articles is true, i/nwhich case the com-
mittee has a problem. on the one hand it must
consider the profit Industrial Foods Inc., gives the
University. (The word on this is that Pitt gets 8%
of gross proceeds, leaving I. F. I. whatever proﬁts
it can -make ‘after paying their overhead). ,The
committee must, on the other hand, acknowledge,
painful though it is, that it has responsibilities _for
the health and welfare of everyone who eats food
served at Pitt. _
whoa 'l'o Blame‘? - .

That is, it should consider that if unsanitary
conditions existed*— in the cafeteria kitchen, if F. S.
did serve unwholesome food, and if F.‘ S. does cut
too many corners in an attempt to make maximum

 

profits, Industrial Foods Inc., is to blame.’ For this-

~company must ensure that its local branches serve
only food that is clean and wholesome. A
’ "The committee might even ask Dr._Swartzbaugh
to tell what he has long known about the UNDE-
SIRABLE conditions he has surely seen in the
kitchen while he was director of the Student Union.
The members of this academic body might even
consider the wisdom of the following. When the

present. F-. S. manager was asked what ‘was the .

value of having an independent business operate
Pitt’s food services, he answered: _
1. “The University is saved the trouble of
handling 150 more people in the payroll __dept.” I
2. “Pitt does not have the advantage of a central
purchasing department for the purchase of foods.”
3. “An independent company is well organized
while the University would have to hire people who
do not know how. to handle the job.”
The first answer, the'committee will surely ﬁnd,
is silly, because the addition of 150 employees to

 

A Few Changes

the University payroll will hardly burden the Uni-
versity payroll department.

Even less sound is the third answer. Being com-
posed of wise businessmen, the committee knows

that with a minimum of effort and thought it can «

hire a competent manager and easily keep on
most of the present F. S. help while training others.
The second reason is the only sound one, be-
cause a- central purchasing department does save
money. But it should not be too diﬁicult for Pitt
to organize its own central food purchasing-ofﬁce-
storehouse. .
A Change.-for i-he Beﬂer a
In short, I am suggesting a slight change. I

suggest that the committee discontinue the Indus- . '

trial Foods Inc., contract and form its own Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Food ‘Services Office to be run‘
by an experienced manager. Other schools have
done this; so should we. We serve enough food on
_campus that a fair amount of money should be saved

in buying food in large quantities when it is cheap. «

The committee might also consider the need for

closed dining rooms for dorm students. It certainly, 

cannot make such changes by September, even if
it wanted. Yet, it might plan private dining rooms
for the future dormitory system still on paper.
But it shouldn’t be impossible for the committee
to organize a University Office of Food Services by
the Fall tri-term, if it really wanted. If it does not
do this, it should at “least bring into the University
another food enterprise, such as Stouifers, even if
Stouﬁers will serve cleaner and better food at the
cost of giving a smaller kick-back to the
University. ' '
Paper and Wood V .' ~ '
The committee might also consider the Tuck
Shop. ' N

Z

 

  

Three years ago, when the price of paper cups 

and plates was cheap, someone made the unpopu-
lar decision to_‘ remove all porcelain cups and dishes

from the Tuck Shop. Those of us who eat there. 5 S a

now‘, still resent having to eat from paper and wood-
~ The advantage of using paper is .»that paper

plates save space in storage and labo_r in handling‘. _-

» Paper plates and cups are no -longer cheap. Card-

board cups, for example, cost from 1% to 1%
cents each. I ‘ .
_We should go back to porcelain china and metal

utensils. To do this we need only. a-_ $1900 dish-.:—‘.N":

‘The extra cost ofiadditional help would beioﬁset ,‘

by the money saved. by not using picnic—ware.

 

' All the,needed china is available. Plenty of it,” 1'1 " I 

‘inherited; from the old Schenley Coffee Shop, lays

in the store room. __
_,.If it is true that the paper and wood in the Tuck

I Shop is resented by people, it is only fair that this-

stuff should go. During the last two tri-terms, .the ‘" I " " 

Tuck Shop served. 4200 people each day, Monday‘

through Friday, while the cafeteria, where every- ~
thing is served with normal tableware, served only
~ half that number. .

Brackenriclge Housing
Called Poor. Planning

Editor, The Pitt News:

At the beginning of the tri-
mester I paid $175 for a room at
Brackenridge_ House. One does
not mind paying this amount.for
the lovely accommodations that
are provided for in this dormi-
tory. -

However, when one pays for
a dormitory room, one expects
to use it as a.quiet place to

study and to relax. In _recent
 weeks, I have not found this
_possible.

The building directly across
from Brackenridge is being re-
novated, and early in the morn-
ing the noise starts, as bricks,
boards, and plaster are thrown
down a tin chute into- dump

machinery of all sorts grinding

Not only is one unable to
study or sleep, but also, one can-
not even open the windows be-

Ou-r Great University
Strides Eaver._/Onward’

Editor, The Pitt News:

Ah, our great University takes
a giant step forward in the
total integration of allits mem-
bers into “one big happy fam-
ily.” Freshman beanies, plus a
little good ole frosh-razzing will
obviously produce a “together-
ness” unequalled in the annals
of all science! You of _course
know, this ~will develop good
“school spirit.” Hip, hip, rah,
rah, and all that.

Let’s think this over people!

Picture yourself a freshman ,

again. Do you remember how
scared and afraid -you were
when you first ‘came here?
Pretty frightening at ﬁrst; but
these feeling soon wore off when
you found the University ac-
cepted you as an individual, as
a student and as a member of
the college on equal terms with
everyone else. It probably didn’t
take you long to feel like you
were, indeed, a member of the
University! ‘ ‘ '

But, oh, no, things aren’t good
enough to satisfy some souls.  
They tell us that setting off the A
freshmen "as something “differ-‘ *

ent,” or “as creatures infinitely

below the levels of mighty soph- V

omores, juniors and seniors’_’ will

produce a wonderful integrating  " V
effect! New studetns will just: .-

 

love a university that forces  ' 

(yep, tha_t’s the right word),
them to do things a junior-high"
school pupil would consider
silly! (Note to admissions officers;
how many intelligent future stu-
dents do_ you expect ‘we will
lose when they decide to attend
colleges that place emphasis
upon education —instead.of “ap-
plied tomfoolery?”) "

Oh, I can just picture the cries
and moans from some quarters
how —- they shout in righteous

rage,’ “Its’ only innocent fun! _

Frosh razzing is harmless, and
besides, it’s for their own good!”
Listen, when anyone tells’ you
something is “for your own
good,” beware! But all this is
beside the point; I leave now,
with one thought — What good
can come from freshman razz-.

Thinclads Take Small Squad
To I C 4A Championships

-~ This-is the ﬁnal weekof scheduled competition for Coach‘

Carl Rees’ trackmen, who succeeded in reaching their 2-3
dual meet mark of last season. This weekend the Panthers
head for Villanova and the IC4A championship.

According to Rees he will take one of the smallest squads
in recent years to compete in the two day event.

About the only Panther who
stands any real chance for success
is Co-Captain Mel Barnwell.
Barnwell clipped off the 440 last
Saturday against 'Vil1anova in
47.8, one of his betterwtimes for
that event. In the century Barn-
has been running 9.8 and he has
done 20.8 in the 220-yard dash.

Even Barnwell will not ﬁnd
the going easy. Competition is
thick and rough as usual with
runners like Penn State’s‘ Bob
Brown and Villanova’s Bob Rae-
more seeking victories.

Larry Och and Dan Kanell both
ﬁnished fourth in the Penn Relays
this year and must be considered
contenders in their events, the
shot put and discuss respectively.

Och holds the school record in
the shot ‘with a‘ toss of 53’—8”.
“He _may break that again this
week,” Rees commented. :As for
Kanell, he has been a steady im-
prover in the discus and threw the
sphere 1615-11” at the Relays. His
effort is less than eight feet off
the existing school record.

Ron Rush, the other half of the
co—captain combination, may enter
the mile or two mile runs. Dick
Chadwick, who won the college
hammer throw in the Relays may

be able t-o "pick up a few points

toward the team championship.

  Boltacz Gives

Store’s Policy

Of Book Resale

(Continued from Page I)

' set up by the wholesale jobbers in

a “blue book” similar to the one

"used on the automobile market.

1 Rates Low
While this provides no direct
and immediate service to the stu-
dent, it does allow the Book Cen-

«.ter to purchase these wholesale
used books from the jobber. This

helps the Book Center stock used
books and provide them for the
student at low rates.

Boltacz added that “Operat-
ingon a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served
basis means that a number of
students will be able to purchase
[used copies of their texts while
others will have to buy new
copies.” '
This applies also to the sale 0
books by the students to the Book
Center.The resale price of the
used books ‘go down as-the num-
ber needed diminishes.
. Value Drops
In cases where the store has
advance knowledge that the book

‘is due for revision shortly, the

value drops to almost nothing
since even the wholesaler doesn’t
want the book now. A maximum
of 25 cents is paid for these books.
Their only use would now be
in a bargain sale where a stu-
dent might pick it up for his

‘ personal library. "

Technology books, mostly kept

' for reference, do a brisk new book

business. While books of the hu-
manities, English, history, math,
and the like-, ”do a
much greater used book business.
- Used and New W
The University Book Center and

the Student Book Center Inc. on

Forbes St., are the only places in
the immediate area where used
books may be purchased. Other

‘The Student Book Center Inc.,
part of a chain,— approximates
that half of its business is done
in used books. They emphasize
that not having’ advance knowl-
edge of the boolis to be used in
ensuing trimesters, they must
pay _a lower price for them.

In many instances they must
go by lists of books wanted sent
from out-of-town campus‘ book-
stores. '

New Masters
Program Given

(Continued from Page 1)
gram incorporates all these major
ﬁndings, according to Dr. Kohl-
berger. '

Learning Methods
V Enrolling students will learn the
newest methods available in busi-
ness education in such ﬁelds as

administration and human be-
havior, analytical methods, man-A

agerial economics, management of
human resources, marketing and
production management, and man-
agement of ﬁnancial resources.
Field trips to local businesses will

, enable the student to observe ac-

tual business operations. __

Dr. Kohberger said the program
not only will provide the future
executive with all necessary busi-
ness skills, but also will empha-
size the necessity of the execu-
tive’s understanding all _aspects of
his ﬁrm’s operations and recogniz-
ing his relationship to phases of
the business which are not his
primary concern.

Besides wringing extra miles from every gallon, and besides stacking up as 1960's
outstanding car—look what else Corvair has in store for you. The smooth-as-butter
ride you get from independent suspension at all four wheels. The increased

traction that comes with the engine's weight over the
rear wheels-—where it should be in a compact car. A
practically ﬂat floor, a folding. rear seat, ﬁve -jaunty
