married students, starting school
in February, will have fewer dif-

In and effort to alleviate the
apartment situation, the office of

According "to Mr. Saalbach, this
poll is run periodically"so that

ceive more attention. 1

Mr. Catrow was still away last
spring semester. Bush doesn’t de-
serve it. "In the- ﬁrst place. the

is not yet lost.

Catrow calls himself an ex—GI.
He ends this lovely editorial with
the time-worn battle .boosters of
Iwo, Bulge, and Saipan. That
stuff is worn frail. You’re not go-

him. Give it time. This year’s

Bush (the frustrated) should
know‘ the true setup in our little

now. Sure, Bushy, we’ve got a-
lot of ideas, but then we’ve got
the administration’s thumb in our
back too- Anything worth ﬁght-

, (Editor’s note: Careful reading ’of the editorial entitled “Get on the Band Wagon,” by Bill Catrow,

which appeared in the Dec. 20 issue of the News will disclose. the lines, “The unnatural apathy can be
attributed in part to the inﬂux of veterans . . . And a goodly percentage of themlare . . . ”) ‘ A

<|Editor, Pitt News:

.The editorial, \“Get On- The
Band Wag-on,” which appeared/in
the Dec. 20 issue of the Pitt News
is a masterpiece of phony ideal-

an inexcuseable distortion of facts
is very dangerous. The writer
delivered a verbal spanking to
8500 members of the student body.

Mr. Catrow should begin read-
ing the paper for which he writes.
I ‘refer to the Pitt News of Nov.
19,- 1946, under the headline “May-
or Pledges Aid To Vets.” I quote
an excerpt." from’ the resolution
presented to Mayor Lawrence:
“We feel that students attending
schools of higher educationand
most of all veterans should.be
given some pass for use during
school hours.”

On Dec. 10, 1946 in a front page
story, under the headline “Veter-
ans Lose Pass Battle With "Rail-
ways,” appeared the following:
“Previously the Veterans associa-
tion had tried to get street car
passes for‘ all students but had
failed because of a provision by
the railwaysu It was that no one
could get a pass who was not un-
der the compulsory attendance
regulations of the state,‘as public
school students are.”

Let’s examine the distortion of
facts. Catrow states: “If they
(the veterans) participate, it will
be as ‘vets’ rather than as college
students.” In the next paragraph
he accuses the vets of “fostering
a caste, system.” Catrow, you
must begin reading ‘the Pitt News.
The issue of Nov. 1, 1946,.under‘
the headlines,‘ ‘_‘Vet‘ Association
Stages Initial Meeting Today,”
featured a front page story with
the following pertinentfact: “Out
of 8500 veterans now ‘enrolled. at:
Pitt, 1200 have been granted mem-
bership in the organization (Pitt

Panther Floormen Seek Second Victory

Nate Apple Leads
Panthers To First
Win of the Season

An apple a day may keep the
doctor away, but not if the doctor
is Doc Carlson, Pitt mentor, and
the apple is Nate Apple, Panther
forward and captain.

Apple was just what the Doc-

-tor ordered Saturday night and

his ﬂoor play was brilliant as he

‘paced the Panthers to their ﬁrst

victory in ﬁve starts, a satisfying
42-31 triumph over Penn State.
The ﬁve foot, eight-inch forward
dropped in 18 points to top all
scorers.

Were it not for an uncanny ac-
curacy at the foul line, the game
might have been a rout. State
garnered seventeen points on free
throws, with eight registered in
the second stanza when they were
limited to ten points.

By dint of some wild One-hand-
ed push shots, State stepped off
to a quick lead. The Panthers ﬁ-
nally knotted the count at the 11

’ minute mark and there was never

more than a point difference ’til
the intermission when the Lions
led, 21-20. ‘ A
With the start of the second
half the men from Mt. Nittany

but it was a hopeless task against

Tomorrow Evening

After their welcome victory
over Penn State Saturday the
Panthers have a fine opportunity
to duplicate the performance of
the 1927-28 team. ~

The Carlson aggregation of that
year dropped four of the ﬁrst ﬁve
encounters and then went on to
complete the schedule by snaring
ten of the next twelve games. Pitt
hopes to extend the winning trend
against the Tartans at the Carne-
gie Tech gym tomorrow evening.

The Tartans have been thrash-
ed handily in their ﬁrst four
games by West Virginia, Geneva,
Waynesburg, and Buffalo. This
year Tech is coached by Bill Do-
nohoe, spectacular Tartan half-
back in 1924, ’25. and ’26.

ed the Tartans all season. They

_/Missing Students

By Tony Glasser

While scraping a ﬁve-foot pile of cigarette butts away from the
front of a NO SMOKING IN THIS AREA sign the other day, I was
accosted by a group of worried women.
However, none of their children had
not been home since last September. Sorta’ prodigal prodigies.

lost. I put on my best Ellerye
‘Queen manner and attempted to
help them. ‘

Verbally boxing the group into
a corner, I asked pertinent ques-
tions. Namely. why hadn’t this
been reported sooner? They all
agreed, “We thought our children
were trapped in Hotel Schenley by
the recent strike. Now we see all
these bell-boys around so we know
the strike is over.” I

I hastily explained that those
bell—boys were Pitt ROTC stu-
dents, but that the strike was
over. .
I had other questions. Lost in
the fog‘? Amnesia? Reenlisted?
Each one met with the same
answer, No! So far, solving the
mystery had been about as ef-
fective as the no-card—playing—
regulation in the Tuck Shop.

“l\/[issing since September,” I
kept repeating to myself. Then,
buried in the catacombs of my
mind, I found the answer. Reg-
istration at Syria Mosque! Bound-
ing up the boulevard, we entered
the Mosque. There we found
them——weal«:, emaciated, under-
fed, but still strong in their desire
to register for the fall semester.
