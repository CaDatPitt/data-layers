 French Play
  ‘Tovarich.’ Set

For Feb. 7.3

 The Department of Modern

Languages and the Speech De-

partment will present the French

‘play “Tovarich” on February 7
so and 8, in the Stephen Foster Me-

morial. This is the ﬁrst time that
0 two‘ departments have worked ‘to-
gether to present such a program.

“Tovarich,” which will be per-
} formed entirely in French, is a

comedy concerning the cosmopol-

itan society of Paris. The charac-
 ters are immersed in politics and
business . Certain events and
names used are authentic, but
most of them were created by the
playwright, Jacques Deval.

Deval has been a prominent
dramatist of the post-World War
I theatre in France. His produc-

tion of “Tovarich” in 1933 has
proven to be his most popular
work.

The cast of the play includes
members of the faculty, gradu-
ate and undergraduate students

‘ at the University as well as fac-
tulty members and students at
Carnegie Tech, and. Duquesne
University.

“Tovarich’f is sponsored jointly
by the Department of Modern
Languages and the Department of
Speech and Theatre Arts. There
is no charge for admission.

The French Department has also
made tentative arrangements to
present, sometime in March, the
world famous Treteau de Paris
dramatic troupe who will present
either Sartre’s “No Exit,” or Ion-
esco’s “Bald Soprano.” This pre-
sentation will also be made in
conjunction with the Speech De-
partment. V a

High School Students
Offered College Credit

High school juniors and seniors can earn up to six col-
lege credits toward their freshman year at therUniversity,

starting next September.

A special six—week session will enable qualiﬁed students

to complete almost all of the work.

required for the first term of their
freshman year.

Under the trimester calendar,
the academic year is 11 months
long and divided into three 15-
week terms. By attending all three
terms students can ‘graduate in

two and two-thirds years instead

of the traditional four. The addi-
tional savings Pbssible under the
new program could reduce that
time to a little more than two and
one-half years.

According to Everard'K. Pinneo,
director of admission at the Uni-
versity, other advantages of the
program are that it gives begin-
ning college students a chance to
become oriented early to college
life and to college work, and‘ en-
ables students
deﬁciencies and to correct them.

Both programs, which grew
in part» out of the work of the
University’s Coordinated Educa-
tion Center, are aimed at im-
plementing one of the Univer-
sity’s primary goals: to give
every student both an under-
graduate liberal arts education
and professional training or ad-
vanced academic study.

Trimester and other ’ti_me-re-
ducing programs, according to
Chancellor Litchﬁeld, are ways of
ﬁnding new time for students to do
both “without seriously delaying
their entrance into a profession or
career."

Begins June 26
The summer, session, which will

. begin on June 26, is open to high

school juniors who rank in the
top ﬁfth of their class and who
have been recommended by their
counsellors, and to seniors who
have graduated from high school

Director of University Press

Explains u, Recalls Past

By KAREN HALPERT
High atop the horn-honking,
traffic-and—student-jammed streets
in modern Oakland, in her sharp-
ly contrasted, nineteenth century
Victorian office, Agnes Starrett
directs and edits the work of the
University of Pittsburgh Press.
~“The University of Pittsburgh
Press aims through publications of
books and other printed material
to extend the University’s teach-
ing and research beyond the class-
room, the laboratory, and the pro-
fessors study," says Mrs. Star-
rett.
l\/lrs. Starrett began her work
with the University Press ten
years ago, but she has been with
the University for 38 years. She
graduated from the University in
1920, and both her children re-

ceived. degrees from the school.

Wonderful” Crowd

“Dr. George Crouch, Prof. Ed-
win -Peterson, Dr. Fred Mayer,
and I went to school together,”
says Mrs. Starrett. “We had a
wonderful crowd and learned so
much from Professor Hunt who
was then head of the English De-
partment.” She is presently pub-
lishing a book written by Profes-
sor Hunt, entitled “Fifteenth Cen-
tury England.”

In 1937 when the University
celebrated its 150th Anniver-
sary, Mrs. Starrett was asked to
write a book°‘~concerning the his-
tory of the University since its
founding in 1787.

In the book entitled “Through
150 Years” Mrs. Starrett tells
about the buildings, students, and
courses offered by the Un.ivcrsity.

Press Grows

Ten years ago when Mrs. Star-
rett took charge of the Univer-
sity Press, they were publishing

,three to five books a year. Now

the number has increased to about
20. It concentrates on books of in-
terest to people in this area. No
textbooks are printed. '
The books have received a
number of awards especially for
typographical excellence includ-
ing the coveted “50 Books a
Year” award given to the 50
best books published each year
in the United States.

Last year both Mrs. Starrett and
her .husband received honorary
Doctoral Degrees from Waynes-
burg Collegem Mrs. Starrett re-
ceived a Doctor of Letters degree,
and her husband, a Doctor of,
Science. She was recently honored

‘as one of the ten outsetanding

Pittsburgh women of the year by
The Pittsburgh Post Gazette.

Pennsylvania investor-owned electric light and power
companies take the lead in nuclear power progress with
three of the-,.nation’s 17 plants, in operation, under con-
struction or planned.

The aggregate capacity of these three Pennsylvania
nuclear power plants will be 145,000 kilowatts. In con-
trast, in all of Russia there is only one nuclear plant de-
voted. to power production, and that has a capacity of
only 5,000 kilowatis!

SHIFPINGPORT ATOMIC POWER STATlON—-—the world’s first

large-scale nuclear power station devoted solely to peaceful .

uses. In addition to producing power by means of the pres-
surized water reactor, this station has provided extensive in-
valuable information on uranium oxide fuel element per-
formance, core reactivity changes and associated control.
factors, and on problems of health physics, radio chemistry
and waste disposal.

SAXTON NUCLEAR POWER PROJECT—-now under construc-
tion. This is basically a research project which willﬁxplore the
most promising concept of the pressurized W,  reactor for

economic production of nuclear power. This ’acility‘has been ‘

 

designed and constructed so securely that it is extremely un-

likely that storms, ﬂoods. earthquakes, fire, or even a missile

hit would produce a nuclear accident. The Saxton plant is

being built at an estimated cost of $8,520,000 to pﬁrticipating
ymvcstonowncd electric companies.

PEACH BOTTOM ATOMIC POWER STATION--scheduled for
completion late in 1963. High Temperature Reactor Develop-
ment Associates, Inc., including 53 electric power and light
companies in the country, have contracted for this nuclear
power project at a cost of $26 million. Employing a high
temperature, helium gas-cooled, graphite-moderated, solid-
homogeneous reactor system, this project represents the first
application of a new high performance concept. Its purpose is
to serve as an effective prototype for future i'ull—scale plants
designed to produce electric power competitive in price with
conventional power.

Big things are happening throughout Pennsylvania's pro-
gressive electric industry; and there are exceptional oppor-
tunities for the capable engineering graduate to be a part of
this vital movement. ,

THE TRUE  TRAGICAL TALE OF
HAPPY JACK SIGAFOOS

‘Who would lxave thought that Happy Jack Sigafoos, the boy
the sky ne\'e1' rained on, would teeter on the edge of a life of crime?
(7crt»a.i.nly there was no gig-:1 of it in his boyhood. His home
life was tranquil and uplifting;. Allis mother was a nice fat lady
who bummed a lot and gave baskets to the poor. His father
was a respected citizen who could imitate more than 400 bird
calls and once saved an elderly widow from drowning in hisl
good suit. (That is, Mr. Sigafoos was in his good suit; the

,.elderly widow was in swimming trunks.) Happy Ja.ck’s life

was nothing short of idyllic--till he wcnt‘0'll' to college.

Ilere Happy Jack quickly became a. typical freshmun—-
twcedy, seedy, and needy. He learned the joys of rounding out
his personality, and he learned the cost. His allowance vanished
like dew before the morning sun. There were times, it grieve:-1
me to report, when he didn’t even have enough money for a
pack of Marlboro Cigarettes--and you know how miserable
that can be! To be deprived of M'arlboro’s matclnless flavor, its

e._asy-drawing ﬁlter, its subtly blended tastiness, its refresliingi

mildncss, its ineflable excellence, its soft pack or ﬂip-top,box-—-
why, it is a prospect to break the heart in twain!
M.«arl.boro—less and miserable, Happy Jack tried to get more
money from home. He wrote long, impassioned letters, pointing
out that the modern, large-ca.pa.city girl simply could not be
courted on his Integer‘ a.llowa:nce. But all Jack got back from

home were tiresome homilies about thrift and prudence. .

Then one dark day a sinister sophomore came up to Jack o,

and said, “For one dollar I will sell you a list of ﬁendishly clever
lies to tell your father when on need some extra. money.”

He gave Jack‘ the list of endishly clever lies. Jack read:

1. A bunch of us follows are getting together to buy a new
house for the Dean of Men. ' . 

2. A bunch of us fellows are getting together to buy 9, head.
stone for Rover, our late beloved dormitory watclidog.

3. A bunch of us fellows are getting together to endow a chair
of Etruscan Art.

4. A bunch of us fellows are getting together to build our .

own particle accelerator.

For a moment poor Jack was tempted; surely his father could
not but support all these laudable causes. Then Jack’s good
upbringing came to the fore. He turned to the sinister sopho-
more and said, “N 0, thank you. I could not deceive my aged
parent so. And as for you, sir, I can only say-—ﬁel”

llpon hearing this the sinister sophomore broke into 9. huge
grin. He whipped off his black hat and pasty face—-and who
do you think it was? None other than Mr. Sigafoos, Happy
Jack’s father, that’s who!

“Good lad!” cried Mr. Sigafoos. "You have passed your
test brilliantly.” With that he gave Happy Jack a. half million
dollars in» small bills and a red convertible containing powe:
steering and four nubile maidens.

‘Misconceptions’

Editor, The Pitt News:
In the recent editorial on the

A fraternity rush several misleading

statements were made. Let me
point out your basic misconception
ﬁrst,‘then we will venture into the
particulars. You seem to under-
estimate the worth of the frater-
unity system and casually disre-
gard their very important role on

> ' this campus.
What is this role that frater-

nity men are playing? Well with-
out ’Greeks there would" be no
floats, housefronts or queen, as
fraternities play the only part in
them.

But I’m sure the Inquiry Club
would get someth-ing together in

the way of a float. Of course‘
therecwouldn’t be anyone coming V

home, for the Greeks are the only
real draw for homecoming.

As the school year progresses
we ﬁnd there would be no
“Greek Week.” Of course this
-void could be ﬁlled by “Liberal
Week,” “Conservative Week,”
and “Hate Week” for the Marx-
ists. _

 ‘Fraternity Aims’

One must admit that the fraternity system here
at the University has made measurable advance-
ments in some phases of its activities, however,
their failure to follow their own stated precepts
has rendered any other strides‘ superﬁcial and
ineffective. _ _ "

Each year Interfraternity Council publishes a
handbook which serves as an in-
troduction to the fraternity sys-
tem for‘all prospective rushees.
Besides the many stories and A
features explaining the activities V
of fraternity life, the booklet _

“Fraternity Aims.”

On this page are set forth the
goals and ideals of the system
and of its individual members.

ternity organizations throughout
the country, our own system on campus has a great
deal of diﬁiculty living up to its own standards. _
“Fraternity Aims” stresses Primarily the indi‘
vidualfraternity member. A fraternity’ is supposed
“to teach men how to live and work together,
striving by precept and example for the personal
development of the individual.” However, anyone
who has ever seen a fraternity descend en masse
on a sporting event can hardly call the procession
of stalwart brothers followed by the blushing baby

pledges a display" of individualism.

Extra-legal Drinking . ‘
It is also very difficult to see any ‘personal

development of the individual” in drunken oﬁ-
campus parties. If this extra-legal skirting of the
University liquor code produces any personal quali-
ties ‘in the “brothers" it is only those of alcoholic
gluttony and disrespect for administrative authority.

And how can a fraternity claim “to teach men
how to live and work together” when eligibility
for membership in a fraternity is often decided
on purely religious or racial lines. Theoretically,
a Catholic can join Sigma Alpha Mu or Phi Ep-
silon Pi, but how many in reality ever do or are

/ever evenencoura-ged? And how can a Jew from V

New York develop as an individual if he only asso-

ciates with. other Jews from New York or even

with other Jews from Pittsburgh? '
Abnormal group participation of this type sel-

dom preduces individuals, it produces mimics. The ~

pledge mimics the active and is in turn copied by
other pledges when he becomes" a brother. It, is

selves in producing‘ these molded stereotypes, or
whether fraternities naturally attract an un-indi-
vidualistic type of clientel is rather difficult to
ascertain. ‘ » ’ '7‘
However, it would appear upon investigation
into the fraternities and their members that both
factors contribute to the development of this un.
healthy situation. The fraternities strive to devel.
op a tight bond of comradeship and conformity
which will extend into all aspects of university_
life. This includes conformity of dress, manner,

 

morals, and unfortunately, mind. The pledge is J

constantly brainwashed into believing that he is a
member of the greatest institution ever created, and’

by the time he ﬁnds out that it is simply not so, his‘. 

only recourse is to go inactive and chalk his frag

ternity years oﬁ as bad experience.

Base for 'Sharp Guy‘

Concerning the type of person which the fray

ternity usually attracts to its ranks, it can gen.
erally be said that it is one in need of a social

crutch. However, if the really “sharp guy” decides ,

to pledge, it usually means that he is in need of
a base for his activities, and not because he is
dependent upon the fraternity to supply his social
life for him.

From these above comments, it is obvious that
if anything is developed along the line of indi-
viduality, it is the subjugation of the individual
to the clique. One must, of course admit that a
fraternity man will often hold his own in a non-
fraternity crowd, especially a social crowd, but any
such opportunity for individual performance is held
subsidiary to the interests of the “band of brothers.”

This is not to say. that fraternities develop
only lackeys, for our own history has shown that
fraternity men have advanced ~ to some of the
highest positions in our country. However, it is
entirely plausible to assume that they did this in
spite of their fraternity background. and not be-
cause of it.

The fraternity man is, therefore,‘ strictly a so;
cially-minded animal, but must he be content with
this position? Yes, if he is to remain a fraternity
man. For in his attempt to assert his individuality
as a fraternity man, he can only succeed in kidding
himself" because his ‘purported individuality is
simply non—existent.

believe. On the‘ contrary there are
two substantial reasons for the
poor rush. First and r..ost prac-
tical there are only ﬁve freshmen
men entering this trimester and
freshmen supply the bulk of fra-
ternity pledges.

Second and most abortive is
that certain factions of groups
who know nothing about fra-
ternities use their power rather
arbitraritly to suppress the
fraternity system.

In a recent edition of The Pitt
News this supression can be" seen
quite readily. The front page con-
tains a two column spread with
a picture on some “would be ath-
lete” who ran around the quad in

his undershorts while the an-

nouncement of the IF smoker was

’ Case for SC-

Editor, The Pitt. News:

In this letter I we would not
address‘ ourselves to the details of
one for another plan for Student
Government reorganization.
Rather, we wouldilike to state the
case for SG and the reasons for
voting to continue it.

Concerning Mr. Nclson’s re.-
marks in the Monday, January 24,
issue of The Pitt News on the
individuality’ of the student, we
would say amen. lWe do_ not see,‘
however, that an organization
structured to act as a “sounding
board” for studen‘. opinion and
capable of representing that op-

inion to be administration will

curtail individuality.

Coming down out of Mr. Nel-
son’s nebulous idealism, let us
look at the reality of our situation

concerning government. We exist

in a social context. Therefore, the
will of the majority must be given
dueconsideration so that the total
-Welfare may be furthered. This is
a basic premise of a democratic‘
society and not a utopian impos-
sibility. - -

Given our democratic context,
men have found it necessary’ to
structure their environment,
throughout history, -to beneﬁt’
the greatest number possibje, ’“
Here at Pitt this ‘needhas been
felt by s C dents to the extent of.

of which have existed for many
years. Why then, not give these
organizations some focus and
center "for coordination to better
enable them to do their jobs?
The. constitution of the United
States has been amended 23 times.
This is the ﬁrst time in three
years that "the _Student Govern-
ment ‘constitution has been up
for amendment. Our present con-
stitution is good but not the best.
And, this maturation‘ process can
only occur if Student Government
continues to exist.

To some who agree with Mr. "‘

Nelson, it may seem that the
easiest thing to do would be to

junk the whole affair. No doubt _

Mr. Nelson has gained great pop-
ularity through his remarks. But
then. those who search for the
easiest way always have many
followers.

We are now asking you as stu-
dents to _ give Student Govern-
ment the opportunity to mature
and to become a .more_ effective

representative body, in the future.

Think seriously on both plans for
constitutional amendment, . a n d
then display the responsibility we
college students are frequently ac-
cused of lacking by voting ‘to
continue a strong Student Govern-
ment. '

“Folk” music has become ex-
tremely popular on campuses,”
she theorized, “because of every-
body’s great desire to participate
in . entertainment.” She added,
quite seriously, that today’s stu-
dents usually cannot afford to
continually pay for entertainment,
and, as a result, search for ways
to entertain themselves.

Continuing her discussion of

her “favorites” in the ﬁeld are
Judy Collins, Don Crawford, Paul
Clayton and “my own little
daughter, Joan Biaz.”

When asked about her famous
copper earrings, she explained
that the ponderous decorations
were given to her by a friend in
Los Angeles on the eve of her
ﬁrst professional appearance at
the Tin Angel, at night club in
San Francisco. She was held
over atthe club for a year and
she has worn the earrings ever
since.

The earrings and two simple
rings were the only decorations
for the drab green gown which
Odetta were when she appeared
on the stage for an overcrowded
audience.

After a few numbers, she intro-
duced her bass player, Bill Lee,
whom she described as “a beauti-
fulehuman being.” The applause
grew after each song, whether she
was “Goin’ Back to the Red Clay
Country” or searching the reek
for the “Jack 0’ Diamonds.”

After intermission and a cos-
tume change, she sang several of
her more well known songs, in-
cluding the highlight of the eve-
ning, “Man With the Long Chain
On.” The overwhelming applause
indicated that her two curtain
calls were not enough.

Final Plans For SC-Student
4   Referendum Now Complete

By STAN NASTEIN

Student Government referen-
dum. ballot to allow students to
change Student Government in
one of two ways or to dissolve SG
completely will take place on Feb-
ruary 7.

Dave Menzer, chairman of the
Student Government’s ballot com-
mittee, announced that the voting
will ‘take place between 9 a.m. and
4 p.m. As in the past, there will be
four polling places. Students may
vote in either the Commons Room
of the Cathedral, the Student Un-
ion, Engineering Hall, or Scaife
Hall, the health professions build-
ing.

To vote students must present
their invoices to the ofﬁcial who
will either stamp or punch the in-
voice. Students will be presented
with a paper ballot; on the left
side of the ballot the two “Yes"
votes will be placed on the right
side, the single “No” vote will be
placed. The voter will\ place a
check in the box next to one of
the three choices.

Unless the total “No” votes
exceed the combined total of the
two “Yes” votes, the “Yes” with

the greater number of votes will
be deemed the winner.

The ballots will be tallied by
the ﬁve-man SG committee, and
the results will be released that
evening.

Vote Questioned

The appearance of the “No”
vote has raised question as to the
legality of the dissolution. of the
Student iGo\/ernment by student
referendum. Under the present
constitution the “No” vote is not
provided for and is, therefore,
technically illegal.

According to Bernard Adams,
however-, Student Government
advisor, “Any kind of govern-
ment must either be imposed
or must grow out of a need. If
the imposition of the govern-
ment is also illegal, then the
question of ‘need presents itself.”

The major’ purpose of SG is to
reﬂect the desires and needs of
the students to the administration.
If the students themselves feel no
need for a student government,
then that government should be
dissolved.”

chess-like’ pseudo-basketball game with Press Maravich, the ‘coach

of Clemson. They methodically

moved salt and pepper s'ha.\ker:-‘

about, maneuvering them for shots in a verbal contest.

Moore, who once said he would trade a team with desire for
one 6-8. man, was in his glory. His pivotman was a 16 oz. bottle
of Pepsi-Cola, easily the biggest ﬁgure on the formica court. His for-
wards were two bottles of Blatz, whose amber ﬁgures towered over
l\/laravich’s salt and pepper shakers. ' ‘

‘‘Here’s how to stop the Auburn Shuffle," Moore roared. This
wasn’t a PTA meeting where some prudes were trying to outlaw an

This unfounded terminology brought a few guffaws from lVloore’s

The 6’5“ Hooley scored 27 points

history to go over that mark.
With his ﬁne performance, Hooley

not only scored 19 points, but also

trouble for the Panther mat-
men as they easily disposed of
the Wildcats, 19-7, before a
sparse turnout at the Field
House on Friday.

The win gave the Cats a 3-0-1
record and saw Rich Martin, John
Zolikoff and Ken Barr remain un-
defeated and untied in dual meet
competition this season. Martin
now has a 20-0
record in dual
meets at u r i n g
his career.

The only sat-
isfaction t h a 12

em may have
received in the
drubbing were
the facts that
they h a n ded . .
sophomore Tom Tom Jeffries
Jeffries his ﬁrst dual meet loss
and spoiled Jim Harrison’s all-
winning season by holding the
Virginian to a tie. Harrison now
joins Daryl Kelvington as wrestl-
ers with a 3-0-1 records
It is doubtful if these two
matches did anything to sooth
the feelings of Northwestern’s
classy young coach, Ken Kraft.
But the mentor failed to show
his disappointment. as he had
only praise for the victors.
"' “Pitt has a real rough squad
with a lot of balance. They are
the best team we’ve met this
year," he‘ commented. “I was
especially impressed with their
lightweights, Martin, Zolikoff and
Kelvington.

“Zolikoff really surprised me. I
didn’t believe that he could get
his weight down to 137 pounds
and still be strong. I guess he
proved me wrong. He was real
tough out there.” ,

The results prove Coach Kraft
to be correct.

to that,” chipped in his roommate
Bob Long, an end on the Panther
football. team.
“He would say a prayer be-
‘fore going to bed, concerning
him and the team.” And prayer
is not the secondary thing in
Sankey’s life as it is in the lives
of many other college students.
“Basketball is second to reli-
.-;ion' for me,” says Bob, ywho
takes a Bible to all away games.
“It’s great for your mental de-
velopment,” remarked the senior,
who once thought of entering the
seminary. “Not even my Civil

""l‘h.e camp was sponsored by
the Fellowship of Cliristizm Ath—
letcs. Its purpose was to make
‘us realize that there is more in
life than just sports; Of course
we spent time with athletics.”

“But the main objective was
the religious aspect of an ath-
lete’s life,” added Bob quite se-
riously. The organization meets
every 'I‘hurs.day night on cam-
pus and Sankey's ‘roommate

(one no stranger to religion as
the boys on the seventh ﬂoor
of Schenley will conﬁrm) is an
active member of the group.

Thus Bob Sankey, the "Preach-
er’, basketball player, and future
Civil Engineer has made his a
substantial contribution to Pitt.
