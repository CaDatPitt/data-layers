 Board Opens
Its Campaign

Red feathers, giant posters,
and campaign slogans mark-
ed the opening of the Pitt Chest
Drive yesterday, as drive com-
mitteemen began preparing for
the collection to be taken up on“
Wednesday of next week. i

To pep up student response to
the Drive, the committee has in-
stituted a variety show to run on
the day of the drive. All organiza-
tions and activities are being ask-
ed to contribute a skit.

Eliminations for‘ the Variety
Show will be held on Thursday,_
Nov. 4, at 7:30 p.m. in 208 CL.

All ‘student organizations have
received cards on which the or-
ganization will write the type of
skit they will but on.

Cards Not Necessary

If these cards have not been
turned in, the organizations may
still participate in the elimina-
tions, according to Chairman Ab-

, . by Clark.
 — 0 1 The Varsity Show will be held

in Foster Hall, Nov. 10.

Inaugurated last year by Stu- P
dent" Congress for the convenience
of students, the drive combines
seven: different campaigns with
the regular Community Chest ‘

C Drive. It is the only collection
taken up during the semester.

Included among the seven spe-
cial organizations aided by the
drive are Pitt—in—China, Men’s

Loan Fund, Women’s Loan Fund,

—CARE, Chest Reserve, United Ne-

’ gro College Fund, and the World

Student Service Fund.

Importance Stressed

Abby Clark, chairman of the

Drive committee, urges all stu-_

dents to give as generously as pos-

sible, and adds, “Everyone knows
how important the Chest Drive is‘
to the community. It is not mere-

Iy for the sick, the needy, and the

l
s

underprivileged; it serves the
whole community and affects the
lives of all of us.” .

p “The Community, Chest Drive is
one of the few programs in‘ which
Protestants, Catholics, and Jews -‘
set aside their religious differences
and work together in ‘an inspiring
example of religion-at—work.”

. Speakers _will be sent to each
class room at third A and sixth
hours to collect contributions. If a
student is without money at the
time he may give a pledge and
contribute later.

students _wouldn’t even be in
the running. Not, at least, if Dr.
Robert Doherty, president, of
Carnegie_Tech were the judge.

During last Monday’s march
on Tech a group of students
crowded into Dr. Doherty office
and demanded an audience.
When he appeared a spokesman
for the group stepped forward
and began to state the position
of the_ students with regard to
athletics.

The spokesman went on at
some length until Dr. Doherty,
realizing that he didn’t recognize
the young man, asked if there
were any Pittﬂstudents in the
group. Six" raised their’ hands.
One of them was the “spokes-

Dr. Doherty recounted the in-

week. He offered no comment.

To University

Westinghouse Electric Cor- i

poration’s gift of $200,000 for
a new science building and li-

an important step forward for
the University. 0

Dr. H. E. Longenecker,
Dean of the Graduate School and
of Research. in. the Natural Sci-
ences said:

“The generous Westinghouse
gift is welcomed, not only because
it carries the University one im-
portant step closer to the realiza-
tion of a new science building,
but also because of the spirit in
which it was given.

Two Groups? Work Together

“Recognizing clearly the for-
ward progress of the University
as an important force in the fu-
ture of the great business organ-

ization he heads, Gwilym A. Price,’

president of Westinghouse, noted
the manywaysvin which the Uni-
versity- is ,.now integrated with
Westinghouse. _ V " - _ .-

“Upon completion of the pre‘sei1.’t
building program, the opportuni-
ties. for the. University to be of
service will be vastly’ increased.”

The $200,000 gift was announc-

ed last. Wednesday by Westing-f
_ house. The gift was voted by the

Westinghouse Board of Directors.
Faith in Future 0

Terming the gift an “evidence
of faith in the future of Pitts-
burgh and its University,” Price
said that Westinghouse “is proud

  PVEN A LITTLE HELPS

.-

Earlier this year we ran a letter from the local director

 of the CARE agency in which she quoted Mrs. Eleanor Roose-

. Chest Drive was on the way. - _
\Vell, the Chest Drive is almost with us now, and over in

’ --the Letters to the Editor column you’ll ﬁnd another letter

-—one that comes a little closer to home. It deals with an old

._University interest in the foreign ﬁeld—Pitt-in-China—the

Chinese university at Lingnan, China.
I Pitt-in-China is one of the most noted institutions receiving

 aid under the Pitt Chest campaign, but it is certainly not the

only one. The VVorld Student Service Fund, CARE, and six

0' other organizations are among the beneﬁciaries. ‘ V

The Pitt Chest Drive corresponds to the Community Chest
drives now going on throughout the country.’ Just as the
Community Chest provides for the needs of a locality, the Pitt
Chest serves the student community.

All over the world there are students who possess the
desire and the talent for a University education, but lack the

'_ means to acquire one. It’s to them that we 3 extend hel

~ through the Pitt Chest funds. '
‘ As you can see by the letter from Lingnan, even a little

‘bit goes a long way toward making things easier for them.

That ’s important, because a lot of people get the impression that
if they can’t make a large contribution, it is better that they
give nothing at all.
Drive Chairman Abby. Clark is asking for $2 from each
student. But if that isn’t possible don’t feel that you can’t
help. The donation you may consider too small to give would
probably mean the lightening of a tremendous burden for some-
one who, like yourself, wants an education.

Give what you can——and as much as you can. Remember

« Jthat your contribution may help to give to some student over-

seas the opportunity that has been given to you.

IT COULD HAPPEN ACAIN

Stephen Foster Memorial Hall was about half full last
Saturday night-—-a tribute to a bad break on the social calendar
and the drawing power of the Panhellenic reception.

Pitt Players put in four weeks of intensive rehearsals in

preparation for “The Philadelphia Story.” They deserved at‘

least to be heard after all that work. Instead they found

1 themselves up against competition with a social event that
: “comes close to being compulsory for -600 or so women. Because

of that, the Players show was something less than a terriﬁc
success. ~ '

That«’s past, however, and,,can’t be, helped, now. But’ it

 can be prevented from happening again——ei'ther to the Play-

eIf's or any other organization that depends upon student sup-

 port for -its success.

So far nothing has been done to prevent such a repetition.
Perhaps those who have charge of the social calendar will wait

_ until it is too late again.

Attleboro, Mass. — (I.P.) — The

“You can count on the ﬁngers of

He is a former national president

“This system is responsible for
housing and feeding and guiding
nearly one third of the students
of higher education in our coun-

in the wilderness, a voice unable
to distinguish between the democ-

that this system is basically the

Mr. Balfour said that there are

and property valued at more than
a quarter of a billion dollars.

He contended that the fraternity

the oldest brotherhood on this con-_

as a protest against afascist form

Mr. Balfour advises Sigma Chi

Mr. E. J. McIntosh
Assistant to the Dean of Men
‘The University. of Pittsburgh
Pittsburgh 13, Pennsylvania
Dear Mr. McIntosh:

Thank you heartily for the
contribution of $78 allocated to
Lignan University from the Stu-
dent Chest Drive of the Spring
of 1948. We are deeply grateful
for the greatly increased contri-
bution received from Pitt this .
year in comparison with contri-
butions received in recent years.
We are in the utmost need of
such generous help, and I can
assure you that the money is
being well used. I consider it
almost unbelievable that the ad-
ministration and . faculty of
Lingnan University have
brought that institution back, to -

" a standard of work apparently
‘just as good as that characteriz-
ing our best years before the
beginning of the war. Indeed,
the Chinese faculty is '5\ndoubt-
edly superior to any we had
previously.

Cordially yours,_

This is the decision of Dr.

James S. Frame, dean of the‘

Dr. Frame studied samples of the grid lottery diicats andxi

came to the conclusion:

“It’s a good way to lose money.”

The tickets givethe better only‘

games must be bet on and a han-
dicap is also assigned to each con-
test. ‘

The odds against winning mul-
tiply with the number of games
bet on, Dr. Frame stated.

For example the mathematical
chances of winning are one in 16
if four games are played, one in
64 on six games, one in 256 on
eight games, and if ten games are
picked the‘ odds soar to 1024 to
one.

That is, if 1024 persons put one
dollar apiece on 10 games, one of
them will win-$100 ‘and the house
will rake in $924 worth of blue
chips, according to the Michigan
mathematician.

Rep. Buchanan declared, -“The

‘reciprocal trade program is the,

one key to world recovery and

“U. S. prosperity.”

He refuted the charge that the
Marshall Plan is a primary cause
of inﬂation, citing that in 1947
only 4.1 per cent of the total na-
tional production was sent abroad
and in the ﬁrst quarter of 1948
two per cent had already been ex-
ported.

Rep. Fulton asked the audience
not to be discouraged with-the
United Nations. _

He said, “Our generation is the
integrating factor that can work
out rules for international trade.”

-In answering a question from
the «floor, Rep. Fulton said that
Thomas E. Dewey has rejected the
protective tariff wing of the Re-
publican party. ‘

Acting as moderator and open-
ing the discussion was Dr. Reuben
Slesinger, of the economics de-
partment who stated, “If economic
conﬂict continues you can look
forward to World War III.”

Crowded Pitt Continues to Use
SSM Hall for Aclditiona|Space.

By SHIRLEY LEVINE

Originally dedicated to the hon-
or of soldiers and sailors, veterans
of the Civil War, Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial Hall is a vet-
eran itself in everyday campus
life. ' . _

Gradually the hall has. assum-
ed a place on the roster of “Uni-
versity buildings” which it is not
apt to lose as long "as crowded
conditions exist. A ‘

Actually, ‘the building at the
foot of the hill on what was once
called “the campus” is not the
property of the the University, but
belongs to Allegheny‘ County. For
the past four semesters Pitt-has

rented classroom space. Professors
from every - department ‘have
taught there. Psychology students
and law ‘students, business law
majors and future teachers, all
have found themselves leaving the
Cathedral in rain or snow for a
class up at Soldiers and Sailors.

Scene of School Aifairs ,
The hall, one of the largest in
the city, ‘has always been availa-
ble for University aﬁairs. Foot-
ball rallies, psychology tests, and
the traditional Tap Day programs

have become Soldiers and Sail- .

Oscar Thomas Taylor, superin-
tendent of the hall for the past
four years, has some interesting
comments to make on Pitt stu-
dents who use,. however unwill-
ingly, ’the facilities of the build-

Taylor related.

Taylor also related some of the
history of the _hall. Dedicated in
1910 to Civil War veterans from
Pittsburgh, the hall was managed
by a board of ten Grand Army of
the Republic members. Soon after
the First World War, the county
was faced with the fact that GAR
veterans were far and few be-
tween as old age caught up with
them. 4

Gradually the Civil.War' vets on

the board were replaced with rep-
resentatives from three other or-
ganizations: S p a n i s h—American
War _ Veterans, Veterans of For-
eign Wars, and the American Le-
gion. Today, a twelve-man board,
composed of four representatives
from each of these organizations,
manages the hall.

In recent years this board has
denied only one veterans organ-
ization the right to hold a meeting
in the ha1l—the American Vet-
erans Committee.

It’s amazing, isn’t it, what a few victories can do to salve over
the Wound of bitter denouncement of a losing football team, beleag-
ured coaches, and stumbling administration.

Pitt’s Panthers veer off the road leading to gridiron ruin, prance
along a winning tangent for four weeks and what happens? A burst
of ‘ enthusiasm ‘with the student, body celebrating and the press

going overboard with a buildup—all of this muffling the critics, ,at

least temporarily. -

. This is all well and good if the big buildup isn’t followed by a
big fall. There’s nothing worse than a violent contrast and that can
%,happen here. It seems to this corner that we’d all be better off if
lthiis out-of-proportion surge of optimism was curbed until We’re
sure winning football has returned to stay.

The breath—taking triumph over an injury-riddled Indiana club
showed the Panthers at their best and was worthy of the ensuing rally

' and celebration. Bu the victories over West Virginia, Marquette, and

Western Reserve hardly come under the same classiﬁcation.‘

minute old, however, Reserve was’
in possession of the ball on th Pitti
six. Panther halfback Bill Abra-i
ham had made a free agent of the!’

 

kickoﬁ roll untouched inside his:
own ten.

Reserve end Leo Spann sped!
downﬁeld and fell on the ball. _

Pitt’s defense, however, batten-I
ed the hatches for the impending
storm, and all thatcame was a
Western Reserve drizzle that stop—
ped on the two—yard line.

Pitt took over and.immediately'
paraded 98 yards to a TD. Abra-
ham spearheaded the drive, and
Becker climaxed it with a two-
yard plunge. But Bolkovac’s at-
tempted conversion was blocked,
hisﬁrst failure of the season. ,-

Rader Connects

In the ﬁnal period, Becker hit
paydirt‘ again by bucking over_
from three yards out. Bolkovac
was successful this time in add-
ing the point.

"The score was doubtless heldl
down by‘ a steady inﬁltration of
Pitt substitutes. One of them-—
Emil Rader'——set up the third TD‘;
however, with a 53 yard pass to

Rifle Practice
Begins Soon

Pitt’s sharpshooters, under the
watchful eye of Sgt. Watts J.
Shablowski, are beginning to
limber up their eyes for another -
season of riﬂe competition.

Men have not -yet been selected
for the ROTC or varsity. ‘riﬂe
teams. All students registered in
the University are eligible for the
varsity team. Those enrolled in
ROTC classes may shoot with the‘
ROTC team.

The Varsity Team plans‘ to
make two trips—one to New. York
City and the other to the National
Riﬂe Sectional Meet.

Plans are also under way for a
three—team league in Pittsburgh
between Pitt, Duquesne, and Tech.
The league will operate under the
rules of the National Riﬂe Asso-
ciation.

Matches will be “shoulder to
-shoulder” competition, with high
scoring shooters and best team
standings to be awarded trophies
and medals.

Firing under Army regulations,
the ROTC team will shoot from
four positions, kneeling, standing,
prone and sitting. Competition
consists of the Hearst matches and
the postal matches required by
the Army under the honor system.

Injury List Swelled ,

As Frosh Get Rough  

. _ By DAVE SMITH

Hard play by Pitt’s freshman football squad has produced a num— V
weeks of practice. Among these is 7,

ber of results during the ﬁrst six

, an injury list which numbers nine at the present time.

Latest additions ‘to the group include Bob Brennen, ex—North

Catholic fullback, Soral Myers,

former Fifth Avenue guard, and

Eugene Cooper, halfback from McKeesport. _
This trio received their injuries in a recent -rough scrimmage

lined two of them.

It began with Cooper -carrying‘
the ball through a hole in the line.
Brennen, defensive backer—up, hit
the ball-carrier with such force
that he knocked himself cold.

Out for about half—an-hour, Bob
Was taken to Mercy hospital,
where he spent the night. After

due observation, he was released‘

the next morning.

Cooper came out of the collision
with ‘a badly bent nose. Eugene,
however, pronounced himself ﬁt
as ever after the cartilage had
been pushed back into place.
Neither he nor Brennen was per-
mitted to participate in any con-
tact work the following week.

Prior to the Brennen—Cooper
encounter, Myers had the misfor-
tune to smack a cleat with his
nose. ‘Since there was a foot in-
side the cleat, Soral lost the bout.
He suffered a compound fracture
and a severe gash below the eye,
which required seven stitches t

convenient method for handling
problems constantly arising in ap-

The newly proposed scheme lies
in an extension of the zygograph,

termined by the speciﬁc problem.
Results obtained to date agree ex-4
actly with results obtained by

tension of the zygograph method
to broader ﬁelds appears promis-
ing.

Non-Degree Students Work
For Knowledge. Not Credits

.More than 2350 students are

program for non-degee students. The new classiﬁcation, which in-
cludes students in the under—graduate schools and the graduate
school who were formally termed special and unclassiﬁed, was set

up during the summer.

According to Carroll ‘F. Reynolds, Directo of the Late After-
noon, Evening, and Saturdayvclasses, all students Who have not sub-

now enrolled in the University’s

mitted
schools or other colleges are in-
cluded in the non-degree pro-
gram.

These students pay the same
tuition and fees as degree—seeking
students, and may receive credits
for their work.

On the presentation of proper
credentials, a non-degree student
may transfer to one of the degree-
granting schools. The number of
credits thus transferred will be
graduate degree and six for a

credentials from highé

limited to thirty ‘for an under-
graduate degree. Such a limita-
tion is necessary, Dr. Reynolds
stated, to afford proper supervi-
sion of the student’s program.

Dr. Reynolds expects the num-
ber of students enrolled -to reach
the 3000 mark when ﬁnal regis-
tration totals are released. Ev-
tension of the program to cover
special summer—session students is
also being planned.
