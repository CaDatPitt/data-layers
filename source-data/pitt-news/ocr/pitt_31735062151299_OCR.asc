for the rushing season which be-

Helen P. Rush, assistant to the
Dean of Women, who has greatly
encouraged freshman education
concerning fraternities explains, “In
this day and age, no one should be
asked to enter into anything unless
they fully understand it. We
postpone rushing long enough
for the freshmen to be-
come orientated to the institu-
tion as a whole, If a. girl can
say, ‘Knowing all groups, I choose
this one,’ she will not only be en-
abled to get more out of fraternity
life, but she will be able to- contrib-
ute more to the group.”

Speakers representing the admin-
istration, the alumni, and active
fraternity members will discuss
women"s fraternities from their
several points of view.

The Freshman Education Commit-
tee in charge of the meeting is com-

College Plans
For Semester

 

 

Info.rma1 and Formal On
Social Calendar

Completing one of the most suc-
cessful semesters in the history of
the organization, the College Asso-
ciation’ swings into the last half
of its social season with two danc-
es. planned for the second semester.

The first event planned by the
Association is an ihformal dance at
the Hotel Schenley on Friday even-
ing, February 19. This dance~was

but because of a conflict with the
Interfraternity and Military Balls,
the February date was selected.
The second dance will be a formal
affair on April 8. According to John
Crumrine, president of the Associa-
tion, the date ‘for the formal is also
tentative_ pending changes in the
University social calendar.

Harold Cronin, social chairman,
will be in charge of both events.

Memberships in the Association
for the second semester are now
being sold ‘by the Cabinet and may
be obtained for $2. This assess-
ment entitles the member to attend
both dances scheduled for the sec-
ond semester. '

According to figures released this
week by the Association, a net
profit of more than $200 was made
during the first semester. This am-
-‘cunt will be used in advancing
loans to deserving students.

Roaming Pitt

Debaters

Reach Oregon On Tour

Eugene, Oregon, February 4.
(Special)-—-The roaming rhetori-
cians of the University of Pitts-
burgh, Samuel Strauss, Cyril Jac-
obs and Professor W. M. Parrish,
arrived in Eugene this morning.
This is the twelfth lap of the 6,000
mile journey the debaters are
making. '

The debates have been following
one another so quickly that the
debaters haven't had time yet to
study the question. At Minnesota
the debating Panthers first argued
Socialism in the campus music
hall, then dashed to the Elk’s Club
—the toughest crowd of hard
boiled liberals in the country.

Minnesota had a great case on
Centralized Control, but “Si"
went off like a gattling gun stead-
ily strewing corpses right and left.
"Sam” then went wild in rebuttal
and shouted that all Congressmen
save those from Minnesota, could
be bribed! The club enthusiastical-
ly voted both teams -honorary
memberships in the organization.

The Pitt debaters put the first
one in the bag when they backed
Chicago into a corner by mere ex-
cess of noise. After the debates
the boys usually answered ques-
tions at a forum, chase off to catch
a train, or get dates for some so-
cial stepping.

Here is the way “Sam” describ-
es his feelings on the -trip over
the Dakota prairies: “A perfect
moon in a perfect sky, on a per-
fect snow—and not a girl on the
train under forty. No matter. Sam
sat on the observation platform
and lived in memories. “Si"

Rent Books

Appropriate $5,000 for
Reference Tomes

The Board of Trustees of the
University has appropriated $5,000
for the purpose of installing a non-
profit rental library of the most
used reference books. At present
it is planned to have the library
situated in the University Book-
store.

It has become increasingly diffi-
cult for the University Library to
stock enough of certain much used
reference works to permit students
to use them outside the library.
According to John Weber, busi-
ness manager of the University,
under the new system where suf-
ficient copies of the necessary
books are stocked, it will be possi-
ble for students to use the books
at home, paying a small fee which
will be used to purchase additional
works.

The faculty is now preparing a

Professor Herskovits' lecture

Languages Intangible

"Of all the intangibles of civili-

vits “Language must be regarded
as a social phenomenon. Isolation
of an individual will not produce
language, for it takes two to make
a language. Language requires a
thorough social background. Apes
and monkeys do not have lan-
guage. Their sounds are merely in-
stinctive noises, Man did not ge-t
his language by mimicking ani-
mals because this does not explain
the involved elements and enorm-
ous vocabularies in language.

Study Under Stress

Professor Herskovits is an auth-
ority on the speech of New World
Negroes. He stated, “The best way
to study any culture is to study
it under stress. It is therefore in-
teresting to note the cultural re-
sult of the inter-marriage of ne-

W.S.G.A. Asks Coeds to Consider Need

For Change in Name of‘ Organization

 

Heads Seek To Express
Modern Functions

 

The advisability of changing the
name of the Women’s Self Govern-
ment Association was again dis-

cussed at the meeting of the com-
mission last Thursday. This change
was ﬁrst suggested at the fall con-
ference of the commission last Sep-
tember.

The reason for raising the ques-
tion can be traced to the general
feeling among members of the
executive committee and the com-
mission that W. S. G. A. is no long-
er a governing body and that its
functions are misrepresented to
the campus under this title.

W. S. G. A. was founded in 1920
on the pattern of our federal sys-
tern of government. Its functions
were divided and planned to repre-
sent the three divisions of the na-

partment was composed of the
elected officers with the chairmen
of the standing committees forming
the cabinet. The legislative branch
was represented in commission,
where all the Women’s organiza-
tions oncampus sent one member
to take part in the transaction of
business. Carrying out this pattern
Senior Court was established as the
judiciary department.

At the time of its founding, its
function was that of a governing
body. Activities were still in an
early stage of development and
needed the guidance of a stable or-
ganization.

In the years that have elapsed,
W. S. G. A. has expanded in so
many directions and added so many
functions, that the question of
whether or not it is still accurately
represented to the students on
campus under the title of “govern-
ment” logically arises. —

There will be an open date in
California occasioned by a slight

Boulder, Colorado, and Denver Un-

held a debating tournament with
forty teams entered; so the team
is expecting some exceptional de-

ers will have their little argument

‘ In Fight Against Japan

Declaring that Japan, in adopt-
ing an aggressive policy against
China, had violated international
honor and respect, Clement Wang,
a senior in the University Dental
school, and president of the Chi-
nese Student Club of Greater Pitts-
burgh, said this week that propa-
ganda measures were being initiat-
ed by the Chinese students in Am-
erica.

“Financial support has already
been sent to the Chinese National-
ist government by the Chinese
groups in ‘America, and efforts are
now being concentrated on furnish-
ing adequate publicity for the Chi-
nese cause,” asserted Wang.

The fact that Japan was seeking
to overrun the eastern provinces
of Manchuria with Koreans, who

are Japanese subjects and under
Japanese judicial authority, was
said by Wang to have been the in-
direct cause of the present con-
flict.

Wang's home is at Chinwangtao
in Hopei province on the Manchur-
ian border. The town is on the sea.-
coast, and according to reports, is
being menaced by Japanese
boats, anchoredin its harbor.

Wang has been a student at the
University for the past three and
a half‘ years. Before coming here
he attended Miami University at
Oxford, Ohio, for a. year. ‘He receiv-
ed his early education at Peiping
Academy, China. After graduation,
heis planning to return to China. .
. that is, if international develop-
ments do not cause him to return
sooner.

OF EDUCATIONAL value, aside from its merits as a
German talking picture, is “Danton,” based on the epoch-
making events of the French Revolution in 1793 and th
coming to
Cinema, for ‘the week starting Monday. _

Beginning with scenes within and without the Club
of the Jacobins, of which Danton was president in Jan-
uary, 1793, this latest foreign importation carries through

individuals connected «with it,

the high lights of the revolution.

The picture is said to be marked by some excellent
photography and scenery and features Germany's ﬁnest
thespian, Fritz Kortner, in the title role. He is supported
by Lucie Mannheim and Alexander Granach.

. The Campus
  Scout Says:

, After a. lapse of approximately three weeks the boys about town
,.‘‘*have started to talk about the Pitt basketball team again. The Pitt
cagers were drawing quite a bit of comment from the boys before
 they started on their trip to the coast; but when they failed to win

-all -their games, the interest in them lagged. After Pitt’s defeat at
7 Syracuse and its subsequent losses at the stadium pavilion to Du-
Vfgnuesne and New York U., the interest died out entirely.

f The boys, however, were not to blame for the defeats, and their
record commencing with the first game with Carnegie Tech bears this

 
    
  
  
   
 
    
   

Recently I picked up a copy of the Duquesne Duke, official

student" publication of Duquesne University, and read the com-
-ment of its sports columnist regarding the story on the Pitt-

Duquesne basketball engagement in the Pitt Weekly.

Brother Connor (an “O"’ might be missing) took excep-
tion to the remarks that “the Panthers,,still suffering from
the effects of their long western trip, were unable to ‘maintain
a sustained scoring drive” and that Duquesne “defeated the
worn and weary Panther five.” He thinks that the Weekly is
attempting totake away the glory of the Duquesne victory and
to account for it by‘ the poor condition of the Pitt players.

to Mr. Connor's mistake is that common to most college sports writ-
 The boys can see nothing but thehome team; and when another
‘.66-party suggests that the decisiveness of a victory was partly due to
rgjsome factor other than the playing ability of the two teams, they

‘ f iﬁmedium of a column.
M _  Personally, I don’t care much about what any other college sports
. Q-writer writes about the Pitt Weekly sports section whether it com-
__“;rpli\mentary, or sarcastic, but the fact remains that the majority of the
mg?-boys, who -»live—around, the Perrysville avenue district where I get my

{’a.llowance, and who have longings for“higher education, usually pick

,.g_'Duquesne as their alma mater and read the Duke’s sports section
" with the same zeal that a debutante reads the story of her coming
 out party. I ‘

   

When ‘they read_what tends todiscreclit the sports section
of the'Weekly, they hunt me up and start laying it on thick.
The boys at the house don't consider me a second-rater in this
respect, but when you must face the barrage, from ten boys

l«=wonder if Mr. Connor has ever taken-the following facts

p’re“se_ntjone, Pitt’s basketball teams werecnes which could
come from behindin the last few minutes of play and garner a
victory from what appeared to be certain defeat. -Did the
Iéanthlers do that during the early part of; the present season?

uess ..

1-.

, When a team has such a reputation and has for a nucleus the
ﬂ-three outstanding players of the previousseason, but loses a majority‘
of its games in the ﬁnal few minutes of play, there is only one obvious
*-answer-—too tough a schedule. =
 But what made Pitt come back? Well, the boys were pretty tired
when they came back from the western trip but they had two prac-
tice sessions in as many days before they hopped a train for Syracuse
Whfre they dropped a close ga.me after holding the lead until the

ﬁnal few minutes of play.

 

The boys came home again, practiced two more times, and
‘ ’ were hopelessly out on their feet against Duquesne so Doc
Carlson told the boys that there were no more practice sessions
on the books for the remainder of the week even though New
York U. was to be met that Saturday. ‘
Durin the Thursday and Friday between the Pitt-New
York U. game, Carlson called out some football men who had
had some basketball experience in high school and who were
playing as an independent team to aid his basketball players.
Nobody refused to take the football men seriously with the
resultthat a spirit of levity dominated the game with the Vio- '

, lets. When Pitt lost, the same spirit prevailed, and everybody .
concerned realized that after all a basketball game was just a
basketball game and another defeat~dlcln’t make much differ-»
ence.

I The same spirit carried over to the basketball players. The strain
of attempting to hang up a, string of victories was gone and the boys
were more like themselves. They had also enjoyed a little rest. Then
what happened? Well, Carnegie Tech’ was supposed to be ten points
better than Pitt, but Pitt beat. it, 33-22. And Pitt has won from West
: Virginia and Carnegie Tech a second time.

7 I know you have read this thoroughly, brother Connor, and I hope
you aren’t sore. Just to be even, why not print this in your next col-
-umn? » Perhaps, you think that Duquesne could beat George Washington
U. if the two teams played in Pittsburgh; and if the Dukes don't go so

_ well tonight and tomorrow night in New York, they might have done
. better if they hadn’t had to play four games in as many days. .I hope
A we're still pals. I

Boxers Face
Orange Team
At Syracuse

New York School Holds
Enviable Place In
Collegiate Field

O

Greatly encouraged by their un-
expected 4-3 victory over the West
Virginia maulers last Friday night,
the Pitt boxers leave tonight for
Syracuse where they _ will meet
Orangemen in a dual meet.

Despite the fine showing the
Panthers made against the Moun-
taineers, they will be the under-
dogs when they enter the ring to-
morrow-night. Syracuse has long
held a reputation as one of the
most powerful squads in the East,
and last year handed Spike Webb's
team from‘Navy thefirst -loss the
Midshipmen have suffered in six
years. This will be the first meet
of the season for the Orange, but
there is 1_ittle reason to believe
that_the New -Yorkers are any
weaker this year than last.

Lineup Unchanged
'Titt willprobably line up tomor-

row night in the same order that
it did against West -Virginia. The
115 pound representative for Pitt
is still unknown and unless Coach
Joe Or-sini makes some last min-
ute switch in arrangement, Pitt
will probably forfeit the bout. If
Pitt does furnish a boxer at the
weight, he will meet either Dom-
inador Pascua or Ray Burkett,
with the latter the more likely op-
ponent. . ,

Harry Contijone of Pitt’s best,
will handle the 125 pound weight
class duiies. His opponent will be
Al Wertheimer, captain of the Or-
ange and -eastern -intercollegiate
champion in 1931. Marius Santico-
la and Mario Rubbo, Panther fight
ers in the 135 and 145 pound class-
es respectively, will buck up
against Harry Wolanin and Herb
Ross. Wolanin is a member of a
family of boxers, his brother
Steve being a professional. .

Jack Schricker, who has compil-
ed a brilliant record_ this season,
will meet Joe Bruno, and he is
the lone Pitt man who will be fav-
ored towin his bout. The Carrick
boy made a fine comeback in his
bout with Latham of West Virginia
last week, copping the decision
even though a. right hand blow to
his chin had him groggy during
the greater part of the fight.

Gridmen Tangle

Duke Siegel, Pitt’s versatile
cowboy, hogcaller, announcer, foot-
ball player and boxer faces the
toughest assignment of any Pitt
man in Joe Moran, star of the Syr-
acuse team, who boasts of an im-
pressive string of knockout victor-
ies. The boys met once before but
that was on the football gridiron
in 1930. Moran is a regular half-
back on the Orange grid team.
Their bout is expected to end in
a knockout, both boys being hard
punchers although a little short on
boxing ability. I _

Warren Heller, who has dodged
many of the best ends in the coun-
try in his role as a halfback, will
come face to face with Al Glutz-
man, who plays an end on the Syr-
acuse eleven. These boys also met
before on the gridiron. This bout
will ‘be Heller’s first.

On Friday of next week the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh swimming
team will meet the strong Dela-
ware University swimming aggre-‘
gation. Deleware, as well as Pitt,
is a member of the Eastern Inter-
collegiate Swimming , Association.

Meet Wooster

The varsity met the .Wooster
College Natators at Wooster, Ohio,
yesterday. Due to the fact that
Carnegie Tech beat Wooster hand-
ily, the outcome of this meet’ will
determine Pitt’s chances in the

city contest.

In two meets held so far this
season, the freshman‘ swimming
team managed to split even. The

yearlings romped off to ‘an easy;

victory against Schenley High. In '

the other meet held at MGPCCTS1;
burg ‘Academy, the freshman team?
was defeated. Although the Acad-:
emy team won handidly the repu-
tation of the local team did not
suffer for Mercersburg boasts of
one of the outstanding teams of
its class. In this meet Fred War-
ren was the only Pitt man to win
a first place; he ran off with the
220.
Jones Joins Frosh

With the addition of Joe Jones
into the freshman ranks, the year-
ling team will be strengthened
greatly. vdones hails from Canton,
Ohio, where his swimming abili-
ties were highly respected. Alrea-
dy he has unofficially lowered the
back-stroke record for the Trees
pool by a little less than two sec-
onds. Pat Corr is expecting great
things of him when he is initiated
into the ranks of the varsity.

Star, Leading Scorer
Among Irish Players

’ Fresh from a decisive victory over the highly-vaunted Car-
negie Tech quintet on its own floor and with its star, J agnow,
in the lineup, Doc Car1son’s Golden Panthers are out to give
Notre Dame ﬂoormen a real battle tomorrow night at .the.Sta-
Revenge will be the aim of Carlson’s greatly-
improved passers, for the Irish lads defeated the Panthers 25-

 

their stride, their class in the
West Virginia and Tech battles
being more of the calibre of
Pa.nther aggregations of former
years. Docky Kowallis and Timmy
Lawry, diminutive Panther for-
wards and co-captains, along with
the ever-reliable ‘Don Smith have
been hitting the cords with regu-
larity, while the return of Ochseu-
hirt to playing shape adds
strength to the pivot.
Brown Comes Through.

J ohnny-On-The-Spot Brown, ﬂash-
ing high~c1ass form in his last year
under Carlson, has been a life-
saver during the past few weeks;
and with two strong centers to
place in action, Carlson looks for-
ward to the next few weeks with
a brighter outlook.

Saturday night ﬁnds the Golden
Panthers pitted against one of the
outstanding ﬂoor quintets in the
countrylin George Ke_ogan’s Notre
Dame ﬁve. Since 1927 the Irish
have come to the stadium favored
to conquer the local -passers, but
each time Carlson's boys have
managed to win out in the last
few minutes of play. Every year
except 1930 the ﬁnal outcome has
been in-doubt until the last whis-
tle blew, and the coming battle
should be no exception.

Crowe On Bench.

Leading the South Bend ﬂoormen
into action will be All-America Ed
Krause, sensational football star.
Although but a sophomore, Krause
has captured a regular berth and
leads the Irish scorers. Newbold
and DeCook, both veterans will
occupy_ the forward positions, while

Captain Norb Crowei another of

athletic fame, and whom loca fol-

—-or a calm, relaxing, restful smoke.
The hunter's smoke, the ﬁsherman’s
smoke, the engineer's smoke———a man’s
smoke, through and through.

And pipe smokers who know their
fine tobaccos tell you there’s no blend

The prominence of the Pitt
Graduate School, has therefore,
 become nation-wide. The rec-

ord is a, ﬁne testimonial to the
high standards of the entire

University.

The estimate that these stu-
dents from other colleges and
other sections of the country
have formed of Pitt is worth
I the consideration of Pittsburgh-
ers who, because of proximity,
have perhaps not been able to
appraise the University at its
true value, as an educational

center.

Spring Festival

 

UST HOW THE Spring Fes-
tiva1 will be ﬁnanced this
year with a balance of only
$5.51 in the Senior Class treas-
ury is the question that is
puzzling Walter Rome, gradu-
ate manager of student activi-
ties.

This event, which was inaug-
urated last year with unusual
success was ﬁnanced largely by
funds taken from the treasury
of the graduating class. But
where last year's Senior class
had a surplus of more than
$250 upon which to draw, there
remains the rather insigniﬁcant
sum of $5.51 in the coffers of
the present Seniors.

It would be unfortunate if
the Festival should have to be ‘
abandoned, but that is the I
only course if funds are not
forthcoming from some source
as yet unsuspected. A Spring
Festival with its colorful events
in which all students take part
is something more than just a.
sentimental collegiate gesture.
It is hoped that a means will
be found to make the continu-
ance of the event a possibility.

Ex-Students Safe On Cruise

Injury As Launch Burns;

 

Abandon Expedition, Return Home

I

Two former students of the University of Pittsburgh saw
their dreams of a year’s cruise in Central American waters
vanish in the smoke of the launch “Quest,” as the Pan-Amen
'ican Expedition boat burned to the waterline last Thursday, at

_ Baton Rouge, La.

Edward B. Foote and Edward T. Jones, the former Pitt
students, escaped injury when a faulty gasoline stove exploded.

Jones, who
Wright, Rutgers, and Stanley Ste-

phens of Pittsburgh, was aboard at
the time, was forced to swim
ashore. His companions received

slight burns while diving from the
launch.

The other members of the expe-
dition, Mortimer B. Sheppard, di-
rector and guide, and Foote, were
ashore at the time of the accident.
::They returned in time to direct
the efforts made to save the equip-
ment, but nothing wa salvaged.
The loss was estimated t $14,000;
including $4,000 worth of cameras.

The party, upon checking the
ﬁnances, found just enough to en-
able a return to this city.

The expedition, which sailed two
months ago, was to have spent a
year in the Central American dis-
trict gathering scientific and soci-
ological material. Foote was the
cameraman for the venture, and
was commissioned to bring back
photographs of the Mayan ruins
for the University. The expedi-
tion, however, was not officially
connected with the University of
Pittsburgh, but was privately
ﬁnanced.

University of Pittsburgh—We
have heard so many different
things about college people that we
are almost beginning to believe

them. But Jean Harlow, the girl
with the metallic tresses, said
while visiting the smoky city, “I
think college boys and girls are
just grand. I like their youth and
their vitality and also their pleas-
ing ways.” Buddy Rogers, also a
recent Pittsburgh visitor, main-
tained, “You can always pick out
college students by their gentle-
fnztmly ways. They are a genuine

EHESSMEN IIIINTINIIE WIN

Since the world's sweetest girl moved to Van-
dersburgh I have formed a bad habit. I long to
go to Vandersburgh. That is my habit. Be-
tween semesters I had couched me down with a
copy of “The Rover Boys at College,” leaving
the world of drab femininity ‘for red .blooded
Americanism. Alas! I could not get away from
it all; I could not read. My darling’s face
haunted me. I was so haunted that Eugene
O'Neill got an idea for a new trilogy. O'Neill
had just dropped in to ﬁre a few shots at papa.

Suddenly I was alive with emotion! My eyes
gasped; a. tear. trickled‘ down my breath! I
would see my sweetheart! * I would ‘go. to Van-
dersburgh! In a jiffy I was swathed in my pur-
ple surtout, be-spatted, and a brown bowler
tilted devilishly over my left ear, the pink ear
that everyone wants to kiss. I lighted a cheroot,
and tucked my jeweled hands into my home-
spun mittens. , Mother knitted them. You know
the kind that are connected with a piece of
string that runs around the back of your neck.
VVarmth is the thing——-no frills or gingerbread
for us wholesome Germans. “Adios, madam ma
mere; hasta manana, shicksa,” I tossed off in
the tongue of my Hapsburg forefathers. And
jumped into my motor runabout. Zip! My foot
pressed the petrol lever, and I was of! in the
night for Vaniiersbprgh ‘and mine own true love.

Vandersburgh is one of those hamlets where
the bureau of public safety is certainly a ﬁne
fellow. He carries a bucket on one arm in case
of ﬁre, a Civil War musket in case of riot, and
a tin cup in case of emergency. It is infre-
quent that he is called upon to use the musket
or bucket.

Vandersburgh’s male inhabitants spend their
days hunting red Indians while the women
pound maize. Their diligence is amazing. ‘The
little girls make samplers and crochet ferris-
waists. The little boys practice taxidermy;
stuffing weasels, chipmunks, snipe, and ballot
boxes. , i

There are two roads leading to Vandersburgh
—the ﬁrst has not been built——-the second has
not been ﬁnished. This I discovered in no time
at all, being very apt with ﬁgures. Wlieeeeeel
I sailed along road number two. And talking
about speed—-20 or even 25 miles an hour means
absolutely nothing to me. In fact I have often
been called a speed demon. Whoopeeee! The

wind blew back my hair, and the romance of
night was in my veins. Suddenly kerplub!
kerplub! I was bouncing over a shell torn bat-
tlefield. No, I was still on the road, but as I
looked ahead the road surface looked as though
someone had turned twelve or fourteen coal
mines inside out and piled them in the road.
And lighted a few rods of dynamite for atmos-
phere. Smash! An extra deep rut, and I bit
my lip as I came down. My face began to feel
like one of those Ubangi women; you know, the
ones with the dinner-plate mouths.

Off once more to Vandersburgh to see my
light of love. One flat tire was changed, and a
spare tire bore its share of my hurtling craft.
Of a sudden something began to choke and sput-
ter; something way up front where the crank
begins. It hissed, gurgled, and then death-
I allghted, whirled
the crank until a farmer passing by yelled,
“Say thar, young feller, what are ye tryin’ to do
with that air windmill?” I turned on my heel
and stuck out my tongue at him. The whipper-

Alternately I ﬁled the d1'stn'bu'tcr points,
ground the valves, tightened all the nuts and
bolts, and even cleaned the‘ windshield. But no
power. I planted my foot on the running board
and bounced. Still no power. I dismantled the
gas line and blew through it. I crawled under
and twisted and hammered all the thfngumbobs
I could ﬁnd. , >

Finally, in disgust, I threw the tire“ pump at
the windshield and set off on foot to Va;tIders-
burgh and my sweet dear.

Footsore, weary, and dirty I arrived‘ in Van-

shuﬂied to‘ my swe‘et"s house, and rang‘ the bell.
The maid answered, “Oh, Miss Mary,” she said,
“Miss Mary went to a dance with her boy‘ friend
this evening. They are in Pittsburghz”

I felt so small I could have hid behind am
Austin. I turned to leave. Surprise of surpri’ses'~..
There came my runabout speeding up the street’.
Driving one-armed was a handsome lad with!
his other arm around’ my light of love. “Lucky;

when our car broke down, all we needed was a;
