Jarvik—7 
recipient
receives new
human heart”

By Susan Washburn
The Pitt News

Thomas Gaidosh, the ﬁrst person to
receive an artiﬁcial heart in Pittsburgh,
remains in critical condition following
transplant surgery that replaced the
Jarvik-7 heart with a human heart.

Gaidosh, 47, suffered from a virus
that weakenedrhis heart muscles. After
waiting two weeks for a human heart,
the Jarvik-7 was implanted five days
ago when Gaidosh’s. heart became too

weak to support him. The Jarvik-7 was ’

replaced with a human heart at
Presbyterian-University Hospital by
Dr. Baitley Griffith in a three-and—a-
half-hour operation on Monday.

According to a Miami Valley
Hospital spokesman, the heart donor
was James Randall Reige of West
Alexandria, Ohio. Reige died Sunday
as the result of an auto accident.

_ Finding a suitable donor for Gaidosh
was difficult because of his size and
blood type. Gaidosh was reported as
weighing, at times, 220 pounds and
having blood type 0. Doctors were
searching for a donor weighing around
200 pounds. Reige weighed 190
pounds which was within a suitable
range to make the transplant possible.

Last year, Presbyterian-University

‘ Hospital completed approximately 50

human heart transplants. However,
Gaidosh is the first in Pittsburgh to be
sustained by the J arvik-7 until a suitable
donor was found.

Presby OKs
multi—organ
transplant

(UPI) —- Pitt’s Institutional Review
Board for Biomedical Research ap-
proved Monday a multi—organ
transplant which will be performed at
Presbyterian-University Hospital.

The surgery will include the
transplant of the patient’s intestines,
liver, pancreas, spleen and stomach.
World renowned transplant surgeon
Dr. Thomas Starzl will supervise the
transplant surgery.

Herbert Zeal, of Pekin, Indiana, has
been suffering from a series of
disorders that have resulted in liver
failure and the loss of his intestines. His
problems began four years ago when
he developed inﬂammation and ulcers
of the colon and rectum. His problems
grew more serious, however, when the
small intestine’s blood supply was cut
off as a result of the damage to the main
artery that serves it. . »

The transplant operation will be per
formed -when a suitable donor is
located. ‘ . A =

SGB presidental candidate decides

to drop out of upcoming election    

By John Zaphyr

Staff Writer

Bob Kramer, Student Government
Board presidential candidate, withdrew
his nomination from this year’s elec-
tion last Friday. His decision was based
on personal reasons.

“I’ve been involved in SGB for three
years and just thought it was time to
concentrate on academics,” Kramer
said. “It was a personal decision.”

Kramer informed the SGB through
a letter sent to Student Government
Election Committee Chairman Linda
Bodner. In the letter, Kramer said his
decision to withdraw was made as a

Starzl receives distinguished service

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer

On Oct. 26 world-renowned_ Pitts-
burgh transplant surgeon Dr. Thomas
E. Starzl received the Pennsylvania
Medical Society’s Distinguished Ser-

vice Award. He received the award in"

a ceremony during the society’s annual
business meeting in Philadelphia. Starzl
is the 11th recipient of this award,
which was first presented to Dr. Jonas
Salk in 1956. p

The Distinguished Service Award,
the highest award given‘ to a member
of PMS, is given in recognition of a
career so exemplary as to be a model
for the profession.

.“‘The award is not given com--

  

“I wouldlhave liked to have been chosen SGB presi-
dent, but I have my studies to be concerned with. ”

“result of many hours of questioning
my own motives and aspirations.”
“I feel it would be better to step out
of the race now and give the other two
candidates the full attention that their
campaigns deserve,” said Kramer.
Bodner took the news in stride. “It
was his choice,” she said. “It won’t

cause us any major problems — we’ll
just have to change the ballot to include
only two names. And we?re still going
on with the campaign. We still have our
other two candidates.”

The two remaining presidential can-V

didates, Jim Mumma and Dan Taylor,
had no comment on the situation.

“The award is not given competitively. It is given every
year or every other year to the most outstanding individual

petitively,” said Arnold Cushner of the
PMS. “It is given every year or every
other year to the most outstanding in-
dividual in the field.”

Starzl has achieved this honor by ex- _

panding the art of medicine through his
contributions to the field of organ
transplants, particularly liver
transplants. His most distinguished

_ work has been his establishment of the

successful liver transplant program at

Presbyterian-University Hospital and

Children’s Hospital of ‘Pittsburgh.
The program, which has offered- new

  

life to patients previously beyond the
help of medicine, established Starzl as
a physician of international stature.
Starzl, a professor of surgery at the
University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine, performed the first suc-
cessful liver transplant in 1967 and has
done nearly half of the transplants per-
formed since. '

- Moreover, it is estimated that 90 per-

cent of surgeons doing liver transplants’

nationally were trained by Starzl. In
1984, Starzl performed the world’s

V first successful heart-liver transplant.

“I have no regrets,” Kramer said.
“I would have liked to have been
chosen SGB president, but I have my
studies to be concerned with, and I
think this decision was best for me per-
sonally. I had good intentions, but I
think it is best that I bow out now.”

Kramer looked positively at his time 7

spent as an SGB member. “I had three
good years in SGB,” he said. “It was
a good learning experience.”

Kramer said he is not sure what ef-
fect his withdrawal will have on the
election. “It’s hard to tell,” he said.
“Ivthink both [Mumma and Taylor] are
good candidates, and it will be a good
race.”

award

Starzl was born and raised in. Le
Mars, Iowa, and received his
bachelor’s degree from Westminster
College in Fulton, Mo. Starzl’s post-
graduate training included an internship
and residencies at ‘John Hopkins
University, the University of Miami
School of Medicine and the Veterans
Administration Research Hospital in

Chicago. He is board-certiﬁed by both‘. A

the American Board of Surgery and
American Board of Thoracic Surgery.

In addition to his pioneering surgical
accomplishments, Starzl has authored

French researche

PARIS — Researchers in France
think they've found a drug that may be
to AIDS victims what insulin is to

' diabetes victims.

Three researchers from Laennec
Hospital, Jean-Marie Andrieu, Philippe
Even and Alain Venet, talked about
their discovery at a news conference in
Paris yesterday.

They said the drug cyclosporine-A
has kept alive two AIDS patients who

_ likely would have succumbed to the .

deadly virus without it. The drug is
commonly used on transplant patients
to prevent rejection of newly implanted
organs.

In the case of one AIDS patient, the
French team said the disease was
stopped from progressing. The
researchers said that is the ﬁrst time
that has ever happened.

' The drug is not a cure for AIDS, but
the researchers said they have hope it
can be used to control the AIDS virus,
just as insulin controls diabetes.

They said more research is needed
to determine just how good the ‘drug is
against AIDS, which attacks the body’s
ability to ward off disease.

In related news, officials in
Greenland have launched a campaign
to ﬁnd out how many people on the
world’s largest island may have AIDS.
The ﬁrst sign of AIDS on the arctic na-
tion turned up two months ago. The af-

,,ﬂicted Greenlander did not have AIDS,

but tests showed he had been exposed
to it.

Challenger prepares
for German space mission

CAPE CANAVERAL — The Space
shuttle Challenger is ready to begin a
unique journey today, carrying the
largest crew ever to ﬂy in space ‘on a
week-long spacelabscience mission
paid for by the West German govem-
ment. It is the 22nd shuttle mission, but
for the ﬁrst time, experiments con-
ducted aboard the craft will be directed
by a foreign nation.

West Germany is paying $67 million
for the shuttle’s services. Officials say
three German shuttle missions are
planned as NASA steps up its coopera-
tion with the European Space Agency.

House must balance
budget, Dole says

WASHINGTON — Senate Republican
leader Robert Dole says it’s up to the
House to avert a financial headache for
the government and take a step toward
balancing the federal budget.

The Republican-controlled Senate
already has passed a debt ceiling hike
to enable the government to continue
operating smoothly. Attached to the bill
is a measure that would lead to a
balanced budget in six years.

House members of a conference
panel have doubts about the balanced
budget proposal, but agree with Dole
that something must be done by Friday.
After that, the Treasury says it will
have to do some ﬁnancial juggling to
keep writing checks.

Today, House speaker Tip O’Neill
said he personally opposes the balanced
budget measure but believes it has
enough support to pass anyway. He
said House Democrats are trying to
modify the proposal and urged protec-
tion of programs designed to help the
poor. ' -

Soviet sailor

returned home

A Soviet ofﬁcial says the Russian
sailor who jumped ship near New
Orleans in two apparent attempts to
defect will return to the Soviet Union.
Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin
met with Secretary of State Shultz
yesterday and afterward called the mat-
ter “settled.” The State Department
conﬁrms that the sailor will go home.

Trooper testifies in
MOVE hearing

PHILADELPHIA —— The state
trooper who piloted the helicopter from
which a bomb was dropped on the
MOVE house on May 13 said that im-
mediately after the bombing, he spot-
ted no ﬁre on the roof of the house.

Trooper Richard Reed said he was

not told gasoline was possibly being
stored on the roof, and at the time his
main concern was to protect the
helicopter.

Reed told a special commission in-

vestigating the confrontation, which '

claimed 11 lives, that Lt. Frank
Powell, the head of the city police
department’s bomb squad and the man

“D

who dropped the bomb, said the bomb
fell ﬁve feet away from where he
intendeg.

Reed said after the bomb was
dropped there was a two-foot hole in
the roof, but that a fortiﬁed bunker re-
mained intact. He said he ﬂew over the
house again some 30 minutes later and
saw_ the roof burning and ﬂames on

another roof. He said there was no
water being put on the house at the
time.

The ﬁre grew into a massive blaze
that engulfed 61 houses, leaving 250
people homeless.

sonnel ﬁles, maps- and classiﬁed papers

inside the desks and ﬁling cabinets that

Perspective: Russians attempt

to create new ‘Soviet Man’

By Joe Krzywiecki
Staff Writer

In order to create a uniﬁed Russian
society, the Soviet Union is restricting
the cultural development of the many
nationalities that inhabit its borders, ac-
cording to Bohdan Nahaylo, who spoke
Monday at the University Center for
International Studies.

“Although Gorbachev is now in
charge, he is unliklely to change the
policies set by his predecessors,” said
Nahaylo. “In order to create a new
‘Soviet Man,’ the Russians are at-
tempting to fuse the different na-
tionalities into one national identity.”

Nahaylo, a research assistant with
Radio Liberty in Munich; West Ger-
many, claimed that non—Russian-
speaking Soviets are discriminated
against because of their language and
culture. He said college students in
Georgia, a province in the Soviet
Union, are forced to write dissertations
in Russian if they are to be read. Such
policy, N ahaylo added, causes tension
and feelings of inequality among the
students. .

“They [The Soviet Georgian

students] feel that if they are raised in
Georgia and go to Georgian schools

_ and colleges, they should publish their

own papers in their own languages.”

In the late 1970s and the early ’80s,
Nahaylo said there has been a steady
decline in non—Russian publications.
Nahaylo pointed out that Russian is the
language of social advancement in the
Soviet Union.

The history of “Russiaﬁcation,”
Nahaylo said, dates back to the Soviet
revolution when Lenin wanted to have
one country uniﬁed under one language
and one ideology. Since then, Nahaylo
said, there have been varied attempts
by different Soviet leaders to ac-
complish this goal.

The problem now, said Nahaylo,,is

that the Russian population has fallen A

to 40 percent in the Soviet Union. With
the Turkish province population in-
creasing in the Soviet Union, Nahaylo
predicted that, in the near future, one
out of three Soviet soldiers will have
an Islamic background.

In the early 1970s there was an in-
crease of nationalism in the Ukrainian
province of the Soviet Union due to the
human rights movement in Leningrad
and Moscow. The different na-
tionalities began to coordinate their ac-

tivities, increasing the feeling of pride
and culture of tradition of the
nationalities.

Since then, Nahaylo said, there has
been a crackdown on the nationalism
movement by purging universities and
arresting teachers. “Speaking against
the Russians means 15 years in the
labor camps,” Nahaylo said. “The ma-
jority of the people that inhabit these
camps are non—Russian. ”

N ahaylo went on to say that there is
an increase of anti-Semitism in the
Soviet Union. “They are no longer
allowed immigration status,”he said.
“They are non-persons. It’s a continual
campaign of harassment against
them.”

To increase the use of,the Russian
language, the Soviets have made it a
mandatory language for all students to
learn, once they begin kindergarten,
Nahaylo said. “To promote Russian
ideas and language, teachers are also
given pay raises and other incentives
to encourage their participation in the
program,” he continued. “Non-

_ speaking Russians in the Soviet Union
are being told that they are second class
citizens. Combined with economic in-
equality, the Soviets could be sitting on
a time bomb.”

Lost Joys

At a large, state-funded university such as ours,
it is not expected that the student body will repre-
sent the “best and the brightest’ ’ from among socie-
ty’s youth. By deﬁnition, state-funded universities
are founded and maintained for the “common
man.” Thus, the composition of the student body
will consist of a minority of exceptionally gifted
students and decidedly ill—qualiﬁed students, while
the overwhelming majority will evince a tendency
toward mediocrity.

Mediocrity, in itself, is not an unforgivable atroci-
ty. Whatever the intellectual failings with which an
individual is cursed due to an absence of innate
ability, they can often be conquered through deter-
mination, diligence and fortitude. What is,
however, unpardonable of university level students
is the enfeeblement of the mind through sloth and
indifference.

At the University of Pittsburgh there is far too

much evidence of dull-rninded boorishness. Too
often students come to class unprepared and hung
over. Many students demonstrate little excitement
or interest in learning, and the classroom more
closely resembles a morgue. Commonly, the most
profound concern of students is the whereabouts of
the next party or the state of one’s wardrobe.

What has happened to the eager, inquisitive
mind? For the most part at Pitt, there is no love .
of art. Students do not experience the thrill of scien-
tific discovery. There is no joy to be found in the
exploration of new ideas, concepts and
philosophies. Nor is the acquisition of knowledge
desirable. This is not only unfortunate; it is frighten-
ing as well.

If we are not here for an education, then we are
here for the wrong reasons. If we are not dedicated
to self—improvement through learning, then we are
undeserving of the opportunities afforded us. Let’s
apply that youthful energy and enthusiasm to the
classroom and put an end to the enervation which
results from debauchery and disinterest.

  Letters to the Editor

Farrakhan Issue

Mr. Farrakhan’s advocacy of black
capitalism and self-reliance has found
a. good deal of support. It makes sense.
Hard work, enterprise and innovation
have traditionally led to the advance-
ment of poor minorities in American
history.

Mr. Farrakhan’s message does not
need to invoke bigotry, hate and the
scapegoating of other minorities to spur
the improvement of the economic status
of blacks. This is the road to failure.
The scapegoat takes away the blame,
but it also reduces the determination to
achieve.

When Mr. Farrakhan speaks, we
wonder how laughing at the Holocaust
can possibly serve to get his message
across.

‘ The Legacy
An Organization of
Children of Holocaust Survivors

I wish to comment on the front page
article in the Oct. 16 issue of The Pitt
News, “Trustees address Farrakhan
conﬂict,” by David Zafris.

I’m not completely sure I understand
why it has turned into a controversial
issue. Is it because Mr. Farrakhan’s
remarks are allegedly so hard-hitting,
or is it the “same ole” [story]: another
black who may be able to organize
other blacks?

As is usually the case, when a black
shows any type of leadership,
everything reported is negative, and he
is immediately portrayed as a
troublemaker and militant hate-
monger. There is a great deal to be said
about all the negativity relative .to the
upcoming lecture of Mr. Farrakhan,
and as far as I’m concerned, much of
it is unwarranted and fake.

To futher illustrate the childish minds
of many whites, I vividly remember the
negative, hateful remarks publicized
when Martin Luther King Jr.’s birth-
day became a national holiday. A man
who saw the need for change, and who
was truly a great leader, is considered
by many whites to be the instigator of
the 19605 uprisings. The man is dead,
but the controversy that cropped up was
beyond belief.

I have come to the conclusion that
the consensus among the majority of
whites is “The only good black is a
quiet black."

If all people are interested in learn-
ing, they should keep an open mind

Yippies Archaic

Yippie vs. Yuppie: To me there is
no competition. Who would you rather
be seen with: a person sporting a Pierre
Cardin jacket and driving a BMW or

p a personwearing 10-year-old sneakers

in a beat—up, old Chevy?

Let’s face it, yippies are yesterday’s
generation. The people who used to say
“Don’t trust anyone over 30” now say
“Don’t trust anyone under 35. ” Right.

Their ideology may have been rele-
vant then, but now, two decades later,
yippies are symbolic of an archaic
ideology.

I’m not claiming that yippies did not
have a purpose at one time, or that they
no longer exist in universities. But how
often do they actually make a contribu-
tion to society? And how often have
they made significant accomplish-
ments, other than being glorified by
later generations?

Yuppies are goal—oriented, optimistic
and ambitious. Their fundamental
assertions are directly beneficial to
society, not a false pretense for cam-
pus activism. Yuppies, in‘ their self-
serving efficacy, provide an ascer-
tainable form of aggrandizement for
society, not an indiscriminate destruc-
tion of a long-standing and judicious
political and economic system.

Why even pay Abbie Hoffman and

Gerry Rubin to debate that which is .

undebatable?

Individualism

This is in response to a letter by
Donald P. Frazier (The Pitt News, Oct.
25).

Mr. Frazier, your racism is
repulsive. Human beings must be
judged on an individual basis — and
skin color should be held as totally ir-
relevant in this process.

The self-arrested, tribal and coward-
ly mentality displayed in your letter -
the kind that would think in terms of
“the white man” and “the black man”
—— is the root of racism in South Africa
and the rest of the world.

Mr. Frazier, if you wish to break out
of your self-induced unconsciousness,
you would do well to read “The Other
Side of Racism” by Anne Wortham.
Mrs. Wortham’s message, in essence,
is that the only answer to racism is
individualism.

Feeling Blue

In State College, Pa., last week, a
man was given a “Penn State heart.”
Think about it for a moment. What a
concept! My mind reels at the
possibilities. Just imagine what terri-
ble side effects might happen from put-
ting a “Penn State heart” in a normal
human being.

The first signs of trouble might be
when the patient requests new pajamas
and a new bathrobe — a blue and white
bathrobe. As the doctors lean over him
in the intensive care unit, they may hear
him whispering something; “He seems

to be asking for someone  Joe some-
one  is that his dad?”

Soon all the blue and white would
have the ICU looking more like a PSU
dorm room, but the doctors would pro-
bably draw the line at the blue and
white bandages and bedpans. His out-
of-state visitors would all come out of
his room with the same questions on
their lips: “What’s a Nittany?” A life-
size cardboard cutout of Joe Paterno
dressed in blue" and white -surgical
scrubs would stand in his room 24
hours a day. Things would get worse;
the ﬁrst food he would ask for would
be ice cream from The Creamerv.

Other patients would be kept awake
at night by repeated yells of “We are
Penn State!” and several unprintable
rhyming expressions involving the
word Pitt. A reporter’s question such
as “How are you feeling, sir?” would
be answered, “ Seven and oh! Seven
and oh! Not Pitt, not WVU, not Notre
Dame!” _

I know that bodies are not supposed
to have any reactions to the inert plastic
and steel of the artificial hearts, but I
know if they put a Penn State heart in
me, my body would reject it, and I
would die in short order. Especially as
’Nov. 23 rolled around — aagh! A fate
worse than death! Quick, somebody,
bring me an Iron and some “O” fries!
Help!

The images we see on television and
in magazines communicate things that
shape our thoughts, values and the way
we perceive reality. Those beautiful,
blond-haired and blue-eyed young peo-
ple with chiseled features and ﬂawless
physiques used in commercial adver-
tising now tell us that “we” are up-
wardly mobile, guided by a cut-throat
ambition to achieve “success” — a
predetemiined notion which will enable
us to consume the countless wonder-
ful commodities ﬂashing seductively
before our eyes.

Keeping stride with the success com-
mercial media has had in manipulating
young people, the U.S. military is now
employing very similar images in its

‘ recruitment advertisements: Beautiful

young people are learning exciting
high-tech skills in the military which

will presumably transform them into
the model consumers the commercial
media is portraying.

Whether or not we consciously act
upon the knowledge, we all know that
the images transmitted through com-
mercial media communicate - things
which contradict reality: We are not all
going to “succeed’ ’ and be able to con-
sume those wonderful commodities,
nor are we going to be as beautiful and
“cool” as those supennen and those
female prototypes which are seducing
us. But what of the military? Can we
learn career skills while experiencing
the “adventure” .of military service
which will lead us to future

No. Recently published statistics and
personal accounts shatter the myths
perpetuated by military recruitment
advertising. One study found that on-

ly 12 percent of the men and six per-
cent of the women found the skills they
learned in the military to be valuable
in the civilian job market. The Depart-
ment of Defense ‘itself gave out figures
on actual skilled jobs available in the
military: craftsmen, 3.2 percent; elec-
tronic equipment services, 7.2 percent;
medical specialists, 5.1 percent: other
technical services, 1.9 percent.-In con-
trast, 50 percent of the jobs consist of
general infantry, supply handlers and
administrative support positions.

Comparable statistics for minority-
group members are worse. In the
technical job positions, whites out-
number blacks two to one. Some con-
tend that the “objective” ‘vocational
tests discriminate against low-income
groups disproportionately made up of
minorities.

Commercialism and the Military;Luring America’s Youth

In light of the military’s intense
recruitment drives, which in some in-
stances are more successful than col-
lege recruitment campaigns, the reali-
ty of veteran unemployment rates is
staggering. One job counselor said that
79 percent of his clients claimed to
have gained civilian-related skills in the
military but were, nevertheless, un-
qualiﬁed for civilian employment.

Meanwhile, the Army alone devoted
$73.3 million in 1985 specifically to
recruit adolescents and minority
groups. The Pentagon expects to spend
$178 million this year in veterans’
unemployment benefits, which con-
tinue for a meager 13 weeks after

‘ discharge.

The myths created by commercial
media may be part of an inexorable
trend in American society; delusions of

 

unlimited opportunity and the power of 1
commodity fetishism have been in-
tegral aspects of our culture for
decades. But the myths created by

military recruitment advertising signify ‘
something frighteningly novel: .The ’
military is now learning to capitaliie ‘

on those same cultural forces with
equal success. Just as with the commer-
cial media, the military’s target popula-

tion is young, gullible and plagued by

stupefying unemployment rates. .

Perhaps it is naive to think that the
military as a governmental institution
is accountable for its advertising: But,
as such, it is at least easier to expose

the contradiction between the fantasy . ,
world depicted in its advertising and the ~

world we see when the box gets turned
off‘.

Israeli Strategy Of Force is Inappropriate and Dangerous

Not quite a month ago I sat in an of-
ﬁce in Jerusalem and was told by Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin what
he had been telling others: Jordan
would be making a mistake if it allowed
the Palestine Liberation Organization
to use its territory for either the plan-
ning or the execution of terrorist raids
against Israel. Three weeks later,
Israeli jets bombed PLO headquarters
near Tunis, 1,500 miles away from Jor-
dan. You can bet, though, that J ordan’s
where the blast was supposed to make
the biggest impression.

There are very few things that you
can rely on in the Middle East. One,
cited frequently by the Israelis in a

. patronizing fashion, is that it is irra-
' tional to expect their Arab neighbors

to act rationally. The second is that
almost everything Israel does‘ can
sooner or later be tied to security con-
cerns over the West Bank. The bomb-
ing of PLO headquarters was an exam-

   
 

ple of that. _
Ostensibly, Israel. acted after three of
its citizens were murdered in Cyprus

- by two Palestinians and a man iden-

tified as a Briton. Israel blamed the
murders on the PLO’s Force 17,
members of which comprise Yasser
Arafat’s personal bodyguard. But Israel
does not explain how it comes by its
information since the three are in
Cypriot, not Israeli, custody. And other
than citing the irrationality of Arabs,
it cannot explain why members of an
elite PLO force would simply murder
three ordinary civilians and then per-
mit themselves to be arrested. If it’s a
prisoner swap the Palestinians wanted,
it was a vain hope. Israeli policy does
not permit it. ‘

Inthe end, the Cyprus incident, as
gruesome as it was, may have been the
pretext Israel was seeking for yet
another attempt to bloody the PLO,

. possibly eliminate Arafat once and for

all and, as a bonus, send a clear signal
to Jordan. If that’s the case, it would
not be the first time Israel has done

- such a thing.

In 1982, it “responded” to the
shooting of its ambassador to Britain,
Shlomo Argov, by sending its troops
all the way to Beirut. It turned out that
Argov had not been shot by the PLO.
And it turned out that the then Israeli
defense minister, Ariel Sharon, in-
tended to invade Lebanon all along. He
hoped to finish the PLO once and for
all.

Then, as now, Israel’s concern has
been the West Bank and its 750,000
Palestinian Arabs. The destruction of
the PLO as a military force was sup-
posed to accomplish the destruction of
the PLO as a political force as well.
Then West Bank Arabs would have no
alternative but to accept the moderate
leaders Israel has chosen for them. The
more radical and belligerent PLO

would be out of the picture.

The plan did not work. The PLO,
mauled by the Israeli army and then
dispersed to several Arab countries,
nevertheless persists as a political en-
tity and, by Israeli testimony, a terrorist
one as well.

In the Israeli view, the only thing
worse than the PLO itself would be a
PLO that is allowed to operate from
Jordan. At the moment, that’s not in
the cards. But since its ejection from
Lebanon, King Hussein has permitted
the PLO to open a headquarters in J or-
dan — no more than a stone’s throw
from the West Bank. In his interview,
Rabin said Israeli intelligence knew that
several attempted terrorist operations
had been planned in Jordan. In no
uncertain terms, he said Israel would
not allow that sort of thing to continue.

The Israeli strategy, while harsh, has
the patina of logic to it: You hit your
enemy and those who harbor him. But

if security on the West Bank is the
Israeli concern, then its real enemy is

not the PLO but Palestinian na- '

tionalism. Of the 16 Israelis who have
died in the last year in terrorist attacks,
perhaps a majority were killed by West
Bank Arabs with no apparent link to the
PLO but with a burning hatred for
Israelis. No bombing of the PLO, no
matter where it may be headquartered,
will change that.

Once, the Arab states thought they
could eradicate Jewish nationalism
through force of arms. They failed.
Now it is Israel‘s turn to make the same
mistake. Twice now, it has struck deep
into ‘foreign territory, sending its
soldiers to do what its politicians will
not —- solve the problem of the West
Bank.

‘ For Israel, the problem is neither in
Lebanon nor Tunisia but a lot closer
than that. It can dispose of its problem

, by disposing of the West Bank.

Balancing art with “work”:

Pitt writer-professors Welcome
teaching as order and inspiration

By Mark Kenny

- Staff Writer

The walls of Ed Ochester’s offices
are decorated with Neil Young and
anti-nuclear posters. A manual Royal
typewriter sits on a small table beside
the 45-year-old poet who seems to be
most at ease when speaking through a
haze of cigarette smoke. The tiny room
is made" even smaller by the presence
of a large desk and several file cabinets.
It’s doubtful that there’s room for even
one more bookcase.

The scenario almost too closely fits
the mold of the stereotypical writer, a
reclusive intellectual refusing to accept
the present by clinging to remnants of
the past, a security blanket that was the
1960s. But 

Ochester -himself doesn’t ﬁt the
mold. An instructor at Pitt since 1970,
he currently is an associate professor
of English in the creative writing pro-
gram. His duties include teaching two
to three poetry classes per term at the
graduate and undergraduate levels and
reviewing the manuscripts of Master 0
Fine Arts candidates. ~

In addition to his academic duties,
Ochester is the editor of the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh Press poetry series. He
recently was elected to the board of
directors for the Associated Writing
Program, a national professional
organization of 150 colleges and
universities across the country. He also
is the general editor for the Drue Heinz
Award for short fiction, has published
eight books of his own poetry and is
awaiting the publishing of his latest
work, “Changing the Name to
Ochester. ”

By any standards, Ochester is too
busy to be reclusive. His workaholism
probably would put a yuppie to shame,
and he will only admit, reluctantly, to
a longing for the second coming of th
’60s. '

His reason for that longing, though,
goes a long way toward explaining why
someone like himself would want to be
immersed in academe with all of its
demands which, it seems, would
detract from a writer’s time for more
creative work.

“I’ve always said that I’m waiting
for the era of 1967 to 1970 to come
back again,” he said. “Not that I want
to make too much out of that, but I
think it was a time when people were

willing to try things in the arts. They

I ’ve always said that I ’m waiting for the era of 1967 to
1970 to come back again. Not that I want to make too much
out of that, but I think it was a time when people were will-
ing to try things in the arts  . Students were saying, “Don ’t
tell as what to think, enable us to think. ”

— Ed Ochester

Department of English, Poetry

 

were weighing and evaluating things on
their own. Students were saying,
‘Don’t tell us what to think, enable us
to think.’ ”

Nowadays, that is the feeling that
Ochester tries to bring out in his
students — that same kind of desire to
learn. “Students have to be motivated
to write and learn on their own,” he
said. “I don’t have that syllabus that’s
going to turn everyone into a genius.
I think I’m most useful when I can let
a student go, when I can watch their
ﬂight or motion and help correct its
path.”

The English department at the
University of Pittsburgh currently
employs 12 full-time professors in its

' creative writing program. They teach

courses in poetry, fiction and non-
fiction writing, and all are published
writers within their own areas.

Like Ochester, they are responsible

for several classes per term and for‘

reviewing graduate students’
manuscripts. In addition, they are in-
volved in extracurricular activities such
as conducting writing workshops, giv-
ing readings of their own work and in-
volvement to varying degrees in judg-
ing and reviewing work submitted for
writing contests.

Recent discussions with several of
these writer/teachers give some insight
as to why they have chosen to exist as
both writers and academics‘. For some
of them, one reason is the stability
which a full-time teaching position
lends to their lives and consequently
their writing.

“One reason I teach is to make
money and support myself, which is
not a bad idea,” said Ochester.

Another writer who shares that sen-
timent is Myron Taube. “Very few
people can support themselves on
writing alone,” said Taube, a professor
who has taught at Pitt for the past 19

Y

 

zx

 

years. “It puts bread on the table. It
also keeps me in touch with young peo-
ple. And I do it because it’s fun.”

Keeping in touch, whether it be with
students or with the activities surround-
ing an academic writing environment,
seems to be a universal reason for the
professors’ wanting to teach. They sug-
gest that it’s a way to evaluate their
own writing and to keep it current by
dealing with writing and students on a
daily basis.

Lewis “Buddy” Nordan is an assis-
tant professor of English and teaches
fiction. He’s published one collection
of his short stories already, and the self-
professed “Mississippi cracker-barrel
storyteller” is in the process of hav-
ing a _second collection published.

“Teaching gives me order in my
life,” said Nordan. “Forseven years,
I was a writer who did not teach, and
I became very isolated and limited. I
was doing literary odd jobs, but I was
spinning webs out of myself like a
spider. I had very little human contact.
Teaching gives that to me. It gives me
what I need as a writer.”

Like Nordan, others agree that
there’s an interactive benefit to be
gained from writing and teaching. “I’m
teaching what I do and that’s very nice,
but if I’m not writing then I feel that
I have nothing to teach,” said Eve
Shelnutt, an associate professor and fic-
tion writer/teacher who has published
several books of fiction and one book
of poetry.

Others realize the benefits of both
jobs in another manner. “After a
while, you feel like a juggler and that
you’re juggling all the time and trying
to keep all the balls going at once,”
said Ochester. “Most of what I do is
exhilarating and exciting. I think that
process gives something back to you;
it replenishes you.” ,

Don’t writing and teaching eventual-

 

mp... Beat   

Poet Ed Ochester

ly begin to detract from one another?
“Yeah,” said Taube, with a shrug,
“teaching interferes, but so what? You

don’t get as much time for writing, but A

life is full of compromises. I’m essen-
tially being paid to teach, so I should
do the best teaching I can.”

Nordan said that there is little distinc-
tion between the two fields. “In order
to be one, I have to be the other,” he
said. “The two are heavily dependent
"on each other.” V

Shelnutt said that personally she
prefers to keep them separate from one
another. “Everybody who writes wants
more time,” she said, “but there’s a
life’s workl want to get accomplished,
so I just do it. But I’ve got to forget
about my own work and concentrate on
my students’ when I’m teaching.”

' Whatever their backgrounds or
reasons for wanting to teach, it’s ap-
parent that these instructors all bring
personal experience, motivation and
energy to their classrooms. It’s that
same energy that they try to tap into
and bring out of their students.

“I try to wake them up, to sensitize
them to what’s taking place around
them,” said Taube.

Dave Hooker/ The Pitt News

“I think writing’s just as hard for me
as it is for a student,” Shelnutt said.
“I’m very concerned that I keep
writing, and I think that kind of inten-
sity spills over into my students.”

Whether it’s intensity or, as Nordan
describes it, a sense of comradship
which the instructors share with their
students, the benefits seem to abound
for all concerned. _

Though no one can predict for sure

if or when there will be a repeat of the‘

1967 to 1970 era, it’s probably true that
it won’t matter as long as students con-
tinue to have access to practicing
writers who teach.

“I don’t‘think students today are
spiritless,” said Ochester. “They’re
saying the same things they did 20
years ago; they have a need to express

themselves. They just have to be more ,,
aware of the nuances of things taking

place around them. You’ve got to be
motivated . You have to marshal your
time.

“My own myth about myself is that-
I’m giving a lot of myself, of my per-
sonality,” he said, “What I like to
think is that when a student needs me,
I’ll be there.” '

Student by day . . . stripper by night  

By Kelly I. Shaffer

Assistant Features Editor

By day he is Michael, a 24-year-old
Pitt public administration graduate stu-
dent, wearing gray sweat pants and an
Air Force t-shirt, walking across cam-
pus unnoticed.

By night he is “Sly” wearing a form-

, ﬁtting Tarzan suit, ﬂexing his muscles

to the screams of a smokey lounge full
of women.

It is not the usual way, but for
Michael, performing as a male dancer
is a way to work through‘ college. He
dances for all—male, exotic dance
groups such as the Steel City Flash
Dancers, Room Service and Sensa-
tions. “Sly” is also available as a solo
act for birthday and bachelorette par-
ties, as well as dancing deliveries and
telegrams.

His costumes include a police
uniform taken off to the rhythm of “No
Parking On The Dance Floor,” a
baseball uniform removed to “Take
Me To The Ballgame” by Bruce
Springsteen, the traditional tuxedo out-
ﬁt and, of course, the Tarzan costume.

“They really go crazy for the Tar-
zan routine,” stated Michael with his
“Sly” smile. “The girls at the clubs

will scream ‘Tarzan, Tarzan’ until I‘

ﬁnally go into it. A banana is utilized
during the act and offered to the

delirious women.

“It’s kind of an ego trip — ‘you
came here just to see me! ’ ” explained
Michael.

However much he enjoys it, the main
reason Michael dances is the money.
For private parties, he charges between
$35 and $65. When he dances at a club
such as the V.I.P., Michael makes
around $200. “I make between $1000
and $1500 a month. Itpays for my
schooling, expenses and gas for my
motorcycle,” he explained.

And there are tips. “Women are
always waving bills, mostly ﬁves and
ones,” Michael said. “Sometimes I
kiss the tipper on the cheek or sit on
their lap — they love it! You learn to
dance and look for the money.”

When he started dancing a year ago,
Michael was excited about every job.
‘.‘[Now],” he said, “I have to get
psyched up for each job — for each au-
dience. You don’t want to disappoint
them. Sometimes it seems like a real

. effort.”

Michael also lifts weights six days a
week for two hours at a time. He
doesn’t have much time for other ac-
tivities. “I really don’t have time to
date or go out,” stated Michael. “I
don’t drink, but I’d like to go to a dance
and mingle, if I had the free time.”
Presently, Michael is spending a lot of
time preparing to defend his master’s
thesis next month.

‘ The Pitt ‘News’, October 30, 1985

On Wednesday last week, Michael
went to his night class and left at 7:30
for a birthday party in Churchill. At 9
p.m., he had to be at the Foggy Bot-
tom; then, at 12:30 a.m., he danced at
a frat party.

“You get so involved in the
business, you let everything else slip,”
said Michael. “You’re constantly
thinking of how to improve your
routine, how to ﬁt in more jobs to get
an extra buck. Sometimes I have to
leave class early to get to a job.”

Exotic dancing, it seems, is quite
competitive. Michael started his own
group, Sensations, recently and has
them booked around Pittsburgh. “We
had this job conﬁrmed two weeks in
advance,” he said. “A week later, the
club called to cancel. Some other dance
group went and offered to dance there
for less money. The business can be
really cut—throat.”

The Penn Hills native wrestled and
played football during high school, and
he wrestled at Lock Haven Universi-

ty, where he graduated with a"

bachelor’s degree in political science.
Here in Pittsburgh, he is involved in
natural body—building competitions‘, a
type of body building which involves
muscle tone development without the
use _of steroids. Michael said he feels
that body building “increases the
ﬂuidity of my~dance routines.”

The ..Pitt,. News, October. 30,. 1985

Stripper-

conlinued from page 8
Michael started dancing a year ago
after being an agency representative
while modeling men’s -fashions at
Kasons. The agency told him to go to
Gloria’s on Route 30 for a tryout. “I
wore black leather pants and jacket,
sunglasses and gloves,” said Michael.
“I was nervous and embarrassed. Now
I’m not embarrassed; I’m really into
working the audience, getting them
crazy.”

“The younger girls really scream"

and yell,” he continued, “but they
don’t tip. It’s the older women who
wave the $5 and $10 bills.” .

Michael said that exotic dancing has
changed his attitude towards women.
“You get the feeling that every woman
is out for one thing. It’s like the role
reversal; women are really aggressive.
They have some great lines — my dad-
dy has a car dealership and ... You can
really get a bad attitude about women.
I feel that women like the macho — the
audience likes the muscular ‘Here I am’
look. The women treat you like an ob-
ject — can they touch? Even my sister
thinks I’m a sleaze.”

It’s not only the women who worry
Michael. Once when he was to dance
at a private party, he was met at the
door by the hostess’ boyfriend who
wouldn’t let him in. “I told him that
I had been sent by the agency just to
dance. After a while he let me in but
not willingly,” laughed Michael.

It seems that despite some problems,
Michael will continue to dance, at least
while he’s still in school. .“I don’t
know how long I’ll keep on dancing,”
stated Michael. “The money is great,
but it makes you very self-centered. It’s
fun — I’ll miss it.”

He saves all his clippings, adver-

_ tisements and pictures. “I’ll show them
to my kids someday,” Michael said.
“I’ll tell them not to do it, but I won’t
hide the fact that I was a male dancer.”

Pitt’s 1985 Semester at Sea voyagers.

Semester at Sea 1985 is ready to sail

By Colleen Collura
For The Pitt News

“It’s a total learning experience.” —
Tamara Maul

‘ ‘We won’t give you a million bucks;
we will give you a million dollars of
experience.” — John Tymtz

“It’s like the pieces of a puzzle. It
all adds up to one big ‘wow.’ ”
Donna Green

Donna Green and Tamara Maul are
alumni of it. John Tymtz is the ex"-
ecutive director of it. During the winter
and spring semesters 12 to 15 Pitt
students experience it. What is it? The
Semester at Sea.

Four hundred ﬁfty college students
will sail from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
on Jan. 27. They will be participating
in “a unique learning experience” on-
board the S.S. Universe.

The S.S. Universe is the ﬂoating
campus of the Semester at Sea pro-

._ gram. During the spring and winter
semesters the S.S. Universe travels to

about 12 different ports. The. ship
departs from Florida during the winter
term and from_ Washington in spring.
Each journey exposes the students to
four major civilizations while relating

them to their classes. For example, if _

a student is taking one of the theater
coursesoffered, he may be asked to see
a theatrical production in each port as
part of the required field work. About
20 percent of each class is ﬁeld work,
which allows students a chance to ‘ ‘see
more than others and experience what
is happening.”

The classes are oriented mostly
toward liberal arts and range from
marine biology to acting. Class size is
usually under 30, and most of the facul-
ty and staff have an international

    

background. The classes are closely
related to the ﬁeld experience gained
in each country.

The ship itself is home for the
students for the entire semester. The
S.S. Universe is equipped with
classrooms, laboratories, audio-visual
equipment, a theater, student union,
swimming pool, hospital, darkroom,
bookstore and sport and sun decks.
Although there are many activities on-
board ship there are disadvantages.
Harry Kunselman explained, “It is
hard to ﬁnd a place to be alone. You
can’t just go for a walk.” But there

‘seemed to be little claustrophobia

aboard because as Kunselman said, “it
is a college campus. Just like at a small
college, there are always new people
‘to meet and things to do.”

All the students interviewed agreed
on one thing: They would all go again.
Some of their assessments of the

voyage included: “A once in a lifetime
experience.” “The friends made on it
are for life.” “After the trip, students
are less afraid of the world and know
what they can do.”

The cost of the Semester at Sea
voyage can be over $9,000, but there
are many ways to fund the voyage.
Because the University of Pittsburgh
sponsors the program, Pitt students are
eligible for a scholarship which may
reduce the costs of tuition, room and
board by half.

There are three scholarships
available. Four to seven students ap-

ply for the scholarships each semester. -

The Pitt scholarships are based most-
ly on academic achievement but there
are 25 work/study scholarships which
also reduce the tuition and room and
board by half. The work/study scholar-
ships are based solely on need and are
available from the Seawise Foundation,
which is the shipping line for the S.S.
Universe. All grants and loans, such
as Pell and PHEAA, can be applied to
the cost of the voyage. It is possible to
pay as much on board the S.S.
Universe as you would while living in
the dorms and attending Pitt.

Students from 120 different schools
participate in the Semester at Sea pro-
gram. Twelve to 15 of those students
are usually from Pitt. Most are
sophomores or juniors. To apply, a stu-
dent must be enrolled in a degree pro-
gram and have completed at least 12
units of credit. The student must have
a QPA of 2.5 for automatic admission.
Students with QPAS between 2.0 and
2.5 are reviewed on an individual basis.
Those who would like to apply should
contact the Semester at Sea ofﬁce,
2E24 Forbes Quad, or call 624-6021.

Injuries, inexperience
hampering passing game  

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor
John Congemi will start at‘quarter—

back this Saturday for Pitt when the
Panthers host Syracuse at Pitt Stadium.

David Woodley will start at quarter—.

back for the Steelers» this weekend
when they host the Cleveland Browns
at Three Rivers Stadium. .
_ If New.York is the city thatnever
sleeps, Philadelphia‘ is the City of
Brotherly Love and Hollywood is the
city of lights, then Pittsburgh must be
the city of quarterback controversies.

Yes, that is the truth. Pittsburgh fans
began debating who should play
quarterback last weekend, both here at
Pitt and also with the Steelers. It has
reached the point where a Pittsburgh
daily newspaper ran a clipout coupon
where the fan can select either David
Woodley or Scott Campbell as the
Steeler starting quarterback and mail
it in to the publication. This all goes
on despite reassurance by head coach
Chuck Noll _that Woodley would start.

Well, the fever swept from Steeler
fans to Panther fans, many of whom
are now calling for the head, or should
we say arm, of John Congemi, in favor
of Joe Felitsky. '

“I do not know what the fans are
saying or thinking," Pitt head coach
Foge Fazio said yesterday. “Some-
times the problem is not always with
the quarterback.’_j

That seems to be true here. Con-
gemi, although not perceived as being
as sharp as he was last year, has com-
pleted 52 percent of the passes he has
attempted. .

When you consider that Congemi has
dealt with four different tight ends,

seven different split ends and SIX dif— I

ferent running backs, those statistics
are not too bad.

While thinking about that, add the
fact that Congemi has lost Matt Sten-
nett, his starting split end, and Dave
Shuck, his potential starting tight end,

both to broken collarboncs. For periods ‘

of close to two weeks, he lost tailback

Charles Gladman to rib problems, split -

end Mike Stewart to an arm injury and
tight end Clint Wilson to a leg injury.
For almost four weeks, Congemi lost
tailback Brian Davis to assorted in‘-
juries. And he lost running back A.B.
‘crown to a team to be named later.

It is quite evident. Having Congemi
complete passes to 14different players
was not the master plan entering the
season.

“I hate to use injuries as an excuse,”
said Fazio. “We are greatly disap-
pointed in our performance and the
results.”

The obvious results have been three
losses and a tie. The more discreet
results may have a more damaging
long-term effect. Fazio has had to use
several players whom he had planned
on redshirting. Freshman split end‘
Reggie Williams was wearing red un-
til others’ injuries forced him intoav _
tion three weeks ago. He has caught_
ﬁve passes for 76 yards, with his red-
shirt hanging in the closet. Another ex-
ample is freshman Michael Hadley,
who was targeted to sit this year out

but played last weekend against Navy).
The inexperience has shown, as the
younger players have had a baptism
under fire,

“Reggie Williams jumped offsides
twice against Rutgers,” noted Fazio.

A fable.‘

Once upon a time, a long, long time
ago, there was a city near three rivers.
It was a magical place with nights that
lit up and great godlike creatures called
by the names of Bradshaw, Stargell,
Clemente and Franco. All the people
in the city worshipped these creatures
for many years. The creatures were the
very best in all the world.

One day they changed the name of
the city and called it “The City Of

L Champions.” There were parades and

great crowds and towels‘ and
babushkas. The towels and babushkas
were magical too. They helped the
creatures to win. All over the city there
were winners. Even in the nearby Land
of Oak there was a wonderful creature
named Marino. He won many games,
too. It was all Very good for a long
time. The whole world said the City of
Champions was a great town full of
great sports fans. Black and gold
filled the air.The people thought it
would never end. ‘

Years went by and many of the great
heroes got older and the emperor made
them leave and go on to their “life’s
work.” Some wanted to leave, but
others didn’t. The wonderful sports
fans of the city started ugly rumors
about Marino and told him to get lost.
He did and became a hero all over

again somewhere else. Then the

wonderful sports fans said to Marino,
“Come back, we need you.” But it
was too late.

Other bad things began to happen to
the City of Champions. A great snow
monster from the mountains of South
America came and destroyed a baseball

By Bob Travers

team. They called the snow monster
Cocaine. It ate many heroes and the
fans quit coming to the games. Parker,
Milner, Berra and even Stargell were
all mentioned as being seen near the
snow monster, and the fans quit com-
ing to the games. The Owners from
Ohio said when the fans quit coming
to the games that they wanted to sell
the team. But nobody wanted to buy it.
At least nobody from the City of
Champions. The team was going to
move to Denver and Tampa and Dallas
and Indianapolis. The wonderful fans
didn’t really care too much, because
football season would start soon.

But wait, there was even more bad
news. Another Owner from Ohio said
he was going to sell the Spirit team and
move the Penguin team unless the
wonderful fans bought more tickets.
They bought a few more, and the
Owner said that was OK for now, but
next year was another story. That was
OK, though, because football season
was starting soon.

Alas, football season started. The
team in the Land of Oak had never been
too hot since Marino left and they beat
Purdue but lost to Navy. The wonder-
ful fans never went to games in the
Land of Oak and they didn’t go this
year, either. But that team couldn’t
move, the fans thought. Unless the
Owners sold the entire university,
which they would do if the price was
right and a part of the plan.

The other football team in the City
of Champions did not win very often,
either. Their quarterbacks were not
good and their coach was quite snob-

bish and wouldn’t shake hands with

anyone from Ohio. The fans were upset g

about this so they booed, but there was
really nothing else they could do.

They couldn’t go to baseball games
because of the snow monster and
because the team had forgotten to hire
a new manager. Besides that, said the
wonderful fans, traffic was simply
awful and that was no fun. They
couldn’t park their cars in town because
they would have had to walk across a
bridge that people were often thrown
off. The river was cold, they said, and
they didn’t want to get thrown off any
bridges. So the wonderful fans never
did go back to the games.

More years went by and things just
kept getting worse and worse in the
City of Champions. There was a" new
hero, a creature called Lemieux, but
that was not enough. Soon all the teams
were gone. Even the team in the Land
of Oak was sold to the highest bidder
—- a heart specialist from Penn State.

Now, in the City of Champions the
wonderful fans sit by the empty mills
and empty stadiums and wonder what
went wrong and who was to blame.
They blame the owners for wanting to
make more money. They blame the
players for being friendly with Co-
caine. They blame the politicians and
groundskeepers and ushers and Foge
Fazio (whom they blamed for
everything anyway) and Richard Nix-
on and the Parkway. They are never
sure whom to really blame for the
downfall of the once-proud City of
Champions. But if they would ever
look in the mirror they would see the
person to blame.

Athlete of
Steve Apke

This week’s Athlete of the Week
award goes to linebacker Steve Apke
of the Pitt football team. Apke recorded
21 tackles, a team high, in last week’s
21-7 loss at Navy.

Apke is a 6-2, 215-lb. junior from
Cincinnati Moeller High School. He
earned four letters each in football,
basketball and baseball during his high

his first start ﬁlling in for the injured
Caesar Aldisert in the 1983 Fiesta
Bowl, and he responded by leading the
team with 14 tackles. He also
recovered a fumble.

Although he is considered small for
the inside linebacker position, he leads
the team with 110 tackles in eight
-games. The next closest player in
tackles is rush end Tony Woods, who
has 72. Apke also has one interception
and a fumble recovery on the year.

“Steve has played very, very well

“[Apke] is our spiritual

‘leader and our leader in

tackles, so he is very impor-
tant to us.” A

for this year,” said head coach Foge
Fazio. “He is our spiritual leader and
our leader in tackles, so he is very im-
portant to us. He’s not big, but he plays
very aggressively.”

Apke moved back to linebacker this
season, after spending much of last
year at defensive end. He has made the
change without many problems. In the
second game of the season this year,

IApke made 22 tackles against Ohio

State, the same team he made his debut
against two years ago.

Pitt’s only goal, his third of the season,

°The “Sine Wave Award” goes to
the San Francisco 49ers for their con-
sistently inconsistent play. The 49ers
have destroyed both the Los Angeles
Rams and Raiders but have also been
humbled by the Saints and Vikings.
They’re currently at equilibrium with
a 4-4 record.

°The “Grizzly Adams Award”
belongs unanimously to Chicago head
coach Mike Ditka, who has harnessed
his talented Bears and turned them in-
to the midseason Super Bowl favorite.
Chicago currently has a three-game
lead over Detroit in the NFC Central’
and should stroll away with the divi-
sion title. One contradiction: William
Perry is. anything but “Gentle Ben.”

°The LA Rams are eligible for the
‘ ‘Trick-or-Treat Award.’ ’ On the out-
side, the Rams appear- to be a
powerhouse, ﬂashing an impressive 7-1
record. But as soon as one of the NFL’s
big boys comes along, the facade is
over, and the Rams go down rather
easily. The 49ers proved this on Sun-
day, coming out of the Anaheim with
a lopsided 28-14 win.

°The “Bumble Bee Tuna Award”
goes to the defense of the Miami

Charger owner Alex Spanos. Spanos,

The Pitt -News, October .30, .1985-

As I see it

I By  Brueckner

 
The mouth roars with warranted views 111 Howard Cosell’s book

I’ve always seen a lot of myself in
Jim Stark, the lead character played by
James Dean in “Rebel Without A
Cause.” Jim believed above all other
things, in being true to himself. He
didn’t believe in compromising his own
feelings by doing something that others
wanted him to do. He said, “Here I
am, takeme or leave me. ” I have seen
these qualities in myself and in Howard
Cosell.

I haven’t always agreed with
everything that he’s said, but I have
always admired Cosell’s style. He has
always stood for intelligent, responsi-

, ble, honest journalism. He does not

grant anyone credit that they do not
deserve even if others are granting
them the same. And he does not allow
the unsung hero to remain unsung.
They are not merely words of a clever
slogan. Howard Cosell really does
“tell it like it is.”

His whole professional life he has

‘ , taken abuse for this brashness. He has

especially come under completely un-
necessary and undeserved ridicule for
his book “I Never Played the Game.”

Having just ﬁnished the book, I have
to wonder about the integrity of anyone
who honestly is opposed to it. I guess
that many of these people must be
speaking out against Cosell because it
is the “in” thing to do. But I don’t care
what anybody thinks. I thoroughly en-
joyed the book.

I can’t for the life of me ﬁgure out
why a man should suffer such abuse for
telling the truth. But yet, that is exact-
ly what is happening. Cosell is grant-
ing us the privilege of hearing the in-
side story of many of the recent hap-
penings in the sports world, and what
happens? He is slapped in the face for
what I consider to be a gracious gesture
to the fans. I ‘

I thank you, Howard Cosell, for
allowing me to hear what really goes
on behind the scenes.

It boggles my mind that so many
people ‘feel otherwise. They would
rather have the press cover up stories

and protect the bad element that is‘

slowly starting to eat away at the very
core of the integrity of the sports world.
I can’t understand it.

People do not want to hear and are

simply not interested in the truth. But i

that’s the way the world operates. Sad.

Too many people look at the world
through rose-colored glasses. That is
another problem facing a book like
Cosell’s. People by the scores are
criticizing Cosell for tearing down
some popular people in the book.
These favorites within the sports world
are thought of by too many people to
be gods who can do no wrong. But it

continued from page 13

“The ﬁrst time he jumped, I said he’s
a freshman. The second time, I told
Reggie he’s been in three games, he’s
a veteran now.”

That is the type of situation Fazio is
in. Still, under all this ﬁre, Fazio stands
by his younger players.

‘ ‘It’s experience!” exclaimed Fazio.
“The younger kids just do not have the
experience. ” .

As for Congemi, Fazio has no plans
of a switch in the future. He said he
feels the only thing keeping the pass-
ing game from clicking is practice.

“Repetitions!” said Fazio. “In the
pros the passing game is really great
because they have the same guys out
there every day. When you have that
timing, you are successful.”

Fazio listed the combination of Bill
Wallace and Congemi as an example
of how important timing is.

No argument here. Wallace and
Congemi had it clicking most of the
time.

“In college, one guy always attracts
you more than another,” Fazio said.
“Congemi and Wallace were like that.
It is tough to go in there with different
guys all the time.”

Fazio will look for a marked im-
provement this weekend.

So, the mythical quarterback con-

is you, the fan, who is in the wrong!
Some people don’t like to see their
heroes exposed for what they really

. are. This type of blind worship is not

for me. Fans are wrong for placing
athletes on a pedestal and worshipping
them in the same manner that the
Israelites worshipped the Golden Calf
in Exodus 32. Don’t get me wrong. I’m
not equating Cosell with Moses, but he
is trying to perform the same type of
action. He is not only telling us that
some of our heroes are only products
of the media, but he is showing us as
well.

I have said this before, as has Cosell
and many others. You should not blind-
ly worship an athlete because of
abilities that are demonstrated on the
playing ﬁeld. There’s nothing wrong
with admiring his/her athletic skills, but
that should not carry over into your
opinion of that athlete as a person. Just
because someone hits .350, or rushes
for 1,800 yards, or wins a gold medal,
that does not make that person a model
member of the community. The chil-
dren of today should be taught that only
on the playing ﬁeld should they try to
emulate their sports heroes.

If they are looking for an overall
hero, someone to emulate in their day-
to-day living, they should look to some-
one like Mother Teresa, Audie Mur-
phy, or perhaps a member of their
family. This devotion to athletes
beyond the playing ﬁeld is dangerous.

What happens is that the children
begin to follow these athletes in the
same manner that the apostles followed
Christ. They think that anything that
the athletes say or do is right. One of
these days we are going to hear a story
about how steroids killed a 12-year-old
athlete. By then, it will be too late.

Don’t deplore Cosell for what he as
done. He does not treat these athletes
as gods and neither should you.

What is really a shame is that
because he is receiving such criticism,
many people will not read this book.
That’s a shame because this book is one
that the reader ﬁnds hard to put down.
I found it captivating.

Here’s a quick summary of the book:

The ﬁrst ﬁve chapters tell the
fascinating inside story as to what has
really been happening the last few years
with the NFL and its problems with
franchise relocation.

Chapter six is the controversial Mon-
day Night Football chapter. I must
honestly say that I feel Cosell is 100
percent right in taking the majority of
the credit for its success.

He also dealt with boxing in three
chapters, one dealing with his decision
to leave boxing, one considering the
abolition of boxing, and one telling of
his relationship with Sugar Ray
Leonard.

There was yet another chapter deal-
ing with his relationship with former
baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn.

He tells a mini-history of his show
Sportsbeat which he considers his ﬁnest
achievement.

The ﬁnal two chapters are a collec-
tion of minor stories in the career of
Howard Cosell, with chapter 12 featur-
ing the story of the ridiculous events
that followed after he playfully called
Alvin Garrett a “monkey.”

I would recommend to all of you to

read this landmark book. If you don’t

want to, then you are afraid of the
truth. Cosell’s criticisms of people in
this book has been greatly exaggerated.
He tells of how he considers people to
have two sides, a professional and a

personal side. In many cases, he attacks
only the professional side. But some of
these people can’t handle that. They
say, “Worship me completely, or I’ll
have nothing to do with you!” Now tell
me who is in the wrong.

This doesn’t say a lot about jour-
nalism in this country, but think about
it. Every journalist has a gimmick.
Cosell’s is the truth. That’s sad,
because the truth shouldn’t be con-
sidered a gimmick.

In a related matter: While we’re on
the subject of autobiographies, here’s
a list of people whose autobiographies
I would love to see written. From the
world of baseball: Al Oliver, Pete
Rose, Carl Yastremski, Gaylord Perry,
and George Steinbrenner. From box-
ing: Angelo Dundee. From football:
Mike Webster, Lyle Alzado. From
basketball: Julius “Dr. J” Erving.
From hockey: Wayne Gretzky.

But above all others, from the world
of amateur athletics, I would love to
read the autobiography of Russian
hockey goalie Vladamir Tretiak, who
has been with the team for, I think,
somewhere in the neighborhood of 15
years.

Liberati leading the
Pitt soccer defense

By John Enright
Staff Writer

Dan Liberati, a sophomore starter on
the Pitt soccer team, has been a very
consistent performer for the Panthers
in his first two years.

Liberati was an All-State and
Regional All-America performer at
Springdale High School his senior
year. He was an All-WPIAL selection
three times and made the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette Dream Team twice. Sign-
ing one of the top players in western
Pennsylvania was a big boost for a
rapidly growing Pitt soccer program.

Liberati was very pleased with his
college choice, and he gave a lot of the
credit to his coach, Joe Luxbacher. “I
got offers from a lot of schools,” said
Liberati. “Some of my choices in-
cluded Penn State, Ohio State, Indiana
and Bethany. I am really glad that I
came to Pitt. I like it here a lot. Joe was
a big inﬂuence on my decision. He is
a great coach. He is really easy to get
along with and has a lot of class.”

Liberati, the nephew of former Pitt
soccer All-America Paul Liberati (class
of I962), starts at sweeper back. The
position is not easy according to Coach
Luxbacher: “The sweeper back is like
a free safety in football. He has to sup-
port the other defenders. He has to be
an experienced player who can stop the
other team’s attack and yet still start his
own team’s attack.”.

/I/I006/7246/E E3’, (935
.9.-00 Z/M ﬁm 6%a;.e/  

It is a difﬁcult position to play, but
Liberati does the job well. “Dan has

all the attributes a good soccer player ’

needs,” said Luxbacher. “He is
strong, and he has good quickness and
mental toughness. Dan is one of the
better passers on the team, which is im-
portant because not only does he have
to stop the other team, but he has to
initiate our offensive attack. He
distributes the ball well.”

Liberati, a business and English ma-
jor, is a sparkling performer on a ﬁne
Panther soccer team (10-2-1), and his
play will assuredly get better and bet-
ter because, according to Coach Lux-

bacher. Dan has the one key ingredient’?

needed to improve his game: “Dan
worked hard in the off-season after his
freshman year. He has that self-
motivated drive to become a better
player.”

“One of the hardest things
about college is learning how
to pay for it.”  

“May we help you?”

 
   

Dollar Bank knows that paying for an education can,be an education in itself. That’s why we
offer a number of low-cost loans designed with your borrowing requirements in mind. If you
think you ’ll need money forthe winter term, now’s the time to look into one of these

Dollar Bank loans. "

Low 8% PHEAA Loans— This guaranteed student loan helps cover the cost of any
approved college, trade or vocational school, giving undergraduate student applicants up to
$2,500 per academic year and graduate student applicants up to $5,000. Repayment doesn’t
begin until six months after leaving school, and you have up to ten years to repay. But your
family income affects eligibility. So other financing may be required. S I

Low 12 % PLUS Loans— Government-backed Parent Loans to Undergraduate
Students give parents, as well as independent undergraduates and graduate students, up to
$3,000 a year as a supplement to or replacement for a PHEAA loan. There are no income
restrictions and you have up to five years to repay your PL US loan. 2 ‘

Low 1 1.25%* Home Equity Loans — For maximum student loan help, your parents
can consider the loan that puts their home's equity to work putting you through college. A
Dollar Bank Home Equity Loan. It has all the advantages of a variable rate and you don ’t
have to worry about maximum loan amounts. If your parents’ income is too high to qualify
for other assistance, this is the loan to consider.
