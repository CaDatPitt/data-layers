Erik Brown’s parents dropped him off at the
Wyndham Hotel on Wednesday morning. He
slid his acoustic guitar under his full—size

bed, set up his CD tower and ﬁlled the hotel '

room’s dresser with his clothes.

“It doesn’t feel like home yet. I feel like ‘

Imight be going home tomorrow or some~
thing,” he said. .

Though many students book hotel rooms
to make the move—in process easier, Brown
is ready for an extended stay. He’s one of the

48 Pitt freshmen who will stay at the Wynd-
ham Hotel on McKee Place this school year. ‘
This is the ﬁrst year that Pitt has resolved an
overﬂow housing dilemma by contracting a
ﬂoor of a hotel. ’ H

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said the Uni-

‘ versity set more rigorous standards for its

applicants this year. The stronger candidates
tend to have more options and are less likely
to accept admissions. .

“In the case of the University of Pitts-

burgh, the quality of the admitted students A

improved, but the yield increased!” he said
in an e-mail. W '
As a result, Pitt has about 140 students

in overﬂow housing. In addition to the 48
freshmen and two resident assistants liv-
ing in the Wyndham, there are about8o

- students living in lounges in the Litchﬁeld

Towers and Lothrop Hall and 10 students in
the dental hygiene program living in Carlow
University’s Dougherty Hall.

Brown said hergot the impression he
shouldn’t talk about the speciﬁcs of how
much Pitt charges him to stay in the hotel,

[especially because students, are- living in
the lounges.

“We made a mistake, and we’re getting
some good stu ,” he said.

recruiter

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

Pitt football coaches heavily recruited wide
receiver Cam Saddler, but after he chose
Pitt in 2007, the redshirt sophomore de-
cided to do some recruiting of his own.

The Gateway High School star chose the
Panthers over Virginia and West Virginia
after head coach Dave Wannstedt and assis-
tant head coach Greg Gattuso successfully
courted him.

Now, three years later, Saddler and his
friends from that samerecruiting class are
a big part of Pitt’s nucleus.

The WPIAL class of 2008 was loaded
with talent, and Saddler knew that if the
athletes he had been playing against all
season followed him to Pitt, they would be
something special.

So he became an unofficial ambassador
for Pitt, trying to get Panther recruits to
make the same decision he did.

Saddler began with current starting
quarterback and former Central Catholic
star Tino Sunseri.

The two met during their sophomore
year at the U.S. Army Combine in Texas
where their fathers introduced them to
one another.

“We talked about us being from Pitts-

burgh and just the tradition and how we .

could kind of try to start to bring the tradi-
tion back,” Saddler said.

Yet, Sunseri ended up committing to
Louisville. He began to waver on that de-
cision after seeing what Pitt football was
building toward. Sunseri stayed in close
contact with Saddler in the days leading up
to his decision and let him know that Sad-
dler’s decision would affect his as well.

Vaughn‘ Wallace | SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Forty—eight freshmen and two Residentwllssistants moved into the Wyndham Hotel.

Wyndham 4 1

Brown and all of the other students liv-
ing in the Wyndham and lounges sent in
their housing contracts late, so they weren’t
guaranteed housing, Fedele said.

Brown thinks he sent in his housing con-
tract about two weeks late. He said he got

_ -letters from the University that.sounded
“super hopeful” that he’d get into Tower A,

his ﬁrst choice for housing. In mid-July, he

' found out he would be staying in the Wynd-
’ ham Hotel.

The students in overﬂow housing will
pay rates corresponding to their number

of roommates.

Students livingin lounges with three or

four beds will pay the respective Holland, .

Hall rates of $2,095 and $1,830 per semester

for a triple or a quad. Students living in the‘ ‘

Wyndham will pay the Towers double rate

I of $2,750 per semester, and the students

staying at Carlow will pay the regular Carlow
rate of $2,250 per term. _

All of the students living in the Wyndham
are men.,Of the 80 students living in the
lounges, 18 are women.

In place of a shirt that reads, “Tower A /
Yourjourney Starts Here,” Brown sports an I

ambiguous “Orientation 2010” shirt. Despite
the distance from campus, Brown said he
was “pumped” about living in a hotel.
Though the Wyndham staff won’t be turn-
ing down Brown’s bed or cleaning his room,
he will have other amenities that many dorm
rooms don’t have. His room comes with a
32-inch ﬂat—screen TV, a small refrigerator,

Brian Matous, director of sales and mar-

commonly place students in hotels and in

alternative overﬂow housing, so he’s used to

making accommodations for students.
The hotel will offer a special menu of

The students can order room service

Resident assistant Corey Black said that
since; alt of the doiible abedrooms have ‘re-

. stroorris, there isn’t that extra excuse:-to
. venture out of their _rooms. He encourages

the students to keep their doors open and
to utilize-the hotel lounge, which includes
a round table for studying.

The students staying at the Wyndham will
have access to the Forbes Hall patio, which
is typically reserved for the Honors College
students living in the residence hall.

' Brown said his living situation feels more
and more like a dorm. It helps that all of
the ‘people on his ﬂoor are Pitt students.
There’s a security guard on duty 24 hours a
day, laundry machines that accept Panther
Funds and the same name tags on the doors
to make it easier to meet neighbors.

And he still has to try his room key a few .-

times before getting in.

While the national debate contin-
ues over an Islamic community
center planned two blocks away

“from Ground Zero in New York

City, members of P'ittsburgh’s'
Muslim and Turkish communities
are hosting open dinners at Pitt to
celebrate Ramadan and illuminate
their customs.

The Turkish Cultural Center
Pittsburgh is coordinating Iftar
dinners, which run through Sat-
urday on the Cathedral’s southern
lawn.

Together with a number of g

sponsors, the center coordinat-
ed a two—week effort to provide
nightly meals to local Turkish

‘families and curious community

members. The dinners, which
began Aug. 17, are a part of many
Muslims’ annual Ramadan tradi-
tions, organizers said, and they

Students participate in g
Ramadan fast on campus  ,

offer an opportunity for commu-
nities like Oakland to better un-
derstand both Islam and secular
aspects of Turkish culture.

Ramadan began at sunset
Aug. 12 in North America, and
the cultural center’s dinner tent
went up ﬁve days later. Chefs at
Lez_zett, the new Turkish restau-
rant on Semple Street, provide
traditional dishes like yogurt soup
and simmered beef over rice for
the series.

Ramadan ends a few days af-
ter the tent comes down, on Sept.
9. During the holiday, observant
Muslims abstain from food, drink
and sensual pleasures during the

daylight hours. Then, at sunset,"

the tradition is to gatherwith
family and friends and break the
fast with a variety of dishes and
customs. .

Pitt students and people of all

faiths are welcome to join the din-

ners, which have drawn as many as
200 people to campus per night.

Judaism. The code also dictates the proper
method of slaughtering an animal for con-

“Many people have joined us to break
their Ramadan fasts so far, and many more
have come because they are curious,” Ozcan
said. “In Turkey, these dinners often help
feed struggling families during a holy time,
but here we are serving a little different
purpose. We want to start conversation.”

That conversation is an important one
for Pittsburgh’s small but growing Turkish
community, Ozcan said. He estimated that
about 300 families and a larger number
of students at local Universities like Pitt,
Carnegie Mellon and Chatham have settled
in Pittsburgh. .

“The numbers make community isola-
tion all too easy,” Oczan said. “That is why
these events are so important. We hold food
nights and coffee nights and friendship
dinners throughout the year to get to know‘
our neighbors.”

One CMU student who attended Sat-

fasting for Ramadan.

“It is not very difficult, because you

learn it from your childhood,” said Emre_

Esenturk, who is pursuing a Ph.D. “The
harder part, I think, is refraining from an-
ger and gossip and other poor behaviors.
If you only fast and still behave poorly,lyou
only achieve the shell.” _ .

Esenturk said the meal’s second course,
spiced beef served with rice, is among his
favorite Iftar dishes. _

“A Turkish lady could tell you better
what exactly is in this food and how you-
make it, but it is a perfect dish for Iftar,”
Esenturk said. “We want balanced food,

-and we want to share it.”

New vice provosts hired

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

Provost Patricia Beeson announced the
selection of three new vice provosts less
than two weeks after she took ofﬁce.

Economics chair David Dejong will take
over as vice provost for academic planning
and resources management on Wednesday,
replacing Robert Pack who is retiring.

Two professors will take over Beeson’s
former role of vice provost of graduate and
undergraduate Studies.

Associate Dean for Undergraduate Stud-
ies at the School of Arts and Sciences Juan
Manfredi will administer undergraduate
studies starting in September.

Alberta Sbragia, political science pro-
fessor and director of the Europen Union
Center of Excellence, will take over as vice
provost for graduate studies in October.

Beeson said one of her goals was to have
her replacements, as well as the vice pro-
vost for academic planning and resources

management, in place for the beginning of
the semester. She said she began thinking
about possible candidates for the positions
while she was applying for provost.

After graduating from the University
of Iowa with a doctorate in economics in

O 1989, Dejong came to Pitt, became a full

professor in 2001 and rose to the chair of
the department in 2006. His research has
focused on macroeconomics and — among

other projects — he has worked on Pitt’s—

economic forecast model.

The newly-minted vice provost has also
served on the Board of Trustees’ budget
committee, the Advisory Committee for
the Admission of Student Athletes and the
Faculty Admissions Support Team.

Another faculty member hired in 1989,
Manfredi joined the mathematics depart-
ment after graduating from Washington
University in Saint Louis in 1986.

“You would be surprised how many people
want to work for us this week,” Noel said
Friday afternoon in the Schenley Quadrangle.
The week’s battle with broken carts and slow
elevators had largely subsided, but as she
spoke, a steady of ﬂow students and parents
weaved around her, carryingboxes and push-
ing blue~and-gold housing carts. “It probably
has something to do with the fact that they
get to move in a week early.”

Under the pair’s guidance and with the help
of University officials, including Associate
Dean of Students and Director of Residence
Life Shawn Brooks, the week went smoothly
and, to the delight of many movers, sweetly.
During the ﬁve-day Arrival Survival stretch,
volunteers handed out more than 5,000 slices
of pizza and 8,000 ice cream snacks.

“Even when things go well, things are
stressful,” Kelly said. “We try to provide some
amenities for the parents and the students,
especially the ﬁrst-years. That ﬁrst move can
be roug .” ‘ O

Among the collection of move—in stories
reported for this article, a few stood out as

examples of the conﬂicting energy and emo- '

tion associated with Arrival Survival.

For one freshman moving into Tower A,
the move turned from stressful to sour after
her father’s moving van broke down about a
half hour outside the city. -

A “[My dad] decided to bring his old, beat—up
work van instead of his nice, new truc ,” said
Taylor Hartley, an incoming psychology and
pre-med student from Economy Borough, Pa.
“Well, it broke down. They transferred maybe
half my stuif into our other car, and the van
is about to get towed.” '

Despite the vehiculartroubles, Hartley
was optimistic about her ﬁrstdays at Pitt.
“Once we got here, things were moving great,”
she said. “We know everyone is doing the

best they can. There are just so many new _

people.” . V

Thousands of upperclassmen also moved
in last week, and some parents returned to
Pitt as alumni, shipping off another genera-
tion to learn and grow in Oakland.

Barry Rhodes of Lancaster, Pa., is one such
parent. During Arrival Survival, Rhodes joked
that his daughter decided to attend Pitt to

follow in‘ her father’s footsteps.

“The real reason is that Pitt is an awe-
someuniversity,” Rhodes said. “They also
offer . . . 15th-century Renaissance history.
She wants to be a curator when she gradu-
ates, or a historian. You can do that kind of
thing at Pitt.”

Orientation

Learning to live in a new community is
not always an easy process. To ease the pains
of assimilation, Pitt’s Office of First Year Ex-
perience invites all freshmen and transfer
students to participate in New Student Ori-
entation.

This year’s events ran from Tuesday to
Sunday and included informationsessions,
campus and city tours, social events and
ceremonies to introduce new students to
on-campus life.

Perhaps the highest—attended event took
place Wednesday, when about 3,000 fresh-
men packed the Petersen Events Center and
listened as Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg

and other administrators hosted the convoca-
tion ceremony.

New Provost Patricia Beeson, participat-
ing in her ﬁrst convocation in her role as
chief academic officer, started the ceremony.
She reminded the new studentsthat Pitt is
almost as old as the United States itself and
has contributed a great deal to the nation’s
prosperity since that time.

‘fI’m honored and humbled to welcome
the class of 2014,” Beeson said. “We’ve been
welcoming new students to our community
for over 225 years now. Over those years,
each class has made its own indelible mark
on the University and on our whole society.
We are sure this newest class will not disap-
point, for it is among the brightest we have
so far seen.” -

Beeson promptly introduced Nordenberg,
participating in his 15th convocation, who
spoke for about 20 minutes about the best
ways to “ﬁnd a niche at Pitt.”

Nordenberg warned about the dangers of
drug and alcohol abuse and advised students

to worry not’only about academics, but also
about physical and social health.

“We know that some amazing and inspir-
ing individuals will emerge from within this

. group to continue Pitt’s long and gloried his-

tory,” Nordenberg said. “We also know that
each public accomplishment your class makes
will be accompanied by tens of thousands of

. more personal victo ries that are every bit as

important.”

New student Kyle Schacherer said he
enjoyed learning about Pitt’s longstanding

, history at the ceremony.

“I enjoyed the speeches and all the bad
jokes —- Nordenberg’s especially,” Schacherer

said after the event. “I’ve deﬁnitely got a little _

more Pitt pride now.”

Despite the stale humor, the class of 2014
and University administration apparently
took Nordenberg’s advice to heart: On Thurs-
day, at least 2,496 students again packed
the Pete in an attempt to break a Guinness
World Record. A S

The new students spelled out “P-I-T-T”
with colored ﬂashlights, likely breaking the
record for “The World’s Largest Torchlight
(Flashlight) Logo/ Image Forfned by People.”

Guinness Book of World Records represen— '

tatives must conﬁrm the record before it is

ofﬁcial. '

Timers were on hand and video was taken
of the 10-minute event, with newscasters
Kelly Frey and Scott Stiller of WTAE-TV acting

as ofﬁcial witnesses.

The previous record was set by Full Sail
University in Winter Park, Fla., in January,
when 528 students held ﬂashlights.

l

After the attempt to break the record,
Beeson and other speakers discussed ways
to start a successful academic journey at Pitt,
and by the end of orientation week, the Uni-
versity’s newest members were ready for the
start of classes. '

Oakland isn’t just a college neighborhood, it
is an area with a distinct history and culture,
where one can experience authentic Indian
food and visit the old homes of Andy Warhol
and neighborhood favorite Mr. Rogers.

Once students decide to venture off
campus, though, safety concerns cometo
mind.‘ .

Pitt offers students safety amenities like
late-night shuttles and SafeRider, but when
living off-campus, students must learn to
protect themselvesras the crowds of their
peers begin to disperse.

Aside from altered safety parameters,
those who live off-campus notice many oth-
er differences from their prior on—campus
housing situations. These include increased
freedom and responsibility, a longer journey

Sophomore Chase Welman, 19, said that
after living in Tower A last year, he is adjust-
ing well tohis off—campus home on Dawson
Street. He lives with three roommates, who
are also his fraternity brothers.

“ [The move was] nice because of the new
freedom. And I like to enjoy my freedoms,”
he said with a laugh. V

Welman cameto Pitt from Kansas City,
Mo., and he said the 16-hour drive ‘made this
year’s move-in comparable to last year’s.

“This year I could bring my king-size
bed. It was a struggle, though, because
of the low ceiling [in the new house],” he
said. But bringing in the bed was worth the
struggle. 1

. Many houses in South Oakland are anti-
quated, but Welman said his landlord “ﬁxed
it up.” ’ ' . V‘ A _

“He added tile, and I like our house. The
old and new are mixed in, which makes it

' unique,” he said. “But the walls are thin,

which is annoying.”
According to Welman, the pros outweigh
the cons in his living situation.

tips

1. When going somewhere at  ‘always A

travel with a friend. If you do venture out
alone, make sure there is someone who
knows where you are and when you will

~ be returning.

2. Make sure your doors are locked at all
times. This goes for students in both resi-
dence halls and off-campus housing.

3. Save important numbersin your cell
phone. SafeRider, Pitt Police and city police
can all serve as your —— or someone else’s
— lifeline. Have them ready in case of an

emergency.

4. If you have a car, check on it. Monitor
your car regularly, checking for vandalism
or break-ins. It’s‘best to park your car in a
trusted and safe place.

5. Watch your stuffat the library. It’s never
fun to pack up your whole work area justto
go to the bathroom, but nobody wants to
lose an iPod either. Leave your belongings

‘ i  a friend or lug them with you.

EDITORIAL

  _Q_pim'ons  

Pitt students like Santa
Claus to local businesses

To all new students, both undergrads and

, grads: Gather your purses and wallets.

This is not a drill.

You’re about to reshape the land, make
opportunities for some, break them for
others and cause signiﬁcant sociocultural
change right here in Pittsburgh. People
less keen on the dramatic might describe
your task differently: You’re going shop-
ping.

Whichever words you end up choosing,
the amount of spending you’re sure to do
here over your academic career, starting
today, amounts to some serious cash.

According to a Pitt study, Pitt students
in 2008 injected more than $246 million
into the local economy. That’s more than
half of what the entire city gets in yearly
revenue. The typical college is supposed to
teach you the power of the pen, of dedica-

tion and of creativity, among other things _

—— but at Pitt, be wary of the tremendous
power residingin your wallet.

From retail stores to pizza shops to
local charity organizations, your dollars
will decide what lives and dies in Oakland’s
commercial jungle in the years ahead.
Spending is one of the most direct forms
of community involvement, and your purse
exercises at least as much power over local
issues as does your ballot, if not more.

So while Oakland residents might see
the beginning of fall as a ﬂood of rowdy
young folks preparing to tear up the town
in a swamp of drunken debauchery, the lo-
cal businesses of Oakland see the last week
of August and the ﬁrst weeks of September
as cause forjoyous celebration. It’s Christ-

mas time for Oakland businesses, and, you *

guessed it, in this holiday production you
play the "red-coated fat man with the sack
full of dollars. -

And they just can’t wait to have you
climbing down their chimneys. Pittsburgh
companies are itching to clothe youin
their tight jeans and their intelligent
bras, to nourish you with their humane
hamburgers and their novelty drinks and
to “zip” you around in their pay—per-trip
automobiles. In Pittsburgh, the customer
is always right, but the student is even
righter.

They treat you well because they know
how muchlpower you have.

We won’t holler at you that great power
implies great responsibility. We’ll just say
it politely and with the greatest affection.
Because it’s true.

Before you ask a business if it takes
Panther Funds, you should be asking it’s
acting as you think a business should, if it
delivers goods and services in ways that
coincide with the society that you want_._ An

. informed consumer is an active citizen.

For however long you plan to stay, be
conscious of your impact on this city. We
assure you, the impact will be made, with
or without your consent. In two years, or
four, or six or whenever your academic
pursuits take you away from Pittsburgh,
our community will look and feel very
different from_the way it does now. And
the change will be, in a large part, your
legacy.

So come on, be a conscious Santa Claus:
Choose your gift.

Turn signal, crosswalk usage

optional in Oakland 

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

Just as schools. in Oakland like Pitt, Carlow
and Carnegie Mellon universities are ﬁne
places to get an education, so are the street
intersections.

_As the threat of tests and projects at
school can knock some sense into your head,
so can the threat of getting run over by a
vehicle. North-Central Oakland is home to
some of the most, uh, inventive driving and
pedestrian behavior this side of Rome, and
said behavior is more interesting than the
Nulliﬁcation Crisis of 1832. ,

The record for the ﬁve—lane dash was no
doubt set on Fifth Avenue against trafﬁc, and
the peculiar tradition of the Pittsburgh Left
is alive and well. Around here, some people
treat a red light as not so much a command
to stop as a suggestion to pray a cop is not

nearby as they gun their way through the

intersection. The duel between pedestrians ‘ ,

“jay—sprinting” and drivers following local
customs beats bullﬁghting for dramatic ac-
tion. The “Running of the College Students”
should be a yearly event to bring in tourist
dollars. V j

The question + other than “Did anyone
catch a license plate number?” — is “Why?”
Why are road relations so wild? _

It’s simple. Drivers arelost. Not only lost, ‘

but exasperatedly unsure which streets are
one way, whether the through lane in this in-
tersection suddenly turns into a mandatory
left in the neict block and whether a small
mistake might not be correctable before you
reach Robinson Township. So, corrections
have to be made on short notice, without
signaling. , .

Of course, being lost often means being

late. Pittsburghers, being polite and consid-

’ Morgan Polley I Anthropology Major

“It’s definitely inconvenient for

V ers is one of the things they really

advertise as being "in the center of

far. It’s unfortunate for them.”

Samantha Ramagano I Political Science Major

Michael Griﬂin I Bioengineering Major

“I don’t think Pitt was really prepared
to have that many freshmen coming
here. I don’t think anyone is really
upset about it, I just think they think

it’s funny.”

“I think people ‘living in the
Wyndham Hotel is inconvenient

for them. They’re missing out on a

One way signs are not all they seem in Pittsburgh,   .

erate, cannot bear the thought of tardiness.
So they speed to compensate and don’t want
to be troubled by red lights. For ﬁrst—year
students and virgin Oakland drivers, allow

me to present “How to Walk and Drive (Ter- A

ribly) like a Local.”

Driving: The key to a sticcessful driving
experience is to remember that everybody
else on the road is lost too. Don’t feel too
guilty about cutting across several lanes — it
isn’t that unexpected. In fact, the other driv-
ers were thinking of doing exactly the same
thing. So the focus should be on avoiding a

_ merge into the same space, not on what the

person behind you is going to do. On the

expressways, most of what they told you

about following distances in driver’s ed class
is not to be fully believed. Three full seconds
of following distance? Bah! Who wants to
wait three seconds before hitting someone’s
fender? Two seconds generally cuts it.
Two practices must be constantly obeyed:

T the Pittsburgh Left and the Pittsburgh Yield.

The Pittsburgh Left is quite versatile. If you
are ﬁrst in line at a red light, when the light
turns green, whip into the left turn before
the opposing trafﬁc begins to move. Op-
posing pedestrians‘? Well, hopefully they’ll
remove that feature from the traﬂic lights
where the “walk” sign goes on before the
green light. While the Pittsburgh Left is op-
tional, the Pittsburgh Yield is mandatory.

When on the expressway, try not to leave
a large, empty space in front of your car
when you want the person merging from
your right to enter that space. They suspect
a trap, see, and will not squeeze into that
gaping six car lengths for fear that you will
suddenly hammer on the accelerator and
have a good laugh at their expense. It’s best

to leave only a one-and-a—ha,1f car length gap, ‘

and do so grudgingly. Then they will know
you are for real. ,
“Pedestrianing” like a student: Cross-

'_ walks are for suckers. And squares. And

people who allot more than three minutes to
get from the Cathedral to Chevron. So why
bother‘?Just waltz across the street wherever

‘Q
and whenever you like. Yes, the Man dictates
you might have to run sometimes. But it is
your job to stick it to the Man whenever pos-
sible. Those who especially want to escape

the ennui of everyday life can try crossing

while listening to m'olten—death-black—hard-
rock-metal on their headphones while read‘-"
ing a magazine and sipping a latte.
“Pedestrianing” safely: Trust no one.
Trust no signals. Trust a traffic cop at your
own risk. One-way signs are not all they
seem. It’s sort of like Stalinist Russia without

the Gulags and propaganda posters. Runs.

for your life. .

CONCERT REVIEW

'53:

 

Matisyahu brings good vibes to Mr. Sma||’s

Jordan Streussnig
Staﬁ‘ Writer

When Matisyahu stepped onto the stage
at Mr. Small’s last week, the mood of the
flroom took a noticeable turn.

The buzzing drone of chit-chatters qui-
eted, cell phones were resigned to the
depths of purses and pockets and the reg-
gae artist known for his novel approach to
music bowed his head to the microphone.

,, ;I‘he experience had begun.

From that moment until the very last
note, Matisyahu, an American Hasidic
Jew, exuded a mix of uniqueness and re-
latablity. The 31-year-old native of West
Chester, Pa., wore the traditionaljewish
tallit, a shawl typically worn during prayer

"W/ith four white tassels hanging from the
bottom, aviator sunglasses and a Volcom
flat-brim hat. He was, of course, also

sporting his signature beard and payot,
locks of hair in front of the ears that wear-
ers don’t cut for religious reasons.

His vocals went from a melodious

prayer spoken in Hebrew to a series of rap- '

ping and beat—boxing interludes. Some of
his songs were so catchy that they sounded
like they could be Top-40 hits. Others
blended various types of music, such as
hip—hop and reggae to create a totally
unique sound. -
Matisyahu created his own original
flow, transitioning between rapping,
singing and prayer~like chanting. There
was something to please every taste, and
Matisyahu captured everyone’s attention.
He even threw in some dancing and walked
along the very edge of the stage, hinting
at the possibility that he may fall right
into the crowd. There were many open
hands eagerly waiting, but the artist just
slapped a few high—fives and continued

alongside his band.

The music that set the stage for Mati-
syahu’s performance was played by Dub
Trio, his openers from-Brooklyn, N.Y. The
group and Matisyahu had great chemistry
and a talent for diverse rhythms that was
apparent in its musical sequences. Despite
posessing undeniable skill, the band mem-
bers took a backseat to the solo artist, as
his mouth ran a mile a minute into the
microphone, causing his voice to sound
as if it were another instrument.

Perhaps what was so striking about i

Matisyahu was his seemingly ﬂawless abil-
ity to create an energy unlike any other.
His seamless transitions between reg-
gae, hip-hop, alternative and folk styl-
ings, coupled with his self-effacing lyr-
ics that called for peace among mankind,
created an undeniable air of community
and interconnectedness throughout the
audience.

Ohad Cadjil Visual Editor
Matisyahu plays on stage last week at Mr. Small~’s in Millvale.

Matisyahu’s style is not so mucha clash
of customs as it is an avant-garde merg-
ing of melodies and cultures. While he

performed, it seemed as though invisible -

forces stirred on the stage and inspired
the crowd to be further uniﬁed by the
swaying of hips and the shifting of hands
and heads beneath the green, red and blue
flood lights.

“You can hear the ground breathing,” '

he sang, and it was almost as if you could,

. E listening to the cyclic beat of the drums be-

hind him and the shufﬂe of the crowd.
Matisyahu will continue on to Hungary,

‘ Israel and California for additional shows

to wrap up his 2010 year of performances
of his most recent album, Light, out on
Epic Records. Light debuted in the Top 2_0
on the Billboard charts, and “One Day,”

.a single from the album, was designated

the official anthem for the 2010 Winter
Olympic Games.

Pitt Rep’s playful season

Natalie Bell
Av&E Editor

The University ofPittsburgh Repertory Theatre

. doesn’t like to get tied down.

V The group’s upcoming season spans a range
of emotions ——fromﬂowery to comedic to som-
ber —— and a dizzying array of themes.

Pitt Rep, as the organization is nicknamed,
splits its shows into two categories: main stage
productions and labs. Main stage productions

are directed by thestaﬁ-' and performed in the-

: Henry Heyinann Theatre or the Charity Randall ‘ ,
lTheatrei,'both_in the Stephen Foster Memorial‘. '
The f'al1season’s main stage shows are “Archy 1:

and Mehitabel”-and “Slasher.”

“Archyand Mehitabel’_’. 7 n

writer and poet Don Marquis, whose work ap- ’

peared in newspapers from 1916 to 1930. Gale

‘McNeeley, the show’s director and onlyactor, _

interpreted the material, taking Marquis’ poems

» and arranging them to tell a story.

roach who is so passionate about creating and
writing that he dives onto typewriter keys to
construct stories, and Cleopatra, analley catwho
McNeeley describes as a “gutsy broa .”
“[The poems] are very today, they’re very
modern and universal,” he said. -
McNeeley has given himselfquite the task in
playingupwards of 20 characters. ‘
“‘I like doing one—man shows because it re-
ally puts you to the test. You have to create new

. bodies, new voices,’.’ he said.

“Slasher”

Z The name of Allison Moore’s play is both

appropriate and deceptive:_This is a blood and

gore-ﬁlled show, but it’s not ahorror story — it’s
a riotously ﬁmny satire. Following the produc-
tion of a low-budget horror ﬁlm, the play ques-
tions those slasher movie clichés we’re all too

' ' familiarwith.

Holly Thuma, the director, explained that
rather than bludgeoning her with a message,
the play made her crack upand think at. the
same time.

the Cathedral, althoughthis year, the play “The
Last Days ofjudas Iscariot”willbe performed on
its own in the Henry Heymarm Theatre.

“The labs are a great way to see short pieces
of performances and can introduce people to
playwrights they otherwise might have known
in small doses,” said Kate Whitmore, marketing

director for the Department of Theatre Arts, 4

which oversees the ‘program.

This year’s labs include: “Eleemosynar_y,”
“Words, Words, Words” and “Variations on the

“Wanda’s Visit,” “Krapp’s Last Tape” and “The

Last Days ofjudas Iscario ”

“Eleemosynary” A . A
Director Grant Williams will explore the in-

tricacies of relationships between generations in
this one-act play written by Lee Blessing.

Characters include a grandmother, Dorothy,
who ﬁercely desires to be herself; her daughter
Artie, an intellectual and sensitive individual
who is greatly affected by her mother and Artie’s
daughter, Echo, a driven national. spelling bee
champion._ A

After Dorothy suffers from a stroke, Artie
reconnects with her, forcing the three women

' to confront their tumultuous past and an un-

certain future.

“Words, Words, Words” and “Variations on
the Death of Trotsky,” from ‘All in the Timing”

Director Dave Peterson _is pleased to bring
these two delightfully playﬁil David Ives works to
life. With the description “Two comedic one-act
plays about monkeys and murder. You decide
which is which,” the plays'promise a humorous
and compatible ‘double-header. V
‘ “They reﬂect on each other because they’re
informing similar sensibilities. They play well
together,” Peterson said. A . _

“Words, Words, Words” depicts monkeys
that have been given typewriters to see if they

keys. “Variations on the Death of'I‘rotsky,” uses
eight different scenes to depict the ﬁnal day

Local bartender earns  

a Vegastripwith drink

Jocelyn Meehan
staﬁwriter

Take it from Snoop: One thingthat can
makejuice better is adding a little gin. -
And even though Snoop is not a mas-
ter mixologist, bartenderslike Spencer
Warren of Firehouse Lounge in the Strip
District understand that gin mixed with

the right ingredients can make a great

drink —— one that can earn someone a
ticket to Vegas. - ' ' V

On Aug. 16, Warren and a group of oth-
er bartenders mixed, fused and blended
gin cocktails at sive Lounge in Station
Square in a competition judged byjames
Moreland, a master mixologist.

, Moreland came to Pittsburgh seeking
an inspired bartender to advance to Ve-
gas fora three-day gin—mixing contest.
4 Dubbed “Search for the Most Inspired
Bartender,” this yearly nationwide com-
petition is hosted by the United'States
Bartenders’ Guild and sponsored by GQ
Magazine and Bombay Sapphire Gin

‘company.

' The competition began with local
rounds in 40 large citie_s, challenging
bartenders to create anoriginal, irrcspiredaf
cocktail using‘Bombay Sapphire .Gin. I

sive Lounge hosted the competition
to decide the Pittsburgh contender. After
careful deliberation, the prize-winning
Pittsburgh bartender was Warren, with
his signature cocktail named “Bitter Si-

" lence.” -

“Bitter Silence,” made with Bombay
Sapphire, Aperol, Antica Vermouth, float .
of Green Chartreuse, simple syrup and

mint leaves, got its name from Green
Chartreuse-brewing monks who took
vows of silence. . O

The inspiration for Warren’s drink
came from his own favorite cocktail pref.-
erence, a Negroni,

Traditionally a pre—d-inner cocktail
intended tostimulate the appetite, a Ne-‘

‘ groni is made with gin, vermouth and

bitters. ,
“ - While Warren had worked with the
individualingredients and understood
the ﬂavor properties of each one, the
“Bitter Silence” was the first time he had
combined them..

Warren discovered the ﬁnal “Bitter
Silence” after eight tries and tweaked it.

- once more before his.trip to Vegas.

Warren’s Negroni “Bitter Silence” was
dubbed “Most Inspired” and has acceler-

ated him to the competition’s next level '

in Las Vegas at the end of the month.
Once there, he will compete against 40
top mixologists from across the United
States for the ultimate title. ‘

Warren’s cocktail,’ along with those
created by competing mixologists, will.

' be judged on appearance, style, taste,

aroma, accessibility,creativity and prod-
uct knowledge.
. ~ Last year, the event began at a rooftop

"lounge, with the lights of the city as a

majestic backdrop. On the second night-,
the top 10 bartenders were selected, and '

on the third night, Christian Sanders of _

Miami was crowned the Most Inspired

made with Bombay Sapphire Gin, Gal-
liano Liqueur, lemon juice, agave syrup,
simple syrup, honey syrup, freshly ex-
tracted celery juice, dill paste and dashes
of orange bitters. —

This year, Warren hopes he will fair as
well as Sanders did with his own drink,
but he’s also concerned about doing it
in style. ‘

“I have to figure out what to wear,”

Warren joked as he added that GQ Maga-

zine was co-sponsoring the event.
Warren also needs to ﬁgure out where

_ he can get supplies when he arrives in .

Vegas. , _ S

5 When thesethings are settled, Warren
said he will be prepared and excited for
the competition. '

1 Warren offered several tips for of-
age students want to taste handcrafted
cocktails in Pittsburgh. ,

“Try things: Don’t always" go for an
apple martini,” Warren said.’ _

.' He also noted that people shouldn’t be
afraid of gin and bourbon, because, un-
like vodka that’s colorless, odorless and

- ﬂavorless, mixing with these drinks will

actually bring out delicious ﬂavors.
“Also, try going somewhere where

the bartenders use fresh ingredients,”
Warren said. - L,

You’ll be able to taste the difference
when you drink a cocktail that’s mixed
with real lime juice, as opposed to one
that’s preparedwith a pre-made blend.

Becoming a master mixologist doesn’t
happen overnight. A

However, if you are 21 and are feel-
ing inspired, attempt to recreate War-
ren’s award— winning drink during your,

, “end of the first week of classes celebra- '

tion.” g _

' With bitter hints of grapefruit, this
drink will surely satisfy your taste buds,
while dazzling your friends with your
mixing skills. ' V V W

This way, you’ll be able to party
classier than Snoop, while using the key
ingredient to one of his favorite mixed
drinks 4 ' - ‘

Also, remember: When drinking gin-
infused drinks, make sure to “roll down
the street” responsibly on‘'foot.

‘<4’ City Dwelling Nature Seekers
Wednesday, September 8
- WPTS (92.1 FM) Live Show
9 p.m. — 1o p.m. .

To fully understand one of Pittsburgh’s

preeminent folk-rock groups, City Dwell-
ing Nature Seekers, you might have to go
back in time.

In the late 1960s, rock music changed.
Some groups pursued the most cutting-
edge musical equipment available, whereas
others looked to the past and to the music
that, directly or indirectly, created the soul
of rock music in the first place.

That musical history is engrained in the
sound of the band. ‘

Mike McCormick, the principal singer-

. songwriter of City Dwelling Nature Seek-

ers, assembled the band of music majors
around the spring of 2008 at Duquesne
University.

“We were friends,” said bassist Matt
Booth, “and put it together there.”

Alongside Booth and singer/acoustic
guitarist McCormick are guitarist/har-
mony vocalist Lee Hintenlang and drum-
mer/multi-instrumentalist Chris Parker.

In addition to the band’s core «members,
City Dwelling Nature Seekers employs a
revolving line-up of people who enhance
the experience. A i

In particular, pedal steel guitars expand
the group’s sonic detail. ,

“The pedal steel gives it a more country-
oriented kind of sound,” Booth said.

The group’s live country groove might
inspire thoughts of Nashville, Tenn., but
itwas those bands inﬂuenced by Nash-
ville artists, rather than Nashville artists
themselves, who inspired the songwriting
of City Dwelling Nature Seekers.

“The songwriting isn’t really inﬂuenced
bycountry as muchvasthe rock singer-
songwriters who drew from folk’, country

and American roots Music,” Booth said, - I
. citing “the later records by The Byrds, [Bob _

Dylan’s] Nashville Skyline and particularly
the sonic versatility ‘of The Band” as having
a major impact. A ' I

That versatility shines through in the

group’s new-self—titled album that might
sound fresh to listeners but has been in the

_'works for some time by the City Dwelling .

“We had been playing the songs for
around a year or more,” Booth said. “So
when we went into the studio, we had a
pretty clear idea of what they were going
to sound like.”

Though the band’s songs are now honed
to a sharp edge, they were the product of
adventurous jam sessions.

“There was a lot of experimentation with
different instruments  Chris Parker ended
up playing a lot of different things,” Booth
said. “He played the accordion, banjo, do-
bro guitar and a bunch of different stuff
that gave it a lot of different textures.”

Tracks like “It’s All About To Change”
juxtapose a distorted electric lead with
rhythmic acoustic sound and drumming
that seems informed by the subtlety of
jazz.

Other standouts like “Fire Met a Soul”
make the group’s expansive style clear with
wispy vocals and laidback strumming seem-
ingly interrupted by a “honky tonk” style
interlude that sounds like it could have
been written by Hank Williams himself,
later returning to the song’s powerful bal-
ladry.

While making the album, City Dwelling
Nature Seekers embraced their indepen-
dence as a musical outﬁt.

“We’re doing it for ourselves,” Booth
said. “We don’t have a boss from a record
label telling us what to do, so we don’t real-
ly have to please anyone but ourselves with
our sound. We’re making it how we want to,
and if people like it that’s nice, but we’re
deﬁnitely not trying to please thousands
of people just so we can sell thousands of
records. We’re making a product that we’re
happy and proud of.”

Accordingly, City Dwelling Nature Seek-
ers has decided to sidestep the traditional
city-to-city tour to promote their album.

“We’re not doing a tour per se,” Booth
said.

Instead, the group is trying to hit re-
gional areas on the weekends — includ-

-ing stints in Philadelphia, Mt. Lebanon,

Rochester, Williamsport and even Virginia
and West Virginia — in addition to shows
in Pittsburgh. The group will play at Club

Cafe on S. 12th St. at 8 p.m. Sept. 23.
Since City Dwelling Nature Seekers re-
corded its album in April of this year, the
group has continued to make new music.
“We’re probably going to start record-
ing a second album early next year,” Boot?"

' said. “The release of this album isn’t the

end. We basically have an entire album’s
worth of songs that We’re going to refine
and craft into a new one.”

Ra Ra Riot’s ‘The Orchard’ stays fresh

Liz Keeney
staﬁ'writer

Ra Ra Riot

The Orchard
Barsuk Records
B

With the release of its new album, The
Orchard, indie rock band Ra Ra Riot gives
fans a more sophisticated sound while

still managing to supply the sweetly sad
songs the group is known for.

For the past few years, music lovers
have seen the reemergence of a genre
known as Baroque pop, originally popu-
lar-ized in the 1960s by bands such as the
Zombies, the Kinks and, "on occasion,
the Beatles.

This new resurgence of the conceptual
sound, which is a mix of classical and
rock music, has been given a new, more
technical edge by bands like Deerhunter

and Stars. But few bands are as adept at
showcasing the genre as Ra Ra Riot.

The band from Syracuse, N.Y., features
a string section consisting of violinist
Rebecca Zeller and cellist Alexandra
Lawn.

The two manage to give a polished, ‘

if somewhat despondent, feel to even
the sweetest songs, a characteristic best
heard on the track “Boy.”

Adding to the melancholy sound is lead
vocalist Wes Miles, whose unique voice
adds something extra to every song.

While the combination of Miles’ vocals

and the haunting string section could

give the band too eerie a sound, back-
ing players, who include bassist Mathieu
Santos, drummer Gabriel Duquette and
guitarist Milo Bonacci, use their catchy
beats to keep Ra Ra Riot from becoming
too depressing.

As a whole, the album is easy to listen
to and can serve as unobtrusive back-
ground music.

‘ While at times some songs come across
as repetitive, The Orchard is far from
dull. With this new release, Ra Ra Riot ex-
pands its musical palate, but manages to
stay within its established boundaries.

Sunseri, Shanahan

and more

Saddler 4 1

“As soon as he announced — he
was actually still on stage while
he was taking questions — and
he called me and let me know,”
Sunseri said. “Later that night,

‘Y called Coach Wannstedt and
everybody to let them know that
I’d be coming to the University of
Pittsburg .”

Once into the fold, Sunseri
joined Saddler in his recruiting.

“Once Tino jumped on board
he did just as much work as me,”
Saddler said.

“He was like ‘we could start
something special, there’s a lot
of guys out there who still aren’t
committed and we could try to

at
work on a couple of those guys,’”
Saddler said. “I ﬁgured, why not,
let’s give it a shot.”

Saddler said he was easily‘

able to sway highly touted high
school teammate Shayne Hale
into joining the Panthers. And
Hale committed about a month
after Saddler.

- “Shayne was really easy,”
Saddler joked when asked about
persuading his friend and team-

ate. V

if -Sunseri didn’t have much trou-
ble talking high school teammate

Andrew Taglianetti into commit-
ting, since Taglianetti wanted to
stay close to home.

“We thought [about] all the tal-
‘ent that we had in the WPIAL that
year, the best chance for us to be
successful was to go to the same
school,” Sunseri said. “We always
competed against each other, so
we thought it would be really cool
‘tn play with each other.”

‘ One of Saddler’s next targets
was Norwin receiver Mike Shana-
han. Saddler got to know Shana-
han, Pitt’s current No. 2 receiver,
on his recruiting visits.

When Saddler’s Gateway team

‘played Norwin that season, Sha-
nahan scored a whopping ﬁve
touchdowns and it was at that
point Saddler_ knew Pitt had to

have him.

“I just shot him a pitch and let
him know what we were trying to
do here and he jumped aboard,”
Saddler said.

But it was really another Pitt
receiver who was able to seal the
‘deal on Shanahan’s recruitment.

On his visit to Pitt, Shanahan
met with Jon Baldwin, who had
already committed, and Baldwin
asked his former Amateur Athletic
Union basketball teammate to fol-
low him to Oakland.

“Whenever I had a meeting
with Wannstedt, Baldwin came
up to me and he said he had com-
mitted already and he wanted me
to do the same,” Shanahan said. “I
committed that morning too.” -

Acquiring those local players

would have been a recruiting feat '

in itself, but Saddler’s inﬂuence
spread even further, into eastern
Pennsylvania.

In Easton, Pa., current Panther
free safetyjarred Holley was down
to his ﬁnal two school choices: Pitt
and Virginia.

Since they were both being re-
cruited by the same schools and
had seen each other at a couple
camps, Saddler and Holley knew
each other.

“Once I realized he was down
to Virginia and Pitt, I shot him a
couple texts and told him what we

-were trying to do,” Saddler-said.

The whole time he was pur-
suing, these players, Saddler was
cautious that what he was doing
was all within NCAA rules and
stayed in close contact with the
coaching staff to make sure.

“I was always in touch with our
coaches because they knew what
I was trying to do,” Saddler said-.
“Coach [Chris] LaSala and coach
Gattuso would let me know what I
could do and what I couldn’t.”

Three years later, the players
in that recruiting class now shape
the core of Pitt’s passing game and
parts of its defense, something

Wide receiver Cam Saddler took it upon himself to recruit seve

that those players foresaw even
back then.

It all seemed to register for
them at the same time — at the
Big 33 All—Star game in June be-
tween the best high school players
in Pennsylvania and Ohio.

, “It kind of hit me when we
, were at the Big 33 game,” Shana-

han said. “Everyone was starting
and doing well so I deﬁnitely saw
it back then.”
Saddler agreed with his good
friend and roommate. ‘
“Once we got to the Big 33

game, all of us for the most part .

were playing in it so I knew some-
thing special was going to hap-
pen,” he said. .
“Whenever we were out at the
Big, 33 game a lot of us that are
actually now starting on offense

_ were playing in that game,” Sun-
seri said. “And the wholeweek‘

we kept on saying that this was
how it’s ‘going to be when we got
to Pitt and the Big East was go-
ing to have to worry about all the
playmakers.”

In son_1,',eways,'their recruiting "

techniques resemble what occurs
in professional sports.This sum-
mer, LeBron James made head-

MEN’S SOCCER

 

Defense excels,
offense struggles

This weekend, Pitt only scored one goal, but went 1-0-1.

*> A Donnie Tasser
Staﬁ’ Writer

The Pitt men’s soccer team didn’t allow a
goal in two exhibition games this week-
end. .

The only problem was it couldn’t ﬁn-
ish many goal~scoring opportunities of
its own. _

The Panthers ‘opened up the season

with an exhibition game victory over 4

California University of Pennsylvania
on Wednesday. a R ‘

In the 26th minute, Ryan Brode scored
the only goal in the 1,_-Orvictory into the
lower left corner from close to 30 yards
out. _

Senior midfielder Alex Betancourt
registered the assist. . V

The Panthers. outshot the NCAAj)ivi—

/sion‘_IIlVulcans,14.-V4 and had several’dtl‘Ier‘,
chances but couldn’t ﬁnd the back of the g

net again. .- N A  pi . . 1 . .

“We controlleldthe’ :gatn?’le'l_’l5i1't9"*rr°1isisedral
couple of goals and had one called back,”
head coachjoe Luxbacher said.

L Pitt’s goalkeeper'Hami Kara, a junior.

_tr'ansfer_fro‘m Prince George’s Community

’ College, playedrall 90 minutes in net and

threatens" to take the starting goalkeep-
er position from the returning starter,
sophomore Keegan. Gunderson.
Gunderson is currently" outtwith a
concussion. ‘ e_ r . l V

Kara was ranked‘ the  _N_]CAA goal-"

zkeeperin the nation last season;

“Kara is a‘ good goalie and has played _

well so far,” lLuxbacher_,s'a.id., “He was

ajunior College All—American and is a
great competitor. The goalie competi-
tion is great, and Keegan will have to
win his spot back when he returns from
injury.” ’ ‘

This game was also highlighted by an '

all—Kalas showdown.

Pitt senior defenseman Andy Kalas and
his brother Mike, who plays for California
University of Pennsylvania, represented
their respective teams as captains prior
to the match. 1

Pitt tied St. Francis (Pa.) 0-0 in its
second exhibition game on Saturday.

In what has become a familiar trend
dating back to last season, the Panthers
once again had trouble finishing.

They outshot the Red Flash 13-8, but
much- like in the first game — and all of
last season + they had trouble finding
-_the..l),a_<i:,k,of the net.‘ 1 , ‘ ‘

 f“We playedj.tw_o ‘solidi:-_games;,’vdefeni— 

sively and- offensively,” Lluxblacher said‘.
“Against St. Francis,- we had chances but

Q; couldn’t put one in. They are a solid team,

but we controlled the game.” -
“At the end of the day you win wit
defense. You obviously need-to score, but

' we still playedl’solidigames,” Luxbacher

said. “We don’t need to adjust anything,
just wait for the team to come around.

. We have a lot of new players, and they are
still «getting usedto one another.”

Freshman Alex Grayson lead the team
with four shots,.and both Kara and fresh-
man Matt Aberegg sawltime in goal. .

JAMEEL POTEAT AND TERRELL CHESTNUT

P Pitt received two commit-

ments in two days from
some _of Pennsylvania’s best

recruits. . A

Running back Jameel
Poteat committed, on {ply
28 and defensive back er-
rell Chestnut announced his
decision the following day.
Both are four—star recruits,
according _to Riva1s.com, a
site that ranks prospective
college recruits based on
their statistics and evalu-
ations from a team of ex-
perts. . _ ‘ _

Poteat is a running back
from Harrisbi_irg,.,and last
year, during his uni_or sea-
son at Bishop Mc evitt Hi h

‘School, he rushed for 1,6 4
yards and scored 24 touch-
downs. At 5—foot-11 and 195
pounds, he says his inspira-
tion was former Panther run-
ning back LeSean -“Shady”

McCoy, who also went to

Bisho McDevitt. .
“[ cCo ]’s like_ my big

brother,” oteat said.

But McCoy was only a '

small inﬂuence on Poteat’s
decision. The tea_rn’s recent
success was more important,
he said.

Chestnut was also an inﬂu— I

ence. He plays uarterback
at_ Pottstown’s ottsgrove
High School. In the past
two seasons at Potts rove

he ran for 2,248 ar s an .

scored 40 touch owns. He

also passed for 1,438 yards

and 13 touchdowns. C
Poteat said he and Chest-
nut are best friends. ’

Alex Oltmanns

Sports Editor

 

What’s up everyone? Being that this is

I wthe first edition of this school year’s Pitt

News, it’s also my ﬁrst weekly column of
the year. ‘ 4

I will write about avariety of sports top-
ics. Not just Pitt sports, but all things going

on in the sports world in general.

For this week, I wanted to share my
thoughts about this year’s Pitt football
team. ' _

This is probably the team’s mosthighly
anticipated season in the past 1.0 years,
and certainly in coach’ Dave Wannstedt’s
tenure.

The team is ranked No.- 15 in the AP Top
25 preseason poll and was almost unani-

-5

mously picked to win the Big East.

It has All—Americans all over the ﬁeld
with defensive end Greg Romeus, receiver
Jon Baldwin, left tackle Jason Pinkston and
Heisman" candidate, running back Dion
Lewis. ’ ‘ - '

Yet-, there are still plenty of doubters
out there. A

Connecticut? Really‘?
He’s entitled to his opinionand he really
knows the game, but he’s simply one of a

microcosm of people who choose to focus ‘

on Pitt’s “question rnarks” coming into the
season at quarterback, cornerback and the
interior of the offensive line.

After watching the team’s training camp
every day for thebetter part of August, I.

4. would like to put those questions to rest.

V First off, Pitt will be just ﬁne at.quarter—

Yes, he has limited experience in games, _

but he’s been groomed to be the starter

. He took every single rep as the ﬁrst-
team quarterback in spring practice and in
training camp, something no other Panther
quarterback has had the luxury of receiv-

' ing in recent years because‘ of quarterback
controversies; ~ l ‘

To add to that,h_e has all the physical
tools needed to be successful. His arm is
strong, andhe has the speed to escape from
the pocket and take off and run when his

Lewis
looks for
big game
at Utah    

Oltmanns ( 43 . ,
bers will get their ﬁrst chance to do that
on Thursday against Utah.

The line is rock solid on the outside
with Pinkston and junior right tackle Lu-

cas Nix.-
But on the inside of the line, the Pan-

thers have to replace three seniors from‘

last season_. , ’

Chrisjacobson stepped up early in camp
to win the job of left guard, former walk—on
Alex Karabin will be the starting center and
Greg Gaskins will open the season as the
starting right guard.

So I guess the jury is still out on those

players, at least for now.
But I don’t think it will be for long.

Maybe only until they pave the way for -
Dion Lewis to run wild on Utah’s defense. _
Then, we’1lsee if people are still picking

Connecticut to win the league.’
