SFA Formuateé Plans

For Summer Program

SFA held its ﬁrst Summer meeting in history last Thurs-

day night. .

The sixteen members present, did not constitute a
quorum, and only one, Dr. Vincent Lanfear, Dean of the School

of Business Administration, was a
faculty member.
Majority of those absent were

women‘, and Independent members
were more numerous than Frater-
nity members.

Mike De Marco, C43, chairman
of the Statistics committee report-
ed on the plans he had drawn up
for the operation of his committee.
Said De‘ Marco,’ “the Statistics
committee can be one of the most
important organs on campus for
ﬁnding out student opinion.”

He told of the lack of effort
shown in the committee reports of
previous years and promised that
his group will be active. Bi-weekly
polls on subjects of student inter-
est will be conducted and the re-
sult printed in the Pitt News. The
committee will operate under an
executive council, which besides de-
termining the policy of the com-
mittee, will also serve as a sound-
ing board on student opinion.

President Gus Wilde, C43, an-
nounced the plan of SFA execu-
tive committee to hold dances dur-
ing the summer. A free tea dance,
which will probably be held in
Cathedral Gym during the ﬁrst
week of August, will serve to
bring Summer school students to-
gether and create a fraternal at-
mosphere among students, a great
portion of whom are Summer
transfers from other schools.

Another dance, an all-University
dance, is being tentatively planned
for late August or early Septem-
ber. It will probably be an infor-
mal dance held at one of the local
hotels. The appointments commit-
tee will hear petitioners for chair-
man at a time to be announced
soon.

University social rule was violat-
ed by Engineering and Mines asso-

August 12. Although the matter
has been cleared up, the point was
made thatperhaps this rule should
not stand during the Summer ses-
sion since circumstances are at

, present different from those exist-

ing during the normal school year.
Outdoor dancesare the vogue in

Summertime and outdoor pavil-

ions are generally not available on

Friday or Saturday, assemblymen

stated. Furthermore, they said, if

a few students cut an early class

the next day, it will not be the

first time for many people.

The problem will be considered
by the Social committee and pre-
sented as a recommendation to the
University authorities. .\

William Clemmer, C43, suggest-
ed that the War Stamp and Bond
committee be reorganized for the
summer session. The idea was con-‘
sidered satisfactory and the chair-
man of that committee will be in-
formed.

In‘ Services

, A nation-wide campaign among all collegeﬁ and “ﬁlV9_1"f
sities will be started this fall to enlist all undergraduates In
some branch of the armed services, active or reserve, accord- ,
ing to Lawrence Irwin, assistant to the dean of men and eo-

ordinator of service opportunities.

The purpose will be to place the
prospective service men in the
branches best suited to their cap-
abilities.

For this reason, all men stu-
dents who are not close to being
scheduled for induction are urged
to postpone their enlisting in the
Army Enliste". Reserve ‘Corps,
which began enrolling men stu-
dents here last week.

The program planned for the
fall is already in ‘effect at Yale
University where almost all of the
undergraduate men are enrolled in
a reserve status in the Army,
Navy, or Marines. In the fall, this
program will be extended over the
nation. "

In September or October, a joint
Army-Navy-Marine Corps pro-
curement committee will come to
the "University. The Army, Army
air corps, Navy, Naval air corps,
and the Marines will be repre-
sented. 

The procurement committee will
have full information about all the
branches of the. services,‘the type
of men needed in each, and the
qualiﬁcations needed for enlist-
ment in all of the branches.

Those who enlist in any of the
various reserve branches will be
allowed to ﬁnish their college edu-

Again, as last spring, the Pitt News has been

 .charged with being anti—fraternity. This was not

__true last spring. It is not true now.

The charge this time, that we allowed personal
opinions of fraternities to interefere with our treat-
ment of rushing news, is even more serious than

- that of last spring.

Those fraternity men who have accused us of
such journalistic “sabotage,” base their accusa-
tion on several things they have read in the Pitt
News.

That most of them were written by a frater-
nity man apparently makes no difference to the
boys.

The articles in question are those which say
that fraternities have hit the lowest rushing mark
in University history—a fact which is true. What

A the fraternity men are sore about is that we called

this semester’s results the lowest in University
history, without waiting until all the results were

U.in.

For, the way rushing is being run this year, is

~ on an “open” basis, which means that bids can be

accepted and men pledged any time up until fall.

I ‘As we go to press somewhere around 30 men have

accepted bids. ,
And if no more, or if very few more men accept
bids to fraternities then rushing Wlll have “hit its

 

mit  It 

lowest mark.” ,

And there is reason to believe, that very few
men will accept fraternity bids. For one thing
bids were sent in as early as two weeks ago, and
anyone who isn’t interested enough to accept a
bid after two weeks time will certainly not “see
the light” now. _

The reason that several fraternity men gave
for their being peeved is that the News’ treatment
of rushing had placed some sort of stigma on the
Greeks——that the sparsity of pledges necessarily
igeﬂected some inherent evil in the fraternity sys-

em.

The Pitt News has never made such a claim or
implied it. If the fraternities have “taken it on the
chin,” so have Pitt Players, the band, the Pitt
News, SFA.

And there is nothing to do but admit it. Sure
the fraternities did the best they could under the
existing circumstances. But those same circum-
stances are going to continue to exist—and to try
to soften the blow by talking of “comparative and
proportional rushing results” is to lull ourselves
into a false sense of security. ‘

Of course rushing, taken on a relative or pro-
portional or comparative basis has been carried out
as successfully as in previous years. But there are

certain absolutes, not relative things that have

to be considered. :

For instance, the Pftt News attratned three
freshmen this summer, instead of the usual 15 or
20. Proportional to the enrollment, this is as large
a number as we’ve ever got. But still, there are
only three new faces in the News oﬁ‘ice. And in four
years when it comes time to appoint some eight or
ten staff heads, there’ll still only be three people
qualiﬁed.

Similarly, there are certain unflexible abso-
lutes in fraternity life. The cost of maintaining a
house for one thing. The minimum requirement

. for a well-rounded athletic and social program for

another.

And, since fraternities have, this summer,
failed to satisfy these “absolutes” the blow to
fraternities is a serious one indeed. For the Pitt
News to adopt the methods of the fraternities-—
to keep up the impression that “it’s a great year
for the fraternities,” would be a breach of faith
with our readers. It would be writing what just
isn’t true. ,

For it hasn't been a great year for the frater-
nities. Nor has it been for any activity. But it has
been and is going to continue to be a great year for
the University’s participation in the war effort.
Which makes it ﬁne with us. Even‘with our lonelv

In the final analysis. it will prob-
ably be the people of the‘ United
States who will determine when the
“freedom from want” of the At-
lantic Charter will become a reality.

When the conﬂict is ended, when
the peace comes, we will have in
our power, the means for the most
of civilian
goods in history. We will have the
tools, the resources, the supplies.
And we will have the market, if
we work and plan for that market.

Of course, we will have the na-
tions of the old Hemisphere, ruined
by years of conﬂict, to feed and
to rebuild. But this is not the mar-
ket for which we should plan.

The real market is right here at‘
home. With our monumental re-
sources, and our ever-increasing
productive capacity, it will be with-
in our power to take the longest and
most solid steps o'f any of the na-
tions toward that “freedom from
want.” But only if we recognize the
real and just use of these productive
opportunities.

Here in America, we can take
these steps toward the almost total
extinction of privation, hunger,
economic malnutrition in the best,
the easiest, and most human way——
by means of evolution. In other na-
tions, less fortunate, revolution,
force and violence must, it seems,
inevitably be resorted to in order

0 to gain the same goals which we

can reach peacefully. ,

But let no one be confused as to
this one thing. If we in America
refuse to properly control and
guide the potentialities of this pro-
duction and of these resources, and
if we refuse to act for the com-
mon good, we will be playing with
revolution. Such potentialities as
we will possess cannot be long sup-
pressed. Their very existence pro-
duces such powerful economic, po-
litical and social pressures, as to
make their eventual appearance
certain. Whether they appear as
the result of a slow, steady prog-
ress, or whether they erupt into
view, will depend upon the skill
with which we‘ plan, and the ex-
tent to which we plan. .

But will "we in the United States
use these national and international
instruments for the attainment of
that economic liberty and “freedom
from want?” Will we plan?

Henry Wallace and others speak
of what they call “the Century of
the Common Man.” Others who join
the chorus tell us that we are ﬁght-

e\\ot‘s

by lcm... 1 Century of the Common Man

Must be Created, FouglitFor 

ing now, and must ﬁght‘ in the fu-
ture to prevent “fear, hunger and
frustrated hopes inthe post war

era.” ,

But the Century of the Common
Man and Freedom from Want do

not simply come. We cannot sleep .

and awake to see them real. In or-
der to gain them we must work,
think and plan for them.

So today, we say, “Let us think,
and plan and work.”

But wars and _ words can be .
strange things. The very volatile
nature of war itself tends to point
up some aspects of culture and
subdue others. Wars and the emo-
tions they arouse too often result
in emotional thinking which exists
without a rational basis.
the emotional reactions produced
by war decline in strength because
of the withdrawal of the stimuli,
the thinking will collapse. A re-
gression will result, though in re-
ality there will not be a true re-
gression in the sense that there
was never any actual movement
toward or from a goal. But the
extent to which the mind envision-

ed certain new ideals will produce
a backward elfect. if

Today, many who hear that this!
conﬂict is the “ﬁght of the com-

political security, and who hear

“I had some of the natives build
me a native hut,” Bacall writes.
“It is made entirely of wood and
bark, has a porch and three rooms.
I wish it were possible to transport
the thing in toto back to the States.
It would make an ideal summer

Two New Maths Caiurses
:‘\ddecl By Evening School

In response to the pressing need

4 for additional intensive mathemat-

I ics courses for men about to enter

the armed forces, two new courses

have been added to the University
evening curriculum.

The new courses are: mat.he-
matics E 15, artillery ﬁre control,
and mathematics E 28, advanced
navigation. These courses are de-
signed especially for men who will
soon enter the armed forces in po-
sitions which require an intensive
knowledge of these special phases
of mathematics.

Mathematics E15 is a four-weeks
course in artillery ﬁre control,
which includes a study of orienta-
tion, trajectory, use of range
tables, and elementary applica-
tions of the theory of probability.
The course, which gives two credits,
will meet Monday and Thursday
evenings, from 6:15 to 9:15 oclock,
from August 10 to September 4.
Plane trigonometry is a prerequis-
ite.

Registration for these new
courses will take place in the class-
rooms at the first class meeting.

Other war mathematics courses
now available at the University
are: Mathematics E 11, plane and

With the idea of having recreational competitive athletics
for the fraternity men, intramural director Frank Carver
today announced the plans for the summer Interfraternity

sports program.

Lack of facilities and suitable
playing times confronted both
Carver and IF athletic director
Jerry Ripp, C44, at first, but last
week arrangements were complet-
ed with IF council and a brief
sports program will be given.

Swimming, mushball, and tennis
wilbbe the only athletics offered
and will be played on a round robin
basis. The swimming meets will
be held during the ensuing weeks
in the evenings.

Instead of the usual medals and
trophies which are, at present, on
the priority list, certiﬁcates will
be given to the winning groups.
'l‘he points that the winners earn
in this summer program will in
no way effect the all-point trophy.

Today is the ﬁnal day for en-
tries, and the program is expected
to start either Thursday or Fri-
day of this week or Monday of next
week.

War aims of our allies and of our
enemies were discussed by Pitt de-
baters last week in the third of the
discussion groups sponsored by the
Morale Institute. The program,
presented before a small audience,
was under the direction of Dr.
Charles Lomas, instructor in speech.

Student debaters who took part *

included Abe Bluestone, who talked
on China; Howard Monsouir on
Japan, Harold Gondelman on
Great Britain, Leonard Winogdad
on Russia, and Holbert Carroll on
Germany.

“J apan’s economic set—u-p de-
manded war,” said Monsouir, and
“Russia is not interested in ‘con-
quest. She’s out to save her neck,”
was the opinion of Winograd.

many who do not really understand
the fundamentals of this conflict,
what this conflict ought to mean.

There is no need. He knows. He has

already been . ﬁghting for two do-

and for that economic liberty which
we are just beginning to envision
