would take effect in the event that .

-engineering groups will follow,
creating an engineering -center.
Pitt’s sudden offer to provide a
site was an answer to offers by
Northwestern University, The Uni-
versity of Chicago, and-Illinois In-
stitute oi‘ Technology. J ' , .
In an editorial, Nov. 30, the
Chicago Daily Tribune urged for
the establishment of the proposed
structure in its city by pointing
out the obvious “faults” in our
city which offers only “a bundle ’
of cash and a site.” “As an in-
dustrial center ‘Pittsburgh is on
the downgrade, its inefficient steel
mills are the first to shut down
and the last to reopen, it is in-
conveniently located and hotel
facilities are meager.” .

The article continued, “If the
four societies decide to hole up in
Pibttsburgh, it may be doubted
that any sothers would follow."

I Vigorous Effort

Pitt’s offer and other proposals
made by the Pittsburgh committee
are alvigorous attempt to add an
engineering center to the advances
being made in industrial expan-
sion. - .

Dean G. R. Fitterer, head of the
School of Engineering and a mem-
ber of the Engineer Society of
Western Pennsylvania, which
spearheaded the Pitt proposal, is
encouraged by favorable comments
of the visiting engineers.

He started that “. . i. it might be
said that if the societies move
from New York, Pittsburgh has
much better than an even chance

of getting.-the "Founders Societies
headquarters. Also if it does come
to Pittsburgh, it is at least an even
chance that the University site
would be selected.”

Dean Fitterer announced that
future plans were uncertain until
the committee could be informed

of the needs of the engineering so- .

cieties size. It is necessary for each
of the member engineering“socie-
ties to obtain a vote of its mem-
bers requesting permission for the
Real Estate Committees to begin
necessary legal changes. J

Representatives of the engin-
eering founders societies are de-
ciding between Pittsburgh and

the Board of Trusteeslfor the Uni-

mittee to handle the engineering

itt Campus Expansion

Possible With Mellon Land Gift

The “major gift of land”

from the Mellon Trust may solve a good deal of the ques-
tions as to where such buildings as a Student Union, library
and dormitory might be built. 1

On Tuesday, Alan M. Scaife, president of the University’s

the University has received

board of Trustees, announced thate
the gift of property would provide
a new campus axis and afford

academic buildings.

The main detriment to construc-
tion of such buildings as a Union
was the lack of land, Chancellor
Rufus H. Fitzgerald has held.

University Requests Land

Dr. Scaife revealed that the Uni-
versity had requested the A. W.
Mellon Educational and Charitable
Trust to make. available to Pitt
the tract of land bounded by Fifth
Avenue, Tenny-son Avenue, and
Bigelow Boulevard and Ruskin
Avenue.

Chancellor Fitzgerald comment-
ed, when informed of the pro-
posed gift, “This valuable addi-
tion will provide an answer to
some of our most pressing prob-
lems in planning construction of
new, buildings for the University.”

Building on Lawn Prohibited

The problems of adequate land
first began last winter when the
Board of Trustees refused to per-
mit plans, for construction of new
buildings on the Cathedral Lawn,
to go through. The New York Life
Insurance Company had agreed to
ﬁnance the Lawn construction b t
their plans had to be dropped
when the Trustees took their stand.

Another buildingiwﬁiat has been
held up because of needed land,
though $2,500,000 has already been
acquired to ﬁnance its construc-
tion, is the George Hubbard Clapp
Science Hall. Although nothing
deﬁnite was said concerning this
building Chancellor Fitzgerald in-
dicated that the Trustees favor lo-

Well-Known Reindeer Tells. All

NORTH POLE, ARCTIC. Looking very dapper for '
an 18-point buck with chalked muzzle and matching
white tail assembly, Dasher, famous front-running
reindeer for the S. Claus Parcel Service, stated today: «

1. Conditions on the northern tundra are pretty
much the same as ever. No-o, TV hadn’t affected
the grazing habits of the middle-class herds.

2. That despite ‘reports to the contrary, you’
don’t ever thoroughly adjust to sub-zero weather,

. regardless of the warm

esteem people hold you in.

3. Rumors of a reindeer-‘strike for Christmas Eve
are unfounded. Somebody’s got a termite in his

antler.

When asked about the most popular Christmas gift ‘
down through the years he replied without hesitation:
“Menswear by Ilﬂmhattan. I’ve helped haul Mr.

Claus’s sled, roe and buck,

nigh unto forever. . . so I~

ought to know . ; . nothing makes a man happier than
shirts, sportshirts, ties, pajamas, beachwear or under-
wear labeled M anhattdn. Don’t know whether it’s the
live style that makes a man look and feel so good,
whether it’s the traditional tailoring detail, or the
array of fabrics, patterns and colors that are all so

unmistakeably quality. I’ll

admit one thing. I’ve kind

of wished sometimes that Manhattan would make

deerwear.”

"They say he can held a note longer than anyone in
the whole band."

News of the expansion of Pitt's building program ar-
rived so unexpectedly Tuesday that weidid not have time
to comment editorially on the new acquisition to the campus.
Our poor efforts will make little difference in the think-
ing of many people who are still considering the event but
we feel that some form of comment from the students is
justiﬁable and appropriate. ~ A

With the many others, the Pitt News has complained of
the lack of a true campus at Pitt and we wrote and thought
bitter words when it appeared that the University had
determined to invest everything in an attempt to expand
the Medical Center and graduate schools and allow the
undergraduate educational system to shift for itself. We
realized the importance of the nurses home, the tremendous
advances made and planned for the medical and health fa-

’cilities, and the expense required to staff the new pro-

grams. But we thought the undergraduate students de-
served a break and warranted a share in the improved and

 expanded educational facilities.

As so often happens, we" didn’t know the facts behind

 the program and we began to cry before all the cake was

passed out. Now the University has attempted to prove
its interest in the entire student body and they have taken
steps to provide for their welfare. Although there are still
no deﬁnite plans madepublic, the acquisition of the proper-
ty and the words of Chancellor Fitzgerald have stirred the
hopes and dreams of everyone concerned. It is obvious that
events are in.the making for a full-scale campus and the
necessary buildings and facilities to furnish it. Three acres
of ground will support more than one building and this
could mean that Clapp Hall, a library, a student union,
and dormitories may soon be in the offing. Not all of these
could be included in the ope tract but we believe at least
two of the promised buildings will be scheduled to replace
the asphalt parking lot, and that is a ﬁne beginning. aWe
don’t expect these improvements immediately and now
that tangible evidence has been provided, we’ll be able to
wait more patiently. I

Now Vat You   Thi n k?

- By Jim Bender

We used to live next to a taciturn Dutchman
who, when .he found something he didn’t like,
would shake his head slowly and say, “You know
Now I think ‘dammit.’ ”

The Dutchman would hear his thought echoed
if he came to Pitt and listened to my reaction to
“student readers,” an obnoxious system of time-
saving used by lazy instructors. 
Authority Peddled

These student readers, if you
haven’t “come in contact with
them, are students employed by
instructors to read the written
assignments of other stulents.
The readers are given authority
ranging from correcting gram-
matical errors to commenting on
the ideas presented in the as— 
signment, depending on how much authority the in-
structor is willing to subcontract. , '

Instructors defend this practice by saying that it
relieves them of unnecessary and inechanical du-.
ties. It certainly relieves them of duties, but have
we reached the point in education where the in-
structor. no longer considers reading papers as a
part. of teaching?

What's the Purpése?

  

I always thought written assignments were given.

with the purpose of showing the instructor just
how well he was getting the material across. If
this. is the purpose then how can the instructor
know the student’s progress if he doesn’t read the
papers? Instructors usually answer this by say-
ing, “Well, I look at the papers after the student

reader haschecked them.” This is rather nice of
the instructors, but it is also nice of the student
to do the assignment. If an assignment is made
the student should feel an obligation to fulﬁll it,
and the instructor should feel an obligation to
read it. .

The Busy Man

The man who is “too busy” to read the assign-

ments is giving too many assignments. A student‘

who‘ says he is “too busy” is told to take fewer
credits and cut down on his activities. Instructors
should be-told the same thing. ' ‘

If it ‘isn’t the purpose of assignments to gauge
a student’s progress then they become busy work,

such as that used by teachers in the primary gr-adesh;

to keep their pupils occupied. My time is well oc-
cupied as it is without having to write papers which
help keep a student reader employed.

Are Students Capable?

These student readers aren’t, to be blamed for

q the torpid condition of these instructors, but the

question arises as to the capability of the student
reader. Many of them can mark simple errors, but
how many of them are equal to the job‘ of com-
menting on the more involved type of paper? These
students do not have the wide e_xperience'and train.-
ing necessary. If they did they would have classes
of ' their own. ‘ _ A

I don’t know how many instructors use these
student readers, and I don’t know if the University
sanctions their use, but it seems that both the in-
structorsand the University could devise a’ pro-
gram which'would eliminate any “need” for the
readers. ~

From 25 m.p.:h. to 1238 m. p. h:

By Jim Deweese

It all began 50 years ago when
a couple of shy young men named
Orville and Wilbur put an en-
gine on their glider and intro-
duced powered‘ ﬂight to the
world. But the airplane did not
deviate appreciably from this
ﬁrst crude de- '
sign until the
advent of
World War 1.
Thus we may
say that the
airplane has
been develop-
ing for only
40 years.

Its develop-
ment is almost.
b e y on d the
realm of com-
prehension. The Wrights ﬂew to
an altitude of 10 feet on their
ﬁrst ﬂight and\attained a speed

 

of about 25 miles per hour. In“

_l947, just 44 years after the
Wrights initial " ﬂight, Major
Charles Yeager ﬂew the Bell X-1
at a speed of 900 m;p.h. and to a
height of 70,000 feet. -
woo m.p.h. Old sum

The astonishing thing about air
progress is that this same re-
search plane, the X-1, is now con-

‘Pitt Players Review  .

Ti me and the Speed ofSound

sidered obsolete and has been on
display in the Smithsonian Insti-
tute in Washington, D.C. for the
past three years.

The X-l’s predecessor was the
Skystreak, a jet powered ﬂying
laboratory, designed by Douglas
Aircraft for high speed research.
This single-seat bundle of dyna-
mite was being clocked at 660
m.p.h. while ﬂying only 50 feet
above the desert at Muroo, Cali-
fornia when something went

‘ wrong. They are still picking up

the pieces.
Jets vs. Rockets

Douglas engineers, realizing the
then inability of the jet engine

to push a ship through the air at

supersonic speeds, had designed
a rocket powered craft even be-
fore the crash of the Skystreak.
This new ship,.a slim, needle-
nosed, swept—wing plane was
dubbed the Skyrocket. Last year
Bill Bridgeman, a test pilot for
the CIA.A., ﬂew the Skyrocket
to a speed of 1238 m.p.h. and
didn’t stop» going up until he had
reached an altitude of 83,000 feet.
The Skyrocket is now considered
obsolete and the X’-1'has grad-

_uated from the realm of the ob-

solete to that of the antique. ‘
Bell Aircraft has now come up

with the X-1A, a ship similar to
the X—1 in appearance but con-
taining within its sleek fuselage
a shrieking rocket engine of even
greater potential than the X-1's.

Impossible Done Again

Douglas has almost completely
escaped therealm of possibility
with the unveiling of its newest
supersonic research plane. This
ship, the X—3, contains two jet
engines and ‘ is designed for
speeds of 2000 miles per hour!
The ﬁrst photos of this craft have
just been released and it is still
hard to believe it.

The X—3 weighs as much as a
twin engined commercial airliner
and is as long. But in order to
gain all possible speed, the en-
gineers have given this pencil
thin ship only a 22 foot wing-
span to support its 66 foot length.

The short wingspan means
simply that the plane won't ﬂy
unless it is going very fast; Con-
sequently, the X-3 must land at a

speed of 300 miles _per hour! As ,

Pilot Bridgeman says, “The prob-
lem of trying to keep a plane in
the air while it is ﬂying faster
than the speed of sound has been
licked. The problem now is to
keep it in the air at less than 760
miles per hour!”

Player's Offering Is Termed ‘Good Fare'

.By* Henry Lange

. I
For an hour or so last evening

I believed that the Pitt. Players
had really picked a bad one.
Mind you, not a bad play but a
very bad casting and presenta-
tion of an excellent satire. But
with the second scene of the sec-

ond. act,‘ I was forced to reverse‘

my earlier opinions. The Players
pulled “The Male" Animal,” by
James’ Thurber and Elliot Nu-
gent, out of the ﬁre and the fare
was well done. . A

The ﬁrst act is slow and awk-
wardly handled. One needs the
whole ﬁrst actto become accus-
tomed to the color and decor of
Professor’ Turner’s living room.
The stage crew’ has-done a fine
job in reproducing the marble
walls of the interior of a huge
public washroom, or the famed

.. subways of Moscow, which‘ are
reputed to resemble the same
thing.

By the middle of the second

act, thecreeping action and dia-

-logue begin to give way to some
real Thurbian comedy. The great

‘ humorist’s views on modern day
\
. ' ‘V

marriage and education are clev-
erly written in, i.n his usual
satirical way.

The play deals with a pro-
fessor at Midwestern University
during the administration of “that
crazy man in the White House”-—
l940. During the ’30s a “Red”
scare swept the country, and lib-
eral educators and scholars were
either forced into retirement or
hiding, by “stadium building
trustees.” Professor Turner re-

fuses to back down‘before the.

trustees or aformer football hero

and suitor of his wife. The male

animal resists!

AJay Dantry plays Professor
Turner in a ﬁne manner.‘ His
drunken scene is excellent and
very realistic and shows consci-
entious practice. His wife, as
portrayed by George Ann Ben-
nett is lifeless at times but whole-
some. As for Nancy Schwinn’s

portrayal of her sister, her dra-
matic expressions and deliver-
tance of lines are among the best.‘
Barbara Zinman as the maid,
is comical, but a littlelover-dra-_
matic at times._ Wally Myers, the

current campus football hero is
ably portrayed by Sheldon Camp-
bell, in a typical football player’s
attitude. ‘Maurice Hardaker is
the bookwormish Dean 01‘ the

English Department, but a little,

topmuch so, in his interruption
of the role. In his interpretation
of therole, Stephen Patrick’s fine
performance of a free-speaking
college editor and intellectual is
excellent. He makes a capable
drinking partner for the Pro-
fessor. ’

Lawrie Rosenstiel does a cred-
itable job in the role of Mrs. Tur-
ner’s former suitor. Except for
size and build, Serge Daniels does
well as, the trustee, Ed -Keler.
The role actually needs a short,
heavy—set fellow, made up to
look over 'ﬁfty—-as trustees are
supposed, to appear. Mr. Daniels
is not the type.

Of course, Mr. Harvey Pope is
the able director, with an able
assisting staff, except where men-
tioned previously. Those living
room walls and furnishings may

_be necessary, due to the inade-

quate wage of a college pro-

nfessor, (Trustees take note!)

“Each day I learn a new’
facet of American life and I
am still busy formulating!

opinions,” says Peter J. Van —

Heteren, smiling young gradu-
ate student from the Netherlands.

Van He-teren’s main reason for
being in this country is, according
to him, “. .. . to see what makes up
the American way of thinking and 1
living." Approximately half of his:
time‘ is spent as an assistant in-
structor inthe chemistry labs at
Pitt while the other half is spent
in studying. I “

First impressions are often last-
ing but, as Van Heteren says, “I
overcame the ﬁrst impressions of
rolled shirt sleeves and lack of
neckties as I realized that these
people have a great sense of duty
and go about their business in a
practical and very efficient man-
ner.” ’

Contrasting Impressions

Since he is studying and living
at a large University, Van Het-
eren’s early impressions dealt with
contrasting the educational facil-
ities and systems of the United
States and Holland. These impres-
sions he summed up by -saying
that, “The American University
ten.ds toward a more practical
course of study than the Euro-
pean University.” '
' “In the (American)' University
the student is taught a great num-
ber of things which help him to

_ render direct‘ service to the pro-

g_ress an.d stability of the sur-
rounding democratic society.” In
Holland the student studies fo
the sake of studying. '

Van Heteren is impressed with
the size of -our Universities al-
though he does not believe that a
University should be judged by
its size. “. . . it (size) shows that

‘a large amount of money has been

spent on education and a great
deallof interest has been shown.

 This "is a good thing.”

Not a Duty to Learn
In one respect however, he
thinks that it is too bad that
 . . modern education needs so

much money ‘for its function since -

money, with its materialistic
background, interferes‘ so easily
with the pureness of knowledge
itself. The service which society
expects to receive for its invest-

,ment makes learning a duty.”

“The scope of a University is
tending toward the professional
(M.I.T. or Carnegie Tech) were
specialization results in higher re-
turns for the benefactors money.”
In contrast, say Van Heteren, “The
Universities in Holland stress the
difference between studying and
learning. The student must‘ be re-
served and act as one who has

Deac9__g_1s Loom as Dark Horse‘;
Wake Forest, Sparked   

By Hemric, Rules South

By CARROLL COOK

Wake Forest, a team which specializes in upsetting the
dope sheets, and Bradley,‘ striving for the top after two
years of mediocrity, make their initial appearances tonight

at the Field House.

The unbeaten Wake Forest Dea-
cons (4-0), still beaming over
their 12-point triumph over na-
tionally eighth-ranked North Car-
olina State, might give Duquesne
unexpected trouble and, although
most fans feel the Dukes will win
in a breeze; Coach Dudey Moore
is not quite as conﬁdent.

The Deacons have proved more
than once that the dopesters do
not know what they are talking
about. Last »March, Wake Forest
became the first team besides
North Carolina State to win the
Southern Conference Tournament.
In the ﬁnals, Wake Forest edged

I ‘ NCS, 71-70. However, in the NCAA

playoffs, Holy Cross eliminated
Wake Forest in the ﬁrst round,
79-71. Earlier in the season, the
Deacons had whipped the Cru-
saders in the Dixie Classic.

Wake Forest’s chief threat is all-
American candidate Dick Hemric,
who scored 727 point last season
for an average of 25.1.

Although Bradley has won its
share, of games in the past, the
Braves are usually thought of in
terms of the famous basketball
scandal which rocked the country

. two years ‘ago.

In 1950, Bradley lost to CCNY
in the ﬁnals of the NIT and the
NCAA, and the next year was
again invited to play in post-sea-
son tournaments. However, at

that time, Long Island and CCNY
players had already been indicted
for ﬁxing basketball games.

The Bradley players voted 11-0
to refuse bids to any post-season
games and then decided to hold
their own tournament at their ﬁeld
house. Duquesne lost to Wyom-
ing in the ﬁrst round. A few
months later, the news came out
that Bradley was also involved in
ﬁxing games. Thebig player was
Gene “Squeaky” Melchiorre, “:30
was named, for shaving point
spreads in several games.

Since that fateful day, Coach
Forrest Anderson has waited pa-
tiently uptil the time Bradley will
again bé a national powerhouse.
This could be the year and, un-
fortunately for the Pitt’s Bradley
plans to make them victim number
two. ’

Steel Pioduction Proggesses with Research

CompaniesSponSorProgram Here

By JOHN De NINNO
Fourth of a Series

In 1942 a group of companies

who manufactured acid open
hearth steel established at

Pitt a research program call-
ed the Acid Open Hearth Re-

-search Association.

These companies felt that the
problems and progress _of their
steel producing process could best
be furthered by cooperative re-
search. The association was there-
fore inc0rpor- '
ated into a non-'
proﬁt corpora-

its r e s e a r c h
here, through
the Department _
of Metallurgic
al Engineering. .

In the eleven;
year history of:

. lems have been

1 investigated and solved, to the
~ beneﬁt of the steel industry. Two
~ such problems are concerned with
< measurement of molten steel tem-

‘ peratures _and the determination

,\

  

of liquid slag ﬂuidity.

Results ‘ of investigations into

“these problems have particularly

beneﬁted member companies in
the development of process con-
trol procedures and have offered
a study of possible economies of
operation.

The word acid in “acid open
hearth” indicates that the lining
on the bottom of the furnace,
upon which the molten steel rests,
is tightly packed sand, an acidic
substance. Other furnaces called
basic open hearth have a basic
lining, such as lime.

Old Methods Inaccurate

In the past the measurement’ of
steel temperatures in a furnace
has been diiﬁctilt since ordinary
measuring devices melt before
they’ get as high as the actual tem-
perature within. the furnace.
Sometimes the measuring devices
picked up impurities from the
steel making accuracy impossible.

The research association took an

-old method of measuring temper-

atures and improved upon it.

iThis, method was ﬁrst devised by

a Frenchmanwnamed Le Chatelier,

and; is called the Le Chatelierl
thermocouple. ﬁt consists of two ‘a.

platinum wires. One is 90% plat-
inum, the other is pure.

Finishes New Book

William Schulz, J12, prolessor in
Pitt’s law school, is the author of
a new book entitled “Conservation
Law and Administration. Publish-
ed by the Ronald Press Company,
New York, this book is the only
complete study on the state level
of the_ legal and administrative
machinery for regulating natural
resources. » '

Research and writing for the
book, a case history of law and
resource use in Pennsylvania,
was done at the Pitt School “of
Law under a grant from The Con-
servation Foundation. The work
provides background information
on conservation and recreation
planning at all levels.

A model .Conservati‘on Admin-
istration Act is included in the
book.

connected to a voltmeter. The
welded end is placed in the hot
steel and registers its temperature.
This way the temperature of a
good heat is determined and us-
ing it as a basis the temperature
for all heats can be determined.
. Pig Iron, Scrap Added

A “heat” is the mass of liquid
steel in one batch of steel in a
furnace and is made by charging
the furnace with steel scrap, and
pig iron. An excess of carbon is
present in the pig iron. After the
charge has been in the furnace for
some time the carbon content is
reduced and comes off as carbon
monoxide gas.

The carbon is then down to its
desired content’ and ~ manganese
and silicon are added. Molten
steel is formed and is tapped from
the furnace into ladles, then from
the ladles into molds forming in-
gots. T ' .

Dependent on the carbon con-

tent the temperature found to be‘

most suitable was 2900 degrees
Fahrenheit. ‘ ,
Correct Temperature Important
Advantages in knowing the cor-
rect temperature for a heat are
most important during the reﬁning
period. If the steel is too cold it
will be too hard to get into ingot
form; if it is too hot the steel will
be inferior and the excessively

LATEST COLLEGE

high temperature will-wear out
the molds faster. ‘

The other problem, that of de-
termination of slag ﬂuidity, was
similarly investigated.

Slag in an ‘acid open hearth is a
mixture of iron oxide, manganese
oxide, and silican diovide. It is not
common to make a chemical anal-
ysis of the slag but by its ﬂuidity
(ﬂowability) its composition can
be determined. Through experi-
ence you can tell what ﬂuidity is
good for a heat of steel.

As a result the amount of iron
ore needed for a heat can be de-
termined ‘since’ it regulates the
fluidity. Also the amount of man-
ganese lost to slag can be deter-
mined by the measurement of the
slag’s ﬂuidity.

Directed by Engineering Head

The above research and similar«
projects are under the direction
of the Engineering Research Divi-
sionheaded by Dr. G. R. Fitterer,
dean of the schools of Engineering
and Mines.

In addition to Dean Fitterer the
staff consists of James G. Basset,

and James W. Dougherty, Jr., re-

search engineers. Much of the in-
formation used in this article was
supplied by Mr. Bassett and Rob-*
ert King, assistant professor of
metallurgical engineering.

 
   

Phi Eta Sigma Taps
14 to Membership

Phi Eta Sigma, National fresh-
man scholastic fraternity, tapped
13 undergraduates and one hon-
orary initiate, last Thursday night,
"Dec. 3, in the facultyclub.

Preceding an initiation banquet,
the following persons took part in
the membership ritual: George J.
Arth, Jr.; Leonard Epstein; Ben
G, Frank; Edward Gascoine; Ger-
ald A. Haluck; John J. Jones;
James R. Kisega; Lawrence P.
McName; Frank J .‘ Mattes; Donald
A. Miller; Ralph D. Natale; Irving
N. Rothman; and Robert A. Sed-
ler. Dr. Elmer G. Braper, head
of the Poltical Science department
was the honorary initiate.

Dr. Graper delivered the major
address of the evening on the
topic, ‘fWhat should college edu-

cation do?” He emphasi_zed that
a college education should develop
a broad tolerance in students.

They should receive a good lib-
eral arts education in preparation
for specialization, Dr. Graper con-
tinued. He added that students
should be able to weigh and value
the information they receive to
lessen false prejudices that exist
today.

Emil Herman, Phi Eta Sigma

president, spoke to the initiates
on their obligations to the organi-
zation concerning tutoring services
and ‘scholastic attainments. ,

Requirements for ‘ admission to

‘Phi Eta Sigma are a 2.5 Q.P.A;

in the ﬁrst semester of the—fresh-
man year or an overall 2.5 Q.P.A.
in the ﬁrst year.
