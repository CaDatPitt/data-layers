VOLUME EIGHTY, ISSUE THIRTY

By Dan Bates
News - Editor

The University of Pittsburgh has
suspended the Omega Psi Phi fraterni-
ty pending a hearing for an alleged haz-
ing incident which resulted in the in-
jury of two fraternity pledges.

The pledges, Pitt sophomore Joel
Christian and Duquesne University stu-

lent Kevin Jenkins, were slapped
across their heads during a fraternity
ritual, Christian alleged. Consequent-
ly, Christian’s left eardrum was rup-
tured, and J enkinssuffered a fractured
jaw, he said. The alleged incident oc-
curred in Lothrop Hall on Nov. 1.

Christian would not disclose any fur-
ther details, but he did implicate frater-
nity member Hudson Primus in the in-
cident. Primus could not be reached for
comment. However, in an earlier in-
terview with Primus concerning the in-
cident, he said he was unaware of any

debated last night in the William Pitt

Union Assembly Room before a live-

ly standing-room-only crowd. The

debate, entitled ‘Yippie vs. Yuppie,

The Idealism of the ’60s vs. The

Idealism of the ’80s,’ often became a"
shouting match between Hoffman and

Rubin.

Rubin, a one-time radical who now
runs a business in Manhattan, said the
baby-boom generation “is knocking on
the door of authority, ” and when they
do take authority and begin running
America “we can begin the adventure
of fulﬁlling what we started in the ’60s,
but from a position of power.” The
conservatively dressed Rubin opened
his remarks by referring to his’
anonymity during the ’70s.
“Everywhere I went nobody recog-
nized me, so I got one of these,”said
Rubin as he pulled out an American
Express card.

During his 25-minute opening
remarks Rubin characterized the hip-
pies of the anti-war movement during
the ’60s as being “Rambos of the left.”
He said new groups like women and
minorities are entering the business
world in greater numbers than ever
before and that the Yuppie generation
is interested in ‘self-improvement’ and

responsibilities. ”

hazing. “It’s news to me,” said
Primus. “As far as I’m concerned,

everything is ﬁne. Nothing is wrong.” _

Primus is president of’ the Black Ac-
tion Society.

The alleged incident is being in-
vestigated by the Ofﬁce of Student Ac-
tivities, and a hearingdateihas been set
for Monday, Nov. 11., according to
Activities Director Andrew Smith. He
said the hearing will be directed toward
the'Omega Psi Phi fraternity and not
toward any individuals who may have
been implicated in the incident.

Rubin debate personal value differences  p

‘becoming authority,’ _not__in destroy-
ing authority as the Yippies were.

Hoffman began his opening address
to thunderous applause from the au-
dience and clearly remained the
crowd’s favorite throughout the eve-
ning. Hoffman said, “American Ex-
press wou1dn’t trust me with one of
their little cards for 10 minutes.” ‘He
said that far from still being the radical
hippie, opposed to everything as he was
in the ’60s, he now is a socially con-
cerned individual who “pays taxes, has
three kids and hemorrhoids.”

Hoffman ﬁrst recounted the many.
social causes he involves himself with
today and attacked the values of the
Yuppie mindset and occasionally Rubin
himself. “I carried Jerry through the
’60s,” Hoffman said, “and I’ll carry

Presently, no formal charges have been
ﬁled against the fraternity.

The university administration has
become involved in the investigation
because hazing is against university
policy, as well as the policies of the Na-
tional Interfraternity and National
Panhellenic Conferences‘.

The policy states: “All acts of haz-
ing by a chapter, any member or alum-
ni, are speciﬁcally forbidden. ...This
includes all types of corporal punish-
ment, any action that would place a
person in peril, any action which in-

him through the ’80s.”

“The Yuppies are not for real,”
Hoffman continued. “They are a
media- created mythology to make peo-
ple buy new and more things. This is
the era of the designer brain. Jerry’s
favorite words seem to be new, new,
new instead of good, good, good.”

Rubin repeated throughout the night
that America is on the brink of a wide-
ranging societal change brought on by
the Yuppies coming promotion to the
upper echelon of business and govern-
ment. He said that Yuppies weaned on
the ideals of the ’60s will ﬁnally be able
to accomplish that which was only
dreamed about twenty years ago with
their newfound power.

During the audience-question portion
of the debate the two men seemed to
let the old passion of the ’60s rise to

volves physical exhaustion or abuse,
any activity of a dangerous, rude or
degrading nature...”

The university takes a strong stance
against hazing, Smith said. “Hazing
deﬁnitely goes against the philosophies
of education. It is a deterrent of the
retention of students, and students can-
not adequately perform their academic
responsibilities,” said Smith. He add-
ed that the university is “simply not go-
ing to tolerate hazing.”

' Assistant Activities Director Bridget
Guernsey, who is the Greek advisor,
is also investigating the alleged inci-
dent. “I’m overprotective [of the
Greeks], but if any fraternity would do
this [hazing], I’d be appalled,” said
Guernsey. She added that hazing has
no place in the fraternity system.

“Does hazing make him a better
brother?” she asked.

Pitt’s Interfraternity Council also
frowns on hazing. IFC President Craig
Strauss said hazing “brings down the

the surface as’ they began yelling and
calling each other names.

“That’s bullshit,” Hoffman yelled at
one point.

“The man can’t control his emo-
tions,” Rubin said to the audience.
“You’re Mr. Ego,” Rubin said to
Hoffman.

“He doesn’t get angry,” Hoffman
deadpanned. “He got ESTed.”

The debate lasted well over two
hours and pleased the packed room
which ranged in audience from infants
to hippies who still haven’t cut their
hair. The debate produced no clear
‘winner,’ with both- men advancing
their views forcefully, clearly and with
a touch of fun about who they were,
who they are now and what they are
each trying, through very different
means, to become.

whole concept of fraternities. The com-

'munity already has a somewhat

negative image of fraternities, so haz-
ing is something we do not need.”

Strauss said the IFC has had no re-
cent problems with alleged hazing.
“Hazing went out a long time ago,”
he‘ said.

According to Article XI of the IFC
Bylaws, “No chapter shall allow any
of its pledges, members or other per-
sons to participate in any hazing
ceremony, activity or practice.”
However, the IFC is not involved with
the investigation since the alleged in-
cident involves a violation of univer-
sity policy.

The university receives an estimated
10 reports of alleged hazing each year,
Smith pointed out. Each allegation is
then investigated, and the fraternity in-
volved must appear at a hearing. -

However, no fraternities have been
found guilty of hazing since March 25,

Mumma beats Taylor in landslide  

By David Zafris
Staff Writer
and

Laureen Cauley

For The Pitt News

Jim Mumma defeated Dan Taylor
last night with a landslide victory in the
race for the ofﬁce of student govern-
ment board president. The ﬁnal elec-
tion results tallied 1,511 votes for

Mumma to 810 for Taylor, the largest
margin of victory for a SGB president

. in four years.

After the votes were tabulated and
the winners determined, Mumma said
he was conﬁdent and not surprised with
the results.

“I’m happy with the results,” said
Mumma. “I think the students made a
good choice. I did a lot of campaign-
ing. I went through the Towers and
dormitories a lot and I stood outside
both days of elections and worked
hard, passing out leaﬂets. I think that
was the key.”

Dan Taylorlalso said that he was not
surprised by the extent of the outcome.

“I had strong inclinations in the past
week or so that things weren’t looking
as good as I would have hoped for the
campaign,” he said. “But we’re all
working to the same end of more stu-
dent representation. I certainly will be
around to lend any assistance. Jim ran
a good campaign. I’m disappointed but
I’m ready to move on.”

Since there are no returning board
members from last year, current SGB
president Luke Kluchko said that he
believes Mumma will have a challeng-
ing time in ofﬁce.

“Jim has a very special task ahead
of him,” said Kluchko. “He has a very
young and a very, let’s not say inex-
perienced, but unknowledgable board.
I think, however, that they will work
well together.”

Despite the introduction of the new ‘

voting machines, election committee
ofﬁcials were disappointed with the low
voter turnout. “We were hoping that
the new voting machines would en-
courage the students to vote, ” said Lin-
da Bodner, chairperson of the SGB
elections committee. “However, we’re
afraid the machines may have scared
them of .” :

Columbian courthouse seige ends after bloody battle

Columbia — Unconﬁrmed radio
reports said yesterday that there was a
bloody end to a 27-hour siege at the

7 Supreme Court building in Bogota.

The reports said security forces
rushed leftist rebel holdouts who had
tied sticks of dynamite to their bodies.
The Supreme Court president and rebel
leader are reported dead, but police,
army and defense spokesman are refus-
ing to comment on the situation.

A police spokesman at the scene said
the man identified as the leader of the
takeover was captured or killed during
an assault marked by numerous explo-
sions possibly caused by dynamite as
the rebels were shot.

Witnesses said leftist guerillas shot
their way into the Supreme Court
building Wednesday, killing as many
as 29 and taking 70 court employees
hostage. Authorities rescued a number
of workers Thursday, and it is unclear
how many were freed in the attack.

Collins marries
for fourth time

LAS VEGAS, Nev. — TV vixen
Joan Collins from “Dynasty” has add-
ed a diamond studded wedding ring to
her left hand.

"The popular actress was married in
a private ceremony Wednesday even-
ing to Swedish ﬁlm executive Peter
Holm. It was the fourth marriage for
the 50-year-old Collins.

A publicist described the ceremony
as traditional, with Collins wearing a
silk crepe dress and carrying a bouquet
of lilies and roses. The 39-year-old
groom presented her with a half-inch-
wide ring studded with diamonds.
Tomorrow night, the couple will host
a private black-tie reception for 50
close friends at Collins’ Beverly Hills
home.

Transplant patient ‘
remains critical

HERSHEY — Heart transplant pa-
tient Anthony Mandia, who is battling
an infection, remains in critical and
unstable condition at Hershey Medical
Center. Medical center spokesman Carl
Andrews said the 44-year-old
Philadelphia man spent yesterday
resting and visiting with _family
members.

The infection is the latest in a series
of complications for Mandia since the
Penn State artiﬁcial heart was removed
from his chest Oct. 29 and replaced
with a human heart. Andrews said

Mandia is responding to medicine he
is being given for his infection, and his
heart is performing well despite the
strain.

He was taken back to the operating
room Wednesday where an abcess near
his heart was drained and other pro-
cedures were performed. Mandia was
the first person to receive the new

A model artiﬁcial heart. It stayed in his

chest for 10'/2 days until a donor heart
was found.

Reagan appoints
Health secretary

WASHINGTON — President

. Reagan has named former governor

Otis Bowen the ﬁrst doctor ever chosen
to become secretary of Health and
Human Services. The announcement
was slipped in during a picture-taking
session at the Oval Ofﬁce yesterday.

Reagan said he chose the 67-year-old
Republican conservative (nicknamed
Doc) ‘ ‘because of all the qualiﬁcations
he has in excess.” Bowen is a former
country doctor who teaches at the In-
diana University School of Medicine.
He was Indiana’s ﬁrst two-terrn gover-
nor and was a leader in the state
legislature. He has advised both
Democratic and Republican presidents.

Bowen said he does not think the
controversy from 1981 will hurt his
conﬁrmation vote in the Senate because

4 he claimed he has “done nothing il-
legal.” That was the year he told an
American Medical Association conven-
tion that he gave an unapproved drug
to his wife, who was dying of cancer,
to relieve her pain.

Helms subpoenas
Soviet seaman

NORTH CAROLINA — Republican
Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina
has issued an Agriculture Committee
subpoena that could pry sailor Miroslav
Medvid off a Soviet grain ship in the
Mississippi River. A committee staff
member said Helms dispatched the
committee’s deputy counsel to New
Orleans yesterday afternoon to attempt

to serve the papers.

The move comes on the same day
that a State Department ofﬁcial told
Congress the Soviet sailor, who twice
jumped ship, was competent when he
made his decision to return home dur-
ing a meeting with U.S. ofﬁcials.

Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne
Ridgeway acknowledged to a house
panel that she believes Medvid
originally had intended to defect and

Ridgeway called congressional efforts
to retrieve Medvid from his freightor
in Louisiana “unnecessary and ill-

Protestors in Louisiana yesterday
circled Medvid’s ship on the Mississip-

Soviets apparently had changes of heart

ANC member exp

By Michael Ashford
Assistant News Editor

In 1974 the African National Con-
gress (ANC) gained observer status at
the United Nations after the South
African government delegation lost its
voting rights in the U.N. General
Assembly.

Shuping Coapoge, a South African
and member of the ANC at the U.N.,

spoke yesterday about the history of in- —

stitutional racism in South Africa and
current trends in the black resistance
movement in the face of what he
described as imminent revolutionary
change in South Africa. ~

After winning independence from
Britain, Coapoge explained, the South
African government wrote racism in-
to the preamble of its constitution of
1910: “With the abdicating power,
they wrote, ‘There shall be no equali-
ty between white and black in the
church and state.’ ”

With the status of British protec-

. torate, Coapoge continued, the South

African government passed the Land
Act of 1915 which gave ownership and
control of 87 percent of the land to the
white minority and 13 percent of the
land to blacks. The ANC, Coapoge
said, was responsible for convincing
the British Parliament to retain the in-
dependence of Lesotho, Botswana and
Swaziland when the South African
government tried to incorporate those

countries into the Land Act of 1919.

Furthennore, the South African
government enacted the Civilized
Labor Act of 1927, which barred
blacks from membership in any unions
and from striking . An amendment in
1973 allowed the formation of ex-
clusively black unions, but only on the
condition that black workers do not

‘strike without the permission of the

minister of labor.

Coapoge noted that the black labor
movement in South Africa is active in
the movement for emancipation of
black workers, but almost all conces-
sions from management were condi-
tioned upon compromises from the
black unions. If the union refuses to
compromise, the management calls in
national police to break strikes. In
addition, Coapage said, labor leaders
have been tried for treason under ac-
cusations of being in alliance with the
banned ANC. “The government in
South Africa has the right without
recourse to courts to take an individual
from‘ one area and put him in ‘banish-
ment’ without communication to the
outside world,” Coapoge said.

Also, because blacks may not live in
designated white areas, all black
workers are considered “migrant
labor,” coming from their respective
homelands. This status denies black
workers all the beneﬁts and security
which workers enjoy elsewhere in the
world. Each year, Coapoge said,
workers must return to their homes and

1 1981, when the administration chose to

revoke the charter of the Alpha Phi
Alpha fraternity for three years.
According to a report in The Pitt

ly paddled a pledge, causing back

bruises and kidney damage. The pledge
was subsequently sent to Mercy

Hospital. The pledge was also a student 7'

of Duquesne University. The fraterni-
ty was» reinstated last year. .

If the Omega Psi Phi fraternity is
found guilty of hazing, Smith said, the
fraternity may lose its charter at Pitt
permanently.

renew their contracts.

Speaking on the makeup of the South
African government, Coapoge re-
counted the activity of the Dutch whites
during WWII. Dutch whites pro-
claimed their allegiance to Nazi Ger-
many and committed acts of sabotage
and terrorism. Some of them, Coapoge
said, were tried and sentenced to death
for acts of treason.

“These are the people [the
Afrikaaners] we are talking about to-
day; they are the ex-Nazis or neo-
Nazis,” Coapage said. They adopted
a national ﬂag very similar to the Nazi
swastika, saying, “Our political system
maybe called undemocratic. In Italy
they called it fascism, in Germany
Nazism — in South Africa we call it
Christian Nationalism,” Coapoge re-
counted. The Christian Nationalists at
that time called for a state of white
economic and social supremacy.

In 1948, Coapoge said, South
African President Botha’s party enacted
a series of laws which “were explicit-
ly reﬁned forms of the race laws passed
in Nazi Germany between 1935 and
1938.” These laws prohibit, among

' other things, all marriages of mixed
race, while at the same time declaring
all existing mixed-race marriages null
and void. The children of the affected
couples, Coapoge said, were divided
up to other families according to the
darkness of their skin.

Another important law was the
Group Separation Act of 1948, which

4.1.-

legislated the complete separation of
South African people along racial lines.
Together with the existing Land Act,
Coapoge pointed out, this meant that
all blacks would be forced to live on
17 percent of the land.

Coapoge criticized those who ad-
vocate reform in South Africa by citing
this historical process which institu-
tionalized racism early in the century.
He noted that the Rev. Sullivan, author
of the Sullivan Principles, has reversed

his position on the very policies he had '

written; Sullivan has stated that if no
progress is made in reforming the
government within the next two years,
he will urge economic sanctions on
businesses with branches in South
Africa.

“According to the laws of South
Africa, just like in Nazi Germany no
good German could work under a Jew,
no white person will work under the
leadership of a black person. That is
the law.” “

Coapoge reiterated that South
African laws enacted by the Afrikaan
and British whites ensure that there can
be no equal opportunity for blacks, no
possibility of social desegregation and
no chance of black workers receiving
pay equal to their white colleagues.

“White labor unions take the pay in-
creases black workers deserve and give
them to. white workers, ” Coapoge said.
“We could go all along the line and
crush every attempt by these [Sullivan]

 

Principles. They just cannot work
within the context of racist South
Africa.” -

Speaking on the recent talks between
South African business leaders and the
ANC, Coapoge said business in South
Africa is aware of the danger in
economic stability caused by the
govemment’s intractability. “There is
nothing good for them in their long-run
outlook.” The South African Chamber
of Commerce, Coapoge said, has
called on the government to do
something about the growing crisis or
resign because of the damage it is caus-
ing to the economy.

Coapoge urged‘ popular activism in
the United States to put pressure on our
government to enact stronger sanctions
against South Africa: “We hope that
people will get fed up with apartheid
and the policy of constructive engage-
ment. ”

The ANC is the main political
representative of the black resistance
movement in South Africa. In 1960 it
was banned by the South African
government; since then their head-
quarters in exile has been based in
Lusaka, Mozambique.

Describing his understanding of the
ANC, Coapoge said, “We are not

about - civil rights’, we are about

freedom and the destruction of apar-
theid — we are about the formation of
a non-racial democratic South Africa.”

Student Safety

As we are all probably aware, the Oakland
area can be hostile to students, especially those
who reside in off-campus housing. The prospect
of evening walks to Hillman Library, Trees
Hall, the dormitories or any number of points
in north and south Oakland poses grave dangers
to the personal well—being of venturesome
students.

According to statistics acquired from the Pitts-
burgh Police through September of this year,
there have been 15 reported incidents of rape
and a total of 247 documented cases of ag-
gravated and simple assault in the Oakland area.
Last year the numbers were 17 and 308,
respectively.

The university has a responsibility to do its

V utmost to provide for the security of all of its

students. Naturally, there will always be safety

problems; budget constraints limit what the

. university can attempt, and neither the campus
nor the city police are omniscient.

However, we do not feel that it would be an
unreasonable drain on university resources to
provide an evening escort service for students
wishing to journey throughout the Oakland area.
The ﬁnancial burden such a proposal would im-
pose is not unpalatable if it decreases the risk
of attacks on students.

Certainly, _the expenses involved in such a
venture make more sense and are more
justiﬁable than those entailed in the recent
renovation of the Cathedral lawn. After all, we
must have our priorities, mustn’t we?

Farrakhan Issue:
Pro and Con

One day we will all learn that hatred
is the problem, not the solution. BAS
is currently part of the problem.

The BAS is hardly being original in
mimicking the scapegoating of Jews
that whites and others have been
responsible for for centuries. Sure, it
can make you feel better to hate — it
evidently makes Klan and Nazi party
members feel better. That black_s have
a tremendous number of reasons for
anger is unquestionable. But BAS’
decision to support Louis Farrakhan,
who calls Hitler “wickedly great.” is
not great at all but merely wicked. It
is also senseless. —

If you were a black in Nazi Ger-
many, don’t you know that you would
have been murdered just as fast as the
Jews were?

If a Jewish organization were to use
your student fees to sponsor a speaker
who called black culture _a “gutter”
culture and admired lynch mobs as
“wickedly great," how would you Far-
rakhan supporters feel? What would
you think about thisorganization and
its supporters?

If you have any honesty, you will ad-
mit that you’d feel just like I do about
your Farrakhan lecture: hurt, angry
and disgusted.

Michele Feingold
Graduate School of Social Work ’86

First of all, it is necessary to get a
clear picture of what the real issues are
regarding Minister Farrakhan’s visit to
the University of Pittsburgh. It is my
understanding that Mr. Farrakhan was
invited to speak on the topic of black
nationalism, within the context of the
current economic and social state of
blacks in America.»

A cursory glance at a few statistics
will tell us the current socioeconomic
state of blacks in America is simply too
critical to turn a deaf ear to anyone
claiming to have an answer. Unem-
ployment among blacks hovers at
around twice the national average.
Unemployment among black youth
ranges anywhere from 25 to 40 per-
cent, depending upon whose ﬁgures
you trust. Nearly 40 percent of the
black elderly are living below the
poverty line; and chances are greater
that a black man between the ages of
18 and 35 will either “do time” or die
a victim of foul play at the hands of his
“brother,” than obtain a college
degree. F

If Mr. Farrakhan has an agenda for
solving these problems, it behooves not
only blacks but also whites to listen.
For, not to be insensitive or callous

sounding but simply to state the issue.

in terms of today’s concerns, it would

be more cost-efﬁcient to ﬁnd a solu-

tion to the problems affecting blacks to-
ay than not to.

However, it is not surprising that the
invitation extended to Mr. Farrakhan
by the Black Action Society to speak
at the University of Pittsburgh has
drawn such emphatic criticism. After
all, these are the 1980s and not the
1960s, although I do not hold up the
1960s as a period of recent history
beyond reproach either. However, if
for no other reason, the 1960s are
laudable because college campuses
throughout this country at that time
were one of the few places agitation,
confrontation and often violation of the
law were understood as legitimate
means to demonstrate the horrendous
plight of the underclass and dispos-
sessed. Also, and more importantly,
because of such demonstrations of
outrage, some minds and attitudes were
changed, and eventually historically en-
trenched and blatantly terroristic prac-
tices and oppressive laws were
changed.

Today it seems the conservative tide
that has swept across the country has
managed to shipwreck our sensitivity
to the less fortunate ones next door.
Even the infrequent visitor of a local
food bank will tell you there seems to
be a glut on guns, but the amount of
butter he gets will barely last through
half a loaf of bread. Now it seems what
ﬁrst began, in all probability, as a
natural “conservative” concern for
how manyjzeros after the dollar sign
[a person] was losing to Uncle Sam and
grew to include the attitude, “I’m will-
ing to get tough with the Russians no
matter the costs at home (as long as
those costs don’t affect my home!)” has

~ now consumed many to the point that

it is difﬁcult for others to voice discon-
tent and not be accused of fanning the
ﬂames of “sensationalistic rabble-
rousing. ’ ’ (Cox, ‘ ‘BAS Irresponsible, ’ ’
The Pitt News, Oct. 28.)

The mood of the times seems to in-
dicate that on some college campuses
today, demonstrations which violate the
law are thought an outrage, [and] con-
frontation is the strategy of those who
are simply confrontational and agita-
tion an irresponsible act by agitators.
I don’t beg to differ but proclaim with
pride in the words of Frederick
Douglass, ‘ ‘Those who profess to favor
freedom, and yet deprecate agitation,
are men who want crops without plow-
ing up the ground. They want the ocean
without the awful roar of its many
waters." ‘

To claim to support the right of BAS
and Mr. Farrakhan to hold their opin-
ions — and then presume to know not
only what is best for the black com-
munity of the University of Pittsburgh
but alsowhat is best for all of black
America, and apparently, which
leaders are best for the black communi-
ty — turns an ocean of support into

nothing more than a leaky faucet-like

homily. If America believes and
chooses a second-rate ex-actor best ﬁt-
ted to lead her and articulate her
policies and positions on sensitive and
controversial domestic and interna-
tional issues, who that is not an
American citizen can judge choice? If
some or all of black America believes
and chooses Mr. Farrakhan — with all
that has been written and said about the
man — as one best equipped to ar-
ticulate their plight, who but black
America can judge the reasonableness
of such a choice?

Still, the fact that black America is
better able than others to judge the
reasonableness of the choice of its

leaders does not make the question .

“Why Farrakhan?” an illegitimate
one. It is simply the kind of question
which demonstrates that one has either
forgotten, misperceived or chosen to
evade the real issues.

The Pitt News, November 8, 1985 -

Now This Won ’t

It was just the other day that I was
mapping out my next semester. You
know how it is. I got out a piece of
paper, a pen and of course my beloved
copy of the University of Pittsburgh
Schedule of Classes. I ﬂipped to the in-
dex. “Let’s see — Special Service
Fees, Tuition bills,” and out of the cor-
ner of my eye I see, “Choosing a long
distance company is a lot like  con-
trol, control ahhh! Schedule of Class
Index.” I start ﬂipping to page 16.
“Hey, Fiero — niiice, furnished apart-

_ments, huh? And — Thrift Drug????”

It ﬁnally dawned on me that this
thing —- a university publication no less
— is littered with advertising. Follow-
ing a short period of disbelief and a mo-
ment of moral indigestion, I came to
my senses. This is great! Who’da

 

The year is 1995. You’re teaching a

ministration won’t give you a dime.

thought? Of course the class schedule!
Thousands of ‘consuming collegians
leaf through the thing every term. It’s
perfect, just when they don’t suspect
it. The class schedule, why not? When
they’ve got their defenses down.

Then it occurred to me, “This is just
the beginning. This is an idea which
has its best days ahead of it.”

Come on, Pitt! We’re the campus of
the future! Let’s use our imagination!

The year is 1995. You’re teaching

So, what do you do? That’s right, you

OK, so we have to start small, so
what? To earn a few bucks starting out,
at the beginning you’ll hand out a few
painters’ caps emblazoned with the
name of the course and something like:
“Max’s Mini Market Open 24
Hours.” Then let's hand out a couple
of T-shirts for the local plasma bank,
and it wouldn’t do your handouts any
harm if, say, “Sonnie Leone’s Pizza
Delivers’ ’ were stamped on them. Hey,
don’t knock it, Doc. Now you’ve got
a popular-class on your hands and a
skyrocketing budget ta boot! Let’s face

it, you’d be the talk of the campus. 4? A; I I

One year later (here’s the vision):
The Syria Mosque, recently purchased
by the university, is packed. The noise
of thousands of rustling notebooks and

lots of intense gossiping lessen as the ‘

T-shirt and refreshment booths are
disassembled and the announcer walks
on stage. He takes the microphone, and
the lights are turned down. “Ladies,
gentlemen and underclassmen!
Budweiser and Murjani, the people
who brought you the Rolling Stones in

- ’8l, are pleased to present Ted Windt

and Presidential Rhetoric III.”
Needless to say, the excitement is over-
whelming. The kids rush on stage,
chaos breaks out, and the good pro-
fessor is whisked away in his private
h/elicopter.

Political Diaries/Jim Szalla

Let’s Win One For The Gipper

In the Greece of antiquity were born
two traditions which survive to this
day: athletic competition and.
democracy. While these ancients had
a passion for both, they very much held
the latter in the position of supreme im-
portance. However, from a comparison
of ballots cast by Super Bowl viewers,
it would seem that the order is, for us,
reversed. Therefore, in my own
modest way, I shall propose a synthesis
whereby increased participation in the
electoral process will result.

Let’s face it, something as mundane
as voting can hardly compare with the
hoopla imparted to a football game.
When was the last time you came
across a tailgate party outside a voting
booth? Probably never.

For this reason, I propose the im-
mediate adoption of a radical new

system whereby apathy could be quite
easily transformed to zeal because elec-
tions would be used as a means by
which football teams, which would
ultimately vie for political office on the
gridiron, would be elected.

As you might know, our present
electoral system involves two elections
per election year: the primary and the
general elections. Now, whereas voters
are reluctant to go and vote in even one
election, two are most unreasonable.
However, my proposed system would
retain only the primary election.
Although somewhat similar to the cur-
rent system, our new primary election
would require the casting of ballots in
each state for purposes of electing two
partisan football teams, one
Democratic and one Republican, so
that there would be 100 total teams na-
tionwide. With these partisan teams

selected, the first round of play would
be commenced for the establishment of
state governments by having each
state’s Democratic and Republican
teams play against each other in a game
where control of the state government
would go to the victors: The head
coach and his staff would form the ex-
ecutive branch and the players the
legislative. When the new state govern-
ments were in place, the second round
of play would begin to establish the
federal government.

Anyone who is a fan of professional
football is familiar with the NFL’s con-
ference and division structure. Also,
you will recall that we, in our scenario,
have 50 teams that lost in play on the
state level; however, these teams would
be given a second chance here because
it is they who, through an NFL-type

system, would play through a schedule
of games to determine the top two par-
tisan teams. From this point, as at the
state level, these two teams would play
to determine the ‘composition of the
federal government.

I realize that with this system might
come fears that “jocks” are not the
most capable people to trust with the
running of our government, but have
no fear. because there are alreadv ster-
ling examples of this: Former presidents
Eisenhower, Nixon and Ford all played
college football; former basketball star
Bill Bradley is a U.S. senator from
New Jersey; in their primes, John,
Bobby and Teddy Kennedy were avid
players of touch football; President
Ronald Reagan, in addition to his
memorable portrayal of the “Gipper,”

was once a sportscaster; and Supreme

Court Justice Byron “Whizzer”-White
actually played professional football
with the Pittsburgh Steelers. -

Aside from the obvious increase of

participation in the electoral process -

that would be generated by this new
system, another advantage would be
that it has the potential to be ﬁnancial-
ly self-sufﬁcient because those who
now plunk down outrageous amounts
to attend the Super Bowl —— where vic-
tory, though exciting, has no real pro-
found impact upon our society —
would surely do the same to attend
games where the stakes are as signifi-
cant as they would be in these.
However, I realize that most will ﬁnd
the proposal set forth herein as being
absolutely ludicrous, but I will not
rebut because, after all, there is a much
more simple and obvious cure ' for our
electoral ills.

Jazz greats to descend on Pitt

By Paul Anderson

History was in the making one day
about 15 years ago, when Pitt’s new
jazz instructor heard that Art Blakey
and the Jazz Messengers were play-
ing at nearby Crawford Grill. Having
toured Europe with the group less than
a year earlier, Dr. Nathan Davis
grabbed his sax and headed to
Crawford’s Grill for a surprise visit and
reunion jam session.

After the gig, Davis and Blakey, a
native Pittsburgher and one of the
seminal influences in modern jazz
drumming, got to talking. Davis sug-
gested that Blakey come over to Pitt
and talk with the students about jazz.
As Davis reminisces, “We got started

3 with the informal talk and then after the

next year, I started calling up my
friends, and that's how it started. Ac-
tually, it got started by accident, to tell
you the truth.”

What began so casually has
blossomed into what may be the most
prestigious jazz event on the college
scene today. Every November, a
select group of highly-acclaimed jazz
artists descends upon Pitt for a thrill-
ing weekend of jazz music, conversa-
tion and education. During this time,
each artist conducts a free workshop
in which he discusses his style, com-
position strategy and technique, and
fields questions from the assembled

audience of musicians, fans and-

students. Of course the event

culminates on Saturday night at 8 p.m.

...'-r .L - 

' at Carnegie Music Hall when the musi-
cians take part in what amounts_to a _

world class heavyweight jam session.

Looking over the line-ups of the past,
one quickly realizes that this event
reads like a who's who of the leaders
and innovators in modern jazz. Nearly
every essential name in the develop-
ment of the swinging, yet progressive
post-bop sound has participated: Son-
ny Rollins, Jim Hall, Kenny Burrell,
Dexter Gordon, Ron Carter, Max
Roach, Elvin Jones, Donald Byrd,
Freddie Hubbard. 

lf “star appeal” exists in jazz music,
then 1984 was the year for it at Pitt.
Last year’s seminar featured the’ “Sax-
ophonus Colossus” himself, Sonny
Rollins. Rollins is perhaps the most im-
portant living saxophonist. He was per-
sonally responsible for creating and
popularizing the “tenor sound” that

Vonnegut explores Galapago, fin

B7George Kresak

In what has been a remarkably suc-
cessful literary career, Kurt Vonnegut
has composed many an engaging tale
of human frailty and folly. Unfortunate-
ly, Galapagos, his most recent novel,
is largely a disappointment. Cap-
tivating it is not. lll-conceived, im-

r mature and preachy it certainly is.

The story is narrated by the ghost of
Kilgore Trout’s decapitated son, Leon,
and tells of the events that have deter-
mined the evolutionary status of
mankind in the oh-so-distant future.
Global. economic ruin, the commence-
ment of devastating regional armed
conflicts and some unusual twists of
fate result in the stranding of an odd
assortment of humanity on one of the
small islands comprising the
Galapagos archipelago. When all
humanity elsewhere in the world is
decimated, it becomes incumbent
upon this small, inharmonious group

' to propagate the species.

Given such a shamelessly unoriginal
plot line, it would require all of the
varied skills derived from Vonnegut’s
experience as a “pop”' novelist to
salvage the novel and create an enter-
taining, worthwhile product. This he
has frequently accomplished in the
past. In his previous works, Vonnegut
has displayed a penchant for simple,

  
 

even cliched ideas which he infuses
with charm and value by adopting
fresh, witty approaches and
perspectives.

Sadly, this is not the case in
Galapagos. Vonnegut has gone stale,
his gimmickry is more apparent than
ever, and his ideas are as prehistoric
as the marine iguanas which inhabit
the Galapagos Islands.

Vonnegut attributes the catastrophic
events that occur in this novel to what
he refers to as man’s “big brain,”
which enables man to perform all sorts
of atrocities against his fellow. Not on-
ly does it provide mankind with the

 

A. abilit to construct weapons capable of

mind-boggling destruction, butit also

predisposes him to experience im- '

pulses toward acts of hatred,
vengeance and cruelty.

Now, Mr. Vonnegut, l’m aware of
your irrational, deep-abiding fondness
for-the uncomplicated, but this ex-
planation for mankind's flirtation with
extinction is just a tad too simple. lt’s
too simplistic even for comic effect.

Vonnegut manipulates the “big-

brain” theory to satirize the evolu-
tionary process, but it just doesn’t
work. it’s not pointed or funny; it’s
merely cute.

ds old hat  

Vonnegut doesn’t envision much
hope for mankind in the future. His is
a formula for despair. What has man
to look forward to, according to Von-_
negut? Either nuclear annihilation or
an exceedingly seal-like existence,
neither of which is particularly attrac-
tive. Has Vonnegut finally been con-
sumed by his own dark, hideous,
doom-saying cynicism? So it would
seem.

Not to be entirely negative,
Galapagos does have several points to
recommend it. The character of Cap-
tain Adolf von Kleist, sire of all future
humanity, is splendidly useless,
tragically absurd and outrageously
comical — in sum, he is a delight. And
the device call Mandarax has been im-
bued with an excruciatinglyannoying
talent for delivering just the right
literary quote for the occasion, a
characteristic that would come in par-
ticularly handy at a cocktail party or
when embellishinga term paper or
some other scholarly tract.

In all, however, the book is a dismal '

failure. Vonnegut’s energies seem on
the wane. It may be, as many critics
have been claiming, that Vonnegut is
“written out.” It is even quite possible
that he has been stricken with senility
and will be cursed with imbecility for
the remainder of his career.

But why lament? It's no big deal. He
certainly wasn't going to write
Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.

 

By Matthew Yokobosky

At Vassar, her acting coach told her
that she would never be an actress of
any importance. Today, Meryl Streep
is America’s foremost actress, winning
Academy Awards for Sophie ’s Choice
and Kramer vs. Krammer. In her latest
film, Fred Schepisi’s -Plenty, Streep
portrays Susan Traherne, a woman
who feels that she is standing on the
brink of a new and better world only to
find that her dream is at odds with that
prosperous but spiritually bankrupt

society of post-World War II England. -

In an age of plenty, Susan is hungry
for more.

Plenty’s story is about Susan, an
emotionally unstable woman who
“likes to lose control” and thrives on
the "great kindnesses” of others. As
a fighter for the French Resistance in
occupied France, she meets Lazar
(Sam Niell), a special-operations agent
who impresses Susan eternally with
his passion on a single night's liaison.
After leaving duty and returning to
England, Susan begins her turbulent
life in search of true happiness as an

unfashionably independent woman.

who depends on friends to uplift her
unfulfilled urge for unrequited
tenderness.

Tracey Ullman, better known for her
work as a comedian and singer, under-
takes the role of Susan’s roommate
and closest friend, Alice Parks. Alice’s
overwhelming joie-de-vivre as an
English bohemian makes for excep-
tional humor on every occasion. Late

« in the film at a dinner party given by

Susan and her lackadaisical husband,
Alice refers to Susan’s. incoherent
dialogue as a “psychiatric cabaret” in
her usually lower-class dialect and wit.

In addition to Ullman’s pivotal role
in the film, both Sting and Sir John
Gielgud season the story with their
own special personalities. Sting, fresh
from an unsuccessful performance in

Life and death in L.A.

By Lori Faiella

Many of life’s opposites are sepa 
ted by a thin line; concepts such as life
and death, love and hate often overlap,
making it hard to distinguish where
each ends. To Live and Die in L.A. il-
lustrates another such pair of op-
posites: the relationship that exists be-
tween the law enforcer and the
criminal. In the film, the overlap or thin
line that exists between the forces is
vividly shown.

To Live and Die in L.A. is about one
incident in the life of a secret service
agent. Gerald Petievich wrote it based

on his own personal experiences as a
U.S. Secret Service agent. The film
has a real human air; it does not ap-
pear fictitious or exaggerated as do
many high-action films. There is not a
moment when one would doubt the
reality behind the events. The events
in turn never let your eyes leave the
screen.

To Live and Die in L.A. is packed with
excitement — from scene to scene it
continues to absorb and entertain.

The plot is about the powerful con-
viction of Richard Chance, a U.S.

R Secret Service agent, and his new

partner, John Vukovich. The two work
continued on page 13

 

But despite strong performancesby
Gielgud and Ullman, both Streep and
Sting never completely reach the emo-
tional heights that their roles seem to
contain. Sting’s fleeting cameo ap-
pearance seems only to have been
created for publicity like his roles in
David Lynch’s Dune and
Ouadrophenia. His interpretation of
Mick needs more of the eccentric
qualities he delivered in Brimstone and
Treacle to complete his association
with Alice’s bohemian clique. Sting ob-
viously needs to concentrate on acting

with emotion rather than acting for per-_

sonal thrills.

ln Streep’s case, her Susan

Traherne does display a diversity of
emotions, though she never fully ex-
plodes as she had previously in The
Deer Hunter and Sophie ’s Choice. She
somehow seems to be restraining
herself from becoming believably in-
volved with the character, almost as if
she no longer had to prove herself.
Streep at this point in her career is ac-
cepting roles which do not challenge
her ability; consequently, her dynamic
range of moods and strength, like her
torment in The French Lieutenant’s
Woman, seem lost. In her choice to ex-
plore love and humor in Falling in Love
and Plenty, she is only proving that her
forte is drama, a world where serious
affairs of the broken heart result in
unrelenting emotional excess.

Plenty is not a poor film, nor is it a
four-star cinematic triumph. The film
relies on star performers for their draw-
ing power and typical attributes but_
fails to expand their screen personae.
Strong character performances by
Ullman and Gielgud capitalize on the
humorous side of Susan’s whirlwind
jaunt through life, elevating the film’s
merit to an enjoyable level.

Plenty is not an intellectual,
enlightening or consuming film, but it
does warm the chill of a rainy Sunday
afternoon with a smile, a laugh and a
few sensual love scenes.

 

  

. By G.B. Patterson

It was scary 
Well, it’s over  A week ago we all

. dressed up as our favorite ghost or

monster. Since I got a number of let-
ters about Halloween costumes, par-
ties and pranks, I thought I’d better
write something about the festivities.

Because a person's costume re-
flects his own style and personality,
people wrote me and asked if their

costume was “correct.” First of all, I .

don’t know all of you who wrote (or any
of you, for that matter), so I can't tell
you if your costume would fit your per-
sonality. Secondly, after I read some
of your proposed costume ideas, I real-
Iy had no desire to know you. Here are

 

some of the questions you wonderful
readers asked me:

Dear G.B., .

What am I going to wear for Hallo-
ween? I want to look sexy, but I want
to scare people too  '

Go as Madonna

Dear G.B., »

I'm a really tall male and have been
going to Halloween parties as
Frankenstein for years. Can you sug-
gest a costume that’d give me a little
dignity?

Go as Ted Windt

Sorry I wasn’t able to print these let-
ters last week, but hey, the newspaper

”‘Shdtvc§3§é',"1Vl8\7érﬁ‘B5r"§§"t§85

biz is ajungle, babe.  Besides, I need
the letters by Monday to go in on Fri-
day. But don’t get me wrong, I ap-
preciate the mail. It’s more than I get
from my family. I don’t think they know
I’ve left for school yet.

Farewell for now. I hope there were
no razor blades in your apples, nor
pins in your Hershey bars. Write me
about your costume. Send a picture of
you in it. Write me about a party. Write
me about your family. I don’t even care
— just write. It’s not hard; I can do it

Simple Minds can
do great things

ONCE UPON A TIME
Simple Minds
A&M

Once upon a time there was a band
of minstrels called Simple Minds. They

made shimmering and magical music .

and put out album after album, each
one better than the last. But no one
ever bought any of them. They did not
despair, however. They knew they
were a good band. The leader of this
group was Good Prince Jim. Prince
Jim said, “Someday the people in the
kingdom across the sea will see the
value in our music. We shall prevail.”

Finally Prince Jim and his band
made a record that they knew people
would like. It was called New Gold
Dream. '

“At |astl” said Prince Jim. “At last
we will be noticed!”

But alas, the group called Simple
Minds was noticed only a little. There
was a song that some people bought
that was called “Promised You a
Miracle.” But it made the band neither
rich nor famous.

“We shall try again,” said Prince
Jim. ,

Throughout the long a winter the
group toiled and labored, struggling to
create the best record they had ever
made. They enlisted the help of the
wizard Lillywhite to keep their ideas in
focus. At long last the new record was
completed. They christened it Sparkle
in the Rain.

“This one cannot fai|l” they
declared.

Take a chance
on Starpeace

STARPEACE
Yoko Ono
Polydor

Many willgroan and roll their eyes
when they hear that Yoko Ono has a
new album out. That the album is
called StarPeace and includes songs
entitled “Sky People” and “| Love You
Earth” will do little to alleviate their ir-
ritation. Even folks who have more pa-
tience with this flaky widow might be
inclined to wonder: “lf Yoko insists
upon writing songs to make herself
and others feel better, why can’t she
at least have the courtesy to let some-
one with a good voice record them?”

Because no one else sounds weird
enough to record them. Yoko is, to say
the least, eccentric, and her fragile, off-
key voice is probably the only one

suited for lyrics that sound as if they

were written while she was reading
Walt Whitman and watching “Mr.
Rogers.” in ‘‘I Love All of Me” for ex-
ample, she recites: I'm a shy girl, my
mother calls me a flatchest//’m a heavy
boy, my father calls me a fathead//’m
a small guy, my friends call me an arm-
rest//’m a big girl, my friends call me a
waterbed.

Not only does Yoko transcendentally
believe that she is all of these unfor-
tunate children but that she is a black
man who’s come to terms with his
anger as well. Bells and a do-re-me
chorus make this song a veritable
nursery rhyme. Apparently, Yoko’s
been spending too much time with

A _Sean and, hence, sounds likea Bud-

_dhist kindergarten teacher.

_ _ A -A funnyvoice, goodintentions and

And indeed it did not fail. it was
praised and admired throughout the
kingdom, and it was noticed in the
kingdom across the sea. Simple Minds

were so pleased that they travelled the‘

length and breadth of the land and
asked people what they thought of the
record. Everyone had good things to
say about it. The group, however,

became disenchanted. Prince Jim
grumbled, “The people like the album,
but I am discontent. Wizard Lillywhite
made it too noisy. We will take our time
and make a record of which we can be
proud.” _
f - No one heard from the band for
months. They were hard at work.

One day evil Prince Breakfastclub
rode into the kingdom. He came into
the village square and announced: “I
have a song that I would like Prince
Jim and his Simple Minds to perform.
l have put a spell on'it so that it will in-
stantly be a hit. it is called ‘Don’t You
[Forget About Me]’.”

The band heard rumor of this. They
did not know what to do.

‘‘Indeed, it does sound like a hit,”
said Prince Jim. “But we did not write
it. Nor is it as good as our own songs.

- We should not record it.”

But evil Prince Breakfastclub was
persuasive. The lure of riches and the
long years of not having hits had taken
their toll on the band. They decided to
record the song._

it became a big hit, as they had
known it would. Many people who had
never heard of Simple Minds before
listened to the song and liked it. It
made the group famous. But Prince

some talent for poetry are Yoko’s con-
tributions to StarPeace. A long list of
semi-famous studio muscians and
back-up vocalists (Sly Dunbar, Robbie

Shakespeare, Ravi Shankar and Nona

Hendryx) does wonders with Yoko’s
simple tunes, transforming them into
funklreggae mood pieces. Sometimes
these back-up men and women
threaten to drown out Yoko’s thin
voice; at other times they complement
it. On “Cape Clear,” a song about a

little girl losing her teddy bear, Yoko’s
breathy catches and off-beatphrasing
add a touch of forlorn theatricality to
this song’s somber dance music. On-
“Hell in Paradise” Yoko sounds
ridiculous struggling against a
pulsating wall of sound to ennunciate
words like “ ideology,” mythology,”
and “apathy.” '

In case anyone’s interested, only _

one song, “King of the Zoo,” is about
John Lennon. “Remember Raven” is
about disloyal friends and muck-raking
journalists who dared to profane his
memory. Yoko’s voice is ill-suited to
register bitterness and indignation, so

it’s a good thing that she usually-
.--,Wafbl€jS about .ra.in-,* sky and.~peace. .;;;,

 

 

Jim and his band were sick and
ashamed. -

“This is terrible,” they said. “This is
not the way to become well-known.
Everyone likes the song, but it is not
truly our music.” ’

Prince Jim said, “There is hope. We

1 will go back and make a record so

good, so pure, so powerful that people
will forget the past and hear us as we
truly are. We can do it.”

And they did. Six months later, in

Although some_ of the cuts on
StarPeace are upbeat and engaging,
too many of these serene little ditties
create an air of jaunty vapidity.

With the exception of its few serious
tracks, StarPeace reminds me of an
album I often heard as a child. Does

anyone remember a record called Free .

To Be You And Me made by Mario

Thomas and friends in 1972? It was a ,

big hit with liberal parents and elemen-
tary school teachers alike, featuring
such lyrics as Mommies are people,
people with children. Anyway, Yoko’s
album sports the same kind of reassur-
ing psychology plus an overabun-
dance of spacey idealism.

Adults quickly tire of anyone as full
of love and tranquility as oddball Yoko,
but children need that sort of thing. I
would seriously recommend that she
dedicate her next album to them.

BOSTON, MASS.
Del Fuegos
Slash

With so many bands flogging away
at a comfortable formula,’ it is exciting
to witness a band as young and
talented as Del Fuegos expanding the
boundaries of past success.

Where pounding rhythms and an en-
thusiasm that frequently threatened to
boil over were the mainstays on their
debut record, The Longest Day, the
band makes commendable use of
musical gears other than fifth this time
out. The best cuts on Boston, Mass,

are not in fact the successful rehashes ,

— of which there are a few —- but are

. instead the more sparsetunes pro- ._

November of the year 1985, they put
out their eighth and finest album. It
was called Once Upon a Time, and it
was just right. The people heard Sim-
ple Minds at their best and were glad.
It became a hit on its own terms and
cemented Simple Minds’ place as one
of the world’s great bands. .
And they lived happily ever after.

STEPHEN MORRISON

Woody Giessmann.

Giessmann and lead singer Dan
Zanes grab the forefront on a number
of songs in this new mold, most
notably the first cut. “Don’t Run Wild”
b ‘fully captures — both musically

 

 

and lyrically — Zanes’ frequent theme
of emotional longing, this time with a
barely ‘contained violence underlying
Zanes’ vocals.

‘‘I Still Want You” and “Fade To
Blue,” also on side one, show the new,
more austere approach to be more
than a passing fancy. Rather, it is the
success of these songs that exposes
cluttered numbers like “Hand in
Hand” and “Sound Of Our Town”. as
the fleshtones-style clap trap that they
are. ~

Side two offers more good news with
a mixture of the new approach (“Hold
Us Down”) fitting in easily among the
reworkings of The Longest Day’s jittery
rhythms, particularly in the raucous
howl of “lt’s Alright.” Only the albums
final song, “Coup Deville” is a useless
throwaway.

On Boston, Mass. Del Fuegos do '
what a lot of older and more successful
bands refuse to do: They adapt,
assimilate and give themselves the
liberty to miss the mark trying. While
superstardom will probably remain out
of reach, success is already theirs.

LOWDOWN
The Kane Gang
London Recordings

The Kane Gang’s unique musical
line-up features two singers, Paul
Woods and lyricist Martin Brammer,
and guitarist/bassist/keyboardist David

1 . Brewis. Backing vocalists, horn sec-

tions, a melodic solo and various per-
cussion instruments complement this
musical core and help give the band
their full, textured sound.

On Lowdown, The Kane Gang rely
heavily on Brammer and Woods’
voices. Sometimes the pair have solo
lead vocals; sometimes Woods sings
lead while Brammer ornaments the
vocal lines with his falsetto harmonies.

‘Both men slip from inspired to laid-

back singing without ever losing their
effectiveness.

All this would seem to bode well for
this British trio, but when it comes to
the songs on Lowdown,. many are
disappointing. The record kicks off with
the funky, forceful “Gun Law”. then
moves to the bluesy-inspired “Take

.This Train.” After these Robin Millar-

produced tracks, however, the record
becomes less adventurous and
exciting. .
Pete Wingfield produced the other
songs on the album, save the smokey,
band-produced “Crease In His Hat"
that closes Lowdown. It is difficult to
tell whether his bland arrangements or
a lapse in the band’s songwriting is to
blame for the failings of the remainder

' of the record. Songs like “How Much

Longer” and the U.K. hit “Closest
Thing To Heaven” sound pleasant but
dull. “Printer’s Devil,” with its tense
Fixx-like music, and the driving

. “Sma||town Creed” show more prom-

ise but don’t quite match the fervor of
the songs at the album’s beginning.

Despite these musical lapses, Bram-
mer’s lyrics usually remain interesting.
He writes about hope for justice and

  Rockin’    with

Kane Gang

 

unduly preachy. His‘ words lack the
sting and passion of the Alarm or U2’s
songs but still have impact.

The Kane Gang definitely sparks on
Lowdown. Maybe with more focused
production and a clearer musical direc-
tion in the future, they’ll truly catch fire.

Nature of
the beast

NATURE OF THE BEAST
Maureen Steele
Motown Records

Album cover: sexy brunette sprawled
atop an ominous bear rug, legs kicked
up in the air in a nonchalant crisscross.
Title: Nature of the Beast. Label: 1985
Motown. Artist: newcomer Maureen
Steele. Marketing strategy: semi-
attractive ladywho happens to sing,
slap some make-up on her ‘and make
her a star.

The consistent sprouting of female
solo artists. in the pop music field,
spearheaded by Madonna and Cyndi
Lauper, has produced dozens of new
artists, some of whom are quite ex-
citing but some who are unconditional-
ly boring. Steele falls into the latter
category. '

It could be that Steele is the victim
of pristine, unambitious arrangements
or lackluster production work from
Steve Barri and Bobby Sandstrom, but

what really pulls her underis the song-,

writing. Most of the lyrics were written
by producer Sandstrom and Michael
Price, whom Steele thanks on. the
album credits for “his extraordinary
creativeness as a lyricist.” What
creativity can be found in impossible
lines like: Do you like it when Ihurt you/
do you love me when Irun you down
and Johnny broke my heart last night/
in front of everyone?

. Throughout Nature of the Beast,
Steele's voice sounds strangely
unoriginal, like a mundane Madonna.
In fact, “Sidetracked” sounds like
Madonna who’s down with a terrible
head cold..The latter song, along with
“Save the Night for me,” prove to be
the only, uh, fairly listenable cuts on
the entire album.

The title cut, “Nature of the Beast,”
is merely a bland rip-off of Scanda|’s
“The Warrior” and about as ferocious
as a blind bassett hound. An attempt

at reviving the Motown melody, “Bad‘

Girls Do It Better,” is a disaster, more
of a Stacy Lattisaw reject than
anything else. I doubt we'll hear from
Maureen Steele ever again. Don’t buy
Nature of the Beast. Go to the zoo
instead.

Much more
madness

IN MY HEAD
Black Flag
SST Records

Pain and misery coming straight
from the gut, continual guitar educa-
tion by the Grateful Dead’s last fa_n, the
threatening pounding of a snare
drum’s nightmare and Madonna's evil
sister are all signs of the insanity!

You’ve guessed it: the deadly spray
of Black Flag is at it again with their
latest release, “In My Head. ” As in the
past, they are still attacking the police
force with Raymond Pettibon’s art-
work. Ironically, drinking and driving is
the subject of their should-be smash
“Drinking and Driving."

But don’t get Henry J. Rollings
wrong. The song isn’t against drinking
in general: “Go ahead, you can party
party down, but just make sure you

‘ don ’t fill the car full of buddies and wrap

it around a tree!” Nothing short of
brilliance by the man, the prophet, the
lizard king.

On other cuts from the nine-song LP,
Rollings experiments a bit and suc-
cessfully broadens Black Flag’s vocal
department with occasional echoing
on “You're Retired at 21  and get this
— Kira joins in with backing vocals on
“lt’s All Up to You.” These additions
make this one of their best bends in
records yet! It could even be compared
to MRN!!! ’

On a side note, Stevenson has left
the band to reform his old band, The
Descendents, and Kira has left, hook-
lrlgup with the Go-Go’s.

By Dave Zuchowski

Chuck Mangione —— musical artist,
flugelhornist, composer, band leader,
educator and producer — also
displays his considerable skill as
raconteur in an interview with
Showcase‘ magazine.

Mangione and his band will perform
with the Pittsburgh Symphony in the
Pops Series at Heinz Hall on Friday,
Nov. 15, Sunday, Nov. 17, and Mon-
day, Nov. 18. He is the winner of two
Grammies and two Gold Record

Awards, plus an Emmy Award for-

“Give It All You Got.” He has also
been quoted as saying, “My horn is
like a woman — if you don’t hug her
day and night, when it’s time to play,
nothing is going to happen.”

Showcase: I understand that you’re
from Rochester, N. Y., and your dad
was a retail grocer.

C.M.: That’s right. Both my parents
enjoyed music,-but neither of them
were performers. But as a child, Mom
and Dad gave me opportunities to hear
any music I was interested in. My
brother Gap is a keyboard player. And
I started out at the age of eight play-
ing the ivories. At 10 I switched to
trumpet.

Show: I understand your family enter-
tained a lot of musicians in your home
— Dizzy Gillespie, for one.

C.M.: That is right. Actually our
house became kind of a pitstop for
musicians who came through town. In
the early ’50s, groups would spend
maybe two weeks in town instead of
one-nighters like we do. And they knew
that our house had good home cook-
ing and a good record collection. It

'wasn’t very long before they’d come

by. We’d usually go out to catch them
playing at a Sunday matinee.

My brother and I and several other
musicians formeda group called the
Jazz Brothers. We played once in
Pittsburgh in the early days at the
Crawford Grill, and I later played there
again with Art Blakey and the Jazz
Messengers.

Show: This year the Jazz ‘Festival in
Pittsburgh was dedicated to Art Blakey.
I understand that you joined the group
after Freddie Hubbard left. How did you
manage to join the group?

C.M.: Well, actually I met Art when
I was a teenager in Rochester, and I
got to sit in with his band. He invited
me to go to New York at the time. But
.I was only 15, and I decided high
school and getting a degree was
something I’d rather pursue. Eventual-
ly when Freddy ‘ Hubbard left, Art
called Dizzy Gillespie and asked him
to recommend someone. And he rec-
ommended me. »

More life and death

together viciously to uncover a deluxe
counterfeit operation run by Eric
Masters. Chance is after Masters for
personal as well as professional
reasons: He is responsible for the

. murder of his former partner and best

friend who was ruthlessly murdered
after discovering Masters’ well-hidden
print shop.

After this, Chance vows that he will
do “whatever it takes” to get Masters,
which he proves in a countless number
of ways. In one scene he and his part-
ner go as far as committing a crime,
one instance where the overlap or thin
line is demonstrated. They intercept
$50,000 from a diamond buyer, who
turns out to be an FBI agent working
undercover. Chance and Vukovich
need $30,000 to set up a deal with
Masters, or rather to set up Masters.

There are a number of elements that
work together to help this film click.
The music, written by Wang Chung
especially for the movie, has a wise,
mysterious street sound that seems to
be a part of the Los Angeles streets,
where the movie was filmed. From
dark back alleys to eight-lane

 

Art Blakey?

C.M.: Two-and-a-half years.

Show: After that you went to the
Eastman School of Music?

C.M.: Actually I was at Eastman
before that, where I worked toward a
bachelor of music degree. But after I
left Art’s group, I went back to
Eastman to teach jazz.

Show: How did you get into switching

in’ with Chuck

Show: And how long were you with "

its brilliance and its strength in the up-
per register, whereas the flugelhorn
has a darker, more mellow sound.

If you’re a free-lance musician and
you’re a trumpet player, you carry a
flugelhorn like a tennor sax carries a
soprano these days. I think that most
people who double on the flugelhorn
find that it’s an instrument that is pret-
ty challenging. You can overblow the
instrument very easily, and a lot of peo-

from trumpet to fluge/horn?

C.M.: Well, I play strictly the
flugelhorn now. I haven’t played
trumpet for a whole lot of years. I‘ first
came into contact with the instrument
at Eastman, and those of us who were
into jazz were listening and admiring
the music of Miles Davis’ work with Gil
Evans. And there were a whole series
of great recordings they made. Miles
was playing the flugelhorn on the
recordings, and students were doing
transcriptions of them, and we got
together to perform them.

That’s when I went out and got a
flugelhorn, and I really fell in love with
the sound and the feel of the instru-
ment. Although it’s in the same key
and fingered the same as the trumpet,
the trumpet is known for its power and

 

ple fatigue very quickly on the horn.
Most trumpet players, however, don’t
get what I consider a real flugelhorn
sound because of their approach to it.

Show: I did hear you /ive-once in Las
llegas at the Aladdin Hotel, about the
time of your big hit "Feels So Good.”
Ironically enough, I had just finished
reading Oscar Lewis’ The Children of
Sanchez about a year before and was
really flabbergasted to hear that you
were doing the soundtrack to the soon-
to-be-re/eased movie version. I-waited
for the movie but never saw it playing
at any of the local theaters. Has it ever
been released?

C.M.: Well, we have one of the few
soundtrack albums to sell over.
800,000 copies without a movie. I think
it kind of died in the editing room. From

   

 

  

highways to high-class boulevards, the
scenery in this film adds to the excite-
ment of the actions. The film also takes
the audience into private art galleries,
a prison and some sleezy street bars
such as the Dog Run.

To Live and Die in L.A. has what is
called an ensemble cast: There are
seven leading roles altogether. These,
like the scenery and the music, work
effectively together.

William Peterson stars as Richard
Chance, the aggressive Secret Service

agent totally committed to his cause.
William Defoe is the clever
counterfeiting master of criminal art.
These two men prove to be equally in-
telligent and determined. The battle
between them -is like a well-matched
wrestling bout, the winner, if there is
a winner, can only win by a slight edge.

John Pankow stars as Chance’s
partner, Vukovich, avsquare compared
to Chance and dedicated solely to the
books. He eventually gets drawn in by

Chance’s criminalplans and non--

what I had seen 0 the five-and-a-half
hours of rough footage, I thought it had
a lot of potential.

Show: Well, Ireally thought the book I

was good and, of course, the film stars
were Anthony Quinn and Dolores del ’
Rio, two pretty good actors. So it has
never been released?

C.M.: Well, it had a very insignifi-
cant release and showed up here and
there in some out-of-the-way market
places. Someone has said that there’s
a video of the movie available, but I've
never been able to track it down.

Show: You're calling from Hartford,
Conn. where you’re playing with their
symphony now, and you ’ve played with
the Denver Orchestra this tour. I saw
your schedule of the tour, and you’re
playing 33 gigs from Sept. 11 through

. Dec. 13. Whatabout rehearsal time —

how do you plug your group into the
various symphony orchestras you per-
form with? '

C.M.:WeII, it’s always a challenge.
But the Pittsburgh Symphony is one of
the world’s great orchestras. Usually
the amount of rehearsal time you have
determines the amount of music you
perform. We will intersperse music for
my small group with music we’ll be
playing with the orchestra. We’ll be do-
ing some things from “Sanchez.” I'm
sure we’ll do “The Land of Make
Believe.” But until you really get into
rehearsals, the program remains pretty
flexible.

Show: Do you plan to do any videos?
_ C.M.: We did a video with our
Disguise album to a song called
“Diana Di.” Although the video didn’t
get a lot of exposure, it did get a cou-
ple of awards for best editing and best
direction. Video has become a
necessary part of the music industry
because there are millions of people
staring at the tube all the time.

Show: Are you much into classical
music, and if so, who is your favorite
classical composer?

C.M.: Yes, it’s the kind -of music I
enjoy. I guess my favorite composer
would be Brahams. He's one of the all-
time great melody writers.

Show: What are your plans for the ‘

future?
C.M.: Well, our touring schedule

goes up to the Christmas holidays. And ’

I'll be getting together with the record
companies to discuss plans for my
next album. l’ll also be appearing on
the Dick Clark 33rd anniversary
special with what I think is one of the
most unusual combination of musi-
cians I’ve ever seen. There’ll be
everyone from Bo Diddley, Glen
Campbell, Charlie Daniels, ‘George
Duke to Tom Scott — 26 musicians
altogether, I believe.

 

chalant attitude.

These three men are all new faces
chosen by director William Friedkin,
winner of an Academy Award for The
French Connection. His choice was
well-made — the acting is real and
raw.

Other leads in the film are Masters’
accomplice-lover Bianca Torres
(Debra Feuer). Ruth Lanier (Darlanne
Fluegel) is an ex-convict forced to be
Chance’s informer and lover to stay
out of prison. Masters’ personal staff
includes Carl Cody (John Turturio) who
gets arrested in an airport restroom
carrying the goods (the money). Bob
Grimes is Masters’ double-timing at-
torney who rats on Masters when the
law gets too close.

The cast of characters works to form
a worldly-wise movie including all
elements of drama: murder, passion,
hate and betrayal. As far as the ending
goes, it’s not what youwould expect.
Friedkin does a good job at misleading
the audience into a state of suspense.

To Live and Die in L.A. is definitely
worth seeing. It is the kind of movie
that will keep viewers biting their nails

. for the entire two hours.

Brecker, a fine young trumpeter who's

llll claim to jazz fame was his member-
a ship in the landmark fusion band, Larry
Coryel|’s Eleventh House. That band
was among the handful of bands that
, successfully combined the intensity of
W: rock with the progressive and complex
spirit of new jazz. Along with his
renowned brother Michael, who plays
tenor saxophone, they make up the
Brecker Brothers. They've recorded
several lps of funky jazz highlighted by
challenging unison melodies. Brecker
is well-known as an ace studio session 
man. Rock fans may know his playing
from Bruce Springsteen's “Meeting
Across the River,” from the Born to
Run album. He played on several
tracks on that Ip. He has a fine, pure
tone — kind of an introverted Freddie
Hubbard.

Alan Dawson will be providing the
percussion expertise at this year’s
event. Dawson is one of the jazz artists
most dedicated to passing on the art
form through education. He has taught
at Boston’s Berklee School of Music
since 1956. He is the author of a well-
known technique manual, A Manual for -5...
the Modern Drummer. Dawson has
recorded with the likes of Booker Er-
vin, Dexter Gordon and Jaki Byard. He
has worked almost exclusively in
Boston since the 1950s.

Davis, the director of Pitt’s jazz pro-
gram will, of course, be lending his
enormous talents and energy to this
event as the organizer of the whole af-
fair. He is a superb saxophonist, and
spent much of the 1960s in Paris and
Europe, where he had, and still has,
a loyal following. This past summer he
was one of the central figures of the
Paris Renunion Band, a brief col-
laborative effort by a group of
Americans who had worked as musi-
cians in Paris during the 1960s. The
group included Slide Hampton,
Johnny Griffin and Woody Shaw. I hey

Jumping and shaking in their ski caps,

hour’s worth of quirky cutups. Songs
like the derisive “Boogie With The
Bagwan” and the downright silly
“Water-ski With The Vikings” showed
the band’s songwriting potential.
However, the fat anthem “Like

lyrically underdeveloped salute to

seemed to fulfill the band’s expecta-

and shouting with the zany Spud boys

_ to analyze their songs.

The Sponges, who appeared next,
ran through a set of entrancing, well-
crafted songs, including their burning
opening number “Never-ending
Road” and hook-filled tunes like

“Security.” Singer Chris Theoret stood ‘

out with his dramatic vocal delivery.
The band closed with two songs they
just recorded as a demo for EMI,
joined onstage by Kids After Dark sax-
ophonist/percussionist Jeff Herring.
Although the lyrics of many of the
Sponges.’ songs are hardly profound,
their aggressive musical performances
more than make up for it. "
The Affordable Floors, with movies
appearing behind them and a televi-
sion screen before them, seemed the
most invested-in band of the night.
Two personnel changes/additions
have aided the band: Drummer Ken
Zenkevich laid down steady rhythms,
and Steve Morrison (whose song “We
Are Boomerang,” a combination of
’60s pop and ’80s synth sensibility,
highlighted the set) added interesting
guitar flashes when he could be heard.
Bassist Eric Reibling’s playing shone,
too, and songs like “Geneva” and
“The Linoleum Shuff|e” sounded ex-
cellent. But too often the Floors’ songs
dragged on with Harvey Calbin’s vocal
line and synthesizer parts repeating
tirelessly. The band sounded tight,
though, and drew the evening’s most
enthusiastic audience response.

l’ve had a rotten week. Rio
was a washout. It rained the
whole time. Accordingly, this in-
stallment of Singles is pretty
cranky. Why don ‘f you write a
letter and whine about how un-
fair I am? It won’t change
anything, but at least you ‘II have
amused me.

Mr. Mister: Broken Wings

I won’t even mention the fact that the
central metaphor of this song is a bla-
tant, undeniable, laughably obvious
steal from the Beatles’ classic

' “Blackbird.” I won’t even mention it.

A much more fun comment would be
to say that Mr. Mister must really have
broken wings because this song never
takes off. Or you could say that
“Broken Wings” is like a penguin: It

I has feathers, but it’s so fat and weak
I that it doesn’t fly. No, that’s pretty silly.

I guess the only thing you can really
say is simply, “Zzzzz.”

Eurythmics: There Must Be Angel
(Playing With My,Heart)

The Eurythmics are the most hyped-

cannot disguise the fact that a song is
fundamentally weak. I don’t care if

Sting: Fortress Around Your Heart

There are plenty of reasons to hate
Sting. He is an intelligent songwriter,
a good bass player, a promising actor, .
a terrific singer and is good-looking to
boot. And he’s cocky about it.

Before you start throwing darts at his
picture, however, may I remind you
that, difficult though it is to admit, peo-
ple like Sting saved rock-n-roll from the
likes of Air Supply. The Police were a
focal point of the New Wave (which I
hereby declare officially over), influenc-
ing many of the bright young bands
that you folks listen to today.

Sting is still out there redefining the
boundaries of popular culture with
well-constructed, inventive music that
is, for all its mass appeal, subversive
in its originality. He’s become an
overblown media monstrosity, true, but
he’s one of the few people deserving
of such, widespread fame.

And his newest single ain’t bad.

Mary Jane Girls: Wild and Crazy Love

Imagine my disappointment when I
found out that Steve Martin didn’t write
this. It was, however, penned by
another professional comedian, Flick
James. The Mary Jane Girls, in case
you don’t know, are James’ answer to
Vanity 6: an all-girl, all-sex dance
music ensemble who singlousy songs.
“|n My House,” their first hit, wasn’t
entirely wretched because it had sort
of an interesting melody. “Wild and
Crazy Love,” though, is bottom-of-the-

David Bo_wie/Mick Jagger: Dancin’ in
the Streets

This should have been exciting. It
has all the basic ingredients for a
showstopper: a classic song, hot state-
of-the-art production and a flrst-time-
ever duet between rock’s most
celebrated male vocalists. For some
reason, though, it doesn’t catch fire.
Maybe it’s just that the whole thing’s
too forced. You get the feeling that
everyone behind this was saying,

“This is going to be so great!” It Big A

Lips and The Gaunt One had just
bumped into each other and recorded
this spontaneously, perhaps it would
have been something significant. As it
is, it’s not great shakes.

Starship: We Built, This City

This is one of those songs that
scares you away from the radio for
months. It sort of sounds like the
theme from a Saturday morning _car-
toon show — “The Krofft Superstar
Hour” or something. If it were a parody
of rock music, it would be brilliant. Un-
fortunately,_ it’s meant to be taken
seriously. What if these geriatric hip-
pies, were your parents — Ever think
about that? What a horrifying idea

John Cougar Mellencamp: Small Town

At the risk of losing credibility, I dog-
gedly maintain that this is a terrific
song. Yes, it’s simple-minded and
derivative, but who cares? It’s as solid
a piece of mainstream American rock
as anything since Bruce Springsteen
started waving the flag (after he
realized he’d lost his songwriting abili-
ty). At least Mellencamp knows
enough to stick to simple ideas that he
can’t screw up: I was born in a small
‘town — it’s not likely that he’s lying.
Synthetic.drums and funk bass lines
can get to be a drag. This song is

refreshing, that’s all.

Mick Jagger: Lucky In Love

To say that Mick Jagger is among
the most overexposed humans living
is a pretty major understatement.
When that many people know who you
are and what you've done in the past,
every further accomplishment must be
twice as astounding as the last to keep
people interested. This is a shame, but
it is a fact. Nothing on Jagger’s solo
lp — certainly not “Lucky In Love” -
is in any way astounding. it’s more pop
— safe, tried-and-true and, beneath all
the crashing and yelling, tired. I hate
to say that you can’t rock-n-roll past 40,
but so far there is no evidence to the

contrary. Hang it up, Mick. _

“Cloud 9”

By Leslie Bennett

What begins as a parody of Victorian
pomp quickly becomes a parade of
perversions in Caryl Churchill’s Cloud

.9, the opening production for Pitt's

Mainstage theatre season. The British
playwright may have found a hit for her
home audiences, and even New York

apparently responded well when the '

play premiered in 1981. But for-all its
shock value and insistence, Cloud 9
only makes it to Cloud Eight here.

The play, directed by W. Stephen
Coleman, may very well be “un-
suitable for those under 17,” as the
program so boldly suggests. But those
“explicit situations” are, in fact, only
the sort of camp you’d expect from
Benny Hill. The serious stuff — the
subject and theme, that is -+ is mean-
while so explicit, so overused and
oversatirized that it may be unsuitable
for anyone over 17.

After all, cultural duty vs. sexual
freedom is hardly a new idea to
anyone. Ever since Hedda Gabler,
we’ve seen ambiguities in sexual roles
and responsibilities. Making fun of
repression is getting tiresome as well,
especially with so many recent films:
VictorNictoria, Tootsie, Mr. Mom.

Cloud 9, and its first act in particular,
merely exhausts the subject by taking
it to its extreme on every level. The
play, opens in Victorian colonial Africa
with a lot of British flag-waving and
God-Save-the-Queen sort of
melodrama. Right off, it’s clear that
things aren't in order when the prim
and proper wife Betty is played by a
man (James Bond), and her schoolboy
son is played by a woman (Erica
Magnus).

Things really get dizzying when a
robust explorer named Harry Bagler
(Richard Ewing) comes to visit and
subsequently seduces the wife, the
son and the servant, all before marry-
ing the governess (Vikki Herd) who’s
a lesbian.

There’s apparently no limit to the ex-
cesses in this first act as husband
Clive (Dennis Kennedy) and widowed
neighbor Mrs. Saunders reach a fully-
clothed orgasm —- all while maintain-
ing the proper stiff upper lip.

Yes, Cloud 9 has its outrageous
moments, but these sneering ‘role
reversals don’t leave much to look for-
ward to in Act Two. Most likely as an
attempt to hold our dying interest,
Churchill confuses the sexual identities
even more by interchanging the actors’
and actresses’ parts and placing the
play in contemporary.London. The fact
that the characters have only aged 25
years isn’t quite immaterial — it points
out the deep-rooted effects of cultural
oppression if ‘nothing else.

ovations everywhere they performed
and recorded a two-record set as a
document oftheir tour. Davis’ sax-
ophone technique is simply amazing.
He can play at blinding speeds with
precise accuracy and always has a
sure, strong tone.

For those students still interested in
hearing more jazz, this writer suggests
WDUQ’s “Jazz Now,” which broad-
casts seven nights a week from 9 p.m.
to 1 a.m. “Jazz Now” is the most pro-
fessional, consistent (albeit not very
exploratory) show of its kind in Pitts-
burgh. WDUQ can be found at 90.5 on
the FM dial. For more in-depth jazz
programming, i suggest Pittsburgh’s
listener-supported community station

~ WYEP 91.3 FM. On that station, the

listener can be introduced to a vast
wealth of jazz, from swing to bop, free
jazz to earth jazz. 1.

reaches hei

If there are any touching moments
in the play, they are here in Act Two,
although it takes a while to get past the
complicated exposition. Betty clearly
emerges as the heroine now as she
seeks out the validity of the human
relationships around her — which
cover the spectrum of heterosexual
adultery right through bisexual incest.
And when ghosts from the first act ap-
pear, the play’s confrontations finally A
arrive at a focal point of significance.

It’s then that one comes to the un-
fortunate realization that Cloud 9 didn’t
necessarily have to be anything more
than a bombastic spoof, and that the
substance it had to offer got lost in too
much silly music and overly affected
British accents. If the emotional reali-
ty of individual characters is the
underlying subject of the play, it hits
just as close to home in the United
States as anywhere.

Zuckerman highlights the classical weekend

By David Zuchowsky

Pittsburgh’s classical music lovers
have another week of outstanding
events in store. First on the agenda is
world-renowned violinist Pinchus
Zukerman, whose recital is scheduled
for Wednesday, Nov.13, at 8 p.m. at
the Morris Kaufman Auditorium, 315 S.
Bellefield Ave. For ticket information
call the Y Music Society at 521-8010.

Zukerman, along with com-
poser/pianist Marc Neikrug, will per-
form Mozart’s Sonata in G Major, a
Partita by contemporary Polish com-
poser Witold Lutoslawsky, Beetho-
ven’s Sonata in A Major and Richard
Strauss’ Sonata in E F/at. '

Heralded as one of the few living vir-
tuoso violinists and praised as one of
the greatest viola players of all time,
Zukerman remains one of the great
classical soloists. in addition to playing
numerous international recitals, he
continues as music director of the St.
Paul Chamber Orchestra. His ex-
haustive credentials merited him a
medal presented by President Reagan
honoring him as a leader in the arts.

Neikrug has attained international
renown as a composer and pianist.
Among the musicians who have com-
missioned and performed his works
are Jaime Laredo, Misha Dichter,
Shlomo Mintz, Walter Trampler, Zuker-

and, by the time it reached New York
a year later, had already achieved in-
ternational success. This production
by the Pittsburgh Opera will be its 12th
staging — the fourth most-performed
work in the history of the Pittsburgh
Opera, surpassed in number of perfor-
mances only by Carmen, La Boheme
and La Traviata.

Zschau, an American soprano, con-
tinually adds to her already con-
siderable reputation as one of today’s
great singing actresses. She first ap-
peared with the Pittsburgh Opera in
1980 as Leonora in II Trovatore.

Finnish tenor Peter Lindroos will
make his Pittsburgh debut in the role
of Cavaradossi, Tosca’s lover. Bass-
baritone Robert Hale will sing the role
of the corrupt police chief, Baron Scar-
pia. Gigi Denda, who made her Pitts-
burgh directing debut last season in
Manon, will stage the opera. Her
credits extend to the opera houses of
Hamburg, Berlin, Sydney, Buenos
Aires and San Diego as well as the
Spoleto Festival and the New York City
Opera.

The opera will be sung in Italian with
projected English translations above
the stage. Tosca will be repeated at
Heinz Hall on Saturday, Nov. 16 at 8
p.m. and on Tuesday, Nov. 19at 7
p.m. Tickets may be purchased at the
Heinz Hall Box Office, Kaufmann’s,
Gimbels and at TlX at Oliver Plaza. For
further information call 392-4900.

Crucial game
Panthers

stop Paul

 

look to
Palmer,

avenge last year

Paul Palmer is his name, football~is
his game, and rushing is his claim to
fame. Palmer is Temple University’s
junior running back. He spearheads the
Owl offensive attack, and will test the
Pitt defense this weekend.

“It is going to be a big challenge for
the defense this week,” said Pitt head
coach Foge Fazio. “He is the No. 2
running back in the entire country.”

Statistically and talent-wise, Fazio
may be correct. Palmer is currently
second in the nation in rushing, behind
Auburn’s Bo Jackson with a 168.4
yards-per-game average. He is the top
back in the East, the only one ahead
of Pitt’s Charles Gladman.

The last thing Pitt needs is to face a
tough running attack. After emerging

‘as one of the nation’s best rushing

defenses, Pitt fell into a slump. Right
now‘, the defense has allowed an op-
posing running back to rush for over
100 yards two weeks in a row. Perhaps
the remedy for this slump would be an
opponent that does .not have an over-
powering running game. Palmer and
Temple do not ﬁt that description. Still,
Fazio remains optimistic.

“The big thing that happened in the
past few weeks, is that the defense was
trying to make the big play, like strip-
ping the ball, because of our lack of of-
fense, ’ ’ Fazio explained. “I thought the
defense played very well for three
quarters of the last two games — they

just had things stacked against them.”
He added, “They felt the pressure, and
they tried to gamble.”

Speaking of gambling, in the pre-
season, Temple head coach Bruce
Arians was willing to bet the house that
his Owls‘ would go undefeated. Things
did not work out as planned, however.
The Owls are 4-5. Arians does not hide
his feelings about this season.

‘ ‘Right now, I am very disappointed
with our record,” Arians said. “We
have had a chance to win every game
we have been in.”

Does that sound familiar, Pitt fans?
Ironically, Arians added, “Pitt’s
nemisis has been the same as ours —
ﬁeld goal kicking.”

Last year, ﬁeld goal kicking was the
difference. Temple’s Jim Cooper
kicked a 21-yard ﬁeld goal in the clos-
ing seconds to give the Owls a 13-12
victory, and break Pitt’s 11-game win-
ning streak against‘Temple.'The effects
of that game are still being felt.

“It is safe to say that we owe them
one for last year,” Fazio said.

Arians looks at it differently.

‘ ‘Last year, going into the Pitt game
we hoped we could win,” Arians ex-
plained. “_This year, we know we are
facing a talented squad, but we beat
them last year!”

Palmer may show a move or two this
weekend, but if Pitt has any say in the
matter, it will be revenge that shows
it’s ugly head.

Pitt swimming and diving teams splash back into action

Pitt women
ready to add
another title

to dynasty

Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Webster’s Dictionary deﬁnes the
word “dynasty” as “a succession of
rulers.” An intangible noun, perhaps,
but one need not look any further than
Trees Pool to ﬁnd a classical example
of a dynasty.

The women’s swim team of the
University of Pittsburgh will open its
1985-86 season today as defending
champions of the Big East Conference.
Dynasty may seem to be a strong word,
but it is the only one that ﬁts. Just ask
any women’s swim team coach in the
conference for the names of the last
three Big East champions. Along with
a discouraged expression, you’ll
receive the answer in one word: Pitt.
Inquire about their team’s chances of
capturing the 1986 crown, and the ex-
pression deteriorates to utter despair.

Coach David Belowich’s squad is
brimming with talent, both polished
and unreﬁned. Belowich, a three-time
Big East Coach of the Year, guided last
season’s team to a clean 9-0 regular
season slate and foresees similar suc-
cess for the veteran 1985-86 unit.
Headed by two-time NCAA All-
America Susie —-Hickman, the Lady
Panthers’ roster is an aquatic catalog
of tremendous athletes. Judy
Haughton, Kathy Bates and -Tracy
Pﬁster are just a few of the individuals
who will aid in Pitt’s quest for ex-
cellence and success. As for the
freshmen, Belowich expects to collect
late-season dividends from his ﬁrst-
year swimmers.

“The freshmen are an unusual
group,’ " he remarked. “They need ex-
perience and ﬁne tuning but should be
ready to contribute heavily around
tournament time. Their contribution

. will certainly be a bonus to our team. ”

The Lady Panthers’ ﬁrst challenger

"dons the green and white of Kent State

University, a team they outpaced han-
dily in a 1984 meet. Still, Belowich
doesn’t expect this initial outing to be
a mismatch. “It’s good to open the year
against a lesser opponent, to condition
for the tougher challenges of
midseason. But by no means is Kent
State a team we will disregard,” he
said. “With the talent they have, our
girls will deﬁnitely need a solid per-
formance to win.”_ .____

strong team
returning

from 1984

By John Enright
Staff Writer

This weekend the Pitt men’s swim-
ming team (the three-time defending
Big East Champion) opens its season
with meets ‘against Kent State and
Virginia at Trees Pool.

The Panthers head into this season
with high hopes due to the abundance
of talent on the squad. The top return-
ing swimmers include Martin Durkin,
Jim Emore, Rick James, Charles
Lersch and Donald Martin.

Durkin is undefeated in distance
events and finished first in the
1,650-meter freestyle in the Big East
last season. Emore is the Panthers’
fastest butterﬂy performer, and Lersch
is the top returning freestyle swimmer.
Martin, the only senior in thegroup,

took second in three Big East events
last year and was a member of Pitt’s
winning 400- and 800-meter freestyle
relay teams.

All of these swimmers are very
talented, but the best Panther swimmer
is. junior Rick James. He was last
season’s Big East and Eastern Inter-
collegiate Outstanding Swimmer of the
Year. James won the 100- and
200-meter backstroke events and the
200-meter individual medley in the Big
East. M

The Panthers’ talent gives head
coach Fred Lewis reason to be pleased,
but he still realizes that there is another
vital element by which to measure the
team’s success. “You have to count on
your seniors to lead the way,” he said.
“The seniors have to perform well for
the team to do well.” The seniors who
will carry the load include Ed Bergan,
Rich Lush, Michael Simon and Martin.

The strength of the senior class is

-with the divers. According to Lewis,

the divers are the backbone of Pitt’s
team: “Our team’s strongest spot is in
the diving events. I really think we
should take first and second in every
dual meet this season.”

The Panthers’ top divers include
seniors Mike McCalley, Mark McCor-
mick and Todd Mulzet and junior Jack
Shuten. Mulzet (Big East Diver of the
Year in 1984 and 1985) and Shuten
placed 29th and 33rd respectively‘ at
last year’s NCAA meet. “They have
All-America potential,” said Lewis,

Armstrong

Armstrong is in a tough situation.
Having started at center the past two
seasons, Armstrong suddenly found
himself battling for playing time with
standout junior-college transfer Tico
Cooper. Armstrong, a 6-9 senior, more
than held his own while going head-to-
head against Cooper on Wednesday.
Granted, Cooper played with a bruised
tendon on his shooting hand, but Arm-
strong played his usual tormenting
defense. On offense, Armstrong looked
impressive. His shooting range hasn’t
widened at all, but he ﬂashed signs of
Patrick Ewing with strong moves to the
hoop ending with slam dunks. It seems
competition has only improved Arm-
strong. Cooper will be the team’s start-
ing center, but Armstrong will be a key
to the team if he gives Pitt 15 strong
minutes each game.

0 Most Physical — Tico Cooper

Matt Miklasevich now has someone
to rumble with in practice. This guy is

Both are big and strong. You can be

franchise. Pitt hasn’t had a player of
his caliber in years, since Billy Knight"
led Pitt to a 24-5 record in 1973-74.
Smith is by far better than Knight was.

Last season, he dominated as a

Big East Championship next

Volleyball team at Purdue

By Kelley Butt
Staff Writer

This weekend, the Lady Panthers
volleyball team rounds out the season
at the Purdue tournament. Sporting a
23-8 slate, the Lady Panthers will face
two Top 20 teams in Purdue (No.12)
and Illinois State (No.20), along with
Kentucky. '

When Purdue played Western
Michigan, they set a NCAA crowd
record of 10,600 spectators for a single
collegiate volleyball game. Coach
Shelton Collier said he believes this
will be a big help: “There is no better
time for us to go play Purdue. A repeat
of this attendance isn’t expected, but
there should be a big crowd. This fac-
tor should be a highly motivating one
for my team.”

On Friday, the Wildcats from Ken-
tucky will square off with Pitt. Tradi-
tionally the University of Kentucky is
a very strong power in the Southeastern
conference -— 'they’re one of the top
teams in that division.

“Some of my players will remember
the last time we played Kentucky,”
said Collier. “Two years ago, they
were ranked ﬁfth in the national poll.
Our team lost a hard-fought ﬁve-game
match‘ to them. It would be great for
us to come out with a win this time.”

The Lady Panthers will have the
chance to knock off highly-ranked Pur-
due on Saturday. The Boilermakers
will be the toughest ranked opponent
of the season. ‘,‘If we win the Big East

who has high hopes for them. “They
have had the national exposure, but it’s
a matter of being on top of their div-
ing the day of the meets.”

The Panthers are once again favored
in defending their Big East crown this
year, but they will be challenged by a
strong Villanova squad. “They had a
tremendous recruiting class,” said
Lewis. “They got all the top kids out
of Philadelphia. They [Villanova] have
new pool facilities, and that should help
them.” Other than Villanova, the Pan-
thers expect no serious threat from any
of the remaining conference schools
due to a lack of depth.

This weekend the Panthers open the
season against Kent State and Virginia.
According to Lewis, Kent State should
not pose a problem for Pitt. “They
have four individuals who are really
good,” he said; “They are strong in
the 200 meter freestyle and the distance
freestyle, but overall they don’t have
any depth.”

On the other hand, the University of
Virginia could pose problems for the
Panthers. “They are strong all the way
down the line,” Lewis said. “They
recruited the No. 1 backstroker in the
nation. They have 12 really tough
freshmen, including ﬁve of the top high
school breast strokers. ”

Panther diving coach Julian Krug of-
fered similar_opinions. “If we don’t
perform well, Virginia could give us
trouble. It will be a good early season
test for us,” he said. “They have two
seasoned divers in Mike Wellish and
Brian Crochiere. They both were
highly recruited out of high school and
have done well in college competi-
tion.”

All of this should make for an in-
teresting weekend at Trees Pool. The
Panthers hope to havea strong start in
a season that is ﬁlled with high expec-
tations. Lewis talked about one of the
team’s goals: “We want to go to the
Eastern Seaboard Championships
(March 5-8 at Harvard) and perform
well. The added competition should
bring out better times in our swim-
mers.”

title, and if we get to the NCAA,'this
is the kind of caliber we will have to
match,” Collier stated.

The team from Illinois State Univer-
sity defeated Pitt earlier in the season
when the Lady Panthers were young
and developing. ISU has improved a
great deal, but so has Pitt. The Lady
Panthers will have the added challenge
of displaying their improved game.
This will be Pitt’s last chance to im-
prove as they begin to prepare for the
Big East tournament.

Pitt deﬁnitely has the ability to pull
off several upsets. The Lady Panthers
will be playing head—to-head volleyball
with nationally established teams,
which will prove to be their greatest
test.

At the beginning of the season, Pitt
was No. 18 nationally. They lost

several matches to unseeded teams and
were bumped from the national
limelight. Collier plans to redeem the
Lady Panthers at the expense of a
nationally-ranked team. They will be
relying heavily on Lisa Stewart as their
primary spiker, as well as captain Judy
Young, who has -started to play
signiﬁcantly better. “Judy is beginning
to put it all together now,” Collier
noted. “This is her last year in a Pan-
ther uniform, and she needs to be
ﬂawless for us to be a great team.”

The remainder of the roster will need
to raise to the level of performance this
tournament demands, a level the Lady
Panthers are more than capable of play-
ing. A good performance at Purdue
should have a carry-over factor for both
the Big East championship and the
NCAA tournament.

 I See it

Dream Team: An unbeat

One of my favorite leisure time ac-
tivities is reading baseball history.
When I ﬁrst learned how to read, I
practiced my new-found skill on
numerous “how-to” baseball books
because, at that time, I had decided that
I was going to be a major-league
player. After about two or three years,
all of those baseball history books on
the library shelf next to the how-to
books began to get the best of my
curiosity. I was hooked.

By the time I was 12, I already knew
more baseball lore than most people
twice my age. When the other kids in
the neighborhood were running around
pretending to betheir favorite baseball
players, like Hank Aaron, Carl
Yastremski and’ Catﬁsh Hunter, I
would go around claiming to be Christy
Mathewson or Rogers Hornsby. They
thought that I was crazy.

trageieisiiii    ‘ -

As you can probably guess, I have
my own idea as to who are the greatest
players of all time. This is the most
popular aspect of baseball that fanatics
like to discuss. It doesn’t matter if
you’re right or wrong. It doesn’t mat-
ter how much you actually know. The
ﬁm is in the arguing. Anyhow, if I were
permitted to pick my all-time team to
play against any team that you could
come up with, this would be.it:

I would start by naming John “Lit-
tle Napoleon” McGraw as my
manager. His resume is an owner’s
delight. He originated the pinch-hitter
and the relief pitcher. In 31 years as
a manager, he ﬁnished first 10 times
and second 11 times. He is considered
to be the ultimate developer of talent.
He has sent more players to the Hall
of Fame than any manager in history.
But more importantly, he is the only

manager who could possibly control
the numerous and enormous egos that
this team of greats would have.

I would begin my pitching rotation
with McGraw’s ace, ‘Christy
Mathewson. I’ve always hated walks,
and I don’t think that Mathewson ever
knew what they were. A man who was
very familiar with the strikeout was
Walter “Big Train” Johnson. Con-
sidering that many older fans say that
Johnson threw harder than Nolan
Ryan, it’s not hard to understand my
interest in him.‘

Every team needs a southpaw, and
mine would be the greatest of all, Lef-
ty Grove. I’ve always believed in a
four-man rotation. Considering these
ﬁrst three pitchers, I think that I could
gamble on the fourth man. I know it’s
early, but I’d take that gamble on
Dwight Gooden. He has been absolute-
ly phenomenal in his ﬁrst two seasons.
He has all of the physical skills
necessary to be a great pitcher. (Let’s
hope it doesn’t go to his head.) He has
a highly underrated curve ball to go
along with devastating speed. The main
reason that I am conﬁdent he is no ﬂuke
and is destined for immortality is his
overlooked excellence in regard to con-
trol. He has an uncharacteristically low
number of walks for a strikeout pitcher.

Ofcourse, no pitcher is perfect. And
on the rare occasions that my pitchers
faulted, I would have an intimidating
bullpen ready and waiting. When long
relief men come into a game, there is
usually a situation in which their team
is in danger of being blown out early.
If I were facing bases loaded with
nobody out, there are two men that I
wouldhave ready to come in and strike
out the side. Their names are Bob Gib-
son and Sandy Koufax. They could also

serve as spotstarters any time we ran "

into doubleheaders or injuries.

As far as “the stopper” goes, I
would be untouchable. If you are trail-
ing against my team in the eighth,
you’ve lost. Imagine a trio of Elroy
Face, Joe Page and Hoyt Wilhelm.

Of course, I would need a line-up

ItItItl>ItII>ItItItIl>ItIttItI1>It»xttItIl>¥l»Il>II>Il>Il>l>It>ItItItII>II>It»ItItII>Il>It!6ItItItItItItIt!l>It

7 ’—I?h'e Pitt‘-Ne*Ws;"NovetTil5e1’58, ‘I985

that could score a few runs for this
legendary staff. This line-up would
probably score a few runs each inning:

1) Ty Cobb — LF

2) Pete Rose — 3B

3) Rogers Hornsby — 2B

4) Babe Ruth — RF

5) Lou Gehrig — IB

6) Willie Mays — CF

7) Honus Wagner — SS

8) Bill Dickey —— C

Think about it. How would this line-
up do? Cobb would single and steal
second. Rose would single him home;
my team’s already leading 1-0. Who
else has a line-up with 8,000-plus hits
between his ﬁrst two hitters? After
another single by Homsby, Ruth would
put the game out of reach with a home
run. (N0body’s going to score four
runs off my staff.) Lou Gehrig and
Willie Mays (Oh, that catch!) would
probably just start problems for the op-
position all over again. And is there
anything that Honus Wagner can’t do?
The only reason that Bill Dickey would
be batting eighth is that somebody has
to. I could go on and on and on and
on and  you get the idea. It’s mind-
boggling to think about what would
have happened if all that best players
at one time just happemed to land on
the same team. Not even “Murderers’
Row” could touch this team.

In order to be nice to the fans, I
would make the following changes dur-
ing the game. In providing demonstra-
tions of defensive beauty, Carl
Yastremski and Roberto Clemente
would replace Cobb and Ruth in the
seventh inning and delight the fans with
their prowess. At some point in the

, game, I would pinch-hit Jackie Robin-

son and turn him loose on the base
paths. I love to see a man steal home,
but unfortunately, it doesn’t happen
often enough. Robinson could also
serve as my utility man. Almost cer-
tainly,’he would see action in every
game. He has too much talent to keep
him on the bench.

If the situation arose, my pinch-
hitters would be Ed Delahanty, Ted

able combination of old and new faces?

Williams, Mickey Mantle and Jimmy
Foxx. Delahanty was the power hitter
of the 19th century. He was blasting
tape-measure home runs when the ball
resembled a pillow compared to to-
day’s ball. Williams. Mantle. Foxx.
(Chuckle, chuckle.) Excuse me for
laughing, but imagine a bench with
more home runs than the average team.

My 25th man would be Manny
Sanguillen. I know there have been
other catchers who’ve been better, but
with the rest of my team, it wouldn’t
matter. I could take Bob Uecker — but
I’d take Sanguillen because he is a
classy man who would make the team
more fun to be around. Besides, he
does have that shotgun arm.

To top this all off, I would hire Bob
Prince to do the play-by-play and Elvis
to sing the national anthem.

By now, you’re probably wondering
what I ’m doing writing a column about
baseball in November. Well, it’s just
my way of going through withdrawal
from the season being over. It’s ﬁve
months to Opening Day.

I hope I can make it!
