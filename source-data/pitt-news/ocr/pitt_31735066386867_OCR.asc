Controversial author and historian
Yosef A. A. Ben—jochannan spoke last
night about perceptions commonly held
by Western society which do not recog-
nize the contributions of Africans to civi-
lization.

“The reason [African-Americansl are
condemned by [Western society] these
days is that we no longer believe the lies ,
we were told as students,” Ben- 
Jochannan said.

In his lecture sponsored by the Black
Action Society last night, Ben-Jochannan
said there is various documented evi-
dence of activities in Africa being commit- ’_

' ted before the same acts were repeated 
and given credit in Europe and Asia. His
lecture, “Africa: Mother of Western
Civilization”, is the second in a weekly
series held by the BAS in celebration of
Black History Month.

“We have to go back to the Nile,” Ben-
Jochannan said. “It is here that the
Africans set up a school system. What the
Greeks called a ‘mystery system.’ It was a
mystery to them. It was not a mystery to
the Africans.”

According to Ben—]ochannan, Greeks
first witnessed mathematics, writing and
building on the banks of the Nile.

Ben—Jochannan has written Africa.-
Motber of “Western Civilization, ” African
Origins of the Major, Black Man of the
Nile and several other books. He said he
is the son of an Egyptian and Hebrew of
Puerto Rican extraction, but emphasized
the significance of nationality over reli-

SGB finds student rep for search committee

By Stephen Kozarovich
Asst. News Editor

Pitt’s Student Government Board announced its appointment of a
new student representative to the provost search committee at last
night’s meeting.

After a short deliberation, Pitt junior Heather Heinrichs was cho-
sen to fill the position vacated by former SGB President Jacob
Brody, who resigned the position after taking a full—time job.

“I’m extremely happy with the decision,” Heinrichs said. “I’m
very ﬂattered that they chose me.”

Heinrichs is working toward a self—designed pre-medical major.
She is currently a member of the Golden Key and Phi Eta Sigma
honor societies.

She will also take over as president of the Blue and Gold Society

at the end of this semester and serve on the Alumni Association
Board of Directors.

Heinrichs said she decided to apply for the position after seeing
an advertisement to do so in The Pitt News.

“I thought it was very important to get student input in a decision
like this,” Heinrichs said.

Heinrichs has also served on the SGB Elections Committee for
two years.

“Heather and I are the only two students on the Board of
Directors of the Alumni Association,” SGB President Ross Pasquale
said, “and having viewed her in that capacity, I feel very comfort-
able that she is able to interact well with administrators.”

According to SGB, Heinrichs time availability, her commitment to
campus involvement and experience in dealing with Pitt’s adminis-
tration inﬂuenced the board's decision.

IFC schedules dates for fall rush in anticipation

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

Though Pitt’s Inter-Fraternity
Council just recently closed the
final chapter on its spring rush,
plans have already begun for
next fall’s recruitment schedule.

The IFC voted last night on its
rush dates for the Fall 1994 term,
which will be held Sept. 7-15.

The week of Sept. 14-22 was
also discussed as a possible
recruitment period, but the dates

coincided with the sorority
rush’s proposed schedule of
Sept. 16-25.

IFC President Brian Rifkin said
the schedule should benefit fra-
ternities who hold rush func-
tions with sororities, since it is
unlikely sororities would attend
fraternity events during their
own rush. “I think the big ques-
tion is whether we want to
[invite] sororities during rush or
do we want to have rush, and
then not have sororities until

later,” Rifkin said.

The IFC will probably not
have to face the sub—zero tem-
peratures and snowfall this fall
that occurred during its spring
rush Jan. 12-20. Due in part to a
reduced turnout at mid—January’s
rush events, the IFC sponsored a
second spring rush Feb. 7-10.

According to IFC Vice
President for Recruitment Andy
Demming, eight students took
advantage of last week’s “second
chance” recruitment period.

“It wasn’t supposed to be a
rush to get large numbers,”
Demming said. “There were just
a couple of houses that needed
a couple more guys to keep
their numbers up. It worked
good for the houses that needed
it.”

This spring’s rush, including
last week’s extension, netted a
total of 106 students. The num-
bers mark a decrease from the
156 students who joined the
Greek system in spring of 1995.

Former
student
arrested
in David
Lawrence

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

A former Pitt
was arrested Monday night
in David Lawrence Hall
after threatening to shoot a stu-
dent during a fight in the
Towers Lobby early Saturday
morning.

According to Pitt Assistant
Director of Public Safety Gary
Moses, the altercation
happened after an earlier
fight in the \‘</illiam Pitt Union
during the Alpha Phi Alpha
fraternity social. Moses said
that during the social, 10 to
20 people began fighting in
the \Y/PU Assembly Room,
causing the event to close
early.

“At 1:42 a.m. on Feb. 12. fol-
lowing the dance in the Union,
an altercation between two
individuals began," Moses said.
“One individual pulled out a
weapon and threatened to
shoot the [other] individual, and
everyone fled."

Moses said the actor was
identified Saturday as Clint
\‘(/illiams, 20, of Dawson Street.
An arrest warrant was issued
Monday, and Williams was
arrested Monday evening as he
tried to enter a movie in David
Lawrence Hall.

Campus police. searched

Williams and found a .22-cal—.

iber automatic pistol he was
carrying. Williams was placed
under arrest and was charged
with aggravated assault, reck-
less endangerment, violation of
the uniform firearms act and
making a terroristic threat.
Williams was charged with an
additional firearms violation at
the time of his arrest, according
to Moses.

Demming said the snow and
cold weather which coincidec
with January’s rush week may
have affected the turnout, but he
said this year’s overall numbers
were down from last year.

According to Demming,
a ' stronger advertising cam-
paign will highlight next
fall’s week of recruitment.
“We’re going to have all kinds

People over 60 return to school tbrougb Pitt

By Jonathan Kersting
For The Pitt News

Senior citizens have the
opportunity to learn a variety of
subjects from the arts to the sci-
ences.

Pitt’s Over Sixty Program
allows senior citizens to attend
class on an audit basis so they
can actively participate in class
without receiving a grade.

Jan White, director of the
Over Sixty Program, said the
program has been in operation
for the past 12 years. White
reserves four seats per class in
various classes in the College of
General Studies for the program

members. The cost for each
class is $15.

This past fall term had the
largest attendance ever with 560
students, White said. This terrn’s
attendance has dropped slightly
to 517 students.

“What a great thing, to learn
something I like,” said Gerry
Hart.

Hart graduated from West
Point Military Academy and
played professional football for
the 1953 Detroit Lions. He is
now retired, after 31 years of
service at J&L Steel, and is
attending a French 11 class, his
first college class in over 40
years.

He got the ‘idea to at-
tend classes here at Pitt from
a friend of his who also at-
tends classes. Students over
the age of 60 generally register
in one or two classes per
semester. They want to stay
busy, but not too busy, accord-
ing to Hart.

Attending college classes
enables many senior citizens
to study subjects that they
have always wanted to
study, but have never had the
time.

Tim Miller, a serni-retired
small business owner, said he
has been wanting to attend
some law classes for the past

couple of years, but has not yet
found the time.

Not all senior citizens are sold
on the idea of returning to
school. Harry Wilker, a 75-year-
old native Pittsburgher, said he
has “no interest in going back
to school.”

He said he has learned
enough over the years from his
business associates.

Just in case Wilker ever has a
change of heart, the more typi-
cal college-aged students seem
to welcome their elders attend-
ing class alongside them.

Benita Hunter, a science
major, said, ‘‘It‘s great that they
want to come back and learn.”

“The myth is that we talk about Judaism
as if it is a race or color,” Ben-Jochannan
said. “You don’t have a Christian race, you
don’t have a Jewish race, you don’t have a
Moslem race.”

“The issue of which religion to adhere to
is nonsense to fight about. I don’t care
about any religion, I care about my brothers
and sisters as African people.”

Ben-Jochannan also talked about the lit-
eral translation of the Bible as a hindrance
to Africans.

“We never stop to think who wrote the
story [of Adam and Eve.] Who was there?”
Ben-Jochannan said. “The Torah, or Old
Testament, is the first place Adam and Eve
are documented and we know it wasn’t
written until many years later.”

He also disputed the Bible’s claim of the
first murder and the original virgin birth.

Ben-Jochannan said these events were doc-
umented in stone in Africa several hundred
years before they supposedly happened in
Israel.

“For those of you who are Christian,
[in Africa] I will show you a recording of
an immaculate conception,” he said.
“And everybody saves their money to
travel to visit the holy lands in the Mid-
dle East, such as Bethlehem and
Mecca, when the original holy land is in
Africa.”

Ben-Jochannan said before there was a
god named Jehovah, Jesus or Allah,
“[Africanl people were already worshipping
Aten.”

The oldest records of ancient history
come from Egypt, according to Ben-
Jochannan, who said that most of those
records came from Central Africa. He also
said people don’t realize the impact of
Africa on biblical figures such as Moses.

A LECTURE BYE - T

“You see Moses as a Jew, but that is not a
nationality,” Ben-Jochannan said. “If
learned in the way of an Egyptian priest, he
learned in the way of an African priest.”

Ben-Jochannan said that Egypt, where he
currently resides, has not respected the
remains of ancient African civilization. He
said until Anwar Sadat became president of
Egypt, there were no laws against destroy-
ing the remains of African monuments
along the Nile.

“The only reason they are recognized
now is because [tourism] is 40 percent of
Egypt’s budget,” Ben-Jochannan said. “The
museums of Europe are filled with artifacts
from African history.”

He said Africans have also been disre-
spected by the university community, “who
thought black studies would be soul food
and dancing.”

“People don’t realize that Africans have
such an extensive history,” he said.

All for our children's crusade

It seems like every day a new controversy arises
surrounding the issue of individuals and their consti-
tutional rights.

Here at Pitt, as an example close to home, ques-
tions are surfacing again about possible censorship at
the Pitt Program Council art exhibition because of the
university’s refusal to accept “sexually explicit” art.

Whenever civil rights are broken and whenever
institutions try to implement moral judgements, then
individuals are often forced to do battle against pow-
erful organizations. When the victims of these prob-
lems are teenagers and children, though, then unfor-
tunately individuals’ rights can be even easier to vio-
late.

This is what happened to the six teenagers from the
New Castle Area School District who claim that they
were strip—searched by school officials at Ben
Franklin Junior High School in December, 1992. On
Monday, Maceo Hill, 17, testified in U.S. District
Court that he was forced take off his shirt and pants
and pull his underwear up to his chest so that he
could be searched for drugs, which were not found
(Pittsburgh Post-Gazette).

The school district’s attorney admits that the search-
es occurred, but he said that not all the students were
forced to remove their clothes and that they were not
exactly “strip” searches (Post-Gazette). But regardless
of the number of searches and the technicality of the
term “strip—search,” constitutional rights were still bla-
tantly violated.

A judge has determined that the searches were an
infringement of the Fourth Amendment (unlegal
search and seizure) and the 14th Amendment (due
process of the law), but the trial will decide whether
or not the school officials can be held liable for these
violations, (Post-Gazette).

All school officials have taken on the responsibility
of children while they are in school. Therefore, these
officials must be held responsible when they break
the law and ignore the rights of these students.
People under 18 are told over and over to respect
authority, but apparently the authorities need to be
told to respect the children.

Many people say that today’s youth are in desperate
need of care and education. Instead, these school
officials have shown that they don’t care about the
students’ rights, but they_have taught them ﬂagrant
disregard of the law.

The adults that were involved with the searches
should be punished. Younger individuals must fight
harder to be heard, so the courts should work harder
to ensure their rights. Punishment for those who have
broken the law is necessary to end the exploitation of
youth. .

Blacks in media not representational

A few weeks ago I wrote a
piece on why feminism has
failed women. After the col-
umn was printed, I received
many comments from people
stating that I was out line in
writing the piece. After all, I’m
not even a woman. Where do
I get off claiming that feminists
in the media fail women.

Now forget about how
warped that line of thinking is.
(one can only comment on a
group of which one is a mem-
ber?!) In all fairness, there is
another group in society that
has been dramatically failed by
its so-called spokespersons.
That group is black Americans.
(Just for the record, any of you
who might be curious  shhh
 I’m black.)

Black Americans are not
accurately represented by
those the mainstream media
often turn to for the “Black
Point Of View” — Jesse
Jackson, Ben Chavis, etc. As is
the case with feminists, these
individuals and their organiza-
tion, which claim to represent
minorities, actually represent
liberals.

In my opinion, these individ-
uals are no different than
Africans that sold other
Africans into slavery. They
preach to the black community
that they are victims and that
they can never make it in
American society. Yet, THEY
make it any American society,
by preaching that message to
other blacks.

They promote what has
been deemed by many as the
“Liberal Plantation.” The
Liberal Plantation is the mes-
sage that we, as victims, are
helpless and must rely on the
master (the government) in
order to survive.

Think about it for just a sec-
ond. The slave masters acted
very much like the liberals do
today. They weren’t harsh with
the slaves (remember how
valuable they were). They
gave them food, but just
enough to keep them alive
and strong (food stamps).

They gave them health care
(couldn’t have your slaves
dying on you). They gave
them housing, but just barely
(subsidized housing). They
broke up their families (abor-
tions and loss of the father).
They took away religion and
banned the reading of the
Bible (pull one out in a public
school and see what happens).
Most importantly, they cared
about their slaves — for as
much as they could get out of
them.

T oday’s so-called black lead-
ers beg for more liberalism,
more social programs and
more “sensitivity.” None of
those things will ever improve

I‘

.BtheB.ook

 

 

the state of inner—city blacks.

Don’t give me that, “but they
can use that to make a better
life for themselves” garbage.
That is a one-in—a-million sce-
nario. Blacks who live on the
Liberal Plantation begin to
believe the things that their
“leaders” tell them. They start
to believe it’s all the “white
man's” fault. They begin to
believe that they have no con-
trol over their own destiny.
And most frighteningly, they
begin to believe that their is
no hope —— they were simply
born the wrong color. They
become like newly-freed
slaves who stay on the planta-
tion, because they feel they
have nowhere else to go. All
the while, Jesse Jackson and
the gang are getting richer and
richer, proving their own
words wrong in the process.

These so-called leaders do
not represent the true black
community.

Blacks in the inner city want
harsher penalties for criminals.
\‘</ho wants to have to duck
bullets in order to go to the
store? They want to be inde-
pendent. Who wants to be told
where to live, when to eat and
what kind of health care to
receive? They want to earn a
living and feel good about
themselves. Who doesn’t like
feeling self-worth? They want
to live in nice two—parent
homes with morals and values.

These “voices of the black
community” tell us that isn’t
possible, but explain to me
why blacks from the West
Indies and Africa can come
here and succeed. I’ll tell you.
Because, they haven't been
brainwashed into believing it’s
impossible. They simply come
and do it. Now of course,
there’s hard work, but with
that hard work comes a feeling
of accomplishment that can’t
be achieved at the welfare
office.

More blacks need to learn
their real history as opposed to
the rewritten liberal versions
that appear on TV. How many
of you knew that blacks
owned many businesses’ prior
to the Civil War? How many of
you knew that not all blacks
came over as slaves? How
many of you know that, until
the New (raw) Deal and FDR,
most blacks were conservative,
Christian Republicans, who
had a reputation for being
hard-working?

Understand that no matter
how much liberals say they
care, or how many programs
they put into effect, racism and
poverty will never go away. It
is up to us to keep faith in our
God, to work as hard as we
can and to make no excuses.
If we do that in this land we
called America, in the words
of the old Negro spiritul, “We
SHALL overcome”.

CBS buys into Big East football coverage

Network gains rights to broadcast men's, women's hoops and exclusive rights to football

By Ryan Buncher

Asst. Sports Editor

The Big East conference, or at
least some version of it, has
found a television home for its
football, men’s basketball and
women’s basketball games on
CBS.

Pitt is one of the eight confer-
ence football schools that will
be a part of the deal which will
take effect in 1996 and last five
years.

Financial terms of the con-
tract, which gives CBS exclusive
rights to Big East regular season
home games and the right to
broadcast Big East men’s and
women’s basketball games,
were not officially
announced.

Exactly which schools will be
involved in the contract is an
issue yet to be decided, because

‘ the conference is also in the

process of a possible realign-
ment.

Big East Commissioner Mike
T ranghese said that the confer-
ence will have to deal with the
issue of expansion one way or
another, because the football-
only schools —- West Virginia,
Rutgers, Virginia Tech and

Temple ——- want to be in the
conference for basketball and
all other sports as
well.

“I don’t believe the status quo
is an option,” Tranghese said.

“I have said that on record
now for almost two
months.”

Tranghese said that the televi-
sion contract would have been

do this. CBS was providing an
opportunity to us that I could
not get anywhere else.”

Tranghese indicated that the
eight football schools, which
include Pitt, Boston College,
Miami and Syracuse along with
teams that play only football in
the Big East, would stay togeth-
er.

much easier to deal with had
the expansion question been
dealt with, but that it was not
possible.

“We were faced with a very
attractive football offer. We had
a window of opportunity and
we were going to seize that
opportunity or let it pass by,”
Tranghese said. “If we held
everything up, CBS  might
have made the decision not to

stands now, it covers those
eight schools and will stay with
them if they go out on their
own. If those schools that
don’t play Division-IA football
(Connecticut, Georgetown, St.
John’s, Providence,Villanova
and Seton Hall) stay with the
Big East, they will be
included in the CBS
deal

Tranghese said that all of the

schools involved are just now
getting to the point where each
member understands the posi-
tions of the others. He indicated
that there will be a meeting of
all of the university presidents
and athletic directors to discuss
in detail the particulars of possi-
ble expansion, but he would
not announce a time or place
for the meeting.

The Big East football schools
are already meeting this week
in Pittsburgh, and one of the
topics they are discussing is
expansion.

The Big East already has
men’s basketball games on CBS,
with football and women’s bas-
ketball being the new additions.

“Expanding that relationship
into football and. women’s bas-
ketball provides tremendous
exposure for the Big East,”
Tranghese said.

The women’s basketball cov-
erage is the biggest change. The
conference currently has a
“Game of the Week” deal on
cable with Pittsburgh’s KBL net-
work. This will be the first net-
work contract for Big East
women’s basketball.

In addition to the contract

Paul Evans deserves
better than the treatment
he’s been receiving from
the university over the
course of this basketball
season.

Evans has been hung
out to dry by Athletic
Director Oval Jaynes and
the rest of the athletic
administration at this
school.

Being a lifelong resi-
dent of the city of
Pittsburgh, I remember
the day that Pitt hired
Paul Evans.

At that time, Evans was
coming off a terrific sea-
son at Navy thanks in part
to a player named David
Robinson.

Pitt at that time had a
talented young team led

by Charles Smith,
Demetreus Gore and
Jerome Lane — all of

whom were recruited by
Evans’ predecessor, Roy
Chipman.

Evans became labeled
as the coach who would

program to the next level.
But what did that mean?

What is expected of
Evans has never been
clearly defined.

Has Evans taken Pitt to
the next level? Yes.

Before Evans came to
Pitt, the Panthers were

The two teams met earlier this season with

68-60 in an ESPN nationally-televised game

NCAA toumament.

In the ‘70s and early
‘80s, the media always
made a big deal out of the
Panthers’ trips to the big
dance because it was the
exception rather than the
rule.

At that time, Pitt played
in a bad conference, the
old Eastern Eight, which
usually only sent its con-
ference winner into the
tourney.

Even with Pitt’s
entrance into the Big East
in 1982, tournament bids
were scarce.

Lacrosse team out to recapture National Collegiate Title

Ranked third in the NCLL, Pitt lacrosse is geared to beat that dreaded sophomore jinx that has plagued many

By Adam Pincus
For The Pitt News

With their spring season just
under two weeks away, the Pitt
men’s lacrosse team is gearing
up for what they hope will be
another exciting and successful
season.

The team earned national
recognition last season by win-
ning the National Collegiate
Lacrosse League title — a very
impressive accomplishment
considering that it was Pitt’s first
year in the league. Pitt, which

plays in the Pennsylvania West
Division of the NCLL, turned a
lot of heads by starting out 10-0
against such club teams as Penn
State, Shippensburg, Juniata,
Lock Haven and Messiah
College, to name a

_ few.

With such surprise success
last year, does the team fear the
dreaded sophomore jinx? Head
coach Gary Neft thinks that they
will be solid.

“We are ranked third in the
NCLL going into the season and
the teams know about us now.

"They didn’t believe we

that never lost before, so I think
that the teams will be ready for
us this year and there will be no

"We definitely have the talent

how we play, and I expect us to

from there you never know

Co-Captain Luke Fox is

“Everything is much more

conference at that time enabled
Pitt to lure some top-notch
recruits, like Smith, Gore and
Lane.

But Pitt needed a coach with
a reputation for winning to
push its program over the top.
Evans fit the bill.

Although some of his more
talented teams have had reputa-
tions as underachievers, Evans
and his coaching methods have
raised the basketball program to
a perennial contender for post-
season tournaments.

Only once in 10 years has a

For those who think that

who’s going to replace him?

Big-name coaches will not
come running to try and be the
next Pitt head coach.

There is no basketball tradi-
tion here like there is in
Kentucky or at UCLA.

The only way Pitt could
attract such a coach would be to
throw an ungodly amount of
money someones way, and Pitt
won’t do that.

The next couple of years will
be dark times for the Pitt basket-
ball program due to a lack of
recruits and the penalties dished
out by the NCAA.

Why would any coach want
to come here?

coach, plain and simple.

For all of Evans shortcomings
—— disciplinary demeanor
towards his players, failure to
recruit a single truly great player
who has made it into the NBA
and perhaps not being the most
cordial of people to deal with
— Evans has made the Pitt pro-
gram better.

If nothing else, Evans at least
deserves not to be left hanging
in the wind as he is now. Either
give the man a new contract or
let him go. Don’t beat around
the bush and hurt your chances
with possible recruits.

The Big East as a conference
is down. Top high school play-
ers would rather go to the Big
Ten or the ACC. That’s a fact.

Pitt doesn’t need to start a
revolving door policy with
coaches like the one the foot-
ball team has had in the past.
Evans provided stability to the
program when it needed it the
most.

After all he’s done for this
program, Evans deserves to stay
on as coach.

Despite the lousy treatment
he’s received from Pitt, Evans
has publicly stated that he
would like to stay on as coach.

I can’t imagine why Evans
would even want to stay here.
There are many other schools
out there that would treat him
better than Pitt has.

with the Big East, CBS officially announced a sim-
ilar deal with the Southeastern
Conference.

“The broad scope of the proposal was very
attractive to our member institutions because it
provides multi-sport programming,” SEC
Commissioner Ray Kramer said. “This agreement
will greatly enhance the national exposure
received by the football and basketball programs
in our conference.”

“We are delighted to secure the rights to SEC I

and Big East football and re—establish the net-
work’s Saturday afternoon college football fran-
chise,” CBS Sports President Neal Pilson
said.

CBS officials denied that the network brought

William Piﬂ Union

in the SEC and Big East football games to replace
NFL rights they lost to the Fox Network. They
pointed out that network affiliates were informed
before they lost the NFL games that CBS was
interested in bringing back college
football.

The contract includes 16 football games per
year split between the SEC and Big East along
with 24 men’s basketball games per year divided
up between the two nationally-powerful confer-
ences.

The number of women’s basketball games is
unclear at this point, but it will be between 15
and 30 games total, including both conferences,
over the life of the contract.

The rights to Big East events not covered in the
contract are still open.
