The Customs Committee will at last “let down its hair.”
After a year of serious training in an endeavor to orient freshmen

Scene of the hilarity will be the Red .Tuck Shop at 11 o’clock. Al-
though program plans. are being kept secret, Sylvia Amdur, chairman
Gof the affair, conﬁdes, “The high-

light of the affair will be take-off
skits on famous women—Cleopatra,
Barbara Fritchie, Lady Macbeth,
and others.” ,

Earlier functions of the Customs
Committee, however, have a more
serious note. First is the impressive
Green Armband Ceremony when the
traditional green armband is pre-
sented _to each new student. From
that time to the date set for Cus-
tom Examinations, the students
learn the ideals and traditions of
Pitt and student and faculty lead-
ers. Having successfully passed the
exams, freshmen women are given

for green ones.

The Brunch will climax the per-.
iod of Customs "Committee super-

, vision. The organization’s only re-
maining function is to present the
merit scrolls to girls who have

_ shown true. Pitt spirit in schol-
astics and activities and have co-
operated enthusiastically with the

Committee. »

Members of the Brunch commit-
tee presenting skits are Carol Ever-

Consul Discusses

Polisln Problems

Heliodor Sztark, Polish consul at
Pittsburgh, addressed the Interna-
tional Relations club yesterday in
the Czechoslovakian room -during
the ﬁfth hour.. 1

Mr. Sztark discussed the Polish-
Russian situation and the inter-
national Polish problem. Illustrat-
ing his talk, with docu_ nts, ‘he,
spoke of the relation of oland to
the Atlantic Charter and Polish
post-war policies. General discus-
sion followed his lecture. "

This meeting was sponsored by
the recently re-organized Interna-
tional Relations club. Newly elected
officers aré Yehuda Rosenman,’ C,
president; Anita -Alman, C, pro-
gram chairman, and Penn Burke,
BA, publicity chairman.

The new oﬂicers are planning an
enlarged scope of activities because,
said Mr. Rosenman, ‘-‘The impor-
tance of discussing modern ideas
and the -modern world, so as to
reach an intelligent understanding
of them, makes the work of the
club of the highest signiﬁcance.”

‘Club meetings are held on the
second and fourth Thursdays of
each month in room 113, Cathedral,
during theﬁfth hour. At the next
meeting, “Psychology of War and
Nationalism" will be discussed by
a lecturer as yet unannounced. A
bibliographical list of material re-
lating to the subject will be made
available before the meeting.

The Graduate Record Examina-
tion, designed to measure the stud-
ent’s mastery of the general college
courses, will be given April 24 and
25. Students interested in taking
these tests should register before
the end of next week. Application
forms are available in the College
Ofﬁce, 1801 Cathedral, and should
be ﬁlled out immediately.

Completion of the tests requires
two sessions of four hours each. Ex-
cuses from any classes missed for
this purpose will be issued by Dean
Crawford. Rooms will be assigned
later. Further information about the
tests and their purpose may be ob-
tained at the College Office. This
information is available to both
students and faculty members who
are interested, whether they decide
to take the tests. or not. '

“The facilities employed provide
one of the most accurate guages of
professional aptitude ever devised,"
said Miss Rose M. Pecora, secretary
in the Department of Psychology.
Each student will receive an indi-
vidual report of his. test scoresand
information that will explain, their
meaning. Although a record of these
‘scores will be kept by the Univer-
sity, the results are regarded as
conﬁdential. Students may arrange
to have an. oflicial copy of‘ their
scores -sent directly to -‘prospective
employers, other schools,’ or to the
armed forces when enlistment ,_..is
‘impending. “These tests are regard-
ed"as highlyvalid measures of schol-
asticcompetence; therefore they ar_e_
excellent credentials with any’ ap-
plication,” added Miss Pecora. -

As part of the regular scholastic
program, advanced sophomores at‘
Pitt are to take these tests at.Uni-
lversity expense. These tests may be
taken by other students at a fee of
‘$1.50. The regular charge for the
examination is $3.00. Faculty mem-

charge. Those members-of the fac-
ulty who intend_ to take the tests
should make arrangements directly
with Dr. William R. Grove, the ex-
aminer-in-charge at Pitt, not. later
than April 8. Student registrations

Captain Briizlcer
Leaves School
For Active Duty

After ﬁve months at‘Pitt, Cap-
tain Thonrias Bricker has been
called again to active duty. While‘
here, he was connected with the
ROTC and was the commanding
officer of Company D, AST, com-
posed of former advanced ROTC
members. When these men were
"called to active duty, Captain
B_ricker’s work here was ended.

After a two weeks’ leave, he
will report to Camp Davis, South
' Carolina, for further orders.

Captain Bricker graduated from

the School of Business Administra-

his fraternity, Theta Chi, during
his junior and senior years. During
his senior year, he was president
of the Glee Club, and was a mem-
ber of -Interfraternity Council.

He was tho faculty advisor to
the Pitt‘Riﬂe\ during his recent
stay at Pitt, but was speciﬁcally
assigned here to give special in-
structions _ on anti-aircraft to
Company D. _

Capt. Bricker went on active duty
in 1939, spending one year at Fort
Monroe, Virginia. Then, after three
years on active duty with anti-air-
craft units in the Panama Canal
Zone, he was sent to school at-Camp

The plan is for a senate which<~>

will be made up of 14 student repre-
sentatives, ten tofbe elected and four
students who will be members by
virtue of other oﬂices they hold on
campus. These members _ will in-
clude the president of WSGA, the
chief ‘justice of Senior Court,’ the
presidentof Men’s Council, and one
other man elected by Men’s Coun-
cil.

Women will vote for o ly women,

divisions who are carrying a mini-
mum of 12 credits in the following
schools are eligible to vote: the Col-
lege, School of Business Adminis-
tration, School of Education, and
School of Engineering and Mines.

.. The representatives to be elected
this year were nominated by the
Women’s Presidents Council and
.the Men’s Presidents Council. These
two ‘groups _ are composed_'of the
presidents of the various activities
on campus, and the dean of men
and dean of women serve as advis-
ors. " , -

This plan for a- student senate
came from a special committee ap-

pointed by ESGC to revise student" '

government. Betty Ann Crede, C,
was chairman of this committee,
made up ofthe following members:
Sylvia Amdur, C, Abbie Steinkirch-
ner, C, Bob Campbell, E, and John
Holmes, E. Members of ESGC felt
that a more democratic form of gov-
ernment would be desirable‘ for now
and after_ the war. 2,

Proposed by-laws for the senate
and further details will be published
in the News next week so that you
can better understand it and know
how to vote.

Spring Play ‘Cast

Gene Larson, C, George Leger,
C, and Norman Weissman, C, have
won the singing leads in the Pitt
Player production, “Furlough, But
Not Furlong.” which is to go into
rehearsal next week for presenta-
tion around Spring Festival time.

“Jack,” played by George, is a
former. Pitt student, now a soldier,
home on furlough. He has six hours
to spend here and wants’ to spend
all six with “Diana,” (Gene) his
_Pitt girl friend. “Mickey," (Nor-
man Weissman), is Jack’s friend
who helps him out when circum-
stances hinder the efforts ‘to re-
unite Jack and Diana.

Thelplay is a series of adven-
tures which befall Jack before he
sees Diana. All of the skits satirize
Pitt and-its students, faculty, and
institutions. A ' A H V

DOWN THE HILL’
By DICK BARNHART

And now as a change from “Up
the Elevator”. . . . _

Did you see the bobby xincksers
among the Thetas and Delts put-
ting together paper airplanes in
the ‘red Tuck Shop this week?
Someone bought a cut-out book,
and the others couldn’t resist
helping with it.

Lois Grabe and Pat Hiles got
tired of the color, of -their hair rec-
ently. There was the little perox-
ide bottle (on the bottom shelf
where they could reach it), so now
they have two-tone hair. Probably
be blue next week. '

What would we do without these
psychotics?A _ ' _

Fellows in the service have been
coming back in_ droves to look the ,
old place over again. Three we
' noticed particularly were Bill
"Keeling, Ben. Gilpatrick, and Lee
McFadden. .

And now that Lee is home, Ruth
Crawford's black diamond has been
exchanged for a neat little sweet-
heart’s pin. A l’

/ Let’s get this straight. Just
who is luring the Fijis back with
the Phi Mu’s in the Tuck'Shop? '
Mary Todd and Woody ‘Craig’ are .

‘ As American boys press forward
to final‘ victory, the number of"
w’ounded is increasing _daily. We
on the homefront" wh6'7 have vowed

bring those ﬁghting men -through
the war must. keep that trust. We
must see that they have an adequate
supply of “-plasma, when and where
they need it, so that if it is human-

able to return home.

. - The need for blood donations is
apparent, yet we-are not forced to
giveour blood. This‘is purely volun-'
,tary.- Germany bleeds". its people and
‘those of occupied countries_. without
asking their permission. : .. _ 
We are proud of the fact that
,our University was the first place
in Pittsburgh as be visited by the
blood bank. Now that it cannot
come to us, we can go to it. This is

try.
Perhaps you’ve. been intending to

even your third but have just never
gotten around to going. "Wounded
men can’t wait until we’re ready.»._’

sets the date arldthe time.” .

Ho-hum, another rush week. Hope
you haven’t been caught in the un-
dertow of the mad scramble for the
45 freshman engineers being rushed
this week. As for the upperc-lass en-
gineers, here goes:

This has been a. great week for
cancelling debts. Doubleees Chuck
Party and Lee Shreibeis agreed
that when one of them cut a class

, this quarter,‘ he would pay the
other a dollar. (They made the bet
during the between-semester va-
cation when all engineers get.very
conscientious and resolve to re-
form). After losing $15~in the first
two weeks, Parry decided it was
more economical to call 011’ the
bet. . . . Mary Ellen Ewart still
owes the junior Chem. Es pay-

 By Bumble and Phil

'— Why should you read Citizen Tom Paine? Not because it’s good-
tl A ,. {which it is, not because it's inte1'esting—-which it is, and, certainly, not
""?because it’s a best-seller"—which it is. This book has something to say

/'

.7/v

' ‘to all of us.

    
 
 

_j , , The theme is ‘simple and straight-forward: “THESE are times
 that try men’s soul's. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot

‘A "M11, in‘ this crisis, shrink from (‘V

- the service of their country: but‘
 ’ ‘ he that stands it now deserves the
_ ’ - love and thanks of man and wo-
4,, 51,. . ‘man. Tyranny, like Hell, is not
, 3’ [easily conquered. . . .”
’ _ Does not that message have sig-
 fiiiﬁcance for us, for we too are liv-
2}} '_ ing in times that try men’s souls.
’ “ " It is not easy to evaluate Tom
' Paine_.xA friend of his, David Rit-
, ~ I tenhouse, came, very close to do-
 ping, this when he said, “The man’s
f; _ a’ devil and a genius.” .
'  f ,He --was not, a sheltered philoso-
. frpher ‘living in an ‘ivy. tower. .He
T‘ lpullecl himself out of the mud of
'bpv.'erty, dirt, disease, and crime,
‘.,1"o_se to the heights, then sankback“
V into the mire. His whole life was a
 struggle,‘ from early childhood un-
’til his death. Tom Paine was always
' ‘theirebel. “Thee! Thee, thee sinful
.‘..,ff¢levil!,‘With the brain of Gentiles
,. ‘and the speech of Gentiles, God help
-1 if-,t‘l1ee”'—-that from his father because
lyhe refused to become an apprentice
'_ stay-maker (corset maker).
  ,He ran away from home and
 _we_n1’:‘to the rat trap of London:
.  f‘where_ people lived on cheap gin,
 1‘-‘cheap sin, and cheap robbery.” _
 A 1-. Tiringyof this living death, with
"*-Behjamin Franklin-’_s -help, he
_--‘-n'c’a'me.tovthe colonies where “every
' one could earn an honest shilling.”
 Then came the Revolution, and
Common Sense was born. It was not
-written for the cynical,’ the cow-

 
  
    
  
   
  
   
  
 
 
  
   
  
   
   
  
  
  
  

common man.\‘,Duri=ng the darkest
zffdays of the war, at Valley Forge, at
‘ "Trenton, he tried to keep the spirit
, -forf, "those bleeding patriots up. “The
3 sgoﬁicers, left .him alone. He had
' i,- hardly anything to do ‘“=-with them
A _1fow,\'and they in turn realized that
‘a, dirty, unshaven English staymak-

A ‘era was one _of the few things that
é,kept' what was left of the American

cause from dissolving into thin air,”

  

~a?fdly, or the complacent, but for the

.tisin_g,

They revered Paine in defeat,
‘ignored him in victory, and re-
viled him in prosperity. When he
died, still ﬁghting for a free world,
his neighbors rejoiced and sang
as he was lowered into his grave:

“Benedict
Girt y,

Arnold and Simon

They were false to ﬂag and coun- -

try

.But compared to -Paine they

weren't bad .
He‘ played false with Washington‘
and God.” .

Honor and fame are ﬁckle things,‘

but -ideas are permanent. This
drunkard, atheist, and revolutionist
showed us the'road to freedom; and
now, perhaps, we are off the detour
and back on the main road.

Sometimes we are overset. (Hon-

been known to omit a very impor-

idea recently. (The Army immedi-

that we use abbreviated journalism
for our stories.

It’s like this:

  How We Put  
. Our Baby To Bed

you’ve wondered how the Pitt

News is put to bed (that’s high class journalism talk). You 
must have wondered. Golly, at times we’ve wondered our-in VV '
selves. Anyhow we decided to tell you (got to

I.

is why it results in at ’

Friday because that is NOT the
first day of the week (we want this
story to be unusual).

So it’s Friday. The paper goes
on the streets («after you have read
Pittpourri). _The reporters are
tired. Our work for the week is
done. We all go home and hunt
for errors so thatwe can yell at
the copy desk on Monday.

So it’s Saturday. None of us think
about the paper on Saturday (union
laws, you know).

And on the S abbath day we rest.

Monday we_ sit in the ollice and
answercomplaints from Friday’s
issue. Tuesday morning we plan
the new edition. Tuesday after-
noon we give out assignments and

 

realize that our plans must be
changed. About 3:30 we remem-
ber that our deadline is Wednes-
day so we just relax.

So it’s Wednesday. D e a d l in c
(more journalism jargon) is at 5.

Bill Veenis is mad at his report-
ers. The reporters are mad at Vee-

body. Dotty Rumbaugh won’t speak
to the editor..Everyone else shouts
at the editor. The editor counts to
ten and then shouts back (after 3

June Thompson re-writes it and ’ 
gives it to Shag who re-writes  "
and gives it to Len Matonak w-hg ‘~

And so it goes: I’ve been around. “

the oﬂice all year and that is ‘all
I’ve ever seen done. The reporters ’ “
ﬁnally get mad‘ and go home. The, _
editors have a conference and ‘de-
cide to write the stories and get

them to the printers before 8 they, 

next morning. John ﬁnally comes”.

the editor is hoarse. (IF this.  i

So it’s Thursday. At the printera T
anything is liable to happen — and ,-

always does. We all cut classes and,_ 4 

go down (how else can we be surd « —
of a by-line?) and then the reg i
work begins. We throw. in slugs,

and “Uncle” John, alias “Meal

Typewriters click.

Telephones ring.

Doors slam.

(Noisy, isn’t it?)

Bill Devlin decides to make-up
(on him it don’Vt-look good). Dot-
ty Rumbaugh is worried about
her features (conceited eh?) and
Bill Tuttle is dashing around tak-
ing pictures while the Owl pho-
tographer takes pictures of Tut-
rtle taking pictures. '

_ Then the big story breaks (ah,
yes, we know more journalism lingo)
and everyone trys to get someone
else to write it. We promise a by-line
and $1 to Henry Weinbrenner. He
starts to write the story—decided
that it would be easier to win the
quip contest (plug, plug) and quits.
