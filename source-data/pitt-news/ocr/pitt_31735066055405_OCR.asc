'5 Road Rules to invade Semester at Sea

Danielle Hodnicki
For The Pitt News

The Semester at Sea ship will be
the setting for MTV’s “Road Rules”
next season, and chances are that a
few Pitt students could make an
appearance.

The Institute for Shipboard
Education signed an agreement with
Bunim-Murray Productions, allow-
ing them to film “Road Rules” on the
spring 1999 voyage. According to
Semester at Sea’s Alumni Magazine,
Shipmates, “‘Road Rules’ provides a
unique venue for exposing MTV’s
63 million subscribers, most of
whom are pre-college and college
age, to the value of study abroad
through a program like Semester at
Sea.”

MTV sent letters encouraging
students who were scheduled to sail
on Semester at Sea to send in audi-
tion tapes for the show.

Students selected for the “Road
Rules” cast will be picked from

COURTESY SEMESTER AT SEA

Pitt students may appear on MTV’s Road Rules after the show travels with Semester at Sea during next semester's
voyage. The six finalists featured on the show will be chosen from around 150,000 applicants.

150,000 applicants, who must meet
the requirements for Semester at
Sea: They must be a full—time col-
lege students who have completed at
least one semester and have a 2.75

QPA.
The applicant pool of 150,000
will be narrowed down to 150, 1 per-
cent of the original applicants. From
there, the list will be cut to six cast

members.
One of the perks of being select-
ed for the cast is that MTV pays the

Pitt to solicit

Pitt’s The Office of Institutional
Advancement is beginning a new program
in which it will ask students and parents to
donate money to departments of the
University in honor of faculty members.

‘The plan is meant to create cohesive-
ness,” said Deanna DiGioia, director of the
program. “And coming together for the
common good.”

Donors can earmark the money to go
to any of Pitt’s academic departments or
one of the 200 student groups on campus.
All donations are tax—deductible.

The program will begin next semester

meeting Tuesday night.

Pitt Athletics Director Steve
Pederson was supposed to deliver a
speech about developments in the
Athletics Department, as well as answer
questions. Instead, Pederson’s spokes-
people informed SGB members at
approximately 2:30 p.m. Tuesday that
he could not keep his commitment.

According to SGB President
Alyson Wallach, Pederson’s representa-
tives said he had business out of town
and had originally intended to be on
campus in time for the meeting, which
started at 7 p.m. Pederson had another
appointment at 7:30 p.m., of which
Wallach said board members were
aware, so his appearance at the student
assembly meeting would have been
brief.

Wallach expressed frustration with
the cancellation.

“He really hit the wrong nerve
today,” she said before the meeting
began.

Pederson did say he was willing to
meet with students at a later date.

Student Assembly meetings are
forums in which student governance
groups and the SGB can share informa-

Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic
Association and Pitt Program Council
attended. A small audience of 14 stu—
dents gathered for the proceedings.

In Student Assembly meetings,
SGB invites a member of University
administration to speak directly to stu—
dents about campus issues and to
answer questions.

“It highlights and complements the
information student leaders are giving
in their reports,” Wallach said.

She told the assembled student
leaders about the progress SGB has
made so far this semester.

The board has helped to initiate the
first-ever advising evaluation week,
from Nov. 2-7. During this time, all
undergraduate students in all schools
will be asked to critique their advisors
by filling out a simple form requiring
two minutes of their time.

“We’ve tested it,” Wallach said of
the time requirement.

SGB member Damon Hudac has
been working on a plan to restrict the
number of University forms requiring
students to provide their Social Security

were also discussed. While a few
students liked having blocks run out
at the end of the week, a majority of
the audience agreed the plan should
contain blocks per semester, not
blocks per week.

“I feel like I’m paying more for
my meal plan than I’m actually get-
ting food—wise,” one student said,
referring to the cost of the meal plan
being higher than the number of
$4.65 blocks she receives.

Another concern involved the
lack of campus phones on Pitt’s
campus. Currently, campus phones
only exist in select areas such as the
Union, Hillman
Library and
Benedum Hall.

“ S t u d e n t

Pitt senior Ben Largey sent in a

“I haven’t heard from them, nor
do I expect to, but it was worth a try

Fellow Pitt senior Jason Nus also
sent in a tape but said he is not sure

“I don’t know if having a camera

“‘Road Rules’ gives the opportu-
nity to capture on film the kinds of
interactions students have on
Semester at Sea as they study and
travel around the world,” he said.

Watson said “Road Rules”
appearing on Semester at Sea has
been a work in progress for about
two years.

The idea originated when MTV
offered Semester at Sea as a reward
to the “Road Rules” Island Series
cast. Jonathan Murray, of Bunim-
Murray Productions, said the compa-
ny choose Semester at Sea as the
reward because he and Mary Ellis-
Bunim highly value education.

“One of the things that would be
great would be if we could encour-
age cast members to continue their
education,” Murray said. “And more
importantly, continue their experi-
ences traveling. One of the best ways
[to do“ that] was to try to make an
arrangement with Semester at Sea
and award the cast members with a
Semester at Sea. We wanted to give
them something with a lifetime of
meaning — after talking to people at
Semest_er at Sea and reading partici-
pants’ comments, it seemed like a
life—changing experience,” he said.

Another goal of filming “Road
Rules” on Semester at Sea is to
expand students’ and cast members’
horizons.

“In both cases, young people
came into it with a narrow View of
the world, with limited exposure to
other cultures,’’ Murray said. “What
‘Road Rules’ and Semester at Sea
does for them is to give them a glob-
al view of the world. It really helps
to define who they’re going to be
when they get out of college, and
what they want to do with their
lives.”

Much care is being taken to
make sure that the shooting of “Road
Rules” is minimally disruptive to the
Semester at Sea experience. MTV
will be working with a very small

crew —— a documentary-like “ﬂy-on—_

the-wall” crew, according to Murray.

Murray said he hopes to add to
the Semester at Sea experience. The
crew will offer a series of shipboard
lectures on television production,
and also attend classes and activities.

Murray said the production com-
pany is “working with some of the
sponsors to try to bring special
things to the trip. We will beable to
help underwrite the trip, and we are
also working to try to meet some of
the long-range needs of the ship —
books, computers, and AV equipment
 Programs like this are very expen-
sive.” _

“People on the ship will have the
best home movie you could ever
have,” he added.

ogy degree, will be the program’s only fac-
ulty member.

The program will allow the students to
exhibit their appreciation for the quality of
education and programs available at Pitt,
according to DiGioia.

Students gave mixed responses when
asked about participating in a program that
calls for monetary contributions in addition
to tuition.

“No way,” said Jeremy Johnson, a
senior biology major. “I don’t have enough
money to give any more. I think there are a
lot of areas where the University can spend
the money they have better, like [paying]
teachers.”

Tara McVearn, a senior architectural
studies major, agreed.

“ I don’t think students would donate,
but maybe their parents will,” she said. “I
don’t have any money, and I don’t think that
I would use it for that ifl di .”

Tim Dugas, a junior enviromnental
studies major, said he would give a dona-
tion to some professors.

“ I think professors get unnoticed, so I
would donate,” he said “But I think that it
is odd since the school has millions.”

Other schools with programs similar to
Pitt’s include Carnegie Mellon University,
the University of Rhode Island, Duke
University, the University of Arizona,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
California State University.

The major difference in these programs
is that they involve primarily seniors.

CMU has the Tartan Appreciation
Program, which allows seniors donate
money to the school ’s Annual Fund instead
of toward a senior class gift. The money is
distributed to the general scholarship fund
or the school’s enhancement fund, which
provides shuttles and tutors for undergradu-
ates.

CMU has no program in which under-
classmen can donate directly, but it‘encour—
ages participation by underclassmen in the
TAP program Each student who donates
has the option of designating an honoree.

‘This method takes pressure off the
senior class to come up with a speciﬁc gift
likea bench or plaque,” said Cathy Flyrm,
assistant director of CMU’s Annual Fund
and TAP. “By the time you are a senior, you
are very busy, so we hope that we can
involve sophomores and juniors so that
when they are seniors they can relax.”

The University of Rhode Island has the
Senior Challenge, which allows seniors to
pledge to give $150 within four years after
graduation, according to Robert Clugh,
director of the URI’s Annual Fund

For Pitt, the ﬁrst priority is getting peo-
ple involved

“Right now we are still in  recruiting
and getting the word out stage,” DiGioia
said “I e-mailed some people, and they e-
mailedrnebackthinkingitwasascam,but
Ithinkitwillbesomething specialtohave
students recognizing the faculty.”

“You can rake me over the coals in
a couple of weeks,” he said, promising
more progress by then.

Jeremy Johnson of the IFC dis-
cussed initiatives to improve Greek life.
Disturbed by bad press in recent years,
IFC and the Panhellenic Association
have created a Greek Recreation Board
that includes four or ﬁve individuals
who police Greek events for violations.

“Everybody benefits from safe
functions instead of everybody not ben-
efitting from not—safe functions,”
Johnson said.

New Greek members will also be
required to participate in “classes” to

educate them about fraternity and soror-
ity life.

Greek 101 will educate new mem-
bers about drugs and alcohol. Greek 102
will cover sexual assault issues, and
Greek 103 will be a leadership seminar.

“Just because you go Greek does
not mean that’s the only thing you can
do,” Johnson said.

Despite the fact that Pederson can-
celled his appearance and student
turnout was low, SGB member
Elizabeth Klein said the meeting served
an important purpose.

“Even if no one is in the audience, it
beneﬁts me just to hear what other
groups are doing,” she said.

Klein said she wished more stu-
dents would come because the inforrna—
tion from the meeting would also bene-
ﬁt them.

Princeton to ensure no university apparel mode in sweatshops

Dally Prlncetonlan

PRINCETON, N.J. (U-WIRE) -—
University administrators took an
initial step yesterday toward estab-
lishing a code of conduct policy that
would attempt to ensure university

establish a uniform code in which
manufacturers would have to commit
to not using sweatshop labor before
they could be licensed to produce
clothes bearing college logos.

where collective action is likely to

President for
Public Affairs
Boob Durkee said
there could be
something in
place by the end
of the calendar
year that would
apply to all Ivy
League schools.

“We’re really
pushing hard to
come up with
some kind of
league—wide ini-
tiative,” Durkee
said.

The university is also working on
a national level with the American
Collegiate Licensing Association to

T h o u g h
Durkee said the
particulars of the
policy have not
yet been worked
out, codes that
have already been
passed at universi-
ties such as Duke
and Brown will be
considered when
the university
establishes its
own standards, he
said.

The details of
the policy will
ultimately be left
up to university
president Harold Shapiro, who will
be the one to approve Princeton’s
role in any Ivy League action, and to

the U-Council,
which will be
responsible for
deciding which
other avenues the
university pur-
sues.

Students who
have been lobby-
ing for a code of
conduct policy to
be established
said Monday they
were encouraged
by the administrators’ apparent com-
mitment to such a policy. However,
they cautioned that a lot that remains
undecided.

“We’re really glad that they’re
moving ahead so quickly,” said
David Tannenbaum, a member of
Students for Progressive
Education and Action. ‘-‘But we also
hope that Princeton will be a leader
in this. We want to be the ones set-
ting the agenda and setting the bar as
high as possible so that this can be
an effective code.”

Tannenbaum ‘said he hopes the
university, even though it is acting
with other schools, will have enough
ﬂexibility to ensure it has a strong
code regardless of other schools’
decisions.

Arun Ivatury, a fellow SPEAC

 

universityiwire

member, said he, too, is pushing for
Princeton to adopt a rigid policy that
will make few concessions to the
manufacturers. “The test will be to
see how resolved the University will
be in the face of industry pressure,”
he said.

In addition to any action the uni-
versity might take, U-Store President
Jim Sykes said the co-op will be pur-
suing its own policy on sweatshop
labor. At Thursday’s U-Store Board
of Trustees meeting, Sykes will pro-
pose a code of conduct policy that

would apply to all of the companies

with which it does business, and not
just those that produce University
apparel.

“We want to have some kind of
policy that addresses all of our ven-
dors,” Sykes said.

  EDITORIAL  
A great way for Pitt to solicit
more donations

Do you feel you’re already
paying too much to go to the
University of Pittsburgh? Are the
annual costs approaching $12,000
getting you down? No need to
fret, because someone out there
feels you have the inclination to
give some more.

In a new program from the
Office of Institutional
Advancement, students and par-
ents can donate money to any one
of 200 student groups or any aca-
demic department. Of course, all
donations are tax—deductable.

While most students are cash-
strapped and can’t really afford to
donate anything, the OIA’s idea
certainly can’t do any harm. By
setting up a program in which stu-
dents and parents can send money
to any department or group they
please, donors can see that their
money goes to the place the
choose. ’

The program will be run by a
group of - student volunteers
responsible for publicizing the
program, providing pledge -cards
to designate honorees, and notify-
ing honorees. If, however, the
program decides to use telemar-
keting methods, it will be pushing
its luck.

In the age of attempting to sell
goods or solicit money over the

telephone, it would be tempting
for the OIA to start doing the
same. Nothing makes the charita-
ble spirit of a student vanish more
than-an irksome telephone request
for money, however. The most
convenient and probably most
successful way would be to solic-
it donations through mailings or
advertising in the newspaper.

This program does offer an
opportunity to give back to the
University that gives students so
much. If students feel the depart-
ment in which they have taken
their major is in need of a small
amount of money, then they could
always ask their parents to donate
money, or even donate them-
selves.

Student groups are also in
desperate need of money. Clubs at
Pitt could benefit from this sort of

such as the lacrosse and ﬁeld
hockey teams, which always have
a shortage of equipment.

Other schools such as
Carnegie Mellon University and
Duke University offer this type of
program, except theirs primarily
involve seniors. Extending it to all
undergraduates makes sense and
allows the OIA to raise more
money from a broader spectrum
of donors.

Sanctions on Iraq are genocidal

While we sit comfortably in our living
rooms, gathered around a television waiting to
watch the next “Sirnpsons” episode, ethnic
cleansing continues to kill millions of people.
“How could this be?” you ask yourself. One
word: sanctions.

Iraq was a relatively wel1—developed society
before 1991. The Middle East regarded Iraq’s
universal free health care system as a model.
Now 300 Iraqis die every day due to lack of

basic medicines and starvation. Children die-

from diseases as preventable as diarrhea because
they do not have access to clean water. They do
not even have basic painkillers such as aspirin.
Simple operations cannot be performed Since
the United Nations imposed sanctions eight
years ago, 1.5 million Iraqis have died.

The U.N. Security Council ﬁrst ordered the
trade sanctions against Iraq in 1990, a few days
after Iraq invaded Kuwait These resolutions
ordered U.N. member states to pro-
hibit all imports to Iraq, with its HEIDI
military enforcing the sanctions.
The U.N. trade sanctions against
Iraq are the most severe economic

* sanctions ever imposed on any

country in modern history. Because Iraq is so
dependant on imports such as food and medi-
cine, paid for by oil exports, the sanctions irnme—
diately threatened civilian well—being.

In April 1995, the United States developed
an “oil for food” program called Resolution 986.
Certain amounts of food and medicinal supplies
are sent to Iraq in exchange for oil, in amounts
mandated by the United Nations. The amounts
are not nearly enough. Executive Director of the

' Iraq Programme to ‘the Security Council, Benon

V. Sevan said, “The situation with the medical
sector is complex and far from satisfactory.”

He added, “Erratic arrivals of foodstuffs
have unfortunately continued, caused by late
submissions of applicants, inadequate commer-
cial and ﬁnancial communications as well as
poor performance by some suppliers in making
timely deliveries.”

Not only are U.S. supplies not enough to
keep a country of 22 million alive, Iraq is also
losing money from its loss of oil sales. “Iraq’s
economy has lost approximately $140 billion.
That means the economy lost goods, commodi-
ties, equipment and services which would have
been imported by the oil money,” said Iraqi

BROCKMYRE

 

Trade Minister Moharnmed Mehdi Saleh.
Iraqhaspleadedthatthe sanctionsbelifted,
but the United States claims that Iraq has not met
U.N. resolutions concerning weapons control.
But every time Iraq comes close to meeting the
resolutions, the United States moves the goalpost
farther away by adding new demands. Israel has
never abided by a single U.N. resolution, and the
U.N. does not impose sanctions upon them.
Control of oil is the only reason we are killing the
Iraqi people. The U.S. govemment calls the
sanctions a “humane alternative to war.”
Humane is not the word —— genocide is. The
sanctions are targeted against the lraqipeople
because they are Iraqi and for no other reason,
making the sanctions genocidal. Killing 300
people a day for eight years is ethnic cleansing.
International law acknowledges targeting
civilian life support systems as a crime against
humanity. U.N. declarations state “defense of
human rights was a collective
responsibility that grows out of
human principles and morality,
rather than political or partisan
affiliation.” Innocent people are
dying over political ~ issues.
Saddam Hussein is not the only one in Iraq.
There are shortages of everything required
to rim hospitals and clinics, includingbed cover-
ings, ambulances, reﬁigerators and sterilizing
chemicals. The U.N. Sanctions Committee lim-
its the amount of chlorine imported to Iraq
because it is considered a dual substance that can
be used to make poison. Therefore, there is no

‘ safe drinking water. There are shortages of food

as ftmdamental as artiﬁcial milk Often, there are
two or three dying children sharing hospital beds
with dirty sheets. Mothers swat ﬂies away from
their sick children’s faces. I could go on forever,
but I will stop here.

I hope to organize meetings for those inter-
ested in learning more about the sanctions in
Iraq. The U.N. Sectnity Council cancelled the
review of the sanctions scheduled for October. It
isimportantthatthoseofusconcemedforthe
lives of Iraqis put pressure on our government to
release the sanctions. I am interested in action,
whether by demonstrating, rallying, picketing or
simply educating.

How to deal with

Andrea Woessner

Columnlst

After the weekend from hell (a.k.a.
Homecoming weekend), I’m sure many
innocent young coeds like myself suf-
fered at least one vulgar attack by a
drunk. I’ve devised a method of dealing
with them that, in the spirit of kind

’ regard for my fellow female students, I’ll

pass on.

Earlier this fall, at a social function,
an enigmatic personality named
“Schlong” made a bet concerning me. I
won’t reveal Sch1ong’s actual name
because he’s still a Pitt student, but let
me tell you . . . you give this Irish lad
enough liquor, and he becomes a
machine of destruction known only as
Schlong, Creature of Id. I’ve heard sto-
ries about Schlong that would make your
hair stand on end; all conversation turns
to Schlong and his jaw—droppingly
drunken behavior. He dominates the
room with a mere belch.

So I was at the party. Schlong was at
the party. I believe I was the only female
Schlong knew at the party, and so all of
his romantic (if you can deign to call
them romantic) affections were directed
toward me (lucky, lucky me). He started
his mating rituals with some sort of
bizarre scalp massage. I was sitting in a
chair having a conversation, when out of
the blue, somebody behind me started
lifting random clumps of my hair and
drunkenly attempted to massage my
scalp. He did this twice, I believe. Later

the same evening, Schlong made a bet
for $5 that he would be able to get me
into bed by the end of the night. Five
bucks! I’m not sure what insulted me
more — the bet itself or the amount.

The rest of the evening was a sort of
competition between Schlong and his
fellow bettor. After I disposed of one, the
other moved in. But with skill and a calm
demeanor, I eluded him, too. V

So from my experience, I devised a
list of helpful tips for dealing with drunk-
en assholes at social functions:

1) Stay calm. Lust-ﬁlled drunks are

 

So for your safety, don’t yell at him. Of
course, this also depends on what kind of
mood you’re in. If you’re really feeling
ready to kick the unholy snot out of
something or somebody, then by all
means, let ‘er rip. Get mad, get in that
guy’s face, and smear his sorry ass across
the ﬂoor and mop it up with his head. If
you just want to be left alone and enjoy
your happy little stupor, then refuse ﬁrm-
ly but nicely.

2) Move around a lot. Chances are, the
drunk will want to stay in one place.
Don’t let yourself get backed into a cor-

the worst kind of all, and you don’t know
what kind of temperament they have. If
the drunk is actually sober and living up
to his reputation, you can go off on him,
should you so desire. Reason and social
barriers should prevent him from attack-
ing you, especially if there are others
present or within close range. However,
said reason doesn’t necessarily apply

student’s weekend recreational activities.

ner or stuck on a couch with the person
you want to avoid. The advantage to all
this moving: you get to socialize a lot
more, make your presence more known
and meet and talk to more people than
you would otherwise. If you do get stuck
someplace, simply excuse yourself to
reﬁll your cup or visit the bathroom,
promising to be back and telling your
pursuer to stay put. Then just don’t come
back.

drunken fools and village idiots

3) Wait it out. Provided you’re satis-
ﬁed with your buzz, ease up on your con-
sumption. You’ll have the decided
advantage; you’ll be sobering up while
he is getting even more drunk. That
means you have clearer thinking. After
all, by deﬁnition, drunks like to drink.
That means as they get frustrated by your
continued refusals and constant move-
ment, they’ll focus more and more on
their alcohol and less on you. When that
happens, it’s only a matter of time before
they pass out. You can relax on a couch,
slow down your movement, let your
defenses down a little, and even get your
buzz going again. If you’re assaulted by
another drunk, go back to the first tip.

4) If you’re being simultaneously
plagued by more than one drunk, then
your problems are only compounded.
My best advice in this situation is to sim-
ply leave the party and go elsewhere —
sneakily. You don’t want them following
you. If, however, you’re conﬁdent of
your manipulative skills, you can work
to set one against the other. Nothing
makes a party more entertaining than
some sort of drunken brawl between two
testosterone-crazed sots.

Keep in mind, there’s a little
Schlong in every male, so be careful with
whom you associate when under the
inﬂuence of our favorite drug.

Andrea Woessner agrees with Daft Punk
that you should never stick a nail in an
electric appliance, and if you do, then
you should never, ever waggle.

Columnlst

Tired of being asked for the umpteenth
time to sum up my feelings about the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, I began to think
about some word or phase that would best
describe my feelings. I gave it a lot of
thought, and then it hit me: “Fubar.” .

Not familiar with the word? In the surn-
mer ﬁlm “Saving Private Ryan,” a group of
soldiers who participated in the D-Day inva-
sion are charged with the mission of bringing
home a single soldier who has lost his three
brothers. The soldiers had a word they used
to describe situations that failed to make any
sense to them, such as their mission: Fubar,
an acronym for the phrase: “F—ed Up
Beyond All Recognition.” Really, it is the
perfect word to describe this mess.

A few weeks ago I wrote a column
advocating that President Clinton should
resign. It is very true that Clinton’s conduct
in this matter is inexcusable, but it is equally
clear to me that the president’s enemies have
shown themselves to be utterly obsessed
withforcinghimoutofoﬂice—nomatter
what the cost to America’s political institu-
tions. ’

The Republicans in Congress hurriedly
rushed to make the.Starr report and video-
tape of the President’s grand jury testimony
public, an extraordinary decision consider-
ing that grand jury testimony virtually
always remains secret until the grand jury
can render a judgement. The report sent to
Congress by Watergate prosecutor Leon
Jaworsld, for example, is still sealed in the
national archives 30 years after it was issued,
to protect the reputations of the innocent.
This Congress waited less than a week
before releasing a sumningly pornographic
reportfrom Starr, areportthatseemedtogo
out of its way to reveal as many ernbarrass—
ing details about the President’s sex life and
his relationships with others as it could
Indeed, the Republican attempts to give the
report and the President’s videotaped testi-
mony wide play smack of gutter politics
rather than high—minded jurisprudence.

Fubar. Deﬁnitely fubar.

Partoftheproblem,Ithink,isthatthis
Congress seemstobemadeupofalarger
number of dumb people than any Congress
before it. I was astonished to read recently
that Senate Republicans, led by
Pennsylvania’s Rick Santorum, were angry
atSerr. OrrinHatchbecauseofaconciliato-

ry statement he made about the president and
accused him of aiding and abetting “the
enemy.” As punishment, they threatened to
strip Hatch of his chaimranship of the
Judiciary Committee in the 106th Congress.
Iwouldliketotakethisopportunityto
remind people that preserving America’s
political institutions could possibly be more
important than party loyalty. Just a thought.
It would be nice to see political pit bulls
like Santorum put aside their unﬂinching
loyalty to their parties for once in their lives
and actually examine something more in
terms of “Is this good for America?” than
“W1H this help elect a Republican in 2000?”
Irrrpeachrnent of the president is the second
most momentous act Congress can perform,
after declaring a state of war. If men like
Santorum cannot grasp the far-reaching
implications of their actions, then. they don’t
belong in Congress. Fubar.
IarnalsoverydisturbedthatKenStarr
didn’t seem to mind brazenly displaying the
most graphic and most intimate details of the
president’s sex life for all of the world to see.
In fact, according to Newsweek, Starr want-

Forgive me, but the role of a prosecutor is to

whether or not oral sex is actually sex. One
German newspaper recently grew so tired of

headline: “Clinton’s Pornographic
Interrogation ——- We’ve Had Enough.” Me

Fubar.

Another part of the problem is just how
much blame there is to go around Ken Starr,
Congressional Republicans and President
Clinton himself have all exercised stunning-
ly poor judgement and have done unimagin-
able damage to political institutions. There is
no telling how much damage has been done
and how much damage rrright still be done in
the future. But this much is for certain: In the
sarrre way American politics was crippled
for years by Watergate, Americans politics
may be ineparably damaged by this debacle.
Go ahead and say it:

Fubar.

Michael Berquist is so cynical about politics
that he is more interested in what happens
this week on ER than on November 3rd.

POINT /COUNTERPOINT

Join us for the desecration!

Gerald Bergen
Columnist

There is a point in everyone’s life
at which they become world-weary.
The desire to succeed, to perform or to
just get by is superseded by the desire
to, oh, die. _

Except for the most twistedly dri-
ven of us, there are times when we all
wish to rest on our laurels, to go on
autopilot, to leave the driving to some-
one else, or in the case of this metaphor,
to beat a dead horse. How nice it would

vidual.”

No, no, no. This idea is rooted too
much in the past; too much Jim Jones

enough L. Ron Hubbard and
“Dianet:ics.”

fact that there were no federal task

matter.

Chris Griswold
Columnist

If there’s anything I’m tired of, it’s this
pro—cult rhetoric we’ve been hearing non-
stop these days.

If I have to hear once more how special
a cult makes you feel, or about the wonder-
ful gifts you get when you join, I swear I’m
going to stop wearing my “Please tell me
about your cult” T-shirt. I mean it.

It may just be my opinion-— and I may
draw ﬁre for this — but cults just aren’t for
me. Hey, I like being “part of the group” as
much as the next guy, but I think we need
to dr ' where.

 
 
  

. wer   
access to your horn‘ and
replace every piece of technology you own
with an exact reproduction —- exact except
the new stuff was made in America!

And let’s say you do go to the meetings.
They’re always ﬁlled with long-winded
speeches about the
Leader’s personal life.
And who is this
Leader guy, anyway?
He’s only some guy
named Ron. Believe
me, he doesn’t mea-
sure up to his press kit:
He canlt breathe fire,
nor can he call upon a
swarm of locusts. He
can’t even keep his
marriage together. And
you know how he’s
always saying he’s
going to blight out the
sun? Yeah, right. I’ll
believe it when I see it.

And talk about
serious! Sure these guys tell some rather
rollicking knock-knock jokes during the
Designated Time of Hilarity, but other than
those feel-good 15 minutes, these guys
have their game faces on. You make one
joke about Ron’s acne or his child-support
payments, and — bam! — you get a punch
in the nose and a night in the punishment
box. They can be such lousy bastards some-
times.

Speaking of punishment, what about

Cmus TASCHNER/STAFF ILLUSTRATOR

 

   

those beliefs of theirs? Say it with me,
folks: “Tar paper is not a natural laxative.”
And as for that whole Doomsday-
Apocalypse thing, I think they need to
update their religion a bit; June 3-6, 1989,
has come and gone,. and I’m still here. I
think I was planning my 10th birthday
party those days, actually, rather than dodg-
ing the infernal storm of burning corpses
they profess “will happen” in their holy
text, “The Mead Composition Book of
Doom.”

God, that Book is such utter crap. I’ll
admit some well—written literature exists in
those scuffed, worn pages, between ninth-

 

  

- - ed
titles such

    

certain nuances y
readily pick up on. And because the release
of Miss Manners’ book on cult etiquette has
been delayed, one can continue to ponder
which knife to use when drawing blood.
People continue to be forced to question the
choice of beverage offered. The average
person, his need for acceptance in the bal-
ance, must think, “Can I politely refuse this
Kool-Aid brand beverage, or should I gra-
ciously accept it and risk my own death?”

The worst situation you’ll probably
ﬁnd yourself in is when you’re sitting in the
“Circle of Acceptance,” meditating each
night, waiting for the “Voice of Tradition”
to ‘speak (He never does!), and the new
members begin to ritually spay and neuter
themselves. The situation must be handled
carefully; sure, non-gender society sounds
like a good idea, but you should always ask
for anesthetic first.

And when the time comes for the mass
suicide, try to be included in the first wave.
You can take your phenobarbitol first, and
be sure your purple shroud is covering you
when “The Visitors” arrive.

But it’s this kind of crap I don’t want to
have to deal with. I don’t want to shave my
head bald, I don’t want to have to chant,
“the children go first,” and, most.of all,-I
don’t want to wear the stupid Nikes.

If Chris Griswold had a cult, he would
hold an annual scavenger hunt. He oﬁers
this special tip, though: Don ‘t drink from
the “specifzl” cup.

    

Don't bench Lytle,
play for the
future

It’s time to focus on the rest of
the year.

The loss to Rutgers was awful. It
was inexcusable, and I don’t think
.there’s a person on the football team
who will argue otherwise.

But it’s over.

The Panthers need to concentrate
on the rest of the season and not on
the embarrassing loss to the Scarlet
Knights two weeks ago.

Upsets happen: Look at Virginia
Tech losing to Temple. But now the
Rutgers game is over, and no matter
what they do, the guys on the foot-
ball team can’t change what has hap-
pened. But they do havesome con-
trol over what happens next.

The Panthers should use that loss
as motivation.‘ It should light a fire
under them and juice them up for the
rest of the season.

If a loss to Rutgers doesn’t open
their eyes, nothing will.

» Pitt needs to win four of its last
five games to qualify for a postsea-
son bowl bid. While it isn’t proba-
ble, it is possible.

Just take a look at last season. As
soon as Pitt beat Miami, everyone
expected a bowl appearance; then
when the Panthers lost to weaker
Temple and Boston College teams,
no one gave them a chance.

The cynical sports fans in this
city said, “Arrghh, same
Panthers,” and “Miami was a ﬂuke.”

The nonbelievers didn’t think
Pitt had a chance in hell of winning
two of its final three games against
three ranked teams: Syracuse,
Virginia Tech and West Virginia.

But Pitt did. In fact the Panthers
were a couple of seconds away from
winning all three. And, of course,
once Pitt secured a bowl bid, all the
cynical nonbelievers jumped back on
the bandwagon and insisted they
were behind the Panthers all the
way.

Pitt finds itself in a similar situa-
tion this year. No one thinks it has a
chance. And to make things worse,
the Panthers need to win four out of
five this year, instead of three out of
four.

But the difference is that unlike
last year, the Panthers have two
mediocre teams — Boston College

Like ESPN college—footba11 ana-
lyst Mel Kiper Jr. predicting the first
134 players to be taken in the 2002
NFL draft, it is never too early to
start thinking about the postseason
in college football.

Won’t it be wonderful to know
that the top two teams- will finally
get to play each other to determine
the national champion?

On two different occasions in the
1990s two teams have shared the
honor of being No. 1. Just last year,
Michigan and Nebraska shared the
title. At the beginning of the decade,

K  

-a«».r~a-.(v..-_......-.. -nﬂr‘

“»:ut:~c*"

Georgia Tech and the University of
Washington were atop the
Associated Press and United Press
International polls, respectively.
Both years, the top two teams could
not play because the Rose Bowl had
rights to the champions of the Big
Ten and Pacific Ten conferences.

Penn State was unbeaten in 1994
but was ranked No. 2 in both polls
because Nebraska, the other unbeat-
en team that season, had a tougher
schedule. The Nittany Lions did
everything they had to and
still were not crowned
champions.

And so the NCAA
comes to the rescue.

Starting this season,
the Bowl Championship
Series will determine the
national champion by
placing the top two teams in its rat-
ings system on the field in Tempe,
Ariz., at the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl on
Jan. 4 of next year. Instead of having
two different polls, by sportswriters
across the country and selected
coaches, the NCAA will base its
decision on one system. After
numerous hours in the laboratory
crunching numbers and dissecting
the formula being used to calculate

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

the rankings, the sys-
tem revealed that
UCLA and Ohio State
are the top two teams in
the nation after the
weekend’s games.
Although Ohio State
is ranked No. 1 in both of the
already existing polls, UCLA was
given that distinction in the new
BCS poll. The Bruins have a tougher
schedule because Ohio State beat a
weak Northwestern squad last week
and early opponent West Virginia
lost this week to Miami, which
bumped down Ohio State’s power

Staff Wrlter

Tracking her opponents through the
net, she bides her time like a stealthy preda-
tor, awaiting the perfect time to strike.

The ball is set and poised for the kill;
she slams it home for a point.

A bit exaggerated, you say?

Nope. Only a day in the life of Pitt vol-
leyball star Peggy Meinhart.

Meinhart, a middle blocker for the
Lady Panthers, hails from Newton High in
Newton, Ill. A life-long athlete, she devel-
oped a love of volleyball in sixth grade.

“My mom was an oﬂicial, and I saw a
lot of games. I always wanted to play,”
Meinhart said.

Meinhart came to Pitt with a lot of
experience that she gained from playing for
a club team. She had been named to the all-
conference team three times in high school.

She also came to Pitt a national cham-
pion.

" Her most satisfying sporting moment
was her 13- to 15-year-old softball team’s
national championship. All that athletic

background made her quite a recruit.

According to head volleyball coach
Cindy Alvear, “Peggy is right where we
thought she would be.”

Meinhart has been a consistent starter,
and she was named to the. Big East All-
Conference Rookie team as a freshman in
1996.

“She has a tremendous work ethic and
is very persistent,” said Alvear.

Those qualities may be a function of
her life away from the hardwood at Pitt. A
mechanical engineering student, she has
earned two academic fellowships from Pitt
in engineering.

The skills required of her in academics
transfer well to the court.

According to Alvear, “Peggy’s greatest
strength may be her logical-analytical
skills. Her ability to process information so
quickly adds another dimension to the
game.”

This also aided in her transition from
high school to Division I volleyball.

“Peggy’s a great thinker. She mentally

Tom Ccimillo makes his debut as the picks man

The Bowl Championship Series
standings were released this week,
and they imply that strength of
schedule is very important and that
merely winning games is no longer
enough.

That means teams not only need
to win impressively, but they also
need their opponents to do well to
help their rankings. A big part of the
rankings is the strengtli of a team’s
conference, and this week there are
some important ‘conference games.
One of them is in the Big East,
where West Virginia and Virginia
Tech meet in Blacksburg, Va.
KDKA-TV sportscaster Bob
Pompeani has his take on that game:

Guest pick of the week by Bob
Pompeani:
West Virginia at Virginia Tech (no
line)

“The Mountaineers have been

exposed.  The Miami Hurricanes

blew them away rushing the foot-
ball. Look for Virginia Tech to do
the same. The Hokies suffered a
hoax two weeks ago when they lost
to Temple. They will not lose to
WVU.”

picked apart two weeks ago by Mike
McMahon and the Rutgers
receivers, which led to a surprising
loss. That’s not good 
for Pitt because one if
of the best college
quarterbacks,
Donovan McNabb, is
waiting for, the
Panthers to cgntinue
his phenome 1 sea-
son. It could be a Heisman season,
despite his team’s 4-2 record. Pitt
may make a big change at quarter-
back this week, possibly starting
junior-college‘ transfer Matt
O’Connor instead of Matt Lytle.

   
 

E--‘STUDENT

Apparently, O’Connor was sup-
posed to play more against Rutgers,
but that didn’t happen. Maybe coach
Walt Harris knows
something about this
junior that we don’t.
It’s time for Pitt to turn
the corner and win the
_ big games instead of
-*1   playing well against
 good teams, and losing.
The Panther defense will apply pres-
sure all day to disrupt McNabb and
the passing game, and Syracuse will
get caught off guard looking ahead
to West Virginia and then Virginia
Tech. Pitt will win this one in a

shocker, continuing its mastery of
Halloween games.

Four words I never thought

goes, “One is the loneliest number,”

will finish with. They already have
that one victory, while Rutgers is

rankings.

Buckeye head coach John
Cooper retorted, “Winning solves
everything,” in aclip on ESPN’s
“SportsCenter” Monday night.

UCLA and Ohio State are also on
top of both the AP and CNN/USA
Today Coaches’ polls. It is doubtful
that the Rose Bowl officials are
happy about giving up their matchup
of the Big Ten (Ohio State’s confer-
ence) and the Pac-10 (UCLA’s con-
ference).

According to the new system,
the hosting of the national champi-
onship game between the top two
teams will rotate among the Fiesta,
Orange, Sugar and Rose bowls. Then

FROM PAGE 10

the remaining conference winners
from the ACC, Big East, Big Ten,
Big 12, Pacific Ten and SEC will be
placed into the remaining three
bowls.

Pitt remains in contention for a
bowl game and must win four of its
remaining five games “S
to qualify. Considering
the five opponents for ‘
the Panthers include
Syracuse, West
Virginia and Miami, a
climb in the standings
of the Big East
Conference is difficult but possible.

This season, the Orange Bowl
will probably end up with the ACC
champion and Big East champion.
Florida State and Syracuse will be
the competitors if the current stand-

 

ings do not change.

This is where things get compli-
cated for the Big East. The second-
place team from the conference
probably will be invited to the Gator
Bowl. But if Notre Dame is not
given one of the eight spots in the
BCS, it will probably
be given the Gator
Bowl invitation
because of its national
popularity. Virginia
Tech is currently sec-
ond in the conference.

Virginia and Boston. College.

It is likely that a fourth team
from the conference will be included
in postseason plans, making the trip
to Memphis to play in the Liberty
Bowl or to Nashville to play in the
Music City Bowl.

Harold Graeter, the media rela-
tions director of the Liberty Bowl,
said, “We are still open. Miami has
called and talked with us about a
possible invitation, so we are having
discussions with the Big East
Conference.”

The officials of the Music City
Bowl have talked with Big East
commissioner Michael Tranghese,
but no agreements have been made
about including a Big East team.
There are also six other open spots
to include any eligible teams, no
matter the conference. So if a team
wins six games, it will probably be
in a bowl game.

Pitt happens to be in a confer-
ence where only one team graces the
top 20 in the BCS rankings. That
team is Pitt’s opponent on Saturday,
the BCS’ 20th-ranked team,
Syracuse. .

In addition to BCS bids, confer-

ences also gets other bids. All of the
other conferences in the BCS have
as many bowl agreements as the Big
East (3) or more.

“We [Big East] would rather
remain neutral and look at our
options than make an agreement
with a bowl that does not benefit
us,” Athletics Director Steve
Pederson said.

The Big East has a revenue—shar-
ing system in effect, where all the
money the conference’s teams
receive is divided among the eight
schools with significantly more
going to the teams that are invited to
bowls. According to Pederson, Pitt
received about $3 million last sea-
son. Most of it was used to pay for
the trip to the Liberty Bowl and
other relevant expenses involved.

Pitt hopes to have bowl travel
expenses again this season.

looking to move to .500 through
eight games in the season. When
was the last time that happened? A
ranked Tulane team beat up the
Scarlet Knights last week, but the
bleeding will stop against Temple,
which has had too long to think
about its upset win. Mike McMahon

Temple being favored.

North Carolina (+27) at Florida
State

The Tar Heels have finally
begun to look like the team that was
ranked in the top 10 in almost every
preseason poll. Their defense is for
real, and it looks like Ronald Curry
can play just as well as Oscar
Davenport at the quarterback posi-
tion. Unfortunately, the Tar Heels
are heading into Tallahassee, where
visiting teams come away with a
win. Although the Seminole defense
doesn’t post numbers quite as good
as past teams have, they are still
tenacious. Chris Weinke does just
enough to make his team successful,
and that’s all coach Bobby Bowden
is asking for. Don’t count this team
out of the national title picture yet,
as it barely will cover the spread.

Georgia (+11 1/2) vs. Florida (at

It may not be the swamp, but it’s
just as intimidating. Both teams are

but Georgia could use a huge win

against Florida, which is six places A

higher at No. 7. Maybe next year.
Steve Spurrier finally has one quar-
terback and will use every single
passing formation he can think of.
Rarely do the Gators lose two games
in the season, let alone two games in
the SEC. The Bulldogs did not look
impressive against Kentucky last
week, but maybe they were looking
ahead to the matchup with Florida.
What the team can look forward to
is a stifling defense and well-oiled
offensive machine. Finally, some-
one will cover the spread.

Texas (+17) at Nebraska

Although it was two years ago,
the Cornhuskers still remember the
day their reign in the Big 12 came to
an abrupt halt with a loss to the
Longhorns. Nebraska is now look-
ing up to Kansas State and needs to
win all its games before the big
showdown. The Huskers have been
less than impressive in piling up

seven wins, while Texas has come
on strong to win its last four, thanks
to Ricky Williams, this year’s
Heisman Trophy winner. Williams is
less than 500 yards away from pass-
ing Tony Dorsett’s Division I rush-
ing record but will have to wait a
few more weeks to accomplish that
feat. The rest of the Texas team has
not been impressive offensively, and
the defense has allowed a ton of
points and yards. Nebraska will cen-
ter its defense on stopping the run
and will use the option to perfection
when its has the ball. Nebraska will
cover the spread, proving it’s not
done for yet.

The Eagles have lost four in a
row, and it doesn’t get easier after
Miami with games against Notre
Dame, Pitt and West Virginia. At the
same time, the Hurricanes don’t
have it much easier, with a season-
ending date with No. 1 UCLA loom-
ing. But there’s one big difference:
Miami has confidence. The
Hurricanes are coming off a huge
road win against WVU and have a
quality group of players that seem to
have lost the attitude problem of the
1980s and early ‘90s. Edgerrin
James is having a fantastic season at
running back and will be used early
and often against BC. The Eagles
will continue to go in a downward
spiral, getting stomped by the
‘Canes, who cover the spread.

and Temple —— left on the schedule.
With any luck, the team got its upset-
loss for the year out of the way with
Rutgers, and if the Panthers can win
against the very beatable Temple and
BC teams, that leaves them again
having to take two of three against
Syracuse, Miami, and West Virginia.

Again, it’s not probable, but
without support, it just isn’t possible.

It all starts on Saturday when Pitt
resumes play at l7th—ranked
Syracuse.

Right now, there is a big question
over who should start at quarterback.
Some believe coach Walt Harris
might go with Matt O’Connor, who
has a year of eligibility left, instead
of Matt Lytle, who will graduate
after the season.

The Panthers should stick with
Lytle.

As Harris continually stresses,
the strength of the long—term football
program is more important than any
one game or one season.

If O’Connor were the quarter-
back of the future, I would be all for
inserting him in the lineup, but he’s
not. _

Lytle is the man who has the best
chance of getting us into the postsea-
son this year, and that is the best

O’Connor is a junior—college
transfer. He will graduate next year.
He has never been treated as the
quarterback of the future but rather
as a short-term backup.

The quarterback of the future
could be Chris Simms, the No. 1
high—school quarterback in the coun-
try who has Pitt on his list of the
final five colleges he is considering.

It also could be nearby Perry
High School’s Rod Rutherford, or
any other top—flight high—school
passer who is considering Pitt
because of Harris’ reputation for
coaching quarterbacks.

John Turman, another junior—col-
lege transfer, who is being redshirted
this season, could also be the next
quarterback.

Most likely, it is David Priestly, a
transfer from Ohio State who was
recruited to the Buckeyes by Harris
when he was the quarterbacks coach
there and will have three years of eli-
gibility left when he is free to play
next season.

But now, a win at Syracuse is the
most important thing for the
Panthers’ future.

A win is possible, and Matt Lytle

is the man who gives Pitt the best

chance to get it.

Brian Knavish is the assistant sports
editor of The Pitt News and knows
that crazier things have happened on
Halloween than Pitt beating

Syracuse.

; “At a time when
children suffer from

perhaps the gravest social
problems of any group in
the U.$., how do we ensure
that they grow up in the best
  environment possible?

(TIME Magazine, February 3, 1997)

YOU can be part of the growing movement to prepare to
meet the needs of tomorrow’s children by enrolling in the
University of Pittsburgh School of Social Work’s Program in
Child Development and Child Care. Through a combination
of hands-on practice in a variety of internship sites, and
classwork, you will learn how to use developmental rclation—-
ships, counseling skills, activity programming and program
design to promote positive child and youth development.

For further information and application packets for both the
upper division B.S. program and M.S. program, call
624-2909, send e—mail to narr+@pitt.edu, or call in person
