State Sen. Jane Orie, a Republican rep-
resentative from the North Hills, announced
the kickoﬂ of the Hearts of Steel Bracelet
Project Friday, a collaborative elfort to raise
money for the construction of a memorial to
the passengers and crew killed aboard
United Airlines ﬂight 93 during the 
attacks of Sept. 11. .

During a "press conference in the
William Pitt Union, Orie, who is coordinat-
ing the project, remembered the contribution
of the passengers and crew of ﬂight 93, say-
ing, “But for them, there would have been
even more catastrophe.” ’

According to investigators, ﬂight 93
crashed in Somerset County, killing all 43
people aboard, after passengers attacked the
hijackers. The passengers’ actions may have

possibly in Washington, D.C.

As part of the Hearts of Steel program,
Pitt’s School of Engineering Manufacturing

Assistance Center produced a series of ‘

bracelets commemorating the events of
Sept. 11, using steel ‘donated by Allegheny
Ludlurn Steel Co. 1 A

Orie described a grassroots eifort, and
said she and other Hearts of Steel partners
selected steel for the bracelets because of its
signiﬁcance to Westem Pennsylvania.

“Hearts of Steel is what this is all
about,” Orie said. “It’s our patriotism [and]
our steel—town pride coming out.”

Orie said that as she watched the events '

of Sept 11 unfold, the emotional impact
reminded her of Vietnam and of the bracelets

Pitt: Vendors to
return with    
new guidelines

KATE GIAMMARISE
Staff Writer

More than a week after its

S  » Thanksgiving deadline, Pitt issued new

guidelines regarding outdoor vendors
Friday. A

According to a University press
release, the new guidelines are “part of a
continuing effort to ensure the highest
standards of safety, good business prac-
tices and fairness relating to outsideven-
dors operating on the grounds of Pitt.”

-" A panel of seven administrators and
Student ‘Government Board President
Jeff Alex developed the rules. The panel
also sought input from student members
of Pitt Program Council and SGB.

The new guidelines allow eight
spaces for vendors outside the VV1lliam
Pitt Union. . According to University
spokesman Robert Hill, there may be

more than eight vendors afﬁliated with
’ Pitt, though no more than eight will oper-

ate on any given day. All vendors must
pass a background check and meet insur-
ance requirements. a
‘Furthermore, the vendors must use
the f‘uniform, sturdy and attractive tables
provided by the University.” Hill said
that in the past, the tables were coming
from student affairs and they weren’t
attractive and sturdy. “They were just
folding tables.‘ They‘ were.~rickety,” he
said. A
In addition to those rules, vendors‘
will only be allowed to operate between,
9 a.m. and 7 p.m. -Advertising displays
won’t be permitted without approval, and
prices must be clearly displayed. All ven-
dors must agree to a “no aggressive
sales” approach. Hill said this means that
vendors must stay in oriat their booths.
Students interested inpurchasing items
must approach them and not vice versa.
Furthermore, credit card and cell
phone companies now must give out a
“how to maintain good credit” brochure

T

with every blank application. Hill said
the companies must provide the

brochures; the University will not pro-

vide such a brochure.

' Also, vendors carmot sell or give out
food or beverages without written
approval. Hill said this rule was made
mainly because “the University has con-
tracts with food and beverage organiza-
tions, and we don’t want those interfered

with.”

Finally," vendors who sell goods —
such as posters or books — will be
charged $60 per day, a modest increase
from the former cost of $50 per day
before the new guidelines were put into
place. ' .
Vendors selling services, such as
credit cards or cell phones, will be
charged on a new scale depending on the
time of year. These vendors must pay

1 $200 per day during orientation and the

ﬁrst week of classes. The cost will be

$175 per day during the second week of

classes, $150 per day during the third
week of classes and $125 per day during
the fourth week of classes. The cost will
remain at $100 per day for the rest of the
year. Before the new guidelines went into
place, the cost was a ﬂat $100—per-day
rate. ‘

Hill attributed the cost increase to -

“the expense to the University for main-
taining the vendor program.” He cited the

new booths as an example of an expense

incurred by the program, adding that “we
felt the cost was too modest, and this is
more advantageous to the University.”

Hill was not sure whether the funds

raised through the vendor program
would continue to go to the Student

Organization Resource Center as they »

have in the past. 

As stated in the press release, ven-
dors must complete an application from
the Panther Service Center. The forms
will be reviewed, and vendors will be

notiﬁed within three weeks, according to

the press release.

These were not shouts] from pas-
sionate demonstrators, but rather quiet
reminders written on small white bags
cradling lit candles scattered around the
panther statue in front of the William
Pitt Union. The candles, lit to com-
memorate World AIDS Day on
Saturday, were festooned with bright
red ribbons and attracted passersby
who listened to several poems, includ-
ing a “Prayer of Hope,” and observed a

from AIDS. A

The vigil, sponsored by Pitt’s
Rainbow Alliance, served to celebrate
those living with HIV/AIDS, recognize
those who have died and remind people
that the disease is a threat to everyone.

“It’s important to remind students
how easy it is to transmit AIDS and to
know how many people die from it
each day,” said Kerianne, Ludwig,
office administrator for the Rainbow
Alliance. “AIDS and HIV are not limit-
ed to the gay community. It affects
everyone.”

“AIDS awareness »  .
is a very important
cause,” said Adelaina
Acosta, vice president
of the Rainbow

heartened by the fact

Panthers need No. 12 in Orlando

Think back for a moment to Oct. 20. On
that day, Pitt football was 1-5 after a 45-7
loss at Boston College.

People were questioning Walt 
coaching ability, especially his use of a no-
huddle offense. After the debacle in Chestnut
Hill, Harris told team members not to come
back unless they were willing to commit to
a higher standard of play.

Anyone who suggested that the
Panthers’ season would have ended any-
where except in the toilet bowl would have
been thrown into an asylum.

How times have changed

After Harris scuttled the no-huddle
offense, the team won ﬁve in a row, even
beating heavily favored Virginia Tech by 31
points. .
With their victory over Alabama-
Birmingham on Saturday, the Panthers ﬁn-
ished the season 6-5 and received a bid to
play the North Carolina State Wolfpack in
the Visit Florida Tangerine Bowl. The game
will take place in Orlando, Fla, at 7:30 p.m.
on Dec. 20. ' _

While the Tangerine Bowl is likely not
the one the Panthers aimed for at the begin-
ning of the season -— it’s the game for the
ﬁfth-place team in the Big East — we
should all be proud of the team for turning
the season around and making a bowl game.
The Tangerine Bowl, which is run by
Florida Ciuus Sports and played in the same
stadium as the Citrus Bowl, immediately
brings to mind the Citrus Bowl and the even

more prestigious Orange Bowl.

It also is a bowl game with a glorious
past. In fact, the Panthers played North
Carolina State there in 1978. It has not taken
place since 1983-, but this year Florida Citrus
Sports moved the Micronpc.oom Bowl from
Miami to Orlando and changed it to the
Tangerine Bowl.

Last year Pitt ﬁnished third in the Big
East Conference and made the Insightcom
Bowl in Phoenix. The last time the Panthers.
made two bowl games in a row was after the.
1982 and 1983 seasons, when they played in
the Cotton Bowl and Fiesta Bowl, respec-

' tively. ’

But the Panthers can’t pull through
without the 12th Man. ‘

The team no longer sucks. Fan support _'

should not suck either. It’s time to get ready
to support our team as they prepare to ﬁght
the Wolfpack Sticking tangerines in the pan-
ther statue’s mouth is one way to start.

We also would like to encourage every-
one to head down to Orlando andsupport the
Panthers.

It’s really easy to do, as Pitt Program
Council oifers a discounted bus trip," and

cheap airfare is simple to ﬁnd on_ the Internet. -

You could even go for the ultimate col-
lege experience — a road trip. Finals end
Dec. 15, which means you have ﬁve days to
explore all there is between here and
Orlando before you go to the game.

No. 12, the Panthers need you. Be there
to cheer them on'Dec. 20. 7

Toward the beginning of eighth
grade, I sat down with my parents to
watch yet another network miniseries.
One week and six hours of television
later, thanks to a clever bit of marketing
known as “The Beatles Anthology,” I
discovered an interest that .

But behindthat, people were always

trying to hold onto some sort of faith in .
A humanity to make things right, to look

beyond individual concerns to the
greater connection we, share. Harrison
perhaps said it best in his song “Within
8 You VV1thout You”: “And the

the next two years. .

I couldn’t tell you what

you.” A

A Seeing as I was 13
when the Beatles ﬁrst caught
my eye, it’s no surprise that
McCartney, “the cute one,”
rather than Harrison is my
favorite. But over the years
my appreciation for Harrison

rizing -every ' word. I

devoured every book I could get my
hands on telling me about the lives and
the music of John Lennon, Paul
McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo
Starr.

Four years since I turned the radio
back on, I still can’t listen to a Beatles
song without remembering everything
happening in my life the ﬁrst time I
heard it and how their melodies and har-

monies seemed to sum it’ all up. _The .

Beatles seem less like a band to me than
four old friends who have helped me
capture every moment, who’ve given me
the soundtrack to my life.

And not just my life. It’s hardly an
exaggeration to say that the -Beatles were
the voice not only of a generation, but a
century. The 20th century is often char-
acterized as responsible for the growth
of widespread materialism and mindless
mass culture. ‘ I

asanartist——andasavital
part of the Beatles —— has grown. In
many ways, he is responsible for the
manning of the band’s sound in their
later years. :
When Harrison noticed a sitar on the
set of “Help!” he decided to learn to. play
it. Soon he was adding its unique sound
to the Beatles’ next album, Rubber Soul.
His growing interest in Eastern religion
not only led the Beatles to India. in 1968
but also inspired the songs “The Irmer
Light” and “VV1thin You VV1thout You.”
In the last years of the band, his tal-
ent grew in leaps and bounds — “While
My Guitar Gently Weeps” is easily the
most memorable song on The Beatles
(also known as the “White Album”) and
the Abbey Road love song “Something”
was one of the group’s 27 No; 1 singles.

Alternative methods of fightingfinals anxiety

With the coming of ﬁnals hitting Total Request Live charts.

my anxiety G—spot with the explosive-

ness of a Tomahawk mis-
sile, I try to hold myself
together by remembering
how I got_punched in the
face a few weeks ago.
Still, I’m getting ahead
of myself. This whole story
started back in the fanciful
summer of ‘99. The econo-

bunch of _ computer—loving
geeks, while the Backstreet
Boys’ “I Want It That Way”

Way back then, I chanced -upon

seeing the splendid movie
“Fight Club” on the silver

- screen. Three times. If par-

ents want to blame any
media for causing violence,
they should all point their
angry Puritan fingers
directly at this ﬂick. Every
time I stepped out of the
theater, my brain swelled
with the hot, primitive urge
to sock someone in the gut
— or at least stab them.

Within a week, I was having regular

Rican buddy Zeligman —— and, of
course, he would whomp me.

Fast forward to a month ago: My
crew and I hit up a frat party and get
zooted with promptness. Walking back
home with my roommate, Mike, he
drunkenly puts his hand on my shoul-
der and slurs, “Ben,. I want you to hit
me as hard as you can.” I

What deja vu. i

Timid Ben: “What? Where do you
want me to hit you?”

Super-drunk Mike: “Surprise me
— no, hit me in the face, slut.”

And so it began. As I wound up, he
clenched his face‘ as hard as he could,
making him look like a grandpa suck-

ing an Atomic Warhead. I hit him.

“Dude, that was so weak. Do it
again.”

I knock him again with a bit more
force and he stumbles a bit. “OK, it’s
my tum,”iI say. I neatly take my glass-
es _off, scrunch up my face and close
my eyes waiting to get hit. It felt like a
full minute -— then crack.

Then we both start laughing like
giddy hillbillies. 0

The rest of the night consisted of
the two of us running around the dark
streets of Oakland, giggling like kids
at a park, intermittently stopping to
wallop each other right in the noggin.
If it was a movie, “MMMBop” would
be playing in the background.

, The best part was waiting to get
punched. In ridiculous anticipation,
excitement ﬂooded my Veins as if I
was drunk — not on too much Natty
Ice, but pure adrenaline. “Hit me.”
“N 0, you hit me.” “Hitme in the stom-
ach this time — really hard.” Our

imerry voices, mixed with the loud

smacking noise of bony knuckles
pounding‘ into ﬂesh, echoed about the
alleys. ‘We even bitch slapped each
other. V
I woke up the next day with a

vicious hangover. I stepped out of bed

and puked out a gallon of water. The
swollen left side of my face surged
with pain, giving me a thumping

. headache. Mike looked like a Picasso.

He also had a black eye.

I have to say that it totally ruled.

I’ll be the first one to admit that,
similar to bungee jumping, the whole
affair was full of empty bravery and
drunken stupidity. Still, why would I
ever voluntarily put myself in personal
dairger? ' ‘

Simple — it was a challenge. I
took the risk to confront my fears.
Besides, I’m going with Tyler Durden

‘ on this one by asking, “What kind of ‘

life would I live if I’ve never been
punched in the face anyway?”

i It was fun to push myself a little —
see what I got — do that whole eye ofg
the tiger thing. And the consequences
really weren’t that bad. They were part
of the fun. i » .

So now finals week almost seems

I like a piece of cake. Hell, getting in a
» real ﬁght doesn’t seem so bad any-

more. My suggestion: Get one of your
friends to really grill you in the mug. I
think you’ll be pleasantly surprised.
Just don’t be a moron and lose some
teeth over it. I can’t be held responsi-
ble for such a high level of idiocy.

Well kids, that was Ben Rubin’s last
column for this semester: Didn’t we
have fun together? He hopes to be
back next‘ semester if he doesn’t get
ﬁred for adding a “spoonful of love”
to the office water cooler:

Lennon and McCartney often had the

Pittsburgh’s eclectic Squcnk Opera returns to
city to stage adaptation of Dante’s Inferno

HEATHER BOWLAN
Senior Staff Writer

With the semester drawing to ‘a
close, many of us may be wondering
if hell isn’t located at Pitt du-ring
finals week. But before you write a
l0—page paper on that topic, perhaps
you’d better see Squonk Opera’s sur-
real musical expedition to the nether-
world, “Burn.”_

Based on Dante’s “Inferno” and
now playing at the City Theatre’s
main stage on the South Side, “Burn”
also locates hell in Pennsylvania —
albeit in the town of Centralia, a for-
mer coal town in the northeastern
region of the state that is most
notable for the mine fire that has
been blazing there for almost 40
years.

Just underground,

Centralia is certainly

home to a hellish heat. h — a face of lies’’ — and ” p . . . .

dents left after a govern-
ment buyout of the town,
garden vegetables burnt in the ground
and, supposedly, hot water heaters
weren’t necessary. About 20 people
remain, for reasons inexplicable to
the outside world. Or are they?

“Think about how you feel about
your own hometown,” said Jackie
Dempsey, who co—founded Squonk
Opera with Steve O’Hearn. “Would
you leave or would you stay?”

As Squonk Opera’s musical
director, Dempsey herself has been
loyal to Pittsburgh, her hometown
since she was only a few weeks old.
A Pitt graduate who describes the
‘Burgh as a-city with “ a lot of char-
acter and a lot of history  a ground-
ed place,” Dempsey taught piano at
the University for six years after get-
ting her bachelor of arts in piano
composition and music theory.

According to Dempsey, the'train-
ing she received at Pitt improved her

66

technique a thousand fold,”

enabling her today to multi-task

while onstage.

During “Burn,” Dempsey’s char-
acter, Pale Mary, often speaks to the
audience and other cast members
while seated at the piano. Other times
she moves around the stage playing
the accordion that is responsible for
much of Squonk Opera’s distinct
sound.

This sound, haunting and impos-
sibly chaotic, dominates the hour and
20 minutes of “Burn,” during which
the audience journeys with Don
Alegurski, also known as Dante of
the “lnferno,” through the nine cir-
cles of hell in Centralia, culminating
in the hottest ninth circle, his own
house.

For Don, hell is coming home,
and for the audience, «hellis more sur-

real —— the circles have
subtitles like .“truth with

compete with puppets

and multiple, sometimes"

moving, screen projections — than
we’d ever imagined.

Squonk’s distinctive blend of
music, acting and multimedia led
them to New York in 2000, perform-

ing for a brief time on Broadway at .

the Helen Hayes Theatre._

There is general agreement that
Squonk and Broadway didn’t quite
mesh. According to Dempsey, this is
because Squonk Opera “[isn’t]
Phantom of the Opera  thank God.”

Not that it wasn’t worth it.

Performing in New York brought
the troupe national exposure, and
soon after “Burn” closes at the end of
this month, Squonk Opera will be
heading out to tour this show and
their ‘ last,
“Bigsmorgasbordwunderwerk.”
Perhaps, though, Squonk’s success is
not because of recognition in the Big

My Father My King
Mogwai

Matador Records
<.2n2n2:1/2

Imagine the dramatic “Fifth
Symphony” by Beethoven is playing inside
your head. Now substitute electric guitars
for all of the strings and brass, add an appro-
priately powerful beat and run it through a
blender of effects courtesy of producer
Steve Albini. The result will be something
approaching Mogwai’s latest EP, the single-
track My Father My King, which was
released Oct. 23. 0

Although it is intended to be a compan-
ion piece to their 2001 full—length album
Rock Action, My Father My King is more
reminiscent of the post-rockers’ earlier
works. Rock Action showcases a more
mature. sound, full of string and brass

1 arrangements and solemn vocals.

The EP, on the other hand, is crammed
with two massive crescendos of feedback
separated by long periods of guitar-led
ambience, a throwback to their 1997 ofﬁcial
debut Young Team. _

The 20-minute composition begins
with someone plucking out a melodic line,
derived from a traditional Jewish hymn, on

an electric guitar. The first three minutes
slowly introduce an assortment of guitars
and percussion, with the forlorn melody
endlessly winding its way through the mix.

Then the distortion kicks in. During the
next few minutes, Mogwai set their 
andeffects pedals to total destruction, and a
truly cacophonous mess of feedback gradu-
ally emerges from the chorus of screeching
guitars. Yet the melody and rhythm hold
steady, and eventually the song winds down
into a peaceful blend of chiming guitars and
lightly "tapped high-hats.

Just when you expect the song to end
on a quiet note, the howling electric guitars
reappear around the 10-minute mark. This
time, crushing heavy metal riifs join and
soon overshadow the melody.

During the EP’s second dramatic
buildup, Mogwai generate an even more
massive sea of distortion than before. For"
the next 10 minutes guitars wail, drums
crash and mayhem ensues, producing what
could be the sonic equivalent of the Big
Bang. —

The original melody, along with any
semblance of order, is totally obliterated,
leaving behind deafening bursts of static.
Then after 20 minutes and 15 seconds of
elegant beauty and utter chaos, the song
abruptly cuts oﬁ.

It’s no wonder that The K.G.B. was
chosen to be a part of the “Roadtrip”

edy about sex, drinking, and. college

pared to the
other songs on

Lead vocalist Eric Tobias sings in a
youthful voice that is on key but other-
wise unimpressive. The playful
rhythms, melodies and instruments are
what give the album its flavor . By no
means is this an album thatiw attempt-
ing to change the world, but the lyrics
are catchy and it’s irresistible to tap to
the beat. ‘

“Plastic Soul” gives the impression
that it is played live for a club.

Trumpets and snapping give the song
character. “Once Upon A Time” sounds
uncannily similar to “Doo Wop (That
Thing)” by Lauryn Hill. Despite the
similar piano chords in the background,
it has its own attitude. This sweet, funky
song about a guy reminiscing about his
ex-girlfriend is easily the best on the-
album. i
The only complete dud of the .
album is “I’m a_Player,” which is a poor
imitation of R&B. Coming in at a close
second is “Isabella,” which attempts to
sound 1 Latin.
The guitars and
trumpets sound
OK, but then
Tobias’ whiny
voice tries to
play the part of
a .suave—sound-
ing Latin man.
Picture one of
the members of
Sublime trying
to sound like
Enrique Iglesias; it just doesn’t work.
But The K.G.B. quickly redeems
itself with “It’s Your World, Babe.” The \
song’s soulful melody and smooth har- ~
monies are much better suited to their.
voices. As Tobias belts out “baby baby
baby,” he also sings about seducing a
girl. But this time the song works. The

singing in their own style. a

Experimental is an understate-

A tip: Don’t concentrate too hard
on the lyrics, ethereally sung by Jody
Abbo’tt’s Virgie, Virgil from the

say/A yai o k.” .

Why opt for syllabic expression?
Why not? The idea behind the lyrics
was “to get a thought across without
actually explaining it in a language
[the audience understands].” Maybe
the best strategy is to look at “Burn”
as a world with its own language,
made-up of music and movement
physical expressions of abstract con-

cepts.

And what concept fascinates us '

more universally than hell? The other
.two books of Dante’s “Divine
Comedy,” “Purgatorio” and
“Paradiso,” go mostly unnoticed. It’s
“Inferno” that we remember.

av But it could be that’s because, as
Dempsey points out, “It’s just‘ more
fun to be in hell than heaven.”

“Burn” will ‘play at City Theatre
through Dec. 23. Call (412) 431-

A fruity finish
Victory secures Pitt’s        
bid to Tangerine Bowl

BEN JOHNSON
Staff Writer.

Orange fruit dotted the field
Saturday afternoon as the clock ticked
down the ﬁnal seconds of the game,
making one thing clear: Pitt is going
bowling."

The Panthers secured a bid to the
Tangerine Bowl with their 24-6 victory
over Alabama-Birrningham at Heinz
Field, closing out the regular season
with a 6-5 record and advancing to the
postseason for the second consecutive
year.

Mitch Morrall, senior events direc- .

tor of the Tangerine Bowl, formally
extended the invitation to Pitt and head
coach Walt Harris in the locker room
following the game.

“This is what college football is all
about,” Morrall said. “Weare looking
forward to hosting the Pittsburgh
Panthers.”

Pitt’s opponent in the game, which
will be played Dec. 20 at the Florida
Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Fla., is North
Carolina State.

“Finally I get to make a bowl. The
ﬁrst bowl I was redshirted and last year
I had knee surgery, so I’m pretty excit-
ed to go down to Orlando,” senior
receiver R.J. English said. ‘

- The Panthers dominated early, tak-
ing advantage of UAB’s inability to get

‘ anything going in its opening drive. Pitt

marched 66 yards down the ﬁeld in 10
plays, which resulted in a 6-yard touch-
down pass from David Priestley to
Antonio Bryant for the early lead.

The receiving core kept performing
— on the third offensive series, English
caught a 43-yard pass from Priestley
over a UAB defender and waltzed into
the end zone for the Panthers’ second
score of the game, making it 14-0.

“R.J. has been great for us,” Harris
said.

English thought the touchdown was
a big setback for UAB.

“I don’t think that the catch hurt
their self-conﬁdence, but it sure didn’t
help them,” English said.

The drive covered 54 yards in just
three plays. ' ' " ’

In the second quarter, the defense
came up with a turnover as free safety
Ramon Walker recovered a_ fumble,
giving the offense good field position.
Priestley once again aired it out, but this
time it wasn’t to English or Bryant.

Junior wide receiver Lamar Slade
was the recipient of the Priestley -pass,
and the connection resulted in another
touchdown, giving Pitt a commanding
21-0 lead.

_ A Just as things were starting to look
good for the Panthers, a key loss in their
offense occurred. Bryant left the game
early in the second quarter, with an
ankle sprain. ' A

“It’s hard’ to replace him,” Harris
said

to ﬁll the void left by Bryant.

Slade ﬁnished the game with ﬁve
receptions for 45 yards while English
had three receptions for 69 yards.

The Panthers’ backﬁeld featured a
trio of freshmanrunning backs. Marcus
Furman led the group with 71 yards
rushing. Raymond Kirkley finished
with 56 yards rushing and Mike
Jemison added 14 yards. ,

Pitt’s_ defense played at a high level
of intensity, holding the Blazers to only
two ﬁeld goals. The defense came up
with a fumble recovery and a turnover

\ on downs for the game.

Not only was Saturday’s game a
must-win for a bowl bid, but it was also
the last regular season game for the
seniors.

“I really enjoyed playing on this
squad,” Priestley’ said. ‘

Priestley also took the blame for the -

dismal beginning to the season. .

“It was the worst thing I have ever
been through. I think I was personally
responsible,” he said.

When asked about the ﬁve straight
wins to send the Panthers to the post-
season, Priestley said, “It was a real test
for me. We’ve turned it around so far

and hopefully we can -win the bowl

game.”

Ultimatum difference in season  

BRIAN GOLDMAN 
Staff Writer

The elimination of the spread
offense. The making of the Heinz Red
Zone at Heinz Field. The team as a
whole gettingvhealthy again. ‘The ulti-
matum from head coach Walt Harris
after the 45-7 debacle at Boston
College. " , ‘

Whatever it was that sparked the
Panthers football tearnback to life ﬁnal-
ly commenced with its 24-6 victory
over Alabama-Birmingham.

After a 7-4- season last year and a
spot in the Insight.com Bowl, the
expectations were high for the Panthers
in 2001. Maybe too high.

In early September, expectations
were so high that wide receiver Antonio
Bryant made a CD-ROM that prornoted
him .as a Heisman Trophy candidate.
ESPN.com predicted the Panthers to
ﬁnish third in the Big East conference,
and labeled Pitt the “spoiler” team in
the conference as well as the team with
the most potential. '

Week one looked good" as the‘

Panthers opened their 2001 campaign

‘ with a 31-0 victory over East Tennessee

State. - .

But Bryant sprained his ankle on a A

punt return and wouldn’t be 100 percent
healthy again for weeks. " '

His injury proved critical in week i 1

two when the Panthers were stunned
35-26 by South Florida. The ﬂoodgates
opened and the Panthers lost their next
four games to Miami, No..tre Dame,
Syracuse and Boston College.

The Panthers stood at 1-5, one
game away from being ineligible for a
bowl. ' .1
“I learned a lot about dealing with
adversity,” Harris said. “I did not do a

good enough job early, but I got help ‘

from my coaching staff 'and my
seniors.”
Harris was being criticized for

using a spread offense and rtmningthe is  I 0‘

Panthers crush Savannah State in lopsided victory

J OE MARCHILENA
Staff Writer

After a treacherous early schedule
that gave Pitt little time to rest, the

men’s basketball team, playing for the

first time in five days, rolled over
Savannah State Saturday night, 87-35,
to improve its overall record to 6-1.

“[Six games in 10 days] is difficult
to do,” head coach Ben Howland said
about the team’s early schedule. “We
took two days off just to get our legs
back.”

“Not having as many games in such
a short period of time gave us a chance
to prepare better for this team,” said
Brandin Knight, who scored 11 points
to go along with ﬁve assists in 21 min-
utes. , S -
The extra rest and preparation paid
off . for the Panthers — they held the
Tigers to the lowest point total by an
opponent since the 1951-52 season.
That year, Pitt lost to Penn State 24-9 on
the way to a 10-12 season.

Thelast time the Panthers held a
team to less than 35 points and won was
in a 34-32 win over West Virginia to
ﬁnish the 1948-49 season.

“I felt bad for those kids,” Howland
said about Savannah State. “They’ve
had to play four straight on the road.
Hopefully their team will bounce back
and have a good opportunity once they
get into some home games.” '-

Pitt used a zone defense and an
entire team effort to hold the Tigers to

. just 26 percent shooting from the ﬁeld

and outscored them 42-8 in the paint.
Ontario Lett led the Panthers with 14
points and Donatas Zavackas added 12
points, hitting all four of his shots from
the ﬁeld, including two for two from
behind the three-point line. 9

Toyian Williams led the Tigers with
10 points and two assists.

“We played good defense,”

~ Howland said. “I played the zone par-

tially to work on it, partially to slow the
game down.”

Redshirt freshman Mark McCarroll
helped the Panthers with 10 points and
eight rebounds, and Chevon Troutman
led Pitt with nine rebounds.

“Those -are good stats that bode
well for their opportunity,” Howland
said. “We need to have [the younger
guys] step up, especially those two.”

Pitt looked ready to put the game

away early, jumping out to a 19-4 lead
just six minutesinto the game. The
Panthers’ early run was highlighted by

two Knight three-pointers and.a reverse ,

layup by Julius Page, who. ﬁnished with
seven points.

*- Savannah State looked as if it might

gain ' some momentum after Carlos

Smalls was fouled on a three-point 1

attempt by Knight, giving the Tigers an
opportunity for a four-point play. But
Smalls missed the free throw that would
have pulled Savannah State within 14
points.

Knight then brought Pitt back the
other way, sinking another three, giving
the Panthers a 29-10 lead with just less
than’ nine minutes to play in the half.

The Panthers continued to run cir-
cles around the Tigers, going on an 18-
9 run, which included a monstrous two-
handed dunk by Toree Morris and
McCarroll’s one-handed tomahawk
dunk over two defenders.

“You could see that our guys
looked fresher today,” Howland said,
referring to Pitt’s 47-19 lead at halftime.

Despite trailing by 28 points,
Savannah State’ appeared re—energized
to start the second half. The Tigers cut

Pitt’s lead to 55-28 on Alvin Payton’s
only basket of the game.

But the Panthers ended any chance
of a Tigers comeback by scoring 11
unanswered points, going up 66-28
with 10:26 left in the game.

Even though the Panthers bounced
back after a tough loss to South Florida,
Howland was still upset with the team’s
execution on some plays. '

“We’re trying to put in new plays
all the time,” he went on to say. “We’ve
got a lot of new guys and about three or
four times we forgot what we were
doing right after the timeout. I am glad

that we got back on the winning [track] _

today.”

The Panthers hope that their big
win will propel them into what
Howland called a tough upcoming
week in which Pitt will face St. Francis
(Pa.) and Penn State.

“It’s also the week leading up to ‘

ﬁnals,” Howland said. “The guys are
going to have a lot of stress having to
do with their academic responsibilities
and getting things ﬁnished by the end of
next week. We want to take it one game
at a time, but We’re one game away
from where we want to be.”

Pitt finishes season strong

Rutgers, West" Virginia and UAB
remaining, it seemed possible to do the
improbable. The only two teams
remaining with a winning season were
Virginia Tech and UAB, with UAB
winning in a weak Conference USA
schedule.

“I’d rather be losing early in the
season than finishing with a losing
streak,” freshman tailback Raymond
Kirkley said. ‘

On Oct. 27, something remarkable
happened. Both the offense and the
defense played to their potential and
dominated Temple, winning 33-7.

Harris had gone away -from the
spread offense and stopped using back-
up quarterback Rod Rutherford for
series of plays. ' g —

Still, no one believed. It was
Temple and Temple was almost booted
out of the Big East. Next week, there
would be something to prove against

’ Virginia Tech. 1. .

They successfully proved their tal-

I ent as the Panthers rolled over the

Hokies '38-7. Priestley » and Bryant
hooked‘. up for two touchdowns, and
there was now something to believe.
The next week at Rutgers wasn’t
even‘ a game. It was 42-0 at halftime and
the Panthers cruised on for the victory.

Now Pitt was 4-5 with two games left at

West Virginia and home against UAB.

The Backyard Brawl is always
tough, and it proved so, as the game
went down to the wire, but the Panthers
held on for a’ 23-17 victory.

Now all of a sudden the Panthers
were 5-5 and one win ‘away from the
Tangerine Bowl.
