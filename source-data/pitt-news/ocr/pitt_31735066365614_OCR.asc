CAMPUS NURSERY STUDENT “e|ects" reading as his school ac-
tivity. .

Creativity emphasized
at Campus Nursery

by VICKI VETERS

While their mothers attend University classes. children . at the
Campus Nursery and Child Study Center are doing some creative
learning of their own. _ .

Stressing that the Center is not a day-care center, Ruth ‘Cu-
prak, Coordinating Teacher said, “the emphasis is on creative learn-
ing and, not on merely babysitting.” °

Besides painting easels and building blocks'for expression, the

- children are encouraged to express their feelings to each other and

to elect the activities they wan_t to participate in.

- “The expression of feelings is essential to successful social ‘in-
teraction, and so we avoid disputes among the children by having
them explain how they feel to one another,” Cuprak said.

‘ On a typical afternoon, the first floor of the building at 4100

Alequippa reverberates with the sound of rhythm drills, teachers
and children reading aloud, a child-produced skit, or the click of

' dominoes on round wooden table.

And Cuprak noted,«“there is a joint emphasis on both educa-
tion and activities.” -

Although Cuprak explained that the main purpose for institut-
ing the center “was to give young mothers a cliance to attend
college,” the center also provides on-campus learning experiences
for students who plan to work with young children.

The instructional personnel of the Campus Nursery School
consists of a Coordinating Teacher, Cuprak, two demonstration
teachers, an Instructional Aide, and an Administrative Aide. Two
teachers are also present at each daily session.

Each trimester the staff of the Nursery has at least one pri-
vate parent-teacher conference with the parents of each’ child to

University reverses decision

Wed., Jan. 26, 1912  

Campus cops reinstated

by POHLA SMITH
-' News Editor

Two‘ campus policemen, dismissed from the
force because of their alleged involvement in an
assault against a fellow officer, will be reinstated
without back pay, effective February 1.

’ According to Vice Chancellor of Operations
Joseph Dutton, the decision to dismiss the men
was reviewed and reversed after their Union rep-
resentative;and members of the University com-
munity protested the disciplinary measures.

Although the fired men, Officers John Wil-
liams and Jerry Brown, had originally requested
that their appeal be reviewed by a neutral arbi-
ter after negotiations between management and
their union, Teamsters Local 249, proved unsatis-
factory, their union agent, Richard Peluso, recent-
ly requested the University review its decision.

The request was reportedly made to avoid the

‘lengthy and expensive" ‘procedure of arbitration

and, said Peluso, because he "“felt (the Univer-
sity) didn’t have a good case.”

At the same time as the appeals, Dutton said -

he was contacted by "over 250 people;'_protest-
ing management’s decision. ,

V ‘_‘A number of administrators’ were involved,”
Dutton said, adding that he had talked with both
black and white administrators during a two and
one-half week period. I

Peluso claimsthat the Union had “assistance ' P

from a few Black people in the University. They
had interceded in _‘the men’s behalf and’ asked
the Chancellor to reinstate the men,” he said.

Dutton said the racial allusions had no influ-
ence on his department’s ultimate decision.

“A racial issue was made out of .what' was
not a racial situation.”

Theiincident was reviewed by Dutton, Joseph

State Secretary of Education.»
John Pittinger Monday declared a

The moratorium will halt action

Deck of the Insurance Office. The decision was 

then made to reinstate the two officers, although-
they will not receive back pay for work missed
since their dismissal December 6.

“It was determined the severity of the punish- 3“

ment was too severe,” said Dutton. He added

that the tight job market the fired men would face ,

“There was nothing to be gained by keeping

these men out in a down-employment market,”‘”

he said. . -

Though Dutton admitted’ the pressure on him"‘"~(:

Trees Lot A

by RON LOZOWSKI P
Feature Editor ‘

University commuters have
thus far failed to take advant-
age of the recently opened
Trees Hall Parking Lot.

Though 400 spaces are re-
served for ‘student use, the
average turnout for recent
days has hovered in the 70’s,
according to figures compiled

by parking lot attendants. Over ,

80 percent of the available
spaces remain empty.

A basketball game was the
only event to push a daily total
over the 100 mark. .

Commuters using the lot re-
marked that, though generally
satisfied with the facility, they
are somewhat distressed by
its distance from the main
campus. It may be that stu-
dents “just don’t want to walk,”
speculated an attendant.

This should not prove to be
a deterrent, argued Commuter
Association President Margie
Masilunas. She pointed out
that the campus bus runs regu-
larly between Trees Hall and
-the Cathedral, - free of .charg

Masilunas urged commuters-

to use the facility, stressing that
the charge is only 50 cents per

day, and that the lot is well lit-

at night. She contended that “we
don’t have any publicity as yet.
It will take about a month to
catchon.”  . '

Since the lot was constructed
on the site of a former cemetery,
Masilunas was asked whether she

_ In a letter to university officials, P
Pittenger said he would review
the building programs of each
school with its president or chan-
cellor to determine if the pro-.
grams are in line with the prior-
ities of the Shapp administration.

Those priorities, he said, are:

1) Utilities for maintenance of
normal operations;

‘ 2) Replacement, of existing fa-
cilities which will not increase
present enrollment or existing

‘ programs, and
'3) New facilities needed to ac-

commodate new or expanded
programs.

felt students avoided the lot as
haunted. ‘

“I don’t think that has any-
thing to do with it,” she replied.

While students are steering
cleariof the lot,»vandals appear
to entertain no-such qualms. Win-
dows in the attendant’s booth
have‘ been broken, forcing him to
retreat to his car for warmth.

Pittenger noted that the projects
halted have not been opened to
bids or approved by the General ‘
State Authority.

An Education Department offi-
cial said that Pittenger was not
opposed to any specific projects,
but that the Secretary, who was
sworn in Jan. 3, wants to scrutin-
ize programs planned before he
took office.

“He inherited a hell of a big pro-
gram.” said the official, “and
what he’d like to do is kind of back
off and get a look at it.”

yerplexes commuters
 _l V ‘by MARY WELTY V
What happens when Pitt commuters find themselves faced with

n-.8’t_o 10 inch snowfall any regularclass day?

.~*If,‘Chancellor Posvar finds/it necessary, he. issues the order to close
‘school. This is the standing unwritten procedure that the Commuter
's"’sio'cigation (CA) has been trying to clarify since the end of last term.

'fEd Goralczyk, past vice-president of CA, met with Rhoten Smith.

firid out if a school-closing policy existed. He was then informed of the
bove'policy. ’
 Then Goralczyk asked Smith what could be done about the students
missing exams on any day that it snowed. Goralczyk cited several

implaints lodged by commuters that on such days they had missed a
scheduled test because of increased traffic tie-ups and the teacher had
enalized them for this.

_-:“D_r. Smith was ‘greatly alarmed to hear of such practices," said
Goralczyk. “He couldn’t believe that this was true and promised to in-
sftitute a policy to send memos out to all of the deans that on bad days
’stIi_dents9,not be penalized in any way for missing a test." ‘

ff: Goralczyk hailed this as a good idea especially if it snowed heavily
o_n:one of the final’s days. I 4
 According to_Smith, he only raised the question of what type of po-'
licy existed for closing school. “I raised the question at a vice-cha_ncel-
IoI_"_s meeting and found no developed policy, only -an unwritten pro-
cedure,” he said, ‘
 “I told the-CA about this procedure which generally comes into use
Qn'ly every four or five years. There was no specific policy set up for
tuydentsi who ‘couldn’t make it to their exams.”

In response to numerous
abuses, campus security has been
tighted in the dormitories, but the
measures are not foolproof.

I The Pitt News has received com- -

plaints from dorm residents rang-
ing from invasion of privacy to
theft.

Mostof the abuses have been at-
tributed to dorm students, them-
selves, as ‘in cases of “peeping
toms" on women‘s floors in the
Towers or thefts from unlocked
rooms. ~

Students complain that anyone
can gain access to the Towers by
waiting until a student with a key
enters or being admitted by any-
one inside.

John Vrana, Director of Hous-
ing, reported that sudent ID
checkers will not be manning
their posts during January. as

part of an experiment to deter-.

mine whether or not their pre-
sence has been of any value. '

‘ The people who have been work-
ing at the security desks prompt-
ed this experiment by questioning
their own efficiency in prevent-
ing unauthorized entries to the
Towers. ~ , ' "

The University Housing Office
has been attempting to deal with
problems caused by non-students
or non-dorm residents. ’

Security doors have been‘iristall-
ed in the Towers. All dorm stu-
dents have keys to thesedoors and
theoretically only Towers resi-
dents and their guests can enter
any one of the Towers.

Vrana admits that although
these doors sometimes break
through overuse, they are kept in

I the best possible repair.

Vrana told the P/itt News that
the Housing Office has_secured ev-
ery door possible in the Towers
with locks or aIarms.*Som.e doors

are required by law to remain un- _
« locked, he explained.

Mike Corletti, assistant super-

intendent of Campus” Police, ex-
plained that securitysmeasures

‘for the Towers are designed by the

Housing‘ Office.

Bob Redick, head resident in the
Towers, ' explained that though
more elaborate security systems
are available, they are not'put into
effec_t because the students don’t
—want'them.

In some houses in the Towers,

special doors are placed at the en-

trance of the hall ways and J the
doors leading to the stairways can
only beopened with a room key.

These systems have been in-
stalled on floors where the major-

ity ‘of students have asked _for

them.

According to Redick, many stu-
dents consider the measures

_"Gestapo tactics” and sabatoge
the locks on‘ the security doors.’

Redick I

,-“There’s a conflict,”
stated. “People want security, but
they don’t want inconvience.”

‘ Redick explained that there is
one campus policeman on duty at
all times in the Towers, one in the
Quad, and several patroling
Forbes Ave. in addition to a Dorm
Sergeant. He also stated that
these officers have always been

prompt in answering complaints.
The Pitt News recently received

an ’ annonymous letter in which

dent occurred on two separate oc-

casions with other studehts.

Vrana also received the same

letter. Investigations by both the‘,

Pitt News and the Housing Office

proved fruitless in establishing

the authenticity of these reports.

.-Though the Housing Office and
the Pitt News received the letter

the incident was not reported to

the Campus Police or any of the
Towers personnel:

~ Redick and Vrana both stated

that they questioned all of the
RA’s in the Towers and the head
residentsand no one had received
a report of suchincidents.

Corletti stated that although
most incidents occurring in the
Towers are reported to the Cam-

pus Police-, no reports of armed“

Graduated tuition plu

by EVAN PATTAK

Associate Editor

Though it won’t be implemented until September,
lege’s graduated tuition plan is already having a tonic, effectvo

the school’s flagging enrollment.

Armed with the promise of.tuition based on income, Beloitre
cruiters are attracting crowds of 50-60 high school seniors where
they previouslydrewonlyahandful. _ -  . *

“We have more applicants than we have ever had in our :_lIlS
revealed Dr. Edwin Wilde, Vice President ‘for Planning and
developer of the graduated tuition plan. it .

According to the plan, individual tuition rates will be based
on the total of a student’s income, his family’s income, and"10pe’

cent of their assets.

Students whose base figure is $7,000.or less, for example,’ wil
pay $500. per term, the lowest rate. Students whose base figure’ 
$21,000 or more will pay $1,650 per term, the highest and curren
rate. There are 40 different tuition rates. -.  

Wilde said he devised the plan when a survey he conducted”
showed that a disproportionate amount of Beloit’s 1,700 studentse
88 percent—come from high income families, while only two per

cent come from lower income families.

This demonstrated to Wilde that “what our program wassup

 PIRG personnel will be stationed at key locations on campus with
}},petitions for students to sign. The petitions urge the establishment of
A a PIRG chapter here.

_   In effect, PIRG provides students with the tools to have a concert-
;- ed impact on the outside world. .

. Although PIRG is open-ended and cuts across ideological lines, it
*-is likely to be a vehicle for furthering consumer rights, environmental
protection, and an end to discrimination against blacks and women.

T If established at Pitt, PIRG will utilize the precept of grass-roots
I democracy. The student body will elect a PIRG_Board, through which
r: itwill channel ideas for research, projects, and crusades.

ii”  The Pitt Board will, in turn, funnel these ideas through a Western
—‘ Pennsylvania PIRG Board, which will consist of representatives from
 area colleges and universities. '

_ __ters. In Oregon and Minnesota, where PIRG is already active, PIRG
.,,;'has proved extremely successful. in such areas ,‘3_S environmental pro-
~j ‘ftection and consumer safety.

 . The success or failure of PIRG at Pitt will depend on the petition
 ‘campaign during the next three weeks. If a significant number of stu-

- will behard pressed to reject a plea for a PIRG chapter here.
»,The success or failure of the PIRG petitioner-s will also say a great

 . Another explanation of student apathy——namely, that students are

PIRG will not swallow up the time of students who are concerned
but busy. Moreover, it is an excellent mechanism for having an impact
on the system. ’

Through student monies, PIRG will secure the services ‘of social

Are fraternities outdated? Re-
cently many educators and stu-
dents have been asking this ques-
tion. And after reading college
__.newspapers or taking a look at a
moderncollege campus, you

 , might be inclined to ask that same

question.

  During the past 10-. years or so,
-fraternities have been attacked

for many reasons. But let us now
consider their usefulness to the

; .4», W college student.

A Critics insist that fraternity
groups no longer serve a mean-

if H’ '— -ingful purpose. Their social func-

tion has been replacedby college
sponsored events, a growing num-
ber of student— oriented night

 ' _ ispots, more affluent students, and

increased mobility.
Secondly, colleges used to de-

 skills and power which governmental and business institutionsthave.

" The investment per student is modest——$2 per term.

A If approved, PIRG will be established by adding a $2 per term fee

.  to the Student Activites Fee. _ ,

1 A .— But the payment of the $2 per term will,.in effect, be strictly volun-

V tary.

. Any student who cannot afford the $2 per term or who does not wish
’ to_ contribute money to PIRG will be eligible for a full refund—no ques-

' rtions asked.

A ' Thus, the University can serve as a collection agency for PIRG
-irwithout coercing students to get involved in publicvinterest research
' and pressure.

 _ »f./ This should not jeopardize the University’s tax-exempt status.’

\

_ So, when you see the IPIRG petitioners, keep in mind that you are
, -/not committing yourself to pay $2 per term, nor are you committing

: If you sign the PIRG petition, you are merely expressing your sup-
port for the concept of PIRG and you are enabling other students to pool

What purpose then do fraterni-

obvious, at least to the educa-
tors. As the size and complexity
of our colleges increases, the stu-
dent may easily become lost in
large lecture classes and imper-
sonal living complexes.

The modern fraternity can serve
by providing a small living unit_
with which the alienated student
can identify. In the fraternity, a

his chosen friends in a relaxed at-

by ARNIE STEINBERG
Elections Committee Chairman

“That was one of the dirtiest. nastiest run po-
litical campaigns I’ve ever seen.”

This is a quote I heard many times both during
and after the recently ended 1972 Student Govern-
ment elections. To think more closely on this, I
would agree that some of the statements made_dur-
ing the candidates’ debates‘ could be termed
“nasty,” but “dirty” is another issue itself.

To me, these so-called dirty remarks served
the new Student Government wel1—they killed some
of the student apathy so easily found at Pitt, and
brought out 1835 voters——twice as many as last
year’s turnout. I say this serves the new Student
Government well simply because it stands to rea-
son that the more people voting an official in, the
more his claim legitimacy.

This year’s election was comparatively “clean.”
Thus far there have been no complaints on elections
proceedings, and any complaints I can foresee will
probably be of a “sour-grapes” nature from one of
the losers. '

The results of the election are very interesting.
Virtually all who gained bad

reputations while in office ‘no longer occupy

SGposititions. This opens the door to many paths.
First, the people coming into office do so with no
already-formed biases against the Pitt News, the
major campus communication medium. Taking a

  

ﬁxpathy yields popularity

SC election review: nasty, not
 dirty campaigns dispel apathy

 

 

past case in particular. last year’s Social Commis-
sion came into office with a negative view (pre-
formed) of the Pitt News.

The end result was . unfortunate for both organ-
izations—they literally "checked each other out."
Because the new officers are coming into their posi-
tions fresh, no such tension should exist. They and
the Pitt News should adopt a policy of cooperation
rather than of hostility.

Another area of past shaky relations has been
with the administration. Locked-door Student Asso-
ciation meetings, unauthorized spendings, ques-
tionable fund management, secret locations of So-
cial Commission meetings, and secret agreements
will all be things of the past. I think the administra-
tion will do its part if Student Government does its.

Finally, there is the area of Student Govern-
ment-student body relationships. 1835 students
voted. Therefore, for one reason or another, 1835
students cared. Now is the time for many of these
students to get involved. Voting is just the first
step; there are many committee positions available
for those who apply. .

If this year is a bad year, the blame will have
to be shared between both Student Government and
the students who either didn’t take the chance to
participate, and those who fell down in the job.
Hopefully, these are the guidelines Student Govern-’
ment for 1972-73 will follow.

Editor:

Student apathy is, as we all
-know, a recurring topic of discus-
sion around this University. True,
this fact is not astounding revela-
tion, or even very surprising. '

What is surprising, though is
that because of this apathy, Stu-
dent Government has evolved into
little more than a popularity con-
test. ‘ ~

Never was this more apparent
than during the recently held SG
elections in which Tom Bailey
was chosen president. After lis-
tening to him speak on the eve of
the election, someone next to me
commented, “One thing you can
count on is that Bailey will never

directly contribute to something
and has a chance to directly con-
tribute to the success of the broth-
erhood. -

Encouragement andsupport will
be given to him when he is low
and, a’ little kiddingly, when he is
too high on his horse. A brother-_
knows that in this atmosphere he
IWUI be a respected individual.

I am not advocating: that every
student should spend his college
life in a fraternity house; the
university community and the out-
side world should attract much of
his energy.

However, a shelter where a stu-
dent can relax, relinquish his
thoughts and share his ideas only
to emerge with a renewed confi-
dence and enthusiasm is sorely
needed on today’s college cam-
pus.

be elected.” Unfortunately, how-
ever, Wednesd_ay’s election prov-
ed that there really isn’t much one
can count on anymore.

The night of the candidate de-
bate, he was over a half an hour
late, ‘and, inthe view of what he
had to contribute, he would have
done us all a favor if he hadn’t

shown up at all. When he finally ,

did arrive, he grinned nervously

' and sheepishly admitted, “Well, I

really haven’t prepared anything;

now that I’m up here I do_n’t know

what to say.”

A This was followed with a few H

more equally profound comments,
after‘ which he sat down and
wasn’t heard from again for the
rest of the evening. It was just as
well though, for it was pretty ob-
vious that he really didn’t have
much knowledge of the workings
of Student Government.

Dennis Concilla, on the other
hand, possesses that which Bailey
is" noticably lacking - namely, the
first hand experience of_ having
worked inside Student Govern-
ment.

In his statement in the Pitt News,
Concilla discussed the issues and

tiously managed to avoid them.
Bailey told of things he’d ‘‘like to
do,” but“just"what has he done to
justify his running for such an
office?

Bailéy’s limited experience in-
cludes: summer orientation,
freshman weekend,- and mentor,
activities which hardly make him
a natural candidate for president
of Student Government.

Just last Monday, the Pitt News
ran an editorial endorsing Con-
cilla for president. The article
was entitled: “SG Aches for Lead-

ership.” Unfortunately, in view of '

the outcome of Wednesday’s elec-
tion, Student Government is still

Sadly enough, what did cost
Concilla the election was apathy-
apathy on the part of astudent
body who couldn’t have possibly
given a damn. Otherwise, Tom
Bailey would never have been
elected 'to.an office he knows lit-
tle or nothing about.

 

At that “great debate” that took
place last Tuesday, someone vol-
unteered the suggestion that Stu-
dent Government be abolished and
a professional hired in its place.

‘At the time, I though this an odd

request since Student Govern-
ment should, quite obviously (or
so I thought) he -run for and by the
students themselves.

Since the election, however, I
have come to the conclusion that
this idea isn’t nearly as absurd
as it sounded initially. For, in a
university where it is possible to
be elected with the backing of the
Greeks and a few friends, with lit-
tle emphasis placed on ability or
competence, I think it’s time Stu-
dent Government be exposed for
the farce it has become.

After all, if candidates are go-
ing to be elected on the basis of
how many friends they have, then
why bother to devote a whole sec-

- tion of the Pitt News to the candi-

dates views? Or why bother going
through the trouble of staging a
candidate debate? And, finally,
why bother holding elections at
all? (Since the results were whol-
ly predetermined, anyway?)

We’ve all heard of guys "being
chosen token Homecoming
"Queens” at various colleges and
universities. This farce isn’t near-
ly as damaging as the one that
was perpetrated last Wednesday.

Maybe we should have elected
Baily Homecoming Queen - in-
.,stead. It certainly sounds a lot
less ridiculous than Tom Bailey——

"Student Government President.” -

Pitt News Drama Critic

When June Allyson descends the staircase
about five minutes into No, No, Nanette, the audi-
ence is moved to applause that is just as laudatory
as it is appropriate when a star enters the stage.

Somehow, even for a brief interlude, Allyson is
as young and radiant as she was many years ago
when her figure was ever-present on stage and
screen. ‘

Although age has taken its toll, in the nostalgia

. of Nanette that revives 1925 for one evening, the

pretense of the stage is unmistakably true. In the
elegance and accuracy of Nanette’s revival, that
mystical separation between then and now is no
more. Yesterday becomes today, and the era that
has long since vanished along with the dances,
song's,and the stars who performed them, is alive
and well, even if just for awhile.

It is a ‘superb recreation from" a time that rock-
ed with sequins and knickers. Nanette swings, ca-
resses, and rejuvenates the mind. It is a return trip
to the theatrical paradise that made a legend of the
Great White Way.

As a revival of the musical comedy stage of 47
years ago, it is not only very entertaining, but also
highly interesting historically. The history of mu-
sical comedy has its seeds in vaudeville, and this is
most evident in Nanette.

Orchestrations and lyrics are simpler and; less
abstract than the music of today. Song and dance
numbers are well-structured and tightly choreo-
graphed. Everything is in its place.

 

 

’Nanette’ revives

Great White Way

Performers step out of the show and thank thew

audience for their appreciation and some of the
numbers have built-in curtain calls. Very little is
open ended. ‘

Above all, the show is anti-climatic, or in other
words. it’s over before it’s over. Everyone comes
on stage and joins together to say "Well that’s all

. . . its over . . . hope you enjoyed yourself . . . we
did!”

Through it all are some fine dance numbers,
some catchy songs Tea for Two and I Want to be Hap-
py and a very talented and energetic chorus dancing

on beach balls, forming magnificent chorus lines, '

and adorning themselves with beautiful costumes.
It is a strong cast and a strong show.

Highlight of the evening is Judy Canova, the
lovable, sarcastic, and grumpy family maid who
talks to her vacuum cleaner, wrinkles her face, pops
her eyeball, and twangs with a country drawl that
is reminiscent of her comic heyday.

Dennis Day as Jimmie is especially strong, as
are Dana Swenson (Nanette), Bill Biskup (Tom),
Sandra Deel (Lucy), Jerry Antes (Billy), and Flora
Latham, the most buxom and presumptious of Nan-
ette’s three girl friends. A

In the great trials and tribulations of our mod-
ern times it is refreshing to look back at the frivol-
ous and slightly naughty 20’s. Such a moment is
joyously captured for the next three weeks at the
Nixon Theatre.

Redhone speaks wigths

1111-forked tongue  

by WILLIAM IYI. SMITH '

The’ Gila Monster and his funky
band of incredulous Indians are
back with Message from a Drum
(Redbone’s new album).

The term “Indian Funk” has '

come out of the strong rhythms
and dynamic accents so typical of
the group. This latest collective
creation is no exception.

The grogp relies heavily on
these tried and true techniques,
though there is a tendency to lean
more toward vocal development.

Lolly Vegas’ jazz influence is
also more obviously shown. Each
side of the album has an l8-sec-
ond jazz interlude titled “Maxs-
plivitz” ‘and “Perico,” respec-
tively, and the cut titled “Emo-
tions” works into a nice jazz jam
where Lolly uses his guitar like a
horn man would.

The Top 40 “Witch Queen of
New Orleans” is on this album
and in addition to the usual
rhythms, a mellow minor string

‘crescendo can be heard here.

The majority of the album is
predictable but there is one def-
initely unredeemable tune en-

up Panthers ’ship

by JERRY MYERS
, ‘Sports Editor
TiE.ven above the most deafening crowd explosions, one dis-
tinctive voice pierces the roar, shouting crisp, staccato instruc-
gtionsto his young wards on the court. The general is Pitt’s As-
Tsistant Mentor Tim Grgurich and the pawns are hislatest crop
of recruits, affectionately known as the Cubs.

A Through a processof shaping, that in some cases began as
7rnany.,as four years in the past on a neighborhood playground
‘court, Grgurich produces the guts of what the Panthers are
‘made of. Taking the raw materials and unpolished skills of the
average high school ballplayers, the 29 year old bachelor drills,
grills, andlinstills in these boys the essence of a basketb_all sys-
tem which they will need in order to integrate themselves onto
the varsity. His success has been phenomenal. '

 ’ “We start working on the kids during their sophomoreor
"junior year -of high school,T" related Grgurich. “If they’re a city
ballplayer we may even contact them in their freshman year if
_he,,coach lets us. " ‘

 Grgurich has been around Pittsburgh for a long time, and in
that time has had a chance to make numerous contacts. Going
-5,the..whole, route, as a student, graduate student, and finally
.coach, the former Pitt Panther star -guard has proved himself
,.to be one‘ of the bright, up-and-coming ' '-

iyoung coaches in the country. . . '
 According I to his “boss” Buzz Ridl,
,‘.‘Tim is one of the best fundamental coach-
"’es..in,the country. He does a fine job of in-
jtegrating freshman ballplayers into the
varsit_y.’.’ ,

" “I enjoy‘ freshman ball,” Pitt’s top re-
rfcriiiter commented. “It gives you a chance
' to work with the boys you’ve recruited. I’m
{more excitable during a freshman ball-
game than when I’m sitting next to Coach
Ridl a.t the varsity games.”

 Anyone who is located anywhere near
the Cub bench during a frosh contest is cer-

  

GRGU RICH

tainly aware of Grgurich’s excitability. Pacing up and down,
‘shouting-instructions, swearing to himself and at the officials,
the veteran of seven coaching seasons makes his presence felt.
One can’t help wonder how his players react to the constant.

:.f presence of Grgurich on the bench shouting instructions to them.

‘ - “He gets’ the most out of his ballplayers,” related the
team’s trainer, Bob Mangini _ , who has been with the
Cubs three years now. “He’s the best coach I’ve ever trained for.
The players really like him and they play well for him." '

' recently observed, “They play like they’re in the NBA.” Captur-
ing their first seven -games, then succumbing to the superior
‘fire power of Robert Morris and Duquesne, the Cubs have shown
that they can hold their own against the best. There only happens
;to be two scholarship ballplayers on the squad, Kirk Bruce and,
"Willis Cardot. I '

Compiling a 70-28 record to.date, Grgurich seems ripe for a I
head coaching job somewhere. Pitt would obviously hate to lose
thim.', but as Grgurich himself put it, “Every assistant coach
1;-thinksaboutlhaving his own team, it’s only natural.

houses like Iowa State, Okla-

One of Clarion-’s losses, was.
a 19-18 heartbreaker to Pac1-.

fic 8 Champ Oregon State, who
finished a whopping .f0I‘tY
points ahead of the Panther-s
at the Lehigh Quad. However,
Coach Slutzky explained the
probable reason for the. tight
Clarion-OSU score.

“Undoubtedly, Clarion has
a very good team. On any given
night they are capable of wrest-
ling with the best in the coun-
try. Nevertheless, the ’Beavers
were without two of their best
men, sidelined with skin infec-
tions suffered at Lehigh. In
addition,l,this was Oregon State’s
fifth match in a week on it
tour of the East.” _ -

Both Slutzky and Clarion As-
sistant Coach Stan Zeamer.\pre-
diet a “very exciting match.”

 At Lafayette :2

 
 

Lafayette doesn't have the repu-
tation of other Panther opponents
this season. but the Leopards
may prove surprisingly tough to-
night on their home court in Eas-
ton, Pa.

Under new head coach Tom

Davis. Lafayette has racked up an
impressive 11-2 record so far.

W0meIt’s gym
team sweeps

to easy win

The Pitt women’sgymnastics

team captured a big win over’
West Virginia Saturday morning .

by a score of 57.36-43.54.

Pitthas played and beaten West
Virginia the last two years and

this time the gymnasts took nine .

of a possible 12 places, captur-
ing firsts in all four events.

In the first event, the uneven

‘parallel bars, Pitt’s Ann Krupa

took first, West Virginia placed
second, and Donna DeMarino of

.Pitt placed third.

In vaulting, Ann Monahan cap-
tured first, DeMarino second, and
Pitt’s Kathy Krynock rounded out
the clean sweep of the event.

The balance beams followed
and DeMarino secured her sec-
ond of three firsts, with West Vir-
ginia taking second and third.

In the final event, the free ex-
ercise, it was DeMarino on top
again with teammates Donna

I Saunders and Patty Martin round-

ing out Pitt’s second clean sweep.

Coach Gail DiCicco commented,
“I’m extremely pleased with our
girls. They made a tremendous
showing."

DiCicco then singled out Krupa

for her showing, "After only two
years in gymnastics Ann Krupa
did especially well with her first
place performance on the uneven
parallel bars.”

 

 

 Panthers on road again

Though several of their victories
were over such "giants" as Mor-
avian and Muhlenberg. the Leop-
ards enjoy wins over Rutgers. La
Salle. Columbia,and West Virginia.

The Leopards and the Panthers
(8-6) have faced three common
opponents. and Lafayette holds
the edge. While Pitt lost to But-
gers by 16 points, Lafayette up-
cried the same squad by a 81-70
score last weekend.

Top scorer for Lafayette is All-
America candidate Tracy Trip-
ucka, who is currently ‘averaging
26.1 per game. Tripuckatis dan-
gerous from anywhere on the

  
   
     
   
  
  
   
   
  
  
   
     
    
  

Close behind Tripucka' is an-"
other 6-5 forward, Walt Kocubin-
ski. Besides hitting for 19 points
per game, Kocubinski leads the
squad off the boards. -

Davis’ Leopards received a set-
back in Saturday's win over Rut-
gers. Center Earl Brown at 6-10
is a doubtful starter due to an
ankle injury suffered in that con-
test. His replacement may be 6-3
Jim Portray, but the loss in height

' will be a factor.

Going into the contest, Panther
sophomore Billy Knight carries a
20.2 scoring average, with Kent
Scott not far behind at a 15.8
