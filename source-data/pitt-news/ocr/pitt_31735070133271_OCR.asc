Ringling Brothers and Barnum &

Mellon Arena. As children and parents
began lining up outside the gates, pro-

Advocates arrived. _
The" groups organized their protest
to discourage people from attending

.. is the abuse of animals used in the per-

forinances.

“The public needs to realize that
these animals are dying to entertain
us,” said Anne Lynch, a community

Friends of Animals. -

Lynch said the animals ‘ spend an
average of 48 to 50 weeks a year on the
road and are either chained or enclosed
in restrictive cages. During training
they are often whipped, shocked and
deprived of food and water. ' .

“It’s an unnatural life for them,”
Lynch said. “What are we telling chil-
dren? They are learning about man’s
cruelty.” 3

The protestors used a variety of
media to get their message across.
They handed out pamphlets, wore
signs and hung banners. They also

Pitt student arrested for
PAT graffiti helps police

ERIC LIDJI
Senior Staff Writer

A Pitt student was arrested
Thursday in connection with a grafﬁti
incident at a Port Authority Transit sta-
tion in the South Hills Village.

Bob Grove, a PAT spokesman, said
that PAT employees caught a group of
people spray-painting graffiti on light

rail vehicles around 4 a.m. on Nov. 1. »

Thomas Lawson, a 20-year-old fresh-
man engineering student, tripped while
running away and was held until police
arrived, Grove said.

According to Grove, the group van-
dalized 27 of the Authority’s 55 LRVs.
By 9 a.m., graffiti had been removed
from 19 of those 27 cars, and by 11:15
a.m., all of vehicles were clean. Grove
said because the vandals spray-painted
so many cars, PAT was forced to send
some graffiti—covered vehicles into ser-
vice that morning.

But, Grove said, PAT used discre-
tion when determining which cars were
held back.

“The cars with profanity did not
run,” Grove said. “I saw one of the cars
myself, and like a lot of graffiti I see, I

_had no idea what it said or meant.”

But Grove said that some of the
messages were more clear —— and con-
tained profanities. Those cars were
cleaned before being put into service.

Since Lawson’s arrest on Thursday, ,

three more arrests have been made.
Port. Authority police arrested
Jason Michael Kress of Pittsburgh later

in the day. He and Lawson have both .

since posted bail. .

On Nov. 2, Michael Monack, more
commonly known by his grafﬁti tag
“Mook,” which can be seen in count-
less places across the city, confessed to
a graffiti incident that occurred on
about half dozen LRVs over the week-
end of Oct. 26 and 27. Monack was
already in custody for numerous graffi-
ti incidents around the area.

On Nov. 3, police arrested Jasper
Green of Pittsburgh in connection to
the Nov. 1 vandalization.

, “The investigation is continuing,”

Grove said, “More arrests are possi '

ble.” '
All four of the men arrested have
beencharged with criminal mischief.
Because the damages caused by the
incident exceed $25,000, that charge is

SGB chooses committee chair late

ERIN BRACHLOW
Staff Writer 4

In an emergency Student Government
Board meeting late last night, the board
appointed Rogette Hanis chair of the gov-

. emmental relations committee over Brendan

Harris aftera two-week long controversy.
Because the board began yesterday’s

interviews late, it didn’t armounce the deci-

sion until 11:30 p.m. But the real beginning

_ of an “uphill battle,” according to Rogette

Hanis, started two months ago.

She applied for the position — which
entails acting as a liaison between students
and local govemment along with other

responsibilities — with several other appli— _

cants. The ﬁrst interviews took place in mid-
October and the selection comrriittee was in
charge of choosing the most qualiﬁed candi-
date for the job. The committee» included
SGB President Jeff Alex; Stephanie
Stiazisar, the committee’s former chairper-

son; board members Lonny Fish and
Michelle Agostini, and a foirner committee
member who Alex declined to name.

.. According to Fish, ﬂie selection com-
mittee members leaned toward Rogette
Harris in the ﬁrst selection process, but for
unfair reasons. After the initial interview, he
said, cormriittee members who knew her

I personally favored her based on infonnation

they’d gathered from working with her in
the past, rather than information from the
interview itself.

“There was too much subjectivity for
me to not say anything,” Fish said. .

Although he would not comment about
whether he supported another applicant over
Rogette Harris, Fish said the selection
process was not objective enough to proper-
ly evaluate all the candidates.

“Out of all the people we interviewed, I
only knew one of them, so I was objective,”

Pitt poet J -Flint -performs at last night’s Poetry Slamm sponsored by Black Action
Society. Flint came in fifth place. The winner will perform at t0night’s KRS-One concert.

Pitt student poets      
slam the competition

' JUSTIN MCCLELLAND
STAFF WRITER 0

The Kurtzman Room may have
lacked bongos or people who
snapped their fingers in lieu‘ of
applause, but the poetry still ﬂowed.

As far as competitions’ went, it
wasn’t particularly bloodthirsty, and

competitors gave each other polite «
applause as /opposed to‘ a sound

thrashing. ’ ,

But Pitt’s first Poetry Slamm, a_

poetry performance open .to all Pitt
students, provoked heated competi-
tion among Pitt’s aspiring poets.

A poetry slam is like poetry per-
formanceart. Unlike traditional read-
ings, during which poets stand
behind a podium, slammers, who
could more appropriately be consid-
ered performers, include song and
actions in their performances. »

. It’s not unusual to hear a sam-
pling of a chorus hymn or pop song
or for a poetry performer to slow and
speed his or her delivery in order to
accentuate their poems.

“I love making rhymes. It’s like
making music out of words,” said

0 Jason Flint,'who performed under the

pseudonym J-Flint. Last night’s per-
formance was Flint’s first slam-
althoug_h he compares it to being an
MC, a hobby he’s pursued in the past.-

“To be an MC you have to beta
poet and a musician,” Flint said. The
difference, he said, was that a poet

»mustluse his voice to create music.

The topics of the poetry at"

—Wednesday’s slam included love for

God, falling in love-, fear of ‘drugs and
sexism.

Performersexpressed ideas in a
variety of ways including one who
sang part of Cyndi Lauper’s mid-‘80s
hit “Time After Time.”  A i ‘

Some read from piecesof paper_ 

while others had memorized their
poems. . p

Poetry Slamm was sponsored by
Pitt’s Black Action Society and host-
ed by Davu, a veteran slammer and
member of Pittsburgh’s national
Poetry Slamm team, which finished
10th out of 30 teams in this year’s

bers gathered '-Tuesday nightat the
Jewish University Center to discuss
the Jewish claim to Israel. . ‘-
Dr. Alexander Orbach, a profes-
sor in Pitt’s religious studies depart-
ment, spoke to approximately 30 peo-

ple about the Jewish people’s tie to _ -

the land. He based his interpretation
of the Intifada conflict’ between
Arabs and Jews on historical con-
sciousness, diplomacy and national-
ism. ’ ‘
Orbach explained that many his-
torical interpretations indicate that
the Jewish people have a justifiable
claim to the land.

'He_ said that the Hebrew scrip-

tures are accepted by many Jewish

people as historically accurate, and
added that the discovery of ancient
artifacts supports the text’s events.
and teachings. I .

Orbach also spoke about the role

’ of diplomacy in the Middle East. He

feels that with responsible, intelligent
leaders, parties from each side can
reach a peaceful agreement if both
are ‘‘willing to sit down” and talk out
a negotiation.

“As a juxtaposition between the
present day and past‘ places, if it was
peaceful once, why can it not be
[peaceful] again?”'he asked.

His speech also explained the
emotional ties that Jewish people
have to Israel. He said their national-

'7-~The clash between the Arabs and
Jews may have no easy solution,‘ but

Orbach asked that everyone stake an"

interest in it because the religions of
Christians, Jews and Muslims all
focus on that part of the world.
Upon the conclusion of his
speech, Orbach addressed questions
regarding specific issues and his per-

‘sonal opinion about the conflict.
-Although he admits to not having a
formalized solution to the problem,

he says that a cease—fire must be the
first step to peace.

. Members of the audience inter-
acted with each other as well, ques-
tioning views, opinions and rational-
izations of their thoughts.

The lecture served as a memorial
to Yitzhak Rabin, -an Israeli prime
minister who was a featured player in
the peace negotiations and was assas-
sinated in 1995.

The Hillel Israel Group, which
planned the event, was started in an
effort to inform students about the
fighting in the Middle East. Serving

‘both Pitt and‘ Carnegie Mellon
' University, the‘ group was formed last

spring by Mark Shabason. ‘

Protestors target animal cruelty

Circus, page 1

Advocates called “fauna-vision” to play videos of
animals being abused by trainers. Because chil-
dren are the circus’ largest audience, the group
also passed out coloring books and stickers to
appeal to them.

Demonstrators at the circus receive varied
reactions from its attendees. Many people
become angry, even yelling at protestors, but oth-
ers are very responsive.

“Children are most receptive because of their
natural affinity for animals,” Lynch said.

Audiences are not the only ones interested in
what the groups are saying. Lynch said that last

year a trainer with the circus began yelling at the
protestors. But according to Lynch, after the
group spoke with the man, he became very
responsive, saying he was unaware of many of
the problems going on around him.

Friends of Animals and Animal Advocates
began preparing for the demonstration by sending
out press releases and newsletters to the 1,250
people on its distribution list.

The ultimate goal of the protests is to deter
people from going to circuses that use animal
acts. There are more than 20 circuses in the coun-
try that do not use animals in their shows, and
several cities have barmed circuses that use ani-
mals.

New committee chair relieved

SGB, page 1

‘he said. “And I saw that nobody was there speaking for
the other people.”

Rogette Harris disagreed with Fish, saying that the
selection committee took into account all of her accom-
plishments and experience. i

A “I have been involved in politics for a long time,”
she said. "I feel that the selection committee took all of
this into effect.”

But without unanimous board consent, the mem-
bers decided to send the decision back to the selections
committee for a second recommendation. The selections
committee returned with the same recommendation the
next week, and Fish raised the same concerns again.
Alex said such a situation was without precedent, and the
board decided it would sit in on a runoﬁ interview ses-
sion between Rogette Harris and Brendan Hanis. lllness

and family problems among board members further

delayed those interviews until yesterday.
‘This is the ﬁrst time something like this has hap-

pened,” Alex said, “and we’re handling it as best as pos- '

sible.” ,

“It’s hard to get 14 people in one room together,”
Fish said. “We wanted to do this right.” ' i

The long-standing open slot in the governmental
relations committee sparked some concern from stu-
dents, who noted at Monday"s SGB ‘meeting that with
out a- govemmental relations committee, political action
normally undertaken by SGB regarding fall elections

‘was conspicuously lacking this year.

“I think this whole situation is a shame,” Rogette
Hanis said. “An election already passed and there wer
so many things that could have been done.” '

But both Alex and Fish attributed this loss to the
change in the election cycle, rather than the delay in
choosing a committee chair. , -~

“The earliest we could have had a chair would have
been late Octo ,” Alex said, “and I’m not sure if that
even would have been enough time.” ,

Although Alex said he had to “remain neu ”
about the situation as the chair of the selection commit-
tee,‘he did recognize that the controversy has ignited
some arguments within the board.

“There will always be tension when there is differ-
ing opinions,” he said. »

Fish also said it has had an effect on the board’s rela-
tions, but he was conﬁdent all the members could over-
come it.

“We are mature enough to agree to disagree,” he
said. “That’s something that I really like about this
boar .” '

VV1th Rogette Harris ﬁnally in place at the head of
the governmental relations committee, Alex hopes all the
branches of student govemment can now work together.

“We just wanted to get the selection committee and
the board on the same page on this,” he said. “It takes
time to do things right.”

Rogette Harris is relieved that the board made a
decision and that she can start planning her agenda. .

“I’m glad it’s over after two months,” she said, “and
we can actually get started.”

Although the problem has been solved, Alex wants
_to make sure any future problems like this have prepared
solutions. . ‘

“I don’t agree with taking this much time,” he said. -

“We will be setting the protocol for future boards in case
this happens again.” ~

a felony. The suspects have also been charged with criminal
trespass and criminal conspiracy.

“I had an idea that he might be involved in something
like this,” said Brian Bucci, one of Lawson’s two room-
mates. “He kept spray paint around, he was always looking
at pictures [of graff1ti].” a

‘Police ‘arrived at Lawson’s Forbes Hall room Thursday
with a search warrant to investigate his belongings.

“They’re like, you’re going to have to get out of here,”
Bucci said. =

Bucci and Henry Pyatt, Lawson’s other roommate, went
outside while the police searched the room. Bucci said the
police split the two roommates up and questioned them sep-
arately.

Bucci was shown pictures of where Lawson was caught
and asked if he had been there. “Everyone knows the T,” he
said. ,
According to Bucci, the police brought a computer spe-

cialist with them and began searching the electronic compo-

nents of Lawson’s computer. When the search ended, he said
that the officers confiscated Lawson’s computer, his spray
paint and some photographs of graffiti.

Bucci also said that Lawson called the roommates from
the police station and asked in a roundabout way if they had
any money so that he could post bond.

The first hearing in Lawson’s case had originally been
scheduled for Nov. 5 in Upper St. Clair. It has been post-

‘’ poned until Nov. 26.

Lebanese man should remain in
jail pending investigation

Salam Ibrahim El Zaarari might have
just made a mistake. But we must all face the
consequences of even our most seemingly
innocent mistakes.

On Oct. 28, El Zaatari, a 21-year-old
former student of the Art Institute of
Pittsburgh originally from Lebanon,
attempted to board a Northwest Airlines
ﬂight bound for Detroit when his carry-on
luggage was searched. This has become typ-
ical procedure after the Sept. 11 attacks.
Authorities discovered a utility knife in his
laptop computer bag.

He has remained in jail since then on
state charges of carrying a prohibited offen-
sive weapon and federal charges of trying to
board a plane with an offensive weapon. He
had a student visa that was no longer valid
because he had dropped out of the Art
Institute. In fact, he was returning to
Lebanon the day that he was caught. U.S.
Magistrate Ila Jeanne Sensenich ordered
him held without bond because he could
pose a ﬂight risk

The knife was a utility knife — an essen-
tial tool for art students — that he had mingled
with the pens in his bag. He said that he for-
got it was in there.

One surprising aspect of this case is that
ittookasearchofhisbagatthegatetoﬁnd
the knife — it managed to get through metal
detectors and the X—ray machine.

His ﬁiends told the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette that H-Zaatari is a nonviolent per-
son, and even the prosecutors who charged
him never said he was a danger to society
when asking for his continued detention.

Attheveryleast,ElZaatariisguiltyof
making a stupid mistake. There are signs all
over the airport warning people not to try to’
take knives onto planes, and he had several
opportunities to remember his knife and dis-

_ pose of it. These signs should have jogged

his memory.

But in this time of national vigilance,
the authorities should take no risks. This case
warrants, at the least, an investigation into
whether El Zaatari has any links to terrorist
organizations. -

Since he is a ﬂight risk, he should
remain in jail until the investigation is ﬁn-
ished.

But the government should make sure
to conduct the investigation in an expedient
manner. El Zaatari should not languish in jail
for longer than necessary. The Sixth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guar-
antees the right to a speedy trial. .

In the end, the investigation may reveal
thatElZaatari was the victim ofabad com-
bination of circumstances and a stupid mis-
take. But because of the ﬂight risk, he should
at least remain in jail to assure that he shows
up for his trial.

Vague terms only confuse
specific demands, issues  

It was only a matter of time before
terms such as “historically underrepresent-
ed peoples” and “minorities” would
become troublesome language. When
drafting legislation and public policy, we

come up with cute little phrases and terms

to dance around about whom we are actu-

.happening with afﬁrrnative action today.

Few would argue it- is easy to deﬁne or

identify a particular race or culture for

such matters. In 2001, this task is about as
complicated as mastering the human
genome project. There are so many differ-
ent strands of dark-colored people that it’s

ally talking.

For black people this
will always spell danger.
When we use such vague ter-
minology, we leave the win-
dow wide open for anyone to
come and reap beneﬁts that
we try to secure for our-
selves.

This happens because blacks some-

Ireland more than potatoes, alcohol and lep

The Irish are frequently stereo-
typed as drunk, fun-loving folks
who speak with thick

besmirched the unluckiest 100 in all
of Dublin.
Irish hospitality is

brogues, wear green
every day and jabber
incessantly about all top-
ics imaginable. Six years
ago, when my family and
I took our first trip to
Ireland, we discovered’ .
that its beautiful terrain
has plenty more to offer
than just potatoes, alco-
hol and short men with

   

Mike Darling

Columnist

world-renowned. Walk
into any street comer pub
and the world’s friend-
liest lads and lasses will
greet you as if you’re
Chuchullain himself -
one of Ireland’s famous
folk heroes who, as the
story says, defeated sev-
eral formidable warriors
at the unbridled young

 

funny ears_guarding huge
pots of gold.

Still, I won’t kid you. If there is
any reason that college—age students
would love Ireland, it’s Guinness.

All across Ireland’s green
expanse, the Guinness advertising
campaign smothers the countryside
with posters strangely resembling
World War II propaganda.

Guinness is to the Irish what
McDonald’s is to Americans —
everywhere you turn, you’re faced
with the creamy white head and
thick black hue of Guinness Ale.
When a friend invites you to the pub
for a pint, you’re going to be drink-
ing Guinness.

Fittingly, one of the most practi-
cal lessons my grandfather learned
during our trip involved a pint of
Guinness and an orange. As we
relaxed in a pub one afternoon, my
grandfather leaned forward and
whispered to the entire table that
nature called and his Ex-Lax was at
the hotel. We directed him to the
bartender.

“Aw, lad, I know just the trick,”
the bartender said. He brought my
grandfather a big, ripe orange and a

pint of Guinness. “'I‘ake ‘ese and ‘ell

wash ‘ye problems right away,” he
proclaimed. Exactly one hour later,
had happily

age of seven.

If you’re lucky, they may even I

invite you out for a pub-crawl. This
is when a large group of drinkers
staggers between pubs all night,
ordering rounds of drinks at every

stop. The last man standing after this ‘

alcoholic marathon takes home his
very own pot 0’ gold. =‘

Another thing you’re likely to
encounter." is a relatively  harinleiss
looking dish called, haggis. My
fatherordered it ‘on a whim.’ Haggis
looks like a moist, gray pile "of mush
sprinkledgwith, grainy-1ool"{'iiig‘pel-
lets.,:«-.- reminiscent of pwhatdog
sometimes regurgitates after “dinner.
I’m convinced that nobody else has
ever willingly subjected himself to
the perils of this nauseating excuse
for a meal.

What is haggis,
According to the American Heritage
Dictionary, haggis is “a dish consist-
ing of a mixture of the minced heart,
lungs and liver of a sheep _or calf
mixed with suet, onions, oatmeal
and seasonings ‘and boiled in the
stomach of the slaughtered anima .”

. Yup, you read correctly. Boiled in

the stomach of the slaughtered ani-
mal. Haggis, ladies, is why men
should never again be left to do the
cooking.

The next day, I walked six ﬂights

of stairs to the top of Blarney Castle,
where the world-famous Blarney
Stone is housed. Legend has it that
kissing the Blarney Stone will grant
you the eternal gift of gab, a gift that
most of the Irish have down to a sci-

ence. What your tour guide won’t.

tell you is that kissing the stone
mandates twisting your body into
more contortions than Chasey Lane.

Once I reached the top of the
castle, a happy, bearded man with
rosy cheeks and forearms the size of
carmons stood by an open ledge. He
told me to lie down, bend, backwards
and pucker my lips.

Luckily the guy wasn’t, as I’d
thought, a random pedophile, but

A instead was there to hold my feet as

I bent back to kiss the Blarney
Stone. It’s the only way -they’l1 allow
it. Gab, after all, is a special gift. The
residents of Cork County aren’t
about to make it easy for you to get.

I’m not surprised to _read about

Ireland’s present soaring popularity.
Bill and Hillary Clinton, for exam-
ple, recently, earmarked a plush $3.1
million pad in the 1000 person town
of Kenmore, County Kerry. Even
Jackie Chan is said to be ﬁlming his

next movie, “Shanghai Knights,”

almost exclusively in Ireland. ,
Irish culture is a contrast to the

bustle of American life, making it

the perfect getaway for both celebri-

ties and the common man. Everyone,

should make it a goal to one day

share a pint with’ the Irish. -You‘

should encourage your friends and
family to do the same. ' ’

But whatever you do, don’t tell
them about the haggis.

Columnist Mike Darling will not eat

haggis in a box, he will not eat it
with a fox. He will not eat it here or
there, he will not eat it anywhere. He
hopes all ﬁne Irish lasses out there

will contact him at mfd11 @pitt.edu.

Dancing around real issues leads to unwanted results

Mock, page 6

I don’t have a problem with the term African-
American. But lately I’ve been of the opinion that unless
you’re a ﬁrst or second—generation continental African, or
unless you have been making a conscious attempt to
reconnect with long-lost_Afn'can family roots, you have
no business claiming that tag. Otherwise, every U.S. citi-
zen — black and white — is an African-American since
all of our descendants came from Africa.

African-American or not, though, black people need
to realize that we are no longer going to receive any spe-
cial treatment just because we are black. Those days are
gone. The majority community has amassed a legal army
to combat against any provision, law, amendment, policy

' . or rule that predicates itself on race.

As descendants of those who suffered U.S. govem—
ment-sanctioned slavery, legal lynchings, Jim Crow and
were barred college entrance due to skin color — among
many more injustices + we are entitled to certain provi-
sions, laws, amendments, policies and rules that correct
what was unjustly done in the past.

When you prepare any type of resolution, that dawns
from that understanding, you have to plainly state that.

It was nice that SGB’s proposed resolution 0010
asked that at least two members from “historically under-
represented groups” sit on certain committees. But that
doesn’t really say shit

If SGB truly ought to reﬂect the student body — and
let’s say black students constitute 10 percent of the school
— then logically at least one black should sit on the panel.
Hypothetically, let’s say that Asian students constitute 50

percent of the student body. They ought to have half the
seats. But in both cases it would have to be expliciﬂy stat- L

ed as such. H
When you leave it wide open using verbiage that
aspires to be politically correct, then who’s to say that two

homosexuals should not be entitled to those seats reserved H

for “minorities?”

Black people have to stop apologetically asking for '

things that rightfully are owed to us and need to start mak-
ing clear demands. Otherwise, all we are doing is seman-

tically setting ourselves up to end up right where we start-

ed in the ﬁrst place.

Brentin C. Mock aka J. Cobb aka J. Rap Brown aka

integrated is his Kaluha and cream

Show pride in Pitt, not hatred of
Penn State

I am writing in response to Brian Goldman’s
colurrm about trying to re—establish a Pitt tradi-
tion (“Time to re-establish tradition at Pitt,” Nov.
1).

As a member of the Pitt Band, the largest
student organization on campus, I feel obligated
to let the entire student body know that we do
play the Pitt victory song at every game several
times. If you arrive at the game an hour before
kick-off, you’ll hear us play it in our pregame
concert, again in our march to the stadium, in our
pregame marching show, after every touchdown
and in small sections after a big play, and if we
win, you’ll hear it again as the football team runs
over to us. »

Yes, we did take out the bridge. It was
because the student body didn’t reﬂect the kind
of attitude that should be displayed by Big East
Division I students. It wasn’t our decision, but
we stick by it. It is not our job to ridicule Penn
State. We are there to support our team and
encourage the other students all over the stadium
to do the same. I

It should not be our tradition to ridicule. Our
tradition should be to lifave; pride in our team and
our school, whether wé"re winning or losing. We
don’t have enough of it yet. In fact, most of the
student section is empty by the time the game is
over. When the pride is back, the bridge will
retum. For now, you get the abridged Pitt victo-
ry song, Hail to Pitt and the alma mater.

We must cheer for our team and not scream
the name of a school tl1at’s going to be losing
somewhere else and can’t even hear you. Don’t
think, even for a minute, that Penn State students
are yelling out our name, because they couldn’t
care less if we’re winning or losing.

The only good thing about Goldman’s col-
umn is that he printed the words to the school
ﬁght songs. Next time, he may want to include
the alma mater because the list is incomplete
without it. I urge students to continue _a tradition
of pride and excellence and learn the ﬁght songs
and alma mater. ,

Only then will they know what Marshall
Goldberg and the other Pitt greats really played
for.

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS ~ PAGE 12

    

‘Kirkley dynamic in first year of play

BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer

Early in the fourth quarter of
Pitt’s first game of its 2001 campaign.
against East Tennessee State, the first

" game ever in Heinz Field, a 19-year-

- old true freshman running back ran

into the end zone to put the Panthers
up 28-0 and seal a victory.

The‘ 5-foot-10-inch, 220-pound
running back’s name is Raymond
Kirkley Jr. Scoring a touchdown on a
college football field was far from
what Kirkley envisioned for himself
as a college freshman.

Growing up, Kirk1ey’s father was
a strong inﬂuence on him. As a child
and young adult Raymond Kirkley
Sr. played competitive basketball,
and he passed on this talent to his
son.
But Kirkley realized at a young
age that basketball wasn’t his-forte.
Instead, at the tender age of seven, he
took up the sport that would eventu-
ally lead him to Pitt. '

“I wanted to be a basketball play-
er,” Kirkley said. “I soon realized I
was too short and starting playing
football.”

Kirkley attended Madison High
School in Madison, Va. At Madison,
Kirkley got to play for one of the

‘were among the schools that wanted

most famous high school coaches in
the country, Eddie Dean. Dean
helped Kirkley become Central
Virginia’s all-time leading rusher and
scorer.

‘“[Dean] is a legendary coach,”
Kirkley said. “It was an honor to play
for him.” I V

Kirkley ran for 5,362 yards and
87 -touchdowns in his four years at
Madison. In his senior year, Kirkley
was named the state, district and
regional player of the year. With all
these prestigious numbers, _Kirkley
was destined for a big name Division
1-A college football program.

Kirkley decided to attend Fork
Union Military Academy after gradu-
ating high school. It was a chance for
him to fine-tune his work and study
habits while keeping his football
career moving forward. In one year
of football at Fork Union, Kirkley ran
for 800 yards and seven touchdowns.
Many big name college football pro- .
grams began recruiting him.

Bowling sees first action of season

NATALIE KRASMAN
Staff Writer

Pitt’s bowling team had an unsatis-
factory performance last weekend as it
traveled to Kent State University to _
play in the Kent State invitational.

“We sucked horribly,” men’s team
captain Beau Dunkerly summarized.

With a knockdown of 9,379 total
pins and a 919 average out of 10 games,
the Panthers finished 20th out of the 22

_teams.
Toledo and Oberlin were the only

bowling.

than Pitt. 1

The Panthers’ poor performance
could be attributed to an incomplete
roster. The women’s team did not
attend, and three of Pitt’s best male
members could not make the trip, forc-

ing the team to take a smaller roster
with a female bowler to stand in as a
male replacement.

Kristen Reichenbach, who was the
only female bowler representing the
Panthers, accompanied veteran senior
bowlers Dave
Maloney and Dunkerly. The three men
have several years experience compet-
ing in tournaments, but freshman Matt
Leilous saw his first action in collegiate

“All and all I wasn’t totally disap-
pointed under the circumstances, but
we could have done a lot better,”
Dunkerly said.

The top average in the men’s divi-
sion was 254, and out of 126 male con-
testants, Maloney averaged the highest
of Pitt’s male competitors.

He finished 30th, knocking down

Goldman took the 66th position
with Pitt’s third top score, averaging

The Saginaw Valley Cardinals, who
averaged l,130'in 10 games and placed
in the top three spots for individual
men’s averages, won the tournament. \

_ The Panthers travel this weekend
for a tournament at Penn State, and
Dunkerly is excited about Pitt’s chances
at this invitational.

— our women’s team will also be traveling
with us and they have a good chance of
placing first,” Dunkerly said.

Pitt, ‘Cusewill roll easily over lowly opponents

Another stellar turnout for my compulsive comer
last week as I ran away with another 4-1 record.

I definitely fouled up on the Pitt pick but
Nebraska and the three Florida teams came through
big. Nebraska had no trouble smashing Kansas, and
South Florida, Florida State and Central Florida cov-
ered their games easily.

My record is now 24-13-1. You can make your
checks payable to The Dutch Master.

I've got four picks for you this week.

Pitt at Rutgers (-19)

For weeks I’ve said that I would not pick Pitt until
the team showed that it could execute on a consistent
basis and there is no doubt in my mind that they

proved themselves. This team is ﬁnally a unit, playing '

as one.

What can you really say about Rutgers?

This is a team that lost by 25 points to Temple, 16
points to Buffalo and was shut out by Virginia Tech,
50-0. Oh yeah, they also gave up 80 points last week
to West Virginia.

No, that’s not a typo. 

' Granted, he’s only a freshman, Rutgers quarter-
back Ryan Cubit is horrible. He’s thrown 17 intercep-
tions this season and just eight touchdowns, including
four picks last week against West Virginia. He com-
pleted just four of 14 passes last week for a whopping
27 yards.

Pitt’s defense beat the crap out of teams in the last
two games and I kind of feel bad for Rutgers this
week. One can easily see Pitt taking out all of its pent-
up stress from earlier in the season and releasing its
anger on the opposing team with no remorse.

The Pitt defense gave up a total of -2 net rushing
yards in the last two games, yielding just 14 points.
Rutgers carried the ball 57 times last week. I

I’m pretty confident that this one’s going to get
ugly.

Hey guys, women can

know about sports too

Column, page 12

that women can’t be knowledgeable about
sports? Why do they feel the need to bash us
for absolutely no reason? A reader may not
agree with what I say and that’s ﬁne, but to
tell me I’m stupid is another matter.

I’ve come tothe conclusion that men
feel the need to act in such a manner because
they feel threatened by women They are
insecure enough that they need to drive us
out because they cannot admit that sports are
a “girl ' g” too.

I’ve spent my entire life surrounded by
sports, not only watching but also playing
and attending games of family members as
well. It’s in my blood, so it’s only natural that
I know a thing or two. Sure, I’m still a girl
who wears skirts and frets about my hair, but
that doesn’t mean I’m an idiot.

View us as fellow sports lovers ‘rather than an-
enemy. You might ﬁnd that we actually

know what we’re talking about, and you _

might even learn a thing or two.

rm really not a mean person and I’m
not trying to come across that way. I’m just
tired of having to struggle, urmecessarily to
do my job. But in a weird way, I’m thankful
for the challenge.

Facing adversity has made me an even
stronger person and has led me to push
myself even harder. When people tell me
that I can’t do something or don’t belong
somewhere, I’m just that much more deter-
mined to succeed. .

And so, I’m set on going out and kick-
ing butt, making my writing the best itcanbe
and proving to everyone that I indeed belong
as a sports writer.

I expect a number of letters to the editor
and e—mails in response to this column, and
all I can say is bring ‘em on. Your demoral-

' izing words may sting for a minute, but at

least I know there are people out there who
not only take the time to read my writing, but
respond to it

I know I can’t change the way people
think and it would be naive to believe I can.
But for all of the men out there who believe
that sports are not for women, you better
drop your macho man attitude and learn to
accept reality.

So guys, how’s your casserole?

for college.”
Only one school would win the
battle for Kirkley, and like the saying

goes, Pitt was it. With the graduation “

of both Pitt running backs Kevan
Barlow and Nick Goings after the
2000 season, Kirkley knew he would

get a .chance "to play his freshman

year at Pitt.

When Kirkley arrived to fall
camp two weeks before the scheduled
first game of the season in 2001, he
found himself in a heated battle with
six other new Pitt running backs for
the starting job. ‘Only one of the
seven was older than a freshman.

“Pitt said I could play early as a
freshman,” Kirkley said. “So I took
advantage of it.” I

Kirkley impressed running backs
coach Shawn Simms with his work
ethic and determination. At the sec-
ond scrimmage, Kirkley broke away
from the rest of the pack. He was

named the starting running back by .

head coach Walt Harris for the
Panthers when they opened up Heinz
Field Sept. 1. ' -
“Ray is a delightful man,” Harris
said. “He has been learning a lot and
not -fumbling the ball. He has been a
real pleasant addition to the team.”
On Sept. .1, Kirkley became only
the third true freshman in school his-
tory to start in a season—opening
game. One of those true freshman
starts was running back Tony Dorsett.
“He had a purpose,” Simms said.

‘5He’s young and he’s learning. His

maturity level is much higher than
others. His work ethic is outstanding.
If you don’t have to coach that into a
player it makes coaching easier.”

Not only did Kirkley break barri-I

ers as a true freshman starter, he also
became the first Pitt running back to
play in Heinz Field. Kirkley took full
advantage of his opportunity to play
by dazzling the 47,919 fans with his
gut—wrenching style of ‘running. He
quickly became known as a power
back that would bulldpze potential
tackles. Kirkley ended the first game
of the season with 18 carries for 90
yards and a touchdown.

. “It was overwhelming the first
half,” Kirkley recalled. “Then I real-
ized I’m a college player like every-S

one else. It’s a challenge, and I’m_

always up for a challenge.”

‘Kirkley has made a name for
himself on the football field for years
to come, but off the field, Kirkley
isn’t as explosive.

Between playing video - games
like Madden 2002 on PlayStation 2,
Kirkley talks online to his friends
from Virginia. Kirkley always has a
smile on his face and is very shy. He
has a mellow voice that sounds as
soft as a radio DJ ’s, but he has a heart

is‘ here to play football" and have fun.

“The players all liked him from
the beginning,” Simms‘ said. “They
knew he.Was for real.”

Ever wonder about the football
history between Pitt and Rutgers?
