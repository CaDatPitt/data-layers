revealed at SC] B meeting

By Stephanie Myers
Staff Writer 1

Construction will begin on a
new 500-bed dormitory in ap-
proximately one year, according
to Student Government Board
President Kent Baldauf.

Baldauf said that he attended

 the Student Affairs Board of

Trustees meeting where Dr. Wes-
ley Posvar stated that such a dor-
mitory was a main concern to
students. ~

The board is considering the
idea to begin afreshman appren-
tice program. Board member Elis-
sa Klein felt the idea- would
benefit students bygiving more
of an awareness of the board's ac-

' . tivities.

Student government already
has a freshman council, but it is
only engaged in specific projects.

"The idea of getting a student to '

be an apprentice and receiving
first-hand knowledge alleviates
the problems of a new board
coming in without experience,”
said Klein.

Klein also said that an appren-

. tice program would promote the

   

 continuation of existing
programs. . .
the program is at

At. this time,-

    

an informal stage, and the board
is interviewing interested
students.

The apprentices, according to l

Klein, would have active partici-
pation and would be involved in
board activities. "They are going
to help us as much as we are go-

ing to help them,” said Klein.

The apprentice program was
initiated because many freshmen
applied for chair positions. Klein
said, "lt’s not necessarily the
place for a freshman to be in a
chair position because they don't

have a real understanding of what D

goes on. They‘ haven't had
enough of a chance to get in-
valved."

Klein said that, hopefully, this
program will strengthen the
board and give people a better
understanding of student
government. _

In other business, Anastasia
Kawalek and Klein spoke with
Dr. John Vrana about a point-
system meal plan. According to

. Kawalek, Vrana said the meal

plan Pitt now has is the most effi-
cient for the university.

Four Pitt researchers work-
ing through the‘Western Psy-
chiatric lnstitute and Clinic
will stage a pilot study on the
effects of stress on the cardi-
ovascular system. .

'’If this pilot study is a suc
cess, it can be used on a large
scale, in epidemiological

' studies on the relationship be-
tween stress‘ response and
coronary heart disease,” said
Dr. Tom Kamarck, ' assistant
professor of psychology and
psychiatry at the "university
and one of the project's co-
investigators. I

Epidemiology is the study of
the occurrence, spread and
control of diseases within—_a
population.

”Some' people are high
responders to stress they en-
counter over their daily rou-
tine,” said Kamarck. "We
want to find these-people, see
if we can detect individual
differences’ in their cardio-
vascular responses [those in-
volving the heart and blood
vessels] to behavioral tasks,
and see whether these cardi-

ovascular patterns are constant ,

over time."
Volunteers“ are needed ’,fQl'

age groups: 25-44 and 55-64
years of age. .

"We’re particularly interest-
ed in the 55-64 group, the
hardest one to recruit,” said
Kamarck, "so we especially
encourage alumnae, relatives
of Pitt News readers and
professors to participate."

Volunteers should also have
no history of high blood pres-
sure, heart disease, diabetes,
hormonal ‘imbalances, or
metabolic problems, said
Kamarck. ‘ _

The laboratory for testing is
on the 13th floor of WPIC and
is designed to measure sub-
jects’ heart rate, blood pres-
sure and blood flow. The two
sessions will each last about
two to three hours and will be
scheduled two weeks apart.

Volunteers will be compen-
sated $5 to $8 hourly, depend-
ing on how well they perform
assigned tasks (video games
designed by the research
team, which is headed by Dr.
J. Richard Jennings, principal
investigator for the project).

The National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institution offered
to fund researchers who

would conduct the studywith .

a cooperative agreement, a
type of grant stipulating close.

Along with another team in

Pilot studies on males «in by

Baker begins missile talks with West Germany

BON N, West Germany (AP) —
Secretary of State James A. Baker
Ill on Sunday opened critical talks
with West German leaders who
have balked at a North Atlantic
Treaty Organization plan to up-
grade short-range nuclear mis-
siles in Europe.

I NEWS BRIEFS

Baker flew in from London af-
ter sessions with British leaders
and immediately met with For-
eign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, a strong advocate of
reducing nuclear tensions in
Europe.

Baker, on a six-day trip to visit
the 15 NATO allies, told report-
ers during the flight he was not
worried about West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s state-
ment last week that the Lance
missiles now deployed are ade-
quate until 1995.

Under the proposal before
NATO, the current 70-mile range
would be extended with new

V rockets that could hit targets
about 320 miles away.

’’I think what we need to do is
to find out exactly what the Ger-

man government's position is go-
ing to be,” Baker told reporters.

Genscher, greeting Baker at
rain—swept Bonn-Cologne airport,
pledged to ”work cooperatively
together.”

Commenting on his meetings
earlier Sunday with Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher of Bri-
tain and Sir Geoffrey Howe, the
foreign secretary, Baker said he
received support on many NATO
issues.

Hospital files suit in
discharge dispute

(AP) — A Pittsburgh hospital
has filed suit to evict a 70-year-
old patient who refuses to be dis-
charged in a dispute over
whether she needs medical atten-
tion after more than 13 months
there.

’’I have serious questions ‘about
the way they are handling this
discharge,” Joseph Olimpi,

manager of the Elderly Law
Project of Neighborhood Legal
Services, said of West Penn
Hospital.

’’I don't think anybody can ord-

er her to go anyplace she doesn't
want to go since she has been
judged competent,” he said.

Olimpi told the hospital he will
represent the patient, Eleanor
Cosentino, in the dispute.

West Penn's lawsuit, filed Fri-
day in Allegheny County Court,
claims Miss Cosentino no longer
needs medical attention, hospital
attorney Jerry Fedele said. The
hospital is trying to force her to
be transferred to a county nurs-
ing home, her home, or to a rela-
tive’s home.

Death rate of blacks
high in local area

(AP) — Black residents of Al-
legheny County have a 50 per-
cent higher death rate than white
residents, according to a study.

The disparity holds true for ev-
ery major disease in nearly all age
groups.

Virtually all non—vio|ent deaths
among black adults younger than
45 could be prevented by avoid-
ing cigarettes and alcohol, mak-
ing dietary changes and seeking
treatment forcommon co,n_d_i_tions

such as hypertension, Dr. Lewis
Kuller told The Pittsburgh Press.
Kuller, chairman of epidemiol-
ogy at the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Graduate School of
Public Health, headed the study
examining 15,700 death certifi-
cates from 1987 for the Alleghe-
ny County Health Department.

Food bank may have
to close soon in Pgh.

(AP) — A group that helps feed
the jobless says its monthly giv-
eaway to 200 or more families is
in jeopardy because the building‘
where it stores and distributes
groceries is the subject of a labor
union struggle. .

On one side of the dispute is
Darrell Becker, former president
of Shipbuilders Local 61, and his
supporters. They are opposed by
the union's international officials,
who claim they own the Local 61
hall on Neville Island and last
week changed the locks on the
building. ‘

Baby boom...

Students balance college with family

By Mark Staf

The Pitt News

Pitt sophomores Michael and
Nicolle Seperack have had to
grow up more rapidly than most
college students. ‘

They don't socialize at bars, at-
tend basketball games or throw
wild parties. Spending money on
junk food and beer, joining a
fraternity or sorority or vacation-
ing in Daytona Beach is not pos-
sible for them. They've chosen a
different lifestyle.

in addition to being full-time
Pitt students, Michael and Nicolle
are married and parents of a
blond-haired, blue-eyed baby girl
— Brittany.

Nicolle, age 19, and Michael

Seperack, 21, have been married
one year and live in Squirrel Hill
with their 10-month-old baby.
There's no doubt that they love
her very much. However, Britta-
ny requires a great deal of time
and attention, and many times
makes studying more difficult
than it already is.

Michael attends classes in the
morning and afternoon, while
Nicolle spends time with Britta-
ny and her class-work. Then, in
the evening, Nicolle attends
classes while Michael attempts
the task of studying, making din-
ner and watching the baby.

- Nicolle relates that ”it’s hard-
er than I can tell you.”

’’If I'm with Brittany and my
books for an hour, I'll get a about
a half-hour of studying done. The

normal things take on new mean-
ing. Going to the bookstore is
almost impossible. And things
like standing in line for an hour
to register for classes or some-
thing becomes much more taxing
and upsets you even more when
you're holding a child.”

Michael and Nicolle both
agree that their social life is often
sacrificed for parental responsi-
bilities.

Michael says, ”Going out is out
of the question. We don't go out
at all. A babysitter is out of our
budget.”

Nicolle adds, ’’I can't go out
with my friends like other stu-
dents. I have to be home at eight
o'clock to put Brittany to sleep.
It's hard to go out at night at all

because it's so difficult to get a

We see how easy most other students have it, and that gets tough. For
us, even normal things take on new meaning.

-- Michael Seperack

rest of the time, I'm looking after
her,” says Michael, an English
and computer science major.

Nicolle, a history major, adds,
’’I can't put her down when I'm
studying because she will be into
everything. She has ruined more
books than I can afford.”

Nicolle admits that she's just
happy to be studying at all. For
a while, she‘ wondered if she
would be able to attend college
immediately following Brittany’s
birth.

’’I wasn't too sure if I was go-
ing to be able to make it back to
school,” she says. ’’I sure didn't
know how hard it was going to
be.

”|t’s more than the studying
that is tough. The tough part is en-
during some of the sacrifices that
l have. to make. I can't be like
other college students. They can
come and go as they please. -I
have to take Brittany with me
everywhere I go,” Nicolle says.

Michael adds, ”We see how
easy most other students have it,
and that gets tough. For us, even

babysitter, I have a hard time
trusting babysitters.”
Unfortunately, alhired babysit-
ter would be the only person who
would be able to care for Britta-
ny. Nicolle and Michael are both
from Syracuse, N.Y., and have no

family in Pittsburgh at all. They

also say that they haveno close"
friends with whom they would
feel comfortable leaving Brittany.

There are other sacrifices that
the two have to make. The -cost
of Brittany’s clothes, food and
medicine prevents Michael and
Nicolle from buying new cloth-
ing and luxuries for themselves.

Since,Michael and Nicolle are
not eligible to receive any welfare
money or food stamps, they are
forced to get by on the little
money that Michael makes from
a work‘study program, past sav-
ings and tight budgeting.

Prior to Brittany’s birth, Nicolle
was a straight—A student in high
school, planned on attending
Harvard University, and had a
good “chance of attaining a

scholarship. Michael was a stu-
dent at Carnegie Mellon
University.

At the age of 17, Nicolle be-
came pregnant. Although both
her and Michael's parents ad-
vised against it, she and Michael
agreed to have the child and face
the challanges of parenthood.

”Both of our parents freaked
when we told them,” Michael
says. ”Many suggested that we
have an abortion. It's not what we
wanted.”

Nicolle continues, ”There was
a lot of disappointment. Harvard
was always my dream. With a
child, I knew that there was no
way that I could do it.”

Since Michael was already liv-
ing in Pittsburgh, Nicolle and
Michael decided to raise Brittany
in Pittsburgh, where they would
both attend Pitt.

”Since I had already been here
and we knew and liked the area,

_   _ A __ . we thought that it would be a

afford CMU anymore, but I

honestly admit that llike Pitt bet-
ter anyway."

The two had previously plan-
ned to enroll Brittany in Pitt's
Child Development Center. Un-
fortunately, there is an approxi-
mate year-long waiting list to
enter a 10-month—old child into
this program, and the department
does not provide special
privileges for Pitt students or em-
ployees. Also, since the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh does not fund
this department, the cost of en-
rollment for the program is close
to $300 a month —— an unafford-
able cost for Michael and
Nicolle.

Even though Brittany is well-
behaved, the responsibility of
having to take care of her all day
and night wears Michael and
Nicolle Pdown tremendously.

Michael notes, ”We have pret-
ty much gotten used to it. No
doubt it's tough, but we have
learned to accept it.”

Nicolle adds, ”I’m generally
pretty happy. I love Brittany and
wouldn't trade her for the world.
I just wish that things .didn’t have
to happen this way. I sure don't
recommend this to other
students.”

Michael and Nicolle still manage enough energy to play with the baby. .

Swim teams take 7th straight Big East crown

By Chris Bosak
Staff Writer

0 Swimmer of the meet.

0 Diver of the meet.

0 Coach of the meet.

0 The nearest competitor over
250 points behind.

This explains the domination
the Pitt women's swim team
showed this weekend in the Big
East Championship meet.

The victory marked the seventh
consecutive year Pitt has won the
meet. They easily outdistanced
second—p|ace Villanova 845-581.
Boston College was third with
513 points, followed by Syracuse
(486), Providence" (347), St.
John's (271), Connecticutt (223),
Georgetown (216), and Seton
Hall (95).

I Pitt coach David Belowich
earned coach of the meet honors
for the seventh consecutive year.

”The bottom line is they stayed
by the same philosophy as they
[have]' from the beginning — to
be the best that you can be,” said

elowich. ”And today they were
the best they could be. I'm very,
very pleased.”

Freshman, Laura Lee Sullivan,
was pleased with her perfor-
mances this weekend. She
earned swimmer .of the meet
honors, set a new meet record,
and was part of four Pitt victories.

Her time of 1:04.85‘ in the 100
breaststroke, broke the old meet

“&cord set "by;Tara‘ McKenna in

1986. _ '

She. also won the 200 Individu-
al Med_Iey, the 200 breaststroke,
and teamed with Sandy Albright,

Noell_e'-Barry, and Laure Walczak-
‘ to win the 200 Medley relay race.

”I’m very happy. I wasn't con-
centrating on beingswimmer of
.the meet," said Sullivan, ”I just
wanted to swim as well as I
Qould.” ’
Senior diver, Margie Paulick,
was named diver of the meet for
the third time in her career. She

won the 3-meter competition,.

and was second, behind team-
mate Krissa Ratliff, on the 1-meter
board.

”I thought I had a really good
meet,”said Paulick. ”I was real-
ly consistent. It's nice to end that
way.” ,

Pitt diving coach, Julian Krug,
who added a victory celebration
dive of his own off the 10-meter

gboard (dressed in street clothes),

added, ”I have to be very happy
with Margie. I'm also very hap-
py with all the girls.”

Ratliff added a second place
‘finish on the 3-meter board, and

freshman Mindy Hennon took,

fourth in the 1—meter compe-
tition. .
Walczak also turned in an out-
standing performance for Pitt. She
dominated the short freestyle
' vents including victories in the
‘S0 and 100 freestyle races. She
‘ teamed with Celeste Makiel,
Tricia Rickert, and Christine Gal-
lagher to add Pitt victories in the
200 and 400 freestyle relay
events.
Makiel was also victorious in
the 500 freestyle competition.

lMa tthews’ big day pushes Panthers
past second ranked Georgetown

By Vince Carey

-» - Sports Editor

One more time.

Coming off two demoralizing
losses to Providence (88-78) and
Syracuse (103-80), the Pitt Pan-
thers got ready to play their fourth
top—10 team of the season‘ (hav-
ing already beaten then-No. 2
Syracuse, 81-76, then-No. 3 Ok-
lahoma, 99-91, and then-No. 9
Seton Hall, 82-79) in
Georgetown.

”[Pitt Coach Paul Evans] gave

us a real tough time in practice.

Thursday,” fon/vard Rod Brookin
said. ”It was the toughest practice
that we have had all season.”
Well, whatever Evans did to
the team on Thursday, it _worked.
The Panthers played one"of their

4

  

best games of the season to defeat
No. 2 Georgetown, 79-74.

”I may never be nice to them
again,” Evans said. ”I thought we

had a good effort out of'all six ‘

kids, which is what we have been
saying all year -— that's what it
takes for us to beat anybody. The

_intensity was a whole lot better

than it had been the last two
games." -
That intensity was there early
on as Pi,tt"showed that it would
not be intimidated by’ Georg-
town’s taller front line, unlike the
first matchup between these
teams (a 76-57 Hoya victory).
They took it straight to the hole

and played nip-and-tuck with_

Georgetown for the first 15
minutes.
Guard Jason Matthews, who

 
 
  
  
  

paced Pitt with 24 points, got the
Panthers started with a two"th'ree-'
pointers in the first three minutes
to put his team up’8-4.

”When I came out of warm-
ups, I felt really good,” said Mat-
thews, who shot five of six from
the three-point line. ”My team-
mates helped out a lot by getting
me the.” ball and setting the
picks.”

The Hoyas took their first lead

 of the game, 14-10, when center
Alonzo Mourning put down a
power slam, and guard Charles 7

Smith nailed a three-pointer at the
15-minute mark. ,

Thelead went from four to two
and then from three to one before

baseline to put the Panthers back

The Pitt men's swimming team
suffered an early scare this
weekend, falling behind for the
first time ever at the Big East
Championships. But they slowly
clawed back into first place,
eventually winning by 50 points
(the Panthers’ seventh straight Big
East championship) over second
place Villanova, 849.5-794.5, the
closest meet in seven years.

Men's swimming coach Dick
Bradshaw did not shave or rest
most of his swimmers, leaving
room for the other teams to fight

for a victory. Bradshaw did not

rest his team for the Big East-.th~is
year because he felt secure that
his team could win unshaved and

because he wanted to save his _

swimmers for their next meet, the

Eastern Seaboard Championships .
next month, which will have .a‘

higher level of competition‘ a
”This team did something

they’ve.never done before. One

is to come from behind after the

second day and the other is to set V »

their goals for something higher
than this,” said Bradshaw.

”One of the things that,we’re

trying to do in our programis to

direct people more towards the V ’

NCAA Championships. We have
the caliber of swimmer that we

should be doing that. As a result .

The 15th-ranked Pitt wrestling

team narrowly missed upsetting
No. 3 Penn State Saturday night,

-but wound up losing 25-18.

Pitt led the Nittany Lions,
18-17, with only two matches to
go. However, both 190-pound
Perry Miller and heavyweight
John Owens lost their matches by
decision and allowed PSU to seal
the victory, the Lion's 50th con-
secutive Eastern Wrestling
League triumph.

On paper, the stronger Penn
State lineup was supposed to
blow Pitt out; but PSU head
coach Rich Lorenzo was happy to
come out of Fitzgerald Field
House with a win.

’’I knew Pitt would come out
and really come after us. I really
like wrestling them. I was hoping
it wasn't going to be this close,
but then I really started hoping
we were going to get out of here
with a win,” Lorenzo said.

tough this _Eastern Wrestling

Pitt started the match with a pin
from 1 18-pounder Bob Simpson.
Simpson continues to start the
Panthers off on the right foot —
he has pinned his opponents
three times this season.

’’I knew the team really need-

pened before,” Bevilacqua said.

”Scott felt pretty slick out there;
he was moving laterally very
well. He got some nice shots in
on me, and things just didn't turn
out for the best.”

The momentum shifted the
wrong way for Pitt in the
167—pound division. All was go-
ing well for Pitt until Panther
sophomore Nick Damico, who
had control of his match with sec-
ond-place EWL finisher Jason
Suter, turned onto his back and
wound up putting his team down
by two as Suter pinned him

158-pound wrestler who was
wrestling at 167, so he was a lit-
tle out of his weight class.

”He just got caught; he made
a big mistake. That hurt — that

. hurt big time.”

After Damico’s match, Pitt's
Lance Markel took on Matt White
at 177. Markel was down 8-4
with 10 seconds to go in the
match. Within those 10 seconds,
as White was controlling from the
top position, Markel pulled a
reverse and nearly pinned White.
Markel came out with five quick
points, which were enough to
postihim as the winner at 9-8.

by a lot of points,” Markel said.
Somehow, that exciting win
just didn't seem to get the Pan-

thers back into the swing of _

things, mostly because Pitt had
expired its middle lineup strength
and had only the two heavy-
weight divisions to go.

Perry Miller, who has been I

slightly inconsistent this season,
took on an obviously stronger, al-
beit shorter, Andy Voit. Voit to-
tally dominated the match and
wound up with a 16-7 major de-
cision.

Pitt had a chance to tie it go-
ing into the heavyweight bout,

  

 

easily. ’’I knew I had to do something, but eighth—ranked Panther John

”I think every one thought that
since we didn't have any diving
today, Villanova would have a
shot. I told our guys that Villano-
va would say ‘with no diving
now we'll be able to beat Pitt’ but
our guys came through,” said
Bradshaw.

Dave Schepner won’ the
1650m free and Mike Pfister
finished second to extend the
Panther lead‘ for good.

”You have to hand it to Pitt,”
Georgetown Coach John Thomp-
son said. ”They never really let
us get into our game, and they
hung with us all the way through.
Like I told the players, all we last
was a game, not the whole
season.”

The Panthers put their lead up
to four, 26-22, but then the Hoyas
took over the game. It started in-
nocently enough, with a Smith
jump shot after a Hoya timeout,
but five minutes later, George-
town was up by 10.

”We did everything right dur-
ing the last five minutes of the first
half,’’ Thompson said. ”We
made our shots and played our
game.”

scored 15 points and had seven

THE PITT NEWS, -Monday, February 13, 1989

rebounds, picked up three quick
fouls during the run, and Pitt
looked to be out of it.

”We couldn't give up when we
got down in this game,” Mat-
thews said. ”We put too much
work into this game just to give
up.II

Pitt tried to come back a little
at the end of the half, but still
went into the locker room down
44-36.

”We needed somebody to go
out and do something,” Evans

‘said. ”They couldn't just [lie]

down and die like nobody was
going to care about it.”

Shorter hit one of two free
throws to start the second half,
but ‘Georgetown continued to
roll. They stretched their lead to
12 points, 49-3 7, on a Mourning
sky hook before Pitt could do
much. Then ' something
happened.

Mourning picked up two fouls
within 10 seconds, and the Pan-
thers saw their chance. Matthews

— drove in for a_ layup and then took

an outside shot to cut the lead to
five points.

”We learned from our early
mistakes,” said Bobby Martin,
who had 16 points and a game-
high 11 rebounds.

When Jaren Jackson hit a three-
pointer at the 14-minute mark,
the lead was back to 10, and
Georgetown looked as if they

‘would pull away.

But Pitt continued to match the
Hoyas basket for basket, and the
lead rotated between eight and

10 points.

That was until the nine—minute
mark when Rod Brookin started
making his shots. First he hit a
three-pointer to get Pitt rolling.
Then, a minute later, Mourning
picked up his fifth foul, and Pitt's
eyes widened.

”At that point, Bobby could
stay down low a little more, and
we were able to pick up a cou-
ple charges on their guards,”
Evans said. ”I think the loss of
Mourning hurt them more than it
helped us. Their inside game vir-
tually disappeared.”

Matthews cut the lead to six by
hitting a free throw, then Brookin
connected on another trey to pull
Pitt within just three points.

”Once we started going, we
knew we could win the game,”
Sean Miller said. ”It just took a lit-
tle while.”

Pitt made it all the way back

when Matthews sunk two from
the charity stripe and hit a three-
pointer to put the Panthers up by
one. _ , .
”That shot was supposed to go
into Brian, but he was covered,”.
Matthews said. ”Then [Dikembe]
Mutombo started backing up a lit-
tle bit, and I hit the shot.”

It was Georgetown’s turn to be
stunned. They tied the game at 70
on a Mark Tillmon layup, but Pitt
came right back. They stretched
their lead to seven with six sec-
onds left when Shorter sunk a free

9

throw. Smith put in an uncontest- *

ed layup at the buzzer and Pitt
had won, 79-74.
