SGB members bid farewell McKinley

By Kevin Kramer
Staff Writer

Pitt’s Student Government Board members
said their goodbye’s to one another at last
night’s final SGB meeting. Though President
Ross Pasquale and other members were sad-
dened by the finale of their terms, they were
very enthusiastic about the accomplishments
of the 1994 SGB.

“It/ appears to me this has been the best
SGB that has been around for ten or fifteen
years,” said Pasquale. “I’m very pleased with
the board, and I hope they can set a standard
for future boards.”

SGB President-Elect Julie Crowell agreed
with Pasquale on the accomplishments of the
board.

“This year’s board has been exceptional,”

said Crowell. “We’ve changed this office

into an office that can be taken seriously.”
Crowell said her task as next year’s presi-

dent will be difficult without her comrades

on this year’s board but feels hopeful about‘

next year.

“I am hopeful to work with the new board
members and try to live up to, and even suc-
ceed, this year’s board,” said Crowell.

Among the student issues to which Crowell
said she plans to attend next year is the
establishment of a better dialogue with the
university community and with student
groups.

“We’1l be doing a lot of experimentation to
reach out to as many students,” she said.
“We will engage in more publicity for our
meetings and open forums.”

stands for
equality

By Stephanie Wright
Staff Writer

As a student leader, Eric
McKinley said he strives to
ensure a level playing ﬁeld for
all students and he considers
himself on that same level.

At the 1994 Student
Government Board inaugural
dinner, all nine newly elected
members were sitting on a
stage above the crowd of par-

ents and students. McKinley

All in a day's work...

said he felt so uncomfortable
looking down at everyone on
the ﬂoor that he took his plate
and joined them.

McKinley’s involvement
seems to reflect his compas-
sion for people.

‘‘I’m a staunch advocate for
fair play and equality for all,”
said McKinley. ‘

These are not just words for
McKinley, who is the only
African-American on SGB.

He is also a member of the
University Senate committee
for anti-discrimination policies,
a cultural diversity facilitator
for the New Student Programs
office and a member of the
pre—law society for minority
students.

“What I’d like to see more
than anything else is the inclu-
sion of every type of student
on this campus.”

“You can be intimidated by
Pitt if you are not in the major-
ity,” said McKinley. He said
that he speaks of all minorities,
whether it’s race, gender, reli-
gious beliefs or sexual prefer-

Placement center helps stuclents lincl jobs

By Mark Gordon
and John B. Moore
The Pitt News

Diploma in hand, a mass of graduating
seniors prepares to step out into the post-co1-
lege world and battle the unexpected while
looking for employment. But with the help
of the University Placement Center, students
no longer have to face the responsibility
alone.

Located on the second ﬂoor of the William
Pitt Union, the placement center offers job-
hunting skills, advice and counselling and
matches students with prospective recruiters.

While it has been around for nearly 50
years, the most drastic changes have taken
place in the last four or ﬁve years, according
to Placement Center Director Bob Perkoski.

‘The marketplace has changed,” Perkoski
said. “How people get hired is not the
same.”

According to Perkoski, companies are
much more diverse today in their hiring
practices. That is where the Placement
Center comes in.

Perkoski said that if a prospective employ-
er would call him on a Monday, by Tuesday
the employer would have the resumes of Pitt
students that match the company’s needs.

One goal of Perkoski’s is to make Pitt stu-
dents more competitive in the job market.

“Because you’re competing against other
schools, you’re competing against a whole
myriad of factors,” Perkoski said. “You
become competitive by knowing how com-
panies hire,” Perkoski said.

He said the counselors, or “portfolio man-
agers,” at the placement center are trained in
marketing, in knowing companies’ hiring
policies. The counselors are also responsible
for training students on resume writing and
then matching up students with jobs.

“This is not a one—contact ofﬁce where

you walk in, make one contact and then go
home,” Perkoski said.

The center has been very successful in
finding jobs for students, according to
Perkoski.

“We’ve done well,” he said. “Last year
35% of the people that did ﬁnd jobs found
them as a result of our direct services.”

Perkoski said new computer systems have
given the placement service an opportunity
to respond to a business inquiry in one day.

He said that one of the systems is called
Alum-Net, a computerized program that
helps students get in contact with Pitt alum-

ni. There is also a resume referral system __

that was developed to connect prospective
employers with graduating seniors in a mini-
mal amount of time.

“We’re trying to be more sensitive to com-
panies and their needs,” Perkoski said.
“We’re also trying to be more sensitive to
students and what they want.”

LONDON — The first Beatles
album to be released in almost
25 years soared to number one
in the British charts Monday
after only four days on sale.

“Live at the BBC,” 56 songs
recorded by the Fab Four for
radio shows between 1962 and
1965, has been digitally remas-
tered by Beatles producer
George Martin.

British media reported the
album had sold 200,000 copies
in four days, but EMI record
Company could not confirm
this.

The album, containing some
of the band’s own hits, has
attracted ﬂocks of buyers in
British record stores. It does not
go on sale in the United States
until Tuesday, EMI said. —

Set aside time to exercise

By Julie D. Hannon
For The Pitt News

Students are no longer strict-
ly interested in preparing to
climb the corporate ladder.
Stairrnasters, bicycles and aer-
obics have become more than
just fads here in Oakland.

Students are preparing them-
selves physically as well as
mentally to enter the “real
world.” Exercise has become a
priority in many students’
schedules along with attending
classes and studying.

Junior Tracy Sugra said she
sets aside specific time to
exercise.

“I try to fit in working out
three times a week for about
an hour and a half each day. I
either go to Forbes Fitness and
use the Stairmaster and
Nautilus or run or walk around
campus,” Sugra said.

“Studying is a priority, but I

manage to fit in my workout
most of the time.”

Aerobic exercise is a choice
selected by many women on
campus because they said aer-
obic tapes are not expensive
when compared to a member-
ship to a gym and also because
they can be used in privacy
and are convenient.

“I do Cindy Crawford’s
work-out about two or three
times a week,” Pitt student
Jennifer Miller said. “Using a
tape, you don’t have to leave
your apartment or mess around
getting to Trees [Hall] and
having a lot of people around.
You can exercise at two in the
morning if you want.”

There are many ways to stay
in shape on campus including
rollerblading or riding bikes to
class.

Trees Hall offers many
options to students free of
charge. You can do anything
from swimming to lifting
weights. Tennis can be played
indoors at the Cost Center. The

options are available, but

many students complain that
Pitt doesn’t offer enough to
non—athletes. Trees is often

crowded, and the facilities are ,

often used by the athletic
teams which leaves less avail—
able to others.

Alan Levine said he exercis-
es to stay in shape and often
has a difficult time doing so
because Trees needs improve-
ment.

“The facilities need drastic
improvements. It’s horrible
compared to other schools. I
like to play basketball, but
with only three courts they are
always filled and the weight
room is too small,” Levine
said. “We already pay so
much. We shouldn’t have to
fork out another $300 to join a
gym to get some exercise.”

Many students do pay the
money to join gyms. Forbes
Fitness manager Mike Lizik
said 70 percent of its members
are Pitt students.

Accordingpto Lizik, many
students join because they are
disgusted with Trees Hall and
many of them are serious

Pasquale agreed with Crowell on her
dedication to student outreach and said
that the Student Outreach Program was
the one element with which this year’s
board had difficulty. However, he men-
tioned the SGB’s success in other impor-
tant areas.

“We were able to increase the Student
Activities Fee so all of the student organi-
zations were able to fund programs and
activities and enhance student life on cam-
pus,” he said.

In addition, Pasquale said the SGB has
helped to make campus safety a more visi-
ble concern on a day—to-day basis, which
is why it helped to bring Debbie Gardner
to Pitt to do a safety seminar.

Other students said they

ing an art such as karate. The
manager at Chung Moo Doe
on Craig Street said 35 percent
of its members are Pitt stu-
dents. He said many students
like the idea that they offer the
eight styles of martial arts
combined as one.

Other board members helped to reach
out to different campus issues as well.
Eric McKinley, who recently helped to
bring African American-Jewish writer
Jeannine Amber to Pitt, said his views
were somewhat different than those of the
other nine members.

“I was the kind of board member that
always wanted to know exactly what was
going on because we vote on some very
serious things,” said McKinley. “I was
kind of like the voice of reason.”

McKinley displayed the efficiency of
the board when he said they were able to
vote together in all of the meetings.

McKinley
°From page 1

in political science and sociolo-
gy, is the first member of his
family to attend college and is
in the process of applying to
law schools, where he plans to
study criminal law or civil
rights.

“I’ve always looked up to the
profession,” said McKinley.
“My involvement has really
strengthened my position to go
to law school.”

McKinley said his desire to
get involved was sparked by a
poster for the SGB election. He

. pursued that desire with the

encouragement of his friends,
and in November L993 he was
elected to the board.

McKinley said he prides him-
self on being “level-headed,”
but there was a time in his
freshman year at Pitt when he
lost his cool.

He and three of his friends
from Penn State got swept into
a fight.

“I got into a huge brawl in the
Towers lobby,” said McKinley.

He said it was just one of
those stupid things that happen.

“I don’t think anyone would
characterize me as a fighter,”
said McKinley. “I was really
ashamed.”

APARTMENTS AVAILAB I
IN THE OAKLAND AREA

After his freshman year,
McKinley wanted to transfer to
Morehouse College in Atlanta.

“I really didn’t like Pitt at
all,” said McKinley, but he said
it was his involvement in SGB
and his jobs as a Freshman
Studies teaching assistant and a
resident assistant which gave
him a more positive outlook.

“Eric is a great guy, and he’ll
never forget you once he’s met
you,” said sophomore
Stephanie Alarcon, who had
Eric as her Freshmen Studies
TA.

“Where he shines is that he is
a listener,” said Joyce
Giangarlo, SGB advisor. “His
listening skills are more devel-
oped than other student leaders,
and that’s what makes him
valuable to us.”

“It makes me feel good to
hear people say positive things
about me,” said McKinley.

McKinley said he has learned
just as much through his
involvement as he has in any
class, and he encouraged stu-
dents to do the same.

“We pay a lot of money to
attend here,” said McKinley.
“Once it’s gone, it’s gone. So
we should maximize our oppor-
tunities.” ‘

Newt on welfare

Now that the Republicans have control of both houses of
Congress, welfare reform has become a viable issue again. There
are few who would dispute the need for some sort of welfare
reform. However, there are even fewer people who can actually
agree on a plan for reform.

Speaker of the House-in-waiting Newt Gingrich has his plan,
of course, and it has been getting a great deal of criticism recent-
ly. Gingrich supports a proposal which would ban states from
paying welfare benefits to children whose paternity is not estab-
lished and to those born out of wedlock under 18. The money
saved would then be used to establish orphanages and group
homes for unwed mothers and to promote adoption.

Gingrich argues that this is preferable to the present system,
which is “allowing the brutalization of children in this country.”
He claimed that there were over 800 cases of child abandomnent
is Washington, D.C. alone last year. Gingrich furthermore desires
the implementation of an 800 number which women could call
who desire to give up their children.

Gingrich’s program has been criticized from many sources.
Hillary Clinton called the program “unbelievable and absurd,”
and other critics have assailed the program as expensive.

While we agree that welfare refonn is desperately needed in
this country, we question Gingrich’s plarmed solution. First of all,
it really does nothing to address the problems of welfare. What is

the difference between cutting benefits to women under 18 com- -

pared to those who are, say, 22? The same socioeconomic prob-
lems occur regardless of age and may very likely be more pro-
nounced at a younger age. To isolate a particular age group is not
a solution to welfare, but rather sounds like Gingrich trying to
enforce his view of how society should be. It strikes us as just
more Christian “family values” talk and the legislation of morali-
ty.

Furthermore, welfare reform needs to be comprehensive. Even
if Gingrich’s program of eliminating beneﬁts is viable, which it
may be, it must be applied across the board. To target only cer-
tain groups with a speciﬁc plan will not solve the problem and
will only create more bureaucracy. Congress needs to work
towards developing a bipartisan comprehensive plan for welfare
reform. Despite their majorities, the Republicans do not have
enough votes to force through welfare reform. However,
Gingrich, who would likely formulate or play a signiﬁcant role in

. formulating a House plan, is far from acting in a manner which is

conducive to compromise. He has made other outrageous claims
such as claiming that a quarter of the White House staff use
drugs and has been vocal on his plans for a Bosnian solution.

Although some of his proposals are certainly viable or possible
solutions to problems facing the nation, Gingrich must remember
that he is not the president and is also not an enraged outsider.
Gingrich has reached the middle of the Washington power circle
and needs to stop playing politics and instead start trying to lead
the House of Representatives.

Republicans threaten to disrupt America

iolent criminal offend-
ers, your days are num-
bered! Welfare recipi-

ents, this Christmas thank God
for all the big checks you’ve
received from the government.
Your days of getting money to
smoke dope and make babies
are over!!! And to you young
healthy sixty-five-year—old
grandparents, did you really
think that you’d get a social
security check so soon? Get
out and work five more years
and maybe you’ll live to see a
social security check! And if
not, you know the rules: “Two
things are sure in this life -
death and taxes!” Buckle your
seatbelts tight, America! The
Republicans are now at the
wheel! Wow.

Thank God the elections are
over. All through the months
before the election, there was a
steady stream of propaganda
ﬂowing out of the speakers of
our televisions and radios.
Propaganda about crime.
Propaganda about welfare.
Propaganda about the sixties’
“Great Society “ programs and
how debilitating these pro-
grams have been to the econo-
my. Of course, as with most
propaganda there is some truth
in these ideas. The problem is
that it’s not the whole truth.

Often when these slippery,
slick, designer politicians talk

about an issue, only part of the ‘

issue is presented. For exam-
ple, every third politician talks
tough on the crime issue. We’ll
hear things like, “We don’t
make any excuses for violent
criminals. If a person or per-
sons commit a violent crime,
they will go to jail for life.”
Lately this has been played
over and over again in the ears
of the people so much that it
seems like a tough-talking
tournament.

The sad thing about this is
that the vast majority of politi-
cians never talk about solving

the problem of crime. Any fool
can say, “If you do a crime,
you’ll do the time!” But not
every politician will step off of
his high horse and say, “I’m
willing to try and address the
issue of why so many people
turn to violent crime” and then
do it when he gets elected.
People are not born “violent
criminals.” People turn to vio-
lence and violent crimes as a
way of getting what they want,
just as the so-called “Founding
Fathers” did ' when they
reached North America. In
fact, America is founded on
violent crimes by violent crim-
inals like Christopher
Columbus and Andrew
Jackson. And today the televi-
sion advertises and glarnorizes
every aspect of “violent

crime,” making it look fash- -

ionable to the gullible. If these
slippery politicians were really
honest and really wanted to see
a result other than seeing every
young black man in jail, they
wouldn’t talk about simply
throwing people in jail, but
they’d search for ways to elim-
inate the need for people to
turn to violent crime.

Another big issue is that of
welfare. To be a fashionable
politician, one must know how
to talk that tough talk about
taking people off welfare. The
implication about welfare is
that the majority of people on
it are black (which is false)
and that they are on it due to
sheer laziness and failure to
“pull themselves up by their
own bootstraps” as other
immigrant groups have done in
this country. This is the big lie.
There would have been no
need for welfare or “Great
Society” programs if black
people were not segregated,
kidnapped and terrorized by
violent criminals parading in
white sheets and without
sheets.

Sometimes I get the impres-

sion that when many of these
media personalities and big
politicians speak they actually
believe that people want to live
on welfare as if it were some
type of occupation. Nothing is
further from the truth. Most
people who are on welfare do
not want to be on it. They did
not consciously make the deci-
sion: “Here’s a good occupa-
tion for me. I guess I’ll receive
welfare checks for a living”.
No. If many of the people who
are on welfare would have had
a better opportunity to get a
good job and a good educa-
tion, they would have done it,
but most haven’t had the
opportunity or the advantages
of some of these big-mouthed
personalities.

The history of the United
States, moreover, points to
America as the home of wel-
fare. For 400 years, the United
States survived on the hand-
outs of the enslaved African
masses. Millions of African
men and women were worked
from “can’t see in the morning
to can’t see at night,” and they
received none of their money
for their labor.

What do you think the
Thanksgiving scene is? It’s the
early Americans receiving a
square meal from the generous
Native people of this land; oth-
erwise they probably would
have starved just like that
group at Jamestown. This is
how America received its wel-
fare checks! -

I don’t think some of these
so-called “conservatives” real-
ize how stupid they sound
when they start attacking
everyone else for doing just
what America has done for
years.

I'm not a Republican or a
Democrat. I’m just fed up.

Pirates game.

But be careful. The NCAA
is lurking over your shoulder.
Make sure the popcorn you’re
eating was paid for with your
money. If someone offers you
a sip of their drink don’t take
it: it could be an undercover
NCAA official.

The twisted and petty long
arm of the NCAA law
reached out and slapped the
junior forward for accepting
an invitation to a Pirates
game last summer. The end
result: a one game suspension
which he served Saturday.

As a favor to a 12-year-old
fan, Thomas attended the
baseball game. The key word
here is “favor.” Thomas did
not ask to go nor does it seem
that he volunteered to take *
the fan. But this situation is
only black and white in the
eyes of the NCAA.

It shows what a pathetic
system the NCAA is. They
called Thomas’ act an “inad-
vertent” secondary rules vio--
lation. Inadvertent? Then
why was he punished?

The rule states that an ath-
lete who accepts “extra bene-
fits” from anyone other than
a family member is consid-
ered in violation of NCAA
rules.

Is it possible that I cannot
buy Garrick Thomas a beer
one night in fear of violating
an NCAA rule? Or what if
Thomas’ sister’s husband’s
brother buys him a C.D.? Is
that in violation? What exact-
ly are “extra benefits?” Does
every major college have a
guide listing what these bene-
fits are?

Now Thomas and the
University of Pittsburgh
made restitution to the per-
sons who provided these
“gifts.” The amount was val-
ued at $48.74.

It’s a picturesque moment,
the NCAA regulation and
rules board reclining in their
chairs smiling, with expen-
sive champagne and cigars
for all. knowing that Pitt isn’t
getting away with anything.

It is a case where the
almighty NCAA has made it
a point to put its foot down,
show its power and build

St. John's storms past stubborn Pitt, 88-83

By Jack Becker
Senior Staff Writer

Andre Alridge’s three-pointer
from NBA range clanged off
the back of the rim with Pitt
trailing by four. St. John’s
Felipe Lopez emerged with
ball, wisping down the wing for
a finger-roll layup that sealed
the outcome in the Red Storm’s
favor 88-83 at the Civic Arena
last night. Lopez’s bucket ended
an improbable second-half
comeback from a Pitt team that
showed little sign of life in the
initial 20 minutes.

“It was two distinct halves,”
Pitt coach Ralph Willard said.
“The first half very tentative,
almost afraid basketball team
wearing the University of
Pittsburgh uniforms. They
sensed the fear in our eyes in
the first half. It was like a pack
of wolves smelling blood. Well,
we sensed the fear in their eyes
in the second half.”

Having their collective backs
to the wall is becoming such a
familiar experience for the Pitt
Panthers that they actually seem
to play best in ‘that situation.
The Panthers waited until after
both Chad Varga and Garrick
Thomas, had fouled out, cutting
the available scholarship play-
ers back down to five, to step

Lopez live

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor

Having already been fea-
tured on the cover of Sports
Illustrated without breaking
his first collegiate sweat,
Felipe Lopez finally showed
why he’s one of the most her-
alded freshman ever.

Lopez single-handedly
sliced, leaped and picked
apart Pitt offensively and
defensively without hardly
even breaking a sweat.

The 6-foot-5-inch wirey
guard led all scorers with 23
points in his first dose of Big
East basketball, as St. John’s

" topped the Panthers 88-83

last night at the Civic‘ Arena.

“I just go out there and be
confident in myself,” Lopez
said, “and believe I can real-
ly do it out there. I had a lot
of fun.”

And it showed. He was
often seen shaking his shoul-
ders and wiggling his arms
after he scored, as he did
after he kissed a jumper off
the glass with 6:19 gone in
the game.

In only his fifth collegiate
game, Lopez’s flamboyance
isn’t meant to show up the
other team.

“Basketball is fun to me,”
he said. “It's just the same
basketball game; you just
have to try a little bit harder.”

Lopez, a Dominican
Republic native, displayed
every facet of the game. A
trampoline leaper, he sailed

up the defensive pressure and

defenders knew what had
happened. At 180 pounds,
Lopez showed he can also
muscle down low by fielding
Garrick Thomas’ best shot
when he went up for a mon-
ster dunk, hung in the air and
scored on his way down.

But where Lopez really

shone was on defense. The
official scorekeeper credited
him with three steals, but he
nabbed several loose balls
and created more turnovers
than they could count.
“Defense is really my main
concern,” he said. “My main
concern is to stop my man. I
don’t worry about offense,

l3 second-half turnovers and 25
on the game.

After Thomas fouled out at
the 10:28 mark, Pitt went on a
28-14 run that was kicked off
when Jaime Peterson, who led
the Panthers with 18 points and
12 rebounds, threw down a
breakaway dunk. Peterson stole
the ball on the Red Storm’s next
possession, Alridge converted a
layup and Pitt was on its way.

The Panthers were forbidden
their trademark three-pointers
by an in-the-shirt, man-to-man
St. John’s defense but shot 50
percent from the field in the
second half to claw back into
contention.

Jason Maile, 17 points,
scored 10 points during Pitt’s
surge in a variety of ways.
Maile’s baskets came on five
foul shots, a three-pointer and a
prayer-of-a—scoop shot in traffic
that dropped through. Alridge,
three assists, also scored seven
of his 15 points during that
stretch.

“I could smell the opportunity
to win the game,” Willard said.

In the ﬁrst half, the Panthers
continued where they left off in
the second half of the North
Carolina game by feeding the
opposition with uncontested
breakaway layups off of

her own
record at
Classic

By Tawnya Adams
Staff Writer

All-America runner
Najuma Fletcher qualified for
the ECAC’s and the National
Championship and broke her
own school record at the
Holiday Classical Invitational
at West Virginia University’s

indoor track meet this past _

Saturday.

Placing in the pentathlon,
high jump and the long jump
all qualified her for the
ECAC’s.

To be able to compete in
this, the women must have
qualifying places during the
season.

Fletcher broke her own
school record in the pen-
tathlon with a total of 4,203
points. She had a high jump
of 5-11 1/2 that qualified ‘her
for the national champi-
onships along with a 20-7 3/4
long jump that also qualified
her for the championships.

Fletcher wasn’t the only
one to place in the pen-
tathlon; five of her team-

because I know that is going
to come.”

His in-your-face defense
stemmed from his turbo
speed. If you blinked, you
would have missed a steal or
a score.

Pitt point man Andre
Alridge can attest to that. He
looked away for a split sec-
ond: the ball was gone and
Lopez was trucking down the
center of the court for a two-
handed slam. But this time he
was slammed —— by good
buddy "Orlando V Antigua’s
swat.

“He said he slowed down
so he could dunk it on me,”
Antigua said.

But that was the only minor
glitch in the 1993 high school
Player of the Year’s game.

Lopez dazzled the crowd
with acrobatic moves like
snagging fellow stellar fresh-
man Zendon Hamilton’s miss
and going straight up with his
back turned to the basket and
laying it in with a swift flick
of his wrist.

Lopez showed that his abil-
ity isn’t just hype, that he
could possibly be the next
best player to ever come out
of high school since Lew
Alcinder, as basketball ana-
lysts have said.

But Lopez doesn’t listen to
that.

“Basically Ijust try to be
myself,” he said, “and the
hype will never get to you. I
just do what my coaches
want me to accomplish and
not worry about what others
want me to accomplish.”

turnovers.

Pitt held a lead as high as
three until an extraordinarily
fast St. John’s team began to
pilfer the ball from the
Panthers. Pitt committed 13 of
its 17 turnovers during the first
half.

The Red Storm players were
so quick that at one point for-
ward Rowan Barrett made a
move that left one of his sneak-
ers behind.

In fact, Lopez alone was such
a blur that the statistician had
trouble keeping pace. Lopez,
who scored a game-high 23
points, was officially credited
for three steals in the game but
picked up his fourth before four
minutes had expired.
Unofficially, Lopez had six
steals.

mates also helped to give the
women a sweep in this event.
The Panthers didn’t get sec-
ond place but captured third
through seventh places, with
Megan Ferrava (3,063),
Shaua Fadis (3,062),
Gennifer Washington
(2,916), Tina Mapel (2,674)
and Allison Sams (2,583) all
contributing with their
points.

Not only did Fletcher break
records at the meet, but Zenia
Ayrton proved herself to be a
highlight on the team as well.
By running the 55-meter dash
in seven seconds flat, she
now holds the second fastest
time in this event in school
history.

This time qualified her for
the ECAC’s along with her
first place finish with the
mile relay team.

The foursome of Zenia
Ayrton, Joetta Purter, Angie
Martin and Lakeya Smith
teamed up to give the mile
relay team a first place finish
with an ECAC qualifying
time of 3:52.

“We did the best that we
could be expected to do for
the ﬁrst meet,” Martin said.

A second place finish was
taken by Martin in the 500-
meter dash.

“I did OK, but last year I
did better,” Martin said. “I
wasn’t running my best. I
should’ve done better.”

After all this, the women
weren’t finished for the day.
Although they swept the 55-
meter hurdles, they had to
settle for second, third and
fourth behind WVU’s 7.87.
Staci Suggs took second with
8.02, and teammates Tonya

Mullins (8.20) and Joetta 1
followed V

Purter (8.45)

behind.

Mullins also starred in the 

200—meter dash, qualifying
for the ECAC’s with a time
of 25.25.

“I feel I did what I was I

supposed to do,” Mullins
said. “I was disappointed I
only ran a 25.25. I felt good
and was hoping I ran some-
thing better.”

Despite the places and
qualifying times the women
had, some of them weren’t
happy-

This could be an indication
of how well the team will do
this season, because they are
striving to do better even
though they had a good meet.

The men did just as well
despite the fact that
Alexander, Dietrich Jells and
Purset were not competeting
at the invitational.

Jay Jones just left the foot-
ball field and ran the fastest
time in Pitt’s history (6.27) in
the 55-meter dash. This qual-
ified him for the IC4A and
was a NCAA provisional
time.

Frank Nesco won the
30,000—meter dash in 8:52.6
and came back and won the
mile in 4:22.4.

Mark Bufalini set a person-
al best with his second place
finish in the mile with a time
of 4225.5.

Another IC4A qualifying
time was set by Jay Murphy

9 in the 55-meter hurdles with

7.53.

. Rounding out the finishes
for the men was field mem-
ber Ken Pegram, with a sec-

ond place finish in the shot I

put with a throw of 43 650.

upon a reputation for strict
and harsh punishments.

Look at the Auburn football
program. Hit with numerous
violations the Tigers were
and are suspended from
appearing in bowl games, yet
they remain ranked and
receive constant national
attention.

Compare that to what hap-
pened to Thomas.

Look at the case of Kevin
Willard, son of head coach
Ralph Willard. Upon accep-
tance of the Pitt job, the
younger Willard received
threatening phone calls while
at Western Kentucky.
Certainly, when a player
transfers from one school to
the next, a year of sitting out
should be enacted. But when
the transfer is treated as an
outcast at a university where
he wants to stay, a special
exemption is in order.

It is understood that the
university notified the NCAA
of Thomas’ doings. Pitt
called to cover its behind, to
be safe rather than take the
chanceof the NCAA finding
out on its own. For whatever
ridiculous reason it has, this
institution handed down the
sentence.

In the coming months with '

the hope of the baseball strike
coming to an end, I would
like to attend a game or two
down at Three Rivers
Stadium. So to you, Mr.
Thomas, I extend an invita-
tion.

You buy your ticket, pay
for your transportation and
I’ll do the same. We’1l_call
the NCAA ahead of time and
make sure everything is on

‘ the up—and—up.

But you have to pay for the
phone call.
