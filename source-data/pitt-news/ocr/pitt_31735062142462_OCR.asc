Drive Started

By Committee

A “jeep a wee ” is the pres- A " I

ent goal of the Stamp and
Bond‘ Drive committee, that
yesterday helped the University

commemorate the ﬁrst anniversary
of our entrance into the war.

Since February of this year, com-
mittee members have pushed the
sale of war stamps and bonds, aid-
ed by several other campus organ-
izations.

Women’s fraternities will assist
in sales each week. At the same
time, all the men’s fraternities will
be selling every week. They will
have no booth or designated sales
place, but will attempt to capitalize
on personal contacts.

Women of Delta Delta Delta start
the “jeep a week” program tomor-
row, with Ruth Swanson, Ed4-4, co-

‘ ordinating the effort for the com-

mittee and the Tri-Delts.

Purpose of having the four
jeeps visit the campus yesterday
was to emphasize the fact that
more than $4,500 in stamps and
bonds has been sold this semester
alone to students and faculty
members. Each jeep is valued at
$500, and every time the Univer-
sity students invest this amount
in the war effort, the government
places the Pitt insignia on an-
other jeep.

Tomorrow, when the “jeep a
week” phase of the present drive
is initiated, booths will be set up
in the ground floor elevator lobby
and on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of State hall.
Individual salesmen will cover the
entire campus from 8:30 until 5
o'clock. 1

PITT PLAYERS NAZIS
they were buffoonish, brilliant

Players Version Of Anti
Nazi Piece Proves Spotty

By ELAINE KAHN _ _
A somewhat confused Pitt audi-

ence got its ﬁrst view of the latest
Pitt Players production, “Till the
Day I Die” last Friday.

Supposedly a grim story of the
early Underground movement in
Germany and of the sacriﬁces it
demands of its workers, Pitt Play-
ers presented the ﬁrst three scenes
as though it were a kind of slap-
stick Abbott and Costello comedy.

We thought that by now it had
been fairly well established that
there is nothing funny about the Na-

‘zis, yet three stormtroopers are so

portrayed in the production that
when one of them selects what is

supposed to lie a battered, brutally

beaten suspect to “knock out” just
to prove his superiority, the audi-
ence laughed. And this, we feel
sure, was due not so much to any
sadistic tendencies on the part of
the audience as to the bulfoon-like

interpretation placed on the storm
troopers. I

“It is pleasant to be able to report,
however, that in the last three
scenes “Till the Day I Die” ﬁnally
manages to catch the spirit of the
thing and presents a fairly tense
and moving picture of the Under-
ground.

Many of the individual perform-
ances are excellent. Particularly
good were Edward Pitz in the role
of Major Duhring, the high Nazi
official who dispises Nazism; Mar-
tha Shissler who gave a ﬁne por-
trayal of Tilly Westerman, the
heroine of the story, and Edward
Lauth who is Ernst Tausig, the
leader of the underground move-
ment. Lauth was particularly good
in the ﬁnal scene which he carries
off almost singlehanded.

We have only one criticism to
make of “Till the Day I Die.” This
would concern Scene V, when Ernst
appears in Tilly's rooms and an-
nounces that his back has been cut
to ribbons by Nazi lashes and he
cannot bear to have anyone even
touch it. We do not think that he
would then lie down ﬂat on said
back.

Hears Proposal i
For Judicial Body, it I
StudentTransportation

A proposed amendment that would add a judicial body
to the make-up of the Student-Faculty Association was refer-
red to the committee on constitutional revisions for further
study and for possible changes at last Wednesday’s assembly

meeting.

Although the proposed amendment was sharply opposed
by many of the members of SFA, the issue was not divided

along party lines.
Dean of Women,

Helen Pool Rush opposed the proposed

court on the grounds that it was negative in its nature and

did not express any positive aims.
She said in effect that the court,

/would dare the students to break
the laws. This, she said would
create the impression in other uni-
versities that Pitt students were
undisciplined.

Fraternity men Bob Burford,
E44, and Dave Truan, C44, were
opposed to the court on the
grounds that it diffused authority.

Chief supporters of the Judicial
amendment were Ed Tablac, C44;
Abe Bluestone, C44, both of whom
are Independents, and fraternity
man Lee McFadden, BA44.

Abe Bluestone expressed his fav-
or of the court by saying, “the
court would give the student gov-
ernment power by placing author-
ity in the hands of the students,
rather than in the hands of the ad-
ministration.”

Following is the amendment as
it is referred to the constitutional
revisions committee:

Sev. A. There shall be a judicial
court of SFA.

Sec. B. Composition of the court:

1. There shall be nine members
—at least ﬁfth semester students
who are eligible for activities.

2. It shall be presided over by
a chairman, a member of the court
who has completed six semesters.

3. The court and the chairman
shall be appointed by the execu-
tive committee with the approval
of the majority of the SFA.

Sec. C. Powers of the court:

1. It shall receive complaints
and charges from faculty, SFA
committees, and students regard-
ing infractions of SFA rules.

2. It shall hear and judge on
evidence presented to it regarding
infractions of rules.

' 3. It shall impose appropriate
penalties, as determined by a code
set up by SFA.

4. It shall, when any dispute
arises, interpret the constitution of
SFA and its opinion shall be ﬁnal.

Robert K. Graham, publicity di-
rector of the University and fac-
ulty advisor to student publica-
tions, has been commissioned a

Outstanding Men

Receive Awards

For Scholarship

Outstanding Jien ofthe fresh-
man class will be awarded Pan-
ther keys at Honor Court Friday

at 12:30 o'clock. Attendance is »

compulsory for every one of the
750 freshman men. This includes
advanced freshmen, who also will
receive awards.

Basis for the award has been
changed from previous years. In
the past much consideration was
given to the customs examinations.
It was decided at a recent Men’:
council meeting that due to a lack
of a well organized orientation
program the customs examination
would not be a prerequisite for the
award, explained Kenneth Fegley,

E45. Fegley is the chairman of   '

student awards committee. A .
This year the leading emphasis

will be on scholarship. Activities -‘

are also being emphasized. Ev-
erything will be determined by
a point scale system. In case of
ties upperclassmen advisors will
be consulted for recommenda-
tions.

Only eighty of the 750 summon-
ed to the court will receive the
awards. No information as to‘ the
winners will be issued until the
court is in session.

Personnel of the Honor Court
will be made up of prominent stu-
dents, acting as associate judges.
in addition to members of Men’:
Council.

Parents of advanced freshmen were not
invited to the Chancellor’s Reception.

Men and women advanced freshmen were
making this complaint last Friday and yes-
terday, and legitimately so, we think. .

It seems the advanced freshmen are being ~
left out of many things that go along with
’ proper adjustment to University life.

The women are not eligible for fraternity
rushingvuntil next March, the same time as
the present ﬁrst semester freshmen. In a re-
cent speech contest for freshman women, ad-
visers urged their mentor groups to enter,
but the advanced girls were not allowed to
participate. There are other instances which

Just because these students have attained
advanced standing because of the University’s

be excluded from any indoctrination events,

which are important to new students.

By JERRY RIPP
The stress is on offense this

. season as far as the Pitt bas-

ketball team is concerned. Up
to this year Coach Dr. H. C.
Carlson has always held to
the “Win ’em all” slogan as a
pre-season motto. With the

it new system of blitzing the oppo-

sition the motto has become “Fifty
points or no count."

In all of the warm—up games
played in preparation for the com-
_ing season the Panther cagers
have scored at least ﬁfty points.
The new style employed by them
is a fast, spectacular one and will
not vary in spite of varying de-
fenses thrown against it.

Bob Artman, who with Tay
Malarkey, Paul Lohmcyer, Walt’
Jones and Johnny Swacus make
up the first team, feels that the
new Pitt offense will be able to
cope with any type of defense.
Artman declared, “Teams that
use the zonedefense, like Penn

State, will not have time to get.

their defense set up.”

» We watched the Carlsonmenl god
‘H .
through

one of their practice
games last Tuesday and Artman’s
' statement was conﬁrmed as the

Panthers fast-breaking offense be-~

- wildered the opposition.

\

Pitt’s starting ﬁve plays as a
well-balanced, heads-up group.
a Each player knows what to do and
when to do it. Biggest problem
that faces coach Carlson as he at-
tempts to mold a winning combina-
tion out of the eleven players on

the squad is the lack of adequate

reserve strength.
' Last Tuesday when we watched

them play, the ﬁrst team was very"

. impressive. Bob Artman looks
like the best point maker the
Panthers will have, while Tay
Malarkey is taking up where he
leftsoff lsat season in his clever
all’-around playing. .
Walt Jones has‘ gained a lot
from the year’s‘ experience he had
last season. Although he’s the

smallest man on the squad Jones‘

is the best conclitioned, and prob-
ably will be able to stand the gaff
of playing nearly all of every game
better than any other member of
the team. . . -

improvetdfcagei‘. For. tlie past two
“years Iiehls been.limited.to reserve
duty, but has. taken ‘advantage of

at this time. A

Nothing further has developed
in regard to the tentative game
with Grove City that may pre-
cede the scheduled opening con-
test with Ohio State, New Year’s
Eve. If arrangements can be com-
pleted with Grove City the game
will probably be played right af-
ter Christmas.

For the next two weeks the Pan-
thers will continue to face teams

from the Municipal League and‘
other semi-pro outﬁts. Following
.this, the usual tapering off process

will bring the Blue and Gold eleven

,man teamup to opening day.

Thus, another basketball season
is nearly here. This season. Pitt
will either be very hot or very cold,
but not in-between. The wide open
system they’re_ concentrating on
won’t allow for mediocrity.

Good or bad, the season will be .
. spectacular.

WAA dancing is being reorgan-
ized. All former members of this
group and new girls interested in
dancing should come down to the

gym at 12:30 today. The chair-

, man of this group, Marcella Strut-'
iel, C4-5, announces that the new

program will emphasize creative
and interpretive dancing. aThe
classes will begin as soon as
enough interested people make ap-
make this now, they may sign up
plication. If anyone is unable to

WAA’s new bulletin board is lo-
cated on the landing of the stairs
between the ground floor and base-
ment just outside the Blue and
Gold Tuck Shop. On this bulletin
board all the important announce-
ments about the WAA program
will be posted.

One of the most successful
phases of the WAA program is
the co-recreation program social
hour every Wednesday from 12 :30
to 1:30 in the gym. At the first
social hour last Wednesday, many
students enjoyed dancing and jit-
terbugging to the music of the
victrola that the Physical Educa-
tion Department has rented for
the year.

Totlay at 3:30 WAA is running
off the entire volley ball tourna-
ment. Many people have come out,
but anyone else who still wants to
play may come down today and be
put on a team. All teams will play
until one wins.

Competitive A thletics sway
Added in Indoor Track House

By ELAINE KAHN

Students enrolled in the University competitive athletics
courses will have three obstacle courses to worry about now
instead of Just two. The third course has just been installed

in the Indoor Track House which bounds the football

ﬁeld.

practice

The new course will provide the exercise supplied by the

the beneﬁts of
track. Known as Military Track,
the course as set up consists of
Starting at one
end of the track house, C.A. stu-
dents will run to the center of the
track where a set of four barriers
has been erected.

This little exercise is followed
by climbing over an eight loot
scaling ‘ivall. The student then
circles the track to his starting
point, travels along the “mon-
key” bars, and then takes anoth-
er jaunt around the track.

There will be two persons oili-
ciating. One to time the individual
and one to see that the boys start
oﬂ" at 10 second intervals. By run-
ning the boys off at ten second in-
tervals, as many as 150 boys can
go through the course in a class

period. It is also possible in this

way for a boy who has started
ahead to wind up behind those who
began later. Individual time rec-
ords will be kept for each boy.

The walk up to the Track Housed

via the behind-the-Athletic build-
ing route is to be regarded as part
of the course. The new obstacle
course is patterned after those in
use at the various training schools
throughout the country.

The Aathletic Department uti-
lized the last degree of patriotism
in constructing this course. Not
only did they build the course,
which is designed to build men
up for future military service, but

they adhered strictly to the ‘Inc-

by defense authorities. .

The obstacles were constructed
from old wood and metal which

been supposed that stadium at-
tendance in the near future will

The other two obstacle courses
now in use are those at Trees
Field and at the old Shadyside
Academy. They have been used
since the beginning of the year in
the Competitive Athletic Courses.
Thus far there have been lots of

Ol Women at War

EDITOR'S NOTE : This article is the second in a series reviewing the
resolutions drawn up by the major women’: activities on campus at the

University Women’; assembly recently, regarding the role of the col-

lege woman in the present crisis and the speciﬁc aims of each group.

Women's Speech association stated their aim “To foster
those principles on which our country was founded: open dis-
cussion, independent, creative thinking, and social well-be-
ing.” Their resolutions included a continuance of their pres-

ent program of contributing their
services to the University War
Information center.

WSA further suggests that there
be more meetings on campus to
discuss questions closely related to
the college women’s interest, and
questions of civic, national, and in-
ternational, importance; that there
should be a weekly assembly hour
for guest speakers, faculty and stu-
dent speakers, and important an-
nouncements. A

Young Women’s Christian associ-
ation expressed their aim “to allow
for an expression of spiritual val-
ues which are endangered by the

.present chaotic conditions——belief

in God, belief in man, and belief
in oneself.” YW recommends that

there be a re-emphasis on Chris-
tian living.

Women”s Athletic association

lists the following. among their

, aims: University women should
be made more conscious of their
health through periodical physi-
cal examinations, there should be
an educational nutrition program
advocating a well balanced diet,
and a physical ﬁtness program
should be set up with the present
University facilities whereby reg-
ular exercises through play could
be made compulsory for all Uni-
versity women.

Women’s Athletic association
pand their program so that those
who are not active members in the
organization may receive the bene-
ﬁts derived from music and par-
ticularly, in these times, the emo-

- tional release received through it.”

Among these aims are the fol-
lowing: increased emphasis on
group singing at the ﬁreplaces in
the Commons room, cooperation
-with other organizations desiring.
imusical programs, and contribu-
tions to the War Information cen-
ter.

There are two things about Gene.
Kelly, former Pitt student, that
helped to land him in Hollywood.
He is an excellentdancer and very,
very persuasive. (Frederick Oth-
man, United Press correspondent,
can prove how persuasive when he
recalls that Gene talked him into
giving the Kelly School of Dane-
ing a plug in what was meant to
be a strictly newsy news story.)

The hooﬁng Gene learned at the
Kelly School (now he’s got us do-
ing it). The gift of gab he might
have picked up at Pitt for he was
enrolled in the School of Law.

At any rate, Gene is in Holly-
wood -and doing great. He has just
completed “Me and My Gal" with
Judy Garland and George Murphy
and although it has recently been
released Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had
enough faith in the Pittsburgh
dancer to put him in another. They
will both be on the market at
about the same time. And already
Gene is rehearsing for the roman-
tic lead in “DuBarry Was a Lady.”
That, my friend, is good dancing
plus some good talking.

Before going Hollywood, he
made a name for himself in two
New York productions; “Time of
Your Life” and “Pal Joey.” He has

' worked a-s a bricklayer and soda

jerk but confesses that never
worked so hard as he did in his
first movie. (Are you still reading.

DR. J, ELLWOOD AMOS
drive for pennies ends

Pitt Penny Plan
Ends Coin Drive

When the Pitt Penny Plan came
to a conclusion last Friday ap-
proximately 2,000 dollars worth or
three—fourths of a ton worth of
pennies had been “traded in” and
returned to circulation.

Purpose of the drive was to re-
turn old pennies to circulation and
thus reduce the number of new
pennies that are made each month
by the mint. This inturn would
help to reduce the nation’s short-
age of copper, which is number
three on the priority list.

Finance 1 students, under the
supervision of Dr. J. Ellwood
Amos, associate professor of fin-
ance, conducted and planned the
drive throughout its duration here.

Dr. Amos was well satisﬁed with
the results of the drive and said
that future use of the plan in oth-
er schools will depénd on whether
or not the mint adopts galvanized-
steel pennies as a substitute for
copper pennies during the war.

Dancing Pitt Graduate Sells
Himself in 'Me and M yGal'

Dancing, Gene claims, is fun
and easy—if you go to the right
dancing school. Ma and Pa Kelly
are still managing his two
schools in Pittsburgh which
might be the reason for the hint.
Anyhow, Gene has not forgot-
ten his home town and is doing
a line job of boosting it.

Mr. Othman predicts that Gene
Kelly is really going places be-
cause he is a superb dancer and
“no slouch as an actor.” He is
blessed with the kind of an ugly
face which most folks like; nobody
will call him a pretty-boy. Add to
that his ability at selling himself
and it’s bound to add up to suc-
cess.

Say, where is this Kelly School

dred dollars when it is ﬁnally com-
pleted.

The room, which the University
has agreed to floor, plaster, and
paint, will contain trophy cases,
lounging‘ chairs, games, and tables.
Lighting ﬁxtures have been prom-
ised by the alumni who are doing
much to further the work on the
lounge.

BWOC'sOller5uggestions

To Freshmen on Dates, Etc.

By ABRAHAM BLUESTONE
Forty freshmen, the largest
YMCA turnout in years, heard the

views of four Pitt coeds as to .

“What ‘a Pitt man should know.”
Peggy Holland, C44; Betty Too-
hill, Ed43; Lola. Ward,’ C45,—and
Betty Ann Crede, C44, in a panel
discussion last Thursday, at the
YMCA freshman club, participat-
ed in the program.

Lola Ward, the first speaker,
gave the boys some advice on
dating. Miss Ward thought that
formal introductions were best,
and that “the first date ought
not be a house date.”

After this, Peggy Holland‘ con-
tinued with more advice on intro-
ductions, some pointers on man-
nerisms, “Twirling keys is bad,”
and ended with instructions on how
to suggest a place to go after
dances.

Betty Toohill emphasized correct
table manners and posture. Her
emphasis was on such social nic-
eties as not breaking crackers in
one’s soup, blowing the nose at
the table, and so on.

According to Betty Ann Crede,
girls have acclimated themselves
to wartime conditions to the ex-
tent of riding streetcars on dates,
or meeting their boy friends in
town “in front of the Brass Rail.”
Miss Crede then threw a bomb
into the meeting by announcing
that she thought that the ﬁrst

date should be solo, instead of
double, as the other three girls
had agreed.

While the other girls agreed on
going steady in theory, Miss Crede,
who is now pinned to Gus Wilde,
gave some advice gleaned from ex-
perience. According to her, going
steady was all right when a girl
had found a fellow she enjoyed be-

ing with and going with all the

time.

At the conclusion of each speech - U
the audience asked questions of the ~

speaker. The questions dealt with
such things as whether it was all
right to let a girl know if she had

some obnoxious characteristic, talk- j
mg while dancing, and the great

issue of going steady.
