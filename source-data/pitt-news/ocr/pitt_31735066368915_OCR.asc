After dissolving its own scholar-

ship program, the state Senate
must now reallocate $3.1 million in

__ aid formerly set aside for some

' , students‘ at state-related schools.

One proposal discussed in

’ various Senate committees, accord-
ing to Student Government Board
member Bernie’ Popko, would be_ to
-transfer the_ funds to the Penn-
sylvania Higher Education Assis-

tance Agency, creating a scholar- ‘

ship program based on merit.

“It has been put down on paper
but never formally acted on,’f‘
Popko said. _

“Right now there are no
provisions anywhere in the Com-
monwealth aid system for merit-
only need,” he added. “Four
tenths of one percent of the aid
allocated to Pitt is allocated on
merit. This means that over 99
percent is given out solely on the
basis of ﬁnancial need.”

back both of them.”

planning to go to Harvard.”

_ Popko introduced a resolution to
the SGB last week requesting ‘the
General Assembly to transfer
Senatorial scholarship monies to
the PHEAA. The SGB tabled
voting on the measure.

“They (PHEAA deﬁnitely have
the personnel‘ and ' administrative
ability to handle this,” Popko said.

Popko added that state Senators

would play no part in distributing‘

the scholarship money.

_ “The (previous) program had
allowed the Senate member X
numbers of scholarships to dis-
tribute,” Popko said. “The
scholarships were awarded basical-
ly as political favors. There were
even a number of state Senators
who gave them to relatives.”

Tack Guilty of Disorderly Conduct}

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staff Writer

City Magistrate Anthony ‘Tri-
ano sentenced Ed Tack, a reporter
for The Pitt News, to a 15-day
suspended sentence‘ for disorderly
conduct after Tack agreed to drop
the police brutality charges he had
ﬁled against Pittsburgh City Police
Ofﬁcer Thomas O’Connor.

9 Triano also sentenced Tack’s
co-defendent, Stan Jones, to pay a
ﬁne of $100 or serve 15 days in jail
for disorderly conduct and public
intoxication.

After hearing testimony by the
prosecution and defense witnesses
during a hearing in city court
Friday, Triano angrily lectured
Tack for ten minutes before
delivering sentence on Tack and
Jones.

“We’ve seen enough ceaseﬁres

said Fuad Farah, a travel agent in
charge of a basement bunker for 25
families. .

Witnesses reported the Syrians-

from the Christian region of
northern Lebanon. The bridge links
with the north remain in Syrian
hands despite repeated assaults last
week by militiamen.

A Syrian commander scorned the

Division) and there. have been
newspaper articles written. 'In his
zeal, he has brought the whole
police force up to public ridicle
when an ofﬁcer was doing‘ his

After he’ sentenced Tack and
Jones, Triano added that he hoped
Tack would learn something from
his experience. . “I hope he (Tack)
has learned a lesson that will serve
him well as a reporter. If an ofﬁcer
is doing his duty, he should report
what he sees and that’s all,” said
Triano. I

Prosecution and defense witnes-
ses described the events that led to
the arrest of Tack and Jones in the
early morning of Sunday, Sept. 17.

said he cited city ordnance and
Jones then made several deroga-
tory remarks and shoved O’Connor

on the shoulder.
At that point,‘O’Connor' said he _

arrested Jones and began to escort
him across Bouquet Street toward
the White Tower Restaurant.‘
According to O’Connor, Jones
turned on him in the middle of the
street and the two wrestled.

O’Connor said someone grabbed
him by the left shoulder and
attempted to spin him. O’Connor
testiﬁed he heard someone say
“reporter,” and ‘he turned to see
Tack standingbehind him in an
offensive position.

O’Connor said he struck Tack
once with his fist while his night
stick was in his hand.‘ He said his

night stick then flew from his hand '

and he had to e11ter into the prowd
of onlookers to retrieve it. .

Officer George Lothrop, who
assisted O’Connor with the arrests
of Jones .and Tack,‘ verified
O’Connor’s version of the incident
at the Original’. _

Tack told a completely different
account ‘of his arrest._ He said
O’Connor pulled Jones from the
doorway of the Original after Jones
questioned the officer about
McCormick’s dog. He testiﬁed
O’Connor struck Jones with his
night stick two times. '

According to Tack, he addressed
O’Connor‘ from the sidewalk after

Popko Urges New Ai

(Continued from page I)

Popko added the program was
never approved by the PHEAA or.-
'signed into law by the governor‘ but
conducted independently by the
Senate. ' i

According ‘to Popko, no transfer
of money was ever recorded when

scholarships were given to students‘

attending Pitt, Temple, Penn ‘State
and‘ Lincoln Universities. The
money, $300 per term, was instead
subtracted from the
‘bills. - -

“No money wasever received‘ by
the‘ University,” Popko said.
“It was simply a loss of revenues.
It would show up as an expenditure

it,” Tack
O’Connor. ,
Tack said O’Connor then ap-
proached him and struck him once
on the head with a nightstick.
However, Jones, who was also
arrested for public intoxication,
could not recall being hit by
O’Connor’s nightstick. He did
remember that O’Connor swung
his nightstick and admitted the
officer forced him to his knees.
After the trial, the assistant
district attorney lectured Tack for
his comments to The Pitt News on
his case and his filing of police
brutality charges against O’Conn-
or. “It is the District Attorney
ofF1ce’s position that taking a case
to the newspapers before it first
appears in court is a substantial
misuse of justice,”. said Assistant
District Attorney James‘ Lees.

said he called to

dispersements.”

Popko said each state senator
had been permitted 32 scholarships
to award, and ‘ approximately .28

percent of the recipients‘ attended

Pitt. Termination of the program
has affected some 1,300 students’ at
Pitt.

The Senate voted to dissolve the
program last month ' after the
Philadelphia Inquirer’ and‘ other

state newspapers reported that

many ' senators awarded scholar-
ships solely on the basis of political
ties and ‘references, without taking
need or merit into’ consideration.
Popko said his resolution,
written with help from former SGB

member Chip Hubbard,’ calls for V

the General Assembly “to set up a
system that would weight various
ideas,” such as need, merit and
extra curricular activities.

Popko said the idea has been
supported in the past by the state
board of education and ‘officials at
state related universities, including

Pitt Chancellor Wesley Posvar.

TO: COLLEGE STORE MANAGER

We've needed a SHOWCASE for creativity in the communications arts fora long time.
A magazine by and for college students is an idea whose time has come. l’m'looking
forward to the January issue! ’

opher Columbus made his first
voyage of discovery to the New
World.

The publication also says that on
the same expedition, ‘a Spanish
explorer named Esteban Gomez

gave the name Rio de San Antonio‘

to the waterway known today as the
Hudson River. That was 80 years
before English sea captain Henry
Hudson discovered the river, the
authors say.

The Department of Energy
Publication, issued on the eve of the
486th anniversary of Columbus’
discovery of America, is part of a
program to highlight contributions
of Spanish-Americans to the
development of the United States.

Entitled “A Salute to Hispanic-
Americans in Science and
Industry,” it focuses mainly on
contemporary contributions of
Hispanics in science and tech-
nology. But the narrative also
deals with history. _

The authors, Domingo and
Conchita Reyes, quote from hist-
orian John Fiske’s “The Discovery
of America,” last published in

1893, for the claim that the village '

of San Miguel de Guadalupe was
founded by Spanish explorers 84
years before Jamestown was
established on what is now the
James River in Virginia‘.

Fiske’ credited the effort to
Spanish navigator Lucas Vasquez
d’Allyon, '-“who came up in 1524
from Hispaniola now the Domin-
ican Republic and ‘tried the James
River and the Chesapeake Bay.

“Not ﬁndinga northwest pass-
age, but liking‘ the country, he
obtained a grant ‘from Charles V
and, in 1526, began to build a town
called San Miguel, about where the
Englishman founded Jamestown.”

The authors said later history
texts “were never to record or to
tell the story of this version of the
discovery of North America.”

Pitt Frosh
Guilty In
. Rape Case

Frank Wilson, a University (9
Pittsburgh freshman, has been
found ‘guilty of sexually assaulting
a Bloomfield woman last April 11
in abathroom inside the Cathedral.

Wilson, 21, of 1303 Richmond
St., Regent ‘Square, was found
guilty of involuntary deviate sexual
intercourse and terroristic threats
Friday, but was acquitted on four
charges that stemmed from a
second alleged sexual assault in the
Oakland ‘area.

Common Pleas Judge James F.
Clarke also revoked Wilson’s
$2,000 percentage bond ‘and
ordered that he be placed in the
County’ Jail after he learned Wilson‘
had been arrested for a thrid
alleged assault on a -woman that he

  

supposedly committed when he .

was awaiting trial on the two earlier
cases.

Clarke said he planned to
schedule a hearing ‘within the next
two weeks after which he would
decide whether Wilson should be
released on bond ’ again while he
was awaiting ‘sentence.

Wilson faces a possible jail term
of 11 to 22 years for his conviction.

The charges of which Wilson was
acquitted stemmed from an attack
on a Brushton woman in a‘ building

near the Cathedral four days befoif.

the assault of the Bloomﬁeld
woman.

Wilson had been charged with
rape, indecent assaultupossession
of a ﬁrearm andreckless endan-
germent in that case. ‘

The victim’s identification ‘of
Wilson ‘was the only‘ evidence
against the defendant in the second
case, and Assistant District Attor-
ney Jose Hernandez-Cuebas
explained that her identification
had become confused. '

Although the Brushton woman
was unable to pick Wilson from
police line-‘up, she later pick an
Wilson’s picture from a group of
photos and claimed he was her
attacker. A

Judge Clarke also ordered a
pre-sentence report and a report»
from the Allegheny County Behav-
ior Clinic before he sentenced the_
defendant.

 TheEnd

of Blue Laws

. , » Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court last week abolished

all of the state’s so-called “blue laws,” statutes
which prohibited some businesses from operating on
Sundays. Although the Court’s decision will have lit-
tle practical effect (blue laws had been widely ignored
in recent years, by businesses and law enforcement
agencies alike), the symbolic significance of the
ruling is worth noting.

Blue laws began in Pennsylvania in 1682, when
citizens were enjoined to “abstain from their usual
and common toil and labor” on Sunday. Given the
prevailing religious climate of the day and the modes
of production employed by —17th century Penn-
sylvanians, such a law probably met with little op-
position and considerable favor. Secularization and
industrialization had not yet happened to America,
and it still seemed reasonable to refrain from
“worldly pursuits” one day a week. _

Not so anymore. Early in the 19th century, the In-
dustrial Revolution was imported from England, and
economic activity became a non-stop necessity——at

least in the eyes of those who controlled production.
At the same time, America was increasingly losing
contact with its religious roots, and, as immigration
"swelled the cities, was ‘evolving into a more pluralistic
culture. Biblical injunctions against work on the
Sabbath began to lose their meaning.

The abolition of Pennsylvania’s blue laws is, then,
simply the latest step in a process that began a long
time aro. Whatever the merits of the Court’s
decision—and it is not without merit—it represents in
a significant sense the predicatable triumph of in-
dustrial commercialism and secular in a state that
was once the refuge of simple and devout Quaker.

Representatives of different businesses, (chain store
and supermarket operators in particular) have hailed
the end of benighted impediments to trade and
profit-makifng. Ministers of the organized religions
have looked with distress on what one of them called
“a further indication of a secularistic philosophy
which characterizes this nation.” '

The fact of the matter is that the time had come to
abolish the blue laws. It was a historical and cultural
event that was not to be avoided. In a political milieu
that emphasizes its disassociation from any" formal
religion, it made no ‘sense to perpetuate statutes

founded on the beliefs and traditions of one religious - .

group. Sunday, it is clear, is reallyno different than
any other day as far as .most Americans are concer-

ned. In a society that at least calls itself pluralistic, it_'

would have been‘ a clear injustice to continue to make

the observance of Sunday a requirement for none,

Christian entrepreneurs.

But it would be a mistake to hail the Court’s
decision without reservation. It behooves all of us to
consider whether the maximization of commerce,
consumption and convenience are really the great
benefits they are so often promoted and perceived to
be. For what the historical process behind the
abolition of blue laws has done is to replace
traditional values (i.e., periodic rest from labor and

' attention to spiritual health) with these other, more

materialistic ultimates. Keeping human needs and
natural limitations in mind, it remains to be seen
whether opening the whole week to economic en-
deavor is such a good idea after, all. "5"

Singlaub and the Cold War Mentality  

By ROD GRIFFITH

Since his retirement from the U.S.
Army, Major General John K.

Singlaub has appointed himself '

savior of the American people. He
now travels from city to city

spreading prophesies of doom for A

this country unless it repents and
begins pumping much more money
into the defense program.

Singlaub would have everyone
believe a modern generation of
made cossacks are ready to storm
across the border of West Germany
or to. ﬁre the ﬁrst missles to
complete a ﬁrst strike that would
destroy the SUnited States and

~ make the Soviet Union master of the

world. According to Singlaub, the
United States is practically naked
and defenseless before this awe-
some horde hovering outside our
borders.

When the retired major general’s
claims come under close scrutiny,
his warnings of imminent peril soon
decay into a twisted version of
reality. His statement on the delay
of production of the neutron bomb is
one example of the hodgepodge of
half-truth he sells on his road tour.

Singlaub’s criticism of President

Carter's decision to delay produc-

tion of the neutron bomb finally led,
to the major general’s’ early

retirement after the remarks were

publicized. When confronted with

facts that suggest delayed manufac-

ture of the bomb might not hurt the
United State’s ability to stop an
armored assault in Europe by the
Warsaw Pact nations, Singlaub fails
to support his claims.

Dr. Joseph Coffey, director of
Pitt’s Center for Arms Control and
International Security Studies has
publicly disagreed with Singlaub’s
statements on the need for the
neutron bomb. Coffey contends that
the neutron bomb is not that great a
technological development and that
other anti-tank defenses such as
helicopter-sown mines, precision
guided missiles and changes in
attack response patterns are being
developed that can help stop any
tank attack by WarsaWPact nations.

When challenged with Coffey’s
remarks, Singlaub can't manage
any satisfactory rebuttal to the
arguments. “I’m just basing my
arguments on the arguments given
NATO and the arguments given to
General Alexander Haig. I'm not
prepared to dispute any of Coffey’s

 

information, ’ ’ Singlaub commented

at a press conference in Pittsburgh
last week. ‘
The arguments by Singlaub and
others of the cold war mentality, who
warn of the possibility of a first strike
by the Soviets unless the United
States bolsters its defenses with
such armaments as the B-1 bomber
and the mobile ICBM system, fall to
pieces aftera close examination of all
the facts. - . ‘
The conservative doomsayers
who preach the need for increased
arms development maintain that

Soviet strategists truly believe the:

Soviet Union can successfully
launch a ﬁrst strike in a nuclear war
and win. They cite the Soviet
emphasis on civil defense and
construction of offensive weapons

systems as proof of the evil‘

intentions that lurk within the hearts
of Kosygin and Brezhnev.

A first strike by the Soviets would
not be as simple as the prophets of
the right would have Americans
believe. First, to manage a
successful ﬁrst strike, the Soviets
must evacuate their cities. The most
dense employee in the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow might notice
something is wrong when scores of
Moscovites march from the city.

 N

FOOD, on
BEVERAGES |

 

 

If the CIA operatives in the Soviet

, Union failed to notice this subtle sign

of an impending attack, other
safeguard systems could still warn
the Pentagon of any planned ﬁrst
strike. Surveillance satellites would
sense. any preparation of Soviet

_ missles, and the United States could

act against any attempted ﬁrst
strike. - _ .
Any first strike by the Soviet-
Union also _would not positively
destroy the ability of the United
States to retailiate. The destruction
of blast-proof, shock-proof missile
silos is difficult, and the ﬁrst
nuclear blasts could "destroy the

second wave of incoming nuclear

missiles. These factorsvmake it

impossible for the Russians to be
sure a ﬁrststrike could bring’ the
United States to_ its knees.

Hopefully, Soviet strategists are

bright enough to realize this and‘

would not attempt a ﬁrststrike.

Despite these points that deaden

' any credibility American hard-lin-
‘ ers have, the last of the cola

warrior—who clings to the naive
division of the world into the free
and the communist—still wanders

' the countryside, willing to talk to

the crowds of reserve ofﬁcers who
share his view of the world. It's

fortunate more level heads ﬁnally

have gained prominence in Wash-
ington. ’ V -

Letters

Support forB0iwlirizg Team Asked '

The purpose of this letter is to
urge the Pitt athletic department ‘to
fund "the Pitt bowling ‘team for the
1978-79 season. Presently, the
team receives absolutely no
funding from any‘ University
organization, and its continued
existence depends upon the

‘appropriation of some funds.

' The Pitt bowling team is a
member of the Western
Pennsylvania Intercollegiate
Bowling‘ Conference, which con-
sists‘ of 12 schools from the
surrounding area. Of those 12
schools, 11 are funded by either
their athletic departments or
student activities fees; the Pitt

' team receives no assistance. Of the

six southern division teams (Pitt’s
division),' four have their own
bowling alleys, ﬁve have coaches
and four practice every day of the
week. The Pitt bowlers, however,
must pay for everything (matches,
practice, transportation, league
entrance, etc.) themselves, do not
have their own alleys, do not have a
coach and practice only once a
week. Yet Pitt still makes a
respectable showing, finishing
fourth in the division last year and
placing one man on the league
all-star team.

The student personnel running
the program are outstanding

examples of the high academic and
leadership standards the Univ'e§'
sity tries to promote, and it is their
responsibility to act as coach,
captain, ‘secretary and liaison to the
league office. The bowlers
themselves must make great
ﬁnancial "sacriﬁces to compete on‘
an intercollegiate level, and it is
their gutsy determination and love
for competition that has kept the
bowling ‘program alive here at Pitt
for the past ﬁve years.

Let me ask you this: Have ‘you
any ‘knowledge of any ‘sports team
at any ‘major university that must

. make the sacriﬁces that the Pg

bowlers must make in order to
compete? I doubt you’ll ﬁnd one.

The team is not asking for a .

coach, bowling alleys, shirts or
jackets. What we are asking for is
a yearly budget of $500 so we can
pay for some of our expenses. The
team realized it does not‘ bring in
money to the school as do football
and basketball, but $500 is really a
nominal sum when you compare it
to the costs of supporting other
University teams that also do n9_t
bring in money (such as tennis,"
water polo and ﬁeld hockey) but are
university funded. We urge you to
consider appropriate funding for
the Pitt bowling team.

'Tormcito' is Another Winner For Yes A

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Yes

Tormato
Atlantic

Some rock groups get old, but not
Yes. Ten years after its founding,

. the group still exhibits the spirit and

energy it first revealed a decade
ago. Some of the faces have
changed since those early days, but
the quality music remains, current-
ly in the form of a new album,
“Tormato.”

Like the other albums, “Tor-
mato’ ’ is a vivid expression of Yes’s
musical aspirations. The personnel
on “Tormato” are the same
musicians Yes has been going with
for the last ﬁve years: Jon Anderson
on. vocals,’ guitarist Steve Howe,
bassist Chris Squire, Alan White on

drums and keyboard man Rick‘

Wakeman. When together, these‘
ﬁve musicians have a certain magic
that no other group can match.
“Tormato” reveals new direc-
tions for Yes. The songs are shorter
in length and more numerous than
songs on previous Yes albums.
None of the nine songs on
“Tormato” exceeds eight minutes
in length, unlike the side-long
tracks of earlier Yes efforts.
This arrangement allows for more

variety and versatility. Even though

Happy All The Time
By Laurie Colwin

Alfred A. Knopf

“Happy All The Time” is
described as a comedy of manners
and morals, but it is more than that.

‘ Laurie Colwin’s third novel is an

entertaining look at the romance
and friendship between two couples
that prove that happy endings
aren't obsolete.

_ Guido « Morris and Vincent
Cardworthy are cousins and best
friends. The early part of the book
rushes through Guido’s courtship of
Holly Sturgis, a woman who is
beautiful, perfect and inscrutable.

The core of the story is Vincent”s
love life. After a series of affairs
with vapid blonde WASPs, whom
Holly aptly labels “Vincent’s
vacuous no-shows,” Vincent meets
Misty Berkowitz at her office at the
Board of City Planning. ‘

It's love at ﬁrst sight for him but
she reacts with a series of snarls,
and they launch into one of the

the songs are shorter in length, ‘Yes
has not sacriﬁced the intricate
coordination and complexity that
has always distinguished its music.

On “Future Times," the ﬁrst
song, Anderson's high, clear voice
elevates the music into a lofty
fantasy, while Wakeman’s ﬂuid
synthesizer work adds a rich
sweetness.

“Don’t Kill The Whale” has a
funky ﬂavor contributed by White’s

steady drums and Squire's lively.

bass. The important message is
evident as Anderson sings, “In a
moment of love, they will die for
their grace. Don’t kill thewhale.”

The next cut, “Madrigal,” is
distinguished by Wakeman’s harp-
sicord, adding a crisp edge to the
total sound. “Release, Release”
follows as a gripping rocker
highlighted by V White’s strong,
lively work with the sticks. ‘

In “Arriving UFO,” Yes offers a
taste of galactic-‘style rock. The
coordination of synthesizers and
keyboards, the . interplay of a
thousand sounds, make the ﬁnal
product breathtaking. Few musi-
cians have ,a knack for such
coordination.

In- “Circus of Heaven” Ander-
son's expressive voice illuminates a
story of a fantasy while Howe’s
mandolin adds sweetness.

In another vein, “Onward” is a
pretty, melodic ballad. Yes hasn’t

funniest one-sided love affairs since
lgnatz Mouse ﬁrst slugged Krazy,
Kat with a brick.

“Happy All the Time” is about the
interactions of Guido, Vincent,
Misty and Holly. There are no great
events in the plot, only a continuous
growing process via a series of small
events that have no importance in
themselves.

Colwin creates a vivid and
delightful character in Vincent. He
is, as Misty decides, a good
person—-“The good do not neces-
sarily have to maintain morality,
they are born with it, while people
like Misty, who were not, had to
strive mightily for goodness. From
Vincent, Misty learned that good-
ness and stupidity were -not
necessarily linked."

Colwin’s adage that ‘ ‘Vincent did
not judge: Vincent enjoyed”
applies to the author as well.
Colwin delineates her characters by
showing, and she's at her best with
Vincent and, to a lesser degree,
Guido. Misty, however, whose
personality is unpleasant, has to be

made a habit of personal love songs,

but the quality of ‘ ‘Onward, ’ ’ belies

their inexperience with the style.
“Tormato” closes with “On The

Silent Wings of Freedom,” one of

Yes’s most ambitious pieces and a
true musical experience. The lyrics

explained to make her likable, to
understand what Vincent sees in
her. And Misty does not come
‘across with the same intensity that
he does. lt’s obvious that Colwin
doesn't feel the same affection for
Misty. '

by Anderson and Squire make fine
poetry:

On the silent wings of Freedom/

Where I offer myself midst the
balancing of the Sun.

Yes has a new album “Tormato," "hitting the charts. The grop conslss of (let A

Holly, too, doesn’t surface. It
isn’t until thevend of “Happy All the
Time” that she becomes more than
a store mannequin, but since she’s
used as aminor character, she does
not weaken the book. When the

‘inner side of Holly is revealed, as

insecure as the other three, Colwin
does her job skillfully.

“Happy All The Time” is witty '

and light, satiric and believable.
And, best of all, it’s a romantic book
by an author who is not afraid to
write about happiness.

Panthrs Soar Oer Eles

By BOB LABRIOLA
pm News Staff Writer

CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.—T o
borrow a verse from the gospel
according to Chuck Noll, “What-
ever it takes.”

Evidently, what it took was only
two quarters of offense for the Pitt
Panthers to defeat Boston College,
32-15, Saturday and run their record
to 4-0. '

Everything went according to
form when the game began. As
usual, the ninth-ranked Panthers
chose to have the wind at their backs
rather than receive the opening
kickoff. As usual, the Eagles
fumbled the ball on the first play
from scrimmage—Dave Logan
recovered—and set the Panthers up
at the 27-yard line. And as usual,
Pitt was unable to put a touchdown
on the board on its first offensive
possession and settled for a Mark
Schubert 21-yard ﬁeld goal.

After the ensuing kickoff, the
Eagles proved to the crowd of
21,673 that there is more than one
way to turn the ball over. Freshman
quarterback Dennis Scala, starting
in place of injured Jay Palazola, had
his first pass of the afternoon picked
off by JoJo Heath, who returned it
37 yards to the Eagle 11-yard line.
Boston College had run four plays
and turned the ball over twice, and a
rout seemed inevitable.

Two plays later, Rick Trocano ran
11 yards for the touchdown to give
Pitt a 10-0 bulge, and the fans began
to consider going home to watch the
second half of the Texas-Oklahoma
game on television.

The Eagles made the Panthers
work a little for the next score by
holding onto the ball long enough
for John Cooper to punt to the Pitt
44-yard line.

“A little" was all Pitt really had
to work since the Eagle defensive
backswere giving Gordon Jones a
10-yard cushion on every route in
order not to surrender a long pass.
Quicker than you could say, “Park
the car in Harvard yard,” Pitt had a
first and goal at the Boston College
six.

The Panthers took themselves out
of that prime scoring position with
peualties—illegal motion and. in-
eligible receiver downﬁeld—and
again settled for Schubert’s 32-yard
ﬁeld goal.

With less than ﬁve minutes
remaining in the period. Boston

Bradshaw

By The Associated Press

Terry Bradshaw’s pinpoint pass-
ing. blended with 104 yards rushing
to Franco Harris, carried the
unbeaten Pittsburgh Steelers to a

-31-7 victory over the Atlanta

College brought the fans to their
feet with its initial ﬁrst down. The
fact that an offsides penalty against
Pitt moved the sticks didn't stop the
fans from cheering ‘wildly.

The rejoicing was short-lived;
Boston College was forced to punt,

Falcons yesterday in a National
Football League game.

Bradshaw, showing no ill effects
ﬁom a knee injury sustained the
week before, hit 13 cf 18 attempts
for 231 yards, ran 6 yards for one

and 13 plays later the ball had
moved_75 yardsfrom where JoJo
Heath fielded Cooper’s punt.
Rooster Jones’s 1-yard burst
accounted for the touchdown, and
the lead grew to 19-0. The game
was but 18 minutes old.

John Stallworth for another.
Falcon quarterback Steve Bart-
kowski was sacked four times and
intercepted twice by a Pittsburgh
defense that lost a shutout with 2:03

left to play when Bartkowski hit-.

Wallace Francis with an 11-yard
touchdown pass.

Fred Steinfort missed ﬁeld goal
tries of 34 and 31 yards as Atlanta
fell to 2-4 on the season, while
Pittsburgh climbed to 6-0, the best
start in the 46-year history of the
Steeler franchise.

While Harris, who rushed 20
times, surpassed the 100-yard mark
for the first time of the season,
backﬁeld mate Rocky Bleier scored
a pair of touchdowns on runs of 8
and 2 yards.

Bradshaw’s 6-yard scoring run
came with 59 seconds left before
halftime and helped the Steelers to
a 17-0 intermission lead.

in the third quarter, Bradshaw’s
70-yard ‘pass to Stallworth, set up
Bleier’s 2-yard scoring run.

’-?-99%"-'rZ°9'a""

“We scored 19 points real quick,
and then we let down,” said head
coach Jackie Sherrill. “In the
second and third quarters, we did
zero offensively.”

The only movement the Panthers
were able to achieve during that

Stallworth’s 11-yard touchdown
reception gave Pittsburgh a 31-0
lead 3:08 into the final‘ period.

On the first series of the game,
the Steelers drove from their
12-yard line to the Atlanta 3, before
Bradshaw threw a pair of incomple-
tions and Roy Gerella kicked a
21-yard ﬁeld goal. ‘

It was a costly drive as the
Steelers lost tight and Bennie
Cunningham, when he sustained
knee ligament damage after a.
22-yard reception. 1

Early in the second quarter,
Steinfort missed a 34-yard field goal

— try, and the Steelers followed with

an 80-yard touchdown march that
included a 37-yard pass reception

by Lynn Swarm and ended with

Bleier’s 8-yard run. A

Bartkowski and Bradshaw each
lost fumbles midway through the
second period, but before the half
was over Bradshaw guided the

Steelers on a 61-yard scoring drive‘

that ended with his 6-yard keeper.
Before -Bradshaw’s run, the

time was the steady flow of’

substitutes both offensively and
defensively. Before the half was
over, Sherrill had used over 40 of his
players. One of the more surprising
substitutions involved Lindsay De-

‘Steelers gained 20 yards on two

ﬁeld goal try in the third quarter,
Pittsburgh followed with another
80-yard march, capped by Bleier’s
2-yard run. '

After Stal1worth’s fourth-quarter
touchdown, Atlanta got a pass
interference call against Mel Blount
that gave the Falcons first and goal
at the 1-yard line. But Bubba Bean
lost a fumble on a third-down
plunge.

The Atlanta touchdown capped a
46-yard drive that included a
17-yard reception by Billy Ryck-

man, who led Atlanta with five -

catches for 88 yards.

Blount intercepted a Bartkowski
pass at midfield just before
halftime. Steeler linebacker Loren
Toewes had another interception in

quarter.

laney replacing Trocano with 6:30 to
play in the ﬁrst half.

“We switched quarterbacks to
give Ricky some time to collect
himself,” said Sherrill. “I thought
he’, could do a little better, so I let
him look at it from the sidelines for a

- while.”

During that while, Pitt’s defense
suffered its first lapse of the
afternoon when Scala hooked up
with Paul McCarty on a 41-yard
touchdown pass with 34 seconds left
in the half.

The third quarter had Boston
College throwing powder puffs at

the Pitt defense, while the Panthers
countered by ﬁring feathers at the
Eagles. The two teams combined
were as offensive as an 80-year-old
nun. I

The fourth period—yawn—was
patterned after the third quarter
until Eagle head coach Ed Chlebek

gambled on a fourth-and-six from ,

his own 41-yard, line. To entertain
hopes of anything but beating the
spread, Boston College had to quit
exchanging punts with Pitt and get
some points on the board.

Chlebek ordered the ball snapped
to Dan Conway, theblocking back in
the punt formation, who attempted

Spikers Finish Fifth

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer
It could have been fatigue. It
could have been overconfidence.
Whatever it was, it probably cost
Pitt’s women’s volleyball team 7a
chance to win its own Womenis
Invitational Tournament.‘
Following a grueling‘ Friday
night of competition, the Panther-

ettes faced Indiana‘ (Pa.) early ‘

Saturday morning. Pitt won the
ﬁrst game handily, 15-2, but then
just fell apart, losing games two
and three, 16-14 and 15-11. The
loss forced Pitt to play a tough
Maryland team in the ﬁrst round of
championship competition, instead
of Penn State, who they eventually
defeated for ﬁfth place, 15-6 and
15-8. L . - _

“I think ‘that it was overconti-
dence,” head coach’ Mike Hebert
said. “After winningthat first
game by such a wide margin, we
just lost our concentration.”

Indiana‘ ultimately placed last in
the 16-team field. _

The Pantherettes started play
Friday night against Rutgers, the
eventual tournament champion.
Pitt lost the first game 15-11, but,
spurred on by the aggressive play
of ‘Paula Olsen and ‘Ingrid Mueller,
won the next two, 15-11 and 15-12.

Rutgers won the championship
Saturday night against last year’s

champion, Temple, 15-12, 9-15 and 1

15-13. '_ E

Following the win over the
Scarlet Knights, Pitt faced SUNY-
Buffalo and easily won both games
by the score of 15-5. Pool play was
completed with the upset loss to
I.U.P.

Pitt entered championship play
along with Rutgers, Edinboro,
Delaware, Maryland, Penn State,
Temple and Georgetown. Pitt
faced Maryland in the quarter

ﬁnals -and played tough right down
to the last point of the last game.

The Pantherettes won the first
game 15-8 and then lost the second
game 17-15.
match-deciding‘ game, Pitt fell
behind early, 6-0, but fought its
way back to 10-10.
didn’t'have enough strength left to
pull the game out, losing ‘15-12.

Maryland ‘wound ‘up third in the ’

competition, losing to Temple in
the semifinals and‘ defeating
Georgetown for third place.

After the Maryland‘ game, the
Pantherettes knew that they could
do no ‘better than ﬁfth place, but

they played as if each game was for

the title. Pitt embarrassed
Delaware 15-1, 15-1, and ‘then beat
Penn State to take ﬁfth-place
honors. Mueller once again
showed her strength, spiking ‘balls
left and right throughout those two
matches. Andra Pletz also did her
part in keeping the Pantherettes
among "the top ﬁve teams.

Junion co-captain Cindy Cham-
bers sat out the tournament with an
ankle injury and that deﬁnitely
didn’t‘ aid Pitt’s title chances.
“However, even without Cindy, we
should have placed higher,”
Hebert said. “We just lost our
concentration andended up in a
bad bracket, having‘ to face
Maryland right away.”

Hebert was impressed’ with the
tournament. *

“The crowds were pretty good

and the caliber of competition was ‘

excellent.” _ g
The Pantherettes will travel to
Slippery Rock Wednesday for a
dual match with the Rockets, who
placed ninth here this weekend.
"Pitt _will be at the Penn‘ State
Invitational Friday and ‘Saturday
along with many of the same teams
that competed at the Pitt tourney.

to run for the ﬁrst down. Pitt’s
Mark Reichard quickly diagnosed
the play, and Conway was stopped a
yard short of his destination.

Chlebek had hoped a score would
result from his gamble, b__ut it was
the Panther offense awakening
from hibernation that did the
scoring. Thirteen plays later,
Rooster ‘Jones scored his second
touchdown to put Pitt on top, 26-7.
Jones carried six times for 15 yards
on the drive and used his speed to
turn the corner for the ﬁnal two
yards and the six points.

The Panther defense turned the
ball right back to the offense when
Mike Balzer intercepted a Scala
pass at the Pitt 39-yard line.
Trocano returned thefavor on the
next play, however, when Mike
Mayock picked one off intended for
Ralph Still. On the exchange,
Boston College moved from its own
14-yard line to the Eagle 46-yard
line. i ‘

Once again the defense rose to
the occasion and turned the ball

over, this time on downs at the Pitt
27-yard line.

The Panthers went 73 yards on
seven plays for the ﬁnal Pitt score of
the afternoon and increased the
lead to 32-7. On third-and-13 from
the Boston College 29-yard line,
Trocano sent ‘Gordon Jones on a
straight ﬂy patternand laid the ball
in the right spot for the touchdown.

“On that play, they had single
coverage on me and the ﬂanker,”
said Jones. “It was easy.”

Bucknell Bests Booters    

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team dropped
another _disappointing ‘ one-‘goal
road decision Saturday when it lost
to Bucknell, 1-0. The loss dropped
the Panthers’ record to 3-4; three of
the four losses have been decided
by one goal.

Pitt dominated the game until
Bucknell scored on a penalty kick
with 20 minutes remaining. The
penalty took place when Bucknell
made a cornerkick to the middle,
where senior striker Mark Schio-
witz headed the ball toward the
goal. Schiowitzs’ shot was a sure
goal until Panther Mark Nigh used
his only‘ alternative and swatted the
ball away. Nigh was called for a
handball (within the 18-yard line)‘,
and the penalty kick was good. The
Panthers were unable to put any of
their scoring opportunities to use
and the ‘game ended a 1-0 Bucknell
win. '

The Panthers displayed good
passing ‘and ‘ball control, however,
dominating the shots on goal by a
17-7 margin. Three Panther shots
came within feet of the net‘.

from Tim Pearson in the middle,

and ‘hit shot went just wide. In the '

seco_nd'half Tissue tookthe ball
unassisted from 25 yards out and

Another Panther opportunity,

came when Mark Nigh dribbled
around ' three Bucknell defenders
and ‘barely missed tying ‘the score.

The majority of action occured at
the Bucknell goal. The Panthers
were so dominating that Pitt goalie
John Bonessi faced only‘ seven
shots all day. ‘ ‘

“Pitt has a good solid ball team,
although they have trouble with the
ﬁnishing ‘touches, which is some-

thing our team is lacking ‘in also,” ,

said Bucknell head coach Craig
Reynolds. “Pitt supports well and
moves good as a unit.‘

be decided by one ‘goal, as it was
last season,” he added. “It was
just unfortunate that the penalty

game.”

College Saturday.

CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.—Intensity.

With the season four weeks old, the Pitt Panthers
_have recorded the same number of unimpressive vic-
tories and face Notre Dame-and Florida State the
next two weeks. After each of the wins, headrcoach
Jackie Sherrill has lowered his head and spoken
about the same element missing from the Panther
performance. a

Intensity.

“Intensity is really just going out and playing with
emotion,” said Rick Trocano. “Personally, if I
don’t play with intensity, I don’t play as well. - He
(Sherrill) can sense it, and then he takes me out and
lets me get my head together.” '

. With 6:30 left in the first half, Sherrill’s senses had
decided to replace Trocano with Lindsay Delaney.

’ To that point, Pitt had scored 19 points on its first

four possessions and then suddenly went into an of-
fensive coma.

On Pitt’s ﬁfth possession of the game, which was
also Trocano’s last of the first half, the Panthers
took over on their own 43-yard line and marched to
the _Boston College 18 before the drive stalled.
Trocano had hit on seven of 1118 first 11 pass attemp-
ts, but misfired on five in a row, and Sherrill decided
the offense needed a change. On fourth-and-five
during that drive, Sherrill disdained three points and

Firstancl Goal

By BOB LABR/OLA

ordered a pass to Gordon Jones. The pass fell in-
complete, and the Panthers came away with nothing
from inside the Eagle 20-yard line.

It is easy to understand Sherrill’s decision at the
time. Pitt already had settled for field goals on two
occasions when a touchdown was what the Panthers
should have had. ' '

An early turnover gave Pitt the ball on the Boston
College 27-yard line. The Panthers settled for Mark
Schubert’s field goal, and two costly penalties on the
next possession—after Pitt had a first-and-goal at the
Eagle 6-yard line—forced another field goal. With
the talent the Panthers can put on the field—and
playing against a team that is weak at best—the score
should have been 21-0. Instead, Pitt led, ~13-0.

Intensity.

Delaney was unable to get anything going in the
final half of the second period; Trocano started the
second half for.the Panthers and the offensive ‘im-

potence continued. Pitt ran only eight plays in the _

 

  Jackie Sherrill   lntensel y Seeking Missing Pitt lngriedient

period—not including two punts by Joe Gaspar-
ovic—and recorded only one first down. ,

It is ridiculously obvious to say the Panthers will
not be able to afford these severe offensive lapses
during the upcoming two Saturdays. Playing Notre
Dame in South Bend is no picnic; only so much.can

be expected of any defensive unit. The offense has to’

move the ball to at least give them a breather.

Florida State brings a high-powered offense into Pitt '

Stadium in two weeks; coaches can boast about

. defense all they want, but the most effective way to
‘beat a high-scoring team is at their own game.

The Panthers have not been able to muster more
than two quarters of consistent offense in any of the
four games this season. Sherrill seems to think the
problem lies with a lack of intensity, or emotion, if
you prefer. . ‘

“These games ‘are tough to play,” said Trocano
Saturday. “The team plays good enough to win.
The people on this team are winners, and that’s the
way we approach the game. ’

“A team can play without intensity and win
because of its talent and be a good team,” added
Trocano. “But the same team won’t be a great one
unless it plays with intensity.” 2 -

Evidently, Sherrill believes he has the makings of
great team." So do a lot of other people.
