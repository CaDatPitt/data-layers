Bills Propose Reducing
Drinking Age to l8, l9

HARRISBURG AP -- Two more
proposals to reduce Pennsylvania's
drinking age reached the House
floor yesterday.

‘One would cut the minimum age
from 21 to 18 and the other--a
backup in case the first bill
fails--would permit drinking at 19.

“I think we've got a real good
chance this time," said Rep.
Charles Volpe. R-Lackawanna.

posaL
Last June. an 18-year-old
drinking amendment failed by

122-60 in the House and a follow-up
bid for 19-year-old drinking went
down 97-84.

The legislature passed a long list
of bills last year extending the
privileges of 18 year olds but
drinking was purposefully omitted.

“The way we've got it now, an
'18-year old can own a bar but he
can't drink in it," said Rep. Joseph
Sullivan, D-Philadelphia. minority
chairman of the ‘House Liquor
Control Committee. “It's ridicu-
lous."

The committee voted 8-4 to
release both bills to the House

Energy Shortage
‘, Blacks Out Pgh’s
Annual Light Up

AP---Pittsburgh's annual
Christmas spectacular--the lighting
of 60 downtown office buildings to
herald the holiday season has been
cancelled this year because of the
national energy crisis.

The Building Owners & Managers
Association, BOMA, which spon-
sors the Light Up Night event said
that although Pittsburgh has an
ample supply of power. it believes
the cancellation “would be a
meaningful gesture to the rest of
the nation whose energy situation
is far more critical..."

“it seemed unfair to areas of the
country which face real energy
problems for us to consume power
needlessly." said a BOMA spokes-
man.

During the event in the past, 15
million square feet of office space.
major department stores, small
retail establishments. hotels and
apartments were illuminated si-
mulataneously in the triangle
section downtown. at the conflu-
ence of the Allegheny and
Monongahela Rivers.

The scene has been the subject of
numerous photographs and ap-
pears commonly on Christmas
greeting and post cards.

The practice began in 1960.

floor.

Both measures would be effec-
tive next January I. Even if the
House approves one of them,
however, it is unlikely the Senate
would take action before next year.

There was little debate on either
bill.

“The kids in my district, they
don't care." said Rep. Max
Pievsky. D-Philadelphia. “They
live right on the Jersey border and
they've got it."

New Jersey and New York
permit drinking by 18-year-olds.
Many Pennsylvania lawmakers
pushing for the lower drinking age
claim Pennsylvania youths are
dying in automobile accidents
because they must drive to other
states to drink.

Volpe said he feels his 18-year-

.old bill has a chance to pass this

time because of the relatively
narrow 97-84 vote against it four
months ago.

Bill Encourages Pa. Practice

BY MITCH BERRY

A bill forcing Medical School
graduates to repay their full state
subsidy if they practice out of state
will be introduced in the Senate
this week.

Senator Patrick J. Stapleton
(D)-Indiana, is proposing the
legislation.

Each year the State subsidizes
Pitt’s Med School approximately
$4,400 for each student. Under the
new, bill’s provisions the student
must repay the subsidy within 20
years if he does not practice in
Pennsylvania.

However. if the Med School
graduate practices or interns in
medically needy areas of the state,
the subsidy payment would be
erased within five years. For those
‘practicing elsewhere in Pennsyl-
vania, the subsidy would be cleared
in ten years.

According to a story published in
Saturday's Pittsburgh Press. Sena-
tor Stapleton noted that only 417 of
the 963 graduates in the state's
Medical Schools, (42%) were
interning within Pennsylvania.

3-year Auto Headache

“That return for the investment the
state makes in their education just
won't do." he said.

However, the percentages for
Pitt’s Med School are higher than
the overall state ﬁgures. \

According to a report published
last year by the Commonwealth's
Office of the Budget. Pitt graduates

-‘represent 17% of the total number

of physicians practicing in the
state, though Pitt only produces
12% of the state’s Medical School
graduates.

The report further pointed out
that 75% of Pitt’s medical alumni
for the last 20 years are still
practicing in the immediate
western Pennsylvania area. The
report also said 65% of Pitt's 1973
graduates interned in Pennsylvania
hospitals.

The proposed bill has been
greeted with very little reaction so
far. The Administration of Pitt’s
Med School is making no com-

ments until the bill ‘is studied.

Renovation of Tubes Starts Nov. 1.

DPPA--Renovation of the Liberty
Tubes is scheduled to begin
November 1 with the outbound
tunnel closing first for approxi-
mately 18 months, according to
Pennsylvania Department of Trans-
portation (PennDOT) spokesmen.

After it reopens, the inbound
tunnel will close for another 18
months. Including the building of a
south portal interchange. the
project is scheduled to last four
years. until June 1. 1977. As a
preliminary move. the P.J.
McArdle Roadway to Mt. Washing-
ton is now being repaired and
resurfaced.

According to Harold Norris, of
Port Authority Transit (PAT), only-
deviations in bus routes heading
out of the city will be necessary
.when the outbound tunnel closes.

Buses will detour up the
McArdle Roadway to Merrimack
St. and onto Saw Mill Run Blvd. to
get to West Liberty Ave. Buses
headed for areas along Rt. 51 will
take New Arlington Ave. to Knox
Ave.. turn onto Bausman and
proceed down to Saw Mill Run.

Norris expected no major delays
and said no new time schedules will
be printed.

For commuters who drive,
PennDOT has listed one ‘official
detour while the outbound tunnel is
closed: Grant St. to the Penn
Lincoln Parkway West. over the
Fort Pitt Bridge. take the exit on
West Carson St. to the West End
Circle. and proceed to Rt. 51 at the
south end of the Liberty Tubes.

Other possible routes include

Pitt '5 Community Program

Enjoys Record Enrollment

BY TOM VERBISH

"The Community Educational
Services (CES) program has
provided a convenient opportunity
for students. who would not
otherwise have done so to continue
their educations." said Dr. Robert
W. Comfort. associate dean of the
School of General Studies (SGS).

“Attendance had been leveling
off at Pitt’s evening classes in

Oakland when the Mt. Lebanon
School District approached us
about using their facilities for the
off-campus program we were
planning in South Hills.

"We had an initial figures of 77
registrations for our first year in
the South Hills. Today the
enrollment figure for the present
fall term alone is 829." said

(Contimuvl on Par/e 7)

Banksville Rd., Brownsville Rd.,
and Streets Run Rd.

PennDOT. under pressure from
local politicans and groups. is
currently reconsidering its plans.
No definite changes have been
made yet. but there is a possibility
that the one open tunnel may be
used to carry traffic in the direction
of peak flow of traffic during the

[rush hours. 1

Faculty ‘reaction, however, . is
generally negative. One doctor in
the Department of Medicine said
the bill showed “very narrow
thinking." He pointed out that the
State subsidy funds account for a
very small percentage of the money
the Med School receives each year,
“I think it is unfair that the
students should have to serve the
State in this way." -

He added. ‘‘If all of the states in

the union did this we would get all_

of our own graduates and none.of

1

those from other states. I don't see .

where the state would come out
ahead."

Similar remarks were echoed by
a faculty doctor in the Department
of Microbiology who referred to
Stapleton’s statements saying,

“There is a fallacy in his thinking.” ‘

His main concern was the bill
might drive out Pennsylvania

residents who were eligible to get -

into other medical schools.
“Why should students enroll in

State med schools when they can_

go out of state where subsidy
provisions are not as strict. The
result of this might be that we
would perhaps have less able
people." he said.

The reaction of some of Pitt’s
Med students also hinted that

reaction to the bill would be very ‘

negaﬁve.

One representative reaction to- ‘

the proposed bill was: ‘‘I don’t
think the bill is fair because I don't
think the State should have this
means of controlling where a
student can intern, even if it is for
the good of the state.”

The same student felt more
students would enroll in out-of-
state schools to avoid the expensive
penalties for out-of-state practice‘.

Kissinger, Le Duc Tho
Awarded Nobel Prize 

OSLO. Norway AP--U.S. Secre-
tary of State Henry Kissinger and
North Vietnamese Politburo mem-
ber Le Duc Tho were awarded the
1973 Nobel Peace Prize yesterday
for their efforts to officially end the
Vietnam war.

Kissinger and Tho defeated 45
other accepted candidates, in-
cluding President Nixon, President
Tito of Yugoslavia and 10 inter-
national organizations.

The prize was about $120,000
and will be shared equally between
the two winners.

The Nobel committee chairman,
Mrs. Aase Lionaes, a judge and
member of Parliament, announced
the decision after the five-member
cgmmittee reviewed the candidates
for 2‘/2 hours.

Kissinger, 50, is the 16th
American to win or share the peach
prize since it first was awarded in
1901.

The last American winner was
Norman E. Borlaug, who deve-
loped a new type of high yield grain
for use in under developed
countries.‘ He won the prize in
1970.

Le Duc Tho is the first Asian to A 8

win the prize.
The prize has been shared by two
individuals 11 times previously.
No Nobel Peace Prize was
awarded last year. as has happened
on 18 occasions since 1914.
Chancellor Willy Brandt of West
Germany won the last prize in 1971

for his reconciliation policy toward '

Communist Eastern Europe.

“As long as there are men and"
women there will be rape,” stated
Sgt. John Flannigan of the Sexual
Assault Squad in the Pittsburgh
City Police Station.

If that statement purports the
inevitable, then institutions and
individuals must learn to live with-
the 'reality of rape. Facts and
truths must’ replace myths and
subjective reasoning as the lens to
view the crime. The distorted

Riape-Myth vs.  Reality  

image of rape has harmed the
innocent and protected the guilty.

Open discussion of rape as an
issue in the” women’s movement
has provoked scattered awareness
and acknowledgment of the crime.
Shame and responsibility tradi-
tionally assigned to women by the
myths is shifting from thelvictim to
the assaulter.

conscious of the rape experience.

‘Sgt. Flannigan reported, “Detec-

tives in the Sexual Assault Squad
are special and sensitive to the
problem.” .

Rape squads cdmposed solely of
women are also being added to
some police staffs to counsel
women. '

Rape is a traumatic experience,
said Dr. Betsy Rogoff of the
Student Health Services. Even
under the best of circumstances it
is difficult and painful to talk about.
Victims may feel female policemen
are more sensitive and, appreciative
of the experience.” '

Sgt. Flannigan though, contends ’

gender makes no difference, “We
(the policemen) are here to. serve
the people and suppress crime.”

The awareness education brings
to police and other institutions is
also needed in individual women.
Women must become aware of the
danger in not reporting rapes.

“Any woman who is attacked
and fails to report it to the police is
encouraging the criminal to violate
another woman. Most rapists are
repeaters. In the last analysis the
rapist hates women. His crimes
against them will become progres-
sively more violent, until he
reaches the ﬁnal crime---murder,”
said Pittsburgh Police Superinten-
dent‘ Robert«Colville.

Women must not only be taught
to report rape, they must learn how
to report the crime «in the most
effective manner. This maximizes
the possibility of capturing the
assaulter and lends credence to the
woman’s story. ’

Women should not delay calling
police; she should not wash or
change her clothes. A ,victim’s
appearance may show evidence of
force. Police often run lab tests on
garments. .

Properly reporting a rape may
facilitate the apprehension of the
assaulter. The data gathered may
also determine a geograpically
dangerous area which police may
be able to controlwith increased
car patrols.

However, reminds Inspector
James Heagy'of #4 Police Station,
“The police can’t protect an
individual 24 hours a day.”

_Correlating Heagy’s opinion with
Sgt. Flannigan’s that there will
always be rape, education is doing
an inadequate job. Women must

 National Plan Proposes Doubling Public

BY MICHAEL CLINTON

The Committee for Economic
Development (CED) has proposed
a plan to more than double
undergraduate tuition ‘charges at
the nation’s public colleges and
universities.

The CED, a business-oriented
research group composed mainly of
executives of major corporations
has been‘ a powerful force in the
nation's economic affairs since its
founding in 1942, says the New

between private and public col-
leges. '

It also says government subsidies
of higher education should not
beneﬁt all students equally, but
should be concentrated on those
who demonstrate greatest need.

Dr. Helen Wise, president of the'»
National Education Association
(NEA) called the proposal “an
attempt to roll back the clock in
higher education for lower and
middle income families.”

Someplace Special

education director of NEA added
“The move is one more way to

squeeze low cost, high quality

public higher education out of
business by forcing upper income
students into elite schools, and
lower and middle income students
into vocational and technical
schools.” «

The committee proposal parallels
recommendations made recently by
such organizations as the Carnegie

nation Board. All three groups
have called for massive increases in
aid to students of public institu-
tions based entirely on need.
David Smith, Treasurer of the
University _'of Pittsburgh said
however, “The proposal would
only affect the other state schools.

The recommendation is aiming at ,
states where tuition is down very

low. This excludes Pennsylvania

_-_strike which lasted from-1965-1970

‘recognized ' and contracts were

5 Very early during the strike, the
Farmworkers discovered that the
‘strike alone was an insufficient
“weapon. e Since there is a large
unemployed labor force in Califor-
nia, the growers were able to bring
in -"a significant number of
listrikebreakers to work in the fields.
.-jMany of these strikebreakers were
small children; others were ' un-
i‘-employed Mexicans and Mexican-
Ameriéans who desperately needed
*7‘: work. As ‘a result, the Farm-
“Fworkers turned to another tactic to
supplement the strike: a nation-
-- wide boycott of grapes. _

in large part to the work of United

at all is primarily the result of the

the Farmworkers are carrying out,

If the Teamsters have "indeed ’

agreed to nullify their contracts

it would be an important victory for
the United Farmworkers Union. It
would not, however, mean the end

will continue until the growers have
agreed to renew all of their
contracts with the UFW. ‘

BY RON SIEGEL

“Ancient Earth‘ was visited by
astronauts from another solar
system,” says Erich V‘on Daniken,
who spoke at the Carnegie Music
Hall last night. ' ' '

Von Daniken is the author of two
world-wide best—sellers, Chariots of
the Gods and Gods ‘From '_ Outer
Space," in which he cites holy books"
and physical remnants from two
thousand years ago and more as
proof of his ‘theories.

The stout, short 38 year-old
Swiss put the jam_-packed audience
into a position of possible belief by
explaining what could happen
when modern man sends a

spaceship to another galaxy where ,

a‘"planet’ exists withisomeliform of
life. He chose a planet where

primitive life, like that of the_Earth .

5,000 years ago existed.
“Naturally, these people will not
have seen anything‘ like ‘our
spaceships, landroversi, and other
modern equipment. They will

think of the visiting. earthmen as '

gods, and will incorporate the visit

‘ into their religions and recordings.

The most striking example from

. writings of the past,in his‘ opinion,

is the book of Enoch. In that book,
Enoch describes the visit of about
75 “astronauts”, _ giving details

such as names and specific chores

of the individuals.

He cites the Peruvian “plain of:

Nazca” as one of the more striking

physical proofs. “The only
apparent purpose this ﬂat area
could have served -was that of an
airport runway,” he said.

“Archaeologists shrug ityoff as

being Incan roads, but they-don’t ‘
go anywhere, and besides, the A

Incas didn’t know about the wheel.
The Incas made large drawings on

the plain which could only be seen . » '

from the air,” he added.
Von Daniken also points out facts

. and theorems that .didn’t_become

known until recently as further
proof of this theory. “The book of
Enoch contains such information as
the number of days in a year,” he
said. “The pyramids of Egypt are
also fascinating. First ofpall, there

weren't enough resources "around "'

tobuild them, and second, there

are _many— amazing .mathematical _
A andgeographical coincedenicesf I

“The heigh of the period of . .
Cheops lmultiplied‘-by_ a..‘thousand-'

million corresponds to theidistance

.from the Earth to the Sun. -A
srneridian d.rawn
pyramids divides the continents’

and oceans into two equal halves.
These people could not have known

‘ theseithings.”

What Von Daniken is theorizing

. is that visitors from space fertilized

what we now know as mankind

today. -. He has-come under heavy ’

criticism ‘for ‘his theories, but
nobody" is able to disprove them.
“If they do get proven in the

 “The prophet Ezekial tells of‘ a
trip in a spaceship in the Old A

Testament,’_' he said. “He claims

to have felt‘ himself being pushed

backinto-his seat during the ride,

which is common knowledge now,

but could not even have been
imagined back then." -V

Gomorrah also gives a good
description of a nuclear explosion,

falthough it wasin the“~words»~of

“The - story of "Sodom '_and‘'

people who had no comprehension

_ ofethie things we do now."

.‘.‘A more recent nuclear explo-I.
siontook place in Siberia in 1908,”
he added. The effect on trees and
wildlife in -' the. area is quite.

. ‘convincing that a nuclear blast took
 place.” ‘

The many, many cave drawings

of menwith helimetson -also are

cited by Von Daniken as proof.

' ' ' The advice women often receive is

that when confronted with rape to

relax and enjoy it. Alternative
actions have not been offered.

Women must assume the re-
sponsibility for self-protection.

Self-protection I does not just
mean self—defense. Judo and
karate are disciplines requiring a
great deal of. time and training
some women do not have available.

Common sense is the one thing
women do have at their disposal.’

Women should naturally be alert
to their environment. Oakland
ranks ﬁfth among the nine districts
of’Pittsburgh in reported rapes.

While walking down Oakland or
McKee Place. regard. the man
walking towards you as apotential
rapist even ifyou do recognize him.

Fifty per cent of rapes are
committed by acquaintances of the
victim.

If walking alone _at night, stay on
well-lighted streets. If‘ the
neighborhood is dark, walk down
the middle of the road where you
can get a better view. ‘

If you are attacked, scream. But
do not scream help. Give a blood
curdling cry of “Fire. Fire."

The shock value may scare the

potential rapist away. Do anything

to draw attention even to the point
of throwing something into‘ a
lighted window.

Criminals have a fear of
discovery. Light, noise, or an
extension of time may deter them-
from committing the act.

If you do ‘decide to defend
yourself and. areattacked from the

1 front, free your arms and clap or
punch at the. assaulter's eyes,
temples. mouth. nose, and right
under his ears. Or bite.‘ "

Scott Bartlett, noted West Coast film-maker, will be in Pittsburgh on
Thursday and Frida.y'(Ovct- 18 and 19) to conduct a special seminar

on electrovideographics, the largely unexplored area of images:
composed of film, video, and computer-controlled-and-a-ssembled

pictures. Bartlett will be appearing at the Film Workshop of the
Pittsburgh Film-Makers’ Association for two evenings, first to show

films involving electrovideographics (OFFON; MOON 1969; SER-

PENT;; and 1970), and then-to demonstrate how to work in the

medium with film and video cameras. Seminar members will be

able to discuss the subject with Bartlett on both evenings, after

seeing the- films, a_nd them, on Friday, participate in making a film- .
video-film. Admission to the Workshop will be $10 per person. The .
Workshop is located at 6118 Penn Circle South in East Liberty. . _'

Among the prizes Bartlett's films have won are the Grand
Prix at Oberhausen for OFFON, and invitation to the London film
festival for NOON 1969. Bartlett's films can be found’ in the collec-
tion of the Museum of Modern Art as well as CI number of European

Miss Jones: The Devil Made Her Do It»

BY JOHN SMITH

I hitchhiked downtown to see a
movie last Saturday afternoon. The
guy who picked me up seemed nice
enough [although he was a bit on
the heavy side] and started the
usual chit--do you go to school, etc.
He then asked me if I wanted to see
some magazines his friend gave
him and pulled out some 5'th rate
imitations of Playboy. “Do these
turn you on?”

“No, not really."

“I get all hot when I look at them.
I like stag filmstoo."

Of course I knew’ what was

happening, but not being one. to A
jump out of moving cars. I let him

talk until we _reached town.

“Would you like to ride around‘
' with me for a while?"

“No thanks. I'm just going up
here a little ways.”

“I think l’ll ride around and look
for sex or something.”

“Good luck." I hopped out on
Liber.ty'Ave. I thought later that I
should have?‘ told him to go the
Devil--The Devil in Miss Jones,
that is. '

The Devil in Miss Jones is the
current offering at the Liberty
Theatre, following the long run of
Deep Throat. As a rule I don’t do
movie reviews, much‘less porno
movie reviews. Miss Jones,

_ however is the exception to that

rule, because not only is it the best
porno “movie I’ve ever seen, but
probably one of the best movies to
come out this year.

The plot is easy to follow (as any
good plot should be). Justine
Jones (Georgina Spelvin) is a
dowdy spinsterish woman who has
never done anything in her life,
sexual or otherwise.’ So, one day
she kills herself, only to face a
gentleman at a reception desk for
heaven or hell. He informs her that
despite her siiiless life, she will

have to be sent to hell because she"

is a suicide. Eventually. though, it
is decided that this is unfair and the
man gives her a chance to go back
to earth and do something to merit
this drastic punishment. She
chooses to pujrsure a life of lust.
This she does after brief instruc-
tion by “the teacher" (Harry

’ Reains). After indulging in a series

of kinky acts with everything
from snakes to fruit to tribadism

and lesbian_ism in every imaginable ,

position, she returns reluctantly to
the man at the desk. She is
completely different now--worn
out, experienced. and ready for
Hell.

For her, Hell is a stark white room
with a man. Great! But no, he
couldn’t get it on if he wanted _to,
for he’s too distracted by flies that
only come out when his eyes are
closed. The camera _pans out as
Miss Jones masturbates furiously,
screaming, “I can’t‘ get off by

- myself.”End.
_Unfortunately, no

amount of
description could. do this movie

justice. It is perfect in every detail.
right down to the beautifully
manicured fingernails of the
women involved.‘ The director's
superb eye brings the film into the
class of the erotic rather than the
pornographic, even though the sex
is all sinfully hard-core.

Technically. Miss Jones has to be
the best film of its kind to date.
Excellent color and creativei(’some-
times shocking) camerawork makes

"WVU   Game Best

Performance Yet”

BY RON SIEGEL
SPORTS EDITOR

"Our team smelled the goal line_
Saturday." said Johnny Majors"
yesterday at the Pitt football
luncheon. “It was by. far the best
team effort to date."

Although busily preparing for this
weekend's Boston College game,

.Majors still-had plenty of com-

ments about the West Virginia
game. a g

.“The team played with more
confidence and poise that I could

i have anticipated at this time." he

said. “We had some sparks
before, but this is the first time we
put everything together."

‘ Majors brought‘ defensive tackle

l

Glen Hyde and center» Mike Carey
to the luncheon. “Carey played his

best" game ever,” said the mentor. —

“And Hyde has ,been one of the
most improved players on the
team.” ' "

Carey got into a few verbal
exchanges with Mountaineer mid-
dleguard Jeff Mervis. “We played
against each-other the last few
years," the redhead explained.
“He kept talking. the'who'le game.
but it ‘didn't amount to anything.”
_ Majors said that h the entire
offensive line played well. “Tony
Dorsett and Bill Daniels did a lot of
things on their own," he said, “but

it takes good blocking to set up.

How do you score against a
soccer team that has "all eleven men
playing defense? That was the
Panthers’ dilemma as they faced
the CMU Tartans at Skibo ﬁeld
yesterday. The Pitt team did
manage to score twice in the

I second half, thoughjand walked off

the field with their second victory
of the season. _ ' ‘

The Tartan defense had held Pitt
scoreless in the first half; although.‘
there were some Pitt threats in that

period. With seven minutes gone .

in the opening half, Joe Luxbacher
led a charge‘ upfield only to have

most of the things that they did."
He awarded the‘ game‘, ball to
offensive tackle Dave Wannstedt.

When Pitt was leading 21-14 in

the third quarter, the coaches up in
the booth reminded Majors that a
field goal would . serve
purposes--three points on the-
scoreboard, and a morale uplifter
for placekicker Carson Long.
i“We tried to get the ball into the
center of‘the field to set up an
attempt," siaid Majors, “but
Dorsett kept turning the plays into
touchdowns." _

Long converted - all five extra
points easily. and also kicked off
Pitt's strategy was to keep
the ball away from West Virginia's
deep receivers. ‘and Long did it
well. One kick resulted in a fumble

which Pitt recovered, but an offside ‘

nullified the play. ’ r
Majors also expressed satisfaction

with the punting of freshman Larry

Swider. “When the score was still

“It's not as if we never practice
shooting,” said Coach Bemis after‘
the game. “but we were playing on
a much narrower field than we are
used to and couldn’t work the ball
as -much as we like to."

Joe Luxbacher had a head shot at
the net but it was right into the
arms of the CMU’ goalie, and Jim

‘ Monhan just couldn’t catch up. to a"

missed head shot by a Tartan

defender, only to watch the ball-

roll out of-bounds past the CMU
goal. '

All in all, Pitt had thirteen shots’

on goal in the first half, but

couldn’t turn‘ one of them into a

score, but as futile as Pitt’s efforts
were to score, CMU’s efforts to
mount any type of offense was even
more so.

_ Five shots on goal by the
Tartans, one of them a missed
penalty kick by Peter Moses, did

not amount to much to anything,‘

and Bill Haines did not have a very
busy afternoon in notching another

g shutout to set a record for career

shutouts by “a Pitt goalie.

It was a dejected Panther team
that went back to the bench at the
end of the first half. “We just can't
score,"
Bemis tried to give them instruc-
tions for the second half of the
game.

The Cats returned to the field
with the wind at their backs and
found that the Tartans had

“Our punt returns are exciting the

referring to the fumbles land

Pitt's offense added a new
"dimension Saturday with- the
advent’ of the ﬂanker running the
football. Asked if he’ considered

Peter Moses of ;.CMU was a one
man team in a half marred by many
Pitt fouls and missed penalty kicks
by the CMU team. Moses dribbled
all around the Pitt upbacks, ‘but
could not ﬁnd the open man, and

being‘unable to take it in himself he i

lost the ball more than once to a
tough Panther defense.

The Cats‘ first score came as
John Murphy passed the ball to Joe
Luxbacher fifteen yardsiin front of
the CMU net and Joe sailed the ball
past the outstretched handsof the
Tartan goalie. Minutes later, Bob
Kohlmyerpassed the ball beyond a
CMU fullback to a waiting Bill Rex
who fired it into the net for Pitt’s
second and last goal of the game.-

Dan Straleyi” missed a golden
opportunity when the only person
between him and the goal was Bill
Haines, but the CMU forward shot
the ball right past the goal to end
the scoring threat.

g_“CMU is always tough at
home," said Coach Bemis after the
game which saw Pitt ‘almost
helpless to score in most of the
game. “We have played them to a
2-1 score an another 2-0 game the
last two times we've played them at

Bulino Does The MonsterMash 

BY VINCE DI NARDO

Mike Bulino isn't your ordinary run of the mill
‘monster’.

For beginners. he’s only 6-0, 190 pounds--not large
by monsters standards _and he’s happy-go—lucky as
anyone you would ever want to meet anywhere,
which is a mortal sin in horror circles.

But, put pads and a football helmet on Mike Bulino
and you’ve got yourself a real ogre--along the lines of
a .Lon Chaney Jr., Boris Karloff, and Vincent
Price--who fits perfectly into Johnny Majors 5-2 with
a monster man defense.

He is so good as his position, you could say “he

does the mash, he does the monster mash.” And, .

that he’s a gridiron smash!

-On last year’s hapless 1-10 team,
Bulino, a junior from St. Clair, Pa.,
was a strong safety. As it turned
out, he was the best defensive back 1
Carl DePasqua ‘had. But
admittedly, Bulino felt uncomfort
able on long pass coverage and
would rather have been closer to ’ V
the ball. So, when he heard Majors A
was going to have a_ ‘Monster
Back’, Bulino fell-- in love.

“I like being called a monster,” Bulino said
Tuesday in a very unfrightening manner, smiling
from ear to ear.’ “The word brings to mind someone
who is in complete control, annihilating everyone. I
think I’m a good man for the job.”

His defensive coach, Jackie Sherrill agrees 110 per
cent. '

“To be a good monster back, you’ve got to be
intelligent enough to diagnose the big play.” Sherrill
said. “You’ve got to have strenght and quickness
against the run and quickness and agility against the
pass.

“He gives 110 per cent on every play and is the
best I've seen at that position.” I

BULINO

Coming from a~man who played linebacker on two.

National Champions at Alabama, and whose been
around great defenses all his coaching life, the
“Bulino is super,” Sherrill added. “He loves, to
hit--there's no fault there.” ,'
HE LOVES TO HIT
Boy does Bulino like to hit. Just ask Georgia
running back Jimmy “The Golden Greek”
Poulos--Bulino met him in the season’s opener in

  
  
   
 

Athens; just ask /Northwestern quarterback Mitch
Anderson--he met Bulino in Evanston; just ask
Danny Buggs and Ade Dillon of West Virginia--
they’ll tell you. Ask the Pitt coaches--they love it.
“I like to hit," Bulino curtly said. “That's the way
I was brought up. When I was 12 years old, I was
playing tackle with the 16 year old kids. I feel that a
good hitter on the football ﬁeld will come to the top
and stand out in. the crowd. » 1
‘‘I’ve never been afraid to run into anybody," he
said, “I guess you could say I have no ‘fear factor’.”
A lot of Bulino’s success has come with the
insertion of the blitz into the Pitt defense. 'Baylor and
Tulane beat the blitz by running to the weak side, but
Northwestern and West Virginia weren’t that lucky.
Anderson had a hard time passing the ball--aside

from the rain--and West Virginia was crushed by it. ,

Bulino and the Blitz forced one crucial turnover at

WVU and put Dillon out with a shoulder injury. With -

Pitt leading 14-7 and WVU on the Pitt 8 yard line,
Bulino broke through to force a Dillon fumble. Later,
Dillon was hurt after completing a pass, forcing
Chuck Fiorante into action. The Mountaineers
weren’t quite the same without Dillon.

«.“When I hear my play called in the huddle,”
Bulino said, “the adrenelin starts to ﬂow and I get a
little more excited.”

BEAT BOSTON COLLEGE g
If the Panthers are to beat the Boston College

a Eagles this Saturday afternoon, Bulino will have to,

play a big role. And, if fate is kind to the Cats this
year, you know Bulino will have done well.

“These coaches came in here in January and told
us they were going to start rebuilding this year,”
Bulino noted. “I used to- get mad when I read that
Pitt didn’t h_ave~anygood players. We knew we had

. good players here. Majors put his confidence in us,
brought people in where he needed them, and
demandedperformance. As a result, I think we are a
good team.

“The main difference this year is that every game
is more important than the last. Last year we were
always looking for our ﬁrst win. Boston College is
foremost in mind now.”

When asked how such a happy kid could enjoy
being called a monster,/Bulino thought for a moment
and said, “Actually, I am totally different now than I
am on the field. In a game, I breathe heavy and the
whole works. Ihate the opposition. No, I don’t foam
at the mouth, but I’m like a Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde.

Dear Akadama Mama:

Dear Ms. President:

I’m more interested in Mama’s
Lib and Mama feels if you do right
by your Daddy, he’ll do right by you.
Now my Daddy, I treat him right.
When he comes dragging home at
night I fluff up his ego. Slip off his‘
shoes. Hand him his pipe. And head
for the Akadama wine. Forget those
tooty-fruity wines. They’re for boys,
not for my Old Man. So I’ get out my
Akadama recipe card and mix him
one of my love potions. You’d be sur-
prised how fine a Saturday can be
when you start it off with Akadama
Red and orange juice. And the sec-
ond best way I know to end the day
is with‘Akadama Red and cham-
