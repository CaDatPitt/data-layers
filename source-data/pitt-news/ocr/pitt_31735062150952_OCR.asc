As a,.curt—ain-raiser to the lggirgaiii
bill to be offered at Fo'rbes‘Frield‘ne:ct
Saturday, the Fresh on are scheduled
to t3'ke_.on‘ the almost invincible In-
diana Normal team. Thus far the
Normaliteﬂs have shown evidences of

, being «the strongest secondary scliiool

aggregatiion in the V\/est. In their
three games so far, they have’:aver:ag'ed
almost 100 points {per game,_~winning
"Over ”Bellefonte Aca_dem'y_ by

usually heavy squad for a prep. team,
outweighdng niany college teamsfthlat
have, appeared here. .The fact that
such men as, Kellogg of ‘Allegheiiy
High -and Sandiomire‘ or ~seheniey',
who were stars of the ﬁrstmwa-tor in
lgoal prep circles, are only second
string men in the Red ind. .._\V‘hite
backﬁeld, speaks for the calibe_r.o«f the
team. Prof. Kerr. has been _'clrlilling
mthe ‘yearlin-gs to the limit the past
twoweeks, so that they are -beginning
to Svll.O-W_S‘O1‘l’l*e -of their ‘latent class.

The W. & J. alumni rooters will be:

Murphy _has secured tickets, for four
complete sections and expects to dis
pose of all of them. ‘W. '& J.-is noted
for its splendid rooting at the foot-
ball games and the noiseimaking duel
on November 10 will be only second-
ary* in interest to the batile between
the opposing forces on the ﬁeld. The
fact that the teams will enter the
game evenly matched and that it is
"‘anybody’s game" will enhance the
interest a hundred per cent. The
eyes of the entire football world .will
be on Pittsblirgh that _day and the
team is all the more likely tO"‘come
through” if it has the support of ‘ev-
ery Pitt -man and woman who_ ca
get to the game. ‘ ‘_

After the game, it will be football
night at the Schenley Theater. Pitt
men should get their tickets for the
