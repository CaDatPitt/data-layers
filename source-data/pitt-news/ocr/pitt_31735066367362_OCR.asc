much, and there isn't any purpose
in it until it is properly or-

According to Sally Werner,

the petition ‘overcame party lines.’
“Students indicated that they

said Miss Werner. “There was
much enthusiasm."

Admissions to this group. ac-
cording to Kennedy’s plans, would
be determined by a battery of
rigid tests. The applicant would
have to be well-trained in the

service region, in addition to
technical or business knowledge.

Teaching Aids
Acquired as Part

Of Modernization
By ALLEN JOHNSON

T e a c h i n g machines are
among the several new de-
vices to aid teachers that the
School of Education has intro-
duced. These are compact ma-
chines covering about one

square foot of area and operating
on a question and answer system
which may be manipulated by the
students themselves.

These machines will not replace
teachers as the name might imply,
instead they serve as an aid to
the teacher.

Two of these machines were re-
cently acquired by the School of
Education as a part of a bigger
program to keep professors and
students up to date on the latest
advances in elementary and sec-
ondary school education.

The machine is designed tor use
by the gifted elementary or sec-
ondary school pupil. It provides a
convenient method of teaching
and testing the pupi1’s knowledge
by confronting him ﬁrst with_a
question, then having him answer
the question.

To check his answer, the stu-
dent then pulls the lever which
brings up the answer along with
the next question, and the pro-
cess is repeated again.

Besides the teaching machines
the School of Education has also
made new additions to the Cur-
riculum Materials Center on the
sixth ﬂoor by bringing the ele-
mentary systems of the entire na-
tion into one room.

This is a collection of curricu-
mm and teaching information
which includes representative ma-
terials from throughout the nation
as well as similar and more de-
scriptive materials from school
systems in the Tri-State area.

Also being developed in the
Center is a library of elementary
and secondary school textbooks
which give the prospective teacher
an opportunity to see and use the
tools that they will be working
with when they begin their career.

New Education Devices Introduced

   

TEACHING MACHINES are being used in the School of Education.
The machines present a question to the student, wait for an answer.
and then show the correct answer so that the student may see if
his answer is correct.

'TINY MEMORY UNIT
GUIDES GIANT ROCKETS
INTO SPACE

On this tiny drum, only four and one-half inches In diameter,
Is recorded all the significant data needed to direct a rocket
Into space.

As the rocket blasts skyward, the electronic computer, which

includes this small memory unit. begins to monitor the flight.

The computer continually correlates data on ﬂight progress
with data in the memory unit and makes course corrections
instantly.

The very small size and weight of this memory unit is an
achievement in itself. Yet other difﬁcult problems had to be
overcome—shock, prolonged vibration and extremely high G
forces. Only by using new materials and design techniques
were these problems solved. ’ I

 ,-Poe1ns contain Appeal,

 No ‘Maudlin Sentiment’

BY WILLIAM BENNETT
The art of poetry can be a very self-conscious one. Read-
ing the work of Allen Ginsberg and his anachronistic cohorts,
I am less outraged than embarrassed at their strained and
conscious efforts to force their art into the style expected of

them.

On the other hand, the least self-conscious poets in Amer-

ica -— the Editorial Page Lyricistsé

of the Metcalf genre —— are just
as embarrassing.» With them, ex-
uberance’has given way to mew-
ling, leaving one with the wish
that they’d keep their emotions
and impressions to themselves.

All of which brings me to Miss
Denise Levertov. In a new book,
“With Eyes at the Back of Our
Heads,” (New Directions, 74 pp.
hardback, $3.00) she proves that
a poet can still be enthusiastic
without drawing blushes from the
reader.

Poet Levertov

She is a poet —— Walt Whitman
and William Saroyan are two
others — who sing without gush-
ing; achieves clarity without dry-
ness; directness without pander-
ing. There is an intellectual ap-
peal in the poems, yet they have
avoided becoming perversely ob-
scure.

But Miss Levertov’s greatest
skill lies in her treatment of the
subject matter itself. Working
principally with reverie and nos-
talgia, she gives these emotions
a sharp objectivism that strips
them of sentimentalism and pre-
ciousness, leaving them simply
beautiful.

An example of this are the
ﬁnal lines of a poem entitled
“Seems Like We Must Be Some-
where Else:”

“And the train whist1e?«Who
invented that? Lonesome man,
wanted the trains to speak for
him.‘’.

Poem Translated
Also, as a forward to her poems,

Denise Levertov has given us her
translation of an old Toltec poem.
It reads in part:

“The true artist: draws out
all from his heart,/ works with
delight, -makes things with calm,
with sagacity,/ . . . composes his
objects. works dexterously, in-
vents,/ a r r a n g e s materials,
adorns them, makes them ad-
just.”

Miss Levertov is one of those
rare artists who lives to the pre-
face she chose; she has listened
well to the Toltec and carried out
his advice. '

HOW TO BEAT THE BEAT GENERATION

My cousin Herkie Nylet is a sturdy lad of nineteen summers
who has, We all believed until recently, a lively intelligence and
an assured future. Herkie’s father, Walter O. Nylet, is as every-
one knows, president of the First National Artiﬁcial Cherry
Company, world’s largest maker of artiﬁcial cherries for ladies’
hats. Uncle Walter had great plans for Herkie. Last year he
sent Herkie to the Maryland College of Humanities, Sciences,
and Artiﬁcial Cherries, and he intended, upon Herkie's gradu-
ation, to ﬁnd him a nice fat wife and take him into the firm as
a full partner.

Could a young man have more pleasing prospects? Of course
not. But a couple of months ago, to everyone’s consternation,
Herkie announced that he was not going into the artiﬁcial cherry
business. Nor was he going to stay in college. “I am,” said
Herkie, “a member of the Beat Generation. I am going to San
Francisco and grow a beard.”

Well sir, you can imagine the commotion in the family when
Herkie went traipsing off to San Francisco! Uncle Walter would
have gone after him and dragged him home, but unfortunately
he was right in the middle of the artiﬁcial cherry season. Aunt
Thelma couldn’t go either because of her old leg trouble. (One
of her legs is older than the other.)

‘Q

 

So I Went. I searched San Francisco for weeks before I found
Herkie living under the counter of at Pronto Pup ‘stand. “Herkie.
how are you?” I cried, looking ,z,listraugl1tly upon his tangled
beard, his corduroy jacket, his stricken eyes.

.“Beat,” said Herkie.

I offered him a Marlboro and felt instantly better when he
took it because when one smokes Marlboros, one cannot be too
far removed from the world. One still has, so to speak, a hold
on the ﬁner things of life-—like good tobacco, like easy-drawing
ﬁltration, like settling back and getting comfortable and enjoy-
ing a full-ﬂavored smoke. One is, despite all appearances, basi-
cally happiness-oriented, fulﬁllment-directed, pleasure-prone.

f‘Herkie, what are you doing with yourself 1”.’ I asked.

.“I am ﬁnding myself,” he replied. “I am writing a. novel in
the sand with a pointed stick. I am composing a. fugue for
clavier and police whistle. I am sculpting in experimental ma-
terials—like English muﬁ"ins.’!

.“And what doyou do for fun?” I asked. i

“Come,” he said and took me to a dank little night club
where men in beards and women in basic burlap sat on orange
crates and drank espresso. On a tiny stage stood a poet reciting
a free-form work of his own composition entitled Excema: The
Story of a Boy While behind him a jazz trio played 200 choruses
of Tin Roof Blues.

.“Herkie,” said I, “come home with me to the artiﬁcial cherries}!
“N 0,” said Herkie, so sadly I went home to tell Uncle Walter
the bad news. He was less distressed than I had feared. It seems
Uncle Walter has another son, a quiet boy named Edvorts, about
whom he, had completely forgotten, and today Edvorts is in
business with Uncle Walter and Herkie is beat in San Francisco,

and everyonelis happy.

And you too will be happy—with Marlboros, or if you prefer
an unﬁltered smoke, with Philip Morris. Try the brand-non

Another criticism often expressed in the- poll is that
ftoonfew students give any support to SG. SG members rec-
gnize this problem, but as yet’ littlehas been done about
willhe situation seems to be a vicious circle. Students will
give their support to SG_when SG begins doing something
them‘. But SG cannot do anything until it gets student
tWPP°Tt~. ’ ‘ I I   - ’

Alack of organization within SG was still another crit- '
 frequently voiced. When the new constitution ‘was
41 last year it was hoped that better organization in
;_ group ‘ would result. Instead, new problems have de-
ix oped, -for with all the subdivisions of SG, members now
‘« ve ‘less direct contact with each other. Since thepresent
 is a ‘new~one, perhaps ‘a little more time will solve this

diﬁiculty. V V A
*-“But will it take."just a little more time” to solve SG’s

sponsible members, will determine~this.

it does seijve. as an illustration
of one of the most peculiar facets

the‘ stock in ‘ trade vehicle of   V
nearly every comedian in the no .
world, ‘particularly ‘those who‘ are classed as “en-
tertainers.” Being a person who is often moved..to
wonderjust why people laugh, the humor of being
insulted ihasaoftenpset me to speculating.
‘Not Me ,—aj*H_im'  

‘Perhaps ‘Jonathan Swift was right when he ‘said
that thewinan who ‘is insulted is always. certain
the remark is meant for someone else. And since

it is fairly common knowledge that most people»

get a vicarious "pleasure out of seeing their fel-
lows’ discomf‘ort,>there is some credence_'to this.
After all, a great deal or humorous insults are'de~
livered to groups.“

" It is highly likely, then, that each man in,

derivgd great glee from the thought that the man

Little. didshe realizethat the thoughts of the man
those several seats away were identical to his.

This transfer of ridicule serves ‘a double pur-
pose; it notlonly allows the individual to enjoy
himself at what hefeels is his neighbor's expense,

‘it removes‘ the sting of embarrassment from him.

It makes him an exception to an unhappy rule.‘
Such exception-taking becomes apparent in ’a
case where a writer like Theodore Dreiser is

said by his editors to “love all mankind but“ hate“

and ezgpose the’ ‘hypocrisy of society.” Dreiser
may have fooled the editors into this paradox, but
he ‘failed to convince the reading public.’ His in-
sults‘ were too —specific’, they could not be‘trans1

JOHN MASON BROWN addressed the Midday audience last Wed-

that a writer must take into consideration when he begins his
work, and several things he must not take stock in.

words of Shakespeare’s King Lear, “(Every writer) must

Boaters Down Lock Ilaven
4-2 Behind Smith, Weiravch

By JOHN

FLEMING

The booters continued their recent victory surge by
dumping Lock Haven Saturday, 4-2, on the latter’s home

grounds.
Let by Pete Smith and Ed

Weirauch, the Panthers added

the fourth victory to their season record. So far this year the
Blue and Gold post a record of 4 wins, 5 defeats and 1 tie.

The first score for the Panthcrsﬁ

was a gift. Corky Cuthbert was
pressing the Lock Haven fullback.
The fullback tried a kick—back to
the goalie. but the attempt proved
fatal as the ball went into the
goal to give the Panthers their
first score;
Winning Goal
Lock Haven proved that they
were not beaten yet, as they came
back to tie the score at one apiece.
Ed Weirauch put the bootcrs
ahead again by scoring his first of
two goals on a pass from the left
wing. Damri Uawithya.
Cuthbert and Smith teamed
up to make the next score for
the Blue and Gold. Smith
passed the ball from the wing
position to the front of the goal
about ﬁve orsix yards out.
Cuthbcrt took over from there
to give the Panthers what
proved to be the game winning
goal.

Smith was also in on the final
tally for the Blue and Gold. This
time Smith assisted Weirauch
who scored from 15 yards out.

Fast Break

Lock Havens only goal came on
21 fast break play. The booters
were pressing the Lock Haven
squad. Suddenly a player from
Haven stole the ball and broke
away. The Panthers’ fullback had
been drawn in by the pressing
that the Cats were dishing out.
With the Panther defense com-
pletely out of position, Lock
Haven had little trouble scoring.

“We played the sort of game
where we Scored when we had_
to,” commented Coach Bemis.

“We wcren’t up for the game

as much as we should have been.

We should have scored more

than four goals but the ﬁeld was

too muddy and slippery for any
heavy scoring.

Romeo’s 13-1
Record Leads

In Yogi Race

Jack Smith has v i r t u ally
clinched his first yogi champion-
ship by running up a 10-4 card
last week. Scoop has a nine game
lead over the second place players.

After nine weeks of frustration
and constant harassment Marshall
Romeo came out on top with a
13-1 slate. He is making a strong
bid to ﬁnish third.

Tied with Smith at 10-4 this
week was Ted Colton who also
is ﬁnally living up to early sea-
son expectations. He has moved
above the .500 mark for the ﬁrst
time with this week’s picks.

Joanne “Speedy” Dolinar has
slowed down her early pace and is
again hitting her norm. She had
a 9-5 card to keep her .in the race
for the second spot.

Fred Cox and Consensus both
had 8-6 slates, while Jim Vaughn
pulled in with an unimpressive 6-8
record.

McCormick Scores 6-2 Win

Girls Display‘ Guts’ on Gridiron

By TED COLTON
The time, Friday, November 11;
the weather, cold; the place
Forbes Field; the scene, the
weirdest game of football played

this side of Hoboken, Hawaii.
‘The girls from McCormick and
Holland Halls shed their make up

and bobby pins, armed them-
selves with bubble gum, sweat
pants, sweat j e r s ey s, tossel

caps and tennis shoes and got
down to the business of football.
Who won? Well the ﬁnal score
read McCormick 6-Holland 2, but
both sides have to be credited
with a victory, for Forbes Field's
hallow tiers will not long forget
the crushing blocks, electrifying
runs and bullet passes that were
so delicately displayed on the
gridiron. .

Several plays later there was
an end sweep, no, a reverse, no,
it wasn’t a reverse it was a
double reverse. Later on they
were pulling double reverses
with a pass.

What about the kicking? The
official statistics showed Holland
averaging 30 yards per kick while
McCormick’s average was 33.213
per kick. The officiating‘? As usual
there were complaints from both
sides.

ed that the girl had been tapped;
below the belt. Another time one 
young lady picked up her sweat;

“Here's my belt, Ref. Why don’t§
you keep you eyes open.”
Holland scored first when a
McCormick pass from center
went‘astray in the endzone. But
McCormick went ahead in the
last period when Carla White-
head threw a 20-yard pass to
Carla Schissel, who outran the
defense for the TI). The play
covered 50 yards.

McCormick’s Coach Mike Chris-
toff was not satisﬁed with the
win. As he was being carried off
the field by the girls he mutter-
ed, “You girls didn’t score enough
points. I had 20 bucks bet on you’
but I gave. six points.” Such are
the risks of football. I ‘ I

Sharockman Scores;

Cats NOW4-2-3

By JACK SMITH

Sitting in their dressing room after the Army game Sat-
urday were a depressed group of Panthers. They had been 1»
out run, out passed and out played, yet managed to gain a
7-7 tie. The Panthers, however, needed more than a tie.

Many fans and players had visions of a bowl bid. Al-
though John Michelson claims his Panthers were taking

their games one at a time. The¢

Panthers needed wins in their re-
maining two games to obtain
post-season play. The tie all,but
erased any hopes they might have
had.

Looking at the picture painted
by the statistics, it was an even
more depressing game.

Out-Rushed-Out Passed

In first downs Army outgaincd
the Panthers 20-4. In rushing
Army picked up 99 to the Pan-
thers 53. The real story, however,
was told in the passing depart-
ment.

Army's needle threading‘ quar-
terback, Tom Blanda, broke the
Cadet passing record as he com-
pleted 24 of 35 passes for 235
yards. The Panthers gained 38
yards on one pass.

“We were protecting against
the long pass,” Coach Michclosen
said. “That is the one that scared
us. Then Blanda would hit on the
short one. He threw the ball
well."

Nothing on Ground

The Panthers’ ground attack
was rendered almost useless as
the Cadet line continually stopped
the Cats cold. Bob Clemens and
Fred Cox, two of the Panthers
top runners, ran with the ball
three times each and netted only

14-wards between them.

“I don’t know why our at-
tack wasn’t moving,” said Quar-
terback Ed Sharockman. “I z_
guess you have to credit their
line. They were ready for us
and wanted to outplay us.”

“They controlled the ball the
entire game,” halfback Clemens
said. “That is what beat us, along
with our fumbles.

Fumbles Kill Drives

Although both teams lost the
ball four times on fumbles, Pan-
thcr fumbles came during the-few
times -the Blue and Gold managed
to get a drive going.

The Panthers’ only score came ‘
late in the ﬁrst quarter when
Sharockman picked off a. Blanda
pass on the Army 39-yard line
racing the distance unmolested
for the score. Cox added the
extra point.

Army's score came in the third
quarter when, after a Panther"'
fumble, they drove 27 yards for
the TD. Fullback Al Rushatz
scored and Blanda kicked the ex-
tra point.

For the Panthers it was their
third tie of the season all by
identical scores of 7-7 and gave
the Cats a 4-2-3 ledger for the
season. A

gjpelfine -oisproves    Th .. ry;
Becomes Panther Standout

 Stokes, Clark,
 Tarkany to Run

_ By JACK SMITH

Many football players come
to Pitt with both size and abil-
ity. Some just have the ability
along with something players
refer to as guts. This is what
makes Ron Delﬁne one of the
Panthers outstanding ends.

’ When Delﬁne graduated from
Cannonsburg High School his
coaches told him he was too small
to make the Panther team. Ron,
now 190 pounds, set out to dis-
prove their theory. He made the
first team and, according to play-
ers, is “one of the best and most
consistent players on the team.”
Many players decide to come
to Pitt because of the educa-
tional opportunities. This inﬂu-
enced Ron also, but the main
factor was the trips the football
team made. .

“Before I came here,” Delfine
said with a smile, “the farthest
North I had been was Kitten-
ning. I had only been in two
States; now I’ve been coast to
coast.” Few players will admit it
but it’s a darn good reason for
attending a school where football
means travel.

As a sophomore he caught 10
passes for 142 yards. Last year
he caught seven for 67-yards and
a touchdown. Although Delfine is

Pitt News Hawks
Unveil Lineup for
Blood Bowl Game

“Victory, victory” is the
latest murmur buzzing
through the Pitt News ofﬁces
as the News Hawks prepare to
do battle with the Penn State
College’s Cowards in the

third annual Blood Bowl.

Coach “Scoop” Smith unveiled
his power—packed lineup for .the
first time today, and it appears
that he has the most impressive
array of talent since the golden
days of Jock Sutherland.

Heading the list of all-stars is
Captain Ted Colton, a senior from
McKeesport. Colton, who is Sports
Editor, is proficient in all sports,
and is frequently seen at the Field
House practicing cross—country,
wrestling, basketball, to name a
few.

“I

McKeesport Lad
He is joined by another Mc-
Keesport lad, Ron “Lefty” Maser.
Maser is a sports writer, but is
better known for his skill on -the
basketball diamond and basket-
ball court. He is also the starting
quarterback for Varsity Hall, and
..throws a pass with accuracy that
surpasses even Johnny Unitas.
Anxious for victory, Coach
Smith intends to unleash his
“animals” early in the game.
His prize “stud” is Photo Editor
Karol Lorber, the Israeli ﬂash.
Lorber is a bloodthirsty judo
expert, and the Cowards can ex-
pect some surprise punches.
Joanne “Speedy” Dolinar and
«“Tom the Bomb" Gilbertrshould
thrill the crowd with their broken
ﬁeld running. Gilbert is a hard-

Lpgnosed 135 pound halfback, who

doubles as circulation manager of
the paper. -
Defensive Experts .

Bill “Ringo” Rango, assistan
business manager, and Jim “In-
juneer” Vaughan, Executive Edi-
tor, are defensive experts who
rank with Sam Huff in ﬁerceness.
Joel “Anemia” Filner, the Cop)’
Editor, will see action if Chuck
“Hypocondriac” Dunbar, Feature
Editor, isn’t ready.

Dunbar is on loan from the
soccer squad and is slated to do
the kicking duties.

Coach Smith said, “I don’t care
if we have a small squad (average

weight is a‘ hefty 155 pounds),
 we can

beat anybody, and that it}-

rated as having a fine pair of
hands for catching passes, he has
also been a standout on defense.

“I’d much rather play de-
fense.” Delﬁne said. I like the
feeling of contact. Runners get
their glory by large gains: end
get it by catching passes. But
an end who does neither likes
contact, it makes him feel part
of the game.”

This is only one phase of the
story that makes Ron Delﬁne one
of the most underrated players in
Panther history.

(Editors Note: This is ﬁrst of
two articles on Ron Delﬁne that
will appear in the Pitt News.)

In IC4A Meet

Team chances for a titleare
sadly thrown to the winds in
the upcoming IC4A varsity
cross — country championship,
three Panther harriers will
vie for individual honors to-
day in New York. A

The three man contingent con-
sists of ace Sophomore Harry
Stokes, a threat for ﬁrst place
laurels; Co-captain Reed Clarke
and Bob Tarkany.

This trio has fared best in a
mediocre season for the bar-
riers. The team only posted a
2-6 record, and Coach Carl Rees
realized that it would be a futile
effort to take a full team to
compete on the ﬂat Van Court-
land course.

Last year Captain Ron Rush
ﬁnished ‘l9th for the highest
Panther position. The Cats placed
19th, also, out of a field of 25
teams.

In the last issue of this paper it
was erroneously reported that
Michigan State had beaten Penn
State and rated the favorite role.
However, the opposite occurred.
The Nittany Lions will -be the
leaders in this year’s competition.

Sororities Blast Dorms

For Stealing Bowl Title

NCAA May Take Action

Against Holland,

McCormick Halls for Illegal Use of ‘Powder Puﬁs’

Two University of Pittsburgh football teams may be put
on probation by the NCAA rules committee for recruiting
the name (Powder Puff Bowl) from the annual contest be-

tween the Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa Kappa Gamma.

sororities.
Last Friday Holland Hall

in what they termed the Powder’.
However, the Thetal

Puff Bowl.
and Kappa sororities have made
a formal protest to the NCAA to
have this name changed.

The Powder Puff Bowl originated
at Penn State where two chapters
of Theta and Gamma sororities
started the feminine grid game for
the purpose of raising funds for a
local charity.

Last year the game was
picked up by the Pitt sororities
and was to be an annual event.
However, this year the two
dorms jump the gun, stole the
name, and played the game a
week ahead of the sororities.

“This football game started last
year and the whole purpose of it
was to be an effort of ‘the sorority
women to help the charitable or-
ganization here on campus,” said
Sue Waite, captain of the Theta
team.

She continued, “It is not a blood
thirsty game and theree is no ani-
mosity between the two sorori-
ties.” Judy Franz, captain of the
Kappa team said, “We planned to
go on with our game which is the
Original Powder Puff Bowl.”

Rules for Signout, Dress

Women’s Housing Board has
passed three new rules dealing
with proper dress and sign-out
regulations.

Women resident students will be
required to go into the cafeteria
with their blouses tucked in and
blue jeans have been banned for
every meal. ,

In order to be permitted to
leave the dormitory overnight,
any nights other than Friday or
Saturday, a woman resident
student must do the following:

1. Fill out a special permission
form and leave it at the dorm
signout desk for the head resi-
dent.

2. Have her parents mail a writ-
ten request for this permission to
the head resident. The head resi-
dent will then make the decision
concerning the permission.

Girls wishing to move from
the dormitories into sorority
suites. sorority houses. or a
home, for the third trimester,
must submit a written request
to Miss Skewis by Dec. 1.

Jim Ludt, Pharm. sr.: “There is

student. There is no cooperation

Tony Lufrano, Arts jr.: ‘‘I am
not too familiar with the SG
operations, but with my limited
contact with it they seem to be
doing a good job.

“My contact with SG is in the
capacity of chairman of the pep
rallies which SG picked up and
tried to keep alive after the or-
ganization that handled it before
dropped it. They have even al-
located a budget for its operation
and should be commended.”

At Gen Tel, our aim is to develop the supercommunica-
tions system that will be needed to meet the demands
of tomorrow. And we're constantly shooting new ideas
at this target. S

In our 24 research laboratories, more than 3500 scien-
tists and engineers have their sights set on entirely
new concepts in order to achieve these results.

Example: a task force of General Telephone & Elec-
tronics scientists, working in the unexplored areas of
electroluminescence and photoconductivity, have
developed an operating model of a switching device
with no moving parts, that may revolutionize telephone
communications. It is a thin wafer only 3 inches square
that may someday connect and disconnect up to
10,000 telephone lines.

Meanwhile, this new discovery holds promise of having
numerous applications in other fields,inc|uding switch-
ing and read-out devices for electronic computers.
Research is but one of the many areas in which General
Telephone & Electronics is thinking and ‘working ahead
-—not only to meet today's communications needs, but

tomorrow's as well. _ r
