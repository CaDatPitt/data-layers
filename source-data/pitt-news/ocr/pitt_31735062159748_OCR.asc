Session

Men’s Council should double the
amount of work it has done this
year, if a legislative body's work

* output is proportional to the
amount of time it meets.
Next year Council will meet
from 12:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. Tues-
. day afternoons instead of from
12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. as it does
now. The meeting time was leng-
thened in the hope that projects
could be more fully discussed and
that more members could attend at
least part of the meeting.

Otherwise, the major event of
Council's last meeting of the year
was the support given to a plan to
establish an activities period dur-
ing the middle of the day on Tues-
days and Thursdays. The proposal
is at present before the University
senate. and Council’s support is
calculated by the membership to
give it a boost.

seniors will receive their diplomas.
Students in the school of medicine
will receive their degrees at the
same time as undergraduates. Dur-
ing the war and up until last year
special ceremonies were held for
med students because of staggered
semester schedules.

Former Pittsburgh Schools Head

Dr. Hill, superintendent of Pitts-
burgh schools until accepting his
present post, was born in States-
ville, North Carolina. There he
was graduated from Davidson Col-
lege and went on to do graduate
work at the University of Virginia
where he received an M.A. degree.

‘In 1930 he received a Ph.D.
degree from Columbia University
and LL.D. degrees from Pitt and
Davidson in 1943 and 1948 respec-
tively.

Shortly after the close of the
war Dr. Hill served as a member
of the United States education
commission to Germany. HE now
lives in Nashville, Tennessee.

Chancellor Presides

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
will introduce Dr. Hill and preside
over the graduation exercises.

Schools graduating students in-
clude the College, Engineering

Education, Nursing, Medicine,
Law, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Social
Work, .and the Graduate School.

The June graduating class will
exceed‘ that of last year by ap-
proximately 100. Before commence-
ment exercises last year University
officials looked apprehensively at
the job ahead, that of graduating
the then largest class in Pitt history.
and figured that they could “not

foresee another . . . equal to or.

larger than the present one.”

"Large Crowd Expected
A crowd of about 10,000 is ex-
pected to be on hand for the cere-

monies. Robert L. Arthur will direct

music for the program.

At the same time as graduation
ceremonies Colonel john 1. Hincke
will award commissions to quali-
fied ROTC cadets. Approximately
35 of the cadets will act as marsh-
alls for the program.

Congress to

Investigate

Purchase-Card System

A purchase card system whereby
students may be able to make pur-
chases locally at a discount is on
Student Congress’ investigation
list for next year. _

At Congress’ meeting Monday, a
motion was passed to further in-
vestigate the discount system,
which is in operation on several
other college campuses and has
already been looked into here.

Former Congress President Flora
Deimert, who with other ex-members
attended the meeting, informed the
legislators that the chairman of a
downtown department store associa-
tion had been contacted previously
about the purchase card system, and
had turned thumbs down,on it on
the ground that they would receive
no benefit from it.

Congress discarded the plan
after this rejection, said Miss
Deimert. However, at Monday's

meeting the members deciilﬂ to
investigate the plan in other dis-
tricts than downtown.

In addition, Congress decided to
send two observers to the national
convention of the National Student
Association at ,the end”'of August.

;ThenNS/A, it was said.,,had helped

certain universities to establish a
purchase card system and planned
many other activities to be under-
taken on a nation-wide scale.
According to Miss Deimert, an ob-
server at last year's NSA confab,
the Association’s work has gone
little beyond the planning stage,
but SC members thought it wise to
keep in touch with the work of the
organization.

As a result of the losses it has
incurred in its sponsorship of
unprofitable social functions this
year, Congress decided to sponsor
only three major dances next year,
the Grande Finale, the Military Ball,
and the Spring Festival dance.

The costs of "these events would

be paid by Congress alone. In

addition, Congress would co-spon-
so: other dances to the extent of
one-h'alf the costs, the other half
to be paid by the other sponsor or
sponsors.

The members considered the
sponsorship of a freshman dance
next year along with Men’s Council
and WSGA.

Congress decided to table for
one week the selecting of a Pitt
pChest, Fund Qommittee.

Asst. Deans
Swap Jobs

Two assistants to the dean of: C

men's staff will shift responsibil-
ities next month. A

William F. Saalbach and J. Ed-
ward Ricart will exchange posi-
tions June 1.

"This. switch will strengthen the
staff and render better service to
the University,” "Dean Biddle
stated.

Mr. Saalbach’s present position
as assistant
has him in charge of student acti-
vities as the Pitt Players and
Spring Festival plans.

Mr. Ricart serves now as assist-
ant to the Dean of Men and the
director of veteran's affairs and
housing. The University’s main
housing project, DeSoto Hall, is
included under Mr. Ricart’s supe-r-
vision.

According to Dean Biddle, the
shift in
gradual throiighout June and July.
It is arranged so that the two men
are able to assume complete re-
sponsibility of their new positions
by August 1.

The appointment of anew ad-
visor to student publications has

not yet been announced by Dean.

Biddle. This spot was vacated
when Paul Lohmeyer
recently to accept another position.
The death of William Daufen-
bach, head of the University mar-
shalls, created another vacancy
among the assistant deans.

Son, First

The 22-year-old jinx which
seems to have dominated fami-

been broken.Since 1928, eight-

Paul Miller, Civil Engineer-

I am in receipt of some insulting
letters from readers of my column

writers are undoubtedly track men.
I would like to remind these scooters
of two things; first, that everyone,

evenawriter, is entitled to his own
opinion; second, there is a law
against sending such filthy lan-
guage through the mail. If the com-
poser of one of the epistles is not
careful, he may find his running ex-
perience valuable in eluding the
postal authorities.

For a good course students might

takes field trips. The last one of
these trips was to a local brewery.
Needless to say the attendance at

Because of one of the most basic
of animal needs. We were hungry.
We wanted to have a banquet.

We reasoned thusly:

If we can set 1000 headlines at
25 cents a head, we will gross
250 bucks.

Alas, we overestimated our in-
take and underestimated our outgo.
During our best night, our record
was 84 headlines set -- 21 bucks.

Thus did News Editor Bill Scrivo describe our ill-fated ven-

In our first lucid moments since last Friday njght, we ask
ourselves again and again Why, why did we undertake so mad an

 

years by kindly grandfathers and
gentle great-aunts who had the
foresight many years ago to lay
out two bits fo a personalized
souvenir.

Dear Fellow students:

I wish to take this opportunity to
thank each and every student for
the role which he played in the
1950 Spring Festival. Regardless
of the extent, your part was needed
and appreciated. I hope you en-
joyed the Festival events as'I
certainly had a wonderful time.

I would like to extend a special
thanks to all committee members
as their tasks were well accom-
plished. Their 'responsibilities
were great but all came through
with flying colors.

From all indication, at the pre-
sent time, the "Childhood Daze”
was a financial success. As yet
complete returns are unknown.

Thanks again’ for your wonderful *

support to the greatest Festival
Pitt has ever seen. Cooperation
was top-notch.

IF Elects Jim Morton,  
Cancels School Picnic»

In what was probably the tamest
election in the history of any major
Pitt organization, Interfraternity
Council Wednesday night elected
PiKA ]im Morton as its president
for the 1950-51 year.

Running on a platform of ‘less
politics‘ -- wider representation,’
Morton was opposed only by Lambda
Chi Bob Rossell.

The other officers on IF’s five-

man Executive Board were elected
unanimously, none having any
opponent for office, Earl Jacob,
Phi Kappa, was elected vice-presi-
dent by acclamation after having
declined a nomination for president.
Theta Chi Bill Ferguson received
a unanimous vote for secretary,
and Jack Grodin, Kappa Nu, was
the only candidate for treasurer.
Reassel completed the pattern by
getting a unanimous vote as fifth
mfbmber of the Executive Board.
/‘ Before the election, IF voted to
its scheduled all-school
picnic at Kennywood, Bark. The
action was a result of the Park's
policy of refusing admission of
Negroes to the dance floor and
and swimming pool.

Since the picnic grounds will not
be limited to Pitt students, park
authorities would permit no relax-
ing of the policy.

Dick Richard’s motion to cancel
the picnic becuase acceptance of
the park’s restrictions ‘are in-
compatible with IF Council’s
tenets of equality for all; was sec-
onded by a chorus of voices and

unanimously passed." President
Ray Maher immediately directed
fraternities to recall any tickets
for the picnic that had been dis-

tributed.

Rushing rules for next year were
amended to allow rushing events
and dinner invitations at any time
during the formal rushing period,
rather than on designated dates
as was required last year.

Maher rounded out his last meet-
ing ‘as IF president by praising
Advisor Lester G. Brailey for his
contribution to the fraternities
during his first year at Pitt.

Graduating Czech Student
Cites College Freedom Here

By ARNETT ELLARD

Among the 2542 students graduating in june will be Paul
Krakes, a Czechoslovakian, who just five years ago, was working
at forced labor in a German steel factory.

Paul, a handsome boy who speaks with a charming accent,
said, "At the factory I was always afraid of being hustled off to

a concentration camp, because I
never worked in a hurry as the Ger-
mans wanted me to. My fellow work-
ers hurried though, so that they
could earn more cigarettes.

"We worked 12 hours a day andr
six days a week with German guards
standing over us all the time,” he
continued.

"For pay we received one dollar
a week, 15 bad cigarettes and a
pint of vodka.” He added, "I always
.sold my cigarettes. I received 60
cents apiece for them.”

Almost Gave Up [lope
While he was working in the fac-
tory, Paul said that he felt that his
boyhood dream of coming to a uni-

ver 'ty in the United States would
never materialize.

"I always wanted to come to an
American school,” he remarked,
"because my mother was educated
at Vassar College in New York. I
used her texéooks to teach myself
English.”

Paul looked very serious as he
said, "I like your school here much
better than I liked the University of
Prague. What I like best about your
school is that here the student can‘
openly disagree with the professor.

Ball Tickets

On Sale

*3 The‘ time is drawing near for

seniors to commence to buy their
tickets for the Commencement Ball,
April 13, at the Webster Hall Hotel.

Tickets will be on sale all this
week at the Student Desk at
$2.75 per couple. Any students
holding reservations should pick
the tickets up by Friday, May 26.
Tickets purchased at the door the
night of the dance will be $3.00.

Since there are many more se-
niors than Webster Hall will hold,
‘students are urged to purchase
their tickets this /week since sales
will be limited.

Informal dress will be in order in
an attempt to keep senior expenses
at a minimum. The dance will last
from 9 to 1 and feature the music
of Benny Benack’s orchestra.

Main feature of the evening will

be a finale waltz led by Mildred
Egge, senior queen. The couple
will lead the waltz to honor both
Miss Egge’s coronation and fellow
graduates.

Embossed souvenir diaries will
be given to each couple. They will
be bound in dark blue leather, em-
bossed in gold.

This is the first commencement
dance heldfor University students
since before thewar. Attendance is
open to any senior man or woman.
One member of the couple has to be
a . senior.‘

IN 1939 IT WAS estimated that
the average University of Wisconsin

male student spends $3.80 a week
on dates.

"At the University of Prague when
a student disagrees with the pro-
fessor, he must keep it to himself.”

Social Life Interesting
Paul pointed out that the thing

   

"I like your social life here. It is
very informal, even between the
sexes. And you have such lovely
girls.”

He did name one thing that he
doesn't like about our social life.
It is that here a boy is generally re-
stricted to date the same girl 31
the time, but in his country a boy
can date as many different girls as
he likes and won't have any ex-
plaining to do either.

Paul, a pre-law student, plans to
practice law in this country after
he finishes law school. _

He explained, "The Communists
have now taken over my country,
so I'm choosing the country which

that interests him most between
the two universities are their dif-
ferences in social life. He said,
"In Prague the school is strictly
for education. Here it is not that
way. I do not need to tell you that
I like your system better.”

He smiled broadly and stated,

At Hefty .404 Average

With only two games at West Virginia remaining to be played, the
outfielders of Pitt's baseball team continue to lead in the hitting de-

partment.

Leading batsman is Center-
fielder George Love with a .473
average. Lowe
was shifted to
the outer gardens
from first base.

Coach Ralph
Mitterling has
been using him
in the cleanup
spot.

Bobby Lewis,

playing leftfield,
is batting .377.
Another converter:

first baseman, Lowe

lefthander Pat Murphy, is hitting.

.361 while holding down the right
field post.

This trio, along with the rest of
the Panthers, has until Saturday,
June 3, to sharpen up their collec-
tive batting eyes. On this date,
Pitt goes to Morgantown for a
doubleheader to wind up the sea-

Pitt's netters were assured of a
.500 season on Wednesday when
they blanked Bethany, 9-0, on the
Arsenal courts.

The victory over the Bisons
brought the Panther record up to
(5-4). Therefore, the Pitts could
still lose their final match against
Case on June 2 at home and finish
the year with as many victories as
defeats.

The Panthers lose some men
from the lower brackets, but Johnny
Lohstoeter and Harry Campney will
be back to anchor the netters in
1951, and some good material is
coming up from the freshmen ranks.

°Long John’ Good Bet
In IC-4.»A 380-Yard Run

_ By DON MURDQCK, _ _
Johnny Wilson's chance to break into the national collegiate

track limelight will come tomorrow in New York City at the annual

IC4A track meet.

Wilson, who is undefeated in the half mile run in dual competi-
tion this year, is rated a good chance to win his favorite event.
The long striding Philadelphia ace will be running under the Pitt:

banner for the last time.
his undefeated stein appears all
the more remark-

fact that he was

not pressed in
vious meets.
he is pressed
tomorrow,’ '

It is almost
certain that the
pressure will be on tomorrow be-
cause there are four outstanding‘
entries in the quarter mile event.

Reggie Pearman, 1947 champ
from NYU and Jack Dianetti, 1948
winner from Michigan State, will of-
fer Wilson the stiffest competition.
Keen" competition will also come
from Bill Mack of Michigan State
and George Wade of Yale. Each
has done the 880 in 1:52.

Wilson left for the trip which may
‘bring him added fame early yester-
day morning. Others who left with
Wilson were John Patellos in the

 If you are in the moodifor a sermon, the theme of this one is
‘the vanity of humankind. Specifically, the inability of the species

‘"33’, man to take a ribbing.

 p , Last week News Editor
  with a few paragraphs in which he
" C‘ _‘ reflected as how track practice was
~  a, futile pastime, what with young
~ 4. men running hither and yon in their
 ‘underwear, as though being pur-
 sued by unseen spirits.
 W Well, the next morning's mail
":3 brought Scrivo, some fan mail from
_ the track team - letters which any

 "‘jEnglish, teacher would have blue-
). ‘pehciled to death for lack of varia-
‘ ‘:..,tion in word sizes. Too many four
 ytletter words.
’ if A Although Scrivo has been around
enough to understand “the language
’ fi‘ of the lavatory walls, he confesses

"__.that there were some words in his
“-mail that even he could not inter-
f: ‘preit. Nevertheless, he gathered that
> _-‘"h'e':1was not passionately endeared
A by the track team.‘-\

‘Not ‘ Futile
Now I do not for one minute agree
gwith the man that track practice is
-*':fiutile"labor. The surprisingly bright
‘record of the track team is proof of
ts merits. However, even in: dis-
agreement it is possible to delight
‘ in agood joshing - and just as pos-
.p<'.:;f¥'.‘is',ible if you are the object of that

the ludicrous.

You sit at a track meet and there
is so much going on at one time’
that you don’t know where to look.
Men are leaping, vaulting,‘throwing,
sprinting. Then all at once, every-
thing ceases. Nothing happens.

You fidget. You squirm. You
cross your legs and uncross your
legs. You take out the afternoon
paper and read the movie page,
and then CRACK! -- a gun goes off
and by the time you look up you are
told that you just missed the 100-
yard dash.

Ridiculousness

True, such goings-on as these
are not sufficient evidence to con-
demn the sport, yet it does point
up an element of ridiculousness -
an element which, by the way, is
to be found to some degree in all
sports. —

If Scrivo’s correspondents can-
not see the humor in their own
sport, then perhaps they are prac-
ticing too hard and should take
time out to learn how to laugh
again.

kiln two undefeated seasons at

Bob Prince, the radio voice, got
miffed at an item in the Pltt News’
Discards of last week.

In the item, the News stated that
“Charlie Ebert, a member of the
Dean of Men's staff, solmded like
Bob Prince on one play when he
had a Blue ball carrier tackled by
Rudy Andabaker.” It so happened
that Andabaker was also a member
of the Blue team.

Prince retaliated on his Monday
evening sports broadcast by refer-
ing to the writer of the column as a
“Granny Rice, who probably
doesn't get all A’s either.”

Well, Mr. Prince. you attended
