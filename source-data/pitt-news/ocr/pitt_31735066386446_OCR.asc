The Black Action Society has
demanded the resignation of
sophomore Lisa Campoli,
appointee to the presidential-
search committee.

See page 3

In letters to both Student
Government Board Presidentjulie
Shepard, who selected Campoli,
and Board of Trustees
Chairperson John Marous, who
gave Shepard the responsibility
of choosing someone, BAS
chairperson Douglas Ligons
criticizes the way that Campoli
was chosen and calls for her to
resign.

“We must demand that Lisa
Campoli be forced to resign her
post as the undergraduate

UNIVERSITY OF PITISBURGH

BAS demands Campoli’s resignation

representative. Also, hers and
additional positions should be
opened up so that the student
body will have representation
that reflects their importance and
vitality to the university’s
existence,” states Ligon’s letter to
Marous. '

Campoli refused to comment
on the matter and said that her
membership on the search
committee forbids her to speak
to the press.

The BAS, with over 700
registered members, is a
governance group and should
have been consulted while /
Shepard was making the decision
to appoint Campoli, Ligons said.

The letter to Shepard questions
Campoli’s qualiﬁcations, citing the
fact that she is only a sophomore
as proof that she is not familiar
enough with the workings of the
university to be able to select a
new president. Ligons said that

both Marous and Shepard made
several mistakes during the
process of picking the
undergraduate to serve on the
search committee.

“The mistake was initially made
on Marous’ part that he allowed
the search committee to be
designed such that it would only
include one undergraduate
student. Then he further
complicated the problem by only
asking Julie Shepard for a
nomination,” Ligons said.

“Julie Shepard aggravated the
process by feeling that her ofﬁce
produces {the} only qualified
candidates and that she by herself
is in a position that she can and
has the knowledge or the capacity
to select a person who could
represent the university, ” he said.

Ligons said that Shepard’s main
problem is that she believes the
false impression that Marous gave

In an Oct. 11 letter to Pitt
Students for Life, Pitt Amnesty
International business manager
John Merritt stated that he feels
the pro-life student group should
refrain from calling ‘itself a
“human-rights group." p

Article Eight of the United
Nations’ ratified Universal
Declaration of Human Rights
states, “Everyone has the right to
an effective remedy by the
competent national tribunals for
acts violating the fundamental
rights granted him by the
constitution or by law.” Merritt
said PSL’s attempt at changing
the law protecting a woman’s
right to an abortion contradicts
the Article.

Campus safety, better shuttle services and
improved housing conditions, as well as
better communication among students, the
Student Government Board and the
administration, were key issues discussed by
candidates for the 1991 SGB.

Presidential candidates Brent L. Saunders
and Michael Cohen, along with 10 board
candidates spoke to leaders of student groups

on these and other issues yesterday.

Saunders pledges to be responsible,.diverse
and energetic in all his duties as president of
the SGB. “The fundamental principles of my
campaign are representation and
accountability,” Saunders said.

Adding additional committees to better
help the SGB (including a student—affairs
committee), creating a North Oakland Shuttle,
finding a way to deal with foreign teaching
assistants, putting a crosswalk between Forbes
Quadrangle and David Lawrence Hall,

increasing financial aid, implementing public-
safety programs and establishing a block
crime-watch system are among Saunders’
goals for the year.

Saunders also addressed the need for more
on-campus housing and better living
conditions both on and off campus.

Cohen stated that his experience with the
SGB over the past two years will give him the
leadership and insight needed to be the next
SGB president “Three areas thatl would like

Coping on Campus...

More students reporting trauma from Sexual abuse

(Editor's note: Dr. Robert
Gallagher writes a biweekly
column about commonpmblems
that students eagoerience.)

One change that we have noted
at the counseling center in recent
years is the increase in the number
of students who report trauma
stemming from childhood sexual
abuse. More often than not, the
abuse has been at the hands of an
older relative or a close friend of
the family.

Most students who seek
counseling because of the effects
of sexual abuse do so with great
reluctance due to their feelings of

a shame and their belief that only

they have had this experience.
The truth is that incest alone
(apart from other sexual abuse)
is estimated to affect 12 to 30
percent of all girls and 2 to 9
percent of all boys.

The research evidence indicates
that this abuse occurs before the
victim's fifth birthday in 11 percent

of the cases and before the vic:tim’s
10th birthday in about 50 percent
of the cases. Unlike rape, 65
percent of reported sexual abuse

Dr. Robert
Gallagher

of children is non-violent. The
victims are usually coerced with
more subtle techniques, and their

 

silence is often ensured by
warnings that to talk about it will
cause great upsetin their families.
Their silence is further ensured
because the perpetrator may be
an adultwhom they trust, because
the abuse may occur over an
extended period of time and
because the victims may feel that
they were willing participants.
Studies have shown that some
survivors of childhood sexual
abuse seem to escape without
serious, long—term psychological
problems, but for many there
are damaging effects. A variety of
physical, emotional and
behavioral symptoms may
develop immediately after the
abuse or years later. Reactions
may include anxiety, fear,
depression, problems with later
sexual functioning and inability
to establish satisfying intimate
relationships. Occasionally the
aftereffects of sexual abuse can
contribute to problems such

aseating disorders and substance
abuse.

A variety of treatment
approaches have been used
successfully with adult victims of
childhood sexual abuse. In the
treatment the client and therapist
work together to address the
survivor’s feelings of anxiety,
anger, guilt, shame and sadness.
Some people choose to work
through their problems in a
support group with other people
who have also been sexually
abused.

Survivors of childhood sexual
abuse need to know that
assistance is available.

Mr. John C. Marous
Chairman

Board of Trustees

Office of the Secretary
124 Cathedral of Learning
University of Pittsburgh
Pittsburgh, PA 15260

Dear Chairman Marous:

To believe that one undergraduate student can
represent the multitudes who make up the
undergraduate college would mean to in fact be
out of touch with the student body, the people who
are to be yourfirst concern. We as students have
recognized this fact, thus the reason for forming
governance groups in addition to the Student
Government Board. We have realized that the
structure of the university is exclusive by nature
and that only placing one of our own in a position

i of influence can a group expect to be represented.

Therefore, from our point of view only whites and
possibly white women will have representation on
the presidential—search committee. This is why
we, as well as other students’ groups, have always
advocated the idea of having significantly more
student representation on the committee. This
will enable it not all the segments of the
undergraduate community to be represented, at
least a thorough cross section. ‘This is one of the
reasons why we reject Lisa Campoli as "T HE"

undergraduate appointee. We also call in to 
question her qualifications based on the limited ,

exposure she's had at the university, the limited
time she's spent working within student groups
and her basic unfamiliarity with the students that
she expects to represent.

In addition, we also feel slighted and insulted by
the fact that your office overlooked the Black
Action Society's potentially valuable input on the
President Shepard was the only
studentasked to make a nomination.) We are the
governance group for the African-American
community, and we represent the 7 to 9 percent of
the student body that the SGB unfortunately does
not. We feel strongly that amongst our ranks, and
amongst the ranks of other governance groups,
there are qualified candidates to be found, but
their valuable input and sufficient qualifications
have been.neglected because of your exclusive
practices. Thus, we also reject Ms. Campoli’s
appointmentduetothefactthatshewas appointed
by one who does not represent the majority, let
alone our community. a ,

Andfinally, we do not approve of, nor appreciate,
being left in the “dark” as to the entire process.
Julie Shepard and her office were kept informed
throughout the entire process by your office while
our governing group learned its information via
The Pitt News. The fact is that the only memo
received from your office this semester contained
the final listing of the appointees, and that was too
little, too late. ‘

Therefore, it is on these grounds that we must
demand that Lisa Campoli be forced to resign her
post as the undergraduate representative. Also,
hers and additional positions should be opened
up sothatthe student body will have representation
that reflects their importance‘ and vitality to the
university's existence. Failure to do so will indicate
to everyone interested in the university's future
the indifference that the university's administration
holds for the student body, its supposedly No. 1
concern.

“My contention is that she is not representative of the
student body, and in fact [is] only representative of the
one seventh of the undergraduate students that voted for
her. And she particularly is not representative of the
Black Action Society, who ‘didn't endorse her,".Ligons
said. .

has a knowledge of the university prior to sitting on this
committee but to also have someone that will be here
almost to, like, check up on things and to keep watching
out for things after the new president is in. I mean, I feel
like I am covering both sides of that with her being a
sophomore. And there is nothing wrong with that,"
Shepard said. ‘

Shepard said that she has no intention of asking
Campoli to resign. a

“By no means do I expect her to resign. I think she is
too far into the process now," Shepard said.

“If Lisa resigns the committee will go on. It is not going
to stop just because she has resigned. So is it better to not
be represented at all or to have at least one person on
there?” Shepard asked.

Ligons said that it is not too late for a replacement for
Campoli to be found, since the committee has not yet set
a speciﬁc time to interview presidential candidates.

Ligons stressed that not only was Campoli’s selection
incorrect, but that more undergraduates need to be on
the search comrnittee.He said that he will wait for

responses from Shepard and Marcus before taking any

further action.

Shepard said. that getting more undergraduates on the
committee has been a large concern for her. She has
spoken to the chairperson of the search committee,
trustee Farrell Rubenstein, about the matter.

Shepard was told “no one else could be added, that all
the positions were final and that there were, like, alumni
of Pitt that were already on the committee, and that they
therefore gave the committee more of a global view."

When asked to respond to the statement in Ligon’s
letter that mentions “the misguided, aloof attitude of the
Student Government Board as a whole," Shepard said,
“Let me pose this question, and I only pose it as a
question. If we can only have one student on the search
committee, would a student who is black or a white
student who is homosexual or bisexual who only
represents anywhere from 7 to 10 percent of the population
be more representative of the majority?”

She also said that she has not received any other letters
from student-group leaders criticizing her actions.

“I see no reason to keep going back over this. It is
something that is done. Now I think the major thing is to
ﬁgure out how we can provide Lisa with the most
information to get the best decision,” she said.

Ms. Julie Shepard
President

Student Government Board
639 William Pitt Union
University of Pittsburgh

Dear Ms. Shepard:

We are writing to you in order to formally voice

' our disapproval of the selection of Lisa Campoli

as the undergraduate representative on the
presidential-search committee. We in no way
feel that one student can represent the multitudes
at the University of Pittsburgh, let alone one
selected independently by you. Therefore, we
feel that along ‘with our organization, other
governance groups on campus should have been
consulted on this matter. (You have stated to our
chairman in rebuttal to criticism received about
the issue that you were forced to make the
appointment independently by the fact that there
was little time allotted to make the choice.
However, we feel that the magnitude of the
decision to be made supersedes any constraint
imposed by time and thus rejectyour excuse as
being illegitimate.)

Barring the fact that the remaining student
governance groups were. overlooked by your
office in the selection process, they still should
have been included in the list of organizations
notified of Ms. Campoli’s appointment. The fact

. that you saw fit only to notify The Pitt News is

insulting to all the governance groups on campus
who represent their constituents better than you
represent all. We feel this is indicative of the
misguided, aloof attitude of the Student
Government Board as a whole.
And finally, we challenge Ms. Campoli’s
appointment based on the fact that we feel she

may in actuality be unqualified forthe position. To ‘I

begin, she's only a sophomore, and regardless of

ar

exposure within’ the university‘°in“iofdeﬁto‘

understand its intricacies, which is essential for
being able to select a new president. Furthermore,
you claim that participants within your office are
all qualified to hold such a post, and this we also
reject. Your administration had only been in office
four of the eight main academic months, and this
is the only time when you could possibly have
been able to evaluate Ms. Campoli’s qualifications
in real-life situations. Four months, however, is
an insufficient amount of time to really get to know
any candidate for such an important post. And
lastly, overlooking Ms. Campoli’s lack of

qualifications and her appointment by one rather .

than her selection by the students, we still feel
that she is the wrong person forthe position. She
is not familiar with this governance group, its

members nor its steering committee, thus leading ‘

usto believe that she cannot adequately represent
our concerns and needs based on the fact that
she simply doesn't know them. Furthermore, in
light of all the controversy surrounding her
appointment by you, it would have been advisable
for her to make an “attempt” to represent those
you appointed her to. However, no attempt has
been made by Ms. Campoli to familiarize herself
with the concerns of the black student population,
leading us to believe that she is genuinely
unconcerned.

It is on these grounds that we fully reject Lisa

Campoli as the undergraduate representative on
the presidential-search committee. It is also
because of these concerns that we now address
ourdemandsto you, and also tothe administration,
that more undergraduate students be allowed to
participate in the search process. Thus, on your
part we shall expect immediate action in the form
of the resignation of Lisa Campoli as your
appointee and a concerted effort to be made from
your office, spearheaded by you, to force the
administration to open additional posts to
undergraduate students.

Conference to examine creative non—fiction techniques

By Jenna Ferrara
sugrwnm

Those “whatl did last summer”
themes everyone wrote in high
school could have been a lot
more interesting had the facts
been combined with fiction-
writing techniques.

Students have the opportunity
to explore the potential of non-

fiction writing at a literary-
journalism symposium tobe held
tomorrow, said Patsy Sims,
symposium coordinator.

Literary journalism is simply
factual writing in a more creative
form, according to Sims, an
assistant professor of non-fiction
writing at Pitt.

journalism can be as creative and

as imaginative as fiction or poetry.
I think that if you have something
that you really want people to
read, that if you write so that it
engages the reader, you can get
people to read a lot of things,"
she said.

Although Lee Gutkind, a
professor of non-fiction writing
at Pitt, is involved in the
symposium as a coordinator and
panel-discussion leader, he
objects to the use of the term
“literary journalism.”

He is considered by many to be
a literary journalist but “would
rather just call it good non-fidion, ”
said Gutkind, adding that all
factual writing should employ
creativity. “A lot of newspapers
use accuracy and objectivity as
an excuse for being boring,” he
said. “If you work a little harder,
you don’t have to.”

When writing, Gutkind focuses
on “total immersion” in his subject.

to spend trying to view the world

from [their] point of view. Then

According to S"-.'.s, writing in
a literary-joumalism style can
invigorate non-fiction, a genre
that is often‘ viewed as limiting.

“I hope [the symposium] will
interest students to see what
they can do with non—fiction,”
Sims said.

‘James Conaway, author of

symposium, which begins in

signing will follow at 5:30 p.m.

The reception is especially
valuable to those interested in
writing careers, according to Sims.

‘'1 think contacts are very
important in writing and in
journalism. There will be 3%
reception; there’s going to be
opportunities for students to meet
these writers and talk’ to them,"
said Sims.

Sims will introduce Conaway at
his speech, “Mixing Fact and
Fiction," at 8:15 p.m. in the Frick
Fine Arts auditorium.

Although literary journalism pro-
vides ways for writers to be creatim
with factual material, Sims stressed
that it adheres strictly to the truth.

“I encourage my students to be
inventive, and to take chances and
to experiment. The only thing that
I insist on is that [the writing] is
accurate. You don’t change your
quotes any more than you do in a
traditionally written news story.”

Attending the symposium is alsﬂi"

a way to form contacts within the
journalism world, said Sims.

“I know from my own experience
that people remember you.
Everyone thinks that these writers
are up on a pedestal, but they’re
really like you and me,” she said.
“They start out the same way. And
it’s a good entree in the future,
when you’re getting into the wtitingt,
world or the working world.

“The people that I know lin
literary journalism] are very down-
to-earth. It’s not going to be a
stuffed-shirt thing,” Sims said.

The symposium, sponsored by
the Pitt English writing department
and the College of Arts and
Sciences, is open to the «public,
and admission is free.

“The trend in the world of non-7
fiction today is away from basic
traditional journalism and toward
a more narrative journalistic style.
[Literary journalism] is essentially
what writers have been doing for
a long time,” said Gutkind.

ROTC cadets‘ outing to D.C. base proves inspirational

" Byjenna Ferrara

Staff Writer

A bus driver who thought that
his tax money was being
“destroyed, wasted and thrown
out the window, " at the Pentagon
chauffeured the Pitt Army Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps Panther
Battalion to Washington, D.C.,
last weekend, where the cadets
combined tours of national
landmarks with more
conventional fun.

First stop on Friday was Ft.
Belvoir, Va., where the 37 ROTC
cadets and six members of the
cadre unloaded their Army-issue
sleeping bags and suitcases into
the barracks.

Hours later the meticulously
groomed cadets crowded onto
the buses, anticipating a raucous

night of debauched revelry at the
FL Myer officers’ club: “where
the military goes to relax,”
according to Capt. Thomas
Donaldson.

The visit to the 0 club was
intended to “expose [the cadets]
to the things that they'll do as
second lieutenants. They'll
participate in thelsocial customs
and courtesies that we talk about
in class, ” said Maj. Beverly Ertman,
instruétor of fIrst—year cadets.

On Saturday morning unofficial
“dorm mother” Cadet Capt. Jo
Parks roused the sleepy female
cadets (the male cadets slept on
another floor of the barracks)

with her own personal reveille at
0600 hours, and the cadets headed
out to the dining hall for a genuine
Army breakfast.

Coincidentally, a medic truck
painted with red crosses drove
up outside the dining hall
alongside the bus.

“They’re not trying to tell you
anything aboutArmy chow, now,”
joked Donaldson.

After breakfast the cadets toured
the Pentagon, “the largest and
most efficiently designed office
building in the world,” according
to the tour guide. Unlike an office

officers decorated the hallways.

To some cadets, employment
in the Pentagon is the ultimate
culmination of a military career.

“When you think military, you
think of the Pentagon,” said Cadet
Staff Sgt. Kathy Williams, who
aspires to work along with its
25,000 employees, “just to say [I]
worked there."

The Military Women’s Corridor
was inspirational to many of the

, 5

female cadets. Cadet 2nd Lt. Molly

Weiler especially appreciated a '

display containing a letter from
Gen. Douglas MacArthur saying
that “the Women’s Army Corps
were dedicated and brave."

“They're going to ask me to
take off my uniform so they can
put it in there," commented
Ertman as she passed a display
case.

 ROTC

Continued from page 5

Next, the students pursuing

I health—related professions left for
j Walter ReedArmy Medical Center,
‘ and the remaining cadets went to
Arlington National Cemetery -

312 acres of gravestones.

At Arlington cadets observed
the changing of the guard at the
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
Soldiers in the prestigious Old
Guard performed the ceremony.

Cadet Staff Sgt. Mike
Mourneault is an Old Guard
veteran who stressed that his
former unit, while the epitome of
spit-and—polish drill, is also closely

, involved in tactical maneuvers.

“It's typiﬁed as a [ceremonial
unit], but everyone we’ve ever
gone out in the ﬁeld with, we’ve
beaten them," he said.

Senior cadets Quentin Battisti,
Jim 'I‘horne and Parks participated

in a wreath-laying ceremony at
the Tomb. Battisti viewed his
involvement in such a sacred
military tradition with mingled
pride and nervousness.

“I didn’t want to screw up,” he
said, “because of where I was. It's
not like it was the wreath-laying
ceremony at Pitt Stadium. It was
an honor.”

The Walter Reed tour was
disappointing to Cadet Sgt.
Jennifer Milan. “It was a general
overview that any nursing student
would know anyway.”

Regardless, the Walter Reed
hospital was impressive to some.

“It puts you in awe,” said Cadet
Platoon Sgt. Katie McShane. Cadet
Sgt Dina Brothers likened her
first visit to Walter Reed to entering
the Cathedral of Learning for the
first time.

After dinner the cadets visited

the Lincoln and Jefferson
memorials, and the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial: slabs of
somber’ black granite inscribed
with the names of the 58,132
casualties — the Wall.

Although seeing the Wall was
moving for Cadet Pvt. Sean Olson,
“I kind of felt like I didn’t really
earn the right to be there —- all
the other people were there for
their loved ones, and I just felt
like a tourist.”

By 1000 hours the next morning
the barracks was “squared away”:
sheets folded and ﬂoors mopped.

“Overall, it was a great trip,”
said Cadet Sheryl Nairne, who
was most impressed by the
changing of the guard at the
Tomb. “They're so disciplined.
You want to be like them. You
wonder if you have enough
dedication to do what they do.”

Redo the selection process...

Pitt Board of Trustees Chairperson John Marous has

. elected to have only one undergraduate student serve on

the committee to help select the new president of the
university. Because of his decision, nobody can be sure
that all student groupswill be fairly represented.

Student Goverment Board President Julie Shepard felt
that Lisa Campoli would be the best choice. Unfortunately,
Shepard did not take any other opinions into account
when she made her decision. Because of this, she cannot
be sure that she did pick the best person.

Marous gave Shepard the power to appoint a member
to the committee. Yet he has done little to help her set up
a selection process. We feel that Marous must become
more involved in this process.

Furthermore, this situation might not have arisen had
Marous decided that over 25,000 undergraduate students
could not be adequately represented by one person.
There needs to be more student input into this process so
that student concerns can be addressed before a choice
is made.

The Black Action Society sent a letter to Shepard
condemning her choice of Campoli because it does not
feel that Campoli would fairly represent its concerns to
prospective candidates. It also called for Campoli’s
resignation.

The BAS has a valid point. None of the student groups
can be sure that they will be adequately represented by
Campoli because no student group was informed of the
process Shepard used or was asked for input for
qualifications. —

Students of this university must feel safe inknowing that
the best possible candidate was selected to help choose
the next president. They will not have this knowledge,
however, until some kind of electoral process can be
established.

Campoli might actually be the best qualified person for
this job. On the other hand, she might not be the best
person capable to represent all sides of student issues.
The student organizations, because of Shepard’s severely
ﬂawed decision-rnaking process, do not know if they are
being well—represented.

Campoli should not be omitted from a list of candidates
in the reselection. Unfortunately, we won’t know without
further qualification checks.

Therefore, it is in the best interests of all students that
we concur with the BAS that Campoli step down as the
undergraduate student representative to the presidential-
search committee, so that she and any other candidate
interested in the position can be fairly scrutinized and the
best candidate chosen for this important position.

Racism more than just a practice

Here at Pitt there are
organizations which believe that
their members are being
discriminated against by the
general populace of students. Is
it possible that those who are
discriminating against others do
not truly have the right to do so?
Maybe the beliefs they hold are
instituted in them rather than
developed.

Prejudices should be thought
of as more than just violent
feelings for an individual or an
entire race. Possibly people
should begin to view racism as a
type of institution. If people would
just sit down and seriously
question their own beliefs, maybe
they would come to find that
there is no real reason for even
holding them.

‘Now I'm not speciﬁcally talking
about any one prejudice. It can
be a prejudice of anti—Sernitism,
ethnic or racial beliefs, or
homophobia; I’m talking about
the general idea of prejudice.

T oday’s racisms and prejudices
are more of programmed or
instituted beliefs rather than
developed ones. Granted, that is
an extremely generalized
statement; I do recognize that
there are people who have been

through traumatic experiences
where they would have reason
to dislike an individual or a group
which has inﬂicted some sort of
pain on them. Therefore, the
prejudice would have been
“developed.” The point I am
trying to make is that many people
(but not all) have never been

Lane
Hornfeck

through this kind of experience
and have only accepted the
beliefs which were given to them.

Virtually from childhood we
have been taught how to act,
how to speak, how to judge and
how to accept But something
even more important is that we
have been “taught” how to treat
other people on the basis of
either what they believe in or
where they are from. These
supposed guidelines are normally
how most people distinguish right
from wrong. As a small child you
never truly had the ability to
contest the issues posed by your
parents. The rules were simply
accepted.

One must act or react to a
situation by the morals or
standards he or she has been
given. The belief was installed by
a parent or guardian and..=.’;as
accepted as fact (due to the idea
that adults “know” the truth and
thus teach the truth).

So then is it possible that the
belief instituted may be wrong?

Maybe then, racism and

I prejudice should be looked at

with a view of pity. Possibly it can
be looked at not with an
equalizing hatred but rather with
an understanding. “'4

It is time for people (yes, even
Pitt students) to look within
themselves and truly question
what they believe in. It is time for
people to decide for themselves
whether or not they even have
the right to be prejudiced against
someone, let alone an entire race
of people.

As Yolanda King said when
she spoke here at Pitt on Sept‘. 712,
“There are all kinds of prejudices
we’re not even conscious of. They
have been passed on to us. When
we are willing to look, at [this]
honestly, [we can] do something
about it.”

lands new
Big East
record

By Sharon Kerestes
Staff Writer

Keith Dowling set a meet
record and led the men’s cross
country team to a third-place
finish at the Big East
Championships Saturday,
while the Lady Panther team
placed sixth overall among a
field of nationally ranked

teams, including No. 1
Villanova and No. 2
Providence.

Dowling won the the race
in 24 minutes 11 seconds,
breaking the record set last
year by Georgetown’s John
Trautmann in 24:38.
T rautrnann was the NCAA
champion last spring in the
5,0()0 meters. ,

Before the meet Coach Jim
Lear said ﬁve teams —— Pitt,
Providence, Boston College,
Georgetown and Connecticut
—— had a shot at the Big East
title.

Those teams ended up in
the top 5, with Providence
winning (55 points), followed
by Connecticut (68), Pitt (71).
Boston College (101) and
Georgetown.

Villanova (122), St. John’s
(167), Syracuse (223) and
Seton Hall (257) rounded out
the rest of the meet.

Although Pitt had set its
sights on winning the Big East
this year, the third-place finish
wasn’t disappointing, since
two of the.Panthers’ top 5
runners ran with injuries.

Jason Bodnar, normally Pitt’s
No. 2 man, had been suffering
from a knee injury the past
three weeks and has only
trained three or four days
during that time. It was
questionable whether he
would even run at the Big East
Tournament.

Jim Hamilton, another
consistent top 5 man, also ran
despite an injured quadricep
muscle. Pitt overcame the
setback, however, with the
key performances of Mike
Formica and Tom Swartout.
Formica had an exceptional
race and finished second for
Pitt, 10th overall.

“It was the best race of his
life,” Lear said. “He’s had a
great attitude throughout the
season.”

Formica competed through
a severe case of the ﬂu earlier
in the season and still managed
to score for Pitt in the critical
meets at Penn State and West
Virginia.

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

Prior to the start of the season, the Pitt
Panthers were expecting big things in 1990. And _
why not? The team was coming off an emotional
31-28 victory over Texas A&M in the John
Hancock Bowl, and a rigorous training camp in
Johnstown had the team firing on all cylinders.

It was supposed to be a new beginning for the
team. A new coach, a new defense, a new
attitude. “Raise the Level” was the cry as the team
looked to bury the turmoil of the Mike Gottfried
era.

For two games all was running smoothly. The
team was 2-0; both victories were lopsided
contests, and the future looked bright.

But then the engine died. A 52-10 blasting by
the Oklahoma Sooners left the Panthers in a
shambles, a condition they have yet to emerge
from. ’

After last Saturday’s 27-20 loss to Louisville,
the Panthers are 3-3-1, and with Notre Dame,
Miami and Penn State still on the schedule, the
team is looking at a possible losing season, its
first since 1984 and only its second since 1972.
Even Temple, at 3-3, is not the cream puff it was

expected to be in August. - V

“It’s time for a pride—check now to salvage the
rest of the season. Our goal was to go to a major
bowl this season; obviously that doesn’t look
good now. Notre Dame is our bowl game,” said

You win some, and you lose
some. This may very well be the
theme for the 1990 Pitt soccer
team, as they split a pair of road
games last weekend at Providence
and Boston College.

_ The road trip began on a down
note, as the Panthers dropped a
close 3-2 decision to Providence
on Friday, eliminating the
Panthers from making the Big
East playoffs. But the team
regrouped to pull out a 1-0 victory
over the Boston College Eagles
on Sunday.

Senior Bryan Hammond led
the Pitt attack with two goals in
the first half on Friday. His first
score came at 8 minutes and 56
seconds and was assisted by
forward Don Overmier.
Hammond blasted a shot from 18
yards out that beat the Friar
goalkeeper, giving the Panthers a
1-0 lead.

His second shot came at 30:30
of the first half on a 25- yard bolt
that Hammond booted into the
lower left corner of the goal. This
gave Pitt a 2-1 lead, which it
preserved until halftime.

Following the halftime break
Pitt’s game began to unravel.
Providence scored twice within a
10-minute span, both goals
comi ng on defensive breakdowns
in Pitt’s own zone.

Pitt’s goaltender Jay Kapusta
played well in the defeat, despite
giving up three goals.

Junior Bill Trappen felt that
“Providence was a good team but
definitely not the best team we’ve
played this year. We were clearly

the better team on Friday.”

The defeat was not only a
disappointment as far as losing,
but it was also crippling to the
Panthers’ playoff hopes. This loss
at Providence eliminated the
Panthers from playoff contention
and left their conference record
at 1-3-2.

Sunday brought a chance for
redemption, and the team seemed
ready to capitalize on this
opportunity. Pitt’s defense was
the key here, as it completely
shut down the Boston College
attack. The only score of the
game came at 33:30 of the first
half on a shot by senior_captain
Nick Liberati, assisted by
midfielder J.R. Perdue.

The defensive combination of
Liberati, Scott McCurry, Mike
Watson and Roberto Croce
provided excellent marking on
Boston College’s top players and
completely shut them down.

The foursome’s play “really
became important in the second
half when the Eagles began to
apply serious pressure. Time and
time again the defense and

goalkeeper Sobelman turned
away the BC attack as it pressed
for the tying goal that would
never come.

Pitt completed the 1-0 shutout
of Providence and raised its Big
East season record to 2-3-2.

After the game Sobelman was
quick to recognize the players
who had helped achieve his

shutout, the third of the season ,

for him. “The defense came
through when we needed it. In
the second half they played really
well, especially when [BC] put
the pressure on,” said Sobelman.

Notre Dame will be Pitt's 1990 bowl gam

“It’s all there. It’s at night. It's
on national television. Sell-out
crowd. You have all the earmarks
of a bowl game," said Hackett.

Although that is about two

months earlier than t.he Panthers
would have liked, that’s the reality
that they have to face.

“You never think of a [possible]
losing season,” said quarterback
Alex Van Pelt. “But in the worst-
case [scenario], we could be

looking at that.”

“We’ve played good quarters
here and there. Sometimes we’ve
stoned [the other team], but then
we give up the ball after three
plays. Until we all come together,
it’s going to be tough,” said Van

Pelt.

“We knew our backs were to
the wall going in. We knew we
had to win the rest of our games.
I don’t know why we need any
more inspiration than that. I don’t
know why we have to be down

by 21 points before we come on,”
said Hackett. “After Syracuse, I
hoped that would be a spark to
canyusthrough theWestVirginia
game. It did not. I hoped Ia 45-21
win over] Rutgers would create a
spark for the Louisville game, but
that didn’t either. Hopefully, we
can use this fourth quarter to
sneak up on Notre Dame, like
Stanford did.” The 2-4 Stanford
Cardinals upset Notre Dame, 36-
31, at Notre Dame Stadium on
Oct. 6.

Last year the Panthers struck
first against the Irish in their
meeting but ended up on the
short end of a 45-7 blowout

The Irish enter Saturday’s game
at 5-1, ranked No. 3 in the country
and looking for their second
national championship in three
years.

“I would say this game coming
up Saturday night will be the
highlight of our season, because
that’s what’s left,” said Hackett.
“We'll find out where we are.”

meet and doing all the little things

i right,” Formica said.

“Jason [Bodnarl and Jim
[Hamilton] showed a lot of guts
justbyshowing up.and running,”
he said. “It helped everyone else
just to know they were there.”

Pitt’s Scott Humphrey placed
14th-, Swartout, 21st; and Bodnar,

, zsm.

Swartout also ran the best race
of his life, said Lear.
“They wanted to». win, but I

think they know in their hearts *

that we did a good job," Lear said.
"Just as easily, we could’ve fallen
apart and taken sixth. In past
years maybe we would’ve done

. that. But that's what makes this

year’s team different.”

The No. 1-ranked Villanova
women’s team defended its Big
East title by sweeping the race. Its
runners captured the first five
places, beating even No. 2
Providence’s first runner. .

Behind Villanova’s 15 points in
second place was Providence
(53), and No. 5 Georgetown (77)

was in third place. The rest of the '_

team standings are: Boston
College (123), Connecticut (155),
Pitt (186), St. John’s (202),
Syracuse (209) and Seton Hall
(238).

The other six teams had trouble
dealing with the fast pace set by
Villanova, Providence and
Georgetown.

“Because they go out so fast,
everyone else gets sucked out
fast,” Lear said.

Stacey Wyzykowski led Pitt’s
runners and finished 28th,
followed by Laura O'Donnell,
33rd; and Carmella Marianni, 39th.
