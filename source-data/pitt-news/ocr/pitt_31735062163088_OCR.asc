 Aship indicated the new Wild-
_7"w_ood Golf Club. would accept
' Wmembership applications from
the general public.
_In an earlier letter to ,Club
members, Dr. Litchﬁeld had cited
the following reasons for the Uni-
yersity’s willingness to sell Pitt
lWildwood:l . ’
A Reasons Presented
-1. Its limited ‘use by both fac-
ulty and students, stemming pri-
 ‘nxiarily from its inaccessibility.
ll‘ 2. The substantial amount per
faculty members of the Club re-
presented by the capital invest-
” ment in the facility. '
*3. The continued and increasing
operating deficit of the Club, in-
creased by the recent addition of
the property to the" tax rolls.
‘* 4. The_ need for further substan-
tial capital improvements in and
renovations to the property.

In -his earlier letter, Dr. Litch-
ﬁeld had said. that the property
would be sold only on condition
that faculty members continue
to receive “special considera-
tion” and “preferential retreat-
ment.” ‘

The 173—acre tract was purchas-
ed by the University in November
of 1955. For ten prior years it had
‘served as Camp Hubbard for the
.Allegheny Council of the Boy

Scouts of America and before that
had been a golf club.

McDaniel Plans
To Leave Chem
Department in Fall

Dr. Darl H. McDaniel, assistant
professor of chemistry, will be
leaving the University in Septem-
ber. .

Dr. McDaniel, who had been at
Pitt‘ since, 1954,‘ has accepted an
offer at the University of Cincin-
nati which he feels is an advance-
ment in rank for him.

’ He says that since the chemistry
department is_ smaller than that

here there will be a better oppor-
,tunity for him to do research.’
While at the University, Dr.
McDaniel taught both graduate
and. undergraduate courses in
inorganic chemistry, and direct-
ed some graduate research work.
He received his B.A. at Antioch
College in 1950 and was awarded
a Ph.D. in 1954 from Purdue Uni-
versity. ‘
v Commenting on his work at the
University, Dr. McDaniel said,-"‘I
enjoyed my work and feel that it
has provided me with a fine
chance to develop in my ﬁeld.",

%-Unwise Overcall Loses

800 Points  

for Bidder

By JOHN LOWENTHAL
Almost any thirteen point ‘hand is good enough to open
thebidding; it is not necessary to have a strong suit. The op-

ponents can rarely double an

opening bid for penalties and

know what theyare doing because neither opponent knows

the other’s strength and distribution. Once somebody has__

opened the bidding, though, his partner, knows that he has

afisome strength; moveover he has
a rough idea where the strength
"lilies. An ‘intervening bid by the
opponent may therefore be doub-
led with conﬁdence.
Since this is the case, the per-

‘son‘,c‘ontemplating the overcall,

(intervening bid) should have
"some assurance of the safety of
*‘-;.;-his bid, and this assurance comes
1'--in thegform of a long-solid trump
{_’suit. S-Ax, I-I—xxx, D.-X, C-KQJ
 ' _10xxx must take seven tricks with
‘coiild, be set only one ‘trick. It
would therefore be asound over-
callof an opening one-spadebid,
, for instance. I - _
.In the following hand‘ West had
_13;1points and two doubletons, but
. h"is_ scattered strength and shaky
. ' suit made his“ overcall very poor
"and he got badly punished:

. Note the" following features of
the hand; West, did not have to

a little strength, and most im-

portant of all, North-South could»

not make game if allowed to play
the hand. '

:-

Was North clairvoyant in doub-“-

ling? No, his double was fairly

normal. In’ the next column I shall

discuss what would induce" North

to double an overcall at such a V

low level (and rake in all the
chips!) I  Q

But the real.p‘oint is that thir-
teen points, or. fifteen points, or
even eighteen points’ do not give
West license to overcall without‘

‘a long, powerful trump suit.

1960,‘ Olympics
Calls Panfher's

 
     

By TED COLTON-
Spdrts Editor

Larry Lauchle, Pitt’s 130 pound wrestling captain, has just‘com-
Wpleted a successful attempt to qualify for the United States Olympic
team. The young junior from Muncy, Pa., came in second in the
5' .Olympic’tryouts and first in the Greco-Roman tournament.
There are two different styles of wrestling in the Olympics. One
’ 0 0' " is the regular Olympic style and the
other the Greco-Roman style. The
United States will take two teams of
wrestlers: one wrestling one style and the
second team wrestling the other. In
order forra wrestler to make -the trip he
must qualify for one or the other, or
both.‘ Lauchle is one of the few athletes
who qualified for both styles. Incident-
ally both styles are quite different from
our own collegiate style of wrestling,
which Lauchle has mastered to per-
fection. -

__ Lauchle But the road to the Olympics is not
yet paved for Larry. He still must. defeat the two other wrestlers who

qualiﬁed_with him in the recent tourney. On July 22, these three

, wrestlers who qualiﬁed for the Olympic style wrestling; will be sent

to a camp at the University of Oklahoma.
A ‘ Here they will train and eliminate each other until there is
just one athlete remaining in each weight class. The winner
will represent his country in Rome at the Olympics. Since
Lauchle finished second to Dave Auble of Cornell in the Olympic

. style wrestling he will have his work cut out for _him if he goes
to Rome with this team.

Lauchle’s only decisive collegiate defeat came at the hands of
Auble in last year’s National finals. But he has beaten Auble a
couple of times during the past summer.

However he does stand a better chance in the Greco-Roman

_' style since he has already‘d,efcated everyone in his class. Although

it may sound strange the year 1960 has been a disappointing one

for Lauchle. He had high hopes of capturing the Eastern and Na-
tional 130 pound championships, but had to settle for second in
both cases. Being second best in the country may be enough for most
athletes, but not for Lauchle.

 Lauchle’s college wrestling career record”is an outstanding

one. He has never lost a dual meet match and the only losses

'; T that blot his record are the ones he suffered in .the finals of the.
1 Eastern and National tournies. Even his two tourney losses" this
 year were heartbreakers.
 ‘ In the 1960 Easterns he ran up against an opponent who was

especially good on takedowns. In the ﬁrst two periods Lauchle found
 } himself trailing by seven points. At this stage he attempted one of
 .the greatest comebacks ever seen in the Eastern tourney. But he
_' vfell one point shy of a tie.

Army Wins EIGA Tournament .

As Cat Glfers Finish   Ninth A’

C o a c h‘ George Underwood's
Panther golf team ﬁnished ninth
in the Eastern Golf Tournament
this weekend on their own course.
The best a Cat individual could
do was a tie for eighth.

Otis Oliver shot a 77-75 for a
total of 152 to lead the Panthers.
Ten other golfers had identical
totals. Yale, defending champs for
the past ten years, could finish no
better than sixth, as the Cadets
from Army won the team title.

Following Army’s team total of
754 were Penn (757), Penn State
(761), Princeton (767), Navy
(768) Yale (774), Syracuse (775),,
Boston College (780), Pitt (789)
and Cornell (795). These‘ were the
top ten teams. '

Don Norbury 0 Penn was the
leading individual as he shot‘ a
71-69 for a total of (140. The total
was very good forthe wet course.
Following Norbury were L. Yan-
cey of Army (144), D. Burgoon of
Penn State (144), Dick Moynahan
of Navy (145) and Ron Edlestein
also of Army (147)..

Army became the favorite to

weather turned bad. The Cadets,
conditioning and clothing were a
big factor in the tournament.

Other Panther scorers were Ron
Dermitt (155), Tom Treese (156),
Dale Long, (162), Bob Mckenzie
(164), Gary Stuart (168) and R.
W. Long (169). ,

Mittersi Snap Losing Streak

 2-.Panthe

rs Down Buck

By JACK Sl\II'l‘H

Other baseball teams are notorious for winning only at
home, but the Panthers have reversed this and proven them-
selves a road team as they won three of their four victories
in 14 starts away from their green pastures.

Twice last week the Panthers played at Forbes, Field and
lost both games. Today they come up for the third time at

Forbes Field, this time againstO
‘California

State College. They

‘must win this one or sink beneath

a dismal season.
The Panthers fell 6-0 to Clarion

 and 5-4 to Duquesne, but Satur-

day the Panthers exploded,

Dagainst Bucknell with a 15 hit

' as though Bucknell had the game’

  i Lauchle

barage to win 12-10.
/ Ditka Hammers Homer
Throughout the game it looked

in their back pocket, but Mike

(The Hammer) Ditka hammered .

a shot over the left ﬁeld fence
with one -on to put the Panthers
within ‘striking ' distance.

And when Third-baseman

" zaerry Matulevic singled in the

, eighth withthe bases loaded, the
Panthers pushed across the ‘two
that gave them their winning
margin. _

Pete Suder, still playing short-
stop with a sore leg, went 4 for

6 including a home run that was
better for directionithan distance.
With one on Suder. sent a shot
down the right ﬁeld line, ‘a place
where Bucknell had no fence.
Bats Come Alive

Ditka wentV2-5, Lefty Maser 2-5
including a triple, and Nick Kart-
sonas went 3-5- hitting a double

‘and a triple —— driving in two
rbi’s.
The Panther pitching still

leaves.‘much to be desired as
they gave up their share of
hits. Lauren Guthrie \started-
after several weeks of arm trou-
ble put tired quickly.

He was relieved by the First
Baseman Maser who, after sev-
eral innings, turned the problem
over to‘ Ken Ketterer. No one
seemed to be able to solve the
Bucknell puzzle until Ralph Shut-
terly came along and cooled off

Seeks Olympic Berth,

(Continued from Page 6)

Again in the nationals, Lauchle received another bad break.

He lost by one point,although_ many observers felt that Larry deﬁ-

nitely had 'a takedownl ‘in the closing minutes. The referee saw’

' otherwise. And so Lauchle had to settle for second ‘once more.

He has one chance to redeem himself. That is I to make the
_ Olympic team. This is not am easy taskeven though-Larry is one
of the best collegiate wrestlers in the country. For Olympic style
wrestling is an entirely different sport. V _
Lauch1e’s success so far in the Olympic tryout is typical of
the athlete that he is. For Lauchle is not just an ordinary wrestler
. who was satisﬁedto win an‘Eastern championship and be runner
.up in a few more coveted positions, but Larry is a great wrestler
who puts eveigything he has into his sport: The fact that he lost _
several matches must be attributed to the bad breaks that are
always prevalent in competitive sports and can not be taken away
' from Larry’s greatnesslas an ‘athlete. . ‘
Today Pitt can be proud of Larry Lauchle. But surely Larry’s_real
reward will come if and when he makes the trip to Rome. To be able
to represent his country in the Olympics isvthe ultimate goal of every
amateur athlete in the country and Larry is no different. ‘Maybe-it is
looking a little too far into the /future’, but we certainly hope that if
' Larry does make the team he will make Pitt even prouder of him by
capturing a gold medal for his country. Good luck, Larry Lauchle;

West Virginia
For 2nd Win

‘.‘We went to West Virginia
Friday expecting to get ‘a
workout,” P a n t h e r track
Coach Carl Rees said, “but we
could have had a better prac-
tice among ourselves.” The
thinclads edged the Mountaineers
87-44. ‘

Rees did his best to hold down
the score, but to no avai1..Most of
the Pan,thers.only ran  one race.
“Some of our better runners let
their teammates win in order to
help them win their letters,” Rees
said. Another gift to the Moun-
taineers.. V’

West Virginia did capture a first
‘in the high and low hurdles and

javelin. The Panther waltzed

ning the race_ by.85 yards in
1:57.4. Jim Donahue won. the
well surprised everyone by
placing second in that event.
Donahue decided to let Dave
Kelly win the 220, but with 50
yards to go, Donahue saw that
Kelly wasynot going to make it.
Donahue then stepped on the ac-
celerator and breezed past a West
Virginia flash to easily win the
race in 22.5. . -
All was not lost for Kelly,
however, for he won the 440 in

52.1. Reed Clarke won the mile
' in 4:34, quite a feat for Clarke

since West Virginia’s Henry

Rogers‘ beat him during the in-

door season. _ Lee Pfrogner won
the pole vault in 12' 6". Ed
‘ Sherlock leaped 5’. 6" to win the
high jump, a height that the

Mounties found physically ‘ in-

surinountable.

Larry Och won the, shot put,
Dan Kanell, the discus and Ed
Vamos the broad jump. Each
event was not as interesting as
West Virginia beating Washington

and Jefferson on Saturday, 90-39.

I EUROPE MADE SIMPLE: No.1

Summer vacation is just around the corner, and naturally all of ‘ '

you are going to Europe. Perhaps I can offer a handy tip or
two. (I must confess I have never been to Europe myself, but

I eat :1. lot of Scotch broth and l"rcnch dressing, so I am not

entirely without qualification.)

First letme say that no trip to Europe is complete without
a visit to England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, Germany,
Spain, Portugal, Italy, Lichtenstein, Holland, Belgium, Switzer-
land, Luxembourg, Denu1a.rk, Sweden, Norway, Finland, P0-

land, Czcchosiovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Russia,-

lrcccc, Yugoslo.via., Albania, Crete, Sardinia, Sicily, Hungary,
liomania, Bulgaria, Lapland, and Andorra.
Let us take up these co’untrics in order. First, England.
The capital of England is I.ondon—or Liverpool, as it is
sometimes called. T here are many interesting things to see in

I.ondon——’chieﬁy, the changing of the guards. The guards are ,

ch:mgod daily. The old ones are thrown away.-

Another “must” while in London is a visit to Buckingham .

Palace. ‘Frequently in the afternoons Her Majesty the Queen
comesout on_ the balcony of the palace and waves to her loyal
subjects. below. The loyal subjects wave back at the Queen.

. However, they only continue to wave as long as Her-Majesty

is waving. This of course is the\origin of wave lengths from which

we have derived numerous beneﬁts including radio, television 

and the A&P Gypsies.
Be sure also when you are in London to visit the palaceof

" the Duke of Marlborough. Marlborough is spelled Marlborough,

but pronounced M arlboro. English spelling -is very quaint but

 terribly disorganized. The late George Bernard Show, author of

Jo's Boys,-. fought all his life to simplify English spelling. He
once‘ asked a friend, “What does g-h-o-t-i spell?” The friend
pondered a bit and replied, “Goatee.” Show sniggcred. “Pshawf!
said Shaw. “G-h-o-t-i does not spell goatee. It spells fish. 6'}:
as in enough, 0 as in women, ti as in motion.”

It must be remembered, however, that Shaw was a vegetarian
-which, all in all, was probably a good thing. As Disraeli once
remarked to Guy Fawkes, “If Shaw were not a. vegetarian, "no
lamb chop in London would be safe.” A

But I digress. We were speaking of the palace of the Duke of
Marlborough—or Marlboro, as it is called in the United States.
It-is called— Marlboro by every smoker who knows ﬂavor did
not go out when ﬁlters came in. Be sure you are well supplied
with _Marlboros when you make your trip abroad. After a long,
tiring day of sightseeing, there is nothing so welcome as a fine,
ﬂavorful Marlbéro and a foot bath with hot Epsom salts.

' Epsom salts can be obtained in England at Epsom Downs.

Kcnsington salts can be obtained at Kensington Gardens, Al-
bert salts can be obtained at Albert Hall, Hyde salts can be

~ obtained at Hyde‘Park, and the crown jewels can be obtained

at the Tower of London. .

1 Well sir, now you know all you need to know about England.

r011 Scientist’s
Responsibility

 ‘By Lois DIAMOND /
 The fact that the social re-
}sponsibility A of the scientist
changes naturally with the
cfonsta15t- evolution of society,
»was the basis of British.phys-
_'iciSt Dr. Norman Feather’s

ﬂlecture before the» Midday audi-
ence" last Wednesday. .
 “No one can appreciate men of
' science in society, without seeing
how they have” fit into society

‘*s"c,ien'tists,”—said Feather. Practic-

‘to the intellectual contributions "of

“It was not until the founding

, in 1660,” said Feather with
it ’ pride,” that there was a true up-
surge of science and scientists.”
,Six years later Louis .XIV
-founded the Academic Des Sci-
ences in France. ‘
. ' In this period criticism was di-
rccted against physicists, accused
of fostering atheism and concern-
ing themselves with trivialities.
Society ﬁnally began to pay tri-
bute to the achievements of,phys-

explained the physicist, only to
' turn around and attack the bio-
logists. -

Feather concentrated on the role:
