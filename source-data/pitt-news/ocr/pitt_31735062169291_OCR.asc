“I didn't know that Langstaif
had a private business on the
side until the article appeared
in The Pitt News,” stated Chan-
cellor David H. Kurtzman in a
Pitt News interview. “This is my
only exception to the Universi-
ty’s statment,” he continued.

Kurtzman referred to the offi-

.cial University statement which

appeared in last Wednesday’s
Pitt News. It said, “Mr. Lang-
st_aﬁ’s investment in the Oak-
land business was long standing
at the time of his appointment
as director of Auxiliary Enter-
prises, and it was well known to
the University Administration.
-Further, he has been scrupulous’
about calling this matter to the
attention of successive adminis-
trations . . .” ‘
Joseph Colangelo; director of

University News and Publica-
tions, replied,‘“I suppose the oc-
casion for Langstaff to discuss
his ownership with Kurtzman
never came up. I gbt the infor-
mation for the statement from_
Langstaff and others in the Ad-
ministration. Mr, Monnett (for-
mer Vice-Chancellor of Finance),

David Smith (assistant to the" ‘

V ice-Chancellor of Finance), and
Paul Solyan (Comptroller) all
knew that he owned Your Cam-
pus Store.”

“Langstaif made no. attempt
to make his ownership secret,”
Colangelo stressed. “We don’t
feel there was any wrong do-
ing, even though it seems an
opportunity may exist for him
to proﬁt. To the‘ best of our
knowledge, he has not exploit-

ed the conﬂict of interest, if in-

DR. DAVID KURTZMAN
Discusses Statement

Langstaif checked with Monnett

I don't know too much about the

deed one exists. Whether‘  op-
portunity of a conﬂict‘ of inter-
est exists, I feel you can argue
this point from both sides.”

Commenting on a possible con-
ﬂict of interest, Dr. Kurtzman
state, “A conﬂict of interest ex- -
ists if they (both Langstaff and.‘
the University) are in the same
business. It may well be that

“The Book Center is one of '

It serves the community, stu-
dents, and faculty. The Univer-

Book Center, of which the com-

liancellor 

munity and the University can

(be proud. It was decided that
the Book Center would handle’
items which relate only to books. ,

Optimistic Belief in Religion

by ROBERT ZAVOS

Professor Langdon Gilkey
ended the Pitcairn— Crabbe
series in radical theology on
Thursday With an optimistic
belief in God that none of his
predecessors seemed to hold.

Prof. Gilkey believes the radi-
cal theologies are too secularly
orientated and hopeless for us
to consider. They leave out “un-
deniable and signiﬁcant aspects '
of life . . . which are so clearly
true that they hardly need to be I
be refuted.”

For Prof, Gilkey, “lVlan is a
religious being and must be un-
derstood in this light.” Life may
at times seem baﬂling and hope» :-
less, but our problems give us
hope, renewal, and love.

In this sense, the _ word God
has a meaningful usage. God is
not to be looked at, not to be
considered as a ﬁnite object
which can be examined in a lab-
oratory experiment. .

“We only see the problem of
God when we can‘ not ﬁnd him,”
suggested Prof. Gilkey. _“When
weiask what is life all about, We
must answer: “to be and love
our fellow human beings.”

“We need what we call mean-
ing to live actively and creative-
ly,” explained Prof. Gilkey-
“Meaning is the fuel that stokes
the human machine.‘ Love of
what we_do as worthwhile gives
direction to human existence.”

CAMPUS MORALITY

A special supplement con-
cerning campus morality will
appear in Wednesday’s issue
of‘ The Pitt News.

The supplement, the ﬁrst of I
its kind published at the Uni-
versitywill include articles on
drugs, cheating, birth control, ‘

L  .‘ _ and religion at the University. '

 

“But like life, purposes are vul-
nerable and v we often question
them.” Things become meaning-
less and this leads to dispair.
Meaning is the most precious
thing destiny can bestow upon
us. A

“With meaning things become
significant in _ spite of insigniﬁ-
cance. It is this that leads to the
providence of God. In the midst
-of all meaningless, We ﬁnd
meaning in our lives. The secu-
lar life must move into the
realm of religion it it is to re-
main life.”

PROF. LANGDON GILKEY
Pitcairn-Crabbe lecturer.

“We are temporal-we are in
time but time is also in us. It
pushes us across the narrow
stage and eventually off it. It
threatens the ‘strength of our
own ,reality' and significance.”
Prof. Gilkey cited the words of
his teacher‘ Paul Tillich: “There
is a deadline on life like there
is adeadline on your papers.”

The American culture spends
a great deal of time trying to
hide this coming of death with
cosmetics, and the like. Accord-
ing to Prof. Gilkey, the only
thing we can do is ﬁnd mean-
ing in our lives by ﬁnding God.

‘by members of his committee.
“We have. restricted our re-
search primarily to the Oakland . .

cause we feel that Oakland is
the area of prime interest to _
University students.” LaPietra
also reaffirmed that discrimina-
tion of any kind would not ‘be
tolerated.

Senator George Doperak made
a. report concerning SG’s prog-..
ress with the Scaife Hall cash-
ier situation. Senator Doperak
stated that Scaife Hall cashier
window was open only on Tues-‘
-days and Thursdays. “This, ac-
cording to Senator Doperak, “in-
terfered with the schedules of
students who had labs on those -
days.” However, after three"
weeks of meeting with Paul
Solyan, the comptroller of the
University, it was agreed that
the’ cashiers window would be
open ‘Monday through Friday .
from 10 a.m. to 1:30 pm. ~

Two bills were proposed. How-_
ever, the bills never reached the

. p , Few students hurrying late to
 class in Langley Hall realize

that the building, housing lab-
,oratories, lecture halls, and

= classrooms, was named for one
of Americas foremost scientists,

Samuel Pierpont Langley, for

"20 years a professor at the Uni-

‘ versity.

I Born in 1834 in the small town
of Roxbury, Mass., Langley came
to Pittsburgh in 1867 as a pro-

-fessor of astronomy and physics

at“ the Western University of

Pennsylvania, now the Universi-

- ‘ty of Pittsburgh. On the school's

a North Side site he constructed

 an observatory Where he made

_ -drawings of sunspot activity

 that remained as standard text-

book illustrations for over 50

‘ -years. c" ’

While Langley felt that the

i most important work an astron-

. omer could perform was the

-study of the sun, the basis of

. wordly, if not earthly, pursuits,
"* the development of the airplane.
At the age of 51, Langley be-
gan to design heavier-than-air
< crafts that were capable of car-
rying a man into the sky. In
— 1887, he was called to Washing-
ton to head the Smithsonian In-
1 stitution, and in the same year
~-published _I_1is treatise Experi-
'*-xments in Dynamics, the first
. work by a. recognized scientist
-Ito deal with aerodynamics.
I In 1896, L/angley, with the ﬁ-
nancial backing of Pittsburgh
-. industrialist William Thaw, con-
_structed a onequarter size mod-
cel aircraft which ﬂew at a rate
' of 25 miles per hour for almost
\a mile. Congress, in the mean-
 time, excited -by the war with
‘;Spain, appropriated to Langley
_ funds for further research.
] . Langley’s full-size aircraft of
I 1903, which preceded the Wright
;Brother’s machine’ by a few
--months, was plagued by a series
of accidents which caused it to
V crash, without scuccessfully ﬂy-
ing, into the Potomac River on
I two occasions.

-S-Langley Hall Honors S
 University Air Pioneer

Langley became a recluse, and,
in 1906, died of what was “popu-
larly termed a “broken heart.”

However, in 1914, inventor
and air pioneer Glenn Curtiss,

blocked by Wright patents from -

-building a plane of his‘ own, re-
moved ‘the Langley craft from
the Smithsonian loft where it
had been stored, installed a more
powerful motor, and flew the
plane across New York State’s
Lake Cayuga. ,

To honor the martyred Lang-
ley, the Smithsonian placed his
restored craft on prominent dis-
play with a plaque proclaiming
it as the ﬁrst heavier-than-air
craft to lift a man. And, in 1961,
when the University of Pitts-
burgh built a new science build-
ing, it was natural that the
structure should be named Lang-
ley Hall, after the University’s
own air pioneer.

Chancellor’ David H. Kurtzman’s candor in acknowledging his un--
awareness that “Langstaff had a private business on the side” reveals a
glaring fallacy in the University statement issued in Langstaff’s defense.
The University stand claimed that Langstaf’f’s “investment in the
was well-known to the University administration.”
Regardless of how many administrators knew, this is no justiﬁcation that
the highest official of our University, a man under whom Langstaff work-
ed directly for three months (when Dr. Kurtzman was Vice-Chancellor of
Finance), had to be notiﬁed of Langstaff’s ownership of Your Campus

If Langstaff had been “scrupulous about calling this matter to the
attention of successive administrations,” as the official statement declares,
Why was Chancellor Kurtzman placed in theawkward position of not know-
ing that his director of Auxiliary Enterprises was also in private business

dealing with a possible competing line of merchandise? _
Far from clearing up the issue of a conflict of interest, this new
revelation serves to re—emphasize the need for an investigation of Lang-

or the ‘ ‘Commuter Associa-

The president of MC has
sought to deﬁne the role of
his group in a “two level”
scheme. ..The ﬁrst level is one
of programming special
events. Included in this are
programs with considerable
value — Freshman Camp,
Freshman Orientation,
Transfer Day, and -the Activ-

as careers “programs, draft
seminars and leadership con-
ferences can also be valuable

But University-wide elec-

fulﬁll this role. A student
committee under the Dean
of Men’s office, structured
and staged like the Student
-Union Board, could fulﬁll
these functions.

THE SECOND level sug-
gested by the MC president
is a justiﬁcation of Univer-

tends that MC can take

ns-Problems and Progress
again that he will not shy away from the truth, even at the expense of
placing himself in an embarrassing position.

Dr. Kurtzman’s admirable frankness to students set a ﬁne example
for other administrators to follow. In addition to setting time aside to
discuss important issues with Pitt News reporters, as most administrators
do, our Chancellor readily takes that next step and levels with them.

This is not so commonplace at this University, where many admin-
istrators arbitrarily designate information as “conﬁdential” and “off-limits
to students” when this information vitally aﬁects us. ~

By withholding facts that concern the student body from student

in responsible positions and from our student press, these administrators
have encouraged a formidable communications barrier that cannot be
easily overcome. '

The communications problem cannot be insurmountable, however,

if administrators follow the example set -by our highest-ranking adminis-

of ideas.

_ If the voice of men on the
topic is to be heard, a poll

statements by elected repre-
sentatives. This poll could
be taken as "a function of the

since MC could not claim any
governing power, it could

not implement its opinions

binding on University men.

It seems to this author
ridiculous to elect .a body of

CERTAINLY, THIS col-
umn is not meant to be a
deﬁnitive, ﬁnal answer to the
original question. However,
it is an answer which seems
to me to be most practical in
terms of fulﬁlling student
needs. The function of pro-
gramming, described as the
“ﬁrst level” above, is one of

prime importance. Any other

claims as to the role of the
Council appear, at this point,
only to be attempts to save
What claimed to be a major
student organization.

MC as _a committee, work-
ing with the Dean of Men’s
office, coordinating and ini-
tiating programs of vital con-‘
cern to men on this campus
would fulﬁll an obvious need.
MC’s position as a major or-
ganization should be retain-
ed or loss in accordance with
the extent and worth of the
programs it handles, as de-
termined by the Recognitions

When MC’s deadline for

tution comes Oct. 2, it will
be interesting to see if it
seeks to fulﬁll an honest stu-

'_ dent need or tries to apolo-

gize for itself by scaring up

Letters to

Professor Rebuts

Buerger’s Letter

Editor, The Pitt News: _
As a faculty member of the
Department of Fine Arts, Uni-

\versity of Pittsburgh, I feel I

must now make some statement
regarding the controversy over
the Fine Arts Building which
has become a matter of such
Wide public attention. I have
come to this decision because
of. the ill-advised remarks that
have been published by David
Buerger, attorney and —_ spokes-
man for Miss Helen Clay Frick,

‘in The Pitt News (Vol. 61, No.
' 71, Friday, 24 February, 1967,

p 4), the University's student
publication, and which can only
be interpreted as derogatory to
the chairman of my department:
Professor William C. Loerke.
Professor Loerke and I both
came to" the University about
‘the same time, some three years
ago. Throughout this period one
of the main concerns of -the de-
partment ‘has been the effect on
our students of the tensions that
developed as plans for the Fine
Arts Building and its adminis-
tration began to be formulated.
These students are young, eager
for education, and looking to a
responsible administration for
guidance. For some time they
have been caught in the cross-
Iﬁre of this unfortunate affair.
"It is my direct observation of
the reactions of a number of

them, which leads me to say '

that Mr. Buerger’s letter to The
Pitt News, coming as it does
from a supposedly responsible

member of the bar, shocked and ~

disgusted these young people as
nothing else could have done.
If they were ever in any doubt
as to the merits of the issues
raised by the parties involved,
the tone of Mr. Buerger’s letter
resolved these doubts. Many of
them have told me so.
Professor Loerke’s qualiﬁca-
tions as a scholar and "a teacher
are impeccable, his behavior in
a situation which has been try-
ing in the extreme’ has been
ethical, and his courage in stand‘-
ing his ground against an un-
warranted attack needs no de-
fense, least of all from me. A
majority of my colleagues on
the faculty are overwhelmingly
in support of the stand taken
by the University and have so
expressed themselves in. open
forum. I believe the community
is beginning to realize that the
main issue is not a building or
ound, it . _stands,

holdings aside) is composed en-
tirely of its administration, fac-
ulty, and student body. The two
former should be the best that
the institution can obtain, the

llllllllllllllllll

.latter should receive the best

that it is within such a faculty
to give.

Any thinking person, reducing
this controversy to its basic is-
sues, can only come to certain
logical conclusions: That no re-
sponsible administrator, such as
Chancellor Kurtzman has amply

.proven himself to be, would

have reached the decision he
came to without extremely‘care-
ful consideration and thorough
investigation of, all the legal and
ethical points involved. As a
member of the Department of

"Fine Arts, I can say of my own

knowledge that he did just that.
Therefore, [the ugly term “welsh-
ing” applied by Mr. Buerger on
yet another occasion to the ac-
tions taken by the University
on the advice of its own re-

. spected counsel, ‘cannot apply,

should not have been used, and
ought to be withdrawn. No de-
cision of such» magnitude (con-
cerning, it is said, millions of
dollars) could be or was made

Vwithout the knowledge and con-

sent of the Board of Trustees
of the University and the ap-
proval of the Faculty Senate.
Thus it was a University deci-
sion, not the lone action of a

" chancellor, a clean, or a chair-

man.

The students themselves can
best attest to the many positive
gains that have been made in
spite of the circumstances. Sev-
era] of them have published im-
portant articles in scholarly pub-
lications, others have good posi-
tions in respected schools and
museums. An important art col-
lection has been made available

to our graduate students for-

study and ﬁnancial support has
come to the department through
the Mellon Foundation. Impor-
tant contributions in the form
of monies to defray costs of
equipment have been made by
several donors. I could continue
but see no need to do so, most
of these beneﬁts are visible.
The allegations and insinua-
tions that have been published
over the signatures of Mr, Buer-
ger and 'Professor—Emeritus Ho-
vey stand on their own merits
or demerits. The University has
acted with admirable restraint

"in not replying in kind, and the

public is free to form its own
conclusions. I

Sharpsville Day Honored

The Pittsburgh Council for South Africa is acknowledg-
ing Sharpsville Day this Tuesday with a program at 4:30
p.m. at the Lutheran Center. The holiday is in commemora-
tion of shooting at Sharpsville. This occurred in March
of 1960, when a peaceful -demonstration against the pass laws
in South Africa was fired on by South African Police. More
than 250 people were hit by ‘bullets at that time, and 64 were

killed.

The program will begin at the
Luthern Center with a speech
by the Rev. James Robinson. It
will be followed by an hour's
march to the Bethel AME
Church at 2720 Webster Ave. A
light dinner will ‘be served there.

After the dinner there will be

a talk by Leslie Rubin, a for- '

mer representative of .the Afri-
cans in the ‘South African Par-
liament. He will speak on Amer-
ican economic involvement in
the Union of South Africa. The
program will conclude with a

Happy when they phased out, Bemis soon “realized

Fundamentals  

Key To Big
Mitt Season

by MIKE BROURMAN

With the baseball season,

only two weeks away, coach
Bobby Lewis still has his
team working on the fundamen-
tals of the game. And it is on
two of these fundamentals, hit-
ting and pitching, -that Lewis
believes a successful season
rides. _

Last year the ‘mitters batted
.237 as a team while their op-
ponents would manage only .213.
Still, the mitters were outscored
and ﬁnished with an 8-10 mark.
The reason, according to Lewis
was, “we left too many men on
base. It was terrible, just ter-
rible!” ‘

“We’d have men/on second
and third with nobody out and
not score. It was deﬁnitely our
downfall. If we’d have scored
half of them, we'd have had a—
tremendous season.”

which was responsible for last
year is back this season, but
Lewis promises that things will
be different. “We’re going to get
them in this year. You can be
sure of that."

The other half of the “prob-
lem is pitching. Already Lewis
has lost the services of two of
last season's hurlers, Bob Shields
and Jim Clister, with injuries.

“But the schedule will ‘help
here,” smiles Lewis.-“Very few
times do we play a bunch of
games together. It'll give us a
chance to go with Dave Welty

and Don Stock most of the
way.” ‘

Still, Lewis knows there will
be games when he needs other
pitchers’. Two sophomores are
in line for the openings. One is
Bill Tress who pitched Kiski
Area to the WPIAL champion-
ship last year. The other is Den-
ny Wingertsahn, who accom-
lished a similar feat for St. Basil
in the Catholic League. “They’re
a little green,” says Lewis, “but
they've got the tools. They’ll
come through for us.” ’

blocking. And Hart, afterwards,
caught the spirit of the players.
“I’d bet everything I own this
is going to «be a vastly improved
team,” he said.

‘The attitude and the enthusi-
asm, despite the mud and the
cold, were probably the most

sized. “The squad showed more
*quickness, strength, and crisp-
ness plus ability than last year’s
team.”

Hart was especially pleased

back Mike Raklewicz, who had
a 30-yard burst up the middle
on play, and tailback Joe Jones
both impressed the coaches.
I Raklewicz, a bullish runner,
averaged 2.9 yards a carry in
his junior year. With more and
better outside speed in a couple
of sophomore halfbacks, the
middle could open up for him
to become one of the better full-
backs in the East.

TAILBACK JOE JONES showshis wares during Saturday’s two
hour scrimmage. Number 29, safety man Joe Curtin, moves in for
’ the tackle. Even the frigid 20 degree temperature didn’t stop the
Panthers. Today is the ﬁfth day of drills.

When it was all over Saturday, after the Panthers held
I a two hour scrimmage, head coach Dave Hart agreed with
his staff “these kids mean to have a football team next fall.”

It was an afternoon of crisp»

tackle. “Nice running Gary, that
away to go boy,” "boomed Hart’s
voice, echoing over the snow-
clad benches of Pitt Stadium.

Quarterback Bob Bazylak, spel-
led by sophs Jeff Barr, -Frank
-Gustine, and Chuck. Winters
paced the offense which ran
over 100 plays. “It might have
seemed that the quarterbacks
needed a lot of work,” Hart said,
.“but actually the muddy ﬁeld
hampered them.”

The Panthers ran from the
wing and pro set, as well as the
almost exclusively used “I” for-'
mation of last season.

Junior Skip‘ Orszulak, impres-

sive since switching from wing-‘”

back to split end this year, was
the only player not to see action.
He is out for 10 days with a
pulled hamstring muscle.

by DAN IlICI{’1‘ENSTEIN
Spring is supposed to bring
a resurgence of life and hope;

maybe it can do something
for the track team. The outdoor
season begins in two Weeks, and-
the tracksters might as well be
optimistic for they have no-
where to go but up.

As far as dual meet competi-
tion results, the indoor season
was a disaster. The team Won
one meet of ﬁve, They were out-
scored by their opponents 340-
155, a difference of over 100 per
cent. The worst loss came at
Annapolis where the Middies
crushed the tracksters 95-14.

The runners will meet the
powerful Navy team again on
April 1, for the ﬁrst outdoor
meet. That and the May 13 com-
petition with Wayne~‘State will
be the only'dual meets for the
summer. Otherwise, the cinder-
men will compete in three re-
lay meets and one quadrangu-
lar meet at Penn State with the
Nittahy Lions, Syracuse and
West Virginia. The IC4A East-
ern championship meet will
complete the outdoor season on
May 27.

The schedule favors the team
because their weaknesses will
not be so ~ apparent in the big
relay meets. Weak ﬁeld events
set the team back by about 30
points each indoor meet-—before

the rmmers could even warm

up. No pole vault entries meant
the automatic loss of nine points.
More emphasis is on actual run-
ning in the relay meets, how-
ever, so the team will be at
least even before the sprinting
begins. ~ I
The ﬁeld events will also help
in the smaller meets, this time
because of their increased
strength, Mark -‘Pollack and Dave
Hanosky did little in the indoor
shot put event. But according to
coach Jim Banner, both athletes

,are better discus throwers. The

discus is an outdoor event only.
In addition, sophomore Greg
Ellis, who broke the varsity in-
door shot put record, shows im-
provement every week. His out-
door_ performance should follow
this trend. Carl Wooten was out
for the indoor season after an
injury in the first meet. «He Will
be back to_ add strength to the
high jump and to the middle
distance running events. T

The team is healthy and moral
is high.A spring-like resurgence
is about due.
