conjunction with _Pitt’s Home-

The Gates/program council
agreement, it was reported in
Wednesday’s Pitt news, stipulated
the council, a non-profit organiza-
tion, would rent Carnegie Music
Hall for two nights, Friday and
Saturday, Oct. 13 and 14. The
agreement stated the council would
pick up the tab for the rental and
Gates would later reimburse the
council by check. v

Without the agreement. ‘Vance
said,‘Mangione would have appear-
ed in Pittsburgh but not at the
Carnegie Music Hall since his
management does, not meet Music
Hall regulations limiting rental to
non-profit organizations. Any
performance by Mangione would
then have been at another location

have had no relation to homecom-
ing, Vance said.

quoted A Bernita Mills, Carnegie
representative who arranged the
hall rental, as not being aware

stated Vance. “Mrs. Mills had
talked to his personal manager a
number of times.” ‘

T Jack Brown, the council advisor
who approved the Gates/council
agreement, justified the -pact earlier
this week by commenting: ‘‘(It) all
has to begin with renting the hall.”

Vance also said continued
criticism of council actions with the
scheduling ‘ of the homecoming
concert were unwarranted. -

concert was a problem. I thought.
we did an excellent job in handling
the Chuck Mangione concert, and
we are receiving nothing but
negative feedback.”

Willard Heaps,. _director of

both the Gates/ council agreement '

and-the council’s violation of an SGB
contract, which -holds the council to

like Imperial Chemical Industries

Terry Ellis, a senior. official of ..

Britain's National Westminster
Bank. , I — ,

They transact their business

where shirt-sleeved dealers are

It is a world in which millions of

Vance was particularly dissatis-I

using professional promoters when
scheduling concerts.

“I am convinced no arrangments
were made to circumvent any
guidelines. Ihave asked PUPC to tell
me how this happened. We are not in
favor of them producing any
concerts. I don’t think anything is
going to be solved in terms of ‘you

~ said, they said.’ My position is that

the whole thing was a mistake,”
Heaps said.
‘The controversy concerning the

, program council and its concert

booking procedures began at an oct.
24th Student Government Board
meeting of ‘H recognized student
organizations. At that meeting
council chairwoman Tammy Had-
dad argued against SGB member
Jan Medoff’s proposal that student
organizations be given the.option to
schedule concerts without the.
supervision of a professional
promoter. Currently, the council
must adhere to a SGB contract to
that effect. V
“Whenwe work with a promoter

concert, but when we back our own
concertslwe run the risk of wasting a
great deal of money—not our
money, but the money of every «

student within the University,” she . ,~

Music Committee Chairman Claims
2 Day Rental Necessary for Concert

Homecoming concert as an indica-
tor of the success that can be
achieved when dealing with a
promoter.

When it was pointed out after the
meeting that Gates Music’s func-
tion was essentially managerial,
Haddad said Gates operated in.
conjunction with the program
council in promotional activities.

‘.‘We thought there was no
(financial or legal) risk. The reason
why this yvas done is~because we
knew Mangione would see out,”
stated Haddad.

Particularly critical of the coun-
cil’s booking of Mangione without
using a promoter was the Black
Action Society. , At the SGB
assembly meeting Marc Holloway,
BAS chairman, stated BAS should
be permitted I to stage ‘concerts
without promoters or affiliation with
the program council. _

Although no official action has
been taken by SGB, the council or
the Office of Student Activities
about the situation, Brown, Haddad ~
and Vance have made a proposal to
subject all committee plans involv-
ing expenditures over $1,000 to a

vote by ‘the; council’s ‘ executive

committee.

7 State Liquor Stores increase siocksiorchrisimesl,

By The Associated Press

 HARRISBURG—Amid all the

’bad economic news from around’

the world, the state Liquor Control
Board had good news yesterday for
anxious Christmas and New Year’s
holiday revelers. There should be
plenty‘ of booze in State Stores this
year. .
“We hope there’ll
shortage,” said Thomas Patrick,
the LCB’s director of liquor
purchases.

,He said inventories are up over
last year, when shortages through;

be no’

out the holiday period forced
grumbling customers to do without
or head for the nearest-liquor store
across ‘the state line.

Patrick said the LCB started
buying 10 ‘percent heavier in
September and inventories now
stand ‘at about 101 million cases.
This time l_ast year, there were 88.7
million cases in the LCB’s four
warehouses and "730 stores.

“We hope we’ll have it all
covered,” he said in an interview

Senate committee investigating
LCB operations.‘ ’

“We certainly didn’t like what
we went through last year, with all
the .criticism. Some of it was our
fault, but not all of it was -our
fault,” he said.

Strikes, severe weather condi-
tions and persistent ‘shortages of
freight cars contributed to last
year’.s empty state store shelves,
he said. .

For example, he said, a shortage
developed in ‘one’ variety of
imported liquor because four

container-loadscould not be
delivered from the Philadelphia

docks to the warehouse in Lebanon-

County‘.
Although supplies will be good,
-the LCB announced Wednesday
that prices were going ‘up, effective
Nov. 15, for 804 brands of liquors
and wines. ,
At the hearing, Chairman James
Kelley, D-Westmoreland,‘ asked
whether the LCB, the largest single
purchaser of liquor in the world,
has ever tried to pressure suppliers
into lowering ‘prices.

' afﬁrmation ‘policy, the" LCB“ is’

“No sir, we have not used our ’

clout to inﬂuence prices,” Patrick  

replied. . -
Despite its overall buying power,
the LCB is not necessarily the

largest buyer from individual“, 

producers and thus‘ can’t‘inﬂuence
prices, he said. . , .
But because of a nationwide

assured that no ‘ other state or

large-scale purchaser gets a bettqti I‘ 
Through that policy, the} ‘ P
LCB recovered $422,160 last fiscal ‘ ‘
year in overcharges and ‘discounts‘._ g

By The Associated Press

PHILADELPHIA—The gover-
nor’s race in Pennsylvania has’
become a rough and tumble affair,
with both major candidates putting
their money where their mouths
are—on radio and television.

Tune in during prime time any
night between now and next
Tuesday, Election Day, and you’ll
witness a classic political dogﬁght
with a lot of barking and snapping.

The expense is colossal——a
30-second spot can cost $6,000 in a
major market—but campaign‘
officials ‘agree that media advertis-
ing will mean the difference
between victory and defeat.

In the ﬁnal full week of the race,
Democrat Peter F. Flaherty has
pulled out all stops in an electronic
counterattack that attempts to link
his opponent, Republican Richard

‘ L. Thornburgh, to big money.

In iojne TV ad Flaherty says
Thornburgh received $200,000 from
Heinz family and
“$300,000 from the big money boys

I in western Pennsylvania...He

doesn’t want anyone to know who
owns him.”

Apparently smarting from a ﬂood
of newspape_r endorsements for
Thornburgh, Flaherty has taped

another ad saying he cut Pittsburgh
taxes by $73 million.
wonder that the only ones who like
Pete Flaherty ‘are the ones who pay
taxes,” an announcer says. _

One Flaherty radio ad was
inspired by a current Thornburgh
ad’ that has several Pittsburghers
criticizing F laherty’s resignation as
deputy U.S. Attorney General to
run for governor. ’

The Flaherty production purports
to eavesdrop on Thornburgh
campaign officials, one of whom
wonders aloud where they’ll ﬁnd
ﬁve Pittsburgh residents unhappy
with Flaherty. “When he ran for
re-election for mayor, he only got 88
percent of the vote,”' another
ofﬁcial pipes up.‘ “There must be
someone out there.” Taking
advantage of the newspaper
support, Thornburgh has released
an ad that shows the logos of the
major Philadelphia and Pittsburgh
newspapers, with excerpts of their
endorsements ﬂashed across the
bottom of the screen.

.Another one ‘shows Thornburgh
in front of book-lined shelves,
saying, “I was thetirst persons to
successfully prosecute corruption in
the Shapp administration.” .

_ Flaherty’s $400,000 media cam-

“It’s no_

paign was created by Elliott Curson,
a Philadelphia ad man who normally
champions Republicans.

Thornburgh has spent about
$725,000 on his broadcast ads, his
staff says.

In an interview this week, Curson
called Thornburgh “the master of
the low blow” "for attacks on
Flaherty "claims that he cut taxes
and spending while mayor of
Pittsburgh. ‘I

When asked whether Flaherty’s is

new ads were not personal attacks,
Curson chuckled, ‘and replied:
“They're a professional attack, not
personal.” V

’ With more money than Flaherty,
Thornburgh got the bulk of his ads
on television several weeks before
Flaherty started his heavy advertis-
ing. Curson said those ads caused
Thornburgh to close within four
. percentage points of Flaherty in a
recent Gallup poll. ' ' .

“If we had had the money an
been on television early, Thorn-
burgh would not have picked up,”
Curson said. ‘-‘You,don’t spend the

reduce our budget. It would mean
that much loss in money (approxi-
mately $700,000) in. our budget,”
said Posvar. '

Posvar also said the University’s
total aid budget is $10 million to
$11 million ayear, with roughly $10
million in aid comingfrom other
sources.

Posvar said the University,
contrary to a recent editorial in the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, has
spoken out against the senatorial
scholarships because of their
political basis. He added the

_ The case of the Pitt'Union Program Council and
the scheduling of the Chuck Mangione concert
presents a murky muddle to most of- us. Concern

» , over the concert arrangements began after Student

z  Iranian Struggle Against the ‘Royal iDictat0rshzp ’  

massive struggles «and 

Government Board member Jan Medoff proposed an
amendment ‘to the council by-laws for consideration
by the SGB Assembly, a meeting of all represen-
tatives from all official student organizations held on
Oct. 26.

During the discussion‘ of the amendment, council
chairwoman Tammy Haddad argued against

- Medoff’ s proposal, and cited the Chuck Mangione
‘ concert as proof that using a promoter is the best way

to schedule concerts. Two days later on Oct. 27, it
became apparent that Haddad’s statement about the
Mangione concert was not entirely true. The
program council had arranged the concert with Gates
Music, Mangione’s personal manager, in violation of
‘a contract between the SGB and the Office of
Student Activities. -

On Nov. 1, a third impropriety surfaced when
Haddad admitted the council paid to use Carnegie

. promoter.

Music Hall on Oct. 13 and Oct. 14, but used it only
on Oct. 14 for the Mangione homecoming concert.“
On Oct. 13, the program council allowed Gates
Music to hold a concert in the hall. Gates agreed in

Va contract to reimburse the council for the cost of the

rental of the hall. n
This arrangement allowed Gates to use the hall,
which they would not have been allowed to rent
otherwise, since the music hall is usually open to non-
profit organizations only. It also allowed Gates
Music to hold a concert without making any im-

mediate cash outlay for rental of the music hall, and

as a result theprogram council, in effect, gave Gates
Music an interest-free loan whenit agreed to pay for
the rental of the hall Friday night. » . ‘

Today there comes another chapter in the program
council saga. Steve Vance, who heads the program

council’s Music Committee, said that the council had ._

to agree to rent the hall for Gates on Oct. 13 or
Mangione would not have come to Pittsburgh during
Pitt’s homecoming. ’
Throughout this series of revelations, contradic-
tory statements from different members of _ the
program council have been abundant. On Oct. 27 ,
Haddad said the contract between SGB and the Of-
free of Student Activities had been violated when the
council arranged the concert without a promoter.
Then Haddad modified her original statement» and
said that Gates Music could perhaps be considered a

campus advertising and paid for the costs for the
Oct. 13 concert, Gates could be called a promoter.
Another contradiction surfaced when statements
Haddad made to the SGB.and The Pitt News differed‘
significantly. ' According to "SGB President Josh
Baylson, Haddad told him the council paid for the
hall on Oct. 14 only. She later revealed in an inter-
view that the council rented the hall both Oct. 13 and

\

Page 6—Friday, November 3, 1978

Oct. 14. In both these cases, it seems Haddad has
been kept in the dark or has a very poor memory.

In light of these problems involving the program
council, we urge the SGB and the‘ Office of Student
Activities to.act immediately to open a public in-
vestigation of the council. When a council is en-
trusted with more than $100,000 of students funds
and serious. questions are raised about the group’s
behavior, all information about the council should be
aired. '

A reorganization of the council is necessary. The
proposal by the council that all expenditures over
$1,000 must be approved by the council’s executive
committee in the future is one change that is essen-
tial. The chairman of the program council should be
kept aware constantly of the "developments when

 major events are being organized to prevent the

fragmented decision-making process that now seems
to pervade the council.

She said that since Gates handled off- .

7,: By JOHN HESS

For nearly a year, mass violent
protests against‘ the Shah’s repres-
sive regime have broken out
throughout Iran. These recent
uprisings are, in fact, the turning

0. point for the Iranian people’s

wen,

twenty-ﬁve year struggle against a
regime notorious for its repression,
brutality, and submissiveness to
western interests.

This. royal dictatorship, imposed
on the Iranian people by a
CIA-engineered coup d’etat in

.1953, is kept in power by security
, forces trained and equipped by the
‘ U=.S. government and thousands of

its military‘ advisors there. During
this twenty-five years of dictator-

"ship, hundreds of thousands of

opposition people have undergone
the most barbaric tortures in the
regime’s prisons.

In order to keep his regime in

I i ‘ power, the Shah must rely on the

army and his military forces. In the
three years between 1973 and 1976
the United States alone sold $10.4
billion in arms to Iran. These
billions of dollars have not only
been used to oppress the Iranian
people, but are also used to
suppress other liberation move-
ments in the area. The massive

military intervention of the Shah in .

Oman, a strategically important
country in the Gulf area that was
under the domination of Britain for
many years is a vivid manifestation
of the role that this reactionary
regime plays in the area on behalf
of U.S. imperialism. In 1975-76,
when the Omani’s revolutionary
movement succeeded in liberating
parts of the country, over 30,000-of
the Shah’s U.S.-equipped troops
intervened and ‘played a major role
in temporarily containing the
movement:

While Iran's gigantic oil income
has been spent to equip the army
with the best U.S.-made weapons,

the people’s iriost basic needs have
not been ‘met. Presently, 65
percent of the population is
illiterate, and 57 percent of the
population live in towns that have
no health care facilities. -. In
addition, unbelievable corruption
of the bureaucratic organizations,
mainly of the court and ‘the Shah
himself, has resulted in economic
disaster and social inequalities.
Iranian people currently face both
rapidly rising prices and unemploy-
ment. Agriculture is so badly
neglected that Iran, formerly
self-sufficient, now imports more
than 90 percent of its agricultural
needs.

The major focus of the economy

has, in general, been an attempt to"

satisfy the consumption demands
of the Shah’s only‘ base of support,
the minority new "rich, particularly
miltiary elites. The Shah’s
economic progress has failed to
benefit the masses of the Iranian
people.‘ In fact, ‘the intent of the

.\>

Shah’s reformiplanvs,‘/the so-called /

“White Revolution” (meaning
bloodless) that began in 1962, has
been to open the country to the
domination by imperialism in

collaboration with a small domestic ’

exploiting class headed by the Shah
himself. . . 

The repressive conditions,
suppression of all criticism and
dissent,‘ the systematic use of
torture, the denial of basic human
rights, total lack, of education,

"housing, health and welfare for the

majority of the people, have fed the
opposition to the Shah and have
resulted in massive struggle of the

' Iranian people.a_gains't oppression

andinjustice. ., __ ,

Yet in- theface of these facts, the
big business press in the United
States has chosen two _tactics with
whichnto ﬁght the Iranian people.

_ First, the. press reports that
Anti-Shah demonstrators are
Moslem fanatics. opposed to, the

Shah’s ‘ so-called ‘ ‘liberalization’A"

and ..“modernization”’ programs.

. Late this summer, the U.S. press

reported that the burning ‘down of
the Iranian movie theater (where
450 pe_ople were killed) was the
result ofthe Moslem‘ extremists. In
fact, "the fire was planned and
carried out by the Shah’s regime,
with the aim of creating'interna-
tional public _opinion against‘ the
demonstrators. By putting‘ the
blame on religious fanatics, the
U.S. media tries to‘ portray the
Shah as a liberal man making ‘great
strides to modernize Iran, and the
hundreds of thousands of anti-Shah
demonstrators as misguided. The
U.S. media is doing this in order to
prepare the groundwork for U.S.
government intervention in support
of its royal servant.

The second tactic of the U.S.
media used to support the Shah is
to ignore all eventsthat counter the
image of the Shah as a progressive
leader. No mention is made of

strikes.
alone,

In the past few "weeks
tens of thousands of

workers, teachers, civil servants I

and students were on strike
throughout the entire country. The
people’s recent violent demonstra-
tions, such as attacking ‘numerous
military guard posts, police ‘sta-
tions and ‘tanks, and "bombing the
economic and ‘social basis of _U.S.
imperialism,. such as joint U.S.-
Iranian banks and companies, have
been completely ignored. '

-The active role of the progressive
revolutionary organizations ‘and

groups cannot‘ be underestimated

and are ‘indeed a reflection of the
most democratic demands of the
Iranian people. Indeed, the most
progressive elements’ of religious
leadership constantly raised the
slogan of total overthrow of ‘the
imperialist-backed regime ‘of the
Shah. However, slogans such as
“a republic of the people of Iran,
led bythe working ‘class, ’ ’. which
are strongly -supported by the
people, show the influence of
non-religious progressive leader-
ship. I

The Iranian people have long.

suffered a brutal’ dictatorship and
today are courageously struggling
against‘ it. The regime’s responses

Iran are torture, exile, ‘martial law
and massacres in the streets,
showingthe complete inability of
this regime and its imperialist
masters to contain the people’s
struggle’. We can be confident that
the Iranian people’s new revolu-
tionary movement will be victor-
ious. All democratic-minded and
justice-seeking people should
support Iranian people for \an
independent, democratic and pro-
gressive Iran.

_ Jone Fond~ci's Western Fi|m—.—-Comes a Flop

Comes a Horseman

 Directed by Alan J. Palmla
‘ii   Cinema

 

A e 7 Jane Fonda has an unprecedented three-picture hit
streak, with critical and box office successes in “Fun
With Dick and Jane,” “Julia” and “Coming Home.”
Now.Fonda is starring in “Comes A Horseman,” a

1; .  western about “real people.” "Three out of four isn't

f r‘ bad.

 “Comes a Horseman” is set in Montana during
" . World War II (rather ambiguously since the time

 5 period does not become apparent until halfway

through the picture). Fonda portrays Ellen Conners,
only daughter of a deceased cattle baron, ‘who is

V running her ranch with the sole aid of an aging
‘ cowpoke. Jacob Euwing (Jason Robards), who

 

 ‘ controls most of the area either through ownership or
politics, is out to forclose on Ellen’s mortgage and
.~ 1- ’ eitherturn her off her ranch or force her permission to

 drill f0!‘ Oil. thus destroying the ecological balance 0
 the. land.‘ '

-.'z..

 

  

I  Things are looking bleak, but along comes a.
 horseman -- in the form of a soldier named Frank
 Thorne (James Caan) -- and, after being grudgingly
 nursed to health by Ellen (Euwing has it in for him,

too), he agrees to help her out.

‘ - " ‘ Then the film turns in to a grade B western, updated

.'_7:._with a modern and liberated relationship between
f Y, . Ellen and Frank.

i V V Euwing is actually being manipulated by the bank,

3 , -‘-but he's got this obsession to ruin things for Ellen-

 

 . because, long- ago, her father won an important court

decision over him. Ellen detests Euwing because on
the day of said court decision, he informed her-father

-1 - that she had been having an affair with him (Euwing)

_, Pitt faces a must-lose situation.
 , ’ l The Panthers go into tomorrow’.s
‘ game at Syracuse needing not only a
victory for themselves, ‘ but also
. needing losses for many of the
,, teams ranked above them. Rated
 19th by the Associated Press, Pitt
will require such help from around
the country if its string of three
consecutive bowl appearances is not
to be broken.
The Orangemen (1-6) were given
. an excellent chance by many
preseason experts to make a bowl
appearance, but an injury to
quarterback Bill Hurley ended
those hopes.
“Everybody kind of knows the
saga,” said Syracuse cbach Frank
"Maloney. “We took the ball on our
first possession of the season,
marched right down the ﬁeld, and
on the seventh play our quarterback
got hurt. I “ ’
“When you lose a player of his
(Hurley's) magnitude, it creates a

‘(plot of» emotional and technical‘

" problems,” Maloney continued.
“You can't lose a spring like that
and expect the machine to keep

V running smoothly.”

Malonev will rely on Tim Wilson
to try: to move Syracuse's veer
offense on Pitt’s defense, which is

it ranked seventh in the nation against

.the'rush.

.“Wilson reminds me a lot of

. _ Hurley,” said Maloney. “He has

1 great feet and fine running ability.
'He’s got a lot of natural ability,
which is proven by the fact he was a

. defensive back last year. He only
palyed quarterback the last week of
spring camp this year.”

One of Wilson's primary object-
ives will beto get the ball to running

1.

back'Art Monk, the leading rusher_

and receiver for the Orangemen.
Monk is averaging better than 15
yards a reception, has gained 366
yards on the ground and is one of

Bemis Teaches Booters Bonessi, Thunberg To 5

By ANNA ARLOTTA
rm News sun Writer

What happens when you ﬁnd
.yourself playing college sports but
having to share that all-important

starting position?

The Pitt soccer‘ team has two
athletes who fall into that competi-
tive situation. The two athletes are
junior John Bonessi (with sopho-

more eligibility) and fresh/man Scott ,

Thunberg. Their aim is to win the
Panthers’ starting goalie spot.
Coach Leo Bemis has the
responsibility of deciding who will
start each game. Since there has
been no clear-cut choice, Bemis
considers both goalies equal.
“Considering the experience
they both had before coming to Pitt,
I think they've come along real
well," said Bemis. “They both

  Losses a ust

the greatest attention are pitchers
Tommy John, Jim Barr, Larry
Gura, Luis Tiant, Mike Marshall
and Elias Sosa; inﬁelders Darrell
Evans and ‘Lee Lacy and ‘outﬁelder
Billy North. _ ‘
These eligibles are a far cry from
the (available talent of the past two
seasons, when a total of 23 players
were awarded contracts of $1
million or more. In 1976, the new
millionaires included stars like
Reggie Jackson, Joey Rudi, Don

have good potential, and I believe if
they work hard, they can develop
into good college goalkeepers next
year.

“On one hand, Scott played high
school ball but has come up against
an entirely different game here at
Pitt,” Bemis continued. “John
didn't begin playing soccer until
after graduation so this year has
been his first real experience.”

Bonessi, who comes from
Washington (Pa.) High School, only
began playing soccer after gradua-
tion. Since coming to Pitt, Bonessi
has been up against little varsity
competition because of a dislocated
shoulder his freshman year and
playing 'behing veteran Frank
Bucci. Because of the injury,
Bonessi was given a red shirt,

I

Gullett, Gary Matthews, Rollie
Fingers and ' Bobby Grich. One
year later, the market was bullish
again with Richie Zisk, Larry Hisle,
Lyman Bostock, Rich Gossage and
Mike Torrez gaining ‘instant riches.

Hisle, vwho‘ rewarded Milwau-
kee’s ﬁnancial backing‘ with a
power-packed season in 1978, tops
the free-agent rolls with a six-year
contract worth $3.155 million. "Zisk
of Texas, another big run-producer
this past season, signed a_ 10-year

allowing him two more years of
eligibility.

Bonessi’s record is 3-3 this year;
he has given up seven goals and
recorded ‘a shutout against Penn
State. ‘

‘ ‘That win made the season much
more worthwhile,” said Bonessi.
“Knowing we can beat a team of the
caliber of Penn State shows the type
of ball we're capable" of playing.
Although everything fell in the right
places for us, we played a great
game and won.” I

Thunberg, with a 2-4 record,
gained both hiswins this season in
shutouts over Bethany and C-MU.
Thunberg, from Neshaminy High"
School in Levittown, Pa., played
high school soccer but found Pitt to
be a different form of play.

“In high school I came. from a

contract worth $2.955 million.
Jackson, who_has delivered the

New York Yankees the world

championship the last two seasons,

punches in next with a ﬁve-year '

contract totalling’ $2.9 million.
Then comes Oscar Gamble, signed
by San Diego for six years and

, $2.85 million but recently "traded to

Texas; the late Lyman Bostock (ﬁve
years and‘ $2.25 million), and
Wayne Garland (10 years and
$2.185 million).

Pather To eure qwl Bid    

, Bears To Replace Bulls in Baseball ’s Free Agent Draft

Zisk and ‘Garland,’ a pitcher for
Cleveland,‘ signed the longest
contracts, 10 years. Garland,
however, was sidelined most of this
season with a shoulder injury that
threatens his career and ‘points’ up
the risk of long-term agreements‘.

One of the results, however, of
freeagency is that top players are
signing ‘long-term contracts, bind-

»ing them to their teams and

keeping them off the auction block.

losing team,’ ’ said Thunberg. ‘,‘ We
only won three games in my last two
years there. When I came to Pitt, I
thought» we had a ood program,
much better than what hadknown
in high school. For the ﬁrst time in
my career I got special attention as a
goalie, which I think has helped me
tremendously.”

“I’ve learned a lot by playing
soccer at Pitt,” Bonessi agreed.
“The quality of play is getting much
better, and the team as a whole has
a better understanding of the game.

I saw a great defensive
improvement in the latter part of
last season, which carried over into

this year’s play. ”

“They (the defense) have saved

me a number of times,” said
Thunberg. “It’s nice to be playing

you- can depend on.”

[ Thunberg realizes. he has more
pressure to overcome since he is a

freshmanand hasn’t been greatly ‘
exposed to college ball. ,

“As a ﬁrst-year player, I still
have the freshman jitters, so my
play does have some inconsist-
ency, ” said Thunberg. ‘ ‘I think the
major thing I lack in college ball is
conﬁdence, and I believe this will
come to me with more experience. ”

Bonessi believes that with this
gaining of experience either goalie

can add to the improvement of

next season.

Every week Pitt awards helmet
decals to its players for making a big
play. Defensive tackle Bill Neill
received seven such awards for his
performance against Navy last
Saturday.

The sophomore recovered a
fumble, caused another, made six
tackles and assisted on two others,
forced an interception, broke up a
screen pass and set up a
quarterback sack.

“Bill played his best game, ” said

Syracuse‘ employs a ‘basic 4-3
defense and, like Navy, moves
around‘ quite a bit before the
ball is snapped. Tackle Willie

and safety Bob Arkeilpane are the

big play men for Maloney’s
defense. The Orange always has
been an aggressive team defen-

Pitt will be trying to gear up its
offense against a defense that has
allowed 216 points in seven games,

contests.‘ Mistakes have throttled
the Panther offense all season-

“We just weren’t‘ the team we
were all year at Maryland,‘’’ said
Pitt women's‘ tennis‘ coach Nancy
Gordon after the Panth_erettes’ 8-1
lossto the‘Lady Terps Wednesday.

The Pantherettes ﬁnished the .
3;?" season with an 8-4 record; the loss

to Maryland was the most lopsided
defeat of the ‘year. Last weekend
the Pantherettes captured fourth
place at the Salisbury State
Invitational’ Tournament ‘ behind
Penn ‘State, Maryland and ‘William
& Mary.

.The lone’ highlight in ‘Pitt’s’

encounter with‘ Maryland’ came
when Maria Paris’ defeated Su-
zanne ‘Green in ﬁrst singles.
I Gordon attributes the team's loss
to a combination of factors.

“The team was down because

player-of-the-week honors. Bill was
involved in more big plays than any
of our other defensive players. He
had an unusually high number of
big plays.”

“I was prepared,“ said Neill, in
his ﬁrst year as a full-time starter.
“I ‘had a pretty good idea of what
Navy would do, so Ijust went'after
them. A lot of it was preparation,
and a lot of it was determination to
get to the ball and make the play.”

Neill was happy with the way he
played but was disappointed the
Panthers lost, 21-11.

“Our defense did a good job,” he
said. “We held-them to 178 yards

playing  the game, Russell Carter
and Barry Compton will get their

The bottom line is not who plays

for the offense but how many points
the unit puts on the board.

“I hated to see us lose,” Neill
continued. ‘ ‘Annapolis isn’t too far
from my hometown (Collegeville,
Pa.). Some of my family came down
for the game.” 1

Neill doesn’t expect Syracuse,
Pitt’s next opponent, to be a
cakewalk.

“They run a lot of formations.
You never know what they’re going
to do. They also have a pretty good
offensive line.”

Satisfied by this year’s team’s_

performance, 'Gordon believes the
young ' Pantherettes will ‘do even

“I’m_ not disappointed; I thought
we had tough competition. ‘All of

she particularly would have liked to
have beaten Syracuse and Penn-

“We're lookingforward to the

I Safeties don’t often score touch-

downs, but it was Pittsburgh's

‘Donnie Shell who recovered a
fumble and charged 17 yards for the
ﬁnal score in a 27-24 win over
Kaiisas City last week.

“Everybody else was excited
about the touchdown, but I wasn't.

* I_was still scared; they still could
' make it close,” Shell said.

“I didn't want to get too happy. 1
had to go back on the ﬁeld, and I

I "couldn’t get too excited,” he said. .
"  "‘I feel that every day I go out is’

my best day,” said the 5-foot-11,

. a 190-pound regular.

Shell and Mike Wagner are the
Steelers’ last line of defense and
their value is reﬂected in team
statistics._ Wagner is‘ second in
tackles, while Shell is fourth.

Shell has recovered a fumble in
each of the last three games, and

t..- »‘ ,__ , ,.

he’s tied for second in quarterback
sacks with three, an unusual
number for someone who plays far
behind the line.

His performance this season may
vault him to All-Pro status.

“Donnie has been playing
exceptionally well. He always was
excellent supporting the run, and
now he’s adapting to the man-to-

man techniques,” said secondary
coach Woodie Widenhofer.

“He has the ability to become an
All-Pro. I wouldn’t trade him for
any defensive back in the league.
He can line up with a tight end and
press him. After a year of
experience, he’s coming into his
own, ’ ’ Widenhofer added.

Shell, who holds a masters

degree in guidance and counseling,
ﬁnds the All-Pro talk ﬂattering, but
not his major concern.

“I don’t have my sights set on
that. Ionly want to keep winning, to
help the team in whatever way I
can,” he said. '

Shell was born in Whitemire,
S.C., and received a scholarship to
South Carolina State. “Half for

certain days we couldn’t put the ball
in the net. I think if that improved,
the team as a whole would benefit
immensely. ” x

Thunberg believes much of- the
goalie improvement is taking place
because of the help of assistant
coach -Frank Bucci.

“I think Bucci’s great as a goalie

coach ‘ because he’s got exper-
ience,” said Thunberg. “He has
changed me from a, high school
player into a college athlete. In
those first two weeks of preseason
practice I went through an entire
transitional period in style.”

Now that the Panthers have only
two games left in their season, what
happens to the goalies in these last

two contests? According to Bemis,
Thunberg will start against Indiana
tonight, and Bonessi will be starting
against West Virginia next Wed-
nesday.

Tonight’s game against Indiana
at Pitt Stadium starts at 7 p.m.

football, half for baseball, ’ ’ he says.

He played center field on a
baseball team that produced two
major leaguers, Gene Richards of
San Diego and Willie Aikens of
California. ‘

‘ ‘There are times I think I should
have stayed in baseball,” he
quipped.

Shell joined the Steelers as a free
agent in 1974, when the players
strike kept rookies in camp longer
than usual. He caught Coach Chuck
Noll’s attention and became one of
14 rookies who survived the cuts.

Shell played on specialty teams
for three seasons and took over the
free safety job last year and moved

to strong safety when Wagner

suffered a neck injury.

‘ ‘Mike and I play both strong and
weak safety, depending on how
the other team lines up. It’s a plus
for the Steelers to have two players
like that,” he said.
