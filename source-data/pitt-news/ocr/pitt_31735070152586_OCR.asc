fraternities and sororities to raise money
as part of a 3 1/2-year pledge signed to the
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to raise about
$300,000 in that time span.

According to the foundation’s website,
cystic ﬁbrosis is a genetic disorder that
currently affects about 30,000 children

This summer, some Rutgers University stu-
dents can spend their nights in the library
watchingBeyoncé music videos without any
guilt.

Kevin Allred, a.Ph.D candidate and part-
time lecturer for the women’s and gender
studies program at Rutgers University in New
Brunswick, N.J., is offeringa course this sum-
mer called The Politics of Beyoncé. . ‘

Don’t let the name fool you. The students
won’t be studying whether or not “Beyoncé
for President, 2016” could become a reality,
but will instead use the international star as
a focus point to analyze the history of black
women in the United States and the history
of black feminism.

“All the songs [Beyoncé] puts out — when
examined in their historical context and ap-
plied to situations in different ways — pro.-
duce really interesting and political results,”
Allred said.

Frayda Cohen, a lecturer and under-
graduate adviser for Pitt’s women’s studies
program, said studying pop culture brings

1 education down from its ivory tower and

into everyday life. '
“It’s an important goal of a liberal arts

Association was charging for students to at-
tend the event, which violates a rule in the Al-
locations Manual stating that any event SGB
funds cannot include an admission charge
for Pitt students. _

“That was alarming because that’s one
of the No. 1 rules that we're not supposed to
break,” Harun said. .

The Facebook posts advertised the Mas-
querade Ball and listed tickets for $7~without
masks and $10 with masks.

The Masquerade Ball took placejan.‘ 18 in
the William Pitt Union. The event included
dinner and a dance. All proceeds from the
event went to the Pan Caribbean Partnership
against HIV and AIDS, an organization based
in the Caribbean and in Latin America that
works to reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS.

education to think critically about the soci-
ety that [students] live in,” Cohen said. “Pop
culture and, maybe, Beyoncé’ can be an im-
portant aspect for this to happen.” '

Allred said his students will study writ— '

ings from famous black feminists such as
bell hooks and Alice Walker to see how Be-_
yoncé’s music corresponds —-— or does not
correspond — to "black feministmessages.

‘A typical day in the class consists of an
analysis __of different concepts or political
statements in Beyoncé’s music videos, ac-
cording to Allred. A

“I chose Beyoncé because she has so much
power and control over her career and nar_-
rative,” he said. “She makes the choices and
is in charge of the whole thing. "That way, we
cantalkaboutintentionalityasbeing directly
linked to Beyoncé herse .”

_ Lately Beyoncé’s choices have stirred up
the water’ in feminism’s third wave. ‘

The artist sampled “We should all be
feminists,” a speech from feminist author
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Ted Talk in
2012, in her song ‘‘***Flawless.’’ ‘ '

The portion of Ac/lichie’s speech used in
the song says girls are taught to shrink them-

selves, limit their ambition and aspire to mar-

riage. Adichie says girls are taught not to be
sexual beings and deﬁnes a feminist as “the

Association and Student Government Board

person who believes in the social, political
and economic equality of the sexes.”

Beyoncé appears to make no effort toward V’
inhibiting her sexuality. Beyoncé’s oﬂicial '

YouTube channel lists the music video for
her song, “Partition,” as explicit content. She
also embraced her “B_ootylicious” body back
when shewas a member of Destiny’s Child.
Allred said “"°'°"Fla'wless” will"‘absol_utely”
be included on his syllabus and is a main part

_ of one ofhis presentations, “I woke up like
dis: The Feminist Politics of Black Female

Subjectivity in Beyoncé.” _

Allred called the song a shot against con-
sumerism and the music industry “by going
against the grain and determining what she
wanted in her song, danm the consequences.”

Although she’s the subject of a feminist
politics course, Beyoncé told British Vogue
that "she thinks the word feminist “can be
very extreme.”

Still, Beyoncé identiﬁed herself as a “mod- ~

.ern—day feminist” and said, “I do believe in
equality,” but added, “Why do you have to
choose what type of woman you are? Why
do you have to label yourself anything? I’m
just a woman, and I love being a woman.”
While there is discussion aboutwhether
Beyoncé is truly a feminist, Julie Beaulieu, a

“The question invites us to considerwhat
it means to be a feminist and why other pop
icons refuse to name themselves, as such,”
Beaulieu said. ,

Allred said many of his students became
interested in gender issues and feminism

In her case, Harun cited section 4.03 of

the Allocations Manual, which states:

“No admission fee will be approved to
generate ﬁmds for a donation, and the col-
lection of the donation may not be taken at
the door when entering so as to avoid any
inference that giving a donation is a pre-
condition for admittance. The collection of

Harun said based on the Facebook posts,

in 2005 and has grown every year. ‘

“I think that, traditionally, PDM has .

been seen as an all- Greek event. But I
think every year we’re moving away from
that,” Weston said. “And that’s something
I’m really excited about because it’s som'e-

PDM President Victoria Julian, a se-
nior majoring in biological science and
chemistry, said the dance marathon
raised $81,654.54 for the Cystic Fibro-
sis foundation this year, almost $20,000
more than last year’s number of $61,872.

Julian said PDM dancers participate
for all 24 hours, but moralers, students
who attend to support the dancers_from

. their respective’ organizations, dance for

one eight-hour shift.

Dancers paid $150 and moralers paid
$125 to participate, and the proceeds
went to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

Music genres featured throughout the
marathon also included songs from Dis-
ney movies, jazz, country and hits from
the early 2000s. ‘

This year, PDM introduced a new
event, an “a cappella off,” where two a

cappella groups on campus have a singing
competition. _

During techno hours from 12 a.m. to
4 a.m. Sunday, the crowd swelled and
the dancers moved energetically to the
music, despite having spent twelve hours
on the floor.

‘Sophomores Julie Bockman and
Mackenzie Baker who are afﬁliated with
the Theta Phi Alpha sorority both found
that after dancing for twelve hours, it was
problematic to mark the time.

“It’s like if you don’t look at your
clock, then it’s easier to pass the time,”
Bockman said. ’

' Baker agreed and said she had to put
her phone away because she kept looking
at it to check the time. * .

Dan Kelley, a freshman pledge at Kap-

but attended because he ‘had a personal

“My good friend’s little sister has CF.

’   Instagramz. promoting ﬁtness one

  post ata time

Sophia Al Rasheed
" Columnist

With great Internet freedom’
comes great Internet responsi-

bility: Try to limit antagonistic

attitude, especially when directly

criticizing a group.

Take a moment to appreci-
ate the relatively recent spike
in “ﬁtspiration” accounts on
Instagram. For those of you who
haven’t been exposed to this,
ﬁtspo accounts are essentially
Instagrams or blogs that post
exclusively to promote exercise

_ and a healthy lifestyle.

I recently found an article that

:

listed reasons Instagram ﬁtspi—
ration shouldn’t be encouraged.

Let me be clear: I really, really try

to avoid these amateur lists at all
costs, butthe curiosity of poten-
tially hearing an argument against
exercise led me to a prompt click.

The writer, Kayla I nglima,
started off her article claiming
that she recently took up a health-
ier lifestyle and didn’t exactly give
me the “I have an unhealthy life-
style, and my life is ﬁne!” procla-
mation I was hoping to read, but
she did provide a list of 11 poorly
reasoned points. Some of these
points include claiming. that the
accounts “make average people

think they are famous,” “make
their food look sad” and make
bodybuilders, like the ﬂexing
woman pictured alongside the
article, feel sexy.

First of all, it seems a bit hypo-
critical to claim that Instagram
has only one group trying to make
itself feel famous —— to what else
does the brag—inﬂuenced concept
of Instagram cater? But even if
we do grant this fame—seeking
exclusively to ﬁtspo accounts, I
think this critic should consider
the positive beneﬁts that these
inspirational accounts have on

followers and the beneﬁt that Instagram
has provided with these accounts.
There are a few topics that deﬁnitely are

’ valid to spread quickly among individu-

als, such as news, recipes and astrology,
which stand apart from the useless selﬁes
and pictures of chain food dishes that take
up the majority of our feeds. The reason

they stand in the former category is that

March 24, 2014 | The PiItl\Jevvs | \/\/\/\/\/\/.plliﬂeWS.COm.

they give viewers an opportunity to change

, something about themselves. Whether they

offer us knowledge about what’s going on in
our world, a way to change our meals or an
opportunity to reﬁne our opinions, these
Internet spaces inspire us to change along-
side each other instead of simply receiving
lik_es for what we’re doing or criticizing
others for their positions.

That’s what.ﬁtspo accounts do. Going

along with the agenda that many Ameri-

cans took after years of hearing about how
unhealthy their lifestyle is — think the

H “Supersize Me” era — -many decided to
‘use this as an opportunity to change. These
accounts.don’t simply create a cult of extra-
ﬁt bodybuilders who dedicate their time to
nothing but ﬁtness, as Elite Daily implied.
They post recipes, exercises and legiti-
mate forms of inspiration that attempt to
encourage us, including average Joes like A
me, to adopt or maintain a healthy lifestyle.

For example, you might be familiar with
“Transformation Tuesdays,” a trend that
showcases those with incredible before and
after pictures, created by hard work and of— .

tentimes helped bythe motivation provid-
ed through ﬁtspo accounts. In the middle of
a day of mindless scrolling through social
media, what’s wrong with a few positive
messages about positive changes?
Granted, there is a signiﬁcant number

of people who simply use the Internet to —

showcase for the sake of showcasing — like
the ones on this list from Elite Daily. But
to those who are striving to bring about a
positive change to your lifestyle, save the
anger forthe gym. I

The Florida Gators had the ball with
3.5 seconds left in the ﬁrst half with a
two-point lead. It was inboundedbehind
halfcourt to Scottie Wilbekin, who in-

stantly drove past Pitt guard Chris Jones, ‘

launched off one foot and hit a buzzer-
beating 3—pointer as time expired to put
his team up by ﬁve at the half.

It wasn’t a deciding blow, like a num-
ber of the shots sunk against Pitt this
season, but the SEC Player of the _Year
himself thought that'it boosted his team
to the Gators’ 61-45 victory against the
Panthers in the third round of the NCAA
Tournament. "

SPORTS  

‘Pitt’s season ends with loss to Florida Gators in round of 32

Against the tournament’s No. 1 overall

' seed, the Panthers held their own for a

while and led 15-13 at one .point in the

A ﬁrst half. But Florida’s more athletic and-

talented players eventually took over the
game in the second half.

~“They outplayed us,” senior forward
Talib Zanna said. “They out—executed,
everything. They got to the loose balls.

.We didn’t get it done.”

Zanna and redshirt senior Lamar
Patterson played in their ﬁnal game as
Panthers on Saturday afternoon at the
Amway Center in Orlando, Fla., and Zan-
na was the only player to reach double
ﬁgures with 10'points. Patterson ﬁnished

with eight on 3—of-11 shooting, including

1—of—7 from 3-point range.

Behind -its leading scorers, Pitt’s
offense also struggled against the Ga-
tors’ defense. Pitt shot just 37.3 percent
from the ﬁeld and posted 14 assists to 11
turnovers, an abnormally low assist-to-
turnover ratio from a Pitt team.

‘Pitt head coachjamie Dixon credited
Florida’s age as a factor behind the Ga-
to‘rs being the best defensive team his
Pa-nth'ers have played all year.

3 “Generally your older guys are your
best defenders,” Dixon said. “I think
their physicality is evident, and like I
said, they’re the most physical team we’ve
played all year long.”

In the.paint, Zanna and the rest of the

Panthers were challenged by the likes of ‘

Patric Young, Casey Prather and Dorian

Finney-Smith. Young and Finney-Smith
tied for the game’s lead with eight re-

_ bounds apiece, while Prather pulled down

six himself.

The trio played an integral role in the
Gators’ advantage on the glass as they
out—rebounded Pitt 38-31.

And from the pe_rimeter, Wilbekin
led all scorers with 21 points on 9-of—15

” shooting. Of his points, 13 came in the

game’s ﬁnal six minutes as the senior
guard scored at will late in the game,
twisting through driving lanes and throw-
ing in off—balance shot attempts.

“I would say that it just happened,”
Wilbekin said about his late scoring run.

Tyler Wilps became Pitt’s 75th All—American
with his seventh-place ﬁnish, but three other
Panthers fell just one win shy of joining Wilps
as the Pitt wrestling team ﬁnished 22nd in the
team standings at the NCAA Tournament this
weekend in Oklahoma City.

As ateam, the Panthers also came up shy
of their own expectations. Pitt ﬁnished the
regular season ranked No. 10 in the coaches’
poll, which ranks teams based on their dual-
meet accomplishments.

Because of the tournament’s scoring sys-
tem, which favors bonus point wins and indi-
vidual success over wins and team depth, the

Panthers ﬁnished behind ﬁve teams that they i

beat in the regular season: No. 3 Oklahoma
State, No. 8 Virginia Tech, No. 18 Lehigh, No.

19 North Carolina State and No. 20 Maryland.

“As a team, we expected more from our-

selves,” senior Anthony Zanetta said. “We

The Pitt baseball team maintained its
momentum from a pair of wins during
mid-week play as the Panthers swept the
Duke Blue Devils on Friday and Saturday.
After his team was swept a week ago in

Blacksburg, Va.’, against the Virginia Tech _

Hokies, Pitt head coachjoe Jordano said
this was a “great week” for the Panthers.
“We ‘were 5—o_.this week,-and really

played well‘ after,{coiiiingv5jo'ff,;of a disap-h ‘
pointing weekend last weeken'd,”_]ordano‘

said. 7“This team really battled back and
played well the entire week. We just beat
a very good baseball team, and they’re
going to be right there at the end. We’re
very pleased with where wefre at.” I

‘Pitt (12-10, 4-5 ACC) is now on a ﬁve-

game winning streak, but remains tied’

for last place in the ‘conference’s Coastal
Division with Duke (14-11, 4-5 ACC).

team at nationals. We strive to not only make
our fans, but every wrestling fan in the nation
recognize and respectlus.”

But Wilps’ performance alleviated some
of that sting. He won his ﬁrst two matches
before losing 5-2 to eventual national runner-
up Andrew Howe. He bounced back with a
3-2 win in wrestlebacks — which is akin
to a consolation round -— to earn his All-
American status. .

“It felt good when I ﬁnally'got up [to the
podium] ,” Wilps said. “Everyone’s applaud-
ing the All—Americans, and that feels good.”

. He ﬁnished with a4-2 win in the seventh-
place match over California State—Bakers-
ﬁeld’s Bryce Hammond after losing in the
consolation semiﬁnals.

Senior 125-pound Zanetta, sophomore
197-pound Nick Bonaccorsi and junior

184—pound Max Thomusseit all lost in the
round of 12 and were just one win shy of
guaranteeing a-top-eight ﬁnish and the All-
American title. ’ .

Zanetta, in his fourth trip to the NCAA
Tournament, scored a pin in his opening
match before falling in the second round.
The senior fought back with two wins in
wrestlebacks before losing 8-5 in the round
of 12.

and heavyweight P.j. Tasser went 1-2_ at the
national tournament, but Tasser still left the
tournament with a positive outlook.

. “It means the world to me to ﬁnish my .

career at NCAAs,” Tasser said. “Obviously,
I didn’t stand on the podium like I dreamed
about as a kid, but the past ﬁve years have
been one heck. of a ride.” - ' -
Pitt’s freshman qualiﬁers,‘141-pound Ed-
gar Bright and 149-Pound Mikey Racciato,
alsofailed to advance far in the tournament.
Bright won his ﬁrst match and then lost his

Fellow seniors 133—pound Shelton Mack

next two to end his ﬁrst tournament. Rac-
ciato lost both of his matches in Oklahoma
City. . y .

“I think [the dual-season record] shows
how dangerous and young this team is,”
Tasser said. “We didn’t have the best tour-

nament, but ﬁve of the eight qualiﬁers are

returning. That’sa good start. This program
is headed in the right direction.” ‘

In his second national tournament,
Bonaccorsi lost a tough match to Virginia
'I_‘ech’s Chris Penny 3-1 in the ﬁrst round. The
sophomore strung together three straight
wins to put himself in a match to wrestle
for All-American status. Bonaccorsi lost
4-0 to Duke’s Conner Hartmarm to end his
sophomore season. _

Thomusseit entered the national tour-
nament as. Pitt’s best chance at All-Amer-
ican status and a national title, but the
184-pounder was upset in the second round
by Old Dominion’s__]ack Dechow 3-_1._

Thomusseit fought back withtwo wins in

wrestlebacks before a 6-5 loss to Minnesota’s
Kevin Steinhaus in the round of 12 ﬁghting
for All-American status. ' ‘

Along with fellow junior Wilps, Thomus-
seit will be highly ranked entering 2015 for
Pitt, giving the Panthers two legitimate na-
tional title contenders next season. _

“I think I’ll take about a week or two off
and then I’ll be right back at it every day,”
Wilps said. “I’ve set my sights next year on
being a national champion.”

With Wilps and Thomusseit leading the
way, along with the three underclassmen
who got tournament experience this year,
the seniors believe that Pitt wrestling has
better days in its ﬁxture.

“I think there are plenty more positives
to come from the program and the under-
classmen on the team,” Zanetta said. “They
must realize the NCAA tournament is an op-
portunity to create a lega'cy- for themselves
and the team’. andzthey .ca-n’t.1et.tha.t slip
away from them.” I

ing their own bats time enough to erase
a late deﬁcit.

Pitt took a 1-0 lead with Mattjohnson
scoring an unearned run after he reached
on an error, then scored on a passed ball.

That lead lasted until the top of the
ﬁfth, when Duke pushed a pair of runs

across with some opportunistic hitting

early in the frame. Matt Berezo worked
Aldenhoven into a 3-1 hitter’s count, then
singled to right to lead off the inning.

The next batter, Ryan Deitrich, sent the
third pitch Aldenhoven offered him over
the left-ﬁeld wall to put the Blue Devils
up 2-1. "

Duke then loaded the bases that same
inning, but Aldenhoven escaped the jam
by striking Chris Marconcini out to end
the frame. Aldenhoven tossed two more
scoreless frames, allowing only a pair of
hits. , '

After falling behind, the Panthers
quickly tied the contest again in the bot-

tom half of the ﬁfth afterjordan Frabasilio ‘

andjohnson led off with singles. Frabasilio
scored on a wild pitch to tie the game at
2-2 after moving to third on a bunt by
catcher Manny Pazos. .

In the next frame, Casey Roche worked
a leadoff walk then made his way around
the ‘basepaths, eventually scoring from
second dn an RBI single from Frabasilio
for a 3-2 Panther lead. ~

Out of the bullpen, Sam Mersing al-
lowed one run in the eighth, butjon Dan—
ielczyk closed the game with 1 2/3 of an
inning’s work for his ﬁrst save of the year.

Game 2: Pitt 5, Duke 1

The Panthers moved their win-loss
record above the .500 mark Saturday by
taking control of the game early.

After the Blue Devils took a 1-0 lead
in the ﬁrst inning on a balk by starterjoe
Harvey, Pitt responded with three runs in
the bottom of the frame. Once Pitt had the

lead, it never gave it back as the pitching
staff kept Duke off the board for the game’s '

ﬁnal eight innings.

Harvey (1-1) earned his ﬁrst win of the
year by allowing one run on ﬁve hits over
6 2/3 innings. He struck out a career-high
eight batters and walked three.

From the bullpen, Hobie Harris threw
2 1/3 innings for his second save of the
season.

Pitt sent nine men to the plate in the
ﬁrst inning and received run-scoring hits
from Roche, Frabasilio and Eric ‘Hess as
the Panthers got hits early and often off
against Duke starter Andrew Istler..

The Panthers added another run in the
second after Stephen Vranka led off with
a double to left, then scored on a sacriﬁce
ﬂy off the hat of B00 Vazquez. They added
one more insurance run in the eighth with
an RBI single from Dylan Wolsonovich to
score Frabasilio. '

Game 3: Pitt 8, Duke 5

Pitt faced a three-run deﬁcit after two

' innings of play in the nightcap of Satur-

day’s doubleheader, but used. a ﬁve-run
ﬁfth inning to take the lead for good and
secure a sweep of the Blue Devils.

The outset looked grim for the Pan-
thers, as Matt Wotherspoon continued
to struggle while Duke starter Michael
Matuella struck out ﬁve Panthers in the
game’s ﬁrst two innings. Wotherspoon
lasted just 3 2/3 and gave up four runs on
seven hits and three walks.

Fortunatelyfor the Panthers, Matu-
ella was pulled from the game after two
innings, and Pitt’s offense went to work
against Duke reliever Dillon Haviland. The/*
Panthers scored two runs in the third to
cut Duke’s deﬁcit to one run, but Haviland

‘ couldn’t get an out in the ﬁfth and blew a

4-2 Duke lead after the Blue Devils scored
one in the fourth.
The ﬁrst four hitters of the inning

reached base, and the Panthers continued ~

to rap out run—scoring base hits through-
out the frame to overcome their deﬁcit
and take a 7-4 lead.

Duke scored a run in the next frame,
but Pitt countered with one more and the
ﬁnal margin of 8-5 held for the game’s ﬁnal
three innings. I
