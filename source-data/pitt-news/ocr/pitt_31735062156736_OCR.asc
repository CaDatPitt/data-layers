Comes the pep rally today, the
Panther will have something new
to growl about.

Newest addition to the ‘fur-
bearing mascot. is a simulated
Panther head ~- complete with a
movable jaw that jabbers when
the inside man, Jack Grimes,
babbles at the women and the
players at the games.

A creation straight from Car-
negie Museum, the new head was
designed by Reinhold L. Fricky,

and utilizes real mountain lion
skin to match the body of the
suit.

The eyes are made or glass. the
teeth are formed from porcelain,
and the whiskers were plucked
fresh from a g0ose’s tail.

Inside the head is a football
helmet and a chin strap that ren-
der the jaw movable.

Bob Prince, an alleged radio
announcer, who has the Case of
Sports program on WJAS, is the
master of ceremonies for the
“Claw the Irish” rally. At last
year’s Purdue rally, he proved to
be a top flight hopper-upper. The
barbs he tossed out dug deep and
spurred the Pantherites to all out
vocal volleys for the remainder
of the season.

Mentor Mike Milligan is mak-
ing his first appearance before the
student body as a whole. Accom-
panied by his stall? and the team
captains for the Notre Dame game,
they will try to pass on the hustle
that made such a battle out of the
Illinois game last week.

Limbering up their gyrations,
the varsity cheerleaders, captained
by Ralph Miller, will smooth out
the yells. On this year’s team are
Franklin Blackstone, Bernard Mal-
liger, Marshall Levy, Joseph Are-
na. and Anthony Barilar.

To aid the Pittites in shouting
down those pseudo-Pittsburghers
who root for Notre Dame, the
junior varsity is going to organize
the Pitt alumni into_ a cheering
block. These J.V.’s are Jack Baher,
Harold Reiehman, George Treush,

(Put Shoilt ’Em Anyway

Frank Leahy and his collection of All-
Americans appear tomorrow under the press
billing, “The Mythical Champions?’ of the
nation. L ‘

Pitt ’s showing against Illinois, although
somewhat impressive on the scoreboard, shows
that the Panthers are still a year or two away.
They may make a better showing against the
Notre Dame team than we expect. In any event,
the score should not be lopsided.

Whatever Pitt does, the large majority of
rooters will be for Notre Dame. Nothing that
an editorial, or a million editorials can say,
will change that condition. Pitt will be fortu-
nate if more than 11 or 12 thousand Pather
fans——counting the student body—turn out.
Out of some 60_ thousand, this is a distinct
minority. '-

The only thing we have to counteract a
“partisan” crowd is practiced cheering and
the color of a ﬁne marching band, a new cheer-
ing block. The first two points are sure; the
latter a guess. It will take the voices of
all then thousand students to surpass 50 thou-
sand ND fans. What will Pitt rooters do? We
hope there will be lots of hoarse throats to-
morrow night. ’ ’

Hurry Up. and Wait

Ever go to the library between classes to’
catch up on a little outside reading? Ever
get your book, or books, in less than ﬁfteen
minutes? If you did, you’re an exception.

Pitt’s a big school; its libraries are spread
over three Cathedral ﬂoors. Thousands of
books are shelved and catalogued on those
three ﬂoors. Therein lies the problem. How
to get those books to the undergraduates in,
the shortest possible time?

The Pitt conveyor system is an attempt to
solve the situation. Fifteen minutes, however,
is a lot of time lost when the student has only
an hour or less in" which to do his studying.
The system, in operation, defeats the idea of
student reading in the library. Students with
an hour to kill between classes scurry along

ﬁfteen minute wait for thirty minutes of read-

Elsewhere on this page may be found Har-
vard’s solution to the library problem. Har-
vard’s n may not be feasible at Pitt; the
conditions differ. Still, it is any attempt to
solve a similar problem. We think something
working toward the same end might be done
for the Pitt undergraduates.

Exit Pittpourri

Today marks some sort of celebration for
the New-s. In the right column of this page is
our ﬁrst try at maturity. -

Many readers will think that we have gon
highbrow, or its equivalent, in placing Pitt-
pouri in the obituary notes and substituting a
society column. Deﬁnitely, we have not. But
we do feel that a column written in the Pitt-
pouri style is no asset in a college newspaper
written for persons of college level.

In the past, all critical surveys of the News
indicate that it went “high school” in its
treatment of social events. This is no reﬂecttion
on past writers or editors—the students seem-
ed to want that sort of column.

Back in 1941, Rugy Aldisert published a
newspaper that, during the course of the year,
contained a few Pittpouris and many “Society
Items” columns. His newspaper was rated tops
on a nationwide scale. We would like to follow
in the man’s footsteps. ‘

For the next few weeks, then, the Pitt
News will carry “Socialight” to supplant Pitt-
pouri and Frat Facts. We are anxious to know
what thereader thinks about the experiment.

which the plan developed.

Construction of the new build-
ing, which is now underway, was
inade possible by the gift of
Thomas W. Lamont, for whom the
library is named.

Self-Service

The new library is designed as
a self-service institution. The usu-
al delay of checking books in and
out will be largely eliminated. The
student, entering the library,
passes through the book stacks,
and picks up his book on his way
to the reading room. Leaving the
library, he again’ passes through
the stacks and deposits his book
on the way. Only when a student
is taking a book from the building
will a check-out be necessary.

The reading rooms themselves
will contain no book shelves. They
are designed to provide a light
and pleasant setting for study.
Students will ﬁnd a choice of
working space -- easy chairs for
leisurely reading, and working
“stalls” where men can study and
take notes in privacy. There will
be room ‘for 270 students in
“stalls” and more than 10-0 stu-
dents in easy chairs at any time.

Includes Smoking Room ,

A smoking room, where stu-
dents may talk and relax from
their studies; will be provided on

Psychiatrists
A Necessity
For Colleges

Washington, D. C. (IP) Fifteen
per cent of all students in the na-
tion’s colleges need some kind of
psychiatric consultation or care,
the Committee on Mental Health
of the Third National Conference
on Health in Colleges announced.

The committee said that one-
third of these are urgent cases who
need help before they get into
trouble, another third have less
serious :n_euroses and maladjust-
ments and the rest can get along
without preventive psychiatry, but
would be better oif with it.

in the studies out of¢

each of_ the three reading ﬂoors
and the two mezzanies of the
building. In addition, a typewrit-
ing room will make it possible for
students to type notes directly
from books in the library.

The idea of a library designed
for undergraduate use was origi-
nated by Keyes D. ‘Metcalf, Li-
brarian of the University. Open-
ing of the Lamont Library, which
is planned for the fall of 1948,
will relieve present crowded con-
ditions in the present Widener
Library. This library will «con-
tinue as the University’s center of
scholarly research.

Storage Below Ground

In addition to three floors and
two mezzanines devoted to un-
dergraduate reading rooms, the
new "building will contain two
ﬂoors below ground devoted en-
-tirely to stack room for book stor-
age. On a top ﬂoor and elsewhere
in the building, 12 good-sized con-
ference rooms will provide class-
room space for“ Harvard’s new
program of General Education.

Editors Ask
Pay or Credit

Marietta, O. -— (IP) — Officers
of‘ the Ohio College Newspaper
Association report that the asso-
ciation at its last annual meeting,

them academic credit for the work
rendered or both.

The following recommendation
was also passed unanimously:
“Since it has been brought to our
attention that certain Ohio col-

newspaper editorial policies to the
extent of prohibiting such words
as ‘dancing’ and ‘smoking’ from

C, Debate and Fashion Parade Show
K-§Meri’rs of Long and ‘Short Skirts

\ By Marilyn Lipp ,

-.3“ “Everybody talks about the
weather, but nobody does any-
thing about it” is one of the most
common cliches used in literary
and non-literary circles.

Recently the saying has been
ivaried. Everybody is talking about
the new length in women’s skirts,
and nearly everyone has their own
plan for doing something about it.

. Some women are madly lenght-
, ening last year’s clothes; some are
forming picket lines in protest of

J‘-

the new style; some are screaming
vehemently “Just below the knee.”

.Y‘WCA to Hold Forum
Now the YWCA has decided to

step squarely into the middle of
the matter. As a part of its month-
ly membership meeting, which
stresses fashions through the years,
the Y will hold a forum on the
subject" of long versus short skirts.
In, this discussion, Elaine Saupp,
president of Women’s Speech As-
sociation, will act as moderator.
«Lou Guidish and Pat Cunningham
‘ 11 speak for the new styles; Joan
onis and Peggy Dailzy will dis-

_, ‘s the merits of the short skirt.
- *‘*- n addition to the forum, the
program includes a parade _ of
fashions,
Years”, to show the evolution of
skirt styles from 1860 to 1947.
Esther Da1t_o , narrator for the
"1"" evening, pla s to read excerpts
\‘ from Godey’s Ladies’ book and
I other style magazines of the var-
, ious times to explain further the

wicostumes of each period.

Q The meeting is scheduled" for
Tuesday, from 6 to 8 p. m. at the
Metropolitan Y on Dithridge St.
Although it is oﬂicially called a
membership party, Mrs. Edna T.
Batz, director of the YWCA, ex-
plains that the meeting is open to
all ‘girls who are interested.

This long versus short forum
will give all Pitt girls a chance
to get into the fray produced by
what is possibly the greatest fash-
ion A. revolution since they were
born. -. . .

New York Leads Change
,’ Ever since manufacturers dis-
' covered that retail markets were
sagging badly and that more cus-
tomers were needed to keep sales
‘ up to a normal level, existing
fashions have been in a precarious
condition. They were doomed com-
‘ pletely for the style-minded at the
spring showings in New York, the
most extravagant ever staged
there. . .
»The general keynote of the
showings seemed to be a complete
.'reversal of existing lines and
lengths. Shoulders were rounded,
waists were narrowed, and skirts
were lengthened. Buyers were
confused, but enthusiastic. They
~. bought the new styles, and the
._ war was on.

ized styles, made a general house-

Most Women'Protest

But most women were not so
easily captured by the whims of
New York designers and manufac-
turers. All over the country there
were reactions—parades of pro-
test in Texas, picket lines in Cal-
ifornia, “Just Below the Knee”
clubs everywhere. In Georgia,
even husbands organized against
the longer skirt.

But, women, being women are
beginning to weaken. Some who
were violently opposed at first are
now admitting that they believe
the new style to be graceful. Many
are even wearing the new lengths,
saying that they do it not because
they like them, but because they
want to be in style. That word
“Style” is short, but all-important
to many women.

Pitt Women Procrastinate

At Pitt, the situation is becom-
ing, to say the least, very inter-
esting. Some skirts are very short,
some are very long, but most are

still at the medium usually known
as happy. A few independents are

they can’t decide whether to take
the leap or not, so they lengthen
skirts an inch to show that they’re
in sympathy with the fad, even
though they haven’t the courage
to come out in skirts ten inches
from the ﬂoor.

Lately, the controversy has
spread to the men. For the most
part, their comments agree with
those of Sir Stafford Cripps, presi-
dent of the British Board of Trade,
who is ﬁghting the latest styles.
He says, “The shorter the skirt

the better, though there must be
some limits introduced by other
considerations.”

This battle between the old
and new fashions is one of the
greatest international stews of all
times, and the YWCA is hoping to
do something to clear the air on
campus. Do you believe that the
longer skirt is graceful—or do you
think it ‘makes a girl look like a
walking tent? Do you like the new
tulip look, or do you think it bears
more resemblance to a wilted
geranium? Come to the forum and

Enrollment
Changes Soon

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — (IP)—-
The throngs of youth seeking a
higher education in American ‘col-

leges will begin to. take on a new
complexion this fall.

During the past two years ex-
servicemen have formed virtual-
ly all of the skyrocketing increase
in college enrollments, but begin-
ning this year “non—veterans” (re-
cent high school graduates) and
women will make a decided come-
back, predicted- Dean Fred C.
Smith of the University of Ten-
nessee.

Colleges will continue to train
their large enrollments of veter-
ans this year and for several
years following, he asserted, but
the increase in veteran students
will be only about six per cent as
compared with a ten per cent in-
crease in non-veteran men and a
four per cent increase in women
students.

‘‘The percentage of increase is
already favoring the non—veterah
group, and of course will continue
to forge ahead. The peak of vet-
eran enrollment will be in 1950,”
he said.

Ed. 6 Opens
Three-Week
Rush Period

It’s every fraternity for itself as
of 8 a. m. Monday, Oct. 6," when
the freshman rushing period
opens.

According to Ned M-clntosh, ad-
visor to fraternities, there will be
estimated 16100 rushess who will
be wined, dined, invited to dances,

during the three-week rushing
period which lasts until Oct. 26
at 2 a. m.

These men may be rushed by
one or more of the 15 fraternities
on campus since all are now ac-
tive.

Week-End Events Only

This will be the second year for
the extended rushing period.,In
this system, rushing events are
held only on Friday and Satur-
day of each week. Under the old-
er week-long period, events were
held every day during the rush-
ing period and grades suffered as
a result. The new system correct-
ed this by spreading the events
such as dances, visiting the frater-
nity house, and being entertained
at meals over the Fridays and Sat-
urdays of a three week period.

week, is permitted and this may
be on either Friday or Saturday.
No freshman rushees may be an
overnight guest of a fraternity.
Silence Through Nov. 3

With the close of the rushing
period the silence period will be-
gin. This will last until 5 p. m.,
Monday, Nov. 3, and it will be
during this period that bids will
be made. If these bids are not ac-
cepted by the rushee before the
close of the silence period he will
not have another chance to do so
until Jan. 1, 1948.

Nearly 300 bids will be cleared
through the Dean of Men’s office
during the silence period. The ac-
ceptance or rejection of fraternity
bids will be announced by this
ofﬁce at the close of the silence
period Nov. 3, at 5 p. m. A

DeansLoWer Requirelments  
For Student Activities Card»

At a meeting on Tuesday, the University deans liberalized
the policy regarding the issuance of student activities cards.

I*‘or1nerly a fee of $15 was required from those who car-
ried less than a full academic program. Some students were
unable to obtain a full schedule this semester because courses
were_r-rot available. They were forced to take some credits at
other institutions. Students who carry eight hr more credits at

   

   

each credit hour toward the pur-
chase of an activities card.

This means that anyone carry-
ing 11 -/ credits may purchase a
ticket for $4. Students who wish
to obtain a ticket on this basis
should present their registration
cards at the Treasurer’s Office,
‘twenty-fourth ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral. '

The decision to liberalize the
minimum credit requirement for
activities tickets was reached, even
with the consideration that the
student section already is crowd-
ed, but the deans thought the ac-
tion necessary to be fair to all
students.

OKs Modern
Education

PORTLAND, Ore..-— (I.P.) -
Dean A. John Bartky of the Stan-
ford University» School of Educa-
tion had some unkind words to
say here about people who com-
pare unfavorably modern educa-
tional methods and those offered
by the armed forces. '

Speaking before the 15th annu-
al Stanford alumni conference
here, Dr. Bartky said that such
criticism shows that a person
knows little about education or
about military training as it was
developed during the war.

“Military training was simply
present day educational tech-
niques adapted to the Army and
Navy situation,” he pointed out.
“If military training was satisfac-
tory, then our present approach
to college education must be sat-
isfactory, for they were one and
the same thing,” he declared.

The Stanford dean also took is-
sue with the “intellectual who
wants more Aristotle in the uni-
versity curriculum. “He is just
about as sensible as thefootball
coach who studies Walter Camp
-to improve his team; the rules of
the game have been changed since
Walter Camp’s .day.

“So also have the rules of life
been radically altered since Aris-
totle; he says very little about
how to get out from under an
atomic bomb, or how to talk a
speed cop out of a ticket.”

Dean Bartky also set forth his
disagreement with “the academi-
cian who worships the college
subject.” He declared; “If it is
necessary to combine anthropol-
ogy,’ physiology, anatomy, soci-
ology, zoology, botany-paleont-
ology and a dozen other sacred
areas to see what makes us tick,
let’s do so«even if we lose some
of the artiﬁcial subject matter or-
ganizations which we have built
up,” he urged.

The story of “Spring Lake” is a

It is a turn of the century play,
featuring only costuming of that

Frosh Women
Learn Cheers

Freshmen women will not have
a valid reason for singing school
songs “out of key” after today. At
the open invitation of Custom’s

committee chairman, Audrey Wes-'

terman, a portion of the three
hundred freshmen women may
participate in the Custom’: Sing
this afternoon in Room 1928 CL7

At this session, members of the
Custom’s committee of WSGA
plan to lead the freshmen in
group singing of the University
songs, and to teach the plebes
the “yell how” of Pitt cheers.

Three hundred trained rooters
in the cheering block will add to
the volume of the songs and
cheers. It is the hope of Miss Wes-
terman that as many girls who
have time this afternoon will at-
tend, considering the opportunity
tc apply what is learned at the
Pitt-Notre Dame game tomorrow.

Those women who are unable to
attend the Sing today may partic-
ipate in a repeat of it on Monday
afternoon in 1228 C1. The same
program will prevail as did at the
ﬁrst session.

Frosh Prolong

Light onus

Ralph Mitterling and Doc Hart-
wig, coaches of freshman football,
are letting the ax hang on the
wall until they see more of the
present frosh crop.

Plans for scrimmage were sty-
mied early this week by a delay
in the arrival of helmets. Conse-
quently, the coaches have refus-
ed to comment on the players.
.“A player may look good in
light drills,” said Mitterling, “but
when the pressure is on, he shows
a reverse of form.”

Practice has been conﬁned to
signal drills, passing, punting,
light blocking, and other basic
fundamentals. More than 70 can-
didates continue to turn-out for
the daily sessions. Mitterling and
Hartwig are particularly anxious
to observe the All—State perform-
ers when the rough work begins.

Number One Irish Fan

Picks Pitt to Score

Myron Kopelman
“Notre Dame will beat Pitt by two or three touchdowns, but I

look for Pitt to score.” Speaking was George M. Wilson, downtown

clothing store proprietor and foremost authority on Notre Dame
football in the Pittsburgh district.

“The present Irish line is potentially the greatest in Notre Dame
history,” continued Wilson, who has already visited Frank Leahy’s
training camp. “The ends, Leon Hart and Jim Martin, are the ﬁnest
in the country. ’ '

“I think Tackle George Sullivan is just about as good as Tackle
George Connor who made All-American last year. The guards, Fischer
and Wendell are the best»in the business. ‘ '

“The unusual thing about the line .is its size. Usually, Notre
Dame guards are rather small, but this year’s line shows some big
boys in the middle. _

- “But the one important thing Frank Leahy lacks is a fast,
break—aWay runner——someone like Marchie Schwartz who played for
Notre Dame in 1930.”

Wilson has a high regard for Mike Milligan which leads him
‘to believe that the Panthers are
going to dish out plenty of trou-
ble. He credits Milligan with be-
ing “the success of last year’s
team.”

Digs Up Stars
Wilson’s interest in football was
ﬁrst stirred as an assistant foot-
ball manager at Notre Dame, from
which he was graduated in 1928.
Although graduated, he wished to
continue tolbe of some service to
his alma mater, so he tried his
hand at talent scouting.
, His success, however, was prac-
tically negligible until about 1937.
Since then he has dug up such,
stars as Johnny Lujack and Leon
Hart, the passing partnership that
Mike Milligan presently wishes
would catch the measles.
But Wilson missed out on one
prize catch — Lou Kusserow, Co-.
lumbia’s brilliant halfback.

Lost Kusserow

Wilson practically had Kusser-
ow’s bags packed when the Glass-
port boy was beckoned‘ by Uncle
Sam. The Navy took him and
farmed him out to Columbia

Fritz Wilson

where he became a fancy fur-
nishing in Lou Little’s backﬁeld.

Wilson sat in on last season’s
Notre Dame-‘Army scrap which
resulted in a scoreless tie. “The
teams were about even, but I do
think each overestimated the oth-
er. As a result, they played too
conservatively.”

The dapper clothier attends
four or ﬁve Notre Dame games
every season and justiﬁably lays
claim to the title of Pittsburgh’s
number one Irish rooter.

Calling All Cagers

They may be rushing the sea-
son, but the call is out for all
basketball candidates. Varsity
prospects are urged to report
to Head Coach Dr. H. C. Carl-
son at the Stadium gym, Mon-
day at 3 p. m. I

Golden Panthers
Shape Strategy
For Notre Dame

By Joe Santone

A light workout this afternoon
will conclude a week of hard work
for the Panthers in their prepara-
tion for tomorrow’s Notre Dame
battle.

Head Coach Mike Milligan start-
ed the week off with a scrimmage
on Monday. Mondays after a
game are usually reserved for
light practice and meditation over
Saturday’s boners.

Continue Fundamentals

Coach Milligan had the boys
continue practicing their funda-
mentals. He had the ends go-
ing down under punts, a notice-
able weakness in the Illini game.
The backs were also seen con-
centrating on their downﬁeld
blocking. V

Pitt is certainly offensive mind-
ed for a team whose only rated
chance is to keep the score down.
A number of razzle dazzle plays
have been added to the Pitt rep-
ertoire. Saturday’s game saw the
Panthers unleash only ﬁve plays
out of their bag.

Get New Gridders

Three new men made their ap-
pearances this week and all are
reckoned good enough to be heard
from soon. Don Fisher, a regular
in 1943, is rumored to be in front
line for a center job.

Fred Botti, a fullback from Con-
nellsville, is another promising
newcomer. Botti was also a mem-
ber of the 1943 team. Frank Co;
pello, a promising end from Ell-
wood City, never played high
school ball. However, he has been
showing a lot of promise this fall
and may land a sec-ond string
berth.

"Because of his performance in
last week’s tussle and during prac-
tice this week, Bill Hardesty is
slated to carry the burden of the
Panther punting. Bob Plotz will
repeat last week’s kickoff role.

This Irish trio will spearhead
tomorrow’s invasion in the Sta-
dium. George Connor, Giant tackle

young man, Frank Tripucka, of

season. The lad is regarded as an
especially deadly passer.

Ends Are Strong

Leon Hart, another local boy, is
receiving considerable mention for
his work around the terminal post.
Hart, only 19-years-old, comes
from Turtle Creek. Jim Martin, a
regular on the 1946 powerhouse
is receiving close competition for
Lhe other end from Douglas Way-
bright.

Any coach in the country would
trade his prize back for any one
of the Fighting lrish’s ﬁrst four
tackles. George Connor, unanimous
All-American and team captain
will be at the left side while an-
other regular, George ‘Sullivan,
will be at the right tackle.

Center George Strohmeyer, an
All-American on several teams last
year will repeat at that spot
again. The burly line backer is
rated as one of the best second-
ary defense men in the country.

Three Good Guards

Guard will be a tough spot for
Leahy. There he’ll have to make
a choice. His ﬁrst three candidates
are evenly matched. Bill Fischer
and Ziggy Czabroski will probably
open due to their greater exper-
ience. Marty Wendell, a capable
letterman, is the third man in
this trio.

Emil Sitko was hurt in a freak
acident. While dreaming of crack-
ing enemy lines, he rolled over and
caught his foot in a rung. The
result was a wrenched knee and
a doubtful starting chance.

John Panelli, 200 pounds of full-
back, will run with Livingstone
and Terry Brennan in the back-
ﬁeld. All three have the exper-
ience to give them a lot of savvy
and advantage over Pitt.

Sixteenth In
Long Series a

By Donald Giffin
“Opening against Pitt on Oc-
tober 4, they should win in a

breeze . . .,” states Jack Sher in

writing of Notre Dame for a
sport’s monthly. I

Had Sher been writing football
in.the 30’s, he would never have

dared make such a statement. In —

those years, the Irish of South

Bent were just another strong op-
ponent on the schedule of Dr.

John B. (Jock) Sutherland’s great,

Pitt elevens.

Five times Sutherland-coached
teams whipped Notre Dame dur-
ing’ the eight-game series from
1930 through 1937.'With Marshall
“Biggie” Goldberg shooting into
the limelght that brought him All-
American honors and a place
among all-time Pitt gridiron
greats, the 1936 Jungle Cats tram-
pled the Irish, 26-O.

Irish Hold Advantage

This glorious victory stands as
the most clear—cut Pitt triumph
over Notre Dame in the thrice-
interrupted pigskin relations that
were inaugurated in 1909. How-
ever, the Golden-Domed unver-
sity owns the record book advan-
tage over the Panthers, nine wins
to ﬁve. They fought to a scoreless
tie in 1910. ‘ 

Last Fall, Wes ‘Fesler fared no
better. He devised a 5-4-2 defense
to stop Notre Dame’s crushing
ground game, only to have John-
ny Lujak heave two touchdown
passes and set up two other scores
via the air. In 60 minutes, the
Ramblers had scored 33 points
while blanking the Panthers.

‘Dream Backﬁeld’ Wins, 21-6

In 1937, the year of the famous
“Dream Backﬁeld,” Pitt slammed
Notre Dame, 21-6. Frank Patrick,
the offensive gun of this particu-
lar fray, uttered a remark that
his teammates still rehash now
and then.

First, the situation. Pitt on the
Irish 24. Fourth down, two yards
to go. Patrick was nominated for
the plunge, and was asked, “Do
you think you can make two
yards, Frank?” -

“I’ll try,” he answered.

On the snapback, Patrick roar- ~

ed through the heart of the Notre
Dame line for 22 yards and a
touchdown. A

Surrounded by his mates, who
were pounding him on the back,
Frank asserted, “I got the two
yards. There was nobody ‘there,
so I just kept on going.” .

Saturday, the Panthers hope to
show Pittsburghers that a Suther-
land-trained coaching staff can
reproduce elevens similar to those
of the brilliant Scotch doctor. ‘ '

At Sport Chief

“Upsets are my meat!” boasted
. Sports Editor John Golightly last
‘ week, as he produced a prediction
 sheet, splattered with underdog
choices.’

We football scribes smiled dour-
ly over our elbows as we applied
salve to the lash. marks on our
backs. We were not very gay.

This week we are joyous. When
the Saturday results rolled in, our
merriment knew no bounds. Go-
lightly had “seered” home only 4
winners in 12 heats for a sterling
. percentage of .333.

Editor Has Ulcers

Our sports editor was bedfast
early this week, suffering from an
UPSET stomach. He thinks he is
acquiring gastric ulcers from his
excessive crow-eating.

Joe Santone ‘ and Doc Giﬂin,
, _sticking close to the favorites,
9  lead the ﬁeld of News prognosti-
cators with results of 10 right,
1 two wrong, and average of .833.

Chugging along behind the lead-
ers is Myron Kopelman, who
picked 9. of the 12 games correct-
ly -— his percentage, .750. Below
“Kope” in the standings, but far,
far above “the.mad man of the
eighth ﬁoor” perches Max Scherb,
whose choices came through eight
times ' out of twelve, averaging
.666.

' Sing Illini Ahﬁa. Mater

After a consultation, that was
shrouded in mystery, our sports
chief emerged, vowing to make us
f forget the fatal day, September
‘ .27. I

The fact that Golightly and
Copy Editor Don Mccormack are
buddies and roamed around the
News oﬁice Monday singing the
Illini alma mater did not deter
Mccormack from ridiculing our
choices.

Muttering that he can do bet-
ter, Mac made his selections of
this Saturday’s games. We refused
 to print his choices, feeling sure
u ’ that he was only trying to get
I his name in the paper, somewhere
other than in the mast head.

_ , , Incidentally, the sports staff re-
serves the, right to “ride”. our boss.

There may be a story behind Pitt’s 14-0 loss to Illinois,
but it ‘will have to wait until later in the season.
Those of us who thought Pitt might upset the Illini

last season. This year’s Illini

eleven is far superior to the eventual Rose‘ Bowl winner that

They don ’t have a backﬁeld threat comparable to Buddy
Young, but they do have a balanced backﬁeld which is loaded
with power. It didn’t make any difference whether Steger, Pat-
terson, Dufelmeier, or Eddleman carried the ball.

same——yardage on the credit side.
Offensively, the Illini guards were
terriﬁc. Quarterback Perry Moss
was permitted plenty of time for
shoveling laterals to either side
of the line.
Illini Line Tough

Ray Eliot maintained a steady
stream of linemen between the
bench and the playing ﬁeld with-
out any visible loss in eﬁiciency.
Thellinois line is experienced and
tough. , I

Perhaps the radio broadcast
misled Pitt listeners for the con-
sensus around campus condemns
the _Illini to _the “they aren’t so
hot” class. Make no mistake about
it. Ray._Eliot’s young men were in
complete command throughout.

The tip-off on this lies in the
statistics. In the‘ encounter last
season, Pitt ‘gained 205 yards rush-
ing and passing   
to Illinois’ 226 
yards. It was a _,
much different
story last Sat-

Ilinois’ fumbles actually point
out another factor in their favor.
They spent most of the ﬁrst half
driving toward the Pitt goal, and
four times they fumbled en route.
A less experienced or a less con-
ﬁdent team might_ have become

they kept plugging away, and ﬁ-
