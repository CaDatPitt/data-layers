Excessive amounts of hydrogen sulfide
in the air cause respiratory and eye irritation

eggs, according to Virostek. ~ .

LTV Steel is currently in the process of
implementing a $75 million renovation
project, which includes the installation of
an improved gas—reheating system for the

Kavulich from LTV Steel. ~

LTV officials said the new system will

Several coke plants in the Pittsburgh
area have violated state air-pollution
regulations, according to the Allegheny
County Health Department.

“Clairton and LTV [Steel] are in constant
violation of air-pollution regulations,” said
Walter Goldburg, a Pitt professor and
member of the Group Against Smog and
Pollution’s Board of Directors. “They pay
the fines or a tiny fraction of them, and
then they accumulate more violations.”

Coke is a fuel produced by heating soft
coal.

USX’s Clairton Works and LTV Steel’s
Hazelwood plant are fined every three
months by the Allegheny County Health
Department for air-pollution violations,
according to the health department. In the
fourth quarter of 1990, LTV Steel was ﬁned
$17,100,~and Clairton was fined $13,200.
‘ “LTV Steel has had problems with their
desulfurization units, which has caused
excessive release of hydrogen sulﬁdes,”

Activist blasts Obie waste incinerator

See Brutus, page 4

By Gary Knapick

‘ For The Pitt News

“They're going ahead and
telling the public that it’s perfectly
safe, that they've done everything
in a most stringent way. Well,
that's a bloody lie!” said Paul
Connett, who spoke yesterday
against the Waste Technology
Industries toxic-waste incinerator,
nearing completion in East
Liverpool, Ohio. The incinerator
is 37 miles from Pittsburgh.

' Connett, a professor of
chemistry at St. Lawrence
University, called the incinerator
“an affront to human decency
and common sense.”

It has been at the center of a
12-year clash among scientists,
lawyers, citizens and the
government.

“Anybody with a shred of
decency would reject this
facility based on a few sentences.
This facility is going to be built

on the banks of the Ohio River.

There are going to be people
living within a few hundred feet
of that facility. There will be an
elementary school above the

height of the facility 1,100 feet’

away. It defies human decency
and common sense to put such a

potentially dangerous facility so‘

close to human beings.

“If any kind of __mechanical
failure, electronic failure or human
failure occurs in the next 20 years
of operation, people are going to
be damaged. The officials behind
this, both in the corripany and in
the agencies, are opening
themselves up for a massive
lawsuit when the first injury takes
place,” Connettsaid.

After offering audience
members both scientific data and
case histories of other incinerators
in the United States and Europe,
Connett attacked the “arrogance”
and “lousy science” involved in

bringing W‘I'I’s ‘facility to East

Liverpool.

Ohio Gov. George Voinovich
was among the many officials
Connett condemned for allowing
WTI’s permit, issued in 1979, to
stand even though new
regulations would have prevented
the selection of the East Liverpool
site. _

“If we’re going to give a person
that much power, they’d damn
well better have responsibilities,”
Connett said.

Connett was especially
frustrated by the inaction of both

the federal and Ohio
Environmental Protection
Agencies.

“The public thinks that the
EPA is protecting their health and
their environment. In actuality,
they have the power to permit 
but not the power to protect,”
Connett said. 

. A cheer rose from the audience
as Connett proclaimed, “We have ,

Black Action Society’s Indaba stresses black unity

By Gena McCarthy
For The Pitt News

Black unity, respect and involvement
On campus highlighted educator Clifford
Sykes’ discussion at the Black Action
SOciety’s Indaba, held in a packed William
Pitt Union Ballroom Friday night.

The word “indaba” is a Zulu term
meaning a coming together Of the people,
an important meeting Or discussion that
features a storyteller.

The African heritage Of the term was
emphasized by the traditional setup Of the
room. Chairs fanned Out in a series Of
circles from the podium, which created
opportunities for interaction with the
speaker. The first Indaba was held by the

BAS in 1970.

The Indaba began the semester for the
BAS, providing an Opportunity for new
students and non-members to mingle with
BAS members and learn about the
Organization.

“Unity before progress” was the central
theme Of Sykes’ presentation. Sykes is a
former public—school teacher and is a
Ph.D. candidate in the music department
at Pitt. '

“You have to blaze a path in student
government, the paper Or anything that
interests you,” Sykes said. .

This message was also emphasized by
BAS Chairperson Marta Effinger. “We each
must make a commitment to [work] for
black Organizations,” Efﬁnger said. “We

can move one step further towards
improving things for the African-American
community.”

People who don’t participate have no
right to criticize, Efftnger said.

Before" involvement is possible, there
must be mutual respect, Sykes said.
According to Sykes, African-Americans
who think that “black folks can’t get it
together” contribute to lower graduation
rates. A
African—Americans make up roughly 8
percent Of Pitt’s student body, about 2,000
students. Only one-third Of this percentage
will graduate.

Sykes, who is also chairperson Of the
black re—education committee at Pitt, asked
his audience, “Who is going to teach your

children?"

Sykes once taught in Michigan and cited
evidence for the need for more black
involvement in education. The figures,
taken from the Michigan State Board Of
Education, state that Out Of 7,000
elementary school teachers in the state,
ﬁve are black males under the age Of 50.

As a final message to the black
community, Sykes quoted an African
proverb, saying, “Bloom where you are
planted. Get involved; make a difference.”

BAS officers were also introduced to the
audience on Friday, as well as
representatives Of other organizations such
as black sororities and fraternities. ,

The Indaba was followed by a kick-Off
social in the Union.

Use Of ‘ozbortionr pill ’ stalled I9ypO_Zz'z‘z'cozZ controversy

By Kirsta H. Bleyle
For The Pitt News

In 1982 Dr. Gary Hodgen
brought the first package OfRU486
to the United States, never
anticipating the controversy
surrounding this drug, often
referred to as “the abortion pill.”

Hodgen, president OfTheJOnes
Institute for Reproductive
Medicine at Eastern Virginia
Medical School, spoke at the
Graduate School Of Public Health
Thursday about “The Politics Of
RU486.” _

RU486 is a progesterone
antagonist which has been used
in France during the past decade

for the termination of
approximately 100,000 '
pregnancies.

But studies .._have shown the
drug to have many other uses,
ranging from treatment for
endometriosis to increasing milk
production for nursing mothers.

“Political impact has reached
levels Of research, even when
abortion isn’t the research issue,”
Hodgen told an audience Of about
150 graduate and doctoral
students.

“I don’t want to come here to

 

9

‘.5

get you to support a line Of
political action I'm On,” Hodgen
said.

Even though RU486 has been
shown to have uses other than
that of an “abortion pill,” anti-
abortion issues are preventing
the possibility Of approval by the
Food and Drug Administration.
Without approval from the FDA,
a drug cannot be dispensed to
patients.

Although Hodgen’s research
encompasses the many uses Of

_RU-486, he said the drug should

be approved in the United States
for abortion use.

Of the 100,000 women in France
who used the drug for purposes
Of abortion, only one known
death has occurred, . and two

women needed blood
transfusions due to hemorrhaging,
Hodgen said.

These statistics for RU486 are
more encouraging than those for
more conventional abortion
methods, such as “vacuuming,”
according to Hodgen.

“It is so important that this not
be seen as ‘take two aspirin and
call me in the mOrning,’” Hodgen
said.

In France check-ups are
mandatory for patients after
treatment.

The drug is ‘said to be 96-
percent effective if administered
before six weeks have elapsed in
the pregnancy.

Hodgen said a woman should
be able to choose to terminate a

pregnancy, especially if the
pregnancy is life—threatening.

“I have a problem thinking that
a woman has equal value to a

,pre_—embryO, ” he said, adding that

one day someone spray—painted
“BABY KILLER”- On his ‘car.
When one member Of the
audience asked what people
should do to help further the
advancement Of the approval Of
RU486, Hodgen said it would
depend On what decisions
political leaders will make and
how they view the abortion issue.

He also commented On the‘
upcoming elections. “The biology 1

and medicine Of RU486 has
dropped by the wayside,” /he

said, adding that people would I

view the drug differently if its
initial use had not been for
abortion.

He said he is concerned that no .
matter how much research is’

done, politics will determine if
RU486 reaches its full potential,

not just as an “abortion pill” but .

as a drug available for other uses

THE prrr NEWS, Monday, September 9, 1991

 

Continued from page 1
Africa’s primary black political
party, has rejected the proposal,
and Brutus agrees with this move.

“[By doing this] you will dilute

the black vote. [Blacks] represent
80 percent of the population, but
not 80 percent of the vote. The
government is not serious about
the proposition.
' They just want to run it up the
ﬂagpole andsee who salutes it.
The apartheid government has a
double agenda: to pretend to
create a democracy while at the
same time keeping the power in
the hands of a minority,” Brutus
said. ‘ » ' '

According to Brutus, living
conditions have not improved
for the South African blacks

_ either.

“There once was a law that

created ghettos. Blacks could not

live in towns They had to live
outside the towns in shanties.

They eliminated thelaw but not -

the ghettos.
“The ghettos have multiplied

_by roughly 100 times. I saw on

one occasion 100,000 shacks. I
could see from a plane an entire
area of shanties and shacks. What
I’m saying is that for many blacks
conditions have become worse,”
Brutus said.

Brutus said he sees the same
conditions in the United States.

“I think that conditions [for
blacks in the United States] are
pretty shameful, and they are
getting worse for blacks in terms
of joblessness, homelessness,
child-care  I think conditions
are pretty disgraceful,” Brutus
said.

Brutus was ordered to leave
South Africa in 1966, when he
was released from prison on
Robbin Island, a South African
prison which many dissenters call
home. -

He had to sign an agreement
saying that he would not return
to South Africa under penalty of
imprisonment.

During his imprisonment he
hammered stones with Nelson
Mandela. Brutus escaped twice
and once wasshot in the back

trying to escape.

Brutus was not permitted to
write poetry before he was
exiled because his writing
related to his experiences as a
black youth oppressed by
apartheid.

But on his return, he was
allowed to read poetry, teach
and talk to students.

He spoke at four universities,
lectured at two major conferences
and six creative-writing
workshops.

Though he was allowed to visit
his homeland for several weeks,
Brutus has still not been granted
South African citizenship.

He is a resident alien in the
United States living under asylum
and has not applied for American
citizenship. A

“I have a right to be a South
African citizen. Why would I want
to be a citizen of any other
country?” Brutus said.

Brutus is presently on sabbatical
but will resume teaching classes

at the University of Pittsburgh in

August 1992.

Garrett refused comment.

Lewis said he recruited writers
from College Republicans,
Students for Life and the Panther
Pistol and Rifle Club.

Lewis also sought financial
support from the Student
Government Board allocations
committee.

' According to Lewis, SGB
allocations agreed to pay for
the’ prihting of 2,000 copies of
the first issue, but Progressive

Edge never received any
funding.Because the paper was
never published, the money
was never actually used.-

The staff of about 20 university
students decided on the title
Progressive Edge based on its
interpretation of the word
“progressive.”

According to Lewis, the
Progressive Edge staff defined
“progressive” as “the

“Since conservative ideals‘ are

“The civil complaint charges

Clean Air Act and the

Pennsylvania SIP by using
contaminated water to cool hot
coke produced at the Clairton
coke oven batteries and by
releasingraw coke-oven gas from
those batteries,” the EPA stated
in a news release on February 25.

Although the case was initiated
in February, USX and the EPA are
still 'in the early stages of
negotiations, according to Joan
Goodis of the EPA.

“Everyone would like to keep it
out of court, ” Goodis said. “[USXl

recommendations.”

Clairton vented raw coke-oven

liars in our government agencies!”

Much of the speech was devoted to
exposing WTI’s allegedlylackadaisical risk
assessment. “[WTI’s health—risk assessment]
is a self-fulfilling prophecy, pseudo-
scientific rationalization for a political
decision that’s already been made.“

The University of Pittsburgh’s Center for
Hazardous Materials Research is studying
the effects of the incinerator. Connett said
CHMR and WTI officials were invited to
send representatives but did not.

“If you ask a mathematician what two
plus two is, he’ll say ‘Four.’ If you ask a
philosopher, he’ll say, ‘That depends what
you mean by two and by plus.’ If you ask
a consultant, he’ll close the door and
ask you what you want it to be,” Connett
said.

Connett produced a letter written by a
lawyer asking a consulting ﬁrm to lower
its estimates of certain emissions.

Connett accused WTI of neglecting risk-
evaluation studies on the bio-accumulation
of methyl mercury and other stack
emissions in the food chain.

Referring to an article in the March 9,-

1991 issue of Science News, Connett said,
“The amount of mercury needed to
contaminate a 25-acre lake is about a third
of a gram per year. This facility couldbe
putting out over a million grams of mercury
each year. ‘

“Very bright people have missed the
point because they asked the wrong
question. The question they asked about
mercury is, ‘What level of mercury are
people going to breathe, and what were
the levels in industry that have caused
problems?’ If you ask the question that
way, then the levels of mercury [from the
incinerator] are safe. The real dangers of

mercury bio-accumulation are in the lakes,
streams, and wetlands.” -

Connett pointed to the potential hazards
of dioxin emissions from such incinerators.
“The intake of one liter of milk from a cow
that breathes these dioxins is equivalent to
breathing the same dioxins for eight
months."

Perhaps even more alarming are the
dioxins’ possible effects on human beings,
he said.

“The level of dioxins in a mother’s
breast milk in Germany means that an
infant gets 100 times its allowable dioxin
intake during the first year of life. We now
have German pediatricians telling mothers
to limit their breast feeding to three or four
months. As one doctor said to me in
Germany, ‘When you tell mothers to limit
their breast feeding, you’re looking.at the
beginning of the end of mankind,’” Connett
said.

Following a brief chemistry lesson,
Connett described the dangers of other
typical incinerator emissions, including
2,3,7,8Tetrachlorinate Dibenzodioxin, one
of the most toxic substances ever created
by man.

The same carcinogen was found at Love
Canal, New ‘York, and in the Vietnam—era
defoliant Agent Orange.

The economic implications of such
incinerators could be devastating to the
food industry, according to Connett.
“Purdue Chicken announced  that they
would not purchase chicken from
Northampton County, N.C., if a hazardous-
waste incinerator was built there  There
were 14 food—processsing companies who
opposed the [location] of a hazardous-'
waste incinerator in Trafford, a city in the
United Kingdom."

Connett, who said he has helped
communities in 44 states and four Canadian
provinces, does not like to be called an
expert.

“Experts are the guys that industry hires
to convince people that their common

sense is wrong.”

Connett said, “I _don’t believe in ‘

commercial hazardous—waste incineration.
Even in a desert, I would be opposed to
it.”

“[\X/aste incineration companies] simply

poor, too preoccupied and too powerless

A memorial service honoring

Nathaniel Savage, a brother of A

Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, and
Eric Ulmer of Phi Kappa Theta
was held Thursday in Heinz
Chapel.

Savage and Ulmer were killed
in late August in a motorcycle
accident.

Peter Goenyou, a member of
Phi Kappa Theta, said, “It was
good to see so many people
here from both the fraternities
and sororities, even people they

worked with."

Dave Cavenaugh, Savage’s
roommate, stressed Savage’s
involvement in the Greek system
and what an outgoing, happy
person he was.

~ “Nate was confident, friendly
and almost always loud.
Whenever he opened his mouth,
he made a friend,” Cavenaugh
said.

Brian Lipinski, Ulmer’s best
friend, spoke on behalf of Phi
Kappa Theta.

Lipinski encouraged friends
and family not to dwell on
Ulmer’s death.

“I’m sure they want us to get
on with life, to let those bad
feelings subside  I know Eric
died a happy young man,”
Lipinski said.

Phi Gamma Delta President
Doug Doerﬂer said the service
brought the two fraternity houses
closer together.

“[Savage and Ulmer] were both
a really big part of the Greek
system. They had so many

V friends,” he said.

Doerﬂer thanked Cavenaugh,
who coordinated the memorial,
and said Cavenaugh did an
excellent job of remembering

Savage.

Bernie Etters, former president
of Phi Kappa Theta, summed up
the opinions of many attending
the service.

“On behalf of the fraternities,
I'd like to thank everyone for all
the support that helped make
such a hard time a little easier,"
Etters said. ’

Sam Johnson, who helped
organize the memorial, was also
pleased" to see the turnout. “I
was especially pleased that both
of their parents were able to
come.”

The service began with

Don’t accuse Trudy Palmer of
being inactive. .‘‘I enjoy theater,
certain athletics, needlepoint,
baking, jazz and I’d like to do
some publishing one day,” she
said.

An assistant professor of English
and a faculty member of the
black studies department, Palmer
is currently teaching Basic
Reading and Writing and a senior
seminar, while she has offered
courses on American Literary
Tradition and Black Literature in
the past.’

Also a member of the
Affirmative Action Committee,
Palmer is quick to clear up any
misconceptions about the
program. “It does, to some extent,
relate to recruitment of students
and faculty, but primarily it
ensures that minority students’
needs within the department are
being met in terms of the
Curriculum.”

A nativeof Chicago, Palmer
did her graduate work at Stanford
University, focusing her studies
on English and American literature
and completing her dissertation
on black literature.

terrace of the Towers facing the
Schenley Quad at approximately
1:30 a.m'.' Saturday.

Paramedics from Presbyterian
University Hospital’s trauma unit
arrived at the scene at 1:37 a.m.
Boxley, who landed headﬁrst, is
listed in critical condition in the
intensive—care unit, according to
campus police.

According to campus police _ ' l ‘

reports, a witness described
Boxley as intoxicated before the
incident to the point where Boxley
“could hardly stand up.”
Campus police are still
conducting an investigation.

James Baldwin among her favorite
authors, while she admits to
having grown fond of William
Faulkner.

She is also politically active
and was a member of the Faculty
and Staff for Peace in the Middle
East during the Gulf war. “We
held some mealtime, brown—bag
discussions and organized a

teach—in which was very

successful.”

But Palmer said former Pitt
President Wesley Posvar refused
to cancel classes on the day of the
teach-in, which made it‘ very
difficult for the teachers to find
space and garner support for the
activities, which were planned to
run from noon until 10 p.m.

Despite the problems, she said,
the events went on as schedule;
guest speakers discussed U.S.
relations and foreign policy in
the Middle East. Workshops were
held on topics such as “race in
the war” and “media in the war.”

“I think it was a phenomenally
good, solid, engaging and varied
program," Palmersaid, “especially
considering the short amount of
time we had to organize the
effort.”

Despite her strong political
views, Palmer does not like being
defined as a liberal.

  Double impact ,  

Described as a “high-profile, menacing bunch that look

and act like they mean business,” the latest division of the

_ Pittsburgh Police Department is cracking down on drugs
"in the Pittsburgharea. A -

A The Impact Squad arrested 36 people on drug charges

during its first 48 hours on the streets. Some City Council

_ members are ‘impressed with the efforts. Following the

sweeps, City ‘ Council Member’ Duane Darkins said,

   

“Homewood is quiet. I’m very pleased.” Other members, ’

however, do not agree. .
City Councilman Jim Ferlo referred to the sweeps as

“hype” and also suggested that civil liberties were being A

violated.

The crackdown may increase drug arrests, and it may

also keep some dealers off the streets, but the procedures
fused to capture these “criminals” are more than
questionable.

In one instance, two teenagers driving a “Blazer with a
fancy paint job” were pulled over, and the driver was
accosted by a detective for being too slow in placing both
of his hands on the truck. A search of the car by drug-
hunting dogs turned up nothing but an expensive-sound
system. "

As the Impact Squad cruises the area, they are looking
for “suspected drug users, dug dealers, their customers
and anyone else looking remotely suspicious.” Police
have historically inferred this to mean black males.

The practice of naming certain areas “hot spots” only

" adds to the confusion. Homewood has been the focus of
several articles regarding this situation. Is it any coincidence
that Homewood’s population is predominantly black?

According to Ferlo, there is no coincidence. He questions
whether or not the blacks have been unfairly targeted by

 

. narcotics officers and adds, “Anyone who thinks we’re

 “ - going to deal. with the drug problem by- chasing a few
j teenagers  let’s be real. And how many white teenager
were cha‘séd?’Zero.” ‘

According to The Pittsburgh Press, the Impact Squad
“clad entirely in black: _black T -shirts with‘._,"Pittsbufrg

'_ A Police’ a‘nd"Pittsburgh Narcotics’ emblazoned in yellow

on front and back, black military fatigue pants, black

. baseball hats, black shoes or boots.” The detectives have

- been transferred from several of the police departments,

if including burglary, auto and sex-assault squads. The

validity of these switches is not yet apparent, since most

of the arrests have not turned up any hard-core drug
dealers.

If in fact the Impact Squad is “making a difference,” it
will be a minute one. Says Detective Doug Johnson, “The
main players are in hiding". T hey’re waiting until this
crackdown is overt.”

 The point, then, of this crackdown is eliminated.

_ Decreasing drug use and sales in any area must start at the
top — with the dealers, not the users. ‘With, as Johnson
says, dealers in hiding (i.e. everyone knows where they
are except the police), the money and time spent on this
crackdown is a waste.

Soviet empire collapses after coup

Just when you think you have seen it all, the
world turns around and spits borsch in your eye.
The events in Moscow surrounding the failed coup
have given the world a nervous reminder that

nothing can be assumed, and nothing is impossible. '

In the last ﬁve years the world has rejoiced as the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe opened up to
democracy and freedom. Then in one day all that
good will evaporated as the Soviet coup removed
Gorbachev in a manner eerily

individual republics can survive on their own, nor
is it clear exactly how the separations are going to
be worked out and what will be done with the old
USSR holdihgs, which includes a nuclear arsenal.
All of this brings a great amount of confusion and
uncertainty to dealing diplomatically and
economically with the ’ Soviet Union and the
republics. '

If there were one good thing that could be said
about the old USSR, it would be

reminiscent of the way that
Khrushchev was removed in 1964.
Fears of a new cold war rose as -it
seemed that glasnost was over.
!«rmages of gulags and overstuffed

‘   Mark”
Carlin

that it brought stability to the
‘historically volatile regions of
central and eastern Europe. Now
that the iron curtain has fallen,
we are witness to a disturbing

‘through many people’s thoughts.

But before anyone could get into a serious state
of despair, the coup imploded, and Gorbachev
returned. The hardliners were defeated, and the
Communist Party was routed. Boris Yeltsin’s staunch
defense of the Russian Parliament and democracy
has made him an almost unstoppable political
force for reform and freedom. So now the Soviet
Union is on the way to peace, justice and eternal
joy, right3_\X/ellllllllll, maybe not.

Most people are delighted to see reform and
genuine civil liberties come to the old evil empire.
But that is not all that is happening to the Soviet
Union. Since the end of the coup the whole
countryhas started to come apart. The Communist
Party, which has been the ruling force for the last
70 years, is rapidly being cannibalized. The once-
indomitable party will soon be no more as all its
offices are forcibly closed and its land is forfeited.
This may seem like good news, but it leaves the
country without any established political structures
to guide it through this crucial period of transition.

The Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia have left the Soviet Union and become
independent nations. Many of the remaining Soviet
republics, including Moldavia, Georgia and the
Ukraine, have started the process of leaving the
union. These are some of the most important and
bountiful regions in the USSR, and the ability of the
remaining Soviet nation to survive economically is
questionable. Also, no one knows how well the

‘rise in nationalist violence.
Yugoslavia is facing brutality as
ethnic clashes between Croats, Serbs and Slavs
escalate, while each group tries to carve out its own
nation and identity. This did not happen when the
bad boys ran the Soviet Union.

The former Soviet empire housed hundreds of
ethnic minorities, many of whom have not been on
the friendliest of terms. The Lithuanians, Latvians,
Ukrainians and Estonians, to name a few, have all
resented the presence of the minority" Russians in
their land. If the union continues to dissolve, the
safety of those minority Russians could be seriously
threatened. The Armenians and the Azerbaijanis
have a blood feud dating back centuries which is
currently aggravated by each group’s disputed
claim to Nagorno—Karabakh. Without some Soviet
control, there is an excellent chance that a lot of
blood could be ﬂowing throughout the former-
Soviet empire very soon.

This is not to suggest that the collapse of the old
Soviet empire is not a great turning point in world
history. Howeverbefore we get too busy celebrating

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday, September 9, 1991

 

Avoiding
“I eat, therefore I gain” — Raff,
1991.

The so-called “Freshman 15"
is, boys and girls, a reality. I don’t
know any student who lived on
campus their first year who didn’t
gain weight. In factl made some
very good friends doing so,
myself. The hotpot. The
microwave. The aisles at Giant
Eagle. And of course, the MAC
machine.

People who know me are going
to say I’m a hypocrite for writing
about all of these handy-dandy
ways not to gain, considering I,
too, gained a substantial amount
of weight during my first yearat
Pitt. “O” pizza. Ramen noodles.
Macaroni and cheese in a hotpot.
Beer. Chocolate bars. Late at night,
Before breakfast. Between class.
We eat, and we gain. No matter
how conscious you were of your
weight before you. came to
college, there is no doubt your
weight will escalate at least a few
pounds. (Unless, of course, you’re
one of those people with an
inhuman metabolism. You can
stop reading now.)

,It was last November when I
realized I had gained six pounds
in a little over two months. I got
paranoid. I stopped eating, and I
tried to find a place where I
could work out. _ -

The first thing I learned is that
Trees Hall certainly does not
accommodate the number of
students at Pitt. Besides the hours
are so erratic it’s nearly impossible
to fit them into your schedule.
For example the pool is open
from 11:30-1:30 and then from
3:30 until 9. The weight room is
open the same hours, Monday
through Friday. Sorry, my
schedule doesn’t accomodate
that.

So then I went to Forbes Fitness
to purchase a membership. Why?
Because it’s the closest place
around, just a few blocks from
the Towers. A full—year

‘membership (which is frozen for
the four months most students
return home for the summer)
generally costs $320 if paid in
full. Otherwise students can make
two payments of $173 each or

‘ pay $79 down and $30 a month

for 12 months. Forbes Fitness

Lisa Raff

offers Nautilus machines,
freeweights, LifeCycles and
Stairmasters, and a specific
program analysis complete with
supervision is included in the
membership. _

But let’s assume that for some
reason, you just don’t like Forbes
Fitness. There are some
alternatives.

There’s the City Club
Downtown, which requires a
year’s commitment, but
membership fees are collected
each month. The City Club offers
indoor pools and basketball
courts, Stairmasters and Lifecycles,
Nordic Skiing machines and
Aerobic classes; the list goes on
and on. But there are some
drawbacks.

Your membership is
approximately $60 a month. BUT
WAIT! Don’t take out Y()ur
calculators yet! I’ve already done
that for you; the approximate
total is $720! BUT WAIT! It gets
worse! You also have to purchase

, a Zone 1 bus pass for all of those

trips you’ll be making Downtown
(those now go for $40 a month),

and don’t forget you’re going to
have to buy eight of those puppies '

(one for each month you’re in
school), which brings us to a
grand total of $1,040 a year.

Okay, so maybe that isn't such
an alternaritive. Sue me.

There are other health clubs
available in Shadyside and
Squirrel Hill, too. But unless you
have a car at Pitt (which most

students don’t), your best and.

most economical way to prevent
weight gain is simply... control.

Control? What’s that, you ask?
Read on! ,

As a first-year student, you are
forced by the university to
purchase a 14- or 19-meal plan
for the Towers and Lothrop
cafeterias. Dinner is served from
four to six p.m. (last I checked),
which are pretty illogical hours
considering your average first-
year student doesn’t get to sleep
until at least 2 a.m. everynight.

And what is there to do between
the time the cafeterias close and
bedtime? Well, you can study 

the freshman ﬁfteen

but let’s be realistic.

You get together with the
people on your ﬂoor. You talk;
you smoke some cigarettes;
maybe do a little bit of drinking,
and then, the inevitable:,You eat.
Whether it’s at the “O” or TCBY
or your very own dorm room,
you eat. You’re not the only one.

But what can you do about it?
(Here's where the control thing
comes in!!)

1. Do not, I repeat, do not, eat
at the “O” on a regular basis.
Okay, the $2.99 pizza deal is
enticing, but it’s also a trap. When
I lived in the Towers, the people
on my ﬂoor would pitch in and
get at least three pizzas per night.
After a while I began to think the
“O” had cut a deal with the
university by making the Towers
bedrooms look like pizza slices,
just so that we were constantly
reminded that pizza was just a
few steps away.

2. The next time you go food
shopping at Giant Eagle, be sure
to grab a few pieces of fruit or
even some veggies (You can boil
these easily in a hotpot.) Sure,
Doritos and chocolate bars taste
good, but they don’t really fill
you up or give you any nutrients.

3. 7-Eleven is not your best
friend. Yeah, it’s one of the only
places in Oakland where you can
take ﬁve bucks out of the MAC
machines, and that may be
convenient, .but the candy aisle is
so elaborate you can end up
being indecisive and purchasing
three or four candy bars just
‘cause you can’t make up you
mind.

My best advice to all is that you I
try to keep your weight under '

control. Go running every now
and then. Walk to Shadyside on
a Saturday to work off the
previous night’s binges. If you

find that you’re gaining weight, A

don’t binge becuase of the
depression.

Most importantly, don’t purge.
It’s not healthy, and health is
what we’re talking about here!

So remember: You can eat, just
don’t let it get out of control.

Abortion unjustified

a solution to pregnancy

My conscience does not allow me to ignore the mufﬂed cries
of the 1.6 million innocents slaughtered yearly in this country.
Are your ears not as sensitive, or is it a lacking much deeper than
that?

One of the latest laws prevents programs funded by the
federal government to discuss or, more importantly, suggest
abortion as the most viable option to pregnancy. Patients
should have knowledge‘ on the full range of options. But what
about the consequences of abortion? How many women have

Joe Babinsack

complete information about the-long-term risks of an operation
that has a history under two decades?

The abortion activists want the freedom to speak their own
speech about abortion. Fetus, embryo and fertilized egg are all

relatively meaningless terms to someone with no more than an .1

elementary education The argument is whether or not a child
in the womb is a distinct being; for if it is, then abortion is
murder. These terrninators are the ones dictating control
through the hiding of the whole truth. Young doctors have the
most information about the whole procedure, and they are
showing less interest in taking up the lucrative specialty.

Just what is the reasoning behind abortion? Lewis Lehrman
claims it to be “a spurious right born exclusively of judicial
supremacy, with not a single trace of lawful authority, implicit
or explicit, in the actual text of history or the constitution itself.”

The constitution is set up to provide for all Americans both
life and liberty. Lehrman logically states that “all persons cannot
be endowed both with the liberty to take innocent life by
abortion and with the inalienable right to live.” How can
supporters of abortion allow the destruction of a being seven
months into pregnancy and not allow it in the case of a
premature infant the same age? Neither can survive without the
mother or tremendous medical care.

We see some wealthy feminists defending fanatically their so-
called rights by taking up the cause of the poor. These few
middle-sand upper- class women are speaking for the poor yet
assuming to speak for all women, for the nature of poverty for
ages suggests that the more people in the family, the more
money that family can earn. How can the poorjustify terminating

another potential source of income and spending hundreds of ‘

dollars doing so? It’s yet another liberal attempt to champion
the cause of the poor by deluding them with a costly, unwanted
solution to a symptom. Teach the poor to escape poverty, and"
I'll gladly pay the bill. Tell them to kill their children with my
money, and I’ll stubbornly refuse to be an accomplice to

. murder.

Why is abortion wrong? We all know the religious reasoning.
Another angle on the innate fallacy of abortion is a Darwinist}
one. To the evolutionary, only the strong can and will survive.
This is the driving theory behind the growth and strengthening
of any species. It is not in the best interest of humanity to take '
away the unpredictability of potential. Imposition_of the desired
order of the wealthy, subversive elitists upon the masses is the
surest form of genocide.

Bush buddies blow big bucks by bustling on Beltway

Boy, does George Bush know how to
pick nominees. First, he chooses John “My
Last Name Is a Palindrome” Sununu as his
chief of staff, who we later discover has
spent the last two—and-a-half years
siphoning all the fuel from Air Force One
to go on his vacations.

Now he’s having the same trouble with
Clarence Thomas, the latest Supreme Court
nominee. It seems that Thomas is in
trouble for taking quite a few unauthorized
trips courtesy of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, according to
the Pittsburgh Press.

Where was he going on all of these trips,
you ask? Why, the usual places government
officials go when they have a free weekend
and a Learjet with a full tank — Savannah,
Ga. .

I know that it’s irritating to ﬁnd out that
our public officials are making all kinds of
insane trips at taxpayers’ expense, but I'm
sure he had a good reason. The word is
(according to the Press) that he made
speeches criticizing Congress and praising
the virtues of Oliver North. .

Adam
Richter

Thomas didn’t only travel to Savannah,
though. He also made 13 trips to St. Louis
while he headed the EEOC, seven trips to
Tahiti while he was the head of RCA, and
one two-week stay at Club Med during his
tenure as CEO of Chrysler.

True, I made up those last two. But if
you were the head of a major record label
and an auto company, wouldn't you take
vacations like that? (That's whatl thought.)

I suppose the big question here is:
What the heck is Bush doing nominating
people who could very well take the
presidential limo without asking, ‘drive to
Mexico City and not return until having
exhausted .a full tank of gas and several
bottles of tequila?

Actually, there are a lot of differences
between Sununuand Thomas. First of all,
take their names. If you mix up theletters

in Sununu’.s name, you get ‘sunny side,

up.” While with Thomas, the only anagram
possible is “I am the walrus.”

Second, when Sununu went on
ridiculous trips and spent outrageous
amounts of tax money, he made sure the

,vacation was worth it. He vacationed in

spots like Verrriont, populated by people
who think that the Volvo is the national
car.

1 Thomas‘, on the other hand, visited
places like Georgia, which is populated
by people still waiting to hear whether or
not Lee repelled the Yankee forces at

‘ Gettysburg.

Naturally, as with all Supreme Court
nominees (especially the ones who take
vacations), there are many groups and
individuals opposed to Thomas’
conﬁrmation. But none are more outraged

"than the National Association of Travel»

Agencies and Their Lobbyists (or TRAP for
short). At least, they would be outraged if
TRAP existed. -

Before you know it, the day will come
when we will visit local points of interest

  ?“d "0! 3* ?.“f-‘.i‘°  3‘? 

 

rabble from the out—of-town rabble, and
this would cause a great deal of confusion.
But getting back to Thomas: to confirm

or not to confirm? Can a man who has

more frequent-ﬂyer mileage than Charles
Lindbergh really be trusted to help make
decisions on the highest court in the land?
Does it make any difference that the

odometer on his Volvo is probably well i '

over 100,000? (Okay, I admit, I don’t know
what kind of car he has.) ‘

How relevant to his overall qualiﬁcations
is this whole travel business? Does he
know the quickest way to get to downtown
Washington from the Beltway?

The answers to these questions will no
doubt come up in his conﬁrmation
hearings. I don't know the answers myself,
but I know one thing’s for certain.

If Thomas gets confirmed,‘ then Bush 9. ‘ S

had better put a locking gas cap on Air
Force One. You can never be too careful
with those Supreme Court Justices.

A year ago Pitt entered the
third week of the football season '
with a 2-0 record.

They had not allowed a
touchdown and were headed
toward a matchup with the
powerful Oklahoma Sooners in
Norman, Okla. The players talked
of whipping Oklahoma in front
of ‘thousands of screaming

‘crimson-and-cream fans. Pitt
starting quarterback Alex Van
Pelt began talk of a “major, major
bowl game.” Then the wheels
came off somewhere on the way
to Oklahoma. Pitt got smoked by
the Sooners and never fully
recovered.

The Panthers have a whole
new attitude this season. Gone
are the wild predictions and cocky

attitudes from one year ago.
Things go one day at a time, even
after their 35-14 Win OVCT
Southern Mississippi.

“I'm. not looking any farther
ahead than T emple,” head coach
Paul Hackett said. “Many of the
pro scouts tell me they might be
the most talented team in the
East right now.” Hackett may
have forgotten that Penn State,
another eastern team, had just
defeated Cincinnati 81-0. Also,
Temple had not yet been

' defense for two TDs

By Derek Willis
Asst. Sports Editor

It" was Chris Bouyer’s big
chance: He had broken free from
the secondary, and, with every
pair of eyes in the stadium on
him, he raced to grab the pass
and sail into the endzone for a

. 50-yard score".

And then he dropped the ball.

“I told Chris after the [dropped
pass] not to worry about us
throwing to him, because we’d
come back to him,”. head coach
Paul Hackett said.

Six plays later,‘ Bouyer found
himself in the endzone again,
this time with -the ball and a 15-
yard touchdown reception, which
gave Pitt a 16-0 lead in Saturday’s
35-14 win over Southern
Mississippi. ‘

“On that first pass, I should
have just laid out and taken the
40-yard catch, but I was thinking
touchdown, andl dropped it,”
Bouyer said.

Bouyer, a redshirt junior from
Detroit, had never caught a
touchdown pass in his collegiate

career. In fact that first touchdown '

(he had a 20-yarder to go along
with the first one) was just his
14th career reception, six of which
have come this year.

Most of those other catches
came last year, when Bouyer
served as backup to Darnell
Dickerson at, split end. But this

year, after being switched to
ﬂanker, he is expected to be a
leader of a receiving corps that,
prior to last week’s opener, had
never caught a single touchdown
pass.~

“Chris is a featured receiver
thisyear, “ Hackett said. “Two
years ago it was Henry Tuten; last

“year it was Olanda [Truitt], and

now it’s Chris’ chance. And I
have all the conﬁdence in the
world in him.”

If that’s true, then Bouyer has
some big shoes to fill. Truitt
averaged over‘18 yards a catch
last year on his way to 895

 



 

receiving yards, and Tuten put.

up similar numbers in 1989.
But one criticism of Pitt’s
receivers over the last few years
is that they didn’t catch the ball in
traffic; they were unable to make
the play in heavy coverage. This
year's crew has already shown a
willingness to take ' a hit, and
Bouyer is leading by example.

“Nothing makes me happier‘

than to see a receiver make the
tough catch in coverage, when
he knows he’s going to get hit,”
quarterback Alex Van Pelt said.

Bouyer accounted for 82 of
Pitt's 225 receiving yards and
became the first Pitt wide receiver
this year to catch more than one
pass in a game.

“Chris is really coming around, ”
Van Pelt said, “and he's going to
get even better."

whipped 41-3 by Alabama.

An element that appears to be
working for the Panthers this
year, unlike the past season, is
the defense. While they did not
allow a touchdown in the first
two games last season, they
defeated the likes of Ohio
University and Boston College.
Over the last nine games of the
year, they gave up an average of
31.5 points a game, including a
45-0 shutout by Miami and a 52-
10 pasting by Oklahoma.

West Virginia scored above that
average last year, also, racking
up 38 points on Pitt’s sieve-like
defense, and, tailback Michael
Beasley appeared unstoppable,
as he toasted the Panthers for 197
rushing yards.

The Panthers marked up what
linebacker Ricardo McDonald
referred to as “sweet revenge”
last week in their 346 nationally
televised win over the
Mountaineers. The spark that lit
the Panthers in that one was
redshirt senior Steve Israel’s
performance.

Israel intercepted the first pass
thrown by WVU quarterback
Darren Studstill and returned a
kickoff 73 yards to turn the
momentum Pitt’s way. Israel
doesn’t iapear to have looked
back ever since.

This pastweek against Southem
Mississippi, after the Golden
Eagles drove the ball 61 yards in
13 plays, Israel read USM
quarterback Tommy Waters’ three
step drop, picked off the pass
and raced 81 yards for Pitt’s first
touchdown.

The Pitt volleyball team lost
only two games as it won three
matches on its first road trip of the
season this past weekend.

The Panthers swept North
Carolina in front of 475 fans in
Chapel Hill Friday night by scores
of 15-13, 15-8, 15-10.

They made 16 hitting errors in

percentage of .200, but the

Pitt Coach Sue Woodstra

bench into the lineup.

Melanie Gustafson, a six-foot

‘The Panthers stayed in Chapel
Hill to face Texas-Arlington
Saturday. They lost the first game

match and the next three games
15-3, 15-7, 15-7.

Pitt had 16 hitting errors again
but a much better kill percentage
of .345. Service errors were up
again, with 15.

Lucanie’s 19 kills led the team,
but the play‘ of senior -outside
hitter Linda Zols may have been
the most important factor.

She had struggled in Pitt’s first
four matches, with 21 kills and
17 errors, including nine kills

second score of the year,_
however. With 1:04 left in the
game, Waters completed a pass
to USM tailback Michael Welch.
Donsville Savariau, who started
because Lex Perkins was
suspended for one game due to
an altercation that took place
earlier in the year, forced a
fumble. Israel scooped the ball

_ up on the run and streaked 35

yardsfor the touchdown.

While Israel appears to be the
biggest reason for the
improvement over last year's
Panthers, he credits his success
to the entire defensive unit.

“We decided as a team that we
didn’twant to go 3-7-1 anymore,”
Israel said. “We began getting
ready for this season way before

. [fall camp at] Johnstown. We

started almost right after the end
of the season last year. The whole
defense is like one big piston; we
function like one big machine,
and everyone plays a part.”
Indeed, the entire defensive
unit appears to be on a mission.
They had not been scored on in
five quarters before the third
quarter of Saturday’s game, when
they gave up their first touchdown

A of the year.

Junior Keith Hamilton, who

. throughout his career ‘has been

criticized for inconsistency,
turned in a superb defensive effort
against- the Golden Eagles.
Hamilton had four tackles for
losses, including two sacks and a
pass deﬂection. First—year player
Tom Tumulty followed up a
strong debut performance in
which he had 11 tackleswith a
nine-tackle performance against
USM.

\While the Panthers appear to
have bounced back from last

season, they look at next week’s .

game as another chance for a
payback. '

“Temple just came in here last
year and humiliated us,” Hackett
said. “They’re a great team, and
coach Berndt has done a great
job bringing them from 1-10 two
years ‘ago to 7-4 last year. This
game will put us over the" hump
if we win.”

With a large crop of returning
letter—winners and a strong dose
Ofexperience, this year’s women's
tennis team is looking to improve
on last season’s 10-12 record,
which was ninth in the Big East.

Head coach George
Dieffenbach doesn't want to
divulge any team secrets as to
who would be where come the
first match, but he is confident
with his roster.

“This year’s team is definitely
stronger than ,we’ve had in the
past,” said Dieffenbach, whois
starting his 16th season at Pitt.
“We have almost our whole team
returning from last year, which
will be a plus.”

The Lady Panthers lost two
players, Jill Cohen (15-12)_and
Sue Bononno (4-2), to graduation,
butwhere these two left off, juniors
Julie LoPrinzi and Erica Devins try
to pick up the slack. The Lady
Panthers also suffered a major
loss when Kathryn Bratton, who
played No. 2 singles and No. 1
doubles for much of last year as a
first-year student, transferred to
Millersville University near
Lancaster.

LoPrinzi, .presently nursing a

wrist injury, is returning for her
third season. She has established
herself as one of the top players

‘on the team as well as in the Big

East. Since her first year, she has
compiled a singles record of 31-
19 and a doubles record of 27-24.
Dieffenbach lists her as one of the
leaders on the squad.

“I don't really consider myself a
team leader because I think the
whole team is equal,” LoPrinzi
said. “But in a way I guess since
I play either one or two singles,
you could say I’m sort of a leader.”

Although LoPrinzi feels good
about her Off—seasOn training, she
is concerned about playing in the
Big East. ,

“I did horrible in the Big East
last season.” LoPrinzi said. “This
year I want to get better, because
it can’t get any worse.”

Devins is also returning for her
third season, and Opponents
should look for her to be playing‘
singles, where she compiled a 9-
3 mark last year. In all probability
she will be teamed up with
LoPrinzi on the doubles side of
the court, where she feels she
needs the most improvement.

“The team has gotten better in
the past years,” Devins said. “But
the conference will be tough
again, and it's going to take some

 

 

work.”

Incidentally LoPrinzi and_
Devins are roommates, and two 
years ago Devins played No. I1‘ 4,
singles, and LoPrinzi played No. 
2. Last year thatwas reversed, I
and Dieffenbach looks for the '

same this season.

“Because we are roommates‘ I
we are very supportive of'each »
Other,” Devins said. “It’s great
this way. I wouldn’t have it any 9

other way.”

Other returning players are 
seniors Chris Orie, Gwen McIntyre 7’,
and Jennifer Rohm, juniors Josie . j
Neiswenter, Karen Rearick and»-
Cheryl Sheppard and sophomore f

Barb McCarthy.

Newcomers to this year’s squad 1

year’s squad, that should change‘ H

Lucanie hopes to overcome last year’s frustrations

By Ryan Buncher
_ Sta1fIVr1'ter

Ann Marie Lucanie stalks the
sideline during a Pitt volleyball
match against Miami (Ohio). It is
one of the rare times she is not

A playing in the match. She tries to

keep in the game, stay loose, be
ready to go. There is no sign of
the frustration of another time on
the sidelines.

Return to last season, a time
when Lucanie stood on the

- ~sidelines, but she needed the aid

of crutches. She missed 13
matches due to an ankle injury,

including two against Pitt’s biggest
rival, Penn State.

“That was frustrating," Lucanie
said. “It was a different situation
because I was missing matches
because I washurt. It was my first
year playing at Pitt, and Penn
State was a very important match
for the whole team. I got hurt the
weekend before [Penn State
visited Pitt], and I was looking
forward to that match and I really
thought we could win it. I had
conﬁdence in them, and Heather
[Hollands] took my position.
There wasn’t frustration that they
weren’t doing a good job; it was

frustrating that I couldn’t be out
there.”

This is not just any player out of
the lineup. Lucanie led the team
in kills when she was hurt last
year and is doing so again this
season. More than that is the way
she does it.’

Pitt has many quality players,
but when watching a match, she
is the most impressive. A powerful
spike draws a crowd reaction. It
seems to be a little tougher for
the other team to take than a
weak shot that is just placed well.
A player that can be physically
overpowering brings out

anticipation when she is set well,
an anticipation that isn't there
with a player who doesn’t have
that strength. Lucanie has it.
She also has experience. A
native of Don Mills, Ontario,
Lucanie played for the Canadian
Junior National team. The level
of play is not the best in the
world, but it is just below it. She
hesitates to say which she prefers,
college or junior national play,
but the answer is no surprise.
“I enjoy playing for the junior
national team because you are
representing your country,”
Lucanie said. “Also the

competition is a lot higher, and
the intensity is a lot higher. You
are playing worldwide. You have
Canada on your back. Other
countries, you walk into the gym,
and they know who you are,
whereas ‘you can walk into a
gym in your own country, and
they won't even know who you
are."

The question arises if national
play is in her past. She came to
Pitt to continue her education.
But after that’

“I still have aspirations of
playing for the national team.
That is one of my goals: to go
home and play for the national
team,” Lucanie said, who believes
she can play for the top national
team in Canada. “[Pitt Coach] Sue
Woodstra is really helping me
out. She knows I want to go back
and play. She’s helping me right
now. She’s helping me work on

things I need to work on and .

things she feels I need to work
on to make it at that level.”
Woodstra played on the U.S.
national team for many years,
including being part of the team
that took home the silver medal

in 1984. “She has been a lot of ‘

help off and on the court,”
Lucanie said. “She’s critical, but
it’s a positive critical. She’s telling
me, ‘OK, Ann Marie, in order for
you to be here, you have to work
on this,’ and _I don’t have a
problem with her telling me that,
and it is helpful, too, because it
lets me know what I have to
work on.” . .
Still this is a player very focused
on winning where she is now.
When she was hurt last year
Lucanie did not distance herself
on the team. She stresses that the
players on the bench are very
important in giving
encouragement and feedback.

, -‘This is more important for Pitt,

which does not draw large

"crowds for home matches.

The focus is also on this season.
Pitt lost its first match of the
season, an error-plagued defeat
at the hands of Penn State.
Lucanie ﬁnally got her first shot
at the Lions and was not happy
with the way she played. The
Panthers go to State College
October 23. Lucanie said, “I feel
very conﬁdent we will beat them. ”

In Lucanie’s ﬁrst matches last
season Pitt faced three teams
that were in the top 20’ last season:
Wisconsin, Duke and top—ranked

teams to beat in the Big East are '

newcomer Miami and old foes
Boston College and Syracuse, but
he feels more confident in this
year’s team.

“Miami is new to the Big East
this year, and I know they are
going to be tough to play,”
Dieffenbach said. “But BC and
Syracuse are excellent teams, and
they give us trouble every year.
This year should be different.”

Pitt soccertriumphs
in ’91 season opener

 

By Christopher Block
Stajf Writer

The Pitt varsity soccer team
kicked off its 1991 campaign
Saturday with a victory over
Geneva College in Beaver Falls,
Pa.

In their first game of the season,
the Panthers were able to control
the tempo and the scoreboard
while pulling out a hard—fought,
2-0 win.

The Panthers’ opening day
lineup was a mix of returning
starters along with some new
faces. To start-, Pitt Coach Joe

Luxbacher opened with Tim '

Sobelman in goal and senior co-
captain Mike Watson at sweeper.
The next line of defense for the
squad consisted of team veterans
Mark Brehm and Brian Pelligrino
at wing backs and newcomer
Bobby Dyer and veteran Scott
McCurry at marking back.

Offensively for the team, co-
captains Nick Liberati and JR.
Perdue played at the midﬁeld
position, while the forwards
consisted of veterans IvanAmayo,
Ted Noethling and first-year
player Erik Prex.

Pitt’s ﬁrst goal was scored by
sophomore Ted Noethling. With
an abundance of time still
remaining in the first half,
Noethling bolted outpast a group
of defenders, gained control of
the ball and slid the shot past the
goalkeeper.

Senior Liberati praised the play
of his teammate, Noethling, as he
said, “Ted showed good
composure, and he anticipated
the play real well.”

   

LEISURE LEARNING

Late in the first half senior Don
Overmeir fed a good pass to
senior Bill Trappen, who narrowly
missed adding a second score for
Pitt.

Liberati also had a scoring
opportunity in the first half on a
penalty shot but was also denied
a goal by the Geneva goalkeeper.

In the second half the Panthers
were able to add a second score
when Liberati poked a shot in.

The Pitt squad was awarded a
direct kick near the Geneva goal.
The Geneva squad set up a human
wall in front of the goal to deflect
any incoming pass. This wall
allowed Liberati to slide past the
wall and receive the pass from
rookie Erik Prex.

As the game came to a close
Overmeir gained control of the
ball and barely missed adding a
third goal. I

Overall the Panthers had a fine
performance, and Liberati was
quick to give credit to some of his
teammates. “Prex played well.

Bobby Dyer had a strong game, ’

and Mark Brehm had an awesome

game. The guys off the bench did 4

great. Don [Overmeir] and Andy
T souris played well.”

Next up for the Panthers are
the Carnegie Mellon Tartans. The
Panthers lost a tough contest to
CM last year, and this year they’re
looking for revenge. “We
definitely have a score to settle
with them," Liberati said.

“The whole team is pumped
upto play them,” Sobelman said.

The Panthers will put their
undefeated record on the line
TuesdaynightatCarnegieMellon.

UCLA. Pitt won two and took

and confidence early thathelped A g I

history.

A V Pitt did have occasional ,
problems with letting up a bit

against lesser competition, most

notably a loss later in the season

to Duke.

“It's hard to get motivated

[against lesser competitionl,”
Lucanie said. “If I were to play
Penn State and I were to play
Duquesne, to be honest, my

level of intensity would be much '

higher if I was playing Penn

State, just because you know A

it’s going to be a tough match.
You know you have to work
hard and be into it all the time.
When you play a team that’s
weaker, you get distracted, and

you tend to make a lot more

errors because they are making
a lot more errors,” Lucanie said.
Flash back to the Miami (Ohio)

only one error, as the team

plays a very solid match against I

a team it should beat. The story
is much the same that night as
the Panthers dispatch Arizona

Wildcat team that gave Penn

Lions are a young team, still

letting up that little bit and‘

A women’s studies professor
and two students wrote a letter of
complaint to the band director
because of the “sexist” bathing-
suit style uniforms and the weight
standards for the Touch of Blue
majorette line.

No action has been taken yet,
although the band director said
he would review the situation.

Kuntu

Continuedfrom page 2
Broadway as Ma Rainey’s Black
Bottom.

Years later Lillie staged Ma
Rainey’s at Kuntu as well. The
two have kept in touch, and Lillie
takes the company with her to

New York for each of Wilson’s‘ I

openings.
August Wilson isn’t the only

9

distinguished alumnus that Kuntu
can boast. Monte Russell, who
was on Broadway in Wilson’s
Fences and Joe Tumer’s ComeAnd
Gone, and the late Kathleen
Collins, author of Long TimeSince
Yesterday, started there as well.
Esther Rolle, best known to

television audiences as Florida
on “Good Times,” came here to

— ' _g_- :-_:-,_«'u.'—'.-,'-,'.‘. .. ,. ..... .'. .. - .54-4

star in the 25th-anniversary
production of Lorraine Hans-
berry’s A Raisin in the Sun. “We
did the original version without
the Broadway cuts," Lillie said.
Lillie would like to bring in
more professional actors into
-Kuntu. “But it still will always be
a training ground for young actors.
There’s a lot of talent in Pittsburgh

‘. 4-.-. . ..__. ._......a.-_._- -- -._,,. , . .-

 I want to remain a company
producing new works by young
writers, I would love to see a
graduate theater program in black
studies and eventually an [Actors ’l
Equity Theater."

After every Kuntu performance
the company holds discussions
with the audience on issues the
play has raised or current topics

such as interracial casting.

Kuntu, an African word
meaning “multi-dimensional
growth, goes back to what I was
saying earlier, that we’re not just
here to entertain,” Ellis said.

“Maybe,” Lillie said after a slight
pause. “My goal is to correct
images as they’ve been portrayed
in the last 25 years.”
