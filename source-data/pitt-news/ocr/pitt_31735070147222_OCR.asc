Groups find allocations confusing

Marissa Meredyth
Senior Staﬁ"l/1_/riter

When the Phi Alpha Delta Law Fra-

ternity only received partial funding,

from the Student Government Board
at last week’s meeting, it only added to

the discontent amongstudent groups
over the allocations process. '

g The student group is one of sev-
eral organizations who, in the past
few weeks, have accused the alloca-
tions process of being confusing and
inconsistent. Butthe Board maintains
its positionthatthe process isfairand
clear. . .

 

In the pastweek the recently certi-
ﬁed Phi Alpha‘Delta Law Fraternity
opted to not attend a North Caro-
lina conference after only receiving
ﬁmds for four members and one hotel
room. '

It requested ﬁmdingfor two rooms
and seven members, but the Alloca-
tions Committee recommended the
Board onlyapprove funding for four.

V The group explained that it needed two

rooms sothatmen andwomenwould

not have to sleep. in the same room,‘

but the Board upheld the committee’s
recommendation. '
The Board denied funding based

onprecedents,whichareoften-cited, .

unwritten rules of the Board that are
not mentioned in the allocations man-
ual. This is one in anumber of requests
that has caused student organization V
leaders to contest the allocation pro- ,

‘ cess and challenge how the new 2011

Boardis deciding requests. ,
Allocations Annoyance _
Phi Alpha Delta, which is not r - -

Founding President Patricia Leftwich

She added it was important that

This request was only its second
since becoming certiﬁed. Phi Alpha
Delta Business manager Malcolm
Wmne said the ﬁrst request was for
its $350 charteringfee on Nov. 1. This
was automatically approved by the
Allocations Committee, since it was
under $500.00. The Board onlyhears
requests over that amount.

Pitt

recycles its
way to top
in Big East ,

Brett Murphy
For The Pitt News

Pitt resides nearthe top ofthe BigEastin‘ l_
in a number of sports, and at the mo-

ment, it dominates the conference in
recycling, too. _

The Pitt Housing Department, Fa-
cilities Management, Residence Life
and Free the Planet are in their third
year participating in the national Re-
cycl_eMania competition. Each year,
the University has received more re-
cyclables as consciousness grows, and
Pitt currently leads the BigEast intotal

pounds of recycledmaterial this year,.. .. V

saidAllisonPlummer,st11dentassistant

ability coordinator for Pitt’s Housing

Department.

According to RecycleMania’s statis-
tics, Pitthas recycled almost 290,000‘
pounds of waste so far in the competi-
tion — almost 30,000 pounds more
than the same time in last year. In a
two-week “preliminary” competi-
tion, Rutgers topped the nation and
Pitt came in 67th in terms of overall
recycling. - . ’

Plummer said that updated statis-
tics - to be released this week — will
showthatPittistoppingthe BigEastin

The 10th—armual competition —
run by the College and University Re-
cycling Council, part of the nonproﬁt
National Recycling Council —— tries to
‘encourage recycling on college cam-

Cathedral extends beyond 36th ﬂoor, offers view

Keith Gillogly
Senior Staﬁ Writer

Popular trivia for Pitt students might ask,
“What’s the height of the Cathedral of Learn-
mg?” (535 feet) or, “How many windows does
it have?” (2,529). But what’s above the 36th
ﬂoor of the Cathedral? '

That question will leave most students
scratching their heads. '

For the general public, access above the
36th ﬂoor is not allowed. Some of the ﬂoors
above the 36th house machinery for the build-
ing’s functioning, but the 40th ﬂoor contains

the EV. Babcock Memorial Room, an ornate
meeting room with a panoramic View of sur-
rounding Pittsburgh. The room was construct-
ed with a $327,000 grant from the»Babcock
family to be used as a meeting room for the
University’s Board of Trustees and was of-
ﬁcially dedicated in 1958.

‘ Capping the campus’ identifying land— 3
mark, the Babcock Room might not be seen i

by many Pitt students, but it’s meticulously
maintained.

Despite its age, the room is in pristine

condition. Phillip Hieber — a senior area co-
ordinator with Property and Facilities Man-

agement — said that the wooden walls, with C

their intricately carved geometric patterns,

are resealed every two years. Leaf-patterned‘

curtains adorn each window. Visitors will have
a hard time spotting any dust on the three
long, wooden meeting tables. Except for the
lighting, ﬁirniture and carpeting, all of the
room’s features are original —‘ even the eleva-
tor used to access it. Exceptfor emergency exit
stairwells, access to the top floor is limited to a
single small elevator that connects to the 36th
ﬂoor. A portrait of E.V. Babcock sits against
one of the walls. \

The Babcock Room is not used everyday.
It’s only used periodically by various University
departments to hold meetings andfseminars,

Hieber said. Pitt’s philosophy and human’ re-
sources departments recently held seminars
there. In the summer, however, the room is
rarely used. There’s no air conditioning, and
temperatures can be stiﬂing. Hieber said the
room’s function as a meeting place — and its
subsequent restriction —isn’t very different
than the rooms reserved for meetings in other
University buildings. ‘ 3
Anyone who’svisited the 35th or 36th ﬂoor
of the Cathedral can peer out on the impressive
View of surrounding Pittsburgh. But spectators
have to traverse from room to room to get a

‘ full view. It’s the panoramic view offered by

the surrounding windows of the single room

Plummer atttibutedthisyears success directly

“Every year student awareness gets a little
better,” Plummer said. ‘Andwith great help from
the RAs and facilities, it’s hard to walk anywhere
around campus without seeingsigns for [Recyle-

She saidthe Student Government Board mem-
bers have taken an interest in raising awareness
by  armouncements at public meetings
—— much to the avaﬂ of Ryan Gayman and Em-
ily-Hoover, who are the Free the Planet liaisons
in SGB. v .

“Right now,  sort of in charge‘ofdis—
serninating informationto [the campus] through
student avenues,” Plummer said. “And mostof
the volunteer work was coordinated using Free
the Planet labor.” ,

The signs, ﬂiers and posters hanging around
campus and throughout the dorms augment
this year’s revamped RecyleMania campaign
— which includes recycle bins in nearly every
campus building, alinkon rny.pitt.edu andanew
commercial-grade compostingsysteminMarket
Central, Plummer said. The composter breaks
down the organic matter in leltover food scraps
into a soil—like product that recycles nutrients
back intothe soil. ' . A

“The entire composting process results in a
total waste reduction of 85% in Market Central
and produces a rich soil amendmentthat can be
used to grow more fruits and vegetab1es,”accord—

those students who put in the eifort to recycle.

“It’s always up to the student. We put every-

. thing there for them and get everything in the

housing buildings,” Hefﬂey said. “But it comes
down toithe students caring about  the
extra 10 steps to recycle their water bottle.”
Lauren Stander and Troy Novak gladly take
those 10 steps — or more — everyday
Novak — a freshman in Tower A —.goes
through’ four water bottles every day and rides
the elevator up from his room on thethird ﬂoor
to the 18th toput them in the RecyleMania bins
there. . '
_ “I do_n’tseeany reasonwhyyouwouldn’tbe do-
ingit,”Novak said. “I knowwe’re inacompetition

with other schools, but it comes down to simply

choosing the recycling bin over the trash bin.” 5

Stander_is a freshman in Holland Hall, a ‘

residence building that Plurnmer said performs
consistently well inthe competition. Stander only
makes a small trip down the hall to recycle her
plastics and paper, but with the added initiative
from RecycleMania, she’s,been making a con-
scious effort to not throw away any recyclables.
“I saw the barmer in the quad and posters

all over towers, then I checked out the website

‘and saw what a big deal it was around colleges.”

Stander said, holding two newspapers she had
just plucked from the Tower’s patio ground. “I’m

Peregrine falcons call top of Cathedral home

Cathedral 4 2

on the 40th ﬂoor that attracts people, Hieber
said. -

“You get four views of the surrounding city
of Pittsburgh. On a clear day, you can see for
miles and miles and miles,” Hieber said.

The View can be up to 50 miles. Since the
surrounding area used to be covered by water,
one professor used to bring his geology class
up there to observe how the land had been
shaped.

But not all of the sights are off in the ho-
rizon. In the corner of the southern wall of
the Cathedral rests the nest of two peregrine
falcons. Lucky visitors will catch aview of the
falcons in their nest or spy them perched on
the stone precipice just feet away from the
window. But get too close and they’ll swoop off

their perch and protectively circle their nest. ‘

Even if the falcons aren’t home to receive Visi-
tors, a glancearound the balcony might reveal
a ruffled pile of gray feathers —- remnants of
the falcons’ pigeon lunch. '

The falcons are kept under surveillance by
a pair of video cameras, one of which can pick
up sound and has a zoom function. They’re
viewable online, at aviary.org.

Those reserving the room have theoption
to have their meeting catered. But provid-
ing catering is no picnic. Although there are
two small kitchens connected to the Babcock
Room, the limited elevator space means cater-

ing crews sometimes have to start bringing up
lunchtime supplies by 8 a.m., Hieber said.

As the room was once used as the venue
for Board of Trustees’ meetings, the board’s
number of members grew and the room proved
inadequate. Fire safety codes limit occupancy
to 35 people. There’s also no bathroom on the
40th ﬂoor.

“Squishing all the people into this room
would just not work,” saidjohn Fedele, spokes-
man for Pitt.

Hieber said he’s heard reports of students
trying to sneak up the 40th ﬂoor. But operating
the elevator requires a key.

The Cathedral is 42 stories high, but the
top two stories are just part of the building’s
stone structure. All four sides of these stories
have three ﬂashing lights on each side required
by the Federal Aviation Administration for air
trafﬁc safety, Hieber said.

The 37th through 39th ﬂoors contain ma-
chinery for operating the building’s elevators
and sprinkler systems.

i ‘ Pitt freshman Kourtney Bemecker said she
didn’t know what was above the 36th ﬂoor.

“I just knew there was a point you couldn’t
go anymore, and it was really depressing when

, I found that out,” she said. “I pay tuition, I

thinkI should be able to go up there —— at least
before I graduate. It should be a graduation

SGB to meet with fr

Allocations 4 3

during the meeting, it simply can not spend the
entire meeting explaining one decision.

The Decision

The Allocations Manual states that there is a
$2,000-a-year conference cap for student organi-
zations, but it does not documentthe four—person
precedent often insisted on by the Board.

The fraterr1ity’s request of $607.56 was well
under the $2,000 limit. The Board unanimously

approved $219.72 and denied $387.84 at its meet- ’

ing last week
This would mean Leftwich would have to
share a room with three male students.
The ﬁmding application does not currently

- require information regarding the gender or

the group. V

She encouraged organizations to come to
the office on the eighth ﬂoor of the William Pitt
Union with any concerns, preferably before a
decision has been rendered. ‘

“[Student organizations] can complain all
they want,abut if [they] don’t come to talk to us,
no understanding can be reached,”.she said.

Moving Forward .

Leftwich plans to meetwiththe Board, Alloca-
tions Committee, Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
and other Pitt administrators in the upcoming

week. _

She insisted that the organization was not
tryingto attack individual members of the Board
or committee, and that there were no harsh feel-
ings. T
“We aren’twagingsome crusades,” Leftwich
said.

Bane mentioned that he is currentlyworking
heavily with Terry Milani, allocations adviser, to
update and revise the current allocations manual
to clarify policies to which SGB is bound to pre-
vent future misunderstandings.

Google gets ‘good-er’

Your term paper is due tomorrow,
and — save for a cover page — you’re
hungry for pages and sources. Librar-
ians might tell you to scour databases,
journals and even library catalogues.
But ifyou’re likemanycollege students,
the researchprocess oftenstattswitha
Google search.

At crucial moments like these, you
demand quality from your Google
search results — your grade could
hinge on it.

This is how G00gle’s recent effort
to curb the inﬂuence of Internet ‘‘con-
tent farms” makes sense for college
students — when time matters, your
focus sh0uldn’tbewastedon sites solely
meant to lure you in, and not inform.

The controversybrews over Google
Inc.’s crackdown on contentfarms —
thesearewebsites thatactivelyproduce
large abscesses oflow-quality content
to increase their Google search rank-
ings, andby extension, advertising rev-
enue. Afterreceivingcomplaints about
“fam1ing,”G0oglehaslaunchedamajor
change to its search algorithm, suppos-
edly onethatprovides “betterrankings
for high-quality sites,” according to a
blog post by Google spokesmen Arnit
Singhal and Matt Cutis.

Whenever an authority sticks the
“quality” label on one product and
withholds it from another, the losers
are bound to cry foul. Organic_Pop, a
commenter onaWebmas/terwo1d.com
forum, decried the changes, writing “I
lost35 percent of my tratﬁc allat once.”
Lennyz, another commenter, called the
measurea“tnassacre.”G00gle says only
11.8 percent of results will be affected.

But if the algorithmic change ac-
complishes exactly what Singhal and
Cutts say itwill-—-thatis, improve rank-
ings for sites with original “research,
in-depth reports, thoughtiiil analysis

and so on” — Internet users might be
betteroﬂf. 0
The catch, of course, is that this

Google—style content pruning might
betoohigh-mindedtoput into practice.
Internet operations are by no means
black-and-white. As an example, De-
mand Media——vvidelytouted f0rcon—
tent farming — claims that rankings
actually increased for its eHow.com site
but dropped for its other sites. Other
smallerwebmasters who attest to no
“farming” practices say they’ve been
hurt by the ranking reshuflling

Even ifthe blades Google uses come
with rough edges, wethinkattempting
to trim the “10w-quality” fat is laud-
able.

Sure, nonﬁction writing and jour-
nalism graduates canhave _a hardtime
pocketingpost-baccalaureate cash. But
payingthousands ofthem — Demand
Media has 13,000 freelance writers,
according to the Associated Press —
to compose cursory, useless articles
on whatever Internet users tnight be
searching only advances the proﬁts
of the content farmer while adversely
affecting the pursuit of knowledge in
general. In our view, young journalis-
tic potential that could otherwise be
realized in legitimate newsrooms is
squandered by content farms.

In a much broader sense, content
farms are not an acceptable answer to
the forever-burning question: “Where
willjournalismbeloyearsfrom now?”
Atleastit’s notananswer our stomachs
can handle.

And for the online masses who
value the Internet’s ability to grease
the wheels of information supply and
demand — like procrastinating col-
legiate essay writers —— you can pick
up antacids at one of 0akland’s many

THE STAMAITACK /

Nocure for Bieber fever

Even The Pitt_News columnists are not immune to Justin Bi.ebe'r’s charm

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

I’m kind of crushing onjustin Bieber ’

right now.
It’s not his adorable swoosh hair-

style orhis sweet, purevoicethatmakes

- my knees buckle, but it’s his recent in-

terviewinR0llingSt0nethatmakes me
thinkabout Bieber andwhathe-means
to us as a culture. ‘

Beyond the looks and singing, the
interview reveals a personality con-
tainingsomething often missingfrom
popular culture, be it from entertain-
ment, business or politics. He seems
to be genuinely honest and seems to
genuinely speak what he thinks. And

- now that his rather odd comments

on abortion have been retracted as'a
journalism error on the part of Roll-
ing Stone, we can view the piece as a
simply a look at Bieber as who he is: a
16-year-old who says whatever is on
his mind.
He doesn’t seemto have —— howto
saythis nicely—very developed ideas

about life. It seems like he gets most of '

his opinions from his mother, and he
dutifully spits them back out when he
is asked about them. These ideas, too,
amount to little more than platitudes

about good living and friendship and’

love. There isn’tanythingnotable about
the content. f

But something seems different
about him than other young pop su-
perstars of today, who all generally
hail from the Disney factory of enter-
tainment. The Miley Cyruses, Jonas
Brothers and Hilary Duffs of the world
were netted at a young age and then

consciously morphed into caricatures
of family values and wholesomeness
designedto capture the hearts of moms
and tweens inMiddle America. Theyall
begantheirperformingcareers before
their teenage years andwere thus more
easily moldable.

Bieber, on the other hand, did not A

beginperformingonalarge stage until
his teenaged years had already begun.
Corporations and record labels couldn’t
createabrandfromhim—his styleand
branding already existed, and he was
too old to be transformed. Without a
stronghandto guide the singer’s media

development, he has a more organic .

element to him. This is his appeal. It’s
not anythjngparticularly special about

' his voice — which, while good, isn’t

unstoppable —— that makes him fasci-

' nating,butthisgenuinenessthatrnakes

him appealing to adults from Conan
O’Brien to Kim Kardashianto Usher.
Another pop culture phenomenon K
gets its appeal from the same source:
the ‘jersey Shore.” It, too, features eight

"people who seem, either because of

their accents, editing or active “char-
acter” choices, to be very authentic.
So although they act in ways no differ-
entthanpast casts ofthe “RealW0rld,”
they endure with stronger popularity
because there isn’t that same level of
produced personality. We feel as if we
are witnessing people being very true
versions ofthemselves. ‘

This, I think, iswhy Bieber and the
“Jersey Shore” enjoytheir currentlevels
of immense popularity. They serve as

-foils to the kind of produced imagery

and personalitywe are accustomed to
inside and outside of entertainment;

_Politics is one such realm outside

Simkin: A tasty, albeit terriing, cookie treat

 _ Sarah Simkin
Columnist

 

There are a lot of thoughts you don’t
want to pop into your head when you
walk into your kitchen —— “What a
disgusting mess,” “Are those ants?”
and, “Someone has ﬁnished all of my
milk AGAIN,” for instance.

But I bet you’ve never thought,
“Good God, those things are crimes
against man and nature and are going
to kill us all in our sleep!”

I have, when my roommate de-
cided to experiment with the Internet
sensation of Oreo-stuffed chocolate
chip cookies. The result was ob-
scenely heavy monstrosities bigger
than your ﬁst, covering all available
counter space — they wouldn’t ﬁt
on the normal cookie—cooling rack.
It looked as though the kitchen had
been taken overby tiny limb-deﬁcient
aliens, and I didn’t feel entirely safe
until they were all ﬁrmly secured in

Tupperware.

One might speculate that the com-
bination of two fundamentally deli-
cious entities — Oreos and chocolate
chip cookies —- could yield only good
things. One would be, in this food
columnist’s estimation, dead wrong.
Oreos are one ofthose rare foods that
are actually best when store—bought
as opposed to homemade, much like

Kraft Macaroni 8: Cheese. My room— '

mate, however, operating under her
usual “ o bigor go home” philosophy,
decided to make her own.

She began with a basic chocolate
cookie dough: 2 cups of flour, 1 tea-
spoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of baking
soda, 1 cup of softened butter, 3/4
cup of brown sugar, 3/4 cup of white
sugar, 3/4 cup unsweetened baking
cocoa, 2 eggs and 1 teaspoon vanilla
extract. A note: Tempting as it might
look, do not attempt to snack on raw
unsweetened baking cocoa —— the
people attempting to bake with it
will be cross with you and it really

isn’t tasty.

If you were making cranberry-
walnut—chocolate or triple—chocolate
cookies or some other baked good
that strives to achieve only an every-
day level of decadence, the process.
would stop shortly. For this recipe,
however; bake silver dollar-sized plain
chocolate cookies for 10 minutes at
350 degrees. They will look like ﬂat
wafers, which is ﬁne: The more they
rise and ﬂuff up, the more massive
the resulting cookie will be. .

While those cool, beat together
half a stick of unsalted butter, 1/4 cup
of vegetable shortening, 2 cups con-
fectioners’ sugar and 2 teaspoons of
vanilla extract until light and ﬂuﬂ'y
— this is your Oreo stuﬂing. Cement
the cookies together into moon-pie-
esque sandwiches.

To stuff or to double-stuff: Does
any part of this smack of moderation
to you? Go all out.

Of course, it would be unfair not
to stop at this juncture and appreciate

MOVIE REVIEW

 

Film’s screenplay needs
an ‘Adjustment’

Jennifer Hirsch
Staff Writer

“The Adjustment Bureau”

Director: George Nolﬁ

Starring: Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, John
Slattery .

Universal Pictures

Grade: C

Alittle more than a decade ago, MattDamon took
to the screen as the eponymous main characters
of “Good Will Hunting? and “The Talented Mr.
Ripley.” Despite being aérelative newcomer, he

wooed audiences with his boyish good looks
and quirky innocence.

He has since become a household name
after alternating between starring roles in the
Jason Boume trilogy and supporting roles in
the -“Ocean’s Eleven” franchise. It would seem,
at least from his proven track record, that his
upcomingﬁlm“The Adjustment Bureau” would
be a hit. Sadly, however, it disappoints.

In the ﬁlm based on a Philip K. Dick short

T story, MattDamonstarsasDavidNorris, ayoung ’

Sondheim’s score presents a host of challenges, rewards

Woods 4 8

Composer Stephen Sondheim’s musical pre-
sented ahost oflogistical challenges — in addition
to using a cast of 21 and an orchestra of 11, the
Musical Theatre Club had to prepare forthe show
in seven weeks. This time crunch, Savage said,

 fhrced the group to rehearse on Saturdays and

maintain a stemly focused mentality.

“When mycastgotthe music and scripts, they
just attacked it,” Savage said.

Sondheim’s music is ever-present, ﬁom Ra-
punzel and her prince serenading each other to
the baker ﬁantically searchingforacow as white

as milk. Renownedfor scores like “SweeneyTodd”
and “West Side Story,” the composer strives to
encompass a wide emotional spectrum. Ashley
Adams, who plays the bass keyboard inthe or—
chestra, aﬂirmed this versatility.

“There are deﬁnitely songs that, when pulled
off, will have you balling your eyes out. It can be
very emotional,” Adams said.

The orchesua had to make considerable ad-
justments to accommodate Sondheim’s wishes.
Although there is no French horn or bassoon, a
trumpet, percussion and other necessary instru-

Tup-

‘ ments are inattendance. Of course, with75 musitnl

numbers and48 singingparts, the cast itselffaced

. morethanitsfairshare ofdifﬁculties.

-Adams noted that the music “changes time
signaturesalot,” and Savage described itas“rhyth—
rnically challenging.” _

Gary Kline, associate teaching professor of
musicaltl1eateratCamegie Mellon, acknowledged
the challenge of Sondheim’s music, stating in an
e-mail, “The mostsigniﬁcantfeauire ofSondheim’s
music is the rhythm — it does not follow the nor-
mal meters found in most traditional musicals.

There’s a lot of irregularity that, quite frankly,
is used to make the words clear — notjust as a

gimmick. The W1tch’s song, ‘Stay with Me,’ from .

‘Into TheWoods’ isaperfectexample ofthis ...the
rhythm changes to up the dramatic tension.”

Accordingto Savage, the decision to preform
“Into the Woods” was an easy one. “We have so
much talent. We wanted an opportunity to high-
lightas manypeopleaswe can. We had more space
and wanted to do something bigger.”

"Although the cast and crew were only intro-
duced to the musical in December, Savage had
been envisioning and planning the show since
October. Accordingly, the Musical Theatre Club
has established a partnership with USITI‘ that
makes productions like “Into theWoods’ ’ possible
by providing designers and more space.

As her directorial debut, Savage hopes “Into
the Woods’ ’willbringtogethertheaterjunkies and
anyone curiousto see Rapunzel’s prince challenge
Cinderella’s prince to a duet.

Damon’s acting

outside forces continue to keep them apart.
Soon, Norris discovers that an “adjustment bu-

- reau” —— headed byjohn Slattery of “Mad Men”

fame — controls the fate of the world based on
apredestined plan. ‘ .

, Damon’s character strangely does not ques-
tionthe new circumstances ofhis life. After being
exposed to startling information on par with

A the notion of “Inception,” one would expect the

main character to go through periods of denial
and anger. But Damon’s character acclimates to
his new worldview without a ﬁght.

The chemistry between Blunt and Damon is -

believable enough, but becomes nulliﬁed by_t.he
absurdity of tl1eir situation and their nonchalant

acceptanceofit——-theywotildbebettersuitedas _

ahappy couple inanother setting that didn’t place
the fate of humankind on their shoulders. Blunt
is at least convincing as a modern dancer, if not
the young ingenue dragged into a life-changing
situation. A V B .

Fans of the AMC series “Mad Men” might
enjoytheﬁlmsimply becausejohn Slattery’s char-
acter —-— Damon’s ever-present antagonist — is
strikingly similar to his role on the show. From
his ’60s-style hat and trenchcoat to his stern yet

‘ slydisposition, it mightaswellbe Roger Sterling
chasing Damon across Manhattan.

“The Adjustment Bureau” is adepart:ureﬁ'o
Damon’s otherwise discerning choice of roles. The
premise of the ﬁlm is altogether unbelievable and
further undermined by writing that doesn’t test
the skills» of its main actors. '

A good ﬁlm, in my opinion, makes audiences
reﬂect on their own lives based on the struggles

, of the main characters. This ﬁlm, however, is self-

contained to the pointthatwhen myfriend andI
went out to dinner immediately after seeing it, the
movie didn’t come up in conversation once.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

 

Pitt falls to Villanova on senior night

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ Writer

Chelsea Cole, Taneisha Harri-
son, Shayla Scott andjania Sims
said farewell to the Petersen
Events Center Monday night as
Pitt honored the four seniors
in a pre-game senior day cer-
emony.

Unfortunately, the team
couldn’t close the regular season
with a dramatic win in its ﬁnal
home game. Sims and Scott both
had chances in the paint in the
dying seconds of the game, but
the Villanova Wildcats held on to
knock off the Panthers 54-52.

Down 52-49 in the game’s fi-
nal minute, Cole drove to the
basket and was fouled as she hit
her layup. She converted the free
throw for a 3-point play to tie
the game at 52.

But the Wildcats regained the
lead with 15.9 seconds left when
Marquel Davis fouled guard De-
von Kane as she drove to the rim.
Kane made both free throws and
secured the Villanova victory
after neither Sims nor Scott
could convert a buzzer—beating

layup.

“It was a tough one,” Scott
said in a post—game news confer-
ence. “A lot of games are going
to come down to the last pos-
session, so we work every day in
practice for that  That’s what
it came down to tonight.”

Kane’s free throws'capped a
perfect 9-for-9 night from the
charity stripe for Villanova. Pitt,
meanwhile, wentc8-for-18.

“This game was won and lost

on the free throw line,” Pitt head S .
coach Agnus Berenato said af-

ter the game. “We were a really
good free-throw shooting team.
We’ve never shot 44 percent the
entire year.”

Villanova (11-18, 3-13 Big
East) trailed the entire first
half but took the lead on four
separate occasions after the
intermission. The first three
times Pitt fell behind, Scott hit
a3-pointer to bring the Panthers

' right back into the game.

Scott led all Panthers (13-16,
5-11 Big East) with 20 points,
but she couldn’t hit her chance
in the paint in the game’s ﬁnal
possession.

“We were going for [Sims] or

[Scott]. That’s what we wanted,”
Berenato said. “We got two good
looks at it, and we missed. We
got the play that we wanted 
We were able to go in, and we
missed a shot. Then we actually
got the rebound, and we missed
again.”

Sims ﬁnished 1-for-9 from
the floor for four points. Har-
rison had 11 points.

Cole’s last-minute 3-point
play gave her 10 points to go
with her 15 rebounds —- her
16th double‘-double of the sea-
son. She, Harrison, Scott and
Sims combined for all but three
of Pitt’s baskets. The lone non-
senior scorer for Pitt was Ashlee
Anderson.

Pitt held Villanova, the low-
est—scoring team in the Big East,
to a single basket in the game’s
first 8:45. The Panthers shut
down the Wildcats’ perimeter
shooting and opened the game

I on a nine-minute, 13-2 run.

“Defensively, the first 10 min-
utes of that first half, we were on
point,” Scott said. V

lon pulled Villanova back into
the game and set the stage for

Counting

Senior Staff Writer

 

Pitt lost.on Sunday in overtime
at Louisville, 62-59. And thanks
to an overly excited male cheer-
leader, Pitt had a slim chanceto
tie it up at the end. But instead of
boring you with talk about how
the loss isn’t that big of a deal and
Pitt will still be a No. 1 seed in the
NCAA Tournament, I’m going to
try something new. _

The Oscars took placeon Sun-
day, so in the spirit of complete-
ly piggy—backing off its hype, I
bring you the College Basketball

Oscar’s for my top 10 this week.

10. Best Costume Design -
Pitt. Nike started a recent trend
in uniform design in 2009’with
its new aerographic jerseys. The
jerseys feature a unique design
on the back of the jersey behind
the numbers for each school.
Pitt jumped on board this year
and easily surpassed every other
aerographic jersey on the mar-
ket.

Not only is the Cathedral of
Learning prominently featured,

but there is als“o.an’Oakland*Zoo .
logo — further proof that the V

Oakland Zoo is truly part of the

team and the; best sixth man in

down college basketball’s Oscar Winners

the nation. _ _

9. Lifetime, Achievement
Award —- Nolan Smith. When
I ﬁrst watched a Duke game this
year and saw starting guard Smith
was a senior, my first reaction
was, “Again!?” It seems like this
is his third year as a senior. He’s

been starting since his sopho- .

more year, so it just feels like a

‘ long time. Kudos to him for the

long, successfulcareer.

‘3. Best Actor —Jimmer Fre-
dette. There weren’t even any
other nominees in this category.
In fact, “The Jimmer Show” will
probably win an Emmy next

fall.

SWIMMING AND DIVING

Three Panthers advance
to the ECAC finals   p

Lauren Kirschman
Assistant Sports Editor

Three members of the Pitt swimming and
diving team advanced to the ﬁnals of the
Eastern College Athletic Conference Cham-
pionships on Sunday at Trees Pool.
Freshman Alexander Rodenkirk came

in second in the 100 free, finishing with _

a season—best time of 46.07.

. Christoph Berger also ﬁnished with an
ECAC Championship medal. The junior
swam the 200 back with a time of 1:53.88

to take seventh place. "

Sarah Looney, the only member of the
women’s swimming and diving team com-
peting in the ﬁnals, swam in the consola-
tion ﬁnal for the 100 free. Looney, a senior,

ﬁnished 16th overall with a season—best

time of 53.22. .
The Panthers will now wait for NCAA

berths. Diving zones take place March -

11-13 in Annapolis, Md. Women’s NCAA

swimming begins March 17 in Austin, Tex- .

as, whereas men’s NCAA swimming takes
place in Minneapolis on March 24.

the back-alnd-forth second half with a
3—pointer and several layups over Cole.

Scanlon had nine points at—intermission -

and Villanova tied the game at 25 with
a 3-point play from Laura Sweeney 15
seconds into the second half.

Pitt didn’t score in the ﬁrst half ’s last

“_‘We’ve struggled a little bit with scor-

The Panthers also honored Selena
Nwude and senior manager Mary Jo

Winters in the pre-game senior day cer— '

emony. Nwude, formerly a forward for
the Panthers, had her career cut short
by injury. _

‘Sweeney’ ﬁnished with team—high 15

six rebounds. Eight different Wildcats

bench went scoreless.

Top 10 4 11

7. Best Supporting Actor — Travon
Woodall. Woodall always provides solid
depth at the guard position for the Pan-
thers, but he was truly tested for the first
time two weeks ago when starting point
guard Ashton Gibbs went down with an
MCL injury. _

Woodall ﬁlled in for the Panthers on
the road at West Virginia and at Villanova.
Pitt won both games, thanks in part to
Woodall’s sturdy presence at the top of
the key. ,

6. Best Comedy —— DePaul. Sure, it’s
acomedy of errors, but those are the best
kind. You can’t help but feel sorry for De-
Paul. It hasn’t had a winning record in the
Big East since the Lincoln administra-
tion. It was about to upset Villanova last
weekend, and all it needed to do was stop
the Wildcats from scoring in the last few
seconds. It failed, and Villanova won in
overtime.

5. Best Visual Effects — Oregon. Since
Nike’s founder, Philip. Knight, is an Oregon
alum, he basically hooks up the Ducks
with all kinds of free goodies. When the
Ducks opened their new basketball arena
last month, its court design wowed the
whole country. Green trees line the entire
court, so it looks as if one is standing in
the woods while looking at the floor. The
only thing better than the court itself were
the crazy visual effects of the grand open-
ing ceremony —— it rivaled the.opening
ceremonies at Beijing.

4. Best Drama — Michigan State. The
Spartans were also a nominee in the “Best
Comedy” category, but it appears they will
likely earn an NCAA Tournament berth.
Michigan State started the year ranked
in the top 5, but it quickly fell out of the
rankings. Now the Spartans are 16-12 and
8-8 in the Big Ten.

Every time it looks like Michigan State
is down for the count, it comes out and
gets a big win. I wouldn’t be surprised if
head coach Tom Izzo leads the Spartans
on a run in the Tournament.

3. Best Directing — Steve Lavin. The
St.]ohn’s head coach turned a once—proud,
but woeful-as—of-late, Red Storm program
back into a contender. St. John’s used to
be the epitome of the Big East — it is a
founding member and it plays at Madison
Square Garden, the Mecca of basketball.
Thanks to Lavin, the Red Storm are about
to make it to the NCAA Tournament again,
and they might even grab a high seed.

2. Best Picture — St.]ohn’s. Like al-
ways, the “Best Picture” award goes to
the same story that won “Best»Directing.”
St. John’s season is just too magical to
overlook.

V The Red Storm were hypedup at the
beginning of the year, then they quickly
flopped against St. Mary’s, St. Bonaventure
and Fordham. Fast~forward a few months,

[DePaul] hasn’t had
a Winning record

in the Big East
since the Lincoln
administration.

and they have wins against Duke, Pitt,
Connecticut and Villanova. It also looks
like they will have a double—bye in the
Big East tournament —— which is played
at Madison Square Garden. _

1. Best Music — Purdue’s student sec-
tion. Earlier in the year, Ohio State’s Jared
Sullinger recorded an incredibly awful ver-
sion of Miley Cyrus’s “Party in the USA.”
The painful rendition quickly became a
viral video, and when the Buckeyes vis-

ited the Boilermakers, the student section
known as the Paint Crew performed per~
haps the best insult in college basketball
history. Every single student in attendance
sang “Party in the USA” and danced while
Sullinger shot free throws. He made both
shots, but Purdue won-the game.

There you go, I hope the NCAA Oscars
were a success. Maybe next year we can
have a red carpet and have Joan Rivers
mindlessly blab about fashion. I
