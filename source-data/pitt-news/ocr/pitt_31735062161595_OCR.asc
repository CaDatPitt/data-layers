Chorus Boy .TelIs What
Goes On Backstage

At Cap, Gown Show

By GEORGE HYDE
Chorus Boy

If all the Words that have
been Written about the glamour
of life backstage were piled on
top of each other, they would
probably reach ten times higher
than the Cathedral.

Anyhow, I’ll add a few thoughts
and impressions on life on stage
and off during a performance of
“Pickets, Please!” from the vant-
age of a chorus boy.

A chorus member’s ﬁrst chore
is to have make-up put on by a
member of the staff. “Girls” are
made up to look as feminine as
possible, but the rouge, powder,
and pink base don’t always con-
ceal a heavy beard.

First Curtain

Next the search for costumes
begins. The boys run around the
dressing rooms searching for pant-
ies, garter belts, brassieres, wigs,
and etc. As Director Kelly says,
“Think of the fun you’re having.”

Overture! First curtain! The
show is on. The boys sound out
the mood of the audience. A re-
sponsive audience means a smooth
performance. Then a quick
change. Buttons won’t button.
Fingers fumble . . Hitler and
Mussolini masks adjusted and
there’s the cue for the Dictator
Shag number.

Underneath the masks it’s hot
and stuffy. You can’t see, but on
with dance. Fullerton and Cav-
alier swing their green chiffon

gowns and truck on down. En-
core.

International Spies . . . a
tricky change on stage. A black

moment when you forget your
next step, and remember just in

time. Wonder how Kelly keeps so V

cool? Get set for the fall .
and another number is over.
Waltz to the lilting strains of
“Julianne.” The audience ap-
preciates the grace and lightness
which the “girls” display. Boys
wear their best looking costume-—
dashing, white military uniforms.

Second Act
War!!! Baker dies for Cap and
Gown. Intermission the

boys sneak a cigarette.

Sweating stage hands and mov-
ing scenery are dodged . . the
chorus goes into the most beauti-

ful number in the show . . . the
Peasant Maypole dance. The ju-
bilant peasants shout “Hoya,

Hoya,” and drown out the orches-
tra . . garlands light up, and
the number receives the heaviest
applause of the evening.
Another quick change and into
the “I’m No Dummy” routine
. . The huge dolls take a beat-
ing and the number gets an en-
core. Precision Kick by the “show
girls” of the ensemble. Tuesday
night and the unexpected happen-

ed. The audience demanded an.

encore. The number was anything
but precision-like, but the audi-
ence loved it.

Finale . . the show is over

. somebody else’s cold cream‘

is “borrowed” and the struggle is
on to remove makeup. ,

Resident Coed

House Officers

Candidates for offices in the or-
ganization of coeds living at wo-
men's fraternity houses have been

QUANTUM THEORY

In 1925, nine years before be-
coming assistant director for
Westinghouse for a program of
fundamental research, Dr. Con-
don with R. W. Gurney developed
the modern quantum theory of
radio—activity which underlies
much of the modern work in nu-
clear physics.

He was graduated from the
University of California in 1924
and received his Ph.D. in physics
two years later. The ﬁrst year
after his doctorate studies he
specialized in theoretical physics
and modern quantum mechanics
under a National Research fellow-
ship in Germany.

He lectured in physics at C0-
lumbia university for a year, and
in 1928 became assistant professor
at Princeton university. A year
later he received a full professor-
ship at the University of Minne-
sota. L

WORTHING CHAIRMAN

He returned to Princeton and
stayed until his appointment at
Westinghouse. He is a member
of Phi Beta Kappa scholastic fra-
ternity, and in 1937 was appointed
chairman of the commission of
the College Entrance Examination
Board to study curriculum of high
school physics and chemistry.

Immediately following the ban-
quet, at which Dr. A. G. Worth-
ing, professor

Strength’ Tests
Begin Monday

By MELVIN ROGOW

With a11 unprecedented num-
ber of students taking Tuber-
culin tests VVednesday, The
Pitt News-Student Health
service campaign to seek out
Tuberculosis among students,
reached and passed the an-
nounced goal of 2,000 Tubercu-

A total of 2,139 students, in-
cluding 1,628 men and 511 wo-
men, took the tests during the
three weeks they were offered.

TESTS SHOW’ POSITIVE '
That this test was a more valu-
able one to the student body than
the Wassermann syphilis detection
tests, may be seen in the number
of positive reactions which have

The Wassermann tests failed to
show a single positive, whereas

have already been taken of stu-
dents who reacted positively to
the Tuberculin test. Of these,
several active Tuberculosis cases
have been found, cases which can
and will be cured since they were
caught_ in time.

Complete figures will be made
public by the health services as
soon as all persons who have taken
the test have been examined.

SECOND TEST

The Tuberculin test is made up
of three separate parts. First, the
“first strength protein derivative”
must be administered. If this test
shows positive, it is advisable for
the person to take an X-ray.

If the test shows negative, the
second_step, the “second strength
protein derivativ_g,j£_ is applied. If
this test proves negative, the per-
son taking the test may have full
assurance that he has no Tubercu-

If the second strength test re-
acts positively, the third step, an
X-ray, is advised by the doctor.
The chest X-ray is fool-proof, and
when read by as eminent a doctor
as Harold Brown., who has been
reading chest X-rays for some 20
years, they may be considered the

Psychologist Speaks

To Honor

Dean Of Women °
Acts As Hostess
To Honor Group

“Problems of the Exception-
ally Able Student” were out-
lined and discussed by Dr. Flor-
ence 'l‘eaga.rden, professor of
psychology, at the tea. given by
Miss Tliyrsa. Vt’. Amos, dean of
Wonien, Monday afternoon. The
tea honored 63 University
women who achieved a 2.5, or
above, average this past semester.

Dr. Teagarden presented the
differing factors of the excep-
tional student. “As a general rule,
according to studies made, health,
care for dress and grooming,
physical looks are all superior in
the exceptional student,” stated
Dr. Teagarden.

JUDGE OWN ABILITIES

“These students,” continued Dr.
Teagarden, “more than any other
types of students, are fair judges
of their own abilities. Yet at
times when the exceptional stu-
dent rates himself, he tends to un-
derestimate his achievements. In
the matter of intelligence and in-
itiative the exceptional student
differs from the average.”

“The most important factor in
rating people is to distinguish be-
tween the extraordinary and the
essentially great person,” contin-
ued Dr. Teagarden. “The chief
difference lies in the objects of
interest and affections. There is
that ﬁneness in sensitivity that
makes the essentially great per-
son respond to the dignity and
worth of objects.

EXPECT SUCCESS

“If the student has a delicacy
of feeling and respect for his fel-
low student, faculty and adminis-
tration,” added Dr. Teagarden,
he has gained a step in the direc-
tion of greatness.

“What should a University ex-
pect from the exceptional stu-
dent?” was asked Dr. Teagarden.
Speaking to the 63 women stu-
dents, Dr. Teagarden said, “I
think we have the right to expect
that you will make high intellect-
ual attainments outside the walls
of the class room—in society—in

the world at large.”

THE PITT NEWS

Cathedral Warmed By Complex
Three-Way Heating System

Belleﬁeld Power Plant’

Pipes Steam Supply
For University Rooms

By SAM ROSENBERG

The average student circling
through the revolving doors pro-
bably does not realize that he is
indirectly controlling the complex
heating_system of the Cathedral.

There are three separate units
that are involved in the heating
plant of the building.

The ﬁrst is a unit that provides
the heat at each entrance. Auto-
matically and individually the
controls for each entrance main-
tain a constant temperature.

AUTOMATIC CONTROLS

Automatic controls are the solu-
tion to the problem of irregular
traﬂic throughout the day. When
there is a great leakage of heat
because of a traﬁic rush the con-
trols send out a compensating ﬂow
of heat. At lull hours they act as
a check valve on the heat wave.”

The second unit is a hot water
system that heats the first four
ﬂoors. Above the fourth ﬂoor the
third unit sends steam to the top
of the Cathedral.

The source of the supply of
stearr» is the Belleﬁeld Power

Plant located at the rear of Car-
negie Library. This plant also fur-
nishes steam to the Mellon Insti-
tute and the Carnegie Library and
Museum.

Two mains, respectively, eight
and 12 inches in diameter run un-
derground beneath the Carnegie
Museum and Forbes street, up
Bellefield avenue to a point where
they make “Y’s” to the Cathedral
and the Mellon Institute. Through

these mains the steam rushes at .

one hundred and
pound pressure.
PRESSURE REDUCED

At the Cathedral, converters re-
duce the pressure down to three
pounds per square inch. It is un-
der this pressure that the upper
stories are heated. Because of
condensation, in the process of re-

seventy-five

ducing the pressure, the resultant ,

hot water utilized in the hot Water
system of the ﬁrst four floors. This
promotes great efficiency in the
system.

Ordinarily the eight inch main
brings a suﬂicient amount of
steam, but in severe weather a
switch is made to the twelve inch
main. Pittsburgh has never been
so cold that it was necessary to
really, with both mains, turn on
the heat; but we are prepared.

“How about it, Joe, do you
find that Camels are differ-
ent from other cigarettes?"

“Any all-cigarettes-are-alike talk doesn't jibe with
my experience.There’s a big difference. I"ve smoked
Camels steadily for 5 years, and found that Camel
is the cigarette that agrees with me, in a lot of ways.
Good taste. Mildness. Easy on the throat. And
Camels don't give me jumpy nerves. Like a lot of
people I know, 'I’d walk a mile for a Camel!”

BILL GRAHAM, seeing Joe DiMaggio pull out Camels, asked his opinion on smoking.
Joe answered: “There’s a big difference between Camels and others.” You, too, will find
in Camels a matchless blend of ﬁner, more expensive tobaccos —-Turkish and Domestic.

“TOBACCO
GROWERS FAVOR
CAMELS FOR
THEIR SMOKING!”

— is the majority
opinion in a survey of
successful, well-known

tobacco planters

“When Camel says
‘costlier tobaccos’ I
know it’s right,”
says Mr. Edward
Estes, capable
young planter, who
knows tobacco from -.
the ground up because he grows it.
“Take my last crop, for instance.
Camel bought all the best parts —
paid me the most I’ve ever gotten.
The men who grow tobacco know
What to smoke—Camels!” .

 

“Last year I had
the dandiest crop
ever,” says Mr.
Roy Jones, another
experienced planter
who prefers Cam-
els. “I smoke Cam-
els because I know they bid higher
and pay more at the auctions for
the choice lots of leaf tobacco. They
paid the highest price I ever got
from anybody. Considering that
Camel uses ﬁner, costlier tobaccos,
it’s not surprising that Camel is the
leading cigarette with us planters.”

 

M r . H a r o I (1
Craig, too, bases
his preference
for Camels on
what he knows
about the kinds
of tobaccos that  - 
go into the various cigarettes. “l get
the check-—so I know that Camels
use more expensive tobaccos. Camel

      

‘got the best of my last crop. That

holds true with most planters I
know, too. You bet I smoke Camels."

Correcting A Mal-impression

About Our Football Players
By Leonard Levison

Sports Editor

In lieu of the fact that the harangue of the varsity football
team in these columns earlier in the week by our gridiron critic,
Mr. Kal Kalwary, “as he is called by his friends,” was counter-
attacked by a similar harangue of the News commentator, an

editorial explanation of the situa-9

tion is in order.
=¥ =3 =3

Let it first be understood that
our reviewer was misunderstood,
a dilemma that confronts news-
writers quite frequently. The
point of misinterpretation was
concerned with various illustra-
tions he made to connote his cen-
tral theme. That those points
were in some instances, somewhat
exaggerated, we shall not quib-

ble.
at

No Comebac

But, about the main theme there
is no rebuttal. From the appear-
ance of things upon the practice
hill these days, the “prospects for
1938 are not bright” as was stated.

=l< =l<

The reason for this condition,
however, should be clarified. It
is not because of a lackadaisical
attitude on the part of the candi-
dates, not because they aren’t try-
ing as they should. But, simply
because there is a paucity of avail-
able material.

11¢

It is accurate to say that at vari-
ous times the experienced players
do let up in the vigorousness of
their drilling. But, while this is
not altogether condonable, it is an
attitude that has existed in spring
training at every college practice
field in the country. And an at-
titude that has been characteristic
of the seniors on Pitt football
squads of the past.

* *

Motion By Vote

These April drills consist chief-
ly of fundamentals and it is rath-
er difficult to expect a man who
has played varsity ball for two
years and who knows those fun-
damentals by rote, who has gone
over them for three years to en-
ter into them with a fresh enthusi-
asm.

Nevertheless the point that was

intended to be emphasized in the

previous review was that there
should be more wholehearted par-
ticipation in the present practices
because of the abbreviation of fall
sessions. But, it has been brought
to the attention of the critic that
the Faculty Committee has extend-
ed the length of drills this year
by five days so that should help

matters.

* =!= 3%

Fast Baclzﬁel

Returning to the primary allega-
tion, it should be reiterated.
Things don’t look so good for the
1938 Panthers. It is true that the
backfield is the “fastest in Pitt
history” and probably one of the
best. Also there are several All-
American possibilities on the line,
namely Bill Daddio and Al Le-

zouski.

Also Bob Dannies has been com-
ing along at center. Backing up
the line is his particular excel-
lence, and he has improved his
passing. He still needs to get
down the field more rapidly and
to pick up on his blocking. He
is playing the best ball he has
lever shown, and will be the cen-
ter.

Reserves Lacking

But the flagrant weaknesses are
at the tackles and in the matter
of reserves. Only the guards and
quarterback post seem well forti-
fied. Kish is on the way to tak-
ing that signal-calling post away
from Chickerneo. Emil Naric at
fullback is similarly doing quite
well.

3!: 

If Hafer and Merkovsky can
handle the tackle posts efficient-
ly, which hasn’t been indicated
yet, and if Pitt can escape injur-
ies throughout the season, a vir-
tual impossibility, and if a few of
the boys can do sixty-minute ser-
vice, asking almost too much, then
everything may be all right.

Floor Coaches Approve New Ruling

Convention

By S. S. KALWARY

At the ﬁfteenth annual convention of basketball coaches, at
the Hotel Morrison, Chicago, April Fool weekend, it was re-
vealed that there were no unusual physical results to the court-
men because of the elimination of the center jump. The center-
tap after every score was voted out last year and was a subject

of much discussion during the re-9

cent ﬂoor season.

Dr. H. Clifford Carlson, head
basketball coach and director of
the University health division, who
served as president of the coaches
association in 1936 and as a mem-
ber of the board of directors in
1937, resigned his post.

CARLSON OVER-RULED

Again Dr. Carlson, from the
door of the convention, suggested
that the basketball master-minds
discuss the improvement of ex-
cessive defensive blocking (for the
tenth successive year), but the
coaches were unwilling to consid-
er anything but time—out, foul-line
and no-off-times-out rules.

The ﬂoor mentors unanimously
votzed to free the foul circle, and
permit a player to hold the ball
three seconds inside of the foul
mark . . the ten-seconds rule
was again accepted . . . blocking
and screening rules remained un-
changed . . the time for time-

57, and for 1938, 59. Average
number of shots attempted, 92, in
1937, and 95 in 1938. The average
increase of actual playing time,
due to the new regulations, per
game, was only two and a half

By BILL McELWAIN

W'ith today the last day for
eiitrants to sign up, Harvey
Rooker’s big intra-miiral swim-
ming meet begins Monday even-
ing at 7 o’clock. If possible,
all events will be run-off Mon-
day. Otherwise, the ﬁnals will
be carried over to Tuesday at the
same hour.

The meet is developing into a
big success. Thirteen fraternities

are entering teams in competition
for the 24-inch trophy. The tro-

bronze ﬁgure of a swimmer in
starting position.
TEAM UNNECESSARY

In addition, over 100 unattached
men are expected to be entered by
the end of today. Mr. Rooker
stresses the point that it is not
necessary to be on a team to enter
the meet. A boy may enter only
one event if he cares to.

Unattached swimmers will be

burgh gold and silver
charms for ﬁrst and second places.
Several non—fraternity groups are
competing for medals as teams.

There is no limit to the number
of entrants in each event, but each
contestant is limited to three
events. All contestants must be
bona ﬁde undergraduates, and
must comply the regular intra-
mural eligibility rules. Men who
have earned varsity numerals are
ineligible.

FULL EVENT LIST

The trophy competition will be
based on total points, with five
points being awarded for ﬁrst
place, three for second, and one
for third.

There is a full schedule of
events listed. The free style
dashes are to be 40 yards, 100
yards, and 220 yards. Breast
stroke and back stroke events at
40 yards and 100 yards in each
complete the dashes.

The relay events consist of a
free style race of 160 yards and a
medley of 120 yards.

Four dives, the front, back, front
jack, and back jack dives, are re-
quired. The contestant may se-
lect any other four dives to com-
plete his quota of eight. Dives
will be judged on the regular in-
ter-collegiate point basis.

All entrants must bring their
own towels and suits.

Greeks Begin

Ping pong will soon take over
where bowling leaves off. The 13
‘Greek social fraternities have re-
ceived notices from the Dean of
l\«ien’s oﬂice announcing the draw-

- ings and times the matches are to

take place.

A quick glance at the draw-
ings establishes Sigma Alpha Mu
and the Delts as the upper brack-
et favorite with Pi Lambda Phi
strong in the other division. The
dark horses in the upper and low-
er brackets will be Phi Epsilon

Spirit Remains

By JAMES J. DAILEY

Giving 7,000 Cleveland fans
a glimpse of Pitt ﬁght, the
Panthers last Tuesday lost the
second and ﬁnal game of the
Harris-Sutphin Trophy play-
offs, 2-0, making John Carroll
University winner of the Tro-
phy and Ohio-Pennsylvania inter-
collegiate league champions.

Pitt no sooner went on to the
ice of the Cleveland Arena before
they were scored upon. After
three minutes of the ﬁrst period
had passed, John Hoctor, Carroll
forward, took a pass from Eddie
Arsenault and after one shot re-
bounded off Ellis’ pads, sunk the
puck while Ellis was out of posi-
tion.

RYAN STILL LUCKY

Considering the misfortunes of
the last few days, and now this
quick goal, a team with less spirit

might have folded, but it was at .
lthis point that the Panthers began '
to ﬁght. Led by Dick Friday, the
improvised ﬁrst line slammed up
the ice and barely missed a score
when “Tate” Brittain back-handed
a ﬁerce shot at the hulking Ryan
who got down on his knees to
make the save.

Playing four men up the ice
with only one man on defense to
protect the goalie, Coach Schooley
. left it up to Ellis to furnish most
of the defense and Pitt’s goalie
didn’t let him down.

Pitt skirmished frequently in
Carroll territory, and with play
swinging back and forth, Ellis had
frequent opportunity to make al-
most impossible saves.

ARSENAULT SCORES

Late in the third period, Arsen-
ault took advantage of one of his
many opportunities by scoring in
the last four minutes of play. With
the entire Pitt team on John Car-
roll ice, Arsenault picked up a
loose puck and, after several feints
at Ellis, let it go and made it.

Coach Schooley now shot the
works. With the score 2-0 against
him and three minutes to play,
Schooley put six forwards, the
ﬁrst two lines, into the game and
withdrew Ellis. ,

The six Panthers swarmed into A
Carroll territory and had Goalie
Ryan sprawled all over the ice in

The game ended immediately
after and the crowd cheered Pitt’s

and without their coach, the
Panthers deserved every tribute.

Outstanding for Pitt were all the
players who took the bumps dur-
ing the season and didn’t get the
credit—-the defense men and shock
troops. Fellows like Paul Ken-
nedy, a senior, who covered him-
self with glory in his last game,
and Clyde Shiring, playing in his
third hockey game, and Pat Cu-

played their hearts out. Bob

Life Lines
Out Of Time Style

INTERESTING was Life magazine’s a.rticle
last week concerning the ravages of Presi-
dent Rooseveltr’s depression, so-called. Writ-
ten around one Robert Simpson, unemployed
Detroit assembly-beltman, Life reveals how one
sturdy survivor of President Hoover ’s depres-
sion, so-called, ﬁnally loses his grip 011 life, for-
gets pride, applies for relief.

In customary short, succinct Timestyle, Life
takes no more than the usual slap at present
Democratic policy. Excepting Philadelphia's
Record and a dwindling few others, every big
newspaper has snapped up the same opportu-
nity to ascribe complete and unequivocal blame
for depression upon the head of President
Roosevelt’.

No defender of Roosevelt, per Se, we are dis-
turbed at injustice of identifying any depres-
sion with the party or person in power when
the depression occurs.

Until cooler heads arise with blueprints for
a planned economy, depressions, we believe,
will remain a part of capitalism. Rather should
recovery periods be ascribed to those who in-
duce them, while, until depression-agents lose
their anonymity those places of honor be left
blank.

No more, perhaps less, is Roosevelt respon-
sible for present downtrend than was pudgy
engineer Hoover in 1930. Obvious indeed is
the fact that a depression exists. Not obvious
at all are the economic, political, social, int'er-
national causes. Let Life’s shallow-thinking
caption-writer take heed, think.

The Illogical Logic

Of Armaments

Excerpt from a United Press dispatch from
VVasl1ington, April 6:

“With the tramp of thousands of soldiers’
feet and the rumble of steel war machines
echoing under the Capitol dome as the army
marched in a. huge Army Day parade, the’
Senate placed its final stamp of approval on
a. measure calculated to aid the United
States in the world race for armed suprem-
acy.

“Meanwhile, Chairman David I. Walsh,
Democrat, Massachusetts, of the Senate na-
val affairs committee, sped preparations to
./bring {President Roosevd1t’s $1,121,000,000
navy expansion program before the Senate
as soon as possible. This measure, authoriz-
ing contsruction of the most powerful super-
warships ever built, is designed to give the
United States a ﬂeet capable of defeating
any possible combination of enemies.”

The ways of peace, we admit, are strange,

and the strangest of these ways is the building
of huge armies and navies.

Stop This Hoax!

Instruct Congressmen
By Wire Or Letter

The government reorganization bill which
would authorize the President to reorganize
the executive and departmental structure of
federal government is before the House of”
Representatives for action. ‘ I

The bill does not impose autocratic pow-
ers in the President, nor does it virtually
create a dictatorship.

It (lees not radically change our form of
constitutional and representative govern-
ment, nor does it mean anything like the
death of American democracy.

It should be passed.

Telegraph or wire your congressman in
the House of Representatives IMMEDIATE-
LY, telling him to vote FOR the reorganiza-
tion bill, which has been so extremely mis-
represented that its true and sole purpose is
known only to students of government.

B right .

more and more towards idealistic and realistic
treatments of United States history, a discussion of
Boomtown is scarcely out of place.

Boomtown is the story of the development of a
silver town as seen through the eyes of Smiling
Frank O’Reilly, the discoverer of the tremendously
rich silver lode around which the town mush-
roomed.

Characters Are Typed

Jack O’Connor treats the rise and fall of this
town no differently than it has been treated before.
There is the usual inﬂux of money-mad miners,
The
town booms as long as the silver lasts, fades, and

gamblers, prostitutes, tinhorns, and crooks.

dies, and only a few battered die-hards remain to
talk of Silvertown in the ‘good old days.’

The characters in Boomtown are as typed as the
development of the theme. Smiling Frank O’Reilly
is the wild and woolly hero who can out-ﬁght, out-
cuss, out-drink, and out—love any tin-horn in Sil-
vertown. He is not only the rough-and-ready ﬁght-
er; he is a philosopher, a seeker after the good life.
This gives a certain Byronic touch ‘to O’Reilly that
the author evidently hoped would lift the character
above typed mediocrity. It doesn’t.

Not Pornographic

The only really satisfactory characters in Boom-
town are the prostitutes. I am not attempting to
shock any one in saying this. They are the only
characters whom the author allows to live and act
like people rather than types. Opal’s views on the
vagaries of her profession are far more refreshing
than the philosophical twaddle of O’Reilly.

We see and hear a good deal of Opal and her
professional sisters, for O’Connor, in the best pro-
letarian tradition, has Opal tell part of the story.
Understand, Boomtown is not pornographic; O’Con-
nor has merely chosen to write in the realistic pro-
letarian manner which has been so much in vogue
since the popularity of John Steinbeck’s Of Mice
and Men. .

If Boomtown isn’t a good novel, it is, at least, :1
good story. It’s quite readable, and it is a lot of
fun. Read it for Opal if for nothing else. And by
the way, the book is not on the library shelves. It
has been relegated to one of the darkest corners of
the vault and will not be widely circulated.

of Welfare.

Are these reforms necessary?
At present, the members of the
scores of quasi-legislative and
judicial boards are appointed for
lengthy terms, and are then re-
sponsible to no one.

ONE MAN NEEDED

The Comptroller—General can
refuse to hand out money, even
on order of Congress, if he does
not think the appropriation is in
accordance with Congress’ consti-
tutional powers.

The policy to be followed in es-
tablishing civil service merit pro-
tection is usually established by
Congress. Only one man is need-
ed to carry out these orders._

This hysteria over executive
dictatorship is silly. The func-
tions of government are: (1) to
decide policy, and (2) to carry out
policy.

EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT

Congress decides on policy;
that process will still be “demo-
cratic” after the bill is passed.
This policy is then carried out by
the executive and the administra-
tion. The question of “democ-
racy” doesn’t even enter into this
function; either the policy is car-
ried out efficiently or it is not.

In short, those who do not wish
to have the Reorganization Bill
passed want to embarrass the ad-
ministration, for one thing, but

This bill was drafted on the
basis of a report by the Brownlow
Commission, composed mainly of
college professors who certainly
would be the last ones to want to
bring repression upon themselves.

DICTATORSIIIP

We are developing a phobia
about dictatorship. In no coun-
try in the world has a
gained power over a nation by
the gradual encroachment of the
executive on the administrative
branches; dictatorship has come
as the result of a quick coup-
d’etat, then liquidation of the leg-
islature.

And such government has come
over people who have had a tra-
dition of hundreds of years of
goose-stepping and knee-scraping
to authority.

That’s why I echo the words of
one University political science
professor: “If you oppose this bill,
you are either stupid or vicious,

or both.”

publication, he was a huge suc-
cess. In addition to his normal
cut of the proﬁts, he managed to

make a tidy sum selling and
otherwise manipulating “due
bills” for Philadelphia hotels,

and with a great deal of sagacity,
he uncovered a great number of
events for which he could submit
expense accounts.

SUCCESS STORY

In addition, he was steward of
his fraternity, and collected all
sorts of fancy premiums which
food companies are prone to offer
to prospective customers. Of
course he was slipped anywhere
from ﬁve to ten “comps” for
school dances, tickets which he
found amazingly negotiable.

On top of that, he was chief

distributer for several cigarette
ﬁrms and campus advertising
agency for all sorts of strange,

but lucrative enterprises.

ACE GETS TRUMPED

In short, Horace (“Ace” was his
campus nickname) became one
ofthe biggest and most inﬂuential
men ever to graduate from Penn
State, a genuine BMOC.

Let’s take a look at Ace now.
Just recently he was convicted on
ﬁve counts for embezzling his
boss’ ready cash and using his
ﬁrm’s name to personal advant-
age. Just another case of college
experience carried into the world
beyond. And they say that the
experience we get in handling
people and making friends is per-
haps as valuable as anything we
acquire in the classroom.

This little fable (at least we
think it’s a fable) probable has
no counterpart at the University.
Anyway, it’s a nice thing to re-
member. And it nicely introduces
the subject of: “After school poli-
tics, what?”

LOCAL ‘BOYS’

Thus far, our political system
hasn’t created a single embezzler,
at least none whose machinations
have caught the public eye. But
some of the “boys” seem to be do-
ing well.

Bill McQuade, top engineer
through 1935-37, is using that
winning political smile to some
advantage as a sales engineer.

Hubie Teitelbaum, Phi Ep boss
for two years, and famed as “the
man who never backed a winner,”
is putting political wiles to good
use as an ace Pitt freshman law
student.

Chuck Herald, Independent
stalwart 1934-36, learned enough
from student politics to keep him
in Harvard Law School—up to
now.

D. C. Schultz is still in school.
(We mention him because his_po-

litical experiences seem, to’ ‘be

As business manager of a¢

over, to put it lightly.)

Ed Durkin, ex—Kappa Sig, who
knew as much as anyone as to
what goes on in dance budgets
and various other important
places, is now seriously studying
economics under the Capitol’s
shadow.

Ernie Rose said Wednesday
that “Experience” is the most im-
portant, in fact the only talking
point for student politics and stu-
dent government. As far as we
can see, he’s right.

EDITOR, THE PITT NEWS:

Although two cheap rags is-

National Inter-Collegiate Small
Bore Match held in Washington,
D. C. April 1, in which nearly
fourty-ﬁve teams all over the

MIGHTY PITT NEWS, no doubt,
had not a line to spare to men-

however, although not having any
connection with the University
just HAD to use up space so spent

It may interest you that this
insigniﬁcent paper has a circula-
tion rumored to be larger than
that of the PITT NEWS and also
that there are more readers of
their paper who don’t give a
