Traces School History

Tracing the development of the
University from the time of its 111-

ce-ption in 1787, when the -band of 13OI

pioneer families "who had come to
the edge of the world to stay,” 1'lI'Sl',

perceive-d the value of a LllllTyll’l'g‘ ideal,
.and—-“for practical reasons, just asI
they planted corn”——started tlhe Pitt-s—I
‘burgh Academy, ‘Chancellor John G.

_ , . . . I
Bo-wman, in his biennial report to theI

Board of Trustees, Tuesday night-
urged a reconsideration of the Uni-I
versity as a “prini.ary object” in gov-I
ernment and the creation of a new;
“organic oneness, a Pi-l'.ts'burgh wayI
of t'liinkinIg.” ,i

His review of the University’s evo-!
lution in the past 145 years translated 
into words the inspiration _ t;hat_I
brought about that early .gathering_ of I
“bewildered, yet hopeful, G~od~.:tearingi

’men.» and women,” they wh-0..-met and!

I

planned Pittsburgh’s first common cul-
tural proje-ct——the walniit-shingle-d log
sch-ool that later was dedicated Pitts-I
burgh Academy.

The University’s i-mportance as aI
cultural factor in the develop-ment 0-fI
Pittsburgh he stressed, c_h.ar.ging_ t_heI
men who today control its destmiesf
with being “solely responsible for itsI
policy.” And he visioned. our present;
state as one of uncertainty, one mi
which the necessity of ‘_‘t1‘y1n»g‘ to
realize the full richness of_the com’-I
mon life by living it more intensely I
is paramount.

From early records -of the _old A_ca.d-I
emy and his own interpretation of theI
pioneer day, D1-, Bowman re-c‘onst_r_uct—I
ed a picture -of life in early .t’1tl'«S-I
burgh,,when settlers’ children werel
“growing up and growing -wild, l1keI
quail in the wheat aebove -S-mi-thﬁeldI
street.” _ |

The Pioneer Intensity _

“People were so much sim.pler in
1787 than in 1982,” he said, “that we
can not now easily see_thi_'o-u'gjh the”:
eyes nor think in their fashions Oi
thought.” “The range of their think-
ing was, no doubt, narrow; bill}. I be’
lieve, their thought was more intense
within their range and more ori-ginal,
and they cared -more profoundly about
their convictions.” _ _ _

Fr-om this :back-g1‘_01§lnd Of SP11'1l3u'3l1'tY
and “intensity of living” evolved that
kind of government called democracy,
a partnership with God for the right
use and governme—nt_»0‘i the new land.
Democracy, in their understanding,
“did not mean that a man C011ld do
as’ he wanted. It was, ~rathcI_',_ 3
splendid way of creating opportuniti_es
for one another. It. Was, he 531d»
“the extension of their.bes»t.cha1'aC_’CeI‘

Industry and Growth

“Smokestacks rose along the I‘iV€1‘S-
mills appeared ‘and grew _big in the
triangle; the flail was lost in the hum-
ming of machines.” _He saw Pitts-
l)111‘_f<‘l‘l famous over night, with the
world asking for its products. few
more years and the mills needed men
from the outside world: “Italians,
Poles. Slovaks, Magyars, and others.”

But with the new industry came a
-change in interests. ‘The air became
charged with plans for getting rich.
The impelling interests _had moved
from patriotism and religion to agri-
culture and education. and then to in-
dustry and wealth. The thing to do
was to get rich.”

o’clock is counted upon to emu-

Ic-rn, followed by victories over VVest

Ioverrated Panthers slipped back a
Qfew notches in the national rankings
late its famous predecessors. May
the ﬁghting spirit aroused be as
devastating to the famed Notre
Dame team as that of the Eng-

lisli to their southern enemies!

Every student is asked to con-
tribute; every student who will
not wear a football uniform tomor-
row is asked to attend the rally,
forget his dignity and yell for
victory.  __

Preparatory to yelling and in-
cidentally to take the folds out of
lungs for the purpose, students
are asked to report to Betty Quar-
rie, chairman of the Assembly
Committee of Student Council, in
room 804, Cathedral of Learning,
at 2 o’clock this afternoon, to
gather wood for the bonﬁre.

R. O. T. C. headquarters has of-
fered to lend the committee the
army truck for use in gathering
fuel, but more could easily be
used. All loans of ﬁve-ton trucks,
even ﬂivve-rs, will be gratefully
accepted.

The band and R. O. T. C. will be
at the rally to add to the gala
spirit. The program lists James

experience. of work and of adventure
waspackeddown hard in them, keep-
ing ideals with.in.the bounds of sense,
stillthey valued lovelier things. They
had.come to the. edge of the world to
stay. There was no turning back.

'4-They had ambition, religion, and chil-

dren. Out of this combination, some
glimpse of civic greatness ahead was
as inevitable as themorning-. It came
and, in time,.fashioned.for them from
the substance of hope the city of
their desire: a great city called
Pittsburgh, in which their children,
if not themselves, were to grow to the
full elevation of their minds, to fol-
low their natural bents, and to pros-
per. The idea was practical enough
to make men leave the shingling of
their cabins until the shingles were
onuthe Academy.

This plan of 145 -years ago is now
so pertinent to the future usefulness
of the University of Pittsburgh that
it fairly demands review.

Those Pioneers Wanted a
Better Pittsburgh

Those pioneers—the Barrs, Rosses,
McMillans, and other le.ading Pitts-
bu.rghers—made the right start in
their project: they wanted a better
Pittsburgh. The wa.nt was the im-
portant thing. By February 28, 1787,
the wa-nt had produced a charter for
the Academy. The charter said:
“The education of youth is-aprimary
object with every government.” In
other words; the Academy was not an
end in itself ;.it was.not an ornament
or merely a social asset; it was “a
primary object.” The city of their
hone neededit.

But why, now, did the Barrs,
Rosses, McM-illans, and others lay
such store by the Academy? To an-
swer this question, it seems to me,
we must get their_ideas associated,
as they were then, with the smell of
oak chips and of newly split walnut
shingles about a log school. We
must live in imagination in that vil-
lage and be kept awake at night by
owls iwtbe woodsoutside and by the
fear'of~‘ Indians; feel our arms and
back ache with too much work; and
realize that the ﬁne things of life-
music, reading, science, poetry, and
leisure-——had been left east of the
mountains. If now we live in imag-
ination; in those days and share in
the ﬁrst common cultural project of
Pittsburgh, we touch inspiring his-
tory. No more signiﬁcant hour, I
like to think, is in Pittsbrgh-’s story
than -the dedication of a -log school
house called the -Pittsburgh Academy.
children Were to Study

Children-had been growing up and
growing wild, like quail in the wheat
above. Sm-ithﬁeld street. They might
become like Indians. But now, no,
they were to learn “the useful arts
a~nd.the sciences a.nd~literature.” The
charter tells us that." But the charter
does :not tell .all. If we had gone to
the dedication of the Academy, we
probably should have heard less
about the useful arts--and sciences and
literature than about the life abund-
ant. No record is left of that meet-
ing; and if the record were left, still
we could not get the fullimport of
what those folk wanted to say, for
when the heart is-full and the aim
high,-what a.man would say is in his
voice and his way of telling.

What we do know about the occa-
sion is that, with little doubt, the
Pittsburgh families with these names
were present: Barr, Findley, Pow-
ers, McMillan, Smith, Henderson,
Gibson, Neville, Butler, Bayard, Ross,
Bradford, Galbraith, Thompson,
Walker, Poole, Moore, Todd, Fowler,
Bedford. and‘P.arker. The heads of
these families were the ﬁrst trustees.
In. addition to these folk were prob-
ably-.the-families with these names:
Robinson, Wilkins, Roberts, O'Hara,
Semple, Craig, Biddle, Willock, Rid-
dle, Wallace, Stevenson, Darragh,
Stockton. McNair, Brackenridge, Ir-
win, Sutton, McClintock, Kerr, Magee,
B_gggg,.,chu;:ch, .Denny, Collins, Jones,
Barker. Watson, and others. BOYS
from these: families were among the-
earlystudents of the Academy.

There was not much talk, I suspect,
at the meeting, but‘ such words as
were said; were direct and to the-

point. There weresilences, too,.I-like

to think, when the only motion in the
room was the ﬂickering of candles.
Tired men and women, bewildered.
yet hopeful, “their eyes turned earn-
estly on Heaven,” were gathered in a
sense of victory. Life more abundant
was on the way.

Villagers Expressed
Thankfulness

The meeting began with prayer.
Not much imagination is needed to
know that these villagers expressed
silent and individual thankfulness
during that prayer for fat iron tea-
kettles swung at their ﬁreplaces, for
turnips and ﬁsh and wild turkeys, for
iron ore in the hills and for coal, for
a trail through the woods that led to
the nearest post office at Shippens-
burg, for wheat and corn and cows
and sheep.

Life -was possible and would go on
Better than that, the glory of God and
what-life would be in Pittsburgh were
fused in their thinking. The frontier
touched « subliznity. Something might-
ier than their own wills had them.
They had met hardships‘, suffered.
worked, and won. ‘That was clear.
In the chopping of trees, however. for
their cabins or for the clearing of
ﬁeld-s or for boat-building, in the car-
rying of stones for their chimneys, in
ﬁghts with Indians. and in the hard
competition for a little money, they
had somewhat forgot about justice
a11d kindness andlife abundant. But
now in the candlelight they were un-
derstanding again. God was energy
and force, helping them‘with the long

.day’s wdrk. "He was intelligence and
understanding, too, wakening their
souls. ,

Listen again to names of folk who
were at that meeting: Barr, McMillan,
Henderson, Ross, Denny, Vvallace.
Wilkins, Walker. The names breathe,
or purr with r’s, a nationalism and o
sectarianism of a northern land. Al-
though it is true that there were Ger-
mans here, too, in those days. and
that they were building on ~VVoo(l
street, on a lot given them by the
Penns, the ﬁrst church of the village;
and although Jacob Bausman ran the
ferry, and Jacob Winebiddle was a
leading merchant, the town was
chieﬂ_y-“inhabited by Scots and Irish.’{

In this connection, it is interesting to
note that the Faculty of the University,

at the time of its reorganization in 1819,

consisted of Robert Bruce, John Black,

and E." P. Swift-, Presbyterian ministers;

Joseph -McEl1-oy, minister of the Associate

Reform Church: and Charles B. Maguirc,

Catholic priest. Records concerning the

teachers of the Academy were destroyed

byufire.
Presbyterians Were
In Prominence I

Most of the names of the people at
the meeting-are of Scots, wide—rangin2
Presbyterians, born into the stern
theology of John Knox, whose- sin-
cerity ha-d penetrated the cottages of
Scotland. They shud.dered in their
responsibility to God. In the drab
twilight of.-Scotland, they had learned
that some day God would ask, “What
have you done?” Here, at the edge
of the world,,—in a brighter twilight
some day they would answer, “We
are making a great and righteous
city.” ~ ,

There is sometliingabout a school
that is’-‘ sacred: a responsibility about
it so powerful that it makes strong
men grow and weak ones grow
afraid. These pioneers, as they sat
in the log school, were caught by
that vague something. They felt a
high sense of duty. Theyvwere seek-
ing God. In the search. they found
joy that could not be told. God was
a presence, and wisdom, and the pos-
sibility of life abundant. The Acad-
emy was fused into this mood and
thought. It was a means to life
abundant. It was a- symbol of wis-
dom and of spirituality.

People in Pittsburgh were so much
simpler in 1787 than in 1932.that we
can not now easily see through their
eyes nor think in their fashions of

thought. They had more of
the woods in them. They lived
more alone. They experienced
more of those lonely moments

in life when the stars blur and im-
prove one’s thinking. The range of
their thinking was, no doubt, narrow;
but, I believe, their thought was more
intense within their range and more
original, and they cared more pro-
foundly about their convictions;

The ﬁrst aim of the Academy, then,
was the good life—spirituality. Wis-
dom was a part of the good life: use-
ful arts, science, literature. But now,
while the land was God’s, it was also
theirs; theirs to clear into ﬁelds on
which to sow and to harvest, theirs
in which to dig for coal and iron and,
above all, theirs to govern. They
would have a kind of government
called Democracy which was new in
the world. In this very year, the
thirteen states had agreed upon a
constitution. Democracy was a part-
nership with: God for the right use and
government of the new land. The
new Academy should train men in

“Be Fair,” Game to Have I

Democracy, freedom, and libertyi

meaning, too serious to be sentimen-'

man could do as he wanted. It was,
rather, a splendid way of creating 013- :
portunities for one another. It was
the. extension of their best character
into law. It said: Believe in good.
Believe in justice, tolerance, and non-=

body else, and everybody is to be what
God intended him to be.

That was in 1787. Years went by
and the -community grew. It spread
out past Grant’s Hill and crossed a
river. At night, yellow windows glim-
mered on the hilltops. A road was
completed across the mountains. Over
it came thousands of covered wagons
drawn by horses or ox teams; 111911
and women came on foot—all intent
upon the free lands of Ohio, of In-
diana and of the unknown beyond.
They needed blankets, pots, crocks,
horseshoes, axes, guns. The towns-
folk were making these things. They
gave their names to new streets. They

built wharfs along the rivers. Pitts-
burgh was becoming a city. From
over the mountains came vague

stories of the second war with Eng-
Land. After a time the river brought
news of a Mexican war. Then came
the Civil I/Var. Part of the country
had forgotten about Democracy. That
was bad and should be stopped. By
1nd by, the country settled again to
peace. Meanwhile, Pittsburgh grew
still more and prospered.

Steam Brought a New

Era of Progress

Pittsburgh did not know, however,
chat the close of the Civil War had
‘irought with it a new force destined
:0» change. its character. Already
xteamb-oats were onthe rivers. VVe
were proud of that. Steam made men
able to do bigger things; with it they
could th-resh more grain, plant more
land, dig more coal, shape more steel.
it made men more productive.

Then came a new idea. For a long
period, people in Pittsburgh had been
pioneers. They had got used to the
daring spirit of that life. They had
been learning about industry. Here
was a new opportunity to carry on in
the old way. They would be frontiers-
men, not of the woods nor of the soil,
but of industry, steam-driven and of
proportions beyond all former think-
mg.

The new idea was turned to action.
Smokestacks rose along the -rivers;

triangle; the ﬂail was lost in the
Eiumming of machines. Farmers left
their farms to take part in the new
day. The outside world was asking
-for glass, coal and iron. Pittsburgh,
the pioneer of machine production,
wasfamous, just as things happen in
_a fairy story. . After a short time, men
were called from the outside world to
help: Italians, Poles, Slavs, Magyars
and others.

Times had changed. Pittsburghers
Eoundthat they no longer passed only
;heir neighbors on Smithﬁeld street.
There seemed to be no neighbors. It
was strange to -try to be friends with
hose new folk. But another change.
more subtle and more signiﬁcant, was
“oming on. The old life and the old
ideals were being submerged in the
vush for industry. Never before had
money been made with such speed.
There was coal to be taken from the
hills, steel mills to make and, after
that, the steel. There was pipe to
make; and.more glass than, it seemed,
the world could need; gas wells to
sink and gas to use; oil unlimited;
bricks and ropes and machines; and
machines to make more machines.

In this-outburst.of action, a man's
worth was measured by dollars. That
was new. To ‘make money was like
a game. The score was in do-llars.
Then the aim of life and a high score
tended to be the sametliing; and, un-
aware, on week days men found that

their primary hope was reachable
and obtainable. How strangely some-
thing had gone wrong! When hope

can be got down and touched and
held, it is-no longer hope.. When it
‘can be deﬁned in terms other than
human relationships, its loveliness
gets dull and its meaning lost.

Then, in 1929-

Came the Crash

In 1929 came the crash. It was a
large-sized crasl1—one that was more
than a slump in securities. It was a
slump, too, in self-conﬁdence. What
has happened?

Let us look back. A long path is
there. At the far end is the frontier
with its unbounded hope in govern-
ment. Loyalty to one’s duty as a -cit-
izen and belief in God were scarcely
separable. They were a measure of
a man’s worth. Not much else mat-
tered.

Then woods gave way slowly to
farming. A glad agricultural era
came on. The land was fertile. If
you wanted anything, all you had to do
was to plant a seed. ‘Life was get-
ting better. It would improve from
now on. The whole intellectual and
cultural heritage accumulated since
David’s time should be moved to
Western Pennsylvania farms, villages
and cities. That, now, was what mat-
tered. Emerson was only reflecting
a11 appraisal of his age when, in -.1832,

returning from a visit to Landor, Car-F

lyle, Coleridge and VVordsworth. hel
said, speaking of these men, “They
feel themselves to be so rich.’ 

What happened in 1929 seems‘,
plainer as we come toward that year.

John G. Bowman who

Chancellor
delivered his biennial

trustees, Tuesday evening,
meeting in the Duquesne Club.

The industrial age came in an order»;

Iy way. Its spirit was action, ro-
mance, adventure. We liked that. It
sent men's imaginations beyond their
accustomed limits. It added to.our
comforts; gave us better ho-uses, food,
1' o :1 cl s, transportation, hospitals,
schools, churches and museums. Med-
icine and science, both having direct
value to industry, especially pros-
pered. All of this was splendid. But
gradually, while men were not half
aware of the changes, their impelllng
Interests moved from patriotism and
religion to agriculture and education,
and then to industry and wealth. The
air became charged with plans for
gettiiig rich, The thing to do was to
get rich.

By “rich,” though, men did not
mean what Emerson had meant when
he wrote, “They feel themselves to
be so rich.” We know whathe meant;
but do we quite admit that a sensible
man would deﬁne riches as hunger
in the heart to possess one’s heritage?
When we hear,, as from another
world, of 3, man whose zest in life
seems to make the sunrise last for
him all day, do we count him rich?
it‘ you and I integrate ourselves
through our work, ﬁnding the width
and length of our personalities, are
we rich?

Ill

Here we are in 1932. Production is
still down. A sense of mistiness is in
the air. ‘We wonder what is to come.
Perhaps we are in a new era, in an
era when, as never before in history,
men will give less time to earning a
living or to the gathering of material
things, and more to trying to realize
the full richness of the common life
by living it more’int‘enselv.

New Era Relieved
Drudgery of Life

Such an era, in spite of its ﬂuctua-
tious, has been coming for a hundred
years. Machines, steam, electricity,
new processes and new applications
of science, in these years, have been
relieving the world of drudgery.
Through that fact, we have gained
time to think about what we are and
what we ought to be; and now, in
the present crisis, it maybe that we
are beginning to discover the widths
and breadths of our personalities. lt
maybe that we are getting so clear
a glimpse of the-life which individual-
ly and collectively we could live that
we should not be willing, if the op-
portunity comes, to return to the old
routine,

“But,” you ask, “what is this new
wayrof living? What will it do to
me?”

Part of the answer to-these ques-
‘.ions is easy, for we know, with a
slight reminder, what part of the
tiew way is. VVe know that we do
tot make shoes for ourselves or fam-
ilies; we do not render tallow and
make candles at home for light; or
spin yarn, or churn butter, or make
the baby’s crib—as the McMi1lans and
O’I—Iaras did. The day of such work
is gone. Diversiﬁed industry has taken
the load from us and we-have some
spare time, called leisure. -We know
this, but we forget. Once a tired-out
people of Europe expressed their
-ttommon hope in Gothic architecture.
They built cathedrals which still
atand and still record their impas-
sioned cry and demand for rest. They
wanted what we have: leisure.

Leisure, giving us opportunity to
choose a certain amount of work and
of play and of matters to think about,
allowing us to develop our personal-
ities. That is plain enough. But to
do this choosing so well that our lives
‘:-ecome rounded out, symmetrical and
whole is not easy. Personality is so
subtle and so complex that it can not
be measured or far explained. It sub-
mits to no formula. Some minds, for
example, seem to possess an eXtI‘em8
sensitivenes to truth. They sweep
past all reasoning‘ and arrive in a
flash at the solution of problems. For
such reasons, no one seems to be
wise enough to put up road-markers
for us, po-inting to the right use of
leisure.

Personality Seen in
Every Man’s Work

Let us try to ﬁnd our way along,
however, by putting personality into
a simple equation, like arithmetic. In
such an equation, personality would
be the sum of our native endowment
plus the sum of our experience, D1113
the values——sensations and imagin-
ings—we attach to both. A machinist.
for example, goes to work in the
morning at a lathe. He has Chosen
that work because by his n.ative en-
dowment he possesses manual dex-
terity and, therefore, ﬁnds lathe work
agreeable. But as he starts the lathe
and watches the steel curl away from
a. tool-steel edge; as he turns the
valve, let us say, of an oil pump ac-
curately to one ten-thousandth of an

inch; as, ﬁnally, he puts the parts of‘

the pump together into a perfect-
working whole——all that is experience.

 

It is part of his life and valuable. But
if now the machinist, with his endow-
gmeut of dexterity and with his ex-
; perience in making the o-il pump,
fstops short at this point, we say that
{he lacks personality. He is alive, but
:not vivid or unique, I/Ve say that he
;is merely 3, routine worker; and it is
;a fair assumption that he has never
Etouched great living.
Leisure Gave New
Opportunities

VVith some leisure in his day, then,
[this machinist has opportunity to be
[more than a routine worker. He has
.'time to think and to grow. The ex-
tent of his rising above an undis-
tinguished level will depend very
much upon the values which he at-
taches to his experiences within the
shop and out of it. He might, for ex-
ample,
pump and realize with a flush of pride
that it is a unit in the vast organiza-
tion of society through which we are
relieved of drudgery. Through his
'=work, more oil is available, and more
power, and, therefore, more freedom
to men. He might feel his heart beat
faster because he perceives that
' through his work the pleasure of run-
,ning an automobile is brought with-
gin the means of more people. Such
; interpretations of experience cause
i the personality of a man to grow.

eport to

look upon his completed oili

ocracy. It is itself a democracy.
man is to have a chance. The idea
is a vast and beautiful thing. We for-
get, however, that it is not bequeathed
to us to hold like a piece of land. It
exists only as we have intelligence
enough to understand it, to preserve
it, and by our thoughts and actions
further to perfect it. Democracy is
like an individual—-it grows. It grows
in men’s minds and has its being in
our institutions~—legislative- bodies,
courts, schools and hospitals.

Now a particular kind of mind is
needed for the ideal of democracy to
live in; an American kind of mind,
one that has an adequate understand-
ing of how the world has struggled
through thousands of years up to the
idea of se1f—discipline in an oppor-
tunity for self-development.
iVioI3nist Analogous
 To Pittsburghers
I Did‘ that machinist who made the
[violin have the sort of mind, or way
iof thinking, which Pittsburgh needs?
[Yes, in that he developed his person-
gality; no, in that he me-rely used the
Iprivileges of democracy without car-
irying his share of the responsibility.
;He was merely an individual isolated
fin a multitude rather than a citizen
fof Pittsburgh who felt responsible in
;his citizenship. He saw himself in

, And his pants——they are too small and
[too shabby. Dad and his boy go to

ithe lad in the long trousers, more
jlike a man than Dad ever
‘iis boy could be; and there is Dad
with some experience plus an inter-
pretation of that experience which he
tries to hide by turning away.
But Work Does Not
Satisfy Interest
Yet it may be that the machinist
does not get, day after day. in the
shop or out of it, the experience
zvhich vaguely he longs for. Interest
lrags. He takes an inventory of his
way of living. He puts down his work
as “not bad.” But it is not enough.
Tie comes to some spare hours in the
inventory. VVl1at is he doing with
them? What might he do with them?
He. is fond of music. He has always
ivanted to learn to play but has never
made the start. His mind clicks with
an idea. He go-es to the library and
gets a book on how to make a violin.
He reads about the great makers of
violins and about how they made
their instruments. He has 1necl1an—
lcal skill; he could make a ﬁddle; he
.could learn how to play!

Once I knew a skilled worker who
took stock of himself in just this way.
He spent his evenings for six months
in the making of a violin. He shaped

last tightened the strings over the
bridge. His hands trembled as he
picked the ﬁrst notes. Days went on.
He learned to play. At ﬁrst, his love
of the sweet sounds was interest
enough. Later game some mastery
of the bow and of the strings; and,
in time, as" he learned to feel the
meaning of the notes, came little mo-
mentary thrills, while the violin
seemed to play itself in his hands,
taking him over the housetops and
away to the glorious being of the man
he would mcstlike to be. After one
trip of that kind, he knew that great
playing is like prayer. It is for God.
Time and again he wondered, wak-
ened at night and wondered, how Bach
could have caught, and held long
enough to put down, whole pages of
his music. Why did not Bach’s heart,
he wondered, shatter-the man to death
at such a time? He knew no answer,
but he did know that as he himself
touched the edge of his own spiritual
limit, he was no longer closed round
by 3, world of things, to be touched,
or seen, or smelled; he was free——-
free in God's world to he himself.
Find New Expression

In Companionship

The machinist, then, worked in the
shop, made a companion of his boy,
played upon his violin, and listened,
like the rest -of us, to the crickets.
Those were the materials of his ex-
perience to which he attached sensa-
tions and imaginings; and, being
hopeful by native endowment as well
as being gifted with his hands, he
built with all his personality. He built
_a richer personality, obviously, be-
cause of the portion of his experience
"acquired through leisure.

VVell, we are already in an era with
more leisure in it than has appeared
before in history. But leisure, let us
not mistake, is not mere vacant time.
It is not empty playtime. It is not
laziness. Rather, to an intelligent
mind, leisure brings more work into
a day because it brings more incentive
to work. It is opportunity for growth.
It is the barest beginning, the basic
clement, by which we are privileged
to move into our true dwelling-places,
to discover our spiritual dimensions,
to enrich life with a vibrant signiﬁ-
cance not limited to our material sur-
roundings.

Pittsburgh today is a dynamic city.
It is ﬁnding itself. Much of it is ugly;
all of it is potentially beautiful with
-its hills, valleys and rivers, Along its
streets runs a full life of strong, peace-
ful affections. Among these people
are some 250,000 folk of non-English

eager than most of Pittsburgh knows!

ways, to love it. They are waiting.

University Is More
Than Just Buildings

VVe must not think of the Univer-
sity as a group of buildings where
‘toys and girls are taught how to earn
'lollars. The aim is scarcely to teach
at all; it is to inspire youth to walls‘
fn the newness of life toward Heaven‘.-
Gate. It is to open windows, reveal-
ing in the long reach back what men
have fought for and prayed for, and
what wealth lies yonder to round out.
lift up and perfect the personalities of
these boys and girls, touching them,
now, with the sublime simplicity with

Greeks or, again, with the pipe organ
music with which Milton made poetry.
Above all it is to waken in them a
profound loyalty to Pittsburgh and to
Pennsylvania and the urge to get wis-
dom and, as an inspiring privilege, to
use it in our civic problems.

In saying this, I am not unmindful
cf the value of facts and research. A
body of facts is essential to any ade-
quate career, in medicine, for exam-
ple. or law, or chemistry, or art. The
University is an opportunity to get a
factual foundation for a vocation.
Scholarship is important. It is as-
sumed always as the structure of any
course. Butover and above this is
the power to inspire and to impart to
students, primarily by inspiration.

as understanding of government and
,loyalty to it, good manners. ability to
make friends and to hold them, to‘

discern what is good, and to retain it.
If the universal needs, such as these,
can not be interpreted through the
subject matter of a course, the course
is not worth giving.

The Pittsburgh which I like to think
of is a democracy in fact. Its govern-
ment is the extension of the best in
us. Its citizens work. They earn a
living. They seize every opportunity
in work and in leisure to perfect their
personalities, sensitive always to the
well-being of our civic life.

Greater Pittsburgh Is
Just Yonder

We have, in all probability, as good
minds as men have ever had. We have
better health. We have leisure.
These are prerequisites for the rise
of the Great Pittsburgh, great both
in the material and in the spiritual
sense. Just yonder, if we really want
it, is that Pittsburgh. In that city,
the friction of kindred minds upon
one another would strike sparks and
flare into a new world heritage as we
learned to give adequate expression in
music, poetry, drama and painting to

the 20,000 alumni of the University.

“Pittsburgh,” -he declared, “is -part
of a great democracy. It is itself a

idea that every man is to have a

it is not bequeathed to us to hold like

The Chancellor's Report

NCE every two years Chancellor John G. Bowman, in a written
report to the Board of Trustees, explains the nature of the work
being done by the University, the extent of its development since the
time of the preceding report, and, on the basis of his expermce 1n
the administration of the policies laid down by the trustees, makes
certain recommendations for the improvement of the University 

an educational center.

That, structurally at least. is the content of the ‘biennial report.

The ﬁnancial report is handled elsewhere by recognized auditors
who make known their ﬁndings in a separate statement to the gov-
erning board. But, assuming its theoretical content, the Chancel-
lor’s report for 1932 is more than anything which we have said
would suggest. » = -
, Going far beyond its mark—~the comparatively small group of
trustees——the preface to the report is, in effect,  message to every
Pittsburgher; a message from one who, in the brief span of ten
years, has learned to understand the community perhaps better than
any of its life-long residents. It reaches out and touches every man,
woman and child who ever saw, or thought he saw, beauty in dismal,
cobbled streets and quiet furnaces beside a sluggish, muddled river.
It is an appeal for every Pittsburgher to take what is within his
grasp, and, in so doing, to make the University the “unifying ideal?’
in a return to the “full richness of the common life by living it
more intensely.” .

Because we believe Dr. Bowman’s report to be an honestly
beautiful piece of writing, the partial explanation of a philosophy of
living and an inspiration that many of us have failed to understand,
wehave presented the complete text of the preface to his biennial
report in this issue.

Vile know that it will be read by the “students” of the Univer-
sity, those for whom Pittsburgh Academy was founded. They will
make its publication worth while. As for the “registrants,” we can
only hope.

 

Tonight We Rally --- Maybe

ITH tomorrow ’s game in the Stadium the most outstanding and,

at the same time, the. most doubt.ful—on the University athletic
calendar, the pep rally scheduled to be held on Ruskin Field tonight
takes on an added signiﬁcance.

Confronted from the very start by the pessimism of a niajority
of Student Council members, the Assemblies committee under Betty
Quarriﬁe, Col. ’34, nevertheless has gone ahead with preparations for
the rally. Judging from the enthusiasm of her fellow-workers and
the splendid assistance given the project by the military and athletic

-departinents, one might venture the opinion that tonight, for the

first time in many seasons, Pitt is to have an outdoor meeting that
might be recognized as a “pep” rally.

The athletic department has consistently supported such meet-
ings in the past, coaches and players appearing time after time with
the University band, and being welcomed and “cheered to victory”
by an Assemblies committee and a group of curious studcnts—that
is, provided the weather was pleasant and the earnest children just
happened to be in Oakland for the evening.

' They have been pathetic affairs, these “pep’ assemblies. And
the responsibility for their failurcs——as in other student ﬁascos—
comes back with a saddening thump into the laps of some 7,000 stu-
dents. The interests of all of us, semi-mature beings that we are, seem
to have strayed from torch-light processions to tea dances. VVhen
we scarcely yell at the game itself, it does not follow that we should
getexcited over a “pep” rally. And, of course, we don’t.

.Tonight’s rally, however, has everything possible in its favor.
There is more interest over the Pitt-Notrc Dame game than there is
over the dances that will follow it. Effective publicity has brought
the rally to the attention of all the students. This, surely, is the
time to test the “pep” of the student body.

, If the rally on Ruskin Field is unattended tonight, there can be
no further reason why conscientious Council members should feel
compelled to “rally” around the body of a lifeless tradition, long
since destined for that. hill of stones above the Stadium.

On To Philadelphia

7

* ACH year the question, “How will I get to see that game?” is

asked among students bewailing their fate in their inability 
attend any off-campus football games. The cost is always the fore-
most consideration and its total cost, most times prohibitive, brings
its usual depression in feeling among those contemplating visitation
to other cities for a week-end.‘

The PITT NEWS believes that this year, in spite of tlie tight
ﬁnancial condition in which most students ﬁnd themselves, that this
problem, to a great extent, has been solved for those contemplating
the University of Pennsylvania-Pittsburgh football game, at Phila-
delphia, November 5. A The NEV-VS, in anticipation of the interest in
this ‘game has forsaken its purely journalistic pursuits to arrange
transportation at a cost that will not be found comparable anywhere.

, VVith the resumption of football relationships between these two
schools, one representing the east, the other the west part of the
state, Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania is planning
a huge welcome to celebrate this ending of a six-year lapse.

.'But Philadelphia and Penn can only extend a welcome. Pitts-
burgh and Pitt must make that welcome what it may be. And the
cost must be ruled out in this instance of any reason of non-attend-
ance; lack of spirit and interest in the student ’s alma mater is the
only reason left. A

Must it be said of the University of Pittsburgh, that there .is
no school spirit? No! It’s on to Philadelphia!

By Don Early

 

Tonight the Boston Symphony Or-
chestra under Sergei Koussevitzky
will open the formal musical season in
Pittsburgh, This is the ﬁrst of a.
series of concerts and recitals which
will include such attractions as
Jeritza, Escudero, Heifetz, and the
Chicago Orchestra, and is undoubtedly
the largest artistic opportunity of the
year, now that the International has
been discontinued.

The Boston Symphony itself is a
highlight. Some of us recall the full,
splendid evening Koussevitzky gave
us last year, and the VVagner of the
year before, played as Vvagner should
be played, with energy and imagina-
tion. This even‘ing’s program indi-
cates the same tasteful choice, both
in point of quality and variety of ap-
peal. During the ﬁrst half, several
of the more modern composers will
ﬁgure—Dc-bussy, in his “Prelude to
An Afternoon of a Faun,” and char-
acteristic numbers by Ravell and by
Corelli.

The last half is a performance of
Brahm"s “First Symphony.” We have
been looking forward to more Brahms
from the Boston Orchestra. Kousse-
vitzky handles him with strength and
feeling, and for those who already are
awakened to Bralim’s excellences, the
evening will be rich and pleasurable.
For some of us it can be the start of
an appreciation for a. personality who,
in his sound assurance and spiritual
iualities, is peculiarly suited to the
age.

Many Exhibitions

The trouble is that there is too
V-nuch to be seen and heard this Week.
Particularly, there has been a crowd
of minor exhibitions. For over a
week Carnegie Institute has had its
permanent collection of drawings and
lithographs on the second floor gal-
leries. XVhist1er, as lithographer, is
the dominating ﬁgure. He has any
number of sketches, studies. portraits.
find several ﬁnely executed views of
the Thames, the sort of thing we all
associate with Whis'cler’s name.
Somehow, though, it was more pleas-
ant to come across an unexpected
Rodin nude, and a Carot, and .a Tur-
ner watercolor, and a delicate tree
study by Theodore Rousseau. With-
out. a doubt, the collection is one few
know about. It is unfortunate that
the scant gallery room does not per-
mit the collection to hang permanent-
iy.
Then there is the “Twenty \Vomen”
Exhibition of Paintings on the fourth
ﬂoor of the Grant building. A num-
ber of these women are old gallery
ticquainlances Louise Pershing, who
won a first prize at last season's As-
sociated Exhibition, and who has an
ixcellent portrait hanging of a young
girl; Esther Phillips, who has a last
year’s study of three scrub-women,
together with a life study done in a.
slighter, perhaps more spontaneous
manner. Margaret Ruse, whose wa-
tercolors we particularly admired at
the Depression Exhibition, has a ﬁne
still life and a landscape which re-
calls possibly more than it should,
her watercolor technique. Pittsburgh
needs more of such undertakings.
Certainly a lot of credit should go to
the artists. Or is the depression re-
riponsible? Anyway, we think it’s a
swell idea.

Russian Icons Please

Of course, the Kaufman Russian
Imp-erial Treasury Exhibition squeezed
’n between things toward the end of
the week. Though it was interesting,
is was a rather wearisome affair. It
took two afternoons to get through it
all, what with squinting at ﬁnely
wrought trinkets, costly novelties,
‘nmiatures and such useless para-
ohernalia as_ porcelain ship models.
One can’t-lrelp being impressed with
*he sumpluousncss, but the feeling is
that all of this represeniﬁs a vanished
world, much farther off than it-really
is, a world that delighted in museum
'i.nterprises, and never quite found
itself in its imitations of foreign art.
l"lie real, old Russia is felt in the
earlier Icons with their Bysantine
-msterity, in their clarity of feeling,
wliere a deep gold Madonna and child
rest on a background of lovely egg-
-zliell ivory. These We could have
spent more time studying.

iDenfal [Drill Changes Its Trade

 

Goes into Art Business, Engraves Picture of Confucius
on Soft Slate for Chinese Room in Cathedral

 

_ By N adezhda. Iungerich

Let it not be said that the Dental School has failed in a contri-
bution to art——-perhaps it should be Art. In the Chinese room, one of
the ﬁrst ﬂoor class rooms of the Cathedral, there will be a picture of
Confucius engraved on soft slate; and a foot machine for drilling
teeth will accomplish the task.

This picture-—-in China called a “rubbing” because it is obtain-
ed by carving a picture upon stone, painting the raised surfaces, and
impressing thin rice paper upon it,¢~
will be the central feature of the
room. Hanging behind the profes-
sor’s chair, the picture, with its
cryptical symbols bordering it, will
be a source of wonder to the stu-
dents assembled in this room for
seminars.

Embroideries into which the souls
of countless, nameless artists have
been sketched will lend warmth and
interest to the wall. Scrolls written
by noted Chinese scholars will give
an atmosphere of oriental wisdom to
the room.

Represent Eight Virtues.

The eight virtues necessary to the
life of the Chinese will be represent-
ed amidst a brilliant pictorial ceiling
effect. The virtues: ﬁlial piety,
brotherhood, faithfulness, sincei‘ity,
courtesy, integrity, less of material
possessions——more of service, and
modestv, will be intermiiigled with
red and green sinuous dragons, and
beautiful phoenix birds painted on the ,
forty ceiling squares of dark and]
bright blue offset with gold leaf.

“This room,” remarked Teiig Kwci,
the artist and architect designing it,
“will be the only room in America
which will really exemplify Chinese
art and culture.”

This was Tong I{wei’s first oppor-
tunity to exercise his fertile oriental
imagination in an architectural line.
As one of the four or ﬁve best known
painters in China, he came to Amer-
ica to gather western culture. Hav-
ing received a. diploma from the Uni-
verslty of Washington art school and
a scholarship to Harvard, he returned
last year to China to head the art de-
partment at Yenching University at
Peiping, He spent the summer at
the Cathedral designing and execut-
ing his plans. .

Originated in 1929.

The idea of the Chinese room or-
iginated in 1929 with the Chinese
Students’ Club of Pittsburgh aided
by the Chinese merchants of the city.
The committee in charge now is
headed by Dr. Chi Fang Lai. Since
Dr. Lai is in China at the present,
John H. Tsui is the active chairman.
Other members are-: lvlrs. William H.
Yot, Dr. Y. Y. Leung. Samuel F.
Fung. and Dr. Clement I-‘Vang.

hear the future of these United
States discussed by representatives
of one political party, if not of both.
If you can’t’ get a’ Democrat on the
Red Network, you are pretty sure
to ﬁnd one on the Blue. And the bet-
ting odds‘ are two to one that it will
be Roosevelt himself. And further
odds are 10’ to one that he will refer
frequently to a certain Mr, Hoover so
that no child shall go guessing whom
he means.

To put it bluntly, the campaign has ,
entered the mud—slingins; phase be-
ca.use’a't this time the orators have
exhausted a none too ample supply
of hot issues. Night after night, from,
now until November 8, political bcl-5
ligerents will crowd the crooners off
the air.-

So far as the Democrats are con-
cerned. the best play between now
and election day is a play for time.
Mr. Roosevelt has already said all
that he has to say on political and
economic issues. The remainder of
his speeches can be little more than
repetitions. To introduce anything
new at this late date would be dan-
gerous. And Democratic managers
are all too busy proving themselves
“safe” to -risk posing as the mildest
of the mild ra.dicals—even with a large
dissa.tisfa.ction vote at stake. The
Democrats’ chief concern is holding
the support of that part of the elec-
torate which is determined to vote
Hoover out of the White House. And
to hold that portion, which is appar-
ently laizge and worth having, the
Roosevelt forces are passing the
hours in harmless. mud-slinging, con-
vincing and offending only the» less
intelligent.

. The Hoover Case

Mr. Hoover, of course, has not been
sitting idly at home by the ﬁreside,
waiting for an eviction order. He has
been out making speeches, which even
his enemies must admit are vote-get-
ling speeches. -As far as.oi*atory_goes
:‘«Ir._ Hoover does not register. He
lacks . the conversational style of
Roosevelt. He doesn’t have his op-
ponent's ability for humor. But he
certainly is pulling into line the
“solid” voting element; that is,.the
pepple who are determined to play
ea. e, . .

In spite, however, of- what his par-
tisans would have you believe, the
speeches of Hoover have not been

-Seventeen candidates were admitted
to aneimibership in the 'Men’s Debating
Association after the -completion of
try--outs Tuesday. . -

Of -this -nuinlber nine were new men,
and six of these -are fresh-men.’ Last

a member -of the squad, which, coach
W. M. Parrish believes, is signiﬁcant
of the quality of the freshmen de-
baters this year.

With one exception, all men -on the
squad are students in -the College,
Joseph Schwartz being a junior in

For students who are interested in

ris . ’

marked by an absence of mud for
mud. Mr. Hoover has as good a
case against Roosevelt as Roosevelt
has against Hoover. Neither candi-
date is starvingfor lack of material
for attacks. And neither candidate
has thus far refrained from using
what material he has.

By some trick or other the Ameri-
can public has been induced to be-
lieve that mud-slinging is a dishon-
orable and ungentlemanlv practice;
This belief, like many others of its
class, is as unfounded as the preju-
dice against ni'_9;ht air. It is the full
duty of a candidate to expose every
fault of his opponent. After all, a
national election is no bridge game
among friends. It is the concern, or
rather should be, of everybody. And
a. candidate does everybody a real
favor when he exposes his opponent
for a fraud and a cad.

Balanced lnsinuations

There is naturally a lot of fake ex-
iiose in every campaign for ofﬁce.
But any harm resiiltiner from the im-
plications and insinuations of politi-
cal‘ speeches is unlikely; for, on both
sides of the fence, the faking is about
canal in intensity, and whatever trick
phrases Mr. Hoover foists on his audi-
ence today, Mr. Roosevelt will make
up for tomorrow. The net result is
a feeling of satisfaction for each Dem-
ocrat and each Republican that he
is not voting for such a demon as is
his friend at the ofﬁce who belongs
to the opposing party.

In this year of depression when we
might expect the rise of a Bryan or
a La. Follette with some formula for
change in our economy, we strangely
enough see nothing of the sort. Nor-
man Thomas will probably receive
two or two and a half million votes.
But his support will be far from what
it could be if Mr. Thomas had col-
leagues more skilled in the writing of
platforms and campaign directing.
The Socialists haven't exactly pussy-
footed in recent years, but they cer-
tainly have failed to jump on speciﬁc
vote-catching issues. In the major
candidates we see two conservatives,
as ‘safe as any banker could wish
for: and one of them is sure to be.
awarded four years in the country's
li.i'_ehest political ofﬁce.

So far as most of us can determine,
the only difference between them is
that Roosevelt smiles a little more
broadly than does Hoover when an
audience cheers at the mention of
beer.

Forum Hears  
Prendergast

 

Democratic Control Would
Aid Country, He Says

Ed. Prendergast, former Pitt stu-
dent and during the World War,
youngest White House newspaper cor-
respondent, addressed the Inquiry
Forum Vvednesday on “The Demo-
cratic Platform.” The regularly sched-
uled speaker, D. L. Lawrence, Alle-
gheny county Democratic chairman,
was unable to be present.

Prendergast stressed the necessity
for a. Democratic victory, “because the
Republican machine has failed for the
past 10 years.” He asserted that not
only Hoover, but also Harding and
Coolidge before him, have been sub-
servient to the monopolistic utilities,
and that they do not represent the
will of the people.

“The Democrats,” the speaker
pointed out, “will, as their platform
them, carry on constructive
social measures. They advocate un-
employment and old-age insurance,
anti-trust regulation and water-power
control. Under Democratic control,
the government will not be perfect,
but a great improvement over the
present rule.”

Prendergast called Governor Roose-
velt a worthy candidate and said:
“He has a kind heart,‘ he is both mor-
ally and physically courageous, and
he is intelligent. He understands the
issues of this campaign and transmits
them clearly to the voters.”

“I have not attempted to give you
Camllaign propaganda,” the speaker
concluded. “My statements have been
those of a newspanerman viewing the
political situation.”

Fresh Eleven

Meets W- Va.

Unbeaten Teams Clash Under;
Fairmonf; Lights Tonight

 

Two unbeaten Freshman football
teams will clash tonight under the
fioodliglitg at Fairinont, when the Pitt ‘
fresh and the W'est Virginia yearliiigs
line up for the kick—off. ,

Pitt, with three victories in as many 5
starts, and \Vest Virginia, with two:
victories, loom as the strongest fresh-_.
men football teams in the district,-
and the battle tonight will probablvi
cliininate one of them from the un-
beaten class. Neither team is fa\’-I
cred for the contest, and, as the Moun-
taineer fresliinan team does not S6931!
to be behaving like their varsity, thoi
battle looks like a thriller from start .
to finish. ‘

Coach Gougler will likely start the;

.same eleven that defeated the Penn-

State frosh last Saturday, and the
same \Vest Virginia team that ran;
wild over Tech plebes, 48-6 will likely ,
oppose them, In that case, Pitt will.
have Sties and Baxter at ihe ends; VV. :
Hall and Bukirk at the tackles; Rob-;
erts at center; Franks and Detzel at
the guard posts, and a backﬁeld com-I
posed of Malarkey, Rator. RaI1(lO1l1',:
and Sliedalsky. There is also a possi--;
bility that Greene will start at quar-
terback. . . 1_

Onder and Miller will .-ikely be the
Mountaineer terminal men. and Maw-
hinney and Stydahar seem to be the
logical choices for tackles; Frantz at
center. and Elliott and Mayes at the
guards will complete the forward line.
Poilek, Kennedy, Terry. find Z319-Ski
seem to be the best suited for the.
starting backﬁeld.

Panther Cross Country
Teams Meet Penn State

 

 

Both the varsity and freshman cross
country teams will work out over the
diﬁicult Schenley Park course tomor-
row when the Penn State hElI'1‘1el‘S,
make their appearance. For the ﬁrst

Penn State has developed a habit
of turning out strong cross countrff
teams, and from a perusal Of DEISIZ

have Yet to defeat the LIODS in ﬁns

Coach Olsen will start the same
team that defeated Westminster and
\Vest Virginia, namely Captain CIISG.
XV-nggoiilioiisei‘, Albriglit, Kirkpatrick,

To offset this array, Penn State
will likely run Grenninger, VEUICISB:

The question, “what do you fellows

forth an instantaneous response. One

appeared to be stunned by the audac-

known as vent to their feelings by

CROSS-BLENDED For MILDER BETTER

HERE are entirely different kinds of tobacco.

Blend them and you get a different taste.

Cross-Blend them and you get a better taste.

While blending mixes the tohaccos together, Cross-Blending “welds” and
“joins” their ﬂavors into one.

Imagine doing this with the world’s finest cigarette tobaccos——many kinds
of Bright tobacco, a great many types of Barley tobacco and numerous
grades of Turkish tobacco! _

What you have when you’ve ﬁnished is Chesterfield tobacco—better than
any one kind, better than a blend of all kinds—really a new kind of tobacco
ﬂavor that’s milder, more fragrant and a whole lot more pleasing to the taste.
