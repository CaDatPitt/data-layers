Students
bound for
Charlotte

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

Itlooked like the Meineke Car Care
Bowl was going to be an unofﬁcial
away game for the Pitt football team,
as it had to play North Carolina in
Charlotte, N.C., but Pitt’s athletic
department is trying to make theat-
mosphere more Panther—friendly.

Any Pitt student who can get to
Charlotte for the game — Dec. 26 at
4 p.m. — will get a free ticket to the
game, Pitt assistant athletic director
in marketing and promotions Chris
Ferris said.

“I hope our students do what
they’ve done all year and come out
and support the team,” Ferris said.

To get a ticket, students have to

‘ either stop by the ticket office in the

lobby of the Petersen Events Center
or call the ticket office to reserve a
ticket. Then, all they have to do is
get to Charlotte, give their name
and show their Pitt ID card at the
will call office to pick up their ticket.
The last day to make a reservation
is Dec. 23.

Students can also go to www. V

pittsburghpanthers.com, click on
“Bowl Central” and reserve a ticket
online. The last day students can

reserve a ticket on the website is _

Dec. 25.

Ferris said that while the offer
is only good for Pitt students, if
someone wanted to take a non-Pitt
student with them, they can request
two seats next to each other, The Pitt
student would have to pay for one of
the tickets. 1

He also said the athletic depart- T

ment plans to accommodate all stu-
dents who show up. .

“We’re not going to limit a stu-
dent allotment,” Ferris said.

The Pitt athletic department

has more than 12,000 tickets to the .

game, Ferris said, adding that he’d
be pleased if the Pitt fan section was
mostly students.

“If our students are like they
were at home, we’ll have the best
bowl—ﬁeld advantage in the country,”
Ferris said.

Being a mall Santa has its perks

prising Gretchen McKay, afood writer
fromthe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; Carly
Adelmann, president of the Hillel stu-
dentboard; andRabbiDonniAaron——
judged the creations. Also in true Iron
Chef fashion, there was also a secret
ingredient.

Actually, itwas alack ofthe main
ingredient; Brianna McDonough, the
emcee, announcedthatthe cheﬁs would
haveto cook latkes with sweetpotatoes
instead of regular ones.

They could also use matzo meal,
yellow and orange bell peppers, Gala
apples, pears, yellow onions, mush-
rooms and spices in their cooking.

Contestants worked for 45 min-_

utes, ﬁercely chopping, grating and
ﬂipping

Mostof the teams offered latkes
withsourcreamandvegetables, aswell
assweetlatkes createdwithapplesand
pears. .
With about 15 minutes left, Mc-
Donough announced that the contes-
tants neededtodoalltheycouldto stop

nervously glanced atthe loomingsprin-
klers overhead and fanned the sizzling
latkes.

Becca Tanen, who spent months
organizing the event, bought a pair of
oven mitts  read “Certiﬁed Kosher
Maven,” and she presented them to
Schutzbank and Gorelick. Their latkes
came with an apple and pear sauce
protected by a triangle of carrots and
a garlic sour cream dip.

After the competition, a jazz band
playedchristmastimes, andthevokols,

traditional Hanukkah songs.

Mayorproclaims love of celebrities

Small-town Ohio mayor chronicles his encounters with Justin T imberlake and Omarosa in new book

Natalie Bell
Senior Staff Writer

David Bentkowski absolutely, without
a doubt, downright loves Seven Hills,
Ohio. Askhimand he’ll tell youin great
detail.‘

“I love my city so much  Nobody

moves, everybody knows each other, ,

everybody loves it there, we have great
services, it’s abeautiful community, nice
houses, totally safe, great kind of close

knitfarnilies,”Bentkowsl<i said. .

SevenHillsisthekindoftownwhere
the openingdaypofthe local little league
brings out 1,000 people. Bentkowski
estimates that over 40 percent of its
residents have lived in their houses for
more than 15 years and describes the
area as having a “small-town America
fee .” .

‘ Bentkowski loved Seven Hills so
much that he became the youngest

mayor in Ohio history in 2003. Before -

that, he had been elected city council-
man. It was during this time that he

went to dirmers and events and saw .

mayors doling out proclamations to
people, which Bentkowski explain are
“just words on paper just some nice
wo .”

But Bentkowski noticed people
were always excited to receive these

proclamations, and it gavehimanidea:
By giving proclamations to celebrities,
he could get publicity for his much-
adored city. In his book, “The Power
of the Proclamation,” he talks about
how givingproclamationsto celebrities
is like giving candy to children — they
love them. 7

“I mean, the whole joke is that I
realize, ‘Who cares what I have to pro-
claim?’ I’mjustasmall-townmayor, butl
thoughtitwas apretty novel gimmickto
promote my city,” Bentkowski said.

“The Power of the Proclamation”
details Bentkowski’s encounters with
various celebrities, of which he esti-
mates he’s had 75 to 100. Fromjustin
Tirnberlake, who he describes as “the
nicest celebrity I’ve ever met,” to Flea,
from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who’s
camp instructed Bentkowski: “Don’t
approachhim, hellapproachyouwhen
he’s rea .” -

Not only has this project, which
Bentkowskiworked on duringhisper-
sonal time, publicized his town, ithas
reaped other beneﬁts for Seven Hills.
Bands and artists like the Waterband
and Rachel Roberts have played in the
town’s summerfestival. Celebritieshave
also signed and donated articlesto auc-
tioned forcharity, asmostarewillingto
do favors for the young mayor and the
city he cares about.

“I could literally call Ornarosa or
Greg Fitzsimmons or Nely Galan or
some ofthese peopletocome emceethe
Seven Hills pageant, and they woul ”
Bentkowski said.

But he doesn’t like to overuse this
privilege, explaining that he’s become

individuals. One ofhis bestfriendsfrom

George (Colin Firth) and Charlotte (Julianne Moore) lament their lives.

ofthe  ‘ .
Adapted from the Charles Isher—

woodnovelofthe same name,‘‘ASingle “

Man” details one day-in 1962 Los An-
geles, on what is supposed to be the
lastday ofheartbroken BritGeorge Fal-
coner’s life (Colin Firth). Havinglosthis
male loverinacarcrashmonths before,
theﬁlmbeginswithadream sequence
of a naked George struggling under-

water, grasping to catch his breath. A
subsequent voice over, paired with a
sequence of him getting ready for the
"day, makes it apparent that George is
going to kill himself

The ﬁlm maintains this level of
bleakness throughout most of its run-
ning time. Over the course of his day,
we see the drunken, lonely antics of
his friend Charlotte (a wonderful Juli-

anne Moore) and the ﬂirtation of one
of George’s students, Kenny (Nicholas
Hoult), at the Los Angeles university
where he‘ teaches.

Though it seems so extemally sim-
plistic, ‘%\Single Man” risestoﬁlmmak-
ing great:ness with the extraordinary
amount of thought placed into every
scene and every sequence. From an
obvious symbolic ﬁxation on the eye
tothe exaggeration ofeveryhomoerotic
circumstance that George encotmters
— shirtless tennis players, a hustler’s
offer for a cigarette and more —- the
ﬁlmplays outlikeaperfectlyﬁtted suit.
It’s concise, with no part feeling out of
place or draggng in celluloid fabric.

Firth is magniﬁcent and Oscar
nominee-worthy within the ﬁrst 15
minutes alone. He portraysamanwho
hasforgottenwhatitisto extract simple
beautyfromtheworldaroundhim, and
the transformation he makes over the

course of the day—though barely no-
ticeable — is pitch—perfect.

Theﬁlmhas alreadydrawnnumer-
ous comparisonsto2006’s“Brokeback
Mountain,” but “A Single Man” is the
more thoughtful of the two ﬁlms.
Georgeis comfortable, if appropriately
silent, abouthis sexuality-—thereisno
self—loathing, and the love hefelttoward
the deadjim (Matthew Goode) tran-
scends the discussion ofhomosexuality
ofwhich “Brokeback” was so limited.

Ofcourse,theﬁlmisﬁ1llofgay—if
not sexually explicit —— content, and
pairedwith its heavy art-housetenden-
cies, “A Single Man” will very likely be
alienatingto anumber ofviewers.

Then again, that just extends the
parallelbetween Ford’s contributionto
fashion and to ﬁlm: Not everyone can

Big ‘Brother’ rocks out

Good Brother Earl boasts a strange name and blended sounds

Good Brother Earlis abandwith aweirdname
that doesn’t mean anything, yet it has a distinc-
tive sound forrned by a collection of rock, blues,
country and pop inﬂuences.

It’s anunconventional sound foranunconven-
tionally named band, butthis gives Good Brother
Earl an edge and more room to experiment. Ap-
parently, the Steel City has the ability to produce
an eclectic variety of musicians.

“We’re mostlyall Pittsburghers,”_]eﬁ'Schmutz,
the band’s acoustic guitar player andvocalist, said.
He describedtheband’sjoumeyto spread its name
as a challenge that cannot be done alone. _

“'Ihelocalmediahasbeenext1'emelyl<indwith
both airplay and in support of not only us, but all

’ localmusicin general,” Schmutz said. “Pittsburgh

is no Los Angeles or Nashville, but it really has it’s
ownﬂavorf’.

The ﬂavor of Pittsburgh seems to include the
media support-—withpositive coverage fromthe
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and City Paper—andfan
support alike.

“The folks that see our shows regularly are
fantastic,” he said. “They are all extremely sup-
porﬁveﬂ,

Good BrotherEarl setoutin1998 as a college

‘band, keeping its shows within the Northeast. It

has played at multiple venues in Ohio, New York,
Maryland and Pitisburgh, andwiththe CD release
partytomorrow nigat, the bandhas releasedthree
albums.

Good Brother Earl has the oddball sound and
name going for it, but where did the name come
from‘?

“The name Good BrotherEarl came ﬁ'om one
of ourprevious drummers,”he said. “We neededto
advertiseforashowandhe said, ‘WhataboutGood
Brother Earl?’ The name just ended up sticking.”

   
  

With a name chosen, the band went on to de-
velop its sound and try to record albums without
being signed to a record label.

“Although with the advances in recording"

technology, it has gotten much easier [to record
albums] ,” Schmutz said, “Skip Sanders, our key-
boardplayer, has astudio inhis house, which  is
great because you don’t have to worry about time

V constraints. We get to be creative and stress ﬁee

while we record.

“Ultimately, I think we’d love to be on a label,
because you getto reap the beneﬁts of all the public-
ity and advertisingthey offer,” Schmutz said about
record labels. f‘I will say, though, that being able
to have the creative freedom of an independent
label isverynice.As anindependent, wearesolely
responsible for how the record sounds and what
songs appear on it.”

After 11 years, Good Brother Earl has come
to enjoy both the hardships of recording and the
adrenaline oflive performance. ‘

“Recording allows you to put your song and
performance underamicroscope and shape it and
reallymold itinto somethingyoulike,” he said. “It’s
more creative. Playing live is great too, though.
It’s all about the energy of the music, and the ﬁve
of us all playing our parts cohesively to make the
performance something people can get in .”

Behind the scenes, the band members’ musi-

‘ cal tastes are very broad —-part of the reason

the band’s sound itselfis very eclectic. Schmutz
namedLedZeppelin,DaveMatthews, U2 andsome
classical and jazz music as some ofthe musicians’
favorite artists.

It createdasound so differenttl1at<:=\tegoriza—
tion isn’t-possible.

“We’ve always had adifﬁcult time intryingto
classify ourselves,” said Schmutz, “I thinktitatﬁact
that we enjoy so many diiferent styles deﬁnitely
comes outin our music.”

Good Brother Earl believes ithas found a sub-
stantialfanbaseinPittsburgh, and next, itwouldrft
mind winningover other cities. '

“Ultimately, we’d like to be on a national level, -

getting radio airplay, touringaroundthe country,”
Schrmitzsaid. “Butforrightnovv, ourlocaliansand
the support were received from the local media

Phone won ’t inspire Droid rage

Victor Powell
Contributing Editor

Motorola’s new Droid phone is almost the
iPhone killer that everyone seems to want it to
be — almost.

The Droid, the brainchild ofMotorola, Google
andverizon, isthelatestdevicetotry, once again,
to dethrone the iPhone as the de facto smart
phone.

Setupwasabreeze. Itcamewithapre-installed
Facebook application, so all I had to do was log
in, and it imported my friends’ Contact info onto
the phone. ‘

Agreatnewfeatureisits abilitytorunmultiple
apps atthe same time, allowingmeto checkmy
e-mail while listening to Pandora Radio, a long-
missed amenity on the iPhone.

In addition to Pandora Radio, the Android
Market (Google’s equivalentto Apple’s App Store)
offers roughly 10,000 apps with equivalents to
mostmajoriPhone apps, andthe number oiDroid
appsispoisedtoincrease signiﬁcantlywithoutthe
strictrestrictions Apple places on its app approval
process. Also, most apps give you avariety of set-
tings._For example, the Browserapp allows youto
change the text encoding for viewing webpages
to Unicode (UTF-8). I don’t know why I’d ever
want to do that, but I’m glad to kr1ow- the option
isavailable. _

With the exception of the Droid’s replaceable
16 GB microSD memory card and ﬁve megapixel
cameraandﬂash,thehardwareofthetwo devices
is almost identical, and so are their prices: $199
fortl1ephonevvitl1antwvdataplan,wit:l1unlimited

. data plans startingatabout $30 per month.

Witlithe iPhone and-Apple’s ﬂlunes, myphone
is automaticallybacked up everytimelconnect it
to my computerto recharge. It just does it. I don’t
have to wony about transferring my contacts or
trying to download my friends’ phone numbers
viatheir Facebook proﬁles.

The Droidhasakeyboard, butit’s almostcom-

‘ pletelyﬂat,whichdoeslittletohelpthosewithfat

ﬁngers. Consequently, it’s also heavier than the
iPhone, andwhilelwas usingthe Droid, the back
panel slipped off a few times when I would pull it
out of my pocket. Another point of ﬁustration
was its lack of gestures for its multi—touch screen
— common to the iPhone —— such as “pinch-to-
zoom.” Ironically, this is because Apple holds a

copyrighting, the term“Droid” is actually onloan
from Lucasﬁlm, the creators of “Star Wars.”)
Being ableto run multiple apps atatime sounds
likea good ideaatﬁrst, butthe reality isthatmobile
phones are not desktop computers, and increasing
the number of apps runningata given time signiﬁ-
cantly reduces battery life, aswellas performance.

‘ An application you’re running in the background

might freeze and crash, but you’ll never notice it
until your battery dies an hour later.
Fromarnore technical perspective, Iwasvery
irritatedwiththe lackofaconsistentuserinterface
(orUI) forthe Droid. It seems less responsive than
the iPhone. For example, some apps looklikeweb

pages made in the early ’90s, or itwill lag slightly
when I scroll Withthe iPhone, Apple has provided
an extensive and consistent U1 ﬁamework to its
app developers, so I can spend less time learning
howto use an app and more time just using it.

At the end of the day, an iPhone will do most

' things you’ll want it to do well and often auto-

matically. On the other hand, the Droid will do

. anything you’d ever want it to and leave you up to

discovering whether or not you really wanted to.
Withthat said, I’d have to recommend the iPhone
fornormaltotext-savvyusers andleavethe Droid
to the extremely tech-savvy power users.

Leadership. Work ethic. Character.
Toughness. _

These traits, the Pitt women’s
basketball teamwilltell you, deﬁnes
them this season.

Jania Sims returned after a sea-
son-ending injury last year to take
her place as point guard and coach
on the court for the 8-0 Panthers.

Shayla Scott worked over the
summer so she could switch from
aforward to a guard, because that’s
where the team needed her to play.

Taneisha Harrison became Pitt’s
leading scorer after the Panthers lost
Shavonte Zellous to graduation and
the WNBA last year.

It’s no wonder that beyond physi-
cal skill, Pitt coaches look for these
personality qualities in potential
recruits. ,

With players like Sims, Scott and
Harrison, the Panthers coaches have
been able to build not only asuccess—
ful team, but also a solid program
—— one that has advanced to three
straight NCAA Tournaments, includ-
ing the past two Sweet 16s. V

The team’s climb into the nation-

, al scene hasn’t gone unnoticed by

potential recruits, whom head coach
Agnus Berenato said are becoming
aware of Pitt’s recent success.

“They see us on ESPN, and we
have a lot of games on national tele-
vision,” Berenato said. “People are
talking about us now that wouldn’t
have talked to us three years ago.
Success breeds success.”

‘However, associate head coach
Jeffwilliams added that the coaches
still work hard to make sure the Pitt
name is recognizable, because there
might be some recruits who are still
unfamiliar with the program’s ac-
complishments.

“One or two good seasons doesn’t
mean you are there to stay,” Wil-
liams said. “It means you need to
keep working harder and harder to

 

Peoplearetalkingabout
usnowthatw’ouldn’thave
talkedtousthreeyears ago.

Agnus Berenato

ensure that you can make it back
again and again.”

Berenato added that having play-i

ers such as Zellous, who was drafted
in the ﬁrst round of the WNBA last
season, ﬁnd success at the next level
is attractive to recruits.

She said the coaches“ are cur-
rently watching a potential recruit
in Detroit who knows Zellous as last
season’s star rookie for the Detroit
Shock and as a former All-American
at Pitt. 1

“Every striving student athlete
knows about Shavonte Ze1lous,” Be-
renato said. “She was fabulous. She
was on television all summer long.
She has such a great passion for Pitt,

and we’re recognized through her.”

Berenato added that Zellous isn’t
the only Pitt player aiding Pitt’s re-
cruiting with success beyond the
collegiate level, as former Panthers
Xenia Stewart and Marcedes Walker
are currently playing professional
basketball overseas.

Williams said the team is using

"the recognition of the Pitt name in

order to branch out and ﬁnd recruits
from across the country.

The coaches go where the talent
is, Berenato said, so there isn’t apar-
ticular geographical area of focus.

Among the recruits that signed
during the early signing period in
November are players from Califor-
nia, Virginia and Maryland.

Kyra Dunn, a power forward
from Sacramento, Calif., was named
a Sporting News Honorable Mention
All—American for her senior season
and is rated the No. 42 power for-
ward by the Collegiate Girls Basket-
ball Report.

Marquel Davis is‘ a guard from
Fredericksburg, Va., who ranks as
the No. 18 guard by the Collegiate
Girls Basketball Report and was also
named a Sporting News Honorable
Mention All—American.

Rounding out the class is Asia Lo-
gan, a native of Baltimore, Md. The
Collegiate Girls Basketball Report
ranks her as the 31st best guard in
the country.

Although the latest recruits come
from across the country, Berenato
said that the coaches ﬁnd particular
recruiting success in local areas, such
as the tri-state area of Pennsylvania,
Newjersey and New York, aswell as

Sims Returns

Perhaps the most important
development for Pitt women’s bas-
ketball this season is the return of
point guardjania Sims, who suffered

a season-ending injury in the Pan-
thers ﬁrst game last season.

Head coach Agnus Berenato said
Sims’ return is invaluable to the Pitt
squad and that by the time she is a
senior, Sims will be one of the best
point guards in the country.

“It’s ﬁne to have four coaches on
the bench, but we can’t set the tempo
of the game from the bench,” Ber-

;; ms. :t:-.»—«.s:»-u> -01

 

 

enato said. “She sets the tempo of the

game with her good decisions. She .

means everything to-us.”

Sims is second on the team in
scoring, averaging 13 points per
game. Most importantly, however,

she gets her teammates involved with A.

5.3 assists per game, placingherthird

. in the Big East.

Sims knows where her teammates

in school history

are supposed to be on theﬂoor, Be— A

renato said, so she can give instruc-
tions if necessary. _

She was named most valuable
player of Pitt’s Thanksgiving tour-
nament after scoring 30 points and
dishing out 10 assists in two games.

Teammate Shayla Scott said the
team counts on Sims to calm them
down when necessary.

“[Jania] makes you feel comfort-
able and relaxed when we play with
her,” Scott said. “This will make us
better than last year, because we
know our point guard is ba 3,’

Climbing up the Rankings

ond-highest ranking ever this week,

recruits from her assistant coaches Williams,
Caroline McCombs and Yolett McPhee-Mc-
Cuin. ' E '
“Jeff Williams is just fabulous,” Berenato
said. “He’s very sharp. Caroline is very strong
in the Midwest. Yolett is from Portland, so she’s
taken- us to some very diverse areas.”
Another way the coaches locate players
is through scouting services and games, Ber-

enato said. The services provide top 100 lists ,

of players, by categories such as position and
location.

The coaches also attend recruiting camps
that run all summer andone weekend in the
fall and spring.

“We have recruiting weekends and recruit-
ing periods,” Berenato said. “There are times
when all ofthe coaches are going from 8 a.m.

information such as statistics and height.

“You watch reactions to officials calls,
coaches instructions, if their teammates make
a badpass -/— that sort of thing,” Berenato
said. S

Williams said that once the coaches ﬁnd a
player they want to recruit, they often work
through ' a ‘player’s high school‘ and AAU
coaches. ' '

“We want to get them on campus for a visit
to showcase what we have to offer and so that
they can see how things are run and envision
themselves as a player here,” Williams said.

If recruits want to see themselves on the
Petersen Event Center ﬂoor, all they have to
do is look at the characteristics of the players
that came before them: leadership, worth ethic,
character, toughness. ‘

Balanced Scoring

The Panthers currently have three players
averaging in double ﬁgures.

Taneisha Harrison leads the squadwith 16.1
points per game, followed by Sims with 13.0,
then Scott with 11.5.

Chelsea Cole is close to «being the fourth
Panther to average double ﬁgures, with 9.4
points per game and nine rebounds.

The balanced attack makes it difficult for
teams to focus on one player. When Harrison
struggled in Pitt’s 63-56 victory over Appala-
chian State, Sims and Scott stepped up with 16
and 17 points, respectively.

» Cole scored a double-double in the Thanks-
giving tournament win over Marshall with 11
points and 11 rebounds, factoring into her se-
lection to the All-Tournament team along with
Sims and Scott.

In Pitt’s victory over Western Michigan,
Harrison, Sims, Cole and Scott all reached
double  Shawnice “Pepper” Wilson also
reached double ﬁgures after shooting 5—of-5
from the ﬁeld.

Record Setters

Harrison and Cole both set career records
in Pitt’s last game, a 77-52 victory over Val-
paraiso. W . -

Harrison scored 17 points in the ﬁrst half
and 27 total on 11-for-22 shooting from the ﬁeld,
including 3-for-5 from beyond the arc.

She is currently seventh in the Big East for
scoring average.

Cole grabbed 15 rebounds for the Panthers,
with eight offensive — a new career high. She
is fourth in the Big East in rebounds per game.
She also scored six points in the contest.

“Chelsea is just coming into her own and is
becoming an explosive athlete,” Berenato said.
“She’s capable of 15 rebounds and more.”
