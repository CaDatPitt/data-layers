‘Big Six’ Seceiie from IF;  

Proportional Group Is Issue

By DAVE GREEN

A
V .

Pitt’s Inter-Fraternity Council was split wide open Wed-
nesday night when six major fraternities decided to call it

quits with that chronically controversial group.
The six, unoﬁicially known as the “Big _Six,

Delta Tau Delta, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma.Delta,

Kappa Alpha, Pi Lambda Phi, I

’’I include
Pi

and Sigma Chi.

IF delegates of the Big Six¢ \

walked out of IF after ‘a constitu-
tional amendment to introduce
proportional representation to the
council was referred to a commit-
tee to work out a compromise.
President—e1ect *D on Kettering,
Delta Sigma Phi, suggested the

committee. \

Proportional .Representaion ~
Under the present constitution,
each fraternity, regardless of size,

I - ‘is entitled to two voting delegates

to the council. -
The amendment. proposed that

' fraternities‘ be represented by one
_ delegate"'f’or"" every ﬁfteen mem-
- bers, but not to exceed four,de1e—

gates. O
Dan Purdy, Delta Tau Delta, ex-
pressed the opinion of the “Big
Six” concerning the sending of the
message to committee when he
votington the amend-mentnow and
said: “The only difference between
sending it to committee is in how
long it will take to kill it.”, He

_ claimed that he ‘had seen too many

measures disappear in commit-
‘Big Six’ Secede
The'Big Six left the meeting af-
ter the reading of a resolution of
secession presented by Joe Berger,
Pi Kappa Alpha. The resolution
claimed that I n t e r - Fraternity

Council -no’ longer served the best
interests of the six fraternities as

it was intended to do, and as such,
since they affiliated voluntarily,
they‘,could withdraw voluntarily.

The resolution also called the
walkout‘ a “temporary withdraw-
al” and stated that the six groups
would “discharge honorably all
obligations_” to IF that they now
have. I ‘
‘Rebel’ Exclusion Defeated

Immediately after the walkout,
Tom Piemme, Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon, moved thatthe -“rebels” be
excluded from all interfraternity
competition eﬁective immediately.
His motion was defeated by the
remaining delegates. Kettering,
speaking for defeat of the motion,
said he hoped the remaining fra-
ternities would not act like “those
radical Republicans did after the
Civil War.” '
”Dean of Men Theodore Biddle
said he hoped’ for gener.osity and
good will on the part of both
groups. ’ ’

He added, “This is not the kind

versity,” and pointed out that he
has seen three or four upheavals
in IF. He expressed his hope that
“the unfortunate situation could be

turned_into an advantageous one.

Coed Takes
T ivoli Prize
For Song

Winner of the ‘Spring Car-
nival theme so 11 g writing
contest and the $25 prize was
Ada Joseph, a senior in the
College and member of Alpha
Epsilon Phi sorority. ~

Her winning entry was an-
nounced by Carnival Publicity
Chairman Marilyn Ringler last
night at the Inter-Fraternity-Pan-
hellenic Sing and sung for the
audience by the I
Varsity - Quartet.
Her lyrics were ,
judged the most '
original and
adaptable to the
theme and pur-
pose of the_ Car-
nival. The title
of the song is
the theme of the
Carnival—-- “Ti- __
voli”——and the "
tune is that of
the song “Copenhagen.”

Mimeographed copies of the song
were passed out to the audience
last night and more_ copies are
available at the Student Desk.

The increased tempo of activity
at WQED is evident as Pittsburgh’s
educational television s t a t i o n
rushes to meet its ﬁrst deadline at
8 p.m., Apr. 1. ‘

This ﬁrst program, an hour—long
dedication ceremony, will feature
introductory remarks by Leland
liazard, president of the board of
directors of WQED, and Mayor
David Lawrence.

Following the initial program,
WQED will go on a. ﬁve-da.ys-a-
week telecasting schedule. The
three hours and 15 minutes air
time available to the station will
be divided into three segments.
The ﬁrst phase, from 1 to’ 2:30
p.m., will.feature in—scho0l proj-

ects.

The second segment of programs
will begin at 5 p.m. and will fea-
ture programs of "special interest
to children.

The last portion of the sta-
tions’ time will be devoted to
topics of a. more mature nature
including discussions of mar-
riage problems by the Drs. Mar-
tin of Pitt, creative Writing for-
ums by Lawrence Lee, live dra-
ma by student drama’ groups of
surrounding schools. Pitt Play-
ers will present the production,
“Grass Harp” in the near fu-
ture. .

WQED is planning an expansion
in the Fall, which depends on the
amount of support afforded the sta-
tion by the ten—county area which
it services. This support will come
in the form of yearly subscriptions
to WQED’s monthly magazine
“Program Review.” The station is
organized as a non—proﬁt‘ corpora-
tion and therefore cannot solicit
advertising. .

Pitt gave WQED its ﬁrst boost
when it allowed the station to use
the building, in which it is housed
for 15 years rent free. The original
outlay of money for remodeling
the building and for the purchase
of equipment was made by three
foundations: The Arbuckle-Jami-
son‘ Foundation, the Mellon Edu-
cational Trust, and the Ford Foun-
dation. .

events, the program included a
public debate between Pitt ‘and

school speech teachers, a _ Pitt

tional opportunities for speech

The secession of the “Big Six” from Inter-fraternity
Council last Wednesday night has been compared to the
, Civil War,. when the southern states seceded from the Union.
If this is thegcase then perhaps the University will be forced
t.o change its colors from blue and gold to blue and gray.
All we would need then would be an Abe Lincoln to eman-

to “stall the vote on the issue. All ballots cast
showed the factions to be as distinct as black and
white.

The resolution for proportional representation
presentedby the six was prefaced with a string
of “Whereases” that was tinged with the logic of
the ‘Southerners in their case against the “legisla-
tive tyranny” of the North. The Pitt rebels com-
plained about _“gross over representation of the
small, and woefully inadequate representation of
the large.” - -

Has Science Advanced‘ Too Rapidly? «

 

Even the resolution of withdrawal presented by
the six to IF had the ring- of the Mississippi ordi-

nance of secession.

93 Years Ago. Too

The Pitt ordinance claimed that IF had ceased
to serve the purpose for which the six had orig-
inally joined, and, that since their aﬂiliation was
voluntary, their withdrawal was legal. It took
a bloody way to persuadethe South that its sim-
ilar convictions were wrong.

Drama at the, Wednesday meting, was in abund-
ance too. Both the proposed constitutional amend-
ment and the resolution of withdrawal were hand-
ed for reading to the secretary, and president—elect,
Don Kettering. It’s no secret that the election of

Kettering as prexy was the -event that precipic" ‘

tated the long standing potential storm in IF.
Marbled Halls

Emotions ran high as the disgruntled delegates
stalked from the meeting room. Tom Piemme jeer’- n
ed the rebels: “Well boys, take your marbles and
go home.” A voice from the representatives of the
six retorted: “At least we’ve got all of our marbles."

After the official delegates of the Big Six left
the room, the outgoing officers of" the council,
three of them members of the seceeding fraterni-
ties, remained at the speakers table. ,

‘When one of the representatives started to chide
the officers about their loyalties, Joe Trattner, Pi
Lambda Phi, and vice president’ who was defeated
for the presidency elect, grinned and said “dam-

_ yankee.” '

nTl"le A-Bomb Holds the Answer

- monuclear de-

By Jim DeWeese
Within the next’ few years we
may be provided with the answer
to one of the most recurrent
questions put forth by mankind.

Has science advanced too "rapidly «
in comparison to mature and ’

logical reasoning? "

_On March 1st oflthis year,,

United States
‘scientists ex--
ploded a ther-,

vice a t t h e
4‘ atomic p r ov-
ing grounds in
th e Marshall
Islands. T h e
results were so
u n e x p e cted
that the next
test, scheduled,
to take 'place
within a week or two, has been
postponed. —

The results of this latest ex-
plosion have not been completed
and, in all probability, will never
be made known'to the general
public. But they were startling
"enough to force the Atomic En-
ergy Commission to write‘ off
the previous test (Nov. 1, 1952)
as a misﬁre. -

 

‘ Fireball 615 Square Miles
The details of the 1952 “mis-
,ﬁre” are almost as inconceivable

\

as the national debt. The actual .

ﬁreball" grew from the point of
detonation to a diameter of 28
miles. The ever-present mush-
room cloud of radioactive parti-

cles climlged to an altitude of‘

90,000 feet. It condensed and
rained its contaminating» mist
over the Paciﬁc. .

The total destructive force of
the bomb is subject to too many
varying conditions to make ac-

- curate prediction possible. Atom-

ic physicists state that the “mis-
ﬁre” was fully 250 times as pow-
erful as the Hiroshima blast or
equivalent to ﬁve million tons
of TNT. These ﬁgures are vir-
tually inconceivable. ’

Twice as Powerful
The physicists go on to state

that this month’s explosion was ,

probably twice as great as that
of the 1952 bomb. Authorities on
Guam said that the total popula-
tion of an island 160 miles south
of Bikini had been evacuated fol-
lowing a rain of atomic ash and
will be , unable to return until
heavy rains wash away the radio-

active particles.

Economists also have ideas con.
cerning the atomic bomb and its
probable eﬁect in the event of
warfare. Wars are fought for
political and economic gain and
it is‘ easily within" the realm of‘
probability that an atomic war
would completely annihilate all

such gains and thus defeat‘ its '

own purpose.

Greed and Ignorance Prevail

And in the face of this the
powers of the world still haggle
over minor technicalities. Dis-
trust, greed and ignorance con-.
tinue to cloak the world in a
seemingly impregnable canopy.

Compromise talks, are aborted ‘

and proposals, discarded as the
petty bickerings of diplomatic
envoys end in walkouts.

All want peace, but distrust A

and fear dictate that peace must
be insured by atomic weapons.
This type of insurance, however,
is —apt to become a means of
quenching the thirst for power.

We’ve seen one war in which '

the atomic bomb was used and
it’s possible that we may see ‘an-
other. So pull up an atomic pile’
and make ‘ yourself comfortable.‘
The next one should prove inter-

esting . . . whilevlt lasts.

Key .Man—Past, Present

 limeheckﬂesigns Buildings

By JUDY GOTTERER

Key man in the University’s
building plans—past, present, and
future—is »Albert A. Klimcheck,
Pitt’s resident architect. He was
_the man responsible for the archi-
tectural drawings and construction
of all the interior rooms of the
Cathedral of Learning and will be

A responsible for the design of all

its new buildings. _
“The .most valuable architec-
tural years of my Life,” said
Klimcheck, “have been and still
are devoted to the University.”
He came to.'Pitt in 1933 as the
University president architect.

The Nationality Rooms, Chan-
cellor’s offices, libraries, Fine Arts
department, Law school, Tuck
shops, cyclotron building and new
entrances to State and Thaw Halls
have all been prepared under his
care. A ’

Depression Project

“Because the building was built
during the depression, the Cathe-
dral couldn’t be completed prop-
erly,” Klimcheck explained. “Com-
pletion of an observation pavilion,
the ground floor, the basement,

’ and many of the rooms have been

delayed due to a lack of funds.”

Space has been allowed for an
auxiliary automatic elevator to
take. people transferring on the
36th ﬂoor to the pavilion. De-
signs for the pavilion rooms,
which will permit a view. of the
city in four directions, were
completed many years ago.

Klimcheck is presently designing

. the George Hubbard Clapp Science

Hall. The basic style of the build-

~ ing is Gothic architecture but less

ornate than the Gothic of the
Cathedral. June has been set as

‘the tentative date for ground

breaking.
Design Flexible

The design provided for about
eight and one-half million cubic
feet of space that can be expanded
or contracted to meet varying de-
partment requirements.‘ ‘

Builders added the stone-work

. to the Cathedral’s‘ steel girders
. starting from the top. of the 42nd,

floor and working, down to the
ground. “Each ﬂoor’s stone rests
0 its individual ﬂoor beam fas-
tened under the wall,” explained
Klimcheck. “The beam transfers
the weight to a steel column which
extends from the ground to the
top of the building.” ,
If the building were made of‘
solid stone without the steel gir-
, der, the wall of the ﬁrst ﬂoor of
the Cathedral would be ten’ feet
thick.

“Plans for anall-purpose room

' "on the twelfth ﬂoor for the women

of the University are in the ﬁnal
preliminary s t a g e,” Klimcheck

Former Gopher Guard

Just in Time for Drills

The Athletic Department

this morning announced the

addition of Bill Bevan, former All-American guard at Minne-
sota, to Red Dawson’s coaching staff.

Bevan will arrive in Pittsburgh¢
‘Bevan has been with the Bank-

tomorrow and begin his service
as line coach with the opening of
spring drills Monday. Either Bob
Friedlund or Ernie Hefferle, pres-
ent line tutors, will move into the
end coaching job, since basket-
ball “duties limit Bob Timmons’
availability in this_ department.

The new coach, a resident of
Chisago City, Minn., near St. Paul,’
assisted on the line for Dawson
from_ 1936 through 1940 when
Dawson was head coach at Tulane.

‘Starred Under Bierman

In those years Tulane boasted,
the best lines in the Southeastern
Conference, going undefeated in
1939 until the Sugar Bowl game
with Texas A&M.'

Bevan starred for Minnesota
during the years Dawson assisted
Bernie Bierman there 1932
through 1935 and after his
graduation spent a year as line
coach at Iowa State Teachers be-
fore joining Dawson at Tulane,

He worked a year at the same
job at Dartmouth before entering
the service in 1942, where ‘he rose
to the rank of lieutenant colonel
in a Paciﬁc anti—aircraft outﬁt.

Eight on Staff

Since his discharge in_ 1946,

should place high. Although his
best times have been bettered by
two of his competitors he may.
come through for us.” '

O’Nions, Grady contends, may

surpris_e. “He has’ ‘a chance of
placing.

national competition ‘and will

probably ﬁnd the “cream of the“

Grid fans can look forward to a more varied offense this
year on the part of the Panthers. The enlisting of another
experienced line coach,'Bill Bevan, shows the direction from
which Red Dawson is building. He recently revealed that
he intends to work in plays from both balanced and unbal-
anced line formations-———which means single wing and split-T,
in addition to the regular T. .

_ Evidently the Redhead feels that the forward wall is
loaded with good material this year. The ﬁne crop of fresh-
men has a lot to do with it, much to the credit of. Steve

When asked how it is possible. to beat a well-trained
man of such heft, Rex Peery recalled seeing a match where
a grappler 85 pounds lighter than his 295-pound opponent,
who completely obscured him on the mat, kept outmaneuv—

escape before the giant could get a pinning hold, he thus
swapped one point for two each time and won the decision.

Delts Enter
IF Playoffs

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

It took a last period spurt of
14 points by the Delta Tau
Delta quintet before they
were able to subdue a stub-
born Phi Gamma Delta ﬁve,
46-43, at the Field House Wed-
day.

The win moved them into a play-
off berth for the IF championship.

The Delts grabbed the opening
tipoff and scored on ’a driving
lay-up shot. From there on the
game was deadlocked three times
before the ﬁrst period ended 12-10
in their favor, and the half at 26-
24.

Phi Gams Click .

Paced by Bob Francis (his
teammates call him Bevo), the
Phi Garn offense began, to click.
With Al Backus setting up the
plays for the big, aggressive pivot-
man, he gave his team a com-
manding seven-point lead with the
aid of some deadly set-shooting by
George Gump before the Delts
could stop the high geared at-
tack. »

With the period rapidly draw-
ing to a close the host team hit
on two ‘successive ﬁeld goals to
narrow their opponents’ —third
quarter lead to ﬁve points at 37-
32. ‘

It took only a few minutes for
the ﬁghting Delts to tie the game
