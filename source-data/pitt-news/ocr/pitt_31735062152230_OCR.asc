Pitt men to be unhealthy, for ‘they
drink over 140 -pin-ts oftchocolate

The demand for candyis .even

ite with a sale of 960 every week;

Council Drops Plans

To Hold’ Pep Meeting

“There will be no pep assembly
prior to the Penn State ame next
Thursday,” said Emanue Fishkin,
Bus. Ad. '30, chairman of Student
Council assembly ‘committee, when
asked regarding plans for this an-
nual meeting. .
Inability to obtain a suitable
Speaker for the occasion, coupled
with the fact that the-administra-
tion has declined to operate the Uni-
versity on a Friday schedule of
classes next Wednesday were the
reasons given by Fishkin for elim-
inating the assembly. —
Plans for a special assembly con-
ducted by Student Council are under
way, according to Fishkin and ef-
forts will be made to procure Phil-
lip LaFo1lette, recently elected gov-
ernor of Wisconsin, for an address
before the Christmas holidays.

“Writing detective stories re-

“All the clues must be given to the
reader, but must appear where his
attention is distracted by some other
phase of the story.” , S ,

There are three types _of detective
stories according to Mrs. Cretcher.
First there is the thriller, in which
the situation is most important;'s'ec-
ond, the ‘story in which character is
featured, and, last a combination of
both elements, which she considers
the best.

declares. —

“It is the fashion today in detec-
tive stories to disclose the criminal
in the last page of the last chap-

*arise who will have enough courage
to develop a new technique.”

Mrs. Cretcher discussed the art
of writing detective stories before
the Readers’ Group of the Woman's
Association of the University at the
home of Mrs. David’ Craig last
Wednesday. .

She is the wife of the head of the

“A mere child shall lead them."
That's how they described pretty,
brown-haired Mary Agnes Vitches-
tain when she still wore ribbons in
her hair. Of the host of transfers
who have joined our ranks, there is
probably none so interesting as she.
Miss Vitchestain entered the Uni-
versity without pomp and ceremony.
A decade ago she was hailed as a’
child wonder. Now she still amazes
thousands by her eloquent powers of
oratory, her remarkable force of de-
livery, her prodigious knowledge of
the Gospel, and her sound, ﬁery rea-
soning. -

Believes Abilities are God-Given
_ If you haven't yet guessed, Mary
is a preacher. Religiously, an Evan-
gelist. She sincerely believes that

er abilities are God-given and
comments: “It comes as naturally
to me as drinkin water."

“When did I egin preachin ?”
she reiterated as a twinkle lit er
dark brown eyes. She explained
how at the age of four she as-
tounded her parents by requesting.
them to gather about, as she
crawled upon the chair and perora-
ted to them in her own puerile fash-
ion. Barely nine, Mary -Agnes pub-
licly an her Evangelistic career
when s e appeared at the Perrys-
ville Avenue Orphanage. Here she
preached for a year to the “wrecks
of humanity, men whose homes,
lives and futures had been devas-
tated." At the age of thirteen she
expanded her work to one of na-
tion-wide scope, when she ‘ be an
traveling. Each year since tat
time she has devoted her summer
months appealing to people from
the “dregs of humanity to the up-
per crust." In her extensive trav-
els, Evangelist Mary has preached

Studies Human Problems
Mary is a senior in the college.
An English major, she is enrolled
in the lay Production class which
she hopes some day’ she may use to

advantage in her ministerial work.

She feels that she can better appeal
to her followers by the eye than by
the ear and, so, the dramatization
of certain Biblical incidents is one
for Evangelism.
Mary Agnes realizes the greater po-
tentialities in her Evangelistic ef-
forts, because she “comes in contact
with so many individuals from every
part of the country. . .We know
their heartbreaks, their difficulties,
their problems and we make a study
of them." Her college education,
she says, is helping her to under-
standvthe plight of these individ-
uals.
Dislikes Appelations

Questioned about the future,
Mary. hesitated and smiled. Finally
she demurely sputtered, “I have a
very funny idea that I should like
to marry. . ." And that sufficed.
But she does not intend to discard
her Evangelistic teachings entirely
after matrimony. No!

How does she like Pitt?

‘'1 love it; all this hustling of P

students after one comes from a
small college like Wheaten.” And
modern youth? She doesn't con-
demn this new generation but rather
sympathizes with them. “They. are
a ﬁne, whole-hearted. young people,”
she agrees, however.

Says Bloom, Sun- Telé Mgr.

 

in J. D. PAULIIS

“Mr. Bloom, what do you think of
college journalists?" And this ques-
tion, thrown
who holds the estinies of the Sun-
Telegraph circulation, seemed to
stump him for a minute. Maybe it
was because he had never heard of
college writers called “journalists"
before, or maybe because we don't
look like journalists. We admit we
don't have long hair, carry note-
books, wear pink and green smocks
and eat caviar, but we did want to
know what the world, and particu-
larly our brethren of the Fourth
Estate, thought of us.

So the question was put to Mr.
Bloom .and he, almost drowned out

by a thousand or so typewriters, an-,

swered: “Well, you're a pretty good
lot.” And already we began to feel
better. “But you're too sincere,” he
continued. “You like to write like
Shakespeare or Milton or some of
your other poets and newspapers
aren't like that.”

And. so, inspired by the conven-
tion here today, knowing that a

ly at the man‘

{hundred brother collegians were
‘right behind, we ventured. “Isn't
lthe standard of a college papgr
higher than a metropolitan sheet?"
And to our surprise Mr. Bloom an-
swered, “Most assuredly. much
higher. You take care of your bal-
ance, your stories lmd_Y01lr_?editori-
als. That's the trouble with your
college papers, theyfre too good for-
us common journ ists." , ,
He stopped, looked out the wmv '
dew and, picking up a Sun-Tele~'
graph, he showed us some of the
writers, Brisbane, Gough, etc.,-etc.
“That's the way to write,” he said,
brightening with pride, “That’s the
way to write. Tell them what you
have to tell them and then tell
them what you've told them. And
when you've done that. you're
through with that story. See 1" .
We nodded, shook hanks, and be
gar! our exodus through the wind-
1ng_ typewriter tables of the paper's
scribes. And as we walked along
everybody looked and seemed to
say, Look, another College JOUR-
NALIST." And a long yawn.

Passion Players May
Hold Play In Stadium

 

"To me the most impressive facts
about Pittsburgh are its smoke and
the wonderful kindness of its peo-
ple,” said Adolf Fassnacht, who por-

trays Christ in the Freiburg Pas-j

sion Play, at the Syria Mosque this
week. Mr. Fassnacht. the seventh
generation of his family to portray
Chiist, has played this role over

7,000 times. I

The Freiburg Passion Play, since
1635}. has been given periodically in
Freiburg, Baden, rmany, as well
as in every other important city in
Europe and in most cities in
America. ’ '

Superlatives would come'short of
describing the artistic - presentation
of the life of Christ as portrayed
with so much simplicity, inspiration
and pathos by the Freiburg players.
The hope of its directoris to pre-
sent it- again in.Pittsburgh in open
air, “perhaps in your own stadium.”
he added. .

terms foreign to a cub reporter;
and yet he must compose a story
because someone compiled a lot of
data for the University of Pitts-
burgh for the years 1925-1930, and
made _it inclusive at that.

And yet the ﬁgures are interest-
ing. For instance, for the year
1925-26, there were 3,348 under-

graduateimen enrolled at the Uni-
versity, including the special stu-
dents and those in the four under-
graduate schools. Of these 1,722
were in the College, 515 in_the
School of Engineering and Mlnes,
721 in Business Administration, and
490 in Education.

By way of comparison, there were
during the year 1929-1930 a total

number of 3,363 undergraduate men
enrolled, showing a gain of but ﬁf-
teen men over the former year.
These ﬁgures, however, at first
glance are a little deceiving because
of the great number of men regis-

tered in the professional schools. 3

With the use of about ﬁve pieces of
scratch paper and three lead pen-
cxls we ﬁgured out that there were
1,649 men enrolled in the College,
632 in Engineering and Mines, 698
in Business Administration and 348
1n the School _of Education. Engin-
eermg and Mines is the only school
showing an increased number‘ of
men students. As for the compara-
tively low number pursuing the vo-
cation of teaching, that seems to in-
dicate that the coed’s “A”“will not
be the result of coquetry as the
“D” male student would like to
have you believe.

ODAY AND TOMORROW the University will be host to
  editors and business. managers of more than ﬁfty college
‘ ‘Ya ._ newspapers meeting here for the. 1930 convention of the
, - ational College Press Association. An elaborate and
7 av:  ed program has been arranged by the Pitt chapter_‘of
 ma Delta Chi, national professional journalistic fraternity,
",an or whose auspices the convention is being held. _ _
» , During the two days that the convention will be in session,
.: ..delegates will attend a round of business and discussion meet-
 L-lugs, dinners and social entertainments. Prominent newspaper
 .- men will address the delegates and lead several of the discussion
forums which form part of the convention program. _ ‘
.- 3' '_ It is certain that there will be a multitude of questions to
  talk over, wonder about and perhaps settle. To the men attend-
4’ ' lag the convention is the job of interpreting campus news, ad-
 circulation, securing sulficient advertising revenues,
and determining editorial policies. _
» The discussion, however, will not be devoted exclusively to
 technical and ethical policies of their own activity, but will also
7 ‘embrace the entire aspect of extra-curricular work common to
3 the modern university and college. Occupying favorable posi-
 tions for an observation of student and administrative activi-
' ties in their individual schools, the delegates should have some
deﬁnite opinions of this phase of school life. Strong as their
_ ‘opinions may be and the acumen with which they interpret stu-
’_dent life on the campus, they will havea difficult time sug-
gesting remedies for many of the usual problems of undergrad-
-irate activity.‘ But at least their interest to know other opin-
‘ions in the college world is commendable.
_“_':¥ -' The-entire University student body joins Sigma Delta Chi
in welcoming the delegates and wishing them a pleasant time
. during their stay here.

 

 
   
   
 
 
 
   
    
  
 
 
 
 
    
    
 
  
 
  

 

A  Chancellor’s Reception

HANCELLOR JOHN G. BOWMAN will meet more than
1,000 parents of freshmen at the annual reception held
in their honor tonight. _. .a function that is largely dis-

’ tinctive to this University. _ _

 Few schools, especially urban schools of the size of Pitt,

— attempt to help the ﬁrst-year student so thoroughly as is done

. - ‘by the administration here. Introduction of the freshman to col-

- _ Jlege life by means of Freshman Week, the faculty and_upper-

 _ iclassmen adviser system and now the parents’ reception are

7311 means of helping the new student adapt himself to the Uni-

giversity life.-

Dean Robert C. Clothier, chairman of the committee ar-

   lrangiiig for tonight's reception, stated the purpose of the event

‘§§wihen he said, “The University seeks to have the parents meet
A ’-the faculty in order to enlist their counsel in guiding and en-
 couraging the students most understandingly in their wor .”

  All The Same

 C  NNOUNCEMENT THAT THE CHAIRMAN or the junior

, , prom this year would be selected by Student Council in-
stead" of by a class cabinet. the former procedure, has
 aroused little comment. Juniors evidently feel that the
 _ governing group will be as fair, impartial and thorough in its
;; . choice as would any other official body.
 "L '. Council will probably make its selection from a list of can-
 ididates ﬁling petitions before December 3. The only drawback
..="_l'.o the system is the fact that Council is not obligated to con-
-ﬁne its choice from those students submitting petitions. But
the body will hardly do otherwise. If they should they would
subject themselves to probably not unwarranted criticism.

Good Health Week

 ’ ‘HEALTH WEEK NOW IN PROGRESS under the sponsor-

ship of the Women's Athletic Association again directs
 attention to the necessity of a careful observance of

Bits About

PITT

We left Pittsburgh at 3 o'clock in
the morning in a fog and bound for
Columbus. We recognized Wheeling
by the toll bridges. Unfortunately,
we had forgotten to turn oi the
lights and s wary watchman saw
us sneaking up the middle of the
roadway. We gave him a nickel to
buy himself a cigar but we didn't
save any money. The toll was only
a mckei anywayﬂ On the other side
of the Ohio river, we breathed a
diiferent air, inurkier, soupler and
foggier than you or your ancestors
would have believed. Feeling our
way along with the front bumper,
we reached the Buckeye tableland in
time for breakfast.

Columbus is the capital of Ohio,
and the name of the discoverer of
America. ‘‘In 1494, Columbus heard
the waters roar.” It's easy to re-
member the date. We pulled into
Columbus, the city, we mea , about
11:30 a‘. m., Saturday, and discov-
ered a to 8.1 Welcome awaiting us.
-Blushing uriously when we met a
queen on every street, we soon had
a royal ﬂush. But we reached old
Ohio ﬁeld without misadventure.
Parking the car, we lunched at one
of the campus beaneries, strolled
about the lovely Ohio State campus
to carefully observe the beauties of
the place, and ﬁnally marched_to
the stadium a mile or more behind
the band. As. Mr. Weslager has
told you in another column of this
paper, the stadium is in the shape
of a horseshoe, just for luck, that
is, Ohio State's luck. Both the Ohio
State and Pitt bands gave startling

trier scored a_ clean-cut win over a
bicyclist, and the game was on. It
was bad ﬂying weather, but the
aerial route was the favorite meth-
od of , pigskin transportation for
both teams. (Just our way of say-
ing that both teams threw forward
passes.) The Pitt cheering was ex-
cellent considering how far from
home the rooters were. Of course,
the Ohio boys made more noise but
it lacked undertone and bass notes.
The Pitt» dental students present
kept the Pitt yells lower in the
scale- they were so far down in the
moat . e
or as :-

Giii er ale in Columbus is sold the
way t ey sell orange juice around
this ‘neck of the woods. There are
ginger ale emporiums where this
tasty fluid is dispensed at 5c 9. glass
on every street, almost. After
drinking a few tumblers full, we
went to the show to rest up for the
long drive home. In the show, we
gave the Pitt hand clap when they
showed a picture of the Ohio State
band playing before the President.
By the way, you may be interested
to know that the Ohio State band
practices two hours a day, ﬁve days
a week. No wonder they are pretty
good!

C # C

The fraternity houses at Ohio
State are much like the ones at
Pitt. When we asked one of the
Ohio State varsity football players
where a certain lodge was located,
he gave us the exact address with-
out any trouble while two coeds
stood and stared at us in amaze-
ment. We don’t understand it to
this day.

# # *

The trip home was uneventful.
There were a lot of Pitt cars on
the road and we didn't get to feel
a bit lonely. The meals we got in
Ohio were excellent, luscious, deli-
cious, appetizing, and , all home
cooked, except for the ones in res-
taurants. Go to Ohio and learn how
to eat. Maybe we were usually hun-
81')’. but those griddle cakes with
real maple syrup were worth the
trip alone.

Coed Singers Plan
Yuletide Atmosphere

Steaming taiikards of ale, for a
long time merely imaginary, are
now to be an actual fact. The or-
der has been placed and allthe es-

sentials to make us merry as we
ather around the yule log are on
t eir way. December 25th will see
yule. log blazing midst the merry-
makers, composed of the women's
and men’U'_ glee clubs. Carollers,
jesters and dancers will add to the
entertainment of the evening.

Mrs. Ayars, director of the Wom-
en's Glee Club, is being assisted by
Dr. W. H. Wright, men’s director,
and Adelaide Hunter, Col. ’32. The
first joint rehearsal was held Tues-

This investigation on vitamin C,
the most unstable of vitamins-the

one that prevents scurvy and that is
found abundantly in citrus fruits,
tomatoes, apples, carrots and milk
——destroyed the idea so prevalently
entertained, namely that aluminum
utensils contaminate food cooked in
them by metallic deposits. “Traces
of aluminum are so minute as to be
completely negli 'ble,” Dr. Gerald
J. Cox. senior fel ow on the cooking
utensil fellowship, said. The vitamin
experiment which preceded Dr.
Cox's investigation proved that
vitamin C in milk is twenty per cent
destroyed by boiling whether the
utensil is gass or aluminum. By
feeding iron and aluminum salts to
guinea pigs, Dr. Cox and his six as-
sistants were able to determine the
similarity in effect. This result may
change the habits of cooks who in-
sist on using iron kettles because
of their incorrect belief that toxic
effects are attributable to cooking
with aluminum ones. Pasteurization
tests showed that copper is most
conducive to forming salt deposits,
often tinting the milk pale blue.
Aluminum salts are fatal to the ani-
n.al only when they exceed the per-
centage of phosphorous salts. Eat-
ing sauerkraut every day cooked in
an aluminum kettle would not be
fatal’. Food poisoning in all cases
is due, not to utensil corrosion, but
to bacteria.

Beginning Monday, the Y. W. C.
A. is sponsoring a series of discus-
sions which should be of interest
to all students, regardless of their
personal bias in theological doctrine.

Religious and their
RELIGIOUS meanings are to be
DISCUSSION considered in these
talks; the speakers
are men of authority and tolerance,
men who are acknowledged spokes-
men for their particular creed. Two
of the speakers are men who par-
ticipated in the public forum, held
recently, which caused such a ﬁery,
albeit momentary, excitement. Rev-
erend Goldenson will again bring
the message of “Judaism” and Dr.
Albert E. Day will present the Prot-
estant point of view. Reverend
James’ Reeves, professor of philoso-
phy and psychology at Seton Hill
College Wlll represent the Catholic
religion. Be assured that these men
are adroit speakers, that they are
men of thought.

Whatever may be your natural in-
tercst in these talks, I wonder if you
do not feel a certain lack of balance
in this series of talks, despite the
high quality of the individual speak-
ers. But after all. three points of
view may well be enough.

Faculty Directory
Appears Next Week

The University ‘Directory for

week. All of the ﬁnal touches are
being put on the work before the
publication. The Directory is issued
each year under the sponsorship of
the University With William Mor-
rell, University editor, directing the
work. _
. Last year’s directory contained
some twelve hundred names. This
year there will be an addition of
ﬁftﬁlseven to the faculty.

e Directory serves as a guide
for ﬁnding any of the officers, cleri-
c..l assistants, ‘and faculty mem-
bers. It contains the home ad-
dresses, telephone number of each
and the department that each is
connected with. In the front of the
book is a list of the twenty-three
buildings on the cam-pus with the
campus address and the abbrevia-
tions of the buildings given. There
are thirty-four administrative offi-

 

cers in the University, headed by

perimentation evolved an edible sub-
stitute for animal casing previously
used for “wienies” as well as the
ordinary accompaniment of griddle
cakes. A cellulose-plant-product was
devised from cotton linters that is
not only superior hygienically, but
also easily manufactured. Now es-
pecially designed machines can and
do turn out seamless “cotton shirts
for wieners” in any size or length
or quantity. These cellulose casings
are readily cooked and eaten and
digested.

A yeast food known commercially
as “Arkady,” developed by Dr. H. A.
Kohman, is a preparation of inor-
ganic salts used in dough mixing.
It has made possible savings esti-
mated to aggregate $40,000 a day
in the baking industry by eliminat-
ing unnecessar consumption of
dough in the “ri ng” process.

Water soluble, concentrated cof-
fee resulted from four years of re-
search by C.- W. Trigg, while later
Roy Irwin showed that caffeinic
beverages should not have a place
in the diet of the young or aged.

Dr. Werner W. Duecher’s research

reinstated candy into its place as a
part of the diet by demonstrating its
nearlg a hundred per cent assimila-
tion y the body. Through his ef-
forts and study, gelatine, one of the
most important and nutritious in-
gredients in marshmallows, has been
used ‘ improve the texture, digest-
ability, and keeping properties of
various other candies.
_ Other fellowships of the past have
investigated ﬁsh products, fruit bev-
erages, carbonated beverages, and
breakfast foods. Dr. E. R. Harding
developed _a process by which the
hull of rice—heretofore discarded
in the milling process——can be made
into an edible product valuable as
“roughage” in the breakfast food
diet. He has also invented two new
breakfast foods, now well known-
Heinz Rice Flakes and Heinz break-
fast Wheat.

In carrying out its research proj-
ect of foods, Mellon Institute has
co-operated with outside agencies.
Hospitals, medical schools, orphan-
ages, and homes for the aged have
been utilized by fellowship holders.
The «latter institutions have been
particularly important in determin-
ing taste reaction to various new
foods—responses which are hardly
possible from guinea pigs.

Owl Contest
Starts Soon

Will Award Many Prizes To
Leading Sororities

 

 

An attractive silver tea set--a
pair of silver candle-holders-—a solid
gavel——countless surprise awards-—

all will be presented to winning
campus sororities at the end of the
present Owl sorority contest, ac-
cording to Anne Kovach, Col. ’82,
circulation manager.

Contrary to last week's announce-
ment, the prizes for this contest will
be divided among the several win-
ning sororities, instead of being
awarded in a lump sum to the ‘sin-
gle winning group, as was the case
in last year’s contest. The staff ex-
pects this arrangement to stimulate
interest in the contest, inasmuch as
each com eting sorority has a. much
greater c ance of winning one of the
many valuable prizes. _

The first named prize, a silver tea
set, will be given to the sorority
reporting the sale of the greatest
number of 1931 Owls during the con-
test. The second award, a pair of
silver candle-holders will go to the
coed fraternity selling the ‘next
largest number, and a mahogany
gavel will be presented to the group
gtégisteiing the third highest num-

r.
In addition to these awards, a
novel surprise prize will be pre-
sented to each sorority selling ten
or more 1931 Owls; and as a ﬁnal
esture, the stall’ will award. abso-
utely free, a copy of the 1931 Owl.
with the name of the sorority en-
graved in gold on the cover, to each
Coed fraternity in which every sen-
ior member has purchased a copy of
the 1931 Owl.

Send Letters

Under the direction of Ben Weiss-
man, Col. '81, sorority contest man-
ager, letters have been sent out to
social fraternities, assigning‘ at least
one fraternity to each campus so-
rority. Each sorority will select
three members to represent it in
the drive. ‘

The 1931 Owl will be priced at an
exceptionally low ﬁgure, $8.50 for
non-seniors. Two dollars may be
deposited with the sorority coed so-
licitor, and the remaining $1.50 will
be payable upon receipt of the copy
of the Owl.

Season C)pens For Pitt
With Production Of

Players
Irish Comedy

sly THE PLAYGOER.

Under the direction, of Mr. Carl
Cass, the Pitt Players began what
promises to be _a most successful
season with a well-ﬁnished per-
formance of Lennox Robinson's
pleasant comedy, “The Whiteheaded
Boy." Robinson is one of the play-
wrights who made vital the Irish
Theatre movement; he is a worthy
contemporary of the better known
members of his group; chief of
whom are Yeats and Lady Gregory.

Mr. Cass gave to Robinson's com-
edy something for which Pitt Play-
ers has shown‘ a decided need in
past productions. He gave the play
tempo; one could feel the movement
of the action. Then, too, the stage
balance was skillfully maintained;
the stage-picture was never lop-
sided. A tendenc to overplay in
the more intense rainatic moments
may or may not have been the fault
of direction. It is ossible that this
overemphasis was Lie to the strain

, which always attends amateur dra-

matic interpretation.

The Plot

Denis Geoghelgﬁn (the juvenile
lead) played by bert Kleeb, is the
‘spoiled child, “the whiteheaded boy,”
of his doting family. When for the
third time he fails his medical ex-
amination at the college in Dublin,
his oldest brother and ﬁnancial sup-
Pori. George (George Boggs Jr.).
threatens to send him to Canada,
f°l‘¢"18 him to break his engage-
ment to charming Delia Duﬁy (Bar-
bara Fetterman), daughter of John
Duffy, the village postmaster—-—a de-
termined mai_i—played with Irish
Vito!‘ and Irish humor by Marty
Fallon. Denis’ family, headed by
his Aunt Ellen—a determined wom-
an, who once rejected John Duffy's
offer of marriage-—played by Zita
Dobernack, who gave a humorous
characterization with most delightful
~finesse. The play shows us how the
clever Denis conquers his irate fam-
ily and once_ again has them giving
Islilrrrei everything he ‘could possibly de-

Women Fraternity Leaders , 
Denounce Pall Rushing    . .

With the close of another fall
rushing season, which, although an
improvement over the one held last
fall, according to Panhellenic Coun-
cil, was’ not a decided success ‘in
that only forty-two out of eighty
eligible. girls were pledged, the
question bf the: advantage of a fall
rushing -season has .once more
arisen._ The opinion that two peri-
ods a year for rushing is undesir-‘
ablefis, becoming more and more
widespread, according ‘to. the state-
ments of a number of campus lead-
ers.
Sarah Drum, president of_ Pan-
hellenic, commented on fall rushing
as being.“a ‘waste of time. money
and energy.” "This year.” she con-
tinued, “Panhelleni'c--(‘ouncil mailed
sixty-one ,_bids, forty-two of which
were accepted by the. rushees. This
indicates to me that each year the
trend is away from mid-year rush-
ing. Considering that the schedules
of four hundred girls were dis-
turbed, and -their routine’ upset to a
great degree, it seems to me that‘
fall rushing is foolish."

A similar opinion was expressed
by Naomi Ericson, vice president of
W S G A.: '

“I” believe that -fall rushing should
be abolished entirely. There are not
enough girls eligible for rushing in
the fall to iustify the expense that
a two-day rushing period means.

UE TO TWO typographical errors in our column last
week, some of the students were at a loss in decipher-
ing my method of deriving ou_r percentage with regards
to the predictions on the varsity football games. There-
fore, in order to set the students right and to prove to
them that we are not trying to pull the wool over their
eyes, we will repeat what we meant to say last week.

Ever Saturday, each member of the sporting staff
of the New York Daily News predicts the possible out-
come of the ﬁfteen outstanding football games in the
country that day. The best percentage of any writer

 4 for picking winners of the games is but a little over

gsgventy per cent while this same writer’s percentage for picking the right

i .acore is but 58.3. Our percentage for picking the right scores up to the

-, ’‘Pitt-Oh_io State game last Saturday was 66.4 per cent. .

‘ f‘,c';To figure out the percentage of the correctness of the scores, we
 the difference in the scores between the two teams by tile difference
. between them as we predicted it. In case the latter difference is less than

i the former one, we simply shift the two ﬁgures in our calculations.

_

 ~ We add the quotientof these two numbers tohthe quotient
I derived by dividing the total number of points which we predicted
 g-would be scored by the actual number scored by both teams, or
‘ ‘vice versa. We divide the sum by two and that gives us our
percentage. * , I _ .
4 There. are several troublesome situations which arise as a
result of this system. One occurs when neither team scores and
the other blossoms forth when we pick the wrong team to_v_v1n.
 The Nebraska gamelis an example of the ﬁrst condition. We
 «picked,-the Panthers to win, 14-0, but the result of the game was
' a scoreless tie. There are three possible answers. One is Inﬁnity,
another is one-half inﬁnity, and the last is zero. The average of
thesethree gives us one-halt‘ inﬁnity. But to make matter pre-
sentable, we merely took 50 per cent for our efforts and called
it a day. We're big hearted that way.
The game with Ohio State last week is an example of the
other possible tangle that may arise. In such a case, we add the
diﬁerence between the two teams at the end of the game to the
difference which we predicted. We divide this into the. difference
which we predicted to ﬁnd one-half of our result. Here is the way
we ﬁgured it out; (7-16 plus 7-23) divided by two equals 273-736
or 37.1 per cent.
. Our average for our redictions for the seven games whose
results we have attempte to guess beforehand is 62.2 per cent,
an average which is still better than that of anyone of thc.pro-
fessiotnai sports writers for the New York Daily News. Mail all
.~ : compliments to the Pitt Weekly office. Nothing less than twenty
2 dollar gold pieces will be accepted. ‘
—-———-o—--—

OSFI‘ OF THE leading football teams in the. country will
bring their seasons to a close this Saturday and the
week-end card is chuck full of traditional battles be-
tween old rivals. Without a doubt, the most important
game scheduled over the week-end is that between
Notre Dame and Northwestern. Both teams have

' cleaned up all their opponents to date and the schedule
of each team shows that very few teams which could
properlybe called setups were played this year.

Notre Dame‘ has scored victories over Southern

. Methodist, Navy, Carnegie Tech, Pitt, Indiana, Penn,

V  . and Drake, while the Wildcats have been victorious over
Tulane, Ohio State, Illinois, Centre, Minnesota, Indiana and Wisconsin.

- f h teams will enter the game without their regular fullbacks, Jumping
*  Savoldi having quit school as the result ‘of marital troubles, with Pug

Bgontner of the I-Ianley brigade being forced to the sidelines with a

 shoulder.

A I

____of__

The edge in this game appears to be with Notre Dame, at
least from this angle. The Irish regulars have not been used up as“

 much as ‘those of Northwestern and they have not been subject _
~-to the hard luck injuries the same way as the Illinois boys have
been. The Irish regulars have also had more leisure moments
during their games due to Rockne’s great preserve strength while
‘the Northwestern team can boast of few capatble substitutes.

The latter factleads me to believe that the Irish will win by
two. touchdowns. The score will be around‘ 21-6. And in case you
would like to learn the results of other important games, well,‘

7 here they are.

UST  MORE weeks to go and then Pitt basket-

ball fans will have another chance to see a, Pitt ﬂoor
team in action, as the Panthers will open their season

_ on the stadium court when‘ the Western Reserve team

comes to Pittsburgh on December. 8.

W The_ team will then make its annual jaunt through
the m1_d-West. but Instead of playing ‘.‘Big Ten” schools
exclusively as has been the custom heretofore, only

one Western Conference school, Ohio State, will be met

on the trip this year. The other teams which will be
met by the Panthers are Marquette, Creighton, and Ne-

 , braska. _The Panthers will then return home to face

Dartmouth, Syracuse, Indiana, and Purdue in the order named. The Pan-

there will then go to New York for a game with the Violets on January

' 10, after which they will return home or games with Fordham, West

f Virginia, and Carnegie Tech.

 

......._o._.....

V Notre Dame and Was -Jeff are ‘next on the schedule with
games abroad. The Irish w l repay the Pitt visit with a return
.~-ﬁganie here, February 7. Th Carlson team will then go to New
«York for two games with,Army and City College of New York.
Penn State, Carnegie Tech and Wash-Jeff are the next opponents,
‘ . all these teams being met in Pittsburgh. The game with Wash-Jeff
« will close the Panther home season, but three more games will be
played abroad before ﬁnis is written, to the 1930-1931 campaign.
Games with Penn, West Virginia and Penn State, at Phila-
delphia, Morgantown, and State College, respectively, will wind
up the schedule. .

 

.__..o...._..

It would be asking too much of the Pitt boys to wish them to go

_through their schedule undefeated since they lose Charley Hyatt, Les
Cohen, and Paul Zehfuss from last year’s team, but as usual Carlson may
be expected to present a strong front at every game and the Panthers
should complete their sche e with not ‘more than six losses.

’ . Coach Carlson has inve ted a new offensive system, which he claims
will defeat any team in the country provided that it clicks. “Red” has
always been noted for being optimistic, but this is one time that we’re

‘ hoping he is simply telling the truth.

Alhlelic Council Denies
Tenth Game Rumor

Branding the newspaper
story of a Pitt post-season
game with either Duquesne or
W. and J. as unfounded, the
Athletic Council denied all
meetings claimed by the news-
paper and stated that no plans
were being made for such a
game. The Athletic Council
issued the following statement:

“The Athletic Council of the
‘University of. Pittsburgh is de-
sirous of ‘helping to the fullest
extent the cause of charity. It
believes that the community’s
big opportunity is to support,‘
whole-heartedly and exclusively,
the Carnegie-W. and J. football
game, rather than split interest
between that game and another.
-Therefore the Athletic Council
has decided not to" play a post-
season game which might con-
flict with the charity game al-
ready scheduled between Car-
negie and W. and J., and to
place at the disposal of the com-
mittee arranging that game, not
only the Pitt Stadium, but all
the resources of the Athletic
Department and the support of
the University of Pittsburgh.”

Frosh Grid
Team Ends
Cog Year

State Freshmen Bow
' To Pitt Yearling:
In 1930 F inale,

Combining a smashing attack
witha few aerial onslaughts, a ow-
erful band of Panther year ings
brought their football season to a
successful close last Saturday af-
ternoon at State College by trounc-
ing the Penn State freshmen to the
tune of 12 to 0. State's offense was
stopped dead by the hard tackling
of the Pitt Frosh and at no time
did they threaten to score. Despite
the loss of an even hundred yards
through penalties, the Panther Cubs
outgained their opponents decisively,
piling up a margin of 12 to 1 in first
downs and completing a quartet of
forwards which were good for 85
yards.

The State ‘Plebes, however, pre-
sented a game team that staved off
defeat until the ﬁnal period when
Pitt’s crushing attack began to
function properly and effectively.
With only eight minutes to play,
Sebastian broke the ice by racing 30
yards down the side lines for a
touchdown after grabbing a 15-yard
heave from Simms. Matesic added
another soon afterwards with a neat
jaunt through tackle from the 15-
yard stripe. Both tries for the extra
point ‘failed.

Gougler Efficient

The success of the Panther fresh-
man football teams during the last
two years has been due to the able
and efficient coaching of “Skip”
Gougler. Skip came to Pitt three
years ago and since he took over
the reins of the Plebe squad, he
has had plenty to do with the shap-
ing and grooming of Pitt mainstays.
Coach Gougler is a former Panther
gridder- and team mate of Pitt's
great mentor, Jock Sutherland.

Last fall Coach Gougler’s pro-
teges lost but one encounter and
that was a careless decision to the
Carnegie Tech Plebes. Thisseason
his team has scored victories over
the Frosh of George Washington,
West Virginia, and Penn State, while

Carnegie Tech managed to‘ hold-

them to a 0-0 deadlock. , Their lone
setback resulted at Johnstown on
Armistice Day when Plummer, Kiski
Prep tackle, booted a 20-yard place-

ment- in - the~ waning moments of ~ the

battle to give his side a 9-6 triumph.

The little Panthers, as a whole,
displayed ﬂashes of powerful foot-
ball at times and steady improve-
ment was noticeable as the season
progressed. The material on hand
this fall was exceptionally good and
would have gladdened the heart of
any coach. Several of the boys
gained considerable recognition and
notoriety on their respective high
school or prep school teams before
coming to Pitt.

Strong Linemen

Love and Onder, Jeannette High
luminaries, were towers of strength
on the line. Both are big and fast
and would look good in a varsity
position next fall- Other outstand-
ing linemen were Meredith, Belle-
fonte Academy; Hartwig, Benwood
High, W. Va.; Gelini, Weirton High,
W. Va., and Big John Valenti, 250
pounds of humanity, from Media
High near Philadephia.

At the terminals, Coach Gougler
had such ﬁne wingmen as Skladany,
Larksville High; Vincent, Sioux
City; Timmons, Allegheny High,
and Craft, New Castle High. ’

By JERRY FRIEDMAN

This is a mere reporter, trying to
write a little news for the Pitt
Weekly readers. While I was in Co-
lumbus cheering for our ferocious
Panthers, I espied many Pitt nota-
bles. W. Don Harrison was min-
gling in the huge crowd and he
looked as serious as ever. Jess Car-
ver and Ralph Davis were up in the
Press box writing about the down-
fall of our Pitt team. '

Of course, James “Whitey” Hagan
was there and I bet he was thinking
if only he was in the game so that
he could help our downtrodden team.
Though there were only 48,000 peo-
ple at the game, it was not Fred
Turbyville’s fault. He worked hard
on the publicity end. He also took
statistics on the different yardage
gained or lost by by both teams‘.

Oh, yes, I saw our famous an-
nouncer, Sub-Station B-E-N-C-H

Coed Championship Decided
By 10-2 Win Over Frosh -_

In a one-sided game Tuesday af-
ternoon, the women’s sophomore
hockey team defeated the freshmen
by a ten to two count, thereby
clinching for themselves the cham-
pionship of the 1930 season.

Led by Billy ‘Hoar, ﬂashy right
“wing player, the freshmen opened

put them in the lead early in the
game with a two to one score. How-
ever, the sophomores crawled up to
tie the score early in the second
quarter and continued to roll up
‘points, overwhelming the ﬁrst-year
coeds with rush attacks. The fresh-
man defense was so strong during
the entire game that the sopho-
mores.~succeeded.. only through hard
shots in ‘the striking A circle. , ,
The championship comes to the
sophs after victories over the sen-
iors, three to one; juniors, eight to
two, and in this game the fresh-
men, ten to two. The sophomore
lineup includes Olive Johnston, cen-
ter forward; Helen Weideli, right
inner; Charlotte Mady, left inner;
Anna Mae Brodmerkel, right wing;
Evangeline Jaffurs, left wing; Mary
Kpvacs, center half; Dolly Hoban,
right half; Jane Walton, left half;
Anna Mae Wetzel, right forward;

the hard hitting and shifty Matesic
of Bellefonte Academy. Matty, as
he is_bet_ter known, can also toss
the pigskin with the best of them.

later of the Kiski Prep colors; Mike

ing. staff, Morris Cohen, was sitting
near Coach Sutherland and waiting
for the opportunity to advise “Jock.”
In backaof me, I could hear John St.
Peter yelling “Beat Tech,” too bad
that he was behind times. My dear
roommate was telling a State man
that Pitt would score three touch-
downs in the last quarter, and Paul
Friedman was backing him with the
“mazuma.” Leaving the Ohio sta-
dium, I recognized the familiar fig-
ure of Fred Lucas. He was walking
with head bent down. I, too, was
sorry that Pittsburgh lost, for as
the Panthers did so did I and this
week I stay in nights. But my sor-

rows were forgotten, for that night 9

I would go to the frat dances and

Buckeyes Defeat
Pitt At Columbus

An inspired Ohio State eleven
evened up matters with Pitt for the
defeat handed them last year and
turned in a 16-7 triumph over the

Golden Panthers last Saturday at.

Columbus before a crowd of ﬁfty
thousand.

Led by their brilliant A1l-Ameri-
can, Captain Wes Fesler, thé Buck-

eye team displayed a brilliant aerial
attack and scored a touchdown in
the ﬁrst quarter, kicked a placement
goal in the second period, and again
crossed the Blue and -Gold goal line
in the third quarter. Pitt scored
her only touchdown in the third
quarter when Paul Rieder rounded
the Buckeye end and was tackled
after a gain of ﬁfty-four yards. The
ball was then advanced to the one
yard line where Hood plunged over
for the score. ‘

Lou Hinchman, son of the veteran
Pirate scout, along with’ Larkins,
Ehrensberger, and Fesler were the
big guns of the Ohio machine, while
Captain Eddie Baker, Tully, and
Rieder .\ played brilliantly for the
Panthers.

State Team
Plays Here
’Turl_<_e_y Day

Nittany Lions’ Have
Lost Three, Tied
Two This Year

With its team compiling only a

 

fair record this year, Penn State will

enter its Thanksgiving battle with
the Panthers a decided underdog.

Penn State has not defeated a
Pitt team since 1919, and its record

of three games won, three games

lost,.and, two games tied this year,
makes it seem unlikely that it will
turn ‘the trick this season.
' Penn State has not won a major
game. this year. After crushing
their ﬁrst three opponents, all wea
and minor teams, the Lions have
been able to get only two ties dur-
ing the rest of their schedule.
Lose Three
Colgate, Bucknell and Iowa have
each. humbled Penn State, by the
scores of 40 to 0, 19 to 7 and .19 to 0,
respectively, while Syracuse and
Lafayette have held the Nittany
Lions to ‘scoreless ties.
A very weak line has handicapped
the Lions throughout the season.
The backﬁeld was touted earlier in
the season as one of the best in the
country, and ‘although it has hardly
lived up to this reputation, it has
formed a constant. scoring threat.
Cooper French, speedy back who

' threw such a: scare into Pitt fans

last year by his brilliant work, is
the outstanding star of the team.-

Diedrich, another back who played
magniﬁcently against Pitt last year,
is captain. Diedrich has never
reachedghis form of last yearand
he has been a great disappointment
to the Lion rooters.
0' Ends Strong

Lasicli, who hails from Clairton,
has done well at the fullback post,_
offensively l and defensively.
Gillerd, also from Clairton; has been
the best in the line, playing effi-
ciently, if not spectacularly. ‘Ed-
wards and Kaplan, ends, have‘ been
rarely outplayed and give Penn
State an excellent pair of wingmen.

The FAVORITE

tobacco of the

IF you want to know the Dari’.-

watch him as he loads his pipe be-

Last Saturday at Columbus the
Panthers’ letdown was quite evi-

their business as though they. en-
joyed every play and couldn’t wait
for the next scrimmage to start.
Pitt seemed to be anxious to get

and showed the bio fol s some

‘ good football.

 

Sutherland gave the boys tw
days of rest this week and expects
to have them on edge. once more
for the Penn State bunch. Theold
November winning punch was not in
evidence last week, but that little
thing will be regarded as a slip of
fortune, and the State boys will
have to pull a Notre Dame‘ act if
they hope to spoil the Panther’s

tosses in practice and it wouldn’t be
surprising to see State smothered
by a fast and furious barrage of
passes. But anyway, passes or no

- not so peaceful victims. -

still be rolling up points, but this
year he will do his starring out in

and s Cohen have a so been seen
for the last time as Charley’s.scin-
tilatling playmates,.and their efforts
will be missed almost as‘ much as
the Chipper’s. But things look
plenty bright for a mighty ﬁne sea-

Although having no active par-
ticipants on the major teams at Pitt
this year, the Medical Schodl is do-
ing its share to make Pitt success-
ful in athletics. For the last few
years, the doctors have had at least
one representative on the football
team, but this year they are assist-
ing in the coaching duties. No less
than three of the most famous play-
ers ever to play on Pitt teams are
among the future-doctors. Most fa-

his letter.

Donchess Stars

Because of his remarkable high
standard in his studies, Joe was ‘one
of the few students who was able
to make the Medical school in two
years. After entering the Medical
School, Joe continued to play foot-
ball. During his second year on the
squad, he was one of the leading
players.

In 1929, Joe enjoyed a banner
year. From the beginning of the
season, experts boomed him as an
All-American. Before the season
was more than half over; it Was
freely predicted that he wasa sure
bet for one of the end positions on
the team. The outstanding game of
iIoe’s whole career was the game
a
played opposite his fellow towns-
man, Wesley Fesler. _

Fesler had made an All-American
place the year before and was ex-
pected to be the
real Show at the
game. Then J.oe

- Kowallis Coach, . _

Althouglilnot quite as well known
as Donchess, -George Kowallis also
has done his share for Pitt in ath-
letics. George graduated from Du-
quesne High ‘in 1923 and was one
of the best basketball players ever
to leave that institution. Like ‘Don-
cliess, George also had an ambition
to_ become a doctor. He. entered
Pitt in the fall of 1923‘and came
out for the freshman team that
year, but he had ‘a tough time of it.
, Although he did make the squad
he failed to holda regular berth. In
his sophomore year, however, things
were diﬁerent. George ‘surprised
everybody, including Coach Carlson,
when he beat every ody-else out for
a forward position. George contin-
ued his ﬁne work the next two
Yea-TS. having an especially great
season in 1927. His greatest. game
was the game with the Michigan
champions of the Big Ten that year.
George helped Pitt down the Big
Ten boys by making eight field
goals and playing a commendable
game on the defense. Pitt won the
game 38 to 23.

After graduating -from the col-
lege, George entered Medical_~school.
In need of a freshman coach for
the basketball team that year, Coach
Carlson decided that George could
handle the job. Dr. Carlson has
never_ regrettted that move, for
George has made a remarkable rec-
ord since he took over the reigns of
the little Panthers.

His string of- consecutive victories
runs close to ﬁfty games, and he has
had two undefeated, teams. George
isn’t the only representative from
his family to play for the Pitt team
because he» has two» younger broth-
ers, Billy and Steve, who played for
the vars_ity.18-St year. ; ‘ Both boys are
expected to be regular cagers this
year.

. Zehfuss Popular

Last but not least of the three
athletically inclined doctors, is “Poi-
son” Paul Zehfuss. Paul~learned his
basketball at South Hills‘High in
Pittsburgh.. In his ﬁrst year at Pitt,
Paul was teamed up with the great
Charley Hyatt as -
a forward on the
"freshman team.
In the next three
years‘ Paul
played a brilliant ,
game and only
wa s overshad-

  

himself. Al-
though not hav-
ing been chosen
a coach to date,
now that the bas-
ketball season is here, it is almost
a sure bet that he will be nominated
by Carlson to assist him, in a few
days. Besides being quite «an ath-
lete Paul is quite popular among his
Medical school comrades, having
been elected treasurer of the fresh-
man class.

Outﬁt Back Next Year

When Pitt's cross-country team,
garbed in colorful long-sleeved gold
jerseys, takes the ﬁeld next Octo-

ber, it will probably be represented
by the best team which has upheld
the Panther name in that sport
since 1924, when Coach Frank
Shea’s harriers won the intercollegi-
ate title. Captain Byb Caesar's will
be the only face missing «when the
1931 varsity hits its stride, for he
ended three years of varsity compe-
tition at the Intercollegiates in New
York City last Monday.
Captain-elect Glenn Thiele, John
Clise, Anthony Mazzei, John Smoy-
er, Theodore Tapp and Marius San-
ticola. will all be back next fall.
They were regulars on this year’s
varsityiwhich won two out of ﬁve
meets, a better record than Pitt har-
riers have turned in for the past
four years. Thiele, Mazzei and
Smoyer have one more year to go,
but the other three will get two
more years of running. These six
lettermen will run into stiff opposi-
tion for varsity positions from a
few of this year’s frosh team. Eisen-
bart, Watkins, Keller and Lawrence

'‘ will be forcing them to the limit.

A, humdinger ﬁght for number
one position should develop next
year among Clise, this year’s var-
sity best, and Eisenbart and Wat-
kins, who tied to break Gus Moore’s
three-y r-old record for the Schen-
ley Par freshman course. Watkins
jogged in with Eisenbart against
Carnegie Tech Plebes in 14:37 2-5
for a close to three-mile run two
weeks ago. 1'

‘ Eisenbart 3rd In New York

Last Monday at the Intercollegi-
ates in New York, Walt Eisenbart
ran third against thevbest "ﬁrst-year
men of the country, covering a
three-mile -‘course _ in 14 :57. « His run-
i’un_g’inate, Watkins, ‘a national A.
A.lJ. place winner in the 1,000 yards,
was ineligible for the New York" run
due to this achievement. The pair
should_'do plent next fall!

Records_.for tiis year, on the var-
sity,_ show victories" over Allegheny
and Carnegie. Tech and defeats at
the hands of Ohio State, Penn State
and Syracuse. Captain Caesai-and
Clise ran in the Intercollegiates,
both covering a slow, rnuddy‘six-
mile course in better than 34 min-
utes. -_It may well be, noted that
two of Pitt's conquerors, Penn State
and Syracuse, won team "champion-
ship and runneru ilonors at the
races Monday. Pitt certainly faces
the best in the nation in cross-coun-
try ingits dual meets. , _

The fresh, represented‘ by Eisen-
bart, Watkins, Platt, Keller, Law-
rence, May, Kunz and Carick,
trimmed Schenley High, Penn, State
and Carnegie, losing only to the na-
tional championship outﬁt, Syra-
cuse. Schenley and Carnegie Plebes
wegeswamped by perfect scores.
Three victories out of four is an
enviable record. ,

Next year, Penn State ‘will be
minus the services of their trio of
star performers and Pitt may se-
cure its ﬁrst varsity cross-country
victory’ over the Nittany Lions. The
Orange _of Syracuse should be just
as strong as this year and the only
team to beat the Panthers next year.

in the coming season, a trip to ‘New
York for the full ‘team’ will be well-
earned the ﬁrst time in,four years.

Well, Wesley Fesler and his
teammates took the victory pigskin
away from us last week after Cap-
tain “Eddie” Baker promised to
give me the ball if we won. Every-
thing seems to look “queer” to me
about that game. For one thing the
Law of Averages was working on
us. You know that we were de-
feated twice in 1926 and 1928, and
that we had undefeated. seasons in
192.7 and 1929. _ So you can see for
yourself that since this is an even
year, we were doomed to defeat by
that Law. .Well, 8nYW9»Y. It P1’?-
dicts an undefeated season for us
next year. Another thing was that
“Jock” predicted two defeats for us
this season, and I guess he didnt
want people to say that he _was ad-
dicted to telling “bear” stories. And
another thing, “Bob” Remaley (cos
sports editor) failed me. I had
told him what to whisper in -“Jock-’s’
ear, as I had to sit in thepress box
and speak over the radio to my pub-
lic. It seems that “Bob” got so
excited that he. couldn’t say 8 Word
in’ a whisper and could onl ‘holler
‘out loud. Not only “Jock” ‘
the Ohio State bunch heard every
word the said,‘ so my I-instructions
couldn’t be carriedout. ‘

Not, With Team

I-didn’t make the trip with the
team at 2:00 o'clock‘ as I had_ two
uizzes the sixth-and seventh hour.
at I went up on the five o’clock ex-
cursion, and some one} who recog-
nized me let it "get around, and I
had-to‘ go into every coach and tell
some of . my personal experiences
while‘ playing on my high. school
team. I don’t like to brag about
myself but I’1l.tell you 8- little psy-
chology that I used in the big‘ game
of the year against our bitter rivals,
and which I told‘ the bunch about in
coach 3. It was in the last quarter
and we were getting beat 3-0, and
it looked. like we were never going
to score. 'But‘I had been studyin’
the fellows on the other team, an
I noticed that when one of them
made a. good play they always
Ipokedovcr to a red haired-girl sit-
t n

in thestands. So when one of

their fellows carried the ball, I said,-

“Look, Ruth is callingto you.” He

dropped. the ball and started over‘

to her side, but I didn’t pick up the
ball right away as ‘I knew _there
were ten other men toget rid of.
Instead,'I yelled to the other fel-

lows that the halfback was beating '

their time. They all dashed over to
mob him, and then I_ picked u the
ball, and ‘raced down thefﬁel un-

molestcd for the touchdown that
won the game. Thefpeople in the
coach were astounded at my reason-
in , but one irl had to pipe up, and
as, me how if knew the girl’s name
was Ruth. (Some people always
take the joy out of -life.)

Close Season Soon

Well, we closethe season Thanks-
giving Day against our traditional
rivals, Penn State. It means a rest
for most of the fellows on the team,
but not for me and Eddie Baker as
we have to start practicing basket-
ball right away But right now, we
two are thinkiii of football and
beating State. Personally, I, don't
think ’ we'll have much trouble
against them, but I am afraid the‘
boys are ; liable to. be a. little too
conﬁdent, but me and “Jock” are
going to try and suppress this feel-
in .- .

one of the downtown papers picked

‘ Hanky History

But what’s in a handkerchief, you
ask?- Was a time, you know, when
the handkerchief was an indispensa-
ble note in women’s fashions, when
it lent just the desired chic to la
femme. And back in the elegant
eighties, a coquettish miss grace-
fully allowed her kerchief to swirl
to the ﬂoor, and a half dozen gal-
lants fairly crushed themselves in a
mad dash to restore it to her. Just
as there once was such romance in
the kerchief, so each of the two or
three suit cases of them that Dr.
McKov_vn owns, has an interesting
narrative about it.

It all happened like this: One
day the topic for discussion in his
Education 61 course was “apprecia-
ti0}i,’_’ and to aptly illustrate his
point, the_ Doctor exhibited several
handkerchiefs. The students were
asked to designate the examples
which appealed to them and to spec-

Pitkin Club Fosters.
‘Johnstown Chapter

Viers Adams, graduate last year’s

president of Pitkin Club, non-de-
nominational religious society, has
organized in Johnstown Junior Col-
lege a new branch of the society,
thefourth chapter in Pennsylvania.
Over thirty members attended the
«opening meeting.
All students, regardless of reli-
gious sect, are invited to attend the
meetings of the Pitt society. Mem-
bers meet outside Alumni Hall at
12:30 every Friday. Club’s regular
quarters, the basement of the Shady-
side Presbyterian Church. The
topic for this week’s meeting, “What
is the Christian Conception of Man,”
will b- discussed under the direction
of Reverend Robert Steele.

The topic chosen for general dis-
cussion next year deals with campus z

tigating this subject is being chosen

McKowr'i Collects Hankies

ify the reasons for. their’ selection.
When the class had‘ adjourned, a
member of the class graciously fa-
vored the instructor with ,a. brightly
colored kerchief with these words:
“Here’s another to add to your col-
lection.” Which, you may easily
conclude, led Dr. Mcliown to a con-
scientious interest for these articles.
That was ﬁve years ago.

Now, on that one particular day,
itis not two or three handkerchiefs
that Dr. McKown exhibits, but a
multifarious collection, such as the
endless stream of them that a ma-
gician unravels from the cup of his

band.
From London

Dr. McKown approximates the
number of handkerchiefs in his col-
lection between 200 and 250, and
“more and more keep coming in ev-
ery day,” he says. There are speci-
mens from every nook and corner
of the world. It is a veritable
league of nations packed together in
a suitcase. There are gorgeous lace
kerchiefs from old Ireland, a. hand-
painted one from Hungary, a Lon-
don product designed from six ﬂags,
gay, colorful squares from China
and Japan, from Russia, Switzer-
land and Mexico. _

Among the more interesting parts
of the collection is a handkerchief
with a hand portrait of a onetime
lady friend; one that took a prison
convict six years in the making, and
still another that-“reveals the artist-
ry of Dr. McKown himself, em-
broidering his initials at four.

And so, if perchance a distinc-

tive pose-wiper comes your way‘.

with an apparent utility for any-
thing but nose-wiping—-Dr. McKow_ni

will be delighted to add it to his

now extensive collection of hankies.

the nature of a get-together for all
former and present students of the
Center.

The auditorium of the Johnstown

mittee; Sygmund Kaminsky of the
reception committee and Marjorie
Werry and Katharyne Lynn of the
publicity and entertainment com-
mittees, respectively. '

with coats unbuttoned and wearing
colored ties, and one was reported to

Action awaits if they beat the
sophomores in football. Meanwhile

More than 75 positions -that stu-

As,.]erry Recovers From
Serious Sick Spell

J'erry,.the popular mascot of
Heinz House is recovering from
an illness.

He was under the weather

{last week, and according to
Mrs. Foster, refused to eat. His
symptoms were so serious that
he was almost sent to the hos-
pital. He. is all right now,
however, except that he shows
a tendency to sleep.

He came out to say “hello”
to us at Mrs. Foster’s command,
but apparently we did not ap-
peal to him and he returned to
his box after one inquisitive
glance.

Mrs. Foster has had Jerry for
four yqnrs an is very much at-
tached to him, as are all the
habitues of Heinz House.

By J. D. PAULCS

“Honi Soit” may be just the be-
ginning of another college yell to
us but to the students of the Sidney
(Australia) University it is a ﬁne,
six-column week paper. “Honi
Soit,” as you ma have guessed,
came to the exchange department of
our paper, and was subject to an
immediate journalistic vivisection
by the members of the staff.

Two large advertisements on the
front page of the paper bear evi-
dence to the fact that Volsteadism
has not been accepted in Australia.
One, in the left hand ‘corner, adver-
tises the Uni. Hotel» and— says “Best
Ales and Spirits Always on Tap.”
The other, near the bottom of the
sheet, reads, “That Beautiful,’ Soft,
Fruity Flavour Lingers Long in
Penfold’s Wines.”

The paper, in direct contrast to
our own Weekly, discusses at length,
and with apparent weight of opin-
ion, problems of world politics. An
“International Outlook” and “World-
Wide Justice” are given prominent
positions on the sheet. An immense
article on the causes of war writ-
ten by oneof the. faculty members
has the center column. ~

Sports, furthermore, form a deﬁ-
nite part of the paper. Only where
the Weekly would have an immense
football article “Honi Suit”, makes
much ado about a cricket match, won
from Paddington. University ' by a
score of two hundred ﬁfty-eight to
nothing. The captain of the team
was headlined to have made .117

points alone. (Maybe they'd like to

 

 llegians

come up here and play us ping-pong
some time.)

Movies, and sound movies, too, are
the rage of the college Romeos. At
any rate, an Australian theatre
found it to its advantage to adver-
tise the “Careless Age” with Doug-
las Fairbanks, Jr. It is apparent
that “dates” do not always include
merely cricket matches. But then
how-= are they to know the prices
when they’re written 1/; and 5/.
Trigo-algebraic geometry is neces-
sary to determine how much in ac-
tual dollarsand cents.

Dash and Deah!

The “Scanda_.ls” section of the
paper reads: “A few days ago we
heard that Miss Lorna Hodge is en-
gaged to Mr. Baine Dash. Lorna,
as all graduates and undergradu-
ates will remember, had a brilliant
university career and at the ter-

mination of her arts course she
joined the ranks of the teachers.
Baine, we hear, is a chemist. We

wish them both happiness and con-
gratulate Mr. Dash most heartily.”

“These and'Those” would proba-
bly have writen: “Lorny Hodge
(remember?) will have it sealed
with Bainy Dash. Dame Rumor
hath it that_Baine is a chem. and
won Lorny via the academic route,
Lorny being a teacher, you see.
'.When’s it happenin’, Dash?”

We missed our “Pitt Pourri” and
“Campus Scout,” but somehow, we
can’t wait until the mailman brings
in another issue of “Honi Soit.” And
by the way, ﬁgure out the name
sometime. No. dictionary gives it.

Results in the Weekly-M. S. Roc-
ereto song contest calling for an ar-
rangement of words to the chorus of
Professor Rocereto’s new musical
composition, “The Cathedral of
Learning March,” have again been
delayed. Thevprocrastination is to
be attributed to the unwillingnessrof
Volkwein Brothers, publishers , of
the march, to accept any of the sets
of words thus far contributed.

‘In spite of the offering of a $10
prize by,Profes_sor Rocereto for the
best/words‘, only ﬁve students have
sent in the stanza which should go
with the tune and tempo /of the
march- According to Volkwein,
none of these sets are suitable. Pre-
vious delays in a deﬁnite announce-
ment were cgused by the illness of
Mr. Rocereto and by the entire clos-
ingof ‘school last June.

The history ofvthe contest dates
back to the time of the University
band’s annual home concert in Car-
negie Music Hall last April. A cam-

A-casual review of the‘ verses re-

for publication left these two ‘con,-

Accordingly, t e Weekly,‘ Profes-

agreed to postpone the ‘closing of
the contest for another full month.

F rick Acre Custodian Claims
Distinguished C onnectious
But Is Very Democratié

Ulysses S. Grant, nightwatchman
at-the Frick -Acres Houses, is a man
of famous connections. Not many
here at Pitt have a history similar
to ‘this_'man’s. Grant is second cousin
to the famous Ulysses S. Grant, one
time President of the United States.
Not only that, but he is also a de-
scendent of both Benjamin and Wil-
liam Harrison, each of whom served
as executive of our country.

‘As though it is not distinction
,enough to be a descendent of three
Presidents, Grant has also been in-
directly connected witli the lives of
two others. , . “

His. father, a soldier in the Civil
War,.was, at the time of Lincoln’s
assassination, placed as guard over
the house in which that great man
died._ Grant, himself, while a small
newsboy, waiting for his papers out-
side the Baltimore and Potomac-‘Sta-
tion in Washington, D. C., on ‘July
2,1881, was ‘one of the few witnesses
to a most tragic affair. He saw
Char1es.J. Guitteau, a disappointed
oﬁice seeker,‘ shoot and mortally
wound James A. Garﬁeld, then
President of the United States.

Ex-Ball Player ‘

Though a house painter by trad
and in spite of his connection with
some of the most eventful times of
American’ history, Grant has a most
common avocation. In fact, one that
almost every man has. It is base-
ball. When the Washington profes-
sional baseball \club was included ‘in
the Eastern League, Grant played
center ﬁeld for one season with
them. .Though not playing at pres-
ent, hefollows the ball scores most
avidly. . _

Not only interested in baseball, he
is one of Pitt’s most ardent rooter»
when it comes to the gridiron. He
even carries Pitt football schedules
of a» few years past in his wallet
along with certain other important
documents.

Grant’s main interest in his pres-
ent job lies in the fact that he’s
always liked to have children around
him, and he sure does like the boys
and girls at Pitt. Most of all the

ones with lots of loose cigarettes.

Frosh Phys. Eds. Love ll!

Twenty-three freshman girls pop
out of bed early on Friday mornings

and skip gaily up to the ﬁeld near‘

Trees Gymnasium, for a bracing
ﬁfteen minutes of hockey. What are
a few.scratches and bruises to
them? They love the game.

These twenty—three hockey enthu-
siasts are freshman girls who are
majoring in Physical Education,
this semester. Many of them have
athletic records from the high
schools, _ They have voted unani-
mously that hockey is more fun
than any other sport, but basketball
is a close second. Their next choice
is tennis. But other activities at
the university also interest them;
seven are writing for the‘ Pitt Week-
ly, ten are member of the Y. W.
C. A. and every last one of them
have joined the W. A. A.

But twenty-three freshmen, no
matter how athletic or how much
they dote on climbing to the gym,
have their difficulties too. ‘These
girls ﬁnd their chief hardships in
getting pictures for their hockey
note-books, keeping one Jump ahead

of hygiene readings and ﬁnding sub-
jects for English composition
themes.

The outstanding pleasures of the

week at Pitt they ﬁnd, are the ﬁf- b

teen-minute recess during‘Zoology
Laboratory periods spent in a re-
union at the drug store,_and the
rather dubious joy ofpwalking every
Tuesday and Thursday all the way
from Carnegie Lecture Hall, up to
Trees gym. Try landing at the top
with a smile yourself, and then say
these athletes won’t make good gym
teachers! -

“Miss Europe,’_’ Greek
Beauty, Coming Here

, Deﬁnite word has been received
by the Greek department that Miss
Alice Diplarakou,_who is Miss Eu-
rope for 1930, will lecture at the

next few months. _

Miss Diplarakou, accompanied. by
her mother, is touring _the United
States at present, lecturing at lead-
ing universities on the subject of
Greek drama. She hasjalready‘ lec-
tured at Columbia University and
at the University of Chicago.

Despite the saying that beauty
and brains do noougo together, Miss
Europe is as intelligent as she is
beautiful. Shespeaks six languages,
including Greek, English, French,
German, Russian and Italian. Re-

 

 

fusing all oﬁ'ers for movie contracts, =

she intends to devote all her time
to education. Miss Diplarakou rep-
resented Greece in the European

lected as Miss Europe.
