Freshman Applications 

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Deadline Closed Early

Due to Increased Size

Applications for this Fall’s
freshman class will be closed
three months ahead of sched-
ule. Applications Will close on
February 28, because of al-
most a 100% increase in the
number of students seeking
admission.

Bernard J. Kobosky, director
of admissions, stated, “Because
of the large number of qualiﬁed

students who already have sought \

admission to the freshman class
at the Oakland campus it would
be unfair to continue to accept
applications beyond that date.”

Applications for this year’s
freshmen class are expected to
exceed 6,500, but only 2,000 fresh-
men will be admitted——“the maxi-
mum. limits we are able to ac-
commodate because of our class-
room and dormitory capacity,”
Mr. Kobosky said. The Universi-
ty has housing space. in Oakland
dormitories for only 400 fresh-.
men men and 350 freshmen wom-
en.

To date, more than 6,200 stu-
dents have sought admission to
the Fall term, compared with 3,-
200 at the same time last year.

Regional campuses at Johns-
town, Bradford, «Titusville, and
Greensburg will continue to ac-
cept applications for another
month or more, although all

Committee Helps
Seniors Become
College Students

All those wishing to apply for
a position on Secondary School
Committee must turn in their ap-
plications in tomorrow at the SU
Desk. 4

The purpose of the Secondary
School Committee is to answer
questions that high school seniors
might have concerning the Uni-
versity. “The committee is only
interested in helping accepted
high school students decide about
the University,” according to Bar-

‘ ry Nudelman, Secondary School

Committee chairmen.

Those students who are select-
ed as members of the Secondary
School Committee will work with
University alumni in an attempt
to meet and talk to the accepted
students. The committee which
will be organized on a regional
basis will function informally out-
side of the respective schools.

As of today, the committee has,
received 160 applications. After
the deadline date (tomorrow),
the various regional committees
will be set up. Some of _the re-
gional committees will begin to
function this trimester, while

. gthers will initiate their opera-, '-

ions - in the it fall.

 

housing space at Greensburg al-
ready has been committed and
that campus is accepting only ap-
plications ﬁ'om commuting stu-
dents.

Transfer student applications
from other colleges and universir
ties will continue to be accepted
at the Oakland campus until ap-
proximately April 1.

According to Mi-.'xobosk_y, the
ﬂood of applications should bring
a dramatic rise in the measur-
able quality of freshman.

Jack B. Critchﬁeld, dean of ad-
missions and student aid and
newly appointed dean of student
affairs, felt that the February
deadline “was the wisest thing to
do at the moment.

“After careful consideration of
the lack of space and the large
number of applicants,” Critch-
ﬁeld continued, “it would be un-
fair to extend the. deadline after
the end of the month.

Housing Problems

ped intoithe previously untouch-
ed area of discrimination in off-
campus housing for students. The
meeting, held Thursday, was the;
ﬁrst business session for the new-
ly-elected officials.

The clause on discrimination
was an amendment to a bill in-
troduced by ﬁve senators to es-
tablish a student committee on
off-campus housing. Loren Her-
shey, who introduced the amend-~
ment and was elected president
pro-tempore for the second year,
stated, “It is the responsibility of
every person to support what
should be the legal rights of all
persons.”

The amendment provides that
the committee formed by the bill
shall have as one of its duties to
“investigate alleged housing dis-
crimination in off-campus hous-
ing and report back to SG.” The
amendment was approved by
vc-te of the Senate.

However, ‘Senator Vic Willem
later suggested that the amend-
ment be struck and be replaced
by a less general clause" specify;
ing exactly what the committee

should do. His proposal was do--.

Smith Lists Reasons

David Smith, assistant to the
vice-chancellor for ﬁnance, issued
the following statement on the
services: “Dormitories function
on our campus as an important
and much needed part of student
life. However, as dormitory main-
tenance is a service, and one
which does not directly beneﬁt

all students, it has been our po-.
licy and'the policy of most uni- i

versities to keep such auxiliaries
on a self-supporting basis.”

Smith pointed‘ out that “be-
cause of rising costs in recent
years, the dormitories at Pitt
have not been self-supporting. In
studying the possibilities for cor-
recting this we found that the‘
excessive cost resulted partly be-
cause we offered substantially
more. maid service than most
other colleges and universities.”

Faced with this situation, Smith
stated that “the administration
chose not to levy a large in-
crease in dormitory fees but de-
cided upon a moderate rent in-
crease and some decrease in serv-*
ice. Some students have objected
that the tuition subsidy for Penn-
sylvania residents now makes it
possible for students to ﬁnance
a large increase for dormitory
costs and thus maintain the pre-
changes in dormitory costs and
sent service.

“However,” Smith explained,
“this view does not recognize that
the state did not provide a tui-
tion subsidy to be used to sup-
port -dormitory and maid serv-
ices far in excess of those pro-
vided at Penn State or at other
institutions in the Commonwealth.
It also was felt that costs to out-
of-state. students should be held
to a minimum.” * ‘

Smith added that “although

. some students might be .-able. to
-so

  

‘d

  
    

that more than -$1 million is need-
ed in National Defense loans and
scholarships for next year indi-
cates that many cannot ﬁnance
costs.”

When asked why the decision
was made at this time, Smith ex-
plained, “This change in dormi-
tory policy was timed to avoid
large lay-offs of personnel. Next
summer, with the opening of sev-

 New Dorm Fees Explained

eral new campus facilities, per-
sonnel no longer needed in the
dormitories can be reassigned to
other duties.” ’
Smith made the point that the
University's. tuition and dormi-
tory fees have remained the same
during the past few years, while
the other area schools, such as
Duquesne and Carnegie Tech,
have had steady price increases.

i“\Wl,1en Does Death Occur?”

Minister Explains Life, Death

Affairs meeting Thursday in the
Student Union Ballroom, Rev.
Hovde attributed the problem to
the need of a new criterion for
death. V

“Most deﬁnitions used are very
bad,” he said. “‘Long sleep,’ ‘over-
lasting life’ are terms used
thoughtlessly by people unable to
cope with the problem.”

Fading also in credibility are
the vital signs long used to de-
termine life or death. “Our iden-
tifying criterion is blurred,” said
Rev. Hovde, “because now with
scientiﬁc instruments we can see
signs of existence after the in-
dividual appears dead.”

Rev. Hovde noted that medical
teams can now restore a heart-
beat and keep a patient biologic-
ally alive, although he might
have complete. loss of contact
with the world. Dr. Hovde raised
the question, “How long should
they be maintained?” “Is biologic-
al existence more important than
consciousness?”

“People are usually glib about

the sanctity of life,” he said, “as

if biological existence must be
kept up at all costs. I personally
don’t agree. If there is a possibil-
ity that the person, although phy-
sically recovering, suffers brain
damage and losses contact with
the world,_ then doctors should
not struggle to keep him alive to
vegetate.” '

Rev. Hovde noted that some
people enter a. hospital wanting

to die, and do so, for no appar-
ent physical reason. These peo-
ple usually are unable to adjust
to the world, consider themselves
failures, or feel that life is use-
less. Physicians who ﬁght against
death, therefore, must take into
account both biological and psy-
chological incapacitation.

“Some theologians,” said Rev.
Hovde, “feel that death comes
even before physical life expires.
Loss of a purpose in life, and
loss of identity means the death
of an individual as a functioning
human being.”

Rev. Hovde feels that today, we
could perhaps talk of ressurrec-

tion of the dead in a special con-
text. If medical personnel work-
ed not only on the biological
maintenance of the dying, but
tried to re-establish hope into
patients, they could progress to-
ward a more complete recovery
of the sick.

. “Does the person have a right
to die if he chooses? How long
should he be kept biologically
alive?” asked Rev. Hovde. “I
think here,” commented Rev.
Hovde, “we are faced with the
same problem as in abortion and
genetic reconstruction of the un-
born.” He also feels that the an-
swers aren't ready.

 Medical Grant Received

The University's School of Medicine has been awarded
a $50,321 grant by the National Fund for Medical Educa-
tion, which will include a new program in biomathematics.
Dr. Lincoln J. Gerende, assistant professor of preven-
tive medicine stated that medical science is finding an in-
creasing need for. the use of mathematics in working_ out

complex biological processes. The
use of mathematical models to
explain bioligic phenomena and
in solving practical problems con-
cerned with living organism has
grown with the years, and by
the use of the computer has
served to accelerate the process
and to sharpen the need for spe-
cialists in the ‘ﬁeld.

Under the proposed program
for the University, the Medical
School would appoint a “mathe-
matician-at-large” responsible for
developing formal course work
for graduate students either in
the basic sciences or for residents
and fellows in related areas. He

would also aid in developing the
curriculum of a contemplated
M.D -Ph.D. program. He would
consult with medical researchers
on applying or developing mathe-
matical models, and would be en-
couraged to‘ pursue research ac-
tivity of his own or with other
faculty.

The program is another step
in the development of the Medi-
cal School "in taking advantage
of the beneﬁts to be gained by

the application of quantitative-

thinking and methods to suitable

problems in medical science.

Brown Discusses Film

Tomorrow at 3 p.m., Gordon Brown, an independent
filmmaker, will speak at a coffee hour in the SU Lower
Lounge. Brown, a graduate of the University, spent 4 years
in the film industry in Pittsburgh and is now living in New
. York where he‘ works as a director and production manager
on documentaries and features while making his own inde-

pendent ﬁlms. The ﬁrst ﬁlm, Hills
Like White Elephants, an adapta-
tion of the Hemingway short
story, was shown at the San-
Francisco Film Festival. His lec-
ture on independent ﬁlm-making
will be in conjunction with the
showing of his 50 minute featur-
ette, The Five of Us,

The Five of Us was shot in
Pittsburgh with local amateur
talent. It was written by Brown
and concerns a depth study of
interpersonal relationships exist-
ing among ﬁve individuals living
on the fringes of a big universi-
ty. Brown’s ﬁlm is one of ﬁve

independently made ﬁlms by _

young experimental ﬁlm-makers.
They will be shown at the Shady-
side Theatre on Feb. 23 and 24
at 1:30 and 3:30 p.m. and on Feb.

For Latin America Program

by PAUL YEAGER
The Isatin American Studies Program which will run from April
26 to August 9 can still accommodate qualiﬁed juniors and seniors
according to Dr. Robert Avery, Department of Sociology, and Dr.

' Carl Beck, Department of Political Science. They have expressed

satisfaction with the present applicants and their‘ choice of topics for
independent study, but hope more people will consider applying. The
deadline for applications has been extended to the ﬁrst week in March.

The objective of the program,
as reported previously, will be to
conduct a comprehensive study
of Latin America through intel-
lectual exchange betwen students
and professors from a Variety of
academic backgrounds. Each stu-
dent will participate in seminars
and will also work under tutori-
al supervision in a program of
independent study which will be
developed out of his own interest
in Latin America.

— , Dr. Avery feels the success of

the program depends greatly on
these topics for independent
study. Therefore, he is urging
students to submit possible top-
ics for independent study not
only for the Latin American pro-
gram using the same interdisci-
plinary technique. ‘V

‘Room Increase
-Questioned

-Editor, The Pitt News:
—Auxiliary Enterprises recently
‘.ai_inounced that it will require a
M 40" per term increase in room
i osts,-effective next fall. Deﬁnite-
__  expenses for the operation of
-the Towers and the Schenley
"Apartments have increased since
,-my freshman year. The question
"ask is why $40 and not $50 nor
31535. ‘The increaseof $80 per year
1-“may not appear excessive at ﬁrst,
but it is. One must remember‘
ithjat there is now another curtail-
‘dent in certain services to the
‘domiitories.

-7 At ﬁrst, it was only the Uni-
ersity Police. Now it is the maid
ervice. Many schools have maid
ervice every other week. Most
_a_.ve.a central linen room, which
,;e-—7alinost had. Pitt is trying to
ecome a better university. It
hould imitate the good qualities

the University to squeeze the up-
perclassmen from the dorms to
make room for the freshmen?
Still a larger proﬁt is made. Are
these funds being used to pay
off the University’s mortgage ear-
ly. or is it being used to pay for
the dorms on the hill? I
Why, after several years of
trying, did the MDC suddenly
get the new social rules passed?
When _did the University of
Pittsburgh’s Trustees approve the
increase? When did the State
.Legislature approve the increase?
_ Mr. Langstaff, these are things I,
and a large segment of the stu-
dent body would like to know."
Why not open the ‘books to us?
Why all the double talk when-
ever we ask questions?
Will Auxiliary Enterprises re-
quire another increase next year,
because the reading period now

 ents in the dormitories. The in-
rease gives the University sev-
eral hundreds of thousands of
«. cllars a year in increased rev-
ienue. Have the operating costs
. M the dormitories risen that
much? I do not feel that a 20
‘pei- cent increase is justiﬁed.,
 uninformed guess concern-_
i,ng'tl'i.e maid’s salary is that at
most they receive $70 a week. A
 earns $140 then. Allowing
increase in pay of as much as
51pe_r week per person, Auxili-
 Enterprises will pay only
:$_l50 a week in salary instead of
$280. The savings here would be"
less if the maids earned less, but
he savings would still be there.

The $40 Bulge

Friday Afternoons in 133CL

by K. Frederick and T. Meisner

Edz'to'r’s Note: As the elected
student representatives, Student
Government President Ken Fred-
erick and Vice-President Tom
Meisner will be writing columns
throughout the year to driscuss
pertinent issues. ‘

The recent increase in dorm
fees coupled with reduction
in maid service was an ad-
ministrative decision made
without student involvement.
After learning of this act, as
the elected student repre-
sentatives, we arranged a
meeting with Assistant Vice-

Chancellor David Smith and -

John Langstaﬂ’ of Auxiliary
Enterprises to discuss possi-
ble alternatives to their
move. '

WE MADE the following
suggestions: a poll to deter-
mine whether the students
wanted-to pay more money
for increased service; option-
al maid service contracted
by students at the beginning
of each term; a forum in the
Student Union to explain
the decision to the students.

We proposed the above

moves after learning that

there was no way of altering
the decision to increase dorm

_ , . A T

1'{0.’the1‘ Schools. but not their    N - fees; the dorms are owned
'.111’€S.- ' ' e i.  the Universit and the
There are thousands of stu- ' ‘ - y y

‘i'-eas\o'ning behind raising
prices stood ﬁrm -—— rising
costs necessitated the action.

While we accept ‘the fact
that the money must be ob-
tained to operate the dorms;
we cannot accept the ap-
proach used by the adminis-
tration in this case, namely,
announcing the decision af-
ter is was ﬁnalized.

AFTER DISCUSSING the
problem with Assistant Vice-
Chancellor Smith, we real-.
ized that the decision to in-
crease dorm fees was a care-
fully thoughtout one. Room
and board costs had not risen

  
 
 

their charges by $200 or
more over the same period of
time. Further, the Tower
dorms had been operating at
a deﬁcit since they were
built four years ago. Labor
costs also have risen.

The necessity for a room-
rate increase thus became
obvious to us. We cannot un-
derstand the reluctance of
the administration either to
include student representa-
tives in the discussions on
this subject before a deci-
sion was reached or to prop-
erly inform the student body
of the rationale behind the
decision.

ON AN issue this coin-

lplex that so intimately

effects the lives of the stu-
dents, decisions must not be
merely thrown at us. We
must be involved in the de-
cision-making process by all
members of the administra-
tion. If we are to properly
represent the students, we
must be included in discus-
sions before decisions are
made. The actual room-‘rate
increase is only part of the
issue. The remainder centers
around the method and atti-
tude employed in both the
decision and its presentation.
We can only hope that the
administration will learn
froin this experience."

on the waterfront
at Annapolis-

growth opportunities for
research engineers

and scientists

The U. S. Navy Marine Engineering Lab-
oratory conducts RDT&E in naval ship-
board and submarine machinery ‘and
auxiliary systems (electrical, propulsion,
control, etc.). In addition to developing
basic improvements in performance and
reliability, the Laboratory concentrates on
ship silencing, new concepts in energy
conversion and control, ways to minimize
friction and wear, special operating ma-
chinery for deep-diving vessels; and tough,
resistant naval alloys to meet all ocean
environmental conditions.

The Laboratory buildings—now more
than 50 of them—house some of the finest
research, experimental and evaluation
equipments of their kind, such as high-
speed computers, electric power generators,
vibration and shock test stands, metals
composition analysis instruments, cryo-
genic storage and handling facilities, phys-
ics and chemistry labs, and complex in-
strumentation for measuring strain, stress,
pressure, acceleration, velocity, perform-
ance, and reliability. -The Laboratory
grounds resemble a modern industrial
park, and include special facilities for
in-field experimentation.

And the locale is ideal. Washington,
Baltimore and the ocean resorts are no
more than one hour's drive. Annapolis it-
self is the state capital, and offers small-
city living with metropolitan accessibility.

Urgent new projects require additional
engineeringand scientific personnel with
BS, MS, and PhD degrees.

Typical Duties of Engineers and
Scientists at MEL:

Mechanical Engineers—-Research and de-
velopment in shipboard propulsion ma-
chinery-pneumatic and hydraulic systems
-—friction and wear equipment and devices
—machinery siIencing—and many other
naval and shipboard mechanical applica-
tions.

Electrical Engineers—Research and devel-
opment in electrical power and its con-
trol—magnetic fields-—ship.control systems

Chemical Engineers—Research and devel-
opment work in chemical and electro-
chemical processes; gas and fluid flow

-systems and equipment; air and water

treatment systems; semi-conductor ma-
terials; lubrication; fuel systems and proc-
esses; filtration; hydraulic fuel systems.
Physicists—Application of physical princi-
ples to the areasof sound, electronics,
optics, mechanics, instrumentation, or
electricity and magnetism. ‘
Chemists—Engaged in application of chem-
ical principles to the areas of water treat-
ment and purification, corrosion and dep-
osition' in naval equipment, atmosphere
purification, thermoelectric materials, fuel
cell power generation, lubrication, fuels,
hydraulic fluids, and instrumental analysis.
Mathematicians—Apply the techniques of
mathematics to the solution of scientific
andyengineering problems in the support
of research and development programs of
the laboratory..Analyze physical problems
and formulas suitable for numerical analy-
sis and computation. Program for solution
by digital computer when appropriate.
Metallurgists—Research and development
work in the area of new ,or improved alloys
for ship hull and machinery applications
involving considerations of physical and
mechanical properties of metals and al-

loys, fatigue and corrosion characteristics, .

and weldability.

Salaries range from $6,387 to $10,927
per year, depending on type of degree and
scholastic standing.

Appointees acquire_ the benefits of career
Civil Service and regular salary increases.

All applicants will be considered on the
basis of merit without regard to sex, race,
creed, color, national origin, age, physical
handicap, marital status, or lawful politi-
cal affiliation.

If you _are interested in applying your‘
capabilities to the vital and expanding
business of improving ship and submarine
performances, arrange with your College
Placement Officer to see the Laboratory's

Another Day

 Mermen Gain Coach;
    Panthers Lose One

lllllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIUIIlllllillllllillllllillIIII

Sports Editor

During the past year, the Athletic Department can best
be characterized as a revolving door. New faces swept in
and some of those swept right back out. -

The most immediate instances occurred this past week-

C ‘ end with one new coach being appointed and another fairly
new one announcing his resignation. The one appointed was
Bill Grant as head swimming coach. The one resigning was

Dick Bestwick, Panther linebacking coach.

Grant comes here after having been the
swimming coach at Mt. Lebanon High
School for the past ten years. He received
his B.S. in education from Pitt in 1950 and
his Masters in 1953. ‘

His credentials are quite impressive
with being the President-elect of the Na-
tional Interscholastic Swimming Coaches _of
America heading the list. Since 1956, he
. has been a member of the NCAA Swimming
and Diving Rules committee for the Interscholastic level.

I

 

 » Announcing the appointment, Frank Carver said, “Bill

comes to us ‘highly recommended. He is well known in the
area and has built up great teams at Mt. Lebanon. In addi-
tion, he -has incurred a national reputation. He has personal
force and character plus technical ability which makes for
 "a great coach. Bill will get the job done.”
In reply Grant said, “No collegiate facility in the coun-
.' -try can match the University’s. I’m not in the habit of
ihmediocrity and I want to give the University a program it
can be proud of.”.
With the selection of Grant, it is obvious that the Ath-
letic Department is determined to give the swimming pro-
 gram a big boost. Recently gymnastics was given the full
steam signal and it looks like swimming was also. With his
cjregiomal reputation Grant should have no trouble attract-
 ing the ﬁnest swimmers in the area to Pitt.
__-_ erry Snyder, the interim coach, will remain as a coach
and instructor in aquatics.
g _ ‘Even though Bestwick was only here for one year, his
l_ea_v1ng 1s a severe loss. for the football program. He is
T going to Georgia Tech as the top assistant to Bud Carson
 the newly appointed head coach of the Rambling Wreck. ’

1 Bestwick and Carson are best friends, having played
their college ball together at North Carolina and serving on
the same coaching staff at South Carolina.

 “I hated to lose him,”\ was Dave Hart’s comment. “It’s
tough to keep good people on your staff.”

 It was rumored that Bestwick was going to take over
qthe offensive planning for the Panthers next year and that
‘Pitt ‘had matched Tech’s salary offer in a effort to hold onto
him. i - .

_: ~ It was Bestwick, who molded Jim Flanigan into one of
the best middle linebackers in the country and who was pri-
Ffma-rily responsible for the signing of Lloyd Weston.

_ T He’s walking into-a golden opportunity in Georgia and
 don’t be surprised_if he’s one of the leading coaches in the

Virginia Past Cagers, 82 - 70

JIM I.aVALLEY
Held. to single point.

“Big John” Naponick suddenly became “Big Bad John”
to the Panther basketball team as he decided to play the

best game of his career before the hometown folks. Na- .

ponick made the difference Saturday in Virginia’s 82-70
victory over the cagers.

, The 6-10, 260 lb. center used his size to dominate every-
thing under both baskets. He scored 23 points on tap-ins, follow up
shots, and stuffs. He held Jim LaValley to one point and just three
rebounds. And “Big John” pulled down 16 rebounds to pace Vir-
ginia’s 47-30 domination of the backboards.

“Their second shot killed us,” said Panther coach Bob Timmons.’

l-Ie offered an excuse for LaValley’s disappointing play. “He was
pressing. He tried to do too much. And Naponick had one of those
games you hope you don’t run into.” 8

Virginia coach Bill Gibson admitted that Naponick usually shares
his job with Norm Carmichael. “But with the game at the Pitt Field
House,” explained Gibson, ffit would have been silly not to start
him. He played some of his best basketball here.”

Naponick put the Cavaliers on the scoreboard with two minutes
gone in the game and not long after Virginia appeared on their way
to an easy win. They opened up a 34-16 margin with seven minutes
left in'the half, but ‘scrappy play by Stan Falenski and Steve Steven-
son forced Virginia to settle for a 46-34 lead at the intermission.

The Panthers carried their aggressiveness over and Falenski
provided the scoring punch. He hit three straight jump shots and
added a free throw to close a 59-49 Virginia edge to 60-56. But two
turnovers proved too costly for the cagers to overcome.

Virginia settled down and made 11 of their last 13 points from
the foul line to preserve their win. -

“We don’t seem to realize the value of possession,_” noted Tim-
mons. “After a ﬁne comeback, we go and lose the ball two straight
times and lose the game.

The two mistakes negated a 28 point effort by Falenski._ “What

we need is Falenski and Ken
wished Timmons. Even if Bol-
lens had had his usual Field
House touch, however, “Big John”
still have to have been consulted
about the outcome.

The swimming team's prowess
was really watered down this
weekend, as it received its worst
beating of the season from Mary-
land, 77-27.

Prior to the-meet, coach Jerry
Snyder warned that the Terapins
would be the toughest club the
mermen would face all season.
Events proved that Snyder'wasn’t
overly pessimistic. 1

The swimmers didn't win a
race until Howie Norris captured
the 200-yard freestyle. In a back-
to-back performance, Joe LeViere
ﬁnished ﬁrst in the ‘following
race, the 200-yard backstroke.

year—206.6. His opponent was

The mermen’s only other ﬁrst
place was recorded when Gene

the 200-yard breast. Maintaining
a little bit of pride was Richie
Norris’ second in the 500 free-
