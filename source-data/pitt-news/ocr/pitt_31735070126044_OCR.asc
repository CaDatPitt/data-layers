University rethinking
outdoor vendors policy

DAVE HARTMAN.
News Editor

Some of the vendors with whom

Pitt ended contracts on Nov. 1 might

return to campus as early as
Thanksgiving, operating under . new
guidelines put forth by a committee
forming to study and make decisions
about vending here.

Others won’t be allowed to come
back at all.

"Pitt held a press conference Friday
to explain its decision to eliminate —

‘perhaps temporarily + the vendors who

operate in front of the William Pitt
Union.

The press conference outlined some
of the reasons for the decision, and for
the first time since vendors were
informed of that decision, suggested
that some might be allowed to return.

ii But that return will be accompanied
by more rigid guidelines than have gov-
erned vending for most of the last two
decades. Those guidelines, which
University spokesman Robert Hill said
Pitt hopes to institute by Thanksgiving,
will be determined by a committee

made up of University administrators.

and .at least one student: Student
Government Board President Jeff Alex.

Alex declined to comment, pending

a meeting with Associate Vice

Chancellor for Business Eli Shorak,
who will head the committee. '

\ And though that committee has yet

to convene, the University outlined

some of those policies in a press confer-

ence.

Returning vendors will be required
to obtain insurance coverage and the
appropriate vending licenses. They will
not be able to vend goods or services in
a way that conﬂicts with Pitt’s contracts
with large companies, such as PepsiCo
Inc. The University has a standing con-
tract with the beverage provider that

prohibits the sale or dispensation of cer- .

tain competitors’ beverage products.

Merchants will also be required to
sell goods that meet “minimum stan-
dards of quality,” and offer products or
services “that are of express interest to
students,” and that maximize the benefit
to the entire“ University community,
according to a University press release.

Hill also said there will be a limit on
the total number of vendors allowed to
participate in the program.

During the press conference, Hill
said the recent decision to oust vendors

U.S. troops settling
into Afghanistan

Los ANGELES TIMES
Staff Report

WASHINGTON — The United
States has put more troops on the
ground in Afghanistan in recent days
and is “settling in for thelong haul,”
Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Sunday.

“Just ‘last night and the night
before, we put in a couple of more
teams,” Myers said on NBC’s “Meet

the Press.” “And the more teams we"

get on the ground, the more effectively
we’ll bring their power to bear on the
Taliban lines.” ' . V
Asked about a recent taped mes-
sage in which Osama bin Laden criti-
‘cized not only the United States but
the United Nations and Arab nations as
well, Myers said, “He’s taking on
everybody. They are the comments of
somebody that is quite sick mentally.”
Noting that he had only read
excerpts of the bin Laden message,

.Myers said the terrorist leaderis “try-

ing to use Islam as his shield, and we
know this is not a war on Islam or

' Muslims. This is a war against terror-

ism. He is a terrorist. And so what I
would say [is] ‘You better move fre-
quently becausg...we’re going to be on

‘ your tail.’’’

’ Myers also said the United States
has no intention of stopping military
action because of the Islamic holiday
of Ramadan, which begins next week.

Saying that the al Qaeda terrorist

network began the war with the Sept.
11 attacks on the United States, he
added, “They chose the time this war
was going to start, and so we’re going
to proceed on this global war on ter-
rorism.”

And he said the United States was »

preparing the Northern Alliance rind
other opposition ' forces to fight
through winter. " .

“The winter is not going to stop us
from doing what we have to do,” he
said. “We are resupplying the opposi-
tion with ammunition, with food, with
blankets, [and] we hope in the not—too-
distant future, with cold-weather gear.
The fighting f_orces...on-our side will
be much better prepared’ for winter
than will the Taliban.”

Myers was also asked about V an
article in The New Yorker magazine by
journalist Seymour Hersh claiming

_that U.S. forces encountered signiﬁ-

cant opposition from Taliban soldiers
in a commando raid Oct. 20, and that
12 Americans were injured, three seri-
ously.

“That’s simply not true. There was
no resistance. The Taliban [ﬁghters]
were in complete disarray,” said
Myers, who ‘estimated that all the sol-
diers involved in the raid were back on
duty. ‘ p

Also Sunday, the Taliban reported
that an American relief worker named
John Bolton died in Afghanistan. A
State Department official said, “We
have nothing on that.”

THE PITT NEWS .

Committee will evaluate  
University vending options

Vendors, page 1

came about because a number of fac-
tors.
Hill mentioned a change in leader-

~ ship within the Office of Student

Activities as one push for a re—evalua-
tion of vending at Pitt. Jack Daniel, now
the interim dean of students — a posi-
tion that oversees the Ofﬁce of Student
Activities —— began working as dean of
students in early September.

Hill also focused on a disorganized
application process and issues of
University liability as forces driving the
change.

“Right now, the process is not
orderly,” Hill said, adding that there is

“no standard for [determining] who may
vend.” '

According to Hill, an unspeciﬁed
number of students have also lodged
complaints about the merchandise some
vendors offer for sale. In response to
those complaints, Hill said, “the new
leadership in student affairs decided to
do something about it.”

The attractiveness of the physical

' environment created by vendors is also

an issue, Hill said.

“Physical facilities and attractive-
ness areissues. We are competing with
major Universities across the country,”
Hill said. “We want attractive infrastruc-
tures, not rickety folding tables.”

_Asked specifically whether some
Pitt administrators prompted the change
because of concern that the vendors
look tacky, Hill said that appearance
was a consideration.

“Nobody in the administration likes

‘g rickety tables,” he said.

Responding to concerns that Pitt
failed to inform vendors of the reason
for their "dismissal from campus, Hill
said the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 hin-
dered a coordinated line of communica-
tion between the school and the ven-
dors.

Hill said that if the Sept. 11 attacks
had never happened, the University’s

' original plan to carry out a more com-

prehensive review of the vendors would
have been put into place, but that con-
cerns for students’ safety and security
after the attacks consumed the time and
resources of the administrative commu-
nity.

Hill stressed that while many vend-
ing guidelines will change, the money
generated by leasing vending spaces
will still go to student programs and
activities, but won’t necessarily contin-
ue to be directed to the Student
Organization Resource Center. A ,

Before vendors were removed from
campus Nov. 1, Pitt proﬁted between
$50 and $100 per vendor per day. That
money funded SORC, which certiﬁes
and assists student organizations at Pitt.

The amount charged to vendors
may also change, Hill said.

Dolly Franzos, who until Thursday
sold jewelry in front of the Union, said
she remains hopeful that Pitt will work
the situation out in the best interests of
everyone involved. Franzos said that
provided the new regulations aren’t
overburdening, she would love to return
to campus. A

But because she barely broke even
on slower sales days, Franzos said she
won’t be able to return if insurance pre-
miums and new University fees are too
high. .

Franzos said that she never imag-
ined the outpouring of student support
that followed the University’s decision

to oust Union vendors. She received
‘ﬂowers, gifts and cards in the mail.

Hill couldn’t specify how the 7

changes will affectspeciﬁc vendors, but
that Pitt’s hope is that vendors “that stu-
dents have come to love over the years”
will return to campus.

— Staﬁ‘ writer Kate Giammarise con-
tributed to this report.

Spontaneity attracts performers

Improv, page 1

1993.
“I go to the Friday Nite Irnprovs all
the time,” said audience member Candi

Feldman. “I ﬁnd it, all so‘ hilarious.”

Feldman said she’s attracted to
improv because she too is spontaneous
and funny. “I think we just sort of attract
one another. It suits my personality.”

One ﬁnal skit put the performers of
the Hat Company in a particularly tight
spot. The performers pretended to be
making a commercial selling horses, but

under the premise suggested by a partic-
ularly cruel audience member perhaps
still annoyed over being forced to partic-
ipate in the earlier Charades game, the
horses’ appeal come from their sexiness.

/As if that wasn’t enough, after one 30-
second skit, the commercial bad to be
retailored to appeal to the midget demo-
graphic, and a third attempt had to
include celebrity spokesman Gary
Coleman.

“It’s not always easy,” Ellis said. \

“But sometimes that’s what makes the

V audience laugh the most.”

Off—year elections still make a
difference, but only if you vote

Did you realize that tomorrow is
Election Day?

Although the election has received
some coverage in recent weeks, other
important events — such as the war on ter-
rorism — have overshadowed it. Although
this is an off—year election — meaning that
there is not a presidential election, no regu-
larly scheduled Congressional elections,
and gubernatorial elections in only Virginia
and New Jersey — it still has important ram-
iﬁcations. ’

This Tuesday, Pittsburgh voters will

‘cast their ballots for, among others, mayor

of Pittsburgh, four City Council seats,
seven County Council seats, three judge-
ships each on the Allegheny County Court
of Common Pleas, the Commonwealth
Court and Superior Court, a seat on the
state Supreme Court and retention of anoth-
er state Supreme Court justice.

. Although this election does not have
the gravity or drama of last year’s presiden-
tial race, voting is nonetheless important.
Sometimes local and state officials make
more of a difference in our lives than feder-
al officials. For example, the composition
of the state Supreme Court determines how
state laws — which set the rules on day-to-
day living more than many federal laws —

. _ are interpreted and implemented.

-In anticipation of last year’s presiden-

tial election, many students registered to
vote in Pittsburgh. All students have this
option. We pay Pittsburgh and
Pennsylvania income taxes, and for all
intents and purposes this is our home at the
present. Local officials here have more
impact on us than those wherever we live
during breaks and summers. As such, we
should vote here.

Although we can’t register for this
election since the deadline has already
passed, it’s easy to do. Before we vote, we
need to educate ourselves so that we can
make an informed decision.

In just a few minutes, you can ﬁnd vot-
ers guides on the Web sites of both major
city newspapers, the Pittsburgh Post-.
Gazette (www.postgazette.com) and the
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (www.pitts-

-burglilive.com). Other local news sources

offer comprehensive election coverage.
Both the Tribune-Review and Post-

Gazette endorsed candidates for this elec— 8

tion. Their endorsement editorials, which
provided the reasons each newspaper sup-
ports the candidates, may be good
resources as well. v ’
, As we saw last year, every vote makes
a difference.
It only takes a few minutes out of a
Tuesday —- a few minutes that can have a
great deal of importance. A

Tasting Pitt’s water fountains

And now for some useless trivia: Did
you know that Pitt’s campus houses 873
water fountains, which shoot out an aver-
age of 10,000 gallons a day —— tl1at’s the
weight of 900 Chinese pan-

fountains there are used as porcelain battle
hehnets and the nozzles are sharpened and
attached to broomsticks as makeshift
spears. I fought my way through there and
even captured a desk.

THE PITT NEWS

Newly foundpride inAmerica

I am so proud of America and its reaction to the
Sept. 11 attacks, but not for the same reasons most peo-
ple are.

This will come as a shock to anyone who knows
me and may consider me a cynic of public

progress. We did this after the attacks and have done this
throughout our history. .

We ended many tyrannical regimes. We resisted
intemal political comrption. We granted equal rights to
many disadvantaged groups. And along

opinion and, until recently, an unwavering
critic of President George W. Bush. But I
have to admit that the “America Unites”
campaign has come full circle, even in the
perception of this pessimist who idolizes
Noam Chomsky as political dissident

I am beyond giddy with the Bush
administration’s emphasis on nnnrnuzrn, ' ' ' ‘ g
civilian casualties, its ﬁrm but friendly rela-
tionship with the press, its emphasis on dis-
tinguishing foes and respecting allies and

the way, we even landed A men on the
moon. _

But naturally, making social progress
means we always have some things to
work on, and what I see as self-righteous
foreign policy is one of but many prob-
lerrrs we will face in the coming years.

Government spending on national
defense is a great deal more than on edu-
cation, yet our schools still sell candy to
cover expenses. Equal rights are still rou-

so forth. I’m almost ready to join the ﬂag-

toting ranks of mainstream America — at least until the
next time the media spotlights our most recent social
injustice.

I haven’t always felt ﬂiis way though.

Initially after the attacks, it seemed to me that the
media was programming public opinion and joumalists
did not fairly represent the events that led up to the cur-
rent political climate. Instead, they focused too much on
developments in the investigation.

This inadequate reporting led me to do my own
research on the U.S. governrnent’s extensive interven-
tion in the Middle East. I wanted to understand what
made Osarna bin Laden the prime suspect before any
evidence had surfaced and why Westem inﬂuence is
unwelcome in some Muslim countries.

But our nation’s movement from ignorance and
arrogance to curiosity and humanitarianism, manifested
in the Bush administration’s actions, is what makes me
proud. The willingness to improve rather than stagnate
— as we saw in our changing response to the attacks — is
what gives our nation its greatness.

So no, the reason I’m proud of America is not
because of our economic superiority, politicalpower or
because “in the name of God and American national-
ism, we just are.” I’m proud of America because we’ve
made — and will continue to make — incredible social

tinely denied to gays, even at institutions
such as Pitt. And there appears to be no ceiling to cor-
porate capitalism’s environmental destruction or to dis-
parities in the distribution of American wealth. .

But at least we’re working on these problems, the
same way we’ve worked on previous problems of abo-
lition, suﬂiage and integration. ,

I have faith that, a generation from now, we will
have achieved enough enlightenment to regard our irri-
tial “we’re a great nation just because we are” reaction
to the “Attack on America” as stubborn Orwellian resis-
tance to the needed realization of our international sen-
sitivity.

I’m glad that we are beginning to see the short-
sightedness of our amazingly stagnant foreign policy in
the same way we currently see our past resistance to

movements that eventually led to social progress. When

we stop focusing on protecting just America and start
protecting — or at least considering — our brothers
abroad, we can sincerely proclaim ourselves champions
of liberty and equality. ‘

And our changing response to the attacks gives me
all the more hope that we will see that day.

westward. ho!

Photographer shoots western sky

Seth Dickerman
Into the West

Through Dec. 2
Pittsburgh Filmmakers

(412) 681-5449

HEATHER BowLAN
Senior Staff Writer

When one thinks of the western landscape, what often
come to mind _are desolate scenes of craggy rock face, sand
dunes and cacti. But this setting is diverse enough to
deserve many different portrayals, and right now at
Pittsburgh Filmmakers there is one unlike anything you’d
expect. ‘

Seth Dickerrnan’s exhibit “Into the West” gives us his
take on what the West has to offer, in particular an endless
sky. Dickerman does not use his’ photographs to record still
images, but instead makes movies with each picture. He
exposes the ﬁlm for two to four minutes, moving the carn-
era slowly as the scenery moves and changes. All of these
photographs were taken just after the sun had set or in
moonlight, so this makes for gorgeous colors and patterns
on a large scale. « .

These photographs ‘are very dreamlike and expres-
sionistic in their style; the artist lists Romantic
Expressionist painters as one of his inﬂuences. At times his
photographs veer toward “the postcard picture” — over-
whelmed by their subject and trite in their conception.

For instance, “Coral Beach,” a series of ﬁve panels
showing the progression of a sunset, seems to say, “Wish
you were here!” But you can’t ignore the beauty in the col-
ors stretching across the panels, moving ﬂom light to dark
“Red Headlands” is similar in its almost overeager perfec-
tion, although the sweeping rainbow of the sky at sunset --
every color is present, particularly deep oranges and pinks

— redeems it.

- Other photographs are just as colorful, but completely
original in their forms. These pieces take the viewer com-
pletely by surprise. For instance, in “Pescadero,” birds ﬂy
at sunset, but the birds appear to be dark splashes on a can-
vas of red-blue streaks. “Winter Moon” shows the familiar
image of the desolate road at night, but encompassed by
blinding white light from the sky. “Fountain” is a column
of a cloud against the sky’s deep blue.

More solid forms appear in a few of Dickerrnan’s pho-
tographs. “Fiery Palms” is a blurred, surreal image of burn-
ing palm trees. The bright orange-red against the green
background is a contrast that will catch your eye and keep

expansion.

Owner Michael Bahalib has tried to
open the restaurant in Pittsburgh for the last
three years. After months of construction
and planning, the restaurant opened to a

« closed celebration Oct. 27.

The restaurant sells itself as a sports
bar. A
Red maple leaves share the walls with
framed Steelers jerseys and photographs of

from the ceiling armouncing the restau-
rant’s heritage while a mural of Jack

crowd of people watching a game of eight-

through the tiny gap, pauses to let three
women walk in front of her, spots _some
open ﬂoor space, shakes her hips to the
music and disappears into the kitchen.

Sturey came to work at Philthy
McNasty’s after massive layoffs cost her
her maintenance job with USAirways.

“I like to entertain people,” she says.
“This place ﬁts my style.” ~

Sturey emerges from the kitchen cany-
ing a tray of hors d’oeuvres. She stops in
front of two ﬁreﬁghters dressed in their blue
uniforms. They are at Philthy McNasty’s as

part of a fund-raiser for the Western _

Pennsylvania Fireﬁghter’s Memorial Fund.

“You guys hungry?” Sturey asks, hold-
ing outlher tray. ~ ’

New people stream through the front

the table and the other balls scatter. Chief

weasels the butt end of his cue into a small S

Hokie pokie

Pitt pulls off upset against
No- 12 Virginia Tech

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer_

Pitt beat No. 12 Virginia Tech 38-7 at
Heinz Field on Saturday.

No tricks here, Halloween is over.

But maybe Pittleft its costumes on,

’ because it looked like the same team that

beat a dismal Temple squad 33-7 a week
before. It looked like the team that every-
one thought it would be at the beginning
of the season.

According to head coach Walt Harris,
Pitt looked like the Virginia Tech team it
expected to face this weekend.

‘They play great defense,” said
Harris of the Hokies, a team a week
removed from a top ﬁve position in the
national rankings but who’ve now lost
consecutive games for the first time since
1997. “They play tremendous special
teams, and they run the ball on offense.
The only difference between them and us
is we’re probably going to always throw
the ball pretty well.”

' Except for a blocked ﬁeld goal, which
Hokies defensive back Ronyell Whitaker
returned 71 yards for Virginia Tech’s only
touchdown, Pitt was all those things
against a big-time opponent for one
Saturday‘ in what so far has been a disap-
pointing season.

The defense held the volatile Hokies
offense to 151 yards total and only 15
yards rushing. The Pitt offense had a pass-
ﬁrst mentality against the nation’s top
ranked defense and came away with 245
passing yards. But then the rushing
offense picked up in the second half, and
Pitt ﬁnished with 148 yards on the ground.

“We finally did more of the things
that we needed to do to be successful,”
Harris said.

After going three and out on the ﬁrst
set of downs, quarterback David Priestley
started connecting with his receivers the
next time Pitt got the ball. He threw long
and incomplete to Antonio Bryant, but
pass interference was called on the
defense.’ On the very next play, Priestley
threw 24 yards to Bryant over the middle
for a touchdown. '

Virginia Tech was called for 11 penal-
ties, and it cost them 120 yards.

“Antonio made a great catch
early. . .and that got -me going,” said
Priestley, whose play has been under con-
stant sciutiny this season. . '

Later in the ﬁrst quarter, Priestley
threw to Bryant, who was again interfered
with, and a few downs later, Nick Lotz set
up for a 34-yard ﬁeld goal. The kick was
blocked and returned for a touchdown,
seemingly shifting the momentum back to
Virginia Tech. Pitt hadn’t been able to
shift it back in any game so far this season.

“Our biggest thing was overcoming
the adversity, and today we took a step
forward in doing that,” said Bryant, who
ﬁnished with ﬁve catches for 93 yards and
two touchdowns.

About ﬁve minutes into the second
quarter, Pitt surged ahead again when
Priestley hit a backpedaling R.J. English
with .a 33-yard pass for a score, putting
Pitt up 14-7. ‘g _

The defense couldn’t contain English,
who mostly caught short passes and
turned them into long gains by lowering
his head and straightening his arm into the
smaller defensive backs. English ﬁnished

with eight catches for 134 yards plus the.

touchdown.

“They quit today. We made them
quit,” English said of the Hokies. “They
wanted to get the hell out of here.”

After a Lotz ﬁeld goal, the defense,
which harassed Hokies quarterback Grant
Noel throughout the game, sacked Noel
on the ensuing set of downs and he fum-
bled. Pitt recovered and capitalized when
Bryant caught a 36-yard pass from
Priestley for his second touchdown of the
game.

The score stood at 24-7 at halftime,
and it just got worse for the Hokies from
there.

Noel connected with Pitt defensive
back Shawntae Spencer, who ran 68 yards
in the opposite direction to give Pitt a 31-
7 advantage. Quarterback Rod Rutherford
padded the blowout by keeping the ball
and nmning into the end zone with about
four minutes left in the game.

Antonio Bryant darts into the end zone for one of his two touchdowns against
the Hokies Saturday afternoon as the Panthers upset Virginia Tech 38-7.

After the game, Harris praised

«Priestley, who completed 16 of 26 passes

for three touchdowns and no intercep-
tions. '

“I think it’s his best performance ever
as a player because he won against a
ranked team. He ﬁnally beat a team that
no one in here thought he could beat,”
Harris said.

Priestley thanked the guys blocking
for him.

“The biggest thing that has to be rec-
ognized today is our offensive line. I don’t
think I got sacked once, and if I did, it was

my fault. I can only remember getting hit

one time,” Priestley said.

Harris also wasn’t afraid to comment
on the simpliﬁed offense Pitt has run in
the last two games, perhaps reason Pitt is
still in bowl contention with three games
to play.

“I think changing [the offense] _»
rnight’ve helped us, obviously, and I’m

not too proud to say that it has helped us,”
Harris said. “It gives our players a little
more time to know the play, and it gives
our quarterback a little bit more time to
know the coverage.”

Defense shuts down Hokie offense

KEVIN ‘NASH
Staff Writer

For the ﬁrst time this season, the
offense and the defense choked, but the
big story of the day was the defense led
by linebacker Gerald Hayes and defen-
sive end Brian Guzek.

The defense has struggled this season
against top ranked offenses, but on
Saturday, it - was a different story. Pitt
made big plays and gave its offense a
chance to win the ballgame. The out-
standing play of the defense helped set up
good ﬁeld position for most of the after-
noon. '

In one of the biggest plays of the
game, Guzek caused Virginia Tech quar-
terback Grant Noel to fumble with 2 min-
utes, 30 seconds left in the first half. This
set up a quick 36-yard strike from David
Priestley to Antonio Bryant, which put the

Panthers up by 17.

The-key to the defense’s success was
its ability to stop Virginia Tech’s run. This
is something the defense has not done this
season.

During Pitt’s first six games, its oppo-
nents averaged 183 rushing yards per
game. The Panthers got back on track
against Temple, who rushed for minus-36

yards last weekend, and it appears that it

carried over to the next week.

Key" plays included Hayes stuffing
Hokies rimning back Kevin Jones on a
third and 2 situation. This was the closest
Virginia Tech got to a ﬁrst down in the
ﬁrst quarter. ‘

“We knew if we could come out and
stop the run, we could set the tone for the
whole game,” ﬂee safety Ramon Walker
said.

Pitt’s defense held Noel to 4 yards
passing in the ﬁrst quarter and did not
allow a ﬁrst down for the entire quarter.

The Hokies’ offense had 1 rushing
yard on 11 attempts for the entire ﬁrst
half. They also passed for 66 yards, but
that number is deceiving because they got
48 of those yards in the drive the Hokies
put together before halftime. The Hokies
made it to Pitt’s 31-yard line before Torrie
Cox intercepted Noel.

This was Virginia Tech’s best drive of
the day. The defense blanked the Hokies
offense, with the only scoring coming
when defensive end Lamar Cobb blocked
Nick 'Lotz’s 34-yard ﬁeld goal attempt,
which was returned 71 yards by comer
back Ronyell Whitaker for a touchdown.

At this point the game was tied 7-7 in
the first quarter, and ﬂashbacks to the
Panthers taking an early lead against
Miami then giving it back began to
appear. But the defense did not falter as it
rose to the occasion and continued to

The Panther defense emerged strong
again in the second half.

Noel ran nine plays, successfully
picking up two first downs. The latter of
the two first downs was executed on a
crucial fourth and 1 situation. But the
Hokies couldn’t gain any momentum
from the situation and continued to be sti-
ﬂed by the Pitt defense.

On third and 410, comerback
Shawntae Spencer stepped in front of a
Noel pass and picked it oif. Spencer pro-
ceeded to beat Noel up the sideline for a
68-yard touchdown run.

“It felt good to make a big play in a '

big game. Recently I’ve felt like I’ve been
letting my team down,” Spencer said. “I
saw the receiver break the route, and I had
a good break.” «

The defense fniished its day holding
Virginia Tech, who has averaged 145
yards rushing per game, to 15 yards on
the ground. The Hokies had only 136
yards passing and eight first downs. V

“Our comers played extremely well
and made Grant have to hit some tough
throws,” head coach Walt Harris said
about the play of his secondary.

This was a vast improvement for the
Panthers defense, who had given up an
average of 207’yards passing in their last
three games. * —

Baseball needs
to keep Twins

     

Spars View 3

Joe Marchilena.

Last week, Major League Baseball
announced that it would have enough
votes from the owners to make the
Minnesota Twins one of the two teams
that could be contracted this off—season.

Imagine this for a second: You are
the owner of a baseball team.

Today you have to decide which
teams you think should be discontinued.

Your choices: two expansion teams
that have been synonymous with losing
since their inception or two teams that
have won a World Series in the last 10
years.

Old offense key in Pitt wins

got a‘shot at being a contender and they
attract fans to the game? _

None of the other teams that could be
contracted have good attendance num-
bers. And of those teams, only the Florida
Marlins have a legitimate shot at being a
contender in the near future. V

0 Who would have thought that, after
a big loss to Syracuse, Virginia -Tech
would lose to Pitt the next week?

Other than a few people on this cam-
pus, not too many would have guessed it.
How could they, given the circum-
stances?

The Panthers had only beaten the
Hokies once in eight tries and had not
won a game they weren’t supposed to win
in quite some time.

Maybe having Tony Dorsett on the
sideline gave Pitt a little extra determina-
tion.

Or maybe it was that the Panthers

‘threw the ball successfully, something

they hadn’t done against a good defense

0 all year.

It helped that Antonio Bryant and
R.J. English turned in two of the best per-
formances Pitt has had all year.

Bryant caught ﬁve passes for 92

«yards and two touchdowns, while English

had eight catches totaling 132 yards and a
touchdown.

The Panthers have won two in a row
since returning to last year’s offensive
game plan.

How much different would the sea-

son beif Pitt could’ve done this all year? ‘

0 Unfortunately, ‘ the Steelers were
unable to make it a sweepat Heinz Field
this weekend, losing to the Ravens 13-10.

Despite the loss, the Steelers have to.

feel good about what they accomplished
against Ba1timore’s defense.

Two weeks ago, all this offense could‘

do was give the ball to Jerome Bettis and
watch him 1'l1I’l over defenders. , _
Now the Steelers’ - offense has

— become, dare I say it, two-dimensional.

For the second week in a row,
Kordell Stewart has passed for more than
200 yards, and the Steelers almost got

100-yard games from their receivers in

back-to-back weeks.

Let’s not forget about Bettis either.
For a guy who was supposed to be on the
downside of his career, Bettis has come
through when called upon. On Sunday, he
ﬁnished just 9 yards short of being the
first player to run for 100 yards against
the Ravens’ defense in 45 games.

While the loss does bring the Steelers
a little closer to the rest of their division,
the way the offense performed against the
Ravens gives reason to believe that this
team has as good a chance as anyone at
winning a Super Bowl. _ '
