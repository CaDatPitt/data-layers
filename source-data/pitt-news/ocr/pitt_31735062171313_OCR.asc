University Denies
Request For Names

by MARY ANN MARKO

The University has decided to ignore a request by the House Com-
mittee on Internal Security for the names of all guest speakers who ap-
pear on campus. except in connection with courses of instruction. ac-
cording to Jack Freeman. executive assistant to the chancellor.

Besides the names of speakers. the committee all asked for the
group identification or sponsorship of the speakers. the amount paid
and to whom the money was paid and the source of the funds.

. Mr.’ Freeman said. "The University did not respond because that
‘kind of information is not kept and would have to be obtained. It would

be quite an involved process to obtain it."

He added that there is also a question of academicwfreedom

involved.

In consulting with attorneys. the University found that it did not
have to provide the information. unless forced to do so by subpoena.

it had no intent to use a subpoena
to obtain it.

According to a letter from Con-
gressman Richard H. Ichord,
chairman of the House Commit-
tee on Internal Security, received
by Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
on Julyl, the committee was di-
rected by the House to make in-
quiry into “those organizations,
who by their activities, would ef-
fect changes in our government
or the administration of our gov-
ernment by force, violence or
other unlawful means.”

The letter went on to say: "Pre-
liminary data available indi-
cates that guest speakers repre-
senting such organizations have
made numerous appearances on
many college and university cam-
puses. and have received honor-
ariums which could be of signifi-
cance in funding their activities."

The deadline for submission of

such information to the commit-
tee was Sept. 15.

Treasurer Reports

Seek Innovation $80 Million Fund

by LORETTA HORRELL

The College of Arts and Sciences Cabinet is try-
ing to make the the Pitt studentfs college life more
relevant. according to recent proposals.

Having felt a lack of quality and variability in
the undergraduate courses. the CAS Cabinet would
like to develop organizations of undergraduate stu-
dents within each department.

The organized student could work with the fac-
ulty to improve the present courses and quality of
education within the major.

Last year the English Department, undergrad-
uate students and concerned professor combined
their efforts to review the undergraduate program
of courses for English majors.

The Cabinet is also researching the quality of
teaching and the use of upperclass students as
teaching assistants.

"Quality of teaching. a major interest of stu-
dents." says Ellen Wartella. chairman of the CAS
Cabinet. "should be handled by students working
jointly with the administration."

She said a consensus of student opinions should
be an important input in the consideration of renew-
al or discontinuation of a faculty contract.

ﬁg‘ This term several upperclass undergraduate

students are teaching assistants within the college.
The CAS Cabinet wants to insure these students
from possible exploitation.

University expansion, an issue Wartella is con-
cerned with, creates problems for the student body

and Oakland community. Miss Wartella and col-
leagues feel that “the students need space to com-
municate with others” and the University should

According to David Smith. treasurer of the
University. the latest financial report indicates that
the University has $80 million in its Endowment
Fund.

When certain individuals. foundations and other
sources give the University money to be used for
endowment. it is placed into this found.

The initial amount has to be retained and invest-
ed and only the interest can be spent for operating
purposes. The donor usually specifies what the in-
come is to be used for. but if he doesn‘t. the money
is placed into the endowment budget for support of
the overall operation.

Uses of the donor's income vary from support
of a particular school or a particular department of
a school to a special function within a department
such as scholarships, research or a professorship.

Investments for the $80 million fall under the fol-
lowing categories: commercial paper and certifi-
cates of deposit. bonds (railroad. industrial. etc.>.
common stock. real estate. mortgages and miscel-
laneous short term investments. ‘

The University owns $700.000 in mortgages.
Smith said. Mortgages have always been consi-
dered good investments. however. the University is
trying to own more property instead of just mort-
gaging. More money can be made if the property is
owned.

The University has three direct investments:
the Eureka Building, College Garden Apartments
and Penn Plaza.

dowment Fund Trustee Committee. He establishes

become a “soldier for a move-
ment seeking to scrape tradition-
al education for politics.“

Joy initially attributed campus
unrest to student concern over
university reform. social prob-
blems and the Vietnamese War.
The war. however. he later as-
serted. is only the "rallying point
for those seeking societal destruc-
tion."

Placing student radicals in one
of four categories—"tag-alongs,”
“interested students,” “politiciz-
ed radicals,” and “crazies,” Joy
concluded that campuses are ex-
periencing a moral “sickness par-
allel to that of Nazi Germany.”
Going further, he referred to mod-

ern social philosopher Ernest Van.
Den Hogg who suggests that “the

university is progressively be-
coming a progressive kindergar-
ten.”

For years. Joy claimedf uni-
versity professors have attempt-
ed to forge “the university into a
staging ground for revolution."
Failing in the functioning Ameri-
can political system in which they
will remain a minority. students
and professors turn to violence,
which. Joy notes. is constantly ac-
celerating on the campus.

His solution is to reemphasize
“traditional educational values"
on the campus by reaffirming se-
lective admissions standards.
which. he suggested, will shape
education only for those who want
it. He concluded. “To suggest edu-

gest it is for nobody."

Leonard Weinglass, co-counsel
in the Chicago Conspiracy trials,
dismissed Joy's remarks by be-
ginning, “Today we have campus
unrest and why isn’t there more
of it?” Rather than considering

only the general question of calm’

pus unrest, Weinglass, throughout
his presentation, cited numerous
specific examples of “society’s
repressive acts” beyond the uni-
versity sphere, which he noted,
have produced the new “move-
ment among all humane people.”

Describing the educational sys-
tem as “grim, joyless, and totally
in a state of crisis,” Weinglass
then indicated that universities
are unresponsive to vital student
demands. For example, students
cannot. he continued, dissolve the
“combination of government and
university for militaristic ends.”
That concerned people, striving
within the traditional system,
have so far effected on changes,
means that “they must now seek
other forms of action.

However, Weinglass explained,
campus violence is not the real
danger. Rather he asserted “the
problem is how passive we have
become in the face of an over-
whelming violent government.”
This government, he maintained,
having destroyed physical life
both nationally and international-
ly, also tolerates.massive social
problems and an inequitable legal
system.

“We are morally wrong,” he
suggested, “if we—like Mr. Joy-
permit governmental horrors to
multiply.” Citing a Latin Ameri-
can priest, Weinglass concluded,
“For a Christian not to be a revol-
utionary might be a mortal sin.”

The debate was moderated by
Dr. Thomas Kane, director of the
William Pitt Debate Union, who
managed to preserveorder
throughout constant cries of
“RightOn!”

\ -_ tional dormitory project.

McCormick Hall, formerly an
 all-girls dormitory, presently

 7 dents. The project was conceived

_ Will Miller, assistant director
or housing, said that “thus far
 ‘ there have been no major prob-
 ,', ::f_l¢ltlS, and we are greatly pleased
,1. jjgiwith McCormick.” When asked if
  _Mc’Cormick was an experimental
«gpgoject for the proposed Hillside

‘V success of McCormick Hall would

 , ed new complex.

 ' cy in the larger suites, need to be
  resolved’ by the residents. Unlike
,, the-“present arrangement in Mc-

9 many as ten persons in a suite, the
ff proposed dormitories will have

cy problem.

 Miller also noted that while
" "some classes are being held in the
ylounges of McCormick Hall, he
:‘  ‘hopes that more will meet there,

'~‘J_‘integ.ral part of University life

The Housing Office has receiv-
 edmany inquiries from other col-
leges pertaining to the planning
_an,d’fprogress of McCormick Hall.
.. While many colleges have “co-ed”
_ ‘_ ‘dormitories, the majority have
’ _’men on one floor and women on

When asked about dating, one
resident said, “It seems that most
dating occurs inter-dormitory
rather than intra-dormitory, with
this type of setting breeding more
non-romantic friendships than ro-
mantic relationships.”

Some students believe that in
the co-ed situation, the girl he-
comes less the sex object and
more a friend.

McCormick Hall provides an in-
dependent environment with less
rules and formalities. There is
freedom to petition or call a meet-
ing if any problem or need war-
rants it.

It seems too early to label co-ed
living at the University a com-
plete success and only those stu-
dents living in McCormick Hall
can be the valid judges. But if the
first three weeks of co-ed life in
McCormick Hall are an indica-
tion of its desirability, there is lit-
tle doubt that co-educational hous-
ing will be offered as an option to
students in the future.

Weinglass Predicts Revolution

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

Leonard Weinglass is not sure
where the revolution is taking us.
He is certain, though. that the
time for it is at hand.

"The struggle," maintains the
young lawyer, “is taking on seri-
ous proportions. Many people are
devoting their lives to it. We‘ve
time . . . and the numbers are on
our side. It-will happen."

What “it” will be is the com-
plete restructuring of American
society as we now know it. “The
change will be a total change in
the way people. regard them-
selves,” Weinglass explained.

As convinced as he is about the
inevitability of change, Weinglass,
who shared» the national spotlight
as co-counsel with William Koust-
ler as defenders of the “Chicago
Seven." cannot predict what type
of society will fill the vacuum.

"Literally no one can define it.

There are hundreds of experi- I

ments going on around the coun-
try, and most of those are failing.

In the course of the struggle.

though, people will be changed.“

His travels have enabled Wein-
glass to examine some of those
experiments personally. He has
observed several communes and,
when in Pittsburgh, Weinglass ac-
cepted an invitation to spend a
night at the University’s Inter
Cultural House.

Since the trial at Chicago, Wein-
glass has defended many mem-
bers of the so-called “New Left."
Teaming with William Kunstler
as he did in Chicago, Weinglass
is currently seeking the acquittal
in Detroit of two members of the
White Panthers (an outgrowth of
Yippies) charged with conspiracy.

HAPPY COINCIDENCE
Weinglass‘ association with the
"New Left" began almost by ac-
cident. "I was in Newark where I
have my law practice," he recall-
ed. “and Tom Hayden was also

there. I went to Chicago with him _

and ended up as a co-counselor.

Since that happy coincidence.
Weinglass has gained ‘national ac-
claim. an imp'rfess‘ivé" ;list of
clients. a shaggier head of hair.
and a belief that the movement
can and must succeed".

“ld’d like ‘thé‘.i¢§zoiution to be .

bloodless,” he said, “but the other
side won’t allow it to be. People

like President -Nixon and John
Mitchell understand; their ana-
lysis of the threat to them is cor-
rect.”

Anticipating violence. Wein-
glass hopes that the revolution-
aries will not offer too many
cheeks for martyrdom. “If the
movement becomes powerless,“
he fears, “it will be wiped out. "

Convinced of the institutional
stagnation in contemporary
America, Weinglass bears no ani-
mosity towards the nation’s ju-
dicial system. He thinks that “our
court system is a good system and
it should stay the same."

Though the system lacks inher-

ent bias, the prevalent moods of
society, feel Weinglass. must ne-
cessarily poisonyany jury’s impar-
tiality. ‘

“When 84 per cent of the people
think Black Panthers are danger-
ous, as one recent poll showed,
the mood is bound to be translated
into the courts. Our judicial sys-
tem will always work against
those moving for change.”

One remedy for this to make

jurors understand their own prej-
udices. Weinglass noted that At-

torney Charles Gary employed (.

this type of sensitivity program
successfully while choosing jurors
for the trial of Huey Newton.

Joy Admits Optimism

by POHLA SMITH

Daniel Joy is the epitome o-f to-
days young conservative. The 27
year old editor of the New Guard

magazine. official organ of the’

Young Americans for Freedom
(YAF). defended the conservative
position against Leonard Wein-
glass of the New Left in a debate
entitled “Campus Unrest and Its
Causes" Monday evening.

The young lawyer, dressed in a
black, pin-striped, vested suit, de-
finedconservatism as a belief in
the American political tradition.
free and private economic enter-
prise, the freedom of man (though
not a do-your-own-thing ideology).
and firm anti-communism.

Joy stressed that conservatives

believe “Marxism-Leninism-Mad ‘

ism ideology is the only philoso-
phy that possesses the potential
by which the United States could
be politically defeated."

Though Joy admitted he dis-
agrees with Nixon’s attitudes on
secondary issues, the conserva-
tive declared himself a firm be-
liever in Nixon’s attitude toward
what Joy considers the primary

problem in America. “Nixon and. ‘

Agnew are in a good position to
handle the disintegration within
America. They are prudently mov-
ing towards excluding violence-
prone groups.” He argued that
New Left groups such as the
Black Panthers “must be render-
ed‘v?iiieffective.”

‘Quoting an unnamed United
States Senator, Joy branded Spiro
Agnew “the greatest vice-presi-
dent since John C. Calhoun.” He
went on to say, “His (Agnew‘s)
success as a vice-president is in-
estimable. Agnew is becoming a
spokesman of political attitudes."

Joy avowed‘ that “it is a fore-
gone conclusion who is going to

win the war between conserva-
tives and the New Left. The New ‘

Left has lost all pertinency.” He

declared the liberal movement to

be dead. Though he does not be-

lieve Republicans will win this

fall, he believes Nixon can achieve

“a smashing victory in 1972,”

unless something drastic occurs"
during the next two years.

Speaking of campus unrest,..Joy
asserted, “There are no cut and
dry causes.” He feels that the lib-
eral educators who have domin-
ated the college scene for the last
50 to 60 years “have a direct re-
lationship to the minds which have
motivated the New Left to politi-
cal action.” A

‘Asked if he believes the major-
ity of American students adhere
to the principles outlined in Presi-
dent Nixon’s recent speech at
Kansas State University, he con-
tended that the “overwhelming

number of students would sub—»’:}

scribe to the substance of his
speech,‘ if it had been uttered by
their particular political hero.

Ii1tc1°r1ational Conflict

by JOYCE SMITH

Dr. Jerome Laulicht. from So-
ciology Research Department.
and Dr. Steve Rosen. a Political-
Science professor. have initiated
two new courses this fall in the
area of international conflict. The
courses are designed to give stu-
dents a chance to study the issue
of conflict and waystoward pos-
sible solutions.

Dr. Laulicht defines interna-
tional conflict as "not only being
restricted to war; rather, war
results from conflict. The United
States and Russia are engaged in
conflict but not in war.” He
breaks conflict down into three
types: urban, international and
civil war. The international level,
in his opinion, is the main focus at
this time.

Dr. Laulicht strongly believes
that “it is one of the obligations
of the University" to give stu-
dents the opportunity to be train-
ed and specialize in doing some-
thing about conflict.

At present, two courses are be-
ing offered with hopes of expand-
ing this field into a possible ma-
jor. Dr. Laulicht’s course in Arms
Control and Disarmament and Dr.
Rosen’s course in War and Revol-
ution. Dr. Laulicht is very opti-
mistic about having more courses
offered soon, for he has received
support from many of the faculty

members, including those outside
of the Sociology and Political Sci-
ence Departments. However,
there has been a lack of student
interest and participation, which
he attributes mainly to insuffi-
cient publicity.

To those students interested in
solving or putting an end to con-
flict and not doing anything about
it, Dr. Laulicht says. ‘‘I‘m getting
tired of people saying that we‘ve
got to do something about the
wars and not using part of their
time in college doing something
relevant about them. Where are
all those people who scream about
war? Why aren’t they doing any
research on solving it?“

GRE is Oct. 24. Scores from
this administration will be report-
ed to the graduate schools about
Dec. 1. Students planning to regis-
ter for the October test date are
advised that applications receiv-
ed by ETS after Oct. 6 will incur
a $3 late registration fee. After
Oct. 9. there is no guarantee that
applications for the October test
date can be processed.

Dec. 12. Jan. 16. Feb. 27. April
24 and June 19. 1971. Equiva-
lent late fee and registration dead-
lines apply to these dates. Choice
of test dates should be deter-
mined by the requirements of
graduate schools or fellowships to
which one is applying. Scores are
usually reported to graduate
schools five weeks after a test
date.

The Graduate Record Examin-
ations include an Aptitude Test of
general scholastic ability and Ad-
vanced Tests measuring achieve-
ment in 20 major fields of study.
Full details and registration
forms for the GRE are contained

   Editorial

The most basic social revolutionin history is now in the off-
ing. It goes beyond racial lines, ethnic lines and if some of the
most thoughtful proponents of this revolution are successful, it
would alter the traditional economic and political structures of
this nation and conceivably others.

It is the revolution in thought patterns and “social customs”
that the women’s liberation movement is promulgating. The strug-

glers are fighting their traditional societal definitions: they are,

trying to break the cellophane on the factory-made packages to
which women have been assigned; and more, they are striving to
define the colorations, shapes and sizes of these packages.

On one level, it is a semantic battle, a battle which involves
values judgments. The terms under which women have labored-
the World War II “broad the contemporary “chick” and the pron-
ographic “piece”, “stuff”, “hole” — have been labels used by
men to refer to the “package women” that they have always
dominated.

The type of value judgment involved is the same that was
faced by sympathetic white liberals at the advent of the black
liberation struggle when they were required to choose between
the words “Black” and “Negro”. That conscious decision
was a statement of support.

This semantic evaluation, however, is merely one small in-
dication of the dedication of the movement women to decide for
themselves what they are as persons in a sexist culture.

 “objective” discriminations against women are now
acknowledged by nearly everyone; women characteristically re-
ceive lower wages for the same amount of work; they are ex-
cluded from jobs and ‘professions that are deemed “unsafe” for
theigentler sex. A femalestaff writer for ‘The Pitt News, a rather

- good one it might be added, was informed by a spokesman at

the Pittsburgh Post Gazette that that newspaper does not hire
women reporters “because they can’t battle the streets at night.”

Guidance counsellors steer women students away from “mas-
culine” fields, such as law, medicine and steer them into “fem-
inine professions, such as teaching and nursing.

But the major battle for the women to wage is a mental one.

by MARK COHEN
Staff Columnist

The past week has provided the news media

with some fine entertainment. Domestic repres-

sion and foreign intervention are reaching new

highs. So is the rhetoric emanating from the

Executive branch of government. Let’s take a
look at what is coming down.

A white police officer was shot in a black
section of New Orleans. As was the case just re-
cently, in Philadelphia, the Police used this. ac-
tion as an excuse to raid the local headquarters
of the Black Panther Party. C.B.S. brought the
Gestapo type raid into our living rooms in full
color. ' ‘

It looked like the entire New Orleans Police
force was there in riot gear to take their shot at-
the “uppity niggers.” A number of Panthers
were arrested in the raid for possession of fire-
arms which is a Constitutional right unless you
have political differences with the government.
The result of the Police attack has been an out-
break of firebombings in New Orleans.

Mid-East

The Middle-East is boiling over again. The
conflict is not simply Arab-Zionist but also guer-
illa movements within Arab countries. King Hus-
sein of Jordan, a bulwark of reaction in the Arab
world, is being threatened by an internal revolu-
tionary movement. '

Hussein’s army is attempting to liquidate the
guerilla movement which the King has admitted
commands wide support among the masses of
people in Jordan. Nixon unilaterally dispatched

1,500 Marines to‘Jordan plus mobilizing the Med-
iterranean fleet to protect the 400 U.S. civilians.

The materialization of U.S. military aid plus
the threat by Israel to intervene in the Jordanian
civil war on the side of Hussein has necessitated
Syrian aid to their Arab comrades. ,

Supportive Measiuliriii’ if ”‘ _

Actually, the U.S. troops are Being deployed
to maintain the Hussein regime which has fav-
ored U.S. corporate investments. The guerillas,
if successful, would nationalize U.S. business
investments.

Nixon, acting as a puppet for U.S. oil inter-
ests, deems it necessary to ensure Hussein’s
survival. Protecting U.S. civilians is essentially
the same rationale L.B.J. used in sending 22,000
Marines into the Dominican Republic in 1965 to
block the revolutionary movement there.

But that’s not all folks. Toledo, Ohio, was the
scene of a repeat of the New Orleans raid. Even
The Pittsburgh Press article on the Toledo raid
stated there seemingly was no connection between

the Policeman who was shot and the Black Pan-

ther Party.

A few days later, though, a Panther was
charged in the shooting. It just must be left-wing
propaganda that there is a nationwide conspiracy
by government officials to destroy the Black
Panther Party.

Attorney GENERALISIMO John Mitchell
summed it up on Friday, Sept. 18. Speaking to
a womens’ group Mitchell stated, “This country
is moving so far to the right you won’t even be
able to recognize it.”

Regardless of a women’s “success”, it is “success” in a world
of men who constantly work on her guilt. A woman is program-

med to see her life as a series of short steppingstones leading to
her ultimate fulfillment as wife and mother.

 The movement is beginning to question these basic assump-

”tions concerning the women’s “palace”. The push for day care

centers is one outgrowth of a changing philosophy. It has been

3' discovered that children do not experience a stunted development
if partially raised by qualified “outsiders.” One portion of the
movement is challenging the structure of the nuclear family,
considering the institution of marriage a man-made oppression of
women.

At the University, the impetus has been curtailed, partially
by co-option from the administration. Hamstrung by a powerless
Advisory Committee the establishment of a women’s studies pro-
gram has been put off for several months pending the findings
of the hand-picked group.

An indication of the ignorance surrounding the issue was
voiced by Chancellor Posvar, who questioned the academic place
of a feminist studies department (What would you learn?). A
response to him involves a multi-leveled explanation of the omis-
sion of women from History. Who has heard of Margaret Swan-
ger, Maud Gonne, Emma Goldman? What’ about the marriage.
divorce and support laws? We have a lot of catching up to do.

The Editor and Associate Editor of The Pitt News endorses
the Symposium on Feminism scheduled to begin to day at the
University. The women’s liberation movement is _a force that
must be reckoned with: it may be the vanguard of new cultural

. definitions and perhaps even the dissolution of our traditional
A structures. »

In any event, it is bound to shake up our heads.

Projects: Black ,/frsrrwz firms

by RICHARD J. PALAZZI

(Editor's Note: The follow-

‘ing is the final installment in

the reflections of a former VIS-
TA worker in the ghettoes of
Chicago. The author is now en-
rolled in the University and
works extensively for the cam-
pus radio station WPGH.)

In a way, the cities’ approach
to poor people is not unlike
that of the federal government
toward American Indians. There
is no regard for their land or
their neighborhood, there is
certainly no program to help
them keep and improve it, and
all our good intentions seem
to only make them less happy.
Why, we even put poor people
on reservations now. Yes, reser-
vations —— that’s what people are
coming to call the huge public
housing developments that are
springing up in our cities.

In theory, the public housing
program is good. It provides
thousands and thousands of
dwelling units to replace some
of those torn down by urban re-
newal. The rent on these units
varies according to a family’s
income. And the units them-
selves are probably better than
anything a poor family has
ever lived in.

While they are not deluxe.

(frequently with painted ce-
ment block walls and drywell

. housing’s

partitions), they have attribu-
tes such as a fully-equipped
kitchen, individual furnace, and
a nice new bathroom. But in
actuality, the “projects” are
a most undesirable place to
live. They pose problems that
the planners never even
thought of — or did they?
Separatism

The first and most obvious
shortcoming is the seperatism
involved. Just like the reserva-
tions keep the Indians to them-
selves, the project housing
keeps Blacks and poor people
all stacked up together, out of

our hair. It is, in a word, rac-

ist, even within itself.

For example, the Chicago
Housing Authority operates
fifty-four buildings, all but
four of which are _ in Black
neighborhoods. The fifty build-
ings have a 99% Black popula-
tion, while the buildings locat-
ed in white neighborhoods have
a Black occupancy rate of 1%
to 7%. The CHA was recently
found guilty of racial descri-
mination for just this reason,
but how long has this “keep-
ing the Black people in their
places” been going on — and
how long and how often will
it continue in our cities?

Another problem of public
towering buildings,
some holding perhaps a thou-

sand families, is lack of recre-
ational area. You see, those of
us who live in high-rise apart-
ment buildings‘ seldom have
more than two children. In-
deed, most such apartment
buildings forbid children alto-
gether.

But poor families living in
the projects have quite a few
children. The units are small,
so there is not much indoor

-play space. And the outdoor

play space is not as large, per-
haps, as four or five backyards
in your neighborhood. So this
leaves as many as several thou-
sand children playing on streets,
in what minimal yard there is,
in halls, and on balconies. This
creates two other problems -
noisy halls, and deadly bal-
conies.

There is always the scream-
ing and running of children out-
side your door when you live in
public housing. Sometimes‘ you
wish the kids would fall over
the twenty-fifth floor balcony,
which they sometimes do. You
see, the gaps in the balcony
fencing are often big ‘enough
for a small child to squeeze
through. And the fences are low
enough for a large child to
climb over. _ *

Hell. I’d better stop here, or
you'll think I'm hinting at gen-
ocide.

Beginnings I
Tuesday evening, a small number of persons
met at CMU to coordinate Wednesday’s activities
after a rather large and idea-filled rally. The

group numbered less than ten and was chaired
by Robin Grossman, a CMU student. '

Wednesday’s activities were discussed; legal
counsel was sought from Tom Kerr of the ACLU;
our dedication to non-violence was repeatedly af-
firmed: it was decided to take a new approach
and pursue ongoing communication with the pol-

ice department via. the new Director, Mr. Bing- tun

ler. The group worked all evening refining their
goals and drawing up and printing specific goals
for the participants of the march.

Organization: The Doom of Revolution

by ALLEN DARLING
Staff Columnist

“That - which includes all
change never changes; without
change time is meaningless;

without time, space is destroyed;
thus we arrive at the void.”

The absurdity of revolution is
gratefully becoming more abun-
dantly clear to many people, and
the first time is giving it even
the faintest hope of being suc-
cessful. And that's no contradic-
tion.

In our efforts to bring about
what is unquestionably necessary
social reform, we’ve grown sus-
ceptible to the same congenital
defect that killed the ideal of
America in childbirth, and has
doomed the “movement” or the
“revolution” to failure from its
inception. ‘

Organizational man, by virtue
of the concept of the organiza-
tion «itself, is incapable of ac-
complishing any ideal reform.
Rather it tends to replace in-
justice with intolerance, ideals
with synthetic realities. And one
corruption with another.

Unfortunately any revolution-
ary movement acquires leaders,

caught up in reendorsing its own
rhetoric that its initial perspec-
tives are clouded rapidly in a
miasma of anger, frustration
and personal motivation.

Sadly, even within the “move-
ment,” the acid-tripper becomes
the ego tripper, a metamorpho-
sis that occurs to individual and
institution alike. The transfor-
mation is from a vital social
force to another interest group,
to a power-oriented establish-
ment, or to non representative
self-proclaimed representatives.

system but strengthening it.

This emanates from our al-
most instinctive use of organi-
zational hierarchy even in our
attempts to reform the organiza-
tional hierarchy. We replace.
We do not change.

The anti-establishment is the
new establishment. Thus the
“movement” is hypocrisy and
the “revolution” perverse.

The hope of the cultural re-
volution comes out of the disil-
lusionment of more and more
people. Dissatisfaction with so-
ciety bore a movement; dissatis-
faction with that movement is
bearing vital and wide spread
personal reevaluation.

For many, “do your own thing”
no longer means do “our thing
with us.” More and more people
are making decisions as indepen-
dent entities to “drop-out” and
live, as much as possible, with-
out infringement from any group
or system that pre-emptively de-
termines our social and political
values.

 Response is welcomed by the
 editors of the Pitt News.
 Anyone wishing to make his
3 views known may do so by
contacting Virginia Joyce or
Don Marbury at the office,
417 Schenley Hall, or by ex-
tensions 318 or 319. Columns
fall under the same provi-
sions as letters, that is they
are subject to editing due to
space limitations.

 

New Mobe last year by its lead-
er Stu Brown, because, in his
estimation, the organization had
lost its impetus and perspective,
and no longer served the ideal
that it was formed to serve, is
indicative of the growing realiz-
ation that successful reform will
be reached through individual
embodiment of ideals and not
through hierarchal and historical
group didacticism.

The frequency with which
people are denying groups the
right to use their bodies without
their minds, and the energy with
which they are sitting down to
be‘ counted as one instead of

one among many, provides the

hope that on the corpse of the
“movement” we can attain true
change.

Perhaps from a co-opted “re-
volution” we can move to the es-
tablishment of true reform and
real unity in our individual ef-
forts to attain a self-disciplined
freedom and a mutual coopera-
tion and understanding.

Whether enough people do or
don't do enough and soon enough
is what we must wait to see.

Letters Come
  From Upset
 Panther Fans

   

:3‘.-

  ;  ..Three letters were dropped of at the Pitt News sports desk
f ‘ in one day, something that’s hard to believe. They really were,
 though. »

-‘ 7 All of them are related to last Saturday’s Panther-UCLA

game, with the crowd being the focal point.
First, Jeff Paull, a student, writes:

. “Last Saturday, the Panthers came very close to a victory

‘over the UCLA Bruins. In the midst of all the dissappointment,

‘however, can the Pitt fans really see that? It's unfortunate that

  ,_  .’ by the fourth minute into the second half most of the spectators

had given up. The fact that UCLA could score twice in rapid suc-
’ cession seemed to drain all hope for a win. It should not have
‘ been that way. Twice in the second half Pitt was in scoring posi-

 ‘ _ tion and could have regained the lead, but the people in the stu-
 _ ' dent section didn’t really seem to care.

“What most of the student fans don’t seem to realize is that

I ]’ ‘when we fall behind the team needs encouragement from the

.5 -stands more than when they have the lead. Those who think that
cheering for every play, standing for kickoffs, applauding the

  ‘team at half time, and showing enthusiasm does little to inspire

the team, should stay at home and watch——or else read the final

_ ._- I -score in the paper.

:“It’s too bad, also, that some people don’t have the consi-

  ,.derat_ion to let others watch the game since they have no desire
 1 ~17 -« to watch it themselves. I missed the final three minutes of the
-  game because I was involved in trying to break up a fight that

“It’s a shame also that Denny Ferris might have scored in

I “The Panthers did better than had been expected of them

 7. . with the loss of Ralph Cindrich. When will the Pitt students do
_  ‘what is expected of them as loyal supporters of the team?”

The second letter comes from a law student, Bruce E. Win-

 - ter. He says:

,“To the security guards at the Pitt Stadium,
“During the football game against UCLA, a fight broke out

Eyes T.V. Cameras

by BILL N AAB
Associate Sports Editor

Panther linebacker Joe Carroll
wants to be on television.

He’s not a communications ma-
jor and hasn‘t any intentions of
becoming a movie star. It‘s just
that a television appearance
would symbolize achievements to
Carroll.

"Pitt would be brought back
into the national spotlight if they
would get on television." Carroll
remarked. “All the major schools
are on TV. Being on TV is the big
thing. It means you’re in the big
time.“

Carroll’s dream of stepping in
front of a network television cam-
era isn’t his only goal. He is aim-
ing for All-East honors and hopes
to corral five interceptions.

Had Carroll followed-up ' his
original intentions and had lent an
ear to his friends and relatives in
Warren. Ohio. his name might
have been almost synonymous
with national television.

“I was all set to go to Norte
Dame." Carroll said as he leaned
back and smiled. “I had just about
committed myself to Notre Dame.
But, after I made by second trip

there. I decided against it. I liked

the coaches here. and they told me
that I‘d be playing a rover de-
fense. Dave Hart made me feel
that we could become the Indiana
of '68." Carroll mentioned while
clasping his hands and still grin-
ning. '

(Notre Dame game films are
televised every Sunday. In addi-
tion. two live game—of-the—week

Krause Back

telecasts are usually presented
each fall.)

Since Warren is a Notre Dame
town, everyone was trying to point
Carroll in the direction of South
Bend, Ind. However, his individ-
ualistic attitude shielded him
against the stream of persuasion.

After a disillusioning freshman
year and a sophomore season in
which he shared the strong-side
linebacking chores. he is current-
ly at ease at short-side lineback-
er. Last year he constantly bat-
tled two blockers. This season. on
the other hand. he has the oppor-
tunity to prowl the field and to
utilize his speed. ‘

“Reaction is my biggest asset."
said the outstanding defensive
performer in last week‘s clash
with UCLA. “I can utilize my
quickness on blitzes and in pass
coverage. I feel that I can stay

ever. quick reactions sometimes’

hurt me. If I react too fast on
an option dive play. a hole can
easily open up.“

Although he captured the at-
tention of the press in the UCLA
encounter, he didn’t experience
any ‘exceptional sensation. To
him, it was a routine perfor-
mance. He had that elbow room,
that nomadic feeling that enables
him to batter an offense.

“I like playing short-side line-
backer." he said. “I appreciate
the chance to roam the field on de-
fense.“

Despite several sparkling spots
in Saturdays loss. Carroll consi-
ders it a mighty setback. He as-
pired for an opening victory in or-

  

der to affect a change of attitude
within the University.

“The students are still skepti-
cal. They’ve been told that we’re
going to be winners for too long,”
Carroll commented. “Winning the
first game means a lot. Momen-
tum is so important.”

Carroll's face expresses sin-
cerity when he says that the Pan-
thers are a talented team that can
go far—maybe all the way in front 1 I
of a television camera.

Want some more gripes? Our third letter writer, who

‘ - “Watching a football game at Pitt Stadium can be com-

 ,§p_ared to attending a soccer game in Argentina. We finally have
 ‘a winner at Pitt, but unfortunately too many fans are still losers.

It; seems that school spirit at Pitt is relatively non-existant.

,\ ~ .‘"'l'here was more cheering last spring during the panty-raid at
 "Tech than there was on Saturday against UCLA. It seems that
1' .  the only reason people come to games is so they can get drunk

_and be obnoxious around others. I don’t know about you, but I’m
tired’ of dodging bottles, ice cupes, apples, and fists while trying

 to watch a football game. ‘If you’re just coming to the game to

 Qthe "Banana Splits.’ I don’t need your aggravation and I’m sure

 The dormitory division of the intramural softball league appar-
ently doesn't seem very interested in participating. For the second

goalie Kerry Krause has his share of it. After being sidelined with a
broken leg as a freshmen and being put out of action by mononuceosis
and hepatitis in his sophomore year. his enthusiasm wasn’t dampened.
And he is now back for his second season as the booter‘s number one

    

goalie.

Krause chose the goalie position originally through “the process

of elimination." He enjoys the
role. however. because of the re-
sponsibility.

"It's the key position." he stat-
ed. “It's you against the other
team. but if a shot gets by its your
fault._

The pressure of the position is
felt most during corner kicks. It is
in this situation that the goalie’s
judgment is relyed upon heavily
to prevent the opponent from
scoring.

"Corner kicks scare me to
death. You have to make a deci-
sion." he explained. "You have to
decide whether to go out or stay
in close to the net. If you go out
you have to get the ball. or at least
get a hand on it."

Leaving the goal undefended
can have serious consequences if
the goalie fails to get control of
the ball.

“I think I played a good game.
but I hope to play better in the fu-
ture.“

Concerning the team's perfor-
mance. he stated. “I think the
team can play better. Akron awed
us a little. Their movements were
beautiful to watch from the goal.

I hope we don‘t meet another team \

like them. It was a shame to play
a team like that first.“

However, he would like a
chance to avenge the loss. “I’d
like to play well and get into the
tournaments just to play them
again.”

Krause began his career in jun-
ior high school during the eighth

grade. In high school his team was -

runner—up in the division.

related the opinion of team physi-
cian Dr. Smith. based on observa-
tions and X-rays of the knee made
after the game  i
and during prac-
tice Monday.
"Dr. Smith
thinks it might
be a tendon.
with nerve dam-
age." The Pan-
ther also offer-
ed the much
more destress-
ing possibility that the injury
might be one of cartilage damage.

The consequences of either pos-
sibility are hardly cheering. It is
certain that the Pitt All-America
candidate will sit out this week's
Baylor game. Based on the extent
of the damage done to the knee.
Cindrich and the coaches will de-
termine how soon he will be back
in action. If the damage is to the
cartilage then it is very unlikely
that the middle-linebacker will
see much more action during the
rest of the season.

"If it is cartilage damage I'll
have to have an operation." Cind-
rich commented. So far the X-rays
have shown that there are no

Bill Beall And
Baylor Bears

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor
Baylor head coach Bill Beall was told to expect a call from the
Pittsburgh football luncheon reporters at 12:30 p.m. yesterday. His
school’s Sports Information Director didn’t tell him that the appoint-
ment was for the Eastern time zone, though, so the writers at the
luncheon at Frank Gustine’s restaurant had to wait an hour to hear

from the Southern coach.

Beall also seemed to be a little late in congratulating Pitt foot-
ball coach Carl DePasqua on the job he did with the Panthers last

year.

“Anytime you start at rock
bottom you have to be. doing a
football

good job to win a
game,” Beall said.

The Baylor
coach should
know.

If anyone be-
-gan the 1970
season at rock
bottom it was
Bill Beall and
his Baylor
Bears. Beall re-
placed John
Bridgers after the 1968 season
and didn’t coach in a winning

 

. game through his first year.

This fall the Bears were
crunched, 38-0, by Missouri
in their first game and the
Texans appeared to be ready
to stay at the bottom of major
college football.

But Beall said winning one
game when at rock bottom is
a good job, didn’t be?

Well, he must feel some-
what satisfied now. Last week
his squad upset Army. the first
Eastern team the Bears have
faced since 1967. ~

Beall is a little unfamiliar
with Eastern foes—he pronounc-
ed the Pitt coach's name as “De-
Quasqua”— but isn’t willing to
assume that the Bears can han-

Linebacker

Torn Knee

didn’t swell up too much which is
a good sign. Either way there is
nerve damage, but that goes
away.” '

Yesterday Dr. Smith looked at
the knee again, but the results of
those observations are not avail-
able yet. Right now, Cindrich is
walking around with a brace on
his leg.

The injury itself occured on the
Bruin’s first play from scrim-
mage. Cindrich planted his left
foot in the new Astro-Turf, went
to turn, and tore his knee in the
process. “I never had much luck
with the Astro-Turf,” he said
later.

“If I get a chance to play on that
turf again this year I'm going to
have it a lot different," continued
Cindrich. “I‘ll have a different
pair of shoes. Either they'll make

me special ones or I'll file them I

down myself. I just» get too much
traction out there."

On the second UCLA series Sat-
urday, Cindrich tested the leg on
the field. It took him one play to
be sidelined again. “I never should
have gone out there again," the
linebacker commented later.

At present the Panther star is
really down. "I‘m living from day
to day. It's cost me some sleep-
less nights," he said. ""You work
out and lift weights all summer.
You run to keep in shape for foot-

ball season and thenall of a sud-

fden you're out

    

dle everyone from this area of
the nation.

Pitt, for example, could give
the Bears a few problems.

“Pitt's getting a football pro-
gram off the ground like us,"
he said. “But, of course, they've
got about two years on us.”

The Panthers may have some
time on their side, but this sea-
-son Baylor does have a victory.
And what a victory, according
to Beall, who has been with
many winning teams at Louis-
iana State and Rice—but never
with Baylor.

“I’ve won at L.S.U. and Rice,

and in some bowl games and

everything else. But nothing
like this (when the Bears reach-
ed their locker room after the
win over Army). These fellas
were waiting a long time for a
win. It was something unbe-
lievable.”

After Saturday’s game against
Pitt, Baylor doesn't play another
Eastern team until 1973. A win
over the 3-point favored Pan-
thers would warrant Beall‘s
pleading for extra Eastern foes
before the ‘73 pairing, which

happens to be with Pitt.

The luncheon was held at

Gustine’s yesterday for the final
time this year.

VVomen’s T

Chatham, 6-0, For 2nd Win

by JANET FRY

Pitt women's tennis team
crushed Chatham, 5-0, for its sec-
ond straight victory, Monday.

Chatham was considered one of
the team's three main rivals.
Wheeling and Slippery Rock being
the other two.

Mrs. Pat Blayden, the Chatham
coach, had only two remarks:
“Revenge is in my heart. I‘m sorry
we weren’t more of a challenge."
Last season Pitt lost to Chatham
once and tied the cross-city rival
once.

“Chatham doesn’t have as much
depth this year as last. Fortunate-
ly we do,” stated Dr. “Goldie”
Edwards, the Pitt coach. “We
have some strong players that
aren't even playing. Our girls
played a lot during the summer
and that really helped improve the
team.”

Pitt's team played a much
stronger game than they did
against C-MU last Wednesday.

Eileen Surdoval. a sophomore.
defeated Chatham's top player.
Judy Rea, 6-4 and 6-2. Judy,
who played with Pitt’s Elaine
Kingas in a Edgewood tournament
last summer, backed out of some
tough spots with good hits. How-
ever, Ei1een‘s consistent play
managed to kept the ball over the

net just one more time than her L

opponent.

“Last year» I beat Judy a lot
easier,” remarked Eileen.

Elaine Kingas, who plays an
aggressive game at the net, had a
6-1 and 6-3 victory over Sydney
Pool in the number two singles
match.

“Elaine played a much strong-
er game. She hit the ball a lot
harder than in the C-MU tourna-
ment," commented Dr. Edwards.

The ‘number three position in
singles was played by Joann Kot-

jan, who was Pitt’s top starter at
C-MU. She defeated Chatham’s
Della Synder in a 6-0 and 6-4
match. I

Joann, who taught tennis and
played for the township team in
Upper Marion Philadelpha dur-
ing the summer, played a slower
game than at C-MU.

Dr; Edwards remarked, "The
pressure wasn't as great as be-
fore. Her serve and ground
strokes have improved greatly.
There were a few errors but that
is to be expected.

Despite various "freak acci-
dents" Sue Baer, a sophomore at
Pitt, and Mary Swallow, a senior,
managed a 6-1, 6-1 victory in their
doubles match.

Mary turned her back to a play
twice at the cost of a few points
and Sue hit her in the leg with a
serve.

Mary remarked, “You can’t
even see the ball when Sue serves.
The ball speeds by."

Mary. described as a pouncer
at the net, also added that the
match was much easier than the
one at C-MU.

“We really psyched them out in
the beginning with our hard hits,”
beamed Maxine Lew and Mich-

ele Burtini. They won a 6-0, .6-0 ~

match in the number two doubles".

“We had three or four net rallys "
in a row. This combined with -
