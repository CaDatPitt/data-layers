A 23 year old Shadyside man has
been charged with setting a paper
ﬁre in the driveway of the
University Club an Thackeray
Streets and is the main suspect in
the campus police investigation of a
seriesrof ﬁres sent in the Student
Union late Monday night.

“Harry R. Ketchum is now
spending 72 hours in the Allegheny

'§2j”Counw‘Jaﬂ, awaiting extradition to

Connecticut, where he is wanted on
counts of receiving stolen goods,
theft and bail-jumping,”
Campus Security Investigator-

‘ ' Charles Brevard.

Ketchum was arrested by campus
policeman Mike Coyne as he was
alledgedly setting ﬁre to papers in
a trash container in the University
Club driveway, at 12:16 am,

.‘ apporximately 30 minutes after the

discovery of the ﬁres in the Union.
A University personnel first became
aware of the ﬁres in the Union at
apporximately 11:45 am as Union
Night Manager L.D. Sauvage and
Student Aide Bill Adams were

(following routine closing ‘proce-

dures. for the building.

“Bill was making a routine check
of the first floor, when he noticed
the fire outside the entrance to the
recreation room,” said Sauvage.
“He extinguished it and notiﬁed
me. At that-time the custodial staff
who had just gone to their stations

_ started neporting the other fires.”

Fires were set inside or in the hall
outside of rooms 320, 324, 702, 726.
In addition a bulletin board on the
second floor was set on ﬁre, and
records taken from room 800, pre

The grant from_ the Bureau. of

Campus Police

BY KEN GORMLEY

After serving as Acting Campus
Police Chief since February 1
Charles “Curt" Graham has been
named Permanent Chief of Campus
Police by Vice Chancellor Joseph
A. Dutton.

According to Graham, his primary
concern as new Permanent Police
Chief is to _“professionalize the
department in all of it's functions,"

and he has already started some of ‘

the programs aimed at accomplish-
ing this goal.

The rank of lieutenant has been
added to the police . force to
augment the’ number of supervi-
sory personnel, Graham said. The
first five lieutenants were officially
appointed during the past week,
giving the force - what Graham

_describes as “desperately needed

field supervision."

He has also introduced a training
program for the department which
provides continuous instruction in
criminology for all members of the
force, including himself. ' Graham
considers this essential to the
maintenance of a good force.
"Supervision and planning aren't
worth a damn without good train-
ing," he explained.

One aspect of Graham‘s depart-
mental renovation calls for a move
back to one of the most basic forms
of police protection.

since the advent ofthe automobile.

"1 like the idea of an _officer being
seen. it V has been fdemonstrated
.many times that a high visibility of
‘ _ police officers will .cu_t down ‘on__the

Graham is
convinced that on-the-street pa-
trolling is an invaluable practice

number of crimes. -Patrolling is a
sound police practice which I hope
to return to,“ he said.

The only obstacle the new Police
Cheif sees as a possible deterence

. of plans to continue modernization

of the force is the reluctance of
some members to accept the
changes. Graham, apparantly
confident that this will present no
major problems, commented,
“People in this kind of work tend to
be conservative." But when they
see the good these changes do for
the campus, they'll change. I’m
convinced- that all of our police
officers want to professionalize this
force as much as 1 do." ‘

Graham offered proof of this
assertation in pointing out the

  Reaction to

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

The taunting‘ and booing of
President Gerald Ford Monday.-at
the Hilton Hotel, was the first
-public reaction he has witnessed to
his controversial ‘announcement

-early Sunday that he was pardon-

ing former President Nixon for all
crimes he commited in the Water-
gate affair.

Perhaps the most bitter reaction
to the President’s decision was the
resignation “out of conscience” of
his personal friend and press
secretary J. F. terHorst.

Outspoken reaction came heavy

‘from both sides--supporters and

opponents. Criticism seemed to
dominate the praise, however, and
one newsman predicted when the
dust settled, the public outcry
might match that when ‘President
Nixon ordered Archibald Cox fired.

- President Ford, in Pittsburgh
Monday to address an international}
transit conference, proclaimed his
support for some limited federal
assistance for the daily operations .
of mass transit systems in majdr“
American urban centers. . i 

“The key here,” -Ford main-
tained, “is that federal ofﬁcials are
not involved in the‘ capital opera?

that decision." , 
M “There is a legitimate and major :;
role to be played by the Federal

Government in assisting urban

transit systems,” Ford said. “But!-;

that role must be carried "out 

partnership with states"and local H"

nijiiicial process had run its course,

-priate for a Presidential pardon.
; Although official reaction was not
‘entirely _spIit along party lines,
‘most Republicans supported Ford's
 action. Two staunch Republicans,
~ ‘Senator Barry M. Goldwater, and
' .George Bush, the Republican Na-
‘ tional Chairman, believed the
 former President had already suf-
 -, fered enough for his mistakes.
i " Bush added that the country would
"-be better off with all of Watergate
 behind it.
eiiji Many observors felt that Ford
 acted in compassion for the fallen
1 President, to spare him the anguish
 of a long trail, public embarrass-
Ksment, and possible conviction.
Ford gave, however, four reasons
 for pardoning Nixon in his an-
 nouncement address Sunday. The
' ex-president has already suffered
 enough, Ford said. Also, an
. adjudication of the offenses would
be a long and devisive experience
_ for the country, at a moment when
it is time for a new beginning. A
fair trail would probably be im-
' possible, Ford concluded, and in
any event, as an act of compassion,
he would probably pardon Nixon in

the end anyway. Soto avert all this
trauma, he was pardoning the
former president now.

It seems those supporting Ford's
decision justify it by citing humani-
tarian values. The ex-president
the verge of a
breakdown, they say, and for him
to endure a lengthy and humili-
ating trial would be unbearable.
Also, they continue, America had
had enough Watergate ‘and it is
time to leave the devisiveness
behind, and concentrate in unity on
the major domestic problems ‘a-
head. This, obviously, has been
the Ford attitude since the day he
took the oath of office.

Those calling the action unjust, do
so for various reasons. First of all,
they point out that many Watergate
defendants have been charged and
have served jail. sentences for
actions they took in the name of a
president, who would now be
completely free. Also, they ask
about the war resisters. “Is it fair
that these men who abandoned the
country for moral reasons not be
pardoned for their actions, while a
president who has obstructed jus-
tice is?“ Many senators are also
complainingthat the book on the
Nixon involvement is closed, and
now the public will never know the
truth.

Ford's action in the courts, on
technical grounds, but a Jaworski
spokesman has publicly said this
will not be done. So whether the
Congress, the special prosecutor,
or the American people like the
President's decision or not, they
will have to live with it.

ever. As one newsman put it

are not necessary for a woman’s
life or health became Pennsylvania
law Tuesday as the House voted
157-37 to override Gov. Milton
Shapp’s veto of the measure.

The senate overrode the veto
Monday.

The legislation follows last year's
US Supreme Court decision in
permitting abortions thoughout the
nine months of pregnancy if a
licensed physician believes the
mother’s life or health is endan-
gered.

But in other cases, a woman

program’s ﬁrst year and 18 in the
second,” ‘vsaid Perlman. He has
been contacted by a few medical
students interested in the resi-
dency so far and hopes to generate
more student concern.

Trends, toward increasing special-
ization amoung physicians in
recent years, coupled with retire-
ment of many GP’s, have present-
ed what Perlman terms a “crisis
situation.”

“A major problem in US medicine
is the decrease. in the number of
general practitioners. During the
1930’s, four out of ﬁve doctors were
primary care physicians but num-
ber have fallen off in these areas,”
Perlman said.

He explained that residents in the
program “will follow patients over

time, be responsible to them, and

become acquainted with aspects of
office practice they would not get in
traditional training for internists
and pediatricians.” Perlamn,
director of -the Ambulatory Care
Center of the University Health
Center, added that residents in
Pitt’s program will /gain more
experience in ambulatory care than
they would elsewhere.

the reasons is that, here, patients

There is debate in’ the medical
profession over whether a family

all medical’ fields as in the 1930’s

Local Group Calls

For US Severing
01‘ Chile Inleresls

Calling for an end to “a ﬂagrant
violation of human rights," the
Pittsburgh Committee for Solidar-
ity With Chile held a press confer-
ence at Pitt Monday as part of an
international protest schedule for
September 4-11.

The ad hoc committee met to
deliver a statement requesting the
immediate suspension of all US
militry and economic aide to
Chile’s junta government, an open
Senate investigation into the role of
US government and corporations in
last year’s coup and the provision
of emergency asylum in the US for
refugees from Chile.

The group asserted the US
provides the central support of
Chile's oppressive military junta,
which violates such basic demo-
cratic rights as free press, as-
sembly, association and'speech.

The newly-appointed chief ex-
pressed the hope that a moderniza-
tion of the police force will help
eliminiate the belief held by many
people that Campus Police are less
than competant. “It falls on us to
prove we're competant. If we act
like professionals, we’ll be treated
like professionals," he said.

As far as the general treatment of
the Campus Police by Pitt Stu-
dents, Graham hadno complaints.
"I think we're well received by the
students," he said. 1“We get a
very high level of support from the,
and ITm thankful for that."

Chief Graham, 29 was raised in
Etna, PA. ‘After completing four
years of study in business adminis-
tr'a'tion at Youngstown University

from 1964-1968, he wo_rked four
years for an ambulance corps as a
medical attendant. Graham then
returned to Pittsburgh in 1969 to
join the Campus Police« Depart-
ment, while continuing to pursue a
diversified curriculum of studies.

Graham now holds a degree in
Political Science from Point’ Park
College, as well as a Masters
Degree in Higher Education from
Pitt. ' The latter has enabled him to
be an instructor of criminology at
Indiana University since 1972.

After beginning his police career

Campus Police Hecicl Appointed  

in 1909 as a patrolman for the
Campus Police, Graham was soon
promoted to the Detective Section
of the police force. In 1973 he was
appointed training officers of the
department and remained at this
position until his appointment as
Acting Police Chief last February 1,
replacing Chief ' Joe Gil in a
revamping of the Police Depart-
mcnt by the University.

Members of the Campus Police
Force, when interviewed by the Pitt

- News, seemed to show a great deal

of approval for the changes Gra-
ham hs_already_ adopted, as well as
confidence in his plans for the
future. —

"There have been quite a few
changes made by Mr. Graham,"
said Officer Bart Stack, a Campus
Policeman for nearly three and a
half years. “Standards have
definately gone up. Because of this

and things like new training oppor- '

tunities, the morale of the force is
higher than ever. I'd say he’s the
best chief that's-been around since
I came to Pitt."

Officer Stan Lowe, one of the five
newly appointed lieutenants, sum-
marized Graham's performance.-
"He's pointing the Force in the
right direction."

uty and Responsibility

Though the majority of students leave campus. at the close of the
winter term, the daily business of the University affecting students
: continues throughout the summer mandating the active involvement of
'1 Pitt undergraduates’ elected representatives,the Student Government

Board. . '
 Of the seven members only SG President Mike Furick and Board
member Kim Loan had perfect attendance records at the regularly
cheduled meetings of the Student Government Board. Board
members Pat Kablack and Bruce Keeler also had admirable attendance
fecords ‘missing only two of ten meetings.
owever, the attendance records of the other three Board members,
th Weinbrom, Mary Heider, and Paul Hertnecky indicate beyond
unlit that these three elected representatives have shirked the
 lponsibilities they accepted when they ran for their respective offices
 January.

‘Duties of an SG Board member consist of actively representing Pitt
dergraduates at meetings with the administration and faculty,
"rseeing and directing Student Government's daily operations, 1
dependent pursuit and investigation of a single issue of interest to
be individual Board member, and a report of the Board members’
jctivities at the only "available forum, the regular meetings of the
tudent Government Board.

’Ifhe ending of classes last winter did not absolve Board members of
their"responsibilities. Attendance at Board meetings ‘is the least our
ted representatives can do to fulﬁll their commitment to their

coiistituents.

:l?h‘e’_,importance of such issues as the status of the Undergraduate

__,Academic Review, the closing of the Arsenal Family and Children’s

A enter, and the funding of the Pitt Hockey Club was not minimized by

,e— ending of classes last April.

Additionally, crucial issues developing over the summer of critical

portance to students merited the attention of all members of the

tudent Government Board. Contract renewal negotiations between

-Student Government and the Pitt News, and the probation order levied

 in Delta Sigma Chi fraternity by the Student Affairs Office demanded

he involvement of the total Board and not only the diligent efforts of
3-SG President Mike Furick.

It is in the best interest of students that-Student Government operate

it its maximum, but a Board lacking even the interest of its own

‘miners. can never function effectively.

Tﬁlwilggllliil is. the first meeting of the SGB this fall. None of the seven
me.-mlii.ers. should fail to attend this meeting or any other future
'i_neet:‘i-nigs. Those members no longer able to discharge their duties as
,the?y~ promised las.t winter should relinquish those posts now, so

 replacements willing to work for the benefit of all Pitt undergraduates

can assume the responsibilities of a Student Government Board

g member.

" And? ﬁnally, the three Board ‘members who failed to regularly attend

Board meetings this summer, Weinbrom, Heider, and Hertnecky, owe

their constituents an explanation fdr their absences. And we expect to

hear those- explanations at tonight’s meeting.

K, Secondly, it is now almost a cliche that no man is above the law. In

half the men, or most of the men. Mayors, senators and other high
~ . public servants have been charged and convicted for crimes against the
people. But men of high office merelv have more resoonsibilitv. not

Supporters of thepresi-dential pardon make vague reference to the
 Spain and anquish experienced by the former president and his family.

To be Dead and Oppressed  

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The Most exciting development
of this decade has been the rise of
one of the most oppressed minor-
ities in America today.

For years the ranks of the “De-
ceased” have been ignored by
public and politics alike. The US
government has only shown cur-
sory interest in these victims of
thanatoptic aparthied, making little
effort in the way of securing
Constitutional rights for the mil-
lions involved.

The numbers of the American
Deceased are estimated to be in the
10's of millions by most experts,
and yet there has been no outcry
for recognition, no destruction, no
riots.

The plight of the American De-
ceased has been effectively swept
under the rug by the System.

No group in American history has
suffered such open and wide-
spread oppression. Most De-
ceased, cut off from the outside
world in ghettos euphemistically
called “cemeteries” and “places of
rest,” never get the opportunity to
voice their feelings. _ .

Ex-President Nixon made perhaps
the first move toward recognition of

the Deceased as true Americans

on

during his 1968 campaign. In a
series of speeches aimed at the

“Silent Majority" Nixon called for
the Deceased to speak out against
the evils of liberal government.
They never replied.

Why? Because of harsh federal
laws requiring the sealing of all
cells or “coffins" as they are
called. Because of strict ancient
tradition which requires all De-
ceased to be back in their “cem-
cteries" by sun-up. Refused the
vote, denied the right to attorney or
even to a drink, the Deceased
remain powerless.

This tradition of oppression goes
all the way back to primitive man,
almost all the way back before
television.

Ancient man cast the Deceased
out of his "villages and homes,
because “all they do is lay around,
they never do any work,” “they
can‘t even read or write," “they
smell." «

_ Even today you will hear‘ the same

"basic prejudices in any corner bar.‘

No sooner is someone discovered to
be Deceased than his friendsrefuse
to speak with him and his wife gets
remarried and throws all his hunt-
ing trophies out.

But times are changing Mr. and
Mrs. America. In recent years

there has been an underground
movement among the Deceased to
achieve full equality in this coun-
try.

Looking to more progressive
countries, such as India and parts
of Africa where the Deceased
have long been in the majority,
American Deceased (or “stiffs” as
the prejudiced have branded them)
have found unity and spirit in their
numbers.

Many universities around the
country have been pressured into
offering courses on “Dead Cul-
ture.” Movements have been
successful in getting the Deceased
role in Western Civilization in-
cluded in grade school texts.

For instance, did you know the
reason Roland was killed by the
moors was ‘because he tripped
over Deceased Peirre of Dumar-
dain? Did you know that thousands
of Deceased participated in the
Revolutionary War, on both sides?

If it wasn’t for the billions of
Deceased in -the world right now,
we'd be up to our ears in human
beings! In fact, Charles Darwin
revealed in his amazing book
“Origins of the Species" that the
Deceased have played an important
role in the evolution of mankind!

Put that in your pipe and smoke it
Mr. Narrow-mindedll And that
isn’t all. While the Deceased have

generally followed a passive resis-.
A tance to the oppression‘ in this

country, more and more are be-
coming “radicalized.“

Following the example of the
famous 18th century urban guerilla
Count Dracula, hundreds‘ of De-
ceased are prepared to get up and
demand that they get their own
stake in America.

Yet, the government has been
slow to act. Until very recently it
looked as though any real progress
towards achievement of Deceased
equality would have to come far in
the future.

Some Deceased were prepared to '

wait for the Third World War,
which promised to swell the_ranks
of the Dead to a point where they
could no longer be simply buried in
the bureaucractic shuffle of Wash-
ington. Most . Deceased were
content to just “lay there" until
Doomsday. ‘

Then it happened. An astonishing
breakthrough. In a revolutionary
event that had the Deceased na-
tion-wide turning in their isolation
cells, President Richard Nixon
resigned and Gerald Ford became
our Constitutional Commander-in-
Chief.

Yes, in a glorious step forward for
realization of the Dead dream.of

o equality, Gerald Ford became the

first Deceased president of the
United States.

BY JOHN POULIN

111 a nation which spends ap-
proximately 3/5 of its current tax
dollar on past, present, and pro-
spective wars, the ways and means
of this government's drive for
peace, even its sincerity in trying to
reach that end, inevitably beg the
quesdon.

is there anything more that can be
done? Is the hope of building a
peaceful world a- realistic goal--or
an idealist’s dream? '

The Friend's Peace Center, an
adjunct of the local Quaker Church
on Ellsworth Avenue in Shadyside,
is a study and guidance center for
peace. Within several small rooms
on the upper floor of the Friends
Meeting House, accessible by a fire
escape, the Friends are not only
doing more for the cause of peace,
but helping to un-do obstructing
efforts.

"The Quaker Church," explained
manager of the Center, Willard
Mead, “is historically a peace
church. .lt's stood against war for
over 300 years." Throughout the
Vietnam War the Church funded
boat loads of supplies to the war
torn areas. "We were careful,”
noted Mead, “to divide half for
North Vietnam and half for the
South. We wanted them to know

‘that among the American people

some humanitarianism still
existed.“ Until 6 months ago,
Mead. said, when the US govern-
ment finally granted an export visa
for shipment to the North, it was
necessary to transport money
through Canada before shipment
could be readied.

_ Throughout the same period the

Center was active in draft coun-
seling. “Between 1969 and 1973,”
said Mead, “3,000 young men
went through this office. None of
these went to jail or had to go to
Canada.” Subsequent to- the end
of the draft the Center has helped
AWOLs, deserters, resisters, and
non-registrants‘ avoid the harshest
penalties and acheive amnesty.
President Ford's tentative offer of
conditional amnesty, Mead argued,
"isn't amnesty. Amnestye is a
wiping out--a forgetting. What he

proposes is a tiny little drop in the .

bucket.” Amnesty should be
granted not as a matter of fore-
giveness but for the good of the
country,” Mead-‘ said. He calls
this issue “one of the easiest areas
of disunity in this country that can
be righted.” And amnesty, he
argued further, would mean the
return of a signiﬁcant number of
contributing citizens.

"l foresee it (amnesty) as inevi-
table," Mead added. “Perhaps 2
years. l'd like to see it sooner.
livery single protest builds up in
the minds of people. And the
Judges have steadily become more
lenient. What was once a max-
imum 5 years, $10,000 fine has
become recently a 27-33 month
sentence." ,

Despite the end of America’s
compulsory draft, the Center is still
active in military counseling.
Believing “truth is the first cas-

uality in war,” the Center tries to.-

strip away the cloak of war in
recruiting propaganda. Among its
literature is the slogan: ‘Join the

Navy; travel to exotic, distant
lands; meet exciting, unusual
people and kill them.”

"Love thy enemy" is the Quaker
peace philosophy in its simplest
form. “Your best defense," said
Mad, “is a non-violent one. I'm 71
years old and have never been in a
light in my life."

Mead, a retired professor of
linglish literature at 'Shadyside
Academy, recalled the wisdom of
Shakespeare, “We all do hold a
mirror up to nature.‘ War can only
return war-—not peace."

“The avenue open to us,”_ Mead
said, “is civil disobedience. We,
as Quakers, follow the will of God
and not the country. When we see
something that is wrong, we must
act against it. Civil disobedience
was tried successfully in Denmark
during the Second World War.
Martin ,Luther King did it in
Alabama. We can’t prove it
internationally because it’s never
been tried.” -

But the principle work of the
Center at hand, according to Mead,
is the “education of the people of
the community in the achievement
of peace." Speakers working
through the Center have addressed
both churches and schools on the
use and methods of non-violence.
A radio hour on peace is heard
every Friday between 3-4 pm over
WYEP radio. The usual format is a
taped interview with a Congress-
man" which is then discussed on the
air by an authority from Pittsburgh.
Callers are invited.

Currently planned is a Week of
Concern during the second week of

By BILL HADUCK

It appeared through the smoky
Triangle morning that the Hilton
Hotel must surely be on fire. Fire-
men in their rubber coats were
running back and forth between
their truck and the building's en-
trance and a hydrantgave off a
splatteringe shower as the con-
nection between it and the hose
was put on. perhaps. in too much
of a hurry.

Too many bombs had been go-
ing off lately and I could put it
past no one, in this case, to go and
sabotage the hotel where Gerald
Ford was to speak in less than
four hours.

But drama seldom‘ happens
when you expect it and thefire-
men in all their excitement were
only filling oil drums with water
so the crowds in all their excite-
ment would not be able to knock
them over as Gerald Ford shook
hands along the red carptet work-
ers were now carefully putting

down.

“Press Bus Leaves for Airport
7:45 am.“ said the sign inside the
Hilton and a cop pointed it out to
me. “Over there.”

A string of people with cam-
eras and tape recorders were
boarding the bus laughing and
talking about “the last time I saw
Gerry.”

“I used to go up to him and just
say. ‘Oh. hi. how’re you doing?‘
and that was it.” said ond news-
woman from a small television
station. She fiddled with the tape
recorder that would soon try to
pick up the President’s voice.

“Yeah. things change too fast
anymore it seems.” said her com-
panion. _

The bus turned into the military
entrance of the airport and stop-
ped at the guard house. Imme-
diately a secret service agent,

with more declaration than ques-

the next gate that we were

“You’ll have to get your bags

searched,” the agent said looking '

downat the equipment crammed
bags and cases.

When we got to the police on the
hill. however. they just waved us
through. probably thinking all the
searching had been done at the
guard house. The first breach in
security had been committed and

though the President wasn’f due
to arrive for another 15 minutes.

Hard looking Secret Service
men walked back and forth out-
side the roped off press and spec-
tator area, watching for people
winding up time bombs or loading
guns, but everything seemed to be
in order except for a little black
briefcase standing next to one of
the rope supporting oil drums.
“Whose briefcase is this?” ask-
ed an agent. Several other dark-
suited men came over and the
agent asked his question again.
Instead of an answer all that was
heard was the whirr of cameras,
and the rustling of paper as the
news hungry reporters saw a pos-
sible story. Comments spread_
through the crowd. “It must be a

» bomb. Get away from it.” More

daring newsmen slipped in for a
close look, while others settled
for a possibly safer, but more dis-
tant vantage point.

No bomb squad appeared. how-
ever. as the agents decided some-
how there was nothing to worry
about and everyone went back to
watching the planes.

It was getting late. The plane ‘

was already 15 minutes late. It
seemed wrong to be upset about

l it. though. He was the President.

what if he decided to cancel the

just yesterday make that sure-to-‘

Watergate involvement? He sure
could avoid a lot of questions. let

, alone problems if he’d just stay in

Washington.

The spectator crowd was steadi- ‘

.ly growing. People laughed and
smiled and talked in nervous
tones. No posters were to be seen
and nobody seemed to mind wait-
ing. Perhaps the newspaper and
radio reports were wrong. Per-
haps Pittsburgh would not get up-

visible and a large four engine jet

» could be seen gliding downward.

As it neared. the bold lettering be-
came clear. Here was Gerald
Ford.

Immediately. a rope-side stand-
ing point became a precious thing.
People pushed and people shoved
and the click and whirr of a hun-
dred cameras could be heard'as
the plane touched down. ‘

There seemed to be a lack of
real fanfare, however. There was
no band preparing to play “Hail to
the Chief,” and no official«wel-
coming delegation appeared in
sight. As soon as the plane taxied
to its deboarding site and the
steps were rolled into place, how-
ever, a large motorcade formed
parallel to it and an onslaught of
local dignitaries emerged to greet
the President.

Pete Flaherty. County Commis-
sioners Leonard Staisey and Tom
Forester led the welcoming party
which lined up at the steps.

Then he appeared. It seemed
like nothing new. he‘looked the
same as he did in photographs.
but the people cheered anyway.
7 He acknowledged with a wave and
started down the steps. stumbling
a little on the third step. He seem-
ed human. He didn’t give the enig-
matic Nixonian gesture symboliz-
ing some ‘sort of victory at every
appearance. he merely waved and
stumbled.

Shaking hands seemed to come
naturally to the President and he
strods from the official gathering
to the waiting crowd which greet-
ed him with still more cheers and
hundreds of hands extended to-
ward him. ' '

“Hi. good morning. how are
you? Hi. good morning. howare
you?” He seemed to have a set
pattern to his greetings and hand-
shakes that somehow in all its
repetition still carried with it at

' least some sincerity.

Abruptly. with some suggestion

it seemed from the Secret Service

men all around. Ford turned from
the crowd and started toward the
motorcade and his Lincoln Con-
tinental limosine with American
and presidential flags floating on
the tenders. He gave one last
wave towhich the crowd gave one
last cheer. the loudest of all. and
suddenly he was gone.

The cameras dropped as the
press buses revved their engines.
They would be off in a minute he-
hind the motorcade and nobody
wanted to be left behind. The PAT
bus we had ridden out in had been
replaced with a brand new Grey-
hound just to keep up.

Parkway West. which had been
jammed with rush hour traffic
two hours before. was not prac-
tically empty. State Police had
stopped traffic on the entrance
ramps to provide clearance for
the motorcade and people from
the cars lined the roadsides hop-
ing for a glimpse of their leader.

Even they cheered. It was not
until the motorcade reached
downtown Pittsburgh that it be-

Inside the ballroom, the dele-
gates to the conference politely
listened to a New York transpor-

but a certain tension was in the
air as time was watched and fin-
gers tapped. ‘ ‘ '

One corner of the ballroom was
a mass of wires. television cam-
eras. movie cameras. still cam-
eras. recording equipment. and
nervous reporters. NBC commen-
tator ‘John Lord had to go through
a prepared report seven times and
even then he didn’t get it right.
The blue light glowing from the
monitors gave an uncertain light
to the darkened corner and slow-
ly the room grew silent.

Already on stage was the en-
tire airport welcoming party. bol-
stered by the appearance of Mil-
ton Shapp. Senators Schwieker
and Scott and many congressmen.
Then from a side door. he came.

The upshot of the current debate-
ramnesty is leading to one end,
cording to Pitt’s Director of
Veterans’ Affair Jack .1-Iayes:
aggravating tensions leftfover from
»the Vietnam war. . -
“"flt~keeps alive the same stereo-
typic divisions there were during
_th‘ej Vwar debate. There are the
same faces on both sides. People
from’ the Quakers and SDS are on
one side and people from the
American Legion and VFW are on
the other. .
—-_ Hayes said current discussions
really won’t lead anywhere because
neither side will be totally ac-
;cepted. On one hand, there will be
‘some form of amnesty, because the
Secretary of Defense and other of
President Ford's advisers have
-proposed amnesty plans. On the.
other hand, unconditional amnesty
i’ ‘unacceptable to too many of the
American people.
._.-Hayes feels the evaders will be
coming -back, one way or another.
“Those who really stood on princi-
pies and chose exile, for them
coming back won’t be satisfactory
under conditional amnesty. The
guys who will come back will be the
unemployed and the poor.
“Regardless, everyone who
' back is going to face hard times.
Their having. been draft "evaders
will come up for the rest of their
lives.”

“There were, of course, people
who successfully resisted the draft,
who said no to Vietnam. They went
into the courts and fought it, .
plugged away for so long, and got

-no final ruling.

"_‘But these were the educated
who had access to and money for
the process. What about theguys
who didn't have those tools?”

Asked about the distinction be-
tween draft evaders and deserters,
Hayes said, “A lot of people reject I
that distinction. But the deserters
and the evaders are under two sets
of laws, I don’t think they’ll get the
same treatment because the de-
serters may be fugitives of some
violent crime.”

Hayes also estimated more than
250,000 ex-servicemen have bad
discharges. “Some of these are
well-deserved, and I don’t see any
other way out for these guys than
facing the military review board.

“About 15 to 20 per cent of these
bad discharges are overturned by
the board. The process takes about
18 montlis to two years, so the
whole thing should be renovated."

Hayes praised President Ford for
his recent speech in favor of some
kind of amnesty. “It's a pretty
strong change from last year. No
matter what he comes up with,
though, there's going to be a group
who'll reject it.

tional amnesty with an 18-month

RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES/AC POWER

BY BRIAN DUNN

Draft evaders should be granted
conditional amnesty, according to a
slight plurality of 60 Pitt students
and faculty surveyed last week,
prior to . President Ford's an-
nouncement of a full pardon for
former President Nixon.

The subjects in the survey were
asked, “What sort of amnesty, if
any, do you think should be
granted to draft evaders?”

Twenty-seven respondents, or a-
bout 45% felt draft evaders should
be required to earn their re-entry
with most people listing the Peace
Corps, Vista, or non-combat
military service as an option.

, George McKenna, a senior chem-

istry major, said, “They could have '

obtained a conscientious objector
status, but they just took off. 1
think their payment should be
doing more like conscientious ob-
jectors had to."

Mike Madigan, an AFROTC jun-
ior, said those coming back should
have to work for VISTA or the
Peace Corps. ‘ ' ' , _

A middle-aged student, who '
asked to remain anonymous, said,
“Our husbands had to go and

serve, so we’ve been there once. It

was their duty.

just and we shouldn't have been

should be demanding anything,"
said Doug Marvin, a graduate
student in secondary education.
_“We should choose the conditions,
not them. If they want ,to come
home under those conditions, they
can. Some will choose not to
come." ‘

Subjects in the survey, or about 35

move to a different gate, _,one that
had been scouted out and revealed
fewer freaks in waiting. The gates
weréopen at 2:30 but rumors were
llying they’d ‘open much earlier and
in fact they did--at noon.

Thousands flew over walls into the
bowl of the stadium to get the best
seats. After jumping this center
field wall and running my ass offl
sat 20 feet or so in front of the
stage. What followed was indeed
history because of the acts present
and the quality with which they
performed. .

The sounds and ranges of music
were typical of the old style
concerts emanating from the West
Coast. As a matter of fact most of
them started there: Jesse with his
bounce and sunshine music fea-
tured “Lightshine," “T-bone
Shuffle" and the ever famous
“Sunlight;" Santana resurrected
songs from the ‘old band

Neshabur;". The Band, minus
Richard's keyboards because of
sudden illness,made their way
through "The Weight” and
"Smoke Signals."

David was on stage for the entire
concert. During The Band’s per-
formance we finally got a view of
CSN&Y. Energies rose. Neil was
dancing during “Don’t Do It’’
while Graham and Steven laughed
at him. I knew they were ready for
us. 0 Would we be as ready for
them? i

The sun was down, the moon was
rising, the stage lights had been

turned on. Now all was quiet. The

lights dimmed. Somebody walked
onstage, _and then another, and
another..'.they were here. Graham
walked over_to the mike and said

like.
“Soul Sacrifice" and “Incident At

with such sweetness and yet au-

thority, “Ladies and Gentlemen...
Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young!”
l he roar of an estimated 85,000
people echoed throughout Cleve-
land as the spotlights created a
sunrise on the boys.

Russ Kunkle, on drums, and Joe
Lala, on percussion started up a
Latin rhythm with Steven rubbing
his pick against the deaderied
strings...a sound familiar to all
CSN&Y fans from the LP’s to
concerts. Steven in a football
jersey, shining a number “7,”
jumped to the mike and sang “Love
the One You're With." David and
Graham's high top Converses
bounced around with harmonies
while the Loner sat at the organ.
Behind a pair of sunglasses, in a
Buick repair shop jacket and under
Graham's fishing hat, Neil smiled
and admired the fans. "

Suffice it to say naming every
song from a three hour show would
be long and‘ boring, but the
three hours weren’t...of ‘course.
Highlights of the gig ranged from a

piano solo by Neil during “'Deja-

Vu” to an electric guitar solo by
Steven in “Lee Shore.” Two un-
recorded Neil Young songs were
played--“Traces” from the album
“Tonight’s the Night” which was
scrapped'and “Maui Mama”
hopefully from a new CSN&Y LP.
Steven played piano on a solo piece
which is possibly his finest tune
since “To A Flame” and also did
an electric piano song with the rest
of the band. i
"Almost Cut My Hair” was a
moving, crushing and’ yet beautiful
tune where the famous guitar
battle "routine of Stills and Young
that hasdelighted so many was

reenacted. Despite those sun-
glasses Neil cooked and let us see
him in a very personal way--his
expression of a musical piece that
brought him to a frenzy.

The opening electrics was jux-

taposed with a wooden set that had
“Only Love Can Break Your
Heart" turned into an a Capella
chorus and “Our House‘ into a
bedside story that was as heart-
warming as Winnie the Pooh. It
was climaxed with a Crosby, Stills
and Nash “Suite:Judy Blue Eyes"
with Young coming in on the last
few verses during the acoustic solo.

1"‘

The second ele_ctric set was set in '=

motion with “Walk On” from
Neil’s “On the Beach” and ended
with “Carry On” in which Neil
played organ and then jammed
with Steven on guitar. Steven and
Neil were at times rubbing each
others instrument as David head

Pgh. Filmmakers Move to Oakland, Offer Filmsi

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

The Pittsburgh Film-Makers, Inc.
(PFMI), an organization working in
the areas of cinema and photo-
graphy has moved to a new location
at 205 Oakland Avenue and will

‘offer courses in filmmaking and

V Haller added

photography
students.
PFMI is an organization providing
darkroom and film production fa-
cilities to members, offers college
curricula in cinema and photogra-
phy and presents programs and
activities to increase public under-

{O

‘ standing of the cinemagraphic and

photographic mediums, according
to PF Ml president, Bob Haller.

the PFMI is a
non-profit, tax exempt group which
has recently moved from an East

University-

Liberty location to" part of a
building comples made available
by the General State Authority in
cooperation with the University and
Oakland Development, lnc., an
Oakland community group.

“The new space will include a 70
seat screening room, "a photogra-
phy gallery where artists can
exhibit their works and an exten-
sive non-lending ﬁlm library,"
Haller said.

PFMI Treasurer Victor Grauer
pointed out the new location should
be more easily accessible to Pitt
students who attend courses there.

According to Grauer, an agree-
ment. has been made with, the
University to allow credit to be
given to a limited number of

’ students who ‘take PFMI courses.

‘from the Gulf Foundation,

Chatham and Point Park Colleges
also have similar arrangements.

Haller said the PFMI is supported
by members’ dues and by grants
the’
Hillman Foundation, the A.W.
Mellon Education and Charitable
Trust, the Pennsylvania Council of
the Arts and the National Endow-
ment for the ARts.

Membership in PFMI is open to
anyone with an interest in film of
still photography. According to
Haller, dues are $100 per year for a
full membership which_includes the A
use of all facilities, $50 for a limited
membership which includes use of
super-8 and still photography facil-
ities and $35 for a limited member-
ship that includes the use of the

« still photography facilities.

vital to every concerned person

who either attends schools or is
employed at the University.

Am I'm sure you remember a few
years back there was a serious
confrontation between students at
the University and the City Police.

A number of innocent people were -

seriously injured, and their records
and reputations were severly
damaged by the manner in which
the situation was handled. In other
words the head busters were called
in.

I believe it was a direct quote from
the V present chancellor of Pitt
University that no city police were
to ever be called. The Univeristy
Police could handle it. Those may
not be his exact words but I’m sure
that’s pretty close, and if you would
ask anyone who was around then
you would come up with the same
thing. V

Well, 5 Lieutenants positions
were formulated for the police
department of the University and 3
of those positions were ﬁlled by city
police ofﬁcers. It is also rumored
that 15 other part-time positions
are to also be formulated and to be
ﬁlled by City Police Ofﬁcers. It is
possible that the city police ofﬁcers
could ﬁt into a campus enviroment,
to understand and work to solve the
problems of the average student,
but it is also possible and far more
likely that they cannot. Are you
willing’ to take the chance on a
recurrence of the past? Iiask you

people, Ford said, adding that the
funding must be viewed only
secondarily‘ as a means of stimulat-
ing the economic growth of the
country’s urban areas, or increas-
ing central city density.

"Federal, taxpayers just can’t
afford to pay for the whole pack-
age," the President said. “I won’t
ask them to. Washington will help
with funding, but that fund_ing
must haveirealistic restraints.”

Without being specific, Ford said
he did not like the program
structure of the House-passed
Federal Mass Transportation Act of
1974, which proposes $11 billion be
appropriated over the next six
years for capital projects

and rural areas.

The bill was passed by the House
August 20 by a 324-92 vote. Before
passing the measure, in what was
called a major victory for President

- Ford in his battle against increased

government spending--his chief

-tool for stopping inﬂation--the

House slashed the appropriation
from $20 to $11 billion.
While continuing massive federal

and "
. operating subsidies in both urban

aid for mass transit capital pro-
jects, the bill also provides federal
operating subsidies for the _ﬁrst
time.

Fifty-four per cent of the $11
billion total would be allocated to
six nietropolitin areas that already
have rail mass transit systems in
operation, as well as to three cities,
including Pittsburgh, which have
received federal"grants to begin
construction for such‘ systems.

The House bill traveled to the

Senate, where it is presently in the

_ Housing and Urban'Affairs Com-

mittee. In addition, Senators

Lloyd Bentson of Texas and Har- ' 

rison Williams of New Jersey have
both introduced similar bills. The
Senate is expected to cut decisively
on the measures before the 94th
Congress convenes January 1975.

Ford, who sprinkled his remarks
with compliments to _ Pittsburgh
and its ownmass transit system,
was met by angry crowds protest-
ing his pardon of former President
Nixon as he entered and exited the
Hilton Hotel Monday, one month’ to
the day Richard Nixon resigned the
presidency, and Ford took the oath
of office.

Johnny Majors yesterday, speaking
at the opening press luncheon of
the 1974 season. “Potentially, we
can be better than last year, but
that depends on the improvement
we make during the season.”

Majors hasn’t been happy with
the performance of his players in
practice so far this year. Bad
weather hindered the Panthers’
progress at camp in Johnstown and
finally forced the team back to the
turf in Pitt Stadium where the
footing is somewhat better.

.111 addition to the rainy weather,
Pitt has also been held back by
some nagging injuries to key
players. The offense has suffered
to a large extent with injuries
forcing dailv changes in the offen-
sive allignment. The result was a
lack of cohesion and poor timing by
the offense as a whole. _

[Dave] Janasek, [Tony] Dorsett,

and [ Bruce ] Murphy all had ham-
pering injuries,” Majors
commented. “They were not even
inthe same backfield till last week.
[Renold] Stoner and [Joe] Stone
were out the last two days,» and
Mike Carey just recently came

. back. It takes more time to develop

the offense and get the timing
down.” » ‘

Defense and kicking game will
hold you together until the offense
jells," Majors continued. “That's
the way it will be this week. A big
factor is a simplified game plan.
We learn alot about ourselves in
the first game. On , paper
everyone thinks we'll beat Florida
State."

One of the big reasons why
Majors can express such confi-
d€1‘lC€l.l.lJ_,hl_§r defense is the play of
monster back MTEETBDTWIUWVHO was
also in attendance yesterday.
Bulino has consistently been the
squad's hardest hitter. Against
West Virginia last year, he single-
handedly wiped out starti_ng.quar-
terback Abe Dillon and back-up
Chuck Fiorante with outside blit-
zes.

Bulino is a natural leader on the
defensive squad. His performance

"There are eight of us back
together again for another year,”
Bulino said. “We know pretty well
what we’re doing out on the field.

We're just working on improving _

51

our skills right now.

Although the Panthers will be the
favorites in Saturday's game, they
can't afford to be overconfident.
The situation is similar to that of a
year ago when the enthusiastic Pitt
team traveled‘ to Georgia and
surprised the Bulldogs with a 7-7
tie. Florida State is in much the
same position this year, and coach
Majors warned against taking the
Seminoles lightly.

“There is a lot of enthusiasm at
Florida State,” Majors said.
“Their seniors do not want to go
out losers and the young people,
who may not have had a good look
last year, will want to be made
familiar with their new coach
[Darrell Mudra].

"Mudra has been very success-
ful," he added. “I don't underes-

timate him, he's a smooth opera ’

tor. His team is well-coached and
they execute well.”

Perhaps the toughest year for any
coach is the second year, and
Majorscertainly has his work cut
out for him this year. If the
Panthers can stay away from the
costly mistakes of the inexperien-
ced this Saturday, his job won’t be
quite so tough.

Murtaugh Cool A
 As Bucs Burn

I BY DOM GLIOZZI

As they sank below mediocrity
they remained calm. Battling out
of the cellar they remained calm.
Currently leading the Eastern Di-
vision of the National League, they
are still calm. One might say the
Pirates are a calm team.

-. “It’s just the nature of our

‘ ballclub,” explained the calmest of

wt‘,-‘

“:1Fugh.'
jhe Pirates are not a

them all Manager Danny Mur-

very

 ‘excitable ballclub and it all stems

from the old Irishman.

In the
dugout or rocking gently in his

’pfl‘ice after a game, Murtaugh

gun.

remains so passive it defies any
form of description a journalist
could offer. Danny’s outlook rubs
offor. his players and it keeps them
level—headed during hot streaks.
This patience howevergproved to
be even more valuable earlier in
the season, keeping the team from
jumping off the deep end as they
struggled up the Eastern Division
’ ladder.

‘,, .e‘Bucs played .700 baseball after

the much celebrated July 14 free-’
for-all with the Reds. The starting
pitching had been consistent all
season long but it was at this point‘
that the familiar booming bats
began tohappear. The fearsome
hitting coupled with the re-emer-
gence of Dave Giusti proved to be
the missing ingredients the Pirates

', ' ‘gd been looking for earlier in the

I \

‘.

season.

The Bucs took undisputed posses-
sion of,first place during a late
August swing of the West Coast,
usually a barren land for the
Pirates in past seasons. Returning
for a six game homestand earlier
this month, Danny’s boys blasted
the oncecontending Phillies and
totally surprised the Expos, swe-

’~gping all six games and grabbing a

firmer hold on first place.
One often overlooked aspect of

_' this Pirate drive is Murtaugh‘s
- crafty platooning of Bob Robertson

 



and Ed Kirkpatrick at first base.

The climb was long but sweet as‘

Both have performed capably de-
fensively, but more important,
their RBI-AT BAT ratios are out-
standing. '

After last Sunday’s sweep of the
Expos both players had combined
totals of 413 plate appearances and
73 RBI. It works out like this,

obertson knocks in a run in every
4‘/2 AT BATS while Kirkpatrick
drives in a tally once in every six
plate appearances.

    

DANNY MURTAUGH

With players such as Robertson
and Kirkpatrick, it’s hard to pla-
toon based solely on statistical
performances. With regard to two

first basemen, Danny admits, ‘I .
- have played hunches. It’s not hard

to see why.” . »

So, the Pirates play on, ravaging
opposing teams with their fine
pitching, outstanding hitting and
tight defense. Chances are good
they will win the National League
crown and possibly even the World
Series. If they do, remember, they
will have done it calmly.

BY BART MACK
Sports Editor
Despite being caught in the
bureaucratic red tape of a political
disagreementbetween Student
Government and the Athletic
Department, The Pitt Hockey Club
has begun formulating plans for
the upcoming season with the full

‘knowledge that no ﬁnancial sup-

port from the University currently

exists.
Athletic Director Cas Myslinski

I has maintained the Athletic De-

partment can not afford to fund
hockey while the Student Govem-
nient Allocations Committee re-
commended that the Club be
refused funding, a recommenda-
tion the Student Government Board

I accepted last spring.

According to Assistant Director of
Student Activities Lori Seamen, the
Hockey Club did not re-submit a
budget for reconsideration over the

summer months. She is absolutely
correct.

It seems a grave communications
gap has developed between the
Hockey Club and Student Govern-
ment to the point that no officials of
the Club were aware the need for
re-approachment of the Allocations
Committee even existed.

Call it an ignorance of parliamen-
tary procedure on the part of
Hockey Club officials if you will,
but I can only interpret it as a direct
attempt by Student Government to
avoid the issue.

Last spring, after the initial
recommendation was handed down
by the Allocations -Committee, I
met with Student Government
President Mike Furick, Myslinski,
and Alan Moidel, then the
treasurer of the Hockey Club.
After considerable discussion, in
which the Athletic Director made
his stand, Furick stated (vowed?)

he would devote some of his
precious ( and I acknowledge it)
time to the securing of funds for the
Club from another facet of the
University, if not the Athletic
Department.

At that time, Furick spoke to me
quite frankly in a conversation
which he wished to be considered
“off the record.” I feel at this late
date, however, the contents of that
conversation are directly pertinent
to the student body. I won’t even
attempt to quote Furick’s exact
words at the time, but the plain
facts and assurances he gave me
are still unmistakably clear in my
mind.

The main problem at hand, he
assured me, was that the Hockey
Club and Student Government had
to get together in order to put
pressure on" the -Athletic Depart-
ment to come up with some kind of
financial commitment, of any

. denomination.

Personally, I did not support
Furick’s arguments at any time and
I still don’t. But at that time,
Furick assured me that if all else
failed, Student Government would
be there to bail out the Hockey
Club with some minimal allocation,
such as the $3000 begrudgingly
awarded in 1973. With that
statement in mind, I sat back and
waited for the efforts of Furick and
Student Government to reap some
benefits from the ‘ ‘other channels”
of the University. ‘

Toward the end of the summer
session, as president of the Hockey
Club, I attempted to set up an
appointment with the Allocations
Committee concerning the status of
the Club’s budget and just what
Student Government was doing
about it. It was then the last week
of July and I was informed that the
Allocations Committ would not be

7 in session for the remainder of the

summer after July 29.

My attempts ground to a halt

5

when I was informed that Seamen
was on vacation and without her
the meeting could not take place.
Still, I was reassured by Furick that
August and September would not
be too late to receive allocations.

But just yesterday I was informed
that the Allocations Committee
hasn’t given one minute of positive
consideration to the funding of the
Club over the ‘summer months.
Once the original allocation recom-
mendation was passed by Student
Government Board, the issue
apparently became dormant.

A re-approachment of Furick
produced only criticisms of the
Hockey Club’s budget research
policies for 1973. He passed the
buck on to Seamen.

With 98% of their monies
distributed, the Allocations Com-
mittee must now be re-approached
by the Hockey Club with the same

budget that was ﬂatly refused six “

months ago, or a revised edition.
Next Tuesday night at 7 pm in room
300 ‘of the Student Union, the
Hockey Club will make a ﬁnal plea
for Student Government support.
If Furick and his “governmental
associates" (and I use the term
lightly) think that another budget
refusal. is the answer and .put
Myslinski in a compromising
pOS1t10n, then perhaps the Student
Government offices should be
moved. to South Craig Street and
incorporated with the ofﬁces of the
Western Pennsylvania Association
for the Blind (no pun intended).
The Hockey Club held an
organizational meeting last Sunday
in which Dr. Michael Sherman, the
Club’s ever-working faculty advi-
sor, unveiled the plans for the
1974-75 season, including a 30
game schedule which will raise the
credibility of the team to ‘ new
heights. Add . to that three
practices per week until the end of
October, a must to condition the

competition. Sherman also has in
the works a Pitt Invitational-

Tornament this fall and plans to
compete in at least two others.

A minimal contribution from a
governing body which deals out
thousands to other clubs without
blinking an eye would only be a‘
basis and a foundation. The
Hockey Club already has started

A two fund raising projects which, if

completely successful, would dou-

If that isn't enough, the Dolphins
have one of the better defenses in
the league, including the likes of
Manny Fernandez, Bill Stanﬁll,

Buffalo, wont be simply O.J.

say that Juice won't gain a lot of

ing 1973 showing.

The Bills have the material this
year to diversify and that is what
Coach Lou Saban must do if Buffalo
is to stay within sight of the
Dolphins and have a shot at the
wild-card playoff berth.

Young Joe Ferguson, along with
veteran Scott Hunter, are both
capable of moving Buffalo through

Ahmad Rashad and Bob Chandler

It’s really a toss up as to who will

ﬁnish third, fourth and ﬁfth in the:

The Jets have not been competi-
tive in recent years because of a
porous defense and Joe Namath’s
injuries.

This season the team starts out I

with Namath. as healthy as his

brittle legs will permit and hopes
that the addition of-big Carl
Barzilauskas will bolster the
defense. Unfortunately, however,
the only Winner on the team could
be Charley, the new coach, and
son-in-law of Weeb Ewbank, who
gave up the coaching reins after
last season but will remain as
general manager.

EXPERIENCE  

the priceless ingredient .   

On April 6, 1974, Larry Gold, a Pitt YMCA probation volunteer,
had the EXPERIENCE of rescuing his probationer and.four other
children in the family from one of their parents, who had gone
berserk. For his quick thinking and responsible action, Larry
received a commendation from Judge Maurice B. Cohill of
Juvenile Court..His EXPERIENCE in "Juvenile Volunteers in Ac-
tion" will be a stepping-‘stonefor him to grad school, to a
profession, to a career.

melted away when Lux was told he
made it, along with two other free
agents. ’ ‘

He was used sparingly this year,
playing behind the league's all star
center forward (target man), Jim
Fryatt.

“Fryatt taught me so much,”
Luxbacher said, introducing a side

of professionalism the public rarely

sees.

"Everybody got along great.
Tean1mates always helped each
other despite the intense competi-
tion." .

The player-n1anagement was a bit
different.

“We got along, but it was more of
a mutual respect than a buddy-
buddy type thing. If they didn’t
need you, then they simply got rid
of you.” _

professional athletes upon
Occasion, the Upper St. Clair
resident seemed unperturbed.

. ‘‘I knew I (wouldn't ‘get released

during the season, because they
(Coach Al Miller and other pros)
told n1e I had potential.”

Joe is just as optimistic about
being signed for the" upcoming
season, which runs April through
August, even though management
is searching for talent in Europe, a
situation hastened by the Atoms’
third place finish in their four team
division. Lux blames the new
NASL tie-breaker rule.

“By normal European rules,
where the team gets points for ties,
we'd have finished first. Now they
have a penalty kicking contest to
serve as overtime, but the loser in
that round lost out On overall game
points."

Philly lost all but one of their
"overtime" games, whereas
Miami, the division’s eventual
winner, was victorious in all their
regular season extra sessions.

Luxbacher is happy with the
success of, the league,‘ a set-up
which floundered so miserably in

_the late 60’s.

"League attendance was at least

doubled this past year, and for 1975 -

the league is adding two new teams
(Tampa and San Antonio), and
possibly five," Lux said. ' “Phil

Joe talked of the intrinsic dif-
ferencesin a subtle game such as
soccer On the pro and college
levels. , .

“There is more disciplined play in
the pros, and definitely the game is
more physical up there. Someone
is always marking you closely.”

A new experience for Joe was the
sudden recognition and adulation

which greeted him in Philadelphia. ,

He handled the exuberant fans as
easily as he handled clinging
defensemen. -

There is no rest for eith Joe in his
Off-season. I-le’s working out with
the Pitt soccer squad while helping
Leo Bemis coach the team, and
taking some education
prepare for a possible teaching
career.

_“I’d like to stay in the league as
long as I can play,” Luxbacher
said. “I want to stay in Philly, but
if I can play somewhere else, I
will.”

Interested in environmental fields
(Joe graduated with a B.S. in
biOlogy.), the first pro soccer player
ever from ~ Pitt contemplated his
future after soccer.
