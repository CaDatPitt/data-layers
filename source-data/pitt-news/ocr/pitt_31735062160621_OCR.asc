A second poll concerning trimesters has been

I conducted to see if additional information and

thought given to the subject since the program
was proposed has affected student opinion. I
Twenty-ﬁve percent of those questioned re-
fused to comment because of inadequate knowl-
edge of the plan or an unwillingness to be quoted.
Another 25 percent opposed the proposal out-

 right. Of the remaining half about 35 per cent

expressed favorable attitude with reservations,
however. Less‘ than 15 percent favored the plan
as it stands. Previously, opposition amounted to
a ﬂat 66 percent.
Some of the attitudes expressed are as follows:
Louise Sprajcar, Col. ’59, “I am in favor of trimesters
because they are not mandatory and will be an oppor-

. tunity to get ﬁnished school quickly. One drawback, how-

ever, could be that jobs may be harder to get for younger
people.” 1 7
Nadia Derkach, Col. ’60, “They are fine as long as
they’re not compulsory.”
Edward Sowinski, Bus. Ad. ’59, said that he is for
the plan because he is a veteran and would like to get
his degree as soon as possible. He added that in the past

summer work was hardly possible, but now a student‘

can choose between school and work.

Pat Battaglia, Col. ’61, “It’s good for its purpose which I

is getting students through. As long as it’s not compul-
sory I think it's all right. Some people objectthat their
college life would be shorter, but they’ll be on campus
the same total length of time.” _ '

‘Harriet Olson, Col. ’60, “I didn’t agree at First, but
after the meetings I see possibilities especially, for vets
and graduate students. It will take care of the influx.”
She wondered about the risk of not getting back in be-
cause of lack of room after having droppediout for a
period.

William Blair. Col. ’60, is against the idea. “It’s too
much of a push on students to go three trimesters.
There would be too much pressure on the faculty, es-
pecially graduates who are teaching.”

Jerry Hammill, Col. ’6l, thinks it is a good plan to
accommodate all thse who want to attend college, but
that it will be hard on those who must work.

Ralph Mucci, Engr. ’60, “It’s not a good idea because
half the students won’t attend for three consecutive tri-
mesters.” '

Ted Ristoff, Col. ’60, stated that although having a
whole trimester‘ off would create a longer working period,

Robert Szafranski, Engr. ’58, doesn’t think that it will
be possible for the University to offer all the courses
every trimester.

Sally Nelson, Col. ’59, believes that it will ruin the
spirit of unity of the classes and prevent organizations
from working effectively with students entering and
leaving at different sessions. ’

Jim Renn, Col; ’58, favors the idea since few jobs
are available in the summertime. Students could ﬁnd
more work in the winter such as in resorts in Florida,
etc. I 0

Rita Natale, Col. ’60, expressed deﬁnite opposition to
trimesters. “There is something to be gained in matur-

« ityover four years which will be missed if the student

~I~
is out of school in less time.”

Alayne Coleman, Ed. ’59, said that she doesn’t like

being rushed through an education.

Robert Watford, Ed. ’58, is for the plan as long as it I

is voluntary because it will enable a student to complete
his work in a shorter period of time.

Robert Rosenfeld, Bus. Ad. ’59, is in favor of trimes-
ters if not compulsory because all courses would be of-
ferred each trimester. _

Robert Price, Col. ’6l, and Aaron Lupovitch, Col. ’60,
feel that it is good as far as the University is concerned
because it can take in more students. Lupovitch added
that the plan was presented too quickly and caused a
turmoil.

MY   1956 Indianapolis Speedway Winner
“My closest shave was at Indianapolis in 1953,” says’
Pat Flaherty, 1956 Indianapolis winner. “The track
temperature that day hit 125° and the exhaust fumes
hung right down on the speedway. I was going into the
north turn at 130 mph when the fumes got me. I
blacked out, hit the outside concrete fence, and
skidded along for 120 feet. The car was demolished,

The University, Inc.

By Millard Amdur

Faculty members have ex-
pressed thcmselves to students
, freely on the trimester plan and
it certainly appears that a good
many are deﬁnitely not in favor
.of the prbgraiii
in any form.
Others ask for
revision of cer-
tain aspects of
the plan.

The faculty.
after all, is the
most important
element affect-
ed since t h e y
remain as stu-
dents come and
go’. The booklet5
sent to the members of thevfac-
ulty conveniently omits to men-
tion the disadvantages of the
program for faculty members al-
though a profusion of advantages
is discussed.

The duty of the committee was
to look into the feasibility of the
program which certainly in-
volves a clear statement of dis-
advantages even if only to re-
fute them. This disregard has
been mentioned by many.

Appearance Deceptive
Although ‘it might appear to
members of the administration
that the ‘faculty is backing the
program because they acquiesce,
it is doubtful that thisis the case.
The faculty feels, however, that
it is useless to protest as the
University policy is already set.
One faculty member stated
that after a full discussion in his
department, had there been a
vote, the trimester program
would have been turned down
unanimously. '
. c The curricular problem is one
about which the faculty is con-
cerned and is certainly qualiﬁed
to discuss. Some faculty mem-
bers ‘fail to seeihow the Uni-
versity .can make a total curric-
ulum effort with the present re-
sources available. They question
the feasibilityi of presenting
courses in sequence without
making the student attend every
trimester. « ..
Particularly in the laboratory
sciences,
massive problem. Some faculty
members have remarked that the
administration has given no in-
dication that it is ready to take
up the curricular problem and
new excessive costs.

Costs Prohibitive
And this problem of costs is

ianother, worry of the faculty.

They are certainly pleased with
the advances made in faculty
salaries since the advent of the
new era, but they question the
‘availability of funds to continue

Nis program and to meet, at the

 

this might ‘present a,

same time, the so—far unconsid-
ered expenditures of the trimes-
ter program. A

At ﬁrst" sight, members of the
faculty were‘not disturbed by
the 1,4; increase in salary for
‘‘1,/;»,’’ increase in yearly time
spent. But upon further exam- -.
ination, some question if this is\
not a 33‘/;% increase in salary
for a 50% increase in work load,
in other words for another full
trimester.

They question how many of
their members will be included
in the highly desirable two tri-
mester teaching—one trimester
research program and tend to
conclude not more than a few.

It has already been announced
by the chancellor that tuition.
will not go up next year. Stu-
dents and faculty have seen no
announcements of endowment
increase of any substance to
meet this new cahllenge.

And state aid will most prob-
ably remain constant for the
next year. Where then will the
money come from to pay for an
expanded faculty and an in-

C crease in research f/acilities?

Calendar Divergent

The proposed new ‘calendar-
has been termed unwieldy at
best. It sets Pitt in a schedule
vastly divergent from any of the A
other schools in" the nation. Will
visiting professors be willing to
come at our irregular times from
their town universities?

~ And on the other hand, could V
any of Pitt’s professors spend
time as visiting teachers in other
universities for a period that,in-
volves half of one trimester and
half of another?

Other suggestions for calendar
changes by the faculty included
the already common quarter
system and two eight week sum-
mer sessions.

A summer

school program

would involve few changes in ,

scheduling. The regular school
year from late September, to
early June would be continued
anda pair of eight week sum-
mer sessions for those anxious
to ‘accelerate would follow.
The quarter program, if adopt-
ed, would be similar to many al-
ready in existence at universi-

ties as close as Ohio State. This

program of scheduling was dis-
discussed by the trimester com-
mittee and some of the conclu-
sions follow.

They don’t like the four ‘regis-
trations necessitated by either of
the ‘alternatives instead of the
three under the trimester pro-
gram. They believe that . the
length of time is not sufficient
in each’ summer semester or.
quarter for deep thought» and

patchworktteaching and learning .

 'Edu.cafion_  Transition . .

by A. Whitney Griswold, presi- S

   

lWhere ls Le”arning's Door?

(Edito'r’s Note: This-is the third of a series of
columns on contemporary education in all areas
of Pitt.)

By David Breciksione

Transition is a potentially dangerous time. Often,
it is said, a period of change is worse than the
original situation and not as good as the eventual
goal. , _ '
If there is any truth in this claim, the Univer-
sity’s changing character should be surveyed
thoughtfully to reduce the lag
between actuality and ideal. 

A university has been termed 
“a' group of men devoted to _
learning on the highest plane of V".
intellectual and moral integrity,”

dent of Yale University. 
To what degree. does the
undergraduate academic life of
the University of Pittsburgh ful-
fill that specification? In at
tempting to explore this ques-
tion, I shall present a series of observations which
can be the basis for more intensive, thoughtful

   

 

~ discussion.

A simple way to investigate‘ the learning process
is to ﬁnd out what students are talking about. A

i great percentage of the time, ’most Pitt students

discuss ‘everything except what is going on in the
classroom. T

The matter of education appears to betone
which is rigidly confined to the little World of His-
tory 71 or English 22. There is precious little carry-
over of subject matter to the Tuck Shop or the
Student Union lounge. —

The single classroom subject which draws gen-
eral attention is grades! Only the possession of sat-
isfactory literal symbols is worth debating and
thinking about. Few pursue the. issues of history
or mathematics over coffee cups; the conﬂict of
ideas is waged only in the classroom where it sup-
posedly counts.

“Free time” away from the searching profes-
sorial question is devoted to more important,
worldly matters. But I seriously question if there
are more important or fundamental topics than
those presented in class. - T
Exchange Imporioni _

An integral part of education is the exchange
of student opinion and attitudes on academic mat-
ters. When this exchange is as minimal as it ap-
pears to be here, something is lacking, either in
the student body, in the teaching‘ leadership, or in
both. i

The general lack of concern and interest in
scholarly pursuits is a seriousnproblem. Local stu-
dents have taken the Greek proverbof “Nothing
too much,”, too literallyl am afraid. There is a
dangerous tendency to slide through four years of
college, acquiring‘ only it the thinnest veneer of edu-
cation.

Liberal education requires a whole—hearted ef-

’ fort by the student. Any compromising of “the‘in-’-

tellectual and moral integrity” of which Dr. Gris-
wold speaks can be lethal to the student.

Bowing to the notorious “cult of mediocrity”
in education brings disaster to all concerned-»with
learning in its ﬁnest sense..

‘us for complete living is the function which

Curriculum Rigid

Se_cond only to the threat of scholastic en-
cephalitis is the problem of curriculum rigidity.
There is too little freedom for individual initia-
tive in the present course system. \.

Standard pre—1'equisite requirements pertain in
areas where they are unnecessary. For example,
why cannotsophomores take courses numbered.
over 100? Do second—year
need to be spoon—l'ed? V

Dr. Charles Peake, assistant chancellor for stu-
dent affairs, has stated that he favors academic
flexibility to meet individual needs. Implementation
of the plan may be some distance away, though.

The honors seminar has been established as a -

means for capable students to pursue advzn-ifféd
work. Not enough individuals, however, are tak-
ing advantage of the..program to develop it fully.
This points up a third stumbling block in the path
of academic excellence.

.. A shortage of iiidividnalism is evident. The na-
tional swamp of conformity has oozed onto the
local campus. Although education is a personal
effort, few men seem willing to strike out on
their own, in search oftruth.

S Conditions Favor Dullness

While certain social conditions and organiza-
tions favor easy conformity or dullness the real
blame does not reside with them. It is the indi-
vidual renunciation of responsibility for learning
which causes intellectual stagnation.

The lack of thinking breeds conformity. Unless
there is a new emphasis placed on individuality
and a greater incentive provided to pursue learn-
ing. independently, the unfortunate conditions iﬁfll
persist. '~

The solutions to these three educational prob-
lems of scholastic apathy, academic inﬂexibility,
and student conformity won’t be found instantly.
The answers will only be obtained through careful
evaluation and criticism.

As a beginning, here‘are several possible ave-
nues of, consideration: enlargement of inter—de-
partmental majors programs, overhal of the core
curriculum concept, review of General Education
courses, provision for more -and earlier program
advising, development of the ﬁve-year engineering
program to include ‘more students.

Signiﬁcantly, the trimester proposal stands, as
the most important single factor in /the current’
academic. scene. Careful considerationiof the plan
by students and faculty is a necessity. ,,

Most students, however, seem more than will-
ing to let the faculty alone weigh the proposal.
The undergraduate liberal arts program will surely
rise or fall with the bold new plan; unfortunately,
only a minority of students seem to care.

If the proposal is adopted and then ﬂounders,
the undergraduates will have themselves to blame
for a lack of mentality, today. i

Herbert Spenser once commented, “To prepare
edu-

-¢_

cation*has to discharge.” ,
If the local University student believes in the
value of a full, meaningful life, he will begin‘ to
address himself to the current academicproblcms
and become involved in his own education. If he
deliberately rejects Spenser’s deﬁnition in favor or
a lesser one, so be it. -V

 

college students still,

might result.

Another point of the commit-
tee is thatgthe quarter system"
would only increase the

“through-put” by 331/3% and the ,

summer program by even less.

Through-put Unacademic

Through-put * is a new un-
academic— educational term in-
dicating the "number of students
who can be put through an in-
stitution of higher learni_ng.

The trimester calendar com-
mittee -‘believes sabbatical leaves
would take care of v professors
contemplating teaching else-
where for a semester, but it is
questionable to the faculty how
many leaves of this type would
be offered.

The faculty does like the very
impersonal attitude of corporate
“management which some believe
the “new dimension in learning”
is taking. Perhaps the view of a
speaker at the recent meeting of
the American College Public Re-
lations Association is closest to
the present faculty outlook.

The speaker said, as reported
in the Pittsburgh Press: “We
have shared with industry the

gloriﬁcationjof the‘. executive and’

organization man and ‘thus have
introduced into the educational

system the values of the market
place.
Purpose Stated
“The plain truth of the matter
is that administration exists for

the purpose of allowing the
really important people —— the;
O a faculty members and students 

to get their work done.”
“The success of any admini-
stration’ he concluded, ‘lies in

_ the degree to which it inconspic-
uously provides the environment,
4 and facilities within which in-

struction and research can effec-
tively be carried on.” V
The Pitt News has stated edi-

duced to the plan.y

torially that the trimester plan
should be tried in View of the
coming difficulties faced by uni-.
versities everywhere.  might,
however, serve ,a good- purpose to
have a‘ secret-ballot onithe pro-

, gram some time at the beginning
"of the second semester after

everyone has been fully intro-

Such a vote ‘might be taken
with the understanding that the
administration would ‘not be
bound by it and would determine
just what the support "of the pro-

ulty. , . - -<

The .oft—quoted truism‘ that
“Everybody talks about the

about it,” is no
longer applicable to the griev-
ance situation at Pitt.

Student ‘Congress has “taken
the bull by the horns” by organ-

Tangible evidence of this,com— .

mittee’s work is the Pitt Peeve

their peeves to be processed by the
committee.
Seeks To Solve Problems

Headed by Betty Chiappetta, Ed.
’58, the committee strives to learn
the problems of the student body,
to stimulate actionion these prob-
lems by the proper authorities,
and to see that this action is car-
ried out. to satisfaction.

Students are responding well.
The mailbox, which. is emptied
twice a week yields 40 to 50
gripes a week. Although the
mailbox is its chief means of
learning the problems, the com-
mittee also depends on personal
contacts. .

marked Betty,” and I feel that
they have done a terrifﬁc job with
the problems they have tackled.

The mailbox revealed many

in the Commons Room and
Smokers. The problem was
brought to the attention of the
Physical Plant which is now ex-
perimenting on ways to improve
lighting without spoiling the de-
sired effect of the Commons
Room.

The need for more water foun-
tains and the comment that “all
you need is a teabag to make tea
at some of the fountains” spurred
the committee into action. Physi-

Pegues, Hennon Star

But the steadiness of Hennon
and the ever-resourceful Jules
Pegues began to tell at the ten-
minute mark. Hennon potted a
couple of long ones; Pegues slow-
ed the action down; and the locals
were home free—Soffa notwith-
standing. .

Although the game was not
in doubt after this point, the
Panthers displayed the kind of
lackadaisical play that has sour-
ed the fans toward them.

The halftime count was 54-44,
the widest margin the Skyscraper-
men enjoyed in the ﬁrst twenty
minutes. Hennon ﬂicked in three
ﬁelders early in the second stanza
to widen the gap. The Tartans at-
tempted to ﬁght back,1but it was
too little, too late. The Panthers
were content to practice ball con-
trol and to allow Hennon to add
to his scoring total.

Nittany, Lions Next

The Wampum dead-eye had 15
.field ‘goals and four fouls for his
34 points. Pegues was next high
scorer with 11, all garnered in the
ﬁrst half. Hennon now has 338'

_ points for an average of 26 points

per game. The total places him as
the fourth highest scorer in the
nation.

The win was the Panthers’
eighth in thirteen games, and
the third in six away games.

Bressanelli received Honorable
on the All—American
team as a junior to be the first
Panther to ever receive such an
award. ’

Leo Bemis, coach of the Panther

deserving of the honor. “Jerry

No Slouch

On Or Off The Boards

By JANICE KLEIN

Today, anyone who knows that basketball is an indoor
sport using ﬁve men, a round ball and two baskets, knows

the name Don Hennon.

To date two national magazineshave done feature ar-
ticles on him, and several others have mentioned him for
outstanding work. Anyone who has seen Hennon in action

can easily understand the num-6

erous publicity releases. Although
chunky young man from
Wampum, Pa., is only a junior, he
holds ﬁve’ basketball records.

He broke three records when
he scored 45 points against Duke
-—Ed Pavlik’s one game record of
40 points and Robin Freeman’s
Field House record of 42. He eras-
ed his own previous mark for ﬁeld
goals by hitting 20 in one game.
Don also holds the record for fouls
in one game--16, and field goals
in one season-225.

Father Is Tutor ‘A

Breaking records is not new
for Hennon. While playing high-
school ball at Wampum, he estab-

Inghis senior year he helped his

Championship.

His father, who has trained
Don since third grade, is the
coach and principal at Wampum
High where Hennon starred.
Butler Hennon has a few rec-
ords he can be proud of himself.
For the past eight years his
team has captured its sectional

Wampum’s won and lost record
during the past three years is 113-
3. In a recent issue, Life Maga-
zine devoted several pages to the
man who helped “Wampum
Swamp ’EM.”_

Pre-Med Major

To add anything more about
Hennon’s prowess on the hard-
woods would be adding fuel to an
already blazing ﬁre. Anyone in-
terested in more statistics needs
only to pick up any paper or mag-
azine that has a sports section.

Off the basketball ﬂoor the
good-natured star leads the life
of any college man. Don’s stocky
frame can be seen most of the
time in Alumni Hall, for he is
a chemistry major. When he
graduates he intends to go on to
medical school. With grades just
a shade under three point, he
should have no difficulty.

Although practice and studying
leave little free time, Don did
manage to be a freshman coun-
selor and join Sigma Chi frater-
nity. In the summer he worked in
a mill to keep in shape. When he
has time to enjoy other sports,
Don likes to play baseball and
swim.

On weekends Hennon’s car can
be seen most often parked in front
of a nearby nurse’s residence.
When he goes out he enjoys danc-
ing, and a good movie. Nothing

steak, “the bigger the better!”

In spite of criticisms of the
team, Don feels, “he is playing
with a good group of men. They
employ team work and take ad-
vantage of all their shots.”

Fins Extend Practice Sessions
In Preparation For Lehigh Tilt

During the semester break, Coach Ben Grady’s tankers
have two meets scheduled.iThe first meet is with Lehigh at
the Carnegie Tech Pool on February 1 at 2:00 pm. Lehigh
had a 7-3 record last season and is rated a slight favorite

On February 8, the team will travel to West Point to
meet the Black Knights of the0*

of 41:15.2 set in 1957. The new rec-

ord was set by Willis Weisz,

Charles Nanz, Eugene Adams, and

Ken Cooper.

Coach Grady, a little disap-
pointed in the poor showing of the
team against the Sophomore
studded Ohio University’s swim-
ming team, expects the Locals "to
put in a little overtime at their
practice sessions.

“VVe have a good many boys
on the squad that have a lot of
potential but still have not
shown it in-dual meet competi-
tion,” commented Gra-dy..

He also added,
this potential is the coordinated
effort of the relay team to set a
new school record over the 400
yard event. A little more improve-
ment and I think that we should
provide some top competition for
the remainder of “our rugged
schedule.”

 Peer Shuns Politics For Journalism;

, Covers Soviet Revolution Celebration ,

By NATHAN MARYN
Lord Kilbracken, British free-lance journalist is the guest

Union this week.

of Dr. Robert Newman, director of the William Pitt'Debating

Lord Kilbracken is at the University as a part of his cur-
rent lecture tour of the United States which included an ap-
pearance today at the Midday Series Program.

He has recently returned from%

Russia where he covered the For-
tieth Anniversary Celebration of
the Russian Revolution for the
London Daily Express. He told
about his experiences behind the

‘ Iron Curtain today.

Uninterested in Politics
Born John Godly, he was ele-
vated to the peerage in 1950 after
the death of his father. In his

seven years as a British Lord, he
.has rarely sat in the House of
Lords. ‘ ' '

He believes- that, although he
has a right to participate in legis-
lation for Great Britain, politics

should be left to those who are

politically inclined and those who
are the elected representatives of
the people.’

He began his journalistic"
career as a staﬂ reporter on a
London daily’ paper. He soon

 found that he much preferred

to write about things that par-
ticularlyrinterested him, and he
took to free-lance feature writ-
ing. Since then he has contrib-
uted to the NEW YORKER,
VOGUE, and many newspapers.
During World War II he spent
ﬁve days in Murmansk and has

since wanted to go to Russia to
-visit and sightsee. He had tried

several years ago to get a visa to
go to Russia but never succeeded.
—Whilé in France in the fall of
1957 he decided that he would

' likerto do a series of stories on

the Russian Revolution Celebra-
tion and telephoned his propo-
sal to the DAILY EXPRESS
which accepted it.

He got his visa in nine days

‘that time. Once in Russia he de-

cided that he would cover the big
parade from the ground as a

imarcher. He marched with the

workers, collective farmers, and
students and was recognized as an
outsider only twice.

Lord Kilbracken phoned his re-

’, ports of the celebration, through

Soviet censorship, to London
daily. Though his assignment for
the Express is over, he is still
writing about it. He has written
an article based on his experiences

for Vogue magazine,, and it will
~ appear in the March issue.

While he tours the United
States, Lord Kilbracken is busy

R trying to ﬁnish his latest book “A
‘ Peer Behind the Curtain.” which

will ‘be released in the Fall. After
the book is completed in March,

(Continued from Page 1)

Norma Sfara, Col. ’60, says it’s
the answer to getting a master’s
degree more quickly. T

Nancy Bush, N.’6l, likes the
idea but wonders how it will affect
student teaching, the nursing plan,
etc.

Virginia Pollak, N.’59, says “It’s‘
good for older students like vet-
erans. The details can be ironed
out when the plan is in effect.”

Marcia Getting, Col.’59, “I don’t
think it’s consistent with Dr.
Litchﬁeld’s inaugural address in
which he stated that the Uni-
versity’s ﬁrst responsibility is to
its students. This plan would not.
be conducive to educating the
total person.” , ,

Judy Bancroft, N.’61, “I feel
that this plan is basically good,
provided that the graduates are
mature enough to go into the work
world at this age.” .

Judy Myers, Col.’61, For those
who feel themselves capable of
handling the strain of continuous
academic work, I believe this plan
is ideal, especially when they are
anxious to get started in their
chosen ﬁelds.” ,

John Kuprock‘, C0l.’6l, is afraid

that “trimesters will affect the
athletic program and practice
times.”

Matt Crofton, Col.’61, who op-«‘
posed the plan during the previous
poll reversed his opinion because
it is not mandatory that a student

-attend for three consecutive tri-

mesters.

Howard Rossen, Co1.’58, favors
getting a degree in three years
and going on to professional school
as quickly as possible.

V“ Did your polio shot
  hurt, Jackie?”

What is pain? Is’ it the quick prick of a needle . . . or the slow
breaking of a heart? _ —

If you’ve ever seen a child . . . or a mother or a father . . .
for whom the.Salk vaccine came too late, then you know true
pain. Because you know how it feels to have your heart torn,
piece by piece, from your body.

Imagine, then, how you’d feel if you were to see—or be--a. ,
polio victim who could have had the Salk vaccine...and didn't.

It’s almost unbelievable that this could happen . . . yet last
summer’s statistics show that perhaps it already has . . .

In 1956, polio cases were reported down 47% from 1955 . . .
and down 59% from the ﬁve-year average for 1951-1955. And
' cases dropped mostyslzarply in the group which had received

the most vaccine. This was the group of children, 5-9 years of

age, ﬁrst allowed to have the limited vaccine. But, tragically .
enough, not all these eligible children were permitted by their‘ "
parents to have the vaccine.

Can we afford to let another polio season go by without
giving our children-and ourselves-the protection of the Salk 
vaccine? For, bad as it is to see a little one struck down by
this disease, itis just as heartbreaking to see a mother taken
from her family by polio . . . or a father left helpless and un-
able to provide for his family. J

Polio, it must be remembered, is not exclusively a chil-
dren's disease. Although it strikes more often in the lower
age groups, it hits hardest among young adults. That’s why
everyone under 40 yearsof age‘ should be vaccinated.

So get your shots now-—today-and take the whole family
with you. ' -

No, youxxpolio shots won’t hurt—-compared to how your
heart will ache if you neglect to have your family vaccinated
. . . and then..polio strikes. ’

s

DON'T PRESS YOUR LUCK. It takes 8 months and  in- 

iecfions for maximum polio protection.‘ START YOUR
SHOTS NOW. And protect the whole family.
