First ever baboon to human liver transplant performed at Presby

By Pete Kapustynski
Staff Writer

The first baboon—to-human liver
transplant was performed at Presbyterian
University Hospital under the supervision
of transplant pioneer Thomas Starzl late
Sunday morning. .

According to Starzl, a baboon liver was
chosen for the 55-year-old male patient
because the donor liver is resistant to the
hepatitis B infection from which the
patient is suffering. Without the transplant,
the patient’s liver would have eventually

been destroyed by hepatitis, Starzl
said.

“Baboons cannot be infected with
hepatitis B, so as a source of_ organs
they may offer‘ a solution for these
patients [and] a chance to live,” Starzl
said.

Starzl said the baboon was also
chosen because it can be easily bred in
captivity and is not an endangered
animal.

But the surgery drew criticism from
People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals. The group staged a small protest

outside of the hospital Tuesday.

PETA Education Director Sue Brebner
said, “We question whether animals exist
for human beings to exploit. We don’t
question any of [Starzl’sl procedures or
methods. We are against the operation
from an ethical standpoint. We believe
there was a problem with the informed-
consent issue in this case. I wonder if it
was fully explained how risky it is to use
animal tissue.”

Brebner said doctors should not have
had to resort to this type of last-rninute
operation. “Hepatitis B is a preventable

illness. We don’t blame the patient for his
decision. We place the blame for this on
the medical system that victimized this
man,” she said.

According to Starzl, such transplantation
could revolutionize health care.
“[Transplantation] with organs from
baboons or other animals could offer a
predictable, ready supply of organs. This
would, in turn, result in fewer patients
dying while waiting and allow us to
operate on an elective basis before patients
are literally at death's door,” Starzl
said.

Yea/eel calls
for improved

health care
for women

By Jim Lakely
Sports Editor

Democratic U.S. Senate
candidate Lynn Yeakel spoke to
an enthusiastic crowd of
supporters about gay and lesbian
issues at a Pride Week reception
at the Pittsburgh Athletic Club
Wednesday night. .

The fund—raiser was sponsored
by TRI—PAC, an independent
political action committee
dedicated to the political agenda
of the gay, lesbian and bisexual
community. V

Yeakel voiced her views on a
variety of issues concerning gay,
lesbian, bisexual and women’s
groups. _

“The problems of AIDS and
women’s health issues are of
great concern to me,” Yeakel
said. “We must expand the
treatment and prevention
programs for AIDS victims, but
at this point the government is
cutting back support’ for these
programs.

“I believe we must have earlier
diagnoses for women because
women die, on average, 10
months after diagnosis as
compared to two years for men,
and that is due to the lack of
diagnostic research and the lack
of sensitivity and attention to this
problem,” she said. “We must
turn that around and’. make
treatment and diagnostic
programs for AIDS victims a

priority.”

PA abortion
law upheld
by Court

By Jason Hillman
‘Managing Editor

In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme
Court ruled Monday that
Pennsylvania state restrictions on
abortion are legal, but it did not

Wade.

In Planned Parenthood v.
Casey, the court upheld four
sections of the Pennsylvania
Abortion Control Act:

-requiring a 24-hour waiting
period before a woman can have
an abortion, after listening to a
presentation intended to make
her change her mind

orequiring teenagers to have
the consent of one parent or a
judge

0specifying the medical
emergency in which the above
requirements can be waived

orequiring the doctor or clinic
to make statistical reports to the
state. The court struck down
the section requiring spousal
notification.

Both’ sides of the abortion
debate c_ritici2ed the decision.

“I think it’s a very confusing
decision to most people,” said
Carol Pencke, chairperson of the
national board of the National
Abortion Rights Action League.
“Unfortunately, it doesn’t do what
it says it does. It says that it
upholds Roe, but in fact, by
upholding parental notification,
by upholding the 24-hour waiting
period and by upholding the so-
called “informed consent,” that
we consider propaganda, it

 

use the case to overturn Roe v.’

Yeakel said the Supreme Court
ruling on RAV v. St. Paul, in
which the court ruled that adding
additional punishment for those
found guilty of hate crimes is
unconstitutional, has “very
troubling implications for us all.

“I am afraid that the decision
will chill the positive efforts of
state and local governments

crimes,” she said. ‘‘I think that

Over 1,000 march for gay pride

Pittsburgh City Council

Pittsburgh was beginning to

He was referring to a crowd
of over_,1,000 which had
marched from the Civic Arena

“I’d [like to] ask you to

There were two reasons he
asked the crowd to do this.
“First of all, come election

Students and faculty at Taylor

to an article printed in Monday's

In the article, students reported

The group is also collecting the
signatures of legislators and
congressional candidates on a
document which ensures their
promises to vote for more funding

According to a prepared
statement by CAH, it will take
$14 billion to fully fund the
existing programs, a sum which
is less than 1 percent of the U.S.
budget.

Teachers at the school reported
that students’ grades were
changed without suitable cause
and without the teachers’
notification.

The article also reviewed the

students reported that cheating

the proctor on the Scholastic

Rubenstein to head Pitt BOT

By Megan Bertino
Editor in Chief

Farrell Rubenstein has been
chosen as the new chairperson
of Pitt’s Board of Trustees.

During his tenure on the board,
Rubenstein chaired the
committee that selected Pitt
Chancellor ].Dennis O’Connor
and the committee that
restructured the board’s bylaws.

Rubenstein replaces John
Marous, who received criticism
last fall when it was discovered
that he had signed documents
giving former Pitt President
Wesley Posvar’s a $5 million
retirement package.

Despite requests for his
resignation from groups on
campus, Marous held his post
but is now required to step down
under the new bylaws. These

state the chair of the board may '

Pride

not serve more than five
consecutive one-year terms.

Marous told the board, “I
believe the time has come for my
retirement as chairman of the
Board of T rustees. I am deeply
grateful to all of you for your
total support during my term. I
shall never forget it.”

Members of the board gave

Marous a standing ovation as he
stepped down and a second
ovation when O’Connor named
him a charter trustee.
’ In other elections Robert
Dunkelman will replace Lewis
Popper as the board’s secretary,
and Mary Lou Rosborough was
elected to a newly created
position of associate secretary of
the board.

Rosborough’s duties will
include assisting the secretary
and, serving as a liaison between
trustees and ' university

administrators.

In other business, O’Connor
announced a partial
reorganization of the university
at the administrative level.

Vice Chancellor of the Health
Sciences and Executive Vice
President of the Medical Center
Jeffrey Romoff was named senior
vice chancellor for health
administration and president of
the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center.

Thomas Detre, who is currently
recovering from heart surgery,
will remain senior vice chancellor
for the health sciences.

Lawrence Weber, vice
chancellor of alumni relations,
will head the Department of

. Development and Alumni

Relations and the Department of
University Relations, which have
been renamed the Office of
Institutional Advancement.

march on Washington this spring.

“It’s about time that we begin
to hold our elected officials, in
the highest offices of this country,
accountable,” Ferlo said.

“We have a fight there, with
respect to having the Congress
make the armed services stop its
bigotry, and the biggest fight of
all, for all of you and all of
everyone in our society, is support
for research and care for people
who suffer from HIV and AIDS,”
said Carnegie Mellon Professo
Tom Kerr. , ‘ A

Other speakers included
members of social and support
groups in the gay community.

‘ Kevin Moore of Growing
Alternative Youth said, “I did a
little bit of research earlier in the
week. I found out that the city of
Pittsburgh has approximately
569,000 people in it.

“Approximately 9 percent of
that population is between the
ages of 12 and 20. That works out

   

to be about 35,000. If you go by
the national 10-percent figure,
there’s about 5,000 gay and
lesbian and bisexual teenagers
in the city of Pittsburgh.

“Now I know that might not be
a very comfortable fact for a lot
of people in the straight world to
accept, because they don’t like
to think that teenagers can even
be gay. But I know that a lot of
the people here today probably
at one point in time or another
were a gay, lesbian or bisexual
youth.”

“So I would like to pose the
question of, where are these 3,000
youth? Are they in clandestine
meeting places, or did they go to
the cruising zones that they see
on the news? Or are they isolated
and alone, frustrated and scared?
Well, this is what Growing
Alternative Youth is for."

Bonnie Larson of Parents and
Friends of Lesbians and Gays
said, “When I found out my son
was gay, I tried to talk to other

parents about it, but I couldn’t
locate any. So, I helped start a
group with three or four other
couples. Now we have 15 to 23
helping out. We’re one of 280
chapters nationwide.”

Other speakers included
members of Pitt's Bisexual Gay,
and Lesbian Alliance and the
Gay/Lesbian/ Bisexual Veterans
Association. Pittsburgh Queer
Theatre performed the song
“12 Days Home For Christ-

7!

H138.

John Curlovich, a member of
the Pride Committee that
organized the parade and rally,
read a letter from the mayor’s
ofﬁce.

The letter proclaimed June
27, 1992 Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Pride Day in the city of
Pittsburgh.

Holding the letter up to the
crowd, Curlovich said, “You can
see it’s on frightfully tasteful wine-
colored vellum. I think that alone
is a marvelous gesture.”

PARC competes in
national Field Day

By Jason Hillxnan
Managing Editor

The University of Pittsburgh’s Panther Amateur Radio Club
operated an emergency radio station for 24 hours Saturday and
Sunday, using only solar-powered batteries and a gasoline-
powered generator for a nationwide Field Day for ham radio
operators.

The goal of the competition is to contact as many other
amateur ham radio operators as possible without using any
permanently installed equipment or contacting any station
twice.

“We have a station running under less than optimal conditions,”
T om Link, president of PARC, said. “Homemade antennae
thrown up here, nothing permanent, generators, solar panels
which we may use in an actual disaster.” -

The Field Day was sponsored by the American Radio Relay
League, a nationwide organization of ham radio operators. This
was the third year PARC participated in the event.

in Washington over the past 12 years, where the power has been
concentrated and consolidated at the top of the government, has
fostered a society of intolerance, greedfracism and of hate crimes,
and we cannot allow these things to ﬂourish in our society,” Yeakel
said.

Yeakel said she is convinced that Americans will have to fight for
privacy and civil rights through congressional legislators.

She also blamed the stagnant economy and many of the ills of
society on the political machine of the past 12 years.

“I believe that it is the role of the federal government to lead that
way in turning the economy around,” Yeakel said. “By all measures,
things are worse in this state after 12 years of Ronald Reagan, George
Bush and Arlen .Specter. T ' . I

“That is one reason why I believe that this election is critically

important in American history: because the courts that have been i 

appointed by Reagan, Bush and Specter are not going to protect our
rights; they are not going. to protect our privacy, and they are not
going to‘ "be A places that-we can turn, for the protection of our civil
rights. , . 9 = - -  -. _f‘,.; -

back control of this government and put people in who will stand
up and ﬁght for the rights of all of us. and ﬁght for a just and humane
society," she said. gr     i T -

Yeakel said she would support a; national health-care bill and
would like to make education her aNO._ 1 priority. She believes in
renewing the relationship between the federal government and the
voters of this country. ; ,; ' ~

“My philosophy is that if people are given the tools that they need
to succeed, then they will take control of their own lives and become
part of the solution,” Yeakel said. 

“I believe that there is a proper‘, role for the government: [to
reinvest] in the people of this country, to put people on the top of
the agenda, to invest in our education system and make sure that
education is the No. 1 national priority.”

last night.

Continued from page 1
considering the fundamental
constitutional questions resolved
by Roe, principles of institutional
integrity  we are led to conclude
this: the essential holding of ‘Roe
v. Wade should be retained and
once again conﬁrmed.”

The court opinion, while
upholding Roe, gave states a
framework to have more control

the unborn are permitted, if they

are not a substantial obstacle to .

the woman’s exercise of the right
to choose.” -

The majority opinion was
supported in part by Justices
Harry A. Blackmun and John
Paul Stevens, who each wrote a
separate opinion.

Blackmun, who; wrote the
majority opinion in Roe, said, “I
do not underestimate the
significance of »today’s joint
opinion. Yeti remain steadfast in
my belief that the right to
reproductive choice is entitled to
the full protection afforded by
this court  I fear for the darkness
as four justices anxiously await
the single vote necessary to
extinguish the light.”

The dissenting opinion, led by
separate opinions by Chiefjustice
William H. Rehnquist and Justice
Antonin Scalia, agreed with the
upholding of the Pennsylvania
restrictions but looked to overturn
Roe entirely.

“We believe that Roe was
wrongly decided, and it can and
should be overruled ...” Rehnquist
wrote.

“The states may, if they wish,
permit abortion on demand, but
the Constitution does not require
them to do so,” Scalia said. i

Commentary on the decision
came strongly and swiftly from
both sides.

country sharply away from
abortion on demand . . . [It]
clearly returns to the people the
power to regulate abortion in a
reasonable way so as to protect
maternal health and reduce the
number of abortions,” said Gov.
Robert Casey, according to the
Pz'ttsbu'rgbPost—GazetteNewsFax.

“This is a victory for the child
in the womb,” said Pittsburgh
Bishop Donald W. Wuerl.

The abortion-rights movement
quickly mobilized after the
decision, holding two press
conferences on the day _of the
decision, one in the alley behind
the YWCA downtown.

“With its decision to uphold
Pennsylvania’s restrictive
abortion law, the U.S. Supreme
Court is no longer chipping away
at Roe v. Wade,” said Kimberlee
S. Evert, president of Planned
Parenthood of Western
Pennsylvania. “It has used a
wrecking ball to batter the
foundation of that landmark
decision.”

to dangerous restrictions on a

leads to the back alleys of
America.”

Pencke said NARAL’s plans
have not changed with the court’s
decision. NARAL’s first goal is to
defeat George Bush in the
presidential elections. “We need
to be sure that in November we
have a pro-choice president,” she
said.

NARAL’s second goal is to work
toward the passage of the
Freedom of Choice Act this
summer. But Pencke said NARAL
is not sure if there are enough
votes to overturn the expected
presidential veto.

-U.S. Senate candidate Lynn

condemning the Court ruling._ “I
am opposed to government
interference in this personal,
private family decision. I believe
stronglythat women have a
fundamental right to privacy and

decision ‘undercuts that right,”
Yeakel said. A

Justice injustice

In Pennsylvania, doctors must show pictures of fetuses to
women who want abortions, thanks to Monday’s Supreme
Court ruling. Patients must then wait 24 hours after seeing
the fetuses to schedule an abortion. No precedent exists for
these restrictions in other medical procedures. Showing
photos of fetuses smacks of pushing a moral agenda into
law.

Women who have hysterectornies are not required to
view movies of women suffering from hot ﬂashes. Abortion
patients are singled out to scare and intimidate into choosing
another option.

Though these restrictions become law 30 days from now,
no provisions have been made for the consequences of
restricting abortion availability. The women most affected
will be‘ those with little representation: teen-agers and poor
women.

The 24-hour waiting period forces women to take two
days off work, a hardship for women in low-paying jobs.
The restriction requiring doctors to meet twice with patients
will increase abortion costs. The information given at this
first meeting is already given to women (minus the bloody
fetus pictures) by counselors at women’s clinics. This is a
tactic to decrease the number of women who can afford to
have abortions. .

When federal funding of abortions ended, many women

. were unable to have abortions. They were forced to keep

children they did not want and could not afford to support:
Adoption is a fantasy of middle—class prolife groups, most
of which would not adopt the children of pregnant black
teen-agers. Yet they want to set policies which ruin the lives
of these children.

Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s “undue burden” test will
allow courts to assess whether each new restriction places
difficult obstacles before women who want abortions. This
test was stated so vaguely that it gives states loopholes to
pass even more stringent restrictions on abortion. .

Another restriction accepted by the court is that doctors
must submit abortion medical records to the state. These
medical records may become public records. This is a
dangerous precedent. This violates a patient’s right to
privacy. Any pro-life activist could obtain the information
and harass women who have had abortions as they are now
harassing doctors who perform abortions.

In attempting to reach middle ground by not overturning
Roe v. Wade and by allowing most of the restrictions, the
court has managed to anger activists on both sides of the
abortion issue. Several jurists admitted that though they
personally disagreed with Roe U. Wade, they chose to follow
constitutional law and uphold it. While it is admirable that

' they were able to see a larger picture, they still left the

resolution of this issue no clearer. They should have struck
down all of the restrictions because none of them were
viable.States have received the message that if they have a
compelling interest in protecting the rights of fetuses over
those of women, they can severely restrict abortion.

» The true villain in this ruling is Governor Robert Casey,
who pushed for these restrictions. As signs attached to
ominous coat hangers all over Oakland read “You have a
tyrant -running Pennsylvania,” a message to poor women
and teen-agers can also be added —— “You now have fewer
choices in Pennsylvania.”

Race relations skewed by media

As I watched the coverage of
the riots in Los Angeles, I was
forcibly struck by the fact that the
media are not the impartial,
unbiased social institutions that
they portray themselves to be.
Rather, they have a political
agenda of their own, and
everything they say should be
taken with this in mind.

Rich men control the oil

industry, the auto makers,
electronics — EVERYTHING.
What is forgotten is that the media
(CNN, ABC, The New Yorle Times,
The Washington Post, Time,
Newsweek, etc.) are businesses.
They are large corporations with
large amounts of money. Rich
men control them, just as they
control big business and the
government. The primary
difference occurs along political
lines. The media tend to sit left of
the political—ideological fence.
Their success comes from playing
against the power holders on the
right side of that fence. This
provides the media’s “liberal”
description, and they serve as a
“fourth branch of government,”
one devoted to the spread of
information. .

Yes, they do expose corruption
in society, and this is a valuable
service. However, society trusts
them to be impartial. With very
few restrictions, they can say what
they want. This gives them an
incredible amount of power to
affect any issue by merely altering
the way they portray it. In turn,
they can slant issues to suit their
liking. Very rarely are they
questioned about their reporting,
and if they are, they are the ones
to report the existence of these
questions.

In this country, the voices of
social, economic or racial
minorities can be very dangerous
to the stability of the power
structure. The men who control
mass media in this country are
firmly entrenched in their own
section of that structure, and they
can be threatened by these
minority voices. To safeguard any
type of power, certain steps must
be taken, and the media are able

to help. One useful process is by
choosing how the issue is
represented. The media can
determine how outsiders will view
an issue. They can also change
the manner in which those inside
the issue view it. '

When the media cover social
injustice, they do so with the
intent of protecting themselves if
necessary. This protection also
extends to protecting the people

David
  Winters

involved in the press, especially
the controlling upper echelon.
The most widely used tactic for
this purpose is also the simplest
to implementzl divide and
conquer.

In the media coverage I saw
and heard while growing up, the
message was frightening. I grew
up being told, in effect, that racial
inequality was necessary to
protect white people. The
underlying theme was that blacks
don't want equality, they want
revenge; they want to invert the
social structure and harm whites
for a few hundred ‘years.’ in

Hearing this, my reaction was
natural; “Socially, if I’m going to
be either up or down, I'm going
to make sure that I’m on the up
side.” Well, there were the
makings of a potential racist. All
it took was my television. This is
a personal example of a process
which has the effect of dividing
the people of this country along
raciallines. Race is convenient-
it is an easy difference to call
attention to because it is visually
apparent.

It is also necessary, from the
power block's point of view, to
keep minority groups at each
others’ throats. In the riots, media
played upon the rift between the
black and Korean communities.

There are genuine reasons for
the rift between these two groups,
but the media acted to widen and

._distort the gap instead of to

explain or bridge it. The Korean
shop owners’ actions were
distorted — rather than ‘being
reported as protecting their
property, they were branded
“vigilantes.”

This is a beautiful example, as
this misrepresentation allows the
media’ to further their policies
with one action. They directly
divide two minority groups and

also seed dissention among racial”

lines. This decreases the common
people’s ability to endanger the
elite’s ideas of itself and its role in
society.

- The media also make use of an
existing social norm which states
that if something is neither heard
nor talked about, then it has no
importance (and vice versa). Such
is the case with minorities in
America.

For example, black voices have
never been considered important
in this country; to reinforce this,
blacks simply don't appear on
the news with any regularity. I
can remember» few instances of
black opinions being sought
during newscasts.

However, during the L.A. riots
every news program and network
was full of black opinions.
Because of the original focus of
the riots, understanding black
opinions was necessary to
understand the upheaval.
Basically, at that particular time it
was the “in” action for the news
media to take.

However, in the weeks since
the riots the black voice has
shrunken once again to its
previous level —— barely present.
This is because minority opinions
are once again being relegated to
obscurity until they have a direct
bearing on a “hot” news item.

When you examine media
coverage of the world, keep in
mind that the media are not
impartial. Take everything with a
grain of salt, and never forget to
think for yourself.

Showcase Editor

Nowhere is the gap between
independent and corporate rock
so striking as when one side
declares a superstar. Under
corporate schematics, the
affection is blatantly termed in
number of sales and image
in hopes of a prosperous
future. _

But for the self-governing
recording world, the distinction
and honor codes are anything
but blatant and almost always
pulselike: the idolization, the
result of luck and/or keen pop
sensibilities that attract a youthful
audience willing to search for
product.

Unlike the video-generated
singles of today, independent
labels rely on neither the visual

image nor the resulting hit—single

mentality to appeal to its
consumers.

As majors keep calling for the
alternative attraction (such as
Nirvana), the blame can’t always
be thrust upon the money-
mongers; rather, fault (if there
is such a thing in this case) must
go to the independent factions
which continue to funnel out
exciting and challenging new
sounds.

Most recent to ride the indie
rave is Pavement out of Stockton,
Calif., with more recent ties
landing it in New York City,
the hub of the urban alter-
naﬁve.

While their success has come
from an overload of press
pantings (including a poignant
piece in May in the New York
Times Sunday Arts And Leisure
by Jon Pareles, and coverage
in every local publication not
striking), this five—piece out-
fit seems to have no respect
or concern for the slob-
bering. .

_ The band openly refuses
interviews, scorns photos and
mocks everything that has to do
with a label's (in this case the
New York-based Matador)
attempt at band publicity. But all
of this has a distinct tongue—in-
cheek bulge that makes the band

. ‘Esra’ ~ ' -='

 

all the fuss about Pavement?  

all the more likable.

While Pavement may shun the
exterior spotlight of its new fame,
internally it adheres to one of
indie rock's finest attributes: self-
reﬂexivity.

On its first full-lengther, Slanted
And Enchanted, the band
addresses the horrors of success
on “Fame Throwa,” equating fame
with spies and recruits as if it was
intertwined with barbaric regime
qualities.

“In The Mouth A Desert" is a
gentle, sedate number that speaks
directly at Pavement’s lavish
praise with a haunting chorus:
“I've been crowned the king of
it,” then only to shift in the next
chorus to, “I've been down the
king of it.”

If its harsh portrayal of
ascendancy is a result of this
recording, the lyrics suggest that
the band knew stardom was
inevitable and decided to adhere
to fame’s unwritten rules
prematurely, blasting them in a
parodying style. ,

Live, as the band was two
weeks ago in the Pitt student
union, Pavement somewhat
smashed its enigmatic stance and
came out of the closet with a
performance that reeked of
swaggered boasting.

Thinking its image was an
apathetic anti—image, many
expected a quiet, mild-mannered,
low—key quintet who knew how
to rock.

Instead Pavement served up a
fresh attitude and appearance,
the band members joyfully
mocking each other and eliciting
crowd response — not the type

of antics usually associated with
indie rock stars.

Defying the distant and
mysterious in favor of fun and
games, courtesy of “hippie
drummer” Gary Young’s punch
drunk meanderings — falling
backwards over his rinky-
dink kit to emphasize a song’s
end and jousting with lead
singer SM with quibs like “I
don’t know how that one
goes” ———plodded the amusing
scenario and shattered an
image.

What was left was a group of

 

 

Spiral Stairs and hippie drummer Gary Young. King fame receivers?

jesters whose spirit seemed
thought-out and playful, going
against all grains of low—key
success in favor of the punchy,
happy feel that is oft reserved for
English crossover drifters or
corporate hairdos ‘without
anything else to say.

They may not care that they’re
stars, but they sure can act it —-
at least on stage.

Musically, there is no denying
that its sound has evolved from
minimal low-ﬁdelity recordings
(three seven-inch records and a
10-inch, which were all received
with newborn-like affection from
critics) to an open—ended

smashing rendition of a host of .

indie rock legends past and
present. ‘ "

The parallels are too similar to
ignore. Unlike Teenage Fanclub
(a former Matador label mate
which moved to the Geffen music
mogul), which mocks the sounds
of Big Star and others in obtrusive
representationalism, Pavement
excels by expanding another
band's sound and always
allowing a smile, while Fanclub
leaves a burnt, overworked
taste.

The big marching drum kick
and English-tainted vocals of
“Two States” are distinctly
reminiscent of The Fall, while
“Chelsey’s Little Scars” stinks of

\

the Pixies with its ragged frantic
groove.

There’s no use in pretending
that the sounds aren’t obvious
and identiﬁable, but what makes
Slantedso lovely is its chameleon
qualities.

Each listen is refreshing, taking
on a new psyche each time out:
one time lovely - and roman-
tic, the next fractured and
cynical.

While the press has labeled it
the best art band of the ’90s, the
categorization may be too

i limiting. .

What Pavement does isn’t
anything new,_ just exciting:
taking guitars —— they’re definitely
a guitar band — that lead, push
and soothe to the edge.As

‘Dinosaur Jr., used to do with

larger, more metallic leads
flowering them with melodic
accompaniments and harsh, yet
structured vocals, Pavement does
the same, only in a subtler -
way.

Listen to the driven “No Life
Had Signed Her” with its

wobbled harmonious vocal,

bouncy chorus and guitars that
blast off, then truck in and out of
rapid breaks, and you’ll hear the
analogous style that defines
Pavement’s existence.

The album’s seasonally
anthemic opener “Summer

. anxious

Babe” (with its tinged fuzz) is
the perfect summer accomp-
animent — its picturesque lyrics
with potentially
misguided summer love.and
boring hot days without it, or at

_ least the thought.

Even the backgrounded
instrumentations and vocals are
speciﬁcenough to place. The
exhilarating and perfect pop—pop
feel of “Perfum—V” and its reared,
sing—along style reek of late ’70s
English punk anthems, or try
“Trigger Cut” with its off—kilter
stagger and joyous “sha la la”
chants that drag the song back
and forth like two lumbermen
wielding a mammoth saw on a
fresh cut oak.

Despite the LP’s schizophrenic
makeup the work is as catchy as
a dog and his bone — from
the vocals, which are usually low
in the mix, to the grounded
rhythm guitars which stick out
all over the place, giving the
record its dominant coherent
touch. _

“(The ode to J.G-. Ballard)
Loretta’s Scar” and its heavenly
follow-along guitar riffs stays true
to the album’s more fragile
moments, while “Conduit For

Sale” leans more to the psychotic

makeup beside its brash recant

Thurston Moore drags out his buddies for Ecstatic Peace

Dim Stars
Dim Stars
Caroline Records

Way back in ’78 did Baby Thurston
Moore dream ripped-T fantasies about
staggering cross-stage with Richard Hell
 maybe spending his nights nested in
the parental warmth of Dick and Patty
Smyth’s dirty sheets? Thurston was patient
and dogged because everybody knows
that love comes in spurts. (Sometimes it
hurts.) Twelve years later Thurston is a
grandpa. Hundreds of rock ‘n’ roll
incarnations choked the trail that Sonic
Youth blazed, and he probably discovered
that he has‘ enough time -and cash to
screw around and realize some of those
old wet dreams. So Thurston started a
record label (Ecstatic Peace), made up a
few band names (mirror/ Dash, Dim Stars)

and advertised. Life is magic when you’ve
got that underground pull.

Meanwhile the memory of Dick Hell,
fading into 10 years of textbook, punk
rock obscurity, was only being kept alive
by the goateed younger siblings of real
punks dusting off the vinyl for still younger
versions of post—teenage angst ‘n’ apathy;
a third blank generation leaving it behind
for the most part.

When they let him out of the cellar to
record with Moore, Steve Shelley and
Gumballer Don Fleming, it was discovered
that coming off the needle transformed
Hell into the hydrocephalic twin of
professional wrestler Andre the Giant.
Really. There’s pictures to prove it.

So the four, collectively representing
two generations of lower East Side legends
and dangerously flirting with pre-historic
status, assumed the Moore—monikered role

of Dim Stars and did the only thing
potential rockosaurs do when they step
on the comeback trail. They recorded a
coupla punk-rock standards
(STANDARDS?!). Released along with the
cosmically bombastic “Dim Star Theme”
and the very first tune Hell ever penned,
the triple 7-inch set did minor damage
amongst those aforementioned second
and third generations. Swell enough for
Hell? Why not an album?_ Dim Stars’ Dim
Sta1s?Ahh yes.

One thing is clear. The smell of Hell is
all over Dim Stars. Without him it is just
another noodly, abem, boring side project
of the youngsters (like that stupid Ralee
record). Lyrical flow is inlthe back seat.
Priority goes to stuffing each lip—ﬂapping
syllable into each line singing the praises
of sad suicidal chicks and secret prayers to
urban dirt. One might get the feeling. that

Hell has been victimized by the female
form. In “All My Witches Come True” hear:
“I could hardly crawl with all the girls in
my head/They'd come alive and suck me

dry and leave me for dead.” It doesn’t stop .

there either. “Weird Forest” is a goofy
Dungeons and Dragons. nightmare
featuring mini-wimmin that wanna pee on
Dick’s head. Also, with Hell pushing 40,
there's a somewhat creepy" fear of the
years with the “night coming on” all the
time and stars being “dim and made of
lead” everywhere. And, after all, Hell just
wants to be loved, O.K?

Cerebral musing aside, Dim Stars
abounds with trademark Hell. The basic
tracks are kept low in the mix with an
occasional nifty lead by Voidoid axe and
Man-With-Finger—In-Every—Pot Robert
Quine. With Hell prioritized his friends

Verdict in: Lindros dealt to Flyers

By Rob Pugliese
Senior Staﬂ‘ Writer

The Eric Lindros affair is a done deal. Finally.

It looked as if hockey’s next franchise player
would never find a new home. Quebec traded
Lindros to two teams on the same day, breaking
new ground in ineptitude. Not just any two teams
either —. two bitter rivals.

Following a complex arbitration process, the 19-
year-old superstar has ofﬁcially become the property
of the Philadelphia Flyers in the biggest trade in
hockey history.

Larry Bertuzzi, a 44-year-old Toronto lawyer,
served as the independent arbitrator in settling a
dispute between the Flyers, the Nordiques and the
New York Rangers.

The arbitration hearing lasted five days and
required 11 witnesses who testified under
oath.

Now that the trade is complete, the Flyers will
send centers Mike Ricci and Peter Forsberg,
goaltender Ron Hextall, defensemen Steve
Duchesne and Kerry Huffman, along with their
1993 first-round draft choice and $15 million to
Quebec,

The bizarre scenario that unfolded June 20
mercilessly ended shortly before 11:30 a.m.
yesterday when Bertuzzi read his decision. The
events preceding the verdict still have heads
spinning all over the hockey world.

The Nordiques traded Lindros’s rights to both
Philadelphia and New York at the National Hockey

League’s draft on June 20.

Shortly after 11:00 a.m. on draft day,
Sportschannel America and Canadian Sports
Network reported from the Montreal Forum that

- Philly and Quebec had consummated the

trade.

However the Nordiques created a circus of
monster proportions by backing out of an agreement
with the Flyers to deal with the Rangers.The
Nordiques further complicated matters by not
contacting the Flyers after the “deal” with New
York had been made. Quebec also neglected to
inform the Rangers that a deal with Philadelphia
had previously been made. '

The real dispute began because Quebec denied
that a handshake agreement was a done deal. The
Flyers contended that a handshake or verbal deal
was as good as any written agreement.

The full ramifications of Quebec’s double-dealing
were not exposed until about 12:15 when the
Nordiques made the fourth selection of the draft
instead of announcing the deal with Philadelphia.
After confronting Quebec General Manager Pierre
Page, Flyers President Jay Snider realized that his
deal was slipping away.

Rangers General Manager Neil Smith did not
understand the confusion on the Forum floor. He
was unaware of the Flyers’ deal and was just as
surprised as Snider.

Smith expected an announcement of a New
York—Quebec deal. No announcement was made.

Morningstar smgbrise
secondpic/e of Celtics

By Brandy L. Simms
Staff Writer

Darren Morningstar came to Pitt three years ago after transferring
from Navy. He was never expected to be much more than a role
player, but he worked hard on developing his skills. Seems like
the hard work has paid off, because he has a bright future ahead
of him in the NBA.

The Boston Celtics were looking for some front line help, and
that’s why they used their second-round pick in last week's
collegiate draft to select the 6-foot-10-inch, 235-pound
Morningstar, who was Pitt’s second leading scorer (12.3 ppg)
and rebounder (6.2) last season.

When Morningstar arrived at Pitt, people laughed at him. All
they saw was a big, slow,‘awkward guy who had no business
playing in the Big East with the likes of Derrick Coleman, Alonzo
Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo.

Morningstar was intent on proving them wrong. He got better
each season and became more than just a role player — he
became a key player. 8

Sean Miller, one of Morningstar’s closest friends, was
instrumental in Morningstar’s development as a player. During
the summer, Miller and Morningstar gotin shape by running the
stairs at Pitt stadium. _

During the ’89—’9O season, his first in a Panther uniform,
Morningstar was used mostly as a backup for Bobby Martin. He
averaged 3.8 points and 2.8 rebounds in 29 games.

The next season he averaged 6.8 points and 4.1 rebounds.

See Star, page 11

Seeing Barry Bonds in agony,
sprawled on the dirt at home

__ plate in New York*s Shea Stadium

shouldn't change anything. 

Seeing Barry Bonds gingerly
traversing down the ramp at the
airport gate in Pittsburgh, holding
his right side as if he had just
been clocked with a left hook to
the gut, shouldn't make a
difference either.

The fact is Barry Bonds — 1990
National League Most Valuable
Player, a1l—star left fielder and
fantastic overall talent (just ask

-him) —— should be traded away
by the Pittsburgh Pirates A.S.A.P.

Period.

While it is unfortunate that the
strained rib cage muscle Bonds
suffered June 14 in New York
will keep him out of the lineup
for several days, the fact remains
that once healthy, Bonds should
be dealt away by the Pirates while
his trade value is still high. The
rationale is simple: the Pirates
cannot afford him and have
absolutely no chance of retaining
his services after this season.
Bonds has already made that
crystal clear. So the question
remains, what should the Pirates
do in order to insure their place
among baseball’s top teams for
years to come? And more
importantly, what should the

Pirates do to ensure that their

present stranglehold on the
National League East continues?

Again, the answer is obvious:
trade Bonds.

Popular opinion tells us that
the Pirates would be committing
competitive suicide if they traded
Bonds to another team. “How
would they ever replace him?”
would be the cry heard all over
Three Rivers Stadium. “They’d

stink without him!” neighborhood
' 1'

,5:

experts would bellow in bars
and taverns all across the ‘burgh.

Granted, anyone who would
argue that Barry Bonds is not a
great player should have his head
examined. But talent alone does
not ensure success. In the grand
scheme of things, Barry Bonds is
more of a liability to the Bucs
than an asset.

His controversial statements
over the past few years have
been highly publicized. Consider:

0 His lashing out at teammate
Jeff King, questioning both his
injury and his desire to play in
the 1990 National League
Championship Series when it was
determined that King was
suffering from a degenerative
condition in his back.

few, have disrupted

Chris
Weber

0 His celebrated pouting
escapade during last year’s spring
training over a contract dispute.
This incident distracted the club
for most of spring training and
brought even normally level-
headed manager Jim Leyland
down into the muck as he blew
his cool in front of the entire
team and chastised Bonds
because of his selfish attitude.

0 His most recent episode
involving accusations that Pirate
fans are racist. This was in
response to fans’ behavior toward
ex—Pirate and newly-hated Met
Bobby Bonilla upon his return to
Three Rivers. Bonds claimed that
the morons who pelted Bonilla
in right field with a golf ball
would never do such a thing to
another former popular Pirate,

Atlanta first baseman Sid Bream,
because Bonilla is black and
Bream is white. ‘
These incidents, toname just a
the
atmosphere surrounding the team‘
and hang over the club like as
dark cloud of turmoil.
Personal behavior aside,
Bonds’s play on the field has also
been subject to criticism. His
performance in the past two NLCS
has been dismal, prompting some
to believe that he chokes when
the chips are down. His
performance in a 16-inning
marathon ,_against the Braves in
mid-May this year serves as a
case in point.
With the game tied and two
out in the bottom of the 15th,
Bonds came up to bat with the
bases loaded. His expression as
he walked to the plate was one
of disgust. He looked angry, as if
he were sick of the ineptitude
displayed by both clubs, as if he
couldn’t wait to finish this game
and put it out of its misery. But
what did this fantastic talent, this
MVP, this man who is allegedly
treated so unfairly by the fans
and organization do?
He grounded out to second.
Players who are traditionally
looked upon as leaders and who
are valuable to their teams are
usually those who take charge in
that kind of situation. They thrive
in the prime-time position in
which they are getting paid to
perform, leaving no doubt that
they have what it takes to lead
their team to a championship.
Bonds is not that player. Not
with the Pirates, anyway.
Yes, it is unfair to judge a
player based on his performance

in one game. But despite his

It’s “1990, Part II”  or maybe
“NLCS, Part VI: ‘Burgh Ball’s
Revenge”?

How about “Deja vu, 1972?”

Or call it a semi-meaningful
four—game series between two

. longtime playoff counterparts.

Take your pick.

Whatever the blurred historical
analogy, the only definitive
comparison in this weekend’s
clash between the first—place
Pirates and Western Division-
leading Cincinnati Reds at Three
Rivers Stadium to playoff teams
in the past — most notably two
years ago in 1990 —— is the position
in the standings both teams
currently occupy in their
respective divisions.

Beyond that reality ~—- with
regards to Mr. Stardust himself -
there’s been plenty of “ch—ch—ch—
changes,” most notably with the
character of Lou Piniella’s Big
Red Machine.

Gone are names like Eric Davis
and Randy Myers, replaced by
emerging contributors like Greg
Swindell, Bip Roberts and Scott
Bankhead.

The results? Like the Cincy
teams of 1970, 1972 or 1990, it
remains the same.

employed a near—facsimile of the
script and cast used in past
successes — great defense, solid
pitching, clutch contributions
from everyone — to‘ ascend to
the Eastern penthouse this year,
the Reds have relied on several
plot changes and different players
to parallel the critical and box-
office success of their world——
championship season of 1990.
Since that blazing title run
through the Pirates and Oakland
A’s two years ago, the Reds have
made several personnel changes
— all of which have proven
beneficial to manager Lou
Piniella’s ballclub. Gone is the
eternally injured and mostly
underachieving Davis (to Los
Angeles), along with unreliable
starters Jack Armstrong and Scott
Scudder (to Cleveland) and the
overpriced Danny Jackson (free
agent to the Cubs), as well as
erratic closer Myers (to San
Diego).
In ‘return for the talented—but—

_inconsistent former Redlegs,

Cincinnati general manager Bob
Quinn nabbed a group of
underrated stars —— that have
emerged from the shadows of
places like northeast Ohio,
southern California and the great
Northwest — to lead the Reds to
the best record in baseball.

The Reds No. 1 starter and ace

of the staff is newcomer Greg ‘
I Swindell. A former refugee of

the disaster area known as the
Cleveland Indians organization,

Rivals meet as Bucs face Red hot Cincy

the tough lefty has been dazzling
in his first year on the senior
circuit.

The University of Texas alum
is 7-2 on the campaign, with a
3.04 earned—run average in 112.2

innings pitched. Along with A

former Dodger Tim Belcher, the
righty-lefty duo gives the
Cincinnati starting pitching staff
the innings and quality to more
than offset the loss of Armstrong
andJackson, as well as the subpar

efforts of mainstays Jose Rijo and

Tom Browning.

On the basepaths and in left
field, ex-Padre Bip Roberts has
become the NL’s premier spark
plug—- as well as made everyone
in southern Ohio forget Eric “The
Former Red.” Entrenched in the
No. 1 hole of the Cincy lineup,
Roberts is hitting a sturdy .300
with 49 runs scored and 21 stolen
bases. In a year that has seen
offensive stars Barry Larkin, Chris
Sabo and Paul O’Neill endure_
either injuries or prolonged
slumps, the Bipster has been the
most consistent hitter on the team.
He also provides Lou Piniella
with versatility in that he can play
second and third base, as well.

Two other new outfielders that

give the Reds versatility and depth’

are former Expo Dave Martinez
and rookie speedster Reggie
Sanders, who share time
patrolling centerfield. The duo
gives Cincy a steady bat, great
defense and speed.

When Martin was felled by injury, Morningstar proved a solid
replacement. _

and was one of the reasons the Panthers made it to the second
round of the,Nationa1 Invitational T ournament,

In Pitt’s victory over Kentucky in the preseason NIT,
Morningstar scored a career—high 27 points. That performance
in front of a national television audience may have made the
NBA scouts stand up and take notice.

On Jan. 8 the Panthers faced an unbeaten Syracuse teamat
the Civic Arena. After rallying from a five-point halftime deficit,
the Panthers defeated the Orangemen 83-74, handing Syracuse
its first loss of the season.

Morningstar played a big part in the upset. He led the
Panthers in scoring with 21 points and grabbed six rebounds.
“Morningstar was our man,” first—year guard Jerry McCullough
said.

“He’s a bona fide Big East center,” coach Paul Evans said,
“and he’s probably going to be able to play at the next level.”

Did Evans know something the rest of us didn’t?

,There’s no doubt that the 1987 recruiting class that included
Miller, Martin, Jason Matthews and Darelle Porter was a
talented bunch. All four were highly regarded prospects

NBA. None of the aforementioned players was even drafted by
an NBA team. .

A supposed non—prospect, Morningstar had a solid senior
season followed by an all-star performance in an NBA pre-draft
camp and captured the attention of the scouts and general
managers. »

Former Big East commissioner Dave Gavitt, 9 now chief
executive officer for the Boston Celtics, rated Morningstar as
the fifth best pure center available in last week’s draft.

When Evans was at Navy he was able to mold David
Robinson into a dominant center. Even though Morningstar
'wasn’t blessed with raw talent, it appears that he'll have a
chance to continue playing basketball and get paid, too. Not

Olympic ‘Dream T eczm’

Basketball thoughts from a man
who has been in the sun too
long. 

0 Wow! I still haven’t recovered
from watching the Dream1Team
in action.

Running and gunning like that
hasn’t been seen since Pitt’s
intramural basketball season
ended. (Right.) It is easy to see
why Larry Bird and Magicjohnson
were elected co-captains. Masters
at the art of winning, they are
seeing that the ship is run right
and doing the little things that
make for big victories. They
started in a flurry against Cuba
when Magic had five assists in the
first seven minutes and Bird

_ “Windexed” the boards.

Enjoy watching these guys in
Barcelona. It may be the last time
you see them play. Magic, who is
HIV—positive, may come back to

the NBA next year, but it is’

unlikely.

Bird’s back condition has put
his career in jeopardy. He missed
Monday’s game against Canada
(another rout), and head coach
Chuck Daly wants to ensure that
Bird is ready to go in Barce-
lona.

These two players have meant
so much to basketball in general
and have put the NBA where it is
today (with a little help from
Michael Jordan). They were
opponents in one of the greatest
rivalries in sports.

Magic’s Lakers won five titles
in the ’80s while Bird’s Celtics
won three. They came into the
NBA in 1979 as adversaries, and
it would be nice to see them
leave basketball as U.S.
teammates doing something
neither one has accomplished
alone: winning Olympic gold.

0 There areother NBA thoughts
running through my head. Can
the Bulls three-peat? No. Not with

their current roster. Other teams
in the modern era to fail were the
Lakers and the Pistons. They made
no major moves and were unable
to win three straight.

Can the Bulls three- peat with a
few changes? Yes. Michaeljordan
and Scottie Pippen are why the
Bulls are champions. Horace

Michael
Milliron

Grant is a good power forward,
but the rest of the roster is made
of role players. The first thing
they could do is get under the
salary cap and sign European
phenom Toni Kukoc, whom they
drafted in '90 as a second—rounder.
It is believed he could play the
one, two and three positions
and be an impact bench

THE Pl'IT NEWS, Wednesday, July 1, 1992

could be‘tiT6“zSt/97/trm/9 forMagz'lc, Bird

player.

The Bulls could put together
different packages of Stacey King,
Will Perdue, BJ. Armstrong and
maybe even Grant to acquire a
top-ﬂight center or point guard.
They had a good draft, with
Oklahoma State’s Byron Houston
falling to them at the number 27
spot and Matt Steigenga coming
in round two. These rookies could
make some of the aforementioned
names more expendable.

0 Yes, Darren Morningstar can
help the Celtics. The futures of
Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert
Parish are, if not uncertain, at
least very short. The Celts can use
a 6-foot—10-inch body that moves
and bangs. No, Morningstar won’t
be wearing number 33.

6 The Los Angeles Lakers are
hoping that first—rounder Anthony
Peeler can stay out of the
courtroom and on the court.
Peeler’s talent is no gamble. At

the point‘ he can give the Lakers
a much needed penetrator (on
the court, mind you) and long-
range shooter. Some youthful
athleticism can’t hurt the Lakers
backcourt, either.

Lakers general manager Jerry
West may still try to pull the
trigger on a Hakeem Olajuwon
or Derek Harper deal. Withjames
Worthy appearing to be headed

out of L.A., what the Lakers

really need is the guy wearing
number 15 for the Olympic
team to pull a “Magical”
comeback.

0 There were some teams that
really helped themselves in the
draft. Obviously the Orlando
Magic did well in winning the
Shaquille O’Neal sweepstakes.
However they should nix the
idea of matching any offer sheets
to Stanley Roberts. What has he
done to warrant $3 million per
year?

and, if handled properly, gain
two (possibly more) in return
who might strengthen weak areas
of the club.

Bonds has made no secret that
he wants to return to play near
his home in Southern California.
Los Angeles, San Diego and
California would appear to be
obvious destinations. Bonds is
very attractive to many teams,
each with its own reason.

With the Dodgers in need of a
healthy body in left field (Eric
Davis’ health condition, and his
contract, are very much in doubt),
the Padres looking for a left fielder
to further strengthen their lineup
in order to stay competitive in
the brutal NL West and the Angels
in desperate need of a marquee
name to bring excitement

West
logical.
Each of these clubs would have
no problem meeting Bonds’s
contract demands, since all are

Saw RDHY

Coast would seem

in big-market cities and gross
enough to afford his price.

In addition, the lure of playing
out the rest of his career at home
and being close to his family may
make Bonds easier to sign when
his current contract of over $4
million expires this year.

What should the Pirates
demand in return? Clearly,
pitching is a must. Leyland has
been playing musical starters with
the fourth and fifth spots in the
rotation since Bob Walk went
down (once again) with a pulled
groin muscle, and young left-
hander Denny Neagle hasn’t
developed as well as hoped.
Leyland’s use of “The Committee”
to fill out the rotation (i.e., Vicente
Palacios, Bob Patterson, et al)
has been satisfactory so far, but
reason tells us it can’t last and
must be addressed.

Bonds’s value could bring to
Pittsburgh one quality left-hander
and possibly a stopper (although
relief ace Stan Belinda seems to

have himself back on track after
miserable play in late-May and
early-June). Jim Abbott, Craig
Lefferts and Mark Langston are
among those conceivably
available for the asking price of
Bonds.

Replacing Bonds offensively
can also be done. Although Cecil

‘ESPY. Gary Varsho and Lloyd

McClendon are not nearly in the
class of Barry Bonds offensively,
Leyland is a master at getting the
most out of role players. Of course
a trade involving Bonds for

. offensive purposes could bring a

player like Tony Gwynn of the
Padres or Junior Felix of the
Angels to Pittsburgh.

By acquiring Gwynn or Felix,
the Pirates could move Orlando
Merced to left and make room
for Gwynn or Felix in right.
Merced may leave the Bucs
weaker defensively in left, but
the drop—offwouldn’tbe much.

Clearly, the time for the Pirates
to act is now. They are at a

_- crossroads and mustmake a

decision that will benefit the team.

Giving Bonds what he wants,

make whilethey still can.

went to the league with their
problem, and all hell broke

loose.

The NHL heard the Flyers’
complaint and suspended
the deal until all parties could
come together and hear the
case. The league announced that
all three clubs would submit
to the independent arbitr-
ation process with no
compromises.

The key here was that all
parties agreed in advance, that
the final decision -~ would -be
binding with no right of appeal.

V The hearings were conducted

without-rampantspeculation-and
daily.;~r.umor.».-. . .-   

The league stated on June .20
that the process would begin on
June 21 with a decision to come
rapidly. But this is the NHL: the
hearing did not even begin until

”June'22’ anddragged on for the‘ ' ‘

entire week.

Bucs
Continued from page 11
Another area of the Cincy

lineup that was shored up by off-

season transactions is the bullpen.

In light of the loss of Randy

Myers and the injury ‘to Rob

Dibble’s shoulder, the Reds

converted set—up man Norm

Charlton into a closer.

The move left a huge vacancy
at middle relief . .. a vacancy that
has been filled quite adequately
in the form of Scott Bank
head. 7 - A
Despite pitching less than 40
innings, the Reds righty has
posted a team-high eight wins,
going 8-1 with a sterling 2.03
ERA. The emergence of
Bankhead has taken a load off
both Charlton and Dibble, who
have combined for 28 saves.
Charlton boasts a gaudy 2.08
ERA and is leading the NL with
17 saves, while Dibble has been
adequate in regaining his past
form, posting 11 saves with an
ERA—of 4.41.

From the starting pitching staff
to the outfield and basepaths
and right to the bullpen,
Cincinnati is prohibitively better
than the team that won the title
in 1990 — thanks to a lethal
injection of consistent pitching,
speed and defense. And while
the Reds will need explosive

second halves from stars like ,

Larkin, Rijo and Sabo to lead the
team past the hard—charging
Braves, they can thank the
newcomers for giving them the
chance.

The Flyers’ brass became
frustrated with proving its case
against Page and Quebec
President Marcel Aubut. The
Flyers’ strategy rested with
ruining the credibility of an
already shady organization.
Bertuzzi listened and sorted fact
from deception. .

“The issue before me is
whether Philadelphia made an
enforceable deal with Quebec
with respect to Lindros,” he
said.

Bertuzzi acknowledged that

-Quebec had every right to
get the best possible value

for Lindros, but by escalating
the stakes at every oppors
tunity, inevitably the Not;

boundaries. '

Bertuzzi confirmed that

years.

“This was not a dispute over
whether an oral deal carries more
or less weight,” he said. “No new
standards will be created by this
deal."

Bertuzzi explained that
Philadelphia relied on “common
sense principles.” This became
difficult for Quebec to com-
bat.

Ever since Quebec drafted
Lindros a year ago, Aubut denied
any team permission to speak
with Lindros. I '0

It was common knowledge that
Quebec-would not allow a team
to do this unless a deal‘ was

made-. Ultimately this condition

made Bertu-zzi’s decision quite
obvious. .. - A ~
The -seven or eight leading
contenders for Lindros all had
conditions when negotiating.

Snider and the'Flyers maintained

all along that their deal was

"cont'ing‘en‘t’“ upon "Lif1d‘t‘OS"’S “

signability. l

Com

After many requests to call
Lindros were denied, Snider
finally accepted an offer from
Aubut around‘1:0O a.m. on the
night before the draft.

The next morning Snider and
Aubut finalized the trade when
Snider asked permission to
phone the Lindros family
and Aubut consented by
giving Lindros’s number to
Snider.

At this point the deal was
complete in the Flyers’ minds.
Bertuzzi found this to be
fact.

‘-‘It is not surprising that this
affair wound up the way it did,”
he said.

“I ﬁnd that Philadelphia made
an enforce able deal with Quebec.
Snider’s acceptance of Aubut’s
terms at 10:30 a.m. and Aubut
presenting Snider with Lindros’s
phone number is clear evidence
of a Phi1adelphia—Quebec deal,”
Lindros said. i

It should be noted that both

Bertuzzi and the Flyers said none
of the blame should fall on New
York.

The, Rangers were only
innocent bystanders trying to
make a deal,notunderrnine other
clubs.

But you have to wonder just
how hard the Rangers would
have pushed their offer if it would
have been, say, the Vancouver
Canucks and not the Flyers
attempting to acquire “the Next
One.”

The convincing argument in-
the hearing likley came fromthe
Lindros family. -. . ~, .

Bertuzzi and officials of the‘
organizations-declined to provide
detailsof all witnesses, but it is
believed .that Chicago General
Manager Mike Keenan and New
Jersey General Manager Lou
Lamoriello took the stand.
