Six Pitt
officers
receive
pay raises

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Pitt’s Board of Trustees Compensa-
tion Committee approved salary in-
creases averaging3.1 percent for six
University oflicers Monday morning
for the 2011-2012 ﬁscal year.

During a 15-minute conference
call, the Board voted to increase
the salaries of those six officers,
bringing the six salaries to a total
of $3,042,000. The salary increases
are compatible with raises that have
been rewarded to other Pitt employ-
ees, according to Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg.

Nordenberg requested that his
$561,000 salary not be increased
for next year, in light of the eco-
nomic hardships the University is
facing. .

Board chairman Stephen Tritch
said that the salaries are tied to the
University’s annual state appropria-

tion, from which Pitt lost $40 mil- ,

lion this year. Because of the loss in
state ﬁinding, Pitt increased in-state
tuition 8.5 percent to help close the
$70 million budget gap the Univer-
sity faced. But the salary increases
were recommended on Tuesday
because of the “institutional per-

formance and contributions made .

by those ofﬁcers,” Tritch said.
Patricia Beeson, provost and se-
nior vice chancellor, received the
biggest salary increase by percent-
age at 4.6 percent.
Her current salary of $325,000

Artists to
sell   Work

in Union

Mahita Gajanan
For The Pitt News

When students walk through the
William Pitt Union on Wednesday,
they’ll see dozens of local artists’
work —— from steampunk jewelry
to clay clocks — brought together
by a Pitt graduate.

About 30 local artisans will
sell their wares from 11 a.m. to
4 p.m. at the I Made it! Original,
the latest iteration of the no-
madic I Made It! Market which
sells handmade crafts through-
out Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods.

. The events are sponsored in part

by The Original Magazine, a Pitt
student—run creative writing pub-

. lication.

“The mission is to provide
an opportunity for local artists
to sell their wares,” said Carrie
Nardini, founder of the I Made
it! Market. The market partners
with nonproﬁt and community
organizations to raise funds and
awareness of art in Pittsburgh.

Hilary Nykwest, the editor of
The Original, said the magazine

loves the I Made It! Market be-

cause the event features various
creative individuals in the Pitts-
burgh area. All of the funds raised

at the event go to the I Made It! '

Market, she said.

“The quality of their products
is so impressive and unique,” Nyk-
west said. “They have a mission
that I argue no one can deny —
support for the arts and creative’

Last week, Pitt junior Aziza Khalil be-
gan the apartment hunt in hopes of
moving off campus her senior year.

Khalil currently lives in Bouquet
Cardens, but she and her roommates
hope to rent a four— or ﬁve—bedroom
house next year. Their criteria: a laun-
dry roominthe house and aSouth Oak-
land location no further from campus
than Parkview Avenue. However; the
group of girls has met some difficulty.

“A lot of landlords aren’t showing
untiljanuary,” she said.

With two ofKha1il’s roommates go-
ing abroad next semester, thejanuary
date poses a problem for the prospec-
tive renters. But according to local
landlords, it’s normal for students to
begin contacting landlords and tour-
ing off-campus apartments fresh off
of winter break — in fact, they rec-
ommend it.

Suzanne Narcini, aPitt alumna and

ment, said in an email that the rental

that apartments rent quickly, especially
if they’re nice. E.S. Management rents

Narcini said that representatives

from E.S. Management don’t rentuntil
January, but interested students can
tour Oakland apartmentbuildings be-
ginning next week. She said that this
gives current tenants time to decide
if they want to renew their leases or
move out.

For students looking to move to
surrounding neighborhoods like
Shadyside, South Side and Squirrel
Hill, Narcini said that she recommends

ruary and March.

Narcini said that her tenants are

and Internet also create an additional
cost, which usually adds about $40 to
the renter’s expenses. These averages
can ﬂuctuate since utility costs vary
dependingonthe time ofyear and ten-
ant conservation.

Narcini said that student_s should
consider average utility costs, types of

they look for their apartments.

Rent for apartments and houses in
Oaklandusually ranges anywherefrom
$500 to $1,100 permonth, depending
on standard of living, whether or not
the spaceis shared and ifthe apartment
has been recently renovated.

As a rule ofthumb, Narcini saidthat
rent should only be about 25 percent
of a person’s income. Since students
generally do not have substantial credit
or income during college, it’s ‘usually
required that any applicant under the
age of 25 have a cosigner.

Narcini said that other important
off-campus housingfactors include the
age and qualityofabuildings windows,
the cleanliness of the building overall
and ifthe hotwatertank is sharedby
multiple units.

Graham, football
season successful

It’s been a tumultuous season for
the Pitt football team.

Last Saturday, the Panthers won
at home against Syracuse, earning
a chance to play in the BBVA Com-
pass Bowl for the second year in a
row. The bowl game has a payout
of nearly $2 million.

Finishing the regular season
with a .500 record didn’t meet
many fans’ hopes, considering
Pitt’s marketing campaign and
costly attainment of head coach
Todd Graham. This season was
billed as being a championship
season, and it didn’t live up to ex-
pectations. But we would hardly
consider it a failure.

Graham is one of just two
coaches in the past 25 years who
managed to take his team to a bowl
game in his ﬁrst season — so his
freshman year is not as much of a
bust as it’s been made out to be.
But USA Today reports that not all
coaches stay around for long.

Now more than ever, schools
are expected to perform well on the
football ﬁeld. And it’s becoming a
trend that ‘universities are letting
go coaches of underperforming
teams after their sophomore sea-
sons.

There are a couple of things
wrong with this type of thinking.
First of all, it’s not ﬁnancially savvy
to buy out one coach’s contract
while enacting a new one. This also
doesn’t allow for a coach to assimi-
late himself into his new school’s
culture, leading into a costly and
time-consuming cycle of ﬁnding
the “right man for the job.”

Secondly, a coach needs four
years at a school in order to com-
pile a team fully composed of his
recruits. Thus, we think any fair
judgment would have to wait until

a coach can run his team the way

 

 

he wants to run it — with his own
players.

Graham’s explosive, no-huddle
offense just doesn’t mesh well with
the kinds of players with whom
he entered the season. Consider-
ing the team’s offensive struggles,
it’s clear that pro-style quarter-

back Tino Sunseri isn’t the type .

of player designed for Graham’s
“high—octane” offense.

And before we blame Graham’s
offense, let’s remember that it’s
been proven to work. In 2005, Rice
University’s football team went
1-10, and just a year later, then-
head coach Graham led his team
to a 7-5 record. .

That being said, this season
could be considered lackluster
in comparison to fans’ expecta-
tions, but it has been anything but
a failure. And we think Graham
has certainly earned the chance
to make it past the second-year
chopping block that many schools
are resorting to.

Even if Pitt doesn’t hold to its
ﬁve-year deal with Graham, we
think he at least deservespfour
years to further prove himself. And
by clinching -a bowl berth in his
ﬁrst season, he also clinched one
last game for his 17 seniors and a
chance for the team to ﬁnish with
a winning season.

Some fans might bemoan the
fact that the team is going to the
same bowl game as last year or ex-
press disappointment in its ﬁnal
record, but we think this season
was a success —- largely because
of Graham’s coaching.

We’re excited to bring in the
new year with one last Pitt football
game. But We’re also excited to see
how Graham fares in his second
season — hopefully with more
to come.

Adderall unworthy of concern

Designer drugs can plague people’s
bodies. They also can plague our col-
lective attention — cue Adderall.

Surely, psychostimulants like Ad-
derall and Ritalin don’t technically
fall under the designer drug category,
but there’s no question that in the
media, keeping the public abreast of
Adderall’s supposed systematic rape
of college students’ academic integ-
rity is all the hype these days. Not a
week seems to go by without national
news shedding light on the issue, and
even The Pitt News editorial board
chimed in last week, wagging a cau-
tionary ﬁnger at our student body
as it launches into ﬁnals-cramming
mode. '

In short, media personnel far
and wide are high on Adderall. But
"let’s kill the glamour: It’s time to de-
toxify.

College students are increasingly
getting their hands and brains on
psychostimulants, often for class
performance purposes — there’s no
arguing with that. What’s also hard
to dispute is that self-adrninistering
psychoactive drugs without a physi-
cian’s prescription or guidance con-

fers heightened health risks to drug
users. But considering the host of
other maladies that threaten student
life, close scrutiny of the nonmedical
use of Adderall and Ritalin on cam-
pus has hogged our time and effort,
which society could most surely
use more productively. As well, we

shouldn’t encourage University ad-—

ministrators to spend too many tu-
ition dollars on toothless education
campaigns.

People commonly think of Ad-
derall as a performance enhancer,
akin to anabolic steroids for body-
builders or nitrous oxide for street
racers. Many commentators, like
Duke University officials and The
Pitt News, go ﬁirther; they consider
using the drugwithoutaprescription
a form of cheating, of providing an
unfair advantage to student abusers
over student abstainers. They all talk
along these lines, conﬁdently, but
no one addresses the room-ﬁlling
elephant: There is absolutely zero
evidence that psychostimulants
improve grades for people without
ADHD.

As far as scientists understand
it, Adderall works by increasing
levels of dopamine, (a modulatory
neurochemical) nonspeciﬁcally
throughout the brain, one effect of
which is to prolong attentiveness.

ci‘itiL‘izes the l1l_\/ll] tlml Atlilemll .‘1ll'ccis ilt'.ltlt’llllL' pm'l'ui'1n.'1m‘c.

M This effect in particular has proven

highly therapeutic for people suffer-
ing from attention deﬁcit disorders.
Searching for paths of least resis-
tance, some students unburdened
by attention problems have looked
at this observation and proceeded
to extrapolate. That is, a brave few
progenitor abusers, and now college
culture in its entirety, have silently
reinforced the troubled conclusion
that Adderall boosts GPAs.Just like
thousands of 17th-century Dutch in-
vestors thought buying tulip bulbs
would end theirﬁnancial worries —
look it up on Wikipedia ——- thousands
of modem-day college students think
popping attention pills will end their
grade worries. Both manias are fu-
eled by hopes, not facts.

But if anything, at least accord-
ing to the few studies sponsored by
the National Institutes of Health that
address the correlation between aca-
demic performance and nonmedi-
cal use of prescription stimulants,
nonmedical Adderall use either does
nothing to academic performance
or hurts it. That’s because college
students who use Adderall without
prescriptions are already low-per-
formers, and, convinced they can
rely on Adderall as a crutch, they ei-
ther start slacking off academically or

become complacent with their slack-
ing. In this sense, a veritable risk of
rampant Adderall use is the ﬁirther
development of a “last—minute” study
culture, but there’s no evidence to
indicate abusers are warping the
playing ﬁeld by “enhancing” their
test performance. d

To diffuse the hype over psycho-
stimulants, realizing that their preva-
lence doesn’t put academic fairness
in jeopardy is helpful —— but it’s not
enough. What’s even more important

to understand is the fact that,,as a ,

with a simple, “Yes,” too embar-
rassed to admit fhey’re Jewish, or
too tired of explaining themselves
every time they mention their re-
ligion. _ ’

Now that Santa’s set up shop in

borhoods are aglow with Christmas
lights,Jews often resign themselves
to accepting the above questions
and holiday greetings — if only
so something like a quick trip to

But to everyone considering this

to proclaim, “I’mJewish!” ,

There are also people who know
you’re Jewish and ask if you cele-

No, it’s not hard, but you’re making

on Christmas because I’m Jewish,
and I received presents during the
eight nights of Hanukkah. I got an
iPod, some sweaters and a boat-
load of new socks and underwear.
I had my holiday fun and now it’s

Chrismukkah. Some members of

like “The O.C.” and “Grey’s Anat-

— have embraced Chrismukkah, a
Christmas-Hanukkah hybrid. But
it’s not a legitimate celebration,
and only confuses non—Jews -
causing them to ask some of the
aforementioned questions.

In my own household, we’ve
kicked out the Hanukkah bush —
a bush that mimics the Christmas
tree and has no signiﬁcance to the
Jewish holiday — and have resist-
ed the urge to cover our house in
lights (something my mother is still
tempted to do every year). I can
hear protests forming now: “What’s
wrong with a harmless tree and
some lights?” The lights, however,
enticing as they might be, replaced
the candles with which Christians
decorated their Christmas trees
and eventually found their way
outside. Sure, Jews celebrate_the
Festival of Lights, but it’s a minor
holiday that’s all about the candles.
If anyJewish holiday would be rain-

health risk that doesn’t fail to harm
college students, Adderall and Ritalin
are dwarfed hands—down_ by another
substance you might have heard of:
alcohol. While the psychostimulants
carry little addictive potential or his-
tory of serious health consequences,
alcohol abuse is everywhere and
regularly exacts enormous costs on
college students, their families and
surrounding collegiate communities.
It causes thousands of deaths and is
involved in hundreds of thousands of
assaults and injuries each year among

bow—light worthy, it would be Rosh
Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.
Of course, manyjewish people
have, in fact, adopted a number of
Yuletide practices. Christmas, in
some ways, is a global festival in
which all Americans participate
— I’m eating a candy cane as I type
this. Jews have created their own-
traditions for the day, like eating
Chinese food, going to the movies
and volunteering. My mom and I
have participated in Pittsburgh’s
Mitzvah Day for the past ﬁve
years. Across the U.S., thousands
upon thousands of Jews perform

mitzvahs —'— good deeds — on ~’

Christmas, from serving Christ-
mas meals to delivering presents
to the less fortunate. Heck, Jewish
people have even written some of
the most popular Christmas songs
of all time, such as Irving Berlin’s
“White Christmas.” We’re deﬁnitely
down with Rudolph and strings of
lights adorning _every nook and
cranny of our town. ,
However, there are only 5.2 mil-
lionjewish Americans —— less than

people aged 18 to 24, according to

the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services. So if there’s ever a
drug toward which the media should
direct its spotlight and administra-
tors should focus their mitigatory
efforts, it’s not Adderall. It’s beer.

After all, it’s surprising no one
points at alcohol for warping the
academic playing ﬁeld — talk about
something that actually affects stu-
dent potential.

Be‘ prud of Jewish heritage during holidays

2 percent of the country’s popu-
lation —— and only 4.3 million of
them attend Passover Seders and
light Hanukkah candles, according
to the National Jewish Population
Survey. Thus, some of us need to
be more assertive concerningour
Old Testament beliefs. December
is the perfect time to take a stand.
Although Hanukkah is a minor
holiday injudaism, it’s important
for Jewish American children to
have a December present—receiving
celebration. It’s also important be-
cause it’s the time each year when
Jews can afﬁrm their identity and
culture, and spurn assimilation.

Sojews, light your candles, wish
the grocery store cashier “Happy
Holidays!” and don’t shy away from
using this holiday-riddled month
as an opportunity to show and tell
people what Judaism is’ all about.
And if you don’t get the chance
this year, don’t worry — April, the
month of Passover and Easter, is
fast approaching.

PENS, FLYERS RIVALRY TRANSFORMS

By Patrick Wagner
STAFF WRITER

Traversing the hundreds of
miles of agrarian Pennsylvania
between them, the Philadel-
ph_ia Flyers and the Pittsburgh
Penguins battle every winter to
prove the professional worth of
their highly lauded teams. Clad
in thick pads and equipped with
club—like sticks, both teams seek
victory not just for their hockey
clubs, but also for their side of
the state.

On Pitt’s campus, the rivalry
is particularly ampliﬁed with
almost as many Philadelphians
present in orange and black
as native Yinzers in black and
gold. Even so, the contest be-
tween Eastern and Western
Pennsylvania dates back to a
time before either Pittsburgh
or Philadelphia had a sports

team.

“It goes back to the histori—‘

cal rivalry between the frontier
West and the supposedly more
civilized East,” said Rob Ruck, a
senior lecturer in Pitt’s~ history
department. He noted that the
contest goes back to the early co-
lonial period.

“It’s a question of political
power,” Ruck said. “Why do you
think that Harrisburg is in the
center of the state?”

Despite their differences, the
teams and cities now have more
similarities than they did in
the past.The Penguins and Fly-
ers franchises both were estab-
lished in 1967. While the Flyers
won their ﬁrst Stanley Cup in the
early 1970s, the
Penguins ac-

complished

the same
feat on a very
memorable
 day in late May
of 1991.

“When the
Pens won
their ﬁrst
Stanley
Cup, I

wasn’t even 2 years old, but my
parents naturally tookme along
to a playoff party,” Pitt senior
Jamie Novak said. “During the
ensuing celebration, as a bunch
of crazed fans passed around a
replica Stanley Cup full of cham-
pagne, I was reportedly offered
the Cup. Istuck my whole face in
it  and loved it. I think my team
allegiance was pretty much set
from then on out.”

Hockey fans from the other
side of the state have had similar
experiences —— with family play-
ing an important part in what
makes hockey so compelling to
watch. .

“Growing up in a suburb out-
side of Philadelphia, _I was sur-
rounded by Flyers fans,” sopho-
more Vince Cuce said. “During
high school my friends and I
would always talk about the Fly-
ers and how they were doing, but
during the last couple seasons
my younger brother has become
an avid Flyers fan as well, and
we always watch games together
whenever I’m home now.”

Today, Novak and Cuce might
be known to argue for their re-
spective teams, but their passion
for the sport comes from a very
real love of the game.

“The main thing that at-

tracted me to hockey is the 
intensity,” Cuce said. ‘A
“The players skate for
60 minutes end
‘ to end, not to
mention it has
such a quick ,
pace with :5’,

high-caliber players on all 30
teams.” H

The concentrated physicality
of the sport easily inspires pas-
sion for Novak.

“The aspect of hockey that at— —

tracts me the most is the incom-
parable level of intensity,” Novak

said. “I have seen professional
games go eight minutes without a .

stoppage in play. And for that en-
tire duration, the players never

. stop moving, circulating, check-

ing, passing and shooting.”

In Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh
was the ﬁrst city to have a team
enter the NHL. Named after the
Pirates team that had trans-
ferred from an amateur league in
1925, the freshman hockey team

- couldn’t

the winning numbers to ensure
longevity.

.“Due to sagging attendance
and tight ﬁnances, the team’s

_owners were unable to secure
enough talent to keep the team
competitive,” sports writer Rick
Buker of the Penguin Poopblog
said. During this time the team
played at Duquesne Gardens,
anarena located on North Craig

Street where the Saint Paul Ca-
thedral now stands,

_ “During its ﬁnal season in
Pittsburgh — 1929-1930 — the
team switched its colors from
black, and gold to orange and
black,” Buker said. “With that
iconic color change, the team
headed to a more favorable mar-
ket in Philadelphia, changing its
name to the Quakers. The Fly-

‘. ers still use the black and orange

color scheme to this day.

Occupy plans for future

By Dan Law
&

Brian Dollard
STAFF WRITERS

Nick McMahon crawled on his hands and
knees digging up topsoil in the ﬂower beds
surrounding a fenced-in modern art dis-
play. Last Friday was his second day plant-
ing tulip bulbs in Mellon Green, working
for the Brickman Group under contract

_ from BNY Mellon.

“Well, I’m not sure what happened
to our grass contract, but obviously, we
haven’t mowed,” McMahon joked, refer-
ring to the dozens of tents currently ob-
scuring the grass of Mellon Green.

Despite their resultinglin the loss of

_ some mowing work, McMahon said the

protesters were friendly stewards of the
community space. I

“They actually came up to us right away
and asked if we needed anything moved
and if we needed any help,” McMahon
said. _

Just like the tulip bulbs McMahon was
planting, Occupy Pittsburgh seeks to solid-
ify its organizational “-roots” by enduring

the long Pittsburgh winter. Coined Occupy '

Pittsburgh 2.0, the protesters have created
a strategy that revolves around two initia-
tives: ﬁnancial stability and strategic plan-
ning. A “winterization” working group has
made plans to tear down the camp and re-

construct it in order to make it suitable for
the harsher winter weather.

After that, a Special Planning Assembly
will involve multiple working groups and
will focus on an in-depth evaluation of the
movement’s principles and goals.

Supplies, food and logistics are con-
cerns for the protesters as they plan for
the upcoming months, but Occupiers con-
sider the movement’s ﬁnances a critical is-

— sue — one that has yet to be rectiﬁed. By

seeking a “ﬁscal sponsorship” through the
Thomas Merton Center, Occupiers are at-
tempting to attain some ﬁnancial stability
and a way to process the substantial level
of monetary donations coming in daily.

A small group of Occupiers have met l

with representatives of the Thomas Mer-
ton Center about sponsorship and have
drafted an agreement that would create a
“trusteeship” with as many as one dozen
named olﬁcers in charge of the funds. The
inclusion of a trusteeship and formal lead-
ership appears to contradict Occupy Pitts-
burgh’s self-described leaderless structure
and the structures of other Occupy move-
ments across the country. .‘

The conflict comes around the same
time that many of the Occupy movements
— in Philadelphia, New York and Washing-
ton — have been pushed out of the space
in which many of the groups had camped
for a month or more. -

Hush Money

The possible "sponsorship from the

. Thomas Merton Center is a lingering issue

in the conversation about Occupy Pitts-
burgh’s future. Occupy Pittsburgh’s Draft-

ing Community is charged with determin-

ing the terms of that issue.
With only 47 members listed on the
group’s Facebook page, those involved pri-

marily also serve as the various bottom- -

liners and unofficial leaders within Occupy
Pittsburgh. Currently, upwards of 12,000
people have ‘liked’, Occupy Pittsburgh on
Facebook. V .

Yet, it appears any ﬁscal sponsorship
agreement will contain a provision to
solidify -those leaders in the movement
through a trusteeship, according to a Nov.
21 draft — the most recent -—- of the “Oc-
cupy Pittsburgh Community Fund: Trust
and Plan; Bylaws” on the Occupy Pitts-
burgh Drafting Community’s Facebook
page. °

It describes the creation of trustee-
ship in the Occupy Pittsburgh Community
Fund, which would lead to the formation
of a group consisting ‘of between six and
12 members serving for one-year terms —
including one ex-ofﬁcio, non-voting trust-
ee selected by the ﬁscal sponsor.

The responsibilities of the trustees
as granted” in the draft include distribut-
ing and tracking funds necessary for the
group. Treasurer of the Thomas Merton
Center Edward Kinley conﬁrmed the dis-
cussions between the two groups in an
email.

“There have been discussions between
Occupy Pittsburgh and the Thomas Mer-
ton Center regarding ﬁscal sponsorship.
These discussions have been with one of

the working groups and not Occupy Pitts- ‘

burgh as a whole andlhave been amicable
and constructive. However, there is no
ﬁrm proposal on the table at this time for
consideration,” he said.

Members of Occupy. Pittsburgh. also
conﬁrmed an ongoing negotiation between
the two parties but declined to elaborate.

No speciﬁc leadership has been official-
ly appointed by either Occupy Pittsburgh
or the Thomas Merton Center to address
the issue. However, multiple meetings
have been held off—site by members of Oc-
cupy Pittsburgh discussing the issue of ﬁs-
cal sponsorship. ’

Matt Lawson —— a member of the Draft-
ing Community — previously stated his
personal opposition to a deﬁned organiza-
tion. “Implementing ourselves as a non-
proﬁt organization is completely against
what we stand for,” he said.

Lawson declined to elaborate on the
details of possible changes.

The General Assembly approved Oc-

cupy Pittsburgh 2.0, which will try to im— ‘

prove the foundations of the movement by
both a physical and conceptual reconstruc-
tion. _

An originator of the idea, David Meier-
an, 50, viewed the cooling of the weather
as any opportunity for _the camp to start
fresh.

“We’ve been here a while. What do we
do as it gets colder?” he said.

While the Occupy Pittsburgh move-
ment gears up for winter, more than half
a dozen of the other branches of Occupy
Wall Street have been pushed out of public
spaces in the past month. A representa-
tive from Bank of New York Mellon, which
owns the Mellon Green currently occupied
by protesters, declined to comment on the
bank’s plans for the future of the Occupy
encampment. 

The initial stage of 2.0 —— launching on
Dec. 11 — involves the total deconstruction
of the current camping site, Meieran said.
They plan is to clean the grounds and lay
down mulch, though the strategy is not yet
ﬁnalized. The reconstruction will include
a focus on weatherizing the encampment
from the harsh conditions, Meieran said.

“As winter’s approaching, we obviously
need to refortify our structures so that we
can withstand the winter. We’ve been get-
ting some winter supplies. For example,
Occupy Supply delivers winter supplies
for a lot of the Occupations. Their goal is
to get American—made, union—made prod-
ucts. They have given us more than $3,000
worth of supplies so far,” Meieran said.

Beyond better preparing for the ele-
ments, Meieran said Occupy. Pittsburgh
2.0 aims to improve the logistical issues
that currently exist within the camp. Any-
where between 40 and 80 people stay at
the camp, depending on the day of the
week. More Occupiers seem to come in and
stay during the weekends.

Currently, the Occupy Pittsburgh web-
site features requests for donors to replen-
ish the group’s low supplies of food, warm
clothing and other amenities.

Dan Lichten —— a bottom—liner for the
food working group — said he was not
aware of the details of the transition pro-
cess or any other speciﬁcs pertaining to
Occupy Pittsburgh 2.0. Focusing on orga-
nization and logistics for the movement’s

' food supply has kept Lichten busy. He says

LEMIEUX‘, CROSBY

Hockey 4 6

NHL in the 1930-1931 season. Unfortu-
nately, the team fared worse than when in
Pittsburgh: The Quakers were awful. After
one losing season, the team folded, and

_ only minor league hockey would hold up

in Pennsylvania for the next 37 years.
When the NHL decided to expand from

‘six to 12 teams in thelmid-1960s, the fro-

zen ﬁelds and asphalt. streets of Pennsyl-
vania appealed to the league as a prime
hockey market. Wearing their respective
blue and orange, -the Pittsburgh Penguins

and the Philadelphia Flyers "played the-

ﬁrst home game’ in Philadelphia’s Spec-

trum Arena on Oct. 19, 1967.’This ﬁrst’

meeting resulted in a 1-0 victory for the
Flyers, who would dominate the ice for the
following decade.

During the 1970s, the Flyers’ tenden-
cy to spar frequently on the ice earned
them a reputation for violent tactics and
the nickname “The Broad Street Bullies.”
Throughout this era Philadelphia domi-
nated —‘ not just the Penguins, but also
the league, becoming the ﬁrst expansion
team to win a Stanley Cup in 1974.

Yet across. the state, the Penguins 3'

weren’t content to continue their losing
streak. A man named Mario would soon
give the Penguins’ -name glory.

“The Penguins were on life support
when they drafted Mario Lemieux with the
ﬁrst overall pick in the 1984 Draft,” Buker
said. Within the next ﬁve years, Lemieux
and the 1988 Penguins accomplished what
had seemed impossible: defeating the Fly-
ers in the Spectrum on Feb. 2, 1989.

The Penguins would go on to thrash the
entire league during the early 1990s, win-
ning two Stanley Cups in 1991 and 1992.‘

“A couple of generations since then
have grown up loving hockey,” Ruck said.
With their uniforms changed to‘ the colors
of other famed Pittsburgh teams — black
and gold —- and the development of a
Pittsburgh-worthy winning record, the

Penguins became an integral part of the

city. .
In an effort to improve their standings,
the Broad Street Bullies acquired hockey

protegé Eric Lindros and embraced a dif—'

ferent type of play from their cross-state
rivals. V ‘

“While the Pens embraced a more
skilled, artistic approach,” Buker said,
“the Flyers returned to their bristling,
body—banging roots.” A tradition of the
Flyers’ “old—time hockey” remained, and
by 2000, a series of close contests be-
tween well-balanced players created a
sense of camaraderie across the state.

  REVAMP PROGRAM

“The bad blood that ﬂowed for years
gave way to mutual respect,” Buker said.
While the Flyers remained victorious dur-
ing this time, yet another Pittsburgh arriv-
al would change the game. Canada’s latest
import; who spent his childhood shooting

pucks at his dryer, would turn the Pen-

guins’ luck in the rivalry across the state.

Sidney Crosby is a polarizing ﬁgure
who receives an equal amount of scorn
from fans of other franchises as he gar-
ners praise from Penguins fans, who adore
their team’s captain. .

“You always expect the unexpected
with Crosby,” Novak said. “You believe
the unbelievable. I realize that you may
have just gagged at that cheesiness, but it
doesn’t negate the fact that it’s true.”

The‘ popularity of an athlete hailed as
“the next great one” is easily visible in the
variety of jerseys that move along Forbes
and Fifth avenuesion a game day. Eighty-
seven —— a number correlating with Cros-
by’s..birthday, Aug. 7, 1987 — is blocked
out in Pittsbi1rgh’s traditional black and
gold, or the throwback dark blue jerseys
show Penguins pride.

In 2009, Crosby ledithe Penguins to
their ﬁrst Stanley Cup victory in 17 years.
His skill and ever-growing celebrity over-
whelms at least one Flyers fan.

“I guess it’s’ good for the Penguins,”
Cuce noted of Crosby’s ‘recent return
to the ice. “I think it was kind of over-
hyped and blown way out of proportion,
though.” This sentiment underlines the
phenomenon that allows a player to be an
asset to one team and an ominous ﬁgure
to another.

The Flyers have continued a success- I

ful run for the past few years with stars
of their own, watched by their many fans
from dorms, apartments or wherever the

game, can be caught in this “out—of—mar—

ket” region.
Cuce pointed toward 'Phi1adelphia’s

sharp—eyed center Claude Giroux, Finn-.

ish-born defenseman Kimmo Timonen
and newcomer Matt Read from the AHL’s
Adirondack Phantoms.

“They leave everything on the ice each
night and give it their best in every game
they lace up their skates,” Cuce said. With
the addition of seasoned players like for-
mer Penguin Jaromir jagr, the Flyers have
shown their own resilience in light of a
changing lineup. ‘ ~

“No one expected the Flyers to be able

Panthers move on without Woodall, prep for VMI

The Pitt men’s basketball teamis
still adjusting to life without its
starting point guard.

Despite picking up a 61-56 win
at Tennessee over the weekend,
the Panthers’ offense struggled
to ﬁnd a rhythm for much of the
team’s first game following the
announcement that redshirt ju-

-vnior Tray Woodall would mis's
four to six weeks with abdominal
and groin injuries.

“People had written us off
without Tray being in there,” Pitt
head coachjamie Dixon said after
Saturday’s victory. “We’ve got to
get [our other guards] better.”

Those guards would be fresh-
men Cameron Wright and John
Johnson, who both will see a steep
rise in minutes while Woodall is
out.

Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

"The NFL season is rounding the.
home stretch, and as December
unfolds and winter sets in, it’s time

to start making some playoffpre— '

dictions.
This season has been a roller-
ngoaster ride for many teams —
from the Bears to the jets to the
Chargers. Injuries, poor luck and
disciplinary issues have helped
teams go from division leaders
to missing the playoffs. So with
‘T only three more weeks to go; here
is how I see the playoffs shaking
out.

The American Football Confer-
ence is traditionally stronger in
the NFL, and I think that holds

I iarue again this season. It looks as
though the New England Patriots
and the Houston Texans are a near
lock for their division titles, so

I’m going to go ahead and punch
them in right now.

The Pats, as always, are just
too well—rounded and too well-
coached to drop a two—game lead
in the division this late in the sea-
son. Not only that, but thejets —
who are hot on New England’s tail

— have proven they don’t have the

quarterback to run the table.
Houston — even though the
team probably just lost Andre
Johnson again, has a backup quar-
terback playing and is still waiting
for Arian Foster to be completely
healthy — just keeps ﬁnding ways
to win. If this team didn’t have so
many injury problems, it might be
the second—best team in the NFL.
Regardless, I don’t see the Titans
catching the Texans, and that’s

_ why I think they’re a sure bet for

the AFC South.
From there, things get a little
trickier. The Steelers and the

Pitt ﬁnishes 8th in Las

Staff Writer

Wrestling as a top-10 ranked
team for the first time since 1963,
the Panthers ﬁnished in eighth
place out of a ﬁeld of 34 teams
at the Cliff Keen Invitational in
Las Vegas last weekend.

The finish was a bit of a dis-
appointment for. the Panthers,
who rose from No. 11 to No. 8
in national rankings following a
thrilling win'over Michigan last
week.

“It’s a heck of a tournament
out there in Las Vegas,” head
coach Rande Stottlemyer said.
“To finish in the top 10 in the

Anthony Zanetta, Tyler Nauman,

“Overall we could have done a

“It’s bound to happen. We’ve
wrestled against some really
good teams, so we’re bound to
take a step back at some point.
We’re still working some guys
back from injury, so We’re still

improving.”
Zanetta had a seventh-

“Matt has been a steady part

“In the semifinals, against the
kid from Indiana, [Powless]
went out there and scored the
first takedown and controlled the
match. Late in the match he went
straight at Matt and threw every-

points, but he should be able to
bounce back for us.”

Nauman ﬁnished fourth at 149

vid Habat of Edinboro. Nauman
defeated Habat 6-5 earlier this
season at the Buffalo Open. The
redshirt senior Panther , now
ranked No. 4»in the nation, won
two bouts with ease to start the
tournament before the 5-2 upset
at the hands of Habat dropped
him to the consolations.

Saul (12 .

Broncos currently lead the other
two divisions, but I’m not sold on
the Broncos and I don’t think the
Steelers are any better than the
Ravens this year. I

Fortunately for Denver, its
schedule is a cakewalk — with
the exception of its game against
the Patriots in two weeks. The
Broncos should handle the quar-
terback—deprived Bears, lose one
more game this year to the Pats
and ﬁnish 10-6. The Raiders, who
are even with the Broncos -now,
just can’t seem to hang on to any
consistency, or at least not enough
for me to think they’re a real con-
tender.

_ I’ll give Pittsburgh, and the
division, the beneﬁt of the doubt
and bet the Jets and the Ravens
take the ﬁnal two playoff spots and
the wildcard.

From there, you can expect the
Jets and the Broncos to go down
in the ﬁrst round. Houston won’t
have enough players standing
to get past the Steelers, and the
Ravens won’t be able to handle
a team like the Patriots. I usually
wouldn’t bet against Pittsburgh in
the playoffs, but something tells
me Tom Brady is hungry again
like he was a few years ago and
he’ll be back in the Super Bowl
this season. ‘

NFC:

Aside from the Packers and the

Saints, the NFC is a total conun-
drum.

If you asked me at Week 6, I
probably would have told you the
Falcons and the Redskins were
taking wildcard spots, that the
Bears were looking too good to
be beaten and that the Lions were
ﬁnally a contender. But just a few
weeks later, much has changed.

It looks as though the Pack-
ers will run away with the NFC
North, which is no surprise after
they won the Super Bowl with half
their team on Injured Reserve last
year. - _

The Saints are ﬁnally catching
ﬁre, and they made a big state-
ment with a dominant win over
the Giants. Then, on Sunday night,
in front of the whole country, they
demonstrated how young and
dumb the Detroit Lions were -
beating them both between the
lines and in character. They look
like a clear division winner in the
South. '

The NFC West has been over for
weeks, as the San Francisco 49ers
look like they’re back in the glory
days of the ’8os. They’re sitting
pretty at 10-2 with one of the N FL’s
best defenses and a run game that
is simply rolling right now.

In the East, things are a little
more complicated. The Giants,
the Cowboys, the Eagles and the
Redskins have all been competing

1.1.

Packers, Pats to meet after
rolling through playoffs 

for who can stink the least this
year, but the Giants had me sold
in their near—win over the Pact’!-
ers on Sunday. I just can’t see the
Cowboys beating New York next

week, and I think the Giants will‘

take the division in the ﬁnal week
of the season.

That leaves two wildcard spots
available, and I’m thinking the
Falcons are a sure-shot for one
of them. The last one will make
for the most interesting race in
the NFL’s ﬁnal week.

The Lions have crumbled in
big games, the Bears are banged
up and fading, and the Cowboys
are currently a division leader.
Against my better judgment, I’m
going to go with a hunch and pick
the Lions in this race —- but I don’t
think they’re going to make any
noise in the playoffs. I just think
it’s ﬁnally their time to return to
the postseason.

Unfortunately, I don’t see
things getting interesting from
there. I think the Packers will roll
to an NFC Championship, and use
NFL’s surprise team of the year -—
the San Francisco 49ers — will
meet them there. Unfortunately,
that game will be a slaughter and
the Packers will go on to take their
second straight NFL champion-
ship over the Patriots.

Score prediction? 31-21, Green
Bay. I _

Basketball 4 12

country, at almost 84 points per '
game.

Forward Stan Okoye and guard
Keith Gabriel each average about
17 points per game to lead the
Keydets’ potent and balanced at-
tack. Seven VMI players average
more than-ﬁve points per game.

But VMI’s defense, which has
conceded 100 or more points
already four times this season
-- including an incredible 114
points in a defeat at Charleston
Southern last Saturday — has
cost head coach Duggar Baucom’s
team dearly during its current
three-game losing streak.

“Defensively, it was absolutely

atrocious,” Baucom said of the
Charleston Southern game. “It
was a pitiful performance and
[there was] no excuse for it.”

If Pitt’s last two wins over
Duquesne and Tennessee, in
which the Panthers out-rebound-
ed their opponents by a combined
67 to 45 margin, are anything to
go by, the boards might be where
Jamie Dixon’s team can counter
VMI’s scoring threat.

“We ground it out, and that
was good to see,” Dixon said of
Pitt’s rebounding in the Tennes-
see game.

The Panthers’ depth in the
front-court has been apparent

in the last four games of the
team’s current ﬁve-game winning!
streak. In each game, a differ-
ent Panther big man recorded a
double-double. P

Khem Birch against Penn, Tal-
ib Zanna against Robert Morris,
Dante Taylor against Duquesng
and N asir Robinson against Ten-
nessee each recorded at least 10
points and 10 rebounds in their
respective high—scoring games.

And with VMI entering Tues-
day’s game as the 270“‘—best re-
bounding team in the natio‘r‘!‘;‘*
Pitt’s big men will have another
opportunity to win the battle in-
side the paint. i

In the consolations, Nauman won three

Nauman lost again to Habat, this time

beat Tyler. That’s something Tyler needs
to work on. He has to ﬁnd a way to beat

Tyler Wilps ﬁnished in eighth place at
165 pounds. The younger Wilps won two
bouts before a 3-2 loss to No. 4-ranked
Paul Gillespie of Hofstra dropped him into
the consolations. After a 3-1 victory over
Kyle Eason of West Virginia, Wilps lost by

_fall to No. 10 Robert Kokesh of Nebraska.

In the seventh—place bout, Wilpslost 4-2
to No. 17 Dan Yates of Michigan. Wilps
totaled three wins in the tournament in
his first season in the starting lineup for
the Panthers. --
Headlee entered the event ranked
No. 21 in the nation following his season
debut against Michigan. Headlee placed
seventh in the tournament after four wins.
He lost in the quarterﬁnals 3-2 to Ryan
DesRoches of Cal—Poly and dropped into
the consolations. Headlee lost again in the
consolations to land in the seventh—place
bout, where he won 7-0 over Kurtisjulson
from North Dakota State. -
Senior heavyweight Zac Thomusseit

after his stunning overtime win against

Wrestling League rival Edinboro ﬁnished
seventh as a team, one place ahead of Pitt.
Pitt defeated Michigan last week in a dual
meet and will get opportunities to match
up with Ohio State next week in a dual
meet and will see Edinboro in February.

“It really says something about our
schedule thisseason,” Kocher said. “We
wrestle atough schedule this year and
that will help us. It’s important to give us
a name by wrestling against the best. Our
goal is to be the best team that we can be,
and that requires us to wrestle the best
teams. Wrestling against these kinds of
teams will mean a lot to our guys at Na-
tionals [NCAA Championships], because
they will see these guys again.”

Pitt will match up with Ohio State, the
Cliff Keen Invitational team champions
on Friday night at the Fitzgerald Field
House at 7 p.m. ‘

“I’m conﬁdent in our guys,” Kocher

said. “We’re a strong dual—meet team be-
cause we have 10 good guys and can win
at every weight. Zac Thomusseit will be
back in the lineup for us, and that should
complete our team. We’re a better team
now than we were last week. Ohio State
is good also and they have some aces on
their team, but I think we can come out
on top.”
