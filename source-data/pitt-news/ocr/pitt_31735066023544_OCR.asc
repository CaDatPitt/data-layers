tegal Awareness
Officers Quit Jobs

B)’ MARY KANE
Pitt News Staff Writer

.The executive board of the
Legal Awareness Committee has
resigned because of various in-
ternal problems, according to
Student Government President
Bill Abraham.

Abraham said he received let-
ters of resignation from commit-
tee chairman Mary Curiale, co-
chairman Todd DeLuca,
secretary Linda Seguino, and
treasurer Michael Langer. The
officers, who were ‘elected

I January, ‘resigned at a commit-
tee meeting last week. The com-
mittee will hold another election
on March 5, and the resigned of-
_ficers are eligible to run again,
according to Abraham.

Former chairman Mary
Curiale said, she resigned
“because I felt I had to.”

’_‘There was a personality con-
flict between the officers, and a
lack of a clear definition“ of
roles,’’ Curiale said. “I’m sorry
this happened, because it imped-
ed the committee from progress-
ing.” .

Curiale added that she intends
to run again.

Michael Langer said the of-
_ficers resigned because. they
believed they couldn’t work with
each other, and that the com-
mittee wasn’t making progress.

“Why is a committee with 35 V
membersand a $9000 budget in- _
effective and not moving , on
programs?” he said. “We (the

All year long fraternities run pro-
grams to assist the community, such
as fund raisers for Children’s
Hospital and the Western-Penn-
sylvania School forthe Blind and
other charities. Greek Week,
however, serves as the most impor-
tant time period for charity fund
raising.

Last year during Greek Week,

.Pitt’s Fraternities’ and Sororities

joined together to raise over
$30,000 for the American Cancer
-Society. This year, the Greeks have
set a goal of $36,000 to donate to
the‘ American Heart Association.
The theme for Greek Week is “You
Gotta Have Heart.”

Greek Sing kicks-off Greek Week
Saturday, March 8th. Greek Sing
will be held in the Carnegie Music
Hall starting at 6:00 p.m., accor-
ding to Greek Sing co-chairperson
Barb George. Greek Sing consists
of the individual fraternities and
sororities doing a musical number.

officers) weren’t working
together, we workingapart. We

had problems in gettin‘g‘together
to work out our objectives.”

Langer added he is con-
templating running again. He
commented that it would be a
vote of confidence if the com-
mittee re-elected the resigned of-
ficers.

“If the committeeithinks we
can still do the job, then they’ll
put us back in office,” he said.

Linda Seguino stated that the
resignations were necessary to
restructure the executive board.

“All four of us had good
‘ideas, but we were going in four
different directions,” she said.

Seguino also said that she
believed committee’s’ . biggest
problem was that it wasn’t pro-
ductive enough. Seguino is un-
sure if she’ll run again or not. ,

Todd DeLuca explained that
he believed the officers resigned,’
so the committee could make a
choice of whether they still
wanted them or not. DeLuca
said he will be running again.

Student Government Board
member Al Mele, who acts as
-lliaison between the committee
and SGB, is ‘the interim chair-
man of the committee until the_

. election. ’

“All the officers were hard
working, but they couldn’t seem
to work well together,” he said.

— “I feel that Greek Sing is taken a‘

little more serious by the individual
groups this year because of the
auditions and the professional
judges. It makes the event a little
classy,” George added.

The next segment of Greek Week
is the 24-hour dance marathon. Ac-
cording to Patty Adair, co-
chairperson of Greek Week along
with Chris Marunak, the dance
marathon will be held in the Stu-

dent Union Ballroom and will begin '
‘at 8:00 p.m. on Friday March 14,

concluding at 8:00 p.m. on Satur-

Council Helps

By JOE BRANDT
Pitt News Staff Writer

Students who are bored with the
usual summer job routine now have
an opportunity to add something
new into their vacation time.

An organization called the Coun-
cil on International Educational Ex-
change (CIEE) is helping students
who wish to work overseas this
summer from being'- tangled in red
tape. Working in cooperation with
agencies in France, Great Britain,
Ireland, and New Zealand, the
CIEE acts as a channel through
which students can more easily be
processed by the governments and
organizations involved.

According to Beth Ketsoglou of
the CIEE, many students wishing to
go to Europe are often caught up in
rules and regulations, and
sometimes end up staying home.

 

“Many countries require students
to have a job lined up before issuing
working papers, but you can’t get a
job there without having the work
papers,” Ketsoglou said. “It’s kind
of a Catch-22.”

“What the CIEE does is issue
working papers, with the authoriza-
tion of the governments involved,
so that students are free to find jobs
in advance, often before they leave
the U.S.”

While the CIEE does not directly
find jobs for those using the pro-
gram, she adds that they do provide
information so that students can

find prospective employers more

easily. *

Students are responsible for their
own housing and transportation, in
addition to employment, but are
put in touch with various student

organizations in each country
through the CIEE.

According to Ketsoglou, the
CIEE has been assisting students

for ten years now, and last year‘

alone helped over 1600 people in
finding their way around. They are
also responsible for helping many
foreign students to come here, with
the permission of the U.S. govern-

ment.
A fee of $20 is charged for each

country, except for Ireland, which
will cost $40. Ketsoglou said the fee
is necessary because the CIEE is
financially responsible for the
students it brings into this country.
All students must be at least 18
years old, and able to prove their
student status‘ inorder to be eligible
for the program. Also, those who
wish to work in France must be able
to speak French. ‘

Although the plan may sound
complete and trouble free, one of-
ficial cautions students that the trip
might not turn out to be as great as
they might expect.

Tom Rush, of Pitt’s Student
Employment Office, says that many
students will be severely dis-
appointed in the jobs‘ they receive,
if they are able to find one at all,
and warns students to beware.

“Students from here will receive
the same types of jobs that you ex-
pect most foreign students to
receive here,” Rush said. “If you
can get one at all, the job will pro-
bably be along the lines of a
busboy, maid, orlsome other lower
level, low-‘paying employment.”

Rush doesn’t advise anybody
from attempting to go and work in‘
Europe just for the summer, poin-
ting out that by the time a job may

Students Secure Overseas Working Papers

arise, the summer may be over, ‘T5’

leaving the student both broke and
discouraged.

“Realistically, the idea just isn’t
very feasible,” he added.

Rush recommends, however, that
anybody who does decide to go to
Europe should look into Youth
Hostels and buying a Eurorail pass,
both of which should save a lot of
time and money, and just make
things generally easier.

“Both the railroad and hostel
systems are much more extensive in
Europe than in the United States;
and can really help you out.”

plications by writing the CIEE,

  What's On Your Police Record? For $10, Anyone Can Know

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG—Everyone has
seen a television cops-and-robbers
show where the tough detective
confronts a suspect with‘ his rap
sheet—a lurid list of past clashes
with the law.

Now your mother-in-law, your
employer or a neighbor can do pret-

A new state law makes individual
criminal records available to anyone
who wants to see them. All you
need is a person’s name, date of
birth and $10. The applications are
available at local‘ state police
substations.

The state police, who maintain a
central depository for such records,

ty much the same thing.

BlImple’s a new fast food restaurant, has appeared on the scene in
Oakland. It is located on Forbes Ave.

have already filled hundreds of such
requests, mostly from employers
wanting to check up on individuals
before hiring them.

- “This has far-reaching implica-
tions. It provides for landlords to
check on prospective tenants,” said
Capt. Warren L. Shaffer, director
of the state police records and iden-
tification division. '

Applications must state the pur-
pose for the inquiry, said Shaffer,
“but it can be anything. You can
put down ‘just nose_y’.”

The new procedure is required by
the Criminal History Record Infor-
mation Act of 1978, which took ef-
fect last Jan. 1.

Previously, .local policement
could obtain rap sheets from the
state. police, and there was nothing
in state law to prevent them from
passing on the information to
anyone. Although many police
departments had policies against

~ such disclosures, it was common for

news reporters to get a,-look at an
individual’s rap sheet, listing all
past arrests including those not
resulting in convictions.

The new law continues to allow
the state police to provide full rap
sheets, including all arrests, to local
police and other law enforcement
agencies."

“But non-criminal agencies or in-
dividuals will just get convictions or
current information on arrests that
are still before the courts,” said
Shaffer.

County courthouse docket
sheets, however, are not "affected by
the new law. / They are still open to
the public and show all an in-
dividua1’s arrests, but only in the
local county.

The state’s centralized criminal
records center at state police head-
quarters in Harrisburg has files on
1,365,000 people. Even records on
those long dead must be maintain-
ed. The center is a vast reservoir of
paper, with people classified.\by
name or by their fingerprints.

Shaffer said he will need more
than 30 new employees just to han-
dle the added paperwork created by
the new law. Twenty clerks have
already been hired.’ -

One of them was at work the A
other day on a stack of application?’
from the Gregg Security Co.

Gregg is the company that pro-
vides guards for Three Mile Island,
and was recently embarrassed
because a young reporter got a
job—-and access to the nuclear
power plant’s innards——by using
bogus background identification.

There is a $10 fee for each in-
dividual record sought, even if the
state police find the person has no
record at all.

Some government agencies, Sufi“.
as the Liquor Control Board, have
free access. Others, such as the
Horse Racing Commission, must
come up with the $10 fee per ap-
plication. To find a record, Shaf-
fer’s people need a full name and
date of birth, or a full set of 10
fingerprints.

Contrary to television and movie
myths, police and the FBI cannot
locate the file of a suspect when
supplied with only one or a few
fingerprints. They must have all 10'.

State Weather: Snowy And Frigid

Nefherlonds'l'V Wary Of Competition

By the Associated Press
3, AMSTERDAM,—For more than
‘a decade now, the Netherlands has
nurtured a unique broadcasting
system where independent, non-
profit organizations split up
available air time according to the
number of members they enroll.

It has worked well, its supporters
believe, and in the best Dutch tradi-
tion allows expression to minority
and other groups, without their be-
ing submerged in a broad commer-
cial system.

Now, many Dutchmen see their
system under threat, from- abroad.
“This threat, as the government,
 national broadcasting organiza-
tion NOS, and Parliament see it,
comes from the ‘Luxembourg Rtl,
which has long-range plans to
transmit programs to Holland—in
Dutch.

Deltakabel, a private Dutch cable

television company, is negotiating
with Rtl to pick up the signal from
Luxembourg in Sluis in the south of
the country, and re-transmit it on
the national cable network. _

This, the detractors say, would
draw ‘viewers and advertising away
from local broadcasting and force it
to compete with Rtl.

.“That would be a waste of
money and energy, with results that

will seldom be known for ex-
cellence,”, said one leading
newspaper. ~

Spurred by developing anxiety in
Parliament, the Ministry of Culture
has ordered a comprehensive
review of the Dutch broadcasting
system by Oct. 1. The review will
look at the Dutch system, the
perceived threat to it by Dutch pro-
grams originating outside the coun-

try, and the desirability, or other-
wise, of introducing a fully com-
mercial system.

In the Dutch system, there are
eight independent organizations
which are alloted 80 percent of
radio transmission time over fou-r
networks, and two-thirds of
television time over two networks.

‘ The remaining air time is given to
NOS, which wovides studio"
facilities, transmission networks,
news programs and coverage of big
events such as the Olympic Games.

The independent organizations
representing a range of ideological
principles and religions are granted
air time according to the number of
paid-up members. The usual way
to becomea member is to subscribe
to an organization’s weekly pro-
gram publication.

  Avoiding
Roadblocks

The entire executive board of the_Student Govern-
ment Board’s Legal Awareness Committee resigned
last Thursday due to what SGB president Bill
Abraham termed “internal difficulties.” ’

Mary Curiale, co-chairman of the committee said
she was obligated to resign in light of the personality
conflicts between the officers, along with a lack of
clear definition or roles of the officers.

Other committee officers echoed the sentiments of
Curiale adding that these internal problem were the
greatest hinderance to the committee’s effectiveness.

Over the past years, the Legal Awareness Commit-
tee has provided an invaluable service to students,
aiding them with landlord-tenant problems, inter-
preting the legal garble found in many apartment
leases, and
themselves faced with other legal difficulties. Up un-
til very recently the committee was effective in im-
plementing its “students helping students”
philosophy.

Despite the difficulties that prompted the mass
resignation, all of the former officers said they intend
to run for re-election in the March 5 election.

It seems unlikely that time will heal the wounds in-
ﬂicted Legal Awareness effectiveness and credibility

representing students who found

making it almost nonsensical for the same officers to

assume the same positions only to be forced into '
dealing with the same old problems.

Surely if -the governing body of the Legal
Awareness Committee is striving for excellence it
would seem only logical that its members would seek
to a void the same roadblocks that prompted last
weeks’ resignations.‘ ’ ‘

There are several solutions to the problems en-
countered by the committee.

One solution involves recruitment ‘of “fresh
blood”, members not involved in the personal con-
flicts to serve as members of the executive council.
This may be a difficult task in light of the closeness
and frequent internal political games that are played
within student organizations.

Another solution, although rather idealistic, might
be for the members of the committee to put their per-
sonal feelings aside, maintaining some air of profes-
sionalism about the workings of the office while con-
tinuing to provide legal advice to Pitt students.

It is imperative that the Legal Awareness Commit-
tee seek one of these solutions to remedy its marginal

existence, so that some. justice might be done to the ‘F

general student population that pays dearly for the
mere existence of the committee.

Pitt did offer enough bureaucratic

ed into the “real” world.

Thereal world for me today is, of
all places, Charleston, W. Va.,
known for the Kanawha River, the

Charleston Charlies and head-

quarters for the state's well inten-
tioned but sometimes inept
legislators.

On the very first day of this
year’s session, one delegate offered
legislation demanding the return of

. Lawrence Welk’s cancelled show to

a northern television station. Poor
man. He should have taken a
lesson from Pitt's chancellor in the
art of tact.

For instance, in response’ to Gov.

Dick Thornburgh’s proposed state
allocation for Pitt, Wes didn’t lose
his touch for going right around the
point in this quote from the Feb. 11
edition of The Pitt News:

“While the increase is modest, we
are gratiﬁed that- in a year in which

.the commonwealth faces continued
‘financial constraints, Gov.- Thorn-

burgh (has given high priority to
higher education and has been
responsive to our request for equity
in the allocation of available‘
funds.” 3 . _ _ ' .
What did he say? Does‘ we
know?~.  _

V WE’.

 

How about this statement, from
one of Posvar’s right-hand men,
Conney Kimbo, vice chancellor for
student affairs, on the university's
new dorm policy?

“To change a policy is not all

violation of your rights as long as

‘ it’s changed at the end of the year.”

Or how about this Kimbo state-
ment concerning the century-long
question of replacing WPGH Radio
with amodern facility and an"FM
frequency? ,

“If the proposal is rejected, and
that’s a possibility, it is because
there are no available dollars to
fund it.” A _

But there were apparently enough

. dollars» in Senior Vice Chancellor

Jack Freeman’s budget to send the

chancellor to Peking a couple of,

years ago. ' Where was Freeman
when the band needed funds to_ go
to the Fiesta Bowl last year? Didn't
these band members pay tuition last
year? Will they pay more tuition
dollars this year? Only Freeman
and Posvar know the answer. And

‘that answer, although they will

regret it, will undoubtedly - be

Youth Missing For Seven Years.

Found Walking Along Street’  

By The Associated Press

UKIAH, Calif.—A 14-year-old
boy who was kidnapped from his
family more than seven years ago

was discovered -walking on a street .

early Sunday. His mother called
the news “phenomenal”. and said
the family had never given up hope

he would be found. -

The teen"-ager, who knew his
name and hometown, was positive-
ly identified as Steven Stayner of
Merced, a town about 200 miles‘
southeast of Ukiah. He was found
in the company of a 5-year-old boy,
who was identified as a more recent
kidnap victim, police said.

Authorities said Kenneth Eugene

Parnell, 48, of nearby Fort Bragg,‘

was arrested_ at the Ukiah hotel
where he worked and booked for
investigation of kidnapping the
younger victim, Timothy Lee White

of Ukiah. Parnell was being held in .

lieu of $7,000 bail.

Ukiah Sgt. Glen Bell said Merced
detectives were taking Stayner back
home.

“It’s a really touchy situation,”
said Bell, “to call. someone’s
parents to tell them a kid they gave
up for dead seven years , ago is
alive.” I

Stayner, one of five children of

Delbert and Kay Stayner, had

disappeared on Dec. 4,1972, while
walking home from school.

“We expected him to come
back,” his mother told a reporter
who reached her by telephone. We
thought that as soon he was old
enough to get out, that he would.

. “We had hope, faith and kept
busy,” she said. “I know that
sounds very oversimpliﬁed, but in a
situation like that, you carry on,
you don’t fall apart, at least you try
not to.” . ._

The mother "said the family and
friends were gathering for Steven's
return. She said she had not yet
talked to her son.

Asked why the teen-ager had not
returned home although he ap-
parently had the opportunity to do
so, .Bell speculated, ‘_‘Someone’s
.-nice to you for a couple of years,
you don’t ' want to .hurt them,
maybe. I don’t know for sure. All
I know is that he didn’t get away.”

Timothy, who had last been seen‘
Feb. 14 walking from school to his
babysitter’s house, was spotted
about midnight by police officer
Bob Warner, who recognized him
even though his hair had been dyed
and cut.

Police Chief David Johnson said
Warner chased the boy, who ran up

to a teen-age companion. The two
boys were taken to police head-
quarters, where the 14-year-old

revealed his identity during ques-

tioning.

The two boys said they had hitch-
hiked to Ukiah from Fort Bragg,
about 25 miles to the northwest.

Timothy was examined at Ukiah
General Hospital and released in his
parents’ custody. ’

MOSCOW—The official .Soviet

Soviet ﬂying saucer enthusiasts, in-
sisting that no scientific evidence
has confirmed purported sightings
of interplanetary visitors or their

The Communist Party newspaper
Pravda devoted nearly a half-page

“special research volumes”—
presumably in secret—-about UFOs.
The paper called that report

But much of the limelight Satur-

The Russian boars were dis-

The Pantherette basketball team
could not play the biblical role of
Daniel Friday night, and emerge
from the lion’s den unscathed. Pitt
invaded Rec Hall at University Park
to challenge Penn.State in the first
round of the EAIAW Middle-
Atlantic championships. The Lady

Lions proceeded to maul the Pan-
therettes, 89-61.

Penn State center Mary Donovan
and freshman guard Corinne Gulas
led the Lady Lions to a 39-25
halftime edge. The lead exchanged
hands several times, ‘but Pitt held a
slight 8-7 margin after the first four
minutes. Then, the Pantherettes’
shooting hands turned to ice, and

Penn State caught fire. _
Corinne Gulas pumped in eight
points and passed off for another
six as the Lady Lions built a 23-14
lead with 6:37 remaining in the half.
Pitt then struck back with seven
quick points, five of them by Pam
I Miklasevich. Penn State held just a
four point edge, 25-21, with five
minutes left; a disasterous five

minutes. - '

The Pantherettes managed only
four points, all via free throws.
Meanwhile, Chris Gulas took over
the scoring chores for her sister,
pumping in six points. Penn State
took a 39-25 lead into the locker
room at the half.

‘At the halfway mark, Pitt had hit

only 9 of their 23 shots from the

field, and Mary Donovan almost
outrebounded the entire Pan-
therette squad. Donovan had 10 re-
bounds in the first half, and Pitt
had 15. _ 9
According to Pantherette coach
Jean Balthaser, the key to the first
half, and to the game, were the free
throws. The Pantherettes shot way

Shortly before presstime, the Pitt
News learned that the Panthers had
been asked to participate in the Na-
tional Invitational Tournament
(NIT). As had already been sug-
gested in this article, Pitt will indeed
face Duquesne Thursday in the
opening round at the Civic Arena.
Penn State was also invited, and
will play Alabama Wednesday.

For the Pitt basketball Panthers,
the dirtiest four-letter F-Word in

'the book is spelled f—o-u-l. At least

such was the case Friday night as
the NCAA hopeful Panthers were
ousted from the Eastern Eight tour-
nament by Villanova, 72-59.

First, there was freshman center
Paul Brozovich picking up his third
personal foul almost before the
crowd of 16,172 had settled back in-
to the patched-up red Civic Arena
seats. Brozovich fouled out less
than four minutes into the second
half and was joined by teammate
Sammie Ellis eight’ minutes later.

» The pair was greeted by Pitt’s Dave

Olinger, who was restricted to the
bench for the second half after a
tete-a-tete with Wildcat center Mar-

' ty Caron.

“The big difference was playing
without Ellis and Dave Olinger,”
said Panther coach Tim Grgurich.
“You can’t shoot the ball with them
on the bench.”

For a while it seemed as if Pitt
couldn’t shoot the ball anyway, as
the Panthers missed an‘amazing
number of layups, uncontested
dunks and in some cases, fast
breaks ended before a shot could
even be taken.

Clearly, this was not the same
team that beat Villanova at the

"Field House a scant nine days

earlier.

Without the regular big men in-
side, the Panthers conceded shots
to Villanova. The Pitt defense
however, was perhaps as fine as its
offense was unproductive. That is,
it was fine, when there were enough
regulars in the game to run it pro-
perly, although its execution
resulted in 24 Wildcat turnovers.

“We played without our usual
guys on defense,” said Grgurich,

“and it’s tough to adjust in the last

game of the season after you’ve

done it differently all season.”
Except for having an unusual

amount of foul trouble at the‘

outset, Pitt started the contest in
much the same fashion as they had
since the beginning of February.
The Panthers fell behind. Then,‘
they came back.’ Then they were
down at the half by seven points.
They closed to within six until mid-
way through the second half. It was
then time for one last surge, but Pitt
reached back and came up empty.
Before Friday’s game, guard
Carlton Neverson declared himself
ready to meet the Wildcat challenge

Sports    

hers, Dkes Clash Agoinin NIT   

and proved it later that evening by
scoring a game-high 21 points and
keeping the team within striking
distance throughout.

Despite Neverson’s 50 percent ac-
curacy in both field goal (10-20) and
free throw shooting (1-_2), Pitt as a
team shot a poor 34 percent and 56
percent. The Wildcats owed
much of their success to their own
percentages of 57 percent and 68
percent_. This, plus a 46-33 reboun-
ding edge was enough to send
Villanova into the Eastern Eight
final where it eventually emerged
with an NCAA tournament berth
by knocking off West Virginia
University, 74-62.

Sam Clancy looks for open shot against ViIlanova’s John Pinone and Aaron Howard.

So where does this leave the 17-11
Panthers? Pitt is in the same boat
as Duquesne, who lost in the BAA
opening round but still finished

. with a sound 17-9 record. National

Invitation Tournament (NIT) bids
will soon be issued and including
both Pittsburgh teams in the field
could be a definite asset to the "NIT.

For two reasons, a rematch of
Pitt and Duquesne in the opening
round of the NIT would be an ex-
cellent idea. First, the game would
almost certainly be well-attended,
which means financial success. Se-
cond, it would be a rubber match
between the schools, which split
during the regular season. The

Blais photo

stakes would be advancement in the
tournament, which would add even
more incentive to an already emo-

tional game. It would decide once
and for all collegiate basketball

champ in

Champions.” _
Such a natural rivalry brings out

the bestiin both teams. For the

‘the “City of

‘Panthers, it would also go a long

way toward erasing some _“foul”
memories.

FREE THROWS: Villanova is‘
the only repeat winner of the_EAA,
tournament in the league’s four-
year history, other winners were
Duquesne (1977) and Rutgers
(1979). '

The Pantherette gymnastics
team headed west. or rather
midwest to Ohio State Saturday
and lost a dual meet to the
Buckeyes, 134.95-130.15.

“That score didn’t help our
season average,” said coach
Donna Sanft, “but I feel good
because it was the second meet
in a row that we hit all our bar
routines.” A

In the uneven bars, three Pan-
therettes had good routines, .ac- ,
C0Idiflg I9 Sanft.‘ Roxanne

Evans won the event with an
8.85. In addition, Babble Flock
performed well with only one
break.

Sanft was unhappy with the
scores received in the vaulting.
Ohio State’s Donna Silver won
the event, performing a full
twist on, handspring off vault
and scoring a 9.1.

“For some reason, Holly
(Martino), , Gretchen (Speich) _
and ‘Roxanne weren’t scoring‘
well,” said Sanft. “They were

‘all doing-the-same vault and‘

theirscores should hav_e been

higher.”

At this point of the meet,
after two eventsfthe Pantheret-
tes were behind by only six-
tenths of a point.

The balance beam was the
next event, Pitt’s downfall for
the day.

“We just fell all over the
place,” said\Sanft. “They beat
us by four points and it turned
out to be the story of the meet.”

Bonnie T ressler had the high

9 , score for Pitt, as she was the on-'

ly"Pantherette to stay on the
beam. She h,ad_a,_n.8.4.' State’s

Unbalanced Pitt Gymnasts Fall arr Beam inLosstoBucks  

Carol Cardaci won the event
with a 9.0.

The final event, the floor ex-
ercise was even, Sanft said as I _
Ohio State outscored Pitt by_on-
ly one-tenth of a point. Buckeye
Silver won the event with an 8.6’
while Pitt’s Evans was second
with an 8.5.

In the all around, Martino
was the high scorer for Pitt with
a 33.10 which placed her third
behind Silver and her teammate
Cindy Draper. " _I_ , _ ‘ 

".“Holly "did real well,"’  1‘

«Virginia.  “ '

Sanft. “In fact, in her floor
’ routine she added some new
moves, ‘including a fulltwist at
the beginning and at the end. of
her routine. She workeda con-
sistent meet despite being hurt.”

The Pantherettes are off until
March 20, when they will com-
pete in Eastern Regionals at
Penn State. Seedings for
regionals will be announced one
week from today.‘ Sanft said she
expects Pitt to be seeded third-,

For the Pitt basketball team, it’s
wait till next year. For West
Virginia, Cinderella’s carriage
became a pumpkin. For the
Villanova Wildcats,‘ they became
the first team to win two Eastern
Eight championships, beating the

— Mountaineers 74-62 Saturday night

at the Civic Arena.

Villanova proved it is the best
team in the league, maintaining its
poise and freshness throughout the
72-59 semi-ﬁnal win over the Pan-
thers, and the title contest over
West Virginia. Pitt proved you can
only go so far without outside
shooters and bench strength, while
the Mountaineers seem to have
found a “home away from home,”
the Arena, which had 29,000 fans,
many from West Virginia, pass the
turnstiles for the two night event.

thousands of Mountaineers in the
crowd began chanting “We Want
Pitt,” having assumed a Pitt con-
quest of Villanova in the second
game. But such chanting was
nothing more than wishful think-
ing. The Panthers took the cold
Arena floor wearing T-shirts under
their uniforms, failed to score until
the game was four minutes old, and
gave little indication that this year’s
semi-final with the Wildcats would
be as successful as last year’s.
With only Carlton Neverson able
to find the hoop, the Pitt offensive
attack was shaky at best. Sammie

Ellis got into foul trouble early, and .

saw his career in a Pitt uniform
come to an end by scoring only five

-points in 17' minutes.

Shortly thereafter, Dave Olinger
got mixed up with 6-foot-10 Marty
Caron, which resulted in the ejec-
tion of the junior from Fresno,
Ohio, generally» regarded as Pitt’s
outside shooting attack.

All the fussing and fighting did
was hurt Pitt as technical fouls were
called and Tom Sienkiewicz, who

_could «probably swish foul shots
handcuffed and blindfolded, con-’

verted giving Villanova a 33-26 lead
at intermission. ' .

The second half had" Pitt get as
‘close as five points, 53-48, but any
time a team shoots 34 percent from
the floor and misses more layups
than a dog has fleas, it isn’t going to
win. The‘72-59 defeat was. a’ bitter
end to a season which had the Pan-
thers win 12 of their first 15 games,
then lose eight of their last 13.

Neverson led Pitt with 21 points
and Sam Clancy pulled down 14 re-
bounds. '

In Saturday’s title game,
Villanova scored the game’s first
four points and led the entire game.
The inside strength of Alex Bradley

_(24 -points), John Pinone and Aaron

Howard was a bit too much for the
guard dominated WVU attack of
Lowes Moore, (22 points and tour-
nament MVP) and Joe Fryz (16
points).

Al Adehnann and a superb goal
stopping display by keeper Scott

, I Thunberg, the Panther indoor soc-

cer squad placed second in the first
annual Carnegie , Mellon indoor
The tournament,

sburgh Collegiate circles, was under
Pitt
goalkeeper and now head coach of
CMU, Gene Klein.

The Panthers recorded five wins
in the six game round robin

' - preliminaries. The only loss came

to West Virginia Wesleyan in a 1-0
game. Pitt went on to take a second
place in Division II which entitled
them to meet the Division I winner
Case Western Reserve in a semifinal
match that found Pitt on top by a
1-0 score. The goal came with only
a minute elapsed in the game when
freshman forward Troy Norton
quickly put one past a stunned
CWR goalkeeper.

The Panther defense held off

I CWR for the remainder of the game

and secured the 1-0 win putting the
Panthers into the tournament
finalS.‘

Pitt once again faced West

Virginia Wesleyan in the finale.

Falling to a 3-0 defeat, the Panthers
settled for second place.

'.\.

‘;

Pitt’s first victory came over Mt.
Union College, headed by another
ex-Panther Joe Luxbacher. Pitt
goals came from freshman Tom
Trempus, his first with the Pan-
thers, Al Adelmann and Danny
Hamm. The Mt. Union score was
to be only one of two that
Thunberg was to see pass him in the
round "robin preliminaries.
Thunberg finished the day with the
best goals against average of the
tournament, that came in competi-
tion with fourteen other
goalkeepers.

The next Panther victory came
over Grove City, a team who had
handed the Panthers one of their
nine defeats in a dismal outdoor
season last fall. In this matchup
John Pizzella put in his first goal of
the day and Adelmann added
another.

After the 1-0 round robin loss to
West Virginia Wesleyan the Pan-
thers got on their feet again and
recorded three straight victories to
place them second- in Division II.
Wins were 3-0 over Behrend Col-
lege, 6-0 over Alderson-Broaddus, a
tough West Virginia College, 4-0
over a CMU freshman squad and
Bob Hughes recorded his first of
five goals in the three games series
in the Behrend victory. Pizzella and
Adelmann contributed also.

. and the profit

In the 6-0 thrashing of A&B Nor-
ton, Hughes, Jerry Buirge, and
Adelmann scored with Pizzella ad-
ding two more.

Against CMU, Hughes was the
two goal scorer with Hamm and
Trempus adding their second of the
day.

The Panthers showed themselves

to be a very well distributed team as
every member of the team (an in-

door team consists of eight ﬁeld
players and a goalie) scored except

for freshman Eric Tiedtke, who has I

been hampered with a foot injury.

“After losing to West Virginia we
got, right back up with that 3-0 win
over Behrend,” said Hughes.
“After that we all saw playoffs in

our eyes. Then when we had back-

really fired up.”

really performed great out there. I
was very impressed with the team,
everyone that was in the game, no
matter who it was, was playing well
together.”

Pitt’s next tournament will take
place next weekend when the Pan-
thers travel to Grove City on Satur-
day.

everything else. But we missed
them, and we were forced to gamble
in the second half to try to catch
up.” '
