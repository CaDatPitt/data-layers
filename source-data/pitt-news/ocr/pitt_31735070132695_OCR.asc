VOLUME XCVIII, NUMBER 135

Pick-a-

Prof up
at Pitt

KATIE LEONARD
Assistant News Editor

It’s been a long time coming — but
it’s ﬁnally here. ' A '

Past Student Government Boards
have talked about bringing an online pro-
fessor evaluation site to Pitt students, and

this week it has ﬁnally come to fruition. _
' After campaigning on this issue,

Board member Joe Pasqualichio has
worked out a year-long, free —— exclud-
ing a $200 one-time joining fee, paid by
SGB — trial of Pick-a-Prof for Pitt’s
campus.

But just because the site is up now,
doesn’t make it a success —yet.

- “Most important is a lot of students
use it,” Pasqualichio said. At -some
schools about 80 percent of the student »
body uses the site. The more students that
use it, the more value it serves in provid-
ing a wide range of opinions for students
to base their own evaluations on, he
added. _

The site allows students to ﬁll out a
questionnaire about the professor’s teach-
ing style, including such information as_
the importance of attending lecture,
whether ‘or not the grading is done fairly
and the size of the workload. It also pro-

vides a place to write about the teacher — _

reviews are read by the site’s managers
before being posted for profanity and Vul-
garity — and for students to give a bit of
personal information. about themselves
such as their overall QPA and the grade
the student expects in the class. That
information helps students evaluate the
critique — even though there is no way to
prove that the answers given are honest. ~-
' This site, unlike some other sites,
also allows professors to provide their

If research papers, projects and

ﬁnal exams are causing stress, and
going to the library seems less than
appealing, there is finally a solution.

The University Library System
has developed a way to solve this
common problem, with a new service
called HelpHub. _

The HelpHubs will be located in
three popular areas throughout cam-
pus, so as to be as easily accessible to
students as possible. Each area will be
open on a different day, between 6 and
9 p.m.

One will be located in the Petersen
Events Center food court and will be

open on Mondays through April 12.. ‘

Another will be open on the second

ﬂoor of Posvar Hall each Tuesday

through April 13. And the third one
will be in the Cathedral of Learning’s

Hubs of help on campus

-common area each Wednesday from
tomorrow until April 14.
P Librarians will be available at
each location with laptops to access
the wireless networks in the buildings
in which they are located. Each
HelpHub will be digitally linked, to
make gaining-access to library infor-
mation quick and easy.

HelpHubs will allow the conven-
tional way of doing research to be
taken out of the library and brought to

. the students in a more painless man-

ner. They will also allow students to
brush up on their information-seeking

- and evaluation skills.

According to Marian Hampton, a
library employee, “HelpHub person-
nel will be ready to assist students
with library questions, research
assignments, accessing library
resources and ﬁnding the’ information

E—Week’s 50th
anniversary

BRENDA MILLER
Staff Writer

Students whipped pies at professors,
guzzled cups full of cottage cheese, and
duct taped each other to walls outside
Benedum Hall last week, allin a celebra-
tion of engineering.

This year marked Pitt’s 50th
Anniversary of E-Week, participation.
The National Society of A Professional
Engineers established‘ the festivity to

bring recognition and awareness to the

engineering profession.

“Everyone knows what a doctor
does, or what a lawyer does, and we
want people to know what engineers
do,” said Nathan Phillips, president of
the Engineering Student Council. “We
are surrounded by buildings, cars,
engines —— things that engineers have
had a hand in.” . .

National Engineers Week was held
from Feb. 22 to 28 this year, but because
of midterms and Spring Break, Pitt
decided to push E-Week festivities back
a few weeks. According to Phillips, they
try to schedule ,E-Week around St.
Patrick’s Day, after they learned that he
was the patron saint of engineering. .

Planning for the week’s events actu-
ally begins at the start of the fall semes-
ter, when the ESC Executive Board

selects the E-Week Chairs. These two‘

students, with some help,'are responsible
for rule regulations, overseeing events,
scheduling and more. A

This year, Jane Haven and Chri
Wﬂson, who both admitted that things
get hectic, embraced thechallenges.

“We don't get much sleep,” said
Wilson, who described the challenge of
balancing the responsibilities.

This year’s 21 competitions included
traditional events, such as “Pittopoly”
and a Soap Box Derby, as well as new
events, like a Texas Hold .‘Em poker
tournament titled “Benedum Hold ‘Em.”
Phillips, a civil engineer competitor, said
that the game was "intense, but still enter-

THE PITT NEWS

Students try to escape
into Chinese culture

1  NICK $13 LWTZ

,=-_ 

The event; 'wasf~ :_'c“a1led “Escape
into a night §)‘f*Chi11'ese culture,” and
many students ifescaped into the
William Pitt Union Ballroom for an
evening of Chinese games and music.

The Pitt group Chinese—American
Students Association and Carnegie
Mellon University’s Asian Student
Association gathered together on
Saturday for a celebration of Chinese
culture.

“They were originally going to
call it game night,” said freshman Ted
Wysor.

And that may have been more
appropriate, since most of the
evening was dedicated to playing tra-
ditional and non—traditional Chinese
games.

Chinese yo—yos, known as diablos
in Western culture, ﬂew high into the

air as experienced yo—yoers showed
confused onlookers how to operate
the spinning dumbbell-like toy. The
object is to get the dumbbell spinning
faster and faster by manipulating two
sticks tied together with a thin string.

Instructors were also on—hand to
demonstrate calligraphy, sushi rolling
and mah—jongg — a traditional
Chinese tile game.

Karaoke and dancing also added
to the excitement of the night.

A Video game tournament, during
which students tested their skills at
Halo for prizes, topped off the night.
Several large projection screens and
many TV’s on carts were set up for
video game use as students competed
for gift certificates.

“We are just informing people. of
Chinese culture, and raising a little
money because we want to do bigger
and better stuff next year,” said Alan
Lee, a senior and president of CASA.

own information, whether it is personal or
information explaining -their" teaching
style depends upon the individual. .

Questions for the questionnaire are
customized according to each school. For
Pitt’s set of questions, Pasqualichio and
others asked students what questions they
would like to see included. And with the
help of SGB’s Academic Affairs
Committee, a set of questions was assem-
bled and put onto the site.

This project — unlike many of
SGB’s other projects — provides some-
thing tangible for students to see and use
regularly, according to Pasqualichio.

As to why this Board, unlike others,
has succeeded with this project, he said,
“There was an attitude of we’re going to
do it this time.”

If students use the site and it proves
to be of value, SGB would use money
from the Student Activities'Fee to ftmd its
continuance. Some sites, according to
Pasqualichio, cost about $4,000 armually

A to run; however, there is a chance that the

site would become free for universities to
access if it begins to use advertising.

Pasqualichio expects that the use of
the site may be a bit slow at first because
ﬁnal—exarn time is nearing, but after ﬁnals
he hopes the usage rate will increase.

By using an outside site rather than a
site run by SGB, which was proposed ear-
lier on, SGB does not have to worry about
legal issues that may arise with the evalu-
ations because Pick—a—Prof already has its
own set of lawyers. '

Pasqualichio intends to send a letter
to faculty members regarding the new
site, and how they can use it to inform
students and to explain that this site is not
meant to act as a place to just bash pro-
fessors.

An information session for students
may also take place in the fall to teach -stu-
dents about the beneﬁts of the site, but the
most important form of . publicity the
Board is using is word of mouth.

The site can be accessed at
www.pickaprof.com.

Material science engineers win

E-Week, page 1

In fact, many of the events were
intense. During an Olympic game of tug-
of-war, the civil engineers dragged their
opponents through the rain-soaked,
muddy Cathedral lawn.

“It’s a lot of fun, and everyone wants
to win,” Haven said. ‘

But it’s not all fun and games. The
first event, E-Day, was held on Thursday,
March 18, at- Frick International
Academy, across Fifth Avenue from
Towers. There, engineers educated the
eighth-graders about each department, as
part of a community outreach program.
This year the mechanical engineers
showed off a Formula One car, the chem-
ical engineers made “Gak, ” and the civil
engineers displayed a steel bridge. The
Frick students judged this competition.

The ﬁnal events entailed building

ﬂoats overnight and parading them
through Oakland, while performing skits
to be judged by faculty members.

The Shamrock Ball, hosted at the
Sheraton Station Square Hotel, capped
off the week-long extravaganza with tro-
phies handed out to the three highest-
scoring teams

First prize went to the materials sci-
ence engineers/engineering physics
team. Not bad for the department with
roughly 70 students enrolled, making it
the smallest of the eight engineering
departments. The industrial engineers
took second place, with electrical engi-
neering/computer engineering not far
behind in third.

Next year, two new chair people will

~ be selected and the process will begin all

over again, but for now, the MSE depart-
ment will bask in victory as this year’s E-
Week champions. V

they need.”

Although Harvard University has
a program similar to HelpHub, Pitt is
the ﬁrst school in the area to try it out.

Hampton said, “I would think that
some- other libraries are trying some-
thing like HelpHub given the growth
of wireless networks.”

' ‘ ' ' Sophomore Dennis Havriii‘ak"s'aid,' “

“I think this is a great idea, because
sometimes it is inconvenient to make
it to the library, and this will make
doing research much easier.”

. If the HelpHubs seem to be popu-
lar with students, more could show up
throughout campus next year.

student response, the HelpHub pro-
gram will grow and expand to other

Times have changed, so should laws .
. r&iL9amvB*-5 I-*1 M s .

A 15-year-old girl in Latrobe, Pa.
is being charged with possession of
child pornography, dissemination of
child pornography and sexual abuse
of children.

The child in question? It’s her.

The girl, whose identity is being
withheld by police, took sexually
explicit photographs of herself and
sent them to people she met online in
chat rooms, and now she’s facing
charges for her actions.

Without a doubt, she is on the
wrong side of the law, and has cer-
tainly disseminated and possessed
child porn. However, charging her
with these crimes is addressing the
wrong end of the equation. ‘

The law has a vested interest in
protecting her, in this case from her-
self, as well as from the potentially
creepy folks to whom she sent the
pictures. She should be held account-
able for her actions, but not in this
way.

Her punishment should be differ-

ent from others that would be charged ,

for these crimes, even though, literal-
ly, she did commit them. The laws she
violated are intended more for those
that would view. her photos, and not
for her. The girl, possessing porno-
graphic images ofjher own body is not
same as a 45-year-old man in posses-
sion of the very same shots.

The laws need to change to reflect
changing times. No one writing child.-
pornography laws could have forseen
the immense power and potential for
abuse that the Internet provides. It’s
up for debate if teens today are more
sexually active than they were in gen-
erations past, but, without a doubt,
there are more venues for themto be‘
visibly sexual. As such, new legisla-
tion should be enacted to separate
children like her from their abusers.

This is, of course, a very sad case
for the girl. Not only is she in trouble
with the law at a young age, but she
also has the added stigma of being
charged with one of society’s most
despicable crimes, when clearly it’s
guidance she needs.

A reasonable first reaction is to
wonder where her parents were, but
on second look, it makes less sense.
Before the Internet, a simple, “No
boys upstairs” rule could be enforced
in the home and could prevent too
much hanky-panky. Now, with stag-
gering technology available to just
about anyone, it’s harder for parents
to keep such a leash on kids, especial-
ly olderkids raised on the Internet.

Clearly, the teen needs to have
some sanctions imposed against her
—— just not the same ones as the

creeps who are benefiting from her

actions.

The FCC is treading too close to the Constitution

If it weren’t for Howard Stern, I

' might not "know what a “blumpkin” is. If

it weren’t for Oprah Winfrey, I deﬁnite-
ly wouldn’t know what a “tossed salad”
is. And ‘if it weren’t for the Federal
Communications Commission, I would-
n’t care about either. But with the grow-

ing momentum ‘behind the Broadcast.

Decency Enforcement Act of 2004, all
parties have suddenly become relevant.
The government has set its election-year
sights on indecency, and prepares to ﬁre
— doing so while dangerously close to
the Constitution. A q
A few weeks ago, the FCC ﬁned
Howard Stern $27,500 for a July 26,
2001 broadcast, in which he deﬁned sev-

eral slang terms for sexual acts. Among

these were “blumpkin,” “balloon knot,”
and “David Copperfield.” Shortly after
Stem’s fine was made public‘, Jimmy
Kimmel responded on his late night

_ show, “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”

“It’s all nonsense,” Kimmel said.
“It’s all a knee—jerk reaction to Janet
Jackson pulling her shirt open at the
Super Bowl. They go after ‘stuff they
don’t even listen to and they don’t even
watch to make people who write letters
happy, but do they go after the ﬁlthiest
broadcaster in American television? No.
Untouchable. They leave her alone. And
of course I’m talking about Opr .”

Kimmel went on to play a clip from

. from the two shows seemed

The Oprah Winfrey Show in which
Winfrey and a guest discuss
sexual slang including terms
such as “tossed salad” and
“rainbow party.” The content

remarkably similar, prompt-
ing Stern to play the same
Winfrey clip on his show the
following morning, meeting
resistance from his ﬁne—shy

 

energized, 18-to-24-year-old white
males, who sometimes
vote, and sometimes they
don’t. They just need a
cause and their cause is
me.”

Divided as we are on
most important issues, I
like Howard Stern. And as
a member of  demo-
graphic, my ' opinion is

“Because if they ﬁne us for
indecency, then they have to ﬁne Oprah.

‘And if they ﬁne Oprah, then the whole

game is up.” p

But Winfrey remains un-fmed while
Stern believes his days in radio are num-
bered. Ever the martyr — he once
released an album titled Cruciﬁed by the
FCC which depicted him ‘carrying a
cross — Stern sees this recent govem-
ment intervention as a concerted effort
to get him off the air. He had been an
active supporter of the war in Iraq since

it began, but recently changed his tune, F

the Bush administration.

“I’ll tell you what,” Stern said in a
recent broadcast. “I will get George W.

“We want them to ﬁne us Columnist Stem’s gotten me through
-for this,” Stern said. many a dull morning of

summer construction work
and for that I’m grateful. Whether or not
he’s as powerful and persecuted as he
believes, I’m not sure, but I do think his
recent free speech crusade is justiﬁed.
Many of Stem’s shows center on
crude humor and naked porn stars,
which are hardly necessary or even ben-
eﬁcial elements of public discourse. If
the FCC were to can Stem’s show, I
think society would move along as
before, and radio would indeed be clean-
er. But, that being said, there is some-
thing profoundly indecent about a piece
of legislation like the Broadcast
Decency Enforcement Act. While the
FCC is not responsible for clearly stat-
ing the parameters of indecency, this Act
will give them free rein to exact ﬁnes of
up to $500,000 when they decide some-

one has violated their vagaries. It’s like
issuing speeding tickets without posting

. If this act passes, as it likely will, it
will be a drastic setback for free speech.
And interestingly, the debate has
become nonpartisan in both camps. The
House of Representatives approved the
Act by a landslide vote of 391-22, and
things are predicted to go just as smooth-
ly in the Senate. For the opposition,
Stern has received strong support from
unlikely comers:

“I am in the free speech business,

my friends. I couldn’t survive without
it,” said Rush Limbaugh in a recent
broadcast. “It’s one thing for a company
to determine if they are going to be party
to [indecency]. It’s another thing for the
government to do it.”
_ If people are angry enough about the
material presented by Howard Stern —
and, by extension, Oprah Winfrey - they
have the power, as consumers, to chal-
lenge it. But it is vitally important that
government stay out of this business of
shutting people up.

As for blumpkins and tossed salads,
you’ll have to do your own research. I
could deﬁne them for you here, but I
certainly don’t have $500,000.

And the students who decide not to transfer are
left with a partly deserted school.
Allowing the students to transfer out does
nothing to correct the problem. In fact, if
anything, it passes off some of the failing
students to another district and simply
makes them someone else’s problem.

If, after being classiﬁed, a school
continues failing to meet state standards,
then the state can’ take over the school or
transfer the administration of it over to a
private company. The staff can be
replaced completely or partially. Because
of this, all teachers in the district could be

Child Left Behind requires that schools

below the state’s standards, then it will be classiﬁed as
a danger school, the parents and students will be
informed, and the students will be given the option of

transferring out of the school to another local school. I

The logistics of this are staggering. The problem

them into new classes with unfamiliar peers and dif-

penalized for the incompetence of a few.

The problem is, oftentimes, the teach-

ers are not lacking skill and effort at all. Pittsburgh
schools are doing poorly on-standardized tests, but
I’ve been there and I’ve seen that many of the teach-

‘ ers are highly qualiﬁed, gifted and giving people who

implement good teaching practices in the classroom
and make every effort to educate the students in the
best way possible.

So ‘what is themystery variable in this equation
which the government is not recognizing or account-
ing for? Parents, plain and simple. If the parents do not
care about the child’s education, then there is a much
higher chance that the child will adopt an attitude of
apathy. Even the best teacher cannot fully erase dam-

tional screenplays as they want, but “Stand ‘and
Deliver” just isn’t an accurate picture of the possibili-
. ties that are open to most teachers. The demands of the
state standardized tests take up more and more time
A and energy. There just isn’t time to change 16 years of
ingrained apathy.

A parent who is quick to point the finger at the
teachers of the district should take the time to consid-
er the last time she encouraged her teen-age son to do
his math homework instead of watching TV, or when
she last read a book to her 7-year-old daughter.
Change begins at home. '

And if a government comprised of mainly politi— _ '

cians who haven’t seen the inside of a classroom since

college (and maybe not even then) desires to pass an ‘

act about education, perhaps they ought to consult
with those who have been in the trenches.
One hundred percent passing proﬁciency is a
beautiful dream, but, like most dreams, it has certain
inconsistencies that show up in the light of reality.
‘Student and parent apathy can never be 100 percent
eliminated by a teacher, no matter how many penalties
are hanging over the teacher’s head.

she, too, can put up with the bureaucratic bull that
misled politicians turn into law. She can be reached at

Head—butting the stereotype that is often joked about

I am a huge fan of MTV’s

7‘New1y.weds.’,’ And I often _find_...

myself asking, “Is Jessica Simpson
really that stupid?” Sure, she thought
“Chicken of the Sea” was chicken.
And on last week’s episode, she did-
n’t know that oregano

does that make her dumb?
Obviously, she has something

going on in that head of hers. I mean, —

she certainly is not financially chal-

and hit TV‘ show, along with her ‘

recently marketed makeup line
“Dessert” at Sephora, couldn’t be
launched without some sort ,of_,,brain
and business sense about her. In
those regards, she’s got a good head

, on her shoulders, even if it is bland. _‘
Then why, I ask you, is she cred-

ited as being the stereotypical “dumb
blonde?” Is -it because she’s an

attractive woman? Is it simply the

color of her hair? Or is it because of
the stupid remarks that always seem
to be coming out of her mouth?

still hate the stereo- .

type ‘given to the bleach-blonde
women in our world. Perhaps being a
woman I find the stereotype insult-

Regardless, if you think about it,
most likely these women got their
hair color prepackaged by L’Orea1

Monica Lewinsky a few
years back. I hardly think I need to
elaborate on the story behind that
woman.

. So I just don’t understand why
we continue to make fun of women
like Jessica Simpson. Why not make
these comments about her husband?

After all, he married her. And he
went solo with his music career —
probably one of the stupidest deci-
sions he ever made. I think he was
onto something when he released the
first single off his debut solo album
“Shut up.”

But still the camera captures
Jessica’s idiotic moves, at times, to
make her look —- can you believe it?
— like an idiot. 

Would it make a difference if she
were a brunette? And if Nick looked
like the blond, wavy-haired Ken

. doll, would every one of his ﬂaws be

magnified and analyzed for the cam-
era?

Fortunately, Jessica has a good
sense of humor and can make fun of
herself, like in her latest music video
“With You.” Though the song makes
me rather nauseous at times, good
for her for being a good sport.

We all have our blonde moments.
But perhaps we should rethink the
“dumb blonde’’ stereotype.

And as a brunette who knows
that Buffalo wings are not, in fact,
made of buffalo, that’s saying a lot.

N emtsanov represents Pitt
at NCAA»Championships 

NATE BERGER
Staff Writer

Panther diver Dennis Nemtsanov
received All-American honors Thursday as
he earned 294.2 points and ﬁnished 11th on
the one-meter board‘ at , the NCAA
Championships at the Nassau County
Aquatics Center in East Meadow, NY

Nemtsanov, who ﬁnished in 11th place
last year on the platform as a freshman,
became the ﬁrst Panther diver since John
Soulakis to earn at least Honorable Mention
All-American ‘status more I than once.
Soulakis was a two-time Honorable
Mention All-American and a two—time All-

. “He performed ‘extremely well on
Thursday,” Pitt head diving coach ‘Julian

Krug said. “Afterthathisperformancepret ‘
. ty much went downhill.” 5

On Friday Nemtsanov, a ‘sophomore,
ﬁnishedin34thplacewithasco1eof240.95
on the three-meter board and on Saturday he
ﬁnished in last place behind 23 other com-
petitors on the Platform.

Nemtsanov has been bothered by an
injured shoulder that he had surgery on last

events. The higher you go up the more stress
you put on your shoul  . "

Krug said that the injury also set back
Nemtsanov’s preparation and training,
which he was worried about v 2

“He felt that he was kind of behind the
eight ball,” Krug said. ‘ ‘

Krug expects Nemtsanov’s shoulder to
be 100 percent healthy by. the beginning of
next season. He also expects big things from
N emtsanov next season.

- “He can’t really do much better in the
regular season,” Krug said of Nemtsanov,
who ﬁnished inﬁrst place 13 times this year,
earned two All-Big East honors and became

the ﬁrst Panther Big East diving champion "

since 1991. “I wouldlikehimtobeinthe top

‘ eight [at the NCAA Championships] in one

of the events and be an All-American.”

N emtsanov is the only Pitt diver to qual- 1

ify for ﬂre NCAA Championships in the last 5 v » .

two years. Nemtsanov qualiﬁed for the
NCAA championships this year by having
solid performances at the NCAA Zone ‘A’
Prequals March 12-13 at the U.S. Naval

Academy inAnna_polis, 1 '
He won the one-meter competition with ‘
a score of 608.4. Nemtsanov ﬁnished in ﬁfth ‘

May.

When Pitt  Page missed a desperation shot
as time expired in the ig East Tournament Championship
gamebackonMarch l'§,IsatinthepressboxatMadison
Square Garden wondering how Pitt lost to UConn 61-58.

After Pitt bealing_ the Huskies 75-68 at the Petersen

Events Center in February, I was convinced that Pitt was the i

better team. During the season, UConn lost to Providence at
home and then, when they lost to Syracuse hr the last game
of the season, my mind was pretty much made up that
UConn was overrated. A" '

Yes, Pitt lost to the 'Orangemen, but the Panthers lost
because of their inability to shoot at times. If Pitt had a rea-
sonable day shooting the_ ball it would have beaten Syracuse.
Furthermore, Syracuse did not break the 50-point mark in
either of its contests with the Panthers.

UConn is built diiferently than the Panthers, as the
Huskies are a pretty reliable shooting team along with being
a strong defensive team. These qualities are good enough to
win a championship and if the Panthers possessed both qual-
ities they would be almost unbeatable.

Now that I have witnessed the Huskies overcome a 12-
point deﬁcit in the secondphalf to go on to beat Pitt — a team
that is lights out on defense — in the waning minutes of
games along with their play in the NCAA Tournament so far

‘causesmetoreconsid- »

er my thinking. The
Huskies have had an
easy road to the Final
Four, but they have
been dominant

After all, UConn
was ranked the No.-1
team in college has-
ketball in the presea-
son polls. I guess on
paper they do appear to have the most talent. It was just a
matter of the talented players pulling together and putting. the
product on the court that most expected.

The Huskies have two legitimate big men with center
Emeka Okafor and forward Josh Boone. Both players are 6-
foot, 10-inches tall. Okafor was ﬁrst in the Big East with an
average of 4.21 blocked shots per game while Boon was sev-
enth, blocking an average of 1.75 shots per game. These two
players gave UConn the inside presence that a national title

 

contender needs.

Too often, the Huskies have been knocked for not hav-
ing a point guard. Apparently the play of point guard Taliek
Brown had not been up to par. But despite only averaging 6.2

lly living  to expectations

points per game, Brown actually leads the Big East in assists

per. game with6.65. Apoint guar-d’s role focuses more on set-

ting up good shots for the olfense anyway.
GuardBenGordonhasalsosteppedup.Asamatterof

A fact, he put UConn on his back and droveithern past the

Panthers in its Big East Tournament Championship game
victory. He was able to hit up Page, who is one of the better
defenders in the country, for 23 points.

In some cases Gordon was able to ‘score on Page even
when Page could not have defendedihim any better. Gordon

has had a huge presence from outside ‘along with forward .

Rashad Anderson as they lead their team in three-point per-,

centage connecting on 43.7 and 41 percent of their attempts. ‘
UConn’s_ outside game is arguably the main reason that -

it is traveling to San Antonio, Texas to play in the Final Four
while the Panthers are home for the season. The Huskies lead
the Big East in three-point ﬁeld goal percentage at 40.3 per-

cent while Pitt was No. 13 out of 14 teams as a result of. ..

shooting at 30.6 percent clip ﬁ'om three-point range.

Pitt led its conference in the least amount of points
allowed per game with 56.4 while the Huskies on average
gave up 63.3 per game, putting them third in the Big East.
