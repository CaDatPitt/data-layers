Will it be hot sauce? Cream cheese?
What about a stick of butter?

“Maybe ketchup. I love ketchup,”
said a woman in a navy polo.

“I’m expecting room tempera- '

ture mayonnaise,” said a red—haired
woman to her left. .

Andrea Poe, a senior industrial
engineering major and co—chair of
this year’s E—Week, entered from the
left. '

.“Are you all here for Mystery

Eats?” she said.

“Oh yeah,” was the response.

Mystery Eats — which occurred
yesterday afternoon in Benedum Hall
—— is one of a series of events in Pitt’s
56th annual E—Week that began last
Tuesday, atradition that, technically,
runs for a Week and. a half.

Pitt’s E-Week has beenheld each "

year in March since -1954 in honor
of St. Patrick, often considered the
patron saint of engineering. The tra-
dition ‘evolved from National Engi-
neeringWeek— atime each February
when engineering contributions are
celebrated across the country and
young Americans are encouraged to
pursue careers_in science.

Pitt’s Swanson School of Engi-
neering commemorates this time of
the year with a sequence of interde-
partmental contésts, some of which
involve engineering skills — like a
soap box derby and a paper airplane
contest — and others which just
don’t. Non-engineering students can
come to watch many of the events,
but only engineering students can
participate.

“The ﬁrst thing I need is for you
guys to sign our Mystery Eats waiver,”
Poe armounced — before explaining

The health care reform bill Presi-
dent Barack Obama signed into law
yesterday is a daunting document,
to say the least. _

The law, the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act, will require

most people to have health insurance
by 2014. Under the law, about 32 mil-

lion more people will have health
insurance coverage by 2019.
To help sort through the particu-

/

lars of the law, The Pitt News sat in
on a conference call hosted by the
Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-
proﬁt, nonpartisan organization

that studies health issues. .

Representatives from the founda-
tion said one of the most signiﬁcant
aspects of the law is a provisionthat
will allow young adults across the na-
tion to stay on their parents’ health
insurance until they turn 26.

Bianca Dijulio, a principal policy
analyst at the Kaiser Family Foun-

T dation, and Jennifer Tolbert, the

associate director of the founda-

tion’s Commission on Medicaid and
the -Uninsured explained the new
terms.

iWhat qualiﬁcations do stu-
dents have to meet to stay on their
parents’ health insurance? Will
the employer issuing insurance
decide if an “adult child” can stay ’
on their parents’ insurance?

Tolbert: I don’t believe it’s the
employer who limitswho qualiﬁes,
but the interpretation of the regula-
tion specifying who would qualify as

on their parents’ insurance] will be
spelled out in regulations issued by
the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services.

I think that if an employer cur-

is that there was a privilege that
said [youngadults] had to be un-
married; that was removed. As- far as

we know, a dependent no longer has i

to beunmarried. There is no other
speciﬁcation as to who qualiﬁes as
an adult child. '

Do you know when the U.S. De-
partment of Health and Human
Services will issue those regula-
tions? '

Tolbert: The timeline for the ’

provision is six months within‘en—

WASHINGTON ‘ President Barack
Obama on Tuesday signed into law a
vastoverhaul ofthe nation’s healthcare
system, the most sweeping expansion
of government social policy in more
than 40 years, and perhaps the most
polarizing.‘
Atriumphantobamaheraldedwhat
he called “a new season in Ameri ”
sayingthat the new lawﬁnally delivered
changes inhealthcarethat generations
of Americans had sought and fought

for. _

“Our presence here today is re-
markable and improbable,” Obama
said. “It’s been easy at times to doubt
our ability to do such a big thing, such
acomplicatedthing; towonder ifthere
are limits to what we, as a people, can
still achieve.”

Now, however; he said, “we are af-
firming that essential truth — a truth
every generationis calledtorediscover
for itself— thatwearenotanationthat
scales back its aspirations.” v

The president signed the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act,
cheered on by Democratic lawmakers

as well as Vicki Kennedy, the widow of
thelate Sen. EdwardKennedy, D—Mass.,

who’d made the expansion of health

care his life’s work.

Supporters interrupted several
times with applause and campaignlike
chants, turning the ceremony into a
celebration Evenbefore Obarnawalked

ministration soon. Nothinghas been

issued yet.

What about adults who have,
because of their age, already been
kicked off their parents’ health
insurance?

Tolbert: If they meet the new re-

quirements, they will be able to get .

back on. The regulations are going to
specify who qualiﬁes as a dependent.
If, when those rules go into effect
six months from now, they meet the
requirements, they would be able to
go back on the policy. It’s not clear
whether they have to live with their
parents to get those.

Who will pay for young adults
to stay on their parents’ insurance
plans? ‘

Tolbert: The way these policies '

work now is that the premiums are
shared between the individual and
their employer, and so for cases in
which the coverage was extended to
these adult children, the premium
would beshared between the em-
ployer and the employee.

Suddenly the family is now

growing. How do you think that

will pan out for the nation?

Dijulioz I don’t think we know

- { exactly how the cost of the planswill
A be structured, but you’re right inthat

employers have different types of

for parents’ health plans

coverage and their contributions to
that coverage varies. We’re going to
have to kind of wait and see how that
all comes out.

Tolbert: These young adults, by
and large, are afairly low-‘cost popu-
lation, so under a situation in which
there is a mandate [to have health
care], which kicks in 2014, every-
one will be comi_ng into the pool,

.including those very healthy young

adults. This is a relatively 1ow—cost
population overall.

What will happen to people
who already have coverage from
their employer?

Tolbert: I think it’s safe to say
that for most people with employer

coverage, they’re not likely to see

much of a change in their policy.
What about people who use
ﬂexible spending accounts to help

with their insurance coverage?

A .ih'I‘olbert: Beginning in 2o13, the

‘amount of money that people can

set aside in a ﬂex spending account
will be limited to $2,500 per year.
That is a reduction from the existing
limit today, although unfortunately

I don’t know what the existing limit

is today.
Beginning in 2011, people will

no longer be able to  use them for '

over thecounter drugs  without a
doctor’s prescription.

‘All kinds of silly games’

E-Week 4 1

S the rules.

Each participating department could have a
team of three students, as long as each included
at least one woman, arule necessitated by Pitt’s
low ratio of fe_male—to-male engineers. There
would be seven rounds, each involvinga different
smoothie—inspired concoction of unsmoothie-
like ingredients. The ﬁrst team to finish each
round would receive two points. Any team to
successfully ﬁnish the round would earn one.
The teamto ﬁnish lastwould receive zero points,
and teams that were unable to ﬁnish the round
within three minutes would be disqualiﬁed.

Doing characteristically quick math, the
students soon realized that seven rounds with
teams of no more than three members left one
contestant drinkingthree cups of mystery slime.
Even. more unfortunately, only one woman
showed up fromthebioengineering department,
leaving her responsible for all seven.

“Shame, BioE, shame,” she said. ,

After explaining the rules, Poe led the stu-
dents back to the loading dock Where the con-
test would take place. There were Dumpsters

overﬂowing with old school desks and sawdust
on the ground.

“This kind of looks like a bomb site,” one
student said as he walked out into the rain.

Five of the seven engineering departments
participated, their groups of students lining up
behind a wooden table. Teams from industrial
engineering — lastyear’s E-Weekvictors — and
chemical engineering were rumored to be the
most competitive. Brad Lyons, who coordinated
E—Week activities for chemical engineering, said
his team was in it to win it. “Losing is not an
option,” he said. .

Poe explained that there really is no prize for
winning except bragging rights. For her, E-Week
is more about bringing students from different
departments together.

“I justthinkit’s so muchfunto do something
with people from engineering that’s outside of

class and that’s just for fun,” she said. “Some—

times things can get so serious with schoolwork
and jobs and internships and co—ops that it’s nice
to just take the time out and have this fun little
week where we do all kinds of silly games.”

decade, according to the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Ofﬁce.

It’s the broadest move bythefederal
government to guarantee health care
since the creation of Medicare for the

_ elderly in 1965. It exceeds the expan-

sion of Medicare to cover prescription
drugs, passed by the Republicans and

The Senate expects a ﬁnal vote

' Thursday on the reconciliation plan.

The House already has approved it.
Republicans suffered a major blow

from the Senate parliamentarian late

Monday in their effort to derail the

, reconciliation bill.

According to GOP Senate officials,
Parliamentarian Alan Frumin gave
them informal guidance that a key

part of their plan to challenge the bill"
. won’t hold up. .

Republicans’ best hope of over-
turning the reconciliation legislation
involved Socialsecurity. Theirthinking
wentlike this: Since the newbill delays
an excise tax on-high—end insurance
plans until 2018 — it’s due to begin in
2013 in the Senate bill —— that would
mean less revenue for Social Security,

Visit www.arrival.itt.edu to review job descriptions

andthus wouldn’tbe permissible under
reconciliation rules. ,

However, the parliamentarian ad-
vised them that the tax delay was in
order.

Republicans still plan a series
of procedural challenges as well as
amendments. Sen.]udd Gregg of New
Hampshire,thetop Republican onthe
Senate Budgetcommittee, setthetone
by calling the legislation “the fourth
majorstep forwardinthe pushto drive
this country down a road towards a
European-style government.”

The other three, he said, were
“quasi—nationalization of the ﬁnancial
system, nationalization of the auto-
mobiles, quasi—nationalization of the
health industry and now this bill has
in it, which nobody’s focused on, the
nationalization of the student loan

  industry.”

Democrats stuck to a different
script, citing examples of individuals
and businesses who’d beneﬁtunderthe
newlaw. Senate Majority LeaderHarry
Reid, D—Nev., who’s facing a difficult
re-election campaign, described how
some 24,000 small businesses in his
state now will be able to afford insur-
ance for their employees.

Gleim said the delay caused by the mechani— .

calproblems “wasn’t that bad.”
“You make the best of it,” Gleim said. “Itwas
unfortunate because we had such a great day at

the Capitol.”

It’s justone ofthose “ﬂukey” things youwalk

* away from with a story, Gleim said.

John Hasley, Governmental Relations Com-
mittee member, said Pitt Day inHarrisburgwas
“a lot of ﬁin.” ’

Hasley visited 11 offices but only spoke with
three legislators because many were busy.

Hasley saidhe spokewith Sen. Wayne Fonta- ‘

na(D -42nd), Rep. Scott Petri (R—178th), and Rep.
Kenyattajohnson (D -186th) with his group.

The legislators were “extremely positive
about Pitt,” Hasley said. Hasley said he focused
on telling legislators about Pitt’s identity and
“the big changes that are happening.”

As the amount of students applying for Pitt
increases, so does the caliber of the accepted
students who contribute to the economy and
commonwealth, Hasley said. '

“As a student, I thought it was my duty to

ﬁght for Pitt and get it the funding it deserves,”
he said. ' i

Hasley watched as the House of Represen-
tatives passed the state appropriations bill in
a vote yesterday which Hasley thought “was
pretty cool.” 4

Everyone was helpful if there were any prob-
lems navigatingthrough the building, said Has-
ley. ,

bers yesterday was a good experience.

Want to go green?
Do something.

ave you ever off—handedly
H complained about any of
the following: Student
Government Board, the envi-
ronment, Pitt’s administration
or that nasty stench outside of
Towers patio?
.In attempt to make Pitt a
greener institution,‘ a. group of

H A student organizations proposed

the creation of a new environ-
mental project called the Green
Fund. - ’
This isn’t just another mun-
dane Student Government Board
endeavour, It’s a very simple
idea that could make a very big
impact on Pitt’s environmen-
tal footprint. But at the same
time, it will also raise your se-
mesterly fees andset quite the
precedent for future pet projects.

In short, you should actually care ,

about this one. . _
If initiated, the Green Fund
would be run by a new student
organization called the Student.
Sustainable Projects Committee
+ catchy, we know — a group
composed of nine students who

oversee how the group’s funding

is spent. That funding, by the way,
would come primarily from a new
$5 per semester fee that every
Pitt student would have to pay.
That’s about $160,000 per year,
for those of you playing along at
home. . l _ --

With the blessings of SGB and
a few administrative bodies, the
(project could be underway by
this fall. ‘

There’s this report called the
Sustainable Endowments Insti-

* tute’s College Sustainability Re-

port Card. Essentially, it serves

to evaluate and compare college’s
environmental efforts. To keep
things interesting, the report
gives each school a letter grade.
‘For the past three years, Pitt
has received a “C,” another “C”
and a “C-.” Too bad it couldn’t

' take this one pass/fail.

In comparison, Carnegie Mel-
lon and Penn State both received
B’s this year.

While these grades certainly,
aren’t the be—all, end-all of sus-
tainability evaluation, they serve
as a general indicator that Pitt has
some ground to make up in the
whole going—green department.

Whereas creating this fund
could help Pitt become more envi-

ronmentally friendly, it presents v

some questions in the early stage
in which it currently exists: If we
allow student fees to. beincreased
for this idea, where do we draw

- the line on future projects? Should

an environmentally friendly uni-
versity be a responsibility — and
expense — of its students? How
will these student leaders be se-

’ lected? And is it really best for

SGB to create this project exter-
nally, without its own funding or
personnel? .

What we have is a pretty good
idea, but an unﬁnished one. So
don’t wait until this fund is cre-
ated to off-handedly complain
about it. Now is the time to ac-
tually go to an SGB meeting —
they’re Tuesdays at 8:45 p.m.
in Nordy’s'Place -— or e—mail
president Charlie Shull with your
thoughts — his address is css23@
pitt.edu — on how this can be
created the right way, if itlshould
be created at all.

Ragini Grace Gupta
For The Pitt News-

Four years ago I attended a sum-
mer camp focused on science ex-
ploration in Gainesville, Fla. In

Florida, there’s an obsession of ‘

sorts with water, not only because
of the high coast-to -inland ratio,

but also because of the large aqui— I

fer in the state. Perhaps it makes

sense then that it was at this camp ‘

that I was shown a presentation
on the ills associated with bottled
water.

_ One woman in the crowd lis-
tened intently, but then said,
“Everything gives you cancer. I’m
not going to stop drinking bottled
water,” as she shook her head and
took a big gulp from her plastic
bottle.

Although I was taken aback by
her conﬁdence and assurance at
the time, what she said reﬂects

how ‘I feel now: overwhelmed

' by virtue of being medically in-

formed. Medical information is
everywhere, from websites, tele-
vision shows and magazines to
everyday advice from family and
friends. It is easy for anybody to
come down with medical student
syndrome — where after reading
about a disease,‘ a medical stu-
dent starts thinking he has said
symptoms.

We are constantly bombarded
by conﬂicting and continually
changing studies and investi-
gate reports that this drug or that
seaﬂoor supplement are either

1 panacea or poison. I used to watch

the Dr. Oz Show_every day. In each
episode, Dr. Mehmet Oz tells his
viewers about both miracle foods
and death traps. Blueberries are
antioxidants. Turkey is a great
lean meat. Almonds are good
for revving up the metabolism.
Many white food products aren’t

healthy, and so on.

The trouble comes when there
is talk about bad foods. As “Su-
per Size Me” and “Food Inc.,”
have shown, we are surrounded
by yucky, but yummy food. So
when people tell me to avoid
white foods like white bread, I
know they mean well. But really,
are they trying to torture me? Go-
ing to the dining hall or grocery
store is like some sick taunt where
all I see is “white things” —-— the
easy, layman’s way to identify
foods with processed and reﬁned
white ﬂour. When I look at a loaf
of white sandwich bread, I no lon-
gerlsee my favorite peanut but-
ter and jelly sandwich but rather

think of love handles and spikes-

in blood sugar.

These days everybody is a doc-
tor in the sense that the average
person knows a great deal about
health and many invariably keep
up to date with new ﬁndings.

Columnist

A few years ago, I went through a
Buddhism phase. I read some books
on the topic, did a school project on it
and generally tried to incorporate the
peaceful, calming, Buddhist principles

into my everyday life. It seemed like '

fate when, rightatthepeakof my Bud-
dhism mania, I discovered a quote in
amagazine thatread, “Iwillwalkthe
middle path.” .

This idea of the middle path, or
middle way, is an important Buddhist
principle, focusing on moderation —
which includes avoiding extremes,
in_ order to live a more
peac_eﬁJllife.

Here’s an example female read-
ers might be attuned to: Ovarian
cancer has symptoms quite simi-
lar to less serious GI problems,
and because of this, it often goes
undiagnosed. Now I can’t help but
wonder if that occasional stom-
achache is not acidity, but rather
cancer. Life could easily become
a constant worry about small
aches and pains that we start to
view as serious when warned that
there are actually a whole host of

the time, I’m either wide—awake or on
the verge of falling asleep.

Of course, as hesitant as we might

, There are downsides to living a life
of extremes. People who have the abil-
ity to walk the middle path must lead
peaceful, stress—free lives compared
to those of us who are constantly liv-
ing on one end of the spectrum. In our

defense, though, we extremists do have
some ﬁm. I ﬁnd that I have atendency
toboth overanalyze and overreact, and
life would be much easier ifl didn’t have
to deal with such issues.

, But I can’t help but wonder: Is the
middle path really that great? Those
who adhere to this principle would

In our later years we might look
back ashamedly on college revelry.
Sure, wehad a good time, but perhaps
it’s this reﬂection that could prompt
leading a more balanced life even if it
doesn’t begin until after college. Ifwe
go through collegebehavedyetbored,
there could be less motivation to carry
on abalanced life.

Attend just onefratpatty, andyou’ll

diseases that people didn’t know
existed and which have symptoms
similar to those of relatively
harmless health issues.

So it’s easy to get overwhelmed
by all the information. But don’t
get ﬂusterecl or panic.

I got to the point where all I.
had room in my brain to think
about was not eating the easily
accessible bad foods, ﬁnding and
eating the good foods and dwell-
ing on the constant monitoring

of my body, wondering whether
any conditions were symptoms of
life—threatening diseases.

Sure, it’s vital to be informed,
but don’t adopt all the things
you hear — it’s not productive.
Take things in increments and
be choosy. Remember life goes

, beyond being healthy — don’t

go completely out of your way to
take on some new health tip or the
inconvenience of it could prompt
quick abandonment. If you hear

that white, processed foods are I
not healthy, be conscious and try
wheat bread and pasta when you

go to the store — you don’t have ,

to go cold turkey. Any adjustment
can be tough, but a gradual one
will prove better in the end.
When you learn ofpa positive
health tip, especially an exercise
tip, adopt it gradually, and make
sure it’s something you can real-
istically commit to. Trips to the
gym would have to become day-

Everything— is not — in moderation

allthat compatible with the stereotypi-
calcollege lifestyle. This applies not only
to weekend activities but also to sports.
APantherwin creates aUniversity-wide
feeling of euphoria, while a loss sends
us into a collective depression. And let
us not forget the intense happiness
we all felt several weeks ago when we
found outthat ourclasseswere canceled
because of the weather -— only to be

followed by bitter resentment upon _

learning that we might be responsible
for  them up on weekends.
Whereas Buddhism might say that
I’ll never lead a balanced life without
walking the middle path, I tend to be-
lieve that my extremes actually work
to balance each other out. Given the

choice between living an average life '

and alife thatvaries from one extreme
to another; 111 risk the latter option.
So maybefllneverhavethe capacity

FlLM FEATURE

Jocelyn Meehan

Staff Writer

Looking for something different and
hip(ster) to do this weekend that in-
volves an indie movie, a retro venue
and a BYOPBR (bring your own Pabst
Blue Ribbon) policy?

No, I’m not talking about going
to your indie friend Rich’s again, but
rather makingatrip to the Hollywood
Theatre in Dormont where the multi-
international award-winning feature
ﬁlm “Confusions of an Unmarried
Couple,” byjason and Brett Butler, is
screeningfrom March 27-30 as part of
the Indies for Indies ﬁlm series.

“‘Conﬁisions of an Unmarried

' Couple’ is basically a raw, brutal and

intimate personal look at a relation-
ship gone wrong,” Brett Butler said.

The ﬁlm’s plot playfully follows ‘

Dan (Brett Butler) and Lisa (Naomi

Johnson) in a somewhat documen- ,

tary—style narrative of investigating
why their relationship failed. Don’t
get too excited, tortured souls and

emo kids alike, because although the »

story sounds sad and appropriate for
quotingingloomy Facebook statuses,

. it’s a comedy.

“It’s that uncomfortable humor
that you can relate to,” Brett said, “and

we wanted it to beas realas possible,
sweat-and everything...We wantyou
to smell the characters —- Smell-o-
Vision.” d
The idea for the ﬁlm developed
when Brett wrote a short script and
began ﬁlming himself, “exercising

' demons in front of the camera,” by

setting up and acting out such familiar
emotions faced in relationships as
jealousy and paranoia. ‘

Brett sentthe footage tohisbroth-
erjason, who ended up lovingthe idea.
Thus, the Butlerbrother collaboration
was hatched in a Substance Produc-
tion of hilarious “off-beat comedy”,
ﬁlmed on a “blazing hot weekend”
in aToronto apartment.

The Butler brothers have already
nabbed the deserved ﬁlm festival
awards of, “best comedy,” “best fea-
ture” and “best direction”.

This realistic ﬁlm is set to screen

at The Hollywood Theatre in Dor-

mont at 1449 Potomac Ave. along
with Clay Liford’s short “My Mom
Smokes Weed,” acomedy that played
at Sundance this year.

“The Hollywood Theatre is an old
theater that’s been restored. There
are couches and a balcony, and the
theater is BYOB, — so you can drink
beer during the movie (assuming

you’re old enough). It’s been called

one of the best art-house theaters in
the country,” said Lucas McNelly, a
blogger and associate of the Holly-
wood Theatre and Indies for Indies
program.

McNelly explained that the Indies
for_ Indies weekly screenings show
some of the best ﬁlms from the festi-
val and self-distribution circuits.

“We try to get the best and most
interesting ﬁlms that aren’t getting
picked up by studios for distribution
-— either because they’re low-budget,
orthey aren’t commercial orthey just
haven’t found adistributor yet. We’re
playingﬁlms from Sundance, SXSW,
Slamdance, Cannes and even some
World Premieres,” McNelly said.

Besides giving local ﬁlmmakers
an opportunity to show their work,
Indies for Indies brings Pittsburgh
audiences types of ﬁlms that normally
don’t venue outside of the bigger cit-
ies, McNe1ly said.

“As far as I know, there’s only a

(‘couple of cities in the country that
have a series like this (NYC, LA, Bal-
timore, San Diego and Austin), so it’s’
' really a golden opportunity we have
a to show the country that a city like

Pittsburgh cansupport independent
ﬁlm,” McNelly said. .

Screenings are Saturday at 4:30
p.m., Monday at7 p.m. and Tuesday at

9:30 p.m., with a $6 admission fee.
“We also do a deal where ifyou go
see a ﬁlm and then come back with
new people for that same ﬁlm, we’ll
knock $2 off your ticket for every new

person you bring,” he said. “So, if you
go to the Saturday show and come
back on Monday with three of your
friends, you can see the ﬁlm again

Thrift shops soothe sartorial students

Samantha delves into the complex and sometimes scary world of thrifting, with pleasantly satisfying results.

Like legions of other graduating

of panic and an eerily uncharac-
teristic come-what-may attitude.
Worrying about how I’ll support
myself after graduation has be-
come a gruesome daily task.
Incidentally, my lack of income
creates a Catch-22: There’s noth-
ing that could calm my trajectory-

Yet nothing l_aunches me into a

a bigger frenzy than realizing I

haven’t a dime to spend on said
wardrobe updates. .
As a result, I am left scrounging
for the cheapest way. to add new
clothes to my closet. Enter thrift
shopping. Contrary to popular
belief, thrift stores are quite the
treasure trove. Thrifting is good

‘ for more than Halloween cos-

are your objectives, thrift stores
can come in handy as well.

Once, my friend and I witnessed

No one said getting cheap clothes

The feeling of ﬁnding some-

that only thrifting can fulﬁll. If

contradictory descriptions such as these .

have raised eyebrows in the music press,
guitarist and vocalist Nicole Barille has a
simple explanation for the band’s peculiar
musical stylings. .
“I grew up with grunge being a big inﬂu¥
ence, but [drummer Sam Meister] was really
into classic rock and trip hop. It ended up
working out, though, because we found
that we didn’t limit each other to what we
liked or disliked. We were able to stay open

minded,” she said.

Barille said that Mr. Gnome grew out of
mutual “free time we had after ﬁnishing
college. We just started to experiment with
things — I’d usually come up with a riff or a
melody. Then we’d juststart to play off each

   
 

.— other and see where it went.”

‘ That creative partnership has propelled
the band through the recording of two EPs

‘ Courtesy FX
Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) takes justice into his own hands with Ava Crowder
‘(Joelle Carter).

Kieran Layton
‘. A&E Editor

“Justified” -
Tuesdays, 10 p.m.’
FX Network

‘Starring: Timothy Olyphant, Natalie

Zea
Created by: Graham Yost
Grade:' A— '

Just as “Deadwood” is slatedto become
an HBO relic to be admired but not often
thought about and the “310 to Yuma” re-
make is already forgotten by 97 percent of
moviegoers, along comes a new show that
adopts only the most subtle elements of
the—Western genre and turns it into some-
thing totally bad*ss.

The show is “Justified,” and it is justiﬁ-
ably awesome.

Starring Timothy Olyphant (Sheriff
Seth Bullock on “Deadwood”) as Kentucky-
born cop Raylan Givens, and based on the
Elmore Leonard novella, “Justified” is the"
kind of cable show that could only work
on FX. It’s gritty, violent, vulgar and by

Justifiably intense, gritty, great television

all means offensive — qualities that the
network’s most successful shows share.

After a faux pas shooting in Miami, Giv-
ens is transferred back to his hometown
(which he was seemingly exiled from fear
his questionable decisions) to work on
the case of Boyd Crowder (Walter Goggin)
—- an old coal mining friend who is now a
neo—Nazi criminal kingpin.-

From the pilot episode, it’s obvious that
Boyd is slated to join the ranks of the most
memorable television villains. Think Ben
Linus from “Lost,” or_]erri Manthey from
“Survivor.” '

Essentially, the show’s success comes
down to two factors: the neo-Western am-
biance and Olyphant’s performance.

First, the subtle warm camera palette;
the small symbols of Western iconogra-

phy — like Raylan’s hat —— and the East‘

Kentucky—meets—Old Western setting
places the show somewhere in the same
realm as" “No Country for Old Men.” It’s
so obviouslylmodern, but a timeless (and
sinister) undertone pumps through every
vein of dialogue or direction.

Then there’s Timothy Olyphant. Just
as Goggin’s Crowder is memorably evil,

Barille described the experience as re-
freshing, particularly given the “difficult”
environment that the music industry has
found itself in for the last several years.

“It really feels like there are no rules in
it right now. It looks like it’s crumbling, so
everything has become sort of spastic and
disorganized.”

The band. recorded several more tracks
in Cleveland beforesending everything off
to Butch Vig’s Smart Studios in Madison,
Wis., a process that Barille describes as
being “much more drawn-out than our last
album.”

“We had actually written all of the mate-
rial before going to Los Angeles,” she said.

Panthers turn to juniors forleadership  

With no seniors to send Off, Pitt hopes its juniors can step up andlhelp the Panthers rebound from a disappointing season.

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ"Wri ter

For many teams, a senior.recogni-
tion game is an important part of the

fans acknowledge the dedication

hers‘.

However, the Pitt women’s bas-
V jketball team was deprived of this
irnemorable experience this year,
they-posted no senior members
‘’ iibnithe 2009-1o roster.

This young Panther team ﬁn-
ished the season with a‘ 16-15 re-
cord overall and a Big East record
of 5-11, including ﬁrst-round exits
from both the Big East tournament
and the Women’s National Invita-
tional Tournament.

Head coach Agnus Berenato un-
derstands the value of senior leader-

V ship and its importance in building a
‘successful basketball program.

“In the past few years, we have

had those players that lead on and

year we had Shavonte Zellous as a
veteran player, but this year, with
no seniors, it was tough to get that
experience.” _

Coming into this season, the
Panthers had played in three
straight NCAA Tournaments, in-
cluding back-to-back Sweet 16 ap-
pearances.

This meant that at the beginning
of the year, with no seniors on the
team, the Panthers of this season

off the court,” Berenato said. “Last ‘

only knew success. This year’s dis-
appointment came as a shock, es-
pecially to junior forward Chelsea
Cole. “' _

“I would say that we really un-
derachieved this season,” Cole said.
“Last year we‘ said that anything less
than a Sweet 16 appearance would
be a disappointment, and we didn’t
even make the Tournamen .”

Berenato echoed that sentiment,
noting the hard work that must ac-
company such ambitions.

“This team has only experienced
postseason play and Tournament
appearances,” Berenato said. “They

' have to realize, though, that success

like that do esn’t come without hard
work and preparation.”
Throughout the season, the Pan-
thers displayed bursts of that effort
and commitment to winning, but it
was not enough to make an impact
when NCAA Tournament selection
time approached. V
Close games characterized the
Panthers’ season, but while they
were able to win those tight con-
tests early on, they struggled to pull

away with victories as the season

came to a close.

. “In the beginning, we won those
close games,” Berenato said. “We
were able to beat St. Francis (Pa.)
by ﬁve and Austin Peay by one in
overtime, and both of those teams
made the NCAA Tournament.”

According to Berenato, January
marked the start of the Panthers’ fall
to the bottom of the Big East.

“We just couldn’t ﬁnish,” Ber-

enato said. “Teams always go on
streaks and runs, but this year, we
seemed to hit a losing run at a bad
time.”

Being a member of the Big East
certainly did not help the Panthers
in their search to generate winning
momentum, especially at their low-
est point, which saw the Panthers
dropfnine often games.

“The Big East is the best confer-
ence in the nation,” Berenato said.
“The Big East had 11 teams in post-
season play, and some conferences
don’t even have that many teams to
begin with.” ’ A

Nevertheless, Berenato does no
regret Pitt’s placement in the tough
conference. ‘

“In the BigVEast, we get to see
premier teams like Connecticut,
Notre Dame and West Virginia on
a regular basis,” Berenato said. “It
allows us to attract competitive
players to our program, players that
want to play on a high level.”

However disappointing the sea-
son might appear as a whole, certain
individuals excelled on the court
and earned recognition.

Cole and teammate Jania Sims
were both named to the Big East
Honorable Mention Team, an ac-
complishment that Berenato ac-
knowledged with pride.

“It was great to see Chelsea and

Jania make the Honorable Mention
Team,” Berenato said. “We did not
have any players on any of the pre-
season teams, so that really shows
improvement.”

Pitt softball goes 3-2 at James Madison Invitational

Softball 1 16 —

“We reduced our strikeouts, we hit the ball

on the ground, we had more quality at-bats and .

we had a few extra base hits which obviously
helped our run production,” Aprile said.

. Cory Berliner picked up the win against
Winthrop, allowing ﬁve hits and tying a season
high with six strikeouts.

It was in the next game, a rematch with
Fordham, that Amistade drove in the winning
run with her extra—inning heroics.

The Panthers scored ﬁrst in the game, put-
ting two runs on the board at the bottom of

the ﬁrst inning. Fordham, however, answered T

by scoring two runs of its own at the top of
the second. ‘

: Fordham took the lead at the top of the
fourth inning, but Stevens knotted the game
at three with a homerun in the ﬁfth. . ,

Alyssa O’Connell earned the win on the

triple, 21 RBI and three stolen bases. She leads
Pitt with a .375 batting average. ‘

Let’s hope Netswin title of mo

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

 

With 12 games to go in the season, the
Newjersey Nets are on the brink of his-
tory, gloriously horrendous history.
Heading into tonight’s game against
the Sacramento Kings, the Nets stand at
7-63. Or rather,~sit at 7-63, as standing
implies being somewhat active.
Better yet, lay at 7—63.

The most losses in one season in NBA ‘

history occurred back in the 1972-73
season, when the Philadelphia 76ers
went 9-73. That year, the 76ers lost
their first 15 games and later lost 20
straight. ‘ ' ’

The Nets started off strong this year, A

losing their first 18 games, a first in
NBA history. Then they went on a run,
winning three of their next 14 before
losing 13 of their following 14 games in
January. And the season has pretty much

followed this pattern oflose around 10 »

in row, win one and then start losing
again.
So now fans of compellingly awful

sports records have to hope the Nets can
somehow go 1-11, at best, over their last
12 games. It seems mean to root against
the Nets, a harmless franchise that has
never won an NBA title and.can’t shake
out of /the shadow of their somehow
still more dysfunctional neighbor, the
New York Knicks. It wouldn’t be getting
ahead ofyourselfto say the most famous
person involved with the Nets over the
past decade was T] Kidd.

Sure, those who like to'follow records
more positive stories to look to, like the
Connecticut women’s basketball team’s

current winning streak that spans back '

to last season, the longest in collegiate
women’s basketball history.

But there’s something more enter-
taining about rooting for records dem-
onstrating incompetence. That’s why
the first half hour of sports movies are
always the best, when half of the team is
playing a sport for the first time, a few
kids have asthma and they don’t even
have matching uniforms yet. ‘

Plus, when teams or players are pur-
suing records of excellence, we don’t
get scenes’ like the one that took place

factor in that it’s the end of the season,
so a lot of those teams ‘out of playoff

Women hope to learnfrom struggles 

Women’s basketball 4 16

Cole led the Big East in rebounding while
Sims was the leading scorer for the Pan-
thers. » '

The emergence of redshirt junior Brit-
taney Thomas toward the end of the season
was another cause for optimism among the
Panthers. .

After a breakout game off the bench against
Louisville on Feb. 14, Thomas earned a start-
ing position and contributed ﬁve double—digit
scoring performances in the ﬁnal six games
of the regular season.

home opener

little sloppy defensively at the invitational.

The Penguins are currently batting over
.300 as a team. They drove in 11 runs in their
last game, an 11-5 win over Wagner.

The game will be the Panthers’ ﬁnal home
opener at Trees Field, as the team will move
into the Petersen Sports Complex, which is
under construction on upper campus, next
season.

“Brittaney played phenomenally well for
us down the stretch,” Berenato said. “She re-
ally stepped up, and that can all be attributed
to her work ethic and the time she put into
practice.”

That dedication to excellence will hope- _

fully drive the Panthers to achieve their expec-
tations in the coming season as they hope to
learn from the struggles of the past season.
“The bright spot is that we always try to
keep in mind that this is all a growth process,”
Cole said. “We have everyone returning next

year, and we just keep telling each other that
we do not want to let this happen again.”

The Pitt women’s basketball program has ~

grown rapidly since Berenato’s arrival in 2003,

and Berenato recognizes that such a quick as-

cent can pose challenges to her team.

“In the past few seasons, the successcurve
has just shot right up,” Berenato said. “This
year we went down a bit, but it is important
to realize that the players and the staff are
refocused and ready to use.this year’s experi-
ence as motivation for next season.” i
