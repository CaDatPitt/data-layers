bell elaborated his pointwith a
broad. criticism of the campus
organization, its program, and its
administration.

So far, the ranks of the cabinet
have been cut by the removal of
several members who had no
speciﬁc job, and by the consolida-
tion of several posts under a
single director. Two new positions.
have also been created.

Robert Dickson replaced Jim
Cochran as president of the group
and Robert Ingrim took over Lan-
ny Govic’s vacated vice-presi-
dency. Rudy Balaban remains as
secretary.

Glenn Huttenhauer was named
to the newly created post of pub-
lic relations director. Another new
position, religious coordinator, is
unﬁlled at present.

Richard Campbell replaced Bob
Ingrim as chairman of Monday
Lunch. Carl Hagelin joined John
Henderson as co—chairman of the
social c-ommittee. Bert Philippi
was appointed athletic director.

Bob Vogelsang accepted a post
on the Committee of Manage-
ment. His resignation as chairman
of Pitt Town Meeting leaves that
job unoccupied.

Trasher‘ Heads
Election Team

A men’s election committee has
been appointed by Student Con-
gress to prepare for the coming
Men’s Council election, tentative-
ly set for March .31. Gene Trasher,
chairman, Bill Fisher, and ‘John
Rozanski have been chosen from
Student Congress to compose this
committee.

Bob Dickey suggested that Stu-
dent Congress ought to control the
women’s elections. George Lynn
tabled the matter for investiga-

tion. A ’

got under way. Ruth Goldworth,

V

 

chairman of the
Students for Wallace and a coed

at Pitt, secured a loud speaker in

an attempt to offset the expected
audience “participation.”

First indication ot the organ-
ized hackling occurred when a
group of male students sitting at
the top of the hall sang, a‘ parody
on a well-known drinking Song
starting with “Hoorah for Wal-
lace . . .”

Mrs. Goldworth began the rally
by launching an explanation of
Wallace complaints against the
Truman administration, accom-
panied by loud booing and hiss-
ing from the audience. She was
particularly emphatic . on the
dangers of the Marshall planiand
United States’ administered aid
to Turkey and Greece. At one
point she answered the booing
with a cryptic “thank you.”

Pat Eldridge, Pitt senior rose
from the gallery and demanded an

explanation of how the Wallace 1

program would bring peace. Upon
invitation from Mrs. Goldworth,
Pat came down to the speakers’
platform and repeated her ques-
tion. Mrs. Goldworth then refus-
ed to answer, and stated that any
question not answered by the

speakers during the program
would be answered after. the
rally.

Ed Parker, a Pitt student and
the second‘ speaker on the pro-
gram related the adventures of a
Student for Wallace delegation to
Washington which protested to
congressmen about the Universal
Military Training bill. He went.
on to give a breakdown of the bill,
but each time he mentioned UMT
there was loud applause and
cheers.

Steve Rosner, editor of the Dis-
trict 6 United Electrical and Ma-
chine Workers newspaper, “Pro-
gi-ess," was scheduled to speak
next on the program; he waited
quietly by the microphone dur-
ing an uproar from the audience.
Suddenly he pointed with a
sweeping gesture to John Reed,
a Duquesne student in the audi-
ence who was protesting loudly,
and motioned, saying, “Come on
down here. Anyone else who

wants to speak can come down

too.”

Six students reached the stage;
the policestopped the rest of the
onrushing students and made
them return to their seats. When
the tumult had subsided, Rosner
announced that the ‘speakers. for

The episode at Carnegie Lecture Hall last
Monday proved that the large majority of
college students oppose W'a1lace for the presi-
dency of the United States. That’s about all
it proved, politically speaking.

Beyond the realm of the presidential ﬁght,
the “Students for VVallace” meeting _proved
that college students are not as mature as they
think they are. In fact, it proved that college
students are just as “inﬂammable” as any
other mob. .

The editorial board of the News is unani-
mous in its position concerning Henry Wallace
and what it thinks of many of the Wallace
supporters here in the city. We do not feel
that he is presidential material at this date.
We do not condone the Communist backing
that he is getting. '

But," the News feels that the position taken
by college students at that meeting‘ last Mon-
day afternoon was, by far, the most childish
display of actions to-move across the collegiate
calendar in ma.ny years.

It would have been far better if the “orga-
nized dis-ruptors” had tried to organize. Pitt
and, no doubt, Duquesne have thoroughly com-
petent speakers who could have stumped any
of the pro-Wallace speakers seated on the Car-
negie stage. Instead, both schools relied on
the “inﬂamed oratory” of a few daring, but
rankamateurs. Then, the audience refused to
‘pay heed to their own speakers as well as the
Wallace people. A _

If this is an example -of mature,’ objective
thought and action, many thousands of gradu-
ates throughout the country have wasted a

_ good four years. '

or; .  If Continued

Last Week George Lynn, Student Congress
president submitted a report to Congress on
the activities and-- accomplishments of that
group thus far in the school year. The ‘report
aptly’ summarized Congress’ activities and, al-
though rather vague in spots, did hit the high
points.

The progress made by the -congress is not
monumental, but it is deﬁnite and in the right
direction. VVe hope and expect that it will

continue.

We have never maintained that any indiv-
idual congress was at fault for its poor record.
Rather, we realize, and hope that students gen-
erally do, too, that the clear road_ to action
simply has not existed in many cases where
action was imperative. The clearing away of
the obstacles that impede the better function-
ing of Student congress is the biggest job that
faces future congresses.

The present congress by its work in several
important ﬁelds has started the ball rolling.
What it has achieved will be better appreciat-
ed, we believe, when the fruits of its labors
become known- We refer primarily to the
athletic inquiry, the political speakers issue,
the Pitt Chest Plan, and the NSA. If the ball
iskept rolling by future congresses, its mo-
mentum will certainly help to do the much
that remains to be done.

Miss Bucar Found

File
13

. William J. Ca’rrow

On the slim chance that The Pitt News ex-
changes issues with a comparable publication at
the University of Moscow, I’11 submit this eulogy
of Miss Annabelle Bucar and ‘hope that an editor
on the Muscovite sheet will clip my paean and
send it on to her.

The Pitt alum of ’39 received a lot of publicity
in the local press; editorial treatment of her ac-
tivities Was anything but favorable. Disregarding
all aspersions upon her capricious conduct, I,sug-
gest wiring Pitt’s iconoclastic grad a nosegay of
roses.

Greener Pastures
. "On 'Red' Range

The University and the nation might ‘de-
velop more of her breed; she has what is re-
ferred to, in cruder terminology, ‘as A guts. ‘

Under the auspices of the United States Infor-
mation Service, Miss Bucar made the rounds of
Moscow and its environs. She decided she liked
the land of the Cossacks. Having taken a Russian
spouse and renounced all things American, she
announced to the Western world her intentions
of embracing Sovietism with all of its ramiﬁca-
tions.

In contrast to Miss Bucar, scattered sparingly
throughout the United States, are sham citizens
who have experienced no more of Communism in
action than the boisterous Red party meetings in
metropolitan USA, but who, in spite of pro-Rus-
sian aﬁiliationsminuch prefer to remain here among
us decadent capitalists. -

These self-styled Americans now have their
choice of a baker’s dozen of European nations
where they might embrace Communism and
ﬁnd a wealth of idealogical companionship.
They choose, however, a tottering democratic
culture‘ to the enlightenment of applied Com-
munism. - .

In the Russian orbit the wee small voice of
democratic minorities whispers from under op-
pression; here in the United States a rude cabal
propounds, theories alien to the nature-of our land
but welcome in the larger portion of eastern .Eu-
rope. The boys who have the hammer and sickle
seem inclined to cherish their American citizen-
ship and revel in the standard of living nurtured
«by our degenerate democracy.

Pitt’s Annabelle Bucar shatters tradition

. to hell and backin combining political doctrine
and habitat.

So congratulations, Miss Bucar, you’ve vowed‘
Y0u’11 stay in the orbit wher.e Communism (or
the hybrid form of government created‘ by the
Comintern) is practiced. I hope that someday soon
Pitt may_hail-you as the trailblazer for a migra-
tion of minorities. That’ll be the happy day when
misplaced idealists ﬁnd sufficient nerve to go
home.

I am writing the following letter to you concerning the Students
for Wallace rally held in Carnegie Lecture Hall yesterday because

there are several considerations of

primary importance iwhich were,

overlooked by the students attending the rally. I believe that these

considerations should be brought
body.

to the attention of our student

Before I present these considerations, I should like to have it’

understood that I am not one of?
those supporting Wa11ace’s candi-
dacy, nor do I subscribe to many
of his policies.

With this understood, then, I
should like to ask the question,
“WHY WAS THE WALLACE
M E E T I N G SO PURPOSELY
WRECKED?” It has been a fun-
damental belief in this country-_—
regardless of foreign ideologies-
that any and all individuals
possess the right to express their
unhampered by the
group as long as they do notin-
fringe on the rights of the major-
ity to do likewise. '

Accepting this fundamental
American principle, I believe that
there are only two answers possi-
ble to the question which I have
asked. Either we as students are
un-American or we are afraid to
hear the other side. I’m convinc-
ed that very few, if any, of us

would freely admit to the ﬁrst '

answer. All too many ofgus have
fought on the battleﬁelds of this

to hear the other side, because of
the truth which it may express,’
then it is high time that we DO
SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE
instead of indulging in-such stupid
and rather juvenile antics as I

[Investigate Cheating

By Mike Levine and Al Bierman .
As a measure to curb cheating at Pitt, Chancellor Fitzgerald has‘
called for action from a committee of Students and University

   

At the November meeting of the committee it was recognized
“. . . there was a need for a uniform policy with respect to cheating

derstanding of the aspects of the
problem on the part of both stu-
dents and faculty.”

The Deans’ Committee has ask-
ed Men's Council forthe aid oi
that student group and was given
the support of nine men students
to work with the committee.

According to University faculty
‘members and oﬂicials, cheating
has become widespread through-
out the school until it has reached
proportions greater than ever be-
fore.‘Practice of giving F5 to stu-
dents caught cheating has failed to
decrease the practice.

It is expected that punitive
measures to be taken in the fu-
ture will be extremely severe.

Many departments have been
using proctors during examina--
tions leading to animosity among
both students and faculty. This
system, has only slightly phased
the mischief.

“An honor system would be dif-
ﬁcult to install and enforce in an
institution the size of Pitt,” one
faculty member said.

“It places too great a respon--
sibility upon the individuals,
many of whom just don’t have the
feeling (for their alma mater) to
carry out the job.”

Members of the Deans’ Com-
mittee are: H. S. Longnecker,‘
Graduate school; V. W. Lanfear,
Business Administration; S. P.
Franklin, Education; E. A. Hol-
brook, Engineering and Mines;
and chairman S. C. Crawford,
‘ Dean of the College.

Robert Chapman, Robert Dickson,

Military Ball
Has 3 Bands.

Entire Floor

For the ﬁrst time since 1942 a
Pitt dance will feature three bands
and will occupy the entire 17th
ﬂoor‘ of the William Penn Hotel.

The 1948 Military Ball next
Friday, will feature Vaughn Mon-
roe and his nationally famous or-
chestra, assisted by Bill LeRoy’s
well known Pittsburgh dance band
and an unannounced six piece
combo. -

Schaughency and business man-
ager Bob Anderson this week re-
vealed the names of the 1948 Mili-
tary Ball committee heads. They
are: William B. Lamb, advertis-
ing chairman; William Focer, mu-
sic chairman; Edward J. Lamb,
invitations; James J . Scannell, Jr.,
decorations; William M. Katz, pro-
grams; 'and Bill Raines, press
chairman.

The dance_committee wishes to
remind students that the Military

allow Vaughn Monroe ample time
to board an early morning train
for Chicago.

The Military Ball is open to all
Pitt students, veterans and non-
veterans alike. A limited number
of tickets still tire available at the
activities booth on the ground
ﬂoor of the Cathedral. Price of

‘five dollars includes federal and

city taxes.

 

Tour of South
Made by Prof

Mr. Edwin Peterson, associate
professor in the English depart-
ment has just completed a two
week tour of the smaller colleges
in the south.

Sponsored by the Association of
American Colleges, Mr. Peterson
visited Mary Washington College,
a branch 01; the University of Vir-
ginia in Fredericksburg, Virginia;
Roanoke Cillege in Salem, Vir-
ginia; Emory and Henry College
in Emory, Virginia; and Salem
College in Winston Salem, North
Carolina.

Mr. Peterson did everything
from lecture to large groups, to
teaching freshman English classes.
He spent a minimum of two days
at every college he visited.

The purpose of the tour was to
give students in the small colleges
the beneﬁt of hearing and working
with the instructors in the larger
schools.

With the exception of last year,
when he was unable to go, Mr.
Peterson has been making these
tours for the last ﬁve years.

Debaters Seek.
State Laurels

Pitt’s debaters take on 27 Penn-
sylvania colleges for the state
championship in the Intercollegi-
ate Debate tournament today and
tomorrow at Allegheny College.

Discussing the question, “World
Federal Government Should be
Established,” David Rhodes and
Richard Moskowitz will present
the aﬂirmative and Franklin
Blackstone and Mary Green will
argue negative.

This is the Pennsylvania Debate
association’s annual tournament.
Pitt’s team did not participate in
last year’s competition.

John Rosanski was to compete
in the Pennsylvania State Oratory
contest in the same competition
but was unable to make proper
preparations because of last
Week’s athletic controversy.

In Season Finae

_ By Donald Gifﬁn

Forty—three’home games ago Pitt dropped down to Morgantown
for a basketball game and whipped West Virginia, 60-57. A small
Panther, by name Bill Cieply, paced the winners that evening in
1944 with 22 points.

Tomorrow night the Ice Cream Eaters hie off to the hills again
and Bill Cieply will be going for¢
the last time. He and  (Lefty)
Latagliata wind up their collegi-

To Take Stand on Policies

 Of Ai-hiefic‘ Director Hagan

By John Golightly T

Tuesday the curtain goes up on Act Three of Pitt’s comic‘

opera presentation, “Committees of 1948.” This skit will fol-
low the general theme and feature a report by the Board of
Trustees’ Committee. I think it is time to drop the curtain-—

on what may yet be a ﬁasco—and get down to basic issues.
Firing James Hagan and keep-¢

 

Maybe their team-mates will
give them a big sendoﬁ with a
victory. But the odds are stack-
ed heavily against them. Since
the Pitts pulled that upset in
1944, the Mountianeers haven’t
disappointed the Morgantown fans
by losing at home.

Now Lee Patton’s passers, after
suﬁering three unexpected de-
feats early in the campaign are
rolling along with an eight—game
winning streak and a possible
pust—season tournament bid.

They built their prospects up a
little higher last Saturday when
they tripped high-ﬂying Bradley
Tech, 85-74.

While the Mountaineers were
trimming Bradley, Pitt posted a
victory oved Westminster, 58-54,
to close the home season and bal-
ance the record again with ten
decisions on both sides of the
scale.

been with Pitt 19 years, and since
Dr. John B. (Jock) Sutherland’s
exodus in 1938, has served faith-
fully as the University “whipping
boy.” Last fall, however, the Let-
termen’s Club gave him a vote of
conﬁdence. '

At the time, the Club quite
frankly said there is no evidence
that James Hagan is responsible
for Pitt’s unfortunate athletic sit-
uation. ’ '

Alumni Remain Silent

I have heard no ofﬁcial disap-
proval from the organized alumni
concerning their relations with
Hagan. Prior to 1938—when Pitt

was a football powerhouse-——,l be- -

lieve our relations with district
high schools were about the same
as they are now.

I do know that Hagan, as grad-
uate manager of athletics, con-
tacted and sc-outed the high
school players who eventually
came to Pitt. Obviously when his
job requires contacting high
school players, he can. But is this
one of his duties as athletic direc-
tor or has he been told to do oth-
erwise?

I think decency requires that
someone in the administration,
certainly Chancellor Fitzgerald,
go on record as approving or dis-
approving the policies of James
Hagan as director of athletics.

No A one in the administration
has ever officially expressed dis-

approval. The Chancellor should .

clarify the position of his em-
ployees.

I am not condemning the Stu-

'gators._ They volunteered for a

difﬁcult task, and their recom-
mendations were speciﬁc al-
though, I believe, they ignored
‘many facts.

One lesson must be, learned
from this pyramiding of confu-
sion. The Chancellor, as an ad-
ministrator, must f'ully deﬁne the
authority of the athletic director.
He must set up. a clear cut ath-
letic policy, and he must make
it public.

The suspicion and behind—the-
scenes activities, which have
characterized athletics at the Uni-
versity, must be exposed, and,
more important, eliminated.

The February air was chilly and damp and the Pittsburgh

Pirates were still packing theilé
traveling bags. But Mitterling had
his pitchers and catchers wrapped
up in sweat suits and ﬂinging
away.

The training camp of the Pan-
thers is a far cry from Hollywood
or Miami —— and not just geo-
graphically. It is a makeshift bull-

far, he has limited them to loose
throwing so as to limber up their
arms.

Seventeen pitchers and ‘eight
catchers make up the crew. Of
these, three hurlers and two catch-
ers are holdovers from last year’s
team: _

Pitt Wrestlers

Meet Tartan,
Mat Champs

Unattached wrestling champs
of Pitt and Carnegie Tech meet
Wednesday at Tech gym in the
ﬁrst of two sets of mat matches.
The following Wednesday, March
17, they will stage the second half
of the competitions at Trees gym.

The elimination touney last
week decided Pitt’s representa-
tives for these IM dual wrestling
struggles. ‘Under the supervision
of Leo C. Bemis, intramural di-
rector, top men in six weight
groups and several alternates
carry Pitt’s colors against the Tar-
tan grunters.

Several former WPIAL and

LAAU champs stud the Panther
‘squad. Richard Abraham, Canons-

burg junior, displayed the form
that won Senior AAU and WPIAL
titles as he outclassed the opposi-
tion in the 135-pound class.
Two former WPIAL semi—ﬁnal-
ists tangled in the ﬁnal muscle
tussel of the Pitt eliminations.
John Prezioso, a Dormont high
product, took the 128-pound
crown by pinning Robert Cole in

,a minute and 12 seconds of the

third period. Cole got his mat
training as a member of West
View high’s team.

Dean Woodcock, another West
View high grad, waded through
a strong ﬁeld to earn the 158-
pound title. Woodstock squeezed
out a 9-8 victory over Marico Pe-
luso, ex-Schenley high groaner,
in the class ﬁnals. Peluso may
compete in the two—school
matches.
