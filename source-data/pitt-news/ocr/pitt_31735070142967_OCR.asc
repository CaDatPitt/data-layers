Fans remember glory days of Pirates, Mazeroski

Green Tree native Herbert Soltrnan

remembers Oct. 13, 1960, like it was ~

yesterday.

It’s the bottom of the ninth, score
tied at nine all. A batter takes the plate
with tension thick in the air.

V With second baseman Bill Maze-
rosl<i’s historic home run, the Pirates
won the World Series with a 10-9 vic-
tory over the New York Yankees.

“People were jumping, hugging,
kissing— and thatwaswith complete
strangers,” said Soltman, who recalled
leaping from his $7.70 ﬁrst-baseline

. seats to storm Forbes Field in celebra-

tion. “It was just absolutely crazy. Ab-

It was there that fans, parked in
lawn chairs and sporting throwback
Pirates jerseys, enjoyed free food and
cheered along with the original radio
broadcast. ‘

And for many Pirates enthusiasts,
the broadcast brought back fond
memories of the unforgetiable World
Series win..

The series had been tied, with the
Pirates and Yankees winning three

But while the Yankees wins had
been decisive —— 16-2, 10-0, 12-0 ——
the Pirates never managed more than

1960’s World Series still hits it home for ‘Game 7Gan

World Series< 2

Garne7ofthe series, however,was aback-and-
forth game that saw zero strikeouts —— arare sta-
tistic —with Mazeroski decidingthe victory with
a soaring home run inthe ﬁnal Pirates at bat.

Though the Pirates would go on to win an-
other World Series in 1979, the 1960 victory was
historic for fans.

Dickjones, a‘68 Pittalumnus fromNorth Hills,
attended Mazeroski Day with a group of his fra-
ternity brothers. ,

“I can remember this like it was yesterday,
honest to God,” he said, over the crowd. ‘

Jones said the radio broadcastreminded him
of ninth grade, when he sneaked a transistor ra-
dio intoclassto listentothegame. Hisplanwas
foiled when the teacher spotted the radio and
conﬁscated it.

But  of keeping the radio, Jones said,
the teacher did the unthinkable.

“He said, flones — come back here and mm

it up so we can all hear it,”’ he said. “I would have .

died had they not won this game, I think.”

Also amongthose gathered at Mazeroski Day
were Enos and Irene Abel of Moon Township.

Forthe couple, Oct. 13, 1960, is morethanthe
dateof a historic baseball game —— itwas also the
day they met. ‘

After work, the then-27-year-old Enos was in
a carwith his friends, headingto an Oakland bar
to celebrate the baseballwin.

He wasn’t pleased when the car stopped to
pick up Irene, then 24.

“I said, ‘We have enough! We don’t need any

more people in the,car,”’ he recalled with alaugh. Z
» .“Was it love atﬁist sight? No.”

was over.”

“Boy, what awild time itwas,” she said. _

George Skornickel, a member of the Game 7
Gang, said Mazeroski Day has grownthroughout
the years.

The ﬁrst celebraﬁon was an informal one, he
recalls: Just a casual fan club with one member

sporting a boom box and the broadcast tape.

“We just showedup,” he said. “We decided we
wantto make sure to keep it going.”

Fourteen years later, Skornickel said the plan-
ning process remains informal.

But the long-time Pirates fan — who owns

morethan 250 autographs ﬁom members of the
1960team——saidthe eventis so meaningfulthat
he takes personal days from workto attend.

“It really doesn’t take that much to get it to-
gether, but it always turns out as a nice even ”
he said.

Soltman said that members ofthe Game7Gang
armually organize the event through informal
e—maﬂ and telephone meetings.

The planning process, which begins injuly,
involves bookingthe tent at Schenley Plaza and a
speaker system from the Pittsburgh Parks Con-
servancy, organizing food sponsorship from the

Katz School of Business and contacting former
Pirates with invitations to the event.

While afewmembers ofthePirates1960 World
Seriesteam—- includingpitcher Bob Friend— at-
tended the event, headliner Mazeroski did not.

Soltman said he hopes Mazeroski will make
an appearance next year to mark the 50th an-
niversary of the game, as he did in 1990 for the
40th anniversary celebration.

But he was not surprised by Mazeroskfs ab-
sence yesterday.

“He’s just that humble,” he said. “Very low-
key.” '

Editorial

Apathy no excuse
to not vaccinate

hen it comes to health
concerns, college stu-
dents tend to think

they’re invulnerable. Concerning
the H1N1 virus, many students
probably think it won’t happen to
them. Now that Pitt has received
1,200 doses of the H1N1 nasal
spray, students should take ad-
vantage of them.

The number of cases at Pitt
have declined —— the number of-
students with se1f—reported ﬂu-like
illnesses averaged ﬁve per day as
of earlier this month — but the
illness subsists amid our campus
and community. Perhaps some
students will avoid the vaccine
because they fear such a rushed
medication could have unstudied
detrimental side effects.

It’s a personal choice for most
students, but regardless of their
reasoning, students shouldn’t
avoid the vaccine because of an

apathetic or invulnerable disposi-
tion‘. After all, college campuses —
particularly dorms and cramped
classrooms — are all too condu-
cive to spreading illnesses.

We’re in the middle of mid-
terms, and the workload often
consumes the majority of our time.
Sure, the college lifestyle doesn’t
cater to free time, but students
shouldn’t let everyday humdrum
impede on something as important
as getting vaccinated.

The number of doses Pitt has
received is small in comparison
to the size of Pitt's student body.
Over the coming weeks, Pitt should
receive more vaccines, though they
might be small portions.

We encourage students to reg-
ister promptly for a vaccine. And
as college students are notoriously
frugal, thankfully the University
has made the vaccines free to Pitt
students.

Lewis Lehe Endorses Things,

Warmth and Wonder in every Pitt shuttle ride

 
 
  

Lewis Lehe
Columnist

 

This column begins a series about
things I endorse and why I endorse
them. ’

Today, I endorse the Pitt shuttle
system. "

What can rival the joy that blooms
when, after several minutes of
standing alone in the cold with an
uncharged iPod, you at last discern
the shuttle’s chubby face coming
‘round the bend?

As the shuttle door swings open,
it is surprising to see a driver behind
it all.

In my mind, the shuttle is a sen-
tient being. Hufﬁng and panting
over the cracked blacktop of Oak-
land, he is eager to help his friends,
the humans. He does not want slush
to numb their delicate, pink human
feet.

In fact, nothing gives him more-

pleasure than to restore us with a den
of warmth and safety, like a cozy log
cabin roving far and wide across the
land, perhaps built by Abe Lincoln
himself. That is how I fancy he fan-
cies himself.

Maybe the shuttle is a she,
though. I guess there’s nothing to
stop a woman from being a bus.

The fun has just begun, though.
Through those squeaky glass doors
is a cast of characters you’ll never
forget. It’s like the TV show “Cheers,”
except no one knows your name,
because you never talk to one an-
other.

But you wouldfor sure fraternize
grandly if the shuttle had abar. Beer
is sort of an unfair advantage that
“Cheers” has over the Pitt shuttle
system, and I would endorse any

‘ measures to "close the disparity.

Beer or no beer, you are all com-
rades, if not acquaintances. You are
in this thing together. Whenever
something weird or funny happens
to the shuttle as awhole — old wom-
en arguing in the road or a hostage
crisis, for example — the shuttle is
soon abuzz with comment, as if the
passengers were old union men in a

barber shop.

It is this subterranean camarade-
rie that makes the shuttle system a
jewel in the crown of civilization. A
jewel restored at long last!

A beautiﬁil quality of our grand-
parents’ generation was the capacity
to do anything with total strangers,
except have sex. Back then, atypical
American man would hitchhike, ﬁx
a truck, shower, play_]ew’s harp and
shoot at the Axis powers with fellows

whose ﬁrst names he did not know
— all in one day. . ,
Nowadays, unless the draft or the

parish system make a comeback, the I

shuttle is a rare chance to course with
a random sample of the Pitt student

body. It forces us to look at our neigh— »
bors up close —— in total innocence :*
— just looking at them and making 
observations, because we’re bored A ,.

and therefore curious:

this?”

“The dude who once told a knee-
slapping hilarious story on his cell
phone is taking out his cell phone.
Will he repeat the achievement?”

“The Mexicans are speaking
Spanish again. I want to signal that
I speak Spanish, too, so I can look
smart. Maybe I should laugh at that

joke, but it wasn’t actually ﬁinnyg:
enough for me to laugh without 
being obvious that I just laughed 

show I understood  Mierda!” -

 
  

The shuttle ride even has an epi-
logue that leaves the heart as warm
asjune.  _ . .
J st when youthought the fun
supp y was done, as you alight, the
driver tells you to have a nice day. He
does so with adegree of sincerity that

, is amazing, given the number of nice

days he bids in an eight-hour shiﬁz.

In return, every rider thanks the
shuttle driver. Asimple “thanks” suf-
ﬁces. It is not necessary to read the
poem Walt Whitman wrote about
Pitt shuttle drivers called “Oh Cap-
tain! My Captain!” inunisonwith the
other riders, for example. 

_ But as forced and awkward as
it might seem, trading thanks is a
moment of shared humanity rare
outside of an underdog sports 
That is whatthe shuttle is all about:
bringing people «together. And ‘also

EOTO electrifies stage with improv and and dance

Larissa Gula
Staﬁ" Writer

Think about the most memorable
dance party you’ve ever been to.

Now imagine being in a band
whose goal is to make every perfor-
mance like that party, but better.

EOTO is the electro-house-
dance music project of former
members of The String Cheese
Incident, Jason Hann and Michael
Travis. The band uses live perfor-
mance, improvisation and elec-
tronic music.

“It’s 100 percent improvised
music, and it’s all live,” Hann said,
“and it’s all being created in front
of the audience. It’s a combination
of DJ with all-electronic music that
ﬂows from one song into the next,
but there’s also musicianship go-
ing on.”

Performing every night can be
exhausting and stressful, but Hann
believes it has helped him and his

band partner Travis develop their

historical ﬁgures,” Murray said.

This includes the powerful Henry
Clay Frick and Roberto Clemente, he
said.

“[We] learned Pittsburghis anab-
solute treasure trove of great stories
— stories that few people are telling
nowadays, because there just isn’t a
venue for it,” Murray said. “We de-
cided to start Hatmted Pittsburgh to
ﬁll the void.”

According to Murray, Haunted
Pittsburgh stands out ﬁom haunted
houses in its style and message.

“We are more akin to historians
and storytellers as opposed to para-
normal investigators,” he said. “We
focus on the ghost stories themselves
and the history and tradition that sur-
round the stories.”

Hatmted Pittsburgh uses the South
Side neighborhoodforitswalkingtour
and dinners. It’s impossible to have
tourslin every neighborhood with
ghost stories, but the South Side has
its beneﬁts.

“South Side is unique because of
its big population and heavy concen-

performance skills.

“The best part  is playing night
after night after night,” Hann said.
“We constantly get better because
it’s a stretch to do something dif-
ferent. The same thing gets boring.
The hard part is trying to inject new
energy.”

These all-night jam sessions

‘ began between the two just for

fun. Since then, their roots have
heavily inﬂuenced their goal as a
performance group.

“We started out playing for

tration of mid-19th-century homes
and  because of its sheer vitality,”
Murray said.

“Ifyou’re lookingfor ghost stories,
ironically enough, you usually have
to go where there’s a lot of life, and
in Pittsburgh, thafs South Side,” he
said.

In Pittsburgh, history and ghost
tales will always include the old steel
industry that gave Pittsburgh its nick-
name, “The Steel City.”

“South Side was a steel mill neigh-
borhood,” Murray said. ‘Themills are
imprinted on our town’s DNA, and
they provide for some creepy ghost
tales. Pittsburgh has famously been
called ‘hell with the lid off.’ Our city’s
characterwas forged in vicious labor
strife and in pig—iron furnaces so hot
that men and women sometimes for-
get their fear of hell. Any town that
has lived through the turbulence and
tumult we’ve experienced can’t escape
its ghosts.”

These days, the friendly atmo-
sphere in some restaurants allows
introductions to other people in the

hours on end with no real agenda,
just to have fun,” Hann said. “It
slowly morphed into being able
to [play] . . . music for hours at a

time. It was much more fun than .

trying to put songs together on a
computer. Much more fun to go out
there with a blank slate and have
the audience go through the same
thing with us.”

Three years later, the pair
stopped performing privately and
spent all their time on the road.

They want to perform abroad as '

well, Hann said.

They also performed with other
groups in various genres.

“The fun part about interacting
is that it makes us play a little bit
[differently],” Hann said. “If we
collaborate, then there’s a meeting
halfway and something new comes
out of it. It’s just nice to have some-
thing different to play.”

But they still love their home-
town, Boulder, Colo.

“There was definitely a fol-

community, includingparanormalbe—
lievers and real-life mediums, Murray
said. He added thatthere is a medium
who regularly attends the ghostwalks
and dinners.

“People are naturally curious, and

 

they love to ponder mysteries,” Mur-
ray said. “There is no greater mystery
thanwhat lies beyond. Our ghost tour
and dinner taps into that curiosity. In-
terest in what lies beyond predates
recorded history. It really comes down
to personal belief — religion grapples
with these questions, andwe’d deferto
the theologians on these matters.”
People might struggle with the an-
swers, but perhaps the answers are
best left alone for now. It lends more

. lowing there that we wouldn’t
have been able to go national [so
quickly] without,” Hann said.

There’s room for vocals at their

_ jams, aswell.

“The good thingforus is thatpeo-

just lookingto us to give themanhour

about PitIsburgh’s great history.”

Haunted Pittsburgh’s tour guide
is historianjames “Woody” Cunning-
ham, atrue raconteur. Hehas donehis

thing special about Pittsburgh.
“What makes [Pittsburgh] differ-
ent from most [cities] that I’ve been
to is that the more research you do
into it, the more true they seem to be,”

Cunningham said.

True or not, tours do not guarantee
a ghost sighting. This is story time.
Cunningham still warns any non-be-

lievers on the tour: “Ifyou don’t like ',

cats, thefll sit onyour lap. It seems to

be the same thing with ghosts.”

English.”

For a band that relies so heav-
ily on improvisation, recording
albums would seem like a chal-
lenge.

66

It’s a feeling between
just drums, dancers
and energy in the

moment.
Jason Hann

“The studio is basically how we
perform live, but when we perform
live, we basically transition from
song to song to song and don’t
stop,” Hann said. “[In the studio]
we press record and we just go for
it and use whatever we record. If
we perform 10 minutes, we might
take four to ﬁve and use that as our
song.”

But the difference between the
recording and the live performance
is clear to Hann.

“It’s deﬁnitely almost ceremo-
nial and communal in the fact that
we don’t know what we’re going to
play, and it develops a relationship
throughout the night,” he said. “It’s
a feeling between just drums, danc-
ers and energy in the moment. It’s
satisfying to feel that in the room.
That moment will only happen that
way that particular night.”

Lengthy studio work may not be
for EOTO, but it’s not a bad thing.

“That’s just a whole other art
form to be in the studio and cre-
ate a song with different parts,’i.¢»
Hann said. “I have much respect
for producers that go in there. I
also do that on my off-time. -

“I have done it for a long time.
But for live, it is far more satisfying
to feel you can go with a blank pal-
ette and begin creating something
and create it on a level that strives
to be as in—depth as a producer in
the studio with all the time in the
world.”

Dickerson, Pitt’s leading receiver

Adams notches 100th career win as Panthers

Diana Connorl SENIO STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
The Pitt women’s.tennis team has one match left in its fall season.

 

 

Evan Burgos
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Elizabeth Adams became the fastest
tennis player to 100 wins in Pitt his-
tory by going4—2 at the Old Dominion
Collegiate Invitational. 1 '

The junior won the singles con-
solation bracket and teamed with
senior Shannon Benic to make the
semiﬁnals of the doubles main draw.
After traveling to Norfolk, Va., for
the invitational, the Panthers are
two-thirds ﬁnished with their fall
schedule.

In the quarterﬁnals, Adams and
Benic beat the tournament’s No. 1
seed, AlexBaraand]oseﬁn Hjertquist
of Virginia Commonwealth, in a tie-
breaker 9-8 (3).The pairingfell 8-3 in
the semis to Delaware’s Ivana Petrich
and Montserrat Ripoll, but still im-
pressed.

“[It was] one of the best perfor-
mances I’ve seen two players make
in a Pitt uniform,” coach George Dief-
fenbach said. “They played aggressive
and consistent. They played a good
combination of offense and defense,
which is what good doubles teams
do. We expect great leadership from

compete in their fall schedule

them. They have a lot experience.” . '

The freshman doubles tandem of
Gabi Cantanzariti and Karma Parbhu
and partners Adela Aprodu and Minh
Evans also recordedwins in the main
draw.

Dieffenbach said hewas satisﬁed
with his team’s results and cited the
heightened competition of the invita-
tional, compared to the tournament
at West Point in which the Panthers
participated one week prior.

The team will wrap up its fall
schedule at the ITAtoumamentfrom
Oct. 23-27.

“We got conﬁdence, and every-
body recorded some wins and they
came back a better team,” he said.
“It’1l be a good test for them at the ITA
tourney. That’s very strong. Therewill
be some tremendous talent there.

“I would be very pleased to get to
the quarters in singles and quarters
in doubles in that tournament. Then,
we can start to challenge for Eastern
division rankings, possible national
rankings.”

The teamwill have several months
off from competition until match and
conference play commence in early
February.

The team has yet to set an official

ladder butwill start‘ challenge match-
es before the spring season. For now,
Adams ﬁgures to be the squad’s No. 1
singles player and will team up with
Benic to form No. 1 doubles.

In the spring, the team will have
to factor in the now—injured Sabrina
Visram, a senior, who was the team’s
No. 2 singles anddoubles player be-
fore tearing her ACL last winter.

Visram’s return, combined with
Adam’s steady play, provides reason
for optimism heading into the spring
season, but Dieffenbach remains
modest in setting team goals.

Coming off a year when the Pan-
thers ﬁnished tied for seventh in the
Big East, Dieffenbach said he hopes
to ﬁnish in the top ﬁve this year. He’d
also like to ﬁnish with a winning re-
cord in the Big East and in overall
record.

To ﬁnish in the top ﬁve in the
conference standings, the team will
compete against schools who offer
full athletic scholarships to all players
— something Pitt does not.

Dieifenbach expressed doubtﬁil
sentiments.

“Those top ﬁve teams in the Big
Eastare allﬁill scholarships,” he said.
“We’ll do our best, though.”
