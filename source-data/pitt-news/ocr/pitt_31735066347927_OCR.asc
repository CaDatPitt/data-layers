Bayard Residents /Contemplote

Legal Action Against Greeks

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL
Last summer, Vice Chancellor
for Student Affairs Alfred Moye
warned fraternities with neighbor

. problems, most of which centered

around Bayard Street, that if the
Greeks didn’t patrol their own
ranks and improve relations, they
would suffer unpleasant penalties.

This summer, agitated Bayard
Street residents are preparing-
without publicity——to rectify what
they see as an unsolved situation
by taking the alleged offenders to
court, if necessary.

A group of Bayard residents,

“the situation” for as many as 23

years, has contacted a law ﬁrm and

is preparing “possibly to seek an
injunction if the situation does not
clear up soon,” according to one
long-time resident.

“We have an attorney, but we
haven’t asked him to proceed with
the case as yet,” the resident said.
So much of it depends on the
actions in the near
future—all we ask is they act as
responsible citizens of this neigh-
borhood. A

“We’ve tried to work through
University channels,” the resident
added. “We’re reasonable people,

Housecleaning Time

The Bayard Street community-fraternity conflict, whose
history is longer and more vivid than either side should care to
remember, is rapidly approaching a point at which extinction"
of one side—probably the Greek—is assured. But, through
some intelligent and unprecedented policing action by the In-
terfraternity Council (IFC), this point of no return can be

"averted.

The case boils down to this: Several Bayard Street frater-
nities, forgetting they reside in_a semi-quiet neighborhood,
have engaged in conduct unbecoming a 3-year-old. And some
neighbors, understandably, have become upset to the point
they are considering legal action. And the fraternities, for the
most part, have done) nothing to clean their own houses
(figuratively as well as literally, of course). ,

If conditions and behavior do not improve, IFC can expect
its Bayard members to be hit with a lawsuit that will take
membership control ‘out of its hands and transfer. that
authority to a judge and the injunction-armed residents.

A healthy fraternity system is a beneficial facet of any
campus, and we hope such a system will be a part of Pitt. But

that will happen only if the IFC is willing to control its mem-
bers——and the sanctions should be heavy, including removal.

of charters, if necessary———and only when Bayard Street re-

turns to being a neighborhood of responsible residents of all

ages. We hope effective measures are employed in this case
p before it becomes a moot point as far as a judge is concerned"

efforts don’t seem to pay ~off—the

Director of Student Activities
Williard “Bud” Heaps said yester-
"day his office has received
numerous complaints «concerning
fraternity behavior. He said the
University has not been informed
of any legal action contemplated by
residents.

Several fraternity members are
aware of the neighbors’ potential
trip to court, though none would
comment. '

Residents have contacted at-
torney Lawrence Kaplan, the Pitt
News has learned, and have asked
him to investigate the possibility of
an injunction. “We also have
discussed seeking monetary
damages,” one resident said.

“It all boils down to the

University not providing adequate V

student housing and activities,” a.
resident said. “So they come to
fraternities to let off steam. I guess
if I were a student, I would, too.
“But that is what leads to the
problem here, and there are
problems,” he added. “No one
can understand what goes on

Remember the terror and havoc
“The Exorcist” wreaked on petri-
ﬁed American moviegoers four
years ago—renewing or starting in
many people a curious interest in
the occult and supernatural?

If you were one of the millions
who experienced a sleepless night,
tossing and turning, contemplating”
the bizarre demonic possession in
the first “Exorcist,” the new ﬁlm,
“Exorcist II: The Heretic,” might
bring back some unpleasant dreams
and memories.

However, it won’t scare you like

I the first one.

A good, but choppy ﬁlm, “The
Heretic” runs into the old problem
of a sequel trying to top the parent
blockbuster and all the inevitable
comparisons which are made

3‘ between the two.

At times the film is gripping; but
the plot takes too long to develop,_
and--although visually exciting-
the ending is a letdown and
somewhat confusing.’

This time around, Regan (Linda
Blair) is four years older and rapidly
developing into a buxom 17-year-
old teen-ager.

Regan is going to a clinic in New
York, trying to discover through
psychoanalysis V with Dr. Tuskin

_%(Louise Fletcher), what exactly

happened to her in that wretched
ordeal four years ago in Washing-
ton.

Fletcher plays her role well and
you probably won’t miss Regan’s
mother (Ellen Burstyn) from “The
Exorcist.” In the “Heretic,” she’s
supposedly on location making a
ﬁlm, while Regan is once again_

*9 taken care of by the neurotic Sharon

(Kitty Winn).

The most noteworthy addition to
the cast is Richard Burton’s
portrayal of Father Lamont, a Jesuit
assigned from Rome by Cardinal
J aros (Paul Henreid), to ﬁnd out the
whereabouts of the old exorcist
Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow).

He goes to Washington and talks
to Regan and even employs
T.uskin’s memory machine to get
inside her mind to relive the horror
with her.

Although the demon Bismallah
was supposedly exorcised in
Washington by the dead Father
Karas (Jason Miller), Lamont ﬁnds
Regan has the power to heal, as

illustrated by Regan getting an-

autistic girl to speak. These healing
powers show that the demon is still
trying to possess her.

William Goodheart’s screenplay
uses several chilling ﬂashbacks
from the ﬁrst ﬁlm and expands the
story confusingly to Africa, where
Lamont learns of Father Meri-in’s
death.

. ’ While in Africa against the order
of his superiors in Rome, Lamont
ﬁnds a holy man, old Kokomo '

(James Earl Jones), who is immune
to the demon. Kokomo gives
Lamont the knowledge and courage

_to take Regan to Washington to do

battle with, and triumph good over
evil in the ﬁnal building crumbling,
blood curdling and technically.
exciting scene. ,

For Burton, “The Heretic” is
perhaps the shot in the arm his
career needs. Instead of making
headlines. with his new wife Susan
Hunt, and 4.his.'»e‘ld--wife. Elizabeth
Taylor; this film- shows what a great
actor he really is.

Fletcher’s portrayal of a working
woman doctor, divorced and with
two young children at home, is

 “Mary Hartman”
Leaves The Tube

By PATTY TASCARELLA

It seems appropriate that this
year which marked the final episode
of f‘The Mary Tyler Moore Show,”
should be the one in which “Mary
Hartman, Mary Hartman” bows
out.

Just as Moore’s Mary Richards
was the epitome of the all-American
dream girl, Louise Lasser’s Mary
Hartman was the perfect charica-
ture of the all too typical consumer
who buys that dream right down to
the waxy yellow buildup on the
kitchen ﬂoor.

“Mary Hartman” was the brain

9 child of television innovator Nor-

9

man Lear. The setting was
Femwood, Ohio and the plot was
the usual soap opera ﬁascos—all
served up with a healthy dose of
satire.

Lasser’s Mary, a pigtailed
housewife with a vacant Orphan
Annie stare, was plunged into a

series of calamities from the show’ s L

onset. Husband Tom was having an
affair, Grandpa Larkin was arrested
for ﬂashing, Mary was kidnapped
by a mass murderer whose victims
included “the entire Lombardi
family, three goats and six
chickens,” and the list goes on.
There was competent acting by
most of the cast and an exceptional
job by Mary Kay Place as Loretta,
Mary’s best friend who was on the
‘verge of country western stardom.
When one of her more moronic

""“ songs propelled her from singing

part time in the Capri Lounge

bowling alley to a performance on
the “Dinah Shore Show,” Loretta

blew it all by making an antisemitic

remark on live television. While
commenting on the helpfulness of a

member of Dinah’s staff, she

chirped, “And it’s hard to believe

that them’s the people what killed

our Lord.”

During the ﬁrst year, the writing
was of far higher quality despite
leaning towards sight, gags.
Probably the highlight came when a
man drowned in a bowl of Mary's
chicken soup. Giving Mary a highly
publicized nervous breakdown to
kick off the second season, the plot
began moving at a dizzying pace
and tried to encompass too many
trendy ideas. As with most Lear
shows, it -had also‘ outlived its
usefulness.

But in its prime, “Mary
Hartman’ ’ was all too often so funny
that it hurt—and the pain came
from the realization there is a little
Mary Hartman in all of us.

compassionate, admirable and
believable. ‘

Blair, with not that much
experience behind her, is still a
fairly wooden actress; but has a very
sexy, naive stage presence that’s
purringly effective.

Von Sydow is used only in
ﬂashbacks; but be, along with Blair,
is needed for audience identiﬁca-

John Boorman’s direction, like

the screenplay, is a bit jumbled and

’ flat. which keeps the movie from

Circus Improvises Through City

By SEPTEMBER LEE

They are serious actors and

actresses who, literally, are clown-

ing around this summer. As part of
the newly formed vaudeville
touring company, The Instant City
Circus, six theatre graduates and
undergraduates from local uni-
versities are taking a breather from
more serious winter performances,
improvising their way through a
summer of vaudeville bookings.

Sponsored by the city’s Depart-
ment of Parks and Recreation, the
professional acting troupe will
perform rambunctious comedy in
city parks and neighborhood
festivals through August for the
enjoyment of young and older.

The troupe travels light; their act
is portable. Besides a backdrop
depicting the Golden Triangle in
bold, primary colors, their set is
anyone’s imagination, outlined by
skillful mime gestures. Their script
is fast-moving improv; lines borrow
heavily from old vaudeville classics

    
  
    
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
  

 

and were polished in two_ weeks of
concentrated rehearsal time.

‘ And it’s show time! But how do
the six company members, who
have been visible in many local
professional productions and who
between them have racked up
acting credits from coast to coast,
feel about doing vaudeville in the
parks?

Former Pitt student Tredessa
Dalton, who performed in Pitt
professor Atillio Favorini’s histori-
cal documentary “Stel City” at the
Smithsonian Institute in Washing-
ton D.C., said it’s ‘.‘ good exercise”
in creativity.‘

“It helps you to be able to use
the environment and people around
you to be creative,”. said the young
black woman, who plans to return
to formal theatre work in the fall.
“lt’s different working without a
set script. You have to constantly
be thinking of things to make it
interesting. ’ ’

Dalton said vaudeville is a
different kind of comedy than the
stage comedies she had performed
in. “It’s really challenging. It
