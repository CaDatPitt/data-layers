Meeting On Green Marks Time
Before ‘Approaching Elections

 

L It may have been the warm spring
evening or it might have been the
surr_oundings of blue sky and soft

-. green grass of the Faculty Club
lawn, where studentcouncil had its
meeting Wednesday evening, but
whateverit was council. achieved
some deﬁnite measures. without the
handicap of involved’discussions.

Foremost among the measures
passed Wednesday evening was the

expected postponement of the ref-
erendum on the proposed Men’s Self
Governing Association. This action
was looked for inasmuch as Emanuel
Fishkin‘, Bus. Ad. ’31, chairman of
the committee preparingthis plan of
revised student government, and
Walter Rome, graduate manager of

activities, both had‘ indicated last

week that this was the only logical

- thing for the governing’ body to do.

At Wednesday’s meeting Fishkin
merely introduced a. resolution pro-
viding’ for the postponement, which
was received with little questioning
and accepted by a unanimous vote of
those present.

Lack of Time Reason

Lack of time for whipping the ten-
tative constitution into deﬁnite’ shape
before the general school elections.
next Friday, with, the principal rea-
son for the deferring of the plan.

-Need for further discussion with rep-
resentatives of the various men’s

activities was a second, resaon ad~ "

vanced for the postponement of the
referendum. Fishkin reported that
several meetings with these “repre-
sentatives were. being ' planned for
the remainder ofthe present school
term. 1 . 8

Figures, decimal points, fractions
and equations have. been running
riot recently in the registrar's office
where the annual statistical report
has been in process of compilation.
And now that all, this jumbled mass
of ﬁguring has -been« smoothed out,
some interesting statisticsin regard
to the present enrollment in the
University. have been- brought to

- light. 8

First, the University has grown
during the past year. The current
net enrollment is 13,675, an increase
of 950 or 7.4- per cent over that for
the school year of 1928-29. This
total does not include 803 students
enrolled in the graduate schools and
junior colleges. . V

Second, decreases of 9.5 percent

and 7.2 per cent were noticed in the --

freshman classes in the campus and
off-campus schools, respectively. ‘
Third, enrollment by various
schools ﬁnds the school‘ of engineer-
ing boasting the largest gain; a 15
per cent increase over .V., -last year.
Other large advances were made by

while a gain of. 22.7 percent was
made at J ohnstown and 15.6 percent

331"5"¢¢ 01C‘ fejection. Approval is given Council,- however, for acting-wise-.

ly in refraining’ from forcing on _Pitt men "a half~w'ay measure. .

f'Principal criticism is directed toward the ‘laxity with which Coun-

" jci,l."C"c0nsiCde,red the plan this year." It "was, conceived as early as .Js.nu-

- .the. Men's" Self-Governing. Body?

ary, butdicouncil "did nothing more than appoint  committee which in
 -‘metvto~ discuss proposed changes a“nd“submitted' a verbal report to

they  body. Matters have, progressed" little beyond. ‘the j~discus--
« :ion‘._sti?"Lge.' But at, a recent Council meeting—this' body‘, apparently

became p7a’nic-stricken over" the "nearness of the impending. elections, and
the rathep haphazard verbal" report of the chairman of the committee
was "accepted without reservation. It was this plan which was "to be
l'ub"jec’_ced.to the referendum on May 16. " , ‘A

" V Butreﬂection is always‘ better" than snap judg'ment.— Council mem-
bers went fho.me.C to. think». it. over; the: c mn1"ittee:iC’ga:ve’ niorsgifonsidecatlon

_ to the proposed" changes ;’ faculty advisers" suggested "that the referendum

be deferred"; all agreedﬁgiat the" plan was inadequate and {needed greatéi‘
study. Because of this.“ Counci1’s action in rescinding steps already taken
toward thejreferendum was/the proper thing "to do. ; 

 plan of Men’s Self-Governing Association affects too many in-
terests and is tooniuch’ of an innovation to. be treated» lightly. Should
student governmenﬁbe,segregated; that is, should there be separate: leg-

i_sla.tive"C groups for men and wom¢nUndercsuch a. plan is there any C

place for the present Student Council? Who should be represented-'~ on

The track team  representatives
just failed to win in the relay events
at Ohio State. Utterback won the
broad jump, however, and kept the
banner waving for Pitt in at least
event._ Two records were

Pitt, used to hold these records.

e Personally, I’m not in favor ‘of
the idea. Let the fellows forget
about football or basketball during
the summer. It might boomerang
and cause staleness and loss of in-

know. ‘ ‘

Milt Cohen informs me that the
Interfraternity tennis tournament
willbe held in about a week. -Two
singles and one doubles matches; will
be played. There will be -a fee of
ﬁfty cents each time the team plays.

team has scheduled the University

match worth seeing this year unless
theyfadd a few more. V_ Let’s hope
so. Pi’La;mbda Phi," Jewish frater-

that. includes‘ every young net star
of any "promise on the coast. .

At the head of thelist is young
"Bobby” Seller,‘ who holds wins; over

Van‘ Ryn, -Doeg and Billy" Johnston.

This youngster can hold his own with

. is

 

Dolf Muheiser is" a capable and
worthy understudy of Seller. Dolf

I‘ has also taken‘ the measure of many

ranking coast stars. His game is
exceptionally sound, and it will take
a good man to trim‘ him.

“Bob” Muench is_ the third of
their famous triumvirate. Bob is
themost brilliant but also the most
erratic. When he is “on,’.’ it hides
ill for his opponent.

 

 

The fourth man is unknown to
your-writer, but knowing the other
threeas I do, I can safely say that
this will be the best college tennis
match‘ in the country. Pitt has the
best team she has ever had, and
California can say the same. If you
want to see more stars in action-
than have ever represented two uni-
versities, come ,out June 4.-

 

'I!h'e Golden Panther has again
stalked from its lair to crush the
Presidents in a one-sided match,

erful array of racqueteers graced
the stadium courts. A more deci-
sive victory has never been admin-
istered to the Presidents.

CUB TRACKMEN
  MEET STATE

_ Two meets are on the card for
Coach Frank Sheafs. fresh track
team within the next four days, the
little Panthers treking to State Col-
lege with the varsity today at noon
for adual fracas with Nate. Cart-
mell’s freshman spikers A tomorrow,
and also competing in a dual affair
with Guy Halfertyfs plebes of Car-
negie Tech next Tuesday. -Thus they
will have taken part in three meets
W~1_th1_n SIX days, they having met
Kiski prep" school last Wednesday,
a‘ hard program for any aggrega-
tion of runners and field men.

Little is known about the strength
or versatility of Cartniell’s frosh
team, but it is certain to be equal
to_ those of other years when the
Lions have .always taken over the
Pitt first-year men. - I

Asto the Plebe team, from across
Panther Hollow, quite a deal is,
known or can be inferred. “ They.
have a dashman of some repute in
Sigmund, who has turned'in times
this ‘year of 10, 1-5 in the’ century
and 22 2-5 in the furlong. ‘ That is
something for »R.3illy, Miller and
Calvert of Pitt to-worry over. Coul-
te_r IS another plebe who can’ step
with plenty of class, the former
Peabody relay man having done his
quarter-mi1e.in 53 -seconds ﬂat. An-
other worry for Bill Miller.

Coulter In Jump

In the distances, the Plebes have
Burns, Grimes and Ramsey,’ a for-
mer‘ Washington hi h‘ school per-
for_mer._ Watkins, _C ise and Bern-
stein will have trouble’ from them.
Ericson of Pitt is a likely winner in
the pole vault, although Schmidt and

 

 

10-foot vaulters. Cornell V-Copper-,
Pitt recordholder, is a surébwinner
of the broad and high jumps, al-
though Coulter will presshim in’ the
high leapand Sigmund is no mean
performer in the. broad jump.

Tech is also almost uniformly‘
weak in the weight events, but
Stentz, Croissant and’.Shuri will*be
working for the Plaid against Luch,
Lewis and Becker of Pitt.‘  .

‘The. following’ men will make the’
trip ‘to State College todaywith the
varsity_tracksters and-will also face

.In the doubles, your writer and
Dave O’Laughlin lield the situation
in -hand so well that there was
never any doubt about the outcome
of the match. - ‘

It remained for Adler and Bloom
to give the Panthers her ‘shutout
victory, but only after a. stunning

tions imposedon the contestants are
few. -Not more than three men
from one school can enter any one
event. The individual contestants
are limited in that each man ‘can-
not enter more than three events.

feating more deserving teams with
a ood all-around squad.

All appointments for cabinet

members of every women's organi-
zation on campus were made this
year by the senior, court of W. S.
G. A., Katherine Maneval, presid-
ing. Following the same plan em-
ployed earlier in the year in se-
lecting nominees for the executive
boards, each activity submitted its
tentative list of cabinet. members.
Senior court, acting as a clearing
house for the nominating commit-
tees, checked each suggested name
for eligibility, in scholarship and
activities points, and notiﬁed by let-
ter those women who had been ap-
proved in the office of dean of wom-
en.

The system used this year has
eliminated any overlapping of
chairmanships of the several organ-
izations. Although no one Woman
is permitted to assume chairmanship
of more than one committee, she
may have her choice of the two on
which her name appears before fi-
nal appointment.

We experienced no trouble at all
getting our expedition past the vig-
ilant stagedoor keeper at" the Nix-
on that last night of the Cap and
Gown . show. “Special Investigators,”
we hissed with our‘ ﬁngers to our
lips and-then, as he stood at at-

we passed on, blowing him a fare-
well kiss. 9 .4

Onthe stage, all was hustle and
bustle. Out in front of the audi-
ence, the orchestra was tuningeiip
their instruments to the "correct
wavelength and an instant later
swung into, the opening bars of
“Manhattan Preferred.” Abruptly,
the curtain rose, the show began,
"and we commenced , our 'pcrambula-
tions. c ' " 0

The stage of the Nixon, we dis-

place, over. eighty, feet high‘ and
over twice as wide as the curtain
opening through which the audience
seesthe show. The scenery for the
Cap and Gown show, just like the
scenery for any show, was hung
fromthe roof of the stage on ropes.
which are controlled from the ﬂy
galleries. ., _ " ,

‘Jimmy McAfee,«'whenf_ he came
soaring‘ downward’ aboard the" pen-
dant in one of the most beautiful
and startling, scenes in the show,
entrusted the safety of his life and
limb to the able stage crew.

‘The ﬂy; galleries, from where all
[these ropes and stage tackle are
operated in the Nixon are located
high’ above and to one side of the
stage." They ‘are like balconies and
here. the men stand who tug on the
tow lines when the Cathedral ’-of
Learning vanishes into thin: air and
the P R. R. information booth
takes its place in this world of

good look at the top of “Manhattan
Preferred.” The snappy; dancing
choruses wheeled and cavorted far

climb up a “mysterious circular
staircase,.- we got our friends of the
cast and choruses still further be-
neath us. . . A ..

We reached the scenery grills,
eighty feet above the stage. From
this -dizzy spot, you -could‘ look
right down through. a maze of
ropes, scenery,» lights and curtains

The far-famed dressing rooms of
the Nixon were our next point of
attack. They were probably haunt-
ed by the ghostsof Sarah .Be"rn-

‘thought and would give us a thrill.
No such thing. The Cap and Gown

_ ‘We learned several interesting
facts. in these historic spots how-

that Eddie Bonner, "Col. ’32, manip-

place where the four wings resolve

* themselves into the central“ tower,

a much better understanding of_the
effectffand plan of » the; ’ combined
Modern and -Gothic ‘styles of archi-
tecture employed is being secured
by all who have seen the Cathedral
recently. , ‘  _ _

The Bigelow Boulevard Wing 1S
entirely completed, the Belleﬁeld
wing -is almost/ﬁnished_ atits para-

" pet, "and the" simultaneous: work

now progressing near the peaks of

C1 the Fifth‘ avenue’ and Forbes street

wings will bring, these to.comple-

- tion Within two weeks’ time.

_"Unite Gothic Modern A 1
. When thesefour wings are en-
tirely built, twenty-eight .tracery

.- windows will" have been set into the
’ structure.

These‘ stone windows
with their pointed arches are at the
head‘-of the long parallel lines of
soaring buttresses and window mul-
lions, thus uniting the traditional

. Gothic design with the modernity of

a high buildingand plane surfaces.
" There] is an, up-to jate freshness
about "the Gothic def igns used,.for
the Cathedral," howﬁaver. Though
Jconventionally Gothic in spirit, the

. stone possesses an almost_ Greek

simplicity _p.ncl1':grace. of" execution;
There, is ‘delicate stone cutting and
‘elaborate -.details,'but the masonry.
is -not tortured into all manner of

_weird and "florid "curlecues. of carv-

ing,‘and decorationas are so [many
_ so-called Gothic
style in Europe. , V 1 " .

experience a sense of ‘fitness and
proportion. Each curve, each tan-_
gent of the_ stone, helps to form a

skyor varied, Oakland. landscape. \
i From. -the Belleﬁeld windows, the-
new gleaming apartment housesfof
the ‘East Liberty’ and East Oakland
districts-11 can be seen below 'and'in
the distance. From the Fifth ave-
,nue side, the'University campus and
the entire hillside 1ies‘spread out as
though on a map, white buildings
against greenery... [ 1 ‘
_ The view from the Bigelow Bou-
levard1_"windows1 comprises a look-
out over Forbes Fieldito-the Mon-
ongahela and1-av’ panorama of the

-‘Oakland business district.-, , -'

sected land of 1Schenley Park, the
grimlgray "mass of Carnegi"e,Insti-

with green" isles that is the park
entrance, Ware laid. out below in the
frame of the windows. Fromjthat
height, the eye’ dominates a small

esting.’ And” the higher up the
tower you ‘go, the more world and
the more interesting "thethings to
view. There_ are no less than 2,400
windows in”. the Cathedral from
which to.see1the town. [ - " ;
-- Besides thesetting of stone, oth-
er" work in progress on the buildin
includes the completion of the fourth
elevator and the setting of ten car-

window‘ frames are at present - be-
ing‘pla_ced.in the basement butwork
etting them in upper ﬂoors will be-

gin soon. .

.jThe combined area ‘of all the
ﬂoors ‘in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing equals more than 11%, acres.'It
would take a building one story
high covering almost the whole_ of
the Frick; Acres" quadrangle to
equal the Cathedral’s floor space.
