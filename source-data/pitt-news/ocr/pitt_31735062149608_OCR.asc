‘I/VEDNESDAY, MARCH 29, 1939

An SFA President
Makes His Report

UBLISHED elsewhere in this paper is a report

by SFA president John Downie “presented to
the students of the University to acquaint them
with the activities of the Student-Faculty Associa-
tion during the school year, 19I’8-1939.

The report. outlining SFA activities from pep as-
semblies to parking calnpaigus. tends to bear out
that now-platitudinous political maxim that most
of the work of a governing body is done “behind
the scenes" or in committee. For the Dowuie re-
port is merely an itemizing of the activities of the
various SFA committees, most of which are headed

' by students who are not SFA members.

All on the credit side of the ledger, the presi-
dent 's statement presents an imposing list of accom-
plishments, shot through with superﬁcialities and
routine tasks which any student governing body
worthy of the name would have to perform. Elim-

ating these activities we may ﬁnd several accom-

slnncnts of the Sl<‘A committees which have real-
nade a contribution to student life at Pitt:

(1) l\Iuch-needed improvements in the Tuck
Shop and other recreational facilities have result-
cd partially through the work of the Building
and Grounds conimittce: promise of more im-
provements has been made.

(2) For the ﬁrst time in many years, a com-
plete stndent directory was published. and plans
are being made to continue its publication.

(3) A progrrar‘. of regular weekly movies. free
to the stutlents, has helped enlarge the Univer-

‘sity’s recreational prograni. '

'l‘l1ese and other, more routine projects. like
Scholars’ Day, lligli School relations. concert hours,
safety cam iaigns. and Spriiig festival. have all been
worthwhile a.ctivities. Most of them however. were
directed by committee chairmen who were not
members of SFA. and whose activities were merely
coordinated b_v the parent body.

Cow let us e\'amiue more closely the accomplish-

nts of the Sl": ass-'eml)l_v itself. It appointed a

ac-ial committee last November 15 to investigate’

tters of (1) Freshman football players, (2) Uni-
.-"sitv building program, and (3) l’ublicatious.
The result was a publication of the official l'ni-
vcrsity reply on the problems concerned with no
comments or rcconnneudatious whatsoever by the
committee. which seemed content to gloss over
those pre.<;sin,<2' matters. '

A couple of months later the assembly not-so-
uca lily side-stepped a vote on the ret'ugee proposal,
refusintr to risk a stand on either side of the (ques-
tion. By the convenient’ plea of “no quorum” the
question was left siispeutletl.

The assembly passively acquiesced to a new nub-
lications policy lunuletl down from above ‘.‘.'ll'll0lli
the approval or even the consultation of any mem-
bers; of the ‘D1‘.lIll:['t‘.ll(¥ll.< staffs. and thereafter care-
fully avoi<le(l any reopening: of the situation.

lluring the recent student mitbreaks and llSZ‘l_\'

For three yeaxs we have been trying to answer the
question “What is the proper time to get up for an 8:30
class?” On all the days that we have 9:30 -classes, the
_orc-blem appears trivial, but then come those eerie Tues-
day mornings when it seems we have to get up in the
middle of the night.

On those days, we realize, with a touch of fatalism,
there is no infallible standard to guide us. We have to
lie in bed still thinking about the proper time to get up.

And the question is an earnest one to any college stu-
dent.
starts, you are swamped with regrets that you could
have spent those three minutes so wisely——still in bed—
if only they had existed an hour or half—hour earlier.

As far as we can see, how early, or how late, you
have to get up depends on two facts:

1. Whether or not you choose your clothes the night
before.

2. How fast you can eat breakfast.

Choosing your clothes the night before sometimes re-
sults in horrible combinations. Sometimes you have to
admit, “That may be how I felt last night, but what .11
different person I am this morning!” On the other hand,
it is difficult for some people to choose any clothes at
all in the morning. since waking up depresses them so.

cient routine. Orange juice. coffee, where’s my hat,

three out of four games during the,

offs. the Panthers came back the
liarcl way, battling the Dukes to :1

the second clash, tieing up the ser-
ies with a 3-1 win Saturday, and
ﬁnally capturing the eastern division
title with a heart stopping 2-1 tri-

By virtue of their two victories
and L1 tie in the four game playoifs,
the Panthers earned the right to

ter Fred Rancourt and left wing Ed-
die Arsenault. The dark haired Ar-
seiiault. an all state football half-
back, established a new Ohio-Penn
league scoring record this year with
41 goals and 14 assists for 55 points
in 18 games.

Rana-curt Good

The bespectacled Rancourt, al-
though not so sensational as his
skating mate, is superior defensive-
ly, a more skillful skater, and only
a shade behind in the scoring column
as his 27 goals and 23 assists at-
test. Rancourt sets up most of the
Cairoll scoring plays with his deadly
passing.

J iin Meyers, the other member of
the Arsenault-Rancourt line, has
been overshadowed by his high gear-
ed companions, but still managed
to whip 14 goals into the cords and

pla 's.

The Clevelanders ﬁnished the sea-
son with 14 wins, a tie, and a trio of
losses, two administered by Du-
quesne, the other by Western Re-
serve. I_n_ all fairness, it must be ad-
mitted that the Reserve triumph and
one of the Duquesne conquests came
during the Christmas holidays when
Rancourt and Arsenault were at
their home in Maine.

Pitt ‘Well-Tested

There is an extremely positive
contrast between the playoff rec-
ords of the two outﬁts this year.
While Pitt was battling the Dukes,
Carroll was swamping Fenn, 12-0,

and cleaning up on Western Reserve j

twice, 5-1 and 7-2. The lack of op-
position may work to Carrol1’s dis-
advantage, any team playing better
when it has been tested under heavy
ﬁre.

According to the latter statement,
the Panthers should rate good be-ts
to walk away with the titular clashes,
for if any team ever was tested un-
der ﬁre, it was Pitt on Monday night.

Throughout the fracas the Dukes
did most of the threatening but Pan-
ther goalie Bud Ellis, playing deg-
perately, rose to heights of efficiency

he never even approached during the

Oregular season, and turned aside shot.

after shot to ﬁnish the game with 35
saves to Iungericli’s 18. But even
Bud’s brilliance would have been
inadequate had it not been for the
close checking of Iron Man Walter
Lovett at defense.

tied it up early in the ﬁnal frame.
Just 31 seconds later, the light ﬂash-
ed behind the Dukes’ -cage, and Pitt
was out in front to stay.

Friday Scores

Bob Schooley, his bruised leg ap-
_parently just about healed, skidded
in the opening tally, and Dick Friday,
‘for the second consecutive match,
put in the clincher. Ozzie Artz, pet
hate of the Bluff fans, drew assists
on both plays. Bill Vance, still tired,
broke away, on a solo for the Du-
qtiesiie point.

Although the Dukes did the at-
tacking, it was a Panther who bat-
ted in the only goal of the ﬁrst 15
minute spree. Playing four or five
men down the ice, Duquesne kept the
puck in the Pitt defense almost con-
tinually, except for brief spurts on
the part of Panthers who intercept-
ed Duke passes.

The lone tally came after a faceoff
near the Pitt net, Artz pushing a
pass to Schooley at the Duke blue
line from which point Bob skated in
from the left and beat Iungericli
cleanly froin 20 feet out at 11:58.
Ellis Saves

Although play“-in~ the first two
minutes of the next period was at
the Duquesne end of the ice, it wasn’t
long until the action had shifted back
to the Pitt cage where Ellis was forc-
ed to clear 12 shots during the ses-
sion. So busy did the Dukes keep
Bud that Pitt had only one real
scoring chance in the period, Shir-
iing shooting wildly past an open
;cage at 11:00.

_ Both clubs connected 1!‘): the ﬁnal
tround but Ellis was worked overtime
iby the fran-tic Dukes. After’ saving
;beautifully on three or four sizzlers,
;Elis fell victim to Vance at. 3:16., the
§Duike star skaiting the length of the
{ice and ﬁring from 10 feet out after
.eluding the defense.

stars will assist new head football
coach Charles “Chisel” Bowser,
when the belated spring drills are
begun, either today or tomorrow.

The coaching board will func-
tion —without a ﬁrst-assistant next
season. All six tutors will have the
same status and be directly respon-
sible to the head mentor.

Mike Nicksick, backﬁeld coach, is
the only member of last year’s board
of strategy retained in the new set-
up. The ﬁve new men are Nick
Kliskey, who will handlevthe centers
and act as personnel assistant; Bob
Hoel, tackles; Arnold Greene, full-
backs and quarterbacks; Bill Daddio,
ends, and Albin Lezouski, guards.

Daddio and Lezouski, mentioned
on numerous All-Ainerican selections
the past season, are to be student-
coaches, at least
during spring
practice, since
they will not re-
ceive their de-
grees until June.
Both boys have
been V a r s i t y
players for three
years. Daddio ~ is
also an outstand-
ing district golf-
er, and will prob-
ably be Pitt’s
number one link-
man.

Nicksick was a
second—string half-
back in ’32 and ’33 and developed in-

Dr. Greene

A six—nian staff of EX-P3nll1B1‘A>'

to a near All-American ball carrieer
in ’34, his senior campaign. This
will mark his third year as a back—1
ﬁeld coach at the University. Heady
and well—schooled in Pitt football,
Nick may later be boosted into the
now-vacant post of assistant coach.
The naming of Kliskey, captain of
the 1935 gridders, was a comparative
surprise since he had come up for
mention only recently. One of a long

should be able to impart his knowl-
edge of the pivot man’s duties with
more than average success.

A fellow member of Nicksick’s on
the near-national champions of 1934
was Bobby I-loel, new tackle coach.
Beefy Bob will have one of the most
diﬁcicult jobs of the new mentors,

since Panther plays depend on ex- -

cellent tackles, a questionable quan-
tity at Pitt this year.

Arnold “Doc” Greene is another
unexpected arrival on the Cathedral
coaching secene. Greene was a sc—so

Leading Nines
Triumph Again

0 O
B B10‘ Maraiiis
Y to — 25

Five fraternity mushball nines came
through to win their second consecu-
tive games Saturday, and one club
batted out its initial win.

Delta Tau Delta and Sigma Alpha
Mu were awarded gift victories over
Kappa Sigma and Lambda Chi Alpha
when the latter two teams failed to
put in an appearance.

In the games played, Phi Delta
Theta used Phi Kappa as a door mat
and trounced the latter, 22-8. The
Craig Street team led by four runs up
to the third inning. The Phi Delts
went on a rampage in this inning and
when the last out was ﬁnally made,
16 runs had crossed the plate.

Bernie Cashdollar again was the
ﬂipper for the winners with Jack
Glenn being charged with the defeat.
“Congo’ Fullerton cleared the fence
with a line drive in the big inning
with the bases loaded to capacity.

Pi Kappa Alpha won a see-saw
contest from Phi Gamma Delta, 8-5.
The Fijis scored one run in each of
the ﬁrst two innings, but the PiKA’s
deadlocked in the second. The third
inning produced three runs for pitch-
er Light and company and two for
the Fijis. In the ﬁfth the PiKA’s put
the game on ice with two more runs,
the result of Ow’s homer.

Sigma Alplia Epsilon opened its
season with a 16-10 victory over
Theta Chi. Tlie victors scored four
runs in the ﬁrst and eight runs in
the second to sew up the game early.
McElfresh, Lariincr. and Pullovy had
three hits each for the winners, and
Potter had a like number for Theta
Chi.

Pi Lambda Phi shut out Sigma Chi,
3-0, to win its second game of the
season, Kristl’s double in the sixth
inning was the only hit secured by
the Sigma C‘.hi‘s. “Weese” Weisber-
ger, Pi Lam catcher, stopped a foul
tip with his eye for the only casualty
of the game. Grant was the losing
pitcher, and Jafle was credited with
his second win.
