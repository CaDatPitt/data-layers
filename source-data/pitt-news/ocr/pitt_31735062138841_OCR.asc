UNIVERSITY TAKES PART IN  
GREAT MINING EXPERIMENT

Mining Students at University
Attend the Greatest First
Aid Demonstration
Ever Held

This week the students in the
School of Mines in the University
have been attending t'he greatest ﬁrst
aid demonstration ever held in any
country. Last Monday there were as-
sembled at Bruceton and at the Ar-
senal grounds. the world’s greatest
mining experts in the largest number
ever gathered together at one time for
which will be epoch-
making in: all civilized countries. A

The tests at these places and the
first-aid demonstrations were attended
by all the students in the mining de-
partment. Several members of the
university faculty assisted in the ex-
periments. The mining department
professors expressed great satisfac-
tion over the success of the demon-
stration, saying that it had given the
students an opportunity never oﬁered
to the students of any other school.

The ﬁrst-aid demonstration was fea-
tured by a contest in which overforty
of the ﬁnest rescue and ﬁrst-aid teams
in the country took part. The teams
participating in this_ contest were the
prize winners—those who had already
won the highest prizes as being the
most skillful miners in this work to
be found in _the regions from which
they come.

Many notable . personages were
present at the Tuesday session of the
demonstration. Not only was Presi-
dent Taft an interested spectator, but
the secretary of the interior and the
director of the national bureau of
mines, representatives of several for-
eign nations and the ofﬁcials of every
important coal company in the world.

 

Chancellor Will .

Represent University

Dr. MCC-ormick, Chancellor of the
university» will represent the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh at the insallation of
the new president of West Virginia
th-e.1.atte-r part of this week. The lead-
ing‘-men from many institution's of
learning will be present and the stu-
dents of the West Virginia institution

.expect a great celebration.

President’ Met by University Men
on His Arrival in
Pittsburgh.

 

Fifteen hundred loyal Pitt students‘
stood in a heavy rain for forty-ﬁve
minutes yesterday morning, in order
to pay respect to President Taft, as
he passed on his way to“ Forbes Field.

As early as 8:15 a large number of
students had gathered in and about
State and Thaw Halls,.and the num-
ber grew rapidly untilat 8:25, when
the student band called «all the stu-
dents together at Bayard street and
Grant boulevard, nearly three-fourths
of the. entire student. body was
present.

At 8:30_ the band struck up “Hail
to Pitt!” and the students formed in
line and marched to Fifth avenue,
and then up Fift'h a short distance and
took their places along the curb on
b'oth sides of the street.

A cold rain was falling steadily
during the formation of the parade
and during nearly the whole time un-
til the arrival of the President, but
not a person left the line. Some ﬁfty-

On last Thursday afternoon one of
the most successful demonstrations of

Dentists Await
_ New Building

 

Dentistry Building Now in the Course
of Construction Will Be Well
Equipped.

 

The great event of the year with the
University of Pittsburgh will be the
completion and formal "opening of the
new dental college, which is the latest
acquisition to the long chain of hand-
some structures which make up the
university. . -

The -building is constructed of brick,
three stories in height, with sandstone
trimmings and Greek architecture pre-
vailing; situated on the university
campus and commanding an eminent
and inspiring view of picturesque
Oakl.and on the one hand, and the ar-
tistic model site of' proposed chain of
26 buildings on the other.

When this dental building is ﬁnally
completed it will add laurels to the
university as a whole, and no pains
will be spared, either ﬁnancially or
otherwise, in making this one ofthe
best equipped departments of its kind
on the American continent. All the
modern ideas will predominate: muse-
um, library, reading room, separate
laboratories for each class. The in-
Ermary will be fully equipped with
gas, electricity and running water at
each chair. There will be the same
equipment in the laboratories. In
fact, everything that tends for the
comfort and convenience of the stu-
dents will be incomplete.

The dental students from all parts
of the United States who are enrolled
with this institution at present look
forward with great anticipation and
delight at the prospect of enjoying
the many privileges of a new home in
the near future, when greater effort
will be made by the efficient faculty
in broadening the scope of advanced

students in scientiﬁc dentistry.

BUILDING FUND

Raising Funds for Student
Building Passed by
‘ Convocation

 

Last Wednesday, October 25, the
University had a mass meeting of all
the Departments in the chapel of the
adjoining the campus. 4 .

Well spiced with humor the discus-
si'ons A
who were present. The regular ex-
erciseswere omitted and the hour
was occupied by three
speeches by the ‘Deans and others.
These were devoted to consideration
of ways and means by which the stu-
dents could secure funds for a new
student building. ,

Dean Fetterman led off _with a
short speech in which he emphasized
the fact that in converting this bar-
ren hill into the center of learning
for which the University stands, the
students must give their organized
support or the plan is a failure. I

TO RAISE BUILDING FUND

‘(Continued from Page 1)
Dr. Bishop said that the engineers

‘were always in the front and would

be there also when the time came for
action. A

This brought down t'he wrath of
our young bankers, and one
deavored ‘to defend his department.
but was ruled out.

Mr. Goodale was ﬁrm in his belief
that we must unite to have any en-
thusiasm, for, like courtship, it can’-L
be carried on by telephone. We must
get together before we can accom-
plish anything.

Dr. Walter Riddle, ’02, was
next speaker. He is a forceful, point-
ed and humorous speaker. He told
us that the alumni council had ap-
pointed a committee last Monday
night to help us in raising the fund.
He /reviewed the history of the school
when it was W. U. P., to the interest
of.those present. '

The Chancellor next singled Coach
Thompson out from the audience.
Coach Thompson said regarding the
new building: “Theistudents can do
more toward raising the money than
anyone else in the University. They
speak from the heart. T'hey can go
among their friends and if each one
raises a hundred dollars we can build
two -buildings like that. He blamed
the defeat of last Saturday against
Carlisle on the superior ability of the
Indians. “Theyr are the greatest
team I ever saw,” he said. He con-
gratulated the rooters for their spirit
in the face of defeat, saying: “It
was the best ever shown in Pittsburg
University.”

As the outcome of the meeting the
students adopted the resolution to
organize and to work for this build-
ing as whole departments.

 

Pitt Professor Writes Book.

 

Dr. Stewart L. McCurdy has re-
cently completed a new text book on
Oral Surgery, which has now been

‘ approved by the Commission on Den-

tal Pedagogics of America, and will
be of. great assistance and interest to
the profession. Dr. McCurdy is a well-
known authority, and the author of
several other books and abstracts on
different subjects of great interest to
students.

 

Part Holiday on Tuesday.

 

Owing to the attendance of many
of the students of the university at
the exercises of the mining demon-
stration and those of the rivers nav-
igation centenary celebration, no
classes were held yesterday after-
noon.

ENGINEERING NEWS.

. Mr. Weber, a member of the fac-
ulty in the School of Engineering,
recently returned from an inspection
trip in the east. During this time he
visited Cornell, Wooster, Rensselar
Polytechnic and the University of
Pennsylvania, in an effort to secure
ideas on building construction to be
used in planning the new engineering
building. It is the ambition of those
in charge to have this building erected
as soon as possible inorder to relieve
the crowded condition which exists at
present.’

Dr. Bishop and Mr. Weber made a

' visit to Purdue last week to inspect

the buildingsat that place. They se-
cured many 'modern ideas which they
expect to make use of in construct-
ing the engineering buildings at Pitt.

Mr. Morris Knowles, director, of
sanitary engineering, has been re-
tained by the coal operators Of Ala-
bama to investigate and make a re-
port on the sanitary conditions exist-
ing in the-various mining colonies of
that state. A ,

Through the efforts of Mr. Lincoln
the University has recently been pre-
sented with one of the electric gover-
nors in use at the Niagara Falls
power plant. The governors are being
replaced by new ones. This particu-
lar one given to the University was
Lincoln sixteen
years’ ago‘. Such a gift will be of
great value to the electrical depart-
ment. . ‘ .

Dr. Bishop will attend the conven-
tion of the National.Society for the
Promotion of Industrial Education
heldlat Cincinnati next week. At this
convention a society will be ‘formed

' representing’ colleges and universities

doing co-operative work. Other im-
portant matters will also be discussed.

" Dr. Snyder, Dean of the University

of Cincinnati, and Dr. Bishop’ will
represent the colleges and universi-
tiesiusing the co—operative system.

Prof. Stuart was called to Toledo
last week on some consulting engi-
neering work.

‘ANOTHER SCANDAL

‘ AT NAVAL ACADEMY

 

A Second Year Man Hazes _Two
Fourth Year Men in Presence
of Two Girls Who Are
His Guests.

Great indignation was aroused at
Annapolislast week when it was dis-
covered that one of t'he,second year
men for the amusement of two society
girls of that city had hazed two fourth
year men believed to be W. D. Alex-
ander, son of Major Alexander, of the
armygand D.  Watson. A rigid in-
vestigation is being made in the hope
that the guilty man may ‘be’ discov-
ered. ' .

Nothing since the fatal Merri-
wether-Branch class ﬁght has created
such a stir at the naval academy. The
authorities have received word of the
occurrence and will make_an ofﬁcial
investigation.

The second classman for the amuse-
ment of his ‘two fair guests took them
to the rooms of the two fourth class-
men and there put them through a
course of sprouts." One of the exer-
cises commanded was the famous “No.
16” on the setting up exercises. Then
the cadets were forced to stand on
their head's and hands and when ready
to collapse from exhaustion the sec-
ond classman and his two visitors left
them. ' S

THE NEW BUILDING.

At the last general meetingof the
students, a resolution was passed
directing the Student Senate t'o take
steps immediately toward raising the
funds needed to secure the student
building. In the past the'Student
Senate has been hzmdicapped by the
many needs to which its attention
has been called. Perhaps through
dismay at the unusual responsibilities
thrust upon them, the student repre-
sentatives have not been successful in
reaching the standard of efficiency set
by their constituents.

Yet though there has been much
dissatisfaction with the work of the
Senate, there can be no doubt that
this body has been constantly gain-
ing strength. The manner in which
the inter-class contests were managed
speaks well for the ability of the Sen-
ators. So there will be general satis-
faction with the action of the student
body in placing so important a re-
sponsibility upon the Senate.

We trust that the student repre-
sentatives will place their plans be-
fore the students as soon as possible.
If the students are to raise so large a
sum as will be necessary for the con-
struction of a student’s "social build-
ing, it will be necessary for them to
enter upon this work ‘within a very
To be successful, every
-man attending the University must be
enrolled byithe Senate and, assigned
a ‘certain part of this task for which
he shall be responsible. Only through
long persistent efifhrt by the students
acting as one body under the leader-
ship of the Senate can such an under-
taking be carried through to a1 suc-
cessful termination. ‘

CONGRATULATIONS.

Never in the history of the Uni-
versity has there been held so suc-
cessful a rooters’ meeting as was held
last Thursday. The orderly, well-
planned parade which preceded the
meeting could not fail to impress
favorably the spectators. The en-
thusiasm displayed by the boys at
the station was unsurpassed. Men’
who have been in close touch with
the University for a score or more
of years say they have never seen so
much enthusiasm displayed over any
brand of intercollegiate activity.

We congratulate the students on
the wonderful loyalty with which they
are supporting the team. The boys‘
have been unfortunate so far, but they
are certainly deserving of the heart-
iest support of the student body. It
is the spirit which cheers on the boys

when the team» is losing which we so .

heartily admire. The little band of
rooters which took the long trip to
Cornell are especially worthy of
praise. Although at the very start of
the game, through an unlucky break,
our opponents were able to score, at
no time did rooters or team relax

their efforts. They. were rbothfound ,

pulling harder for Pitt at the end of
the game than at the beginning.

We wish to congratulate the men
representing Pitt on the ﬁeld last
Saturday for their clean work in‘ spite
of great provocation. Their deter-
mination to play the game in a sports-
manlike manner, no matter what
their opponents would do, was se-
verely tested. Greajr. provocation was
given them and they stood the test.
Better by far is it to l'ose honorably
than to descend toifoul tactics to win.
The team is a credit to the Univer-
sity’. 0 They deserve all the support
the students can give them. Let
every man rally round the school and
show the men that we are back of
them, that we are proud of them.

AN EDUCATIONAL CENTER.

The great mining demonstration
conducted by the National Bureau of
Mines this week again calls atten-
tion to the importance of Pittsburgh
as an educational center. In ho other
city in the country perhaps are such
opportunities open to the student de-
siring both practical and theoretical
knowledge along industrial lines.
Seldom does a week pass without
some great educational exhibition.

In the present case the students of
our School of Mines will have the
opportunity to be present at practi-
cally every feature of an exhibition
which in the opinion of experts will
make an important chapter in the his-
tory of the mining industry. Every
facility has been -given them to under-
stand thoroughly the tests under-
taken at the exhibition. So _unpar-
alleled an opportunity is eagerly wel-
comed by the mining students at the
University of Pittsburgh.

Another building is being planned
for the Engineering Department.
More room is needed for'the shops
and laboratories.

Some high ideals concerning the
standard of Eastern. football teams
were badly shattered last Saturday.
We trust the Pitt team will not imi-
tate such pernicious examples.

 

The send-off for the team last
Thiirsday shows what Pitt students
can do. Keep the good work going.

;

The students are evidently deter-
mined, to get that students’ club
house, so there remains no doubt as
to the outcome of this campaign. If
they want it they will get it.

Chapel is becoming popular n-ow.
The attendance has improved over
one hundred per cent. So has chapel!

Our mining professors are quite busy
this week helping the national gov-
ernmenthold its exhibits.

A good Alm.a Mater is needed now.
All the poets of the University are
each requested to write one.

 

The boys put up a goodgameilast

Editor Pitt Weekly:

Dear Sir:—As the work of the fall
term has progressed, so we are being
enthused over the wonderful plan-s
-which, when carried out, will make
this the most eventful year in the
history of the University. \

From time to time the students
have ‘been impressed with the
that their organization must play a
very important _part. Among these

organizations, as most of youknow, ‘

is the dramatic club, known as the
“Cap and Gown Club,” and which is
to take a’ most important part in mak-
ing our anniversary celebration what
it should be. _ ’

The play is well under way, and
what we need now is the ‘regular at-

tending of rehearsals and meetings by

the old members as well as new ones.

"It is especially urged that many new

men come out and try for a place in
the play. If you want to do some-
thing for your school “do it now,”
and be sure to be out at the next

meeting, -Thursday, ‘November 2, of_

this week, at 8 o’clock sharp, in Chapel
room of Thaw Hall. An election of
ofﬁcers for the ensuing year will take
place. Sincerely yours, A

Editor Pitt VVeeklyi:

Dear Sir:—_-—While visiting another
college recently I noticed that after
every football game the students of

that institution sung their alma mater

before leaving the stands. This is a
custom which'I believe should be in-
stituted_at Pitt. Nothing sounds bet-
ter than such a song after -the game,
whether we win or lose. In case this
suggestion meets with favor from the
student body, I hope that action will
be taken toward adopting such a sug-
gestion. The adoption of this custom
would be a very ﬁne way in which to
make a favorable impression after the
football games. '

Yours for Pitt,
A. ROOTER.

 

Students’ Building.

As the "students last Wednesday
voted to raise the money for a stu-
dent social building, I wish to urge
that steps be taken immediately to
start the campaign for the funds
needed to construct this building. If
we are toisecure one hundred thou-
sand dollars by next Febi'uary, it will

be necessary for us to start immedi-

ately. For one, I hope and thinkathat
we will be successful in this task, but
I believe that it will be a job which
will require the utmost endeavors of
every student. A A

I trust that the Student Senate will
act immediately upon the resolution
passed at the meeting Wednesday.
The success of the movement depends
to a large extent upon the action, of
the senate. A great responsibility
rests upon it. In the past this body

While everyone’ was patiently await-

After ‘he had gone, all the Pitt stu-

In an exciting game of football at

four minutes of play in the ﬁrst quar-

Tter, when a kick took a bad bound

away from “Tilli'e" Dewar and was

end, who carried it over for a touch-
down and then kicked goal. The same
kind of play gave the "Indians l2

Players and Alumni
Enjoy Trip to Ithaca

The football team as well as their

alumni following were loud in their

praise of the way the trip to Ithaca
was arranged and carried out. Every
detail was perfect and Graduate Man-
ager Hurst deserves much credit for
his splendid work. C. W. Cook, City
Passenger Agent of the P. & L. E. R.
R., accompanied the te.am_-and his as-
sistance was greatly appreciated by
Manager Hurst. ‘

The players who made the trip were

-Capt. Lindsay, Stevenson, Smith,’ Gal-

vin, Blair, Leahy, Graves, Soles, De-
war, Brown, Feightner,‘ Wagner,
Quailey, Gehlert, Cummins,l Gehlert,
Connelly, Kernohan and Dillon.
Others who made the trip were A. R.»
Hamilton, Dr. McPar1and, Dr. Judd,
Dr. Wymard, Karl Davis, Hazlett,
Cheer Leader Kirk,'Paul Hamilton,
Alex Stevenson, Manager Hurst,
Chalmers Hall, Coach Joe Th‘ompson
and Trainer Jack Adams.

A number of students attended the
game-and upheld the honor of Old
Pitt in cheering. These men are Rus-
sell Stambaugh, Ralph George, Ab
Frost, Dick Johnson, Bannister, Ralph
Smith, Olie Camp, Follansbee, Col-
lins, King Leitc'h, Bill Conrad, Lauro
and several others. These men de-
serve special credit for their spirit in
rooting during the game and being
“good sports” in time of defeat.

A special Pullman car conveyed the
party to Buffalo where they arrived
at 10 P. M. After a pleasant night
at Hotel Statler, the party took a
train on the Lehigh Valley at 9 A,
M. for Ithaca and arrived there at
12:06. After an hour’s journey on an
electric road the party reached the
Rogues’ Harbor Country Club, which
is about 8 miles out of It'haca. A
fast practice was held in the after-
noon in a driving storm of sleet.

Saturday dawned clear and cold and
after taking a short walk after break-
fast most o.f the football squad spent
the’ morning in resting up for the
game. The day was ideal for foot-
ball.

The party left Ithaca at 6:12 and
arrived in Pittsburgh at 8 A. M. Sun-
day.

Indiana Team Has Made Good
Record This Year—Defeated
Pitt in Last Engagement 6-0
—Great Game Expected

From the large scores that Notre.
Dame ‘has rolled up on her opponents

this season, it is very evident that she
has a strong, fast eleven, and will give
Pitt .21 hard battle here next Saturday.
-In 1909 this college
western championship
Pitt in an exiciting game 6-0.

Notre Dame has had very easy
games to date and Psitt’s two hard
games should give her an advantage
even though they were both chalked
up on the wrong side of the scoring
column._ The team is not discouraged
by the last two defeats as luck played
a prominent part for the opponents,
and hopes to break the losing streak
by walloping the Indiana aggregation.

Several of the Pitt standbys faced
Notre D.ame in 1909: Lindsay, Steven-
son, Blair and Galvin are the players,
and their former experience is ex-
pected tor-be of great assistance to
them. ,

Notre -Dame has a large following
in Pittsburgh and will be well repre-
sented at the game, [two sections hav-

ing been reserved for their rooters.

The general admission tickets .a-re
twenty-ﬁve cents and reserved seats
are on sale for seventy-ﬁve cents at
Spauldings, VVood street, the Atwood
Pharmacy in Oakland, and Emil Rup-
pel’s in East Liberty. 1 ’

GOLD AND BLUE ELEVEN
DEFEATED BY CORNELL

 

(Continued from Page 6)
entire game and the vile language
hurled at the Pittsburgh men by the

Cornell linemen was often audible on

the sidelines. Five Cornell players
were removed from the ﬁeld in the
two games preceding the Pitt game
for slugging, which goes to substan-
tiate the fact that the entire team in-
dulges in unfair and", ungentlemanly
work. The day before the Pittsburgh
team left for Ithaca, Chancellor Mc-
Cormick urged the men to uphold t'he
honor of ‘the university by playing a
clean, hard game of. football, and the
fact that the men did this under_ such
trying circumstances shows that the
university, and not victory, holds ﬁrst
place in their minds. The ‘officials
made some glaring ‘decisions in the
game, but it is best to leave these
disagreeable features out of the ac-
count. Just as the third quarter came
to a cl'ose, Vanderhill, the Cornell full
back, was ordered from the game for
slugging Quarterback Dewar, who is

' about ﬁfty pounds lighter in‘weight

than the. husky Ithacan. His, team-
mates have a way of covering up such
infractions "by carrying the offending
player from the ﬁeld and in this way
giving the impression that he is in-
jured. his ruse worked with the
spectators til it was seen that Cor-
-nell was pena 'zed half way to their
goal line. ,

Several times Capt. Lindsay and
Coach Thompson raised strenuous
kicks about some of Pendleton's or
De Camp’s rulings and it looked as
though the G'old and Blue suffered
several times from such decisions.
After the game Coach Thompson
said: “I can now see why W. & J.
kicked about the officials after their
game here. The work of several of
the men who had to-day’s' game in
charge w.as anything but satisfactory.”
McCarty, of Germantown, who um-
pired,adid his usual good work, how-
ever. _ .

After the‘ ﬁrst quarter, when Pitt
was outplayed by Cornell, they easily
held Ithacans even and at several
stages of the game outplayed their
opponents. Even, after Cornell had
scored 6 points at the start of the
game, the Pitt adherents felt conﬁdent
of victory, and when Galvin negoti-
ated a ﬁeld goal, this hope became a
conviction. Eyler’s ﬁeld goal, which
made the score 9-3, did not discour-
age the Pitt delegation, and in a few
minutes Pitt carried the ball to Cor-
nell’s 6-yard line. Galvin punted and
Quailey recovered the ball on the 25-

  
 
    
 

‘ yard ‘line. Brown, Feightner, Dewar

and Quailey then advanced the ball

I to the 6-yard line by the hardest kind

of work. Cornell held for two downs
and Pitt tried a fake placement but
McCormick grabbed “Ti11ie’s” for-
ward pass and O’Connor kicked the
ball out of danger. ’ , it

ond chance to score, but again failed.

PITT GIVES TEAM SEND-OFF

for almost two squares with six men

abreast.

Attracted by the music, thousands
lined both sides ef the street; the win-
dows -of stores were full of people,
watching the men of Pitt marching
along singing and. giving their college
yells. _

Cheer-leader Kirk put aside any
fear of being run over byia car or
wagon and got out in the middle of
the street and led the cheering. He
divided the line about equally and
then the divided yell of Pitt was
given. ,“Pi”‘ came from the forward
squad, “tt” came back the yell from
a block and a 'half back, and thus all
through the yell.

‘The line of march was d'own Lib-
erty t'o Market, to Fifth, to Smith-
ﬁeld, out Smithﬁeld and over the
bridge to the P. & L. E. A

All along Fifth Avenue was the
mob of people listening to the re-
turns of the last New York-Philadel-
phia game; but they forgot there. ever
was a world series when Pitt, two
thousand strong, came up the street.
The fellows with the megaphones an-
nouncing the plays as they came in
from ‘Philadelphia might just as well
have put up his megaphone and saved
his wind, for what were one or two
voices saying “strike one,” “ball one,”
against two thousand voices giving a
big divided yell or locomotive yell.
Every person paid undivided attention
to the Pitt parade and baseball was
dead as long as the parade lasted.
People stuck their heads out of sky-
scrapers, and risked life and 'limb=to
see what had got loose on Fifth
Avenue.

On up the street went the spirit of
Pitt, sweeping everything before it
and causing everyone to stop and ad-
mire such a mighty demonstration of
spirit. Out Smithﬁeld, yelling and
singing, across the bridge and up to
the station where a great cheering
feast was had. Such cheering must
have sent a thrill through,_eVeryone
that heard it, but it meant a great deal
more to the football warriors for
whom it was given.‘

Many of those who were in the
parade went with the team. to Ithaca,
those who were left at home gave a
ﬁnal cheer and quietly broke ‘up, and
one of the greatest exhibiti'ons 0f.c0l—
lege spirit the city of Pittsburgh has
ever seen was ended.

brought down by Eyrich. Had Dewar
or Wagner recovered this blocked
kick, it would have been impossible
for Cornell to avert a score,,but

such an extent that Eyrich was able

to nail him from behind.

ing practice at Ithaca last Saturday.
“Doc” Wymard was at quarter, A. R.
Hamilton and Dr. MacParland held
down the halves, and Dr. Judd was at
full back. While the scrimmage was
not very hard, these players repre-
sented. Cornell nobly.

"One of the funniest incidents of the
trip happened at Hotel Statler in
Buffalo" Thursday night. Charles
Quailey, who is always up to some
kind of trick, went to the second ﬂoor
of the hotel and called up “Auggie”
Blair over the ’phone. Several pages
were sent in search of Blair. “Auggie”
heard his name called from one end
of the corridor and ran there at top
speed, only to ﬁnd that he could not
locate the voice. “Mr. Blair!” was
then heard at the other end of the
corrid'or and again “Auggie” sprintedf
The bunch “got wise” and Blair was
“paged” many times before he was
safe again on Pittsburgh soil.

The ’Varsity ran through fast sig-
nal practice in a driving storm of sleet
at Ithaca, Friday. '

Percy Field has a seating capacity
of about 6,000. A structural steel
bleacher and .a number of antiquated
stands surround the gridiron.

The spectators at the Pitt games
at Forbes Field have a much better
view of the game than the audience
at Cornell’s Field, as but three men
are allowed in the side lines at Pitts-
burgh. Coaches, trainers, rubbers and
some substitutes wander up and down
the side lines at Percy Field.

in the latter part of the game.

Blair played his opponent, .Munns,
completely off his feet in Saturday’s
game and made several tackles be-

Cornell’s cheering is very good, the
favorite yell being: “Cornell, I yell,
yell, yell, Cornell!” .' _‘

tall grooting and all expected Pitt to

GOLD AND BLUE ELEVEN S
DEFEATED BY CORNELL

(Continued from Page 7)

The teams were about evently
matched in weight, Pitt being slightly
heavier perhaps, and Galvin outkicked
his opponent. Cornell was superior,
h'owever, in running back kicks as the
splendid blocking of their halfbacks
kept the Pitt ends from getting down
the ﬁeld. Cornell's ends were fast in
getting down the ﬁeld on kicks and
several times either recovered the
kick or nailed the Pitt runner in his
tracks. Eyrich is a strong, fast, heady
player, and the wa.y he followed up
O’Connor’s kicks was splendid. On
the defense he was hard to get by but
Brown made several good gains by
cutting in close to the tackle. Gass,
who played in the last quarter, also

. put up a good game.
Statistics show that Pitt gained 60”

yards on _line bucks, while Cornell
made 78 yards. Pitt gained 41 yards
on end plays against 14 by Cornell.
Capt. “Jack” Lindsay played a ﬁne
game for Pitt, the way he handled the
forward pass being a revelation to the
Cornell team. He was forced to re-
tire in the last quarter, but will be all
right by next Saturday. Smith, Leahy,
Stevenson, Blair and Gehlert did well
in the line and were able t'o stop Cor-
ne1l’s rushes in great shape.’ Graves

and Wagner did well at left end. De-

war and Connelly ran the teamnin

great shape, the former running back
several kicks when the fast Cornell
forwards had him boxed in. Quailey
played a good game at half, recover-
ing one of Galvin’s kicks and making
a 30-yard gain on a forward pass.
Brown and Feightnr-r tore off several
good gains, the former doing the most
of the gaining. Soles and Kernohan
did well when Lindsay and Feightner
were forced to retire.
