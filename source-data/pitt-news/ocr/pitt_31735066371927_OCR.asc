State holds hearing
on welfare cuts

By Kurt Welnschenker
The Pitt News

The problem of reduced federal
Title XX funds was the subject of
public hearings held by the state
House of Representatives at the Wil-
liam Pitt Union on March 2|.

Title XX funds, better known as
block grants, are federal monies
originally allocated under section
XX ofthe Social Security Act. How-
ever, the money for the program
came out of the federal budget, as
opposed to the Social Security Trust

Fund. The federal government gave

those funds to the states to provide a
variety of social services, such as
child care and meal preparation for
the elderly and handicapped.

Several social welfare agencies
presented testimony as part of the
ongoing state budget process. The
organizations may lose funding if
the Reagan administration’s 1986
budget is approved unchanged. The
Department of Health and Human
Services plans to cut $368 million in
community service grants and $25
million of social service grants in fis-
cal year 1986.

Accordingto Bill Stewart, Demo-
cratic state representative from
Cambria County and acting chair-
man of the hearing, the state legisla-
ture faces some tough decisions if
the federal government cuts the
amount of money for Title XX
programs.

“The agencies heavily dependent
on these grants will be in trouble if
they’re cut,” Stewart said. “Then,
the state legislature has a big deci-
sion to make: Do we make up the
difference with state monies? That‘s
why we're here today. We‘re trying

to ﬁgure out the funding levels of
these groups for the next fiscal year,
which begins July 1."

According to testimony given by
Jerlean Daniel of the Pennsylvania
Association of Child Care Agencies,
the quality of subsidized child care
has eroded. Daniel then quoted a
survey conducted by the association,
which stated that over 80 percent of
the respondents had either com-
pletely deleted or significantly
reduced the purchase of equipment
and supplies from their budgets.

Daniel urged, “At a minimum,
restore the $18 million taken from
child care. This represents a 14-
percent increase in rates. In light of
the last four years, the two-percent
increase proposed by the Depart-
ment of Public Welfare is insulting
at best.”

Margaret Cyert, chairman of the
Child Care Committee of the May-
or‘s Task Force on Women in
Renaissance II, also testified in
favor of increased aid for child care.
Cyert said that the average cost for
group infant care was $69 a week.

As another part of her testimony,
Cyert showed what happened to a
typical single working ’parent with
one infant who earned $15,000 a
year. After taxes, the parent’s pay
was $957 a month. When expenses
for rent and utilities, food and
household items, hospitalization,
transportation, clothes and miscel-
laneous necessities were deducted, a
total of $l28 was left for child care.
By contrast, four weeks of day care
for the average infant would cost
$299.

Cyert went on to say that the
Child Care Committee thought
more government money should be
allocated for day care services.

A similar public hearing was also
held in Philadelphia.

Grant will help,

Pitt’s Learning Research and Devel-
opment Center (LRDC) to continue
developing computer programs to
be used in the teaching of writing
and editing.

LR DC and Pitt‘s English depart-
ment are collaborating on a project
to develop software that will teach
writers to locate and correct mis-
takes in their compositions. The new
equipment will enable Pitt develop-

Pittsburgh executives get
involved in higher education

By Nadia Moritz
The Pitt News

From computer software instruc-
tion to laser chemistry lectures,
Pittsburgh’s corporate executives
are getting involved with education.

“It was wonderful to have the
chance to go ‘back and speak as
someone who had made it in the
business world," said Linda Burke,
one of ALCOA‘s coordinators for
Pittsburgh’s Partners in Education
Program and frequent corporate
lecturers at Taylor Allderdice High
School. ‘‘It seemed like the whole
thing had run full circle.” .

Allderdice and ALCOA are one
of the pairs in Pittsburgh’s Partners
in Education program, a program
that establishes direct and voluntary
involvement of business and indus-

try in public schools.

Corporate America, like the rest
of America, is once again realizing
the importance of educational excel-
lence. Financially troubled public
schools are looking beyond tax sup-
port to sustain their programs. Cor-
porations are realizing that quality
education is essential to their growth
and prosperity, and school person-
nel are using new technology and
corporate expertise as tools to
enhance secondary education
curriculum.

“Business is beginning to act on
the recognition that if it wants well-
educated employees, customers and
voters,” said John J. Creedon, presi-
dent of Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company, “it must participate in the
formulative advancement of the
public policy measures that are
necessary."

Across the country, 46,000 differ-
ent corporate sponsors are working

with 2,058 school districts to provide
students and teachers with a wide
variety of goods and services rang-
ing from equipment donations to
scholarships to lectures from com-
pany executives to on-the-job train-
ing. At the same time, the programs,
usually under the names Adopt-a-

School or Partners in Education,

provide young people with powerful
living examples of employees who
have succeeded in the real world.

Pittsburgh is the only city in the
nation to involve every one of its
public high schools with business.
The program was begun five years
ago by the Allegheny Conference on
Community Development, the
Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce
and the Board of Education. Pres-
ently, the program involves 12 high
schools, three middle schools and 31
corporations and non-profit com-
munity organizations.

The Pitt News, Monday, March 25, 1985

By Craig Mullen
The Pitt News

Nestor Allemendros, arguably
the world’s finest cinematogra-
pher [“Kramer vs. Kramer,”
“Sophie‘s Choice.” “Places in the
Heart" and “Days of Heaven,“
for which he received the
Academy Award] was on cam-
pus last Friday to screen his doc-
umentary film about repression
in Cuba.

“Improper Conduct" explores
the 25 years since Castro took
power in Cuba. The central met-
aphor of the film is the ambigu-
ous term “improper conduct."
What “improper conduct" is,
exactly, is open to anyone’s inter-
pretation. Lives are routinely
destroyed in Cuba because, just

Film explores repre

as in a novel by Kafka, the popu-
lation polices itself. Anti-social
behavior or personal extrava-
gance is routinely punished by
long stays in provincial work
camps.

Dictatorships seem to stimu-
late creativity in the artists of
those populations. Although this
film was made in a two-week
period, Allemendros manages to
bring high photographic quality,
poetic rhythm and a keen under-
standing and attention to the
problems of personal expression
and individuality in a socialist
society such as Cuba. This film
may center on Cuba. the country
from which Allemendros exiled
himself in the early 1960s, but its
message is universal and time-
less. Cuba is only 90 miles away
from the United States, and
repression can assert itself easily

 

 

anywhere and at any time.
Therefore, it is worthwhile for us
as citizens of an internationally
powerful country to take a look

at the situation that has been
documented so well by Allemen-
dros and his co-writer director,
Orlando Jimenez-Leal.

Grant will help computers teach

an Ethernet that will connect the
microcomputers into a common sys-
tem, two DECtalk systems and will
allow Pitt to make repairs on eight
other Pro350s. DECtalk is a text-to-
speech system that converts stan-
dard computer text into speech
which closely resembles the human
voice.

“The project is an exciting break-
through in the use of computers in
teaching,” said President Wesley W.
Posvar. “The English department
and LRDC are making great strides
in this pioneering work to develop
programs that are capable ofanalyz-
ing written compositions.” .

Robert F. Trocchi, manager of
the education computer systems of
Digital Equipment Corp., added,
“We are pleased to take part in areas
such as English where computers

haven’t traditionally been used."

According to Dr. Mary Louise
Briscoe, chairman of the English
department, an inter-disciplinary
team of experts in computers, lin-
guistics and artificial intelligence is
developing state-of-the-art research
in natural — as opposed to compu-
ter ——- language processing. “The
team is working on applications of
the most advanced computer tech-
nology for the teaching ofbasic writ-
ing," said Briscoe. “The project will
also provide advanced capabilities
for computer-assisted instruction in
other teaching areas as well as in
faculty research."

One of the new approaches
LRDC will examine is the use of
synthesized speech. Glynda Hull,
post-doctoral fellow and one ofthe
leaders of the project, said, “Some-
times people can detect errors better

when they hear a sentence read
aloud rather than when they read it.”
The voice synthesizers scan written
text and electronically reproduce it
as spoken words.

At the heart of the university's
research is the VAX minicomputer.
With this machine, LRDC will be
able to develop programs to do
instructionally-relevant parsing and
pattern-matching — much more
demanding tasks than the simple
checking of spelling that computers
are now capable of doing.

Pattern-matching is the finding of
errors by comparing patterns of cer-
tain parts of speech that writers fre-
quently misuse. Parsing is a complex
operation that attempts to identify
the part of speech for each word in a
sentence and then determine if the
entire sentence is grammatically cor-
rect. Because a parser requires a very

large dictionary and a set of gram-
mar rules for sentence structures, it
is only feasible for a large computer.

Most parsers now available, how-
ever, are designed to deal with syn-
tactically correct sentences. They
lack the ability to respond to errors
in ways that guide the student to
better performance. The goal of
Pitt’s project is to build a parser that
will not only detect errors but will
also guide the student to learn to
correct his own mistakes. Research
on parsing is directed by Lori Levin,
assistant professor of linguistics at
Pitt.

The University of Pittsburgh’s
Health and Wellness Day will take
place Thursday, March 28, from ll
a.m. to 4 p.m. in the William Pitt
Union. The annual event, sponsored
by the Student Health Service and
the Commuter Association, is open
to the public.

“In contrast to the traditional
health fair, students will be exposed
to exhibits that stress health promo-
tion themes rather than illness or
disease and are primarily interactive

The”Pitt’News,~ Monday, March 25,1985

Health fair will stress health

rather than passive," said Shirley
Haberman, a Pittsburgh health edu-
cator. She noted that fostering a
positive attitude toward taking per-
sonal responsibility for one‘s health
and well-being is a main objective
for the event.

Pitt students and the public will
participate in creative exhibits, u-
nique demonstrations and enjoyable
workshops that emphasize health
promotion themes such as aerobics,
self-esteem workshops and a bar
that serves non-alcoholic
“cocktails.” ”

Nutrition, accident prevention,
physical fitness and exercise are
some of the many topics of lifestyle
issues that will be emphasized dur-

ing Health and Wellness Day. Physi-
cal, social, emotional and spiritual
dimensions will be incorporated into
these activities to maximize personal
health attempts.

“We consider education to be an
important element in the primary
care for students. It is our aim that
students will have experiences that
will encourage them to modify
health practices,” said Franklin Car-
ter, director of Student Health
Services.

A number of student organiza-
tions will volunteer at the event. An
immunization booth will also be
available.

Hand in Hand

The University of Pittsburgh is many things to
many people. Some like the school for its sports
teams, others for its cultural events and still others
for the opportunity it provides for learning and per-
sonal growth. This «weekend, some students, faculty
and staff will be giving something in return for the
opportunities the university offers.

The 1985 Hand-in-Hand Festival is a non-profit
community service organized by undergraduate stu-
dents under the auspices of the Office of Residence
Life. The festival provides a full day of carnival
entertainment for 400 mentally and physically hand-
icapped children and a chance for the student volun-
teers to make a positive contribution to the

university community.

This festival, which has come to mean so much to
Greater Pittsburgh handicapped children, will be the-
seventh of its kind in as many years. The festival
games and stage shows are designed to allow the
children as much self-expression as possible. For
some, this may be the only extra-curricular recrea-
tional activity in which they can participate.

Once again, Mayor Richard Caliguiri has pro-
claimed the date as “Hand-in-Hand Festival day
throughout the city of Pittsburgh.” Honorary chair-
men of the festival this year will be former Pitts-
burgh Steeler Gabe Rivera, and current Steelers

Craig Bingham and Keith Willis.

A staff of 80 students works year-round to prepare
for this one-day burst of caring and affection. The
food and prizes, not to mention the hours of hard
work, are all donated in the spiritof caring.

The people who have taken the time to become
involved in the work for the past year would no
doubt say that the day of festivities and the smiles on
the children’s faces make the time well worth it. Still,
The Pitt News would like to acknowledge the work
of all students, faculty and staff of the university and
those corporations that have donated supplies.

Double Standard

I’m not angered. I’m not outraged

—— simply boggled. As time passes .

and stories become foggy, people
lose their keen perception of the
obvious. No one seems to care that
Craig Heyward attacked two stu-
dents and got away with it. Sure, he

’can’t play next year, nor can he live
in the residence halls, and also he
must perform community service.
That’s a nice gesture, but only a
gesture.

Take me, for instance, Joe Col-
lege. If I had a fight with a friend
which resulted in my abusing two
students to the extent that Mr. Hey-
ward did, I'd be handed my walking
papers with no questions asked.
However, Mr. Heyward is a quality
running back, an asset to the univer-
sity. He is here on a football scholar-
ship. Nobody is so good that the
Panther team couldn't do without
him — besides, we recruited the No.
1 running back in the country. I
really don’t want a dangerous per-
son running around assaulting as he
pleases, knowing he will only get a
slap on the hand.

It was said that Mr. Heyward
didn’t have intent to hurt anybody.
So what! The damage was done. Be
it a mistake or not, out in the real
world, people pay for mistakes.

The student/ student-athlete dou-
ble standard must cease. The Hey-
ward incident is just one example of
the athletic misconduct that has
been and continues to be permitted
at Pitt. There should be a code of
conduct for students with no excep-
tions, and this code must be en-
forced.

I'm glad Coach Fazio won't “tol-
erate that kind of behavior” any-
more. It's a step in the right
direction.

State of

t h e Union

As you mav well be aware. the
Student Government Board has, for
the past two weeks, been dealing
with a very sensitive issue concern-
ing the Rev. Farrakhan. By making
a decision on this issue, many ques-
tions have been raised. First, are we
representing the students? Should
the Rev. Farrakhan be allowed to
speak here at the university? And
ﬁnally, is this, in fact, a misuse ofour
activities fee?

In response, first, we are elected to
serve two purposes. That is, we are
elected first to represent all under-
graduate (non-CGS) students and
second to make decisions. These
decisions are based on accurate
information, policy (to which we are

bound) as well as the laws that gov-
ern the university. So, when repre-
senting the students, we must, in
fact, stand for freedom of speech. If
there is one place to express all ideas,
it must be the university campus. It
must be preserved in the university
environment.

According to the Mission of the
University of Pittsburgh statement,
we have to “provide a forum for the
interchange of ideas and an oppor-
tunity to discuss and debate. This
must be done in an atmosphere free
from fear, intimidation and censor-
ship. It is the responsibility under all
circumstances to protect the basis of
American education.”

While it may be desirable that the
Rev. Farrakhan not speak here, it is
essential to the integrity of the uni-
versity and the students that he not
be precluded the opportunity to
speak because of personal or politi-
cal views. From “The Law and the
College Student” under the “Guide-
lines for Free Expression,” “Sup-
pression of discussion makes a
rational judgment impossible. In
effect, it substitutes force for logic.
Moreover, suppression of expres-
sion conceals the real problems con-
fronting a society. It is likely to
result in neglect of the grievances
that are the actual basis for unrest,
and thus prevent their correction.”

On the question of a misuse of the
student activities fee, let me describe
the methodology of the allocations
process. Student activities fees are
university funds. The university
developed this methodology with
SGB, PPC and Media and Publica-
tions based on an agreement of pol-
icy on how to allocate. The
university’s three main concerns
when developing this policy were
that the fees be distributed in a fair,
equitable and unbiased fashion.

So, the allocations policy is an
agreement between the university
and SGB in which the university
delegates the power to allocate to the
SGB, and shares the responsibility
of fairness and equity. Therefore, if
the SGB were to make a decision
outside the parameter of the policy
(i.e., by allowing social, religious,
political and philosophical viewsto
deny that freedom of speech), it
would violate the trust based on this
agreement and may indeed invali-
date the decision.

Going back to the “Guidelines for
Free Expression," “Freedom of
expression is not merely the per-
sonal right of individuals to have his
or her say; it also means the right for
the rest of us to hear them. In other
words, the First Amendment pro-
tects the communication itself and

right a::=d accommodated the Iran-
ian students a forum to express their
support of the Ayatollah and the
taking of the hostages. On a per-
sonal basis, it was hard to rationalize
this event in view of the hostile acts
toward fellow citizens. However, it
was again the university’s responsi-

bility to provide the open forum for *

free expression.

In closing, I’d like to quote John
Stuart Mills’ “Essay on Liberty”:
“The peculiar evil of silencing the
expression of opinion is that it is
robbing the human race  If the
opinion is right, they are deprived of
the opportunity of exchanging error
for truth; if wrong, they lose what is
almost as great a benefit, the clearer
perception and lovelier impression
of truth, produced by its collision
with error.” .

In other words, allowing the Rev.
Farrakhan the opportunity to speak
can be a very positive thing. This will
give every student on this campus
the opportunity to experience and
see for himself the ugliness of
racism. I believe this is an educa-
tional experience we can all use.

N o Human

Decency

Unbelievably, this is the third time
(that we know of) that Judge J.

Quint,Salmon has set an alleged _

child molester free under preposter-
ous circumstances. I am dismayed
beyond words that this judge was
even given the opportunity to hurt a
child again. He should have been

removed the last time. It may be that ,

cases are so overloaded that we
needed to bring in a 78-year-old
judge from another county who has
no answering to the voters of Alle-
gheny County, no answering to any
human decency, and this man is still
hearing sensitive cases even after the
controversies of ‘82 and ‘83. But
there can be no defense or explana-
tion of this atrocity. This is insanity!

Just imagine that it was your 13-
year-old daughter or your little sis-
ter; imagine the fear, the terror of a
child raped and beaten in the back
seat of a car at night, and then to
have the rapist set scot-free without
even a trial. Salmon has clearly dem-
onstrated a contempt for the victims
of child sexual abuse, clearly hold-
ing some problem against convicting
an adult male of molesting a child, as
evidenced by his behavior in the
three Allegheny County cases. All
three had overwhelmingly strong
cases against the men, and at least
two of the men had previous convic-

continued from page four
tions of child abuse.

Maybe even more disturbing are
Salmon‘s tough—talking comments
to the prosecution, “It is a lawyer’s
responsibility to have their witnesses
in court, and they ought to know
that by now.” Incredibly, Salmon is
also acting from some personal
quarrel with the lawyers and the
assistant district attorney. The
police had done thejob, the prosecu-
tors had the case together, but the
judge purports to teach them a les-
son by sending the rapist home free
because the victim was a half-hour
late. This total lack of caring or
responsibility is a clear demonstra-
tion of incompetence, or at best,
senility.

It is difficult to take action against
a bad judge, because they learn to
use and abuse their great-power to
protect themselves. In Grant
County, Wisconsin, a petition for
recall was registered against Circuit

Judge William L. Reinecke. Rei-~

necke let a defendant go with just
work release for the rape of a five-
year-old girl, stating “I am satisfied
we have an unusually sexually pro-
miscuous young lady, and he did not
know enough to refuse.” If Salmon
does not resign immediately, a peti-
tion for recall will be filed and the
whole shaming procedure followed.
I wish we could have Salmon locked
up with the alleged rapists and child
molesters that he has set free.

He is clearly unfit to sit at the
bench, clearly unfit to protect our
children. I don’t want him presiding
over any more cases. He has setjus-
tice back far enough and caused
enough pain and suffering. The
judge’s power of discretion in shap-
ing the law and legal climates has
been wantonly abused, and it’s our
little children who pay for keeping

him on the bench. If it was Salmon’s a

little daughter that was raped and
beaten, he would never have allowed
this travesty. But this was just a girl
from the poor town of Braddock
and this judge from Beaver County
has shown that he doesn’t care one
thing about her or her suffering.
Look at your kid sister tonight, then
think of Salmon setting her rapist
free out of some senile, irresponsible
whim. Sexual abuse is the ultimate
betrayal of the trust of a little child.

Moral
Helpless ness

Call me a young, idealistic fool. I
guess I just haven’t lived long
enough to be numbed by people not

. caring at all for one another.

Recently, Judge Salmon decided
to dismiss a rape case because the
13-year-old victim was about 20
minutes late for her court appear-
ance. His justification: “The court
runs on aschedulejust like any other
business.” Yeah, that says it all.

Salmon is no slouch when it
comes to making profound state-
ments. In 1983, he dismissed a child
molestation case because the moles-

ter was the child's grandfather.
Incest, he posits, is better handled by
the family. Mmm Hmm. Is it my
imagination, or is incest, by deﬁni-
tion, a problem with the family
itself. Gosh, maybe Grandma just
wasn’t putting out any more. You
know men — they can get a little

‘ frisky.

I’m not one to become “enraged”
very often, but this ‘is disgusting!
Sorry for the emotion; Ijust feel so
helpless. I've called the district attor-
neyand found out where to register
a formal complaint. I will write a
letter, but what good will it do? It
doesn’t change the fact that a girl
was raped and a four-year-old child
was molested. Their lives have been
unalterably scarred.

We’re told everyday to work
within the system. “Laws are there to
protect us.” These people turned to
the courts for help — and got
nothing.

Legitimate
Speaker

As a student, I feel compelled to
respond to the letters written by
Zachary Grayson and the writers of
“Hate Basillus.”

The letters were extremely hypo-
critical as well as paradoxical. In
Mr. Grayson’s article, he stated
there comes a time when we should
reject quiet diplomacy and utilize
our Constitutional rights, that is,'the
Fifth Amendment. However, he
later stated that in having the minis-
ter Louis Farrakhan as a speaker
would serve no purpose. Mr. Gray-

son, since youeclaim that you believe _

in freedom of speech, then why
shouldn’t Mr. Farrakhan speak?

If I’m not mistaken, the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh is an educational
institution, and of course education
is the primary issue. Therefore, hav-
ing Mr. Farrakhan as a speaker
would serve an educational purpose,
regardless of our beliefs or
disbeliefs.

In the “Hate Basillus” letter, the
writers underestimate the entire stu-
dent population. Racism is a fact
that does exist, and is something
that we have to deal with. Therefore,
it should be taught that it exists. We
are not partisans in any psychologi-
cal experiment in which we need
positive methods’ of education.
What we need is first-hand educa-
tion, and Mr. Farrakhan serves that
purpose.

For the last few weeks, the Black
Action Society has been accused of
being racist, -anti-Semitic and of
being insensitive, when in essence
they are pro-education.

Finally, if anyone is going to
accuse anyone of being racist, a self-
evaluation is recommended, espe-
cially when we preach equality. We
should practice it in our writing.

Youth as Urban Predator

Did you ever step on an ant
when you‘were a kid?

I've stepped on more ants in
my lifetime than’ probably
anyone else in the world. In addi-
tion to this I’ve swatted ﬂies,
fumigated wasps, terrorized
everything from chickens to our
family cat and yes, I used to cap-
ture ﬁreﬂies only so I could get
my hands on that stuff that they
use to make themselves glow.

I've been an utter terror to all
those things that it’s cool for
your basic American kid to be a
terror to. Through all the violent
deaths and dreadful fears I've
brought to helpless creatures, no
one has said a word. It would
seem that as long as Huck Finn
did it, or would have considered
doing it, any sort of mischievous
thing I did was OK in the watch-
ful eye of my elders.

So the other day, this 15-year-
old kid whipped a rock at a ﬂa-
mingo and ripped its legs off. My
first reaction was to hope some-
one made darn sure that whoever
the violent cretin was would get
his legs ripped off. It’s funny how
quickly one can start quoting
Bible scripture about things like
“an eye for an eye and so on.
It was a ﬂamingo, for God’s sake.

When I was younger, we had

three horses thatleveryone in the
family pretty much shared. My
sister was in charge of them and
held the most sustained interest
in them, but I would occasionally
wander over to the barn and
spend a little time with them.
One of the animals was a Shet-
land pony by the name of Smo-
key. Now, Smokey had this
incredible ability to ignore, or on
bad days, revolt against any
order I gave when I rode him. I’d
want to go to the left; he’d go to
the right. I'd want to stop; he’d
keep on going. I'd want to get
going; he’d sit there like a rock.
Smokey also had this kind of
laid-back attitude. When he
wouldn’t move, I’d just get
jmadder and madder,.until I was
thumping him in the sides with
all the force I could muster.
About all he’d do was breathe a
little harder. If the thumping
really got on his nerves he’d turn
around and snap at me. This
would infuriate me, of ‘course,
and I’d kick him some more. It
got to be that after a while, I’d
wish for nothing more than to see
that good-for-nothing, lazy, dis-
respectful pony running to beat
hell.
One sunny, summer after-
noon, I spied Smokey standing

half asleep under the shade of a
tree. It galled me that this animal
could actually be tired. I finally
decided that he had been lazy
long enough. It was time for him
to run. And it was time for me to
watch him run.

So I picked up this rock 

A ﬂamingo is a bird. That’s
what they teach you in school.
They also teach you that ‘birds
are supposed to ﬂy. According to
what I read, the young man
wanted to see the bird ﬂy. Per-
haps there was some other
motive. Perhaps he didn’t want
to see it ﬂy. Maybe he wondered
how those skinny legs can keep
anything standing.

So he picked up this rock 

Now, I’m not saying that
"either of us was right. I received
fair punishment for what I did
and so should he. But I have to
say that no one else has ever
stood me under a tree and hurled
rocks. That young man did a vio-
lent, disrespectful, stupid thing.
But before you set yourselves up.
as judges too quickly and per-
manently ostracize this kid, take
a quick look in the mirror.

He's got a long, human life
ahead of him. I wish him the best
of luck. As for the ﬂamingo, I’m
sorry.

According to program coordina-
tor Jeanne Berdik, Pittsburgh’s pro-
gram is different from most of the
districts’ across the country. “Many
programs like Adopt-a-School are
limited to a direct service involve-
ment. This program makes an effort
to include the business in a number
of different levels and in more than
one department,” said Berdik. “Our
program is based more on human
relationships. Money donations are
secondary.”

Pittsburgh’s Partners in Educa-

tion Program involved the schools‘

and businesses on two different lev-
els. The first level is a one-to-one
partnership. A school and a business
are paired according to the needs of
the school and the resources of the
business, and together they formu-
late goals and objectives and design
the curriculum. They also try to get
assistant partners, which are com-
panies _that may offer specific
resources to students throughout the
district.

“What we have been trying to set
up with ALCOA is a situation that
will give to students and teachers a
window to the real world,” said
Allderdice’s information director,
Doris Littman, “and to utilize the
expertise of practicing professionals
in helping to see how the subject can
help prepare students.”

The goals and activities between
Allderdice and ALCOA, according
to Littman, have fluctuated during
the three years that the pair has been
involved. For the first two years, the
partnership concentrated on famil-
iarizing the teachers with the pro-
gram. Now, the efforts have changed
to include the students more often.
Some of the student-ALCOA activi-
ties have included mock interviews,
lectures from company executives,
shadow days (one-to-one
employee/student field trips) and
monthly donations of certain equip-
ment, including vinyl binders, draft-
ing tables, design tables, old journals
and calculators. ALCOA also spon-

The Pitt News, Monday, March 25, 1985

Pittsburgh executives get involved in education

sors an academic letter program,
rewarding students of academic
excellence with a material letter, and
this year they donated $5,000 to
cover the expenses of Allderdice’s
annual jog-athon, held to benefit the
various school activities.

Teacher activities have consisted
of stress and time utilization work-
shops, as well as shadow days and
summer project employment pro-
grams. J. Michael Shore, a physics
and computer science teacher at
Allderdice, spent last summer work-
ing on a physics experiment with
ALCOA engineers.

“It’s given me a different form of
reference to talk to the kids," said
Shore. “Now I can talk about engi-
neering in the sense of what sort of
things a company might use with a
physics or computer background.”

The science department at Allder-
dice is also involved in a Saturday
morning lecture series on subjects
like nuclear science, laser chemistry
and enzymes. Involved students take
a test at the end ofthe series, and the
two highest scorers are given
summer jobs at Westinghouse.

Recruiting corporate volunteers
for educational programs has posed
difficulties in many parts of the
country. Dallas, for example,
spends roughly $250,000 a year on
“tea and luncheon talks" to entertain
and encourage corporate volun-
teers. In Richmond, Va., the respon-
sibilities of the educational staffs
include recruiting business volun-

,teers at the local chamber of com-

merce. The recruiting of businesses

has not posed a problem to the pro-

gram in Pittsburgh, however,
“The recruiting methods differ

according to the type of community. .

We simplyconsider a school’s needs
and then investigate and inquire
about the organization we feel ﬁts
these goals,” said Berdik. “So far,
that method has worked successfully
in Pittsburgh. Most organizations
have stayed with the program since
they’ve enlisted.”

1 government

Since education/corporation
partnership programs rely on busi-
nesses rather than the taxpayers for
resources, it allows the possibility
for misuse. In Denver, for example,
one company lectured students
against the evils oflabor unions and
intervention, and a
Richmond company was showing
students’ films intended for advertis-
ing purposes. But in Pittsburgh,
according to Berdik, any potential
propaganda has been filtered out by
the design of the system, and as a
result, problems have remained
minimal.

Joyce Clarke, Brashear High
School’s coordinator of its partner-
ship with Westinghouse, noticed a
problem with the conflicting sche-
dules of the educational and busi-
ness worlds.

“It takes a lot of time and work to
coordinate two entirely different
worlds,” said Clarke. “I think the
business world is just beginning to
realize the differences of a world
totally run by the bell.”

Some of the activities that West-
inghouse has sponsored ‘or Bra-
shear include letters of encourage-
ment to students with perfect attend-
ance, sponsoring an essay contest
and sending the two winners to
Europe, and speaker and mentor
programs. With the goal to amelio-
rate the problem of ninth grade fail-
ures, Clarke said that they are
planning a project to begin in Janu-
ary that will involve the retired
employees of Westinghouse in tutor-
ing and reward sessions with the
ninth graders.

Roe Collins, one of ALCOA’s
coordinators in its partnership with
Allderdice, noticed another problem
with the project. “Our biggest prob-
lem is that we have to make sure that
the right students are matched with
the right executives,” said Collins.
“We want to make sure that the
experience is a meaningful one."

William Kohler, last year’s head
coordinator at Langley High School
of its partnership with Pittsburgh

Plate and Glass Indestries, had his
doubts when the program was first
introduced. “We were one ofthe first
schools to get involved in the pro-
gram, but in the beginning we were
skeptical,” said Kohler. “PPG was
trying to get the property for their
building downtown, and we thought
their involvement was just a public-

ity effort  but that was totally
opposite. We‘ve had excellent
relations.”

As Berdik also affirmed, the
responses of Pittsburgh‘s businesses
with the schools have been charac-
terized by a growing sense of com-
mitment to the community.

“The strength of any community 5

is directly proportional to the
strength of its school system,” said
Berdik. “Business is becoming more
and more aware of the fact that the
educational system is the source of
their future work force and consu-
mers and that they have a vested
interest in the quality of this consu-
mer group.”

Stanton Williams, board chair-
man of PPG Industries, agrees. “It is
good business for business to streng-
then public schools,” he said at a
forum for business and education
last month in Pittsburgh. “Good
schools provide well-trained
workers and a good economy."

Another benefit that the corpora-
tions have noticed is employee
morale, which has risen considera-

bly in many ofthe nation‘s compan-
ies that are involved in educational
partnership programs.

This rise in morale is also evident
in Pittsburgh. “I’m excited,” said
ALCOA coordinator Linda Burke,
“and I think this is the reaction
throughout the company. _There are
more and more people in the com-
pany who want to get involved.”

Langley’s coordinator, Cherri
Banks, agrees. “It’s all positive," said
Banks. “It gives our school district
more credibility, and it forces more
of the Pittsburgh community to look
more closely at what is going on in
our schools.”

The program has so far seemed to
benefit everyone involved. Industry
can locate numerous bright, future
employees, and students can get a
realistic picture of the job market.
The teachers benefit not only
through the part-time positions
offered by the companies but also by
the fact that business represents a
potential ally in promotion of a bet-
ter image for teachers and in lobby-
ing for bigger school budgets. At the
Pittsburgh public education system,
dropout rates are down, attendance
is up, and businesses are eager to get
involved.

“I think that the directed contact
of kids and adults in an educational
setting is extremely healthy for
both," said Berdik. ‘“That’s what’
makes it all worth it.”

House will vote on Thursday on
whether to let the Pentagon have
the funds. That procedure was
used last week in the Senate,
where both MX votes passed by
55-45 margins.

President Reagan has been
lobbying for the MX in both
parts of Congress, arguing that
defeat of the weapon will sabot-
age the U.S. position in the cur-
rent arms control talks with the
Soviets.

That reasoning reversed some
MX foes in the Senate last week,
and that same argument could
reverse votes in the House.
White House Chief of Staff
Donald Regan said that the
House vote is very close because

the Democratic leadership sud-
denly began lobbying against the
MX. Until now, the White
House said, the Democrats had
promised not to transform the
MX into a partisan issue.

Opponents argue that the wea-
pon would be virtually useless in
underground silos. They believe
the MX system is wasteful and
unnecessary.

Roth supporters
arrested

CLAIRTON, Pa. (UPI) — At -

least six people were arrested
yesterday when they tried to hold
a communion service on the side-
walk in front of the closed Trin-
ity Lutheran Church in Clairton.
Clairton police were on scene,
but the arrests were made by dep-
uties of the Allegheny County
sheriff.

A spokesman for the Denomi-
national Ministry Strategy,
which supports the church's
defrocked pastor, Douglas Roth,
said that those arrested were
members of the disbanded con-
gregation’s council. They were
identified as Harry Dinkel, his

In Brief

wife Iva, DMS lawyer John
Macellaro, council member
Becky Fosbrink and her two
teenage sons.

The church has been closed
since late last year after Roth was
jailed for disobeying orders to
stop preaching. DMS spokes-
man Charles Honeywell said that
Clariton Police Chief Ken Uje-
vich refused to tell the communi-
cants why they couldn’t hold
their service on the sidewalk.

There was no comment availa-
ble from Clairton police or the
sheriff’s office.

Car costs rise

(UPI) — A new study is out on
the cost of driving a car, and it
shows that drivers spent nearly
seven percent more in I984 than
they did in I983.

The Hertz Corporation study
released yesterday found that the
average cost of owning and oper-
ating a new compact car rose 6.6
percent last year in America's 20
biggest cities.

That- translates to nearly 50
cents a mile or about $5,000 a
year.

the nation as the most expensive

The figures include purchase

Baby's death
declared
homicide

PHILADELPHIA (UPI) —
Authorities ruled that the death
of a newborn baby born to a 15-
year—old girl and discovered bur-
ied in a shallow grave was a
homicide.

A spokesman for the city’s
medical examiner‘s office said
yesterday that the infant girl died
of multiple injuries to the head
and neck. The autopsy also
showed that the infant weighed
about seven pounds at birth.

Police are investigating to
determine whether to press
charges against the teenage
mother, whose name is being
withheld by police due to her age.

Police said that a man identi-
fying himself as the girl’s father
told them where the body could
be found. They discovered the
body in a shallow grave in a west
Philadelphia alley.

lnconuaumt
cheaﬁng
abundant

(UPI) — This may come as a
surprise to many Americans, but
a survey done for the Internal
Revenue Service showed that 20
percent of American taxpayers
admit to cheating on their
income tax returns.

The survey, which was
reported in the April issue of
Psychology Today, polled 2,000
people last summer.

The most common reason
given for cheating was that the
“tax system is unfair.” That
excuse was cited by 25 percent of
the respondents.

Another 23 percent said that
they ‘cheat because “they can get
away with it,” 19 percent because
“everyone else does it" and 15
percent because they “don't like
or can’t control how their money
is being spent.”

The article said that many of
those questioned were tolerant of
cheating even if they themselves
did not cheat.

Survey results showed that 76
percent of those questioned said
that it’s acceptable not to report
goods or services traded with a
friend. Forty percent approved
of not reporting small amounts
of outside income.

OFFENSE

SPLIT END — There will be young
but talented people at the spot this
year. Sophomore Dwayne Milloy,
who was bothered by injuries last
season, will be counted on, as will
sophomore Mike Steward. “This is a
spot where we will have to take a
good look during the spring,” said
Fazio. “Dwayne and Mike can both
catch the ball and have excellent
speed. It's a matter of them gaining
game experience.” Also battling for
the job will be sophomore Dexter
Hairston and sophomore Mark
Stanton, both of whom were
bothered with injuries last season.
Redshirt freshman Tony Williams
will join the battle in the fall after
sitting out the spring for disciplinary
reasons. Gone is Jeff Casper, who
had ll catches for I37 yards in I984.

EICJCIDEJ

FLANKER — Juniors Chuck
Scales and Matt Stennett will be
counted on heavily and should be
improved over a year ago. Scales
was Pitt's second-leading receiver
last season with 22 catches for 431
yards and two touchdowns. Stennett
had five receptions for 74 yards a
year ago. “Chuck Scales returns and
he did a good job for us last season
after he made the transition from
halfback to receiver,” said Fazio. “If
Matt Stennett reaches his potential,
we could have two real good players
at this position.” Stennett will miss
spring drills while playing for the
Pitt baseball team. Depth at this

The Pitt News, Monday, March 25, 1985

spot will come from the same players
listed above at the split end position.
Pitt's record-setting receiver of the
past two years, Bill Wallace, is gone
and will need to be replaced.

DCIEICICI

OFFENSIVE LINE — Under the
leadership of offensive line coach
Joe Moore, this area of the team has
traditionally been a strong point.
Six lettermen return along the offen-
sive front; however, missing will be
two important figures from last
year’s line. Three-time All—America
tackle Bill Fralic is gone, as is guard
Greg Christy, a talented performer
when he was healthy. Junior Randy
Dixon is expected to pick up where
Fralic left off, while senior Tony
Brown, who started at guard some
last season, will hold down the other
tackle spot. Senior Barry Pettyjohn,
who started at both guard and center
in ’84, will concentrate on guard,
while senior starter Mike Dorundo
will be at the other slot. Sophomores
Ed Miller and Bob Sign will battle at
center, and both were starters at
times last season. Redshirt freshman
Tom Ricketts will battle at tackle, as
will former defensive tackle Chuck
Williams, a redshirt sophomore, and
redshirt freshman John Matarazzo.
Sophomore Scott Costy, junior
Andy Lewis and redshirt freshman
Jim Zdelar will provide depth at
guard. ,

“Miller and Sign both played a lot
last season at center, and I feel good
about that position,” said Fazio.

“Durondo and Pettyjohn are expe-
rienced at guard, as are Dixon and
Brown at tackle. Fralic and Christy
will be tough to replace, but hope-
fully these people will be able to pick
it up." Fazio also had a good year
recruiting linemen and some of
those freshmen may provide depth.

CICIEJDD

TIGHT END — Redshirt senior
Clint Wilson would have been
counted on heavily last year, but he
broke his foot during fall camp and
missed the year. Wilson is back, and
he is bigger and stronger than in ’83,
when he had a fine season. Junior
Pat Schipani, who caught nine
passes for 72 yards and a touch-
down, and sophomore°Dave Shuck
gained valuable experience last sea-
son and should be a plus this year.
Senior Bob Lawson will also pro-
vide depth. “It looks as if Wilson,
Schipani and Shuck all have the
equipment and experience to make
this a better position for us than last
year,” said Fazio.

CIEIDDEI

FULLBACK —- Fazio is confident
that senior Darnell Stone andjunior
Tom Brown have the abilities to
replace Marc Bailey and Marlon
Mclntyre, who manned this spot the
past two years. Last season, Stone
carried the ball 24 times for 118
yards and a touchdown and caught
eight passes for 47 yards and a

touchdown. Brown’s playing time
was limited because ofinjury, but he
did gain 48 yards on 12 carries and
catch two passes for 18 yards. Said
Fazio, “Replacing Marlon and
Marc will be difficult; however,
Stone and Brown have the speed and
size and will hopefully gain the expe-
rience to help.” Redshirt freshman
Vernon Kirk has been moved from
defensive end to fullback and will
hopefully help.

CICIEIDCI

TAILBACKS — Sophomore start-
er Charles Gladman, the team’s
second-leading rusher with 525
yards on 134 carries, will be back to
improve on those totals. Gladman
rushed for a touchdown, in addition
to catching eight passes for 75 yards.
Depth could be a problem here
because sophomore Craig Heyward,
last year’s leading rusher, will miss
the season for disciplinary reasons.
“Charles Gladman proved he can
run last year," said Fazio. “With a
year’s experience, he should be that
much better.” The players Fazio will
be counting on for depth are sopho-
more Ezekial Gadson, redshirt
freshman A.B. Brown, and redshirt
sophomore Billy Owens. All three
players are talented but have little
experience, and their progress has
been hindered because ofinjuries. In
addition, highly-recruited Brian
Davis from Washington, Pa., will
join the team in the fall when he and
his fellow freshmen report to Pitt,
and there will be high expectations

Pitt offense looking for bigger plays, more points in ’85

for the Parade Magazine Co-Player
of the Year.

CICIIZIEIEI

QUARTERBACK — Senior John
Congemi will be looking to have a
better season staying away from
injuries. He was not completely
healthy for any game last year, but
he turned in an outstanding perfor-
mance against Penn State when he
was as physically fit as he had been
all year. The Penn State game
brought back memories of the fine
1983 season Congemi had. Congemi
finished ‘S4 with 93 completions in
174 attempts for 1,102 yards, seven
interceptions and nine touchdowns.
Seniors Chris Jelic and John Cum-
mings each played a great deal last
season, and will provide depth, as
will sophomore Joe Felitsky, a
transfer from Notre Dame who is
eligible after sitting out a year.
“John Congemi, when healthy, has
demonstrated that he is an excellent
quarterback,” said Fazio. “We feel
John can provide us with the leader-
ship we need to have a successful
offense. Cummings and Jelic return,
and we will take a good look at Joe
Felitsky. Redshirt freshman Bill
Osborn has been switched back to
quarterback.” Jelic will miss spring
drills while playing for the Pitt base-
ball team.

Same old Pirates?

By Jim Bmeckner
The Pitt News

Sunday afternoon in the early
spring is usually a pleasant time.
That is, as long as you don’t live in
Pittsburgh. Not only has it been
rather cool lately, but the Pirates
haven’t exactly set the baseball
world on fire with their preseason
antics. Yesterday, they dropped a 6-
2 decision to the Philadelphia
Phillies.

That brings their record to 1-10.
They have suffered eight losses in a
row in the sunshine state.

The Lumber Company may
someday be the subject of an “In
Search Of” episode if the Pirates
don’t start to put some runs on the
board. They have scored an embar-

rassing 28 runs in 11 games.

If the Pirate faithful think that
they have reason to feel embarrassed
because of their team’s record, just
think how the Pirates must feel los-
ing games. They know what it is like
to have salt poured into an open
wound.

In a game against the Cincinnati
Reds, a Pirate ghost left room for a
few nightmares. Apparently, player-
manager Pete Rose is not having
much difficulty with Dave Parker,
something that Chuck Tanner could
never claim. Rose has “the Cobra”
back to his old playing weight of
230, and he unleashed him on the
Pirates. In a 6-2 loss Friday, Parker
launched a towering three-run
homer against his former team.

Saturday's game wasn’t much bet-
ter. Not only did the Pirates lose 2-1
to the Chicago White Sox, but they

The Pitt News

For some college students, the
money brought in by a part—timejob
is needed to continue their educa-
tion. Holding ajob on top of study-
ing and classes, compounded by
belonging to one of Pitt‘s varsity
teams, can be especially difficult.
Two members of the Pitt men’s div-
ing team, Jack Shuten and Todd
Mulzet, qualified for the. one-meter
diving event and will be representing
Pitt this weekend at the NCAA
Championships in Texas. Shuten, a
native of Rochester, N.Y., receives a
small scholarship as a member ofthe
diving team but Mulzet will be one
of the few divers at the NCAA’s not
on a scholarship. Both Shuten and
Mulzet hold part—time jobs to help
finance their educations, and both
spend 15 to 21 hours a week practic-
ing at Trees Pool.

“lt’s a difficult situation. You do
what you have to do to get by,” said
Pitt diving coach Julian Krug. “Both
of them are literally busting their
fannies to make ends meet. It‘s really
not at all what they deserve.”

Their devotion to diving has paid
off: Mulzet and Shuten have become
the first Pitt divers to qualify for
NCAAs in four years. “We’re pre-
pared — as prepared as we’re going
to be,” commented Mulzet. “We
hope to place well. We’re shooting
for the Top 15. The ultimate goal is
to go there and make Top 12.”

Mulzett attended the NCAAs last
year as an alternate in the three-
meter diving event, but he did not
compete. Neither Mulzet nor

on the one-meter dive.

Dave Hooker/ The Pitt News

Jack Shuten qualiﬁed for the NCAA championships

Shuten have ever competed in
NCAAs or Senior Nationals before,
and this will be their first major com-
petition. “You just don’t expect big
things from people in their first big
competition,” said Krug. “We’re
aiming for Top 16 placement, which
is vaguely realistic in the first place
and a dream goal in the second
place. In reality, it’s going to be a
tough one. I’m not saying we don’t
have a chance to score or become
All-America, I'm just saying it’s
going to be tough.”

Mulzet and Shuten will find their
most difficult task in overcoming
their exposure to the NCAA compe-
tition. “Our sport is not judged by
stop watches. If you’ve had expo-
sure, you’re going to get a break

from the judges,” Krug said. “These
guys do not have any exposure, so
they’re not going to get any breaks
that way.”

The Pitt diving team practices
three hours a day and anywhere
from five to seven days a week
depending on the upcoming compe-
tition. The year-round training has
brought forth a very successful
team, and the goal of sending part of
that team to the NCAAs has been
achieved. “Jack and Todd wouldn‘t
be where they are ifthey didn’t have
a solid team around them,” stated
Krug. “The other divers -— John
Dusch, Chris Blair, Mark McCor-
mick and Mike McCalley — as well
as the women's team, all had to pull
together for us to get as far as we did.
We always look ‘at this as a team
sport. Everybody pulls for each
other.”

If either or both divers make Top
15, they will not only bring recogni-
tion to Pitt, they will also return with
another spot for an additional Pitt
diver to attend the pre—qualifiers
next year. Shuten and Mulzet will be
leaving tomorrow for Texas, and the
one-meter diving competition will
be held Thursday. According to
Mulzet, making Top 12 may be the
“ultimate goal,” but it is not an unat-
tainable one. “It’s a long shot right
now. lt’s hard to just walk in there
and place,” said Mulzet. “I’m
psyched. This is the first time any of
us has made nationals. Jack and I
will be representing the whole swim-
ming and diving team from
Pittsburgh.”

Katie Monoghan ponders her first regional cham-
pionship, which Pitt is hosting.

 

Monoghan adjusting well as
Lady Panther gymnast

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

A nervous excitement is not an
unusual feeling for a freshman to
have when pondering her partici-
pation in the Northeast Regional
Women’s Gymnastics Cham-
pionship, , especially when one

__considers that the event is only

four days away. The tournament
is being held at Fitzgerald Field
House on Friday at 7 p.m.

‘‘I’m a little scared,” admitted
freshman Katie Monoghan. “All
the best teams will be there -
Ohio State, Penn State, New
Hampshire. Rhode Island is the
only team we haven‘t competed
against, so we know what to
expect, but everyone will have to
hit their routines.”

Monoghan’s coach, Donna
Sanft, said the rookie gymnast is
“very talented, with powerful
legs; she’s fast and dynamic.”

Monoghan, a native of
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., specializes in
the vault and the floor exercise.
Her top scores for these events
include an 8.75 on the vault and
an 8.5 on the floor exercise.

These two events involve a con-
siderable amount of running and
jumping, requiring muscular leg
strength. Monoghan said that
there are not any Mary Lou Ret-
tons on the team, but that Kristy
Pieters and Alisa Spector have
difficult flips in their routines.
This dangerous combination
of running and jumping often

‘tests the stability ofthe lower leg.

For Monoghan, a consequence
of the constant pounding was a
stress fracture, which is a more
gradual type of injury than the
“clean” break, but equally debili-
tating. Monoghan was kept out
of competition for a month.

However, the gymnast main-
tains that she has recovered from
the injury and is ready for region-
als. “I’ve been working on the
floor the entire time, so I
shouldn’t be rusty — at least, I
hope not,” Monoghan
explained. She said that her floor
routine has improved since she’s
been here but that she isn‘t plan-
ning major changes for Friday‘s
competition. “My dances
change, but the tumbling stays
the same.”

Sophomore Alisa Spector said
that Monoghan has become
more outgoing since joining the

‘‘I’ve been working on
the ﬂoor the entire time,
so I shouldn ‘the rusty —
at least, I hope not. ”
— Katie Monoghan

Pitt gymnasts. “When Katie first
came, she was quiet and kept to
herself, and you could see it in
her routine,” Spector said. “She
has adjusted very well to compet-
ing on the college level.” Spector
said that the injury has not hurt
Monoghan‘s intensity: “She has
a beautiful vault now. All that
pounding is tough on your legs;
even if you don't perform your
trick just right, you still have to
land. She’s doing really well —
she’s tough, and she pulled
through nicely.”

Spector said that she doesn’t
feel any differently going into
this meet than she did before last
year’s. "Any big meet’s a big
meet, but I try to concentrate on
doing well in every meet. I think
we’re doing amazingly well, con-
sidering the number of freshmen
on the team. They've deﬁnitely
contributed to the team — we
couldn't compete without them."

scored their only run as a result of an
error. They were lucky to even get
that one run because they were held

I to a mere three hits, one each by
Britt Burns, Dan Spillner and Al
Jones.

Despite all this, the Pirates still
had a chance to win the game, or at
least send it into extra innings. With
the game tied in the bottom of the
ninth and the score tied at one, the
White Sox proceeded to hand the
Pirates yet another humiliating
defeat. Catcher Mark Hill, who is
not exactly a world-class speedster,
scored on a suicide squeeze play.

The main problem with the
Pirates has been the offense, or the
lack thereof. The Pirates carried a
.2l4 team batting average into Sun-
day’s game.

Jason Thompson hasn’t exactly
helped that average by hitting a

vmeager .143 so far this spring.
Catcher Tony Pena is struggling too,
with a .133 batting average. George
Hendrick, acquired to bolster Pirate
run production, has gone one for 17,
with that one hit being a bad-hop
single.

Another player who is expected to
contribute to the offense is Steve
Kemp. But recovering from rotator-
cuff surgery has held Kemp hitless.

Injuries are another problem that ,

the Bucs have had to deal with this
spring. Johnny Ray and Marvell
Wynne have been hampered by nag-
ging injuries, and Bill Madlock is
recovering from elbow surgery.

Friday at Ft. Myers, the Pirates
lost one of their top power-hitting
prospects in an unfortunate outfield
collision. Outﬁelder Bobby Bonilla,
who stands 6-3 and weighs 210 lbs.,
suffered a broken ankle and liga-
ment damage when he collided with
second baseman Bip Roberts, who
stands 5-6 and weighs 150 lbs. The
22-year-old switch hitter returned to
Pittsburgh and will probably require
surgery.

The Pirates are now talking trades
with the Phillies, who are in need of
pitching help.

The Silver Lining Award goes to
Jose DeLeon for his five innings of
shutout baseball -in his last
appearance.

Heon, Hickman big winners at nationals

 

March 25, 1985

By Mary Daigle
The Pitt News

The Lady Panther swimming team topped off its
most successful season since 1976 by bringing home
two more All-Americas after competing at the NCAA
championship this past weekend at the University of
Alabama. —

Sue Heon, who placed fourth in the 400-meter Indi-
vidual Medley at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los
Angeles, took twelfth place and earned All—America
status in the 400-yard 1M. Heon was also entered in
the 500-yard freestyle and the 1,650-yard freestyle
events, which were swam on the final night of compe-
tition. Results for those two races will be available late
Monday.

Heon was named the Women's Most Outstanding
Swimmer after winning the 500-yard freestyle, the
1,650-yard freestyle, the 400—yard 1M and 200-yard
backstroke at this year’s Big East championship.

By placing in the Top 16 in her event, Heon has now
earned the title of All—America for the fourth time.
Joining her in that feat are only three other Lady
Panther swimmers. Included in that elite group are
Kathy Stetler, who earned the title from 1976-79;
Suzanne Pulley (1978-81); Amy Jackson (1979-82);
and Heon (1981-83 and 1985).

Sophomore Susan Hickman is at the half-way point
of being a four-year All-America: She scored in the
50-yard freestyle for the second consecutive year. The
unofficial results have Hickman placing seventh in
that event.

According to Belowich, the team had high expecta-
tions for Hickman, who has been ranked as high as
second in the country in the 50-yard freestyle.

Hickman, a native of Orlando, Fla., was also a
member of the 200-yard freestyle relay team, along
with freshman Cindy Rose of Monroeville, sopho-
more Tracey Pfister of Bethel Park and junior Alicia
Dugan from Pittsford, N.Y., in the relay. The team
would have to place in the Top 16 in order to obtain
All-America status.

Following the Lady Panthers’ undefeated (9-0) sea-
son and consecutive Big East title, Belowich said that
the team would have a difficult time accomplishing
the third part of their goal for this season —— that is,
placing in the Top 10 at nationals. According to Belo-
wich, the team did not have enough people qualify for
nationals to compete for a Top 10 spot. “You only feel
disappointment for awhile,” he said. “In the long run,
you just remember the good swimming.”

Sources report Saurer to resign

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

Several sources close to the
Pitt athletic department have
indicated that Judy Saurer will
step down as head coach of the
Pitt women’s basketball team.
Reports indicate that Saurer will
meet with athletic department
officials today to discuss the past
season, at which time Saurer is
expected to resign. Saurer, who

completed her 22nd year of
coaching this past season, was
unavailable for comment at her
home in Erie, Pa., yesterday.

Speculation concerning Saur-
er’s future began Friday when
WPTS—F M reported that Saurer
would resign.

Saurer came to Pitt in 1980
from Edinboro University,
where she coached for 14 sea-
sons. While at Pitt, Saurer com-

piled an 85-57 record, including ‘

her 1980-81 team which finished
at 22-8 and came in ﬁfth in the
women’s NIT. This past season’s

team posted a 16-12 record, los-
ing in the first round of the Big

East Championships to Syracuse ‘

University.

Saurer’s career record of 258-
130 rank her among the elite of
women’s collegiate coaches. Her
success as a head coach got her
named to the Naismith Memor-
ial Basketball Hall of Fame in
1983 as one of the winningest
active collegiate coaches in the
country.

Possible replacements for
Saurer could be Kirk Bruce,
Saurer’s assistant this past sea-

son, or former Pitt coach Jean
Balthaser, who recently resigned
as head coach at Connecticut.
Bruce, team captain of the
1974 Pitt men’s team which fin-
ished at 18-11, was hired last year
after a successful stint as head
coach of Clairton High School.
At Clairton, Bruce compiled an
impressive 122-55 record, and
four of his seven teams made
state tournament appearances.
I Balthaser was head coach at
Pitt from 1977-80, and compiled
a 47-42 record before departing

for Connecticut 7Dve Hooker/ The Pitt es
