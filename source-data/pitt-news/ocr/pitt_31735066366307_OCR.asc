S U Summer Program

Begins With Jazz, Tea

Jazz is corningto the University campus tomorrow in a
unique program being sponsored by the Student Union. From
3 to 5 p.m. the Nu Tjazz trio will perform in the SU Lounge
where iced tea will be served to compliment the program.

The afternoon’s entertainment is the result of the com-
bined efforts of the Jazz Committee and the Iced Tea Hour
Committee. It will be the ﬁrst in’

a‘ series of social functions plan-
ned by the SU Committee, and is

free to members of the University.‘

The Nu Tjazz trio is composed
of three professional musicians
who specialize in modern jazz:
Chuck Spatafore, drums; Eddie
Russ, piano; and Bob Boswell,
bass. They have formerly per-
formed on the local scene at
such establishments as Craw-
ford’s and the Mardi Gras.

The jazz concert is currently
scheduled for the SU Lounge, but
weather permitting, it will be giv-
en outside on the patio facing
Bigelow Blvd.

Gary Levinson, chairman of the
Jazz Committee, has been hand-
ling this ﬁrst in a series of SU
summer entertainments. He stated
that the success of the series
would depend greatly on the
turnout at this performance, since
attendance is the only indication
of student demand for such a pro-
gram.

Ideas for other offerings dur-
ing the summer, if attendance
warrants such programs, include
Friday night dances in the Hunt
Room or Pine Room, folk sing-
ing, and patio parties. Free iced
tea would be served at all these
functions.

Levinson emphasized that to-
morrow’s jazz concert would be
informal. He hopes it will afford
an opportunity for dorm residents

to get together and become ac-
quainted. A s =

McHale Names

a Player Cast For

‘Everyman’

Michael McHale, director of Pitt

H‘, Players, has named the cast for

“Everyman,” the medieval alle-
gory to be produced June 8 and

10. This is Pitt Players’ ﬁnal pro-
duction for the school year.

All the roles are of approxi-
mately equal length, and no one
can be billed in a lead part.
Characters are: discretion, Linda

sin, Ruth Katz; good deeds, Pat
Lennox; knowledge, Rosalie Stew-
art; confession, Susan Valentine.

The male students in the cast
are: doctor, Nick‘Belich; messen-
ger, Peter Hoover; in addition to
Ed Ritchie, Tony Lufrano, and
George Mazzi./

William Stanley is the cos-
tume and set designer with Pat
Lennox serving as his assistant.
Don Gastoff, an alumnus, will
handle the duties of stage man-
ager and technical director.

Two productions are slated, one
at the Pittsburgh Art Festival in
the Gateway Center Plaza on June
8 starting -around 8 p.m. The.
other will be held on the evening
of Commencement Exercises, on
the Cathedral lawn between 7:30
and 8 p.m.

The reason for the unsettled
times when the play should start
is planned. McHale hopes to have
the play end at dusk, because the
natural lighting -emphasizes the

moral of the play and makes a
more effective setting.

Professors ‘ Get

Offensive Mail

University officials have asked
the downtown Pittsburgh post
office for their cooperation in
locating the source of a number
of anti-catholic and anti-semitie
letters

They took this action when fac-
ulty members complained about
the. Pamphlets and other items
which they had received both
through the campus mail and
through the United States mail.

The letter which was sent by
the University to the downtown
post office said that “the tone of
the material is somewhat ominous
and that it has caused anxiety to
the families of some recipients
wh recall the recent murder of
a U iversity of California grad-
uate student by a religious fana-
tic whose professed target was a
professor.”

University post office employ-
ees have made an extensive effort
to locate the source of the in-
ternal mailings but without suc-
cess, according to Captain
Charles Ray, head of the Uni-
versity police department.

The letter went on to say that
“whether a real or imagined
threat, these pamphlets are dis-
turbing to our faculty, and alien
and repugnant to an institution

I {Diploma A Dilemma

Commencement day terminates a student’s undergrad- A

uate career. , , .
Included in the convocation program on commence-

'ment day is a pompous academic procession, a distinguish-

ed guest’s'oration, the donning of hoods by several honor-
able citizens and scholars, and the presentation of 81/2"
by 11" paper diplomas to the majority of the participants.

Each of the events in the convocation is supposed to
demonstrate the perfection, elegance and harmony of de-

- tails characteristic of the classic idea of scholarship in an

academic community.
But paper diplomas add something of the new world’s
spirit to the medieval ceremony-—they are economical. In

the past, sheepskin diplomas, given in scroll form to the I

recipient of the bachelor degree, climpaxed the undergrad-
uate career. Each student’s name was written on the sheep-
skin by hand. But sheepskin diplomas are not like academic
robes; they cannot be used the following year by another
group; they are just academic souvenirs, worthless in an
economic sense to the University.

On June 10, when the undergraduate departs from
the University with his paper diploma, he will wonder if

he actually was a part of the ornate ceremony held on the A

campus green between the gothic Cathedral and Heinz
Chapel. '

It is a natural reaction that students should prefer to
return to traditional sheepskin iwhich symbolizes both a
bond with the University and a reward for undergraduate
scholarship.

Recently, Student Government sent a letter to Dr. John
Geise, assistant chancellor of student affairs, criticizing

_ the change made by the University last year which re-

sulted in the abominable paper certiﬁcate. Although this
transaction took place more than a month ago, ‘Student
Government has received no acknowledgement of the letter.
It is necessary that Student ‘Government continue this
attempt to bring back tradition since they are the only body
representing students that has legislative power. If Student
Governmentfails to assert its power, future graduates will
continue to participate in a ‘formal, classical ceremony as
outside intruders of the modern world of economy.

Policy or ‘Penalty . . .

 

Fading Honesty

By Julie Thomas

Honesty is the best policy has not only become
a cliche in the written and spoken sense, but in
America, from all appearances, it has also lost its
moral signiﬁcance. What Americans believe when
it.comes to honesty and its very_
close counterpart, integrity,
spells out the horrors of a plainly
dishonest society. .

Whose fault is it that such a
situation exists? The answer if
all we have been taught is true,
lies in (the educated. Yet, the
vice exists in all levels of intel-
ligence and education. While
preaching honesty on the one
hand, many educated and educa-
tors reach for the fast, the dis-
honest, buck with the other. The justiﬁcation, for
such an action most often, is practicality. A person
has to eat and apparently few men can survive on
a steady diet of honesty.

Examples Reoccur

, Read the papers. Examples proving such a topic
appear day after day in such profusion that the
number is becoming frightening. Corruption re-
cently has even outnumbered crime news. Across

, the /top of one paper a few weeks ago, six high-

ranking employees of electrical manufacturing com-
panies were accused of price ﬁxing. Out and out
attempts for shorter hours and better pay ran ram-

pant at the nation’s missilebase at Cape Canaveral.’

And college basketball players bowed to the bribes
of conniving gangsters. I
Yet, of all of these violations, not one carried
with it any serious penalty. Thirty days in jail for
the officials preceded their reinstatement as elec-
trical directors on the Board of — trustees. A few

pieces of bad publicity hit the pipeﬁtters involved.

at the base. And the basketball players, well -
the athletes suffered the greatest loss, or so it

Cops or Robbers . .».

 

would seem. A disgraceful dismissal from any uni_
versity seems so ﬁnal. But how many people re_
member those men involved in the 1951 basketbau,
scandal! More important, yet, how many people
know that one of. those boys accused and convicted
of accepting bribes at that time now teaches in the‘

New York school system after completing his edu,

cation at another university? Was the penalty
actually so great? Perhaps experience is the best

teacher, but how can that man convey to his stu..,

dents what so many people had failed to put across
to him? Here is the real problem. How can the few
honest men in this country ‘teach abstract ideals
when actual life proves exactly the opposite!
Cause Thru Inbreeding

The real fault for such a situation lies in a

system of inbreeding. Because their parents, be,

cause their predecessors lived a dishonest life and
got away with it, the upcoming generation feels it
should and can do the same. The fault is one that
is inbred in this society because ’few honest men

have the courage to stand up for what they be-.

lieve, and when they do they are scoffed at and
ridiculed. ‘
Take for example the man who found $240,000

_worth of unmarked bills and returned them. The

comments directed against his honesty made him
say, “I wish I had never found the money.”

All of these examples only show more explicitly
the uphill ﬁght of the university. The dishonesty
cycle must be broken. The process must be a slow
one —— one that requires the energies of all members
of a university. Those who teach must be able to
show that honesty really does pay. Perhaps this

university already has its start. In the case of Pitt

players, Dick Falenski and John‘Fried1y, the honest
way came out on top and saw the conviction of one
of the forces working against this society from
within. It can only be hoped that the example set
by these two boys will help minimize the over-
powering inﬂuences of the other ones.

The Police State  

. By Chuck Dunbar

I’ve heard it said that the world is full of good
people as well as bad. And over the past two years
I’ve been ﬁnding out how true this is — only the
reverse. Bad seems to have some sore of strangle-
hold on the good in the world.
Of course, I’ve been going to Pitt"
while this revelation has slowly
seeped into my life’s brief tenure,
so I guess the University does
have some ‘educational value
after all.

But I’m wasting my breath by
going off into philosophical tan-
gents when I should be directing
my attentions to ‘speciﬁc facts.
The particular area of experi-
ence which has enlightened me

 

on this good-bad category:concerns  group known

as the University Police. ;  ,5 3

For decades police have enjoyed g a reputation
for being rough, and the Universityhops are no ex-
ception. But then a law enforcement oﬂ“1cer’s job

justiﬁes the need for the roughness'l.”“A few mend-"
' bers of the Pitt force however, seem to be overdoing

it. Right at the start I want to "explain that some
of the University Police are what you could classify
as true friends, but. -there are the few “bad ones”
who give the group a black eye.
TR-esirainf Employed Y ' I

‘A Libel laws being what they are, it would be
somewhat illegal as well as unfair to mention
names, so we’ll have to settle for general com-
plaints. The Pitt News ofﬁce is a focus for student
opinion —- and complaints ’— and from this source
‘I can derive most of the examples. I5 have also had
a personal contact with the organization which
proved disappointing, but this can_be discounted;
Actually it takes ‘a personal experience to wake a
person up to what is going on around him in an
area with which he has had no previous dealings;

_ Common courtesy is unknown to some mem-
bers of the force. They think the badge of a police-
man affords them the right to tell people what to

do in no uncertain terms, and then expect a- cour-

teous reply. These delinquents could learn a lesson

from their friendlier counterparts, who receive con- ’

siderably more cooperation. But human nature dic-
tates that the unfriendly ones should exist to bal-
ance the friendly, which is‘ a nice way of saying
.“.>§.*R'°h ' iati n,.iS i¢0I17¢¢tab1€> ‘Still weecan

 

The second item on the complaint list registers
the largest backing, but it is relatively minor.
Parking tickets have always been anathema to Pitt
students, and the indiscriminate and wholesale
tagging of cars by the University Police has been
no help. One student outﬁtted with a perfectly
legitimate temporary parking permit was informed
the permit was void, and told to move.

A careful check with higher authorities proved
the permit valid, but this samestudent recently re-
cently received a ticket on the very same permit.

A ticket is only a little thing, but the inconvenience,

is enormous. Why?

Parking ﬁnes aren’t settled in the police office,
the most likely place. Rather, a justice of the peace
in Wilkinsburg collects the ﬁne. Not only is it in-
convenient to travel to Wilkinsburg, but it is twice
as hard to ﬁnd the office. 0
Security Lagging’

This whole complaint builds to a crescendo,
when it comes time “to talk about security. Stolen
clothes from the dormitories and $60,000 worth -of
painting gone don’t leave me with any sense of
security. These thefts would probably occur even
with the strictest police protection, but the investi-
gation of the crimes undermines any faith in. the
University police corps.

  Broken Jaw Puts Matulevic

2‘

Out For Season, Pitney Fills In

By JIJVI O’BRIEN

The Panther nine has two engagements this week minus
their Captain Jerry Matulevic, who is out for the season with
a cracked jaw, according to Coach Bobby Lewis. The Cats
play Slippery Rock away today, and the Rockets are favor-

- ed to duplicate their 8-2 early season win again.

‘Netmen Play

The last time they met, Panther hurler, Ralph Shut-

Franklin & Marshall will pro-

vide the opposition for the Pan-
ther netmen today at the Taylor
Allderdice Courts. The match is a
reschedule of an earlier match be-
tween the two teams that had

' to be cancelled.

Even though the Cats were

soundly beaten by F&M last year,

».. 7-2, Coach Bill Summers is con-

A

ﬁdent of a victory. “I think we
can take them, but it will be
close,’’ he predicts. '

Summers will s tic k with the

same six players that he has used
all year in singles play. However,
changes will be necessary in the
doubles.

Working commitments have
forced Ted Martens to tempor-
arily drop from the team. Soph-
omore Pete Nycum will take
Martens’ place in teaming with

.,Paul Kochman. Nycum has ap-

peared onc' before this season,

losing in doubles play with Dave

0’Loughlin at Carnegie Tech.
The other doubles teams will be

the once beaten pair of Jack
Douglass and Joe Brown and
0’Loughlin and Ralph Mason.

Douglass posted two more vic-

tories last week to boost his un-
blemished mark to 9-0. His back
injury and classes have prevent-
ed him from moving up from his
number three position.

If the opportunity arises for

,3‘ Douglass to challenge O’Lough1in

opinion of Summers, “a good bet
to win.” For the time being, “Jack

Pitt returns to Forbes Field on

at 2 o’clock. Again the Cats will
rate the under—dog role as their
opponents have played twice as
many games so far, including a
tour of the Southern states during

the Easter Vacation.

Lewis plans to exploit the
pitching talents of Lauren Guth-

and Bill Shay this week. Fire-

In the second game of the
double-header with Penn State,
Matulevic collided with ﬁrst-
baseman Pete Suder behind the
pitcher’s mound, ﬁelding a soft
pop ﬂy. “They both dove for
the ball,” Lewis explained, “and
apparently, Suder’s knee struck
him in the face.”

Matulevic underwent surgery on
Monday. The doctors planned to
bring his jaw out from inside be-
cause it is depressed inward. The
injury was inflicted right beneath

his left eye.

pionships and the cost will be
small,” Rees said. “We can’t af-
ford to do that, so we must take
only the athletes who can place.”

 

“The American

people," said the

late Al Smith, “never
carry an umbrella.
They prepare to walk"
in eternal sunshine.”

America is good to
the man who puts his
faith in fair weather.
But don't leave
everything to the
weather man.

We can help, too.

Because African mail service is
slow, Dr. Kline hadn’t heard from
her until his phone rang several
nights ago. The call was from
Bolahun, Liberia via Vienna, Vir-
ginia. A ham operator in Virginia
had been talking to a missionary
in Africa who asked him if he
would relay a message to Dr.
Kline. Kline talked to the mis-
sionary and was assured that his
wife was in good health and ex-
pected to arrive in Pittsburgh this
week-end.

The two operators who relayed
Mrs. Kline’s message are part of a
world-wide network of hams, a
network in which the University
is represented. The representa-
tive’s name is the University of
Pittsburgh Radio Association. '

Using a member’s transmitter
and the antennas over Schenley
Hall, they have already spoken to
hams in Hawaii, Europe, and
Latin America.

During the fall trimester, when
the organization hopes to have
the necessary equipment, it will
serve the University asa civil de-
fense unit, message relay station,
and possibly a speedy communi-
cation center for other campus
activities.

ganization makes it possible for
the University to request the type
of aid that would be needed by
the University and the City of
Pittsburgh during a civil emerg-
ency.

As a message relay station, the
University ham station will be
able to relay messages between
out-of-town students and their
homes. “Nets” of the American

Radio Relay League enable ‘hams
to send most messages to any

place on the continent and some-.

times around the world within a
few minutes. Students who come
to the station when their town
is contacted will probably be able
to speak directly to their fam-
ilies.
