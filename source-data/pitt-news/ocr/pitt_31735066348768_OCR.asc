 The University is searching its

Bdoks for what may amount to
$156,000, misplaced by an ac-
counting error, in operating funds
from the Student Activities area.

Auditors hit upon the fundsdin an
investigation ~ sparked‘ by Alloca-

Joyce on the question of setting
.aside the Student Activities funds
in an interest-generating account.

Tuition hike snag

BY GENE GRABOWSKI
Pitt hasn’t submitted its pro-
jected tuition ﬁgures for the

coming‘ ﬁscal year to the Pennsyl-_

vania Higher Education Assistance
Agency (PHEAA), despite the state
organization’s request that ' it
receive the data immediately.

The projections, speciﬁcally
those of thetentative tuition costs
for next year, are necessary for
PHEAA to calculate the total _aid
package to which individual Pitt
students are entitled.

‘case.

The exact ﬁgure of the sum has
not been determined yet, but

University auditors and Student .
Activities ofﬁcials are expected to '

_begin a careful review of the books,
according to Joyce.

The money has been gathering in
the j, “agency accounts” in the
University accounting mechanism
for about seven years, according to
Vice-Chancellor for. Student Affairs
Alfred Moye.

“It’s a matter ‘of pretty poor
monitoring,” Moye said. “I’ve
asked for an exact accounting of the
amount and the account number.”

The problem facing University
auditors resulted from a mixing of
money slated for student organiza-
tions and the Student Activities

The money was never
returned to the general account.

Under normal, circumstances, the
surplus then would be "sent out
from the general account at the

beginning of the next ﬁscal year, as

part of the Student Government.

The deadline for student appli-
cation for financial help was May 1.

According to PHEAA repre-
sentative Ron Taylor, the Univer-
sity delay will create only minor
problems for the agency.

“We’ll.just hold off processing
Pitt students’ applications until
-their total tuition ﬁgures are in,”
Taylor said. “There’s no major
problem unless Pitt submits the
data after July.”

Favor Mazzei’s Removal

BY BRIAN DUNN

Seventy percent of Pitt students
who know who Frank Mazzei is
think he should . be removed
immediately from his State Senate
seat even though his appeal is still
pending, according ‘to a Pitt News

@4311 conducted Tuesday.

   
 

However, another 30% of.all

students questioned either said_

they did not know who Mazzei is or
could not identify him properly.

not acted. The Board of Trustees
also has remained silent on the

Anti-racist forces in Pittsburgh
called for massive support for the
May 17 Boston march against
segregation in public schools,
during a news conference held
Tuesday intthe Student Union.

The march, an ofﬁcial project of
the National Board of Directors of
the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP), is a move to mobilize
national response to attacks on
Boston desegregation efforts.

Proposed as a peaceful and legal
action, the march will not result in

a confrontation with anti-busing .

groups, according to Pittsburgh
Students Against Racism Coalition
(SCAR) members. The marchers
have obtained a legal permit to
march from Fens Stadium to the
Boston Commons. .

A member of the South Boston
ROAR (Restore Our
Rights)‘, an anti-busing group,
explained, “There will be no
confrontation unless they try to
come into South Boston. We do not
allow that here.”

Explaining there has never been

racism in ‘Boston,’ just ‘anti-busing

sentiment, a ROAR member said,
“They .. say - they’re marching
against racism--they’re just Com-
munists.” _

Mark Satinoff, the chairman of
the press conference and a
Pittsburgh SCAR’ member, urged

"Pittsburgh support of the march, ‘

saying “A victory or defeat for
black equality will have an impact
on black students in Pittsburgh.

Vice-Chancellor for Budget and

added that his staff hasn’t yet been
able to come up with anaccurate
forecast for next year. Thus

_PHEAA and the students must,

wait.

“Already, a
brewing over Reizenstein school
and the slownessof the Board (‘of
Education to implement ‘ school
desegregation.” ’

Reizenstein ‘school, scheduled to
open in the fall, has been touted by
the Pittsburgh Board of Education
as a model for quality school
desegregation in the Homewood_-

Brushton area. There will be open
enrollment for white students, and
black students will be selected by
computer. Westinghouse and

Baxter schools, located in "Home-

wood-Brushton area, will be
maintained temporarily as all-black
facilities.

Opponents of the plan claim the
open enrollment plan will not work
and that the Board of Education
has been too slow in implemen-

tation of desegregation in Pitts-

burgh.‘- .

Boston NAACP President Thom-
as Atkins has said similar -plans
have not worked in Boston.

The Boston march, marking the
anniversary of the historic 1954
Brown vs Board of Education
Supreme Court decision declaring
“separate but equal” schools
inherently unequal, calls for the
continuation of desegregation in
Boston schools and for similar
desegregation efforts in other
northern cities. '

Pitt needed a more complete

“We have to wait for the

the fall. But the political backlash
from Harrisburg and the outcry
from non-recipient students pro-
hibited such an expedient measure,
he said.

According to Taylor, Pitt stu-
dents will not be hurt by the
University’s tardiness in submit-
ting the tuition ﬁgures.

“Although we’ll have to hold off
on processing their applications,”
he said, “PHEAA has enough

money to cover all their needs--at.

least for the fall--even if they are
processed last."~- _ .
Taylor said he couldn’t say

 A Univ. Late with PHEAA Data

whether the state would have
enough money to fund students of
any school adequately after the fall
term, since PHEAA's budget is
still incomplete.

Other state-related universities
reportedly are late in their PHEAA
budget submissions. Penn State,
Pennsylvania and Temple have yet
to give definite ﬁgures, 4_ mainly
because of deliberation over
internal program cutbacks, accord-
ing to Taylor. “All the state-re-
lated schools are having a tough
time making ends meet this year,”
he noted. '

kind exist in the United States.

' Our thanks and congratulations go to Dr. Richard Mennen, a Pitt

I festival is poles apart from its metropolitan playhouse counterparts in
’ regard to commercialism. ' p
'. The festival no doubt has rejuvenated many Pitt students’ feelings
toward theatre and the arts in general. Mennen must be credited for
e n his incisive perception in taking a risk on the new project and for
' working thankless hours to make it an outstanding success.
Pittsburgh has always been a theatrical desert, with no subscribers
‘ or even casual observers from the middle and lower classes. Only
 ‘ recently have popular festivals sprtmg up to immerse the average
I Pittsburgher in theatre. ’ The 99 Cent Floating Theatre Festival stands
,, taH among these festivals, and its strategic role at a university that
strongly reflects its surroundings cannot be underestimated.
s Mennen, therefore, hopes to continue the program next year, as long
 as the University provides the proper funds.

The Dem M

BY VLADIMIR W. HAN CZAR

The day all the politicians have
been eagerly awaiting is approach-V
ing rapidly. May 20, Primary
Election Day, the day the people
get to choose the candidates they
wish tosee run for election under
their’ respective political party
labels.

The people are choosing their
representatives, whose’ concerns
are the “of, by and for” the
political parties have utmost in

their minds when battling for the_

privilege to represent you in your
government. _
In Pennsylvania,_ the people
eligible to vote in the primary are
restricted to those electors who
register to vote under a political
party label. (No independents,
please.) To assist the voter in
choosing the “best” candidates
possible, each political. party has
elected representatives who per-
iodically endorse candidates to run
for office under the party label.
In Allegheny County, there are
approximately '1,300 election dis-
tricts or precincts. Each party, in
each district, has the right to‘elect a
man and a woman to present its
views and represent the precinct in
party matters. These 2,600 people
are the County Committee people.
The Committee people--the door-
bell-ringing, pamphlet-pushing,
slate card-carrying, , car pool-run-

, ning operators of democracy ; are

the people who influence’ which
candidates win the election. If you
belong to a political party, they are
your representatives. They are

‘elected. They seldom encounter

opposition, because few people
aspire to performing the menial
chores of politics. These is no pay
as such, but more than a few of
these Committee people hold‘

. How  take those lumps

Getting   Rid;

BY PETE BUTCH
‘/Remember last year’s coal
miners’ strike? How companies
stockpiled‘ coal ‘and how by the
strike’s end the price of coal had
skyrocketed from $20 to $60 per
ton? ‘

You also may have noticed that
once coal reached this high price
the national coal lobby shifted into
overdrive; reminding us how
plentiful coal was, and how it
wasn’t buried under tons of sand in
Arabia, and how it was the fuel of
the future. The lobby even
advocated making some of our
Rocky Mountain States into‘ gigan-
tic craters, ‘just to get the coal
underneath.

I have nothing against strip
mines. Fewer miners get hurt,
since strip mines don’t cave in as
often.) _ ‘

But now the lobby’s voice has
quieted. _ Perhaps- it is mere
coincidence, but it could have
something to do with the plummet
of coal prices to , $25-$30 per
ton--because of stockpiling.

It seems a waste to have all this
coal lying around, so methods have
been devised to put it to good use.

lumps of coal added to the gas tank

political jobs. -
The public refers to them as

' “political hacks” or “the ma-

chine.” They prefer to call
themselves “the party” or “the
organization.” '

' On March 8, long before regular
citizens were thinking about
politics, let alone about primary
elections, the Allegheny County
Democratic Committee met at the
Syria Mosque to make its endorse-
ments. I was there because I was
elected to the County Committee
by defeating an incumbent, who
was a county employee. '

My hometown delegation of
Carnegie typifies the impact
patronage has on the committee
representation. It is comprised of
18 members, 12 of which hold
political jobs. Seven of these jobs
are in county government. Our
chairman works at the airport.‘ Our
vice-chairman works in the Protho-
notary’s Office.

We met at the Mosque to make
endorsements.- The tension that

‘filled the air was from desperation.

The members of the machine
believe their jobs are at stake.

They will protect their jobs. They

will endorse the incumbents. Their
anxiety is partially relieved with
small talk and joking. The main
event features the incumbent
county commissioners, Leonard
Staisey and Thomas Foerster, and
the challenger, Sheriff Eugene
Coon. Coon speaks, his workers
scream. The, incumbents speak;

« their workers roar, yell and scream. ~

The incumbents surely would win
a contest on the applause-o-meter.
The other serious candidates,
James Flaherty and Alex Jaffurs,.
are not presented. This is not a
college ‘debate geared for rational
discussion’. It is an endorsement

"meeting--by the machine, for the

machine. V

could extend gasoline mileage
300%. Researchers cautiously
point out that tests were conducted
on 1917 Stanley .Steamers. They
hypothesize that use in other cars
could cause severe engine knock-
sing, along with reduced fuel filter’
life. ‘ '

_MOLOTOV COCKTAIL: This
use was reported by striking
mineworkers who lit lumps of coal

_and threw them at management

automobiles. They found that
although the coal usually doesn’t
stay lit, and doesn’t explode on
impact, it makes considerable
dents on automobile fen_ders and
Windshields--and on management.
JEWELRY: You’ve seen those
funny-looking dwarf carrots and
corn cobs in the gourmet food
stores. Well, wear a lump of coal
on a string around your neck and
tell friends you’re wearing a
‘ ‘dwarf diamond.” , Remember,
diamonds are only coal that did
well under pressure. -
FOOD: Coal is mostly carbon

— with some hydrogen thrown in--the
basic constitutuent of carbohy-

drates. This makes coal a natural
organic nutrient. Following is
French Chef Ken Pearce’s recipe
for Stoned Crow Pie a la mode.

The speakers drone on. The
County Controller is unopposed.
The incumbent District Attorney is
against rape. His opponent is not
fo rape, or for any of the
incumbents. Also, the County

Treasurer and the Register of Wills};/I-\

are unopposed. Next comes the
Prothonotary, then the Recorder of
Deeds. The Committee people
have quit listening long ago. “The
Party!” “Roosevelt!” Ten candi-
dates speak, each seeking to be
Clerk of Courts. “I think it’s a.
disgrace that Republicans hold any
office.” Frank Mazzei strides from
behind the scenes and is greeted,
warmly by our chairman. “Let us
unite. . .as Republican ﬁghters.
only Democrats can beat Demo-
crats.” The candidates attempt to
cheerlead, but the audience has
lost its ' enthusiasm and its
patience. It knows how to vote.

Fifteen judicial candidates drone
on,but seldom go beyond reciting

quite candidly reveals that “poli-

tics isn’t dirty, it’s the American

‘way.” . _

The candidates have had their

say. . -

I’ve heard from .a football
referee, a past Grand Exalted Ruler
Elks, several former
Democratic Chairmen, and a
lawyer with 12 kids. I’ve listened
to more solicitors in one afternoon
than Xaviera Hollander will hear
from in her entire lifetime.

We, the people of the Demo-’
cratic Committee, have decided.
We are ready to vote.

.I decide to vote against the
incumbents. My - candidates’
names do not appear on the
machine. The write-in doors are
locked shut.

The machine has decided to
endorse the incumbents.

Letter to the editor‘

The Boycott VVorl<s

To the editor:

I would like to take issue with
several points in Paul Mazur’s
analysis of the UFW-Gallo dispute.
In general, the article is accurate
and captures the essence of the
major issue involved in the Gallo
boycott. However, I do object to
the comment that the UFW is

senting the farmworkers as slaves
victimized by corporate exploita-
tion.

It is very important to see the
Gallo conﬂict in the larger context
of the struggle for unionization

.among the farmworkers, and the

farm labor question as a whole.

The Gallo winery is not the only
company which has refused to
renew its contract with-the UFW.

Nearly all the table grape and most
of the wine grape producers signed
contracts with the Teamsters with-
out any elections to determine if

their woirkers in fact desired a
change in union affiliation. Al-
though they claim, like Gallo, to
have petitions or authorization
cards signed by their workers, none
have submitted written proof to a
disinterested third party for veriﬁ-
cation. The lettuce growers, who

were non-unionized prior to 1970,
were a little more blatant about

signing sweetheart contracts with’
the Teamsters; they H never even
claimed to have any kind of proof
indicating the preference of their
workers.

It is evident that the Gallo dispute
is not an isolated incident, but just ’
one aspect of a larger effort on the
part of corporate growers to thwart
the United Farmworkers Union and
all it represents. One should note
that most of the growers are not
“small,” family concerns like Gal-
lo, but are owned by corporations
like Dow Chemical and Tennecp.
One must remember as well that
only a small percentage of farm-

 

 

 -‘May:

workers. are covered ‘any "con-'

tract at all, and that only 10% of
those supposedly covered by
teamster‘ contract receive the full
protection, because of the labor.
contractingsystem that the Team-
ster contracts permit- The corpor-
ate exploitation of farmworkers is
not the ﬁgment of some romantic’s
dream, but a very hard reality.
Finally, the existence of a contract
between Gallo and the Teamsters is
not an impediment to a just
solution of the conﬂict through
secret-ballot elections. Three other
companies--DeGeorgio, Perelli-

_Minetti and» Interharvest--had _

idated and those companies are
now under UFW contract. The.
objective of the boycott (which, by *
the way, is working--Gallo’s na-
tional sales have fallon almost:
19%) is precisely to insure that the »
workers involved do not have to
wait another two years before_ they _
are accorded what is theirs--their
right to join the union of their
choice,

receiver,‘ Pete] Demmerle, and
three year letterman at guard
Gerry DiNarde.

Capable halfbacks Al Samuel,
Eric Pennick_ and Ron Goodman
also will not be around to win one
for the Gipper. '

The frontrunner for quarterback
at the present is Frank Allocco,

_ who gets an extra year of eligibility

because he sat out his sophomore -
season due to anarm injury. He
has some experience playing be-
hind Clements for two seasons,
putting him well ahead of the other
candidates--seniors Rick Slager
and Kurt Horton and sophomores
Joe Montana, Gary Forystek, Mike
Falash and Ted Burgmeier.

The backﬁeld isn’t exactly crying
for talent with Art Best, Mark
McLane, Terry Eurick and Jim
Weiler at halfbackand Tom Parise
and Russ Kormman at the fullback
slot. " -

Devine will have his biggest
problems in the offensive line,
where little experience is available
and depth is nowhere tobe found.

. Offensive captain-elect Ed Bauer
is the only veteran in the interior
line, with more than 60 minutes
playing time from last year while
ﬁlling in for the injured Steve ,
Neece. Tackle Steve Sylvester and
center Mark Brenneman also will
be missed. Elton Moore and Cal

,Ball'iet are ,expected to battle for

the guard position with Vince Klees
expected to take over for Brenne-
man. Sophomore Harry Weebken-
berg could bethe man at ‘a tackle
position even though he appeared
in only three games brieﬂy in ’74.

Tight end may be a problem for- .

Notre Dame with Ken MacAfee the
only man up for the job.‘ At 6-5 and

245 pounds “Big Mac” is certainly V‘

a good target as he finished last
season with.146 yards in recep-
tions. ‘  "

Pete Demmerle was Clement’s

bread and butter man, the ‘one he .

would call on in tough "passing
situations. Candidates for his job
will be seniors Kevin Doherty, Dan
Kelleher and Bob Walls.

Defensively the Irish weren’t
bothered as much by graduation as
their offensive counterparts, but

.. things aren’t all that rosy.

V All-Americans at tackle Mike
Fanning and Kevin Nosbush have
moved on in the world, leaving a
hole big enough for the proverbial
Mack truck to come through.

Senior co-captains Jim Stock and

makelthe‘ score 4-2 going into the
doubles. He outlasted Frank Toth
with a pressure third-set tiebreaker

victory. Joe Kantor at number one_ '

and Harry Habbel at five both lost
heartbreakers to their opponents.
In the doubles competition, the
depth of the California squad
surprised the cocky Panthers, and
both the number one and number
three doubles teams fell in straight
‘sets. This set the stage for

Dieffenbach and Habbelto decide *2

the match with their aggressive
“serve and volley”, games.

  Piﬂllosls Fifth  

L Annual Track
2  Invitational

BY RICK STOUFFER
Sports Editor

Every year it seems the Pitt
Invitational track meet gets bigger
But it also gets better

More than-44 colleges from the
eastern United States will make

their way. to Pitt Stadium this

Friday and Saturday for the fifth
annuallrunning of the event. a-

With the help of a nice day, this
couldbe one of the fastest meets of
the outdoor season. The Tartan
surface of Panther Stadium is a
boon to runners no matter what the
distance; If the wind is calm every
record in the book could be broken,‘

-topping last year’s'"meet, .which

shattiered all but three. _

When it is stated that more than ’

44 schools will attend. it doesn’t
mean run-of-the-mill track people.
For example Villanova, long an

eastern track power, is bringing its .

entire squad. This includes their
distance medley relay team, which

set a world record only a week ago
at the Penn Relays in Philadelphia. 2

The Terrapins of Maryland,
always a strong field event team,
will bring three long jumpers who
have leaped over 25 feet.

Penn State will bring the indoor
champion in the quarter mile to Pitt

.Mike

in the person of Mike Sands. He
will also be running in the 100 and '

220 yard dashes.

Seton Hall of New Jersey will
bring what is probably thefastest V
team in the sprints- to the
invitational. .Combine this sprint
speed into a relay team and it’s
easy to see why this little" school
can run with the biggest in the

country."  f

j »..4:

Pitt Head Track Coach ,Jim ,
Banner is not without _a talented"
arsenal. Freshman sensation Mike
Matter’ will be heaving the javelin
at theStadium. Assistant coach
Agostinella, himself - an
ex-javelin tosser, has called Matter
one of the top three throwers in the
country.«. Keep in mind the boy is v
only a frosh. _ -

Miler Nick Martin, who missed
the entire indoor season because Of/—-&r..;.

x.»

serious leg injury,is back in shape,  ’
which means he is a force to ‘be '
reckoned with in the mile run.

And then there is the “old man”
of the team--Chuck Mozingo.
“Moze,” ninth in the country
during the indoor season, is back
for one more time in the outdoor
half mile. It’s safe to say'he will be
amdng the top ﬁnishers‘.

The meet isopen to the public J
and all are urged to “attend the
two-day affair beginning Friday

_ afternoon.
