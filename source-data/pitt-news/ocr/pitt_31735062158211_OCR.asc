Party System
Comes To Pitt .
Early In 1955  

By MANNY SILVERBLATT

Political parties at Pitt may’! '

be established within the next
few ‘ months. Men’s Council
held their most important
meeting of the year last Wed-

nesday night to develop plans

for a two party system.
Despite objections from the

Dean of Men’s oﬁice, council‘,

members, lead by president
Robert Wilkins, voted unani-

-mously to adopt the new pro-

gram; They believed that it would
remedy the confusion of past
elections and student
spirit. ’

increase

Jack Hardman, assistant to the E

Dean of Men, felt that adminis-
tration was not in a position to
express itself one way or the
other.
officials are critcal and skeptical
toward the program because of
failures of political parties in the
past to accomplish set goals.
Solons,. who at the beginning‘
of the meeting offered opposi-

tion, said that free candidacy of-_ V, r

fered a better chance for more
people to participate. They con-
tended that parties would offer
a monopoly, and that one part
might become too strong year
after year and chase away good
candidates who vmight not be
affiliated with any of them.

After discussion, all members

agreed that all studeﬂs would’

beneﬁt if a good system were

worked out. Those in‘ favor es-

tablished that parties would en-

courage more student participa-,
tion in school affairsas well as

interest throughout the year.

Students will sign upfor parties g

each year, and an expiration time
will be set in which‘ the student
is free to join or change his choice.
Membership lists will be kept in
the Dean of Men’s office. Solons
discussed the possibility of a reg-
istration week.‘ 0

Candidates will be able to run
‘for one party. Election costs _will.

probably be limited to no more ’

than $150 to $175. The program,
at present, includes only male
students and offices in Men’s
Council, Student Congress, and
individual classes. ‘

Tonight and Saturday Mark

  Big Doorstep Big Hit

By IRV ROTHMAN
‘ . Pitt Players have combined an unusual story, strong
southern dialogue and a welcome change in scenery to score
another hit. in its second show of the current se.ason, “The

Great Big Doorstep.”

Students and guests from other universities would do
well to round out a weekend of debate and basketball by
visiting Stephen Foster Memorial auditorium either tonight

‘or tomorrow.

But take seats by 8:30 p.m. in order not to miss the ﬁrst

troduce and conclude

-of American folk ballads sung by Billy Herman which in-
each act.

Besides showing a rare

"ability to put across folk tunes he

sets the pacefor a story of com-
mon men and women- in the Lou-
is" ha Bayous, and starts the show
out on a high plane.

Bob Rosborough, in the lead role

‘of the Commodore, exploits the,

character of the bombastic but
shiftless head of the Crochet fam-
ily convincing manner. By the

. time the show is,’ over, the crafts-

man has wielded his part so that
the audience might like to go into
partnership in his “drainage”
business. When he tells about
plans for “new screens and lilies
out in‘the open in‘ their new
house,” he completely wraps on-
lockers, in an emotional speech
bring lumps into
throats along with hearty laughs.

 Crochet, played by Jane
Womelsdorf, matches her mate in
every respect as the long suffering
mother of a starving ill-housed
brood. Her fears that the “Fam-
ily’s ibust’n up” will gain pity just
as the audience will join her in

prayer fora new house to match

the big doorstep she found float-
ing in the flood waters of the Mis-

. . sissippi River.

The doorstep contrasts the
ugly shack the family calls
home, and the story evolves‘
around efforts to buy the “Shoe-
pick” place which is being sold
for delinquent taxes. The Com-
modore’s blunders result in fam-
ily conflicts and both Arthur
and Topal, oldest son. and

daughter leave home. But Mrs.
Crochet finally comes through
despite disappointments ‘ from
brother Dewey and a Texas
engineer, Mr. Tobin.

The result is a_ show packed
with incidents and relatively fast-
moving ‘despite the fact characters
are supposedly shiftless and slow.

If her lilies "are as fine as the
supporting cast, then Mrs. Cro-
chet should have no trouble sell-
ing “them. Tala Lupovitz’s merry,
naive. Evvie makes one wish she
weren’t headed for the convent.
,Nick Pranics’ Arthur and Virginia
Van Goethem as Mrs. Dupre pro-
vide two of the show’s funniest
scenes when he gets stuck with a
"pool ball, and she with the rent.

Dorothy Tear as Topal should,
by Saturday night, receive an
answer to her very convincing
love letters; and Kenneth Fold-
men’s Dewey should be a proto-
type for future river captains.
Thomas Klaric, Tobin; Bernard
Koperek, Tayo Delacroix; and
Rita. Heston, Mrs. _Beaumont
Crochet, the ﬂorist, wrap up the
important character roles well.

Aside from early dialogue which
adds depth to the production but
moves slowly, there is little to
find fault. Director Harvey Pope,
assistant Greta Gath and student
thespians offer a lilting show,
dressed in Southern vernacular
which would provide fitting activ-
ity, towards a well-rounded uni-

versity weekend.

Delbert N. Do Young receiveda BS. in Chem. Eng. from the ‘University,
of Wisconsin last June. Now he is working for an MS. degree. By asking
questions, he’s learned that many excellent industrial opportunities are
passed over because they're not understood by the-average undergraduate.

Clarence ,"Ding”” Bell answers:

  Del De Youngwants toknow:

 What sort of     

involved in ,
technical sales  
at Du Pont ?  

Clarence D. Boll, B.S., Chem. Eng., Univ. of ,

Pitts. (1937 ), joined Du Pont as a chemical engineer .
immediately after graduation. He began in the re-

search group of the Ammonia Department, pro-

gressed steadily through assignments on nylon and a g

numberiof other products. Today he is an Assistant

Director of Sales in the Polychemicals Department.’

 

Well, if I said “All sorts,” it might sound a bit vague to
you, Del, but it would be very close to the truth. That’s
because technical sales work‘ at Du Pont—bearing in
mind the great diversity of products we have——is. broader
in scope than a lot of other technical assignments, and
requires additional talents. ‘ ‘
»Let’s'. suppose that one of Du Pont’s customers is
having technical difﬁculties—needs help in adapting

V “Teﬂon” to a speciﬁc gasketing application, for exam-

ple. VVhen our salesrepresentative calls, he naturally
must carry with him the engineering knowledge that’s
the basis for sound technical advice—'data onﬂexural
fatigue, chemical passivity, and defonnation under load.
The customer is receptive. He wants to make a better
product, increase his sales, reduce costs——or do all
Naturally, he’s looking for reliable technical advice and
intelligent actions that apply to his speciﬁc conditions.
With the cooperation of the customer and help from
our own research people, when necessary, the problem
will sooner or later be “licked.”

We have found, though, that if a technical service

man is going to be truly effective in such a situation, he
must possess certain human qualities in addition. to his
technical ability. That is, he must really like people "and ‘
be sincerely interested in helping them solve their prob-
lems. He must—-‘in every sense of the word—be an
“ambassador”, - who can handle human. relationships
smoothly and effectively- ~ .

Take the depth suggested by -this simple example,
Del, and mu1tiply'it by a breadth representing all the
challenging problems you’ll run into with Du Pont’s
diversity’ of products. ﬁt" your slide rule isn’t too far out
of alignment, the resulting areagshomd give you some
idea of what I meant by “all sorts” of Work.

Let me emphasize one more point. The importance of
effective sales work’ is fully understood and appreciated
at Du Pont! In the past, sales work has been one of the
active roads to top management jobs. There is every
reason to believe that this will continue in the future.

Arc you inclined toward sales work? There are four main
types of sales activity in the Du Pont Company—-tech-
nical sales service, sales developmentgmarket research
and direct selling. Information on sales, and many other
facts about working with Du Pont, are given in “The
Du Pont Company and the College Graduate.” Write for

I "Boy you. fouled’ THAT. time."

its Deliatable     :

. By JIM DeWEESE _
Pitt is “Coddling Communism” or at ‘least E. F. Tomp-
kins seems to think so «according to a nationally syndicated

column which he attempts to write. . » - _
Tompkins, like many writers,‘ failed either to think
about his subject or else he deliberately set out to call at-

\tention to his literary endeavors.

I1’L~hlS column, Tompkins- states that the selection of a
topic (Diplomatic recognition of the Communist Chinese
Government), compels one team in every contest to advo-
cate the Communist cause.”\If, as Tompkins would have _us
believe, diplomatic “recognition of a government implies
that. the State Department advocates that government, the

democracy which is the United States must be held together

by nothing more solid than a piece of paper. A
Tompkins quotes President Cushing of Kearney State
College as saying that the choice of Red China as a debaters’
subject “showed a desireto indoctrinate students.” Per-
haps a more suitable question might be the pros ‘and cons
of whether either of these gentlemen are capable of focus-

‘ ing their near sighted gaze past the tips of their respective ‘

noses.

The primary purpose of collegiate and intercollegiate
debate is to foster the growth of a well ordered and logical
thinking process in the minds which will guide the destiny
of the world: The untold hours .of research which every
college debater spends g-athering material for his subject
serve more than a single purpose.

A It is quite probable that the vast majority of college
: students debating this topic know not only much more

about the question but also much more_ about the problem
of Red China than does Tompkins. Should he by chance wish
to discover what he is talking about he need only sit in on
a few colloge debate sessions.

By Joan Thomas ~
It’was a bitter December day and Frieda and

Fannie were sipping hot chocolate in the Tuck

Shop before their ﬁrst class. They were discussing

problems that one is bound to meet at an. institu-

tion of higher learning. L

Frieda: Our Soc. class was discussing one of the
columns‘ that appeared in the Pitt News last
Wednesday. "

Fannie: One of those discussions
that is student prompted to
take up class time, huh,
Fried? _ -

Frieda. No, I think this was a
pretty high brow thing the
way they were getting riled «
up about it. Something about
a barber shop.

Fannie: They really had a lot
of views on it?

Frieda: No, one of the kids over on the right gave
his idea on it, and he must have been pretty
smart because everybody agreed with ' him,
even the teacher.

Fannie: You mean they pretended to?"

 

' Frieda: No, Fan, I think they really did, because,

like I said, they got pretty riled up. Some
students think for themselves once in a while.
Fannie: I guess they were talking about the hidden
points in the column?
Frieda: Oh sure, these college kids ’never miss a

~ , 0

Fannie: What was the point? .

Frieda: Well, like I said, Fan, the article was talk
ing about a barber shop and the writer _tried
to say it had a matted rug in it.

Fannie: No! A matted rug in a barber shop. Any-
body knows better than that. I can see why
they got so mad. .

Frieda: Sure, they said the writer didn’t know
what she was talking about.

Fannie: Well, they were right of course. Anybody
that says there’s a straw rug in a barber shop
obviously doesn’t know anything.‘

Frieda: That’s the trouble anymore, I guess. These
modern writers keep choosing subjects they
know nothing about.

Fannie: Sure, she deserves. ridicule for writing about
a barber shop when it’s sure she’s never been
in one.

Friedazf That’s what my old English 1 teacher used
to say. ' ‘

Fannie: What’s that, Fried?

Frieda: That a writer has to be sure: of his sub-
ject, or he never gets his point across to the
reader. _

Fannie: I’ll go, along withthat. I hear it’s hard
enough to get points across to the reader when
you do know what ‘you’re talking about.

Frieda: Well, there’s “the bell, Fan. I gotta hurry.
This is a good class, lots of good discussions,
and I don’t want to miss anything.

By Bernice M. Cohen
The purpose of a college edu-
cation cannot be stereotyped into
a Single meaning. Every indi-

vidual’s conception of a singular .

deﬁnition of the supreme bene ts
of acquiring a formal education
differ. I

It is generally stated that a

equip the in-1
dividual .. with
the ideas and
experiences of
th e a d u 1 t '

is said to be a
stepping stone

ices of life..
Therefore, stu-
dents must be ,
permitted to think for themselve
in realistic situations that will-
face them in the near future.
Controversial Question ,

Quite controversial within the
student body is the question of
whether Pitt should have recog-

nized political parties. Each and _

every student is now, or will be
faced shortly, withthe duty and
privilege to vote for our leaders.

Individuals often fall into a rut

By Sam Morton

“By now it has become painfully
apparent that the so-called, “free
"ﬁfth hour” wasn’t such a good
idea after all. Billed as an “ac-
tivity hour,” it has only turned
the University and environs into
a mob scene '
reminiscent of

days. M a n y
solutions have
been suggest-
ed, but Dr.
J oh n Dewey

most: versatile
professor, has
come up with
what might be

the answer to .
this most pressing problem.

Two Party System lndorsed . . . ’

Political Parties Benefit

and lose their individuality as

\ soon as they join a group merely

because parents or sgcial friends
belong. Our national elections
illustrate the values of democracy
in permitting every voter to sup-
port whomhe chooses. Thus the
intelligent citizen has weighed the
beliefs of all contending candi-
dates c a r e f u 1 l y beforehand.
-Therefore it is surprising that the
large majority of our highly edu-
cated, citizens vote year after

year‘ in staunch support of a --

party, when they know little if
anything about the platform of
their chosen -group.
Understanding Platforms
An important beneﬁt of ‘having

I a lesson in understanding’ plat-

forms. In permitting every stu-

dent to form‘ his own opinions, on,

all issues and undertakings of a
group, a valuable life-long lesson
would be learned. ,. Not to be

overlooked would be the lesson in

the judgement of the sincerity‘ of
fellow contemporaries. ,If -men
and women, as college students,
are not permitted to learn these
values now, an important rung
of life’s ladder will be continually
stumbled upon. ’

Within the last year, Pitt has

had two unsanctioaed political

parties. (Formed as _a fraternity

students. Although they were not
approved, they suﬁiciently proved
that the spirit of competition. dur-

~ ing election time raised the vote
and encouraged thinking.

Lack of school spirit and en-

Pitt. Students, working for a

_common cause, wouldhave the
enthusiasm and anticipation so
necessary to remedy this situa-
tion. This device would be a

challenging interest‘ for all, not ,
just for thosewho enjoy football,

and dancing.

Pittpolitical parties would en- ‘

able every student to feel he had
some part in the decision of his
leaders. Whether or not an in-
dividual is a leader is not irnb

necessary, for they, as the mass
of humanity, make the "decisions

The Bel Air 4-Door $edan——ona of 14 new

Maybe once in a car-buying lifetime, you
come across something that breaks all the
old patterns and establishes new ones. This
is that kind of car. This is the true story of
how Chevrolet and General ‘Motors shaped
anew idea in steel.

Like most good ideas, this one is pretty simple. Chevrolet and
General Motors set out to build the ﬁrst low—priced car that
would: ‘

0 bring you the vcryfrcshcst and finest styling to be had.

0 bring you the most advanced engine design and engz'necrz'ngfcaturcs.x

0 bring you the kind of performance and the kind of ride that have
never been available before in a low-priced car.

0 bring you the highest quality of manufacture and materials.
All this in Chevrolet’s price ﬁeld? That ‘did take some doing!
And isn’t it logical that only Chevrolet. and General Motors
have the people, skills, resources and facilities, to carry out this
‘ exciting new idea? Here is how

Although the million dollar Field House doesn’t have
cracks in the ceiling, the stars will still‘ shine throughvfor
this year’s Steel Bowl. ,

These stars, however, represent the Pitt, Duquesne, Ford-
ham and George Washington basketball squads. The host
team’s star, Ed Pavlick, has al-° ’

in the season opener against Ohio
State.

The other luminary familiar to
Field House observers is Du— A

more Steel Bowl records than any
other performer. The 6-7 senior
has always been at his best in

Panthers Host Colonels
As Dukes Engage Rams

By GENE AROMATORIO
They’ll be settingpup doubleheaders at the Field House
tonight and tomorrow with the shots being served up by
four basketball teams representing some of the top college
talent in the nation—-Pitt, Duquesne, Fordham, and George

Washington.

By thistime some fans’ might be asking what the big
doings is all about. Well, in case they haven’t read a news-

paper for a month, it’s the fourth‘
annual Steel Bowl Tournament to
be held at the hoop arena.

Th e doubleheaders, _however,

will be just a little diﬁerent than
the ones served across the bar.
These will be in the form of two
basketball games played on both
nights as part of, the round-robin
tourney.
A Panthers in First —

Tonight will have the ‘Panthers
pitted against George Washing-
ton’s Colonials in the ﬁrst game,
starting at 7:30, and the segiond
fray will have Duguesne’s Dukes
matched with Fordham’s Rams. '

To refresh the memories of
hardwood fans, a quick rundown‘
on last year’s records. of these
quintets shows the Dukes ending
the season with a 28-3 slate, the
Colonials ﬁnishing up with 23-3,
the Rams making up an18-6 slate,
and the Panthers closing with 9-
14;

Coach Bob Timmons’ big con-
cern at the ‘moment is George
Washington and a couple of guys
called Corky Devlin and‘ Joe
Holup. These are the two boys
who teamed up last year to pop in
1098 points-551 and 547 respec-
tively. .

Tech Surprises

Right now the way the things
are going for the Panthers it looks
like they might have some rough
sledding ‘against the Colonials.
After coming through the ﬁrst
three games without a win, their
latest losing effort being against ‘
Carnegie Tech, the prospects aren’t
looking much better with these

  A Panther Fro sh spun;
_~ Whips Tartans, 71-64

Battling a determined and aggressive ‘Tech freshmen‘
squad, the Panther Frosh put on a fourth quarter rally to
win a see‘-saw contest from the Skibo yearlings, 71-64, at the

Skibo gym Wednesday night.

The cubs opened up. to an early lead and at the end

of the first period held a 20-10

advantage. Bill’ Dillon led this
initial quarter barage with eight’
points.

In the second period the Pittites
moved to ‘ a thirteen point lead
when Coach Carl Peterson reliev-

- ed his starting five with reserves.

Against the second-stringers, the
Carnegie freshmen put on a come-
back rally and at half time the
score was tied with an amazing
shot from mid-court by Tech’s
John Tucci. V _
The contest see-sawed back and
forth throughout the third period

swith neither team gaining more

than a four- point advantage. At
the end of this quarter the score
was again tied at 56-56. _

Chuck Hursh opened the final
period with a foul shot before
Dillon and Phil Klieman followed
with a tap and a push shot respec-
tively to give the cubs a 61-56
lead. Two Tech scores brought the
Tartans within two points but ‘a
tap by Klieman and a push shot
and foul by Dillon put the Pan-
thers six points ahead and they
were never headed after that.

High scorer for the Panther
Frosh, for the third straight game,
was Julius Pegues, with 14 points.

Pegues now has 61 points in three

games for a 20.3 average. Second
high‘ man for the Panthers was
_Dillon with 13 while Howie Lester-
tallied ten.

Riflers Start Shooting Today
In Greater Pittsburgh League

The Panther shartpshooters open their 1954-55 season
this evening against Duquesne at the latter’s range. The

_ team, coached bySgt. Gromkog will vie again this year with

West Virginia, Washington and Jefferson, Duquesne, and
Tech, for honors in the Greater Pittsburgh League.

Although the Pittites have drop-¢
’ ped two exhibition matches this

year, one to the Oakmont Sport
Club and the other to the Murrys..
ville Sport Club, Sgt. Gromko fig-
ures his team totbe stronger than
last year’s entry. Reason for this
optimism lies in the fact that nine
out of last y-ear’s ten starters are
back again.

-The ten men scheduled to fire
tonight include, Tom Shepperd
team captain, David Jacobson,
Robert Vandergrift, Tom Claric,
James Cleary, Robert Barrickman,
John Beneacquista, Al Johnson,
Richard Greene, and R i c h a r d
O’Reilly. ,

Scoring in riﬂe is based on
individual effort with each man
firing ten rounds from the,prone,
kneeling, and standing position
with 300 being a perfect score.
The team total is the aggregate
score of the‘ five highest men.

Although. University rules pro-
hibit the use of freshmen on»var-
sity teams, the sergeant has re-
ceived offers from district col-
leges for matches on the fresh-
men level. The one drawback to
a freshmen riﬂe team, which
would be the first in University
history, is the lack of interest in
the freshman class as shown when
only seven came out for the team.

It is the sergeant’s hope, though,
that more ,candidates will try out

and that freshmen team will be

able to compete.

There are only 300 thousand
wooden cigar store Indians left

in the U. S. In 1901, there were

1 million.

City Title Again .

Sparkling defensive play highlighted the All-City touch
football championship game last Wednesday in which Pitt’s
Phi Delta Theta knocked off Alpha Tau Omega of Carnegie
Tech at the Skibo Bowl to win their second consecutive

city title.

Last year the Pitt representa-
tives defeated. Duquesne in the
championship game, 26-20. The
Phi Delts are now undefeated and
untied in 23 consecutive games.

Even though they were. playing
in freezing weather, the,Phi Delts

took an early lead when Paul

Lack of Sponsor

Halts Steel Bowl
Telecasts, Others

There wil be no televising of
the Steel Bowl games this year.
Whereas last year WENS-TV
televised several Pitt basketball
games, including the Steel Bowl
when it - became known that it
would be a sellout, sports director

of a sponsor will make it impos-
sible to put the tourney on the
air either tonight or tomorrow.

_, He explained that last years
telecasts were sustained, that is
all- expenses were absorbed by
the station, and high costs will not
permit the UHF station to telecast
the games this year. Also included
in last year’s video program was
a local wrestling meet.

Phi Delts outstanding line play,
led by Jim Trebac, kept the Tech
team’s backﬁeld constantly off
balance. , . '

When the Omegas got their
passes away, Ted Mathews or Doc
Shanafelt usually were able to
break them up.

During the second and third
periods, the Pitt representatives
often threatened to score, but
their attack would bog down, when
they neared the Omega goal.
‘Twice they penetrated to within
a few yards of the goal, mostly be-

Announce Plan
For New Dance

By AL LEFFLER
Plans for a Freshman Class
dance will be announced after con-
sideration by the Student Con-
gress and approval of the execu-
tive, it was announced at the SC
meeting on Monday, Dec. 6.
Arnold Landy, president of the
freshman Bus. Ad. class, was led
to believe that SC had charge of
the reserve fund and that he
needn’t worry about ﬁnancial
affairs. I
With this in mind, he presented
his idea to Bea Pelligrino, chair-
man of the social committee, who
I should have in turn had it ap-
proved by her committee.
Misunderstanding the procedure,
due to the rec nt appointment of
the junior and senior oﬂicers to
class sponsorship of dances by SC,
Bea presented the idea as part of

1 her report to Congress.

The solons weren’t clear as to
who had the power to approve
Landy’s proposal, which may lead
to a clariﬁcation of the delegation
of SC powers in the next few
weeks. Emil Herman, president of
SC, felt that most people in the
University do not know the proper
channels through which such plans
must pass. Possibly freshman ori-
entation should include such in-
struction as part of their course.
> In the same discussion, Mr.

George Elliot, assistant to the
Dean of Men, clariﬁed the pro-
cedure for spending when an all
University event is involved.
I First, events should be carefully
I planned to insure that they will at
least break even. Should there be

E/vening School 2 Student Holds \
Avocation of Grapho-Analysis

Analyst_Ehrolled
In Evening School
Workshop Course

BY SHIRLEY. PUDLES

According to Mrs. Luce M
Ong, ‘Pitt evening school stu-
dent and part time writing
analyst, “people who always
loop their a’s, g’s, and o’s when
writing may tell the truth but
are capable of a deceiving
poker face.”

She’ rescribes graphic-analysis
as" an unbiased, penetrating study

 

of individual character and per-'.,

sonality as revealed in a person’s
handwriting. ‘

Mrs. Ong’s study of this art as
a hobby resulted in her present
employment at the Park Schenley
Restaurant ballroom as _analyst of
guests’ handwriting. The African
born woman explained that
gra—phov-analysis is based on, the
principle “that as a man thinketh,
so is he.” Followers of this avoca-
tion believe that analysis reveals
the character of the writer and
mirrors his mental habits. This
theory is based on _the‘assumption
that individuals’ penstrokes are

, intimate physical -actions.

Varied Interests
However, handwriting analysis

is only one of many interests for

Mrs. Ong. Prior to her present job
as reservationist at the Pittsburgh
P l a t e Company in Gateway
Center_she was withthe ‘Arthur
Murray Dance Studio and Army
Transportation in Indiana and
New York where she .acted as a
flight operator for ‘the American
