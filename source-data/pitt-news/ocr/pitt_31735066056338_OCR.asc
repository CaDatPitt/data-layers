Malcolm X discussed 28 years after death        

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

On Feb. 21, 1965, Malcolm X was
murdered in New York City. Twenty-
eight years later to the day, speakers
gathered to offer their insights on the
controversial activist.

Pitt’s Kuntu Repertory Theatre and the
Malcolm X Holiday Commission, an
organization which is trying to institu-
tionalize Malcolm X’s birthday as an
African-American cultural holiday, pre-
sented a forum last night, “Malcolm X:
The Man, the Movie, the Assassination.”

Dr. Claire Cohen, member of the
Holiday Commission, critiqued the
movie Malcolm X and offered both
positive and negative aspects about the
controversial Spike Lee film.

Cohen said that the movie was a
superficial look at the activists life and
his message of revolution.

“Malcolm’s message was a scathing
critique of the dominant Anglo—Saxon
group in this country,” she said.

The movie failed to put the vision of
Malcolm and the Islamic movement, the
unification of black people, into per-
spective. It instead showed Malcolm X
as a person who operated by himself,
Cohen said.

“The movie was a personal, psycho-
logical look at Malcolm X, not a politi-
cal view of him,” Cohen said.

A positive result of the movie, accord-
ing to Cohen, is that it has “inspired
youth to study about Malcolm X, which

Neutralization is main
subject for Madhubuti

By Suzann Gries
Staff Writer

Haki R. Madhubuti, director
of the Institute of Positive
Education in Chicago and
professor of English at
Chicago State University, out-
lined African—American stu-
dents’ responsibilities at the
university.

Madhubuti, also the pub-
lisher and editor of the Tl9z'7'd
World Press, said it is
the African—American stu-
dents’ responsibility “to come
through this university with
as
you can use in the best inter-
est of yourself, in the
best interest of your family,
your extended family and
your people.”

He also said in his speech
last Thursday night in the
William Pitt Union that:
African—American students
must organize while in school
to make sure that fellow stu-
dents do not fail out of
school.

Madhubuti’s speech cen-
tered around the problems
that exist in the black
movement today. He said,

“You are here because of the
‘60s, you are here because of
the ‘50s and the ‘4()s, because
of the men and women that
preceded you.

"You are not here because
some people like you. You
are here because people
fought to get you into this
university.”

Madhubuti said that

the black movement which

existed in the ‘60s does not
exist today because of the
theory he calls “neutraliza-
tion.”

According to Madhubuti,
black men in America are
neutralized by their
oppressor,'the “white ruler-
ship.”

He said one way in which
African—American men are
neutrali’/.ed is to “create
black men and women, too,
who will be and act white
in their thought, actions and
energies This introduces
black men who constantly
work in the best interest of
their teacher.”

Another way to neutralize
African—American men is to
“drive black men out of the

Panhel and IFC work

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

The newly-elected
Panhellenic Association is
taking the initiative by con-
verting some of the ideas dis-
cussed at last weekend’s
Presidents’ Conference from
talk to action.

“The conference was very
successful,” Panhel President
Lorraine Shipley said. “Each
chapter of Panhel was repre-
sented, and we discussed
how Greeks can help resolve
various issues which Pitt stu-
dents need to deal with.”

The conference, held at
Hidden Valley, was a joint
effort by Panhel and the
Inter-Fraternity Council to
discuss programs and set
goals. Representatives from
member chapters of Panhel
and IFC were present to
exchange solutions and give
the Pitt Greek system a clear
direction.

together for Pitt Greeks

“It was a situation where
the Greeks ‘shared the
wealth’ between chapters,”
Panhel External Vice
President Julie Holaren said.
“We talked about certain sit-
uations and how some chap-
ters would solve those prob-
lems. We hope to plan com-
munity and scholarship
events as well as implement
more joint [Panhel-IFC] pro-
grams in the future.”

One of the projects imme-
diately being acted upon is
the Greek intramural sports
program.

“We are looking into some
type of intramural program
for sororities, hopefully coor-
dinated in' some way with
IFC intramurals,” Holaren
said.

A reform in the sparsely
attended Greek 101 series of
seminars is another issue on
which Panhel is working.

Pitts pbilosoplay center
gets $1 million apple

By Katie Kaminski
Staff Writer

One of Adolf Griinbaum’s former students thought he
was such an exceptional professor that he donated $1
million to Pitt in Gr1'inbaum’s name.

“One encounters a teacher like Professor Griinbaum
only once in a lifetime — if one is lucky,” said Harvey
E. Wagner, chairperson and chief executive of
T eknekron Corp., who donated $1 million to the Center
for Philosophy of Science at Pitt in Griinbaum’s name.

The center, founded in 1960 by Griinbaum, is widely
considered to be the world’s leading institute for
research in the philosophy of science,‘ according to a
press release from the Pitt's Department of University
Relations.

Griinbaum served as the center’s director until 1978.
He is currently its chairperson and an Andrew Mellon
Professor of Philosophy at Pitt.

Wagner was one of Gr1'inbaum’s students at Lehigh
University in the ‘50s. After graduating from Lehigh, he
attended graduate school and studied a new field called
operations research because of Griinbaum’s advice.
Wagner then founded Teknekron Corp., a developer of
marketable technologies involved in technology trans-
fer. _

Wagner said Griinbaum was the “principal intellectual

Controversy in the desert

By David Weimer
Staff Writer

From local to regional to
national to international.

‘‘It’s the first time there has
ever been an international
coalition between environ-
mental and indigenous
rights organizations of this
size,” said Josh Knauer,
spokesperson for Pittsburgh
Friends of Mt. Graham.

Knauer and Matt Peters,
president of Pitt's Student
Environmental Action
Coalition (SEAC), returned
Thursday from their trip to
Washington, I).C., where
they met with fellow envi-
ronmentalists and national
legislators.

They visited the nation’s
capital to meet with other
environmental groupsfrom
around the country to come
up with an opposition strat-
egy — a strategy for fighting
the Mt. Graham Telescope
Project in general and Pitt’s
possible involvement in par-
ticular.

Knauer said that getting
the University of Arizona
(UA) to move the telescope
array ()ff the mountain
would be “a major victory
for religious rights in the
United States, for environ-
mental rights and also a vic-
tory of people over corrupt
government and corrupt

Mt. Graham supporters
return from Washington

institutions.”

In a large conference
room on Tuesday — nation-
al, international and Native-
American groups decided
to form the National Friends
of Mt. Graham Coalition.

“This coalition is unique
because environmental and
indigenous groups are
working toward the same
goals. In the past, they
haven’t been able to form
this kind of coalition,” Peters
said.

Peters said that SEAC now
has the full support of the
coalition and should be
more effective in the future.

The coalition’s goals are to
educate people about Mt.
Graham, keep people up to
date on developments and
bring the issue out into the
open.

On Wednesday, Knauer
and Peters met personally
with Pennsylvania’s U.S.
Senators Harris Wofford and
Bill Bradley as well as the
aides of many Pennsylvania
representatives.

“I think our visits had
a great impact on
them. They all stated they
were very impressed
by the fact that we, as stu-
dents from Pittsburgh, felt
strongly enough to travel to
l).C. and get these appoint-
ment up with them,” Knauer
said.

Mt. Graham raises doubts

By David Weimer
Staﬂ Writer

In 1988, a rider was attached to
a congressional bill that enabled
the University of Arizona to
bypass a National Environmental
Protection Agency (NEPA) law in
order to begin construction of the
now—controversial telescope facili-
ty atop Mount Graham in the
Pinaleno Mountains southwest of
Safford, Arizona.

The congressional rider —— a
part of the Arizona—Idaho
Conservation Act — was passed
based on a rigged biological
opinion of the Mt. Graham habi-
tat submitted by two federal biol-
ogists. The biologists admitted
skewing the report in their sworn
statements filed in a U.S. District
Coun.

Trees were cut down, concrete
was poured and opposition to
the telescope project began to
rise.

People began to oppose the
telescope project because, they
say, it threatens a unique ecosys-
tem and an endangered squirrel
living on the mountain. They say
it also infringes upon the religion
of Native Americans who worship
near the proposed site.

In the 1970s, the University of
Arizona (UA) developed a tech-
nique for casting honeycombed
telescope mirrors in a spinning
fumace, thus allowing UA’s mir-
ror lab to create larger and lighter
weight mirrors that required less
polishing. UA, the organizing
body of the Mt. Graham project,
wants to showcase these mirrors
in the planned observatory.

Germany’s Max Planck
Institute. the Vatican and Italy’s
Arcetri Observatory are the only
other organizations that have
added their support.

The University of Pittsburgh
has been invited by UA to take
part in the project. Pitt is one of
the last U.S. institutions to be
approached and is currently the
only one besides UA to be
involved.

Curiously, no other American
institution endorses the project. In
fact, Ohio State University,
Harvard, Smithsonian, Universities
of Texas and Chicago, California
Institute of Technology, National
Optical Astronomy Observatories
(NOAO) and the National
Aeronautical & Space
Administration (NASA) have all
withdrawn their support of the
telescope project.

The dwindling support may
result from a realization that the
project is not worthy of scientific
consideration. What, after all, is
the principle scientific importance
of this proposed telescope array?

The answer is lost behind the
outcries of environmentalists and
indigenous rights activists.

If the project is of great astro-

News
'I\

Analysis

nomical significance, why must
Pitt stand alone in support of it?
Do other organizations and uni-
versities lack a simple conviction
that Pitt alone has?

There are at least two possible
reasons Pitt’s astronomy depart-
ment is interested in the Mt.
Graham project: prestige and
experience. Prestige in being
associated with a scientific project
of noteworthiness and the experi-
ence that students and professors
of astronomy would gain by
going to Arizona to work directly
with the. equipment.

Some may mention the new
stellar information that the project
would bring to light, but that can
be brought to question. An
NOAO comparison of Mt.
Graham with Hawaii’s Mauna
Kea failed to show the Arizona
site as superior. Another NOAO
study showed there were 38 con-
tinental U.S. sites that were better

than Mt. Graham.

Last week, the president of
Pitt’s Student Environmental
Action Coalition (SEAC) and the
spokesperson for Pittsburgh
Friends of Mt. Graham, went to
Washington, l).C., to meet with
representatives of national and
international environmental
groups to form a broad coalition
that will maintain future commu-
nication via telephone, letter, E-
mail and Fax.

They worked with these
groups to develop a “strategy” for
fighting the telescope project, and
they also met with congressional
lawmakers and their aids to dis-
cuss the issue of the Arizona
mountain.

Protests occur regularly now on
the UA campus; an active Friends
of Mt. Graham group is here at
Pitt for the duration until the fight
is over; and Pittsburgh environ-
mental groups are gearing up for
a long ﬁght with project support-
ers.

The rising opposition and
protesting in Pittsburgh over a
single mountain in Arizona seem
odd. Until one shifts to the per-
spective of these people.

Wackos, freaks and fanatics
exist, but it is unlikely that these
names will apply to more than a
small percentage of the members
in organizations opposed to the
building of telescopes on Mt.
Graham.

A common thread in these
protests, whether it is a Pittsburgh
environmentalist shouting out or
a member of Germany's Big
Mountain Action Group giving a
talk, is this: they feel that the Mt.
Graham issue is important in and
of itself because it concerns envi-
ronmental laws, obeyed or bro-
ken, and cultural laws/rights,
observed or ignored.

More crucial to the protestors.
though, is the amount of damage
these same laws or rights will sus-
tain if the “wrong” (insert relative
deﬁnition) precedent is set in this
highly representative case of Mt.
Graham.

Tournament Chess
is a mental sport

By Dave Popelka
and Elizabeth Burton
For T be Pitt News

Bishops conquered rooks, a
few pawns got wasted and
knights were jumping all over
the place yesterday in the
William Pitt Union. Sound like
a B-rated medieval adventure?
Wrong, it was the continuing
saga of the Chess Club
Tournaments.

Thirty teams participated in
the event including students

from Carnegie Mellon,
California University of
Pennsylvania, Indiana

University, Pitt-Greensburg
and a few independent play-
ers.

“llt is] a fantastic event,”
said Tom Magar, president of
the Pittsburgh Chess League.

Each team consisted of four
players and up to six alter-
nates that play one Sunday a
month from September to
April. On a typical day there
can be up to 150 players.

"There are a wide range of
players from Grand Master,
which is the highest ranking
in the chess world, down to
beginners," event coordinator
Tom Martinak said.

One game at the tourna-
ment lasted for five hours.

Games are played on the
Swiss System, which allows

 

players to play in all rounds
of the tournament. A player
gets one point for each win
and a half point for a draw.

A match is made up of a
series of four games, and the
main goal is to get amatch
point. The team must earn
two—and-a—half game points
for a match point.

Matches are assigned
according to rank, pitting the

top players against each
other.
Tournament chess is a

“mental sport” played by
70,000 Americans, according
to Magar. He said the appeal
of the game for avid players is
“the clash of ideas and wills.”

A good chess player needs
the ability to see ahead and
predict the moves of his
opponent. “Hard work and a
love of the game” are attribut-
es of a good chess player,
Magar said.

Because matches have been
known to go as long as eight
hours, players need to resist
fatigue while maintaining
focus and energy.

The Pittsburgh Chess
League is one of the biggest
leagues in the United States
Chess Federation, the national
ranking system. Pitt’s Chess
Club plays Tuesdays in the
William Pitt Union. (Your

doing my thing differently.”

Marshall, an African-
American woman with a
warm, solid laugh, says she
is impressed with the stu-
dents at Pitt, especially with
how serious they are about
their education. She says
she has become friends
with many other students in
her classes and refers to
them as “my kids at
school.”

“I love a lot of them,” she
adds.

Marshall, 40-something,
was born in Akron, Ohio,
and married right out of
high school. She went to
Sawyer Business College in
Akron, earning a certificate
in executive secretarial
skills.

Even at the start of her
career as an executive sec-
retary, Marshall considered
getting a four—year degree
and began to take classes
after her oldest daughter
was born. But she realized
that between working all
day and attending evening

classes, she had no time to
spend with her baby.

“I told myself; you know
you had choices and you
made them, and one of the
choices you made was to
marry and have this child,”
she says. She stopped tak-
ing classes and continued
with her career, later having
another child.

In 1987, Marshall’s mar-
riage ended in divorce.
With her children grown,
she went back to class. She
got an associate degree in
communications and then
decided to continue her
studies at the University of
Akron, again majoring in
communications with
minors in English and black
studies.

While studying for her
degree, Marshall began dat-
ing her present husband,
Richard, and'they married,
giving her an instant new
family: Richards two
teenagers Patrice, I7, and
Brian, 15.

This time, Marshall con-
tinued her studies since her
stepchildren are older. The
teenagers met her while she
was a student and are coin-
fortable with her in that
role. Marshall says that her
example as a student is
helping her “younger fami-

ly” by showing them that
the way to succeed in
school is to work hard at it.

In 1990, Marshall’s hus-
band was transferred to
Pittsburgh. The family
moved to Monroeville and
Marshall promptly enrolled
at Pitt. She attended part
time until they were settled
in, and is now pressing
ahead full time to finish in
August.

This year'is full of pres-
sure for Marshall both at
school and at home.
Besides the push to get her
degree, she juggles a full
home life: laundry, cooking,
caring for her family and
frequent visits to her moth-
er, who is in a nursing
home.

Marshall’s biggest wish is
to find more time to study.
“I really want to know this
stuff. I’m sitting in class
thinking, ‘I missed knowing
this all these years.‘ And
there's so much to learn. It
brings me so much plea-
sure. Every bit of knowl-
edge just brings me joy."

Marshall says she does
plan to go back to work
after graduation and has the
skills and work experience
to command a good salary,
but she is considering going
for a master’s degree.

them to take care of them-
selves and their families in
the so—called American
way,” Madhubuti said.

According to Madhubuti,
“neutrali/,ation” has bee.n
effective in keeping
African Americans out of
power positions.

“Most black people
in this country are ward
to the state, and this
dependency has rendered
many of them netitral in
the fight for their own lib-
eration.

"Therefore, it is manda-
tory that African-American
people develop survival
strategies," he said.

The “bone of change,"
according to Madhubuti,

is “the ability to look
at oneself as honestly
as possible and design a
personalized program for
change.”

“It is clear that we
men have got to open up.
We got to open up to each
other. We got to open tip
to the women that we
are with. But most certain-
ly, we got to open up to
ourselves,” he said.

turer and community
worker, received the
American Book Award in
1991 and was named
Author of the Year for

is important.”

Bob Gore, a founder of the Congress of
Racial Equality, spoke on the experiences he
had with Malcolm X.

Although Gore was not a personal friend of
Malcolm X, he said that the man was a great
influence in his life.

According to Gore, it was Malcolm X who
taught him to question the system and gave
him a sense of liberation. Malcolm X influ-
enced people by his words and his actions,
he said

“It was he who taught me that casting
off the chains was not the end of the
story. The next step is to organize our-
selves, to make sure the chains stay off,"
Gore said.

Rashid Sundiata, a researcher and scholar
on Malcolm X, spoke of the activists assassi-
nation.

Sundiata spoke of the history of slayings of
other African—American activists including
l)avid Walker and Nat Turner.

He said that each time a slaying occurred it

was a message to African Americans telling
them that they could never be important, that
they were brought to this country only to
serve people.

Mustapha Hassain, formerly Robert X, lived
with Malcolm in 1952 and worked with him
to build the Nation of Islam in Detroit and
other cities.

“It is a beautiful thing that the youth are
wearing the clothes with X on it,” Hassain
said. "But the youth should understand what
the X means.”

Hassain explained that the X was a name
given to members of the Islamic Nation to
use in place of their surname to symbolize
unification.

He. said that Malcolm X did not stand for
drug or alcohol abuse, he stood for peace
and encouraged today's young people to
stand for peace also.

“I)on‘t worship the dead, worship the liv-
ing, carry on the spirit [of Malcolm Xl."
Hassain said. "Be the peacemaker, not one
who maintains peace, but one who makes
peace where there is none.“

Representation needed

A battle is taking place in the district courts of the United States. A
black group, the Committee for Full and Fair Empowennent, is suing the
city of Pittsburgh. It is trying to get District judge l)onald E. Ziegler to
create a third black majority seat on a city council which currently has
seven white majority seats but only two black ones.

The case wont be settled until sometime after March 15, when the city
presents its defense to the. court, but in one way or another it will divide
the city of Pittsburgh along racial lines.

last week, Urban League President I/eon Haley told a federal court
judge that in tenns of housing, “Pittsburgh is one of the most segregated
communities in the United States."

The Urban League feels that if 80 percent or more of the residents in a
tract are of the same race, the neighborh<x)d is considered segregated.
According to this definition, most of Pittsburgh‘s black citi'/ens live in
segregated census tracts.

Electing a third black member to the council will not solve all of the
problems facing the black community in Pittsburgh. But it would help.

The black infant death rate in Pittsburgh is three times that of white
infants, the black unemployment rate is seven times the white unem-
ployment rate and 35 percent of all blacks live below the federal poverty
line. At every level of govemment, the current system of representation
has failed to address these problems adequately.

Every so often redistricting occurs. But it usually reflects changes in
population. not demographics. It would be nice if the city could settle
this case out of court, since it only serves to divert attention away from
the real problems. A court battle will only cost time, money and stir up
animosity. The problems facing the black communities are not merely
“black problems.“ and a third majority black representative more sensi-
tive to the problems facing this city could only help Pittsburgh to allevi-
ate many of the problems it faces.

The Haitian problem

Hardly a mention was made of the ship vvhich sunk off the coast of
Haiti on \\"ednesday aftemoon. One of the \vorld‘s worst maritime disas-
ters, the Neptune was canying 1500 people and had only 500 survivors.
To put this figure in perspective. the sinking of the Titanic resulted in
1,3()(»plus deaths. Still, it was barely mentioned in the middle pages of
the Netti Yonb ‘limes on Sunday. And not a word of it was written in the
\t"asbi‘2zg/mi Post.

Thousands of people died. More will die as they eagerly await
entrance into the United States. The question about what to do with the
Haitian refugees is a difficult one —— which is why President Clinton
backed off on his earlier promise to allow them to enter the country.

Problems have arisen because many have tested HIV positive.
Without the ability to provide adequate healthcare coverage to our own
people, the issue has arisen as to whether or not we can afford to pay
their health costs as well. Secondly, despite the economic upturn of this
country, there has not been an increase in overall employment figures.
Until the Gross Domestic Product starts growing strongly, most Haitians
will arrive in the United States with the unrealistic hope of attaining a
job.

But for centuries the United States has opened its borders to refugees
ﬂeeing political oppression. There is a humanitarian stake here, and the
benefits of saving those Haitian's ﬂeeing persecution cxlsily outweigh the
costs. "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses ...," wrote
Emma Iazurus.

However, other options must be explored. The United States should
take the lead and pressure other nations to freeze what few assets Haiti
possesses. Furthemiore, economic embargoes and trade restrictions with
this small and poor country would cause the current government to
crumble.

Eliminate the root of the problem, and Haitian refugees will no longer
be an issue.

Try Telefact: You'll probably like it

\Writers of perspective
columns often get a lot of
flack for the opinions they
make public through their
medium of newsprint. Last
week, I wrote a column
addressing a Student
Government Board meeting I
had attended. Since then, I‘ve
received quite a few corn-
ments and criticisms about the
opinions in that column. One
of our student
Telefact, wrote a letter which
ran the day after my column.
In that letter, Telefact offered
me the opportunity to come to
its office and work the phones
so I could see how the
employees go about their
business. Last Wednesday
night, I took them up on their
offer.

During my short stay at the
office, I talked with a few of
the employees. I learned a lot
about the kind of activity that
goes on there. According to
the student coordinator of
Telefact, employees are select-
ed because they possess a cer-
tain eccentricity or quality
which makes them useful to
the service they are providing.
This was quite apparent.

One of the young women
who works at the office was
able to give me the phone
number and name of the near-
est pet store — right off the
top of her head. Pretty neat.
Still, some may ask, “Hey, just
how does Telefact get
the money it needs to oper-
ate?”

students are granted the right
to know any information
regarding the use of their stu-
dent monies. just thought I’d
let you know.

Telefact is given a ye.arly
budget by the school, and it
petitions SGIS for money as
well. This money goes toward
student hourly wages (Telefact
employs 17 students who
work part time) and the

Chris
Diersen

Telefact phone bills. With this
money, they call various
places, none of which are out-
side of the continental United
States. But if a student
believes that the question they
are asked merits a phone call,
they are free to call anywhere
in the U.S. The calls they field
at Telefact are far more out-
landish than even I could con-
coct. Where these folks come
up with their ideas, I couldn’t
guess. For example: “How
many trees are there on the
Cathedral lawn?" and, “How
many square feet does the jazz
display occupy in the union?”
My question is, once again,
“Who cares?” But, then again,
I guess it isn’t my place to ask
such a question.

Seriously though, Telefact
does provide a relatively
important service. Among the
more frequently asked ques-

tions are, “\‘(/hat’s for dinner?"
and, “What‘s the weather fore-
cast?"

Telefact is more a conve-
nience than a necessity, but at
least it is a useful conve-
nience. I can think of many
places where money has been
spent in less productive ways
by our school. My only con-
cern about Telefact is the
unmonitored use of the
phones for long distance calls.
The workers are entrusted to
follow the honor system. I
don’t know 

Monetary wastefiilness at
Pitt, as at other schools, is an
important concern that often is
not given enough attention.
Overall, after my experience
with Telefact, I feel that I can
safely conclude that it is a
worthwhile and useful ele-
ment of our campus. It is one
of the few extras that the
school offers that provides a
service to all students (and
non—students for that matter)
rather than being a group ded-
icated for use by a specific
group. And isn’t that where
the school should spend its
money anyway? So many of
our organizations, clubs and
groups are there for a small
faction of our university coin-
munity.

Services such as Telefact do
not discriminate on any basis.
You have a question? Give
them a call. More than likely,
they'll be able to answer it.

Bench betrays Pitt basketball

Beaten at their own game — in their
own building.

For the Pitt basketball team, a promi-
nent part of the successful ‘92—’93 season
has been the constant effort of the men
in the blue and gold warmups — the
Panther reserves.

With Marlon Rhymes, Brian Brush,
Orlando Antigua and Chris Gant leading
the subsurge, Pitt’s back-ups have pro-

vided a flurry of bursts for Paul Evans
whenever called upon — averaging 23.1
points a night while playing major roles
in huge road wins over Boston College
and Illinois.

But in Saturday night’s home loss to
Connecticut, the Panthers’ bench per-
formed the role normally the trademark

Penn State Wrestling backs up top ranking

By Rob Pugliese

Sports Assistant

Facing the nation's top-ranked team pro-
vided a lot of things for the Pitt Panthers.
Foremost among them was a realistic
glimpse at the true meaning of being num-
ber one.

“We were in just aboutall the matches.
We lost a lot of the close matches, the
matches we usually win,” senior Steve
Budman said. “If it had been a lesser team,
I think we might have won a lot of those
matches. I guess that’s why they're number
one in the country.”

Simply put, top-ranked Penn State
proved its superiority over Pitt Saturday
night, handling the Panthers 27-6 at
Connellsville High School. The unbeaten
Nittany Lions (21-0-1) continued their quest
toward a national championship, while the
Panthers (9-3-1) suffered their first setback

in six outings.

Penn State, despite being banged up,
entered the dual meet a prohibitive
favorite, still boasting six wrestlers ranked
in the top 10 in their respective weight
classes.

However, Pitt had wrestled tremendously
of late, coming off a 27-6 steamrolling of
West Virginia Thursday night.

Regardless of Saturday’s result, the
Panthers have wrestled like a Top-25 team,
evidenced by three impressive victories
and one tie against ranked competition.

But Penn State had shut out three :
straight opponents prior to beating West

Virginia Saturday morning. Among those
victims was a very talented Bloomsburg
team that the Lions hammered 39-0. It did
not take a genius to see that Pitt would
likely struggle in this one.

The two Panther victories came courtesy

A deflated Eric Mobley
kneeling moti()nless on the
Fitzgerald Field House floor
perhaps best expressed the
dangerous descent Pitt had
taken.

Just one week ago, the
Panthers were booking their
reservations for the NCAA
Tournament. That was until
disaster — namely back-to-
back Fitzgerald Field House
losses — struck and placed
March travel plans on
hold.

Mobley’s strained anguish
was the result of an inspired
Panther second—half come-
back that fell short, with Pitt
dropping an 81-80 heart-
breaker to red—hot
Connecticut before a disap-
pointed Field House crowd
of 6,798.

This was a tale of two
clubs heading in opposite
directions. Saturdays loss
closed a disastrous week in
which Pitt (15—7. 7-7 in the
Big East) lost two consecu-
tive Field House games for
the first time since the 1984-
’85 season and continued
spiraling downward with five
osses in its last seven
games.

“I thought we played just
horrendous in the first half,"
Pitt head coach Paul Evans
said. “It was just like the
Boston College game. In the
second half we rebounded
better and played better
defense. Hopefully the sec-
ond half was a bright spot
for us and will be a turn-
around for the rest of the
season.”

In short order, the
Panthers have fallen from
legitimate conference cham-
pionship contenders to
potential entrants in the
dreaded Thursday night

with 27-6 Win over Pitt

qualifying games at the Big
East Tournament.
Connecticut (13-8, 8-6) ran
its winning streak to four,
while, more importantly, col-
lecting another quality win
for the tournament selection
committee.

Pitt had a chance to tie the

Women's gym stinnbles

By Todd S. Rimer
Staff Writer

Coming off a disappointing
loss to Penn State, the Pitt
women’s gymnastics team was
looking to bounce back with a
strong outing this weekend as
the team travelled to our nation’s
capital to participate in a tri-meet
with Rutgers University and the
host team, George Washington
University.

Last week the team failed to
put it all together, and history
repeated itself this weekend.
Despite some mental errors and
some poor performances, the
team surprisingly managed to
attain over 182 points against
Penn State.

This weekend, poor perfor-
rnances by some of the gymnasts
led to Pitt’s worst meet of the
season with a total team score of

178.90. Rutgers University did
not fair much better with a score
of 180.6. George Washington
dominated on this day with a
team score of 18835.

This meet was no different
from any others this season in
that more season and career
highs were attained, but while
some of the gymnasts continue
to improve, others are getting
worse from week to week.

“Half the team is on fire while
the other half is not producing,”
Coach Debbie Yohman said.

The transition from practicing
in “the cage” to performing in
the meets has been the critical
problem facing the team.

“Like every week, we worked
even harder than the one before.
But we again failed to put it all
together in the meet,” Mike
Myers said.

Williams’ mm leaals Pitt
tofzﬁb place in Big East

By Matt Groff
Staff‘ Writer

Pitt runner Allison Williams proved yesterday that her
record—breaking performances are not confined to endanger-
ing the records of Pitt and regional invitationals.

Her time of 7.64 seconds in the 55-meter hurdles is official-
ly the fastest time in the country and shattered the meet
record at the Big East Championship this weekend in

Syracuse, N.Y.

“It was a maximum performance, absolutely outstanding,”
Pitt track Coach Steve Lewis said. “In order to take first, she
had to beat last year’s national champion.”

Williams, who was also part of a 4 x 400 relay (Kim Blair,
Williams, Monica Hockaday, Tanya Mullins) that took a third-
place finish, led the Pitt women’s indoor track team to fifth
place in the championship behind four “extremely good”
conference teams. Villanova edged Seton Hall for the cham-
pionship while Syracuse and Georgetown placed third and

fourth, respectively.

“Each of those teams was expected to be very good, and
they lived up to those expectations,” Lewis said. “In fact, the
Big East will probably qualify 20 competitors in nationals.”

Women’s
hoops splits
on Big East
road trip

By Jason Brame
Staff Writer

It was the best of times, it
was the worst of times —

The Pitt women’s basketball
team split a pair of Big East
games, losing to Boston
College 59-57 and defeating
Seton Hall 59-47 this weekend
as it ran its overall record run
to 13-10.

The Panthers rallied from a
10-point deficit to nearly defeat
the Boston College Eagles
before 859 spectators at a rau-
cous Silvo O. Conte Forum. Pitt
guard Erin Maloy’s three-point-
er with 1:14 trimmed the BC
lead to one, 58-57, but the
Panthers could do no more
damage.

Kerry Curran netted a foul
shot to end the scoring and
send the Panthers to their sev-
enth Big East defeat.

Pitt jumped out to a quick
seven-point lead against the
Eagles as jonna Huemrich, who
received game-high honors
with 20 points, hit a layup at
17:18 to give the Panthers 21
quick 7-0 lead and control of
the game.

BC, which stopped a nine-
game losing streak with the vic-
tory, quickly cut the advantage
to three.

Boston College then sliced it
to one point, "as Audrey
Bowersox’s six-footer made the
score 14-15 and sent Pitt to its
first timeout.

A Jill McElhinny layup gave
the Panthers a three-point edge
again, but Sarah Behn, who
matched Huemrich for game-
high honors, hit a three-pointer
to tie the game and give the
Eagles momentum that would
allow them to open up an
eventual five-point (32-27)
spread at the half.

McElhinny’s fourth foul sent
her to the bench and BC center
Marissa Mezzanotte to the line
for a pair of foul shots to open
the second period. Hitting them
both, Mezzanotte opened the
lead to seven and began a bas-
ket exchange between the
rivals.

The half saw no major runs
by either team until, with 6:36
remaining in the game, Pitt

Hockey club closes
season with 8-6 win

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

The Pitt Hockey Club closed out a disappointing
season on‘ Sunday with a much—needed victory over
WPCHA playoff-bound Penn State-West.

In a game completely dominated by special
teams, the Panthers were outgunned but not
outscored.

Despite being shorthanded 11 times (three times by
two men), while being outshot 47-35, the gritty
Panthers managed to defeat the Saints by the final
score of 8-6 on the strength of two short—handed
goals.

The victory gives the Panthers a final overall record
of 4-12-1 and a 3-8-1 mark in league play.

“We wanted this game real bad,” Hockey Club
President Mike Mahoney said. “We established the
physical game early on  we were taking the body a
lot during the game, and I think we played better
because of it.”

“It’s been a really tough season —they don’t get
much worse than this,” centerman Bill Crousey said.
“I’m just glad to see it end on a good note with us
playing a solid hockey game.”

Panther defenseman Scott Giordano led all scorers
with four points (one goal, three assists).

Other notables included defenseman Ken Fatur,
who collected his first hat trick as a Panther, and for-
ward Kip Linse, who added three assists.

The Panthers held a precarious 6-5 lead at the end
of two periods but would see that evaporate with a
little over nine minutes remaining in the game.

With Pitt shorthanded by two men, Penn
State’s Mark Nikoliason rifled aislapshot past
Panther goaltender Dan Bratkovich to tie the score at
six.

Just over 30 seconds later, however, with Penn State

still on a power play, Giordano took control of the

The team had to compete in
this meet without senior co-cap-
tain Kristin Brown competing
because of a bad case of the ﬂu.
Her absence cost the team about
three points. But teammate
Alisha Friend said the team can-
not make excuses.

“A gymnastics team is not
comprised of two or three peo-
ple doing everything them-
selves,” Friend said. “We have 12
people on this team, and every-
one needs to perform up to her
ability from week to week.
Ultimately, we are only as good
as our weakest link.”

The team opened the meet on
vault with a score of 44.30, well
below the score it is used to
obtaining. The scores were pro-
vided by Myers (8.8), Bethany
Toellner (8.05) and Heather

Halovanic (8.95). While only
competing in her second meet of
the year, Meg Johns earned her
career high with a 9.15. Friend
also obtained her career high
with a 935.

Bars, which is usually a
strength for Pitt, was the worst
event of the day for the team.
The team’s total score was a
mere 43.65. Shannon Brown,
who consistently scores above
9.0 on this apparatus, began with
a score of 8.70. Jorgensen did
register a season-high 8.95.

The scores slightly improved
on beam where the team tallied
a score of 44.90. Johns achieved
her season high with an 8.85.
Friend earned a career-high 9.40.
One of the stars of the day was
Myers, who exceeded the previ-
ous school record of 9.65 with a
score of 9.70. As her difficulty

improves she may someday
break her own record. The rest
of the scores were Daller (8.65),
Jorgensen (8.50) and Toellner
(8.30).

As expected, Pitt again fin-
ished strong on ﬂoor. Halovanic
(8.90) acquired her season high
and Johns attained her career
high with the same score.
Jorgensen earned a 9.05 and
Toellner, a 9.50. However, all the
attention was on Friend, who
was the second to last competi-
tor of the day.

Going into this event she had
accumulated an all-around score
of 28.50. Her perfomiance three
weeks ago placed her 10th on
the Pitt all-time list. Her convinc-
ing score of 9.70 helped to tie
for fifth on the all-time all-
around scoring list with a total of
38.0.

One of those competitors will
be Williams and Pitt may have a
future national-calibre athlete in
first-year student Najuma
Fletcher, another top contributor
for Pitt this season. She contin-
ued her strong first year with
four third—place finishes, the
highlight of which was her pen-
tathlon performance.

“The top four places broke
the meet record and Najuma’s
point total also broke the Pitt
record,” Lewis said.

F1etcher’s other third place-
ments were in the triple jump,

high jump and long jump.

“To be a freshman and go
into the Big East Championships
isn’t easy,” Lewis said. “I’m
pleasantly surprised that she is
so successful at this level.”

Another success for Pitt was
senior Monica ‘Hockaday who
placed sixth in the 500—meter in
addition to running to third
place with both the 4 x 400
relay team and the the 4 x 800
team (Hockaday, Judy Facey,
Ayne Allen and Tonia Malloy).

Blair, in addition to running
with the 4 x 400 team, added an
individual fourth—place finish in

the 400-meter run. Katina Miles
finished fifth in the pentathlon
and placed sixth in the
high jump. Joanne Warner’s
shot—put was good for sixth
place.

Lewis said he is looking for-
ward to ECACs and Nationals in
March, as well as the outdoor
track season.

“I think that our team is best
suited for outdoor competition,”
Lewis said. “I think we will
improve as a team and also
individually when our top
sprinter, Ronisc Crumpler,
comes back.”

spurring visiting UConn to a
commanding 47-32 halftime
bulge that would eventually
stand 81-80 at the final
buzzer.

Led completely by the trio
of Brian Fair (15 points),
Travis Knight (10 points)
and Nantambu Willingham
(eight points, six rebounds),
the UConn sidemen
outscored the little—used Pitt
bench, 33-6, and proved
quite capably that the
Huskies caniwin a big game
without stellar efforts from
foul-ridden star forwards
Scott Burrell and Donyell
Marshall.

“The bench came alive
tonight,” Calhoun said after
UConn’s fourth straight con-
ference win. “Willingham,
Fair and some of the
other kids really responded.
It was a tremendous ef-
fort.”

With Marshall and Burrell
confined to the pines late in
the first half, Fair, Knight

and Willingham ignited
UConn on a blazing 16-4
run, sending the homestand-
ing Panthers scurrying into
the Field House locker room
with a swirling headache —
while propelling the
Huskies to another Big East
road win.

In the first 20 minutes, the
UConn bench outscored
Pitt’s reserves, 20-4.

“You can’t give a team
like Connecticut that big of
a lead and expect to be able
to come back,” Pitt head
coach Paul Evans said, not-
ing the Huskies’ recent
surge in conference play. “A
lot of teams  that were
playing poor early
have turned it around
and are playing really well
now.

“It’s just when you hit
them [on your schedule], I
guess.”

Evans may have guessed
on Marshall and Burrell
shooting down the Panthers.

of Budman at 150 and first-
year man Pat Wiltanger at
heavyweight. Budman’s
expected opponent, highly-
ranked Troy Sunderland,
could not go because of a
banged up knee, so Budman
took a 4-1 decision over
Tony Bobulinski.

Budman (32-9-2) has
wrestled better and better as
the season has progressed
and could possibly earn the
top seed at the Eastern
Wrestling League
Tournament in a couple
weeks. He expressed slight
disappointment at not get-
ting a shot at Sunderland.

“I was looking forward to
wrestling him. I was kind of
excited to see how I’d do
against him,” Budman said.
“We walked out"of there
thinking we could have
done better — even though
we were in a lot of matches.
They’re pretty tough. There’s
no way around it.”

Penn State enjoyed only
two blowouts, coming at
118, where Shawn Nelson
scored an 18-3 technical fall
over Mike Moore, and at
158, where josh Robbins
posted a 14-3 major decision
over Joe Plouse. Other than
that, the Panthers kept
things interesting, including
first—year man Brett Gould
(142) taking 10th-ranked

Russ Hughes into overtime
before falling 4-2.

The most anticipated bout
of the evening came at 167,
where Sean Gibbs finally got
his rematch with second-
ranked Dave Hart. Last
March, the two met for the
EWL title, and Gibbs came
within seconds of pulling a
huge upset. Hart prevailed
in overtime.

This time the bout
remained scoreless for two
periods, until Hart scored an
escape and a takedown in
the third, winning a 4-0
decision. Gibbs said this was
a personal gauge that
showed him exactly what
needs to be done for nation-
als.

“I was right there, there’s
just a few things I have to
fix,” Gibbs said. “I feel I can
definitely make a run at the
title.”

Thursday night, Pitt throt-
tled the 21st-ranked
Mountaineers, taking eight
of 10 bouts. In three F.WL
dual meets prior to the Penn
State loss — big wins over
WVU, Clarion and
Edinboro—the Panthers
took 22 of 30 bouts.

Pitt jumped out to a big
lead in the first three match-
es. Moore continued his
dominant season, pinning
Shawn Graham just 2:36 into
the bout. At 126, John

Richey wore down Rich
Ginther taking command in
the third period for a 4-1
decision. JJ. Fasnacht (134)
followed with a 4-1 decision
of his own to make it 12-0
Pitt. In addition, Budman,
Plouse (158), Gibbs, Jeff
Kloiber (190) and Wiltanger
all scored decisions for Pitt.

Pitt moved to 4-2 in the
league, finishing strong with
three straight victories. The
difference has been doing
all the little things better, a
sign of maturity.

“You didn’t see guys
doing stupid things tonight,
just being real methodical,”
Kloiber said. “It’s maturity.
That’s what it is.”

“They’re believing in what
they’re doing,” Pitt Coach
Rande Stottlemyer said. “We
have not arrived. We’re
climbing the ladder. I said
from the beginning, this
team could challenge for the
EWL title, and this is a good
example of that.”

Pitt completes its dual-
meet season Tuesday night,
taking on Kent State at
Fitzgerald Field House. After
that, the Panthers travel to
Lock Haven for the EWL
Tournament on March 5.
Stottlemyer stressed the
wide-open nature that this
tournament will have.

“That’s what counts. That’s
the big one,” he said.

began to cut into a 10-point Eagle

advantage.

Jill Colabrese hit both ends of a one-
and-one and then hit a trey to cut the
lead to 53-48. Huemrich then went on a
run of her own, hitting a pair of free
throws and then consecutive jump shots
to cut the Eagle lead to only one with
2:02 in the game.

Angela Crowder’s laytip was matched
by Htiemricli’s 15-footer and Curran’s
three was matched by Maloy’s three to
make the game 58-57.

Curran scored 16 points for the
Eagles, who moved to 9-14, 6-6 within
the conference.

Besides Huemrich‘s 20, Turia Ransom

netted 15 points and pulled down seven
boards for Pitt. Colabrese had eight.

Walsh Gym in South Orange, N.].,
proved to be a much kinder arena for
the Panthers to showcase their skills as
they put an end to their one—game skid
and walked away with an impressive
victory over Seton Hall.

A respectable 41-percent shooting
average highlighted an evening that saw
Pitt knock down three of five three-
point attempts and 16 of 24 free throws
in one of its better shooting nights of
the season.

Colabrese had a huge evening, scor-
ing 16 points and pulling down four
boards to lead the Panthers. Hitting
seven of nine shots from the floor,

including both three-point attempts,
Colabrese set a personal season high in
scoring.

Pitt controlled virtually the whole
game, with leads as high as 12 points in
the first period and 14 in the second.

The first half began with a quick 12-4
Pitt advantage. McElliinny began the
scoring with a driving layup from
Maloy, which was quickly answered by
Texlin Quinney of Seton Hall, who
notched the score at two.

Pitt then went on a 12-2 run, which
was highlighted by five straight
Colabrese points. Huemrich also con-
tributed a pair of layups and a blocked
shot on Dawn Johnson to open up the
Panthers’ eight—point lead.

The Pirates fought back, however,
and cut the lead to only three on a
Shamona Marable layup with 9:20 left.
Pitt retaliated with another 12-4 run to
give the team a 10-point, 28-18, halftime
lead and a big momentum boost going
into the locker room at half time.

Scorching the floor with nine consec-
utive points, Seton Hall climbed back
into the ballgaine, outscoring Pitt 13-4
and climbing back in to within a basket,
30-32.

Pitt, as it did all night, answered with
a spurt of its own. Huemrich hit a pair
of foul shots, Maloy canned a three and
Huemrich hit two jumpers to extend
Pitt’s lead to nine and, for all purposes,
put the game away.
