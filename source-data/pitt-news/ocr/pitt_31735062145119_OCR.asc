“because Pitt was always where -he "

wanted to go.

 All ' the Way, through‘, Pitt‘ kept ,

playing, for a ‘fumble, guarding its

kicking deep into Carnegie’s territory,
‘playing defensively, and Sutherland,

In "the -.third quarter, Pitt’s- next
chancejcame, for Donahue, after Car-.

line, stood biehindihisi own goal and
kicked out of bounds on his own 18-

vvisufferied a 15-yard penalty -for holding 4

yards;-. On the‘ last down, with 16

it, but Johnny Kifer, ‘pressing his'_

‘hardest time of’t_h-e,ga,me,,for, it took

‘Brown broke. -right guard for two

into the game, Pitt -almost. scored
-again. Booth fumbled twice. on the
12-yard line and lost the ball each
time,‘ getting it the second time when
Donahue failed to-kick to‘ safety vvith,
a seven-yard punt; Booth,»_though,
gained as much ground as all of his
plunging . mates together, Red ‘-Mc-
Cutcheon, slopping around left end,-
made an 18-yard run that stood out as
the most. sensational in the game, but
the time was so; short that .it-amount-
ed to nothing. He followed it up by

'riv‘a1li_ng We-lch’s ‘forward passing ,

when he threw ,a‘short one, gaining
six yards, to Hoban. ‘A-minute later,
