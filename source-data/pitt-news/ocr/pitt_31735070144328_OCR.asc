When Pitt athletic director
Steve Pederson arrived on cam-
pus last December, no one was
sure what to expect. Football
ticket sales were down as Pitt ﬁn-
ished its third-straight losing sea-
son. The program, which hadn’t

earned a bowl bid in three years,
seemed like it was falling apart.

But only a few days later, Ped-
erson realized that he was stand-
ing over a sleeping giant. ‘He just
needed to wake it up.

State says cigarettes mustbe

by Jayson Myers
Staﬂ Wrder -

Students huddle outside Lo- 0

throp Hall, avoiding the cold and

taking in- one last cigarette before-

running off to class.

But these students might ﬁnd —

their breaks cut short, because a
new law requires some of them to
smoke new types of cigarettes.

_ A new law, which went into ef-
fect on New Year’s Day, stipulates
that state businesses can only sell
cigarettes if they’re “ﬁre-safe.” _

‘ To make cigarettes ﬁre-safe,
manufacturers place two to three
additional layers of paper in cer-
tain sections of the cigarettes,
making them thicker in some parts
than others. The‘cigarettes will go
out if people smoking them don’t
inhale frequently enough before

they burn down to the thicker por- .

tions. Thus, they self-extinguish.

l -- » » ‘:‘I.f;«you’ret not actively, smok-

ing the cigarette and it falls on the
couch or the bed or something, it
acts as a speed bump that will slow
down the burning,” said Lorraine
Carli, spokesperson for the Na-
tional Fire Protection Association,
which ‘created the‘ coalition that
lobbied for the ﬁre-safe cigarette
legislature.

(6

People understand that it's for ‘

their own safety. People have

been more accepting than not.

Paul i' 
i.Sundo

This “speed  effect,
could potentially help prevent

deaths caused by ﬁres. Accidental

. cigarette ﬁres,- said ;Carli~, are -the .«

leading cause of home ﬁre deaths.

Each year, cigarettes cause ﬁres '

that kill between 700.and 900 peo-
ple,_and that was the basis for the
law, said Carli.

Chelsea Bodamer, a Pitt student i

who has been smoking for the past
ﬁve years, said she understood the
importance of the legislation. ‘ I

“I think it’s a good idea," said
Bodamer, “but it’s ﬂawed in that

[the cigarettes] don’t stay litvery '

well.” .

. Bodamerisaid that, except for.
the fact that the cigarettes oc- _

casionally extinguish themselves,
there isn’t much of a_ difference
between the ﬁre-safe cigarettes
and their predecessors.
“If  I think it’s good
‘ for ﬁre safety in general,” said Bo-
damer. _ ; ' a
Paul S_undo, an assistant store

manager at Rite Aid, said the de- '

mand for cigarettes hasn’t changed

‘fire-safe‘

much since the ﬁre-safe ones be-
gan ﬁltering into the market.
“People understand that it’s

for their own safety,” said Sundo. I

“People have been more accepting

’ than not.”

Sundo said he heard a couple
of customers complain about the
cigarettes. But even those people
said they understood the ‘value of
the legislation, said Sundo. ,

“The hard-core smoker will say
that it burns‘ out too quickly, and
theyfll have to relight,” said Sun-
do. .

Cigarettes with the safety fea-
ture look almost identical to others
"cigarettes. P

Carli said people can see a dif-

ference if they run a highlighter -
M along the cigarette. The color will

ﬂuctuate where the paper is thick-

0. er. The letters “FSC,” which stand
for “fire safety compliant,” appear
- on the packages.- = .- - .- .

Students compete,

show off business skills

by Tamara Braunstein

Staﬂ l»l7/riter

Twelve teams from the Joseph M.
Katz Graduate School of Business
competed last semester in the McK-
insey Cup Playoffs, a competition that
judged their ability to apply learned
skills to corporate environments.

The ﬁve—member team of students,
Tom  Craig Romanek, ’Iien—I
“Grace” Shen and Gurpreet Ubhi,
won the competition, which was the
culmination of a classcalled “project
courses” They beat out‘ two otheri-i-
nalist groups for their project with di-
ent Ericsson Inc -

The group said in its presentation
thatitwas the ﬁrsttoworkwith the
Swedish Fortune 500 telecommunica-
tion company,  1,000 net-
works in 175 counties that process
about 40 percent of all mobile calls
The project focused on the 
possibilities of what the group calls

gquadplay services

Consumers would. deﬁne quadplay
as a bundle of Internet, home, cellular

and television services rolled into one
and received at equal or less cost than
when puithased individually

\With help from faculty advisers and
McKinsey & Co. consultants, the team
presented Encsson with problem ar-

eas and suggestions for improvement

Second place went to a team that
collaborated with American Eagie,
and a team that worked with Mine

. Safety won third place

V Other participating clients last se-
mester included Allegheny County,
Bayer, Federated Investors and West-

Several students said they chose to re-
turn to Pitt last Saturday to avoid paying
the extra toll fees. Others simply took a
different route.

But, for some students, the turnpike is
the only option.

“I don't really have a choice,” said soph-
omore Kade Boyle. “Being from Philly, I
have to take the turnpike to get here.”

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

Students return early to avoid tolls  

As the economy struggles, some agen-
cies have questioned why these rate chang-
es have come now.

In June 2007, the Pennsylvania leg-
islature passed Act 44 with the goal of
converting Route 80 into a toll road.
This would provide an inﬂation-sensitive
funding stream to address Pennsylvania's
transportation funding crisis. The annual
increase of 3 percent makes the tollfees
inﬂation-sensitive.

The Federal Highway Administration

rejected Act 44, which the state expected P

to generate $946 million. The tolls will
likely produce half of that.

PennDOT press secretary Rich Kirk-
patrick said the increased tolls pay for the
bonds that have been issued to construct
additional infrastructure, like highways and
bridges.

“The condition of some of the roads
is terrible,” said Kirkpatrick. “We need the

Research could affect
computer chips one day  

Research, page 1

Virginia professor John Yates; and Dan So-
rescu, of the National Energy Technology
Laboratory —- used a scanning tunneling rni—
croscope, which earned its inventors a Nobel
Prize in physics, to observe the arrangement
of dimethyldisulﬁde molecules on a gold sur-
face at a molecular level;

They noticed that the molecules rear-
ranged to form chains of up to 15 molecules.

(C

The very interesting question
is what people will do to fol-
low up on this.

Kenneth ’ ’
Jordan

The researchers experimented to see what
sort of reaction they could create by introduc-
ing an electron to the chain of molecules. By
adding voltage to the metal tip of the micro-
scope, the researchers created a negative or
positive charge at the tip that: repelled or at-
tracted an electron. . V ’

The electron, however, created a reaction
that the scientists hadn’t expected. First, it
broke apart the bond between the two sulfur
atoms within the molecule. Then, half of the
split molecule surprised the researchers by
moving to the next molecule in line and split-
ting it in the same way. This process continued
down the line of molecules and sustained it-
self through chains of up to 10 molecules.

In the end, the broken molecules formed
into a new chain of dimethyldisuliide.

Jordan, who did computer modeling to
help interpret the experiment, said the team
had believed that in a reaction like this, the en-
ergy would dissipate too quickly to continue.

“We think it’s very surprising,” said Jor-
dan.

Jordan said there were two reasons that the
molecules were able to sustain the reaction.
One is that sulfur atoms bond weakly with
other sulfur atoms, making it easy for the elec-
tron to break the bond. The other is that gold,
a stable element, does not easily react with the
environment around it.

Jordan said that if researchers continue to
experiment, they might be able to recreate the
reactions using different molecules and sur-
faces.

After more experimentation, he said, scien-
tists might one day be able to use the reactions
in information storage and in nanolit:hogra—

iph}; a process-which places microscopic pat‘-

 

terns on microchips. Before this could hap-
pen, though, scientists would have to learn
how to make the reactions efficient enough to
complete millions of cycles, said Jordan. V
The original team will not conduct more
experiments on the topic, but others will.
“The very interesting question is what peo-
ple will do to follow up on this,” said Jordan.

Apple's decision is music
to downloaders' ears

At the Macworld 2009 key-
note yesterday, Phil Schiller, Ap-
ple’s vice president of worldwide
product markedng, madean an-

_ nouncement that music aﬁciona-

dos had been waiting to hear for
close to a decade. Apple’s iTunes
service will offer customers the
option to purchase high-qual-
ity songs free of Digital Rights
Management software. Apple
recently reached an agreement
with Sony BMG, Warner Music,
Universal Music and EMI, which
allowed the move to take place.
The transition isn’t fully
complete — the full catalog of
iTunes songs won’t be available
for DRM—free download until
April. But with an initial offering

- of more than 8 million songs, it

should be enough to slake even
the most ravenous music-buyer’s
thirst for new songs. Additionally,
the DRM—stripping service costs
an extra 30 cents per song, bring-
ing the total to $1.29 a song.

Apple’s move will likely spell
the end of single-song DRM.
As the industry’s largest online
retailer, the iTunes service is to
music sales what the iPod .is to
the MP3 player market: a near-
ly untouchable and ubiquitous
presence with a huge market

advantage over the nearest com-
petitors.

For the most part, this looks
like a move in the right direction.
Offering DRM—free music is po-
tentially the only way to combat
the problem of illegal download-
ing and piracy. Apple’s solution
offers a third option: DRM-free
music at a slight price premium.

Unfortunately, the problem
is that most people don’t pirate

music to avoid DRM, but to’

avoid paying for music in the first
place. Few things are as attractive
as genuinely free and open infor-
mation, including music.

Most pirated music being

DRM—free is incidental, an added
bonus to people willing to take
the risk of dealing with a law-
suit from the record industries.
Instead of acting as a method
of  security, DRM was in
many ways just an annoyance to

people who were already willing

to obey the laws and buy their

music legally.
However, people will now
have less restrictions on the mu-

'sic they buy online, which might

be an attraction for people wary
of tempting the law. Now that
iTunes purchases will be com-
patible with music players other
than the iPod and iPhone, like

Microsoft’s Zune and Creative’s _»

ZEN players, users of. non-
Apple hardware could turn to

iTunes as their primary way to ,

buy music.
The other thing to consider is

‘Apple’s 30-cent surcharge on the

DRM—free music. Hopefully this
isn’t just a method for the com-
pany to increase its own proﬁts
or those of the record compa-
nies.

Given that concert attendance
and CD sales have been slipping
steadily for the past several years
-—- overall concert attendance fell
an estimated 19 percent in 2007,
according to Billboard Maga-

zine, and music CD sales fell 20 '

percent in the same period —
digital music sales are the only
proﬁtable portion of the music
industry. Those proﬁts should
be shared fairly with bands and
musicians, rather than swept up
by retailers and executives.

Apple’s move looks like a
good one and one that will bene-
fit the customers and company’s
business. Hopefully it will have a
positive impact on the struggling
music industry as well by expos-
ing listeners to more music and
allowing them to use that music
any way they please.

Cheney secretly the puppet master

   

by Molly ‘Green
Coplum/uiat

  

As President George W Bush’s
tenure as our commander in chief
comes to a close, there has been
much reflection in the media on his
role in politics throughout the past
eight years. Most notable of these
is a series of interviews with vari-
ous aids and advisers to the Bush
adrninistration compiled in the

Vanity Fair article “An Oral History

of the Bush White House.”

The article reveals many of the
inner workings of the Bush ad-
ministration that had been hidden
away from us, the normal, everyday
Americans. And quite the surprise,
many of these interviews go on to
suggest that Vice President Dick
Cheney might have actually been
pulling strings. Gasp.

Most adamant of all about the
evilness of Cheney was Lawrence
\X/ilkerson, chief of staff to Secre-
tary of State Colin Powell. Among
many other things, Wﬂkerson re-
fers to Cheney as “the most astute,
bureaucratic ‘entrepreneur I’ve ever
run into in my life,” and explained
that “Cheney knew exactly how

According to W/ilkerson, Cheney
“turns everything on its head and
he becomes the power. And he
does it through his network. This
is a guy who’s an absolute genius at
bureaucracy and an absolute genius
at not displaying his genius at bu-
reaucracy. He’s always quiet. So are
most of his minions ...” In a final

Gestapo. ,

Whﬂe scary, I’m afraid to say
that this isn’t even the half of it. I,
too, have some sources who were
very close to certain members of
the Bush administration — I’m not

going to name names, but let’s just

say I have many friends in the ani-
mal community (and yes, I am al-
luding to Barney, the Bush family’s
trusty Scottish terner).

I learned that Cheney was do-
ing much more than manipulating
Bush’s decision making, he was

actually manipulating all of Bush’s -

actions  using mind control.
Now our resident cowboy-

president didn’t get his reputation

as stubborn for nothing. I have it

on good authonty that he often

struggled against Cheney’s ironclad
clutch. In fact, many of the so-
called “Bushisms” he garbled out
so unintelligibly over the years were
actually veiled cries for help.

You may have noticed that

many of these blunders oc-

curred when Bush deviated from -

his scripted speeches (no doubt
penned by Cheney, probably in his
own blood). It’s not that Bush was
unable to form intelligent, coherent
sentences on his own, as the media
would have you believe (don’t think
Cheney hasn’t gotten to them, too).
Oh no. It was merely the desper-
ate attempts of a desperate man to
send a message to the American
people —— one far scarier than glob-
al warrning or the possible threats
to our national security.

The Associated Press recently

Bushisms actuallya tortured psyche's cries for help

Green, page 8
compiled a list of notable Bush-
isms, which I will now submit to
you, ladies and gentlemen, as evi-
dence that Bush was nothing more
than an  pawn in Cheney’s
corrupt master plan.

Exhibit A: Sept. 29, 2000 —

Bush hadn’t even been elected to!

the presidency yet, and already
‘Cheney had begun his reign of ter-
ror. During a speech in Saginaw,
Mich., Cheney had commanded
Bush, a lifelong friend! to aquatic
life everywhere, to ‘assure local
business owners that he would not
support the ‘dismantlement of en-
ergy-producing dams as a means to
protect threatened species of ﬁsh.
Cheneyisu conltroliover Bush was
not yet at full strength, however,
and he was able to let out what
might be his last sentence—length
original thought: “I know that the
'. being and ﬁsh can coexist

peacefully.” Cheney, who naturally '

hates ﬁsh, was not pleased.
Exhibit B: Oct. 4, 2001 —-— Ac-
‘cording to chief White House
counterterrorism Qdviser Richard
Clark, plans were already underway
to use Sept. 11 as a means to invade
Iraq. Bush attempted to warn the
public in a post-Sept. ll, back-to-
work speech: “There’s no doubt
in my mind, not onedoubt in my
mind, that we will fail.” Soon after,
he nearly died — suspiciously —
choking‘ on a pretzel.

  

t ep

Exhibit C: Aug. 5, 2004 — Bush

y t
<<opInions>>

  

spoke at the signingiceremony of‘
the ﬁscal—year 2005 Defense Ap-
propriation Act. Poor Bush had
already begun, like much of the
country, to question our over-
_seas military efforts (he admitted
as much to Charlie Gibson in his
farewell interview this year), but
Cheney’s will was too strong, and
Bush signed the bill into ‘law. He

. did, however, manage this warning:

“Our enemies are innovative and
resourceful, and so are we. They
never stop  about new
ways to harm our country and our
people,'and neither do we.”

; Exhibit D: Dec. 7, 2006 —
 that his pleas has fallen
on deaf ears in the United ‘States

' and that most Americans thought
he had all the intelligence of a Ken-
tucky fried chicken, Bush became

desperate enough to  his luck
with the Brits.’ Fearing yet another
“pretzel incident” and knowing

that all Britons love Shakespeare, ,

Bush attempted to convey his situ-
ation metaphorically.-

In a joint appearance with for-
mer Bntish Prime Minister Tony
Blair, "Bush suggestively men-
tioned, “Make no mistake about it,

I understand how tough it is, sir. I -

talk to families who die.” This was,
of course, a reference to his own
dying soul, which after more than
six years of presidency had been
probably been tormented beyond
repair.

 

  

Exhibit E: May 27, 2008 —

' Bush’s presidency was nearly over,

and let’s be real here, he was a beat-

enman (See: weight lossland per-

petual frown). Sadly, his Bushisms

were occurring at a less frequent
rate, a testament to his defeat.

, We might have thought Bush
had learned from his failure with
the Brits, but duringa speech in
Mesa, Ariz., he attempted to make w
one last metaphor, one last cry for
help to the American people who
had turned their backs on him so
icily with their Bush-bashing and
low approval ratings.

0 V Bush nearly outed Cheney when
he said,‘ “The fact that they pur-
chased the machine meant some-
body had to make the ' machine. -
And when somebody makes a ma-

. chine, it means there’s jobs at the
machine—making place.” Bush was
clearly being vague on purpose, lest

Cheney ﬁgure it out and “acciden-
tally” shoot him while “hunting.”
Don’t you see, he was the machine!
Cheney was the maker! And that
machine-making place? The White
House! Sadly, the American people
chalked  up as poor vocabulary
 and had a go_od laugh at the
president’s expense. ‘ - V ’

Poor Bush. We can only be
thankful that Cheney’s reign as
puppet master is nearly over.

Gramsci gives

by Larissa Gula i
Staﬂ Writer

\X/ith a genre of music that
no one can describe and a name
few can pronounce‘ on the first
try, Gramsci Melodic is making

' its mark on the Pittsburgh music
- scene.

Gramsci Melodic’s curious

name (pronounced “Grom—She”)

 
 

came from Italian socialist Antonio

“ Gramsci, according to the band’s

founder Martin Rubeo.

“I chose ‘Gramsci’ because of
my experiences as an undergradu-
ate student studying political theo-
ry at Bucknell. Apart from the ac-
tual philosophy behind his writing,
I was drawn to his personal story
of sacriﬁce and commitment. He
was arrested [because of] his po-

 

litical stance. He was committed

to an idea and was willing to essen-
tially give his life for that idea,” said
Rubeo. ‘ '

But the band’s name isn’t the
only unusual thing about this local
upstart. Gramsci. Melodic com-
bines retro psychedelic and new
wave electronica sounds with a
grungy, late—’90s touch to fall into
the genre of an art—pop rock band.

 

sb aweloid

Rubeo formed Gramsci ,Me-
lodic in 2006 by bringing together/a
group of very differentqmusicians.

Trained jazz percussionist and
drummer Sean Rayl joined Rubeo
in 2006, bringing a history of live
performances in a speed metal
band. He and‘ Rubeo became the
hosts of Gramsci Melodic’s audi-
tions. '

Through the muck of medioc-
rity, there’s reason for faith, because
“Doubt” really delivers This movie
is a screen adaptation of the Pulitzer
Prize—winning play by John Patrick
Shanley and leaves theaudience with
questions about morality, faith and
 certainty

The plot revolves around St. Ni-
colas, a Catholic school in the Bronx
that is plagued by the potential of a
molestation scandal. . V

Father Flynn, a new and ambi-

to shake up the school’s traditional

However, the school’s principal,

Sister Aloysius Beauvier, doubts not‘

only Flynn’s methods, but also his in-
tegrity. When her newest nun, Sister
James, comes with concerns about the
schools ﬁrst black student
special attention under somemurky
circumstances from Flynn, Beauvier
prepares to go up aggressively against
the priest.

The movie plays with shades of
gray so that the audience is left with
little more than a vague inclination to
decide its opihion on whether Flynn
committed the abuse. Just as he did
with the play, John Patrick Shanley
told only one person thelverdict on

 and Beauviefs mantra that,
“When you take a step to address a
wrongdoing, you are  a step
away from God, but in his service”
Adams really shines in this role.
Her wispy voice is perfect for the
innocent and bright-eyed nun who
becomes confused‘ in the middle
of a scandal. After her more recent

. cartoonish roles in movies like “En-

chanted,” it’s reﬁeshing to see Adams
take on such a complex role that
showcases her acting ability.

The cinematography is beautiful
and seems an intricate piecework of
shots that come together to make a
storyin shades of gray. It’s only 
that the movie itself seems to be awash
with blacks, grays and whites with the
uniforms and winter weather.

By  scenes, like the
nuns at dinner and the priests at dinner,
the movie quietly directs us to under-

4 and eat bloody steaks, the nuns drink

stand the drastic differences between
the standards for nuns and those for
priests While the priests drink beer

milk and eat plainer foods «

These scenes excellently present

nooks and crannies of the plot The

shutting of windows against the ele— '

ments is a  action that mir-

The attention to detail in this mov-
ie shows in these scenes and symbols,
which are woven into the story. These
only create more facets for the audi-
ence to consider when deciding its
opinion-on the problems presented.
“Doubt’ ’ is awellicrafted, thought-
provoking movie that makes the audi-

New MacBooks larger than
life,-1 or atleast 17 inches .

by Donald Campbell

Colunmidt

Apple announced recently that it is re-
turning to its former glory. Once "again,
Apple will offer a mammothly large, 17-
inch laptop for those of us who want to do
away with our desktops.

Although technically still portable and
able to be used on the topiof a lap, these
17-inch monstrosities are more aptly la-
beled a mobile desktop, .as they are too
large, hulking and heavy to carry as easily
as the 13-inch MacBook. '

Apple isn’t playing around, either. To
go with the sheer size and enormity of the

laptop, the new MacBook Pro 17-inchers

pack a signiﬁcant punch.

The new Core 2 Duo processors propel

the goliaths to processor speeds of 2.66‘

gHz. Adding $300 to the price tag will yield
a Core 2 Duo clocked at 2.93 gHz.

Memory is available staindardywith 4 gi-
gabytes. 7 y i ' ~

Those who wish to break the bank com-
pletely can boost it to 8 gigabytes.

The hard drives available in the new
MacBooks come in two forms: serial ATA
standard magnetic and mechanical drives,
or solid state.

By default, a new MacBook will come
with a respectable 320 gigabytes.

Unfortunately, 320 gigabytes is the
maximum capacity the laptop can be con-
ﬁgured to hold. Adding $50 increases the
rotational speed of the hard drive to 7200
RPM, and adding $900 gives a prospective
owner a solid state drive that can hold only
256 gigabytes: _

Looking at the machine from above is a
strange experience. Like many 17-inch lap-
tops, the new MacBook appears to have a

. tiny keyboard swimming in an unused sea

of case material. -

The material is signiﬁcantly more inter-
esting than the previous iteration of the
17-inch MacBook. H

That is, the case is more attractive now
that Apple made the switch to aluminum
cases. '

There is a heck of a lot more material
sitting around when you buythe 17-inch. It
is excellent to know that Apple made'your
new brick of a portal machine predomi-
nantly recyclable.

After giving the technical speciﬁcations,
it becomes time for a good review of the

 

machine. Or, more speciﬁcally, a good re-
view of the idea of the machine. The new
MacBook is, unfortunately, not yet avail-
able. However, pre—ordering is available on
the Apple Web site.

The new MacBook appears to be as at-
tractive and glossy as its smaller brethren,
which is always a good sign. It is also ex-
tremely powerful. V A

It would, therefore, make an excellent

replacement for a desktop. Thegsize of the _

machine, however, becomes problematic.

Apple had some interesting problems
with its previous iteration of the 17-inch
laptop, back in the dinosaur days of the
G4. '

A quick search of Google will reveal nu-
merous accounts of users‘ having relatively
new or at least lightly used 17-inch Pow-
erBook G4 monitors crack — sometimes
just a little bit, sometimes straight down the
middle. _

Slashdot also reported that the new 17-
inch MacBook will have a nonremovable
battery. - ' _ '

ff Knowing battery technology and most
users’ illustrious histories with laptop bat-
teries, this appears as a rather blatantly silly
idea. i 5 ‘ A

That is, it is a silly idea if you do not
recognize Apple’s chances of making quite
a bit of repair income on MacBook Pros
that do not maintain their ability to hold a
charge.

So what is the ﬁnal verdict? Apple.tends
to make excellent hardware. An Apple pre-
mium, although not always present in Ap-
ple products, does seem to be applicable to
the new MacBook Pro 17-inch, hbwever.

For a base. price of $2,799, I would
personally much rather buy a smaller Mac-
Book, accept a small downgrade in my por-
table computer performance and use the
difference in price to purcha_se a powerful
desktop or upgrade my existing desktop.

Part of this mentality stems from the‘
fact that I enjoy my laptop everywhere I go.
I also haveia family history of back prob-
lems.

Something tells me _these two facts

should not mix if I were to own a 17-inch 7

MacBook Pro. . A 1
For now, the MacBook Pro 17-inch
provides only entertainmentthrough surf-

ing of the Apple Web site advertising the

product.

It is quite fun to max out the Apple '
conﬁguration wizard and sit in astonished.

Gramsci mixes musicians to make unique sound

Gramsci, page 10

Tony \X/illoe, Gramsci Melodic’s bass
player, began playing music as a child and
discovered a talent for any instrument with
strings. They then picked up keyboardist
Gregory Haduch, who taught himself how
to play the piano/ keyboard without being
able to read the music As a teenager, he be-
gan to compose hip—hop beats for other art-
ists in his neighborhood.

Joel “The Duke” York arrived last from

England, and after influence from Rubeo he
began to ﬁnd he had an ear for synthesized
tones, digitized beats and quadraphonic ar-
peggios and began working synthesizers for
the band.

The mixture of Gramsci Melodic irn—
presses even Rubeo.

“I think you would be hard—pressed to
find a band with such different members in
terms of personality. I thinkit’s fair to say that

if we weren’t in a band together, we probably
wouldn’t be in the same social circles.”

But the differences among the band’s
members serve it well, according to Rubeo.

“I write all of the music and lyrics, but it
doesn’t really become a Gramsci song until
everyone adds his own touch,” he explained.
“Sometimes this involves subtle changes,
and other times it involves an overhaul of
the song. There is a respect that we have for

“The support [of the band] has been fan-
tastic and unexpected, especially since this
project was never meant to be much more
than me recording songs in my living room
to share with friends,” said Rubeo.

Gramsci Mel0dic’s support and dedica-
tion paid off this year when the group won
the 2008 Pittsburgh Rock Off, a play off

Rubeo 

judged by music industry professionals.

Still, the group faces the challenges pre-
sented by Pittsburgh’s music scene.

“There is not much of an emphasis put
on local music by the city,” said Rubeo. “On
one hand, that hurts a band [that] is trying
toimake a name for [itself]. However, it also

provides a gut check for the bands  and fos-
. ters a close band—fan relationship.”

Rubeo explained that the scene also en-
courages bands to work hard to set their own
terms on scene.

“I think too many people complain about
the scene without doing anything to change
it. Also, just because there is more coverage
given to local music in cities like Minneapolis
and Columbus doesn’t mean that any band
can achieve success by simply booking a
show at the local bar. Sure, there are things I
would like to see change about the local mu-
sic scene, but I would rather try to change
them than simply complain about them.”
