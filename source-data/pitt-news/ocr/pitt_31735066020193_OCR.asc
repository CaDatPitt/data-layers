U.S. will unveil new arms proposal in Geneva

WASHINGTON — Reagan ad-
ministration officials said that U.S.
arms negotiators will have a new
arms reduction proposal when they
meet with the Soviets in Geneva.

According to the officials, the presi-
dent has approved a measure that
would sharply reduce superpower
strategic nuclear weapons and with-
draw medium-range nuclear missles
from Europe;

The elimination of nuclear
weapons is ”the ultimate goal” said
the officials.

They also said, however, that what

. the United States wants to see in the

next 10 years is a ban on all ballistic

_ missiles.

The package puts some of the key
proposals that Reagan made to Mik-
hail Gorbachev in Iceland this month

A on the bargaining table.

Soviet arms shipments

pass last year's total

WASHINGTON —- The Pentagon

g reported that Soviet arms shipments

have already surpassed last year's
shipments.

Pentagon spokesman Robert Sims
said that the Soviet arms total is near-
ly 21,000 tons supplied so far this
yean

The Soviets have doubled the
Nicaraguan Sandinistas’ supply of
MI-24 helicopter gunships.

Missiles and other equipment were
also sent to Nicaragua by the Soviets.

The deliveries took place after Con-
gress approved aid to the rebels.

New bill benefits
disabled veterans

WASHINGTON — The president
signed a bill granting a 11/2 percent
cost-of-living increase for those
receiving disability payements.

The increase would benefit disa-
bled veterans and surviving families
of deceased veterans.

The bill also calls for improvements
in Veteran's Administration health-
care services, education and work re-
habilitation programs.

The bill takes effect Dec. 1. ‘

NEW YORK — The 1986 World

Champion New York Mets were

showered in a blizzard of ticker tape
and confetti in a victory parade.

The parade made its way through

the streets of lower Manhattan and _

Police barricades were knocked
over as the crowds of fans ﬂooded the
streets to celebrate.

An estimated 2.2 million people
witnessed the event, filling the win-

Negotiators prepare
new arms proposal

WASHINGTON — U.S. arms
negotiators will have a new arms
reduction proposal when they meet
with the Soviets in Geneva. Adminis-
tration officials said President Reagan
has approved a sweeping measure
that would sharply reduce superpow-
er strategic nuclear weapons and
withdraw medium-range nuclear mis-
siles from Europe.

Geneva the key proposals Reagan
made to Soviet leader Gorbachev in
Iceland earlier this month. A senior
White House official stated that he
’’would not quarrel” with the conten-
tion made by the Soviets that Presi-

dent Reagan had supported the idea

of banning all nuclear weapons in 10
years at the Iceland summit.

The offical, who is familiar with the
details of the Iceland talks, said that
Reagan ”may have said that at one
point” but also said that the presi-
dent's comments fell short of any

‘ ”formal agreement."

According to the official, what the
president was really seeking was a
ban on ballistic missiles.

Aviation authorities
confirm pilot's report

WASHINGTON — The Federal
Aviation Administration made pub-
lic a tape which confirms that the first
notice that air traffic controllers
received regarding last August's mid-
air disaster over a Los Angeles
suburb, was a pilot's report of smoke
rising from the area.

The smoke was from the wreckage
of a Mexican jetliner that had collid-
ed with a private plane.

The controller receiving the pilot's
report was distracted by a conversa-
tion with the pilot of another private
plane, which hadflown into the res-

tricted area without permission.

The FAA has recommended the
suspension of the second _pilot’s
license.

U n ited Way fund raising
cam pai gn in Towers Lobby

By Theresa Costello
For The Pitt News

United Way and the Resident Stu-
dents Association kicked off their

fund-raising campaign in the Towers

lobby on Monday.

The on-campus goal this year is set
at $200,000. As of Monday, more
than $175,000 hadalready been col-
lected. ‘

Sam Kaufman, director of RSA,
said, ”The main purpose of the cam-
paign is to not only raise money but
to make the students moreaware of
what different" organizations the
money goes to.” . , . ‘

Pitt football player Chuck~ScaIes is

also helping with the drive. .’’It is a

pleasure to be involved with the
United Way Agency," said Scales. ’’I
don't think most students really know
what the United Way represents.”

Pitt quarterback John Congemi,
who is also lending a hand to the
cause, feels that most students would
be surprised, as he was, at the num-
ber of things that the United Way
reaches.

”Chuck and I are here to help stu-
dents be aware of what the United
Way stands for,” said Congemi.

66

It is a pleasure to be
involved with the Unit-
ed Way Agency.  

_— Chuck Scales

In the Western Pennsylvania area

alone,’ 127 different agencies receive

funding. V

3 Some of the organizations that are
assisted‘by”these'funds are the Boy
Scouts of America, the American Red
Cross, YMCA and-YWCA, and the
Salvation Army. ' " '

Many Pitt students were helped by
one of the United Way's agencies
during the mine subsidence in the
Schenley Farms area last spring and

-never knew who was funding the
relief effort.

Pitt also receives grants from the
United Way for research in the health
fields and development in electrical
engineering. ’

”We do well by them, we do well
for them,_” said Sandy Klinzing, a-

coordinator for the campaign.

Last year over 70 percent of the
faculty and staff responded to the
fund-raising. This year President Pos-
var sent individual pledge cards to
each faculty and staff member. In
each department there is a represen-

«tative coordinator who will solicit

coHeagues
Last week United Way announced

that it was having trouble reaching its -

goal of $31.~million;- Only about two-
thirds of that amount hadvbeen col-
lected. Because ofthe largeinumber
of corporations leaving Pittsburgh,
the United Way has to turnto the

universitiesand theprivate sector for

more help. . , V

Federal funds to organizations such
as the United Way are cut with each
new budget, and more burden is
placed on the state and local level —
making this year's drive even more
important than in years past.

On Thursday at 4 p.m. in the Tow-

‘ ers lobby, there will be a closing

ceremony in which RSA representa-
tives will give the money raised to
United Way officials.

Donations will be accepted at any
time in the RSA office that can be
reached at 648-1124.

Nationality Rooms

festival is held

A Nationality Rooms festival
was held this past weekend in the

Commons Room of the Cathedral ‘

of Learning to celebrate their 60
years of international fame.

The festival was open to the
public and featured performances
by ethnic singers, dancers and
musicians. The colorfully dressed
groups and individuals repre-
sented Africa, Ireland, Finland,
Greece, the Ukraine, Poland and
many other countries. .

Displaysof artifacts were fea-

tured, and refreshments were
available so all could sample a bit
of ethnic food. ' ' ‘ “

Celebrity masters ofceremony
included Sally Wiggin, WTA_E-TV,
Don Riggs, WPXI-TV,‘ and Bill
Boring, WPTS-Radio.‘ I

The celebration attracted many
local residents, including Pitt
President Wesley Posvar, adorned

' " in his cowboy hatgivenv to him by

Roy Rogers. _. _ 

A More than 25,000 people'annu-
ally tour the 19 unique classrooms
in Pitt's Cathedral of Learning. Vi-
sitors have included heads of
state, queens and former Soviet

First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev.
According to E. Maxine Bruhns,
director of the Nationality Rooms,
”The rooms emphasize the histo-
ry, art and values of those
people.” ’

The 19 Nationality Rooms rep- ‘
resent Pittsburgh’s'diverse ethnic I

mix and are unequaled in the
world. ' -

' The rooms were the dream of Y ’

John G. Bowman, chancellor of -

the University of Pittsburgh from
1921 to 1945. In his plans for the

Cathedral, he hoped‘ to recognize A

and whose children and ‘grand-

Fundamentally,
they are wrong

On Monday, Oct. 27, The Pitt .News ran a column entitled ”Fun-
damentalists get away with too much.” The column dealt with a ver-

- A dict handed down by a Tennessee Federal Court. The court ruled

that a school district's curriculum that required the reading of what
a group of parents called ”anti-Christian” literature was violating the
students’ religious freedom. The ruling ordered schools to allow stu-
dents to opt out of classes they or their parents find objectionable.

it's not as if the objectionable material were even remotely porno-

graphic or threatening to society. The literature against which the par-

ents were protesting included Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of
Oz and other classic stories that discuss such movements as feminism,
humanism, pacifism and vegetarianism. One has to read far into this
material to recognize these movements. A picture in a 2nd—grade read-
ing book of a man making dinner for his family was interpreted by
the fundamentalists as undermining the structure of the nuclear family.

That Tennessee ruling has set a precedent, which is where the
danger lies. From now on, if a parent finds something his/her child
is studying in school to be objectionable, the parents can remove
their child from that particular class. This idea of ”if you don't like

._ it, leave’’ is undermining everything for which the system of public

education in this country stands. Unless children in grade and high
schools have the same curricula, how is society to keep tabs on how

' ' well the educational process is working? How are colleges supposed

to rate applicants if all of them have had radically different educations?

And lastly, another ruling in favor of the ”Christian activist” move-
ment is going to do nothing to halt their progress. These people have
had too many rulings in their favor already. The American people
have to do something to stop them now, or we're going to have to
live with their increasing influence for a long time to come.

If it isn't broken

‘T ,t b  Cl
Several questions came along with the announcement last week
that Pitt would not name a new director of student activities until

spring.
Vice President Kimbo said he has nearly 75 applicants for the po-

' sition, but he is in no hurry to fill it.

We wonder:

0 Is there already a candidate in the bag who cannot takeover un-
til spring? Perhaps Kimbo’s superiors have instructed him to keep it
under raps’. ,

0 Is there one outstanding candidate who by far surpasses the rest?

V Are they keeping him in the bag, waiting to see who else they can

draw? ~'
0 Is it possible that there are no competent candidates who have
applied for the job? .
0 Did they move back the deadline because acting directors Joyce
Giangarlo and Terry Milani are doing a fine job? ~
We think the final reason is most fitting. We hope that Kimbo and
his superiors feel the same. '
Giangarlo and Milani were put in a difficult situation. They had

the duties thrust upon them suddenly when former director Wm. An- A

drew Smith departed for Texas. Both have respondediwell.

The controversial dry rush went smoothly. Last week's bicenten-
nial celebration, including the opening at the'Syria Mosque and the
homecoming parade on Thursday, also went admirably.

Just a note to Kimbo — you cannot fix something if it is not broken.
The Office of Student Activities is in good hands.

needs to be solved by the residents.
of Tower C. This subject which we
are addressing is turning the 12th
floor lounge into a study lounge. We
realize that each and every lounge is
not owned by any house and they are
open to all Tower C residents, but
every house considers the lounge on
their elevator floor to be ”their
lounge,” so why change ours?

We feel that having a television in
the lounge is a privilege that we are
paying for and are entitled to. All of
the residents voted for or against this
study lounge, but the residents of the
floors other than 11, 12 or 13 are
apathetic to this decision. We're sure
that if this situation [were] reversed,
they would resist the change as much
as we are.

The reason behind getting a single
room in the first place is to avoid con-
flicting study times between room-

LETTERS

mates and to provide a permanent
and private study area. There are
several other places to study on cam-
pus if a student cannot do so in
his/her‘ room. If time and safety are
factors, the campus police are avail-
able to escort the students from any
area on campus.

Other factors that should be con-
sidered are that each house uses
”their lounge” for activities other
than watching television. Many edu-
cational and social programs take
place in the lounge. Also, we realize
that the lounges are run on a first
come, first serve policy, but we

would be quite reluctant to continue '

a television program when a group
of men came in and wanted to
change the channel.

In conclusion, the only thing that

we ask is that every resident in Tow-
er C consider each of our arguments
and try to vote as if they were trying

to save ”their lounge.”

’Date rape’ is a tragedy

They awakened the Bruce Hall
Resident Assistant at 4:14 a.m. and
dragged her over to the suite across
the hall. Sitting on the living room
sofa was a small, pretty girl with tears
streaming down her cheeks. She was
quivering as another older girl tried
to hug and console her. The RA had
never seen the sobbing girl before in
the dorm.

”What’s wrong?” the RA de-
manded.

This is the story the girl told her.

Her name was Amy, and she had

gone with some new friends to a’

fraternity party up on the hill. At one
of the houses she met a brother who
acted friendly and looked very cute.
They talked and danced for a few
hours; he consistently provided her
with beers at his insistence, even
though she had told him her toler-
ance was low.

Amy felt rather tipsy when he
offered to show her his room upstairs.
When they arrived, he shut the door
behind him, took her gently by the
shoulders and started kissing her.

. Amy started to plead, ”Please, no ..."

but he persisted, and the alcohol
surging through her h_ead made it
hard to resist in any physical way.

Before she could even realize what
exactly was happening, he was mov-
ing her towards the bed, kissing her,
unbuttoning her blouse 

Amy couldn't recall how she got
back to Bruce Hall, but she knew
now that she had never felt more mis-

MATT
TOLBERT

erable in her whole life — her self-
esteem was completely shattered.

Now one could argue that this
”date rape” incident was Amy's fault
as much as the brother's, perhaps
even more so. What makes what hap-
pened that night even more disturb-
ing is the fact that Amy was not a Pitt
student but a young high school
freshman visiting her older sister that
weekend.

Fortunately, this story is fiction. Un-
fortunately, there are too many tales
like it circulating among Pitt's and
other colleges’ Greeks to think them
all mere fiction.

The consequences of any such sto-
ry being proved true would be devas-
tating for everyone affiliated with this
university.

If Amy had gone to court and in-
sisted the encounter was rape, not
only would that ”<:ute” fraternity
brother find himself facing a possible
long-term prison sentence and a
hostile general public, he would also
be dragging his fraternity, his frater-
nity’s national chapter and Pitt's en-
tire Greek community through a very
deep and rank pit of legal and image-
tarnishing mud. The University of
Pittsburgh in the eyes of the media

would be the ”Home of Children
Molesters,” which won't help the rest
of us trying to get a job from the cam-
pus with ”bad character.”

Even if the brother is not found
guilty, that lad will face the scorn of
his family, his friends and anyone
who reads the newspapers or
watches the evening news. His
chances of getting a great job are
devastated. He will be haunted by
the event for the rest of his life.

All this mess, just because he
couldn't control his hormones.

A date-rape incident can be avoid-
ed. If a male Greek has an attitude
that all women are merely sexual out—_
lets, he's got a severe attitude
problem. And if a fellow brother
doesn-’t have enough sense to ques-
tion or prevent another brother from
taking another Amy up to his room,
l wonder what kind of brother he
really is, let alone what kind of frater-
nity the two belong to.

Pitt's Greeks have class, and most
act in a rather civil manner when in
the presence of women. And when
a pair head for the bedroom, it is
usually by mutual consent.

But if a guy has to stoop as low as
to inundate a girl with alcohol to get

' her in bed, I hope he understands that

the road of short-term pleasures he's
traveling will eventually lead to se-
vere long-term problems for himself,
his brothers and his university.

For the sake of all the Amys in the
world, let's be gentlemen out there.

THE PITT ISIEWS, Wednesday, October‘ 29, I986

Sweet scents bring back fond memories

When Rosemary Peters, a 53-year-
old registered nurse, saw an item in
the news recently, she thought her
heart was going to stop.

The news item was seemingly sim-
ple. It said that the Warner-Lambert
Co. was going to bring back three of
its old-fashioned chewing gum
brands: Clove, Beemans and Black
Jack. The three flavors would be rein-
troduced for a th ree—month test peri-
od to see if anyone still might be
interested in buying them.

Rosemary Peters stared at the sto-
ry, and her mind drifted back to the
year 1949.

"It was my junior year of high

.school," she said. "I went to a small

school in Pittsburgh. That was the
year I met Charlie. I guess first love
is always the same. I remember the
Latin teacher making a crack in class
— something about 'Leave Charlie
alone, and pay _attention to your
schoolwork.’

"Charlie and I went out a lot. He
chewed Beemans gum and he

‘ smoked. Smoking was considered a

sophisticated thing for guys to do
back then. I didn't smoke, myself. We
would go to all of the passion pits —
the drive-in movies and the places to
park. We did a lot of necking, but we
always stopped at a certain point.

"Charlie wanted to get married
when we got out of high school, but
I had enrolled in nursing school, and
my family thought it was important
that I should get my nursing degree
before I married anyone. Charlie
went off to the Marines, and when he
came back he still wanted to get mar-
ried. But I was still in nursing school,
and I still wanted to wait. I didn't
want to hurt my parents. We were
more obedient back then.

"So Charlie and I drifted apart. We
both ended up getting married to
different people. I had a bad marriage
which ended in divorce. I thought
about Charlie all the time.

”And the funny thing is  for years
the combined smell of cigarette
smoke and Beemans gum made my
knees weak. Those two smells were
Charlie to me. When I would smell

 

 

BOB GEENE

the Beemans and the cigarette
smoke, I could feel the butterflies
dancing all over my stomach.

"I guess the smell of things can re-
mind you vividly of the people you
associate with those smells. My
grandmother, for example — she was
Yardley's English Lavender perfume
and Dentyne gum. And my mother
was Ponds cold cream. Charlie,

 

J I

though  the most intense memory
was of Charlie. I would remember his

' warm breath and the smell of Bee-

mans and cigarettes.

“In 1976 my high school class of
'51 had scheduled its 25th reunion
back in Pittsburgh. I was so looking
forward to seeing Charlie. I didn't
have any illusions about rekindling
the romance after all those years, but
I did think that seeing him would
bring back a part of me that was once
filled with hope and joy.

”I got to the reunion, and I very
casually asked someone if Charlie
was there. The person said that
Charlie had died three months be-
fore. A heart attack. He had even
been apart of the reunion planning
committee, but he had died before
the reunion took place.

’’I noticed something around the
mid-'70s, too’. I never saw Beemans
gum anymore. It turned out that they
had discontinued the brand. When I
looked for’it, it wasn't available. I
thought to myself, ‘My goodness,
that's gone, too. What's left?’ "

Which is why the news item about

the reintroduction of the three chew-~ " 4‘

ing gum brands had such a jarring ef-

fect on Rosemary Peters. Cloveand.
Black Jack aren't just curiosities" to‘
her; she remembers them, and they " .
are little bits of nostalgia. But the fact [i 
that Beemans will be available for ~
sale again has made her giddy in ‘a. I 
way that she couldn't have predicted. I

"As soon as I heard about it, I

thought back to the long walks that . 
Charlie and I would take in the late ‘

'40s and early '50s_. I thought backto
the smell of that gum and those

cigarettes mixed on Charlie's breath.” V I
She said that she planned to be first

in line to buy the Beemans when it;

became available again in her drug- ,

store or grocery store. , .

’'I still don't smoke,” she said.’“But
I plan to put a stick of Beemans in my
mouth and go to a restaurant all by

myself and sit next to a table where ,
people are smoking. I'll chew the
gum and I'll close my eyes and I'll I

smell the smoke, and maybe it will
take me back to where I used to be.’

”I can't wait. I can't wait to feel the "

butterflies again."

This minister really turns the other cheek

Q. My heartthrob is a minister. I

am a widow in his church, and he,

always asks me to sit with him at din-
ners (he has been divorced a while),
and he goes out of his way to be with
me. But he has never asked for a

date. Finally I asked him home for-
dinner, and he was so pleased, and-

he showed it. He brought flowers
and later dropped by unexpectedly
with a houseplant. But never a kiss!
Not even a peck. Is he showing
respect for my bereavement, after
two years? Why is he acting that
way? And what is my move?

A. I can only guess why he acts that
way, but if he goes out of his way to
be with you and singles you out in
front of other people, you have_ to
find out what he has in mind. You
have to take a risk, and in this case
the risk is special, because if he
doesn't respond when you kiss him,
you are still going to be in church on
Sunday, right?

You have to face that before you
do anything. And he has to know that
whatever happens, you are going to
be a good parishioner. That may be
what he wants — a favored parish-

-ioner, who sits with him and keeps

all the other women off him.
On the other hand, he just may be

holding back for no better reason
than that he thinks the next move is
up to you. He's brought flowers,
plants, he lets people know he favors

you — so why are you holding back?-

He may be thinking that. Write and
tell me what happens.

Q. I think you were insensitive in
condemning cosmetic surgery in
your answer to the young girl who
was worried about the appearance of
her breasts. For many people, the
chance to alter some physical attrib-
ute that is giving them, whether you
approve or not, a damagingly poor
self—image, is a miracle; and it is an
increasingly safe and sure one per-
formed by skilled medical people
who are especially attentive to the
psychological aspects of the therapy.

A. I have some old-fashioned ideas, ‘

and one of them is not to alter the
body God has given us without seri-
ous reasons. OK, modern cosmetic
surgery is marvelous work and can
improve the entire outlook of some-
one who has fixated on something in
his or her own appearance. I certainly
do not condemn something that real-
ly helps people, and I wouldn't re-
strict cosmetic surgery to people who
are badly scarred by burns or other
major injuries. '

  

 

 DR
WESIHEIMER

If a client tells me in my office that
she is going to have a face-lift, and
I see she is determined, has her heart
set on it, has considered it and has
been given careful advice about it, I
wish her well.’ It is her choice. But to
a young person, still developing
physically and not yet mature in
mind or character either, I may give
other advice if my advice is sought.

The girl who asked me about cos-
metic surgery for her breasts had the
impression that they were unequal in
size — she never said how unequal

Apartheid is wrong,but wil

This is the time of year when high
school students take off a day or two
so they can ‘look at colleges. You
might see a few of them walking
around campus. They'll see the Tow-
ers. They'll see the Cathedral and the
small building next to it. That small
building is a cabin which represents
Pitt 200 years ago. The high school-
ers will see the student union, which
also has a small building next to it.
They'll probably wonder why that
building is there, as do may Pitt stu-
dents and passers—by. This building
is an anti-apartheid shanty. It
represents a student activist sentiment
popular at Berkeley 20 years ago. It
also represents some deep concern
about the oppressive apartheid
government in South Africa.

The apartheid regime is one that
gets a lot of press coverage. Most
people have an opinion about South
Africa and divestment and all of the
rest. Most people also don't know the
facts on the topic about which they
speak. Some ask, "Wel|, have you
been there?” I certainly would have
to say an emphatic ”no.” Because I
wanted to be better informed, and
out of pure curiosity, I found some
people who had been in South Afri-
ca. One was a black student who isn't

even allowed to go back there even
if he wanted to. The other was a
white, retired industrialist who ran
two plants in Durbin, South Africa.
I was amazed at the tale these two
men wove.

What amazed me most was that
these men were equally concerned
about the injustice practiced in South
Africa, and neither contradicted the
other. Except in one area. The student

said that divestment was the only ‘

way he knew of to get out of South
Africa. The retiree said that education
and development of a government
run by the black majority was the
only way to alleviate the problems in
South Africa.

I was wondering what was wrong
with divestment. It seems that we've
been told that divestment is the only
way out. "After all, don't we indirect-
ly support apartheid by having our
funds there? The answer is yes, but
we're also supporting the blacks who
live there.‘ It's a toughdecision, but
after researching the topic, I conclud-
ed that economic pressure won't help
the people for whom the shanty
dwellers fight.

Before you claim that I am a racist,
please read on, because this was all
new to me only a short while ago.

The American-companies in South
Arica are the only ones who do not
practice segregation in rest rooms,
cafeterias, pay scales, hiring, training
and promotion practices. It is the
American companies who follow the
principles developed by Rev. Leon
Sullivan, a black minister from
Philadelphia. ,

So, if American companies are so
good, then why are General Motors,

— and that this would spoil her love
life in the future, or make her uncer-
tain in dealing with boys and men
when she got to that stage in life. I
could not encourage her to go
straight to surgery in order to correct
a negative image she has of her own
appearance — possibly a wrong one.

At that stage of her development,
I suggest to a girl that she emphasize
other things. Let her think about all
the attractive "people she knows, and
ask herself whether such minor differ-
ences in two sides of a face, or a
chest, really make or break a prepos-
sessing personality. She is too young
to begin thinking that by changing
her face or body to look like some
ideal, possibly a very misconceived
ideal, she may affect people around
her.

I would much rather have her de-
velop those good relationships with
other people that are appropriate to
her age, to discover how well she can
like and be liked and share life with
other people, and not to get into
thinking that making one breast big-
ger or smaller, or having her behind
reshaped, is the way to deal with life.

A friend tells me how his cousin
had very heavy breasts. She was
chronically depressed by her appear-

IBM, Warner Communication, Coca-

, Cola and Xerox all pulling out? I hate

to say it, but it's not in opposition to
apartheid. It's for the same reason
they came in the first place —— profit.
They're getting heat from their stock-
holders, and their profits are down.
And sure, they claim that they'll sell
their operations to local interests.
There are very few South Africans
who have the funds toebuy into these
firms. What will happen is that com-
panies from other countries will buy
in and have racist labor practices.
Economic pressure isn't the an-
swer. If students were really serious
about pressuring the administration
economically, they'd boycott registra-
tion for next semester. The eyes of the
board of trustees would surely open
if there were no students. But that
won't happen, just as economic pres-
sure won't make things happen.
Just look what our good,
government-imposed sanctions have
done. South African airlines continue
to fly in and out of New York every-
day, even though Congress deprived
them of their landing privileges. By
divesting what BAS Administrative
Assistant Donald P. Frazier calls "em-
barrassing financial holdings in South
Africa," we'll be freeing the op-

ance, and breast reduction made her
life better. Well, if she was mature"

and had that problem combining
physical and emotional difficulties —
all right, I believe in that happy end-
ing — though I have known some
popular and happy women whose
heavy bosoms were definitely part of
their total images. . .
But each case has its own merits.
If the girl who wrote to me finds, in
four or five years, that there islsuch
a disparity between her mature
breasts that she knows people are dis-
turbed, even those who really like
her, [and] if an emotional problem
about that persists, it is a different sto-

pressed from their chains by cutting
off their hands. Having U.S.' firms
leave only limits any political lever-
age the United States has to organize
a black governing body.

This issue is one of the most
difficult facing us. One shanty
dweller said that he was spending his I
time there because he happened to
be in Pittsburgh, so he'd fight .where
he was. Attacking the university will
do nothing. Why not take mute ef-

forts and develop them into produc- .

tive ones? I realize that divestment is
an easy bandwagon to jump on, but
nothing good will come of it. Starv-
ing those we want to help by taking
away what little they have will only
strengthen apartheid.

There is no cure-all method to
abolish apartheid. What I do know
is that if everyone took the time out
to become truly familiar with the
South African issue, we'd be able to
make an effort that would ‘work,
without hurting those for whom we
fight. ‘There are no ends that the
means of economic pressure will
reach, save the pain of the black wor-
ker. Apartheid is wrong. So is our cur-
rent policy to abolish it. My hat goes
off to the shanty-dwellers. I hope that
the answer is near.

Pitt and Penn State have another
score to settle. This one has nothing
to do with football. This one is for
blood.

The Central Blood Bank will be

3 kicking off it's fourth annual Pitt—Penn
State blood challenge on Monday,
Nov. 3. For the past two years, Penn
,_ State has won the challenge. But, ac-
cording to public relations director,

' Marge Brown, all that can change.

”We really need students to get out
, and show their support for Pitt,”
Brown said. ”They have to accept
their responsibility to give blood.”
Everyone who donates blood at
one of the mobile blood units or at
one of the fixed sites between Nov.
3 and Nov. 19 can log a vote for their
favorite school.

”We’ve had a hard time in this area
_. because there are so many Penn State

alumni,” said Brown. ”They all give
blood in this area and then vote for
Penn State.”

As an incentive,'each student giv-
ing blood atone of the on-campus lo-
cations will receive a free hospital
scrub shirt with the Central Blood
Banklogo. ‘

”The hardest thing is to get people
to give for the first time,” Brown said.
”Everyone' puts it off ‘until next week’
and then never gives. This challenge
gives them the incentive.”

The need for blood in Pittsburgh is 1

about twice the national average,
Brown reported.

The Central Blood Bank serves 32
area hospitals and needs to collect an
average of 500 units of blood each
day to keep pace with the demand.

”The huge need for blood in Pitts-
burgh is mainly due to the trauma
centers,” Brown said. ”Trauma cases
are the biggest users of blood.”

problems in Pittsburgh is that there
is a shrinking donor base while there
is an increasing number of older peo-
ple. The blood bank sponsors blood
drives with more than 3,000 organi-
zations in the area.

The Pitt—Penn State Blood Chal-
lenge has increased the donations
considerably in the last three years,
with a total of 30,079 units donated
in that time. Last year's total was
12,667.

”About .15 percent of our blood-

comes from high school and college
students,” Brown said.

The drive, with honorary chairmen
Mike Gottfreid and Joe Paterno, will
begin in the Kurtzman Room of the
William Pitt Union at 11 a.m. on
Monday. The’Pitt football team will
be on hand to start the challenge.

All students"are encouraged to par-

Jazz greats to play

By Daphne‘ A." LaPointe
For The Pitt\News ’

Occasionally, one meets some-
one who really loves his work.
Nathan Davis is such a person.
But perhaps work is an inap-
propriate word to'use. '

The word work often implies an
unpleasant task. Nathan certainly
doesn't consider his work un-
pleasant. _ ~

This multiitalented musician
has been at Pitt since 1969, bring-
ing with him both national and in-
ternational honors from some of
the most prestigious colleges,
symphonies, festivals and literary
publications. A

As a full professor and the direc-
tor of the jazz studies department,
Davis teaches a range of under-
graduate and graduate courses, his
most popular of which is Jazz His-
tory. in this course, Davis whets
the appetite of young jazz en-
thusiasts and’ even wins over a
skeptic or two. I

As busy as his academic sched-

ule keeps him, the accomplished
saxophonist still manages to keep
his performing skills sharp by en-
gaging in several concerts -and
tours each year. (Presently, Davis
is with the Paris Reunion Band, a
recently organized group model-
led after Art Blakey’s legendary
Jazz Messengers.)

Not only does Nathan perform
in these concerts, he organizes
them as well, including the Annu-

3 in accordance with "university ef-
forts to upgrade security for the Pitt
campus community, Student Govern-

‘ ment Board member Rob Ardizzi is

hoping to implement a student escort

‘ service in the near future.

Although the campus police have
always obliged any student who re-
quested their accompaniment be-
cause they may have felt threatened,
Ardizzi said an additional service run

by students would help ease anxie-

ties caused by the surge of violence
last month.

According to Ardizzi’s plan, stu-
dents could call the service if they felt
walking to a location might put them
in a threatening situation. The calls
would be taken by students in a
center on campus, possibly a room

in the student union, who would

respond by escorting them.

A couple of details remain un-
decided though, such as whether all
escorts should be males and the
hours the center would operate. Al-
dizzi said he feels it is necessary to
keep improving campus security con-
ditions.

’’I was pleased to see that Pitt ap-
proved extended shuttle hours,”
Ardizzi said. The shuttle now runs
from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. on Friday and
Saturday. The shuttle is driven by a
Pitt security guard, and the advan-
tage, according to Ardizzi, is the bus’
direct line from the hill to the lower

campus.

’’I live in a fraternity house and
seemed to be hearing too many sto-
ries of assault and trouble around
campus," Ardizzi said. ”That’s when
I decided another system was

needed.”

Computer stolen from Kinko's Copies

By Liz Habib

Sta ff Writer -

Sunday night at about midnight,
a Macintosh Plus computer and
an external drive unit were stolen
by two black males from Kinko's
Copy Center at 3945 Forbes Ave.
The computer hardware is valued
at $4,000, according to store
manager Cheryl Steffy.

’’It was a set-up,” said Steffy. ’’It
was planned; the guys knew what
they were doing. _

”One guy came in and asked to
use the computer,” she said. ”The
employee working at the time
gave him the software.”

There is no designated route after
9:30. .
According to CMU student senator
Peterr Cohen, the service has been
very effective. ”A lot of our students
use the service because they live in
the surrounding neighborhoods, and

Steffy said when the shift
changed and Glen Cunnigham
came on duty, he noticed two
men sitting at two different termi-
nals. The counter started getting
busy, according to Steffy, and af-
ter noticing one of the men leave
without paying for computer time,
Cunnigham pursued him.

While Cunningham was occu-
pied with-the first man, the second
allegedly left with the computer
equipment.

Police reports describe one of
the men as approximately 30
years old, wearing a dark blue
jacket, blue jeans and a gray hat.
He weighs approximately 200
pounds. -

few years.

”Money might enter into the. pic-
ture,” said Ardizzi. ”Last year when
people wanted the campus bus [oper-
ated by a non-university company] to
extend its hours, Pitt officials said that
_it_would cost too much money.”

Steffy estimated the stolen com-
puter will cost the business about
$50 per day and that she is not
sure how soon it will be replaced.

According to Steffy, a woman's
wallet was stolen last week. Steffy
said two men asked the, woman
for help with a copy machine, and
when she bent over to assist them,
the men took her wallet from her
purse and fled.

Steffy also believes the thieves
are not students but are familiar
with the area and the store. She
said the business is considering
purchasing five more computers
but will not do so until the secu-
rity problem is rectified.

, GRAFFITI .4’

The system Ardizzi plans has not
been used at Pitt, but a similar plan
is being utilizedat Carnegie Mellon
University. '

CMU provides a vehicular student
escort service under the supervision
of the campus police. A professional
driver circulates the hub of the cam-
pus every half hour of the day, while
work-study students take over the
shuttle from 9:30 p.m. to 3:30 a.m.

it seems to be a success,” Cohen said.
”We had some problems a year or
so ago with some work-study stu-
dents not showing up, but that's been
resolved.”

Ardizzi said he is considering
work-study as a possible incentive to
get students to become escorts. The
only problem he foresees is that Pitt
has been cutting back on the num-
ber of work-study programs in the last

gum EM. »€2iFFlTl-l-

Ardizzi said he hopes a work-study
program is adopted, but if money
does become a factor, he will enter-
tain the possibility of a volunteer-
based program.

The campus police are apt to ap-
prove of Ardizzi’s proposed system,
though not without reservations.

’’It would be a good plan insofar
as it doesn't get abused,” said a Pitt
campus policeman, who asked to re-

main anonymous. ”As long as the
complaints are legitimate, it should
work.”

The officer also said he questioned
the use of students as escorts.

’’I’m a little leery of students escort-
ing other students,” he said. ”l would
suggest a background check to be run
on all participants."

The seven-year veteran of the cam-
pus force pointed out that the cam-
pus police are doing their best to
respond to all requests about escort-
ing students, but he admitted that
manpower is not always as plentiful‘
as they would like.

”lf we get backed up in the even-
ing, the escort calls are not always a
priority,” he said. ”But we eventual-
ly get to them.”

Before Ardizzi’s proposal is submit-

ted, he must attain data from schools ’

belonging to the Urban 13 League,
of which Pitt is a member. The 13
universities formed the league be-
cause of their similarities in urban lo-
cation and enrollment. Ardizzi must
find out which, if any, of these

3 schools has a student escort service.

Ardizzi has sent questionnaires to
all 12 schools asking for information
concerning the percentage of stu-
dents who use the service, the specif-
ic type of service offered and how
they rate the effectiveness of their
respective programs. .

Once he receives feedback from
these schools, Ardizzi can send his
proposal to the Student Affairs Office
before submission to the adminis-
tration._ -

As a result of the unusually large
number of robberies and assaults on
the weekend of Sept. 19, police pro-
tection in Oakland has increased.

Hoping to prevent any reoccur-
rence of the events of that weekend,
the University of Pittsburgh Police
have added more officers to the night
shift.

Twenty-three arrests were/made in
Oakland on Friday night. Three peo-
ple were arrested for one assault, and
the 20 others were arrested for intox-
ication and disorderly conduct. There
have not been any robberies report-
ed to the campus police since the
third weekend in September.

’’It is not a major problem around

' here; it is minor problem. With the
increased police presence, they [the
robberies and assaults] have
decreased,” said Gary Moses, assis-
tant director for Field Services.

”There are more robberies than as-
saults. Most of the robberies are purse
snatchings and gold chains being
ripped of,” said Moses.

There are more rob-
beries than assaults.
Most of the robberies
are purse snatchings
and gold chains being

ripped off.
— Gary Moses

These crimes are more prevalent in

‘ South Oakland than in North Oak-

land. A lot of the robberies occur
around the areas of McGee—Womens
Hospital and Carlow College. ’
. Even though these crimes are more
prevalent in South Oakland, the num-
ber of these incidents that occur in
Oakland's business district is low.
Most of the arrests made in the busi-
ness district are the results of brawls.

”The number rises as the bars let
out,” said Moses.

Police said 85 percent of the rob-
beries and assaults were committed

lytical background while focusing on
aspects of organizations in the health
field, according to Pitt's health ad-
ministration program.

Traditionally, the program was ex-
clusively in the Graduate School of
Public Health, according to Beaufort
B. Longest, junior director of the
health administration program. Now,
about half of the courses will be in
the School of Public Health and the
other half in the business school.

”The program office is physically
in this school (Graduate School of
Public Health), but students should
think of it as a joint effort between
the two schools,” Longest said.

The objective ofthe M.H.A pro-
gram is to provide a master's-level
education to students with enduring
and transferable abilities and skills to
allow entry into the health manage-
ment sector. Advancement into

' senior management positions may

follow with appropriate experience,
according to the health administra-
tion program.

”The new M.H.A. degree will pre-
pare managers in the health sector
"who are well grounded in the
management disciplines and who un-
derstand the unique characteristics of
health and medical care delivery,"
Longest said.

The program also offers aid in the

 

Police protection to increase.
because of Oakland violence

by juveniles 14-18 years old.
Seventy-five percent of the juveniles
who commit the crimes are black
males, according to Moses. '

in addition to the increase of
uniformed campus police on the
streets, the number of plain-clothed

police officers has been increased

from two to four.

”We make more arrests because
we can see them, but they can't see
[us]," said Sergeant Dominick Pizo-
li, a plain-clothed policeman.

These officers can cover any area
in Oakland they feel is necessary. The
majority of thecrimes they see are car
thefts.

’’I feel much more protected see-
ing a lot of police patrolling Forbes
Avenue,” said Celeste Elash, a Pitt
sophomore.

Even though there is increased

police protection, students still need ‘

to be careful at night.

”Don’t walk alone, walk with
someone else, and stay on a lit street.
if you wear chains, keep them under-
neath your blouse. Carrying a whis-
tle is a good idea,” advises Moses.
”And don't struggle.”

New health manager degree

placement of its graduates. Graduates
assume management positions in
hospitals and multi-unit systems,
health maintenance organizations,
health affairs divisions of corpora-
tions, consulting firms and other or-
ganizations.

In addition to these positions,
graduates could apply for administra-
tive fellowships and -advanced

- residencies.

The M.H.A has a two year curric-
ulum. The summer between the two
academic years is spent in a manage-
ment residency.

Prospective M.H.A. students will
be drawn from those-”who under-
stand that health care institutions to-
day must be managed with the same
skills as would be appropriate in pri-
vate business, but who also want a
full understanding of the special, car-
ing environment these service organi-
zations provide to patients,”
according to Dr. H. J. ZofferJr., dean
of Pitt's Graduate School of Business.

Admission requirements for the-
M.H.A. are a bachelor's degree from

Out of the fire

Pitt student recalls memory of Beirut

By Maria Ritz

Sta ff Writer

Many college students have had
the frustrating experience of being
unable to understand a professor's
lecture. Many have felt the anxieties
of attending a college without the
comforts and securities of high
school.

Imagine studying in a foreign coun-
try where you've never been before,
in a language you don't fully un-
derstand. ‘

Ramzi Zibaoui arrived in the
United Statesgfrom Lebanon with few
ideas about what to expect in the
country where he wanted to study
electrical engineering. When he
graduates from Pitt in April, he will
return to his family, after having

* realized his goal, with many changed
, ideas concerning American life.

Zibaoui has not seen his sisters,
brother or parents since he left

_ Lebanon in 1983. He has only one

relative in the United States, a cousin
whom he has not seen in two years.

Zibaoui explained, ’’I came to the
United States to take advantage of the
greater market and opportunities, like
many foreigners do. If you work hard
and use your imagination here, you
can become something.”

When Zibaoui arrived in the
United States, he applied to five col-
leges and studied-English toimprove
upon his knowledge of grammar.

’’I couldn't understand people
because of their accents, their slang
and my lack of vocabulary. Living the
language is the best way to learn it,”
he explained. .

He moved to Pittsburgh and en-
rolled in English, political-science
and psychology courses at Point Park
College during the fall term of 1983,

where he recalled having some help-
.ful professors.

Zibaoui said, ”They could see I
was having trouble getting notes, so
they often took time to help me and
other international students with pro-
nunciations and spelling.”

Zibaoui came to Pitt in the winter
term with his English much im-
proved. Now he has little difficulty
with his courses beyond mastering

the science of engineering itself.
Language is no longer a problem.

’’I really enjoy the people of Pitts-
burgh. They're friendly and, even
though Pitt's a big school, my en-
gineering class is small enough that
I know most of [the other students].
Sometimes you feel alone, but never
lonely. There's a difference.”

Zibaoui prefers the university
system in the United States to col-
leges in Lebanon.

”lt’s a tough situation because if
you fail even one course in five you
are tested in at the end of the term,
you have to repeat all five.” He said
that like American universities, those
in Lebanon have high tuition, though
some are funded in part by the gov-
ernment.

Lebanon. He cited that it is often the
trend of Lebanese youth to study
abroad where resources are not so
limited and, perhaps, return to
Lebanon to begin a career. Despite
the turmoil, which reaches all aspects
of life, the Lebanese have adapted to
living with war.

Zibaoui said, ”People continue to
live their lives as normally as possi-
ble, enjoying recreation and social
events. Where it is easier for the
.young to pick up and‘move to Amer-
ica or Europe, families don't seern to
adjust as well. My family is happier
to stay in Lebanon.”

Zibaoui said the Lebanese handle
the challenge of surviving by watch-
ing the news to stay on top of
developing situations and moving
temporarily if the fighting comes too
close. ”Life goes on,” he sum-
marized.

Watching many hours of local and
national news broadcasts weekly,
Zibaoui said that he believes the
media is biased in both the United
States and Lebanon — with one ma-
jor difference.

’’In Lebanon the people realize
this,” Zibaoui said. ”Here they don't.
I think the best way to understand the
news is to read book interpretations.”

Zibaoui’s father's philosophy con-
cerning the reason the United States
remains a superpower has been rein-
forced by Zibaoui’s experiences here.
”Foreigners make this a great coun-
try,” he said. ”|t’s a give and take
situation. People come here from all
overthe world to gain from the op-
portunity and become Something bet-
ter, but in return, they give us the
quality of their achievements. For-
eigners are interested in subjects in
which the United States needs know-
ledge. They fill the gaps [left by]
American citizens.”

Zibaoui isn't necessarily sold on

L the United States. He is able to see

the flaws from a more objective van-
tage point. ”The court system, drug
problems, poverty, laziness — I've
learned a lot from the city.”

But Zibaoui smiled when talking
about American comedians such as
Johnny Carson, one of his favorites.

”lt’s great that they can make fun
of President Reagan and get away
with it,” Zibaoui said. ”ln other coun-
tries, someone who ridiculed the
government would disappear from
the face of the Earth the next day.”

Fascinated with the American ob-
session with sports, he said, ”The
priorities are so different here. Sports
are limited in Lebanon because of the
country's small size. Rival teams
don't develop with fanatics. The peo-
pl‘e’s minds are on the war.”

Zibaoui has no long-term plans
beyond returning to Lebanon in
April. The 23-year-old may come
back to the United States to pursue
his master's degree, but not necessari-
ly at Pitt.

He stressed that his years in the
United States have taught him in-
valuable lessons in money manage-
ment and responsibility.

’’I matured much faster here than
I would have at home,” he said. ”lt’s
a jungle here, a materialistic world.
You can't allow people to take advan-
tage of you. But my experiences have
made me grow.”

Back ar brawl

Pitt slide
conﬁnues
at CMU

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

Hard times continue for the Pltt
soccer team. The Panthers fell again
Tuesday afternoon, losing to CMU
1-0.

’’It was another tough game.” said
Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher, ’,’We did
everything right, but put the ball into
the net. It just proves if you can't
score, you can't win.”

Both teams came out storming at
the beginning of the game. Pitt
wanted to climb back into the win
column, and CMU wanted to give a
good showing for their last home
game.

Just two minutes into the game,
CMU was ready to score. They
moved the ball down the field, and
got in close. The Pitt defense held
strong, and turned the Tartans away.
The ball was kicked into the CMU
side of the field, but was soon back
to the Pitt side. This time Pitt goalie
Mark Hendricks made a good save to
stop the threat.

The Tartans kept on pressing, but
were continually turned away by the
wall known as the Panther defense.

Finally the Pitt offense came alive.
They hit crisp passes, and easily
moved through the CMU defense.
Everytime they would get close to the
net, an errant shot or the play of Tar-
tan goalie Reid Thiel would stop
them cold.

”The team played very hard.” said
Pitt freshman Bryan Hammond. ”We
just didn't capitalize on their

' mistakes.”

Pitt totally dominated the rest of the
first half. The ball rarely reached Hen-
dricks, and when it did it was quick-
ly tossed out. The half ended
deadlocked at 0-0.

The second half started as a con-
tinuation of the first. Pitt kept up their
domination, but just could not put
the ball into the net. Then, all of a
sudden, CMU came back to life.
Their offense started to move down
the field, but they couldn't get the
ball into the net, either. The ball was
again sent to the CMU side of the
field, and again Pitt couldn't score.

Then, with about 28 minutes left
in the game, the Tartans started a run
down the field. They crashed into the
Panther defense, but kept up the pres-

Editor-in-Chief

Anyone who has watched Pitt foot-
ball this season knows that the Pan-
thers have made great strides with the
passing game this season. Well, it
may go one step further next year.

Pitt head football coach Mike Gott-
fried declared Monday that he will
concentrate this year’s recruiting
primarily on receivers.

”We will recruit players for virtu-
ally every area," Gottfried said, ”but
we will bring in more receivers than
any other position.”

Gottfried also said he will bring in
three quarterbacks with next year's
recruiting class.

So far this season, Pitt, behind the
arm of quarterback John Congemi,

recruiting will concentrate on passing game

has rolled up 2,750 yards of total
offense, 1,862 of which came
through the air. Last year, Pitt passed
for only 1,421 yards the entire
season. V .
Congemi, however, is a senior.
Next year, the quarterbacking chores
will fall into the hands of either red-
shirt junior Sal Genilla, a record set-
ting junior college transfer from San
Mateo, Calif., or Larry Wanke, a red-
shirt freshman from Cleveland, Ohio,
who was impressive during this past
August’s preseason camp at
Edinboro. ‘
Gottfried said he likes to carry a
good number of quarterbacks and
even more receivers so he can easi-
ly execute his run-and-shoot offense.
While NCAA rules prohibit Gott-
fried from commenting on exactly

who he is recruiting, he is allowed
to say what he is looking for.

’’I want receivers who have speed"

and who can catch the ball," Gott-

4 fried said. ”Size is not necessarily that

important to me."
Pitt loses senior Chuck Scales to

graduation but has returning its lead-

ing receivers Bill Osborne (23
catches for 303 yards), a sophomore
from Wildwood Crest, N.J., and Reg-
gie Williams (17 catches for 239
yards), a sophomore from Beaver
Falls.

Gottfried said he would not leave
former coach Foge Fazio’s tradition-
ally strong recruiting areas in Penn-
sylvania, New Jersey and Florida but
added he would like to spread it
around a little more. Last year he got
the ball rolling, landing defensive

lineman Terrance Banks from Kansas

City, Mo., Jeff VanHorne, a place-
kicker from Cheney, Wash., and Mar-
cus Washington, a defensive back
from Mobile, Ala. J

’’I expect to keep recruiting in
[Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Flori-
da] strongly,” Gottfried said, ”but I
also expect to see Ohio become a
strong recruiting area for us, among
others.”

Four players from Gottfried’s first
recruiting class have seen consider-
able action. Punter John Rasp from
Irwin, place-kicker Jeff VanHorne,
receiver Hosea Heard from Valdos-
ta, Ga., and running back/receiver
Doug Hetzler from North Hills have

all contributed to the Pitt attack this _

year. V

Pitt to stick with passing game this weeend

By Bob Travers
Staff Writer

Mike Gottfried said yesterday that
Pitt would not deviate from its pass-
oriented offensive attack to take ad-
vantage of Syracuse's weak rushing
defense.

"You're going to do what you do
best,” Gottfried said. ”We are primar-
ily a passing team now, and we are
going to stick with that.”

One could make a strong case not
to pass at all against the Orangemen’s
defense, so poor are they at stopping
the run. Syracuse has given up 1,992
yards on the ground this year in just
seven games. That works out to an
average of over 284 yards per game.

The defense has taken most of the
heat for Syracuse's awful start. The
Orangemen are 2-7 with wins over
Temple and Missouri — and this af-
ter it was thought at the beginning of
the season that Syracuse would be
one of the best teams in the East this
yean

Syracuse has been a team that has
done exactly the opposite of what
people have been expecting them to
do this year. A heavy underdog last
week against Temple, Syracuse
stunned the Owls 27-24 on a field
goal late in the game.

  
 

ATTENTION ALL PITT STUDENTS

”You can't imagine how wonder-
ful it felt to get that win,” said be-
leaguered Syracuse coach Dick
MacPherson. ”But this week we
know we will have a difficult game.
I think Pittsburgh has the second best
talent of any team in the East.”

In other developments, Gottfried
said he would begin to cut down this
week on the amount of time his team
practices.

”We’ve been practicing since Aug.
6,”.Gottfried said. ”We are just cut-
ting back to keep everybody fresh.
Our receivers do a lot of running
every practice, and I noticed last
Thursday that they were looking very
lethargic, so we didn't practice Fri-
day.” Gottfried added that cutting
back on practice time as the year
progresses is something he has done
everywhere he has coached.

Gottfried summed up his team's
progress this way: ’’I think we're im-

proving. But I don't think we're any- ‘

where near where we want to be. We
aren't devastating like the top teams
in the country are, but I think we are
getting better. We have four very
tough games ahead of us, and we are
going to take them one at a time. I
think after those four games we will

Pitt alumnus and former Pitt Pan-
ther Curtis Smith has gone Holly-
wood. Well, not quite. Actually he
has gone to Cleveland to take part in
the Cleveland Brown's Master's of
the Gridiron promotion video which
is the latest addition to the ever-
growing number of football videos.

Most of these videos, such as the
Cleveland Browns’ Superbowl Shuf-
fle, merely showcase a few players
rapping to a" self-praising song. This
video is different, though.

Masters of the Gridiron is an
action-packed fantasy video, featur-
ing the Cleveland Browns as the bar-
baric tribe of Modella. The tribe's
main objective is to retrieve the Ring
of Power from the Evil Emperor,
played by Tiny Tim.

The Browns’ main opposition in
acquiring the ring is the Evil Em-
peror’s guards, who, by the way, are
all martial arts experts and members
of the American Martial Arts Stunts
Association. This is where Pitt’s very
own Curtis Smith comes into the
action.

Smith, a member of AMASA, was
contacted by Richard Fike, the
video's choreographer, to add his
martial arts talent to the video's fight
scenes.

Smith, who is currently an officer
of the University Police force, teaches
a course in basic self-defense and
heads the chapter of the East-West
Martial Arts Club.

Smith is not new to Pitt by any
means. He was a student at the
universityfrom 1973 to 1975.. He

‘ also played football for the Panthers

during that time and was part of the
famed ”Cinderel|a Era” under coach
Jackie Sherrill.

During that time, Smith became
seriously interested in the martial arts.
After football practice, he would
head to the YMCA for instruction in
the martial arts.

While at Pitt, Smith became in-

volved in law enforcement. He be-
came an apprentice in a police

V training program.

"Due to a loss of personal incentive
to continue playing football, the
game soon faded from the forefront
of Smith's career.

A career in law enforcement in-
struction and the martial arts re-
mained, and he became very
successful in both. Smith is consid-
ered one of the nation's top law en-
forcement instructors and graduated

Smith's martial arts accomplish-

silver medal in the open national
weapons division and most recently
a gold and silver medal at the Penn-
sylvania Belt Karate Championships.

With all of Smith's experience in
the martial arts, it seems only ap-

Oakland doctor equates athle

: By Rick Fellinger

Staff Writer

I Dr. George Pappas is a 20th cen-

tury: sports sorcerer.

About two months ago he, expand-
ed his sports medicine clinic into
Oakland. His practice is centered
around hypnotherapy which is aimed

. at treating athletes of all ages who

have trouble sustaining their level of
concentration while performing.

Pappas has worked with athletes
from all levels of the sports world, in-
cluding a few Steelers and Penguins,
along with some Pitt footballand
basketball players.

The most common problem that
‘Pappas treats is what he calls ”com-
petitive anxiety.” He helps the ath-
lete to decrease this anxiety and deal
with game pressures by working on
mental imagery skills. For example,

7 Pappas would help a hockey goalie

to ”focus on the puck and eliminate
everything else.” He said, ”[I would]
have him visualize himself having a
good game and how the puck felt
and how he stopped the puck — ac-
tually have him seeing himself not al-
lowing the puck to get into the net.”

Since some people respond better
to different points of view, Pappas
sometimes has the. athlete see the
event through the eyes of a specta-
tor as well as from the player's own
perspective.

Coming across an athlete who
plays well during practice but chokes
when game time comes around isn't
hard to do. Pappas thinks that there

is a typical case of this right here in
Pitt's backyard: one of the Panther
place-kickers. Pappas feels that hyp-
nosis, specifically the use of mental
imagery, would have lowered his
anxiety, increased his level of con-
centration and prevented him from
missing so many crucial field goals
at the beginning of this season.

Pappas never worked with him, but
he feels that the place-kicker had the
physical ability to handle Pitt's kick-
ing chores but could not handle
game pressure.

Pappas, who earned his degree at
Pitt and has also taught here, isn't
afraid to speak up about other local
teams that might benefit from hypno-
sis. For instance, he is a fan of Mark
Ma|one’s and thinks that Malone
deserves the starting quarterback spot
in Chuck Noll’s offense. A lot of the
offensive woes can be blamed on a
lack of concentration on the part of
the Pittsburgh receivers instead of on
the QB. _

This storyholds weight, especia|- I
ly when you consider that Louis Lipps
has been dropping a lot of catchable
passes this year, and Weegie Thomp-
son's hands are bricks. ’

Because he swears confidentiality,
Pappas didn't say whether he has
ever worked with any membersof
the Steeler offensive squad. Hyp-
notherapy could possibly improve
the Pittsburgh passing game. It cer-
tainly couldn't hurt.

Pappas stresses that in order for an
athlete to benefit from hypnosis, he
or she first must fully develop the

physical skills necessary for that par-
ticular sport or position.

Pappas was a little skeptical about
the extent to which an eight-year-old
hockey player that he treated had
mastered his hockey talents, but the
boy's father insisted that he was
”highly advanced." This eight-year-
old is the youngest athlete that Pap-

‘ pas has treated.

A majority of the players that Pap-
pas sees are of high school age with
college students next and profession-
als the least. He explained why he
thinks not too many pros seek his
help: .”There is a stigma attatched to
going to see a psychologist because
people think that there is something
wrong with them. But this is going to

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 29, I986

dissipate as sports psychology be-
comes recognized in years to come.”

The field of sports psychology is al-
ready much more established on the
West Coast than it is in this part of
the country. Pappas thinks this is be-
cause of a more open-minded atti-
tude on the sun belt. ”They’re more
receptive to new ideas,” he said.

In fact, the San Diego Chargers and
Los Angeles Rams have employed
clinical psychologists. They are not
hypnotists, however. Their job is to
counsel the players for non-
performance-related problems like‘
drugs and alcohol, being away from
their family and managing the huge
sums of money that some of them
make.

Not all of the athletes who visit
Pappas are looking for psychological
help. About 20 percent of his patients
see him for physiological assistance.
He helps some potential marathoners
to determine their aerobic capacity
and advises them on whether it
would be wise for them to run in a
marathon. If not, he suggests that they
increase their training before they at-
tempt such a long distance.

Pappas was the sports psychologist
for this year's Pittsburgh Marathon
back in May. He has had other offers
from some pro franchises in the area
who are interested in having him
work with their team, but he
wouldn't say exactly who they were.

He did say he has been in touch
with Mike Gottfried about working
with the Panther football program,
since he already has seen a few of his

ticsuccess with hypnosis

players, but Gottfried ”did not seem
interested.” Pappas thinks that this is
partly because of Gottfried’s ’’lack of
familiarity with sports psychology.”

Pappas would ”very much like to
work with Pitt's program.” He stat-
ed, ”lt’s my alma matter. I like to see
them do great.” He's somewhat op-
timistic about his chances of working
with Gottfried’s squad in the future,
”He’s new. He'll probably get
around to it.”

No Pirates have come to Pappas
yet for mental training. Pappas be-
lieves that ”the one player that would
need sports hypnotism the most
would be the baseball player, be-
cause of the boredom and number of
games that have to be played. They
have to keep that level of concen-
tration.”

”A pitcher can pitch great one day
and lousy the next. His physical skills
have not changed, but his level of
concentration has,” Pappas said.

About the only way for Pappas to
determine the success rate of the pa-
tient is by the feedback that the pa-
tient gives him, because there's no
way to scientifically correlate the
results. _

”The only thing I can go on,” Pap-
pas said, ”is what the player tells me
— how pleased they are.” So far most
of his patients have been more than
pleased. _

Sports hypnosis is still very new,
but it's a growing field, especially
here in Pittsburgh. According to Dr.
Pappas, ”it is only in it's infancy.”

There are two types of volleyball
— the kind played at the high school
level and the Division I ”A” collegi-
ate style. Lady Panther Denise
Frawley knows that there is a world
of difference between the two.

As a senior at Westlake High in
Thornwood, N.Y., Frawley guided
her team to an unblemished 20-O
state title season. However, Frawley
credits most of her valuable ex-
perience to her three years of involve-

' ment in the PepsiCo Junior Olympic

program.

It wasn't until Denise's junior year
that she became really serious about
volleyball. ”l was bored with the
sport in high school,” she said. ”I

came back from volleyball camp, and
I really got involved with the sport.”
Until this point, Frawley had been
very busy as a basketball player.

When the time came for Frawley
to pick a college, she knew she want-
ed to go to a city school. ’’I ignored
the schools out West. I didn't want
to be too far from home. I really liked
Pittsburgh,” Frawley noted. ’’I liked
the coach also. He knows how to
recruit.”

More importantly, Denise didn't
want to be in a position where she
”had to carry the team.” Denise
found the prestige behind Pitt's
volleyball program particularly at-
tractive.

In retrospect, Frawley notices ”the

intensity of a college match. There
are a lot of positive additions to the

 

style of a major Division I team over
the game I played in high school, and
an increased intensity is one of
them."

Since coming to Pitt a year ago,
Frawley has switched positions from
middle hitter to outside hitter. An ex-
cellent defensive hitter, Frawley is
pleased with the move. ”I am play-
ing in my favorite slot. There's a lot
of action in this position, and I feel
that it shows the best aspect of my
game —— defensive hitting.” The bad
aspects must come with the good.
Frawley notes, ”I am here to get bet-
ter as a player. Right now, in this
phase of my career, I need to improve
my serve receiving."

Offensively, Frawley had her best
match of the season against Santa
Barbara. Against the Tennessee

Volunteers, she played one of her
best defensive matches to date.

Often overshadowed by team-
mates Sue Hoover and Lisa Stewart,
Frawley is striving for consistency.
Plagued by arthritic feet, Frawley
goes through periods where she can-
not play as she'd like. ’’I like to know

that I'm doing my best. It's very frus-

trating to be on the court, trying my
hardest and not being able to "play my
best,” Frawley stated. ”When my feet
don't hurt I am truly able to go all out.
I am accepting this  for now.”

Frawley credits teammate Stewart
with improving her shots. ”From
watching Lisa hit, I have been able
to select my hits better. If I had to
choose someone-as my role model,
I'd say itiwould have to be Lisa
Stewart.”

Frawley powering Lady Panther spikers

Denise Frawley is very much a
goal-oriented player. Frawley’s goals
are not as much those of an individu-
al as those of a teammate.

The remainder of Pitt's schedule
is flecked with nationally ranked
teams. Frawley stated, ”It’s important
that we continue to prepare for the
Big East tournament. We need to
continue to improve as individuals
and as a team. We are going to win
the conference this year.”

If the Lady Panthers do not win the
Big East, there will be no NCAA bid.

More immediately, the lady Pan-
thers will face arch-rival Penn State
this weekend for the third time this
season. Denise points out, ”We have
not yet played our game against PSU.
We hope to come out strong and
suprise them. I know I still have the
other two losses in mind.”

Syracuse quarterback Donnie MacPherson was nothing
but trouble for the Panthers last year.at Pitt Stadium as
he led the Orangemen to a 12-0 win inthe rain. This year,
things have not been as rosy for Syracuse. MacPherson
and mates have a 2-5 record".

sure. CMU player Eddie Park got the
ball, and it was soon into the net. The
Tartansled 1-0.
At this point the Pitt players could
- see another loss looming in the back-
round. They didn't want this to hap-
pen, so they opened up their offense.
The CMU defense let them through
again. But this time the Panthers
couldn’t get much of anything off, be-
cause the CMU players got to the ball
and cleared it out. Just as soon as they
would get it out, Pitt was right back
in. Time and again Pitt would walk
away with nothing.
CMU started to go down the field,
and would have scored again if it

wasn't for the fact that their-shots

were going high and wide. After that
small scare, Pitt continued their

domination of the game. But just’
couldn't putgthe ball into the net. The V
game ended with the CMU Tartansu

leading 1-0.

”This is very depressing,” said-

Hammond. ”We dominated the

whole game, but still came out on the if I

Pitt runners
impressive at
Big East meets
in Boston

By Calvin Holmes
Staff Writer

If traveling to Boston 13 hours by
van put a_th,o_rn_ i_nE'itt’{s men’s_and
women’s cross country team, it didn't
show too much. The Panthers’ ran
well this past weekend at the Big East
Cross Country Championships.

Pitt head coach John Vasvary was
pleased with the performance of the
men's team. After the meet he com-
mented that ”they had done better
than anytime before.” if

The team fin_i_s_hed 5th in the meet
out offnine teams.lGeorgetown was
the overall winner. First place went
to Mike Starr who is a runner for
Georgetown. A ‘ 1

The Panthers’ top runner was
senior Bob Weiner, who finished
15th_ and received an award, Wein-
er was closely followed by sopho-

more Waddie Freemon who finished ’

16th. Weiner was definitely a team
leader at the Big East meet and has
run well all year. Freemon, a trans-
fer student from Michigan State,
made a big contribution to the Pan-
thers also.

The next finisher was ‘freshman
Paul Freedick who finished 25th.
Coach Vasvary can only expect more

out of his men's team next year. The

team‘ is» made_f of: all -urid,erclass-
men, a'_rid,Weiner' has one more year
of "eligibility left. Coach ‘Vasvary
hopes that next year's team will de-
velop ‘several runners who can place
in the top five.

On the other side of the scope, the
women’s team didn't have an out-
standing performance, but they were
competitive. They finished 7th over-
all, but they were expected to place
lower. Lori Wood did not perform to
her capability, which she has shown
all year. Last year she finished in the
top five, but only managed to finish
22nd this year. Perhaps her perform-
ance was lacking due to the change
in the running course from last year.

Wood is capable of running over
slopes and uphill well, but the course
this year was basically flat. The other
runners ran well, but the team need-
ed one runner to finish in the top 10
to even place low in the overall
standings.

The cross country season for the
Panthers will be ending soon. This
Saturday both teams will be par-
ticipating in theJ.F.K. meet in Schen-
ley Park and close out their season
the following weekend at the NCAA

bRegionals.

are as a team.”

The moving around of players this
season is over,” according to Gott-
fried. Last week tight end Vernon Kirk
was_ switched to linebacker. Tom

Heubner will be Pittis tight end when »

they use one, which has not been
very often this season.

The injury report keeps getting
brighter for Pitt. The only major
casualty right now is wide receiver

Reggie Williams, who broke his leg
in the Purdue game. Gottfried said
Williams has been working out ‘in
sweats with the team, but has yet to
put on pads. Williams will definitely
be out this week, but may be ready
for the Miami game on Nov. 8.

This week's game will mark the se-
cond time in his coaching career that
Gottfried has coached in a domed
stadium. His Cincinnatti team once
played Tulane in the Louisiana Su-
perdome. ».~.-
