    , Cassiano To  oach
 Panther Backfield

Dandy Dick‘ Cassiano, one of the ﬁnest in a long line. of ﬁne
,. Pitt halfbacks, has been named Panther backﬁeld coach, the athletic

department announced.

 

Now assistant coach at Dartmouth college, Cassiano was an
outstanding left half-here from 1937 through 1939-——and an outstand-

‘ ing student. An honor graduate, he was the recipient of the

ODK Senior Award.

Dick Fisher, who coached the
varsity backﬁeld the past season,‘

now becomes coach of the first
‘ freshman squad at Pitt since 1942.
Rudy. Gradisek will handle the
freshman-line. Coach Wes Feslerfs
‘varsity 1 assistants will be line
coach Mike Milligan, end coach
Lyal Clark, Junior Varsity mentor
Ralph Mitterling, and Cassiano.
Outstanding Frosh Athlete
Cassiano came here from Al-
bany,‘N. Y., in 1936, and promptly
carried off the award then given

for the outstanding Pitt freshman,‘
_ athlete. The freshman coach, in-‘
. cidentally,

was the same «Mike
Milligane now on the Pitt stall’.
In his first varsity appearance

the next fall, against Ohio Wes- .

‘Ieyan, Cassiano ran, for four
touchdowns and threw passes for
_‘_two others. The ‘1937 squad,

coached by’Jock Sutherland, had .
only a scoreless tie with Fordham ..

to mar a perfect season. Cassiano
started one game that year and
subbed for Marshall. Goldberg in-
every other. _

His junidr,year he starred in
the Dream Backﬁeld, with Gold-

-berg, Curly Stebbins and Johnny’

Chickerneo, and in 193% he won
All-East honors playing under
Charley Bowser. Only the medi-_
ocre record of t‘he,l939 squad kept
him off All-American.

_« ,. Assiztant At_ Dartmouth

After graduating he played a
year with Sutherl-and’s profes-

, ‘sional Brooklyn Dodgers, but de-

cided he was too light and moved

to Dartmouth as Tus McLaughry’s .
Throughout -

backﬁeld. assistant.
his playing career‘ he weighed be-
tween 160 and 170 pounds.

During the war he served as a '

lieutenant in the Navy. Upon dis-
charge he returned to Dartmouth.

He goes on active duty at Pitt
on lj‘eb.ruary l.

Neiv Process
Speeds Grades
To Students

The Registrar’s office has bow-
ed to the era of the machine. _

Endicott A. Batchelder, assist-
ant re,/gistrar, revealed that ma-
chines developed by the Interna-
tional Business Machine corpora-
.tion will eliminate most of the
hand work previously required
in the recording of grades and
will institute a system of com-
pilation. which will be quicker
and, at the same time, more ef-
ficient. ’

The advent of the new process
signals the gradual demise of
the blueprint, long the symbol of
anticipation and anguish. The
blueprint will continue in.nse lor
all studentsowho enrolled prior
to September 1946, but, for fresh-
men, a new form of permanent
record will be employed.

1 ’ Greater Efficiency

The revised system
efiiciency with a mechanical pro-
cessv,_that is virtually foolproof,
while decreasing the time element
involved.

The cards containing the course
grades willéfbe received by the
Registrar's office and checked by
machine to assure that all courses
have been accounted for and that
the final di;-alt of the student’s
grade report lform will be com-
plete.

The class cards will then’ be
placed in. a tabulator—printer
which is capable of turning out
approxiinately- per minute "eight
series oi‘ report forms each con-
taining an original and-’ﬁve du-
plicate copies.

Under this system the student

Edit-or
Pitt News
In our opinion, the recently re-
iterated decision on the part of
the University to refrain from un-
yd-ertaking a positive housing pro-
gram is morally indefensible.
i_ One year ago Pitt declined to
_accept emergency housing facili-
ties which the FHA offered. Prior
‘to this refusal, considerable op-

Oakland property’ owners to the
erection of temporary units on the
ground that such units would

A faculty committee appointed
;:.to study housing and advise the
4chancellor conﬁrmed the Univer-
sity’s original stand. Recently in
;an effort to reopen the question
we requested the University to

"dents to determine over-all hous-
"ng needs. The faculty committee
declined to recommend this action
-on the grounds that the Univer-
sity was allegedly in no position
to alleviate the shortage and did
not intend to put itself into such
a position. This is the situation at
resent.

Faculty Bases

Inaction up to now has been
defended on these bases:

(1) Pitt’s refusal allows govern-
’ . ment housing to be used at

small town schools where
housing is a more urgent
problem.

('2) The University has no avail-
T able sites not earmarked for
other purposes.

Pitt is situated in a commu-
V, nity and must get along with
other members of the com-
munity.

Pitt is an urban university.
Its primary responsibility is
to provide educational facili-
ties. On this basis the Uni-
versity does not consider
housing a proper responsibili-
ty. Moreover, criticism of this
policy is ‘officially discourag-
ed. William Saalbach, assist-
ant Dean of Men, recently
stated to the student housing
committee that no action
should be taken which might
tend to discredit or embarrass
the University. Any such ac-
tion, it was indicated, might
force the University to ‘wash
its hands’ of all housing mat-
ters.

to

Student Appeal

.'I‘hese are the University’s
remises. In point by point re-
buttal, we submit the following:
-(1) Other schools may have
. greater need for housing. But
i today, one year after Pitt re-
fused to accept emergency
_h-0-using, many units are still
..available. Even if this were
‘ c not the case, such an argu-

   
  

position had been evidenced by ,

lower property values in the area. I

Tconaduct a survey of all Pitt stu- t

ment presupposes that gov-
ernment housing is the only
alternative. Far from it. Car-
negie Tech and Duquesne
have both recently taken over
existing private dwellings for
use as dormitories. And the
University of Miami has just
completed a $2,000,000 co-
operative ' student-f a c u l ty
dwelling, ﬁnanced by FHA.
These things are possible.
No sites. But the oppo_rtunity
existed, and perhaps -still
does, to utilize the Oval in
Schenley park. Also, ground
can be rented,:,it can be pur-
chased, it can be ‘requested
from the city -- or the Ca-
thedral lawn might be used.

itself indicated that the prob-

Mr. .. Saalbach, we would like 3

to point outj that threats of

Housing School Problem

We aﬂirm that housing is and .

should be a valid concern of the

University. Education is a social ,.

thing, as well as an affair of class-

es and books; a decent place to .~
live is as important to a student .
as the personal inspiration of a .

teacher’s presence. We call on

the University to broaden its re- l

sponsibility to cope with the
greater demands the situation
presents. The measure of
growth is a matter of moment to
all of us.

Pitt Cops Pair;
BeatsBucks
And Bisons

You’ll have to go far to ﬁnd a
scrappier team than the Panthers.
The never-give-up kids won two
games this week and they did it
the hard way —— roaring from be-
hind.

In the wildest ﬁnish of the sea-
son, Carlson’s ever—striving quin-
tet won a deservin-g, 51-41 tri-'
umph over Ohio State.

Trailing 39-37 with only three
and a half minutes remaining, the
Panthers whipped in 14 points
and held the Buckeyes to a pair of
free throws in gaining their third
victory of the campaign.

Top Bisons, 55-47

Pitt had to come from behind
in the third quarter to take a 55-
47 decision from Bethany-’s' Bisons.

When the Bisons switched from
a man-to-man to a tight zone,
Pitt’s 22-10 ﬁrst quarter lead was
whittled down to a meager, 24-21.
However Do-c Carlson had the so-
lution for that one.

He moved Wally Zernich into
the pivot and had Sam David cut-
ting in from the side court. Be-
tween them, they put on a two-
man show to overcome a four-
point deﬁcit and put the Panthers
in front, 38-35.

In the ﬁnal stanza, the Carlson-
ites steadily‘ forged ahead and
with the count at 51-36, Panther
reserves took over. -

Gage Slants . . .
Because of an ofﬁcials’ error,
Ed Latagliata, who was charged

Doc Carlson silent for a few moments while the “two officials

squabble during the Pitt-Ohio State contest which the Panthers won

with ﬁve personals, remained in
the game while Ohio State’s Jack
Underman ﬂipsped in a penalty
toss to tie the score, 40-40.

After Cieply’s long set shot put
Pitt ahead, 42-40, the error was
discovered. Following a 15 minute
talk-fest, the oﬁicials ruled that
State’s foul toss and Pitt’s ﬁeld
goal would count. Reason: Time
had been consumed onthe clock.

Crisler Believes
Fesler Wonderful

of athletics and head football
coach at the University of
Michigan, stated that “Pitt has
a. wonderful football coach” in
an interview with the Pitt News
earlier this week.

Mr. Crisler, in the city for a.
YMCA banquet, believes Fes-
ler to be the best among the
current crop of young coaches.
The Michigan mentor knew
Coach Fesler as a player and a
coach and believes him to be
remarkable in both categories.

He had no predictions to
make concerning his 1947 team
which will meet the Panthers.

til a photostatic copy of the cu-

At the forthcoming registration,
grades will be distributed to all
students on a temporary grade re-
port form which will contain only
the grades received in the semes-
ter previous to registration.

Later in thesemester the grades

will be transposed from the tem-
gporary form to 21 cumulative mas-
ter record in the case of new stu-
dents and to the master blueprint
in the case of those who entered
Pitt prior: toseptember 1946.
" Th procedure formerly utilized
enabledfthe Registrars office to
complete in time for registration
only two; blueprints, one for the
student and one for the dean of
his sc_ho;ol.'

With approximately 16,000 stu-
dents requiring blueprints before
beginning the February semester,
the commercial blueprinting com-
pany would have been faced with
32,000
copies in little more than 48 hours.
Two daysvis all the time that re-
rnains alter grades of individual
courses have been sorted and then
hand-copied on the master record.

The AEPhi’s are starting early
(but we guess you have to in or-
der to get anywhere in the world
today——for example, 6:15 a. m.)
by announcing that they and their
sisters from Tech will be hostess-
es_ at a regional Conclave, March
1 and 2 at the Fort Pitt establish-
ment. (Hotel, that is!)

The Kappavs‘ dropped in at the
Phi Gain house a few days ago to
meet a lot of new fellows they al-
ready knew (had a fine time, any-
way.)

The Beta Sig’s are taking over

Bob Jones perusing the lyrics of
Lover Come Back to Me and
glancing up to ﬁnd Franklin
Blackstone obstructing his View
of femininity. Speaking of Bob
Jones, it was his brain that con-
ceived the plan to wake up Tut
Patrick at 5 a. In. Monday morn-
ing so he could be early ‘-to reg-
ister. It wasn’t until after stand-
ing in line for about three hours
that Patrick, a Bus Ad stude,
found out he wasn't supposed to
register ’til the next morning.

Jim Duchene lit twenty-one
matches on a piece of Tuck Shop
cake to celebrate his maturity—-
and the right to drink legally.
