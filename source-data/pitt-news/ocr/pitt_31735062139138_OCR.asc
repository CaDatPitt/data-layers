Letter to Director Miller Says
That Rumor of Wet Field in
I9Io Entirely False.

. A letter from Graduate Manager Ray

H. Smith, of Pennsylvania State Col-

lege, published Monday in the Pitts-
burgh newspaper, shows that the ath-

letic authorities of the University have»

ﬁnally brought to ahead the «old charges
which were circulated back in 1910, and
revived each year around footlball time,
relative to the alleged “watering” of the
Forbes l<‘ield.gridiron for the Pitt-State
football game that year. Mr. Smit-h’s
letter is reproduced in full at, the end
of this article. _
The following words of explanation
from Graduate Manager K. E. 'Davis,
-who was in close touch with athletic
.affa.irs» around that time, seem apropos,
in order that the lower classmen, who
have entered since that time, may be
cognizant of all the facts. '

: “Forbes Field was constructed during

‘ the spring of 1909, the National League
«baseball team occupying it tha-t sum-
mer and the ﬁrst football games being‘

played there that fall by the Uni'veI.':s~ity
eleven. The most part of the ﬁeld, espe-

cially’ that near the score board and vi-

cinity, known as center ﬁeld, was “ﬁlled”

-ground. This was of such a nature that.

a -perfect drainage system could not be
installed immediately and the natural
settling process would alone bring this
effect. P

W. H. DUFF ADDRESSES

. Ecouoligs STUDENTS

Wm._ H. Duff, 11., manager of the
Duff & Sons- Manufacturing Company,
addressed the members of the School of
‘Economicsof the University of Pitts-
zburgh at the weekly assembly yesterday
'morning in Thaw Hall. Mr. Duff spoke
on “So e Phases of Salesmanship." He
contra ed the present day methods that
are employed by the sales departments
of up-to-date ﬁrms with that of the
system that was used not so many years
ago.

“In the old days,” said Mr. Duff, “the
salesman trie-d to bribe -the customer
into buying his goods. The, ﬁrst thing
that he did when he went to a man was
to hand him a cigar and invite him out
to lunch. Now he gets. right down to
business and tells him all that he has
to say concerning the goods that he has
for sale, and gets out of the way as
soon as it is possible, and does. not take
any more of the man’s time than is ab-
solutely needful. ,

“There are three things that every
salesman must know, if he wishes to
make a success of his trade,” said Mr.
Duff. ‘‘In the ﬁrst place, he must un-
derstand every phase of the goods that
he is selling. He must be able to an-
swer any question about the goods that
he is asked. Then he must know him-
self absolutely. He must be able to
meet every situation that comes up and
to ﬁgure from the buyers point of view.
In third place, the salesman must know
his customer. Unless he knows his man
_,he has very little chance of making a
good salesman. a X

“Do not believe,” said Mr. Duffin
conclusion, “‘that salesmen are born-—
not made. Salesmanship is one-tenth
inspiration and nine-tenths per-spira-
tion, and a man has to work and work
hard to get high in the profession.” '_

At-the conclusion of the talk Mr. Duff
answered questions‘ on salesmanship
that were asked by the members of the
school.-A .

ADVISORY “BOARD EEARS

REPORT _EE_ MANAGERS

The Advisory Board on Student Ac-
tivities met last Tuesday afternoon with
representatives of the various student
organizations. Manager C. R. Helt of
the 1914 Owl Board reported that sev-
eral hundred dollars over the one thou-
sand dollars the board was required to
have by the 15th of April had been ob-
tained in actual c-ash. The members -of
the Owl Board were heartily congratu-
lated by the Advisory Committee.

The Cap and Gown Club submitted
the afternoons of April 24th and 25th as
the dates for their home productions.
These dates were approved, and in View
of the fact that the club has decided
to have no advertising in their program
this year, other organizations have been
requested not to interfere between April
1 and_May 15. The trip, which will in-
clude productions in Greensburg, Al-
toona and Johnstown, was also ap-
proved.

Manager W. C. MacQuown of the Pitt
Weekly presented a favorable financial
report.

A report was also received from the
Junior Prom committee, which was ac-
cepted. _ '

The members of the Board presentat,
the meeting were:' Dr. S. B. Linhart,
Mr. C. S. Miller, Mr. T. R. Williams, Mr.
L. J. Affelder, Mr. W. J. Allen and Mr.

ECONOMIC FRESH
. TO BANQUET

 

The Economic Freshies have been
fasting for‘ two days in anticipation of
their annual banquet to be held at the
Hotel Henry this evening at 7:30. The
menu would attract the most fastidious,
so the feast vwill be partaken "a la de-
vour.” Every Economic ‘freshman is
straining every effort to be in on the
“feed/’ and the spirit in this bunch of
youngsters is at fever heat. When
normal they are a hot bunch, so will
hardly be responsible duringsuch an
excitement. Theirlprogram speaks well
for the talent in the class, and includes
such stars as Shipira, Gregory, Morgan,
evy. A quartet will fur-
nish the music, and “T-urk” Steen will
be master of ceremonies.

Debating is to receive an important
place, among the student activities in
The organization of a lit-
erary society has already been pro-
posed, tne purpose of the society being
to stimulate interest along debating and
oratorical lines, and to train the stu-
dents in presenting their thoughts in
public. There is a great amount of lit-
erary material in Pitt," and such a so-
ciety is necessary to devel-ope-it. Ar-
rangements are now being made with
Juniata and Westminster Colleges for
debate meets in the spring term and
the‘ coaches will soon issue a call for
‘candidates. .

MUSICAL CLUBS AT
“ = UNIVERSITY CLUB

 

As special guests of the University
Club the members of the University of
Pittsburgh Musical Clubs were enter-

tained last Saturday night in a royal

fashion at the club on Grant boulevard.
A large number of the members of the
University Club were on hand with
their friends to greet the Pitt musicians,
and join in the jollytime of t-he musical
evening, and, judging from‘ the enthus-
ia.-sm and applause and the willingness

of the gleemen and mandolinists to give .

encores, all had a glorious time. I

The glee and mand lin c1ubs*fur-
nished the musical program fo_r_ the
evening, with many side issues by the
quartet. In the absence of Ilenry T.
Ashe, director of the glee club, H. G.
Lytle lead the singers through their
various contorsions with a style that
pleased the auditors. Lytle 1S a natural
master of ‘the _“baton” and thus he kept
the boysrtuned to a pitch that loaned
an -added -touch. J. Vveinman Cratty
held the mandolin men under his canny
eye and brought out several novel num-

_bers of that organization in the way of

medleys.

"Following the ‘musical program, the
doors of the main dining room of the
club were thrown open to the musicians
for a sumptuous banquet. .‘ .

During the next two weeks the
Musical Club-s will have no concerts,
but will put in ‘two weeks of hard prac-
tice on “home” concert numbers, as well
as prepare several new selections and

«LOCKING -THE DOORS
Many complaints have been made re-
cently 'by members of the ‘student body
of the University concerning the lock-
ing of the class room doors precisely on
the minute that is the scheduled time

 

'1 for classes to take up, and then not per-
. mitting any person to’ enter the room

late and giving every man) that is ab-
sent a cut,’although he may have -ar-~
rived one minute after the doo_r was
closed. Far be it from., THE PITT

. WEEKLY -to attack any of ‘the pro-

fessors, but it does __seem strange that
such action should betaken by any fair-
minded professor. in the University. The
best reason why no ‘instructor should

. adoptthis drastic measure is that’ he is

liable to be late any time himself. If
the‘ professor i permitted to-lock the"
door precisely on" the moment and. not
permit ,any person to enterafter class
has taken up, it wouldnotbe far amiss

‘ victors. '

for the students some morning, if the
instructor happened to be half a min-
ute late, to refuse'co allow him to enter
the classroom,: or at least not attend
the class that‘ morning. There is no
person, so perfect in this world that he
will never be late a minute or two to a
class, especially an 8:30 class, and it is
absolutely unfair for, an instructor to
look a man out of a class because he is
a few minuteslate. There are many
students in the University who live out

on the train, and it is very often incon-
venient to get to the University at 8:30.
Of course we understand that the in-
structors will say that one ought to ,de-
velope the trait of being punctual, and
that if the students were working they
would get to work on time, etc., but
there are many things to be considered
that offset this argument.

THE PITT WEEKLY rather favors
the plan that has been ‘adopted by one
of the professors in the School of
Economics.. This instructor never calls
a man for coming in late, unless he
knows that there is absolutely no (3:-

the other hand, if he is late to ﬂass, he
expects every member of the class to
stay, in the,-room, no matter if he is half
an hour late, until he comes, or until he
sends word officially that -he cannot at-_
tend t-he class. There are very few men
come in late to this class, but if a man,
happens to be late he knows -that he
willl not ﬁnd the door locked or get a

There is not a man in this professors
class that would think of leaving the
room if the instructor -happened to be
late, until he received word that he was
sick or out of town. V ' F

We suggest that some of the other
professors adopt this plan and_ give the
fellows a fair chance. -

PITT GETS THE JUMP

The victory of the Blue and Gold over
the Red and Black last Wednesday even-
ing in the opening game of a series of
contests between the University of
Pittsburgh an«d‘Washingtoii and Jeffer—,
son brought great joy tc)_‘e'/*¥,-"Y 10l10W91‘
of the Pitt team. It was a great game
all .the way and, while the score would
indicate that the contest was rather
easy for our fellows, the fact remains
that the boys-from, Washington put up
a game ﬁght to the ﬁnish, but were a
little outclassed by the Blue and Gold
squad. Many of .the followers of, Pitt
were a bit dubious-before the game
opened as to the result of the. contest,
owing to the fact that one of the star
members of the Pitt squad was out of
the game on -account of injuries. How--
ever, after the game opened there was
little doubt from the start !)1it.th'it Pitt
would be on the big end of the score at
the finish.‘ The fellows all p1ayed_the'
best game that theyihave played since‘
they went on their slump after the great
eastern trip that they made a few
weeks ago. -1 Some thought that the team
had gone stale, but the exhibition that
the men put up Wednesday evening gave
evidence that they have returned to
their true form and will give a good
account of themselves-from now on._

We want to. win the next game, which
takes place at Washington on the 18th
of this month. If we- win this game we-
will have the seri_es without having _to
play a third game. This is what Pitt
wants to do, and we believe that it can
be done. Plans are beingmade to take
a big delegation of Pitt men -down to
Washington to see this game and to root
for the team. Every man that can pos-
sibly go should-. make arrangements at
once to go to thegame. A‘ large crowd
of rooters will make it easier for the
members of the team tocomehome

GOOD WORK, FELLOWS!

The School of\Economics has much
of which they maybe DI‘911}3. but there
is no organization or individual. at the
present time that is bringing as much
favorable ‘publicity to the school than
the Economics Quartette. This organ-
ization has been making a~great reputa-
tion the past few weeks. They are in
demand, in fact they could S1118‘ eV€I‘Y
night if they so desired. The work of
these men at the basket ball game the_
other evening was excellent, and was a
distinctive feature of the evening, en-
tertainment. It has come to be that no
school function is -complete without a
song or two from this qua-rtette, evcn_
the alumni of the University are_ alive
to’the fact that they are clever singers
and arrange to have them present at the
annual banquet of the Alumni Associa-
tion. V
Keep up the good work, fellows!‘

Annual Meeting of General
Alumni Association
At the meeting held in room 302_ Thaw
Hall on the evening of February Zﬂth,
President Hamilton presented a report
on progress made during ‘the past year.
Special attention/was called to the good
work, of the Employment Bureau and
Publicity Committee, for both of which
Mr. K. E. Davis had rendered valuable.
Favorable comment was made

Board on Student Activities, the ﬁnanc-

'ing «of the Pitt Weekly and 1914 Owl

having been given as examples, Dur-
ing the year -the election by—laws had
been modiﬁed, and a life membership
plan adopted (fee $25.00). Reference
was made to the very successful ban-
quets held in February and June of
last’yea.r. Thecommittee on new stu-
dents had reported constant increase
in attendance and stated that new build-
ings were necessary to accommodate
them. . '

Secretary Silverman reported on the
-organization meeting of the National
Intercollegiate Association of Alumni
Secretaries held at Columbus, 0., Feb-
ruary 21st and 22nd. He spoke of work
done. in other institutions, especially
and _ Columbia,
which have been very active alumni
bodies and which employ
who devote their entire time to alumni
work. So that he might devote his en-
tire’ time to the Department of Chem-
istry and that the association might
progress as rapidly ‘as possible, _,Pro—
fessor Silverman, though elected secre-
tary for another year,‘ recommended that
a secretary be appointed who shall "give
his entire time, who shall have arters
on the. campus, visit and organi. ‘the
alumni, take charge of an alumni pub-
lication, create a strong co-operation be-
tween‘ the Alumni and the University,
and in every way possible strengthen
Alumni interests. This recommendation
was favorably received and ordered
taken up for consideration at the next
Alumni Council meeting, March 17th.

;The following change in the constitu-
tion was also recommended for consid-
eration by the Council: .

Article II, Section 3, to .read:.“Ahy
graduate of the University of Pitts-
burgh (or former Western »University
of Pennsylvania) may be elected a reg-
ular member of the General Alumni As-
sociation on» written application ap-
proved by the signatures of a ,ma'ority
of the six regular councilors from his de-
partment, and on ‘payment -the dues.”
Section 4 (Associate mem ens)
modiﬁed in the same manner.

Permanent Secretary Assured.
‘Since the annual meeting was held
one of the University’s prominent
alumni has secured an amount sufficient

.to ﬁnance the plans of the association

for the ﬁrst Year and promises to raise
an endowment .fund to permanently care
for its ‘needs, over and above amounts
secured through paymen‘t of dues. This
is undoubtedly -the greatest step for-
ward ever taken in alumni circles. ’

. Alumni Gouncillvleeting‘.

The next regular meeting of the
Alumni Council will be held in room 302
Thaw Hall (Engineering building),
Monday, March 17th, at 8 P. M. it is
hoped that every member of Council
willﬂattend, as many very inri ortant
matters will be considered. t this
meeting the Chairman of Council is
elected for the ensuing year.

Thaw Hall, March 1, 1913.
Lawrence Boggs,
Editor‘of The Pitt Vveekly, —
University of Pittsburgh.
Dear Sir: _ -

I desire to call the attention of the
students and faculty to the attitude as-_
sumed by thenl in regard to two of ;the
most’ important events in the school
year, the Junior “Prom”
versary Celebration.

Last week every student was ordered

by his dean to take part in the parade,
preceding the exercises, about one-third

of the students were there. The result
was not a surprise to me, and can, be
easily explained. The Junior “Prom”
was held the previous night at the Hotel
Schenley. Did any one .hear the deans
say that there would be no classes on
Friday morning. ‘In fact, I think we
were expressly told that classes would
be held from’ 8:30 -to 12:30.

Now, no person who has danced all
night is in ﬁt condition to study pr
learn anything the next morning. The
fellows did not get home until about 5

.A.' M., and yet they either had to go -to

class or take a.‘ zero. Consequently those
who went to class in the morning were
so tired that they wenthome to rest at
noon, and did not stay for the exercises.

Those who stayed home in the morning. _~
spent the afternoon.

and took a“‘zip,”
making up back work. All of these men
were loyal Pitt students, or they "would
not have been at the “Prom.” Had they
been treated fairly "by the faculty they
would have /been at the celebration.
The School of Economics‘, even went so

‘far as to_hold classes in the evening
-school while the “Prom” was going on.’

To make any university affair a success,
both students and faculty must work
together. In the future I recommend
reciprocity by both sides. - ,
Yours truly,»
A Member of the “Prom” Committee.

PITT VINDICATED - BY

PENN STATE MANAGER.

 

(Continued from Page 1)
was encountered, the ‘Pirate’ outﬁeldens
experienced great trouble owing to the
soft condition of the ground. For foot-

ball in t-he‘ fall the conditions were even ,

worse. The frost would get in the
ground, and during hard freezing
weather the ﬁeld would be so hard that
it. was actually ‘ dangerous for play.

When the sun came out, the -conditions '
might change in a few hours and the .

ﬁeld would ‘become muddy and slow.
This was the case on Thanksgiving day
of_ 1910. _The writer‘ we-ll, remembers
t 1S occasion.
in our history we were absolutely con-
ﬁdent -of idefeating‘ Pennsylvania State.
Their‘ team was slightly heavier than
ours, -especially in the b’ackﬁe1’d,, our
four men t-here consisting of Hittner,
Dewar, Brown and “Tex” Richards.

Hittner and Dewar weighed considerably"

less than-150 pounds and Brown only
162. Richards was the one big man.
Under these conditions we wanted,
above all things, a good dryﬁeld, and
in order to secure this I recall distinctly
h-ow one of the assistant.‘ coaches se-
cured a gang of .laborers to he_lp"spread
the canvas cover over the ﬁeld;-the night
before the game. ‘

“On Thanksgiving morning there was .

a Marathon race which ended at Forbes
Field, and I happened to be there be-
tween 9 and 10 o'clock. The ﬁeld was
as "hard as adamant when I arrived
around the‘ former hour. About 10
o’clock, when the sun came out, the field

' way you desire.

started to soften rapidly and I remem-
ber that my shoes were muddy when I
left -there. I recall rema.rking to At-
torney, “Bob" Kennedy of Uniontown,
Pa. (an ardent and very fair W, & J,
rooter, by the way), who was there to
see the ﬁnish of the race, that ‘This field
is going to be soft for this afternoon.’
yr. Kennedy agreed with me, and said
it was due to the frost coming out’ of
the ground. He remarked also that as
the ‘ground settled, all this trouble
would be obviated.

“After the game, when State was de-
feated 11-0, -this story was circulated.
Every year it has been springing up
around Thanksgiving time. That the
State authorities never placed any cred-
ence in it is shown by Graduate _Man-
ager Smith's letter. Right here it might
be added that Mr. Smith has shown a
true spirit of fairness in giving t-he let-
ter for publication, and in offering to
co-operate in every way to correct the.
injustice done the University. '

“The writer has this suggestion to
make to undergraduates and alumni, as
it may be that the disgruntled ‘knock-
ers’ and malcontents. who have circu-

noltwithstanding Mr.,Smith’s letter: If
you hear the story repeated by any one
call his attention immediately to Mr.
Smith's statement. If this isn’t ac-
cepted, secure, if' possible, the name and
address of the talker and send.to‘t-he
Graduate Manager, or bring the man to
his office personally. If we cannot con-
vince him that the story is a lie, pure
‘and simple, we will admit that he is
either a lunatic or that he ‘is circulat-
ing it with malicious intent. _
“We regret to see that the falsehood
has been circulated broadcast through.
the western and central part , of the
state. Now it is up to every Pitt man
to stop it; Personal work as suggested-
will be the most effective method.”
'_‘‘Right in connection with this, I wish
to quote» a letter just received from
Frank» A. Piekarski, the former Penn and
All-American guard and later coach of
W. & J.’s football team. Piekans-ki has
always been lined up in athletics with a
rival team of Pitt’s, but his letter ‘shows
that he'is a good sportsman who likes
to see justice done at all times.‘ His

‘tion from the Graduate Manager, in
fact, ‘he has never had the pleasure of
meeting the gentleman. ‘
-“Mr; Piekarskiﬁs letter is as follows:
,“ ‘I notice by this morning’s paper
that a story was circulated that Forbes
Field has been tampered with preceding
the game with State College and that
the surface was water soaked. H-aving
heard this allegation many, many times
and being qualiﬁed to know the real
facts, I write you concerning this matter
without any solicitation, but only in the
interest of fairness. . . V
“ ‘In justice‘ to the Pitt Athletic au-
thorities, I wish to state that the ac-
cusationis unfounded and ridiculous on
its face. Any personknowing the con-
ditions of the weather a.nd soil In this
vicinity during the ‘month of November
can very readily see thecau-se of the
slippery condition of the ﬁeld. The frost
gets into the ground to the -depth of a
few inchesand the sun thaws the sur-
face, which naturally makes the slippery
condition of the field. I feel that the in-
justice, even though ridiculous, may do
an injustice to the Pitt athletic authori-
ties. You may use this opinion In any

“He dont‘» know much,” exclaimed -Di-
rector C. S. Miller when asked what ‘he
thought of Prof. Sabe’s relay selection

week. » . M

“In_ the ﬁrst place Sabe only consid-
in the‘
events at the Expo meet lately, and
this is all wrong as I could name’ three
men, off ‘hand: that will push his -se-
lected ﬁve mighty hard .on the cinder
track next month. These men are work-
ing out daily on, the indoor track in_
Trees gym and theirltraining will tell
late in _April at the relay trials. .

"There is not one man out for the
team that will have a cinch’ in taking
first place, as there is enough class
shown by ten candidates to warrant a
stiff pace all the way. Perhaps,’the
learned Prof. can tell us the timeythat
will win this event.” 1 _

Trainer Hunter Johnson. was also dis-
pleased over Prof. Sabe’s selection.
Said Hunter: “You nevercan tell-about
these track men so early in the season.
This Sabe man made a. pretty fair guess
but he left out one of- my football stars

who will make ’em all travel next
April. ’ , -~
“Polly?” he returned with ‘a broad

smile when questioned. “Course

way!”

expenditures in football were $41,977.73.
This includes amounts paid visiting

cost of training house, salaries of
coaches, etc.

No sport at the Uniyersity was con-
ducted at’ a proﬁt during the season. The
receipts from baseball were

$389.65, and from the sale of student
books, which admit the holders to all
athletic contests at the University, $4,-

After watching his'pupils perform in

test, Prof. G. W. Postgate expressed
satisfaction _at'the form they showed

The fencing team left for Annapolis
last night to take part in the prelim-

inary matches of the Eastern Interc_ol‘- -

evening. The men who made the trip
were Capt. W. E. Gray, Bernard and
Roney as regulars, and Larson as sub-
stitute. The teams in the southern sec‘-

Pitt, Princeton, Navy and Pennsylvania,
while the northern section includes Cor-

gnell, Yale, Columbia and Harvard, and
iwill stage their preliminaries

in New

THE PITT ‘WEEKLY

"GRAND

 

The day of our great rea.liza,ti.on of
our great expectation is almost upon us
-——for talking motion pictures, the'Kinet-
ophone, most wondrous of all the near-
rniracle inventions of the wizard of
Menlo Park, Thomas A. ‘Edison, are to
have their initial exhibition in Pitts-
burgh in the Grand’s vaudeville show
on next Monday afternoon, March 10,
and thereafter each afternoon and even-
ing for one week. That the Grand’s
capacity will be tested as it has never
been tested before is a conclusion which
one may arrive at ,without the aid of
the gift of prophecy, for wherever one
goes in Pittsburgh nowadays -one"ﬁnds
nothing but the coming of the- talking
of the ‘talking motion pictures ‘upper-
most in the public mind. The pictures
area tremendous success. New York,
Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis and
Cleveland, the only cities in which they
have been exhibited thus far, acclaim

them the realization -of the c-ountry’s '

dream and pronounced their synchron-
ism so perfect and their re-alizati_on so
effective as to be almost uncanny. The

selection of‘ subjects is wiisely designed .

not only to entertain, but to show the
scope and possibility -of this nearest
miracle that has come from the ‘labora-

' tory of the world's, wonder worker. In

the beginning, one sees and hears upon.
the canvas the perfect illusion -of a well-
groomed lecturer. explaining with ges-
tures, in well chosen words and keenly
intellectual facial expression, the tech-
nical methods by which Mr. Edison ar-
rived at his invenution—a technical lec-
ture, as it were, in non—techn1cal terms
with actual demonasitraitions of breaking
plates with their accompanying din, of
1'u1l—toned, sweet-voiced muscial instru-
ments and of every vocal and physical
sound to which the human ears are ac-
customed. ‘
