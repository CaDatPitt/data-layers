During his first year- at Pitt,

Steve gained a-berth on the cheer-

— for-three years. At the end of last

year he succeeded Jay Garber as

During Spring Carnival last se-

clever. imitation ;of Johnny Ray
as he gave his vocal cords for his
fraternity, Lambda Chi Alpha.
Under his guise of the ever
snarling puma,_ Steve has per-
formed such feats as gaining a
place for the Panther as the most

  The Wrong Idea,  

As much, as we would like to see a successful pep
rally we cannot agree with the: method being tried today
in an attempt ‘to insure its success. Student Congress,
through the efforts of Paul Petro, has approved a plan to
picket the Tuck, Shop and thereby force students to the
rally. _ * '

This amounts to coercion and cannot be applauded-.
Students 'who heed the‘ pickets and go to the rally will
merely: add to the size of the crowd, and the success of a
‘pep rally is not based. on volume or the amount of noise.
-The real goal is to inspire and encourage the team to win.

In the past few years we have seen a gap form be-

tween the team and the students. No longer is it a “win

or lose it’s still our team” attitude. Instead the team has
to winevery game or they’re a bunch of burns who need
a new coach. This isn’t school spirit and neither is" the jingle

“of money in the stadium till when we’re riding the crest with

.a Winning team. , _
School spirit comes spontaneously and stays with a ‘good
team and sticks» with a losing one. If Pitt wanted to win

every game they could play inferior teams, but we’re play-

. ing the best so we’ll have to accept loses. Not anticipate
. them, .just accept them.

y-Appeals should be made to the student’s sense of pride,

not‘ to the shame he might feel if found in the Tuck Shop

during the fourth hour. Try other methods, but leave the
picketing to the unions. " ,

results of the survey will be published Oct. 5 in
book form. The researchers were concerned with

. the answers to four questions which they asked

of 16,000 students from 27 colleges throughout the
country. .

On the basis of the interviews,
the researchers have discovered
that approximately 74 per cent
of the college students in the
United States drink to some ex-
tent. The other 26 per cent said
they have always abstained.
Twice as many women abstain as
men. Interestingly enough, these
ﬁgures coincide with the percent- ’ '- «
age that has been reached in some estimates of
adult drinking in the U. S. as a whole. These ﬁg-
ures were_ also inﬂuenced by such factors as reli-

 

‘ gion, family income, and national origin. Students

from lower income families reported a lower per-
centage-of drinkers as did those of- certain reli-
gious sects and nationalities. , I

The survey went on to report that students drank
beer, wine, and ‘spirits” in varying amounts. After

— this amazing statement, they proceeded to give

meaningless hnd very general percentages of drink-
ers for the different types of alcohol. Consumption
at "one sitting was grouped under incomplete per-
centages. Wine drinkers, at least 95 per cent of them,

said they consumed four glasses or less at one sit- _

ting. Four bottles of beer or less was classed as
“medium” consumption and the general practice of
90 per cent of the drinkers. '

Getting down to hard liquor separated the men’

from the boys and 93 per cent of the women and
71 per cent of the men said they consumed three
or fewer drinks at one sitting. Forty—three per cent
of the men and 53‘ per cent of the women said they
drank no more than once a month. Only 21 per

Applications Unchanged . . .

 

Drinking Survey Proves Little i

cent of the men and 10,per cent of the women drink
oftener than once a week. .

Men turned out to begthe beer drinkers when‘
only seven per cent said they drank wine and 21
per cent preferred spirits. The rest of them were
satisﬁed with beer. Women came out for spirits by
43 per cent and. 41 per cent for beer. Only 16 pe

cent most frequently had wine. *

Social custom was the reason given by .most of
the students for their reason for drinking but a few
admitted thatthey enjoyed it. - Most of them also

‘pointed out that they referred to college social

custom only partially.
One good point that should be- mentioned is the

fact that four-ﬁfths of the Inenvand two—thirds of’

the women said they had their first drinks before

' entering college. See Mom, I told you so! Littlei

Johnny won’t pick up any bad habits at collegeuthat
he hasn’t learned already; And chances are good,
acording to the. survey, that the ﬁrst drink was
taken in the’ student’s own home.

Summing up the results of the survey,_the gen-
eral opinion of the experts was that the popular-
myth of wild college drink is dead _and I that stu-
dents drink moderately and according‘ to custom.
This must have taken a lot of ﬁguring and much
expert evaluation of the report. Frankly, there-

port doesn’t prove a thing except that somebody’

went ot a lot of trouble to talk to a lot of people
in a lot of places. Couched in general terms, and
inadequately considering a fantastic number of
possibilities and sidelights, the report will be of
no more consequence than the‘ second half of the
book which deals with the relationship of drink-
ing and sex conduct. _ _, .

‘In fact if we are to believe and abide by these
ﬁgures, it’s going to take about six weeks of .solid

drinking to catch up with the rest of the crowd. The‘.

simplest thing to do is forget about the statistics
and go on living on the status quo. ' We’re probably
normal‘ with having to plow through all those per-
centages to prove it. '

Discrimination Still¥ Present ‘

R By Elinore Stone
The Philadelphia Fellowship Commission re-
ported recently that application forms of 60 , per

cent of Pennsylvania’s 122 institutions of higher~

learning carry "potentially discriminatory ques-

‘ tions.” '

This means that 73.2 or the state's colleges and

_ professional schools still use application forms ask-

ing the student’s race, religion
or nationality, or require pho-
tographs. ‘

Race, religion and national
origin are not legitimate criteria
for admission of students. I’m
glad to report that Pitt’s forms e
do not ask the applicant’s race
or religion. As to national or-
igin, however,. the University
procedure is questionable.

Instead of asking for the nationality, present
Pitt formsrequest the applicant’s country of birth

and mother tongue. This is perhaps necessary

but I haven’t’, been able to find out why. .
Still more mysterious is the asking of the moth-
er’s maiden name, her country of birth if not

II, and many others,’ see no reason for these
questions being included on aquestionnaire theo-

bearing can the mother's maiden -name or ,father’s
nationality have .on the. admission or rejection of
an applicant. to Pitt? ,_ « up

’ The_ individual should be considered on the
basis of his qualities only’ and if the other infor-
mation:is desirable, as perhaps it is, why not col-
lect it once the student is registered?

Acting unanimously. through the Association -of
College and Universities, the schools of "Pennsyl-
vanj,a.in October V1949, rejected race, religion and
national origin as criteria for admitting students.
According to the -Fellowship Commission’s_ report,
however, only 40 per cent ‘of them ask their ap-
plicants no potentially‘discriminatory questions.

“Signiﬁcantly,” it added, “the 40 per cent whose
application formsare ‘non-discriminatory’ include
some. of th'e,state’s largest institutions and’ all. of
the state teachers colleges, and'if they do not need
this type of information before admitting students,
we see no reason why - other schools need it."
And as to Pitt, neither do I. i ’

Gadl! That horrible phrase

year with a string of what his
cronies call failures and an over-
dose of discouragement with the
student body, distrust of the ad-

If such a judgement, of true "

school spirit is a valid one, then
the graying temples and torn
locks of assemblies chairmen are
worth the trouble. It is the sus-

that the whole idea of what Stu-

school spirit is off base.

The days of the raccoon coat

are trying to make a constructive
effort in approaching the real idea
of a university education.”

Last year, the group undertook
Dante’s “Divine Comedy.” Aver-
aging between 20 to 25 attendance
for each meeting, members read
Dante’s opus after a reading "in
Italian by Ferdinanda Invrea,
former graduate student in litera-
ture from Genoa, Italy. At another
meeting, history professor George
B. Fowler spoke on historical"
backgrounds of Dante’s period. ‘

Begun in January, 1953, the
club’s policy states that f‘it is-the

Dr. John Hayes, a returned
prisoner of- the_ Chinese Com-
munists, gave an informal break-
fast talk to Pitt students on Wed-
nesday in the Red Tuck Shop.

Dr. Hayes, an ordained Presby-
terian minister, was graduated
from Woosley College and at-
tended Princeton as a seminary
student. -

Sent to China as a missionary,
he was asked to leave when the
Communists took over. He re-
fused. Shortly after, he was ar-
rested and accusedof spying for
the “capitalists” because of a let-
ter he’ wrote home which revealed
his feeling that Gen. MacArthur
had the intention of ” bombing
Manchuria.

Red Regard Ha.y'es as
Information Source

The. day after the letter was
sent, ‘MacArthur was recalled
from his command. The Reds

serves the original, ‘purpose for
which any university was found-
ed——to help students establish
values through intimate acquaint-
ance with the humanities, the
arts, the natural sciences, the so-
cial sciences, and religion.”
Latin Motto Guides Group

The club’s motto, in Latin, is:
“Homo sum humani nihil a me
alienum puto.” Roughly translat-
ed, this expresses the inter-re1a-
tionship between men. The famous
quotation from John Donne says
it in these words:

“No man is an island ,entire.of
itself; every man is a piece of the
continent, a part of the main; if
a clod be washed away by the sea,

valuable sougce of information to
inﬂuence the U. S. government.
As a result, he was placed under
house guard for a year. 4%.

He was imprisoned from June

thought that Dr. Hayes must be a»

1951 to December 1952. Among-

Torturous Qllestionings
Led To A Confession
Says Ex-Red Captive

the tortures that he experienced
was a continuous questioning per-
iod (sometimes for nine hours at
a time) in a “court” comprised of
only a prosecutor and judge. The
technique of the communistsvwas
to prevent the prisoners from
getting sleep _ and feeding them
only enough food to keep alive.

Dr. Hayes said that “a ﬁrm
hold on his Christian faith and
trying to recognize his persecutors
as individuals under God rather
than as enemies kept him from ad-
-mitting their accusations.

Doctor Signs ‘Face-Saving’
‘Confession

His release ﬁnally came about
when he signed a watered-down
confession, a familiar"face-saving
device utilized by the Commu-
nists. . -

The doctor, whose speech was
sponsored by the YMCA, is now
traveling throughout the United
States relating his experiences to
college students, religious and
civic groups.

Europe is the less, as well as if
a promontory were; ‘any man’s

Club is open to all students and
faculty. Freshman woman may
participate through the Humani-

Paradise or Hell

Last year, while the group was
reading Dante’s “Divine Comedy,”
the gibe was jokingly spread
through school that “if you want
to go through Hell, join the Hu-
manities Society,” since» Dante’s
work starts out in Hell.

“But, as anyone knows who
stayed through the entire semes-
ter,” smiles Sam Seigle,’ “he winds
up in Paradise.”

...Wilkinson’s Record

0 o 0 I
High 1n 7 Seasons
0 By CARROLL COOK _-
Until last Saturday, crafty, aifable Bud Wilkinson was

‘ the Winningest coach in collegiate football and, although his —
Oklahoma team lost to Notre Dame, 28-21, the former Minne-

sota star still owns a record which is only a few percentage

_ poihts behind Frank Leahy’s.

Since Wilkinson became head coach at Oklahoma in
1947 his teams have won 54, lost eight and tied two. Two
of these defeats were to Notre Dame and one was to,Ken-
tucky, 13-7, in the Sugar Bowl, the ﬁrst setback for the Soon-
ers in 31 games, a modern collegiate record.

The Sooners, owners of a high—power offense, have
scored at least three touchdowns¢ .
in the last 18 games. ‘In 1951, ' 
Texas held the Sooners to seven
points, and the week before, the
Texas Aggies whipped Oklahoma,
14-7. This was the only time a
Wilkinson team has lost two games
in a row. The Oklahoma_ athletic
committee thought so highly of
Wilkinson’s work that it awarded
him a ten-year contract, which
still has nine years left. ‘

Always Top Ten
During the last ﬁve: years, Okla-
homa has won every football hon-
or possible, including a national

wins, and ﬁfteen All-Americans;
In 1949 Wilkinson was named
“Coach of the Year” by his fel-
low colleagues. Thesooners have’
also been ranked as one of the
ten top teams in nearly every poll
during this period of time. Okla-
homa also owns the best ﬁve-year
record of any college in the coun-

tr)’. .

coaching of Bernie Bierman. In
1934, Wilkinson was a member of
the Minnesota team which licked

call “one of the ten greatest games

ever played.” Minnesota was na-.

tional champion in 1934 and 1936.
In the latter year, Bierman switch-

Aside from this afternoon’s scheduled practice, Coach
Carl Olson’s Panther harriers~hav‘e completed their condi-
tioning and are prepared to run for keeps in their home op-
ener against Geneva tomorrow at 10:30 am. in Schenley

Park.

Geneva’sC Covies, with one meet already under their belts,

are bringing a formidable squad headed by their ace, George
Jackson, who placed ﬁrst against Slippery Rock last week.
Despite J ackson’s performance the Rockets edged, the Covies

- 20-47. '

Tabbed for Pitt starting assignments are: Co-captains

DelliGatti and Dan Sommer, Walt¢

Starz, Bob Cherry, Allen Gunder-
son, Ron Sallade and Pete Kress-.
Until Olson pin-pointed him yes-
terday, Kress fought hard with
Church Wivell for- the seventh
slot.
Besides starting. the seven men
‘who make up the ﬁrst string,
Olson hopes to obtain‘ permis-
sion from Covie Coach’ Robert
Park to ‘run the entire squad-in
tomorrow’s test. '

By running the harrier squad as
a Whole, Olson ﬁgures he can pick
out the stronger of the non—start-
ers and thereby might move some
of them up to a varsity berth in
the upcoming Oct. 8 meet with
Westminster.

switched from Schenley Park

Defense Secondary .
Wilkinson, who prefers the
one-platoon to the free ‘substitu-
tion rule, was assistant coach at
Syracuse, ,Minnesota, Iowa Pre-
Flight and ﬁnally _Oklahoma be-
fore becoming head man six years

‘ ago. Wilkinson has already help-

ed revolutionize football with the
famous Split-T. He believes that
defense is secondary, and by look-
ing at the scores it is evident that
he practices what he preaches.

Ten years ago, Oklahoma, along
with Michigan State and Mary-
land, was just another football
team. However, all this has
changed and two of these teams,
the Sooners and Terrapins, use the
Split-T. Jim Tatum, loquacious
Maryland coach, was the head
coach at Oklahoma before Bud
took over. I "

Wide Open Game

Together, these two men have
practically changed the offensive
game.

Wilkinson believes in speed,
fast linemen, and the ability to
score from any part of the ﬁeld.

The Sooners are very dangerous

on-punt and kickoff returns. In
Buddy Leake, Sooner quarterback,
Oklahoma has a back who is as
apt to run 80 yards as he is ﬁve.
Although the Sooners lost the ball
35 times on fumbles in 1948, which
is a record, they still managed to
win ten games while losing one.

Wouldn’t it be a ﬁne thing if “athletes took that same

the good of sports, they don’t; nor does the greater ‘part of

any student body giveup on the basis of one performance.
But this .morning is a good. chance to show the team and
the University that you feel-like Red Dawson did last Sat-
urday when he said that ‘there are -eight games left. .
Pitt lost”to a good footballteam last Saturday—one that
was highly underrated and caught the Panthers before. they

were ready. All Daws,on’s‘boys need is evidence of steady

And speaking of the rally, you just can’t pass up the

O opportunity to see one of Pitt_f_§. ﬁnest personalities in action.

Our genial friend Dr. H. C. (Heaven’s Gherub) Carlson will
bend his inimitable personality to the office of master of
ceremonies. The man’s joviality and subtle (usually) wit is
assurance of an hour well spent. (Al, Conan Doyle will

' probably thank mefrom-the bottom of/his grave for refrain-

ing from using his monstrous cliche, -“the good doctor” in

reference to the good doctor.)

notl to.miss is the operation of the Split—T, a la Southwest

This Buddy Leake, who runs the plays for Oklahoma,
handles the offense in true cowboy fashion, judging from the
tales of scouts and other observers. According to Dawson,
Leake is even better than last year’s -quarterback, Eddie
Crowder, ~who some claim got the snub of! the year in 1952
when All-America selections rolled in. l

_ S _ A Leake Drawing Card
_ Of course, Leake may look better in the absence of Billy
Vessels and Buck McPhail,, Crowder’s horse , but fans who
go to the Stadium tomorrow will see plenty o fancy quarter-
back.ing from a real college star. I

.Wait! Don’t count the Panthers outalready. Remember
the last time they were underdogs Notre Dame..1952. Some-
times, being on the short end of the odds does something to
a team. ‘Football players, subject to varying degrees of tem-
perature and pressure in the fall, have the wholesome knack
of making liars. out of "bookies at times. But, unfortunately,

Vvalking away from the ruins
of his ﬂying saucer, the tiny
creature opened his, emergency
skit. Peering into it with his .
, middle eye, he beheld a stack of -I»
greenbacks, packs of chewing gum, and a sheet of instructions A
- which read: "In this kit you will ﬁnd everything you need
to live as a college student. All college men wear clothes and
chew gum. Buy clothes, chew gum constantly...and good
luck!" I ’

Scratching his left antenna with his lower left hand, he
tore off halfof a ﬁve dollar bill, popped it into his mouth,
and scuttled into a nearby college shop. "Let's see your ﬁnest
shirt," he squeaked. . '

The trembling clerk handed him a Van Heusen Oxfordian.
“Gleeps, that's really a mimsyl”, screeched the little fellow,
feeling the luxurious Oxford fabric. “How much is it?"

“Only $4.50," quavered the clerk. “I }_have them in the
smartest new colors. ..and white to boot. Plus roll collars.
button-downs ‘and new short collars."

"Only $4.50? Fantasticl", pipeddthe creature. "I’11 take

‘ one of each!” ,

Carefully he counted out twenty sticks of gum and laid
them on the counter. "Keep the change,” he chortled, put-
ting the shirts under his middle arm. And munching mer-
rily on a crisp ten dollar bill, he waddled-“out.
