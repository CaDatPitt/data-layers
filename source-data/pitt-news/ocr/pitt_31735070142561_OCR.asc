Cathedral chase scene

Police, three
others pursue a
woman through
the Commons
Room

Liz Navratil
News Editor

A chase through the Cathedral
Commons Room yesterday af-
ternoon ended in the arrest of a
woman accused of robbery, bur-
glary and assault, among other
charges.

Pitt police Chief Tim Delaney
said in an e-mail that his officers
arrested a woman not affiliated
with the University for robbery,
burglary, simple assault, theft
and receiving stolen property
— a computer —- yesterday af-
ternoon. He declined to give the
woman’s name because police
were still processing her arrest
last night. '

Pitt sophomore Natalie Grauel
said she was sitting in the Cathe-
dral Commons Room facing the
elevators between 3:30 and 3:40
p.m. yesterday when she heard
people screaming behind her.

She turned around and saw
two women and one man chasing
a woman through the Commons
Room. _

Alex Swanson, who was also
studying in the Commons Room,
said she heard the three people
chasing the woman scream, “Get
security.”

Grauel said she watched the

Boulevard side of the Cathedral.
The woman ran in circles through
the doors several times.

“I thought it was a prank. I
thought it was straight-up just
something funny going on,”
Grauel said. “I was laughing
because I didn’t know what to

do.” -
Grauel said the woman even-
tually exited the Cathedral,

‘where multiple people said they

saw officers arrest her.

. Officers took the woman to
the Fifth Avenue side of the Ca-
thedral, where they handcuffed
her and placed her in a police
car.

You might not think you know anyone who
is 100 years old, but you do.

who walked past the party were invited

Every hour, students joined the associa-

day” to Roc. About 450 _people stopped

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg came by to
congratulate Roc on his 100 years.

Since the Panther mascot was selected
by the University’s publicity committee on

presence throughoutthe community and
even around the nation.

Amanda Johnston, 2vice president of

Homecoming to da ih fireworks, lights

Homecoming weekend will start
this Friday at 9:30 p.m. with the
annual ﬁreworks and laser show,
followed by a Pitt Program Coun-
cil-sponsored Monte Carlo Night
at the Union.

The evening will begin with
ﬁreworks shooting from the Ca-
thedral. The show, a 19-year Pitt
tradition, is organized by Zam-
belli Fireworks and will include
lasers and music. The University
will shut down Bigelow Boulevard
between Forbes and Fifth avenues
to accommodate an audience.

Immediately following the
show, the Kurtzman Roo°m in the
Union will be decorated like the
Las Vegas strip, with card and ca-
sino games for students and par-
ents to enjoy. At the end of the
night, Pitt Program Council will
raffle prizes for participants.

Jillian Reilly, the council’s
special events coordinator, said
she has high hopes for this week-
end. _

“This year, we are making the

Activities on Saturday will
start three hours before kickoff
the Homecoming football game
against South Florida at Heinz

Field. The University announced 

that the World’s Largest Block Par-
ty, a Chicago-based festival that
travels to various cities, will take
over Art Rooney Avenue between
Gates A and B, featuring live en-.
tertainment, food and activities,
including a giant video wall and
inflatable games for kids.

Two hours before the game
starts, the Pitt Panther Prowl is
sponsoring a meet-and-greet with
Pitt football players as they arrive
outside of Gate A. Then, the Pitt
marching band will take the ﬁeld
for the pregame concert. It will
lead the March to Victory Parade,
which will follow General Robin-
son Street and end at Art Rooney
Avenue. The Homecoming court
will also march in the parade,

It’s now unclear whether or not Luke Raven-
stahl will debate at_ Pitt Sunday.

The mayor’s campaign led people to be-
lieve that Mayor Luke Ravenstahl would at-
tend its event for the mayoral candidates on

SGB event

Each candidate will speak on stage by him— '

self. There will be no opportunity for rebuttal
or question-and-answer periods.

“We don’t want it to be an extremely long A

event because we wanted people to stay for
the whole time,” Trainer said.

He said the candidates’ schedules also
impose time restraints. However, the board
reserved the room’ until 9 p.m.

Sunday.

Nick Trainer, the SGB governmental rela-
tions committee chair, announced at Tuesday
night’s SGB meeting that Ravenstahl and the
independent candidates Franco Dok Harris
and Kevin Acklin agreed to attend the event
and give speeches catering to student con-
cems.

“Ravenstahl’s camp had conﬁrmed, how-
ever [he] has since unconﬁrmed due to a busy
schedule. It is a possibility that he will still
attend the event; however, they are in the
process of moving things around,” Trainer
said. »

Committee member Whitney McNamara

. said she has been in contact with the Raven-

stahl campaign. All she could say was that
Ravenstahl did not cancel.

Ravenstahl’s campaign manager, Paul
McKrell, said that he’s the only person who
would have conﬁrmed that the mayor would
attend, and he did not.

Trainer said candidates will have 20 to 30
minutes to deliver a stump speech directed to
students in David Lawrence Hall rooms 120
and 121. The event begins at 7 p.m.

Before each candidate speaks, Trainer will

read a brief, “nonpolitical,” resume-style bi- g

ography of each candidate which their cam-
paigns prepared. A

Trainer said that he’s done some advertis-
ing through Facebook and e—mailed politically
active student groups.

Ravenstahl, the former city council presi-
dent, became mayor after Mayor Bob O’Connor
passed away unexpectedly in 2006.

He attended North Catholic High School

in the North Side and graduated from Wash— ,

former Pittsburgh Steeler Franco Harris. He
majored in politics at Princeton University

Pro—Pa|estinian group takes stage with message

Erin Block
For The Pitt News

Rachel Corrie stood as one of the links in a
makeshift human forceﬁeld. In six or seven
seconds, her life was taken by an Israeli De-
fense Forces bulldozer. The bulldozer ran
her over twice, and her efforts to save local
Palestinian citizen Samir Nasrallah’s home
abruptly cameto an end.

Stories of untimely conﬂicts between the
Israelis and Palestinians are frequent because
of the constant conﬂict in the Middle East.
Corrie’s story, however, is unique because it
will be expressed through a theatrical debut at
a Students forjustice in Palestine conference
this weekend, entitled “Boycott, Divestment
and Sanctions against Israel.”

The conference, which runs today through
Sunday, focuses on building and enhanc-
ing the boycott, divestment and sanction,
or BDS, movement on Pitt’s campus. Other
participants in the conference include the
U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation,
Hampshire Students for Justice in Palestine
and Pittsburgh Palestine Solidarity Commit-
tee. I

The conference touches on a controversial
topic not just in the Middle East, but also here
on campus.

Panthers for Israel, Pitt’s pro—Israel orga-
nization, does not agree with the conference’s
message.

Chelsea Zimmerman, vice president
of Panthers for Israel, said the conference
doesn’t promote equality between the two
sides of the Israeli—Palestinian conflict

Each day of the conference is divided into
several sections and includes workshops dur-
ing which participants will learn about the
BDS movement and the actors involved. To-
night’s opening eventwillfeature Palestinian-
American poet and presenter Remi Kanazi. On
the ﬁnal day of the conference, attendees will
immerse themselves in a theatrical production
of “My Name is Rachel Corrie.”

The BDS movement, according to Courtney
Nassar of the Pittsburgh Palestine Solidarity
Committee, is a successful, non-violent meth-
od used to gain justice in South Africa, which
“brings justice and equality to all peoples.”

The method involves creating pressure
from foreign actors on the Israeli government,
Nassar said. The intent of the strategy is to
end the Israeli occupation in Gaza and the
West Bank and what Palestinian activists call
human rights abuses of their people.

She said that boycotting Israeli products
is one of the ways the Students forjustice in
Palestine plan to effect change in a non-violent
manner. Thereare three types of boycotting
that can promote the cause: cultural, con-
sumer and academic.

This past February, Students forjustice in
Palestine, along withother pro-Palestinian
groups, used a  boycott method when

\. «s 1. LV, '1» 9. M w, L. t._ 6. f. v, 6 2» 4.. r 2- 9. 'v-  I}; I. 4. <l—

the exclusively Israeli Batsheva Dance Com-
pany preformed in Pittsburgh.

The conference stresses consumer boycot-
ting. Jaffa, a popular variety of Israeli orange
and frequent export to the United States, is
one product which Students for Justice in
Palestine and its supporters are targeting. The
conference’s graphic features ablood-smeared
orange slice with the slogan, “Don’t squeeze
ajaffa. Crush the Occupation.” Speciﬁcally,

Nassar said, it represents the “blood of the
Palestinians. If you buy ajaffa Orange, you
are buying into the Israeli occupation of Pales-
tine.” She said that in 2003, Palestinians called
on the United States to implement the boycott
and divestment strategy nationwide.
Nassar said the occupation affects Pales-
tinian human rights. Palestinians are losing
their homes and jobs, and 11,000 prisoners
and refugees are being held in Palestine or

Israel, she said.

Nassar said a wall was built in 1967 to di-
vide the Palestinians from the Israelis, which
created checkpoints where Palestinians and
their supporters are searched before entering
into Israeli territory, where their land and jobs
exist. Nassar experienced these “human rights
violations” ﬁrsthand when she traveled to
Israel for a month and visited the West Bank
as a Palestinian supporter.

Roc ﬂexes muscles, schmoozing skills

Roc<4

V why the University was the first school

to use one as its mascot, according to the
athletic department’s website.

Even though Roc’s jersey varies with
each sport, his overall appearance remains
the same. The only thing that changes is
the person inside.

Some people might wonder who the
man underneath the fur is, but as a rule
of thumb, Pitt mascots are not allowed to

reveal their identities. They must stay true
to that promise to demonstrate loyalty and
commitment to the school.

One of these men behind the fur
weighed in, saying, “Part of beinga mas-

, cot is really being a big Pitt fan, and if

you aren’t, then it’s going to show. You’ve
got to really like it and enjoy what you’re
doing.” _

And on Roc’s birthday, this passion

showed. _

Even though Roc was the celebrated
cat, it still looked like game day as he
ﬂexed his muscles and took pictures with
passing students. .

‘?It’s exciting,” first-year graduate stu-
dent Devyn Swain said. “100 years at this
University is really special. It shows the
commitment the University has to pre-
serving its great sports programs.”

Johnston, who has played an active
role in maintaining Pitt traditions, said,
“Everyone looks forward to going to Pitt
games and seeing a familiar face. Win or
lose, Roc is always there.”

This same school unity and loyalty can
be traced back to the decade when the
panther first received the name “Roc.”

In the late 1930s, during the time
known as the “Golden Age of Pitt Foot-
ball,” a player named Steve Petro was fa-
mous for his tremendous school spirit,

both on and off the ﬁeld. Best known for '

his nickname, “The Rock,” he was said to
be the foundation on which Pitt football
grew. And from this, the panther’s nam
and legacy was born. ‘

“A school mascot is good, because ev-
eryone can‘ have an entity to call their
own,” said one mascot, who was not al-
lowed to give his name. “It’s a nice symbol
for students to rally around.”

Some student attendees said the party
was a reminder how Pitt traditions before
Homecoming weekend are important.

“As a freshman, it’s really cool to be
here,’,’ student Heather Mathews said. “One
hundred years only happens once.”

Group calls for boycott

Conference 4 9

The BDS movement also calls for the Amer-
ican people to divest and know how their tax
money is distributed.

“Roughly $7 million everyday leaves the tax
payers and is given to aid the Israeli military,”
she said. ‘.‘We are funding the occupation and
need to invest our money elsewhere.”

The groups organizing this weekend’s con-
ference want the event to be about awareness.
Students and community members will learn
what products should be boycotted and the
amount of effort —— “very little,” Nassar said
— needed to help the cause.

Pitt students and Pittsburgh community
members “just need to show up and educate
themselves,” Nassar said. r

Nassar said she wants students and com-
munity members to know that the groups
involved with the conference have problems
with the Israeli government, not with the
Israeli people.

— Zimmerman said she’s concerned about
the point of View that the conference will
express.

“My issue with this conference is that -

the only [country] it’s pointing ﬁngers at is
Israel,” Zimmerman said. 5‘If it were a con-
ference calling on all countries who haven’t
done their part, that would be one thing, but
the fact that they are targeting Israel is what
I have a problem with.”

Zimmerman said that the average Israeli
person wants peace just as muchas the aver-
age Palestinian person. ‘ e

“No one is denying that there is a hu-
manitarian crisis involving the Palestinian
people in Israel,” Zimmerman said. “If this
conference were to help the Palestinians in
need, I would have no problem with that,
but it’s not.”

Further, she said she’s concerned that she
hasn’t heard Students forjustice in Palestine
mention anything about Hamas, a known
Palestinian terrorist group against the Israeli
occupation, or the suicide bombings Palestin-
ians have committed against Israel.

Zimmerman said that the divestment
and boycotting plan is “lofty” and that an
ideal starting point would be to look at the
Palestinian leadership. and its deprivation
of their people..

“Money donated by the U.N. [to Palestin-
ians leaders] is put towards corrupt ideals by
corrupt leadership, which fosters hatred,”
Zimmerman said. a

The Panthers for Israel are worried that
this conference will give students and com-
munity members the wrong idea.

The protests which Students forjustice
in Palestine hosted make some Panthers for

Israel members uncomfortable.

“Yes, they’re just standing there and not
doing anything illegal, but they’re meant to
elicit emotion. Posters of dead Palestinians
draw attention and are inﬂammatory propa-
ganda. I feel helpless,” Zimmerman said. ,

Zimmerman said she urges Pitt students
to take an in-depth look at both sides.

“Look at both sides, do your research,
know what sources are reputable and search
them out,” she said.

Georgetown University .

sophomore Charley Cooper just
couldn’t manage the everyday
rigors of laundry, car care and
keeping his closet clean.

So he logged onto the Uni-
versity’s student employment
website in search of a personal
assistant to hire.

He’s offering $10-$12 an hour.
Cooper’s request seems exces-

includes ‘a butler.

Finally, a way for us to prop-

Student buzz kill

School officials from Foxbor—

derage drinking by allowing the
use of Breathalyzers to test stu-
dents at dances, extracurricular

events and even during regular .

school day hours if there’s any
suspicion of alcohol use.

Now, students will have to
ﬁnd a way to sneak water in their
vodka bottles.

Police persistence

During Wednesday’s mayor-
al debate, all three candidates
promised to better support the
police department.

This is exactly what Pitt stu-
dents have been demanding for
weeks: an increased police pres-

Don’t go shopping when youcan goGoodwi|| hunting

Katie Azzara
For The Pitt News

   
 

If you are even somewhat aware of
the current fashion scene, you know
that vintage is in. Fashion constantly
builds upon itself; borrowingideas ﬁom

. the past and reinventing trends from

previous decades, and authenticvintage
clothing is what every style-conscious
person wants to wear right now.

It’s interesting, it’s unique and, best
of all, it’s cheap —_— or so it used to be.
Formerly inexpensive vintage bou-
tiques and shops have begun to raise
their prices, thus eliminatingone ofthe

‘ chiefbeneﬁts ofpurchasingpre-owned

clothing: affordability.

By now, I’m sure you’ve heard that ~

the economy sucks, and if you’re read-
ingthis,you’re mostlikelyapoorcollege
student with limited ﬁmds to spend
on shopping, much less on clothes

that aren’t even new. To get your ﬁx of
vintage threads at outrageously low
prices, shop at Goodwill. Or The Sal-
vation Army. Or any other donation
center or thrift store that you come
across, for that matter. But Goodwill
is my favorite.

Before you write Goodwill off as
a place to shop for cheap Halloween
costumes and inexpensive ﬁirniture

for your ﬁrst apartment, allow me to '

explain the abundance of other awe-
some things it has to offer.

Istartedto shop at Goodwillforthe
incomparably low prices, but I stayed
for the sense of accomplishment I felt
after diggingtl1rough racks upon racks
of clothing to ﬁnd the perfect addition
to my wardrobe.

Iremember myﬁrsttrue score from
Goodwill. Itwas ablack sequined shift
dresswithalabelofabrandthatl didn’t
recognize. Yetitwas almostidenticalto
designer dresses being sold in depart-

ment stores atthe time. Fromthen on, '

I was hooked.

My nextperfectﬁndwas anincred-
ible Chanel look—alike black bag with a
long chain strap and quilted exterior.

Some of my other favorite discover— ,

ies have included an interesting ﬂoral
dolman sleeve top, a black shirt with
neckline cutouts and the perfect pair
of brown lace-up booties. None of
these exquisite items cost more than
$10, andlpurchased most ofthem for
under $5. _

Another thing that I love about

. Goodwillisthatinsomeways,itforces

a sense of style upon the consumer. In
order to illustrate this point, consider
this: Anyonecango into astorelikeUr—
ban Outﬁtters, randomly pull an outﬁt
offthe rack and come outlookinggood.
The same can deﬁnitely notbe said fo
G00dW1ll.° ‘
Remember that Goodwill is ﬁill
of all kinds of rejected and ill—ﬁtu'ng

clothing, so not every item in the store
is goingto beaspecial piece. Also, keep
in mind that not every article can re-
allybeconsidered “vintage” inthe true
sense ofthe word. Most of the clothing
is only afewyears, or even seasons, old.
Weeding out the worthy clothes from
the junk is areally greatway to develop
an individual sense of style.

Thrift store shopping is not for ev-
eryone. If you’re concerned with labels
and designers, you should probably
seek your vintage ﬁx elsewhere. But
personally, I love that Goodwill doesn’t

distinguishbetween high—end designer

.Moschino and Targetbrand Mossimo.

Atopisatop,adressisadressanda
purse is a purse. At Goodwill, they’re
all about the same price regardless of
the name on the label. _

In the midst of my vigorous and
meticulous hunt for clothing, I some
times forgetthatwhatI’m actually doing
is helping out a great cause. The store

iscalledGoodwillforareason—be—
cause all of the money that it makes
goes toward funding programs which
provide job training and placement to

_ people in need.

Ifyoulookatitthisway, shoppingat
Goodwill is a win—win situation: You’re
helping those in need and at the same
time addingunique items to your ward-
robe.

The Goodwill organization would
not work if it weren’t for the generous
donations of clothing, accessories, ap-
pliances and ﬁirniture it receives on a
regular basis. The next time you clean
outyourcloset, rememberthat instead
ofthrowingaway your old clothing, you
can donate it to any Goodwill store
and beneﬁt a great cause. And if you
see some fashionable person walking
down thestreetwearingyour cast-oﬂ's,
you’ll know who to thank.

A few nights ago, while researching a topic
that included sexual references, I came upon
an article on Wikipedia that astounded me.

On the page, I read about at least 10 very
kinky things that I’ve never heard of. I didn’t
even think porn stars committed these acts.
Now, I’m not saying that I’m some Greek
goddess of sex information, but I’ve heard of
a lot of — let’s call them “diﬁ'erent” — acts

V OK, I’m sorry. I’ve heard of a lot of places _

to put it, but this is just unacceptable to me.
When I read this, I thought it was a joke. Do
people really do this? If so, I need a con-
crete example and an explanation of why it
was appealing. Hit me up with an _e-mail. If
there’s a valid argument, you win, and I might
consider moving it from the ‘,‘I’d-rather—be—

celibate—for—a-year-than-do-this” part of my ,

brain to the “As—long—as—I—never—have—to—
personally—partake-in—it” section. Anything
more is wishful thinking. ’ ~
Now, we’ve all heard of other crazy sexual
acts. I’m not saying that these acts are com-

So it was a surprise to see such an array ,

need to know the proper ground rules when
it comes to trying anything a little adventur-
ous. Here are a few rules by which to live:

Always ask ﬁrst.
As cliché as itlsounds, communication

is key. If it’s a new experienceabetween the
two of you, it is only appropriate (and legal,

mind you) to ask if what you are about to do ‘

is OK with the other person. i
Guys, you can’t just put it wherever you
want, whenever you want. Girls, be careful

how you touch the family j ewels. And to ev- ‘

eryone, the butt is strictly prohibited without
a thumbs—up, among several other things.

i Always be well equipped.

I am never more irate than when I hear
a story about two people who are about to

' have sex, and the guy just informs the other

personlof his lack of condoms. That’s just

unacceptable. Man up and be prepared.

No need to feed into the spread of STDs
and overpopulation. Girls, if you are going
to mess around, get on-birth, control and
then use a condom anyway. On top of that,

if you aren’t on the pill, don’t ever even think 1.
3 to lie about it. Oh, and, one more thing: If

you think lube might be necessary, then it’s
deﬁnitely necessary. I can promise that you’ll
be sorry if you don’t.

Handle with care. .

There are areas that require a certain,

shallwe say, ﬁnesse? Teeth are not favored

in these areas — this applies to both males
and females —— though a little nibbling to
the ears and neck might be OK depending
on sensitivity level. I once had a friend let a
drunken guy cross so many lines that she was
sore for a week, and all because she was too

"afraid to say something to him at the time.
‘She had to get an ointment usually reserved

for nursing mothers. You get my point.
_Shhh!

. There are several things that are not to
be mentioned when you’re fooling around or
doing the deed. First, your ex. Never mention
what he or she did, how he did it, or what you

i thought of it. Actually, just forget the ex. Any

other person’s name is an absolute no—no.a
Second, a little dirty talk goes a long way.

15

judgmental when trying something new

But unless you know that you’re both com-
pletely into it, don’t be too graphic. Some
things’ are better left unsaid.

Third, don’t be too judgmental. You would
be hurt if someone responded to your sug-
gestion with, “Ew, that’s really gross,” so just
politely say that you’re not ready for that
step if something like that comes up.

Lastly, unless’ it’s someone you know very
well, don’t talk about your period, ladies. It’s

a complete turnoff.

Have a good time, be safe, and be cour-
téous.

And remember, if you tried axillary in-
tercourse, I’ll be expecting to hear from you.
That’s one story I have to hear.

Letterlto the editor

\

To the editor,

a The Oct. V19 editorial “Parents responsible '
for children’s obesity” supporting the removal ,

of children from their parents’ custody based
on obesity. is ill-informed and ill—considered.
For anyone who has experienced the public child

welfare system, this is aludicrous response to an ’

admittedly serious physical health problem.

Removal from parental custody and place— . _
ment in a resource—poor foster care system .

virtually ensures the.inﬂicl1'on of emotional
and mental harms on children. These harms
can be devastating and can lead to very nega-
tive outcomes for children that extend well into
adulthood.

Unfortunately, the state makes a very poor
substitute parent, as is evident by conditions in
foster care. Recommendingthis course of action
in any but the most extreme cases — for which

. obesity is only an indicator of more severe par-

entingproblems — is irresponsible. The answer
in cases for which child obesity is the primary
problem is to respect attachments between a

parent and a child, avoid measures that inﬂict
lraumaticharmand provide education and other
public services that do not entail forced removal
of children from parental custody.

The bar’s walls are coated in

from the Liquor Control Board
states the establishment can’t

the basis of race. ,

at Carlow’s School of Manage-
ment. His knack for interacting
with young people is put to good
use each moment.

Ney got his bachelor’s degree
and two Master’s degrees (one in
counseling, one in English) from
Slippery Rock University before
arriving at Pitt in 1993 to pursue
his doctorate in administration
and policy studies. Owning a bar
wasn’t his original plan, but when
a Phi Kappa Theta fraternity
brother suggested he frequent a
place called Denny’s (no, not the
chain restaurant) to “meet older
chicks,” Ney’s fate was set.

He quickly made the transition
from bar regular to tenant. After
spending three years living in his
fraternity house, Ney was ready
for a change of scenery. “Some
ofthe best experiences ofmy life
were up in that house on the hill,
though I don’t think I’d want to
live there now,” he said.

The space above Denny’s was
available for rent, so he moved in.

Even within the years since
Ney’s arrival at Pitt, he’s noticed
a dramatic change in the Oakland
bar scene. As the University has
become increasingly focused on
academics, there’s a decreased
interest in weekday partying.

“It used to be that the bars
were crowded every day of the
week, but that’s just not the case
anymore,” Ney said.

Despite the student popula-
tion’s recently bad rep for creat-
ing chaos, Ney insists that Pitt is
home to good people.‘ He ques-
tions how many of the destruc-
tive rioters during the Super Bowl
celebration and G-20 Summit
protests were actually Pitt stu-
dents. Ney himself even managed
to catch some wind of the G-20
commotion —— literally.

outside of Antoons, so I opened
the door to look out and see what
was going on. The police started

“Pick me up from work at 4 p.m.,
sharp.”

“Schedule my haircut — make
sure they know not to take too
much off the sides this time.”

“Do my laundry, and this time,
let’s try not to crease my Burberry
boxers, shall we?”

These are demands one would
expect from a Hollywood divo -
or “miva,” as I prefer —— to his
b*tch boy, excuse me, personal
assistant. As college students,
we would never dream of paying
tuition by the tens of thousands
just to land a job that requires sac-
riﬁcing practically all of our per-
sonality. Even if it means getting
to hang out with someone as cool
as Jake Gyllenhaal, the personal

assistant job is neither glamorous
or alluring.

This supposed universal college
mindset is what makes a recent in-
cident at Georgetown University
all the more puzzling: If we would

/only stoop to being a high-proﬁle

celebrity’s personal assistant in
the most dire "of circumstances,
why the hell would we take the job
 for a college sophomore?
Charley Cooper, a _19-year-old

student at Georgetown, posted’

a job listing on the University’s
Student Employment Ofﬁce web-
site “looking for someone to take
care some of my everyday tasks
for 1 hr a day, 5 hrs/ week, $12/
hr.” Some tasks include dropping
off and picking Cooper up from
work, doing and folding his laun-
dry (though the assistant would
only get paid for the labor, not the
time spent waiting for the rinse
cycle to end), running errands

and scheduling appointments for

haircuts.

Cooper would provide the car,
and as a “convenience,” he would
give preference to undergraduate
applicants. The personal assistant
could expect to make about $60
per week, or $300 per month and
Cooper will even give bonuses at
his “discretion.” .

Wow —— as if Georgetown didn’t
already have the reputation of
attracting many wealthy, elitist
students who have never done
anything for themselves in their
entire silver spoon-fed lives.

Even if we do give Cooper the
beneﬁt of the doubt -—— he is a full-
time student with a part-time job
at a ﬁnancial services ﬁrm, and
he’s dealing with an illness in the
family -—— it’s still impossible not
to scoff at this blatant display of
self-importance.

Band has no problem staying composed

Sierra Starks
For The Pitt News

The Composure

’ Oct. 24

6:30 p.m.
Diesel Club Lounge
412-431-8800

The Composure has neither a solid re-
cord deal nor a fancy practice space. What
it does have is a Pitt student, a kick—*ss,
universally themed single and a hope and
a prayer. ’

“Stop Now Start Again” is the first
single from the Composure. “[It] was one
of the ﬁrst songs that, once the band was
solidiﬁed, we did,” founder Paul Meno-
tiades said. “It’s been hanging in there
for a while.”

“A while” is almost three years in the
making. Menotiades and former band
member Jesse Hall co—founded the band
in 2006. Bassist Andy Marks and drummer
Cory Muro were added in 2007. After Hall
left in 2009, the band needed a new guitar-
ist/vocalist. It needed a Pitt student.-

The Composure didn’t have to scour

the Oakland campus looking for a Pitt
student that could sing, play guitar and
add to the band’s DNA. Matt Fuchs, the
newest: member of The Composure, and
Menotiades have known each other since
high school and have played and toured
together before. Fuchs is a junior at Pitt
studying accounting and economics.

Fuchs has big plans for The Composure.
Whether the band gets immediately picked
up by a label or does not is the least of his
worries.

“For years, bands have done it D.I.Y,”
he said, meaning the bands have self-
published albums. “[Other bands] have
pressed their own records and sold them
at shows. That’s definitely on the table
for us.”

Another idea on the agenda for The
Composure is change, particularly in the
way people listen to music and watch con-
certs. 3

“There was a time when everyone went
to shows, and every show was awesome,”
Muro said. “It would be awesome if it were
that way again.

“It used to be that ‘you could go out to
a show, and that would be a good night,”

Williams’ style an eclectic blend started as a way to pay bills

Performers love to sit back and listen
just as much as they love to perform. Well,
at least one does.

“I always consider myself a music lover
first,” Musician Keller Williams said. “I’m
always listening to different music.”

Williams uses tools such as Rhapsody,
Pandora and even the ordinary radio to
tap into newly released music.

“It’s something I’m into now, branching
out and trying to hear the types of music
I’ve never heard before,” Williams said.
“There’s tons I go back to and listen to, but
musically, there’s a wide variety.”

Variety seems to be a strength of Wil—'

liams personally.
His genre of music has been described

into one. This was not intentional.

“It just sort of evolved on its own,”
Williams said. “My first gig for money
was in 1986. That was just from learning
some chords and playing some songs on
the radio.”

a stool made more money

full of it,” he said.

That wasn’t his first experience with
pepper spray, though. Ney recounted a
Thursday night spent at the late Zelda’s
Green House Bar back during his Pitt
days. I

“It was really packed one night, and I
was sitting at the bar next to this really at-
tractive girl, and she asked me for a light.
Here I am, completely naive, and I pick up
what I think is a lighter and start pressing

4 it on. It’s not working, so I keep pressing it,

and all of a sudden, the girl passes out!”

Turns out, the lighter was a can of pep-
per spray. The bar had to be evacuated, and
the girl was rushed to the hospital. Need-
less to say, Ney didn’t get her number.

“I hope she’s not dead! She seemed like
a really nice girl,” Ney said, laughing.

Ney’s willingness to narrate his
strengths and weaknesses are part of what
sets the vibe of Gene’s Place. He strives
to create an “unpretentious atmosphere,
whereipeople can just be laid back. It’s
always attracted a really nice, diverse
crowd.”

While he originally never thought about
entering the hospitality industry, Ney en-
joys the business and would like to expand
and open another bar someday. A

“It’s rewarding to walk through the bar

and see full tables and great people,” he
said. “There needs to be more bar options
to keep people here in Oakland. It astounds
me how many people go to the South Side
and pay double what they would here just
because there are more places for them to
go in a night.”

Aside from the cheaper beer, another
draw to Oakland is the familial atmo-
sphere. A chat with Ney will produce more
than drink recommendations — he’ll often
impart his wisdom about life.

“Look at your education as going up
stairs. Think.of it as a progression,” he
said. “When an opportunity knocks on
your door, don’t be afraid to answer it. It
might not work out the way you’d like, but
at least give it a try.” ‘ ‘

“Always go to your graduation,” Ney
recommends to his students. “Walking
across that stage and getting that piece of
paper is a great feeling.

“I was lucky,” he laughed, “I had a very
large cheering section when I graduat-
ed.” '

No surprise there. Ney has a kind face
and encouraging personality to which
people respond. Ney admits he seems to

help people without even realizing it.

“There was a girl coming in here a few
years ago that was contemplating dropping
out of school. I have no.idea what I said to
her, but a few months later, she sent me
some candy and a card sayingl had helped
her decide to stay,” he said.

Ney’s upbringing is rooted in Pitt pride.
Four of his ﬁve family members have de-
grees from the University, and it’s clear
that he cares about the place.

“I love it here at Pitt so much [that] I
never left. Give back to your school, stay
involved,” he said. “A degree from Pitt is
something to be proud of — the lessons
I learned here will guide me through the
rest of my life.” '

necessary for someone in his position, but
the manner in which he is trying to attain a
personal assistant is absurd, not to mention
condescending.

Using Georgetown’s ofﬁcial student em-

light of blatant self—promotion. It’s like he is
this week’s college student equivalent of Bal-

media attention that points out major ﬂaws

Plus, if he can afford a personal assistant,
why doesn’t he just try one of the many
laundry services available to Georgetown
students, like SoapyJoe’s? At least then you
would be sparing some poor Georgetown
student’s pride. V

Cooper said he’s received a numberof
applications so far, both genuine and scath-
ing, so obviously there are at least some
students who feel that the serious blow to
their dignity is worth the money.

Film makes you wish it was
‘September’ every month

Documentary humcmizes famed Vogue editor

September Issue 4 19

Luckily for those genuinely interested in
gaining temporary access into the industry, the
fashion gods have teamed up with director RJ.
Cutlerto giveus “The September Issue.” Critically
acclaimed at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, the
ﬁlm scooped up a win for cinematography and a
nomination for the grand jury prize.

The ﬁlm is bracketed around the creation of
the behemoth ﬁve—pound September 2007 issue
ofVogue. As the months and weeks whittle away,
we watchasAnnaW1ntour——the editor ofVogue
for over two decades now — and her Voguettes
click-clack around the Conde Nast office in killer
stilettos.Just a glimpse atthese people, who argu-
ably must be some of the most glamorous folks
around (they are, after all, the tastemakers of the
world), is mesmerizing in itself. It’s oddly reassur-
ingto see them squinnto avoid Wintour’s wrath.
Vogue editors are insecure too? Who knew?

The beginning scenes establish Wmtour’s
powerinthe fashion business -—justin case, you
know, anyonewitharemote interestinstyle wasn’t
already aware of this. One interviewee is asked if
there’s anyaspectof the fashion industiy on which
Wmtour doesn’t have inﬂuence. He pauses for a
moment, searchingforasmall glitchinthesystem
that’s out of the reach of her manicured palm. In
the end, his answer is simple: “No.”

Evenviewerswithoutaninvestedinterest inthe
industry should have asubliminal understanding
ofW'mtour’s character. Her rumorededitrixnature
is, after all, the alleged basis for Meryl Streep’s

characterin“The Devil Wears Prada.” Those look-
ingforasimilarlyplot-driven gossip fest, however,
should look elsewhere. ' .

“The Septemberlssue” ismore documentary
than chick ﬂick. It reveals a glimpse at the hard-
edged business side of fashion that so often gets
pushed aside in favor of a portrayal emphasizing
parties and glamour. .

W1ntour’s daughter; Bee, describes fashionas
“aweird industry,” she’d rather“go to
law school” thanfollowinher mother’s footsteps.
It’s astounding to think someone would pass up
sucheasyaccessto that impenetrableworld, butas
theﬁlm shows, fashion isn’t for the faint ofheart.

And for those who are hankering to score a job
in the industry, it’s comforting to know ther€s
one less person with connections vying for the
same position.

While the ﬁlm certainly accentuates the toils

and stresses of th_e industry, Andre Leon Talley,‘

Vogue’s editor-at—large, serves as the ﬁlm’s much-
needed comic relief Upon W1ntour’s demand that
he loseweight, hetakes onplayingtennis, decking
hirnselfoutwithLouis Vuittonand rollingonto the
clay court. God bless a man with style.

“The September Issue’? p
is more documentary

Wintour gets her reputation. Behind her platinum
bob and oversized shades, though, Wmtour isn’t
cruel—hearted. She’s a hard worker with impec-
cable standards. It’s a shame, really, that being
so passionate and skilled at what you do means
a media—driven perception of soullessness and
fﬁgidity- l .

Panthers looking to blue out South Florida

When South Florida comes to Heinz Field tomorrow, Pitt hopes to dominate the Bulls surrounded by "a sea of blue-clad fans

Greg Trietley

Panther fans hope to make South
Florida feel a little blue when No.
20 Pitt (6-1, 3-0 Big East) takes on
the Bulls (5-1, 1-1 Big East) Satur-
day at noon at Heinz Field.

As part of Turn It Blue, a stu-

dent-created promotion meant to

- boost fan unity and participation,

Pitt students will receive blue T-
shirts before the game, and all
fans in attendance are encouraged
to wear navy to create a sea of blue

“In any big-time football pro-
gram not in the Big East, it’s not
a question of ‘What color are our
students going to wear to the
game?”’ Blue and Gold Society
president Max Greenwald said.
“For Texas, they wear that Texas

orange. For Oklahoma, they wear

that maroon. _
Hopefully this will be a startgto
get people to realize [blue] is our

color, and we should wear that all
the time.”

Pitt drumline member Grif-
ﬁn Butt is looking forward to the
Turn It Blue promotion.

“Our colors are blue and gold,
yet I see people at every home .

game wearing all sorts of colors,”
Butt said. “I hope this Turn It Blue
promotion inspires all Pitt fans to
stop wearing red, green and pink
to games. Pitt is blue and gold,
so let’s start wearing blue to the
games.”

Pitt running back Dion Lewis
looked good in Pitt blue and gold
last week, rushing for 180 yards
and two touchdowns against Rut-
gers. Lewis now sits second in the

nation in rushing behind Fresno

The Pitt men’s soccer team registered a season-
high 20 shots against Cleveland State, but the
Panthers still failed to come out ofWednesday’s
match with awin, tying the Vikings 2-2.

Pitt came close to earning its ﬁrst victory
since Sept. 1, as it led 2-1 late in the game.

But Cleveland State’s Josh Williams scored
the tying goal with seven minutes left in the
game. I ‘

“We had 20 shots, a lot of quality chances,
scored two good goals, and we hit the crossbar
with one that didn’t go in,” Pitt coach Joe Lux-
bacher said. “The disappointing thingis we gave
up a goal late.”

Youth supplied the offense against the Vi-
kings, as sophomores Ryan Brode and Sam Luify
scored for the Panthers, who now stand at 1—11—2
on the season and 0-7-2 in the Big East.

While the 20 shots is aseason high, the Pan-
thers have struggled to ﬁnish their chances all
year. i

“We’re always trying to work on ﬁnishing,”
Luxbacher said. “That’s the difference between
an average and a good team.”

Jasper Howard’s death brings down the conference’s morale

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

Every week, this column is where I usually ﬁnd
a lighthearted or appealing issue on which to
comment that deals with Big East football.

But this week is going to be different.

It’s different because of the senseless death
of University of Connecticut Huskies comer-
backjasper Howard. Howard died early Sun-
day morning, bleeding to death from a stab
wound to his abdomen after an altercation

C outside of the UConn student union.

Howard was 20 years old. His girlfriend
is expecting their ﬁrst son.

When talking about the incident, Con-
necticut coach Randy Edsall showed a truly
miraculous spirit in recounting the tragic
circumstances.

Edsall got the phone call at 1 a.m. last
Sunday from his director of football opera-
tions.

He left for Hartford Hospital but quickly
rushed to St. Francis, where they transferred
Howard. Edsall called Howard’s mom in Flor-
ida and waited with students and athletes
holding vigil at the hospital. He identiﬁed
Howard’s body at 4 a.m. and called for a team
meeting at 6. The rest of the team was dev-
astated.

Edsall is in one of the toughest positions
a coach willever face. Not only -must he focus
on game planning for West Virginia, but he
has to be a grief counselor for his team when
they look to him for guidance.

The problem is that there are no roadmaps
or game plans that deal with losing a team-
mate midway through a season.

He acknowledged that he is already going
above his title as head coach of ,Connecticut’s
football team.

“There’s nothing in my job description
that says you have to identify bodies,” Edsall
said in a teleconference.

One person who can sympathize with him

is South Florida coachjim Leavitt.

The Bulls never lost a player midseason,
but this summer, former player Will Bleak-
ley died at sea in a boating accident. Leavitt
knows the perspective you arrive at when any
player is lost.

“There’s nothing worse,” Leavitt said in
a teleconference. “You lose a football game,
it’s very difficult. But it is nothing like losing
a player.”

Edsall described Howard, who many team-
mates called “Jazz,” as a son.

“As Jazz looks down on us, I can promise
his son or daughter willfhave 105 uncles,”
Connecticut punter Desi Cullen told report-
ers shortly after Howard’s death. “We will be
better men because ofjazz.”

Young’ adults all over the country decide
to attend college to learn, ﬁnd a future and
be safe. But Connecticut showed us that col-
lege campuses can become crime scenes for
indescribable tragedies.

Howard grew up in Miami. Violence on
the streets of his hometown was a constant.
His mother worked several jobs to feed and
clothe him and his sisters, one of which was
afflicted with meningitis.

Howard was the ﬁrst in his family to attend
college when he decided to go to UConn. He
lived for football. The junior comerback even
had plans of pursuing an NFL career, like his
good friend Darius Butler who now plays with
the New England Patriots.

Instead, teammates were left to care for
him while he bled at 12:30 a.m. on Sunday,
mere hours after he led the Huskies to victory
against Louisville.

Joangela Howard sent her son to Connecti-
cut to escape the violence, not ﬁnd it.

The one thing we can learn from Howard
is his absolute love for his parents. According
to reports, Howard called his mother every
night before going to bed. Tragically, he didn’t
get the chance to one ﬁnal time.

West Virginia coach Bill Stewart, who will
honor Howard before the game on Saturday,

Fans looking to turn yellow Heinz Field blue

31

As part of Turn it Blue, students will get blue shirts at tomorrow ’s game and the Panthers ask all other fans to wear blue

Jay Huerbin
Sports Editor

When Coach Dave Wannstedt and the
Pitt football team enter Heinz Field on
Saturday, they want to see and hear the
blues.

That’s because a student-led campaign
to make sure everybody wore blue in the
stands is set for the Panthers’ Homecom-
ing matchup against South Florida.

The goal of the Turn it Blue promotion
is to have every fan in attendance wear
blue to show their support for the Panthers
and their 6-1 start to the season.

Coming off three consecutive Big East
victories, Pitt’s athletic director, Steve
Pedersen, said that students approached
him with the idea to turn the stadium blue.
They want to see not only the students
but all Pitt fans dressed in blue to cheer
on the Panthers.

The athletic department will give all
fans that attend the game with a student
ticket a blue shirt. Pedersen said the idea
is to combine a successful football season
with fans who have fun and cheer on their

team. 7
“This has been a tremendously exciting
football season thusfar, and we have the
opportunity to continue it with another
big game on Saturday against South Flori-
da,” Pedersen said. “We’re looking forward

to a great crowd decked out in blue and a’

great game this weekend.”

The idea was a hit, and student groups
have been involved since the start.

Although he said it wasn’t his idea, one
of the student leaders who is working to
make sure Turn it Blue is a success is senior
and Blue and Gold Society president Max
Greenwald.

He and other members spent Thursday
night hanging up ﬂyers in classrooms and
other parts of campus. ‘

“Hopefully we keep winning, and hope-
fully the students keep coming more of-
ten,” Greenwald said. “But in the long run,
hopefully there is a requirement for these
kind of things, because the students and
our fans will know what to do and what
to wear.”

Greenwald used the Texas Longhorns’
fans — who wear nothing but burnt or-
ange — as an example and hopes that with

has its own explosive freshman on offense
—— quarterback B.J. Daniels.

Daniels has seven passing touchdowns
this year and four more on the ground.

“He had a lot of schools recruiting him
as a receiver/defensive back,” Wannstedt
said of Daniels. “He didn’t have a ton of
schools recruiting him as a quarterback,
for whatever reason.”

Wannstedt’s praise for the Bulls extend-
ed beyond Daniels. . '

“They are explosive, not just at the quar-
terback position or receiver,” Wannstedt
said. “They are explosive at the defensive

- line. They are explosive at the running back
position. They’ve probably got as good of
talent man—for—man across the board as
anyone in our conference.”

The Bulls’ running back, Moise Planch-
er, has four rushing touchdowns from the
backﬁeld this season and averages 4.8 yards
per carry, though Daniels leads the Bulls
in rushing. '

On Pitt’s side, injured Panthers are near-
ing return. 1 ‘

As Pitt’s defense regains its health, South
Florida’s defense leads the Big East in points

“They put on a lot of pressure, so you
aren’t going to hold the ball long,” Wannst-
edt said. “You’ve got to b_e precise in your
routes, you’ve got to have protection and the
quarterback needs to make good throws.”

Should Pitt do those things, the team
has a. good shot at winning and moving up
in the national rankings, where the Pan-
thers made their season debut at No. 20
last week. _

“It’s great to be recognized when you
win some games,” Wannstedt said. “But
trust me, that will not be a discussion in
this locker room and with our players. Our
guys could care less.” ’

, Fellow Big East schools Cincinnati and
West Virginia rank at No. 5 and No. 22,
respectively, andwannstedt heralded the
level of competition ‘in the conference.

“I think it’s great for the Big East,” he
said. “People now are looking, and they
know the quality of football that we play.”

Season a success, so far  Miner; Grrrgrgjdte 

With two games left, the Panthers sit outside the tourney

Women’s soccer 4 27

Diana Connor I SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Rebecca Fraser and the Panthers have recently played solid defense, but not offense.

the tournament. The Mountaineers play Con-
necticut (10—6, 5-4 Big East) and Providence
this weekend.

Pitt sits at 74-5, but started the year
4-0, and has just two wins in its last eight
games. In those eight games the Panthers
have scored only three goals, getting shut
out six times, compared to just once in the
ﬁrst eight games.

Some of those shutout efforts have result-
ed in ties, but the lack of offensive production
is a concern heading into tournament play,
even with the defense playing so well. In the
last eight games, the Panthers have given
up ﬁve goals, three coming in a 3-0 loss to
Georgetown.

“Our defense has really solidiﬁed itself

with our game and how we want to play,
but now we need production up top,” Chin
said.

To come out on top, Chin suggested that
certain new tactical adjustments might be im-
plemented this weekend, but when it comes
to trying to get more offensive production,
there may be some personnel adjustments.

Heading into the Big East tournament,
Pitt can rely partially on what Chin has
called a very good season to overcome any
troubles.

Ultimately, though, the sentiment is that
of do or die.

“If we fall short of the tournament, this
season will be a disappointment,” Chin
said.

Plenty of new faces for Pitt

Basketball 4 28

“Everythingcame back rightaway——my shot, my
speed — but now I’m just a lot smarterz” _ _

Berenato alsothinks Sims is showingskills she
didrft posses at this point last year.

“Ithink [Sims] was in greatform last year, but
I think she’s in even better form now,” Berenato
said. “She’s become a student of the game.”

Berenato knows thatsirnsisthe one whohasto
lead the teamon the ﬂoor. Sims’ time offthe court
has developed her ability to become that leader.

“As the point guard, she’s the coach on the
ﬂoor,” Berenato said. “She’s the one who has to
Ithinkpeople are goingtobe
pleasantly surprised.”

Sims wants to be a leader for the team, and
she thinks that despite graduating two four—year
starters last year, Pitt can compete with the best
teams in the counuy.

“This team can be really good if we play to-
gether and work hard,” Sims said.

The Panthers tip oﬂ? the 2009 season Nov. 10
against Seton Hill at the Petersen Events Center.

While the women’s basketball team is getting
back a familiar face with Sims’s return, the men’s

teamis goingto lookalot different after arguably p

the best season in school history.
This year, the Panthers only return one starter
——]ermaine Dixon — from the team that last

season received its ﬁrst No. 1 national ranking V

and made the Elite Eight.

Levance Fields and Tyrell Biggs, two senior
starters for Pitt last year, are now playing profes~
sionally in Europe, while Sam Young and Dejuan
Blair were both second—round selections in]une’s
NBA Draft.

Dixon and Chase Adams, a transfer from
Centenary College in Louisiana, are the only two
seniors on the roster. ‘

They combine for one year ofBigEast playing
experience, as Dixon transferred to Pitt before
last season. '

Clearly, the team is facing many questions:
Who is the leader of this team? How can you re-
place four starters? Who will be the next great
players for this program?

The answertothe last question mightbefound
in what Pitt coachjamie Dixon calls “the best re-
cruiting class I’ve ever had.”

Players like Ashton Gibbs, Brad Wannamaker
and Gilbert Brown —— role players from a year
ago — will be expected to emerge as consistent
scorers for Pitt. But there are players that haven’t
playedinacollegiate game that might be readyto
make an immediate impact. V

One of those players is Dante Taylor, the ﬁrst
McDonald’s All-American Pitt has signed in more
than thirtyyears.

“I think Dante [Taylor] is going to be a very
goodplayer,” Dixon said. ‘‘He’s notaﬁfaid ofputﬁng
in the extrawork and the extratime.”

Taylor is one of three big men in Pitt’s 2009
recruiting class. Talib Zanna and]._]. Richardson
willalso contributethis season, and Dixonthinks
that all three are capable of making a_ signiﬁcant
impact.

“We knew we had three very good big men
whenwe recruited them,” Dixon said. “Some were
ranked higherthan others, butthey’re all goingto
be very good players for us.”

Dixon thinks that with the loss of Biggs and
Blair, there is a great opportunity for the freshmen
to prove that they belong on the ﬂoor. _

‘,“1‘ here are some freshmen that are going to
play a lot of minutes this year,” Dixon said. “One
of the reasons we were able to get such good big
menisbecause they knewthe opporurnitywould
be there.”

Even though Taylor committed to Pitt before
Blair armounced hewas leaving early for the NBA,
the forward knew there would be a chance to get
signiﬁcant playing time once Blair declared.

“Once I knew that [Blair] was leaving, I knew
there was an opportunity for me,” Taylor said.
“_I don’t know how much I’m going to play, ‘but I
want to play alot.” .

Dixon recalls saying that when he recruited
Fields, Biggs and Young, it was the best class

. he’d ever brought in. Those players lived up to -

the hype.

In 2009, Dixon said that Richardson, Taylor,
Zannaand small forward Lamar Paterson com-
prise the best recruiting class he’s ever had.

“This is probably the best foursome we’ve
had,” Dixon said. “They’re that good. They’re
great ki .” ' ‘

Cincinnati still Big East’s best

The Bearcats should beat Louisville handily thislweek

I ‘I BigEast< 30 M

said it best on his teleconference call.
“I can’t imagine what thatfootball family

 ’ and the Howard family is going through,”
Stewart said, i‘My God, how short and sweet .

life is and what we take for granted.”
Pitt Football Question of the Week:

In honor of Connecticut cornerback How- I I '

ard, who is the current Pitt defensive back that

is the cousin of Arizona Cardinals receiver .

Anquan Boldin?

Last week’s answer: Thanks to junior Kyle
Hill, who gave the correctanswer of LeSean
McCoy. Shady scored 90 points during his
freshman campaign.

Big East player of the week (Offen-
sive): * .

Dion Lewis, Pitt — The freshman player of
the year candidate ran for 180 yards and two
touchdowns in Pitt’s win over Rutgers.

Big East player of the week (Defen-
sive): -

Lawrence Wilson, Connecticut — Wilson
was a one—man wrecking crew against Louis-
ville with 16 tackles and a ﬁimble recovery.

Rankings of Power — Week 4:

1. Cincinnati (Last: week: 34-17 win at USF) _

- Clearly the team to beat in the Big East. Will
they make it to Pasadena?
2 . West Virginia (Last week: 24-7 win over

Marshall) — The Mountaineers must focus on ~

the game against Connecticut, despite the
obvious distractions. K 5 .

3. Pitt (Last week: 24-17 win at Rutgers)
- Big win against Rutgers last week, and is
there anyone out there who still wants to
boo Bill Stull? ' I '

4. South Florida (Last week: 34-17 loss
against Cincinnati) — The Bulls need a win
against Pitt to vault into contention for the
BCS bid. C

5. Connecticut (Last week: 38-25 win over
Louisville) — The big question: Will Howard’s
death unite this team or devastate them? I say
for this week, it hurts, but this team will play
in a bowl game this year.

6. Rutgers (Last week: 24-17 loss to Pitt)
— The Scarlet Knights really need to crank it

up in the stretch to secure a bowl bid. After
two Big East losses at home, they now have
only two remaining at home (West Virginia,
USF).

7. Syracuse (Last week: Bye) — An interest-

ing story to follow will be if the Orange can get .

to a bowl game this year. The task might be
manageable with Akron, Rutgers, Louisville
and Connecticut remaining. .
8. Louisville (Last week: 38-25 loss to Con-
necticut) —- Seven. That’s how many games

. the Cardinals dropped in a row to Big East I

opponents. Now you see why Steve Kragth—
orpe is on his way out. .

Week 8 Preview: _

South Florida (5-1, 1-1 Big East) at No.
20 Pittsburgh (6-1, 3-0): Pitt can’t under-
estimateateam thatwent into Tallahassee,

‘ Fla., and upset Florida State. But, the task

should be easier minus Bulls’ quarterback Matt
Grothe. An early indicator of the game will be
how South Florida decides to attack Pitt’s of-
fensive line. The Bulls have a stellar defensive
line, and if it creates pressure 'on_ its own, look

, for the Bulls to knock Stull around all game.

Connecticut (4-2, 1-1) at No. 22 West Virginia
(5-1, 1-0): It’s back to football for Connecticut

after a brief pregame ceremony for its fallen V

teammate. It could get interesting if Moun-
taineers quarterbackjarrett Brown can’t play,
butthey should handle the Huskies in this one.
Louisville (2-4, 0-2) at No. 5 Cincin-
nati (6-0, 2-0): To stay where they
are in the polls, the Bearcatsneed to
beat Louisville handily. And they will.

Rutgers (4-2, 0-2) at Army (3-4): The Scar’— I

1et.Knights head back on the road to play

yet another, yawn, out-of—conference game,

Army does have a win againstivanderbilt this
year, so Rutgers can’t sleepwalk atWest Point.
Akron (1-5) at Syracuse (2-4, 0-2): Akron
is terrible (0-sagainst FBS teams), but it was‘

last year as well when it beat Syracuse 42-28 ‘

in the Carrier Dome. Syracuse redeems itself
this year.

the start of the Turn it Blue promotion,
Pitt students won’t need the help of the

their team. ' 4
“Hopefully this starts a tradition that

program, you will wear blue,” he said.
But it’s not just football fans that are

 

It will provide for a better at-
mosphere for our team. And they

excited about the new promotion.
Basketball fans are also getting in-
volved. Josh Frantz, a senior and the

current president of the Oakland Zoo, V

encouraged fans to come out to game and
support the football team. '

 

Talk to me about Allstate Renters insurance. '
Typical renters own about $30,000 worth of stuff.
That's a for to lose. ll something bad happens, are
you covered? Don't hope 50. Know so,

“We feel it’s important to support all
teams,” Frantz said. “We want to get as
many students as possible to go to as
many sporting events as they can. The
basketball team is one of the best teams in
the country, but that doesn’t mean other
teams don’t deserve to have fans at their
games.”

' The Zoo sent out.e-mails to its mem-
bers, letting them know about Turn it Blue
and ho - es that fans will et involved with

   

  
   

their football team. -
Frantz, who attended last week’s foot-

ball game against Rutgers, referenced all

Rutgers fans wearing red last week and Pitt

basketball fans wearing gold as examples_

of what he wants to see on Saturday. He
believes that more unity among fans will
eventually lead to more success for the
football team. .
