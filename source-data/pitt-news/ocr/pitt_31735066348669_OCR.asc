PHEAA Requests $78 Million

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

Students can expect severely re-
ducedﬁnancial aid from the Penn-
sylvania Higher Education Assist-

@”"‘ance Agency (PHEAA) next year if
the State House Appropriations
Committee doesn’t approve the
agency’s budget request of $78
million, according to PHEAA Exe-
cutive Director Kenneth Reeher, in
a statement released this week.
Because of the current economic
slump, the ability of families to pay‘
for post secondary education has
decreased, Reeher said Tuesday

 

 

. - A hdraulically powered door

  

for handicapped stunts being builtiby

before the committee. Therefore,
he said, the demand for student aid
has increased.

“Sad to say,” Reeher said, “the
budget proposed by governor
Shapp, suggesting only $68.4 mil-
lion for a 12-month period, is sorely
lacking even for that length of
time.” 7

He added that even the $68.4
million would not suffice if the
agency was forced to operate on the
15-month.budget now proposed to
bring state government in line with
a federal ﬁscal program that would

,. , a private contractor ‘in the Bellefield exit of the Cathedral. It was
“&“designed by a physical plant employee, and its use will be limited to
_ handicapped students, since increased use will necessitate increased
~ maintenance.‘ Access will be. limited by giving each handicapped

student a special card-key.

Pitt commuters do not find it
acceptable to pay between $.40 and

, $.50 an hour for’ parking in a
 garage, according to a Pitt News
survey. The overwhelming majority

of commuters vehemently opposed
paying that much for parking in an
underground system, like the one
recently proposed by Pitt and the‘
city of Pittsburgh for Schenley
Plaza. -- ,
Schenley Plaza is the 223-space
metered city parking lot, used

. primarily by students," between "

Hillman Library and Carnegie Mu-
seum.

Ninety-eight of 100 commuters
polled said “No” to the question:
“Would you be willing to pay $.40

~ to $.50 an hour in a parking garage
 ~ if the standing proposal went
Wﬁrthrough?" Almost all the students
also were aware of ‘the other
F" . available parking places and voiced
F their satisfaction with_these facili-
 ties. “

“As much as we pay this Univer-

free parking,” commuter Frederick
Hill said. “At least. they could
provide a lot with nominal‘ fees.
Just enough 4 to break even--to
keep it functional.” -

‘‘I park and walk,”’Larry Irr said,
“for three reasons. One is to save a
little money. Two, there aren’t any
meter maids and any people who
will mess around with your car--like
banging into it. And three, walking
is good exercise.” ,

The two students who answered
“Yes” said it was worth the
convenience and it was too long ‘a
walk to Trees. They complained the
campus bus doesn’t run on a
regular schedule after the normal
hours.

The proposed $.50 hourly fee is
designed.as a ‘break-even’ rate,
considering the projected cost of‘
$8.5 million. The number of sites
would be 921. A number of
students wondered, why the Uni-

“To begin with, what the Gov-
ernor proposes is insufficient even
for a normal year,” Reeher said,
“but ifweﬂgo. to an expanded
15-month period, he allows nothing
for even an average number of
awards for an additional quarter
year, and particularly during a
period when we know we're going
to be hard hit by aid applications.”

Students Meet the Candidates”

BY A. IRENE SCHMIDT

Candidates in the May primary for
city and ‘county ofﬁces met
informally with interested students
during “Meet the Candidates
Day” yesterday in the Student
Union Venetian Room. _

College Republicans (CR) and
College Young Democrats (CYD)
co-sponsored the program, which
brought hopefuls for offices such as
County Commissioner, District.
Attorney (DA) and City Council
member to‘ campus.

“Students have been asking me
what Ithink is the basic issue of the
campaign,” Republican candidate
for DA Bernard Markovitz said. “I
think it’s professionalism’. We
need a full-time DA with a full-time
staff.” .

Pangborn Warns 8 3GB: ,2, A
No Allocations, No Filmsimii

BY PETE BUTCH

The Franklin Pangborn Film
Society threatened Student Gov-
ernment (SG) with discontinuation
of its film series if it is not allocated
sufficient ﬁlmmaking funds, during
Wednesday's SG meeting.

Along with showing ﬁlms on

Thursday, Friday and Saturday
nights, Pangborn also makes ﬁlms.
All the $3,782 approved by
Allocations was - for -filmmaking,
since the film seriesis self-suppor-
ting.

When Allocation’s recommenda-
tion was announced, SG President
Larry Platt objected, questioning
the use of so much money for a few
students to make films.

After Pangborn’s threat, -Platt
backed down and moved that
Pangborn receive" Allocation’s
recommendation. The motion
passed 4-0-1 with Chip Hubbard
abstaining. ‘ Platt,.Dan Stifﬂer,
Mark Satinoff and Craig Bluestein
favored the motion. - 1
,_“Thirty-eight hundred dwollcars for
a few "students to make films is a
luxury we can’t afford,” Platt said,
“especially when there’s no
indication that a large number of
students want to see those films.

“Very few groups receive this
much money,” Platt added, “and
those that do receive it only for
services rendered for students.”

Franklin Pangborn Co-President
Lucy Newman said, “We didn’t
want this to seem like a power play.
We just wanted to show how the
two parts ‘ of the
intertwined. _

“There are misconceptions about
the film society that need to be
cleared,” she said, citing the
recent letter published in-‘the Pitt
News accusing the society of letting
people in to its shows for free.

“I can understand-Platt’s think-
ing,” Newman continued, “but
this money beneﬁts many people
around the University, since you

‘ can’t separate the two halves of our

club." .

As for the claim that too much
money goes to too few people,
Newman estimated there are 25 to

current DA John Hickton of
neglecting prosecution of political
corruption because of party pres-
sures.

The Republican candidate, who is
a Pittsburgh attorney, also faulted
Hickton on the prosecution of the
Leonard Laufe abortion trial.

“He couldn’t prove a case in front
of a coroner’s jury,” Markovitz
said. “Who ever heard of that?
You don’t screw around with
people’s lives if you can’t prove a
case."

“We’re all in favor of apple pie,
the flag and a full-time DA,” said
former Police Superintendent

8 Robert Colville, now a Democratic

candidate for DA... ‘
Colville said ,he had no law
practice to cause a conflict of
interest and feels his qualifications

years,” Colville said.- He-listed
experience as patrolman, homicide
detective and attorney for the

‘‘It’s the function of the District

rather than the provision of social

differing reasons for entering the
race.

“My principal reason for running
is political minority representa-
tion," Marous said. “There are
50,000 non-Democrats in the city,
and they haven’t had political
representation in .36 years.”

“We must elect women, minori-
ties and young people to office,”
said Lee, who began building a
political base from those three
groups as Democratic Committee-
woman four years ago.

Tyrone “Chip” Hubbard and Phil
Davis, president of CYD and CR
respectively, expressed disappoint-
ment with the
attendance.

“I wish we could have had more
students come out,” Hubbard said.
“They just don’t care. But that’s
the mode of the American people
right now.” ’

Several of those student who did
question the candidates expressed
approval of the program and
interest in its reappearance.

"‘These are the kinds of things
colleges should have,” said Frank
Sacco, a sophomore in the School of
General Studies. “I wanted to talk
to Colville and now that I have, I’ve
made up my mind about voting.”

CR President Davis also found
conversation with the candidates
helpful, and said that for a ﬁrst
time, the program came off well.

Other candidates on hand were
Democratic, hopefuls for Judge of
Common Pleas Robert Dauer,
Livingstone Johnson, Emil Narick,
George Ross, Nathan Schwartz, 1.

For the first time in Pitt history,
the University Marching Band
plans to add a majorette corps to
the 1975 football season.

Tentative plans for the corps
include integrating it into the
Marching Band and coaching by a
professional choreographer, ac-

/cording to Band director Donald E.
Hower. Under Hower’s ‘supérvis- ‘

ion, the p majorette corps would
replace the present Pantherettes.

“There isn’t really a majorette
group (as of now), unless you want
to consider the Pantherettes such a
group,” Hower said. “I personally
don’t think you can have a student-
run group that will attain excel-
lence,-” he added.

Regarding opposition to adding a
maiorette corps, Hower said some
band members fear majorettes will
detract from their (the band mem-
bers’) performance; but he believes

“I want something that’s going to

hold the spectators’ attention dur-
ing half time,” he said.
- Pantherette co-captain Beck Paw-
loski said she is very optimistic
about the majorette corps replacing
the Pantherettes. “It is definitely
preferable to the Pantherettes. I
don’t think such'an organization
can be run effectively by someone
with high school experience,” she
said, and added the Pantherettes
will disband following the forma-
tion of the majorette corps.

Marching band member John
Charles opposes adding a major-
ette corps. “It doesn’t ﬁt the
marching band’s style,” said
Charles, “and the clamor‘ for
novelty which gave rise to the idea
will eventually die down.” "

Other members of the marching
band, however, expressed their
support of the proposed majorette
corps.

“I think majorettes are a good

idea because they could increase

our crowd appeal,”
member Amy Saul.

. “If we're going to have major-f 

ettes,” band member David Cav- 7

enaugh said, ‘.‘They should be an. - 

integral part of the band.”

Another goal Hower suggested  

was the purchase of new uniforms

for the band, but he added avail-_‘ .

able funds are currently inadequate
for the cost. He said he would like
to se the Golden Panthers raise
enough money for new uniforms by

the upcoming football season.’ ,

Career opportunities for college
graduates will be the topic — of‘.
discussion at the “College-Industry.
Dialogue” seminar, sponsored by

the National Association of Manu-

No Credits for ROTC

A  1 Next Monday the Facultyvof Arts and Sciences will vote on whether

ROTC courses should receive CAS credit. That may determine

 whether ROTC remains on campus at all.

The Department of Defense requires that a detachment be closed
when total enrollment ofthejunior class falls below 17. A spokesman

. for Pitt’s ROFC projected the comingfall term jimior enrollment will be
. exactly 17. (learly, then, if Monday’s vote goes against ROFC, the

programprobablywillloseenough studentstowarranttheendofthe

I -oﬂicers training school here.

The vote to strip ROTC of CAS credit came in 1968, and now some

I " » contend that move came on the crest of a high wave of anti-military

sentiment. Although seven years later that same activism seems to
have died, the military remains viable. _ . . - ,
At the heart of the liberal arts philosophy is the right to live one s own

. lifestyle, and this tenet has become one of the main arguments in the
, . ROTC’s struggle to gain credit. In what represents a shift from a past
 stand, we feel no matter how eloquently the military calls for respect as

a profession, its very existence denies this basic right to millions of’
foreigners the United States chooses to ﬁght and defeat.

The university seeks to cultivate appreciation for other cultines in the
hope that an understanding between strangers can be achieved. But

I I . the American military operates only in the national interest, therefore

damning those civilizations without discrimination when they stand in

- the way of -our own ‘progress.’ Such duty is not consistent with

humanitarian ideals. .
ROTC has shown evidence that college-educated ofﬁcers exhibit a

.. more humane attitude than do military personnel who receive their
‘ - training in ofﬁcers’ academies. Although military representatives of a

society are preferable to a specially trained, select corps, that is no
reason to keep ROTC on a university campus. Military instruction
could be given at some federal institution, perhaps the Federal

I A . Building downtown, but ﬁill-time ROTC students live and take their

CAS courses at Pitt. .
By maintaining the military on campus (and the University maintains

‘ I _ $18,000 worth), we are compromising our humanitarian beliefs and

providing an ever-present public relations department for ROTC. The
Army and Air Force obviously realize this, otherwise they would have
moved to off-campus training long ago. But as seen in their slumping
enrollments and ambitious ad campaigns, the proper selling of ROTC
is essential to the program's existence.

That is why the government pays its jimiors, seniors and scholarship

. recipients $100 a month plus full tuition, fees and books. Some feel

this gives underprivileged students an opportunity to attend college.

This is true, though the students are required to sign a contract binding
them to a commission upon graduation. Failure to live up to the terns
of the contract makes the student liable for four years of active duty.

hold.

ugtnother claim regards faculty appointments. The controversy centers
on the legitimacy of the military’s nomination within a university
atmosphere of all ROTC faculty. ROTC eagerly points out a Pitt faculty
board approves the nominees. But though Pitt approves them, the
FAS still does not appoint them, and there’s the rub. ROTC faculty are
notour own; they are visiting instructors that move every three years at
the discretion of the military, not of the University.

The enforcement of the no-credit stand of ROTC does not involve
rejecting the necessity of a ﬁghting force or even of one that is highly

‘ '  educated. Indeed, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd practicalreaons to counter this
I I stand. The real caseinvolves the conﬂict in.philosophies of -a liberal

‘arts university and the world’s biggest military machine. In the
context of the American military, the humanities augment ofﬁcer
training. But nothing requires Pitt to espouse the military arts in
return and serve as a base for their instruction. No matter how
compassionately ROTC candidates learn to kill, we would have no pride

. in the fact they learned it all here.

‘ Letters to the Editor

 

Group Opposes
Instructor Loss

Dear Editor,

He has done it again! We are
losing another good one. For the
second time this year the chairman
of the studio arts department has
succeeded in baffling art students;
this time with the decision not to
renew the contract of Pamela
Endacott, sculpture instructor.

During her two semesters at Pitt,
Endacott has shown herself to be a
good teacher and likely to get
better, and a good artist, [her work
featured in the University Times,
April 3 1975], but her contract was
not renewed.

Ifl assume, as I must, that V.D.
Cantini’s decision on Endacott is in
the interest of the students and the
department, I am truly perplexed.
When the chairman of a depart-
ment tells the students who inquire
about this decision that, “You are
just guests here, your tuition is just
a token...”, there is serious doubt
about his ability to ﬁllthe role of
administrator, which requires some
candor. Perhaps Cantini could best
serve the community and Univer-
sity by becoming a professional.
full-time artist and thus, vacate the"
head of the studio arts department
so it could be ﬁlled by someonw
whose nature doesn’t seem count-
er-productive to training artists and
to the goals of an educational
institution.

Sincerely,
Concerned Students

Pangborn Replies
To ‘Cheat’ Charge

To the Editor;

Wednesday's Pitt News contain-
ed a letter from Sue Knapp and
Bruce Parker questioning Franklin
Pangborn Film Society’s policies
stating that’ we allow large num-
bers of people, to view ﬁlms for
free. They claimedthat, “This
type of practice is disgraceful and
should be stopped before other
organizations follow suit!” .

This gives the Franklin Pangborn
Film Society a chance to explain
several things.

 Bahylift Hero Inspires Nation

BY PETE BUTCH
A .It goes without saying that when a

I. war occurs there are thousands of

 I innocents who get injured, maimed

p, or killed as bystanders.

' Once again, this situation comes
to lig t as the North Vietnamese
and iet Cong roll across South

* Vietnam. Children, already or-
phaned, are endangered by rock-
ets, mortars and riﬂe fire in their
homeland.

One can sit back and think: “Too
bad. ‘We have too many people
here to worry about."

Or: “Damn shame," and then
change the TV to another channel.

One can even accuse the Viet
V Cong of atrocities--which is ridicu-
lous, since Viet Cong rockets can't
tell soldiers from-children; all they
do is kill.
But no one does anything. Except
Edward J. Daly, president.of World
' --Airways. ' V

with the accounts of Operation
Babylift. Everybody is joining the
bandwagon--commercial’ airlines
are flying their own mercy
missions; President Ford has
pledged United States support of
the project.

But it took Edward J. Daly to
come forward and get things
started. ‘

For the past few weeks his planes
have been carrying rice into Phnom
Penh and Cambodia and refugees
out of Da Nang. On April 1 ‘he
announced his intent to airlift
South Vietnamese orphans to the
safety of the United States.

_ Worth an estimated $500 million,
Daly pays for each $70.000_flight
out of his pocket. He runs the
operation against the will of the
South Vietnamese government and
started it before the United States
would condone his actions. .
The South, -Vietnamese tried

   

stopping Operation ..Baby.lift.- the

is  » 

 

other day but allowed it to resume
after receiving pressure from the
US government and various refu-

'- gee organizations.

How successful it will be remains
to be seen. But you can be sure
Daly will be working harder than
ever when the siege of_ Saigon
starts, evacuating some of the
millions of innocents who will again
be in the way of rockets, mortars
and rifle ﬁre.

When the‘ Vietnam war ended in
early 197.3, Le Duc Tho and Henry
Kissinger shared the Nobel Peace
Prize for bringing about the peace
accord. Le Duc Tho turned down
his prize because he realized he
had created no solution. Kissinger
accepted his because he felt he had
achieved Peace With Honor.

No .one deserves a Nobel Peace
Prize as a result of the Vietnam
War more than Edward Daly. Let's
hope ‘that unselﬁsh acts of”

1. Our club membership totals at

Our club members get no pay, but
invest many Saturday and Thurs-
day nights presenting quality ﬁlms,_
like “Serpico,” “Last Tango in

2. We get services from Audio

3. Anyone entering the advanc-

for showing movies. We are an
independent ﬁlm showing society,
any ﬁlm we show must pay for
itself, and on Saturday nights it
must pay for security as well.
Please realize that it would not be
in our own interests to allow many
people into our moviesfor free.

Student Denies
Perjury Charge

Dear Editors and readers of the Pitt

News: I ‘
Somewhere in this issue of the Pitt

News, there is an article written by

me as a result of a sanction from '

the Campus Judicial Board. The

« article was to be written in lieu of

immediate suspension from the
University‘. The Judicial Board ori-
ginally sanctioned that I write a
letter to this publiction, admitting
guilt to the charges that were

'proven as face in that proceeding.

Those charges were willfullyand
knowingly falsifying information in
a University judicial proceeding.
Since they felt that the students of
the University had been lied to,

. they should be apologized to. And I

agree that this ‘is a serious offense,
and when proven,-it should be dealt

with seriously. The Vice-Chancellor.

of Student Affairs later reduced

that sanction with the directive that

a news article should be written
and not a letter. This reduction of
sanction made no mention admit-
ting that I was guilty but to merely
state that “My misrepresentations
could have resulted in the miscar-
riage ofjustice.”

What I am about to write is, of
course, only .my opinion, but I
believe it to be true. Even after
convition under these charges, I
still contend that I was not inten-
tionally withholding testimony that
I was charged with keeping from
the hearing record. I had forgotten
a portion of the situation that I was
testifying about. I later realized

that what I had said was inaccur-

ate, but it was too late. The charges
were ﬁled with Student Affairs by
members of the Judicial Board who
had felt that I was not telling the
whole story. ‘

l shallrefrain from going through
all the details of my hearing, and
merely state that I felt it was
handled in a most distasteful
manner by all of those involved in:
the prosecution. Again, in ,my
opinion-and the opinion of others I
was faced with proving that I was
innocent. instead of the prosecu-
tors having to ‘buildisolid evidence

_ . . fguixi _ I _ .

  

. ofﬁces, or accept immediate susegg

. pressed the original charges

='%FF.‘? ‘ef§$'.~ I

testimony and counter-testimony" /
were given, and I was found guilty

of an extremely demeaning charge 1‘
with proof of only one’s wordt '
against another’s. The prosecutors

in the case asked that I be put, 
probation as the most serious“"' 1';
sanction. But the Campus Judicial 
Board thought that it was more ’
serious than even those who it ‘had 2‘
originally offended, so they decid- 
ed that the ultimate punishment 
should be suspension. Here’s the
relief though, I could write a letter
to the Pitt News and admit my
guilt, along with receiving a perm-
anent reprimand. But no matter
what they proved to themselves as
guilt was still not my opinion, I
believed I was innocent and would
not say that I intentionally lied to a
Judicial Board. I still believe that, .
but I had no choice.  ' .,

After the sanction was reduced, I
set to writing an article that would
explain the dangers of misrepre-
sentation. I wrote ﬁve such articles
and none of them were acceptable M
for a variety of reasons. I had the ‘

option to try to appeal the case but
frankly, I was sick of endangering
my education in this mini-court 
system. There was no time limit in
my instructions to write the article
but nevertheless, I kept on writing
so that this matter could be gt
disposed of. I would not admit to - 
something that I didn’t.believe in,.

so none of the articles were in _
fulﬁllment of how the director -0  
the Student Judicial System per- \
ceived my_sanction. _ ‘

 
 

Since this is the last issue of The , .3?
Pitt News for the winter term, I was ‘ 5"?
given the ultimatum that I either A
send some approved article to. your 

5"” 5;

pension ‘for this term. As 'the*'',‘-' '1
Coordinator said “or don’t bother
taking youriﬁnals,” now that’s an
ultimatum..Since none of my drafts
were acceptable, I was given two
others, one by the Board who had

against me, one by the Coordin-
ator. I was instructed that two
.members of the Board were willing
to work with me on the ﬁnal draft. , - ‘it.
Both of them were just as goodﬂw ’
anything to fulﬁll the demands of - -. ‘ .
the sanction, but in both I had to .5’
admit my guilt. I wanted_to reject
these writings, but no matter how
inuch I had rejected, the admission
was mandatory for approval. So I it
reluctantly signed one of the drafts. 

!

 

I have been advised by my legal
aides to let everything stand as it

was, but I didn’t feel right. Perhaps 
it will be felt that this letter will’ j
negate the effects of that article, , 
but I do belive that this judicial

system could be a perfect avenue J
for justice. The only part that I do

not agree with is that I perjured’ 
I

myself.

Maybe it’s not going to beover - 3
now, but I hope so. I apologize to 
the students for not telling an _ ;
accurate story to their judicial 
system, I respect justice and I
respect the students, or else my V
efforts to help them in the past two ‘ ,
years were in vain. I hope the I
students will always, have the
privilege of being dealt with fairly.
It has been my policy in the past to . ‘fr
oppose any abuse of the Pitt News. ji
For me to write a letter is rare, but I fl
take refuge in a place where I sew
the most freedom. Participate in I
the ‘ wheels of justice but don’t
make any mistakes. With this I
hope for justice and still place trust , ,_.
in the students.

Due Process

Student Integrity

BY PAUL B. HERTNEKY

In the past several years, most
students have become aware that
the University of Pittsburgh utilizes
an administrative hearing process

— to resolve questions of student
behavior. In doing . this, the
University has recognized students

V. ~"-“' uld and can monitor student
oetiav or. The judicial system has
afforded the unique opportunity for
students to participate in all facets
of decision-making processes that
determine the propriety of student
behavior‘.

The University system has as its
components in non-academic
areas, first-level hearing bodies
known as the Residence_ Hall and
Campus Judicial Boards. Above

these is the University-wide appeal
body known as the University
Review Board. At both levels
student participation is on an equal
‘level with that of faculty and

administration. Students are en-
couraged to participate in repre-
sentative capacities. A committee
of the undergraduate Student'Gov-
ernment, Legal Awareness, plays
an active role by advising and
representing students who are
called before the hearing bodies.
The integrity of the procedures is
contingent on the sincerity and
honesty of all participants. Inten-
tional misrepresentations have the

he Maharishi and TM

BY RALPH HAURWITZ

NEW YORK--While thousands of
alcoholics in thousands of bars
were numbing their minds to the
world, and many more housewives
and businessmen were worrying if
their budgets would survive the
depressed economy, an Indian
monk with a degree in physics
named Maharishi Mahesh Yogi,
speaking to 9,000 people at Madi-
son Square Garden March 24, had
some surprising news: The age of
enlightenment has dawned.

“We see the world becoming
better,” Maharishi said.
“Through the window of science
we see a time coming when we will
have an ideal society. We want to
hasten the pace of the dawn of that
age so the sunshine will come
sooner.”

The key to this age, as Maharishi
explained it, is transcendental
meditation, or TM, a non-religious
technique for gaining deep physical
and mental rest, practiced twice
each day for 15 or 20 minutes.

Maharishi is the founder and
leader of the TM movement. HIS
message: Increasing the number

of meditators will naturally im-
prove the quality of life in the
‘‘If one per cent of the

world.

  
 

world meditates," he said, “a
transition from disorder to har-
mony will be seen.”

His scientific evidence for this--
and for the coming of “the age of
enlightenment”--is “studies which
show that in cities where one
per cent of the population has
begun transcendental meditation,
crime has ‘gone down.”

   

These unpublished preliminary
studies, according to TM literature,
show 17 per cent average decreases
in the crime rates of 240 cities in
which one per cent of the
population had been meditating.

“When many more people are
meditating," Maharishi said, “the
achievements that await us are
inconceivable. All sickness,

that arises from stress and strain

will change from suffering to
happiness, from struggle to fulfill-
merit."

To help usher in this new age,

ience--the majority of it medita-
tors--in a five-minute meditation.

Four thousand five hundred people
--there was an equal number at a
later lecture--sat with their eyes
closed, practicing the technique
that focuses‘ attention inward
rather than out, allowing the mind
and body to experience a deep rest.

The silence in the Garden’s huge
Felt Forum was broken only by the
clicking of photographers’ shut-
ters.

The crowd that had come to hear
Maharishi in New York--and
similar crowds-in Boston, Atlanta,

Maharishi spoke to them without
notes from a French love seat,
where he sat cross-legged, wearing
a white robe and surrounded by
flowers. He called on the medita-
tors to get their friends and ‘non-
friends” to learn TM. 2

“Meditation has become a social
obligation," he said. “One must
meditate because he has no right to
move around with a disorderly
mind.

“TM brings the mind to the state
of least activity and excitation,” he
explained. “The influence of this

estimates the number of regular
donors--those who give twice a
week--at 100-150. The numbers are
reﬂected in the voluminous ﬁles
maintained by Sera—Tec.

each donor by checking blood
pressure, weight, temperature,
pulse and sugar levels.

Once cleared by the doctor, the
donor returns to the screening
table, for a finger jab. The sample
is then transferred to a mini-centri-
fuge. After centrifuging, the pro-
spective donor receives two plastic
donor bags and then moves to a
phlebotomist--or veni-puncture ex-
pert--for the real thing.

“It’s all right to keep using one
arm all the time,” Tygielski said.
“Of course,'the scar tissue will
build up that much faster. As far as
health or safety is concerned, it all
depends on the size of the veins
and strength of the skin. Some
people have small, weak veins that
collapse after one time and others
have real_ rivers that never stop
ﬂowing. It’s just trial and error,
mostly."

At this point, the new donors near
their peak of apprehension. The
phlebotomist, or veni-puncture ex-
comes to the chair and
inspects the runner’s work. Then
she swabs the donor.’s inside elbow
with fan iodine solution for. a
minute." ~

The swabbing, for disinfection, is

repeated with a stronger solution. _
The crook of the elbow turns a

sickly shade of yellow. Satisﬁed,
the phlebotomist mops the area
with a gauze pad, ready for the
‘stick.’ ._ ‘

The ‘stick’ usually causes a grim-

ace in males and a momentary
paleness in females. “Girls have a
highertolerance for pain," a nurse
explained in superior tones. “Some
of the guys are really babies about
needles." _

One such unlikely baby is a
regular donor. Big and blonde,
John comes twice a week--always
expressing outrage at the ‘agony’
he undergoes. The swabbing
makes him flinch. First sight of the
needle sends him into panic;strick-
en reconsiderations. “Oh no, wait a
minute now, I think I changed my
mind. Just hold it.” His long legs
squirming, John screws up his eyes
and holds his breath dramatically
while the phlebotomist makes the
stick. 

‘‘He’s been here a hundred times,
but he always does this,” the
runner said, grinning. The other
regulars appreciate the show. The
newcomers stare in horror. John
just pumps slowly, staring at the
ceiling while the bag ﬁlls.

Donors are supposed to fill both
bags. The donation process is
called plasmapheresis, which re-
fers to theretention of the plasma

One ‘unit of whole blood--500-600
milliliters,_ depending on the 4 do-
nor’s -weight--is withdrawn. The
unit is centrifuged within the bag to
separate the liquid portion of the
blood from the red cells. ‘

The cells are returned to the donor

they were removed. Mixed with ‘a
sterile saline solution to help
replace the lost ﬂuid, the cells
sometimes cause a reaction when
they return. A few people are
sensitive to the potent anti-coagu-
lant in the solution. At any given
time, someone on the main ﬂoor
will have his feet elevated, an ice
pack on his head and a blanket Over
his body.

That reaction is one of many
possibles. Sera-Tec,literature, as
required by the FDA,» details the
risks of plasmpheresis. Fainting
spells, weakness, bruises and in-
fection are all possible conse-
quences. .The major risk--reinfu-
sion of someone else’s blood--is
guarded against stringently. Elab-
orate precautions are taken to
ensure that the numbers and
signatures on the donations ‘bags
match‘. L

The identification system has yet
to break down. “One kid, a real
winner, said the signature on the
bag was his. The phlebs were tired,
it was a long day, and the girl
almost stuck the cells back into this
kid. Luckily, she checked the
numbers and found they didn’t
match. That was the closest call
we've had.”Tygielski relates the
incident with ' displeasure.

"But you know, most of the
people who come here have been
cooperative. I’d say 99% of them
are acceptable. Only a few are
rowdy or questionable--the wmos

bucks on the side. But we really

don't have the kind of trouble that

the whole blood agencies have.

‘ It's become an accepted thing to 0
give plasma,” Tygielski continues.

“Money isn’t always the incentive.
We give $5.and $10 for regular
donations, sure, but some people

actually refuse the money. A lot of »

donors just like the center--they
come to catch.up on their reading,
talk to friends, relax, whatever.”
Tygielski is frank in his assess-
ment of the center’s successful
operation. “Oakland is the ideal
site because of the great number of
potential donors. With all the

colleges around, plus. the people in ~

the community itself, we have an
untapped market.”

Despite_ Tygielski’s protestations
about the money incentive, the
donors themselves admit it is often
a deciding factor. “I saved enough
money during the fall term to buy

everybody in my family really nice 

Christmas presents,” one Pitt stu-
dent said. Another uses the $l5 for

weekly grocery money. Even the. '1

members of the Sera-Tec staff
occasionally sell ‘their plasma _dur

, Maharishi urged meditators not to
conceal the fact they practice TM.
“Let meditation be a respectable

. word,” he said. “One should not

— hide.oneself, one should feel proud

to say that one meditates.”

To counter those with complaints

_ against the TM movement, Mahar-

the organizations and people
behind it. “Don’t mind the
I weaknesses of teachers and the
A movement--nobody’s perfect,” he
,_ said. “What's important is the
knowledge of meditation."
’ This knowledge is said to be
rooted in the ancient Vedic
tradition of India, where Maharishi
spend 13 years sojourning in the
Himalayas before deciding to
present TM to the world in what he
calls a scientific fashion. This
.. long-haired, bearded, good-
natured little man, probably in his
ﬁfties--his exact age is not revealed
— because he considers it unimpor-
tant--uses phrases like neuro--
physiological refinement, mini-
mum entropy and unbounded
awareness to describe the exper-
ience of transcendental meditation.

*>l<*********

’ Although claims that TM will help
V bring about world peace and an

“age of enlightenment” seem
over-exaggerated, thousands of
satisﬁed meditators around the
world are saying it improves their
lives in many ways, besides
providing a deep rest.

The list of beneﬁts they claim
I borders on the fantastic: reduced

anxiety and nervousness, inner
peace and security, more energy,
increased productivity, better
grades, improved athletic perfor-
mance, improved social relations,
increased self-understanding,
greater happiness and relief from
headaches, back pains, asthma,
high blood pressure, ulcers and a
thousand other physical ailments.
Some researchers believe TM can
help alleviate alcoholism and drug
addiction and aid in the rehabilita-
tion of prisoners.

Maharishi estimates the number
of transcendental meditators in the
world at over 900,000, with some
400,000 in the United States
alone--“the most creative country

in the world," he says. Americans I

are learning to meditate at the rate‘
of 15,000 a month. In Pittsburgh
there are 3,000 meditators, with 80
new initiates monthly. ‘

The one statistic unavailable from
TM advocates is the number of
people who learn to meditate and
then quit.

First popularized in this country
by the Beatles, TM is now
receiving attention from the busi-
ness, scientiﬁc, educational ‘and
political communities. The com-
mandant of the US Army War
College is a meditator; the New
York Jets once had 16 members,
including Joe Namath, meditating;
the director of the Pennsylvania
Education Association practices
TM; and the assistant to the
chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee of US Steel meditates.

There are 350 centers for teaching
TM in this country, and hundreds
of colleges offer courses in the
“science of creative intelligence,”
also founded by Maharishi, which

is supposed to explain the physical
and mental aspects of TM.

Why is TM becoming so popular?
Can it really improve one’s life?
And just what is TM all about?

*********=l=*

Transcendental meditation is a
technique of turning the mind
inward to finer levels of thought, so
that deep rest, which relieves
stress and fatigue, can be
achieved. TM can be thought of as
“tuning down the system.”

The idea is that by getting rid of
stress and experiencing ﬁner levels
of thought, a person will enjoy life
more, develop a stronger mind and
realize more of his potential.

The practice of meditation in-
volves sitting in a comfortable
position with the eyes closed for 15
or 20 minutes in the morning and
evening. A quiet environment is
recommended but not necessary;
many people meditate on buses,
subways and airplanes. The
meditator gently thinks about his
mantra, a meaningless Sanskrit
word that is described as the
vehicle for experiencing these
deeper levels of thought.

Unlike other forms of meditation,
TM does not involve concentration,
contemplation or effort. It is an
experience, not a‘ process of
intellectual analysis. Though many
people mistake it for one, TM is not
a religion or philosophy. And,
according to ’John Hulme, 26,
chairman of the Pittsburgh TM
center, both believers and skeptics
can learn TM and achieve the same
benefits.

“anyone who can think a thought
can learn to meditate,” said
Hulme. “In our society there’s an

only I9 DAYS l.EI'-‘l'

attitude that anything worth doing
is worth doing well, and that to do
well you have to try hard. But TM
is effortless. By not trying and just
experiencing, a natural response is
achieved. TM teachers can show
this effortless path.

“After they learn how to
meditate,” added Hulme, “many
people say, ‘Why didn’t you tell me
it was so easy?”’

But that costs money: $125 for
adults and $65 for college students.
Many people balk at the price, but
TM teachers and satisfied medita-
tors insist it is fair. The
International Meditation Society
(IMS) is registered with the
Internal Revenue Service as a
non-profit organization. The
course fees, besides paying for the
instruction, go toward administra-
tive expenses and the furthering of
the movement, which has moved
into the realm of big business.

The TM organization has pur-
chased, at a cost of $2.5 million, the
campus of former Parsons College,
in Fairfield, Iowa, as the site of
Maharishi International University.
Other branches of the movement
that teach meditation are: the
Students’ International Meditation
Society (SIMS), which concentrates
on high school and college
students; the American Foundation
for the Science of Creative
Intelligence (AFSCI), which caters
to the business and professional
communities; and the Spiritual
Regeneration Movement (SRM),
which emphasizes growth in the
wholeness of life.

All these organizations teach the
same technique, and every one of
the 8,000 TM teachers in the world
has been trained personally by
Maharishi.

Brochure

The actual process of learning to
meditate begins with two free
lectures, which explain TM and its
benefits, with the aid of scientific
charts from sources including
Scientific American and the Amer-
ican Journal of Physiology, which

depict the rest experienced during’

TM.

A ten-minute personal interview
with a teacher precedes the course,
which lasts four days--90 minutes
each day.

A course requirement is absten-
tion from non-prescription drugs
for two weeks before hand. And at
the time of personal instruction the
prospective meditator must bring
fresh-cut flowers, fruit and a white
handkerchief, which are used in a
ceremony of gratitude before the
student receives his mantra and
learns to meditate.

- The gratitude, which the teacher

expresses in Sanskrit is to Guru
Dev, Maharishi’s teacher, and to

all those before him who kept the gig‘

knowledge of TM alive through the
ages. Guru Dev’s picture stands on
a dresser-turned-altar before which
the ceremony takes place.

The number of mantras and the
way they are chosen are tightly-
kept secrets, “to maintain the
effectiveness of the teaching,”
Hulme said. The TM initiate must
promise never to speak his mantra
out loud. ’

A question and answer forum in
the Journal of the American
Medical Association, on February
18, 1974, dealt with the charge that
TM is a “cult”, and made_ the
following points:

--whether TM is a cult depends on
one’s own definition of cult.

'--there is a difference between
religious convictions and ritual that
contributes to self-control.

--cut flowers and a white
hankerchief would seem a small
price to pay for sound sleep and
lowered blood pressure.

Browne had the audience in his

described as nothing less than a
devastatingly spectacular. He has

a style in playing and singing

Mirabai’s strong voice but weak

any previous expectations we had

Tender Trap Dims the

Lights and Softens Music

BY B. LAMBL

One thing I can say for Pittsburgh,
1 ’s spawned a bar culture worthy
of a metropolitan citizenry. Black
bars, steel bars, college bars- and
Appalachian bars all coexist
between the three rivers.

One place that I never got around
to writing up, but that I’d like to
turn you on to is Zorba’s Tavern,
1306 East Carson Street ..on the
South Side, which, serves up Greek
wine, Greek liqueurs and mandolin
music, if not truly reﬁned Greek
music.

” Then, out in the Strip District, the

 

Nite Kap East pours rhythm and
funk into Penn Avenue in the

~middle of the night. Dancing is de

rigueur. The band does it up
behind the bar, the people do it
between the tables.

And for people who want to forget
they’re in Pittsburgh, there’s the
Tender Trap in East Liberty.

When you walk in off Highland
Avenue, you feel as if you’d driven
all the way.out to Somerset. A
thicket of pines seen from a pit
belowthe bar sets the tone for the
night. Inside it’s'dim, and the light
playing on the trees seerns to bring
them into the bar. Their presence
is mellowing. Through the
branches, the glint of Grucci’s pink
sign is all the more tantalizing a

A Group Split Yields Musical Gem

BY TOM WASELESKI

. Strangely enough, the best Moody
Blues album ever recorded is not a
Moody Blues album at all, but a
record by Justin Hayward and John
Lodge, two principal members of
the now defunct group.

 

Entitled’Bluejays, the album takes '

up where the group left off on its
last effort, Seventh Sojoum. The
Moody Blues appeared to have
been moving into a more_ fully
orchestrated period toward the
end, even producing less synthetic
sounding music from their syn-
thesizers. Rumor had it that the
group's next album was to beat"
Beethovanian signiﬁcance. If the
cuts on the Hayward-Lodge record
were scheduled to be on that
album, I believeithe claim. .

despair of many. This band has the

highest energy and good-time
feeling of any band around. The
talent so far exhibited is only
beginning to see the credit due.

Best composer [singer/ song-
writer]: Jackson Browne, espec-
ially for his latest release. He

lead guitarist and Lodge was the
bass player, this is by no means a
guitarist’s album. The lush
orchestration is conducted by none
other than Peter Knight, who
handled the London Festival

Symphony on Days of ‘Future

Passed. Knight’s inﬂuence on one
of the new cuts, “Nights, Winters,
Years,” is very reminiscent of the
ﬁnale to “Nights in White Satin.”
Every song on the album is a
virtual gem, exhibiting a great deal
of complexity that relies an honest
rhythm and good melody. .The
intricate, the
tunes weave carefully in and out
each other, and...oftentimes an
underlying melody suddenly rises
to dominate the entire piece.
“Saved By The Music” is
especially good and resembles to a
great extent -one of the Moody
Blues’ better recordings, “Isn’t
Life Strange.” Both songs were
written by John Lodge and sound

like an integration of two wholly _

different ideas; where other artists
are competent to do mere paste-up

jobs’ of separate concepts, Lodge:
_ spins and mixes until he achieves

the effect he wants. _
“When You Wake Up,” a
collaboration by Hayward and
Lodge, is the unique concoction of a
lazy ballad and a driving refrain.
The song begins easily in a waltzy
guitar strum, then is overlaid by

Whenever a subject catches the
public fancy, a spate of books is
sure to follow. You know, UFOs,
the Bermuda Triangle, Howard
Huges, etc.

, About a decade or so ago, people
began to realize films were indeed
an art. The trickle of first-rate
works by authors like James Agee
became a_ ﬂood of excellent and
not-so-excellent books.

reminder of the city. A
well-traveled friend tells me there
are bars like this in Miami.

Down in the corner sits Tom
Haberman with his guitar on his
knee. He plays and talks to the pit.
He asks the people what they want
to hear. And from their easy chairs
they tell him to do a rain song. It’s
a professional crowd, and it likes
soft music. Haberman’s at
ease--as if he were entertaining in
his own living room.

His technique is so skillful that he
makes people around him stop
talking and listen. His best work
came out on a Spanish piece by
Segovia, in which he moved from

brought at least one welcome
development--the publication‘ of
screenplays in book form. Though
hardly any had‘ been published
before, the late ’60s witnessed the
arrival of several series of paper-
back screenplays.

What good is a published screen-
play? Of course, reading one is not
the same as seeing the movie. But
if properly supplemented by pho-
tographs, a screenplay can allow a
reader to relive a favorite film or
visualize can allow a reader to
relive a favorite film or visualize
one that’s rarely shown. A book
has another advantage--individuals
scenes can be examined repeated-

full-bellied strums to double-han-
ded runs. But usually he plays
down his technical skills in favor of
establishing a rapport with his
audience. And then his guitarwork
becomes a backdrop for the vocals.

Even when he sings, his voice is
casual, almost conversational. He
spotlights the lyrics, even in ﬂuffy
songs, and makes them reason-
able. Saturday night, Haberman
had a ﬂutist accompanying him.
For most of the evening, however,
the two instruments were pitted
against each other. Only toward
the end were the spatial capacities
of the songs recognized as large
enough for two sets of insights.

The layout of the club, unfortu-
nately, did not allow Haberman’s
inﬂuence to extend throughout.
The middle section by the bar
heard him only as background

music and thus could not appre-"

ciate his interpretive voicing. The
back section was completely set off
by beaded curtains and had more
the atmosphere of a cocktail party.

The Tender Trap accommodates
people who want to get away from
home and talk. It is very conducive
to tete-a-tetes as well as to group
get-togethers. The seating ar-
rangement is the most civilized I’ve
seen anywhere. Low, round tables
are scattered acrossythe room with
easy chairs paired off or clustered
around. 1

(Continued from Page 10)

A good example of a screenplay’s
usefulness is Scenes From A
-Marriage (Pantheon/Bantam). The
film has been cut in length for its
‘American release, but it remains
intact in the book.
Perhaps the best series from the
'60s was published by Grove Press.
The four profusely illustrated books
included much valuable‘ supple-
mental material, including stories
the films were based on. A much
larger series published by Simon
and Schuster had fewer pictures
and skimpy commentary, but a
much wider selection of contem-
porary .and classic films. These
books weren't as meticulous as the
Grove ones, which even listed the
duration of shots and presented
photos in clumps instead of with
the text.
A valuable new series has been
started by Avon Books. While the
other series stagnate, Avon’s pub-
.lished four books already and at
least two more will come soon.
The Avon books have pictures.
Over 1,400 in each book. The books
are 8‘/2” by 11”, so the pictures
are big. Frame enlargements, are
used instead of publicity shots.
The dialogue is beside the frame it
belongs with. Certainly among the
most detailed and thorough film
books available, the Avon books
will be useful to ﬁlm buffs and
However, The

Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade.
Yeah, anyone who’s seen Falcon
will surely remember him. And
also Mary Astor,_ Peter Lorre,
Sydney Greenstreet and the rest.

I:f‘§g,.,,Falcon does a commendable job of

 

refreshing memories of this out-
standingfilm. And as editor Ano-

bile points out, the examination of

camera angles, set decoration and
lighting, which the photos provide,
is helpful.

PSYCHO:

HITCHCOCK’S
The Film Classics
Library, edited by Richard J.
Anobile, Darien House/Avon
Books, 1974, 256 pages, paper,
$4.95. '

Film freaks might want to look at
this series of picture books.
Psycho (and Frankenstein, Mal-
tese Falcon and Casablanca, as
well as presumably soon-to-some

Ninotchka and Stagecoach) has

been done in‘ book form, more or
less like a giant comic book.

According to the book jacket,
there are “over 1,300 frame
blow-ups, every scene and every

‘ word of dialogue?" in Psycho. We

didn’t count the words or the
pictures, but from what we
remember of the film, we’ll take

__their word for it.
If you missed Psycho, itinvolves a

girl who steals $40,000 and skips
town. On her way out, she stops
overnight in a remote country
motel, having lost her way in a
driving rainstorm. The innkeeper
is a nice young man who takes care
of his mama. "They live in the big
house on the hill behind the motel.

There are no other guests in the
motel; there never have been since
the freeway went through and took
awav the motel’s clientele. The

CHILDREN’S THEATRE
Circus Machine, the play current-

ly being toured by Pitt’s children’s
theatre company, Childsplay, will
be presented in two public perfor-
mances April 12 and 13 at 2 pm in
the Studio Theatre (basement, CL).

Admission for both performances
is $1. For reservations, contact the
Theatre Arts Division at 624-6567.

‘girl/thief decides to have a nice hot
shower,‘ but the nice innkeeper
thoughtfully stabs her. He
disposes of the body and the
$40,000 in a nearby swamp.

The plot thickens when a private
investigator, hunting for the girl
and the money, wanders into the
motel. He too winds up in the
swamp. Finally the dead girl’s
sister and her friend track her to
the motel and /uncover the whole
terrifying story behind the mur-
ders. We won't tell you the reason,
except to‘ mention that it’s
something like Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde. "

That was the movie version. The
book version is similar. All the
important parts seem to be there.

light reading, or if you’re inter-

worth your while to look at these
classics. ~

The book itself is nothing
spectacular. The pictures were
taken from the original released
version, Anobile claims. He notes
in his introduction that the released
version was out about ten minutes
from the original ﬁlmed version,
mostly because of censorship
problems in the shower scene and a
couple scenes elsewhere. The
photos are of reasonable quality,
considering they have been blown
up to as large as 6 inches by 7
inches .from the ,16mm film
negatives. That’s pretty good
technique. All pictures, in‘«Psycho

Out of the Whale by Jonah.-
Raskin, 216 pages, Links Books",
$.95. I 6

A new type of autobiography has’
appeared in the last decade. I
Formerly, most autobiographies
were written by people at the __end
of their careers.  

Books like The Autobiography of '
Malcolm X‘ changed all that. ._We
got books by controversial figures
written in the middle of their lives,
not at the end. Records of their
lives, not of their careers.-
Millett's Flying and Michael
Harrington’s Fragments of - the
Century blended pictures of their
times with frank insights into their
personal lives. ' 

Perhaps the brightest‘ develop
ment in autobiographical writing is
that it is no longer confined to
celebrities. 

Take Jonah Raskin’s Out of the
Whale. You probably haven’t
heard of Raskin, but he was a
participant in’ many important
movements. The scope of Whale is
impressive--from the Rosenbergs
to Bobby Seale; from captain of the
football team in the ’50s to radical
college professor in the ’60s.

As Raskin writes, “This book is a
social documentary, but it's also a
personal statement.” An honest
and engaging writer, Raskin offers A.
readers insights into social move- I
ments and personal relationships,

“l’ve got to be careful,” Schultz
noted _as he tucked his 6-1,
190-pound frame into his hockey
uniform. But that -isn’t to say that
Schultz plans to turn timid.

“I'll be out there throwing my

like Bobby Clarke and the other
guys,” Schultz promised. “I’ve
got to be ready in case one of them

any of our guys, but I have to be

Schultz said he’s not proud of his
penalty record. He does, however,
take pride in the penalties that he
feels he earned by hard hitting.

“It’s the bad misconduct 10
minutes or game penalties that
hurt," Schultz. explained.

“I take too many of them. It’s
ridiculous. Sure, I deserve some,
and some, no.” .'

Flyers’ Coach Fred Shero had to
caution Schultz about unnecessary
misconduct penalties‘ that were
hurting the team. And NHL
President Clarence Campbell
warned that he’d suspend Schultz
every time the winger was tossed
from a game for being abusive.

Schultz had to reform somewhat.

he’s been playing hockey.”

Schultz says he doesn’t mind all
the publicity about his tough-guy

known: ‘‘I play physical, but not

dirty._ I never hit a guy with a stick, _

only my’ fists."

Panthers’ Season Opens

with IUP Saturday

BY JAN MATTHEWS

The Pitt baseball team opens its
season tomorrow, and according to
Coach Bob_Lewis, it's none. too
soon. '

“We’re ready,” he said. “There
is only so much you can do in
practice. You have to play.”

Pitt’s opponent Indiana is playing
already. After coming back from a
12-game southern trip, Indiana
took a pair of games from Point
Park, the number-four team in the
NAIA championships one year ago.

Indiana has good pitching, but
will be hard pressed to match the
Cats’ quintet of hurlers.

Led by the starting pitcher in
tomorrow’s lid lifter, Don Siegle,
the Panthers have a veteran squad.
Four of the five are seniors,
including Siegle, and the remain-
ing one is a junior.

Siegle isn’t impressed with being

named starting pitcher for the

season’s initial contest.

‘‘It’s an honor, but you have to
expect it, being a senior. I waited
for mvchance behind some good
pitchers. Now it’s my turn,” Siegle
said. A

In addition to the pitching, the’

hitting is starting to jell.
“The pitchers always have the
edge at the beginning,” Lewis

stated. “But our hitters have
started to catch up. We’ll hit, don’t
worry about that.”

While the offensive unit has been
pronounced sound, the defensive
set cannot be deemed the same.
With fresh /blood at second and
third bases, the inﬁeld is patchy.
And with the loss of Al Webster in
the middle, the outﬁeld is none too
healthy.

Trying to stabilize the infield will
be Joe Groetsch, a shortstop with
professional potential, and Pete
Martorelli, a hard-hitting catcher.
He recently won the Blue-Gold
Award, which is given to a top
student athlete.

Lewis, ever
conﬁdent.

“We’ll do well this year. I think
we have a winner.”

Now if only the. season would
start.

Changes Needed To

Keep Pitt Hockey Alive  

BY STEVE SYBERT \

Where is collegiate hockey
headed? . ‘A
According to ,a recent survey
conducted by Jean Coyle, president
of the’ Pitt Hockey Booster Club,

thesport can go’ nowhere but up.‘

" Questionnaires were mailed to 38
colleges and universities participa-
ting ,. in the National Collegiate
Athletic Association hockey, ,pro-

" gram. The results of the survey

were surprising and the Pitt

- Athletic Department should take

heed. '

Thirty-three of the hockey pro-
grams received most of the funds
from their respective. athletic
departments. Twenty-one owned
or had access to their own rinks.
Pitt falls into neither of those
categories.

'For those teams that do not
receive money from the athletic
departments,‘the only means to get
it are through the school’s student

government or out of the pockets of

- with ‘Greg Benedetti,

the individual players. That’s the
case with Pitt.
The Panther skaters are being

"duped. The average attendance of

the surveyed schools is 2,030,

-clearly showing the extent of
hockey popularity on campus.

Somehow, Pitt Athletic Director
Casimir Myslinski has been misin-
formed. Ina November interview
Myslinski
said only New England 'and
Canadian-border states ‘have
hockey teams--giving this as his

reason for the absence of one at.
' Pitt. -

According‘ to information received
from St. Louis University, an
average of 7,500 people turn out to
see the Billikens play at the St.
Louis Arena. An additional 4,500
flock to see Denver University.
Now, anyone knows St. Louis and
Denver are nowhere near New

I England or the Canadian border.

A talented team like the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh’s should not be
playing the opponents it is now

BY HARRY HABBEL

The Pitt varsity men's tennis
team suffered defeat at the hands
of the West Virginia Mountaineers
by a score of 7-2 Wednesday at the
Hall ‘courts. The loss
dropped the Panthers’ season rec-

ord to 2-1 and raised WVU’s to

11-4.

The match was much closer than
the score indicated, however, as
three of the nine matches went the
maximum three sets. Two sets
were decided by tiebreakers.

The only singles winner for the
Cats came in the fourth position, in
which Mike Habbel outlasted Mike
Bollo 7-5, 6-2. Habbel played
superbly throughout, utilizing crisp
passing shots and consistent base-
line play to wear down his oppon-
ent. At match’s end the WVU
senior looked completely exhaust-
ed, taking enormous amounts of

A time between points to catch has p
breath, and was unable to play his

usually aggressive game.

The Panthers’ other win came at
the third doubles slot; Scott Luther
and Dave Wulkan gained the
victory by scores of 3-6, 7-6, 6-4.

Trailing 5-6 in the second set, the

duo suddenly exploded, "breaking
service to tie the set at six, then
playing clutch tennis in the tie-
breaker to win 7-6. Their moment-
um carried through to the third set
to give Pitt the win.

In the number-one singles
match, Pitt’s Joe Kantor met
Mountaineer sophomore Eddie

Parker, with Parker posting a hard I

fought 7-5, 6-3 win. Both players
used an attacking, offensive’ style
that produced many exciting
rallies. '

Tom Current met" WVU’s Jack
Longstreet in the number-two slot,

‘which ended in a long, tough,

three-set win for Longstreet; 6-2,
3-6, 6-1. -

The turning point came in the
third set with Current trailing 1-2
and serving.

“I missed a ridiculously easy
volley at the net that gave him the
service break,” Current said. “It
was all downhill after that.”

The losses for Kantor and Current
were their ﬁrst this season.

George Dieffenbach, who owns
Pitt's best career record (24-8), was
victimized by WVU’s Greg Smith at
number three, 7-5, 6-1, in a match
that was pretty much West Vir-
ginia’s after the ﬁrst set. Dieffen-
bach’s seasonal record is 2-1.

Gary Mosso broke into the singles
lineup at number six, but on a bad
note for Pitt. ~ Sam Curry of West
Virginia defeated Mosso 6-2, 6-2,
in a match in which the Cat netter
was never really able to get going.

In the ﬁrst doubles, Kantor and

Current put forth a strong effort, ‘

but the three-set encounter ended
up 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 in favor of WVU.
Battling -late-aftemoon tempera-
tures as low as 40 degrees and a
stiff shoulder that hampered Cur-

'rent’s serving, ‘the two netters

fought gamely.
At number two, Mike Habbel and

' Dieffenbach‘ played another close

one, ﬁnally losing a heartbreaker,
7-6, 7-5.

All of the close matches seemed to
swing toward WVU, perhaps due to
the fact Wednesday's match was
the ﬁfteenth of the season for

_ WVU, but only the third for Pitt.
