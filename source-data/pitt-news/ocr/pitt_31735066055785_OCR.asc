Council split on Bigelow closing

'By Benjamin Jackson

For The Pitt News

Yesterday the City Council held a
preliminary vote on the test closing
of Bigelow Boulevard. This commit-
tee vote was divided, -with four in

favor of the test closing, four against

and one abstention.

The final vote will be held next
Tuesday, at which point the decision
will be made about whether to pro-
ceed with the trial closing or to leave
Bigelow Boulevard open.

The Student Government Board had
made plans to go to yesterday’s meet-
ing. Only three members were able to

‘go. Board Members Keith Campbell

and Marc Friedberg, along with Brian
Heffron, the chair of the
Governmental Relations Committee,
attended the meeting.

“They’re not looking at it on the
basis of the evidence,” Friedberg
said. “All the evidence that the city
has offered is indifferent. All the city
wants is a test. All the opinions given
by the councilmen like Jim Ferlo is
based on his opinions.” '

Jim Ferlo, the president of the City
Council, has been opposed to the
closing from the beginning. In ’a con-
stituent letter on April 2, Ferlo said
that the closing would “not only
force the re—routing of almost 100
buses and over 15,000 vehicles per
day, it will shut down a major ambu-
lance route ...” He continued to
oppose the closing yesterday.

Councilman Bob O’Connor did not
vote either way on the bill.
According to Pittspokesperson Ken
Service, O’Connor would consider
supporting the closing depending on

A walk in the park

how two ‘issues were resolved. The
first was whether the Burger King
site on Fifth Avenue could be turned
into a metered parking lot to make up
for the spaces lost on Bigelow. The
second issue is the fact that there is
no parking on Forbes Avenue during
rush hour. If the -parking could be
restored, he would switch his vote.
Councilwoman Valerie McDonald,
a Pitt alumna, voted against the mea-
sure. She would consider changing
her vote, according to Governmental
Relations Committee Chair Brian
Heffron, if she saw a unified front
from Pitt students. 6 _
The SGB has been lobbying for the

test closing ‘since its proposal. As

part of its efforts to determine what
kind of support the test closing had,
it circulated a memo to various

All landlords have not been created equal

By Carrie Hannan

For The Pitt News

Whilestudent housing and landlord
problems are prevalent in the areas
surrounding Pitt’s campus, not every
rental experience has to be a night-
mare. Believe it or not, there are
good landlords in Oakland.

Glickman Realty owns six buildings
(36 fully furnished units) in South
Oakland, 99 percent of which are
rented to students.

Glickman Realty has a repairman
available 24 hours and has one head
property manager and two assistants
supervising 100 buildings as opposed
to‘ three supervisors to 400 buildings.

According to Cheryl Buchewicz, a
real estate agent for Glickman for 33
years, “We want to take care of our
clients. It’s not our responsibility to
take care of them, it’s just the way we
do business.”

“They were better than any other
landlords in the three years I lived
off-campus,” said Danielle Kowach, a
22-year-old Pitt student.

McKinney/Ringham Realty, owner
of Camelot Apartments in North
Oakland, is another landlord that
takes care of its tenants. “We take the
time and care to provide the best,”
said Nancy McGartland, vice—presi-
dent of McKinney/Ringham Realty.

At Camelot Apartments, the build-

ing supervisor lives on the premises.
‘‘In case something goes wrong, he is
always available,” said McGartland.
“Because the complex is mostly
female, he is there to help out with
car trouble or if one of the tenants is
having trouble with a boyfriend or

something like that.”

Camelot also provides routine
inspections of the apartments every
three months to make sure that every-
thing is in working order, even if they
have not received any calls. This
keeps problems to a minimal level.

The extra security and prompt. c_ar-
ing services offered by these real
estate companies do not come cheap.

Housing
date bac

By Mora Mvoris
For The Pitt News

To what can Pitt’s housing
shortage be attributed? Many
problems facing students and
Oakland residents alike can be
traced back to the 1960s, the
years of Pitt’s expansion.

Pitt experienced an enormous.
growth between 1966 and 1976.
The university acquired
2,000,000 square feet of space,
600,000 of which were either
under or set aside for construc-
tion. By l977, one-third of the
Oakland campus had been relo-
cated.

Also, in 1966, Pitt became a
state. school, which meant that the
state of Pennsylvania contributed
to the school’s. budget while
allowing Pitt to lower its tuition.
Because of lower tuition costs, as
well as a national emphasis on
higher education, Pitt’s enroll-
ment skyrocketed. And Pitt was
not prepared for such an increase
as the current housing, parking

_ and traffic problems demonstrate.

Asa result of these problems,
tension erupted between Pitt and
the Oakland community. In 1968,

for example, the ﬁrst master plan ,

for the university called for the

roblems
to '60s

condemning of all homes from
Forbes Avenue to Bates Street. It
also wanted to destroy Bouquet
Street and proposed building
Forbes Quadrangle along
Oakland Avenue.

This plan did not sit well with
many Oakland residents, who
were upset by Pitt’s expansion.
The community group, People’s
Oakland, protested and was suc-
cessful in getting Pitt to negotiate
with Oakland residents. Even
though there is now a dialogue
between the two groups, new
projects are generally not wel-
comed by Oakland residents.

Even Pitt’s Master Space Plan,
which attempts to lead Pitt into
the 21st century falls short of
expectations. The plan empha-
sizes areas of agreement with the
local community but doesn’t ade-
quately address the housing prob-
lem.

Because Pitt cannot provide
sufficient housing, students are
forced off—campus landlords have
discovered they can charge high
prices and neglect maintenance.
Considering the prices for renting
in Oakland are up to $150 higher
than in other city neighborhoods,
students are not getting quality or
safety for their money.

Oakland businesses to ask
whether they were in favor
of, opposed to or indiffer-
ent to the closing. Among
those in favor of the clos-
ing are Hair Friends,
Goodies, Uncle Sam's Subs
and Supercuts. Steven
Brenner, from Supercuts,
wrote in response that
“Most anything that
improves Pitt will be good
for us small-business own-
ers in the long run.”

Another business that is
in favor of the closing is
Bobby O’s. The restaurant
is owned by Councilman

Bob O’Connor’s wife. The *

O’Connor family also owns
the Roy Rogers which is in
the Cathedral of
Learning. -
Those opposed include
the Original Hot Dog Shop
and CJ Barney’s — neither
of which have returned a
survey, according to SGB
member Marc Friedberg.
Both have expressed their
opposition, however. “They
have to understand that stu-
dents make up the economy

of these businesses,”
Friedberg said.

Next Tuesday, the SGB
will go to the City Council
meeting for the final vote.
The meeting will be held at
10 a.m. SGB is trying to
organize a group of stu-
dents to be in attendance

Landlords
-Frompagel
It is critical that you actu-
ally go with the landlord or
rental agent to inspect the
apartment. What the rental
agent considers a large one
bedroom might be your
equivalent of a walk-in

‘ closet.

There are many concerns
to keep in mind when you
are inspecting potential
apartments. Check to make
sure that they are in decent
condition. If, for example,
the window in the security

THE PITT

WE'RE SINGING TH.
AT TONIG  

door is broken and replaced
with paper, it is not secure.
Also inspect the apartment
door for an adequate lock
and dead-bolt.

Make sure the hallways
are well-lit and that fire
and smoke detectors are
installed. Ask if the build-
ing has a fire escape, and if
it doesn’t, find out the
location of the nearest
emergency exit.

Ask the landlord which
utilities are included in the
rent and find out the aver-

   

age cost per month of utili-
ties that aren’t included. If
heat is included, find out
who controls the heat and
when it is turned on. If
there are radiators, make
sure that they are in work-
ing condition.

It is also important that
you ask the landlord if the
apartment will be fumigat-
ed after the current tenants
move out and how often the
building is fumigated.

Look for any obvious
signs of damage to the

apartment and see if the
landlord is willing to make
repairs. While you are in
the apartment, check to
make sure that the refriger-
ator, stove and plumbing
are in working order. Make
sure that the windows have
locks and that they open
and shut. .

Other things to ask about
are the availability of park-
ing and laundry facilities.

ment’s proximity to campus

Once you find your
dream apartment, there are
a few more steps to take to
protect yourself. Know
your legal rights before
signing your lease. There
are many free legal and
tenant help services that
can advise you, and they
will help you understand
the terms of the lease.

To ensure that your apart-
ment is habitable, call
Pittsburgh’s Bureau of
Building Inspection’s
Assistant Chief Ron
Graziano. “Before moving,
call us to check out the
apartment,” Graziano said.

According to Terry
Milani, associate director
of the Office of Student
Activities, Property
Management recently nego-
tiated with the city about
paying half of the salary of
a new inspector for student
housing starting next year.

“It’s a joint effort
between the university and
the city to assist in the
community,” said John
DeVitto, associate vice
chancellor for business.
“We want to improve
Oakland, and that makes it
much better for the stu-
dents.”

  Opinions  

Living in an Oakland box

Exploding stoves? Falling sinks? Who has ever heard of this
kind of thing? College students, that’s who. If you have made the
decision to live off-carnpus, you are probably quite familiar with
leaking ceilings, faulty wiring, frozen pipes, clogged drains or
any number of apartment disasters.

And one other thing you are probably well associated with. is
absentee landlords — those stealth businessmen hiding in the
shadows, of whom’s existence you have no physical proof. You
might hear from these specters once in a great while — when,
for instance, your rent istwo days late or you forgot to take your
garbage out to the curb. But don’t expect to hear from them if
you need something repaired or if you need six feet of snow
removed from the front of your door.

The exception is, of course, when the lease is almost up. Then
you will find your landlord knocking on your door just as you
step into the shower (or any number of other “indisposed”
moments) to let strangers examine the underwear hanging from
your ceiling fan. You can then be guaranteed that you will hear
from said landlord within two days about the disgraceful condi-
tion of your apartment. ,

To top this all off, you can expect to pay an exorbitant amount
of money for a room the size of a closet. What you see in the
paper advertised as a “studio” or an “efficiency” is usually some-
thing too small to walk in once a bed and a desk are added.
“Furnished” usually means whatever the last tenant didn’t want
to keep, and the condition of it is rarely better than sub-standard.
Many landlords in the area are requiring tenants to pay utilities,
including any combination of gas, electric, water, sewage and
garbage collection. By the time you total your bills at the end of
the month, it is not uncommon to pay $500+ for an apartment.

One of the major problems with renting apartments in the
Oakland area is that, frequently, students do not know their
rights. Before you sign a lease, read it. Know exactly what is

(and is not) included with your agreement. Also, before you sign.

a lease, check the apartment as many times as is necessary. Call
the landlord 46 times if you have to, but make sure everything
works before you accept a lease. Even though a landlord is tech-
nically required to provide maintenance, once you sign you may
find yourself stuck with it in the exact condition that you got it.
Check at the Commuter Resource Center to seeif any complaints
have been filed against your prospective landlord.

You should also know that, even if you have signed a lease,
you do still have legal rights when it comes to dealing with your
landlord. There are a number of free legal services available for
students. Cut out the list of phone numbers in yesterday’s The
Pitt News and hang on to it. If you have a problem with your
landlord, don’t be afraid to use these resources. I

If you are reading this, you can
thank Norma Jean McCann.

Mrs. McCar1n gets most of the
credit for my becoming a writer.
She was my English teacher at
Wilkinsburg High in suburban
Pittsburgh and the faculty advisor

for the yearbook, for which I

wrote. She was definitely the
toughest teacher I ever had; I
don’t think I made higher than a
C in her courses. I remember
many times being frustrated and
thinking, “I’m going to get an A
on one of her assignments if it’s
the last thing I do.”

Which is what she wanted,
because aftershe got through
with me, writing became a breeze
—- and eventually ,a passion.

Yet soon after I graduated,
nearly 17 years ago, she left
teaching. You see, a lot of parents
hated her, as she was demanding,
outspoken and independently
minded. Some also unfairly con-
sidered her a racist — a big deal
in a school which was then about
60 percent black.

I thought of Mrs. McCann
upon reading a recent article in

U. S. News and World Report‘

called “Why Teachers Donft
Teach.” it suggested that the
biggest problem in American
education these days is teachers’
unions playing politics with the
schools.

Truth is, if the unions are play-
ing politics, it’s because the pub-
he started it.

Over the past 50 years,
Americans have actually misused
the very process of education. We
use learning not as an end in itself
but as a means —— i. e. gloriﬁed
job-training. I mean, why excel if
you know that a high-paying job
will be waiting for you once you
finished no matter how poorly
you have performed in class?
That’s the real reason that some
teachers don’t teach; kids often
aren’t supposed to learn for leam-
ing’s sake.

Learning, for me, didn’t stop
once I left the classroom.
Recently I talked with my moth-
er, about to retire from teaching,
about some of the things my

 

Rick
Nowlin

brother and I played during our
childhood. We both did sports
and watched theater and sympho-
ny performances and a now-
defunct marionette troupe in
Shadyside. I also studied music
and language. Learning was fun
then, but when it came to “get—
ting the big job” with resultant
perks and privileges, it became a
bore. ,

I bring this up because folks
want to find simple solutions to
complex problems. They think
that, in this case, once we get rid
of teachers’ unions (or at least
limit their power), we can do
something to improve the
schools. Don’t waste your time
with that nonsense —- unions
have nothing to do with the prob-
lem.

For example, the so-called
“Turner Initiative” in
Wilkinsburg is a disaster, as the
school reportedly has already

ﬁred three teachers (one for, of all

things, defending himself against
a student), and three more have
written a letter to the private
company running the school
about how Tumer is “a crisis situ-
ation.” (Of course, the 24 mem-
bers of the Wilkinsburg
Education Association who were
let go knew that already.)
Besides, the real impetus for the
privatization wasn’t about educa-
tional achievement anyway -— it
had to do with a school board
member’s vendetta against a
Turner teacher.

School choice? It’s fundamen-
tally unjust, because it punishes
lower-income households for not
having the money to send their
children to private schools.

The hard truth about education reform  

Merit pay? No way. Its sup-
porters don’t realize that it
rewards popularity as much as
teaching skills and, thus, leads to
political chicanery. If merit pay
were available in the Wilkinsburg
School District, Mrs. McCann
would never have been nominat-
ed, simply because people didn’t
like her. What’s worse, parents
with power (e.g. school board
members) will certainly do their
level best to make sure their chil-
dren get the class with the “good
teacher” — at the expense of
everyone else. And then there’s
the reality of “tracking,” where
students are grouped according to
ability. Who really wants to teach
lower achievers?

Principals being in charge?
Again, more politics. A friend of
mine who teaches in a Christian
academy has that problem. She
told me that her principal told
her, to her face, that he wanted to
get rid of her for no good reason
but that the school board over-
ruled him. (Now you understand
why teachers ﬁght fortenure.)

And let’s not forget the biggest
obstacles. to reform — the par-
ents. Both the NEA and the APT
have wisely been calling for
decades for more parental
involvement, as they feel their
jobs would be easier and more
productive. Usually, however.
one of two things happens: Either
the parent curses out (or even
strikes) the teacher for having to
take time out to come to school at
all, or the parent seems to think
that not only can he or she can do
a better job but even tries to tell
the teacher what to teach.

I don’t know where Mrs.
McCann is now, but I can’t
blame her for leaving the class-

room. If good teachers quit the _

profession altogether, as many
do, it’s because education has
become about adultstrying to
pull rank on each other and not
about teaching children. No cos-

metic “reforms” can change that. ’

Piﬂ neﬂers lop Duquesne, 5-4

By Nichole Gantshar
Staff Writer

Columnist

Duncan

xpansion, coupled

with owners playing

musical-cities with
franchises, have enabled
sports to reach new depths
of idiocy.

Put bluntly, the new team
nicknames surfacing suck.

Come on, the Baltimore
Ravens? Or the Arizona
Diamondbacks, or the
Phoenix Coyotes?

If it wasn’t bad enough
that Cleveland lost its foot-
ball team to Baltimore, now
its beloved Browns will be
the Ravens. And why?
Because Edgar Allen Poe
was buried there. That’s
about the most absurd thing
I’ve ever heard. I guess
Baltimore is trying to culture
fans with its reference to
Poe’s famous poem, “The
Raven.” How about some-
thing simple for us simple-
minded fans like the
Baltimore Crab Cakes? The
name is pretty catchy and
the team emblem would be
pretty cool. Plus, the team
colors (brown and white)
would be a hot marketing
tool since the Browns are
now defunct.

Recently, baseball has had
its share of shady names.
Out of the four expansion
teams in three years, only
the Florida Marlins are
acceptable. The Colorado
Rockies are too obvious and
the Arizona Diamondbacks
and the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays are downright dumb.
Oh, I get it, Arizona has a
lot of snakes in its desert.
But why the Diamondbacks
-— the name won’t even fit
on thejersey? How about
something more convention-
al. like the Arizona Dry
Heat. The emblem could be
an old, teal and purple (to
make it more marketable)
shriveled—up man with his
ﬂesh burning to the bone.

Apparently Arizona has
had its problems picking
team names. After the
Winnipeg Jets decided to
move to Phoenix at the end
of this hockey season,
Arizona’s braintrust came up
with the Coyotes. Come on,
get off the desert fix already.
There’s something called 9

The Panther tennis team
defeated Duquesne 5-4 at a
dual match held at the
Monroeville Racquet Club.
Pitt now stands 11-7 for the
season.

“It’s a good rivalry with
Duquesne,” said Head Coach
George Dieffenbach. “We
had not beaten Duquesne for
the last two years so it’s
good to get back to beating
them again.”

The Panthers had to wait‘

until the last match between
senior Marla Zielinski and
the Dukes’ Noelle Janczak to
settle the match. Pitt was tied
4-4.

Zielinski had j'ust come off
a doubles tournament with
sophomore Fran Davis. They
had lost 8-5 and Zielinski
had had trouble getting her
rhythm set. Then she lost the
first singles set to Janczak,
0-6.

“She was c_oming to the net
a lot and forcing it,” said
Dieffenbach. “Marla was not
in position and [was] making
errors at the net.”

Zielinski began to fight in
the second set. By winning
the set 7-6, she pushed for a
third and deciding set.

“Marla is a very deter-
mined athlete,” said
Dieffenbach. “She became
more patient.”

As the second game pro-
gressed, Zielinski became

more selective in her timing
on returning the ball.
“She chose the right time

-to hit hard and that made all

the difference,” said
Dieffenbach. “Marla played
intelligent tennis to win the
match for us.”

Zielinski won the last set
6-0‘ and claimed the meet
victory for the Panthers.

Pitt needed the wins in sin-
gles to recover from a disap-
pointing set of doubles
matches. Freshmen Jen Bible
and Kristen Siegel lost to
Duquesne’s Mariana Gundin
and Bridgette Johns, 8-4.

The only Panther doubles
victory came from the team
of freshman Erin Shalbrack
and senior Alison Baker.
They out swung Duquesne’s
Janczak and Anne Baker 8-3.
Dieffenbach has been
pleased with the team all
season.

“It was consistency and a
combination of being aggres-
sive,” said Dieffenbach.
“Baker sets up a lot of shots
and Shalbrack put away a lot
of balls.”

Davis had to follow up a
loss in doubles with a match
against one of the best play-
ers in the East, the Dukes’
Mariana Gundin. Davis lost
again 6-0, 6-0.

“There aren’t many players
in the East who could beat
her. She has great ground
strokes,” said Dieffenbach.
The match was still impor-

Top QB, receiver,

are up for grabs

By Kevin Lilley
Staff Writer

The Blue-Gold scrimmage, Pitt football’s annual spring
showcase, is set for this Saturday at Pitt Stadium. Kickoff
is at 1:30 p._m., with alumni events and autograph sessions
scheduled before and after the game.

The 39 returning lettermen and therest of the Panther
roster will be vying for slots in the Panther lineup that
will be open for the first time in years.

The newly open positions include wide receiver. where
the departure of Dietrich Jells leaves seniors Curtis

post. Quarterback is also available. as theloss of John-
Ryan throws the job open to redshirt junior Pete Gonzalez
and southpaw sophomore Matt Lytle. _

These emerging Panthers, and more familiar names like
running backs Billy West and Demetrius Harris, will lead
the Panther offense versuspthe Panther defense in
Saturday’s contest. The squads will not be split for this
go-round, giving the coaches more opportunity to work
with the entire unit on both sides of the ball.

“What we’ve done is devised a point system,” said Jim
Earle, the assistant athletic director of football operations.
“If the defense stops the offense, the defense is awarded a
point.” Offensive scoring will be the same as a regular
game.

“We think it will make the game more interesting for the

fans,” said Earle. “It’s not something we’ve done in the

By Geoff Moak
Staff Writer

The men and women of the Pitt
track team will be in an unfamiliar
place this weekend —— Pittsburgh.
The Panther Relays will be held this
Sunday at Pitt Stadium. It is the
firstof two home meets for the
Panthers this season.

This meet should provide an
excellent opportunity for Pitt ath-
letes to shine. Meet director and
Pitt Assistant Coach Dave Sobal
was a little bit disappointed in some
teams that chose not to attend, such.

out way ahead of time. I don’t want
to accuse them of avoiding us, but
we sent invitations to all the big
schools within a couple hours of
here,” Sobal said.

Even without those teams, the
field will not be short of partici-
pants. Over 15 schools will bring
athletes to the meet, from as near as
Carnegie Mellon and Robert Morris
to as far as the University of
Buffalo and Eastern Michigan
University. Plus, there will be the
perfunctory assortment of club
teams and unattached individuals
that is present at any college invita-
tional meet. —

The meet begins at 9:30 a.m. on
Sunday when the gun goes off for
the 5000-meter. The women will
run first, then the men. Sobal sees
the men’s 5000 as one of the most
competitive races of the day. ,

“It should be good, primarily
because of the post-collegians in it.

The two guys from Pitt [Ed '

Adamson and Dennis Kuntz] should

be tough,” Sobal said.

On the women’s side, the 800- .

meter will be a fast race. According
to Sobal, five women have seed
times of 2:12 or better. For compar-
ison, the best time this season for
Pitt is Angie Martin’s 2:11.24.

There will be no team scoring at
the meet, so the big competition is
for individuals.

“We’re one of the stronger teams
at this one,” Sobal said. “Pitt
should shine, but there are. individu-
als who will test us.”

The. team has travelled to
Jamaica, Alabama and Miami

already this season. Weather-wise,"

Pittsburgh just doesn’t compare to
those places. For at least this
Sunday, though, the weather should
cooperate. Sunday’s forecast calls
for cloudy skies and temperatures
around 60 degrees. With weather
fears aside, the team is generally
glad to be home for a weekend.
“This gives people who support
us locally a chance to see us,” said

senior Tonya Mullins.

Junior distance runner Matt
Samuel agreed, and he also added a
point that makes the timing of the
home meet, with finals coming up,
particularly good.

“It’s good because a lot of parents
can come to this meet. When you’re
on the road all the time, you get
tired. You can’t study,” Samuel
said.

One of the few dissenting voices

was that of Anthony Dorsett. He’s
had his share of home football
games on the Pitt Stadium turf, but
he says track is different.
' “With football-, I’m comfortable
being at home. In track, I’m used to
being at other people’s places. I’m
more comfortable there,” Dorsett
said.

The Panther Relays start at 9:30
Sunday morning and will continue
all day long. Track and jumping
events will be held in Pitt Stadium,
and throwing events will be on the

tant to Dieffenbach and he
had no question in his mind
that Davis was the player
to play against Gundin.

' “Sometimes you can
learn more from your loss-
es than your wins,” said
Dieffenbach. “Fran can see
that player make great
shots and it makes her a lit-
tle quicker.” .

The Panthers won the
rest of their singles match-
es. Shalbrack continued her

Baker also beat her Duke

The only Panther ‘singles
loss was from junior
Tamara Kalesnik, who lost
to Duquesne’s Anne Baker
6-3, 6-4.

Dieffenbach believes the
team is peaking at the right
time as‘ they lead up to the
Big East Championship on
April 18.

Pitt’s all-time record
stands at 13 wins in one
season. This year
Dieffenbach wants to try
for 14.

“We take each match one
at a time,” said
Dieffenbach. “[We] still
have some‘ work to do,
reduce our errors and
become more offensive,
working hard as a team.”

He counts on the win

yesterday to give the team
a psychological boost for
the remaining matches.
, “Anytime you pull out a
win the attitude has a lot to
do with that,” said
Dieffenbach. “It’s good
timing for us.”

Joby’s Opinion
Form Filter
Friction Media

It seems like the official cool
musical instrument is no
longer the Gibson SG, Gibson
Firebird, or even a Fender
Jaguar or Mustang. Nope.
Now, if you want to be hip, the
instrument to have is  a key-
board. In a return to their ‘80s
pasts, kids are making music
with their childhood friends
Casio and Yamaha. It seems
that after a hiatus in wack-ville,
the keyboard is safe to use
again.

Joby’s Opinion is what hap-
pens when these synthsonic-
type youngsters get together
to play some music. Coming
from the fertile‘ indie area of
Chapel Hill, N.C., these boys
draw on the influences of new
instrumental stars TransAm in
their creation of guitar- and
keyboard-driven rock music.
Basically, Joby’s Opinion uses
keyboards to add a fuzzy,
sometimes spacy quality to
their songs. _

The album starts off with
your basic indie—rock serving
of trebly guitars, fuzzy low-end

hooks, and muttered vox. As‘

the tracks advance, though,
the synth sound grows more
and more prominent. On
“Freak Magnet,” some kind of
Moogy noise augments the
basic fuzz-and-feedback
riffage. “Going to the
Olympics,” an instrumental,
shows a heavy TransAm influ-
ence with a cheeseball vocal
sample, space-age synth
noodlings, a tight, repetitive
guitar and bass riff, and nice,
in-the-pocket drumming. The
song progresses through

straight takes on the riff to a
full-bodied noisy middle.

Other highlights include
“Anthony Braxton Drawings,”
which features a Jesus Lizard-
style rhythm, albeit with a
cleaner sound. “Natty
Bohemian” is a bit long, start-
ing with a fuzzy assault with
Dr. Who-sounding keyboards.
It calms down into a Weezer-
esque high, pretty melody with
fuzzed, long-distance tele-
phone line vocals. There are
some cool freaky noises that
liven up the riffs, but it does
get a little repetitive.

Now for the downside of
Form Filter. Really, the only
beef I have with this album is
the overuse of the synth at
times. The organ-heavy “St
Peter’s Fistfight” sounds as if
the band is trying to prove
something. The point is either
going right over my head or it’s
just pointless to begin with.
Other songs are just not
inspired, going through the
same meals in the indie cook-
book repertoire we’ve eaten so
many times before. That’s not
to say the album's all bad. It's
just a little overdone at times.

On balance, Joby’s Opinion
offers up a nice mix of some
new wave-ish (or is that retro-
wave?) indie rock songs. If
nothing else, the addition of a
synth makes the songs stand
out as fresh against a back-
ground of strictly guitar-driven
bands. Along with TransAm,
Joby’s Opinion could change
the face of indie rock. Now that
it’s safe again, ‘pull out your
Casio and get ready to rock.

' they began

 

Appearing at the Bloomfield
Bridge Tavern tonight at 9
p.m. are the infamous back-
woods hillbilly noisemakers
Mule, featuring ex-members
of Laughing Hyenas and Wig.

Quarterstick Records
released their simply mind-
numbing self—titled debut in
1993, a smattering combina-
tion of rambling blues vocals
and crunchy guitars. Heavy
blues-core numbers such as
“Mississippi Breaks” and
“What Every White Nigger
Knows" easily carved for Mule
a permanent spot among the
ranks of self-destructive white
soul/rock acts along with Jon
Spencer and Tom Waits.

Mule returned in 1994 with
the powerful four-song EP
Wrung — this time with more
of a focus on urban white-
trash culture than hillbilly
angst. Their latest Long-
Player, If! Don’t Six, was also
released in 1994 and nar-
rowed in on Mule’s slower,
more reposed side of life. All
three discs, however, show-
case the undeniable attraction
of a talented band that knows
how to work within estab-
lished genres and still create
something original.

Theshow begins at 9 p.m.,
opening are Arizona’s D00
Reg and Pittsburgh power trio
Six-horse. Admission is $6
and over-21 only.

Tonight at the Tobacco
Roadhouse in South Oakland
(formerly Ribbitz, formerly the
Decade) are ultra-hip, dreamy
pop sensations the
Mommyheads.

Hailing from San Francisco,
on Simple
Machines Records with a

casette-only release of exper-
imental guitar-pop (known
only as the Swiss Army Knife
tape) with songs like “Stop
Squeezing Nipples” and
“Undress Me With Your
Golfball.” Next was Coming
Into Beauty, an organically
blended, aesthetically perfect
offering of some of the catchi-
est surreal-pop ever record-
ed.

Soon after, they left their
family at the Simple Machines
label because, as singer
Adam Cohen told me at a
performance earlier this year,
“They only cared about
Tsunami.” Well put. 1994 saw
the release of the more
upbeat Flying Suit CD on
New Jersey's Dromedary
records, an album which took
the band in a somewhat dif-
ferent direction while manag-
ing to maintain the lightweight
feel and catchy harmonies of
previous releases. Their latest
offering, Bingham’s Hole, was
released last year on Dot Dot

- Dash Records and continues

the Mommyhead tradition of
minimalist keyboard rhymes
and bitter-sweet “c|oud-core”
guitar pop. Definitely a show
not to be missed.

The Mommyheads will take
the stage around 10 p.m.;
admission is $5 and over-21
only. Opening are locals
Smoking Popes.

Working up a sweat on
Friday night at 9 p.m. is blue-
collar supergroup Golden
Smog, featuring members of
alternative-country rockers
Wilco and the Jayhawks.

Although road-weary coun-
try-pop act Wilco is a relative-
ly new creation, two of its
members have spent time in

the now classic Gram
Parson’s-esque Uncle
Tupelo. The now defunct
Jayhawks have long been
heralded as some of the more
musically and lyrically mature
members of the alternative-
country genre; their final
album Tomorrow the Green
Grass found itself on “favorite
albums of the year” lists
among both country and rock
critics alike.

According to Seattle’s alter-
native-country magazine No
Depression, the Golden
Smog project translates well
onstage. Their debut album
Down By the Old Mainstream
suggests the collaboration
was a success; country-rock
fans should expect to get their
money's worth as some of the
best in the business collabo-
rate for the first time ever in
front of a Pittsburgh audience.

Lately, I've heard the term
“indie punk” thrown around
quite a lot in reference to new
bands. If you’d like a sonic def-
inition of this made-up term,
Chisel is a ban_d who could

‘ help you out. Evocative of

Superchunk and classic pop,
their pure-fun approach melds
balls-out punk melodies with
poppy restraint and catchy
hooks.

Chisel, who hail from D.C.
and feature a member of
Heartworm, supposedly have
the mop-top look going on and
have even been described to
me as mod by some listeners.
But just because these guys
know how to dress snappy and
can get some hip swing on the
dancefloor does not mean that
they are the Small Faces, Part
II. Instead, their style is heavily
influenced by Superchunk’s
brand of catchy riffs and

pubescent-sounding vocal

F squawks. At first, you might

think “cover band,” or worse
yet, “rip off.”' However, the
vocals are the part of the
sound which most resemble
Chapel Hill’s favorite sons, and
the music is indeed diverse
enough to be original. The
vocals are more high strung,
and the music less punk. In all,
the sound is a good fusion of
two influences.

The lead track on the disk,

“Hip Straights,” starts off with
some good tortured singing,
and a fierce bassy guitar
assault. Mere seconds later (in
the sub-three-minute song
pop/punk tradition), however,
the band has launched into a
singalong fingersnappin’
bridge. Both riffs are seam-
lessly married into a great
song.

“What About Blighty” is
another punky blast, going all
out for under three minutes of
melodic enjoyment. “Your Star
is Killing Me,” by contrast, has
little punk feel. lt’s a poppier,
sometimes Brit-feeling,

lovelorn song. Somehow the
music melds with the happily-
unrequited lyrics to create a
love song that is neither sappy
nor depressing. Here Chisel
seems at its most adept,

grooving right along in a way

that almost makes you want to
dance.

The title -track, “8 a.m. All
Day,” has lyrical content that is
as somber as the title might
suggest (I don’t know about
you, but 8 a.m. is not my
favorite time to be awake). But
the musical approach hardly
sounds like the band just
climbed out of bed. It rocks
happily just as hard as the rest
of the album. Nice final touch-
es to the album are the organ
and trumpet interludes
between, and included in,
some tracks.

To sum it up, Chisel is worth
a look if you’re out for some
upbeat melodic pop/punk
stylings with some indie sensi-
bility. No band is 100 percent
original, but some manage to

Triple Fast Action '

Emily Ryan Lerner is a comic
artist in high school in New
York City who has put out a
couple of zines and had a page
in Action Girl, an all-female
comic anthology that’s just
fantabulous. So when she sent
me a postcard a couple of
months ago telling me that she
had a new comic zine out that
her mom said was the best one
yet, I gladly put an old dollar bill
in an envelope and sent it off to
her. I was not disappointed. As
Tony the Tiger might say, “Nice
Catch#1? It's greatl”

The art is very simple and
cartoony, yet still expressive. I
really liked the use of blacks; it
made the pages seem full.
White space tends to look
empty, but for some reason,
black space doesn’t have the
same effect. But enough art
theory. The comics are all very
short, with the longest being
three pages. There is an auto-
biographical slant to them, but
they are not strict autobiogra-
phy. The zine’s centerpiece is a
strip about how the narrator

wants to be homecoming
queen. Because she lives in
New York City, she feels like
she missed out on stereotypical
high school experiences like
drag racesand make-out ses-
sions in cats. To get it, send $1
to EmilyiFiyan Lernerl P.O. Box

The first time I saw MTV’s
“S~ingIed Out” back in
November was revelatory;
ever since that day I have
wanted to be a contestant on
that show. Alas, the show is
taped in southern California,
and stuck here in Pittsburgh,
I’ve got no chance to be on it.
So, I turned to the next best
thing: personal ads. What bet-
ter way to meet total strangers
and have brief relationships
with them, founded on the
basis of arbitrary criteria? The
City Paper and In Pittsburgh
personal ad sections seemed
to be my best bets, as they
would probably be read by a
wider variety of people than
any other local forum I could
choose. Also, placing the ads
and telephone retrieval of
messages was free, although
City Paper charged me $15 for
mail forwarding service. City
Paper gave me a mere twenty
words to sum up the essence
of my being in such a manner
as to make myself attractive to
members of the opposite sex.

This is what I wrote: “R|OT
BOY-SWM, 21, writing stu-
dent. Someday, l’|I be famous.
Into punk scene, drawing and
reading comics, Red Dwarf,
museums. Non-Drinker, Non-
smoker. Seeks compatible
female.” In Pittsburgh gave me
30 words to play with, so I
wrote: “RIOT BOY- SWM, 21,
writing student. Into museums,
comics, parks. Last week, my
Punk band played to a church
full of senior citizens. Seeking
Female to share moments like
these.” »

In Pittsburgh sent their form
letter back to me first. The let-
ter said my ad would first
appear in print on February 14,
but the letter was postmarked
for February 23, so obviously,
it didn’t appear when they said
it first would. The letter started
out “You’re well on your way
to meeting someone
special.” Included with my let-
ter was a certificate good for
two passes to a movie that I
had never heard of, in a movie
theater that I had never heard
of, in a neighborhood that I
didn’t know how to get to." I felt
like a dork; not only did I need
In Pittsburgh to help me meet
people, but I needed them to
plan out my dates for me as
well. Also with the letter was a
photocopied, and hard to read,
handwritten checklist of things
to do, reminding me to record
my message immediately, and
only check my messages once
aday. Still, my eagerness
outweighed my apprehension,
so that night, with the sound of
my neighbors doing it in the
background, I called up the
800 number to record my
greeting. I said basically the
same things I said in my ad,
then I was led through a series

01 very general questions (like
age, education, etc.) by a
pleasantly bland female voice.
On the basis of these ques-
tions, I was matched up with
the only other person in the
database who matched my cri-
teria. Not a good sign. I had
the option to call that person
(and pay to do so), but I decid-
ed that I would wait to see
what responses I got first.
Besides, if I had the option to
call her, she had the option to
call me. (Although, in retro-
spect, it’s this kind of thinking
that keeps me dateless.) After
that, I listened to my astrologi-
cal profile, which lasted 30
seconds and was incredibly
vague. I was given the option

of adding this to my voice mail
greeting, which I did.

One of my worries when I
placed my personal ads was
getting lots of replies from
scary people, and having to
turn them down. Silly me. The
day after I recorded my mes-
sage, I called to see if I had
any replies. I had none.
Repeat this cycle for the first
two weeks the ad ran. By this
point, my enthusiasm was
somewhat dampened, but I
went through the process of
recording a voice mail mes-
sage for people to reply to
again, trying desperately to
sound calm and happy. From
this point on, I quit checking
my In Pittsburgh messages,

 

April 1 1 1 996

until the day before my voice
mailbox expired. At that point, I
still had no messages. I
checked my City Paper mes-
sages every couple of days for
a while, but I didn’t receive any
replies from them either. Nor
did I receive any mall.

80 I sent a letter to City
Paper. I wrote: “Dear Sir or
Madam, I paid $15 for mail for-
warding service for my
Romantic Connections ad. As I
received no forwarded mail, I
would like my $15 refunded.”
As of now, I have not gotten
any reply. Which is fitting, in a
way. .

When I think back on it, the
majority of the personal ads in
these two publications seem to
be from middle-aged people
and S and M freaks. I mean,
geez, Kathy Jo Kramer wrote
about meeting a policeman
from a personal ad. Do I really
need to meet these kinds of
people? People my age don’t
seem to use these services.
They don’t have to; in college,
you meet lots of people all the
time. Why would you need to
use an ad to meet more peo-
ple? The thing I learned is that
I have to do the work of meet-
ing people and all the awkward
parts that go along with it
myself; no newspaper ad is
going to magically produce my
punk-rawk dream girl. Now, if I

Ten Years Later
Matador Records

Dropped from a major label
like a student dropping a class
on the last day of add/drop,
Tommy Keene's Ten Years
Later shows that the major
labels lost a sleeper.

A decade ago, Keene’s
“Song From The Film” was
released on Geffen Records
and the song, “Places That Are
Gone” won the overall approval
from college radio. Charmed by
his organized guitar riffs and
coffee shop lyrics, he was
called the “thinking man's
Replacements.”

“Going Out Again” and “Silent 
Town” has Keene campaigning 
for another college gem.

God Street Wine

‘Red 4

Mercury

The backwoods New York
group, God Street Wine, put
their positive vibes onto a CD
that combines the five-man
band’s various sounds into a

healthy, rambunctious crowd. I
was impressed with the strong
animation of the group’s per-
formance and lively antics that
kept my attention throughout
the show. They got the whole
place stomping their feet and
clapping their hands with a
musical energy flow. The CD
carries out that same verve
using reggae and southern
lyrical attributions.

GSW kicked off their tour in
Philadelphia at the beginning
of April and will be playing at
Metropol next Thursday, April
18th.

Two Dollar Guitar
Burned and Buried

Oil City Recordings/Smells
Like Records

Here are some more gloomy
songs by former Half-
Japanese guitar-playing
mopehead Tim Foljahn, other-
wise known as The Man Who
Would Be Calvin, and his not-
so-merry band, consisting of
Dave Motamed on bass and
Sonic Youth’s loveable Steve
Shelley on drums.

Two Dollar Guitar’s epony-
mous debut CD was put out
last year by Shelley's Smells
Like Records, and I would say
that this record picks up where
that one left off. Foljahn is the
reigning king of poetic deep-
bass drone, especially since
Calvin Johnson has been pur-
suing his happy-go-disco con-
cerns with Dub Narcotic and
Halo Benders.

Foljahn made some noise at
Luciano’s last year, hyping up
the crowd for Two Foot Flame

harmonious blend. Moving from F   :1

NYC to the NY country sup-
plied GSW with the inspiration '
to produce Fied. Unlike their=
previous tracks, Red is more,
free and loose. The group has.
matured from a garage band:
into a solid, soulful ensemble. ,
The first track, “Get On That
Train,” starts the «CD off with a

.- rich, instrumental shuffle. The

pleasant groove that GSW cre-

I ates with this tune is character-

istic of much of their music. The

:rack, “Red and Milky,” take the
excitement down in an acoustic
melody of a sensuous woman.
The following song, “RU4
Real?” also uses the influences
of a woman and her playful
love games. The song picks up:
the flow of the compilation and
uses a synthesized rhythm.
Gospel harmonies beautify
the song “Untitled Take Two”
that calls out to an angel “To

Kiss.” Although this piece is
short, it compliments the
honky-tonk blues of “Chop!”
This is one of the most fun
tracks they've produced. They
give a fresh twang to a ballad
about gettin’ up and choppin’ a‘
cherry tree down. The rest of
the CD carries out the splashy
GSW style of experimenting

with different approaches and _
. melodies.

The band has a strong follow-

ing that accompanies their -

upbeat music and personality.

Using their merriment, the

group lifts the audience’s spirits
and gets them to raise their
hands in the air. I caught these
guys at Graffiti the last time
they were in town playing for a

and the release of the film
Half-Cooked, and made his
major-label debut in ‘95 when
he played alongside Uncle
Thurston on Moore's Psychic
Hearts solo debut on Geffen.

Certain moments on this
record sound a lot like they
were unused outtakes from
the Psychic Hearts Sessions,
but I guess that's what hap-
pens when you've got the
same guitar player and drum-
mer (Shelley plays on Moore's
record also) making up two-
thirds of two different trios.
The difference here is that,
unlike Moore, Foljahn does not
seem concerned with making
a catchy rock record; he is
simply pouring out the liquid
remains of his black heart into
a suitably charred mold.

This is a concept album in
the sense that it never lets up;

7

it doesn’t release the listener
from its grip of depression until
it has run its course. Two
Dollar Guitar is the rock ‘n’ roll
equivalent of the art of some-
one like Joseph Beuys. Blood,
mud, fat tissue and sinew are
all equally represented in a no-
bullshit forum that is alchemi-
cal and, at the same time, cyn-
ical about the potential results.
“The impromptu Ballad of a
Male S|ut” and “Black Star’ are
particular gems. lf Robert
Smith ever had any balls he
would have made records like
this one. I would recommend
listening to it anytime you’re all
doped up and can't get off
your couch; it surely beats
watching television, and it
might actually provoke an
emotional response, if you let
it.

into these names —— like the
Phoenix Cheese Doodles.

Team names haven’t been
exempt from the stream of
political correctness that’s
flowing through society.
First it was the St. John’s
Redmen, and now it’s the
Washington Bullets.
Apparently, the name Bullets
connote street violence and
gun use. So Washington offi-
cials are changing the name
to the Wizards. Now, I don’t
have a problem with the
Wizards, but how about
something more appropriate
—— the Washington
Bloodsuckers or the
Washington Weasels.

But what I don’t under-
stand is how a name like the
New Jersey Devils slips
through the politically cor-
rect cracks. Here’s a team
that pays homage to Satan
himself and his followers.
There’s something wrong
here. Don’t get me wrong, I
totally endorse dark names
like the Devils, there should
be more like ‘em, but how
come there’s not a team
called the California Christs.
That would be the only way
to represent both sides fairly,
because after all, a Padre
can’t do crap to Satan.

Another thing I can’t fig-
ure out is why there are
duplicate team names like
the Giants, Cardinals and
Panthers. These names aren’t
remotely clever or original,
so it makes no sense that two
teams share a name.

I have the perfect solution.
The New York Giants will
remain the same, and change
the San Francisco Giants to
the San Francisco Gerbils.
Let Arizona keep the
Cardinals because we
already know that Arizoners
are clueless with team
names, and change St. Louis
to the St. Louis Busch (hey,
everything else in St. Louis
is named after Busch).

And for the Carolina and

Florida Panthers, they both

need to scrap their name.
Because as we all know, no
team named the Panthers
will ever win in anything.
