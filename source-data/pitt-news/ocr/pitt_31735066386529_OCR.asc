to protest omimozl abuses

According to Cooper, Gillette
does tests with animals to protect
itself in the event of a lawsuit.

“If their products harm
somebody, they can say, ‘Well,
we tested it on animals,”’ said
Cooper. He’ added that the
purpose of these tests is to see if
any product might be harmful to
humans, but that “animal results
don’t correlate with human
results.” i

Other possible test methods
are the skin—culture and test—tube
tests. These methods simply
involve a few human— skin cells
and are harmless, according to
Krill.

“These are better and more
accurate than the outdated animal
tests,” said Krill.

The trend in product testing is
moving away from the use of
animals, said Krill. She added
that other cosmetics companies,
like Revlon, Avon and the parent
company of Estee Lauder have
stopped using animals.

“There are so many companies
that don’t do it that it shows that
it is not necessary,” said Krill.

Krill and Cooper said they were

pleased with student participation ‘

in the boycott.

“People have been
responsive,” said Cooper.

Friends of Animals‘ last project
was an information table in the
T owers' lobby that provided
students with information on a
variety of issues concerning
animals, Krill said.

Q. What should I do if I am
arrested?

A. Remember, STAY CALM! I can’t
stress this enough. Even if you’re

However, if the police use
excessive force or any type of

informed.

Q. What happens when I am
arrested?

A. The police will take you to the
police station and “book” you.
You will be asked to fill out
forms and they will take your
fingerprints and possibly a

Steelers charge Rams;
corral. 41-10 drubbing

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

The Pittsburgh Steelers have
waited four years to make an
appearance on ABC’s Monday
Night Football. And from the way
last night’s contest against the
L.A. Rams began, it looked like
they might have waited nearly
another half decade to play in
front of Frank, Al and Dan.

Such will probably not be the
case, as the Steelers went on to a
41-10 shellacking of the Rams in
front of 56,466 at Three Rivers
Stadium.

“What pleased me most was
our defense keeping an offense
like this off the scoreboard. No
touchdowns. They were able to
turn around and give our offense
all the opportunity they needed,”
Steeler head coach Chuck Noll
said.

= “But we have to continue to
win, put a few together. We win
one, lose one, look like hell and
come back and play like champs.
We’ve got to put a string of playing
like champs together,” Noll
added.

Things did look dismal at the
start for the black and gold,
however.

Taking a mere 16 seconds off
the clock, Gaston Green blew
through Steeler special teams on

the opening kickoff for a 100-
yard touchdown, the first TD of
his career.

But the Steelers came right
back on the ensuing possession,
with Bubby Brister engineering
an 8-play, 75-yard textbook
drive. Brister hit Merril Hoge
with a 6—yard TD strike, going a
perfect 5 for 5 for 61 yards in the
process.

Late in the first quarter, Rams
QBJim Everett went to the well
one too many times. Everett had
been trying to exploit Steeler
cornerback David Johnson’s
coverage of Henry Ellard early.
But Johnson came up big,
picking Everett off and returning
the ball to the L.A. 17.

Brister hit tight end Eric Green
on the next play for a 17-yard
score to put the Steelers up 14-
7.

L.A. kicker Mike Lansford
added a 32-yard field goal in the
second quarter, while Gary
Anderson countered with his
own 42-yard boot to send
Pittsburgh into the locker room
with a 17-10 lead.

The third quarter was quiet
until Steeler special teams
thwarted a Keith English punt
with its 10—man rush. English
never got the ball away, as black

Pitt volleyball imports Canadian connection

By Linda Holley
Staff Writer

Recruiting athletes from
around the country is a routine
practice for large, competitive
universities.

Recruiting from Canada is now
becoming routine for Lady
Panther volleyball. The team
now boasts four key players, all
from Ontario.

Michele Adamson, Heather
Hollands, Dee MacAuley and
Ann Marie Lucanie make up the
Canadian connection.

Adamson is cu rrently a senior
co-captain with Jenelle
Lantagne. Adamson, along with
Hollands and MacAuley, was
recruited by former head coach
Shelton Collier. Collier served
his term until the winter'of1988.
Present head coach Sue
Woodstra recruited Lucanie.

Sports are not taken as
seriously in Canada as they are
in America, explained
MacAuley. “But we have a lot of
athletes, and they’re anxious to
come here and get help paying
on an education,” Adamson
added. Canada does not offer
athletic scholarships.

Hollands, who came from
Midland Avenue High School,
had not even heard of Pittsbu rgh
before Collier approached her.
“The only thing I heard of was
Terry Bradshaw,” she said with
a chuckle. “I just got on a plane,
and I landed."

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Tuesday, October 30, 1990

‘, Socleers prove that

dynasties can exist

When one looks in the soccer dictionary for the meaning of
the word “dynasty,” four words appear: The San Diego
Sockers. They have won eight indoor championships in nine
years, including last year. But last year was different. The
Sockers struggled to a mediocre‘ 25-27 record (including a
dismal 6-20 record on the road) but squeaked through the
playoffs and rose to the occasion in the championship games.

The Sockers now feature a more balanced attack, including
the best goalie tandem in the Major Soccer League (Victor
Nogueira and Zoltan Toth), reliable Kevin Crow on defense,
workhorse Brian Quinn at halfback and erratic Branko Segota
up front. Lack of depth may hurt the Sockers; on paper this is
the weakest Socker team ever. Look for the Sockers to finish
second. 9

The Dallas Sidekicks live and die on the feet of Tatu, who
threw his shirt into the crowd with each of his league—leading
64 goals. His supporting
cast of no-names play a
gritty, inspired brand of
soccer — at least enough
to produce wins.
Goalkeeper Joe Papaleo
(first in the league with a
3.34 goals-against average) and workhorse Doc Lawson anchor
a tough defense. T atu must stay healthy for the ’Kicks to
challenge for the top spot in the Western division. Without him,
Dallas is barely a .500 team.

Soccer is no stranger to St. Louis; the Steamers were once the
MSL’s most successful franchise before drowning in a sea of red
ink in 1988. The St. Louis Storm brought soccer back to the
city, posting a respectable 24-28 record in its first season.

The Storm made big waves in the off—season by signing
former MSL Most Valuable Player Preki, who was third in the

Gaither

, league in scoring last year. This bold move gives St. Louis one

thing which was missing from last year—— a proven goal scorer.
This team will improve on last year’s third-place finish, and if
Preki can stay hot, it may win the division.

The Tacoma Stars could be in for a long season. One must
question the team’s motives when this last-place team failed to

re-sign its leading scorer, and” most recognizable player, Preki-  —

This loss leaves a gaping hole on goal scoring, placing the
burden on the hot-and-cold Kia and former Chicago Sting great
Pato Margetic. . ’ '

The highly touted midﬁeld failed to live up to expectations.

i Ricky Davis contributed a measly seven points, andAli Kazemaini

only had 23. The return of “Elegant Assassin" Neil Megson, who
only played 10 games due to injury last year, is the lone bright
spot. Goalkeeping is in thexhands of capable Cris Vaccaro, but
he can’t do it all alone. Don’t expect more than 25 wins from
these fallen Stars. 0

“We played really well. We
always seem to play well in the
big games,” said senior Roberto
Croce. “Tim played pretty well;
he started out a little shaky but
grew more confident as the game
wore on.”

As for the Panther season, the
team recovered from a disastrous
mid-season road trip to raise its
record to 6-8-2, with one game

MacAuley came from Victoria Park High School
the same year as Hollands. Both players knew
Adamson from playing together on the Ontario
Provincial Team.

“I don’t think I would have made it if I hadn’t
known Michele,” Hollands added. They all agreed
it was an exciting adventure, but it was scary too.

MacAuley did not want to come to the States at
the time of her recruitment.

She was one of thetop 12 players in Ontario and

preseason poll.

v was on the club team that won the national

championship in 1987. She could have gone
anywhere.

Hollands had planned to attend Calgary or Ontario,
but since Collier approached her personally, she
gave in to the idea and came to America. “I have no
regrets,” she quickly added. '

Lucanie, a freshman, was the most recent recmitee.
Also from Victoria Park, she knew MacAuley and
Hollands from high school and from club and
provincial teams.

Lucanie took two years off after high school to
play volleyball. “Last yearl decided that my education
should be a priority over volleyball, so I came to
Pitt."

Upon graduating from Pitt,’ all four members of
the Canadian quad intend to return home.

“That's where my heart is," said Hollands.

MacAuley misses friends and family, not to
mention that she prefers Toronto to Pittsburgh. “We
have a lot less rain,” she said with a smile. Lucanie

four playoff teams and tying for

five goals and two assists for 12
points. Second on the team in
scoring is senior Nick Liberati
who has four goals and two assists
for 10 points. Sobelman’s overall
record is 3-2-1, while Pitt’s other

goaltender, Jay Kapusta, is 3-6-1.

plans to pick up play on the Canadian national
team. I

Adamson is ready to go north and get away from
the hype of being labeled “different.”

“Americans and Canadians are pretty much the
same,” Hollands defended. “If you saw them in a
crowd, you couldn’t tell who was from where. I
look like everyone else."

The Canadians fit in well with the team. They
only fear being played up by the media too much.

Lantagne came to their defense, saying, “Yes,
they're unique, being from Canada, but hardly
anyone on the team is from Pennsylvania, so
they're not really different.” She is from San Diego,
Calif. '

“We all mesh together, and that makes it fun,”
Lantagne said. Adamson claimed that she has never
played on a team that is so close. “We just don’t go
to practice, then leave,” MacAuley added.

The clan gives Coach Woodstra credit for keeping
the team together. “She's great to go to as a friend
and as a coach,” Lucanie said.

Hollands praised Woodstra’s style in comparison
to Col1ier’s. “[Woodstral gives everyone the
opportunity to play.” Adamson added, “Coach

Woodstra treats us the same, so the respect carries

over."

Woodstra said she will continue to recruit from
Canada. “[Canada]‘ produces really strong players.
They react the same and play the same as Americans,
but the competition isn’t as steep when it comes to
recruiting,” she addedat»
