.Up Tempo Jazz

, "' For PM Crowd

- 3*.‘-v‘"

By NANCY DELANEY
,. Heat. And cigarette smoke.
And muggineshs. And over 200
students drumming in rhythm

to — “no name, just jazz on .

the modern side,” as Jerry
Betters himself described his
quartet’s improvisions at last
Thursday’s P.M. Series.

The amount of applause for

the quartet of drums, tenor sax-

" aphone, piano, and bass ﬁ_ddle
testiﬁed that the jazz enthusiasts
in the dimly-‘lit, lower lounge of
the Student Union approved the
upbeat presentation “on the mod-
ern“ side.”

, The group deﬁnitely“ good ,‘to-_

’ gether. The piano player, strong
in his lead," held an up-tempo
_most of the evening; and the sax
player, although often issuing
dry tones, had striking technique.
The ability of the bass player
was particularly evident when he
carried hints of the melody.

Peculiar Style Pattern

Scuffed baby shoes, a good
luck charm, hung from the bass
_drum, as early in the evening
the group departed from its pecu-
liar style pattern of four bars to-
gether and four bars of Betters
on_the drums for a ﬁfteen minute
drum solo, called “Caravan.”
Foot-tapping stopped long‘ be-
fore the solo did, however,
bringing to mind that “few.
sinners are saved after the ﬁrst
ﬁfteen minutes of a sermon;”
but the raucous applause as
four bars of the original rhy-
thm pattern brought back the
rest of the group‘ indicated
that the congregation had get-
ten the message anyway.

The latter half of the program
included a review of jazz from
its beginnings, complete with ex-
planations. Trombonist, Skip Nel-
son, who joined the group after
the intermission, slipped hints of
Dixie and waltz-time into his
slow blues; ‘but his performance
was neither as potent nor as pie-
torial as that of the others.

Versatile Pianist

The pianist had previously
sketched with his high keys the
.scene of children actually play-

- ing “On the Street Where You
Live,” by intimating the tune in
which little boys teasingly sing
“Johnny has a girl-friend.”

Gremlins, brought in by tra-
ces of the melody of “The Hall
of the Mountain King,” over-
shadowed the smiles of “The
Man I Love” and forewarned
possible heartbreak. “The Man
I Love’ was given additional
unique effects by featuring the
bass as lead.

During the intermission, the
silver-haired social director of
the Student Union graciously
served refreshments from silver
punch bowls on a long buffet ta-
ble, complete with white table-
cloth and summery bouquet. But
when the quartet stepped. back
onto the platform, students again
propped their bare feet on- the
coffee tables and ﬂicked cigarette
ashes on the ﬂoor: a smoke haze

Battle Over Reapportionment Slays

, Seven Million Dollar Appropriation
’ In an attempt to force a reluctant Republican controlled. -
state legislature to resolve the long standing political battle '

over the reapportioning of voting districts in the state, House
Democratslast week refused to approve close to 90-million
dollars Worth of appropriation bills.

“One of thebills blocked by the Democrats would.
the University with $4,795,265 forO

general maintenance, and an ad-
ditional $2,130,058 for the opera-
tion of Western Psychiatric In-
stitute. .

Calling the move a common po-
litical trick, Russell R. Jalbert,
director of the University’s pub-
lic relations department, admitted
that it as a “severe blow not only
to the University but to all other
institutions which receive aid from
the state.”

Quite A Hole '

Lawrence L. Monnett, assistant.

chancellor in charge of business

affairs, stated that if the money

is not forthcoming the University

would be placed in “quite a hole.”

“We simply can’t operate,”

he continued. “without this
money. from the state.”

House GOP leader Albert WL
Johnson warned that his party is
placing the blame for any insti-
tutional hardship -which may re-
sult from the action directly on
the ‘Democrats.

It is hoped by the Democrats
that this will force the Repub-
licans to bring the issue of re-
apportionment up for debate be-
fore the current session of the
legislature adjourns on July 31,
but, according to Johnson, the
Republicans will proceed to ad-
journ in spite of the protest
block.

The situation, concluded Jal-
bert, “will resolve itself in the
end, but at this time there is noth-
ing which we can do about it.”

Conservative Myth . . .

campus Re\,o|E_|| LETTERS To THE EDITOR

By Thomas Plate

Warnings to everyone on the political left of General
Eisenhower (inclusive)! Fill those canteens, clean those
muskets. head for the hills, the Conservatives are marching!
For too long have those Liberals run the Establishment.
For too long have they appeased (allegedly)
the Communists. For too long have they

are more than a few college students interested in express-
ing publically political‘ views.

Now, according to the best information available, this
Uiriiversity is a major university in America. There are
many students at this Ulniversity. Thus. if all the premises
are correct,, there are more than a few students here pub-
lically interested in politics.

This is obviously false. The Society for C.onservat.ive
Studies here has ten members. This is .16‘”;% of the enrolled
undergraduates. Every once in a while. attendance jumps
to .32%. During the Fall and Winter trimesters, the Pitt
Political Forum drew only a handful of old standbys.

Revolt ls Myth
In short, the Conservative revolt on campus is a myth.

Journalists who allege that there is a collegiate, Conserva-
tive revolt are guilty of the most extreme form of induc-
tion ever attempted. Some might call their induction
distortion.

Editor, The Pitt News: ,
Your issue of June 26 printed
an article concerning my resig-
nation from the-University ad-
ministration. The tone and infer-

ences of the article imply that
I have been subject to pressures

    

from the Offce of the Dean of
Students. The article also infers-
that the entire interview center.
ed upon a discussion of my dis.
satisfaction with the University
administration. I ask that this
letter be printed to set the record
straight.

I was asked about the nature

from: both the Dean of Students .

and Dr. 'C_ra,fts, -my immediate

them has beenanything but un‘‘-?

Intramural ldiocy

The intramural softball playoffs has a very intriguing;
feature to them. It seems that after playing most of the
summerto determine a winner‘ of the league, it has been
decided to ﬂip a coin to pick a champion.

The reason given for this is that the. three teams in-
volved — the Mets, Chem Engineers and Circle K —— do not.
want to have to play another game. « '

This seems slightly illogical. Why not ﬂip a coin in the
beginning of the season and forget about”pl_a-ying? We al-
.,_ways thought the purpose of intramural athletics was to give
._students a chance_ to participate _in sports.‘ ‘As far as we know,
coin-ﬂipping is not yet classiﬁed as -a sport. A

The entire idea of the playoffs seems like a poor one.
Whygnot let the, winners of‘each;le‘ague playcbest-of-three-
series. to determine ‘the school champ? There is lnoineed to
in'v.olve- the "second place 'teams_,'~which have lost as many as
two games."  -'

‘ The ‘MBA,. champions of the National League, did
not lose‘ _a game this season. It seems unfair to them, to
give a second place team which they may-haveibeaten

Thus after. performing so well during the regular .sea-

The team is stocked with six lettermen at end, two at

Thalmzin’s job is, _of ‘course, to sell tickets for the game

Defense Key
To Successful  
Soccer Team

With_the soccer season still
two months away, coach Leo

‘Bemis remains uncertain of

his team’s chances this fall.
“We’ll have a good season,”
said Bemis, “if we can win
the halfback battles at mid-ﬁeld,”
Co-captain Andy McGraw echoed
the same sentiments.

A large, number of freshmen
are moving up to the varsity this
year. Center-half McGraw.is the
returning defensive mainstay on
the varsity. Two other goalies are
expected to give co—captain Tom
Staab stiff competition for his po-

sition. Staab, McGraw_, and line-

man Bruno-Schwiarz have all been
named co—captains for this fall. -

Bemis expects the front line
to provide power shooting and
dazzling ball control. The half-
backs and defense .wil be ques-
tion marks until the season be-
gins.

Bemis lostboth starting full-
backs and a starting halfback
through graduation, as well as an-
other halfback and a. promising
fullback through scholastic diffi-
culties. --

Maryland and West‘ Chester will

New School.Mark'
Set in 220-Yd. Dash
By Bill DelVecchio

Track star Bill DelVecchio con- —

tinues to turn in record breaking
times. The. sophomore sprinter
came within two-tenths of a sec-
ond of a world’s record recently
when he ran a 220-yard dash in
20.2 seconds on a straight-away.
The time was the best ever turned
in by a Pitt runner.

Last Saturday DelVecchio turn-S

ed in a 9.5 seconds time in_ the
Eastern AAU championships at
Baltimore. The -time came during
one of the trials. DelVecchio failed
to place in the ﬁnals, although
coach Carl Rees said that many
observers felt DelVecchio actually
won the race but was missed by
the judges.

“We usually have

‘promising’ freshmen, according to
Kaliden. “Kaiser is a strong line-
backer, and he’s big (6-feet-2, 220-
pounds). That's why we like him.”

Three Good Quarterback

The Cubs also have three strong
quarterback candidates. Ed James,
from New Castle, is reportedly the
top passer among‘ the incoming

_ freshmen, according ,to. Kaliden.

Pete Smith, Uniontown’s signal
caller last year,-and a member of
the “Bigf33” football squad, runs
with good speed and ‘agility. The
third quarterback, another good
passer, is Joe Pohl, from‘Erie.

Combined with the freshman
team’s passing attack will be
strong running, led by Jim
Flanigan, all-s t a t e fullback
from West Mifflin North. “He’s
a ‘bull-type runner,” Kaliden
said. “We’re going to have to do
some work with him to make
him more agile.”

‘The light end crop disappointed
Kaliden. “We were counting on
Uniontown’s Ron Sepic, but he
isn’t coming here now. That leaves
us with only two ends. Mike Ros-
borough, from Donora, and Kurt
Wentzel, from Mount Lebanon.

No Varsity Scrimmages

Unlike last year, the freshmen
will not scrimmage with the var-
sity.’ “Last year, the varsity was
short-handed, so we had to help
them out.”

“This yea r, though, we‘don’t
have enough football players for

will come out.for the team on
"their own.’?

Kaliden added that because‘ of
the lack of players, some members
of the squad would have to be
converted to different positions,
especially end.
