Pitt Faculty Groups 

To Vote on Merger  

By SETH LUBOVE

Just mention the word “merger"
these days to a Wall Street broker.
and you'll probably hear two com-
panies: Conoco and Marathon Oil
Company.

How about this one: the Pitt Pro-
fessional Union (PPU) and the
American Association of University
Professors (AAUP)?

Well. it may not grace the
exchanges of Wall Street. sending
brokers into a trading frenzy. but
discussion of a merger between the
PPU and Pitt’s chapter of the
AAUP will be gracing the halls of
the Cathedral of Learning for the
next two weeks as the two member-
ships vote'on a proposed merger.

Ballots are due Dec. 4.

If a majority of the two member-
ships agrees withthe merger, a new
group called the United Faculty
(UF) will be formed and will include
all of the PPU‘s current members
and' members of the AAUP’s Pro-
vost‘s Area bargaining unit.

(The Provost’s Area. according to
a ruling by the Pennsylvania Labor
Board in I976, includes full-time
faculty in the College of Arts and
Sciences, the schools of business,
education, engineering. library and
information science and social
work. the Graduate School of Pub-
lie and International Affairs. Falk
School. the University Center for
External Programs (UCEP). and
faculty librarians.)

Once the merger proposal ’ is

accepted, however. the new group
must then start a new campaign to
represent the faculty as a collective
bargaining agent,similartothe cam-
paign currently being waged by the

«PPU.

P A decision to go ahead with the

merger would most likely end they

PPU on Pitt’s campus. while the
AAUP would still exist, but only for
members outside of the Provost’s
Area.

“At some point. the PPU would
simply dissolve into the United
Faculty." said Philip Wion. presi-
dent ofthe PPU.

Before that time, a “joint interim
collective bargaining campaign
steering committee” would be
formed with representation from
both groups to conduct the authori-
zation card campaign for the United
Faculty. '

A “joint constitutional commit-
tee“ would also be formed to work
out a draft constitution for the Uni-
ted Faculty. That constitution
would contain a commitment to
support many ofthe principles con-
tained in the AAUP’s Po/icy Docu-
ments and‘Reporrs. also known as
the AAUP Redbook.

Richard Thorn. president ofPitt’s
AAUP chapter. said the merger
would probably be “theistrongest
option" that Pitt faculty could have
in collective bargaining.

All members of -the ' United
Faculty will also become members

of the state and national American '

Sir Angus Wilson sat cross-

Cathedral of Learning window
filled with early altiernoon sun-
light. His long white hair was
combed back lrom his 08 year-
old-~fa-ce. his eyes the color ol‘
eornfield—b|ue (‘rayolas
gleamed as he spoke in a heavy
English accent.

“I've been absolutely‘
enchanted with Pittsburgh,“ he
said. “It has the most lovely scen-
ery. some extremely good build-
ings. and some things that look
to be Blake's satanic mills. Apart
from the pavements. I really love
it.“

Wilson. English writer. critic.

teacher. is one of seven visiting
Mellon professors here at the
University this term. His works

All-illlt/(‘S and recently. Selling

''I started to write late. very
late indeed. (He was 33.) I‘d
never written anything. literally.
I didn‘t intend to write at all. It
was just a hobby.” he said.

“I lived off in the country and
just one November Sunday. I sat
down and wrote this story. It was
a rather sinister. macabre story
and I remember well because the
old lady who was my landlady
came in when I had finished
about 4 o'clock. I had started
about ll) o‘elock.

“I n she came and she said. ‘Oh.
l.ord. Mr. Wilson what ever are
you sitting in doors on a lovely
day like this for?‘

“ “I‘ve written a story.‘ I said.

“ ‘(). _vou‘re much better being
out of doors.‘ she said."

Such is a good start fora wri-
ter. Wilson said. because it
teaches him what to expect.
Relations and friends find it very
odd when one begins to write.

A graduate of Merton College.
Oxford. Wilson~said he spent a
good deal of the l93()s attending
parties. working as an amateur
actor and taking part in anti-
Ilitlcr protests.

“I think acting when you‘re
over 30 is not the thing to do and
I began to sa_v to myself. ‘Watch
out dearie. this is not the thing to
do when you're over 30.‘ " he said
with a laugh.

During the Second World
War. Wilson left his job as cata-
loguer at the British Museum
Library and served the war effort
as a naval decoder. He was also
involved in the evacuation of val-
uable museum goods to safe
places.

Upon returning to the library

after the war. Wilson was
responsible for trying to restore
some 3()t).tl()() volumes destroyed
in the bombings. He succeeded in
restoring about ll)().()I)l) oftltem.
It was at this job in the
library's Reading Room. Wilson
said. that he met some eccentric
scholars on whom he based some
of his more exotic characters.
Wilson calls himself a "great
traveler" and has visited all but
five of the states. “There are
areas I absolutely love. It's a con-
tinent. so how can you say (you

like) one more than the other‘."’
However. he added that one of

his favorite places is I.os
Angeles. ‘

“I loved it when I first went
there and wanted to get away
from Europe. I met quite intelli-
gent people who had never been
to Europe and didn‘t want to go
there. and I thought this was
marvelous. Ihey had been to

Australia and Japan and weren’t
interested in Europe."

Wilson said he enjoys writing
out of doors in hot places. He has
traveled to Morocco. the South
Sahara and (‘eylon to do just
that.

Despite his extensive travels.
Wilson still maintains strong
British ties. Referring to his
knighthood. Wilson said. "there
are not many literary knights
about three. I think. I'm not
going to sa_v I’m the best. I’m one
of the best of five or six English

novelists. certainly within one of

the first eight. to throw a figure
around."

But his knighthood. he says.
comes mainly from the large
amount of volunteer work he has

done for writers in Britian as
Chairman of the Arts Council.
For instance. he says. “We got a
law passed through now that wri-

ters will get some percentage of

money every time their book is
borrowed from a library."

After finishing up his two

classes here at Pitt (a graduate

course in creative writing and a
course on children in adult litera-
ture). he will be heading after.a
brief stop in |.ondon to Portugal
for a three or four week vacation
to work on an anthology of East
Anglian literature.

Wilson also hopes to write his
autobiography one day. but said
he fears that "half ofwhat I shall
write will be family legend."

Phi Eta Sigma
Offers Tutoring

By MICHAEL FRESHWATER

If you don‘t understand what‘s
going on in your calculus class. or if
gas laws are getting you down, don't
panic. Phi Eta Sigma may be able to
help you.

Phi Eta Sigma is a national fresh-
man scholastic honor society. and
Pitt‘s chapter of Phi Eta Sigma
offers a free, campus—wide tutoring
service. Members of the organiza-
tion assist 200 to 300 undergraduate
students per term with their studies,
according to Clare Watt. president
of the society.

Watt said the tutoring program
offers help in a variety of subjects
and classes. Most students who ask
for assistance want help in mathe-
matics and the natural sciences. but
the program is not limited to those
fields.

“We try to meet the tutoring needs
of as many students as possible,"she
explained.

The tutoring program -is com-

PPU

Federation of Teachers. the labor
organization that is a part of the
AFL-CIO.

Thorn said the idea for a merger

pletely organized and manned by
Phi Eta Sigma’s members.

“The program is completely free.
and the tutors work on a volunteeer
basis," Watt said.

Phi Eta Sigma was formerly
located on the student union‘s third
floor. but the organization was
moved to the union‘s recreation
room earlier this year because of
building renovations.

“Our tutoring program has suf-
fered because students are having
difficulty getting in touch with us
since our location changed.“ Watt
said.

Tutoring sessions can be arranged
by phoning the organization at 624-
5837 or by stopping at its office and
filling out an information card. The
sessions are scheduled by appoint-
ment only.

“If you think you‘rc going to need
tutoring. it is important to go as

soon as possible. Don't wait until it‘s .

time for finals.” Watt advised.
Members of Phi Eta Sigma are

between the AAUP and the PPU
surfaced about a year ago when the
PPU approached the AAUP with
the suggestion. Then in October. a
straw vote of the AAUP’s members
was taken, the results ofwhich were
pretty much split as far as havingthe

Any student who has a 3.5 quality

term is eligible for membership.

Watt noted that less than 0 per?‘

cent of freshmen nationwide meet
the eligibility requirement.

Phi Eta Sigma‘s membership on
campus is 600. Each year 2()() new
members are inducted to replace
those who graduate. and member-
ship is lifelong.

In addition to promotion of the

Thorn said that four Options were
listed: to take no position. to oppos
the union. to have the AAUP as the
sole bargaining agent. and to merge

with the PPU in a common
organization.
The two non—union options

received 50 percent of the vote.
Thorn said. while having the AAIJ P
as the sole bargaining agent received
20 percent and the merger option
received 30 percent of the vote.
“We‘re (the AAUP) a more con-

Opinion

The Pit! Neiiw. Momlay. November 23, I98!

    Catching
Bandﬂs

There’s another commuter bandit at Pitt,
besidesthe helpful one sponsored by the
Commuter Affairs Committee.

According to one suburban lawmaker, it’s
none other than Pittsburgh’s newly re-elected
mayor Richard Caliguiri.

Caliguiri, already suspect because of such
adept political maneuvers as raising taxes
shortly after being elected, is now proposing
to tax commuters who live outside the city
but work in it. ,

What this means for the University of
Pittsburgh is this: Pitt is the city’s largest
employer, and its employees, no doubt, are
going to shell out some extra dollars for the
privilege of driving to Oakland, where, if
they’re lucky, they can find a parking place.

The reasoning behind the tax is that city

residents and businesses are already over— I

taxed. Caliguiri believes the city should turn
to its suburban commuters, who, he says,
benefit from city privileges and services, such
as police protection and emergency medical
services, without paying for them.

“The tax base of our cities must be broa-
dened so that all ofthose who receive munici-
pal services pay their fair share," Caliguiri
said. _

Its true that the city, which is facing a $49
million budget deficit for next year, should
attempt to relieve its fiscal crisis before its
problems become as severe as those of

g Detroit or Cleveland.

But suburban commuters are the wrong
place to look to for help.

While the suburbanites may be generally
sympathetic to the city’s plight, it’s also worth
noting that although suburban commuters
take advantage of city services, they also pro-
vide city revenue in the form of patronizing
city restaurants, theaters and sporting events.

While the proposed tax would be only 0.25
percent this year, it will undoubtedly rise and
suburban commuters will find“ themselves
paying a high price for working in the city.

Some suburban lawmakers have suggested
that the city raise occupational privilege
taxes as an alternative to the commuter tax.
But if a suburban commuter tax is ever
enacted, we hope that it will come only after
all alternative funding proposals have been
proven unworkable. ‘ »

Otherwise, working at Pitt or anywhere
else in the city will become even more expen-
sive for commuters, in terms ofparking, trav-
eling, and paying taxes.

Glewz Undergradsl Pay ForMed School

Dear Editor:

Quietly and almost without
notice. Dr. Posvar has effectively
transformed Pitt‘s School of Medi-
cine from a taxpayer-supported
institution for all the people into a
state-supported one for the rich.
Under his aegis, this past year we
experienced an unprecedented 32
percent increase in tuition for state
residents. bringing the total tuition
fee to just under $9.000. I

In recent months. university
administrators, rubber-stamp
members of the Board of Trustees

‘and highly paid (with taxpayers dol-

lars) lobbyists have mounted a

vigorous public relations campaign .

to convince us all that theblame for
the tuition debacle lies with recalci-
trant. anti-university lawmakers in
Harrisburg. The media blitz. is
designed to deflect critical attention
away from the university in general
and the School of Medicine specifi-
cally. But the roots of the problem
do not originate in the state capitol;
they run deepthrough the very foun-
dations of the School of Medicine
and the University Health Center.
As a first step in bringing the deplor-
able consequences of Dr. Posvar’s
imperial reign to halt, we must
understand that the chancellor and
Dean I.con are in the process ofset-
ting up the state legislators to be the
“fall guys“ when the next enormous
round of tuition
announced early in I982.

A major cause ofthe tuition disas-
ters in the School of Medicine may
very well be the collection of I4
assorted practice plans and private
corporations that have been created

.since I976 (the time when tuition

costs began to soar!) by the unac-
countable chairpersons of the clini-
cal departments. In I980-8l, the
secret corporations earned more
than $l8 million. a truly enormous
sum when one considers that the
total ofall revenues in the School of
Medicine in the same fiscal year
amounted to $l9 million.
Furthermore, by Dr. Leon‘s own
admission, practice plans based in
the University Health Center are
expected to generatemore money
next year than is contained in the
entire medical school budget! In
acknowledging this expectation. I

’ am reminded of Dr. Posvar’s recent

exhortation to the Dean: “For heav-
en‘s sake, Don. you‘ve got to get
those practice plans ‘under control;
this is the last time the School of
Medicine will be bailed out with $3
million from undergraduate tui-
tion." (I wonder how graduate stu-
dents and faculty members in the
department of geography felt when
they realized that Wesley Posvar

increases is A

literally gave $6 million from under-

graduate tuition at Pitt to the School

of Medicine in I980 and l98l to

'keep it afloat. while for want of

$l00.0()0 the geographers were being
discarded!)

It is worth exploring the medical
school budget a little more closely. A
report prepared two months ago by
Dean Leon for Governor Thorn-
burgh indicated that in I976 tuition
fees accounted for $l.2 million (I0
percent) of the $l2.| million of the
School of Medicine. That same year
$2.2 million came to the Dean's
office from the hospitals of the
Health Center from payments to
clinical faculty for services rendered
during the course of teaching.

By I98! the revenues of the
School of Medicine amounted to
$lti.8 million. with $5.2 million
(more than 30 percent!) being
derived from student tuitions. And
what about revenues from services
rendered to hospitals of the Health
Center by clinical faculty in l98l‘.’
The answer $2.2 million: essen-
tially the same contribution to the
budget that clinical service activities
were generating in I976, before the
advent ofthe highly secret and lucra-
tive clinical practice plans.

Where have the millions ofdollars
in practice—plan revenues gone over
the past five years during which time

students at this state-related mcdical_

school have assumed the burden of
providing nearly one-third of the
budget revenues‘? Other than the
greedy guardians of the practice
plans. no one knows. The truth will
become apparent to us only as the
result of intervention by the state in,
the form of a comprehensive and
independent audit ofall the practice
plans.

A crisis may be required in the
School of Medicine to bring the
practice plans_into the sunshine.
State legislators can precipitate this
crisis by withholding funds from the
university. By so doing they can
bring the School of Medicine to a
grinding halt, thereby forcing
accountability on the practice plan
chairman and full disclosure of the
contents and disposition of the
plans. Some form of external over-
sight of practice plans that would
protect the interests ofthe citizens of
Pennsylvania should be a prerequi-
site to any significant increase in
financial support to the University
of Pittsburgh. It is ironic that Dr.
Posvar’s finance officer, Dr. Free-
man. devotes‘ his precious time to
analy7ing the benefits to be derived
from joining this or that athletic
conference while tens of the millions
of dollars of potential revenues flow
under his nose in the School of

Medicine. f

No first-rate institution in Amer-
ica has a dean who serves both as
medical school dean and health cen-
ter president. But examples of
conflicts-of-interest abound in Oak-
land. For example, the chairman of
the board of the Health Center is
also the chairman ofthe Health Sys-
tems Agency. the body that reviews
and approves new hospital construc-
tion. Conflicts-of-interest are widely
accepted at the highest levels in Oak-
land. The prevailing attitude seems
to be that it is sufficient only to
iicknowledge the existence of
conflict-of-interest situations. This
is not good enough: it is not suffi-
cient to recognige conflict-of-
interest. it'mu.st be eliminated.

In considering the way ‘resources-
are being squandered in the School‘
of Medicine and the welfare of our
citizens is ignored. I close with a
reflection of the African writer Chi-
nua Achebe: “My concern is with the
absence ofa countervailingtradition
of enlightened criticism_ and dis-
sent." If we lack the courage to iden-
tify and acknowledge our problems.
how can we ever begin to solve
them‘? Let us begin with a thorough
audit of the School of Medicine.

Evaluation
Comment . t

Dear Editor?

Concerning the article written in
the Forum column on “Mandatory
Teaching Evaluations". in the Nov.
20th edition of The Pit! News‘, I
would like to correct some of the
statements regarding the policies of
the Office for the ‘Evaluation of
Teaching. What the article does not
explain is that policies for requesting
surveys vary from one school to
another. In the college of Arts and
Sciences. as well as in some other
schools. surveys must be requested
by individual faculty members
under most circumstances.

However in some schools faculty
members have voted to establish a
policy that requires all faculty to
have evaluations periodically. At the
present time. surveys are required in
the schools of Buisness, GSPIA.
Social Work and some special pro-
grams. I would like to make clear
that a policy of requiring faculty to
have periodic surveys of their teach-
ing is the result of a particular
administrator and/or faculty action,
not that ofthe Office forthc Evalua-
tion of Teaching.

SugarBow| Bound Pitt WaI|opsTemp|e

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

PHlLADELPHlA——The No. l
Pitt Panthers won not only the foot-
ball game Saturday against the Tem-

A ple Owls. but also the chance to keep

theirigrasp onall that the ‘collegiate
game can offer a team-—the national
championship.

After a sloppy but convincing 35-
0 victory over Temple (5-4) beforea
crowd of\32.570 at Veteran's Sta-
dium. the Panthers (l0-0) were
offered and accepted a bid to play in
the Sugar Bowl against the No. 3
Georgia Bulldogs. in the game that
will probably decide the national
championship.

The I980 star—studded‘ Pitt team
did not have such a chance. and that
is a fact Jackie Sherrill did not forget
in the bedlam and joy of the Pitt
locker room after accepting the
Sugar Bowl’s invite as players

hugged. yelled and lit up some vic-

tory cigars.

“We've worked awful hard for it.
and we deserve it. It's been
coming...we were kind of left (feel-
ing upset) the last two years...at the
Sugar Bowl." Sherrill said. “I'm

Lady Spikers Win
Eastern Crown

The Pitt Lady Panthers romped
to the Eastern Association of Inter-
collegiate Athletics for Women Di-
vision I Eastern Regional Volleyball
Championships last weekend.
recording an impressive string of
victories over some ofthe top teams
in eastern volleyball. The tourna-
ment victory reserved a place for the
Lady Panthers in the Association of
lntercollegiate Athletics for Women
Division I National Championships
which will be held Dec. 9-l2 at Flor-
ida Staic._

Pitt. whose match record now
stands at 36-l3. went undefeated in
six" matches. The rampage began in
round-robin play with Pitt defeating

three strong teams-George
Washington. Temple and
Providence.

The George Washington match
started slowly. with Pitt losing the
first game l5-9. However. the Lady
Panthers rebounded and swept the
last two games and the match I5-9
and l5-2. Temple and Providence
proved to be easy conquests. with

the Lady Panthers defeating Temple 5

l5-4 and I6-I4. and Providence l5-3
and l5-l0.

These victories placed Pitt in the
quarter finals. where it soundly
defeated Princeton l5-6 and'|5-9.

When the semifinals rolled
around. only Pitt. Rutgers. George
Washington and Maryland
remained alive in the tournament.

Pitt defeated Maryland with sur-
prising ease. l5-4. l5-8 and l5-l0.
This victory. coupled with Rutgers’
loss to George Washington. set the
stage for Saturday afternoon's
championship game in which an
emotionally high Pitt team quickly

extinguished George Washington‘s
fire.

When the smoke cleared. the
Lady Panthers were Eastern cham-
pions. crushing George Washington
l5-9. l5-2 and l5-4. Senior captain
Paula Olsen appropriately ended the
tournament with a powerful spike
that sent the sparse crowd to its feet.

Pitt Coach Shelton Collier was
extremely pleased with his team’s
showing. L

“This is a classic example of a
teams peaking at the right time. We
held back and waited all year. We
were hungry for the championship
and simply would not be denied. The
team picked a great time to put it all
together." Collier said. “We were
mentally prepared for the tourna-
ment. We paced ourselves through
the round robin and when we hit the
playoffs we exploded andtruly dom-
inated the tournament.”

Collier. calling his team “a
coaches dream.“ praised the Lady
Panthers for theirvrmaturity. confi-
dence and execution.

~£‘We knew what it would take to
win the tournament and the team
did the job." Collier said.

When asked about his team's
dominance throughout the tourna-
ment. Collier said. “I was a little sur-
prised at winning the semifinals and
the finals as easily as we did. but this
is a tribute to how well we played.
Dominating the playoffs as we did
puts us in a great frame of mind
going into the nationals. l was
impressed with our desire and our
defense. Ordinarily we rely on power
to win. but we complemented our
powerful spiking with great

defense."

PHll.ADELPHlA- Like a bull

the Pitt Panther football team so
young. so inexperienced and so sur-
prisingly good has shattered a slew
of football axioms en route to a I0-0
season. No. I ranking and Saturday.
a Sugar Bowl bid.

Rarely has experience been so
devalued at the expense of enthusi-
asm. strength supplanted by heart.
and a head coach‘s opinions and
fears so happily contradicted so
much that the same coach is now the
front-runner for Coach of the Year
honors. his team the leading con-
tender for the national crown.

“Cinderella team this season"
according to head coach Jackie
Sherrill-v~ have exceeded the stand-

an onus than a spark to this year's

“They‘ve already made the deci-
sion." Sherrill said and smiled as the
cheers and index fingers started to

Diane Zack spiing the ball during the Lady Panthers volleyball win ove'r"l'iempei. H

Collier was also extremely pleased

with individual play. “Seniors Paula

Olsen and Linda Stadler really came
to play. They were dominant players

throughout the tourney and showed .

great inspiration and leadership."he
said.

Also of great importance to the
Pitt effort were two Pitt freshmen.
who stepped in to play prominent
roles during Pitt’s injury-riddled
season.

“I was very impressed with the
play of the two freshmen. Ulana
Kohutiak and Judy Young. Both
played like experienced veterans."

Diane Zack _and Julie Gaul also
played impressively. “Diane Zack
played her best tournament of the
season. Every aspect of her game

 

was excellent." Colliericontinued.

“Julie Gaul. who began setting a
little over a year ago. proved that she
has developed into one of the top
collegiate setters around. She
directed the offense with outstand-
ing setting and scored often with
unexpected offspeed shots to the
opponent's court."

One special story of the tourna-
ment. according to coach Collier.
was theiserving of Robin Kukalis.

“Robin has severely torn liga-
ments in her ankle. but I felt that her
serving was valuable enough to have

‘her limp on to the court only to serve

and have the team play defense with
only five players."

The strategy paid off remarkably
well. as Kukalis consistently served

Cronan photo

for strings of points throughout the
tournament. _

When asked about the all-
tournament team. the Pitt coach
labeled it “a joke."

“l‘m not sure what tournament
that the people who voted for the
all-tournament team watched. but it
wasn’t the one that we played in.
Only Paula Olsen made the team. l
was disappointed that we didn't
have several more players on the
team. as they deserved (it). and we
more than proved it.”

Collier was especially disap-
pointed that Linda Stadler and Julie
Gaul didn't make the team. saying
that these two. along with Olsen.
were “probably the top three players

_ in the tournament.“

Pitt Hoopsters Impressive  

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Things Roy Chipman learned on
Friday in Pitt's 88-69 exhibition
game win against the Australian
National Team:

0 Roosevelt Kirby, who scored I9
points and pulled down nine
rebounds, looks to be more than an
adequate replacement for Sam
Clancy.

0 its going to be tough for Chip-
man to keep guard Billy Culberston
out of the lineup.

0 Ditto for Andre Williams.

0 Steve Beatty played like a cen-
ter, making strong moves to the
basket. and shot four ofsix from the
field.

Though the good things appeared
to dominate Pitt‘s win against a tired
Australian team, Chipman realized
his team has a long way to go.

“We have to be more consistent
defensively and eliminate concentra-

The Pill .’Vew.s', (Mom/a_i'. Novwnber 23, 198/

tion mistakes,” Chipman lamented.

The concentration mistakes,
according to Chipman, are attribu-
table to youth and will hopefully dis-
appear in time.

What Chipman wants desperately
to remain is the way Beatty played.
The center, whom Chipman had
continually pointed to as the key
and, at the same time, the weak spot
of the team, has earned a little
reinforcement.

‘Beatty, going up against 7-foot
center Peter Walsh, drove to the

basket and put the ball on the floor. =

Maybe the most encouraging sign.
however, was his six rebounds. At
205 pounds. there was fear by Chip-
man that Beatty would get boxed
out under the boards.

Not only didn't Beatty get boxed
out, his backup Andre’ Williams was
even more effective under the
boards. The 6-8 freshman pulled
down nine rebounds and scored
eight points, in a four for five night

from the floor. That's I5 rebounds
and I7 points from the centerspot, a
statistic that heartened Chipman.

Chipman was also happy with the
play of the players he expects to
score points for him.

“I thought Roosevelt Kirby and
Clyde Vaughn played well. They
both shot the ball very well," Chip-
man said.

It was no secret that Vaughn, who
ended the game with l2 points,
could shoot but Roosevelt Kirby
made it official that he too could fill

it up. Along with l9 points, six of

which came on dunks, Kirby
snatched nine rebounds. Although
obviously pleased with his perfor-
mance, Kirby offered some self-
criticism.

“Although I went up strong and
played well on offense, I wasn‘t
happy with the way l played defense.
l have to concentrate more on

Lady Panthers Roll to Second Straight Win

By MARIE HUFF
The Pitt Lady Panther basketball
team soared to its second win ofthe

5‘ season Sunday afternoon, ﬂying

past the Lady Eagles of Niagara
University I00-bl. Pitt. which plans
to spend the Thanksgiving weekend
at Kansas State University partici-
pating in the Converse Little Apple
Classic, now sports a spotless 2-0
record.

Pitt‘s hounding defense got the
Lady Panthers off to a I0-2 lead
early in the first half. Debbie Lewis
opened the game with a layup. fol-
lowed by Jennifer Bruce with
another layup. Pam Miklasevich
added a jumper. and Carol l)ugan

scored with two more layups off

steals to stun the Lad I Eales.

-‘.54?

 

 

Dugan. Lewis and Gail Augh-
burns took turns sinking baskets in
the next four minutes to give the
Lady Panthers a 26-l0 lead at the
l2:4O mark.

The Lady Panther defense then
put Niagara on idle for the next six
minutes while the Pitt offense revved
its engine. driving to a 45-14 lead.
Bruce and Dugan each hit for scores
on ten-foot shots. while Beth Tarasi
and Lori Arent laid the ball in off of
two consecutive Dugan steals. Bruce
followed through on a missed shot.
and Lewis added a fancy layup to
cap the onslaught. Temporarily.

Most ofthe last five minutes ofthe
first half were spent at the foul line.
where Niagara swished six of nine
fregth_row-'s-to outscore Pitt 20-I3.

  

Pitt took a 62-36 halftime lead to the
locker room.

“I don't think I've ever had a team
score 62 points in one half." said
Coach Judy Saurer. “We were hot.
and we were holding them in check
most of the time.“

The Lady Panthers built on the
lead in the second half, holding Nia-
gara scoreless in the opening six
minutes. Lewis led the charge with
two baskets, while Miklasevich and
Aughburns each added one. Bruce
went on to add seven more points,
and at the I0 minute mark. Pitt had
its biggest lead ofthe contest, 83-42.

At that point the Lady Panther
reserves took over and preserved the
victory. Freshman Becky Malian
led the way with eight points in the

 

final ten minutes. Niagara attempt-
ed a comeback. tallying eight unan-
swered points. but it was much too
little. much too late.

Lewis led the Lady Panthers with
l9 points. Bruce added l5. Maziarz
put in ll, and Lynn Love, Dugan
and Miklasevich each had l0. Pam
Lee of Niagara led all scorers with
24. The Lady Panther defense forced
40 turnovers and dominated the
rebounding game, 54-30.

“I was pleased to see our shooting
percentage improve." said Saurer.
“The defense also had some excep-
tional moments. but we haveto keep

working. It's not going to get any
easier.”
The competition will be tough this
