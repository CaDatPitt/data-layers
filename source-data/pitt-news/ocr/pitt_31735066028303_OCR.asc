Two publications coll Pitt
o second-tier institution

Jessyca Vandercoy
For The Pltt News

Choosing a college is a diffi-
cult decision to make, and often,
high school seniors rely on maga-
zine rankings to help them decide
which one to attend. Fortunately
for Pitt, two magazines recently
listed it as being among the top
universities in the country.

U.S. News & World Report, in
its 1998 university—rankings edi-
tion, ranked Pitt in the second tier
for overall quality. Although Pitt
was not ranked individually within
the second tier, its ranking was
high enough for it to be named one
of the top 117 institutions in the
nation. '

The magazine examined 1,330
public and private colleges and
universities across the country,
ranking schools on criteria such as
their national reputation and
acceptance and retention rates.

After scoring each institution,

—U.S. News &World Report ranked

Pitt's national reputation as 2.7 on
a 4.0 scale. This ranking tied Pitt
with George Washington
University, Boston University and
Virginia Tech.

Pitt also received recognition
as a school offering a "high quali-
ty of education" at a "reasonable
cost" on the magazine's “best
value” list. Pitt ranked 44th on this
list.

The magazine's web site cited
statistics to support Pitt's high
ranking, such as the fact that only
60 percent of Pitt graduates end up
owing money after they graduate,
averaging debts of about $17,000.
According to the study, students
who graduate from other public
institutions with a bachelor's
degree usually owe almost twice
what Pitt students will owe.

In August, the University was
also named one of the "best val-
ues" in higher education by Money
magazine. Pitt ranked in the top
150 of Money magazine's list of
"best buys" in higher education,
beating out New York University,

Texas A&M and Marquette
University.

This ranking was based on sta-
tistics such as class size, cost of
tuition and the amount of
resources available to students.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service
said that the University's rankings
in the mag— .
azines were
commend-
able. "It
gives recog-
nition to the
o v e r a 1 1

tion at this ,; A _

college or

university.
He recommends that prospective
students look not at just one num-
ber or ranking when choosing an
institution but also at the criteria
used to rank the school.

For example, Service pointed
out that Pitt's alumni-contribution
ranking was low, bringing down
the University's overall ranking.
He said he believed that a school's
reputation, a category in which Pitt

ranked highly, should be weighed '

more heavily than alumni contri-
butions. This change in scoring
would give Pitt a higher overall
ranking.

Pitt was the only Pennsylvania
university mentioned in both mag-
azines.

Faculty retirement package is put on October’ agenda

Melissa Blackwood

Staff Writer

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
announced that the proposed faculty-
retirement incentive package will
most likely be on the board of trustees‘
October agenda.

Nordenberg's announcement came
in response to complaints made last
week by many faculty members" that
the University has failed to act on a
plan submitted by the faculty in June.

According to Nordenberg, the
final decision is not up to him because
it would require changes to this year's
budget

"This is a matter which for bud-
getary and other reasons would
require approval of the board of
trustees," he told professors at
Monday's Senate Council meeting.

One professor, however, wanted
to hear Nordenberg's opinion of the
plan's chances.

"I haven't heard yet if you have a
recommendation, and if you do, if you
are willing to tell us what it is," said
Robert Gibbs, professor of pharmacy
and therapeutics. ‘

"You're right," Nordenberg
responded. "There will be a public
recommendation by me, but at this
point, while there are still discussions
going on, I will not comment further
on it."

Professors also asked Nordenberg
to clear up recent confusion surround-
ing the relationship between Pitt's

Yesterday attemoon’s Senate Council meeting, attended by faculty, staff, and students, was the first of the school year.

School of Medicine and the
University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center Systems.

Last week, a. faculty committee
looking into the relationship discov-
ered the existence of a University-
UPMCS task force. However, com-
mittee members could not find out
who is on it or what its purpose is.

Nordenberg assured Senate
Council members yesterday that the
group is only advisory.

"They are financial and legal rep-
resentatives of the University,
UPMCS and the federated practice
plans that are essentially acquiring
information that we deem to be neces-
sary," he said. "They are not negotiat-

ing anything."

In June, Nordenberg announced
plans to separate some functions of
the School of Medicine and the med-
ical center that they currently perform
jointly.

He said that since this announce-
ment, talks between officials of both
organizations have been progressing.

Philadelphia man scales 40-story building without using ropes

Across the Nation

REDMOND, Wash. _ Microsoft has
pushed back the release of the
Windows '95 upgrade. g

The reason the release has been
delayed is because Microsoft wants to
make the upgrade to its older pro-
grams, such as Windows 3.1, at the
same time using the same software.

Windows '98 has been delayed as
well. It was originally slated for
release in early 1998, but it has been
pushed back to the second quarter of
the year. .

Microsoft said it has become clear
to it that customers did not want to
have to select from’ separate products
to upgrade to the new operating sys-
tem. Retailers would be burdened by

two separate products and two inven- I

tories.
Windows '95 now runs on more
than 100 million computers.

GARY, Ind.— One person is dead,
and at least seven more were injured
when a tractor trailer collided with an
Amtrak train.

Police said that the truck driver
drove around a set of lowered crossing
gates and was hit by the oncoming
train.

The truck driver was killed in the
accident. Sixteen train passengers
were taken to the hospital as a precau-
tion.

An Amtrak spokesman said the
crash caused four passenger cars to
derail but that they did not overturn.

According to the Amtrak
spokesman, the crash was the fourth
fatality at the busy crossing in the past
five years. i

The train was traveling from
Grand Rapids, Mich., to Chicago.

BROWNSVILLE, Texas — Illegal

"We're brought out here as a

local agency, helped promote
Hershey by handing out candy

Stathopowlos is excited to be
part of an event like this.

"I think it's great," she said.
"I like the festive atmosphere."

effect on wildlife.

Experts say that border-patrol for-
tification of the Rio Grande with
agents and ﬂoodlights has obstructed
the migration of endangered animals.
Among the animals in danger are the
nocturnal ocelot and jaguarundi cats.

Last week the United States Fish
and Wildlife Service asked the border
patrol to consider removing the lights.

The border patrol will hire an
independent expert to determine to
what extent the lights may be used
without disturbing the endangered ani-
mals.

PHILADELPHIA A French
climber wearing a superhero costume
scaled a downtown skyscraper without
ropes. '

The man climbed the more-than-
40-story Blue Cross Building‘ at 19th

reaching the top. Witnesses_ said he
stopped to smoke a cigarette on the
way to the top. ‘

The climber used chalk and may

Police say that charges will be

Around the World  

WINDHOEK, Namibia — Searchers
off the coast of Africa have found
wreckage, but no people, where two
military planes disappeared two days
ago.
A C-141 Starlifter cargo plane car-
rying nine Americans collided with a
German plane carrying 24 people off
the shore of Namibia.

Military officials from both coun-
tries are trying to determine what hap-
pened, and why it took 24 hours
before rescue officials were aware the
planes were missing.

Searchers have found seats from
the German plane along with papers
with German writing in the area, but
there is no sign of the American plane.

The Atlantic Ocean is 3,000 feet
deep in the area of the crash; officials
doubt that any wreckage will be
found.  .

Dorm life: more space, less comfort

Andrea

 

Reasons why Pilt should  

have been ranked‘ #1

Pitt should be ranked Number One in the whole world!

The latest US. News & World Report rankings of univer-
sities in this country list Pitt as a good school, and Money lists
it as a great buy, but they still suggest that Pitt is a second—tier
school. Well, that’s wrong. We’re the best, and we have lots of
reasons to believe why. Here they are:

First of all, we’ve got a brand new name: Pittsburgh. And
it’s so original, too. (Too bad nobody will ever call it anything
besides Pitt.)

And we’ve got new colors ———- the same as Notre Dame’s.
Next thing you know, we’ll have a top-ranked football team
because of them. ’ ,

‘There’s a guy on our basketball team named Atilla. Now
how many athletics programs can boast that, huh?

Who can overlook the great amusement value of this
school when students get to play frogger with moving vehicles
as they cross Bigelow Boulevard, only to wait in line for a long,

bouncy ride on a Cathedral elevator —— just like Kennywood? ‘

We have the tallest educational building in the Western
Hemisphere. Like the Tower of Babel, we’re closer to heaven.
That’s something. ‘

Our student government can outspend any other student
government in the free world. V

Don’t forget that Pitt has what is believed to be the largest
collection of porno, er, “erotic literature,” in our very own
Hillman Library Special Collection.

And there’s always the O, which has the No. 1 most vile
restrooms in the country. Repeat: No. 1! ,

Goldilocks might point out how cold it must be year ‘round
at MIT, and how unseasonably warm UCLA is in December,
but that Pittsburgh weather is “just right.”

We are much closer to “dahn—tahn” Pittsburgh than is
almost every other university._And the university that is even
closer to the city? Well, that shouldn’t even count — it’s
Duquesne. But we’re second closest, which is still better than
CMU in that regard.

With all this considered, it’s amazing that Pitt wasn’t -

ranked Number One in the country, isn’t it? We just don’t
understand. I

Workman

I’m attending college with
35,000 of my closest friends,
just like the brochure said.
What it didn’t tell me was that
a significant percentage of
them would live in my dorm
room.

I am living in Lothrop
Hall, in one of the lounges that
had been converted into a five-
person “quad.” Our room is
very big, but the University
barely provided basic living
requirements for one person,
let alone five. Between the
three.of us, we have two TVs,

' but only one cable hookup; we

are soon to have two comput-
ers, but have one ethernet con-
nection.

This is the only room I
have ever seen on campus
without its own sink. This
forces us to go past the eleva-
tors, through the doors, and
down a long hall to the bath-
room every time we want a
drink of water.

Besides being very incon-
venient, having to go to the
bathroom to get it doesn’t
make the water seem very
appealing. It is one of those
places where you have to wear
shoes or you’ll slide around on
the slimy ﬂoor. I’m not sure
how often they clean the sinks,
but I do know that if I had my
own, it would definitely be
cleaner. '

This situation could have
been avoided. Apparently the
University extended the hous-
ing-application deadline by at

least a month, so that poor,
continually late fools like me
could miss the second dead-
line by a few days (which hap-
pened), only to be told that it
was okay —— deadlines were
really just guidelines, anyway
(which also happened).

I certainly can’t claim that
the college gave me a bad
break, since it did work out to
my advantage. I even ended up
with only two roommates, in a
room with enough space for
ﬁve. But, my question is: Why
did it do it?

Is the
University real-
ly so hard up
for cash that it
needs to let
everybody who

asks have a
room, regard-
less of how

much room it
actually has to
give them?

That’s the
only logical
reason I can
think of for
what happened.
The costs of taking the TV out
of a lounge and setting up five
beds, small closets, and desks
in it are more than covered by
the $2,000 or so that everyone
with a dorm room paid to live
here, not to mention the
mandatory meal plan for
everyone in the dorms. What
are they doing with all this
extra money, since they’re not
using it to build another dorm,
or to repair the scarily bad ele-
vators?

THE PITT N WS

She said

Carnegie Mellon
University, I’m told, had a
similar problem last year. But
CMU came up with a solution
—— it put some students in local
hotels until their dorms were
ready for the students to live
in. Why can’t Pitt do some-
thing comparable?

Pitt is supposed to be
building a new dorm soon, but
I don’t see any students ‘stay-
ing at the Holiday Inn. Instead,
students are being piled into
lounges like the stacks of dol-
lar bills that are
in the eyes of the
campus adminis-
tration.

Whatever the
U n i v e r s i t y
decides to do, I
hope it comes up
with some solu-
tion, whether it
be building a
new dorm,
putting students
up in hotels or
just not letting as
many students
have housing.

I can picture
the housing administrators sit-
ting in their offices saying,
“Look at all that extra space in
the bathrooms and the laundry
rooms. We still don’t have any
students in there. Let them all
in. We can build a dorm next
year.”

Andrea Workman is a fresh-
man at Pitt who didn’t expect
that she ’d have to take a bus to
go get a shower in the mom-

mg.

A farewell to a
  Philadelphia
legend

One of my childhood heroes is dead.

Richie Ashbum passed away at the age
of 70 in his sleep last week in a New York
hotel after calling a Phillies-Mets game a
few hours earlier. -

Any sports fan from the other side of
the state knows his voice. He’d been broad-
casting Phillies games since his retirement

9 from baseball in 1962.

For me, “Whitey” — the name by
which he was known by millions of fans
—-— was summer. Every night when I was a
scrappy little tyke with major-league

dreams I would listen to Phils games via .

my bedroom’s boombox. As I grew up in
Lancaster, Pa., Phillies games on l490AM
were a daily ritual for me.

Whether I was in my car, mowing the
grass, or playing ‘basketball in my drive-
way, “Whitey” was there.

My favorite innings were always the
ﬁrst three and the last three, because tl1at’s
when “Whitey” and Harry Kalas, his
broadcasting partner since 1971, were on
the air. The combination of Kalas’ stern,
echoing voice with Ashburn’s witty, comi-
cal rhetoric was legendary.

He wasn’t the best color guy ever, but
just listening to those wonderful stories of
his playing days made up for what he
lacked in speaking skills.

Many times he would stay quiet for
several minutes, and then he’d chime in
with a story about how in “his day”
ballplayers played with broken bones and
didn’t sit out with foot cramps. ’

He was direct, always pointing out
when a player didn’t hustle or made a mis-
take.

Ashbum was always on former
Phillies second baseman Juan Samuel, say-
ing “for as much speed as he has, he sure
doesn’t hustle.”

He never could have been a network
broadcaster because he was just too darn
honest.

“Whitey” wasn’t a friend of a bad
umpire, either. On many replays during
each game, he would point out, “That is a
ball by a foot, Harry.” Kalas would just
laugh -—- along with every listener.

My favorite bit that the twosome did
every game was the sponsored trivia ques-
tion. Kalas would start with a “Hey,
Whitey, see if you can get this one,” and
then read the question. Ashbum would
think about the answer — sometimes for a
pitch or two, but more often than not an
inning or two.

Freshman invasion leads Pitt Tennis

Robert J. Kidwell

For The Pitt News

Despite having a
benchmark 1996 season
that saw the Lady Panthers
eclipse the school’s all-
time win record with 17,
Coach George Dieffenbach
and the rest of the Pitt
women’s tennis team are
looking for even better
things coming into the
1997 campaign.

“Our team is stronger
this year with new fresh-
man at the top of the line-
up,” said Dieffenbach.
“This enables other players
who have match-play
experience from last year
to move down, and that
creates depth in the line-

Young team goes through

These two take the
helm at one and two sin-
gles, respectively, where
they replace senior Fran
Davis (11-16 last season),
who will be playing at
third singles, and Erin
Shalbrack, who is tem-
porarily out of the lineup
due to off—season knee
surgery. She is expected to
compete later in the year,
according to Dieffenbach.

Last year, on the
strength of Davis and
Shalbrack at the top of its
lineup, Pitt capped a four-
year string in which the
Lady Panthers established
their own identity and
gained some respect from
their opponents.

Volleyball back to .500 after Wisconsin tourney

Matt Grove

Staff Writer

The pieces are coming together for
the Pittsburgh women’s volleyball team,
but with a schedule as hard as Chinese

-aritlrmetic, it’s going to take some time

before the team’s youth is served.

“In the last match of the weekend, we
started all freshmen, sophomores and only
one junior —— and they’re getting better,”
said Head Coach Cindy Alvear. “We don’t
have much Division I experience, but we
are as talented and skilled as most other
teams.”

The Lady Panthers dropped two out
of three matches in the Wisconsin
Tournament over the weekend.

Alvear took her team up against unde-
feated (5-0) University of Wisconsin
Friday night and fell to the Lady Badgers
in three straight games, 15-8, 15-8 and 15-
8.

“Wisconsin is the real deal. They are
a Top 15 team in thecountry, and they are

only behind Penn State, the No. 1 team in
the nation, in the Big 10,” Alvear added.

Melissa Alpers led Pittsburgh with six
kills in only two games, while a trio of
Lady Panthers —— Tara Haefner, Karen
Reisiger and Paula Zernrowski —-- all
added four kills apiece. Haefner also
chipped in with a tearn-high 25 assists and
nine digs. 1

Wisconsin was led by Marisa
Mackey’s nine kills and Colleen Neel’s
four kills and 36 assists.

Saturday morning didn’t start oﬂ’ well
for Pittsburgh, either, as it dropped anoth-
er decision — this time to Ball State
University, 15-6, 15-3 and 15-5.

Alvear credited Ball State’s win to its
experience and strength.

‘‘They started all seniors, juniors and
one sophomore,” said Alvear. “Our play-
ers were hesitant in the beginning, and
once we lost the ﬁrst game, the bottom
totally fell out. Once the maturity level
rises, our girls will learn how to get
through these things.”

Pittsburgh managed only 19 kills and
18 assists in the match, while Ball State (4-
4) notched 36 kills, led by Lindsay
Follins’ nine. Emily Sallee had 26 of Ball
State’s 28 assists in the win.

The Lady Panthers faced 1-11
\V1sconsin—Green Bay in the nightcap for
the rights to third place and a .500 record.
Pittsburgh struggled but pulled out a four-
game win, 15-11, 12-15, 15-4 and 16-14.

“Although their record is heinous,
Green Bay has played a lot of close match-
es,” said Alvear. “We are pleased  the
way we played towards the end of A the
tournament. They fought a lot harder and
executed on a much higher leve .”

Marcia Thiesen and Peggy Meinhart
led the way for Pittsburgh with 16 kills
apiece. Lisa Riggle recorded an impres-
sive 56 kills. Haefner chipped in with 17
digs, as Meinhart added 16 and Thiesen
13.

The Lady Panthers travel to the
University of Tennessee next weekend to
tangle with Tennessee and Iowa.

Cross country runsthrough injuries at West Virginia meet

Geoff Moak
Staff Wrlter

The undermanned Pitt men’s and
women’s cross-country teams partic-

ipated in a meet at West Virginia"

University on Saturday and finished
fifth out of five teams in both races.

In the women’s race, Virginia
Tech’s 43 points edged out East
Tennessee State’s 46 for the win,
under a system in which the team
with the fewest points wins. Pitt had
120_ points.

Georgetown’s men scored only
25 points to win the men’s race fair-
ly easily over second-place West
Virginia. Pitt’s men had 142 points.

Even though Pitt was beaten
soundly by two Big East teams
(Georgetown and West Virginia), the
most disturbing aspect of the meet is
the injury report.

Scott Curry fell and twisted his
knee while trying to recover from
another injury. This twisted knee
may end his season. He will undergo

an MRI on Wednesday.

Matt Samuel made it about a
third of the way through the race
before twisting his ankle. Samuel’s
injury is not as serious as Curry’s,
but it was enough to keep him from
finishing the race.

For the women, freshman Sarah
McMillen twisted her ankle and
missed the race. Amy Francy, Pitt’s
top runner at the season-opening
meet at Kent State, came down with
a mysterious infection.

“It looked like bites on her legs.
We don’t know what the cause was.
She had it [at Kent State] and it hurt,
but it didn’t keep her from running,”
said Pitt Head. Coach Dave Sobal.

By the time Saturday’s meet
came around, Francy had a full-
blown infection. Instead of racing,
she was being “pumped full of
antibiotics,” according to Sobal.

The Panthers were undermanned
to begin the season. With the latest
round of injuries, the men couldn’t
even field a team of five true dis-

tance runners. A handful of middle-
distance runners from the track team
rounded out Pitt’s squad.

“When you’re only as deep as
Panther Hollow Lake, you can’t
afford to have people on the side-
lines,” Sobal said.

Those Panthers who did run did
well. The men were led by freshman
Mike Orzechowski. Along with
Samuel, he was in the lead pack at
the mile mark. Orzechowski went on
to finish 22nd in 27:51.

This race was slightly more than

five miles, compared to the men’s
four-mile race last week, and it was
also on an extremely slow, hilly
course. Pitt’s top three men —
Orzechowski, Matt Hornsby, and
Max Itkin — still ran faster in the
first four miles of this week’s race
than they did last week.
Hornsby finished 40th in 29:02, 40
seconds faster than he ran on the
same course last year. Itkin was
right behind him, in 41st place, with
29:03.

The women were led by Lynda
Andros. After a fast start, Andros
dropped to roughly 25th place
before rebounding to finish 16th.
She ran the five—ki1ometer course in
20:15.

“She needs to work on the mid-
dle stages of the race,” Sobal said.
“But to have that kind of time on
that kind of course could translate to
her running around 18 minutes by
the end of the year.”

Of the women who ran both
races so far this year, most actually
were faster on the tougher West
Virginia course.

1 This week, the Panthers have a
much—needed break. Their next race,
one of the biggest of the regular sea-
son, is the Spiked—Shoe Invitational
at Penn State. .

“These first two were the ‘fun’
meets,” Sobal said. “If we don’t

' improve at Penn State, I’ll ‘be really

disappointed. That will be the first
meet where we start preparing for
the Big East championship meet.”

TENNIS

12th and last year 10th. The past four
years have seen our best teams go
through [the system].”

Other starters on this year’s squad
include senior Amanda Hoffman at
fourth singles, junior Jennifer Bible at
fifth, and sophomores Allison Bucher
and Natalie D’Amore at sixth and
seventh singles, respectively.

Another freshman, Jennifer Katz,
rounds out the singles starters by
playing in the eighth position. These
rankings are used to match players
from opposing teams against oppo-
nents of similar ability. Teams receive
one point for each singles win,
regardless of seed.

Positions were established
through the use of a round-robin tour-
nament, in which team members were
forced to compete among themselves.

The Panthers’ first test came this
past weekend when they traveled to
Morgantown for the West Virginia
University Invitational Tournament.

The Lady Panthers competed
against 15 different schools from the
East and the Midwest. The ladies par-
ticipated in both singles and doubles
in a double-elimination ﬂight touma-
ment. ‘

The ﬂights were divided into A,
B, C and D. The A ﬂight saw the first
and second singles players compete,
the B ﬂight saw the third and fourth
singles players compete, and so on
down the lineup.

Bright spots included the perfor-
mance of one vaunted freshman who
received her first taste of collegiate

FROM PAGE 10

competition.

Number-one player freshman
Lindsay Carlson overcame a first-
round defeat to perform very well in
the consolation section of her bracket.
This included a 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5)
thriller against Yanelle Valentine of
Duquesne. I

Dieffenbach commented on the
match, saying “This is a good win for
her confidence and
progress.”

The rest of the
singles players fell
prey to the first-
round bug with the
exception of
Hoffman at four
singles, Boucher at
sixth singles and
D’Amore at seven.

Hoffman was
able to reach the
semifinals of her
consolation bracket
before she fell to
Jodie Hurley of
Cornell by a score
of 6-3, 6-0. .   .,

Bucher escaped the first round
through a default but lost in the sec-
ond round of the main draw to Ann
Gorman of Duquesne 3-6, 6-1, and 6-
1.

D’Amore had impressive wins
against Duquesne’s Jamie J asinski, 6-
3, 6-3, and Akron’s Kananh Diep, 6-
4, 7-5, before she was defeated by
Danielle Martinez of the University
of Maryland, 6-1, 6-1. I

In ﬂight A of the doubles, the
freshman combination of Carlson and

   

Jafarain had a run which included
defeating Duquesne’s No. 1 team in
an 8-5 match. Carlson and Jafarain
then bowed out in the consolation
bracket finals to Mid—Atlantic
Conference powerhouse Bowling
Green, 9-8, in a tie-break. .
The second doubles team of
Hoffman and Davis fared the same,
falling in the ﬂight B consolation
finals by a score of
8-5.
The third and

fourth doubles
teams of Bible-
Boucher and

D’Amore-Katz each
reached the quarter-
finals of their main
draw before losing
to teams from
Eastern Michigan
and West Virginia,
respectively.

“This tourna-
ment was a very
good experience,”
said Dieffenbach.
  . “We spent a lot of
time In practice competing for seeds,
so we did not have a lot of time to
work on drills or our mechanics, but
the girls responded well.”

Dieffenbach added, “This was a
better showing than last year, mostly
because the girls responded very
well. They all received exposure to
college competition, and they also
received a fitness workout, having all
participated in some lengthy match-
es.” ’

Though doing well in this touma-

 

ment was a good stepping stone for
the team, Dieffenbach has his atten-
tion on other Big East competitors.

“The girls need to strive to work
hard because doing well in the Big
East is what really matters,” said
Dieffenbach.

Competition will surely be stiff
from teams the likes of Miami and
Notre Dame, who are consistently
ranked in the nation’s top 25. Pitt’s
main adversaries make their appear-
ance in force during the Big East
Tournament in late April.

The fact that the Lady Panthers
are looking forward to this late-sea-
son batch of grade-A competition
shows the amount of progress the
team has made. Dieffenbach has truly
seen a change in women’s tennis
since he took over the program in
1981.

“Today the women hit harder, hit
more accurately, they are more physi-
cally fit, they are quicker and even
stronger,” commented Dieffenbach.

Dieffenbach, himself a 1975 Pitt
graduate, has taken these tools and

fashioned a winning 145-124 record

during his 16 years at Pitt.

His recipe for success has been
centered on three very important
goals: “Graduate the seniors, have a
winning record and improve the Big
East standing.”

Although the majority of this
year’s matches are away, home
matches can be found either indoors
at the Cost Center or outside at
Carnegie Mellon’s courts. The team
opens its home season on Wednesday,
Oct. 8, versus Robert Morris.

Beasley leads Panther soccer in its second season

John Abernathy

For The Pitt News

If there’s one thing that
Pitt’s women’s soccer team
needed in last year’s inaugural
season, it was a sparkplug
player who could get the pro-
gram moving in the right direc-
tion. It seems that sophomore
Megan Beasley is exactly the
spark plug the team was
searching for. A

After compiling a 3-16
record last year, the Panthers’
primary goal for this season
was simply to improve. The
team was counting on another
big year from the sophomore to
make the jump to the next
level.

“We are
improve every game, and we
are improving tactically,”
Beasley said.

Pitt plays in the Big East,
the nation’s toughest women’s
soccer conference, which could
mean another rough year for
the Panthers. This challenge,
however, doesn’t frighten
Beasley.

“No one believes it’s going
to come easy,” she said. “To
get better you have to play

looking to ~

against the best.”

Beasley hails from
Longmont, Colo., so what
exactly brought her to
Pittsburgh and a soccer pro-
gram that had no history?

“I liked the enthusiasm of
everyone here,” explained
Beasley. “I liked the academic
opportunities.”

Pitt Head Coach Roland
Sturk, also from Colo., recruit-
ed Beasley to join him when he
was hired. Upon arriving,
Beasley and other first—year
recruits had to face the difficult
task of building and surviving a
ﬁrst—year program.

“I came in last year not
knowing what to expect,”
Beasley explained. “This is all
so much faster than high
school.”

She adapted well, becom-
ing part of a nucleus of players
who provided the young team
with leadership throughout its
first year. Last year, she estab-
lished herself as the team’s
leading scorer, and she is now
one of the team’s captains.

Her work ethic —— a com-
mon theme associated with
Pittsburgh sports today — is
just one of the valuable assets

hard. She’s totally intense.”

At a young age, Beasley
planted the seeds that have pro-
pelled her to a successful soc-
cer career. She began playing
at the age of five, and her skills
developed thanks to family
support, her natural ability and
her hard work.

As a high—school volley-
ball player, she earned three
varsity letters and three acade-
mic state honors, helping her
team to two state titles.

In soccer, she earned four
academic all—state honors, four
varsity letters and was the first
person in her high school to
ever receive all—conference
honors for each of her four
years. On top of this, she was
named the Colorado High

“She is a hard worker who

As for her plans after grad-

her talent and hard work, either
option seems within reach.

I would often forget the question with-
in a couple of minutes, but then out of
nowhere came “Whitey” with a “How
about that Stan Musial?” Or, if he thought
he himself could be the answer, he said,
“How about that me?”

He was a rare throwback to a time
when baseball was truly America’s pas-
time. Also, he was a constant reminder of
how wonderful and storied the game of
baseball really is.

I don’t remember how many times I
heard the story about his eight singles with
eight different bats in a doubleheader. He
would often bring this one up when a play-
er seemed to blame the bat for a bad swing.

“Harry, it’s not the bat, it’s the guy
who’s swinging it.”

Or the story about how he hit the same
fan with a foul ball twice in the same at bat.
He hit a woman once, and then as the
medics were carrying her away in a stretch-
er he hit her again.

“Whitey” could look at something and
describe it in an off—the—wall manner that
just made you laugh. He, coined the term
“runnerish” —- a word, that remains unde-
ﬁned —- in describing a base runner.

And when he didn’t know what to say,
he calmly announced,“Hard to believe,
Harry.”

Along with his humor, Ashburn was
able to transmit his love of the game to his
listeners. He made fans of many
Phi1adelpl1ians—- even though the Phillies
have had just one winning season since
1988. ’

He was loved in a city known for its
cynical and rude nature. Philadelphia had
suspended its nasty streak toward Ashburn
ever since his rookie year in 1948, when he
won the Rookie of the Year Award and bat-
ted .333 with 32 stolen bases as the
Phillies’ center ﬁelder.

He won two batting titlesand batted
over .300 nine times in his career. Ashburn
was inducted into the Baseball Hall of
Fame in 1995 by its Veterans Committee.

Whitey had been part of Philadelphia’s
sports life for 47 years and part of mine for
15, and now he’s gone.

Along with his passing goes an era in
Philly sports that may not have meant
many championships but that did mean
many enjoyable summer afternoons.
