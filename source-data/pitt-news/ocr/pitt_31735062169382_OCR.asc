Students To Decide «

On

NEW HAVEN, Conn.
(CPS)—The students in Pro-
fessor Robert Cook’s “Soci-
ology 20” seminar at Yale
will all receive grades of “sat-
isfactory” this term, but

they aren’t satiﬁed at all. Nei-
ther is Cook.

Early in the semester Cook
had asked the class to vote on
whether or not they wanted
grades. The students voted not to
be graded, and asked Cook to
ihform Yale Register Grant Rob-
ley of their decision.

Robley advised‘ Cook that uni-
versity regulations required that
a numerical grade be given at

the end of the year-long seminar,

although grades of “satisfactory”
or “unsatisfactory” could be re-
corded at the end of the ﬁrst
half of the course. '

Following Robley’s declaration,
Cook’s students voted again—to
give themselves numerical grades
of 100. This action was too much
for the Yale Daily News, which
editorialized:

“Because of their decision to
send in an absurd. and unfair
batch of grades rather than no
grades at all, the meaningfulness
of an originally positive gesture
has turned sour.”

The campus paper suggested
the seminar students were “sab-
otaging both the Yale College
average and the integrity of their
own stand. Their move is the

‘ ultimate example of having their

cake and eating it too.”

Soon after this action, Cook met
with Yale College Dean Georges
May to discuss the school’s entire
grading system. May recommend-

Question of Grades 

fore Ya.le’s Course of Study Gom- __._
mittee, which has control of the 

school’s grading system. 
Following the meeting, Cooked

announced his agreement to turn . . ‘S
in gades of “satisfactory” for"
_ the ﬁrst semester's work. 
While May stated, “I think we ~ .

have reached an understanding,”

Cook commented, “I do not in-

tend to teach for a long time un- '
der a system where I cannot
teach the way I want.”

As one pages through the lists of tappees in this issue he might
realize that the lists for certain groups.a-re rather brief. These honoraries,
established to recognize campus leadership, in other terms have had long us.
lists of names which represent the breath of the campus leaders. But some -

.1,‘ of these groups have shown a disturbing pettiness in their selection of
-' membership. The numbers of tappees in these instancesare not so small
because the campus lacks eligible people who are worthy of this honor.

It is because all too many of the present members of these honoraries have
decided that they will elect no one who is at variance with their view point

on campus issues; theyesimply will not admit a student who is on theother

side of the fence.

What can account for this mindset? We are certain that one source
of trouble is the Student Government election campaign. For months can-
didatesprepared speeches, platforms and then eventually endlessly cam-
paigned for their positions. Some who were not actually running for office
worked equally hard for those they felt could best lead the student body.
Candidates and supporters became deeply involved in the campaign and all
too often they developed an emotional involvement which was completely
out of proportion to the importance and worth of the office they were seek-

In the course of public debates wordsoften became harsh and heated.
Such moments are not quickly forgotten by either the participants or the

' Editor, Pitt News:
Obviously it is too late to com-
plain about the pass-fail option
which Liberal Arts has adopted,
but I would like to enter an ob-
jection and point out pitfalls that
both students and faculty have
ignored. 
Like most faculty, I am not
happy with grading systems. I
dislike having to make judgment
and I dislike what the Selective
Service does with grades. I also
dislike the system of monetary
. reward in ourlsociety; I actually
know people who work only for
/ the salary they receive as I know
students who only work for
grades.
A faculty member owes his stu-
dent a thorough professional eval-
uation of the student’s work. It
A ‘must be very difficult for a phy-
sician to tell his patient that he
is sick, but it is part of the phy-
sician's professional responsibil-
ity to examine thoroughly and to
make an ‘evaluation. A student
submits his thought to a man of
greater knowledge and insight;
the professor owes it to the stu-
dent to make as thorough and
precise evaluation as he can. The
job‘ requires energy and drive.
If the professor knows that a
large percentage of his class does
not need evaluation, then he will
-not do it for any. I spend a min-
imum of one hour for each stu-
dent to reach an evaluation. If
that hour is apt to disappear into
a pass, then I will not bother for
all students. The pass-fail option
A therefore will harm that student

Letters to the Editor

who wants to submit his thought
to rigorous and thorough ana-
lysis.

It is an old rule of education
that minimum essentials are al-
ways translated into maximum
obligation. If the minimum es-
sential is to decide whether or
not the student passes or fails
(with our admission standards
and the requirement of upper di-
vision standing, an easy deci-
sion), then the maximum that
the faculty members owes to the
student is what the student al-
ready knows. When the student

pays his tuition, he pays to know 9

-—that he is capable o-f pass work.
It seems a waste of good money.

Right or wrong, the American
educational system is dedicated
to the idea that students should
think seriously about social prob-
lems, about art, and about natur-
al science. I know that many stu-
dents resent being asked to think
about science or the humanities.
Students want to be narrow spe-
cialists (it pays). The pass-fail
option makes it possible for a
student to go through the mo-
tions of thinking without ever
doing it or, if he does, without

' being told how well he succeeds.
‘The arguments for the pass-fail.

option are that (1) other schools
have tried it and we should
jump on the bandwagon (not al-
ways schools we would like to
emulate, but there is safety in
numbers) and (2) that it gives a
good student. in physics, for ex-
ample, the opportunity to get ex-
perience in the humanities with-
out fear of lowering his quality
point average. _
The ﬁrst arguments seems to
me to be grotesque. The Liberal

Arts Cabinet has read Time. The

second argument is equally un--

tenable. If a good students wants
an experience in the humanities
but does not want to submit his
thought to professional evalua-
tion, then he can very easily
audit the course. If he wants the
course on his record, he can even
take a paid audit. I have found,
however, that students who do
well in physics and chemistry
nearly always do well in my Eng-
lish course. The exceptions are
students who do not care; they
sit in class and do the minimum
work.- They will do a minimum
of work under the pass-fail o-p-
tion and thus reduce their grad-
uation requirement from 124 to
118 hours. Employees and grad-
uate schools will quickly judge
that the pass grade is a C (that
is what the C grade means). Thus
the option cheapens the degree.

The main argument against the
pass-fail option is that it will be

a ﬁnal blow against upperdivision ,

distribution courses. Possibly the
motive of the Liberal Arts Cab-
inet is to destroy these courses.
It will certainly not improve
them. I have never detected a
great interest among the faculty
to teach distribution courses.-
Some professors enjoy a large
audience, but many ﬁnd the ener-
gy given to these classes peri-
pheral to their own professional
interests. I learn from serious
students in my discipline,- but I
will not learn from students who
will be doing a minimum of ef-
fort. Nor do I like to be asked
to do a shoddy job. A physician
would certainly complain about
a physical that was -no more
than a cursory examination. I
am being asked not to do my job,
not to meet my professional ob-
ligation. Therefore, it will be in-'
creasingly difficult for depart-
to ﬁnd warm bodies to stand in
front of these classes. Chairmen
have enough trouble now staffing
these courses. Student complaints
will surely grow.

My hope is that students will

have the wit to see that a pass- .

fail option will give them noth-
ing and they will not elect it. It
may die a quiet death. The Lib-
eral Arts Cabinet can thus feel
that it has “‘done A something”
(however ill-examined) and cleans
can be pleased that they have
agreed, to a student suggestion

(however pointless and danger-.

cus it is). .

W’ th° n
observers. Many of the tapping meetings for. the honoraries came on the
heels of the Student Government and this ill will was still very much with
We can understand this having an effect upon the selection of those
who were particularly outspoken and offensive. What we can not stomach
is the exclusion of a person simply because he might of failed to give suf— .

ficient support to one group or because he might have objectively criti-
cized another.

I.

The 90th Session

 

.(/=

There are many inherent ills in such a situation. To begin the hon-
orary loses its purpose and its stature: in the eyes of the University com-
munity. Tappees eventually become a list of rather neutral people who
have offended no one and have not made any contribution of depth to
University leadership.

Secondly the more timid student will begin to hide his true opinions
out of fear that_an open declaration may effect his career at the University.
The knowledge that honorary members will spite those who have gone
against them can stifle ‘free expression at the University.

Students must finally ‘recognize that the bitterness shown in the
selection of tappees goes beyond these honoraries. This same pettiness
will reappear in the coming year when student leaders try to unite divergent
factions for common goals. It is a despicable situation, but we can only
hope that recognition of the problem is the ﬁrst step to solution.

Congress St the Draft

Associated Collegiate Press

The Selective, Service System
may face great changes when it
expires this June, speculates the
Kansas State University Collegi-
an.

The Collegian continued:

National legislators are expect-
ed to revolutionize the Selective
Service Law, ﬁrst enacted in
1951, during the 90th Congres-
sional session which convened
Jan. 10. Their problem is to ﬁnd
an alternative to the present
draft system.

Of about 18 million men of
draft age, all but ﬁve per cent
are exempt because of previous

-service, health, schooling, occu-

pation, marriage, or belief. Also
exempt are persons working in
the nation’s 4,061 draft boards
and in many other government
positions.

Because of a sizeable-drain on
the nation‘s military manpower
with the increasing combat de-
mands of the Vietnam war, some
untapped sources will have to

be found to supply the necessary

men. This is where the question
of student deferments comes in.

The current Selective Service
policy of granting deferments to
college students has become a
sensitive political question. The‘
main argument against such de-
ferments is that only the rich
can afford to -go to school, leav-

ing the poor to ﬁll military quo-
tas.

College students have no mono-
poly on mass deferment, how-
ever, Deferred students (2-S cate-
gory) number 1,523,830 compared
to 2,431,191 classiﬁed as substan-
dard (l-Y) and 2,498,023 total
rejects (4-F).

Graduate
many eligible males. With the
immediate reclassiﬁcation of col-
lege graduates to 1-A, there is a
growing trend to begin graduate
study, thus turning deferments
into exemptions, since many stu-
dents are too old or married with
children by the time they com-
plete graduate work.

In order to prevent college
from becoming a means of avoid-
ing s_ervice, however, draft laws
state that any deferred student
who is 2-S automatically becomes
eligible for the draft until he is
35.

Army officers, senators, paci-
ﬁsts, Pentagon experts, student

and government specialists met -

at the University of Chicago in
December and combined their
support for a system that would
begin drafting the youngest men
ﬁrst.

The new system, the group
said, would eliminate what they
considered the arbitrary and "ca-
pricious rules for student defer-
ments—rules which vary from
local board to local board.

, PITT STUDEN'l‘S no longer have to ride clattering streetcars because‘
‘ PAT has replaced them with new air conditioned buses.

1 , by IVAN ABRAMS
The University of Pittsburgh is no longer a streetcar

university. No more can commuting students ride the big

red cans to school, for on Jan. 27 the last regularly sched-

uled trollies ran through Oakland, ending a 108-year history

 

sity’s.present Student Union, had
» - been built. The district was oc-
Wcupied mainly by wealthy land
',_\__and -mine‘ owners who ﬁnanced
, the early transportation efforts.
, A ,By_1889, however, when a cable
3 car line replaced the horses on
. Fifth Ave., Oakland, was growing
Q -in size and ‘beginning to appear
,, ;_more urban. And, in 1899, when
  the ﬁrst electric streetcars were
" _ introduced, both Carnegie Insti-
Ctute and the Schenley Hotel were
standing.
 From a 1901 merger of the va-
rious public transportation com-
. - panies in the Pittsburgh area, the

the t-hen fashionable Pittsburgh suburb of Oakland, not even
the Schenley Hotel, the Univer- ,

veys to locate areas for cost re-
duction.

In the spring of 1966, PAT '~

announced plans to begin grad-
ually phasing. out Oakland and‘
eastern Pittsburgh streetcar

routes. Scheduled for eventual,

“bustitution,” or replacement by
buses, were routes 71, 73, 75, 76,
64, 66, and 67 all "of which pass-
ed the University. _

The ﬁrst step was taken by the
Port Authority on Labor when it
announced that buses would re-
place trollies on weekends, when
demands for service were less.
It promised that the substitution
would be permanent as soon ‘as
new buses, costing approximate-
ly $35,000 each, were purchased,
and January 1, 1967, was given
as the date for this.

The last streetcar carrying pas-
sengers through Oakland actually
ran on the morning of Jan. 28,
having started out of Craft Ave.
barn the night before. But, like
ghosts, streetcars continue to clat-
ter along Fifth Ave., appearing to
the casual observer no differ-
ent than those which not long ago
took them to and from their
jobs and ‘classes. These are not
mirages but cars en route to the
Port Authority's shops in Home-
wood, for streetcars are still op-
erated in some parts of the city
and the shop facilities would be
expensive to move to the still-
in-use Tunnel Car Barn. These
Fifth Ave. ‘tracks will remain in
service indeﬁnitely so that stu-

dents living in the dorms will’

not have to sleep without the
hollow, clatter-bang noises that
have sounded for overa century.

 

AUPT Produces “Arms and the Man”

Shaw’s Comedy Opens at Pitt 0

Bernard Shaw’s early comedy,
Arms and the Man, opens an
eight-day engagement on Friday
at Stephen Foster Memorial Au-
ditorium as the winter major pro-
duction of the University of Pitts-
burgh Theatre. Performances will
be held every evening except.
Monday at 8:30 with a matinee
on Sunday at 2:30 p.m.

Arms and the Man, which Shaw
describes as one of his “pleasant
plays,” is a sly ironic look at
conventional attitudes toward
love and war. Although it was
the third of Shaw’s play to be
published, it was the ﬁrst to be
accorded a professional produc-
tion. It has been frequently re-
vived, most notably by the Old
Vic. with Lawrence Olivier and
Ralph Richardson in the leading
roles.

Less obviously didactic and
gayer in tone than Shaw’s later
treatments of the same theme,
Arms and the Man, nevertheless,
is a mature and irreverent at-
tack on such establishment vir-
tues as glory and patriotism; as
such it retains considerable top-
icality. The University production

includes in the cast a broad cross- ~

section of the University com-.
munity. Donald Faryton, a sopho-

more, is appearing as the choco- '

late soldier, Blunschli, and Har-
riet Allen, a faculty Wife and a
graduate of the Yale Drama
School, appears as the roman-
tically-inclined Raina. Mrs. Al-
len will be remembered by Pitts-
burgh audiences for her perform-
ances at the Playhouse as Dor-
me in Tartuffe and Reenie in
Dark at the Top of the Stairs.
Here she played Pegeen Mike in
Playboy of the Western World
and is appearing as Inezin the
current Friday Night Theatre pro-
duction of No Exit. I
There are other familiar faces‘
in the cast as well. Graduate stu-

dent James’ Berry, who has ap-
peared many times at Stephen
Foster, Sergius the operatic hero
who is the butt of so much of
Shaw’s satire. Berry played Duke
Ferdinand in Pitt's fall revival of
The Duchess of Malﬁ, and is cur-
rently to be seen as Garcin in
No. Exit. Dan Frezza, a graduate
of Pitt’s Dental. School and a Uni-
versity fellow in speech, is Petk-
off. Frezza appeared earlier this
year as the Cardinal . in the
Duchess. Glorianne Engel, assis-
tant professor of theatre arts and
technical director -of the theatre,
head a supporting cast which in-
cludes Kathy Rennich, Greg Le-
hane, and Michael Stachowiak.
Lehane is also appeairing in

College Students “Turn on” with LSD

FDA Agents Search for Drug

by STEVEN A. BOOKSHESTER

WASHINGTON, D. C. (CPS)—
College students trying to “turn
on. tune in, and drop out” have
unwanted company, Dr. James
L. Goddard revealed recently.

Dr. Goddard is the commission-
er of the Food’ and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA), and the unwel-
come visitors to the campus LSD
scene are the 200 agents of FDA’s
Bureau of Drug Abuse Control.
The FDA agents, posing as stu-
dents, are buying LSD, amphe-
tamines, and other drugs at an
unknown number of school’s
throughout the nation.

The FDA commissioner’s state-
ment was in line with a letter he
sent to 2,000 college deans on
April 5, 1966, in which he warn-
ed of “the gravity of the situa-
tion” and asked for the assis-
tance of academic administrators

. “in combatting an insidious and

dangerous activity.”

Dr. Goddard asked that “any
instances‘ of the illegal use or
possession (of LSD and ampheta-
mines) should be reported at
once to the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration district office.” He
advised university officials to
“send us any questions you may
have which will aid in eliminat-
ing the illegal use of hallucino-
genic and stimulant drugs.”

Although FDA officials claim
they are primarily interested in
ﬁnding illegal sources of drug
supply rather than ﬁnding indi-
vidual users, theyadmit to co-
operating with local law enforce-
ment officials in geographical
areas where possession of such
drugs violates local law.

Federal statute prohibits the
sale of LSD, but possession for
individual use is not a criminal
act. FDA’s agents, however, are
authorized to use “executive seiz-
ure” in conﬁscating LSD under
the provisions of the Federal

Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Amend-
ments of 1965.

LSD, lacking FDA approval, is
not in “legal distribution.” After
20 years of research, it is still
classiﬁed as an “investigatory
new drug.”

were trained to be
of what the rights are.” The of-
ﬁcial’ stated, "‘It doesn’t make
any sense to make an arrest if
you’re going to be thrown out
ct’ court.”

specially trained at the Universi-
ty of California at Berkeley?s
School of Criminology. There, the
agents are taught law, techni-
ques of enforcement, criminology
and corrections, drugs, physical
evidence, accounting and audit- ~
ing, weapons training, physical
conditioning, and use of vehicles.
(A recent U.S. Senate report in-
clicates the largest_ number of
LSD users at any school exists
at Berkeley. The report attri-
buted 2,500 LSD users to the
Berkeley campus.)

were looking about the campus,
the debate over the implications
of LSD use continued at many
colleges. At others, administra-
ters were taking independent ac-
tion against student drug use.

Hugh Borton told students that
they faced possible suspension
for repeated drug use. Borton
said drug use is “largely socially
unacceptable and hence puts the
good name of the college in jeo-

Seizure is permissible because

An FDA official said that agents

Some FDA agents have been

pardy.” He said Haverford would
cooperate with all law enforce-
ment agencies “as a matterof
policy.”

Berton said the Pennsylvania
college has a physician, a psy-
chiatrist, and counselors available
t.;- discuss matters conﬁdentially
pertaining to drug use. He said
the ﬁrst use of drugs by a Haver-
ford student would be considered
a result of “lack of accurate in-
formation or of some medical or
psychological problem.”

, University of Montana Vice-
president Laurence E. Gale has
announced his school will consi-
der taking‘ disciplinary action
against student drug users. Mon-
tana’s Health Service Director Dr.
Robert B. Curry said, however,
that no students have reported to
the service‘ with _after - effects
from drugs during his two-year
tenure.

Amherst College’s Committee
on Guidance and Counseling mail-
ed a letter to the student body
indicating the school’s “concern
about the use of drugs because
of possible physical and psycho-
logical dangers and damaging ef-
fects to the individual user.” An
Amherst oﬂficial described the
purpose of the letter as “purely
educational and informational.”

Students at Amherst “desiring
further information, or wishing
to discuss conﬁdentially the im-
plications of drug use, are en-
couraged to visit the Counseling
Center or the Student Health
Office.”

Underprivileged children will
be able to ‘go to camp because of
thesPitt YMCA sponsored Fourth
Semi-annual “All-City Battle of
the Bands” to be held Friday
from 8:30 p.m. to midnight in the
SU Ballroom. (Admission IS 50
cents and an ID card from any
local school.) ,

One band will represent each
local school in a half-hour per-
formance. Participants will be:
“The lktremes” from Chatham
College, “Scurry Knaves” from
Mt. Mercy College, “Night Crawl-
ers” from Point Park College,
“Dave Ernest Trio” from Du-
quesne University,
from Robert Morris Junior Col-
lege, and the “Lovely Ones” from
the University. The Don Depolis
Jazz Quartet will provide enter-
tainment during‘ the intermission."

The camp is held in March
and April for boys and girls who
are served by Pitt YMCA Y-Corps
volunteer leaders working in six
Pittsburgh poverty neighbor-
hoods. Last year at Y Camp Kon-
O-Kwee, over 200 youngsters at-
tended . the camp. Without the
All-City event, many of these
children would have been unable
tc- have such a camp experience. -

These All-City programs are
designed to further cooperation
and interest among the Pitts-
burgh area colleges. Great i.nter-
est has been shown by thousands
attending the past Hootenanny

Population
Tolmnp

WASHINGTON, D. C. (CPS:)—
The college population of the
United States will increase four
times as fast as the national pop-
ulation during the coming de-
cade, the U.S. Office of Education
predicts. A ‘ E

The projected jump in college
enrollment is 49 per cent. The
Office of Education said that the
steep gain in enrollment is ex-
pected to result from higher birth‘
rates in the late 1940's and 1950’s,
together with the increasing pro-
portion of students who go to
college and then to graduate
school.” '

Colleges and universities are
expected to enroll aboutnine mil-
lion degree-seeking students in
1975-76, compared with 6.1 mil-
lion enrolled in 1966-67.

In addition, about one-third of
the college-age population (18 to
24) may be in higher education
institutions ten years from now.

The number of teachers in
higher education is not expected
to keep up with the increase in
student enrollment. The Office
of Education predicts that college
and university teachers may num-

ber 640,000 in 1975, up only ’36 .

per cent from this year's esti-
mate of 470,000.

Shildt’s Size Deception p
Catches Foes Napping

by ROY JACOBS
Someone seeing Dick Shildt moving onto the mat to

_ wrestle up at the Field House might ask. themselves what a

nice little boy like him is doing in a place-like that.

Shildt is five feet, two inches tall and weighs just about
123 pounds. He is friendly, but quiet and shy; and you’d
expect to ﬁnd him working in a library. But actually, he’s

right at home out there on the
mat. 

“I started wrestling in ninth
grade,” said Shildt. “The kids
weren’t that much bigger than I
was. I also played ninth grade
football, and even the big kids
were only 140 to 150.”

The big kids in college are a.
lot bigger, and Shildt admits he
hasn’t come across anybody short-
er than himself. But, he contin-
ues, “I’m stronger than the aver-
age 123 pounder, but-the boys
cutting from 150 or 140 are pretty
strong.”

Actually, Shildt would rather
wrestle a taller boy because “a
thinner boy gives me the impres-
sion of being weaker.

“I am deﬁnitely at an advan-
tage on my feet. They have trou-
ble with my legs and it helps on
takedowns. My size is a deﬁnite
disadvantage on riding. It’s hard
for me to reach for an arm and
a leg and to hold on.”

Although Rich has had several
home towns because his father is
in the Air Force and always mov-
ing, he has wanted to come here
ever since ninth grade. His coach
was a captain here during the
wrestlers’ big era, and Rich says,
“I always wanted a scholarship
to Pitt. ” His senior year he sent
films to then coach Rex Peery
and waited for his offer. Now
that he’s here, he’s here for more
than wrestling.

“I like to do my job because
they’re paying my way through

RICH SHILDT
Tough on Takedowns

school, but I think my studies are
just as important. You have to
look for a balance.” Apparently
Sl1ildt’s found it because he’s got
a 3.4 in biology. And his own
studies aren’t all he cares about.
“Pitt will have to look for a
good wrestler, but one who’ll stay
in. You can’t just hope he’ll stay
in.” He went on to cite Jack
Williams as one example of a
wrestler who eouldn’t make it.
Shildt has made it so far. The
Easterns are coming up in two
weeks and chances are he’ll fool
some of the spectators in Penn’s
Palestra. They may scoff at his

‘size like Penn State ‘did, but once

he starts wrestling they’ll real-
ize that the library isn’t the only
place where he belongs.

It’s been 12 years and 21
games since Carnegie Tech
defeated the Panthers in bas-
ketball. The Tartans, as al-

ways, are convinced that this
time the jinx will be broken.

They get their chance tomorrow

night at tiny Skibo gym.

Fordham’s coach John Bach ob-
served when he was here that he
preferred to play teams tougher
than his own, rather than weak-
er clubs which had local incen-
tive to win. The cagers have
played the better teams and lost,
and thus could salvage some
pride if they beat Tech tomor-
row.

_The two teams met the ﬁrst
night of the season, with the Pan-
thers leading all the way to win,
69-58. Jim LaValley had his best
game of the year, scoring 26
points and pulling down 20 re-
bounds. LaValley usually makes
it-~a habit of playing well against
Tech because ‘of their smaller
ballplayers.

None of the Tartans are over
6-4, yet despite this, Tech is 12-
10 for the year. They are led by
forwards Jeff Kalin and Mark
Lang. Kalin averages 15.7 points
a game and sophomore Lang nets
15.1. Lang showed a. ﬁne outside
shot in the ﬁrst contest between
the two clubs, hitting for 16
points.

Ray Burdett and Leigh Del-luff
comprise the Tartan backcourt.

  Delts, Pikas

Capture Mat
IFC Crowns

by AM ROSENGARTEN
One hundred and six mat-
ches highlighted the inter-
fraternity wrestling tourna-
ment during the past two
weeks. Delta Tau Delta cap-

tured the overall championship"

as well as the league “A” title,
and Pi Kappa Alpha pinned down
the “B” crown. -

The Delts scored most of their
points in the heavyweight and
160-pound weight classes. The
only championship they gained
was in the heavyweight where
Bob Burns and Brad Hildt reach-
ed the ﬁnals. The Pikas scored all
their points in the 120 through
150 weight classes. Barry Lieber-
man and Dick Rotter won crowns
at 120 and 130, respectively. This
was the third time that Rotter
had won the IF 130-pound title.

In the other divisions, Barry
Buchanan took the 140-pound
title for the second year in a row
for Theta Chi. Phi Ep’s only title
winner was Jack Heinowitz in
the 150-pound division. Pete J ack-
obson won the 160-pound title on
a—.close 1-0 decision for Sigma Chi.

In the upper weight classes,
Pi Lambda Phi capped the 170
and 180 classes, with Chuck
Green and Bill Siegal taking
those titles. SAE’s All Demase
eased into the 190 title on a for-
feit.

The top three fraternities ‘in
“A” league were Delta Tau Del-
ta, Sigma Chi, and Phi Epsilon
Pi. The ﬁrst three spots in league
“B” were ﬁlled by Pi Kappa Al-
pha, Theta Chi, and Sigma A1-
pha Epsilon. .

The dual—meet between the fra-
ternities and the dormitories for
the wrestling championship of
their division will take. place in
the wrestling room at the Field
House March 7 at 7 pm.

Since 'tomorrow’s game marks
the end of the season for Tech,
it will be the last chance for Tar-
tan fans to see 5-11 center Don
Keefer; play. Keefer graduates
this year after making a career
of outjumping opposing centers
at the tip-offs. LaValley has been
a frequent victim of a Keefer
leap. ‘ '
The Panther center, however,

has remained the cagers’ top
scorer since the opening game
against Tech. LaValley currently
is averaging 12 points a game.
Ken Bollensp and Stan Falenski
both contribute a little better
than 10. n
Much of the Panther problem

lies in the total statistics. They ‘

h.ave scored only 63.4 points a
game and have allowed the op-
position 77.6. The 14 point spread
and a shooting percentage of 37
per cent explains their 5-18 rec-
ord as well as anything can.

Frosh Cagers Humble

Duquesne, Face Tech  

].V’s Tomorow Night

   
 

PAUL NAPONICK and Rob MacFarla.n'd appear to be having a brief

discussion concerning which one should score this basket. Duquesme’s
F Cecil Banks was left completely out of the discussion.

by MIKE BROURMAN
Avenging an earlier defeat, the freshman cagers down-
ed the Duquesne frosh 83-73, Monday afternoon at the Field

House.

The victory leaves, the Cubs with an 11-4 mark to take

8 into their Thursday night game at Carnegie Tech with the

Tech J .V.’s. The frosh trounced Tech by an 87-49 count in

their season opener.

For 10 minutes on Monday it
looked like neither team wanted
to win. After this time the score

stood 10-8 in favor of the Little’

Dukes. But both teams soon woke
up and thrilled the spectators
with some ﬁne play. ‘

Duquesne woke up ﬁrst, and
for a while it looked as though
they would repeat their earlier
95-59 romp. Behind the shooting
of Bill Zopf and Cecil Banks they
opened up a. 30-20 advantage with
five minutes left.‘

But those ﬁve minutes, and the
rest of the game, belonged to the
Cubs. Paul Naponick tipped in a
missed foul shot, converted‘ a
foul, and scored two more buck-
etc to lead the rally.

The Little Dukes still lead, 38-
37, at the half, but as Rob Mc-
Farland, who lead the frosh with
26 points, said, “I knew at the
half that we had them.”

In the second half, according
to frosh coach Tim Grgurich,
"We ﬁnally worked the ball
around. It was the ﬁrst time we’ve
played up to our potential in a.
long time.

Trailing 48-45, Mc_Far1andcon-
nected on four buckets and

Charlie Hunt hit three foul shots V

to propel the Cubs into a 57-52

‘ lead which they never lost.

Duquesne narrowed the gap to

57-55 but baskets by Mike Patch-

\_g .

er, Rick Waggoner, Bob Brick-
ner, and Bob P_etrini allowed the
frosh to open up a commanding
70-57 edge with four minutes re-
maining.

The Little Dukes threatened

once, closing the gap to nine, but -

a. jumper by Naponick, a drive
by McFarland, and a pair of free
throws by P-etrini kept the Cubs
in command.

Then in the ﬁnal minute Mc-
Farland scored on two driving
layups to put the icing on the
cake. Duquesne scored three buck-
ets in the ﬁnal seconds to make
the score seem closer than it real-
ly was.

Grgurich summed up the game
by saying, “We wanted it more,
and that was it. The boys did a
great job out there.”

Besides the 26 scored by Mc-
Farland, the Cubs were lead by
Naponick with 15 points and
B1-ickner with 11. Naponick led
all rebounders with 11 and Mc-
Farland was next, grabbing 10.

by ANDY SWARTZ

The gymnastics squad end-
ed its worst season in his-
tory last weekend, being
crushed by Temple on Fri-
day night and Penn State on
Saturday night. The gymnasts
were never even close against
Penn State as Dave Shidemantle
was not able to participate due
to a muscle strain that developed
in the Temple meet.

State completely overwhelmed
the gymnasts, winning 186-132,
one of the worst defeats ever
suffered by the gymnasts. For
those of you who don’t follow
gymnastics this could be com-
pared to the football team losing
to Notre Dame, 69-7.

With a crowd of over 5,000 be-
hind them, the Nittany Lions
were at their best, leading all
the way. Led by their All-Ameri-
can, Steve Cohen, who captured
ﬁrsts on the side horse, on the
horizontal bars, and on the paral-
lel bars, the gymnasts trailed by
40 points after four events. In
fact, not one gymnast ﬁnished in
the top three positions in any of
the ﬁrst four events.

The second half wasn’t much
better although Sacco managed
to salvage thirds on the parallel
bars and still rings and Bob Dod-
son took a third on the long
horse vault.

The undermanned gymnasts
without the services of their best
performer, Shidemantle, just
couldn’t come through in any
event and closed the season with
a 2-9 record and 0-7 in Eastern
competition.

Friday's meet wasn’t much bet-
ter as the gymnasts lost to Tem-
ple 178-152. Shidemantle took his

  Appointed

Line Coach

by GEORGE LIES
Assistant Sports Editor
Dave Hart is all set to
dirty his hands once again.
Spring football begins next
Monday and the head coach
would like to sidestep two
problems which plagued the Pan-

thers last Spring. It doesn’t ap-.

pear likely.

Poor weather conditions and
the loss of two assistant coaches
may force Hart to delay the
opening of drills at least a week.

An extremely rainy period spoil-
ed Hart’s ﬁrst Spring practice. It
looks like snow will be the spoil-
er this year.

Installation of a new system
and a. new staff was another prob-
lem which slowed down the prog-
ress last Spring. Hart hoped to
avoid these complications.

But the departure of lineback-
er coach Dick Bestwick to Geor-
gia Tech and offensive backﬁeld
coach Lee Bennett to Cincinnati
forced Hart to alter his plans.
Howard Weyers, the head offen-
sive coach at Columbia in 1966,
replaced Bestwick. Presently,
Hart is interviewing several other
coaches about the offensive back-
ﬁeld post. An announcement is
expected this week on the sec-
ond coach.

Weyers, formerly of New Ken-
sington, Pa., reports to Hart to-
day. A three sport man at Green-
ville High, he was a four year
letterman at center at Theil Col-
lege from 1952 to 1956.

He coached in the Ohio schol-
astic ranks at East Palestine High
and Maple Heights. From 1958 to
1964, he compiled a 45-14-2 ree-
ord.

He was the main factor in C01-

umbia’s jump from last to sec-
ond in total offense in the Ivy
League within two years.

“Howard has come up through
the ranks and has a wide range
of football background and know-
ledge,” said Hart who has known
Weyers for 12 years.

“I’ve had nothing but the high-
est recommendations on him,”
Hart pointed out. “He’ll do the
kind of job we need to win on
our level of competition at Pitt.”

Once the Panthers do open
practice, they will have 36 days
to get in 20 sessions under NCAA
regulations. Hart plans to ﬁnish
Spring drills before the startvof
ﬁnal examinations April 12. The
annual Blue and White Spring
game is scheduled for April 18.

“During the ﬁrst ten days of
drills, I plan to use everybody
two ways,” Hart said. “With the
exception of a few players, the
staff will then settle down to one
set lineup, one player per posi-
tion.

Hart still lives with the mem-

. ory of his ﬁrst coaching year. It

being the worst in the school’s
history. His main objective will
be to plug a defense which al-
lowed its opponents an average
of 211 yards net rushing and 135
yards passing a game. Panther
opposition also averaged just un-
der 33 points per game.

Martin Swims ‘Fly’

by JAY KAPLAN
The step from swimming in high school to going to the
Easterns is a big one, and after four years, Gary MartTn

will ﬁnally have his chance.

Martin, a senior, is co-captain of a swimming team that
has had its share of disappointments. He has been one of
the bright spots for Coach Jerry Snyder but still the season
has to be somewhat of a disappointment to Martin.

For three years Martin swam in the butterfly for the

Sutherland

Leads Dorms

..by DAVE SHEAR

With only swimming and
track left on this year’s dorm
intramural schedule, Suther-
land House has all but wrap-
ped u_p the over—all sports
championship. '

Sutherland, by winning foot-
ball and wrestling, and taking
second in softball and volleyball,
has accumulated over 300 points
toward the total athletic trophy.
The “Jocks,” under the leader-
ship of Reid Eikner and Steve
Solnoki, still have a chance ‘to
win the basketball championship.
“The secret to the house’s win-
ning formula is team work,” said
Eikner.

The only team With, a chance
of catching Sutherland is Key-
stone House. Though they have
not won any team championships,
they have never been entirely
eliminated from placing among
the top positions, therefore, they
have totaled over 200 points.

Random House, by winning
softball; Hawthorne, due to its
Volleyball victory,-the House of
Lords; Mad House; Pleasure Pa-
lace; and Panther House all have
totaled around 125 points, and
each have a chance for third.

The statement by Eikner about
his team’s desire and team work
is just a part of Sutherland’s
“magic formula.” The real rea-
son is participation.

_ Mermen. In high school he was an All-American in the event

and held the New York State
record for the butterﬂy. But this
year, he made the “ultimate”
sacriﬁce for the team. He switch-
ed completely to the freestyle
sprints.

Martin rsimply took the change-
over in stride “because the team
had a butterﬂier, Howie Norris,
and needed someone to ﬁll in the
sprints,” he said.

After swimming in the 50 yard
freestyle ‘event all year, Martin
will be a deﬁnite disadvantage
in the Easterns. “I’ll be swim-
ming the butterﬂy,” said Martin,
“against some really fast boys.”
To get into form, he has been
“concentrating on the butterﬂy
in practice for the last Wee .”

According to Martin, “the 100
yard butterﬂy in the Easterns is
considered a sprint.” He hasbased

. his training program on this fac-

tor. “I’ve been doing a lot of
‘repeats’ butterﬂy sprints,” said
Martin, “which consist of repeti-
tion of 50 to 100 yard butterﬂy
sprints.” R

Nevertheless, Martin feels there
will be a change itn the attitizde
toward swimming. With the hir-
ing of Bill Grant as the new

 
 

 
  
   
  
    
   
   
     
    
      
     
   
     
 
   
    
  
   
  
 
  
  
   
  
  
 
 
  
 
   
   
   
  
 
  

Tracksters 
Cop 2nd in
Invitational

by DAN LICHTENSTEIN

The track team has proved
the old cliche, “It’s never too
late.” After four frustrating
losses and an easy victory in
dual meet competition, the
tracksters ﬁnally showed their
potential as they ﬁnished second
to William and Mary in a 12 team
meet at Delaware last Saturday.

The Colonials edged the run-
ners, 47-40, but more important
were the individual perform-
ances of Jim Banner’s athletes.
As usual, several records were
tied or broken.

,.In the meet with Army here,
junior Paul Greig broke a 28 year
old two mile record with a 9:23.
Saturday, Greig chopped ﬁve
more seconds off the mark.

Doug Doben has had an un-
spectacular season running be-
hind Chet Wojceichowski in the
sprints. Wojeichowski didn’t make
the ﬁnals this past weekend, but
in a Cinderella type ﬁnish, Do-
ben won the event tying the
school record of 6.3 seconds for
the 60 yard dash.

Sophomore Greg Ellis continues
to improve as he has now more
than made up for the loss of Jim
Flannigan in the shot put event.
Ellis won on Saturday with a
new 52’7” record.

All the rest spells success. Frank
Handelman and Roger Holly took
one, two in the 1,000 yard run
as did Jack Neyer and King Da-
vis in the,600. Tom_Christie and
Dave Brinn ﬁnished second and
fourth ‘in the hurdles; Ken Law-

Misfits, MBA Capture

Independent Crowns    
- by JERRY GRUEBEL ‘-
The Misfits of League “A” and the MBA of League .“B_f’ .

are the champions of this year’s Independent Intramuralif
League. Both teams finished the season undefeated in:

eight games.

The Misﬁts clinched ﬁrst place
in League “A” when they hand-
ed the Young Bulls their ﬁrst loss
oi the season, 48-45. Trailing, 24-
28, at half-time, the Misﬁts came
back strong in the second half
behind Jim.Jaﬂ:'e (16 points) and
AI Zortea (10 points). '

Team balance has been the
pattern of play that the Misﬁts
followed all season. Each game,
threor four players score in the
double ﬁgures.

_ The Young Bulls (4-1) ﬁnished
in second place in the “A”

-

League. They won four lopsidedf;
games until being defeated by the S
Misﬁts. Frank Gustine, George ;
M-edich, and Chuck Winters have 
been the big guns in the Young"
Bulls attack. 7

The big game in League “B”.-. ‘_
was in the middle of the season
when the MBA downed the Nads, 
60-43. That game decided first
place since itwas the only loss A‘
that the Nads suffered all season ’

The MBA has been led by ‘lom

I Dear Mr. Byman:

There is one basic fact of economic life which
I haven't yet discussed in any depth, though it

~ has come up in many student letters to me.

This is profit.

Students think about ”profit" when they consider
business as a career or as a social force. A
student who shuns a business career because he
feels ”there is more to life than making money”
may also be one who thinks ”businessmen will
do anything to make a profit” or ”business

gets profits at so.meone’s expense.”

The overwhelming majority of American
businessmen today would agree enthusiastically
with this student's first statement. They would ’
reject emphatically the others.

‘lust what is profit?

First of all, business does not do things in order to
make a profit; business makes a profit in order to
do things. I will illustrate this with some Motorola
facts and then refer to the view of a college
professor who also has served the government.

Motorola,’s 1965 net profit amounted to just over '
6°/o of our sales. Because we made a profit, we
were able to put $11.4 million into our employees’
profit-sharing fund and pay Federal income taxes
of $26 million. We retained $26’ million to

reinvest in our future growth.

The funds a company needs to fill growing *
consumer demand come, in the last analysis, from
retained earnings and from depreciation.
(Depreciation is the cost of buildings or equipment
wearing out; each year, we charge against income
part of the original cost and thus ultimately recover
it.) Our 1965 depreciation was $10 million.

So, to pay for the expansion needed to fill 1965's

‘increased demand for our products, we had $26
million of retained earnings plus $10 million in
depreciation—a total of $36 million. Buying new
tools, equipment, and plants during 1965 took
$25 million. We also needed $20 million in

- ”working capital” to finance larger inventories,

carry increased accounts receivable, and meet
greater payrolls. $45 million was needed; $36
million was available. The $9 million difference
came from earningspreviously retained
forjust such a use.

Motorola manufactures radios, television sets,
record players, semiconductor products, industrial
_and hospital communications systems, military and

automotive electronics hardware, electronic control '

systems, space equipment and some other things.

0 We started with only a car radio. Without profit,

we could not have expanded or diversified into

all these other |ines—and the demand for these
products showed the need for them. Profits cannot
do the whole job here, but making a profit does
qualify you to borrow funds to grow on. We

have done this several times. And because we
were profitable we sold additional

common stock several times.

Here are earnings reports of some other
companies, each of whose 1966 profits set new

records: Bethlehem Steel, Standard Oil (Indiana),

Sinclair Oil, and Westinghouse Electric. Their
earnin.gs,,as a per cent of sales, ran 6‘.4°/o, 6.7°/o,
6.7°/o, and 4.6°/o respectively. If you were selling

on commission, would you think these _
percentages were too high? Could these companies

.continue to serve their customers without the

retained profits to finance new plants
and for working capital?

Motorola isowned by shareholders who advanced
their money and share the risks. To them, during
1965, we paid $6 million in dividends—less than
1°/o of the year_—end market value of their stock.
Does this rate seem excessive? The employees’
profit-sharing plan received nearly

double this amount. '

‘ Profit has been a catalyst in an economy which

has raised the per capita share of the gross
national product 42°/o in your lifetime (to $3110)
and has prospects of doubling this figure by

the year 2000 (both in constant 1958 dollars).

‘Average corporatelprofits,'for companies in all

industries, companies having good years and bad,
are only 3.3% of sales (Dept. of Commerce '
figures). Might it not be more of a wonder that

this major job got done with such a proportionately
minor catalys_t than a dismay over high profits?

In his recent book, Economic Myth and Reality,
Professor Delbert A. Snider, chairman of the
Department of Economics at Miami University,
Oxford, Ohio, examines the myth that: ”Profits
are an unearned and unnecessary ‘grab’ on the '
public’s purse.” The reality, he concludes, is that:
”Profits are anessential part of our economic

  

system, guiding the use of resources and providing
the base for increases in the standard of living.
The best safeguard against excessive

profit is competition.”

Professor Snider sees profits as reward for
risk-taking, innovation, and the organizing of
production. Profits encourage business "'to be as
economical and efficient as possible in the use

of society's productive resources" (material and
human). Profits are also ”extremely. important as a
signal device informing business of the kinds

of products the public desires.”

New developments in every field of endeavor are
funded from profits. Many schools and universities
are sustained substantially by the abilityofrbusiness
to make a profit. Just over half of most corporate
profits are paid to the Federal government in
income tax alone; whatever government agencies
orprograms you consider excellent are able to
function only because the country's economic
system produces wages and profits to be taxed.

Like every tool of_man since fire, profit can be
misused. In the developing history of mankind,
however, no economic system has yet been
devised that brings as much benefit to as many
people asours does. Our challenge is to minimize
the misuse and maximize the benefits.

Making a profit should be neither the primary
reason a business exists nor the primary reason a
businessman works. Profits are not the purpose
of a business but profits must be earned if the
business is to continue to serve the needs of
‘society. And that is its pu'rpose.
