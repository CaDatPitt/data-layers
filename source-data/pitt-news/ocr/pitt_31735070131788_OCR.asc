One of America’s greatest student newspapers — since 906

A VOLUME XCVIII, NUMBER 117

Union becoming
Pitt’s own Camelot

ADAM FLEMING
Staff Writer

Who needs Druids when there are
the Kennedys? V

Pitt’s mysterious secret society
recently took a backseat in conspiracy
speculation to a more public Student

Government Board dynasty-in-the- ,

making. .

The last four SGB presidents were
all former businessmanagers, appoint-
ed by previous presidents, forming a
chain of seemingly hand—selected suc-
cessors. ' _- '

“I understand that’s the way it has
become,” said Jeff Alex, a former
Board president and inadvertent found-

ing father of the dynasty. “It was never

intended to be that way.” _

‘ In 2000, then—president Mike
Unangst appointed Alex as business
manager. A

After" Alex won the election in
2001, he appointed Kevin Washo, Jr.,
as his Board’s business manager.

, When eWasho became SGB’s 2002-
2003 president, he appointed Liz
Culliton as the business manager.

Culltion went on to win the follow-
ing presidential election and to appoint
Brian Kelly, who Won his presidential
election in the fall semester.

After taking office this semester,
President Kelly appointed Board mem-
ber Liz Blasi as business manager.

But he said the decision had noth-

' ing to do with preserving a trend.

“When deciding who to make’ busi-
ness manager, the prospect of who
would be the next president‘ never
crossed my mind,” Kelly said.

Although informal, and by no

’ one’s account a permanent ﬁxture of

Pitt_ politics, not everyone is enamored
with the Camelot of the William Pitt
Union.

_ “I think that all of that is beside the ‘
point,” said Andrea DeChellis, who-

was a Board member during Washo’s
term and lost‘ to Culliton in the spring
of 2003 election. “People don’t feel
connected to SGB.’V’

DeChellis, focusing more on the
actions of the Board once elected than
the election process, warned that SGB
is injuring itself through infighting.

“Decisions aren’t being made by
SGB,” DeChellis said. “They’re being
made by the Chancellor and the Vice
Proyost.” .

DeChellis accused past boards of
focusing too heavily on slates.

But Washo, a self-excised prince of
Pitt, saw otherwise. '

.“It takes a lot to win an election,”
he said. “It’s not like something that’s
just handed and given.”

Washo cited Culliton’s vote-getting
ability and experience on the Board as
more probable explanations of her
ascent to the presidency than any
dynastic inﬂuence of his own.

“I don’t think it’s anything seri-
ous,” Washo said. “I think people are
reading Way too much into it.”,

Alex added that although he’d

always entertained the notion of toss--

ing his hat in the ring, if Unangst had
run for another term, he probably
would not have run.

Former Board member Jesse

A Horstmann, who ran against Kelly for

president, said he understood the trend

but felt that changein the process was

necessary. . »
“The business._manager is always
going to be in a strong position,”.

Horstmann said, before taking issue

with the process of business. manager
selection and its implicit connection
with elections. '
' After a president is elected to the
Board, he or she appoints a business
manager. V
The Board then must approve that

Diabetes grant to educate

KATIE LEONARD
Assistant News Editor

People living in rural areas or Allegheny
County, and U.S. Air Force veterans are all
among the possible beneﬁciaries of a new
$10 million grant ‘

On Friday, Congressman John Murtha
announced the appropriation of the funding
to Pitt’s Diabetes Institute.

According to Jane Dufﬁeld, UPMC’s
news bureau director, Western Pennsylvania
has a higher—tl1an—norn1al diabetes average.

In the entire state, there are about 1.1
million people with diabetes. And annually,
11,500 Pennsylvanians die from the disease.
Diabetes the leading cause of new blind-
ness cases, end-stageirenal disease and non-
traumatic amputations in Pennsylvania,

' according to a UPMC press release.

The newly-allocated money will go
toward increasing diabetes education.
Duﬂield said thata lot of research has gone

into learning how to take care of diabetes
patients; however, that infonnation has not
funneled its way into inany clinic_s and.p1i—
mary care doctors’ oﬂices. In particular, bec-
ple living in rural areas are left without
health care or information regarding diabet-

. ic care.

“The main focus is to take that knowl-
edge and make it more accessible,” Duﬂield
said. Dufﬁeld added that the rate of diabetes
among Air Force veterans and their families
is considerably higher than the average. By
increasing education, the program will help
teach such high—1isk groupshow to prevent
the disease and how to take care of them-
selves once contracting it.

Currently, UPMC works with the Air
Force through its telemedicine programs.
These programs allow information -to be
kept in computerized databases, which help
with medical education, the transfening of
medical records and allowing distant doctors A
to consult on various surgeries, she said.

Horstmann said presidents are
prone to select the people they ran with
or are friends with. '

“It’s not a perfect system,” he said.
“I think that changes need to be made
in general, [and] it needs to be done
outside of elections. People get too
closely tied into elections.”

As for Blasi’s View on next year’s
ballot:

“To be honest, I am concentrating
completely on this year and doingthe
best and most I can for SGB,” she said.
“I really want to see how this year
turns out before I make any future
decisions.”

Vatican approves new scientific study

The Catholic Church has aclmowledged

that not every problem canbe solved by I

prayer and prayer alone.

According to the Catholic News
Service, the Vatican released a 220-page
report, “Sexual Abuse in the Catholic
Church: Scientiﬁc and Legal Perspectives.”
The report examines research into the psy-
chological causes and types of abuse; screen-
ing procedures; recidivism rates; effects on
child victims and the possibility of success-
ful therapy for abusers.

Edited by eight non—Catholic scientists
specializing in the study or treatment of sex-
ual abuse, the report ﬁnds fault with and
challenges the American bishops’ zero-toler-
ance policy of seeking to remove from min-
istry any Roman Catholic priest who has
abused a child.

According to the scientists, the zero—tol-
erance policy effectively passes the responsi-
bility for an abusive priest out of the hands of
the Church and on to the larger society -
where there is less monitoring and supervi-
sion of his behavior.

This point should not be forgotten: They
are their brothers’ keepers.

Not only should the Church look to

properly punish and effectively treat what‘

the report terms “priest—abusers,’ ’ but the sex-
ual climate of seminaries should be reviewed
and reformed There should be better moni-
toring and consistent checking of local
parishes. Issues such as clerical rnaniage
need to be assessed with a greater reliance on
practical knowledge and scientiﬁc evidence

rather than outdated traditions. '

That the Vatican supported this report
was highly unusual, given the report’s
unﬂinching examination of the clinical
aspects of sexual abuse within the Church.
Pedophilia is still a psychological disease,
and it carmot be treated with prayer or isola-
tion from children.

With priests, the psychological ﬂaw is
an indication of spiritual decay as well. The
Church and its community should hold
priest-abusers accountable, but not without
the punishment and rehabilitation offered to
all sex offenders. The rehabilitation of priest-
abusers was a key issue in the report
Whereas the Americanbishops’ zero-toler-
ance policy seemed to ostracize offenders,

the experts argue that the priests need the A

Church to help them develop better self-con-
trol. 1

Far too often priests, seen as the strong-
holds of their parishes, do not receive the
healing they need ﬁom ﬂie Church. In the
past, the Vatican has appeared to hide the fal-
libility of its priests, but now it has the chance
to prove the real power of the Church and

faith as parts of reformation in individuals .

and in society.
Yes, the priests should and are being

punished for their heinous abuse of their

young‘ followers, but even science says they
should not be ostracized. Maybe now that
science agrees that we ought to take care of
each other, we will start to do it The Bible
and Jerry Springer have been saying it for
years. '

Another week of not-so-challenging rock

" McCartney used back in the Inid—‘60s.

The third semi—ﬁnal round of the Graﬁiti Rock
Challenge saw a remm to the usual four-band lineup. But
the quantity didn’t translate into a whole lot of quality.

First up was Further Down, a ﬁve piece that brought
along a decent-sized fan base that chanted them onto the

stage. Once they got started, though, it was tough to ﬁgure C

out what exactly was so great about them. ‘

With a sound that ﬂuctuated between latter—day Bon
Jovi and a lighter version of Stone Temple Pilots, Further
Down brought little  to their set. The
songs “Hypnotic” and ‘fDisillusioned” showed off
the lead singer’s almost-Weiland style, while his
between-song banter with the audience bordered on_
Fred Durst territory. _

The musicianship was excellent, with awesome guitar
work and drumming. But the lead singer’s constant crouch--
ing on stage, either in the center of it or in front of the audi-

ence —— to show how emotional his music was making him i

— became real annoying, real fast. These Tiger Beat poses
didn’t score the band a lot of points. But with the combina-
tion of his Mark McGrath look and his band’s every-other-

. band sound, Further Down could go places.

Second on the bill was the four piece Bad Karma This
group was a distinctly different band fromthe one before it
— and indeed, many other bands in the competition — in
that they were a group of older musicians. The bassist, in
fact, had a bass that looked a lot like the one Pa11l

rock ‘n’ roll vibe with a country twang in the
vocals. There were even a cou-
ple instances, like in the last

song of their set, where
they sounded

Isaak and his band.
I While they
were enjoyable to listen to,

they were average in nearly
a every way. Their musicianship
and lyrics were fairly by the numbers .— after a while, the
songs sounded similar to one another, with the only differ-
ence being the tempo of the guitar playing. They were also

Bad Karma can explain week three

what out of place in a “rock challenge” -
well and conﬁdently.

The ﬁnal band of the night was
Underneath It All. A ﬁve-piece group that
played a sort of punk-inﬂuenced angst-
metal, UIA —- as their fans affectionately
chanted — was deﬁnitely the most ener-
getic band of this round. They boasted
impressive guitar playing that thrashed the
stage and the audience, both with their hard
metal licks and with the guitarists’ jumping
around. i A

But it was the lead singer’s crazy
screaming and jumping off the drum riser

that encapsulated UIA’s energy. After a
breather of water and telling the audience
how “f great” they and the other
bands were between songs, the lead singer
would get his band into another song quick-

 

ly, screaming and yelling and jumping to

get the crowd pumped up.

UIA had a large cheering section as
well, so they didn’t really need any encour-
aging. But they also made the exodus of the
crowd at Mr. Small’s after UlA’s ﬁrst song
all the more striking. Perhaps it was
because the beer ran out or UIA was just
too loud, but a good number of people left
early onin UIA’s set _— nevera good sign.
The band was good, but, obviously, not one

that appeals to everyone.

When all was said — or screamed —
and done, the Rockwells emerged as the
third round victors. They join Alisium and
Mark Scheer and the Discount Stars in the
ﬁnals. Next week is the last round of the
serni-ﬁnals, and it boasts a heavy—duty line-
up with the likes of Usual, Ford Thurston,
Legendary Hucklebucks and Good Brother
Earl.

If you still haven’t checked out one of
these semi-ﬁnal rounds, next week —
despite being your last chance -—-‘  give
you the most bang for your 10 bucks. ‘

The Pitt women’s basketball team

I had an opportunity to end its . losing

streak, but in the end the Notre Dame
Fighting Irish used the same formula
that Pitt used to come back against it.
Twice, the Panthers came back from
deﬁcits by forcing, turnovers. Pitt was
able to pressure Notre Dame into 15

_ turnovers in the game. Pitt forwards
LaToya Kincaid and Jennifer Brown led ‘

the Panthers with three turnovers apiece
while guard Stacy Moore came up with
two steals. a I ' '

. “Stacy Moore played an all-around
phenomenal game and I’ thought
Jennifer Brown played a great second
half,” Pitt head -coach Agnus Berenato
said. .

The Panthers’ defense appeared to

. be possessed during their comeback

attempt as they dove after balls‘ and put
relentless pressure on the Irish’s ball
handlers. Pitt trailed in the game 21-14
with just over nine minutes left in the
first half before steals by Moore and
Kincaid respectively ﬁnished off a 9-4
run that closed the gap to 25-23.

“They never lost their poise,” Notre
Dame head coach Muffet McGraw said.
.“We made a nice run to start the second
half and got up by double digits. They
just didn’t quit.” ~

A Notre Dame went back up by four
before Pitt was able to tie the game.
With 2:19 left in the " ﬁrst half, the
Panthers ﬁnally caught the Irish when
Kincaid nailed two. free throws to knot
the game at 32. Two more Kincaid foul
shots gave Pitt a brief 34-32 lead.

But an 8-2 run by the Irish gave
them a 40-37 lead at the half and,
according to Berenato, the momentum

V they would need to defeat Pitt. Jeneka

Joyce nailed two of her five three point-
ers of the game during the run to account
for six of Notre Dame’s eightpoints.

_ ‘ . “We’re bitterly disappointed in the
loss, [but] I think we lost the game in the
last minute of the first half,” Berenato

said. “We lost the game on the right and "

left elbows when they hit two threes,
and that was the ballgame.”

“I guess the’ defense just fell
asleep,” Joyce said. “I just hung out on
the wing and seemed to be open.”

The Irish appeared to have made
Berenato a prophet‘. as they came out in

the second half and opened on an 11-2
run. But like the first half, the Panthers
were again’ able to come back from a
large deﬁcit.

“I knew our team could recover
from that,” Berenato said. “I don’t know
that it was anything that Notre Dame
did. I think it was what we did not do.
We came out and we were like the
Pittsburgh of past.”

Down 50-37, Pitt ﬁnally got on the
scoreboard in the second half with two
more Kincaid free throws. Again, the
Panthers were able to pressure the Irish
into turnovers in order to chip away at
Notre Dame’s lead. _

Kincaid was able to come up with
two more steals and Brown along with
Moore also .came up with steals. Before
Pitt knew what had happened it had
gone on a 10-2 run to cut the lead to 57-
54.

“I thought they got a bunch of easy
layups in transition [They scored] 20
points off of our turnovers,” McGraw
said. “That was the key — we threw it
away and they went down and made a
layup. We made it very easy for them to

Pitt men win  
.Big‘East title

NATE BERGER

Maybe the Atlantic Coast Conference
should have been courting the Pitt men’s
swimming and diving team.

Pitt’s men earned its eighth consecu-
tive Big East title and 19th since 1983 at
' the Nassau County Aquatic Center in East
Meadow, N.Y. last weekend.

The Panthers ﬁnished the three-day
meet Saturday with 746 points, their most
in 12 years, and defeated second place
Notre Dame by 162 points.

“Going into today, the way things
were seeded, it looked as if Notre Dame
might be able to catch us,” said Pitt head
coach Chuck Knoles, who won his 11th
title with Pitt. “But our guys came out and
swam well in the dual-meet events that we
usually compete in and that was a huge
reason we blew things open.”

_ _ Pitt Senior Eric Limkemarm, who

won four Big East honors, including help-
ing Adam Webber, Tommy Bird, and
Darryl Washington to a ﬁrst place ﬁnish in
the 800-meter freestyle relay, began
Saturday night’s competition with his
fourth straight victory in the 1650-meter
ﬁeestyle with a time of 15:24.76. Junior
Harmes Kohnke ﬁnished third in the event
and received Big East honors with a time
of 15:38.41. . _

, - Limkemann joined former Panther
diver John Sharkey, who won the 1-meter
events in 1987, 1988, 1990 and 1991, as
the only Panthers to win the same event
four times.

Limkemarm also tied, Sharkey and
Richard James with his seventh career
individual Big East title.

Another Sharkey accomplishment

Nemtsanov became the ﬁrst non-Miami.
diving champion since Sharkey in 1991.

the game contlibuted to the loss, Panther
head coach Agnus Berenato thought the
game was lost in the ﬁnal minutes of the ﬁrst
half. -
“We lost the game when they hit those

threes,” Berenato said:
She was referring to the end of the ﬁrst

half ‘when the Panthers had a 35-32 lead.

over the Irish.

The Panthers’ defense then allowed
Joyce to hit two consecutive three-pointers.
She was wide open on bot11 plays and‘ her

0 shots were uncontested.

‘ “I guess [Pitt’s] defense just fell asleep,”
Joyce said.
. The two three—pointers allowed Notre

. Dame to cruise on to a 40-37 halftime lead.

Notre Dame took its momentum into the
second half as it went on ani11—2 run to start
the half, which gave the Irish a 14—point
lead. ‘

Pitt had three players in double-digit -

scoring. Forward LaToya Kincaid ﬁnished
with 24 points and six rebounds, but fouled
out with 4:56 left in the game.

“I thought [Kincaid] was really the dif-
ference in the game,” Notre Dame head
coach Mulfet McGraw said “We. had no
answer for her.”

Pitt was also hurt by the 23 personal
fouls it committed, allowing Notre Dame to
attempt 28 free throws. The Irish only hit 15
of the 28 shots, which allowed Pitt to hang
around until the end.

Freshman forward Jennifer Brown
came off the bench and scored 12 points,
while pulling down nine rebounds.

The Panthers’ have the week off and
will travel to Virginia Tech where they will
look to end their 10-gamelosing streak The

Notre Dame’s cushion would stay
manageable ‘for Pitt and following a
ﬁeld goal by Moore, the Panthers were
only down 67-65. Pitt guard Amy

point attempt, while being swarmed by
Irish defenders as time expired on the

Kunich’s three pointer gave Pitt the
lead with 2:18 left on the clock. But two
