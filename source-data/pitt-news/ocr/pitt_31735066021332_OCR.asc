Pitt Board of Trustees announces tuition increase

By Lou Grieco
News Editor

There will be a general tuition increase
of approximately 6.5 percent this year, Pitt
President Wesley Posvar announced
yesterday, as the Board of Trustees
approved the university’s $620 million

budget for 1990.

“This is a solid, healthy budget,” Posvar
said. “We are in extremely sound ﬁnancial

shape.”

For in-state, undergraduate students,
tuition will increase from 3.8-4.0 percent,
depending on the school. For graduate
students, professional students and out-
of-state undergraduates, tuition will
increase -from 5.76.7

with inﬂation.

percent. The

exception is the School of Medicine, where
there will be no increase from last year.
"Posvar said that the increases are in line

“Because of a $2.1 million grant from
the state, we can hold tuition down to a 4
percent increase in some cases,” Posvar
said. “This is the lowest increase in years,
and that is our autonomous decision.

“Even though our tuition is near $4,000
a year, it is still considerably less than most
private schools, and our reputation of

quality is still intact. Some refer to us as a

Detective war/e solves mystery  McKeesport

In the early _'darkness of a new
Chinese day on July 19, 1900, a
young marine stood guard on a
wall protecting a legation which
included the U.S. embassy.

Suddenly, the dark silence was
shattered by a gunshot The
Marine, Pvt. Harry Fisher, fell to
the ground, the victim of a sniper’s
bullet. His comrades rushed to

, his aid, but the bullet had smashed

through his right lung. Tenwa letter to .the McKeaport Daily

rninutes later he was dead.

Fisher, a resident of
McKeesport, Pa., was
posthumously awarded this
country’s highest military

decoration," the Congressional

Medal of Honor. His body was
returned home and buried at the
McKeesport and Versailles
Cemetery in a curiously u nmarked
grave. McKeesport’s only Medal
of Honor recipient soon fell victim
to time, as he became a forgotten
hero. if
It 4 I

In 1981, McKeesport resident
Wes Slusher became interested
in a book entitled America's
Medal ofHonorRecipients. One
night, while perusing the book,
he stumbled upon Fisher’s name.

Slusher, an Army veteran, says
he wondered “why this hero
didn’t have a plaque or any type
of memorial erected in
McKeesport.” Hungry for an

News, hoping to contact someone
who knew of Fisher. Months
passed, after his letter was
published, and Slusher received
no replies. It seemed that no one
had ever heard of Marine Pvt.
Harry Fisher.

Slusher, a bachelor and retired
steelworker with dark curly hair
and black-rirnrned bifocals, sits
cross—legged on the ﬂoor of his
apartment. . With an air of
effervescence, he explains how
he was able to erect a plaque in
Fisher’s memory in 1982, with
the help of his Moose lodge.

“When I was a kid and went to
movies, I never had a real hero.
I could have had this man [Fisher]
as my hero, if there [had] been a
statue or plaque in McKeesport
I was denied and cheated out of
a real hero.” said Slusher.

Still bothered by the air of
mystery surrounding Fisher,
Slusher nevertheless felt that he

had vindicated the wrong. The

story would have ended here, _

had it not been for a chance
event which occurred three years
later.

In 1985, Slusher read in a
newspaper that the Merchant
Marines had chosen names for
some newly built freighters.
Reading further, he discovered
that one of the ships was to be
christened the U.S.S. HanyF1'sber.
At the christening ceremony, U.S.
Representative Helen Bentley, R-
Md., had said, “Just think of the
sacrifices made over the years by
men like Pvt Harry Fisher so that
we can stand here and enjoy the
freedom.” Slusher reasoned that
if they named a ship after Fisher,
they must have more information
about his life.

Slusher sent a letter to the
Marine Corps and the National
Archives and received disturbing
responses. They had no records

legislation

By Milt Klopfer
Staff Writer

Recruiting members and
collecting signatures for a letter
urging President Bush to block
gun control legislation were the
goals of representatives of the
Panther Pistol and Rifle Club,

who were at the concourse booth
_ of the Student Union on Thu rsday.

Club president William Lester
hopes that the letter will
discourage Bush from signing
what Lester terms as “mass-
hysteria-induced legislation that
would unfairly restrict and/or ban
outright millions of legally-owned
ﬁrearms ill-defined as “assault
weapons.”

“We’re letting folks know how
we feel things should be done,”
said Lester. “It’s tragic. The right
to bear arms is as much a civil
right as women's rights and the
right to -vote.”

The legislation in question
includes various Congressional
bills aimed at restricting the
manufacture, sale and ownership
of semi-automatic weapons.
According to Lester, two bills
currently in the Senate and the
House of Representatives would
require semi-automatic wea pons
to be treated as fully automatic
weapons and subject to
provisions of the Firearms Control
Act 5

Fully automatic weapons differ
from semi-automatic weapons in
that they are capable of ﬁring
their entire load of ammunition
with one sustained trigger pull.
Semi-automatic weapons require
separate trigger pulls for each
shot ﬁred.

Approximately 16 people
signed the letter, and 10 signed
up to join the club.“Thene were
two classes of people who spoke
to us. Onewaswhollysupportive;
the other was looking for
information on the subjects we
were discussing,” said Lester.

The 40—member club is funded
by the student activities fund.
Members shoot both riﬂes and
pistols weekly at the Trees Hall
firing range. Members may use
their own ﬁrearms or one of the
22 university-owned weapons.

Bush is offended by negative portrayal of Quayle

WASHINGTON (AP)
President Bush said Tuesday he
was offended by Republican
advisers who portrayed Dan
Quayle as a campaign disaster
who had to be protected from his
own political ineptitude.

In a new book byJules Witcover
and Jacc Germond, several
consultants to last year's Bush-
Quayle election campaign depict
the vice presidential candidate as
a lightweight who was not ready
for the national political scene.

One of the “handlers” employed
by the Bush team to manage
Quayle’s campaign travels,Joseph
Canzeri, said the former Indiana
Senator was tough to work with
because he had a limited attention
span.

“If he doesn’t like it, he goes
away from it,” Canzeri is quoted
as saying in his book. “He was
like a kid. Ask him to turn off a
light, and by the time he gets to
the switch, he's forgotten what
he went for.”

The book also indicates that
James Lake, the former Reagan
campaign press secretary who
advised Quayle, was dismayed at
some of Quayle’s remarks on
television as controversy about
his Vietnam-era National Guard
service heightened.

Soviet miners

continue strike

MOSCOW (AP) —- Coal miners
feel the government is making
empty promises and will continue
an 8-day-old strike that has
hampered operations at scores of
Soviet factories, a spokesman for
Siberian miners said Tuesday.

The Soviet Union’s worst labor
trouble since the turmoil of the
1920s spread “like a chain
reaction” to two more mines in
the Donetsk Coal Basin in the
Ukraine, a strike leader said. The
official news agency Tass said 39
mines in the region were closed.

No new figures were available

on the total number of strikers in
Donetsk and Western Siberia’s
Kuznetsk Basin, the nation’s main
coal-producing regions, but
earlier reports put the figure at
more than 112,000.

Tass said the strike had affected
more than 160 coal, machinery,
electronics and light industrial
businesses in Western Siberia
alone and that lack of coal could
cause “a catastrophe” at steel and
power plants.

New technique

to aid research

PHILADELPHIA (AP)—A new
technique of transferring human
chromosomes to mice could help
researchers study such illnesses
as cancer andAlzheimer’s disease,
the head of a New Jersey bio-

 

pharmaceutical company said
Tuesday.

The procedure, developed by
professors Cecilia W. Lo andjean
Richa, involves injecting human
chromosome fragments into the
embryos of mice. The mice then,
theoretically, will have the human
genetic characteristics of the
chromosomes, enabling
researchers to use the mice in
experimenting with cures for
disease.

Super 7 jackpot
at $60 million

HARRISBURG (AP) — A $60
million jackpot for Wednesday’s
Super 7 drawing is arousing
excitement despite the traditional
summer sales doldrums and a
letdown from April’s record $1 15
million prize, officials said on
Tuesday.

Pennsylvania lottery officials
raised the upcoming Super 7
jackpot from $55 million to $60

million Monday as ticket sales
started to pick up around the
state.

Officials also expanded sales
hours for the first time in lottery
history, opening a half hour early
at 5:30 a.m. and closing four
hours late, at 11:50 p..m.

Lottery directorjames Scroggins
said $10.5 million of the Super 7
tickets had been sold as of
Monday night. By late Tuesday
afternoon, an additional $5.5
million had been sold at a rate of
125 tickets a second, he said.

Continued from page 1
of Fisher’s activities before his

_ enlistment or any information on
. what happened to his body after

it was returned to McKeesport.
This news became the impetus
for Slusher to take an almost
obsessive interest in unravelling
the mystery surrounding Fisher.
Searching through back issues of
the McKee.spon‘ Daily News, he
came upon a curious front— page
article. It read,"FranklinJ. Phillips’
body sent back for burial.” Upon
reading the article, Slusher
discovered that a Marine named
Phillips was killed in the same

- . place and on the same day as

Fisher. Baffled by this
coincidence, Slusher presented
his evidence and enlisted the
help of U.S. Representativejoseph
Gaydos, D-Pa. He also went to
the town cemetery and was

amazed to find that the records
recorded the burial of a Franklin
Phillips but no Harry Fisher.

Gaydos’ aid Cindy -Cavalucci
worked for three years with
Slusher on the case. They
discovered that Phillips had
enlisted in the Army and had
been dishonorably discharged as
a deserter. Records showed that
Fisher had enlisted in the Marines
approximately two months after
Phillips was discharged. Learning
this, Slusher sent a letter to the
the Pennsylvania Museum and
Historical Commission. Their
research ended the mystery.

I I '0!

Harry Fisher was Franklin J.
Phillips. Phillips had used the
alias of Fisher to enter the Marine
Corps after his dismissal from the
Army. During his tour, Phillips
caught malaria while serving in

Cuba during the Spanish-Ameri-
can War. Dissatisfied with the
care given to him, he went AWOL
and returned to McKeesport to
be treated. He later tried to rejoin
the army but was dishonorably
discharged as a deserter. After
working on a railroad for a few
months, Phillips decided to try to
enlist in the Marines under the
name of Harry Fisher.

He was accepted and sent to
the Philippines, where he was
wounded by hostile native
inhabitants during the Philippine
Insurrection. After recovering,
Phillips was shipped to China to
protect the U.S. and foreign
legations from a radical Chinese
group known as The Fists of the
Righteous Amity. There he was
later killed on duty, the last
American to die in the Boxer
Rebellion." V

“A grateful and mighty nation
promptly forgot Franklin Phillips, ”
says Slusher.

Further research in Marine
Corps records turned up letters
sent from a Sarah Means to the
Marines stating that Fisher’s real
name was Phillips. Means was
Phillips’ mother, and wanted to
right the identity problem. The
Marine commandant who
received Means’ letter, General
Heywood, was a relative of
Phillips’ commanding officer,
Captain Newt Hall, who had
recommended that Fisher get the
medal. Heywood blocked the
name change to protect the
reputation of Hall, which had
already been significantly

damaged from charges of

cowardice in the same battle.
The problem was compounded

when Means later agreed to sign

_.L

a form to receive her son’s medal.
She signed the military’s
document saying he was Harry
Fisher, while telling the Daily
Newsthat her son Franklin Phillips
had won the medal.

Slusher and Cavalucci’s next
step was to convince the Marine
Corps to issue a new medal in the
name of Phillips. After a long
battle with an uncooperative
Marine Corps, the Medal of Honor
was ﬁnally changed to Phillips’
name in August 1988, and the
Armyexpungedthedishonorable
discharge from his records. In
addition, a tombstone was placed
on the grave ofFranklinJ. Phillips
by the American Legion.

Slusher proudly says, “This is
the true story of a McKeesporter

who went from dishonor to‘

honon"

performances, 4 to 4.5 percent
increases would be awarded, with
some outstanding individuals
receiving more, and possibly
some receiving less if their
performances were not rated as
satisfactory by the department
heads and the deans.

There is also what Posvar called
the “phenomenon of the ﬂoat.”
The ﬂoat is money that is left over
from the allocating process when
a professor dies or leaves the
university before the end of the
fiscal year. This money will go to
the other faculty and staff
members, and is expected to be
0.5 to 1.0 percent, pushing

compensation up to a possible
7.5 percent.

“This is disappointing,” James
V. Cunningham, vice president
of the United Faculty, said after
the meeting. “Both we and the
University Senate asked for a 7.5
percent increase. The floater has
always been there; that’s nothing
new.

“We felt that [the increase] is
necessary for the university to be
competitive in research. There is
an increasing shortage in college
professors, especially in the
sciences. These people are finding
jobs that pay better.”

Cunningham said that it was
good that the administration is

setting a satisfactory rate for
compensation, because in the
past, the deans and the
department heads were given
compensation money and were
allowed to distribute it as they
pleased. If the rate is made
permanent, Cunningham said it

would be a “definite
improvement.”
Posvar said that the

compensation rates change each
year and could not comment on
whether or not the satisfactory
rate was permanent.

United Faculty, a teachers’
union, won a major battle when
part-time faculty won the right to
negotiate salaries with the

   

administration. Full- time
employees are continuing to try
to get that right, but the case is
still before the labor board.
Cunningham said that the
administration will not begin to
bargain with them until the case
is settled. Because the
administration currently considers
them “management,” they do not
have the right to negotiate their
salaries.

“If we become recognized as
employees, which we are, instead
of management, we would have
a legal right to sit down with the
administration and negotiate. We
would have input on the budget
then,” said Cunningham.

Posvar also blamed the state
government for the inability to
make budgetary decisions earlier.
He said that there was more
negotiation in Harrisburg than in
earlier years between Gov. Casey
and the state legislature about
funding to state—related schools.

“This is an unusual budget in
that it developed after months of
a long budgetary process,” he
said. “We were not able to make
assumptions or decisions about
costs last June. We_ had to wait
until last week to‘ make our
decisions.“

Because of this, staff salary
increases will be implemented in

September retroactive to July .1. »

However, members of the
Board of Trustees praised the
negotiation process. According
to board member D. Michael
Fisher, the budget “seems to have
worked out very well this year in
trying to get funding. It has
provided more money. I must
warn you that there are many
competing interests for that

Stiﬂing the arts in America

The National Endowment for the Arts has suffered
greatly in past years, trying to keep the arts in America
aﬂoat with limited funding and resources. The latest
financial crunch to which the organization has been

. subjected reeks even more pungently than the indiffer-

ence that the government has shown to the arts in past

years.

The House of Representatives voted last week to cut a
“symbolic” $45,000 from the NEA’s budget as a discipli-
nary measure, to punish the organization for funding
exhibits that the House found objectionable, according to
US. News and World Report. *

The exhibits in question are Andres Serrano’s crucifix
suspended in urine, and an exhibit by the late artist Robert
Mapplethorpe, which is described as “sado-masochistic”

and “homoerotic.” The House’s sensibilities were dis-

turbed, and thus the disciplinary action.
This is .the face of "artistic suppression at its most vile.
When the Constitution was written, the first and foremost

right granted therein was the right to free expression. The

president has seen fit to propose the ..“modification”
(which can also be read as “infringement”) of that right to

_ prevent “ﬂag desecration.” Now, the House has made a

vote to regulate its support of free artistic expression
based on its slavish devotion to a religious symbol and its
narrow-minded contempt for an alternative life style.
While certainly some, perhaps many, might find these
works offensive, the Constitution exists to safeguard one
American’s right to say something that another disagrees
with. And while the removal of funding is not active
censorship (the prohibition of the expression of those
points of view, or the display of those works of art), it is
ironic that a society based on freedom of expression

should be so intolerant of it.

The Flight of the Bumble

The B-2 Stealth bomber ﬂew its
maiden ﬂight on Monday. It was
a sight to behold: There is no
fuselage and no tail, nor any of
the familiar markings of a jet

, airplane. It is a single, black ﬂying

W111 .

 

if As the engines roared, every
Pentagon official took an ant-
acid:’ This bird, this single plane,
cost $23 billion. It is the most
controversial weapons system
ever built. And no one at the
Pentagon even knew if it could
ﬂy. _ '

The last time the Air Force tried
to ﬂy a plane of this design, the

experiment was a resounding:

2  Kiwi. '  

3-:7-_.~g,_~.,;,_;,-,.,;‘;i,,;_  :: s..

failure. The wing design makes
the plane very unstable. But this
time, with the aid of several bil-
lion dollars worth of computer
technology, the _B-2 ﬂew.

Now that Air’ Force has an-
swered the critics’ most serious
charge (that the plane would
never get off the ground), it is
seeking 132 more of these bomb-
ers at an estimated cost of $70
billion .

The House Armed Services

Committee has proposed a 17 -

percent reduction in next year's
expenditures for the project. Some
members of Congress are calling
for the complete elimination of
the B-2.

From the start, this plane has
been plagued by procurement
problems and technological set-

backs. According to CNN, the_

Some observations on American news

It was just another “month in
the life” of a country which had.
just marked her 213th year of
independence and freedom.

Joining the festivities were
Andrei Gromyko, former Soviet
foreign minister, gargoyle and
part—architect of the Afghan inva-
sion, and ex—Hungarian leader,
Janos Kadar. Both expired from
natural causes.

Laurence Olivier, actor, and
Herbert Von Karaian, conductor,
died in unrelated incidents.

O O O

The big news, of course, was
the twin bill mlings by the U.S.
Supreme Court. ‘As it turns out,
instead of clarifying the issues,
the eight old men, plus one,
muddled the abortion question,
leaving 250 million Americans up
in the air, at least until late fall.
when the next abortion case
comes to trial.

As for the other decision, bar-
ring nativity scenes, yet allowing
Menorahs surrounded by Kris
Kringles, I’d like to respond by
using an old quote from editor R.
Emmett Tyrrell, Jr. A

“Once again Americans cele-
brated [Christrnasl .'.. with rancor-
ous protests against nativity
scenes, though there were very,
few complaints against the ap-
palling presence of St. Nick, that
overweight throwback [to] by-

maiden voyage of the B-2 was
delayed for two days by a fuel-

— gauge-problem. Robert Costello,

formerly in charge of weapons
procurement at the Pentagon, said
that he had had quality control
problems during production.
Moreover, the Pentagon has

twice changed the Stealth

bomber’s primary mission. Ini-
tially, the B-2 was designed to
hunt mobile nuclear missiles
inside Soviet territory and neu-
tralize them. Air Force officials
subsequently argued that turning
on the B-25 radar to hunt for
mobile missiles would make it

visible to Soviet radar, a sitting .

duck.

The Pentagon downgraded the
B-2's primary mission to destroy-
ing targets that are too big or too
durable to be destroyed by cruise.

 

gone days who forces eight tiny
reindeer to pull him at breakneck
speed over rooftops, and in a

contraption bereft of seat belts, '

or air bags, or any other federally
prescribed safety feature whatso-
ever.” ‘

 

Tyrrell goes on but I think you
get the idea. .

0 Molly Yard, the frumpy, ever-
patient el presidente of the Na-
tional Organization for Women,
wasted no time calling in the
shock troops after learning of the
abortion decision. She promptly
spat, “This is war against women!”

What was it that Rudyard
Kipling said? Something like, “If
you can keep your head when all
about you are losing theirs 
then you’ll be a man,” Molly, are
you listening?

-Perhaps. Molly should have
pointed her guns elsewhere, like
at Japan. It seems that Japan's
agriculture minister claimed that
women are “useless in the world
of politics” and referred to the

female head of the Japanese-

Socialist Party as “an idiot.” All

thison that tiny little lslandshould  

keep enough melodrama alive to

missiles. Now the Pentagon ar-
gues that the B-2 can also be used
for conventional bombing mis-
sions. The prototype B-2 is de-
signed to carry 16 nuclear bombs
for this purpose.

But the B-52 is more reliable,
inexpensive and better suited for
such conventional bombing
missions. It can also carry nuclear
bombs.

Proponents argue that the new
stealth technology warrants the
price tag. The bomber is coated
with a radar-absorbing plastic,
and is shaped to reduce radar
visibility.

But the B-2 is not invulnerable.
First, it is not invisible to radar,
and once spotted,» it can be
tracked. Second, its big F-118
engines make the B-2 vulnerable

‘ With a paper bag full of
C . . . .
,drawings and a degree in pictorial
-design, Andy Warhol arrived in
:New York in 1949. His first
ocommercial artjob, at age 21, was
:to illustrate an article for Glamour
.magazine. The illustration, which
‘featured line drawings of ladders
:with fashionable shoes climbing
0the rungs, was to epitomize the
:“new” ’50s woman climbing the
oladder of success.

' The article was called “Success
sis a job in New York...” and it is
:from this that an exhibit cu rrently
.at the Carnegie takes its name.
: Warhol was born Andrew
.Warhola in Pittsburgh and
‘graduated from the Carnegie
,Institute of Technology. “Success
‘ is a job in New York. . . ”.- The Early
o .

,ArtandBusmess of/may Warhol
Ofeatu res some of Warhol’s earliest

, :work as a student in the late ’/10s

-and through his commercial
‘career.

Though he was a successful
commercial artist, Warhol is best
oremembered as a pop artist. It
:was his rendition of Campbell's
osoup cans and other works of
:pop art that made him a cultural
. icon. The "Success "exhibit sheds
:new light on the commercial art
.career thatserved as the backdrop
‘for his pop work.

, Featured in this exhibit are
‘excerpts from Warhol’s
zeornmercial art career which do
‘not necessarily stand on their
:own as works of art. They include
oadvertisements, posters, record
:covers and illustrations for
ochildren’s books and magazine
:articles done by Warhol as a
ocommercial artist, although
:commcrcialism is more
ocharacteristic of some of Warhol’s
:pop art (the soup cans, for
.example) than of the work he
:produced commercially.

. Warhol’s commerctial and pop
‘art were virtually intertwined for
:a few years during t.he early ’60s.
‘Because of the close relationship
:between these two facets of his
-work, an understanding of
:Warhol’s commercial art is
Oessential when trying to
‘understand his art as a whole.

The "Success "exhibit provides

a genuine sense of Warhol’s
commercial art and should be
‘experienced-by anyone seeking
021 greater understanding and
:appreciation of both the artist
.and his work.
: In 1955, as sole illustrator for I.
.Miller Shoes, Warhol gained a
‘reputation as a “shoe person." He
.capitalized on this notoriety in a
‘series of celebrity shoe portraits.
:Footwear made famous by
‘Warhol included Elvis Presley's
:boot and Zsa Zsa Gabor’s spiked
-heel. These shoe portraits alone
:are worthy of a trip to The
oCarnegie. (A similar selection is
:“Who’s Who in Holiday Hats.-”)

n One piece which does stand
0

on its own as a work of art is
“Tattooed Woman Holding Rose,”
featured in the exhibit. The
drawing depicts a Victorian image
of a woman tattooed with
commercial trademarks from the
19503.

Another interesting work is
“Strawberry jell—o,” a cardboard
stand-up with the directions for
making a packet of Jell-o printed
in a spiral around a Jel1—o mold.

The exhibit provides some
information about the formulative
years in Warhol’s life. To convey
a sense ofthe social climate during
Warhol’s early years as an artist,
the “Success” exhibit includes a
monitor displaying television
commercials that ran during the

1950's.

The exhibit also includes
information about the influence
of his mother and two of his
instructors (Robert Lepper and
Samuel Rosenberg) on Warhol’s
development as an artist.

Other works worth checking
out are “The Autobiography of a
Snake Called Roa the Boa,”
“Orchestra,” “Greta Garbo and
Robert Taylor in Camille” and “A
la Recherche du Shoe Perdue.” I
enjoyed the entire exhibit and
spentmostofan afternoon taking
it in.

Warhol had the ability to convey
the personality of the products
that he illustrated. The “Success”
exhibit demonstrates that skill
and provides some
autobiographical information as
well.

If you are interested in Warhol,

an afternoon at this exhibit would
be well spent. It 017915 an
entertaining and enlightening
portrait of Warhol as a
commercial artist.

The exhibit was organized by

The music of the future is here
today. Sonic Turmoil, a two—day
festival of experimental music
and performance art happening
in Wilkinsburg onjuly 21 and 22,
will provide a glimpse into the
world of the modern avant—garde.
The event is called Sonic Turmoil V
because it combines the artistic
efforts of the Sonic Temple, which
is hosting the national acts, and
the Turmoil Room gallery, which
features local talent.

The festival will begin on both
nights at 6 p.m. at the Turmoil
Room. On Friday, the ambient
tribalisms of Mt. Lebanon group
The Year Zero will follow the
industrial keyboard soundscapes
of Powder French and the tape-
loop artistry of Bannerday.

clanging of oxygen tanks and

glass, and a rush of distorted

vocals and scary bass rhythms.
Saturday’s lineup is no less
formidable. Philadelphia
experirnentalist John Hudak will
use the sounds of the environment
to create a disturbing mood. Then
the Tape Beatles, a tape

manipulation group from Iowa, .

will whip up a humorous package
of sound and film collages for
your enjoyment.

The summer extravaganza will
conclude with a performance
from renowned percussionist
Gregg Bendian, who has
collaborated with such luminaries
of the New York improv scene as
John Zorn and Jim Staley, and the
amazing Miracle‘ Room from
Austin, whose Arabic—industrial—
art—drone is comparable to Savage
Republic with a Southern twang.

In between the performances,
the audience can take in the
exhibit of correspondence art
from all over the world that will
be on display in the Sonic Temple
lobby, and visit their in-house

record store which carries a lot of g

experimental music unavailable

. anywhere else.

It has often been said‘/that

But if you listened to
Athletic Director Ed Bozik, you
might believe that everything is
hunky-dory in Steeltown. Bozik
told the Pittsbu rgb Post-Gazette,
“We’re not going to hell in a
handbasket academically.”

Apparently, all of these
student-athletes are enrolled in
The Route to Success for Propo-
sition 48 Athletes, as taught by
Brian Shorter. “A year with the
nose in the books and the body

reads. _

Shorter, the 6-6 power
forward who carried the basket-
ball team to a 17-13 record in
1988-89, is perhaps the" best
Proposition 48 student-athlete
ever. His academic standards rose
with his basketball abilities last
season.

But Shorter is the excep-
tion, not the rule. Perhaps his

influence will rub off on these
ineligible players. Then again,

Shorter has a better work ethic

than most athletes, and that is
innate, not learned. ' .

But Shorter has paid his
dues. The question at hand is the
recruitment of a fair number of
ineligible players. ‘Bozik’s ration-
ale works this way: If five Propo-

9 Funny, but I've never
known a student who scored
below a 700 on the SAT and was
still admitted to a major Division

"I school. But now that the cat is

out of the bag, imagine the thrill
of all those borderline collegians
who now have a chance to fur-
ther their Hi-Q abilities with a
college education, their SAT
scores notwithstanding.

Furthermore, Bozik, in a
moment of deductive reasoning,
said, “In many cases, I suspect
the marginal student-athletes
defer taking the standardized tests
until the last possible moment,
just to make sure they get a
scholarship, but I can’t prove
that.” ' .

35+ league begins

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

Colorado Springs, Colo. —- It seems that as people get older and
need a place in the sun and a more relaxed lifestyle, they move
to Florida and play... BASEBALL??

Yes, baseball. Jim Morley of Colorado Springs, former minor
leaguer, is in the process of forming an over-35 league for ex-
major leaguers.

The Senior Professional Baseball Association is slated to
house teams in eight Florida cities. Under consideration are
Miami, Daytona Beach, St. Petersburg, Sarasota, Fort Meyers,
Winter Haven, Port St. Lucie and either Orlando or West Palm
Beach. .

The teams will play a 72-game schedule from November to
January. The league will not interfere with Major League
Baseball’s spring training, which begins in February.

The players will earn a modest $5,000 to $15,000 per month.
Former major league stars may include ex-Pirate Al Oliver, Vida

THE PITT News, Wednesday, July 19, 1939

 

Tennis taking on younger look 

Overshadowing the victories
of West Germany’s Boris Becker
and Steffi Graf at this year's
Wimbledon is the sad but true
end of an era for four of the most
dominant players ever to enter
the tournament. Not to divert
attention away from Becker, and
Graf, but the realization that
Jimmy Connors, Chris Evert, John
McEnroe, and yes, even Martina
Navratilova may never win a
final at Centre Court again is
depressing.

Dan Goldie, a 2S—year- old
former NCAA champion from
Stanford, Conn. upset Jimmy
Connors, 36, neatly in the sec-
ond round. Connors did not
play poorly; he just could not
keep up with the quicker foot-
work of Goldie, plain and simple‘.

When asked about a possible
retirement, Connors answered
cooly, “I’m not playing for any-

. one or anything other than my

' own personal enjoyment. When

' I stop enjoying playing, I’ll quit."
Plain and simple.

Both Connors and Evert won
Wimbledon titles in 1974. Con-
nors may be coming back, but
Evert will not. Evert, 34, made
her ﬁnal appearance on Centre
Court in the semi—finals against

the No. 1 seed Graf. Graf effi-
ciently punished Evert with her
overpowering forehand: 6-2, 6-1.
Evert, whose playing against
Graf was uninspired, said she
was happy that she was able to
say her goodbyes from Centre
Court. When trailing 2-5 in the
third set to Laura Golarsa from
Italy, Evert swept the last five
games to win 6-3, 2-6, 7-5.
Navratilova, 32, sat at courtside
and cheered Evert on. She was
heard hollering cross—court,
“Come on, Chrissy!” Unusual for
a competitor, but not for a close

friend. Evert will be retiring to
her Florida home with husband
Andy Mill to start a family.

John McEnroe has been at-
tempting a comeback after sev-
eral breaks from tennis due to
nagging injuries and burnout. The
three-time champion played his

best tennis since 1984. The 30- V

year— old beat Mats Wilander in
the quarterfinals, but succumbed

to the youthful play of Stefan V if

Edberg in the semis. Both matches
were long and grueling, espe-
cially for McEnroe, who was
playing with everything from
death threats to an annoying
rotator-cuff injury.

Although McEnroe went un-
scathed by fines, he played with
the temper that has become his
trademark. Mac claims that fa-
therhood and age have mellowed
him. But to play as he once did,

he feels he must behave in the ,

way that made him successful in

_the past. However, McEnroe’s

injuries have caused another
break in his tennis,
dropped out of the Davis Cup
competition and does not look to

be a favorite in the U.S. Open A

later this season.

Martina Navratilova dominated
Centre Court in the ‘80s, winning
the women’s singles title six times.
She has not won a Grand Slam
event since the U.S. Open of
1987, however, and her career is
on a. decline. Navratilova is now
chasing the youthfulness of play-
ers such as Graf and teenager
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, the 1989

, French Open champion.

Navratilova, also suffering from
burnout, has lost two consecu-
tive Wimbledons to Graf. She
has been trying to get back on
her game, and has hired Billy
Jean King to coach and advise
her. King says she has helped
Navratilova think for herself and
take responsibility for her play-
ing. With King’s help, Navrati-
lova has come to terms with the
age issue. She‘ said, ‘‘It doesn’t
make any difference any more
because everybody is younger.
They are so much younger, I.
could be [al mother to some of
them.” When asked before the
final about retirement, she re-
plied, “If it doesn’t happen this
year I’ll be back next year, and if
not'then, I’ll be back the year
after. I am planning on playing
for a while.” , r »

If this is true, Navratilova may -

“I think it's going to be ex- A

of a more fulﬁlling thing than

“Basketball-wise, the
absence of three recruits might

be a problem,” Bozik told the

Post-Gazette, “but as far as the
university goes it would not be a
problem.” ~ _
’ Who’s kidding whom
here? This goes beyond the won-
lost record, beyond the talent
that will be ready to play in 1990.
Academia has simply eluded the
athletic department, and in es-
sence, the university itself.

If Bozik believes he has
upheld the integrity of his depart-
ment, ‘his university and himself
by placing theblame on the ath-
letes, he is mistaken. These in-
coming freshmen have every right
to accept a scholarship if it is

~ offered, just as Pitt has every right

to ’ deny a scholarship to an
unworthy candidate. Apparently,
however, performance on the
field takes precedence over per-
formance in the classroom.

Bozik has consoled no
one, least of all those who should
be foremost in his mind: the
‘paying public.

If nothing else, however,

open their 1989 training
— camp today at St. Vincent

year, 80 players are sched-

For the first time under
head coach Chuck Noll,
the veteran players are
scheduled to report on the
same day as the rookies.
With the NFL roster limit
set at 80, the team will also
cut back to just one full
practice session each day
. rather than the two daily
‘sessions they had in the

The Steelers will begin
