Pittsburgh Residents
Favor Students’ Trip
To Montgomery Ala.

Pittsburgh residents are generally in favor of Univers-
ity students’ civil rights trips to the South. At least that’s
the concensus of a spot-check interview conducted by The
Pitt News last week in a survey of city opinion. The resi-
dents were asked the same question that University students

were asked a week ago when queried: “What do you think 4

of the University students’ trip to Montgomery, Ala. ?”

Mrs. Margaret Wayda, Bates St.: “Well I think the
students did wonderful. They’re doing what’s right. I think
they (the students) should all stick together.” ,

Mrs. Jim Watts, 2847 Wylie Ave.: “Oh, I don’t know. I
haven’t thought the situation over. Well, I’ll tell you, I think
the students were rig-ht. I think we will eventually get
Civil Rights.” A _

Anonymous, 154 N. Belleﬁeld: “I don’t have any opin-
ion. I would rather not get involved at all.”

Ruth Walker, 1911 Forbes Ave.: “I think it was very
nice of the students to go down to Alabama.” In reference
to the people who were injured: “I feel very bad about this.

New SG to Study Extension
Phones for Greeks, Nurses

   

JERRY HOGAN, SG vice-presi-
dent, precides at his first SG
meeting.

By NANCY FUCHS

The newly-elected Student Government (SG) ‘unani-
mously voted to investigate the possibility of having exten-
sion phones installed in all Universit-y-recognized fraternity
and sorority -houses an-d the Nurses Residence at its ﬁrst
meeting Thursday night. _

Introduced by Senator Gerald Rosen and amended by

Senator Barbara Stevenson to include the nurses, the bill
provided for the formation of a committee to include “at least a

senator from the School of Nursing and one from the Greek system." ‘

The committee will work with» the administration to study the pos-
sibility with the understanding that SG will not be ﬁnancially re-
sponsible.

Rosen revealed that the drawbacks as seen by William Tranter;
administrative assistant in communications, are the ﬁnancial costs
and the availability of additional lines. The advantages of the in-
stallation of such phones would be a convenience and ﬁnancial sav-
ing for dormitory students and fraternity and sorority house resi-
dents and the removal of a portion of incoming calls to the Univer-
sity Answering Service. »

But what can you do?”.
Marcia Sanchez, 311 Oakland
Ave.: “Well, I guess the stu-
dents were right. I feel it’s part
of a radical movemen .”
W. C. St. Clair, Bigelow Blvd.:

. “I think those students are out

of their minds. In my opinion,
the Pitt students are going down
below zero.”

Mrs. Lawrence F. Sagone, Beel-
er St.: “I think the students were
right. It’s true, Negroes should
have the right to vote. I think
the people who went down there
(Alabama) showed that people
here wanted to "give them (the
Negroes) their rights too.”

Mrs. Abe (Corrine) Dennerk:
“It is my belief that those stu-
dents. who participated sincere-
ly in the Alabama march truly
fought to further a cause which
will help to make this country
greater. However, I cannot help
but feel that these were a small
minority of students who took
part only to be physically dem-
onstrative, without the tearful

. motivation that was necessary.”

Mt. Lebanon Housewife: “I'm
not particularly in favor of it.
There should be a better way of
expressing their feeling. The sit-
uation seemed almost like a cam-
pus fad instead of a true expres-
sion of their beliefs.”

Mrs. Samuel Snead: "I feel that
it’s a marvelous idea to let these
people know that you support
their right to vote. If this is your
method of expressing it, I think
it’s a good idea.”

Civil Rights Shenanigans
Prompt Proctor to Explain
Chapter’s ‘Rights’ Position

By AL JANEZIC

Ralph Proctor has his problems. It isn’t bad enough
that the NAACP clothing drive is sputtering and his group
1S being  for an assortment of civil rights and wrongs.
He s getting disgruntled at some of the “simple, immature,
stupid bigots” who slap “Compliments of George Wallace”
signs on clothing boxes and print and hand-color “Nigger”
posters to go with them. .

Proctor-is the excutive secretary of the Pitt Chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People who
wants to clear up a few things about civil rights .in general and the
NAACP in particular.

The image of the Pitt Chapter especially concerned him. “We
didn’t sponsor the Alabama trip, and the charge that we're split
in the civil rights movement simply isn't so.”

Some have said that the NAACP, the Congress of Racial Equality, V

the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee and the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference are working at cross-purposes.
“There is an implication that there is some sort of antagonism

among us. It’s not true. We all have certain positions «and jobs to '

  WPGHStaff perms
With Limited Budget

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN .

WPGH is operating on 650 kilocycles and a $2000 an
nual budget. No scholarships are givento staff members,
and students, some of whom spent up to 18 hours a day at
the station during the Alabama crisis, receive no salary for
the services they rendered.

When the three busloads’ of University students went to Mont- I
gomery, Ala., to register their protest against the denial of voting
rights to Negroes, WPGH became the main contact between the
marchers in Alabama .and the University community.

Speaking on the role of WPGH, Harvey Weissman, special news
editor of the station, explained that “every conversation made with
the people in Alabama was recorded directly. After each conversa-
tion was concluded the tapes were edited and fed to three Pittsburgh
radio stations—KQV, KDKA, and WRYT. _

“In general, WPGH’s coverage of theevents was superior to any
other news media,” Weissman added. “I’m pretty sure the others
(news media) relied on the wire services—at least in reference to
the people from Pittsburgh.”

During the days that the students were in Alabama, WPGH was
on the .air 24 hours a day. Engineers manned the station on a con-
tinuous basis, taking turns on the night shifts.

Dave Narr, the general manager of WPGH, remarked, “The
events of the past week in Alabama spotlighted and proved WPGH’s

‘Funny Thing’

By ROBERT HOROWITZ
A burst of drums and a
ﬂurry of piano music set
the mood for the funniest
musical 'of the Pittsburgh
' _ Playhouse’s season, A Funny
 Thing Happened on the Way
‘ _ to the Forum. This satirical
comedy is based on the plays of
the Roman classic playwright
Plautus and the book by Burt
Shevelove ‘and Larry Gelbart
with music and lyrics composed
by Stephen Sondheim.
True to the Roman plot,_ the
a Forum centers around funny man
' Dick Galuppi as the slave who
' connives to unite Jim Turner as
Hero, the slave’s master, and
Cynthia Holtman as Philia, a
virgin in the house of prostitu-
tion next door. His contrivances
pile up in true Roman comic
' fashion to explode in mistaken
identities, long lost children,
. carping wives, incestuous possi-
’ bilities—you name it it's there.

ance, his singing, his speech, and

best musical number, “Free,”
rings out true and clear. His
light and lively method keeps
the show on the go.

Stuart Howard as Hysterium.
chief of slaves, does an excellent
job. Second only to Galuppi, he
gives a sparkling performance as
the slave’s dupe.

The stiﬁ performance of Ger-
ald G. Goff as Hero’s father be-

warm reception. Jim Turner as
Hero was physically well‘-cast;
however, his acting and singing
left much to desired. Cynthia

Philia with her w.arm smile and
beautiful voice is the kind of
girl one would bring home to his

she comes from a house of ill-

stand on civil rights as stated in

The letter indicated that “events

cern among Pittsburghers which
could, conceivably, make it dif-
ﬁcult to maintain the relatively

position as the primary source for quick coverage of news on cam-
pus. Unfortunately, our ability to provide this kind of service to the
University community has been hampered by .a lack of ﬁnancial sup-
port. I would hope that the type of news coverage provided by the
Alabama situation would point out the need for increased support
for the second primary news media on the University of Pittsburgh
campus.” _

Nathan Firestone, former graduate advisor .to WPGH, empha-
sized, “Certain administrators understand our ﬁnancial needs, but
they are unable to give anything but moral support. Others have
failed to recognize the fact that a radio station needs a great deal
of capital to get started.”

“The technical difficulties are due in part .to the fact that we
don’t have the money for the proper equipment," Firestone added.
He ‘emphasized that this was “good in the sense that it requires a
great deal of ingenuity from the staff members. The station has grown
to over 80 full-time functioning members. Still, the administration
refuses to recognize that it is signiﬁcant on campus. Although I ap}
preciate the limited nature of student affairs budgets, I also appre-
ciate that certain. administrators have given a great deal of help.”

Commenting on the prospects of WPGH, Narr emphasized “At
this Point Whafs needed is 3 genuine demonstration of concern on

the part of the administration. That concern -should» take the form
0f a large cash grant.” . ,

Graduates, Faculty Members
Demonstrate for Passage
Of Voter Registration Bill

Twenty Graduate School of Social Work students and
three faculty members have returned from a demonstration
for the Voter Registration Bill in Washington, D_.C. The
Pittsburgh students joined 125 students representing nine
eastern -universities and 35 states in day-long marching,
lobbying, and picketing at the U.S. Justice Department on

March 19.

The University, the only col-
lege that sent faculty members,
sent the largest delegation to the
demonstration. Dr. Samuel Men-
cher, professor of social work;
Dr. Irving F. Lukoff, associate
professor of social Work; and
Field Supervisor John Conley
were faculty representatives in
the demonstration.

Mrs. Roslyn Barbolet, ﬁrst-year
University community work ‘stu-
dent and acting secretary for the
group, said, “It is hoped that this
will be the beginning of a more
dynamic role‘ by social workers
in the area of social action.”

perform so that one is not more _

important than another.”

All donations that the NAACP
receives go toward the freedom
fight. Proctor said that the NAA-
CP offered to pay the bond of
Pittsburgh students jailed in Ala-
bama but they refused it.

“Many think this way,” he ex-
plained, “because they reason
that paying the bond only con-
tributes to that city’s budget.

“In Pittsburgh,” he said, “many
get arrested, are ﬁned $10, pay
it, and then go right back to the
picket line.” But such practices
can be a drain on the NAACP
budget.

Proctor is irritated that the Uni-
versity Theater ticket sales for
the play Woyzeck went poorly,
and he feels that it was because
the proceeds were to go to the
civil rights movement.

“Many people, especially in the
South, feel that a white who
helps a Negro._is worse than a
Nigger. They feel a Negro can’t
help being a Negro,” he said, “but
that a white can help. being a
Nigger lover.”

Proctor believes that it is im-
portant to work in the South,
but more important to “work in
your own homes and own neigh-
borhood.

WPGH, in a recent instance, did an outstanding job of covering the
_Alabama crisis. When University students were in Alabama last week,
WPGH taped frequent phoned reports from them in Montgomery. Its
round-the-clock, direct coverage du-ring that period showed what a campus

station can do.

This reporting was often the only link with the students down there.
In addition, the news was usually six to eight hours ahead of the wire
services providing exclusive coverage. WPGH also held interviews with

With all the furor over Vietnam and the
threats posed by both the Russian and Chin-
ese communists in Asia, the United States
has seemingly ignored the turbulent condi-
tions that exist in the continent directly

-below us—South America.

Yet, the unstable conditions of most
South American countries are breeding
problems that are as serious as those in

Vietnam, the only dif-

Vietnam is the site
Where the Commun-
ists and the United
States are openly con-
fronting one another
in the current stage of
their ideological bat-
tle. -

THIS CONCEN -
TRATION in Vietnam
by the United States
' g has led our country, to

MISS GOLDSTEIN neglect the dangerous
threats posed not by Communism, but by an
enemy that has supposedly been stiﬂed,
Nazism.

A recent article in The Pittsburgh Press
by United Press International reporter Jack
Brannan, dealing with a neo—Nazi group in
Argentina, desc-ribes how these modern-day
Nazis “smash windows and throw ﬁre
bombs at Jewish schools, synagogues and
homes.” Brannan relates ‘how “they are
blamed by the. police for the murder of at
least two Jews, for causing injury to many

    

more. They once abducted a young Jewish‘

boy and cut a swastika into the flesh of his
forehead.”

These activities draw a striking parallel
with the Nazi movement in Germany before
and during‘ World War II. This parallel can
be drawn two steps further. Only one mem-
ber of the group was ever arrested by the
police, and he was released without charge.
And. the leader of the Tacuara (the name of
the Argentine group) is none other than

’ \\V\\ 

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

ference being that ,

Horst Adolph Eichmann, the 27-year-old
son of the most powerful and ruthless
Nazis, SS. Col. Adolph Eichmann.

PERHAPS THE most dangerous sim-
iliarity of pre- and post-war Nazism is the
fact that neither movement was suppressed
by the government. Brarman related in his
recent report information from sources to
the effect that “-neither the government nor
the police can afford_to make a real crack-
down on the Tacuara.” These sources em-
phasized that such an action would be “em-
barrassing to many high government and
military officials who have strong Nazi and
fascist sympathies dating back to the early
1930. The sons of these officials form the
leadership of the Tacuara.”

-Such a situation cannot be allowed to
prevail in our modern world. The lack of
foresight by the United States during the
Big Three conferences of World War II trig-

gered the present conﬂict between the So-‘

viet Union. and our nation. When World
War II ended, the United States emerged as
the superior country of the world. By al-
lowing Russia to move into Germany and
Eastern Europe and not recognizing the

* danger she presented to freedom, we height-

ened the dimensions of the ideological split
that exists today.

We cannot afford to make a similar mis-
take again. Although the Nazis in Argen-
tina can hardly compare with the threat
posed by the Russians, they still must be
checked. The recent history of the world
shows that no menace to the well-being of
a group of persons or to a country should
be ignored. To do so would be like re—ex-
tending the open invitation that Hitler re-
ceived in Germany thirty years ago.

By taking the position as defender of
the free world, the United States must do
all in its power to change the maxim that
“History repeats itself.” In the case of
Naz1?m, history cannot _afford to repeat
itse . ‘ '

I T Students Rap

Freedom Rally

Editor, The Pitt News:

The I “Freedom Rally" held
Tuesday night was hardly more
than a farce. Barely 10 per cent
of the students present heartily
backed the rally. The others
either forced the rally to evolve
into an idiotic scene or turned
away in disgust.

(Nor did the main speaker,

H”; ~ Professor David Montgomery, cov-

erer himself with glory. Some of

 ‘_ his comments, we believe, were‘
. ‘strictly out of order. “Alabamians

mean . . . by law and order, the
suppression of rights for the
black man.” All Alabamians, Pro-
fessor? Hugo Black is a native
of Alabamaian. And even the
Selma Safety Commissioner, Ross
Baker, deplores the repulsive tac-
tics employed by Sheriff James
Clark in suppressing the rights
of Americans.

Dr. Montgomery went off on a
tangent concerning the voting
bill now pending in Congress.
Declaring that the bill was no-
where stringent enough, he ad-
vocated the dispersing of Federal
troops throughout the state. -And

We believe that President John-
son has the right approach; that
is, dispersing Federal troops only
where needed. And that, only as
a last resort.

The fact of the matter is, Pres-
ident Johnson did disperse Fed-
eral troops around Selma and
Montgomery following Governor
Wal1ace’s refusal to do same.

The fact of the matter is, that
the voting bill now pending, as
reported in the current issue of
Newsweek, was wholeheartedly
approved of by Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King. I

F’   ‘Execs

Business Program

Under the sponsorship of the Graduate School of Busi-
ness Administration, the 34th session of the Management
for Executives (MPE) is now under way and will continue

5‘ until May 10. The program, whose objective is to help the executive
participant accelerate his self-development for his own and company’s
beneﬁt, consists of 32 participants representing 22 different organi-
zations. .

Dr. Albert W. Frey, professor of marketing and director of the
Executive Development Program, commented that among the par-
ticipants in the program are ﬁve men from Brazil, Chile, Morocco,
and Venezuela. “Our program,” said Dr. Frey, “is the second oldest
of this type.”

MPE tries to help the participant become a better executive, not

V/only through increasing his understanding of his function and its
relationship to other company functions, but also through educating
him about government, economic, and social inﬂuences on company
policies the organization and communications network of the ad-
ministrative process, and available and developing analytical aids.

The program is an attempt to improve executive’s performance
in his present position and to prepare him for responsibilities in ad-

. vanced positions. The program exposes the executive to new ideas

' and to inadequacies in current business knowledge.

The ﬁrst week of the program is devoted to Management Train-
ing Laboratory, in which the students are assigned to continuous
training groups in an attempt to create a better understanding of
individual and group behavior.

Following this, students study courses related to business, eco-
nomic, ﬁnancial, and marketing policy, administrative practices, in-
dustrial relations, international operations, .managerial. accounting
and proﬁt planning, and quantitative techniques in management. In

’ addition to this, various lectures and tours are planned for the
students.

MOBT STANFIELD
Consistent Pole Vaulter

By RON SHEARER .

Track comes but twice a year, and the outdoor
season begins next Saturday at Morgan State.

Each winter Coach Carl Rees prepares his run-
ners and ﬁeld men for the indoor season starting
in January, and then trains them for the outdoor
campaign. The team usually does poorly indoors
and then redeems itself in the outdoor meets. This
year will be no exception.

After a mediocre indoor season, the trackmen
should improve greatly outdoors. “We expect to
do better outdoors,” said Rees, “and there is no
reason to believe otherwise.”

The indoor season included wins against a
poorly-conditioned Kent State squad and a weak
Slippery Rock team, and losses to Anmr and Navy.

The squad seems capable of substantiating
Rees’ statement. With Dick Crout and Bill Del-
Vecchio running three events each, Rees will get
two more races from them than they ran indoors.
Booth will probably run the 100-yard dash, the
quarter-mile, and the mile relay.

_DelVecchio placed fourth at the IC4A and a

seventh at the NCAA in the 600-yard distance,‘

-: proving he is the class runner Rees had predicted.

Besides these stars, the team includes the duo
of Luddy Hayden and Fred Poellnitz in the hur-
dles. Both are consistent runners, and Rees does
not worry about the event. Poellnitz should im-
prove outdoors where the longer distances will
allow him to use his long legs and stride to good
advantage.

Hayden will also compete in the broad jump
and the mile relay. He took sixth at the IC4A
meet in the broad jump and is certain to improve
now that he has an opportunity to practice the

event. There are not adequate facilities at the
Field House to practice the broad jump during
the indoor season.

The team is led in the long distance races
by a squad of undefeated cross-country runners.
They are paced by Dave Eichenlaub, who ﬁnished
ninth in the two mile run at the IC4A, John Bailey,
and Damien Koch.

Jim Studnicki runs the middle-distance races,
and Don Hinchberger rejoins the team for the
half-mile and possibly as a member of the mile
relay team. He will be testing his injured knee
which sidelined him during the indoor season.

Two big questions dominate the ﬁeld events.
Has Dave Sallach recovered from an injured back
enough to be effective in the high jump? And,
how "effective will shot puter and javelin man
Jim Flanigan be by dividing his time between
track and football?

Their performances must be good for the team
to score well in the ﬁeld events. Other ﬁeld men
include consistent pole-vaulter [Mort Stanﬁeld and
dark horse Dave Hangosky, who steadily im-
proved his shot puting during the indoor meets.

It requires at least two meets before Rees will
know how balanced his team will be. In the

opener at Morgan State, the sprinters and jumpers I

will face stiff competition. Against Miami of Ohio
in the home opener on April 16, the distance men
will be pitted against excellent runners.

The outdoor schedule has two home meets,
with Miami of Ohio and a triangular, meet with
Penn State and Notre Dame. The remaining ﬁve
meets will be away, plus the Penn Relays, IC4A,
the Central Collegiates and the NCAA competition.

last weekend at the NCAA
tournament in Laramie,

Wyoming. Coach Rex Peery
took only three wrestlers, and
the lone point came with a ﬁrst
round win by Boni.

Boni won the 147-pound East-
ern championship, but Buzz Hays
of Arizona State pinned him in
the second round of the NCAA.
“It looked like Boni deﬁnitely
had command,” said Perry, —“but
all of a sudden the tables turned.

Boni led Hays 5-1 with 17 sec-
onds remaining in the second
period. “Then Hays stepped off
the mat,” recalled Peery, “and
when they started off again, Hays
escaped, took him down, and pin-
ned Boni before the 17 seconds
were up.” Hays ﬁnished fourth
in the 147-pound division.

Boni beat Michigan _State’s
Rich Cooke in his ﬁrst round
match. Cooke and Boni had a
draw in the _Pitt—MSU dual meet
‘‘‘‘’“°’ “#13 f5‘?“§9n» -19-u.t..<‘Boni.

Both O’Kom and Hall drew

“O’Kom had a real good match

said Peery. Jenkins wrestles at

“Hall had a real tough ‘draw

Perry. Tribble was one of the

By GEORGE LIES

The football team's big-
gest problem this Spring is
finding good talent to fill
the graduated-depleted cen-
ter and guard positions. A
total of six starters at these
position graduate this month.

Center coach Walt Cum-
mins must— choose the start-
ers from six players, four of
whom are freshman. “Because
of the weather, the team has only

rpracticed a few times and only
through observation of the boys,
their agility, their handling of as-
signments and blocks, can you
see what the boy can do,” said
Cummins.
“You also have to see them in
q competition, either in a line “run-
off” (one line pitted against an-
other) or in a scrimmage. The
boys don’t have much experi-
ence but I think they will do
okay,” Cummins added.
The four freshman candidates
Cummins named for the center
_ spot include Tom Mitrakos,-- Ber-
nie Hensgen, Richard Genter,
and Andy Beamon. Genter and
. Hensgen are converted guards.
Jock Beachler and sophomore _
Bob Taylor are’ the other two
prospects, and both saw limited
action last year.
At the guard position, coach
Steve Petro has more to work
i with than Cummins. “There are
12 players trying out for guard,
each with a limited amount of
experience,” he said.

“Every position is open,” said ,

Petro. “even (uosh) Namrm

doesn’t have it made. I want him
to have conﬁdence that he’ll start
but he needs a challenge and he
has to be scared. L

“Right now I’m looking for the
ﬁrst six guards (the traveling
team‘) and until I’m,satisﬁed, I
will keep switching around, mak-
ing changes everyday,” Petro
added.

Petro said it is still too early
to cite any potential starters
“since I have only worked with
them a few days, but you can’t

and Bob Qualey played last year.

Both coaches said» that the new
“I” formation, installed by head
coach John" Michelosen, will not
alter the playing of either the
center or guard positions. In
fact, it may be advantageous to
the players. _

“The offense dictates the align-
ment of the defense,” said Pe-
tro, “and since there is going to
be a lot of moving around in the
backﬁeld with the “I,” the line

Team a  aces Pro lems at I

will beneﬁt, especially in setting
up blocks.” -

Cummins pointed out that the
offense has .an advantage when
there is a‘ shift in the backﬁeld
because “the defense must change
and this causes a shake up of the
opposing players.”

Even with the addition of this
“I” formation, the Spring prac-
tice still carries Michelosen’s
theme of “fundamentals and well
rounded players.” There is no
two-platooning, everyone plays
offense and everyone plays de-
fense.

“We always encourage more
boys to play and this results in
a higher degree of efficiency,”
said Petro, “but I believe that a
boy who can play offense besides
defense should be used as much
as possible, barring injury.

“Of course, you "can condone
the athlete with limited ability
and the player who is better of-
fensively than defensively,” he
said.

Other students saw the obvious
purpose of the play in creating
.a mood through the use of sound,
lighting, and dialog, each of
which was necessary to the total
effect.
The play is so filled ‘with sym-
bolism that it is impossible to
"understand it after only one per-
formance. According to the ex-
pressionistic tradition, all of the
other characters are seen through
the eyes of Woyzeck, played by
William Kingsley, who threw

Therefore, most of the minor,
symbolic characters are on the
stage very little.

‘‘ Jeff Embler, as his friend An-
dres, admirably contrasted “sane-
ness” to Woyzeck’s feverishness.
The fool was shown by Robert
Horowitz, mostly through his ex‘
cellent miming, to possess intui-
tive knowledge of feelings, while
the doctor, Frank Maraden, add-
ing humor with his ridiculous
parody of medical research, ser-
iously showed the danger Of 3

treating human subjects like rats,

symbolizes heat, and perhaps
“normality”

The technical aspects of the
lighting during the play suffer-
ed some difficulties. The cos-
tumes, on the other hand, were
excellent.

If the play has a message, it
is that there is no Supreme Be-
ing, and everything happens by
cause and effect, with the good,
and the hard-working, not nec-
essarily getting the rewards. This
pessimistic philosophy is very un-

usual for a play written during

Romanticism.
