Town Meet
Will Present
NLRB Head

Recently appointed Region-

al Director of the National La-

, bor Relations board, John F.

Lebus, will speak at the second Pitt

Town Meeting at 2 :30 o’clock today,

in 324 Cathedral. His subject will

be “Economic Security Through
Collective Bargaining.”

Mr. Lebus has had, despite his
youth, much practical experience
in dealing with labor problems. An
economics major, he graduated from
Texas Christian university in 1934,

‘and worked several years for gov-
ernment educational agencies.

_ In 1937, Mr. Lebus became asso-
ciated with the National Labor Re-
lations board in the Fort Worth and
Chicago offices a-s a ﬁeld examiner.
He came to the Pittsburgh of-
fice, headquarters of the sixth
region of the Board, in a similar
capacity in November, 1941. A
fortnight ago Mr. Lebus was ap-
pointed to ﬁll the directorship
left vacant by Charles T. Douds,
who is now in charge of several
regions.

Persons attending the meeting
will have an opportunity to ques-
tion Mr. Lebus following his speech,
in line with the usual procedure of
Pitt Town Meeting. Harold Gon-
delman, C43, PTM committee mem-
ber, reminded that this is the stu-
dents’ chance to question a labor
man on the Little Steel case and
possibility of widespread general
wage increases.

University Schedules Class
In Pre-Aviation Education

Cooperating with government and educational leaders
who have recommended that students in public schools be
taught the prniciples of aviation, the University will inaugur-

ate a special two-credit course in
pre-aviation education for school
teachers and administrators during
the post summer session, August
10 through August 21. H‘
. Teaching this novel course will
be Miss Elizabeth Warnock, n in-
structor in Taylor-Allderdicehigh
school and a licensed pilot and li-
censed ground instructor. Miss
Warnock has also passed written
tests and expects to pass ﬂight test
for ﬂight instructor rating within
a few weeks. '

A graduate of Pitt, Miss War-
nock holds the M.A. degree from
Columbia University, and has
taken additional graduate work
at Pitt and at the University of
California, Los Angeles Branch.

She has served as a ground in-
structor at Pittsburgh Institute of
Aeronautics, Bettis Field, for the
last three years, and is now teach-
ing a ground schoolcourse for pri-
vate and commercial pilots and a
ground course for the Civil Patrol
Training Program. She is a member
of the committee which wrote a
course in aviation for the Pitts-
burgh public schools.

The course at Pitt will deal
with the history and development
of civil and military aviation, or-

3? ALEX ZELENSKI

At ﬁrst it was thought of as nothing more than wishful
thinking, but late last week Pitt’s ﬁrst informal Chancellor?
reception on the Cathedral lawn became a reality.as Acting ‘f
Deans Helen Pool Rush and Theodore W. Biddle announced,

the ﬁnal plans for the party.

True, rain may cause a little annoyance next Thursday

but the general chairmen of the
student-faculty “get together” have
also thought of that. So if it rains
the party will be moved indoors to
the Commons Room.

Two hundred invitations were
given to upperclass men and wom-
en last Friday to appear at the re-
ception as aides, and the faculty
members have promised their fuil
support.

' The reason given by the Deans
for the lawn party was that the
faculty and students could get
acquainted with one another. That
-is one of the main values of col-
lege life, and every student that
can attend, should attend, they

, added.

Pitt’s concert band under the di-
rection of Robert Arthur will be
present at the party, playing
marches and concert selections
throughout the evening.

Chancellor Bowman, Vice-Chan-
cellor Rufus Fitzgerald, Dr. Frank
Shockley, director of the summer
session, along with the deans of

the various schools and a large

number of the instructors will be
present to take part_ in the eve-
ning’s events.

The Chance-llor’s reception will
begin at 7 o’clock and continue
until 9 o’clock, at which time re-
freshments will be served on the
Bellefield plaza. 0

Lieutenant John Finnerty

is Bostonian From Ml T

By BILL PANKUCII

Lieutenant John Finnerty, new-
est member of Pitt’s military sci-
ence department combines a rich
Bostonian accent with his lectures
to the junior ROTC students. The
Bostonian accent is derived from
the years that he spent as a stu-
dent at the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology.

After spending two years at
Boston college, Lieutenant Fin-
nerty felt the desire to become an
engineer, and so he transferred
to MIT. Here he completed a four
year course in three years, with
plenty of time for his full sched-
ule of activities.

Some of his activities at MIT
included president of Technology
Catholic club; president of Mortar
and Ball, honorary military frater-
nity; and member of Phi Kappa,
social fraternity. During his spare
moments he also managed to
squeeze in two years of varsity
hockey.

As an ROTC student he spen-t
the summer of 1931 under Col. Cul-
len, one-time member of Pitt’s
ROTC department, at Fort Mon-
roe, Virginia, where he acted as
editor-in-chief of the Blast, camp
newspaper. It was there at camp

that he ﬁrst came to know Sergeant
A. A. Gunter, a top sargeant who
made life plenty tough for the green
young soldiers.

“Rise and Shine” Gunter who
earned his nickname by pacing up
and down the camp street at 5:45
o’clock shouting, “Rise and shine!”
is now a master sergeant stationed
in the military science department
here at the University.

“He’s a real soldier," is Finner-
ty’s terse evaluation of his former
top-kick. .

Graduating as a mechanical and
electrical engineer, Lt. Finnerty
soon went into the heating, ventilat-
ing, and air-conditioning business,
where he was president of his own
ﬁrm in New York until his recent
return to army "life as a second
lieutenant.

During the few years since his
graduation, he has written two
engineering manuals and was list-
ed in the 1937 edition of Who's
Who in Engineering.

He’s still an eligible young bach-
elor, gals, although he admits he
almost took the fatal step last year.
His golf game hovers in the high
80's, but he modestly admits he
could do better with a little prac-
tice.

Sequels to the so-called “best sellers” are rarely
successful. Somehow, the reader is always conscious
of the fact that the author has carefully dedicated
himself to reproducing all the elements that made the
ﬁrst book a success, and all,too often what was suc-
cessful before now becomes merely redundant.

But Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings’ “Cross Creek” is

I something else again. This is the non-ﬁctional sequel-

to “The Yearling” and isthe story of the “Yearling”
country, the swamps of »*‘Florida, and of its people.
“Cross Creek,” Mrs. Rawlings tells us, “is a "bend
in a country road, by land, and the ﬂowing of Loch-
loosa Lake into Orange Lake, by water. ~ «

-“We are four miles west of the small village of

Island Grove, nine miles east of a turpentine still,,.

and on the othergsides we do not count distance at all
for the two lak.es and the broad marshes create an
inﬁnite space between us and the horizon.
, “We are ﬁ_ve white families; “Old Boss,” the Glis-
sons, the Mackays andthe Bernie Basses; and two
colored families, Henry Woodward and the Mick-
énses. People in Island Grove consider us just a
little biggety and more than a little queer.”
With broad, deft strokes Mrs. Rawlings has drawn
a carefully detailed, warmely human picture of‘ the
Creek and its strange collection of humanity. And
each of its twenty-three chapters, any one of which
would stand‘ as a separate essay, is punctuated with

“The ancient enmity” which takes up the subject of
snakes. This chapter is worthwhile if only for Old

“Ain’t.got no footses an’ kin slide so.” ‘

‘ Rivaling only the chapters on the animal life of

“WINTER"

by Pieter

by VIOLA LEWIS
The exhibition of excellent re-
productions, paintings, and draw-

. ‘Pings by Pieter Brughel now on
display in the Fine Arts gallery on P

the seventh ﬂoor, demonstrates
vividly that the work of a great
artist of the past can have signiﬁ-
cance for today.

[His realistic portrayal of the
Massacre of the Innocents,” this
famous biblical scene, shown here
as it might have happened in a
sixteenth century Flemish vil-
lage, takes on grim reality in
these frightening days of Lidice.

The general horror of the theme,

the sacking‘ Of a peaceful village,
has been painted by Brueghel in

subtle colors, and with amazing
powers of composition. It is also in,
details that the poetry of his paint-
ing is revealed to us. In this exhibi-
tion enlarged sections are hung be-
sides a representation of the paint-

ing as a whole.

The breadth of the artist’s vision‘
can be seen in his wide range of sub-.
ject matter. Social consciousness in
contemporay painting is anticipat-
ed here in the tenth century in
Brueghel’s comments of peasant
life which are amusing, penetrating,
and humanitarian.

Brueghel’s landscape painting‘,
“Winter”—-—is a magniﬁcent em-
ample of his ability to master

' paiiorama and minutiae.

points are: P . . - ~ A

defects. 4 - _
