Name Change Proposed
By President of VVSGA

Commission of the Women’s Self Government Associa-
tion of the University of Pittsburgh has approved the pro-
posal of President Christine Taylor, Col. ’58, to change the
name of the organization to the Associated Women Students.

The‘ plan ‘was voted upon at the annual WSGA retreat
at White Sulphur Springs Hotel, near Bedford, Sept. 5 and 6.

Final ‘approval, however, willO

depend on the vote of full-time
undergraduate women students.
all of whom are automatically
members of WSGA :Plans for a
special election are still being
made and will be announced later.
Two Reasons Given

Miss Taylor gave two reasons
for the proposal: First, WSGA is
a member of the Intercollegiate
Association of Women Students
which has repeatedly asked its
member organizations to assume
a common name for the sake of
uniformity. '

S e c o n d, misunderstandings
among administrators, faculty
members, and students have
arisen as to the meaning or the
word SELF-GOVERNMENT in
the title ,

She eplained that the word re-
fers to self-expression in the
taking part in government rather
than the setting up of rules and
regulations .

Bowman Visits -

Highlighting the retreat was the
visit of former Chancellor John
Gabbet Bowman, who headed the
University from 1921 to 1946. He
told of hisexperiences in raising

(Continued from Page 1)
X-rays. People who have received
no polio shots to date may take
the November shot as their ﬁrst.

Eligibility Announced

Persons eligible for the free
polio vaccine and chest X-ray
program are as follows:

(1) All persons who took shots
in the February and March
campaigns 1 a s t semester
even if they have already
been graduated.

Full-time, part-time grad-
uate and undergraduate
students

Full-time faculty and full-
time employees ‘
Wives, husbands, and de-
pendent children of full-
time graduates and under-
graduates

Wives, husbands, and de-
pendent children of full-
time faculty and employees

There is no minimum or maxi-
mum age limit for persons par-
ticipating in any phase of the pro-
gram *

Pitt received nation-wide recog-
nition last February when it ﬁrst
implemented a mass program for
its personnel. The precision team-
work of medical personnel and
non-professional volunteers that
enabled the inoculation of 12,000
people in 4 days drew the atten-
tion of industrial and educational
personnel who wanted to run sim-
ilar programs in their plants

More Participation

It is expected that more mem-
bers of the University family will
participate in this campaign than
participated in the February and
March vaccine programs because
of the addition of the X-ray units.
Persons over 40 years who are in
little danger of contracting polio
do desire periodic chest X—rays

It will be possible for people
to take either the polio shot or
the TB X-ray or both.

Persons who desire to register
their whole families for the cam-
paign may schedule appointments
at the same time by ﬁlling out
cards for each member of the
family and by placing them to-
gether in an envelope which will
be provided for this purpose

Ready To Back
Rushing Rules

The IF Judicial Commission
has taken steps to ensure
equitable Help Week ac-
cording to the chairmen, Bob
Barrickman. In order to

“protect the fraternities,”
Judicial Commission members will
visit all Houses during their Help
Weeks to decide whether or not
the fraternities are complying
with regulations.

Barrickman stated that after
this check, should a complaint 
ﬁled against a fraternity, the Ju-
dicial Commission could “go to
bat” for the fraternity. Thus no-
one will be prosecuted unjustly.

The Judicary group will “se-
verely prosecute all malicious
and unjust acts,” of fraternity
groups ﬂagrantly disregarding
repeated warnings. The Com-
mission plans to enforce strictly
all rushing rules in the coming
rush period for the fraternities

The informal rushing period will
begin on Monday, Sept 23, and
close at 8:30 a.m. on Monday,
Sept. 30. During this period, fra-

the student. It is hoped that this
can be accomplished with the ex-

new facilities.

Students interested in from
ten to thirty—hour jobs per week
are invited to apply as well as
those who wish to work for just
an evening or Saturday.

Sherwood said that rates

.. Recently the Chancellor announced that all faculty of

the University would be “encouraged?” to -conduct original

research in addition to their regula'r“tea’c{hing loads.

This would broaden and refresh their outlook on their
own ﬁelds of knowledge and, ideally, those of others on
the faculty. _

V ' An incoming student and those already enrolled at the
University will therefore receive more for their efforts as
a result of being taught by people who are seeking knowl-
edge themselves. This would give to every student the
(opportunity to learn from someone abreast of his ﬁeld and
eager to remain so. A

There is, however, among college teachers as among
_ any group of human beings those who are particularly

gifted in the means of imparting knowledge. Those rare
‘virtues of compassion, perseverence and most important
the ability to communicate coherently and concisely‘ with
students is one which should save a teacher from the added
pressures of the laboratory, library and publishing house.

A student should therefore be guaranteed something
else for his money. That is the assurance that he will not
study for a ridiculously short -semester’ under one teacher
and change mlidstream to another, And that he will not
have to take a back seat to the other endeavors of his teacher.
There are researchers and there are teachers, and never
the twain shall meet without some strain, ‘

If the Chancellor will discourage students from work-
ing at part-time jobs while they are attending classes full-
time, then how can it ever be hoped that no interferences
with the primary interest of college professors will result
from their engaging in original research.

Time will tell whether students will be taught by re-
searchers in their spare time or‘ by hard—pressed, over-
loaded teachers. It doesn’t seem to be much of a choice.

The Catalog of Students

By DAVEQBREAKSTONE ,

This week as college student, genus Univer-
sitatis Pittsburghensis, treks back into his Gothic
classroom he may or may not be aware that there
is a steadily growing movement afoot to label him
with terms, or adjectives, wholly foreign to the
tavonomist.

Seemingly, as the American public becomes
more acquainted .with the current growing pains
which higher education is ex-
periencing, education buffs feel
the need to explore the present
campus crop of students with
an eye toward neatly categoriz-

ly turned phrase. . 

The “ﬂaming youth” of the f
Twenties has become as favorite A
a term has the “Depression kids”
of the Thirties. In the closer
years of the Forties, the “cautious  
generation” became a less apt standard. Unfortun-
ately, the search is on to pigeonhole the Collegian
of the Fifties with a similarly short tag.

(In a swift glance over articles appearing in
newspapers and magazines within the past year,
adjectives such_as “complacent,” “egotistical,” “ma-
terialistic,” “bored,” and “conservative” seem to ﬁnd
great favor’ as appropriate to the present student.
Of all of those words, perhaps only ‘conservative”
does not carry the connotation of repugnance.

Schooling In Prosperity

Certainly, then, the widespread opinion of the
collegian is not a positive one. A personal introspec-
tion into the causes of this phenomenon brings, to
light a series of interesting observations.

Initially, it must be admitted that the genera-
tion of The Fifties is going to school in an era of
almost unequalled prosperity. And with the pros-
perity of the parent, Junior is riding in low slung
sport coupes, spending money. freely (money which
incidentally, is now earned by the individual him’-
self at attractive summer labor), dating more often

than his father did, and marrying at an earlier age.

Cat On A Spot Can, Goof . . .

    

 

On the surface, at least, the modern student is
surprisingly homogeneous with his fellows. Super-
ﬁcial conformity is a present and undeniable fact—-
evidently markedly in the largest universities. (The
rebel today ﬁnds active and vocal company usually
in a small, semi—provincia1 school only.) The latent
individuality in all probably ﬁnds~’little release
safe in the plaintive yelps in complsory themes.

Security Or lmobility? -
The likeness, or sameness, of the typical stu-
dent is due to contentment. With the rapid technol-
ogy of our American machine the class-goer be-
comes attuned to the song of the “Wonders of
Progress.”-Soon, frighteningly soon, he realizes that

‘to a greater degree than any of his predecessors, he‘:

can plan his career with amazing accuracy, (With
the lowering of the draft quotas, even Uncle Sam
and his service is becoming less of a dilemma.)

Who is to argue with the premise of predictable
security for one and all? Hand in hand, therefore, .
with “built—in security” comes the epithet of “con-

servatism.” “Your own private world” is closer to , 

reality than the casualobserver would think.

The foregoing is not to be interpreted as a de-
fense of the “new breed” of student, if indeed he
is a new breed at all and not a reconditioned Stutz
Bearcat with power steering and futuramic tail

. lights. It is instead merely a deﬁnition of an ostensi-

bly growing “type.”

Untypical Type A

This “type” is easy to label with uncomplimen-
tary adjectives from an uneasy or disbelieving set
of critics. It is a .“type” which may tend, to be an
unthinking one. One. which could cater to an"“opiate

S It is a kindlwhich could become secure enough
to disregard threats to democracy and freedom. It

And the sooner the critics of the Fiftiesscrap
their investigations into the anatomy of the “aver-
age” student,.and get back to fundamental prob-
lems of educational expansion and improvement,
the more satisﬁed we shall all be for it.

Brigadoon Cast Relates Experiences

Of Summer Tour To The Azores

Capacity Crowds’
Welcome Players

At La jes Air Base

By ROSALIE GLAND
Editor’s Note: This is the ﬁrst of

three articles about the recent

tour ‘of the Pitt.Playe1's’ produc-
tion of ‘5Brigadoon”’to U.S. Air
Force‘Bases in the Azores, Ice-
land, and Bermuda.

The ﬁrstileg of their inter-
national tour sponsored by the
Military Air Transport Serv-
ice was a bus trip to McGuire
Air Force Base at Fort Dix,
New Jersey early on the
morning of June 2.

Upon reachi.ng McGuire, the 26-

member cast and their two advis-
ors signed in at the Transcient

1 Hotel and later reported to the

briefing room at the Air Base
Terminal where they received
their boarding passes. At 7:00
p.m., passes in one hand, coats in
the other, and cameras around
their necks, they boarded their
plane, a C-118 Constellation. '
T A Flight Described
«Describing the flight, Marylyn

1 Maysels, BA ’58, said, “The seats

were reversed, so we were flying
backward. It was hard to get used
to at ﬁrst. We were prepared for
thanks to Arthur
Steinberg who brought along a
small medical kit. Fortunately his

"services were not necessary.”

' One hour after reaching cruis-

, » ing‘ altitude, they were given box»

lunches. They took advantage of
their freedom to walk around and
visit among themselves. A talk
with the pilots who showed them
around the cockpit was another
highlight of the flight. Marylyn
aded, “Most of us liked the box
lunches best of all.” ,
‘ The East landed at Lajes Air
Base on the island of’Terceria,
one of the three islands which
comprise the Azores. They were
billeted in the B.O.Q. (Bachelor
Officers’ Quarters) and had their
meals in the Transient Mess Hall
at ﬁrst and then in the Officers’
Club. The latter reminded many
of a magniﬁcent New York night
club.
Two Theatres

The base boasts two theatres,
one of which is used only for
movies. It also has its own tele-
vision station over which Joan
Bails, Col. ’59; Tom Jenkins, Ed.
’57, and Larry Heller, C0. C01. ’58.

base, during which they perform-

tion. of being the ﬁrst group to
have at each performance a full
house of 3000 men. They were
also the ﬁrst grouplof their kind
to receive curtain calls.

Towns Toured

In their free time the Pitt Play-
ers visited the towns of Pria and
Angra. Pria is a very small town
whose inhabitants are very poor
and live under extremely unsani-
tary conditions.

Some of the group visited a
typical home in Pria. According to
Ethel Schacter, Col. ’59, the rooms
were quite tiny with bare walls
and almost no furniture. What
particularly appalled her was the
sight of flies swarming over a
new—born baby.

Larry Heller commented on the
fact that all the local children ran
around barefoot and begged the
tourists for money and cigarettes.
“Children as young as ten years
old smoke,” he added.

‘ Church Contrasts

As a contrast to this poverty,
the group visited .a church‘ in Pria
which dates from the ﬁfteenth
century. The entire interior is
adorned with gold and silver fur-
nishings and decorations. Larry
commented that throughout their
lives, all the earnings “of the is-
landers go for their church.

with a ‘great variety of flowers.
chiefly roses,” mused Marylyn
Maysels. She further stated that
the flowers were more beautiful
and bigger than any she had ever
seen. Marylyn assumed it was be-
cause. of the volcanic soil of the
island.

“It was a civilization all to it-
self,” remarked Ethel‘ Schacter
when describing a colorful old
Spanish market place in Angra.
“It was walled in on all sides,”
she continued, “a perfect square.
Trees were planted in the en-
closure, and the streets were very
narrow.”

Ethel explained that Angra is
the main business district of the
island.

Linen Hand-Made

The main source of income on
the island comes from their beau-
tiful Madira linen, which is made
entirely by hand. The group saw
its manufacturing process when
it toured a linen factory in Angra.
Many of the players took advant-
age of the fact that a linen table-

cloth can be bought on the island 3

for about $25; whereas in the U.S.
it would cost at least $80.

For their safety the Players
had to travel in groups of at
least two. For sanitary reasons
they were not allowed to eat or
drink in any Portuguese home or
restaurant. "In Angra they were
permitted to eat in an approved
sidewalk" cafe, but were ‘allowed
to drink only wine.

V Pride Exhibited

The players found the Portu-
guese—governed islanders very pa-
triotic and proud. An example of
this concerns Lajes Air Base. The
base is on ground rented to it by
the Portuguese government which
insists that no foreign flag will
ever touch Portuguese soil. Thus.
the American flag flying over the
base is sunk into six feet of con-

Others thought that the climate in

Through their tour of the is-

to make themselves understood
by the inhabitants. The natives
who spoke English went from one
extreme to another in that they
spoke either a very bad -English

“Should picnicking be permitted in the stacks?” and

Philip Morris Incorporated sponsors this column.
Philip Morris Incorporated makes Philip Morris ciga-
rettes. They also make Miarlboro cigarettes. Marlboro is
what I am going to talk to you about this year.

Before beginning the current series of columns, I made
an exhaustive study of Marlboro advertising. This took
almost four minutes. The Marlboro people don’t waste
words. They give it to you fast: “You get a lot to like _
in a Marlboro . . . Filter . . .»l<‘lavor . . . F lip-top Box.”

VVell, sir, at ﬁrst this approach seemed to me a little
terse, a bit naked. Perhaps, thought I, I should drape
it with a veil‘ of violet-prose, adorn it with a mantle of
fluffy adjectives, dangle some partliciplesfrom the ears
. . . But then I thought, what for? Doesn’t that tell the
ghole Marlboro story? . . . Filter . . . Flavor . . . Flip-top

ox. .

lVIarlboro tastes great. The ﬁlter works. So does the
box. What else do you need to know?

So, with the Marlboro story quickly told, let us turn
immediately to the chief problem of undergraduate life—
the money problem. This has always been a vexing
dilemma, even in my own college days. I recall, for
example, a classmate named Oliver‘ Hazard Sigafoos, a
great strapping fellow standing 14 hands high, who fell

in. love with a beautiful Theta named Nikki Spillane, «-
with hair like beaten gold and eyeballs like two table-

spoons of forgetfulness. .

Every night Oliver Hazard would take Nikki out to
dine and dance, and then to dine again, for dancing made
Nikki ravenous. Then they would go riding in the swan
boats, and then Nikki, her appetite sharpened by the sea
air, would have 8 or 10 cutlets, and then Oliver Haza.rd
would take her home, stopping on the way to buy her a
pail of oysters or two. ~~

, To raise money for these enchant-ed evenings, Oliver
Hazard took on. a number of part-time jobs. Between
classes he cut hair. After school he gutted perches. 1F rorn

dusk to midnight he vulcanized medicine balls. From

midnight to dawn he trapped night crawlers.
This crowded schedule took, alas, a heavy toll from

Oliver Hazard. In the space of a month he dwindled from 

2t‘)0.to 104 pounds—but that, curiously enough, proved
his salvation.

_~ _Today Oliver Hazard is a jockey, earning ahandsome
living which, combined with what he makes as a lymph
d_on_or after hours, is quite sufficient to curb Nikki’s
gll‘l1Sll appetite. Today they are married and live in Upper
Marlboro, Maryland, with their two daughters, ‘Filter
and Flavor, and their son, Flip-top Box.

 Kaliden To Lead Localse

Against National Champ

 

By DAVE BREAKSTONE

College football charges back into the ‘national sport
spot light this weekend and Pittsburgh will be hogging an
embarrassingly large portion of the opening glow. The local
stage stealing will take place on Saturday afternoon at the
Stadium where the 1957 Pitt gridders take on the defending
national champion Oklahoma, with all eyes of the football

’Oklahoma has a current win-
ning streak of forty straight
games dating back to’ 1953. The
last team to stave off the Sooners,
under Coach Bud Wilkinson, was
. Pitt, in a 7-7 tie, the second game
of that year. J

Head Coach John Michelosen, of
the locals, has a squad riddled by
graduation losses and plagued by
‘ inexperience and a corresponding
lack of depth. With Corny Salva-
terra and Darrell Lewis on the
alumni list, quaterbacking chores
V will likely fall to Bill Kaliden,
ffs lanky Homestead junior.

A’ Fourteen Lettermen Lost

Coach Michelosen will be start-
ing his third year as big man at
the helm of the footballers with a
formidable task of rebuilding
ahead of him. »

Fourteen of twenty-five
lettermen on last year’s Gator

Bowl squad have checked out

with diplomas, and another,

Tom Salwocki will be a first

string center for Uncle Sam’s

team.

Of the ten returning numeral
winners, only four, Kaliden, Dick
Bowen, Jim Theodore, and Dick
Haley are backﬁeld operators.
Lettering linemen. include All-
’A merica ‘candidate Charlie
Brueckrnan at center, ‘guards Dan
Wisniewski, Ed Michaels, and
Dick Carr, tackles Ron Kissel and
Jumbo Jim McCusker, and end
Dick Scherer.

Solid Center Line

The last mentioned McCusker’s

moniker “Jumbo” has inspired
«Pittsburgh wags to tag the Pitt
forward wall from tackle to tackle
as the “Five Jumboes.”

This quintet left to right, is
comprised of Kissel, John
Guzik, Brueckman, Wisniewski,
and McCusker and will average
a comfortable 225 pounds at
game time. Scheier ‘ and Jim
Zanos will ﬂank these ﬁve with
speed to spare.

The backﬁeld will show Kaliden
at quarter, Theodore at right half,
either Dick Haley or John Flara
at left half, and Bowen at full-
back, provided his pulled thigh
muscle and shin splints are in

.good repair. If Trainer Howard

 
  

 

Waite’s magic proves insufficient,
Bob Stark will pile drive from the
middle back post.
Second Team Key .to Success
The ﬁrst eleven appear to be a‘
solid crew. However, the lack of

 

‘ family on the drama. 6

, BILL KALIDEN
Salvaterra’s replacement

depth shows itself in the “B”
team where admittedly guards
Michaels anlrl Carr are the only
proven spots.

“The second team has to come
along in order for us to put up
a good show,” says Michelosen.
“The whole team has been
working very hard since prac-
tice opened on Labor Day and
we have made good progress.”

The coach plans to platoon this
year, a la Wilkinson, for he real-
izes the necessity of an entire
team of experienced subs in a
tough schedule such as the Jungle
Cats face in ’57.

Seaman to Place Kick

Weaknesses in the Panther line-
up tend to be at end and center
where the lack of experience is
the greatest. At the same time
and at these positions the compe-
tition is the strongest and im-
provement is most evident. Soph-
omores expected to participate in
the initial fray are backs Ivan
Toncic and Andy Sepsi, and line-
men Ernie Westwood, Nort Sea-
man, and Bob Rathi.

Speedy John Flara and Fred
Riddle will share the punting
chores. Seaman is a place kicking
specialist, with Kaliden and Ton-
cic as capable substitutes.

Sooners In, Confused State

By MURRAY CHASS

The history books tell us that
the name “Sooner” was derived
when a few settlers jumped the
gun in the race for free land in‘
Oklahoma in 1862. It was said
that these early birds got to the
free land sooner than any one
else. _

Thus the nickname
Oklahoma gridders.

However, after Saturday’s tussle
at the Stadium, Bud Wilkinson
and his gridders may turn around
and run the other way andwish
they had not faced the Panthers
sooner than any one else.

This will hold true especially
if the veteran Wilkinson is. as

of the

mixed up about his ﬁrst string

come Saturday as he has been for
the ﬁrst two weeks of practice.

In fact during this period press
releases from way down in the
oil country make it appear that
the Sooner squad has been as
mixed up as a couple of IBM com-
puters that were both asked to
predict if Oklahoma will have a‘
41-game win streak a week from
today.

The computer used by the Pan-
thers’ aggressive publicity man,
Beano Cook, predicted that Pitt
would win, 6-0. But the Sooners’
IBM mastermind told a conflict-
ing story and said that his em-
ployers would win 12-6.

And that brings us back to
Wilkinson’s confusion. The man
who‘ is the most successful coach
in the nation at the present time
actually has only four-returning

Frosh Gridders

Come In Force

An enthusiastic group of twen-
ty-eight boys made up the fresh-
man football contingent to Orien-
tation Camp at Kon-O-Kwee last
weekend. Frosh Coach Steve
Petro joined in the youths’ ela-
tion as he cautiously ventured the

opinion that ~“This is one of the _

ﬁnest freshman squads in many
years.”

In quantity, one must hark back
to the freshmen of 1953 to ﬁnd a
comparable aggregation. Twenty
seven boys landed on -that team.

Among the many names on this
year’s roster are some of the fol-
lowing: Jim Cunningham, a full-
back from Connellsville; Ed Sha-
rockman, St. Clair, Frank Boggs,
Carrollton, Ohio, and John Sakal,
Alliquippa, all quarterbacks.

Two ends Mike Ditka, Alliquip-
pa, and Mike Kuprok, Duquesne,
arrived ‘while Bobby La Rue, Mt.
Lebanon halfback, and Elmer
Merkovsky, Jr. of Wilmerding, a
tackle, sons of former Pitt greats,
also checked in ‘

Scored 18 TD’s in ’56

starters from the 1956 team that
won ten games, six of them by
shutouts.

These are Left End Don Stiller,
Left Guard Joe Oujesky, Right
Guard Bill Krisher, and Right
Halfback Clendon Thomas. The
latter two have been placed on
just about every pre-season All-

seem to bejenough for the Soon-
ers who have lost such stars as
QB Jimmy Harris, LH Tommy
McDonald, FB Billy Pricer, and
Center Jerry Tubbs.

Of course, Thomas led the na-
tion’s scorers last year and pro-
mises to do at least as well this
year if he gets the needed line
support. But even this outstanding
runner is not safe from the shuff-
ling Wilkinson’s wand. The 190-
pound Thomas, who _is described
in the Oklahoma brochure as the
son of an Oklahoma City roust-
about, was replaced on the ﬁrst
team for a while last lweeklby
the lightest man on the Sooner
squad, Johnny Pellow.

Nevertheless, there will be no
odds given as to ’whom Wilkinson

will use in the right side of the,

backﬁeld. when it comes time to
put number 41 on the block.
Thomas has plenty of speed and
should prove to be one of the
toughest runners the Panther de-
fense will see all year.

The Panther pass defense
should have little to worry about,
though. With the graduation of
Harris and McDonald’, the Soon-
ers are left minus a passing
threat. Harris hit on eight TD
passes last season and his tossing

 Panthers And Sooners
 Matchﬂeserve Strength

By ED KOLTISKA
Sports Editor

Well, its back to the football races again after a three
month vacation, and this season, the ﬁnish line should be in-
-vteresting to watch where the Panthers are concerned. Year
after year the schedule gets tougher and tougher while the

reserve strength gets lower and lower. "
In his two years as Panther mentor, John Michelosen has

V<,,,\,,{¢,_,,v,.,....¢ ,. V.

 

tutored his team to two Bowie

games with an overall 14-7-1 rec-
ord. Five of the seven losses were
to teams in the Nation’s top ten.
During these years, the Blue and
Gold were prosperous due to the
experienced reserve strength that
sat on the bench-

Slowly but surely this reserve
strength has disappeared
through graduation and now
Michelosen is ﬁnding it hardto
ﬁeld a complete second team.
The material is there but needs
to be brought along. And as far
as Oklahoma is concerned, it
couldn’t have been a better
time. Mainly because Bud'Wil-
kinson is facing a similar situa-
tion in Oklahoma. For the past
four years, Wilkinson has had
so many reserve teams that he
lost count after -ﬁve.

This year the Sooners lost
eighteen lettermen including sev-
en starters. The most important
of which were Quarterback Jim
Harris, Halfback Tommy Mc-
Donald, Fullback Bill Price, and
Center Jerry Tubbs. This season
End’Don Stiller, Guard Krisher,
and All-American candidate Half-
back Glendon Thomas will have
to carry the brunt of the burden.

As usual though, another solid
ﬁrst team will be representing Pitt
on the gridiron again this fall.
The line from Ron Kissel to Jim
McCusker including John Guzik,
All-American candidate Charley
Brueckman, and Dan Wisniewski

will average 25 pounds of solid ex-
perience. This center line will be
well balanced by veteran Dick
Scherer andaJim Zanos at ends.
In the backﬁeld, Michelosen
can show a lot of speed in John‘
Flara and Dick Haley with the
experience of Jim Theodore and
Dick Bowen while the power is
shown by Bob Stark.

National grid experts looking
over the teams this seasonhave
placed the Panthers
eight and ﬁfteen in the national
standing. Although Oklahoma is
rated number one, they will have
their biggest hurdle of the season
this Saturday against Pitt. ‘Nor-
mally the Sooners have been slow
starters and usually schedule
breathers early in the season to
enable them to work up to top
form.

This year the strategy backﬁred
in scheduling opening contests.
Coach Wilkinson makes no. bones
about it by stating, “Pittsburgh IS
the toughest hurdle on our sched-
ule since it is the ﬁrst. If We can
beat Pitt, we can play with the
rest of them.” .

Taking all into consideration,
including ﬁrst game jitters, the
outcome is hard to predict but
the strength of the forward wall
along with the home fans support,
the Panthers will give a good ac-
counting of themselves in their
opening game. After all you don’t
play a national champion all the
time.

With their tongues so far in

come out of summer retirement in

try their hands at missing as

Coach Michelosen
Returns In Time

For Grid Drills

The Pitt Panthers received a
little European flavor in their
practice sessions this Fall as
Coach John Michelosen tries to
shake off the effects of his trip to
Germany this summer.

Coach Michelosen returned Au-
gust 15 after ﬁve‘ weeks of coach-
ing clihics for Air Force Person-

nel. Along with Michelosen were
Coaches’ Red Sanders of UCLA.
Bill Murray of Duke, Cliff Speegle
of Oklahoma A&M, and Trainer
Dwayne Dixon of Indiana.

Upon completion of the.clinics,
Michelosen was surprised at the
number of Europeans that were
well acquainted with the rules
and the way that American foot-
ball is played.
