,_LVice-Chancellor Helen Rush
Defines SG’s Campus Role;
I Homecoming Gets Money

, By NANCY FUCHS
' Vice-Chancellor of Student Af‘fairs Helen P. Rush de-
fined the role of Student Government (SG) and established
conditions under which it should. function at a dinner-meet-
ing Thursday. Miss Rush called the meeting of senators,
Student Affairs Committeeffaculty and administrators to
(‘discuss Student Government in relation to the University.
" ‘tin her statement she explain-
ed her feeling that confusion has
risen from attempts to pattern
'SG’s structure and procedures af-
ter the U.S. government. “The,
parallel is not wholly accurate;
and the formalities, it seems to
me, are often not consistent with
the nature of an academic com-
munity,” she said.

Miss Rush questioned whether
the centralization of student au-_
thority or leadership is ,“unwise,
undemocratic, and impractical in

/___,_a large, complex uni_versity.”
”“>136inting out that not even eight
per cent of the entire student
body voted in the last SG elec-
tion, she asked, “Are you eﬁec-
tively serving as an instrument
for the majority of students,
whose purpose you are elected to
serve or are you now’ tending to
become a primary group instead?”'
She continued: “It is diificult

for large numbers of students
—,{xeven to know by sight those who
H’ run for oifice in an organization

purporting to represent 15,000

people. Therefore, Student Gov-
/ernment inevitably becomes a

K’ smail,. limited group with all the
. characteristics that implies. It
would be impossible for it to rep- _

.» resent the thinking of 15,000 with its aPPr°Va1 {ﬂake 1‘e_°°m'

voted down two different motions

the other reputed to support the t0 suspend the °1'd°1'S 0f the day

Miss Rush stressed that’ she
would like to see students “par-
ticipating with the faculty and

Lninistration on curriculum de-
:’cisions, course oﬁerings and aca-
demic policies generally. We need
you to think with us’on a Stu-
dent Activities Center, new‘ dor-
mitories, all building plans. This
is possible with a Student Gov-_
ernment that has established it-
self. with the student body, the

faculty, and the administration as
adult, not committed to faction-
alism, petty politics, power strug-
gles, or conduct that has no place
among cultivated men and wom-
en.”

After the ensuing discussion,
SG had its usual meeting. The
senate unanimously approved the
Activities Fee Allocations Com-
mittee’s emergency appropriation
of $1,000 for Homecoming. It was
stipulated that the money be
used. “to add to entertainment
only.” With the adidtional funds,
Homecoming Chairman Jimmy
Meyerson‘ hopes to‘ bring “big
name entertainment” to increase
ticket sales to the Commons Room
Homecoming dance. .

,_ The housing bill‘which Presi-
dent Jerry‘ Hogan returned for
reconsideration “because of a
basic conﬂict between the bill
and established= University poli-
-cies” was passed over his veto. ‘

The bill creates a committee of
four to thoroughly investigate the
social regulations in the men's
and Women’s dormitories. Within
a month the committee must sub-
mit its ﬁndings to the senate and

speak. . .

Senator Martin Engels intro-
duced a a bill sponsored by 22
other senators to communicate
student support for -U.S. troops
in Vietnam to the U.S. govern-
ment and the troops there. The
basis for student support was a
total of 3,826 names on petitions
and the 1,500 students at Wednes-
day‘s rally. -,_-

In ]onson’s Volpone

RICHARD GALUPPI who stars as Volpone ﬁnds ‘ho time. to relax
during play rehearsal as he continues to perfect his lines.

‘By DR. ROBERT F. WHITMAN,
Associate Professor of English
We are, today, prone to think
of comedy as the light-hearted
treatment of an inconsequential
subject. The dark side of man’s
nature, his endless capacity for
evil, we feel is properly the pro-
vince of _tragedy. Yet ever since
the.ﬁrst Herod stormed and
stamped about the stage, or the
ﬁrst devil had the audience roll-

ing in the aisles with his ob-

scene patter, in the Medieval mir-
acle and Morality plays, the com-
ic treatment of evil has been
very much a part of the English
dramatic tradition.

Ben Jonson’s early plays, the
so called “humor comedies” based
as they are on classical princi-
ples, ‘deal more with the follies
than the vices of human nature.
But in Volpone (1606) Jonson re-
affirms the vitality of the Eng-
lish tradition, and confronts di-
rectly the reality of evil.

It was conventional, in Eliza-
bethan Liter.ature, to associate
evil, as a violation or falling off
true nature, with
animality. In Shakespeare’s King

. Lear, for example, the vicious

General, Regan, and Edmund are
at various times likened to ser-
pents, wolves,,.and vultures.

In Volpone too, Jonson presents
us with a menagerie: Voltore( the
vulture), Corbaccio (the crow),
and Corvino (the raven), birds
of prey who in their monstrous
greed have become grostesque
perversions of nature. And be-
cause grotesque, they are ridicu-
lous, and hence laughable. Blind-
ed by their immense avarice to

any other considerations, wheth-
er of love or reason, these birds
of prey become themselves easy
prey to’ the clever plots of Vol-
pone and his servant Mosca.

But here Jonson has laid a
kind of trap for us. We are apt to
be so delighted with the ingenu-
ity of Volpone and Mosca, and
the enthusiasm with which they
torment and trick their “birds of
prey,” that we may lose sight‘ on
the fact they too are of the mena-
gerie, the fox, and the ﬂy that
lives in his fur, and are if any-
thing more monstrous than their
victims.

Indeed, one of the most strik-
ing features of this ‘-‘dark come-
dy” is the pervasiveness of greed,
extending even to such minor
characters as the judges, who
are only too happy to sell them-
selves, or their daughters, to Mos-
ca—-just as long as theﬁi think
him rich. The evil is so perva-
sive, and so passionate, that mere
virtue, in the persons of Bonario
and Celia, seem colorless and
feeble beside it.

But Jonson is not trying to sug-
gest that virtue triumphs over
evil just because it is evil: un-
balanced, a perversion, a mons-
ter. Unrestrained greed is rep-
resented, to use Shakespeare’s

words, as “an universal wolf, that

mustmake perforce an universal
prey, and last eat up himself.”

This is strong stuff; and the
conclusion of Volpone probably
comes as close to tragedy as com-
edy can and still be comedy. But
comic it is, grotesque, outrageous,
and monstrously funny.

Frosh Council Organizes;
Also Discusses -Leadership

Vice-Chancellor for Student Affairs Hele:n P. Rush
spoke at the second meeting of Men’s Freshmen Council,
last Tuesday. Speaking on the administration’s role in the
life of the University, Chancellor Rush said that both the
student leaders and administration officials can work to-
gether and learn from each other.

After her speech, Miss Rush
entertained questions from Coun-
cil members. When .asked how
students can gain experience and
become effective leaders, she re-
plied, “by learning from as many
experiences as possible and by
meeting different people on cam-
pus and talking with them.”

A student asked how much
authority the University Hand-
book has where it originated. In
answer to this Rush said that
the University Handbook repre-
sents the ideas and practices of
three generations of Student Gov-
ernment leaders as well .as the
ideas of three consecutive Vice-
Chancellorsl

Newly elected officers of Men’s
Freshmen Council are secretary,

‘Alma Mater’
' Reconsidered

- Editor, The Pitt News:

, ‘ An old deﬁnition of intellec-

tual is a man who can listen to
the William Tell Overture with-
out thinking of the Lone Ranger.
May I suggest a new one: an
intellectual is a Pitt student who
can listen to his alma mater
without thinking of either it or
Deutschland Ueber Alles.

As a European, I was pleased
to hear that Miss Rozia Reinhorn
et al were “experiencing new at-
titudes and learning many new

things" in Basel, Switzerland (let-
ter of‘Oct. 27). One of them even
attended a concert and sang
along when a “tune” ﬁtting the

general “description of our alma ,

mater was played.

The Swiss were apparently an-
noyed at this but, may I suggest,
probably not because of the piece

‘ of music (allegedly das Deutsch-

landlied, but rather because of

W, the rudeness of the interruption.

I'd be annoyed too. The so-called
“tune” to which Miss Rozie Rein-
horn refers is actually Haydn’s
Opus 76, Number 3 -— a string

_l quartet (a piece of music de-
' signed for a four piece hand). So

rest easily, Germanophobes; and
calm yourselves, Austrophiles!
May I thus suggest that on
their return, our cosmopolitan
and continental students serious-
ly ‘consider the advantages of
taking music 80 and invest in a
Schwann catalogue. Papa Haydn
has been insulted enough. Alas,

“but Asia begins outside the city

limits of /Vienna and‘ the bar-
barians are at the ‘gates. '

dent Director Committee, we can
no longer remain silent, viewing
the controversy between Dave
Urbaitis, former editor of the Di-
rectory, .and John Vrana, special
assistant to Vice-Chancellor Rush.
In reply to John Vrana’s state-
ment that “he never asked for
individual student orders” we
would state that several of us
were in the room when Dave Ur-
baitis spoke with John Vrana by
phone. Although we did not hear
the conversation vebatim, from
the re-iterations of  Urbaitis,
there was little question in our
minds that it was anything less
than individual orders that Mr.
Vrana was demanding.

Miss Rush stated in The Pitt
News (Oct. 27) that “we only
wanted some way of estimating
the demands for the Directory.”
Vrana said, “We only demand
some assurances of sales before
more Directories were ordered.”

Didn’t the sale of 1,300 Direc-.

tories in 13 hours show enough
demand, and constitute sufficient
assurance for sales, considering
almost one-third of the Univer-
sity was yet untapped. Apparent-
ly not.

The Pitt News further quotes
Vrana as suggesting “that in the
case of the Student Directory per-
haps the director of student pub-
lications would be a better ﬁ-
nancial adviser than himself.” If
he considers’ Mr. Rothman’s ad-
vice valuable now, why did he

Confusion, continually (dominates

 
 

neither consult nor heed _his ad- “

vice when the crucial decision
was made?

The “not so long” printing. time
of four days of which Vrana
spoke was ‘quoted by the printer
if he had the order Thursday,

. Oct. 21——a time when he had no

other committment pending. To
wait ‘until advance orders were
completed would. of necessity,
forestall printing and delivery, of
the books a great deal.

Mr. Urbaitis’ resignation did
not stem from this one incident

alone. He withstood the number-

less obstacles presented by the
administration from the com-
mencementof the Directory work
last summer until the present;
and the“ almost complete aban-
donment of his sponsoring or-
ganization, SG. ‘°
In conclusion, we would like
to correct the’ editorial mistake
in Mr. Rothman’s quote. The
staff Mr. Rothman was referring
to was the staff of other publica-
tions, not the Directory ‘staff.

Working as closely with the Di-"

rectory as we did, we feel cer-
tain that the additional Direc-
tories requested would have sold.
We were in complete agreement
with Mr. Urbaitis’ enthusiasm
and optimism. I

At Long I

The Right Method 

By Alex D’Ipp0lito

It took awhile but the inevitable ﬁnally happened. For
a long time now the American student and the American
public have been subjected to the pronouncements of a hand-
ful of radical students who have purported to speak for the
majority.

This radical minority is not everyone who disagrees

with American foreign.policy or who is upset with many,

aspects of American life. It is not merely disagreement that

method of disagreement.

IT IS the method of these people, their
beliefs, which I protest. /

At Wednesday’s rally supporting the
American soldier in Vietnam they were
proven wrong. The real majority spoke and
did so in a dignified and mature fashion.

  

THERE WAS no booing, no abuse cast
at people who disagreed with their position,
no sit-ins, no demands to force views on un.

, of others. .

It’s an unfortunate but almost unbroken rule of news
media that the sensational and the most vocal events get the
main coverage. Wednesday was different.

IT WASN’T the provocative loudmouths and demon-
strators who got the coverage. It wasn't the student who
is doing everything possible to tear down America. It wasn't
those who feel that they can use any extra legal and illegal
means to promote their causes. ”

Instead it was the student who works quietly for his
beliefs and realizes that change and improvement is a slow
process. It was the student who islooking for constructive
solutions to American’s and the world's problems. It was
those who believe that although America has many faults

 

 

is

has been giving the college student a black eye but the .

willing listeners, no disrespect for the rightsf”"7%~

\

it also has many virtues and that those virtues are wortlf“

being proud of.

It was the majority of this campus and of all the cam-
puses across the nation.

AND WHAT of the other few who heretofore have
been speaking in the name of the American college student?
They will go on supporting their beliefs as they have a right
and a duty to do. They will continue to disagree, which IS

, also their sacred right. But they will no longer be speaking

to America and to the world as representative of America’s
youth. Henceforth, they will be speaking as the small minor-
ity that they are. -
. And it is about time that this was so; I personally re

sent a supposedly esteemed professor such as Dr.~ Berko- .

witz, who lacking the open-mindedness that a man of his
profession should have, calls me a “clod” and someone un-
desirable to teachgbecause I don't fit into his idea of what
a student should be doing after class.

I personally resent when Eric Stern who calls himself
a student leader but who never led ‘anything but his own
fantasies, scurrys around after Wednesday’s rally picking

-up thrown away copies of his “journalistic alternative’;-_s_
while at the same time calling me and everyone else wh‘o*”

supported the rally “lousy Facists.” .

T r._ .-—
.V .
..

IT IS about time‘ that these “open-minded” professors '

and students realize that they speak only for themselves.
The real voice of the college student was heard Wednes-
day.‘ Some may say that the rally was flag waving, senti-

—mentalism, superpatriotism. But those who were there be-

cause they believed in what is right and what is good and
what is worth preserving in America, walked away a little
prouder and a little taller as a result of what took place.
This is the group which represents the future of Amer-
ica. If anyone, it is these who will preserve the heritage
the past and improve upon it in the future. This voice came’

from the heart and wasfinally heard.

It’s about time.

To Preserve Freedom

_ By ALAN DISLER _ _
“Our people more than anyone else want to have peace.
We have been fighting for twenty years.” So explained
Father Frances Le N goc Trieu, a Vietnamese Catholic priest
from the province of Long Xuyen, who was in Pittsburgh

~-ggcently.

Father Trieu, whose brother and three uncles were

‘ killed by the Viet Cong, has been travelling across the

United States and presenting the Vietnamese people’s View

of the war.

The Vietnamese people. want peace, he affirmed, “but

not at any price. We want freedom and not slavery.

is why we continue to fight.”
Describing communist tactics in
the South, Father Trieu said,
“This is ‘the way they treat peo-
ple: if you don’t follow them,
they kill you. They kill anybody
who helps‘ the government." In
‘—§u‘§."contested areas, he said, “the
communists use persuasion to
gain support of the people. If the
people refuse, they use terror-

, ism.” .

Asked about the feasibility of
negotiations with the commun-
ists, Father Trieu said, “If the
communists are sincere, we would

‘ask; what their price would be

for freedom.” Father Trieu re-

. Wﬁlled the recent Viet Cong of-
A ensive near Danang, the purpose

of which was to cut the country

negotiating table. This’ would
have been —their price. “They

have had men in South Vietnam, '

while the United States - would
have had to get out of the coun-
try. Then they would rise up
again and then demand two more
provinces for a settlement.”
Father Trieu cited the results
of the 1954 "Geneva Accords. “The
communists were supposed to get
out of South Vietnam, but they
didn’t retreat-—they hid. In two
years, they rose up and began
ﬁghting again.” If another agree-
ment is made now, Father Trieu
asked,
them?” _
Questioned whether United
States policy in Vietnam was the
right course, Father Trieu re-
plied, “If the United States con-
tinues to follow this policy, we
have some hope. The people need
security and protection. Eighty
per cent of the people live in the
villages. The number one prob-
lem istto give these people pro-
tection‘ from the communists.
“As soon as they know they
will not be harmed, they will

don’t help us they .are afraid to,”

The purpose. of this supple-

pro or con view on United
States Policy in. Vietnam. We

By ALAN DISLER _

Associate Professor of Political Science Joseph J. Zas- .

loff predicts an improving military situation in Vietnam but ’
is not as confident about the propects for political stability ,* '-

in that country.

Political Science Prof 

Sees Many Problems 
In a Vietnam Solution i   

ll"‘

 

“The military situation will improve}? he said, ‘but  
don’t see the government in Vietnam achieving unity among 

the leaders or support from the.
masses, and this is necessary for
a genuine solution.” As long as
the United States maintains a
large number of troops in Viet-
nam, Zasloﬁ continued, the mili-

' tary situation will be brought to

“a lower level of insurgency.”
What Dr. Zasloff particularly
deplores is the “wide-scale suf-
fering that the South Vietnamese
people have) been subjected to,”

P and urges that the United-States,

“in its pro§ecution of the war in
the. south, develop better discrim-

inationin the use of its airpow-.
per, artillery, and ground forces.”

Zasloﬁ .called for a cessation
of U.S. bombing of the north be-

cause of its “limited military val- —

ue and doubtful effectiveness.”
Continuation of the bombing, he
added, would. increase the

“chance of Chinese intervention,” .

and would make “a negotiated
settlement with Hanoi and the
National Liberation Front,_ which
should be our goal, more difficult
to achieve.” He said that the

bombings damage this country’s
,_ reputation an many parts of the

world. ,_

When asked why the political
situation in Vietnam could not
be expected to improve to the
degree the military situation has,
Zasloff said, “South Vietnamese

society is factionalized with reli-

 protest parades and
demonstrations of the Octo-
ber 16 weekend came off
well. The turn-outs were
large —- in New York City
well above the organizers’

advance estimate of 10,000—and -

t a’ broad spectrum of opinion W35
represented. To the disappoint-
ment of the photographers, at-
tacks on the demonstrators, East
Coast and West, were few and
mostly inconsequential. As a ﬁrst

a_ gmpt to orchestrate a nation-

"w " protest against the Johnson

Administration's‘ role in South-
east Asia, the occasion was high-
ly successful. r

But if any of the participants‘
joined this movement-under the
lighthearted impression that .they
could persist in this course with-_
out risk or penalty of any kind,
the reaction of the government
and the press indicated that as
the_ situation develops, courage

ntleffeld‘, but here at home. How-

reasonable .-

slackers, cowards, Communists,
and traitors. .

A certain amount of abuse will
come from respectable quarters,
including some of the churches,
as well as from hoodluvms and
frenzied patriots. That official
stigmatization will not be lack-
ing was shown by the release on
October 13 of the report of the
Eastland-Dodd "Internal Security
subcommittee: “The Anti-Viet-
nam Agitationland the Teach-In

lem of Communist Inﬁltration

however symbolic, the maximum
sentence for draft-card ‘burning

rash transgressors will fare.

This is already a good-sized war,
and it is going to get bigger. If
Pentagon aims are to be realized;

it is going to be a long war. It is .

a dirty war now, and it is going
to get dirtier, if that is possible.
Any nucleus of opposition is
therefore dangerous; like the war

,itself, it is likely to grow. Nor

cananyone guarantee that other
wars, elsewhere, may» not ‘spring
up -as suddenly as the not-yet-set-

What we are witnessing now is

\‘massive prophylaxis against mas-

sive future opposition.

It is important, on all these
accounts, for the dissenters to
know what they are doing, and
why they are doing_ it. Most of
the accusations that are 'ﬂung.at
them are‘ motivated either by

political expediency or by pas-
sion. In neither case can reason‘

avail; as Justice Brandeis said,

“War kAills_a1l love of truth."

Reasonable arguments, however,
must be weighed.

In the ‘October 17.-New York

A so is self-defeating. Before writ-

ing this column, Reston should
have read William Beecher’s long
article, “Vietnam Turnabout,". in

‘the October 14 Wall Street Jour-

nal. Beecher shows conclusively
that, in proportion as the war

goes better for our side, our in- ‘

terest in negotiation slackens. Un-
remitting opposition to the war
is the only force that will keep
the idea" of negotiation from be-
ing _complete1y smothered. The
average citizen," conditioned as
he is, takes a purely opportunistic
attitude. When the war goes bet-
ter, his passion for. victory rises.
The polls show this mechanism
clearly. Only a determined, vocal
minority can counterbalance the
perpetual alliance of the direc-
tors of “national interest” and
their unthinking followers. 1'

Morality, Yes ~- , ..

Emotionalism, No

By Robert Supansic

No one can argue bloated, dead bodies because death
has its own ultimate reality. Corpses can’t be argued espe-
cially when they were once your brother or the kid next
door and are supposedly the result of a great world—wide
ideological struggle involving ‘high principle. The thought
recurs that 320,000 Germans died at Stalingrad: in defens ~
of the most grisly political system of all time. Such things ''
are possible.

The absolute value of human blood has always been
high; what changes is why it is shed. This seems the basic
point that the organizers of Wednesdays Vietnam rally
missed. They circulated" a petition asking the student body
to recognize the fact that our boys are dying in the jungles
of Vietnam and to honor and respect their efforts. Please
note: The petition did not ask the students to support U.S.
actions in Vietnam. For it is the morality of that involve-
ment that is, and always has been, the real question at

stake.

BUT THE problem is wider and deeper. We are t”!
most powerful nation in history; and our responsibilities to
t-he rest of mankind are the highest, most binding, and _most
complex that any nation has ever undertaken. But until we
learn to judge the morality behind our actions first, we Wlll
be exactly what the rest of the World has been calling us:
a country of snot-noses, concurrently the most powerful and
the most adolescent nation of all time.

There is no place for emotionalism in foreign policy.
The energy unleashed by appeals to “support the boys over
there” is a dangerous energy because it is a blind energy,
prey to the first person Without qualms about escalating the
rally, the group, the nation, to a shattering point, to a mob.
It scares me to think of the German people making national
heroes out of their Sta.lingrad dead. tn

TO ALL strong believers: Do you ‘have two substan-
tial reasons Why we should or should not be in Vietnam?
If we do, in fact, belong in Vietnam, then let us support our
troops there with all of the tolerance and quiet rationality
at home that a free people can muster in time of war, ac-
cepting the deaths of our brothers and neighbors in the
solitude of our homes. If, on the other hand, we should get
out of Vietnam, then let us accept the tragedy of those
already dead and face up to our mistake. ‘

To try to gain mass support for a political policy, ng"
matter what the reason, by prostituting a very deep anti?’

very real human emotion is monstrous, and I damn the soul
of anyone who does it. Men are dying over there.

Mr. Supansic is a sem'or,honors history major and former president
of Pi pelta Epsilon, honorary journalism fraternity.

  Native Priest Affirms

U. S. Commitment

(Conlrrzizterl frmn Page 1)
the priest explained. “The people
know that if the government
routs the Viet Cong, from a vil-
lage in the day, “the communists
can always come back at night.

“The people are afraid for their
lives,” Father Trieu continued.
“We must protect the villages,
and the government of South
Vietnam must train officials and
set up village administrations to
get the conﬁdence of the people.
It is up to us. We want indepen-
dence for our country and we
don‘t want foreign troops on our
soil. Eventually the Americans
will have to go.”

Father Trieu asserted ,however,
that the United States will have
to remain in Vietnam for a long
time, regardless if a treaty is
agreed upon. “I expect the Amer-
icansrto stay for a while and make
sure the treaty is upheld,” he
said.

Commenting on the bombing of
the north by the U.S., Father
Trieu said that it “raises the
moral of the South Vietnamese
troops and people. The people
were afraid that the United States
would pull out of Vietnam. As
long as the U.S. stays.we have
hope.” 1

If the U.S. were to withdraw
from Vietnam now, ‘Father Trieu
asked, “What would happen to
the people? We. are not able to
face the communists alone. They
would take over. Who can guar-

-antee freedom in Vietnam be-

sides the United States? The UN
can’t do it, the control commis-
sion formed in 1954 had no
troops. Who would prevent the
Viet Cong from rising up again.”

’Asked about the extent of Com-
munist Chinese inﬂuence in Viet-
nam, Father Trieu stated that
Red China “just gives weapons,
technicians, and advisors, but no
troops. The Chinese took over
Vietnam several times in history,
for a total of one thousand years
of Chinese occupation.

“China is the number-one "ene-
my of the Vietnamese people. We
are not afraid of Chinese inter-
vention,” he said. “The North
Vietnamese are nationalists be-
fore they are communists. Ho Chi
Minh knows that if the Chinese
get in, it will be impossible to
get them out. He is glad to get
aid but no troops.”

Commenting on the wave of
anti-war demonstrations in this
country, Father Trieu said that
“they have the right to say what
they feel, but this is not the best
way to force the communists to
the conference table. The Com-
munists mistake the protests of
the minority for the majority.
They’ hope that in the near fu-
ture President Johnson would be
forced by the majority to negoti-
ate. So if we want peace. and
negotiations the best way would
be to unite behind the President
As long as the comniunists know
this, they cannot win,”

despite the United States attacks.”

Concerning the consequences of
an American unilateral, unnego-
tiated pull-out, Zasloifsaid that
this would be “extremely unfav-
orable.” The United States policy,
he continued, “has so escalated
our prestige and national invest-

iment in Vietnam that a precipi-

tate withdrawal would have un-
fortunate responses.” “
Zasloﬁ warned against aban-
doning\ the country “without
guarantees.” This would result in
what he terms a “ripple effect”

that there would be “unfortunate

consequences for U.S. interests in
Thailand, Cambodia, and Malay-
sia." He does not subscribe to the
“dominoe theory,” which main-
tains “that a United States pull-
out in Vietnam would result in
the immediate lost of Southeast
Asia to communism.

However, said Zasloﬁ‘, “precipi-
tate U.S. withdrawal would tend
to be read as abandonment of
United States objectives in South-
east Asia. It would cast doubt on
U.S. prestige and on ‘her credibil-
ity elsewhere.”

Asked if Communist China were
significantly involved in the Viet;
namese conﬂict, Zasloff stated
that China has helped the Viet
Minh since 1950 against the
French with supplies and other

aid. The Chinese are likewise. aid- ’

ing the Viet Cong, “but this is

not to say the communist move-
ment in Vietnam is dominated by
Peking.” China has yet to send
tropps to Vietnam. However, Zas-

, loﬁ said that a United States loss

“would be a great asset to Red
China.”

Turning to the subject of the
recent wave of anti-war demon-
strations, Zasloff stated that
“there is a legitimate place for
protest against government poli-
Cy‘: I respect the protesters’ rights
and support their freedom ‘_to
manifest their displeasure.” Zas-
loff noted that a small group of
demonstrators, who have been
particularly “extreme and abso-
lute in its denunciation,” have
been a detriment to their cause.
These extremists, he said, “help
to divert the responsible and in-
telligent criticism which we bad.
lyv need.”

Most of the students interview-

that such rallies give the G.I.’s -

support, especially if it gets into

mentioned Richardson. Miss Mar-
tin felt that such rallies help
contribute to the morale of the
general American public.

One student interviewed, a jun-

attend. “I didn't’ go,” she re-
marked, “because I don't support

  Seeks U. S. Support for War

By MARSHA REIINS

The largest applause-getter at
Wednesday's rally was Sérgeant
Richard Kujawski, home only a
week after two years in Vietnam.

Sgt. Kujawski wore the pur-
ple heart -for a leg wound from
a 30 calibre slug received at Bien
Hoa.after a year in combat “all
over Vietnam.” He received the
wound when the’ helicopter oc-
cupied by Kuyewski and 32 other
men was hit by ground ﬁre while
supplying troops along the front.
“I don't want to say What hap-
pened to the others,” he said.

Kujawski, a resident of Oak-
land felt that American troops in
Vietnam “are doing a lot of good
and that they are liked by the
South Vietnamese.” He believed
the North Vietnamese would even-
tually submit. .

The Dally. Kujawski said, made
him “real happy.” He hoped to
be able to get a ﬁlm of the dem-
onstration in support of Ameri-
can troops and send it to Viet-

nam. The ‘GPS, he explained,‘ re-
ceive hometown newspapers and *

are “depressed” by stories of an-
ti-administration demonstrations
and draft-doging.

He pointed to roads and build-

ings, ﬁnanced by the U.S. and
stated that the Vietnamese do not
feel they are being infringed up-
on by Americans.

Sgt. Kujawski would not com-
ment on alleged torturing of Viet
Cong or American use of napalm
gas. He did state that “there is
no gassing whatsoever down in
Vietnam.”

A question on the Sergean’ts
personal rather than military
feelings sparked a discussion
among on-lookers especially with
a British member of the Univer-
sity faculty. Comparing the sit-
uation with Nuremberg trials, he‘
said, “We are all involved as in-
dividuals, even when we stand
by and let things happen.”

Panthers Lose Run—Around, 5 1-13

Sports Editor

NEW YORK, OCT. 30 —
Two teams were evenly
matched at Shea Stadium on
Saturday, the Panther first
team and the Syracuse sec-
ond squad. For the first time
this season the gridders were
physically beaten. Mistakes hurt,
but so did Syracuse blocks.

Syracuse outweighted the Pan-
thers on the line by 15 pounds
per man and they used this
weight to full advantage. “They
were probably the strongest team
we've faced all season,” said
John Michelosen. “They were one
helluva football team.”

The only’ time the gridders
could move the ball was in the
fourth quarter when Syracuse

coach Ben Schwartzwalder, put in
his second and third teams. He
took Floyd Little out in the third
quarter after he scored four
touchdowns.

“There was no sense running
up a score today,” said Schwartz-

walder. “John Michelosen is one

guy who I don’t like to win big

over because he wouldn’t let his
team run up a. big score either.

“We’ve improved a lot since
the beginning of the season,”
added Schartzwalder, “the addi-
tion of Rick Csonka has made
Little even better because the
opposing teams can't just key on
Floyd and Csonka is a good block-
er for Floyd also.”

Litt1e’s great display of run-
ning showed he could go with or

without blocking. His team-
mates dropped one Panther after
another on punt returns and if
his blockers happened to miss
one of the opposition, a Little
fake took him out of the play.

Little changed speed, direction
and followed his blocking so well
on his 95 yard punt return that
he wasn’t even touched. “It was
one of the best runs of my ca-
reer,” said Little. Litt1e’s other
touchdown runs came on dashes
of 15, 26 and one yards. Alto-
gether Little had 97 yards in 14
attempts and Csonka had 90
yards in 13 attempts. Syracuse
had 308 yards rushing compared
to the Panthers 52. The Orange
had only 65 yards passing.

The Orangemen had no pass-
ing game at all. There quarter-

R-

back’s passing arm was poor and
it was obvious why he didn't
throw more often. He threw six
times, completing three. They
didn’t score on any passes. Mike
Koski ran 70 yards on a scissors
play that truly cut the gridders
in half. The other touchdowns
came on Little’s three runs from
scrimmage and interceptions and
fumbles.

The 24,590 fans in 55,000 seat
Shea Stadium could see it was
Syracuse’s game from the begin-
ning. At the end of the ﬁrst quar-
ter the score was 14-0 and at the
half, 37-0. In the ﬁrst two quar-
ters there were two fumbles and
two interceptions which led to
Syracuse scores.

In the ﬁrst quarter Bob Dyer

ped out of his hand and right into

“WE WUZ OUT . . I. ”

V NEW YORK, Oct. 30-—For the first period and a few
r.- minutes the Syracuse game was a replay of the West Vir-
;f_‘-‘ ginia fiasco. Syracuse grabbed the lead 21-O. But when the
 score was 28-0 and then 31'-0 . . .

It was repititious of the West Virginia game because
Syracuse scored at will. The only difference was that the
Panthers couldn’t comeback when they were behind 21-0,
as they did at Mountaineer Stadium.

They couldn’t comeback Saturday because they were

outmanned, outfought, outhustled, outhit and outscored.

 Syracuse is one of the Big Five, a mythical conference of
the powerhouses of the East. '

After their performance, the ‘Panthers can’t be called
a powerhouse when they lose to a team supposedly of the
same caliber. Syracuse had the better personnel but they
made their own breaks.

, They intercepted passes; they recovered fumbles. They
_kicked off short and hustled to get the ball even though

. I they were already leading 37-0. They blocked. They proved
they were an eastern power, and the Panthers were not.

 

. The gridders running game which was at its peak last
week was at its low this week. The Syracuse line was tough-
er. Twice Ken'Lucas tried a shovel pass to the halfback and
twice the halfback was tripped up by his own man lying
ﬂat on his back plugging up the hole in the line.

When Floyd Little returned the punt 95 yards he was

' surrounded by four blue and gold shirts, when he caught

the ball. They stood around and watched while he gave

them _a hip fake and was by them. Why didn’t they force

him to make his move instead of letting him go the way he
wanted?

 week the Panthers again played a complete foot-
ball game. There was only one trouble —- it was completely
bad.

West Virginia scored ﬁrst,
but the soccer team’s deva-
stating attack could not be
controlled as they swarmed
over the Mountaineers, 3-1.

The booters outshot West Vir-
ginia 35-1 and except for a few
WVU breakthroughs in the game,
coach Leo Bemis’ boys complete-
iy dominated the action.

“We were carrying the ball
game, but weren’t scoring,” Be-
mis said. “They had one shot and
they made it count, but we knew
we would break the ice. That
ﬁrst goal gave them additional
life and they had thoughts of an
upset, but we took the play and
the game.”

Dave Shaffer tied the score in
the third period when he headed
Ferd Sauer’s perfect pass into
the nets. And then later in the
game, Sauer himself almost found
the range. “Sauer is a hard luck
guy,” said Bemis. “All year his
shots have just missed being
goals, but he’s bound ~ to score
more this season.”

Sophomore Pete Snyder ac-
counted for the other two deci-
sive goals in the fourth quarter.
Both his shots came just to the
right of center. —

The ﬁrst, a follow-up shot from
a couple of yards " away, put the
booters in the lead to stay. The
other was from six yards away.
Shaffer assisted on the ﬁrst and
Dom Milillo, the second.

“During the first half, our
players were hitting their cen-
ter shots a little too high and
West Virginia's tall center-full-
back kept intercepting the ball.
This stopped us from scoring ear-
lier in the game,” Bemis said. I

It was also in the first half
Bemis lost the services of his
starting left halfback, Jim Sny-

der. He and a Mountaineer play-
er rammed heads.

“The opposing player required
seven stitches, but Jim lost his
memory for a little while. He
didn’t know who we were play-
ing or where he was, and his
memory didn’t return until we
came home,” Bemis said. “I talk-
ed with him yesterday and he
said he’s all right except for a
sore head. ,

Bill Zurzola replaced Snyder
for the remainder of the game
and kicked three shard shots

which almost resulted in goals.
Towards the end of the game.
Bemis used his bench. .“Our sec-

ﬁdent in using them in any
game,” he said.

Although Bemis has received
no information concerning the
booters’ standing with the NCAA
selection committee, he feels his
team will not be overlooked.

“We’re not going to murder
anyone, but we're tough,” Bemis
said. “During most of this game,

we got into scoring position quite-

often, but as always we could
not climax our drives.

“Right now we have no one
person who is a consistent scorer.
We’re able to move the ball at
this stage. Except for a few sput-

- terings, everyone is clicking, no

one player holds a hot hand.”

V\7hip West Virginia, 3-1, for Fifth Win »

By Roy JACOBS ,

The freshman soccer squad finished an undefeated sea-

son Saturday with a 5-1 victory over the West Virginia Uni-
ve1'sity frosh. The booters’ 3-0-1 record gave Coach Bob

McNulty his third undefeated team in four years as fresh- '

man coach.

“I don’t like to compare teams, but this is one of the

two real ﬁne clubs I’ve had. I
think they’re a great bunch of
guys, and I was proud to be their
coach. They made the season
themselves”,

Left wing J eff Rosenglick play-
ed “a fabulous g.ame” against
WVU as he scored three goals
and had an assist. The coach
also singled out his passing abil-
ity, as he made several good
crosses from his wing position.

Rosenglick opened the scoring
with a first period goal. Captain
Dave Shimpeno, playing center‘
forward, placed a tough-angle
shot in the goal from the left.
side after rebounding a missed
shot in the. second quarter.

The booters pushed through
three more goals in the third
quarter, while going scoreless in
a shortened fourth period. Shel-
don Zvoma powered in a penalty
kick, and Rosenglick followed up
his own corner kick for his sec-
ond goal.

“If the goalie_ had played it
right,” explained McNulty, “he
probably could have knocked it
out of bounds.” Rosenglick’s third
goal was described as “the pret-
tiest of the afternoon.” J eff ﬂoat-
ed the ball over the goa1ie’s head.
“It was perfectly placed, not
blasted.” C

“West Virginia compared with
Fairmont, but they were not as
good as Slippery Rock. They had
a couple of really good boys.”
West Virginia's lone goal was the .‘
only goal scored on the freshmen
from scrimmage all season.

Appraising the season, coach
McNulty said, “The team learned

-how to play together.» At ﬁrst

their fundamentals were a little

shoddy, but everything came up-
hill from the first game to the
l.ast.” He was also pleased with
the way the team took construc-
tive criticism and how they would
work on their own if their basic
skills needed improvement.

The coach felt a number of
the players can help the varsity
next year, especially two of
“equal quality to anyone on this
year’s team.” '

Jeff Rosenglick has “tremen-
dous. ability, speed, a, little bit of
cockinesst-—he right attitude for
a lineman, a. streak of meanness

 
  
 
  
    
  
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
   
   
 
   
  
   
 
 
 
 

when he needs it, and he is hun-
gry,to score.”

Dave Shimpeno “can go either
way.” Although he concentrated
on defense, stopping plays com-
ing down the center, he was the

team’s second leading scorer.
Characterized as “good for a goal

a game,” Dave scored the only
goal in the 1-0 victory over Slip-
pery Rock.

McNulty also mentioned Zvoma,
who is adept at ball control and
setting up teammates, and goalies
Dave Greenberg and Leonard
Harmon. ,

‘i As for next year’s frost, there
are “some ballplayers in this
area we want to look at,” but
the coach emphasized that he
hasn’t seen them yet, only heard

about them.
