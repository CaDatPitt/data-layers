night in Carnegie Music Hall, to
the almost continual chanting and
catcalls of the enthusiastic
audience.

God and Goddess Chairpersons
Danni Sadler and Keith Barsky
hosted the program in which
Greeks competed in events,
showing not only beauty, but
also talent and popularity.

During the toga event,
contestants adorned themselves
in various forms of togas, all
bearing the letters of their
fraternities and sororities, with
some bearing a. bit more than
others.

The talent competition featured
various forms of talents, some

quite reﬁned, others make—shift. .

Many of the performances
included musical renditions of
various tunes such as “Tell Me on
a Sunday” from an Andrew Lloyd
Webber production, and “Piano
Man” by Billy Joel. 0

Sophomore entrepreneur ‘WARTCHes’ sales grow

By Chris Kuzneski
Staff Writer

When DarenBerringer was a
senior at Indiana (Pa) High
School, he spent most of his
school day focused on his Swatch
watch, counting the seconds until
dismissal. '

Two years later, Berringer is a,

sophomore at Pitt, and his main
concern is still watches. Through
a strange twist of fate, however,
Berringer no longer wears a
Swatch because he is now
competing against it.

Berringer is currently a vice
president of the VP Group, a
corporation based in
Philadelphia, and heis in charge
of the western Pennsylvania
distribution of a new line of
watches called “The WARTch.”
(The name “WARTch” stands for
ART watch.) ,

“I was lucky enough to get in
on a business deal before it had
a chance to blossom,” said
Berringer. “As the company grew,
my importance grew, and things
have grown from there. I’m very
fortunate to have achieved the

things I have to date.”

Berringer said the first fortuitous
incident in a lucky chain of events
was his introduction to Geoff
Walsh by a mutual friend. Walsh,
who at the time was a senior at
the University of Pennsylvania,
was marketing the idea of a new
line of watches, which appealed
to Berringer.

“The idea was to place art
masterpieces on the face of a
watch, and it appealed to me
right off the bat. Geoff had already
done some initial research on a
product like this, and the response
was favorable. Before Geoff met
me, he was going to produce a
Mickey Mouse—type watch using
a likeness of Dan Quayle on the
watch face, instead. When the
idea proved to be short—lived, as
most political items are, he came
up with the art watch, but he
decided to keep VP [vice
president] in the company’s title. ”

When Walsh graduated from
Penn in May of 1989, he was
hired by Anderson Consulting, a
computer—consultin g ﬁrm in New
York City that sets up information
systems for corporations and

businesses. After working a few
months as a computer-
information analyst, Walsh
managed to save his first few
paychecks and acquire a series of

small loans. A short time later, a

Walsh started the VP Group.

“In the beginning,” said Walsh,
“Daren handled the majority of
market research because I was
still working atArthur Anderson’s.
I wasn’t sure how successful the
watches were going to be, so I
didn’t want to quit my job right
away.”

After acquiring the proper
licensing from galleries around
the world in order to duplicate
the art masterpieces (“an
expensive task,” said Walsh), the
VP Group hired a West Coast
watch manufacturer to make the
watches. Two months later, the
first line of art watches was ready
to be sold.

“We weren’t really. sure what
paintings were going to be
popular on a watch,” said Walsh,
“so we just‘ sort of picked the
paintings out of a book of
impressionist—art postcards at the
Penn bookstore. The original

watches were simply prototypes
of things to come.”

The original line of WARTch
watches depicted paintings of
impressionist "masters Claude
Monet, Vincent Van Gogh,
Georges Seurat and Edgar Degas.
Watches produced included
Monet’s “Water Lilies” and “Pool
of Water Lilies,” Degas’ “False

Start” and Seurat’s “The Bathers
at Asnieres. ” S

Berringer said that the initial
investment was under $100,000,
but it took a while before the
original line of “prototypes” was
successful.

“The response was slow when
we started showing the watches
in Philadelphia,” said Berringer,
“but after we got our feet wet,
things picked up quickly. Geoffs
hometown is Bronxville, NY,., so
he decided to start selling the
watches in New York City, and
they were a huge success there
after we got our initial retail chain
sale.”

The first major retail chain to
purchase the WARTch was Saks
Fifth Avenue, and after the
product was sold there, other

stores quickly began showing
interest. Within days, Berringer
and Walsh were contacted by
L.L. Bean, J. Crew and Signal, all
major mail-order catalogs, and
by many stores on the Eastern
seaboard.

“Saks Fifth Avenue was the key
to our success, without a doubt,”
said Walsh. “Without that sale,
we might still be struggling. We
had sold under a couple hundred

. watches until then, but [Saks]

gave us instant credibility all over
New York.”
WARTch Watches were initially

‘ sold in New York City for about
i $120, but Berringer said that they

areavailable in smaller cities for
about $50 less. “As far as New

' York goes, if a product is popular,‘

you can set your own price, and?
people still buy it. That just isn’t
the case in other cities, though.”

After selling nearly 2,000

watches, the VP Group decided A

to add a second line of watches
that depicted “more recognizable
and more modern paintings.”

‘police, who refused to file a report

because it was a fraternity
problem.

Watch

Continued from page 1
and Auguste Renoir were soon
included. In all, 15 paintings have
been reproduced.

With the addition of the second
line of watches, the VP Group
increased its inventory order with
its manufacturer, which lowered
the overall cost of production
per watch. The art watches now
cost less than $30 to produce and
are sold in stores for $70.

“Things have been going quite
well,” said Berringer. “We [the
VP Group] expect over 40,000
watches to be sold this year, and
that translates into over $1 million
in sales.” (Berringer estimates
that 25 percent of the sales ﬁgures
are profits directly acquired by
the VP Group.) “Unfortunately,
I’ve barely seen any money from
my sales because I keep
reinvesting the money in the
company,” he added.

Berringer claimed that
WARTch watches are not
available in Pittsburgh stores yet,

but negotiations are under way.
“It’s sort of weirdthat I haven’t
made any deals in the city since
I live here and all, but I’m
determined to bring culture to
Pittsburgh sometime soon,” said
Berringer, laughing.

Berringer mentioned, however,
that the watches are currently
available in Pittsburgh. Due to a
‘7non—traditional means of sale,”
they can be purchased on most
local college campuses through
a network of student salesmen.

“Each campus has its own

student manager [who] helps us

“The manager is then in charge
of getting the salesmen the
product, and they, in turn, sell
the product. This system really
doesn’t cost us [the VP Group]
anything, though, because
everything is based on
commissions and not salaries.
Students make money only if we
make money. “

“Due to the uniqueness of our
product,” said Berringer, “I feel
that we can create an enthusiasm
among our peers by using
students in the sales process. So

said Berringer. “I

far, things have gone great.”

Even though sales on the Pitt
campus have been going well,
Berringer said that he has been
having trouble with some of his
Pitt courses.

“My schedule is set up so I only
have night classes,” said Berringer,
“but after working all day, it gets
sort of rough. When I go to class,
I’m tired, and then I have to listen
to all these boring lectures about
theories and models. I have
already used most of this stuff in
the real world, so it is difficult

getting motivated in the
classroom.”
Berringer said that , he is

currently majoring in business
administration but has no definite
plans for the future.

“After graduation, I have the
opportunity to take over Sensing
Devices Inc, a company [in
Lancaster with offices in Los

Angeles and London] that makes

many types of temperature
devices for . machinery. It is
currently being run by my uncle
[Stephen Cornibertl, but he is sort
of semi-retired now and is hoping
that I take it over after getting my
degree.” V

Berringer stressed that his
uncle’s persistence is one of the
main reasons that he has stayed
in school to get his degree.
“Otherwise, I’d be going for the
dough.” said Berringer.

Before obtaining his diploma,
however, Berringer decided to
branch out and “ go for the dough,”
using his entrepreneurial skills

. and funds in the music industry.‘ 
arrange thenetwork, ” said Walsh. A —

Berringer‘: invested “a few
thousand dollars” in the career of
Rich Cocovich, a young disc
jockey from Indiana University
of Pennsylvania, who is
professionally known as “King
Richard the First.” Berringer’s

_ investment helped purchase new I

equipment for Cocovich, and in
return, he receives a percentage
of Cocovich’s appearance fees.
“I went to high school with
Rich, and I knew he hadtalent,”
realized,
however, that in order to be
successful, it is very important to

  1990 STUDENT SEASON FOOTBALL TICKETS
ARE NOW ON SALE FOR ONLY $9.00

 

UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH,

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

There will be nothing fancy
about Pitt football this spring.

Head coach Paul Hackett and
his staff will go back to basics
during spring practice in an
attempt to develop the team’s
potential and to fill specific holes
in the lineup left by graduation,
redshirting and injuries.

“My job as I see it is to try and
create an atmosphere for young
men to be successful, and I think
that really sums up_what I’m all
about,” Hackett said.

“Speciﬁcally, I’m speaking of
the ability to create an atmosphere
that allows a young man to come
to the university and be successful _
in the classroom academically, as
well as on the football ﬁeld as an
athlete,” he added.

One may think that Hackett’s
past experience as an offensive
coordinator for the Panthers
would predispose him to
concentrate on the offense as a

« major objective. Not so. The
offense will remain basically the
same.

Hackett is planning to develop
the defense as his primary .
objective this spring. Assistant
head coach and ' defensive
coordinator Fred vonAppen, who
joined the Pitt coaching staff in
February, will head the effort.

“The first thing that is very clear
to us, as far as we develop this
springtime, is a system of
defense,” Hackett said.

“The importance of this spring
clearly revolves around the
beginning of Coach vonAppen’s
system as it begins to blend with
some of the things that have been
extremely successful over the —
years here at the university.” 0

A major area of concern for Pitt
will be the secondary, speciﬁcally
the cornerback -position. With
the graduations of Alonzo
Hampton and Robert Bradley,
Pitt has some big shoes to fill.

Also gone is safety Dan
Crossman. However, Hackett is
optimistic about the return of
Louis Riddick and Doug Hetzler,
stating that they will complement
each other well at safety.

Riddick will be moved to strong
safety, and Hetzler will start at
free safety this season. Yusef
Washington will also see playing
time.

As for the corners, Hackett
named some young standouts
who he hopes will provide the
speed and quickness the position
demands. ’

Sophomore Barry Threats had
an impressive ending to his 1989
season as a backup corner, as he
helped to seal Pitt’s John Hancock
Bowl victory with a game-saving
interception. He recorded 31

tackles (21 solo) and picked off .

two passes during the year.

Junior Dave Coleman will also
be looked at to ﬁll the corner
hole. V

Hackett feels his team is
especially strong up the middle
with the linebacker unit. Senior
starters Craig Gob and Nelson
Walker, in addition to junior
standout Ricardo McDonald, have
both returned.

This year’s recruiting class
brings two Philadelphians to town
as linebackers. Hayes Clark, 6
feet 2 inches and 212 pounds,
and Charles Williams, 6 feet 3
inches and 240 pounds, will look
to provide ample substitution in
the already strong area. 0

Pitt football goes back to basics for spring practice

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News

Coach Paul Hackett will look to senior Louis Riddick (5) to provide leadership in the secondary.

this fall.

“It’s a ﬂavor that probably could
be described best as a multiple
scheme of defense where we’ll
use a lot of players, a lot of

alignments and multiple
substitutions,” Hackett said.

“Number one in the spring is
instituting and putting together
that system itself.”

Hackett’s general plan involves
individual skill development and
a uniﬁed teamconcept through
intensity in practice.

“The heart and soul of the
teaching we will do is skill
development. The ability to take
a young man’s potential and then
take his knowledge and now
really begin to develop his skill.

Baseball team drops three in a row ,

to Big East conference rival Seton Hall

By Ron Ledgard
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther baseball team
lost its ﬁrst three games of the Big
East season this past weekend
against the Seton Hall Pirates.

Saturday at Seton Hall, the
Panthers lost both ends of a
doubleheader. In the first game,
the Panthers went down 3-2 in
extra innings. Junior pitcher Bill

Brash went the distance but i

collected his third loss in as many
Starts.

“Brash pitched a great game,”
Pitt Coach Bob Lewis said. “I was
impressed with his effort. We just
couldn’t help him offensively.”

According to Lewis, the
Panthers playedta bad game in
the back end of the doubleheader.
The Panthers were shut out 12-0.

“We just didn’t help ourselves.
They totally outplayed us in that

one,” Lewis said.

on Sunday, sophomore Fred
Iriti tossed a good game, but as
the case went for the entire
weekend, the Panthers were
without timely hitting. Iriti kept
the game close into the eighth
with a score of 2-0, but eventually
the Pirates were able to take over
and make the final score 6-0.

The Panthers left 24 men on
base over the entire weekend.
“We just didn’t hit very well, ” said
Lewis. “We would K [strike out]
any time we got men in scoring
position.

“The Hall [Pirates] overpowered
us with their pitching. In the first
and third [games] of the series,
our pitching was good enough,
but [offensively] we didn’t get
anything done against their staff,”
he added.

The losses have extended the

Big East losing streak for the

To develop his talent to another
level that is closer and closer to
the potential that we felt he would

have had when we recruited him,” .

Hackett said.
In keeping with the theme of

going back to basics, Hackett, 0

wants to teach his team how to
practice together. He believes that

Panthers over two seasons. The
Panthers were 0-17 in the Big
East last year. 1

Panther Notes:

The next game for the (2-7) '
Panthers is against Duquesne at ,

Trees Field this Wednesday

afternoon. The game was "

scheduled for last Wednesday,
but the cold weather postponed
the action. Junior Des Schnur will
get the start. He got tagged for 12
runs in ﬁve innings during his last
start against Rollins College in
Florida.

The Panthers play at Geneva
on Thursday, and then they they
travel to Providence on Saturday
and Sunday.

In the Big East, the three- game
series is always a doubleheader
and a single game. The first game
of the doubleheader is a seven-
inning game, while the remaining
games are nine innings.

displeasure over the rule
change.

Ryan thinks that there is no
need for the change, as it is the
, pitchers’ responsibility to be
ready to play no matter when
the season starts. If starting
pitchers do not have themselves
in good enough shape at the
T start of the season to pitch at
least six innings, said Ryan,
then they are not doing their
jobs. He is absolutely correct.
Why won’t pitchers be ready
to play? In today's game, where
mediocre players. are paid
hundreds of thousands of
dollars, all players should make

playing shape whether they
have a full spring training or
not-. So what if the players were

it their responsibility to be in

locked out? There was nothing
to keep, let’s say, Doug Drabek
from calling up Mike Lavalliere
orjunior Ortiz and saying, “Hey,
let’s go throw some balls this
afternoon.”

Another question is: why are
the pitchers notready to play? If
the rules are going to be changed
to allow a starting pitcher a win
after only three innings, then
shouldn’t the rules be changed
to help hitters and fielders as
well? Since Andy Van Slyke
didn’t have the benefit of a full
spring of baseball, shouldn’t he
be given four strikes instead of
three for the first month?

Both pitchers and position
players should be expected to

report to Camp ready to play.’

It’s a good idea to expand rosters
for a month to give younger

players who otherwise would
have been overlooked this year
a chance to play at the major-
league level and even make

_ the team.

It is ludicrous, however, to
change a rule regarding a

pitcher’s eligibility for a victory. F

The gamewill not improve as a
result of this change. If
anything, it will only help to
inflate the pitchers’ records.
Ryan said that he would not
want to win 20 games this year
because the achievement
would have an asterisk beside
it. Unfortunately, the rules
committee neglected to realize
that there will be plenty of
pitchers who will be perfectly
willing to put that asterisk to
good use next year come
arbitration time.

Continued from page 5
a team can only get better by
developing itself through intense
practice situations.

Basically, he is looking for the
team to gel as a unit and wants to
achieve this by having his best
cornerbacks train against his best
receivers or by pitting his best
offensive line against his best
defensive line.

“No team in the country
practices casually during the week
and plays intense on Saturday.
That intensity is achieved through
practice,” Hackett said.

As for the offense, Hackett and
his staff put special emphasis on
recruiting offensive linemen in
order to engage in a rebuilding

process. In all, seven recruits are A

slated for offensive-line positions.

According to Hackett, the line
will be exciting to watch this year
because of the development
opportunity Centered around
three veterans: sophomore center
Chris Sestili, sophomore Mike
Livorio, who will be moved to
left guard to fill the vacancy left

by Chris Goetz, and junior Scott
Miller, who will play left tackle to
replace Roman Matuz.

Graduation reared its ugly head
in yet another area and will leave
the Panthers thin this spring.
Receiving will be marked by
inexperience, as sophomores
Olanda Truitt and Chris Bouyer
will head the corps. Junior Baron
Jackson will provide some
experience.

The running game should
remain strong, headed by fullback
Ronald Redmon. According to
Hackett, sophomores Jimmer
Bundy and Derrick Lewis should
complement Redmon well.
Hackett added, “There may be a
real dogfight forAdam Walker’s
old position.”

As for quarterback, well, it’s
hard to say anything bad about
Alex Van Pelt around here, and
Hackett looks for the sophomore
to fill his leadership role well,
expecting him to play even better
this season. .

Maybe the theme for this spring
should be “Great Expectations.”

Dean Brzscoe says Pitt strives
.’to address literacy in all majors’

By Jacinta Marie Dvorak
Staff Writer

When graduation rolls around in April, most of the faculty and staff
at Pitt feel the 1990 graduates will be ready to enter the workplace.
Basic skills and knowledge will be something that every graduate
will have to possess. But do Pitt graduates have what it takes? g

A recent Gallup Poll commissioned by the National Endowment
for the Humanities has reported that most students are lacking in
basic knowledge skills. The National College Newspaperreports that
58 percent of college students could not identify the author of The
Tempest. Some education critics are claiming that more time needs
to be devoted to studying the humanities in the undergraduate years.

Mary Briscoe, dean of the College ofArts and Sciences, agrees that
there are some areas in the CAS curriculum that students need to
spend more time developing. ‘‘I think that one of the most important
issues is the lack of information that students have about geography,”
she said. “We are attempting to address literacy in all majors.”

Surveys done by the Placement Service always rank communication
skills as being among the most important looked for by employers.
Robert Perkoski, associate director of placement, can give a good
picture of the skills employers are looking for in graduating seniors.

“From the employers that I have talked to, I would say that most

PLSAT vs. hardhat

If the job market fails the first time, there's always grad school

By Lisa Pugliese
Staff Writer

It seems that you’ve made it
through the ups and downs of
your undergraduate years of
coﬂege.

It’s been four scrutinizing years
of deciding who, what, when,

where, why and how to study. A

But somehow, you’ve managed
to choose a major, satisfy all of
the academic
register for graduation on time,
and make it to the Original Hotdog
Shop at least once a week.

Now you are faced with another
decision. Do you purchase a
tweed suit and apply for a job, or
do you sweat it out for another
two to four years in graduate
school?

According to Bob Perkoski,
associate director of the University
of Pittsburgh Placement Service,
the number of Pitt students
involved in on-campus job
interviewing has increased
somewhat this year.

“There has been real high traffic
this year [in the placement
centerl,” said Perkoski. “This
year has brought a large amount
of recruiting from the Fortune
500 companies. But the smaller
companies are making their mark,
too,” he added.

Perkoski states that government
jobs have been currently on the
increase because of such things
as better advertising. He said that
along with this, the retail industry
continues to grow in college

requirements, ‘

in the such occupations as
assistant buying.

As for “safe” majors that
guarantee jobs today, Perkoski
said that areas such as the health-
related fields (eg. pharmacy) and
engineering fare well in the job
market. Students need to be
selective in choosing majors
though, making sure that chosen
areas of study coincide with their
personal interests if they wish to
be successful in both school and
the job market.

“People must be careful. You
don’t want to be guided too
much by the media,” said
Perkoski. “[Studentsl must be

realize, though, is that smaller
companies, as well as companies
that are not widely advertised,
can also offer rewarding positions.

The newer industries making
waves in the job market include
banking and sales, which with
commission added can be higher-
paying positions.

The environmental—service
industry also is proving to be a
new source of jobs. “We are
facing the graying of America,”
said Perkoski. According to
Perkoski, as the population
continues to age, careers such as
nursing—home facilitators
continue to open up.

Liberal-arts students continue
to have the hardest time finding
jobs, primarily because
companies do not recruit these
majors as often as others.

As far as what companies are
looking for, some place high
emphasis on grades, with others
placing moderate emphasis on
them. Skills, personality and
activities can also play a part in
the hiring process.

“Grade emphasis depends
upon the history of the company,”
said Perkoski.

A large problem for current
college grads can lie in the area
of experience. Many companies
want professional experience,
and most students simply do not
have it.

Astudent’s participation in one
or more internships during his or
her undergraduate years can
prove beneficial. “I think
[internships] are a real plus,” said

Perkoski. “They should not be‘

For many graduating seniors,
buying a car is no longer a dream,
but a reality. However, those visions
of cruising in a red Ferrari often
become clouded by prices, dealers
and used-car lots.

The great look of a car is only
one of the many factors to consider
before making such an important
investment. Many students would
probably appreciate some advice,
and now there’s some place to get

people, especially students, need
not only advice but also time and
transportation to look for a car. His
service is designed to meet all of
these needs for his clients.

“I started this business because I
remember when I was looking for
a car. I had no transportation and
would have to pay people to drive
me around to dealerships,”
Williams said.

For a fee of $25, Williams does
all of the driving around for his
clients. “I locate three or four
vehicles based on the clients’
specifications, and then we go out
and look at them,” he said.

Unfortunately, many students do

Health professions jobs for the '90s

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

AS Pitt enters the 1990s, the job
opportunities are good for both
science and liberal—arts majors,
although the health-related ﬁelds
are probably going to expand the
most.

“It's the graying of America,”
according to Robert Perkoski,
associate director of the
placement service. “People are
getting older and need more
health care.” He added there have
been job fairs just for the health-
related professions.

The placement of students in
the School of Health Related
Professions in jobs is 100 percent,
according to Deborah Durica,
director of the Ofﬁce of Recruiting
and Admissions. Durica added
that most students have their
choice of positions and accept a
job offer before they graduate.

“The demand for these ﬁve
professions that we educate is
rapidly growing," said Durica.
Every year, the school graduates
70. physical therapists, 30
occupational therapists, 30 health-
records administrators, 20 to 25
clinical dieticians and nutritionists,
and up to 25 medical

P technologists.

“By the year 2000, there will be
an estimated increase of 14,000
jobs, or 54 percent for dieticians,
using data provided by the Bureau
of Labor Statistics,” Durica said.
The statistics also indicate an
increase of 53,500 jobs, or 87
percent for physical therapists,
and 29,900 jobs, an increase of 75
percent for health-records
administrators over the next

decade.

“Using data provided by the
American Occupational Therapy
Association,” Durica added, “by
the year 1995, there will be an
increase of 43,500 jobs, or 93
percent for occupational
therapists.”

Durica also noted that “there
are over 200,000 medical
technologists employed in the
nation's clinical laboratories, but
there is currently a 12—percent
vacancy rate in these labs,” and
that the average starting salary
for a graduate of the School of
Health Related Professions runs
from the mid $20,000s to the mid
$30,000s.

Perkoski saidthatotherstudents
who are guaranteed jobs when
they graduate are engineers and
computer-science majors.

“We’re starting to see different
industries hiring people,” he said,
adding that these people can get

jobs anywhere from
pharmaceutical companies to
banks. “These industries are

picking up computer-science
majors, engineers and people
from other sciences like chemistry
and biology majors.”

Kevin Collins, a placement
counselor for engineers, said that

it is “hard to deal with numbers”
on employment, but added that
most engineers have a good
chance at being hired, barring
any negative economic trends.

“With the recent events in
Eastern Europe, students are
looking at defense-related
industries with some concern,”
Collins said. “The auto industry is
also in a slump. Those are the
only two spots on the horizon;
jobs are available.”

Collins also noted that if
students want to stay in Pittsburgh,
they may have to shop around,
but if they are willing to relocate,
“that’s going to help considerably”
in the search for employment.

However, there is also good
news for non-scientific types.
According to Perkoski,
corporations have become more
interested in hiring liberal-arts
and business majors over the
past few years.

“We’ve seen companies looking
for salesmen and managers,” he
said. “Companies look for good
communication skills. They look

Prague professor picked

for Pitt ’s commencement

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

AS part of Pitt's commitment to global awareness, Radim
Palous, rector of Charles University in Prague, Czechoslovakia,
will be this year’s featured commencement speaker.

“At this time of stunning change in Eastern Europe, the
University of Pittsburgh is highly honored that Radim Palous
will speak,” said Pitt President Wesley Posvar at last month's
Senate Council meeting. W

Palous, a well-known freedom fighter, has been a political
activist in his homeland for more than 50 years. He took part
in the Prague revolution in 1945, which was successful in
forcing the German army to leave the city.

“Through his intellectual and moral leadership, Palous has
been a major contributor to peaceful restoration of democratic
government in Czechoslovakia. Throughout his life, he has
worked ardently and courageously for the causes of political
freedom and reform," Posvar said.

Palous was brieﬂy imprisoned in Czechoslovakia for his
outspoken opposition to the government. Much of his protest
centered on his philosophy of education. He is a member of a
Czechoslovakian organization that is working on reorganizing
the country's university system. ‘

Posvar said that one of the reasons that Palous was chosen
was because of the historic link that Pittsburgh has 1 to
Czechoslovakia. In 1918, Pittsburgh was the site of the signing
of an important agreement between Czech and Slovak
peoples.

“This brought together the Czech and Slovak people in the

Resume must say more than ‘references available on request’ ..

By Maria Perez
Staff Writer

Resumes and interviews are
essential for getting a job, but
there is more to it than listing
jobs and answering questions.

According to Robert Perkoski,
associate director of Pitt’s
placement service, there are three
things to keep in mind while
writing a resume.

First, students should
remember that potential
employees do not thoroughly
read resumes. Instead, they give
the resumes what Perkoski calls
“the 10—second scan.”

With that in mind, Perkoski
said it is important to adhere to a

A format so the employer can get a

quick idea of the person who is
applyingfor the job.

A resume should be limited to
one or two pages, and full
sentences shouldn’t be used. “Use
short, choppy phrases,” Perkoski
said.

Perkoski advises not to use

colored paper for a resume.

“Many students want their
resume to stand out by putting
their resumes on red or blue
paper," Perkoski said. “It stands
out for the wrong reason.”

White, off-white and cream-
colored paper keep resumes
businesslike and professional.

The education category will
tell employers where the
applicant went to school, honors
that person received and possibly
a sampling of courses indicating
skills.

When describing career
objectives, applicants should not
be vague. They should give the
company an idea of what they
want.

“Don’t say something like, ‘I’d
like a challenging position in
which I can use my skills,”’ said
Perkoski.

The work—experience category
comes next. Career experience is
an optional subcategory. In this
subcategory applicants can
include internships, practicum,

volunteer work and part-or full-
time work.

When describing a job, students
should use what Perkoski calls
“the action style. ” The action style
uses verbs that show skill and
include background, action and
results.

Instead of saying “wrote a
paper,” it is better to say “received
assignment, researched and
analyzed topic, wrote and finished
paper, received an A.”

In the activities section,
leadership positions need to be
described. It would also help to
briefly describe secret, honorary,
professional and community
organizations. Social
organizations such as sororities
and fraternities do not need an
explanation.

References should always be
listed as “available upon request.”
Do not list the references on the
resume itself.

One last category could be
very helpful for the applicant.
Selective programs, like

independent study, show
organizing and research skills.

Perkoski lists the following as
things to omit in resumes:
expected salaries, reasons for
leaving a previous job, personal
information or a picture of oneself.

“Many times we take the wrong
approach and write a biography,”
Perkoski said. “A resume is a
marketing tool that illustrates
skills.”

Perkoski said a perfect resume
cannot be written the first time.
He suggested that a person write
a resume and show it to other
people. Seniors can bring their
resumes to the placement office
for resume critiques.

The chance for the company to
actually get to know the applicant
is at the interview.

Charles Ebert, a staff member
for the placement center,
conducts seminars on interviews.

During the seminar, students
learn there is both professional
and personal preparation for the
interview.

THE PITT NEWS GRADUATION ISSUE, Tuesday, March 27, 1990

First, the applicant must know
the company. There are books
and pamphlets telling people
what the company is and how it
works. Students should be
informed so they ask only
intelligent questions later and get
a feel for what the company is

I looking for.

Through self-analysis, the
applicant must get to know
himself and become confident.

Applicants should know how
they are going to be an asset to
the company. One underlying
question throughout the interview
is “Can you ﬁt in?”

Dressing appropriately is
important because first
impressions often make the
difference. Ebert said that, for
men, a three-piece suit is not
necessary. A blue jacket and grey
slacks will do. Women do not
have to wear “amannish-style
suits.” If there is a question about
appropriate dress, Ebert suggests
scheduling an appointment with
a counselor at the placement
office.

According to Ebert, who
formerly conducted interviews
for Westinghouse, the critical
point is when the interviewer
calls the name of the applicant.
The person being interviewed
should smile, make eye contact,
offer a firm handshake, but
shouldn’t introduce himself
because the interviewer already
knows who he is.

When first entering the
interviewing room, there will be
some “small talk” to which ‘the
applicant should respond

positively. Ebert said the
interviewee should always act
interested.

After the introduction, the
interviewer will start asking the

applicant questions about his .

academic, professional and
personal background and
objectives.

Applicants should not have to
answer what Ebert calls “illegal
questions” about age, marital
status and sex. “I don’t think that
is an appropriate question,” is a
polite way for the interviewee to
refuse answering a question that
makes him uncomfortable.

Types of questions in an
interview are: Can you do the
job? Will you do the job? How
well do you “fit” into the company?
What was your greatest
achievement in college? Why
should we hire you?

Applicants should appear
ﬂexible with job locations. If the
interviewee prefers to stay in the
western Pennsylvania area, it
should be noted but not insisted
upon. The refusal to take a job
because of location could weigh
heavily against the applicant.

After about 15 to 20 minutes,
the interview turns from. the

. interviewer to the interviewee.

The person being interviewed
should ask intelligent questions.
For example, the applicantshould
ask how often and by whom
employee evaluations are given.
Also, asking questions about the
company will help the applicant.

Applicants should not ask
questions about salaries or
incentives to go back to school to
get a license or a degree.

It" is appropriate for the
applicant to have a set of questions
prepared for the interview. Ebert
said he was impressed when a
student pulled note cards out of
his jacket pocket. The student
should not carry a notebook to
write down the answers because
it interferes with the crucial eye
contact.

The interviewer cannot tell an
applicant if he has the job. He
might tell the person the company
will get in touch with him or her
within two weeks.

When the interview is over, the
applicant should get the
interviewer’s business card or
name and business title so as
thank—you letter can be written.
Even if the person does not get
the job, the interviewer deserves
to be thanked for the time he or
she took to talk to the person.

Later, the applicant might want
to write down impressions of the
interview. These impressions can
be included in the thank-you
letter or used by the applicant to
reﬂect on how well the interview
went.

ROTC grads feel   UncleSozm gives tbe edge

‘ By Mindy Boffemmyer

The Pitt News

Most graduating Pitt students
are faced with such decisions
as whether to go to graduate
school or to enter the work
force directly out of college.
But some of the members of
this year’s graduating class
made that decision four years
ago when they joined the
Reserve Officers’ Training
Corps. A

Starting in November, Cadet
Major Andrew Miscuk will
attend military intelligence
school before returning to
college for a master’s degree in
business administration. Then
his weekends will be booked
through 1998 due to service in
the Army Reserve. A

“There have been times when

everyone, Iguess, going through
college feels like ‘Why am I
doing this?’ But it's paid off,” he
said. A

Many senior ROTC students
agree with Miscuk. They feel
that the decision to join ROTC
paid off for them as well.

Cadet Executive Officer Terri
Garber will take the state board
examinations for nursing then
go to Texas in July for 10 weeks
of additional training. She will
then serve in the Army for three
years in Germany. Garber does
not regret the time she has
devoted to ROTC.

“For one thing, I’m going to
get out of the [United States] for
a while, which I wouldn’t have

V [ordinarily] been able to do,” she

said.
Cadet Captain Colleen Kelly,

also a nursing student, will serve
four years of active duty after
graduation. She then plans to
serve an additional four years
and to apply for the opportunity
to serve in Europe.

“You put in for what you want
and, if you’re lucky and they
have a‘ slot, you get to go,” she
said.

Kelly realizes the differences
between herself and other
nursing students and feels she is
at an advantage.

I "I think it’s one of the best
decisions I’ve ever made,” she
said. “I don’t have to worry about
finding a job. I already have a
job. I’ll get more responsibility
and more of a leadership role
than I would at a civilian
hospital.” ' .

She added that she believes
when she is finished with her-

military training, she will be
offered a better job with a higher
salary because of her
experience.

Graduating Cadetjohn Dudas
agrees that there are advantages
for ROTC students. q '

“I’m able to do more in the
way of service to my country
than average students, ” he said.

Dudas will serve in the Army

Reserve for eight years with the

479th ﬁeld—artillery brigade.
He is applying to public-
sector firms in the Washington,
D.C., area for work in computer
analysis. e

“A lot of -students have to

start from scratch in the business

world,” he said. “There’s
nothing like the experience in
management that the ROTC
gives you.”

Those interested in impressing an a
potential employer in an interview take
notice; natural ﬁbers, royal navy, stripes
and classic styling will highlight the fashion
scene this year, according to an area
fashion expert.

“Natural ﬁbers, cotton shirts, silk ties. In
the business world, the shades will be
light grays to charcoals and medium blues
to classic navies,” said Michael Daly, sales
manager at Richmond Brothers.

“The look is deﬁnitely more classic.
Trends will come and go, but the well-
dressed man will have a classic wardrobe,”

i he added.

Daly said that the three—button suit and
the six—button, double-breasted suit, both
reminiscent of the ’40s, will make a
comeback this year. Pleated. pants also
will remain a fashion item.

“All [of these styles] will be done in
fresh, new colors, using different highlight
colors,” Daly said. “Traditional glen plaids
will be highlighted with teal and lavender
[for] a more expressive look.”

Accessories will still play a big role in
women’s fashions, according to Daly. “A
lot of women’s clothing manufacturers
have already accessorized packages before
they get [to the stores]. This shows us that
they will be a big item.”

According to Women’s Wear Daily, a
leading fashion magazine, “[Manufacturers’
plans for 1990 include] creating new styles,
diversifying their product line and
enhancing production capabilities.”

In tailored women’s wear, WWD says,
“Two-piece dresses and jacket dresses,
designed in soft fabrics  short and sexy,”
will be in for the career woman. “Women
are moving away from dressing like men
at the office. [The look is] reﬁned without
being stuffy,” the "magazine says.

“At the dress division of Liz Claiborne,

the plan for 1990 features a casual-dress
program of washed knits and wovens,”
WWD says. “Textured cotton knits are the
most revolutionary looks.

“lChambrays and twills will be] styled
with a ’4Qs appeal in a variety of lengths,”
the magazine continues.

For fall, men will be wearing classic
wool-blend suits, according to WWD, and
women will be turning to clothing made
of “precious ﬁbers and blends; camel hair
in fancies, such as plaids, wool, mohair
and wool mixes; dimensional chevrons,
and plaids,” according to WWD.

The fall and winter colors for the ’90s
include clear reds, spice colors, and teals
and violets. These colors will be enhanced
by citron greens, curries, olives and
oranges, according to many leading fashion
experts.

Summer will also bring about several
waves, due to the nautical look which will
highlight the season for several
manufacturers.

According to Caryl Stein, publicity
director for Kaufmann’s department store,
“There are a lot of different looks that are
acceptable. It depends on where you
work. The shape is much softer. We’re
seeing pantsuits a lot more in the ofﬁce.”

Royal navy suits, which are of nautical
styling with crests and gold accents, are

very big in women’s fashions this season, ‘

according to Stein.

Desert shades, neutral tones, spice hues,
soft pastels and brights will all be popular
this season.’ “Orange is hot,” Stein said.
“Orange and yellow together. The classic
color of the season is black. The black suit
with a white blouse is always in.”

For the more casual ofﬁces, Stein said
that other hot items include transparent
skirts with long blazers worn over them;
split skirts; sarong skirts, which are
wrapped then knotted at the waist; city
shorts and walking shorts.

information.

Applying for insurance can be
difﬁcult, said Williams, because
many insurance companies won’t
take new business from ﬁrst-time
car owners. To get around this
problem, he recommends that
students try to get coverage
through their parents’ insurance
policies. By doing so, students
are also strategically keeping the
cost of their insurance down.

Another way to curb insurance
costs is to choose a more practical
vehicle. “More expensive cars,
the age and type of car all
determine the premium rate of
insurance,” Williams said.

ones where the work [is] tedious
though. [An internship] needs to
be something that can be
adequately evaluated. They are
almost essential in areas like
communications. ”

With all of the red tape of
finding a job, an often brighter
and sometimes even easier option
for ﬁnding a good job may be
graduate school.

Many students do opt for this
choice, saying that the likelihood
of a school accepting them seems
better than a company accepting
them for a job.

Often, mid-sized to larger
companies offer tuition beneﬁts
for employees to enter graduate
school while working for the
company, with one stipulation
being that selected courses must
coincide with the type of work
being done on the job.

Students continue to
contemplate both options,
according to Perkoski. Often,
experiencing the “real world” for
a while may help students to

  
 

decide between the two.

With each having different
needs, students will best be able
to decide themselves which
option to choose.

“It’s very competitive,” said
Perkoski. “On the one hand,
[looking for a job] may be a long
shot, but on the other hand, there

' are fairly large groups of students

being hired,” he added.

According to Perkoski,
whatever decision you choose,
you must start early.
Procrastination will get you
nowhere, either in applying to
graduate school or in looking for
a job.

“Most students get involved [in
the hiring process] six to nine
months before graduation,” said
Perkoski. “Many of those
graduating in April [are seen by
the placement center] in
September. Ifyou’ve waited until
after you graduate [to either look
for a job or apply to graduate
school], you’ve waited too long,”
added Perkoski."
