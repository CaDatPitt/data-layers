Long-Range Planning Stressed

By DAVE KIRSHNER

Possible preparations for Pitt’s
annual “budget suspense story”
and the University’s chances for a
higher state appropriation head-
lined, discussion at yesterday’s
meeting of the University Senate.

In his report on budget policy
decisions for ﬁscal year 1979, Prof.
Richard H. Pratt, chairman of the
University Senate budget policies
committee, stressed the need to
improve long-range budget plan-
ning in order to avoid yearly crises.

“We need a more realistic view of
this.” Pratt said. “We can’t say, ‘If

" ‘on get through this year, next year

--Wm be 0.K.’ "

-at  ‘

Chancellor Posvar related his
concern for current and future state
aid requests.

“There is little or no encourage-
ment about the present budget
situation,” Posvar told Senate
members. “During the recent
budget hearings in Harrisburg, I

Next year, the Chancellor said, a
new governor and a “political
honeymoon” in Harrisburg will
hopefully bring about a readjust-
ment in priorities and a subsequent
increase in funding.

Pratt said he isn’t counting on
that to happen, and suggested that
significant changes in program-
ming, which will require long-range
planning, be continued.

“We must take new initiatives, ’

and also pull back, give up on some
things,” he said. “Not a wholesale
closure, but a rearrangement of
programs.

“There should be an attempt to
understand future needs,” he
added. “The process must be
improved, so various units of the
University can understand the
situation.”

According to both Pratt and
Posvar, the University is ﬁscally
sound. . ’

“Nothing drastic is going to
happen overnight/V’ Pratt said after
the session, “but you will probably

Poor WPIC Patient

Charge Denied

By DAN ROSENTHAL

Pitt News Staff Writer
Charges of “impending crisis in the quality of patient care” at
Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic (WPIC) as a result of a
36-day-old strike there have been denied by the state agency that

licenses the hospital.

Several organizations supporting striking members of district 1199 »P
of the National Union of Hospital and Halth Care Employees told
reporters yesterday that WPIC patients are not getting quality care,

maintenance is deteriorating and food service inadequate.

Hospital

administrators maintain patient care is relatively normal despite the

strike of nearly 120 WPIC workers.

An anonymous letter to the Allegheny County Health Department
complaining of poor conditions at WPIC sparked a recent inspection at
the hospital. Walter Bennett, deputy commissioner of mental health,
western region, Department of Public Welfare, said the complaints were
“totally unsubstantiated by the investigation.”

‘gjéennett said charges are unfounded that Pitt, as operator of WPIC, is
sharing “a total disregard to the mental health care needs of the

community. ”

“If you take all the striking workers and spread their shifts out over a -
-24-hour day, it doesn’t make a whole lot of difference in terms of the
institution per shift. So it’s not surprising to me, that they (WPIC
administration) can maintain the faculty. The strike hasn’t gone on long
enough for anything that serious to crop up,” "Bennett said.

Vote Turnout

Expectations

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staffwriter
Tumouts for this week’s Student
Cabinet elections were “about as
expected,” John Hankey, co-chair-
man of the School of General

Studies Cabinet elections commit-

tee said last night.

Last-minute canvassing con-
tinued at the polls in the
ground-ﬂoor lobby of the Cathedral
and the ﬁrst ﬂoor of David
Lawrence Hall last night. In David
Lawrence, a U.S. Naval ﬁreman, in
dress uniform campaigned for his
brother, Kerry Clancy.

A swarm of candidates accosted
passersby in the Cathedral, asking,
“Excuse me, are you a General

asking them to vote for the
“Four-ce” candidate slate,—Deb-

State Lobbying Expenses Under Questioning

By The_ Associated Press

HARRISBURG—0nly 116 of
Pennsylvania’s 470 registered lob-
byists have ﬁled expense reports
with the legislature under a new
law that promised a behind-the-
scenes look at the way lobbyists
influence lawmakers, Common
Cause said yesterday.

The law, touted as the most
comprehensive lobbyist regulation
ever passed, “is loophole ridden,
ambiguously written and unen-
forced.” said Common Cause state
coordinator Jane Locke.

Among the missing are reports
from the state’s most powerful
interest groups: The Pennsylvania
State Education Association, the
American Federation of State
County and Municipal Employees
and the Chamber of Commerce,
she ‘said.

   

 

to cover just the lobbyists’ personal
living and business expenses.

Two of the biggest spenders
were Penn State University and
Pitt, both state-related schools.
Penn State lobbyist Frederick
Cilette spent $8,995.13 for meals
and entertainment during Septem-
ber, October and November.

Former state Sen. Thomas
Lamb, who represents Pitt, spent
$9,835 for football tickets, Common
Cause said.

The law requires lobbyists to ﬁle
semiannual reports about their
expenses if they spend more than
$300 a month on lobbying.

» Ofﬁcials from the employees
union and the chamber said they
didn’t spend the minimum $300 in

. any month. ,
 %*_wedwn’t.mt 530% wt  

 

believe most people do,” said Don
Gillis, chamber vice president and
lobbyist.

Gerald McEntee, AFSCME ex-
ecutive director, cited the same
reason for not ﬁling.

For the most part, Gillis said,
lobbyists who spend more than
$300 a month represent trade
associations and other large groups
that throw big legislative dinners.

Various chamber committees will
sometimes take lawmakers to
dinner but the individual business-
men present pick up the tab for
individual lawmakers, he said.

Thebusinessmen aren’t trying to
circumvent the law, he added.
“We just don’t have a budget for
lavish entertainment,” he said.

Most lobbyist have complained
-the law is vague and badly worded.
 have said they’re not sure

who must register or if a report is
required if the $300 minimum is
met in only one month of the year.

Senate Secretary Mark Gruell,
who administers the system, tried
to clear'up the confusion last year
with a set of guidelines. But he was
accused of going beyond his
powers and the guidelines were
withdrawn. '

Common Cause said other
states, including California and
New York, have much tougher laws
requiring reports on lobbyists’
salaries, ofﬁce expense and legisla-
tion being pushed.

“Common Cause believes that
the law is being consciously
violated but that there is no way to
prove a violation except to ask the
particular lobbyist how much he is

spending, ’’ said tvIs;~Locke. _

Miners Vote Today
By_ The Associated Press

After 108 days in which they deﬁed their bosses, their union
leadership and the President of the United States, 160,000 United
Mine Workers vote today on whether to end the nationwide coal
strike.

Few in the coalﬁelds are willing to say with conﬁdence which way
these independent-minded union members will vote.

Many miners say they are resigned to a less-than-perfect

settlement. But just as many may want to stick it out for a contract '

they like.

The UMW has a long history of contentiousness, and already, this
has been the longest nationwide strike in its history.

It has cut national coal production in half. It has prompted power
cutbacks and, the Labor Department has reported thousands of
layoffs throughout the Midwest and East—some 23,000 factory
workers in each of the last two weeks. "

Negotiators have reached two previous contract agreements, only
to see them torpedoed——the first by the UMW bargaining council,
the second by the rank and ﬁle.

When the second pact lost, President Carter invoked the
Taft-Hartley Act and a court ordered the miners back to work.‘ But
virtually none went and, last Friday, the judge refused to renew the
order. ;

Negotiators, meanwhile, reached a third agreement and sent it to
the coal ﬁelds this week. After three days of brieﬁngs, Thursday
was set aside for the membership to mull it over in private.

And a nervous quiet settled over the coalfields.

Although the contract would raise pay by nearly one-third, from
an average $7.80 an hour to $10.20 over three years, many miners
don’t like its failure to retain the fully paid, independent health care
coverage they-are used to.

Nuclear Fallout Dectected Over Pa.

By The Associated Press -

HARRISBURG—The state has detected fallout from a March 15
nuclear test over China in air samples in Harrisburg and Pittsburgh,
the Department of Environmental Resources said yesterday.

Radioactivity measured eight picocuries per cubic meter at
Harrisburg and llat Pittsburgh, said Thomas Gerusky, director of
the Bureau of Radiological Health. The normal reading is about
one.

Gerusky said the state will start sampling raw milk today at
selected farms. He said he doesn’t expect to ﬁnd any problems
because most cows’ are still feeding on stored "grain.

U.N.- Peacekeepers Set in Lebanon

By The Associated Press

BEIRUT, Lebanon—\I‘he United Nations raised its ﬂag yesterday
near the Litani River and prepared to carve out a buffer zone
between invading Israeli forces and Palestinian guerrillas in south
Lebanon.

Only sporadic violations of a two-day-old truce were reported in
the war-torn area, but a battle of bureaucrats loomed over
emergency aid for tens of thousands of refugees who have streamed
here from thesouth since Israel launched the invasion March 15.

The Palestine Liberation Organization said the Lebanese
government was withholding aid from Palestinian refugees, and the
United Nations appealed for urgent international help for the
Palestinians. .

Beirut state radio said a 120-man Iranian U.N. peacekeeping unit
transferred from the near-by Golan Heights buffer zone set up
outposts on both sides of the Litani River, which is 15 miles north of
and parallel to the Israeli-Lebanese border.

Associated Press correspondent Larry Thorson reported from
Metulla, in Israel’s northeast corner, that another convoy of Iranian
peacekeepers and Irish ofﬁcers heading for south Lebanon was
delayed for about an hour Thursday by Lebanese Christian children
who blocked the road at a border crossing.

Under coaching from Christian militiamen, the children sat on the
roadway and chanted “We want Israell” Southern Lebanon’s
Christians, who have battled the Palestinians and are friendly with
Israel, fear that a U.N. force will be unable to protect them against
guerrillas returning to the area, and they want the Israelis to stav.

 
 

Students Given Hypertension Tests

\

By TOM RICCI

More than 500 persons in the Pitt
community have participated in the
free blood pressure screening
drive, which is sponsored by Pitt's
Student Health Service, and runs
from March 20-30 in the Student
Union Lobby.

The drive introduced a new
electronic testing machine that is
similar to those found in neighbor-

hood shopping malls. One’s blood.

pressure is determined by inserting
an arm into the apparatus, and
within a minute, the pressure is
displayed in digital form.

During the first three days of the
drive, students, faculty and staff
have been tested. According to
Student Health educator Bob
LaCivita, the Health Service was
surprised at the large turnout, but
expressed ho_p<_e_ that more students‘

1'-,\~

will take advantage of the service in
the remaining days.

Figures by the American Heart
Association show that one out of
every six Americans have high
blood pressure (hypertension), and
so far, the data from this drive
suggests the same incident of
hypertension at Pitt. .

LaCivita said 90 percent of the
time, the causes of hypertension are

not known, and that heredity, salt

intake, weight, smoking and stresss
are all factors in inﬂuencing
hypertension. The other 10 percent -
are related to physical factors, such
as tumors.

Most people do not know what
their pressure is. Of those who have '
it taken, however, there are a few
who are not surprised at the result if
it is found high.

When the pressure is taken, no
diagnosis is made, mainly because

v -91'.‘

Fndéy, March 24, 19“7s’.;1%1ii;5ii$1rr NEWS-‘—Page 3

factors can escalate the reading,
such as anxiety, onlookers or recent
physical activity. '

If a reading is suspected to be-

high at ﬁrst (more than 160/195),
the person is asked to come back
later. When a total of four tests
show high readings, that person is
referred to his family doctor or to
the Health Service if they are a
student.

“High blood pressure is very‘

common among college students,
and it is very unfortunate since
there are no symptoms,” said Dr.
Joanne Robinson, Health Service
director. “The purpose of the drive

is to make people aware of their

blood pressure, so they can take the
necessary precautions now ‘to
prevent complications that high
blood pressure may cause in
the future, such as stroke or heart
disease.”

“72 Years of Collegiate Joumalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

 p No Easter Vacation

Yesterday, the first of a flood of students began trickling from

r the campus. With suitcase and duffel bag in hand, students stand

at the top of the Towers’ steps waiting for their ride. In the Forbes
Quadrangle, bags are thrown into a car and six people crowd in,

ready for their Easter vacation.-,

These are the more fortunate; the ones who can afford to miss a
few days of classes or do not have to travel far to their homes.
Forgotten are the students not from Western Pennsylvania who
cannot afford to miss a few days of classes, who find they are trap-
ped in Pittsburgh for the Easter holidays, apart from their families.
They find leaving here Friday afternoon, traveling five hours and
then rushing back Sunday, when added to the time needed to study
for upcoming exams, too taxing. -As a result these students are
forced to spend a lonely weekend at Pitt.

‘Last year, Easter vacation was unnecessary since Good Friday‘

fell on the last day of regular classes, but this year Easter is early
and students are made to suffer for it. No Easter vacation allows
the winter term to finish at the correct time so that Spring Term
begins on schedule. Smooth functioning of the school, though a
laudable goal at times, seems carried to an extreme in this case, and

the students suffer.

Besides giving students far from home a chance to see their
families at Easter, a short vacation of two or three days would
benefit all students. It would offer them time to catch up on their

Towers Death Coverage Criticized

I am writing in reference to the
article, written by Rodney B.
Griffith, about the death of Earl
Saunders. Iwas very upset that the
article’s headline stated that the
death was due to suicide. The origin
of this claim was not explained in
the article, and no evidence was
presented to substantiate it. The
city police detective did not suggest
it, and, as of Monday night, the
coroner had not determined the
cause of death. Even the questioned
acquaintances of Earl Saunders did
not believe it was suicide. And I
know that the cause of death will not
point to intentional suicide. —

Perhaps some are wondering who
I am to make such a brash
statement. I am Earl’s girlfriend. I
have known Earl for two years and
we were very, very close. We

Opinions on Middle East Sophomoric

Mark Murphyis article on the
Israelis and Palestinians betrays a
sophomoric understanding of a
complex problem. One hardly

knows where to begin instruction’

when the gulf of ignorance is so
vast. It, is difficult to convey the
folly of linking a seriesiof popular
cliches into a disjointed analysis of
the Middle East, but let us try.
Start with the PLO “terrorists”
who “knew what the consequences
of any attack would be. Did it ever
occur to Murphy that dying for your
cause can appear to be a better
alternative to living in the squalor
and misery of a refugee camp? It’s
not easy for the western mind to
emphasize with poin of view alien
to their experience. But before one
pontificates "as to what the
Palestinians should or should not
do, he should take a short journey
in their shoes. Maybe then he
would begin to understand what 30

years of deprivation does to a
person.

=.What recourse is left to those
who waited in vain the first 20
years for the world’s conscience to
catch up to itself? They have
decided, for the last 10 years, to
wage war any way they can to gain
attention for their plight.

If Murphy thinks the Israelis will
give the Palestinians a homeland if
they stop their little war, he
believes in a fairyland contrary to
everything Zionism stands for. The
refugees got nothing when they
were quiescent and while Israel
was expanding its borders, killing,
deporting and repressing the
indiginous population, the Pales-
tinians were told to behave
themselves and not to do unto
others as was done to them.

The Palestinian freedom fighter
sees nothing wrong in the way he
wages war when compared to what

is done to him by Israeli artillery,
rockets and jet planes. The only
difference he sees between the
institutionalized, indiscriminate
killing of men, women and children
by the hundreds in the refugee
camps, and a few Israelis in a
desperation, headline-grabbing at-
tack in Israel, is in the numbers
killed.

Are we to believe, as instructed
by the media, that only Israelis
mourn their dead? Should we
succumb to the racist philosophy
that the Arabs are a subhuman
rabble and a few hundred more or
less is of no consequence‘? Should
we buy the contorted view that
Begin's revenge is sacred while
Arafat’s is bloody? Is an Israeli eye
worth 1,000 Arab eyes?

Underneath the cavalier treat-
ment of this subject matter lies
culpable, if not invincible, igno-
rance. An understanding of the
Palestinians requires study beyond
the headlines in the Pittsburgh
Press and two minute summaries
on the 6 o'clock news.

normally saw each other, and talked I

quite often during the week. So I
think I perhaps know a little more
about Earl’s state of mind than an
adviser who had seen him more
than a week or a month ago. In fact,
I would even go so far as to say that I
understood him a little more than a
neighbor who talked to him ‘for

maybe 10 minutes every few days.

The last time I saw Earl was the
Tuesday night before he died. He
stopped by to wish me luck on a test
I had the next day. We discussed
our plans for Wednesday and
Saturday nights. Being Engin-
eering Week, the pressure of his
own work was off, and he was able
to relax a little. Just as I, he too was
looking forward to attending the
Engineering Ball on Saturday night.

It was true that Earl had been
taking sleeping pills, but that was
the only medication or pills of any
type he had been using. He’d been
taking these for a while and he
didn’t even have many left. I also
know that some personal objects,
indicating his intentions for the
weekend, were found in his room.

As for the statement that no one
“kept close tabs” on Earl, that may
have been true of his neighbors. But
both his grandmother and Italked to
him often during the week. He
wasn’t found earlier, because we.
assumed he had gotten involved
with the\Engineering Week activ-
ities, and, therefore, wasn’t around

to answer the phone or call us. It I

was unlike him, but in that

situation, we convinced ourselves
that there was a simple explanation
for his absence.

On Thursday, we became very
worried when Earl still did not
answer the phone. So Icalled a good

"friend of his"and mine who lived on

his ﬂoor. He went to his resident
assistant, while I went to mine. The
area coordinator was called, and the ,
rest is rather well publicized.

All the things I have stated, I
relate from personal experience or
contact with the family. Also, Earl’s
good friend that I called was there at
the time. So I believe that from the
information I have presented, it is '
clear that Earl did not commit
suicide intentionally.

Perhaps some feel that I am being
unfair in singling out The Pitt News.

I know that other news media have ‘. 

made similar claims about Earl’s
death, but I feel The Pitt News has
responsibilities to those on campus
extending beyond those of com-
mercial radio stations, newspapers,
etc.

There were many people, both on
and off campus, who were affected
by the aforementioned article.
Because I do not know which reports
said what, I cannot make other
rebuttals. However, if I did know, I
would certainly write or call every
one of them to clear up the story.

In closing, I must suggest that if
Griffith is considering a career in

_ journalism, he go to better sources ,

for information, and also substa
tiate his headlines with more fact .

Easter Offers Time to Reflect on World’s State

By MARK MURPHY

Sunday is Easter, the holiday
Christians around the world cele-
brate to mark the resurrection of
Jesus. Although Easter is a
religious occasion commemorating
the most important event in Jesus’
life, its treatment is relaxed; it

onever arouses the feelings felt at
Christmas.

To be sure, the electricity at
Christmas may come from the
material aspect of the occasion. Yet
it seems there is an excitement that
permeates the air during middle
and late December. One does not

sense a comparable dynamic/

delight at Easter. And that is very
sad.

Easter, and the entire week that
precedes it, can be used as the
religious, truly religious, alterna-
tive to the Madison Avenue hardsell
of Christmas cheer. Although this

alniversity does not see ﬁt to respect
the rights and privileges of the
devout in its midst, consider this a

request, a plea if you will, to use
this time wisely and think about and
reﬂect on the events of our world.

Where should secularism begin
and end, if it should exist at all?
How can we control this idea and
keep it from becoming the
dominating belief in our lives?
People must believe, even if it is in
their own non-belief. But people
must take care to ensure their
beliefs or non-beliefs do not over
step boundaries and spread to
uninvited areas.

This is not a pitch for everyone to
become religious; indeed, I am not a
religious person in the formal
sense, and often struggle with
myself over belief in a God. But the
trend, perhaps just a well-publi-
cized movement, toward secularism
is one I find difﬁcult to grasp.

This is not to say that one should
not allow one’s, say, political beliefs
or theories to hinge on his religious
tenets. On the contrary, a mix of
politics and religion might be the
cure for some of the legislative and

electoral ills now present in our
country and the world. But the
greatest good must be achieved for
the greatest number, and if
religious or secular beliefs prevent
that from happening, they must
give way to the proper course.

We all heard a good deal during
the 1976 Presidential election about

PERSUA SIONS

entire week that
precedes it, can be
used as the religious,

alternative to the
Madison Avenue
hardsell of Christ-
mas cheer.

candidate Jimmy Carter and his
wearing religion on his sleeve.
Could Carter as President do what
was in the best interests of this

country even if it went against his
religious beliefs? Now that he is
President, Carter would have to
forego his religious feelings if the
interests of America would conﬂict
with them. If he could not do that he
should not be in office.

One would hope it never has to
come to such a decision, but it may,
and we should all be ready to deal
with it. Secularism of this kind
should exist and must exist if our
government is to beneﬁt the
greatest amount of people.

Taking the problem one step

A further, can we survive with total

secular thought? But we need
religious beliefs, some sort of trust
in a benevolent God, to help us
through and understand our world?
We look around and see war in the
Horn of Africa and the Middle East
raging in a conﬂict with no

remembered beginning and no‘

apparent end. Apartheid continues
to ﬂourish in South Africa, and
oppressive regimes stiﬂe freedom
in many countries around the world.
In our own country, we no longer

pray in public schools, respect for
people and property is at an
appaling low, and countless lives
continue to be swept away through
the horrid act of abortion.

These are moral ills, sicknesses
that no secular force among us is
going to help or cure. Perhaps that
is the greatest difference between
secular and religious beliefs.
Secular thought works very nicely
where ethics, particularly situation-
al ethics, are used. For the moral
issues, the ideas that are most
important to our well-being and
continued existence, it is religious
thought and action that will make
the difference.

People should use this time to
come to grips with what they believe
to be the right course forsolving our
problems and increasing and using
our natural wealth. But it should be
remembered that when religious
thought was shoved aside and
neutered in favor of secular
inﬂuence, our problems began.
When the situation is reversed, our
problems may begin to diminish.

ByPEI'ERWENTZEL

The ﬁlm version of Harold
Robbins’s best-seller “The Betsy”
is a disappointment. In spite of an
excellent cast and an original story
concept, the movie doesn’t come
near becoming the ﬁne ﬁlm it could
have been.

It is instead a two hour soap
opera, a cross between “The Great
Gatsby,” “The Godfather” and
“The Other Side of Midnight.”

This saga of several generations
of Hardeman automobile tycoons is
reminiscent of the Corleone family
in “The Godfather.” Both involve a
power struggle between the ruth-
less men of the family.

The conﬂict in “The Betsy” is
between the eldest, Loren Harde-

man (Laurence Olivier) and his

grandson (Robert Duvall).

Olivier decides that he wants his
Bethelem Motoring Company to
produce the “universal car” in the
spirit of Ford’s Model T and
Hitler’s Volkswagen. It is to be

named “The Betsy” after his
granddaughter (Kathleen Beller).
Duvall, because of an intense
loathing of his grandfather, op-
poses the idea.

Olivier’s protege, ex-racing drive
driver Angelo Perino (Tommy Lee
Jones), is hired to develop the
Betsy but winds up joining the
battle with his own aspirations in
mind.

As a result of this conﬂict, there
are both classic and imaginative
new modes of murder, including
Capone-style machine guns, 20-
story falls, and the all-new
garroting-by-power-window.

Flashbacks to the early 1930's
recall Gatsby-esque images of
lavish parties in awe-inspiring
mansions surrounded by acres of
gardens and pools. The costumes
and sets in these scenes are
overwhelmingly opulent. Comple-
menting the visual concept is a
beautiful score by John Barry. He
uses a clever trick during the first
ﬂashback: as the ﬁlm fades from

present to past, the music
simultaneously ﬂows from con-
temporary to swing.

But it is “The Other Side of
Midnight” that “The Betsy” most
resembles. Both are soap operas on
a grand and raunchy scale.

Flashbacks prove that Hardeman
I is a loose guy. He is ﬁrst seen
cavorting with the French maid,‘

ARTS

then sleeping with his daughter-in-
law (Katherine Ross), whose
-husband (Paul Rudd) is having a
ﬂing with another man. Back to the
present, Hardeman III is seeking a
divorce from Alicia (Jane Alexan-
der) because she knows he is
having an affair with Lady Ayres
(Lesley-Anne Downe), who is also
sleeping with Perino, who ends up

in the sack with Betsy on her 21st
birthday.

And, like “Midnight,” one spicy
love scene after another leads to
hilarity as the audience begins to
wonder who’s next. At least the
lovers save us from the prelimi-
naries like “This is the living room,
this is the dining room, this is the
bedroom, this is the boy, this is the
girl...,” practiced by the stud in
“Midnight. ’ ’

Beller is at home in the soap
opera format after playing Liza in
television’s “Search for Tomor-
row” for several years. She is a
mature actress for her age, and she
handles the role of “the girl who
has everything” well. But it is hard
to understand why she doesn’t get
excited when she is told that a car
is to be named after her and that
she is to receive 50 percent of the
stock in Bethelem Motors.

Duvall, as her father, has ﬁnally‘

been ‘given a role worthy of his
abilities. Until now he has played
relatively ﬂat characters, but in

“The Betsy” he easily becomes the
man who is the omnipotent
presidsent of a corporation and at
the same time leads a tormented
personal life.

The saddest fact of this ﬁlm is
that a great actor like Sir Laurence
Olivier has cheapened himself by
playing the lecherous old founding
father in this third-rate movie. The
explicit scene in which he copulates
with the maid is a disgrace to a

Ross, Alexander, Rudd and Ed-

perfection, giving rise to further
confusion about what such talented

At any rate, “The Betsy” will

an expensive adaptation of a
pornographic novel in the grand
tradition of pure camp.

‘Crash of ’7 9 ’-- Little Fact and A Lot of Fiction

By LARRY LUNSFORD

The Crash of ’79
Paul E. Erdman
Pocket Books

A reviewer for Time magazine
wrote about “The Crash of ’79”:
“What sets the book apart from
other current best-sellers is its
eerie believability. ’ ’ Unfortunately,
the comment is true. Paul E.
Erdman’s tale of world economic
failure and war in the Middle East

is a haunting epic that could,

become reality even before 1979.

Had it not been for the Middle
East storyline in the novel,
Erdman’s work might have been a
waste, in that his run-on-the-banks
motif is too similar to Arthur
Haley’s “The Moneychangers” to
have become a success by itself.
However, the book combines a

. little fact with a lot of ﬁction to

create a lurid, scary account of
power- and money-hungry people
and governments.

’ The main character is one Dr.

in the world,

William Hitchcock, a middle-aged
Casanova who made his millions as
a successful Big Apple banker,
retired before he lost his money,
divorced his wife and then accepted
an unlikely appointment as chief
ﬁnancial adviser to the Govern-
ment of Saudi Arabia.

Safe, remarried and living rich in
Switzerland’s beautiful St. Moritz
in 1984, Hitchcock begins the novel
in the ﬁrst person, reﬂecting back
on how the world fell apart.

It all began as Hitchcock
assumed his position with the
Saudis under King Khalid. The
Saudis realized that they were
literally being taken for millions of
dollars by practically every country
and they hired
Hitchcock to alleviate their ﬁnan-
cial woes. He did—at the expense
of the big banks in London, Zurich,
Frankfurt, Paris and New York.

Italy was also defaulting on‘

millions in loans, and our banking
genius steps in to arrange a
swindle, whereby Italy’s largest
national oil company would be

taken over and all loans guaran-
teed.

The stage is setfor the crash.

“Had I known what was going on
in Teheran that week, I would
hardly have gone to Rome,” said
Hitchcock. “In fact, I would have
gone right back to California and
gotten drunk.” He soon had
Europe clinging at his feet. He was
surrounded by delegations of
bowing and scraping Japanese,
desperate for Iran’s petroleum. He
was courted by Richard Helms,
praised by Giscard D’Estaing,
embraced by Harold Wilson,
sumptuously entertained by Gerald
Ford. His utterances were carefully
documented by C.L. Sulzberger
(with reserve), by William Hearst
(with enthusiasm), by Time maga-
zine (with pictures).”

It was the Shah’s intent to take
over the entire Persian Gulf as well
as all the oil ﬁelds in the Middle
East. Part Two of the crash. He
secured the services of Herr
Professor Hartmann, nuclear phy-
sicist with Eidgenoessische Tech-

nische Hochschule in Zurich, which
was run by the Swiss government,
to build Iran’s first nuclear
weapons. Switzerland had to let the
good professor go because the
Shah had learned that the Swiss,
signers of the nuclear nonprolifera-
tion treaty after World War 11, did
in fact have their own secret
nuclear weapons. In return for
Hartmann, the Shah would main-
tain the Swiss secret.

Enter the professor's daughter,
Ursula, who just happened to meet
Dr. Hitchcock in a bar in Rome, and
a budding romance began. they
carry on a long-distance courtship
which later ends in marriage (for
convenience only) following the
crash.

The crash of ’79 unfolds. The
United States double-crossed its
allies and made an oil deal with the
Saudis in return for all the Saudi
banking interest. The allies sided
with Iran. A coup erupted in Saudia
Arabia and anti-American Crown
Princ Fahd took command. The
money was pulled out. A run on the
banks occured. At the same time,
the Four Day War began, and the

Shah was succeeding. All that
remained to be taken were the
Ghawar Oil Fields. 4

King Khalid resumed control of
his country and teamed with
Colonel Quaddaﬁ of Libya, and in
came the United States to the
rescue with men and bombs;
however, it was too late. The
madman Shah had already dropped
six nuclear bombs which utilized
cobalt as the contamination agent
on the oil ﬁelds. A retaliation attack
destroyed Iran’s city of Khorram-'
shahr and its King of Kings.

The Arab world was in shambles.
Israel, ignored throughout the
entire ﬁasco, was the only real
winner. Back in the United States,
the total money supply had been
artiﬁcially increased by printing
new money in the amount of $250
billion. The result was hyperinﬂa-
tion—ﬁnancial and physical ruin.

The novel is detailed and often
bogs down in complicated pass-
ages, but its eerie reality focuses
on two current crisis very much in
the news. Money and power in the
wrong hands can write the end to
the good planet earth.

Hoo Doo Rhythm Devils A F irst-Rate Band

The HooDoo Rhthym Deviis may be one of the best unsung groups around,

despite that name.

 

 

By TERRI vocr
Pitt News Staff Writer
All Kidding Aside
Hoo Doo Rhythm Devils

After splitting up for a second
time in 1975, the H00 Doo Rhythm

i Devils are back, and consequently

have gotten their act together.
Suitably titled “A1l Kidding
Aside,” the H00 Doo’s latest album
features a strong, earthy, David
Clayton-Thomas lead vocal "sound
from both Joe Crane and Glenn
Walters.

Side one begins with the classic
“Workin’ in a Coal Mine,” which
has also been released as a single.
This tune is done much like the
original, but supplemented with a
southern honky-tonk beat. Crane, a
native of Texas, knows that
southern type of rhythm and blues
intimately, and he lets it shine
through his compositions.

Crane has struck gold with such
originals as “Poison,” which
delivers great keyboards, and “All
Night." which has a steady guitar
background.“

"Sweet City Street” offers a
southern strut with strong vocals
and bass. The orchestra section

-*“‘?*‘*“**‘?',.?i."F’ i‘fi¥*S°1¢ Shears Hows-

made up of top-notch local Alabama
musicians.

A slower cut, but still dance
material, “Gotta Lot of Love in My
Soul’’ is reminiscent of Boz
Scaggs’s type of orchestrated rock
’n’ roll.

Said to boast two of the most
soulful singers in the business, the
Hoo Doo’s certainly put forth their
best effort in that direction with “I
Had a Fight with Love (And I
Lost).’’

Never losing that hint of a
jitterbug in their background, the
H00 Doo Rhythm Devils present the
raunchy southern ﬂavor of rock on
which they were built. The slow
drag beat of “Teen Tang” and a
ballad, “Cross Roads,” also help
this group to take that hard ﬁrst step
to national recognition.

“Far From Over” and “Correc-
tion in Your Direction” complete
the album with a remembrance of
the Creedence Clearwater era.

All in all, this could very well be

the album that lifts the H00 Doo
Rhythm Devils to the level they

have wanted since the late 19603.

Deﬁnitely a great ﬁnd for the person
th ei r

who prides himself in
. little-k.nown group di,scoveries. p

By KAREN KADILAK
pm News sun Writer:
You would think there would be a
world of diﬁerence between the

‘swimmers who compete in the

Olympics and those who compete in
the NCAA Championships, but,
according to Pitt swimmer and
Olympic veteran Orlando Catinchi,
the difference isn’t as great as you
might like to think it is.

Pitt News Staff Writer

Arkansas is the next team to try
its hand at knocking off top-ranked
Kentucky in the ﬁrst of two NCAA
semiﬁnal games tomorrow at the
Checkerdome in St. Louis.

In the Wildcats’ first tournament
game against Florida State Some
two weeks ago, experts-predicted
that the Seminoles’ quickness
would give Kentucky trouble. For
little more than 30 minutes, Florida
State ran by and around the
Wildcats, but superior depth and
talent eventually won out over
determination, and Kentucky pre-
vailed, 85-76.

The Hogs will .« be a more

formidable version of Florida State, A

and Wildcat coach Joe B. Hall has
openly expressed concern over
Arkansas’s quickness.

“I would expect Eddie Sutton

(Arkansas coach) to employ the

things his team does best,” Hall

said, “and I also feel like thereare .

things that are effective against his
club that our people aren’t capable
of doing.”

“Quickness has been a problem
for us,” Hall said. “We usually
make a substitution when we need

Championships and the Olympics.

“You have to prove yourself in
the NCAA’s, just like you do in the
Olympics, or any other meet for that
matter,” he explained. “I have to
admit that I’ve never been psyched
for a meet like I was for the
Olympics, but that doesn’t mean I
won’t be psyched for this meet. It
may not be the Olympics, where
you’re competing against the world,
but it’s an important meet just the
same. You have to be prepared to do
well.”

Catinchi, who ﬁnished 17th in the
200-meter breastroke at the Olym-

pics, will swim breastroke on the
400-yard medley relay team. It will
be the third straight year he's
competed in the event at the
NCAAs.

I’m looking forward to making;
all-America,’ ’ Catinchi said. ‘ ‘None
of the other two teams (400-yard
medley relay) made all-America. It
would be nice to make it this time

around.” _
“After the NCAA’s and school’s

over, I'm going to get ready for the
Latin Cup. It’s a meet the Latin
countries have every year. This year
it’s goingto be in Acalpulco. Last

year ‘it was in Rome. It’s an
important meet for Puerto Rico. We
did welllast year and I’m hoping we
can do well this year.

“Then after that, it’s off-to
the__AAU Nationals,” continued
Catinchi, noting that he has
qualiﬁed to swim in the 200-yard
breastroke in that meet. “The
Olympics are two years away. I hope
to graduate in 1979. I’d like to go to
school after that and become a
vetenarian. I'll have to see how
things turn out before I decide
whether I want to swim in the
Olympics or not.”

“We felt that last year 0111'

have advanced farther than it did, ’ ’
said Sutton. “We have.a good
basketball team, and a bunch of
young men who believe in
_thenfsel_ves.’

A The second semiﬁnal (Duke
versus Notre Dame) will match two
teams that dispel the common
notion that experience is necessary
to be successful in the NCAA’s
lucrative version of king-of-the-hill.

Duke has improved its record of
one year ago, 14-13, to 26-6 with a
starting lineup of two freshmen,
two sophomores and one junior.

The Blue Devil ﬁve of Jim
Spanarkel, Mike Gminski, Gene

Banks, Kenny Dennard and John
Harrell are playing above their
tender years, and coach Bill Foster
doesn’t expect his squad to wilt

, under the scrutiny of a nationwide
- audience.

“We’ve (matured, and we're
playing with maturity as far as

_freshiiien, -sophomores and juniors
» - are concerned,” Foster said. “I’m

hopeful ‘we can continue that. ‘I
don’t look at us as a young team.”
_Notre Dame, although not as
green a_s Duke, having two seniors
in the starting ‘five, has been led
by freshman Kelly Tripucka
throughout the tournament.

Tripucka, who carried an

average of 11.7 points and 5.1
rebounds during the regular seaon,
is. leading the Irish in scoring
during the second season with a
17.3 average. Tripucka, with an
inside game reminiscent of Adrian
Dantley, will be a major concern for
the Blue Devils, who ended a
10-year drought by winning this
year’s ACC tournament.

The Irish, playing as ﬁne a brand
of basketball as they have all year,
boast four starters (Dave Batton,
Duck Williams, Rich Branning and
Tripucka) and
Laimbeer in double ﬁgures during
the tournament,

Notre Dame coach Digger
Phelps, who said that reaching the

ﬁnal four was his goal and anything

else would be gravy, still maintains
he isn’t thinking of a national
championship.

“We’ve got to play for the
moment,” Phelps said. “We’re not
thinking of the national champion-

ship. We’re just thinking of
Duke.”
