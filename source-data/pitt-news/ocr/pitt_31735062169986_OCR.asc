Contact lenses were de-

they are up to a point. They're
convenient enough to wear,
once you get used to them, but,
 until recently, you had to use
two or more different tens solu-

maintain contacts. You
needed two or three differ-
ent bottles, tens cases, and
you went through more than
enough daily rituals to make
even the most steadfast indi-
viduals consider dropping out.
But now caring for your con-

wearing them. Now there's Len-

It does not imply pulling back
from life. feeling secure. or fol-
lowing a set of rules. It involves
loving God. and loving your
neighbor. Rev. Dunderdale does-
n't want "a religion that takes me
from life and binds me with rules
Ican‘t question."

As Christians, believers in
Christ, people must be concerned
about and learn to love other peo-
ple. Thisphase of the Christian
relationship is particularly dif-
ficult to achieve. In learning to
love other people one becomes
vulnerable to the hurt that is en-
evitable in human relations.

Rev. Dunderdale contends that
man is God's primary concern and
thus our fellow man must be our
primary concern.

A relationship with Christ is an
individual thing. This relationship
is a wedding of reason and emo-
tion.

According to Dunderdale. "We

are afraid and ashamed to show
emotions — anger. hate. love. We

Religion

must get over this. and show emo-
tion in church." These emotions
must solve today’s problems. such
as racism. Intellect hasn‘t help-
ed in the past. You just can’t rea-
son people out of fear or hate.
We‘ve sat and cried too long. It
doesn't do any good. As Rev. Dun-
“Emotion

Christ is strong enough."

These programs will be the last
of the year-long series on sex and
sexuality. They will focus on the
self-concepts and life styles that
have been imposed on the sexes
by the rigid view that sex roles
follow biologically determined
lines. Taking various vantage
points — psychological. social and

historical -— the panelists will lay .

the ground work for a reevalua-
tion of the male-female relation-
ship. They will explore the kinds
of qualitative changes that our
rapidly changing society demands
of marital and pre-marital rela-

' * "Although many of the members
of the Student Affairs Committee
" were attending their first meet-
ing. they were pleasantly sur-
"prised to see seven Univei-‘*'sity
"Trustees. six administrators and
.fsev.eral members of the facult_y
, join them for the luncheon meet-
ing on Monday.

, -The tone of the meeting was
set early when Chancellor Wes-
 . .ley Posvar and his associates in-
 troduced themselves and the other
 ' guests to the .students and encour-
 ’-‘aged everyone to discuss anything
 that they felt would be relevant
 to the current problems at the
. ‘University.
j After_~the luncheon. reports
iwere given about future Univer-
-r:—ff sity expansion. Both John Vrana.
2 assistant dean of Student Affairs.
I and Jack Critchfield. dean of Stu-
dent Affairs. stressed the role stu-
dents have played in the planning
and first-draft drawings of the
.'new dormitories and a new stu-
’ ldent union building. -

  
 
   
 

The Chancellor then gave a
brief description of the role of
- the Trustees, the administration,

the faculty, the students and the
 responsibility they have to the
 "University and the community,
}~~.“after which questions were rais-
7 ed by the students. Most of these

‘questions were directed toward
the Trustees.

' In response to a question about
-student or community represen-
_‘tation on the Board of Trustees.
“John Heinz. one of the newer
"members of the Board suggested
tthat students or members of the
_ community could sit on various
 "committees with-the Trustees and
I.7yvork with them in specific proj-
<‘ects. This suggestion received fav-
orable response from the rest of
“the group. .

of the Board would not be some-
thing that could be done in a few
months. He did state that a com-
mittee should be formed to eval-
uate the present structure. and
study possible variations for the
futurestructure.

While on the subject of the
time factor involved in change,
Rea gave a brief outline of the
procedure that must takeplace
for proposed changes that the
Board submits. The Committee
of Higher Education in Harris-
burg must approve all major pro-
posals. If they find any areas of
the proposals that must be revis-
ed, the Trustee Committees must
consider possible revisions, work
out the details, and resubmit the
proposals to the committee in the
State Capitol.

Rea pointed out that neither
the Trustees nor the committee
in Harrisburg meet daily. and of-
ten the time lapse is longer than
those who would be concerned by
the proposal would expect.

Other members commented that
the Board realizes that students
have only a few years at the Uni-
versity during which they are
aware of necessary change. and
for that reason. they expect it to
occur immediately.

A point that was stressed
thr,oughout the discussions was the
fact that the Board have very lit-
tl_e_to say about the academic de-
cisions made at the University.

“Ninety per cent of the deci-
sions concerning curriculum are
made by the faculty." Dr. Posvar
said. "Recently. many students
have expressed feelings that indi-
cate that the Trustees make these
decisions."

“We are for the most part spe-
cialists,” one Trustee said. “We
deal mainly with legal and finan-
cial problems, since that is our
professional field.”

As the meeting ended. ever_y-
one agreed that the dialogue had
been informative for both stu-
dents and Trustees. and that fu-
ture discussions between the two

    
 

  An Open Letter To Arab
Students at the University

To all my Arab friends. salaam
aleikum, peace unto you and to us.
all.

What I would like to say to
you is in response to a leaflet
that was distributed on the Pitt
campus on March 13. (As it was
passed out by Arab students. I
took it to represent the viewpoint
of the Arab student communit_y.
The leaflet consisted of a reprint
of -parts of an article which ap-
peared in the Manchester Guard-
ian on Feb. 1. 1968. a picture
of supposed victims of napalm
bombing. and a statement in red
saying “STOP ISRAELI NAZISM
IN PALESTINE."

I would like to ask you some
questions. Generally speaking.
why did the person who quoted
parts of the Guardian article
not use the entire context of the
article. indeed. the entirepage‘?
It took me some time to find a
copy of the article. for it seems
that the only issue of the Man-
chester Guardian over the past
three years to be missing from
Hiolman Library is the one you
used. I found another copy at Du-

_ qiiesne University. however. and

was not too surprised to find
another article on the same page
expressing the opposite point of
view. It is the practice of a re-
sponsible journal such as'the
Guardian to offer the public a
balanced view: one which you
use of the Guardian letterhead
seemed to misrepresent.

As to the picture of “Ka-fr As-
ud" —— I am totally opposed to in-
nocent suffering. anywhere. Here
we seem to agree. so why not
show equally gruesome scenes
of civilian suffering. such as the
public square hangings in Bagh-
dad. or the Machaneh Yehudah
market bombing in Jerusalem. or
dead Hebrew University students
in a supermarket. or the bomb-
torn bodies of more University
students and professors in a gut-
ted cafeteria?

As to the charge of Nazism in
Palestine —— I am totally opposed
to Nazism anywhere. Here we
seem to agree. also. But let me

‘help you in identifying Nazism
and identify some Nazis living
in the Middle East. Most people
understand Nazism as a belief in
anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism is
not defined in the dictionary as
“being against Semitic peoples."
it means being against Jews. The

Lanuuage
Determines

Character

Editor. The Pitt News:

The controversy over the lan-
guage requirement has been dis-
cussed in passionate and irrele-
vant terms. The question is not so
much. “Will.I have an opportu-
nity to use my French. Spanish.
German. etc? Will it help melto
understand’ the foreign culture or
my own better?". it is rather.
“Should a person with a B.A. de-
gree have been exposed to a for-
eign language?" A survey of the
schools with a Phi Beta Kappa
chapter reveals that all of them
have a language requirement.
Before you continue your cam-
paign against foreign languages.
better ask yourself what kind of
institution you want the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh to be.

Sincerely.

Nazis did not seek to exterminate
any ‘of the 40 million Muslims
in the Soviet Union. or 100 mil-
lion muslims in the Middle East
during World War II. but they did
make Europe iudenfrei by 6 mil-
lion less Jews. How can a Jewish
state believe in exterminating

' Jews?

But there are Nazis in the Mid-
dle East. and they are the same
Nazis who hold the same views

toward murdering Jews as did‘

Hitler. In fact. some of them
are former members of Hitler's
band of fascist. racist murderers.
One is the f'ormer SS-Standarten-
fuehrer (Colonel) Leopold Gleim,
head of the Gestapo in 'war-occu-
pied Poland. who is under the
death sentence of —a Polish court
for war crimes. Gleim now goes
under the name "Ali al-Nahar" in

Cairo. where he controls the Egyp-

tian secret police as well as con-
centration camps for political
prisoners. Under his police juris-
diction are also Egypt's few re-
maining Jews. I

SS-Obersturmbannfuehrer Ber-
nard Bender, who during World
War II headed a special branch
of the Gestapo which hunted Jew-
ish “resistance groups. goes
around Egyptian police circles
as Lt. Colonel "Ben Salem.” It
is also a matter of record that

- Bender came to Egypt together

with Dr. Hans Eisler, the notor-
ious physician of the Buchenwald
concentration camp.

Among those who are training
Egyptian “volunteers" for the
Palestine Liberation Army are
Erich Alten alias “Ali Bella,“
former head of the Jewish Depart-
ment of the Gestapo in Nazi-oc-
cupied Galicia: Willy Berner
alias “Ben Kashir," an SS vet-
eran from the Mathausen concen-
tration camp; and Colonel Bau-

mann alias "Ali ben Khaderf"

one of the exterminators of the
Warsaw ghetto.

Among those who now super-
vise or help in Egypt's anti-Is-
raeli and anti—Jewish propaganda
are Franz Buensche, one-time
official -of Goebbel’s Propaganda
Ministry. and author of such.
books as Sexual Crimes of the
Jews, and Louis Heiden, also a
veteran of Goebbels ministry
and now the translator and dis-
tributor of Hitler's Mein Kampf

  Freedom Not Force

Editor. Pitt News:

This letter is addressed to you
from one who is much concerned

. with the welfare of all sincere

students of the University of
Pittsburgh. as well as all sin-
cere students everywhere. It is
the result of free objective
thought of one sincere individ-
ual.

I agree with free thought for
everyone (and equal opportunity
for everyone who wishes to ac-
cept that opportunity —- with
responsibility): BUT the thinking
of Joe Doak must not interfere
with the right of John Doe to think
freely. form his own opinion. and
act accordingly.

Any action which interferes
with the thinking of another in-
dividual. or his right to act in ac-

cordance with that thinking —
A within the

law. is certainly
against the very first principle
of free thought. _How__ can an in-

 

Campaign of 1956 that Egyp-
tian officers had been receiving
an Arabic translation of Mein
Kampf as part of their stand-
ard army issue.

My Egyptian friends. did you
know about SS-General Oscar
Dirlewanger, whose brigade spe-
cialized in wiping out partisans
in Poland and the Ukraine. and
who has the distinction of being
responsible for the personal safe-
ty‘ of President Nasser? Here

would seem to be another example‘
of Nazism in the Middle East.

and I join with you in printing in
red ink “STOP NAZISM."

Innocent people die in war. my

It seems that a course that has
the ominous title of Geology 80
would be a fairly unpopular one.
and that the professor would have
a hard time teaching his students
anything or even holding their at-

"tention. This is definitely not the

case of Dr. Harry J. 'Werner's‘

Rocks 80 classes. His large lec-
ture classes are always full. .and
never uninteresting.

Q

Most of his students would de-
scribe Prof. Werner as "crazy."
or a "complete nut." A student
never knows what to expect next
in his classes. He is always crack-
ing jokes. or playfully picking on
someone in the class. But through

-''«,,the joyful atmosphere that per-

vades his classes.- the student is
‘still able to learn about Geology.

Dr._ Werner sees a sense of hu-
mor as a very necessary quality
in his teaching profession. “I’ve
got something to sell.“ he said.
“and ifyou are going to sell ideas
to people you’ve got to first get
their attention. I enjoy what I

do." he continued. "and I like
people to enjoy it with me." He
goes about getting his students
attention. and making them en-
joy his course in very novel ways.
If he shows a geologic movie Dr.
Werner will pull out a small

- flashlight and escort late comers

to seats so that they will not stum-
ble and fall in the dark. And he is
always a source of jokes and hu-
morous stories during his lectures.

On a,serious note, Dr. Werner‘
commented on some of the prob-
lems plagueing today’s world.
Even though he was in the Ma-
rine Corp, as a fighter pilot dur-
ing the second World War he per-
sonally doesn’t agree with the
war in Vietnam. “I am in sympa-
thy with those who feel that they
must rebel against the war, but I
can't sympathize with, and am
violently opposed to people who
defame the flag,” he said. “War
is one hell of a bad situation, it’s
like having a tiger by the tail,
butll have no sympathy for those
who ridicule the country,” he
continued.

He gave his views on the social
turmoil sweeping our country.
“All I can say." he began. “is
that we have problems. and these
problems are not going to be im-
proved by a lot of hotheads. I
wish I had some answers. There
are social injustices in this world
that have to be alleviated." he
continued. but burning and riot-
ing ‘aren‘t going to improve the
situation in the long run." The
only solution that Dr. Werner
could see is that somehow every-
one is going to have to become
responsible citizens.

He said that the one thing that
he hated was the ever growing
polarization of different groups
of people. He mentioned that
what blacks and whites most need-
ed was a give and take relation-
ship. “It'll be a beautiful day."
Werner said. “when blacks and

whites can have the conviviality
that exists between Polacks and
Italians; where the two groups
down grade each other. with con-
.stant jokes. but still retain a mu-
tual respect.”

“As for me,” Dr. Werner con-

‘ cluded, “if I can get through to a

few people, through my work and
actions, and help make better cit-
izens out of that few, then I know
that I have contributed something
to society: When I was in college
there were some wonderful peo-
ple, who were very good to me,

by God I owe something to them
and to the world.” I

Eastern Champion Cindrich

‘Scwore He’d   N e

by MARTHA HARTLE
Associate Sports Editor

It was September and the
university was bubbling with
football optimism. Sports Illus-

‘ trated Magazine had just list-
ed Ralph Cindrich as one of the
top five sophomore college pros-
pects in the country.

But Ralph never got a chance
to prove himself on the gridiron
last fall.'An ankle injury shelved
him for the rest of the season af-
ter the opener at UCLA.

Today. Ralph is the Eastern
Collegiate heavyweight wrestling
champion. yet because of circum-
stances surrounding the football
season. there was question in his
mind whether to compete in
wrestling at all.

“When I first came here I
wanted to wrestle, but after foot-
ball season I didn’t want any part
of it,” he explained. “The Penn
State game especially was a big
shock .  . not being able to play.
And after all the publicity, you
begin to think you’r a failure.

1 was feeling sorry for ‘my-
self. I swore then I wouldn't
wrestle and." he paused. . . .
with any other coach I wouldn‘t
be wrestling. With coach Adams
and coach Fehrs you can‘t help
it." . .
Cindrich_wasn‘t sure if he want-
ed to wrestle when he walked_on—

After Great Winter

-Bright Future Seen for

by ED CONLEY

Any local track enthusiasts who are upset because of a lack
of solid thinclad squads in this area, settle down. Track is here
to stay, and it’s truly going big time.

Jim Banner has just finished leading his tracksters through the
most successful winter campaign around here in a long time. The
varsity team won their only two dual meets easily and were much bet-
ter than expected in the invitationals. The freshmen. too. were sur-
prisingly good. They won three meets in as many tries and sent an -
above average medley relay quartet to many classics.

Everyone knew about stars like '

Jerry Richey and Bryant Salter.
but Banner came up with some
other top_performers this season.

. Smitty Brown was the most con-

vincing of any of the tracksters
during the campaign. fulfilling
the double role of running in the
600-yard dash and anchoring the
mile relay team.

Other names like John Aiden,
Rudy Hufnagle, Carlos Reisen,
and Wally Swiger surprised onlook-

ers-as they consistently beat out

their opposition in relays and on

individual terms.

The sophomores were. indeed.
what made Banner a winner this
year.

“They‘ve come a long way. ex-

_pecially the guys on_the relays,"

Banner said. "They've done ‘a
tremendous job."

If these success stories aren't ' .
enough to convince the track fans,
the feelings of the people around
the nation who run,the classics
should be. —

‘-‘They certainly recognize the job
the boys have done." Banner not-
ed. "Before. we didn't have anyone
in those meets. "

"You can tell they're starting to '

take notice by the seeding. We
were in some fast heats." he con-
tinued.

The tracksters can offer a dif-
ferent kind of evidence to sup-
port their cause, too. Out of a
possible thirteen the varsity set ten
new records this winter; the
frosh broke three more; and a
couple of field house marks were
topped.

"Like I say the records are only
bonuses." Banner insisted. "Once
you get them you know you're get-
ting along. though."

There is no reason why the thin- _
"getting ‘

clads can’t continue s

HEAVYWEIGHT Ralph Cindrich will have his work cut out for him

' next week when he faces the nation's best in the NCAA cham-

place winners return, including an Olympian from Oregon State.

back ‘in January. His opponent
in that match was last year's East-
ern heavyweight champ. Mark
Kane of Navy. ‘'1 was so scared I
couldn't even walk." he recalls.

Ralph drew with Kane in that
opener and he climaxed an un-
defeated Eastern season last week-
end at‘Princeton, but the mat sea-
son isn’t over yet. Next week, he’ll
be in Utah for the NCAA cham-
pionships, where there’ll be “no
easy competition."

Tracksters

found some concern for the up-’
coming outdoor competition. but it
probably isn’t as serious as one
might think.

“We’ll be thin in some event,
like the discus,” he said. “The
people in them "are good, but it
helps to have more than one.”

Thus. the toughest job for'Ban-'
ner seems to be getting more than
one good man in his trouble areas.
The coach is a busy recruiter. how-
ever. and if his past experiences

‘mean anything the track buffs

needn’t worry.

"Of course/ in track you never
know until May." he mentioned._
“But. there ‘are some outstand-
ing boys who we think are in-'
terested in coming here. It‘s just
a matter of who.we‘1l get.“

\

JIM BANNER
A Track Success

The Dents, undefeated cham-
pions of the Intramural Inde-
pendent League, ,are still
competing. The sophomore-in-

. tested. team of Dental students

faces Duquesne’s intramural

champions _ _ ‘tomorrow

be back.“ Ralph explains. One of
those returnees is Jesse Lewis
from Oregon State. who didn't
wrestle last term because he
was on the U.S. ol_ympic wrest-
ling team. “I thinkhe finished
sixth in the Olympics." Ralph
added. ‘ . sixth best in the
world."

Lewis was in the national fin-
als last year. where he lost to the

champion Porter. And there's a boy

returning from Michigan State
who beat Porter twice. "He pinned
him once in a dual meet and de-
cisioned him in the Big Ten cham-
pionships." Ralph quipped.
Maryland’s Ralph Sontagg
will undoubtedly be‘ in Utah too,
and Cindrich is “not looking for-
ward to meeting him again.” Cind-
rich decisioned Sontagg in a dual

- meet this season, but he con-

siders Sontag to be the-best wres-
tler he’s ever faced;

Cindrich shut-out . his oppon-
ent in the Eastern finals and he
explains that he could have wres-
tled better in that one; “I couldn’t
get psyched for the match: I got
booed down from the fans there.
I was wrestling a boy from Prince-
ton and when I walked out for
the introductions. they booed me. .
I-wasn’.t used to that."

Ralph also explained that ‘a
couple of unfortunate breaks,prov-
ed costly to the grapplers in the

A Easterns. _"Mark Payne not being

able to wrestle and Bruce (Un-
angst) being injured and out all
year hurt the team." he continu-
ed. ‘,‘Bru,ce got sick after his
match. but things like that never
show up in the score sheets."

After the NCAA’s next week,

‘ wrestling season will be over for

Ralph, but spring football prac-

_ tice will just be getting underway.

“I’ve been considered a better

football player than wrestler,” he

explained, “and I hope to live up‘
to it. It’s the dream of every col-

lege ball player to play pro foot-

ball, but first I would like to make

the Pitt team.

   

 

"I hope things will be differ- . I

ent this season. but I don't want
to build my hopes up again."
