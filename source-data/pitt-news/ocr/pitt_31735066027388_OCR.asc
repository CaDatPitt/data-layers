You can’t buy love, but you can buy ﬂow-
ers. So hundreds of local ﬂorists stock the
ﬂower coolers in anticipation of the bouquet
bombardment and rose rush on Valentine’s Day.

And the business is good. Many ﬂower
vendors hope to turn a hefty proﬁt by the 14th.
None of them expect to have a problem with
sales on Valentine’s Day.

“It is the busiest single day of the year,” says
Earl Guffey, CEO of Johnston the Florist which
is the largest ﬂorist in the Pittsburgh area.

According to Guffey, the busiest single
week for ﬂower sales is the week of Mother’s
Day, and the busiest overall month is December.

Business sparks competition among the
hundreds of local ﬂower outlets, and Guffey
says making the best buds is the key to catching
sales.

“You try to have the best quality ﬂowers in
that particular [style],  but they must be fresh.
That’s the trick,” says Guffey.

But on Valentine’s Day, it’s not just any
fresh ﬂowers many people want, it’s roses.
Roses account for between 80 and 90 percent of
total ﬂower sales on the “Day of Love.”

The common observation for beleaguered
blossom buyers is the sharp rise in petal prices.

But, according to Guffey, this isn’t a sign of
ﬂorists just looking for a quick buck.

He says that meeting the high volume of
demand for roses means that greenhouses have
to raise thousands of rosebushes. In the off-
season, when rose sales slump, many of .
the ﬂowers are lost. Higher prices in the F
peak times make up for the loss in rev-
enue.

“About two ﬂowers are lost for every one
sold,” says Guffey.

Rich LoPresti, owner of Lubin and Smalley
Florist in Market Square, says that despite the
price increases, many ﬂorists aren’t raising their
prices as much as their distributors raise prices
on them.

Florists still loose more proﬁt in competi-
tion with other pedaling petal pushers.

“We end up taking a smaller markup  to
stay competitive,” says LoPresti,

‘ And costs go up even more because every-
thing doesn’t come up long—stem roses.

Guffey says when a long stem rose is made,
the “heads,” or blossoms, of the ﬂower must be
snipped. He says three or four ﬂower heads are
lost in the process of growing one long-
stemmed rose.

“It’s the old American Yankee way,” says
Guffey. “If you can sell them cheaper, then you

Under the proposed fall plan, the
number of blocks a student must buy

Choice Dollars, but can only be used

“CampusFunds” is another
account to make up for that loss.
Money from “Funds” can be used to
purchase food off campus, as well as
clothing, CDs, pay for laundry, and
other items that are sold from ven-

ing to make things simpler, we are

He said the beneﬁts of this new

plications it will cause.

good thing that makes these new sys-
tems worth troubling students,” he
said.

Teeters agreed saying American
Express monopolized the scarmers
on campus. Students must swipe
their PittCards through scarmers to
get into donns or eat in any campus
cafeteria.

Off-carnpus vendors must also
purchase scarmers from American
express to deduct a purchase from
Campus Funds, said Teeters.

FAS committee meets with
provost, GSO next in line

 

The committee making recommenda-
tions about the fate of some graduate depart-
ments may be one step closer to meeting its
March deadline after talking with the
provost Sunday.

Eleven programs have been at the fore-

" front of a departmental review of the Faculty

of Arts and Sciences designed to bring the
number of tenure-stream instructors down to
a size beﬁtting the school’s budget.

Though the proceedings began two
years before this year’s $2.6 million short-
fall, officials have said that the present deﬁcit
highlighted the need for reallocations.

Discussion at Sunday’s meeting sur-
rounded the group’s purpose, and no deci-
sions about reallocations were made.
Seymour Drescher, a member of the com-
mittee, would not comment on that meeting,
but he said that it was a “minor” part of the
evaluation process.

“We’rc still in the listening stage. We
don’t want to project any plans yet,” said
Dreschcr. “Then we have to start deliberat-
ing.  We have to get a very general idea of
what we want to do  decide the main over-
all points that we want to make, both posi-
tive and negative.”

Other members said that the meeting
was productive.

“We each needed to learn things from
the other, and I think it was very helpful in
that regard, but that’s all I’H say,” said David
Gauthier, another committee member.

Provost James Maher would not com-
ment on Sunday’s discussion.

“My role is to make sure everyone
understands the importance of making sure
our programs are as good as possible,”
Maher said. “'Ihere’s nothing’ usual about
that meeting for me.”

FAS Dean Peter Koehler said that
Maher has made it clear that he wants to stay
out of the process until the recommendations
have been nrade.

“The provost made it clear that we
needed to get something into him as close to
March 1 as we could, and we’re working
hard to achieve that,” said Koehler. “I think
he wanted an opportunity to communicate
directly with the members of the faculty
committee his concerns and his hopes, being
very clear that it was an internal FAS process
that he did not want to interfere in.”

Koehler addressed concerns of the
department chairs that this part of the process
has moved too quickly by restating the dead-
line and not commentating on the time
between the release of the Phase H docu-
ment that classiﬁed the departments and the
last three months, when chairs were notiﬁed

CORRECTIONS:

reported Monday.

Keith Campbell, like Jennifer Karch, is not an actual SGB mem-
her as he was identified Monday. He is a committee member.
The Linguistics department is in category four, not category five, as was

about the forward motion of proceedings
now underway.

“‘Perfect’ is a term that means every-
body is fully happy, and in that sense, no, it
was not perfect,” said Koehler “I think that
there was a tight timeline. But the presenta-
tions that we asked the departments to make
were to give them the opportunity to update
the infomration which we had asked them to
provide as long ago as 1995. Several depart-
ments had indicated that there had been
changes  that they wanted us to know
about. Some departments had said that the
information that we had was inaccurate.”

“I felt it was much better to have the
departments have that opportunity to 
speak directly to the panel, this faculty panel,
than not,” said Koehler. “And it would have
been nice to give them a few more days of
time, but we really had to get on.”

When asked if the committee felt that
the humanities had been hit too hard by the
proceedings, Drescher said, “I would rather
take the heat for not responding than the heat
for responding.”

Koehler responded to faculty concerns
about the humanities by saying, “Nobody
has been hit.”

When asked if that area had been sin-
gled out, Koehler said that departments were
classiﬁed “category four” so that they would
be looked at more closely.

“[They were singled out] only in the
sense that seven departments, all in humani-
ties, were put into this holding category four
for further study of their graduate pro-
grams,” said Koehler. “That was not done
because they were in the humanities; that
was done because their graduate programs
had certain common characteristics about
which we wanted to learn more.”

Koehler said that one such characteris-
tic, size, “is a very prominent one.”

Koehler also said that he thought the
process has been objective.

“It’s a process that people get very ner-
vous about,” Koehler said “It is a very
strong committee and a committee that
works hard to make itself fully informed and
do what’s best for FAS. In the long run, this
will be a very positive development for FAS.

"Ihere’s no intention hero of weaken-
ing strong programs, weakening the human-
ities, or anything of the sort. But in times of
limited resources, we have to make sure that
we use the resources that we have to our best
advantage.” g

Koehler said that it is not just depart-
ments in categories four and ﬁve, those to be
reviewed or reduced, that will be the focus of
the cooperative efforts that the provost is
calling for. ‘

“Our planning goes much beyond the

Student Government: Join  
the crusade against Bigelow!

Rebecca M Jones

 

Students interested in helping to make
the dream of a traffic—free Bigelow
Boulevard a reality can now do so by join-
ing the Bigelow Boulevard Task Force.

The task force will be a group whose
main focus is to close Bigelow. It will con-
sist of three different divisions: research,
public relations, and a University coalition.

The research division will focus on
collecting information on the previous trial
closing of Bigelow, which will include
how local businesses and traffic were
affected. Researchers will also collect data
on how other urban schools have solved
similar problems in their areas.

The public relations division will be
using the research collected for publicity,
letter writing, and lobbying city council
members who may be opposed to the clos-
ing. .
The University coalition division of
the task force will be comprised of both
students and campus administrators. It will
be the students’ responsibility when work-
ing on this division to rally for student
support of the closing throughout the
University community.

Jennifer Molluso, the chair of the task
force, said this is an important issue, and
students should come to the first big meet-
ing on Thursday in order to show support
for the task force. It will be at 8 p.m. in the
SGB office in the William Pitt Union.

Molluso said there are a number of
reasons why students should support this
issue and join the task force. ‘

“Safety is an obvious important rea-
son,” Molluso said. “It’s not safe to play
chicken with these cars.”

Some people have proposed that the
University build a bridge connecting the
two sides of the street, rather than closing
Bigelow. Molluso said that would be
unsatisfactory.

“A bridge defeats the purpose. We
want a center for our campus, and Bigelow
runs right through what would be the cen-
ter of campus,” Molluso said. “People
don’t see a campus. They see buildings
scattered everywhere. We need an identity
for our University. We are lacking a col-
lege community atmosphere.”

If Bigelow closes permanently, ‘plans
such as creating a park-like atmosphere
seem to have the most potential. However,
to get students involved, Molluso has pro-
posed that the task force take ideas from
students on what they feel should be done
with the land.

One idea is to have students enter a
sort of contest by submitting their propos-
als to the task force, and one will be cho-
sen.

“Of course we can’t adhere to the
exact plans of a student because of engi-
neering purposes and potential costs of

plans, but the winning idea will be incor-
porated into the reconstruction of
Bigelow,” she said.

According to Molluso, both the
University of Pennsylvania and Ohio State
University have taken main streets on their
campuses and closed them off to traffic in
order to position a center point to their
campuses.

“Other universities have a central
location to their campuses. Why can’t
we?” Molluso asks.

One reason may be because during the
trial closing of Bigelow Blvd. last semes-
ter, many South Craig Street businesses
complained about the traffic during that
time. Cafe Azure, which is located on
South Craig, credited the closing of their
business to the onslaught of new traffic,

. according to Molluso.

“Bigelow was only closed for one
month. How could that have created a sit-
uation where they would have had to close
down?” she said.

Other businesses located closer to
campus have openly stated that they are
strongly in favor of keeping Bigelow open.
Some businesses, such as The “O,” have
even gone as far as to take out ads in local
papers to show that they do not support the
closing.

The “O” has said that during the test
closing, they lost about 30 percent of busi-
ness due to the traffic ﬂow and loss of
parking.

Molluso says that while official results
from the closing are still unavailable, she
has been given some ﬁgures early on.

According to these preliminary
results, about 76 percent of the traffic ﬂow
on University streets is not even from the
University employees or students, but
rather from people passing through to dif-
ferent areas of the city. Commuters ﬁnd it
easier to travel to locations such as
Squirrel Hill or Shadyside by using
Bigelow Blvd. in order to get onto Forbes
Avenue.

“During the closing, these commuters
found other ways to get where they were
going,” Molluso said. “It can be done.”

As the chair of the task force, Molluso
would like to see representatives from
each student organization (governance
groups, SGB committee members,
Greeks, etc.) at the meeting. Any other stu-
dent interested in this matter is encouraged
to attend also.

“We can make this happen, or we can
just do nothing. If we do nothing, nothing
will happen,” said Molluso.

The Bigelow Boulevard Task Force
meeting will take place Thursday night
at 8 p.m. in 617 of The William Pitt
Union. Applications are being taken for
the research and public relations divisions,
and for the University coalition. If interest-
ed, call Jennifer Molluso at the SGB
office, or stop by in 617 WPU.

“It’s serving American Express’ inter-
ests more than ours as students,” he said.

DalMolin also said CampusFunds will
just make the PittCard into another credit
card. ,

“Why bother putting money into an
account on your student ID when you

_ already have a bank account?” he said.

‘The Choice Dollars program put- money

‘ on the ID card to be used solely for food.

VV1th CampusFunds, you will have the
option to purchase anything that a vendor
sells that accepts them. Why have two sep-
arate accounts for the same thing?”

DalMolin blamed American Express
for other widespread campus problems. He
said students form long lines to get into
their dormitory because the scanner check-
ing their I.D.s can’t handle the traﬂic.

He also said the new system compli-
cated Student Government Board elections
last semester, and that the system failed
again checking students into last months
George Stephanopolous lecture.

“The technology doesn’t work every-
where all of the time. American Express
should be bending over backwards to make
sure that it works,” he said. “The conve-
nience is not always there.”

David Teeters said some problems
should be expected, but that there is no

excuse for so many failures.

“There are always bumps in the road
on the way to technology,” Teeters said.
“However, we seem to be driving into
every pothole there is.”

Board members also said students
were not consulted in the decision making
process. V

“We wanted to let the administration
know that we don’t support what they have
decided,” DalMolin said. “No one ever
bothered to ask the Student Government
Board or the student body what they
thought about the system before they
implemented this. Students need to have
input to go over the consequences of imple-

menting the program.”

Board member Ryan Weidenmiller, C

who heads the Food Services Task
Force,wrote a letter objecting to the change
to John DeVrtto, the associate vice chan-
cellor of Business. In that letter he advocat-
ed Choice Dollars as a more efficient sys-
tem.

“The past success of the Choice
Dollars Program and the quality of satis-
faction it has provided for the students here
is evident on a University-wide scale,”
Weidenmiller wrote. “As it stands now it
would be an unforttmate loss for the
University’ community, when the Choice
Dollars program is abandoned in late
April.”

do.”

Still, many stores try to specialize
in only the best quality, which takes a
little more green to get.

But how do they pick “the best”?
Well, by their grades, of course.

LoPresti explains that many ﬂower
shops grade their ﬂowers within their
own varieties.

Names like Madame Delbar,
Samantha, and Livia are not necessari-
ly the objects of a young man’s heart,
but they do catch the eye of a belle or
two: -they are just three examples of the
different varieties in which roses are
graded.

LoPresti says that many consider
the ﬂower’s head size and stem length,
among other factors.

The best may get set in clouds of
baby’s breath for ﬂoral arrangements,
while others may ﬁnd themselves hit-
ting street comers, at a somewhat lower
price.

But roses aren’t the only ﬂowers
sought for February 14th.

Christine Glabicki, the manager at
Tutto Bello Florist in Mt. Lebanon,

says she specializes in unusual ﬂowers
and that sales are very good. '

“Only half our requests are for
roses,” says Glabicki. She says that the
rest of the requests are ﬁlled by ﬂowers
such as tulips, lilacs, and hyacinths.

She says the biggest blossom
boom will be Friday evening, when
most people hope to grab some on their
way home from work.

“From 4 to 8 on Friday, it will be
insane in here,” says Glabiaki.

Many ﬂorists will be making their
wheels go round for the thing that
makes the world go round, too. Nearly

every ﬂorist in Pittsburgh now offers a

delivery service.

“I think We’re providing a nice ser-
vice,” says Guffey about the delivery
service from his 25 stores. He says that
they cover a 150-mile radius from the
city. '

Love knows no limits, not even to
get ﬂowers where they have to be.
Before getting to the city, ﬂowers may
have traveled several thousand of miles
to be placed in bouquets just to head
right back out the ﬂower shop door.

Some retailers grow their own
ﬂowers, but nevertheless, most turn to
an out-of-town middle man or ﬂower
broker during the rushes so they don’t
lose out.

. “I buy directly from a broker in
New York City,” says Glabicki. “And
he can ﬂy ﬂowers in within 12 hours.”

It’s not so much where all the ﬂow-
ers have gone as it is where they’ve
come from that determines availability
and shipping price markups.

Before getting to many of these
brokers, tlrey’ve been ﬂown in from the
major growing areas which, according
to Guffey, are South America, Holland,
Israel, California, and Oregon.

He says the biggest exporter
among those areas is South America.

‘The climate is just natural for
them down there,” says Guffey.

Despite all the effort they have to
put in during these seasons, many
ﬂorists still consider their work not just
a labor for love, but of love.

“This is my favorite season,” says
Glabicki. “I’m in my glory, and I love
coming to work.”

Ultimately, ﬂorists hope that this
Friday people will, in the words of
Walter Hagen, “Be sure to stop and
smell the ﬂowers along the way.”

PA Bar Assoc. needs to be more PC

 

Here’s a tough one: what’s the difference between
interviewing for a waitstaff job at Denny’s and inter-
viewing for a State Superior Court judgeship? Well,
humble as Denny’s waitstaﬂ may be, at least the man-
agers who interview the members have attended
human resource workshops. On these occasions, they
are instructed to focus solely on candidates’ profes-
sional qualiﬁcations such as they are, and they are told
that they may not ask personal questions. Personal
questions or comments such as, “Gosh, you have six
kids. Who is going to baby—sit while you are at work?”
are avoided

Apparently, no such sensitivity training was given

I to the Pennsylvania Bar Association committee that

rates state—wide judicial candidates. Perhaps within the
higher echelons of legal society, it would be considered
unnecessary——evenrude——tobriefattomeyson
components of law stemming from the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 and implemented by the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.

The recent experience of Allegheny County Court
of Common Pleas Judge Joan Orie Melvin shows once
again that a double standard for men and women
exists. John Carpenter, the chairman of the committee,
said that he meant nothing offensive when he opened
the interview by referring to Melvin’s six children In
hisapo1ogy,Carpenterstatedthathemeantitina
“grandfatherly’ ’ way. That was yet another unfortunate
choice of words. This guy is so obviously out of it in
terms of political correctness, let alone legality, that it is
notatallhardtobelievehimlamsureheis sorry.I
believe he didn’t mean to be olfensive, and he is still
probably scratching his grandfatherly head aboutthe
whole deal.

The point is, Melvin went before the commission
expecting to have her legal credentials, knowledge,
and experience reviewed and wound up feeling as if
she had to defend her position as a working mother by
discussing her babysitting arrangements. Would her
husband have been asked what his babysitting arrange-
ments were? If it’s not OK for a Denny’s manager to
ask a prospective waiter or waitress about children,
babysitting, and the like, isn’t it also not OK for a Bar
Association committee to ask candidates running for
Superior Court Judgeships the same thing?

I spoke to Judge Melvin about her situation, and
she said that because she is running for a publicly-
elected state office, and not interviewing for a job per
se, her situation is not exactly parallel to that of a pri-

vate sector employee. Even so, one might have expect-
ed something a little more enlightening ﬁom a com-
mission made up of attorneys with political ambitions
—— at the very least, a little more political savvy. For
example, they could have asked her about her opinions
on the Family and Medical Leave Act, state-sponsored
daycare, or welfare. They could have tried to entice her
into expressing her opinions on issues relevant to
working women and working mothers in general.
Instead, Judge Melvin’s interview before the com-
mission started off on the personal and continued in
that vein. The judge talked to me about her silent
amazement when the very ﬁrst thing out of Chairman
John Carpenter’s mouth was a reference to her chil-
dren, “so youngandsoc1oseinage.”Nolessthanthree
other members of the commission also continued in
this vein with patronizing inquiries into “who would
care for the children” and even going so far as to help-
fully point out such salient facts as “Superior Court
judges ‘have to hear cases in Philadelphia and
Harrisburg.” Gee, is that why it’s called a state oﬂice?
The comrnission’s talent for pointing out the obvious
was exceeded only by their obtuseness. “She didn’t
express any offense at the time,” they said — wow, a
judge submerged her personal feelings and acted pro-
fessionally during an interview.
Ontheotherhand,itisafactthathavingsixldds
is likely to impact on anyone’s ability to do any job.
'I‘hat’s a reality of life that egalitarian legislation and
politics cannot help. But the point is, focusing on the
factﬂiatsixchildrentakeuptirneandspaceinones
life is not appropriate in a professional situation. “Is the
person qualiﬁed for the job?” is the only question job
interviewers or even judicial appointment commis-

sions are qualiﬁed to assess. Once you start delving‘ S

into the personal, you are likely to ﬁnd things in any-_
one’s life which may or may not impact his ability to
perform professionally. The grandfatherly  h is
appropriate only when dealing with your grandkids,
but not for candidates nrnning for state oﬂice.

A Melvin told me an anecdote about another woman
judge, Carol Loss Mansrnann, who was up before a
srrmlar commission about 15 years ago, Appapgndy,
she was also grilled on personal details and domestic
arrangements. Melvin told me that her main reason for
complaining about the inappropriateness of the com-
rnission’s questions is as follows: “I have ﬁve daugh-
ters. I don’t want them put through the same thing. I
don’t want this to still be happening in 20 years.”

[Editor’s note: Jay DeMartino’s col-
umn is generally run on Tuesdays.
Due to the timeliness of the letter
related to the FAS series we have
been running, this column was held
until today. Next week, DeMartino
will once again appear on Tuesday.

Just recently, I reread C.P. Snow’s
lecture on the two cultures debate. It
is an excellent work of literature
which is of interest to both humani-
ties and technical majors. The basis
of the lecture, which was given dur-
ing the early 1950s, is that there are
two separate intellectual cultures: the
scientists and the literary intellectu-
als. He argued that both of these cul-
tures were mostly concerned with
their own spheres of reality and had a
great deal of animosity for the other.
Some might say that while that was
the case nearly 50 years ago, great
progress has been made since then to
bridge the gap. Progress has been
made, but not nearly enough. If one
takes a look at the students of techni-
cal and humanities majors here at
Pitt, it is quite obvious that the prob-
lem has not gone away.

Being an engineering major for
the past few years, it has been my
privilege to listen to all the wonderful
gossip and inside jokes running
through Benedum Hall. In Benedum,
and to most engineers, the phrase
“CAS major” is almost a derogatory
term. Calling someone a “CAS
major” will always bring a deep
chuckle from those involved in engi-
neering. However, it is a two-way

THE PITT NEWS

street, and the insults go both ways.
When I tell humanities majors that
I’m an engineering major, they look
at me as if I’d just escaped from
Western Psych and say something
like, “You must be insane!” Or worse,
the word “geek” _can often be heard
muttered under someone’s breath.
But these are just the surface ani-
mosities, the important ones go much
deeper. Humanities majors are often
considered (by engineers) to be out of
touch with reality in the sense that the
entire world is pervaded with tech-
nology, and they all but ignore it.
Likewise, engineering majors are
considered to be
equally out of touch
with reality because
they are only con-
cerned with technolo-
gy where people are
often only an after-
thought.

Of course, these
are broad generaliza-
tions, and anyone actu-
ally believing all of
these things would be hard to find.
These attitudes are still here, howev-
er diluted they may be. It is a traves-
ty that nearly 50 years after C.P.
Snow’s lecture, not .much has
changed.

Like all insults, there is a grain of
truth to these. Engineers do some-
times get caught up in their own little
world, losing their human sides. As a
group, I think engineers are probably
the worst communicators. In the
School of Engineering, if one does
not place out of English classes

 

entirely, only one semester of English
writing is required. Many people I
know would have benefited greatly
from a couple of writing classes. Of
what use is a great technological
innovation that cannot be communi-
cated to a» potential manufacturer?
This is merely a practical considera-
tion. An engineer’s world view can be
greatly expanded through the human-
ities. I have made it a point in my
academic career to take as many
courses as possible in other depart-
ments. These classes have expanded
my horizon, helped me revise, and
given me new philosophies on my
approach to just about
everything. It is liber-
ating and a great men-
tal health break for
someone who hasn’t
seen the outside of
Benedum in a great
while. Concepts taught
in philosophy can even
give one a new look on
his career in engineer-
ing. Ethics are espe-
cially of interest to engineers because
once out in the work force and the
corporate world, scientists and engi-
neers make moral decisions every
day. It is the nature of society.

On the same note, I think there

.are a few things that humanities

majors should know about technolo-
gy. Computer literacy is a big one.
Word processors and spreadsheets are
wonderful time-saving tools. The
time taken to learn these things is
paid back tenfold by the timed saved
by using them. Furthermore, the

7

Enineeringand humanities, can't we all just get along?

internet is an endless source of infor-
mation for research and communica-
tion with collaborators all over the
world. Although there is indeed
something to be said for pencil and
paper: they are portable and indis-
pensable for writing down ideas that
come at the most inopportune times. I
write most of my ideas for these arti-
cles (among many other things) in a
little notebook which I carry with me
almost all the time. The sciences can
be mind expanding, as well. Some of
the elementary principles of quantum
mechanics are as fanciful as any fan-
tasy literature, with one added bonus
—— they help one understand how the
world works. Elementary understand-
ing of biology can help in raising
plants or keeping yourself from get-
ting sick. Even technical knowledge
is of great use to the artist. I know
many guitarists who will let no one
but themselves repair their instru-
ments. Electric guitars require some
knowledge about electronics;
acoustic guitars require some knowl-
edge about elementary physics.

Not all members of these two cul-
tures need to do these things. Some
already have. Although the existence
of Snow’s cultures is apparent,
inroads have been made toward fix-
ing the problem. The Honors College
is promoting a liberal studies degree
of which many engineers have taken
advantage as a dual major.

Jay DeMartino wishes that all majors
were 5-year programs to make room
for more electives in other depart-
ments.

I would like to thank p. r. taylor for
her column on the overuse of the word
“like.” It is annoying. I would also like
to add an additional hypothesis to the
reason for the abundance of not only
the word “like,” but the general use of
poor English among students here.

. I believe it is a sign of a larger
trend in declining language skills that
is accompanied by an increase in other
mental abilities. Although I have only
a cursory familiarity with the subject, I
have read on more than one occasion
that there is a general increase in I.Q.
scores. Also, supporting evidence
comes from the historical letters that
most are familiar with, typically writ-
ten by a civil war soldier to his family.
The language used by the most ordi-
nary of persons from that time and
before is far beyond my capabilities
today.

LETTERS

In light of this hypothesis as a
trend, I am hopeful of what Pitt stu-
dents of 2020 can achieve but afraid of
how they might express it.

David Borst
Chemistry Grad Student

I was rather disturbed by the arti-
cle “Prayer Unites Only Church and
State, Say Spectators.” In particular,
Karen Nachbar’s statement, “That’s
why we have such a thing a as ‘separa-
tion of church and state’  The gov-
ernment can’t recognize one religion
as better or more significant than
another, and the opposite seems to be
happening today,” is distressing.

What seems to be forgotten is what
“separation of church and state” is
derived from. The Constitution states:

“Congress shall make no law respect-
ing an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof...”
This does not mean officials cannot
bring their religious beliefs into their
own activities. No law was passed to
include the prayers, but rather, tradi-
tion dictates it. The president could
have just as easily taken the oath in his
office and not bothered with the cere-
mony, either. The whole purpose of the
ceremony is for the president to set out
his vision for America, and if he is
Christian and plans to act on his ideals,
then a prayer is more than appropriate.

I would like to offer a suggestion
to Greg Garvin, Pitt’s recycling coor-

Letters to the editor may be addressed to The Pitt News,

dinator. One of the main reasons that
“contamination” occurs is that most of
the recycling bins look like a trash can
with a sticker on the front. This makes
it very easy for people to throw their
garbage in any can they want, regard-
less of what it’s sticker reads. This
problem could be alleviated if each can
had a special cover on it —- a cover
that would allow only the material
meant to be recycled into the can. All
recycling containers should be
replaced so that only the containers for
“non-recyclables” would look like a
typical garbage can.

I hope that more students will
become conscious of the importance of
recycling and will take part in it more
often. ‘

Some things
are more
  important

     

Friday in Las Vegas, a man lost his
mind.

That’s not unusual. But unlike most
people who crash in the Mecca of many
vices, Oliver McCall didn’t break down
after losing his kid’s college fund to a
video poker machine or scalping his ticket
home for one last stand at the Mustang
Ranch.

Oliver McCall did it in a boxing ring.
In front of thousands in the stands and mil-
lions of television viewers, something
inside Mr. McCall’s head snapped.

McCall charged into the ring before
the ﬁght at full speed, barely missing a
ringside armouncer. He stared down the
taller, stronger, quicker, and heavier
Lennox Lewis in the pre-ﬁght introduc-
tion. He won the first round. He lost the
second.

In the third, he stopped punching. In
the fourth, he started crying.

In the ﬁfth, the ﬁght was stopped
because McCall wouldn’t defend himself.
Fans booed. The ﬁghter left in disgrace.
Lennox Lewis took credit for the victory,
but while his jabs were crisp, nothing he
did‘ hurt McCall physically as much as
Oliver had hurt himself mentally.

Maybe it was the result of drug and

alcohol problems that have chased the,

heavyweight forever. A drug test after the
ﬁght said no.

Maybe it was a rope—a—dope-esque
boxing style, which was McCall’s excuse
in the days following the ﬁght. Funny
thing was, his own comer didn’t know
about it. And when the ﬁght was stopped,
the boxer left before pleading his case.

either. ~

To be or not to be?

Pitt's athletic department has no plans to bring back any men’s squads

 

With the addition of the
women’s softball team to the
list of Pitt sports, a few of you
might think that since there are
now 10 women’s sports and
only nine men’s sports that a
new men’s sport might be on
the way. Sony, but you thought
wrong.

“No, not at this present
time,” says Senior Associate
Director Carol Sprague. The
addition of women’s softball is
trying to attract more women to
sports.

So why is the Athletics
Department trying to attract
more women to sports? An act
of Congress called Title IX
states that there is to be no sex-
ual discrimination in schools
and universities. This act atfects
the number of men and women
in sports. In a nutshell, if 10 per-
cent of men are involved in
sports, then there must be about
10 percent of women in sports,
too.

“There are many more

  

Head Coach George Dieftenbacli (far right) is still in tlie Pitt tennis picture.

men than women in sports [at
Pitt], and adding another men’s
sport would cause a bigger dis-
proportionality than there
already  says Spiague.

Title IX was the reason for
the elimination of the men’s
tennis and gymnastics teams
two years ago. Funding was a
small problem for the tennis
team, and there was a need for
outdoor courts. Still others think
Oval Jaynes, the athletic direc-
tor at the time, had a knack for
eliminating tennis teams. But
blame the people we send to
Washington for eliminating the
tennis and gymnastics team at

Pitt.

The men’s tennisteamwas
around from 1975-1995, and
was coached for all of those
years by George Dietfenbach,
the present women’s coach.

“We steadily got better
every year, with our last year
being the best,” says
Dietfenbach.

The tennis team had a
record of 190 wins and 145
losses in its 21 years — a very
impressive record for a Pitt
team.

Cyrus Zolghadii, a former
tennis player said, “My best col-
lege memories were represent-

ing Pitt.”
But now he cannot add to
those memories because of

Title IX.
“It was bad timing because
the men’s team was doing very

weH,” says Zolghadri. He 5
added, “[Title IX] is hurting '

schools other than Pitt.”

The men’s tennis team had
itsbestyearin1995aridhada
very good core of young play-
ers, including Braden
Dougherty, Brad Wade, and
Matt Mills. They all looked for-
ward to their tennis careers at
Pitt, but because of Title IX,
they are forced to sit in their

rooms, watch tennis on TV, and

wonder why they are not
scorching the Mountaineers in
straight sets.

While no school should
discriminate against sex, and
laws are needed to enforce this,
it isasharne toseegood athletes
not able to represent Pitt in their
sports. There has to be a better
way to enforce and carry out
Title IX other than to deny
someone the opportunity to
show others his talent.

In many people’s experiences here at
Pitt, the people one talks to, hangs outwith,
and even dates, are just trudging through
life. They are content to go to some class-
es, maybe do the homework, but basically,
live from Thursday to Thursday at C.J.’s.
This is not the case for Pitt gymnast Erika
Flamer.

Flamer, a sophomore, is very dedicat-
ed and driven in everything she does. From
an early age, she has proven that she can do
many things well at once. In addition to
being a gymnast, she danced tap and ballet
but was forced to make a choice between
dancing and ﬂipping at the age of eight.
She chose gymnastics and has concentrat-
ed on it ever since.

Now at Pitt, Flamer has not slowed
down. In addition to ﬁve hours of practice
per day, she is also canying a 19-credit
course schedule and interns for the public
relations department at Allegheny
Community College two days a week.
This past summer, she intemed for the
human resources department at Core States

 

around

Bank of Philadelphia.

For Flamer, the competitive spirit and
drive she has is not just about gymnastics.

“Sports, to me, are addictive. Winning
is addictive,” Flamer said. “I want to be
good. I don’t want to go out on the ﬂoor
unless I can be good. To me tliat’s the bot-
tom line.”

The work ethic Flamer shows
throughout the season is also evident in the
offseason.

“In the summer, I don’t really take
off,” she explains. “I do work out a lot, and
I work out a lot when I’m hurt, which gives
me the mental strength to say ‘I can get
through this.’ Then other people will fol-
low my lead.”

This year’s Pitt gymnastics squad is
expected to break many of the long-stand-
ing Pitt records. Flamer attributes this to the
winning attitude of her teammates and the
recruiting by Head Coach Debbie Yohrnan
and Assistant Coach Steve Craig. She feels
that the team ﬁnally has the right mix of
senior leaders and younger team members
with a pure desire to win.

“The sophomores are the real pushing
factor saying that this team can be good,”

Sean  Br/Sen
Flamer has added youth and excite-
ment to Pitt gymnastics.

Flamer said. “The freshmen they brought
in proved that we can be.”

The stats back up her statements, con-
sidering the last two times the Pitt record
for individual all—around score was broken,
it was by Flamer last year and cunent

True to Dodger B|ue?—The Pitt News Sports Briefing

0 Former Los Angeles Dodger

reportedly expressed interest in the
job with the ﬂedgling Tampa Bay
Devil Rays. Lasorda, who wore a

it was the biggest shame the sport of .box-
ing had ever experienced. McCall’s cor-
nerrnan agreed to an HBO interview while
the ﬁght was still on, taking the opportuni-
ty to question the sanity of his ﬁghter. The
chair of the Las Vegas State Athletic
Commission impounded the loser’s share
of the purse seconds after the bell.

Not a good start for McCall’s road
back to mental health, by any means.

To anyone who lost money on the
ﬁght, to anyone that sides with HBO or
Las Vegas or McCall’s comer in their
anger and amazement, remember this:

Oliver McCall is a human being.

You can call him an embarrassment, a
Crybaby, or a lunatic, but by labeling him
boxing’s worst and abandoning him on a
Vegas sidestreet, you are dismissing his
humanity.

He’s made mistakes. He’s been arrest-
ed three times in the past year. He picked
up a Christmas tree and threw it around a
hotel over the holidays. He’s screwed up.
A lot.

That does not make him boxing’s
worst embarrassment. In a sport where
Peter McNeely, Bruce Seldon, Andrew
Golota, and “Butterbean” run rampant,
purity of competition is no longer an issue.

We have a tendency to view athletes
as either robots or television characters.
They’re not. Just like salesmen, students,
saints, sailors, shaman, sportswriters, street
sweepers, and anybody else, athletes have
their moments of inner torment. McCall’s
moment just happened to be public.

His moment will cost him his career,
his pride, and most of his purse, unless the
lords of boxing are generous. That’s a
much bigger loss than any bet or a night of
boxing entertainment.

Everyone hits a point in his life when
he doesn’t want to put up his gloves any-
more. Don’t pass judgement —— fork over
your HBO cable bill or your ill—fated
wager and be thankful you’re still ﬁghting.

Dreams do come true. Ask Pitt red-
shirt freshman guard Kellii Taylor.

While in high school, Taylor was
recruited by more than a half dozen
schools. Syracuse, Georgetown,
Providence, and Maryland made it to
Taylor’s short list.

“What made me choose Pitt?  I
had a dream that I made it to the NBA,”
Taylor said. “First it showed me with a
Pitt uniform on. Then, I was in the
NBA. That’s what basically made me
come. I wanted to follow my dream.”

Taylor’s dream turned into a night-
mare in his first season when he suf-
fered a double—hemiated disk in his
back. The injury was severe, and after
surgery early in 1996, Taylor’s season
was over.

“It was hard. It was the worst year
of my life,” Taylor said. “I couldn’t
play. I was depressed. It was hard com-
ing over here and watching them play,
but I rooted them on and cheered them,
cause I wanted to win  I’d never had
surgery before in my life.”

Watching Taylor play this season,
one could never tell that he had been
injured at all. The six-foot, 175-pound
redshirt freshman is averaging 10
points, 2 assists, and 3.9 rebounds per
game. But his primary contribution has
been his defense.

As of Feb. 3, Taylor was ranked
first in steals in the Big East and third

,,overall in steals in the NCAA with a 3.2

per game average. He is currently
ranked sixth on Pitt’s single—season
steals list with 72. Taylor leads former
Pitt stars Sam Clancy and Jerry
McCullough (tied at seventh).

Taylor’s defense gets the attention
of his coaches and teammates.

“I think his defense is his best
[asset],” said Pitt Head Coach Ralph
Willard. “He’s in the top 20 in steals in
the country. He does a great job con-

given Pitt a rise so far this season.

testing the ball — a very good off—the—
ball defender. Certainly, his defensive
efforts have been very good.”

Senior guard Jason Maile attributes
Taylor’s success to his quickness. “He
has incredible quickness,” Maile said.
“His hands are extremely quick. He’s
getting steals, playing defense, and get-
ting after it. That’s definitely his
strongest point right now.”

The best defenders in basketball
are often extremely focused and men-
tally disciplined. Kellii Taylor is no
exception. “He takes the game really
seriously,” said senior forward Chad
Varga. ‘

“The biggest thing that shows his
mental toughness is the fact that he’s
come back from the operation,” Willard

said. “A double-hemiated disk opera-

tion is not something most people come
back from  He is a mentally tough
young man. He’s certainly a very com-
petitive young man. He wants to win.”

 

Flqmersa-

Even though Flamer did not even use
one of her official reciuiting visits to come
visit Pitt, she still decided to make Oakland
her home away from home.

“As a coaching  the University of
Pittsburgh was my ﬁrst choice,” Flamer
said. “Debbie [Yohman], as a coach,
seemed like someone who would be very
supportive and helpful.”

A main reason Plamer is so committed
is her father, David Flamer.

“My dad is like the team mascot,”
Flamer said. “He’s attended every gymnas-
tics meet since I’ve been here at Pitt.” Her
dad is also an elementary school principal in

Flamer’s background in athletics:

comes from her mother, Judy. Her mother
was a gymnast and a track and ﬁeld athlete
in her youth.

Flamer has a 12-year-old brother who
plays soccer and has broadened her view of
sports. She takes interest in her brother’s life
and has become a soccer fan.

Flamer looks forward to the future but *
wants to make sure that, in retrospect, she V

will have no regrets.

“I want to be proud of my accomplish- i_
