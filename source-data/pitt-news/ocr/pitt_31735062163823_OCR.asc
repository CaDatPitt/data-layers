Adopts New Measures

Acting on a number of complaints received from students, the
Department of Philosophy has moved to curb classes taught by gradu-
ate assistants and has arranged for a more ﬂexible course offering

social values meeting material conditions.

He has concerned himself with what he regards as “the de-
plorable gap in Western society between the arts and humanities
on one side and science and technology on the other.”

The ceremony will begin with an academic procession of ad-
ministrative and faculty personnel, each attired in robes denoting,
their scholarly rank and achievement.

Honors students then will be‘presented by Alan C. Rankin, assist-
ant chancellor of student and general affairs. With the exception of
University Scholars (students with an all “A” record for the past two
terms), students will be recognized by school and division. The
University Scholarswill be recognized individually.

This year 22 students have attained University Scholar distinc-
tion. They are: Richard Jules Bertin, William Herbert- Bowers,
Wayne Bruce Cook, Marc Kenneth Drezner, James Charles Duffy,
Patricia Maria Fabiano, Andrew Charles Harvey, Nancy Lynn
Heckler, Susan
_Mack.

Lee Baldwin Martin,‘ Jr., Patricia Katherine Mayernik, John
Carney Monro, Howard Neiberg, Opal Grace Regan, George R.
Repko, Jr., Patricia Ann Stauffer, Edward Joseph Stolinski, Robert
Joseph Swaskey, Louis Marshall Ulery and Patricia Anne Vidoni.

Students recognized by their schools as having a quality point
average which meets the standards of graduation with honor
total: Liberal Arts, 303; Engineering and Mines, 69; Pharmacy,
10; Business, 5; Education, 39; Nursing, 11; General Studies, 28';
Medicine, 30; Dentistry, 31; Law, 10.

The regional campuses show: Johnstown College, 86; Titusville,

Graduate school students include: Business, 5; Education, 27;

ophy who has been working on?
the proposed changes in that de-
partment, said that lectures under
the new plan will be taught only
by instructors, with graduate as-
sistants conducting reading dis-
cussions where applicable.

Dr. Schneewind emphasized
that the department has eased the
strain on distribution “require-
ments” for both philosophy majors
and those taking philosophy
courses merely for distribution _
credits.

He pointed out that only four
core courses will be required of
philosophy majors. They are In-
troduction to Logic and Sci-
entiﬁc Method (ll), History of
Philosophy 11 (21), and Intro-
duction to Moral Philosophy

(39).

Dr. Schneewind explained that
another advantage of the new plan
would be the chance for senior
philosophy majors to take gradu-
ate courses if they so choose. He
added that non—department un-
dergraduates, in certain cases,
also would be permitted to take
graduate logic courses.

Restructuring

other interested parties has "re-
sulted in the restructuring of the‘
Council, reported Jerry Epstein,
MC president.

Five main projects will come
under the reorganized council, all
of which have to do with the
orientation of freshmen and trans-
fers. ’

“The restructuring of the orien-
tation program took place after the

results were received from a sur- "

Vey on orientation sent to a cross-
section of the freshmen men,” Ep-
stein said. _

Upperclass Counselors

The ﬁrst project is the actual ,
freshmen orientation, during
which time the freshmen will meet
with upperclass counselors. “These
counselors will continue to meet
with the freshmen throughout the
trimester, acting in the capacity
somewhat similar to the mentors
for the freshmen women,” Epstein
explained. .

The upperclass counselors will
also meet with new freshmen
entering during the winter or
spring trimesters. Included as
their second project is a fresh-
men camp during‘ orientation

A Transfer Students Day is also‘
planned. “We intend to improve

Editorial: Sorry,   No Parking Here
" Well, that perennial bug—a-boo, the parking situation, has reared
its complicated head once again. This timelit has popped up in that.
A favorite haunt of lovers and drunkards alike, the Schenley quadrangle.
“t . - Captain Char1es'Ray, the Sherlock Holmes of the University’s ﬁnest,
* has announced his intention to declare the quad off-limits to all cars
during the peak hours of the weekend traffic jam when the students come
i to pick up and drop off their dates. »
Ray proposes to close the quad between 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. and be-
‘ tween 1 and 1:30 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights, and has‘ selected
the-unlikely weekend of the Shamrock Ball to try out his new system.
We would bethelast to claim that no parking problem exists on
the weekends, however, this seems to be a funny way of cleaning it up.
. Captain Ray seems to have forgotten that the only reason the quad is
~ so crowded during these hours is because the students have nowhere else
' to park when picking up their dates. Not a very brilliant deduction on
our part we must admit, but this is the simple crux of the matter. Clear-
, ing out the quad will certainly clear out the quad but nothing has been
‘ ‘ done to insure adequate parking facilities for the students to compensate

Notice the use of the word “adequate.” Captain Ray has included

education, but I resent being forc-
ed to accept it.

This feeling on my part is in
complete opposition to the views
expressed by Mrs. Freidan in her
book, The Feminine Mystique.
Mrs. Freidan, a staunch crusader
for women’s rights, is also a ﬁrm

advocate of higher education for -

women. She believes that marri-
age should be postponed until
after a young woman has com-
pleted her education (usually in-
cluding graduate school) and
launched her career. ‘

- For her young woman marri-
age is not a goal; it is not the
climax of her life with every
subsequent action or event an
anticlimax. The home that she
makes with her husband and
children should not be the whole
sphere in which she revolves.
She must make a life of her
own outside her home, too. Mrs.
Freidan accuses women‘ of be-
ing “cancer cells if they have
no life of their own.”'

I wholeheartedly disagree with
Mrs. Freidan’s contention’ that a
woman can not ﬁnd complete ful-
ﬁllment in her home and family.
A woman’s ﬁrst duty is to her
husband and her family; any in-
terest outside her home must re-
main secondary. If a woman can
fulfill her responsibilities and
still have time to pursue employ-
ment outside the home, all is well
and good, but to say that‘ a wo-
man has to use her intellectual ta-
lents to their fullest capacity or
she is not fulfilling her debt to
society, is not being fair to her.

I know many women, my math-
er included, who are extremely
intelligent, well-educated people
who are content to remain house-
wives. If they think they are
happy, it does not matter whether
the Mrs. Freidans of the world
consider them happy or not; by
trying to convince them they are
cancer cells, when they are not,
Mrs. Freidan may only succeed in
making them neurotic.

The problem seems to be that
many. household duties of the
past are lost arts today, through
the invention of dishwashers and

March means the end of the
basketball season and the
start of the baseball season.

Baseball is the most diffi-

cult two—team sport to bet.
It works differently from

football and basketball, and

this difference assures many
bettors of ending up in the
red. My experience with our
national pastime lasted one

Unlike basketball and
football, baseball betting
works on an odds system
rather than a points

baseball, like its counterparts
has to be studied thorough-

whether one team has a
whammy over another (the

17 of 18 times), how effective
a certain pitcher is against a
certain club, (Angels’ Ken

little tidbits he picks up in
his daily newspaper.

Panthers- Drake Prep for NIT

. Jim Nance

 
Matmlen Picked
T 0 Win Easterns

 

Syracuse and Navy loom as the biggest obstacles for
the Panther wrestling team as they seek their ﬁfth East-
ern title this weekend at‘ Lancaster, Pa.

Syracuse has the biggest group of outstanding per-
formers among the three teams, while Navy has the most
balance and the Panthers are somewhere in between the
two. '

Syracuse will probably have three favorites in the
tournament. NCAA and Eastern heavyweight king Jim
Nance is almost a sure champion for the Orange, even
though he must again beat 1962 titlist Ed Scharer of
Rutgers, while Dick Slutzky is a good bet at 157—pounds
and Terry Haise is a shaky favorite in the 123—pound class.

The Orange have two other performers who should
place in l37—pounder Jim Murrin and 177—pounder Lew
Roberts. Murrin was runnerup last year.

Navy’s best bets for titles are last year’s champion at
177-pounds Gerry Franzen and 137-pounder Wayne Hicks.
These two are backed up by dark horse candidates Dave

 

Gerry Franzen Bob Rader Ed Scharer

Carey at 167—pounds, Fred Crawford at 123-pounds, Bob

-Sanders at 147 pounds and Bo Wiley at 157-pounds.

Pitt’s biggest liability is their weakness at 19l—pounds
and heavyweight where Bill Beck .and Bill Bodle will
wrestle. It is doubtful if either will get past his ﬁrst
match. The 191-pound class will have one of three de-
fending champions in Rutgers’ Bob Rader, the other two
being Nance and Franzen. '

The Panthers’ strength lies with 130—pounder Mike
Johnson, who is an overwhelming favorite, 167-pounder
Lee Hall, 177-pounder Ken Barr and 137-pounder Frank

O’Korn. The latter three won’t be favored, but have ex-

cellent chances of winning titles.

Tom Heniﬁ, at 123-pounds, and Tom Baily, at_ 157-
pounds, have good chances of placing for theiPanthers.

The pre-tourney favorites and the wrestlers who will
probably be seeded ﬁrst are Haise, Johnson, Hicks, Doug
Koch of Lehigh, Slutzky, Marty Strayer of Penn State,
Franzen, John Gladish of Lehigh and Nance.

If these wrestlers turn out to be the winners it will
be a close tournament. But we don’t see it that way. We
see Pitt taking its ﬁrst title since 1960 in rather decisive
fashion.

Last year we picked six out of nine winners correctly
so we’ll try again this year. Our picks are Haise, Johnson,
O’Korn, Koch, Slutzky, Hall, Barr, Rader, and Nance. This
gives the Panthers four titles, the most they have ever
won. We’ll go one further and say Heniff and Baily will
increase the Panthers’ margin of victory by taking third
and fourth, respectively.

The Panthers haven’t won a title outright since 1956,
(they tied Penn State in 1960), but this year is their year.
They have the top individual performers to do it, plus
fairly good depth despite a very big weakness in the
upper weights. .

Timmons Counting on Scouting
Report for Help in Tournament

By ART FLEISCII-INER

How the Panther basketball team does

against Drake Saturday in the NIT could depend
upon Dudey Moore, former Duquesne coach and
now a high school teacher and part-time bas-
ketball. scout.
‘ Moore, who lives in the Philadelphia area,
sent a report to Panther coach Bob Timmons on
the Temple team earlier in the year. The
Panthers defeated the Owls, 78-67, at the Fitz-
gerald Field House.

If his report on Drake is as good as the one
on Temple, then Pitt will have a better chance
against the favored Bulldogs. Moore saw Drake
play three times in the Quaker City Tournament
over the Christmas vacation. Drake ﬁnished
third, losing to St. Bonaventure, another NIT
team.

Until Timmons hears from Moore, he will
continue to hold regular practices and scrim-
mages against the freshman team. Once the-re-
port isin, Timmons will concentrate the remain-
ing drills on neutralizing the Drake attack.

Looking at the Drake statistics, ‘however, one
comes to the conclusion that Timmons should
let the team do what they’ve been doing all sea-
son; that is, bring the ball down and shoot. The
Panthers have met few teams this year that have
ﬁve starters with as good a ﬁeld goal percentage
as they.

All ﬁve starters are averaging over 40 per
cent and all but Brian Generalovich are over 44
per cent. Pitt will have to have a good shooting
night to win because ‘Drake's defense is one of
the best in the country. .

The Bulldogs have permitted an average of
60.5 points per game while averaging only 67.5
on offense. Their defensive average ranks them
13th in the country. Most of the teams in the
Missouri Valley Conference, of which Drake is a
member, stress defense. Thus the Bulldog ‘offen-
sive average can be deceiving.

They use an olfense which publicity-man

Paul Morrison calls, "A controlled fast—break.”.
They prefer to set up their plays and probably

Awon’t run as much as the Panthers.

To try and hold the Panthers, who are aver-
aging 82 points a game, coach Maurice John will
probably use a man-to-man defense. “We have
used a zone defense at times this year,” said
John, “but we prefer the man-to-man.”

-John has been using seven men in the major-
ity of Drake’s games. Other team members have
seen limited services, a factor which could hurt
the Bulldogs if they. get intofoul trouble.

Evidently, Drake doesn’t get into much foul
trouble at home. Like the Panthers they won
all home contests. Counting the four they won
at the end of last season and the 13 they’ve won
this year, Drake has 17 consecutive wins on their
Des Moines, Iowa court.

All six of their losses this season have come
on the road. They have managed to win seven
games away from home. Their total of 20 vic-
tories set a school record. Each of their six
losses came to teams ranked in the top 20 with
the exception of Washington of St. Louis.

Washington defeated Drake, 75-68. The Bull-
dogs also lost ‘to Cincinnati, 161-55; Minnesota,
64-51; St. Bonaventure, 64-62; and twice to
Wichita, 67-49 and 58-50 in a playoﬁ last Friday.
They have beaten Wichita, Cincinnati, Temple
and Bradley twice.

As has been the case most of the time this
year, the Panthers will have a height disadvant-
age. Drake has 6-foot-6 McCoy McLemore and
6-foot-5 Gene Bogash at forwards, 6—foot-10
Larry Prims at center and 6—foot Billy Foster
and 6-foot-4 Gene West at guards.

Foster is the captain and the team’s high
scorer with a 13.9 average. McLemore is aver-
aging 14.9 points a game, but has played one
more contest. Two other starters are averaging
in double ﬁgures. They are West at 10.4 and
Bogash at 11.5.

Monday’s intramural

By BILL CABIN
basketball quarter-ﬁnal championshipswere

two of the best intramural games this season. Both Delta .Sigma Phi’s
victory over Pi Kappa Alpha and Winbrook’s defeat of the Industrial

Engineers were marked by good
slim margins of victory.

Delta Sig’s 35-27 defeat of Fraternity B champ, Pi Kappa Alpha,

defensive play, low scoring, and

was sparked unexpectedly by Barry Wetzel who scored 21 points.
Wetzel, a former Taylor Allderdice high star, had only averaged 10

A points per game prior to Monday.

Pi Kappa Alpha’s sharp defense held Delta Sig stars John Pig-
netti, Andy Alex, and Ralph Cappy to less than 10 points each. Pig-
netti, Alex, and Cappy had been averaging a combined total of 38
points per game, and Cappy and Pignetti were both placed on the

Fraternity A all—star team.
The PiKA’s held Delta Sig to

a 14-14 tie at half time, but they

couldn’t mount a persistent drive in the second half. Ed Miguelucci
paced Pi Kappa Alpha with 15 points, but he received no offensive

help from his teammates.

Winbrook defeated the Industrial Engineers, 42-34,, in the same
manner as Delta Sig defeated Pi Kappa Alpha. Winbrook was paced
by Cal Bonawitz and Jim Linta with 10 points each. This was only
Linta’s second game this year and Bonawitz had been averaging a

mere 5.5 points per game.

Fred Hoaglin and Jim Ferracco, who had averaged a com-
bined total of 36 points per game for Winbrook, were mufﬂed by
the Industrials’ defense and held to a combined total of less than

20 points.

The Industrials’ plight was much the same as Pi Kappa Alpha’s
because they played good defense, but failed to produce a strong

offensive drive. Bill Tener scored

none of his teammates scored above 8 points.

In the SU Supper Room

Lewis Blasts Political

Slavery in White South

By MARGIE DONALDSON

John Lewis, national chair-
-man of the Student Non-Vio-
lent Coordinating Committee,
spoke on “Why Freedom
Now” Friday noon in the SU
Supper Room.

Basic "changes must be made
now, because “political slavery”
still exists in many parts of the
South, Lewis pointed out. In
Mississippi alone, where there
are 400,000 adult Negroes, only
29,000 are registered voters.

SNCC advocates the idea of
"one man, one vote.” Since the
Negro has been denied the right
to education, Lewis said,
the only requirement for voting
should be age and residence.

Saturate State

The organization will put its
plans into high gear this sum-
mer in Mississippi. With an ex"-
pected group of 500-1000 stu-
dents working tor subsistence
wages, SNCC plans “to saturate”
the state with members to de-
velop “grass roots resistance” to
discrimination and leadership
among the “masses.” Lewis pre-
dicts a “hard, long summer in
Mississippi.”

SNCC, nicknamed “Snick,” is

a civil rights group, made up
mostly of students who accept
the principle of non—violence
as a philosophy or way of life.
Believing one “cannot separate.
the means from the end,” they
hope to bring about, through
non-violent means, the “be-
loved community, the open so-
ciety," where true integration
exists.

Lewis explained that their
policy is not just the absence of
violence, but rather the presence
of a driving good force. Since
“segregation is a radical evil,”
he told an audience of about 85,
a “counterforce of radical good”
_is needed. *

Mandate From History

He concluded by stating that
especially the young people of
today have a “mandate from his-
tory and from God Almighty” to
be willing to turn the nation,
especially the South, upside down
to ﬁnd peace and justice.

Chatham student Linda Watts,
chairman of the Pittsburgh
Friends of SNCC, -announced that
contributions should be mailed
to SNCC, 81/: Raymond St. N.W.,
Atlanta 14, Georgia.

- Frosh Council Planned
The last two activities planned
by the council at present are a
Freshmen Council and an Activi-
ties Fair. '

Once reorganized, the council
will be run by a coordinator,
vice-coordinator, and secretary-
treasurer. The officers will be
selected by a committee who
will interview all applicants.
Anyone wishing to apply for an
oﬂice can pick up his applica-
tion in the Dean of Men’s office,
502 SU. Applications must be
returned by Monday to the same
office.

The Council will be expanded at
a later date and applications for
other positions will be available

later in the month, Epstein con-
cluded.
