Walgren
, Opposes

Fulton

Doug Walgren. Democratic'
candidate for Congress from the
27th Congressional District.
will discuss "Students and Ag-
new‘s Rhetoric“ Wednesday at 1
p.m. in room 524 of the Student
Union. A question and answer per-
iod will foll'ow.

Walgren. a 29-year-old Mt,
Lebanon attorney. is opposing in-
cumbent Republican Congress-
man James Fulton. who has rep-

‘ “resented the South Hills. .\/IcKees

Rocks. and the South Side wards
for 26 years. -

A dove and a critic of the Nixon
administration. Walgren is anxi-
ous to obtain massive ‘student sup-
port for his campaign this fall. He
already has enlisted Pitt students

and Carnegie—Mellon students to

help him.

Although the Democratic Party
has a 36,000 registration edge in
the 27th Congressional District,
Fulton has consistently defeated
his opponents by wide margins.
Political analysts credit his suc-
cess to a career based on curry-
ing the favor of his constituents.

   

Chet Huntley

A face familiar to millions of
television viewers will make one
in a series of final public appear-
ances at the University before re-
tiring to a ranch in Montana.

On Dec. 1. the Campus Police
are scheduled to remove the word
“Police" from. the shoulder
badges of their uniforms and re-
place it with "Security." While
the administration is behind this
policy. the campus police are up-
set. Many of the officers on the
force are afraid that this move
will limit their power in dealing
with campus incidents and some
have suggested that the Pitts-
burgh Police will play a greater
role on the l.'niversity campus.

Petitions are currently being
circulated by the officers to have
this order rescinded.

Because the change may have
an effect on the University as a
whole. the Pitt News interviewed
a number of students to get their
opinions on the issue. Janet Mor-
gan. a sophomore. said. “I think
its better they remain policemen
so that the Pittsburgh Police won‘t
come on campus in case theres
trouble. The Campus Police are
very efficient and at the same
time nice.“

Another student commented
that “If anyone is in -favor of this
change, they just have a down
opinion of police in general.” Fay
Partovi, a Pitt student from Iran
stated that “the police in my coun-
try can come on our college cam-
puses at any time. I think it would
be better that they remain the
Campus Police.”

Pat Moscatello commented that

"l don‘t think that the Pittsburgh“

be the ones to control it in case of
trouble. If there is any real trou-
ble. the Pittsburgh Police could
easily be called in."

Several students were asked
how they felt about the limitation
of the campus polices power. and
the possibility of the Pittsburgh
Police coming on campus. Anton
lloffman. a Pitt undergrad. said.
"Id rather see campus police pro-
tecting me than the Pittsburgh po-
lice. The campus police do a bet-
ter job because they‘re not out to
bust kids but to protect them."

Another student, John Berez-
niek, when asked if he favored the
“Police” to “Security” change,

stated, “No!” He .qlial‘ified’ hi.sV“'{‘

  Parents Turned-On

by CHARLES CAMIC

Following Chancellor Wesley Posvar's reception Friday night. sev-
eral parents gathered to consider the problem of drugs on campus.

Dr. Herbert Barry. III, associate professor of Pharmacology‘:
Marc Hiller. chairman of Drug Seminars. and Lenny Klavonic. presi-
dent of Student Government, coordinated the discussion.

Dr. Barry described the effects of drugs on the human physiology.
"Drugs," he noted, “are dangerous because. by imitating the action of
various human hormones, they upset the delicate balance between
excitation and inhibition which nature achieves."

Citing new research, Barry maintained that an important distinc-
tion must be made among types of drug users. “The biggest difference
_ exists between heavy users and moderate users—not between users
'“ and non-users.” Heavy users, be explained, emonstrate “addictive per-

sonalities” which “would lead them to pills and liquor, were drugs not
accessible.” Needing to block something out of their lives, these peo-
ple turn to the most effective available means—drugs.

Arguing that the focus of the current widespread alarm about

‘ drugs is misplaced, Marc Hiller suggested that often student drug

are only “responding to the pill and liquor habits of their parents.“ “We

must break down barriers between the adult and student worlds. be-
fore'we reach real understanding of the drug problem.“ he maintained.

Though the communications media are concerned about drugs.

, Hiller contended that “inaccurate data and interpretations slant much

of what is reported." He concluded that while current research is "in-
conclusive, a lot of possibilities remain and should be explored.“

Lenny Klavonic, claiming that the “student government doesn’t
govern, but tries to form personal interrelationships,” suggested that
“relating is the key to the drug problem.” “Drug users, invariably,” he
continued, “seek to relate—to make up for something lacking in their
lives, to find, at times, a substitute for an inadequate mother or father.”

The drug problem is not unique to the campus. Klavonic argued.
"The highest drug rates are among those few who contacted drugs
while in high school."

He further advocated the legalization of marijuana. Emphasizing
the no’ conclusive studies have demonstrated that harmful effects of
that drug, he noted that usage "should be an individual choice."

Both Klavonic and Hiller stressed the efforts of the “service ori-

ented" student government to aid those seeking legal. financial and per-
sonal help. “Caring is important at Pitt.“ Klavonic concluded.

 
 

Posvaris Happy

by CHARLES CAMIC

Addressing a large audience at
the official opening of Parents
Weekend Friday night. Chancellor
Wesley Posvar described the
phases. of development which have
produced here a “happy universi-
ty family.“

Vice-Chancellor Bernard Kobo-
sky. who introduced Posvar and.
and several other administrators
also welcomed the parents.

 

  

\ “Through the combined efforts
of students, faculty, and adminis-
’ trators." Posvar stressed. “the _ 
University's athletic and academ-
ic promise is rising."

 

The physical expansion of the
University, course opportunities.
and government research pro-
grams "will increase at the great-
-est rate thus f'ar in the next five
years." the Chancellor explained.
The products of this growth. he.
suggested. will be “enriching to
the student."

While the University is “dedi-
cated to treating the students as
individuals,” Posvar argued,
“meaningful social units are dif-
ficult to achieve in the modern ur-

ICH Impedes Racism’

by JON POPOVICH

"The second term of junior
year I heard about the Intercul-
tural House. That's where my ed-
ucation started. It's an impossible
thing to verbalize to you the ex-
perience that I had. But I can say
that you need to emphasize the
word. culture. Because communi-
cation. that's what this world
functions upon——communication
with each other.

“'I‘here‘s a cultural barrier that
exists-—I‘m not talking axout
China; I'm not talking about Eur-
ope; I‘m not talking about big
cities; I'm not talking about New
England: I'm talking about across
the street. I'm talking about
where white folks live: I’m talk-
ing about where black folks live.
When I cam to the Intercultural
House. I found I had to learn a
new language. I had to learn new
words in order to get my friend to
pass the salt or turn down his
stereo.

So said Wendell Walls. a white
senior and boarder in the Inter-
cultural «ICr House. where 20
male students. several foreign
and .the rest from the U.S.. half
white and half black. "learn to
(-ommunicate——communicate val-
ues. a feeling for each'person‘s
spiritual and cultural origins." as
the pamphlet describes.

Thediscussion of the IC House
and of “Racism and the Univer-
sity” was part of Parent’s Week-
end. Fifteen parents were there,
six of them black, to hear Walls

tation. the Men‘s Glee Club per-

rent university problems.

and Chenits Pettigrew, a student
admissions officer.

Pettigrew. a black. talked about
the eye-opening experience of the
Lniversity itself: “Most individ-
uals. be they black or white fresh-
men. come and they do change.
They are residents of this com-
munity and they become visitors
to you. because they only come
home—if they‘re not commuters
—Christmas. Thanksgiving. Eas-
ter and summer. So. Ive heard
many times: ‘When I go home. I
have to cut my hair. I have to keep
my mouth shut. and carry a hot
water bottle full of ice to keep my-
self cooled off because my eyes
have begun to be opened to differ-
ent things and new ideas and if I
go home and talk about them. Dad
will say no more money.”

.Morality Put

by LORETTA HORRELL

"Is the University actually su-
pervising a dormitory in which a
male and female live together?"
asked a concerned parent Friday
evening. Oct. 4. at 8:30 in 324
Cathedral of Learning.

The topic. "New Morality—Col—
lege Style" aroused the interests
of many anxious parents who went
to the discussion group which was
guided by Dr. Joseph Hinchliffe.
director and chief psychiatrist of
the-Student Health Service; Mrs.
Patricia Gaylor. RN. director of
nursing at the Student Health
Service. and Chuck Carlson. Lu-
theran clergyman for the Uni-
versity.

Of major interest to the parents
were co-educational h o u s i n g.
teaching methods of professors.
and violence on campus.

Many parents, having been mis-
informed about McCormick Hall’s
co-ed dormitory, were under the
impression that male and female
students were living together un-
der the supervision of the Univer-
sity.

Parents were also concerned
with the exposure of their chil-
dren to various occurences. such
as “the smoking of pot. drunken
men in the halls. and girls who are
supposedly selling themselves" in
the dormitories.

“Only those people who want to
live in the co-ed dorm are there.“
said Dr. Hinchliffe in an attempt
to eliminate the idea that students
have no choice as to where they
can live. “If University housing
was unacceptable to parents. they
had the option of letting their child
live in an apartment." stated one
student.

Teaching methods of profes-
sors, having been brought into the
discussion of morality, indicated
that a few parents fear their chil-
dren are being exposed to “pro-

Walls talked about a cultural
problem as the essence of racism.
"Thats why our House is an In-
tercultural House. . . . Its the so-
lution to racism. Racism is some-
thing you won't find at the Inter-
cultural House."

Pettigrew talked about the
Black Studies program. “Black
Studies is open to everyone and
everyone here in this institution
ought to avail themselves of some
of the learning experiences in
out look and ideas that are involv-
ed in that area.”

Walls agreed, "The Black
Studies program as I see it is ben-
eficial to black people. Because
not only does it help make up the
cultural-educational gap that they

fessors who are radicals.” With
the exposure to the same profes-
sor three hours a week, it is be-
lieved by some parents that their

professors says as gospel.

Mr. Carlson remarked. “Edu-
cation is not entirely concerned
with who is giving the answers. as
it is with who is helping the stu-
dents raise appropriate ques-
tions."

Violence on campus. which was
attributed to a small group of
students who are able to arouse
the apathetic students into action.
is a bad influence to the “moral
students." In an "attempt to ex-
plain why students are coerced to
use violence. Mr. Carlson said.
“Many accept violence as a meth-
od of solving problems. It is often
a matter of trying to get attention
or ofbeing heard.“

The question of new morality on
the college campus may or may
not have been answered. but it
seems that the question the par-
ents were actually posing was

“Who't to blame for what college?

  Scranton Team Hits On Student Problems

by LENNY KLAVONIC

Recently the President‘s Com-
mission on Campus Unrest, head-
ed by former Pennsylvania Gov-
ernor William Scranton, released
its findings after weeks of in-
tensive interviewing and studies
dealing with the problem. The
following are some of the major
findings and recommendations of
the Commission :

Most student protestors are
neither violent nor extremist.
But a small minority of politi-
cally extreme students and facul-
ty members and a small group of
dedicated agitators are bent on
destruction of the university
through violence in order to gain
their own political ends. Per-
petrators of violence must be
identified. and removed from the
university by agencies of law
enforcement.

Dissent and peaceful protest
are a valued part of this nations
way of governing itself. Violence
and disorder are the antithesis
of democratic processes and can-
not be tolerated either on the na-
tion‘s campuses or anywhere
else.

The roots of student activism
lie in unresolved conflicts in
our national life. but the many
defects of the universities have
also fueled campus unrest.

Universities have not adequate-
ly prepared themselves to re-
spond to disruption. They have
been without suitable plans.
rules. or sanctions. Some admin-
istrators and faculty members
have responded irresolutely.
Frequently. announced sanctions
have not been applied. Even
more frequently. the lack of ap-
propriate organization within the
university has rendered’ its res-
ponse ineffective. The univer-
sity's own house must be placed
in order.

Too many students have acted
irresponsibly and even dangerous-
ly in pursuing their stated goals
and expressing their dissent. Too
many law enforcement officers
have responded with unwarrant-
ed harshness and force in seek-
ing to control disorder. Ac-

tions-and inactions-of government
at all levels have contributed to
campus unrest. The words of
some political leaders have help-
ed to inflame it. Law enforce-
ment officers have too often re-
acted ineptly. or overreacted.
At times, their response has de-
generated into uncontrolled vio-
lence. -

The nation has been slow to re-
solve the issues of war and race.
which divide American society
and which have contributed to
the escalation of student protest
and disorder.

All of us must act to prevent
violence. to create understanding.
and to reduce bitterness and hos-
tility that divide both the camp-
us and the country. We must es-
tablish respect for the processes
of law and tolerance for the ex-
ercise of dissent on our campus-
es and in the nation.

Based upon the above observa-
tion and findings the report made
specific recommendations for
rational and responsive measures
to be taken to alleviate present
situations in the country. The
recommendations are "addressed
to those who have the vested
power or responsible interests to
carry them out.

FOR THE PRESIDENT

We urge that the President ex-
ercise his reconciling moral
leadership as the first step to
prevent violence and create un-
derstanding. It is imperative
that the President bring us to-
gether before more lives are lost.
more property destroyed and more
universities disrupted.

We recommend that the Presi-
dent seek to convince public of-
ficials and protestors alike that
divisive and insulting rhetoric is
dangerous. In the current poli-
tical campaign and throughout
the years ahead. the President
should insist that no one play
irresponsible politics with the
issue of “campus unrest."

We recommend that the Presi-
dent take the lead in explaining to

the American people the under--

lying causes of campus unrest and
the urgency of our present sit-
uation.

We recommend that he arti-
culate and emphasize those val-
ues all Americans hold in com-
mon. At the same time we urge
him to point out the importance
of diversity and coexistence to the
nations health. To this end. noth-
ing is more important than an
end to the war in Indochina. Dis-
affected students see the war as
a symbol of moral crisis in the
nation which. in their eyes. de-
prives even law of it‘s legiti-
macy. Their dramatic reaction to
the Cambodian invasion was a
measure of the intensity of their
moral recoil.

We urge the President to re-
new the national commitment to
full social justice. and to be
aware of increading charges of
repression. We recommend that
he take steps to see to it that the
words and deeds of government do
not encourage belief in those
charges.

We recommend that the Presi-
dent take steps to assure that he

be continuously informed of the
views of students and Blacks. im-
portant constituencies in this na-
tion.

We recommend that the Presi-
dent call a series of national
meetings designed to foster under-
standing among those who are
now divided. He should meet
with the governors of the states,
with university leaders. with law
enforcement officers, and with
Black and student leaders. Each
participant in these meetings
should be urged to bring with him
practical suggestions for restor-
ing trust and responsibility among
those whom he represents, and
commit himself to continue this
process of national reconcilation
in frequent meetings throughout
the school year. '

FOR GOVERNMENT

As the President. all govern-
ment officials should offer re-
conciling leadership to reunite the
nation. so all levels work to bring
our hostile factions together.
Governors of the states should
hold meetings and develop con-
tacts throughout the year to fur-
ther the cause of reconciliation.
Other federal. state and local of-
ficials must be sensitive to the
charge of repression and fashion
their words and deeds in a man-
ner designed to refute it.

We urge state and local offi-
cials to make plans for hand-
ling campus disorders in full co-
operation with states to estab-
lish guidelines setting forth more
precisely the circumstances that

justify ordering the Guard to in-
tervene in a campus disorder.

We urge public officials to re-.

ject demands that entire univer-
sities be punished because of the
ideas of excesses of some mem-
bers, and to honor their respon-
sibility to help preserve acade-
mic freedom.

We recommend greatly in-
creased financial aid for Black
colleges and universities. All
agencies of government that sup-
port such institutions should mas-
sively increase their grants to en-
able these colleges to overcome
past shortcomings. At the same
time government should increase
its financial support of higher
education.

     Editorial

 Shortly after the slaying of four Kent State students by Ohio
 V National Guardsmen early in May. the adm_inistration decided to
j‘ .1 ‘establish a Citizenship Information Center (CIC) and institute an
 Election Recess, to promote student involvement in the political

" " process. E

I"  ' -'1 -If student disaffection with “the system" was high five months

, l.}__‘_ -' ago‘, it was surely not been lessened by the University‘s unpardon-
. ~ '-able delay in making the CIC operational. '

g 5 - At Carnegie-Mellon University. an organization comparable to
 g“_:;-ithe -CIC has been functioning for months. At Pitt. newly appointed
“ _ ' _..j members of the CIC Board met for the first time on Friday of last

7 fweek.

,_-.~ ’ 3' ‘ ONLY ONE month remains until Election Day. Incredibly

  »: enough, the director of the CIC has yet to be appointed. The ClC‘s

 -« headquarters have yet to be established. And the CIC Board has

_  Q thus far taken no action to fulfill one of its primary functions—to fa-

‘ ‘ff-"  ’»ci;litate the political education and involvement of students this fall.

'1‘  Whileisome’ maintained months ago that the CIC was a sop.
’ tossed to students by administrators anxious to quell student dis-

  

’ , Our confidence. however, seems to have been misplaced. If the
, -  administration is sincere, why has it stalled? If the CIC is to be more

‘j  than a mere symbol of University concern, why was its board ap-
-‘ .- if  pointed at the eleventh hour? Why has a room in the Student Union
'  ~not yet been set up for it. despite the fact that Chancellor Posvar
~‘ urged “Vice-Chancellor Kobosky to take care of the matter over two
fi 1 . weeks ago?

Following the Revolutionary War. the first
nominating caucus for a presidential candiate was
held in New York City_in 1812. At that time. the
Republican-Democratic dual parties selected
James Madison as their choice. History provides
the outcome.

A century and a‘ half later. we still honor the
practice of scheduling nomination rites periodical-
ly. But the working coalition of the 19th century
has diminished into a system based -on splinter

ties.

Formerly. the two major. traditional parties
were able to sustain internecine conflicts center-
ing around ideological differences and personality
battles. But present conditions and the fruitof an

education-oriented philosophy have produced a na- A

tion which is growing more and ‘more politically
unstable. '

SHUCKING THE pinions of his Republican af-
filiates. Mayor John Lindsay was elected to his of-
fice on the Liberal Progressive ticket. The strict-
ly conservative element of the confederation has
fissionedoff. Perhaps. for the first time in mod-
ern political reality. the Conservative Party of
New York cannot be disregarded as a threat in its
endorsement of James Buckley for the office of
U.S. Senator.

Now according to two representatives from a
Youth Socialist Alliance in Boston. the Socialist
candidate for the Senate there. is more vocal and

powerful in his appeal that has been the ‘case

the past for that faction. ‘

George Wallace‘s “Independent Party" and its _

psychological successes in the South have be-

groups and a marked proliferation of political par-~

 

come a prime target for the intended candidacy
assassinations of Spiro Agnew.

ANOTHER OFF-SHOT aspect of the germinat-
ing part_v population is the internal splits that have
lately characterized the major organizations.

While verbally thrashing the radical—lib~eral
"parasites? of the Democratic party. the VP is
indirectly pushing interests of Democratic candi-

dates that reflect Nionite orientation and simul— ..

taneously attempting to destroy by omission the‘-
re-election efforts of Goodell in New York.

The Democratic apparatus. on the other hand.
is experiencing schisms as evidenced by the re-
cent events in Pittsburgh with Mayor Flaherty and
Byrd Brown.

SIMILAR CONDITIONS in other nations. es-
pecially those conspicuously modeled after our
own. reflect what they have produced. France and
its well-known strifes. underline the political
chaos born of numerous parties and competing
factions. .

The Latin American states. almost to the last

one. are marked by domestic woes and frequent
coups.

Political theorists have predicted that the
most advanced technological systems are pre-
dominantly duo-party. One proposes the theory. L --

‘wards "the mellowing of the society" and stability."

THE OTHER side of the coin affirms that mul-

-ti-partied systems produce unstable governments

and lay the group workfor coup d'etats and revolu-
tions.

“Getting it together" “must be the formula for
preserving our present structures. or as Marx be-
lieved: "Capitalist countries are destroyed of
themselves."

‘ ‘  IF THE administration is not in-sincere. then there appears only
'  :-‘ "one other possible explanation—that administrators at this Univer-

¥ sides we are less concerned with past failures than the urgent de- '

by HARRIS MILLER

In a little over five weeks. the
voters of Pennsylvania will once
again return to the polls to elect‘
a governor. a senator. congress-
man. and state legislators.

The purpose of this column is
not to endorse‘ any particular
candid'ate for any of the particu-
lar offices being contested nor to
even advocate activity in Penn-
sylvania electoral politics.

Rather. the purpose is to re-
mind students and employees of
the University that in five
months the state of Pennsyl-
vania will come to the end of its
stop-gap appropriations and will
be unable. both financially and
by law. to continue operations.

IMPLICIT in this reminder is
the fact that the University is
state-related. meaning that it de-

  0/4 éampus llrzrcst

pends on the state for close to 40

per cent /of its budget. and the

fact that state scholarships as
well as University scholarships
are directly related to the states
finances. I

This is not meant to be an eso-
teric enjoinder but rather a
pragmatic reminder that stu-
dents. for very selfish reasons.
must make a decision. and soon.
whether they will participate in
Electoral Politics ‘70.

Certainly there are many fac-
tors in any such decision. Are
there really candidates who will
work to se_e that this state and
this University are properly
managed fiscally? Can any of
these candidates win?*If these
candidates win. can they really
make a dent in the archaic. bu-
reacratic structure that"engulfs.
and is. state government? Can I.

as an idealistic student. put up
with the trival mumblings of
candidates as long as they will
help to right the financial crisis?

BUT even these factors must
take a back seat to the basic

question. "Can I simply ignore _

politics if it may mean another
financial crisis and even the end
of my University schooling?”

I do not claim to have an an-

swer to these questions. I do
claim. however. that these ques-
tions are worthyiof considera-
tion. if for only a few moments.

And I also claim that if one
sees electoral politics as being
an /important endeavor in this
election year for the very selfish
reason I mentioned above. then
one must get involved now while
it is conceivably still early
enough to make a difference.

After the disaster last spring at. Kent State. the
President authorized a commission. headed by
former Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton.
to investigate campus unrest and present specific
recommendations to him.

The Scranton Commission urged that the Pres-
ident try to convince public officials of the danger
of insulting rhetoric. "In the current political cam-
paign." it.pointed out. "the President should in-
sist that no one play irresponsible politics with the
issue of campus unrest." ’

ALTHOUGH I feel that it is hitting below the
belt to say anything about our Vice—President. he
is a prime offender of this recommendation.‘

I Another bone of contention that is presented 
the Scranton Commission stems from the recom-
mendation that the President "reknew the nation-

‘ al commitment to full social justice. and be aware

of increasing charges of repression. Rather than

n . becoming aware of the charges—of-’repressi’on. but .

suggestive of repression was the permission given
to the Internal Revenue Service to search through
public libraries for persons borrowing books con-

explosives. ‘

The war goes on. The United States continues
to commit itself to the point of military action
around the world. Black Panther headquarters are
raided continuously. and the Presidents Commis- -
sion on Campus Unrest makes its report. then

fades into oblivion.

IT PUZZLES me why the President would au-
thorize such a commission. finance intensive re-
search. and then. all butignore the work which the
commission had done. Maybe the campus unrest
is just a reflection of the unrest faced by theentire
nation—an unrest stemming from an unpopular

 I'm No Marxist;
Read It closely

Editor, The Pitt News:

On Monday, I picked up the
Sept. 28 edition of The Pitt
News and when I read page five

0 I saw a letter with the title “Writ-

ers Hit on ‘Marxism."'

I began to read the letter and it
was with considerable amaze-
ment that I found the letter to be
a reply to one or both my letters
(which appeared on Sept. 14 and
Sept. 21) in which I criticized a
letter and an article by Frank
Donatelli.

I might add that I made no men-
tion whatsover of Marxism in my
letters but, of course, this did not
prevent the writer from attack-
ing me for it. At this point, I stop-
ped reading the letter and, very
bewildered. said to myself, “Good
Lord, where in hell could reason-
ing like this be acceptable?"

Then I looked to the bottom of
the letter where I saw “Jack E.
Simmons, member YAF” and
suddenly I knew where such rea-
soning is acceptable. To borrow
one of Mr. Simmons own sen-
tences “ones does not know
whether to laugh or to cry."

Mr. Simmons seems to think
that I am a Marxist. This is false.
Second, Mr. Simmons seems to
think that I am a member of SDS.
This also is false. Third, Mr. Sim-
mons states, “Mr. McDonough
objects to Mr. Donatelli's claim
that the left lives in a dream
world."

I ask Mr. Simmons to show us
where I state that objection. What
I did state was that, in the same
article, Donatelli accused the left
of being insane and then a few
lines later, expressed his desire
to listen to other opions.

STUDENTS ARE NEEDED
to assist in collecting a ques-
tionnaire which will be distrib-
uted during registration for the
winter term. Any reliable stu-
dents who are available to work
for several hours a day during
the registration period starting
October 18 and continuing thru
until the end of the fall term
are urged to call Gail Hom-
stein, Ext. 453, 4543 or come to
the College of Arts and Scienc-
es Office, 917 C.L. to sign up.

Students will be paid $2.00
an hour for their services!

 

I pointed out that these state-
ments were inconsistent in that a
man who is willing to listen to the
opinions of his opponents does not
call his opponents insane.

As it should be clear on this sec-
ond reading, Mr. Simmons, my
letter in no way committed me to
objecting to Donatelli‘s claim.
Furthermore, it should be clear
to anyone who possesses even the
most meager intelligence that in
neither of my articles was I de-
fending Marxism. revolution. or
revolutionaries.

I was defending one individual.
Don Marbury. from the irrevalent
abuse of Frank Donatelli. The only
hint of my political leanings came
in the Sept. 14 issue where I said.
“Does Donatelli ever find it in-
teresting that the seeds of pro-
gressive social change and revolu-
tion are to be found foremost in
our nations institutions of learn-
ing?"

It might be noted that the rea-
son I posed the above as a ques-
tion is because I', not being born
omniscient like Mr. Simmons, do
not know the answer to this ques-
tion. I have my ideas but I do not
find the issues so simple as does
Mr. Simmons.

The following is an attempt to
explicate the argument in Sim-

mon‘s letter which goesas fol-
lows:  . . the left can in some
sense be characterized as Marx-
ist" and "Marxists do live in a
dream world." The conclusion is
that leftists live in a dream world.

But the obvious question is “In
what sense can the left be char-
acterized as Marxist?" Is Sim-
mons making a statistical claim
to the effect that most leftists are
Marxists? If he is. then he is sure-
ly wrong and besides, if he'were
right, his argument would ‘be to
the effect that Marxists (not‘left-
ist) live in a dream world. Thus.
at best his argument is irrelevant

and at worst it is wrong. Or is he '
_ making a conceptual cliam—that

the concept of being a leftist
somehow includes that of being
a Marxist. But that claim is false
too.

There is nothing incompatilble
about being a leftist and not being
a Marxist. I

As regards Mr. Simmons offer
to debate me, I must decline for
the following reasons: First, I too
have an extremely busy schedule.
and I have been plagued with ill-
ness this term (my illness has not
been mental. to the ultimate dis-
may, I am sure. of Simmonds and
Donatelli).

Second, I think Mr. Simmons
could spend the time he would

Monday, October 5, l970—THE PITT NEWS—Page 5

 

ha-ve spent preparing for the de-
bate more profitably by enrolling
in a remedial reading course.

Third, I doubt that many peo-
ple would be interested in hearing
an ignorant undergraduate (me)
debate an ignorant omniscient un-
dergraduate (Simmons).

Fourth, I presume Mr. Sim-
mons intended to debate me on
Marxism. But since I am not the
Marxist he thinks I am it would be
a dull debate with both of us
agreeing.

-   Anti-Semitism
Editor. The Pitt News:

Exactly what does Mark Cohen
mean in his article “To be ‘Right’
Is To Be Wrong” which appeared
in Thursday's (Sept- 23) Pitt
News by his use of the term
“Zionist”? The context it is used
in smacks of "anti-Semitism.

He also attempts to picture the
Palestian guerilla movement as a
noble movement which com-
mands “wide support among the
masses of people in Jordan.” His
mind appears to be closed, how-
ever, ‘to the fact that the guerillas
are terrorist thugs who blow up
school buses filled with Israeli
children, and whose sole purpose

- in life is the total destruction of

the State of Israel.

Mr. Cohen and his other pseu-

do-intellectual anti-Semitic liberal '

friends would do well to try to un-

derstand the true nature of the

Mid-East conflict instead of blindr 4

ly accepting left-wing propagan-
da.

Role 0 ndiviclua

J “T WER of excellence IS overwlmmg.”

by TOM HEIPLE

“I don’t like war, but I like warriors." That quote by Martin Luther
King sums up Brigadier General Daniel “Chappie" James’ speech last
Friday in Stephen Foster Memorial. In the speech he expressed his opti-
mistic views “of overcoming racial barriers but within the system."

He used his own personal success story as an example. Whatever

he did he gave it all he had because “the power of excellence is over-

whelming.” He worked within the system because more problems can
be solved by being on top than by throwing bricks on the bottom.

He then talked of a previous
engagment where a
reading had been substituted for
the original program. He gave an
excerpt from the reading. “The
world is dark. I live in a dark
world. Two-thirds of the world
goes hungry.‘ But, we (the stu-
dents) accept responsibility to
create change in our time for the
better."

According to James, “There

has been progress. The task is not

unsolvable. ’ ’

He then gave what. would have
been his version of the reading
when he lived in the ghetto. “My
street is dark. I live on a dark
street. My street is dark because
I am dark. The street lights stop
where the white neighborhood
stops, three blocks up. The pave-
ment stops where the white neigh-
borhood stops. The sidewalk stops
there, where the white neighbor-
hood stops. Somebody reminds me
I am not equal because I am

black. Two-thirds of the world is ,

hungry. I’m hungry; for opportun-
ities, justice, equality, and a,
chance. But, I am fortunate be-
cause I have faith."

Many whites contend that

blacks should pull themselves up
by their bootstraps. “But," ac-
cording to James. “they couldn't
pull themselves up by their boot-
straps, because they didn’t have
any boots. They were barefoot."
James explained that “this type
of insensitivity led too many peo-
ple to turn away from the prob-
lems of the ghetto.“

He said that “many people
would like to see right done but
they couldn’t or wouldn’t.” He ad-
mitted that “the government is

not doing enough fast enough but.

it is doing something. It will work
harder because of more pres-
sure.” What kind of pressure was
not mentioned. As for his neigh-
borhood, “there are lights on the

street now. The roads are paved.” ‘

However, Pprogress has been de-
layed by people who are polariz-
ing instead of grasping for unity.’-’
He denied that blacks were be-
ing sent to Vietnam on purpose
“to get them out of the way.“
Blacks outnumber whites per-
centage-wise because the army
fora long time was the only place
where blacks could get ahead due
to the social inequalities in our
society. Many blacks volunteered

  

for the so—called elite grous. us-
ually because of the extra money.

When fighting would break out,
these elite groups would be the
firstto get involved, which is one
explanation for the high casualty
rate among blacks.

He was asked what his views
were concerning the Afro—Ameri-
can “look." “I believe if he wants
to wear it, let, him. One should
judge him by what he is, not what
he wears. Black pride is a won-
derful thing, not black’separat-
ism.

Bombing and arson pose an in-

FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

We urge that peace officers
be trained and equipped to deal
with campus disorders, firmly,
justly and humanely. They must

Lantern Night, the oldest Pitt
tradition for freshman women
will be held on Sunday at 7
and 8:30 p.m. The cremony,
which began in 1921, will be
conducted in the Stephen Fos-
ter Memorial and the Com-
mons Room of the Cathedral.

Lantern Night, sponsored by
Associated Women Students
and the Alumni Association,
signifies the initiation of fresh-
man women to the community
of Pitt women.

Linda Oswald, Terri Weaver
and Roy Kenny will participate
in the ceremony.

At the ceremony, each fresh-
man recieves a lantern as a
gift from the Pitt Alumnae. The
candlelight ceremony is sym-

eds passing onto the incoming

for campus disturbances. We
urge police forces to improve
their capa city to respond to

-civil disorders.

Sending civil authorities on to
a college campus armed as if for
war—armed only to kill-has
brought tragedy in the past. If
this practice is not changed, tra-
gedy will come again. Shoulder
weapons are very rarely needed
on the college campus; they
should not be used except as em-
ergency equipment in the face of
sniper fire or armed resistance
justifying them.

We recommend that National
Guardsmen receive much more
training in controlling civil dis-
turbances. During the last three
years, the Guard has played al-
most no role in Southeast Asia,
but has been called to intervene
in civil disorders at home more
than 200 times. We urge that the
National Guard be issued special
protection equipment appro-
priate for use in controlling‘civ—
il disorder, and that it have suf-
ficient tactical capability and
non-lethal weaponry so that it
will use deadly force only as the
absolute last resort.

The Commission has been im-
pressed and moved by the ideal-
ism and commitment of Ameri-
can youth. But this extraordinary
commitment brings with it ex-
traordinary obligations; to learn
from our nation’s past experience,
to recognize the humanity of those
with whom they disagree, and
to maintain their respect for the
rule of law. The fight for change
and justice is the good fight; to
drop out or strike out at the first
sign of failure is to insure that
change will never come.

People Happen At

University Center

by NANCY RUTHER
and KATHY McCANN

Don‘t look now. but religion.
that anachronism of the college
campus. is alive and well at the
Lutheran University Center.

Located at 4515 Forbes Ave..
the center advocates a vital ap-
proach to Christianity.

Chairman of‘ the Center, Char-
les Carlson, expressing his phil-
osophy of religion, said that
“Traditionally, organized religion
has assumed that man is basic-
ally sinful, corrupt, and guilt-
ridden. We proceed from the hy-
pothesis that man is an interest-
ing creature where the image of
God may still exist.

..Our aim is to reduce the neu-
rotic hang-ups of students. To-
day’s students are really fearful—
afraid of the cosmos.”

On weekend nights the Luther-
an Center sponsors the Crumb-
ling Wall Coffee House, the name
signifying “crumbling walls" be-
tween people. Mr. Carlson des-
cribes the coffee house as “a
contact point where students can
find an alternative to violence,
a low pressure atmosphere where
the tensions created by interac-
tions are minimized.”

      

In an effort to bring the com-
munity into the University Cen-
ter, Carlson organized a week-
day fifty—cent lunch program. "A
group of adult women prepare
and serve the meals—soup, sand-
wich. beverage and dessert. It’s
very traditional, nineteenth cen-
tury, but-—it works! The group
we serve numbers about 150 and
is a more diverse. slightly older
group than at the coffee house."

When Carlson came to the Lu-
theran Center in 1958, he consid-
ered it “a very structured, self-
conscious organization with all
the advantages and disadvantag-
es of the in-group. “

Things have changed. The
card-carrying type of member-
ship is gone, and now the core
group fluctuates. It consists of
young people of varied religious
backgrounds who foment study
groups and seminars.

Carlson describes the develop-
ment of programs as having “no
preconceived ideas of what should
happen when.“

Those involved at the Lutheran
University Center make many
things happen——counseling ser-
vice, retreats, and sensitivity ses-
sions. Above all, according to the
Chairman, .‘ ‘People happen here!"

Fourth In A Series

Luckless City Simulated

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

It was not a particularly good week for the city. The Human Relations Commission, charged with
preventing the city’s pending racial explosion. wallowed in a sea of slander. The Governor, fearing all-
out racial warfare. declared martial law and order in the National Guard. The Mayor suffered a severe
heart attack and died. -

Fortunately, the luckless city doesn‘t really exist. and the series of calamities occurred only as part
of a simulation set up by stu-
dents in CAS 15, Urban and
Neighborhood Systems. taught
by Brian Vargus and Doug White.
Though none of it actually hap-
pened. Sociology Professor Var-
gus reminds that “it all might

The purpose of this and other
simulations and also the aim of
the course is to enable students
to unravel the complexities of ur-
ban life. “With these simula-
tions,” explained Vargus,” we’ve
given the student several ways
of looking at political decision-
making within the city. Later on,
they'll put other models of ur-
ban behavior to the test.”

One model proposes that group
identification within a city is
strongest at the community or
neighborhood level, and, subse-
quently, the neighborhood is the
focal point of basic social ac-
tion.

“It’s a way of looking at the
city from the bottom up," said
Vargus, who admitted that this
method might be far off base.

“We don‘t know exactly what
we’ll find, or if this model is at
all accurate. It will be as much
of a learning experience for Pro-
fessor White and myself as it will
be for the students."

As part of that learning pro-
cess, studentx will examine care-
fully selected neighborhoods, hop-
ing to actually delineate the
boundaries of the neighborhoods
while determining such factors
as ethnicity and racial and reli-
gious make-up. With the aid of
computers, students will analyze
their data, and should they dis-
cover any ‘inconsistancies, ‘they
may amend the model.

The models and the structure
for CAS 15 were designed dur-
ing the summer by Vargus, An-
thropology Professor White, and
a committee seeking to establish
an undergraduate Urban Affairs
program at the University. Two
courses are set to follow CAS 15
in the "fledgling program, and
some students are presently Ur-
ban Affairs majors.

These courses, as does CAS
15, are likely to require active -
student participation in areas
other than classroom’ discussion.
CAS 15 students responded al-
most to well to what was for
many, their first experience in
simulation.

THE 24th INTERNATIONAL Series at Pittsburgh, which opened a week
ago, promises to be one of the most exciting cultural series ever presented
in Pittsburgh. last Tuesday the Series presented the Moiseyev Dance Com-
pany in the Syria Mosque and broke the long-standing house re ord by
grossing over $30,000 for the single performance.

last Saturday evening, Oct. 3, the world's greatest guitarist Carlos
Montoya gave his annual performance at Carnegie Music Hall. It was Sen-
or Montoya's only appearance of the season in Pittsburgh and he was
the only guitaristto appear here during 1970-71. He presented a new
program of flamenco which included some of his old favorites.

Will she be proud or embarrassed when friends ask
where you bought her diamond? And, will you be
embarrassed about the price you paid for the quality
received? Today, there are no “bargains” in diamonds.
You save no more—often lose—when you try to cut
corners. Your knowledgeable American Gem Society

The simulation of the Human

threat, and the intrusion of the
National Guard. An especially
intense game-player, incensed
at the raucous goings on, aimed
an umbrella at the Chairman’s
chest, claiming that if a riot
could be simulated, so could a
rifle, whereupon he “shot” the *
Chairman.

Vargus, who usually lets the

was forced to resurrect the slain
Chairman. “A real meeting

swarming with policemen. “You’d
never have gotten your rifle

PITT TRAINERS walk quarterback Dave Havern off the field, late in the sec-
ond quarter of Saturday's Pitt-KSU football game. Havern suffered a "bruis-
ed hip and was replaced by‘Tom Hasbach who led the team to two T'Ds.

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

After Pitt defeated Kent State
Saturday. a reporter was asking
Denny Ferris about the eye in-
jury he suffered a few summers
ago while working on a construc-
tion job. ‘

The injury forced Ferris to red-
shirt one year. but if there was any
doubt about the top Panther tail-
back's sight. the doubt would have
disappeared during Saturdays 60
minutesof football. ‘

"I have no problems at all see-
ing the ball." Ferris told the re-
porter who should have believed
the Panther. Minutes before Fer-
ris could see well enough to catch
passes and run for 53 yards. and

the Kent State defenders saw 137 ,

yards rushed against them by the
Panthers‘ version of the‘ Pinto.

“Pinto” is Ferris’ nickname
among the players and the press
who witnessed the game against
Kent wouldn’t argue with the use

.of the name which signifies fleet-

ness of foot. They named Ferris

the game’s outstanding player.

After only a few plays—one a
big gainer—one of the writers de-
cided and proclaimed. “This is
Dennys game." It wasn't an un-

expected comment. as underhead

coach Carl DePasqua every game
seems to "belong" to a Panther
on offense and that Panther
seems to change every week.

An explanation could be that
DePasqua believes in going with
something that is producing.
Thats why the Panthers rushed
on after play in the second half

Saturday against Kent.

The plays to Ferris earlier in the
game were working well as—if
not better than—any play the Pan-

_ ther used, as Ferris combined to-

tal of 190 yards indicates.

"I never had any idea I'd be

With the injuries to quarter-
backs John Hogan and Dave Hav-
ern, going to a running back with
the short pass makes sense to De-
Pasqua. The success of the Pitt
ground attack also makes it easi-
er to choose Ferris over Pitt’s
other fine receivers, like Steve
Moyer and Joel Limek.

The screen to Ferris. in fact.
was the big weapon- for the Pan-
ther offense last-year.

Saturday. it was‘ pitchouts.

 ‘Painfully’

by JERRY MYERS

Prior to Saturdays Pitt—Kent
State football contest. which the
Panthers won. 27-6. Coach Carl
l)ePasqua warned that the Gold-
en Flashes would give the Cats 60
minutes of tough football. and the
Panthers ended up paying for ev-
ery one of those minutes.

Struggling to retain their su-
premacy for three quarters. the
Panthers finally blasted the game
wide open in the fourth quarter
with the last two of their four
touchdowns. But by the time the
final whistle blew. a host of cas-
ualties spotted the Cats second
win of the season.

"We're ragged.“ said DePas—
qua immediately following the
game. "were really chopped up
injury-wise. "They (Kent State)
have an extremely fine football
team_with some great personnel.
but you don't get the complete pic-
ture of us offensively. We're play-
ing on a shoestring.“

DePasqua was referring to the
awesome injury problem that
confronts the Panthers. As a re-

sult of Saturday’s victory, Pitt’s

back-up quarterback, Dave Hav-
ern, is out with a bruised hip;
Jack Dykes, hard-hitting right de-
fensive end is sidelined with a se-
vere leg injury; Dick Oldshue,
tough left defensive end, is hurt-

  
  

ris then raced 34 yards with ap-
parent ease. needing only one
good block. which Bruce Harkie—
wicz provided.

'Ferris‘didn’t think running_
against Kent was all that easy,
though.

“No." he insisted. "we never
really scored until late. Their de-
fense was rough. “

Rough or not. Pitt's fullbacks.
Tony Esposito and Phil Sgrignoli.
mowed through the Kent defense
for 78 and 71 yards rushing. re-
spectively. giving the Panthers‘
top three runners 286 yardson
the ground. Ordinarily—against
any defense—Esposito and Sgrig-
noli would receive more praise
for their advances. But with 190
yards to his credit. it was only fit-
ting that Saturday's encounter be
called Denny Ferris" game.

Booters Down C-MU,
But Bemis Unsatisﬁed

 

 

by MIKE MILLER

The soccer team squeezed past
Carnegie-Mellon University, 2-1.
Saturday. breaking C-MU’s two
game undefeated streak. The
booters are the first team to score
against the Tartans this season.

Denny Kohlmeyer put Pitt

ahead with a goal at 11:12 in the

first quarter. The score stood at
1-0 until the fourth quarter when
Tony Nicholakopoulous drove a
shot into the goal cage.

C-MU received their goal when
Nazir Sandurji scored on an as-
sist from Mike Sugerman.

Though the defense allowed only
three shots on the goal, coach Leo
Bemis felt some dissatisfaction.

"The defense was good from the
standpoint of allowing only three
shots on goal. but withthree shots
they could have scored three
goals. They got on us pretty dan-
gerously at times and our mis-
plays set them up."

Bemis considered the offense
to have played below its potential.

‘-‘We should have scored more

' on them,” he said.

 

Bemis blamed the small mar-
gin of victory and some mistakes
on over confidence.

"l‘ve got to get it into their
heads that they’re not super hu-
man," the coach said. “They have
some right to go out and win
games but when they play some
one whom they feel it a little be-
low them in ability. they think

Bemis described the team’s
play as “a cat and mouse game”
during the first quarter. This, he
felt, gave C-MU confidence.

“If you let a team have life long
enough they’ll rise up and kill
you." he said.

Saturdays victory put the boot-

This week end the team will

Delts Edge Delta Sig 
For 2nd Consecutive

IF C Softball Crown

by RON IEVACI

It was cold and windy. a miserable day for softball, but it couldn't
have been more perfect for the brothers of Delta Tau Delta. They re-
peated as IFC softball champions by defeating Delta Sigma Phi. 5-3, at

the All-Purpose Fields Friday.

The Delts scored first in the bottom of the second. Two out singles
by Doug Kennedy. Ray Barnhart and Bob Haniegle produced a run.
‘With some solid fielding and fine pitching by both Dom Fratangelo
of Delta Sigs and Kennedy of the Delts. the game remained 1-0 until the

fifth.

In the fift the Delta Sigs scored
their three runs. Ken Carlson and
and Fratangelo singled. They both
came around when Rich Trotz,
one of the leagues leading bats-
men, dropped a hit into right that
eluded the Delt outfielder.

The Delts came back in their
half to knot the score, with Hani-
ele and Modtes connecting for
base hits. Keisers long fly ball and
Laugherty’s two out single tied
the game.

The Delts clinched the win the

following inning. Kennedy, the
games winning pitcher. punched
out a base hit and Barnhart lined
to center, with the ball rolling by
all the fielders, scoring the final
runs.

The championship match was
marked with good defensive play,
considering the weather condi-
tions. At one point, the Delts re-
tired seven in a row. The Delta
Sigs twice had streaks of five in
a row.

This was a direct contrast to
the qualifier, played by last year‘s
finalists the Delts and Pi Kappa
Alpha. and won by the Delts, 12-7.

Pika threated,to turn it into a
runaway, tallying four runs in the
opening frame. Tom Bailey walk-
ed and scored when Greg Hy-
land‘s drive into right skipped
past the outfielder for a home run.
Ed Krywucki followed with a sin-
gle, and Jack Hannon then smash-
ed to center for another Pika

A round tripper.

But the Delts also pushed four
runs in during their half of the
first, thanks to three Pika’ errors
and clutch hits by Kennedy and
Keiser.

Pika scored single runs the
next two frames. Hyland‘s sin-
gle knocked in Paul Henderson for
one, and Don Eshenbaugh scored
on Joe Ward’s hit for the other.

The Delts also added a run in
the second when Modtes long fly
ball scored Haniele who was on
third with a hit. They then iced the
game by scoring three times in
the third and fourth.

With two out in the third, Novak
walloped a homer into left field,
McGlone singled and Delt pitcher
Kennedy hit another homer.

Tack’ Takes Lead In
Independent Softball P

by VINCE Di NARDO

Whether the Pack is Back or not
in Green Bay doesn't matter to
Pitts "Pack." Pitts "Pack" is
here to stay. The “Pack" leads
the Independent Intramural soft-
ball division as they rolled to their
fourth consecutive win Thursday
and are now the only undefeated
team in their division.

The Good Guys lost their first
of two on Thursday to the Pack.
Dennis Romanik. the Pack pitch-
er. once again starred for the
Pack. both on the mound and at
bat. His two hits drove in two
runs.

Shabby fielding by the Good
Guys also contributed to the vic-
tory. Bill Donavan. who last week
led the Good Guys to victory over
the Commuters kept the Good
Guys close. but the outcome of the
game was never in doubt.

The Pack played so good that
they were noticed by the intra-
mural director in charge of su-
pervising the game. “They are
really good,” he said.

The Pack will be challenged.
however. 1 Last years Independent
champs. the Table. are right be-
hind them with three wins.

Phys. Ed. Club Captures Two,

"Good Guys”, Commuters Topple

Contrary to the ever-popular movie script on the late show. the
good guy does not always come out on top. At least this was the case in
Thursday intramural softball action as the Physical Education Club

squeaked by the Good Guys. 5-3.

Leading the way to this “cinema upset" was Wayne Parzicwho

pitched masterfully. as well as
chipping in with some clutch hit-
ting.

It was the second victory of the
day for Parzic. having already
thrown a two hit. 5-1. win over the
Commuters in the first game of
the independent league double-
header.

Phys Ed didn’t waste any time
gloating over the victory. They
led off the nightcap with a five run
first inning. Sparking the outburst

REGENT

was the hitting of Parzic, Bob
Manfredo, and Gene Picciafoco.

The Good Guys peeked away at
the lead with single tallies in the
second. fifth and sixth. Spear-
heading the comeback attempt
was leftfielder Milan Blasco.
while third baseman Jim Barber
held Phys Ed in check with sever-
al fine defensive plays.

Phys Ed. however. managed to
hang on. capturing their theird
conquest against two defeats.

Riflers Disappointing
In F all’s First Match

Despite the fact that they came in last in a three way exhibition
match with Indiana and West Virginia. the Pitt rifle team is looking*for-
ward to the season opener on Oct. 16 against Washington and Jefferson.

Friday at Indiana the Pitt shooters scored a 1229 which was third
best. West Virginia compiled an amazing 1344 while Indiana came in

second with a healthy 1314.

Indiana's Bob Doverspike was high man for individual scores as he

shot a 270. Bill Crooks. a se_n-
ior. was high man on the Pitt
team with a 261.

Indiana and Pitt. tied for the
Western Pennsylvania Intercol-
legiate Rifle Conference Cham-
pionship last year. This year In-
diana returns with all but two
members from last year’s team
including some outstanding frosh.
Pitt lost seven lettermen but has
about 15 newcomers, who with ex-
perience and seasoning could keep
Pitt up with Indiana, Duquesne,
and C-MU, the top teams in the
league.

"One of the reasons we didn‘t
do so well Friday was the lack of
practice." noted junior Bruce
Barrett. The team has only been
together for two weeks and with
most of the team made up of in-
experienced newcomers this def-
initely hurt the team Friday.

Only two of the five newcomers

who made the trip to Indiana have
had any experience. -Allen Klug

shot last year for Fox Chapel‘

while Glenn Shaw. a junior. shot
at Cornell his freshman year.

If Coach Bill Fauzey can train

his “rookies" adequately then the ~

Pitt rifle team could retain their

Western Pennsylvania Rifle Con-A’ 

ference Co-Championship.
