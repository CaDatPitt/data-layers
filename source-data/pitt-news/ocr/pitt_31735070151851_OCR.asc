Grad student to lecture on global warming’s threat to Paciﬁc nation

Parthena Moisiadis
Staﬁ” I/Vriter
Nobody needs to tell Kateta Tagliavento
about climate change.

After she came to the United States in
2000 from Kiribati, a small country in the
Paciﬁc Ocean, she didn’t return for about
eight years. ‘ I '

When she ﬁnally went back for a visit,
she could tell the land had changed because
of rising ocean levels. K

“I used to see the beach when I was little, 1

but some of the land eroded,” said Tagliaven-

to, who now lives in Seattle. “There’s water in W

the houses. It’s horrible and scary.”

The effects of climate change on Kiribati
and its people will be the subject of a talk at
noon in room 617 of the William Pitt Union
on Monday by Michael Roman, a doctoral
candidate studying anthropology at Pitt.
During the lecture, which is hosted by the
anthropology department, Roman will pres-
ent his research on climate change, which he
collected in Kiribati in 2010.

.Roman ﬁrst visited Kiribati in 2000 af-
ter being placed there by the Peace Corps.
In 2004, Roman returned to the country in
order to study the threat of HIV and AIDS
there. The following year, he presented his
ﬁndings to the Kiribati government.

Kiribati, a country of about 100,000
citizens, sits midway between Australia and
Hawaii in the Paciﬁc Ocean. Although the
country’s land totals only about three times
the area of the city of Pittsburgh, its islands
span a distance roughly equal to the length
of the United States.

Kiribati’s land sits primarily atop coral
atolls, or ring-shaped coral reefs. These atolls

serve as a natural ﬁltration sys_tem_that makes
the water drinkable.

Roman said that many people are forced"

to migrate from Kiribati as rising sea levels
not only make much of the land uninhabit-
able, but also make salt water undrinkable.
“You go to the water fountain and press
a button [in the United States]. In Kiribati,
we dig down into the ground for water,” Ro-
man said. '

I _ Roman said_thatwhenticlesa're especially-_
high, the reefs‘ ’_are_ u;r:iable:tiog ﬁlter the ‘sea—‘ 1

water. As a result, the fresh water source is
destroyed, vegetation decays and potable
water is more scarce. _

Aarrin Baaro, a citizen of Kiribati who
migrated to the United States last month,
witnessed the environmental devastation of
the island ﬁrsthand. Baaro now lives in New
York and works as an assistant to her mother,
Makurita Baaro, Kiribati’s permanent repre-
sentative to the United Nations.

“It happens right before your eyes,” Aar-
rin Baaro said of the tides. “You don’t need to
wait for it, you just experience it.”

Baarosaid that one of the worst tides
she experienced devastated both the land
by ﬂooding homes and the drinking sources

. by ﬂooding the ﬁltration system. .
She said she hopes to convey the reality

of climate change to more people.

“It was just horrible. We had waterﬂowing
in from both sides and trees falling down. The
[roads] were destroyed. The people living on

_ the beaches were really affected,” she said. .
As a result of ﬂooding coastlines, inland, _

villages that were not as severely affected are‘
becoming densely populated.
Migrating to villages is often the only op-

tion for citizens of Kiribati, due to immmigra—
tion restrictions in other countries.

New‘ Zealand, the primary destination
for those who leave Kiribati, only accepts
75  per year as part of its Paciﬁc
Access Category quota system.

Roman said that this system functions _

as a lottery, with applicants being randomly
selected each year.
~A“The stipulation [to enter the lottery] is

that you have to have a joboffer to go,” Ro-
Roman began preliminary ﬁeld work on

climate change in Kiribati in 2008. In 2010,
he traveledgto New Zealand as a Fulbright
Scholar in order to conduct ﬁeld research
on Kiribati  . A A

Those who immigrate‘ to New Zealand

through system often work in low-paying ‘

jobs. H A T .
“They left their country to become sec-
ond-class citizens,” Roman said.

The second most common destination for

. Kiribati citizens displaced by risingsealevels

is the United States. These immigrants often

marry  Peace Corps volunteers or

military personnel.
Aarrin  said that education is be-
coming more important for youth in

' Kiribati be  use they canmigrate to further

their education as adults, instead of leaving
as refugees. ‘ A

Baaro said that part of her work with the
U.N. is to help those displaced.

“One of our major goals is to help people
move with dignity,” she said.

i ' ’.R‘oman said that there are pronounced

differences between migrant life in New

Zealand and in the United States. While im-, 3

migrants to the United States often integrate
themselves into American life as a result of
marrying into the culture, immigrants to New
Zealand mostly travel with family and fo
Kiribati communities there. '
Roman said he does not think migration

‘ will interfere with the continuation of the

Kiribati language and its culture.
Roman said that even in the United States,
where Kiribati migrants are dispersed across,

A country, the culture is retained through an

 _ind‘ependenc.e celebration onjuly 12.
S’ g lApartfr_on1 “celebrating its independence

day, Roman said that the Kiribati community

inthe United States remains connected on-
line. through social media.

“We all remain connected in a virtual so-
cietygeven if our land is lost,” Roman said,
referfingto Ahimselfas well as those who come

from Kiribati because of the strong ties he
formed with those from the country.

Roman met Tagliavento, one of his closest
friends, through social media.

Tagliavento arrived in the United States
to ﬁirther her education and remained after

, marrying her husband, an American, soon

after. _ .

Tagliavento said that she recently spoke to
her father, who remains in Kiribati, ab out the
issue of global warming. Her father denied
that he could see any changes in the land as
a result of climate change.

_Tagliavento said her father and many _

others who still live in Kiribati do not want
to admit that their home is becoming unin-
habitable. ' _

“They think that it doesn’t exist. That’s
their land and they’ll stay there until they

OPINIONS

PALLIGRAPH

Troubles with sign-up are

Rohith Palli
Columnist

Recent chatter about the Affordable Care
Act indicates that many think there are two
reasons to doubt it will work: the federal ex-
change isvdysfunctional and people are being
dropped from their insurance policies.

Let me deal with the more substantive
objection ﬁrst. Lots of people are being kicked
off their currenthealth insurance. According
to CBS News, more than 2 million “are unable
to renew their current policies.” Why?

The Affordable Care Act establishes mini-
mum requirements for all new health plans,
includingpreventative and emergency care.
According to insurance companies, most
people are being forced out of plans that are
deemed illegal under the new rules. Since any
plans created prior to 2010 do not necessarily
have to cover essential health beneﬁts, ac-
cording to United Healthcare, it is more likely
that these people are being forced out due to
the requirement to not have lifetime or an-
nual dollar limits than it is because their plans
don’t cover all the essential health beneﬁts.

So people are goingto get “better” health
insurance when they sign up for post—Afford-
able Care Act insurance on the exchanges.
The question is whether the new insurance
will be affordable.

Theoretically, it should be at the same
price or slightly lower for people below 400
percent of the poverty line ($40,000 or so
for a single-person household) due to gov-
ernment subsidies, but may be signiﬁcantly

 

higher for those who make more money. This
reﬂects the free—market compromise inher-
ent in the health law. Rather than having a
single-payer system or leavingthose with pre-
existing conditions or lesser ﬁnancial means
without care, the Affordable Care Act shifts
costs from these individuals to the govem-
ment and those with greater ﬁnancial means.

The federal health exchange, however,

‘is currently non-ﬁmctional, meaning that
A people can’t really ﬁnd out Where they stand

on this spectrum. Hence, one might think

that the failure of the federal health exchange '

reveals a fundamental lack of foresight in
the Affordable Care Act and by the Obama
administration, but one might also think
that this failure leaves countless peoplein the
dark. The former argument goes something

like this: The exchanges have fundamental »

flaws, sonno one can buy health insurance
on the exchanges. This part of the law —— the
exchanges — isn’t working, so why should
we believe that the rest of the law will work?

Though these failures might indicate

‘ that the government needs to work on its

process of implementing technology, the

exchange implementation has nothing to’

do with health care policy implementation.
Politicians and bureaucrats set policy while
the Medicare office technicians and a smat-
tering of technology contractors and subcon-
tractors designed the complicated handoffs
involved in the exchanges.

Saying that policy-makers are incapable
of setting health care policy because they
can’t handle a huge IT project is like saying

that a management expert can’t diagnose
problems in government management be-
cause they can’t distinguish between allergies
and the ﬂu. ‘

Some have argued that more avenues for

purchasing insurance or greater publication-

of alternatives to the website are necessary
to help people meet the deadline for the in-
dividual mandate and preserve optirnism for
new insurance plans. This deadline, however,
is four months away.

Even if getting the website up and running
takes two months, the fraction of the popu-
lace that needs to purchase insurance on the
exchange will have a full two months to do so
before being penalized. Furthermore, all in-
formation ultimately has to go into the same

online data system. Any efforts to increase"

utilization of alternative mechanisms for
signing up for insurance will divert valuable
resources and waste effort in collecting and
re-entering information into the unﬁnished

, computer system. Finally, people’s optimism

and attitude toward the law will be shaped
by the policies they are able to purchase and
the price of those policies, not the precise
date upon which they are able to access the
website. , r
Given the complexity of these problems,
the media does a huge disservice to the truth
when they sirnplistically say “the website
doesn’t work” and discuss political impli-
cations of the situation. People need to un-
derstand that this is not just a website and
the government could not have handled this
project on its own without the help of the

n’t indicative of Affordable Care Act potential

NSA— but does anyone want to the NSA bro-
kering their health insurance transactions?

Furthermore, those pundits who do
acknowledge the entire complex situation
nonetheless go on to say that we will know
this year or next how expensive plans are
and who signs up, as if this will be a deﬁnitive
judgment on Obamacare.

According to the,Atlantic, covering 97
percent of the population in Massachusetts
took six years after the implementation of
their law. Less than 40,000 people —- less
than 1 percent of the population at the time
— signed up for health insurance on the
exchange the ﬁrst year that Massachusetts
opened its exchanges for business. In com-
parison, Obama’s estimate of 7 million Ameri-
cans is more than 2 percent of the country’s
population.

This estimate is unrealistic and the idea
that the law will immediately cover every-
one and ﬁx problems in the health system is
preposterous. SolvingAmerica’s health care
problemwilltake along time, and the Afford-
able Care Act is only the ﬁrst step —- and even
that step will take years to ﬁilly take effect.

The current glitches (rising to the level
of “scandal” in some eyes), higher insurance
premiums and drops of those with the cheap-
est coverage are expected to be undetering
consequences of the Affordable Care Act. In
the end, “Obamacare,” along with Obama,
will be judged not by how quickly everyone
was insured, but by the state ofhealth care in

V the United States 20 years from now. I

New coach identifies ‘fragile? confidence in Panthers

Dave Uhrmacher
Staff Wrz'ter

For the Pitt women’s basketball team, the
beginning of a new season comes with some
good news and some bad.

The good news: The Panthers are now
members of the Atlantic Coast Conference,
effectively ending the 34—game Big East los-
ing streak that ultimately ledto the ﬁring
of former head coach Agnus Berenato and
the hiring of Suzie McConnell—Serio as her
replacement.

The bad news: The majority of the lineup
that won 17 combined games over the past
two years remains largely intact and, accord-
ing to McConnell-Serio, the conﬁdence of
the group is “very fragile.”

“Coming from the situation this team
has been in, their conﬁdence is very fragile,”
McConnell—Serio said. “There has been some
carry over of when things start to go wrong.
You see it with the attitude, the body lan-
guage, the demeanor. They are Very fragile.”

McConnell—Serio said she is looking for
her leaders onthe court to step up and right
the ship ahead of the Panthers’ ﬁrst regu-
lar season game at home on Nov. 8 against
Bucknell.

“I am looking to our leaders on the ﬂoor
to step up and communicate alittle more and
keep us together,” McConnell-Serio said. “I
see remnants of frustration when there are
those struggles, so it is just continuing to

‘L minimize the frustration level.”

Pitt was picked to ﬁnish 15th in the 15-
team ACC by the conference’s Blue Ribbon
Panel and its head coaches poll.

Redshirt senior guard Ashlee Anderson, \

the most tenured member on the Pitt roster,
said everyone is very optimistic headed into

the season and that the group has come a
longway, both as individuals and as a whole.

“I think everyone is coming into the
season a lot more conﬁdent,” Anderson
said. “Just the enthusiasm is different. We

‘had a good preseason and a good summer.
Everybody is stronger and has developed
their game.”

Junior guard Brianna Kiesel, the only retum—
ing player to start in all 30 games last season,
echoed Anderson and said the new coaching
staff has instilled a sense of optimism that
this team lacked in years past.

“I deﬁnitely thinkwe are a lot more con--

ﬁdent,” Kiesel said. “A new coaching staff,
a brand—new conference, nothing but op-
timism and we are excited going into the
new season.” _
The Panthers know only so much conﬁ-
dence can be built up in practice and training
situations and are eager to see if the work
they have been putting in since May will pay
off in game situations. I i
“We felt like that was our objective, to
build their conﬁdence as individuals, so our

Pitt men’s offense to pick up pace in up—tempo conference

Ryan Bertonaschi
Stajf U/rizfer

The Pitt men’s basketball program expe-
rienced more negative coverage follow~
ing last year’s ﬁrst—round eliminations
in the Big East and NCAA tournaments

than it has sincejamie Dixon was hired

as head coach in 2003.

Seven of Dixon’s 12 active scholar-
ship players from the fall of2012 either
had already transferred or would soon

graduate and leave the program. On top
of that, there were reports that Dixon
himself could be leaving Pitt.”

Since then, Dixon, for the most part,
has rebuilt his program“. After sign-
ing a 10-year contract extension, he
added six new bodies to the roster and
he re—hired former Pitt assistant Barry
Rohrssen to tackle recruiting and player
development. ‘

Nevertheless, it was an imperfect
offseason, and Dixon knows it. His main

challenge now is that thereis only one
natural center on the roster, Joseph
Uchebo, who is out indeﬁnitely with a
knee injury.

So how does the team overcome such
a problem? According to Dixon, Pitt’s
fate lies in the hands of the “T—word.”

“I think we’re going to get m.ore tran-
sition,” Dixon said.

Typically, Dixon’s offensive coaching
style depends on controlling the pace
of every possession. In his flex—based

motions, the point guard traditionally
walks_the ba_ll up the floor, directing his
forwards to set down screens that free
his teammates, spreading the floor. He
will then reverse the ball to those freed,
who look to score. '
Ifthose options fail, he will look for
a ball screen, which frees him, and from
there, hejudges the defense’s reaction
before penetrating to the lane. .

focus was doing a lot of individual work in
the summer,” McConnell-Serio said. “As we
progressed, we started doing team practices
where we would do more and more team-
oriented work just so we could build that
chemistry.”

Learning to trust each other and execut-
ing onboth ends in the new up—tempo style
implemented by McConnell—S_erio and her
staff will be key for a Pittteam that ran a very
traditional, half-court game under Berenato.

, - “Just continuing to build that conﬁdence,

that they can rebound from that or just let-
ting a play go, move on and I think that is
what we are trying to do every day in prac-
tice,” McConnell-Serio said. “Just developing
that chemistry on the ﬂoor and knowing
where everybody is and being able to play
together.” . V 0

McConnell-Serio said she will continue to
put her players in situations where they can
be successful and build that conﬁdence, but
success won’t necessarily come right away.

“I think we are awork in progress,” Mc-
Connell-Serio said. “[We’re] playing with,a
lot more conﬁdence and we have seen a lot
of growth, but we know we still have a long
way to go.” I

'lI:l2OM/ll€l§ITION

Rarely do Dixon’s teams have the ath-
leticism to get defensive rebounds and
try to beat opposing teams down the
floor atilonce. Because he has quicker
men this year,-Dixon’s half-court offense
could end up taking a back seat to the
transition game. _

“When the opportunity is there to
push,we’re definitely going to push,”
sophomore point guardand returning
starterjames Robinson said.

Robinson ﬁnished last season with
a 2.9 .assist—to—turnover ratio, tied for
18th in the NCAA. If the team is poised
to run more, Robinson must match or
exceed that stat, as he will be doing
much of the‘ work in the transition
game.

It will be a challenge for him, too,
because running in transition might
make him feel pressured to collect more
assists.

“We may try to force the issue a
couple of times, but if the clock gets
low, then we’ll definitely get into our
half-court sets,” Robinson said. “For the
most part, we want to get out and run.”

Robinson has the starting point
guard role locked up, but he will be
relieved at times by freshman Josh
Newkirk,.a shifty, 6—foot-2, 175—pound
point guard from Raleigh, N.C., who
sees the team’s desire to speed up the
tempo as an advantage of his.

“Me, being point guard, I like to run,
stay out in transition — that’s how I
play the best,” said Newkirk, who Rob-

inson pegged as the team’s most electri-
fying dunker and someone who’s done
“special things” in the transition game
since arriving. A  § 

_“Being in transition is  ﬁts us
best, so I think this will be the year to
do that,” Newkirk said. “We";have a lot
of athletic guards. I think weahave the
tools to run this year.” 

Newkirk’s speed, according to fifth-
year guard/forward Lamar  tterson‘,
islone thing Pitt has not hadzin recent
years.

“Josh is super—quick. He’s.—like light-
ning out there,” Patterson sa: I is “'That’s
something I haven’t seen wh le at Pitt
from that position.” _ j .

Patterson maybe new to  ” peed of
N ewkirk, but he certainly is not new to
the concept of running in transition. He
and fellow teammatestold reporters in
previous off-seasons that they planned
to run then, as well.

Looking back, though, those seasons
are highlighted by Pitt getting the ball
and going in its nonconference sched-
ules. The transition game then ﬂailed
away once the team got into Big East
action, with the Panthers controlling
the paces of its remaining games via a
disciplined half-court offense.

This season, though, Dixon and his
players are sure things will change.
They gave a universal answer to how
the team would stick to its preseason
plans regarding the transition offense:
6—foot—9, 230—pound Talib Zanna.

“We have a lot of great athletes on the
team, a lot of guys who are interchange-

Zanna, Patterson must step up tolead Panthers

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt enters the 2013-2014 season without
three of its top ﬁve scorers and rebound-
ers from a season ago. In total, for a team
that averaged 69 points and 35 rebounds
per game last year, the losses of Travon
Woodall, Steven Adams,].J. Moore, Dante
Taylor and Trey Zeigler account for roughly
half of Pitt’s production in each category.

So who replaces that production? For
Pitt to attain as much success as it did a
year ago, veteran leadership and new faces
must elevate their games.

Pitt carries just two seniors into this
season: small forward Lamar Patterson and
center Talib Zanna. Patterson was the only
player besides Woodall to average double-
digit point totals last season at 10 per game,
while Zanna averaged 9.6 points and 6.1
rebounds per game. e

So far, Zanna sees working overtime
with younger players as one of his duties
as a leader.

“Me and Lamar [Patterson] came in at
the same time,” Zanna said. “I’m the only
veteran in the frontcourt, so we’re doing
some extra stuff every time after practice.”

Zanna, himself, needs to lead with his
play. Zanna posted big numbers in non-
conference play last season, but essentially
disappeared during Big East games.

Out of necessity, Head coachjamie Dix-
on moved Zanna to the center position,
where he will open the season as a starter.

“I like playing the center. It probably can
create a mismatch sometimes,” Zanna said.
“Whatever the coach wants me to play, I’m
ready to play.” 

Since Zanna moved to the ﬁve, the power
forward spot cleared open and was ﬁlled by

freshman Mike Young. Dixon started two .

freshmen last season in James Robinson
and Adams and now needs to immediately
play the prize of his 2013 recruiting class.
In practices and exhibitions so far,
Young has already impressed Zanna.
“Mike is really skilled and big, strong

inside,” Zanna said. “He’s a good rebounder,

can finish strong.”

Young says he’s been learning from
Zanna since his arrival at Pitt.

“Since my ﬁrst day here, every day I
learn from him,” Young said. “Just battling
with him gets me better, he’s a great guy on
and off the court. I look up to him as a role
model and as a leader on this team.” ’

Next to Young, Jamel Artis and Josh
Newkirk are other freshmen whose services
will be required early and often. Artis can
play both forward positions and brings the
versatility Pitt needs to adjust to ACC play.

Artis has already lost more than 15 ‘

pounds, which has helped improve the
different aspects hebrings to the court.

“When you’re quicker and you’ve lost
weight, you jump higher, move faster,” Artis
said. “It’s a lot of help.”

" At Pitt’s Media Day in late September,
Dixon went as far as to compare Artis” mul-
tiple assets to those of Sam Young and Nasir
Robinson.

‘ “I thinklhe’s worked hard, I think he’s
worked harder than he’s ever done,” Dixon

said. “Really.skilled, gives us that kind of

, undersized four that we’ve had success with.

He can play the three, too.”

In the backcourt, Newkirk slots right in
to back up Robinson. Dixon said Newkirk
may be the fastest player Pitt’s ever had,
while Robinson has focused on serving a
role for Newkirk that is similar to what
Woodall provided him last year.

“With Tray [Woodall], he was a senior
last year and he kind of showedpme the
ropes,” Robinson said. “I guess ndw, with
me being older than josh, it’s kind of my
role to try to teach him how Tray taught me
last year. As a unit, we’re going to be pretty
good together.”

While Pitt is yet to play a regular sea-
son game, Robinson’s been impressed with
what Young, Artis and Newkirk have al-
ready broughtto the table.

_ “Each of them is going to contribute big
time,” Robinson said. “It’s hard to say one
is going to stand out more than the others
because three of them are going to be pretty
good for us.” I

Men's Schedule Preview:
Visits from Duke and
Syracuse highlight Pitt’s

* home matchups

Mark Powell
Stayff W ritér

As Pitt transitions into one of the best
basketball conferences in the country, l
the Panthers face perennial powerhous-
es on their path to a second—straight
NCAA tournament berth. '
Notnconference play .
The Panthers were criticizedlast year
for their weak nonconference schedule,
and it may have contributed to their low

seeding in the NCAA Tournament. The

slate of teams does not look any more
difficult this year. . ' .

Pitt does not face a real test until late
November, when the Panthers travel to
Brooklyn for the Progressive Legends
Classic to face Texas Tech University and ‘
either Stanford University or University
of Houston. None of the teams made it
to the NCAA Tournament last year.

Stanford played in the National Invi-
tation Tournament, where the Cardinal
lost in the second round.

The Panthers come back from the
Legends Classic for a pair of regional
rivalry games that are more fun for the
fans than they are a challenge to the
players. V '

Pitt plays Duquesne in the City Game
and Penn State in the Big Ten-ACC Chal-
lenge in the same week. The games
should be heated, but a loss to either
would be a disappointing setback in
the late stages of nonconference play.

Pitt will face its first tournament-
caliber team on Dec. 17, when the Pan-
thers face the Cincinnati Bearcats in
New York for the Jimmy V Classic at
Madison Square Garden. .

Led by head coach Mick Cronin, the
Bearcats have made the NCAA Tourna-
ment three straight years, and there is
no reason to believe theyewon’t be in
that position this season. This game is

a vital test for the Panthers as they head A
' -into ACC play.

Conference play .

Pitt begins conference play with two
gamesin three days against comparable
foes North Carolina State and Maryland
onJan. 4 and Jan. 6, respectively. Both
teams are mid-level ACC opponents and
could be rude awakenings for a Panthers
team that hasn’t faced much legitimate
competition.

The Panthers’ toughest road test of

the season will be playing at Syracuse ~

on Jan. 18. The Orange, led by return-

ing forward and ACC Preseason Player l

of the Year Cu]. Fair, are ranked No. 8
in the preseason coaches’ poll and are

. expected to be in the top tier of the ACC

standings.

The Carrier Dome is one of the loud-
est and largest environments in col-
lege basketball. Games like these will
determine Pitt’s fate "in its first season
in the ACC.

Pitt’s biggest home game of the 2013-
2014 season is undoubtedly the matchup
against Duke on Jan. 27. The game is
expected to have a similar atmosphere
to last year’s upset home victory over
Syracuse.

The Blue Devils come into the season
ranked No. 4, boosted by the fact that
head coach Mike Krzyzewski landed one
of thetop recruiting classes in the coun-
try, led by freshman sensation Jabari
Parker from Chicago.

The Panthers have a brutal two—game
stretch in mid—February that could likely

- determine the success of their season.

Pitt will play Syracuse at home on
Feb. 12 and then travel to North Caro-
lina three days later. The Tar Heels,- led
by head coach Roy Williams, enter the

, season ranked No. 11 and are expected
to compete for the ACC regular season .

Women’s Schedule Preview: Pitt faces tough ACC schedule

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports Editor

The ﬁnal seasons in the Big East were un-
forgettable for Pitt women’s basketball,
but for all the wrong reasons.

The Panthers ended their Big East ten-
ure with two consecutive 0-16 conference

records, so it can’t get much worse for Pitt '

in the Atlantic Coast Conference, right?
According to preseason polls from
both the Blue Ribbon Panel and confer-

“ ence coaches, the Panthers willwind up

in the cellar yet again as the bottom feed-

ers of the 15—team ACC. The Big East was

tough, but the ACC is tougher: the Pan-

Pitt begins its season at home against
Bucknell in an 11 a.m. nonconference
contest Friday, Nov. 8, and faces 13 oth-

Among the notable nonconference
matchups, the Panthers are scheduled
for an intra—city affair on Dec. 29 with
Duquesne. Pitt women’s basketball head

Washington, from Dec. 19 to Dec. 21.
After the Duquesne matchup and the

turn of the calendar year, Pitt enters a .

grueling ACC schedule that begins with
a home game against Florida State on
Jan. 2 at 7 p.m. -

The Seminoles are projected to ﬁn-
ish ﬁfth or sixth in the conference, de-
pending on which preseason poll you’re
reading.

Pitt will host Notre Dame at the Pe-
tersen Events Center on Jan. 16 — the
same scenario that resulted in a 73-47
win for the Irish on Jan. 23 of last year.
Notre Dame highlights the slate of eight
ACC teams that come to Oakland this
season, including _Syracuse,-Georgia Tech

and North Carolina State.

On the road, the Panthers face three
teams listed in USA Today’s top—25 preseason
poll: No. 2 Duke onjan. 26, No. 6 Maryland
on Feb. 6 and No. 11 North Carolina on Feb.
13. Pitt also gets Syracuse, pegged to ﬁnish
seventh in ACC preseason polls, on the -road
on Feb. 23.

The ACC Tournament, held in Greens-
boro, N.C., begins March 5. The tournament’s
championship is scheduled for March 9.

‘ Although the Panthers have escaped their
Big East woes of the past, they’re nowhere
close to being in the clear. If the preseason
polls are any indication, they are about to
write the first chapter of a similar story 
the ACC. I

Freshman Josh Newkir
  brings speed to

 

~ Pitt Men’ bacu

 

Men’s basketball Coach Jamie Dixon called freshman Josh Newkirk one of the fast-

est players to play for the Panthers. Sheldon Satenstein |AssistantVisua| Editor

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staﬂ Wrz'ter

In the past, Big East teams with swift-
moving point guards gave Pitt’s defense
fits: Dominicjames of Marquette, Scottie
Reynolds of Villanova and Edgar Sosa of
Louisville, just to name a few, frustrated

the Panthers annually.

For the ﬁrst time in the Jamie Dixon
era, Pitt could possibly be nourishing
that type of player in freshman Josh

Newkirk.

Head Coach Jamie Dixon certainly

Newkirk @ 15

November 1 , 2013 I The Pitt News | vvvv\_/v.pitinevvs.com

NEWKIRK

sees things that way.

“Josh brings a real extra—higher gear
to us offensively that we’ve never had.
I think he’s the quickest guy we’ve ever
had,” Dixon said. “It doesn’t mean he’s
going to be the best guy we’ve ever had,
but it’s a good thing to start with.”

Starting point guard James Robin—'

son will likely be relieved by Newkirk
at times this season. Newkirk said the
two have been going head—to—head at the
point guard position during practices.
Last year, Pitt’s two point guards -
Robinson and Tray Woodall —— worked
in and out of roles. Robinson handled

the ball primarily, while different plays

were run for Woodall, who remained
off the ball.

   

The tandem of Robinson and Newkirk
could, in time, work out much like that of
Robinson and Woodall — Newkirk said
he and Robinson “switch it up” during
practices, meaning one typically feeds
the other the ball. v

Since arriving on campus in June,
Pitt’s coaching staff has guided5I\Iewkirk
through aplan to gain 15 pounds. Stand-
ing at 6—foot—1, Newkirk chiseled his way
to 185 pounds at the start of fall.

“[I’m] just ‘eating the right. things, ’

staying in the weight room, lifting, and
just getting my body right,” Newkirk
said. '

Newkirk, who grew up near Raleigh,
N.C., chose Pitt over programs includ-
ing Missouri,‘Oklahoma State, North

S Carolina State and Indiana. While _in high

school, Newkirk played for  same
Amateur Athletic Union pro gr if A
rent NBA star Johnwall.

Much like Wall, Newkirk prides his
offensive game around beating his de-
fender vertically to the rim.

“My strength is speed and ‘quickness.
I enjoy doing that,” Newkirk said. “That’s
how I play the best.”

Robinson agreed.

“Josh, from day one he’s done some
pretty special things in transition. And
after a workout he might just pick up a
ball and windmill—dunk it,” Robinson
said. _

Newkirk still has aspects that could
use improvement. Above all, he said, is
his jump shot and help—side defense.

“[I need to] just be more consistent
on my outside jump shot, because in
high school I could go by anybody. Now
everybody is just as_quick and just as
fast, so to develop an outside jumper, I
need that,” Newkirk said.

Dixon said last month that Robinson

    
  

started at point guard at the start of last
season because of his exceptional perim-
eter defense. Dixon could award Newkirk
with more minutes this season if he is
able to deny opponents open lanes.

“I’m just learning Coach Dixon’s new
principles. I got to stay and help, just
different little things on the defensive
end,” he added.

Since Newkirk verbally committed
to Pitt in September of 2012, seven of
Pitt’s players have either graduated or
transferred. He said this didn’t change
his outlook for Pitt, nor was he jumping

' for joy when he heard the news that one

of his position competitors had left the
program.

“I’m just happy to be with the people
who want to be here,” Newkirk said.

to win. I can’t wait to step on the ﬂoor

able at times,” Robinson said. “Look at
our big man,‘ Talib Zanna, who is one of,
if not the fastest player on the team.”

Dixon concurred. "

“It oftentimes comes down to how
fast your bigs can run,” Dixon said.
“Talib is as fast as any big guy that we
play against, so I think that’s going to
lead to a lot more transition, as well. I

 

We ate,

think that’s going to be key.”

In recent years, Dixon and his play-
ers have all said they intended to run
more in transition offense. His teams
would push the ball during the non-
conference schedule, but once Big East
games rolled around, they began favor-
ing half-court sets and a more relaxed
pace.

Robinson knows his team’s persis-
tence to push the ball last year died as
the season went on.

“I deﬁnitely hope we continue our

pace of the game,” Robinson said. “It
just so happened that last year at some
points in the game, we had to slow the
pace down, as opposed to our noncon-
ference last year, when we could get out
and run a littlebit more. This year, we’re
’ going to do whatever it takes.”

The foundation to running teams
out of the gym lies within defensive
rebounding. Last season, Pitt racked
up 35.3~combined rebounds per game,

' tied for 138th in the NCAA.
To have hopes of a quick bucket, Pitt

must put itself back in the upper ech-
elon of rebounding teams.

. “Our first goal as a team and my first
goal as a guard is to make sure we come
up with a rebound,” Robinson said. “In
a couple games last year and especially
those we lost, we lost the rebounding
battle.”

Some of Dixon’s players who trans-
ferred lastyear complained of Dixon’s
offense, claiming‘ it was too systematic.
The transition game could provide the
creativity those players yearned for.

Robinson said that the only thing
Dixon will ‘direct is positioning after

a shot goesvup when Pitt is on de-

fense. Once the ball is in Robinson or
Newkirk’s hands, they are freelancing.
“From there, we just prettymuch
react to what everybody -else is‘ doing,
and because we’re interchangeable, we
will be su_ccessful doing that — just
making sure those spots are filledand
going from there,” Robinson said. ﬂ

Freshman trio” leads incoming players for men’s team

Jeremy Tepper
-Stcyff Writer

Jamel Artis

At 6—foot-7, 230 pounds, Artis will likely
log heavy minutes for the Panthers as their
backup power forward.

Although he’s from Baltimore, Artis
played one season and graduated from
Vermont Academy in Saxtons River, Vt.,
before proceeding to play a post-graduate
season at Notre Dame Prepin Fitchburg,
Mass. _

While there, Artis garnered All-New
England Athletic Prep School Athletic
Council honors and second—class 2A All-
State honors after averaging 18 points,
seven rebounds and four assists per game
in the 2012-2013 season.

Artis brings a unique skill set to the
power forward position, with the ability
to pass like a point guard and dribble like a
small forward. Although his jump shot was
inconsistent in prep ball, Artis has cleaned

up his mechanics and now shows the abil-
ity to knock down mid-range jumpers.

In addition to skill, Artis shows tough-
ness when ﬁghting for every rebound and
bucket against taller competition. With a
non—stop motor, strongly built body, plen-
ty of a skill and a tough-as-nails style of
play, Artis should be able to compete right
away against bigger and more experienced
competition.

Josh Newkirk

The 6—foot—1, 185-pound Newkirk will
provide a stark contrast to starting point
guardjames Robinson’s style of play. While
Robinson wants to be a steadier, more ce-
rebral type of point guard, Newkirk wants
to play fast.

With a deadly quick ﬁrst step and ex-
plosive leaping ability, Newkirk is effective
playing at this speed. Newkirk gets into
the lane often using a quick ﬁrst step and
an excellent crossover, where he’s a crafty

' ﬁnisher and quality passer.

Newkirk also competes defensively,

actively pressuring the ball to force a
turnover and start a fast break. Although
his jump shot is still developing, Newkirk
also shows the ability to knock down open
shots both inside and outside the 3-point
line.

Newkirk graduated from Word of God
Christian Academy in Raleigh, N.C., a bas-
ketball factory that has produced NBA
players such as the Washington Wizards’
star point guard,John Wall. With Newkirk
leading the way, Word of God won the state
title during his senior year.

Derrick Randall -

After spending two seasons at Rutgers,
Randall transferred to Pitt. As a true junior,
Randall will have two years of eligibility
for the -Panthers. The 6-foot-9, 240-pound
forward is from Brooklyn, N.Y., and is a
2011 graduate of South Kent Prep in Con-
necticut.

As a sophomore at Rutgers, Randall
averaged 2.1 points and 1.5 rebounds in
8.2 minutes per game. Randall will provide
brute strength to the frontcourt, where he
will mainly serve as Talib Zanna’s backup
at center.

Randall is a strong defender and re-
bounder who uses his strength to his ben-
eﬁt. Although his offensive game is still
developing, Randall uses his size to carve

Women’s team relies on returning starters to lead Pitt into ACC

Dave Uhrmacher
Szfaﬁ’ I/Vriter

The Pitt women’s basketball team is
going to have to adjust to a number of
changes this season.

First, the team will need to adjust
to new head coach Suzie McConnell-
Serio and the implementation of an
up-tempo, transition-style system.
Next, they’ll have to adapt to the fresh
faces of Atlantic Coast Conference op-
ponents. And ﬁnally, the Panthers face
rule changes in women’s basketball
that will give offensive players more
freedom of movement, with hopes the
changes will lead to increased scoring.

With the Panthers making all kinds
of adjustments ahead of their regular
season opener at the Petersen Events
Center against Bucknell on Nov. 8, The
Pitt News has an inside look into which
Panthers you should keep an eye on in
each position.

Center — Cora McManus (junior),

Marvadene “Bubbles” Anderson (red—
shirt freshman)

McManus returns to the lineup one
year after she made major strides on the
court, working her way into a starting
position in the frontcourt. While aver-
aging less than 15 minutes per game,
McManus ﬁnished fourth on the team
in rebounds and averaged 4.4 points
per game. The junior forward showed
the ability to score in the paint in quick
ﬂashes, but foul trouble and condition-
ing limited her ability to stay on the
court at times.

McManus will partner in the low-
post with Marvadene “Bubbles” An-
derson, a 6—foot—11_ redshirt freshman
who spent her first season on campus
grasping a better understanding of the
game and working on her conditioning.

Anderson is the biggest wild card
on the Panthers squad, because her
6—foot—11 frame causes mismatches for
almost every team on the schedule. Af-
ter redshirting last season, Bubbles is

expected to play and be counted on,
according to McConnell—Serio.

“She is going to be able to play in
short spurts and in certain situations,
maybe out-of-bounds plays and certain
matchups,” McConnell—Serio said. “You
can’t teach 6—foot—10 [sic]. She brings a
different element to our team that no
one else has, so we are going to try to
utilize it every way we can.”

Fellow forward Asia Logan said she
has seen progressive strides and a bet-
ter feel about Anderson’s game.

“Bubbles can bring a lot to the team,”
Logan said, “of course with rebounding
and blocking. All we have to do is throw

' the ball up and she will lay it in. We are

still working with her on the plays and
such, but she is doing a really goodjob
when she gets doubled and finds the
open player.” ’ '

Forward .—— Asia Logan (junior),
Chyna Golden (junior)

Both forward positions will—haVe an
interesting storyline to follow as the

«ms-r Swag $.9rE<££7" aP?7$3U7.r’¢s»H, PA

 

season goes on and the Panthers move
to a more up-tempo style of play. This
change could cause Logan, who aver~
aged 14 points and 7.2 rebounds per
game last season, to move to any ofthe
guard or forward positions, depending
on the situation. ' .

“With Asia Logan, I think she gives’

us versatility with being able to do dif-
ferent things for us at [power forward] ,”
McConnell—Serio said.

Logan said she has been working
on her low’-post game and approach
while facing the basket, and is ready
to perform in any position McConnell-
Serio puts her.

Golden (3.1 points per game, 4.8
rebounds per game) will be counted
on for minutes at both forward spots
and brings experience to a group of
relatively young frontcourt players.

ACC carries 5 ranked teams into 2013-2014 season play

Dan Sostek
Stcyff Writer

Pitt comes into the 2013-2014-season

ranked No. 6 in the ACC’s preseason 1

poll, and that’s where they start in the
f1rst—ever ACC Basketball Breakdown.

No. 4‘Duke takes the top spot as the

conference’s highest-ranked team.

1. No. 4 Duke Blue Devils

As long as head coach Mike Krzyze—
wski remains at the helm of the pro-
gram, the Blue Devils will always remain
in the top tier of the ACC. The team’s
biggest move this offseason was recruit-
ing star prospect Jabari Parker. Throw
Parker in with the likes of sophomore
guard Rasheed Sulaimon, Mississippi
State transfer forward Rodney Hood,
junior guard Quinn Cook and senior for-
wardjosh Hairston, and the Blue Devils
will once again ﬁeld a formidable squad.

- 2. No. 7 Syracuse Orange
Syracuse replaces star point guard

Michael Carter—Wi1liams with freshman
Tyler Ennis, who many believe can sur-
pass Williams’ play. The biggest boost
for the squad was forward C._]. Fair’s
decision to stay for his senior season
rather than declare for the NBA draft.
If Fair _can pick up some offensive slack
to make up for the loss‘ of 3-point spe-
cialist James Southerland, Fair will be
a contender for ACC Player of the Year,
and Syracuse will be in contention for
a conference title."

3. No. 25 Virginia Cavaliers

Perhaps one of the biggest sleepers in
the entire nation, this Virginia Cavaliers
team is a legitimate contender in the
ACC. One of the best defensive teams in
the nation just one year ago, expect them
to be even better this season. Sopho-
more guard Justin Anderson should
make a leap this season and develop
into a.dangerous ‘second option to star
guardjoe Harris on offense for the Cavs.

UNC will likely go as far as their ju-
nior forwardjames McAdoo takes them.
McAdoo has shown ﬂashes of brilliance
at times, but he must become more con-
sistent for the Tar Heels to make a run.
P.]. Hairston is an offensive asset, and
if he can improve defensively, the team
will have two potential stars in their
lineup. if

.5. No. 22 Notre Dame Fighting Irish

The Irish get the nod over the teams
below them because of the wealth of
experience on the team. Senior Jerian
Grant is one of the best point guards
in the conference. The pair of Grant
and fellow senior guard Eric Atkins give
Notre Dame one of the best backcourts
in-the conference. Tom Knight and Gar-

rick Sherman provide the Irish with two

big bodies down low.

6. Pittsburgh Panthers I

have to be the primary offensive weapon
for the Panthers, although junior guard

critical blow, leaving the Terps without

The team has lost buzzer-beater mae-

One ofthe most disappointing teams
in the nation last year, a wealth of talent
wasn’t enough to avoid a first-round exit
from the NCAA Tournament. After the
departures of three starters, the team
will rely heavily on forward T.J. Warren,
but the Wolfpack 'doesn’t seem to have

It’s been a while since the Eagles
have been a contender in the ACC, and
although they probably won’t be one
again this year, they won’t be a push-
over, either. Led by emerging star Olivier
Hanlan and junior forward Ryan Ander-
son, Boston College has an extremely
underrated offense that should be tal-
ented enough to collect a few upsets
this season. .

12. Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets

The good news for the Yellowjackets
is that the team returns four starters
this season. The bad news is that none
of them are extremely promising play-
ers. Highlighting the returning crop of

looks to improve on his freshman year, T

when he led the team in scoring.

bo also runs the ﬂoor very well. On the
offensive side of the ball, Uchebo does an

‘excellent job of creating space and ﬁn-

ishing with a soft touch. Health willing,
Uchebo has incredibly high potential.
Michael Young
’ Young is one ‘of few Pittsburgh natives

that the Panthers have had on their team
V over the last several years. Originally from

Duquesne, Pa., Young played his freshman
year of high school at Shadyside Academy

Y in Pittsburgh. .
After that, he transferred to St. Bene-

dict’s Prep in Newark, N._]., where he played
his sophomore and senior years. Between
those years, he spent his junior year at

, Hudson Catholic High School in Jersey
City, NJ. . - ~ '

Young was a pivotal player during his
senior year, when St. Benedict’s ﬁnished
as runner—up at the National High School
Invitational and won the Newjersey Prep
Championship. - .

At 6—foot—8, 245 pounds, Young pro-

1 vides ideal size as the Panthers likely start-
ing power forward. His skill‘ set is ideal too, "

as he’s a good passer, capableballhandler

'= and above—average jump—fs-hooter for the _
‘power forward spot. I‘ V
’ Young isn’t afraid to throw his weight .

around, either, as he uses his strength to
body'the opposition for rebounds and ﬁn-

A -ish inside with avariety of moves and shots

on offense. A

On the defensive sideofthepball, Young, ,

can‘ stop his opponentwith ample» length,

size, athleticism and shot-blocking ability. ,
