Medical School Charged With Discrimination

by RALPH DEAN

In an action that is among the
first of its type. Dr. Sharon John-
son. an assistant professor in
Pitts School of Medicine. has filed
suit against Chancellor Posvar
and three officials in the Medical
School regarding a decision made
to deny her tenure.

The civil suit charges that the
decision to deny tenure was made
a manner which violated the

\:.4'

l"~__-..Civil Rights.Acts of 1964 and 1866.

 
  
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
     
  
     

 
   

The 1964 act was made applicable
to educational institutions in a bill
signed by President Nixon in
March, 1972. The suit also charges
violations of the First and 14th
Amendments.

Named in the suit along with
the Chancellor are: Vice Chancel-
lor Francis Cheever; Dr. Donald
Medearis, Jr., Dean of the School
of Medicine; and Dr. Edward
Heath, chairman of the Depart-
ment
School of Medicine. '

Johnson has been teaching bio-
chemistry in the Medic-al School
 six years. A committee made
ine decision to deny her tenure

"on October 27. 1971. Johnson was

informed of the decision in Jan-
uary. 1972; she objects to\what
she believes wasian unnecessary

delay in informing her of the ten-

ure decision. She claims also that
the committee made its decision
without inquiring with her about
committee activities or publica-
tions which she hadparticipated
in and which the tenure group
would have no means of knowing
about. .
After failing to get help from
the Affirmative Action Office.

of Biochemistry J in the «

"Women's Health Service.

Johnson took her case to the Dean
of the School of Medicine. Failing
there. she contacted the Academic
Freedom and Tenure Committee.
which found "evidence of sex bias
and of harassment by the Medi-
cal School“ in the case. Johnson
went to the Chancellors Office on
July 5. 1972, and maintains that
discussion there produced no re-
sults. Johnson cites the fact -that
Pitt has never had an Academic
Due Process Hearing as evidence
that “the various grievance com-
mittees are powerless."

The lawsuit cites statistics
which show that although 30 per
cent of the Ph.D.’s granted by the
Medical School are to women,
only 2.2 per cent of the tenured
faculty members are women.

,Abor,tion . Iinic Organized

by LINDA SAVAGE

Concurring/with the recent Su-
preme Court ruling on abortions.
Inc...
an organization of doctors and in-
terestedrpeople from the Pitts-
burgh area, has made plans to
open an oufpatient abortion clin-
ic in downtown Pittsburgh.

According to Marc Hiller. a first
year medical student at Pitt and
member of Women's Health
Service. Inc.. the clinic is being
opened because the organization
believes “any woman should be
able to terminate an unwanted

- pregnancy."

On the organizing committee
for the clinic are Dr. Leonard

In addition to the lawsuit. John-

which would prevent the Universi-

Dean Medearis. one of the de-
fendants in the case. told The Pitt
News that there was no delay in
informing Johnson. since the case
was only in the process of being
reviewed during the fall of 1971.
and that the final decision was
not reached until January. 1972.
He also says that "all the facets
of the case were reviewed." and
that this included interviews with
students. and a review of the pub-

Pilf Student Profesis 

ReCem‘ lwelfare Rulings .-

by KARL BALDYS

, On Friday. Feb.  a Federal District Court unanimously ruled. in.".'f.A>
favor of Correne Stewart, a Pitt student. who was contesting the policy 1
of the State Welfare Department which denies general assistance. to‘ ‘

college students. Stewart‘s attorny, Michal Nemec, said. “The judges

‘ felt this was a clear cut infringement of the consitutional‘ right of due

process." _ J \ .

Stewart had been receiving aid. according‘ to her attorney, for
about a year when the State Welfare Department in June of 1972 ad-
justed its policy. The department decided that full time college students
do not meet the employment‘ requirements of the public assistance act.-
although students attending trade schools’ do. "

One of the employment requirements is that the welfare recipient . 
must actively seek employment. “We argued that this was a conclusive .

presumption and violated the right of due process of law under the 14th
amendment,” Nemec said. He continued, “In Corren’s case, she was

employed 15 hours a week in a work-study program and also worked ‘ iv 3

part-time as a waitress. That constitutes a work schedule of almost 30
hours per week.” ~ ‘

Nemec explained the defense of the state as one that justified the 1.‘
rights of the state to make distinctions in and interpretations of the .so- " "
cial welfare laws. He added that the court was not challenging that  _
right of the state but rather protesting that in thisspecific case the ,."

discrimination was an infringementof personal rights. ,

This new state welfare policy and theiresultant case only applies

f to money disbursed under the general assistance category. It does not
apply to the student whose family is receiving welfare as long’ as the
student is not older that 21 years of' age. The latter program is financed

by the Federal Government while the former. the general assistance ; 

money, is financed solely by the state.

Nemec saw the decision as only a partial success, however. While A i

this particular case is happily resolved, other students may find them-
selves faced with legitimating «their rights to welfare through the
courts. This could be averted if the Department of Welfare would make
their criteria more flexible. At present,’ college students are flatly
denied general assistance money. According to Nemec, “. . . the judges

are kind of holding a gun at their (the Welfare Department) heads . . .” _ ‘I ,

Viet Nam War Over,

by MONICA A. CIROCCO
' "The Arab-Israeli Conflict To-

/ day" was discussed by Dr. Rich-

ard Cottam, professor of Politi-
cal Science. at the Young Men and
Women‘s Hebrew Association on
Monday. The lecture was the third

of~a series in "Middle East Per-

spectives." sponsored by the
B‘nai B'rith Hillel—Jewish Univer-
sity Center of Pittsburgh.

Cottam highlighted some of the
Arab and Israeli attitudes that
have persisted over the years.

I stating that the Arabs view Israel

as a "settlers state," and an ex-
panion of western imperialism.
The Israelis maintain that their
settlement is "the search for a
havenf‘

Cottam outlined five major im-

ii pacts on Arab attitudes. The first

is the 1967 war, which he said
made the Arabs more aware of
the relationship between Israel

_ and the Western nations.

Next is the identity change with-

in the Arab community. Cottam
cited attitudes such as "Egypt
has sacrificed enough for Pales-
tine.“ Thirdly. he stated. "The
A;-abs. have a bargaining advan-
tage because of their oil re-
sources." and he emphasized that
because of the "energy crisis“
they now have an influence on
Western nations they never had
before.

Cottam said that the fourth fac-
tor is the most important: the
sign of Soviet conflict. China is
starting to take an interest in the
situation and. as a result. is com-
peting againstthe Soviet Union
for Arab favor.

The final factor is Israel’s per-
sistence to keep the Sinai area,
which,‘ he stated, is one point on
which Egyptian leaders will not
retreat.

He then focused on Israeli atti-
tudes. stating that they feel they
can provide their own security
and want the world to leave them
alone.

Cottam emphasized that both

ice counseling to make the proce-
dure "as easy as humanly.possi—
bler for the woman." He ‘added
that the staff that is being hired

 
  

"will, be concerned with people
and senstitive to the needs of the
women that come in.“

The abortion itself. stated Hill-

. er. is a simple procedure and will

only take 15.minutes. "but there is
no denying its emotional impact."
After the abortion the patient will
be counseled on differnt types of

ontraceptives. so that the inci-
dence of repeaters will be kept
low. said Hiller.

 Flood Victims Recieve

Middle East Gains Priority PHEAA Scholarships  

Arab and Israeli leaders have lit-
tle ability‘to maneuver because
of public sentiment within their
countries. Heconcluded by stat-

ing that now that the Vietnam war

is over. attention is being directed
to the Middle East situation: “The
Soviet Union is very interested in
a settlement.“ he said. and noted
that Nixon and the Arabs must
also now show an added interest

"in this area.

The Pennsylvania Higher Edu-
cation Assistance Agency mailed
state scholarship payments total-
ing $19.974.453 to 837 colleges in
behalf of more than 95.000 state
recipients. In the
same mailing were checks total-
ing $1.20”/.175 for 4.000 students

Remuneration Funding

‘Questioned

{Continued from Page I)

for the first time involve students
directly in the remuneration issue
which had prviously been con-
sidered only by the administra-
tion and Student Government. in
January. 1972. a disappearing
task force was set up Dr. Moye.
Dean of Student Affairs to inves-
tigate the sources of funds and

criteria for student leader re-
muneration.
The conclusion of this task

force was that funds could not be
directed through the Student Aid
‘Office in the form of scholarships
because a majority would'be re-
quired to deduct that amount from
their PHEA allotment.

A development program funded
by grants and gifts by alumni and
organizations is now -a possible
alternative but will not provide
an immediate solution.

The student referendum. held in

the commuter association
_ 

ri:BUTc

I

Noveniber. legitimized student ac-
tivities fees and cancelled the
proposal to demand a small pay-
ment from each student activity
as a third source for remunera-
tion funds.

The fourth potential solution in-
vestigated by the task force was
that a certain percentage of stu-

dents’ activities fees be allotted "

for remunerations.
The Student Government Board

tapped this last source and made

a one-time allocation of $15000 to
the Remunerations Board.

Consequently. the new Student
Government Board will have to
face the problem of remunera-
tion’and funds even if the Cheru-
bin referendum fails to gain mo-
mentum. The Board will have to
evaluate the feasibility of fund-
ing student leaders‘ remunera-
tions or devise another solution
when the budget for the fiscal
year 1973-74 isdrawn up.

 

emergency legislation passed by
the Pennsylvania General Assem-
bly. ‘
The payments are for the sec-
ond half of the academic year.
First—half payments were sent
last October. They are being made
from a $60.4 million appropria-
tion for the regular state scholar-
ship program and a special flood
allocation of $3.8 million.

This need is determined by var-
ious factors. such as family earn-
ings. asset and liabilities. the
size of the family and the number
of children enrolled in higher edu-
cation institutions. Awards never
exceed the cost oftuition and fees
at a school. Generally the state
meets only one-third of the need
of an individual student through
the state scholarship program.
The support expected from the
parents’ income is subtracted
from the students cost of educa-
tion to determine the students‘s
need. The state scholarship is
then set at one-third this need in
the family income is over $8.000
and at one-half this need if family

annual income is below $8.000zf’\‘;.
Awards never exceed the costs of 7

tuition and fees at the school. Eli-
gible students receive from $100
to $1.200 to attend in-state schools
and up to $800 for attendance at
out~of-state schools. depending
on their need. -

Students also may obtain a stu-
dent loan through the state's stu-
dent Guaranty Loan Program.
Here students borrow from pri-
vate lenders on a long-term. low
cost basis. the state guaranteeing
the loan through PHEAA.

with his personal’ concern for
my welfare.

Yet if these were the only
stupid things about the Air Gram.
it would be halfway intelligent
compared with some junk mail.
Butitisn‘t. .

Like so much other advertising
of this sort. the Air Gram resorts
to overstatement. ,

Overstatement may be an ef-
fective 'device in_ humor writing,
but it falls flat when it comes
to encouraging a thinking person
to blow money on career train-
ing.

Printed four times across the
top of this school‘s message is
the phrase "Glamorous public
contact careers". In the next
they say that commercial air
careers offer_ “excitement".

I suppose there are plenty of
suckers who fall’ for this. believ-
ing that the airline industry is
some "heavenly" employer.

This school. however. does
not train men to be daring pil-

ots nor women _to be ravishing.

stewardesses. It trains ticket
agents, reservationists. and so on.
It (brings to mind a young
Wayne Newton-like agent out at
the Greater Pittsburgh Airport.

At an ungodly hour of. the morn-
ing he was quietly selling tickets
to sleepy-ejyed travellers who had

just rolle out of bed not too
long before.
That is exciting. glamorous

public contact‘?

If this tarnishes the schools
"glamour" line a bit. think of
the job that some girls often look
upon .as being glori_ous: steward-
ess.

Liberated women may cringe
at it. but it is fact that one major

criterion for the job is a fair‘

amount of physical attributes. In
addition. stewardesses don‘t last
once they have too much “mil-
eage". and begin to show it.

When such harsh reality in-
vades the wonderful’ job of stew-
ardess. then it surely invades
positions that are held in less es-
teem.

In the case of this airline
school, -they ask on their "business
reply card, “Any physical de-
fects?” And they picture a per-
fect man-woman airline pair star-
ing into space.

The school apparently doesnt
want someone who even approach-

resulted in an unjust suspension

‘of the Judicial Board in the always A

difficult task of sifting through
the evidence and arriving at a
just decision. As a student I cer-
tainly do not feel that my stud-
ent activity fee is being misused
by funding the services provided
by the Legal Awareness Com-
mittee.

If the Legal Awareness Com-
mittee were not here to help us
in this manner. who else would
be equipped to? Certainly not
Ralph Dean whose total lack of
knowledge of the law or even
plain common sense (on which
much of our law is based) is evi-
denced by his statement that
any lawsuit aimed at a patently
illegal housing contract which
forces freshmen and certain
"aid" students to patronize Szabo
or any other food service chosen
by the University as a condition
to be being provided with Uni-
versity housing is “doomed to
failure."
that the decision to do away with
the mandatory meal policy was
due in great part to the fact that
the Housing Office was threaten-
ed with a lawsuit for violating
Federal Anti-Trust Laws. The
basis for this threatened court
action is (1) the Housing contract.
which requires a student to pur-
chase a meal ticket. is a contract
of adhesion; ‘Z’. ihe mandatory
meal ticket pO1i.r:y acts in restraint
of trade since students are effec-
tively prevented from patronizing
other restaurants of their choice
on a regular basis (unless the
student happens to be very weal-
thy): and (3) the mandatory meal
ticket policy provides Szabo with
an illegal monopoly over student
trade ‘in this area. The Housing
Office recognized that its” hous-
ing contract was illegal and could
not withstand a lawsuit. and its

latest policy pronouncement on

meal tickets is obviously an at-
tempt to placate the students
threatening to sue (none are in
next year's freshman class )'and
perhaps even to remove their
standing to bring a court action
since their rights. not being
freshmen or‘ "aid students. will

no longer be affected. But if a

men and "aid" students. You do
not have to be an expert on the
14th Amendments guarantee of
Equal Protection of the Law to
realize this. So how does Dean
get off stating ex cathedra a law-
suit is "doomed to failure?"
Dean must either be stupid. a
federal court judge. or deliberate-
ly misstating the facts in a fee-
ble attempt to turn students
against the Legal Awareness Corn-
mittee. I prefer ‘to believe that
he is somewhat ignorant of the
facts. '

Though I am not a member of

the Legal Awareness Committee-
(note the correction on page 4 '

of the 1.26/73 Pitt News) I have
had the opportunity of working
closely with the committee and
its chairman for some time now.
Over this time I have developed
a profound respect for this im-
portant arm of the Student Gov-
I also ‘know that the
Legal Awareness Committee has
gained the respect of the Campus
Police. City Police. City‘Magis-
trates and Judges of our Common
Pleas Court. Many similar groups
at schools throughout thecountry
have consulted the Legal Aware-
ness Committee for advice and
have patterned themselves after
Pitt's Committee. It -pains me to
see Jeff Pasek and the Legal
Awareness Committee subjected
to such irresponsible criticism.

Very truly yours.

Mr.

Dean replies — If you
think you can criticize my col-
-umn on factual grounds. Mr.

Byer. please do so. If you wish —

to continue in name-calling indig-
nation. you will find no further
audience here. If Legal Aware-
ness thinks it has been'unfairly
damaged by this vicious pawn

But with the bad job market.

other overdone junk—mail selling

the use of Vitamin C as an aid

against the common cold. It
stated that the ingestion of "one
or two tablets of Vitamin ‘C (500
mg.)“ would be helpful in gain-
ing resistance against the com-
mon cold. I would like to ex-
pound upon these recommenda-
tions with several comments.

Linus Pauling's study tested the

effect-s of dosage Levels from V ,

to 15 gm. per day per individuaLi
This ‘represents from 1.000 to
15.000 mg. per day (the unit of
weight in which drug companies
manufacture drugs). The ‘results
obtained showed increased resis-
tance to the cold/with an in-
crease of_the dosage. Subsequent
to this study. various _comments
from the medical profession indi-
cated that the higher dosage lev-
els maintained over an extended
period of time. may precipitate
deposits in the urinary system.
similar to "-kidney stones." How-
ever. no comments have been
raised against the lower dosage
levels proposed by Pauling.

It has been my personal ex-
perience, in talking with physi-
cians, that a normal therapeutic
dosage against the common cold
could approach 3 gm. per day
(3000 mg.), and that there is no
harm that could come to the hu-
man body at these levels. It has
also been recommended to me,
that, in the event the symptoms
of a cold begin to appear, the
dosage‘ taken by an ‘individual

may be doubled or tripled over .

the course of one or two days.

The determination of an opti-
mum dosage level can be based
on the individuals body build.
For example. a slender pers '
need only take from .5 to 1. '
gm. per day to achieve satisfac-
tory results. whereas. a heavy
person may need up to 3 gms.
perdayx

As an aside. I have personally
taken 2 gms. of ascorbic acid
per day (4 tabs. 500 mg. each)
since the onset of the “cold"
season and have not contracted
as much as a sniffle.

I hope’that these comments
clarify an important matter and
provide some useful information
to Pitt students.

Harry Blandig has been to
the house again. I think my
landlady recognizes him now;
our place is up in the attic of
an elaborate old home, with
wood panelling everywhere.
and things generally work
pretty well. Except when Har-
r_v comes to visit.

Last time he was here the
heat in the radiators dwindled
and finally vanished. It was
too late to call for help, so we
added sweater after sweater
as Harry droned on and on
with some dull story. Along to-
ward dawn. when the night
was at its coldest. he finally
got bored with boring us. and
left. Probably found it warmer
outside than in our apartment.

This time, his most recent
visit, the electricity went.
Five minutes after Harry ar-
rived, total darkness. That
was straight forward enough:
time to change a fuse. The box

,__was in the cellar, but I needed
‘ the exercise. We had plenty of

spare fuses from an experi-
ment with air-conditioning last
summer.

When I had restored service.
as ever_v good utility should.
things were not as they once
had been. The light from our
various fixtures was dim.
More than that. it semed
brownish and off-color. My
roommates complexion look-
ed as bad as Harry's.

dead. It is never sick.

It was sick.

The turntable crawled at
about 12 RPM. the FM radio
produced only groans and hiss-
es. with an occasional pop.
There was no music to drown
Harry out.

The dim kitchen light show-
ed a panorama of pans grow-
ing cold on the stove. We had
told Harry we had already eat-
en. He wasn’t hungry anyway.

Harry -got a glass of wine.
studied the rug. shook it. and
decided to save a few step .
He set his glass and the whole
gallon of Zinfandel on a table
and sat down. In my chair. He
spoke.

"You know. I think Ireall_v
got myself into a good thing
this time.“ he said.

J “What makes you think that,
Harry?”

"It‘s at school. PIRG never
really made it. you know; and
the political parties might as
well have been insisting on
celibacy for all the attention
they got. SDS is still pretty
small. and nobody seems to
care how the air smells
There's just no effective way
to stir up a mass movement
any more. at least not so far."

“I thought you had that all
figured out last Fall.“

“Whatcha mean?”

"Come on. Har. You remem-
ber."

“Oh yeah. You mean that
Ignorance Lib thing, I guess. I
still don't see how that one
could ever go wrong on me. but
it did. I learned a lot. though.
We were demanding free cas-
ette recorders for. everybody
then. I never realized most of
them were into eight-track."

“So what did you learn?”

"Well. the Revolution has
to learn from its own mis-
takes. stuff like that.

So what are you into now?"

“It’s the greatest thing
yet,” Harry said, “Except I
got thrown out of it for a while.
They call it the SPS.”

“One thing at a time. How'd
you get tossed out. and what is
this SPS?“

“Well. I asked for a mem-
bership card. you know. like
you will. and they told me I
was out.”

$6why?))

"One of their rules. I under-
stand it much better now."

"Harry. tell me just one
thing. What the hell is this
SPS."

“That’s what I wanted to
tell you until you started ask-
ing me all these stupid ques-
tions. It is the organization to
end all student organizations.
Everybody is already in it.”

"So what does it do?"

“And what does it do?”

“Nothing. It just is. Can you

"It doesn't do anything‘?'‘

“No. Right now we’re not
even noticing who the Presi-

whatever the condition of edu-
cation in this country might
be.”

"lsthatall‘?"

“Of course not. We are also

indifferent to whether there is

‘ ertainly. We plan to avoid
anything that might be history
someday, and forget whatever

“But how does it work?
How do you join a thing like

“You can’t. We're perfectly
consistent. If you write to us,
you’re automatically ineligi-
ble. In fact, if you do anything,
you’re out.”

Harry smiled in triumph. A
little wine dribbled onto his
sweatshirt. From the jug. The
last drops. Harry belched and
shimmered in the vague light.

“There‘s only one thing that
bothers me. Harry. If nobody
can join. how do you collect
dues. or donations. or

Harry dropped the jug.

Ideas & c Figures Uncrealive

' by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

. What lies beneath the some-
. what Daliesque cover of _thewin-
. ter edition of Ideas and Figures is
less than profound and reflective
of mo_re drearinessthan a funeral.
These may indeed -be blunt pro-
nouncements but onecan only be
blunt when the dignity of creative
writing is at stake as it is in_this
‘publication. ' '
We say "at stake" because of
' the = very uncreative amount of
-material which is packed into this
magazines 48 pages: poetry.
' prose. photography. and art of the
most jejune nature have been
' combined with a resultant sputter
rather than an aesthetic cres- .
cendo. ' -

Nonetheless, there can be little
doubt that Ideas and Figures has
improved with time. A glance at
past attempts makes one shudder
and frankly ask, “Why bother?”

‘ And with the recent arrival of the
newest edition, one still shudders
but one no longer asks, “Why
bother?” One asks, instead,
“What does it all mean?”

_ Finding an underlying theme to
the’ current number of Ideas and
Figures is no easy "matter. Edi-
tor Karl Baldys, in his afterword.
suggests chaos. ,With this pro!
nouncement, we would heartily
agree, provided that Baldys
means artistic chaos. There are
other themes that could easily be ‘
suggested for this publication as

. well; existentialism and eroti-
cism seem to be two acceptable
afterthoughts for the present.

ures unfortunately ‘falls where its
primary strength should lie——its
verse. If there were anything
completely devoid of creativity in
this latest edition, it is its poetry.
Practically every "poem" is writ-

-ten in the same clipped. freeverse

style. One could almost swear.
due to the absence of stylistic var-

iety. that most of the verse was

penned by the. same person.

Amazement is the only proper
reaction to the triteness of many
of the lines‘ which appear: “like
so many dew drops,” “I am dying

.to find you,” “like so many good
vby kisses.”

y Where indeed has
imagination flown? .

, Primary rules of verse are very
often ignored. Redundancy
abounds thus breaking the all im-
portant rule of consciseness. For
example. "Dragged myself out of
bed; Lit up a joint. a cigarette."
Poetic license is no justification
t'or this error. - i -

Subject matter is usually sex-
ually or morbidly inspired. The
sexual implications of a poem
such as "Ritual“ leaves this read‘-
er unmoved by its bird‘s eye view
of the bedroom rite. When many

‘of these poemsitwere conceived

for this edition. the fleshwas evi-
dently willing but thespirit was
indeed weak. . ,
This desire for sexual “sophis-
tication” overflows into the prose
story, “French. Death,” a work
which eliminated the problem of
filling two empty pages if little
else. Breaking the monotomy of
the sexual subject matter is an-
other story, ,“The Ten Dollar
Watch.” No sex here, only the

‘of "nudes" are so boorish/that; I

Lecture Series Set By

A tliree-part lecture series on
the theatre by the famed theatri-
cal artist. Dr. Maria Piscator. is
set for Sunday. Feb. 25. in the
Craft Avenue Theatre of the Pitts-
burgh Playhouse.

Besides teaching Theatre His-
tory and Directing as the Disting-
uished Visiting Professor of the
Department of Theatre Arts at
Point Park College. Dr Piscator
has earned international plaudits
as director. choreographer. in-
structor. playwright. and lecturer.

Her 7 p.m. lecture is entitled,
“The Method and the Theatre —
Stanislavski-Strasberg." Her fol-
lowing two lectures on March 18

and April 15 will cover, respect- .

fully, “The Epic Theatre—Pisca-
tor-Brecht,” and “Therapy The-
atre—Your Performance.” All
starting times are 7 p.m.

Piscator. along with her bus.-

band. Erwin Piscator, was one of
the most influential exponents of
Expressionism in German Tl1e—

ﬁatre.

Her teachings embrace the
"contact theory and practice"
professed by her husband. who
believed that the theatre is a se-
ries of "sparks" between people
and things. between people and
ideas. and between a person and
himself. Her approach to theatre
is anti—Stanislavski. objective.
and dynamic. utilizing the actor
as "thinker and dancer" rather
than a mirrored reflection of pos-
sible individuals.

In dance, Madame Piscator, af-
ter 10 years as a concert artist,
choreographed Max Reinhardt’s
production of Midsummer Night‘s
Dream, Imaginary Invalid. A Ser-
vant of Two Masters. and- other

, plays in Vienna and Salzburg fes-

tivals. She has also published sev-
eral essays in Theatre History as

"well as two novels, poetry, many

originals plays, and a book on the
Dramatic Workshop of the New
School under the guidance of her
husband from 1939 to 1952.

athlete. have laid\claim to Regis White. Calling it quits after ten
years. White will no longer be running around in the Pitt Field
House locker room, playing housemaide to the Basketball. Track. and

Wrestling teams—providing them
with a towel here and a G-string

‘Rege. as he will be remem-
bered, had been having trouble
keeping up with the young vig-
orous collegians he has so faith-
fully catered to lately.

‘_'My legs have really been

claimed in announcing his re-
tirement. "Sometimes I can hard-
ly bend them. I had to call Cas

someone else."

The departure did not come

without a last precious memory _
. for the Smiling Oakland native.

Following the Cagers lopsided
win over William and Mary last
week. the hoopsters presented
White with the game ball.

"Oh;b‘rother. that took ‘me by
surprise." White commented yes-
terday. "If I would have stayed
in that room any longer I would
have started to cry. It was really
something. That day was the
greatest of my life." '

White had gotten his start at

Pitt picking papers up at Pitt‘

‘Stadium after football games.

’ Then after a stint on the ground

crew as a reserve, Rege was
recommended by Boo Connors
and replaced Connors when the
latter moved to the stadium.

ers hold my fondest memories."
White added. "I really loved that
job.“

    Myers In Power Pinch

3 By VINCE Di NARDO
Sports Editor

G. Wilson Myers, who has ablely served
as Pitt’s head athletic trainer ‘since 1967, has
decided of his own volition not to return to
Pitt ‘for another year of service. Sometime be-
tween now and ,June, Myers will quietly
evaporate from the Oaklandscene.

But, Myers’ decision did not come as a
positive gesture of returement, not because
he is fed up with "Pitt athletics. The resigna-
tion was brought about by a . -
year long back-stabbing po1i- 
tical power struggle. which *-
along with Myers included
the head  the Pitt Depart-
ment of Sports Medicine.
Doctor James McMaster.

A little bit of background
would be beneficial in un-

MYERS

derstanding this whole mess. First of all. the
University of Pittsburgh operates its train-
ing program unlike any other school. Be-
cause Pitt has one of the nations outstand-
ing medical schools to begin with. it is only
appropriate that it should lead the charge
for medical reform in Athletics.

If a Pitt athlete needs a‘ doctor’s care
McMaster can call on any of his 35 other
doctors, who work as consultants, for service.
In the past, this had been the head trainer’s
responsibility. The real problem arose when
McMaster called Myers into his office one
day and asked him to relinquish his title.

No. Myers wasn't asked to take a pay
cut, nor was he asked to leave. Simply to
become an ordinary trainer. The thinking
was that since Pitt didntoperate on a head
trainer system there was no need for a head
trainer. * » ' -

Ordinarily. this would be
But. . . . ’- /

It was no secret that McMaster had cri-
tisized Myers for poor jobs since the begin-

Pink Panthers
Sweep Tri-Meet

Saturday the Pitt women gymnastsycame out clearly on top ill a
tri—meet situation with Indiana L'niversity and P&i\l. Ihe score was
Pitt 77.15. Indiana 55.14. and F&M 31.50.

F&M‘s team had been plagued with injuries this season and thus

problems as its best balance
beam competitor was out for Sat-
urday's meet. .

Pitt took’ 10 places. leaving the
remaining two for Indiana. F&.\l

On floor exercise Pitt’s spe-
cialist Donna DeMarino took first
place with a 7.60. Her teammate
Becky Zuccarelli came in second,
scoring 6.85. “Both the girls real-
ly performed outstanding bal-
lets,” said Coa_ch DiCicco. Indiana
took third place in this event with
a 6.80. ‘

The vaulting event was truly
the Pink Panthers‘ stronghold.
Pitt took every place with Kathy
Krynock capturing first on a fan-
tastic handspring vault. earning
her a score of 7.80. Holdah Jones.
a newcomer to Pitt‘s team this
year. took second with a’ 7.05.
Third place went to DeMarino
who scored 6.50. Close behind
was teammate Anne Monahan
who came in fourth with a‘ 6.45.

nock of Pitt captured first place,
scoring 61.55. Pitt’s Anna Krupa

Blue Line Confidence

“ llllllllllllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE

by BART MACK
The stage has been set for the long awaited re-
match between the Pitt Hockey Club and the skat-
ers from Carnegie-Mellon I.'niver,sit_\' and the Pitt
icers are ready. Just ask defenseman Duke Schaef-
fer. '

"I don‘t think C—ML7 can beat us again.“ Schaf—
ter commented. "They won the first game on a cou-
ple of fluky goals. " _

The Tartans took Pitt. 4-3. and Schaeffer wasn't
looking to put the blame on anyone but the blue line
crew when he said. "You shouldn‘t need more than
three goals to win a hockey game. If you let more
than 20 shots go on goal. then you aren't playing
well on defense."

Pitt will meet Carnegie-Mellon on Sunday night
at the Civic Arena in the first game of the first an-
nual West Penn Hockey Tournament. Even though
the game is only exhibition and will not count in the
league standings, the Pitt skaters are out for re-
venge.

Schaeffer continued to explain just why Pitt
succumbed to the Tartans. saying. "They hustled
more than we did. that’s all there is to it. We were
just too confident." I V

A junior. Schaeffer has been with the Pitt team
since it was fiifst organized. three years ago. The
rugged blue liner has been playing hockey for seven
years and hasn't played any other position besides
defense. His experience has paid off and Schaeffer
is enjoying a successful season. He has only record-
ed three goals and six assists bt’1t Schaeffer. like
the team player he is. doesn‘t think that scoring is
that important to a defenseman. _

“I worry about my shot but if I’m going to
score,” Schaeffer remarked. “I just concentrate
on putting the puck on the net so our forwards like
(Tom) Lang and (Dave) Bahnson can pick up the

missing checks and allowing breaks.”

Before Pitt will meet C—MU on Sunday. the‘ .3"?-

skaters must travel to the Belmont Arena tonight

to meet Slippery Rock. In a game against the Rock- 
ets last season. Schaeffer was given the gate for 
leaving the bench to engage in a fight. Although he 7 

has curtailed his penalty record in that department

this year. Schaeffer still likes to see the rough style -if

of play around the league.

‘ "A lot of teams try to use that hard hitting‘__.’f
style." Schaeffer said. "but were the biggest and »
‘physically strongest team in the in the league. We-3 7‘
definitely have the toughest guys in the league on‘ 

our team."

Some criticism has been leveled at the Pitt, 
skaters, and in particular Denny Browne, for thejf}
way they handle themselves when the going gets

rough. C. H. Bender and the Duquesne Dukes pro-

vided the opposition for the last really big brawl 

that Pitt engaged in. .

Teamed with assistant captain Kerry Browne.”
Schaeffer will probably be found out on the Civic
Arena ice for the opening shift of the game and the
leathery defenseman has already formed a strateg.yTi_g
that he thinks will prove to be an important factor‘:
in the making of Pittfs revenge.

“I think we'll have to come out hitting more,’_
Schaeffer said. “I think it’s going to give us some?
good practice for our upcoming league gamexwithi
them (C-MU) and we could even put some of their
men out.”

Carnegie—l\/Iellon has to be expecting a fired up-;;

Pitt team when the two squads line up t'or the open-_!‘
ing faceoff at 7 p.m. Sunday. It might only be an ex‘=-3
hibition game. but Schaeffer and his teammates‘~
will be going all out to correct the local myth that-*
C-ML’ is the top college hockey team around Pitts-,_
burgh. "

  Pictures talk.

Some little boys don’t.

Some inner-city" ghettos have special schools.’ For little
boys who don’t talk.

Not mute little boys. But-children so withdrawn, so afraid
of failure, they cannot make the slightest attempt to do any-
thing at which they might fail. '

Some don’t talk. Some don’t listen. Most don’t behave. And
all of them don’t learn. '

One day someone asked us to help.

Through Kodak, cameras and ﬁlm were distributed to
teachers. The teachers gave the cameras to the kids and told
them to take pictures.

And then the miracle. Little boys who had never said any-.
thing, looked at the pictures and began to talk. They said
“This is my house.” “This is my dog.” “This is where I- like

to hide.” They began to explain, to describe, to communicate.
And once the channels of communication had been opened,
they began to learn. ' ‘ v _ _

We're helping the children of the inner-city. And we're
also helpingthe adults. We're involved in inner-city job pro-
grams. To train unskilled people in useful jobs.

What does Kodak stand to gain from this? Well, we're
showing how our products can help a teacher——and maybe
creating a whole new market. And we’re also cultivating
young customers who will someday buy their own cameras
and ﬁlm. But more than that, we’re cultivating alert, edu-
cated citizens. Who will someday be responsible for our society.

After all, our business depends on our society..So we care
what happens to it. ‘ -

More than a business.
