after months of work, and spe-

They have also used various

(See Editorial Page 4)

Senior ‘Court, judicial body
of Associated Women Stu-
dents, has voted to recom-

abolition of guilds for fresh-
man women.

The AWS Executive Committee
has passed the recommendation
and will call a meeting of Com-
mission, the legislative body. The
change, if approved by Commis-
sion, would necessitate a revision
of the by-laws according‘ to
Senior Court Chief Justice, Pat
Perri, Col. ’59. .

The guild system was instituted
to introduce women to activities
on the principle that they would
learn a spirit of co-operation
while working with fellow stu-
dents. .

It went into effect around
Thanksgiving after completion
of orientation by Senior Men-
tors. Women were discouraged
from joining activities until the
second semester.

Substitute plans have been dis-
cussed’ and will be presented to
Executive for approval. The Chief
Justice announced that although
newplans have not yet been de-
termined, the policy of discour-
aging participation in activities
will probably be retained.

/One proposal suggests that the
Guild Chairman might contact
school organizations during the
first semester to set up a ‘schedule
by which their representatives
would meet the freshmen _on des-
ignated days in the following se-
mester.

Nancy Houlihan, Col. ’60,
elected as Guild Chairman. will
become Freshman Activity Co-
ordinating Chairman. The
Freshman Council will work
with her in establishing the new
system.

Presently, the AWS Vice-Presi-
dent heads Freshman Council. The
former will assume the position of
co—ordinator of all standing com-

hittees of AWS.

Progress: ve Abolition
Senior Court contemplates a progressive move in pro-
posing abolition of the antiquated freshman guilds. ,

.. Some co-ordination of freshman activities is a good
idea, but the strict regimentation of the Guild program 1S

hardly the way to introduce women students to University

activities. _ , i

Conﬂicts have arisen in,the past with people who en-
ter the University with special activity talents which they
must sublimate for their first semester. _

It might happen to a freshman women, for instance,
would have a debate or publications special merit scholar-
ship on the same basis as the athletic scholarships are.
awarded. -

The loss of such an individual tolthe respective activity
is needless. This is not to say that the loss has actually.oc-
curred. , 4'

‘ ~_For freshman women have been known to sidetrack the
Guild or ,at least, attend the -Guild program whileyat the
same time participating in a University activity.

Why have a policy which is violated at present, and may
serve a purpose but one which has lost its original sig-
niﬁcance. '

,The substitute plans have not been revealed in their
entirety. It is to be hoped that they will provide a ﬂexibility
unkown to the present system. J .

For the woman who has trouble “breaking in” to activ-
ities, a representative from the respective group meeting

pwith her might provide the link to the group which is

needed.

The individual who has a talent, not latent but partially
developed, might enter the activity immediately" without
the boring tedium of an interest group.

Nuclear Name-Calling . . .-

Time's Rapid Fallout C a 

By Millard Anidur

This column is in commemoration of an edi-
torial which appeared in The Saturday Review Of

Litrerrature, and the ideals it encompassed.

Norman Cousins, editor of this publication, is
also on the executive committee of The National
Committee For‘A Sane Nuclear ‘
Policy.

Time magazine saw fit on.
April 21 to castigate, in their
usual bitter style, the members
of this group and their policies.

structive criticism but rumor .
andluntruth are hardly subject
matter for a news magazine.
The cutlines below what Time
termed “the well—heeled and in-
fluential supporters” p i c t u r e
‘read “Defenders of the unborn . .
enemies of liberty?”
Time's Monopoly
Cousins criticizes and anyone, in the‘ name of
decency, must heartily concur, that Time. “has no
monopoly either of knowledge concerning the

 

. or dupes or the

‘ threat of Communism or zeal in combatting it.”

The right of Time to disagree is not questioned,
merely their use of damaging “catch-phrases.”
Cousins recognizes Time’: use of “the spillover
technique” in labelling the whole group by the
actions of the member of_the Committee.
Although Cousins did not specify, he was obvi-
ously referring to Time’s statements on Linus Paul-
ing, “longtime supporter of Communist—line fronts.”
In the ﬁrst place, although Cousins did not men-
tion it, Pauling has been maligned far too much
because of his supposed Communist Association.
Be thatias it may, his proposals should be consid-
ered in their true light rather than smearing him
first and relegating his proposals to Limbo as a

, result.

The Man On The Cycle. . .

 
   
  

Pou|ing's Treoimeni « J \ 

Pauling appeared on the “Meet the Press” tele-
vision show a week ago; his program and that of
the Committee of which he- is a member were
knocked unmercifully by the panel in a thoroughly
unobjective manner.

Thinking Ameriizans must have been shocked
at this appraisal of the scientist and his views.

No-one can dispute the fact that some lives will

be shortened by the continuance of nuclear testing.

regardless of how the ﬁgures are juggled. No gene-

ticist believes that the effect upon the human being i

of radiation would be vastly different frfomtthe,
harmful one experimentally validated in other
animals.

Which is the greater evil is another question,
but distorting the issues is something -no nation
should do. ’

Time Magazine purports to know there is noth-
ing to, worry about from further testing. They
should report, not distort. ’ i

Cousins castigates Time for not bringing the

‘discussion to its logical concluding consideration,
the moral issue: Can the U.S. justify endangering

other natidhs against their protests?
Students‘ Responsibility ,,

It behooves college students to question the re-
’ports ‘of the Atomic Energy Commission when they
so, deﬁnitely contradict the truth, as the recent
statement that an underground explosion . could
not be detected past 250 miles from the explosion.

This statement was made at such time that it
was known that the explosion was detected as far
away as Alaska. _ g

It is equally important that publications should
present the facts and not opinions in news articles.

-This does not presume to say thatwe should all
stop reading Time “for with its large circulation we
cannot affordlto boycott the magazine-. We won’t
then know what misinformation is being fed to the
public.

Strmecki Assists

‘Professor Clarke

In Slavic Studies
BY ROSALIE GLAND

iThe University’s emphasis‘

on research is exempliﬁed by
the work of Professors James
Clarke and Joseph Strmecki.

The two researchers recent-

ly received notice of a Ford
Foundation grant to help ﬁnance
a source book on the Southern
Slavs.

Born and raised in Yugoslavia,
Strmecki came to the United
States in 1948 via Czechoslovakia
and France. In France he studied
political science at the University
of Paris . S

Educated in Yugoslavia

He received a master’s degree
in philosophy at the University
of Zagreb, now the capital of
Croatia.

Strmecki came to the United
States as a member of the steer-
ing committee of the “Interna-
tional Students’ Organization”
which was to hold a session at
the University of Chicago.

Persuaded by Chicago students,
he requested and received a per-
manent visa and began studying
for his PhD.

In 1951 he went to Indiana Uni-
versity where he taught political

science and history at the Insti-

tute of Eastern European Studies.

‘Primarily, however, he did re-

search dealing with Communism

in Southeastern Europe and the’

Soviet Union.

It was at Indiana that he and-

Clarke b e g a in collecting; and
selecting source material for a
history of the Southern Slavs.
Arrive at Pitt

When Clarke came to the Uni-
versity in 1956, Strmecki metwith
him over Christmas vacation. The
two men worked out a plan which
they submitted to Dean Geise for
approval. Strmecki came to Pitt in
February, 1957. '

Local Mitters Get Boost

From Hoover, Dunlap

By SALLY VVERNER

Pittsburgh can boast of two strong teams this season. In ‘

addition to the suprprising Pirates at Forbes Field, the Pan-
ther squad at Wildwood is one of the strongest teams in years,
and has hopes of a tournament bid. Leading the rooster for
the challenging squad are its captains, Ron Hoover and 'Jim

Dunlap.

The boys have much in common.
They both stand 6 ft., weigh 190
lbs., bat right-handed, love base-
ball, and are, as has been proven,
adept at the sport. Off the ﬁeld the
similarities are not so striking.
Here as individuals, they shine in
their own ﬁelds.

Hoover, an education senior,
majoring in History and Biology,

spent his first two years at Johns-'

town Center. Living in South
Fork, Pa. (near Elkstown, he
claims), Ron was able to commute
to school. There the outﬁelder
took an active part in activities,
and even coached a girls basket-

ball team.

Awards Given
At Sports Dinner

BY ED KoI.TIsKA
’ Sports Editor V

Varsity athletics for the 1957-1958 academic year has just about

come to a close with the honoring of athletes at the All-Sports Ban-
quet at the Pitt Wildwood Country Club. Three top awards high-
lighted the evening festivities.

. \Bob Richardson, a third year letterwinner in wrestling, from
Grove City. Pa., received the Pitt News Sports Award honoring an
outstanding athlete who has distinguished himself in school activi-
ties (other than varsity athletics) and in the class room. Some of
Bob’s activities included Chairman of Freshman Camp, President of
Sigma Chi Social Fraternity, Interfraternity Athletic Chairman. and
Chairman of a successful drive to send the Pitt Band to Miami.

The Charles C. Hartwig Award, honoring a senior who, in the
course of his undergraduate work, has done the most to promote and
sponsor the best interests of athletics at the University of Pittsburgh,
iwas presented to Julius Pegues from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Julius, the
fourth highest scorerin Pitt history with 1,050 points, was a regular
for three years and co—captain of the 1957-58 basketball team. He is

Orioles have already come in. His
record this season and to-p batting
average might very well inﬂuence

faces the army which might hold
him back for a few years.

The blue-eyed shortstop finds

“Baseball,” Jim feels, “will give
