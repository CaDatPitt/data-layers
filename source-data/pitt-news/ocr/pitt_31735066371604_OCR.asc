 Nathan J. Stark

resigns
medical
position

Nathan J. Stark, Pitt's senior
vice-chancellor for the health
sciences, announced Monday
night his resignation eﬂective
1 December 31 or as soon as a suc-

cessor can fill the position.

Stark told The Pitt News yes-
terday he has looked forward to
retiring from Pltt for the last
year. He said on Monday he
“needs a period of self-renewal,”
according to an article in yester-
day’s Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Stark’s announcement comes
in the wake of the June 30 resig-
nation of Donald Leon as dean
of Pitt’s School of Medicine and
the earlier demotion and depar-
ture of assistant dean for aca-
demic affairs Robert Olson.

On May 15, two weeks after
Leon announced his resignation
as dean, Pitt chancellor Wesley
Posvar assigned Stark and asso-
ciate senior vice-chancellor for
the health sciences Thomas
Detre the task of directing the
school until next fall, when a new
dean was to be hired.

Detre will retain his current
position but will also serve as
interim dean for an unspecified
period, the university has
announced.

William Pitt Union

ins woodwork honor

This clock  main level of the William Pitt

Union is among the many pieces of fine woodwork-
Ing for which the building has been recognized.

,By Lisa Popl
Staff Writer

\

it took nearly two years of coping
and complaining by disenchanted
Pitt students and employees, but it
was evidently worth the wait.

The university's recently reno-
vated William Pitt Union — which
serves as the student union for Pitt's
main campus — has received the
Architectural Woodwork- lnstitute‘s
third annual Award of Excellence.

The award is given to the single
project “that best represents the
highest quality achievement in
design and execution of wood-
work,” according to the local archi-
tectural firm of Williams Trebileock
Whitehead (WTW), which shared
the honor with Pitt and with the
Thomas-Kinsey Lumber Company
of Johnstown, Pa.

The building, formerly the Schen-
ley Hotel and currently home of sev-
eral university departments and
offices, was partially demolished in
December, l98l. Completed 2|
months later, in September, I983,
the overhaul cost SI3.9 million.

John A. Dencler, a WTW asso-
ciate and architect of the project,
said, “A major requirement of the
project was to restore the grand cere-
monial spaces of the old hotel to
their original magnificence.“

Changes and additions included
not only the restoration of the build-
ing's first two levels but also the
complete gutting of floors one
through seven. Through the removal
of lavatories and closets from the
former hotel rooms, 35 percent more
space was created, according to
WTW‘s lvan Santa-Cruz.

New windows, as well as new
heating, air conditioning, plumbing,
electrical and sprinkler systems,
were installed throughout the union
— but “the key element,“ Dencler
said, “was to unobtrusively incorpo-
rate 20th century improvements into
l9th century interiors."

it was through the comprehensive
and thorough use of new wood trim
and casework, fashioned and fin-
ished in the same opulent style and
manner as those of the old hotel,
that the award winners won the
recognition of the Architectural
Woodwork Institute.

The institute, based in Arlington,
Va., is a 30-year-old non-profit trade
association composed of over 600
millwork manufacturers and archi-
tectural woodwork suppliers from
all over the U.S.

An institute spokeswoman said
yesterday that the award carries no
monetary prize and that Pitt is the
first university to have won or
shared the honor.

‘Gorgeous’ Heinz Chapel
serves entire Pitt community

By Linda Powers
Staff Writer

For 50 years, Heinz Chapel has
provided Pitt students with a beauti-
ful place for religious worship and
quiet contemplation on an otherwise
bustling campus.

According to the chapel‘s director
of special services Elmer Eberley,
the non-denominational chapel is
available for several types of reli-
gious ceremonies, including wed-
dings and memorial services, in
addition to the Orthodox, Catholic
and Lutheran services held every
Sunday.

All services are performed by

members of the University Chap-
lains Association. As a non-
denominational

says, “All faiths may hold private
services here, after they go through
our office and schedule them.“

Although the entire Pitt campus is
less active during the sum_mer than
in the fall, chapel director Dean
Root reports that requests for pri-
vate use ofthe chapel ar_e still numer-
ous, especially for Holy Day services
and weddings.

Root says the privately scheduled
services are “generally for Pitt stu-
dents" but can be scheduled by
anyone associated with the univer-

» sity. “That includes alumni, faculty

and other employees, as well as _

immediate family members of
anyone connected with the univer-

sity.  According to Root, those re- 4'

strictions are “not part of our pol-
icy" but are the policy of the
University Chaplains Association.

Since its dedication in 1938, the
chapel has served as a breathtaking
memorial to HJ. Heinz and his
mother, Anna. With its 70-foot
stained glass windows and its elabo-
rate hand-carved oak altar, it is easy
to see why the chapel took IO years
to build and why Root considers it
the most beautiful building on cam-
pus. “lt’s gorgeous. There is no place
else like it here."

Wednesday Briefing

Parenthood workshop slated

Pittsburgh Planned Parenthood will offer a free workshop on the
topic “Deciding about Parenthood“ next Monday, July l6, from 6:30
to 9:30 p.m. at the organization's downtown headquarters at Ninth
Street and Fort Duquesne Boulevard. ,

Dayna Jornsay, director of education for Pittsburgh Planned Par-
enthood, said the workshop is the first of its kind offered by the
organization and one of only a few in the area.

The workshop is designed to explore medical and emotional issues
surrounding these questions: Do we want children? What are our
alternatives? Are there medical risks in delaying childbirth?

“In the past, people were expected to get married and have children
— period. Now society accepts more alternatives —— couples without
children, delayed parenthood and single parents. We want people to
know it's their decision," Jornsay said.

To pre-register for the workshop or for more information, call
434-8964 or 434-8950.

Cancer Institute funded

lhc Pittsburgh Cancer institute will receive $250,000 from Pennsyl-
vania‘s $8.5 billion state budget for fiscal year I984-I985, which was
signed by Governor Richard Thornburgh on June 29.

The institute, expected to be in full operation by this fall, is ajoint
effort shared by Pitt, Carnegie-Mellon University and six hospitals of
the University Health Center. \

The institute will have its patients screened and assessed at a newly
expanded Falk Clinic, which is now being remodeled. In the interim,
all examinations will take place at Children's Hospital.

New CGS Italian scholarship

Pitt‘s College of General Studies has announced that it will offer a
new scholarship for the study of the Italian language. .

The scholarship is the result of a special gift given in the name of
Anthony “Toto" Cicero, proprietor of the Cicero Building at 3609
Forbes Avenue in Oakland, which houses the Strand Bowling Lanes,
among other businesses. '

Cicero's son Peter said ‘yesterday that his father was told of the gift
given by relatives and by Pittsburgh's D’Alesandro family while on an
ocean cruise on May 29 —— Cicero’s 80th birthday.

The ‘elder Cicero is American-born but was raised in Italy from ages
3 to 17, when he returned to the United States, his son said. As a
tribute to the bilingual octogenarian‘s love of ltalian, the scholarship
will be awarded to a student who has attained superior acheivement in
the study of the language.

Pitt professor wins award

Rafael G. Quimpoga professor in Pitt's School of Engineering, has
been honored as “Outstanding Professor of the Year" by the Pitts-
burgh section of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

The award was presented at ASCE‘s annual meeting on May 26.
Quimpo, a ‘native Filipino, received his engineering degrees in the
Philippines, in Thailand and at Colorado State University.

He has authored 35 publications in his areas of technical interest
and has taught and presented technical papers in Europe, the Soviet
Union. East Asia and South America.

Opinions

 

From muiualdestruciion To mutual survival

In the June 13 issue of The Pit!
News, Marty Willis pointed out the
faults in the two superpowers‘
nuclear strategy. Known as Mutual
Assured Destruction or MAD, the
strategic theory holds that neither
the United States nor the Soviet
Union would risk a first strike

against the other because doing so
would, certainly lead to its own de-

struction as well. Since both sides
are defenseless against a nuclear
attack, their fear of retaliation deters
them from initiating a nuclear war.

As Willis points out, the strategy
is immoral: both sides target the
other side's populations. Moreover,
it is costly. Both sides continually
seek bigger, better and more stra-
tegic weapons sc that neither side
will doubt its opponent's deterrent
capability.

For these reasons, no one is quite
satisfied with MAD How. then,can
we break out of this MAD exis-

tence? Deterrence cannot — will not
— last forever. Arms control hasn‘t
worked; since I972, when the first
meaningful nuclear weapons treaty,
SALT l, was signed, both sides‘stra-
tegic arsenals have proliferated. It is
time to consider a new alternative:
Ballistic Missile Defense or BMD.
Developihg an effective defense

tic missiles ~—— those launched from
submarines and from the opponent‘s
soil - would entail a three-step
process:

0 Deployment, as soon as possi-
ble, of a silo defense to protect our
own land-based missiles from a
Soviet strike. These are our most
accurate missiles and thus pose the
greatest threat to the Soviet Union.
They are capable of taking out her
land-based missiles, not just her
population, and such missiles com-
pose 75 percent of the Soviet force
(and only about 35 percent of ours).
These missiles are in silos and are
highly vulnerable, making them a
tempting target for the Soviet
Union.

Silo defense is possible with
present-day technology. It would be
relatively inexpensive and could be
done within one to one and a half
years. Because it makes targeting
silos futile, it is consistent with
MAD.

It is not, nor could it be. perfect.
That is good. A perfect defense held
by only one side is destabilizing. The
Soviets may fear that, with a nuclear
shield, a president would actually
risk war. However, this first step
leaves our cities vulnerable. We
would only have institutionalized

0 Deployment ofa first generation
space-based defense. This system
will intercept Soviet missiles early in
their trajectory. If the Soviet missile
holds, say, l0 warheads, this defense
battery will destroy the missile
before it releases its warheads. A
backup system will target the war-
heads that leak through, increasing
our chances of destroying them.

We would thus begin to move
from Mutual Assured Destruction
toward Mutual Assured Survival.
Again, the system will not be perfect,
but that is good, for the reasons cited
above. The system would remain a
deterrent. not an instrument of con-
flict. It would increase the uncer-
tainty of a Soviet planner who might
contemplate a first strike, and uncer-
tainty is the essence of deterrence.

If this system were only 20 percent
effective, that would still raise the
uncertainty of even a massive attack.
By this point, the Soviets may be left
with little capability — or incentive
—- to consider prosecuting a nuclear
war. Moreover, it is in fact the case
that we could develop a BMD with
an effectiveness rate of much higher
than 20 percent within I0 years.

The system would also lend itself
to second generation space defense
- improvement over time to insure

against the threat ofincoming ballis- MAD. We should then proceed to: greater effectiveness, while the

start-up costs for such systems
would be high. the follow-up costs
would not be. Unlike those for
offensive weapons, defensive costs
are finite. Beyond the relatively
minor costs of maintenance and
enhancement, there would be no
need to add newer and greater sys-
tems.

There would be no reliance on
perception or on the rationality of
your opponent. If he were to launch
a small-scale attack, a defense sys-
tem could absorb it. lfa third coun-
try —— say, Libya —— were to acquire
the bomb and launch an attack, or if
one were launched accidentally, we
could intercept it without having to
respond in kind.

0 After deployment of space-
based BM D, we should proceed
from MAD to MAS, from Mutual
Assured Destruction to Mutual
Assured Survival. By this point, we
and the Soviets could share our
space defense technology to ensure
that both sides will be freer from fear
of nuclear attack. MAD will simply
no longer apply. as neither side
could be destroyed by an attack
from the other. Both sides would
face increased uncertainty and
would rule out attack as a means of

resolving conflict.

arms control. Both sides will have
adjusted their priorities, from ensur-
ing that an offensive attack will get
through to ensuring that their defen-
sive systems will work as effectively
as possible. The fewer weapons a
BMD has to face, the more effective
it will be. Both parties may come to
appreciate a common interest in
reducing their stockpiles. Thus,
literally billions of dollars, which
otherwise would have gone into the
never-ceasing offensive weapons
production line. could be saved.
The system would be stabilizing.
lf both sides determined that there is
no point in launching a nuclear
attack, that option obviously would
diminish as a policy alternative. The
system would ensure survival, not
destruction, in a fashion which is
actually possible, not based on uto-
pian and illusory hopes, the failed
bases of disarmament.

imagining a world which does not

world considerably safer from the
threat of nuclear weapons. and you

Diamond in the rough

ENTERTAINMENT/THE PITT NEWS SUMMER MAGAZ|NE/ PAGE 5

Song-inspired movies represent one ofthe lesser recent trends in cinema. The
reason behind the general lack of success is easily apparent — the three-minute
pop or country composition houses a limited quantity of characterization,
conflict and plot. Screenwriters face the awkward responsiblity ofstretching the
material over a two—hour time slot.

The newest example, Rhinestone, lists singer Glen Campbell’s “Rhinestone
Cowboy” (penned by Larry Weiss) as its inspiration. Except that a funny thing
happened on the way to the movies — this time, the process actually worked.

Why? Partly because Rhinestone’s plot bears little resemblance to the
country-boy-makes—good—in-the—big-city themeofthe song. And mostly because
stars Sylvester Stallone and Dolly Parton make an engaging couple as a New
York City cab driver and Tennessee-bred singer, respectively. Screenwriters
Stallone and Phil Robinson worked with the old, faithful Pygmalion plot and
put together —- surprise! ~— a thoroughly enjoyable romantic comedy.

Onthe medical front...

 

   

By Peggy Ferrl
T Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical School has been the focus
of attention over the resignations of

r. Thoms Detre

key administrators and the recent
raise in tuition rates. Some students
and faculty members have expressed
concern over the school's manage-
ment and morale, and they use the
steady, yearly tuition increases as an
example of the problems facing the
medical school. . "

The problems were compounded
in light of Monday night’s sudden
resignation of vice-chancellor of the
health sciences Nathan Stark.

Stark and associate vice-
chancellor for the health sciences
Dr.Thomas Detre were both named
toioversee the school following the
resignation of Dean Donald Leon in
early May. Pitt chancellor Wesley
Posvar announced this and other
administrative changes at the Board
of Trustees meeting on May l5.

“For a year, l’ve been looking for-
ward to retirement. The opportunity
came along for me to re-enter the
law profession, and I decided it was
in the best interest of myself and the
university to resign,” Stark said.

“We are trying to form a search
committee now,” he said. Stark’s
resignation becomes effective
December 31 or as soon as his suc-
cessor is in place. i ,

Stark denied that disputes within
the school of medicine lead to his
resignation. “Everything you read is
absolutely accurate,” he said.

Pitt biochemistry professor
Robert Glew, however, said his
main concern is the “low morale” of
the medical school. In an interview,
Glew said Detre does not have the
faculty's trust. “Detre,” he said,
“commands so little respect  that
the only solution is to get an outside
dean  one who is committed to
bringing the practice plans under
control.”

A practice plan allows Pitt doc-
tors to use clinical facilities to treat
their private patients.

Glew has repeatedly asked that a
greater percentage of the income
made by doctors who use the univer-
sity facilties be funneled back into
Pitt‘s operating budget.

In a brief interview, Detre dis-
missed concerns over the leadership
of the medical school as “vague"and
explained that there is often uncer-
tainty associated with all transitions
in leadership. »

He added that he “plans to do
absolutely nothing” to quiet such
concerns since they have “no
substance."

Faculty member Dr. Gerald S.
Levey said that morale at the medi-
cal school “is quite high, regardless
of the problems of the institution.“

“lt‘s strong," he said. “People help
to make it strong. lt’s a superb medi-
cal school."

Dr. D.A. Abraham, chairman of
the department of pharmacy, said of
the changes, “l think that this will be
a move to make an excellent medical
school.”

Leon repeated that rumored dis-
agreements with Detre did not con-
tribute to his decision to resign.

“The disagreements were very
minor," Leon said. He concluded
that‘the feeling that his “wings were
clipped a little" was balanced by the
benefits of working with Detre. He
admitted Detre’s leadership style is
“very different” from his own and
added that any “insecurity  felt by
the medical school will“"‘settlc down
as things get rolling."

Detre said Pitt will continue to
emphasize a revitalization of the
basic sciences. Leon said the con-
tinued revitalization is important
and stressed the need to recruit
chairmen to fill the vacancies in the
basic sciences. Vacant chairs have
included the department of medicine

and, although resources were

limited, Leon said it was apparent to
him that those recruitments were
“absolutely critical."

“I have been criticized for neglect-
ing the basic sciences, but the fact is
that it was part of a game plan ..."‘
Leon said, claiming that he recruited

first to fill vacancies in the clinical
departments and let the basic scien-
ces wait because other recruitments
held the opportunity to “rapidly
enhance resources and attract more
income.”

“All in all,” he added, “seven
vacant chairs have been filled, and
there has been an increase in faculty
from 400 to 700, accompanied by a
substantial growth in income.” He
estimates it cost approximately $5
million to redevelop the department
of medicine and $2 million to recruit
basic science chairpersons.

Leon said that of the money
needed to redevelop and refurbish
departments, 80 percent did not
come from university funds. He
explained he has been able to cut
$700,000 from the school‘s subsidy
and balance the budget.

 

“I'm sure the ‘subsidy ‘ can be
decreased further," he said. The
Senate Budget Policies Committee
had recommended in their
December 16 report on “Practice
Plans ofthe School of Medicine and
Their lmpacts on the Clinical and
Basic Science Depa.rtments”that the
medical school return to operating
“solely on the funds it generates.”

It suggested this be done over a
three-year period “with at least a 30
percent reduction in the present sub-
sidy each year,” Leon said.

The recent report from the Ameri-
can Medical Association and the
Association of American Medical
Colleges Liaison Committee on
Medical Education (LCME) is
another indication of the school's
quality, Leon said.

“It's a very good review," he said.

Dr. Donald Leon joined the
faculty of the Pitt School of Medi-
cine in 1965. In 1967, he became an
assistant professor in the division of
cardiology at Magee- Women is Hos-

pital. Leon was appointed vice--

The LCME team toured Pitt facil-
ities between last October 25 and 28
and concluded that the school
“enjoys a number of impressive
strengths," among them: strengths
in the clinical departments; the dedi-
cation of students, faculty and
administrators; and the revitaliza-
tion of the basic sciences, including
the recruitment of chairs in the anat-
omy and biochemistry departments
and of an associate dean who will be
responsible for the program.

%"%ark called the clinical program

“the best in the country."

The report, however, indicated
concerns that the revitalization is
not complete. “Concern continues

, over the future of pharmacology and

for the permanency of the funding
commitments from the university
and the clinical departments."

Vacancies, it continued, currently
exist in the chairs of pharmacology,
physiology and ophthalmology and,
due to the aging of other administra-
te‘, vacancies can be expected in
several other departments.

In addition, the report said the
student aid office “appears to be
operating in a sub-optimal way....
This is especially critical, given the
high tuition rates and the shrinking
financial aid available.”

Pitt’s medical school has been
accredited for five years, and it must
submit a progress report to the
LCME by December l985._,Leon
said this is standard practice.

He said the matter is serious
because the curricula is “configured
in an old-fashioned way and needs
to be changed substantially." He
said he envisions a change wherein
the faculty become “curriculum
managers" and spend more time
doing problem-solving exercises
with a small group of students. This,
he said, would provide “hands-on
involvement in the quickest learning
method.”

The medical school nearly lost its
acreditation four years ago, when
the LCME review team gave it a
two-year accreditation, the lowest
possible period. ‘

therefore past the “life expectancy“
gost, since the average term is
V years.

Leon described his personal goal
for his term as one of “striking out
hard for excellence  securing [Pitt]
firmly among the greats.”

He said Pitt belongs to the
“haves" —— universities whose
research and reputation is able to
attract high quality faculty and a
substantial percentage of the
‘Nﬁonal Institute of Health grants.

Leon will retain his position as
professor of medicine in the division
of cardiology following a six-month
sabbatical in the fall.

“Fundamentally," Leon said, “the
deanship is a very complexjob." He
added that there is “no question that
both [Starkand Detre]  are more
than capable to provide the school
with the_management it needs.

“I thought in the aggregate it was i

better for the school to have new
leadership,“ said Leon, explaining
the reasons for his decision to resign.

He said he has not been making
progress at the rate he had pre-
viously and that this is the time for
someone with new ideas to step in.

Leon began his career as acting
dean of Pitt's medical school in Sep-
tember I978. He explained he is

Leon said he has no idea if this will . 0

be implemented and Stark later told

The Pitt News the faculty would 
have to be consulted before such a T

program could be implemented.

Tultlon goes up

Medical school student Elizabeth
Wright admitted she is “a bit in the
dark” about the goings-on in the
medical school, but she does not see
morale as a problem.

“People like the school very
much. It [the recent set of changes]
doesn't seem to have affected people
too much," Wright said.

Concerning the recent tuition
increase, she said, “People [stu-
dents] can raise the funds. Financial
ability is not a consideration for
admission.” ~

Dean of student affairs Frances
Drew agreed. “Everybody‘s hassled
for money," she said. “There has
been panic [over tuition rates] for at
least two years nationally.”

Steve Hasley, a recent medical
school graduate, felt that the “high
cost of medical education is going to
make some real changes on who
applies and who ﬁnishes.”

Drew added that the recent ad-
ministrative upheavals will not have
any impact on the students.

Another medical school student,
who asked not to be identified, said,
“We’re really very secluded from all
of it [the political and personal con-‘
flicts in the school].” However,
“there are lots of rumors ﬂoating,”
according to Hasley,

Vice-chancellor Stark placed the

. blame for the high tuition rates on A

the Pennsylvania state legislature.
He said that the legislature “has not
granted a one-cent increase in its
allocation to the medical school,”
giving the reason for the 9.4 percent
raise in second-year medical ‘school
tuition, which rose from $10,600 per
two terms to $1 l,600 for that same
period for state residents. Non-
residents can expect to pay Sl6,400
for that same third year.

In-state tuition for all other years
was also increased. First-year Penn-
sylvania resident students willsee a
4.3 percent increase, while their
third- and fourth-year peers will pay
7.l and 5.3 percent more,
respectively. 

University of Connecticut medi-
cal school students pay $5,200 per
year if they are state residents and
$9,755 if they are not, while their
peers at the University of Chicago, a
private institution, pay $10,377 for
their first and second years. and
$13,571 for the third and fourth
years.

rate at faculty

Stark said he felt “positive" about
the medical school. He said he had
“no idea" who would become the
next dean, but dismissed the idea of
Dr. Detre’s assuming the position.

Glew expressed concern about the
number of faculty leaving the school
for other institutions.

“It's not just the young faculty;
even senior faculty are leaving
because they see a poor future for

_the basic sciences. The basic sciences

are the backbone of other programs
that have traditional departmental
structures like [those of] Yale and
the Univeristy of Chicago."

Pitt microbiology professor Dr.
Saleem Khan said the young faculty
members were “upset” by the recent
administrative changes. He said that
the lackof information about the
school's future after the changes was
a primary cause.

“It is a wait and see attitude now,”
Khan said. “The situation is defi-
nitely better, and nobody would be
foolish enough to leave until we
know the final outcome.”

Vice-Chance/Ior of Health Sciences Nathan Stark

Making medical history  

November 10, 1983: Assistant dean for academic affairs Dr. Robert
Olsen asked to resign by medical school dean Dr. Donald F. Leon.
Olsen was asked to resign for what was termed his “disruptive philoso-
phy of management.” Olsen cited the medical school's interest in
placing less emphasis on the basic sciences as the reason for his
dismissal. .

January 30, 1984: Olsen relieved of his duties as director of the
Heinz Nutrition Center by Dr. Thomas Detre, associate senior vice-
chancellor for the health related professions. Grant funds totaling
$220,000 were returned on grounds that Olsen would be unable to
oversee center since he was no longer a senior administrator.

May 1, 1984: Dean Donald F. Leon resigned the deanship effective
June 30, I984. Leon cited his interest in returning to academic com-
mitments as the reason for his resignation. Leon will remain on the
medical school faculty.

May 15, 1984: Pitt chancellor Wesley Posvar appoints /Stark and
Detre to oversee the administration of the school until a new dean is
chosen. '

July 9, 1984: Vice-chancellor of the health sciences Nathan Stark
resigns effective December 3l or until a successor can be chosen,
explaining that he wishes to return to law practice. A search commit-
tee should be in place by September, and a new dean will be chosen
after Stark‘s'replacement is found. Dr. Detre will serve as interim dean

and remain in his position as senior vice-chancellor for the health ,

related professions. .
Dr. Olsen will assume a postion at the State University of New York
at Stonybrook in the fall.

Confidence
Wiley freshman
looking to start

By Joe Zeﬂ
Senior Editor

There might be questions about
Pitt recruit Dante Wiley’s throwing
arm, but there is no doubt about his
confidence.

“I’ve got all the confidence in the
world," said Wiley, a Parade All-
America from Jeannette who said he
believes that he can beat outjuniors
John Congemi, John Cummings
and Chris Jelic for starting quarter-
back in the fall.

“Yeah, I think so,” Wiley said.
“Congemi isn’t as fast as I am and his
arm is not as strong as mine, so I
think I have a little advantage over
him.

“Cummings, too. Niether of them
is as tall or as big as me. I'm quicker
and faster than either of them 
than any of the quarterbacks.“

Wiley (6-2, 203 lbs.) completed 60
of 134 passes for 900 yards and I2
touchdowns and led Jeanette to the
WPIAL Class AA title.

., He chose Pitt over Penn State but
tore ligaments in his right elbow
after a 207-foot javelin toss in April.
The injury kept him from defending
his I983 PIAA Class AA
championship.

“My elbow is completely healed,”
Wiley said. “I was told to rest it for
about three or four months because
some of the ligaments were torn
from the bone, but now it’s fine."

Wiley said the injury never
affected his ability to throw a foot-
ball. He plays shortstop for
Jean«r'_1ette‘s American Legion base-
ball Learn‘ and will start in the West-
ern Legion All-Star Game at Three
Rivers Stadium July l7.

Wiley inspected Pitt's passers at
spring drills in April and was not
impressed.

“I think they are good athletes. l’ll
just do my best to become first-
string. I watched them in the spring,
and I didn't see them do anything I
couldn‘t do as well or better."

Congemi (6-I, 178 lbs.) replaced
an injured and then-redshirted
Cummings after the first game of
last season. He completed 59 percent
of his passesfbr l,94O yards and I6
touchdowns.

“I‘m starting the first game, no
question about that," Congemi said.

“Dante’s very talented, and I’ve

heard that he’s a very good quarter-
back, but there are a lot of things
that you must learn before becoming
the starting quarterback at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh“

Cummings, who hopes to
rebound frmo a broken collarbone,
agreed that Wiley‘s confidence may
not be so well—founded.

“I think it‘s good that he‘s confi-
dent, but when it comes down to the
field, the awards don‘t matter. It
doesn’t matter what happened in
high school. You are starting from
zero. Sure, he’s a fine athlete, but I’d
like to see what happens.”

Congemi, an all-state and All-
America passer as a senior at St.
Thomas Aquinas High School in
Fort Lauderdale, recognizes Wiley‘s
situation.

“He's my teammate now, and I
have nothing against him. It was the
same way with me when I came in
here. I wanted to start, and I kneW_I
had no chance with Dan Marino in
there. Dante's in the same situation.

The quarterback situation at Pitt
could become even stickier when Joe
Felitsky, a transfer from Notre

Dame, becomes eligible as a sopho-'

more in I985. That does not shake
Wiley. .

“He's just another person that I
have to compete with,” Wiley said.
“I feel the same about him as I do
any other Pitt quarterback. He's
another obstacle in my path. All I
know about him is that he‘s from
Pittsburgh Central - — that's it."

Wiley won his All-America
honors as a defensive back. Panther
coaches have discussed that option
with him, but Wiley wants to be the
first black quarterback at Pitt since
Robert Haygood, who lettered in
I974 and I975.

“I'm sticking at quarterback,“
Wiley said. “There may be an option
to play defensive back in the future,
but I'm going to try quarterback
first. I have a shot at it.

“There would have to be some
problems to make me move, and
they would have to be some real big
problems."

Pollock tracking
grid scholarship

By Laurie Kubll
Staff Writer

During his first two years at Pitt,
Brian Pollock was one of the track
team‘s top sprinters, and in Febru-
ary of 1983, he won the Big -East
indoor title in the 300-meter dash.
But come September, he will don
pads and cleats for the Panther foot-
ball team with hopes of making his
mark in Pitt’s receiving corps.

His playing is contingent, how-
ever, on how well he does in his
classes this summer. Pollock had to
sit out last season because of aca-
demic ineligibility. Receiving the

Head football coach Foge Fazio
said that if Pollock isn't receiving
another form of aid, he would be
given the football scholarship.

“We‘re carrying [Olympic

think it's such a big deal (whether
Pollock plays under the track or the

Rhinestone
shines ‘

continued from page ﬁve

Jake (Parton) provides the
main attractions at the Rhine-
stone, a country-western night-
club in New York. But seeking
release from a three-year con-
tract, Jake makes a bet with her
boss, the club’s actively lecher-
ous owner-operator: if she can
turn the next “normal” man she
meets into a succesful “rhine-
stone cowboy” within two
weeks, her obligation will be
cancelled. Should she fail, how-
ever, the boss earns a five-year
option and an evening in bed
with her.

Enter Nick Martinelli (Stal-
lone), cab driver, for whom
country music is “worse than
liver." Still, in exchange for his
own taxicab, he agrees to partici-
pate in the experiment, and Jake
escorts him home to Leiper’s
Fork, Tenn., for some intense

lessons in the acquisition of
“country.” 

Rhinestone pokes fun equally
at urban and rural stereotypes.
The film presents delightful con-
trasts as the displaced Nick wets
his feet in country living. Humor
arises naturally from the situa-
tion — at times, obvious and
cheerfully vulgar, but always in
good fun.

Stallone proves — or at least
offers convincing evidence —
that he can handle straightfor-
ward comedy. His Nick adjusts
to the thorough culture shock
with unﬂagging, swaggering self-
assurance. Voluptuous Dolly
Parton appears entirely com-
fortable onscreen and in charac-
ter. Her _ Jake, despite grave
doubts, pleads and prods and
sparks her pupil with gusto, and
determination. An odd couple,
certainly, but appealing in this
context.

Supporting-cast honors go to
Richard Farnsworth, sly and
charming as Jake’s father; to
Ron Leibman, smug and

smarmy and confident as the

vwui’ nu, .......

Rhinestone’s sex-hungry pro-

prietor; and to Tim Thomerson, ’

sequinnedand fringed as Nick s
good-ole-boy inspiration and
Jake's ex-fiance. Terrific ensem-

~‘ ble work. i

Dolly Parton also composed
the musical score -— a dozen and
a half (or thereabouts) tunes tai-
lored for her own considerable
vocal ability and sympathetic to
the limitations of Stallone's, as
well. He’s no singer, as he dem-
onstrates with execrable rendi-
tions of“Tut.ti Fruiti”and “Devil
With a Blue Dress” early in the
film. But he can sell a song with
conviction when he works at it,
managing some effective duets

V with Parton during the climax.

Bob Clark directs with a good
eye for slapstick, somewhat
reminiscent of the screwball
comedies from the 1930s -— an

. odd switch from the rather juve-

nile raunchiness of P0rky's and
Porky's II. Rhinestone offers
instead some of the most engag-
ing summer entertainment of
1984.
