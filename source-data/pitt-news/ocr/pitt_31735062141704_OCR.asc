trar John G. Quick, in an announce-
ment of plans for enlarging upon the
system of early registration success-
fully carried out last year.

While approximately 87 per cent of
the students in the ﬁve undergradu-
ate schools took advantage of the new
system last year, the registrar antici-
pates that. all regularly enrolled stu-
dents will be registered -by the close
of the forthcoming two-week period.

Registration notices will be mailed
to all students from the office of the
registrar during the holiday period.
During that same time, the registrar
will submit preliminary reports of
failures and probable failures to the
deans of the several schools. Second

ginning January 4, in accord with pro-
visions. appearing on the notices

tinuing in the same courses and sec-
tions pursued duringthe ﬁrst semes-

Frosh Women
Plan Debates

Squad to Meet Upperclass
Association Tuesday

The freshman squad of the VVo-
men’s Debating Association met at a
dinner at Heinz House Monday even-
ing. Talks were given by Genevieve
Blatt, president of the association;
Zora Unkovich, upperclass adviser to
the group, and Miss Theresa Kahn,
coach.

Although freshman women received
assignments to their activities units
only this week, the debating group
has already formulated plans for an
extensive program, entirely independ-
ent of the upperclass squad. The
question to be studied is the question
being used by the highschools in the
state this year, “Resolved: That At
Least One-half of All State and Local
Revenues Should be Derived From
Sources Other Than Tangible Prop-
erty.” -

Debates with several of the neigh-
boring city high schools are now be-
ing arranged by Miss Kahn for the
freshman squad which this year con-
sists of eleven women, the largest
number the group has ever com-
prised.

The next meeting of the squad will
be held jointly with the upperclass
members on Tuesday evening at 6
o'clock,_ at Heinz House. Following
the dinner, the groups will separate,
the upperclassmen to discuss
Debts,” while the freshmen will con-
sider the tax question.

Players Oﬁer
“Craig_’_s_Wife”

Play I-Ias Interesting, Com-
plicated Plot

Mr, Carl B. Cass, director of Pitt
players, has chosen “Craig’s Wife,’f
by George S. Kellyéas the second
long play which he will produce this
season. “Craig’s Wife,” being ex-
tremely difficult to cast as well as to
produce, has necessitated a s-econd
tryout for the leading part of Mrs.
Craig. However, with the exceptions
of several minor parts, Mr. Cass has
been able to successfully cast the
show.

Playing opposite Mrs. Craig, who
married so that she might have a
home and then found that she could
very well do without her husband and
yet have it, is “Walter Craig,” played
by Carl Schwartz, Col. ’35, who is a
“romantic fool” to the extent that he
is almost taken over by his designing
wife.

The younger element is represented
in “Craig’s Wife” by ‘Ethel Landreth,”
Elaine Blauvelt, Col. ’34, who contem-
plates a marriage for love with a.
young and handsome professor of ro-
mance languages, “Eugene Freder-
icks,” Fred Kiger, Col. '36, against the
dissuasions of her aunt, Mrs. Craig,
who argues for women’s -self suﬂicien-
cy and the poor business of marriage
unless the bride intends to rule the
home.

Craig’s aunt, Miss Austin, a sensi-
ble, kindly old woman played by Eliz-
abeth Wingerter, sees through Mrs.
Craig’s scheme and tries. todisclose
it to the incredulous Craig in time for
him to assert himself before his wife
has completely subdued his person-

KellerPlaced
In Charge Of“
  Junior Prom

Student Council Accepts
Financial Report for
Sophomore I-Iop

Plan Class Organization

Selected from a. group of eight stu-
dents who petitioned Student Council,
William V. Keller, Col., was named
Tuesday night to head the 1933 Junior;
Prom committee. The Prom has beeni
deﬁnitely scheduled for Friday even-
ing, February 17.

Keller, a member of Kappa Sigma,
social fraternity, and Druids, national
honorary sophomore activities frater-
nity, has been serving during the cur-
rent semester as social chairman of
the College Association,
to past membership on the Soph Hop
and the Freshman Dance committees,
he has also been an outstanding mem-
ber of the varsity track team for two
years.

To Repair Panther Suit

Other business brought before
Council Tuesday night included the
acceptance of Treasurer Edward
Breene’s report on the Soph Hop,
further discussion of class organiza-
tion for the College and Schools of
'Education‘ " and Business Administra-
tion, the appropriation of $19.46 for
the cleaning and repairing of the
Panther suit, and the appointment of
a committee to investigate the cost of
providing keys for Council members.

The eight candidates who petitioned
for the chairmanship of the Junior
Prom, in addition to Keller, were
Edgar Dowling, Bus. Ad., Frank Mc-
Cabe, Eng., William L. Herron, Bus.
Ad., John G. Novak, Col., Edward F.
Nowl-in, Eng., George W. Blum, Eng.,
and Kenneth C. Host, Eng.

Keller and Herron received an
equal number of votes on two prefer-
ential test ballots. Keller was elected
when President Rose called fo-r the
ﬁnal vote on the two candidates,

Council, in unanimous action, moved
that petitions for the chairmanship of
all class dances be signed only by
members of the class sponsoring the
"dance, and that the petitions so state
for the beneﬁt of candidates. This
action followed the revelation that
several petitioners for the Prom chair-
manship had submitted the signatures
of members of other classes.

Soph Hop Loses

Treasurer Breene stated that, at the
time of latest reckoning, the Soph Hop
showed a deﬁcit of $17.70. Expenses
for the dance totalled $608.70, while
the total income reached only $591.00.
It was pointed out that if the dance
failed to show a proﬁt after all ac-
counts had been settled, the deﬁcit
would be cared for out of a balance
that remains in the sophomore class
treasury from its Freshman Dance.

Arthur Goldberg, Col. ’33, chairman
of Traditions committee, reported
plans for a meeting of activities lead-
ers and administration members after
the Christmas holidays, for the pur-
pose of discussing the practicality of
class organization in the three above-
mentioned schools.

Upon =1 motion of Dorothy Lewis,
Ed, ’34, Goldberg’s suggestion that the
$19.46 received from the Panther suit
drive be used to clean and repair the
old suit for the Pitt-Southern Califor-
nia football game was passed by the
councillors. The motion stated. how-
ever, that the money should be ex-
pended only in the event that the
amount could not be received else-
where.

Revival of the subject “keys for
councillors” claimed the attention of
the student sol-ons during the last few
minutes of the meeting, The time-
worn bugaboo of how to give Council
members ofﬁcial recognition entered
the ﬁrst stages of actual progress

Mrs. Pinchot Is Eighth In
List of Noted Women
to Appear Here

Is Active In Politics

Dean Thyrsa VV. Amos, in express-
ing the signiﬁcance of VVoman’s Day,
says, “I think Vv’oman’s Day is it lovely
tradition to have here at Pitt. It is
quite ﬁtting that once a. year we
pause and remember the pioneer wo-
men who opened the University and
consider the privileges we now have.”

Cornelia Bryce Pinchot is appro-
priately added to the list of notable
speakers who have helped to make
Woman’s Day a signiﬁcant tradition
in the life of Pitt women.

Woman Suffrage Leader

Although she is outstanding as the
wife of the Governor of Pennsyl-
vania, Mrs. Pinchot is socially and po-
litically prominent in her own right.
A lea-dae-r in women’s suffrage, she was
the ﬁrst woman in Pennsylvania to
demand a political organization for
Republican women and to insist that
women serve on political committees
on equal terms with men. She has
run for office in her own right, and
has headed both men and women in
important, political movenients.

Before her marriage, Mrs. Pinchot
was Cornelia Elizabeth Bryce, the
daughter of Congressman Bryce, who
became minister to Holland under
the: administration of President Taft.
Her grandfather was mayor of New
York, and her great-grandfather
was Peter‘ Cooper, the inventor and
builder of the ﬁrst locomotive in
America.

An active life in politics has not
kept Mrs. Pinchot from other inter-
ests, however. During her versatile
life, she has traveled to all parts of
the world. She accompanied Gover-
nor Pinchot on his expedition to the
South Sea Islands in his search for
specimens of animal life for the Na-
tional Museum at Washington, D. C.
During this trip she managed the
cooking and housekeeping in addition
to helping her husband in his scien-
tiﬁc investigations.

Has Noted Predesessors

Mrs. Pinchot is the eighth of a list
of distinguished women to take part
in VVonian’s Day programs. The ﬁrst
Woman’s Day program took place in
1926, when Anna Garlin Spencer, lec-
turer in Social Sciences at Columbia
University was the speaker. In Jan-
uary, 1927, Miss Emma Gunther, pro-
fessor of household arts at Columbia,
spoke, and in December of the same
year, Dr. Anna Louise McLeod of the
Euthenics Institute at Vassar College,
gave the address.

Mrs, Eleanor VVembridge spoke on
“College Girls——'l‘rial by Jury” in
1928, and in 1929 Miss Margaret Den-
eke of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford,
headed the program with a talk and
musical selections dealing with Cho-
Din’s life and works. Dr. Mary Went-
worth McConnaghy, adviser in mental
hygiene at Mount Holyoke, was the
speaker in 1930, and last year Madame
Cornelia Carobji, noted educator of
India, discussed “Vvoman Through an
Eastern Vvindow.”

Totals $10,815

Amount Is $5,500 Less Than
That of Last Year

According to ﬁgures released from
the office of Dr. Samuel B, Linhart,
University treasurer, the Welfare
drive conducted on the campus for the
last two weeks has produced a total
of $10,815.28. Although this amount is
approximately $5,500 less than last
year, the chairman considers the re-
sults good.

In the thirteen departments of the
University, a total of $9,684.55 was
subscribed by the faculty and the em-
ployes, the remainder, $1,130.73, being
offered by the students,

In the ﬁrst group the Mellon Insti-
tute led with $2,325, followed closely
by the College and the Department of
Buildings and Grounds with $1,836
and $1,590.80.

Dr. Linhart stated that all the sub-
scriptions have not been reported yet,
and that this total will be swelled by
some which will be received later.

The drive was divided into two
parts, Dr. Linhart handling the fac-
ulty and employes and VV. VV. Men-
denhall faculty adviser of YMCA,
taking charge of the student cam-
paigu. During the drive seminars
were established in the professional
schools and committees appointed to
talk to the lower class men.

of the group of physical education instructors and students who went
to Harold Hubler's cabin in the mountains near Penn State.
“Deadeye” Holloway was out for vengeance;

He imagined it was a bear, so he

slept by the kitchen door of the cabin resolutely defying the impend-
ing danger of a night attack by this soap-eating bear.

The night

vigil was too much for the dauntlesrs¢

awakened, he felt the tail, opened his
eyes, blea.ry from sleep, and saw a
dim apparition amble into the other
room. Did Fred yell? No, Fred
didn't yell. His thoughts were for the
safety of the others; he imagined
John Dambach all lacerated and bleed-
ing; he saw Dave Demarche and Joe
Jones with their heads smashed in by
a single blow of the bear’s paw; and
Will-t is more he saw Harold Hubler
wrestling in a ﬁerce death struggle
with this giant denizen of the moun-
tains.

Ave, Fred’s thoughts were for the
others, and his actions too. He fum-
bled around loading his trusty pistol;
then he crept into the other room.
He could s_ee its glaring eyes in the
corner as it turned toward him.

racking experience that ﬁnally got a
sleepy “What the H . . . . . . up?”

Theodore VV. Biddle, assistant to
the dean of men, was informed \Ved-
nesday that the. boys and girls woke

up that morning and didn’t know:

which houses they were in. “A strange
case,” mused several fraternity presi-
dents, and when the search was over
they found that only nine of the
twenty—four houses were still marked.
The police were summoned and a
thorough search was n1a.de of the
various premises for clues which
might include hidden footprints, a
lost screwdriver, or maybe a copy of
the Pitt News.

The nameplates were valued at
various sums ranging from $15 to $50.

Friend Santa Claus may be de-

the Pitt Panthers December of-

vance copy to the old gent with

self into a fever. The campus

“Doc” Carlson makes the book
a little more serious with a
straight sketch, but with the ex-
ception of one or two brilliant
feature articles, the rest of the
copy predicts a screamingly funny
number.

Adhering mostly to the Christ-
mas idea, this month's Panther
presents a number of extremely
laughable cartoons, short jokes and
skits. but there is no monotonous
repetition of stereotyped gags on
Christmas trees, mistletoe and
Santa. Clauses. Among other
timely features, an All-American
team dilferent from the others
leads the non-Christmas content.

Sixty District Schools Send
Cage Mentors to Annual
University A-Hair

-—.—_.

Tomorrow m01'ning’s session of the University’s third
annual basketball clinic will bring together more than 1,200
coaches representing Pcnns_vl.vania_, Ohio, and West Vir-
ginia to discuss problems arising from the rules changes,
argue offensive and defensive cage systems, and study has-
ketball manipulation during the morning and afternoon

session of the clinic. _
Began Three Years Ago V ]

Started three years ago as a temporary athletic gesture, when l
the football clinic branched out to include basketball as well, the;
clinic has increased to such proportions that the clinic has become
an annual ﬁxture at the University. ‘The first clinic in 1930 was
clearly a diagnostic study. It had as its primary motive the eleva-
tion of high school basketball playing to a more professional
standing and of closing the breech between the high school senior
and the college freshman. ‘- _

Comprising the first clinic at the University were 250 coaches.
selected for their keen interest in the game and the prominence;
of their teams in this branch of sport.

Develop Original Idea

The clinic sessions tomorrow will develop the purposes of the
first clinic, but it will follow a less scientiﬁc course. The same
coaches who were present in 1930 will again be in attendance at
tomorrow's sessions, but the clinic, instead of being a purely’ 10031
endeavor, will have representatives from Westmoreland, Washing-
ton, Greene, Fayette, Erie, Franklin, Lawrence, and Allegheny
counties in Pennsylvania, Parkersburg, Morgantown, and Wheel-
ing, in West Virginia, and Youngstown, Steulbenville, iVIart_1ns
Ferry, Bellaire, in Ohio. Among the colleges to be represented,
are Carnegie Tech, Duquesne, Thiel, VVaynesburg, Grove City, Al-
legheny, Westminster, Slippery Rock Teachers, California State
Teachers’ College, to mention only a few of the 60 schools to be
Dr. Carlson's guests.

The program of events is as follows:

Of course a lot of the old gang is here; the more they come the

And from further Nortli there is .lim Hyde ot' Frie East.
His football team beat Ashland, Kentucky, last fall. lt was the
:first time the latter had lost for five years. Still Mr. Hyde doesn't
lseem to think that he is too successful to quit learning.

state title is down front. somewhere, try to figure out what sort of
a jinx Carlson has on Stadsv-old of his own state.

“Pop” Warner comes back “home.”
Signing a contract Monday which
calls for a ﬁve-year coaching job at
Temple University in Philadelphia,’
coach Warner returns to the state that
is commonly linked with his rise to
“stardom,” so far as football coaching
is concerned, After a “leave of ab-
sence" for nine years, during which
time the “father” of the famous War-
ner system has been stationed at
Stanford University, This year on
its ﬁrst visit to the east during the
present football season, his Stanford
Cardinals were defeated by the Golden
Panthers at a game played on the
Stadium Field two weeks ago, 7-0.

Coached at Pitt "“

Warner has always had a. soft spot
in his heart for Pennsylvania, Dur-
ing his nine years at the Univer-sity,
and even before, when the “old fox”
was coaching at Cornell “Pop” had
a feeling that Pennsylvania was
“home” to him.

Temple’s standing in the football
world will be considerably enhanced
with the addition of Warner to its
coaching staff. He has had the habit
of placing teams under his wings, on
top of the football heap. That was
Pitt’s heritage: so it was with Stan-
ford; too, with Colgate before the-
days of Andy Kerr.

Rumors ﬂew wildly about with the
resignation of Warner from Stanford
University this week. It was read that
his assistants would be taken along
to Temple next year when he takes
up his coaching duties at Temple; it
was rumored that the freshman team
would pack, enmassee and follow the
genial leader to the east when he left.
It has since been rumored that “Tiny”
'1‘hornhi1l, a former Pitt graduate and
one of “Pop’s” assistants, would be
placed in charge of the Stanford
forces. The ﬁrst two rumors have
been since spiked, but Thornhill’s
elevation continues to gain in import.

Taught Many Stars

Warner coached at the University
from 1915 to 1922 when he was suc-I
ceeded by Dr. John Bain Sutherland,l
Pitt’s present mentor. During that
time Sutherland, Peck, Thornhill,
Carlson, De-Hart, McLaren, were pro-
teges of “Pop,” which probably ac-
counted for the fact that during his
nine years at Pitt, no defeats were
chalked up against him for three
years, 1915-17.

Reconstruct
Track House

Trackers To Get New Jumping
Pits, Traclt, and Lockers

After many years of a “hands-off”
policy, the athletic department of Pitt
has ﬁnally decided to correct the main
thorn in the tender sides of Panther
trackmen, the old track house

In past years, if one did not like the
appearance of a runner or jumper, or
a weight man, (although it is not
healthy to dislike a weight man), all
one had to do was mention. “track
house,” and the result would invari-
ably be a misshapen, quivering instru-
ment that once bore the title of track
man.

Sports writers, in particular, found
the old track house a. real comfort,
as the mere mention of it proved suf-
ﬁcient to disrupt any plans of vio-
lence in the minds of the trackers.
Alas, this method of control is to be
no more.

The track house, according to pres-
ent plans, will undergo a. thorough
period of reconstruction. The dirt
track, with its generous allowance of
ground glass and stones, is to be re-
placed with a dustless, smooth dirt
track that will not provide a knee and
ankle hazard,

In the middle of the building, a pit
for b.road jumpers, and one for pole
vaulters, will be constructed. Lead-
ing up- to both pits will be a clay track .
for running starts, A ﬁfty-yard
straightway track will be provided, ac-
cording to present plans, and the
turns will be banked for longer dis-
tances.

Heat, in no uncertain quantities,
will be provided for by the installation
of an immense stove. In addition, a

Resume oil Basket Ball Rule Changes

Marking the Court

line at mid-court. The bulletin makes
this arbitrary in various groups. Har-
monious co-operation will tend to
make playing conditions more uni-
form than heretofore.
The Ten Second Rule

After the preliminary confusion
passes this rule will not seem so revo-
lutionary. It will speed up the game.
The good teams will be better. The

team with continuity in its offense
will not be affected. Ten seconds is.
sometimes the difference between life
and death and may be a comparative-
ly long time. I feel that as long as
a team is making an honest effort to
get the ball across the line, they will
not be called for stalling. This will
ease the burden of the official.

The ﬁrst proposition is to get the
ball across the line. Failure to do so
is a violation with loss of ball.
Where?

the ball in olfensive territory.
four occasions that permit passing of,
the ball back over the mid line, (a)!
After shooting. (b) Out of bounds.

(c) Jump ball in offensive court or
on center tap. (d) Loss of control.
This last is not indicated in slight
touch by opponent. The illegal pass-
age of ball across the line is a viola-
tion. The whistle does not toot at in-
stant ball crosses the line. Unless
touched by teammate of violator the
whistle may not be blown. This
gives the opposition a chance to re-
cover the ball and continue play. If
the ball goes out of bounds the op-
ponent of the violator may choose to
take the ball out of bounds or at one
end of mid-line. I

The Pivot Play

The rule book says the pivot man

shall not withhold the ball from play

for more than three seconds. This

makes it an individual obligation and

gives more leeway than the latest bul-

letin of interpretation.

The ﬁnal interpretation says the

ball must be out of the foul lane

within three seconds. This obligates

not only the pivot man, but anyone

who may have received the ball with-

in the foul one from the pivot man.

This is the clause that really puts the

pivot play in precarious condition. It

is plain that the bal.l must be gotten

out of the foul line within three ‘sec-

onds. Touching any part of the lines

forming the foul zone automatically

Committee Needs Constructive
Criticism, Not Thoughtless
Opinions, Says Carlson

By Dr. H. C. Carlson

This recapitulation of the ba.sket-
ball rule changes reminds me of the
statement appended to many ﬁnan-
cial advertisements. This information
is gathered from reliable sources
which we consider authentic. I have
studied the rule book and the bulle-
tin’ on the latest interpr,etations.
There has been conversations and
personal interviews with various mem-
bers of the Rules Committee. Clinics
and games have been attended, to-
gether with exchange of ideas with
coaches, oﬁicials and players. I do
not try to project any personal aims.
These impressions reﬂect the honest
opinions of innumerable students of
the game. .

It is apropos that we again recall
that the Rules Committee receive
credit for intense, intelligent effort.

The Second D1'0D0Sm0T1 is to ke‘3plThey deserve constructive criticism,
The rather than hasty thoughtless opin-

ions, poorly expressed. If you have any
ideas we should write and rewrite
them. Try them on friendly critics,
to see if they get our ideas. Collabo-
rate with others, submit these efforts
to the Rules Committee and feel as-
sured of sympathetic’ intelligent re-
ception. Let us be constructive rath-
er than destructive.

The sensational football rule
changes went by, almost unnoticed.
We adapt ourselves easily and the
basketball changes will be readily
digested and assimilated. It is well

lto note that the rule book must be-
{supplemented by the contents of the

latest bulletin. This bulletin has
been given completely in this series.
It is likely that it would be publish-
ed in toto by any newspaper, if there
were sufficient requests.

places one within that zone.

The violation calls for loss of ball
to the opposition, out of bounds, on
the side, at the point nearest the spot
where the violation was committed.

Standing sidewise does not involve
the provisions of the pivot play.

Blocking and Screening

I see no change here. If a man
succeeds in getting into position to
screen, quickly enough to satisfy the
ofﬁcial, there is no blocking. This is
not deﬁned in the easiest manner by
indicating this priority of position by
both feet on the ﬂoor. Certainly either
a defensive or an offensive man is en-
titled to assume and keep any posi-
tion on the ﬂoor so long as he does not
actively interfere with an opponent.
The man who runs into a screener is
certainly charging and thereby com-
mits a foul. In the actual mechanics
of blocking offensively, if you get

there in time with both feet on the
ﬂoor, you screen, but ifyou move
into an opponent, it is blocking. If
both are moving and meet, the offi-
cial is supposed to favor the defense.
This will be compensated if the oili-
cial favors the offense, when the de-
fense is face guarding or blocking
defensively.

Face Guarding

The defense in disregarding the ball
and impeding the progress of an of-
fensive opponent is face guarding,
which is a phase of blocking. There
is no foul in assuming .a positio11.,;T.h,e,,
foul occurs when the ‘
shifts his position and impedes the
progress of the offensive man, while
disregarding the ball.

Numbers on Shirts

The new ruling requiring the same
number on front a.nd -back of shirts
facilitates oﬂiciating and reporting de-
tails. Six inches high, with material
one inch wide, no duplication of num-
bers, is a complete story.

Man Rushes Out of Bound

Barely touching a man is the spirit
of negligible contact. Any less is no
contact, any more is charging. The
habit of chesting an opponent with
hands and arms innocently extended
is 11ot prevalent and should be curbed.

After Foul Shot Missed

Vi/‘hen the foul shooter misses bas-
ket a11d bank board the ball is award-
ing to the opposition at that end of
the ﬂoor. Last year the award on the
{side of the ﬂoor baused some waste
got‘ time.

New Notes
i Accidental striking of foot or leg
‘by the ball is not a violation.

Vl/‘hen an injured man leaves the
game, an additional thirty seconds is
added to the regular one minute time
out.

In case of foul with ﬁeld goal ac-
lcompanied by question of timing, the
ﬁeld goal counts. The time of the
act of shooting is extended before
and after the actual shot. A player
prevented from taking a legitimate
shot by foul is now allowed to deﬁn-
itely shoot two foul trys.

Boxers Stage
Clinic Bouts

Frosh Mittmen Dominate.Group
Named For Demonstration

 

Freshman boxers will occupy the
center of interest tomorrow afternoon
when boxing coach Joe Orsini unveils
a pre-season review of the Pitt box-
ing team.

The bouts, which will start at 4:30
o’clock and continue for a period of
one hour, will show collegiate mitt-
men in practically every weight class,
The coaches that gather at the Sta-
dium pavillion will be treated to a
demonstration of the manly art on a
scale never before attempted by Pitt.

Three Round Bouts

The regulation boxing ring will be
-set up on the ﬂoor of the stadium
pavillion, and the bouts will consist
of three rounds each. The time of
"rounds has not yet been decided upon.
Each boxer will be handled by one or
two seconds. and extreme measures
have been taken to prevent injuries
of any kind. Mr. Schwartzkopf, of
the physical education department,
will oﬂiciate at the bouts.

As yet, no pairings have been deﬁ-
nitely made for the ﬁghts, Coach Or-
sini having decided not to announce
pairings until the time for the ﬁghts.
It is believed that this method will
prove much better than the previous
one ofzrannouncing pairings prema-
turely.

Fifteen boxers have been named by
Coach Orsini to take part in the
demonstration, and a larger list will
be announced later. Four of the fif-
teen are in the bantamweight, or 113-
pound class, and the remaining eleven
are scattered throughout the remain-
ing classes.

Fifteen Named

Charles Junge, Herbert Pearle, Rus-
sell Vogel, and Fabian Mihelic have
been named for the 115-pound class

bouts. Billy Evans, Abe Konick, Ber-
nard Speigel, Archie Heller, Joe
S‘-abino, George -Gambateese, John

Brailler, Charles Leape, Harry Rich-
‘ert, Clem Edgar, and William Schwim-
mer complete the list.

With but one or two exceptions, the
boxers who are to stage the demon-
strations tomorrow have never fought
before, and Coach Orsini is hopeful
that a short ﬁght before a. crowd will
do them a world of good. A total of
ﬁfteen hundred high school coaches
are expected to witness the bouts.

The addition of the boxing exhibi-
tions, in addition to the regular rou-
tine of basketball, will tend to make
the coaches’ stay at Pitt more en-
joyable. Although the boxers them-
selves have been handicapped with
lack of space, Coach Orsini is conﬁ-
dent that they will make creditable
showings.

Pitt Rifles Will Initiate
Six Men At Drill, Dec 17

“What is leather? What do you
rank? What time is it? All right for
the lights?”!!! And next week you
will see the pride and joy of Pitt’s
ROT-C humbling themselves to the

extent of answering these questions.

Today the following men will
be announced as initiates and
pl-edges o Pitt Riﬂes: R. H.

Jackson, Bu-s, Ad. ’33, Reg. Adjt.; J.
G. Conti, Col. ’34; Joseph Quashnock,
Col. ’35; H. O. Husband, Bus, Ad. ’35;
H. L. Smith, Bus. Ad. ’34; Jack VVyeth,
Col. '35. For the week beginning De-
-cember 12, ~ these men will parade
about and patrol the campus in the
regulation uniform, a. pledge insignia
of red, white, and blue, and in infer-
nal piece over their shoulder.

The initiation ceremonies are being
carried through by Lt. D. C. Treden-
nick and Thomas H. Savage, Col, '34,
secretary of the Rifles’. The formal
initiation of the pledges will be held
at the drill on December 17 at which
time the pledges will be made mem-
bers and given the official insignia,
the blue and gold fourragere. to wear.

Pitt-Georgetown Tilt Tomorrow
Night At Stadium Pavilion
Features Floor Clinic

Carlson's Eleventh Season

Ptt and Georgetown quintets will
open their Eastern Collegiate League
season tomorrow night on the Stadi-
um pavillion as the feature of the
third annual basketball clinic of Dr.
Clifford Carlson. Pitt will be start-
ing a twenty-two game schedule com-
prising many of the best college
ﬁves in the country.

The Panther starting lineup will
ﬁnd Captain Don Smith at forward‘
paired with Whitey Wilson. Claire
Cribbs of last year’s frosh team is now
the regular varsity center while
Charley Hughes and Don McCamant
are at the guard posts. Russel Och-
senhirt, center on last year’s varsity
was scheduled to start -at one of the
guards but will probably be kept out
of the game because of a recent ill-
ness.

Shifted to Forward

Captain Smith was a leading guard:
during the last two years, but has
been shifted to forward in order to
take better advantage of his fast drib-
bling and capable shooting.

Wilson led last year’s ﬁne fresh‘
quintet in scoring. He is a former
New Kensington High School star and
is expected to provide much of the
scoring punch of this year’s varsity.
Wilson seems to team well with
Smith.

Cribbs will probably be the player
to ﬁl1 Bus Albright's shoes at center.
He is six feet two inches tall and is
the most rugged man on the team, can
pass like a bullet and shoots with the
best of them.

Hughes and McCamant will make a
steady guard pair. Hughes is the
rugged type, continually mixing it up

on the ﬂoor while McCamant is
smoother, possibly more ﬂashy.
Last Year's -Center
Should Ochsenhirt get into the

game, the fans will see a player vast-
ly more at home than was “Dutch"
1-ast season. Guard is Russ’ natural
position.

Skip Hugh-es, Bogda, Kuno, Bond,
Wadsworth, Ames, and Brooks round
out a very reliable group of substi-
tutes. Most of them were members
of last year’s freshman team.

Carolan of Georgetown, was the
high scorer in last year’s Pitt-Hoya
game which the Hi1ltopper’s won by
a score of 33-30. He will be back in
the lineup tomorrow night and ad-
vance notices indicate that he will
probably again lead his team in scor-
ing. He is paired with Parcells an-
other excellent player at guard and to-
gether they provide a. big scoring
punch in addtion to taking care of
their defensive duties quite effec-
tively.

Connors at center is very tall and
slender, a fast dribbler and good de-
fensive man. Hangarder and Crowley
are the forwards for the visitors. Both
are good passers and shooters.

Carlson’s Eleventh Season

This season will be Dr. Carlson's
eleventh as Pitt’.-s basketball coach.
During this time his teams have Won
141 games and lost 60. Last season
was Carlson's worst as a Pitt mentor,
winning 14 and losing 16 in a schedule
that carried the Pitt ﬁve from coast
to coast extending over four months.

1927-28 were }"itt’s best years under

Carlson when with the great
“Charley” Hyatt, “Sykes” Reed,
“Stash” VVrob-leski, “Gyp” Wunder-

lich, and Paul Zehfuss in the lineup
the team was unbeaten in 21 starts.

During his connection with the
University since he was an under-
graduuate, Dr. Carlson was football
captain, freshman football coach, and
basketball coach and he has now
taken on the full time faculty job as
Head of the Student Health Service.
Assistant Coach George Kowallis is
clinical -assistant to Carlson at the
Health Service.

What About Education?

66‘vHAT are we going to do about it?” That well might be the
question in the mind of every University student today.

The announcement of Dean L. P. Sieg’s selection of a faculty
committee to investigate the aims and methods of teaching, with the
object in mind of creating “a new philosophy of education,” imme-
diately calls up the question for all of us: “VVhat are we going to
do about it?”

Let us stop for a moment of thought about ourselves. What——
in the name of all things sacred to our touted intelligence——have we
come to believe we are doing?

The value of thisthing so pleasantly identiﬁed for consumption
as a “college education”—this thing we have come to look upon as
a kind of necessary interlude in our lives—no longer can be meas-
ured by the accepted standards of dollars and cents. Mass education
and the subsequent rise of a new class of pseudo-intellectuals have
changed all that. Education no longer carries the guarantee of a
job. And yet we continue to regard its acquisition as a kind of
“business.” That, in effect, has been the “philosophy” of educa-
tion for most of us.

Educators the world over continue to ask, “What is it all
about?” Educators like Dean Sieg and the men he has asked for a
solution to that disturbing question are displaying more concern over
the problem than the students themselves. VVe follow the way of
routine, patterned preparation as the easier of the two paths to un-
derstanding. VVe “follow,” half hoping, not even conﬁdent of our
own deliberate choice, hardly bothering to wonder about the things
we pass on the way.

Dean Sieg has said, “I do not want a plan; I want a philosophy
of education and the energy and courage to carry that philosophy
into effect. The way of education is not important, but the funda-
mental philosophy underlying it all is absolutely necessary.”

As part of the proposed philosophy, he has suggested: ﬁrst, that
the student will retain and make a permanent part of his own life
only those matters which have been made real through some act of
creation on his own part; and second, that no education has any
permanent value whatsoever unless the student takes an active, not
a passive, part in its acquisition. .

Therein lies the challenge. We who “follow,” we who take the
passive part in the thing which concerns us_more than it does any
body of perfect teachers, should have something to say. .

The creation or the discovery of a new philosophy of education
is our problem. What are we going to do about it?

A Campus Thieves Again

THE house members of ﬁfteen campus fraternities awoke Wednes-
day morning to discover themselves the victims of roving ma-
rauders who had stolen.no less than ﬁfteen bronze door placques
from the fraternity portals. _
With no deﬁnite clues as to the identities of the destructive
thieves, the rightfully irate brethren have had to content themselves
with superﬁcial reports to the city police and the ofﬁce of the dean
of men. But in spite of the carefully executed plans of the vandals,
common sense and some knowledge of previous cases suggest that
the incident was one carried out by none other than students. .
The placques range in value from ﬁfteen to ﬁfty dollars; their
value to the individual fraternities, however, is immeasurably more,
and for less quantitative reasons. Inquiry in the past two days has
revealed that a net sum of ﬁve cents per pound is paid for placques
when melted down for recasting. The slight return for anyone de-
siring to run the risk of such thievery, and the fact that fraternity
name placques might very easily be traced, almost removes from
suspicion the average hoodlum-thief. . _
Such acts of vandalism need occur only once in the proverbial
“blue moon” to thoroughly disgust us with the type of collegian ap-
parently responsible for this outrage, a student type whose only
claims to manhood are contained in his erect posture and.power of
mobility. That his actions should be taken as representative of the
two student bodies in the Oakland district is greatly to be regretted.
To clear the student body of its implied connection with the
theft, Interfraternity Council and the office of the dean of men
should press their investigation to the utmost, with the ob3ect_of
settling for once and all the standards of right and wrong by which
“privileged” collegians are to be judged.

Welcome, Coaches

NOTHER YEAR, and the time approaches for another of Dr.
Carlson’s basketball clinics. Begun three years ago as a tem-
porary athletic development for a selected group of invited coaches
in the Pittsburgh district, it has now become a permanent ﬁxture to
which more than 1,200 coaches and players from three states will
attend tomorrow to argue the merits of the 1932 rules changes, study
present day offensive and defensive play formations, and discuss
problems relative to the coaching profession or game oiﬁciating.

The clay of the individual high school team that scheduled a
series of games with its nearby school opponents, is gone. With the
rise of high school leagues of which the W. P. I. A.  and P. I. A. 
are notable examples, the need for a cohesive high school unit,
grounded properly in the fundamentals of team play and with expe-
rience needed for strenuous league competition, has been seen by
high schools. The University basketball clinic furnishes the back-
ground for that study.

Dr. Carlson and the University are to be congratulated in pro-
viding such a “school” for coaches and players. So we welcome the
1,200 “students” who will attend “classes” tomorrow in the Sta-
dium pavilion; we hope that their “study” may be useful in pro-
viding more interesting as well as more equal competitive playing in
school leagues and out of them.

How few are the musical composi-
tions a student can name when ra.nked
with the numerous poems he can
quote? But the fault is not his. It
lies, rather, in the inadequacies of any
organized program of musical educa-
tion. A person can gain little appre-
ciation of poetry by having Milton
droned at him daily unless he has
some conception of other poetic forms
and of the workings of the art itself.
In the same manner, learning to ap-
preciate good music by hearing a
Brahms symphony‘ once or twice a
month, between stretches of jazz, is
a slow, unsatisfactory process.

But programs for musical education
are under way in several quarters.
In our University, the Pittsburgh Mu-
sical Institute has been meeting the
need for some time with recitals di-
rected toward demonstrating the chief
musical forms, with relation to devel-
opment and orchestration. Vocal solo
and chorus work is also included, and
one -can always be certain of hearing
some of the best music in the_ city.

' A Study In Orchestration

The Afternoon Symphony Concerts
a.t -Carnegie Hall are the most am-
bitious offers. The ﬁrst of these is
to be given this Wednesday afternoon,
at 4:30 o’clock, by the Detroit Orches-
tra under the direction of Victor
Kolar, The entire program is cen-
tered on the evolution of the orches-
tra, demonstrated by works from the
great composers. A Bach Minuet
comes ﬁrst. This is followed by the
Allegro from the G Minor Symphony
of Mozart and by the Andante from
Beethoven’s great Fifth, thus showing
symphonic orchestration at its height.
The last two numbers, Berlioz’s
Rakoczy March from The Damnation
of Faust, and Haneg{;er’s orchestra}
movement, Pacific>—231, will show the
modern trends in orchestration. For
its sort, no ﬁner opportunity will be
found in the city. For students who
can show registration cards the rates
are only twenty-ﬁve cents.

The most signiﬁcant exhibition of
the younger group to appear yet is
the work of nine artists showing on
the ﬁrst floor of the Union Trust
Building. The exhibition is directed
by Charles E. McCurdy and is unusual
for its soundness and the superior
qualities of each artist. Richard Crist
achieves a particularly ﬁne work in
his Portrait of a Woman, and a single
lithograph of his shows a remarkable
amount of force.

The portraits were distinctive all
the way through, especially the two
of McCurdy which achieve the fresh-
ness of color and the light handling
comparable to his landscapes. Both
Marcelle Comes and Louise Pershing
exhibit work in keeping with their
reputations, though it seems Margaret
Ruse’s watercolor scarcely shows the
breadth and richness of much of her
other work. Charles W. Brown, an
international exhibitor, has two in-
teresting watercolors on canvas. The
other exhibitors are Raymond Baxter
Dowden, Virginia I. Cutlibert, and J.
Wesley Snyder. The show will hang
two weeks and certainly should not
be missed, since it affords an excel-
lent opportunity for seeing some of
the better work being done by younger
artists.

 

Council Praises

Band Showing
At Assembly

The band comes into the lime-
light once again for its aid and
assistance towards furthering
school spirit. Student Council
recognizes the ﬁne spirit of the
band, as is shown in the follow-
ing letter to Col. E. J. Cullen:

“In behalf of the University of
Pittsburgh as a whole, Student
Council would like to express to
you and to the ROTC its sincere
thanks for your cooperation in
making the testimonial Assembly
a success.

The student body, led by the
ROTC, rallied to the support of
this project with a school spirit
seldom equalled before, making
the Assembly an event of which
the University and our coach,
Jock Sutherland, may well be
proud.

We are very grateful to you for
your large part in this splendid
tribute to Dr. Sutherland.”

To the Editor, Pitt News:

Again the Pitt News has given
currency to a question of vital
importance to the Univer‘s‘ity. The '
suggestion regarding the appoint-
ment of a Dean of Men is ap-
proved by every right thinking
man on the campus. Pitt should
have a Dean of Men.

Personally I thing a Dean of
Men should be chosen from among
those who have had experience

 with students in the classroom.
‘This ‘lays the foundation for a
broader and deeper understand-

» ing of student needs. For this
reason I concur with those who
advocate the appointment of Dr.
Robert L. Jones.

But; whether We get a Dean of
Men or not the Pitt News has
again demonstrated its thorough
understanding of the wish and
the need of the student body.

NICHOLAS STEPANOVICH.

To the Editor, Pitt News:

VVe should like to commend the
Pitt News in the highest terms
for the service rendered the Uni-
versity for raising the question
of the appontment of a Dean of
Men. ,

To us it seems that the men
students are entitled to the priv-
ilege of a wise and. understand-
ing councilor. They are entitled
to the services of some one whose
duty it is to look after their wel-
fare. There are a number of
special phases of student life ade-
quately provided for but there is
no one to correlate the whole.
There is no one, and there can
be no one to promote the collec-
tive activity of men students until
a Dean is appointed.

The present arrangement is
fairly satisfactory but no tem-
porary expedient can ever fully
meet the needs of the Univer-
sity. And to us it seems that a
Dean of Men was never needed
so badly as in a time like the
present. Therefore, we most
heartily endorse the suggestion
contained in the last issue of the
News suggesting Dr. Robert 3L.
Jones be appointed to this place.
His broad and deep learning, his
sympathetic understanding of
human nature ﬁt him perfectly for
the task.

Very truly yours,
LOUIS BERMAN, Col. ’35.

FACULTY ANNOUNCEMENTS

and Thursdays.

By Sam Honigberg _

We had a merry time at the tiny Falk Elementary School Audi-
torium Tuesday night. With Director Carl B. Cass a mereonlooker,
a dozen of his disciples took things much to their own liking and
produced a group of three one-act plays. _
And an entertaining group they were. It started off with Flor-
ence Ryerson’s comedy-clrama, “Third Angle,” continued on its way
with George Middletoii’s dramatic inkling, “Tradition,” and ended
the evening with Babatte Hughes'¢

laugh-packed comedy “One Egg.”
Bob Mcclurkin Directs

Robert Mcclurkin, Professor Ralph
E. Turner’s right hand man in read-
ing and grading history assignments,
turned director long enough to make
"Third Angle” an effective little play-
let, The story deals with the famous
angle that comes to make up the
eternal triangle. In this case it is
about an artist who can't forget his
feminine subjects after he has painted
them. His wife, however, sees that
everything will turn out all right at
the end. Marquis Patterson, in the
part of the artist, and Dorothy Kauf-
man, in the part of the wife, emote
long enough to make their parts real-
istic, while Helen Milliron does the
best she can in portraying the “other
woman.”

“Tradition” in Costume

Mildred Soyak directed “Tradition,”
a story in costume that reminds One
of the “hiss the villain” days.
Strangely, there is no villain in this
case, There is a stage-struck girl,
though, who is misunderstood by her
father, Winston McConkey, as the
father, stands ﬁrst in the rating of
the acting honors. He made his part
convincing and thoroughly interesting.

Wonnetah Parks and Harriet Sloan.
in the parts of wife and daughter re-
spectively, lend able support.
“One Egg” Funny

The surprise of the evening came
with the presentation of the uproari-
ous little comedy “One Egg,” under
the direction of Eunice L. l\'ICClu1‘l(in.

It is a, fluffy little idea that deals with -

a waiter who was instructed not to
serve one egg- TWO 6888. Yes; but
never one. Louis Reizenstein as the
frozen-faced waiter offers plenty of
laughs, There are times when he re-
minds one of Buster Keaton, portray-
ing his part in a similar manner.
Fred Kiger, as the boy, and Frieda
Gomstein, as the girl, played satis-
factorily other Darts of the D133’ that
proved the most amusing of all three.

may not know deﬁnitely that he is

going to return for the second semes-
ter, he will be expected to register
during this early period.”

The purpose of the early registra-
tion plan in general is to facilitate
the process of enrolling students in
the short period between semesters
by reducing the congestion and con-
fusion so common under the system
followed previous to last year.

Every attempt will be made by the
departmental offices to help students
in the selection of the particular
courses necessary to satisfy their uii-

dergraduate requirements, Registrar
Quick pointed out.
“In instances where changes of

courses or sections are found neces-
sary,” he said, “the departmental of-
iices will, to a limited extent, permit
legitimate transfers, and everything
possible will be done to the end that
all qualiﬁed students may ﬁnish the:
details of registration before the close
of: the ﬁrst semester.”
Holiday Advantage

Thus, all who take advantage of the
early registration, the registrar ex-
plained, may enjoy the between-
semesters holiday that will extend
from the ‘close of examinations to
Wednesday, February 8, the day
classes begin for the second semester.

Opportunity for payment of the sec-
ond semester tuition during the early
registration period will be provided
all students, sothat every detail in
the enrollment procedure may be
completed during the advanced period.

The further suggestion was made
by Registrar Quick that unless regis-
tration is completed during the early
period, a student cannot be sure he
will be reassigned to the sections to
whicr he is now reporting. Registra-
tion during the ﬁrst few days of the
period is urged for those who, for spe-
cial reasons, may desire particular

sections.

Uommiffee Members Ready

To

 

 Colfegc Ideal

 

Prior to the ﬁrst meeting of Dean
Lee Paul Sieg’s committee of profes-
sors which will attempt to discover
or create a new and vital philosophy
of education a few of the members of
the committee have expressed what
they hope the committee will be able
to accomplish. For the most part
the committee members looked for-
ward to evolving a workable scheme,
but admitted that it will probably be
a long time before anything deﬁnite is
shaped by the committee.

Dr. Omar C. Held, assistant profes-
sor of psychology and personnel direc-
tor of the College, saw the matter
along three lines of attack. “What are
the objectives of a college,’’ is the
ﬁrst problem. Secondly, if we agree
on the objective, “can we obtain them
with our present curriculium,” and
last, “is there any way of settling up-
on a proper curriculum.”

Dr. Held said, “People felt certain
of themselves a few years ago. It is
now necessary to re-examine funda-
mental assumptions in education as
in other things.” He further stated
that probably the best place from
which this philosophy of education
could evolve is from the students
themselves.

Dr. John VVilliam Oliver, professor
and head of the history department,
writes thusly about his philosophy of
education: “My philosopliy——I prefer
to call it an aim-—is to provide for
the student an opportunity to go as
far as he possibly can in that ﬁeld
of work that he likes best. I care
not what his interest may be. At
some time in each person’s life, one
ﬁnds a real joy, a thrill in doing
something, in discovering something,
that pleases him more than anything
else that he ever did. That exalta-
tion that comes from sheer joy of do-
ing the tliing that he likes to do, and
can do successfully, should be con-
tinued or sustained: exaltatioii. And
the College should make it possible
for that student to go to the very

“Craig’s Wife,” popular with Amer-
ican audiences since its ﬁrst perform-
ance in New York in 1925, is an in-
trospective domestic tragedy that ap-
peals both to the intelligence and to
the emotions. The campus perform-
ance is scheduled for February 16,

Pitlzin Club Holds Last

Christmas party.

limit of his ability in pursuing his-
desired study.

“I would not prescribe a set course‘
of study for any student. Rather, I
would suggest to him what other peo-
ple have done in this particular ﬁeld.
I would point him to the literature‘
and history bearing upon th-e subject,
and then, more important still, I would
suggest to him that lie try to go one‘
step further than anyone else has-
ever gone. If we succeed in this, we
will be rendering a real service.”

Quoting from his article in the‘
Pittsburgh Record of December and
January, 1931-32, Dr. Robert T.
Hance, professor and head of the de-
partment of zoology, said “Our train-
ing must be planned, not for a chosen-
few, but for the n-eeds of the race.
Since needs and temperaments and
abilities vary, our training programs
cannot afford to be too dogmatic an-dz
larbitrary if we expect them to meet
changing requirements.” I

In his article Dr. Hance presents the
conclusion of the faculty group which
studied the aim of a college of liberal
arts a few years ago. Two excerpts-
from the report ﬁx the aims of the
College: “The college is concerned-
with the knowledge and with the"
ideals and with the creative activity
that make up mental and spiritual”:
life.——If in the en-dr we are successful
in giving the students a balanced out-
look on the experiences of man, we
shall have gone a long way toward-
making him react to his surroundings
cf the future with the common sense,
tolerance, and sportsmanship that are’
the hallmark of education.”

Dr. Mont R. Gabbert, professor and
head of the department of philosophy‘
and chairman of Dean Sieg’s commit-
tee, in-dicated yesterday that the va-
rious members of the committee have‘
been discussing their work in informal-
groups and that the meeting would
probably see some deﬁnite steps to-
ward coalescing the various ideas into
a workable philosophy.

liver the last of his series of lectures
on “Toward an Understanding of
Jesus.”

Arthur Charleswortli, Col. ’33, pres-
ident of the Pitkin Club, has made a
special request that each member
bring a small present suitable for a.«
child from six to twelve years old to
today's meeting. The gifts will be sent
to the Charlottesville, Kentucky
School for Children conducted by the
home missions of the Presbyterian
Church.
