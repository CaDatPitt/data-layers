room was well ﬁlled with members
and admirers of the "popular profes-
sor.»  --

l'_)r. Thorpe’s topic was handled in
his own characteristic-it‘-ashion, and

was not, as the title might indicate, a’

chronological _record of the course of
the Christian religion.‘ It was rather
a deﬁIlLit'ion.r “Christianity cannot be
judged,” he said, “by any of the world-
tried standards of success. It has con-
tributed nothing to the art, architec-
ture, literature’ or material wealth of
the world. _It has not availed to pre-
vent the European carnage, because
it has never been tried. It is an indi-
vidual thing, the relation between one
man and his God and his fellow-man.
‘It is the history of the human spirit,

the part of man. which survives all

else. If any other religion could do
as much for the human’ spirit, we
would accept it.” - ~

-more equally distributed, L
comlmeissiont was ﬁrst. suggested by the
. real estate board to afford somerelief

‘PITT V31-—T-STATE 28
The army of invasion, led by Coach
fit, was successful in winning the
urn .game at State College last Fri-
_,VVTyVevVening as they were in admin-
Ttering the ﬁrst defeat to the Nittany
iiintet that they have met in their
 cage this year by the marginal of
-*-—-28. 1 .
 The game was a_ most desperately
ontested one ‘throughout. First the
=a_teT5 men would secure the lead and
 lose it before some determined
ad. V.‘»bV1%illliant assault from the Pirtt
Tazchine. TFin'a1ly in the last few sec-
rls of play, when the two teams were
nning . neck to neck on the. home
etch, V‘McNultyV tore loose from his

rding man and went up the ﬂoor

Vkemad man to cage" the ball for a
we point gain. In . -the next scrim-
agerhe duplicated the performance,
ereby giving the Blue and Gold ex-
nents -a clear lead over the Center
untians. 1 V . l A ' T
During the ﬁrst half, the State _ de-
ense was asbafﬂing as of old to the
‘ Tjing ﬁve, but in the ﬁnal stage the
 iﬁc pounding ‘of Lu1bic-Hastings
T‘ e1VNultTy and Co- began to have ateli-
g effect on the stability ofVth‘e Blue
White defense and eventually so

eakened it that McNulty was en-

lbled to tear loose for his sensational
 in the ﬁnal moments of play.
For the State aggregation Blakeslee
nd Walten played a game of premier
uality, and it was their efforts that
went far toward, creating a defense
f "the" genuine State defense.

      JUNIATA 35--PITT 42  

The Blue and Gold" basket ball team
considerably strengthened their al-
ready formidable claim to the State
championship honors . when , they
downed the Juniata ﬁve at Hunting-
don last Saturday evening by a score
of 43-~35.  T T _ T

The VJuniata. men had tasted defeat
at the hands of the Pitt men in their
sally from Huntingdon earlier in the
year and they were anxious to turn
the trick on. the Lubic cohorts when
they visited the Juniata cage. But
though the critics estimated that the
Easternersg played by far the best
game of the season they were unable

opponents,

TheVlTga>‘n1eT was  ‘close one 
the ﬁrst half, which ended with WPitt

lonel*poiVn'tV on velvet, During“the' 

ond; period, however, the score was
tied several times and toward;th‘e end
of the galmeitk began to look as though
the Juniata men‘ had a ochancei to

score -their revenge. In  the V ‘ﬁnal;
stages, MTcMaster, who had shot bas-T “

ketslike a ﬁendduring the ﬁrst half
recovered his poise and inaugurated
a.nVot.he~r.V whirlwind attack in which he
was given ample support by his com-T
rades. So eminently successful was
he that when the game» ended the
Blue and Gold ledger column -footed
up a neat ten point lead. T ‘ 1

[During the entire season the Pitt
team has been playing remarkable
basket ball that oftenbroke into the

son’s brilliant work at _Lafayette or
Matson’s commendable performance
‘at Rutgers cannot be overlooked but
for pure .superlum¢inaryT effort and
achievement the accomplishment of.
M_lcMaster at Juniata cannot be well
