the
University will recess on Elec-

I-“fttion Day (November 3) and the

-preceding day. The pattern is to
be permanent and will apply to
every general and primary elec-

_ tion. Its purpose is to afford stu-
dents a chance to give politick-

‘ ing aitry.

Because the recess will be
both brief and late, it has been
dismissed by skeptics as a pro-

S System symbol of minimal po-

tential. Pessimists contend that
_‘students will use the recess to

' ‘catch up on schoolwork or treat
 it as a mid-term vacation.

like to participate in a political
campaign that they will at least
get their feet wet. Moreover.
they claim that the slaying of
four Kent State students by Ohio
National Guardsmen May 4 and
two Jackson State students by
police May 14 politicized a broad
spectrum of undergraduates.

In conjunction with the recess,
the Senate established a Citizen-
ship Information Center (CIC),
which will provide members of
the University community with
information on candidates for
federal, state‘ and local offices._

The CIC. expected to open
soon. will be in close contact
with various campaign headquar-
ters and will be able to tell stu-
dents which candidates are an-
xious for their help. The CIC
will also be prepared to steer
students towards candidates whose
views are similar to their own

Chancellor Wesley Posvar af-

‘ “firmed that the University must

become a_ personal and relevant
-place before it can fulfill the
needs of its students - -

Speaking before 2000 freshmen
Assembly

is the largest freshmen class in
the University’s history; 46 per-
cent of the class are women;
over half of the class has come
' from families in which the par-

,. \ ents have not attended a college
 - or university; and the Scholastic

Aptitude (S.A.T.) scores of the
freshmen are in the high 500’s. 

’ ’X‘He' also discussed the changing
’ face of the campus, such as the

cornpletion of chemistry and en-

”. gineering buildings on the upper

portion of the -campus, and the
Forbes Field complex which will

.K-__: . -be completed in the near future.

“The city and the campus can-

 not be separated,” Dr. Posvar
 said, “and Pitt is vitally concern-

ed about the problems of urban

living.”

Dr. Posvar believes that the
University can and will do more
to solve these pressing problems
and create a better environment
for both the members of the Uni-
._versity and city community to
live in.

He went on to explain that stu-

 ‘ “dents must make the University
* adaptable to their needs so that

itwill become a personal place.
instead of a mere mass of con-
crete. - -

._ Students;-who now occupy 60
seats in the University Senate,

have much more power in govern-
ing the University, Posvarclaim-,
ed. However, this greater student
authori_ty’will be wasted, he said,
unless members of the University
community take advantage of
the opportunity and take the time
to become involved.

Dr. Posvar ended his address
by encouraging the freshmen
with the knowledge that probab-
ly two-thirds of them will attend
a graduate school.

The next speaker took\a differ-
ent tack.

"I must part company with
those critics who say ‘that be-
cause students don't behave. or
don't cut their hair. or think like

they do — these students ‘have,

given up on our country, have
lost faith in it. On the contrary, I
believe they are trying to find
our country once again — as it
was originally designed to be."

With these .words,' Dr. Charles
Montgomery, the new Dean of
Student Development, expressed
his confidence in America’s
yout-h.

“Despite a decade of campus un-
Test’; enrollment figures one col-
leges and universities continue

-to go upward. What does this
mean? I prefer it to mean that -

we are here — and millions of
other students. staff and faculty
are on college campuses across
the nation because we choose to
be where the action is." Dr.
Montgomery said.

Lenny Klavonic. President of
Student Government. discussed
the inner feelings of the college
student towards his fellow hum-
an being.

   

mal provisions for intensive stu-
dent politicking in October. it
did suggest that highly motivat-
ed students arrange with their
professors to make up academic
work missed as a result of extra
ordinary political activity.

Among the candidates most
likely to receive massive student‘

' support this fall is Douglas Wal-

gren, a 29 year old Mount Leb-
anon Democrat. who is oppos-
ing veteran Republican Con-
gressman James Fulton. 67. of the
27th Congressional District. which
includes South Hills townships
and the South Side wards. ‘

Walgren, who intends to link
Fulton to the Nixon administra-
tion’s economic policies and the
war in Vietnam, has already en-
listed the support of several doz-
en students from Carnegie-Mell-
on University (CMU).

“A college education must be

Senate Minority Leader Hugh
Scott might normally be expected
to draw considerable flak from
anti-war students who resent his
devotion to President Nixon.
However. he appears unbeatable
and is opposed by State Senator
of Erie. who
trounced dove Norval Reece in
the Democratic primary. despite
a concerted effort on Pittsburgh
and Philadelphia campuses to
elect Reece.

Congressman "William Moor-
head. who represents Oakland.

is a staunch critic of the war and
excessive military spending. He
could muster campus help but
faces only token opposition in
Republican Barry Levine.

Because the University’s finan-
cial status depends on decisions
made by the State Legislature,
students may work for Harris-
burg legislators who have cham-

pioned the cause‘ of higher edu-.

cation in Pennsylvania, such as
State Representative Gerals Kauf-
man of Squirrel Hill.

Whatever students do. they are
likely to be closely watched by
Pittsburgh’s Student Majority.-

I miolvement Limited

‘ By a IRS   Guidelines

by BILL GORMLEY
News Editor

The« Internal Revenue Ser-
vice (IRS), once villainous
only to American taxpayers,-
now has enemies on college
campuses across the nation.

On June 19, the IRS approved

' guidelines which‘ require univer-

sities to refrain not only from
direct involvement in political
campaigns but also from finan-
cing student organizations which
attempt to influence elections
or carry a political message to
Middle America in ways not
clearly defined. The guidelines
were suggested by the American
Council on Education, located in
Washington, D.C. -

.. Tax-Exempt Status at Stake

-Should Ja' university fail to
meet the standards established

by the IRS, it could lose its tax-

exempt status. Consequently, col-
lege administrators are taking
the guidelines very seriously.

Because the wording of the
IRS ruling is obscure, even legal
experts are confused and unable
to decide conclusively what is
permissible and what is not. As
a result of the imprecise lang-
uage. college administrators are

finding themselves forced to in-

terpret the ruling and hope for
the best.

At Pitt. the administration has
adopted a noncommital. wait-and-
see attitude. treating the ruling
like ‘a hot potato. University
Counsel. James Wolf. revealed
this when he spoke for the ad-
ministration to the Pitt News.

“We‘ll answer questions that
arise as they do arise in terms of
the activities that may be propos-
ed.“ he commented. .

Although the impact of the,
IRS guidelines can’t be gauged»
yet, the ruling may very well
throw a damper on student poli-
ticking this fall and in years to
come. For this reason, many stu-
dents who believe in working
within the system to effect social
change are dismayed. They were
hoping that a record number of
undergraduates would try to in-
fluence this year’s elections.
Their optimism has ebbed.

The IRS guidelines make the
following stipulations:

1) Partisan political organiza-
tions, including the traditional
Young Democrat and Young Re-
publican "clubs. are --to receive
university funds only if their ac-
tivities are substantially geared
to the university community.
“To the extent that such organ-
izations extend their activities
beyond the-campus. and inter-
vene or participate ‘in campaigns
on behalf of candidates for pub-
lic office." the rulinggstatesf ‘fan

' -_in'st_itut‘ion should _in7 good;‘fa_ith
. m ...eil'_  . .

per»a’n_d ap_.-;g.

\ collected for all facilities and

services provided.”

2) Such organizations must re-
imburse the university if they
"permit non-members"e£.. he uni-
versity community to ava 1 them-
selves of university facilitiesior
services.“ 

3) A university may declare a
recess to permit studentsto be
politically active. but only if
time is made up by a calendar
extension. “The mere rearrange-
ment of an academic calendar
for the purpose of permitting
students, faculty and other mem-
bers of the academic‘ community
to participate in the election
process" is allowed if “the re-
cess period is in fact a substi-
tute for another period which
would have been free of
ricular activity." If. on the other
hand. the calendar “is shortened
rather than rearranged . . . the
question might be raised wheth-
er releasing faculty and staff
members from normal duties.
with pay. to participate in the
process represents an indirect

-participation by the institution

itself in a political campaign on

behalf of a candidate for public
office." A g ..

Pitt Recess Legal A V

The third provision ‘will. not

affect Pitt, where a two-day re-

cess will be complemented by‘

two class days not scheduled pre-

viously. It will, however, force ,

Princeton University. to revise

-plans for a two week election re-

cess without make-up provisions:
and prevent Chatham College
from instituting a similar ten
day recess.

The first "two rulings could
have an immediate impact here.
If Young Democrats and Young

Republicans use office telephones
to solicit support for candidates

or print campaign literature at I

the University‘s expense, they
may run the risk of losing the
money they now receive — a share
of the student activities fee.

Also. partially because of the
new complications. no'students

ROTC Head

Watliins Analyzes Role

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

A University alumnus has re-
turned here to boost the caliber
of the United States Air Force.

Although he is convinced that
working in a college is not con-
ducive to job opportunities and
promotions. Colonel Jack Wat-
kins, head of the Reserve Offi-
cers Training Corps (ROTC) on
campus. feels that the govern-
ment has been overlooking the
manpower potential in institu-
tions of higher education.

“It’s time for people with ex-
perience and motivation to come
to the college campuses," he
said. "The Armed Forces have
always put their best men in
Southeast Asia and the Penta-
gon.“

SECURITY REASONS

Claiming that he is motivated
by an “overriding sense of re-
sponsibility for the security of
this country”, Watkins defines
his “secondary” priorities as
“flying airplanes, and working
with men.”

Watkins came to the Univer-
sity after the ROTC programs
lfia'd been stripped of credit by

{he faculty last year. He consid-up

ers the controversy concerning
the place of the military on the
campus "the secret of democ-
racy". '

"The democratic system may
move two steps backward at
times. but it always moves three
steps forward, always progress-
ing," he believes. He blames the
overemphasis on the military as-
pect on a societal consensus.

“Society as a whole allowed
this to happen and society as a
whole will have to change it."
he said. He does not foresee a
radical shift in the near future.

YOUTH POWER

the impetus of “young people in
the country”. “It is up to us to
do what we are doing in this
country, to set our own goals.
Majority rule runs the U.S. If it
takes young people to change the
goals, then they will do it,” he
continued.

Watkins is sure that the govern-
ment will “respond“ to the young.

As a representative of the
“Military-Industrial Complex”.
the Colonel finds himself con-
fronted with the debate surround-
ing the wars in Indochina. He
refers to “the need for security"
as a justification.

He fears that “we cannot lose
more and more portions of the
world in today’s more and more

sophisticated world”. In response
to a question concerning US
“ownership of Southeast Asia”,
the Colonel rescinded his state-
ment, relying instead on his ver-
sion of the Domino Theory;

WELL, ALRIGHT

“Alright, it's not ours to lose.“
he said. “What I'm really talk-
ing about is influence. The na-
tions there will be influenced
the most by whoever will be the
victor.“

Watkins, however, sees no re-
lationship between US “imper-

ialism“ in Southeast Asia and its-

adherence to the Monroe Doc-
trine concept dealing with the
Latin American nations.

“The Monroe Doctrine was
designed to permit the South
American nations to develop
without outside interference.
But weaponry was not sophisti-
cated then. Communications and
the psychology of nations have
changed.”

He feels that provisions are
needed to provide for the secur-
ity of all the nations of the world‘
and considers ' the United Na-
tions best fit for that role;

NOT YET READY

At the present time, however".
Watkins has concluded that “the
emerging nations of -the world
have not progressed to the point
where they can do their own
thing."

In any case, the Colonel reit-
erated that “a consenus of the

   

Decorative

people in this country is neces-
sary to indicate to our represen-
tatives whether or not it is nec-
essary to assist these people."

Pragmatically, he feels, chan-
ges depend on majority opinion.
Since he is convinced that the
“biggest thing happening now is
on the college campuses”, he
highlights the role of students.

“The young people are influ-
encing every segment of society.“
Watkins said. “It's the same for
the Armed Forces. We need good
men. Not cast—offs who can‘t

Remember? Remember May 4 and May . 14, 1970?
Well, do the words Kent and Jackson State mean anything
to you? Do you remember your feelings when you saw

those pictures of students just like yourself lying in pools.
 of their own blood on the Kent State University campus,
or what you said when you found out the two brothers had

been ripped off at Jackson State?
‘\ And now think, just a bit.‘Has it occurred to you that

you are also a student on a large college campus? Have _

you noticed that a lot of the things that lead to the Kent
and Jackson demonstrations in the first place are inherent in
your surroundings too?

It is not -reasonable to assume that the things which
caused the Jackson and Kent State tragedies were only ger-
maine to those two campuses and no other. Pitt also has
people who are tired of -demonstrating in the accepted
fashion, who are tired of war, who can’t communicate and
don’t even see any reason in trying any more; who know
the little subleties of oppression and racism; and who are
so frustrated- that they feel as though they may explode;
and then too, Pitt has those who will become like this. '

So, what does this all mean? Basically that the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh and. its ‘students, administration, and
community or not so far away from those in Ohio or Mis-
sissippi. '

Any student who would mouth the words, “It couldn’t
happen here,” is either completely devoid of common sense
or a hermit. (It’s only in the true lessons which we can
garner from the tragedies, which will enable us to know.)

Some say we should look at the six student’s death as a
reminder that you don’t flaunt, the law or your country,
without paying for it. What we should really see is that we
are living in a sick society,'where bad laws and policies are
justice, and that everyone’s actionslare really reactions-
terror-stricken reactions.

So what are we going to do now? “No one wants any-
one else to die,” seems to typify the new rationals taking
over a lot of minds now, “why don’t we sort of drop the
subject of changing the system we live under for now.” ’

But this can’t be. Those six students are dead. And they
are dead because of the movement that we have started.
They are dead because young people in this country have
been awakened to the realities of it, and do not like what
they see. Two blacks and four whites had their bodies in-
vaded by metal because we once thought enough about our
country that weset out to keep it from becoming the mon-
ster which-we saw it is becoming. -

Yet, because of their deaths, we falter. We slow down;
relying on occasional token actions to ease. our consciences
about their deaths, but that is all.

“Wasn’t that a shame about those four kids at Kent
State?” “Yeh man, those damn cops really messed over our

’ brothers down at Jackson, didn’t they?”

They’re interesting conversational statements. I wouldn’t
doubt that they are said with sincerity and true concern,
but they are only conversational pieces. And the incidents

t are so irregularly discussed that the subject usually flees by.

Bad memories—A nightmare which became a reality,
now buried beneath myriads of more palatable thoughts.

The day after Kent and Jackson, campuses all over the
country responded. Black Student organizations sent contri-
butions to Jackson" and discussed and planned how to keep
it from happening again. Students demonstrated, cried,
‘cursed, and it looked as if the six’s martyrdom would be
the needed impetus for a giant movement surge.

But today it’s “What the well dressed collegian is
wearing by Esquire or Cosmopolitan” or “Do I like Win-
ky’s or McDonald's hamburgers better”, and then maybe a
sigarette pack or becoming acquainted withea brother from
Mississippi will stur the quickly passing memory of less
happy times on two other college campuses.

If nothing else, we must know by now that this coun-
try must change its ways. We’ve got to realize that our
only — our only strength lies in that overused much abused
expression; unity. Didn’t Kent and Jackson at least teach
us that?

We don’t have time to spend on the exercises and fruit-
lessness that we have termed “meaningful demonstrations”
in the past. Get your heads together. Unify. Plan some-
thing constructive — Because you are America’s only hope.
Save yourself. Save your brothers and sisters. Save Ameri-
ca. Six died in a movement, which you started.

t Maybe the Way is not quite clear yet, but it will be-
come apparent. Right now the Way is not even the critical

. thing. The desire has to come first. It was there once. Did

it die with the six. Don’t let our desire to right some terri-
ble wrongs change. I t- i - .

   

1 Off Campus Student

 Living, A

by BOB GING
News Editor

To most students who live in off-campus hous-
ing, finding and keeping an apartment has be-
come one of the major traumas of college life. If
one could look at the housing situation in Oak-
land and the general campus area. I'm sure he
would agree that it is a good example of free en-
terprise gone wild.‘

In theory. free enterprise usually encourages
competitors to fight for lower rates. The Oakland
landlord clique. however. knows that students
have no other choice but to rent from them. and
feels no compunction about raising rent as high
as possible.

What students now find themselves facing is
a situation of either sky high rents. or substandard
living quarters.

In many cases landlords charge from two to
three hundred dollars a month for “modern. lux-
ury apartments."‘,In most cases, a year lease is
required. and students find themselves committ-

ed to paying two to four thousand dollars a year‘

to live in an apartment.

These luxury apartments, which are available
at such a high rate, are for the most part old
and often condemned buildings, which a land-
lord will buy. renovate. and rent out at a maxi-
mum profit. The luxury facade is maintained by
furnishing the apartment with inexpensive furni-

Bad Trip

ture. bought in large quantities. which usually
does not hold up tothe wear and tear of every-
day life. -

Many landlords will require students to put
down a 150 to 200 dollar damage deposit. Few

.students ever see this damage deposit again‘ Ob-

viously. if inferior quality carpeting and furniture
are used, and the renovation is done in the short-
est time and for the least cost. many things will
fall apart in one year.

On the opposite end of the spectrum. are the
economy apartments. Although the majority of
these are livable. too many are substandard and
some are so bad as to be unhealthy.

These apartments are for the most part base-
ments, second" and third floors and sleeping
rooms. Many are owned by individuals. rather
than by a realtor or big landlord.

To often. in the economy- apartments. one
finds little or no heat. bad plumbing, uncoopera-
tive l-andlord and a myriad of other problems.
which help to make apartment living miserable.

To eliminate the plague of extravagant rents
and unlivable housing, the Pitt News is asking

. the students, faculty and administration to do
. their part to help remedy this situation.

.,
The Pitt News, in an effort to make the Uni-
versity community. better aware of the off-campus
housing situation will research and publish ‘a
special issue concerning off-campus housing.

dressed a banquet-full of colle-A

giate press award winners last
May and proceded to feed them
all several lines of bullshit for
dessert.

His major attack was against
the growing trend towards advo-
cacy journalism among the
young. who have still managed
to retain some modicum of ideal-
ism for the. "profession". “What
has happened to objectivity'?".
he asked. lementing the neo-
emergence of conscience in me_d-
ia-men and women. '

SINCE his speech and the
points therein were not open

for discussion. this writer was 7

not awarded the opportunity to
respond with the obvious ans-
wer. There is no such commodity
as objectivity; it is rather a justi-
fication for reinforcement of the
status quo and a subtle. indirect
means of oppression.

Unfortunately. Hawkins was
speaking for the pseudo-journa-
lists that he controls as the head
of a major metropolitan news-
paper and the other print and el-
ectronic media mongers in the
city.

All that one can ask of the
"professionals" is fairness — the
hallowed presentation of both
sides of the question. That's the
minimum. It's not enough. in
some cases. but it's the basic re-
quirement.

BUT THEN, we‘re dealing
with cowards. People that sneak
around and base their opinions
and policies on hurt feelings and
aborted ego trips.

Such is the caliber of John
Troan. Editor of the Pittsburgh
Press, who recently put a news
boycott on nearly every peace
group in the city. ~ '

His policy statement was pro-
voked (more likely’ planned) by

  
 
 

THE CITY media were ap_ Episcopal Peace Fellowship and
proached prior to the conference the U“iVe1‘SitY C0mmltte€ f0!‘
by its coordinator and requested
to forestay assigning a reporter
for coverage. The explanation
rested on the character of the
meeting: it was to be an attempt
to build a broad-based coalition
by ironing out inter-group‘con—
flicts and political differences.

The wisdom of the move was
self-revealing. The media have
been known to highlight con-
flicts and indirectly cripple ef-
fective organization. Troan chose
not to honor the ban; his report-
er was thrown out.

Consequently, the Editor re-
acting against a charge of “pig
media". barred coverage of more

One, of America/sy A ._

Women's Rights. In addition, the '

Press has cut off some of its big-
gest newsmakers. including the
Black Construction Coalition
and Hospital Workers’ Union
_1199P. ‘

CHARACTERISTICALLY, he
left himself a “neat" way out at
the end of his ego trip. “The
Press”, says Troan “will contin-
ue to cover important news events
no matter whom is involved.”

The time has come for “jour-
nalists" to consider the" possi-
bility of establishing an alter-
nate newspaper in this commun-
ity. Interested writers can con-
tact The Pitt News just to rap.

PCWR   Pushes
‘Human Relations’

(Editor's Note: Following is a statement from the Pittsburgh Council
for Women's Rights, prefaced by an introduction from the group's pres-
dent, Elizabeth Scott.)

The lack of austerity in city government is a cancerous disease to
the humane progress of our city. Austerity is more than firing a few
people from menial jobs or closing public accommodations that add to
the development of a better society: austerity is seeing that the direc-
tor in_ administration who makes from $18.000 to $25,000 is working
productively and seeing that those under him or her has the potential
for doing the same.

it will be her job to see that you.

see this and feel helpless about what to do. need we wonder why our city
and county sits on a powder keg.
We recommend:

(1) That there be extensive and indepth preparation and training in
the sciences of humanities for all levels of the Police Department: that
supervisors should be firm aboublack of qualifications and suspensions
if members fail to meet the standards of humanists.

(2) That there be an operative liaison between the Police Depart-
ment and in-service organizations. i.e.. public health agencies. housing
administration. etc.. in the city and county to understand the needs of
people. taking into consideration all age groups. race. sex. health con-
ditions. etc. 

(3) That there be a very strong link between the Police Depart-
ment and the City and state Human Relations Commission. Now is the
time to place more emphasis on preventive measures in keeping order.
It is unfair and unwise to place the Police Department on its own to_
protect our citizenry. keep order. and enforce the law without using all
other existing facilities. The Human Relations Commission should be a
strongasset to the department.

(4) The patrolmen and patrolwomen. who work intimately with the
community. be put in a more civilian dress rather than one that sug-
gests a military state.

(5) That. since we are in a time period when people are insisting
upon equal treatment. the Police Department should be composed of
members that make such differences. i.e.. race. sex. nationality. reli-
gion (in fair distributions of numbers) from the administration to com-
munity patrolmen and patrolwomen.

and taxpayers don't like to have
to support it.

_Some public aid is necessary.
We should be willing to support
the aged. disabled. and sick. and
to provide emergency funds for

anyone who is suddenly down and \
out financially. A nation as rich;
as America is expected to pro-

vide such an "insurance policy”
for unfortunates.

But this aspect of welfare isn‘t
the part that everybody complains
,about. The really sad program in
public aid is something called
Aid to Dependent Children——ADC.

ADC is. basically. a program
which gives a widowedvdivorced.
or unwed mother money to sup-
port her family. The program (in
Chicago) allows an adult 30-odd
dollars. plus a slightly smaller al-
lotment for each small child per
month. It will also support a fam-
ily whose chief breadwinner is
unemployed. '

COSTLY?

are entitled. These workers are so
overloaded that only a- few ofthe
best ones have time to do any ac-
tual—beneficial therepeutic case-
work.
THE WAITING ROOM

After several hours of waiting
on one of the long. wooden bench-
es. a caseworker comes up to you

and asks you to'step into her of—_

fiee. She is such a sweet young
thing. and you wonder how she

knows to ask such questions‘ as.

your two-year-old.

You will be limited to about $90
for rent (remember. rents in Chi-
cago are exceptionally high). plus
maybe six or seven dollars for
utilities. That gives you about
$168 per month to run your home.

Oh. yes. if you should have an-
other child. you will have to an-
swer all the questions all over
again before you receive your ad-
ditional $20.01. You see. it's not
very profitable at all.

In Defense
Of Cabbies

Dear Sir:

I read with amazement your
editorial in the July 27 edition
of The Pitt News. “You Can't
Even Pay Some to Drive
Through" would have been
amusing. if it had not contained
so many distortions and half-
truths. Your statement that the

"City's methods of transporting -

its citizens is obriously not de-
signed for Black People" is
simply not true. Unless you dif-
ferentiate between the local Cab
companies. The Peoples. and
Yellow. and the. Port Authority.
there is no basis for your sweep-
ing indictment.

The transportation furnished
by the P.A.T. is as good in the
ghetto areas during rush hours

~ and the day-time as it is in the

more affluent neighborhoods.
The Hill District is served at
regular intervals by four Buses.
81A, 81C. 82 and-84A. Home-
wood is served by four Buses
75. 76. 87. and 88 and the" Buses
serving North Side are too
numerous to mention. In fact

when the P.A.T. took over the
route for 81C was laid out only
after consultation with the com-
muters who were to be served.

I acknowledge that is almost
impossible to get a cab in any
of the three major ghetto areas.
However. as~a former resident of
the Hill and Homewood districts
I can testify that it was not al-
ways so.

At one time the cab drivers
responded to calls from these
areas with the same alacrity that
they did to calls from anywhere
else. In fact there was a time"
when cab drivers vied to serve

the Hill as it was alleged that .

there was when the money was.
Of course in those days any
woman. black. brown. yellow. or
white could walk the streets
unaccompanied and unmolested.

It was only after the Hoodluml

elements saturated these areas
and the phenomenal increase
in crime that the Taxi Cab situ-
ation became desperate. Most
cab driver's regardless of their
ethniciorigin avoid these places.
especially at night.

You cite cases where elderly
black people had to be taken to
hospitals for treatment of frost
bites, incurred while waiting
for public" transportation. This
would seem to indicate a delay
caused by climatic conditions
rather than a deep dark plot to
avoid serving Blacks.

One must assume under simi-
lar conditions that older. white
people would also suffer frost-
bite. The Port Authority and its
predecessor the Pgh. Railways
Co. have always served the areas
of Pittsburgh indiscriminantly
and the P.A.T. has a legitimate
grievance. against illegal—trans-
portation.

Editor's Note:
letter lacks an
of information. Pitt News
staffers do not receive scholar-
ship compensation for their work
on the paper. The staff went on
strike in October of last year be-
cause the previous method of
payment was inadequate; the
feeling ran that salaries would
be fairer in the long run and
this money was not taken from
tuition fees. However, the salary
question is as yet unanswered.
Student Government has not at
this point moved on it. As far

The preceding
important point

. as academic credit is concerned

for staffers, one credit per term
was alloted as long as each indi-
vidual worker attended a two
hour per week seminar. This
seminar was open to all Univer-
sity students, not just those who
were currently working on The
Pitt News.

Mr. Don Marbury
Editor Pitt News

Despite. some good articles

on Women's Rights and at least
one feminist writer, The Pitt

News is still coming across as
the sexiest newspaper.

We don't have much access to
The Pitt News in Salk Hall but
in the occasional copies 1 see I
have read two emotional person-
al diatribes against women. in-
cluding the one in the August
6. letters and one against the
woman policeperson.

_

In addition. your sports pages
are not just sports pages, they
are men's sports pages. And if
there is no news concerning

women's sports. have you inv_es- A

tigated why: Is it because there
is insufficient funding for wo-
men? And what about the Lei-
sure-learn program‘? Weren't there
girls involved too‘? What pro-
portion? Why? And look at the
number of male vs. female pic-
tures. . . 8 females, 18 males.
And what were all the females
who were pictured? Nurses or
actresses, two stereotypically fe-
male occupations. '

To sum it up. the August 6
issue of The Pitt News was a
sexist issue. In it. women were
ignoredﬁstereotyped, reviled or
not there because of restrictions.
I think The Pitt News can and
should be a leader for reforms,
not another element supporting
the deep rooted and pervasive
prejudice against women.
men constitute half the student
population, so they should be
seen in half The Pitt News space.

Sincerely yours.

Ina Braden. Ph.D.
President, University Com-
mittee for Women's Rights

Health Students Protest lnequities Phone Numbers

(Editor's Note: Earlier this sum-
mer, a coalition of the Dental and
Medical Student Associations or-
Ianized to protest the inequities of
Hie current scholarship allocation
methods. The groups forwarded a
letter to The Pitt News for publica-
tion in order to decipher whether
the students involved would be
willingito strike rather than pay
exorbitant tuition fees. The Pitt
News, however, was not printing.

"(Although the due date for ig-
voices has already passed, health
students are urged to fill out the
survey below and send_ responses
to: Student American Medical As-
sociation and Student American
Dental Associatioh, P. O. Box 7341,
Pittsburgh, Pa. 15213. Following
is the rationale for the proposed
action.)

Editor. The Pitt News:

The Student American Dental
Association and the ._Student
American ‘ Medical Association,
which are the student govern-
ments of the Dental and Medical
Schools. respectively, are con-
ducting a survey of student reac-
tionto the tuition increase.

As these surveys are returned.
a general student concensus will
be achieved and an appropriate
course of action will be formu-
lated. -

Reasons for this move are as
follows:

(1) It is through the irresponsi-
ble actions of state legislators in
tax and budget affairs that neces-
sitates such a tuition increase. We
would like to demonstrate:

(a) The need for the full state
appropriation to the University:
lb) The need for a more equit-
able tuition raise.
(2) A tuition
per cent is very difficult to meet.
(3) Aggravating the tuition in-
crease is the fact that Health Pro-

'-fessions student’ aid may not be ‘

available this ,year or will be
drastically reduced.

.(4) The second and third year
dental students are required to at-
tend clinic session 20 hours per
‘week. This limits their summer
earning power.

With all of these roadblocks.
how is one to meet such a great

tuition increase. particularly on Sl“Cerel.VY°“TS-

such short notice‘? It is virtually Executive Committee
impossible SAMA and SADA

  Cuitian Proﬁt Sc/zalultd

As you have been notified by the Chancellor's letter of July 1. large
tuition increases have been adopted for the coming year. In the Medical
and Dental schools. this increase is approximately twice as great as
for the rest of the University. Pennsylvania residents face a 43 per cent
increase from $355 to $510 per term; out-of-state students will be
charged $1.200 per term. a 36 per cent increase.

Many students feel they are unable to finance such a large in-
crease. and question the rationale behind it. If indeed our state and na-
tion drastically need more health professionals. how can one justify
making their education even more difficult to obtain‘?

Why twice as large an increase for medical and dental students?
Why aren’t professional students eligible for fellowships like other
graduate students? Why is the University straining to increase enroll-
ment at the expense of quality education while the state refuses to hon-
or its obligations? Are the people of Penhsylvania willing to risk having
fewer dentists and physicians in the future? -

The purpose of this letter is to give you an opportunity to express-
our views. Students at‘Temple have responded with a tuition strike.
he purpose of such an action are to draw public attention to the prob-

lem. to encourage re-consideration by the University. and ultimately to
pressure the Legislature to come to our aid.

Please fill in the enclosed form and mail it as soon as possible.

I pledge to strike the proposed tuition increase. I will pay only the
the. same tuition as last year ($355/term-Pa. resident. $800

I pledge to pay only as much tuition as all other graduate and un-
dergraduate students at the University ($425/term-Pa. resi-

"What am I doing here?."

(Editor's Note: The following
column dealing with the fascist
regime in Greece was opened
jointly by Stavros Semanderes,
a graduate student in Nuclear
Science at Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity and Dine Contis, a grad-
uate student in Public Health
Administration at Pitt. -Both are
Greek Americans, although Sem-
anderes was born in the Medi-
terranean country, emigrating
here when 14 years old. The

writers are affiliated with the
Pittsburgh Committee for Dem-
ocracy in Greece a nd loosely

connected with ~ Resistance move-
ments in other parts of the Unit-
ed States and Europe. Semander-
es is willing to speak to inter-
ested groups or individuals- on

‘ the Greek problem. He can be
h contacted through The Pitt News.

Additional information may be

ing their intention to remedy the
defects of the establishment and
to create in the near future "a
true democracy on a -healthy ba-
sis“.

However. after three long
years. most of the suspended
liberties have not been restored.
Persecutions of all forms are
continuously taking place. Even
undisputed cases of appalling
tortures and brutality are fre-
quently reported.

HISTORY

The timeless affirmation and
quest of freedom by the Greek
people is well known./Their pre-
sent inaction under the boot of
fascism is. to many. puzzling.

It begs the question. Why‘?
The seeming apathy of the Greeks
evolved from a combination of
naivete and deception. Initially.
the public declarations by the
Colonels that they were merely
a temporary phenomenon dedi-
cated to the orderly transfer of
power to a constitutional govern-
mentgtogether with the popular
belief that America has support-
ed the coup d‘etat. served to pa-
cify the populace.

The consensus was ‘that Am-
erica is complicity implied an ul-
timate return to democracy. The
high-blown rhetoric of America
since the Truman Doctrine was

"a storehouse of hope.

It was this fatal miscalculation
which gave the Colonels time to
plant their roots of oppression.

A “new constitution". drafted by
the junta and in a rigged re-
ferendum “approved" by the
people. was imposed.

A provision of the constitution
gave the government the power

' to suspend all civil liberties at

its whim. Such is the state of
things. Martial law reigns: all
political activity is outlawed and
party leaders imprisoned or ex-
iled.

NO FREE PRESS

The press serves the Junta. The
universities no longer discourse
on freedom or further knowledge.
rather they are academies of in-
tellectual impotence.

Teachers and students alike are
regularly imprisoned and like
other “enemies of the state“
subjected to systematic brutali-
zation by torture. A broad‘ net-
work of informers has woven a
web of suspicion and terror

_ throughout the country.

To insure its perpetration. the
regime is vigorously applying a
program of “re-education". All
the elements of classic reaction-
ary ideology are in motion. Mur-I
der and assasination are justi-
fied in the name of the Church.
repression wrapped.in the flag.
Library shelves are empty of the
works of Euripides. Sophocles.
and Aristophayes. Anti-intellec-
tualism is being officially prose-
cuted: academic scholarship is
condemned as elitism and a
threat to the new order. Scien-
tific inquiry is dormant. politi-
cal discourse — dead.

IN HUMANITY

-Seemingly immune from ap-
peals for humanity, the fascists
seal the fate of the Greek peo-
ple. Condemnation by the Euro-
pean Commission on Human
Rights is met with derision. ex-

_pulsion by the Council of Euro-

pean States is ignored. What
buoys such cynicism and brash
confidence‘?

Perhaps the words of Inspect-
or Basil Lambrou. addressed to
political prisoners brought be-
fore him may enlighten us:

“You make yourself ridiculous
by thinking you can do any-
thing. The world is divided in
two. There are the Communists
on that side and on this side the
Free World. The Russians and the
Americans, no one else. What
are we? Americans. Behind me
there is NATO, behind NATO is
the U.S. You can't fight us, we
are Americans.”

We. "the Americans". then are
indicated. as much by our be-
nign and self—serving posture to
date. as by our military and dip-
lomatic support. for the contin-
ued. subjugation of the Greek
people.

Attacked By Five

March 19. l970—‘ Pittsburgh
Press headlines on front page.
“Melee in Magistrates Court“.

The result of the Police riot
which stemmed from the trial of
eight draft protesters on trump-
ed-up charges of Disorderly Con-
duct was the arrest of five peo-
ple in the courtroom who were
beaten by Police.

Charges included‘ inciting to
riot. aggravated assault and
battery. disorderly conduct and
resisting arrest. As is common
Police practice whenever they
do bodily harm to a person. they
charge that person with assault
to justify. the beating. One of the
defendents had three inches of
hair pulled out of his scalp. An-
other defendent required eight
stitches to close a scalp lacera-
tion. The same defendent. Kenny
Boas. also suffered torn liga-
ments in his knee.

The defendents have retained
William Kunstler. attorney for
the Chicago 7. Harry Swanger
and Martha Alshuler to file char-
ges against Police for attempt-
ing to "chill and deter” the ex-
ercise of rights guaranteed in
the Constitution.

The defendents.- Cappy As-
cheim. Kenny Boas. Mark Cohen.
Rob Ruck and Tom Simonds
have filed charges against Fran-
cis Quinlan. Fraternal Order of
Police President Stephen Joyce
(Superintendent of Police). Rob-
ert W. Duggan (District Attor-
ney) and nine others.

‘The defendents need the sup-
port of all people concerned
with the increasing repression in
Amerika. A conviction of the de-
fendents could amount to jail
terms ranging from two to five
years each.

Plastic Elicits 
  Mild Response

More than 600 respondents

' greeted SAGA Food Service’s
‘ summer experiment with plastic

utensils with an indifferent “so
what.” a -
Assistant Director of Housing
Will ‘Miller said that though there
was no “harsh negative reac-
tion,” most of those who respond-

ﬂed had little criticism or praise

for the plastic ware.
SAGA used the synthetic uten-

I sils for all meals throughout the

period from July 19 to Aug. 1. All
who ate in the Towers Cafeteria
itluring those two weeks were ask-
ed to fill out response cards, rat-
ing the plastic ware generally and
each utensil individually. Of the
600 people who correctly com-
ioleted the forms, about two—thirds
were students and convention-
eers. The remaining 200 were

7 freshmen participating in the New

Student Workshop.

REGISTRATION ERRORS

A new, computerized regis-
_ tration system experiencing
l _ some “bugs” and the unexpect-
edly large number of freshmen
have combined to snarl the
registration process at the Uni-
versity. ’
Most of the mistakes involve

ous fees, such as music, physi-
cal edtication, and vocational
education fees. Other students
have been incorrectly invoiced
due to improperly specified
course codes, which the com-
puter automatically reiects.

The addition of some 300
freshmen students, greater
than the numbered expected,
created a situation in which
the number of students regis-
tered for certain classes ex-
A. ceeded the capacities of those
_s classes, thus furthering the _

’ registration turmoil. "S '

Posvar, who faced the new term

“The responses of the fresh-
men,”’ said Miller, “differed
somewhat from the others’.

‘Whereas the regular students

were largely neutral, freshmen
were either extremely favorable
or extremely unfavorable,°with
very little in between.”

What little criticism there was
centered around the coffee cup.
Coffee drinkers were upset to
find the cups getting “mushy”
when filled with hot coffee.

Some also feared a disposal
problem, thinking that the plastic
would not burn without polluting
the air. “That,” Miller revealed,
“is a false conception. The plastic
can be burned with nothing harm-
ful_given off.”

Though SAGA has no immediate.

plans to implement the plastic
table ware on a more permanent
basis, a cost study is being under-
taken to determine the feasibility
of the use of plastic in the cafe-
terias of future housing develop-
ments.

Run By "Non-entrepreneurs”

 

Anti-profit Store “Pays”

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

Although the going was “rough
at first," a couple of local Univer-
sity students are making the con-
cept of an anti-profit store “pay
off.” '

Joe Anderson, senior at the Uni-
versity, and Dick Low, studying
at C-MU, started their Free Peo-
ples’ Store in May, pricing their
merchandize as “cheaply as pos-
sible."

“It’s a very socialistic kind of
thing," explained Anderson. “All
profits are put directly back into
the store or given to the commun-
ity." ’

The bare-floored center, sport-
ing walls dotted with the work .of
local artists and potters, deals
mainly in record sales. Four dol-
lars and ninety-eight cents discs
go for about $2.99 and $6 platters
sell for $3.60.

Anderson claims that if a buyer

“goes anywhere else, the money  ‘

goes into somebody’s pocket from
Squirrel Hill who uses the money
to go on vacation the next year.”
The Store’s prices are just above
wholesale, with the excess used
for maintenance of the location.

The two . “non-entrepreneurs"
are planning to initiate “posters
and trappings” sales as soon as
possible. Already, they relate, the
Art Institute of Pittsburgh util-
izes their space to exhibit arts
and crafts.

The managers ask for only a 15
per cent commission, in contrast
to other places where a 35-50 per
cent commission is required.

Besides store maintenance the
store donates money to political
groups in the city and day care es-

New Hillel Director

Racovsky Seeks Change

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Rabbi Boris A. Rackovsky.
newly appointed director of the
B’nai B’rith Hillel Foundation
(BBHF), checked into his new
Pittsburgh residence carrying all
the belongings he brought with
him. Inside one of his baggages
was an array of fresh and exciting
ideas and programs.

This particular piece of lug-
gage, however, must wait for stu-
dent concensus before the-Rabbi
opens it. This is one of the fore-
most ‘objectives of his administra-
.tion—to serve Jewish students by
placing a large share of imple-
mentation in their hands. .

“This University,” Rabbi Rack-
ovsky asserted, “has such a large
student body with a tremendous
diversity of backgrounds and in-
terests. We must structure Hillel
to make it appealing to all groups
"of Jewish students.“

The Rabbi, whose recent job
was with the Hillel Foundation at
Northwestern University in Illi-
nois, once held a position at the
University of Melbourne, Austra-

_ lia, which he considers “very sim-

iliar” to his present one. “The or- ,

ganization in Pittsburgh, like that
in Melbourne, is very decentral-
ized,” he noted, “and this allows
for a greater degree of competive-
ness among city schools. Pitt, Du-
quesne, and Carnegie-Mellon can

each have differently structured 4

programs that will appeal to dif-
ferent segments of Jews.”

Rabbi Rackovsky wants to see
a program that would focus on the
cultural aspect, the Rabbi stress-
ed that Hillel “should support any
cultural effort." Such projects
include an attempt to establish a
Judaic Studies Department at the
University.

Hillel will also institute a draft-
counseling center,
will offer assistance to conscien-
tious -objectors, suggestions of
possible alternatives, and infor-
mation regarding the Selective
Service System in general.

Commenting on the relationship
that Hillel has with the Universi-
ty, the Rabbi described it as “lia-
sonian” in which BBHF serves as\
a representative of Jewish stu-
dents to the administration.

The service ‘

Presently. the new director is
in the process of meeting with as
many Jewish students as possible
before implementing any new
programs or activities. He has
compiled a list of Jewish students
on campus and sent each of them
letters encouraging them to dis-
cuss their ideas with him. This.
Rackovsky insists. will acquaint

= him with the various needs and

challenges that Hillel will have to
meet.

The Rabbi reports that in the
short time he has been here. the
response to his invitation has been
"overwhelming."

Administrators Promoted

Two members of the adminis-
tration at the University were
promoted last month through ac-

L tion of the Board of Trustees.

Jack E. Freeman, formerly As-
sistant to the Chancellor, was
named Executive Assistant Chan-
cellor. and Bernard Kobosky. for-
merly Assistant Chancellor for
Student Affairs, was named Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs.

Announcement of the appoint-
ments was made by Chancellor
Wesley W. Posvar.

These actions, which involve no
change in organization, were tak-
en to reflect enlargements: over
the past several months in the
scope and levels of responsibility
of Mr. Freeman and Mr. Kobosky.

Mr. Freeman, who holds a B.A.
and M.A. from Baylor Universi-
ty. joined Pitt in 1967 from a posi-

‘tion as Assistant to the Deputy

Under Secretary of the Air Force.
He previously served in the In-
ternational Affairs Division, Di-
rectorate of Plans, HQ USAF, in
the Pentagon and before that was
asistant professor in the Depart-
ment of Political Scienceat the
Air Force Academy. He has also
served on the faculties of the
Southern Colorado State College,
the University of Maryland, and
Pitt.

Mr. Kobosky, who holds a B.A.
and M.gA. from Duquesne Univer-
sity, came to Pitt in 1966 as Direc-

tor of Admissions. Prior to joining .

Pitt, Mr. Kobosky was admissions
officer at Duquesne, a teacher
and guidance counselor at Mt.
Lebanon High School and a history
teacher at Canonsburg High

4 School.

Duo Exudes Warmth

News Editor

- Wengert and Newcombe, or
Ken and Bob, as they prefer to
be called, may sound like an
unp and coming comedy team
but in fact they are the new
Dean of Admissions and Stu-
dent Aid and Director of Ad-
missions, respectively.

The jovial, backslapping duo
are wont to kid a lot, but both
cooperated when (The Pitt News)
asked for a serious assessmentlof
their roles and a frank explana-
tion of their views;

Both clearly regard Pennsyl-
vania high schools as the Ad-
missions Office’s principal re-
cruiting areas. Pennsylvania stu-
dents are of “prime concern,”
Wengert. emphasized, “because
of state-relatedness and because
it's very costly to pick up stu-

’ dents from other areas.” ~

Newcombe agreed, adding that
it is extremely difficult to at-
tract students» from the South,
the Mid-West, andthe Far West.
He suggested, however, that the
student body here might become
more cosmopolitan if the ' Ad-
missions Office pays more atten-
tion to rural schools in the tri-
state area.

“It would kind of add .a new
dimension," he observed, “if we
would attract and recruit more
students from small town areas

. young people, perhaps un-‘
sophisticated in a sense. but who

have a kind of background that

would be good for Pitt."
Wengert, mindful of the Uni-

“versity’s ties with the State Leg-

islature, noted that some Penn-
sylvania students admitted to
Pitt are unable to attend because
they lack funds. He wished out-

loud that a guarantee of some

V‘ kind could be made, not only for

the sake of the students involv-
ed but also to please. Harrisburg.

“The aim of the Admissions
and Student Aid Offices,” he
elaborated, “will be to assure stu-
dents who are admitted and who
demonstrate a need for financial

' assistance that we will be able

to help them in some kind of
fashion, through a combination
of scholarships, loans, and part-
time employment."

Tossing out a new idea which,
it brought to fruition, would re-
present a significant change in
admissions procedures at Pitt,
Wingert and Newcomb express-
ed dissatisfaction with the pre-
sent method’ of guessing how
many students will decide to
matriculate in any given year.
They spoke favorably of the
“waiting list“ procedure which
is standard practice, at many
universities.

Strike Helps To

Restore Security

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

Summer-long negotiations be-
tween the University and the
University security police aided
by a half-day strike by the se-
curity force have resulted in,a
new contract and a new head for
the campus policemen.

The new 38-month pact calls
for a starting salary of $3.00 an
hour for rookie patrolmen and
graduated increases with senior-
ity to the maximum $3.85 an hour

_ for four-year men. Previously. the

starting salary was $2.55 an hour,
and the most senior patrolmen re-
ceived $3.10 an hour.

_The current contract, retroac-
tive to /July 1, 1970, also guar-

S - antees salary hikes of $.20 and
' $.22 hourly for all members over

the next two years.

Other points of the contract in-
clude:

— Recognition of the security
force as the legitimate bar-

gaining unit (union) ;

— A no stoppage, slowdown. or
strike clause covering the en-
tire span of the agreement;

— A six-month probationary per-
iod for all freshmen force mem-
bers;

— Mandatory joining of the bar-
gaining unit by all patrolmen
after 60 days on the force;

— The right of the University to
discipline and discharge force
members pending notification
of the bargaining iinit,

’ — Free uniforms for non-proba-

  

’ per year replacement, allow-

tionary patrolmen, plus a- $120

  

 

ances along with salary disputes
dominated the early negotiations,
and the often bitter charges and
counter-charges by both sides
eliminated the possibility of rap-
id settlement.

Several months of haggling
tentatively resolved all matters
except the length of the contract.

"’ the University offering a four-

year pact and the police pressing
for one of three years.

When neither side appeared
willing to compromise. the 62-
man police force voted to strike.
On the morning of Wednesday.
August 12, the policemen walked
off the job and picketed the Uni-
versity. ,

The strike, however, was short-
lived. With the beginning of the
fall term only weeks away, the
threat of a “police-less” campus
caused the disputants to reconsid-
er their demands. The 38-month
contract was agreed upon before
the end of the day.

A casualty of the negotiations
was Captain Charles Ray. former
head of the security force. Ray.
who officially retired in early
August, did so amig rumors of
dissension on the force. Many
of the security guards were re-
portedly miffed at Ray for what
they considered his less than en-
thusiastic support of their aims.

At one point in the negotia-
tions, "Ray allegedly proposed a
contract to his men that called
for substantial pay raises, failing
to explain that these would be
achieved only after 17 years. ’

Further clashes between Ray
and the security force were cir-

.,,,cu.rn,vented by Rayfst retirement-..  W
Robert Merritt: was{nairied-t-‘oi~suc.-*

-come knowing students."

 

“We hope ‘to go to a waiting
list kind of thing,” Wengert said
cautiously, stressing that the
scheme is just a “possibility”
and not a plan. He said he would
like to work up an arrangement
with branch campuses, so that
students placed on the waiting
list for Oakland would be guar-
anteed a spot at Johnstown, Tit-
usville, Greensburg, or Bradford.

The disgruntlement, Wengert
and Newcombefeel. stems at
least partially from the fact that
the Admissions Office expected
afreshman class this year of
2200 but now finds Pitt blessed
with 2500 instead.

Wengert and Newcombe are.

anxious to get to know students.
for at least two reasons. “I wel-
New-
combe beamed, as he spoke with
one on the phone while another
sat with him in his office. “I
enjoy this."

Also, the two realize, in New-
combe's words, that “students are
your best salesmen. If you have
satisfied students who return to
their home towns, they can do
more good for the Admissions Of-
fice in many cases than profes-
sional staff."

Wengert, who served for the
past ten years as Director of Ad-
missions at Carnegie-Mellon Un-
iversity (CMU), is a quick think-
er whose insight and eloquence
are -notable. Newcombe, who
came to Pitt from Penn State,
appears to be a good organizer
with experience.

-Their good humorshould prove

l an asset during a hectic, some-

times frustrating. year.

CA5 14 REOPENED

The College of the Arts
and Sciences (CAS) as an- ’
nounced that a newly ar-
ranged course in drugs has
been reopened for registra-
tion. The 3 credit course,
listed as CA5 14, is offered
at 10 a.m. Mondays, Wednes- '
days and Fridays for the Fall
Term.

Handled by a team of
teachers, ‘the course will
deal with the effects of drugs
on the individual and socie-
ty. Lecture topics include
the psychological aspects of
drug usage, the effects of
certain narcotics on the re-
productive system and the
brain and “drug interac-
tion." .

Although a College spokes-
man lacked schedule infor-
mation on CAS 5, Technol-
ogy and the Human Condi-
tion, that course is also avail-
able for sign up this week.

Taught by Dean Harold
Hoeischer of the School of
Engineering, the 3 credit
course will emphasize the re-
lationship of knowledge and
technology to society. Both
courses were reopened in re-
sponse to student demand.

Chief Asks
by D0l:3l;‘lARBURY

The supervisor of the campus
police department feels that the
University community must be-
come more aware of the role of
the security force in campus liv-
ing.

Robert K. Merritt, new head of
the force, stressed recently that
there are quite a few things
which happen on this campus,
which would normally be the
concern the campus police, that
go unreported. .

“We have to try for some kind
of community awareness pro-
gram, Merritt said, because many
of the students come from small
communities and just don't know
some of the things to watch our
for.”

He said that part of the pol-
ice-community gap was due to
the attitude by much of the com-
munity that campus
was a “cartoon police force.”

“You can't put enough police
in to do a job without the citi-
zens, in this case the University
community,” the supervisor con-
tinued, “but if they will call us
we will respond.”

Merritt said he had no com-
plaint with the dances at the
University which are opened to

 

security .

 

Awareness

the community, and would like
to see the order of them conduct-
ed more so by the students.

“Social affairs are the great-
est thing in the world for any-
one,” he commented, “and peo-
ple want to participate in them
as freely as possible,” but we
still have to provide security for
them.

He said he would like to see a ’

change occur where his men
would not have to become in-
volved in them at all except
where there was no other choice
or where the situation definitely
warrented police intervention.

“This would reduce the con- .
frontation element, which is pre- «-

sent at times," Merritt continued.

He emphasized that in cases
where a gun or a knife was in-
troduced would warrent his men
taking action but “say two guys
arguing over a girl or another
with a little too much to drink
wouldn’,t warrent action,” he ill-
ustrated.

He emphasized that it would
take‘ faculty and staff to help
implement some sort of similar
system.

"I would personally like to see I

some administrative guidance for
this," he concluded, “rather than
us having to rely on gut reac-
tions.“

Coffee House Adds Spice

‘Creaser-A Gap-filler’

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

Three University “gourmets"
are trying to spice up the “disap-
pointment diet" that faces cul-
turally oriented members of this
community.

Jack Wolford, Dan Ochiva and
Ellen Stenzel have been nursing
the Greazer Coffeehouse for a
year and one half to date and their
brainchild is finally beginning to
walk.

Wolford. an undergraduate in
English here. is attempting to
veer away from the traditional
coffeehouse concept. “with a cou-
ple of folk guitars and a few cups
of coffee."

His impided involves the es-
tablishment of a “gap-filler.“

“With all the facilities the Uni-
versity provides, there is not one
place set aside as a meeting
ground for students where enter-
tainment,_ stimulation, and dia-
logue are_common fare on a day to
day basis,” he ascertains.

Pragmatically speaking. he
hopes to convert the Hunt Room
in the SU into a nightly gathering
place with accommodations for 10-
cal poets, musicians and artists.

Although he commends the In-

that “in the informal atmosphere
of a coffeehouse. audience parti-
cipation would be a reasonably
easy function to establish.

In line with the plans of the
committee. the Greazer would
operate as a sounding board for
any local artist who desires an
audience.

Long term plans include the use
of the Greazer walls as exhibi-
tion cases for paintings, sculp-
ture and graphic selections. The
Greazer staff would handle sale
of the works, requesting a 15
per cent commission to be fed

Dissatisfaction with city and
University sponsorship of poetry

mittee to propose that the House
take on the responsibility of
bringing in poets from other loca-
tions in the country.

include scheduling occasional eve-
ning of stage performance. at no

NEW COURSES

The College of Arts and Sci-
ences is offering two new Cur-
rent Problems courses in the
fall courses in the fall term.

 
   
     
 

One course, to begtaught by
Dr. Steven Rosen of the Politi-
cal Science Department, is call-
ed War and Revolution: Ethics,
Policy and Research. It will
deal with the implications of
research on war and revolu-
tion and will stress humanistic
and policy questions.

   

he views the place as a potential
“movie house” for a number of
the old classics, directed by such
men as Alfred Hitchcock and
Jean-Luc Godard, films which
have been in storage for a few
years.

 
     
   
     
   
   
 

The Greazer, sponsored by
Dean of the College of the Arts
and Sciences Dr. Jerome Schnee-
wind is currently awaiting formal
recognition as a student organiza-
tion and an allocation of funds
from Student Government.

The other course, taught by
Dr. Jerome Laulicht of the So-
ciology Department, is called
Arms Control and Disarma-
ment. The major purpose will
be to explore problems and
possibilities for disarmament
among small as well as large
nations. This course will ex-
plore the implications of weap-
on systems for man's contin-
ued existence on earth, and
will give as much weight to
the ethical and policy ques-
tions on ABM and SALT as to
technical issues.

 
       
     
    

  

 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
  

Wolford and his fellow workers
hope to introduce something “uni-
que" with the advent of the Greaz-
er. —

"Tower B Snackbar. the sole
simulacrum of what we propose.
brutishly functions in this capaci-
ty. reminding one alternately of
MacDonald's and the Pittsburgh
but any Congeniality
there‘ is homemade and diaphon-
ous, disipating with the departure
of its initiators,“ he said.

Both courses are open to all
students. They may be the
forerunners of a new interdis-
ciplinary program on conflict
and conflict resesolution, if
enough students are interested
in the ways and means of find-
ing peace within and among
nations.

The hope is that the Greazer
may be more permanent.

Massive Expansion Set For Future

by MICHAEL SIMON-

A dynamic new program of ex-
pansions with new complexes for
virtually every department of the
University will be constructed
within the next 10-15 years.

According to Edison Montgom-
ery, Vice Chancellor of Finance,
two projects previously held be-
cause of the dispute between the
construction workers and the
Black Construction Coalition
(BBC) are nearly completed. The
Engineering Bldg., on O’Hara St.,
and the ‘Chemistry Bldg., to be
built near State Hall, willbe fin-
ished by 1973.

Phase I of the Forbes Field De-

  velopment, encompasses a Social

Sciences Center and a new School

S‘ of Education. A new Law School
.‘ to be built beside Phase I and the
Hillside Dormitores, which would._
house 1,250 students, will be lo-

cated near Pitt Stadium.
To alleviate the transportation

4 ' problem to and from the dormi-
tories, an above ground escalator

going down to the site of the
Learning Research Development
center is planned. Presently, this
is the location of the cyclotron on
O’Hara St.

Near the Hillside Dorms would

.be a parking lot on the present

site of the Oakland Lutheran Cem-

— etary. A shuttle bus service from

the parking lot to the dorms is
included.

The last building to be com-
pleted by 1973 is the Nursing and

I Allied Health Professions Center

to be located on top of the parking
garage on Victoria Ave.

Montgomery asserted that the
dorms and the Phase I project are
held up because the state legisla-
ture has not yet appropriated
funds. ,-

.- Separate funding agencies are

_ being used for the remaining pro-

jects.

Once funds are located, how-
ever, another setback appears,
mainly, the BCC, he evaluated.

As of yet, he said, the BBC has
not come to any agreement with

‘- many construction companies. so

any actual construction on re-
maining projects ’has been stop-
ped.

The Vice-Chancellor added a

word of clarification is needed.

The funds from the state legisla-

  ture for the buildings comes out

  

   

/1‘

of the capital budget. He explain-
ed, ‘the capital budget can be liken-
ed‘ to an appropriation budget, or
one that does not cause immedi-
ate monetary problems. Present-
ly, the operation budget, which is
money to keep things running, is

causing Pennsylvania troubles.

‘Barring the previously mention-

ed setbacks, concluded a n e w
‘ group of buildings should be com-

pleted by 1975.

Phase II, which includes a Hu-
manities Center and Graduate
School of Public and Internation-

F al Affairs (GSPIA), also, a new
multi-functional Health Profe_s-I

sions Building will be built-

on Victoria Ave.

Simultaneously, Pitt’s Student
Union will have acquired a huge
wrap around structure. Once the
wrap around is ‘finished, the old
Student Union will gutted and rev-
ovated.

The completion date for the
third set of new complexes should
be 1979.

Phase III will be a School of So-
cial Work, School of Business, and
possibly a new library to accom-
modate all, the previous, expan-

‘ * _ sion.

an industrial designer, to present
a study on the feasibility of using
a few simple forms, for maxi-
mum flexibility in the projects.

For example, moveable walls,
and shelves could conceivably

_, create more flexible, and usable

space that would meet the needs
of a large University. Mr. Low-
ey’s study will be ready‘ in one
year.

There is one final drawback,
which may cause future construc-

tion to halt. As more buildings are V

constructed, and more funds are
alloted eventually. a legislature
in the near future is going to be
without funds.

Funds for Pitt‘s expansion pro-
gram need not be in the state's
treasury at the present time. Due
to this. the Capital Budget of the
future may have no funds in it. as
it is paying for buildings already
constructed. '

Pitt’s tentative enrollment. by
1979, is estimated to be 22.000
full time students. and 9.000 part
time students.

This year. the University of
Pittsburgh. through the combined

‘efforts of the Student Informa-

,-..

,. :

tion Service and the Reservations
Offices. is offering students a
comprehensive system for both
the dissemination and obtaining
of information about the Univer-
sity and its activities.

“We provide a'system students
can use to get information to all
of the University community."
said Mr. William J. Lenaghen.
Assistant Director of Student Ac-
tivities. . I

The Information Service, ‘un-
der the supervision of Mrs. Lois
Martin, provides several channels
through which information about
student activities and events may
reach the widest possible aud-
ience. ~

Information Service will mail
publicity posters to all University
buildings to be displayed in dor-

 

mitories, offices, and depart-

Services‘Help Spread,
ments. The Service is equipped

to handle up to 260 posters for
mailing. —

Posters are also placed on bul-
letin boards in the Cathedral and
Student Union. and on standards
in the Union. Posters in these
areas require no official stamp.
(The only places still requiring
such stamps are the Dental
School and University housing.)

“Last year we handled about
30,000 posters,” said Lenaghen,
“which is one reason they discon-
tinued stamping them.”

“In September, the busiest
time. we handle up to. 1.000
posters a day in mailing."

Posters brought to the Infor-
mation Service Office in the
morning are sent out in the even-
ing mail, so that students are in-
sured of rapid handling of their
publicity materials. ’

The Information Service will
also provide advertising advice

to campus groups, including es-
timates of cost, exposure, and
suggestions of methods.

"Elevator signs. for example,
are not worth the money." noted
Lenaghen. “For the busiest times
of the year. they are up only one
or two days. So many pile up
that they can't be used any long-
er.

The Assistant Director suggest-
ed that advertisements in camp-
us publications. at a cost com-
parable to those of elevator signs.
might reach a larger segment of

the student body.

Information Service. also pub-
lishes a daily bulletin entitled
“Today in the University,” list-
ing all University events, as well
as those taking place in the im-
mediate community.

“Today in the University“ is
issued the day before published
events are scheduled. and is
available at Hillman Library,
the Student Union Information
Desk. the Cathedral Information
Desk. and the Towers Desk.

Student groups who wish to
have their events listed on the
bulletin must submit a University
Event Registration.

The Event Registration is a
triple copy form, one part of
which is sent to Information Ser-
vices Office for “Today in the
University”, one part to Student
Government for the Activities
Calendar, and one part to the
University Times forthe Univer-
sity Calendar.

The form must be submitted to
Information Services Office by
the ‘morning of the day before
the event is scheduled for inclu-
sion in "Today in the Univer-
sity“

“The forms only provide bet-

fA— greatly revised grad-

'for the College of Arts and
 Sciences (CAS) this fall. The
new plan, approved by the
‘Faculty of Arts and Sciences
' (FAS) on April 9, features a
5--unique credit-no entry sys-
— tem.

  Starting this month, CAS
 ﬁtudents will have the option of
taking as many courses as they
fjwish on the credit-no entry ba-
sis. Credit for a course will be
i awarded if “at least satisfactory”
work is done; otherwise, no men-
.tion of the course will be made
7 on the student’s transcript.

' The A;F letter grade system
;.will be retained as-the student’s
_-Bother option.

A The purpose of the new sys-
tem is to encourage students to
take courses in unfamiliar areas
1 without having to_ worry about
;-getting bad grades. Courses
‘taken. under credit-no entry do
gnotfcount in the Quality Point
-Average (QPA).

students is to be protected;

Therefore be it enacted that

(1) Each student shall have
aitranscript recording all grades
in which credit is awarded.

(2) There shall be twﬁ op-
tions for evaluations that must
be entered on the transcript: (A)
The Letter Grade System, and
(B) The Credit-No Entry Sys-
tem.

(A) Letter Grades shall be as
follows:
: Superior attainment; 
2 ‘Meritorious attainment;
: Satisfactory work;
: Barely cofnpetent work;
: Failure to do work of even
minimal competence;
: Work incomplete, for rea-
sons beyond the student's
control;
I: Work
T research inprogress;
N: Non-credit, audit; and
W: Withdrawal from course
with no penalty and no
credit.

(B) The Credit-No Entry
Grade shall be as follows;

S: Credit awarded for at least
satisfactory work done in course.
No entry shall be made for less
than satisfactory work done in
course. Courses for whish an S
is‘ received are not counted in
QPA.

G: Work incomplete. for rea-
sons beyond the student’s con-
trol.

(4) Subject to the restrictions
provided in paragraph eight,
there shall be no numerical limit
to the number of courses a stu-
dent may elect to take on a Cre-
dit-No Entry Basis.

(5) Students shall decide by
the end of the add period two
weeks after classes begin) which
grading system they wish to use

in" a given course. This decision
may not be changed, nor may a
grade of one kind awarded for a
course be replaced by a grade
of the other kind for that course.

grades of A. B, C. D, or F inat
-least 12 credits during the term
for which the List is published.
The criteria for actual inclusion
on the List shall be established
by the Dean of CAS.

(7) While no student can be
refused the option of taking any
course on a Credit-No Entry

Basis, departments may‘ feel that

some of their courses are of such
a nature that they should not be
graded on the letter-grade system.
In such cases, departments, may

with- the agreement of the in-’

structor teaching the course, re-
quest permission from CASC to
give the course solely on a Cred-
it-No Entry Basis.

(8) Departments shall have the
option of deciding which cours-
es required for a major, if any,
may be taken on a Credit-No
Entry Basis. Since one major
purpose. of the Credit-No Entry
System is to encourage students
to investigate’ disciplines with
which they are unfamiliar, CAS
Council strongly urges depart-
ments to allow some freedomon

wish to major in a given depart-
ment should not be discouraged

have made no genuine progress
toward mastering the discipline.

cording evaluations shall be es-
tablished to supplement the man-
datory transcript. This method
shall be called the Portfolio
Method. Each student shall be
encouraged to accumulate a vari-
ety of kinds of evidence of aca-
demic and personal growth and
achievement, e.g.; samples of

academic work such as term
_papers,. reports of experiments.

paintings, or records of musical
performances; evaluations by
various members of the academic
community, or by employers and
others who may know the stu-
dent well, etc. The student shall

plete control he shall have over

cript. The CAS shall offer as
much aid as it can to students
in maintaining portfolios.

faculty members to award grades
to each individual student on
the basis of the work done by
that individual in that course in
accordance with the evaluation
options provided

Housing Woes Plague Pitt

The University housing office
is feverishly at work in an attempt
to house between 30 and 60 dis-
placed freshman men. ‘

According to John Vrana, direc-
the
shortage is a result of the over-
projected size of the freshmen
class.

Twenty-three students are tem-
porally residing at the Ruskin
apartments until Sept. 7, when

they will move into the Hotel Web- ‘

ster Hall. Because accommoda-
tions at the Ruskin apartments
were unfurnished, the housing of-
fice underwent a “frenzied"

-search for rented beds. lamps.
desks. and other furniture.

One of Vrana’s chief concerns
is that those students indefinitely
housed at Webster Hall “will still
feel part of campus life.” He
feels, however, that the adjust-
ment will be abetted by thefact
that the rooms are air-condition-
edand have private baths and col-
or televisoion.

The housing office hopes.
though, that after an inventory of
returning resident students has
been taken, there will be suffi-
cient vacancies to accommodate
all students on campus.

Despite political differences.
the four major women‘s groups
in the city are drawing strength
from a common goal. liberation of
females from socially assigned
roles.

Perhaps the strongest and most
durable of the women’s liberation
organizations is the National Or-
ganization for ‘Women (NOW). It
is distinguished from other sects
in that its enrollment includes a
few" masculine names. although
membership is predominantly fe-
male.

NOW operates on a traditional
hierachical basis, employing stan-'
dard offices and the committee

good part of the responsibility for
the House passage of the Equal

all laws and regulations that deal
with men and women in a sepa-
rate fashion.

tion and direction is the Pitts-

President Ina Braden, have been
“successful” in compelling Chan-

a favorable reaction from Univer-

Dr. Braden. however. considers
the victory "slugging rather‘than

Program Revamped

Mentors Innovate O

by BOB GIN G
News Editor

The Mentor Program has taken
on a very new appearance this
year.

The idea behind the program
was explained by a member of the
Mentor Program Steering Com-
mittee. Gil Kleinerman. The new
program will revolve around
groups of 15 different people "who
normally wouldn't have met each

other and gotten togehter."

“It’s people,” according to
Kleinermah, “getting oriented to
people. People getting together,
just to get together is the essence
of the program.” The lexibility
of the program is unlimited, he

__ went on. “lt’s the most ambiguous

thing that can happen.”

The role of the mentor was ex-
plained. the mentor being only a
member of the group, and not
really an authority figure, as in
the past. “The only thing special
about the mentor. is that his
prime interest is getting the group
together."

Each mentor group will be com-
posed of a male and a female men-
tor, and will have the same

nnnce

McDonald’s

 m

amount of guys and girls. One
member of the committee sug-
gested that the mentor program
was an ideal way to become
acquainted with members of the
opposite sex.

The activities of the mentor
groups will be up to the individual
groups with larger groups getting
togehter from time to time“. for
special activities.

This past weekend. the mentors
all participated in a mentor train-
ing program geared at preparing
them for their role as part of a
group. One mentor pointed out,
though. that the mentors were not
acting as amateur psychologists.
but were mainly interested‘ in get-
ting people involved with other
people.

"The training .program was
aimed at creating and experienc-
ing a feeling of trust which you
can find in other people." he ex-
plained. “and trying to understand
the people around you."

It is the hope of the mentors
that they can relate the experi-
ence of their training program to
students who sign up for the men-
tor program. .

In order to attract more people
to the program. they have extend-
ed the registration period. and
have opened the program to up-
perclassmen as well as to the
freshman.

Links Peace, Justice

Center Probes Society

by ANN DORN

The peace movement today
takes as a standard a connection
between the war in Vietnam
and eiother social ills. But accord-
ing to English professor Marcia
Landy, chairman of the Peace
and Freedom Center, the Cen-
ter was one of the first peace
groups in Pittsburgh to see the
“conjunction between peace and
social justice. The organization
is at least six years old.

The Peace and Freedom Cen-
ter, not to be confused with the
Peace and Freedom Party, is
planning for this year several
community-oriented programs
following this general ideology.
“We’ll be examining ‘the role
of labor in the movement,”
explained Dr. Landy “and try-
ing to cement relations in the
union movement.” Two of the
Center’s methods. will be leaf-
leting plants and carrying on
conversations with members of

i the labor force.
“Only 25 percent of workers

are in unions,” noted Dr. Lan-
“The labor force isn’t a

monolithic structure.” For this
reason, the Center is planning

a labor workshop to include rank
and file members of unions in-
stead of only union representa-
tives.

The Center also has a women’s
group with about 29 or 30 mem-
bers whose initial concern was
scrutinizing the woman in so-
ciety. They have since begun to
establish a child care center for

. the community.

Starting this fall, the Center
will sponsor a draft resistance
counseling center on weekends.
It will also continue with its
regular programs of films and
lectures for the community,
publication of a newsletter,
and its role as’ a “clearing-
house plus” for the local move-
ment groups.

Dr. Landy described the Cen-

ter, located at 5530 Penn Ave.,
as an “umbrella for all groups

_ which initiates and supports ac-

tion.” It has no one ideology,
and operates by contribution.
With its mailing list of over
6,000 the Center is also a medium
for communication within the
Pittsburgh peace movement. “The
Center reaches the black com-
munity and the labor movement

. . it extends beyond the Uni-
versity community and beyond
young people.”

An organization that attempts
to relate to the community like
the Center is at one time or an-
other going to be involved with

iﬂhe mass media and its coverage

of the events it sponsors. Dr.

_Landy voiced strong views on

‘the subject of the press. She
blamed the news media with
"Selective reporting” and “cre-
ating an atmosphere of abnor-
mality” around the peace move-
ment. “When reporters cover a
demonstration,” she said, “they
ask if there are any police, if
l't’s orderly or if there will be
any violence. They’re not inter-
ested in substantive issues and
in what’s geing said and done.”

One of the first fall programs
the Center is helping to spon-
sor is a lecture the evening of

Commuters Activate A

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Fall term looks promising
this year for the previously
alienated Pitt commuters. In
response to the detached feel-
ing which many commuters
have, the Commuter Association
(CA) is currently devising a pro-
gram designed to assimilate
commuters into the general, on-
campus, student population.

A commuter social committee,
which will set within the Stu-
dent Government and the Stu-
dent Union Board, has been form-
ed as an organ of the CA. This
group will concern itself with
commuter activities, among
which are movies on the Cathed-
ral lawn, dances and parties, the
Activities Fair, and Homecom-
ing.

To ease the transportation dif-
ficulties faced by the commut-
ers, CA will publish a series of
newsletters concerning the avail-
ability of parking and bus
schedules.»_Transit shelters for
bus passengers should be con-
structed by December, and a

The CA also hopes to improve_
its organization by compiling an

accurate list of all commuters
It is hoped that the commute
questionnaire which was in
cluded with the academic in
voice will provide the informa
tion necessary for this project.

is very optimistic about the fu
ture for the commuters.

...applied many of the standard pro-
. cedures used in past years in de-
 termining the sum each group was
” to get but had varied in the areas
of concerts and speakers.

have a group plan a concert up
' to $7,000,” she said, “anticipat-
’ ing that they could make the rest
by selling tickets’ and other

-means.” .
" - She ‘said the committee also
‘earmarked" money for different
,,organizations to bring speakers
‘ onto the campus; so if the speak-
"er didn't show up, the organiza-
T tion would immediately forfeit the

fmoney. _
 Another member of the commit-
‘- tee, Patrick McGunagle, said that

the group had the most trouble
‘determining allocations for the
groups with the largest budgets
-and to which there policies didn’t
'.apply like some publications and
.-governing bodies.

 , He mentioned that the commit-
.. tee because of policy did not fund
 budgetary deficits, organizational
 banquets, and personal items.

 The committee funded a four
*"" dollar per person per day maxi-
mum meal allotment, "in group and
individual travel expenses, and
fonly provided for funds tocover
éyouth rate plane fares for air-
‘gplane travel. A

‘ The eight students felt that only
‘one person should be sent to or-
‘ ganizational conventions this year
-because of large budgeting in that
area.

Before the committee research-
-_ed_,each organization’s budget, the
original request totaled more than
twice as much more than the allo-
 cations committee ended up fund-
 ing, but they attributed this to or-
 .. ganizations not 'carefully research-
_ing or thinking out what they real-
ly needed.

which were judged “self sustain-
ing” after the committee’s re-
search, McGunagle pointed out,

Slyman stressed the impor-

that this was one of their basic
concerns and that the eight dollar

Enrollment Increase

F rash

by SUE HOENSTINE

Despite a tuition increase and
the recent financial‘ crisis. there
are 110 more‘ freshmen enter-
ing Pitt this fall than in 1969.
According to Dr. John G. Wilkins.
assistant director of admissions.
the fact that Pitt has not been
plagued with violence. Pitt's ur-
ban setting. and wide curriculum
offerings have helped increase
Pitt's’ attractiveness to freshmen
and their parents.

- Wilkins pointed out.that the em-
phasis on a liberal arts education
that does not concentrate on~busi-
ness. the engineering and nursing
programs, and the newly estab-
lished programs in the health-re'-
lated professions have also con-
tributed to the expanded enroll-
ment of the freshman class.

Of the 2.150 freshmen pre-

sently enrolled for the fall term.
56 per cent are from Al-
legheny County. There is an in-
crease of four percent in the num-
‘ber of freshmen enrolled from
=other parts of Pennsylvania and a
one per cent decreasétli the num-
ber of first year out-of-state stu-
dents. Housing difficulty and the
high out-of-state tuition combined
to produce the drop in out-of-state
enrollment.

Final tabulations of SAT scores
have not yet been completed for
CAS students. The overall scores
for entering engineers is 544 Ver-
bal and 622 Math. as compared

G '
to last yeaﬁsengineering scores
of 547 Verbal and 641 Math.
Nursing students in the class of

1974 had Verbal and Math
scores of 544.

The SAT scores for -nurses in
last year's freshmen class were
553 Math and 549 Verbal. Admis-
sion statistics do not include in-
ternational students. those in-
cluded in the minority and poverty
programs. transfers. and stu-

dents assigned to regional cam-
puses.

Events Revealed  

by NANCY RUTHER

The Student Government ac— ,

tivities calendar is available in
the Student Union lobby as the
first wave of publicity for vari-

ous campus organizations spon-.

soring a myriad of events.

Miss Harriet Friday, assistant
director of Special Program-
ming, expanded on the listing at
an interview on Aug. 31. The
Student Union Board (SUB) kicks
off the term with Cool Hand Luke
as the first in their series of Fri-
day night films in the Common
Facilities building on Sept. 4.
All students will be admitted with
their ID cards and 25¢.

The SUB also sponsors a social
that Saturday, the fifth. Any col-
lege‘ ID, plus one dollar, will suf-
fice for admission, but with a Pitt
ID a student needonly part with
50¢.

The Center for Latin American
Studies will follow suit with an-
other film series scheduled for
8:15 p.m. on Wednesday nights.
The recurring topiewill be the
emerging giant, Brazil, with sev-
eral plunges into such topics as
Yugoslavia and Japan.

Commemotating the end of
World War II, Hiroshima-Nagasa-
ki 1945, will be-shown under the
auspices of ‘the SU Public Affairs
Committee. Dr. Ernest Stern-
glass, professor of Radiology and
Physics at Pitt, will lead a discus-
sion on the film. According to

Miss Friday, “Dr. Sternglass has ,

appeared before various commit-
tees of Congress and is well vers-
ed in‘ the field of atomic energy,
its use and misuse.”

.On Sept. 14, the Revolutionary
Socialists Union will open its film
series on reform in the U.S. with
the double feature, Paris in the
Monthiof May and Richmond Oil
Strike. These films may be view-
ed in the SU Ballroom from 8-11
p.m.

- will

The week of Sept. 14 will bring
with it the first of many concerts.
The Council on the Arts (COTA)
features Tommy Lee and Eric
Kloss, a jazz saxaphonist, at
Frick Fine Arts on the 17th.

The Student Government has
scheduled its first concert of the
month for September on the 19th.

A defendant of the Chicago Sev-
en, Leonard Weinglass, will de-
bate Phillip Abbott Luce on Sept.
21 at 7:30 pm. in the Common
Facilities. The Student Union Pub-
lic Affairs Committee and the
Young Americans for Freedom
are co-sponsoring this debate in
an effort to bring out two points
of view. .

The fourth film series, organiz-
ed by COTA, will allow the stu-
dents to view the ballet Romeo
and Juliet in its film production
starring Vargot Fonteyn and Ru-

.dolph Nureyev of the English Roy-

al Ballet. There is no charge.

Closing out the September cal-'
endar, Men’s Dormitory Council
and Associated Women Students
(AWS) will stage the annual Ac-
tivities Fair in the SU Ballroom
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sept.
28,29.

October will see the contin-
uance of the September events
and also the rise of a political bar-
rage. In the first three weeks the
AWS Public Affairs Committee
introduce major guberna-
torial and senatorial candidates.

A series of experts on the cam-
paign issues will be featured in
the last week. As Miss Friday
said, “This will enable the stu-
dents to evaluate the candidates
stands in light of what the experts
say.” ‘ "

Tradition will hold with Par-
ents’ Weekend on Oct. 2, 3, 4,
and, of course, Homecoming will
bring Judy Collins to the Syria
Mosque on Oct. 15.

Dean. Views Bureaucracy

by LEE TERKEL
Staff Writer

Dr. Charles Montgomery has

' recently assumed the post of Dean
of ‘Student Development. The of-

fice, a product of organizational
reshuffling, was created by the
University with the aim of in-
creased administrative efficiency.

Dr. Montgomery commented,

“It is my responsibility to see that
the tasks of the various organs

concerned with student affairs '
_ are carried out. In addition, I will
act as mediator between these or-

gans and the Assistant Chancellor
in the negotiations of resources
and the planning of programs.”

The Dean expects to lend his as‘-
sistance to many areas of student

affairs, e.g., Orientation, the Men— _

tor Program Community Rela-

tions, the Abortion Program, Fra-t

ternities and Student Govern-
ment. His office will be called
upon to help deal with major. stu-

dent-administration crises that

arise during the coming year.

Montgomery emphathizes with
the people who have tried to deal
with the University’s bureaucra-
tic behemoth. He strongly be-
believe that administrative sui-
cide would be the result if such
structures were eliminated.

Clearly, the monster cannot be-‘

slain—it must be tamed.

ministrative inefficiency.

He pinpointed a number of
causes: “People manning admin-
istrative posts are often ignorant
of the proper interpretation of
guidelines and make incorrect de-
cisions. They tend to refer the
more ambiguous cases to other

‘offices to avoid the extra paper-

anther Camp Ends
ith Many Bruises;

By ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

After the Pitt football team's first scrimmage of the fall (?)
last Saturday at Allegheny College. Carl DePasqua was his typical.

cautious self.

“Don't say too many good things about us." the Panther head
coach warned. “We‘ve got a lot of things to work on.“

That was last Saturday. On Monday the Panthers held their
second scrimmage. closing their stay at the Meadville. Pennsylvania
school. And the session revealed why a coach like DePasqua is

never overly optomistic.

The first scrimmage was high-_
lighted by sparkling perform-
ances by the Pitt rushers, sup-
posedly the Cats’ strongest group
of athletes. The defense took

over Monday, but not because of_

a poor exhibition by the top men
in the offensive backfield. ~

The Panthers‘ first three full-
‘backs and top three halfbacks

all missed action Saturday. The
fullbacks—Tony Esposito. Phil
Sgrignoli, and Lou Julian—were
slightly injured. Dave Garnett
and John Moss, a pair of half-
backs running behind Denny
Ferris. were also injured.

pﬂogan Presses Havern

Tim Hornish, the top receiver
in Saturday’s scrimmage, and
last year’s number one pass
catcher, Steve Moyer, also were
absent from the final drill at
Allegheny.

The Monday drill was cut
short because of the mishaps, and
despite the domination of the
defense. DePasqua admits that
the offense held the upper hand
at camp.

“The defense has a lot of
rough edges to be ironed out,"
he said. “We need better disci-
pline."

To" work on the discipline,
DePasqua needs a few more
healthy men than he had when
the squad returned to Pittsburgh
for their first workout on the
new AstroTurf at the Stadium on
Tuesday.

Roaming between the ‘offen-
sive and defensive groups on
Tuesday afternoon, DePasqua
saw head trainer Willie Myers.
and the coach‘s patience with
the injuries let loose for. a few
seconds.

“We've got to get some guys
in pads. Will." he said, approach-
ing the trainer. “How many we
got out?. I counted about
twenty."

“It’s about that,” Myers an-
swered.

Myers mentioned later that
the count was closer to fifteen.
which was still high enough to
limit hitting for a day or two.

Few of the injuries were very
serious. and contact has resumed.
Such drills will soon begin to
tell who‘s going to win starting
positions for the Panther opener
against UCLA. September 19.

One of the more interesting
battles for a starting berth-—at
least the one that will attract
fan attention—is the struggle be-
tween junior Dave Havern and
sophomore John Hogan at quar-
terback.

Before goingvto Meadville.
DePasqua said that the top sig-
nal calling job was Havern's
and that Hogan would have to
take the .job from the confi-
dent No.17.

Hogan had an impressive camp.
including two touchdown passes

Some Seclusion In Late

 

By ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

With its green expanse and the colonial archi-
_tecture the Allegheny College campus is beauti-

ful, to say the least. in late August.

Alumni of the Meadville. Pennsylvania" school
will tell you that the Reverand Timothy Alden.
kin" of a Revolutionary War major. founded the
institution in 1815 with the intent of introducing
a liberal arts education beyond the borders of
_the New England states. But it seems that Alden
could have been thinking of the modern day Pitt

football teams.

Despite its scenic appeal, Allegheny during
the final days of August is dull. empty, remote-
and any other degrading adjective you want to

attachto it.

This is, however, ideal for a college grid camp
setting. Seclusion is practically a necessity. When
there’s nothing else tempting the mind, its easier

- for everyone to think football. A team spirit can
develop from living together—particularly if the
togetherness is away from just about everything
else. That’s why most college grid teams gather
at a suburban motel on the eve of home football

games.

 Grid   Squad Adjusting

 To Stadium’s Traction

 

For that first week of preparation for the sea-

’ son Allegheny College is seclusion that‘s not too
far away from home for the Panthers. A walk ‘
among the trees. buildings, and rocks that are
dedicated to either the Civil War dead or to the
Class of ‘33 doesn't reveal many new faces at
this time of the year. A few, but not many.

coat.

Some players were wishing it were the Mon-
day of breaking camp as early as the- Monday
they arrived in Meadville. By the week-end there -.
weren't many of the temporary residents of Bald- '
win —Hall (the dorms where the team stayed) who
weren‘t anxious to get home.

A couple two-hour drills per day in the hot
sun at Robertson Field and awakening daily at
7 a.m. could be handled by the athletes who were,

‘ for the most part, in great physical condition. ,
But that seclusion -— a reason for such a camp?— ; =:
can become unbearable. ‘

Denny Ferris should know. [The Panther tail- .' ‘

Mike Bannan was anxious to step into a gaping hole in the
Panther defensive backfield. Unfortunately, he has stepped right
outof Head Football coach Carl DePasqua's 1970 plans. ‘ I -

In spring dril1s,-DePasqua switched Bannan from cornerback
to inside safety to replace one of the two graduated inside safetys.
Now, De Pasqua is grooming a new man for the job all over again.

Bannan was hit by a baseball three weeks ago. His eye hemorr-
‘haged. and the doctors noticed another area of the eye which was

bleeding. The less revealing
bleeding disabled him. He suf-
fered a torn retina.

Specialists operated on the
retina August 25; and as a result,
he has been banned from any
strenuous physical activity for a
three month period.

“You have to take injuries in
stride." a resigned Bannan re-
marked.

“We’ve got many good players
who can do the job for us this
year,“ he commented. “Last
spring, our defensive backfield
looked a little shaky. Then, we
had a good spring and lots. of
enthusiasm." .

.DePasqua stated a few weeks
ago that “If you sometimes won-
der why I don't seem very opti-
mistic, you know why now. In-
juries are one of the intangibles.
Nobody can predict these things.

Bannan believes that many

good players are returning to help
the Panthers. Yet, he must feel

dejected not to be one of them.

Last year he again was tabbed
for a starting defensive back
role, and again injuty crushed
his personal goals in only the
season's second contest.

This past spring he toiled dili-
gently and learned the funda-

mentals of the inside safety. He

gained the confidence necessary

to handle the responsibility of.

limiting the oppositions rushing
attack.

Now he must satisfy himself
by contemplating next spring
and an injury-free 1971 season.
“There’s not much I can say,
except that I'll be ready for
spring,” he mentioned.

He and his teammates believed
that the club /was just beginning
to jell at the end of spring drills.

When any of the Panthers are

the typical reaction seems to be

sembling “It was a rotten break:
I know that we'll be all right,
though." An observer, however,
can not categorize the later sen-
tence as a hope or a conviction.

An intangible weakened the
Panther defensive backfield. The
caliber of that part of the squad
currently depends upon intan-
gibles——spirit and determination.

QBs Expected To
Boost F rash Team

V ‘The Pitt 1970 freshman football team has a bigger and bette1i.“'r’-J"

schedule and head coach‘Bill Quinter thinks Carl DePasqua‘s fall
camp plans for the varsity club will help the frosh.

DePasqua decided to take his four freshmen quarterbacks to
the Panther camp at Allegheny College, using the signal callers
as directors of the UCLA offense against Pitts varsity defense in‘

practice sessions.

The four quarterbacks—Rod Huth. Bob Medwid. Dan Rullo..
and Bob Veillette—learned alot about the way Pitt football is being

operated and will be expected to
lead their fellow frosh in drills.

The freshmen, unlike
year’s crop which played only
one game, have a full schedule
as far as frosh cards are con-
cerned. Tbeir four-game season
opens September 25 against the
West Virginia freshmen at Mor-
gantown, the Pitt frosh’s only
visitinggame.

 

Three home games form the
rest of the schedule. On Octo-

of athletes who were due in. Then they came.

_ “This is the largest group we have ever had." said Bemis. “We

Since fifty physicals do take up a little time. the veterans had

"Best High School Coach”
Joins PittTrackAnd Field Scene

By MIKE MILLER
Track coach Jim "Banner in-
sists on going first class-. When he
needs a new assistant"he, goes af-
~.,,ter no less than “the best high
" ‘school coach in the nation."

Don Mollenauer, former head
coach at Mt. Lebanon High
School, has been appointed as-
sistant track coach at the Uni-
versity.

Ba_nner‘s faith in his new as-
sistant is supported by Mollen-
auer’s coaching record, the best
in the United States.

He has compiled a phenomin-

al 217-27-2 record in dual-and
tri-meets in 32 years at Mt. Leb-
anon high school. In cross coun-
try his teams stood at 188-36-1.

In addition, he coached 144
consecutive wins between . 1944
and 1958, a national record.

Mollenauer began coaching
in 1932. Though he participated
in track in high school and let-
tered in college, his career as an
athlete was undistinguished.

ble. He will help out with fall
track practice and cross coun-
try. And during the regular

track season he will work with
the weight men.

As far as other coaching posi-
tions on, the collegiate level,
Mollenauer reported, "I never
sought one. In the 1940s there
was a movement by Cornell
alumni to get me to coach there,
but it fell through."

The new coach has some re-'
grets about leaving his former
position.

“It was not an easy decision
to make,” said Mollenauer. “Af-
ter being associated with Mt. Le-
banon High School for 32 years,
I can’t help experiencing some
emotional trauma.”

His home sickness, however,
might be slightly relieved by the
presence of three of his former
athletes. Mike Nolan, Steve Hein
and Dave Szabat, members of
Banner’s squad, began their car-
eers under Mo11enauer’s tutelage
at Mt. Lebanon.

Mollenauer feels that his role
as assistant coach will be alittle
different from his previous posi-
tion.

“I hope I can adapt,“ he said.
“I have a very high regard for
Mr. Banner, both as a coach and
as a man. I hope I’ll be able to
work with him to advantage."

Mollenauer will be replacing
Jack Shaw, who left Pitt for a
position as head coach at West-
ern Michigan University.

The new comers were a little
more tense as new friendships
had to be made, and there were
new people to meet.

-The Field House locker room
area was a mass of bodies-some
laying on the floor some jumping
on and off the scales, some wait-
ing for their equipment. Two
were fast asleep on cots, and
others just stood around, looking
bored with the whole thing. On
the floor there was a wrestling

‘match going on while others

looked on. “Gee,” stated a hope-
ful, “I’m already having trouble.
I can’t open my locker’ ’.

A few other problems arose.
“Mr. Bemis, am I going to get

shoes?" one asked. “Yes", Bemis

assured, will

shoes".

“everyone get

“I. wonder if he will make
cuts," one whispered to another.
“I don’t know”. “You know. fif-
ty guys is a lot of guys".

By this-time everyone was set-
t-led. Bemis called for everyone’s
attention, as he prepared to lay
down the law.

A grunt and a groan met his
remarks. “No one is permitted
to smoke, or drink. You must be
in shape and be able to run the
mile in no more than 7 minutes."

A ‘few questions were asked.
“If there are no more questions
we will see you tomorrow at
ten o‘clock." After the ten o’clock
session which would last until
noon the team would again meet
at 2 "pm. for another two-hour

~ session.

Bemis seemed satisfied. He had
lost only three athletes through
graduation, and among the rest
he had talent from South Ameri-
ca and Asia, as well as from
other parts of the United States.

"We should have a pretty de-
cent team". he said. "Yeah. I
know a lot of these guys look
pretty good . . Yeah. they do.
See you tomorrow." .

Panthers Play Dukes
In Steel Bowl Opener

By BILL NAAB
Associate Sports Editor

Pitt and Duquesne basketball squads have finally been stacked
against another. The Pittsburgh Post Gazette’s Dapper Dan Organi-
zation altered the format of the annual Steel Bowl basketball tour-
ney and thereby pronounced the Panthers and Dukes as first night

opponents.

In the past, the local rivals only met if both either won or lost

their first game encounters. The
reason,.of course, for the policy

. change is the presence of the

mighty champions from the West
Coast, UCLA. The Dapper Dan
Organization felt that the con-
frontation of Pittsburgh’s best
quintet against the national
champions would be a fitting
climax to the Steel Bowl. The
Bruins will meet William &
Mary in the other first round
contest. The winners and losers
will then pair-off the following

evening.

In another swerve from the
routine. the tourney will be
played the last weekend of De-
cember instead of the first or
second weekend. Thus, UCLA’s
visit will coincide with their
trip East. Similar dates will also
be announced for next year’s
Steel Bowl; thereafter, the

dates will correlate to those of -

previous years.

Throughout the past winter,
roundball buffs were pleading
for Pitt-Duquesne match-ups
throughout the following seasons.
No progress, however, seemed

._- ._§>.pparent.

“We were willing to go along
with the Dapper Dans," Panther
Coach Buzz Ridl remarked. “It's
a good attraction. Alot of people
wanted to see the teams on one
another’s schedule."

The Panthers‘ participation in
this year's Steel Bowl follows an
array of rumors and confusion.

11th Games
Slated For

Grid Future

Athletic Director Casimir Mys-
linski has added 11th games to
the Pitt Football schedules for
-3,973 and 1979. The Panthers will

V travel to the University of Geor-

gia on Sept. 15, 1973, and then
host the University of Kansas on
Sept. 15, 1979. It will mark the
first meeting ever for the Pan-
thers with Georgia or. Kansas.

J
I

Three years ago, Pitt accepted
an invitation to appear in this
winter’s Madison Square Garden
Holiday Festival in late Decem-
ber.

Shortly afterwards, the Dap-
per Dans lassoed UCLA for this
winter, and the Bruins could not
accept an early December play-
ing date. Therefore, since the
Panthers were committed at that
time and also treated victory as

though it was an evil course,’

Penn State was rumored as pro-
bable substitute.

Since Buzz Ridl’s reign as
coach, however, the Panthers
have rejected their invitation to
the celebrated Holiday Festival.
Yet, once Pitt had jumped back
into the Steel Bowl picture. no
more was said about Penn State's
participation. Why was William
& Mary chosen as the tourna-
ment’s fourth team instead of
the Nittany Lions? No one seems
to have a definite answer.

Walt Cummins, Pitt Assistant
Athletic Director. said, “Maybe
Penn‘ State already made tourna-
ment committments before tour-
nament arrangements were fin-
alized. We play them twice dur-
ing the season anyway. We don’t
really care to play them more
often."

Whatever the case, an attrac-
tive tournament won‘t be even
more attractive to local fans.

 

Western Pennsylvania Confer-
ence Championship.

What complicates Fauzey‘s
attempt to retain the crown is
the lack of returning lettermen.
As things now stand Fauzey can
-look forward to the return of
only seven lettermen_ from last
year‘s championship club.

Gone are such sharpshooters
as last year’s team captain, MVP
and high scorer (a season aver-
ageof 267 out of a possible 300)
John Taucher II and Mike Sim-
odejka, whose 259 was third best
on the team. Both are now in the
U.S. Army as Second Lieutenants
stationed at Ft. Benning, Geir-

gia, with Mike leaving for Deut-_

scheland ‘later this month.

Also lost to graduation were
Dick Birchbickler (254), Tom
Lyons (243). Mary McFeeley
(240), the lone co-ed on the club,
and Chuck Haley (233), who also
doubled as the team’s equipment

- manager.

Another problem is that last
year’s squad included only one
freshman and to this date no new
frosh have been recruited. This
may be largely attributed to

Co-eds In
4 Sports

Co-eds at Pitt have the oppor-
tunity to participate ‘on four var-
sity teams this year. Field hock-
ey, speed swimming, gymnas-
tics, and tennis are the sports
that the girls will be competing
in against other area universi-
ties.

Miss Burnstein is the coach
_of the women’s field hockey team
and it will practice every Mon-
day, Tuesday, and Wednesday
from 4-6 P.M. during the months
of September and October. Mrs.
Grindle’s speed swimming team
will meet Monday through Thurs-
day from 4:30 to 6:00 P.M. The
organizational meeting for the
mermaids will be Sept. 10 at
4:30 P.M.

The gymnastics team will prac-
tice every Monday through
Thursday from 4-6 in the after-
noon under the guidance of Miss
Santillo.

The first meeting of the ten-
nis squad under Dr. Edwards is
not scheduled yet. but anyone in-
terested should check with the
Physical Education office.

Sign ups for all teams are tak-
ing place next week at Trees
Hall on the activity board. or

tacting the Women’s Phys. Ed.

Rookie Coach Fauzey
Aims For Riﬂe Crown

By STEVE zvcn

What to do for an encore with half the band gone? This seems
to be the problem that confronts the new varsity rifle coach Sgt.
Bill Fauzey. a twenty year veteran of the U,S. Army and the father
of three girls. who will be hard put to top or even match the 11-3
record of last year’s amazing rifle squad which —— under the tutelage
of Sgt. Sarver (now in the Republic of Korea)—tied Indiana for the

R.O.R.C.’s loss of credit upon
whose ranks last year's squad re-
lied heavily. In fact. two thirds
of the members of last year‘s
team were enrolled in the R0.
T.C. program at Pitt.

Of the seven returning letter-
men only two—Larry La Spada
(senior) of Sewickley and Dennis
Glaus (junior) of Pleasant Hills-
are still in R.0.T.C. Other re-
turning upperclassmen include
senior Bill Crooks of Fox Chapel,
juniors Bruce Barrett (Dormont),
John Mihealsick (Allenport),
Paul Oblack (Valencia) and so-
phomore sensation Dan McGrew
whose 263 average as a freshman
last year was second only to
team captain John Taucher’s 267.

Fauzey will hold his first meet-
ing on Friday September 18 at
the team’s base of operations —
Trees Hall Rifle Range. and an-
other one the following Friday
prior to the opening match
against St. Francis, a non-league
opponent. The marksmen will
begin defense of their crown on
October 5 at Geneva.

SGT. BILL SARVER
Ex-Rifle Coach

Anyone interested in coming
out for the team in any capacity
(e.g. shooter. scorer or manager)
should attend the meeting on
September 18 at Trees Hall or
contact Coach Fauzey at either
extension 264 or 265 anytime
between the hours of 8:00 a.m.
and 3:30 p.m., Monday through
Friday.

Practices will be held three
times a week at Trees Hall. The
specific nights will be decided
at the meeting on the 18th.

  Battle Of
 The Sexes

By BILL NAAB
Associate Sports Editor

   
 

 

The shape of things to come in intramural activities
could be extremely pleasant. ~ .

For certain, guys who play intramural (IM) sports will
e concerned with shapes of things other than the ball.
‘Females have finally achieved equality with men'—-at least

1n_IM volleyball, basketball, tennis, and badmitton.

Another fall novelty occurs when women and men com-
bine physical education classes. Leo Bemis, Intramural Dir-
ector, and Dadette (Dee) Bernstein, a member of the wom-
n’s physical education department, have collaborated to
ould the co-ed program. Bemis does not confess to be a
ember of Women’s Liberation, yet he does mention, “I’.ve
always wanted to do this.”

While freshmen guys were peeking at girls’ gym class-
." es through the door which separated the skirts from the
nts, Bemis attempted to crack a few antiquated atti-
tudes.

“There used to be a feelingthat men’s and Women’s

activities didn’t mix,” he said. “It was also believed that

women should notbe involved in competitive sports. They

..now participate in intercollegiate swimming, basketball,
and gymnastics.” ’

the school of liberal arts, Bemis hopes that the co-ed struc-

ure will attract more individuals to Trees Hall.

  

Bemis has mentioned that a rigidformat hasn’t been
stablished. He, seems to be awaiting student reaction to
he crashed sex barrier within the phys-ed department. He
has indicated that volleyball, tennis, basketball, and bad-
mitten can all be taught in mixed gym classes and can also
be tossed into a special co-ed intramural division. How-

ver, he has also pointed out that students are free to or-
anize and suggest additional teams.

Women now have the opportunity to prove that they

other hand, probably won’t really be too concerned about

Denise Longs, however, are about as rare as are Ralp

Hopes Need Summers

By ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

There aren't many students around the Pitt campus during the
summer months. And when everybody returns in the fall lost of
conversation deals with how the summer months were spent.

Some friends of George Medich might be surprised to learn
that the ex-Pitt baseball and football player earned money as a pro-
fessional baseball player under a New York Yankee organization con-

tract this summer.

It’s not that Medich wasn't expected _to be sought by a major

league team.. The fireballer

simply has made it no secret-
that his interest in medicine is“

strong, and that the lure could
end his professional athletic
desires.

With, the Yankees, Medich

“Let’s say it’s a lot closer than
DePasqua re-
vealed, not committing himself
to a decision. “Hogan’s put addi-
tional pressure on Havern.”

Willie Saloky, who reported to
camp with his weight down and
in good shape for opening of
drills, injured his knee during
drills and is the most severe of
the minor injuries reported. . .
"There were some major injuries

Joe McCain, injured over a

game, was declared out again
this season. He missed both base-

A strange accident in camp was

a baseball and a medical ca-

__reer. At worst, he'll set aside

the bass and glove in two years
and concentrate solely on medi-
cine.

“I’ll play baseball the next

"two summers and go to Med

School here at Pitt," Medich
said the other day., just prior
to beginning his medical edu-
cation at the graduate level.
“By then I'll know if I can go
anywhere in baseball and I’ll
decide about going to spring
training."

If the mound future looks
bright for the former Panther
pitcher he will arrange his
medical education around the
career, with the liklihood of
attending the Cornell Medical
School. If the picture is bleak,

.he says he will return to Med

school at Pitt and watch base-
ball games from the grand-

. stands only.

Can Medich succeed in base-

‘ball?

The possibility is definitely
in existence. He broke into the
pro ranks with a good 3-1 record
at Oneonta. New York, the
Yanks’ Rookie club.

His wins were all three-hit-
ters. as he quickly became the
Summer league team’s "top
moundsmen. After that perfor-
mance the Yanks promoted Me-
dich to their Class AA team in
Manchester, New Hampshire.

Medich was not as successful
in his first taste of Eastern
League action.

  
      

§ \ \n

GEORGE MEDICH
As Pitt Hurler

He left the Manchester team
a few days before the end of
the season to return to school,
and when he left he took an em-
barassing 0-5 record with him.

Listening to Medich. one re-
alizes that he isn't embarrased
by his Manchester performances.

“I pitched some good base’.-/'

ball,” he says. .“The league’s
a lot tougher. The hitting is real
good. And I was surprised that
the defense wasn’t that good.”

Considering his won-loss
marks in the two leagues this
summer Medich could easily
have preferred to remain in the
Rookie league for the summer".
Especially since he and his
wife (of two and one-half

months). Donna, were forced to 

move from Oneonta to Man-
chester after only one month's
residence in the New York town.

“We just got settled down in
Oneonta and had to move
again." Medich said. “But I'm_
glad I went up there (to Man-
chester). There were a lot of
ex-major leaguers there, or guys
who you know will make it."

Don’t Bother
-To Keep Off
I The Grass

By BARRY SIMON

This fall the Panthers will take to an all new field — _Astro-Turf.
It‘s ‘hard to believe that just_ four years ago there wasn‘t one out-
door —AstroTurf athletic field in the world. Now the number of out-

door fields approaches 40.

This AstroTurf story began in the late 1950‘s. That was when
the Monsanto Company, a science-based Corporation in St. Louis.
started man‘s first investigation intosynthetic turf for sports and re-

creation. They foresaw that a
population growing at an almost
explosive rate. with more free
time for recreation. would soon
be putting tremendous strain‘
upon available natural turf re-
creation areas.

Monsanto set up ‘special’ lab-
oratory facilities at Decatur.
Alabama: In 1964. the first "syn-
theticturf sports field went onto
a field house floor at Moses
Brown School in ‘Providence. R.
I.

In 1966, AstroTurf went into
the Astrodome in Houston, Tex-
as. First in the infield. Then into
the outfield area: The success of
this famous installation is taken
with hardly a second thought to-‘
day. Monsanto was still improv-
ing AstroTurf to meet the great-
est test — the Outdoors.

In 1967. the first ‘two athletic
fields made by man went into
play. These fields are doing
beautifully‘ today at Indiana State
University and Seattle Memorial
Stadium.

Many changes and ‘ improve-
ments have been made in Astro-
Turf. For example. the original
Astrodome surface had 32 ounc-
es of nylon face fiber per square

_yard and no shock-absorbing pad.

Todays AstroTurf field has 45
ounces of nylon per square yard
of surface and a five-“eights inch
thick pad bonded underneath.
Multi-sports pro stadiums - have
even a stronger AstroTurf.

Meanwhile, back in the labe in
Decatur, Monsanto research peo-
ple continue their fascinating
tests: Ball bounce, impact ab-
sorption, ultra-violent light ma-
chines, shoe torture tests, drain-
age capability and more. The re-
search and testing already in-
vested an AstroTurf gives it per-
formance above__ comparison and

A _ reliability “almost "beyond ques-

tion

ed rock base next to the soil.
This is then topped by a layer
of asphalt to assure proper grade
and drainage. Bonded to the as-
phalt is the" white shock-absorb-
ing pad which is bonded to the
AstroTurf itself. The AstroTurf
is put down in rolls 15 feet wide
and up to 200 feet long. The rolls
are usually scanned together on
the marking stripes. To either side
are the anchoring devices with
drainage tiles around them. Ex-
cellent drainage is achieved by
crowing (turtle back) the field
by some 14-18 inches. The ma-
terial is impervious to water.
and the crown. lower than with
many natural grass firlds. allows
the‘ water to drain off the sides
of the field.

AstroTurf permits good trac-
tion in below freezing weather.
Should a rain be followed by
freezing. the thin layer of ice
will break up easily and brush
off. The AstroTurf will give pro-
per traction. Snow is easily re-
‘moved.

Maintenance is at a minimum
with an AstroTurf field. An oc-
casional hosing down, washing
or vacuuming is usually enough.
Normal rainfall ‘helps keep As-
troturf clean. Striping is easy
and quick. Both temporary and
permanent lines may be put
down. Stains are easily removed
with detergent and water.

Of course one of the main rea-
sons for the AstroTurf is the
amount'of time it will be avail-
able during the day. Two exam-
ples of this is Nickerson Field at
Boston University and Memor-
ial Stadium in Seattle, Washing-
ton. Athletic Director Dr. Robert
Peck at B.U'. gets right to the
point. "Because of the premium

is

  about selecting diamonds?

TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE. IF YOU ANSWER ALL FIVE QUESTIONS RIGHT, YOU’RE AN EXPERT.

1. The finest diamonds are
c A. White B. Slightly yellow C. Blue-white
D. Colorless

2. When a diamond’s clarity isnot marred by any scratch,
spot, cloud or other blemish, the gem can properly be
described as g ‘

A. "Ideal” C. “Flawless”

3. When professionals refer to a diamond’s "cut” they mean

B. “Perfect”

A. Its general shape, such as round, oval, pear, marquise
or emerald. - '

..

B. The extent to which the angles and proportions of its
many sides, or facets, conform to the ideal for its par-
ticular shape. .

C. The diamond’s ability to scratch other hard surfaces,
such as glass or steel.

4. The value of a diamond is determined by its
A. Carat weight B. Cut C. Color

D. Clarity
E. Price ’

5. Aside from differences in the price ranges of various prod-
ucts, selecting a diamond is most like choosing
A. awatch B. Savings bonds C. a steak’ D. a new car

/'

Here’s bow to score your answers. (But
please. don't read any furt/oer until
you’ve answered all t/Je questions to
tbe best of your ability.)

 
   
      
   

\

lutely right. The finest diamonds have no \ / ‘ "\_ 

color of their own whatever. They merely blaze

If you checked “Blue-white,” be careful. The term
is fraught with many meanings _and loopholes. It is
used as a sales aid by some jewelers to help sell diamonds

. of inferior color. Because “blue-white” is inexact and mis-

lead-ing, we_ forbid the use of this term in referring to any
diamond at Hardy & Hayes.

2. If you checked "ﬂawless,” you're right again. A ﬂawless dia-
mond is not necessarily a “perfect” one, however. The Federal

-Trade Commission's ruling on the use of this term states that

besides being ﬂawless a diamond must not be of inferior color or
make. There really is no such thing as a “perfect” diamond.

Like the term "blue-white,” the term “perfect” is forbidden
at Hardy & Hayes. ' '

3. You are right if you chose answer  Diamonds are cut in
different styles, such as round, oval, etc. There are Ideal angles
and proportions for each style.

-When a professional refers to cut, he is talking.about the
human factor of a diamond’s beauty. Just how well has man done
his job? Ifgthe cutter deviates from the precise angles and propor-
tions of the Ideal, your diamond would have less beauty and
shouldftherefore cost you less than a more precise cut. ‘

4. If you chose any one of the four Cs, you're ‘partly right. A
diamonds value is determined by all four. -

The price you pay for a diamond includes-more than the value
of the gem itself; the value of the ring or other setting, for in-
stance. A portion of the seller’s cost of doing business also is in-

‘ .cluded, as is his proﬁt.

Because all Hardy & Hayes diamonds _are obtained directly,
via New York cutters, from the London sights of the Central
Selling Organization (marketing arm for all jewelry diamonds
in the world) our price does not include the profits and expenses
of intermediate brokers, wholesalers or agents. For this reason,

you often pay less at Hardy 8: Hayes than you would elsewhere

for a diamond of comparable quality.

Judge for yourself. We’ll give you a booklet* that explains
how the various characteristics of a "diamond are rated and
how the professionals compare one diamond with another. It's a

I hlm

mm

 
     
    

clearly written little booklet, easy to un-
derstand. We’ll answer any questions you
may have and, if you have time, show you
examples of the characteristics you’ll want to

l

/ watch for. '
f Then shop around.

5. Buying a diamond has something in common with all
four possible answers, of course. Watches and automobiles,
being manmade, can be standardized, however. You can usually
expect one new car to perform as well and ride as comfortab_ly as
another of the same make, model and equipment. But nature
never does anything quite the same way twice.

Savings bonds have but one variable—-—-their size, or dollar
value. You look at the denomination anduyou know what each
one’s worth. Not so a diamond. _

Selecting one is thus most like choosing a steak. No two are
quite alike. Price per pound (or carat) is only one of several
considerations. Color and clarity are as important in a diamond
as tenderness and flavor in a steak. And cut, certainly, is vital to
both. '

Of course, one way to be sure of getting a good steak is to go to
a good butcher. We'll spare you the rest of this analogy.

If you got four of tbe ﬁve questions rig/Jt, your /enowledge of
diamonds is above average. But even if you “missed only one, it
would be wise to ﬁnd out all you can about diamonds before
you actually invest in one. We’ll be delighted to /yelp you learn
as muc/9 as you care to. Don’t feel you'd be imposing. After all,
t/ye more you know about diamonds, t/9e better for .us.

. *If you would like us to mail the booklet to you at home, simply send‘ us

a postcard, giving your name and mailing address. We’ll send your
booklet the day we get your card.
