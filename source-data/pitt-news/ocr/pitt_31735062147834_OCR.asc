mu Will RE-OPEN
STUDENT RELIEF
   GAMPAIGN 

, Pirtt1will»begin a re-opening of the
campaign for the relief “of students
throughout the world on Friday, Mar-
ch 3, when seventy members of the
University faculty. and 1student body
will assemble in the University Cafe-
teria at 12:30 ooiclock to organize
and to initiate the campaign, which
willbe carried on among the students.
Other colleges are also aiding the
cause of world student friendship by
sacriﬁcial contributions. ; Pitt has so
far raised only one hundred seventy-
ﬁve dollars so that much more is
needed in this drive. ‘ .

. France, Switzerland, Austria, Hun-
gvary, Czechoslovakia,
other -eastern lands will be given
aid through the contributions equally
without discrimination 1=bet2W,een1race,
rank, or religion. ‘ , * . '

ber, says: “The new: year in student

play is a street in.ais'ixt‘eentxh centQury'—

manner of presentation are promised.
The play was ﬁnst presented before
the University -students in Cam-

ﬁeceived sufficient “information to in-

tribution of favors been perfect, no.

There were ‘three hundred twenty

committee and myself. To insure
the receipt of ya ﬂavor by each lady
attending the Prom, -instructions had
been issued to the Prom Committee
 only to limit the number of tick-
ets sold to 1;hree’Lhundred b also to
“tlsilstribute favors to those ho had

gore any were given to members of
 Prom tcommi-ttee. 'I‘«hat the first
instruction was not vi-olated is indi-
cated by the number of tickets taken
at the door. As for the secgon.d,,in-

Another ‘Areas-on_ advanced is that

Fraternities play an important part in the activities at Pitt these days. They take the place of the much
needed dormitories to PI'°Vido homes fol‘ many of the boys who otherwise would have to live in rather unat-
tractive boarding houses. They are looked on with favor by the University authorities, and rightly so. The his-
tory of some of the fraternities forms some mighty interesting reading, and it is the intention of the Alumni Editor
to publish some of the old pictures from time to time.

Fraternities were first started at Pitt during the civil war times, Phi Gamma Delta and Delta Tau Delta
being the two which were represented at the old Western University at that time.
both fraternities to be abolished, but they were revived in recent yearsand have flourishin chapters at Pitt. _

Recently Walter E. Burtt, Ex. '00, furnished" us the above picture of the old Sigma Alpha fraternity, which
was very active in the College and Engineering departmants of W. U. P. 23 years ago. It was such a good looking
crowd, and contained the faces of so many well known Pittites that we decided to publish it. First we wrote a
letter, however, to some of the men whose pictures were in the ,;-oup and asked them for information regarding
the customs of the fraternities in those days. There were also several faces which could not be identified posi-
tively by Mr. Burtt, and we were able to secure some interesting information regarding them. As some of the
letters’ point out, it was the intention of Sigma Alpha to become a chapter of the national fraternity of S. A. E.,
but, this was never accomplished. Pitt is now represented in S. A. E., although it has no connection with this
original group. It happened that Walter Burtt, the owner of the picture, had been an S. A. E. at Adrian College,
Michigan, before entering the University, which was, no doubt, the reason for their plans towards affiliation with
S. A. E. -

. PHILADELPHIAN WRITES

Rev. Park Hays Miller, ’99, who is located at 6040 Washington Avenue, Philadelphia, sends us a very inter-
esting Ietter, although he admits that “23 years have made a good many impressions surprisingly vague in spite.
of their depth at the time.” He adds the following: I I

“You are quite G°i‘i‘°¢t in Saying that Walter‘ Burtt was one of the leading spirits in the fraternity and that
its mission was to become a chapter of S. A. E. Closely associated with Burtt was my brother, Laird 0. Miller.
who is not in the picture. As I recall, he was head of the chapter at the time the picture was taken, but was kept
away by illness.

“Another man not in the picture is John S. Murry. I know he was a member because he, as a matter of
friendship at the time of my initiation, whispered that it would be to my advantage to bring an old suit along.
Thanks to his friendly sympathy, I carried a huge bundle an over Nunnery Hill up the famous steps and down
again a few_times. When it was all over I asked John what was the idea of the old suit. I was informed that
it was for the amusement of the public. -

“Frequent meetings of the chapter and of the committee were held in the rooms of Kelly and Riley, but the
regular meeting place at night was in Phio Hall, on the top_fIoor of the College building. How this room was
ever secured for the purpose I do not know, but the frat officers had the, key and we made use of it. On one or
two occasions the initiation meeting was held in a hall above my father's stable at the rear of 104 North Avenue,
North Side. The meetings here, especially the feasts, were conducted with great dignity. The banquet table being
improvised from a barn door; but the lobster salad from the Cottage Restaurant was the best I ever ate before
or afterwards.

PARKER LOCATED

“Parker. whose address is said to be unknown on your list, is now in Philadelphia. He is helping to «run
a 50-mile railroad. Which is of 9|‘o8’< importance to its stockholders, even if it is not long on the map. I have
his card so will give you his official title:_ ' . .

“W. George Parker. Traveling Auditor. Cambria and Indiana Railroad, Philadelphia. Frank Mccarrell was
the son of the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church at McKeesport. He became a well known musician and
was an organist in Harrisburg and in Denver. Where he is now, | do not know.

‘‘In those palmy days of real brains and little else. dress suits were not a normal possession of the S. A.
members. For this picture I wore my father's and McCal‘re|| did likewise. My father was 5 foot 7 and I was 6.
Mccarrell was very short, and his father ‘of large proportions. You can see evidence of these facts if you examine
the picture carefully. "

“It is surprising that you don't have the
the team for some time.

“S. A. was active in the College in '97, '98 and ’-99. I suppose it was just one of the many organizations that
have not survived my connection with them. The city in which I was born changed its name, the number of the
house was altered, the prep school went out of business, the University changed its name, and S. A. went out of
business when our class graduated. When I raduated in '99 I was Tamius and held funds to the amount of $18.
I endeavored to secure some authority to dispose of this large estate, but in vain. It is still deposited in the Dollar
Savings Bank of Plttsburh, and I will be glad if the publication of this picture will secure approval from the
surviving members to turn the amount over to the Alumni Hall fund or some worthy cause.

(Editor's Note: The Alumni Editor will follow this up, as he thinks it is a good sugestion.
when he got this picture that it might mean money toward Alumni Hail.)

“To return to the matter of application to S. A. E. Our frat held a banquet in Hotel Lincoln, I believe, at
which some visitors from S. A. E. were present. This may have been a feeler. Possibly formal. applicailzion was
made for a chapter, but the charter was never secured to my knowledge."

PROFESSOR SMlTH'S RECOLLECTIONS

Prof. J. Hammond Smith, '93. of the Department 01‘ Civil Engineering, whose picture appears in the group,
has the following to-say:

“We had no Club house. but held fraternal meetings occasionally. As I remember, most of the, meetings were
held in the Robertson House on Langley Avenue where Kelly and Riley roomed.

“Our initiations Were held in Various P'a°€5- M)’ own began with a blindfold at the gateway to the Andrews
Estate near the south end of Federal Extension and covered a large part of the district surrounding the campus
with a strenuous windup in one of the upper floor rooms of the main building of the University. We held several
of our initiations in the Miller barn on North Avenue, the second floor of which was finished as a gymnasium. One
of our most horrible instruments of torture was an immense rooting horn, which had been made in the University
shops by a group of students and used for boosting our school and football team in many: games. This noise ma-
Chino 0|‘ megaphone W88 about 15 feet long. With a mouth four feet in diameter. It was mounted on a stout wooden
frame with several carryin handles. The double cranking diaphragm vibrator at the small end of the horn pro-
duced the most nerve racking, screeching and roaring sounds which can be imagined. The fraternity member's
nerves were tested by graciously permitting him to enjoy these sounds at the end of the born for a short time.

“We made a serious effort to become a chapter of the S. A. E. fraternity but were not successful, mainly
because the student body of the school was not sufficiently large.

‘‘I am very glad you are looking up the old fraternity records."

‘ RILEY SAYS

A. D. Riley, '98, who is with the Standard Chemical company, Canonsbung, has this to say:

“As Uncle John Brashear would say: ‘A deal of water has run under the bridge since that time,’ but I am
giving you all that I can recall about 8- A. Lyne lived. I believed in the Homewood end of the city. McCarroIi
was a splendid pianist and at that time was accompanist for Gamble, the well known bass soloist.

“I am sure that L. A. Drexler and W. E. Burtt organized the frat. Drexler did a lot of enthusiastic work
and helped carry it along. I recall the proceedings as being carried on in a very dignified manner following the
stage business which Drexler wrote up for us. We had some horse play in the initiations, of course. A couple of
the fellows nearly bled to death in Miller's stable. The illusion was perfect and it must have been then that L. O.Mil|er
decided to take up medicine-——to make people believe things. We had two initiations in the stable of the parents
of L. O. and Park Miller, and I have the most pleasing memory of that household on North Avenue, Allegheny.
with its atmosphere of quiet reﬁnement and genuine hospitality. ’

“I was an officer of some kind, in fact held more than one office. Drexler had a system of rotation of re-
sponsibility that kept us all at work. There was nothing in writing that I recall, except that the Engineering
fellow had to make memoranda of Greek names and terms used in the procedure. I can see that there was an
advantage in formalizing the business with novel and dignified ornamentation, for discussion was more reserved
than 9V" Carried on in the language of the oamPuS- We were playing the game more seriously than had we been
members of a frat of long standing with charter from a national body."

OTHERS HEARD FROM

C. S. Lambie, president of the Lambie Engineering company, Denver, Colo., recalls two names who were not
in the picture, they being Howard Boyd, '99, who is now a missionary In Egypt, and Guy D. Wallace, who is a
minister in Buffalo. He says: “These were probably the Iivest and toughest boys In the fraternity. They were
both ministers’ sons and have turned out to be mininters themselves. I believe I was the last member to be initiat-
ed with the exception of Chester G. Fisher. Sigma Alpha had a bunch of mighty good fellows and the crowd made
its influence felt in school life of that day." '

The inroads of the war caused.

. AIIIIIIIAE lillSSll'

(By Minnie Z. Buckll-ey.)

A glance at the last issue’s Alumni
Page” gives us a. thought or two. In
the writeup of the 1902 Prom the
names of Miss Friesell and of Miss
Miller appear under the heading of
*‘TeaHH10ulnd.s.” Their classiﬁcation
is not to be remarked upovn here,
but——a1l good men and women at-‘
tend all University affairs, and it is
worth noting that these two women,
now known as Mrs. Fullerton and
Mrs. Jarvis, who have done so much
for us since they left school, were
right on the job for the ﬁrst Uni-
versity Prom, and be it remembered
that Mrs. Aimee Frieseil Fullerton
was the ﬁrst woman member of the
ﬁrst committee for the ﬁrst Prom at
Pitt. She continues to be ﬁrst in
many other things» also, for recently
she was the ﬁrst to contribute to-
wards the buying of’ furnishings for
the girls’ room in Alumni Hall.

Mrs. Fullerton has a way of do-
ing things that we surely do appre-
ciate, for instance, she has always
vpracticed what she preaches when
she says that just because your hus-
band is a Pitt man is no reason
why you should not belong to the
Alumni Association and pay your
dues, and very thoughtfully for
years, instead 0-f having two Pitt
Weeklies come to her home, has had
hers directed to a moat p»re.p~a,ratory
school to; giveithe University further

social eve-nts but he has not asked
me nor have I attempted to assume
control over all details connected with
h-olding an event. That has not been
my purpose nor will ‘it be in the fu-
ture. My only interest i-s to see =that
events are conducted upon a sound
ﬁnancial basis, that all bills are paid
and that the surplus or proﬁt is
turned over to the Treasurer of the
org-aniz-ation -holding the event. At
times, to insure financial success, my
committee and I feel compelled to
limit th.e amount of money to be
spent for certain items and also limit
the number of complimentary tickets
issued, but that is as far as we have
gone or care to go. All arrange-
ments are left entirely in the hands
of the social committee in charge of
the social event. What orchestra is
engaged is no «concern of mine or of
my committee; what refreshments
are ‘served is -immaterial to me; who
does the decorating or what decora-
tions are used interests me not at
all. ‘To take a concrete case, the
method of dicstribution of favors em-
ployed at the Junior Prom was en-
tirely within the scope of the duties
of the Prom Committee. I felt that
I had no jurisdiction over distribu-
tion of favors and so assumed none.

In conclusion let me say that the
Senate C-ommittee Wo-rkling with me
and I, personally, intend to ‘get all the
information possible bearing upon the
“flavor mix-up" at the Prom and to
render a report within the near fu-
ture which will fully set forth the re-

- sults o-f our inquiry.

cut out garments yesterday morning
at the weekly meeting for the So-
cial Service party on Thursday from
12:30 to 1:30, at which the garments
will be distributed to the girls to take
home to sew.

The clothes, which include caps,
dresses, petti-coats, sweaters, and
coats, will be taken to the Children’s
Aid Society -of Pittsburgh. At the
party the work for the rest of the
year will be outlined by Dorothy

Mrs. Thomas J. Howells will re-
sume her series of lectures on India

Dr. Thomas Thoburn of C\h1"l1Sl‘. M.
E. Church spoke on “Faith” at the
regular Y. W. C. A. meeting on Mon-
clay, February 27. His remarks were
general but emphatic. He proved to
the girls that multiplication of good
gifts comes through dlividinlg with
others. All nationalities alike should
claim a share according to his opin-
ion. The church, he stated, unlike
most organizations is and ought to
be purely democratic. He also urged
all students in school from distant
towns to become aifilliated with some
church in the city.

The Pitt Weekly in conjunction with the other University publi-
cations has fostered a booster week on the campus. The purpose of
this campaign is to bring about a closer relationship between the stu-
dents, alumni and our advertisers.

Placards have been placed around the campus containing a spe-
cial message to every student and alumnus. We know that Pitt stu-
dents are patronizing Pitt publication advertisers, but the advertiser
does not know they are from Pitt.

Yea Pitt! let ’em have it.

In your number of February 8
there is an article entitled “Better
Diplomats” in which is "urged special
education for our future diplomats.
Let me’ tell you a bit of history to
illustrate your theme.

Nearly thirty years ago Andrew D.
White was appointed minister to
Russia. I had never met Mr. White,
but he had heard me read an article
before the American Hisrtorical As-
soci-ation at Washington. So he pro-
cured my address and wrote me a
letter inviting me to come to see him
and talk about becoming first score-
tary of legation at St. Petersburg. I
went; was very cordially received and
had a preliminary conversation on
the subject. At his invitation I spent
the entire evening with him and de-
tails were apparently settled. The
next day, just as I was about to say
good-bye, he suddenly took my arm
and said: “Dr. Scaife,” I must ask
you a personal question, “Are you
rich?” “No. sir.” ‘‘Haven’t you ten
thousand dollars a year?” ‘A “Far
from it.” “I am sorry. For the
present incumbent has that sum and
‘I would not like to take a secretary
with less.“ That settled the matter
and I left. : I’ speak four languages

is repeated every hour, and perhaps
he does not see the same face in
any two of his dllass-es. ’

In the evening 1‘t’s hurry again‘
‘for the train, and then’ to settle
down for a «little nap or to "gaze
absolutely through the window at
the moving panorama, for he is

Pitt is looking forward to the base-
ball season with greatjnterest. Last
year it will be remembered, Pitt had
one of the best diamond teams that
ever represented the University. The
team made a fine record and to con-
clude the season it defeated Penn
State in two games at State College,
thus rendering the season an entire
success. Pitt had previously lost to
State at Forbes Field in an extra-im
ning "contest.

This year Pitt is expected to be
even stronger than it was -last year.
Only a few men were lost by gradu-
ation and the vacancies of these men
will be acceptably filled by some of
last year’s Freshmen.

INTER-DEPARTMENT  
LEAEUE IIISBANIIS

Due to the lack of interest, the
managers of the "Inter-Department
Basket Ball League teams have de-
cided to disband the organization.
This movewas decided on when for

ipqsed of four teams, representing

_the Schools of, Economics, Mines,
Engineering and the College.

A contested, well‘-played game to Kiski

Saturday aﬁternoon at -Saltsburg, 25
to 24. T'hle- game was «hard fought
on bobhsides» and the ﬁnal score and
victory in doubt until the ﬁnal whis-
tle. Pitt had the lead a number of
times but Kiski was strong and al-
ways able to even up the score or
to forge several points ‘ahead. The
game was fast and was featured by
clever passing and team work on the
part of jboth__teams. Millman and

Thle Freshmen -basket ball team
journeyed to Mczldeesport Tuesdayof
last week and defeated last year's
champions of Western Pennsylvania.
‘in a we-ll-played and closely-contested
game by a margin of seven points,
the ﬁnaal score being 36 to 29. The
iyearlings were never in danger of
losing their lead and played one of
the best games of the season, dis-
playing some clever passing and ex-
cellent shooting. Buchanan, member.-
of last , year's MoKeesport squad,
played a great game against his for-
mer ‘team-mates! and made 30 of the
36 -points scored, by the Freshmen
for‘ in addition to making seven ﬁeld
goals he caged 16 fouls out of 19

formed ‘with this liquid were as

container from which a. glass of
the ﬂuid was ‘taken. A grape was
dropped. into the liquid air, and
when it/was shortly after taken ,- out
{by means of a. pair of tongs, it was

marble. -A -red rose was then im-
mersed into the liquid with the re-
sult that the petals» ‘ became brittle
and broke olfff~-as: soon as they were
touched. An oblong-shaped «box of
mercury into which -a, rod was placed
was, after immersion, as hard as a

ber, ball, which had previously been
dropped into the liquid air, was
thrown to the ground, it hit the

pieces. Some ordinary illuminating

WESTMINSTER in
w. VA. WESLEYAN Til
MEET PANTHERS IIIZIIE

Followers of the cage sport. will
find much to rejoice in upon a perusal
of the schedule for next week. There
are three, games scheduled for the
varsity and every one of them prom-
ises to be a rare exhibition of the
sport at its best. The games are ‘as
follows: Wednesday, March -1, West.-
minster at Trees Gymnasium; T
day, ‘March 3, West Virginia at Trees
Gymnasium, and Wednesday, -:March
8, W. & J., at Washington. The last

game will be in all probability the

hardest of the three for the Panther
tossers will be seeking revenge for
the 31-29 defeat that the Washington

. lads handed them earlier in the sea-

son. The Panthers are rather confi-
dent that they can humble their old
foes and it is certain that they will
strive their hardest to keep the Pres-
idents from scoring a second victory
over them this season. Thei; W. & J.

team that will face the Pitt floor‘ men

is rated as being one of the best]

"teams in this section and they will
"have the added advantage of being

on their home fIoor.'But the Panthers,
on the other hand, will go into the
contest with at determination that
should accomplish much. All in all

, it should prove to be one of the hard-
est-fought games of the season.

West Virginia Wesleyan should not
give the Panthers so much trouble.

‘They have not been overly successful
with their team this year and on the

bzfsis. of comparative scores should
not‘ offer" any serious opposition to the
Panthers. They were recently defeat-.
ed by West Virginia University, while
West Virginia was forced to how ‘be-
fore, the Panthers. Last year we de-
feated them by a 44-38 score. Last
year Pitt defeated Westminster by a
54-23 score. -I

The Panther. medley relay‘ team

ed exceptionally well in finishing. but
six orreiglit yards in the rear of the
Maroon runners, for Lafayette is
‘known to have one of the strongest
relay teams in the country ‘ét_ that
particular distance. V ‘ I

The 220-yard‘ dash was run by
Wakefield, opposed by Leconey of
Lafayette. Wakefield negotiated the
distance in :2-12-5, but was slightly
behind.Leconey. Tom Martin took up

. the race for a quarter mile and by do-

ing :52 3-5 was able to finish on even.
terms‘ with Malick, fgrmer Harrisburg
Tech star. In the half mile, Hunt of
Lafayette got a ten-yard lead over
Carpenter, although Carp ran a 2:05
half, which sent Bob Crawford, one
of the country's best milers, off to a
fair lead over Hays.  . ‘

. Crawford. runningjhis favorite race,"
soon increased this lead to forty
yards.‘ Hays began his spurt early and
almost closed up the entire distance,
but"his grand. finish fell just about;
‘six or eight yards short of overtaking
the Lafayette flier. Haysitimgyfor the
mile was 4:31. .”

Hays also ran in the 1,000-yard in-
vitation race and was given third.
‘place, although it was -prac.tica1ly‘a
toss-up between S,-hieldsof State, and
him for second. Crawford won the
race, which was mixed up by the run-
tiers, being given the I gun on the
wrong lap. * ,

-met defeat, last Saturday night at;

In the first game of their Eastern
trip ‘Pitt ‘was subjected to one of the
,worst beatings they have been forced

,. to take in» a long time. Cornell, the

conquerors of Penn, defeated Pitt in
the State Armory by the one-sided
score of 38 to 13. The Panthers Were“
“utterly unable‘ to stop‘ the Cornell
offensive and seemed to lack any at-
tacking power themselves. Many _easy.
shots were missed-by Cornell who had
twice as many shots asthey register-
ed._ The first half was all Cornell and
ended with the Ithacans in the lead
by the score of 20 to-4. The second
‘half opened with ‘a. [number of sub-

little trouble result-
ed. . . y ‘ S '- I I

Jordan and Rose; were the only Pitt
men who-could do anythi‘ng against
the Cornell defense the Panther cap-

the, floor. Luther, Barkelew and Cap-
ron were thebig Red and White stars,
tossing thirteen vfield baskets among
th$n. ‘,:J_yV ‘ ,
The Panther cage artists dropped
two hard-luck contests with Colgate
and Syracuse on the last days of the
Easterni-invasion. Both games were
lost by a four—point margin. Colgate
administered the defeat last Thurs-
day 29-25.' Syracuse defeated the
Panthers -last Friday 25-21. The play
in both games was fast. and interest-
ing every moment, the victors win-
ning only in the final moments 0

Colgate got away to a substantial
‘lead in the first half. The.Pi,tI: offense
finally awakened in the second
period. The -Panther attack" in this
period was almost, irres.istible,_ but
their belated rally fell-short of pro-
ducing the desired victory. Captain
Jordan’s work in this contest was al-
most. spectacular. ' His /brililiant floor
work and _,four field goals gained the

tor that kept Pitt from the victory. ,
= Sy acuse was victorious only after.
the fiercest kind‘ of a struggle with
the Panthers. The spore was tied at
the end of the half and it was not
until the last few minutes that Syra-
cuse could forge to the front. The
ability of the Syracusans to drop con-
sistent fouls won 'the'gamd for the
New York school. As in the Colgate
ycontest, Jordan was the ‘outstanding
star of the game, with his "three goals
from the field.— ’ -' ' .
