on Use of Athletic Facilities

By RODNEY B. Gturrtrn

Pitt News Staff Writer
The ‘Senate Council again tabled

a motion by Nathan Hershey,»

professor of health law, that would
temporarily restrict use. of Pitt's
physical education_facilities to the
“University community” during

their‘ ﬁrst meeting of the year

Monday in the Cathedral’s Babcock
Room.

Hershey explained his motion
was meant to “create a status quo”
until the Senate Council had. a"
chance to review the report by the

_ Subcommittee on Intramurals and

Recreation to the Senate Athletics

Committee. The report severely

criticizes the state of intramurals .at .
Pitt’ and suggests use of _Pitt

athletic facilities by outside groups

be severely limited. '

Professor Hershey also challeng-
ed Chancellor Posvar to present his
opinions on the motion and the
intramurals committee. report.

“I would like to elicit some“

response from the chancellor on
this matter,” said Hershey.
‘Posvar responded, saying there
was policy statement on the use of.
Pitt athletic ‘facilities and also

commented on the distribution of ‘

the subcommittee report before its
review by the SAC.

The chancellor's ﬁrst answer to
the inquiry apparently did not
satisfy Hershey.

“I am kind of _confused -by the
response given to my question,”
Hershey said. “Recreational
leisure time is only tolerated. The
policy might be a good one, but the
implementation is wrong.” 2

Posvar clariﬁed his answer._

“The potential University
recreational use of facilities is small

7 and if the chance for community

use and societal beneﬁt is great, I
don’t want to rule out the priority of
community over recreational,” said
Posvar. ‘ . _

A; Pitt Officials Discuss
Schenley Repairs

By SUE McFARLAND

Pitt News Staff Writer

I A plan calling for the renovation
of and possible addition to existing
Schenley Hall facilities was given
the go-ahead yesterday at a
meeting of University administra-
tive ofﬁcials. _‘

According to Willard “Bud”
Heaps, student activities director,
the project still is in the planning
stages with no speciﬁc architec-
tural designs or funding schemes
available.

The only funding decision

A ' reached was that the project would

be funded by a student union fee,
assessed to every full- and
part-time undergraduate after the
project's inception. '

-a third ten-year. period.

 

withvthe chancellor to defend the

v use of facilities by outside groups,

citing the public relations benefit of
facilities readily available to the
community.

“I think facilities should remain:

open,” said Hesidence. “When I

talkto state legislators one of their ‘

biggest complaints is the lack of
availability of University facilities
to the local community.”

After this exchange Hershey
decided not to pursue the matter

I further at the meeting andmoved

his proposal be tabled‘ until
council's November meeting. The
council approved the motion. 3 .

A In his address to the council
Posvar said Pitt planned to ask fora

$75. million appropriation from the V ’_-_:.
state forthe 1979-1980 school year: .__‘ j_fj
He said Pitt officials plan to keep a 

close eye‘ on‘ appropriations.

“We have to see how ‘the "

November ‘election turns. out» and}
how Proposition“ 13 affects’-,Penn:-.._ .
sylvania and other states,”_ the 

Chancellor added. _   

introduced during the summer,
Acting Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs William Markus put a $6.5
million price tag on the projects‘ He
said every full-time undergraduate
would be charged $10 a term for a
ten-year ‘period. Part-time stu-
a $5 Student Union fee. ' .
Markus added . that during a
second ten-year period the student
union fee would be raised to $15 for
full-time students and $7.50 for
part-time students. A similar hike
would be levied at the beginning of

.After yesterday-is meeting, how-
ever, Heaps said-the $6.5 million
ﬁgure, along with the exact amount
of the student union fee, had not
deﬁnitely been decided upon. The I

Prjmanii'sg Provides Late Night Piii Stop

It is'a boisterous precision with which
the man attacks his night-long task:
Assembling in short order the never-
ending string of unorthodox sandwiches
needed to satisfy the unorthodox crowd at
Primanti’s. '

His routine begins each midnight at the
Primanti Brothers Strip District diner.
Standing before a grill area cluttered with
unruly piles of meats, cheese, condiments
and thick-sliced Italian bread, he takes a
deep breath and begins to work. The
“meat” of the sandwich—the selection
ranges from roast beef to cheese steak and

bacon to sardine—is slapped onto a large .

hunk of bread. While the grill man’s left
hand is accomplishing this, his right slides
into a tray of pickled cabbage, a dripping
mound, then palms a tomato slice and
adds this to the now three‘-inch‘ thick

“ .. creation. A fistful of frenchfries follows,

mashed on top of the other ingredients,
and a second slice of bread completes the
project. k . p

A deft wrapping with a sheet of waxed
paper readies the sandwich for its speedy
journey across the counter and toward-
never to—-—its owner, who now has the

columnist-at—|arge

problem of how to approach a six-inch
thick sandwich that appears ready to

make the first move.

The entire process, from meat on the
grill to sandwich at the counter, has con-
sumed perhaps six seconds.

The french-fry. laden sandwich is not

the only thing-that sets} Prinianti’s apart _

from the norm. There are the hours,
midnight to 4 pm., set to attract the
produce workers and truckers who
inhabit the Strip District overnight. And
the quick though unusual service, which‘
would cause_ Michelin’s to forget about
stars and award a black hole instead.

And there are the patrons, a lively
combination of hardened truckers from
the land of red necks, white socks and
Blue Ribbon beer; dazed night people
from all sidewalks of life (the girls from
Liberty Avenue’s Stage 966 last year put
on a strip show there to enthusiastic
reviews); curious celebrities (Emerson,
Lake and, Palmer were rumored to. have
eaten there, . and Jackie Sherrill’s

autographed photograph adorns one‘

wall); and a surprisingly large number 0
regulars from Pitt. _ _ I

_LOS ANGELES—Yellow school
buses rolled over Los Angeles’
crowded freeways Tuesday in the
start of an integration plan for the
nation's second-largest district.

. But a boycott by anti-busing forces

apparently kept many white pupils
at home.

Many of the 2,300 buses arrived
at cross’-town exchange schools
with only a few students aboard.
Some were reported running far
behind" schedule, and four were

involved in minor accidents with no
injuries. . »

A special police task force,
including 15 helicopters, monitored
the situation in the 711-square-mile
district and reported no major
problems. I _ H

The program toad?” effect just
hours after an anti-busing rally
Monday night in the San Fernando
Valley drew an estimated 4,000
parents and children. They heard
leaders urge a boycott that would
force the district to abolish busing.

Spokesmen for the district said
official attendance ﬁgures would
not be avail_able until later
Tuesday, but district ofﬁcials and
Mayor Tom Bradley proclaimed the
plan a success.

“I’m most pleased by the
response of the people of Los
Angeles,” said Bradley. “I’m very
pleased at the way this has all come
together, the way the community
has come together.”

Asked about some buses running
near-empty, he said, “I don’t

anticipate any signiﬁcant boycott. I
think the overwhelming majority of
people in this city are going to obey
the law whether or not they like it.”
Most of the partially-ﬁlled buses
were those which left the predom-
inantly white San Fernando Valley
for inner-city minority schools.
Attendance was heavier for stu-
dents going in the other direction.
Only 13 of 62 students scheduled to
ride one bus from the Valley were
aboardwhen the vehicle made its
last stop and headed for the

Integration Plan

freeways. ,

Of the district's 570,000 stul

dents, 35.percent are Hispanic, 34
percent white, 24 percent black and
7 percent Asian. The busing plan
covers 62,000 students in the fourth
through eighth grades—30,000 of
whom volunteered to be bused.

' While the district began its
integration program, parents and
youngsters who were not on the
buses began classes at neighbor-
hood tutoring sessions and new
private schools.

' “Chub”

The service at Primanti’s is part
of the place’s peculiar, but fascin-
ating, charm. ’  ‘allowed, the
employees will walk all over a
customer; "anyone tarrying too long
over the wall-‘mounted menu will-
be assigned “cheese steak and a
Coke_” by an impatient, though
good-natured, waiter. V '

Also, since the folks at
Primanti’s don’t enjoy dealing with
things as trivial as change, an
uninitiated customer sometimes
will be given an “ecclesiastical
discount” (the smile leaves when
one counts his change outside the
discovers he has left a small
‘ ‘contribution ’ ’ behind).

But the service is incredibly fast
and undercharging is at least as
prevalent as the “discount.” The
food—-sandwiches, soup and chili
—carries prices that are fair.

One large part of Primanti’s
attraction left this year when
(the nickname is an

understatement), the most colorful
waiter, left to open a similar
establishment that bears his name
in the North Hills.

But even without Chub,
Primanti’s is, if nothing else,
different. If the fries’ resting place
inside an already-weird sandwich is
not odd enough, they also are made
from unpeeled potatoes. The
crowd is semi-crazed; when one
man begins to practice saxophone,
as he is wont to do at 3 a.m. at one
of the front tables, few persons lift
their face from their sandwich. The
help is jovial ‘and efﬁcient, but
impatient with anyone who dis-

.turbs the routine that allows

Primanti’s to ﬂourish.-

/All of this is the Primanti’s
reciipe, one that has been sampled
because of word-of-mouth by many
Pitt students; the combination may
never be found in any cookbook,
but, especially at 4 a.m., it’s a good
one nonetheless. A

ﬁgures Markus released earlier
were only base calculations on
materials per square foot of space
in the Schenley Hall‘, he said.

Heaps added that the tentative
cost ﬁgures will become more
speciﬁc as he and others involved
in the project continue to meet on
the matter.

“Many students want to know
just what Pitt will be contributing
to this project,” Heaps said. “Pitt
is giving the up-front funding for
the renovations. The student union
fee will be just a way of repaying
the University. Pitt also gave up
quite a bit when it bought Schenley
Hall back in the 505.”

The idea of a student union fee
will not be unique to Pitt, Heaps
said, but is a common practice at
many colleges and universities.

“At many‘ universities where
there are ﬁrst-rate student union
facilities, the fee. paid by students

is as high as $50 per term,” he .

said. “I really can't see our fee
going quite that high.”

Heaps added that a starting date '

for the project depends on.the

progress vmade at a‘ series of »

meetings, like yesterday’s, involv-
ing the Chancellor, an architectural
ﬁrm and other University ofﬁcials.
The next meeting is planned for
next Thursday. ' A
Heaps also said that he and
others involved in the project would
be sitting down ‘with members of
the Student Government Board to
solicit student input. He said, a
detailed list of requests by SGB
members has been forwarded to
..Max Andrews, representing the
University in negotiations with the
Pittsburgh architectural ﬁrm of
Williams, Trebilcock and White-
head. ’ »

‘SGB member Dave Hesidence
said he and other board members
approve of the project as well as the
Student Union fee. .

“A*$I0 student union fee in my
mind is not a pittance for most
students, but it’s well worth the
investment,” Hesidence said.
“What we have now is a building
that doesn’t look like a student

union and doesn’t operate like a-

student union.” I
Hesidence. said that includedon
the list of requests for the project is
a campus. store in the heart of the
building, an improved recreation
area, a bus information booth, an

improved cafeteria, a lounge area.

serving alcoholic beverages and
providing some type of live
entertainment, overnight facilities
for commuters, an auditorium and
a snack bar ’ '
Hesidence cited the decline in
enrollment at Pitt as an‘ area that
might well be improved with a

rennovated student union.
“Pitt is a commuter institution with
inadequate facilities to accomodate
the majority of these students,” he
said.“This project might give Pitt
what it needs to compete.”

Hesidence said the SGB mem-
bers applaud Markus for making
the Student Union rennovation
project his No. 1 priority during the
time he has been in ofﬁce.

“Our ultimate goal in this project
is to have the most unique urban

' ‘university in the United States in

terms of responding to the needs of
students,” Heaps said. “We want
to further enhance the nature of the
University while at the same time
make _a statement for the entire
University community.” ’

Blackouts Leave Pittin Dark  
As Pronksters Play Their Games

By ED TACK

Two related equipment failures
darkenedthe roomsof the Forbes
Quad on two occasions late
yesterday and caused disturbances
in elevator activity within the
Cathedral and Ruskin and Clapp
halls during peak afternoon
activity.

From at least 3 to 4 p.m.
yesterday, a failure caused a
complete power stoppage within
the Forbes Quad, shutting down
elevators, hall lights and stereos.
Elevator activity in the three other
buildings was halted, forcing
people to use staircases.

/A similar failure ﬁve hours later
shut down room lights in the Quad
for two hours, but emergency
power" systems provided elevator
service and hallway light. The
disturbance lasted from approxi-
mately 8:25 till 10:25 p.m.

An unidentified girl may have
sprained her neck when she slipped
on a pool of water in Brackenridge
Hall on a pool of water in

during the failure, according to a
dormitory ofﬁcial. Further infor-
mation on the girl was unavailable.

No other injuries were reported
nor was any stealing or looting
during the blackout, said,campus
police.

A campus police ofﬁcer may have
been hit by a bucket of water,
however, by a student in Mc-
Cormack Hall. The policeman,
Patrolman Robert Remmen, said
the matter “wasn’t much.”

Remmen said students took
advantage of the situation by
throwing ﬁrecrackers out windows

. and by shouting at neighbors in

adjoining halls. He also reported
that students “were doing their
studying in the hallways.” ’

Remmen said that the residents
“acted up initially, but once the
novelty of the situation were off they
settled down.”

Electrical engineer Edward Con-
ley said he did not know the exact
cause of the blackouts but that it
was clear that a ‘ ‘bréaker” switch, a
safety device that shuts down the

power, was somehow tripped. He
said he would attempt to find the
cause “first thing in the morning.”

“We’ll have an entire crew down
here first thing,” he said after
restoring power approximately 25
minutes after entering the electrical
room beneath Bruce Hall.

Conley speculated that it may
have been intense heat within the
room that caused the breaker to
trip. He said the room was “very,
very warm.”

He did emphasize that the
tripping of the breaker averted
damage to the entire Quad electrical

" system. The University- recently

installed new electrical equipment
in the Quad as a result of renovating
Bruce Hall into dormitories.

Jim ‘ MacDonald, a McCormick
Hall desk attendant, said there was
‘ ‘some screaming, but generally the
students handled the situation
quietly.”

‘ ‘It was nothing like the 1977 New
York City blackout, I can tell you
that,” said MacDonald, who was in
New York at the time.

 "The Pennsylvania Legislature's position on fun- i

alleviate the burden on students already enrolled.

Pitt’s medical school tuition rose 25 percent this year, t A

to $_5_000 a year, .Some help-—real dollars and cents

help from Harrisburg and Washington——could’

demonstrate that the government is interested in the
student after he is admitted to school. But until then
the bureaucratic message is clear: “Let them write
checks.”

The reasons for an academically distinguished,
financially sound medical school are ObVl0llS. This _

society, indeed this world, needs qualified general
practitioners and specialists. When Pitt started its
medical school, it made a committment to the Pit-
tsburgh. community and all people to pursue ex-
cellence in the_teaching of medicine. Toensure this
superiority, the best teachers available must be
recruited. Because a doctor can command a high
salary in hospital work or private practice, any

» distinguished medical school must make it worth a

such a small amount, and tuitions have been ‘hiked "

for four consecutive years. Medical school funding

7 for this year continued at the 1971 level-.

The federal govemment’s money distribution is

it ‘ equally puzzling. For example, it will spend thousan-
—.ds—possibly millions—of dollars trying to guarantee

-places. for minority students in medical school (which
_is a legitimate goal), yet its contributions to the

‘ educational process itself are not large enough to

doctor’s while to leave or curtail his lucrative outside
job. The current lack. of appropriations has resulted
in no salary increase for medical school faculty and
cutbacks in staff for this year. That is no way to pur-

‘ . sueexcellence. Werner recognized the dilemma; he

apparently_..could- see no end to the problem, and ~

resigned. .
In a statement released this past--weekend, Chan-
cellor Posvar hinted that solutions were coming to

the problems of the medical school:

“We have a great medical school,” the statement
said, “and during. the next vear we shall be making

Werner’s Resignation and LegislativePriorities

‘decisions about personnel and resources that will en--

sure its continued‘ success .and even greater progress
in thenext decade.-”- « .

We anxiously await the forthcoming ad-
ministration decisions and hope their merits will be
openly discussed" and debated. Given govemment’s
aversion to funding this important branch of
education, we fear the decisions reached could be
drastic "policy changes that would inhibit Pitt’s
School of Medicine’s ability to offer quality medical
education. Whatever the decisions are, the right’an-

_swers must be reached now so that no more deans,

and particularly no future doctors, resign or give up
out of discouragement.

‘The 1970s have been called the
(“Me Decade,” and appropriately

so. The disappointments of the ’60s
have resulted in a retreat from

‘ ' issues and activism. After a

generation of turmoil and unrest
we have fallen back into the only
area where we feel in control-the
self. ,

Even there we seem to suffer
from iuncertainly. Self-help pro-

-fgrams—“I’m OK, you're OK,”
- how to love yourself, self-analysis

in 10 easy lessons and other forms

("of weight-lifting for the weary
._spirit—pervade the marketplace. ‘

Even those seemingly at the
pinnacle of popular culture regu-

”larly retreat to the guru or the

couch, as any issue of People
magazine will tell you. Preoccupied
with self, our concept of self seems’
at a low point; as a group, we seem

To combat this, we ﬁnd EST,
Moonies and a plethora of other

' groups emerging as the new cults

of the 70s. All of them focus on the
growth of the self.

These “organizations” are

duals sharing a common problem.
To their members the groups are

answer all the questions. Indeed,

having lost sight of our own
opinions (or perhaps being too. lazy
to ﬁnd them)‘, we seek those who
can prepackage them for easy
consumption and expulsion. But
the problem of our own identity
remains unresolved if we get all our
answers from others.

The “herd” instinct these
groups encourage damages the self
we are all seemingly soeager to
maintain. The “Me Decade”
becomes a decade of paradox—for
the betterment of self, we
surrender ourselves to others.

The media, of course, encourage
this kind of reverse individualism.“
“You’ve come a long way, baby,”
“Show them where you live;” in
other words, identify yourself as
yourself the way everybody else
does. On one level such en-
couragement to conform seems
harmless enough; the choices are
varied to give the illusion of
difference. But, unfortunately, this
attitude of _ wanting to belong
percolates up and over into life’s
more important areas, where
pre-fabricated opinions do more
harm. A

In such a world, where opinions
seem to be cut to the fashion of the
"day, month or year, we need to
develop our own perspective.

if Reflections on the ‘Me Decade’

Deﬁned as a way of looking at
things (by me, not Webster-’s),
“perspective” implies not only the
ability to take distance from current
events, but also to understand how
things ﬁt in our culture, to have an
idea of value and to understand
what is important and what is not.
Perspective is a view of life that is
commitment "to

something outside the self.
As long as the emphasis remains

on growth of self or growth of a cult
group for the sake of growth, any
perspective becomes myopic. It is
impossible to solve the problems of
selfliood without taking respon-
sibility for them. Pre-fab answers
will never be wholly satisfactory.
And if we do not choose to deﬁne
our own perspective, it will
assuredly be shaped for us.

All this is not to say that rampant
non-conformity is the answer; nor
is identity with a group the
problem. What we must develop is
a sense that we can conﬁdently
come to our own conclusions and
judgements. A

Perspective is not an Archie
Bunker-like ‘ bunch of opinions
developed through prejudice. It can
be ﬂexible, and it grows out of

intelligent questing. But it _must
come from commitment, not from a

' wavering self. A surrender of self,

no matter how attractive the ideas,
can only lead. to loss, of‘ ourselves
and for our culture. ‘ ‘ - A

Letters  

' We are writing with regard to the
Summer Scholarships’ Program for
Minority Premedical Students that

A has been functioning for the past

two summers under our direction at
the School of Medicine of the
University of Pittsburgh. The
purpose of this letter is to
emphasize a major distinction
between our program _and the
Medical Scholarships Program that
is administered independently by

i the Ofﬁce of the Dean of the School

of Medicine and to properly
acknowledge the sources of support
for the Summer Scholars‘ Program.
We are anxious that the two
programs be clearly distinguished
becaused the Dean‘s Medical
Scholars Program promised that
high school students who are
.accepted into the program would
be granted provisional acceptance
to the School of Medicine. _ _
Recent news accounts of the
School of Medicine's efforts re-
garding minority affairs fail to
establish whether provisional ac-
ceptance to the School remains a
part of the Medical Scholars
Program. It is our judgement that
the offer of provisional acceptance
to medical school by the School of
Medicine to any group of socially
and economically disadvantaged
students before they have even
begun their premedical education

, represents an indefensible action.

For‘ the minority student the
meaning of the provisional accep-
tance status remains open to
question. For example, what level
of academic performance must a
student achieve to maintain the
provisional acceptance status?
These questions, in addition to the
broader issue of the wisdom of the
provisional acceptance status as a
part of an afﬁrmative action
program, should be addressed by
the administration of the school.

The Summer Scholars‘ Program
for Minority Premedical Students
promises no provisional acceptance
to the University of Pittsburgh‘s
School of Medicine nor to any other
medical school. The purpose of our
program‘ is to attract the very best,
undergraduate minority students,
with an interest in medicine, from

"the Pittsburgh‘ area to ‘ the“

laboratories of the. health .center._of

. v.

Med School Minority Affairs

the University of Pittsburgh for a_
ten-week work experience during
the summer.

We are conﬁdent that the
Summer Scholars‘ Program for
Minority Premedical Students will:
encourage the development of
bonds of trust between the talented
minority youth of Western Penn-
sylvania and the faculty members
within the School of Medicine.

We are grateful to the Negro
Educational Emergency Drive
(NEED), the Maurice Fa_lk Medical
Fund, and the University of
Pittsburgh for providing the funds ’

to support these scholars during ‘

the summer months. We are also
indebted to the many faculty
members in the School of Medicine
who have given of their valuable
time and opened their laboratories
to these talented and motivated
scholars.

A Retraction

The Aug. 9 issue of The Pitt News
contained an article concerning
WPGH’s carrier current problems.

The article speciﬁcally stated that
the reason for our problems is
ﬁnancial, which is quite true. How-
ever, I was quoted as saying,

_ “Almost all organizations had their

budgets cut because of the Pitt
Union Programming Council.”

This was a false statement made
because of a misunderstanding that
I, along with many other students,
had concerning the PUPC.

I believed that the formation and
subsequent funding of the PUPC
resulted in a lack of funds for other
organizations. Actually, the PUPC
received $5,000 less from the SGB
than the old Lectures and Concert
Committees received. I think the
leaders of all student organizations
should be made aware that the.
PUPC did not cause any ﬁnancial
problems to these organizations.

his own hat into the political ring yesterday.

An almost inseparable chum of the mayor’s for seven years, Gaudiosi

' announced he is a mayoral candidate for the Democratic nomination in

1979.
Rizzo also hopes to be on the ticket, vowing to ﬁght for a change in the

‘ City Charter that would permit him to seek a third consecutive term.

In recent months both men have waffled about their political

Vambitions—Rizzo at one point saying he wasn't going to run again and

Gaudiosi saying he wouldn’t run if Rizzo as on the ticket.

But that's all changed.

“In all honesty,” Gaudiosi, said in- an interview after his
announcement yesterday, “I think he (Rizzo) lacks moral courage. He
has not faced up to the problems that face the city. He is just selling the

‘city now to insure his political future.”

Asked what he owes Rizzo for bringing him_ into government,
Gaudiosi replied: “He has given_ me exposure. Istill have affection for

him. I feel sorry for him. I feel he has an ego problem.”’

Post Gazette Hearing Set

ﬁled on behalf of a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reporter seeking to have a
federal subpoena against her quashed.
Reporter Joyce Gemperlein was to have appeared before a_grand jury

tomorrow, but that appearance has been delayed because of the hearing _
- date. - '

Miss Gemperlein was subpoenaed following a story she wrote based
on a memo within the U.S. Attorn_ey’s,ofﬁce, which the government
says contained secret grand jury testimony.

The memo dealt with prosecution plans in a sex-blackmail attempt
involving Allegheny County Commissioner Robert Peirce.

U.S. Attorney Blair Grifﬁth sought the subpoena, saying the reporter
is a necessary witness in -the investigation of apparent grand jury
abuse.: .

The U.S. Attomey’s office sought to have the hearing on the motion
held before Miss Gemperlein’s scheduled grand jury appearance.

But U.S. District Judge Donald Zeigler said the federal court docket
was too tightly scheduled to ﬁt the hearing in before next week.

 Nicaraguan Fighting Continues

The rear window of his police cruiser had been shattered by gunﬁre

Intense anti-government ﬁghting alsowas said to be continuing in

down and military roadblocks made travel difﬁcult.

BRIEFS      

Vote on
Ethics Bill

By The Associated Press I

HARRISBURG--Despite months
of hearings, a Senate committee
said yesterday it needs more
information on a tough ethics bill

' and voted to table it.
But the House will try to revive I

the ethics issue today by attempt-
ing to insert an equally strigt ethics
code into a Senate-passed bill.

House members hope that
maneuver will send the ethics bill
right to the Senate ﬂoor, instead of
getting bottled up in a Senate
committee.

That’s what happened when Sen.
Paul McKinney, D-Philadelphia,
used four proxy votes to assure that
his State Government Committee
would not move the Senate’s
version of an ethics code to the full

~ Senate.

Sen. Robert Mellow, chairman ‘of
the subcommittee that worked four
months on the ethics proposal, was_
outraged.‘ He and other members
shouted angrily at each other
during the meeting. '

“I think the powers that be took
a great step to kill this bill today,”
he said after the meeting.

He wouldn’t identify the powers, .
but it was an obvious reference to
President Pro Tem Martin Murray,
D-Luzerne, who has generally
‘opposed reform measures.

“The thing that irritates me is
the hypocrisy of the entire issue,”
Mellow added. “Everybody said
thisis what they wanted. But when
push comes to shove they’re just
not there.”

Four of the committee members/
said the bill was either too broad, I
too vague or too selective and
needs extensive amending. ’

Israel Refuses to Compromise
At Camp David Summit Talks

By The Associated Press

CAMP DAVID, Md.--Despite a
“gigantic effort,” President Carter
has been unable to gain major
concessions from .Israel -at the
Mideast summit, diplomatic source,
said yesterday.

“Getting Israel to move was the
problem all along, even before the

summit began, ’ ’ said an official who ’

was “too early to make a judgment
either way” about the summit’s
outcome. . __ V V .

Field House S
Plans Face
Money Crunch

By JIM PANE
Pitt News Staff Writer

“Everything’s up in the air‘ right
now” concerning renovations of
the Fitzgerald Field House, a
project that was scheduled to have
been completed by Nov. 15.

“We’ve only lost 10 days on that

completion date,” Hunt Martin. .

Pitt’.s director of facility planning,
.,said yesterday. “We’re. in the
process now of trying to determine.
how to handle the situation. We’re
talking to the architect, the director
of athletics, the contractor and the
budget office to see exactly where
we stan .” 1 -
Plagued with “more. questions
than answers,” the University is
“very close to making a decision,”
possibly by the end of the week,
Martin said. That decision should.
determine whether renovations will '
be completed by the start of .
basketball season in late November.

Pitt's strict budget is a main _,

concern, forcing a redesigning‘ of
the entire project. According to
Martin, six bids have been received
for the job, four of which are ‘ ‘quite
close” to the University’s budget
allotment.

“It’s the low bid with which
we’re _dealing,’.’ Martin said.

Pitt sports information director
Dean Billick, who said monies have
been provided by the Golden
Panthers and through Chancellor
Po§var’s office, added that
architectual ' errors have
necessitated the restructuring.

Originally,. the seating capacity
was to -be increased by 6,000, but
Billick said “we couldn’t _fit all the
seats, which perhaps will lead to
new types of monies and a
redesigning of the entire project.”

The "basic plans have not been
scrapped, however. According to
Billick, features such as the addition
of a women’s locker.-room will
remain in the blueprints. '

“It’s not a matter of what will be

'done,” he said, “but a matter of

when it will be started.”

Jody Powell, White House press
secretary and summit spokesman,
cautioned reporters not to draw
conclusions from the suspension of
three-way meetings. ‘ ‘There hasn’t
been any need for one,” he said.

Powell said “there has been
ﬂexibility shown on both sides.”
But he.did not claim the president

' Powell provided little detail of the

discussions have centered on
fundamental issues, including Arab
demands that Israel give up the land
it captured during the 1967 war and
recognize Palestinian Arabs’
“legitimate rights” to a homeland

‘on the Israeli-occupied West Bank

of the Jordan River. .

Powell disclosed that Sadat
telephoned Jordan’s King Hussein
on Monday, but there was no details

disclosed about their conversation. _

_ Hussein, who lost the West Bank

to Israel after 19 years of control by
Jordan, has ruled himself out of
Mideast peace talks until Israel
commits itself to withdrawal.

“There are no plans for King
Hussein to _come to Camp David,”
Powell said.

Powell also refused to speculate
on how the summit would
conclude.

Carter, his press secretary said,
has shuttled between Sadat and
Begin, looking for compromises on
the future of the West Bank and
Palestinian Arabs.

Powell has said Carter would
bring the two leaders together at an
appropriate point.~

Meanwhile, in Bonn, West
Germany, Syrian President Hafez
Assad blasted Sadat’s Mideast
peace initiative and the Camp David
summit, saying there ‘can be no
peace until _‘ ‘the rights of the
Palestinians” are restored and
occupied Arab lands returned.

t     First Draft

The 12 students in the seminar on evolutionary biology
huddle together in a classroom with a 250-seat capacity.
Their professor strides back and forth on the dais, his voice
echoing through the room. Next door,‘80 students cram into
a small, airless room that seats 60 persons. Their professor,
,back to the blackboard, sneezes and gives his cold to
everyone in the first three rows. ...Welcome back to school.

Those students who have attended school non-stop since
the age of six adjust routinely to school and crowded
lclassrooms, schedule mix-ups, long lines at the registrar's of-
fice and lunches at Burger Chef. But for those students who
have broken out of the educational cycle to work,- raise
families and to “discover”'themselves, the return to school is
a new challenge. In this issue of Fifth Ave., four people who
have “stepped out" of college and then returned discuss
their attitudes toward education and career goals.

After a summer of- unrestricted use of the family
automobile, some students, deprived of private transpor-
tation on campus, despair of ever leaving the confines of
Oakland. But thank God and PAT transit for the buses. They
might not always come on time, but they do run in almost
every type of weather.

    Stepping from

By ANGELE ELUS

MAGGIE McKAY

Kindergarten to graduate school is a non-stop flight for many students,
with only summer-long stopovers into “the real.world. " But the trend of the
1970's, according to many educators, is for students to. delay their
educational travels to work, raise families and to cultivate financial and
psychological independence. The atmosphere of the 70's is less urgent
than the decade that preceded it. There is no strong deterrent such as the
Vietnam War and the draft, to “stepping out” of the academic cycle. i

At Penn State, for example, undergraduate levels of absence are up a

third since 1 9 71 .

According to some educators, over 90 percent of the undergraduate
leave- takers ultimately return to finish their education.

-“People find they can't get along without a degree,” Nancy Kaplan, Pitt
School of General Studies advisor, said recently.

Janet l.5eal, Director of Pitt's Office of Continuing Education for Women,
agreed, adding that "most women in our program have come to get a

marketable skil . "

Z

Becoming a doctor has been one
of Sandy Loevner’s ambitions since
age 14. Today, at 27, she is a Pitt
junior preparing for medical school.

A chronic physical illness, now
regulated, kept Sandy from finishing
her education for years. After
discouraging stints at the University
of Denver, Duquesne University and
Chatham College, she left school in
1973 to work in a Squirrel Hill fashion

I shop owned by her mother.

_ “I was successful in my work, but I
wasn't happy,” Sandy said. “I finally

‘ decided to return to college in

January, when I was last in the
hospital. I had been tossing around
the idea of school in my head,
thinking of all the things I would have
to give up—an independent income, a
car. But at 27, I decided that, if I
really wanted to go to medical school,

. it was time to return." '

Sandy is attending Pitt full time this
fall after taking classes during spring
and summer sessions. She chose
Pitt over Chatham College because
she felt that Janet Deal, director of
the Office of Continuing Education for
Women, “was more interested in me
as a person than the people in
Chatham’s women's program. I ap-
preciated her helpfulness and
thoughtfulness."

Initially the size of many Pitt
classes frustrated Sandy, who had
been accustomed to classes of 20
students. She said the University of-
fers a diversity of opinion not
available at smaller schools, however.

“At Chatham, at least at the time I
went there, all the women thought
alike," she said. ‘‘I wasn't getting
male opinions on female issues."

Sandy feels that she has benefit-‘
hted from the delay in completing her

education.

‘‘It took a lot of-years ‘for my am-
bitions to crystallize," she said.
“When I was 18, I didn't really know
what I was going to be, and it didn't
matter what grades I got. Now I see
things through different eyes."

Sandy also sees younger un-

dergraduates through different eyes,

   
   

According to Deal, 66 percent of the students in her program are bet-

although she is young enough that in
a sweater and jeans she looks “pretty
much like everyone else."

‘‘In my mass communications
class, the other students—l'd say the
mean age was 19—spent too much
time discussing whether Nixon's
book should be allowed to be

published. My feeling was, ‘well, it's

a free country.’

“Of course, when I was that age,
my opinions about issues, such as
the Vietnam War, were just as
vehement,” Sandy continued.

Students seem more self-
centered and competitive to Sandy

. than those in the early 1970's.

“College now seems to be an ex-
tension of high school, while master's
programs and professional schools
have taken over the function of
college,'' she said.

It is partially for this reason that
Sandy's attitude toward grades has
changed. ,

“Because I want to go to med
school, C's and B's aren't good
enough for me. I have to get A's,"
she said. ‘‘I do feel a lot of
pressure—on my first test here I
freaked—but I have learned to cope

with it." .

When she describes the type of
doctor she would like to be, however,
Sandy seems quite idealistic.

“l've seen a lot of doctors, both
competent and incompetent. I'd like
to do a little better. Most doctors

ween the ages of 30-49. The average age of General Studies students is S
24, Kaplan said. The students in both programs are heterogenous, ranging
from homemakers and blue-collar workers to established businessmen and

professionals.

Students returning to college are following younger undergraduates into
career-oriented fields such as thehealth-related professions and social

work.

In SGS, Kaplan reported, the most popular majors are business and pre-
engineering, while interest in liberal arts is declining. She said majors in
psychology and economics are becoming more popular due to their “viable

nature for people in business.”

Few who stop out of school regret their decision, according to many
academic advisors, and most feel the time spent working -helps clarify their
career goals and to define their educational expectations. ‘

In the following profiles, four students who are resuming their studies
discuss their reasons for returning to school and their new attitudes and '

«expectations.

Dan feels he has gained from college
is Intangible—a sense of personal
growth.

“When I came to school, my range
of possibilities opened up," said Dan,
35, a senior in the School of General
Studies and a sound engineer at

KDKA radio. “Before, I felt rutted in‘

my career. Being exposed to hew
people in a new setting made me take
inventory of myself and start Ieaming
who I was and what would satisfy
me.” -

Dan describes himself as “a

_ technical person who, later in life,

decided to pursue things he was in--

. terested in.” He initially took a radio

job as a creative way to apply the
electronics skills he learned in the
Army. '

“l was attracted to the show
business aspects of radio,” Dan said.
‘‘I hoped to become a disc jockey.
But from being on the air as a fill-in (at
a station in his home town of Wor-
chester, Mass.), I realized how
shallow that interest was. I also
realized I wasn't capable of giving the
product that was expected."

When Dan became a production
manager at Pittsburgh's KQV radio,

his creative interests shifted, from .

broadcasting to writing.— ‘‘I wrote,
produced spots and got very involved
in the station. Then, there was a
change in programming. I left KQV to
takea passive position at KDKA."

Dan's attitude toward school
changed soon after moving to KDKA.
He initially intended to take a few
courses at Pitt to discipline his
writing. Then he earned 48 credits
from CLEP ‘(College Level

Examination Program) and started to
pursue a self-designed com-
munications. major. V

“Realizing that a degree was in
reach gave me more confidence,"
Dan said.

“The support of his family also
gave Dan confidence. His wife and
two children, aged nine and 11, are
enthusiastic about his schooling,
although he had doubts about how
college would affect his life.

‘‘It took a long time for me to over-
come the idea that, if I switch careers
after finished college, my family will
suffer," Dan said.

“One advantage of college is
having more things in common with
my children, such as anxieties about
school and report cards," he added.

‘Dan said he has enjoyed all of his
courses at Pitt because they have
tied in to his interests. There has
been a definite change in Dan's goals
since he took hisfirst writing class,
however. History of Social Work is
one course he is looking forward to
this term.

   
   

 

NC’:

A spiritual awakening is a major . .

factor in the change in Dan's per-
spective on his life and career. He
has become a member of The Pitts-
burgh Experiment, a group of local
businessmen who meet weekly to

discusstheir personal problems and’ -

the way inwhich Christ has made a
difference in their lives.

"In this group, the usually super-
ficial conversation between men -
such as talk about sports — becomes
deep,” Dan said. ‘‘I really have come
to care for these people, and to

believe that Christ has a personal in- _

terest in my life. rm still a skeptic, and
I consider organized churches as
something ’of- a threat. Once I was
changed by the Christian experience,

however, I wanted to tell others S

about it. "

B _ The difficulties he has experien-

ced in communicating his new found
faith to others led Dan to try to cap-
ture the intimate conversation of The
Pittsburgh Experiment on tape.

“Books don't let people become
aware of a message as directly as
tapes do," said Dan. “A tape recor-
ding is like speaking on front of a
group; after the initial self-
consciousness, some interesting
words come out.

”In challenging people to write their
own creed, to put their faith in their
own words, growth is achieved. ‘f

An independent study course last

year gave Dan the opportunity to-

make a demonstration tape of the
ways in which a church, a retreat
house and an evangelist express
their spiritual messages.

He eventually would like to form a
tape production company devoted to
recording and distributing such "con-
versations, perhaps in V conjunction
with church groups.

“A degree, in itself-, is not my goal.

Growth is my goal, Dan said

Around the Country in Sixty Days T

By GARY GOVERT

Faddists take note: roller skating
is all the rage in San Francisco. Along
the streets bordering that city's
Golden Gate Park, Sunday afternoon
entrepreneurs are renting van-loads
of wheeled shoes to long lines of Bay
Area rollerheads. The going rate in
mid-July was one dollar per pair, and
the market was bullish.

Inside the park, the sidewalks are
unsafeat any speed. Longhairs in
knee-socks and
knickers virtually rule many of the
park's sloping walkways, and
pedestrians who are not light on their
feet are apt to wind up in the lap of
the nearest lotus-positioned
meditator. To make matters worse,
more than a few of the skaters have
little experience at turning or stop-'
ping, and their screams only add to
the general disquiet. Blind corners
are especially bad.

All this, of course, is by way of
saying that—given the prevailing winds

’ of fashion—it should only be a matter of »

several months before Pitt students are
careening down the hill from the
Stadium, past (and into) the hospitals,
wheels whirring and clicking over
cracks in the sidewalks.

San Francisco's newest form of
self-expression—an evolutionary by-
product of the infamous electric Kool-
Aid acid tests, no doubt—came to my
attention this summer while my wife,
Patsy, and I were visiting the Bay
City. Our several days in that area
were just one part of a two-month trip
to the West Coast and back, a trip
covering 9,279 miles and 21-states,
all of them successfully negotiated in
an overloaded and somewhat under-
designed 1974 Ford Pinto.

‘It was ajourney long planned and .

much anticipated. For several months
prior to our June 20th departure
we saved what money we could (and
ended up decimating our savings ac-
count anyway); we gathered infor-
mation on the national parks, contac-
ted friends and relatives in strategic
locations, and mapped out a tentative
route. The school where my wife
teaches biology closed for the sum-
mer on June 9th, spring session at
Pitt ended 10 days later, and the
next morning we were on the road.
We did not intend the trip to be a

remake of Zen and the Art of Motor-
cycle Maintenance, ‘and it wasn't.
There were no epiphanies on the
agenda, and none snuck upon us.

We wished only to travel, to see
places we had not seen before, to
leave the pressures of the year just
finished behind. Patsy had never
before been west of Champaign,
Illinois, and l—well, I had seen the
southern desert of Iran, but I'd never

, been to Utah (although some say the

two are roughly comparable).

Leaving Pittsburgh, we traveled
southwest, passing through Arkansas
an.d Oklahoma on our _way to
In Colorado Springs we
met two friends from back East, and
plans were made for a weekend of
backpacking in the San Isabel
National Forest, high in the Rockies
southwest of Denver. Food was
bought and rationed on a Thursday
night, and the next afternoon, June
30th, we hiked out of Hancock, an
abandoned mining camp about
10,000 feet up the eastern slope of
the Continental Divide. The rotting

ties of the old Transcontinental

Railroad marked our first trail, and we
made our camp that evening in a pine
grove not far from where, years
earlier, immigrant laborers had cut
through the mountains on their way to
the golden spike. Sunset over the
Divide was predictably splendrous,
and, after deciding to climb nearby
Mt. Chapman (elev. 12,784) the next
morning, we settled in for the coldest
night anyone could ever care to
spend in a sleeping bag.

Dawn greeted us with a sheet of

ice on our tent fly. Breakfast was a .
» dismal affair, best described in terms
of bone-rattling shivers, and anything

involving the conjunction of water and
skin, such as washing, was» un-

thinkable. We broke camp. and star-

ted walking, briskly, as soon as we
could.

By 9:30 we had reached Hancock

-Pass, some 700‘feet in elevation and

a mi|e’s distance from the peak of Mt.
Chapman. We left the jeep trail we
had been following all morning and

started at an angle across the face of _

the mountain. Climbing slowly, over
loose rocks and melting snowfields,
we could see a long distance down
the valley where we had camped the
night before. The sun shone like a
sparkler in the thin, clear air.

Breathing was difficult and we had to

‘rest every few yards, but finally, near

_1 1 :00, Patsy scrambled over the last
windrow of snow and was the first to
reach the summit.

We ate our lunch perched on the
backbone of the continent. Around

.us, snow-capped, jagged peaks

ringed the horizon. Cumulus clouds

. warmed by themorning sun were

beginning to drift over our heads,
rising from the lower elevations to the
west, where they had spent the
freezing night. More than a thousand
feet below us, scrub pines at the
highest reaches‘ of the timberline
stood in gnarled testimony of the

-mountains’ harshness. yet, in the

meadows that reached beyond the
trees, tiny wildflowers riffled in the
wind. Phlox, bluet, cinquefoil and

' sunflowers covered the mountainside

like a patchwork quilt—blue, yellow,
pink and white—a better garden than
any man has made.

anu-

The drive from Colorado to Los
Angeles was a whirlwind of
shameless tourism: Mesa Verde,
Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon and
Zion national parks—not to mention
the KOA Kampground in Las
Vegas—all in four days. We arrived in
sunny Southern California just as the
worst inversion of the summer was
building to a climax, and the air was
like hydrocarbon soup all the way out
to San‘ Bernardino, miles from. the
coast. Accustomed as we were to
the pristine breezes of Pittsburgh,
our eyes burned and we both got
headaches.

Los.Ang’eles marked the beginning
of nearly three weeks in ‘Califor-
nia—20 days of urban sprawl, rocky
coasts, magnificent forests and
cultural contradictions. In Malibu,
sun-glazed California dreamers
champagne brunched at an outdoor
cafe, their bracelets tinkling on cut-
glass carafes; across the street,
poodles tinkled on a filthv beach; At
Disneyland we waited in line to have
fun, and during our Great Moments

with Mr. Lincoln—sponsored,
ironically, by the Gulf Oil Cor-
poration—an animated figure of
Honest Abe exhorted us to “make
reverence for the law the political
religion of America."

In San Francisco we rode it the
much maligned. Bay Area Rapid Tran-
sit system and found it rather to our
liking, although a bit expensive. We
visited Alcatraz:

number one tourist attraction. 'We
discovered that there are still lots of

what we used to call “freaks" in the T, I

Bay Area (among them several roller
skating afficionados), although‘ the

rebirth of conservatism in the last few’ ,-
years seems to have cut into their -

number. We looked (as all visitors
must) for evidence of San Fran-
cisco's supposedly ubiquitous gay
community, but we detected nothing
out of the ordinary, "save a few bus-
side advertisements for the city's
non-homophobic newspaper, predic-
tably named The Advocate.

California's Yosemite National
Park, with its waterfalls and barren
granite mountains, was probably the
single most beautiful place we saw

’ during those two months of traveling

and camping-and it was very nearly
the most densely populated. But we
escaped the humanity-infested
“ground floor," as it is called, and
spent four days in the high country,
cultivating the illusion of wilderness.
The illusion proved difficult to main-
tain, though, when we were forced to
detour through the underbrush one
.day in order to avoid a camper.-wise
bear that was greedy for our granola.

***

Speaking of illusions—there has ’

been a lot in the news lately about a
“financial crisis in the middle class."

Suddenly, conservative intellectuals _ t
like Howard Jarvis are ascendent, 
and principled gentlemen like Jerry

Brown are falling all over themselves
in their zeal to serve the needy

majority among the electorate.‘
Proposition 13 has given new hope I
(i.e., disposable income) to the .

home-owning oppressed.
But how, I wonder, do Messrs.

Jarvis and Brown account for I

“recreational vehicles?"

Although particularty plentiful in , ;
California, these vans, trailers, cam-" _ _

pars and tract homes on wheels are,

in a word, everywhere. Major high-’ -

Students Bridge Gap Between Life and School

(Continued from page 4)

“I had the best of both worlds,”
Ann, 45 recalled. ‘‘I helped my
husband to build up his business—a
funeral home—yet retained my
freedom."

Her husband's death in a plane
crash 11 years ago changed Ann's
plans. Despite advice to sell the
funeral home, she obtained a
“widow's licence,” with which she
could continue to oeprate the home
with the help of a supervisor.

“I felt that I had to carry on for my
three daughters, who had already
suffered one trauma," said Ann. “I
also wanted to show that I could do
it."

The same spirit of challenge
prompted Ann's return to school.
She is beginning her second year of
CAS courses at Pitt, after which she
will attend two years of mortuary
school. Her goal is a funeral direc-
tor’s license of her own.

“As you grow older, you tend to
fall into a comfortable niche," said

Ann. "You lose the need to learn with ~

fervor. College, to me, is a new ad-
‘venture.
dously."

Pressure to succeed has not
spoiled the adventure of college for
Ann.

"Since I have my business, I don't
have to worry about the job market. I
also don't have to answer to anyone,
as younger students answer to their
parents. And I've learned that there
are more important things in the world
than one test.

“Getting good grades is a wonder-
ful feeling, though," Ann said.

Ann did have anxieties about
coming to Pitt.

“I hadn't been to school since I at-
tended business school .27 years

ago," she said. ‘‘I have a business V

and a large home to manage, and
don't have the time to devote to study
that many younger students do. I
was also afraid I'd be the only person

I of my age in class.

"|'ve always felt at ease, though.
I've also developed warm relation-
ships with other students. Many
have said to me, ‘I wish my mother
would do what you're doing.’ ”

Ann's daughters—a ‘Duquesne
graduate, a junior at Miami University
of Ohio and a high school fresh-
man—-have also been supportive of
her return to school. ‘

“When my middle daughter was
home on vacation, we discussed
economics and other subjects," said
Ann. “My daughters keep telling me
that I can do anything."

Her funeral home staff assisted
Ann in the task of finding study time.

"My business is unpredictable:
we can be busy one week and idle
the next,” Ann said. “My staff was
very helpful when tests and business
coincided."

Pitt's Office of Continuing
Education for Women also has made
Ann's adjustment to college smooth.

“The people there are aware that
you lead a busy life, and are very ac-
commodating. They help you with
scheduling and handle registration,"
Ann said. .

Ann expressed surprise at the dif-
ferences between the academic at-
mospheres of 1950 and 1978.

“It was a shock the first time one
of my professors came to class in a T-
«shirt and cutoffs,” she said. “And I
was surprised at the openness of
students. In one of my classes, a
prof said to a girl, ‘You look bored.’

She answered, ‘I am. This is a boring .

  
     

I have enjoyed it tremen- .

class. .

“When I was young, you didn't talk
like that to a teacher unless you were
looking to be expelled!”

Ann said she would like to earn a
liberal arts degree at Pitt after
finishing mortuary school. Although
she has enjoyed courses from Italian
to economics, psychology would be
her first choice as a major because “it
would help me in my work."

“I am taking a course in death,
dying and immortality this year," Ann
said. ‘‘It will cover funeral customs
around the world. I would also like to
take courses that deal with grief.

“It’s a great feeling to help
someone who is grief-stricken," Ann
continued. “I try to show widows,
especially, that their lives aren't over
because their husbands have died."

- Ann said her self-image has
changed since she returned to
school

“I think of myself now as able to
compete against anvone ”

 

“If someo e had told me a few
years ago that I was going to be a
nurse, I'd have told him he was out of
his mind,” said John Willis.

Iiconomics was the 23-year-old’s
major when he transferred to Pitt

from Allegheny Community College in
January, 1977.

‘ He quickly became disillusioned
with both economics and the Univer-
sity.

‘‘I have no ‘Florence Nightingale"
philosophy of nursing, though. I like
nursing mainly becauseit provides a
lot of mobility. I could work anywhere
in the country,” he added.

“Pitt seemed to Gothic to me—as
if it could swallow you up,” John said.
'‘I also decided I didn't like econ at all.
I really didn't have too many econ
courses at Community College.

“Then I got sick, which gave me a
convenient excuse to leave school.”

After leaving Pitt, John lived for a
time in Oregon, where his parents
have relocated. Although he liked
“the calmness" of that area, he retur-
ned to Pittsburgh. He now lives in his

home community of Brentwood with

an aunt.

“lt’s difficult to start over unless
you have a job or another strong
reason for relocating,” John said.
“So I decided to give up the fight and
come home." ’ . .

John said he may eventually move
back to Oregon.
When John took a job at Jefferson
‘County Hospital in Coal Valley, he
was interested in making money, not
in‘ a medical career. His work as a
materials handling logistics technician
put him in close contact‘ with nurses
A (whom he assists with‘ hospital
equipment) and patients. He began
to consider nursing as a profession.

"At first, working in the hospital is
depressing. Then it becomes
John said.

A year away from school—he has
registered as a CAS student for fall
term—has affected John's attitudes

toward college as well as career. His

,aversion to Pitt has disappeared

along with his dream of becoming “an
F. Lee Bailey-type lawyer."

‘‘I'm not as quite idealistic as I
used to be," he said. “When I started
at Community College, I wanted to be
educated for the sake of education .
Studying made me feel rich inside.

“Now, studying has come down to
push and shove, and I'm looking for
the things an education can get me."

John said he felt no pressure from
his family to return to _school,
although he will receive financial sup-
port from them to complete his
education.

“I grew up in a laboring com-
munity," he explained. ‘‘I was 10
years old before I met a college
graduate, other than my teachers.
My best friend's father worked in the
mill.” V ~
The blue-collar atmosphere of
Brentwood has, paradoxically, in-
fluenced John to finish college.

“A college background is a
detriment there, in a way,” he said.
“The people who didn't go to college
tend to feel inferior to you.

_ “And, every time you walk into the
ml". the gas company or the water

tC°mDal'iy. you realize that your

Changes to get in are very slim.

Unless you know someone or your -

application fails at the feet of the right
person, you won't get a job.”

John, who will spend this term
taking some needed chemistry cour-
ses, said he has no apprehensitns
about returning to college.

“In a way, going to school is like
riding a bike,” he said. “You never
forget how to do it."

'How I Spent M

(Continued from page 5)

campsites with "hookups" (elec-
tricity, etc.) are eagerly sought.

Now, concerning the relationship
of the ‘‘RV'’ to the imagined financial
woes of our great middle class (of

_ which I am a bonafide member, born

and bred in the appropriate tax
brackets), it strikes me ‘ that we
bulwarks of society must not be that
badly off if-so many of us can afford
to wheel around in our bedrooms..
Trailers, motor homes and the like are

’ » expensive.

And after all, who is out there in all
those mobile monuments to afflu-
ence? Certainly not the poor—and I
suspect that few among the monied
elite would suffer themselves to be
found in a Minnie Winnie.

.**‘k

Leaving California we traveled nor-

« th, stopping at Crater Lake and Port-

land, Oregon, on our way to
Washington's Olympic National Park
There, we camped for two days and
nights on the westernmost coast of

' the continental United States, just

south of the Straits of Juan de Fuca
and Canada's Vancouver island.

Having reached the point at which
.we had no choice but to turn east, we
decided one morning to take the ferry
across Puget Sound, from Port

Townsend to Whidby Island. It was a

cold, typically drizzly forenoon, and
we arrived at the pier in Port Town-
send just in time to see the ferry
churning up the gray waters of the

‘ Sound, 100 yards from the dock,

outbound. it would be, we were told,
an hour and a half before the ferry
returned for another load.

After I finished my tantrum, we
walked down to the Waterfront Cafe,
a smallish place with large windows
overlooking the Sound. Homemade
vegetable soup and herbal tea issued
forth from the kitchen, and when we
had eaten our fill, we set out to ex-
plore Port Townsend.

It turned out to be a rather literary
sort of place. Connected to the cafe
was a bookstore of the progressive
persuasion, marketing copies of The
Nation, Small is Beautiful, Diet for a
Small Planet and Pilgrim at Tinker
Creek, to name only a few. There
were shiny-jacke.ted hardbacks,
“how-to” paperbacks on macrame
and solar energy tracts. It was,
among other things, a safe place for
middle-aged tourists from Iowa.

Melville & Co., a used-book store
down the street, was something else
altogether. Plastered on the show
window were such things un-Middle
‘American as anti-nuclear power
statements, Save the Porpoise
-petitions and a pronouncement of
‘anathema on the Trident submarine.
A poster urging patrons to boycott
Dow Chemical Company was
prominently displayed. (it seems that
Dow is back in the defoliant business,
this time in cahoots with the U.S.
Forest Service rather than the army).
There was even an article clipped
from The Texas Observer that in-
volved big hogs swimming in the swill
trough, starving little pigs, and the
failure of both classical and

Keynesian agricultural theory to
provide an answer to the problem.

Taken in toto, the Melville & Co.
window seemed to reflect many of
the values held clear by those among
my contemporaries who are attracted
to seaside places like Port Townsend
—-a sort of anti-technology “eco-

culture” that views the world and its
problems in ways that are often both
reflexive and eminently wise. It is a
kind of philosophy that strongly ap-
peals to me, but it is one I'm afraid I
could never whole-heartedly em-
brace; for all its straightfonivardness
and us-against-them simplicity, such
a philosophy seems to have just too
little room for the maddening am-
biguities of modern life. ' -

We made it across Puget Sound in
the early afternoon, and from Whidby
Island it was pretty much a straight
shot across the North Cascades
Mountains and into the sunbaked
ranchlands of eastern Washington. A’
discount motel in the ‘decidedly
forgettable town of Omak provided us
a night's shelter-—it was by now
August, and I was getting in-

creasingly weary of setting up the

tent—and the next day we hurried

across the Idaho panhandle to -

and for the next several years he and

Audrey worked to fashion a living ~

from their investment. They hunted,
raised livestock and coaxed a garden
from the unproductive soil. in the
winter they brought newborn lambs
into the pumphouse to keep them
from freezing. It was, they say,
rather like homesteading.

Today, the mortgage on the farm
is paid off and a proper house is
finally being built. The land still sup-
ports more knapweed and ground
squirrels than anything else, but the
cattle and sheep are prospering and
the barn is full of hay. Gary now
works as an independent logging

contractor, still tending the farm in his-

“spare time." Caught, as are most‘
family farmers these days, between
corporate farming’s competitive ad-
vantage and consumer groups’ self-
interested political dominance, the
Flockerzis cannot yet make a living on

western Montana. Here, in the valley
of the Clark Fork River, nestled bet-
ween the Bitteroot and Cabinet
mountain ranges, we spent some of
the best days of the summer.

‘A'**

Fourteen years ago, Gary
Flockerzi— my wife's father's
cousin,—-left Pennsylvania in a 1958
Chevy, determined to go as far as the
car and $250 could take him. He
ended up in Great Falls,‘ Montana,
where for five years he worked in a
copper smelter for the Anaconda
Company. In 1969, at the age of 32,
he married Audrey Hanley and
bought a 300-acre farm, mostly tim-
ber, about 90 miles northwest of
Missoula.

The farm had been abandoned for
some time, and it lacked many of the
usual amenities; it did not, for instan-
ce, include a house. When Gary and
Audrey moved in that year, they took
shelter in what had once been the
pumphouse. The pump no longer
worked, though, and fresh water had
to be carried in from off the property.

Gary took a job in the local sawmill,

their 300 acres alone. But in spite of
the. long hours and lack of financial
reward, they seem to have every in-
tention of staying on the farm for the
rest of their lives.

i had never met the Flockerzis
prior to our visit, and when we turned
into their “driveway"—actually a small

parking lot containing two cars‘, two.

motorcycles, one pickup truck and a
prehistoric flatbed Ford—-l wasn't at
all sure how long we would want to
stay. The new home was still just a
hole in the ground, and the old one
reminded me of some places I'd seen
in southern Appalachia. A welcoming
committee of five howling dogs- was
on hand to greet us, and it wasn't until
Gary emerged from behind the house
that we felt it was safe to get out of
the car.

Relatively safe, that is. Gary, at
that particular moment, looked like he
might just as well have come outfrom
under the old pumphouse as from
behind it. The half-torn-off brim of his
cowboy hat was pulled low over his
eyes and a 10-day beard darkened
his face. His clothes were dirty and
specked with sawdust. Squinting at

ySummer Vacation’ Revisited  

us, he looked like a grumpy redneck
if ever I saw one.

But Gary wasn't really grumpy at
all—just tired. He had just come
home from a day of “woods work,”
he said, and he was waiting to eat
supper before starting in on the

V evening chores. We sat down in the

shade behind the house and talked
for a while—about the farm, the
weather, the" mountains around
us—and then Audrey called us in to a
delicious supper of elk steaks.

That. first evening passed in easy
conversation, and then one hot,
cloudless day began to follow
another. While Gary worked in the
woods, we loafed around the farm,
riding the horses and studying animal
behavior. (i learned, for example,
that sheep like to be, scratched
behind the ears, but geese won't let
you put your hands anywhere near
their necks). In the evenings we

spotted elk and picked huckleberriesv

in the mountains, swam and fished for
brook trout in the valley. Gary stayed

. home one day, and we brought 400

bales of hay into the barn—nine tons
by my reckoning, including dust and
baling twine.

We left the Flockerzis on a Mon-
day morning, and we left reluctantly,
to say the least. Western Montana is
magnificent country, a clean, wide-
open kind of place, and parting was
sad. But‘ responsibilities—|arge|y
forgotten‘ for nearly two months
now—were calling us home. The
temptation was to ignore them, for-
sake the city forever, and take a jobin
the woods; but either good sense
triumphed or courage failed, because
we turned again to the highway.

We traveled 2,600 more miles
before we reached home, but the trip
was essentially over by the time we

_left Montana. Driving through Min-
neapolis, and then Chicago, we were

' reintroduced to the meaning of

modern industrial civilization: sud-

-denly there was traffic again, and

smog. The sun went down on our trip
like a red lantern behind the shim-
mering curtain of automobile exhaust
that rose from Interstate 80. I began
to wonder whether we weren't just a

little bit masochistic, because as we i

got closer to Pittsburgh we began to
talk like we were glad to be getting
back. We drove through Ohio,
crossed the Pennsylvania line, hit a
monstrous pothole and were home.

And-—smog, traffic and potholes
notwithstanding—we were glad to be
home. Two months on,’ the road,
living out of a trunk, is a long time, and
we were tired. We had not seen,
everything—the West is far, far too
big for that—but we had seen
enough. There comes a point when a
sort of sensory overload sets in,
when seeing any more is just ‘glut-
tony, and we had reached that point.

So coming home was good, as
leaving was good. But coming home
was not, as someromantic writers
might have us believe, ‘any better than
leaving. l have already said that there
were no epiphanies on our agenda,
and that none snuck up on us. The
trip did, however, provide additional
confirmation for something I have
long believed. It proved again that no
matter how many times people tell
themselves “there’s no place, like
home,” it's still just a lot of wishful
thinking.

blazing and lyrical hard rock tunes

album “Live and Dangerous”) in

sold-out Stanley Theater.

He could also be found seated at

band’s position -currently in the
music business.

“In England, Thin Lizzy in the
last few years has_ grown to
superstar status,” said _ Lynott,
“and we had gotten quite used to
and expected the star treatment
after all the hard work we had put
in throughout the early- and
mid-70s. However. last year on our
ﬁrst uninterrupted headline tour of
America, we foundthat we were
playing to a lot of empty seats in
quite a few markets.”_ '

w This time out, Lizzy has opted for
headlining the smaller theaters in
areas where they are strong, such_
as Philadelphia and Detroit, while
.opening many shows for the likes
of Blue Oyster Cult, Journey and
Steve Miller before larger audi-
ences.

‘ ‘But Seriously, Folks’ ’ is Joe Walsh’s first solo effort since he joined

the Eagles two years ago.

the album is a landmark in Walsh’s

career, revealing his maturation while still exhibiting the fresh, lively

spirit that won him wide acclaim.

Songs like ‘ ‘Over and Over’ ’ and “Second Hand Store” show Walsh’s
afﬁnity for melody, yet they retain his characteristic strength and drive.
Eagles Don Henley, Glenn Frey and Tim Schmit pitch in on background

vocals, creating pleasing harmonies.

“Indian “Summer” and “Tomorrow” are performed in the same vein. '
Walsh ’ s performance on guitar is, amazingly versatile———at times soft. and
sweet-sounding, at others, hard and gutsy. Always present, though, is
an excellent sense of composition and arrangement.

On the uptempo side, ‘fAt the Station” exhibits drive and bravado, _
with Walsh’s guitar and vocals leading the way. “Theme From Boat

Weirdos” follows as a ﬁnely tuned instrumental.

The best song is

“Life’s Been Good,” which is a wry jab at the pretentiousness of ,
rockstardom. While musically sound (Walsh’s guitar and vocal work
shine here), it is the sardonic lyrics of the song that grab the_listener-

“I had enough conﬁdence in Erv

g Paferno ’s Happy   Valley Express Could Stall in Columbus

Then came the Temple game, which Penn State "Penn State today is an undefeated team with more

a poor team that forced the Nits to kick four field 7
goals. And with the team’s terribly shaky 2-0 record

came the anger, disappointment and, above all,

Joe Paterno, figuring this season might be a roller-
coaster ride at Happy Valley, constructed a track that
would allow his team to climb to the top of its game,
then roll down with ‘momentum and might on an
Ohio State team that was not yet in gear. But after a
pair of near-derailments against Temple and Rutgers
that left Penn‘ State shaken instead of thrilled,
Paterno’s team must wobble into Columbus Satur-
day to face an Ohio State team that Woody Hayes

“They can move the ball a little,” the sports writer ‘
said, “but not score. Getting the ball close enough
for Bahr won’t do in Columbus.” i
Paterno may remedy that by opening up his offen- 1
se. It is more than possible that Paterno, not wishing 1
to give Ohio State good filmiand not believing he'd '1
need to be flashy to win his first two games, held 1
back against Temple and Rutgers. An end-around 1
with ﬂanker Tom Donovan once .~_was a favorite play 51
of Paterno’s, but neither team Penn State has beaten ‘
saw much more than handoffs to backs. And Fusina {

worry that grips that once Happy Valley today.
“Things have changed in big ways up here,” a .
State College sports writer said yesterday. “This
season was the first time Paterno was optimistic; he
got people’s hopes up. .~.and now he regrets that.”
But the fans’ feelings are perhaps the least impor-
tant item on a growing list of worries possessed by
Paterno. His offense, expected to be a display of _
Chuck Fusina’s talents, has lived largely on the
strength of kicker Matt Bahr’s foot. His defense, ap-
parently, will be called upon to keep its team in a
"position from which to beat the Buckeyes. And it will. 1

seemed to be a wise move by a wisecoach priming for
a run at the top. He took Temple and Rutgers, a pair
of patsies, and invited them to a couple of early
September Massacres.

‘ The idea was to allow the Lions (ranked second in
the country by Sports Il1ustr'ated)»a two-week period
in which they could gain confidence and the proper
spirit while making minor adjustments in their game.

Paterno attracted "early attention by abandoning
his usual pre-season rhetoric and assuming the role of

changes. His behavior already has been affected by
PSU’s rocky start. Paterno told his players—in front
of reporters—not to talk about the OSU game last
week, then threw all writers out of the dressing room. 4
And he has become less accessible, something like the

In the past, Pitt’s cross country
team could count on one of two
runners to pull out a ﬁrst-place
ﬁnish or two. But now, with the
graduation of Mel Boyd and Dave
McDonald, qualiﬁers for last fall’s
NCAA championships, Pitt coach
Mike Agostinella says it will take
“a group effort” for his team to
survive. .

“We don’t have the individual
stars like we’ve had,” said
Agostinella, entering his fourth
season as Panther coach. “We’re
counting on some of our returning

BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP)-
Was he running or was he trying to
pass?

That was the controversial
question Monday night surround-
ing the Minnesota Vikings’ 12-9
overtime victory over Denver in
which the Broncos were allowed to
line up for a game-tying ﬁeld goal
after time "had apparently run out.

With the Vikings ahead, 916,
reserve quarterback Norris Weese
brought the Broncos down to the
Minnesota 5-yard line, with 11
seconds left and Denver out of time
outs.

Weese rolled to his right and was
dumped for a loss with three
seconds showing on the clock.
Minnesota felt it had the game
won, but referee Don Wedge
stopped the clock, giving Jim
Turner time to get his kick off
successfully and force the over-

time.”

_ “Anytime the quarterback is
sacked trying to pass behind the
line of scrimmage, the clock is
stopped, the ball is spotted and the
clock doesn’t start again until
players from both-teams are lined

. passing.

up,” explained Wedge.

But the Vikings were livid,
claiming Weese was running a
bootleg and had no thoughts of
Minnesota Coach Bud
Grant, shedding. his conservative,
stoneface image, burst onto the
ﬁeld to confront Wedge.

“He (Wedge) was just about
incoherent when I_ got there,” said
Grant ‘of the mayhem which
followed. “He was asking for help
from other ofﬁcials. I

“There is no explanation to my
way of thinking. He was running
all the way. With three seconds to
go how can you put a bal Lin play
and get the kicking team on the
ﬁeld?” he asked.

Weese, who replaces starter
Craig. Morton, admitted that he
was running. '

-“I was running a quarterback
bootleg and I slipped,” he said.
“Fortunately for us it was called a
sackl”

Minnesota quarterback Fran
Tarkenton, who suffered a bruised
thumb and left the game in favor of
Tommy Kramer in the Vikings’
ensuing sudden death drive,

 filled Panther preview.

offered further explanation.

“When the ofﬁcials visited our
training camp in August we were
told that a passing play becomes a
running play when the quarterback
leaves the pocket,” he said. “That
generally is the area between the
tackles. Weese was way out of the
pocket. ~ ' _ .

“Some of the officialssaid I was
right, and that the clock should
have rundown. But» the head
ofﬁcial (Wedge) wouldn’t change
his mind.”

Wedge said he told Tarkenton
that when‘Weese raised his arm it
became a pass and that it didn't
matter if he had left the pocket.

Under NFL rules, an automatic
time out is called “...from the time
an intended passer is downed
behind the line until all players
involved in a clearly intended pass
have had reasonable time ‘to

- reassemble. ”

Kramer engineered Minnesota's

drive to the Denver 26, where free

agent Rick Danmeier kicked his
fourth ﬁeld goal of the night-—_a
44-yarder—to give the -Vikings
their first victory of the season.

Ali’s Noodle ls Fight Key

Muhammad Ali boasts that his
physical condition is better than it's
been for several years. That and
Ali’s wits are the key in his bid to
beat heavyweight champion Leon
Spinks, says Angelo Dundee.

“I see it as a very tough ﬁght,”
Dundee, who has worked in_ Ali’s
corner for all of his pro ﬁghts, said
yesterday of the World Boxing
Association heavyweight title bout
in the Superdome Friday Night.

“I see it as a 15-round ﬁght. I

_-don't see any knockdowns. I see it

I" 5’ as the survival of the ﬁttest...and I

know my guy is ﬁt.”

One unusual aspectof this ﬁght is
that it is Ali who will have to change
his style, rather than his opponent.
In many of his ﬁghts Ali has made

his -opponent play his game. In Las ,

Vegas last Feb. 15, Spinks beat Ali
at Ali’s game and won the world

This time Spinks expects Ali to be
more aggressive, rather than trying
to make Spinks tire himself. “I
expect him to come stronger,” the
champion said. “He wants it back
bad...and I want to keep it just as
bad.” ’

“It ain’t the trick to wait for the
guy to empty his gas tank, ” Dundee
said of Ali’s ﬁrst ﬁght tactics, which
were to make Spinks punch himself
out in the early rounds. “The gas
tark is full. He's 25-years-old.”

.cn Dundee tapped his head
with a ﬁnger and said, ‘ ‘This is what
is going to lick Spinks. It’s going to
be the noodle. He (Ali) is going to
have to ﬁght a smart, calculated
ﬁght.”

Spinks, who will weigh some 20
pounds less than Ali‘ but has
tremendous upper body strength,

and pressure his 36-year-old
opponent

“There ain’t a man in the world
that can beat Muhamhad Ali in
boxing,” said Spinks, “because
then he’s ﬁghting at his range.”
Ali, who has an 80-inch reach, four

more inches than Spinks, has,

preferred to fight at arms length but
as he has grown older this has been
increasingly difficult to do.

Spinks is taking nothing for
granted. He has brought George
Benton‘back into his camp to help
trainer Sam Solomon devise
strategy for the fight. It was
Benton who got Spinks to pound Ali
on the left shoulder everytime Ali

‘ went into a defensive shell in the

ﬁrst ﬁght. This tactic took the snap
out of Ali’s famed left jab as the
