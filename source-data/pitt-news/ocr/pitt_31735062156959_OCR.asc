The proposed amendment has
been falsely labelled “proportion-
al representation” by those who,
for their own selﬁsh ends, Wish
to see it defeated. Its sponsors
-have nexfter pretended that it is
anything of the kind. Actually it
is a compromise between true
proportional representation and
the present half-and-half set—up.
To allow women their due» voice
under proportional representa-
tion would require a Congress too
large to function efficiently. The
compromise amendment would
insure ample expression of the
women’s viewpoint While pro-
viding enough male representation
to guarantee that the opinions of
the majority of the student body
would prevail.

Senior "A Court, the judiciary
body of WSGA, has sent a state-
ment to senior mentors and fresh-
man guild advisors urging them to
persuade: freshman women to vote
against the amendment. That the
statement was signed -by Senior
Court rather than WSGA seems to
me extremely poor taste and the
most ﬂagrant example of indiscre-
tion by student leaders that I
have had the displeasure of wit-
nessing at Pitt. Senior Court with
its duties as an interpretive and
nominating body should remain
impartial. But let’s examine its
arguments. ' I

.First, says Senior Court, the
amendment would not fulﬁll the
purpose of Student Congressin
that it “would not promote best
interests of men and women in
their joint relations.” Why not?
It is Only logical that a better bal-
pnced representation would pro-
vide closer harmony in joint rela-
tions between men and women
because only in that way can a
majority vattitude be accurately
ascertained.

Secondly, they say that such a

By Charles Davis

It is truly gratifying to know
that on our Campus we have a
group of free thinking individ-
uals who have banded together to
devise a means for improving our
Student Government. This means
being a so called proportionality
of representation amendment to
the Student Congress constitution.

Unfortunately this group of
planners have utterly failed in
their purpose, to provide‘ a means
for true proportional representa-
tion. Their attempt based purely
on sex will not make for improve-

ment. Such an attempt based
purely on sex could _;not have
clearly and ‘ thoroughly -been

thought out; Had they taken the
time and trouble to investigate‘
the true meaning of proportional
representation, they could have
brought forth a true and desira-
ble means, not such a stupid
measure that Wil.l not answer the
problem"-but create a much worse
one if passed.

They could have very easily
checked on the S. C. membership
over the past four y_ears to ﬁnd
insofar as school representation is

ﬁve per cent of the members
came from the College, ﬁfteen per
cent ' from. Business Administra-
tionand ten per cent from Engi-
neering and Mines. Yet they cry
for proportional representation on
the feeble basis of sex. Can the
proponents of this measure not be
aware that there is not one stu-
dent on Congress/from Business
Administration and at this time
thirteen of the fourteen repre-
sentatives are from the College.

An interested and vigorous stu-
dent body will easily see through

ture proposal as being through
no stretch of the imagination
(even one ‘so vivid as Orson
Welles) a true and just means to
a desired end. ‘

_ Personally, tomorrow I am go-
ing to vote NO to this "anemic and
counterfeit move toward propor-
tional representation. To me pro-
portional representation means
assurance of representation from
_the College, Business Administra-
tion, Engineering and Mines as
well as publications, Pitt Players,
the band, Men’s Council, WSGA,
IF and Pan-Hel as well as other
major activities on campus. Let
there be an exepneded and more
representative Student Congress

In accordance with the constitution of the
Student Congress, The News prints the com-
plete “proportionality” amendment. The
amendment will be voted on by the student
body Wednesday, January 7, 1948.

“To amend Student Congress by-laws
by striking out Section I, Article III, -and
inserting: Section I, Student (member-
ship). There shall be ﬁfteen student mem-
bers of the Student Congress, ten men,
ﬁve women. The women shall be the Presi-
dent of the Womens Self-Government As-
sociation, ex-oﬂicio, two senior women and
two junior women elected by the women
at their annual elections. The men student
members shall be. the President of Mens
Council, ex-oﬂicio, a representative senior
from Mens Council elected by that or-
ganization from its membership, four
senior men and four junior men elected by
the men at their annual elections.’

. . . Yes or No?

The trite chance of a lifetime occurred just
prior to the holidays when a real political issue
made itself known on the Pitt Campus. To-
morrow, that issue comes to a slightly pre-
mature head with balloting, for or against, the
‘ ‘ proportional’ ’ representation amendment.

Actually, it is too bad that the holidays in-

tervened on what promised to be a good poli- "

tical slugfest. A few weak attempts were
made yesterday and today, along with the
debate this afternoon, to bring the issue be-
fore the student body.

As the picture stands now, the two large
representative organizations on campus have
acted, at a rather slowed pace, to propagandize
their constituents. Women’s Self Government
Assoication has sent to all women on the cam-
pus a collection of reasons why the amend-
ment should be rejected. We admire the taste
that the women in this group used in present-
ing what they considered‘ the advantages and
disadvantages of the bill. It is evident, how-
ever, that they would oppose the_bill. _

Men’s Council, at its last meeting before the
holidays, set up a Political Action Committee
to push passage of the amendment. Their at-
tack is through distributing printed matter
and the use of the telephone.

Although Men’s Council and WSGA have
tried to stir up interest on the amendment, it
appears, now, that only a small count will be

~ taken at the polls. Unless some strange miracle

occurs this afternoon or tomorrow, the great
independent and usually indiﬁerent vote will
remain untouched.

Certainly, the fraternities will be all out
to push it through. On the other side, a strong
_vote will come from the sororities and the in-
dependent women. With that count, the bill
should be defeated. V

The big question is the independent vote.

‘If it turns out, will it be in favor or against the

,7

issue? Our guess is that it will say “NO
probably without even voting. -

Thompson Approves

Back Issue is deleted in this edition to provide
more space for the continuation of a pro amend-
ment statement by Walt Thompson. We feel that
the full information concerning this question of
Student Congress representation should be placed
before the student body. This is not, necessarily, a
statement of Pitt News editorial policy.

(Continued from page _I)

medium for all student opinion.” Well, certainly,
we don’t have such a medium now in a Congress
where women are vastly over-represented and
men sadly under—represented. In this respect the
amendment could obviously be only an improve-
ment.

Finally, in the most juvenile contention of them
all, Senior Court says, “As representation is now,
we are similar to the House of Representatives
and the Senate.” The analogy is ridiculous. WSGA
legislates only on matters that pertain exclusive-
ly to women; similarly Men’s Council deals strict-

ly with men. Until these two bodies are empow-
ered to initiate legislation that affects both men;
and women, there can be no comparison with our!
bicameral federal system.

WSGA, which in the past has always turned
up its pious nose at politics and ‘claimed to be
above political action in any form, now turns its
back on its own tradition and leads the ﬁght to
kill the amendment in a desperate campaign with.
no holds barred. By sending a letter to all women
students requesting their negative vote on the
amendment, WSGA has gone so far as to misap-
propriate student funds for its own self-interested
purposes. Those letters were mailed at the ex-
pense of funds taken from student tuition, funds,
naturally, to which men contribute ﬁve times as
much as women.

,This from the same WSGA which earlier in
the semester found that it could not afford to
bear its due shade of the expense of mixed dances
and forced Men’s Council to carry the burden

favoring the amendment to all men students, but
felt that it could not with a clear conscience use
your money for such a purpose.

If men want their voice in campus affairs, they
will turn out at the polls tomorrow and demand
representation by a “Yes” vote to the amendment.

Only by a large male turnout at the polls
can the majorityof Pitt students secure its proper
voice in student government.

amendment is up before the student body. It
is for them to decide. Since the announcement

by Congress that the amendment will be de- ‘
bated openly, we feel that opinion could be _

evolved without bias at the timegof the debate.

As we see it, the amendmentcalls for an
elimination of the inﬂuence of the Dean of
Women. There are pros and cons on this sub-
ject. We do not feel qualiﬁed to stand on this
issue. We’d rather just watch.

Rubber accelerators lead the way
to new agricultural fungicides

Vulcanization accelerators for rubber
and agricultural fungicides would seem
to have little in common. But the wide
variety of interests of men in the Du
Pont organization sometimes result in
outstanding developments from such
apparently unrelated products.

A rubber chemist suggested to a plant
pathologist that derivatives of dithio-
carbamic acid, N H3-C (S)SH, iparent
substance of a well-known group of rub-
beraccelerators,betestedasinsecticides.
His suggestion was based on the possi-
bility that sulfur combined in this form
might be more eifective than free sulfur,
a recognized ' ide.

Entomologists and plant pathologists
investigated the fungicidal as well as
the insecticidal properties of this
group. One of the ﬁrst compounds test-
ed, sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate,
(CH3) 2N-C (S)SNa, even in dilutions
of 1:30,000, was found to be a powerful
fungicide, but somewhat injurious to
plant life.

This led to a systematic program of
research including other metallic salts,
the ethyl, propyl, butyl, phenyl, and
other aryl derivatives of the dithiocar-
bamates and thiuram mono- and di-
sulﬁdes, and the related compounds

Held testing oi promising fungicides, Including “Pm'xete" formulations, for controlot to

  

made from ethylenediamine and mor-
pholine. In this phase of the work, or-
ganic chemists played an important
role by suggesting various derivatives
and preparing them for tests. Later, in
cases where proper dispersion and ad-
herence of the compounds to plants were
important, the skill of physical chemists
was called upon.

In general, the compounds of greater
chemical stability were found to be less
eifective. Fungicidal eﬂiciency dimin-
ished with increase in size of alkyl radi-
cal, and as aryl radicals were substituted
for alkyl. Thus the unusual situation
developed that with the exception of
the bisethylene (dithiocarbamates) , the
ﬁrst and simplest products tested, the
methyl derivatives, proved to be the
best fungicides.

Iron and zinc dimethyldithiocarbam-

Overall, the derivatives of these
groups of compounds proved to be out-
standing as fungicides, rather than as
insecticides. Although a marked degree
of speciﬁcity for diiferent pests was
characteristic of the members of this
series, it is interesting to note that all
three were highly eﬁective. This work
oﬁ'ers still another example of how the
breadth of interest in a company like
Du Pont can lead to worthwhile de-

What are the opportunities
for research men?

Men qualiﬁed for fundamental or applied ro-
