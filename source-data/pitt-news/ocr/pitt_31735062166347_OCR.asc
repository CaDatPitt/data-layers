Increase in Faculty Insurance,
Retirement Benefits Revealed

Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld announceda major in-
crease in-faculty insurance, health, and retirement beneﬁts as
another step toward accomplishment of new goals in faculty

support and encouragement.

’ Coupled with the disclosure of the new program was the
announcement of a ﬁat ﬁve ‘per cent salary increase for mem-

bers of the University’s acad-emicO~

staff. Both developments were
announced at a general meeting of
the faculties and followed authori-
zation by the University Board of
Trustees.

It is estimated the University’s
added annual cost for the new
beneﬁts will be $155,000. The
over-all salary increase, plus in-
dividual merit raises to faculty
members who have demonstrated
outstanding professional attain-
ment and growth, will add ‘ap-
proximately $330,000 to Pitt’s an-
nual academic payroll.

Beneﬁts Overdue

“Such a program is long over-
due at Pitt,” Dr. Litchﬁeld said in
commenting on the announce-
ments. “If we expect to attract
and hold ﬁne academic minds, we
must offer them the kind of ﬁnan-
cial security and stability they
would ﬁnd in business or industry.
Our new program is another step
in this direction.”

The five percent salary in-
crease, effective July 1, 19.57,
will be the second across-the-;
board raise for Pitt faculty in
the past year and a half. A ten

»

 

 

percent increase for all faculty

members was granted Feb. 1,
t 1956.’

The new program of beneﬁts
substantially increases the retire-

phe medical insurance, and lifts
the present ceiling of $10,000. C
Three Provisions . .

The beneﬁts program includes
the following provisions: Retire-
ment beneﬁts: The University, as
do many other institutions, par-
ticipates in the Teachers Insur-
ance"and Annuity Association and
in the College Retirement Equities
Fund on a contract basis which
provides for faculty and profes-
sional administration ‘participation
in a retirement program.

Under the old plan at Pitt, fac-
ulty members paid in six percent
of their income up to $5,000 an-
nually and the University matched
this with an equal sum.

Under the new plan, the re-
tirement contribution will be
based on total salary without
limit. The contribution there-

Chevy is
Americas “hot”car

Chevrolet Wins Coveted
l\'Ianufacturers’ Trophy at
Daytona Beach as “best
/performing U. S. automobile”!

Want facts about performance?

Then look at the oﬁicial ﬁgures from,
NASCAR’s* internationally famous
Daytona Beach competition for stock
cars. Here’s what you'll ﬁnd: Chev-
rolet, in.two weeks of blistering com-
petition, proved itself as America’s
Number One performance car. Nothing
in the 1ow—price ﬁeld could touch it.

No » other car,

  

    
  
 

regardless of price,

scored such a sweep: And Chevy
walked away with the famous Manu-
facturers’ Trophy, hands down!

The 1957 Chevrolet is, by all odds,
the most astonishing performer ever‘
produced in the low-price ﬁeld. Best
of all, this superiority isn't limited to .
just a few extra-cost high-performance A
models. Every type of Chevy—from
the six-cylinder models right up to the
283—horsepower “Super Turbo—Fire"
V8’s, from the single—carburetor V8’s
with Powerglide to the stick—shift
“270’s”——is a championship car.

“It’s Your Student Government——Take Part In It.”
, These words can be found in many places around the

 University during the weeks before student elections. There

is more than information in those words . . . there’s a warn-
ing that bears close examinati_on. . _ _ _

Every student in this Universityas at some time di-
rectly affected by the rulings and deClSlOl’lS of the student
governing bodies. Under the present systems of govern-
ment at—large representation is broad-based and compre-
hensive. The views of most students are presented in the
thinking of the representatives. Things are due to change,

" however. 7‘

Proposals are under consideration, and~in the case of

'Men’s Council, have already been approved to limit at-large

representation and concentration on area representation.
This plan would provide a greater coverage than ever for
total rather than sample representation.

Because the plan limits at—large representation, how-
ever, more candidates will be running for the few positions
that are-open. On the other hand, more willbe seeking
appointments rather than election. This" is where the ‘ne-
cessity of running for office through the general election
is important. ‘

If a student feels qualiﬁed for ofﬁce it is his duty and’,
responsibility to seek the ofﬁce. The only way for him to

insure that his opinions are heard is to be present when the

opinions are presented.

Why elect someone else on his word that he agrees
with your viewpoint when you can guarantee representa-
tion of your views and those of yourpbackers. A It’s‘ good
common sense to run for office if you feel qualiﬁed.“ And
what student government «needs is ‘people with good com-

mon sense. ‘

Pocket R

By Barbara Cherington

Sam shut off the receiver on his two—way wrist
TV and jumped into a taxicopter at the corner of
Liberty and Stanwix . ,

He had two minutes to get to his economics
class. “Where to?” asked the ’copter driver.

“Pitt entrance through the Tech campus under-
ground hallwayl’?

In a minute the ’copter was
lifted above the down-town
buildings: Jonson’s Robot Fac-
tory, Kamble’s Pocket Rocket
Corporation, Axle’s Moving Side
Walk Company, Turner’s Season
Changer Corporation Building.

It was late afternoon and off
to the west, Sam could see the
moon. A sign reading “Eat. at
Joe’s” blinked on and off on
that white sphere.

Ride to Classroom

In another minute the ’copter set Sam down
at the Tech—Pitt entrance. He stepped out of the
’copter on to a ‘moving side walk, pushed a button
numbered 311, and was swished along the under-
grand hallway until the ﬂoor stopped in front of
311. ’

As Sam walked into the room a bell rang.
I-Iis professor was distributing blue books for the
Five questions ﬁlled the

 

board: A .

2. Explain the law of diminishing returns in

ape breed) decreased?

4. Explain the origin_and organization of the
Federal Mars Banking System. \

5. Compare our economy to that of Russia, us-
ing information you collected during the jet trip
we took to that country yesterday.

An hour later Sam left 311. He took a hori-
zontal escalator to the Schenley Hotel and then a
vertical escalator to the Pitt News office. He
thumbed through volumes of past newspapers.
Thumb thru Past ’

He traced back through the hydrogen and
atomic areas and their application to peacetime
living. He went back through the years of elec-
tric dominance, too. _

In each of these times, he found various organi-
zations of activity reported on and explained inthe
newspaper. In each _era, the clubs were typical of

their age. In each, the groups were different chang-

ing with the times. ,

Yet Sam found several threads of consistency
through the volumes of newspapers from the dis-
tant years of the 1930’s. This thread was the ex-
istence of human self-expression and government,
While all the outside forces changed, while planets
were tamed, and while robots were worked, human
expression sustained, directing the use of the
forces, the planets, and the work of the robots.

People want to lead, and to follow when they
are part of the deciding of what they are to ‘fol-
low. Each group needs various separate as well
as combined legislatures—-women, men, students,
and combinations of these. They want merely to
help decide how, why, when and where they are

to be restrained or freed. A -

A Stageful of Truth‘

By Lyn Stasenko

The obvious trend in today’s
theatre is unadulterated realism.

Ben Gazzara, starring in his
original role in “A Hatful of
Rain” now at the Nixon, is right
in swing with
the trend; for,
as he explains
it, “I like truth‘
in the theatre.
I enjoy roles
that are life

like — not the
clear-cut bad
guy or the
lily-white guy.
That’s just not
life. It’s more
of a mixture.” '

The 26-year-old actor believes-

the theatre is not for entertain-
ment alone. “It’s also for edu-
cation,” he says.
Tennessee Williams, one ‘of the
greatest playwrights of our time
because he writes of life -' the
way life is. His material is some-
times raw, but it’s _‘real. It’s

,Dean or Douglas . . .‘

 

“I consider‘

truth.”
Gazzara's Career

Gazzara’s career in the theatre
really started when he and sev-
eral other students at the Actor’s
Studio in New York decided to
dramatize a scene from the
novel, End As a Man, for a
classroom exercise. He played
the role of Jocko DeParis, a
Machaivellian, cadet in a south-
ern military college and was so
successful that the ‘‘exercise’_’
became an ofT—Broadway pro-
duction and ultimately a Broad-

. way hit play.

That was in 1953. Since then,
Gazzara has appeared in Tenn-
essee Williams’ “Cat On A_ Hot
Tin Roof” and Michael V. Gaz-
zo’s “A .Hatful of Rain.” He will
again be seen in his original role
of Jocko «when his ﬁrst motion
picture, “The Strange One,”
based on the novel, End As a

* Man, is released this spring.

Part of the Group

Asked what he enjoys most in
acting, Gazzara said, “I enjoy
acting in something I believe in.

Oscar   Outlook

. By Ed Bachman

(Editor’s Note: This is the sec-
ogid of two columns concerning
the Academy Awards.) ,

A week from tonight, the
bright spotlight will be turned
on Hollywood and New York,
and millions will watch the af-E
fair on television, as the annual
A c a d e m y ‘

Awards will be
presented. The

A w a r d s are
about the last
affair left in

Hollyw o o d ’ s
glamorous past
which remain
unaffected by
the changes of
time.

As~was point-
ed out in Mon-
day’s column,
been greatly responsible for the
major changes in Movieland. To
attempt to lick these changes,
the producers have entered a
period of high—cost, colossal
movies, with all stops pulled in
a frantic attempt to get the
American public back in the
theater.

Slight Favorite

Pictures such as “Around the
World in 80 Days,” the slight
favorite in the “best picture”

television has

 

category, were unheard of just
a few years ago. But this is not
the exception, but rather the
rule on current H o 1 1 y w o 0 d
schedules.

But interest remains high in
the “Oscar” presentations. Most
individuals would gladly give

, their right arm for the coveted

statuette. With such an award
in their possession, most stars
can command top roles and top
salaries in future productions.

The “Best actor” category
again presents an interesting
element as the late James Dean
for the second year in a row has
been nominated in an attempt to
win the ﬁrst posthumous award in
history. But Kirk Douglas, who
can be one of the best actors or
one of the biggest hams depend-
ing on how hard his director
sits on him, should win the
award.

Fabulous Year

If Kirk is overtaken in the
voting, look to Yul Brynner, the
man who has made many people
forget Pres1ey’s sideburns. Yul
had a fabulous year in 1956,
with “The King and I” (for
which he was nominated), “An-
astasia,” and “The Ten Com-

mandments” all in his wake.

And it’s wonderful to be’ in on
the creation of the whole pro-
duction. That’s one "of the rea-
sons why I accepted the role of
Jocko in “The Strange One.” I
felt I was a part of the group
who created it.”

Gazzara is not in the least bit
worried about becoming stereo-
typed in his acting. He says he
simply won’t let it happen.

Backing up his statement, he ex-V“ 

plained that he would like very
much to try his hand at different
types of roles —— from Shakes-
peare to modern comedy. “I may
even get a chance to do a music-
al someday,” he added. “I’m
taking singing lessons now.”

It is certainly refreshing to

see how this young star has car-

ried his desire for versatility in-
to his private life. In summing
up his interests, he admitted
that he likes all music —— classic
to jazz —- and his reading. con-
sists of everything from [Spil-
lane to Tolstoy. A lot of talent
-——and still an all-around av-
erage guy.

? Reams have been written on I
Ingrid Bergman and her come-.

back to American movies. Many
people suspect that the main

reason ‘for her nomination is »
based on the public’s interest in '.

Ingrid’s private life. But her no-
mination is highly justiﬁed. Her
portrayal of Anastasia was
vivid, emotion-packed.and sin-
cere, and if acting talents alone

are considered in the voting, she ‘

should walk off with the “best
actress” award.

It’ll be close, ’

,)'\.

if talent-ladden Deborah Kerr l.

gets long-deserved recognition.
As for the other awards, an
interesting race for the “best
supporting actor” should be
waged between two newcomers.
Don Murray (“Bus Stop”) and
A n t h o n y Perkins (“Friendly

Persuasion”) should stage a bat- c

tle royal for the ‘honor...But

» Perkins, one of the most re-

freshing new faues Hollywood
has unveiled in years, is the
slight pick by this corner.

An old trooper, Mercedes Mc-
Cambridge, impressed us most in
the “best supporting actress”
category, for her work in
“Giant,” but since she has al-
ready won the Oscar once, the

nod may go to Eileen’I-Ieckart.-—i

(“The Bad .Seed’’).

Miss Lily Agnes Solomon,
a foreign exchange student
from India has been at Pitt
since last September.

The fact that her father was
converted from his native

Hunduism to the Lutheran faith
with the next generation of his
family following him, led the" way
for the Lutheran Churches Wom-
en’s Association scholarship which
Miss Solomon received, to study
education in American colleges.

Thiel College at Greenville, Pa.
was where she studied for and re-
ceived her bachelor of science "de-
gree in education. Several colleges
and universities opened their
doorsto her for study towards her
masters degree in education, how-
ever, she ‘choose Pitt.

When asked why she choose
Pitt, Miss _Solomon stated, “The
architecture of the building im-
pressed me as being different
from any other institution of
learning which I have ever
seen.”

The University appeals to Miss

Solomon inWmany other ways.
However, it is the friendliness on
the part of the students and the
faculty who have made her feel
at home in all possible ways.

Miss Solomon is quite pleased
that,Pitt has elevators. She does
not seem to understand why the
students are so annoyed with
the pushing and shoving in
them. “Just the fact that Pitt
has elevators is wonderful. In
India we have no elevators and
must walk,” she commented.

Upon reading the Pitt News,
she commented upon an article

*stating that Pitt was a factory.

She said that it did not seem like
a factory to her; but it did seem
to be a center of education, be-

Coach Neiger Optimistic V I
About Panther Chances

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

The 1957 Panther gymnastics team will try to wind up
a successful season in a blaze of glory this weekend at the
NCAA Gymnastics championships at Annapolis, Md. In in-
vading the home base of Navy’s Middies, thePanthers will
be shooting for their first national individual title and a
high team ranking. y

Tom Darling, Eastern titlist on the ﬂying rings, will play the favor-
ite’s role in the nationals. “Darling has a good chance to take down

ﬁrst place,” forecasts Coach Warren Neiger. And a good chancie it is '

too, when one considers that Darling was runner-up on the ﬂying rings
in last year’s NCAA event at North Carolina, and the champ, Jack
Hoerner of Navy, has graduated. If Darling is successful, it will ‘mark
the Blue and Go1d’s first individual title in three years of competition.

“The rings and tumbling will be our strongest events, as they
were in the Easterns”,,Neiger says. In addition to the No. 1 man, the
Jungle Cats boast two strong performers in Jack Hammond and
Dave Hirst. These two ﬁnished right behind Darling in the Eastern
League classic and can bring more team points home for the locals.
Incidentally, Hammond ﬁnished ﬁfth in last year’s nationals.

In tumbling, Neiger will go again with the “H-boys”——Hammond
and Hirst. The pair garnered third andufourth places in the sectional
championships. Sophomore Don Neeld will also go in the tumbling and
a good night for the husky jumping-jack could bring him into‘ the
scoring column.‘ “

Dave Ruber, well—known Jungle Cat rope climber, will be going
after national recognition. A steady “four-seconds-ﬂat” performer who
finished fourth at Syracuse in the Easterns; Ruber is counted on to
furnish more valuable points. *3’

Ruber, a senior, was just named permanent captain for this

year’s squad. Neiger commented, “He’s a specialty artist, but his ‘

work this year has given us quite a boost.” John -Cacolice, an-
other swift rope man, has a good chance also to score. '

- Versatile Jim Mulvihill will go for the Panthers on the horizontal

bar. Mulvihill’s work has been a consistent scorer and a tough disqual-

iﬁcation lost him a place in the Easterns. He may come through in
this big one, though.

The coach is looking for a high team ranking for his boys. “We
tied for tenth last year with only two boys (Darling and Hammond)
competing,” recalled Neiger, “but with seven strong performers going,
I think we’ll do better on Saturday.” Best guesses will place Pitt as
high as ﬁfth. The NCAA tourney calls for ten scoring places with 11
points for ﬁrst, 9 for second, 8 for third, and so on. All acrobats plac-
ing in Saturday’s ﬁnals are assured of team points. 3

Big Ten king-pin Illinois will be back to defend its national title
°against 40 rivals, and probably will be favored to win again. Penn
State’s Nitt-any ions and the Florida State ’Gators however, will put
up a strong argument. Georgia Tech’s gymnasts who visited here
earlier in the season had awed admiration for the Florida squad.

“They tromped us good and will win at Annapolis,” one Engineer '

predicted in true Southern fashion. It should be a good match how-
ever, especially with Penn State’s Armando Vega and Phil Mullen
back to defend individual titles.

Vega may take down two firsts this year. In addition to keeping his
parallel bars trophy, he is in a good spot to win the all-round event.

.Mason-Enlivens Squash Future

, Frosh Sensation

.the Panther

Tagged ‘Best’ By
Coach Jim Tully ,
By MURRAY ‘CI-[ASS
In a city where squash is
trying valiantly to break into
the athletic limelight, Pitt’s
Dave Mason is one of the more

talented leaders.

Mason is only a Panther

freshman who hasinot sampled
college varsity competition, but
in his relatively shortterm of ﬁve
years of experience in outside
play this racqueteer has display-
ed enough- ability to assure him-
self of a place on next year’s
squash squad.
In fact, according to Coach
Jim Tully, Mason will probably

. shoot right to the head of the

nine-man team. “He’ll be the
’No. 1 man next year,”/Tully
proclaims. 3 _

This future headliner, who in
his sophomore year should be
to the Panther squashers .what
sophomore sensation Don Hennon
was to the hoopsters this past
season, is also considered by Tully
to be “by far the best of the Pitt
boys I have coached.”

Mason played freshman squash
this season and was the lone win-

pner when the Blue and Gold year-

lings met the Navy Frosh, their
only contest. This match points
out the one drawback to next
year’s squash team.
‘No matter how outstanding
. Mason is, he can wm_ just one
set and not ﬁve, which is the re-
quired winning number.

A mechanical engineering stu-
dent, Mason is currently prepar-
ing for the National Junior Cham-
pionships, scheduled for 'Pitts-

foot frame is topped off by a

blond 1 crew—cut, captures this
title, he will add‘ a much-cherish-
ed trophy to his already overflow-
ing award case. ,

Although he is actually classed
in the junior squash section,
Mason has won singles champion-
ships in both the Pittsburgh Class
C and Class B divisions. These
titles came in 1954 and 1956, re-
spectively. e

Ranked number one in the
city’s junior division (players
under 19), he has taken almost
every title within range. In 1955
and 1956 he received trophies
for the City, Edgeworth Club,
PAA, and Pittsburgh Golf Club
Junior championships.

He won the O’Laughlin Mem-
orial tournament in 1956, but
found it difficult to defend this
year because he was-in New York
at the time playing on a senior
team from Pittsburgh against a
New York squad.

The outcome was the usual,

Last Saturday the locals closed
their regular season with a 1408

By winning all these titles,
Mason is merely upholding a
family tradition. His dad,

one of the top players among

Back to the current Pitt Mason,
Tully believes that before long
this freshman will be one of the
best players in Pittsburgh. “He’s

coming along fast and he’ll con-

tinue to improve,” the Panther
coach states. “He’s a hard hitter.
What he needs most is good com-
petition.”

Tully explains that Pittsburgh
does not provide the type ‘bf play
that, for instance, Philadelphia
does.

Oh, yes. Dave Mason plays a
little tennis, too. He took care
of the City High School doubles
title in 1955 and the singles
crown the next year while play-
ing for the Green and White at

' Allderdice High.

Last year he traveled to New
York as a member of a junior

tale —- Mason won, his team lost.

story will be retold for the next

Although Spring doesn’t officially start until tomorrow,
Coach John Michelosen jumped the gun andhad his grid-

The hardest. hit slots are at
quarterback and end. Here the
Oaklanders loose Joe Walton, All-
American who established a school
record by catching 14 touchdown
passes in two years, and rugged
Bob Rosborough.

Dale Brown and Bob Kiesel,
two reserve ends, will also be
missing, leaving Dick Scherer as
the only returning letterman at
this position. a

At quarterback, the Panthers lost
two veterans in Corny Salvaterra
and Darrell Lewis. Salvaterra and
Lewis shared all the duties "last
season, thereby limiting both Bill
Kaliden and Jim Lenhart to spot
appearances.

Three more linemen will be
missing in Herman Canil, Bob
Pollock, regular tackles for two
years, and guard Vince Scorsone.

The rest of the graduating
seniors represent the backfield.
Corky Cost, Bugs Bagamery,
Nick Passodelis, and Ray Di Pas-

tions while Tom Jenkins and
Ralph Jelic leave a big hole at
fullback. .

In the next 20 days, Coach
Michelosen and his staff will have
to draw some good‘ conclusions as
to who will ﬁll these vacancies
next September when they open
up against the No. 1 team in the
nation-—Oklahoma.

In an interview the head coach

Over 60 candidates were invited
to the ﬁrst dayof ‘practice. under
the leadership of Jim McCusker
and Chuck Brueckman. McCusker

captains at a player's meeting held

WORLD OF TOMORROW
CURTISS-WRIGHT...I.eadership today and tomorrow

,If your objective is to put your best into engineering, and get the most from engineering, you belong
with an organization like Curtiss-Wright where engineering is the foundation of all activities. Curtiss-
Wright offers stability, born of its international leadership in aviation, and of its diversiﬁcation into
other major ﬁelds of engineering. Curtiss-Wright’s world-wide program for the future is one of action
. . . action in -which you, as an engineer, can make the most of your abilities. The scope of Curtiss-
Wright’s engineering and development program permits you to choose the ﬁeld most interesting to
you--i'n one of the company’s 17 Divisions—-in one of the facilities located in more than a dozen cities
in several states. The diversiﬁcation of the company’s products and activities gives you not only a
choice of engineering interest but also assures you of a future stability, because of the continued
growth of the company’s commercial products as well as defense products. Your future at Curtiss-
Wright rests securely upon the steady growth of a constantly expanding national economy.

TAKE YOUR CHOICE -THE FIELD IS W|DE—Here are some of the products and projects from among
which you may choose the ﬁeld most interesting to youiand where you can best utilize your talents:
aircraft engines, including Turbo-Compound, turboprop, jet, ramjet and rockets; subsonic and
transonic propellers; ﬂight simulators, nuclear power systems, test equipment and industrial instru-
mentation and control systems; jet engine controls and thrust reversers; development of new concepts
in propulsion systems for aircraft, helicopters, missiles, drones, and non-military uses; research,
design, and testing of advanced weapons systems; development and production of missiles; research
in aerodynamics, thermodynamics, metallurgy, chemistry, structures, nuclear energy, ultrasonics,’
electronics, plastics; development and manufacture of diesel engine governors and precisionspring
clutches; and the manufacture of diesel and gas turbine engines and military vehicles. There is a place
for you, in one of these many activities. Since each division is an operating entity, you work in smaller
groups. But, since Curtiss-Wright is a large organization you gain all the advantages which only a
company like this can offer you—-insurance, retirement, assistance for advanced study, management
development program——all of the beneﬁts that will make your association with the company proﬁtable
and satisfying to you.

FACILITIES --To encompass such a rapidly growing program, Curtiss-Wright is constantly adding to
its facilities. On an 80 square mile tract in Quehanna, Pa., a new Research and Development Center
is being built. Several of the buildings are already erected, while others are in process of construction
and still more are being designed especially to house personnel and equipment which will be re-
quired for special projects. In other parts of the country also new facilities are being added to our
modern, country-wide engineering plant. Look in any direction and you will see evidence of the
planned growth of Curtiss-Wright Corporation. This is continuing Curtiss-Wright’s leadership today
and assuring it for tomorrow. Here is work for engineers who want a real future, offering opportunity
as great as your desire to excel. I
