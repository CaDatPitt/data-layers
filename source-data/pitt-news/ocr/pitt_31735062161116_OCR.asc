UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Scot Ross

 Managing Editor

During last night’s dialogue between
talklshow host Phil Donahue and Soviet
-mmentator Vladimir Pozner, Donahue
. counted his historic broadcast on Russian
television where he and a Seattle audience
were linked with a Pozner-moderated
Leningrad audience to discuss U.S.-Soviet
relations.

In the course of the 1987 event, Donahue,
like a self-described Rambo, fired such
questions as, What about the KGB? What
about Sakharov? What about the refuseniks?
What about free speech? What about
human rights? What about Afghanistan?

'Uncle Sam ’
attends
conference

Asst. News Editor

A man dressed in a red, white
and blue suit and calling himself
“Uncle Sam” was the last member
of the audience to address
Vladimir Pozner, Phil Donahue

ind the rest of the audience

hours of questions and answers
last night at the Syria Mosque.

“I want to welcome you, Mr.
Pozner, for the rest of the people
in this country who are not here
tonight,” the man said.

He went on to say that there
were two “Uncle Sams. ” Himself,
whom he said truly represented

 the American people, and the
I‘ Uncle Sam appearing on U.S.
military posters.

“This Uncle Sam isn't No. 1
and doesn’t want to be No. 1,”
he said. “I speak for the nation ,
when I say that we want to find
out [who] is going around and

What about Siberia and all those prisons?
After this tirade, classified by Donahue
as “what may have been as angry and
aggressive an oration that I have ever
delivered,” Donahue discovered that every
word he spoke was in fact transmitted to
the television sets of the Soviet Union.

He deduced from this and other
circumstances that Soviet citizens “are
more curious about Americans than we
are about them.”

Throughout the course of last night’s
moderately-attended program; however,
the Syria Mosque audience seemed more
Curious about the Soviets, despite the
large number of Soviet representatives in
attendance.

Donahue hosts dialogue with Soviet journalist

It was Pozner who more often than not
was questioned by the audience. Donahue
was also addressed, but much of the
discussion involved Americans pondering
policies with Pozner.

The audience questioned Pozner about
such topics as the economy of the Soviet
Union, also asking if the world can expect
more from perestroika and how the Balkan
states fit into the Soviet governments
plan.

Pozner answered the questions
confidently, taking time to draw laughter
at the expense of Vice President Dan
Quayle when he asked what would happen
if President George Bush were gone.

At several points in the discussion, the

talk shifted back to the opening oftelevision
lines between the-superpowers. Donahue,
who was the first American host to tape a
show behind the Iron Curtain, was praised
by Pozner for his work in breaking down
the barriers between the United States and
the Soviet Union. ‘

“IS-le’s come t() be one of  Pozner

Donahue credited Po’/.ner’s commitment
to world unity in part to his traveling as a
youth. Pozner was born in Paris and
moved to New York City, where he stayed
until he was sixteen. At this time, his
family moved to East Germany and finally
to Moscow, where he has remained.

The Chautauqua at Pitt conference
formally got under way yesterday with a
plenary session on the current state of
U.S.-Soviet relations.

After a few introductory announcements
by Daniel L. Bratton, president of the
Chautauqua Institution, Hendrick Smith,
the U.S. moderator for the seminar,
introduced Curtis W. Kamman, deputy
assistant to the Secretary of State.

Kamman directed many of his comments
toward the objectives of U.S. relations
with the Soviets. “Our objective is building
a long—term I foundation for future
relations,” he said. ,

Kamman sees “new « ipportunities  for
progress in arms cor .rol.” He said that
both sides must worry . bout their security,

openness and transparency" in arms control
talks. He said there is a “paramount fear
surrounding security" in both countries, and
therein lies the mistrust.

He mentioned ecology as an example of
cooperation between the two countries. “We
are getting out of our old thinking about the
atmosphere,” he said. “We are expanding
our cooperation on ecology.”

Kamman believes that the two countries
are becoming more trusting of each other.
“We are not adversaries, but cooperative
partners,” he said. “For the first time, the
United States has a stake in changes under
way in the Soviet Union.”

After Kamman’s speech, Vladimir Pozner,
the Soviet moderator, introduced the Soviet
speaker, Vladimir F. Petrovskii, deputy
minister of foreign affairs.

Petrovskii echoed many of Kamman’s
remarks. “The shortest path to success  is
through Soviet and American cooperation,"

“Sweeping changes are taking the world
into a post-confrontational era,” Petrovskii
said to the crowd of about 1,000. “This new
political thinking is blazing a trail into the
future.”

Petrovskii also spoke about perestroika,
his country’s new economic reform. “Radical
changes are under way in the Soviet Union,”
he said. “The conditions are being created
to make our economy comparable to the
rest of the world.”

On the subject of arms control, Petrovskii
agreed with Kamman. “We should develop
a concept of verifiable, transparent
deterrence,” he said.

When Petrovskii finished, the audience
asked the speakers questions. Many
criticized the United States, especially on
the subject of Central America. When asked
if the United States was being hypocritical

U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation stressed for space exploration

By Milt Klopfer
Staff Writer

. Recalling past cooperation ,
representatives of the world’s two leading
national space programs looked toward
future joint missions last night in the Syria
Mosque Auditorium.

Former NASA administrator and Pitt
Distinguished Public Service Professor
James Fletcher, along with Deputy Director
of the USA and Canadian Institute’s
Academy of Science, Sergie Plexhanov,
moderated a program featuring scientists
and administrators involved with the Soviet
and American space programs.

“There's no way that we can sell the
space program [to our nations] with the
Cold War maxim ‘Who's on first?” said
Plexhanov, referring to the spirit of

competitiveness that existed between the
two countries during the S05 and 60’s.
American-Soviet space cooperation
dates from 1972 with a summit agreement
that led to 197S’s historic Apollo-Soyuz
space mission, when the two nations’
spacecrafts linked together while orbiting

the Earth.

“The historical significance of the
Apollo—Soyuz mission was that it
symbolized the improvement of US—Soviet
relations [since the 60’s],” said Konstantin
V. Frolov, vice president of the USSR
Academy of Sciences. “It had a great
political impact,” he said.

In addition to its symbolic value, the
effort proved that both countries could
overcome the technical obstacles involved

’ in linking not only two spaceships, but

also two space programs.

  Conference ecl9oesKl9msl9cl9ev
visit three decades earlier

By Erik Kridle
Asst. News Editor

This week's Chautauqua at Pitt
conference is not the first time that
important officials from the Soviet Union
have visited the University of Pittsburgh.

.. On Sept. 24, 1959, Soviet Premier Nikita

VS. Khrushchev stopped at Pittfor a luncheon‘
‘ at the Student Union Ballroom. Khrushchev

spent the last twoidays of his 10-day tour

of the United States in Pittsburgh, touring

. the Mon Valley and addressing 500 people

at the Pitt luncheon, as well as millions of
others around the world via television.

Pitt Chancellor Litchfield authorized the

‘ setup of a dozen closed—circuit television

0

screens throughout campus, allowing Pitt
students to view Khrushchev’s speech at
1:30 p.m. All Pitt classes between 1:30
p.m. and.3:00 p.m. were canceled at the
order of Chancellor Litchfield.

When the Soviet Premier’s visit at Pitt

was over and his speech delivered,»

Chancellor Litchfield was bothioptimistic
and pessimistic about theresults of the
visit. ,

“It didn’t do anything to help him
understand the United States any better,"
Litchfield said. However, he added that

the visit “probably left him with a warmer
feeling about the American «people than .

before.” ,
Litchfield also said, “The students will
realize now that the University of Pittsburgh
is part of a much larger community. ‘
“It will make them feel we have some
reason to be proud. We were able to bring
Chairman Khrushchev‘ here,” he said.

By Kathie Roth
Staff Writer '

U.S. and Soviet economic specialists
held a workshop yesterday afternoon in

_which they addressed the changing

conditions of U.S.—Soviet trade and
discussed possibilities for increasing further

‘international investment.

Speakers representing the Soviet Union
included noted economist Rostislav
Konyaev and Valery I. Rybin, senior
researcher at the Institute of Economics
and the Academy of Sciences.

American spokesmen werejames Giffen,
president of Mercator Corporation and
Qrmer president of the U..S.-U.S.S.R. Trade
and Economic Council, and H. Michael
Mears, consultant in finance a_nd trade.

Two major topics which they discussed

Litchf1eld’s wife, who sat next to the
premier at the luncheon, later told reporters
that Khrushchev commented to her about
the many photographers he encountered
here at Pitt. ;

She asked Khrushchev if the “Russians
had a word like ‘cheese.”’ ,

“He said they didn’t, ” she recalled, “lbutl
he wouldlike to learn the word.

“After that, he kept on saying the word
‘cheese’ to all the photographers,” she
said.

Relations —-

Continued from page 1
by denouncing the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan while supporting uprisings
by the Contras, Kamman said that both
countries must cooperate to solve both

1 problems.

Kamman went on to describe President
Bush’s “open lands and open skies”
programs. He said that both NATO and
Warsaw Pact countries should allow
foreigners into areas that are currently off-
limits, both on the ground and in the air.
Under this program, small unarmed planes
would be allowed to ﬂy over both countries
for arms control verification. ,

Petrovskii was not free from the criticism.
Although he received general applause
for most of his answers, he was met with
silence when he responded to questions
about his country’s policies toward the
Baltic States. He said that there is a “general
understanding of integration in the Baltic
States.”

‘Possibilities for trade between supe

were joint ventures and investment
partnerships. There are approximately only
1,000 joint ventures existing in the Soviet
Union, according to Konyaev. He said,
“American business is not making sufficient
use of the opportunities at this time.”
Mears was enthusiastic about the
possibilities for expansion. He said, “I am
more optimistic today than I have been

any time.”

He then advised the audience to
remember that “any bold new addition is
going to have small failures. 1 don’t know
how they will be handled by the Soviet
and Western presses. .Let’s keep an eye on
our successes.” e

Rybin also spoke of the importance of
increasing the economic activity between
the two nations. He said that this would
“require not only great ideas but

Rockwell International president
Georgejeffs, who headed his corporation’s
development of the American side of the
mission explained the problem.

“Space is not easy. It’s very dangerous.
It’s risky and expensive,” he said. “It’s
tough to work together. Every error you
make shows up in a [massive] way.”

For the mission, 23 Soviet and American
surface-based tracking stations jointly
monitored the two spacecrafts. Design

teams from both countries collaborated

extensively in developing the universal
docking module and a system of navigation
procedures to connect the spacecrafts.

However, space cooperation is blocked
by obstacles other than technical problems,
according to Sam W. Keller, associate
deputy administrator of NASA.

“In both countries, space and national ’

security are closely intertwined. This has
slowed the process of cooperation,” said
Keller. “In developing a relationship [the
American and Soviets] have taken very
small and very measured first steps,” he
said.

Those steps have led to the 1987
agreement between NASA and the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, which assigned five
groups of Soviet and American scientists
to investigate topics such as environmental
research and space medicine.

According to Jeffs and Frolov, future
Soviet-American space cooperation is
essential. While no formal plans have
been made, both men believe that a future
manned mission to Mars will only be
possible if the two countries are working
together.

investment.

“Initial investment and joint ventures
require many internal and external
conditions. We understand that the solution
of the problems depends on cooperation.”

Giffen agreed that the current level of
Soviet foreign trade is not at its highest
possible level. He emphasized two

conditions which he felt were important

to improving trade relations. “There must
be a continued improvement of political
attitudes. There must be a freedom from
[business] constraints."

All of the speakers, however, agreed
that the great barrier between the two
economies existed due to the inability to
exchange rubles and dollars. It is a problem
resulting in a grave difficulty for businesses
who are attempting to sell their goods in
the Soviet market, according to Mears.

rpowers explored

He said, "[Converting the rublelsis an
extremely complex and difficult thing to

 do. Price reform is one of the first steps

toward convertibility. Secondly, the Soviet
Union has to be producing many more
world class goods.”

Rybin claimed that the problems in
developing an exchange rate stem from
the lack of agreement on the market value.

Konyaev expanded this claim saying,
“We are of differing viewpoints. The official
policy as I am aware of it is as follows: we
look for [an exchange rate] no earlier than
2005. We do feel that it is possible to make
the ruble convertible to other socialist
countries.”

He concluded by saying that “one can
begin to carry out a partial convertibility
and should.”

Problems plague the trial board system as it stands V

"'3 A police oﬂicer can beat the

hell out ofa Pittstudentand there
is not recourse.

—Mayor Sophie Masloff

Police officers in the city of
Pittsburgh can presently take
outrageous liberties when they
do their jobs. - .

The Pittsburgh police trial’

board system essentially allows
members of the police department
to do things and commit crimes
for which the police and the
judicial system would reprimand
average citizens. As a result of the
problems with the corrupted trial
board system, police officers can

(get away with things that they

have absolutely no right to do.
On Friday, Feb. 11, 1989, I
had an encounter with a few
members of the Pittsburgh police.
I was arrested for driving while
under the influence (DUI), and I
have had to pay for it. However,
there is no excuse for the terrible
treatment I received from the
police officers, and, most
importantly, there is no way they
should be able to get away with
it. I was harassed and abused by

gteveral police officers. The

arresting officer was obscenely
vulgar and insulting.

Once I was pulled over, I got
out of my car and asked the
officer, a white female, if there
was a problem. The officer
responded by abruptly placing
her hand on her still-holstered
gun and saying, “Get back in the
car before I blow your f—king
head off.”

A series of visits to various
police stations around the city
followed while I was handcuffed
in the back of a paddywagon. I
really don’t know why this
happened. I imagine that the
purpose was to make me nervous
and to continue to mistreat me.
‘Hie whole affair was not only
long and tedious, but it was also
an unpleasant and terrible

experience. In abrief summary, H

I suffered utterly poor treatment
that no one should have to
undergo by police officers —
and particularly by the arresting

officer. She called me a great"

number of things, ranging from
sexual and intellectual insults to
ethnic and religious slurs.

“So you are a f—king Jew
bastard from Fox Chapel,” was
one of the many insulting
statements made by the arresting
officer. Another one was, “You
better check for AIDS, too —— he
looks the type.” Both statements
were made when I was at Mercy
Hospital having a blood test
taken. The officer seemed to
justify her behavior by saying,

 “You are so drunk that you will

not remember this in the
morning.” '

After the whole affair, I filed

a complaint with the Office of
Professional Responsibility of the
police department, following
appropriate procedures for filing
a complaint against an officer.

That was in early June. It is now
late October, and I have not even
received a letter acknowledging
my complaint. Having called the
office to inquire about my case
on a couple of occasions, the
person to whom my case was
assigned called me recently to
say she was about to start on it.

She also said that the final
outcome might not take place for
up to four months. In addition, it
will reach the level of the trial

board only if the investigation of
my case shows reasonable cause

for a meeting before the trial

board. Mayor Masloff said that

this lengthy process is another

example of the ineffectiveness of
the trial board system.

My encounter with the police
force was not long before the
Pittsburgh Grateful Dead concert
and the scandals that came out of
that event. As many people,
especially those from Pittsburgh,
probably know, on the night of

the Grateful Dead concert in
Pittsburgh, two officers lwere
filmed by KDKA—TV2 using
excessive force while arresting
two Grateful Dead fans who were
attempting to force their way
into the Civic Arena to\’ see the
concert for free. The film shows
evidence of -excessive force that
I don’t think anyone would
question or deny. _
However, the police trial
boards in both cases found the
officersnot guilty of their alleged
misconducts. Both cases were
absolute outrages and grave
travesties. It was these events

How DOYOU LiKe MY
Hat LOWeeN COSWM9»
GUYS? I'M some as

We FKesii>eNT!

 

that caused the city to begin to I

question and step up lobbying
efforts against its trial board
system more vehemently than in
the past. Of course, this led the
city 'to consider replacing its
system with a new system that
would prove more just and
unbiased than the present one.
The trial board system is one
of the only systems of its kind in
Pennsylvania and even in
America. One would think that
as a law enforcement agency,
the police department, and any

, police department for that matter,

should be expected to be made
up of clean, responsible,
respectable and upstanding
people. The police should be a
body made up of role models for
the rest of the community.
Instead, some police officers are
sloppy, incredibly foul—mouthed,
disrespectful and unaccountable
for their actions. If a police officer
does something that would be
considered a crime if done by a
normal citizen, he is brought
before the trial board and often

found not guilty of the act in
question. If that is not corruption,
I do not know what is.

About three monthslago, a
Pittsburgh police officer was
charged with driving under the
inﬂuence and leaving the scene
of an accident. If an average
citizen with no history of drinking
and driving is arrested for such
crimes, his punishment is possibly
a suspension of his license for
one year, $1,000 in fines, two
years probation, a criminal
conviction, a permanent criminal
record and two months in jail. If
a police officer commits those
crimes, he goesbefore the trial

board and is acquitted. It seems

very ironic that a police officer
can commit these crimes and
escape punishment and I cannot.
The officer in question has not
yet gone before the trial board,
but if the past record is any
indication, one would ex pectlhim
to be found not guilty. More
often than not, the fellow officers
on the trial board find the charged
officer not guilty of the alleged
crimes. If a citizen is held
responsible and accountable for
his actions, a police officer should
be held equally responsible for
his wrongdoings.

It should be noted that a few
officers have been fined by the
trial board, but most of them
were female or black. Mayor
Masloff has confirmed this. She
also said that this was a very
unfortunate fact about the system.
The members of Pittsburgh City
Council have suggested that the
city needs a new trial board
system. The one proposed by
Masloff is a better system -
however, it is not good enough.
If anyone commits a crime,
whether he is an average citizen
or a police officer or not, then he
should be tried in accordance
with the law for that crime. There
should be no trial boards, no
bonuses, no deals and no breaks
for police officers. I was arrested

 
  

. UHHH. . .
FRiGH‘leNiNG.

ITS ..

,in those words

     

for DUI and I have to pay the
punishment for that crime. If the
officer who is charged with both
DUI and leaving the scene of an
accident is found not guilty by_
the trial board instead of being
given a more serious punishment
than I was given, then terms such
as equality, law, justice and
criminal punishment will need to
be redefined for those of us who
believe, or rather used to believe,
and their
meanings. _

Certainly ifl said some of the
things to‘ an officer that the
arresting officer said to me, then
I would find myself in a great
deal of trouble. Ilowever, the
officer will probably not be
reprimanded in any way. That is,
when and if my complaint is
finally investigated by the police
department, they may decide that
it is not even important enough
to be brought before the trial
board.

A couple of months ago, a
friend of mine who moved to
Maryland from Pittsburgh over
the summer said, “Washington,
DC. has one of the most corrupt
police departments in the cou ntry.
There have been a lot of
indictments in the past year.”

My response to his statement
was, “No, Pittsburgh has one of
the most corrupt police
departments in America. There
have not been many successful
cases, guilty verdicts, or
indictments in the past year.”

Notre Dae's

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Despite Notre Dame being
the N o. 1-ranked college football
team in the nation, their defense
has been the subject of recent
criticism.

Common objections ‘are:
“They can stop the run, but their
pass defense is terrible,” and “I
don’t know how they keep
winning, with such a lousy

. secondary.”

Before Pitt came to town, the
Irish had allowed 1,485 yards
passing, compared to just 878 of
their own. The previous
Saturday, USC’s Todd
Marinovich threw for 335 yards
on 33 completions against this
“suspect” defense.

Where was this defense last
Saturday? The Fighting Irish
defense was the major reason
the previously seventh—ranked
Pitt Panthers lost by 42 points.

“Defensively, I think we did
the best job of the year,” said
Irish defensive tackle Jeff Alm.
“You have to give credit to our
defensive back and our outside
linebackers. They came up with
some great interceptions.”

Notre I)ame’s secondary
intercepted three of Alex Van
Pelt’s passes, holding him to
170 yards passing. Pat Terrell’s
late second-quarter, 5.4-yard
interception return for a
-touchdown put the Panthers
behind by more than one score

   
    

for the first time in the game, 17-
7. D’Juan Francisco returned his
third-quarter interception .41
yards, which set up yet another
Irish touchdown. Todd Lyght
intercepted Van Pelt’s last throw
of the game.

What makes - the three
interceptions , even more
impressive is that Van Pelt rarely
threw the ball down field into the
secondary. Most of Van Pelt’s
completions were , 5-10 yard
passes to tight end Lionel Sykes
or fullback Ronald Redmon. In

The Lady Panther volleyball
team picked up a couple of
wins over the weekend while
losing only once to 12th-ranked
Texas—Arlington in the USAir
Pitt Classic. Pitt blanked both
Syracuse and Arizona State, 3-
0, before falling to Arlington in
four close games.

“It was a competitive match,”
commented Pitt Coach -Sue
Woodstra about Arlington. “We
came out and beat them in the
first game and then lost a close
game that went back and forth.
It was a tough match.”

The Panthers matched up
well with Arlington, a team
which, according to Woodstra,
plays similarly to Pitt. In the
first game, Pitt handled the
tough Lady Maverick team but
then lost a game that was tied
at 14 and then at 15 before the
Panthers finally fell, 15-17.
From there on it was all

two games by scores of 15-5

“They play the same style as
us. They just had a little more
power, a little more lheightl,
really good ball control and
their defense was just great,”
said Woodstra of her team’s
opponents.

Pitt did receive recognition
forits play in the tournament.
Junior Michele Adamson and
senior Lori Silk were named to
the all—tournament team for
their performances. They both
were in agreement that the
team had a good tournament,
and neither one expected to
be selected.

“I thought I had a good
tournament, but I didn’t expect
to be picked for a tournament
team. I’m not one of the most
flashy players on the team, but
it's nice to be recognized,”
said Silk.

Adamson was surprised as
well. “I thought I played well
enough in the first two games,
at least offensively. But there

Just a few notes left over from
the weekend in sports. ‘

-The World Series is finally
over, and the Oakland Athletics’
dominance of the San Francisco
Giants can be summed up in

‘two facts. One, the total margin

of victory for the four games was
18 (52-14), the most for any
Series sweep ever. Second, the
A's set or tied 15 individual and
team World Series records this
year; the Giants had none.
-Speaking of the A's, when
Dave Stewart won the Series
MVP, he finally shed some of his
image as the best second—best
pitcher in baseball. For the past
three years, Stewart has been
the only pitcher in baseball to

win 20 or more games but will ~

probably finish second in the Cy
Young Award voting for the third
year in a row, this year behind
the Royals’ Bret Saberhagen.
-If Pittsburgh is ever going to
get an NBA franchise, they’re
going to have to draw better
than 10,346 for a Cleveland
Cavalier-New York Knick game.

Pelt’s face, forcing him to throw
early, or adding pressure from
behind, causing him to be timid
about staying in the pocket too
long. Alm was a little surprised at

the success of Notre Dame’s

defensive line.

“Pitt has a tough loffensivel

games as a guide to award
franchises, Pittsburgh would fall
somewhere between Portland,
Maine and Corvallis, Ore., in
getting a team. The fact that the
game fell on the same weekend
as the Pitt—Notre Dame game
should be discounted because
there will always be days that Pitt
would have basketball or football

games, or the Steelers would
play, or the Penguins would be
on television, or any number of
other events also would be going
on in the city. _

With Pitt down .17-7 at halftime,
there was no secret that the
Panthers would have to throw the
ball in order to get something
going. Knowing this, the Notre
Dame defensive line rose to the
occasion. On Pitt’s first possession
of the third quarter, Kowalkowski ‘
hit Van Pelt causing him to fumble.

falling, 105-97, to the Knicks.
After trailing by nine at the end of
the first quarter, the Cavs
outscored the Knicks 61-54 over
the next 24 minutes to cut the gap
to two entering the final period.
However, the Knicks put together
a 20-16 fourth quarter for the six-
point victory margin.

The Cavs were led by two
unlikely sources:- second-year
forwards Winston Bennett and
Randolph Keys. Bennett, from
Kentucky, gave Wilkens a strong
effort, scoring 13 and pulling
down seven rebounds. But it was

.. Keys who stole the show. The 6-

foot—7—inch gunner from Southern
Mississippi, who may have won
the starting small forward spot

for the Cavs’ opener in Chicago
Friday night, finished with a
game—high 25 points, seven
rebounds and four assists.

“I think I played pretty well
offensively,” Keys said, smiling.
“I know I can help this team until
the regulars get back.”

Knicks coach Stujackson stuck
with his regulars for most of the
game, playing only his top nine
players. Unlike Wilkens who
substituted freely, Jackson was
set on priming his regulars for

The Pitt men’s swimming
team won its first meet of the
year on Saturday with a score
of 167-31 over Duquesne at
Trees Pool.

Coach Dick Bradshaw said
Duquesne does not have the
talent to compete on Pitt’s
level. He said Saturday’s meet
was more of a tuneup to
begin the season, as the
Panthers won every event.

“We knew we would win.

.We were basically concerned
with personal times,” said
Bradshaw; D

Some key
swimmers were able to
achieve impressive times,

. Alm batted down Van Pelt’s first
pass and then hit Van Pelt hard
shortly after his next attempt.

“I just saw the gap, and all
week we talked about passing
lanes, and I just got one of my
mits up there to knock it down,”
Alm said of the batted pass.

Alm’s dominance continued
into the Panthers’ next possession.
Although he failed to record a
sack and only had two total tackles
in the game, he broke up three
passes and hit Van Pelt after just
about every second-half pass
attempt.

“I realized we were ahead, and
it would probably be my last
chance to get a sack in the game,”
said Alm of his dominating fourth
quarter.

It’s tough being No. 1, and
everyone looks for flaws in the
No. 1 team. Maybe after holding
the Pitt offense (which previously
averaged 31 points per game) to
seven points, the Notre Dame
defense will beigiven a deserved
break from criticism.

we had a solid focus. We set
small goals such as getting one
point at a time. We didn’t think
too far ahead. I thoug \ we had a
pretty good shot at be ing them
(Arlington), but we needed to do
the little things, and we weren’t
doing them (against Ar1ington),”
commented Adamson about the
tournament.

Tomorrow the Panthers will
travel to Youngstown for a tri-
meet with Youngstown and
Akron.

break into the top 10 in the
AFC in rushing, despite only
playing in three games.

-Mike Tomczak should be
through as the Chicago Bears
starting quarterback. Tomczak
was booed heartily while
completing only four of 16 passes
for 29 yards before being relieved
by Jim Harbaugh. Harbaugh
finished 10 of 15 for 157 yards
and ran for a touchdowp, helping
the Bears halt their three—game
slide. 4

-Finally, a note on the
Penguins. Tom Barasso
undergoes surgery today to repair
the broken wrist that

has hampered him since early in
the year. It’s a familiar tune, but
the Penguins are in trouble. The
Penguins were picked by most
experts to win the Patrick Division

For Choosin Our Plan Have
Noth1ngTO   0WithCost.

Quality care. From doctors who care. That’s what you
expect from your health plan. And at HealthAmerica, that’s exactly
what you get. ' ”

We’re affiliated with over 800 physicians who’ve received /’
their training from some of the finest universities and most A
prestigious internship and residency programs.

They’ve chosen to work with HealthAmerica for the same

«reasons so many people have chosen to join HealthAmerica. Because

we offer high quality health care. With no bills, no deductiblesand
no paperwork. -

We also cover preventive services in full. . .like mammo-
grams, periodic physicals, routine ob/gyn check-ups, pediatric
checkups and immunizations. Not to mention stress management
programs and smoking-cessation classes. (Traditional plans don’t
cover these services, which is why you might want to consider a
break in tradition.)

Andwhile many of our 110,000 members initially chose
our plan for the savings, they’ve remained HealthAmerica members
because of the expert care. And because they can choose any
Hea1thAmericadoctor they ’d like. a

So while cost may be one reason for choosing HealthAmerica,
we have over 800 others that are even more important. I
