Vet Shakeup

Stuart Workmaster, president of
the University’s Veterans’
ciation, announced this week thaty
he had received and accepted the
resignations of two members of
his board of directors.

The two officers are Earl Kelley,
who was editor of the association
newspaper “Fire Power,” and

licity, director and social chair-
man.

asso- :1;

Betty Wood

" Queried as to reasons for the
resignations, Workmaster stated:
“Kelley and Gibson, while excel-
lent men for their jobs, were
against the association’ becoming
involved in school_po1itics, while
my policy is to foster interest in

be able to advance the interests
of the student body.”

According to Kelley he resigned
“because I felt there was a move-
ment to turn the Veterans associa-
tion into a .political outﬁt-—and
originally it ‘was ‘founded on a
non—p0litical basis.” \

Gibson stated; “The organiza-
tion is not operating in conformity
with its constitution-. It is ‘a good
organization and has a valuable
place in student life, but I am
against having it enter school pol-
itics.”

.Workmaster said that both men
would be replaced at the next
election, when the. remaining
members of the board of directors
would passgupon the qualiﬁca-
tions of the men he has selected
as ~- possible successors. , .7
, Workmaster. in “Fire Power”
for February 10, 1947 stated: “The
Vets association has ‘been non-
political upto now, but I intend
to foster interest. in school poli-
tics. .where‘. the. association may
.be"abl'e to advance the. interests of

the student body. V

Barr Submits

Bill For Funds

A bill to increase the Univer-
sity’.s state appropriation by about
25 per cent for the two-year pe-
riod starting June 1 was intro-
duced in the state legislature
this week by Senator Joseph M.
Barr, Democrat of Pittsburgh.

The amount of the proposed
appropriation is $2,065,000 as
compared with $1,651,200 which
the University received from _the
state during the present biennium.

Representatives of the Chan-
cel1or’s ofﬁce conﬁrmed these ﬁg-
ures published in the daily pa-
ing and salary expenses. Faculty
members received a 21 per cent
salary increase since July, 1946,
and building [maintenance costs
have also increased.
pers, adding that the increase is,
needed to meet increased ‘operat-

Although this appropriation
cannot be used for additional
buildings, much of the increase
in funds will be needed’ to ex-
pand facilities to accommodate
this year’s ‘record enrollment of
21,780. ’

Chicago A Conference
Starts Student Group

To lay groundwork for formation of a permanent national
stud-ents-organization in America, delegates from over 300
colleges and universities representing 42 states met in Chicago
from Dec. 28 to 30, 1946, and set up a National Continuations
committee to carry out the preliminary confercnce’s program
and prepare for its subsequent meeting this summer.

The Chicago conference, in four panel discussion groups,

the proposed union, international
student activities, and generalvor-
ganizational detail. As a result, a
clearing house of information on
student exchange, travel, relief,
and rehabilitation was set up, and
possibilities of affiliation with the
International Union of Students
were discussed. The NCC also was
directed ‘to propose means for bet-
ter American participation in ex-
change, travel, and hospitality to
foreign students. ~
Heading the NCC, now organiz-
ing next summer’s conference, is“
James ‘Smith tofthe University of

considered aims and purposes of¢

Texas. ,O.the..1‘_ ofﬁcers are Russell

Austin of the University of Chi-.

cago, Vice- chairman; Clifford
Wharton of Harvard university,
secretary; and John Simmons of
Fordham university, treasurer.

The Chicago conference was pro-
posed by American delegates to
the International Union of Stu-
dents in Prague, where observa-
tions of national student unions
abroad suggested organization of a
similar group here.

Advance preparations for the
Chicago conference were made by
a committee from the Univeristy
of_Chicago headed by Austin.
Thorough discussion resulted in
general agreement on all issues.

New Nominating Plan

The revised plan for selecting
nominees was announced Monday »
by Betty Jane Wood, chief justice 6
of Senior court, at a mass meeting
of senior women. Formulated by?
WSGA and the senior class cabi- .
net, the new plan deviates slight-
ly from the procedure followed
in previous years.

For the first time, senior wom-_
en indicated tentative preferences
on Tuesday by a straw vote, ‘sub-
mitting the names of possible can-,
didates tﬁrough a suggestion box’
on the twelfth floor.

“The names submitted. were
neither votes nor ballots,” stated.
Justice Betty Jane Wood. “The?
selection of Senior Queen and ._
Alma Mater will be decided by?
the voting today.” A

Ex-Army Officers

Pitt men who served as com-
missioned officers during World
War II may now apply for a com-
mission in the regular Army, ac-
cording to a release from the War
department by John I. Hincke,
Colonel, CAC. This applies to all
college and university students
who will graduate before July
15, 1947. -

The new policy enables many
former officers to make a career
of the Regular Army. Previously,
some men could not apply for a
commission because they did not
have the required educational
qualiﬁcations. Now those receiv-
ing a college degree before July
15 may apply.

Interested men should consult

“life is very very hard in France and all is very expensive.”
enjoyed the snow this winter, but his mother “grumbled when shoes

were too damp because there was no money to repair them.”

Claude complains in his letter,
“As you know I am still small,
and I would like to be able to
write to you alone, but unfortu-
nately it would be too difficult for
me. I write like a cat, and I make
some mistakes. But soon, I be-
lieve, I shall be able to write to
you myself, and you will tell me
truthfully if I write badly.” His
older brother writes the letters,
but Claude tells him what to say.

Like most letter—writers, Claude
asks why he has received no an-
swer to his previous missives. “I
believe you have forgotten me or
that you have not received my
letters.’’ ,

“I am now reassured and per-
haps soon, if it is not too much to
expect on my part, I will receive
a small package of food or cloth-
ing.”

“You know without doubt that
my father was shot by the Ger-
mans because he saved an Eng-
lish 'parachu.tist. We have never
had any news from this soldier.
Perhaps. he has forgotten us, and
perhaps he has also been killed
following that. War is a horrible
thing, and one must never see it
again.”

After writing the letter, Claude
says that he and his family are
going to the fair in the village.
He likes particularly the wooden
horses and miniature autos.

“On the part of my mother, and
the whole family, I embrace you
very strongly. Best kisses from
your adopted son. Claude.”

Voss Scores
British Stand

In Palestine

“There is room for four million
more Jews in Palestine,” stated
Dr. Carl Voss at the Pitt town
meeting on Monday, March 17.

In his speech, which covered
most aspects of the Palestine ques-
tion, Dr. Voss’ stressed that it is
impossible for the Jews of Europe
to return to their own countries
because Hitler’s anti—semitic work
was so effective that its results
have persisted long after his
downfall.

One hundred-ﬁfty students who
assembled _at Stephen Foster me-
morial heard Dr. Voss explain
that the “white paper” imposing
law in Palestine was not legal be-
cause the territory is a “man-
date, not a colony.”

He also claimed that oil rights
are the crux -of the present dis-
pute. The British are appeasing
the Arabs even to the extent of
exonerating war criminals so that
they may be sure of their oil re-
serve of 100 billion barrels.

Dr. Voss, national chairman of
th American Christian Palestine
committee, insisted that Ameri-
cans are in many ways obligated
to assist in the solution of the
Palestine problem.

“Americans helped phrase the
Balfour, declaration, and they
helped break up the Ottoman em-
pire in the ﬁrst war. It is that
land that is now in dispute.” The
speaker also explainedthat Con-
gress twice sanctioned the parcel-
ling of land; in 1922, and again

in 1945.

No introduction this week .
too much news!

The Tri Delts, just to show their
eleven new pledges how energetic
they still could be after rushing,
threw a banquet at the Fairfax
last Tuesday night.

The good looking out-of-town-
ers you’ve been seeing about late-
ly are all Delts from‘ 19 different
schools of the East who are attend-
ing a regional conference of Delta
Tau Delta at the Roosevelt hotel.
They will stay long enough to be
feted with a dance Friday night
at the Pitt Delt house and a ban-
quet Saturday evening at the Uni-
versity club. The banquet will be
held in honor of Herbert McCrack-
en, national president.

No, it isn’t football season
again, but the Delta Zetas from
Penn State are having an open
house tomorrow. That means that
their sisters down here are invit-
ed, but they’re too excited about
the new pledges to take any trips!

This Friday the PiKA’s don their
injungarb for a dance at the To-
tem Pole Lodge in South Park.
And then these popular, popular
fellows get set for two tea dances
on Monday—The Kappa’s have
them in the afternoon and the
Zeta’s in the evening. Ah, what
a hard life these PiKA’s lead.

That Totem Pole Lodge is mak-

and Jim Ludwig

ing out! The Tech and Pitt
AEPhi’s are going to cram it with
blue jeans the night after the
PiKA’s move out, that is, if they’re
all gone by then! ‘ 1

Want to be a member of the
Minerva club? Then raise your son
to be an SAE, for the mothers of
the local lads have reorganized
and the name will be “Minerva
Club.”

After meeting, Monday, the new
Phi Mu pledges are going to get
a glimpse of what really goes on

day, the Theta pledges will get
the same. _ ;

Meetings of Beta Theta Pi cur-
rently are being held M.W.F. third
hour at the Blue Tuck Shop foun-
tain. There Betas Wild and Ter-
ry spend the hour canvassing
passers-by in their diligent search
for more Beta’s. C

These pledges are being treated
royally-—— for the present anyway.
Saturday night the Chi 0’s plan to‘
hurl a hard times dance at the
.house for their new ﬂoor scrub-
bers and dish-washers. ;

More big things in the frater-
nity world. The Sammies are
treating their new pledges to a
stag‘ this Sunday and the Phi
Delts treat their pledges (all 19
of them) to an initiation (the
word “treat” used loosely, of

course).

|Thru The Roster . . . w;..,, Zernicii 

With nothing but a small rubber ball and an old bushel basket
strung up on a telephone pole in the back alley, 10-year-old Wally

Zernich started playing basketball.

This back alley practice taught young Zernich
enough to earn ‘varsity positions in junior high
school, and on the starting team at Aliquippa high
school. He rapidly became one of Quip coach Nate

Lippe’s favorites.

Followed Brother to Pitt
Wally followed the footsteps of his older
brother, Steve to Pitt. Steve played ﬁne varsity
ball in ’41 and ’42. for the Panthers. Wally was
just establishing himself on the squad when he

left school to enter the Army.

He spent 16 months of his two
the European Theater. While he

basketball for the Fort Belvoir,4>-

Va. ﬁve. With Wally on this squad
were two all—American cagers.
Townsend andiBergman.

They played against some of
the outstanding service quintets
in the South. Although this com-
petition was stiff, Zernich’s team
piled up an enviable record __of
thirty wins and three defeats.

‘Likes Team Work

-“I really have never had any
one thing happen, to me that is
more outstanding than anytime
else but I do get. a kick out of
seeing a play work. It certainly is
a wonderful feeling to watch the
ball being worked and passed to
a man in the clear under the bas-
ket for an easy two points.”

Wally agrees with the other
Pitt boys in saying that this
year’s squad was the best with
whom he has ever played.

‘FIt’s just that we lost too many
games on fouls that we couldn’t
avoid committing because of our
lack of height.” The ‘hard-playing
Panther guard thinks that, with
the addition of one or two good,
tall men, Pitt will be a major
power on the hardwoods next
Winter. ,

“My thoughest opponent? The
Illinois ‘Whiz Kids’. And that I1-
lini guard, Gene Vance, was the
best all-around player I, have

Will Play In Tournament
.A pre-med student, Wally is
preparing to follow in his broth-

Although Pitt’s ﬂoor season
has been completed, Wally is not
yet ﬁnished with basketball for
this year. Along with Press Maro-
_vich of the Pittsburgh Ironmen,
Sam Milanovich, a former Pitt
cage captain, and his brother,
Steve, he plans to participate in
the Serbian Tournament in

an To Install

Single Wing Offens e

By John Golightly
Rock ’em, sock ’em football, Sutherland style, is back at
Pitt. And it’s being installed as a system right now. Pit-t’s
1947 gridiron machine is on the assembly line at the practice

ﬁeld below Trees gym.

Single Wing adherents, who have pooh-hooed the “T’f all
along, were promised plenty of power football by Walter (Mike)
Milligan, Panther football mentor.

“We’re going to use the single’
wing as it was originally set up
by Dr. ‘Jock Sutherland,” de-

he has not forsaken the ‘T” en-
tirely. He explained this by say-
ing:

“We have too many ﬁne quar-
terbacks to just disregard the
“T.” I can’t deﬁnitely say how
much of it will be used in our of-
fense: That will depend on our
opponents? and also, on how well
our quarterbacks can make the
switch to the single-wing run-
ning position; tailback.

“The ‘T’ was very effective last
year, and if it will ﬁt in with our
offense it will be used. But we
are basically a single-wing out-
ﬁt.” ,

Developing a few rugged block-
ers for the quarterback post is
one problem facing the Panther
headman. That’s a must for an ef-
fective single-wing offense. Pri-
marily, the spring drills will en-
able the coaching staff to get an
overall view of the squad.

Coach Milligan went on to ex-
plain, “Our practice’ field is too
small to operate effectively with
a large group. That’s why we
scheduled the tWo—week informal
drills which began Monday.

CADDY'S ATLANTIC
SERVICE STATIOII

Forbes and Craig, SC. 9737

“We want to be sure we aren’t
overlooking anyone, and we in
tend to give every boy a chance
to show his ability,” he emphasiz-
ed.

He pointed out that during this
period there will be blocking,
tackling, and scrimmaging. Also
on the agenda is continued use of
Dr. Carlson’s fatigue curve for
determining the physical con-
dition of athletes.

The fatigue curve will be a
regular part of the informal drills
and also the regular spring prac-
tice which follows immediately
afterward.

Right now the Panther head-
man doesn’t know what will com“
stitute his biggest problem for
the coming season. He hopes to
discover most of the kinks dur-
ing the spring drills. But he is
very deﬁnite, about one thing.

, “The morale last year was ex-
cellent and I couldn’t ask for a
ﬁner bunch of boys,” he said.

,“These kids have plenty of heart

and that’s what counts lmore than
anything else. Without that, you
just aren’t a football player,” he
concluded. ‘

It’s still an uphill climb, but the
Panthers are headed in the right
direction-—up.

Capture Second Half Championship

Bostock, and Johnny Kosh.

Pitt Y. Enters
YMCA Finals

Although they required a play-
off to do it,’the Pitt Y basketball
team captured the second half ti-
tle in the YMCA hoop league.

They squelched a last—period
rally to overcome the ﬂoor ﬁve
of the East Liberty Y, 61-52, last
Friday night on the Allegheny
court.

Tony Razzano again sparked
the Pittites, slamming home 31‘
points for the winners. Alert team
play of Leo Skladany and Marty
Rosepink enabled the swift Raz-
zano to lay in many of his buckets
from up close.

Although Pitt led all the way,

quarter and pulled within four
points of the victors, Razzano put
the damper on this surge by con-
necting on four shots from far
out in the closing minutes. _
This playoff win entitled the
Pitt boys -to meet the Allegheny
Y—ﬁrst half victors—-—in a three-
game series for the YMCA cham-
pionship. The ﬁrst game was play-
ed on Wednesday evening.
Skladany, Rosepink, and Raz-
zano have been outstanding dur-
ing the second half chase. Fine
court play of Dick Bostock and

John Kosh have been important

factors in all Y victories.

Capable substitutes were avail-
able in McConnell, Keenan, and
Gallagher. Clause and Gallagher

served faithfully in performing

the administrative functions.

New End Coach

Added to Staff

Pitt was practically assured of
an all—Pitt football coaching staff
with the announcement of the
signing of Robert W. Timmons as
end coach.

Timmons is the second assist-
ant appointed by Walter (Mike)
Milligan since he took over the
head coaching post.

Timmons entered Pitt in 1930 -

and went on to play three years
of Varsity ball under Dr. John

B. (Jock) Sutherland. He and“

Joe Skladany were the Panther
terminals during the 1933 cam-
paign.‘.

Following graduation, he put in
ﬁve years directing football and
basketball at nearby New Bright-
on high school. His high school
reoord was 29 wins against 12
losses.

In 1939 he took over as head
mentor at Indiana State Teachers
college. The following season his
eleven won the State Teachers
championship with a record of
seven wins and one tie.

Timmons, entered the Navy in

1943, an-d although it was ten
years since he last played, he held
down an end berth on the Iowa
Pre—Flight powerhouse of 1943.
Perry Schwartz held down the
other terminal.

After duty on an escort carrier
in the Pacific in 1944 and 1945,
Tirnmons returned to Indiana
State to direct the grid team.

The acquisition of Tirnmons
practically completes Coach Mil-
ligan’s strategy board for the com-
ing season. The new end Cloach
began his duties yesterday.
