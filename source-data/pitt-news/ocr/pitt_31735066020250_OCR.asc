Pitt students face charges of assault, trespass

By Jill Carell

Sta ff Writer

Two Pitt students have been
summoned for a hearing with the
district justice in connection with
the beating of another student in
his girlfriend's north Oakland
apartment on Nov. 8, according
to reports filed with Pittsburgh
police.

Cam Baker, 19, Richard Platt,
20, Mark McCormick, 21, and
Bob Wooldridge, 23, allegedly
entered an apartment at 222 Mel-
wood Avenue where Baker and
Platt physically abused the
tenant's boyfriend, Donald

Schambach, 20, according to
police reports and sources‘ in-
volved. -

Baker and Platt have been ac-
cused of simple assault and crimi-
nal trespass, -according to city
police. Their hearing has been
scheduled for Dec. 19.

The following account was
taken from police reports in
which Wooldridge and Platt were
notidentified: “

Baker, McCormick and two
unidentified students [Platt and
Wooldridge] entered the apart-
ment at approximately 8:10 p.m.

The four students became very
loud and refused to leave when

the tenant asked. Schambach
then placed his hand on Baker's
arm and asked him to leave. Bak-
er pulled his arm away and told
Schambach not to touch him.
McCormick exited" the apart-
ment with one of the unidentified
students [Wooldridge]. At that
time, Schambach told the other

unidentified student [Platt] to

leave. In response Baker punched
him in the face. Baker and the
unidentified student [Platt] then
rammed Schambach’s head
against a metal closet door.
Schambach fell to the floor,
whereupon Baker and the
unidentified student [Platt]

punched him. Schambach’s girl-
friend and her roommate tried to
stop them, but Baker said he
would beat them if they inter-
fered. Baker and the unidentified.
student [Platt] soon left.
Schambach sustained a large
bruise on his forehead and sever-
al cuts in and around his mouth.
Baker and the unidentified stu-
dent [Platt] returned approximate-

A ly 10 mi_nutes later and pounded
on the door. They shouted,-
"’Send your boyfriend out. We

want to mess him up.”
Schambach declined
comment. 4

Reaction harsh to proposed elderly transplant ban

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

Two weeks ago, Daniel Calla-
han, director of the Hastings
Center in New York, said the na-
tion should avoid costly treat-

1 ments, such as transplants, for

those over the age of 80.

Callahan believes the resources
currently being allocated to the
elderly might be better spent on
the young. He stated that the only
care given to those over 80
should be to ease suffering.

Cal|ahan’s remarks have drawn
a strong reaction from the Pitts-
burgh medical community. Tom

Chakurda, assistant director of
media at Presbyterian-University
Hospital, strongly opposes Calla-
han’s ideas.

”We believe that the therapeu-

tic benefits of a certain treatment
should be individually weighed,
regardless of a person's age,"
Chakurda said.

Contras violates a World Court
decision, in which the court
ruled that aiding the Contras
was unlawful.

According to Lobel, the suit
is targeted specifically at the
Reagan administration and
represents the World Feder-
alists, the Committee of
American Citizens living in
Nicaragua and other U.S. or-
ganizations that provide hu-
manitarian services to the
people in Nicaragua.

”l think that we agreed in
‘the United Nations Charter to
obey World Court decisions,”
Lobel said. ”That U.N. Chart-
er is under the U.S. Constitu-

tion and is part of the supreme -

law of the United States. I felt
that it was hypocritical and in-
consistent for the United States
to do this. I felt. it was impor-
tant to challenge the legality of

the [actions of the] United

States.”

Chakurda sees Cal|ahan’s con-

”We as citizens, and not just
myself, have an obligation to
do" something to prevent the
United States from killing peo-

ple abroad,” Lobel said. ’’I ‘'

think that at the Nuremberg tri-
als we said that individual
Germans had international
responsibilities to try to pre-
vent aggressive war, and that
we in the United States should
take those obligations
seriously." .
Lobel said he has a chance
ofwinning, but because it is a

novel case, it will be ”an up- '

hill fight.”

’’If we win, we will have
one established principle that
the United States must abide
by international law. _We
would save thousands of
Nicaraguan lives and possibly
American lives from being lost
in a senseless war,” he said.

cept as being highly unethical.

”We at‘Presby do not believe
an age cap is prudent; age limits
should not be the ultimate deter-
mining factor,” he said.

Marty Walsh, director of pub-'

lic relations at Allegheny Gener-
al Hospital, shares Chakurda’s

. ”lt’s one’s condition,” Walsh _

said, ”and not [one’s] age which‘

should be taken into considera-_ ’

MANILLA — Philippines Presi-

Sunday that she had foiled a coup
attempt against her government,
and that she had forced her en-
tire cabinet to resign, including
Defense Minister.Juan Ponce En-

rile. The whereabouts of Enrile '

and Aquino were not immediate-
ly known.

Coup rumors have been cir-
culatingin recent weeks after En-
rile, who was instrumental in
helping Aquino depose Ferdi-
nand Marcos, openly criticized
Aquino for her handling of a
communist insurgency. Enrile felt
Aquino was being‘ too easy on
the Communist rebels and was
not taking enough military steps
to crush them.

Aquino has been trying to
negotiate a peace agreement with
the rebels rather than defeating
them in an all-out military en-
gagement. '

MANAG UA, Nicaragua — Sal-

is feeling ”pretty down” but is
”holding up” in prison.

Hasenfus has been sentenced
to 30 « years. in prison by a

the Contra rebels.

ly said the trial of Hasenfus was
a ”kangaroo court" that is in no
way similar to an American trial.

Meanwhile, in Nicaragua,
President Daniel Ortega said Sun-
day that Hasenfus received ”a
light sentence.” Ortega said the
30-year prison term given Hasen-
fus is far lighter than would be
given a Nicaraguan convicted of
the same offense in the United
States.

There have been hints from
several officials in the pro-Soviet
Nicaraguan government in recent
weeks that Hasenfus might be
pardoned anyway, as a sign of
good will, but Sally Hasenfus said
she has not received word on any
possible pardon.

Moderately—priced hotel to be built in Oakland

By Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer

Rezoning for the proposed con-
struction of an office building, a

‘hotel and a parking garage at the
. intersection of Forbes Avenue

and Boulevard of the Allies was
approved last weekat the City
Council meeting.

The project, a joint venture be-
tween the Oakland Planning and
Development Corp. and the Na-
tional Development Corp., hope-
fully will help a depressed
portion of Oakland, according to
Sandra Phillips, executive direc-
tor for the OPDC.

Dieting myths won

CARSON, Calif. (AP) — Much
of the blame for the failure to suc-
cessfully lose weight is on the
pervasiveness of a number of
myths about dieting, according to
Bobbi Mitzenmacher, who runs
.a weight control group at Califor-
nia State University, Dominguez
Hills. ’

Mitzenmacher, a health educa-
tor and psychology instructor at
the university, refuted these com-
mon misconceptions about
dieting: ’ - .

I —- Fad diets work: Short-term
plans such as living on just
grapefruit or bananas are not the
answer. When the person goes
back to- his or her previous eating
habits, there’s»a rebound effect.
Then the body develops more fat
cells. ~

— Exercise increases the ap-

/ petite: Moderate exercise doesn't

increase the appetite. When you
decrease activity, that leads to
putting on weight.

”We’ll be taking an area that is
blighted and underused and
building it up,” Phillips said.

The land for the project, called
the Oakland Portal Develop-
ment, was acquired with loans
totaling $1 million from private
investors.

Negotiations for the land are
nearly complete, according to
Phillips. There are a few transac-
tions still to be concluded, in-
cluding the gaining of property

from Point Park College and a .

"used car dealership.

sistance of the City Planning

meal, what usually happens is
you're much hungrier the next
time you eat and then you con-

sume more. It seems the body _

operates better with food coming
in regularly.

— Dieting will make you feel
weak or fatigued: If you follow a
sensible diet plan, your energy
.level will remain normal.

‘ — Most people need to lose
weight: While there are an esti-

imated 32 million -overweight

Americans, many more are taken
in by society's idea of what you
should look like. Our country's
ideal of beauty is not realistic for
many people's body types, so we
find many people obsessed with
dieting who shouldn't be.

— You should lose weight as
quickly as possible: On the con-
trary, slow, steady weight loss is
much longer lasting.

Knowing what not to do, how-
ever, is only part of the answer for
those who need to slenderize,
Mitzenmacher said, noting that

Council, have applied for an Ur-
ban Development Action Grant
for funding to help defray the cost
of the hotel, thus making it more
affordable to the guests.

The hotel might not be built if
the grant isn't approved, but the
other construction will certainly
occur, -Phillips asserted.

”Oak|and needs a hotel that's
moderate in price,” Phillips ex-
plained. ”People visiting the
health centers in Oakland usual-
ly need a less expensive place to

. stay, especially if they're going to

be staying for more than one
night.”

t lead to

dieting demands an approach
which takes in multiple factors,
including exercise, psychological
issues and nutrition.

Dieters should first consider the

\

_ psychological . reasons behind

their obesity, she said.

”A lot of people have to make
the connection that food is used
for comfort, nurturing, as a way
of dealing with stress and as a
way to deal with feelings,” Mit-
zenmacher said. ”This goes for
both extremes —— for the obese
and for the anorexic. Dealing
with food is a way of not dealing
with issues.”

Dieters must also realize they
are losing weight for themselves,
not for a husband, a mother or a
boyfriend, she said.

She suggests dieters keep a

‘ ”food diary” describing what was

eaten, when it was eaten, the set-
ting and the feelings the person
had while eating, as‘ a means of
gaining insight into the psycho-
logical causes- of overeating.

The projected rate for a room
at the hotel will be $50 to $70
per night, according to Phillips,
and some of the rooms will in-
clude kitchens which may be
used as suites for visitors planning
extended stays.

- ”We are negotiating with
several groups for management
of the hotel,” said Philips.

The hotel is expected to create
more than 100 new jobs, with ad-
ditional jobs becoming available
in the office building.

Thefoffice building is proposed

primarily for use by doctors and

other outside support for the
hospitals in the area.

The'Pittsburgh Playhouse will
remain in the area as a cultural
anchor, Philips sajd, and might
be opening a restaurant.

Partof the parking garage to be
built under the other structures
and owned by Magee-Womens

Hospital will be open to the pub- I

Iic to help alleviate the parking
problem in Oakland.

”The parking garage will pro- , .

to the Playhouse in the evening,” A

Phillips concluded.

Construction for the project

should commence in March
1987 and be completed in Janu-
ary 1988.

quick weightloss T

”Often people don't eat be-
cause they're hungry, but be-
cause they're depressed, angry or
lonely,” Mitzenmacher said.

In order to lose weight suc-
cessfully, dieters also need a sup-
port system such as a weight loss
group.

”When you don't use fad diets,
dieting is a long, slow process.
You need the help of others to
keep motivated,” she said.
”Remember, even if you lose one

«pound a week — you've lost 52

pounds in a year.”

Exercise is another essential
component to successfully shed-
ding weight, ‘Mitzenmacher
pointed out. ~

”Look for something you enjoy
doing,” she advised. ”You don't
have to jog. You can do walks. if
you enjoy going to a gym, do
that. It can be stationary bicycles.
lt’s not just what you eat, but how
many calories you burn, and
increasing the activity level
seems to help change the

metabolism. '
”There’s a set point, which is

a weight your body is comfort- ' A

able at. Your body works to keep

the set point. A combination of_
reduced food ‘intake with in- '
creased exercise helps to change‘

the set point. This” takes time.”

Another weapon in the war on '

fat is behavior modification. A
dieter needs to learn such be-
haviors as howlto eat more slow-
ly, to eat at regular times, to

— control the size of food portions

and how to order in restaurants,
she explained.

Finally, an overweight person

must be counseled on nutrition,

she added. Developing a sensible '
diet is necessary to avoid the

medical consequences of obesity,
such as high blood pressure and
strokes. '

”Being overweight can have i

negative health consequences,
but so can fad dieting,” she said.
”So it's much better for people to
select a healthy eating plan than
to go for a short-term solution.”

Gottfried bringing

good things to Pitt

Mike Gottfried’s first season as head coach of the Pitt
Panthers ended Saturday. The season, with its
many ups and downs, concluded quietly. "

Gottfried inherited a team in poor shape. Former coach Ser-
afino Fazio. had allowed the team to become too independent
of its responsibility to the Pitt tradition and relied too much
on the dying spirit of the teams in the '70s. Fazio was a part
of those teams but failed to grasp the idea that each team must

find a spirit of its own.

Only a few weeks after his arrival, Gottfried dispelled the
idea that no player could do wrong. The suspension of players
and harsh discipline, enforced from the first day of camp, taught
the players a responsibility to themselves.

It is this self-respect Gottfried has sought to achieve that will
carry the teams of the future — and there is no reason the fu-

ture can't be a bright one.

Next season may see the return of Brian Davis at running
back. The addition of Davis to a backfieldincluding Craig Hey-
ward and Charles Gladman will give Gottfried something solid
to work with from the outset of the season.

Perhaps the biggest change this season involved Craig Hey-
ward. Before Gottfried’s arrival, Heyward had difficulty off the

field and was inconsistent_on the field.

This year brought a change of attitude for Heyward which
often carried the rest of the team. He believed he could do well

when few others did.

Lastseason ended sourly, with nothing more to look forward
to than a new coach. This season ends after small bursts of ex-
cellence and excitement on the field and with respect for the
responsibility of being a student-athlete off the field.

We were indeed,”in for a game.” With Gottfried at the helm,

next season can only get better.

Reagan was right with Iran deal

The recent public disclosure
that the United States sent secret
shipments of arms, spare parts
and supplies to Iran is on a lot of
people's minds. It's still going to
be a while before the public
learns all of the facts — or enough
of the facts as the government
would have us know." ’

Frankly, it's none of the pub-
lic’s business. _

It's naive. to think that the
government — or certain factions
of it — will. inform the public

. about sensitive issues, covert or

deniable actions for example.
When the public voted certain
candidates into office, a vote of
trust was bestowed upon them.
These are the men and women
who have to sift through moun-
tains of facts and make decisions,
none of which have to be im-
mediate. They are allowed to
plan a few years down the road.
Why not? The Soviets have, too.
In four and a half generations,
the Soviets have metamorpha—
sized from an armed rabble into
a major superpower, something
that did not come about without
foresight. To win, one must antic-
ipate the opponent's possible
moves, and make countermoves.
Shipping arms — covertly — to

it a place at which to learn? Is it
a place at which to play ball? Or
maybe a place where uncultured,
immature "students" rise to high
student offices?

I am a Chancellor's Scholar in
the class of '89. Now to The Pitt
News and its cross-section of
readers, that probably doesn't
mean much. Pitt's football play-
ers, or RSA or SGB members are,
for some reason, much written
about, when others, interested in
learning and contributing to this
university on a more concrete

At Forbes Hall the walls are

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 24, I986

   

Miss America was in my fraternity bedroom  

minutes, and then — again, as if '~

’’I’m stuck on the bed,” said
Miss America. ‘

Indeed she was. Miss America
— Kellye Cash of Tennessee '-
was standing in my old bedroom
in my old college fraternity
house. She had backed up against
a wooden bunk bed, and a splin-
ter from the bed had snagged her
knit dress.

While'Miss America worked to
extricate herself from her predica-
ment, I thought back to how all
of this had come about. It was
easily the most immature thing I
had done in at least a month.

It began when I received a tele-
phone call from a publicist repre-
senting Miss America. Miss
America would be in Evanston,
Ill.,' making personal appear-
ances, the publicist said. The
publicist would be more than
happy to bring Miss America
down to Chicago if I wished .to in-

» terview her.

In the wink of an eyelash, a

‘plan formed in my mind.

”There’s no need to bring her
to Chicago,” I said. ”I would be
more than happy to come to
Evanston.” ‘

Evanston happens to be the
place where I went to college —

to Northwestern University.
When I first arrived on campus in
the mid '60s, there were still ex-
tremely strict rules about male
and female students visiting in
each others’ rooms. It simply
wasn't allowed. In the dormito-
ries it virtually never happened,
and in the fraternities it happened
only rarely, and always with the
utmost secrecy. To take a girl up

to your room was a daring ven— '

ture fraught with danger. Theoret-
ically, youcould get kicked out
of school for doing it. _

I was a member of a fraternity
called Phi Epsilon Pi. Phi Ep died,
both at Northwestern and nation-
ally, during the years of the so-
called Student Revolution when
campus men andwomen were

far too busy with radical politics I

to argue about things so mun-
dane as fraternities and sororities.
So Phi Ep is no more — but the
old Phi Ep house still stands in’
Evanston with another fraternity
in residence.

And now I knew I had to do it.
All those cold Northwestern
nights, my fraternity brothers. and
I walking coeds back to their
dorms and sorority houses before
curfew time and then returning to

    

 

BOB GREENE

our lonely rooms at the Phi l:p
house. This could make up for all
of it.

I had to get Miss America up to
my old fraternity room.

I called the fraternity house and
spoke to the current president. I
said that I was going to be on
campusat a certain time that
Saturday. ”My old room is the
one at the top of the stairs,” I said,
”the one with the ledge outside
the window. Please make sure
the room is unlocked.”

He vowed to comply.

And so it was that I met up with
Miss America at the Orrington,
Hotel in Evanston. We shook
hands, and she prepared to begin

the interview. —

”I’|| tell you what,” I said.
”Why don't we just walk around
the campus?”

”That sounds fine,” she said.

We headed up Sheridan Road.
”Being on campus makes me
really miss being astudent,” Miss
America said. ”I’m a junior at
Memphis State, and I look for-
ward to returning to classes as
-soon as my yearas Miss Ameri-
ca is over.”.

”Uh huh,” I said. ”Why don't
we turn this way?”

And we were on fraternity row.
I passed all of the houses — DU,
Sigma Chi, Delta Tau Delta, SAE,
Phi Delt. I felt as if I were on a
mission for all the frustrated
fraternity men of my era. .

”Say!” I said with what I hoped
was a believable facsimile of
genuine surprise. ”There’s my
old fraternity house!”

And I steered Miss America up
the walk and throughithe front
doon

There were about a dozen fra-
ternity members lounging around
the living room. I introduced my-
self, and then I introduced Miss
America.

We all chatted for several

I had just thought of it — I said:

”|’ve got a wonderful idea!
Why don't-we go up and see
what my old room looks like?”

Thus, Miss America and I, ac-
companied by the current college
fraternity men, trudged up the
stairs and into my room. ‘

I felt like Neil Armstrong taking
his first step onto the moon.

And, having taken that first‘
step, I had no idea what to do. '

The room was decorated with
a poster of thelate John Belushi,
a picture of a Porsche automobile
and a giant replica ofa gin bottle.

I pointed out the window to the
ledge and said to Miss America,
’’I remember the spring that Sgt.

Pepper's’ ‘Lonely Hearts Club.

Band came out. We'd lie in the
sun on that ledge and play the al-
bum hour after hour.”

”Gosh, that was before I was I

born,” Miss America said. 4 .
”Not true,” I said. ’’I did some
research. You were 2.”

This is the point at which Miss -

America backed into the wooden
bunk beds and became entangled
on the splinter. She wriggled free.

We left soon after. You can be in

my dream if I can be in yours.

A daydream about growing up in America

I was thinking about the future
yesterday, something nearly eve-

- ry college student does from time

to time. I was trying to imagine
in what kind of world the next

, generation was going to grow up.

About 10 minutes into the day-
dream, things went sour. Maybe

I have an -affection for the dark.

side, but I'm really worried — sort
of.

I had a vision of the ultimate
”concerned parents" organiza-
tion. They were everything to
which the current groups seem to

‘aspire. They had drawn up a

charter for their organization and
had everything neatly ration-
alized. . '

It was a well organized and
powerful group, but a little mis-
guided. In their latenight bull ses-
sions, trying to decide where to
start changing society, they had

a little too much to drink and got '

a small piece of the Pledge of Al-

legiance wrong. Instead of ”one
nation under God,” they thought
the words were ”one nation un-
der my God.”

Oh, my God. .

Well, what diffe_r_ence can one
little word make? It was only two
letters. Two letters can't hurt any-
thing, can they?

Most pairs‘ of letters couldn't

‘make much difference, but this

pair was different. It's staggering

to imagine how many lives have '

been wasted throughout history
because of that possessive
pronoun. _
Back to the future, though.
The organization, Parents In-

terested in Politics, was continu- v

ally quoted in the press
concerning subjects such as rat-
ing music, rating textbooks and

.' rating TV shows.

All first rate, no doubt. .
In my daydream, I saw the_pro-
testors in front of Capitol Hill,

waving signs. As I got "closer, I
saw they were protesting the evils,
in literature.

”To|stoy will warp our chil-
dren's minds,” they said. ”Down
with J.D. Salinger.”

_ ”What’s the matter with Tol-
stoy?” I asked, getting a little con-
cerned because I liked his books.

’He promotes the evils of a
godless society, it's right there in
his books,” a particularly articu-
late mari told me.

”Was it really that obvious to
you when you.read the book?" I
asked. ,

”Of course, any fool could see
it,” he replied.

”Then why do you want the

Somestray thoughts about

Leftovers from the Pitt-Penn
State party tailgate:

0 A Pitt alumnus who now is
pursuing a doctorate degree at
Penn State showed me a letter on
Saturday that he received in the
mail from Pitt.

It was a letter asking for mone-
tary contributions to the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, but it was not
a letter directly from Pitt. It was
from Gene Kelly, the‘guy who
used to dance opposite Ginger
Rogers. He is a 1933 graduate of
Pitt. I doubt that Kelly actually
wrote the letter himself, but they
still used his name.

Two questions:
1. How far behind Roy
Rogers did Kelly finish in the

process to select this year's
homecoming marshal?

2. Why doesn't the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh have Roy Rogers

OI look at the exhibition

’ basketball schedule Pitt has this

year, and has had for the past four
years, and I wonder why Penn
State is not on the schedule.

Pitt plays West Virginia and
Duquesne, both from the Atlan-
tic I0. Why not play Penn State,
also from the Atlantic 10?

0 Speaking of Penn State bas-
ketball, all during the football
game at Beaver,Stadium on Satur-
day, the stadium announcer kept
promoting‘ Penn State's Blue-
White basketball scrimmage.
Boy, that sounded exciting.

I _ 0 I went to State College with

two other guys. One goes by the
handle ”Wilbur," and the other

'answers to the name‘ ”Schoo|

Yar .”

Wilbur got his nickname in"
grade school,. but it is too'com-
plicated to explain why. School
Yard never runs the plays when

he plays like he is in a school
yard. That's how he got his nick-
name. ‘ ‘

Anyway, Wilbur goes to West
Virginia University while School
Yard attends Slippery Rock Uni-
versity. Neither of them cares
about Gene Kelly, but both agree
with me that State College seems
to be in its ownlittle world, iso-

book banned?” I wondered out
loud. .

”I don't want my child's mind
to be warped with that trash," the
words fairly flew from his mouth.

”If it's so obvious to you, then
why do you ,think your kid

-wouldn't see it the same way?”

I questioned.

About this time, a group of
youths walked by, dressed in
black leather jackets that said
”down with everything” on the
back.

”There,” the man said to me,
”look at that. Those kids proba-
bly listen to rock music and read
Tolstoy. I don't want my daugh-
ter to be like that." .
, ”What’s the matter with rock
music?" The conversation had

a suddenly taken an-even more

personal turn. I like rock music,

“Those kids listen to that mu-
sic about killing and anarchy so

There were actually police
walking around to the tailgate
parties checking to see if people
were of age. Can you see Pitts-
burgh Police walking around the
parking lot of the Syria Mosque,
citing kids for underage drinking
before a Pitt football game?

Additionally, a story appeared
in the Centre Daily Times about
how the Penn-State football play-
ers pitched in cash to fly one of
the players’ (Tim Manoa) parents
to "State College from Hawaii to
watch the game.

Did you ever hear that. old
phrase, It only.happens in’the
movies? Perhaps it should be
rephrased to, It only happens in
Happy Valley.

First of all, bringing someone
from Hawaii to State College is
cruel. I_thought that kind of stuff
was banned by the Geneva Con-
vention.

‘Secondly, only Penn State
would have the guts. to promote

much they start acting like the
songs tell them to.” -

” Do you really think the mu-
sic has that much influence over
them?”

”Of course, any fool could see .

”If music can do all that, why
didn't we have peace in the 60s
when everyone was singing

”Well, that's different,” he told
me. .

”Why?”

”Because, that's what we think.
This is my protest, I'll ‘say what I
want. It's God's will.” '

I didn't see the connection, but
I woke up before I could ask
about it. ’ —

It was nice to wake up into a
world where that kind of narrow-
mindedness doesn't exist, where
people are free to read and listen
to whatever they want.

I hope it ‘stays that way.

tai lgates  

propaganda like that, and only
the central ' Pennsylvania
newspapers would print it.

School Yard questioned where
the money really came from, and
Wilbur just said, ”I’m sick.”

0 I saw enough ”Shitt on Pitt”
garb on Saturday to last me for a
few years. Then there is the ”If
you can't go to college, go to
Pitt” slogan, which every Nitta-
ny Lion fan says, as if he or she
made it up.

Editor's note: This is the sec-
ond part of an article on The Chil-
dren of War Tour. ‘The purpose of
the tour, sponsored by the Reli-
gious Task Force Education Fund,
is to show American students
what life is like for their counter-
parts in nations torn apart by war
or its aftermath.

Rima Zankowl, 18, is from Leb-
anon and attends Beirut Univer-
sity College. She lives among
bombs, gunfire and death.

”Because of the bombing; we
can't always go to school. I've
watched one of my best friends
die in front of me, knowing that
there was nothing I could do,"
said Rima.

gOften she and her family have
gone without many necessities,
including food, because of the
high cost of living in Lebanon.
Even when there is food and
money, the bombs can prevent
people from being able to buy it.

”The worst thing is that it is the
innocent that die, the women and
Iittle.kids, not the fighters. The
fighters have the weapons to de-

fend themselves. We don’t,” said ‘

Rima, who hasbeen one of the
most outspoken members of the
tour. '

JACKSON, Miss. -— Students in
rural Claiborne County are turn-
ing back the pages of area histo-
ry —— not in books, but by talking
to and writing about those who
lived it.

For an oral history project, Port
Gibson High School students in-
terview elderly residents who
helped weave the fabric of life in
the county along the Mississippi
River, tape-recording their tales of
days gone -by and transcribing
them for publication.

Their recollections and lessons
on life are published verbatim in
a magazine called I Ain't Lying.

’’It gives students agbetter sense
of history because they're learn-
ing about the ordinary people
who helped make it,” said
Patricia Crosby, the 43-year-old
housewife and amateur pho-
tographer who oversees publica-
tion of the magazine.

The title, chosen by students
who published the first issue in
1980. is appropriate for this pre-
dominantly, black county of
12,000, Crosby said. She said
folks often begin favorite tales
with the disclaimer, ”I ain't lying,
now!”

Personalities featured in the

magazine's’three volumes range

Her tale centers on the battles be-
tween the New Peoples Army
and the Philippine government.

”Many kids are surprised or
almost indignant when I tell them
about the atrocities the govern-
ment, which the United States
backs, is doing to us,” Araos said.

Her father was arrested by the

military when she was one year-

old and held for over two years.
He was arrested for being a ”stu-

‘ dent activist” and speaking out

against the government.

Her mother, pregnant with
Waya’s younger brother at the
time, was also arrested. Accord-
ing to Waya, doctors attributed
her brother's birth defects to the
rough handling her mother re-
ceived in captivity.

Lotey Kiluwe, 18, is also on the
tour. He is from the Marshall Is-
lands, an old testing site for U.S.
nuclear research.

Lands that used to grow abun-
dant crops are now empty. The
food that is grown there is usual-
ly poisonous because of nuclear
testing done in 1946-50.

U.S. personnel working to clean
up the islands, but they are not
doing enough; and for too many,
it is too late. ' '

All three of these students, plus
59 other participants, have come
to the United States on this tour
to try to make American students
understand their plight and to ask
for help.

The willingness of the students
to help is evident from the num-
ber of kids who came for the
Youth Farm held last Wednesday
at the downtown YMCA. The
Youth Farm brought together in-
terested students from the Pitts-
burgh area and students from the
foreign countries who are on the

tour. The students formed an ac-
tion group designed to help
spread the word about the
problems of these other nations.

After the group, tentatively
named Youth Cry, is better or-
ganized, they plan to begin_letter
and petition campaigns and pos-
sibly demonstrations.

Waya was very glad that the -

students are getting involved. She
thought that ”most kids in Ameri-
ca are more worried about what
they are going to wear on Satur-
day and where they are going to
get their alcohol than they are
about what is going on in the
world.”

The _students found it almost
unbelievable how little American
students know about what is go-
ing on in the rest of the world.

After the tour, however, Waya .
and many others changed their »

views about Americans.

"Before, I thought all of Ameri-
ca was filled with the rich,”
Waya said. ”After staying in New
York for three days, I realized that
the U.S‘. also has -poor and home-
less problems.”

Michael Glabicki, the Baldwin
High School group leader, ex-
plained, ”When you hear it on
the news you say, ‘Oh how terri-
ble,’ but when you actually meet
the person, it makes you realize
how selfish you've been. It makes
it real.”

Mary Green, a freshman at Pitt
who is in the group, noticed im-
mediately how much more ma-
ture the foreign students are
compared to their American
counterparts.

”Americans are very sheltered.
We have no idea what many of
these kids go through,” said
Green.

The group that the students are
forming, Youth Cry, is named af-
ter the Baldwin High prodigee.
Many of the members of that
group went to listen to ex-CIA
spokesman John Stockwell speak.

Stockwell discussed many of
the atrocites that the CIA had
committed in Nicaragua.

Glabicki believes that the CIA
”should not be teaching rebels to
mangle children and throw them
into the garbage. They should be
teaching peace.”

When the Baldwin group first
formed, there was little support
given to them from the admini-
stration. After the administration
realized, however, that the group
was not trying to be radical but
only to learn and look for ways
to achieve peace, the school lent
support to some of the group's ac-
tivities.

Any students interested in get-
ting involved should contact the
Pittsburgh Peace Institute, Peace
Links or the Baldwin Youth Cry
group at 885-6215. ’

Reagan still under
fire from congress 
for Iranianarms sale

By Jill Lawrence‘
AP Writer '

WASHINGTON — President

‘Reagan's arms sale to Iran con-

tinued under siege Saturday, with
a Democratic spokesman calling
it ”a terrible bl-under" that has
thrown the administration's anti-
terrorism policy into disarray.
”The president broke the law;
he broke faith with our friends
and allies around the world; and
he broke his word to the Ameri-
can people,” Rep. Tony Beilen-

son, D—Calif., said ‘in the
Democrats’ week-ly radio
address.

”The sad fact of the matter is
that our anti-terrorism policy is
now in shambles,” Beilenson

‘ said. ”Let us hope‘ that this taw-

dry chapter is at an end. Let us
hope our president manages our
foreign policy during the next
two years in a competent and
constitutional manner.”

Controversy has engulfed the
administration since the dis-
closure of its covert contacts with
Iran during the past 18 months as
well as arms shipments made
shortly before the individual
‘releases of three U.S. hostages
held in Lebanon.

Amid reports of administration

infighting, congressional leaders A

of both parties have criticized the
administration for creating the
perception that the United States
swapped arms for hostages.

Many critics have said Reagan
violated the law by keeping Con-
gress in the dark, violated a U.S.
policy of neutrality in the Iran-
Iraq war and undercut his own
drive to keep other countries

from selling arms to terrorist .

nations. A
‘Reagan, whose actions first

caméto light in a Syrian publica- ’

tion in Beirut, said his goal was,
and _continues to be, to establish
ties with moderate Iran_ian
officials. _ . _ ' _ ' » .

» White House Chief of Staff Don

,-t

Regan compared _the Reagan
policy to President Nixon's secret
initiative in 1972 that led to a re-
establishment of ties with China.

”I think the juryis still out on
whether the operation Itself was
conducted correctly," Regan said
in an interview published in
Saturday's Washington Pos.t.
”Will it succeed? I don't think the
final chapter has been written on
that.”

But Beilenson said the policy
already had failed, citing Secre-
tary of State George Shu|tz’s com-
ments that Iran continues to
sponsor terrorist acts and has
been implicated in the recent kid-
nappings of-three more Ameri-
cans in Beirut. '

”How can we even pretend to
wage a war against terrorism
while we are providing arms to’
terrorists?” Beilenson asked his

‘radio audience.

Beilenson said Reagan had vio-
lated. the Intelligence Oversight
Act by failing to inform House
and Senate leaders of the ‘covert
activities. He said congressional
advice and input would have
helped him ”avoid terrible blun-
ders like this one."

Nizar Hamdoon, Iraqi ambas-
sador to the United States, said he
did not think the Reagan adminis-

tration could have been in con- '

tact’ with Iranian moderates
without the knowledge ofrthe
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

”I really feel that this Contact l

was maintained with the govern-
ment of Iran. ‘I don't see how this
thing could have been run for 18
months without the approval of
Khomeini. Khomeini is still in
control there,” Hamdoon told in-
terviewer John McLaughlin on
the syndicated television show
One on One, taped Friday night.

Hamdoon said the U.S. weap-
ons would not make itpossible
for Iran to win the war but would
prolong it and give Iran a psycho-
logical advantage.: V  “  ‘ .

BEFORE THE NAME GOES ON '

Pizza or Pekin

By Jim Urban
Editor-in-Chief

”WelI, I have heard it is really
good, but I never tried it.”

The topic is Chinese food, and
the quote above is a usual
response made by the typical Pitt
student when asked about
Chinese food.

Some students are pro-
grammed to pick up the phone
and call the nearest pizza place.
After all, it fills you up, and they
deliver it right to you.

That may change in the near
future.

The reason is Genghis Cones,
one of Pittsburgh's newest
Chinese restaurants located on
the corner of Penn and S. Aiken
in Shadyside. Although only ap-
proximately a year old, Genghis
Cones is establishing itself among
the elite of Chinese restaurants in
the city, and the pizza places are
feeling it already.

Genghis Cones serves only
take-out food and will deliver (as
long as the order is worth over

  8

Students can opt for Chinese food

$10) to your doorstep within 45
minutes as well.

This setup enables owners
Dave LaBelle, Jimmy Tsang and
Charlie Sze, who doubles as head
chef, to serve quality food, while
keeping the price list modest at
the same time.

For instance, if you like duck in
the Peking style, you can grab a
whole one for $15 or a half for
$8. It tends to be a little bit more
tasty than tomato sauce and
cheese on a piece of cardboard.

Most Chinese restaurants re-
quire a day's notice to prepare
Peking duck. "Genghis Cones can
have it to you in 15 minutes.

. ”The concept, when_Genghis
Cones originated, was to be able
to offer quality, cooked food in a
short period of time,” LaBelle
said.

The menu at Genghis Cones»
only begins with Peking duck. If ,

duck is too ”fowl’f for you, then

why not try some beef, like

maybe some ribs.
They are available in several
forms. There are barbecued ribs

available in both small or large _

portions from $4.25 to $12.50,
baby back ribs (a whole rack for‘
$7.95), or a house specialty —
Korean short ribs.

Eight different chicken dishes
(at $5.50 each) are available, but
the cashew chicken may be the
tastiest.

One can also choose from
seven types of beef ($5.50 each),
seven types of pork ( 5.50 each)
or eight types of shrimp ($7.25

If you're sitting in your office
with lunchtime approaching fast,
it might not be a bad idea to try
one of Genghis Cones’ lunch
boxes.

' For only $3.50, you receive a
generous portion of a menu en-
tree, plus rice, half an egg roll,
fried wonton and a chicken wing.
It's called lunch, but it resembles

THE Pl'lT NEWS, Monday, November 24, 1986

instead of old stand—by

dinner because there is a lot of
food to eat.

Again, cashew chicken is good,
but hot and spicy chicken is not
far behind in the lunch box
section.

By the time you are done, no
matter how stuffed you are, you
must make room for one more
item, the spinach and mozzarel-
la egg roll. Popeye would be in
heaven.

' When the establishment
opened, ice.cream was available,
but not anymore. It seems the in-
creased demand for Chinese food
from Genghis Cones bumped the
ice cream out. It was included
originally as an added draw. The
draw turned out to be unneces-
sary, however. '

”We didn't think we would be
as successful as we have been,”
Labelle admitted. ”We opened it
and expected to do a tenth of the
business we are doing.”

LaBelle and his partners are not
going to rest on their laurels
either. The trio plans on adding
another site in the near future,

When that site opens, ice cream

”We just want to give people

By Christopher Sepesy

Assistant Sports Editor

, The Panther football season has
come to an end, with a total sea-
son record of 5-5-1. Saturday's
expected loss to -No. 2 ranked
arch-rival Penn State seemed to
exemplify the problems which
the Pitt squads have _ been
plagued with the entire season.

0 ”We got beat by a good foot-
ball team who played very well,”
said Head Coach Mike Gottfried.
’.’On our side, l’m pleased with
some aspects and not pleased

with others. l’m not pleased with,

the special .teams early in the
game. But we played hard, and
l’m happy with, some of their
‘ efforts.” _ 5 ’

Kickoff

By John Enright

Sports Editor

One aspect of a football game
that people often overlook is the

' play of the special teams.

The kicking game, along with
the performance of the punt and
kickoff coverage teams, can often
play an integral part in a game.

Just ask the Pitt Panthers.

Missed field goals cost Pitt the

_ Maryland game, and a fumbled

snap on a punt was detrimental
to the Panthers against North
Carolina State. , _ _

And .heck, Pitt would have

' been down only 7-3 to Miami at

the half if it were.n’t for a late
second—quarter 2 Hurricane punt
return for a touchdown.

So what hurt the'Panthers most
in Saturday's 34-14 loss to the

second-ranked Penn State Nitta- A

ny Lions at Beaver Stadium, you
may ask? 4

A 91-yard kickoff return for a
touchdown by sophomore run-
ning back Blair Thomas, of
course.

Pitt had just taken a 7-3 -first-
quarter lead over the Lions on a
1-yard touchdown run by sopho-
more Craig ”lronhead” Heyward.
The score capped what may have
been Pitt's most impressive
touchdown drive of the season.
Taking the ball on their own
20-yard line, the Panthers drove
80 yards in nineplays. Pittjunior
quarterback Joe Felitsky was
three for three passing on the
drive, including a 29-yard com-
pletion to Heyward which set up
his touchdown. .

So when the Panthers lined u

L for the kickoff, their confidence

was running high. It appeared
they were going to give Penn
State all they could handle, all
day long. ,
Enter Blair Thomas. Taking th
ensuing kickoff on the left hash
mark at the 9-yard 'line, Thomas
ran toward the right side of the

‘S field, received a few key blocks

at the 20, stutter-stepped by a Pitt

defender at the 25,_ and was off »

to the races.

Penn State 10, Pitt 7. But more-.

importantly,. Pitt was devastated ~

emotionally. ' .-

”The turning point had» to be
‘that touchdown,” said Pitt Coach
Mike._‘Gottfried. ‘

”That really hurt us," said
Felitsky.

”We score a touchdown, kick
off the ball, and they score right
away,” said Pitt wide receiver
Keith Tinsley. ”Boom! They took
our seven points back just like
that.” ,

With the Panthers’ emotions in
an uproar, the Lions tacked on a

. touchdown in‘the second quart-

er on a 26-yard run by DJ‘.
Dozier to extend their lead to
17-7, and that's when things got
out of hand. '

Pitt defensive back Quintin
Jones gave Dozier an extra shove
after he was a good five yards into

\-

the end zone. A fight ensued, and . .

off—setting penalties were as-’

sessed. The incident was the first i

of three major fights during the A 

game, the last of which occurred
on the Panther sideline late in the
fourth quarter.

_ Obviously, neither coach was

pleased with the way the game '

got out of hand. But while Gott-
fried would not say much about
the fighting, Penn State coach Joe
Paterno did. ’’I’m not going to

blame anyone,” said Paterno,’

”but I think the officials may have
let the game get out of hand.”
Pitt players had a lot to say.
”We’re out there to play football,
not have a street fight,” said Pan-
therdefensive lineman Anthony
Siragusa. ”Guys on both sides
have to realize that. We're here
to play a game.-We're not here

' to kill each other.” .

Tinsley took a much less seri-
ous view of the incidents. ’’It [the

have a long way to go.
Whenever the ground rush was
in action, Felitsky seemed in per-
fect control, executing the hand-
offs to either Gladman or Hey-
ward. But in his passing game, he
seemed to be making too many
wild throws. Although his pass-
ing record was acceptable (11
completed passes in 24 attempts
for 124 yards),' he really needs to
work. on accuracy. .
Genilla was brought into the
"game in the last part of the third
quarter-, after Felitsky was taken
out because of a‘ bruised back,
and_remained in the game until

its end, His record of five com- ‘

pleted passeslin nine attempts for
49 yards was also only half-rate
for someone of his potential; like
Felitsky, his accuracy needs a lot
of work.. ' ,  .

0 Because of the Lions’ ‘strong

defense, freshman punter "John .
, .R,asp.saw-a lot of play .in'-fSatur-

     

day's game. He averaged 36.4 in
12 attempts for 437 yards. He

should prove valuable to the Pan-'

thers in future seasons.

0 The turningpoint in the game .

for the Panthers seemed to be the
91-yard touchdown return by

1.

Lions’ tailback Blair Thomas after‘ a

the Panthers had just scored. *

”That had to be our turning V‘

would be better on special teams ,

Gottfried attributes

gple have to-fill in.” P *3 .

Finally, the Pitt football season ‘

is over. On Saturday afternoon,

the Panthers concluded their sec

ond straight 5-5-1 season with a
humiliating 34-14 loss to the
second-ranked Penn State Nitta-
ny Lions.

The game showed the tre-
mendousthe disparity between
these two major college football

“programs.

The Nittany Lions embarrassed

Pitt for the second consecutive
season. Last year, Penn State
came to Pitt Stadium and blasted
the Panthers 31-0. On Saturday,
they dogged Pitt even worse, to-
tally dominating the game after
the first quarter. And, were it not
for an82-yard interception return
for a touchdown by Pitt free safe-
-ty Troy Washington, the final
score would have been worse, as
the Lions were driving for another
score at the time.

And if that isn’t enough to
show that Pitt's program is clear-
ly inferior to Penn State's, then
consider this. While Penn State
will play for the national cham-
pionship for the second consecu-
tive year, the Panthers will sit and
watch the post-season bowl
games for the third straight
season. '

Enough said. Let's face it, right
now Pitt has a mediocre football
program.

It is a sad state of affairs here.‘

After two disappointing seasons
‘under Foge Fazio, the Panthers
axed him and brought in Mike
Gottfried from Kansas last De-
cember. Hopes ran high that,

with talented players such as
Tony Woods, Randy Dixon, John
Congemi, Charles Gladman and
Craig Heyward, plus a new up-
beat team attitude, Gottfried
would bring respectability back
to the Pitt program this year. A
bowl game was the ultimate goal.

And while that was not to be
had, the Panthers did have their
chance, entering the Syracuse
game with a 4-2-1 record‘ and
minor bowl scouts watching. But
Congemi went down in that crit-
ical 24-20,|oss to the Orangemen
and was lost for the rest of the

season. As Congemi went, so 4'

went the Panthers. When he was
lost for the last three games of the
season, the Pitt team keeled over
and died. A

The Panthers lost two of their
last three games, and while those
losses came at the hands of No.
1 ranked Miami and Penn State,

Pitt let those two schools walk all

over us —- something that
shouldn't have happened.

You see, the Panthers are ailing
from more than a lack of talent."
Pitt's problem is far more drastic
because it is something that can't
be remedied by teaching a
player.

The’ Panthers simply don't
know how to win. They don't
know how to do the little things
to pull out a victory. .

They proved that this year in
losses to Maryland, Syracuse and
Temple and in a tie with North
Carolina State. In each of those
games, one big play by the Pan-
thers would have been enough to

pull out a win. That one big play
never came. And in each of those
four games, Pitt was presented by
its opponent with some golden
opportunities. Capitalizing on
one of those opportunities was all
they needed to win. But they
never took advantage of_that.
Even in lopsided losses to Mi-
ami and Penn State, Pitt .wasn’t
clearly inferior in terms of talent.
Rather, they gave the Hurricanes
and the Lions too many chances.
Being an opportunistic team is a

key to success. And both Miami '

and Penn State pounced on ev-
ery mistake Pitt made, turning
what could have been two close
football games into routs.

But let's not get ahead of our-
selves. There still is a talent short-
age at Pitt. I insist that the
Panthers don't have top 20 talent
anymore.

Sure, there are some good play-
ers here. On offense, Craig Hey-

 

—_?

ward, John Congemi, Billy
Osborn, Mark Stepnoski and Ran-
dy Dixon are impressive perform-
ers game in and game out.

Meanwhile, Tony Woods, Jer-
ry Olsavsky, Steve Apke, Billy
Owens and Gary Richard are also
”gamers” on the defensive side.

But the game is played with 35,
40 or 50 players, not 10 as listed
above. .

These criticisms aren't intend-
ed for any particular player, but
Pitt fans need to face facts before
they start criticizing Gottfried for
not winning more games this
year. . .

For starters, the___Panthers don't
have any tight ends, and, besides
Osborn, they don't have any con-
sistent receivers. The number of
dropped passes this year had’ to
exceed 50. .

Meanwhile, the offensive line

play this season wasnft anywhere ‘

near where it has been in previ-
ous years; Why? Well, it's not the
players, but rather the situation
they are in. All of Pitt's offensive
linemen concentrated primarily
on run-blocking last year as run-
ning back Charles Gladman ran
for over 1,000 yards. But Gott-
fried came in, and Pitt started
throwing the ball 35-40 times a
game. This was a big adjustment
for the linemen —- an adjustment
that takes more than one season
. to get used to.

_ Defensively, Pitt doesn't have
as many problems, but I still
question their ability to produce
in critical situations.

know why the Panthers have
problems, look no further than
their depth chart because you
will not see anything.

I understand that every football
player a school recruits isn't go-
ing to pan out and be a contribu-
tor, but the situation here is
ridiculous. There's entirely too
much dead weight on the Panther
roster.

Naturally, I feel the talent lev-
el at Pitt is greatly overstated.
Gottfried has to go out and
recruit, recruit, recruit. Once he
finds some talented players with
clear consciences, who have not
suffered the ill effects of losing

’ football game after football game

in which Pitt outplays the other
team, then the Panther football
program will be on its way back
to respectability.

. But while Gottfried appears to
be a better sideline coach than

- his predecessor Fazio, this is the

first season he ‘will have a real
chance to show how he can
recruit because he came in so late

fighting] is just indicative of two »

teams in the same state playing in

a big rivalry,” said Tinsley. ”We ‘

both want to prove who is the
beast of the East.”

.On this day, that was obvious. .

Pitt, still in a state of shock over
Thomas’ return, couldn't muster
any offensive firepower the rest
‘of the day. The only scoring op-
portunity the Panthers had was
late in the second quarter when
they drove to the Penn State 31.
But Heyward dropped a pass,
and Lions’ defensive back Mar-
ques Henderson knocked down
a pass intended for Billy Osborn.
Freshman kicker Jeff VanHorne
came on to attempt a 45-yard
field goal, but it fell short.
Despite being down only 17-7
at halftime, Pitt's chances for a
comeback were slim. in the sec-
ond half, Penn State turned the

' game intoa rout. The Lions’ Mas-

simo Manca kicked a 35-yard
field goal early in the third quart-
er after Penn State had intercept-
ed a Felitsky pass at the Pitt 17.

Then Matt Knizner replaced an
injured John Shaffer (dislocated
finger) at quarterback. Knizner

soon made his presence known,’

throwing a perfect pass to Eric
Hamilton for an 82-yard touch-
down pass. Hamilton beatQuin—
tin Jones on the play, who didn't
help matters by slipping seconds
before Hamilton caught the ball
near the ‘Panther 40. .

I The Lions added a fourth quart-_

, er touchdown run by Thomas,

and minutes later Pitt closed out
the scoring with an 82-yard inter-
ception return by Troy <Wash-
ington.

up against Miami. That is, if the

The Lady Panthers defeated.Providence 3-1/to win the Big East title.

By Bill Schoo.ley

For The Pitt News

Everyone knew it would come
down to this: Pitt vs. Providence
for the Big East Women's Volley-
ball Charnpionship.

So, when the Lady Panthers

Q breezed through the preliminary

rounds without dropping a‘ game
to Seton Hall in the quarterfinals
or to Syracuse in the semi-finals,

and Providence "did the same

against Connecticut and George-
town, no one was surprised.

After all, these two have been
battling it out for supremacy for
the past five years; Pitt won in '83
and '85 and Providence in '82
and "84. Once again the battle

lines were drawn for the top two

seeds, the stakes being an auto-
matic NCAA tournament bid.

Last year the scenario was simi-
lar. Pitt entered the-tournament
seeded No. 1 and lost to No. 2

. ‘Providence-in the last game of the

best _of five" final. That loss‘ may

   

have sealed Providencefs fate in
this year's tournament.

”The most important factor in
the tournament was our determi-
nation to improve after finishing
second lastyear,” said Pitt coach
Shelton Collier. ”We had to live
with that second—place finish for
365 days last year.iSo when we

got our chance to play Provi-

dence, ~ we were ready.”

Pitt defeated Providence three
games to one for the Big East ti-
tle and the _trip to the NCAAs.
And they did it very con-
vincingly. _ -

In the first game, strong serves

and some excellent play at the I

middle hitting spots from Nora
Mulvihill and Noreen Coughlin
catapulted Pitt to a 15-6 win.

In the second game, Provi-
dence played‘ outstanding
defense, picking up most every-
thing Pitt spiked at them, and

Women swimmers dominate Villanova 

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writer

The Pitt women's swim team
prevailed over the Villanova
Wildcats this past weekend by a
wide 169-99 margin.

Villanova is traditionally one of
the toughest teams Pitt faces in
the Big East during the season. It
is certainly encouraging for Pitt to
prevail so easily over such a good
team this early in the season.

One factor that made the wom-
en's meet a little more exciting
was that the Villanova team ta-
pered for the meet. This is some-
thing that the Pitt squad was not
expecting."

Staff Writer

The swim meet against Villano-
va this past weekend had special
significance for the Pitt men's
swim team. Pitt was defeated last
year by the Wildcats 64-49 in a
disappointing meet.

The Panthers didn't take the
loss lightly though, and they have
remembered it many-times while
training early this fall. This year

the Panthers’ goal was to atleast ‘ '

make it a close meet.

Even though the physical tap-

' pering put Villanova at a definite

advantage in the water, the Pitt
women rose to the occasion..
Outstanding performances
were delivered by the majority of
Pitt swimmers, as they won 14 of
16 events. Two record-setting
times were set by freshman San-

dy Albright and senior. Sue‘

Hickman.

Albright broke a school record
in the 100-yard backstroke, set
back in 1980 by Olympic swim-
mer and _Pitt graduate Susan
Heon. Albright’s record-breaking
time was 59.52. Albright also had
a first-place finish in the 200-yard

men's team has

But Pitt did more than that as
they blew Villanova right out of
the water in a 131-84 upset.

' Pitt men's swimming coach
Fred Lewis attributes the win
mostly to the leadership of the
seniors. .

"The seniors rose to the occa-
sion swimming their best times,”
said Lewis. "They provided fan-
tastic leadership in the meet.
They provided a good example
for the other kids to follow.'’.

One factor that makes the up-
set so sweet for Pitt is the fact that

Senior co-captain Hickman had
an outstanding day and was the
first on Pitt's team this year to
qualify for the NCAA Champion-
ships. Hickman qualified in the
50-yard freestyle with a time of
23.54. Hickman also took first
place in the 100—yard freestyle
with a time of 52.01.

Other note-worthy perform-
ances of the day came from Pitt

senior cocaptain Jodi O'Neil,

who took first—place finishes in
both the 100- and 200-yard
breast stroke events and also in
the 400—yard Individual Medley.

the Vil|anova_team was shaved
and tapered for the meet, while
the Panthers weren't. What Pitt
did not have in first-place finish-

‘es, they made up for in depth.

1 Panther senior Tom Shaulinski
was fired.-up for the meet and
gave first-place performances in

the 100- and 200-yard freestyle,

events with times of 1:40.06 and
1:46.02. , ,

"Losing last year made the
meet special forjus to win this
year. We've been talking about it
since September,” said Shaulin-

Meanwhile, junior Judy Haugh-
ton swam well, placing first in the
100- and 200-yard butterfly
events.

Pitt sophomore Tricia Rickert,
who took first place in the
200-yard freestyle with a time of
1:55.60, was pleased with the
results of the meet. "This meet
was beneficial because it has
shown us exactly where we are
atand what we still have to work
on,” said Rickert. ’_'Villanova
provided the toughest races I've
had all year.” '2

The Pitt women were also
dominant in the diving competi-
tion, taking first through third

similar

ski after the meet.

Other memorable first-pl-ace 1‘

performances were delivered by
sophomore Mark Dombrowski,
who won the 200-yard breast
stroke with a time of‘ 2:09.53,
while junior Geoff Rife swam
away with a first-place finish in
the 1,000-yard freestyle with a

time of 9:56.01.

boards. On both ‘boards, first
place belonged to sophomore
Margie Paulick. Second and third
places were filled by juniors Shel-
ly Bowser and Cathy McDonald.

"We had our best meet of the
season so far against Villanova.
This win sets us up nicely for the
double meet against Penn State
and West Virginia,” commented
Pitt women's coach David Belo-
wich. ‘'1 am extremely‘ happy
with the way everyone swam.
The most important thing was
that we won in close races and
swam strong in all aspects of the
race.”

place finishes. Williams’ winning
time in the 200-yard individual
medley was 1:57.07, and he
finished with 1:56.06 in the
200-yard butterfly.

"The team really pulled
together against Villanova. It
shows our strength beating a
shaved team like that,” said Wil-
liams. "We, can't dwell on this
win, though; we have to look
ahead and prepare, for an even
tougher challenge, WVU."

Pitt senior Jack Shuten domi-
nated the diving competition,
winning both the 1- and 3-meter
boards.

Coach Lewis was both sur- ‘

prised and pleased with the way
his team performed.

had a chance to win, but I never

margin," said Lewis. "The seniors
really got the team fired— up. We
had nothing to lose and every-
thing to gain."

..Pitt’s Blue-Gold intrasqluadl
gameat Rochester High School

- on Saturday night was more than
. your average intrasquad game.

For Panther sophomore walk-
on Jon Luther, it was a homecom-

ing game. Luther played high '

school basketball at Rochester,
and the -ex-Ram hadia memora-
ble evening, to say the least. A gi-
ant "Welcome Home"banner
greeted him as the Panther play-
ers escorted Luther inside the
gymnasium. As expected, many
of Luther's friends and family
were there to cheer him on;
Needless to sa-y, he wasa bit ner-
vous, but he had a good
homecoming game, finishing
with eight points. "Tonight was
memorable,” said Luther. ’’It felt
good to come home and play in
front of the home folks. I really
wasn't nervous, but I did want to
play well in front of my friends

' and family.

The rest of the Pitt team en-
joyed themselves as well, signing
many autographs and takingpic-.
tures with little children. After a

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 24, 1986

Better late than never.

By Robert Jordan

Sta ff Writer .

OK basketball fans, let's talk
about a real sport, profession-
al basketball. The game that
showcases the best in athletic
speed, strength and grace. This
is where the real action is.

Although the season is al-
ready a couple of weeks old,
a preseason prediction
column is appropriate. Can
Boston repeat as NBA cham-
pions or will the up-and-
coming Houston Rockets top-
ple them from their lofty
perch? Will the 76ers’ block-
buster, off—season trade (and
Charles Barkley) be enough to

send Dr. J away with another

title? .
What about the deposed

Lakers? Can they rekindle their

championship ”magic”? Will

the acquisition of Jack Sikma I

finally put the Bucks in the

J ”promised” land?

Here are thegpredictions,

based upon the experts’ picks I

for the 1986-87 season:

iv Atlantic Division *
1. Boston
2. Philadelphia
3. Washington

'4. New Jersey
5. New York

The C_e_ltics, although taking

plenty of Geritol throughout '

the season, should hold on
and win the division once
again. Philadelphia has made
some very good deals during
the off-season, especially draft-
ing David Wingate, but they
will come up just a-bit short.
Moses is on ‘a mission in
Washington and will have
plenty of help from all-star
gunner Jeff Malone, but they
won't catch the big boys."
Pearl Washington will inject
some life into the Nets and
Buck Williams will always be
Buck Williams, but they need
a healthy Doctor-of-Dunk Dar-

ryl Dawkins to push the field.
That leaves the NBA’s
M*A*S*H unit, the Knicks, in
the cellar. It's a shame, too, be-
cause when healthy, this team
can do some damage.

1' Central Division ir
. Milwaukee

. Atlanta

. Detroit

. Indiana

Chicago

. Cleveland

o*~_u1.t>wr~.>-—-

Once again, the Bucks will
take the Central Division, but
it will no longer be a cake-
walk. Besides the Rockets, the
Hawks have the most im-

proved team in the league. _

Led by .jam-masters Domi-
nique Wilkins and Spud Webb
— these guys are for real. The
Bucks can't afford to fall
asleep, for if they do, the

Hawks will soar. Meanwhile, ..

in the Motor City, the Pistons
will still have Isaiah Thomas,
Mr. Shake-n-Bake, dazzling
enemy defenses, but need
more beefmeat up front to
challenge. .

The best new team goes to
Indiana. New forward Chuck
Person, along with new coach
Jack Ramsey, can help the
team finally brush the second-
division dust off their Nikes. In
the Windy City, the biggest
story isn’t Michael Jordan, but
his new shoes. Still, even after
getting off to a great start, Air
Jordan and the Bulls will be
grounded by February, and a
cellar spot will be reserved for
them.

What about Cleveland, you
ask? Well, they'll need all of
Lenny Wilkins’ championship
magic of 1978 to escape the
dungeon. Look for the Cavs
and the Bulls to become room-
mates in the cellar.‘

‘k Midwest Division tr
1. Houston
2. Dallas

3. Denver

4. Utah

5. San Antonio

6. Sacremento

Two factors can back up the
prediction of Houston as being
No. .1 — Akeem Olajuwon
and Ralph Sampson. Akeem is
a nightmare‘ to opposing
teams, and Ralph creates
hordes of problems for every-
one. Allyou Sampson critics
out there take note. If it wasn't
for him, there would be no
such thing as the ”Twin Tow-
ers,” which every team in the
league is trying tocopy. Any-
Way, when all is said and
done, the Rockets will be the
teamto beat in the West. (Are
you listening, LA?). V

At one time, Houston's PHI
SLAMA JAMA was the tallest’
fraternity in Texas. Now that
distinction belongs to that
”other” city in Texas: Dallas.
Sporting six players over 6-9
and four over 7-0, the Maver-
icks have plenty of size. Ad-
ding the deadly Rolando
Blackman and the explosive
Mark Aguirre, the Mavs will
jump over Denver and nestle.
into second place.

Denver coach Doug Moe
has an interesting offensive

philosophy — ”If. we don't
shoot in 10 seconds, we've
blown an assignment.”

(Sounds like the offense they
run at Trees Hall.) Neverthe-
less, the Nuggets are still the
NBA’s toughest team above
sea level, and, led by Alex En-

Walk-on

Continued from page 14
business and unveiled their new
style of play to the Rochester fans.

The Blue team easily defeated
the Gold 100-42. Junior swing-
man Demetreus Gore led all
scorers with 31 points, while for-
ward Jerome Lane continued to
play well, scoring'27 points. The
starting team of Gore, Lane,

glish,
tough.

Utah, San Antonio and
Sacremento will finish in that
order respectively, and given
the weak Pacific Division,
they'll make the playoffs.
However, they won't advance
— believe it.

they should remain

~k Pacific Division ‘A’

. Los Angeles Lakers
Portland

. Golden State
Phoenix

. Los Angeles Clippers
. Seattle

o~u1:;>u.aru—-

The loud crash that was heard
around the league last May 21
was the end of "Purple Reign" in
the Western Conference.
However, the Lakers will still win
the division by Christmas and
cruise into the playoffs.

Led by the multi-talented and
ever-smiling Magic Johnson and
Co., the Lakers will still hoistthe
first-place flag in the fabulous Fo-
rum_. From.there, the teams go
downhill in talent, sort of like the
Pitt basketball team after the start-
ing five.

Portland is projected to finish
a distant second, and, led by
Clyde ”The' Glide” Drexler and
Kiki Vandeweghe, that prediction
should hold up. Third should go
to Golden State because the other

V teams arefighting over the cellar

spot

Phoenix needs to answer many
questions and overcome con-
troversy to shine again. The Clip-

guards Curtis Aiken and Mike
Goodson and Charles Smith
looked sharp and executed well.
The Blue missed very few shots
in the game and capitalized on
many turnovers by the ’Gold
team. Nevertheless, the evening
belonged to Luther. He played
well, and the Rochester fans gave
him a homecoming reception

.3

A look at the NBA

pers’ Elgin Baylor will have to. I

pull off some moves as skilled as
the ones he made during.his play-
ing days in order for his team to
rise.

Seattle, poor Seattle. Xavier
McDaniel is the only bright spot
in the rainy Northwest. This team
needs a lot of help and fast.

So, there you have it. Boston _

should hold off Milwaukee in the
East, while Houston will best the

Lakers in the West. Boston will.

defeat the Rockets because
Houston's sports teams have a
tendency to get to the finals, only
to lose, and that will keep Akeem

and company from wearing gold —

on their fingers this season.

that he won't forget for a_ long

PANTHER NOTES: Freshman
Rodney Brookin, Goodson and
