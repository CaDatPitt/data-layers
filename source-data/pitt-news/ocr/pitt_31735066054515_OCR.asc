After a two-year delay,
construction has begun on
th_e neglected Panther
Hollow Bridge in Schenley
Park, with the hope of
restoring it to its original
design.

“This bridge has been in
line for rehabilitation for a
number of years,” said
-Fred Reginella, the

engineering and construc-
tion. He said the project was
supposed to start in 1996,
but a legal issue brought
about by one of the contrac-
tors wound up in court and
delayed the process. In
April of this year, the city
got the green light to move
forward. _
A&L Construction Co.,
which restored the Schenley

Towers gym under construction

Erin Lindeman
For The Pltt News

With construction underway
for a new fitness center on the
ground floor of Tower A, the
University is forging ahead with
plans’ to make fitness equipment
more accessible to students on the
lower campus. A

The new facility is scheduled
to be completedvby mid-October
but will be available only to stu-
dents living in the Towers resi-
dence halls.

The University allotted
$150,000 in the 1999 budget to
build the new facility. But pur-
chasing new equipment and recon-
structing the area for the fitness
center are only two of the minor
difficulties in the process. Several
resident directors’ offices and a
conference room will have to be
moved from to another location.

Jennifer Stein, a Tower A resi-
dent, was ecstatic when she
learned of the center’s'opening.

“Now when I eat a bowl of
Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, I can
just go downstairs and work out,
instead ‘of having to go all the way
to Trees [Hall],” she said. V

The time it takes to get to the
fitness centers in Trees Hall,
Lothrop Hall and Bellefield Hall
is one of the major reasons that
Towers residents are not using the
gym facilities. Trees is farther

' than Bellefield, but some students

say the equipment in Trees is
nicer.

The Tower A gym will feature
a 12-station weight—lifting unit,
four treadmills, three stationary
bikes, and two step units. Jere
Gallagher, of Pitt’s physical edu-

,cation department, said many

For The Pltt News

For most of Pitt’s nontraditional stu-
dents, being a student is not their only
occupation. ,

Along with taking college classes,
many also have families to feed and clothe
as well as a full-time job. They’re termed
nontraditional because they are students
who go to college after several years in the
work force. Usually, they go to school in
order to begin a new career.

But though their schedules are hectic,
some students still manage to ﬁnd the time
to get involved on campus and offer ser-
vice to the University at large. _

Last Tuesday, the College of General
Studies unveiled a new way of recogniz-
ing nontraditional student leaders for their
work in and out of the classroom. .

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg led the
presented a large plaque to honor nontra-
ditional student leaders. The plaque fea-
tures the names of nontraditional students

who served on’ the CGS Student

A Government.

The CGS Student Government has
been active since the 1970s and has been
successful in developing special programs
for nontraditional students. It plans leader-
ship workshops and other career-building
activities.

CGS Student Government has also
worked closely with the University to
ensure that all special needs of nontradi-
tional students are met, making sure that
computing labs are accessible during the
summer months and that the University
allows for special library hours. CGS
Student Govemment’s goal is to make Pitt
a more comfortable place for students
who have families, full-time jobs or both.

Roberta Czamecki, CGS Student
Government president, said the plaque
was. a “shining jewel crown of recogni-
tion.” Czarnecki also mentioned the
importance of encouraging nontraditional

Carnegie, Phipps free with PiHi|D

Carrie Hagar 5
Staff Writer

First Pitt cut a deal with Port
Authority to allow students to travel
anywhere in Allegheny County by
bus just by showing a Pitt ID. Now
the University had further increased
the power of the mighty student ID
by reworking the . pact with the
Carnegie museums /‘and Phipps
Conservatory, allowing students free
entrance. ' '

In the past, students could get
passes to the Carnegie, but there were
a limited number available, accord-
ing to Pitt Arts coordinator Jen
Saffron. The museums used to print
only 4,000,000 passes, but they were
usually consumed by art and history
classes, and students didn’t get pass-
es if they weren’t aggressive. - V .

When Pitt Arts worked out th
plan with the museum to allow stu-
dents to use their ID cards for admis-
sion, it decided to include Phipps
Conservatory.

Now students can go to the
Carnegie Museum of Art, the
Carnegie Museum of Natural History
and Phipps Conservatory for free by
showing a validated card.

Student IDs will be checked at
the doors of these facilities with an
ID reader and must be valid, accord-
ing. to Saffron. She explained that the

deal is for all students, part-time and ’

fu1l—time, but is not for staff who take
classes.

policy,” she said. And the old passes
only included the Carnegie museums,
so the Pitt sponsors approached
Phipps about being part of the pro-
gram. , '

“Our goal is to make it easier and
more usable for everyone,” Saffron
said. “We are committed [to the idea]
that neighboring cultural resources
should be used to supplement our stu-
dents’ quality of life and overall edu-
cation. We will continue to create
opportunities such as this to beneﬁt
the overall student body.”

Saffron also explained that this
program was meant for all students,
not just those taking art classes.

“We were trying to work out [a
deal] for all students to go to muse-
ums.PThe museums are actually clos-
er to some students than their actual
classes,” she said.

Many students said they thought
that this program was a great idea,
and they thought it would create
more interest in the museums.

“It can definitely help interest,
and the more stuff you can use your
ID for, the better,” said Pitt junior
Tony Castle. “Students love free-
bies.”

Dan Greenwald, a sophomore,
said that he will definitely take
advantage of this opportunity now
that he knows about it.

“It’s a good way to get people to
visit more culturally entertaining
places,” he said.

Saffron also explained that in the

“It is‘ _a student—oriented . privi-,\future, this program could extend to

1ege,” she said.

This program is sponsored large-
ly by Pitt. Arts, but the Student
Government Board, the College of
General Studies, the Pitt Program
Council and the Graduate Business
Student Association are also spon-
sors, Saffron said.

“We felt an insufficient number
of passes were available, and we
wanted to create .a new admissions

more places. » 1
“We are currently [working] wit
30 to 40 artistic and cultural organi-
zations to extend to new places,” she
said.» “Through Pitt Arts, more arts
organizations are beginning to seri-
ously look at how to create innova-
tive programs and discounts that will
cater to our students’ needs, ultimate-

ly providing more benefits for our .

students.”

punish students for speech,” said Sylvia
Warner, a spokeswoman for McManus’ con-
gressional campaign. McManus is running
for the U.S. House of Representatives.

McManus introduced the bill because
she recognized free speech rights had been a
continuing issue, Wamer said.

M- ichigan State University doesn’t
enforce any speech codes, but the bill would
protect future decisions to prohibit speech,

gsaid Henry Silverman, president of the

Lansing branch of the American Civil
Liberties Union.

“This sounds very encouraging that this
kind of safeguard may be built into legisla-
tion,” he said

Jenny Matouka, former co-director of

the Alliance of Lesbian, Bi, Gay and_

Transgendered Students, agreed the bill
would beneﬁt college students.

“I think that the transient population at ’

MSU makes it hard to have a solidiﬁed
voice,” she said. “People want censorship
because they’re afraid. It’s not going to
change their ignorance. It’s just going to cen-
sor what they hear.’’ A .

MSU has expressed its views on the free
speech issue in the past. ‘

President M. Peter McPherson issued
statements in The State News in past years
stating his “strong beliefs in the First
Amendment of the Constitution.” The letter
emphasized “individual responsibility” and
the “spirit of [MSU’_s] core values.”

“Free speech. is fundamental to the
exchange of ideas; that is the academy,” said
Terry Denbow, vice president for university
relations. “Malice and a reckless disregard
for the truth is wrong.”

Lack of a speech code doesn’t" give peo-
ple the right to say anything that may hurt or
prohibit others from stating their views,
Denbow said.

‘This is an academic and intelligent
community, and we should be able to engage
in discussions and not have to worry about
having our speech or thoughts tempered,”
said _Nate Smith—Tyge, chairman of the
Associated Students of Michigan State
University student assembly. “If you don’t
protect offensive speech, then no speech is
protected.’’.

This isn’t the ﬁrst time the issue of free
speech on college campuses has surfaced.

In 1989, a speech code at the University
of Michigan resulted in 20 cases of white stu-
dents charging black students with offensive
speech. The code, which lasted 18 months,
was declared unconstitutional after a black
student was punished for saying “white

trash” in a conversation, said an ACLU Web‘

page.

Another case, published in the Chicago
Tribune on May 5, 1991, involved a
University of Connecticut student ordered to
move oﬁ campus because of a sign she post-
ed on her dorm room making fun of “prep-
pies,” “bimbos,” “men without chest hair”
and “homos.” After a federal lawsuit was
threatened, the student was allowed to move
back on campus and the university revised its
code of conduct. '

THE P111 NEws

BRIDGE

time when there weren’t many cars.
Now, when Panther Hollow Bridge
is considered by many to be a main
artery into and out of Squirrel Hill,
it needs lights for nighttime safety
and fences to prevent people from
throwing trash into the lake below.
Some of these added features dras-
tically alter the bridge’s character.

“The bridge almost pre-dates
electricity,” said Robert
Gangewere, editor of Carnegie
Magazine. “Now you need lights so
that drivers can see the road, so you
lose the old Victorian lights. I think
[the people who designed the reno-
vations] could have made better
decisions about the lighting, but
that’s all history now.”

However, Gangewere did say
that the city deserves credit for not
just tearing the bridge down to put
up a new one, a process that would
have been much less expensive.

Rehabilitation of the 615—foot
bridge, which is still open to pedes-
trians, is part of Mayor Tom

Murphy’s
Pittsburgh.

“It’s a temporary inconvenience
but a permanent improvement,”
said Alex Basara, the inspector in
charge of the city’s Department of
Engineering.

“Pedestrians were surprised, but
Pittsburgh’s a pretty resilient
town,” Bossart said. “Everybody’s
pretty ﬂexible, and people have
accepted it.”

One thing that won’t be chang-
ing is the name of the bridge.
Panther Hollow Bridge stands 120
feet above the ravine where pan-
thers supposedly once prowled. The
legend tells of bold frontiersmen
hunting the dangerous beasts in
what is now Panther Hollow. At
each end of the bridge stand four
bronze panthers, sculpted by
Giuseppi Moretti. Pitt keeps the
legend alive with the panther.mas—
cot. V

However, Gangewere disagrees
with the story. “That’s popular lore
of 100 years ago. It’s pretty unlike-

“It will be a great facility when

in the new facility. The electrical
system also needs’ to have work
done in order to accommodate the

inent, such as treadmills, according ‘

to Pitt spokesman Ken Service.
The Towers fitness center will
also differ from other facilities on

campus in that it will not be
equipped with free weights. The
reason for this is that the gym will
not be supervised. Instead, station-
ary equipment will be used because
it has a lower risk of injury, and
students can use the equipment
without partners.

Danielle Cohen, a freshman
who lives in the Towers, works out
at a campus fitness center three or
four times a week.

“Most likely that number will
increase,” she said, “and I’ll work
out for longer  periods of time.
Because it will be so close, I won’t

alleged rapist and his fraternity, Sigma Phi
Epsilon.

“I want schools to take responsibility and
concern for their students,” Smithers said.
“Especially when they advertise the advan-
tages of Greek life but don’t monitor fraterni-
ties.” I
The lawsuit comes after ‘a year of settle-
ment negotiations between Smithers and BU
fell through. Originally, she sought $3 million
from the parties, but BU oﬂicials claim she
lowered that demand to $450,000. Smithers
said BU offered her $50,000 if she agreed not
to tell her story. Neither party would confirm
the other’s account.

Smithers said she had the choice to ﬁle the
suit as “Jane Doe,” but chose to use her name
in her statement of demands and in the media
to humanize her story.

“I decided it was important enough to

i have a personal message stand out so people

would really notice it,” Smithers said.

Sigma Phi Epsilon is unrecognized by the
BU administration, and BU Associate Vice
President and Dean of Students Herbert Ross
said Lambda Chi Alpha and Chi Phi, where
Smithers was served alcohol at rush parties
that evening, also were unrecognized by the
university at the time.

“I had concerns with the way the universi-
ty polices fraternities,” Smithers said. “I don’t
think there is a warning system out there for.

' freshmen.”

She said the confusion about which frater-
nities are recognized by the BU administration
shows the lack of control the university has
over its Greek-letter system.

“They can’t even tell a few people the cor-
rect information,” Sinithers said of the con-
ﬂicting reports in the media about Lambda Chi
Alpha and Chi Phi’s status.

“'I'here’s only so much [the university] can
do,” Ross said. “The No. 1 key thing is that if
you have been drinking, you put yourself at
risk.”

Smithers said she is ﬁling the suit because
she wants to encourage BU to take a proactive
role in protecting students and warning them
of the dangers fraternities represent.

“If BU had sent out a warning saying
these fraternities were ‘off campus,’ maybe
when the guy told me which one he was in and
invited me into his house, I wouldn’t have
done that,” Smithers said

Smithers said BU also is responsible
because it did not provide adequate services to
keep her safe. BU’s escort service stopped run-
ning at 1 a.m., she said.

Smithers claims the two fraternities where
she drank earlier in the evening also are par-
tially responsible for the assault because they
served her alcohol without asking for age ID.
She was 17 at the time of the alleged assault.

“We educate our members that in any
event they hold, they are responsible for the
actions that occur afterwards,” said Jason

I Pearce, director of communications for the

Lambda- Chi Alpha International Fraternity. .

TV news: mostly fluff and
little substance

g Instead of giving viewers break-

ing news, whetlrer it’s domestic or

international, television news is
dedicated to ﬁlling its air time with
worthless ﬂuff feature stories, end-
less dimwitted debate on tired top-

ics, and in-depth analyses of celebri-

ty deaths. _

It’s about time this pandering to
the lowest common denominator
stops. By dumbing down and plac-

1 ing more emphasis on entertain-

ment, TV news is perpetuating the
ignorance of the generation it says is
not watching enough news in the
ﬁrst place.

The biggest culprits are the
cable news networks, particularly
CNN and MSNBC. The icing on
CNN’s ratings—obsessed cake is the
addition of “CNN Newsstand —
Entertainment Weekly” to its
Wednesday night prime-time line-
up, bringing viewers movie and
celebrity news that can be just as
easily found on CNN’s “Showbiz
Today” or E!’s “E! News Daily.”
Instead, CNN ’s most informative

program, “Worldview” (which has
, also suffered in the quality depart-
' ‘ ment recently) is shown at 6 p.m.,

an inconvenient time for most peo-
ple. '

CNN is also dedicated to bring-
ing in more talk shows. “Crossﬁre,”
“Larry King Live” and “Burden of
Proof.’ are just three, with the same

inept, half-witted hosts and shame-
lessly opportunistic guests kicking
around the same dead topics (the
Clinton scandal, JonBenet Ramsey,
etc.). As Jon. Katz said in the Sept.
17 issue of Rolling Stone magazine,
“Desperate for talking heads, cable
has spawned an industry of sound-
bite-spitting, ideological mercenar-
ies. Fanatics and lobbyists are all
just a limo ride away from their
nearest cable studio.”

There was a day when CNN
provided strong coverage (the Gulf
War, the Bosnian crisis, the civil war
in Chechnya), and we would like to
see a return to that. The current
Headline News charmel’s half—hour
is so predictable in its format, with
features, weather and sports taking
up. more time than hard news, with
no in-depth reporting (hence the
charmel’s name). However, credit
must be given for its coverage of
Russia’s current ﬁnancial, social
and political woes.

More and more people are tum-
ing to the Web for their hard news,
with Reuters’ , the Associated Press’
and the New York Times’ sites lead-
ing the way in providing interesting,
thought-provoking stories.

For now, it seems CNN is more
interested in how the British public
is coping with Lady Diana
Spencer’s death —— one year after
the event.

Ignore the siren coll of:

Earlier this summer, I read a news story
detailing how hostile the American public is
toward economic aid for foreign countries, I
remembered a quotation I had read years before
from a Depression-era U.S. Senator named
Arthur Vandenberg. One of the champions of
the Old Guard isolationist wing of the
Republican Party, Vandenberg was in I.ondon
during the closing days of World War II when he
witnessed a German rocket-bomb attack on the
city. Looking at the bombs in amazement, he
turned to a friend and remarked, ‘How can there
be immunity or isolation when men can devise
weapons like that?” Returning to the United
States, Vandenberg became an ardent interna-
tionalist and enabled President Han'y Truman to
create such legacies as the Marshall Plan and
NATO.

Disturbirrgly, the lessons learned 50 years
ago by Vandenberg have largely been forgotten
by the American public today. Fed up with what
they believe are elitist politicians '
giving most of their tax money to
“rat holes” overseas, the American
people have perhaps never been
more open to the siren call of isola-
tionism as they are now. Polls show

   

l

that foreign affairs generally ranks last among.

issues Americans care about. In 1996 alone, just

I 4 percent of voters considered foreign policy the

most important political issue.

Politicians feel the pull of isolationism as
well. Increasingly beholden to contributions
from the protectionists in organized labor, the

. Democratic Party is no longer the bulwark of

interrrationalism it once was. Likewise, ﬂre
Republican Party is increasingly drifting back to
its anti-trade, isolationist roots. Congress is
increasingly being ﬁlled by members whose
focus on domestic policy issues never wavers.
Their understanding of the complexities of for-
eign alfairs is limited at best. One GOP con-
gressman closed off a 1996 brieﬁng by State
Department oﬂicials by asking them what the
capital of Africa was. This is unfortunate, for the
potential costs of this drift back to isolationisrn
are immense.

Recently Germany, France, and Japan have
all supplanted the United States as the leading
fdieign aid donors in the world. The United
States spends approximately 0.9 percent of its
budget on foreign aid. France, in contrast,

, spends more than 3 percent of its budget on for-

eign aid. Excepting Egypt and Israel, which
receive 36 percent of the State Departrnent’s
Foreign Operations budget, no country gets any

appreciable amount of aid from the United
States. Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell
remarked with disgust that further cuts in the for-
eign aid budget would give the United States in’
the next century “as visible and viable _an inter-

national role as Ghana.”
According to a 1996 article in Tune maga-

zine, the United States spends more money A

expanding Route 66 into Washington D.C. than
it does supporting democracy in Russia Which
ought to be a more important priority for
America —- expanding a road’ so that com-
muters can get to work a few minutes early or
preserving democracy and banishing the possi-
bility of a second Cold War?

Foreign aid has a tangible effect on emerg-
ing econornies. “If we’re not able to move in to
help with the nuts and bolts of democracy and
help strengthen civil society, then new democra-
cies are more likely to'fail in the early days,”
noted an administrator for the Agency for
International Development in refer-
ence to a CIA study which showed
that foreign aid helps emerging
nations survive economic hardship.
Economic aid ‘helps the United
States foster closer ties with these
countries and opens the door to a win-win situa-
tion for the American people. By improving the
standard of living for the peoples of the Third
World, the United States can help to make the
world a safer place. ' L ’

Do we continue to support a strong and
vibrant foreign policy centered around econom-
ic assistance? Or do we retreat and abandon our
position as the superpower of the world?
Vlrrthout economic aid and a trade policy, the
United States has few, if any, bargaining chips to
play" in the world of international diplomacy.
\Vrthout bargaining chips, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright might as well ﬂy from cap-

italtocapitalaskingtlrewarringnationsofthe

world to “play nice.” VV1thout aid, the United
States may ﬁnd that its only viable option in the
event of a foreign crisis is to send in the 
Must American soldiers pay the ultimate price
because we were chintzy with our money?

In the end, the lesson Sen. Vandenberg
learned in London during World War H is what
we Americans must all bear in mind In a world
that is increasingly without borders, isolationism
has no place in American foreign policy.
Michael Berquist wants to encourage everyone

to remember that there is a world outsicie of

Just say no to
Nabisco

I feel that The Pitt News misun-
derstands the purpose of the ongo-
ing boycott of Nabisco and R. J.
Reynolds products (“A boycott not
worth dunking in milk,” Sept. 3 edi-
torial).

If and when Nabisco ‘leaves
Pittsburgh, it will leave 348 dedi-
cated and fairly compensated bread-
winners from the East Liberty plant
unable to support their families.
Meanwhile, business from Nabisco
will create a similar number of jobs
in an independent, sweatshop—like
plant in Ohio. In effect, Nabisco

"will replace over 300 living-wage

jobs with poverty-level jobs in a
Dickensian factory where workers
presently complain that plant opera-A
tors do not even allow them to stop
working long enough to use the
restrooms.

Nabisco currently plans to use
similar tactics in closing four other

plants — including one in
Philadelphia. Even if the boycott
fails in its efforts to keep jobs in
our community and others, it will
succeed in showing companies like
Nabisco that brazenly ignoring the
public’s values will cost them sev-

eral times more than the profit_

potentially made by plunging their
employees into poverty.

I might add that while everyone
is pleased to see jobs ﬂowing into
the region, the jobs at the Nabisco
plant provide people with the means
to support their families. I’m sure
that many Pitt students have a first-
hand understanding that three jobs

are better than one only ‘if they’re

not all yours.

LETTERS  

Columnist gives
pro-lifers bad
0 reputation

I am writing in response to the arti-
cle published on Sept. 3 entitled
“Where there’s a choice, there’s a way.”

Articles such as this give pro-lifers
a bad reputation, and I am sick of this
deceptive attack on the pro-life move-
ment. It is unfair to generalize pro-lifers
as supporting clinic bombings, capital
punishment, excessive military spend-
ing and other far-from-the-point, dis-
tracting issues.

For more than years now, the abor-
tion industry has made billions of dol-
lars from American women while con-
tending that its only interest is protect-
ing. and helping women who are facing
unwanted pregnancies. But other than
abortions, what choices is the industry

offering? Let’s say a woman goes into -*

one of these abortion mills with no

money, no one to -help her, and no »

home, but she has no intention of hav-
ing an abortion. What services will be
provided to her? The answer is
absolutely none.

There are more people in the pro-
life movement who give their time,

effort and support to. helping women.

than there are people trying to stop the
killing. There are more than 4,000 abor-
tion alfemative agencies in the United
States. They provide counseling, cloth-
ing, post-natal instruction, pre-natal
care, help with room and board, help
with adoption, post-abortion counsel-
ing, and other services. ’

I ﬁnd it interesting that pro-life cen-
ters have all these options when the
only “choice” you have at an abortion
mill is a dead baby. And so I ask, Can
pro—abortion people really call them-
selves pro—choice?

Pirr not as bad  

as you think ,.

If you’ve been reading the local
papers, you’ve already started to hear the
negative reaction to Pitt’s 48-41 win on
Saturday. The local “experts” are saying
we should think of the victory over the
Division I—AA Wildcats as a loss.

True, the Panthers didn’t look great,
but relax. It was only-the ﬁrst game of the
year. ’

Last year we lost to Temple, and we
damn near lost to Rutgers. Both of those
teams are a hell of a lot worse than
Villanova. But if you’ll recall, we also beat
three ranked" teams in  Virginia
Tech and West Virginia, and we went on to
play in a postseason bowl game.

There have been rumors ﬂoating
around the last couple of seasons about
Villanova’s wish to become a Division I-
A football program. So this was its big
chance to show it’s worthy of Division I
status. It had nothing to lose and a whole
lot to gain.

The Wildcats do have a solid football
program. Last year they were 12-1, losing
only to Division I-AA powerhouse
Youngstown State in the playoffs. In fact,
over the past 14 years, Villanova is 88-51-
1.

Compare those numbers to the
‘depressing records of Temple and Rutgers.
Temple was 3-8 last year; Rutgers was 0-
11. That has been par for the course for the
two Big East basement-dwellers this
decade» and, actually, for most of the
schools’ existences.

Villanova is still a scholarship pro-

1 gram with the ability to attract quality ath-

letes. If ‘Nova played Temple or Rutgers
head—to-head, who would your money be
on?

Better yet, if you were a quality high
school football player, maybe a bit too
small to get a scholarshipfrom a big-time
Division I school, would you go and toil in
the sickening programs of a - pathetic
Division I-A school like Rutgers or a high-
ly successful I-AA program like
Villanova? (For the record, a large number

- of NFL players. come out of I-AA

schools). ’ ~ .

My point is that a‘ close win to
Villanova is not an accurate predictor of
the rest of the season. And, in fact, many
people look past the fact that it was a 

At points in the game, Pitt dominated,

and it was not as close as the score indi- '

cated. It was Pitt’s poor special-teams play
‘ that let the game get as close as it did.

If our kick-coverage team could have
been at least mediocre, ‘Nova wouldn’t
have scored half as many points.

But I hope that will serve as‘a wake-

Villanova’s
broke two Wildcat records, broke
two ‘long touchdown runs, and
almost broke the back of the Pitt
Panther football team Saturday.

Rushing for over 116 yards and
scoring on two special teams plays,
the 5-foot-9-inch sophomore carried
the Wildcat _offense to 41’ points.
Pitt’s Matt Lytle answered with four
touchdown passes and led the
Panthers to a 48-41 win.

Westbrook racked up 428 all-
purpose yards against Pitt, enough to

shatter Villanova’s all—time mark of

322, set in 1950. His 192 return
yards‘ bested a mark that stood for
‘over a quarter-century. '

He did all of this playing with a
Division I-AA team _against __ the
Division I-A Panthers. — a fact not
lost on Pitt head coach Walt Harris.

“He looked like he could have
been playing a lot of places,” said
the coach, describing Westbrook.
“Their backs made us miss. And
they ran through us.”

quarter thanks to running back

Kevan Barlow, who didn’t_ start but
did run through a few Wildcats on
the Panthers’ opening drive.

With starter Brandon Williams
watching from the sidelines, Barlow
got the call on the last four plays of
Pitt’s first possession, including a 1-
yard touchdown run on the last play
of the drive. ' '

Hank Poteat made a leaping
interception to cut short the next
‘Nova drive and give Lytle the ball
at the Villanova 43.

Lytle responded by aiming for
some unheralded targets, including
an'l1-yard strike to reserve receiver
Julius Dixon for an early first down
and a 16-yard ﬂoater to backup full-
back Chris Schneider. to move inside
the 5—yard line- , .

unfamiliar name, hitting Latef Grim
for the first of the wideout’s three
touchdowns. Place-kicker Paul

game at that position, missed the
extra point to make it 13-0.

“[Latef] has some talent, as he
showed,” said Harris after the game.

Lytle impresses in 1998 debut

Shannon Heim .
Staff Wrlter

It’s been a year since head football
coach Walt Hanis made his Panther debut in
a 45-13 armihilation of Southwestern
Louisiana.

. ‘ In_his second Pitt season opener, Hanis
once again coached his team to victory, this
time clawing past the Wildcats of Villanova
in a 48-41 win.

So what are the diiferences in these
opening days? Let’s take a closer look at
Harris’ teams, past and present.

Although the air was clear and the fans
werepumpedaseachgamebegan,thistime
Pitt’s newly named 12th-Man Tenitory saw
a whole new ball game.

After losing the starting quarterback A

position to present Steeler Pete Gonzalez
last year, senior Matt Lytle retmned to the
starting position against Vllanova. He com-
piled impressive numbers, throwing for a
total of 349 yards and completing 23 of 36
pass attempts. Lytle also recorded four
touchdowns in Saturday’s game.

A year ago, Gonzalez, in his ﬁﬂh colle-

_ giate start, completed 16 of 30 passes, 212 .

yards, and recorded one fewer touchdown
than Lytle. But unlike this year’s quarter-

back, Gonzalez also rushed for 73 yards and
a touchdown-of his own against the Ragin’
Cajuns.

On the other end of _ the pass,
Gonzalez’s favorite receiver, Terry Murphy,
caught a 10-yard ‘touchdown pass and added
a 24-yard touchdown catch on the next pos-
session of last year’s opener, helping to
score Pitt’s ﬁrst 14 points of the game.

After a shoulder injury forced Mtnphy
out of the starting lineup, sophomore Latef
Grimsteppeduptoﬁllhisfellowwide

receiver’s shoes. On Saturday, Grim caught
eight passes for 192 yards, including a 38-
yard touchdown grab amidst double cover-
age and a 4-yard score before half—time.
Running back Kevan Barlow, currently
a sophomore, opened the margins of victo-
ry in both season debuts. Last August, he
had a 1-yard touchdown nm with 1:30‘ left
in the game. _ , . ‘

Barlow runs back into lineup

Kevin Lilley

senior Football Wrlter

Kevan Barlow summed up his
career in one play on Saturday.

‘With Pitt up by seven early in
the second half, Barlow took a
goal-line handoff and slammed
straight up the middle  right into a
wall of Wildcat defenders and
Panther blockers. '

He looked finished.

But just before the referee blew
the play dead, Barlow did some-
thing unexpected — he stood up
straight, planted both hisvfeet, and
reached forward with the football,
crossing the goal line.

Touchdown. Pitt went up 34-20
on the way to a 48-41 win, and
Barlow proved that he wasn’t quite
finished, either.

“He’s. capable of being a real
fine player,” said Pitt head coach
Walt Harris of Barlow. “I’d say he’s
really improved himself in the last
week.”

In the last. week, Barlow found
out that he would be coming off the
bench to start his sophomore sea-
son, backing up true freshman
Brandon Williams. Williams started
Saturday’s game with a 3-yard gain
on a sweep play‘ but came off the
field early and was replaced by
Barlow for much of the first half.

Barlow madgjhis presence felt
at the end; of thefﬁirst drive,. gaining
9 yards on’ his firs‘,t7c_arry to give Pitt
a first-and-goal the Vil.lanova 8-
yard line. _  

On that first down, he hauled in
a pass 9 from Matt Lytle and

‘slammed his way to the Villanova

4.

He gained 3 yards with a
straight-ahead rush on the next
play, falling short of the goal line

V after meeting inside linebacker
David Heckard in a head-on colli-
sion. c

The next play, instead of deal-
ing with Heckard, Barlow ran to his
right, sliding into the end zone just
before Aaron Weems the

Wildcats’ left outside linebacker — .

could make the stop.

The score put Pitt in the lead,
but the~Villanova offense — led by
record-breaking running back/ wide
receiver Brian Westbrook — came
back quickly.

With the Wildcats leading A20-13
after two straight scores, Barlow
showed more evidence of the
improvement Harris cited.

Lined up as a receiver on first
down, Barlow took off on a post
pattern at the snap.

By the time Lytle looked at him,

the running back liad blown-past‘

‘Nova defenders ' DeLonne Kelly
and Ademole Turner. Barlow made
an over-the-shouldercatch and ﬂew
into the end zone for the second
time in the contest, widening Pitt’s
" lead. ‘

The ball-handling trick would
make it three trips to paydirt, com-
plementing his 67 yards rushing
and 78 yards receiving.

Tursomr, 8 Srmaunrn 1998-

Women’s soccer loses to Georgetown and Notre Dame

Mario Machi

~ For The Pitt News

Head coach Roland Sturk and
the Lady Panther soccer team took
to the road last weekend to travel to
Georgetown and Notre Dame. It
was a split decision for the
Panthers, as they defeated
Georgetown but fell to the Fighting
Irish.

Pitt 2, Georgetown 1

Georgetown and Pitt were both

playing their first Big East game of J

the year Friday. The Hoyas set the
tone early in the game. At the 6:01

mark, Georgetown’s Kaitlin Frese
headed the ball past Panther goalie
Nicole Bashor for a 1-0 lead. The
rest of the half was dominated by
the defenses, as neither team could
get a goal before halftime.

But the Panthers regrouped and
played solidly in the second half.

' Just over four minutes into the
half, Charity McClure and Anya
Bohun-Chudyniv assisted on Cande
Ruiz’s tying goal. It appeared that
the game would go into overtime, as

‘each team had its chances, but _

couldn’t capitalize. .

However, a great pass by Kara
Kunkle to Ruiz resulted in the game
winner, as the Panthers took the

match by a score of 2-1. The
Panthers were outshot by the
Hoyas, 18-12, but Bashor had an
outstanding performance for the
Panthers, making eight saves.

Notre Dame‘9, Pitt 1

On Sunday, the Pitt took on No.
2-ranked Notre Dame in South
Bend,‘Ind. The Fighting Irish,
perennial powers in the women’s
soccer, showed that experience goes
a long way, as they defeated the

‘Panthers by a score of 9-1.

On a sunny, humid ‘day, the
Lady Panthers looked like they
were ready to notch the upset. At

just 7:36 into the game, Renee
Spampinato took a pass from
Bohun-Chudyniv and put the ball
past Notre Dame goalie LaKeysia
Beene for a 1-0 lead. '

Unfortunately for the Panthers,
that was one of only three shots
they had in the entire game. The
Irish got their first goal of the game
at the 12:22 mark when Shannon
Boxx collected a loose ball in the
box and scored on Panther goal-
keeper Sarah Stout.

Pitt fell behind 3-1 due to a pair
of goals from Jenny Heft, who
scored at the 16:53 point when she
tapped a header past Stout. Just
over a minute later, Heft turned the
trick again, this time taking a pass
from Jen Grubb to give the Irish the
two-goal lead. ' ’

The Panther defense looked
strong for the remainder of the first
half. Sturk and his team went into
the locker room with a two-goal
deficit.

The second half, however, was
when the" Irish proved they are
among the nation’s elite. Notre
Dame scored on four of its first five
shots in the second half and on six
of its first eighteen shots.

Anne Makinen had the first two I

goals of the second half for the
Irish, scoring in the 50th and 54th
minutes. By the 58-minute mark,
the Irish had broken the game open
with a 7-1 lead.

Notre Dame finished the game
with goals by freshmen Kelly
Tulisiak and Mia Sarkesian. The
Irish took a total of 40 shots, com-
pared to the Panthers’ three.

Notre improved its record to 3-
0-0, with a 2-0-0 record in the Big
East, while the Panthers dropped to
1-2-0 overall and 1-1-0 in confer-
ence play. The Panthers hit the road
this weekend to travel to Wagner on

Friday and St._John’s on Sunday.

WIN

Grim led all receivers with 192
yards inethe air, but Westbrook led
all players in rushing yards, recep-
tions, kick return yardage and just
about anything else.

Still, the Wildcat standout had
only 5 yards from scrimmage when
he lined up in the backfield to block
for Villanova’s punter late in the
first quarter.

The ball came back to
Westbrook instead of the punter, and
Westbrook took it 48 yards for a
touchdown to make the score 13-7.
He then scored on a 15-yard recep-
tion to give Villanova a 14-13 edge.

Afterward,‘ both offenses shut
down=for almost the whole second
quarter, as the Panthers and
Wildcats combined for 39 yards on
the next three series. Villanova
ended the drought when
Westbrook’s backup, junior Roger
Harriott, scored on a 17-yard run
with just over five minutes left in
the half. _

Poteat returned the ensuing
kickoff to the Pitt 40, and Lytle and
Barlow did the rest, hooking up for
a 60-yard touchdown play to tie the
score. Lytle hit Grim for a 38-yard
score on Pitt’s next drive, putting
the Panthers back on top, 27-20.

“I was pretty happy with my per-
formance,” Lytle said, but he quick-

FROM PAGE 10

ly added, “I’ve got _to see how the -

film was.”

Lytle drove the Panthers deep
into Villanova territory to begin the
second half, reaching the -1—yard line
thanks to rushes by Barlow and .full—
back Rickey Mendenhall and a pass-
interference penalty.

As for the_film, it may show that
on the next play, Barlow was actual-
ly stopped before he crossed the
goalline. The referees didn’t see it
that way, however, and Barlow
pushed in on second effort to put
Pitt up by 14. e

Another Lytle-Latef connection
made it 41-20, but the cheering stu-
dents, now expecting the rout that
they had expected in the first place,
were quickly silenced by
Westbrook’s 89-yard touchdown on

the kickoff return.

‘Nova’s Casey Hannon missed
the extra point, and the two teams
again traded touchdowns —— this
time with the ’Wildcats hitting on- a
two—point conversion —-- to make it
48-34. Villanova fullback Ducarmel
Augustin scored with l_ess than. two
minutes remaining to pull the

Wildcats to within a touchdown, but_

Panther Kenney Ketchen recovered
the onside kick and sealed the win.
“We are not pleased, by any
stretch,” said Harris of his team’s
performance. “We’ve got a lot of
young players, and we proved it.”

QB , ‘FROM PAGE 10

1-yard score in the second half, but he also
added to his numbers with a tremendous
60-yard catch in the Wildcat end zone, tying
the score at 20 before intermission.

While Barlow and the rest of the

Panther offense consistently racked up the
points in both openers, scoring more than
40 each year, this season’s defense lacked
the strength it displayed against
Southwestern Louisiana.
_ Although last year the defense held the
Ragin’ Cajuns to 277 yards and 13 points in
total offense, this year it allowed the
Wildcats to score 41 points.

Overall, this year’s season-opening
victory improved the Panthers’ opening-
day record to 69-32-2. They have won 8 of
their last 10 openers and are 15-5 in the last
two decades. - s

up call for the football team. The coaches
aren’t stupid. They realize that special
teams needs a lot of work, and they will
undoubtedly devote a ton of practice time
to that over the next two weeks before the
next game.

There are a lot of encouraging things
from Saturday’s game. For one thing, Matt
Lytle looks like he’s the real dealat quar-
terback. '

Despite heavy pressure from
Villanova defenders, Lytle completed 23
of his 34 pass attempts for 349 yards and

four touchdowns. That gives him a quar- '

terback efficiency rating of 192.69, ninth

1 best in_ the country.

Lastyear Pete Gonzalez came from
nowhere to become one of the country’s
top quarterbacks because he put his time in

learning the offense.

Many people felt going into this sea-
son that Pitt would only go as far as quar-
terback Lytle could take them. This off
season, Lytle did as Gonzalez did last year
and worked hard to learn and perfect Pitt’s
offense.

With the strong-armed quarterback
having a grasp of the system, there’s no
reason to believe he can’t have the kind of
year Gonzalez did last year. He might not
have as many touchdowns or yards, but he
will have at least as "many wins, if not
more.

It was ugly, but it was still a 
Don’t read too much into one game. The
year is young, and there’s a ton of football

5 left to be played.
