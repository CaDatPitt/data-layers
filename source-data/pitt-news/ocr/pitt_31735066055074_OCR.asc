The ‘'0'’ gives away french 
tries to promote new movie 

Alexis Tretiak
For The Pitt News

When the Original Hot Dog
Shop in Oakland serves a large
order of french fries, it’s one of the
world’s biggest, and Thursday the
store broke its own mold with a
batch that weighed close to 20
pounds.

The store gave it away for free.

But the french-fry giveaway that
began at 4 p.m. and attracted a
crowd of Pitt students, children and
even a tourist, wasn’t really free.
Warner Brothers paid for the 15- to
20-pound lump of fries to promote
the release of its new movie “Home
Fries.”

Makenzie Bobey, Pitt under-
graduate and intern for Warner

Brothers, along with Carol Sloam, a
Warner Brothers field representa-
tive, brainstormed promotional
ideas and decided that Pittsburgh’s
well—known fast food restaurant and
its popular fries would do the trick.

There are 25 Warner Brothers
representatives across the United
States who perform different promo-
tions for the new releases.

“All the major cities have repre-
sentatives, and we all have interns,”
Sloam said. “The intern program
actually started [for Warner
Brothers] 10 years ago, and we’ve
had them ever since.”

Drew Barrymore, Jake Busey
and Luke Wilson star in the roman-
tic comedy, premiering in the the-
aters Wednesday. Barrymore plays

20 students suffer

from mystery illness

Jason Gallinger

Assistant News Edltor

County oﬂicials have yet to determine the cause
of an ilhiess that resulted in about 20 Pitt students seek-
ing aid at Student Health Services for nausea and vom-

iting.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service said none of the stu-
dents was sick enough to warrant a trip to the hospital.
The symptoms of their illness were “relatively short

term” and subsided by Friday, Service said.

No additional cases were reported, “which was

the good news,” he said.

The cause of the illness has not been determined.
As a precautionary measure, Service said the
University ‘notiﬁed the Allegheny County Health

Department, which is conducting tests.

Early rumors suggested the students had contract-

ed food poisoning, perhaps even salmonella.

The Health Department does not believe food poi-
soning was the cause, Service said. The symptoms of
the illness came on too quickly for a food-bom illness,

he added.

“Everyone is conﬁdent that there is no hazard to
students to eating in any of the campus eateries,”

Service said.

The Health Department will work with Dr. Rita

Pitt grad Deneene Brockington returns toghelp run the Kuntu Repertory
Theatre. Here she'll try to increase Kuntu's earned income.

Pitt grad named director
of Kuntu Repertory

Christal Hall
Staff Writer

When Deneene Brockington
worked at the Freedom Theatre in
Philadelphia, she helped double
ticket revenues and increase the
number of theater patrons from
8,000 to 37,000 in three. years.

Now she’s at Pitt, using her
expertise to serve as director of the
Kuntu Repertory Theatre.

“I’m committed to seeing
African-Americans prosper in the-
ater,” said Brockington.

Her responsibilities are increas-
ing earned income, assessing the
strengths and weakness of Kuntu,
and reviewing budgetary needs.

“The possibilities are endless,”
said Brockington in a statement. “I
see the resources available that
Kuntu can tap into to make it a
strong national voice for the
African-American community.”

Although Brockington’s job is
to oversee the day-to—day opera-
tions of the theater, she doesn’t
make any decisions without the
approval of the president, Esrick O.
McCartha, and founder, Pitt African
studies Professor Vernell A. Lillie.

“As president, I know every-
thing that is going on, and Deneene
lifts the burden of financial plan-
ning, goal assessments and propos-
al writing,” said McCartha. “She’s
my right and left hand.”

Kuntu Repertory Theatre is part

of Pitt’s Africana studies depart-
ment. It has sought to provide
entertainment that is historically
accurate, intellectually stimulating
and socially relevant.

For 24 years, Kuntu Repertory
Theatre has given the Pittsburgh
community a cultural voice that
speaks to the African-American
experience throughout the diaspora
and that could otherwise be
unheard.

The diaspora is all the African
people in the world, including
Africans on continental Africa, in
the United States, in the Caribbean
and in South America.

Brockington, a former member
of Kuntu, graduated from Pitt in
1992 with a degree in business.

“During my junior year, it was
too late to change my major to act-
ing, so I combined my love of act-
ing with business administration,”
said Brockington.

According to a Kuntu press
release, the theatre’s intent has been
to examine the black life from a
socio—political—historical perspec-
tive, and to combine the important
features of theater — education and

entertainment — to move both the
performers and audiences to social
change.

The word “kuntu’ is a Bantu
word meaning “way or mode.”

  Woman finds calling

helping homeless

Joseph Gordon

Staff Writer

Walking through Rock Creek
Park in Washington, D.C., during the
summer of 1978, Sharon Thorp felt
nothing but despair and alienation.
She had been abandoned twice in her
life, once by her mother when she
was 10 years old and then by her
grandparents, who, she said, never
wanted her around.

As she wondered if she would
ever find her calling in life, she sud-
denly encountered a homeless
woman pushing an old shopping
cart.

“This lady dressed like a
Vagabond caught my attention,”
Thorp said. “Her face gave off a
warm feeling. When our eyes
locked, I felt her telling me that I am
somebody and that I am loved.
Though she never said a word to me,
I knew that’s what she was saying.”

From that moment, Thorp said
she knew her life’s work would be
helping the homeless live better
lives. .

She began volunteering her ser-
vices at a homeless shelter, taking
care of mentally retarded men. She
eventually found the calling that
transformed her from a little girl
nobody wanted to a woman who
dishes out unconditional love to
homeless people as the director of
Wood Street Commons, a homeless
shelter in Pittsburgh.

“Even though I never got that

lady’s name, what she gave me that
summer day inspired me to do some-
thing to improve the lives of many
people like her,” Thorp said. “Giving
homeless people a sense of security
and showing them that they are
loved and respected will not only
improve their self-worth, but also
improve their overall well-being.”

Thorp, now 50, was raised in
Washington, D.C. Her parents,
James and Elizabeth Campbell,
divorced when she was 8 years old,
and her father moved to Pittsburgh.
She didn’t reestablish contact with
him again until she was 20 years old.

Elizabeth Campbell was a light-
skinned black woman who was able
to pass for white, Thorp said. As a
result, she worked as a government
employee, earning a good salary.

As Thorp matured, her hair tex-
ture changed from straight to kinky,
and her complexion gradually grew
darker. Campbell feared her race
would be discovered, so at age 10,
Thorp went to live with her grand-
parents.

“Because my mother could pass
for a white woman, she gave me to
my grandparents because she didn’t
want to be detected as being black;
which could have caused her to lose
her job,” said Thorp.

Thorp said her grandparents
reluctantly took her in. They didn’t
want the responsibility of taking
care of a child, and they resented

having her around.

“I can remember knocking a
glass of water off the table acciden-
tally, and my grandmother, out of
anger, gave me my first beating, and
she said things that further deterio-
rated my already low self-esteem,”
Thorp said.

Thorp started smoking marijuana
in 1966, trying to escape her feel-
ings. That led to other drugs. She
eventually realized she no longer
wanted to continue living the way
she was, and she attempted suicide.

“I gave myself an overdose of
heroin, a drug I had never tried
before,” she said. “When I woke up,

mom PAGE 3

THE PITT Nsws

I was in a tub full of ice. Some
friends that I was hanging out with at
that time did what they thought was
best. I wanted to die.”

Instead of drugs, Thorp turned
her attention to caring for 10 mental-
ly retarded men. Developing rela-
tionships with them only fostered her
desire to do more, she said.

That experience led Thorp to her
present job as director of Wood
Street Commons

Thorp’s husband, Govner, said,
“When she accepted this job, I knew

' that it was something that she want-

ed. I also knew that she always had
the desire to improve the homeless
situation in the ‘Burgh because that
was all she talked about.”

The people living at Wood Street

Commons range from a 7-year-old
girl to a woman who is 92 years old.
When Thorp took control of the daily
operation, she instituted plans that
included providing meals in addition
to a warm, clean place to sleep. She
also has implemented a way for
homeless people can earn money to
enhance their status in life.

She introduced a street newspa-
per called StreetVoice, which enables
homeless people to sell papers and
keep the profits for themselves.

Thorp lives in Penn Hills with
her husband and two children. She
often brings her family to Wood
Street Commons to lend a hand.

“The efforts that my mother put
forth to make people who are less
fortunate than her is wonderful,”

said Thorp’s 28-year-old daughter,
Pamela. “She instilled in my brother
and me that we are a product of our
environment and that we are no bet-

Shirley, a 92-year-old woman,
was the first person Thorp met at
Wood Street Commons. Thorp said
she reminded her of the homeless

pays Shirley a visit, they sit around

with Miss Shirley. Their compassion

The Mrs. Pennsylvania pageant
will never be the same again

Oh, for the love of God!

Rhonda I.ewan was stripped of
her crown as Mrs. Pemrsylvania 1998
when it was discovered the contest
had been rigged in her favor. Pageant
director Denise Becker and two other
contest oﬂicials were charged with
theft, conspiracy and rigging the
results of a public contest. Five
months after the pageant, Rita Marie
Roley was named the 1998 winner.

No one’s ever going to take the
contest seriously after this ﬁasco. This
scandal has tainted the housewife
beauty pageant industry. Beauty con-
tests involving mothers and home-
makers in their 30s have been ren-
dered a joke. Not even Donald
Trump, the father of the billion-dollar
pageant industry, can save the
respectability, prestige and honor of
the title that is Mrs. Pennsylvania

Of all the games, pageants and
competitions that could have been
rigged, why did they have to spit in
the face of beautiful, rniddle-aged
mothers? Did the organizers have
nothing better to rig? Were contests
such as the armual Miss Vagina
pageant, held every year in
Amsterdam, the Netherlands, too
sacred to be mocked by three special
interests overriding the votes of the
majority of the judges?

Unfortunately, nothing these days
is beyond behind-the-scenes conup-
tion. The Pitt Panthers played their
games like each one was being
rigged. VVrthout some ﬁnancial
 how else could a team
with a nationally ranked defense lose
to both Temple and Rutgers?

A sure conﬁnnation of Pitt being
paid to lose, though, would have been
Panther losses to Vrllanova and
Akron. But the real test will be the
Backyard Brawl. No one would ever
believe that Pitt could lose to West
Virginia. IfPitt can’t beat WVU, it’s a
sine sign that Pitt pockets are being
lined

As we speak, elections in Third
World nations are being rigged by
U.S. government and business inter-
ests. Right—wing dictators are being
funded and supported by a U.S.-
backed propaganda blitzkrieg with
the aim of keeping real Third World
refomrers out of the political sphere.
Need we mention military assistance
such as the United States’ support of
right-wing Contra rebels in
Nicaragua?

As long as Pennsylvania’s house-
wives are wrongfully crowned in cor-
rupted competitions, real democracy
will never exist in these United States
of America

Debate can only be enlightening

I was recently afforded a fascinating
glimpse into the conservative/evangelical/fun-
damentalist Christian mind. The medium
through which I gained this insight was a
debate (well, technically, it was a “discussion,”
but it sure smelled like a debate) between two
Pitt News columnists on the ever-controversial
topic of homosexuality. It seems that whenever
this particular issue comes up, someone ends
up with his or her nose horribly out of joint,

and nothing truly profound or enlightening is.

ever said. But, like a good car crash, you can’t
help yourself from watching and enjoying.

This debate, sadly, was no exception. I
really didn’t hear anything from either side I
hadn’t heard before. I don’t know that I neces-
sarily expected to hear something new, but I
was certainly hoping. The trouble with open
dialogue such as this is that unless there is
some type of new or interesting
viewpoint being brought to the M ARK
table, such discussion quickly
devolves into some form of
rhetorical masturbation. It does
nothing to expand people’s hori-
zons or offer them a new way of looking at an
issue. It is an exercise in demonstrating, “This
is how much I know, and I know more than
you, so I must be right.” It is the most basic
form of free speech known to democracy.

This is not to say I didn’t get anything out
of this debate. Quite the opposite — it made
me think about Christian doctrine and how
malleable it can be. The Bible is such an epic
and somewhat esoteric document that any part
of it can be interpreted to ﬁt any agenda, no
matter how insidious. Regardless of one’s
beliefs on the fallibility of the Bible or on its
need to be interpreted literally, this has been
done by both oppressors and the oppressed
since the beginning of the Bible’s history. This
is what makes it one of the most important and
powerful texts in history. But with any power
comes the possibility of its misuse. Therein lies
the danger.

Since people will never come to a consen-
sus on what, exactly, the Bible has to say about
homosexuality (or any other controversial
issue, for that matter), why not think of the
issue in the larger context of Christian doctrine
as a whole instead of what a speciﬁc scripture
has to say? I may be a bit rusty on my Christian

dogma, having not been willing to call myself
a Christian since I was 13, but I’ve always
believed that God was supposed to be the high-
er judge. He is, after all, supposed to have been

mate “author.” If Christians truly believe that
God is the highest judge, why do his job by
arbitrarily deciding that homosexuality is
wrong?

Life would be so much simpler and more
pleasant if people would just let others live
their lives instead of trying to convince them
that what they are doing is wrong. If it doesn’t
affect you in a real and personal way, you real-
ly have no business telling another person what
is right for him or her to do in the privacy of his
or her own home. I realize that Christian doc-
trine teaches that Christians are obligated to
spread “the word” to their non-Christian neigh-
bors. But “the word” has almost as
many different interpretations as there
are people who believe in it. Modern
evangelism, too, often fails to recog-
nize this, and we end up with people
who are so convinced that their inter-
pretation is the only right one and aren’t even
willing to listen to someone else’s views.

This is one of the major issues that I per-
sonally have with evangelism in general. Its
main intention is to convince people that their
own personal spirituality is fundamentally
wrong and that “salvation” and personal happi-
ness can only be achieved through the form of
spirituality that the evangelist subscribes to.
Spirituality is intrinsically a very personal
thing. To try to make it into a political issue or
into something that can be put into the cate-
gories “wrong” and “right” is not only foolish,
it is wrong. Everyone has his or her own ideas
about what is wrong, what is right and where
and when he or she is going to die.

Instead of trying to convert people to your A

belief system, why not engage in a real and
productive conversation about it? You have
every right to ignore what others have to say,

just as they have the right to ignore what you 
have to say. But if you listen carefully enough, 

you might actually learn something.

THE PITT News: OPINIONS

Fcrkery not exclusive to pro-wrestling

Brian Knavlsh

Asslstant Sports Editor

Ever since Jesse Ventura was elected
governor of Minnesota, professional
wrestling has received a lot more attention
and criticism from the “mainstream” pub-
lic.

Uninformed people who haven’t
tuned into a WWF show in years throw
around age-old stereotypes of professional
wrestling and conderrm it like it’s some
fonn of Satanic worship. The No. 1 sin of
professional wrestling in the eyes of the
critics is, “It’s stupid ‘cause it’s fake.”

Wait, you mean to tell me that they
actually broadcast stuff on TV that isn’t
true!?

The thing that blows my mind about
these people is that after they’re done
attacking me for watching this horrid
“fake” entertainment, they go home and
click on “Seinfeld” or rent “Good Will
Hunting.” It’s this hypocrisy that really
pisses me off. In case you didn’t notice,
virtually all fonns of entertainment are ﬁc-
tion, which makes them fake.

The hypocrites get all bent out of
shape because they notice that Steve
Austin “doesn’t really punch” Shawn
Michaels, but they have no problem with
Hollywood when Mel Gibson “preten ”
to beat up a “bad guy” in “Lethal Weapon”
or when Al Pacino “preten ” to shoot

someone in "The Godfather.”

Well the truth is that none of “us” actu-
ally thinks pro wrestling is real. In fact, the
companies don’t even claim that their
product is real anymore. The WWF goes
out of its way to call itself an “entertain-
ment company,” not a “wrestling compa-
ny.” But the uninformed critics aren’t
aware of this; they think the promoters are

because it’s Shakespeare.

Yes, wrestling is stupid. But it’s a fact
of life that many people enjoy watching
stupid, wacky things. Ever watched “The
Naked Gun” or “Billy Madison”? Both are
pretty stupid; both are pretty entertaining.

If your problem with pro wrestling is
that it is too much of a blend of reality and
ﬁction because of the similarities to very

“Luke,  I  am  a  pu—  pet.”

The reason we watch pro wrestling is
to suspend reality, just like any other form
of ﬁction. Wrestling is no more fake than
“Star Wars,” "The Cosby Show” or “Pet
Semetary.”

It’s a hell of a lot more real than many
respectable “classic works of ﬁction,” like
Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s
Dream,” where a guy gets turned into an
ass and there are a bunch of fairies ﬂutter-
ing around. But it’s OK for that to be fake

wrestling because it gloriﬁes sex and vio-
lence. I admit, it deﬁnitely does this, but
don’t single out pro wrestling because it
doesn’t glorify sex or violence more than
most of today’s television. Pro wrestling
has changed dramatically over the past
couple of years, and that’s part of the rea-
son it is more popular than ever.

A&E and Time magazine ran features
documenting its staggering popularity.
According to A&E, more people tune in to

rstwhile Pitt News
Egtolumnist Paul Clark was
it again. When his

prose last graced (or, more pre-

cisely, cursed) these pages,
Clark was calling maintenance

workers “urmecessary” and urg-

ing students to act as volunteer
scabs in the event of a strike.
Having left The Pitt News —— no
doubt in order to lend credence
to gripes about the paper’s “lib-
eral bias” — Clark is now
ensconced as editor in chief of
The Phoenix, the gay-baiting
rightist tabloid whose editors
modestly describe themselves
in their November issue as
“lantem-bearers shining our just
light for those who still hold
clear the rights of life and liber-
ty.” (Verbal clurnsiness in origi-
nal.)

If there’s one thing lower
than a scab, it’s a scab-wannabe.
But with these credentials
already under his belt. Clark has
decided to add another:
warmabe police—snitch. To do
so, he has printed a photograph
of anti—Phoenix “vandalism”

with the clear implication that
he is inviting the cops to clamp
down. In the accompanying
article, Clark is most indignant
about the graﬂ:'Iti’s assertion that
Pitt “supports” The Phoenix.
Clark has a point against the
wall-scribblers on this score.

The Phoenix is extremely
vocal about its refusal to take
money from the student activi-
ties fee. But here, of course, is
where the paper’s platitudes
cross over into the realm of
mere half-truth, for it simply
doesn’t need money from the
activities fee.

The Phoenix is lacking in
no resources aside from talent. It
takes money from outside
wealthy interests so that it can
assume a position of contrived
moral superiority in advocating
the denial of University funds to
everyone else. In the Phoenix’s
world view, free speech is
reserved for those who have a
lot of money.

y challenge to Pitt

Barnett still stands: Either pre-
sent evidence that the Sudanese

facility bombed by the United
States in August was producing
chemical weapons, or join most

stitute? VV1tness the spec-

le of privileged col-

compliments of The Pitt News.
Mark Campbell’s Nov. 11 col-
mm on panhandling made up in
sugary condescension for what
it lacked in abrasive reactionary
bombast. Tony Oliva’s Nov. 2
column, of course, possessed
both in spades.

The whole thing fairly drips
with the feudal mentality. Take
this, for example: “I have, on
numerous occasions, given
money to a guy playing guitar.
harmonica, trumpet or ﬂute. 
If you want to show compas-
sion, force them to become
something better.”

One can easily picture
Massa Tony on some God-for-

saken plantation circa 1850
barking out: “Dance for me,
Sarnbo!” Where’s Nat Thmer
when we need him?

Then there is Oliva’s asser-
tion that “you’re wron ” if you
think he “doesn’t know the ﬁrst
thing about what the bums on
Forbes Avenue are going
through.” He does know what
they’re going through, he says,
because “bums” have asked
him for money before.

You may think that not
even Oliva could be responsible
for such a sturmingly idiotic non
sequitur, yet I do not exaggerate.
This stinking heap of offal —
tastefully accompanied by a
vaguely neo-Nazi drawing ren-
dered by a Pitt News artist —
has made the world that much a
darker place by its appearance
in print. Anyone who read it

statistic? Austin 3:16 shirts are the No.1-

The only problem I have with profes-
sional wrestling is that it calls itself
“wrestling,” which it deﬁnitely is not.
Wrestling, especially at the college level, is
a very real, very competitive sport, for
which I have the utmost respect. But that
doesn’t make television’s professional
wrestling any less entertaining or a wresﬂer
any less of an athlete.

But the pro wrestling critics, people I
like to call hypo-critics, will continue to be
disgusted by this “fakery” simply because
they want to see it as fake. But unless they
detest all ﬁction for being fake, they really
have no grounds to make these attacks.

And if you are.-going to make these
attacks, watch at least one full episode of
WWF “RAW” ﬁrst. (Don’t watch WCW
because it is boring.)

So listen up, hypo-critics, no one’s
asking you to be a fan of pro wrestling; it’s
doing just ﬁne without you. But before
criticizing it, take a look in the mirror, and
examine just how fake the entertainment
you watch is.

. ':(7:iA:V;SH
What a change
from last year

Just like last year, the game was on a
Thrirsday night. Just like last year, the game
was nationally televised on ESPN.

But right about there is where the simi-
larities between last year’s version of the
Pitt—Miarni game and this year’s version
end

It was that heart—stopping victory over
Miami that brought the goal posts falling
and rriade the Panther faithful realize that the
l997teamwas forreal. It was thatgamethat
made the program respectable again.

For  1997 wasn’t a memorable
year. Itmarkedtlieﬁrsttimeinyearsthatthe
Hurricanes failed to make a postseason
bowl. Worse than that, they didn’t even have
a winning season.

This -was hard for Miami to swallow.
Thiswasateamthatregularlywasaoon-
tender for national championships through-
out the ‘80s and early ‘90s.

The NCAA violations that limited the
Hurricanes’ scholarships ﬁnally caught up
with them. The Hurricanes went home for
the holidays and watched Big East foes Pitt,
Syracuse, Virginia Tech and West Virginia
bask in the gala of New Year’s football.

But the 1998 installment of the game
once again saw Pitt and Miami coming into
the game on opposite ends of the spectrum.

It seerris as though Miami hit rock bot-
tom last season and has responded by climb-
ing back up the football ranks this year.

But what’s surprising is how fast the
Hurricanes have done that. They’ve already
reclaimed their place among the nation’s top
25. They are now ranked No. 20 in the coun-
try, and next weekend’s clash with Syracuse
will be for the Big East title.

What’s even scarier for the rest of the
Big East is that Miami is ayoung team. That
means that most of the team’s youngsters
will develop into monsters over the next few
years.

For Pitt, on the other hand, 1998 is a
seasonthatcanbebestdescribedasdisap-
pointing.

Maybe all the bowl predictions for this
season were a bit too lofty, considering how
much the team lost from last season’s squad.
It’s not easy to replace guys with the ﬁre of
Pete Gonzalez, Billy West, Dwayne
Schulters and John Jenkins.

But still, no one expected Pitt to be 2-8
heading into the season ﬁnale. No one
would have guessed Pitt would still be
searching for its ﬁrst Big East win.

So is Fiiday’s Pitt—West Virginia game
at Three Rivers worth watching? Wﬂl it be a
Mountaineer trouncing of the Panthers?

Amos Zereoue and West Virginia are a
talented bunch. They have a lot to play for,

Pitt backed into the Big East volleyball
tournament by earning a tie for sixth place
in the conference, but once the Lady
Panthers were there, they made an irnpres—
sron.

Pitt lost to eventual champion Notre
Dame in the ﬁrst round, 3-1. Pitt lost the
ﬁrst game, 15-10, but held the lead most of
the way before Notre Dame went on a late
run.

The second game was a close one all
the way before Pitt squeaked out a 16-14
win. This gave the Lady Panthers some
momenturri, but they could not hold it in the
third game, as the Irish took a 14-12 win.

Intheﬁnalgame,Pitthadaleadof14—
12 before the Irish won the game, 16-14, to
ﬁnish the match.

“We had nothing to lose,” junior Paula
Zemrowski said.

She ledtheteaminkillswitli20onthe
day and also learned that she was narried to
the All—Big East second team.

Notre Dame had an impressive service
game Saturday with nine aces. The Irish
had a very good game after they were beat-
en by West Virgiriia last week.

“They played with a lot more zeal than
I thought they would,” said head coach
Cindy Alvear.

The Lady Panthers fought their way

through difficulty all
day with hustle and
enthusiasm, but their
execution was not 
always perfect. '

All day, there
were Lady Panthers on
the ﬂoor, diving, slid-
ing and chasing down
balls. Every player hit
the ﬂoor on Saturday.

The team’s elfort
was “fabulous,” and
its execution was
“spotty,” according to
Alvear.

Pitt had 40 attack 
errors on the day,

which hurt its game a
great deal. Many times
when Pitt had the
chance to put the game away, the Lady
Panthers made a costly mistake.

The Pitt volleyball program has a rich
history. The Lady Panthers own 10 Big East

championships, and they have been the run-

ners-up ﬁve times.

Between 1988 and 1994, Pitt won all
seven Big East titles. Alvear cited the
change in the conference over the last few
years as one of the reasons Pitt has had a
tough time in the Big East lately.

“Five years ago, all the teams became
fully funded,” Alvear said.

Melissa Alpers shows some hustle in Saturday's loss.

Before that time, Pitt was one of the
only teams that received complete universi-
ty funding.

“VVith the personnel we have, the go—to
people are two sophomores and two
juniors,” Alvear said. “None have consis-
tently started and gone all the way around.”

Because of their youth, the Lady
Panthers had no idea what the pressure felt
like.

“They hadn’t been there enough to
know where to go for what they needed,”
Alvear said.

Vonteego Cummings showed once
again why he alone could deliver the
Panthers a bid to the NCAA tourna-
ment. The senior guard scored 29
points in his second game back from a
hand injury to lead Pitt to a 76-65 vic-
tory over Wright State Friday.

The Panthers moved to 3-0 on the
season, the first time that has happened
since the 1993-94 season, when Pitt
won its first four games.

Cummings scored all but two of
the final 15 points Pitt scored in its
first road contest of the season. He
scored big baskets down the stretch
when it appeared the Panthers might
not have left Dayton, Ohio, with a vic-
tory over the Raiders.

who scored 14 points in the game, put

Miami trounces Pitt, 38-10

Patrick Robertson
Sports Editor

The Miami Hurricanes dominated the
Panthers Thursday night, beating Pitt, 38-10.

Miami had revenge on its mind after
Pitt’s Homecoming win last year, and
revenge is what the Hurricanes got.

The game started well for both teams.
Less than three minutes in, on the
Hurricanes’ ﬁrst possession, running back
Edgenin James blocked a Pitt defender in
the backﬁeld and released to the left side.

Quarterback Scott Covington dropped
back and found James wide open in the ﬂat.
James took off down the sideline, avoiding
two would—be Panther tacklers on his way to
a 69-yard touchdown catch.

With the extra point, Miami took a 7-0
lead, and things looked very bad for the
Panthers.

This drive took 52 seconds. Coming
into the game, 24 of Miarni’s touchdown dri-
ves took less than two minutes off the clock
Of those 24, 14 lasted less than one minute.

The Panthers’ situation got even worse
on their next possession, when Matt Lytle
rolled out and threw a pass behind Terry
Murphy, who was rrmning a slant route
across the middle.

Murphy reached behind him as he came
across the middle to catch the ball, but he
tipped the ball right into the hands of Miami
defender Delvin Brown.

Pitt’s defense was able to force Miami

. to punt after the tumover to put the ball back

in Lytle’s hands.

Lytle looked for Murphy again, and this
time, the two hooked up for a 31-yard gain.
Murphy jumped a little early for the ball over
Markese Fitzgerald. Murphy was able to
come up with a highlight-reel catch, as he
grabbedtheballwithonehandafterthe
jump.

Three plays later, Lytle dropped back
and found RJ. English for a Panther touch-
down.

Nick Lotz added the extra point to knot
the game at 7.

This would be the last time Pitt was in
the game, as Miami took control on the next
drive.

Reggie Wayne caught two passes for 49
yards on the drive to set up the Hurricanes at
the Panther 2—yard line.

Miami rushed James up the middle, but
he was stopped for no gain by Arnir Purifoy
and Lee Lightener. On the next play, Miami
gave James the ball again, and he gained 1
yard before being stopped by Ryan Gonsales
and Seth Homack

Miami tried something different on the
next play leaving the ball in Covington’s
hands. The signal—caller rushed for no gain,
leaving a fourth—and—goal at the 1 after the
stop by Mike White.

James got the call one last time on
fourth down, and he responded by scoring
his second touchdown of the game to give
Miami a 14-7 lead with 14 seconds left on

Weather hurts Panthers

Geoff Moak
Staff Writer

The scoreboard said, Hurricanes 38,
Panthers 10. But the Hurricanes weren’t
Pitt’s only meteorological opponents
Thursday night at the Orange Bowl. There
are two other signiﬁcant numbers on the
ﬁnal stat sheet: 87 degrees and 72 percent.

Those numbers were the temperature
and the relative humidity in  and they
reveal almost as much about the way the
game progressed as the ﬁnal score does.

The Panthers were not a deep team
coming into the game. Among other players,
Pitt’s leading receiver, Latef Grim, missed
the game due to an injury. As Pitt head coach
Walt Harris said after the game, it’s hard to
win when you “[lose] your only marquee
player on oﬁ°ense and [have to] replace him
with a redshirt freshman walk-on.”

R.J. English, Grim’s replacement, put
forth an admirable effort. This was English’s
ﬁrst game as a starter, and the inexperience
showed at times.

“[English] told me it’s a lot different
coming in and spelling a guy than it is play-
ing a whole game,” Hanis said

It’s especially diiferent when the game
is played in the kind of heat and humidity
there was in  Those conditions work
very quickly against a player who doesn’t
have the opportunity to rest the way he’s
used to. The problem was compounded

game in the third quarter with an injury.

English and the receivers weren’t alone.
Starting offensive lineman Ethan Weidle
was also out of the lineup for this game with
an injury. His absence wreaked havoc on the
entire offensive line, a group of players that
tends to need a rest more often than most.

“[Weidle] is a guy who plays both guard
and tackle for us. That gives us a little more
ﬂexibility in resting people on a hot, humid
night.” Harris said.

The Panthers just didn’t have the man-
power or the energy to compete.

“We’re running on fumes right now
because we’re so thin.  This game wore us
out,” Harris said. The weary-sounding tone
of his voice (and this from a man who didn’t
even play in the game) underscored his
words.

But all was not lost. Even the head
coach leamedi something from the experi-
ence of playing in 

“Part of the reason this game wore us
out is not just because of the weather and the
number of players we have  but because of
thekindofpracticewehadtodoinorderto
get ourselves ready to play this game,”
Harris said “We’ve got to be really intelli-
gent this week in our practices.”

Whatthatmeans is thatthis won’tbethe
kind of loss that prompts a coach to put his
team through even more rigorous practices.

“We’ve got a little time to rest,” Harris
said. “I think our guys need to get away from

_ football and get healthy.”

game with a little more than threemin-
utes to play.

“They [Wright State] got some
easy transition baskets and some easy
shots,” Willard recalled.

Cummings wasn’t finished with
the Raiders, though, scoring the next
11 points on two of his four three-
pointers and five free throws. This
came from a man on the mend from a
broken hand.

“It’s still sore,” said Cummings,
“but I’ve got to keep working with it,
keep playing.”

The Panthers were shorthanded,
playing only seven men in the game.
Stephen Flores, out with a broken

thumb, did suit up but did not play.
Guards Fred Primus and Jeremy
Holmes were also down. Holmes re-
injured the eye that was cut in the pre-
vious game, and Primus did not play
due to a knee injury that is believed to
be tendinitis.

Pitt’s only senior, Cummings, res-
cued the them the team, scoring 19
points in the second half. Ricardo
Greer added 15 points and seven
rebounds, and Attila Cosby, playing
with a fractured ﬁnger, scored 12 and
had seven rebounds. Wright State’s
Brooks barely missed a triple—doub1e,

assists to go along with his 14 points.

so will they roll over Pitt, which will be
mopping up its season? Don’t bet on it.

Onetl1ingtlratcan’tbequestionedis the
heart and drive Walt Harris has instilled in
his players . They might not have as much
talent as the Mormtaineers, but they won’t
quit. Harris won’t let them.

The Backyard Brawl is traditionally a
good game. Sure, WVU is playing for a
bowl game, but Pitt is playing for pride.

Pitt’s season is all but gone, but the one
thing that could grab a little satisfaction for
the players and the fans would be a season-
ending upset of WVU.

The players hate losing like this. 'Ihey
remember what they did to WVU last year,
and they know the Mountain-queers will be
looking for some payback

And yes, Pitt has a chance. West
Virginiaistalented,andAmosZereoueisa
top-notch back, but the Mountaineers are
notasgoodasVrrginiaTech,Syracuseor
Penn State.

The Panthers played with those teams,
so theycansureplaywithWVU.Infact,
with their pride on the line, this game is Pitt’s
whole season.

Brian Knavish is the assistant sports editor
of The Pitt News, and he will not be dress-
ing up farm animals in preparation for
F ridayis game, unlike some people.
