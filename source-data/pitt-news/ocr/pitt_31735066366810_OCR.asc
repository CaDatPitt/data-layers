Officials Head Ceremonies
For New Engineering Hall  

University officials broke ground
for the University’s Michael L.
Benedum Hall of Engineering
last Thursday at the Logan Ar-
mory site. Participating in the
groundbreaking were A. J. Ca-
ruso, executive director of the
General State Authority; Dr. Da-
vid Kurtzman, acting chancellor;
David Lawrence, former Gover-
nor of Pennsylvania; and Harold
E. Hoelscher, dean of engineer-
ing. The ceremonies were a part
of the Engineer’s Week program.

Highlighting Engineer’s Week
was the awarding of an honorary
Doctor of Engineering degree to
Maxime A. Faget, assistant direc-
tor for engineering and develop-
ment at the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration's
_(NASA) Manned Spacecraft Cen-
ter. He is responsible for all on-
board systems for the Apollo
spacecraft.

Faget, who is recognized today
as one of this country’s leading
authorities on spacecraft design
and operation, spoke to Univer-
sity engineering alumni at their
Annual» Dinner at Hotel Webster
Hall Wednesday. He also talked
with University engineering stu-
dents on “Engineering for Man-
ned Space Flight” at a seminar
after the degree ceremony.

Faget prefaced his seminar
talk by stressing the importance
of‘ technical honesty in engineer-
ing. Also, he cited simplicity as
an important concept and urged
engineers to avoid technical “cute-

' ness.”

The main part of his lecture
dealt with the plans for the Apol-
lo moon landing attempt. Inter-
spersing his talk with slides, Fa-
get described the launching of
the space vehicle into a parking
orbit around the earth, and the
subsequent rearranging of the
command service, and lunar ex-
cursion modules.

He elaborated on the moon
landing procedure, explaining
how the lunar excursion module
(LEM) will disengage from the
command module with two pilots
aboard and effect a landing on

the moon followed by a lunar
surface exploration by a single
astronaut. Then, the LEM will
lift-off from the moon’s surface
and rendezvous and dock with
-the command module; the astro-
nauts Will transfer to the mother

ship; and the service and excur-

sion modules will be jetisoned
for the trip back to earth.

Faget presented an eight-min--

ute ﬁlm of Astronaut White’s'
“walk in space” to the engineer-
ing student body. It will be shown
to the University community at
a later date.

The $20 million Michael C. Ben-
edum Hall of Engineering will
provide laboratory, study and

classroom facilities for 2,400 un-
dergraduates and 1,000 graduate
engineering students, which will
approximately double the present
enrollment of the School of Engi-
neering.

The 12-story building,
will be completed by 1968, will
centralize the departments that
are now spread throughout "six
buildings. Each of the top 11
floors will contain a central core
of laboratories surrounded by
classrooms, offices, and confer-
ence rooms. There will be a-total
of 38 ‘classrooms, .207 offices for
faculty and graduate students, 16
shops, 184 laboratories, and 12
conference rooms. ‘

Blaise New Director
Of Ecuadorian Project

Dr. Hans C. Blaise, a Uni-
versity professor who has
been mainly concerned with
building institutions of high-
er education has been named
Chief of Party for the Universi-
ty’s Ecuador Project. The project,
begun in 1963, is a long-range
program, subsidized by the Agen-
cy for International Develop-
ment (AID), to develop the Cen-
tral University of Quito. _

E The appointment was preceded
by the signing of a new two-and-

a-half contract with AID to con- ~

tinue to strengthen the Ecuador
University through special train-
ing courses, faculty and admin-
istrative guidance, provided by
the University.

Dr. Blaise, who will arrive in
Ecuador May 1 to direct the’ pro-
gram, lists as his two broad ob-
jectives: to develop coordinated
academic and professional pro-
grams within the University, and
to relate the work of the Univer-
sity to the economic and social
development of the country.

Like many other Latin Ameri-
can universities, Central Univer-
sity was a collection of largely
autonomous professional schools.
Students enrolled directly for

. study in a given profession, such

as medicine, and were. conﬁned
to courses offered by the faculty
in that profession. Few programs
leading to an academic degree in
the natural or social sciences
were offered, and there was fre-
quent course duplication. A course
in math, for example, indispen-
sible to many professions, was
often duplicated in each one.

“A major accomplishment of
the Pitt-AID program thus far,”
said Dr. Blaise, “has been to es-
tablish a faculty in the natural
and social sciences to supplement
the work done by the traditional
professional faculties.”

Dr. Blaise is an associate pro-
fessor in the University’s Grad-
uate School of Public and Inter-
national Affairs (GSPIA), an as-
sociate research director of the
Inter-University Research Pro-
gram in Institution Building, and
an associate professor of Educa-.
tional Planning and Development
in the School of Education.

. GERMAN TUTORING

There will be free tutoring in
German every Tuesday, 1 to 3
p.m., in 318 _CL. Any questions

partment, 1617E CL, ext. 493.

  Tri-Beta Honorary

Has Unique Service

By NANCY FUCHS

Beta Beta Beta, national
biological society, is more
than an honorary. Unlike the
majority of honoraries it is
an active service organiza-
tion at the disposal of the
entire University community.

Tri-Beta’s most unique service,
which was developed last fall,
is called a BioPhone. By calling
ext. 322 Sunday from 3 to 5 p.m.
and 7 to-10 p.m, and Tuesday and
Wednesday from 7 to 10 p.m., a
biology student can have his
questions about biology answer-
ed. Upperclass members serve as
operators.

A $200 grant from the Activ-
ities Fee Allocation Committee
has enabled Tri-Beta to acquire
a copy of almost every textbook
used in current biology courses.
According to Tri-Beta historian
Robert Heslop, “The BioPhone
hours are designed to offer assis-
tance at the most ‘common study
hours and on days which usually
preceed probable testing dates.
Therefore, a student in a jam
can receive important tutoring
the night before an exam.”

Tri-Beta also offers a free tu-
toring service on an individual
basis. Ferd Sauer is in charge of
the program. In addition, the or-
ganization will help students who
want a job or would like to do
undergraduate research in the
biology department.

To be tapped to Tri-Beta, a
biology major must have a mini-
mum of 3.0 average in biology.
According to Heslop, however,
this is not the only requirement.
“Prospective tappees are recom-
m nded to membership by pro-

’ -essors and teaching assistants on

the basis of academic excellence
and an acute interest in biology.”

SG Poll
 Completed

The recent poll conducted by
the Study-Survey and Analysis

' Committee, which sought a sam-

ple of student opinion concern-
ing the University calendar, drew
2,200 participants, according to
Mike Ruxin, chairman of the
committee.

Although the recent poll was

directed at undergraduates, grad-

uate students will be polled this

J E . week and the nurses will be poll-

ed Thursday.

Ruxin said the computerized
results, the conclusions of the
committee, and a faculty poll
will be presented to Acting Chan-
cellor David Kurtzman.

He explained that members
are expected to use this society
as a means to extend their know-
ledge and experience in biology
through such programs as under-
graduate research, seminars, tu-
toring, and social events which
serve to elminate the barriers be-
tween faculty and students.”

The organization holds 21 guid-
ance seminar each term in which
notable doctors, biologists, veter-
inarians, public health workers
and others speak on the oppor-
tunities available to biology grad-
uates. . ,

The University chapter of Tri-
Beta annually hosts the District
3 Convention of the organization.
During the convention Tri-Beta
members from most of the col-
leges in the tri-state area and
New York present papers on their

undergraduate research and signi-.

ﬁcant library research. This
year’s convention will be held
next Friday and Saturday.

The University chapter has 45
members and taps once a year in
the winter trimester. The officers
are: president, Jim Barton; vice-
president, Barbara Kostkas; sec-
retary, Joyce Horinka; and treas-
urer, Julian Zekan.

Baseball Prepares

For Season Opener  

By JAY ROSENSTEIN

About this time last year,
coach Bobby Lewis and the

 

     

Regional Gym Title

Gymnast Dave Shidemantle advanced to the NCAA
championships with his ﬁrst place ﬁnish in the longhorse
event in the Eastern Regional tournament at Annapolis,

amt‘-21, .1966‘?

Shidemantle  "

baseball team ﬁgured that
strong pitching and steady
defense would combine to

make a winning season. The
combination did more than that.

It brought the baseball team to

the NCAA regionals. ‘

According to Lewis, this year’s
team “looks just as strong as last
year's. We'll need the key hit to
get a one run lead and then have
the good pitching and defense to
win.

“That’s the type of ball club‘ I
like,” Lewis continued. “One run
games keep everybody on their
toes. The players can’t afford to
relax on defense because one run
is the difference between win-
ning and losing.”

Right now there are 36 players
competing for the 22 spots on the.
squad. “We have to be down to
our set‘22 by the ﬁrst week in
April,” Lewis said. The baseball
team’s ﬁrst game is here on April
9 against Bucknell. ,

In the inﬁeld, Lewis has Torn
Beckett holding down third base
and co-captain Steve Eiseman es-
tablished at second. There are
two candidates for the ﬁrst base,
right-hander Chris Mitchell, who
is recovering from a broken an-
kle and left-handed Tom Smith.

’ Shortstop seems to be the most
hotly contested position. Steve
Kenzl has the inside track be-
cause he played there last year.
But there are two or three others
who are right behind him.

Co-captain Ferd Sauer heads
the outﬁeld corps. Lewis plans to
put him in centerﬁeld. Warren
Sordill will probably get one of
the other spots. He is “probable”
because of a, knee injury that
forced a cartilage operation three
weeks ago. The other outﬁeld
position is wide open with Tom
Stickel heading a list of three
hopefuls.’

When Doug Chambers grad-
uated, he left a defensive tradi-
tion behind the ‘plate. Now four
or ﬁve catchers, including Guy
Busci and Randy Vallentine, hope
to take his place.

Throwing to them will be re-
turning pitchers Paul Helsel and
Don Stock. Lewis feels that he
has the hurlers‘ to handle the
pitching chores. Among them is
lefty Dave Welty.

COACH BOBBY LEWIS
Expects‘ rmotlierr winm'n.g season.
“There are 10 boys throwing
now and we'll keep six or seven
at the most,” he said. “Those six
or seven will get their chance
early in the season to show what
they can do. We play ﬁve games
in ﬁve days on our Southern trip.
That means I’ll need at least four
starters.” '

Lewis isnft sure if the pitch-
ing has caught up to the hitting
yet in the intrasquad contest. He
hopes that the relatively high
scores indicate stronger hitting
rather than unreliable pitching.

Maryland, last Saturday.

Dave McKinnis of the gym team
also qualiﬁed for the champion-
ships at Penn State April 1-2. His
rating of 8.6 put him in a three-
way tie for ﬁfth place in the side
horse event.

Giving his best performance of
the year, Shidemantle impressed
the judges enough for a 9.4 rat-

ing. His other vault was a 9.3. A

Shidemantle now carries the title
he won in the EIGL tournament
(which was held at the. Field
House) and the Regional title into
the nationals.

“I think he has a good chance ‘

to become the national cham-
pion,” said gymnast coach War-
ren Neiger. “His toughest compe-
titon will come from a couple of
kids from California and a boy
from Southern Illinois.”

During the regular season,
Shidemantle never reached the
success he has had in the post
tournaments. “Dave was troubled
with a bad back and then he
jammed his elbow during the
regular season,” Neiger said. Next
year Neiger plans to use his soph-
omore-champion as the all-
around man.

In the regionals,_ McKinnis did

not qualify for the sidehorse, but
“they invited him because of his
good dual meet record,” Neiger
said. In the same breath, the
committee rejected gymnast Jim.
Sacco.
