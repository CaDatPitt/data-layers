Strike Effects e

The friendly skies haven’t been
so friendly over Greater Pitts-
burgh Airport.

A recent report lists Greater
Pitt as suffering larger declines in
service than any other airport in
the United States during the first
six weeks of the air traffic con-
trollers’ strike.

» But an Allegheny County avi-
ation director thinks Greater Pitt
may be able to see clearly now.

“It certainly was a bad six
weeks, but everything seems to
me on the upswing,” said di-
rector David Donahoe.

Following Greater Pitt on the
list of airports suffering the larg-
‘est service cutbacks were Chica-

_ go’s O‘Hare Airport, Philadel-
phia lnternational Airport and '

New York’s LaGuardia Airport,
according to the study by a New
York-based firm.

Paring in Oakland:

  A look at the underside of mobile urban living

By CHRISTINE WILTANGER
Pm i§Jew- smii V‘/riler \ '

Part two to be in Friday’s issue

When Judge James Little sits 

on the bench,!he’s barely visible
except for the top ofghis head.
Hunched down behind an
oblong monstrosity that's
paneled in the same cheap,
brown wood grain as the room‘s
walls and the pillars, he can sur-
vey the people who gathered
before him to plea their cases on
a Thursday night.

\Old ladies toting Giant Eagle
bags sit along the back of the
room, their dirty‘ sweaters
pressed tight against the wood
grain as they knit and watch the

. show.

Respectable working couples;
men in t-shirts and shaggy
beards, looking like theyjust got
off work; women in tight jeans
and heeds. They all sit close

together. waiting for thejudge to“

call his next case, maybe theirs.

“Alma Mulcahy," the judge
calls out. his eyes never leaving
the bench in front of him.

The woman in the_pink rain-
coat from the third row stands up
and walks to the bench. She
hunches her shoulders forward
like some third grader sent to the
principals office. Before she
even gets to the bench, she flips

her right hand in the air.

The judge swears the woman

nothing but the truth, so help

The lady says something, but it,

can’t be heard. No one‘s heard in
traffic court unless he wants to
be. Nothing’s done loudly in
Judge Little’s court-—not the
pleading , not the defense,
nothing. The old ladies in the
back just knitting away, waiting
for something to happen.

The pink lady‘s defense lasts
only a minute. Judge Little hears

-the case and usually reduces the
,fine,“just because they bother to

come down."
There are few cases that the
judge dismisses entirely, espe-
cially from students.

Curriculum
Changes
Proposed

By MARY KANE
Editor 4,-

If you think it's tough fulﬁlling
your College of Arts and Sciences
distribution requirements now,
you’ll have plenty of sympathy for
students enrolling in CAS next
year—they may face stricter foreign
language, writing and math require-
ments if a CAS curriculum reform
committee proposals are adopted by
the faculty at the Faculty ofArts and
Sciences meeting Oct. l0.

The recommendations of the 26-
member committee, which is com-

prised of students and professors, e

have been distributed to faculty
members, as well as to other admin-
istrative offices.

0 Foreign Languages: Instead of
recommending only two years of
foreign language study in high
schools, the committee proposed
that students be recommended to
have three years of study, with an
average grade of C or better.

The successful cjompletion of two
terms of college—level study in a for-
eign language will satisfy this
requirements. Students can also fill
this_ requirement by achieving an
acceptable score on a foreign lan-
guage placement test, or pass a spe-
cial proficiency exam.

“We are, in effect, offering incen-
tives to more serious language study
in the high schools," [the report
read. “We are hopeful that one con-
sequence of this approach will be

improved language instruction» in v

the high schools."
0 Writing: If students do not

achieve adequate score on a diag-‘

nostic test, then they must pass one
composition course beyond basic
writing. All students will also have
to pass a minimum of two "W"
courses, a special disignation of the
English Department, in theirjunior
and senior years, or one course
and one composition course.

“W” courses have a minimum
number of writing assignments. and
students are expected to hand in 20-
24 pages of writing, plus ne)c’essary
revisions, by the end of the course.

0 Math: All students would have
to take entrance tests in mathema-
tics and algebra, or a optional trig-
onometry test. Also all students will
be required to take‘ two math
courses, or, if they display adequate
proficiency in algebra, only one
course. -

The curriculum reform commit-
tee, headed by CAS Dean lrwin
Schulman, was formed 2% years
ago, to study the curriculum and
suggest changes.

“The proposed requirements in
these three areas (writing, mathe-
matics and foreign language) are
really displaced admissions require-
ments, since in the past we had
already assumed that entering stu-
dents already possessed these skills,”
the report said.

Among other recommendations,

the report suggests dividing the nat- I
ural science requirement into life

sciences and natural sciences, requi-
rements. Students would be
required to take a two—course
sequence in a life or physical science,
and one course in a separate scien-
tiﬁc field. ~
The curriculum reform commit-

tee, headed by CAS Dean lrwin '

Schulman, was formed 2'/3 years
38.0. to study the curriculuimand

By SETH UBOVE

Whether or not the proposed
hotel-and—condominium complex
behind the Syria Mosque is built 200
feet from the curb of Bigelow Boule-
vard may not seem like such a big
thing now. but it may be one of the
few ways residents living close to the
site can stop the project.

Otherwise. according to Robert
Lurcott. executive director of the
city planning department. the area is
now zoned institutional. which per-
mits hotels.

And. , Lureott said. "That‘s the
thing that the community has to deal
with." c

In other words. the opposition
the Schenley Farms Civic
Association doesn‘t have many
legal ways of prexcnting the hotel
complex’s construction.

One possible way the civic associ-
ation could stop the project would
be to appear at a hearing on possible
variance changes.

Although a hotel may be con-
structed on the site. certain specifi-
cations required by city law must be
followed by the developer. Beynon
& Co. Realtors. If .the developer
decides to appeal any of the specifi-
cations. such as the size or height of
the building. then the city would
have to schedule hearings to rule on
the variance requests. '

And this is where the civic associa-
tion. headed by Pittsburgh attorney
and Schenley Farms resident P.
Christian Hague. will make its
move.

“We feel that (the developer) can-
not build without getting variances.
and well litigate to stop them from
getting the variances.” Hague said.

But Eduard Smuts. project man-
ager. denied that any variance
changes would be requested.

"Our intention at the moment is

not to request any variance
changes.“ according to Smuts.
Plans for the hotel-and-

condominium complex surfaced last
January when it was learned that
Beynon Land Co.. a subsidiary of
Beynon & Co. Realtors was plan-
ningto developthe 3-acresite forthe
project.

Beynon obtained 99-year leases
on the property. which includes two
parking lots currently used by many
Pitt students and staff. One lot. at
the Syria lvlosque. is located
between Bigelow Boulexard and
Bayard and l._vtton streets. The
other lot. at the Masonic Temple. is
surrounded by Ba_\_ard and Tenn_v-
son streets and is separated from the
Syria Mosque lot by Lytton Street.

More than a year ago. the civic
association tried and failed to get the
Historic Review Commission to
designate the site a historic area.
which would mean that the commis-
sion would have to approve any
construction.

Hague said that the civic associa-
tion’s attempt to have the site desig-
nated a historic area was started

Parking

“I only allow exceptions in two
»instances.” Judge Little say-
s.“One if the car broke down.
and you had to park it off the
street. The other is if it is a medi-
cal emergency.

.“I don‘t listen to anything
about broken meters, or -‘I was
late for class,’ or ‘the prof
wouldn't let me out to put money
in the meter.’ If I did that every
meter in Oakland, in the city‘d be
busted. And I don’t need that,”
he added with a smile.

“Overall," he continues, “I
don't think I hear as many com-
plaints from Oakland as I do
other parts of the city. No more,
no less." . _

Which is unusual if you think
about it. Unusual because Oak-
land has one ofthe worst parking
problems ' in the city of
Pittsburgh.

Forty thousand people come
to Oakland daily: s‘ome.to attend
classes, some to work, some to
visit one of the hospitals, even
though 800 buses run through

Oakland everyday, it seems as if A

most people arrive by car. For
these 40,000 people, there are
I7,899 parking spaces available
on the streets and in the garages.
These l7,899"spaces must accom-
odate 3l,600 students who
attend the University of Pitts-
burgh, Carnegie»-Mellon Uni-
versity and Carlow College.
They must accomodate seven
regional hospitals, which annu--
ally serve an estimated 83,000
inpatients and 790,000 outpa-

c'0nIi'nued_/roni page one

tiems. And they must accomo—
date the I4 percent of the total
Pittsburgh work force that earns
its living in Oakland.

“Parking is so bad in Oak-
land.” says former Oakland
planner Vic Williem," that stu-
dents would rather miss class
than try to find a place to park."

The reason for the situation?
Williem claims its the University
of Pittsburgh.

“The management of any
enterprise should not allow for
growth without looking at its
flanks. And that is exactly what
has been allowed to happen. The
university has been allowed to
expand to the point that there is
no longer any place for students
to go.”

According to Richard Fees of
the city‘s treasury department,
Oakland “has 33 percent of all
the meters in the city, and it gen-
erates more revenue than any-
place else except downtown."

In I980, the city collected over
$500,000 from meters alone,in
Oakland. That doesn’t include
the money received by tickets or
traffic violations.

What do the people who have
to work in Oakland think of the
problem‘? ‘I ‘

“If Gertrude Stein were alive
today, she'd say of Oakland-
,‘there is no parking there,” com-
ments John Mercer, a research
assistant at CMU's School of
Urban and Public Affairs. '

““lt’s really bad, terrible if you

in addition. a faculty member
had dental equipment valued at
$4.000 stolen over the Labor Day
weekend. The police found no
signs of forced entry in the Labor

ters said that one of the "thou-

the thief’s means of entry.

Nikon photography equipment
was stolen from the sixth floor of

Securing A
Residents  

Several years ago, the University of Pittsburgh
made national news—not forits football team or its
academic prowess, but because of the sudden stu-
dent outcry against changes in residence hall visita-
tion rules. The network television news team who
covered the story treated it as a humor piece, but no
one here was laughing.)

The change in the visitation policy was considered
a violation of rights by the dorm residents. The
student’s arguement ran something like this: we’re
adults, in an adult institution of our own choosing. If
we are to be trusted with our education and our
future, we should be allowed to conduct ourselves
and our guests-in an independent manner during our
stay here. The support this argument had partly
cancelled the proposed changes in the policy.

Once again, however, an incident in the residence
halls has put the premise of this argument in doubt.

Over a week ago a Pitt student, who had not been
signed into Brackenridge Hall according to resi-
dence hall regulations, began to spray a fire extin-
guisher near some of the residents of Brackenridge’s
rr.nth floor. The chemicals in the spray could have
seriously damaged the residents’ eyes. ‘ ,

Residents of the floor wrote a letter, printed else-
where in this issue, to the campus police and “sent
additional copies to The Pitt News.

But this action is post facto. The fact still remains
that an unescorted visitor obtained entrance to the
building and nearly blinded several residents. The
truth is that Pitt security cannot be fully responsible
for the thousands of on-campus residents and their
visitors; and, despite the action taken after the fact,
the residents themselves are rather helpless to stop it
as well.

There seem to be , then, two constant facts con-
cerning dormvisitation and security: one, due to size
and population of Pitt, visitor security has inherent
loopholes; and secondly, despite the overwhelming
number of sane students who either live in or visit the

, dorms, a contingent of adolescents still froth at van-

dalism.
Unless -the university's dorm residents can come

up with rational answers to continuing problems

i such as the fire extinguisher incident, the admini-

stration may be forced to act again to secure the
protection of its students. No doubt ~.the student
populace may again rise up, but without evidence to

Dorm InciElent.Sparks Letters

Dear Editor:

As residents of the 9th and l0th
floors in Brackenridge Hall, we feel
that wefmust submit the following
letter to The Pitt News as an indica-

tion of our discontent for the sense-

less acts that seem to occur in
Brackenridge Hall.

The following is a copy of a peti-
tioned letter sent-to the campus
police. Although we may not be
appeased in our,demands as far as
the police are concerned, at least we
feel confident that we have increased
awareness ofthe issue. More impor-
tant, we.have served this warning:

not to mess around with Bracken-‘

ridge Hall. We as residents are tired
of such senseless acts and arewilling

A to do something about it.

Brackenridge Hall
Floors 9 and l0

(Editor's note: This letter was sent
to Campus Police Chief William
Tucker and was signed by 29 resi-
dents ofthe ninth and l0,th/loors of
Brackenridge Hall)

This letter is in regards to an inci-
dent that occurred on the l0th floor
of Brackenridge Hall on Sept. 5,
l98l. A University of Pittsburgh
student was found spraying the floor
fire extinguisher in the hall adjacent
to an authorized floor party in Suite
l0D. The student was reported to be
very boisterous and rowdy by all
persons present.

We are writing with great concern
because‘, by misuse of the fire extin-
guisher, the student placed all those
people who‘were in the hall waiting
for an elevator in great danger
because ofthe chemical nature ofthe

contents” of .the extinguisher. With

this brief review of the incident, we -

hope (the police) will be concerned
enough with this matter that it will
prompt (them) to take some course
of action. By doing this, (the police)
may be able to stop any more inci-
dents such as the above from hap-
pening in the residence halls. T

We hope (the police)-will look into ‘

this matter in depth and answer
some of the following questions:

Was the student legally signed into '

the residence hall by a resident of
Brackenridge Hall‘? And is this

.allowable behavior’ under the uni-

versity rules and regulations con-
cerning dormitory living‘?

Labor And Unrest: Response

Dear Editor:

After reading Mr. Paul LeBlanc‘s
reply to the Labor Day editorial, I
feel a few comments arein order:

Mr. LeBlanc seems to be a
member ofa misdirected minority in
this country. There used to be people
who dismissed any guilt for govern-
mental wrongdoing with the phrase,
“My country, right or wrong." Now
there is another group that seems to
dismiss all possibility ofwrongdoing
by labor. Perhaps they feel justified
in saying, “My union, right or
wrong."

The Vietnam era taught us the real

lesson: that governments can and do .

get out of hand, Perhaps the 805 will
wake people up toithe fact that a
union card does not bring with it a
sainthood.

I wonder if Mr. LeBlanc has ever
toured an Air Route Traffic Control
Center to see firsthand how “stress-
ful” the controller’sjob is. I wonder
if he has ever studied accident statis-
tics to see whether or not his con-
trollers are making mistakes due to
stress. l wonder if he has ever consi-
dered how a $l0,000 raise could
wipe away all this stress. I wonder if
he considers any contract_ legally
binding. If not, I would be interested

to see his reaction if the university
simply decided that he should not be
teaching and unilaterally broke its
agreement with him.

The irrationality of his argument

strikes home most forcibly when he '

contends that we need more
teachers. How can this be the case
when there are fewer and fewer
children in school, due to the declin-
ing birth rate? C‘mon now, that sort
of thinking would have been respon-

sible for an increase in the number of

blacksmiths when the automobile
was becoming popular.

Sources And.Confidences,Ltd.

Dear Editor:

Writing opinion columns can be
difficult work. First the writer must
get an idea, then the writer must
write the story, and finally the poor
soul must deal with the editor and
the production people.

The news writer has an even
tougherjob, for in his (or her)case it
is necessary for sources to be culti-
vated and readily available. That is
not as easy as it sounds. I ought to
know. I used to be a source.

It was just a short stint--nothing
big, nothing dramatic. All it
involved was the detailing of a little
information about a standing com-
mittee of Pitt‘s student government.
The statements I made to a Pitt

be remembered by anyone a week
from now. _
However,‘ despite the lack of
attention that most Pitt students
undoubtedly paid to the story in
which I was mentioned, it is still of
some importance to understand its
background because it is a case
study in how to discourage confi-
dential sources and how to disable a
pewspaper. ‘
’ When l was talking to the Pitt
News reporter on the phone, she was
quite nice and seemed perfectly wil-
ling to keep my identity out of the
article on the student government
standing committee. She did not
mind having to recruit me as a “con-
fidential source." and I did not mind

_ _ . _ News reporter comprised barely a being one. All that changed, how-
support their claims to mature independence, their full paragraph in the article. lnfact, ever. when Monday's paper came
arguments will fall ‘through . , the paragraph prgbably was not out, for it was then that I learned

Obviously I am angry, or else I
would not be venting my spleen in
this column. But there is something
more important at stake than my
anger. There is a need for a quality

vpus, and we all should recognize the

deleterious effect that misguided

issue.)

A Inside Story:

Tradition. lt evokes an image ofa
-picturesque college campus where

there’s an ivy-covered brick building ,

called “Old Main," Friday night pep
rally bonfires. and streets lined with
English Tudor-‘style mansions pass-
ing off as fraternity houses;
Somehow, Pitt, with its urban
environment, does not fit the stereo-
type. This is not to say, however,
that tradition isn't valued here. No.
tradition at Pitt is alive and well.
Growing numbers of Pitt students

are again acquiring a taste for it after -

a long hiatus during those turbulent
years of the late 1960s and early
‘ l970s.

Today, tradition is present in the
way Pitt students dress, act and even
think. Dueiin part to our president
and the Moral Majority, the whole
country isvpaying more attention to
tradition, feeding the same mood on
campus. ’

The Inside Story takes a look at ,

areas in the university where Pitt
students and tradition are playing a
major role.

Back To
Basics

~l‘n l9Q9 P_i_tt dropped its foreign
language requirement because there
was an anti-requirement mood
among students.

ln l98l, a Pitt committee consist-
ing of faculty and students recom-
mended that this requirement along
with several others be added to the
College of Arts and Sciences curric-
ulum program.

“Today’s freshmen are surprised
at how few requirements there are--
they want to attend a university that
knows what it's doing,” said CAS
Dean lrwin Schulman. “I don’!

. think the optimism from l0 years
~ ago of students making wise and

responsible curriculum choices
exists anymore."

According to a survey of several
hundred I97-9 Pitt graduates. stu-
dents would welcome curriculum

‘reforms by a margin of two to one.

A proposal for reforming the cur-
riculum ein CAS will be put to a
faculty vote next month.

A result of a 2% year study. the
proposal also stresses a need for
basic writing skills ‘because. accord-
ing to Schulman.'that was the uni-
versal complaint among faculty.

Schulman would not term the cur-

. riculum reform proposal as getting

back to basics. but rather a way of
“incorporating a balanced. standard

_ structure into the program."

While the proposal is predicted to
be approved with little problem,"

Schulman noted that it comes at a V S

Mime.

s

I

“This is a conservative period and
some _of the proposals called for
require extra money and faculty." he
explained. “Strengthening our writ-
ing program is an example of where
extra money will be needed."

Although students in liberal arts
will loose.some freedom of selection
because of the new core require-
ments, Schulman doubted that
many will complain. ‘

“I would welcome and encourage
students to challenge the proposals.”
he said. “l doubt they will. though. lt
takes a lot to wake or arouse student
interest at this university.”

Pitt students searching for
answers are increasingly turning

back to traditional forms of religion

and religious practices.

“Students today are not interested
in running a collision course against
the establishment, be' itieducation.
religion or government.” said Rabbi
Joseph H. Levine of Pittsburgh’s

"Hillel Foundation. “They are turn-
ing inward and seeking more per-
sonalized. lasting values.”

Levine. who has been with the
foundation for five years." has
observed a dramatic increase in stu-
dent attendance at religious services
as well as renewed interest in the
Holocaust and traditional Jewish
customs.

Both the Lutheran Campus Min-
istry and University Oratorytof the
Holy Spirit Parish report a similar

‘resurgence of interest in traditional
practices.

explained the Rev. Sampsell. head
of the Lutheran Campus Ministry.
“Students want to hear good sermon
and ask questions that get to the
roots’ of our faith."

Levine noted that today’s stu-

dents, in the aftermath ofthe student ’

protests. still want a voice in
decision-making.

“Students are much more articu-
late. and their input is much stronger
than everbefore." he said. “We have
learned from them and the whole

experience of the youth movement

to value student input and to engage
in dialogue." ‘

Campus fellowship groups are
also reaping from this student move-
ment back to tradition. Campus
Crusade had over l50._students sign
up during the recent Activities Fair.

“It is a spiritual" resource for stu-
dents,” said Patty Ricallon. a Pitt
sophomore and fellowship leader.
“We are here for the student’s spirit-
ual guidance.” ‘

The group approaches religion by
“showing people what’s in the Bible
in means that will appeal to them."

Examples of ‘this approach
include lastVyear‘s successful campus
visits by Josh V McDowell, who

enlightened over 2.400 students with A

his intellectual approach to religion.
and Andre Kohle. who explained his
spiritual beliefs during a two-hour
performance.

Clothes

Hillman Library may not be
covered with ivy. but that isn’t stop-

ping a growing number of Pitt stu-

dents from adopting the “preppy
look"lin their dress. " ‘

Clothes such as Oxford shirts with
button-down collars. twill-tailored
trousers and shetland sweaters with
Henly necklines have replaced the
worn jeans and Army jacket attire
popular I0 years ago.

Not only has this resurgence of
traditional dressing revived the sta-
tus of the neat. clean-cut look. but
moreover it reflects a major shift in
attitudes and ideas during the past
decade.

The traditional Protestant work
ethic is now making an impact on
Pttt’s liberal arts majors.

“The trend now is for students in,

liberal arts to minor in a technical
area." said Pitt placement counselor
Joyce Lee. "thereby developing so-
called ‘marketable skills‘ needed in
landing a job."

Statisticsfrom Pitt‘s placement
office indicate that the number of
students interviewing for jobs on
campus has increased a whopping 75
percent during the past six years.

Lee says she has noticed a major
shift to student conservatism. but
she adds that "students are not
choosing alternative life styles
because. with today’s economy.
there‘s a hesitancy to move away
from home. Many starting salaries
are forcing students to live home
longer."

always been present in'a number of

grades are often the determining fac-
tor in starting salaries.

 A Diver-  
sion

Within the next few weeks,
hundreds of freshmen will be vying

_to become part of‘ Pitt’s tradition-

laden “Greek Life.”

The Greek life, comprised of 36
sororities and fraternities, has
become a core element in the univer-
sity’s social tradition and has man-
aged to maintain its popularity

’ throughout several student move-

ments and attitude changes.
Fraternities and sororities offer
social opportunities as well as com-
munity service. Last year during the
highly promoted Greek Week, Pitt’s
fraternities and sororities joined
together to raise over $30,000 for the

_ American Cancer Society.

In light of the current trend
toward tradition, Pitt’s Greek life
should not “expect a shortage in
memberships or opportunities.

Panther football, if not already a
tradition at the university, is on its
way to becoming one.

‘ Thousands of students will make
the trek up Cardiac Hill this season
to see one ofthe nation’s top-ranked
teams in action. This tradition will
be one to watch in coming years as

Pitt continues to win and to recruit _

some of the country‘s top high
school athletes.

Apathy

Has student apathy. rather than

'g;3,_.;€tudcnt involvement. become part of

Pitt tradition‘?
The question is a timely one.'espe-

ﬂﬂciially if students are to have a voice
«(in the .crucia7l‘"changes that will‘bc

 

made in theuniversity. system during

the next 10 years.

Hundreds of Pitt students join
various clubs and organizations
each -year, but the unifying element
of student involvement in university
politics is the Student Government
Board.

According to SGB President Bill
Abraham, one of the board’s goals
this fall will be the improvement of
communications between student
organizations.

“A greater sense of community
can be enhanced by improving the
communications among student
organizations,” he said. “We should
facilitate our communication
because we have many of the same
goals."

Facilitating goals aside, the last

, time students showed any real sense

‘of student involvement came during
last April’s commencement ceremo-
nies. Over 40 black students stood
and turned their backs in protest
while U. N. ’ Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick delivered the dom-
mencement address.

Although the dorm visitation pol-
icy became a major issue during last
year's SGB elections, the plans that
included massive sign-in violations
and a demonstration march never
got off the drawing board.

lfdorm visitation, which caused a

major uproar among students less ,

than two years ago, can die that fast.
how much chance is there for less
controversial issues, such as curricu-
lum reform or program cuts, to draw
student support?

Tomorrow  

Pitt is not unique in its political
apathy, for many U.S. colleges amd
universities report the same
problem.

What does make Pitt unique,
however is that it was suffering from
this same problemduring the fall of
1968--the same time most universi-
ties were heavily into the student
political movement. As Dean Schul-
man said, “It takes a lot to wake up
this student body."

The current bout with student
apathy at Pitt and otheruniversities
has often been compared to the
apathy ofcollege generations during
the l950s,.who earned themselves
the title of “The Silent Generation."

But present political activists
Generation." ”

 

But present political activists,
should not despair, because many
observers predict that, after four or

.even eight years of Reagan in the

White House, apathy will be
replaced by widespread political
involvement.

However if the counterculture
continues along with the neat. pre-
dictable patterns of tradition, one
can‘t help but wonder who or what
tomorrow’s beatniks will be.

Cincinnati Coach Mike Gottfried has retained his sense of humor despite his team’s
two miserable performances this season. The Bearcats lost their opener to Youngstown . _
State and last week Penn State whipped them 52-0. T

m‘Whatam I doing here?’
Gottfried Grins ,Bears it

By JOHNETTE HOWARD‘
Sports Editor I

Like a good joke at a funeral, Cin-
cinnati Bearcat Coach Mike Gott-
fried‘s approach to Saturdays
football game with the Pitt Panthers
reeks a sense of comic relief.

, The Uiiiversity ofCincinnati pres-

&_' ent, a man named Henry Winkler,
somehow last December lured
Gottfried away fromia winning col-
lege football program to take the
reins of the mighty Bearcats,
winners four times in their last 22
games. i ‘

All Gottfried did walk away from
was a lifetime contract at Murray
State, the team he coached to {the
I979 NCAA Division l-AA
to coach Cincinnati’s current slap-
stick outfit, which has lost its first
two games this year. First came a
fourth-quarter collapse and I9-I3
loss to Youngstown State, followed
by last week’s 52-0 laugher against

Qenn State. '

“I guess the next question is,
‘What am I doing here,’ " Gottfried
said during a telephone hookup at
yesterday’s Pitt Football press con-
ference. “lt’s the challenge. I had the
lifetime contract, but I figured you
only go around life once.“ —

Right now, Gottfried isjust tryin
to get the Cincinnati program to
turn the corner. The early—season
losses haven’t helped his young
team’s psyche. '

The contest against the Panthers

r~ Saturday “is a very difficult game for

Skis. morale-wise. We’re down right

?',.*,‘>wl.“ Gottfried admitted. “The

 tfiing we don‘t have right now is con-
fidence. But with the stage our pro»
gram is in we have to go out and
learn. each week the hard way."

Omitting the opener against
Youngstown State, the Bearcat
schedule hasn’t been too accommo-
dating to Gottfried, whose team
after Saturday will have faced Penn
State and Pitt on consecutive week-
ends. He said he's still “looking for
the guy who made up the schedule.”
Beforethe Penn State game, Gott-
fried said. ‘‘I‘m going to call the
Pennsylvania governor and see if]
can Bela Stay of execution." This
week his outlook is similarly
gloomy.

“I told my team the only thing
that‘s going to change this week is
the uniforms," Gottfried joked. “It's

like we’re playing ping-pong in
Pennsylvania one guy gets us, then
the other."

And guess who keeps getting
slapped around.

To avoid a repeat of last week’s
fiasco. Gottfried said hegand his staff

will “change some things around
for the Pitt game, especially on
defense.

The Bearcats have switched‘to a
“wide tackle six" defense this year, a
holdover from Gottfi’ied’s days at
Murray State. The alignment puts
eight players on the line of scrim-
mage, creating a myriad ofdifferent
looks and stunts for the opposing
offense. The system is usually a good
test of an offense'§ reading ability
and one-on-one blocking skills.

Last week against Penn State, the
Bearcat defense. although riddled
for 52 points. p1‘ovided one of the
team’s few bright spots by getting to
Penn State quarterback Todd
Blackledge six times.

Though the “wide tackle six“ can
be strong against the run, it is
vulnerable against the pass. as the
Panthers well know. Last year‘

Women’s tennis

By MARIE HUFF
Pm News Sportswrvler

Pitt women‘s tennis coach
George Dieffenbach and the
Lady Panthers have two ques-
tion marks looming over their
heads, question marks which
may be bigger than the outcome
of their upcoming match against
cross-town rival Duquesne Wed-
nesday afternoon. One question
is the status of senior Lisa Wein-
berg, the No. 3 player in the 5-4
loss to West Liberty.

“I believe Lisa has left the
team," was all Dieffenbach
would say. He had much more to
say about the squad’s second
question mark, Aldene Lacaria,
a former non-scholarship
member of the Pitt track team.

“Right now, we’re trying to
prove that Aldene did not partic-
ipate in any track events in
1978,” explained Dieffenbach. lf
Pitt succeeds in proving that,
Lacaria, a fifth-year senior, will
have one more year of eligibility
in college athletics.

Dieffenbach hopes to have
everything straightened out with
Pitt and various committees of
the Association for Intercolle-
giate Athletics for Women by
Wednesday; he could then insert
Lacaria into the No. 3 position
vacated by Weinberg.

Randi Belkin and Cathy Jac-
obson will play the one and two
slots, respectively. The two will
also team to be the No. l doubles
team for the Lady Panthers.

With Lacaria in the No.3 posi-
tion, Dieffenbach plans to use
freshman Miriam Goltz in the
fourth slot, and sophomores
Jody Mattioli and Jan Castory in
the five and six positions, respec-
tively. Dieffenbach also intends
to use Lacaria and Goltz as the
No. 2 doubles team, with Matti-
oli and Castory forming the third
team.

However, a wrench could be
thrown into those plans if Laca-
ria were declared ineligible.

“We shouldn’t have too much
trouble if Aldene can play," pre-
dicted Dieffenbach. “The going
may be a little rougher ifshe can’t
though.”

If Lacaria remains ineligible
and Weinberg gone for the sea-
son, Dieffenbach could have

another big headache—-depth.
“I don't like to think about it,”

said Dieffenbach. “We’ve had
good weather for practice, our
timing and shots are coming
around, and we have no injury
problems.”

The Pitt News, Wednesday, September 16, 1981 M i

By MARIE HUFF

PM News Sportswrnter

Rookie coach Cindy DiGiacomo
and the l98l edition of the Lady
Panther field hockey team will make
their debuts tomorrow afternoon at
West Virginia Wesleyan University.
The Lady Panthers will have the
rough task of trying to improve on
last year’s 7-2 campaign, the best
record in the team’s history. Last
year also marked the first time the
squad participated in postseason
play.

This year, however, Pitt will be

. starting perhaps its youngest team

ever, with six freshman breaking
into the starting lineup.

“We’ve definitely got the talent,”
said a confident DiGiacomo. “Right
now we’re working on playing as a
unit."

The Lady Panthers have switched
from a 3-3-3 alignment to a 4-2-3 this
year, a big part ofthe reason DiGia-
como cited “playing as a unit” as a
key concern right now. In the 4-2-3,
four women play the front line while
only two play the link.

Margie Hall will be the lone vete-
ran on the front line. Hall certainly

has all the credentials to anchor the
line—she was last year‘s top scorer.

“Margie, Sue Shaheen and Dee
Dee Kantner give this team the lead-
ership it desperately needs." said
DiGiacomo.

Junior Colleen Ahern and sopho-
more Betsy Kauffman are expected
to split the goaltending duties.
Laura Rau, a transfer student from
East Stroudsburg, rounds out the
list of starters having previous
college-level experience.

The youngsters taking the field for
DiGiacomo on Thursday afternoon
include sweeper Jessica Black. half-
backs Stella Volpe, Debbie Madera
and Terry Zygarowicz and wings
Phyllis Kusuplos and Karen Olsen.

According to DiGiacomo, the
squad is looking better every day at
practice.

“They're a determined, enthusias-
tic group,” said DiGiacomo. “lfm
really anxious to get the season
started and to see what we can do. It
should be a successful season.”

The Lady Panther home opener
will be next Thursday, Sept. 24,
against Slippery Rock State
College.

against Maryland‘s “wide tackle
six,” the Panthers rolled for 38
points and 383 total yards, including
293 yards in the air.

Pitt flanker Dwight Collins
exploded that day against Mary-
land, hauling down three touch-
down passes, including a 51-yarder.
But Pitt may have lost Collins for
some time yesterday when the
sophomore severely re-injured his
left hamstring while runninga sprint
in practice. The trainer’s diagnosis,
pending an examination by team
physician Richard Ray, was a torn
hamstring; which could sideline Col-
lins for up to wo months. Collins
was oncrutches after practice.

The loss of Collins could set the
Pitt offense leaping backwards and
will probably prevent the team from
implementing some new wrinkles
right away, like the four-receiver
offense Coach Jackie Sherrill talked
about after the Pitt—lllinois game.
Against Cincinnati, Sherrill said
yesterday, the Pitt passing game
should figure prominently.

“(The wide tackle six) opens up
the passing game. When a team puts
eight men on the line of scrimmage,
you‘ve got to try to put the ball in the
air,” Sherill said. “The rush cuts
down on your passing package---
you can’t throw five people out on a
pattern, but
things."

Wide open, ifthe Penn State game
is any indication. And Gottfried
knows it. 8

‘‘We’re just going to try to stay
alive.” he said. ‘ ‘

granted,” he said. “That’s why I gave
Zemanski the ‘Unsung Hero’ award
his senior year. He’s an unselfish
player, who supports all his team-
mates. He‘s an example to the other
players." 4

Pitt Coach Leo Bemis sees many
of the same fine points in Zemanski.

“Zemanski has earned his playing

time,” he said. “He’s in good shape"

and he came to play.”

Bemis will need Zemanski’s good
defensive play when the Panther
boaters head into their game today
with St. Vincent College. Bemis will
be looking for another win and more
consistent attacking.

“We’ve been playing with inten-
sity,” said Bemis. “But we still need
more scoring.”

St.~ Vincent has a I-0-I record,
beating Geneva in their opener and
tying Mercyhurst I-I last Saturday.
Pitt was victorious last year over St.
Vincent 5-2. '

St. Vincent is a scrappy team.”
said Bemis. “They’re improving and
are very‘aggressive, with good ball
skills. It’s on their home field and‘
they’ll be out to beat us. They're
going to be tough.”

Zemanski is confident that the
Pitt squad will continue their win-
ning ways. '

“We've settled down and we’re
communicating on the field,” he
said. “We should do well today. If
we beat St. Vincent, it will get us’
ready for Slippery Rock on Friday.”

Zemanski isjust glad to be playing
collegiate soccer, and wants to con-
tinue doing what he can to extend
the Pan_ther’s early—season success.

“I want to keep up my confidence
and contribute my best to the team,”
he said. ’w I

By playing aggressively and with
great intensity,_the Pitt soccer team
can have a winning season. By play-
ing as well as he has,"Dan Zemanski
will help the team and perhaps even
get himself noticed. .
