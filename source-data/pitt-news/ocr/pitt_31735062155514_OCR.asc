1   POINT SCALE 

 

SYSTEM   

Council Approves New 
Effective Sept... 1930

 

The Univers-ity Council approved
the new system of quality points

reweighing the quality point scale?
system at the regular meeting of?
held“ last
Friday noon. This plan will go into
-‘effect for the class entering Sept_.,
1930, and does not affect students
now enrolled in the University.
Whereas the old scale of quality
points made “A” worth 3 points;
uB,u 2; C,» 1; “D,” 0’ and uF’n 
the new systemof quality points is:
“A”. equals 7 quality points.-
“B_” equals 5 quality points.
“C”‘ equals 4 quality points.
“D” equals 3 quality points.
“F’? equals 0 quality points.

In accordance with the -new plan,
the number‘ of points required for:

points as a graduation-requirement;
the new plan in the same proportion
speciﬁes -450 quality points.-

This change in the quality point
scale was made after careful study

reweighing the quality point system
so that the quality points might
more nearly correlate with the
grade distribution of the past three
years in«the classes of the under-
graduate schools in the University.

The committee further proposed
that the present plan for grade dis-'
tribution be studied and that the
number of “A” grades should con-
formf more closely to the percentage
recommended in the University bul-
letins. ’

The members of the committee
for reweighing the quality point
scale system are: Walter B. Jones,
research professor of education,
chairman;_ H. E. Dyche, professor
and head of the dept. of electrical
engineering; 0.iH. Blackwood, pro-
fessor of physics; M. C. Elmer, pro-
fessor and head of the dept. of so-
ciology; “M. K. McKay, professor of

Pessimistic Pittites M ust
Find Another Worry—No
Tuition Raise Coming

“A raise in tuition hasn’t
even been considered by the
University administration” is.
the answer‘ J. Steele Gow, dean
of administration, -gave when
questioned this week by the
Pitt Weekly concerning a rumor
which has been noised about the
campus.

Dean Gow was unable to ex-
plain how ‘such a rumor could
have originated at this time.
It appears that each year a
group of students become wor-
ried about the ever-present
menace of a raise in tuition,
just because the administration ~
has the power to boost fees if
it becomes necessary.

Pessimistic Pittites need not
worry about a tuition raise for
another year for Dean Gow’s
statement officially explodes
the rumor.

‘made; no promises but said, she
felt conﬁdent. that -next year’s-
alumnae spring nieeting may be
held in,a ﬁnished room of the C’a~__
thcdral. ,
A business meeting‘ was held pre-
ceding the t ‘, Nell Mclienry, '23,

standing loans of. $1879.61, and that
the Educa.tional‘Fund has to -its
credit ‘$1777.78, income of which is
used to buy books for the alumnae

February 24, for alumnae-’: who have
“children, for a lecture on child psy-
chology, by Dr. Florence M. Tea-
garden, ’14, of the University. fac-
ulty. Since the meeting. was some-

‘ what of an experiment no attem t

was made to solicit all the -eligible
alumnae but the enthusiastic ire-
plies that were received to the tel-
ephone, invitations foretold the suc-
cess of the meeting‘. . -, e
The next Theeting arranged xby
this group is scheduled. for. Mon:

tails
Similar groups will be organized
among the alumnae as demand. is
rnaxle upon the secretary. Inform-.
al request has already been made

So again Marlatt steps up to ‘the

p A test of the power. of student council on the Pitt caiupus  to be V"
‘made soon. Council. recently’ passed a motion demanding the publica-_
 tion board admit the present editor and business manager of eachgpgba-< .

 lication when the candidates forgnextl year .. are disc'ussed' and selected.

The editors and business-managers are-, to attend a1l,.»sessions- of the
publication board but are to have no vote. The ’publication”..board, fap.

pointed by the dean of adm_inistration, consists of the dean" of V1ncx_1,.»t_he 0, VA
has of the department of journalism anC1_the.,graduate manager of..a¢.-m 

tivities. . . . ».
Within a.. few weeks this publication board will meet and make its
selection of oﬁlcers for next year. . But whether the present editors and

business’ managers will sit in on all sessions. and be present} when-the ‘ A '

votes are’ taltenis doubtful. .
. Perhaps the members of the publication board will agree‘ with stu-
dent council and admit the students. But the board may object and de-
mand’ a. secret session. In thateevent student council will probably ﬁle
an objection with the dean of administration whoappoints. the publica:

tion board. Then it will be "in thobands of the dean.’ of administration -

to decide whether student council‘ can dictate cdncerning work. and ‘c‘.on‘~
duct of faculty boards. in C ‘ ‘ ' * 

At present members of s‘tudentrcouncil= are not aware of ‘the extent
of_ their jurisdiction. -It appears that the council can do anything"-it—d_‘_o+

It was established in 1918
when
bequeathed $50,000 to provide a
chair in the interest of civic govern-
ment.’ 0 , =

The trustees arranged that the in-

contle from this bequest be used to

provide . two ' research fellowships,
one in the department of. history
and one in the department of politi-
cal science.“ Persons holding. these
fellowships. pursue research work. in
these departmentstand make‘ a spe-
cial, study of the pioneer history;
municipal, technological and scien-
tiﬁc, that has occurred in the Pitts-
burgh district and Western Penn-
sylvania. .
C One Year

These fellowships are granted for
“a period of one year and ‘include a
stipend of $1,000 along with exemp-
tion from tuition. I The fellowships
this year were granted. to William
Park Hotchkiss, A. B., and Raymond
Stanley Short, A.M.;‘in history and
political science, respectively. ‘

. Summer Fellowships .

In 1926 a number of summer fel-
lowships were established. These
fellowships, extended to one faculty
member from each of a “designated
group;o£- colleges of Western Penn-

sylvania,” include a stipend of $150.

and remission of tuition _,for study
during the summer.’ ’ . ‘ W

The University extends these fel-
lowships to Grove Cit ', Thiel, Seton
Hill, Westminster, A legheny, Gen-
evaand Washington and Jeﬁerson.

. These particular colleges were se-

lected because‘ of the close contacts
the University maintains. with them.

These contacts are made steadfast‘

through the medium of University
protessorswho conduct lecture tours

' through these schools -during the

-Dr. Herrick pointed out that

with the real and the unreal.‘ but
that this idea, so well expressedhby

V-— .Th_o. method used was to present
in 1d-ialoguc speeches of the charac-

acteristic of 0’Neil’s works, the play
lacks humor. but it abounds in high-
ly dramatic and exciting .-scenes.

Interlude” popular withthe public,
however. Herrick said. is-the drama-
of repression fth_.at is , prominent.
throughout the entire play. Dr. I-Ier;

As to going‘ to college, Murphy N’
told me  that he ‘planned ’ to go

BEING AIM OF
Pll"l BUREAU

Gathering Facts And Business
V Research Is Work--Manley

Gathering facts and conducting
business research with the ultimate

object of improving the future eco-‘

nomic well-being of the Pittsburgh
district and the people who live in
it, is the work of the bureau of
business research, according to ‘Dean
Louis K. Manley of the ‘school of
business administration.

The Buhl Foundation's gift of
$250,000 and the additional appro-
priations of the University provide
funds for carrying on the bureau’s
work. Eventually, it is hoped, the

bureau will render a service for

Pittsburgh district commerce simi-
lar to that which the Mellon Insti-
tute renders the industrial science.
Analyze Conditions

A regional survey of the various
phases of J.-’ittsburgh’s economic ac-
tivity is being conducted. The com-
plete program is brieﬂy as follows:
Collection of data in ﬁelds of busi-
ness and industrial activity in Pitts-
burgh and national data of interest
to Pittsburgh and analysis o£_this
data; analysis of opportunity for
diversiﬁcation and for new enter-
prises, analysis of changing busi-
ness .conditions with emphasis upon
the forecasting of cyclical changes,
creation of better technique for the
development of the common interests
of the area of which Pittsburghis
the natural business and industrial
center; publication of currentand
special ﬁndings in order that civic

organizations, business men, and in-»

dustries may have the truth and
data impartially with a. view to-
wards improved co-operative action;
provision of an accurate, well
equipped, impartial and complete
clearing house of facts for quick
reference; provision for an adequate
laboratory for business research;
and the collection and analysis of
facts relating to unemployment with
the expectation of bringing about
greater stability of employment
with its consequent beneﬁt to the
local economic structure.

All these aims and objects are in-
terlocked in most of the studies un-
der way at present. These include
employment and unemployment con-
ducted by Mr. S. W. Wilcox, pro-
fessor in statistics; Mrs. E. M.
Tufts and Mrs. Josephine McLaugh-
lin; the diversiﬁcation of industry
conducted by Mr. Glenn E. Mc-
Laughlin, assistant professor in
statistics; trade, transportation and
farm marketing conducted by Mr.
Emmett H. Welch, instructor in sta-
tistics; Miss Frances L. Gibson and
Miss Katherine D. Dorrance, and
ﬁnance and taxation conducted by
Mr. Wilbert G. Fritz, instructor in
statistics. Dr. John H. Cover is di-
rector of the bureau. Dr. Wesley
Mitchell, director of the national
bureau of economic research, and
Colonel Leonard Ayres, vice presi-
dent of the Cleveland Trust Com-
pany, are advisers.

Work Perpetual

The work of the bureau of busi-
ness research is practically contin-
uous. Business studies and business
research data is constantly accumu-
lated. The bureau seeks to discov-
er what industries could most proﬁt-
ably be located in Pittsburgh, and
the near surrounding district in
view of the raw materials available
here, transportation facilities, taxa-
tion, power and numerous other
factors.

Bureau of Business Research

Most of the research so far has
dealt with the facts relating to un-
employment, in‘dustrial diversiﬁca-
tion. in the Pittsburgh district, and
Pittsburgh’s transportation facili-
ties. The bureau is the fact ﬁnding
body for those interested in the wel-
fare and advancement of the Pitts-
burgh district. .

A report of the ﬁndingsfor the
ﬁrst calendar year of the regional
survey will probably be made public
in July this year according to Dean
Manley. ‘

A THICK RIBBON

_If all sidewalks on campus were
laid end to end, how far would they
reach? .Mr. “Gus” Bentz, campus
caretaker, says that if such an oper-
atiionwere possible, a concrete rib-
bon nearly ﬁve miles in length would
result. And who should know bet-
ter than he, for he has been oﬁicial
campus caretaker for twenty-two
years?
