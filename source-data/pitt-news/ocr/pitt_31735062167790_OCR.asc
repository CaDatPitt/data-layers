Students expecting refunds on their PHEAA scholarships must
plan their budgets along with the Pennsylvania State Legislature. Ac-
cording to Charles Dees. Jr. recent replacement for Miss Marian Bon-
ney as director of Student Aid. the hands of the University are tied until
Harrisburg makes good on its promises.

Although
honored state scholarship holders
for Fall and Winter terms. it has
done so on the assumption that the
appropriations would be forth-
coming.

While the scholarship bill is
presently in position for final pass-
ing in Harrisburg. no funds have
as yet been forwarded to the Uni-
versity. As a result. the Universi-
ty has been forced to borrow mon-

Although the University has
honored state scholarship holders
for Fall and Winter terms. it has
done so on the assumption that the
appropriations would be forth_—
coming.

While the scholarship bill is
presently in position for final pass-
ing in Harrisburg. no funds have
as yet been forwarded to the Uni-
versity. As a result. the Universi-
ty has been forced to borrow mon-
ey on an 8.5 per cent interest rate
to cover operating costs.

Other universities and colleges '

in the state have attacked their fi-
nancial plight by demanding pay-
ment from scholarship recipients
before grades were issued or final
examinations were scheduled, but
Dees affirmed that the University
will not take that step.

However. it will not issue re-
funds to students whose scholar-
ships include University awards.
which are nonrefundable. Tran-
slated into specifics. this means
that a student holding $363 in
aid from PHEAA and $100 from
the University will receive his
$100 excess when the state comes
through since only PHEAA mon-
ey is refundable.

The 6000 students now enjoying

 aid benefits draw funds from four

sources. The monies are allocated
from the University budget. fed-
eral programs and state scholar-
ships and loans. Gift endowments
provide a fourth pool of funds. but
usually are subject to the restric-
tions of the donors.

The new director, in office for
a week, plans to make these
sources more readily accessible
to students through increased us-
age of University news services.

Dees also intends to adhere
more strictly to scholarship re-
quest deadlines now scheduled on
March 15 for the Fall term and
Nov. 1 for Winter. Former direc-
tor of Student Aid for Point ‘Park
College. the youthful admimstra-

the University has

tor stressed that he will initiate
an open door policy for students
who are confused as to their schol-
arship status.

Although Miss Bonney is step-
ping down from the position of di-
rector. she will continue to work
with the Office as special consul-
tant for student aid. Coordinating
federal aid programs. Miss Bon-
ney,,,joins a staff of five as an as-
sistant director. Her experience
in the office will further facilitate
her function of liason with the
health professions.

A W5 Demands

Explanation

In light of the recent contro-
‘versy over the purchase of the
Christmas tree in the Student
Union. the Associated Women
Students took action this week
demanding a public explana-
tion for the purchase of the
tree.

The Associations General
Council unanimously resolved
that "the recent action of the
Student Union in its purchase
of a $1350 Christmas tree is in
poor judgment and calls for some
type of public explanation to stu-
dents. faculty. and administra-
tors."

The AWS resolution cites the
following reasons for demand-
ing explanation by the Union:
(1) The University is current-
ly in the midst of financial
problems and student organiza-
tions are operating on limited
budgets from allocations; <2»
The decision to purchase the
tree was made without student
consultation or knowledge:
and (3) Student research has
found that attractive artificial
trees may be purchased at a
much more reasonable cost.

In other action, the Council
also passed a resolution involv-
ing Phase I of the Forbes Field
complex, while rejecting a
proposal to rename the Towers.

With regards to the Forbes
Field complex. AWS proposed
that "whereas the Phase I of
the Forbes development calls
only for development of less
than one-half of the total land area
of Forbes Field for at least a
five year period and whereas
the lower campus area is with-
out park and recreational fac-
ilities within a reasonable walk-
ing distance. the land area of
Forbes Field be appropriated for
a park and recreation. area until
the time comes for its use in
further phases of the Forbes
Development.“

(Editor’s Note: The following was
released by the Governor's Office in
Harrisburg on Dec. 10.)

Almost 70.000 full and part-
time students at Pennsylvanias
13 state-owned colleges and In-
diana University were given a new
voice in the official affairs of their
schools by Governor Raymond P.
Shafer.

As part of his Administrations
efforts to involve young people in
State Government decision-mak-
ing that affects their lives. Shafer
named the 14 elected student body
presidents of the schools to serve
as "advisory" members of the
Board of Trustees on each cam-
pus.

The appointments were made
at ceremonies in the Governors
Reception Room. Two weeks ago.
the Governor named the first
group of youth advisors to posts
on boards and committees that
help set policy in the Department
of Public Welfare.

Pennyslvania‘is_ the first state
to carry out such a broad program
of youth appointments.

Shafer said the appointments of
the student body presidents are
"among the most important acts
I have performed as Governor.
For today. we are breaking down
one of the barriers that has made
many of our students feel disen-
franchised on their campuses.

N ew-Pros

"We are giving the students a
voice on the policy-inaking body
that governs their schools."

Shafer said that the “advisory”
membership entitles the student
body president to participate in all
the deliberations of the Board of
Trustees at each school. Becuase
the Boards are established by law,
the student representative will not
be authorized to register an offi-
cial vote on final decisions of the
Board, unless the law is changed
by the General Assembly.

"Naming student body presi-
dents to this new position is most
appropriate.“ Shafer said. "be-
cause they are democratically
chosen by the students themselves.

"Although some of these young
people do not have long to serve in
their present terms. I felt it im-
portant that they now be named to
their new roles. This also will
serve notice on all the students
that their next president will serve
as their elected voice on the Board
of Trustees. ‘

“I am personally convinced that
these appointments are badly
needed to help establish a new era
of student-administration relation-
ship on our campuses.

“As you all know. I have been
making visits to Pennsylvania col-
lege campuses to listen and talk
to students. I have learned. And
one important thing I have learn-

Atvrtitirtg

Demand Acceptmtce

(Editor's Note: An in-depth
follow-up report will appear
in the next issue of The Pitt
News.)

A group of “non-professional"
workers in the health. education.
and welfare fields in Pittsburgh
and Allegheny County demand-
ed December 16 that the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh give them
the educational opportunities
they need to leav dead-end jobs
and succeed as “new profes-
sionals“.

The group. about 150 mem-
bers of the New Professional
Association of Allegheny County,
or New-Pros. marched on Chan-
cellor Wesley W. Posvar’s office.
New-Pro chairman Mrs. Reeble

Marshall said that her group
represents about 900 health,
education. and welfare agency

workers who. are not college
trained but who work with
college-trained social workers
in their jobs. ~~

The workers said they would
await word from the Univer-
sity that the following demands
are accepted :$a

- That the University give
them the chance to continue
their education with scholar-
ship aid. a special curriculum.
credit for work and life ex-
periencc. and other assistance. .

- That the University help
agencies and institutions devel-
op programs to enable non-
professionals to advance in
their jobs.

- That the University “certify“
that certain jobs are now filled
by non-professionals really don‘t
require college degrees.

The New-Pros contend they
often are denied advancement
because they do not have the edu-
cational qualifications to do the
jobs they have been doing all
along. According to Mrs. Mar-
shall, many of the New-Pros
were taken off welfare to work
in poverty programs here, and
they don’t want to go back on
welfare rolls.

Chancellor Posvar and Dr.
Jerome Schneewind. Dean of
the College of Arts and Sciences,
said after the meeting that they
are unable to act upon the third
demand. but are willing to move
on the other points.

Both men said that the Uni-
versity is prepared to start in
January to take_30 to 40 non-
professionals who have had
some college experience and
begin working with them in the
college of Arts and Sciences

L and School of Education. .

ed is that there is not enough com-
munication in many instances be-
tween student and administration.
Consequently. there is misunder-
standing. often mistrust. with sub-
sequent polarization of views."

After making the appointments.
Shafer traveled to Bloomsburg
State College for a campus visit
with students there. It was his
fourth campus visit in this school
year.

“Many in my generation say
the students should not have a
voice in the policy-making affairs
of colleges. They suggest a hard
line. I cannot agree, anymore
than I can agree with student mil-
itants who claim some inalienable
right to do what they please and
flaunt the rules we ourselves must
make to preserve an orderly so-
ciety. _

"We must make way for a new
democratic blend in governing of

-our society. And there is no better ‘
place to begin than on our college

campuses. V

"That‘s what we are attempt-
ing to begin here today."

The Governor said he was ex-
tremely pleased that the Boards
of Trustees of the State schools
are in agreement with the plan.

"Last Friday.
Committee of the Association of
Trustees of the Pennsylvania
State College met at Slippery
Rock State College and adopted
the following resolution:

“'In accordance with the sug- A

gestion of Governor Raymond P.
Shafer that our Association give
consideration to an appropriate
plan to involve students in an ad-
visory capacity in the administra-
tion of State Colleges. it is hereby
resolved that the duly elected
presidents of the student govern-
ments in each_State College be ap-
pointed by the Governor as Youth
Advisors to the administrations
and Boards of Trustees.’

“This is evidence that construc-
tive change can be worked through
those of us who are so often re-
ferred to as the so-called ‘Estab-
lishment.’

Reporter's Note:

Former Vice-Chancellor of

4 _Student Affairs, Jack Critchfield,
_ has been cited as saying, “When

we can't answer a student ques-
tion, we throw the problem

a back in their lap.” The members

of the administration, faculty, and
Board of Trustees were recently

asked to explain their attitudes
P toward the problems of Student

Government.

The following article summar-
izes how they perceive our poli-
tical structure and the inconsist-
aincies between the representa-
tive voice sent to them Student
Government members and the
voices to which they listen, Stu-
dent Affairs Advisory Committee.

‘ While they did not offer any sug-

gestions for improving our politi-
cal structure, they did reveal how
they look at us.

The Committee on University
Governance began meeting last
term to facilitate communica-
tion between members of the
student body. the faculty. admin-
istration, and Board of Trustees.

This committee was originally
established as an advisory body
to the study on University govern-
ance being conducted by Dr.
Holbert Carroll of the Political
Science Department. Since that
time it has expanded its purpose
as follows:

To suggest areas of study to
Dr. Carroll.

To determine problems in the
current governance of the Uni-
versity.

To initiate immediate action
for dealing with these problems.

In a recent meeting of the
Committee on University Govern-
ance. the discussion focused on
the problems of Student Govern-
ment (SG) The administrative
and faculty members on the
committee brought to light their
ideas on the current problems as
they see them.

The
made 2

following points were

*The administration and faculty
committees have difficulty ac-
cepting the representatives select-
ed by SG spokesmen for student
opinion because the SG Senate
does not appear to be a truly
representative body.

*In many instances the Student
Affairs Advisory Committee
(SAAC), is looked upon as the
spokesman for student opinion.
The SAAC is composed of the
presidents of major campus or-

*While aware of the SG Senate‘s
current intentions to restructure
(before the upcoming elections).
a strong stand was taken that the
upcoming elections for SG Presi-
dent be held under the current
constitution. Any new proposal
to restructure SG should follow
the amendment procedure de-
tailed in the current constitution.

*’Students must be careful to
ensure representative selection
of students on faculty and ad-
ministrative committees. As the
University Senate considers
plans for expanding student rep-
resentation on its committees,
some members of the faculty
that the proposal would not
pass since many faculty mem-
bers are dissatisfied with the
current student selection mech-
anism.

These comments followed the
presentation”'iof a proposal for
student participants on all Board
of Trustees committees. William
Rea. the chairman of the Board.
felt it would be disadvantageous
to appoint permanent student
committee members chosen by
Student Government. He suggest-
ed that students attend these com-
mittee meetings on the basis of
a student‘s interest in a particu-
lar topic on the committees
agenda. It was not clear who
would select the student repre-
sentatives. ‘

The discussion of the pro-
posal centered around the issue
of "Is Student Government rep-
resentative in its current form?"

niversity Expansion

When talking about Phase I and Phase II. the Universitys fu-
ure plansifor the land which is now occupied by Forbes Field. one
should not forget for one minute the most important issue involv-
ed: the University is growing. and the surrounding community is
shrinking.

Although the University is not the sole culprit (City planners
are just as guilty), members of the community of Oakland must
receive first priority when the use of newly acquiredland is dis-

. When Forbes Field is torn down. the citizens of Oakland
will loose many things much more important to them than memo-
-tries of‘Past Pirate teams. Many adults and teens will loose full or
jpart-“time jobs. Snack shops. parking lots. restaurants. gas stations.
ﬁnd bars will suffer from lack ofcustomers from April to October.
The majority of‘ people in Oakland will suffer either directly or
‘indirectly when Forbes Field goes. As the new owner of this land.
the.Un-iversity must assume responsibility to the citizens of Oak-
‘and. — ‘

Thus, when students speak of using the land for a recreational
urpose (see story to right), they must include the fact that all
av-cilities should be for public use. Petitions should be signed for
a recreational facility open to all the residents of Oakland. not
just the University residents. ‘

 In addition to recreational facilities. the University must
also take all steps possible torinsure other benefits are available for
"ts neighbors. Such items as more jobs: free use of all University
acilities, including free course work; and the utilization of mem-
ers of the Oakland community on all University planning com-
mittees mustbe considered for our neighbors.

Fsrbes Phase I

   

  An Asphalt Jungle?

by MARTHA HARTLE
Pres., A.W.S. Elizabeth Rock,
Pres., Women’s Housing Board
GARY SCHAFER, Pres., MDC

Despite the current inactivity with the Three
Rivers Stadium construction. it is almost a cer-
tainty that the University-owned Forbes Field
landmark will be demolished in the spring and
construction for the Forbes Phasejl development
on campus will begin.

Included in Phase I of the Forbes complex
will be the new law school. social science com-

‘plex. school of education and -graduate school

of library and information sciences. Phase I is
scheduled to be completed within a five year
period. Following its completion.
will move onto Phase II of the development.
Phase II. however. is at least five years inthe
future. .

The Phase I complex will encompass ap-
proximately less than one-half of the total
land area of Forbes Field. The majority of what
is now the playing field area will be untouched
by the first five year development. With this
land available only temporarily. we feel it can
best be put touse as a recreation. park and
playing area for the lower campus.'We cite the
following reasons for our position:

(1) There are presently no
facilities available on‘the lower campus. This
lack offacilities affects the commuting stu-
dent as well as the dormitory resident. Presently.

the commuter with a few hours between classes
or the dorm student who wants to kill a few hours
must journey to Schenley Park or up Cardiac
Hill. The Student Union and Cathedral lawns
were certainly not designed for park and recre-
ational purposes.

:2) It has been suggested that the available
land area in Forbes Field be asphalted and used
for parking. Due to the critical parking problem
in the area. this may sound like a reasonable
suggestion. But financially. it may be unwise.
Sincethe area will remain available for only a
short time. the cost of asphalting could hardly
‘be justified. It mustalso be taken into consider-
ation that a parking lot with over 300 available
spaces was opened at the «beginning of the fall
term and the demand for the spaces has not

recreation would be minimal--since the area is
currently designed for that purpose.

Final appropriation of the Forbes Field land
area will.-be made within the next few weeks.
Petitions are currently being circulated among
students. faculty and staff; the administration has
been made aware of student opinion on this is-
sue. We also hope that final blue prints for the
entire Forbes Field complex will provide for
some type of permanent park area with perhaps
a fountain. a few trees or a little grass. Lets not

Shafer’s New Aaivisors

by jerry gruebel
associate editor

The Governor seems to feel.

student voting members. one

When Governor Raymond P.
Shafer appointed 14 student ad-
visors to state-owned college
Boards of Trustees. he claimed to
be defying the generation gap.
The.Governor is full of "you
know what." _

"Many in my generation say
the students should not have a
voice in the policy-making affairs
of colleges. They suggest a hard
line. I cannot agree.“

But how much of a voice did
the Governor give the newly
appointed student advisors from
Pennsylvanias 13 state-owned
colleges and Indiana University
when‘ they can't even vote‘?

Governor Shafer's explanation
is that the Boards of Trustees are
established by law. and because
of this the student representa-
tive will not be authorized to
register an official vote on final
decisions of the Board. unless the
law is changed by the General

Assembly.

however. that the appointments
of the student body presidents -are
"among the most important acts
I have performed as Governor."
He said that the appointments
entitle student representatives to
participate in .. all the delivera-
tions of the Board of Trustees at
each school.

But the Governor knows very
well that "participation" and
no vote means no participation.
Pardon the mistrust. but I'm will-
ing to bet that the Board of/Trust-
ees members at the 14 state-owned

colleges are no different than

Chairman ' of the University's
Board of Trustees William Rea
and his thirty—three other co-
horts. The concerned students
and faculty at the University
learned very well what Rea‘s

definition of participation is —

Even if.as a Shafer Adminis-
tration official claimed. an amend-
ment. to state law was being

thirty members is as good as
no vote.

The appointments are also
pure tokenism just be definition.
One student participant. with
or without a vote. negates the
alleged democratic intention of
the Governors action. Some
70.000 full and part-time stu-
dents minus 14 student presi-
dents at the 13 state-owned col-
leges and Indiana University
are still kept out of touch with
the decision-making processes
of their respective schools.

Governor Shafer‘s iron-rich
tokenism also brings to mind
the state-related institutions of
higher learning within the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
One has to wonder‘ why the Gov-
ernor ignored the University
Temple. and Penn State? My
guess is that the Governor didn't
think the larger state-related uni-

versities would fall for his trickvh

scheme.

Reasons For Tuition Increases

by BOB GING

Staff Writer
In the last three years. the University has
experienced increases in tuition three times.
Juniors and seniors will remember that in 1967
the tuition was only $450 a year. Last year the

tuition was raised fift_v dollars a term. and this i
fall. tuition ran at $361 a term for in state

students.‘ Prices f'or out of state students have
been similarly increased in the past three years.

The funny thing about these tuition in-
creases is that‘ the percentage of increase has
far outstripped the yearly percentage of infla-
tion. Obviously. inflation is not the cause for
tuition increases. The causes for these yearly

tuition increases can be found in the .state legis-'

lature in Harrisburg. and here at home. in our
Board of Trustees.

In the legislature. state scholarships have
been cut. and attempts made to abolish them.
while tuition goes up. Ironically. while the
scholarships are taken away. the legislature
feels comfortable to give themselves a generous
salary increase. One draws the obvious conclu-
sion. 'that. while students are having more and
more trouble making ends meet. someone is
getting fat in Harrisburg.

By slowly decreasing aid to the University.
and increasing the burden on the students.
the state legislature hasldone a great job under-
mining the future ‘of Pennsylvania. The higher
the cost of an eduica-tion- becomes.

the fewer

are the people who will be able to obtain one.
If the tuition gets much higher. many students
who come to the University because it is rela-
tively inexpensive now. will be forced to re-
sign.

"Another reason for the recent outrageous
increases is the leghargyi which characterizes
our Board of Trustees. This body is responsible
for raising funds for the University. or so we
have been told by our ever-honest administra-
tion. and judging by the current financial
crisis. they have failed in this responsibility.
State Senator Robert Fleming. who is a mem-
ber of our Board of Trustees. has been one of
the main champions of high tuition. and lower
scholarships. It seems odd. that‘a man who is
supposed to be helping the University has done
so much that is detremental to the body he is
supposed to aid.

Once again. the buck has been passed to the
group most affected. but least interested. the
student body. As in the past. we have allowed
both the administration and the legislature to

run roughshod over us. proving again. whose
University this really is. Wouldn't you be
amazed. fellow students. if we could all get

together and write to our state representatives
and senators‘? Wouldn’t you be even more
amazed fellow students. if we all refused to pay
future tuition increases. until the quality of our
education was increased also‘?

U1’1i0I1 Statemﬁﬂt Union Out On. /lLimi

On New Tree

(Editor's Note: The following is a
news release from John R. Loch, di-
rector of the Union.)

Since the erection and decora-
tion of the Christmas tree in the
main lobby of the Pitt Student Un-
ion on Friday. Dec. 5. 1969. cer-
tain questions have been raised by
students and others concerning
the cost. appearance. and safety
of the tree. During the fall term a
memorandum was received from
the Office of the Vice-Chancellor
-for Finance which indicated that
no‘ live trees would be permitted
in University buildings due to a
change in the City of Pittsburgh
Fire and Safety Code. The memo-
randum indicated that artificial
trees would be permitted. and that
orders for such should be process-
ed through the Purchasing Depart-

ment of Central Services. The Un-

ion Director’s Office. through the
Union director. proceeded to in-
vestigate various types and
sources of artificial Christmas
trees available which would meet
the specifications: (a) 16 feet.
(bl include a stand. (C) blue
spruce. to continue the tradition.
(dl storage ‘containers to be pro-
vided. and (e) fireproof or flame-
proof. In addition‘. a requirement
which -guided the selection of the
tree was that the tree should be an
attractive tree since it stands in
the lobby of the Union which
serves as a hospitality center for
many holiday functions.

The major factors involved in
the cost of the tree relate to the
fact that a 16-foot tree is custom-
made since trees of the regular or
commercial variety available do
not exceed ten feet. In addition a
blue spruce tree was chosen be-
cause the Christmas tree in the
Union has been a blue spruce since
the initiation of the “Trim the
Tree Party." which was establish-
ed approximately six years ago.
thereby increasing the cost.

In selecting the artificial tree.
which was provided by Gidas Flor-
ists. a cost analysis was provided
which indicated that each year
the Union expended approximate-
ly $200 for procurement. erection.
and removal of the live tree. The
life of the artificial tree is esti-
mated to be’ ten to 15 years.

With this life expectancy. it is
possible for the Union to save over
a ten-to—15-year period between
$650 and $1.650. With this long-
range savings in mind. it was de-
termined that a high quality tree.
meeting the specifications and
providing the life expectancy de-
sired. would be ordered. The or-
der was placed by the Union direc-
tor on October 30. 1969.

Certain problems have arisen

fillment of the specifications as

turer failed to provide limbs which
would bring branches of the tree
to the base of the stand. The ven-

   

vide the necessary fullness and
understood diameter of 612 to 7
feet at the base of the tree.

In light of the fact that the life
expectancy of the tree ranges be-
tween ten and 15 years. resulting
in a substantial savings in the
range of $650 to $1.650. and
the fact that the tree. when the
modifications are made. will meet
all standards and“ specifications
established by the Union Direc-
tor‘s Office. it is felt that the tree

will be satisfactory and in the long-

run economical.

It was especially felt that since
the Union serves as a hospitality
center for the campus that a
large. attractive tree should be
located in the Union.

The funds for the purchaseof
the tree were expended from the
University budget allocated for
equipment in the Union. Funds for
tree were not expended from Un-
ion program or campus activities
fees.

With the University in the midst
of financial problems. we quest-
ion the priorities of the Student
Union in its recent-purchase of a

"$1.350 tree untrimmed even.

First of all. the mere cost of $1.-
350 for a treeis astonishing. What
is it made of? What does it do‘?
Student research has disclosed
that attractive. artificial trees up
to 16 feet tall may be purchased
for much less. Our tree is a blue
spruce. for "tradition" called for
a blue spruce. Yet. whose “tradi-
tion" called for a blue spruce. Yet.
whose "tradition" is this? The
purchasers‘? In addition. blue
spruce is the most expensive tree
to make. Only the best for Pitt——at
any price.

Those involved in the decision
to purchase the tree felt that such
a move would make‘ it possible for
the Union to save between $650-
1.650 over a ten-to-15 year period.
How is this possible when you con-

sider storage and set-up costs of

over“$400 every year to bring out
the beautiful blue spruce. Now
then. $400 over a 15 year period
amounts to $6.000 in maintenance
costs. not includingthe ever-ris-

ing costs in union labor. Tree-e-
inendous. isn‘t it‘?

Upon inquiry into this limby
subject. we were told that a com-
mittee of 40 students were involv-
ed in the decisionto purchase the
tree. These students supposedly
sought such a tree for their tradi-
tional “Trim the Tree Party" and
approved of this cost. But. upon
further investigation. we discov-
ered that NO students were in-
volved in the final decision for
purchase of our lovely tree. The
tree was purchased for the stu-
dents. yet the students had no say
in its purchase. WHY?

Now. we like Christmas trees
as much as anyone else. But. our
concern lies a little deeper. With
the rising costs of room and board.
the shortageiof scholarship and
loan funds. and the limited bud-
gets available to the majority of
student organizations. we wonder
why the Student Union has such
funds available to throw around
on such an extravagance as a $1.-
350 tree.

Long live the tree! We‘re stuck I
with it now. But we are'question-
ing why one department in the.
University has the money and

‘freedom to spend at will and

whim, whereas other departments
and student organizations are beg-
ging for funds.
merits with limited funds include
most academic. growth and ex-
pansion. and community projects.

In the future. we hope to see more 7

funds allocated to these latter

areas and more people, maybe

students even. involved in the A
Student Union programming and
decision-making——not just one per-

son. _
And that about locks it up. —

cuts and revisions by the director '

who wishes to stress certain
themes above others.

The play takes two minor char-
acters of Shakespeare’s Hamlet
and places them in the center of

the work. In and around these two’

‘jattendant lords” swirls the great

drama which is taking place at

Elsinore. Rosencrantz and Guild-
denstern are shown as being
thrust into a series of dramatic
events which they do not not un-
derstand and cannot control, not
unlike the situation most of us are
in today. Stoppard’s conception of
these two characters and their

development in the action shows“

remarkable insight and imagina-
tion. Their fateful destinies, seem-
ingly unrelated to anything they
may have done to warrant their
deaths, is a true commentary on
the nature of “tragedy in our
time.” .
Yet the author himself asks that
the comic elements. which are
many. should be dominant through
the play. recalling again the com-
bination of farce and horror which
prevailed in Marat/Sade.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Are Dead was awarded the.prize
as the best play of the year by the

‘ New York Drama Critics’ Circle

in 1967. Its productions at the
National Theatre in London and on
Broadway received wide acclaim.
Harold Hobson. the critic of the
London Times, calls it “the most
important event in the British pro-
fessional theatre of the last nine
years. . . . Its ingenuity is stupen-
dous. and the delicacy and com-
plexity of its plot are handled with

an astonishing theatrical mas-

tery."

D ’s Spin Black Side Discs

by DON. MARBURY
News Editor

University students are going
to be subjected to something en-
tirely new to Pitt this year. in the
way of radio programming. Be-
ginning this Tuesday on the cam-
pus radio station WPGH. there
will be a new everyday format ini-
tiated, which will include programs
coming of the auspices of the
Black Side of WPGH.

der of the station termed "the
kind of music that Black people
can relate to on this campus."

Wilson. a senior speech and the—
ater arts transfer student from
Central State College. said the
idea for the station came to him
as he sat in the Student Union lis-
tening to WPGH last term.

“I just felt that some of the mu-
sic being played on the station,”
he related. “should come from a

Black perspective and from Black
people.

Wilson also said that most of
the- types of music that WPGH
pla_yed and considered hits. most
of the Black student population
did not. He said he also saw a need
to give Black students a chance to
do something for Black folks.

Thomas Whittaker. a sopho-
more political science major and
an assistant engineer for the
Black Side. reiterated most of Wil-

son's feelings saying. "When a
Black person sits down to listen
to music for some relaxation he
wants to know that he is going to
hear some soul. the type of music
he most readily relates to. and not
just hope that‘ there might be an
occasional soul song sprinkled in
with a lot of others."

The Black Side is planned as an
almost completely separate part
of WPGH. and will be headed by
Wilson as general manager,
though the shows will be incorpor-
ated into the daily program sched-
uling.

Wilson said that he is not limit-
ing his dj's to only the playing of
Black records. and that his only
requirement for them is that they
play six of the records from his
selected top 40 list. and the rest
of the music is up to each individ-
ual-disc jockey.

The station will have its own
news. sports and special features.
all focusing on the Black commun-
ity and student population.

James Catlin, junior aero-
space engineering major and chief
engineer for the station, empha-
sized that the training that he re-
ceived and the knowledge of tech-
nical aspects of a radio station
were invaluable to him. “The sta-
tion was finally my chance to do
something relevant at the Univer-
sity,” he said.

Wilson related some of - the
structure of the station saying that
it would concentrate on: rock and
roll. "funky” music. like that of
blues performers Jimmy Reed
and .Muddy Waters. jazz. music
by African artists. Black history
and on Sunday mornings. a sprit-
ual show.

"Every Tuesday evening." he
continued. "were going to have a
special telephone show. where
students /can call in and air any
type of gripes they have." He also

AN ORIGINAL SCULPTURE, symbolizing the spirit of people in urban renewal, has been unveiled in Pittsburgh.

' Titled “Joy of Life,” the steel sculpture is by Virgil D. Cantini, well known Pittsburgh artist.

The sculpture, located in the 254-acre East Liberty Renewal Area, at the corner of the Penn and Highland
Malls, depicts a circle of people, heads uplifted, joined together with outstretched arms.

ln describing the work, Mr. Cantini said: ‘‘I had in mind the theme of brotherhood. l decided that as we
confront the problems we face as a society, we need to look to people for their solution. Sol chose to do it for peo-
ple. If we survive and move ahead, we must do it together. The sculpture symbolires the new community of East
Liberty working together.”

At present, Mr. Cantini is professor and chairman of the Studio Arts Department of the University, where
he received a master's degree. He has traveled extensively and studied iri Europe. His works have been exhibited
locally, nationally and internationally. -

lf{idl’s Jungle Cats Host
G. Washington Colonials

by ED CONLEY
Associate Sports Editor

A lot of things have been said about collegiate basketball
officials because of the poor road records that most round-

ball squads possess. The officials may not be the major reason for
the Panthers lack-luster 1-6 mark. but Coach Buzz Ridl‘s squad

will be glad to come home after

.a1osing five big games on the

road.

The hoopsters make their of-
ficial home debut tomorrow
night when they host George
Washington in ‘a Field House
game that is scheduled for
9p.m.

The closest the Panthers have
come to -playing a home game
was last December when they

grabbed third place in the Steel

Bowl Tournament at the Civic
Arena. Watching those games.
however. made it apparent that
the Panthers weren't really at
home playing on the Duquesne
Dukes’ court.

M “You have -to be real strong

~ to win on the road,” Ridl said.
“There is really only a small
percentage of winning on the
road.

“It's not just the Pi_ttsburgh
teams who have trouble. Almost
all schools have trouble winning
on the road." A

Wayne Dobbs has had a little
difficulty with his team on the
courts this winter. too. The
Colonials carried a 4-7 record

into their match against cross-
town rival Georgetown last
night.

George "Washington’s perfor- I

mance was also marred by play-
ing onthe road during most of
December, but Ridl doesn’t
think the Colonials will lose
tomorrow simply because they’ll
be on the road. ‘
"I hope playing at home will
be a lift“ for us'..'7 he said. “But
that‘s’7on‘ly- avsrnall part of it.
You still have to play good ball."
The man that has been play-
ing good ball all season along
for the Colonials could make the
Panthers feel like gracious
hosts. He is Mike Ta1lent,. 3
6-1 guard who finished second
to his brother Bob’ Tallent in
scoring last year. and paces
G.W. this winter.
Len Baltimore, a 6-6 sopho-
"more forward, has also been

‘ one of the bright spots in what

is thus far a disappointing sea-

son for Dobbs’ cagers who
started last year with a 6-0
mark,

The Panthers‘ startmlast win-
ter. like the entire season. was

just as poor as the current be-
ginning. Ridl can see some im-
provement in the teams play
over that of a year ago. though.

Without a few injuries and
physical difficulties the cagers
might have been able to stay
with a few teams.

The" biggest loss has been
Cleveland Edwards. The 5-10
star from Robert Morris has
been in-and-out of the line-

up for various reasons during
the short season all ready.

Throughout thePanthers’ last four contests, Coach Buzz .
Ridl must have felt as though he had been facing a snow-

storm in the middle of July.

Tuesday night’s 84-73 loss to William & Mary proved no

different than the three previous games. Several key frigid spells-‘

blemished the hopes of a close nip-and-tuck confrontation.

Despite William & Marys
65 per cent field goal average.
Coach Ridl believed that his
squad conceivably could have
mastered the splendid opponent.

Ridl remarked, “They hada
fairly good team, but we were

sporadic. There was one “spurt..-

where we were outscored .15-2.
That hurt our chances to stay
in the game.” ’

For the initial six minutes.
both squads could count their
baskets on the right hand of a

single player. The score with
14 :04 "remaining in the half
was just 8-8. Within the next

ten minutes the hoopsters had

gained a one point <25-24>
advantage over the hosting
rivals. This occurred when Mike
Caldwell hit forward Mike

Coach Adams was well pleas-

Freshmen. “They are young but
good. They made tactical mis-
takes but made up for them and

they showed a lot of poise,”
he remarked.

In the 28-7 trouncing of
Eastern Michigan. the matmen
showed themselves to be "a

to Coach Adams. "We made
them wrestle more our style."
he stated.

Bud Smeltz aided the victory
with a decisive win over East-
ern Michigans John Wood with

“It was a big match for him,”
explained coach Adams, “Woods
was one of their better boys
and his loss snapped them
morally.”

Coach Adams was unsure of
his squads condition early in
the season. However. the pre-
vacation matches proved that
the team was in good shape for
this time of the season. "It
turned out that we were in
superior condition.“ stated the
coach.

Adams attributes the success
of his team mostly to attitude.
He also‘believes that his new
assistant. Dick Slutzky. was
instrumental.

“Coach Slutzky made a big
improvement in the team. He
has made his presence felt,”
stated Adams.

A brief announcement from the University of Tennes-
see Athletic Department was almost completely over-
looked during the holidays because of the excitement over
the bowl games. The news wasn’t very important, but it
was of some interest to Panther followers.

The Volunteer publicists revealed a hom-and-home
football hook-up with the Jungle Dats, the first game being
played in 1982 and a second one scheduled for 1984.

I .didn’t think about the future frays until I remembered

‘ a gift my four-year-old cousin received for Christmas.

The gift was a football uniform.

The outfit caused a series of manipulations by my
unmathematical mind that resulted in the realization that
Little David would be old enough to play for either of the
teams in the 1984 game. So would any other four-year-

I bid youth of today.

If David were to become a Panther football player,
the game he will play probably won’t be the same event
that weare used to. To begin with there won’t be any has-
sles over the top honors in the country. A brilliant system
will be dscovered and a “Collegiate Super Bowl” will be
played after about a 15-week regular season.

Running in two mile event
will be Mike Nolan. Greg Rod-
gers. Rich Taylor and either
Aiken or Ken Balkey. Taylor is
the only freshman to have cur-
rently broken into the line-up.
Banner explains that the great
depth on the squad this season.
especially in the middle dis-
tances. has made it extremely

try tonight. “Jerry's running
very. very well.“ Banner com-
mented.

Salter is also in top shape
and will be out to better his
6’l0” jump. “Salter is a little be-
hind in his timing because of
football season,” explained the
coach. “He cleared 6’l1” in
practice the other day but tipped
the bar on the way down. In two
weeks he’ll be very sharp.”

Salter will be in a field which  ~

includes four or five jumpers who
have cleared seven feet.

With the two-week lay-off
over the holidays. the thinclads
have had only a week to pre-
pare for their first meet. yet
Banner is very pleased with
their progress to date. "The boys

The rules will probably change quite a bit in the next

tempt. No longer will a team be faced with a possible re-
ward like the one Missouri obtained when its 3-point try
from the 42-yard-line went awry and landed on the Penn
State 7 in The Orange Bowl, putting the Lions in poor field
position. All missed field goal efforts will give the oppo-
sition possession on the twenty-yard line if they can’t re-
turn the kicks. A S I

That’s just one change to expect; many more will
occur. You still say no? Well, do you remember when the
only thing a team did after a touchdown was attempt a
KICKED extra point, or when the clock did not stop after
first downs?

Little David will be going against something else that
may seem strange to us when he faces the Volunteers in
1984. Let’s say that he is on the Panther offensive line.
He stares across the line and is eye—to-eye with the top
defensive tackle in the nation, Mean Josephine Greene.

You still laugh? Go ahead, but there are female foot-
ball players today, you know. And if George Orwell can

talk about a “Big Brother” in 1984 I can talk about some-

, Mermen Set ToBattle Bucknell Ne
As Gra11tBoasts Stron

|;

by JERRY MYERS

Coach Bill Grant is back and the swim team is ready to
take on a new season of opponents, battling in their first con-
test against the mermen of Bucknell tomorrow at the Buck-

nell pool..-

"Bucknell will be very tough." cautioned Coach Grant. "but
we're a lot stronger than last year.“ It all depends on how Buck-
nell maneuvers their freestylers. It’ll be like a game of catrand
mouse." It promises to be a little different from 1969.

The squad doesn't enjoy re-
miniscing about last year's mass-
acre at the hands of the swim-
mers from Bucknell. The final
score read 72-41 and the only
thing the home team had to
cheer about was the flawless
diving of Dave Wessel. Wessel
broke two school records in the
one and three meter diving
events and set a new trees Pool
record inthe three meter com-
petition.

As in last year’s ‘splashing’
Bucknell will rely very heavily
on its ability to capture the all
important freestyle events to-
morrow. Their top freestyler,
according to Coach Grant, is
Greg Olson, who is backed up
by a boy named Landis and
another named Slick. ~

The Panthers‘ strength is more
diversified and lies in the free-
style swimming of Rick Rowe.
the backstroke swimming

Cubs

When opportunity came knock-
ing Wednesday night at Youngs-
town. the Panther Cubs didn‘t re-
spond. Instead. the Youngstown
JVs bowled over Tim Grgurich‘s
Cubs. 86-72.

At halftime. the Cubs trailed by
a mere basket; then with just
minutes remaining in the away
tussle. the Cubs had fought their
Ohio rivals to a 64-64 deadlock.

"We had the chances to go
ahead. The game was tied a cou-
ple of times. but we couldn’t take
advantage of the breaks; we miss-
ed a lot of easy shots." mentioned
Grgurich.

of

/

Marc Cohen and the breast-
stroke swimming of Al Morris.
Dave Anderson heads the butter-
fly contingent» and of course
Dave Wessel is back in top form
to take on the diving chores.

Coach Grant. who has only
been back with the squad since
Monday. is very impressed with
the way they look at the outset
of this season. He attributes the
team’s increased strength to the
fact that he can now depend on
a whole host of “back up swim-

mers. That is. second men who

can get out there and score for
us.” Grant re-emphasized the
fact that “the whole meet will
depend on how Bucknell uses
their freestylers." ‘

The swim team has a new
addition to their coaching staff
in assistant coach Richard Brad-
shaw. Coach Grant is very happy
to have Bradshaw helping out

Take 2nd

The statistics prove Grgurich’s
point; the Cubs took 80 shots and
grabbed 62 rebounds, and yet the
Cubs only tossed two more field
goals through the hoop than did
the Youngstown JVs. In addition,
the Cubs connected on only six of
18 free throw attempts. On the

‘other hand Youngstown swished

24 of 35 attempts.

Grgurich added. "We shou1d‘ve
won. We had ‘em. and when you
get 17 assists and 62 rebounds you
shouldn't lose. Also. we didn‘t
make the free throws when we
needed them; we missed several,
important one-and-one free throw
situations.“

with the squad and feels that he_

-will make a valuable contribu-

tion to the team. “We’re very
fortunate to have him,” Grant
confided.

The mermen will battle their
first four meets on the road
against Bucknell, West Virginia.
Penn State, and Temple before
coming home on February 7
to meet Maryland. Coach Brad-
shaw feels that the squad has
a good chance to ‘win up to five
or six of the nine meets they
have scheduled before the
Eastern Finals in mid-March.

Joining the team after a very
successful season on the fresh-
men squad will be no less
than fourteen sophomores. These
second-year men make up the
heart of the
back-up men that Coach Grant
was talking about. Also avail-
able for’ duty (although not in
the Bucknell meet 8 tomorrow)
will be a host of Freshmen.

Since Coach Grant took over
the swimming team ‘a few years
ago, its skill and depth has
been gradually improving to
the point where they appear to
have the ability to finish with
a winning campaign. Their
challengebegins tomorro.

Loss

Grgurich didn‘t turn complete-
ly sour in the aftermath of the de-
feat. however. He stated that Carl
Morris and Bill Sulkowski dis-
played “big league performances

_ on offense." Morris accounted for

23 rebounds and 22 points and
Sulkowski grabbed 18 rebounds
and hit for 23 points.

Andy Phillips, a walk-on guard,
aggravated the opponents and im-
pressed his coach with six re-
bounds, four asists, five deflec-
tions, and four steals. Overall,
Phillips and fellow guards Don
Wilson and Don Ashbaugh contri-
buted 15 assists to the Cub attack.

A Quaker
Was asked,
“For Whom

does the
bell toll? ”

“And who cares? Three bil-
lion people. 146 countries.
228 religions. Five races. Too
much. Too different. How
far can tolerance stretch?”
The Quaker answered, “For-
get tolerance. Every one of
those three billion shares one
thing with you. He’s human.
So by definition we share
most things in common. We
love, we hurt, we think, we
hunger, we die. And when
one of us is hurt, it opens
the way for all of us to be.
For whom does the bell toll‘?

_ It tolls for thee.”

The world is
so crowded that. . .

we live closer than ever to
each other. Friends believe
“God hath made of one blood
all nations of men for to dwell
on all the face of the earth.”
That makes for a pretty big
family. But, then, look how
many brother’s keepers we
could all have. If we’d try.

Friends feel that if they share
the light of God with all men,
they should hold out a hand
to those in whom it may not
be easily visible—the down-
and-outers, the ones out of the
mainstream of a prosperous
society.

Once there were only monster
computers that did big batch
jobs like payrolls.

Then came the whirling
dervishes of time sharing that

let a lot of people work at once.

Now there’s a new kind of
creature that does time sharing
and batch work together. So
lots of people can use it—
efficiently.

lt's the Spectra 70/46.The
Octoputer.There’s nothing
else quite like it on earth

or under the sea.

The Octoputer’s arms are long
and strong. lt sits in the
middle of your company and
reaches helping hands out in
all directions. Suddenly, your
company works harder. More
of your people use the com-
puter—solving more problems,
finding more facts, writing
more programs.

And it does your big batch
jobs in its spare time.

The Octoputer does a real
armload of work for a hand-
ful of change. Check the

bills from your time-

See if it's not more efficient to
do the same work on your own

Octoputer. And get batch

processing, too. One It can keep you ahead
