Men, Women Deans Staffs Combine

Critchfield Named

Assistant Chancellor

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
announced this week that the
University will combine its sep-
arate dean of men’s and dean of
women’s staffs into a single dean
of students office.

Dr. Posvar said that Jack B.
Critchfield, who is presently Dean
of Student Affairs, will become
Assistant Chancellor for Student
Affairs and Ronald N. Pease,
presently director of student af-
fairsplanning, will take over the
new post of Dean o-f Students.

Miss Savina Skewis, presently
Dean of Women, will serve as as-
sociate dean of students, and Mr.
Herbert McGibbeny, present Dean
of Men, will beco-me assistant
dean of students. Mr. McGibbeny,
who will devote most of his time
to counseling, also will have ini-
tial respons-ibility for carrying
out a major study of ho-w com-
muting students may be more
fully integrated into campus life.

The reorganization and ap-
pointments are effective May 1.

The combined staffs will oc-
cupy office space on the Cathe-
dral of Learning’s twelfth floor,
presently used by the Dean of
Women's staff.

The move “is in keeping with
the most modern practices of stu-
dent affairs organization. It elim-
inates an unnecessary separation
and duplication of student affairs
activities, and it will permit us

  

JACK B. CRITCHFIELD
Assistant Chancellor
for Student Affairs

to better coordinate our living
and learning programs for all stu-
dents,” said Dr. Posvar.

Earlier this year, Dr. Posvar
announced the formation of a
combined housing office to han-
dle both men‘s and women’s on-
and off-campus housing. The of-
fice, which initially will be re-
sponsible to the dean of students,
is headed by Mr. David W. Gine-
van. Dr. Posvar also announced
today that the housing office
would take over the business man-
agement of universitfy owned
housing, assuming that responsi-
bility from the Office of Auxili-
ary Enterprises. Mr. Donovan
Hughes, the associate director of
Auxiliary Enterprises, will be
transferred to the student affairs
staff for this purpose.

 

Pease Becomes.

Dean of Students

The post of Director of Student
Affairs Planning, presently held
by Mr. Pease, will be assumed by
Mr. John Vrana, present assistant
to the Dean of Student Affairs.

Under the new arrangement,
the Assistant Chancellor for Stu-
dent Affairs will be responsible
for the university housing, place-
ment, student aid and admissions
offices, the dean of students, the
director of the student union, the
director of student affairs plan-
ning, and the director of the uni-
versity counseling center.

In explaining the new structure
of the Dean of Students’ office,
Mr. Critchfield said:

“The staff of the Dean of Stu-_

dents will include an associate
dean and a number of assistant
deans who will be responsible for
the implementation of a major
advising and counseling program,
as well as a number of other
programs. Among these others
are the full integration of the
commuting student into the uni-
versity community; more effec-
tive advising for 160 student
organizations, including student
publications; fraternity and so-ror-
ity supervision; and the involve-
ment of all members of the Dean
of Student’s staff in the prob-
lems of undergraduates in order
to preserve the student’s sens-e of
personal identity in the univers-
ity.”

Students For McCarthy,Announce
Their Support of Robert Kennedy

The following is a statement
presented to The Pitt News by
Students for McCarthy:

We the leadership of Students
for McCarthy announce the for-
mation of Pitt Students for Ken-
nedy. We do this now because we
believe that we must state clear-
ly our preference for Robert F.
Kennedy. He has provided us
with the most forceful and intel-
ligent approach to the major is-
ues which confront this nation.
He has demonstrated his concern
for the urban problems, for the
problems that divide black and
white. We believe that Senator
Kennedy has articulated most
clearly and wisely the alterna-
tives available in the search for
peace in Vietnam. This is topped
by our conviction that Robert
Kennedy is the most likely of the
two men to win both the Demo-
cratic nomination and the presi-
dency in November.

It is not our intention to alien-
ate or antagonize the local Citi-
zens for McCarthy who are striv-
ing with us to achieve the goals
of peace at home and abroad.
Many of us have actively worked
in the campaign for Eugene Mc-
Carthy to express our anti-war
and anti-Johnson sentiments.

 

  

Nineteen of the twenty-two stu-
dent leaders of the Students for
McCarthy, which numbers 400,
have voted to create Students for
Kennedy. All of us still believe
that to further the candidacy of
Robert Kennedy, anti-Johnson
delegates must be elected; there-
fore, some of us will continue to
work through Citizens for Me-
Carthy to elect these delegates.

Others feel that the best way

we can. support Sen. Kennedy at
this time is to work for him in
the forthcoming primary in In-
diana.

We believe that Robert Kenne-
dy is the most qualified man to
serve as President. We, as Pitt
Students for Kennedy, will de-
vote our energies and efforts to
organizing students throughout
Allegheny County for his election
in the fall.

University Students Must
Retain Identification Cards

The Identification Office wishes
to inform all University students
of the policy concerning the stu-
dent identification card. Student’s
blue plastic cards are permanent
cards that should not be destroyed
or thrown away. Students will not
be issued another card at the out-
set of the 1968-1969 academic
year without paying a $5.00 re-
placement fee.

The plasticcard is validated
each term by a term validation
certificate. This certificate is ob-
tained from Student Accounts by
presenting a paid invoice and the
blue plastic card. Both cards must

 

be carried together for appropri-
ate University privileges.
Students leaving the Univers-
ity for a period longer than one
term should return the plastic
card to the Identification Office
(324 Schenley Hall). The card
will be re-issued when they enter
the University at a later date.
However, students planning to re-
turn in September, 1968, should
retain the plastic identification
card. Students that are graduat-
ing during the year should re-
turn their plastic cards to the
Identification Office. This should

be done before students leave the A

University.

Senate Passes Resolution  
After Lengthy Deliberation

Student Government (SG) voted to accept membership
in the National Student Association (N SA). This decision
Wednesday evening came after much Senate debate and
was hailed by SG President Ken Scheuler as a significant
step which should be taken with “no reservations and a.

SG Sends Letter
To All Parents
About Tuition

In conjunction with a resolu-
tion passed last week, Student
Government (SG) will send a
letter to the parents of all under-

graduate in-state students. The
letter asks parents to write to
their legislator urging payment of
originally promised funds to the
University. The letter follows:
Dear Parents,

The state legislature of Penn-
sylvania recently acted upon a
measure whieh is of direct and
vital conceril to you, as parents
of a University of Pittsburgh stu-
dent.

Approximately one year ago,
the legislature approved our edu-
cational appropriation to which
we are entitled as a state-related
institution. After delaying the
badly-needed funds for six
months, the legislature, upon pres-
sure from students and adminis-
tration, finally released the ap-
propriation. However, the legis-
lature has seen fit to decrease
the appropriation so significantly
that it will precipitate major fi-
nancial changes within the Uni-
versity. In order to accommodate
the deficit, our Chancellor has
been forced to predict a tuition
increase of at least $100 for the
academic year 1968-69.

The added financial burden
this action will bring to you is
obvious. Our annoyance with the
state legislature is great. We can-

not allow them to play political.

football with higher education in
this state, or to renege on their
moral responsibility to you and
to us.

Yet the framework within which
we, as students, can act is se-
verely limited, for most of us
are not of voting age.

As parents, you have that right
and the pressure you can bring
to bear is great. Most people
never realize the power behind a
single vote, let alone a consoli-
dated one. It can be used as an
instrument to force our legislators
to answer to their moral respon-
sibility.

Therefore, we urge, rather we
big you, our voting parents, to
contact your legislator immediate-
ly to express your demand that
the legislature of the State of
Pennsylvania adhere to this re-
sponsibility.

V_ Sincerely,
The Students of the

 

_ V  \\\‘\\i

 

V University of Pittsburgh, V

 

positive attitude.”

The affiliation with the USNSA
now will enable all students on
this campus to express concern
not only with campus issues but
with national issues as well.

In the Vice President’s report,
‘Frank Tutino told the senate that

there was going to be a revamp- ,

ing of the student affairs section
of the University. Dean Crit_ch-
field has been promoted to assist-
ant chancellor for student affairs,
and other‘ significant changes
have been made.

A letter was written and pre-
sented to the Senate which is
going to be mailed to the parents
of the students of the University
in several weeks. This letter urg-
es the parents to write to their
representatives, and urge them
to give us the money we were
promised.

In another discussion, Jim Car-
nahan, chairman of the Spirit
Committee, reported that Athle-
tic Director Frank Carver has
proposed a plan to charge stu-
dents somewhere from $8 to $12
fee for attending football games.
This proposal, if carried out,
would bring $30,000 to $40,000
to carry out the football program.
The Senate's general reaction to
the bill showed its disapproval
of the proposal.

. Roberta Block was unanimous-
ly voted chairman of the SG Edu-
cation Committee.

An Allocations Committee mem-
ber Rich Ombres noted that ap-
plications have been made avail-
able to all recognized organjza-
tions on campus, and are due by
May 1. If any organization has
not as 0f yet picked up an appli-
cation for allocations SG urges
them to do so.

The Orientation Committee has
announced that this year there
will be four orientartions rather
than nine.

CHOICE ’68

Three thousand students
turned out Wednesday to vote
in Choice ’68. “I’m very pleas-
ed with the results," said Di.
anne Ulyon, campus chairman
of Choice ’68, “as they show
a good student representation
-—commuter, dorm, and grad
students.”

Choice ’-68 will be conduct.
ed nationally on April 24th_
The results should appear in
Time magazine about the first
of May.

University results will be
published at a later date in the
Pitt News. Miss Ulyon feels
that the results “will probably
show the confusion that result-
ed from President Johnson's
speech last Sunday night.”

A13 Hand In Draft Cards

by BRUCE LEVENSON

Thirteen resisters handed in
their draft cards Wednesday eve-
ning at a draft resistance service
held in the United Oakland,_Min-
istry.

“In this service we are saying
‘no’ to the war and to the draft.”
said resister Llowell Haynes be-
fore an audience of nearly 200.
“We are compelled to speak out
for the men who love this coun-
try but refuse to serve in the arm-

: ed services.” he added.

The service was similar to serv-
ices held in many other cities
across the country. In response
to the third National Resistance
Day. The draft cards that were
collected have been sent to the

Attorney General in Washington.
' The principal purpose of the
meeting was to aid in bringing
about an end to the draft and the
war, by effective draft resistance.

“We are tired of the notion that‘

people are here to serve the gov-
ernment.” Ted Marsh. a South
Hills student who refused to serve
when drafted. told the audience.
“We are denying the South Viet-
namese people the right to have
their own government.“

that “we have made a mistake"
in fighting in Vietnam. "Let us

He further asserted that the US

Reorganization

The Chancellor's announcement that the Univers-
ity will combine its separate dean of men’s and dean
of women’s staff does not surpriseus but it does offer
us an opportunity to review objectively the major
points of the decision.

Dr. Posvar stated that the move “is in keeping
with the most modern practices of student affairs or-
ganization. It eliminates an unnecessary separation
and duplication of student affairs activities and it will
permit us to better coordinate our living and learning
programs for all students.”

This new and modern student affairs philosophy
is well taken. It is this type philosophy that will hope-
fully streamline the archaic nature of the University
administrative set-up. T -

Moreover, the personnel that have been promoted
have experience in the student affairs area. And we
si'ncerely hope that they will perform their newly
created duties in a diligent manner. But, this, ‘of
course remains to be seen. I

The only problem that we foresee is one of transi-
tion. The students have been socialized to the separate
dean of men’s and dean of women’s staff. A proud
tradition has been established by the twelfth floor and
consequently many University women are proud of
the heritage thathas been engrained in them. Like-
wise, the men at the University, we feel, have main-
tained a total lack of’ identification with the practices
of the women’s organization.

The crux of the problem lies with this central
poi'nt. Will the student affairs reorganization achieve
its Bash’: goal:-the fusion of student affairs activities
in the hope for better coordination?

We cannot answer this fundamental question at
this time. But We must say that theme behind the
administrative reorganization can be tossed aside un-
less the students and the administration work togeth-
er in order to break down the barriers that exist today.

McCarthy Myth

The recent decision of 19 out of 22 leaders of the
Pitt Students for McCarthy to extinguish their alleg-
iance to the Minnesota Senator is a step in the right
direction for students in the nation and on this cam-
pus.

In the March 18 editorial, The Pitt News stated

Would

McCarthy Be

An

Better?

by IVAN ABRAMS
Contributing Editor

Last week, before Lyndon John-
son’s announcement of his inten-
tion not to run, I attempted to
write this column, questioning
the wisdom of endorsing Senator
Kennedy at the same time one
embraces Senator McCarthy. Un-
fortunately, at that time, the dif-
ferences between the two men and
their positions were less clear-cut
than they are today, and I was
unable to write anything coher-
ent.

THIS WEEK, however, the is-
sues have been clarified. Lyndon
Johnson has said he will not run.
Whether this is a .true statement
or not can be debated endlessly.
This leaves two men in the race
for the Democratic nomination

, for the United States Presidency

—Robert Kennedy and Eugene
McCarthy.

Students for McCarthy, and oth-
er groups of its ilk, are being
forced into deciding whether they
are in reality for McCarthy, or
for the errant Senator from New
York.

McCarthy has stated repeated-
ly that he is not a standard bear-
er for anybody. He is attempting
to win the nomination for him-
self alone. But Kennedy, until
last Sunday night, at least, seem-
ed to view McCarthy as an ex-
plorer into the vast wilderness of
America; and explorer to be shov'
ed aside as soon as the time was
ripe.

KENNEDY HAS never been
really anti-Johnson, merely pro-
Kenedy, and it is noteworthy
that he, not Senator McCarthy,
will soon be meeting at the White
House with the President.

It seems likely that Bobby
would like very much to be Lyn-
don’s hand-picked boy at the Au-
gust convention.

While Kennedy seems very
much like the stereotyped power-
hungry politic-ian, Senator McCar-
thy, with his relatively low-key,
unpolished campaign has impress-
d many people as being sincerely
devoted to rebuilding America,
both by ending the Vietnam war
and by concentrating on domestic
problems.

Great American Scene -

THERE CANNOT, of course, be
any guarantee that McCarthy, if
elected, will be any more of a
saviour than was Lyndon John-
son, but his honesty now does
give rise to hope.

If, as many people have said,
the electoral process doesn’t work
in this country, then the election
of Bobby Kennedy would hasten
demise. But if the democratic
system can be salvaged, then
Senator McCarthy, if he remains
true to his previous statements,
may be the man to save it.

The Presidency should not be
thought of as the highest point in
an individual’s career; rather it
should be position of leadership
for the nation. We have endured
five and one half years of per-
sonal aggrandizement under Lyn-
don Johnson; we must ‘not know-
ingly vote for eight years more.

IF SENATOR ‘McCarthy is
elected, he will have to prove his
integrity, but Senator Kennedy
has long ago shown himself to
be an opportunist.

In the race between the two
men, I’ll take McCarthy -—- and
cross my fingers.

Anti-Dixie HHH N ow Needs South

by MIKE BROURMAN

tions and those of other young liberal Democrats.

The possible candidacy of Hubert Humphrey
sheds light upon one of the- most remarkable fea-
tures of American politics, namely, the constantly
shifting sands of political support.

It is one of the great ironies of this political
campaign that Humphrey will draw a major share
of his support for the nomination from the South,
which not too long ago ranked him as one of its
major political enemies.

IN 1948, HUMPHREY, then the young mayor
of Minneapolis was one of the leaders of a group
which tried to include a strong civil rights plank in
the Democratic convention platform.

The “Young Turk,” movement, as it was known,
failed in both this and its other prime objective, to
prevent the nomination of Harry Truman-.

What it succeeded in doing was to split the Dem- -

ocratic party into three factions. The Progressive
Party was formed under the banner of Henry Wal-
lace. In addition, the Dixiecrats, a group of South-
ern Democrats, nominated Stro-m Thurmond.

ONE OF THE MAJOR catalysts in the formation
of the Dixiecrats was Hubert Humphrey. In a sense,
the party was formed as a reaction against his ac-

Simon Sez -

 

But, twenty years later the South is a bastion
of Humphrey support. Just recently, the Demo-
cratic leaders in Texas agreed to nominate Gov-
ernor John Connally as a stand-in for the Vice-
President. Humphrey is also the choice of other
Southern leaders. -

This remarkable turnabout is not due to any
shift by Humphrey himself, but rather to the ‘tide
of events. The Vice-President is.-just as adamant
about civil rights as he was in 1948, even more .so.

BUT, IN THE SOUTH, a candidate's stand on
the race issue has become secondary to concern
for stopping the nomination of Bobby Kennedy.

Humphrey’s 1948 action has become dulled in
the memories of many Southerners with the pass-
age of time. However, Kenedy’s actions as Attorney
General are still fresh. Even more important, his
stand on the Vietnam war is opposed by most
Southern leaders. ,

And thus, Hubert Humphrey, who can’t even
count on the full support of his own state organ-
ization in his bid to be President, must place much
of his hope on a region with which he has been an
antagonist throughout much of his political career.

The Draft Worries Varuna, Too 

It seemed like a typical morn-
ing to Vanma the Hun. After he

nomination from President Johnson.” Today we feel
that Senator McCarthy will never rasp away the
democratic nomination from Senator Kennedy‘ or

Pragmatically, Senator Kennedy has a superior

 

knowledge of hardnose politics. He,served as cam-
paign manager for his brother in 1960 and has been
the veteran of a hard senatorial campaign in 1964.

Senator Kennedy, moreover, has a superior po-
litical organization. Men such as Adam Wolinsky, Ted
Sorenson, Stephen Smith, and Pierre Salinger are all
professionals of the highest caliber. These men were
largely responsible for the 1960 presidential victory
of John Kennedy. These facts combined with the Ken-
nedy name and ‘the inexhaustible Kennedy money,
presents the New York Senator with a political ma-
chine that is geared to a solid presidential campaign.

In contrast to this the McCarthy organization
lacks the overall professionalism that would ultimate-
ly carry the Senator to the nomination or the White
House. In fact, the McCarthy groups across the na-
tion are lacking in terms of political enpertise.

It is with these pragmatic factors in mind that
we must totally agree with the philosophy of the
newly formed Pitt Students For Kennedy. The stu-
dent myth of McCarthy is dying. And we feel that it
will be dead and buried after the first Kennedy- Mc-
Carthy clash in Indiana.

it nonchalantly under his arm.

Varuna sleepily greeted some

greetings, they all seemed to be
sullen and depressed.

VARUNA ASKED Alorak why
everyone was so gloomy. She an-
Swered, “Have you read the Hun
News yet?”

Admitting he hadn’t, Varuna
unrolled his news-skin and was
hit with the blaring headline,
“Graduate Deferments Cancell-
ed!” “Holy Atilla! thought Varu-
na. I've just been accepted to the
Inner Mongolian graduate school
of Public Holacost! Why, who's

how did he ever get to be head
of the draft?”

He read further and saw that

doctoral students were being giv-
en deferments. Varuna regretted
that he hadn’t listened to his mo-
ther and tried to become a medi-
cine man. He realized it was too
late to change his major now-
he had already compiled twenty.
four credits in Destructive Arts.

AFTER A GLOOMY breakfast,
Varuna went back to his room to
try to decide what he should do.
His whole life had been altered—.
his dreams of public destruction
on the local level were shattered
by the fateful headline.

Varuna considered the war in
Gaul to be immoral. Why don’t
they let those Gauls destroy them-
Se1Ves—Why do we have to do it?
he wondered. So what if there is
a Visigoth threat from North
Gaul? Why can’t we let the Gauls
decide their own destiny?

These problems bothered Va-
runa, but he began to reconcile
himself to the uselessness of try-
ing to solve them. He and other
students of sentiments similar to

 

THEY HAD WORN their white

these efforts to swing sympathy-

to their cause had proved futile.

SO INSTEAD of Worrying over
the T9311)’ important question of
whether the war was just or not
(as if wars could be just), Va-
runa tried to figure out a way
to beat the draft. He considered
the reserves, for he knew a guy
in the reserves whose tour of
duty never took him outside In-
ner or Outer Mongolia,

But his tent-mate informed him
that the reserves had a two year
Waiting list. He thought of join-
lng some kind of domestic organ-
ization such as VISTA——Volun-
teers in Service to Atilla—-but he
realized that he might be drafted
even after he served in one.

WAS KEATS THE BOB DYLAN
OF HIS DAY?

Who was the greatest of the English Romantic Poets-
Byron, Shelley or Keats? This question has given rise to
many lively campus discussions and not a few stabbings.
Let us today try to ﬁnd an. answer.

First, Keats (or The Louisville Slugger, as he is com-
monly called.) Keats’ talent bloomed early; While still a
schoolboy at St. Swithin’s he wrote his epic lines:

If I am good I get an apple,

So I don't whistle in the chapel.

From this distinguished beginning he went on to write
another 40 million poems, an achievement all the more re-
markable when you consider that he was only ﬁve feet
tall! I mention this fact only to show that physical prob-
lems never keep the true artist from creating. Byron, for
example, was lame. Shelley suffered from prickly heat all
winter long. Nonetheless, these three titans of literature
never stopped writing poetry for one day.

from his classic poem, Hail to thee, blithe strop, but no
matter how he tried he was never able to get a proper edge
on the Duke's razor, and he was soon banished to
Coventry. (This later became known as The Industrial
Revolution.)

One wonders how Shelley's life-—and the course of Eng-
lish poetry~would have differed if Personna Super Stain-
less Steel Blades had been invented 200 years earlier. For
Personna is a blade that needs no stropping, honing or
whetting. It’s sharp when you get it, and sharp it stays
through shave after luxury shave. Here truly is a blade
ﬁt for a Duke or a freshman. Moreover, this Personna,
this jewel of the blade-maker’s art, this boon to the cheek
and bounty to the dewlap, comes to you both in double-
edge style and Injector style. Get some now during “Be
Kind to Your Kisser Week.”

But I digress. Byron, I say, was in Greece and Shelley
in England. Meanwhile Keats went to Rome to try to
grow. Who does not remember his wistful lyric:

Although I am only ﬁve feet high,

Some day I will look in an elephant’s eye.

But Keats did not grow. His friends, Shelley and Byron,
touched to the heart, rushed to Rome to stretch him. This
too failed. Then Byron, ever the ladies man, took up with
Lucrezia Borgia, Catherine of Aragon, and Annie Oakley.
Shelley, a more domestic type, stayed home with his wife
Mary and wrote his famous poem:

I love to stay home with the missus and write,

And hug her and kiss her and give her a bite.

Mary Shelley ﬁnally got so tired of being bitten that
she went into another room and wrote Frankenstein.
Upon reading the manuscript, Shelley and Byron got so
scared they immediately booked passage home to Eng-
land. Keats tried to go too, but he was so small that the
clerk at the steamship office couldn’t see him over the top
of the counter. So Keats remained in Rome and died of
shortness.

Byron and Shelley cried a lot and then together com-
posed this immortal epitaph:

Good old Keats, he might have been short,

But he was a great American and a heck of a good sport.

Special Interview

Nikolai Todorov

Discusses Bulgaria

A greater knowledge of the ob-
scure foreign policy of Commun-
ist Bulgaria was made available
to The Pitt News in a special in-
terview with Professor Nickolai.
Toderoy. director of the Institute
for Bulgarian Studies.

Toderov. told The Pitt News
that Bulgarian — Greek relations
have become friendly. He stated
that “he had more opportunities
to go to Greece. This friendly cli-
mate permits a great amount of
cultural exchange between Bul-
garia and other states." according
to the professor.

E Reflections

 

Sports Situation Better,

~ by Roy Jacobs

 

 

 
 

ButWaitTillNeXtYear§

V7VVV7VVVVVYvVVvvvvv

Sports Editor

For many students at the University, the athletic year
is over. They’l1 go home now and wait ti'1l next year. May-
be next year Pitt’ll win a few more games. Maybe she
won’t.

But some of the students might stop and wonder how
far the athletic program has come this year. Or if it’s
moving in the right direction. Or if it’s moving at all.

Retiring Sports Editor Jay Rosenstein indicated he
thought he saw the light in the tunnel, and Athletic Direc-
tor Frank Carver couldn’t agree more wholeheartedly.

“We’ve made tremendous strides this year,” said. Carv-
er. “The long black period is over. We can see the light ahead.
I might even say we can see sunshine ahead.”

And it is the feeling of this writer that this is very
much the case. The question remains, though: Where are
we heading next year?

There is no doubt that football sets the pace for the
whole year,arou;nd the school. Dave Hart is moving into
his third season as head coach, and people are seriously
expecting him to produce.

Many people are expecting six wins next fall. The talent
is there, but so is a serious problem. Pitt has been a loser
since 1963, and losing promotes an attitude that is hard to
overcome. Unfortunately, the “heralded freshmen,” as they
have been dubbed, were subjected to this new feeling (for
them) last fall when they suffered through a 1-3 season.

If Hart and_ his staff can create this spring and next
fall a real winning spirit and not a superficial substitute,
the potential for an Indiana-type season is there. If not,
well . . .

Basketball is the other major sport here, at least that
is the hope. There is no doubt that next year’s team, under
new coach Buzz Ridl, will make a respectable showing.
But Ridl i's in the opposite position o-f Hart. He must prove
that he can recruit. This year he got a late start.

Two other sports underwent coaching changes and have
been revitalized. Dave Adams surprised a lot of people with
his varsity wrestlers’ performances, but his real achievement
has been the freshmen he’s recruited. Carver admitted that
he had made a mistake before in thinking that a part-time
coach could handle wrestling.

The track program, as well as cross country, is look-
ing very good under the direction of Jim Banner. His re-
cruits created a lot of excitement at the Field Ho-use last
  % e remalnlng nrn Q1-Y, gmyaa ._n ,_____M______ J'__

. One 0 e remaining problem areas is gymnastics,
especially with Dave Shidemantle graduating. Coach War-
ren Neiger had more scholarships to work with last year,
but he couldn’t land any superior talent for his frosh
squad. There is no natural feed-in of gymnasts locally, and
it may be a while before Neiger is able to sell Pitt outside
of western Pa. But the financial support is still there.

Swimming and soccer are on the way back, too. Give
them time.

As for the spring sports, it’s a shame everybody is go-
ing home. The spring sports no doubt suffer from a lack of
attention. Year after year, baseball coach Bobby Lewis turns
out a winner. And for the time being, winners are scarce
around here. Maybe next year will be different. I hope so.

 

TWO GRID linemen square off ‘against each other
during last year's spring football drills. This year

Baseballers
Rained - Out

Second Time

Last year, the baseball team
wasrained-out nine times. And
this season the baseballers are
ahe-ad of that pace.

The Monday opener at Indiana
State was postponed because of
wet grounds and scattered show-
ers, and yesterday, the home
opener against West Virginia was
washed-out too.

The rnitters haven't played a
regular season game yet. But they
will try again Saturday afternoon
when they visit Bucknell.

The rains have been disap-
pointing to the mitters for many
reasons. For one, the lay-off could
have. bad effects on the sharp-
ness of the team. Inactivity can
only hurt, not help the hitters,
fielders, and pitchers.

Secondly, the rainy weather
once again confines the mitters
to indoor practices in Trees Hall
and the Field House.

And thirdly, the rnitters are
confident of winning, and anxious
to prove that they can.

However, Lewis doesn’t seem
to be too optimistic about getting
in the Bucknell game Saturday.
When told that it usually rains in
Lewisburg after Pittsburgh, Lew-
is said, “it will probably snow.”

  

will be better. He also found that he had more time
this way to prepare for spring practice, rather than-
rushing. from recruiting to drilling. The first prac.
tice is scheduled for April 20.

Carver Sugg
For Student Grid Admissions

by ROY JACOBS

There now exists a defin-
ite possibility that in the fu-
ture Pitt students will be
required to buy reserved season
tickets for Panther home foot-
ball games. This proposal was
submitted by Athletic Director
Frank Carver to Dean of Student
Affairs Jack Critchfield.

The news was reported to Stu-
dent Government on Wednesday
night by Jim C-arnahan, chair-
man of the Spirit Committee-.

“I don’t think we’ll be able to
do it this year, anyway,” said
Carver‘, indicating that most stu-
dents are going home shortly and
would be at a disadvantage in
the first-come-first-served system.

“This would be the University’s
decision,” Carver continued. “The
system has definite advantages.
For instance, those people who
like football will get a good seat.
They won’t get pushed out by
somebody’s grandmother,” Car-
ver joked.

The A.D. mentioned that fre-
quent misuse of I.D. cards by
students has in the past led to
many non-students usurping the

good seats from deserving stu- «

dents.

“I don’t know what objection
the students would raise to this,”
remarked Carver, “except that
they don’t want to spend the
money. They do have one of the

_lowest tuitions in the country_

here.”

However, the sale of reserved
seats does not mean a relocation
of the student section.

“We couldn’t move the other
people out,” explained Carver.
“Some of them have been there
‘25-30 years.”

No decision has been reached
yet. Before it is made, Dean
Critchfield and Carnahan will

 

JIM. GARNAHAN
Organizes Student Survey

speak to as. many students as
possible.

“I thought the best way to
reach students,” said Carnahan,
“is to get a survey to see what
the kids would do. I’m working
on it now, including questions
about the card section we are
going to form.

“The problem,” he continued,
“is getting the right kind of ques-
tion. If the question just asks if
the student would be willing to
pay 8 to 142 dollars for season
seats, they’11 answer no. But
there are fraternities who would
like bloc seats. Other people want
special seats also. It depends a lot
on how good the football team
is.” a

By the time the plan can be in-
stituted, the football team will be
a good one; that could help the
proposal pass. For the time be-
ing, though, students have to wait
and see. But they can be assured
they will have some say in the
matter.

Delayed Spring Practice
Offers Hart Extra Time
For Player Evaluations

Rain and nasty weather
have blanketed Pittsburgh
most of the past few weeks.
In previous years, Dave Hart
would have been putting his grid-
ders through their spring paces
at this time. Instead, spring foot-
ball is still two weeks off.

“We’ve been able to do things
as a staff this year that we
weren’t able to do in the past,”
said Hart. “We used to rush
right from recruiting into spring
practice.

“This year we’ve just been
able to sit here, review films,
evaluate personnel, and not wor-
ry about recruiting,” he added.
“It’s so much better this way.”

Currently Hart has 21 prospects
signed to play here next year,
with several others hanging in
the balance. He expects to have
25 on aid in the fall.

His main concern now is plan-
ning out his practice schedule.
Hart hopes to fit 20' sessions into
21 days of practice. The first
three days of practice will all be
double sessions.

“We expect to set the person-
nel next Monday or Tuesday,”
commented Hart, who is entering
his third year as head coach.
“We’re hoping we place them
right, so they can get 20 days of
practice at that position."’

Hart pointed out that in the

past, the players were evaluated
offensively and defensively dur-
ing the spring and thereby lost
a good deal of practice time at
their eventual position. By study-
ing films of last year, Hart is
looking to eliminate most of the
experimenting.

Thinclads Hurt By Injuries

In Season Opener at Temple

by ED CONLEY
The odds will be against
the varsity track team in the
opener tomorrow at Tem-

ple.

The squad has a depth prob-
lem, this is already known. But,
the problem may multiply by the
time of the first event tomorrow.

One sprinter definitely will not
compete and another one may
also be out of action. Dave Brinn
will be sidelined due to an in-
jury, while a heavy cold has
made Carl Wooten a doubtful
starter. If Wooten misses the
meet Chet Wojiechowski may
have to handle the sprinting a-
lone.

Pole vaulter Bill Anderson is
nursing a broken finger and may
not be able to compete in the
meet, either, A back injury has
prevented Greg Ellis from enter-
ing any spring competition. Ellis
was the team’s star shot put
thrower during the indoor sea-
son.

Coach Jim Banner concedes
that there will be a problem:
“The team will be dou-baling and
tripling, but they’ll do their best
to try to win.” '

Banner knows that his team
will be down plenty of points
from the start, but he does not
give up. He knows, too, that the
Temple thinclads can be rough.

“They're well-balanced, they’ll
have someone in every event,”
he says.

    

GREG ELLIS
Out With Back Injury

Who are Temple"-s favorites?
Banner feels “Mahoney in the
mile and two mile, and Libanki
in the 440 and 880 will‘be real
tough.”

The coach cannot expect to be
out of these races, though. The
880 is a specialty of his star, Rog-
er Holly. Holly can expect help
from Paul Zink in this race.

Zink is also a strong miler,
and, along with team captain Paul
Greig, he is part of a good mile
entry. Greig will probably be the
number one man in the two mile
race.

The 440 is not minus talent on
the Panther squad either. Keith
Stoe-bler and Jack Neyer can be
expected to run in this event.
Holly could go here, too, if the
coach decides to use him.

Phi Ep, PiKA Capture IM

Fraternity Sports Crowns;

Sig Chi, Kappa Sig Second

Phi Epsilon Pi and Pi Kappa Alpha won the fratern-
ity all-sports trophy for intramural competition in leagues

“A” and “B” respectively.

Sigma Chi was the “A” runner-up, while Kappa Sigma took sec-

ond place overall honors in “B.”

Phi Ep took first place in football, paddleball, tennis and billiards
to outdistance their opponents in point totals. They also finished sec-

ond in softball, and third in wrest-
ling and basketball.

Sigma Chi won the wrestling
championship and finished sec-
ond in basketball and swimming.

Delta Sigma Phi took first place
honors in basketball and track
and finished second in wrestling.
In other “A” competition, Pi
Lambda Phi won the softball
championship, while Delta Tau
Delta won the swim meet.

In league “B"’, PiKa won indi-
vidual championships in tennis,
basketball and paddleball. They
finished second in swimming,
softball and football and third
in wrestling.

Runners-up Kappa Sig took first
place in softball, football and
track-—they tied for second in the
basketball tournament.

Theta Chi won league “B”
swimming and wrestling cham-
pionship and also tied for second

C _. in basketball.

Phi Gamma Delta won the poc-
ket billiards trophy; they tied for
first in the tennis tournament.

Under the direction of Leo Be-
rnis, the intramural program be-
gan with softball in September

 and was concluded last week
. A with the track meet. In addition
to fraternity competition, the

program included dorms, engi-

neers and’ independents.

According to Bemis, next fall
an intramural soccer program
will be initiated. _,

Softball will be the first sport
on the summer intramural agen-
da. Entries are now being ac-
cepted in the intramural office
at Trees Hall.

A POLlTlCAl. STUDY TOUR‘

will be conducted this summer by aprofessor of international
relations in the gradxtate school of a well-known university.
A two week course in contemporary problems (in English)
at the Sorbonne will be supplemented by seminars with
leading scholars and statesmen (such as Ludwig Erhard, Enoch
Powell, MP, Prof. Count Bertraiid de Jouvenal, Arch-luke Otto
Von Halisburgl in lo countries. Social activities with European
students (Oxrord Balls, etc.) will be included in this non-
regimenied tour for intelligentstudents. For moreinformation,

. ROGER HOLLY
Top Man in 880

Banner is not exactly sure who
will enter what events.

“It’s still a shaky line-up. Pm
still switching around,” he says.

But, he is sure that his men
will be used a lo-t. In fact, he may

use Bob McElheny in five events. ,

“Mac” is the team’s best jumper
and can enter the javelin and the
shot put events.

The extra load will not be a
convenience, but the team should
be used to it. They have just com-
pleted an indoor season in which
the coach was often forced into
entering his men more often than
he would have liked.

Banner does not know if his
team can overcome the odds that
are against victory, but he does
proudly boast, “They’ll sacrifice.
That’s the important thing.”

Meet I.-Bucknell

Netters Seek First  

by MARTHA? HARTLE

On paper, Bucknell looks like a loser, but Ben Pope’s
netmen aren’t expecting a pushover Saturday at Lewis-

town.

Thenetters from Bucknell have lost matches to Wake Forest,
North Carolina and Davidson already this season. All three losses
were 9-0 shut-outs. But according to coach Pope, “These satistics
don't mean anything because all three of their defeats came at the

hands of tough opponents.”

“The farthur South you go,” he explained, “the better caliber
of tennis you see. For example, Wake Forest beat Bucknell 9-0, but
South Carolina beat Wake Forest by the same 9-0 score.”

In starting their season earlier, Bucknell will have a definite
advantage over the Panthers as far as beimg ready is concerned.
“They will have played six matches by the time we face them” Pope
emphasized. “This makes a lot of difference.”

The netmen opened their season Monday with a 6-3 loss at the

hands of rival West Virginia.

Bucknell wasn’t on the Panther schedule last year, but the last
time the two schools met, according to the coach, the Panthers had

a very weak squad.

“Even with that weak squad,” added Pope, “there were some
surprises». Our number one man beat theirs.”

Since that time, the tennis program has improved; this Saturday
there may be more pleasant surprises and upsets.

Bill Nichols and Bob Salembrier, Pope’s top men, will both be
looking for first victories of the year, while Tom Stromp and Bill
Goldstein will be trying to make it two straight in the win column.

Elliot Sainer and Chuck Wilson, both seniors, will also see action

for the Panthers.

Freshman J. D. Lewis, the highly touted prospect from North
Carolina, will be ineligible for varsity competition until after final

exams.

But the Panthers will be ready for Bucknell. “In most cases,
Bucknell would be too strong for us. They’ve got twenty-six courts

. Duffer Riick Golden “Talks”

      

 

His Way From TeeTo Green

by  ROSENGARTEN

Silence is golden says the proverb, but
to the golf team’s captain, Rick Golden, si-
lence spells disaster.

“The best part of my game is my talk,” stated
Rick, a transfer student from Emory College. “I
talk a good game. The more I talk; .the better I
play."

Rick, who constantly chatters from tee to green,
feels that his steady talk serves a dual purpose. “By
talking, I keep myself at ease, while at the same

“ time, I try to ‘psyche out’ my opponent with it,”

he said.

“I don't take golf as seriously as most people
do, and by constantly talking, I'm able to relax and
shoot a better round,” he added.

With this constant talking in a game which
many people feel requires strict silence, Rick con-
siders himself lucky that so far he has never been
told to shut-up by one of his opponents.

“I try to keep myself on the offensive at all
times and never let my opponent get the upper
hand in our conversation,” said Golden.

When Rick takes time out from talking to take
a shot, he feels that he performs best with his
woods and long irons. “My long game is my strong-
est and most consistent part of my overall game,”
explained Rick. “And besides, if I unnerve my on-
ponent enough, there is nothing better to protect
myself with than a long heavy driver.”

On the serious side, Rick feels that he owes a
great deal of whatever success he has had to his
father, who taught him the game. “I first learned
how to play golf while caddying for my father, who

Competition at Tucson

I may add is one of the best golfers I know," a bi-
ased Rick added.

“I’ve been playing for about 14 years, and I
haven’t had one lesson,” he continues. “Everything
I know, I’ve picked up by myself."’ The only time
Golden regrets not having any professional instruc-
tion is when he shoots a bad round, and can’t ex-
plain to himself just what went wrong.

With professional golf and golfers becoming al-
most a weekly fare on television, Rick believes that
a lot of good golf can be learned from the pros.
Golden’s favorite is Julius Boros.

The golf team plays two types of matches de-
pending upon the school their going against. “When
we’re home, we play match play, while when we’re
on the road we usually play medal play, especially
against Southern Conference schools,” explained
Rick. In medal play, the lowest score wins, while
in match play it’s the total number of holes won.

“I prefer to shoot in match play, because the
game stays more friendly. Also a good golfer can
really show how good he is by making a shot that
has to be made in order to w.in the hole,” Rick
stated.

Coach Rex Peery has set a goal for his golfers;
one which Rick feels’ the team can reach. “Peery
promised that if the team captures the Eastern’s
crown or any one of the golfers finishes in the top
four, then the team will take a trip to the Nation-
als,” he explained. “Of course, our first goal is
a .500 season, which I feel we should attain with
no trouble at all.”

With the season only one match old, a highly
optomistic Rick Golden may just be able to “talk”
his teammates towards a winning season.

the news. Vaulter Dave Shide-
mantle is competing in the Na-
tional Gymnastic Championships
at Tucson, Arizona.

The championships started yes-
terday and will continue into to-
morrow. Coach Warren Neiger ac-
companied Shidemanvtle.

Last month, Dave regained the
Eastern Intercollegiate Gymnas-
tics championship in long horse
vaulting that he had won as a
sophomore. In his first season he
also finished fifth in the nation
in the event.

Shidemantle was recently nam-
ed gymnastics Most Valuable
Player for this past season. He
competed in almost every event
possible throughout the course

of the year. Towards the end of
the dual meet competition he suf-
fered a painful leg injury which
prevented him from competing in
his specialty until the Eastern
championships.

His injury healed, Dave is con-
fident of a high ﬁnish at Tucson.

  Golfers Seek Win at CMU;

Peery Still Has Confidence

The golf team will make a second attempt at getting it it

their first win today as they go against Carnegie-Mellon.
The match will be played at the Tartan’s Longview Coun-

try Club course.

Coach Rex Peery appears to have an evenly talented group this

season will be like.

- spring. That is, if the first match was any indication of what the

In that opener, which was lost to West Virginia, the seven duffers
used by Peery came within three strokes of each other. It would ap-
pear that any one of them could wind up with the best score in any .
given match. Henry Higgenbottom shot the lowest score in the loss.

His 79 pleased the coach.

“I’m satisfied with Henry. He
shot well,” said Peery.

Peery is also satisfied with the

remainder of his Squad, despite
the first loss.

He said after the opener, “They
played well . . . We’ll beat Car-
negie.”

If they do beat CMU it will be
two straight over their Oakland
neighbors. Last year at P.itt’s
Shannopin Country Club the Pan-
thers took .an easy 6-1 decision.
The two teams have only this one
game on the schedule against
each other.

Peery admits that he does‘ not
know much about this year’s Tar-
tan team, but he really does not
have to know too much. His play-
ers are ready, determined to win.
If their coa~ch’s optimism shlows
in the golfers’ play, CMU will
have a rough time.

Peery emphasizes, “We’ll beat
Carnegie—Mel1on. We need that
one.”

I-Ie does not want his team to
go into the exam break with an
0-2 record against them.

Placement Service Report

Campus Job Recruitment On Rise

by ALICE GOLDSMITH

Horace Greeley’s advice in the
mid-19th century was “Go West,
young men.” The high recruit-
ing activity on college campuses
across the nation today indicates

I that the land of opportunity is in

the field of industry and big
business.

According to Dr. Walter Rite-
nour, director of the Placement
Service, “regisNation is heavier
this year than ever before.” In
listing a number of causes for

this increase, he emphasizes that-

“we can only speculate on the
reasons.”

 

DR. WALTER RITENOUR

The elimination of draft defer-
ments, government cutbacks of
Ph.D.’s in the natural sciences,
the economic boom. and manpow-
er shortage were all cited as Bos-
sible reasons for the increase in
job applicants. However. since
many companies are still recruit-
ing and students have yet to make
their decisions about which offer
to accept, the data is inconclu-
sive. I

Dr. Ritenour advises his stu-
dents that “the greatest single

factor in getting a job is having

clearly defined goals.” The abil-
ity to communicate ones ideas .in
simple, lucid language, is another
important attribute because “the
student must project his goals and
sell himself during a 30 minute
interview.

Although the formal recruiting
programs are held during the fall
and winter trimesters. the Place-
ment Service is open 12 months a

year. Dr. Ritenour adds that the
“Placement Service never gives
up on anyone who does not give
up on himself.” In addition, the
facilities of the Service are avail-
able to all University alumni who
desire its services at any time.

According to the March Salary
Survey, "published by the College
Placement Council. “The Aero-
spaceindustry continues to make
the most offers to bachelor's can-
didates." although it offers the
fourth highest monthly salary at
$743.

The Survey states that “In dol-
lar value of offers, the chemical
and drug industry remains on top
with an average monthly offer of
$764, followed by electronics,
$756, and electrical machinery
and petroleum, both $751.”

The offers of employment at
the University between Aug. 1.
1967. and Feb. 23, 1968. yield sim-
ilar results. At the bachelor level.
the offered salary range was the
highest in chemical engineering
($705-$950). and electrical engi-
neering ($644-$860).

For liberal arts majors the of-
fered salary range has been $600-
$702 per month, with a median
average monthly salary of $653.
This is considerably higher than
the median monthly salary for
1966-67 which was $585.

Dr. Ritenour adds that “these

“I Have A Dream,”
Said God’s Minister

by DON MARBURY

“I have Ia. dream, a dream of a Negro. and
white child walking hand in hand without fear,
or without prejudice.” Martin Luther King, 
ist-er of the word of God, advocate of the equal-
ity of all persons, and a man, was shot to death
Thursday -as he stood on the veranda of his motel.

Disbelief, pain, and intense hatred, were my
ﬁrst reactions when I -heard of his dearth. Then
after awhile all I could feel was pity for the per-
son who had decided to become God and decide
the death of a fellow human being. I pitied the
mind of a person who could do .a -thing like this.
I pitied him for the hate that he must have had,
to do something like this’, and I pitied him, for
being unable to control .the forces that could
drive him to such an act. I wondered does he
really feel that he has done any good or solved
anything?

Martin Luther King was a man who believed
in one basic principle that probably all of us
have heard at one time or another, “All men are
created equal in the eyes of the creator.” Some-
times when I hear the words “nigger” and “hun-
ky” I am just completely baffled. This has been
asked so many times before but why, just why
does the color of a person’s skin or what he be-
lieves in make him any different, or less a person
than anyone else? ‘

We’re all people arent’ we? If
cut, don't we all bleed? Don't
all of us long for the same 
things, happiness, prosperity, 
love, a wife and family? Tlheni
why? Why can't I walk dow
Forbes Ave. with a white gir
without both the members of
my race, and the white race
showing their contempt for theé
two of us?

s

 

Sometimes I go someplace by 
myself and ask myself, “Oh '
dear G-od, why is there so much 
hate and prejudice in the world? 
Why is everyone referred to as 
belonging to a race; »-the white 5
race, or the Negro race, or the
Jewish nation? Why can’t we
all be one big race, where it
doesn't matter if we are white,
black or yellow?” As -one may
have gathered, my dreams are
also very idealistic. 

of brotherhood.

His Death Caused 

Fearful Wet Eyes

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

You whispered softly, if you were a man ’

Friday. You were thoughtful, you were
solemn, and for yet another time, you ques-
tioned what the future had in store.

You wore black, if you were a woman. You.
wore eye-mal(eup, smeared from wet eyes; eyes
that arched because a great man had died.

You wondered why, if you were a child. You
couldn’t ﬁgureout the grownup world and why
it would cause the death of an-y man, let alone
a great man.

Confusion. Speculation. Fear. All were at the
front Friday; they saturated your emotions. For
a man who stood for all men had died.

For America, it was not enough to lose Pres-
ident J.ohn Fitzgerald Kennedy ﬁve years ago,
Nov. 22. Now she had lost another son.

ple somehow -took for granted the physical be-
ing and the hopes of each one.

Shock followed the death of
Kennedy, but for -the Presiden-
y, America’-s forefathers had

Shock followed the death of

times, alone within his people.

son for equality with the White
prognosticators. He was a go-
between, honored and taken for
granted in the ‘same breatlie by
both races.

    
  
  
  
  
   
  
   
  
 

Dr. Martin Luther King had faith in mankind. He
maintained his fai'th even though men continued to
kill each other. Never once did Martin Luther King
suggest that man should lift up his hands against his
fellowman. Instead, Dr. King was a man of peace, a
man of courage and a man of non-violence.

Above all, Dr. King had a dream——a dream that
all men, black and white, Jew and Gentile, Protestant
and Catholic would one day walk hand and hand.

He dreamed of the day when all children, black
and white, could walk down any street in the south,
north, west or east and not judge each other by their
color of their skin but by the content of their charac-

ter.

But the beautiful words of this man will be heard
no longer; he shall no longer walk at the head of great
marches for he is dead. Yet, Martin Luther King’s
memory will never die; his memory will live on in the
hearts and minds of men for ages to come for his mes-
sage was one of hope and vision. And one day in the
future, we will look back to the courageous life of
Martin Luther King and we will say that he was right;
we will say that he saw the light of truth, and then we
will know the path that we must follow.

And that path is the road to understanding-the
road to communication. The road will be rocky and
White Americans will have to be its travelers for we

are at fault. We are the ones who are the elite of this

  
   

of Dr. King.

Both blacks and whites
must now as never before
take heed of Dr. King’s life
work. All Americans in this V
time of need and sorrow"
must be prepared to face the
ultimate truth — and We
must face ourselves as hu-
man beings. People must
now look at-themselves and
find the true meaning of
brotherhood.

More than anything all of
use must have faith in our-
selves and our fellow man.
Man is a subjective animal
—a being that can rationa1- ,
ly choose between two alternatives. Being a subjective
animal, man has inherent faith. Faith in God and
faith in his fellow man. If there is one thing, that
Dr. King wanted to bring to light duri'ng his life it
was that ultimately man will not only learn to live
with himself but also with his neighbor be he black,
white, yellow, or red. This is the message of Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King. It is a message for all of us; a mes-
sage of the future; a message of hope and determin-
ation; a message of pride in mankind.

Today is the time of mourning but tomorrow will
be the time of rememberance. A great man never

But now chaos has followed
Dr. Martin Luther King’s assas-
in-a.'t’ion. It is only spring now.
Undoubtedly, the summer is fer-
-tilized with m-ore disaster. But
the immediate damage and des-
truction is trivial, compared to
what the importance of King’s

death means to the future. Many.

people, old and young alike, may
yet see the parallelism between
King’s death and Kennedy’s
death. ‘

After Dallas, Kennedy’s Civil
Rights Bill passed through Con-
gress in 1964. This bill and other
legislation had stalled, however,
while Kennedy was alive.

It is an amazing shame that
one great person must suffer,
yes must even die in his attempt
to help his people.‘ Martin Lu-
ther King died for his -cause.

“We’re through with segrega-
tion,” King said. “We’re moving
up the highway of freedom to-
ward the city of equality and
we can't afford to stop now.”

Martin Luther King wanted

Memorium: A Prayer or Racial Unity

(This prayer, “A Litany For Racial
Unity,’ was just a part of the Univers-
ity's Heinz Chapel Memorial services
Friday for Dr. Martin Luther King,
the victim of an -assasin’s bullet.

The eloquence of the exerpts from
the prayer honors the dream of this
great American.)

JUDGE US NOT for our self- love,
our rationalizations and lies in our re-
lations with other men, our perpetua-
tion of social and psychological ghettos
in which to barricade ourselves from
our brothers, our maintenance of segre-
gation as our national and religious
way of life, and our too easy accept-

'ance of cultural norms because we wish
"to be popular, therefore becoming con-

formist in our thoughts and actions.

We petition You to hear us, so that
Your Spirit will convert our intention,
and we may cease being racial hypo-
crites and may commit ourselves to
the cause of social justice which repre-
sents the working of love in the sp-here
of human life.

THAT You WILL teach us really to
see one another, not in racial categories
or as- strangers wearing colored masks
but as living and human persons cre-
ated by You in Your very image.

That You will endow us with cour-

age to fight against racial evil in the
spirit of nonviolence and love, making
no peace with the oppression of this in-
justice.

That You will inform our minds and
enlighten our ignorance so that we may
do battle with evil in all those specific
social and economic situations which
limit another person’s opportunities to
work, study, vote, live, cultivate free-
dom, and pursue happiness.

THAT YOU WILL let us hear the
human hearts beating alongside our
own, and let others hear the message
of our own beating hearts, so that we
may communicate with one another in

a spirit of compassion and naked mu-l

tual need.

That You will show us how to avoid
empty smiles and polite forms which
perpetuate evasion of truth and dis-
honest relationships.

That You will look with mercy upon
these who have been broken in body,

mind, or spirit as fighters in the cause ,

of racial integration and human love;
upon those who have been imprisoned
or are now in jails for this cause; upon
those who have seen loved ones mar-
tyred in lynchings, murder, and humili-

“Its not how long you live.
Its how well you live.’’ This
was the answer Dr. Martin
Luther King gave to ei question
concerning his regard for life,
on a recent television show’.

Dr. K-ing lived only 39 years,
in’ our advanced society where
a man can expect to live for
well over 60. Thi-rty-min-e short
years, and yet how well he did

Dr. King spoke before 2,000
persons here at the .Univ-erwsiuty
November 4, 1966. At that time
he foretold of the violence that
could land would rock this coun-
try if something was not -done
soon. Dr. King called for -a “mas-

.sive action program” to solve
this problem-.

tice, as well as to profess it as a principle.

If his death is to have signiﬁcance, we must renew our dedication
to the achievement through non-violent means of complete social equality

and justice for all Americans regardless of race or color.

   
   

 
 
  

This program was designed to
end blight in the slums, and to
relieve the economic condition
of the Negro in the United
States today. Dr. King said that
he realized that this program
would take billions of dollars.
The. only question: does our na-
tion have the will to do it? King
seemed to feel that the answer
should be obvious. '

When Dr. King recently spoke
he noted some
startling facts:
States government spends $500,-
000 for each Viet Cong they kill,
and y-et spends only 54 cenrts

ations; and upon those who have been
martyrs themselves.

THAT YOU WILL lift up in spirit
those who have been subject to loss of
employment, to social criticism and iso-
lation, and to personal pain because if
their involvement in the struggle for

social justice and human love; and ,

those who have witnessed to their be-
lief in Your creation of man in Your
own image by participation in expres-
sions of protest against injustices and
inhumanity‘.

Tha.t You will instruct the hearts of
those who actively hate in human re-
lations, who are ignorant owing to their
education or background, who keep
alive the power of prejudice, and who
are persecutors, jailers, racist leaders
of public opinion, racist educators,
priests, rabbis, and ministers.

That You will guide us in a reso-
lute advance in interracial efforts to
combat the evils of racial segregations,
so that we may avoid the intensified
and subtle forms of continued segrega-
tion which isolated racial efforts by
themselves can represent; that we —
while and black, red and yellow-may
be united rather than separated in the

ally listen.

“The United

with justice.”

Even here at the University
a year and half ago, King stat-
ed, “The war plays havoc with
our domestic destinies.” At that
time, he noted that many of the
programs that aid the Negro,
such as the Poverty Program,
are being cut because of rising
Vietnam expenditures.

When he was here, Dr. King
warned that we cannot just sit
back and let time pass without
action. He warned that the idea
that “time will heal all evil” 
wrong. ‘Time is neutral,” said
Dr. King. “We cannot be more
concerned with tranquility and
maintaining the status quo than

common fight for equality, justice, and
humanity under God.

That You will gird us‘ for the battle
which we must wage against the forces

‘ of racial discrimination and segrega-

tion which deny both Your holiness in
Your act of creation and humanness of
man in his having been created by You;
that You will save us from sel_f-right-
eousness, increase humility in us, call
us to love You and one another, and
so possess our bodies, minds, and spir-
its by Your spirit that we may heed
the call to do Your will in our lives,
and have the strength to carry it out
in the world.

THAT WE MAY BE enabled to of-
fer to You, for Your blessing, the total-
ity of our lives and each others’ lives,
including our colors or our lack of
colors. ‘

, That we may be given strength and
love to accept Christian tension in the
midst of unchristian peace, and to seek
that peace which passes all understand-
ing in the midst of the Chrisrtian’s war.

You who are neither red, yellow,
black, nor white, but who has created
us in a marvelous variety of rich colors
and marked us with your image, we
ask You to hear us.
