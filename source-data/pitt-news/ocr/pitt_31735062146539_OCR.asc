In Summer

University division of the Re-
serve Oﬁicers’ Training corps. un-
der command of Major Merlin V.
Wills, will continue its general
training program during the sum-
mer months. This decision was
reached after a poll was conducted
among the present cadets to de-

termine how many of these men
plan to atten-d summer school.
Favorable results from this poll,
as well as the anticipation ot a
fairly large freshman enrollment
in June, prompted the decision to
offer military science :l'.l'1lS sum-
mer. —
The ROTC program prior to the
war consisted of four years train-
ing culminating in a lieutenant’s
commission in the Coast Artillery
corps reserve. With the advent of
the war, nearly all physically ﬁt
men were called into service be-
fore they could complete four
years’ work. As a result the course
was changed from one of CAC
training to one of basic military
training designed to better prepare
students -for Army service re-
gardless of brand of service or

Instruction of ROTC cadets is

Election time has come to Pitt campus. . _
A Just as the exercise of suffrage is one of the greatest_priv1-
leges of a citizen of the United States in a national election of
.oﬁ’icers, no less is its importance on an urban university campus
where students possess the right to choose who their leaders
shall be. - _ p _
' Just as it is a duty of every citizen to investigate the quali-
ﬁcations, character, personality of the nominees placed before
him on a. national slate, it is also the duty of every student _to
inquire about the requisites of the nominees placed before him
on the campus slate. _ .
Just as certain organizations group together and side with
the Republicans, Democrats, and other political parties in a na-

‘ tional campaign, so do fraternities and other college organiza-

tions join together to back their personal choice for office. Accu-
sations are frequently made against such followers because it is
the general feeling that they are not backing the candidate for
his worth alone,——but in hopes of remuneration at a later date.
Remuneration may take the form of sub-offices by appointment,
chairmanship of committees, or ingloriﬁcation, and ego-enhan_ce-
ment by identifying oiie’s self or ones group with the leading
power.

But what is the purpose of democracy? Is personal gain the
only thing we vote for? Are our desires so thwarted that we no
longer are able to stand on our own «feet and ﬁght for what we
want? Must we attach ourselves to others for recognition?

Let us follow a general outline of the bylaws of any organ-
ization. First of all, the nominating committee is appointed.
How? The membership of most committees is a composite of _all
types of individuals, who in turn, are members of various types
of organizations on campus. For example, the by—laws of Stu-
dent Congress read: Article I_V, Section 2, Nominations: Candi-
dates for the ten elective student members of the Congress shall
be chosen by nominating committees. Six junior women and
four senior women shall be nominated by a committee composed
of the presidents of the major campus organizations for women,
a retiring senior woman member of the Congress chosen by the
Senate, and the highest ranking woman ‘of the Pitt News. Six
junior men, and four senior men shall be nominated by a similar
committee of men.

_ Keeping the aboveexample in mind, let us move on to the
second point. The presidents of the major campus organizations
must possess some intelligence, integrity, progressiveness, and
capability of handling a job, to hold the positions they now are
in charge of. So, why can we not entrust them with the respon-
sibility of making the selections of nominees? Why do we
belittle their authority and cause dissensioii? ,

Perhaps an answer might be found in politics. played in pre-
ceding elections. Perhaps the war can be blamed——it causes
everything else to take on an unstable nature. Perhaps, if we
are brave enough, we can blame ourselves for the deplorable
state of affairs, the necessity of “pulling strings” at secret meet-
ings. Perhaps, if we had the courage, we would realize that by
participating in these subversive movements, we are only de-
feating every purpose of the whole procedure of suffrage.

In summation, today at women’s election, and next Wed-
nesday at men’s elections, let us consider the nominees from a
rational, unemotional, objective point of view. It is not a
question of whether the nominee is your fraternity brother or

I sister; it is not a case of loyalty to a friend of a friend. It is
the casting of a ballot for the person you believe the most
thoroughly capable of assuming responsibility; it is the casting
of a ballot for an honest, upright individual who fulﬁlls the re-
quirements of leadership in scholarship, character, ‘and person-
ality; it is the casting of a ballot for a person who Wlll formulate

the plans for your future. Betty Wolfe. .

[Read As You Run]

Feeling even more uninspired
than I usually do on Thursdays
whena column has to be written,
and all tied up with Infantry con-
certs and what have you, I’m go-
ing to cheat a little and print some
of my brother’s stuff. He’s funnier
than I am any day. (“Hear,
hear!” from Rosencrans.) Further-
more, Germany is far enough away
so that there won’t be any disa-
greeable repercussions like those
which followed that ill-fated arti-
cle about my sister. (It seems
she’s killed people for less than
that.)

Since most of the verses which
Donald has sent me are in Ger-
man, French, Scottish dialect, or
Runic (honestl), I’ll skip them,
and passing up an intriguing lit-
tle fragment which reads:

“Our subscribers were fed

called
THE WORMWOOD BLUES
You’re the ﬂy in my ointment,

You’re the squeak in my door,
You’re my big disappointment,

You’re the one I abhor;

You’re the spook in my mansion,
You’re the tack on my chair,
You’re the odd foot in my scansion,

You’re the bat in my hair;
You’re the mouse in my drawer,

dear,

You’re the roach in my sink,
You’re the neighborhood bore, dear,
You’re the moths in my mink;

You’re my radio’s static,

You’re the loose step in my stair,
You’re the wasps in my attic,

You’re the worm in my pear;
You make bric—a-brac dusty,

You make scatter rugs skid,
You let the hinges get rusty,

You’re the dime under a grid;
You’re the stone in my hoof, dear,

You’re the leak in my pail,
You’re the drip from my roof, dear,

You’re that sticking-out nail;
You’re the knot in my shoelace,

You’re a ﬂit-immune bug,
You’re my favorite two-face,

You eat holes in my rug;

You make potato bugs thrive, dear,

You’re the dog nipping my heels,
You’re‘the slice in my drive, dear,

You’re the accomplice that

squeals;
You’re the mosquito I nourish,

You’re the ﬂea I support,

You help nettles to ﬂourish,

You steal my favorite retort;

You’re the scooter I trip on,

You leave the tools in the rain,
You ice the pavements I slip on,

You taint" my food with ptomaine.

Letter To Editor

To the Editor,

This has been bothering me for
a long time, so I’m taking this
chance to get it off my mind. The
Twelfth ﬂoor-—I think every one
is agreed. that basically it's. a won-
derful plan, and a very‘ necessary
one, too. We need a place to relax
in—but when I say a place to re-
lax in I mean a place where I can
let down my hair, take off my
shoes, put my feet on the arms of
the chairs, have a cigarette, play
gin rummy, or just generally take
life easy. I think that is what we
want and need. But, from the
present plans, as I understand
them, that is not what we are get-
ting. Three inch rugs and paneled
walls might be very impressive to
visitors, but they certainly are
not conducive to inform-ality.
There is enough formality in the
Commons room, and the Nation-
ality rooms, where it belongs-
we don’t want it in the Twelfth
ﬂoor.
women at Pitt during the fund
raising campaign was poor, main-
ly because the women felt that
they would prefer the Tuck shops
to a Twelfth ﬂoor that duplicates
the atmosphere -of the Commons
room.

Perhaps I have misunderstood
the details of the plan. If I have,
even after looking into the matter
rather carefully, then there are
many other girls who have not in-
vestigated, and who are undoubt-
edly under the same misapprehen-
sions. If this is so, then a deﬁnite
statement from the committee as
to the exac-t plan for the Twelfth
ﬂoor will clarify matters in every-
one’s mind.

Sincerely,
Alice Soﬁs.

Ed. note: Miss Soﬁs, like many
others is not quite clear on the
plans for the 12th floor. Although
she has raised $125 towards the
fund, she thinks a declaration of
proposed plans is necessary to
help further the drive.

The engineers’ dance will be
held two days from now, Friday,
April 13. Bill Ross, president of
the Engineering and Mines asso-
ciation, has asked me to put in the

ﬁnali plug. Chairmen and commit-_

tee members have asked for the
whole-hearted cooperation of the
students, and as of Monday o.f this
week, ticket sales were going
fairly well.

You’re doing all right, gang.
Could we do .a little
though?

There are six more weeks of

school left before exams. In those .

six weeks, we will ha-ve two
dances—-the “Slide ‘Rule Swing”
and Panhel Ball. There seems to
be no question concerning the suc-
cess and support of Panhel. Every-
one hopes you’ll really beat up a
crowd for the engineers’ ﬂing, too.
It is the proud boast of the engi-

neers that they have never had ‘

a dance that has lost money. Pre-
vailing conditions, not only at
Pitt but at other universities and
colleges throughout the country,
have made dance propositions deli-
cate matters.

With two orchestras as features
and a ball room such as the Wil-
liam Penn’-s, the engineers have
gone way out and are carrying

mor-e than a minor responsibility. ‘

If their afliair is ﬁnancially in the
red, Pitt students might as well
wave farewell to all thoughts of
future dances.

Understand, pliz, that no one is
putting a gun in your back or

forcing a dance ticket into your 

unwilling hand. But if you have a
date Friday evening, don’t go
somewhere else for your good

time. And, ferhevvinsake, don’t 

sit at home! There will be plenty
of time for that in between the
“Slide Rule Swing” and Panhel
Ball. And then you’ll have a sum-
mer’s vacation without any Pitt
dances.

The gist of these no.t-so-subtle
remarks is that the engineers want
all you gals and fellas at the Wil-
liam Penn Friday evening, but
deﬁnitely. Exams are coming up

in six more weeks, as has been ‘ A

stated before, but (ahem!) i you
won’t start studying for those until
Monday, will you?

Freshmen Attend
Luncheon Today

Because few February freshmen
were able to attend the regularly
scheduled and traditional Customs
Brunch last Saturday, the Customs
committee has planned a lunch for
this afternoon at 12:30 o’clock in
the cafeteria. All freshmen, sen-
ior mentors, and Customs commit-
tee members are asked to attend.

Tables will be reserved, and
each girl will pay for her own
lunch.

The tradition of the Customs

Brunch ha-s been broken for the»
ﬁrst time. This h-as been the time-

when freshmen took off their blue
and gold arm-bands and become

full-ﬂedged members -of Pitt. This:

A

ceremony will be carried out dur-

ing today’s luncheon. -
“We hope that freshmen will
find it convenient to attend this
time, so that we can really make
them Pittites by taking off‘ the
armbands,” said Mary Jane Med-'
ley, Ed, chairman of the Custorris
committee. "

YWCA Convention Welcomes

All University Women

All women students who wish to attend the “National YWCA

Convention at Home” are urged to
Cathedral by 3:30 o’clock today. It

sign up in the YW oﬂice at 1204
is imperative that those who plan

to attend give advance notice to Mrs. Batz, director of the student
YWCA, so that the convention machinery may run smoothly.

, To be discussed at the convention are the problems of ﬁnan-cing,
leadership in local organizations, and work in the foreign ﬁeld. All

of these topics will be related to¢

the central theme for the year,
“The Times Demand.”

The discussion program and
voting for National board will

take place at the Business Girls’
loun-ge operated by the Pittsburgh
YWCA in the Granite building on
Sixth street Sat-urday, April 14,
from 2 until 8' o’clock. Supper will
be served at the convention for
a fee -of 50 cents.

Any woman student, whether
she belongs to the student YWCA
or not, is invited to attend the
convention, although only accred-
it-ed delegates will be permitted
to vote. The opening of the con-
vention to others than members
has been facilitated so that all
students will ‘have a chance to
discuss the issues which will aﬁect
the post-war condition of their
country.

Of particular interest to uni-
versity students will be the dis-
cussions -on the racia.l question
which are expected to point up
and clarify current thinking on
the problem. Material for discus-
sion will be taken largely from
the recently printed pamphlet,
Inter-racial Practices in the Com-
munity YWCA.

Also of interest will be the un-
derground movement in relation
to the Y’s in Europe. -Reports from

Le Circles Aids
French Relief

First consignment of used cloth-
ing and shoes for their spring
drive has been turned over by the
French club to the French com-
mittee for the city. The consign-
memt included wool dresses, wool-
en sweaters, pajamas, blouses, and
coats, all in “unusually goo-d con-
dition,” according to Miss Blos-
som Henry, Chairman of the drive.
Two fur coats were contributed by
members of the faculty who have
promised -to give shoes and suits.

The YWCA is cooperating in
the drive by contributing wool,
part of which has already been
knitted into coats, sweaters, gloves,
and afghans by members of the
French Club. The Central YWCA
is contributing layettes.

Th-ese goods are turned over by
the French club to the City com-
mittee which in turn sends the
clothing to Lisbon. From there
they are shipped to Geneva where
they are given to the Interna-
tional Red Cross which distributes
them in France. All kinds of used
clothing and all kinds of shoes
except heeled ones are wanted.
Clothes should either be taken to
Miss Henry’s office, 2927, the
YWCA -oﬂice, 12th ﬂoor, or the
Post Otﬁce if they are wrapped
and addressed to Miss Henry.

For Education

The “right combination” of
work and school is illustrated by
Walt Stewart, "E. Walt, a junior in
the School of Engineering, is com-
bining going to school with work-
ing at Mellon institute.

As a mechanical engineer at the
institute, he is conducting experi-
ments on lubrication an-d test en-
gine procedure. Having gathered
enough data for his undergraduate
thesis, he is now working on a
problem for his master's thesis.
This concerns, as Walt puts it,
“trying to devise a mechanical
means -of controlling oil consump-
tion without producing abnormal
effects which interfere with test
wor .”

In his spare time, (which is al-
most non-existent) he can be
found at the Delta Tau Delta
House. A member of Phi Eta Sig-
ma during his freshman year,
Walt is now treasurer of Sigma
Tau, engineering fraternity.

Having been graduated from
Penn High at the end of three and
one-half years to enter Pitt, he
returned there in June, 1943 to
receive his diploma, before start-
ing at the institute, Walt held a
variety of jobs ranging from
clerking to caddying.

As a member of the Society of
American Student Mechanical En-
gineers, he is keeping in close
t-ouch with the various happenings
in his chosen profession. In reply
to “Gosh, combining school and
work must keep you awfully
busy,” Walt says simply that he
is grateful to the student employ-
ment service for getting him a
job where he could arrange his
working time to ﬁt his schedule
of classes.

In Monroe Contest

Demetra Spanos, C, placed third in The Sv/n—Teleg'raph-sponsored
James Monroe Oratorical Contest, April 6, winning a $75 War Bond,
“Deemie” won her place in the inter-city-college ﬁnals by discussing
Woodrow Wilson’s idea of applying the Monroe Doctrine on an inter-
national, rather than on a national scope, proposed in a speech Janu-

ary, 1917.

among the six contestants, all girls.

She was handicapped by drawing ﬁrst speaking position

Her six-minute speech was

  

Drumm Leads

judged on personality, presenta-
tion, and content.

Deemie has ‘had a great deal
of previous experience in writing
and speaking. She has spoken in
most of Pittsburgh public schools,
Kiwanis clubs, and PTA meetings
on behalf of Junior Achievement,
a youth organization sponsored by
Businessmen of America, whose
aim is to .give youth a chance to
get experience in ﬁelds ‘in which
they are interested.

Ra-dio -work occupies much of
her time. She belongs to Radio
Youth Incorporated, a branch of
Junior Achievement. She does
script-writing and has had sev-
eral shows produced over local
stations. A Christmas fantasy for
children which she wrote was pre-
sented by Radio Youth over
KDKA. Her script on George
Washington Carver, produced
over WWSW, was used by the
national Carver committee in
the city public schools. She has
also written a yet-unproduced
script on Stephen Foster at the
request of the University. At
present she is adapting “With
Riﬂe an-d Plow,” short stories of
Western Pennsylvania, in thir-
teen scripts.

An advanced freshman, Deemie
likes Pitt" for “its profs and its
broad-minded attitudes.” Two of
her sisters go to Pitt, the older
one, Miss Bebe Spanos being a
graduate assistant in English. She
plans to make writing her career
and will probably major in Eng-
lish. She has already written
some short stories for children in
addition to her script writing.
When she -came to Pitt, at the
beginning of the present semester,
the girl in the registrar’s ofﬁce
read off English teachers’ names
and asked her how she would like
to have Miss Spanos. “I’m related
to her,” said Deemie. “How close-
ly?” inquired the girl. “Too close
for comfort in her class,” said
Deemie as sh-e rushed to the next
name on the list.

She is unique in that she does
not like movies. She does like to
bite her ﬁngernails, sit in lec-
tures with her mouth hanging
open, and do things that she
should, but that she does not have
time for. As :for men, quote, “I
love them all.”

By Ursula Halloran

Be it known that this week we
have christened our own beloved
Pittpourri the Tombstone Section
of the Pitt News.

The biggest scoop of the week
is the one about the Delt who went
to Penn State for a big week-end
and landed a hep date in the form
of a retired Peruvian native ar-
rayed in a low-cut soroyan——blue
shawl with her hair dressed in
Australian bear grease. Speaking
of week ends, we hear Norman
Weissman slept through a very in-
teresting one.

Friday nite at the Anchorage
gave us, as usual, many unprint-
able stories. Perhaps it would be
best if we just passed over it light-
ly by saying that every one has
something to “Hyde.”

Also big time Friday night was
the party the underclass phys—ed
majors threw for the seniors.
Ruth Czapiewski stood out in the
imitation of the Andrews sisters.
Jean Dorﬁeld, Polly Austin, and
Ellene Shaw danced specialty
dances—sounds intriguing. In
fact, the thing was so good that
they’re thinking of putting on the
show again.

At the nurse’s shindig at Alle-
gheny General the SAEs dreamed
up two original songs and warbled
them to the nurses. The gals all

. swooned.

Triangling now are Hank Ashe,
Ann Guyrisin, and Ed Longe-
baugh. Latest development was
just before Ann’s last date with
Hank. She got an anonymous
phone call, saying that Hank was
in the hospital with appendicitis.
Ten. minutes later Hank walked
in!!!

Another three-cornered d i s c
came to light on Thursday after-
noon at the Theta open house,
where there was tension surround-
ing Jim Reber, Jo Ann Magee,
and Jack Scullen.

and Dick Barnhart

These threesomes include Jim
Johns, and Georgette Zinsser, 0!‘
——why didn’t Melba Johns go to
Penn State over the week-end.

We have but one pining to ‘re-
port this week. SAE John Jacoby
has given his pledge pin to Phi Mu
Jean Dorﬁeld, but we’re watching
the Loretta Snyder-Dick Ames-
bury ro/‘mance, TPA and Phi Delt
respectively.

Five new members have been
admitted to the Foster Hall Union,
Tempas, Matlack, Levy, Rauh, and
Waite. The honorary president
officiated and the usual formal re-
ception was followed by a look at
Foster’s body.

Hold the fort!! Bud Lenchner is
coming home. Dear Unhappy:
Don’t you think you ought to let
Lenchner be guest editor of Frat
Facts during the week he is home,
just to give Pitt students that long
lost atmosphere of culture which
used to pervade the pages of the
Pitt News. A

Speaking of Steinman, have you
seen Arnie (The Green Hornet), in
his zoot suit of green? He claims
it cost sixty bucks?? Someone
told us he saw one just like it at
the Salvation Army for $4.72-
with hat and shoes to match.
HLWEVEF, Arnie doesn’t wear the
shoes because they have straight
toes instead of curled ones with
little bells on the end. He’s wear-
ing purple shoes with a stocking
cap to match. The suit is equipped
with a push button which releases
his long “doggie chain.” And as a
ﬁnal feature, the suit has an at-
tached pair of dark glasses which
light up and say, “I am Arnold
Steinman. Autographs form 4 to
6.” ‘ ‘

Goodbye for now, we are going
to retire to our mole-eaten cave
under Lilly Court, where we are
starting a concession to compete
with the Commons Room Tea.
See ya.

Zlbout Ohio

State

By Joy Gluck

What do you know about other

‘campuses? Our Pitt News man,
Arnold Steinman,

-visited Ohio
State university recently and has
come back with “week-end im-

, pressions”‘ of the University and

campus for Pitt students.
Beginning with an over-all pic-
ture of Ohio State university, we
ﬁnd that there are 75 buildings
providing accommodations for ap-

/proximately 6,500 students.

On the campus, the center of
University traditions is Mirror
lake. Here generations of students
have conducted initiations, held
“sings,” and hear-d concerts. “Of
special interest,” Arnie said, “are
the radio‘ station WOSU operated
by Ohio S=tate, and the Univer-
sity airport—a tract of 400 acres
located seven miles north of the
campus.”

When we asked, “What about
eating places?” we were told that
Ohio State has no “Tuck shops.”

"There are no special eating places

on --the campus ‘because most of
the men and women go to their
fraternity houses for meals. But
there ‘are several college “hang-
outs” located next to and around
the actual campus. “The off-cam-
pus hangouts serve as one illus-
tration of how the whole city of
‘Columbus -centers around the
campus and the student’s con-
venience,” Arnie ‘said. “In fact,”
"he said, “last November during
the Pitt-Ohio State football game,
-the picture at a local movie was
-interrupted so that the score could
be announced.” The Ohio State
student doesn’.t worry about trans-
‘portation. For his convenience,
Columbus has an excellent cab
«system. The street car system is
good too. Any point in the city
can be reached by street car. An
individual fare is six cents; strip
tickets are sold six for 25 cents!

As for socializing on the cam-
pus, Arnie thinks the Ohio State
student is at a disadvantage. The
‘enrollment is _. so large and the
buildings are so far apart, there
is little opportunity for knowing
large groups on campus, while at
Pitt with its centralization of
buildings and smaller enrollment,

there is a greater opportunity for

students to know most of the other
people .at school. At Ohio State,
‘students only ‘knowthe people in
their immediate social group——and
social life centers around the fra-
ternity group. Yearly social cal-
endars are planned including solid
week-ends of planned affairs. All
Sororities on campus hold open
house every Sunday. Arnie tells

of a custom among fraternities
which has become a tradition.

Every newly initiated member of

a sorority or fraternity is- visited
by the members of other sorori-
ties and fraternitigs and is con-
gratulated. The girls are congrat-
ulated by the fraternity men by
receiving a “great, big kiss” from
each of them! “Just ‘a few of the
many customs that make for
longer remembrance of school
days,” Arnie said.

There are about 5'0 men’s and
women’s fraternities, all loca-ted
withinseveral blocks of the cam-
pus. Before the war most Co-
lumbus residents at - Ohio State
didn’t join fraternities, and even
today, although Columbus men
are admitted to fraternities, Co-
lumbus women usually don’t get
into sororities. Arnie found that
visitors are welcomed royally at
the fraternity houses. “For a visit-
or from another campus,” he said,
“it is always ‘rush week’ at the
fraternity houses.” '

As to fraternity «politics, each
class has its own class officers.
Politics enter only once a year,
in the spring, when political par-
ties and campaigns are organized.

Speeches .are given from the plat-
form a-n-d over their radio station,
WO.SU. There are banners and
posters-—a general frenzied “all
out” effort. “But a-fter the elec-
tions politics are forgotten until
the next year. There is no all year
round campaigning going on,”
Arnie said. Politics and other in-
ter-fraternity disputes that arise
over rushing on other campuses
are largely avoided at Ohio State
because the University has open
rushing-—the fraternity’ that sees
the freshman first usually gets
him because he is kept away from
other fraternities—-“A cut-throat
system of rushing,” Arnie called it.

To our question of “How is Ohio
State school spirit?”, Arnie re-
plied, “Wonderful.”

The Ohio State Lantern, the
daily paper, is not an extra-cur-
ricular activity but ‘staffed ‘by
journalism students who are grad-
ed. on their work on the paper.
There is a different staff for every
day of the week, and one editor-
in--chief for-the year. Other pub-

lications include a quarterly put ‘

out by the University, The Ohio
State University News, and the
yearbook an-d humor magazine
which are extra-curri-cular activi-
ties.

All that in one week end! Class
dismissed!

csiiss-E FADS’

AND FANCIES,

CLASS or 1850

Fads and fancies in college costumes are by
no means modern phenomena. Here is a
gay undergraduate of the Class of 1850.
Observe his ﬂowing collar and tie, his super
expanse of Panama brim, and his studied

air of nonchalance.

This was in 1850, when America was
basking in peace. The Golden West was
opening up, and Express Service was keep-
ing pace. Today, there are few fads and fan-
cies on the college campus. They have given
place to the uniformity and eﬂiciencies of
war time. Thousands of students are con-
centrated on the needs of the nation in arms.

Railway Express is devoting its nation-
wide services, both rail and air, primarily
to speeding war materiel. To help all con-
cerned, you can do three simple things with
your 1945 home packages and baggage:
Pack securely — address , clearly and ade-
quately — avoid abbreviating state names.

Kaps could be found at the Sena-
tor theater resting up for moving
day, May 1.

Hell week begins tonight for
the Sigma Chis and incidentally,
so does spring housecleaning. Lat-
est reports say that the Sigs are
making big plans. What for? Why
spring vacations, of course. '

The Phi Ep pledge affair was
held Saturday in Ligonier. Among
those enjoying the outdoor life
were brothers Morty .- Seltman
and Mel Ble-iberg from the navy,
a/c .Mel Steinberg from the air

corps, and Lt. Philip Dutch from -

the army. Weisman (who always
seems to make this column) slept.

The annual “Pig Dinner” drew
several of Pitt’s Phi Gams to
Western Reserve at Cleveland for
a meeting of 10 colleges and uni-
versity Phi Gam chapters.

The SAEs went in full force to
Allegheny General -hospital to at-
tend a dance held by the nurses
up there. Two other important
facts are (1) last week George
Polimus was initiated into broth-
erhood, (2) the SAE lions were
ﬁnally paintedwhite. ‘

About twelve of the Delts took
a trip to Penn State last week
end. As usual on the trip back,
’Buell’s car broke down and it
took over six hours‘ to get back
into Pittsburgh. T

The PIKA’s had a little party out
at the Anchorage last Friday

V- night in hon-or of their new of-

ficers. Bob Nagel is the new pres-
ident, Vincent Stufft, vice presi-
dent, Jack Valentine, secretary,
and Bob Harper, treasurer.

Surprise—Nothing to report on
the Pi Lams this week.

PiKAs Lose
28-23; 3-Way
Tie for Second

Finally, after several weeks of
waiting, the I-F Basketball Cham-
pionship has been decided. The
SAE’s took the trophy by defeat-
ing a hard ﬁghting PiKA team
28-23.

The runner-up -position is still
undecided between the Phi Eps,
Phi Gains, and Pi Lams, There
probably will be play-off‘ games to
settle the dispute for second place.

The ﬁnal standing of the top
teams in the I-F basketball race
is as follows: ‘

Team Won _Lost
Sigma Alpha Epsilon . . 7 1
Phi Epsilon Pi . . . . . .. 6 2
Phi Gamma Delta  6 2
Pi Lambda ‘Phi . . . . . . . 6 2
Pi Kappa Alpha . . . . . . 5 3

The championship tilt started off
with Gallagher of the PiKA’s
sinking a ﬁeld goal from under the
hoop. This was followed up by a
one hand shot of Valincik’s from
behind the foul line and then a

‘foul, making the score -5-0. Gal-
. lagher and Valincik each received

fouls in short succession, giving
them a lead of 7 points._The SAE’s
broke into the scoring column
when»Kosh sank a two-pointer
from ‘the corner of the court.
Dimittroﬁ received a foul as the
quarter ended with the score 7-3
in favor of the PiKA’s.

The‘ SAE’s began to move back
into the ball game by"scoring two
ﬁeld goals and tying up the game.
Both teams seesawed back and

forth during the second period,
but the half ended with the
PiKA’s leading by 2 points, the
score being 14-12.

The second half told a different
story about the championship
match. The SAE’s came out as a
new team, out—shooting, out-pass-

“Y” Suﬁers First Loss

The YMCA basketball team suf-
fered its first setback of the season
last March 27 at Trees Gym
when a powerful‘ Pi Lam team
whipped them 40-27. The Pi Lams,
late season favorites in the hectic
I-F league, showed ﬂashes of
speed and skill that stamped them
as one of the top teams in the I-F
League.

;Beck with 16 points was high-
scorer and led the Pi Lam attack.
Balisky with six points was top
man for the “Y”.

I-F Athletic Chairman, Les
Sarles, has tentatively agreed to
a post-season game, between the
I-F champions and the “Y”

Panther Nine Cards
6 Games For Season

On May 5th, the Panthers open
their annual spring eastern so-
journ with a tilt at State College,
Pa., meeting Penn State’s Lions.
The Blue and Gold then entrain
for Annapolis where they will en-
counter the Middies of Navy on
May 9. Following this on May 12,
the Pitt squad meets Bucknell on
the Bison’s home-grounds‘. The
Panthers play two home contests
on May 16 and 19 when they have
return engagements with Buck-
nell and Penn State respectively.
The bobtail card is completed» on
June 2 when Coach Mitterling
sends his men against the all-pow-
erful Army squad. The game will
be played at West Point.

Contests with Juniata and St.
Vincent’s had to be cancelled since
these schools decided to drop the
sport for this season. Of the four
opponents to be met, all were on
the Panther’s card last spring.

* * =1:

With a month left to go before
the season lidlifter, Coach Ralph
-Mitterling has been sending his
Panther nine through regular

fundamental drills. The unpre-
dictable weather has been keeping
the squad off the stadium dia-
mond for a few days each week,
and indoor drills have been held
instead. Inﬁeld and bunting drills
have been the order of the day as
a key to conditioning the Pan-
thermen. A few intra-squad games
have been held, and more are com-
ing, to enable the Pitt mentor to
get a line on his prospects.
Much shifting around and
shuﬂiing of lineups are in store
but so far Mitterling has been us-
ing Fassio and. Baur behind the
bat;. hurling assignments have
been handled by Lucchino, Klein,
Dobies, McClure -and Lebovitz. In
the inﬁeld, Marsiglio has held
down the initial sack, tiny Al Ma-
nerino and gridder “Red” Mat-
thews have been handling second
with ‘Sam Consentino at third and
Delancey in shortﬁeld. Consentino
is also a catcher. Roaming the out-
ﬁeld pastures have been Zim-
rnovan and Reppert in left, Joe
Kielb in center and Pager and
Johns alternating in right.

Pitt Teams Schedule
First Spring Drills

By Larry Bondy
lif practice makes perfect, this year’s Pitt ﬂoor squad and
football team should have theintricacies of the games mastered.
Dr. H. C. Carlson has planned a two-week practice session
for those who wish to represent the Blue and Gold on the basket-
ball court next season. Sessions will be held the last two weeks
of April or the last week of April and the ﬁrst in May. This
marks the ﬁrst spring training foi¢
the cage team since pre-war days.
Approximately 20 students are
expected to join in the practice
scheduled on the Stadium turf
when weather permits or else in
the gym. The program will con-
sist of passing, running, and learn-

Carlson believes this pre-season
training will develop coordination,

chance to end up with a .500
average. Backﬁeld men who are
slated for duty again this year are
George Linelli, Don Matthews, the
small back that did plenty of ball
carrying, Johnny Lozar, and John
Kosh, one of the punters. The line
will be a hard one to break
through with Fran Mattioli, Navy
Trainee and star guard on the Pitt
eleven backing it up. Fran had
All—American honors in his grasp
last season but a back injury in
the Bethany game put him in the
hospital. Others hoping to keep
the enemy out of our backﬁeld are
Ends Jay Brown, Roussos, Ed Zim-
movan and Peyton, Guards George
Ranii and Polach, and Tackle Joe
DeFrank.

The picture at the present looks
very bright. As long as the Army
and Navy let the boys alone, and
with the possibility of getting some
discharged vets and 17-year olds,
the Panthers might again ﬁeld a
winning ball club.

Clark Shaughnessy expects to
get football practice underway
mid-way in. June, with the bright-
est future since he became skipper
at the Skyscraper college. Last
year’s team ended up with a .400
mark as they faced a schedule
jammed with top teams of the
country. Army, Notre Dame, Illi-

tually steam—rolled over them
while the hapless Jungle Cats took

Field, and Penn State.

Pitt High In
First Results

With three of the four ﬁring
stages already completed in the
all-important National F i r i n 1;
Match, excitement and tension has
increased among everyone con-
nected with the Pitt Riﬂe Team.

Inci-dentally, the hardest of the
four positions is the prone-stand-
ing position. For this stage the
Pitt Team ﬁred a score of 1826.
Although this score does not seem
signiﬁcantly high, a comparison
with the winning score of last
year’s champion, Culver, shows
a favorable total for the third
stage. _In 1944 Culver ﬁred a
score of 1791 for the third part.

Pitt has an 1826 scored in this
year’s match.

As a further comparison with
Culver for the first three ﬁring
stages Pitt has a somewhat better
average.

151: 2nd 3rd
Culver . . . . .1965 1897 1791
Pitt . . . . . . . .1962 1932 1826

Surprising as it may seem, three
boys have once again ﬁred perfect
100 scores in the Prone Position.
They are: Harry Herlinger, Wil-
liam Rainies, and Oliver Keller. Of
the three, Keller is the most sur-
prising scorer for he is only a
freshman and this is his ﬁrst year
on the_Riﬂe ‘Team. '

Thus far no other scores from
the competing teams have been
released and probably will not be
for another two weeks, until the
Match is over. Until that time all
the men on the 14th ﬂ-oor are
keeping their ﬁngers crossed and
hoping for the best.

Spring’s answered one question for Mitterling’s men -—
when thcy’ll get outside to play some real ball. ’I‘hey’ve left their
dingy, cramped, sub-stadium practice ﬁeld for the sun—swept
spaciousnoss of the stadium itself. No more just warming up,
looking into the sliding pit, trying to follow some wild-fast baller

 

 

, It’s just as easy to produce a win-

in hunting practice—~now they hold batting drills, snappy in-
ﬁeld practices, while intra—squad games shape up in the near

future.
=k #

=8 =3

But that’s neither the biggest nor m.ost important issue

facing the team and its coach this fourth War—time year. The .
real question is, “Will we break our losing streak?”

The

Panthers haven’t come out on the¢
long end of a score for the last
two years. Bucknell, Juniata,
Penn State, Army, and Navy have
all taken turns belting the Pitt
boys around and piling up for
them an eleven-game, two-year
losing skein.
* =1! *

What’s the trouble? Why are
we the laughing stock of the col-
legiate diamond? Is it the team?
Is it the coach? Is it our atti-
tude? Or, maybe a combination
of all three? I don’t know, but
to try and pass it off with the
answer that these are unusual
times is pitifully weak and hol-
low—soun-ding. Losing to star-
studded Army and Navy is cer-
tainly no disgrace, but taking it
on the chin from a midget like
Juniata is a little ludicrous. Is it
that the boys don’t particularly
care? If not, WHY? To be a
winning combination we’ve got to
have a smooth working outﬁt
where both coach and players are
out to win. If that’s been lacking
up to now, let’s get it ironed out
before this season’s under way.

ner as to ﬁeld a mediocre team
and we’re capable of a winner.
To lose consistently means putting
a crimp in school prestige and a
damper on the spirit of the student
body. How about that winner?
* * *

With Johnny Lozar, Red Mat-
thews, Joe Kielb, and Ray Reppert
back from last year's squad, there’s
a nucleus of veterans to build

around. Then, a pair of freshmen,
Bob Luccinoand Virg Fassio, have
shown up well in practice and
loom as the‘ ﬁrst-string battery.
They’ve been together since high
school days when they brought
South Hills High a city champion-
ship. Stocky Bob’s a lefty with a
cracking fast ball and a sharp-
breaking curve who has the poise
of a vet“ out there on the mound.
* * *

Things are shaping up mighty
nicely. If the team shows the form
and class they’ve sported in these
pre-season drills, when the season
does roll around, there’s no rea-
son why Pitt can’t take care of‘
most of her opponents and even
give the elite of the collegiate cir-
cuit, Arriny and Navy, 21 real run
for their money.
boys and their coach, working to-
gether to put across a successful
year. They can do it. Just don’t

Clothing Drive
In Progress

The Pittsburgh and ,Allegheny
County drive of the United Na-
tional Clothing Collection is now
in progress under the general
chairmanship of Mark van der
Kloet.

Mayor C. D. Scully issued a
proclamation over all five Pitts-
burgh radio stations asking the
cooperation of all citizens in con-
tributing used clothing to be ship-
ped to all the liberated countries
of the world. A quota of at least
ﬁve pounds of used clothing per
person is -bei.ng asked, in the
hope that Pittsburgh and Alle-
gheny county will be one of the
record—breaking communities

Sunday, April 22, has been des-
ignated as the county-wide house-
to-house pick-up day. During the
month, there will be collection
centers throughout the city and
county where donations of cloth-
ing may be brought before the
pick-up day.

Hdok, Line, and iisankerf 3' A

By Tillie Sanker

Have you ever noticed how a
girl’s personality is reﬂected in
her leg paint? Those who like to
be the center of attention usually
apply it profusely until their limbs
become the shade of freshly cured
cowhide. This is a sure way of
attracting attention. Then there is
the “mousey”‘ or shy type. This
type barely skims the surface,
hardly touching the legs, so as
not to be noticed. The result is a
cross -between a high water mark
and a case of freckles. So in the
hope that the guilty ones will be
able to strike a happy medium,
Sanker gives you advice in death-
less verse:

In summer time, the use of leg
paint 1 '

Is a custom deemed both cute and‘

and quaint; ,
But please, oh, please, my lithe-
limbed lambs, '
Don’t’sm-'ea»‘r too much of the goo
on ydur gams.
