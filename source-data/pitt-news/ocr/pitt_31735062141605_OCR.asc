corporated under the New York mem-
bership co1po‘ra.tion law. Our monthly

usual big annual dinner is planned
for the early part of 1923.

“I have been greatly impressed by
the enthusiasm shown by those pres- A
ent at our first meeting, and by some
of the other members who were not
there, but with whom I ha.ve'talked

ment is nothing more than inspiring.
"‘In the past years we have bad

THE Lorus EATERS

  

 

The tendency towards _special_iza-
tion, which is the guidfng star of
American industrial and commercial
life,‘ is reﬂected everywhere ‘in. the
arts and sciences and even in. the
cloistered stud’es and ‘laboratories
of our‘, universities. and’ colleges.
Striving toward perfection in. theory
or ‘practice offa single corner of a
given ﬁeld of ‘endeavor undoubtedly
has a narrowing and cramping effect
on our mental life. We lose the in-
ﬂuence of a broad outlook, forgetting
how__to' . ' . n h .
“Walk with kings, nor lose. the’

common touch.” ’

Whether throttled. by ambition,-"or,
displaced by the pressing problems
of the day we gradually lose that
line, perception, developed by genera-
tion of dreamers‘ that is our right-
ful heritage. ’ ' - ’ '

«All the vast storehouse of art, -the
huge halls filled with music,fwhich
like the Aeolian bags of wind, are
striving to burst out, all the fecund
volumes of “the” ‘philosophers are -in
easy reach» of those to whose, care
they are intrustcd. ' ’ ' .
. The‘ peculair need of such a chan
nel for expression and appreciation
among university students is. quick-
ly seen when we glance at the type
and roster of the various Aorganiz'a-
tions that ﬁll-—though imperfectly——
the social life" of the student "body.
All «the societies and fraternities
cater 'to a‘ membership .which has
often only one overpowering hobby
or avocation, and ‘whose’ interests
are intense enough to be satisﬁed. by
intensive work in that particular
_.field, but not diffuse enough to re-
quire other stimuli. CThere is a. need
of an intellectualcommunism, ‘a free
ma-rt of ideas, fopinions, and even‘ of
moods. ‘An organization devoted ex.
clusively to this policy. ‘of awakening
‘general interest in‘ the_.humanities
and line arts would be of inestimable
value to the students of this univer-
sity. , . ' . ~
_ It is with this view of opening our
eyes to‘-‘the rich archives or thought
and work thatis imprisoned -in the
literature and art,‘ of calling forth
all the ‘rich fancies that may be hid-
den or discarded within us, of resist-
ing that unthinking drift toward a
mechanical view of "life, that there
has been proposed the establishment
of the..Lotus Eaters as an organiza-
tion 'of ‘Varsity students. . V
' _'I‘he. Lotus Eaters attracts. men
who have even an observer’-s inter-
est in ‘the many activities of humans.
True .. appreciation is. as difficult gig.
acquire as is proﬁcienc_y.;. the-,'art
of listening is as important as that
‘of action." The organization will be
simple in the . extreme. There will
be” no ‘officers or. dues, norlformal
programs. . "Whenever the members
feel the languor of the Lotus stealing
over them they will retire behind
clouds, of .blue tobacco smoke .to
drink Of Nepenthe and eat of':the
Lotus‘. One may be silent or dis-
course on any subjéct,— no matter
how evanescent or irrelevant it may
sound to sophisticated and practical
ears. The extent of our interest
will be as diverse as the several
minds of men, "as "boundless as Na-

 

ture. lndividualism will reign su-
preme. . » l _ V . . .
All of this...may be a beautiful

pipe dream, but maybe there is. a
train; of " truth._in_ it_.~—-University

-A.-rHouo.Hr .-on ivournh’

-Since the beginning of mankind.
youth has bowed. veneration to -old
age. In the earliest record of man,
we ﬁndthe fear. of the “old man" of
the tribe dominating every action or
thought of -youth." His wordjwasjlaw,
there was‘ nojquestioning of t.he mo-'
tive, right or wrong——he was .obey'ed.

And to.this day we have been blind-
ly-executing the ‘dictation of the eld-
ers. « - ' —
1 ~l7Vhy has -it-been"\so? ‘Do we still
have that primitive fear of the “old
man?” Is ‘youth afraid to think? Do
We shirk responsibility’? Doiwe lack
vision? Have we no--ideals? Toall
of these. uuestions we answer" with a
most emphatic NO.

The causes of our failure to take
part in world affairs-are two. In-_the—
ﬂrst place, our ideas have been ridie.
culed because they-came from youth:'
they -did not conform to the methods
employed by our elders, hence they
were rejected. The. second and most
important "cause is our own total lack
of interest. - ' _ -

Again. following in the footsteps of
‘our elders. we-have been contented to
-“have a good time’? in our youth; we
have waited until. our ideas‘ were
aroused. and then we have become
the “old men," have accepted their
traditions and- have imposed them
upon the youth of our day. . '

__ Now we ask who better than we can
create out of this chaotic society a
life that is built, not on the assump-
tion that we are perfect. but are only
on the road to perfecti'on_——a’ road that
is becoming more-_ and more impass-‘
able as it. is being ~travers'ed by men

‘THE. RIGHT ATTITUDE

THE COLLEGE ST _
- . ' ' “O'U'l"lN&LlF,E",_

 

The current opinion among stu-

college to “get an education.”
sumably so, ..but what is education?
Mayor" Moore——wasn’t it?-‘—.-informed
.us that “education is -civilization.” It

They, the individual students, formu-
late gorgeous and devastating plans
to be carr’ed__out after graduation. In

an obstreperous, spoiled youngster.

on WITH THE DANCE!‘

The college man has. always been
the object of blame where social

corned. He has always been blamed
for foolish male fadsand fashions,
but now the sages have acquired
the chimerical idea that the .“rah-
rah boy” is to blame for the origin
of “petting parties.” “bobbed-haired,
rolled-stockinged girls,” and the
“general moral degeneracy of jazz.”

Magazines and papers all over the
country have discussed the matter.
Several colleges’ admit‘ the criminal
tendencies of their pleasure-loving
students; others deny it. Finally,
one of our local beacons of enlight-
enment comes 'to the fore with" a
full page discussion, of the appro-bri-

at the conclusion-, ‘.‘Is jazz a menace,
a vehicle ‘for sensuality? Or is it
/ youtlrs revolt against restraint?
Does the mania for gambling and
underdressing signify degeneracy?"

Jazz is not a menace! It is the
modern expression of joy, and_ the

revolution ‘in youthful circles is con-.

ous behavior of John‘ J. Jazz, asking‘

fact that the. two sexes are; dra,wn~:

together‘ in its execution is incl-.
dental and notsigniﬁcent.
war camps, away from the influence
of women, jazz served to raise the
spirit of the down—hearted. Man has.
always,‘ and quite naturally, sought
the company of woman in pleasure.
She is an accessory, not the cause
of jazz dancing. ‘ 
Zvloclern dancing is imprescriptible.
It needs no repression and will stand‘
for none. There is, of-course,_'the,

.“ball-room bandit.” even as there are

extremists at all functions, who re‘-_
quire censure. “Petting parties” and
“hip-pocket heroes” are unknown
‘quantities to no college inﬁll. hilt
every such enthusiast exercises his
judgment in ,the presence or‘ the op-
posite sex.

gets the respect she demands. ' .~

Youth will be served! Is it not
better that he gives vent _to his ef-

Dean H. E. Friesell, of the Dental
School, has received the following re-

port made by Dr. J. L. Boots a grad-! opening one
i-uate of the Dental Schoolin 1917 and cases. Dr. 'McAnlis has a’ Korean im-

a member of the Dental Faculty on

leave of" absence to do missionary ‘

dental work in Korea. ,

Dr. Boots -is a well~known -graduate
of the Dental School and it was felt
that Iuanyof his friends in the Uni-
versity would be, interested in his ex-
periences in Korea, which ha.s re-
cently been, the seat of international
discussion because of the conflict be-
tween Japanese and Korean interests
there. ‘

The letter is somewhat detailed and
tells of Dr. Boots’ impressions of Ko-
rea, sndof his dental work, there as
a.‘ missionary in" “-the ‘dental depart-
ment} ‘ . -- ‘ 

The letter-follows: ' .

from home. A large welcoming crowd
of missionaries met us, took us_‘a_cros‘s
the city to the East Gate Compound
where we, were to; ‘stay for . three
months. The extentof mission work‘
in Seoul, the wide, -well-lighted
streets, the presence of ‘so many Jap-
anese were all surprises. The first of
April our daughter Jean.Matilda was
born and two weeks later we moved
into our present home on Severance
Compound‘ outside South Gate. “ I be

The - Dental ,Depa‘rtment_ _

“The dental department I found be-
ir.g_carlied on in awayby a Japanese
dentist and two Koreans. Since the
former dentist had ‘left, the ‘equipment
had depreciated to a pitiable "collec-
tion and both Japanese and.Koreans
were falling into the ruts and’ faults
of Japanese dentistry, in thought and
practice. It was necessary to have
plans for enlarged-offices, new equip_-
ment, the bringing of a second ‘and
possibly third dentist, investigation
of the dentalsituaticll of the foreign‘-
ers and the Koreans and Japanese.
We had to ﬁnd out how much den-
tistry is practiced, who ‘does it, ‘what
fees are charged, where equipment
and supplies can be bought and what
supplies of. A,1nerican,"-British‘, Ger-
man or Japanese manufacture‘ can
best be used ill‘ good‘ work. .

“The problem ..of personnel then
presented itself. Should we instruct

- only merlical students or could we

take in full’ ‘time dental students?
What instruction should be 1-’.iven?V
Should there, be an attempt to meet
the present emergency or should the
original plan for-language study be’
folloiveil, awaiting - the arrival of ‘a.
second dentist from America?

“The Japanese dentist leftgand‘-‘our
"second dentist came in the fall. 1111-
der the ﬁnancial support of. them-
stitutiorl. »--There have been some ‘dis-
collraging features, we must admit.‘
The foreign work, dental s‘ervice~to
m‘ission,aries, ' commercial and ‘diplo-
matic foreigners is more than enough
for one dentist, if he "does nothing
else. It is forced uponus in such a
wuy‘We cannot evade it yet the mis-
sion boards have not yet admitted
‘dentistry ‘as a nledical necessity ~01‘
to be on the same plan with medical
work. ‘ _ , . , p.

“The competition of the govern-
ment is not encouraging- I dislike to
compete -withithem yet ‘I -hate to. leave
the Koreans to quackery, for ‘there is"
neither desire nor gability: to give‘-the
people the " dental ‘surgery or. oral l1.v-:

“We, spent our 'ﬁlrst‘.i- summer at

there were many happy hours spent
with our children, ﬁshing, hiking,

“Before the summer was over we
visited one of the -great Buddhist
-temples and monasteries in the moun-
tains, besides milking numerous trips,
to the quai-nt fislling villas, learning,-
always learning, more of Korea and
the Koreans. The Montcalm,‘-. a French

bor and we enjoyed visiting it and in

“The month between summer and
the beginning of language school was
a. busy’ one. I -had planned to go with
ot-heir medicalmen liothe big opening
of the Rockefeller Institute in Peking
but‘ the new dentist was onllis way
here, the . Japanese dentist re-
signed and work (came in with a.,~rush.

Panthers, but Lafayette, which is un-
derfthe tutelage of Jock‘ Sutherland‘,
had betterluck and won from-‘Pitt by
one touchdown. Now, in Penn, an-
other eleven that is coached; by a" Pitt

is none other than Tommy,~Davies of
the Pitt‘ teams in 1918, 1919, 1920,
and 1921, who, although not head
coach at Penn, is given much credit
for the wonderful development of the
Penn backs. The ﬁne offe_nse,,m'any'

coaching of the -. former Pitt captain

‘ Penn has never beaten ‘Pitt, but
nearly did so several times.‘ In 1915,
the ﬁrst year of the ‘annual affairs
between Pennsylvania’s two biggest
universities, Pitt defeated Penn,”14-7.
The following year, when Pitt is cred-u
ited with having the best team that
ever played.‘ for a. university, Penn
was;defeated_, 20-0. In 1916, the Pan-
thers won another game by a one
touchdown margin, the ﬁnal score be-
ing 14-6. In_ 1918, the S. A. T. C. year-,

Penn was very easy for Pitt, who‘ won, '

37-0..» _In 1919‘, however, Pitt, for they

ﬁrst time, was unable, to beat Penn, l‘

the‘. game ending in -a 3-3 tie. The
next year Pitt almostfailed. again to

.narily spectacular “work by Tom Da-
vies who madethree touchdowns on‘-
abled Pitt to win out by a'27-21 score.

Lastseason, .Penn was easy for the
Panthers, the ﬁnal score being 28-0
in Pitt’s favor.~ The fact that-Penn.

these same people are advised to -re-.
vmember the. We_st Virginia team,
which, after losing to Pitt for 19 years,’
-ﬁnally won this season’ by a three

Pitt will probably be in much-bet-‘
ter ‘condition’ than she ‘has’ been"at
any timebefore. The easy game with
Geneva allowed the regulars who were
slightly injuredﬂto recuperate entirely

Saturday. ’ ‘ p

The Presidents, under the. leader-
ship of ‘Captain Brenkert, have built
up one of the strongest outﬁts in the
Eastern section and have at no time
been '-forced to taste bitter defeat.
Theyjupsert -all dope last Saturday
by setting back Sutherland’s proteges
-by a_ 14 to 13. score. Incidentally we
recall the. defeat ‘handed the Blue
and Gold by the ‘Eastern aggregation.

The rejuvenated. -Panther has ﬁnal-
ly gained its stride and will in the
future be a hard team to beat. VVarn-
er has slowly developed a green
team into one of the best in the
Eastern Conference and his War-
riors are «cpnﬁdent of taking the
Red and Black into camp when they
meet-* in the annual classic 21. Week
from Saturday.

Altliough little may be ‘ judged
from comparativ'e\=scores we may'\be‘
safe in saying -that the ‘whitewash
handed the Beaver Falls" Covenanters
by‘ the Pitt -squad»-was a greater vic-
tory than that which the Wash-Je-if

 

q .

team scored over the Geneva boys.

However, the Blue a.nd Gold will be
satisﬁed to earn a.o14; to .01 victory
over ‘the Presidents and .Warner_ has
the utmost ~conl”uie.nce tha't'_his_ pro-
teges will. come through. - Local
Wash-Jeff alumni‘ will be present in
full force at the ‘clash and Willbe
every-ready» to give. their team the
backingiand spirit necessary" to give
pep and -ﬁght to a, team. ‘ ‘

"The Panthers completely routed
Gen_ev.a College last Saturday" after-

noon by the score of 62-0. It has been
a long while since Pitt has ever beaten
any opponent on the football ﬁeld as
badly as Geneva was beaten. The
team looked better last Saturday after-
noon than at any time this season.
With the varsity lineup practically
intact for the opening kickoff it took
just seven plays to score’ the first
touchdown. Flanagan took a double
pass from Hewitt at the ﬁve yard
line for this score. Williams made a
nice placement kick fromthe 10-yard
line. The‘ next touchdown came as
the result of 2. Geneva fumble. Ge-
neva‘ ran back Pitt’s "kickoff to the
25 yard line. On the next play Klee
fumbled after making ﬁve yards
through the line and Gourley recov-
ered for Pitt. Hewitt made _the sec-
ond touchdown after four plays. Wi'l-

liams made.-the extra point by a place-.

,ment kick. ..
After Geneva returned the next
kickoffto their 25-yard line, Hamilton
broke away around left end for 29
yards; It was a beautifully executed
double pass from a punt formation.
After three plays Anderson intercept-
ed‘a forward pass and returned it to
the Geneva _45-yard line. After seven
more plays Flanagan went around
right endpfor 15 yards for the third
touchdown. ’ ’ ‘ .
At the beginning of the second quar-
ter 'Hudsqn of Geneva began some
good punting that kept the Panthers
-from -large gains." He was punting
for more than 50 yards. In this quar-
ter Geneva intercepted two forward
passes that stopped drives toward
their goal: line. In the middle of this
quarter, Wild missed a try for a ﬁeld
goal. Itxwas a neat attempt from
the 42-yard‘ line.‘ The ball hit about
two feet wide of its mark and about a
foot short. ' Late in this quarter Hud-

son punted from behind the goal line -'
to the 36-yard line. Here Pitt started -.
a drive that led-to the_‘only touchdown J

of the period. Johnson carried the

ball on nearly every play for at ﬁve ’

‘yard gain. Johnson carried the-. ball
across. Gwosden made the extra point
from placement. After a few plays
more the half ended. __

Pitt had seven new players in the
gameﬁat the beginningof the second
half. The ﬁfth. Pitt touchdownocame
from a drive that started from the
Pitt 41-yard line. Johnson did the bur-
den of the work in this drive. He
also kicked the goal for the extra
point. The team was not long in mak-
ing the next touchdown. Pitt kicked
-to Geneva and in three plays they
gained eight yards. Here Frank broke
through and blocked a punt, following
the ball to theeight-yard line Where
he picked it up and fell over the goal
line after Hudson made a desperate
effort to_ bringhim down. It was a
Pretty play. Evans kicked the goal
for. the” 42nd point. L V -

At the beginning of thefourth quar-
ter Flanagan and Anderson returned
tothe game in the places of Evans
and.‘Hartnett. Brockett of Geneva

fumbled the kickoff and Anderson of . '

Pitt recovered on the. 25-yard line.

‘Five plays brought the next. touch-.

down. Flanagan carr_ied the ball for
the ﬁnal fouryards around right end.
Rebman and -Gredel, Genevayguards,
were badly hurt in this drive and had
to be helped off the ﬁeld. ‘Anderson
missed thegoal. A little later Bohren
going over the goal line fumbled and
Lawrence recovered for ‘Geneva.
Bohrenhad run back an intercepted
forward pass for 30 yards just before
this. ‘ Shuler returned 21 Geneva punt
from the Pitt 45-yard line. to“ the
Geneva 11. Flanagan had a seven
yard -gain. and then Johnson‘ took it
over. Flanagan, Bohren, Shuler, and
Bowser carried the ball on the trip
for the last touchdown. Johnson made
the touchdown and kicked the goal.
All the ‘Pitt ‘men looked mighty,

to choose among them. Flanagan,
