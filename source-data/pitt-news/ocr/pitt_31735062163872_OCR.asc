IT WAS A DAY for the Civil Engineers Thurs-
day as they carted off laurels in two Engineers’
Week events. Theydefeated Electrical Engi-
neers in a, College Bowl contest Thursday
morning and tugged for a victory in “The Gim-

in the afternoon.

The double-triumph

gave the Civil Engineers at leg-up in the race
for the Shamrock Award which was presented
at Friday evening's dance.

“NAACP Probe Clears Club  

,To' clear up the situation James L. Kunkle,
general manager of the club, explained that

An investigation of the service and membership

University’s chapter of the NAACP has revealed
that anyone, regardless of race or religion, who is
invited by a member of the Club, may be served
The refusal to serve Councilman James
Jordan, a Negro, at the club over a year ago served

there.

as impetus for the investigation.

When the investigation was begun, according
to Ralph Proctor, president of the University’s-
chapter of the NAACP, the club's policies were
clouded in obscurity. Even faculty members were
confused as to whether or not Negroes would be

served there.

Negroes. are served in either the main dining

room or the side dining rooms. ~

He pointed out that the Jordan incident had
occurred because of the laxity of the general man-
ager of the club at the time" in enforcing non-dis—'
criminatory behavior among the staff personnel.

According to Dr. S. Harris Johnson, member-
ship chairman of the club, there are no discrimina-
tory clauses in the by-laws of the club. To qualify
for membership an individual must be sponsored
by two club members, endorsed by two directors

and then approved by the membership committee.

Midday Series Guest
To Reveal ESP Story.
At Noon Wednesday

4 A pioneer-researcher in the field of extrasensory perception"
(ESP), Dr. J . B. Rhine will reveal the story of his struggle with that
subject at noon Wednesday in the Student Union Ballroom when, as
Midday Series guest, he discusses “ESP: What Can We Make of It?"
He also will be available for comment at 3 p.m. in the SU lower

lounge.

‘Dr. Rhine, director of the Parapsychology Laboratory ‘at Duke
University, will trace the many stages of controversy emanating from

the study of ESP.

“What Can We Make of It?” the topic asks.

“At ﬁrst we make fun of it; then

we try to make sense of it; and,

ﬁnally, we try to make use of it.”

Author of a number of books
dealing with the mind, Dr. Rhine
began a study at Duke in devel-
oping reliable methods of testing
telepathy, clairvoyance and the
related claims of “Psi Ability” —
as these “psychoic” powers came
to be called.‘ Today the Parapsy-
cology Laboratory is recognized
as the international center for

ESP research.

Dr. Rhine’s» first book,

» “Extrasensory Perception,”
published in 1934, created a
furor of excited interest and
criticism. The book contained
evidence of ESP obtained in
strict compliance with scien-
tiﬁc standards, a first of its

Dr. Rhine replies,

kind in that ﬁeld. He followed that book with another, “Extra-'..;
sensory Perception After Sixty Years,” published in 1940.
A later book of his, “New Frontiers of the Mind,” caught the
public’s fancy and became a best-seller as well as a Bo'ok-of-the-
Month Club selection. Dr. Rhine is presently preparing another book,

“ESP and the Nature of Man.”

As a lecturer, Dr. Rhine has spoken ‘at iOxford, Cambridge, Lon-
don, Manchester, Glasgow, Utrecht, Copenhagen,.and Lund Univer-
sities abroad as well as colleges across‘ the United States. To his audi-

ences he has pointed out:

“‘Science has made, the most sensational advances in the
taming of the physical world, and still, the most important

aspect of life, the nature of man himself, the mystery of the

mind, remains a mystery.”

Chancellor Addresses Honorary

Chancellor Edward H.
Litchfield addressed 60 new
initiates and 51 guests at last
Wednesday evening’s Phi_ Eta
Sigma iwinter initiation ban-
quet in Stouffer’s Restaurant.

The‘ Chancellor spoke‘ after
Dean of Men William B. Crafts
welcomed and congratulated the
new members.

Apologizing for his slight
hoarseness, Litchﬁeld lauded the
freshmen as the “best class since
my time here, and according to

my older colleagues, the ‘ best -

ever.” Because of this, he said,
the quality of the faculty must
also improve and completed the
transition into his talk: “The
Changing Role of the Modern
University.”

With the hoarseness barely
noticeable, Litchﬁeld noted that
it is the duty of the Upper Ohio
Valley to recognize the need of
the University’s role and pio-
neer to_ set the example. '

He added: “Traditionally the
role has been to provide oppor-

tunity to learn, and, conduct re-

completed 60 credits at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh (which in-
cludes area campuses) and who

*has registered anoverall QPA of
2.75 or 3.0 for the previous term.

Thursday night that the list verb- ;

' alized previous interpretation -of

the SG -constitution and followed

‘basically the lines of Roberts’

Rules of Order.

Since there was neither a
quorum of the present senate nor
a “well-represented senate-elect,”
President Marty Landy cautioned
that attendance should be enforc-
ed next year, with two unexcused
absences requiring a resignation.
Vice-president Gussie Smith then
turned the senate into a Commit-
tee of the Whole because‘ 'of the
lack of quorum.

The by-laws interpret the 500
students, represented by two
senators, as full-time, under-
graduate students, with alloca-
tion based on the trimester with
the maximum enrollment the
year before.

‘Miriam Meyers suggested that

- two senators represent each school

no matter how-large the school is.

The second suggestion stipulated
that the president pro tem serve as
parliamentarian. Present president
pro tem Ben Cardin argued that a
‘fppolitically elected” president pro
tem could not objectively serve
as parliamentarians, but that the
latter oﬂice was deﬁnitely needed.

The qualiﬁcations for vice-presi-

‘The Pitt News’

Receives First
I Class Honors

4 The Pitt News has been award-
ed a First Class Honor Rating
for the fall trimester of this year

byfthe National Newspaper Criti-A

cal Service of the Associated
Collegiate Press.
The Service, which judges col-

. lege newspapers twice each year,

is located in the Graduate School
of Journalism at the University
of Minnesota. The" judging, how-
ever, is done by others outside

" the school.

According to Fred L.» Kildow,
“Critical Ser-
vice judges are professional news-
paper men and women and per-
sons with extensive backgrounds
in publications work. Every one
is a college graduate, with the
majority holding degrees from
schools of journalism.” -
MENCHER JUDGES

The Pitt News was judged by
Melvin Mencher, associate pro-
fessor-of journalism at the Co-
lumbia Graduate School of Jour-

nalism in New York.

. Out of a possible 3,700 points,
The Pitt News received 3,250,
receiving perfect scores in many
aspects of production and lay-
out, and also in features and
typography. S p o r t s received
extra points for superior work
in display and writing.
According to the printed ex-
planation of the scoring “First
Class honor rating is compar-
able to ‘Excellent,’ and First Class

4’ publications may be justly proud

of their achievement.”

The Critical Service judges ap-
proximately 400 college news-
papers throughout the United
States. ' f

and that no business can be con-

‘At Home-At Pitt’_
Postponed Until
Wed. After Easter

“The At Home-At Pitt” Program
featuring Dr, Ralph Buchsbaum
has been rescheduled for March
31. Dr. Buchsbaum, professor of
zoology, will talk on “Education
Around the World” in his home at
7:30 p.m. ' »

Dr. Buchsbaum spent ﬁve weeks

3 this year working with eight Rus-3

sians and one other American. The
team planned improved high
school science education in India.
This project was sponsored by
UNESCO.

Dr. Buchsbaum believes co-
operation could reduce the rival-
ry and overlapping in foreign

_ aid programs. He thinks this
was the ﬁrst time Americans
and Russians cooperated in an
aid program to another country.»

Neither the American nor the
Russians competed for Indian con-
verts to either capitalism or com-
munism, according to Dr. Buchs-
baum. “We didn’t propagandize
and they didn’t propagandize,” he
said.

Students interested in visiting
with Dr. Buchsbaum should sign
up in the YWCA ofﬁce, 518 SU,
ext. 325, by noon March 30. Trans-
portation will be aranged from the
SU. Students should specify
whether they will need or can pro-
vide a ride when they give their
name, address, and phone.

It’s all over. The only thing now will be
the eifect of fall—out and radiation. It was
an explosion to be remembered. It was in

the best tradition of Hirochima, Nagasaki,

and Los Alamos. By now you should have
some knowledge about to whom I am re-
ferring. The Beatles hit the shores of the
United States with as much impact and
-m_omentum and impetus as the Marines hit

Iwo Jima. The landing of these barbers’ de- V
lightsproved to be thebiggest spectacle of
its kind since Bob Hope’ brought Jane Mans-

ﬁeldto the Arctic to entertain the soldiers.
Sociologists invoked their powers and
formed a hundred new teams to study the
effects of the Beatles on the American scene.
Their ﬁndings will constitute a new encyclo-
pedia of fadism to be published in the near

"future. Suiﬁce it to say that the Beatles

caused more furor on the young-multitudes

Billboard Boosts Beatles

According to the ﬁgures released by Bill-
board‘ Magazine, the Beatles have the
number one best-selling record in the coun-
try, “I Wanna_Hold Your Hand.” Mind you,
I said ‘,‘I'wanna” not I’ want to, hold your
hand, but English professors aren’t asked to
write hit ‘songs and they shouldnit Worry
about such trivial things as records which
sell three million copies. ‘ ' , 4

The number two hit‘ record is “She Loves
You” by” the Beatles, which has only sold
two million’. This is a tune with a‘ lovely
message but is not the‘ kind of song with
which to serve as a good -morning alarm
clock message. And their “I Saw Her Stand-
ing There” is number ten and movinggup.
Oh yes, their album is naturally the number
one in the album parade. .

Those kind of credentials are not be be

sneezed at, coughed over, or get choked up
about, ‘but they do prove a good point.
Whenever a person or a group of persons in
any form of show business become fads or

‘institutions, the people behind these pheno-

mena know how to take advantage of the
situation.

Three" For The.Money

,When EdVSullivan, or Solomon, brought
the boys over for three appearances on his
program, the response was unbelievable.

devastating. Crowds, riots, cops and assort-
ed humans came out in droves and the only

What then is the meaning of all this? Has
the world changed any since the introduc-

Where will all this end? I _wish I knew.
Someone once said ‘that all fads die out

¢as a consequence of a Men’s Dorm

Council meeting, word circulated
that they had received money
from the Deanof Men’s Ofﬁce to
ﬁnance their activities.
(meaning the house in general)
angrily denied. Charles Springer,
counselor of ﬂoor 12, investigated
and called a house meeting to set
the record straight.

-To the sorrow. and amazement
of the Hawthorne residents at-
tending, Springer had to admit
that the rumor was true—with
clariﬁcation. As reported at the
MDC meeting, Hawthorne House
did receive money from the Dean
of ‘Men’s Oﬂice; but only $41 to
buy refreshments for the ﬁrst
three events of the trimester and,
as Springer said, to get the pro-
gram started.

Few except the MDC hierarchy
knew of the subsidy. In addition,
the money was granted beforethe
Best Unit Living Award was con-
ceived. According to the general
implications at the meeting, either
no one realized or cared about
Hawthorne’s “unfair advantage”
until now, when the time for the
living award presentation is near.

Hawthorne House is waiting for
a clear statement of its position

relating to the award. They hope _

to ﬁnd out at the next meeting of

Editorial: Autlmrs In Resilience
In an issue of the Sunday magazine section of The New York Times which appear-
ed, about a month ago, there was printed a short article complete with pictures concern-
ing the subject of “authors in residence.” This term is used_,to deﬁne those well-known
writers who have consented to take a position on the faculties of various colleges and
universities throughout the country in order to teach and encouragestudents to write.
_ ‘ Most of the “authors in residence” mentioned in the article were ﬁction writers
' although there were a few poets and historians. All were college graduates, yet. most had

never bothered or had never found the time to take advanced writing programs and

‘earn their masters or doctors degrees. They were too busy writing ‘novels, books of
poetry, biographies, and histories, and becoming famous doing it.

The English department here at the University has known about this type of

program for quite a while, yet has never been able to start one of its own. Dr. W.
George Crouch, chairman of the department,’ has admitted that the creative writing
program here is not what it should or could be. ‘
l ’ Dr. Montgomery Culver and Professor Edwin Peterson have to carrythe entire
load of the program almost entirelyby themselves, and although both do a commend-
able job, they are both so over loaded with work that it is diﬂicult for them to give
_ the individual attention so desperately needed to struggling writers-to-be. Dr. Culver,
for example, teaches not only the introductory course for writing majors but also the
. three advanced classes as well. Even if ‘his classes average only 20 students a piece -
an underestimation if anything — that still gives him 80 students to work with, quite
a large number for so tricky a subject. ,
Yet the University doesn’t appear willing to help the situation any. Dr. Crouch
. stated that he has brought up the subpect a number of times but nothing has ever been
done. The reason for this could be two-fold. Either authors don’t want to ,come to
‘colleges to teach because they feel it won’t give them time to write or else the Univer-
sity is adverse to hiring instructors who have not proven themselves academically, i.e.
by, acquiring their masters or ‘doctors degrees. Both Dr. Culver and Peterson have
proven, however, that authors can produce while teaching. Thus we are left withlthe
second reason, and if the University is so narrow-minded _to think that an established
‘author without a doctorate will not make a good teacher, then this institution will
’ never be able to set up an outstanding creative writing program.

 

Now that Senator Goldwater
is deﬁnitely in the Presidential
race and is committed to a strong
campaign for that office, I have
1 started to wonder what life in
these United States and’, the
world in general would be’ like

Never C)n Sunday

‘ By Pat Pollino

The question of whether or not to have organization meetings
on_.Sundays as approved University functions has been kicked
around about as much as a proverbial football at a placekicker’s

institute. Up till now, all kicks have been successfully blocked by
the ‘administration. The only apparent way to
dent the administrative defense has been to pass.

Differing from the conventionally-accepted
quarterback pass, the organization pass is actu-
ally a Statue of Liberty play. That is, the or—-
ganization feints a direct offensive attack, nixing;
it in favor of a deceptive maneuver with ‘hopes;
of bafﬁing the defense. ’ '

‘Before you become lost in the muddle
somewhere between the 40- and 50-yard
line, perhaps a clariﬁcation of the matter  ~ ,
in simple, “non-gridironese’? would be a ﬁtting half-time
skull-teaser. ‘ ' l

 

It seems that a number of organizations have approached

various members of the administration as to -the possibility of"

holding organization meetings on Sundays and, at the same time,
utilizing University facilities heretofore inactivated on_ the Sab-
bath. The administration refuses to recognizeorganizational activi-
ties on Sundays; hence, the organizations in point drop the idea,
or carry ‘through with the meetings despite the inaccessibility to

such University properties as the Student Union Office, for"

example.

' The reason for such a policy, according to a high-ranking ad-
ministrator, is not a religious one. The administrator noted that
organized activities (e.g., classes, faculty meetings, and committee
meetings) are taboo on Sundays at other institutions of higher

\

learning as well as our own. - .-

However, the administrator added, in the same breath,
that the University does not frown on recreational activities
on Sunday — as evidenced by a Winter Weekend concert held
on a Sunday this term. _ s

The administrator pointed to a need for one day a week for
personal affairs — a day of reﬂection, contemplation ,and relaxa-
tion. Should regular organization activities breach "seven days, this,
saidthe administrator, would be an indication that perhaps there
are too many activities to deal with at the University.

Succumbing to what appears to be the “real” reason for the
University’s‘ opposition to the Sunday meeting suggestion, the ad-
. ministrator hinted that there would be anexpendage of monies in-
volved in hiring help to keep an eye on University facilities opened
on Sundays by way of a policy way.

If one agrees to exempt religion from the argument, one
is ‘then faced with the question, “Is the University actually
doing this for my beneﬁt and for the beneﬁt of my fellow
students?” '

e Envisaging the problem in terms of practicality, one would
have to agree that the proposal is not worth the trouble it is
almost sure to promote. And if the University were to make ex-
ceptions in a few cases, it would then have to honor the requests
of others. The answer is all or nothing at all, and the University
has chosen to impose the latter. ‘

The University is right! Students do need a day for “reflection, V.
e .-contemplation and relaxation” .—- andia‘ day to get, caught up

Mike Johnson Bids to Become

By BOB SMIZIK

Panther wrestling coach Rex Peery can
walk down the steps to the lobby of Fitz-
gerald Field House with pride. If he looks
up he can see the images of 22 Pitt all-
Americas or NCAA champions. Nine of
them are Peery’s wrestlers. Peery"s not

' content with such an overwhelming majority and

hopes to put up his tenth national champion
this weekend. ' —

His candidate is Mike Johnson, a 20-year-old
junior from Lock Haven, Pa. Peery’s hopes for
Johnson have a sound basis. He took a second
in the NCAA 123-pound championship to Mike
Nissen, of Nebraska, last year. .

Peery’s desire to see Johnson among the
Gallery of Champions is nothing new. It prob-
ably started ﬁve years ago when Johnson was
just starting on his way to becoming Pennsyl-
vania’s greatest high school wrestler at Lock
Haven. Mike’s brother, Dave, was already at

so Panthers ’ Tenth National Champ

Michelosen Seeks
Nine New Starters

Saturday’s rain proved only a temporary setback to coach
John Michelosen’s plans for getting the Panther gridders in
shape for the 1964 season and Michelosen will have his team
back at work at the Stadium today for the ﬁfth day of spring
drills.

The big problems facing Michelosen is finding replace-
ments for nine of the 11 starters he lost from last season. The
biggest replacement job is on the line where all seven starters
are gone. . -

End and tackle are the biggest problem spots because
only two lettermen return at each of the postions; Bill How-

ley and Ron Verkleeren are the only letterrnen at end and
Jim Jones and Ron Linaburg areé
the only letter-winning tackles._

End.coach Ernie Hetferle has
Mitch Zalnasky and Phil Da- -
players who

   

 

Pitt then and in the process of winning three s“t_w liTit‘S3(: 
Eastern championships for Peery. It ﬁgured that Vigalﬁn wzilth ;

It was hoped that Mike would be the ﬁrst \ back up vex, ;
l
l

Panther to win three NCAA championships since
.Pee_ry’s son, Ed, ﬁnished the trick in 1957. But
Nissen put an end to that dream.

A lot of people believe that Johnson will win
this year. Peery is one of his biggest backers.
He doesn't let family ties — his other son,

V Hugh, also won three NCAA titles--stand in the

way of his praise for Johnson. “When you take
in every phase of wrestling,” Peery said, “Mike’s
as good as anyone we’ve ever had here, maybe
better.”

The Amateur Wrestling News has establish-
ed Johnson as the favorite for this year’s NCAA
title by placing him on its mid—season all-Amer-
vica team. Even Johnson, who despite his cocki-
ness on the. mat, has a tendency to downrate
himself, grudgingly admits that “I’ll be the
favorite.”

Johnson showed little more conﬁdence than
that when he was an overwhelming favorite to
win the Eastern title. “Bill Stuart, of Lehigh, has
me worried,” Johnson said before the tourna-
ment. “I know I beat him in a dual meet, but
he'll scout me at Easterns and give me a better
match.”

Stuart scouted Johnson well and came up
‘with what is perhaps the best strategy against
Johnson—run. The Lehigh wrestler was warned
for stalling in the ﬁrst period and called for it
in the second as Johnson scored a more impres-
sive win than he did in dual meet competition.

The competition will be much tougher at the
national championships. But Johnson won’t have
to worry about Nissen or the wrestler he beat
in the semi-ﬁnals last year, Mark McCracken.

Both have gl-aduatecr . out there to make a deﬁnite prediction,” he th ﬁ t t- - 471_815o .~
“Mccracken was probably the best wrestler said. But Johnson has proven he can beat the :.re;SH:;1;11ii 0:i::S1::Wb;:::£ed

MIKE JOHNSON
Seeks National Championship‘

Despite the toughness ‘of Nissen many feel .

that a bad call cost Johnson the championship
last year. Johnson led Nissen, 3-0, in an overtime

period when he appeared to put Nissen in a '

pinning position. But the referee did,not award»
J°hn50n any points for the maneuver. Nissen
later reversed Johnson and pinned him. The
ﬁrst time Johnson was ever pinned. V "V

Peery said after the match, “If Johnson got
the. points he deserved for putting Nissen in the
pinning position he could have let Nissen escape
later because he would have had a big enough
lead. But with a 3-0 lead he had to keep riding
him and it cost him.”

If football coach‘ Johnny Michelo-

sen thinks he has a problem by losing
nineof his 11 starters, he ought to be
_thankful he doesn’t have basketball
coach Bob Timmons’ situation. Tim-
mons losses seven seniors, including
all ﬁve starters.

He does have three players re-
turning who did see a lot of action
this year and around whom he expects to
build next year’s club. They are Larry
Szykowny, Bob Lovett and Daryl Ruby.
The first two are sophomores andI~Ruby a

- junior.

Szykowny,- after sitting outthis fresh-
man‘ year because of ineligibility, surprised
everyone this year except Timmons. “We
expected a lot from him,” said Timmons.

, “I’m sorry that he broke his arm just be-

fore the season opened or he might have
been starting. But he lost a month of prac-
tice and that hurt him,” he said.

Although he only averaged five points
a game, Szykowny seemed todscore points

in key situations, as he did against Drake

RUBY

in the NIT. His ten points against Drake
was his highest total of the year.

Timmons said, “He has good reﬂexes.
His passing and defense‘ are ﬁne for a
sophomore. At Bucknell and at Westmin-
ster he was a major re\ason we won the
game.” _ ,_

Lovett also had a good season for a
sophomore. He scored 26 points against
Dartmouth while ﬁlling in for injured Paul

_Krieger. He was the Panthers most accur-

 Timm0nsFaces Bigltebuildi

 
 

 

ate shooter within aiﬁfteen foot radius of
the basket.

“I expect Lovett to score more than ﬁve
points a game next season,” said Timmons.
“He will also have to belour leading re-
bounder. Most of the teams we play have
a center bigger than Bob’s 6-foot-6.”

Ruby has-"been playing behind Brian
Generalovich and Dave, Sauer for two
years.

The other forward position and the
other guard position are the most open pos-
itions on the team. Juniors Dave Blyshak,
and Brian Fisher, sophomore, Nick Gen-

eralovich and freshman Stan Falenski have

the best_chance _of starting at guard.
Juniors Bill McIntyre and Tom Roan-
tree and freshman Ray Pilarski and Roth
McNally will ﬁght for the corner spot.
Jim LaValley, 6-foot-7 freshman, should

back up Lovett, unless Timmons switches .

players around.

Falenski was the top freshman player
this season. His best game was 39 points
at West Virginia. Peterson said, “If these
players work hard during the summer, then
I think we’re going to be a lot better next
season than everybody thinks.”

Baseball Team

Four basketball players have
joined the baseball team. Accord,-
ing to coach Bobby Lewis, all five
should beneﬁt the team-

Two of the refugees from the
hardwood. court played on the
team last year. Dave Sauer pitch-
ed, compiling an earned run aver-
age of over six and a won-lo
record of 3-2. -,

‘‘I’m counting on Sauer this
year,” Lewis said. “He gave up a
lot of runs last year and still won.
I don’t think he’ll get that kind
of hitting support this year.”.

Tim Grgurich was Sauer’s bat-
tery mate last year. He collected.
three hits all season, batting under
.200.. '

Dave Blyshak, a pitcher, and
Larry Szykowny, an inﬁelder, _are
the other two” members of the
basketball team to join the squad.

search so that new knowledge
can be discovered and old im_-
parted.” He explained that this

resulted in the classical educa-
tion of providing well—trained
people to solve problems and cre-
ate means for solution. Under
such a" system, continued the
Chancellor, if disease broke out
the classical university turned out
people to do something about it.

“Such as system is no longer
adequate," he said. “The Univer-
sity has become a vehicle for so-
cial action. From the university
today is coming new ideas and
concepts producing a tremendous
amount of economic growth. MIT
or Harvard didn’t plan this, but
it happened because of the wealth
of people and resources in the
area."

The role of the University.
according to Litchﬁeld, is to
make “major changes in the
part of the city in which we
live and create a University
city of which there is no dupli-
cate in the modern world.”
Litchﬁeld stated that the Uni-
versity must create an economy
and bring industry, research
oriented, into Pittsburgh to pro-
vide. in addition to employment,
in “series of things with more
than economic signiﬁcance.”

“A large» University with fac-

in doing this “we can't be as
