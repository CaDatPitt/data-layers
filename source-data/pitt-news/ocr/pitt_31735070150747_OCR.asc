Colbert makes good on promise o speak at Pitt  

Danielle Fox
For The Pitt News

The crowd rose to its feet and erupt-
ed in cheers as a man who both sup-
ports democracy and mocks it en-
tered from stage right to a backdrop
of the colors of the American ﬂag.

“Stephen! Stephen! Stephen!”
the crowd, which sold out the ven-
ue, chanted as Pitt Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg introduced comedian
and “Colbert Report” host, Stephen
Colbert.

On the last day of classes of the
spring 2013 semester, Colbert ﬁ-
nally made good on his promise to
speak before Pitt students at Carn-
egie Mellon’s music hall. Colbert
initially planned to make his visit
in January, but had to reschedule
because of illness.

The visit from the “ruthless and
jubilant satirist,” as Nordenberg
described him, was a reward for
four students from Pitt’s Swanson
School of Engineering, who solved
a treasure map from the Colbert
“Super PAC Super Fun Pack” kit last
summer.

The students, Daniela Aizpi—
tarte, Justine Buchman, Daniel
Stough and Benjamin Zaczek,

solved the treasure map and located
the prize in former President Ron-
ald Reagan’s birthplace of Dixon,
Ill. The map contained clues that
led the team to a fake, hollow log
containing an email address to con-
tact Colbert and determine what
U.S. university he would award with
a visit.

The Pitt fun pack winners pre-
sented Colbert with gifts represent-
ing the University, one of which was
a custom football jersey detailed
with Colbert’s name and the num-
ber one. Upon receiving it, Col-
bert quickly took off his jacket and
donned the j ersey — an action that
was met with thunderous applause.

After the crowd quieted, Col-
bert thanked Pitt students for their
patience before moving on to read
from his book, “America Again: Re-
becoming the Greatness We Never
Weren’t.” I '

Colbert read chapters on the job
interview process, Wall Street, food
and drinking. He gave advice on
how to psych out other job candi-
dates with the phrase, “This inter-
view was my Make—A—Wish,” and
assured audience members, “You’re
not fat. You’re just extra free.”

While introducing the chapter,

“I am Drunk,” Colbert had a chance
to show off his quick wit when a
student shouted to him, “Come get

drunk with us tonight!” In perfect -

stride, Colbert responded, “I can’t
imagine why you weren’t the one to
solve the puzzle.”

After the reading, Colbert
opened the ﬂoor up for question-

ing. The ﬁrst question posed was, _

“How does being a faithful Catholic
affect Colbert’s politics and show?”
To which Colbert responded, “I use
it to inform what I will or will not
make jokes about. For instance, I
will not make jokes about the sac-
raments  it’s a bridge too far for
me. I’m more likely to make jokes
about how people use religion in a
political context than in my own
political speech.”

Other questions were more

_ lighthearted. ’

One audience member asked
Colbert, “What was it like to bejon
Stewart’s b*tch?” Colbert shot back,
“Ask your dad.”

The show came to a close when
Nordenberg presented Colbert
with a silver bell in the shape of a
panther, or, more truthfully, a lion.

Adderall an illegal study aid, causes potential adction

Brett Murphy
Staﬁ’ H/riter

It’s ﬁnals season, and the ﬁrst floor of‘
Hillman Library buzzes with distracted
college students. But among the social-
ites, a junior stares unblinkingly at his
computer monitor, hammering at the
keys.

His foot taps uncontrollably. His cou-
rageous pencil clings to life under the
constant gnawing of a clenched jaw. He’s
not hungry. He has cottonmouth. And a
headache might be creeping up.

But this junior, who asked not to be
named, isn’t thinking about what his
body is doing. He’s not thinking about
the fury of dopamine and norepineph—
rine neurotransmitters pumping into his
brain’s nerve endings —— only the words
cascading down the once—blank screen,
seemingly typing themselves.

About one hour ago, he took a 30-mil-
ligram Adderall pill. Later he’ll take
another one to ensure a doze-free all-
nighter. He bought both illegally from his
friend — ﬁve bucks each.

The most commonly prescribed atten-
tion deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder medi-
cation, Adderall is a psychostimulant that
contains amphetamine. Recently though,
college students across the country have

been abusing the drug, and some Pitt stu-
dents seem to have a craving for the ubiq-
uitous “study buddy.”

The New York Times ran a 5,0oo—word
exposé in February on just how pervasive
and potentially damaging ADHD medi-
cation abuse can be. It tells the story of
Richard Fee, a promising college student
athlete who hanged himself two weeks af-
ter his prescription ran out. At its highest,
his prescription was for 80 milligrams of
Adderall per day. .

Tevya Zukor, director of the Counsel-
ing Service Center at Pitt, said Fee’s case
is no isolated incident.

“I’ve seen it multiple times. Those who
abuse Adderall in high doses can become
psychotic,” Zukor explained. “I’ve had to
hospitalize students.” ' ‘

When prescribed correctly and moni-
tored by a physician, Adderall and its
sister drugs, such as Vyvanse and Ritalin,-
are meant to alleviate the academically
crippling symptoms of ADHD.

Impulsivity, inattention and hyperac-
tivity hallmark the condition, said Brooke
Molina, a professor of psychiatry at Pitt.

“Someone with ADHD has problems
sustaini-ng attention and completing
tasks that are not fun or novel or reward-
ing.”

“For children [that impulsivity] might
mean running into the street without

thinking, and adults might spend money
without considering or speak without
thinking,” she added. Tendencies toward
hyperactivity are more common in chil-
dren.

Procrastination, forgetfulness, disor-
ganization and constant irrelevant dis-
tractions burden college students suffer-
ing from the condition.

“When people come to college, they
leave the very structured setting at
home,” said Srihari Bangalore, an assis-
tant professor of psychiatry at Pitt. “And
here they struggle with new social and
academic stressors.”

Anthony Xenakis, a senior majoring
in industrial engineering, had to start
taking 40 milligrams in college because
“reading and comprehending just took
hours.” He said it would take three or four
journeys through a single paragraph be-
fore he absorbed any of the information.

Since being prescribed the drug, Xe-
nakis said he can make it through a two-
hour lecture without even checking his
phone. And studying for tests proves feas-
ier than it ever was in high school.

It’s Adderall’s tunneling focus that
makes it an attractive cramming tool for
those without a prescription. The toe-
tapping junior studying for midterms said
it “just makes sense to "do it for studying.”

“Honestly, Ishould probably be pre-

Celebrate

scribed,” he added. “Because it actu-
ally makes me wariitlto do the work — to
learn the materialf’ But instead of going
through the “hassle” of the increasingly
thorough assessments, he’d rather just
spend a few bucks every week at the phar-
macy with a prescription. A

Molina said t_h_ere’s an unfortunate
variance among institutions in how they
go about their assessment of a patient
to determine if heior she should receive
a prescription. Much of this discrepancy
derives from the fact that there is no test
to determine whether or not a patient has
ADHD. A V ’

“Some will give a very brief evaluation
and others will do a very thorough assess-
ment,” she explained.

“It’s a problem that we have busy prac-
titioners that don’t have enough time to

"be thorough, and that makes it easy to ob-

tain a prescription,” Molina said.

Xenakis said , that since his initial
screening four years ago, which took
about 30 minutes,.he hasn’t been reevalu-
ated. Every six months he sees his psychi-
atrist, who “pretty much just asks me how
I’m doing, then re’-ups my script.”

Clinic, where Bangalore directs the
ADHD clinic, students in search of help

BASEBALL

Casey Roche slugging at the bat for impressive Panthers

RJ Sepich
Sports Edizfor

Ernest Thayer famously wrote the poem
“Casey at the Bat” about a baseball player
striking out to end the game. But when the
Pitt baseball team’s Casey steps up to the bat,
the Panthers’ star hitter has no such problem.

Hitting third in the potent Pitt lineup,
junior outﬁelder Casey Roche has excelled
this season, posting an impressive .354
batting average, smacking eight home runs
and driving in 51 runs to help the Panthers
(29-10, 9-3 Big East) get off to a great start.
After sweeping conference rival Rutgers last
weekend, No. 25 Pitt now boasts a six—game
Big East winning streak and sits one game
behind league leaders South Florida at the top
of the standings.

While Roche’s consistent contributions
with the bat have been “an integral part”
of the Pitt offense all season, according to
head coach Joe Jordano, the junior outﬁelder
showed his true capability in one unbelievable
game earlier this month.

Rocheetchedhis nameintheschoolhistory
books on April 9 with one of the best offensive
performances in Pitt baseball history. In a
dominating 24-7 victory at Youngstown State,
the Downingtown, Pa., native went 5-for—7 at
the plate, tallying an incredible 10 runs batted
in, smacking a grand slam and achieving the

 

rare cycle — hitting a single, double, triple
and home run in the same game.

“I can’t remember ever doing anything like
that before, so thatwas pretty ﬁin,” Roche said
of hittingfor the cycle. “It was a pretty exciting
feeling. And 10 RBIs — that was a ﬁrst, too.”

Senior shortstop Evan Oswald described
Roche’s breakout aitemoon as “truly
incredible,” and he said the Panthers couldn’t
believe what they were witnessing.

“I’ve never seen something like that
before. I’ve seen a cycle, but to hit for a cycle
and 10 RBIs in a game, that’s pretty amazing,”
Oswald said. “Right after he hit the double to
secure "the cycle, everyone was going nuts in

the dugout. We were like, ‘wow, did that just
happen‘?”’

That game may go down as a once-
in—a-lifetime performance for Roche, but
impressive hitting performances are nothing
new to the athletic 6-foot, 175—pound

outﬁelder. He batted at least .440 in his ﬁnal ‘

three seasons at Downingtown P East High

School and has hit better than .320 in both of

his ﬁrst two seasons at Pitt. . . - ‘
But perhaps surprisingly, the ‘Panthers’

star offensive player also impressed Pitt-

coaches with his pitching skills in high school.

“We felt, without question, that Casey.
could be a two-way player, which he still is,’

but he’s played more of a signiﬁcant role
offensively as a ‘position player,” Coach

' Jordano said. “But converselyghe has pitched

some important games for us. We expected
him to be an impact guy,'and he has been for
the past three seasons.”

Roche ’recently.—?proved that he can still
contribute on the "mound in abig way. After
struggling in his "ﬁrst pitching appearance

this season against South Florida, allowing ‘

both batters he faced to reach base, Roche
performed well in a spot start to replace
injured starter Rhys Aldenhoven on April 21
against Rutgers, pitching seven innings and
conceding just three runs as ‘Pitt earned a
walk-off 6-3 victory. ~ 5

Despite his incredible start to the season
that has launched the Pit junior outﬁelder
into Big East Player of the Year contention,

Roche remains level—headed, attributing

much of his success to his teammates.
“Guys have been getting onbase in front

‘of me,’f Roche said when asked about why
V he’s been so successful in 2013, “I stick‘ to the

approach that they ciachesfgives us, and it’s

' been working out; It helps that everyone has

Pitt community walks in
solidarity with oston

Students gather to walk for Boston on Friday. Claire Deahl | Senior Staff Photographer

After ﬁve days of shock and sorrow, Pitt stu-
dents gathered at the Cathedral of Learning
on Friday to try and end the week as best they
could, walking in support of Boston residents
and the victims of the past week’s attacks.
In the shadow of a passing rainstorm, Pitt

' students walked ﬁve laps around the Cathe-

dral and then linked arms for a moment of
silence and prayer.

“It’s just a small thing,” freshman Kev-
in Duva said. “For what those people ran
through  it just makes me feel better.”

Duva, who is from the Philadelphia area,
said his friends in the Boston area were
thankfully uninjured by the attacks, though
many participants in the April 15 Boston
Marathon incurred injury at the ﬁnish line.

“One of my friends left a half hour before
it happened,” Duva said. “One of my high
school teachers was one of the photographers
at the ﬁnish line, but he left a little before it
happened too.”

Several Pitt students were affected by the
events in Boston and more than 100 students
and administrators came out in support, with
others joining in later laps’. 7

Student Government Board initially orga-
nized the “Final Five at Pitt” in coordination
with Boston College students who planned
to ﬁnish the ﬁve-mile stretch of the Boston
Marathon that police blocked off shortly
after the bombings.

But in light of more violence in Boston
early Friday morning and the citywide lock-
down that forced Boston College students
to take shelter, Pitt’s walk took on added
signiﬁcance.

“It’s pretty depressing when you watch
the news,” freshman Brando Barry said. “If
we can just get out here and do these ﬁve
laps, I’d rather have this reported —— some-
thing positive. The good in the world really
outweighs the bad.”

Boston College organizers postponed the

ﬁve—mile walk Wednesday “out of respect for
the city of Boston-and the Boston Police De-
partment,” according to the Facebook event.

The walk in Boston, originally scheduled
for Friday at 4 p.m., was replaced with a vigil.

But when Boston oﬂicials released a
shelter-in-place order Friday morning in
response to the shooting, the vigil, too, was
cancelled.

Like other Boston residents, Boston Col-
lege students stayed inside all day, leaving
only to pick up lunch from food services.

“So many of us have friends there who
are instructed to stay in their dorms or their
apartments,” said Board member Amelia
Brause. “So we’re walking for them.”

Schools across the Northeast joined Pitt
on Friday in walking for Boston’.

Danielle Cole and Michael Padulsky, the
Boston College studen"ts who started the
initiative, said they heard from students at
Bentley College, University of Notre Dame,
Johnson and Wales University, Emerson Col-
lege and Babson College.

“The unity and support we have been
shown from all around the country, espe-
cially from college students, is truly touching
and incredible,” Cole and Padulsky wrote in
an email. “It is truly an honor to know that
[Pitt] hosted [its] own walk in concordance
with our efforts.” ,

Only a few hours after Pitt’s walk, Bos-
ton authorities lifted the shelter-in—place
order, and a few hours after that, Dzhokhar
Tsarnaev, the last bombing suspect at large,
was captured. .

“It’s a sense of relief,” Duva said after
hearing the news. “It’s nice to see the people
in Boston are safe.”

In Boston news of the suspect’s capture
was received with adulation. According to
Boston.com, people poured into the streets
waving American ﬂags and celebrating.

“It’s nice to see the people in Boston are
safe now, and they have a reason to cele-
brate,” Duva said, “but we can’t forget people
died during these tragedies.” I

Pitt upsets Georgetown to
advance in Big East tournament

Dan Sostek A
For The Pitt News

When the Pitt women’s tennis team defeated
Georgetown on Thursday morning in the
ﬁrst round of the Big East tournament in
Florida, the victory was technically an up-
set, as the 10th-seeded Panthers beat the
seventh-seeded Hoyas.

However, no one on the roster was sur-
prised by the result.

There was some reason for concern be-
fore the tournament, as Pitt had lost four
straight matches heading into its season
ﬁnale April 10 against Carnegie Mellon. But
a 6-1 victory over the Tartans helped pro-
pel the team to Tampa Bay with a renewed
sense of conﬁdence. . -

“I think it was really important that the
girls played a good match heading into the
Big East tournament,” interim head coach
Michaela Kissell-Eddins said. “It deﬁnitely
carried over.”

Later that week, the Panthers received
their draw of the Hoyas in the ﬁrst round.
The team was not intimidated by its foe, a
team-that had defeated Pitt 5-2 in February
of this year.

“When we found out we were playing
Georgetown, we were actually really ex-
cited,” junior Kimmy Borza said. “We all
knew that we had the ﬁre to beat them.”

And beat the Hoyas they did.

The Panthers dominated the match,
winning by a score of 4-1. The Panthers
won every singles match, as Borza, Taylor

t Washington, Jocelyn Lu, Amanda Wick-
man, Molly Wickman and Karma Parbhu
all picked up victories.

The Hoyas did win two of the three dou-
bles matches — Pitt’s only win being from
the team of Borza and Parbhu —- which gave
Georgetown its only point of the matchup.

Kissell-Eddins was quick to give her op— ’

ponents credit.

“Eventhough the score was 4-1, it was
an incredibly close match,” she said. “Every
game was really close, and I was just proud

of the girls. [The match] showed how far the

team has come over the semester.”
The win marked Pitt’s second ﬁrst-round
victory in the Big East tournament in pro-
V gram history.

After advancing, the Panthers faced A

South Florida, the host of the tournament,
in the second round. _ .
The Panthers struggled in their Friday

match, losing 4-0 against the second-

seeded Bulls, who are also ranked 57th
in the most recent Intercollegiate Tennis
Association poll. Pitt didn’t win a single
match, and the loss sent the Panthers into
the consolation bracket, where they vied
against the Syracuse Orange for a chance
at ﬁfth place. a

The Panthers lost to ﬁfth—seeded Syra-

cuse on Saturday, again failing to pick up
a victory. The loss ended the Panthers’
season. ’

Despite the two losses, the team looked
at the tournament with a glass-half-full
mentality. Amanda Wickman was no ex-
ception. l _    ' 7  if C

“It was a really» cool experience.‘ We all
played the best tennis we’ve played all sea-
son,” said the sophomore, who ﬁnished
with a team-best 15-4 singles record.

Pitt now must shift its focus to switch-
ing conferences, moving from the Big East

to the Atlantic Coast Conference for. next‘

season. Widely considered among the top
tennis conferences in the nation, the ACC
held 10 teams ranked in the Intercollegiate

Tennis Associationgtop 75, including the No.

1-ranked North Carolina Tar Heels; _

‘ Borza, who will ‘ﬁnish her Pitt career
next year, understands that ‘there will be
an increased level ofucompetition.

“We, all know-it’s just about the best ten-
nis conference in the country,” she said.
“It’s going to be alot tougher, but we’re
ready to compete against some really good
teams.” ‘ V’ V g V

. Kissell-Eddins echoed her player’s sen-

 timents. . ‘

“It’s going to take a lot of hard work
_-— hard work by the girls, as well as the
coaches. Everyone is really excited‘. We’re
going to need our girls to do a lot of work
over the summer.” - « .

The team ﬁnished the season with a 10-

1"2 record in‘ interim coach Kissell-Eddins’ ‘

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Board reflects on its initiative progress during ﬁrst half of term

Mahita Gaj anan
Staﬁf H/riter

Since taking office in November, members of
Pitt’s Student Government Board have worked
to implement the group’s initiatives — three
projects Board members proposed during their
bids for candidacy.

While some have made signiﬁcant progress
or have even seen all of their projects through to
completion, others have the remainder of the
fall semesterto see their plans come to fruition.

Gordon Louderback

Board President Gordon Louderback com-
pleted his three initiatives within the ﬁrst few
weeks of his term. He had planned to create a
campus project submissionform, make the al-
locations process more transparent and select a
Fundraising and Advertising Committee chair.

With a form available on the SGB website
and Facebook page, Louderback achieved his
goal of allowing students to submit their ideas
for campus improvement.

“I don’t want the Board members to be the
only people who have their ideas heard,” Loud-
erback said.

Since starting the project, SGB has received

about seven project ideas. Louderback said one
project he planned to pursue was a suggestion
from a student calling for tours of residence
halls. Over the summer, Louderback plans to
make a video that gives a virtual tour of every
campus residence hallas aresource for students
looking to choose on-campus housing.

Louderback said that although the submis-
sion form is available, he is still exploring op-
tions in making the form more accessible to
students.

Louderback’s second project involved mak-
ing the allocations process more transparent.
To do this, he added columns to the weekly al-

locations minutes, detailing money distribution
for every organization that requested funding.

“When we prep for public meeting, it seems
to be a lot more concrete than it was before,”
Louderback said, noting that knowing these
details helps keep the process of allocating
money more consistent.

For his third project, Louderback placed
Erin Worbs as chairwoman of the newly formed
Fundraising and Advertising Committee. The
committee, created during the beginning of the
2013 Board’s term, is responsible for advertising
SGB events as well-as helping student organi-
zations come up with fundraising ideas and
advertise their events. Louderback proposed
the Fundraising and Advertising Committee
to replace SGB’s Public Relations Committee,
and the former was then voted in by the Board.

Louderback’s future goals include moving
to collect and organize a history of SGB over
the summer through the appointment of SGB
historian Bryce Custer and helping advance
projects that he worked on during his time on
the 2012 Board. Completed projects that had
carried over from his time on the Board include
implementingwireless Internet access in cam-
pus dormitories, which was completed earlier

1 this month and will be ofﬁcially implemented

by the fall semester, and the Panther Pitt foot-
ball cheering section oflicially established as a
student organization through the Traditions
Committee.

Amelia Brause

Fall semester will be a busy one for Board
member Amelia Brause. Brause campaigned on
expanding the Healthy U program and organiz-
ing a campuswide philanthropy week, both of
which will come to fruition in the fall.

Brause has organized aprogram to expand
Healthy U. Each month through the 2013-2014
academic year, the Healthy U initiative will
focus on one of the seven tenets ofwellness the
program supports, including physical, emo-
tional, intellectual, social, occupational, envi-
ronmental and spiritual wellness. The program
is set to start this fall with yoga on the Cathedral
Lawn to spotlight thehtenet of physical wellness.

“We worked it out timing-wise where each
one will be completed beforeﬁnals week [of
both thefall and spring semester],” Brause said.

The programwill also include a “countdown
to ﬁnals week” event, duringwhich volunteers
will offer stress-relieving activities to students,
Brause said. ' . -

Brause’s second event set for the fall is
Fundraising Week, to be held during the week
before Pitt’s Homecoming. Brause organized
the schedule for each day around a different
activity. According to Brause, the weeklong
program will include an activities fair to_ allow
different fundraising groups to increase mem-

‘ bership, a day that spotlights different cultural

organizations around campus and a food fair.

To raise money for a charity Pitt will choose
to support during Fundraising Week, Brause
said she wanted to organize pickup games
of sports, including soccer and basketball,
through which students could form teams and

pay a certain amount to play in a tournament.
Students would pay about $5, Brause said. On
the Thursday of Fundraisingweek, Brause said
she hopes to have every business on Forbes
Avenue donate a portion of the money brought
in for the day to the chosen charity.

Brause’s third initiative involved working
with the Student Organization Resource Center
to allow student organizations to advertise/in

one place online. The portal would show what.

SORC offers students and would allow organi-
zations to promote events more efﬁciently. It
would also allow organizers to provide quick
updates on daily events hosted by their organi-
zations. Brause said that she plans to pursue the
SORC project more in the fall, as she has been
focusing on her other initiatives this spring.

Sowmya Sanapala,

Board member Sowmya Sanapala’s three
initiatives involved advocating for Pitt to affili-
ate itself with the Workers Rights Consortium,
improving sexual health on campus and form-
inga multicultural committee of Pitt students.

Sanapala said she learned alot about work-
ing as a liaison between students and the Pitt
administration in her role as a Board member.
Sanapala is a member of Americans for In-
formed Democracy, the organization that is
leading the push for the University to afﬁliate
with the Worker Rights Consortium, an orga-
nization that monitors conditions at factories
that make university apparel. As both amember
of AID and of the Board, Sanapala has taken on

71.8

the job of talking to administration about what
she sees as the beneﬁts of afﬁliatingwith WRC.

“It’s really hard to tell the administration
that something has to change,” Sanapala said.
“It was really helpful for me to see where SGB
can step in and help.” ‘

Regarding her initiative to promote sexual
health on campus, especially in procuringfree
prophylactics for students, Sanapala succeeded
in setting up a procedure to allow student orga-
nizations to request condoms for their events
from Student Health Services. Though it doesn’t
ﬁilﬁll her initial goal of providing free prophy-
lactics for all students, -Sanapala said she was
thankful for the small victory.

“At least the administration is acknowledg-
ing that this exists by formalizing the process,”
Sanapala said. ‘“

Hernext step is to ﬁnd a way to make con-
doms available to students at an even cheaper
price than they are offered atthe Student Health
pharmacy. —

While planningfor her third initiative, Sana-
pala realized that creating a committee that
explored multicultural themes might not be a
priority every year. She decided to form a coun-
cil of student leaders as part of the Multicultural
Association instead of pursuing her original

proposal to create a Multicultural Committee ‘

within SGB. Sanapala hopes thatthe councilwill
bring the student leaders together to advocate
for their cultural groups.

“I see it as away to unify the cultural groups
so they can communicate and help each other,”
Sanapala said. ' —

focused on internal University matters. Dur-
ing the spring semester, Jabro worked toward
having students complete OMET surveys online
and making them public. Most of the surveys
were given online this semester. Next semester,
they will be ﬁilly paperless.

Last semester, the percentage of students
ﬁlling out OMET surveys dropped from the 75
percent average for paper surveys to just under
half for the electronic version.Jabro acknowl-
edged that the number of students who ﬁlled
out the story dropped last semester, but he said
that, according to statistics from other universi-
ties, the percentage will go up after a few years.

“It’s a transition period,”jabro said.

Jabro added that Pitt’s business school and
Graduate School of Public Health have made the
survey results public, but the Dietrich School
of Arts and Sciences has not.

His second initiative involved opening up
a dialogue with Sodexo about improving meal
plans. To do this, every other Fridayjabro and
Board member Mike Nites have been attend-

. ing Food Committee meetings, during which

Sodexo managers and students gather to talk
about what could be improved in the system.
Jabro said he has been working to come up

with tangible proof and statistics regarding

what changes studentsgwant. He found that
generally, students want more dining dollars
and many would like to pay in cash for dining
dollars in lieu of purchasing a full dining plan.
He will work to implement these changes in
the fall.

funding for service organizations through the
allocations process. To make this possible,

Jabro said, he has been looking through the
Allocations Code and strategizing about how
best to approach the goal.

Sarah Winston

Board member Sarah Winston has made
headway on her three initiatives: implement-
ing an online portal for students to make ap-
pointments for Student Health Services, setting
up a textbook swap and creating an Office of
Sustainability at Pitt.

Winston said Student Health Services
planned to make the scheduling portal avail-
able April 1, and she said that Student Health
Services has reported to her that students have
utilized the service and that the link works,
although she had not attempted to use the link
herself. As of press time, however, the live link
to the portal wasn’t located on the Student
Health Services web page for scheduling ap-
pointments and could notbe located elsewhere.

Winston said she hopes a textbook swap
will happen next spring, and as of now, she
is working closely with the Academic Affairs
Committee to learn more about the way the
campus book center operates.

Winston’s third initiative, to make a sustain-
ability advisory board as part of Student Affairs,
has turned into a different project. Under her

. new proposal, Winston hopes to bring together
all the environmental organizations on campus
to form an Office of Sustainability, allowing
all the groups to collaborate and talk about
environmental issues on campus.

This summer do something to boost

your resume and job prospects

"Eric Baldwin
Columnist

This summer, like past summers, many of my

_undergraduate peers will do work of some

sort or another at home, in Pittsburgh or in
some other city or town. However, many oth-
ers, especially upperclassmen, will remain in
Pittsburgh and —— like college students across
the country — desperately search for a job,
ﬁnd one that requires little to no skill and
work as hard as they can to make as much
money as they can.

Many of them do this to avoid having to
spend the summer at home under the con-
straints of living with their parents and the .
monotony of the at-home routine that is

.reminiscent of high school years. Others do

this to avoid working during the academic
year and still be able to ﬁnance their leisurely
activities, mostly consisting of debauchery
and degradation. However, I argue that the
summer months of our undergraduate years
should not be spent working some monoto-
nous low—paying job that has little beneﬁt for
our long-term life plans.

I argue that instead of working harder
only during the summer, working smarter
throughout the year proves far more reward-
ing and beneﬁcial. What I mean by working

smarter is planning out employment and
other sources of income, beginning early or
before arriving at college, and looking for or
molding positions so that they beneﬁt your
long-term career and life goals.

Look for campus jobs, research and aca-
demic positions for undergraduates, research
fellowships, laboratories and private compa-
nies that do whatever it is that you are inter-
ested in. If you can manage to get a job with
them early on and commit, whether formally
or informally, to sticking with them for more
than just one semester or one summer, they
will be far more likely to hire you and provide
better compensation. If you are working for a
research group, an academic department or
a private business, they are far more likely to
keep you on over the summer if you work con-

sistently throughout the academic year than ‘

if you demand summers off or ask to only
work during the summers.

Often my colleagues counter. my argu-
ment by claiming that their major work is so
intensive and difficult during the semester
that there is no time for quotidian trivialities
such as work. I counter this with: Work on
campus, work between classes during the day
when you otherwise would probably not be

Professors offer different formats for taking exams

Shruti Ravenkar
Staff Writer

As ﬁnals week begins, Pitt students can be
seen scattered throughout campus, hunch~
ing over their textbooks in preparation for
their dreaded exams. Finals week usually
evokes images of students frantically tak-
ing paper exams in a large lecture hall.

But professors at Pitt sometimes uti-
lize unconventional testing methods such
as online or oral exams. Some professors
even give students optional ﬁnals. With
such a broad variety of testing formats,
each comes with its own advantages and
disadvantages. -

The conventional testing method is to
take some type of written exam in a class-
room during ﬁnals week. Many profes-
sors, especially those who teach classes
in the natural sciences, choose to use this
format. 4

Laurel Roberts, a professor at Pitt, uses
this format for her human physiology
class. She said the only time that she didn’t
use this type of in-class test was during
the bomb threats in the spring semester of
last year, which re_sulted in many profes-
sors administering timed online exams.
Because of the technical difliculties that
could arise from other formats, such as

A online exams, it makes sense to her to use

this conventional in-class method.

“I like having students in the room with
me because sometimes I make errors on
my exams and it allows everyone an oppor-
tunity to get the same information at the
same time and ask questions, if need be,”
Roberts said. 7

Sam Donovan, a biology professor at
Pitt, uses paper tests for slightly different
reasons. He feels that large lecture courses
such as Foundations of Biology have limi-
tations when it comes to testing students.
He said that one—on-one meetings with
students would be a great way of gauging
knowledge. .

“It would be wonderful to sit with each
student individually and assess their un-
derstanding of the material by having a
conversation,” Donovan said. “I use an
oral-exam format for makeup tests and
it is relatively easy to tell which concepts
students really know and which they are
just familiar wit .”

Despite Donovan’s support for oral ex-
amination methods, he realizes the limi-
tations of this approach. “Unfortunately,
that kind of test just doesn’t scale to a large
course,” he said.

But some Pitt professors sometimes
don’t require students to take a ﬁnal at
all. Pitt professor Allan Zuckoff has an op-
tional ﬁnal for his Introduction to Psychol-
ogy and Introduction to Social Psychology

. classes.

Zuckoif said that he uses four in-class
exams in his courses that cover all of the
material in the course.

“Therefore, a student who has taken all

four exams has demonstrated his or her
level of mastery of the material, and if he
or she is satisﬁed with his or her perfor-
mance, then I ﬁndit appropriate for his or
her course grade to reﬂect the average of
those four exams,” he said in an email.

He said the ﬁnal exam is cumulative
and is a chance for students to demon-
strate increased mastery if they decide to
avail themselves of that opportunity. In his
classes, if a student takes the ﬁnal exam,
he drops the lowest exam grade when cal-
culating the course grade.

The optional ﬁnal also allows some lee-

way for students who miss one of the four
in-class exams. Zuckoff said that if stu-
dents miss an in-class exam, they have the
opportunity to replace the missing exam
by demonstrating their knowledge of the
entire course material.

Freshman Sara Zahorchak likes the
idea of some classes having optional ﬁnals.

“It’s nice to give students the option
of taking a ﬁnal that can only raise their
grade, and it also takes stress off the stu-
dents so that they can focus on other ﬁnals
that are mandatory,” she'said.

Ryan Teeter, a business professor at

Pitt, has used online exams in the past and K‘:

is considering it for this upcoming ﬁnals
week. He has administered four online ex-
ams for his Accounting Information Sys-
tems class and has given an online ﬁnal in
Intermediate Accounting.

Teeter feels that an online test allows

him a great deal of ﬂexibility with his N

classes.
“By moving the exams online, I have
additional time to lead classroom discus-

sions and other meaningful exercises,” he

Television this semester has included a
riveting slew of episodes, from the power-
ful ﬂapping of Daenerys’ dragons’ wings in
“Game of Thrones” to Peggy Olson taking
over the stereotypical “Don Draper” role in
“Mad Men.” '

“Game of Thrones”

With each revolution of the metal crank,

stabbing pain courses through Theon Grey-
1 l joy’s body, causing him to scream. His cap-
tor reveals little about his whereabouts,
leaving Greyjoy just as confused and anx-
ious for answers as the audience at the end
of the second episode of the third season of
HBO’s hit series “Game of Thrones.”

As most season ﬁnales do, last season’s
cliffhanger left viewers with questions. Will
Robb Stark ﬁnd continued success on the

‘ battleﬁeld? Will Daenerys Targaryen’s drag-
ons provide enough ﬁrepower to land her a
seat on the Iron Throne? Will the looming
army of White Walkers — or King Mance
Rayder’s wildlings —— make it past the wall
and into the heartland of Westeros?

So far, season three has given us lit-
tle solace, presenting the audience with
more characters and closely interwoven
plot lines rather than providing answers.
The war has largely taken a backseat, as
Khaleesi -—- the name the Dothraki gave to
Daenerys — attempts to buy her army and
Stark attempts to deal with the distractions
Greyjoy caused in the north and the dif-
ﬁculties of having a new wife. Lady Stark’s
bold move to send the King Slayer back to

Judicial Committee releases recording of hearing

Mahita Gajanan
Stryf Wrz'ter

A recording of the Student Government
Board Judicial Committee hearing that
adjudicated an infraction ﬁled by, Elec-
tions Chairman Aaron Gish againstBoard

President Gordon Louderback reveals the ».

evidence and witness testimony that led the
jury ofcornmittee members to ﬁnd Louder-
back in violation of the SGB constituti(_)'n..

The. committee convened with n‘1em— ; '
bers of SGB at 9:05 p.m".;'on April ‘4 to hold"
its ﬁrst hearing since the_} early 2000's.  I
results of the hearing, vjﬂinrwjhich the Board ‘

tried Louderback for interfering. with the
autonomy of the Elections Committee and
exerting undue inﬂuence over its members,
were released on April 8, followed by a ﬁ1ll
transcript of the proceedings on April 18.

 ‘Gishfﬁledfthe ,infracti,on7after,he met ‘

resistance from the'Board while trying to
implement changes to the Elections Code.
At the time, «Gish had proppsed eliminating
the megaslate" endorsement~system' of SGB
campaigning, which allows two slates —
groups of two to three students running for
Board positions -—— to endorse each other
and pool campaign resources.

In his proposed changes to the Elections
Code, Gish called for a more inclusive sys-
tem. Because he is concerned that the Board

is primarily comprised of Druids, members
of a secret society on Pitt’s campus, Gish ex-
pressed his worries to Board member and
Electionslcommittee liaison Amelia Brause.
Brause relayed Gish’s cornmentspto Louder-

back, himself a member;'ofthei'Druids, who
. later‘ suggestedito. Gish that such comments
‘indicated a bias against¥ja particular group

-— in this case, the secretlsociety "—' and the

A . majority of the Board, who are members,

, judicial Committee 7fChairman Joseph
Kazakh read aloud Gish’s ﬁled. infraction in
his openingremarks. Gish ﬁled, the infrac-
tion 'March_ 31, accusing Louderback of
“exerting «undue inﬂuence on the Elections
Committee” in violation of Article I, Sec-
tion V, of the SGB Constitution. Gish also
accused Louderback of interfering with the

‘ autonomy of his committee, thereby violat-
ring the SGB Code of Ethics, although Loud-I

erback was not found guilty of this offense
because, according to Kozak, adherence to

. the,SGB Code of Ethics is voluntary.

“It was clear that there was some tension
and discrepancy regarding the - proposed
changes,” Brause said in the recording.

Brause said Gish made comments alleg-
ing that members of the Forbes and Fifth
megaslate were part of the Druids when she
had a meeting with him to discuss the Elec-
tions Code in detail. She said his statement
made her uncomfortable because it did

not relate to the purpose of their meeting.
Brause ran for her seat on the Board as part
of the Forbes and Fifth megaslate and was
the only member of its constituents who is
not a member of the Druids.

Board member Thomas Jabro, who is
a member of the secret society, said in his
testimony that he believes Louderback has
a responsibility to make sure the Board
functions as an entity, and part of that re-
sponsibility is to make sure that its afﬁliates
harbor no bias.

Jabro said he thought that all Louder-
back said was that if Gish were to act in a bi-
ased manner, Louderback would be‘ forced
to take action. Jabro said he could not de-
termine whether that could be perceived as
a threat.

He also pointed out that Gish stressed
diversity in his proposed revisions, but ac-
cording to the official duties of the Elections
Chair, ensuring diversity on the Board is not
a key concern of the position.

Board member Dave Rosenthal, who is
not a member of the Druids, testiﬁed dur-
ing the hearing that he believed Louder-
back was within his rights to address any
perceived bias with Gish because Gish was
focusingon the majority of Louderback’s
Board. Though he was shocked that the en-
tire‘ Board was opposed to Gish’s proposed
revisions, Rosenthal said that as far as he

knew, Louderback had never confronted «.-

anyone in a hostile manner.

Among the evidence offered during the
hearing was a statement Louderback sent
to Kozak.

In the statement, Louderback wrote that

on March 28, Gish gave Louderback the op— _ 

tion to ﬁle an infraction against him after
the two talked about possible bias.

According to the statement, Louderback
did not proceed to ﬁle an infraction because
by the end of his conversation with Gish, he
concluded that Gish was demonstrating no
bias toward the Board.

The second piece of evidence was a
memorandum from 2012 Elections Chair-
woman Annie Brown. Brown submitted
evidence of text message correspondence
between Gish and herself to attest that Gish

was not acting out of bias against the Board. I

The text messages revealed that from
March 26 until March 27, Gish seriously
considered resigning from his position as
chairman of the Elections Committee. Ac-
cording to one message, Gish felt that re-
signing would be the only way to exit the
conflict with the Board with integrity.

Brown convinced Gish to meet with

MAYORAL ELECTION

Once-crowded mayoral race stabilizes at five candidates

Gideon Bradshaw
Senior Stajf .Wrz'ter

Of the eight candidates who started the race

to become Pittsburgh’s next mayor, ﬁve re-.

main.

Former Auditor General Jack Wagner;
state Rep.jake Wheatley, D—Al1egheny; City
Councilman Bill Peduto, and A.]. Richardson,
who indicated that he is a school bus monitor
on his nomination petition, have all entered
the race as Democratic candidates.Josh Wan-

der, an international security consultant,
remains the sole Republican nominee.

Pennsylvania Sen. James Ferlo, D-Law-
renceville, and Democrats City Council
President Darlene Harris and City Controller
Michael Lamb have withdrawn from the race.
All three have publicly endorsed Wagner’s
campaign.

Incumbent Mayor Luke Ravenstahl an-
nounced on March 1 that he would not seek

re—election. The announcement came after ,

the resignation of Pittsburgh’s former police
chief, who was later indicted for allegedly

misusing city accounts and government-
issued debit cards.

In addition to their plans for econom— "

ic growth in the city, the candidates have
stressed that they will work for transparency
in city government. Though most students
might not be in Pittsburgh during the upcom-
ing primary, which takes place May 21, those
registered to vote in the city as Democrats
will be able to vote through absentee ballot.
The general election is scheduled for Nov. 5.

general between 1994 and 2004, Wagner
served as a state senator from 2005 to 2012.
Wagner served inthe U.S. Marine Corps in-
fantry during thevietnam War.

During a debate'on Pitt’s campus hosted
by campus radio. station 92.1 WPTS and stu-
dent publication’ Pitt Political Review, Wag-
ner said he would end the issuing of govern-
ment credit cards and will not use city funds
to employ bodyguards, which Ravenstahl
occasionally did when he traveled.

Wagner also said at the same debate that
he supports a lawsuit that Ravenstahl’s ofﬁce
has ﬁled against UPMC, which questions the
hospital’s /nonproﬁt status. Wagner said he
wanted to tax “proﬁtable nonproﬁts” such
as UPMC, which he said function more like
private companies while avoiding paying

‘taxes because of their nonproﬁt status. He

added that he does not consider Pitt a “proﬁt-
able nonproﬁt.” During the debate in March,
Wagner also said that as mayor, hewould
lobby to secure higher wagesfor workers
in the region. ‘ “

Bill Peduto g , V. .

Peduto is currently in his third term as
councilman for District 8, the area.’ that in-
cludes North Oakland, Shadyside and~adja-
cent areas.

Peduto also said during the debate at Pitt
earlier this month that he wouldgnot use a
government-issued credit card.  '

Like Wagner, Peduto supports" Ravens-

‘tahl’s lawsuit challenging UPMC’s nonproﬁt -

status. During a debate in March, Peduto said
that Pittsburghers “have lost union organiza-
tions as a way of life.” He also said that he
wanted to hold nonproﬁts, which ‘serve as
the region’s largest employer, accountable
to their workers.
Jake Wheatley

Wheatley has served as a representative
for District 19 since 2002. He served in the
U.S. Marine Corps as a radio operator during
the1991 GulfWar. .

Like Wagner, Wheatley said at the debate
earlier this month that he would not hire
private bodyguards and that he would not use
city accounts to handle his expenses. If he
does need to pay for work-related expenses,
he would seek reimbursement.

Wheatley said in an interview that he
would not have ﬁled suit against UPMC be-
cause it would cost the city money even if
it is successﬁil. He said that he wanted to
see UPMC raise its wages for workers, but
litigation was probably not the best way to
do that. Instead, he would like to focus on
cooperation with UPMC in order to come
to an arrangement that would satisfy both
the city and the nonproﬁt. ,

“Whengyou go to war, nobody wins,”
Wheatley said.

He also said that he wants to focus on
expanding the city’s industries that have
been successful, including the ﬁnance and
hospitality industries.

What sports

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

I’ve come a pretty long way as a devoted
sports fan ever since my grandfather took
me to my ﬁrst Pitt football game in 1998.
Literally.

My obsession has taken me to South
Bend, Ind., to watch football; New York
City to watch basketball; Columbus, Ohio,
to watch hockey, and even London to watch
soccer. I’ve attended hundreds of events in
various sports in Pittsburgh and beyond.
But until recently, one simple, yet complex,
question has intrigued me.

Why do we love sports?

The life of a_passionate sports fan doesn’t
make much sense to those who don’t spend
their time watching and worrying about
athletics. But the reason sports continue to
draw millions of avid fans and viewers like
myself is rather simple: In a world ﬁlled with
debt, war, famine and many other signiﬁ-
cant issues, sports temporarily take us away
from our worries.

Sports give us hope.

Sports make us feel like we’re a part of
something special.

Sports provide us with something to look
forward to tomorrow, next weekend, next
month and next year.

And sports show us what the human
body is — and isn’t — capable of.

Like many sports fans, I have had my
emotions moved on numerous occasions
throughout my life.

I witnessed the incredible ﬁnal football
game at Pitt Stadium in 1999. I cried when
Dwyane Wade and Marquette ended my
childhood hopes of Pitt basketball winning a
national championship in 2003. I celebrated
as the Steelers won Super Bowl XL. I expe-
rienced pure joy watching Pitt pull off the
greatest upset in college football history by
beating No. 2 West Virginia 13-9 in 2007. I
lost my voice at Game 6 of the 2009 Stanley
Cup Finals. I felt chills as my high school’s
football team rushed out of the tunnel at

V Heinz Field in the WPIAL championship
game with my entire hometown of Saxon-g

burg, Pa., in attendance, just three weeks af-
ter a car accident killed the starting running
back’s cheerleader girlfriend. And Ijumped
up and down mindlessly when I watched in
person as my favorite soccer team, English

mean to me

club Aston Villa, scored a last—minute equal-
izer goal against powerhouse Chelsea at
Stamford Bridge stadium in London.

But during these past few years as a mem-
ber of The Pitt News’ sports section, I’ve had
to keep my emotions in check to maintain
my journalistic integrity when covering the
Panthers at football, basketball, baseball,
softball, wrestling and soccer games.

Trust me, it wasn’t easy when the football
team played one of its many down—to-the-
wire games, when the wrestling team upset
Virginia Tech with a walk—off pin or when
the Pitt basketball team -hit a buzzer—beater
to send a contest against Marquette to over-
time.

Sometimes I missed being a fan, hear-
ing the roar of the crowd and soaking in the
game-day atmosphere without the inter-
ference of a glass window. But I love cover-
ing sports, hearing press conferences and
telling readers some of the great stories of
success and failure that occur each and ev-
ery game even more than I love being in the
stands.

Regardless of what I do with the rest of
my life, whether I end up in the press box or
in the stands, sports will always be a huge
part of my life. And I’m more than OK with
that fact.

Sports, to put it simply, are truly wonder-
ful.

Finally, I have a lot of people to thank for
helping me become the person I am today.

Thanks to my grandfather for introduc-
ing me to Pitt sports. Thanks to my parents
and girlfriend for always supporting my
dream of working in sports. Thanks to my
friends for being there for me and letting me
bounce ideas off them. Thanks to Alex 01t-
manns for taking a chance and hiring me at
The Pitt News, thanks to Lauren Kirschman
for training me to be sports editor and
thanks to all of the editors, writers and pho-
tographers who made the sports section
something to be proud of every day this year.

I hope everyone enjoyed reading my ob-

jective game stories, features and columns
during the past three years as much as I en-
joyed writing them, but I would like my ﬁnal
words in this amazing college newspaper to
be very subjective.

Hail to Pitt. I

Nordenberg confessed that it appeared that
the panther had a mane. This gift was a refer-
ence to the silver turtle bell Stough received
from Colbert when he won the treasure hunt.
In addition to the panther—lion bell, the male
peregrine falcon living on top of the Cathedral
was renamed Stephen for the day.

As students ﬁled out the doors, freshman

Ryan Sperratore said of the event, “It was
great to meet him and see him as a person
and to hear what he has to say.”

A signing of Colbert’s book followed the
performance. The line wrapped around the
entire room, as students were eager to get a
chance to speak to the celebrity. Through ex-
changes, both students and Colbert expressed
positive feelings toward each other.

“I could not have had more fun. What a
great audience, clearly intelligent people,”
Colbert said. I

-WIT or WYTIAZ

How sports can prep

Torie Wytiaz
Senior Stqff Writer

When I ﬁlled out my application as a fresh-
man to become a sports writer for The Pitt
News, I did so thinking that it would be
a great "opportunity to work with fellow
sports enthusiasts while also, admittedly,
getting some pretty good seats at basket-
ball games. And I was right.

For four years, I have been able to share
my love of sports with the staff and the en-
tire Pitt community, and I have enjoyed the
experience. Like I anticipated, writing for
The Pitt News was a fun and creative way to
get involvedpon campus.

What I did not realize was the impact
my position would have on my future edu-
cational plans.

Part of the reason I joined the sports
staff was its complete contrast to my.ﬁeld
of study. As a pre-medical student, I ﬁgured
it would be nice to have an outlet through
which I could separate myself from science
for a bit and engage in sports and writing
— two things I ﬁnd relaxing and therapeu-
tic. I never thought that my experiences on
The Pitt News’ sports staff would serve as
preparation for a career in medicine. But in
every single medical school interview I had,
the physician interviewer brought up the
topic‘ of my work, enthusiastic to talk about
writing, sports or both. In the process, I
came to realize the power. of sports, and
how to use sports communication to unite
individuals from diverse backgrounds.

As I prepare to begin medical school
in the fall, I can honestly say that writing

sports stories for The Pitt News has been

one ofthe most meaningful experiences in
my time at Pitt and I realize that the lessons

-~~I have learned will be put to use throughout

my career as a physician.

_Here are ﬁve ways that sports writ-
ing has helped me prepare for life beyond
school: ' A

5. Communication evolves. Be ready

The Pitt News’ sports staff does an ex-
cellent job of keeping up with technologi-
cal advances. In my ﬁrst year, my stories
appeared in print and in the online edition.
As a sophomore, multimedia training was
mandatory and I learned to cut and edit

press conference videos. Since then, Twit-

ter allowed for live in-game updates for
students who maybe‘ slept in and didn’t
make it to the Oakland Zoo.

These changes in modes of communica-
tion are likely to continue. Rather than ig-
nore them, it’s important ‘to embrace them
for their 'capacity‘to reach wide audiences,
whether those he sports fans or patients.

4. Learning continues, even when
you "think you know it all.

I considered myself pretty well-in-
formed about sports before’ I joined The
Pitt News staff, perhaps even overconﬁdent
in my knowledge. That changed when I was
assigned my ﬁrst gymnasties piece.

April 22, 2018 1 The Pitt News \ v\A/\AN.piiinevvs.com

I attended a meet at the Fitzgerald Field
House and was completely out of my ele-
ment. I did not understand the scoring and
had trouble following the multiple events
occurring simultaneously with music in
the background. I had to ask questions and
research terminology, all as part of a hum-
bling experience.

As I pursue higher education in medi-
cal school, I hope that this recognition of
life~long learning allows me to accept that
there’s always an opportunity to know
more. '

3. Ask the right questions. Then listen
to the answers.

Reporting a sports story can be difficult.
Most people have access to the ﬁnal score
and they can watch the main highlights
on SportsCenter. It is the responsibility of
the sports writer to ﬁnd a deeper story and
communicate that to readers. To do this,
they must ask the right questions in an in-
terview setting and, more importantly, lis-
ten to the answers.

As a writer this is essential in getting
the captivating story, and as a physician

29

are all students for life after school

it’s vital in diagnosis and treatment. When
I was working on a volleyball proﬁle, I dis-
covered that when you give them a chance,
most people like to talk about themselves.
Let them. You might learn something valu-
able.

2. Expect the unexpected, both good,

and bad.

The past four years in Pitt sports have
been anything but boring.

I did not anticipate the football coach-

SUMMER édncms

Bands coming to Pittsburgh this summer create excitement

The Pitt News Staff

For music fans of all genres, Pittsburgh will
host a summer ﬁlled with concerts.
This summer, a variety of famous musi-

W cal acts will travel to local Pittsburgh venues.

Bands such as The Black Keys and Local Na-
tives, among others, are set to come to Pitts-
burgh and put on hopefully impressive shows.

The Black Keys with The Flaming Lips
April 30, 2013
Consol Energy Center, 8 p.m.

The Black Keys, composed of musicians
Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney, are com-
ing to Pittsburgh to headline a show alongside
The Flaming Lips, bringing two rock ‘n’ roll
heavyweights together.

Formed in Akron, Ohio, in 2001, The Black

'3 Keys came into the national spotlight with

their album Brothers, released in 2010. Look
forward to hits such as “Everlasting Light,”
“Gold on the Ceiling” and “Lonely Boy,” each
one transporting you to a smoky hole—in-the-
wall barbecue joint in the Deep South.

The Black Keys are known for their muddy
chords and head—thumping, raw blues sound.
Their songs ooze summer heat, concrete and
a beat that reverberates in the recesses of your
bones. This is a show you don’t want to miss.

Jeff the Brotherhood
May 24, 2013
Brillobox, 8 p.m.

Nashville rockers Jeff the Brotherhood
have a sound that takes listeners into a
cramped bedroom adorned with Ty Segall
and Ariel Pink posters and empty Bud Light
cans littered around the ﬂoor. The distortion-
pedal—loving two—piece released their EP Hyp-
notic Knights last year to critical acclaim.

Their appeal comes in part from their old-
school, brash, rock ‘n’ roll ethos, ﬁleled by
lyrics that are at once both rudimentary and
profound. Jeff the Brotherhood just makes
you want to have ﬁin.

It is ﬁtting then, that the southern duo is
bringing the party to Pittsburgh’s Brillobox on
May 24. The 21—and—up show is sure to inspire
the perfect summer attitude as illustrated in
their single “Sixpack”: “I wanna cool out / and
get wasted.”

Local Natives
June 10, 2013
Stage AE, 7 p.m.

There are arguably few better ways to

spend a summer night than surrounded by
delicately, but lovingly, performed music that
‘nestles against listeners with a soft, infectious
sound.

Indie—rock up-and—comer Local Natives is

   

scheduled to come to Stage AE onjune 10. The
band brings with it a sound that is modest,
yet reverberaﬁng. Their latest album, Hum-
mingbird, is decorated with the same type of
sounds of ethereal intimacy as their previous
album, Gorilla Manor.

While they’re not as boisterous as other
indie-rock acts —— especially the ones that
typically perform at Stage AE —— Local Natives
bring an undeniable sing—along vibe to their
live shows. Their heavy subject matter, often-
times focused on lovelom bouts of recovery or
recollection, isn’t the cheeriest, but it’s catchy,
nonetheless..

The crowd will pack closely together and
sway in unison as Local Natives delivers a
mix of their most well—known singles and
lesser-known tracks, all of which will be sure
to compliment a warm June night perfectly
with sounds that demonstrate a careﬁilly or-
chestrated and tightly organized immersive
feeling of contradictory pumped-up lethargy.

Songs such as “Breakers,” with its vocal
cooings that are secured between ﬂuttering
guitar strings and gentle, reassuring percus-

sion, are difﬁcult to not bob the head to. But i .

the lesser-known songs, such as “Ceilings” or
“Cards and Quarters” are where the band will
really shine as a live performance, as their soft
melodies surround the audience with irnmer-
sive and melodic harmonies.

A live Local Natives show may not be the
most high—octane experience, but it is un-
doubtedly rich in immeasurable mellow con-
tentedness that not many bands can deliver
while still keeping the audience engaged with
an enrapturing sound that ﬁlls music halls just
to the brim, never once pooling over in excess.

The Gaslight Anthem
June 12, 2013
Mr. Small’s Funhouse, 8 p.m.

On June 12, Mr. Small’s Funhouse hosts
The Gaslight Anthem, a group whose fame
has exploded over the last ﬁve years.

At a time where every new band has a
lengthy description of what exactly its genre
is, The Gaslight Anthem keeps it simple: It is a
Newjersey rock band — period. Their songs
reﬂect this, mixing imagery straight out of a
blue—co1lar jersey town with stories of ﬁery
youth and romance. Combine that with tight-
ly written, evocative music, and you get the
band'that’s been routinely selling out shows
across both the country and the world.

If the whole thing sounds a little bit
Springsteen—esque, that’s because it is. Front-
man Brian Fallon, who, true to form, worked
as a construction worker prior to breaking
through as a musician, grew up on music from

HEARING

dean of students and director of Student
Life, instead of resigning from his position.
It was following that meeting that Gish de-
cided to ﬁle the infraction.

“What this hearing is about is what I per-
ceived as an abuse of power on the part of
Gordon in his dealings with the Elections
Committee,” Gish said in the recording of
his opening statement. 1

Gish also maintained, in keeping with
his infraction complaint, that should the
jury vote in favor of his case, he did not
want any sentence to be carried out against
Louderback.

“The most I hope to gain out of this hear-
ing is the level of protection and respect af-
forded to the Elections Chair by the Consti-
tution and Code of Ethics while he or she
addresses problems with our government,”
Gish said.

I In his opening statement, Louderback
said he did not think Gish was biased. He
asked for more open communication and
noted that the Board’s theme for the year is
“Talk About It.”

“I wish any Board member would ap-
proach me if they feel like I’m doing some-
thing wrong,” Louderback said.

After the evidence and witness testi-
mony, the jury questioned Louderback and
Gish.

One jury member questioned both Loud-
erback and Gish about their comments con-

cerning the Druids.

Gish said he initially thought that Loud-
erback’s concern about bias centered on his
comments about the secret organization.
Louderback said he was concerned about
the potential for Gish’s bias —— not only
against the Druids, the Forbes and Fifth
slate or any individual involved with stu-
dent government, but any group or person
in general. After he talked with Gish about
this concern, Louderback concluded that
Gish was not biased, but he informed the
chairman that he intended to monitor the
situation to see if any bias arose.

It was as a result of this remark, Gish
said, that he felt threatened by Louderback.

“I felt like I was in an uncomfortable
position where I wasn’t going to be able to
address things that I felt needed to be ad-
dressed,” Gish said.

Gish said he felt that the Board was un-
willing to listen to what he had to say and
that it would not recognize what he felt was

‘important. At a second meeting, Gish said,

he asked the Board if he was the only person
who saw potential harm in the present elec-
tions system.

“There was a consensus that there was
not a single person in the room who felt
the same way I did,” Gish said, referring to
the problems he perceives with the current
Elections Code.

The Board acknowledged that the rules
of the Elections Code had to change, but ac-
cording to Rosenthal, the Board members
found Gish’s proposed revisions impracti-
cal. '

A jury member asked Louderback,  FROM PAGE 23

Brause, Rosenthal and Jabro if they ever
intended to remove Gish from his position I
as chairman of the Elections Committee. All I
four said no. I

One jury member asked Brause if she I
explained to Gish that his comments about I
Druids made her uncomfortable. Brause
said Gish told her he had information that
veriﬁed that some of the Board members
were Druids and that while she made it clear
in her body language that such comments
made her feel as though her integrity was
being questioned, she did not explicitly tell
this to Gish.

After the jury questioned Louderback
and Gish, the two received time for their
closing remarks.

Gish said he was aware that his position
was not above questioning but that making
him feel threatened was not an appropriate
way to address any problems with the Elec-
tions Committee.

“I believe I have shown members of the
jury what transpired on that Tuesday to the
best of my knowledge,” Gish said. “I’ve tried
to be as forthright and honest in all my an-
swers as I could be.”

Gish also offered an apology to Brause
for any personal offense she took from his
comments.

Louderback thanked the jury for hearing
what he had to say.

“I would never purposely do something
to jeopardize my involvement or the effect I
have on Student Government Board,” Loud-
erback said. I

said.

With his particular choice, Teeter does »

recognize some potential downfalls. He
recognizes that there is nothing to prevent
a student from “snapping the screen with a
cell phone” and the fact that it is “difficult
for students to show their work and get
partial credit for problems.”

He takes many safety precautions to I

minimize any cheating that may occur
on his exams. The primary step he takes
is randomizing the question and answer
choice orders. On top of this, students are
also not allowed to look back at previous
questions to change answers.

He realizes that this method may not
be appropriate for everyone and that many
students appreciate the ﬂexibility of taking
the exam at home or in a computer lab.

“I can also track the IP addresses of each

student to make sure they are not complet- .

ing the exam together,” Teeter said.

He also uses software such as Safe Exam
Browser, which prevents copying and
pasting, as well as taking screenshots of
the computer screen. Teeter said all these
measures help prevent collusion between
students.

Freshman Janna Brown does not ﬁnd
online exams appealing.

_“I prefer paper exams because I ﬁnd
tests that are on computers very distract-
ing,” she said. I

doing anything or work for a research group

‘ or your academic major’s department. Then

you can do work that not only enhances your
knowledge within your ﬁeld but also allows
you to do your own work during downtime.
Furthering my own argument, data sug-
gests that with an increasingly difficult and

‘ complex job market and augmenting compe-

Y

tition for spots in graduate programs, grades
and coursework alone will not be the key to
future success. What is critical is a compre-
hensive individual program that strengthens
one’s exposure in the ﬁeld, emphasizes the
value of networking and connections and

shows a certain degree of innovative imagina-
tion in a particular discipline.

Current data suggests that while those
who hold bachelor’s degrees are better off
than those who hold high school diplomas,
the contemporary situation is still dire: 18.2
percent of those with college degrees are
either unemployed and searching or un-
employed and no longer actively searching.
While 72.6 percent of bachelor’s degree hold-
ers possess a job, the data indicates that as of
recent years, far more graduates areworking
jobs that provide just the minimum wage. In

2012, about 280,000 graduates were work- '

ing in rninimum-wage positions as their ﬁrst
post-college job.

These numbers and facts do not serve to
frighten anyone. They serve to demonstrate

that more than ever, working not simply
harder but in a more intelligent, crafty and
innovative way is necessary during the,un—
dergraduate years to be competitive in a post-
college environment. ‘

If one does this consistently throughout
an undergraduate career by maintaining a job
during the school year, the summers won’t
be so hectic, the desperate job search after
ﬁnals will be eliminatedand summer can be
enjoyed working in a place that you’re famil-

iar with and that is beneﬁcial for your career. '

Plus, you won’t have to work as much, liber-
ating your time and allowing you to enjoy the
three summers of your undergraduate life
that you should be enjoying, not suffering
through while working odd jobs. I

go through comprehensive screening.

Even before patients get to see a pro-
fessional, they need to complete a packet
of rating scales, and a parent or partner
completes one about the patient.

“We ask general life questions, so
we see how you’re functioning and how
you’re relating with peers,” Bangalore
noted of the preliminary assessments.

After scanning for red ﬂags, such as
signs of depression, the clinic decides if
the applicant should see a clinician.

“It’s very easy to fake symptoms,”
Bangalore said of the candidates he’ tries
to weed out. “So I often suggest starting
therapy before medication. Those that
are seriously seeking help will stick with
it. Someone just looking for meds will
quit right there.”

Bangalore said the key is collaborative
information, seeing if the symptoms be-
gan early — well before age 7.

Despite the numerous precautions
that professionals take, people still beat
the system: Students without ADHD still
obtain prescriptions, and the rest can
purchase the pills secondhand. Students
still abuse the drug.

Bangalore, Zukor and Molina all
agreed that Fee’s violent psychosis is in-
deed a rare consequence of ADHD medi-.
cation abuse. Instances of exchanges
among friends —— students looking to

start and ﬁnish a paper or cram before a
big test — make up the majority of stu-
dents’ abuse of the “smart drug” on col-
lege campuses.

“It reminds me of a lot of perfor-
mance—enhancing drugs in sports,” said
Zukor of Adderall’s prevalence in the
hands of those who are not prescribed
the medication. “just like a competitive
athlete will choose that edge even when
they know it’s not in their best long—term
interest, a lot of students crave that edge
they can get, despite the legal and health
consequences,” he said.

The possible legal ramiﬁcations are
clear—cut. Adderall is a Schedule II stimu-

llant, and selling or possessing the drug

without a prescription is a felony. A
Schedule II drug is deﬁned by” a high po-
tential for abuse in its users that might
lead to severe psychological or physical
dependence. Other Schedule 11 drugs in-
clude cocaine, morphine and opium.

But Adderall’s ﬂuid, casual movement
around campuses simply doesn’t receive
that sort of attention. V

Molina said that the trade of Adderall
andsimilar stimulants is “under-policed
because law enforcement and campus se-
curity hasn’t caught up to the wave, and
when it happens, it’s going to catch a lot
of people by surprise.”

But for the studying junior at Hillman,
that message doesn’t resonate. “I don’t
think of it as a drug deal, but a friend
helping out a friend,” he said of one of the
numerous times he’s illegally obtained

ADI-‘ID medication, which he calls “the
wonder drug.”

“I think it’s so ingrained in college cul-
ture, and everyone knows it’s just some-
thing some people need.”

Zukor worries that this attitude can
have serious mental-health implications
for students.

“Adderall and other stimulant medi-
cation can have drastic interactions with
other meds, like antidepressants, reduc-
ing their effectiveness,” he said of un-
monitored pill-popping without concern .
“On the immediate side, there’s increased
nervousness, headaches, anxiety, dizzi-
ness and, as many psychotropic [mood-
altering] meds do, it can decrease sex
drive.”

He added that small, recreational use
can have lingering effects, including sleep
problems, unease and the jitters, not un-
like the feeling of caffeine overload. There
have even been cases of severe cardiac re-
sponses. -

Most who have used the drugs notice
these side effects, which often become

more intense during withdrawal, but the.

market for the medications persists.

“There’s money to be made for the
kids that have it,” Zukor said. “And they
don’t seem to fear getting caught.”

Lisa Nichols, a graduating senior who
asked to have her name changed, said she
made close to $400 her sophomore year
during ﬁnals week.

“I couldn’t believe how high the de-
mand was, and I was just selling them to

my close friends.”

She noticed that during ﬁnals and
midterms, her phone vibrates nonstop
with texts: “Can I get a 20 [milligram]?”

Leo Pencolt, a junior who also asked to
have his name changed, sells to an even
smaller group, including the Hillman toe-
tapper.

“I know it’s a felony, but I’m reallyjust
doing it for my friends,” he explained.
“It’s not like I’m doing it wholesale, like
some people I know of.”

“People need it,” he said.

It’s that “need” that concerns the med-
ical community. It ﬂirts with dependence
and addiction.

“Students are putting more pressure
on themselves to be academically suc-
cessful,” Zukor said of the culture sur-
rounding “study aids.”

Bangalore said that students can’t look
at stimulants such as ADHD medication
as “a quick ﬁx to help their academic suc-
cess, which does not come by doing well
on one exam.”

“They will feel increasingly that they
don’t have to work hard to be successful,
to do well,” Bangalore said.

Molina also fears that the mentality
will trickle into students’ adult lives. “If
a student becomes accustomed to accom-
plishing diﬁicult milestones by using the
crutch, how are they going to handle life
after college?” V

“What does it say about students and
our society that they ‘need’ performance-

“ enhancing drugs?” I

format. At 12:01 a.m. on May 26, 15 epi-
sodes will become available for streaming.

The fourth season picks up chronicling
the times and tribulations of the Bluth fam-
ily. “Arrested Development” will uphold its
authentic sheen, as creator Mitchell Hur-
witz is still in charge of telling the story of
the Bluth’s half—baked efforts to avoid pris-
on time, or worse — poverty._

At the end of season three as his fam-
ily is implicated in accounting and ﬁnance
fraud charges, Michael Bluth, played by

Jason Bateman, chooses to ﬂee to Mexico
with little more than half a million dollars
in cashier’s checks, his brother’s yacht and
his ever-awkward son, George Michael.

The series has seen George Michael,
played by Michael Cera, go through his fair
share of neurotic insecurity and tabooed
attraction to his cousin, Maeby. But as the
Bluths celebrate the discovery that the fam-
ily’s patriarch, George Michael Sr.,- built
mini mansions in Iraq for the CIA to use
for covert information gathering, thereby
annulling some of the charges brought
against him, it comes to light that Maeby’s
mother was adopted. L

But before the two youngsters can ap-
propriately relish the discovery that they
aren’t actually blood relatives, the recently
adopted Korean son of Lucille Bluth, the
family’s mother, ’ dramatically announces
that he has blown the lid off the family’s il-
licit monetary actions. This is all an act of
retribution, as he says that the Bluth fam-
ily stole his grandfather’s idea for a frozen-
banana stand.  

As Michael Sr. and George Michael head
to the Baja Peninsula and leave the rest of
the show’s characters to their own devices,
the end of season three leaves much of the
show’s mainstays in a state of ﬂux.

Season four, however, looks to change
that, with each episode focusing on one
character at a time, all in a simultaneous
time frame. The episodes are not necessari-
ly in chronological order because the events
of each episbde will technically occur at the
same time, though it can’t be determined if
that invalidates the traditional chronologi-
cal approach to watching episodes.

The promotional material available has

  an   

proved reticent, and it’s still somewhat dif-
ﬁcult to determine exactly what will happen
in the fourth season. The season has been
marketed as an after-the—fact rundown of
where the characters are now.

Despite being somewhat shrouded in
mystery, the fourth season of “Arrested De-
velopment” represents a monumental win
for its fan base, which was unsure of the se-
ries’ future for a long time.

Most promising is season four’s impor-
tant role in bridging the gap between the
television series and a full—length movie
that is also on the horizon.

Details are fuzzy on that future project,
but season four’s connecting role will make
it that much more beloved, especially after
depriving the world of Will Arnett and Da-
vid Cross’ signature characters —— Gob and
Tobias —— for so long.

“Mad Men”

The immaculately dressed and impos-
sibly masculine men of AMC’s award—win-
ning ’60s-era drama “Mad Men” returned
for their sixth season this summer.

Last season left off with some gruesome
surprises and the heartbreaking departure
of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce’s shining
lead copywriter, Peggy Olson. Meanwhile,
the newly married candidate for man of
the millennium, Don Draper, continues to
battle the demons viewers have been subtly
led to believe were gone.

.The sixth season’s cinematic two—hour
premiere is a jump cut of sorts, showing
the characters a few months from the last
season’s’ end. The office nowthas a’ new
.ﬂoor, Joan Harris is morbidly stoic after
the backroom deal that made her a partner,
and Roger Sterling is airing out his issues
with a therapist after receiving news of two
deaths in a short span of time.

It has been announced that the seventh
season of “Mad Men” will be its last, mak-
ing this current season the primer for what
surely will be a fantastic conclusion. And if
there are any cues audiences should take
from the latest episode, someone is going
to die. A

From Draper’s accidental evocation of
suicide in an advertising pitch and Roger
Sterling’s obsession with his own mortality,
viewers this season can be sure to expect
another shocking demise. I

much. But all of the coaches had goals like
mine: They wanted to win a College World

reason why I came here.”

Rosenthal’s third initiative involved creat-

Rosenthal was looking into chartering a bus to

The Boss, and the two have become friends
over the years, sharing the stage on several
occasions. For his part, Springsteen says he’s
a big fan of their music.

The knock on The Gaslight Anthem is that
it isn’t doing anything new. It’s just grasping
onto a bygone era of music and pumping out
albums in this vein. But Fallon and the gang
aren’t just hocking used goods. Every line
seems heartfelt and sometimes a little painful.
They’re the sort of lines that would sound trite
if they weren’t so obviously real.

Mr. Small’s Funhouse", 8 
It’s been a long, strange’ journey forjapan-
droids, the Vancouver two-piece band that
will come to Mr. Small’s Funhouse onjune 16.
After spending a couple years promoting

‘ singles and EPs around the U.S. and Canada,

both guitarist Brian King and drummer David
Prowse decided in 2008 that their dreams of
making it big with lyrics and raw energy were
going nowhere. They recorded Post—Nothing,

, their ﬁrst ﬁill-length album, that summer and

got ready to go their separate ways. Then,
as they were in the midst of breaking up the
band, Pitchfork users began raving about the
band’s single. '
From there, the band became a sensation

on the indie-rock circuit, eschewing complex .

riffs and shoe—gazing apathy for heartfelt,
beer-soaked- sing-alongs and a sound just
catchy enough to keep the whole thing rolling.

Last year, the band released Celebration
Rock, which builds off their ecstatic rise to
fame with songs that don’t even pretend to
be concerned with political posturing, heart-
break or ﬁrst—world ennui. Even when they
do hit on heavier topics, the tone is absolutely
joyous. In “The House that Heaven Built,” the
moving single off Celebration Rock, King says
to a beloved ex, “You’re not mine to die for
anymore, so I must live.”

That’s what makes ajapandroids show so
special. It’s a band that never expected to be
where they are playing to a crowd that throws
its cares away and seizes the moment. Those
are the makings of live music at its best. I

almost could not believe Pitt basketball’s

These unexpected moments of pain

1. Have pride in everything you do.

While I have enjoyed watching Pitt ath-
letes compete and relaying their stories to
the student population, it, has been anequal
pleasure observing the Pitt fans. a

Whether singing along to “Sweet Caro-
line” before the fourth quarter at Heinz
Field or jeering so _’that an opponent misses
their" free throw, Pitt students have an un-
paralleled. sense of pride in their univer-
sity’s athletics. I’m amazed when I see fans
tailgating in the frigid weather. I am blown
away by the noise level of the Oakland Zoo.
Once again, I must say that Pitt sports are
unpredictable, but I have seen that Pitt
pride is unwavering. V .

No matter what my career as a physician
brings, I plan fcop ‘maintain pride in my own
work because Pitt and its students have in-
stilled that value in me.

Writing for -The Pitt News’ sports section
was supposed to be a fun extra-curricular
activity with some deﬁnite perks. Look-
ing back on four years, I can recognize that
these expectations were met, but that the
position offered much more in terms of per-
sonal growth. The two main aspects of this
job, sports andcommunication, are things
that will always be a part of my life, both
professionally and recreationally. 1 .

I look forw_ard'.to using my experiences
at The Pitt News in the profession of ‘medi-
cine and am : gréiteﬁll for the_’op'portuni-

. ties that the paper and Pitt have"given me.

Thanks for everything.
