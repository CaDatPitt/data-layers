BY RALPH HAURWITZ
A soap box derby race, a greased
pole 'climb,. and a water-balloon,
throwing contest are some of the
events that will take place during

'the annual Engineers’ Week,

which begins Monday with a
parade, and concludes Friday with

‘the Shamrock Ball.

According to Gene Heckmann,

‘President of the Engineering

Student Cabinet, the program's
sponsor, “Engineers’ Week is not
just for Pitt's 2000-some engineers
(full-time, part-time, and gra-
duate)--it’s for everyone.”

Monday... Starting off the week's
festivities will be a parade, forming
up at noon in front of the Syria
Mosque on Bigelow Boulevard and
moving out at 1 pm. There will be
ﬂoats, special cars provided by
industries, Pitt unicyclers, engi-
neering marchers, and anyone else
who wants to _join.

According to Heckmann, “The
parade will go down Bigelow, down
5th Avenue, up Stadium, down
O’Hara, and end outside Benedum
Hall on O’Hara at about 2:30.
There will be a pep-rally at the
review stand at this point, and then

New Grading
Plan Referred W

to CASC

A proposal by the Psychology
Department to eliminate D‘: and
F's from the grading system was
referred back to CAS Council
(CASC) by the College of Arts and
Sciences faculty (FAS) in their

meeting Saturday.

After F AS defeated a proposal to
create a special commission to
study the grading system, they
voted overwhelmingly to send the
matter back to CASC which, along
with the Graduate Council [GC],

had previously rejected the A-B-C- -

no entry system. _

Student Government President
Mike Furick _r_eported Student
Government Board members were
split on the proposed grading
system. “We've also polled the
students." he said, “and the poll
was divided almost 50-50."

Furick said students were
concerned about the reaction of
graduate schools to the new

grading system.

Dr. Jeff Johnson of the Chemis-
try Department objected to the
proposed system saying “it would
erode excellence.”

CASC. chaired by CAS Dean
Robert Marshall, is expected to
study the proposal further and
report their position to the FAS.

Tuesday. The technical inspec-
tion for the soap box derby will be
from 9-11 am at the Benedum Hall
Plaza.

Defining the powers of Pitt
campus policemen is one of the

,major considerations of the new

study commission examining the
police department.

The precise limits of these
powers is open to legal question,
according to Jerry Bigley, the head
of the three-man commission and

Pitt Publishes Magazine

the first North American magazine

devoted entirely to the Soviet
Union.

Re-elected to the Mayor's office
after an unprecedented sweep of

In an interview with the Pitt

at one point gives them the power

said. “I'm going to get together

The study commission, which is
also composed of former campus
police chief Robert Fadzen, an

Stanley Gorski, a Pittsburgh police

also examining past supervisory

Fazden said while he was with

“I hate those movies."

When Kai-ie, a young Tuscarora
Indian, spoke of John Wayne
westerns, he did so with frighten-
ing intensity. “Those movies are
nowhere near the truth. They
make Indian children grow up
ashamed of what they are.”

Kai-ie was genuinely angered--
he “hated the stereotype.” The
noble savage cigar store ornament
has been replaced by a vocal
articulate Indian. They are now a
people with a purpose, a movement
and a message. Last week they
brought that message to Pitt.

Kai-ie arrived with 12. other
American Indians from various
tribes, who call themselves the
“White -Roots of Peace." The
group travels across the country
talking to people, hoping to shatter
stereotypes. At Pitt, they held a
social, conducted seminars,
showed movies and provided a rare
glimpse into the world of the
modern American Indian.

Like many young Indians, Kai-ie
is committed to the American
Indian Movement. The move-
ment’s main virtue, the one
responsible for the Wounded Knee
occupation, lies in the fact that the
movement “unites the American
Indians spiritually," he explained.

“Wounded Knee and the Bureau of"

Indian Affairs takeovers happened

because this country has not lived‘

up to its treaty agreements.”

Kai-ie warned, “Treaties are
supposed to supersede the consti-
tution--if our treaties are no good
then the Constitution can't give you
much protection either."

Kai-ie is a college drop out, like
many leaders in the. American
Indian Movement. “The univer-
sity,” he explained, “is a bubble.
They teach you about a lot of
theories but nothing about real
life.” He quit because he “wasn’t
learning anything.”

“Most journals before this have

sociological ways," said Schlacks.
“The Soviet Union journal will

Engineers ’ Week Begins;

Soapbox Derby Thursday

(Continued from Page 1)

“And from 10 am to noon,” said
Heckmann, “there will be the
Gimmicks Event, which includes an
egg-toss, a tug-of-war, a multi-
legged race, whatever that is, and a
greased pole climb.” Lard?
“No,” answered Heckmann,
“STP.”

Game Night will begin at 7 pm on
the 6th floor of Benedum, featuring
seven Las Vegas style casinos.

Wednesday. A service project,
sponsored by the different depart-
ments of engineering for the
Western Pennsylvania School for
Blind Children, will involve collec-
tion of money downtown and on
campus from 9-5.

“The different departments will
be given points depending on how
well they do in the service project,"
explained Heckmann. “They will
also be given points for their
performance in the other events of
the week, for example, the soap
box derby. ' .

“Points will be given for student
attendance, faculty attendance,
and spirit. At the end of
Engineers’ Week, the department
with the greatest number of total
points receives the Shamrock
Award, which has a lot of prestige
value.”

Another service project will be
sponsored by the civil engineering
department: sports films and beer
at 7:00 in Benedum Auditorium.
Admission is 75 cents.

Also at 7 pm will be an alumni
dinner at Webster Hall Hotel, with
cocktails at 6 pm. Speakers will
include Jim Meston, a stand-up
comedian, and Nick Timmesch,
who has written for The New York
Times, Time Magazine, and
Esquire.

Thursday. The Women’s Confe-
rence on Engineering,‘ sponsored
by the Society of Women Engi-
neers, will begin at 11:30 am in
Benedum Auditoriumand last the
rest of the day. According to
Heckmann, there are 54 under-
graduate women engineers at Pitt.

The soap box derby will be run
from noon to 3 pm on Lytton Street.

The finals for the service project
event--a water-balloon throwing
contest will be staged at 3 pm at the
Benedum Plaza. The cost is 50
cents.

From 8-10:30 pm, parents and
high school students admitted to

In the Indian culture, it is no
shame to quit school. Kai-ie
explained “Very few Indians make
it in the system. They try, but then
they realize that what’s going on
really isn't right.” The result is
“more and more are coming back
to the traditional ways.”

Calling the American “rat race”
society “screwed-up,” Kai-ie plans
to spend his days living with the
Indians as an Indian and plans to
work with his fellow Indians in
gaining “sovereignty for the Indian
nations." For his own good, John
Wayne had better not try to stop
him.

Is Rizzo

-   For
 Gun Control?

BY TOM SMITH

_ Is Frank Rizzo, Mayor of
Philadelphia, an advocate of gun
fcontrol?
,. Recently, the mayor has ordered a
“gun moratorium” in Philadelphia
in order to eliminate street-gang
(violence. According to police, 150
"street gangs are active in the city
, and 80 people have died as a result
of gang-warfare in the last two
= years.
. TA “gun moratorium” allows
I juveniles to drop off their weapons

at city ﬁrehouses without threat of
5 penalty. Rizzo ordered a similar
moratorium two years ago, which
resulted in the surrender of more
than 50 guns.
The arch-conservative mayor has
implemented a program designed
to decrease the number of guns on
city streets. It seeems Rizzo
;;realized gun-carrying citizens kill
‘people.
. ‘Americans only hear of gun-
__ control legislation when a promi-
.'nent citizen is murdered. At that
"time gun control is considered
essential todthe salvation of society.
A few months later gun
regulation becomes unconstitu-
j_ tional. This sudden change is
effected because of special interest
V lobbying groups. -

The Second Amendement to the
Constitution reads, “A well regu-
lated Militia, being necessary to
' the security of a free State, the
 . right of the people to keep and bear
_ Arms, shall not be infringed.”

a According to gun ‘control critics
the Constitution insures every
citizen the right to own weapons.
This includes hunters, collectors,
criminals, and the “average
citizen” who purchases a gun to
‘protect his home.

 However, the amendment is clear.
To accept the theory of gun
legislation critics, one must assume
 the word, “Militia" is synonomous
to gun collectors, hunters, crim-
inals and- “average citizens.”

Rizzo's solution to the lawlessness
1 of contemporary society is usually
. suggested by the most liberal of
liberals. That argument simply
states all guns should be sacrificed
.. to the state. Rizzo is saying this to
_ street gangs.

Statistics indicate most murders,
suicides, and thefts involve the use

' of cheap hand guns known as the

Saturday night special. This type
~ of gun has no function other than

maliciousness. No citizen should

be allowed to endanger the public
 welfare by owning such a gun.

The Philadelphia moratorium is a

;unique experiment. Though it is

not mandatory and directed only at
a certain segment of the popula-
tion, it is an initial step to control

A the number of guns in a so-called
civilized society.

Whether Rizzo realizes it or not,

he has recognized the need for a
form of gun control to decrease
criminal activity. And his solution
to the problem of lawlessness is a
radical-liberal suggestion which
would make Spiro Agnew turn in
his grave.

Maybe some day Americans will
realize it is not necessary to kill
each other to preserve the
intentions of the Constitution. And
maybe someday the Congress will
be able to respond to the needs of

1' society and reject the lobbies of
' special interest groups, which tell
us guns are essential to our way of
life.

Letters to the Editor

Fairy Tales

Dear Editor,
This is ideally an expose of
“operation secrecy" alledgedly

being carried on by the Student
Government Board. An expose of
this operation was possibly the
most simple investigation I have
ever conducted. The reason being
that the entire-“secret operation"
was exposed for me, and therefore,
I question the secrecy.

In the March 8th issue of The Pitt
News, “operations secrecy” was
invented by Tom Smith. First, a
few words about the article and its
credibility.

“Non-public executive Board
meetings"--there is no place in the
SG constitution or by-laws which
declares all infomal discussions
“executive" meetings. There are
times when the SGB members
would like to sit down and simply
bullshit about some matters with-
out the clutter of thoughts of often
knowledgeable, but nevertheless
unelected representatives. I am
quite sure that none of this talk
would even be attempted to be
withheld from any student. In
these meetings, no decisions are

‘made, no votes are taken, and no

opinions are solidiﬁed. Whether
these dis ussions are held in the
Wooden léeg, Furick’s dormitory
room, on the Cathedral lawn, or in
the Student Government office,
does not determine their ofﬁciality
or, for that matter, secrecy.

One of the problems of past
SGB's has been a lack of
interpersonal communication be-
tween the Board members. By our
informal get-togethers, we have
begun to break down this commun-
ication gap. But ._just like any
endeavor for progressive change,
some uninquisitive but mouthy
people have a bitch. No
suggestions, just complaints.

The trouble here is Smith’s
unfounded, undetailed bitches,
have been given far more voice and
ignorant credibility than they
deserve. This is due to the present
position of editorial editor-elect
held by Smith. Based upon his past
articles, his appointment only
creates a diminishment of the
credibility of this area of The Pitt
News.

I shall not elaborate on his
previous insensitive, unre-
searched, and ambiguous attacks.
Only to mention that such ﬁction,
since it does not accurately inform
the students, only hurts the
students by destroying ..our rela-
tions with the rest of the
University, which are essential for
productive negotiations. ,

“Student Government is making
decisions without student input."--
With this statement I shall include
his mention of “stagnation."
These statements I would take as a
personal blow. When the time
schedule issue arose, it was my
immediate decision for the SGB to
send correspondence requesting
the pressure of all Student
Government groups. It was the
Student Government Board that
realized there would be no power
without its committees. This fact
has not been forgotten.

The fact that the SGB members
aren’t spouting off three times a
week in this newpaper, doesn’t
indicate stagnation. As was
pointed out by myself and many
others, since our committees are so
essential, we are concentrating on
choosing’ good members for them.

— Consequently, the last few “stag-
nan_t” weeks have been spent on
this.

The Student Government office
is open alI'day, and as you can ask
anyone who has tried, we are
anxious to talk with any person at
any time. Unfortunately, Tom
Smith hasn't tried this approach
very often, he's afraid someone
might try to clear up a situation

wouldn‘t be able to
complain about. He may just get
an angle of solution that he
couldn’t criticize. Worse yet, he
might be asked for a few
suggestions! Once we did this and
it worked, so I suppose that blew an
entire article for him.

So with this I ask anyone to
witness my expose and do what
Smith and I have just done. ._Come

It should be clear by now that
leftist student groupslsuch as SDS

I am referring, of course, to their
pious ravings regarding “Jensen-

the Pitt News attacked this book as

with Adolf Hitler, and likened the
book itself to Mein Kampf.

Apparently the SDSers equate
reading a book with the automatic
acceptance ofits contents. They do
not give students credit for having"
enough intelligence to sort out
what is rational and justified from
what is not. Instead they feel they
must mother us by sorting out for
us what we will or will not be able
to read or learn about.

It seems to me that if SDS wants
really to achieve a victory against
Dr. Boughey and his “racist
cohorts," their time would be
better spent doing a little honest
scholarship instead of mouthing
rhetoric or reciting slogans. I for
one am sick and tired of having
attempts made to spoonfeed me my
knowledge. And I feel confident
that most Pitt students, regardless
of their particular political lean-
ings, are equally opposed to the
intellectual regimentation which
these groups and others like them
seem so eager tofoistupon us.

UAR

Dear Editor:

Upon reading the article
“Course Evaluation--Possibility
not Probability" in the March 1
issue-of the Pitt News, I felt it
necessary to write this letter.

First, I agree ‘with many of the '

points raised by Mr. Smith.. The
Student Government Board must
act quickly to get a new review
system underway. The demise of
the UAR was totally the fault of
Student Government.

The idea of organizing a
committee, possibly under the
Provost’s office, is good because of
the advice and direction the
administration could give the
committee.

The piece of advice in Mr.
Smith's article I find objectionable
is the following: “The new
committee must assume the
existing format as approved by the
Center for the Improvement of
Teaching is incapable of serving
the interests of the students,
faculty and the administration.
Further debate of this point is
useless."

The new committee [if one is
indeed going to be formed] should
and must take a hard look at the
evaluation system used by the
UAR. This system was the result of
exhaustive work by students, as
well as the administration. The
UAR struggled for three years,
trying different ways of reviewing
courses. The creation of the Center
was good for all involved.

The Center's director, Dr.
Grace Lazovik, brought with her
many years of research in the ﬁeld
of psychological measurement.

...And More Letters totheEditor  

(Continued from Page 4)

And the students (former co-edi-
tors Rudy Potenzone and Kathy
Stackhouse, with the invaluable
advice of faculty-advisor, Dr. John
Townsend) brought the questions
that students wanted answers to
about courses and teachers.
Through a co-operative effort a
questionnaire was designed and
measures (norms in the form of
deciles) were developed. The
result was a very accurate and
reliable instrument to elicit course
and teacher information. Coupled
with the systematic techniques of
processing this information and
presenting it to the university-at-
large, developed by the UAR, Pitt
had an official means of evaluating
teaching.

But, as Mr. Smith stated, “in
essence, the» UAR is dead." So,
when a group of interested people
try to revive the UAR, I hope they
will look at what has been done.
Five years of work in the area of
course review would be a terrible
thing to waste. »

Discrimination

Dear Editor:

We have noticed that. numerous
students (and the organizations
they represent) have charged the

’University and most established

places of business with sex and

race discrimination. Admittedly
there may be some places where
actual discrimination does occur;
however, we feel in the majority of
cases such charges are not only
preposterous, ridiculous, and un-
sound, but inconsistent with
humanitarian principles (i.e., that
all humans were created equal).

We believe in the Constitution of
the United States and we also find
racism and sexism disgusting. But
what we find most disgusting is to
hear arguments like “There are not
women as chancellors of the
University! There are not enough
black people working at Acme Co.,
Inc!”.

But have the noble, ‘humanitar-
ian’ creatures who scream such
statements ever considered why?
Perhaps a woman never applied for
the position. Perhaps not enough
blacks applied at Acme Co. Seeing
that all humans have been born
equal, should they not be judged
equally also? And on these
grounds we feel the best qualiﬁed
should be chosen for the _job. If he
is black, he is black. If she be a
woman and she is best capable of
handling the job, by all means hire
her. And if this means that white
Anglo-Saxon Protestant males con-
stitute 90% of a company’s work
force, be it 90%, provided they are
best qualified. ‘

Not too long ago a local news
show reported that a person who

, was rejected from a law school

decided to go to court. The charge:
discrimination! We do not know
the outcome of the decision;
however, he claimed he was
rejected despite the facts his QPA,
board scores, and all-around record
was superior to many of the women
and blacks that had been accepted.
Yes, he was a white Anglo-Saxon
Protestant. But the school had to
accept their “quota” of minority
groups. The result was his
rejection, despite his record of
achievement. We ask you,
minority group fanatics, who is the
victim of discrimination?

It would seem that John
Lennon’s song, “Woman is the
Nigger of the World,“ could

perhaps be better phrased as
“White Man is the Nigger of the
World."

Censorship

Dear Editor: K.-

The SDS desire to eradicate the
Biology 138 text Ecosystem and
Man raises some disturbing ques-
tions. Forced sterilization is wrong
but so is suppression of any idea,
no matter how loathsome. How
different is the SDS in their desire
to repress “disagreeable ideas”
from the Nazi book burnings? Does
the SDS think the average student

 

 

A  

is so dumb that he would believe in
ideas if they are so wrong? Is the
SDS truly committed to human
freedom or just for freedom for
their ideas? From actions like this
it seems that the SDS is little more
than a bunch of hypocritical
intellectual racists.

Women's Sports

Dear Editor:

I have noticed from reading
recent issues of the Pitt News that
the coverage you give to women’s
athletics is very meager compared
to that you give to men’s athletics.
In the most recent issue, for
example, I found no coverage of
women's athletics in four sports
pages. ,

I think this imbalance, has the
unfortunate effect of ‘ reinforcing

ixazif

  
  
    
   
  

_the stereotyping of men as”
“participants” and women as 5‘
“spectators.” In sports, as in
other areas, achievement by »
women seems to receive less"
encouragement and acclaim than a
comparable achievement by men.‘ 
I realize that you are somewhat I‘
faced with the necessity. of covering
those sports which already have the ,
most popularity, and men's sports , ._
do have the edge. Therefore equal 9
coverage may be an ideal that is not ‘ ‘i
totally realistic. 3
But a newspaper could provide a_' ‘
valuable service by moving in the’
direction of more equality. I
Sincerely,

A Under Project Afghanistan, 10
-students from Pitt go to Afghan-
_istan for several months, while 10
students from Afghanistan visit
The only requirements for
the program is taking a seminar on
__Afghanistan offered in the fall.

Ten students are selected by a
panel of faculty and students from
those taking the ‘seminar.

Candidates for the exchange are
then selected through an interview,
with a preference for sophomores
and juniors, according to O’Ban—
non. A

Sessler, who went to Afghanis-
tan as part of the project, said, “It
was fantastic. Completely different
from here. I really became
involved and the family I stayed
with became like my own. ‘ .

“I lived with a family that
couldn't speak any English and I
was treated like a family member.
I wasn't a tourist--I was part of the
society."

O'Bannon said this is the third
year of the program and the first
year a two-way exchange brought
l0 Afghanistan students to Pitt.

They will participate ‘in the
Afghanistan Day events and will be
returning to Afghanistan this week

after completing their stay here.
Project Afghanistan is funded by
the US Department of State and
grants from Pitt's College of Arts
and Science.

Afghanistan Days. begins today
at 7 pm in the Student Union
Ballroom with a showing of The
Horseman. starring Omar Sharif--a
film about the players of buzkashi,
Afghanistan’s national sport.

On Tuesday the program in-
cludes slides with a commentary by
O'Bannon, and exhibits of the
culture. A fashion show of
Afghanistan national dress by the
Afghanistan exchange students,
and a rendition of the ‘Atan'
Afghanistan's national dance, will
follow. The program will end with
two short films, one of them made
by Pitt students who traveled to
Afghanistan as part of the Project.

Plousibiliiy of FM Bond

BY BRIAN DUNN

Pitt's campus radio station,
WPGH, was granted funds at the
Wednesday Student Government

‘C Board (SGB) meeting to explore the

possibility of becoming an FM
station.

The SGB approved a $150 budget
modification WPGH will use for a
frequency search. A frequency
search is a test conducted by the
Federal Communications Commis-
sion [FCC] to find a locally unused
frequency level. ’If such a level is
found, WPGH may use it.

General Manager of WPGH, Al
Matecko, is confident the station
will be given FM rights; He told
the Board the change from AM
equipment will cost “about
$8,000."

“It should be going by Septem-
ber or January," he added.

In managing change in the ,
dynamic financial services field. . .

Like CITIBANK all-
CITICORP Subsidiaries provide the
“velocity of experience” MBA’s want...

In an environment that brings
talent to thetop, fast.

The growth of our Subsidiary companies has been based on
aggressively searching out and analyzing the financial service needs
of individual consumer and corpora
expertly providing them.

» (A few quick facts: Citicorp is the most profitable financial services
organization of its kind in the world. From just three U.-S. locations
in 1969, Citicorp today, mostly through our non-banking subsidiaries,
serves 25 states via almost 200 offices. These subsidiaries also
complement Citibank's global presence in more than 90 countries.)

That's why we suggest you consider the advantages of building
your career by helping us'to expand our leadership and our growth.

(A few more quick facts: Citicorp is considered one of the top
companies in the area of “executive development." We‘ve eliminated
the long-gray-whiskers aspects of financial services. Attaining the
level of V-P while in your early 30's won't make you exceptional.)

Because we have this group of closely related subsidiaries with
similar management philosophies, directed by highly skilled
professional managers, we are able to offer you a variety of challenges
and opportunities—intel|ectually, professionally and geographically.

By maintaining our 15% growth rate, we'll double in size in
5 years. There'fore we're concerned with filling key management
positions which will be open in 1980 now.

A talk could be well worth while. Please direct your inquiry to

WPGH, which receives about
$12,000 a year in allocations funds,
currently can be picked up only in
the Towers "and the Quad. If it
becomes an FM station, its range
could be up .to 10 miles, said
Matecko.

Bruce Keeler, the only SGB
member voting against the modi-
fication request, said, “I don't feel
that their broadcasting on AM is a
quality job. What a student hears
is not worthwhile. Until they start
proving themselves on AM, they
shouldn't be allowed to go FM."

Board member Paul Hertneky
replied, “I feel that their going FM
will increase the quality because
they'll have more listeners and will

reach commuters and . residents
alike."
Just before the vote, SGB

President Mike Furick said, “I
think as long as we’re going to
pump $12,000 a year into this

. thing, we might as well give them

the extra $8,000 for one year.”

However, the $8,000 request will
not be made unless the frequency
Search is successful.

In other business, the Board
approved new by-laws for the
Committee on Student Organiza-
tions (CSO). In the past few weeks.
the SGB had expressed uncertainty
about overlapping purposes of
groups applying for recognition
and of other groups already
recognized. Keeler had been
abstaining from recognition votes
pending‘ the approval of the new
by-laws. '

Article III, Section B of the new
by-laws states, “A prospective new
student organization shall not
duplicate the area of interest or
endanger the ‘support of other
recognized organizations.”

Section C says, “A prospective
new student organization shall not
duplicate the goals of an existing
recognized organization."

In addition, the new by-laws
provide for a “partial recognition"
status, which a new group may
hold for up to two academic terms.
Groups with partial recognition
may not apply for allocations funds
or office headqiiarters space.

However, they may apply “for
funds to be used for membership
drives and office supplies not in
excess of $100.”

For partial recognition, a group
must have “at least 10 active
members." For full recognition, a
group must have “at least
25 members."

The Board also decided - to
present an opinion on the proposed

.A-B-C-no-entry grading scale at

the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
meeting Saturday. Furick said he
will have to talk to faculty and
student leaders before deciding
what that opinion will be.

Larry Chaban, a student at the
SGB .meeting, supported the
proposed system. “I feel the
A-B-C-no-entry idea is one of the
first steps toward freeing the
academic atmosphere in the
University because it is often the
threat of failure that causes the
failure,” he said.

Furick disagreed. “-I don't think
it's right to jeopardize our quality
of education by making a 2.0 the
minimum you can get...We don.’t

A-B-C-no-entry system goes into
effect, Furick and Keeler felt.

become serious shortages as well
and this runaway economy is going
to be a big problem.

There are many other problems
facing the nation that are related to
the economy. If you have a
recession or shortages you get a
domino effect. so I see most of our
domestic "problems as stemming
from the economy.

 Do you agree with the Congres-
.C_::t)nal and Federal approaches to

the problems of the economy?

Flahcrt_v: I think there hasibeen
a failure both by Congress and the
Federal government in this area.
They get to work much too late.
they wait until the thing is in the
crisis stage and then they react
improperly.

The President, because of the
multiple problems of Watergate, is
so defensive that he is out of touch
with the people. he isn't able to
show the leadership we need.
Congress doesn't have the leaders
either so there is a vacuum and it
has gotten out of control down
fggre. _

How would «you size up
ScIiweiker’s performance in this
area? ‘

Flaherty: Basically he also has
not shown theleadership necessary
to grapple with the problems. He
also does too little too late.

Do you feel there has been an
erosion of Congressional power to
deal with vital issues?

Flaherty: Of course there has
been, and they know it. Congress
doesn't have the leaders. They
don't have mayors down there who

Cwe had to work with a $120

million budget and who have had to
go to the people for that money.
They don't initiate nearly enough
legislation. Too much legislation is
initiated by the President. or the
Federal bureaucracy. Congress

when I testified against the
increase.
I took over a city that was

bankrupt and turned it around.
Without raising taxes I've im-
proved the government. but they
have doubled taxes and spending.
ldon't think it's a parallel situation
at all.

What will be your relationship
with the Democratic party in the

future? Will you seek their
endorsement?
Flahert_y: Well. I seek an open

primary. and while I don't seek
endorsements I do welcome the
support of Democrats. all Demo-
crats. _

I simply don't believe that
endorsements are that meaningful.
Sure some Democrats will support
meancl some will support my
opponent, and they have that right
to choose and I say they have that
right. Ijust believe that an open
‘primary is the place to do the
choosing.

This doesn‘t mean I push
Democrats out. or shun supporters.
On the contrary I seek the support
of all Democrats.

How do you feel about Dick
Schweiker [Pennsylvania Senator
who will oppose Flaherty] getting
the official labor support?

Flaherty: I think the labor
leaders’ made up their minds before
they even knew who the candidates
were. You would expect labor to at
least have an open forum on the

situation like anyone would in the ‘

democratic system. .
Apparently Schweiker is their
captive. He has voted 100% with
the labor bosses of Pennsylvania,
and it looks like there was an
alliance there before anyone else
even got into the picture. I don't
make such alliances. My exper-

ience is that people at the top of the
labor movement don't speak for the
rank and file.

itself merely reacts to the bills the

_‘r~\President presents--they are react-

ing instead of leading.

Your ideology seems similar in
some respects to Herbert Denen-
berg’S {who will oppose Flaherty in

the Senate race]; How would you’

distinguish yourself from him?
Flahert_y: I've been an adminis-
trator here in Pittsburgh.

reduced the taxes. The state

After all. Pittsburgh is at the

You can be successful
without compromising your princi-
ples if you have good legislation
because you'll have the support of
the people. '

How would you gauge the impact
of the Watergate Scandal on the
credibility of government office-
holders, local and federal?

Flaherty: People are going to be
a ‘lot 'more careful’ about their
selectﬁion of candidates. They're
going to look at each individual to
see if he is a man of integrity,
They've seen enough of the
political bosses and their miscon-
duct. The public is not going to let
them get away with it, they will

process. even the most serious
offenders. The President would
necessarily be in that category.

Despite all of the activity in
Watergate and the misbehavior I
see. it would not be proper to for
me to prejudge impeachment. I
think we should await the
President's appearance before the

' House Judicial Committee. I think

he is entitled to that. We should
also await this report by Wilbur

Mills about the tax aspects of the’

President's case.

I know it's good politics right
now to yell impeach the President.
but if you are going to sit in a
responsible position and judge the
man I think you ought to wait for

’ the Judicial Committee findings.

President Nixon has defined
impeaehable offense as that which
is strictly a crime, while Rodino’s
.Committee-‘ l1as~:-defined. impeach-'

ment more broadly. Who do you
agree with?
Flaherty: I think that the

Judicial Committee's position is
the right one. that it does not have
to be an indictable criminal
offense to be impeachable. Say.
for instance that you were the
President of the United States and
you never showed up for work.
Well. I'm not sure that's an
indictable criminal offense. but it is
certainly impeachable.

I tend to lean to the view that it '

need only.be misconduct, but it has
to gross misconduct.

Would you urge.President Nixon
to resign?

Flaherty: I think President
Nixon is a strong man in that he
resists news media and other
politicians telling him what to do.
If it comes toit. he_'ll have to make
the decision to resign himself.

Talking about the press, why
have you decided to be so open
now? We had difficulty interview-
ing you in the fall and the

T Pittsburgh reporters were irritated

when you granted interviews to
Philadelphia papers after' your
re-election. Could you explain
this?

Flaherty: We have many press
conferences here with the news

media. They're all invited and I
answer all of their questions
though some don't like my

answers. No member of the press
is excluded from a conference.

My press conferences are not
printed as questions and answers--
they are editorialized so that it
doesn't come out exactly the way I
said it. but I still have them
anyhow.

Ijust do my job. I was not elected
by the newspapers of Pittsburgh. I
was elected by the people of
Pittsburgh. Maybe the newspaper
publishers don't agree with many
of my stands, well. I'm an
independent. and that means
independent of the newspaper
bosses as well. .

Some people feel abortion will be
a hard issue in the coming
campaigns. What is your position
on that issue?

Flaherty: I have my own
personal feelings on it. I believe.
and these are my personal views.
there is life in the "prenatal state.

‘It's against my personal convic-
..-tionstto take human life.‘ Ordinarily

/

I'm against the taking of life in the

prenatal state with some limited 
exceptions. for instance. to ‘save 
‘the life of the mother or in cases

such as incestuous pregnancy, I see
exceptions.

What is your position on the
issue of gun control?

Flaherty: I'm opposed to gun
control. First of all the Constitu-
tional rights of citizens to own and
bear arms is built right into our
own system. I think there's good
reason for that. The criminal

element in society wouldn't comply \

with the law--only the good people
would comply. You can bet your
bottom dollar that the professional
criminals in this country aren't
going to give up‘ their guns.
President Nixon today called for
campaign reform. You have run

many clean campaigns yourself so 
>do you have any ideas on the

sub_iect?

Flaherty: I would plan limits on
the amount of contributions that
can be given any candidate. A Some
man gave $2 million to the
President's campaign fund. and I
think it's shocking that anyone
could put that much money behind
one man.

President Nixon has probably

come out with a good reform act, '

but for him to come out with it,

well. right now he's not the proper“ ‘

man. When the reforms come from
those who have taken illegal funds.
it makes ‘it difficult to place any
credibility on the reforms.

What direction do you feel the,__

country should take to deal with the
energy crisis?

Flaherty: I believe this whole
energy thing has been a hoax. and
don't get me’ wrong. I believe there
is a long range energy shortage,
but this shortage over the winter
was a hoax manipulated" by the big
oil companies.

These companies have the
protection of the American flag
anywhere they go. and when we
needed them most this winter these
companies were selling oil in Japan
and Western Europe where they
could get a better price for it.

We have enough coal here in
Pennsylvania to supply the energy
needs of the country for the next
couple of centuries. We're not
using it.. ,They’re overlooking
what's -right on our doorstep..

Forum Wliirls Around Marriage

BY LINDA SAVAGE

Marriages, traditional and un-
conventional, were the subject of a
symposium‘ held in the Ballroom
yesterday.

As key speaker in the all day
program » “Marriage-Go-Round,”
Robert Rimmer, full-time busi-
nessman and author, explored
alternate lifestyles to the tradi-
tional marriage.

Rimmer explained the books he
has written propose a society in
which extended sexual relation-
ships would be used as a form of
communication. Once this liberal
environment is created, he added,
then alternate lifestyles will result.

One of Rimmer’s alternatives to
the traditional one man, one
woman marriage is a structured
open marriage in which several
couples join together’ to live and

raise their families. In this
environment, Rimmer said, sexual
relationships willbe important as a
form of communication.

“One of the problems of a
multiple relationship is privacy,”
Rimmer said, adding if the people

involved are not careful the sexual

aspect of their relationships may
become more of an athletic contest.

Rimmer explained that his novel
Proposition 31 is about a hypothet-
ical experiment in which _ group
marriage of up to three. couples is
legalized in California. This type of
lifestyle will become more common
in the future, Rimmer felt.
“Monogamous marriage is going
to prevail in this country, but it will
deteriorate," he said, noting the
increasing divorce rate.

“One of the things to _add to this
total environment is a more casual

nakedness. Through all of the
novels I have written nakedness or
a warm general overview of it is
part of them.”

The recent fad of streaking was
well-received by Rimmer. He felt it
shows people are trying to get rid
of their hang-ups about completely
covering their bodies.

According to Rimmer, one of his
most popular novels in the college
community is the Harrad Experi-
ment, in which males and females
are assigned as roommates in a
college dorm.

“I don't know whether Harrad
would work," Rimmer said. “It’s
something to experiment with.” .

Showing of Stanley’

Black Comedy Succeeds 

BY M.C. PILECKI

Along with black consciousness
came a "wave of cheaply made,
highly exploitative ﬁlms capital-
izing on the need for an improved
self-image.

Denigratingly known as blax-
ploitation ﬂicks, the stories were
generally the same, that of a black
superman [or occasionally super-
woman] ﬁghting and fornicating
his/her way through the white
power structure. The movies were
short on plot, character and
technique, but bo’x office receipts

‘ said that this was what the people

wanted.

so now there‘s a new switch with
the “black ﬁlm" in Five on the
Black Hand Side, a fairly light
comedy now at the Stanley (who

has been lately catering to the

highly profitable black flicks).
When compared to I its violent
predecessors, Black Hand Side is
certainly refreshing.

But basically the movie is just a
black situation comedy with over-

: 
I

drawn characters, and heavy on tlfy

propaganda. It's frequently funny,
but the humor comes in inconsis-
tent spurts sandwiched in between

BY DAVID MAURER

If you are bothered by head-
aches, ulcers. depression, in-
somnia, high blood pressure. or
any other psychosomatic condition,
you might consider the latest
remedy. It's called Transcendental
Meditation, or more commonly,
TM.

When a person thinks of someone
meditating. he usually conjures up
an image of a guru sitting in a cave
in the Himalayas, having re-
nounced all worldly things in‘ order
to reach “enlightment." Pro-
ponents of TM say that all that is
necessary to practice the technique
is to sit comfortably, close the eyes.
and‘ begin to meditate. It is

I practiced for twenty minutes in the

morning and twenty minutes in the
evening. ,

Behind the TM movement is an
Indian monk," Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi, who first introduced the
technique in the United States
about 10 years ago. Since then, the
movement has been growing at
geometric rates. with nearly
400,000 Americans having begun
to practice TM.

Several well-lmown athletes in-
cluding Joe Namath and Eddy Bell
of the New ‘York Jets and
All-American basketball player Bill
Walton of UCLA are avid medita-
tors. The Pittsburgh Pirate
baseball team has announced that
its Spring training will include a
voluntary course of TM instruction.

\

The Pittsburgh Steelers are also
reported to be interested in a
similar program.

The International Meditation So-
ciety. one of six organizations
created by Maharishi to promote
TM, reports that the average age of
meditators has now jumped to 29,
indicative of the off-campus effort.

Due to the extremely subjective
nature of TM, the experience is
difficult to describe. As one TM
pamphlet explains the process,..."
Basically, TM brings about a
profound state of restful alertness
in the meditator. The experience is

not only easy, but also very_
enjoyable. After meditating. one
feels rested, relaxed, and more

alive to his environment.

When the mind transcends the
most subtle thinking activity, it is
expanded to a state of pure
awareness, its own unlimited
reservoir of energy and intelli-
gence. Through personal instruc-
tion. anyone can learn this
technique and begin to enjoy this
Contact with the source of thought,
the inner field of pure creative

intelligence. The benefits that
come from the practice are
cumulative and automatic, en-

riching all aspects of life."
That description may not be very

clear, but the scientific research‘

done on the effects of TM is. ‘ It
appears that TM has the capability
of normalizing and, thus, im-
proving the functions of the
nervous system. The research is

really just beginning.“ but the
results found so far. are eye-
opening.

For example, a study published in
The Scientific American [Feb,
1972] shows that during TM, the
subject experiences a reduction in
oxygen consumption and metabolic
rate of 1 % after a few minutes of
meditation, whereas a person
experiences a drop of only 10%
during the deepest point of sleep.

Other studies indicate that TM
produces marked changes in
cardiac rates. cardiac output.
galvanic skin resistance, and
breathing rate.

TM appears to have a potential in
dealing with drug and alcohol
abuse. Studies funded, in part, by
The National Institute of Mental
Health, show that the longer a
person meditates the less is his
desire for alcohol, drugs, and
tobacco. The US Army and the US
Bureau of Prisons have "recom-

mended TM as a drug abuse
alternative. Indeed, studies
carried on at The Stanford

Research Institute show that an
overwhelming reduction‘ of drug
abusers stop their use of the drugs

after six months of practicing TM.‘

Many religious and mystic cults
have sprung up in recent years,
probably reflecting a growing
difficulty many Americans find in

coping with the fast-paced lives\
-they live.

However, over 4,000
Americans have been trained by
the Maharishi to teach the

Study of City's People

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

A city's people should be a major
focus in studying urban history.

said Dr. Samuel Pitt
professor of history.

Speaking at the Historical Society
of Western Pennsylvania, Hays
stated that in the past, only the
major events in a city’s develop-
ment and its political leaders were
examined, so a city’s people were
left out of its history. Pittsburgh is
no exception, Hays added.

He noted the different religions,
races} ethnic groups, incomes,
levels of education and standard of
living helped to make groups of
people distinct and diverse in a city
and in its development.

When examining a city's people,
Hays said, an urban historian
needs to look at three categories--1)
the relationship between the
newer. outer areas of a city and the

Hays,

 city's older, center ones, 2) human

movement, both in and out of a city
and up and down the social scale
and 3) the centralization of
institutions. _

As an example, he said, the
newer and older areas of an urban
area like Pittsburgh are compar-
able in their types of businesses.
The older part of the city had its

\ established businesses and mer-

‘chants such as store owners who
couldn’t expand because of the lack
of space, Hays said.

“The chances of-new enter-
prises," he said, “brought lmany
Irish and Germans, up to World
War I, to become involved in

actions in the peripheral (outlying)
sections. Because of the large
room to expand in‘ the peripheral
regions, new industries developed
like the steel industry.

“The newer sections of the city
represented new political attitudes.
The new political leaders were the
industrialists like Carnegie.”

The growing numbers of factory
workefs followed the new leaders
whichresulted in a shift of support
from the Whig to the Republican
Party. Hays added.

On urban migration, he said:

“There is an enormous amount of

human movement in and out of the
city. The census might show a
growth of 100,000 in a decade. But
perhaps as many as 500,000 people
might move in and out of the city in
a 10 year period." ‘

According to Hays, as groups of
people acquired higher incomes
and standards of living, they
gradually moved out of their
communities and away from the
city’s center to the outer areas.
“The German community in South
Side, when they became more
prosperous, moved up the hill to
.Mr. Washington.” '

The city council after 1833 was
not elected on ‘a city wide basis
but rather on a ward basis, Hays
explained. “There was a repre-
sentative from each ward elected to
council who reflected theyviews of
that community."

The city has centralized city
council system that is elected on a
city wide basis instead of a ward
basis. - '

(Cami/zunl from Page I)
supervisory personnel. And you
know what happens when you let
men run around without super-
vision. Your whole system breaks
down."

Concerned about the adequacy of
training, Fadzen said, “I don’t
think a man should be put on the
street without some initial train-
ing...

“As these changes (in law) take
place. some on-going regularly
scheduled in-_service type of train-
ing is necessary so that a man is
able to cope with the constant
changes in criminal procedures.
law and the methods of operation."

In comparing training for cam-
pus policemen with city police
training. Fadzen said, “When you
talk about a municipal police
officer. you're talking about a
situation that hasnoiboundaries.
When you're talking about the
private sector, then the police
agency does have some definite
boundaries.

“I think there are certain

basics--how to put a case together,

investigation, report writing--that
would remain the same. Here you
might have more; in the way of
security of buildings.” '
When asked for other reasons
leading" to the birth of the
commission. Fazden replied‘, “I
think there are those who would
say my leaving spawned it. I don't
know if this is exactly the fact. I
think the fact the Pitt News in the
past has become strongly involved
in sharp differences within the
police department itself (has
contributed to this belief)."
Fadzen said the decision by

Dutton and Skrabut to transfer the
police department from under the
Health. Safety. Parking and Secur-
ity division to ‘directly under
Operations was a temporary move.

“In my opinion,” he said, “there
were some inherent weaknesses in
the other structure and now
through this they’re perhaps going
to alter the structure and do away
with those weaknesses. I don’t
mean personalities "in any way--‘I’m
talking about the system.”

Fadzen re‘-stated his denials of
any personal conflict with Joseph
Gil. director of the Health, Safety
and Parking division. "There are
some men who do have some
difficulties with Joe, but I had no
‘difficulties with him although there
are those who would like to
intimate that I did. I think they
would like to make more of it than
is really there.

“I think that perhaps someone
like myself with a law enforcement

background was able to see some I
,--problems that escaped someone

without any such background.
Maybe the men mistook this and
thought I was having problems
with Joe and I really wasn't."

Fadzen hopes he can instill some
adaptabilitiy to ‘the police force.
“Probably the mark of a good
police department,” he said, “is
that department that is ﬂexible
enough to flow with changing social
attitudes. What you might need
today might not necessarily be
what you’ll need one year from
now, depending on what the
climate of the times is.
you can construct a department
‘without so much rigidity, you’ve
found» the solution.”

potential of the individual to
insuring world peace, a virtual
utopia.

Teachers in TM seem to think that
many people believe that TM
involves a religious belief of
adherence to an Eastern philo-
sophy. They are quick to point out
that nothing of the sort is necessary
to enjoy the full benefits of the
technique. '

There is a course fee required of
all who take the TM course. The
cost is $45 for students and $75 for
adults.. This “commercial” aspect
of the movement has sparked
critism, but the Maharishi’s
followers defend the course fees as
being “an economic reality." The
money goes toward paying the
teachers and toward funding “The
World Plan." Indeed, the
movement has taken on some
heavy investments. ’

In Santa Barbara, California, the
Maharishi has established a
nationally accredited University,
Maharishi International University.

 
 

According to Maharishi, its pur-
pose is to institutionalize the
teachingsiof the movement “for
generations to come." The
curriculum includes becoming a
teacher of TM, interdisciplinary

' studies in view of T_Iv_l_Aphi1osophy,

andimonth-long periods of inten-
sive meditating reaching as much
as eight hours a day.

Probably the most ambitious of
the movement's ventures is their
proposed establishment of a
world-wide television network with
which they hope to bring the
knowledge of TM into “every living
room in the world. Unrealistic as
this may sound the TMers are very
serious. . The Veda-vision Engi-
neering Co, a division of the
University in Oakland, Calif., is
currently developing an inexpen-
sive type of video equipment. The
device, which is very close to
assembly, will cost about one-

fourth of the conventional type's _

cost and have 1,000 times as much
clarity, owing to the use of laser
beams.

The Maharishi says that there are
seven states of consciousness that
are humanly possible. “They are
waking. dreaming, sleeping.
transcendental consciousness
(during TM), Cosmic conscious-
ness. God conscousness, and
ﬁnally. Unity consciousness." The
whole purpose of TM, he says, is to
allow the individual's conscious-
ness to expand systematically."
With normal meditation, the
meditator can expect to ﬁnd
himself in Cosmic Consciousness
(en1ightment)\ after ﬁve to eight
years of meditating regularly, he
says.

This may all sound far-fetched.
but, whatever TM is, it appears to
be fast growing. It would be a
mistake to completely dismiss it.
Perhaps TM is the kind of answer
that our spiritually bankrupt world
is craving for.

sadly unsubtle appeals to plack

tries to intercede. And daughter
Gail (Bonnie Banfield) is insisting
on an African wedding. over her
father’s objections.

What really gets things going,
though, is when Gladys Brooks
|Clarice Taylor], declares that now
that her daughter is married and
her sons can take care of
themselves, she is leaving her
husband. Her friends advise her of
the infeasibility of her plan, and
decide to turn her into a new
woman instead, with her own
demands for rights. Well, Mama

joins son on the roof while they

both go on strike, while the
controlled little world of John
Henry gets quite shaken.

So this is not the greatest plot in
the world. But there are some
really good scenes, like in Brooks‘
barbershop. where the town
characters come to do their thing.
and the door is defumigated when
an undaunted female crusader tries
to enter. The dialogue is spirited
and a lot of fun to listen to, but the
scene is slowed down a bit by the
too-enthusiastic laughter of the
shop's hangers-on.

The best scene in the entire flick
is when Gladys gets to declare her
liberation. Her hair is cropped to
an Afro. a length of cloth is draped
around her “like an African

queen." and she drunkenly storms

into the men-only barbershop
announcing "the queen has come
to see the king." And when she
hands her list of non-negotiable
demands to her loudly misogynistic
husband. the house comes down.

Naturally John Henry comes to
see the error of his white-
conforming ways. and takes pride
in his African heritage while
beginning to respect the rights of
his wife and children. And
everybody gets to feeling pretty
good at the end.

Most of the characters are more
like caricatures here. John Henry
is the super-macho keeping a
too-tight hold on‘ his family,

I. particularly stifling his wife. He’s

painted as the same kind of
unthinking chauvinist that Archie
Bunker has popularized, with the
result that it’s. hard to feel much
more humorous contempt for him,
although Jackson instills a proud
strength into the role.

Gladys is definitely the strongest
character of the movie. and Taylor
does a great job of showing a
woman throwing off the shackles
and keeping the love. She perfectly
shows the hesitant. long pent-up
anger of a woman who has been
trampled as “wife and mother" for
too long. but doesn't want to hurt
anybody to get her way.

The other characters have less
chanc_e for development. The two

sons are mostly throwing the public‘

service messages to each other.
and the daughter is too stiff and
rather spaceheaded. lronically.
with her marriage. the daughter
seems to be entering the same kind
of relationship her
breaking out of.

The film is blatant propaganda. a
situation that hurts the comedy and
docsn’t help the cause it's
promoting. Getting an appeal
across to an audience is usually
done better with more subtlety. like
a subliminal message. There's a

MORGANTOWN, W. Va.--In
what could have been the ‘most
boring NCAA-tournament game in
history. the Pitt basketball team
advanced to the Eastern Regionals
by defeating St. Joseph's here
Saturday, 54-42.

The Panthers will meet Furman,
75-67 upset winners over South
Carolina. in Raleigh, N.C. Thurs-
day. Tickets for that game go on

sale at the Field House tomorrow at-

9 am and the game will be televised
by channel 4.

St. Joseph coach John McKinney
may have written the definition for
“deliberate" in Webster's diction-
ary. Pitt decided to give the Hawks
some of their own medicine, and
the result did not have the fans‘ on
the edge of their seats.

the game upt Itt ahead to stay, but
the Cats didn't break the game
open until the ﬁnal minute of the
game.“~

The scoring proceeded agoniz-
ingly slowly, and with five minutes
gone, Pitt led 4-2. The pace didn't
pick up any throughout the half,
and Pitt took a 25-16 lead into the
locker room.

Both teams’ poor shooting
St.
Jo's shot a dismal 22.7% in the
first half, while Pitt shot 35.3%,
better, but nothing to write home
about.

game. Mickey Martin, who shot
one for six in the first half, canned
all five attempts in theisecond to
keep Pitt with the 8-10 point lead
they held for most of the game.

“My shots just weren't falling in
in the first half," said Martin in the
noisy Pitt locker room after the
garrfe. “At halftime, I justtold
myself to shoot with confidence,
and they started going in."

After building up a comfortable
40-29 lead, the Hawks rallied with
eight straight points, cutting Pitt's
lead to threewith 7:53 left to play.
The Panthers committed several
turnovers during this streak to aid
the St. Jo's cause.

. Pittcoach Buzz Ridl called time
out at this point and_ put the
Panthers into an even more
deliberate style of play. They
responded with six points before
the Hawks scored, then added
seven more to wrap up the game.

“Our defense was exceptionally
good out there," beamed Ridl.
“It's a tribute to Fran Webster

BY BART MACK
Associate Sports Editor

 

Now you take this basketball team, St. Josephs. Well I really hadn't
heard much about them until they were named along with LaSalle as
possible opponents for the Pitt Panthers in the opening round of the
NCAA regionals.

And Saturday at Mountaineer Coliseum, Morgantown, West
Virginia, all the talk was about how St. Joe wasn't even a pre-season
pick to do much of anything in the" post-season. “Grim, grisly and
gruesome" were the words used to describe their pre-season outlook

- by one Philadelphia writer that was supposed to know something about

college basketball.

But, nonetheless, with a 19-10 record there was St. Josephs in the
first round of the NCAA tournament against Pitt, a team with a 23-3
record, the team that had maintained a 22 game winning streak during
the season, a team that_had it not gone to at ‘least the NIT would have
lost its head coach, the team with a formidable All American candidate
in Billy Knight, the team with one of the most respected defenses in
the East if not the country, or to be short about it, the odds on favorite.

You could have fooled me.

In the locker room at half time, the two teams could have switched
uniforms and the difference wouldn’t have been noticed if it weren’t for
the shaved heads that a few of St. Joes’ players sported.

And if I picked up a rather anticlimatic atmosphere in the victory
locker room, it wasn't much of a surprise. This opening round, the
NCAA Eastern Regionals. the first step in what has the opportunity to
be the fulfillment of the dream of every college basketball player in the
nationfwas really nothing more than just another game to some of the
Pitt Panthers. ‘ ’

“I really wasn't psyched that much myself," said Mickey Martin,
who led Pitt with 12 points. “Sure there was a lot of pressure, but it
was just another game on the schedule."

For Martin, the psychological element involved in preparing for a
game might not have that much of an effect on his play (his play was
one of the few bright spots for the Cats) but for the others, if they were
certainly didn't show it. ~

.  ,cal'tipaign ‘'

Now I hate to, point, but no matter how many people tell me to cut
Billy Knight a break and get off his back, I, always keep returning to the
fact that he is undoubtedly mired in a scoring slump and really isn't the
Billy Knight that helped Pitt enormously in building that streak.

Knight knows he hasn’t been playing up to par and admits it.

“I know I've been up for the games," Knight said, pondering his

' performance against St. Joes as he sat with the nets from one basket
freshly cut, drooping from his hand. “But the way I've been playing it
might not look like it." ’

If you've picked up the newspapers, magazines etc. that have carried _

articles on the success of Buzz Ridl and his Boys. you couldn't help but
notice the emphasis placed on the fact that Pitt IS NOT a “one man
- team."

Granted the fact that there are very few teams around that can rely
entirely on a single player to carry them through the big ones
constantly, but also remember that the best collegiate teams in the
nation DO have those’ players that they can always turn to in the tight
situations. If you b ave realistic thoughts about Pitt advancing
throught the NCAA, you’ve got to start comparing them with teams
like Providence and N.C. State. Those that have seen Knight in top
form know what the man can do and the consequences Pitt might suffer
if he's not having the good night. ,

When Knight hits, the feeling of confidence spreads and everybody
knows just where the basket is. Mooney didn't receive all of that All
America publicity courtesy of Dean Billick and the Sports Information
Department". " 4

I'm not trying to pin the Panthers’ performances of the past few
weeks on one man because it does take five men putting out 100% to
win the big games. But Billy Knight will have to go and go well if«the
Panthers are to meet either Providence or N.C. State on March 16. He
might not be the heart, but he is deﬁnitely the pulse of the team.

And if the pulse is weak, well, the rest of the body doesn’t stand
much of a chance for recovery. Victory over St. Joes by the wayside,

Penn State took two individual

the vaulting and Jim Kreust, who
was ranked as the number one

on the high bars. Kreust ﬁnished
behind the Whalen brothers in
third place in the all-around title.

Perez was disappointed, as were
his gymnasts. “They didn’t
perform as well as they had
hoped,” said the first year coach,
who completed an outstanding
campaign.

“We were more nervous than we
anticipated in the compulsories.
There were too many small errors,
and several breaks in the rou-

tines." he continued.

Mental nerves may have taken
their toll on the young gymnasts,
but there were physical pains
which hindered the Pitt perform-
ers.

A T racksters Victims Of

(Flu Bug At Nationals

BY RICK STOUFFER

The Pitt Tracksters, who have run
away from just about every
competitor all year, couldn’t run
away from the flu bug over the
weekend as they traveled to the
NCAA Championships in Detroit.

“Our guys weren't the only ones
with the flu." said a hoarse Coach
Banner. Everyone it seems had a
man with the bug.”

Sick or not, the tracksters didn’t
give up. The two mile relay [Rich
Jackson», Rich Marhley, Rick
Weaver, Chuck Mozingo] missed
qualifying for the finals by a tenth

of a second, but according to
Banner it may have been a
blessing. -

“Rich Jackson (who had been sick
all week and was doubtful to make
the trip up until Thursday) ran sick
in the qualifier. The next day (the
finals) he was even worse, so in a
way we were lucky.”

Sickness hit the distancemedley
team of Jack Patrick, Bob O’Neil,
Tom Moore, and Nick Martin also.
Martin, the standout mile man all
season had they big too.

“Nick gave his all but he just
couldn’t do it. Regardless we still
just ‘missed qualifying,” according
to Banner. V

Tim Riley, who ran_ into a lot of
bad luck in the previous two meets,
(missed the landing pit for high
jumpers) appeared to be in top
form. ‘

“Tim looked the best he had in
three weeks," Banner said. “Be-
cause of such a large ﬁeld of
jumpers (over 20) the judges
started out at the 6’10” mark which

was a huge mental jump for
everyone."

“He (Tim) wasn't gun-shy,”
Banner continued.- “His back is

still bothering him but he hung in
there."

The big success story for Pitt was
Billy Rea who placed second in te
long jump with a leap of 25’13/4”.

_ First place was taken by Colorado’s

Kingsley Adams with a 25’3”.
“Billy did a tremendous job taking
second,” Banner said. He’s made

V All-American for a least the fourth

time in his career.’

“Considering the shape everyone
was in they put out a tremendous
effort,” Banner" continued. We
were right in there. If it hadn’t
been for the illness we definitely
would have done a lot better.”

Now that the NCAA's are over,
the team will turn its attention to
the outdoor season where their luck
can only get better.

Paced by the three goal hat trick
of freshman winger Rick Vernon,
the Pitt Hockey Club continued its
domination of the Duquesne
Dukes, handing their down-street
rivals another shutout, 8-0, at the
Civic Arena Sunday.

The two teams closed out their

-7/‘fgegular season three game set, all

of which have reached the same
ends. The Dukes offense /ran up
against Pitt goalie Jumpin’ John
DeFazio for the third time and once

again could not find the combi-
nation to put the puck in the net.

DeFazio had help from the Pitt
blue line crew clearing the
rebounds as the Dukes mounted a
24 shotattack, the highest total the
Panther skaters have allowed in
that trio of games. DeFazio, the
WPIHA’s leading netminder with a
goals aginast average
rapidly dwindling under the 1.00
margin, was hardly tested as most

of the Duke's shots came from not

far inside the Pitt blue line.
With just two seconds left in the

Notre Dmne,  M(trquette

Favorites

I Notre Dame and Marquette
scored easy knockouts in the first
round of the NCAA playoffs

.-Saturday and established them-

selves as heavyweight contenders
for the national basketball title.
The Fighting Irish floored Ohio
Valley Conference champion Aus-
tin Peay 108-66 and Marquette
walloped Mid-American Confer-

ence king Ohio University 85-59,
and rolled into the Mideast
regional semifinals next week.
Notre Dame earned a berth
against the champion of the Big
Ten, which still was a question
mark after Indiana and Michigan
both won Saturday and finished in
a regular-season tie for the title.

y'(Continu:d on Page18)

that is"

second period, DeFazio was down
and out after making a save on a
shot from a right wing bad angle
and Duquesne’s Frank Szcurko had
the Panther netminder at his
mercy.

But before Szcurko could get a
backhand shot away, the siren

-sounded, locking the green light on

and the red light off, and the puck
hit the back of the nets in vain. It
was the closest the Dukes would
come to scoring all afternoon.

At the other end of the ice, the
Dukes started Bob Mitro in goal
but the Panthers afforded him no
preferential treatment that Fred
Wolkowitz, the Duquesne number
one goaler, would receive.

Mitro had to stop just 26 shots
but let the Panthers grab the lead
on a pair of shots that should not
have crossed the goal line.

Denny Browne started the
scoring by ﬂipping in a ﬂuke
rebound after Charly I-Iagins
breakaway shot hit Mitro’s pads
and rolled across the crease at 6:45
of the ﬁrst period with Pitt a man
short. It wasall he would allow the
Panthers in the initial 15 minutes
as some ragged play on both sides
determined the style of the game.

Vernon popped in his first goal at

Monday, March 11, 1974—THE PITT NEWS—Page 17

 Skaters Blank Dukes For 5:-d Straight

just 1:56 of the second period on a
wrist shot that Mitro will be
dreaming of for the next few days.
The Duke goalie had the high, hard
drive all but corraled in his glove
only to watch itjump out and trickle
into the net.

Charly Hagins picked up the next
Pitt tally when a Kerry Browne
drive from the blue line first
deflected off a Duquesne defense-
man in front of the net and then
bounced off Hagins,. to slip
between Mitro‘s legs.

The Dukes came back out for the
final period determined to get back
into the game but Pitt pounced on
some defensive mistakes by cap-
tain Dudley Cotton to turn the
affair into a comedy on ice.

First defenseman Russ Stump
and center Joe Testa came in
across the Duke’s blue line two on
one, with three minutes gone in the
period. Testa neatly sent Stump in
alone, who deked Mitro down to
the ice while firing the rubber in on
the open left side.

Vernon took the-spotlight again,
beating Mitro twice in 34 seconds
withthe last period half over. Both
goals came on partial breaks on the
right side "and the frosh winger
scored twice on backhand shots

from 15 feet that hit the left post
and caroomed into the nets.

The ageless blue line veteran,‘
kept his points-

Kerry Browne,
production respectable by blasting
a shot from the right point at 10:56
of the third period that drove

through Mitro's pads. ._Winger Bob _

Arturo, who had words on different
occasions with Duquesne's C.H.
Bender and Cotton, rounded out
the scoring by lighting the red lamp

on a breakaway just moments after»

missing on a previous chance in
alone.

With" just a game remaining
against Penn State (McKeesport)
tomorrow night at the Alpine Ice
Chalet, Pitt remains a single point
behind Carnegie-Mellon. ' The
Tartans finished the regular
campaign in the first half of
Sunday's hockey double header
with a 9-3 win over PSU.

43 points, in contrast to only 16 last

BY CONNIE GIEL
‘—The only good Penguin is a
young Penguin. At least, that
_secnis to be the philosophy of the
,Pittsburgh Penguin Hockey club
if After a series of rapid-fire,
.post-Christmas trades and firings
that left the team working on a
7‘skcleton crew, the Pens are
beginning to use their assets--
_vouth. strength, and newly-found
. ‘confidence--to gain a playoff spot in
the race for the Stanley Cup.

 New coach Marc Boileau has a
' lot to do. if not everything, with the
new attitude of the Pens. His
system of “dress ‘em and play
'em" leaves nobody warming the
bench. Line changes prevail, with
pa single game seeing swap after
 swap as defensemen skate with
forwards, both scoring. and both
checking. The players hum
 1' "getting to know you..." as they
find themselves working with
“strangers."

, The policy remains off the ice,
 too. with the guys telling of having
'7 to change roommates constantly
"-while on the road. And Captain
-‘Ron Schock is reported to have held
-‘V“more get-acquainted parties than

the U.S_.O."

 The fans are familiar with the
:-_styles of “old-timers” Syl Apps,
 Jean Pronovost, Dave Burrows,
L Ron Schock, and Lowell MacDon-
ald; but the newcomers have

identity problems. I Those up from
Hershey, the Pens’ farm club, miss

behind.

Ron Lalonde. 21-year-old left
wing. grins ruefully. “In Hershey I
was mobbed after every game by
autograph-seekers and fans. Now,
when I'm finally in the N.H.L., 1
walk down the street in Pittsburgh,
and nobody knows me."

Bernie Lukowich, bashful right
wing on the Pens‘ “kid line" of
Lalonde, Lukowich, and center
Wayne Bianchin. doesn't mind the
“undercover work"; -he's content
to remain in the background.
Unfortunately. his ability makes
him shine conspicuously, no hiding
in the shadows for this Penguin
potential star‘.

The Pens are gleefully pushing
their new musclemen out front,
too. Former St. Louis Blues Ab
DeMarco, Steve Durbano, and
“Battleship” Kelly had a field
game Saturday night as they
played their old teammates in a
televised game. Kelly got the first
Penguin goal from DeMarco, and
Lalonde came up with the second

Pens have been playing lately.
Confidence abounds in the first
period. tempers flare in the second
as the Pens’ lead slips, and in the
third period. a desperate scramble
to either regain the lead. or,
happily, hang on to the plus.
However haphazard their play may
seem, the strategy, or lack of it. is
paying off; the Penguins have been
unbeaten in their last five games.

Sportscaster Sam Nover summed
up the sentiment of both players
and fans as he put the wins in their
proper perspective, “I only hope
that it's not too late."

Right wing Ted Snell silences the
optimistic voices with an analysis of
the statistics. “In the west
division, Philadelphia and Chicago
have first and second place
wrapped up, and I don’t’ think
anybody’s gonna catch them. So
the scramble is between Atlanta,
Los Angeles, St. Louis, Minnesota,
and us. It looks like it’s. up to the
defensemen.”

Pressed about the role of
particular players. Snell was high
on goalie Andy Brown. “He's got a
great attitude about goal—tending.
He's not afraid of anything."
Brown has gained the consis-
tency of play that was lacking
earlier this season. Coach Marc
Boileau considers him “one of the
key men in our playoff hopes."

Brown's hot hand is matched by

that of back-up goalie Gary lnness.
a graduate of Toronto University
where he played "last year while
completing his degree in educa-
tion. lnness. the younger, larger
goalie. has put together a
respectable record while playing
second fiddle. Soft—spoken and
articulate. he says little about his
playoffhopes except that "it would
be a nice way to end the season."

Whether the enthusiasm is quiet

or bubbling, it is realistic. The
Pens face a tough three-game west
coast trip this week against Los
Angeles, California. and Vancou-
ver. Only six home games remain,
all of them crucial. Not only do the
Penguins have to win or tie most of
their games. but their west
division enemies have to do a little
losing, too. The possibility appears
favorable now that the Pens have
begun to roar and flex their scoring
muscles.

Powered by three-time All
America Bill Walton. the UCLA
Bruins trounced the upset hopes of
Crosstown rival Southern California
82-52, to give the defending NCAA
champions the Pacific Eight Title,
Saturday night on the Trojans
court.

The game was over by halftime.
for all practical purposes, as the
Bruins streaked to an overwhelm-
ing 47-13 lead. Walton, who scored
26 points and pulled down 20
rebounds on the night, did most of
his damage before the two teams
left for the locker rooms at
intermission.

The win over the Trojans came so
easily it shocked many of the highly

. partisan USC fans into silence at a

time when an upset of the UCLA
dynasty seemed ever apparent. I

The victory puts UCLA in the
NCAA Western Regionals next
week and gives the Bruins a good
shot at an amazing eighth straight
national championship.
