leave of absence.

“You don’t give up when it
looks like things can’tbe changed,”
said Bell. “We must look for an
opportunity to use our lives well
and have the commitment to try
and do something about it."

Bell is giving up approximately
$120,000, the annual salary of a
tenured professor at Harvard, until
a female minority is given tenure
at the Massachusetts university.

Bell’s speech on Friday at the
Pitt School of Law commemorated
the birthday of Martin Luther King
Jr., and kicked off Black History
Month.

He said people do not welcome
change. He added that this is
especially true of law school
professors because they are
satisfied with the status quo.

However, Bell said that he has

reprieve
from city

By Lisa R. Pugliese

The 1970s were filled with Pitt
football for Charles “Chuck”
Bonasorte. As a linebacker for the
1976 national-championshi p team
he often pitted his bruising, bone-
crushing style of play head to
head against the best in country.

Next Bonasorte would play
hardball with both Pitt and city-
code enforcers, challenging the
city’s vending laws and being
repeatedly cited forillegallyselling
Pitt paraphernalia on campus.

Now Bonasorte, who owns an
outside vending operation in
Oakland, claims “the war is just
about over,” following a reprieve
he received in court on Jan. 29,
which concluded that his vending
license had been illegally revoked
in September 1990.

“Everything seems to be
working together," said
Bonasorte. “The way the city [of
Pittsburgh] revoked my [vending]
license, then City Council voted
in new ordinances, and now
[winning] the court hearing.”

Back in 1989, when Bonasorte
first began his vending operation,
he had one cart with a few Pitt
sweatshirts and T -shirts hanging
from the iron bars which held the

other minority faculty, the
increased hiring of women and
the growth of clinical education,"
said Bell. “Student pressure was
the force that brought about these
changes.”

Bell is a self-proclaimed
advocate of diversity. He is
attempting to gain more diversity
in the faculties of universities and
has taken a leave of absence from
Harvard to protest the lack of a

Drugs, teenage pregnancy and a lack of
education are not the biggest problems facing
African-Americans today, according to educator
Jawanza Kunjufu.

These problems are only symptoms of an even
bigger problem: low self-esteem, Kunjufu told
students on Thursday.

Kunjufu’s lecture, “Developing Positive Self-
Images for African-Americans," was the first of
the Black Action Society's events commencing
the celebration of Black History Month 1991.

about yourself; you don’t deal drugs when you
feel good about yourself,” said Kunjufu. “America
does not have a drug problem; it has a moral pro-
blem, a discipline problem, a self-esteem
problem.”

Kunjufu, educator and president of African-
American Images publishing/consulting
company, said that drug dealers are serving as
bad role models for young blacks.

“I don’t know one brother or sister who sells
drugs for 20, 30 or 40 years, is not retired and
living off a pension. Our children see them as

can together.

Since then, he has expanded
substantially and in the process
has claimed he was harassed by
Pitt and city inspectors who
repeatedly changed the rules
under which he was operating.

A letter written in September
1990 by Louis Tronzo, director of
federal and local relations at Pitt,
to the Pittsburgh Public Safety
Office stated that Bonasorte had

An adequate 24-hour study area,

SGB urges awareness of union issue

The possibility of Pitt faculty unionizing was a concern of Student Government
Board President Brent Saunders at the SGB meeting on Wednesday.

“This is a very serious issue which will have great effect upon the students of
the university,” Saunders said. He encouraged interested students to go to the .

student groups. In that letter Golden urged

the departments to appoint undergraduate

representatives to the committee.
Getting the committee together with

support from the university and the students
is Golden’s first priority.

“A number of people have already
approached me about it,” he said. ‘I think

it will take off once the organizational
structure is set up.”

Golden, who feels faculty support is
vital to the success of the acadernic-affairs
committee, met with College of Arts and
Sciences Dean Mary Briscoe. Golden said
Briscoe was happy about contact with the
SGB because the faculty is frustrated about
student apathy.

A new reference guide to courses,
professors and teaching assistants will be
one goal of the committee. The amount of
reading required for a course, along with
the cost of books, interest some students
before they register for a class, Golden
said

Unintended pregnancy increasing among college women

By Jackie Estkowski
‘For Ibo Pitt, News A

It was a warm sunny afternoon inJuly——
a perfect day for a wedding.

Friends and relatives crowded into the
Sacred Heart Church in Shadyside. The
bride-to-be stood in a little room in the
back of the church. The sun was shining
through stained-glass windows and onto
Molly’s‘ strapless, white-satin wedding
gown. Soon it would be time.

When the wedding march began, Molly’s
father placed her bridal veil over her face.
She picked up her bouquet of white and
yellow silk roses.

A tear rolled down her cheek, and he
hugged her tightly. He wiped her tears

away, and they proceeded arm in arm
down the aisle.

In July, Molly was a blushing bride. In
November she was the proud mother of a
healthy baby boy. Molly, now 20 years
old, was a sophomore at the University of
Pittsburgh when she learned that she was
pregnant.

Unintended pregnancy among college
women is increasingly becoming a
problem. A survey published in the
November/December issue of Family
Planning Perspectives found that in 1988,
56 percent of all pregnancies in the
previous ﬁve years were unintended or
earlier than desired.

Because pregnant women 18 years of
age and older are able to make legal and

confidential decisions affecting their
pregnancies, relatively no data on college
pregnancy exists.

‘No one counts unplanned pregnancy
by college students,‘ said Luther Sheets, a
nurse practitioner at Family Planning
Services of Western Pennsylvania. ‘We go
by the age group.’

Teenage pregnancy continues to soar,
he said.

Molly falls into the 19- to 21-year-old
age group and is among 75 percent of
sexually active women entering college,
Sheets said. Ninety percent of men are
sexually active upon entering college.

According to Sheets, sexually active
college women are more motivated to use

However, Jan DeVoe, a representative

On the surface, Julie Cardenas appears
to be like most students. She carries 18
credits, is working toward a degree in
Spanish and commutes to class every day.

Upon talking with the 21-year-old junior,
however, one learns that she is responsible
for another life.

Not only is she a full-time student at Pitt,
but she is a full—tirne mother as well.

An average day in Cardenas’ life involves
getting herself and her 18-month-old son

up and ready for the day. She takes‘-him to

day care and then takes the bus to Oakland
for a day of classes from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

couples use advertising to directly
arrange an adoption.

Hilary and-Allen’, who are in
their 30's, are one of those couples.
They have been experiencing
fertility difficulties for several
years. In  searchfor a child,
they have visited a fertility expert
and sought the help of a private
adoption lawyer, two very
expensive paths to ‘parenthood.

they »pla_cedtheir first newspaper
advertisement to adopt a child.

Advertising could greatly
shorten their wait for a child,
Hilary explained.

“We have a friend who adopted
in six weeks through an ad. Some
people are luckier than others,"
she said. “The first week we ran
an ad, we had a call, but it didn’t
pan out. We talked to [the
pregnant woman] a couple of
times before. She actually went to
the next step [to talk to the
lawyerl.”

However, the woman declined
to fill out the rnedical—history forms
the lawyer requested, and she did
not re-establish contact.

Hilary said the “next step” —
contacting a couple's lawyer — is
important because ‘the girls
realize then that it's serious.”

Though their first response
didn’t work out, the couple
recently began the process over
again and are in the early stages
of communicating with a
expectant mother in Texas.

Area clinics

When a woman is pregnant,
there are many choices she has
to make. I She» V must
decide whether to continue or

terminate the pregnancy. Giving .

the child up for adoption,
financial concerns and whether
or not to continue her education
are also problems that need to be
considered.

The list of questions and
alternatives continues on and on.
Because pregnancy is such a
personal subject, many women
opt to go to a local clinic for
guidance because they can
maintain anonymity and do not
need to fear rejection.

In and around the Pittsburgh
area, many clinics and hospitals
offer services to help women
during and after pregnancy.

Planned Parenthood of
Pittsburgh, a pro—choice
organization, offers pregnancy-
deterrnination tests, counseling
services and abortion procedures.

According to Francine Hurwitz,
director of communications,
Planned Parenthood offers non-
directive options counseling.
‘After confirming that you are
pregnant, our counselors talk
openly and honestly about all
the options that are available,’
she said »

Because Planned Parenthood
is a pro-choice organization,
counselors include abortion as a
possible alternative.

According to Hurwitz, most of

 

the women who opt for abortion
make that decision before
pregnancy is positively confirmed
by a physician.

“A lot of women know whether
they are happy or unhappy about
their pregnancy,‘ she said ‘We
are not in the business of talking
women out of abortion‘

Those who feel that abortion is
their only alternative, however,
must have extensive counseling.
The women are counseled by a

oft consist

nurse practitioner after
undergoing their first exam. A
second session is held by a
physician and nurse practitioner
before the scheduled abortion

‘We want to take the time to
make sure the woman is firm in
her decision,’ said Hurwitz. ‘A
woman may be adamant about
an abortion in the beginning, but
then she comes in and she's not
so sure.

‘We provide a very nurturing

See Mom, page 6

information

environment at Planned
Parenthood. We don’t push
anyone into a decision. Our
policy is that our patients should
do what is going to be best for
them."

Although Planned Parenthood
offers abortions, the clinic does
not see many abortion patients.
According to Hurwitz, abortion
procedures make up only 1
percent of the center’s services.

“We don’t see that many
abortion patients. It’s not very
convenient because the physician
who performs the procedure only
comes in one morning a week,”
she said.

Planned Parenthood refers
women to various clinics and
hospitals for abortion services,
adoption, further counseling,
support groups and prenatal care.
“We assess our patient’s needs
and refer them to agencies that
we feel are legitimate medical-
care providers,” she said.

Many organizations scare and
mislead women, said Hurwitz.
“They offer no counseling about
birth control, speaking of chastity
as the only alternative,” she said.

“We talk about birth control,
whether the pregnancy test is
positive or negative. We want to
try to eliminate the possibility of
a woman being in ‘a similar
situation," said Hurwitz. ‘We are
here to promote healthy
sexuality.’

In the medical ~ social-work

prevention and intervention in
health care. The blood-pressure
testing and cholesterol-screening
booths were the most popular
among the exhibits promoting
early illness detection.

According to Haberman, the
planners of this year’s health fair
chose to “view health as
multidimensional." She deﬁned
social and emotional well-being
as very important inﬂuences on a
person's overall health.

The heavily frequented
massage- therapy booth was
promoted as a way to deal with
physical and emotional
discomfort. Haberman said that
massage therapy promotes
relaxation that can be helpful in
dealing with headaches and
stress-related problems. She
hoped that exposing students to
massage therapy will prompt
them to consider using “non-
pharmaceutical” means of
relaxation.

Most of the 3,000 students who
attended the health fair left

related accidents.

Dr. Shirley Haberman, a health
educator for Student Health
Services who headed the health
fair planning committee, thought
the mocktail booth was an
important tool to increase student
awareness of alternatives to
alcohol.

Haberman said that awareness
motivated the planning this year's
health fair.

“We hope to increase student
awareness of health resources on
and off campus. We hope the
information students are exposed
to will encourage them to adopt
healthier lifestyles," she said.

She said that promoting
awareness of health resources
among students will encourage
them to “assume personal
responsibility for their health
instead of getting a doctor to take
care of them all of the time.”

Haberrnan said one way of
accomplishing this is to stress the
positive side of health. She said
most of the exhibits emphasized
the importance of illness

Pitt students packed the
Assembly Room of the William
Pitt Union last Wednesday for
free drinks.

The fact that the drinks did not
contain alcohol did not decrease
strident interest and enjoyment
of the annual Student Health Fair.

Close to 1,000 of the students
who attended the health fair
sampled “mocktails” -- non-
alcoholic mixed drinks.

“Our goal is to facilitate
education and awareness of
responsible drinking and alcohol
awareness," said Mary Wyandt,
president of the Student Health
Advisory Board, which sponsored
the mocktail booth. She said
students should learn that “you

counseling about the different options
available, including abortion, adoption
and continued pregnancy.

‘We provide options counseling. We
don’t try to sway a wornan’s decision,‘
said Becky McCheskey, a medical social
worker at Magee. “We help them reach a
decision they feel comfortable with and
think is best”

McCheskey feels very good about the
counseling offered at Magee and said
there are many important factors that
enter into a woman’s decision.

“We sort through their concerns, feelings
and readiness for pregnancy. We lay out
their options and tell them we are available
to help sort through the different
possibilities," she said.

According to McCheskey, there are social
workers in every hospital unit.

“If you decide to continue your
pregnancy and seek prenatal care at Magee,

there are designated social workers in that

I

division,” she said. “We have different
social workers depending on a woman's
individual needs.”

Genesis of Pittsburgh also offers

{counseling and pregnancy testing. Unlike
other clinics, however, they offer a hot
‘line that is open 365 days‘ a’ year and

housing at the center in Bellevue for
pregnant women.
Although there are no age constraints

on who can reside at Genesis House, most
of the women are around high-school age.
According to Carol McMahon, executive
director of Genesis of Pittsburgh, continued
education is emphasized.

‘We don’t want them to drop out of ‘

school. We urge our girls to utilize the time
they have and focus on their studies," said
McMahon.

State-certified teachers volunteer from
local school districts in order to provide
young women at Genesis House with
private tutoring. Volunteers from several
institutions provide additional instructional
services, such as nutrition classes.

The house in Bellevue is the only housing
center that Genesis operates. Genesis
House can only take in nine women at one
time, so host families house the women
until an opening is available in Bellevue.

The counseling sessions are available
on a one-to-one basis and are held by one

of three counselors. The subjects covered -

in the sessions include child care, future
planning and parenting.’

Genesis House cannot house women
after the birth of their babies, but it gives
mothers a place to stay while reviewing
their options; ‘ 1 i  '1

According " to McMahon, the program
focuses on decision—making.

“Usually ‘Unclejoe’ or ‘Aunt Mary’ knows
exactly what [the woman] should do. But
women should know their options and

make the decision that is right for them.
We want them thinking about every aspect
and playing an active role in who and
what they are,’ she said.

Pitt junior Stacee Barefoot, a member of
Students For Life, has a pe_rsonal
involvement with Genesis House; she
counsels girls who are considering
adoption. .

Barefoot is open about the fact that she
is an adopted child. Through her
experiences she hopes to help answer
questions and erase myths about adoption.

“I spoke to a girl who had questions
about adoption,” she said. “They are
confused about the myths and realities of
adoption. Because most of the girls are
very young, I think they feel more
comfortable talking to someone who is
closer to their age.”

Barefoot thinks the most important
aspects of Genesis House are the emphasis
on continued education and the family
atmosphere.

The sessions focus on discussion about

of our clients have low self-esteem. We
build their esteem through counseling
and help them see themselves as good
people with bright futures,” Winter said.

Mom's House does not counsel parents
on the use of birth’ control because they
feel the information is readily available.
According to Winter, teens who had
previously been pregnant were given free
contraceptive devices in a federally funded
program. A 46-percent repeat-pregnancy
rate was found. '

* “Although we don’t offer counseling on
birth control, we have never had a repeat
pregnancy,” she said. ' 

“We work on their thinking processes.
We want them to ask themselves, ‘What is
the long-range impact? How will this affect
my future?”’ she said; ‘We “encourage
them to make decisions based on good
thinking and planning, not impulsiveness.

Kunjufu said that teachers
should look beyond educating
their students in the classrooms
and instead reveal a world that
shows the real results of drugs.

‘Take them to a prison, let
them see where they might end
up. Take them to a drug—abuse
program; let them see how painful
it is to withdraw. Take them to the
morgue; let them see where they
may end up," Kunjufu said.

On the issues of low self-esteem
and teenage pregnancy, Kunjufu
said a lack of goals often results
in making mistakes.

“We have found through re-
search that little girls that know
they’re going to Hampton [Univ-
ersity], know they’re going to
Spelman [College], know they’re
going to Pitt, have less chance of

getting pregnant. Where am I
getting at?” asked Kunjufu. “You
make silly mistakes when you

' know you have nothing to lose."

Kunjufu said even in education
African-Americans ridicule one
another when a fellow student is
trying to work up to his or her
full potential.

“It has gotten so bad that when
many of our youths are doing a
good job in school, they are teas-
ed. When many brothers are do-
ing a good job in school, they call
him a chump, a nerd, a fag. It has
gotten so bad that when they’re
on honor roll, they say, ‘Humph.
You’re acting white,’” he said.

“If being smart is acting white,
then what is being black? Do you
see what our children are saying
about their race?" asked Kunjufu.
"It’s obvious that Febmary is not
enough time to de-program these

children."

THE PIT!‘ NEWS. Monday, February 4, 1991

Adopt

Continued from page 3
couples considering adoption or

experiencing fertility difficulties.

According to Hilary, there are
many ways to go about adopting
a child.

“The ads seem to be the most
popular today,” she said. The
couple’s ads, which ran through
September, cost approximately
$400, which Hilary said is an
average amount to spend if a
couple wants a broad response.

Since not all 50 states allow
newspapers to publish adoption
ads, the couple received a list of
potential papers from their lawyer.
Even though the couple was
warned that “college towns don’t
often give a good response to
adoption ads," Hilary decided to
run a small one in Pittsburgh
college newspapers anyway.

‘It reads: “Happily married
couple wish to give a loving
home to infant. Call Hilary and
Allen collect.”

They have had no responses
yet from the Pittsburgh area.
However, Hilary remains
optimistic about a child in the
future and is continuing fertility
treatments.

While individual couples
advertising to adopt is a fairly
new trend, several agencies and
organizations, such as Golden
Cradle, have been running ads
for decades in popular magazines
with a large under-21 readership
and college newspapers.

Jenny‘, an expectant teen who
has been living at the Pittsburgh
Genesis House for almost two
months, is planning on giving up
her baby for adoption. The
adoption of Jenny's child will
take place through Genesis
House, with her involvement and
suggestions serving as prime
factors in every step of the
process, Jenny said.

She voiced her disapproval of
adoption through newspaper ads.

“I don’t think that’s a good way
to go about it. It’s more like
buying a baby," she said.

Jenny’s concerns about
adoption through advertising go
further than her ethical objections.
Not all birth mothers have the

opportunity for strong
involvement that the Genesis
House adoption program allows,
she said.

Jenny said that few expectant
mothers can afford a legal expert
to represent their interests.

In most cases, “the lawyer is
more for the [adoptive] parents
than for the mother. If the
adopting parents don’t want the
same things as the girl, chances
are that the [adopting] parents
would get what they want, " Je nny
said.

“If she wants pictures [of the
child] once a year or a non-
smoking family, she might not
get that. For everyone to be
happy in this situation, it has to
be what both sides want,” she
said.

Bob‘, a father who has adopted
children, responded to the
questions about open adoption
thatjenny and other birth mothers
have raised.

“I can understand their con-
cerns," he said. “But most states
require a home study on
prospective adoptive parents.”

Bob and his wife, Karen‘, are
the parents of two children who
were adopted through ads. Like
many adopting couples, they
experienced infertility. However,
they did not attempt more
traditional methods of adopting a
child.

“We had unexplained
infertility," Bob said, “and most
agencies don’t want to let you
adopt unless they know you can
never have a [birth] child."

The couple learned about
adopting through ads at the APC
and within a week of placing
their first adoption ad, they
received a call. It was a month
before any of the calls were
“serious,” he said.

Bob said that Karen would
always answer the phone.

“We had a Snoopy phone [for
the calls pertaining to the ad],
and she would always smile
before she picked it up, so it put
her in a good mood before she
spoke to them,” Bob said.

When the call came that resulted
in the adoption of their daughter

six weeks later, Karen began
talking to the birth mother twice
a week. The couple was not
present at the baby’s birth, but
Bob said they met both the birth
mother and the birth father.

Karen is a volunteer support
counselor for the APC of New
York and also works on the
adoption hot line. “Anyone who
has major questions [...l calls me,"
she said. ,

“You feel like you have to
marketyourself, [and], there’s not
much you can say in three lines,”
Bob said. ,

Karen said, “I felt similarly, like
I had to sell myself. It’s a very
difficult thing when all you want
is a family and you have to
convince people that you’re a
wonderful person.”

She said that she recognized
that “there is a big controversy.
People feel putting in ads is a
horrible thing. But in New York
state that’s the legal way to do it.
It’s the only way for adoptive
parents to contact [birth] mothers,"
she said.

Karen said that before adopting
their first child through an ad, she
felt uneasy about the idea of
advertising. After she read more
literature on the subject and
successfully adopted her
daughter, she realized that
advertising is “providing an
opportunity to both birth parents

. , ,'I'heCommunistblochas changed

drastically in the past few years.

Democracy-dizzy East Germans
tore down the Berlin Wall,

Communism’s last reminder of
“happier” days (Fidel Castro not-
withstanding). The Chinese gov-
ernment got a little too trigger-
happy with some protesters in
Tiananmen Square. And according
to The Pittsburgh Press, the United
States put this giant bear to rest two
weeks ago by giving most—favored-
nation trade status to — brace

yourself -—-Mongolia.

; Iwas dumbfounded when I heard

the news. Granted, though formerly

. under a “hardline” government,

Mongolia has not had the “evil
empire” status of its neighbor, the
Soviet Union. It also couldn’t match
China's incredible record of hu man-
rights atrocities, as far as I know.

, Adam
Richter

Mongolia has pretty much spent
the last 70-plus years acting a lot
like quiet New Jersey — merely a
suburb for two major cities.

Most of my shock came in the
form of a single question: What on
earth do they have that we’d be
willing to trade our made-in-Taiwan
video-cassette recorders and auto-
mobiles for? “Snow” was the best
answer I could come up with.

But nonetheless, what’s the big
deal about trading with Mongolia?
It's a country that's mostly desert,
and a cold one at that. It has a small
record of producing some of the
most dangerous military leaders in

the world (and it HAS been a long
time since Genghis Khan). Not to
mention that, again, Mongolia in
the past has had the same impor-
tance as NewJersey in world affairs.

Actually, this softening of

Mong_olia’s hardline government’

may be the perfect solution for
those nitwits running the few re-
maining communist nations. De-
spite such events as the ousting of
the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, some
world leaders still believe commu-
nism works.

So now that Mongolia has sold
out to the ugly Americans, what are
these poor communists going to
do? Mongolia, that giant frozen
desert that once owned half of
Eurasia, befriended those capitalist
pigs. After years of chumming
with the Soviet Bear, the Mongo-
lian government is willing to trade

their Mongos (that's the name of
their currency, I swear) for dollars.

They’re probably thinking, what’s
next — fake—Gucci watch dealers

. outside the Gum department store

(in Moscow)?

And, just as there are Reds who
are dismayed, I’m sure there must
be some Westerners (besides me)
who ponder this issue as well.

Well, probably not many, but there -

might be a few. And justifiably so;
after all, trading with Mongolia has
such enormous implications for
our economy.

For example, there might emerge
some kind of “yak’s milk" health
trend from all the suits on Madison

Avenue. The commercial and mar- ‘
'keting possibilities for our

newfound trade partner are inﬁnite.

Government regulation raises gas prices

When Iraq invaded Kuwait last
summer, there were predictions
that by the end of the year there
would be oil shortages and gaso-
line lines similar to those of the
1970s. Of course we now know
that this didn't happen.

Why this difference? The answer
is simple. . S

Last summer, when a large por-
tion of the world’s oil supply was
threatened, the price of oil went
up. The increased price had two
main effects.

First, the higher price encouraged
oil suppliers to increase their pro-
duction. According to an article in
the Pittsburgh Press (Ian. 27),
“Other producing nations have
more than replaced the 4.3 million
barrels per day that have been lost
from Iraq and Kuwait.”

Second, the higher price en-

couraged consumers to use less‘

gasoline and other oil products.
Some commuters started riding in

    

 aniel
Alman

car pools, and others took to using
mass transit. People who used oil
to heat their homes might have
switched to other heating sources
or installed insulation, or both.
Because of free-market pricing,
supply and demand remain equal.
Every night on the news we hear
that the price of oil is changing.
This price is not just some number
picked at random. Instead, it is the

result of many different factors in
the oil industry.

In a free market, pricing acts as a
form of communication which tells
consumers and producers infor-
mation about supply and demand.
We may see a day when oil goes to

$100 a barrel, but as long as the ‘

government doesn’t control the
price, there will be no shortages.

During the 1970s gasoline prices T

were not determined by the free
market. Instead, they were con-
trolled by the federal government.

The government set ceilings on
gasoline prices. The government-
price controls distorted the com-
munication mechanism that had
previously been carried out by
free-market pricing. Without the
necessary information that occurs
as a result of free-market pricing,

pricing goes beyond economics.
Note that the first word of “free
market” is “free.” The primary issue,
which is much more important
than that of economics, is freedom. '
Allow me to explain. V

I remember that during the 19703 _

my father used to go out to wait in
line for gasoline. My father would
have preferred to pay a higher

price in order to avoid waiting in ,

line. In addition,‘ the people who
were selling gasoline wanted to
charge higher prices. Unfortunately,.
the government would not allow

this to happen. 7

If a buyer and a seller both
voluntarily decide, of their own
free will, to enter into a particular
transaction, then that transaction
should be permitted. By outlawing
gasoline prices which were above
a certain amount in the 1970s the
government was taking away
freedom. -

If two or more consenting _human
beings decide to enter into any

kind of relationship, then that re-.

lationship should be permitted. One
such type of relationship is a buyer/
seller relationship that includes a
particular price which is determined

_ by the buyer and the seller. By

outlawing such relationships, such
as by setting price controls, the
government was creating what is
known as a “victimless crime.” If
my father had paid higher prices

for gasoline in the 1970s in order to '
_ avoid the long lines, he would

have been committing a crime.
Fortunately for us, there are no
longer government controls on the
prices of oil and gasoline. Instead,
buyers and sellers are now free to
negotiate these prices on a-volun-

tary basis. And as long as this.

remains the case, there will be no
shortages. I promise.
And if you remember only one

thing from this column, let it be-»

this: The primary issue is not eco-. '

nomics; the primary issue is free-
dom!

Britain signed Kuwait, among

Kuwait as a separate state. Onjune
19, 1961, British protection of Ku-

that we must use our precious

Miami swim tearns to rip through Big East country

By Jim Lakely

- Staﬂ Writer

The University of Miami was synonymous with athletic
excellence throughout the ’80s. It has produced four
national championships in football, two College World
Series titles and two of the best divers in the world in Greg
Louganis and Wendy Williams. Next year the Hurricanes
will blow through the Big East Conference, shaking up
the swimming and diving scene.

Miami, currently an independent, has a strong swimming
program deep in tradition that will present an immediate
challenge to Pitt, the perennial conference champion.
But perhaps more importantly, it will give the annual Big
East championship meet even more recognition and
credibility. For years, the Big East Championship has
played second fiddle to the Ivy League-controlled Eastern
Seaboards. ‘

The Ivy League schools gear the Easterns for their own
advantage by choosing the time which fits into their own
schedules and not taking into consideration how long a
team like Pitt has to prepare for the meet. Miarni’s
addition to the Big East might change that

“Having Miami in the Big East gives us a viable,
competitive meet to be involved in,” said men’s coach

Chuck Knoles. “This will give the Big East Championships
credibility. [Our meet] won't be second class to the
Eastern Seaboards anymore.”

The addition of Miami to the conference not only puts
the Big East Championship meet on the same. level as the
Eastern Seaboards, but much to Knoles’ chagrin it knocks
the Easterns off of Pitt’s schedule.

Knoles is not alone in his enthusiasm for the move. This
is a sweet deal from Miami's view as well. The Hurricanes
have no conference meet in which to post NCAA
qualifying times, so the weak Metro National Independent
Conference meet in South Carolina is the culmination of
their season. This situation hurts both their swimming
and diving programs.

“For us it’s real important that we join a conference,”
Miami diving coach Randy Ableman said. “It will be
easier for us to get divers in the [NCAA qualifying meet]
due to the fact that you can earn berths through a
conference meet, as opposed to only going to a regional
meet where there are a limited number of spots available.
From a diving perspective, we are real excited about it.”

“We now have a conference we can score in and go
directly to NCAAs from.” said Miami head coach Richard
Cahalan. “It’s a conference where we will be good and
competitive.”

Bruins even season series vs. Pens at 3-3-1 with 6-3 victory

By Caroline Reich
For The Pitt News

The Boston Bruins evened the
score with the Pittsburgh
Penguins last night with a 6-3 win
at the Boston Garden, placing the
Pens under the .500 mark. Both
teams now hold a 3-3-1 series
record.

The‘No. 1 star of the game,
determined by the sportswriters,
was Ray Bourque, whose
dominating play anchored the
Penguins last night. Cam Neely,
who scored his 33rd goal of the
season, was named the No. 2
star. No. 3 went to newcomer
Ralph Barahona, who netted two
goals on the evening.

A questionable call came from
linesman Brian Murphy to referee
Dennis Morel in the third period
when the score was 3-1. The call
proved to be the turning point of
the game. Center Craig Jamey
was checked by Bob Errey, but
the referee did not see it. Linesman
Brian Murphy told Morel that he
saw Errey high-stick Janney.
However, on the replay there
was no contact with Errey’s stick

Womens Hoops falls to Providence

By Rob Mazur
saw’ Writer

After defeating the Connecticut Huskies last
Saturday, the Lady Panthers hoped to carry over
some of the magic of that win to their game against

Providence.

It was not to be, however, as the Lady Friars
handed Pitt a 108-97 loss, the team's third in four

games.

With the loss, Pitt’s record dropped to 11-10

overall and 6-4 in the Big East.

The Lady Panthers had to play with two of their
starters injured. Forward Jill McElhinny and point
guard Maureen McConnell are dealing with a leg

and a hip injury, respectively.

Her injury has restricted what she can do,’ said

penalty and a game misconduct
for high-sticking.

The Bruins scored two goals
by Glenn Welsey and Barahona
while Errey was in the penalty
box, putting the game over the
Pens’ heads at 5-1.

In the first period, defenseman
Ray Bourque scored the first goal
on a two-man advantage against
goaltender Frank Pietrangelo. At
12:34 Dave Christian scored his
27th of the season on the power
play, with Janney and Bourque
receiving the assists.

At the beginning of the second
period, Pietrangelo was injured
during a play and had difficulty
getting up. He continued to stop
the shots on goal but was unable
to continue. He was replaced by
Wendell Young.

Seven seconds later Boston
center Ken Hodge netted his 12th
goal of the season, making the
score 2-0. Randy Hillier scored
minutes later, with assists from
Barry Pederson and Coffey giving
the Pens their first goal of the
night.

game.

Part of that competition may spill over into the recruiting
war. With Miami throwing its hat into the Northeastern
recruiting circle, the ﬁght for good, young swimming
talent will be ﬁerce. But despite the added competition,
both Pitt and Miami look at it positively.

“[The addition of Miami] will help recruiting immensely,”
said Knoles. “Just to have Miami there gives us a lot of
credibility. It is a real plus to tell a recruit that we will be
swimming against a school like Miami.”

“It will really help with our recruiting,” said Ableman.
“It will give our program more visibility on a national
scale and will help us to get kids out of the East to come
down to Miami.”

The Big East Conference has begun to make a name for
itself on the collegiate swimming scene, and the Hurricanes
are very glad to add to that reputation. .

“Pitt’s diving program is the class of the Big East,”
Ableman said. “I’m a good friend of [Pitt diving coach
Julian] Krug, and I look forward to competing with them.
Krug runs a quality program; everyone in the diving
world knows that.”

“I think it is a great move,” Hurricane assistant coach ‘.‘

Wrestlers return from Blooms

By Bob Maselli
Staﬂ’ wruer

The Pitt wrestling squad
traveled to Bloornsburg University
on Saturday and came home with
results which exemplify much of
its season to date. The Panthers
lost to the Huskies 19-5 in another
close match, dropping their record
to 3-7.

Pitt has lost its last three matches
by less than five points, and this
is the sixth match this year that
the team has lost by under six
points.

“It’s very frustrating the way

things are going this year,” said
Coach Rande Stottlemyer. “We
wrestle well, but we can’t seem
to get [the winl.”

The Panthers are still having’

trouble in the swing matches (1 34
pounds, 167 and 150), and an
injury to starter Sean Gibbs (he
has missed four matches) hasn't
helped matters any.

“We have to realize that the
team that’s out there is the team
we have,” said Stottlemyer. “The
holes are just hurting us. The
season is quickly coming to a
close, and one of these days
these guys have to quit thinking

they're the underdog and go out
there and kick butt”

Grabbing victories for the
Panthers were Steve Budman (142
pounds), Scott Hovan (158), Jeff
Kloiber (190) and Perry Miller
(heavyweight). Ryan Sella (118)
wrestled to a draw in a hard-
fought match.

Stottlemyer was again pleased
with his winning wrestlers.
Kloiber totally dominated Tyrone
Howard, who is 23-6 on the
season, winning by a score of 4-
0. Stottlemyer was also happy
with Miller’s effort. Miller defeated
a 19-5 Donald Evans at

heavyweight, 4-1.

‘These guys are definitely doing
their part this season, and they
have to keep it up," said
Stottlemyer. ‘I applaud these guys
for keeping focused on what they
have to do. They know it’s a team
sport but also an individual sport
These guys have to start looking
ahead to NCAAs where they will
really have to wrestle well and
represent this team. And they
will.”

Stottlemyer knows it has been
a hard year to swallow, but he
still remains optimistic on the rest
of the season.

burg empty-banded

‘We don’t want to go through
what we're going through, but
it’s something you have to put up
with,” said Stottlemyer. “It's the
kind of season where you just
want to shoot yourself. We’ve
done the best we could with the
things we have, and we can live
through it. No one likes losing,
but we're holding together.”

PIIT BITS: Pitt’s next match is
Tuesday, Feb. 5, against Kent
State University at Fitzgerald Field
House at 7:50 p.m. The Panthers
will wrestle Penn State, currently
No. 1 in the nation.

Pitt hockey captures wins against Johnstown and Allegheny

By John Labriola
Staff Writer

The Mountain Cats of the University of
Pittsburgh atjohnstown ended Pitt’s (main

- campus) shutout bid when Dan London

scored four minutes into the second period
of yesterday’s game for a 14-5 Panther
win. The Panthers captured a shut-out on
Saturday against the Allegheny College
Gators, 5-0. _

Pitt opened Sunday’s competition b
netting four goals in the first period. “Our
goaltenders and our offense have been
playing offense very defensively,” said
Mark Uknis, Pitt’s defensive coach.

Uknis added that the Panthers’ success
is based on a total team effort on both
sides of the red line.

The second period had the Panthers
skating away with five additional goals,
while the Mountain Cats netted two goals.
Two Panthers netted hat tricks: center
Eugene Barilla and left wing Rich Skalosky.
It was Skalosky’s second hat trick of the
weekend.

During the third period the Panthers

‘netted ﬁve more goals, while the Mountain

Cats scored three more of their own.
The third period turned out to be eventful

for right wing Bill Crousey and center

Dave Koval. Crousey scored a short-handed

goal, and Koval scored the Panthers’ ﬁnal
goal of the game, his 20th of the season.

On Saturday the Panthers shut out
Allegheny on its home ice. Pitt opened the
game with a goal scored by Skalosky, with
assists going to Koval and Andy Ross, who
is the only Panther that has not received a
penalty this season. _

The Panthers and the Gators kept each
other from scoring during the second
period. .

“It was a totally different game,” said
Koval. “This time they were at home and
had their entire team with them."

The last time the Panthers and the
Gators skated against each other, the

Panthers had a 2-1 advantage.

During the third period Pitt netted four
more goals, bringing the score at the end
of the game to 5-0.

This weekend the Panthers will be
hosting the Mountaineers of West Virginia
University at Golden Mile Ice Complex in
Monroeville. Faceoff is set for 4 p.m.

“The game that the team is getting
psyched up for is against WVU,” said
Uknis.

The last time Pitt played West Virginia,
WVU played an excellent game. According
to Coach Uknis, the WVU squad was ‘able
to shut down the Pitt squad’s scoring.

At 9:39 of the third period Tony
T anti slapped in a Pederson
rebound for his sixth goal this
season, making the score 5-2.
Barahona got his second of the

‘ night, pushing the puck up and

over Young, and made it 6-2 at
the 13—minute mark. Mark Recchi
came up with his first shot on
goal for the night against Norm
Foster. He cut in on the short side

and beat Foster for his 27th goal
of the season.

The win was Foster’s first in the
NHL.

The Penguins’ 6-2 win over the
Boston Bniins Saturday brought
Jaromir Jagr the first hat trick of
his NH]. career and put the Pens
back in second place in the Patrick
Division, two points behind the
New York Rangers.

The victory was not without a
heavy price, however. Mario

Lemieux pulled a groin muscle
that afternoon and will not play
until Friday at the earliest,
according to head coach Bob
Johnson.

“Itwas just a groin pull. Lemieux
said that when he went to take
the faceoff, he turned around
and just strained it,” said trainer
Skip Thayer. “We’re just going to
treat it as a groin pull. There is no
evidence that it has anything to
do with his back.”

A source close to the Penguins
said that Joey Mullen will be
having surgery on Wednesday
on a disk in his neck, but team
doctor Chip Burke would not
release any information regarding
this statement.

When asked aboutJagr’s stellar
three- goal performance, Johnson

said, “Jagr has a good shot; he
likes to make those pretty ones."
Jagr had teammate/translator Jiri
Hrdina tell the press Jagr was
quite pleased.

Center John Cullen said, “Jagr
was unbelievable in today’s game.
Unbelievable.” '

At 9:19 of the first period, Jagr
netted the ﬁrst goal of the game,
assisted by Larry Murphy and
Hrdina, on a power play against
Boston’s rookie goaltender Norm
Foster. It was his 14th goal of the
season. _

Wendell Young stopped 21
shots on goal in the first period
and 31 overall as the Pens outshot
the Bruins 35-33.

Kevin Stevens scored at 2:51 of
the second period, with assists
from Zarley Zalapski and Cullen.

This was the second of four
Penguin power-play goals. Five
minutes laterjagr made it 30 and
second of the game at 7 minutes.
Boston’s Cam Neely came in with
a fast shot on goal at 11:26, on a
power play against Jagr for
tripping. It was Neely’s 32nd goal
of the season.

Coffeyscoredunassisted at7:03
in the third, his 21st of the season,
making the score 4~1. But Boston
wasn’t ready to give up. And at
9:49 the Bruins’ Graeme
Townshend, playing in only his
12th NHL game, scored his first
goal of the season, assisted by
Bob Sweeney and Allan Pederson,
to make the score 4-2. Two more
Pittsburgh goals capped off the
game for the Pens.

Continued from page 10
Fessler’s basket with 10:22
remaining, giving the Lady
Panthers a 71-70 lead.

During that stretch, Pitt backup
center Connie Hurt scored her
1,000th career point. She became
only the seventh player in Lady
Panther history to break that
barrier. She needs only 67 points
to move up to No. 6, a position
currently held by Jennifer
Shingler.

The Lady Panthers held a slim
one-point lead until the 7:48 mark,
when a three-point bucket by
Providence’s Tracy Lis put, the
Lady Friars back on top by two
points, 79-77. Baskets by Connie
Hurt tied the score at 89 and 91.
However, Providence again
pulled ahead, 95-91. A basket by
Fessler brought Pitt cut the lead
to two, 95-93, but that was as
close as the Lady Panthers would
get.

3 Providence used its experience

and pressure to go on a 13-4
streak to end the game.
Lis ended with a game- and

career-high 37 points, marking
the second time in two weeks the
Lady Panthers have allowed an
opposing player to score 35 points
or better.

“Tracy hit some clutch three-
pointers down the stretch,” said
Providence Coach Bob Foley.
“She has been doing this kind of
thing for us all year long.”

“She certainly can shoot. She
can take it strong to the hoop, or
stop and take the jumper. We
didn't do a lot to stop her," said
Bruce.

Not to be overshadowed by
Lis, Hurt scored 23 points, 20 of
those coming in the second half.

“I think that Pitt's Lorri Johnson
is the best player in the league,
without question. However, we
never can stop Connie Hurt She
seems to always do this to us. The
only answer we have is to stop
the ball before it gets to her,” said
Foley.

Saturday's loss followed a
disappointing road defeat at the
hands of the Georgetown Hoyas.

“We definitely had a letdown

Although it is a smaller, private school, Miami sports a top-15
women's swim team. The men's team, however, a power in the
past, is currently in the rebuilding stage.

“We have a very small team so Pitt will have an edge in depth,”
said Cahalan. “But as far as quality swimmers, we will be right
there with them.”

Cahalan and Knoles have a special, personal interest in the
move. They coached the Fort Lauderdale swim team to getherin
1989 and remain close friends to this day.

“We are real good friends," said Cahalan. “He is a good guy.
I'm looking forward to coaching against him. We have a friendly
little rivalry going. It will be fun.”

are sexually active and use some
form of contraception. But she
said they have never talked about
sex itself.

DeVoe said that couples feel it
is easier to have sex than to talk
about it.

“It is a couple’s responsibility
to communicate with each other,"
DeVoe said.

The Student Health Service at
Forbes Clinic helps to educate
couples and individuals on
contraception and sexually
transmitted diseases.

The following are five methods
of birth control and their
effectiveness, taken from a
Student Health Service brochure:

-Oral contraceptives (the Pill):
96 to 99.9 percent effective.

-Diaphragm: 83 to 97 percent
effective.

oCondom: 90 to 98 percent
effective (95 to 99 percent
effective when used with
spermicide).

0 Sperrnicides: 82 to 97 percent
effective (95 to 99 percent ef-
fective when used with condoms).

espongez 80 to 95 percent
effective.

For more information about
contraception or pregnancy
counseling, students should
contact the Student Health Service
at Forbes Clinic and make an
appointment.

“If someone had told me what
a class was really like, there are
some that I wouldn’t have taken,”
Golden said.

Golden said Briscoe was not
opposed to the new course-
description guide he proposed.
Briscoe would not, however,

support mandatory participation
by the faculty in making the guide.
Golden would also like a North
Oakland computer lab open so
students are not forced to walk to
David Lawrence Hall lab at night.
“Safety provisions for these
locations should

Jan. 30—A student stated tha
after leaving class in Clapp Hall
she was approached from the
rear by a man in his late thirties
wearing a brown waist-length

coat and blue jeans. The man
said, " Hi Peggy," she reported.

When she asked the man if she
should know him, he replied,

‘No, I'm just friendly. ” He stopped
following her once she entered
the book store.

Jan. 30-Police recovered an
army knapsack lying on the
ground near Benedum Plaza.

Jan. 31—A fire alarm was
activated in Tower A. The cause
of the alarm was apparently a
malfunction in the system.

The Pros Image

 

Vendor

Continued from page I
often illegally positioned his vans
on the corner of Forbes Avenue
and Bigelow Boulevard,
obstructing the view of both
drivers and pedestrians
attempting to cross there.

Bonasorte claims that a
photographer hired by T ronzo’s
oﬂioe took pictures of Bonasorte’s
trucks. “A couple days later [the
city] revoked my license,” said
Bonasorte.

Bonasorte said that Tronzo’s
letter was misleading.

“No doubt, I unload my trucks
on [the corner of Forbes and
Bigelow]. I have permission from
Pitt’s policemen and the city
policemen," said Bonasorte.

Until recently, vendors who
parked their carts on public streets
were required to move to a
different street every half hour
and could not return to their prior
space for four hours.

City laws have since been
changed, giving vendors the right
to remain at a given spot for one
hour at a time and also allowing
them to return to a prior spot

after being away from it for one
hour. The corner of Forbes and
Bigelow, where Bonasorte oper-
ates, consists of eightblock faces,
which means he can now remain
there for eight hours per day.

“I feel very relieved that there
are new laws allowing me to be
at [the comer of Forbes and
Bigelow] all day,” said Bonasorte.

Another law recently
implemented by the city requires
vendors to keep their stands 250
feet from one another.
Bonasorte owns two stands, he
has decided to sell all products
from one of them to Wayne
Bobak, an employee.

Another conﬂict developed last
year with the use of Bonasorte’s
business name, “The Pitt Stop,"
and a phone number on
Bonasorte’s truck. The use of the
number and name, which both
include the word “Pitt,” were
disputed by the university.

“Pitt wrote me a letter when I
first opened, telling me I couldn't

use the name ‘The Pitt Stop’

because it confused the students
and the people of the area and

Since «

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Monday, February 4, 1991 

was [property] of the university,”
said Bonasorte.

“I agreed and changed the name

to the Pittsburgh Stop. The
university agreed upon that
name,” he added.
. A suit is still in progress
concerning the phone number
which is painted on the sides of
Bonasorte’s trucks.

Bonasorte said there should be
no problem with it, since he took
the first four letters of his store
name and used them as a phone
number.

“I am using the first part of my
[business] name for the phone
number, and it is just a
coincidence that it happens to
spell ‘Pitt,”’ said Bonasorte.

“I don't want to sue Tronzo for
the [misleading] letters he wrote
about me,” said Bonasorte. “But
I'm not going to surrender the
phone number. If Pitt wants the
number, they’re going to have to
prove to me I’m misleading the
students.”

Bonasorte claims that although
he has no personal gripes with
the university, he has no desire to

be associated with it.

“I never in any way try to say I
am associated with the university,”
said Bonasorte. “I don't want to
be. The students here have a bad
taste in their mouths from the
high prices of ltextlbooks and
from the way the University Shop
was closed down last year."

All in all, Bonasorte feels that
the city and Pitt were wrong in
their accusations.

“It’s really ironic that on Jan.
29, the city of Pittsburgh was in
court fighting to keep my
[vendor’s] license from me, but
on Jan. 31, they granted me a
new one because they knew they
were wrong,” he said.

Bonasorte says that he does
not foresee any more problems
with the city but will proceed
with the suit concerning his truck
and phone number.

“I’m glad the ﬁght is over. It’s

back to business,” said Bona.sor’te., 
“It cost me almost $16,000 [in

legal fees] to ﬁght, and that's a lot
at $8 a shirt}?

Neither the city or the university
could be reached for comment.

carrying bags filled with
information packets. Pitt's Student
Health Service gave away
pamphlets that were, according
to Haberman, “developed from
student concerns and needs.”

The Student Health pamphlets
focused on preventing and
handling stress, rape and sexually
transmitted diseases. Haberman
said that Student Health made an
extra effort to make information
concerning health and diet
available to students.

Haberman said this information
is especially important. “The
media publishes so many studies,”
she said. “[Today’s students have]
a real need to get accurate
information.”

Saunders also announced that
Pitt President Wesley Posvar said
the university would reimburse
the SGB for the costs of opening
an alternate late—night study area
when the university improves its
financial status. Saunders did not
give details about how the univ-
ersity would pay the money back.

SGB member M. Chad Wertz
and Saunders have been working
on the SGB budget, which has
several discrepancies from last
term. ‘Last year’s board made a
lot of mistakes,” Saunders said.
“We're just trying to clean that
up.”

SGB member Gil Golden is
trying to establish a PittCard as an
alternative to cash for students
and faculty. The ID, which would
have a magnetic strip on the
back, would work like the Choice
Dollars program by withdrawing
funds from a personal account
Golden would like the PittCard
to be available for use in the
Book Center, the Student Health
Service, Rite Aid and Giant Eagle.
PittCard might also be combined
with Choice Dollars.
