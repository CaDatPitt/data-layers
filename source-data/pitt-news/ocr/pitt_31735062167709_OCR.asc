The variety of estimates of the crowd in
Washington, D. C., seemingly proves that it
was impossible to determine the number of
people who participated in the Moratorium
and Mass March last weekend. Estimates for
the Moratorium March Against Death past the
White House stated 45,000, but the numbers
for the Mass March ran from 250,000 to l,-
500,000.

Participants in the March Against Death
stepped off from the Arlington National Cem-
etery and marched pass the White House to
the Capitol, One by one, each carrying a sign
with a name of an American dead soldier or
a destroyed Vietname'se village, the protesters
moved single file in a silent procession un- _ _
til reaching the White House gates. There I s ' N 37 r 1} i v

marchers rallied at the end of the route. Pro- , _

within one block of the White House, where a if ‘ I i *

blockade. Bosses also blocked the‘way to the
White House at the rally area.

When they completed their one~haur march,
demonstrators were met at the Ellipse by
various anti-war speakers and singers whose
voices were carried over a gigantic loudspeak-
er system. lncluded in the program were Mrs.
Martin Luther King, Dick Gregory, Peter, Paul
and Mary, and Pete Seeger.

Workshops were held over the three—day
period and local universities sponsored ral-
lies Friday evening.

There were Ol‘3 two demonstrations that
turned violent, one against the South Vietna—
mese Embassy at Dupont Circle Friday night,
the other at the Justice Department Saturday
evening. The overwhelming part of the pro-
test against the war, however, remained
peaceful.

by DAVE TIERNAN
Editor, The Pitt News

If you would ask me to sum up
my four days in D. C. in one word
it would have to be the word “bea
utiful.”

Standing for three hours at the
Turnpike entrance waiting for a
fellow peace-marcher to give us a
ride was a cold, tiring experience
All toll, 15 of us came and wen
Thursday. The looks we got from‘
passing cars were priceless. Bu
once we were heading down the
pike and US. 70 to D. C., the cold
pains were being replaced by a
beautiful feeling. Cars, buses._
vans and cycles were on the road’
with us, all transporting people to
D. C. License plates told us that
some people had passed up a
shorter trip to San Francisco to
join the march in D. C. As the traf-
fic passed, smiles and peace signs
were exchanged. The beautiful
community spirit that prevailed
the entire weekend was ignited on
roads and highways all over the
country, long before the March
Against Death even began at 6,
p.m. Thursday evening. "

ONCE IN D. C., one was caugh
up in a mass of people. places. and I
events. We found lodging in a
lounge at Georgetown University
Dorm students were dragging

mattresses down the halls of the.
dorms, puting directions and no '
tices on the walls, making frantic .
phone calls to friends; every pos

sible effort was made to find
sleeping space for the visiting
marchers.

I passed the White House. tears?
filled my eyes. For the only time
of the whole weekend. I felt sick. 3 1
I felt no matter how many people
shouted. no one would ever hear.
No one would ever really know _
why Guadelupe wasn't marching:
or singing. or dancing. or making
love. or even just living. And the
bright, cold lights in front of the
White House made me feel that no 
one would ever really care. 

THURSDAYS TEARS were re
placed on Friday by tears of a dif
ferent nature. I was taking pic
tures of a group of American.
Christian Bhudists when the po _
lice decided that the group of j
marchers wandering from DuPont
Circle wasn‘t moving fast enough.
and tear gas would speed them on
their way. It did. but not before

curses and coughs filled the cold.

Saturdays sunshine replaced
Friday's rain. and the throng of
people marching to Washington
fMonument ranged in age from --
eight months to 80 years. in dres
from three piece suits to authentic
Indian blankets. and in vocation
 (according to the signs they car
ried) from longshoremen to col
lege professors. All were agains
the war. All were for peace. Al
added to the community spirit; th
cause; the movement. Words can
not express the feeling one has as
a member of a group too large to’
count.

AFTER FOUR days in a Utopi
an society. in a city filled with
people whom I love. and respect
and admire. and identify with. it-
is hard to return to the cold. ster
ile world here. It is hard. because 3
I realize that the spirit that hover

would just let it.

This past weekend. I thought
many times about the last lines V I
of a poem I read many years ago ’
——something about “truth is beau _
ty; beauty. truth: and that‘s all
we know and all we need to know.“
With all its sad moments. its few I
unfortuante moments of pain and
cold fear. when I think of thi
weekend I will remember crowd
-ed floors. burning candles. masse
of huddled bodies. smiling faces
sleeping bags. and a feeling of be
longing to a community that I may i
never recapture. It was the most

Report Facts
°Not Straight’

Gentlemen :

In your Nov. 5 issue. The Pitt
News ran an article on a report
that questioned the effectiveness
of the United Fund-Community
Chest and that concluded by sug-
gesting that those considering a
contribution to the United Fund
would be better off investing their
money in other social programs.
The authors of the report were
Dave Chavki and Norman Wein-
berg. two VISTA workers on loan
to Community Action of Pitts-
burgh, the local arm of the OED.

The report argues that Pitts-
burgh’s approximately 154,000
poor are not being "effectively
reached” through Chest agencies
that include the YM-YWCA’s, the
Salvation Army's Corps Centers
and the Y’s detached worker pro-
grams have been of demonstrable
effectiveness in the inner-city. As
for Goodwill Industries, it is
largely a self—sufficient agency
providing help to the handicapped
who are not necessarily the poor.
Goodwill gets less than five per
cent of its operating budget from
the Chest.

This report overlooks complete-
ly the other Chest agencies which
gear their services overwhelm-
ingly toward the poor in the inner-
city. These would include com-
munity centers, Boys Clubs, Day
Care Centers, Family and Chil-
drens Services, Visiting Nurses,
Action Housing, and the Urban
League. The last two agencies

Campus Hearings

alone receive well over $300.000 in
Chest funds.

The report, however. does men-
tion the Legal Aid Society and in-
troduces figures which suggest
that Legal Aid is doing nothing as
compared to Neighborhood Legal
Services. an OEO-funded agency.
What it fails to mention is that
Legal Aid gives free legal advice
primarily in civil’ suits (often di-
vorce cases) while Neighborhood
Legal Services handles mostly
criminal actions. Both agencies
do a fine job. Legal Aid (the Chest
agency) last year handled 5,8000
cases of people too poor to pay for
the services of a private attorney.
Those who could afford to pay were
referred to an attorney. Such re-
ferrals are not included in the 5.-
800 cases.

There remains the important
point that philosophically and or-
ganizationally the United Fund
was never meant to serve only the
poor. Its goal 25 years ago and its
goal today is to provide a balanced
program of community services
for everyone in Allegheny County.
Poverty is not the only require-
ment that one must present in or-
der to take advantage of these
services.

An item ignored in your article
is that an apportioned cost of fed-
erally-funded OEO programs is
borne by Community Chest funds
under the administration of Chest
agencies which include Hill House
Association, Neighborhood Center
Association, ‘Brashear Associa-
tion and Catholic Social Services.

Finally, there is a matter of
particular interest to those who
work at the University of Pitts-

. an

burgh. Last year the Health Re-
search and Services Foundation
(part of the United Fund) made
faculty grants totalling $282,000
to our Schools of Medicine and
Public Health for research pro-
jects. Thus. the United Fund di-
rectly returns to Pitt four times
as much money as it asks Pitt to
raise.

These are only a few of the rea-
sons why I feel that the United
Fund provides an appropriate ve-
hicle for community support. It
has its problems but it is constant-
ly reviewing its own operations in
light of community needs. Last
year. the United Fund allocated
35300000 to the Health and Wel-
fare Association to evaluate its
existing programs and made rec-
ommendations regarding the
needs of the community. This re-
port is due in 1970.

I sincerely hope that the Uni-
versity, community will respond

generously to the current United

Fund campus drive which will be
extended until Dec. 15 to permit
all University personnel‘ to have
an opportunity to contribute.

State Legislatures Seek Info

The higher education subcom-
mittee of the state house Commit-
tee on Education will hold two
days of general. information-gath-
ering hearings at the University
next week.

The committee. chaired by Rep.
James J. A. Gallagher. Levittown
Democrat.
Thursday. Nov. 20. and Friday.
Nov. 21.

According to the sub-commit-
tee‘s announcement. the purpose
of its visit to the Pitt campus “is
to promote an exchange of views
with students. finance officers.
deans of various schools. faculty.
persons in charge of student book
stores. and various representa-
tives of student organizations.“

The committee said that typical
subjects would include “the role
of students in University govern-
ment; the effectiveness of the
Commonwealth’s scholarship-loan
program; housing and dormitory
conditions; recruitment of the dis-
advantaged; and the quality of ed-
ucation.”

Formal hearings will beheld on
Thursday from 1:30 to 5 p.m. and
on Friday from 10 a.m. to noon
and again from 2 p.m. to 4:30
p.m. The formal hearings will be
held in the Social Room of Stephen
Foster Memorial Hall.

On Thursday evening. starting
at 7:30. the committee will hold
what it describes as an "informal
dialogue session" with students.
faculty and others in the Supper
Room of Schenley Hall.

Local arrangements for the
committee hearings are being co-
ordinated through the University’s
Office of Commonwealth Rela-
tions. Students, faculty “or admin-

will be at Pitt On.

istrators who wish to make ar-
rangements to testify may re-
quest an appointment by calling
the office on extensions 7477, 74
or 7514.

Each witness will be permitted
ten minutes of verbal testimony.
and the committee requests that
30 copies of formal testimony be
presented to it at the time of the
witness‘ appearance. The com-
mittee will reserve 20 minutes of
each witness’ appearance for
questions.

In its announcement. the sub-
committee said. “It is the inten-
tion of the committee to gather in-

Weekend At Pitt

"Out Of Staters” Solicited

formation from as many sources
as possible so that the committee
might recommend constructive
legislation which will improve the
present state higher education
system."

The Pitt hearings are one of a
series being held around the Com-
monwealth. Earlier, the subcom-
mittee met at West Chester and
Millersville State Colleges, Tem-
ple University and the Harrisburg
Area Community College.

Following the hearings in Pitts-
burgh. the committee will go to
Penn State on Dec. 4 and Edin-
boro State College on Dec. 11.

is another matter. one of no im-
portance to this letter.

You have‘ the right. even the
duty. to editorialize on issues
which are of primary importance
to the readers of The Pitt News.
However. you chose not to contin-
ue your stand. by the decision not
to publish.

This is only the second time. to
my memory. that The Pitt News
has issued a statement. and then
defaulted on its responsibility to
its readers to provide not only fol-
low-up support. but more impor-
tant. a forum to debate the state-
ment. The first time was the case .
of the not-so-final edition.

I hope that you are not setting
up a policy of suspending publica-
tion to express opinion. for that is
the easy way out of meeting your
responsibility. It will soon be not
what you print. but whether or not
you print. that is of importance.
How can you maintain a free and
expressive press. which I am sure
you would be the first to defend. it
you fail to go to press?

In an effort to maintain a substantial ratio of out-
of-state students. the University Student Govern-
ment. in cooperation with the Admissions Office. is
inviting qualified high school applicants to the cam-
pus for a weekend. Feb. 20 through 22 has been set
aside for Weekend at Pitt. Unlike previous years.
this year's Weekend at Pitt Committee will invite
students only from out-of—state and eastern Pennsyl-
Vania.

The weekend will be designed to give the pros-
pective students a tour of the campus. a chance to
attend an academic seminar in their field of inter-
est. and to see what life at Pitt is like. Pitt under-
graduates will act as hosts to the visitors.

The program will begin Friday night with a re-
ception for early arrivals in the Student Union. Sat-
urday's activities will begin with seminars in sev-
eral academic areas. In each seminar. an upper-
classman will discuss his major field of study. The
afternoon program will include an Activities Fa‘r.
campus tours. and a slide presentation. The Activ-
ities Fair will give some idea of the wide variety of
organizations on campus. A skit presented by up-
perclassmen will dramatize the day-to—day life of a

Pitt student.  Student Union dance Saturday night
will provide an excellent opportunity to meet and so-
cialize with upperclassmen.

Although Weekend at Pitt is designed for pros-
pective freshmen, parents will be able to attend
most of the programs. In addition, there will be a
coffee hour for parents on Saturday morning, when
they will have the opportunity to meet with upper-
classmen to discuss “Pitt Issues in ’70.”

Because of the limits of time. invitations to
Weekend at Pitt can only be issued to those students
whose applications have been received by the Ad-
missions Office before Feb. 1. In order to reach as
many prospective freshmen as possible. we are en-
couraging students to supply us with the names and
addresses of qualified out-of—state high school sen-
iors whom they feel would like to participate in the
weekend.

There will be an organizational meeting of the
Weekend at Pitt Committee on Wednesday. Nov. 19.
in room 501 of the Student Union at 7 p.m. All stu-
dents interested in working on the committee are
urged to attend this meeting.

  Jungle Cats Turn Back Army,  ‘

Second Half Comeback

THE PITT NEWS

SPORTS

by MARTHA HARTLE
Sports Editor
Carl DePasqua has been
worried all season about the
inability of this team to score
in the second half, but Satur-
day at Michie Stadium the Pan-
ther offense put 15 points on

g the scoreboard after intermis-

sion and the defense made it stand
up to give the Jungle Cats a 15-6
win over favored Army.

The victory was the fourth of
the season for the Panthers.
marking the most wins for the
gridders since 1963.

Displaying a well-balanced at-
tack. the Panthers churned out
189 yards on the ground and 151
through the air. while the defense

Eight Receptions

The Panthers also chalked up
23 first downs to the Cadets’ 12.
Fullback Tony Esposito turned in
another 100-plus performance, as
the 230 pound junior bulled
through Army defenders for 109
yards in 31 carries. Esposito has
now rushed for 693 yards on the
season, the most for a Panther
back since 1952 when Billy Rey-
nolds gained over 700.

But it was game captain George
Medich who had perhaps his finest
day in a Panther uniform. The 65"
senior split end from Aliquippa
caught eight passes. scored one
touchdown and set up another with
a circus catch on the one yard
line. “I don‘t want to sound greedy

but I should have had a few more ‘

catches." said Medich. "The guy
who was covering me was only
59”. so we workedon him."

Quarterback Jim Friedl broke
the passing record which he tied
last week. as his scoring toss to
Medich was his eleventh on the
year. Friedl completed 17 of 33
passes on the afternoon. hitting
Steve Moyer. Bill Pilconis and
Dennis Ferris in addition to Med-
ich.

The “experts” had made Army
6‘/2 points favorites at game time,
but it was the Panthers who spot-
ted the Cadets a six point lead at
halftime on the virtue of two Ar-
den Jensen field goals-—both com-
ing within the final 43 seconds of
the first half.

The Cadets drove from their
own 47 to the Panther 17. and with

fourth and one they elected to go
for the three points. Jensen made

good on the 34 yard boot. and Dave”

Garnett returned the ensuing kick-
off to the Panther 35. Trying to get
on the scoreboard before the half.
Friedl went to the air. but his third
toss was intercepted by sopho-
more linebacker Bob Coonan on
the 50. Fullback Ray Rittaco pick-
ed up 34 yards on a draw to set up
Jensen’s second boot. coming with
four seconds showing on the first
half clock.

The Panthers had two good
drives in the first half. but inter-
ceptions and fumbles thwarted the
scoring threat. A first quarter
drive to the Army 28 was stalled
when a Friedl screen pass was in-
tercepted by Coonan. Another
drive died on the Army 31 as Coon-
an recovered a Panther fumble.

Trailing 6-0 at intermission, the T

Panthers received the second half
kick-off and drove 66 yards in 17
plays with Denny Ferris crashing
over from the one, after the five
yard Friedl to Medich pass set up
the score. Gary Cramers’ conver-
sion attempt was wide and the
score was deadlocked 6-6.

The Cats controlled the football
for six and one-half minutes in the
scoring drive. with Esposito and
Ferris grinding out key yardage.

 Dykes Replaces Injured Naponick,

by"ED CONLEY
Associate Sports Editor

No onewill ever be able to call Panther defensive lineman

' Jack Dykes a braggart.

It’s not that the 6-1, 236-pound end will physically attack
anyone making such an accusation. Dykes simply doesn’t sound

. like the kind of guy who knows how to make outlandish boasts.

“.1 don’t really think——as yet—-that I have any good points,”

he said. “I can get some experi-
ence. Then. I feel I could play ade-
quately.

“I have one real bad point.
That’s handling offensive lineman.
You see, it’s our job to rush the
quarterback. And I have trouble
getting past lin wan.”

The Kiski Area gridder should
know what an offensive lineman is
like. He was one last April.

"I played offense in the spring."
he explained. "But I ju_t had to
think too much. I don‘t know. may-
be it’s just me."

The Panther press guide lists
Dykes as an offensive tackle, but
Saturday he demonstrated his
feelings about where he should be
playing. He certainly didn’t have
as much trouble getting to the
Army quarterback--or the ball
carriers—-as he thinks he has had
in the past.

“I started against Notre Dame
because Paul (Naponick> was
hurt.“ Dykes said. "He isn‘t quite
ready. He tried to play a bit
against Army. But I do feel it was
my best game. I can‘t say. though.
because I haven't much to base it
on.

Dykes’ effort in the Army game
was only a part of a defensive per-
formance that prevented the Ca-
dets from crossing the goal line.
And stressing the importance of
that units play were the five in-
terceptions and two fumbles that
the Panther offense yielded.

Like most Jungle Cat players
and coaches, Dykes knew the
squad would have their share of
good games this fall.

"After fall camp I felt we'd do
really great." he said. "Right

then. I saw the improvement. I
had never played varsity. though."

Dykes is playing for the varsity
now. And he may be starting again

next week in the Panther finale
against Penn State.

JACK DYKES
“Que real bad point.”

    Refuses To Note “Any Good Points’

The defensive end also displays
his modesty when he talks about
his team‘s chances against the
Lions._ He'll only say. "We have a
lot of confidence."

Ferris and Esposito moved the
sticks from the 48 to the Army 12.
where with fourth and five Cram-
er made good on his first field goal
attempt of his varsity career. The
27 yard boot was the first for
the gridders this season.

A fumble by Hall ‘on a punt re-
turn set up the Black Knights‘
only scoring threat in the second
half. but the defense stopped
Army cold in three plays and Jen-
sen came in for his third attempt
of the game. But the kick from the
36 on the first play of the final
quarter was blocked by John Stev-
ens.

The Panther defense bottled up
Army’s rushing game all after-
noon and the Cadets picked up
only one firstdown on the ground
in the second half. Highly touted
halfback Lynn Moore was held to
21 yards net rushing. The front
four of Stevens, Bob Ellis, Lloyd
Weston and Jack Dykes caught
Moore for losses totaling 18 yards.
Quarterback Wall was also a high-
ly touted runner, but the Army
signalcaller totaled ‘minus 18
yards Saturday. All together, the
Army rushing game netted a mere
74 yards.

Next week. Penn State.

On Plimpton
By Ed Conley

Associate Sports Editor

Last Tuesday a press conference was shceduled in the
Student Union Supper Room for George Plimpton, author

E of Paper Lion. Thirty minutes after the 3 p.m. start, the
. only professional journalists present were Ed Conway of
; WTAE-TV and Mike Brourman of the Post-Gazette.

Due to the lack of an appearance by other men of the

_ media, the public missed an opportunity to hear what an

interesting man sounds like.
But to my delight-and to that of a few Pitt News and

. WPGH reporters and Plimpton’s hosts——the sportswriter

consented to a lengthy discussion of the things that are
important to him. Enjoy George Plimpton . . .

On playing with the Boston Celtics:

“Basketball is the roughest game. You don’t realize
that until you play with the pros. You're in the middle there

; and suddenly there are elbows flying around your eyes.

And those guys can jump. You know, you're standing there
and all of a sudden you see a belly-button going past your

On pitching against the Major League All-Stars:

“They made some kind of agreement like giving $1,000
to the team that did best. I was supposed to pitch against
both teams. But things got a little rough. I think they had
to carry me off the mound. The balls were going way out of
the park. I only pitched to one of the teams, and I threw

. something like 90 pitches—some guys don’t throw that
 many inagame!” ‘

On Alex Karras, Detroit Lion star:
“Alex is one of the greatest guys I’ve ever met. Most

 people keep things inside them. But he says what he feels.
 He just has a certain way of saying it, too. I feel that I was
 real fortunate to have known him.”

On Hol1ywood’s version of Paper Lion:

“Hollywod almost ruined the movie until the last 30
minutes. That was all football. It showed how the pros real-
ly hit.

“That goalpost thing? Oh, I didn't do that. In fact, I
wanted them to cut that from the script, but they wouldn’t
do it.

“The movie was supposed to be about a guy playing
football with the Detroit Lions and winning his girl at the
same time. At the end when the guy hit the goalpost the
players were supposed to carry him off the field. And the
girl would drive up and he’d ask her where she was going.
She’d say something like, “Anywhere you want, big stud!”
I made them cut that!

“I was in Africa when the movie, came out. When I got
back I saw it in a small theater in New York. I sat in the
back row, and I enjoyed it.”

Nolan, Vornhagen Run

Today; Richey Injured  

by JERRY MYERS

With his squad reduced to a mere five men, Coach Jim Ban-
ner has decided to send only two harriers to the IC4A tourna-
ment at Van Cortland Park in New York City today.

Mike Nolan and Mark Vornhagen, both juniors, will repre-
sent the harriers in the annual Eastern Regional championships,

entering the meet as independents.

According to Banner. Mike has
been running the best he's run this
year during the last couple of
weeks. gaining him an opportunity
to compete in the regionals. while
Vornhagen has been a consistant-
ly good runner all season long. The
runners left for New York yester-
day by plane and they were joined
there by Coach Banner this morn-
ing.

A freak accident suffered by
all-American Jerry Richey will
keep him out of the IC4A’s, while
junior Greg Rodgers is sidelined
with a virus. Richey tripped on a
drain last week and sprained his

ankle. He's coming along, but

Coach Banner doesn’t want to run
him until NCAA finals, thus giving
him a chance to nurse the leg
more ‘gradually. Rodgers is bet-
ter, but he’ll wait for the finals to
get back into competition too.

The harriers have been running
everyday in the subfreezing tem-
peratures. preparing for the
NCAA’s. On Saturday six of the
distancemen entered an Allegheny
County meet in which there were
28 runners. A transfer student
from Penn State, Mike Schurko.
won the meet. Schurko is a junior
and will be eligible to run for the
harriers next fall.

Seven runners remain in action

on the cross country squad. These
include Jerry Richey. Greg Rod-
gers. Mark Vornhagen. Mike No-
lan. Dave Szabat. Bob Hagner and
Dave Cheseborough. Coach Ban-
ner has indicated that he will take
six to the finals on Nov. 24 but the
six have not been named yet. By
then Richey and Rodgers will be
back.

Double practices are scheduled
this week for Monday thru Thurs-
day keeping the harriers busy. The
cold weather doesn’t seem to
bother the runners too much. Bob
Hagner says, “At first it’s cold
but after about a mile you break
out in a sweat and the rest of the
way is easy.” The cold is felt the

   

most during short sprints when
there isn’t a chance to get the cir-
culation going. A

The harriers finish up their — It
