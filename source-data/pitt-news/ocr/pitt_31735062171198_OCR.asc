New Dean

by JOHN AMSON CAPITMAN
News Editor

On Thursday, Dr. Robert D.
Marshall was named Dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS) by Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var and Provost Rhoten Smith.
Marshall succeeds Dr. Jerome
Schneewind who is resigning to
resume teaching and research.

Marshall believes that the role
of the CAS Dean is to act as an
"advocate" for undergraduate
education within the University.

The 37-year-old specialist in me-'

dieval literature, maintains that
as Dean he must seek solutions to
problems resulting from the "po-
tentially opposing concerns“ of
the College and the University.
_He feels that he must also elim-

' mate the sense of adversary re-

lationships that may at times
exist between students and fac-
ulty."

Though Marshall doesnot have
any specific new programs plan-
ned, he stressed the importance
of keeping both students and fac-
ulty aware of the options which
are currently open to them.

"After the fervent period of

_change (several years ago) it is

important to make sure that these

‘changes do not become simply

routine, and thus lose their value
to the students." said Marshall.

Draftees

by DAVE MAJERNIK

Although the present Selective
Service law expires June 30.
many past draft violators are still
in trouble. I

According to the office of the
U.S. Attorney for Western Penn-
sylvania. draft violators have un-
til June 29 to enlist in the Armed
Forces and avoid prosecution.

David Curry, assistant U.S. At-
torney who specializes in Selec-
tive Service matters, said: “The
authority to induct men into the
Armed Forces under the 1971
amendments to the Military Se-
lective Service Act will expire on
Saturday, June 30. With the pass-
ing of that authority will go the
last opportunity for a young man
who has previously failed to com-
ply with an order of his local draft
board to secure his immediate in-
duction and thereby avoid crimin-
al prosecution.”

Curry said although men are

_ not now being inducted into the

Armed Forces. those who have
violated the law in the past will
still be prosecuted. He noted the
maximum penalty for draft vio-
lation is five years in jail and $10.-
000 fine. but added that those
convicted usually get lesser sen-
tences.

' Curry reported that 53 persons
from Western Pennsylvania have

been indicted for draft violation .

and have fled. usually. to Canada.

about the reasons and philoso-
phies behind the CAS curriculum
as it now stands.

Strike Criples

by JIM HOSEK

The heat wave is not yet over
for eight laid-off University car-
penters who are picketing for back
Spay-

Earlier in the week. other Uni-
versity employees (International
Union of Operating Engineers.
Local 95-95A, and Teamsters, Lo-
cal 249) refused to cross the pick-
et lines in sympathy with the Car-
penters‘ Union. which struck June
18. This created several problems
for the University.

Pitt Stadium, Trees Hall, and
Hillman Library were closed for
varying lengths of time, and many
of the University buildings were
without air conditioning. These

A and other disruptions continued

until Common Pleas Court Judge

A Livingston M. Johnson ruled Mon-

day that the operating engineers
and drivers had to go back to work
—leaving the carpenters fighting
their battle alone.

By Tuesday the heat wave was
almost over with air conditioning
operating in all University build-
ings. The . carpenters. however.
were still out in the sun.

The picket lines, which'origin- I

ally began around Benedum Hall
wvhere the Physical Plant offices
are) spread throughout the Uni-
versity this week. _

Negotiations are still taking
place between the University, Pitt
carpenters and the Carpenters,

are,” he said, “and if they ever
return to the jurisdiction of this
court, they will be prosecuted
since there is no statute of lim-
itation once an indictment has
been issued.”

Another 14 violators. he added.
are now awaiting trial while nine
other violators have been report-
ed to the U.S. Attorney‘/s office.
but their cases are still under in-
vestigation.

Curry pointed out that violators
attempting to avoid induction by
mental. physical, or moral dis-
qualifications must prove the dis-
qualifying condition existed at the
time of their original.induction.

“For example,” he said, “if a
young man was supposed to be in-
ducted on September 1, 1970, and
failed to report, then on Septem-
ber 2 he was in an auto accident
and lost an arm which disquali-
fied him from entering the Arm-
ed Forces. This person would still
face prosecution since the acci-
dent occurred after he was due to
be inducted.”

Acccording to Curry. a draft
violator can still avoid prosecu-
tion by volunteering to enlist in
the Armed Forces but will run the
risk. of being refused enlistment
due to "the higher mental. physi-
cal. and moral standards now re-
quired."

Curry said. "A man eligible for
Selective, Service two years ago

may not be ac_cep_table for_enlist- 

  
 
  

ment now.” The percentage of
violators who try to enlist and
are accepted is very small. he
said.

Asked if the enlistment option
to draft violators was a form of
amnesty as VSW leaders recently
charge, Curry replied that the
law has always read this way and
no recent changes have been made.

District Council of Western Penn-
sylvania.

The dispute began when the
University broke a three year
agreement. made in 1970. calling
for 50¢ per hour raises in 1971

and 1972. according to Bob Argen- .

tine. secretary-treasurer of the
District Council for Carpenters
of Western Pennsylvania.

"The 1971 increase was hon-
ored.“ he said. “but last year's
wasn‘t.“ In addition. the carpen-
ters were laid off not because they
had to be laid off. but because the
University was breaching a con-
tract. claim/ed Argentine.

The University, however, con-
tends that the workers were laid

off because Pitt was faced with a .
' number of federal and state fund

cutbacks.

Vice-Chancellor of Operations
Joseph Dutton now says that the
University “is optimistic that the
carpenters will come back to
work.“ provided they accept the
University’s partial pay retroac-
tivity offer before June 30. -

Dutton explained that because
of the mild winter a lot of the bud-
get for operations was not used.
Therefore. this money could be

University security personnel are trying. with
-some success. to stop bicycle thieves who commit
their larcenies during the spring months.

Use of a plainclothes police detail assigned to
check on bike parking areas appears to be the most
successful measure campus police have tried. ac-
cording to Assistant Investigator Charles C. Gra-‘

ham.

During the first 14 days of June, said Graham,
the plainclothes detail thwarted seven bicyle theft
attemps, and of seven bikes that were stolen, four
were recovered. Eight persons have been arrested
and the identities of two other suspects are known.

In contrast. said Graham, 15 bikes were stolen
in May. when plainclothes police were not being
used on an organized basis. Only one was returned.
and only one of three identified suspects was ar-

rested.

therefore, the University did not ,

Argentine expressed hope for
working out a contract classify- ..
ing carpenters as maintenance
employees. “First, however, the .
University should conform ‘ to its
other agreement,” which will .
soon expire. He said that full ret- A

Mead reported the average sen-
tencefor draft violation lately has
been 29 months.

To make up for the slack in draft
counseling. he said. last week the
center started military counsel-
ing. This includes counseling peo-
ple in troublewith theiArmy such
as deserters and those 0 gone

After June 30. he said. there
are three possible ways to deal

1. Congress will. do nothing and
the draft law_will die. ‘

2. The draft law will be continued.
but without induction.

3. The entire‘ draft law will be re-

intermingled with the freshman
that descended upon Pitt last
week were some 480 high school
students——all members of the Na-
tional Forensic League. The stu-
dents. representing 289 schools
and 41 states. were here to coin-
plete in the annual i\FL compe-
tition. -

Students who qualified in their

l\'l*‘L district or state competi-
tions were eligible to participate
in the six forensic categories: de-

bate. drama. girl‘s extemp. boy's

extemp. original oratory. and stu-
dentcongress. _

The big competition this year,
and apparently every year, was in
the debate category. Approxi-
mately 80 two-man debate teams
competed over the course of the
four-day competition until on
Thursday there were only two
teams left. Loyola High School,
California, debated Fairmont
High School, Indiana, on the topic:
Resolved that: All government

—Marshall believes that the state

_and federally caused budget cut-

backs and the freeze on faculty
salaries will not affect the office
of the CAS Dean to any great ex-
tent. '

"The Dean has a very small
budget ‘anyway. so‘ the cutbacks
will not affect any existing pro-
grams. The major effect. how-
ever. will be a little or no oppor-
tunity for initiating new projects.
The cut—backs will tend to slow
down experimentation and the en-
larging of the new freshman pro-
gram,".he explains.‘

Marshall is _concerned though"
that the cutbacks will effectva
“general change in the spirit of
the place,” since the feelings of

the faculty, who are becoming

‘fincreasingly concerned with
bread and , butter issues,” ' can.

iP.omo Policy Tampers
rWith First Amendment

The Supreme Court. in a 5-4 vote; last week reversed its
earlier position regarding pornography. The Court ruled that
7 states may enforce obscenity statutes against publications that
appeal to a prurient interest in sex. portray specifically de-f'ined

sexual conduct in a patently offensive way. and have no serious
literary. political. artistic. or scientific value.

The Court has endeavored for a long time to arrive at a
workable definition of obscenity. In the past two decades the
- Court has taken two stands on the question of pornography
’ which later proved infeasible. In 1957, in Roth v. United States
the Court held that obscene materials were not protected by the
-First Amendment. The difficulty with this stand came in defin-
'ing “obscene.” Since the 1966 Memoirs v. Massachusetts deci-
' sion the Court has censored only those publications which prov-
.~ ed to be “utterlywithout redeeming social value.” The problem
. with this criterion was that it was virtually impossible to prove
that something had absolutely no redeeming social value.

This most recent ruling promises to be no more feasible
than the previous two. The definition of "patently offensive"
and the question of substantive value are jus'as-illusive and
ambiguous as "redeeming social value." _ ..

, The new law as laid-down by the Court is still as unclear to
P’ the potential offender and still as wide open to the zealous local
. censor as the old.

_ The ruling gives license and encouragement to district at-
 torneys everywhere to act as public prosecutors of morals. As
any Pittsburgh resident can testify. this added encouragement
to an already zealous prosecutor could result in a police court
morality. ‘ '

.« ' Quite apart from the workability of these new guidelines it
.. is the ominous threat they pose to the First Amendment.

a i There are no Constitutional guidelines dealing with ob-
« scenity. The question of _obscenity probably doesn‘t even belong
" in the courts. It is there because of the insistence of a society
which suffers from it preoccupation with anda gross lack of un-
derstanding of sex. . ' ‘

..- As Russell Baker pointed out in a recent column, porno-
{graphy depicting those “unmentionable human parts” is no
;"_more obscene than “Last Vegas, the indigenous American fun-
eral, double-knit suits, -the road" side hamburger culture, the
 U.S. Air Force . . . the bombing of Cambodia.” ‘

. While the American public's tolerance of this list of tasteless
, American traditions is boundless. our tolerance for porno-
graphy involving sex stopsshort at the first glimpse of male
V genitals—provided no arguement for redeeming literary. politi-
,cal. artistic or scientific value can be made. Where is the re-
*-._deeming literary. political. artistic or scientific aspect of the
bombing of Cambodia‘? g
In this most recent rulingthe Supreme Court has focused
on the American public‘s fear of. and embarassment about sex
and tried to achieve. through the manipulation of the Constitu--
tion. a moral tone which will satisfy the American people.

The pitfalls of such a policy are obvious. As Justice William
«J. Brennan,’ Jr. points out in his dissenting opinion, “. . . if a
state may in an effort to maintain or create a moral tone, pre-
scribe what its citizens cannot read or cannot see, then it would
seem to follow that in pursuit of the same objective a state
,- could decree that its citizens must read certain books or must
see certain films.”

   
  
   
 
   
  
 
   
  
  
   
  
  
  
  
  
 
    
  
  
   
  
 

 

_, As Brennan emphasizes later. the states‘ interest in reg-
ulating morality cannot possibly justify interferring with the
guarantees of the First Amendment.
_ The idea that the First'Amendment permits the government
to" ban publications which are "offensive" to some casts doubt
on the future freedom of the press. As Justice William 0. Doug-
- ylas explains in his dissenting opinion. “That test would make
it possible to ban any paper or journal or magazine in some.
-benighted place." ‘

. An argument used. in favor of strict pornography laws is
it that obscenity impinges upon the privacy of non-consenting
at adults. The concept of a captive audience, as Justice Douglas

again points out, does not exist. No adult can be forced to read
a book or magazine or view a movie against his will.

,, If a barage of pornographic pictures in a drug store win-
f'_ gdow and the question of juveniles being exposed to pornography

poses a problem. or if indeed these are the real issues. they can
certainly be dealt with in ways which ‘do not compromise and
threaten the Constitution.

..\'either of these issues nor any others which have been
_ brought forth. to this date justify the damage to Constitutional
 rights which this latest Court ruling entails.

In its attempt to appease the professedly offended public
,A 1‘ morals of the American people. the Court has un-forgiveably ne-
1., glected its responsibility as protector of the First Amendment.

    

 

From Russiawith Love

by SCOTT MacLEOD

William F. Buckley. Jr.. in his
syndicated newspaper column.
claimed last week that the Unit-
ed States had nothing to gain from
improved relations with the Sov-
iet Union. stemming from the re-
cent summit between Secretary
Leonid Brezhnev and President
Nixon.

"What is it the Soviet Union
has that we want?" asks Buckley.

Gas he suggests, but vaguely
adds that the United States could
always use its own gas. Gold?
“We have gone out of business
of buying gold,” maintains Buck-
ley.

Dollars‘? “Yes." he continues.
"but the Soviet Union has no dol-
lars."

At this point in time. accord-
ing to Buckley. it is fruitless for
the US. to improve its relations
with the USSR. because they

_have nothing we want.

Buckley ads, “If Brezhnev in
a swoon of enthusiasm decided to

vative points this out. and it is
also typical of William F. Buck-
ley to insist on material values
at a time when they are unimpor-
tant and inapropriate.

President Nixon. saving skep-
ticism. has signed some vital and
"operative" agreements with Sov-
iet General Secretary Brezhnev.

Certainly. these changes in
American Soviet ideologies of in-

ternational relations are more im- .

portant to the peoples and lead-
ers of both nations than any of
the material goods Mr. Buckley
desires.

Brezhnev and Nixon signed nine
agreements. The most important
of these was a pact in "which the
United States and the Soviet
Union agree to work together when
any third country acts to “endan-
ger international peace and sec-
urity.”

Two others of significance are

designed to control the two coun-
tries‘ supply and use of nuclear

As Brezhnev said in his address
to the American people. "Man-
kind has outgrown the rigid
‘Cold War‘ armour which it was
once forced to wear."

Not long ago I had the oppor-
tunity to‘ meet three Soviet en-
gineersg They were extremely
warm gentlemen, sincere, notice-
ably proud of their heritage,
dispelling any cold warlimagery
I might have had.

Upon departing. one of them
took me by the arm and handed
me 21 kopecks as a souvenier.
"Here is for peace from the Sov-
iet Union to the United States."
he told me proudly.

It is this kind of relationship
with this kind of respect. that is
important for the United States
to gain from the USSR. and most
assuredly not the material pos-
sessions for which Mr. Buckley
asks. v

This warmth, the warmth in my
own experience, and the warmth
which I hope the American peo-

ple will find in the future, was

terial he could supply us with The 3gI“3€m9mS- the H1051

Nothing material.

ning of a new era of peace and

    Column and a Half

y JOHN METCALFE

A lhave been troubled in my mind about a re-

cent Supreme Court decision. an-d I am not alone.

The decision dealt with pornography; t/he Courtwas
against it.

This was not too surprisingly; by definition. al-
most everybody opposes pornography. That is.
each of us objects to any books. magazines. films.
or other depictions of activity which go beyond the
bounds of reasonableness. Here comes the sticking
point. Each of us knows perfectly well just where
the bounds of reasonableness lie. Very few of us

doubtthat we can distinguish art from smut. and do *

it on the spot. and hardly ever make a mistake.

Eachof us relies on built-in knowledge, but
there is no single species of built-in knowledge. Our
tolerances for the explicit are likely to be as di-
verse as our backgrounds. ' -

For a while. back when it was unfashionable to
legislate morality. the question was ‘solved by be-
ing dropped. In effect. pornography was whatever
offended everybody. and could find not a single de-
fender. For the rest. printers and filmmakers were
left to the dictates of their own taste and consci-
ences. if any. It worked.

The materials in question. whether pornogra-
phic. explicit. or merely expressive. was never fur-'
nished as a public service. It was not piped into
homes with the water supply: it was not given away
on the streets; it was not even added to the curri-
cula of the public schools. It was a business in the
same great American tradition as musical come-
dies or the Readers Digest. A market existed. and it
was supplied. for a price.

Indeed, the price was an index. Window shop-
pers in the magazine markets of Libery Avenue,
confronted with merchandise sealed in plastic bags,
could safely assume that the five dollar issues were
more explicit than the $2.50 cheapies. The people
whopaid five dollars to see Deep Throatprobably
knew they could expect something more than they
had found in The Cheerleaders. which played for
about two dollars per ticket.

There was some muttering. in the dim past of
a couple of weeks ago. that the purveyors of ex-
plicit material were a bit too blatant in their ad-
vertising. The mutterers must have been idiots; the
very blatancy of Liberty Avenue and Federal Street
were all thatprevented the exhibition of pornogra-

phic materials. lt would have been difficult to mis-
take the content of luridly titled films; it would not
have been difficult to guess what sort of magazines
were sold behind turnstiles which could only be
passed with proof of age. These were the ramparts
preventing pornography. Nobody who was likely to
be offended was likely to be offended was likely to
be exposed unawaresto such material.

All this has changed. It is now the. law that por-
nography can be defined neither as a matter of in-
dividual taste nor of national standars. but as a lo-
cw phenomenon. Whatever offends the standards of
community is pornographic. It is not clear what
constitutes a community. It is probably not larger.
than a state. and, might even be as small as an

apartment building. This is insane. What you may_

see depends on where you live. So far. there is no
law preventing you from going to a more permis-
sive neighborhood for your entertainment. or from
moving permanently from the company of blue-
noses.

A later decision may clear this up.
’l‘o date there is no existing law to protect vis-
iting innocents from Peoria or Somerset from being
offended during visits to such sin capitals as New

York and Pittsburgh. The day cannot be far off.
‘ In the future, anyone planning to move will have

' to consider not only schools, transportation, shop-

ping, average pollution index and relative cost of

living in his prospective neighborhood, but also the ,

climate of literary and cinematic criticism. We
will smother in the details of life.

I do not mind appeals to by baser instincts.
My prurient interests enjoy being titillated. 1 dis-
like violence and poor taste. I differ from the forces

of repression in only one respect—I have no desire A

to exterminate war movies and soap operas. l pity
those who are addicted to them. but I grant their

» right to be so addicted. There is a more basic ob-

jection to community standards.

Could an exclusively Catholic neighborhood
find Protestant propaganda obscene?

Could an overwhelmingly Democrat city deter-
mine that the world “Nixon” was too dirty for pub-
lic use?

Until we have the answers. happy reading. lf
you can find something clean. Sor_ far The Pitt

in “Last of Sheila"

by M. C. PILECKI

The movie murder mystery. af-
ter a long 'affliction of pseudo-sus-
pense yarns and ho-hum police
routine adventures. is indeed not
dead. The whodunnit is alive and
well in a cerebral thriller entitled
The Last. of Sheila, now at the

' Squirrel Hill Theatre.

Sheila is a wormy call girl turn-
ed Hollywood columnist. who is
eliminated before the opening
credits in a hit and run "acci-
dept t?i" after a party. Her hus-
band. the slightly decadent pro-
ducer. Clinton (James Coburni.
is a -games-maniac in much the
same spirit as Laurence Olivier
in Sleuth.

The game he plays is just as
deadly as Olivier’s, with the star-
studded cast as pawns aboard his
yacht named—you guessed it —-
Slieila. It is intended to reveal the
damaging secrets of the players.

Since all were the guests at that
earlier party. one secret may be
of a hit and run accident.

And so it goes.

The plot is well-worked and
should be a delight to arm chair
detectives. All clues are given,
and even the expectable red her-
rings are transparent enough to
the very observant. The‘title it-
self is a tricky pun that reveals
“whodunnit,” but so intricately
that frustrated sleuths will go
screaming—after the mystery is
unta-ngled—-that itxwas all so ob-
vious.

Kudos go to veteran actor An-
thony Perkins and lyricist com-
poser Stephen Sondheim for Shei-
la, their first venture into the
screen writing business. ‘

As usual in a suspenseful mys-
tery. "the plots the thing." and

the rest is shot to hell. The char- V

acters are mere caricatures of
Hollywood figures (some more
recognizable than others). Co-
burn is his typical demonic
image; Richard Benjamin is
graceless as a witless writer.
with Joan Hackett wasted as his
wiltedwife.

Dyan "Cannon strains her role
as the bitchy, nymphomanic

agent; James Mason is testily
persuading as a has-been direc-
tor; Racquel Welch is perfect as
a bad actress; and Ian McShane
is ‘rather grating as Welch’s
greedy husband. .

Herbert Ross" direction is un-
even. and the acting flat. and the
story really unbelievable. Sheila
is an intriguing. fun revival of an
almost lost genre.

For those with more "intellec-
tual" tastes. John Huston's Fat
City is at the Shadyside Theatre.
It has been somewhat over rated.
and it is certainly not Huston‘s
best. But even his worst (which
Fat City is not) is better than
many.

.The story’ concerns one boxer
(Stacey Keach) going ‘downhill
rapidly from a pinnacle he never
really achieved and a young fight-
er (Jeff Brides) who is climbing
to the top of the heap. Fat City is
an interesting look at “success,”
and what happens to the guys who
just don’t make it.

The film does drag at times.
