An Editorial

Uncommon Dance

While We’re not too hot on this tradition stuff—it gets
rather stiﬂing at times-—there is one thing we’d like to see
become standard operating procedure around here. It’s the
Commons Room Ball, of course.

Since the idea of an annual dance in the Commons Room
was one of our projects, we naturally want to see it go over
in the best possible way. For‘this reason, we’ve been some-
what critical of the way the ﬁrst one, scheduled for June 8,
was set up. ‘

We’re still critical, but that doesn’t alter our conviction
that the Commons Room Ball can be one of the most cher-
ished of Pitt memories.‘ We see it as, next to commencement,
the last, best event of our life at the University.

It’s something that should attract all those seniors who,
during their four years here, have had neither the time,
ntioney, nor inclination to participate in other campus activ-
1 Ies. -

It will be expensive, that’s true. But the money laid
out for tickets, a tux or a formal gown constitutes an invest-
ment in ever-enriched memory for the seniors and in a grow-
ing and happy tradition for the school.

Remember, for a moment, your high school prom. It.
too, probably constituted a relatively large investment, yet

ebands in the nation for college

how many of us would exchange the memory for the cash?

From our viewpoint, the Commons Room Ball is cheap
at the price.

  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  

prom bookings, and Look maga-
zine has named it “The College
Band of the Year.” He will come
here from an engagement in Niag-
ara, N. Y., and right after the Com-
mons Room Ball will leave for
Youngstown, Ohio.

Featured with the Thornhill
band are blonde, curvacious
Christy Connors, and the Snow-
ﬂakes.

Soft lights will go with Thorn-
hill’s soft music. Commons Room
light will be dimmed, and waxed
floors, a public address system, and
special decorations will be used to
turn the great hall into a grand
ballroom.

The second ﬂoor ofthe Cathe-
dral will be opened for overhead
views of the ballroom through the
arches, and if tentative plans go
through, the Bigelow porch will
be converted into a roof—garden
style lounge, with tables and over-
head lanterns.

Ticket agents say that sales have
picked up after a lull during Fes-
tival week, and warn that students
planning to go to the dance, par-
ticularly senior men and women, ,.
should buy tickets early, as the
sale will be limited to 600.

Tickets for the first Commons
Roam Ball are $4.50 at the Student
Desk or from ticket agents.

Colleges Conform,
‘Times’ Scribe Says

By GENE WEINSTEIN
Staﬁ Reporter

(First of a series)

“A subtle creeping paralysis of freedom of thought and
speech is attacking college campuses in many parts of the
country, limiting both students and faculty in the area tra-
ditionally reserved for the free exploration of knowledge

and truth.”

This was the conclusion reached
by the New York Times’ Kalman
Seigel after a study of 72 major
colleges in the U. S.

The survey, according to the
Times, showed many students
and faculty were “wary and fglt
varying degrees of inhibition
about speaking out on controver-
sial issues, discussing unpopular
concepts and participating in stu-
dent political activity . . . ”

Many Student Fears
Students, stated the
were fearful of:

social disapproval:

a. “pink” or Communist la-
bel;

criticism by regents, legis-
latures, and friends;

rejection for enrollment in
graduate schools;

the spotlight of investiga-
tion by government and pri-
vate industry for post-gradu-
ate employment and service
with the armed forces.

Much of the apathy towards
current affairs, declared some
educators,-was the result of “the
pressures generated by Sen. Jo-
seph McCarthy of Wisconsin.”

Free Discussion Curbed

Other leading educators, con-

tinued the Times, charged that the

Times,

' increasing tendency to avoid free

inquiry and the discussion of “hot”
issues has_“struck a body blow
at the American educational pro-
cess, one of democracy’s most po-
tent weapons . . ”

Students, noted these edu-
cators, were afraid to embrace
liberal or humanitarian causes
for fear of later retaliation
and association with the “red"
or radical label.

The president of the Bryn
Mawr Undergraduate Association
told the New York paper: “Stu-
dents have become increasingly
aware of the restrictions on free-
dom imposed by the loyalty oath,
the recent investigations, the la-
beling of subversive organizations,
and the University of California

‘ case.”

History Fraternity

Names President
John W. Huston, graduate as-

sistant in history has been install- t

ed president of the Pitt chapter of
Phi Alpha Theta, national histor-
ical fraternity. ’

Also installed were Ruth W.
Schuster for her third term as
secretary-treasurer; Gloria Hertz
as recording secretary; Charles
Harrison, assistant recording sec-
retary; Harry Hadden, historian
and press representative; Robert
Carlson, keeper of records; and
Dr. William H. Dusenberry, spon-
sor for the coming year.

UN Flag Plan
Bagged Down
Until Fall

Pitt won’t have a United
Nations ﬂag before next se-
mester.

Student Federalists here
who planned to purchase a United
Nations ﬂag for the Commons
Room have shelved the idea until
next semester, according to John
Blank, president.

He reported that because

an administration tie—up has L
snarled the plan, it will be
too late this semester to start
preparations, even if an ap-
proval does come through
from the chancellor’s office.

According to Blank, one of the
difficulties is uncertainty whether
the ﬂag will be hung in the Com-
mons Room. _

Blank said that the dean of
women’s office had sent his letter
concerning the ﬂag to the chan-
cellor’s office with an approval
on it. .

The chancellor’s oﬁice reported,
however, that it has not received
the letter yet.

Playwright Workshop

By IRENE ROZAKIS
Staﬁ Reporter ‘
Doby—Boy, an original one-act play by a Pitt senior will

'\

The show is free to the public. The play’s author, Les

Les Goranofsky, is alwriting ma-6

jor in the College.

Author A Veteran

Goranofsky, a veteran, has a

Virginia.

Doby—Boy is about a man who

rest of the world. His blindness
gives him a new perspective on
life. ’

Woods, an education major.

"Atlantic’ Prize Essa
Inspired byGrandparen - 

John Spanos, ﬁrst prize winner of the Atlantic Monthlgjig

   

 

essay contest says that he would like to be a writer, but on: «

if he has something to say.

Apparently the judges of the Atlantic's contest decided

  

for they named his Icaria as top
essay over 241 other entries from
100 American colleges.

Spanos says that his winning pa-
per was prompted by his grand-
mother’s tales of her native land.

Ever since he was a little boy he
has been listening to her stories of
Icaria, a Greek island off the coast
of Asia Minor. The island and its
people became as familiar and
vivid to him as his own neighbor-
hood and family.

Thus when Spanos was as-
signed an essay for his writ-
ing class this year, he had lit-
.tle trouble choosing a subject.
He created the Icaria he had
come to know so well.

A 22-year-old senior in the col-
lege, Spanos expressed an inter-
est in teaching and thinks he might
enter that ﬁeld.

State Defeats

After closing the regular
track season with a 72-59 loss
to Penn State Saturday at
the Stadium, the Pitt thin-
clads are now warming up
for the IC4A’s in New York

The loss to Penn State evened
up Pitt’s record at 2-2. State
pulled ahead in the third event;
and, overcoming reverses in the
ﬁeld events with strong showings
on, the cinder track, they retained
the lead throughout.

Scoring ﬁrst places in every
track event except the 880 and
the low hurdles, Penn State
amassed 51 points to Pitt’s 26 .in
running events. In the ﬁeld the
Panthers held a 33-21 edge.

Pitt Sweeps Discus

The outcome of the meet was
not decided until the thirteenth
event, when, leading 57-51, the
Nittanies scored a clean sweep in
the two mile run.

In this event State’s famed dis-
tance men, Bill and Don Ashen-
felter and John St. Clair, lined up
just before the finish-line and
broke the tape together for a
three-way tie.

Pitt sweeps in the discus and
the broad jump prevented a

ond straight sweep for Pitt’s dis-
cus team of Bob Arthurs, Tom

The SAE walked away with a

Schirnmel was ably supported in
