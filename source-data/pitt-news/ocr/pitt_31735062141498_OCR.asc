Rush Prog This Morning

 

Fewer Formal Affairs Being
Planned by Houses;
Enforce All Rules -

“Fraternities have come to the
natural conclusion that a whirlwind of
social events is not the best sort of
rushing procedure,” -announced Theo-
-dore W. Biddle, assistant to the dean
of men, this morning as 19 fraternities

launched a.’ nine-day program of rush-,
ingevents which will affect 500 fresh-
men and transfer students. Starting
at 8:30 o’clock this morning, official
rushing season will close at 2 o’clock
Sunday morning, October 16. Seven-
teen social fraternities and two. pro-
fessional business fraternities will
take part in the rushing period.
Stating that -after a longexperience
with various "types of rushing events,
fraternities have found that dances and
similar events la~ck much of the in-
timate spirit of a fraternity, Mr. Bid-
dle _said that fewer formal dance af-

fairs will be held this year than ever -

before. “A group can get to know a—
fellow’s real self better by taking him
to a theater party or to dinner than
by any other way,” said Mr. Biddle.
Although lower scholastic standards
are required forpledging this year,
fraternities Will rush more dis-crimin;
ately than in previous years, Mr. Bid-
dle believes. Most of the larger events
will be held over the two week-ends
while most of the week days will be
used for smokers, theater parties and
dinners. ‘Open house will be held at
the fraternities, on Sunday, October 9.

After the closing of the rushing sea-
son, the silence or bidding’ period will
extend until 5 o’clock Friday after-
noon, October 21, at which time the
fraternities will take their bids to the
ofﬁce of Mr, Biddle. Freshmenwho
have been tapped will be called to
confer with Mr. Biddle concerning
fraternity matters. All invitations to
pledge to a fraternity must come
through the o-fﬂce of the Dean of Men
and no invitation may be issued other-
wise.

Rules governing illegal rushing and
scholastic standing will be rigidly en-
forced this year, according to the of-
ﬁce of the Dean of Men. Fines and
suspension will be the penalty for in-
fraction of any of the rushing rules.

8,461 Enroll
At University

Registration Reaches 89.8
Per Cent 1931 Total

Contrary to expectations of a mark-
ed decrease in University enrollment,
ﬁgures compiled and released this
week by Beglistrar Quick shows. to-
tal of 8,461 students enrolled in all
schools of the University, or 89.8 per
cent of '-last year’s ﬁgures.

The decrease of approximately ten
per cent in total enrollment is at-
tributed, in part, to the introduction
of advanced entrance requirements
for freshmen.

Registration in all schools was be-
ing continued this week, indicating
the possibility of an increase before a
ﬁnal compilation of ﬁgures ismade by
the oﬁice of the registrar-

The total enrollment for undergrad-
uate freshmen as of Monday, October
3, reached 991, or 83.7 per cent of last
year’s total on the-same day.

Upperclassman enrollment, in all
the undergraduate schools on Monday
totaled.2,740, or 93.5 per cent of last
year’s total. i

Percentages of last year’s total for
theindividual schools variedfrom a
lowly 59.0 per cent in the School of
Pharmacy to an impressive 114.7 per
cent in the Graduate School, the latter
an increase of 14.6 per cent over the
1931-32 ﬁgure. ~

The frequentwarning that the pro-
fessions are overcrowded seems to
have had litt‘l_e_effect on incoming law
students, the enrollment inlthe Law
School having held up to 98.5 per cent
of the ﬁgure for the same day last
year. t V

Medicine followed closely with an
enrollment percentage of 96.0 percent,
while the College and Education held
up with a joint registration that was
93.0'per cent of the total for last year.

Business Administration entered
the upper tenth with an enrollment of
91.1 per cent of the previous year’s
ﬁgures.’ Comparative enrollment for
the other schools and classes of the
University were as follows: off
campus Centers, 86.7 per cent; Dental
School, 83.5 per cent; School. of Engi-
neering, 83.1 per cent; Downtown

University‘ Mourns Phar.-_
macy Registrar-Treasurer

Funeral services were to be held
this afternoon for Carl Saalbach, reg-
istrarlandtreasurer of the School-of
Pharmacy, who succumbed to a heart
attack in his office Tuesday after-
noon, ,

A graduate of the School of Phar-
macy in the class of 18'97=, Saalbach
had been actively connected with the
University for the past 23 -years. He
became treasurer of the Pharmacy
School in 1909,- and served in that ca-
pacity hntil 1923, when he assumed
the additional duties of the office of
registrar.

The registrar was born in Pittsburgh
in 1877, where he resided. throughout
the years of his life. At_ the time of
hi-s death, he was a warden of the
Smithﬁeld Congregational church. His
passing came as a blow to both friends
and family.

Dean C. Leonard 0.’Connell of the
Pharmacy School expressed the feel-
ing of his associates on the death of
the registrar. He said:

V “The entire staff was inexpre-ssibly
shocked at the sudden passing of their
colleague and friend, M_r. Carl Saal-
bach," The‘col1ege,.has lost a, faithful
Worker and the -staff has lost a good
friend.” ‘ - .

Saalbach is’ survived by his widow,
one son, ‘Robert Palmer Saalbach, a
junior in .the College of the .Univer-
sity, and two brothers. Services are
to be held at-his home-, 4319 Murray
avenue. «

Twenty-ﬁve Cwens are hoping and

, praying for sunshine tomorrow. For

several days they’ve ‘been glancing
suspiciously at the sky and at the
sight of a. cloud low -on the horizon

they put their heads together to de-
cide whetherit is a sign of - rain, or
merely a tornado. You’re wrong! It
isn't because the Cwens think Du-

on a wet ﬁeld; it's. not because they
are worrying about the thousands of
Pittsburghers who will‘ have to sit in
an uncovefed stadium; it’s not even
because they have new fall hats. Its
just for the simple reason that their
new red la-ckets have come, and the
Cwens are eager to show them at the
game tomorrow. The jackets are of
lipstick suede cloth.

The -Cwen uniforms now consist of
the red jackets and gray jumpers with
white blouses besides .the traditional
gray Cwen cap_with the red feather.
The jumpers, were made by the mem-
bers from the same pattern used by
this year's ,Tech Cwens, who "are wear-
ing red skirts and grey jackets. The
caps have been handed down from for-
mer years.

A four-page pamphlet has been print-
ed“ containing a list of the twenty-ﬁve

Although radically changed from
last year’s campaign, the membership
drive this year will continue the per-
sonal solicitation of members after
the social has been held. A small "com-
mittee of picked Y members will ap-
proach a selected group of students
and invite them to membership. This
list will be drawn up by the chairman
of the campaign on the day afterpthe

The -Alarm Clock’ Was shelved When Wimpy, 1>o.u1's
Mascot, Game to Live at the House

 

.The Panther has a new mascot in the form of a six-month-old

“bulldog, tagged VVimpy. He "arrived last Saturday after the ﬁrst
half of the Pitt-VVest Virginia footballvgame.

The dog was pre-

sented to “Bulldog” Reider, captain of the Pitt team, by Richard
Beddow on behalf of the medical department of that school.

As soon as the dog was brought over. to the Pitt bench, the
entire squad crowded around and began to play with their new toy.

After the third quarter had -started¢

even Jock Suther1and’s attention was
diverted! from the game for a few min-

utes by the newly adopted mascot.

Now that Reider has gotten the dog
as far as Pittsburgh he wants to take
him to his home in New Castle, but
his room mates won’t_let Wimpy go.
Cutri claims the dog's even better than

an alarm clock when it comes to wak- _

ing people. Wimpy spent the ﬁrst
morning in the football players’ home
on Forbes street; he rose bright and
early and woke his master with a
nice gentle nip on the lobe of his left
ear. Of late Wimpy even insists on
sleeping with Reider.

Although Frankie Walton, a tackle
on the -squad, is Wimpy’s ofﬁcial care-
taker, both “Fats” Heller and Paul
Cuba, who make u-p the rest of the
quintet that room together, look out
for him. ‘Mrs-. Williamson, the land-
lady, insists‘ that she be allowed to
arrange his diet; and so three times
each day she takes Wimpy to the
kitchen to " supervise his lapping and
chewing. .. . '

Captain Reider says that Wimpy will
accompany the team on all trips as
his personal mascot. ‘ ' _

University Secures
Golf Professional
To Teach Here

of the University has secured the
services of Mr. Andrew Patrick to
give golf instructions to students who
wish to learn or improve their game.
Mr. Patrick, a native Pittsburgher,
had been the golf professional at the
St. Claire golf course of the Belmont
country club previous to his accept-
ance of the position here. He is the
holder of the course record at the
Union country club of Dover, Ohio,
having made a. low score of 66 strokes
for eighteen holes.

Mr. .Patrick will give group lessons
free of charge to students. taking phy-
sical education in weekly gym classes.
The men's classes will be held the
fourth, ﬁfth and sixth periods on
Tuesdays, and the women’s classes
-will be held during the fourth and
ﬁfth periods on Mondays and Wed-
All the lessons will be
given in either the gymnasium or the

ing nets are put up. ,

Any faculty member or student may
have lessons in groups of ten at
twenty-ﬁve cents per person per hour,
or private, for one dollar per, half
hour. There is -still time to sign up

Gymnasium offices. Anyone interested
should see: either Mr. Patrick, Mr.
John B. Dambach or Mrs. Steven S.

25 swimmers
Open Training

Veterans, Freshmen Do Light
Workout at Trees Gym Pool —

 

When 25 swimmers report to the
ﬁrst call for candidates ’ any" coach
«should be satisﬁed, but when you con-
sider that the coach will be doing his
best to maintain an unbroken string
of victories in dual meets, the amount
does. not seem so great.

However Coach -Corr had nothing to
be -sorry for when the initial con-
tingent arrived at the 0 Trees Gym
pool. Many of last year’s' veterans
were back to answer the. roll call.
‘Led by Capt. Herman Adlersberg, the
varsity squad went through a light
workout, consisting of a few dashes,
relays and some long distance swim-
ming. Denny, Carik, Davies and Joe
Schmieler, all veterans; of last year,
looked good in the light workouts.

The freshman squad worked out with
the varsity, swimming against them
in many cases. -Geo-rge Lee, freshman
coach, expressed surprise at the ma-
terial and good form shown by the
frosh splashers. It .is'hard to judge
freshman prospects in the ﬁrst Week,
but from all apearances Coach Lee
has little to worry about.

Both- squads will gradually be
given harder daily assignments, and
it is_ expected that. a full practice
session will‘ be in order next week.

1, ODAY a new publicationmakes its appearance on the University campus.
‘  The selection of the PITT NEWS as the name for the semi-weekly cam-
‘pus’ newspaper marks the realization of a project that has been talked about
and. dreamed of by undergraduatestaﬁs since the ‘day Frank C..SteWart
brought out the first Pitt Weekly in 1910. _

Choosing a name foran undergraduate-Pliblication, we have discovered,

_involves more than mere balloting on a number of possible choices.

We

have felt keenly theresponsibility of selecting the name under which fu-
ture issues of the oﬁicial student news organ will be published. Our choice
has been -made with the idea in mind that a newspaper is only. what its
policies and contents make it, and that superﬂuous names have no place
on any publication masthead. PITT NEWS, We think,’ will wear with the
‘years, until the time when some enterprising editor ﬁnds a way to add an-

other word——DAILY.

Debaters Plan
Early   Season

Invite Freshmen to Compete
in Program

 

Tentative plans for the extensive
schedule of intercollegiate and exten-
sion. debates will be announced" as
part of the program at the annual
Men"s' Debating Association smoker to’
be held next Tuesday evening at 8

"o’clock in the Activities Buil-ding. All

upperclassmen and freshmen inter-
ested in debating have been invited to
attend. Refreshments will be served.

The program will con-sist of a mock.
debate‘ by members of the association
and talks by John P. Bracken, man-
ager, and by W. M. Parrish and Rich-
ard Murphy, -coaches. Besides out-
lining the .season’s schedule, Bracken
will discuss plans fora proposed fresh-
man debating team. ‘Theorganization
of a freshman debating team,wi,11 not
mean that freshmen cannot take, part
in the‘ regularly scheduled intercolle-
giate debates, but that they will be
given greater opportunity in competi-
tion than heretofore. Formerly fresh-
men were forced to compete for posi-
tions on the yarsityteam but under

-the proposed plan, ' debates will be‘

scheduled specially for them.

Due toga decrease in the budget,‘ the
number of intercollegiate debates may
have to be cut, but _it is planned to
greatly increase the number-of ex-
tension debates in order to make up
for this deﬁciency.

Hovde, associate ‘professor of history,
in the first of this year's series of dis-
cussions held.‘ «Wednesday, sponsored
by_ the Inquiry Club.

Dr. Hovde spent the summer in
Europe and his talk, a resume of some
of the facts Which he discovered while
abroad, was called “What An Ameri-
can Learned in Europe.” ’

At the request of his audience Dr.

Hovde restricted his attention to the '

conditions of utilities and to public
and privateownership‘ inlNo.rway and
Sweden. Opening his talk with a dis-.
cussion of the amount and the im-
portance of the natural ‘resources in
these two countries, Dr. Hovde pro-
ceeded with a‘ description of the at-
tempt of foreign capitalists to gain
control of some,-of the important in-
dustries.‘ ’

“In Norway concession laws were
passed in 1909, which almost -_com-
pletely solved -the problem of public
and private -ownership of industries.
These concession laws provide that a

company wishing to develop water
power must obtain a concession from
the -state, if the enterprise is abovea
certain size; that restrictions on for-
eign capital is greater than _those on
domestic capital and that, at the end
of 45 years of private management,
the enterprise will revert to thevstate,
unless the’ state decides otherwise.
“Every electric power- company in
Norway must furnish current to» the

consumer of the community in which is

the company is located at rates pro-
scribed by the state,” Dr. Hovde de-
clared.

“In Sweden the threat of vigorous
competition by the publicly owned
companies keeps the rates of the
private companies down,” the speaker
stated. _ .- -

.Norway and Sweden are but little
troubled by graft because of the high

‘salaries’ andthe high social position

adhering to the Phblic employees, Dr.
Hlovde pointed out in conclusion.

The next meeting of the Inquiry
Club will take place next Wednesday
when Ben H, Spence, Washington cor-
respondent of the Toronto Star, ‘will
deliver a -talk on “Canada's Liquor
“System.” ‘
