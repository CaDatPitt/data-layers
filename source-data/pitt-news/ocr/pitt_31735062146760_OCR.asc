STUDENTS _ MUST

The work of raising the guarantee
fund for the “Oyvl” Board is on in
earnest. $1200.00 must be secured by
December 15, before the issueof the
publication can be assured. This neces-
sitates a ready response from the stu-
dent body.

As.‘ explained in these columns last
week, the same plan of raising the
mone-y will be followed out by this
year's board. Every junior is assessed
ﬁve dollars, the payment of which is
compulsory. Although this idea is
pretty generally understood, there are
some who still believe thatxthey can
evade this obligation. For this pe-

cuniary" consideration, they receive as

free copy of the book, whoh contains
an individual picture and writeup.

A The remainder of the money is se-
cured through subscriptions: from the
seniors and underclassmen at two dol-
lars each,‘ one dollar of which is paid

,_ now, the remainder when the book
M come.s out. 5 This not only provides

funds, but also is indicative of the cir-
culationof the book. Only the number
of books will be printed as called for
by the subscriptions, soif you want a
book, subscribe now so that you will

not be disappointed in youreifort to

obtain a copy when itappearsin the
spring. Heretofore, there has always
been a demand for the book after the
edition has been sold, and Manager
Arther does not want anyone to be dis-
appointed in the spring. So subscribe
at once, by paying one dollar to the
manager in your department. _
The managers‘ in the various depart-
ments arer: , , _‘ -
. W. C. Arther Economics; Thomas
Pharmacy; G. M.
Sykes, Engineering; - Earl J e'ss_up,
Chemistry; Miss M. Louise Moye, Col-
lege; .M«iss Edith Matthews, Educa-

tion;————Frederick, Medical; J. A. ,.Groh, _

Mines; George Megah.an, Dental.
These men will be assisted by stu-
dents in the three other classes, so you

should not be missed.

V. A. Jevon,"19, has preparedsev-
eral sketches which will indica'te the

progress of the campaign from day to A

day. A clock will also be used to show
the amount raised from time to time.

The editorial staff is hard at work
gathering‘ the material which‘ will make
up the book. In a few -days informa-
tionwcards will be distributed which
will be ﬁlled out and returned, as soon

as possible-, so that the compilation 3

of such information will not be re-
tarded. '

1 A Good Sum to Senate and Sopho-
mofe Class. '

With $125.00 as the property of the
Student Senate donated by the trus-
tees and faculty of the _ University,
Pitt’s governing body started off with
renewed -energy this morning paying.
off all debts incurred throughout the
year..  .

A large part of the money collected
from the freshman caps as the proﬁt
of the bookstore will be handed over

which aggregates to $42.54. The
sophomore class will realize but $21.54
of the amount collected from the Gold
and Blue headgears. ‘

A petition was thenread asking that
the Student Senate allow a new soro-
rity to be organized on the campus.
Discussion arose as to whether the
Senate had the power to grant such
a petition. After it was discovered.
that the sororites at Pitt. had’ a Pan-.
Hellenic council discussion was imme-
diately dropped. -

The following letter‘ was then read

from the Chancellor“ .. -
My Dear Mr.-States: . -
, The reports.I.have heard of the pa-
rade downtown yesterday are so uni-
formly commendatory that I wish to
congratulate the Senate, and through
the Senate the student" body upon its
success.‘ I shall not be in the city on
Friday, and therefore shall, not have
opportunity to give expression of this.
sentiment personally. ’

I have spoken to several eyewit-
nesses, and at a meeting yesterday
evening several men who saw the pa-
rade commented favorably upon it. I
therefore feel that i1;.was' really a
great success. As »the_ body left the
'University in the morning,.I‘ had adie-
tinct feeling of disappointment that it
seemed to comprise so few of our stu-
dents. I am told, however, 1; at this
number was augmented con nually,
and thatperhaps one thousand of them
were in the parade in the downtown
district. I and quite pleased with the
whole affair.

With good wishes, I am,

Sincerely yours-, ' , O
S.lB. McCormick.

 an
economic ‘point of view, and discussed
the condition] of:a.1l the warring coun-
tries. Mr. Spargo said in part: ‘

-ially affected" by the outcome of the
war. We as Americans should oﬂ-set
the cry for preparedness.‘ Ifthe Teu-

present conﬂict, preparedness will be
necessary but if they are defeated, a

Be,’ re the end of the war men of large

Germany will be paying 50 "percent of
their incomes’ to the government. The
effect of the war will weaken the

-Mr. Spargo di.s.cussed~ the, position
of the peasants in Russia at the pres-
ent time -and what their position will
be at‘ the end of the war if Russia is
defeated. He said that one of the

ness is _because she has unlimited "nat-
ural resources but lacks a ready ac-
cessible’ highway .to the markets. If
Russia had -an open highw-aﬂlto the

Pitt Sororities Unite in Common
Activities.
“RUSHING” RULES FORMED

Miss e Helen Donaldson First
President of Con£erence——Two
Reprelsentatives From Each So-
rority. » . ' '

A Pan-Hellenic conference, with full
powers‘ of jurisdiction and absolute
authority over all inter»-sorority rela-
tions has been organized by the three
sororities" now existing at the Univer-
sity--the Zeta Tau Alpha, formerly
‘C. I. C, the Pi Theta Nu and the Delta
Omicron. _ A ” e

For some time tentative arrange-
ments have been onfoot for the or-.
ganization of some central tribunal,
which would regulate an-d systematize
the common activities of the Univer-
sity sororities, and the ﬁnal culmina-
tion of these plans has been reached
inthe formation of the Pan.-‘Hellenic
Board ‘last Monday morning. ‘

The officers of this board are as fol-
lows: President, Miss Helen Donald-
son, Zeta Tau Alpha; vice president,
Miss Helen Humphrey,’ Delta Omi-
cron; secretary, Miss Louise Culley,
Pi Theta Nu. » h ‘r

The board is composed of six mem-

bers, two representatives being ad-

mitted from each sorority in the con-
ference. The boand for the coming"
years consists of the following mem-

, Zeta. Tau Alpha—-Miss Helen Don-.
aldson, Miss Betty. Dun.

, Pi Theta  7-Miss Louise -Culley,
      ”‘
F , Delta O_m‘i,cr.on_—-‘-Miss Elsie Harker,
Miss Helen“ Humphr  , ’

.The‘faculty advise is Miss McLain,
instructor. in house economics in the
School of Education. ,

This board, appointed each year by
the respective sororities, will meet
every‘ Monday afternoon in State
Hall and all questions relative to in-
ter-sorority activities or disputeswill
be considered‘ and deﬁnitely decided.
‘Stringent laws have already been out-
lined by the conference fo-r the regu-
lation and standardizing of pledging
and rushing customs. Some» of the

, negulations _ and restrictions V already

enacted by theboardare as follows:

No invitation may be issued’ to any
-girl‘ to join any sorority before the
end of the ﬁrst term of the school
F499-1% ' « . ' . ' *

/Any sorority formed at‘ any time in
the future must ﬁristfapply for admit-
tance to the Pan-Hellenic conference
and agree to abide by all the\regula-
tions of that board, before gaining
official recognition in matters pertain-.
ing to the University. ' ‘

‘Of the, three sororities constituting
the Pan-Hellenic conference the Zeta
Tau Alpha is “at present the only na-
tional, being founded in the fall of 1914
was the C., I. C. Club, and installed
two weeks ago into thefnational ranks.
The Pi, Theta Nu Sororrlty-was, found-
ed in 1908‘, gained admittance into

rorityduring the ‘past summer, and
will beinstalled during the ﬂrst week
in December- The Delta Omicron So-

=rority,was- founded in the spring of
V 1914. .

This action of. the Pitt sororitiesl‘
has been ‘under contemplation‘ for
some time and its ﬁnal a.ccom-pli:sh-
-ment is expected by the members of
the conference and the University gen-
erally to take a decisive step toward
unifying and crystallizing the actions
and ‘customs of these‘ oirganizations
in the future. By this common‘ and
voluntary action, it is expected that
all causes for dissenion may be
eradicated. ’ ’ '

STUDENTS HEAR
  ; “CURRENT TOPICS”

Miss Katherine Locke addressed the
weekly assembly last Friday morning
on “Current Topics.”

The main topics of her lecture were
expressed in connection with the ten-
dencies toward conservation of re-
sources and aspects of the European
war.

“Two years ago the word ‘conser-
vation’ became very popular in the
United States,” said Miss Locke- “We
conserved our natural resources and
human life. We practiced conserva-
tion everywhere. Genius and gifts of
art, however, have not been conser-
vated_ These ﬁelds 'of advancement
alone have been neglected. ’

“A year ago another word became
very prominent.‘ This word isltalian,

ly b ‘an "enemy. ‘Irrepenta’ has been

’ seen and . heard everywhere for the‘,

past. 3' ,

A VconsiderationVo:f the economic ef-
fect of the war on the United States
must be divided into/periods of ‘time,
marked ‘roughly by thesigning of the
treatyof peace. There are three very
‘deﬁnite results apparent during the

isolation . it has given the United
States Vas"tVheT most ‘powerful of the

-civilization and is still abroad in the
world. But, taking every circumstance
into! consVid.eration, we refuse to sign
a. petition, which was circulate“dTV some
time ago,‘ asking Congress to take im-
mediate/Tsteps for the abolition of the
munitions I evil.  We stand with Secre-

New SEATS rennin
emu MEN AT GAMES

. Atthe big football games,the ath-
letic management has been confront-

 

football letter men who have the nat-
ural desire to sit on the bench on the
sidelines with the ‘team. It has been
impossible to provide room for all who
wanted these and the Coach can get
better work out of his men it he has
them entirely to himself on the bench.
He» wants the boys to have their mind
.-on the game every minute and to not

know his carefully worked out plan.
"Furthermore, the demand has been so
great at times that some of the play-
ers, and even the ‘Coaches, have had
trouble ﬁnding. a seat. L r - 
Wishing to encourage the old letter

get near to the thick of the fray, ar-
rangements have been made to have
several benches ‘located back of the
players bench for the use of the: Foot-
ball Letter men. The players bench
will be for the. use ofthe coach and
his assistants, the players, the ath-
letic management and for the mem-
bers of thefootball committee only.
The’ benches back of the players
bench are for theletter men. Letter
men who desire to sit on this. bench
should write the Graduate Manager
and he will see that they are'provid-
ed with proper LL adge. ‘ This same plan
is in effect at t e University of Penn-
sylvania and is a very popular one.
Franklin ﬁeld is of course better L t-
ed for working it than Forbes ﬁel ‘-is
but for the present, at least until the,
number of letter men grows too large
it is believed that-itcan be handled
satisfa-ct-orily.  A v ‘
The plan, will be effective with the
Penn State: game and -letter men are
urged to co-operate with the manage-
ment and not ‘insist on sitting on the

will be provided for them are equally
-as desirable. ‘ e H L ’

1912 Class “Memorial
Alm_os_t_ Completed

The 1912 Me’morial—-a flag pole
erected on the steps of State Hall-—--
has about been completed and plans
for the dedi-catory exercises are now
being ﬁgured on» by that c1tass.. It is
just possible that these exercises may
be deferred untilrnext June when the
class could ha"ve~a reunion. ‘As the
writer recalls, it is not their regular
reunion year but this would not neces-
sarily have to be! taken into considera-
tion. . ' 

The 1912; !Memorial is the ﬁrst on
the campus: other than the. class trees.
It is a handsome flag pole and is set
permanently with granite baseon the
State Hall steps. The whole arrange-
ment was approved by the -University
architects and is in keeping with -the
’arc‘htectural scheme of the lower
campus. The ﬂag pole and. base cost
in the neighborhood of $200,. we under-
stand, this fund being subscribed when
the class graduated. It was only re-
cently that through the activities of
the Class President, Louis W. Mc-
Intyre, that the Memorial idea was
developed and deﬁnite plans adopted.

BUYSGUIJTSHAVE  
 rm surromnis

Those who watched th'eBoy Scouts

 

"march on Forbes; ﬁeld before the Pitt-
Techl football game last Saturday,‘

had they scrutinized the crowd closely,
would have seen two well-known Pitt
alumni ajitively participating.

One of the men was .John'H. Nichol-

L son, Assoc. Engi-.’1885, who is one of
‘_th9 prime movers in the Boy Scout

Movement in Western Pennsylvania,

L and the other was P. W. Price ’99, who

is a -Scout Master. It was at .Mr.
.Price~’s suggestion that the gathering
of Boy Scouts was apranged and it
proved tobe one of the most popu-
lar moves of the season. There were

over 1000' ‘of the Scouts in line and

they enj-oyed the game "immensely.
The efforts of Mr. Nicholson in the
Scout movement are bringing about
a tremendous amount of good. accord-
ing to high oﬂicials of the organiza-
tion who spoke to the Alumni Secre-
tary at the game. As'Vice-President
of the National Tube Company and
exerting-wt_he.inﬂLuence of a . “big”
business man, Mr.” Nicholson has done
.a great work’ for the Scouts. Although
busy with his business interests, he
always has time to devote to the boys
an-d they all love and revere him for
it. . -\ , ’ . ’
Mr. Price is another enthusiastic
worker for the Scouts. He has been
active in getting alumni members i in
his home. town—OakL’mont—‘—recently
and -his efforts have been meeting wit
great success. L ~

Alumni are Asked to’   
  Sen_c_L(2ld Pictures.

The picture of the 1898 .Musical
-Clubs of W. U. P. furnished by R. C.
Johnson, ’99,_is bound to be very in-
teresting to the alumni of that time
and we hope to secure similar. pictures
from the “grads” which can be print-
ed in the Alumni Page‘. A number
have been promised and are on the
Way to us. L A’ ’

L If you have a. picture of an old foot-
ball, track, baseball, or any other ath-
letic team or of a. musical’cLlub before
or after. the time covered by Mr.
'John_son’s picture, send it along and’
“we will be gladlto use it. iT.h.e picture
willnot be soiled or diefaced and will
«be L returned I in «as, good "condition as
re.ceived.L ;If it is_bad1y' faded, it will
-be "impossible to use it, however,’ as
the engraver must have it good clear
print to get a satisfactory cut. ‘-

“ This picture “stunt” hasgiven the

 

7Secretary an idea which he hopes to-
work out: at some future alumni "gath-

ering. That is to make a collection

of all the old. photographs‘ relating to L.
the University--buildings, 'organiza- C

tions, clubs,’ fraternities, etc. and have
‘an exhibition of them. “Grads” ‘look-
ing over these old pictures will have

many pleasant memories awakened of

the days when they were in Lcolliege

I and were activeas. undergraduates in

the affairs of their Alma:M»ater. That
all t;h.e.se men have “made good” in
their business Iife- proves conclusively
our contention that the boy who is ac-

tive in student affairs and not afraid I

to wo-rk‘..at’ something othertlian what
might be termed... straight class room
work, has a hundred per -cent. better

chance to’ make. good that the fellow 1

The!‘ report that Ed. Henley was
playing with‘ an independent team in
Ohio was erroneous. Henley ,ha's~only
recently been discharged from the hos-
pital where he was having an oper-
ation on his eyes. The Hanley that
is playing now in the Buckeye statey
is “Coze” I-Ianley, a brother of last‘

Syracuse certainly sent Colgate’s
hopes for championship ~ recognition,
glimmering. This ‘eliminated one con-
tender for. the premier honors of the
intercollegiate gridiron. CoArne1l’s
weakness against Washington and Lee
was a hard blow to their claim for
honors. Any team that allows an op-
ponent to score three touchdowns
against themacan hardly boast of their
defensive strength. Both the offensive
and the defensive power of a "team
must, be taken into consideration in
reckoning -up the ﬁnal stand-in-g.

 

Hastings, ‘Soppitt, Herron and: Peck
are being mentioned by many of the
sporting scribes and football critics
of the East,'for positions on the my-
thical All-American eleven. All these
men‘ are experts at their positions and
we feel that if more of the so-called

lic communication on Saturday even-
‘I..i-;11e%”» November 13th, at 7:30. The
many testimonials which the Uni-

opreation of the wireless plant has
been very encouraging and indicates
that the wireless work of the Uni-

alumni affairs. It may not be -gen-
erally known that the $2.00 received
by the Association for membership——
withthe 750 members we have now—-
is not suﬂicient to ﬁnance our alumni
affairs along the broad lines which are
proposed. Seventy-ﬁve cents of every
$2.00 received is paid the PITT
’W%{KLY management for sending
the paper to the alumni, leaving $1.25
for running the Association. Eight
loyal alumni are contributing toward
the salary of the Alumni Secretary,
which helps take care of that expense.
Oﬂ‘ice expenses and for Association

ance and at the present time the Asso-
ciation is badly in need of money. It

‘Now as to their relation to the alumni
ticket» sale and some of the suggest-
ions which have been made, designed
to solve the alumni ﬁnancial problem
and to give the proper advantage in
the ticket distribution to tho.se who
are the best supporters of alumni
affairs.

One suggestion is THAT THE AD-
VANCE MAIL ORDER SALE BE
CONFINED TO MEMBERS OF THE
GENERAL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION
ONLY. If this were done, the mem-
bershipshould be increased at least
500 and possibly 1,000 in a year. For
the $2.00 dues paid, the alumni would
get THE WEEKLY free and get ﬁrst
choice at the alumni ticket sale. Of
course, after the advance sale, non-
members could get tickets in the usual
"way. The membersA would get ﬁrst
choice, however.A » . A ‘ - -

Another suggestion was that there
should be an added step in this con-
nection. That is, A SYSTEM OF
CONTRIBUTING M‘EMBE.RS TO ~‘ BE
ADOPTED, WHEREBY ALL ALUMNI

FIXED SUM FOR ALUMNI DUES
‘WHICH WOULD GIVE THEM FIRST

is in effect, we understand, at several
of the larger Eastern universities. If

we would haver$1,000 toward general
alumni expenses at the outset, as
against the $200Areceived—at the $2.00
rate. These contributing members to
be restricted, of course, to a certain
number of tickets, say not over. 10.
As it is extremely likely. that ‘the
matter will be brought up for final dis-
position at the next meeting of Alumni
Council, the Secretary will welcome
suggestions from the ‘:grad.s.”l The
suggestions above have their good’ and

bad points, with the advantage in fa-

vor of the good ones, it seems. Let-
ters giving your views will be printed
on this page and it—is hoped that a
general discussion willye entered into.

Secretary has been asked td start‘tak-

and .‘‘Marriage,’’ by Dr. Douglass Hyde

and translated by Lady Gregory, are

the two plays selected by the Pitt
Players to belproduced in the early
part of January.

The plans of the organization are
rapidly taking shape. iThe coach is

trying out the-candidates with -the idea

of selecting the best ones for the re-
spective parts. However, 1 he thinks
that the best talent in the school has
not responded to the call for candi-
dates._ The cast has not been selected
yet and will not be for two for three
weeks. More ‘candidates are needed,
and eachwwill be given an equal
chance‘. . . A

The Pitt Players is a modern drama-
tic club, which is an experiment in new
style production, the aim -of which is
to present drama in modern style. A

The organization has been invited
to cooperate with the Pittsburgh"
branch of the Drama League of Amer-
ica inrits Shakespearean celebration

Y. M. C. A.

The week of prayer for colleges and
universities was inaugurated at Pitt
at the regular meeting of the Y. M. GA.
A. ‘last Monday morning in Thaw ‘Hall,
with President Stark presiding.

In the absence of Dr. E. H. Ward,
who was scheduled to‘ speak, Secre-
tary G. M. Kirk spoke on the value of
prayer in our every day life. He
brought out the wonderful potential-
ities of prayer, which may beof one
of two kinds: thanksgiving and inter-

’ cession. Mr. Kirk outlined several of

the blessings for which we ought to
be thankful, such thanks to be offered
in prayer; and also showed how we
can pray for intercession in the things
which we desire to attain.

Several voluntary prayers ,- were of-
fered. _ by those present for the diffi-
culties which prevail at this institu-
.tion, for the temptations that are pres-

use of prayer for world happiness.

cello solo by Joseph Replogle, acco-m-
panied by W. T. Canan.
