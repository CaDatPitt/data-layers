Tradition at Pitt, is there any?

Students, chancel/or, administrators, staff give their opinions on Pitt tradition

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

On this site in I 787 stood a log schoolhoitse — the
ﬁrst home of the University of Pittsburgh.

On the site of that historical plaque now stands a

' downtown parking garage, across the street from a

hobby shop and an adult video store.

The log schoolhouse is long gone‘ from this colorful
block of the Boulevard of the Allies and the university
moved to Oakland to become a billion dollar academic
institution “at the leading edge of universities creatively
dealing with the rest of the world.”

One would think a place with such a successful histo-
ry would be full of customs handed down from one gen-
eration to the next, but does Pitt have any of the charac-
teristics which can be considered tradition? Or have
these customs been swept away after every generation
by the urban pace and the dynamic growth of a city
campus?‘

In a very unscientific survey, Pitt personalities from
the chancellor to students of all ages were challenged to
find Pitt traditions which have existed for the past two
centuries, two decades or two years. The search turned
up traditions ranging from university—sponsored formal
ceremonies to tI1e“traditiona1” partying on Thursday
nights to the outrageous lines at the bookstore.

Even though few people had the same answers about
Pitt tradition, all insisted that tradition is alive and well
at the University of Pittsburgh.

One of the most popular traditions is the October cele-
bration of Homecoming at Pitt, which the Alumni
Association calls “an opportunity for students to start
participating in a joy-‘filled tradition and for alumni to
stir the magic of the past.” ‘a

The Friday night activities, which include the recent
addition of a laser show on Bigelow Boulevard along
with fireworks and music, food and entertainment in the
William Pitt Union afterward, are a favorite of many

Pitt News File Photo
Homecoming is one of Pitt's most popular traditions.

current students.

“The fireworks and laser show is great,” student
Samantha Laskey said. “I like Homecoming because it
seems to bring the whole campus together.” I

The football game, which features the crowning of the
Homecoming king and queen, will pit the Panthers
against archrival West Virginia this year. '

“There are different things going on everyday of

Homecoming week and there are always more people at
the football game,” student Carrie Anderson said. “A lot
of people get involved.” I I

Another event mentioned by several people is Pitt’s
Lantern Night. In Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor’s
words, it’s the “tradition which honors the pursuit of
knowledge and truth, the strength of women supporting
women and the inspirational passing of leaming’s torch
to first-year students.”

Held during orientation, this year’s 75th Lantern
Night includes the traditional procession by first-year
females from the union to the Commons area of the
Cathedral of Learning where they are welcomed to Pitt
by the chancellor and other administrators.

“It is certainly a tradition because my mom did it
when she was a freshman at Pitt,” Anderson said. “I
liked it because it was something I shared with many of
the other females in my class.”

According to Assistant Director of Student Activities
Keny Daley, the lit candle symbolizes inspiration as the
women pursue academic endeavors at Pitt and repre-
sents the beginning of a way of life in search of knowl-
edge.

“It is a great opportunity for all freshmen women,”
she said. '

In a break from Pitt’s formal traditions, but yet of the
most popular mentioned by students, is the phenomenon
of “Thursday night out.” One visiting college student
may have best summed up this tradition last year when
he asked, “Doesn’t Pitt have Friday classes?” after wit-
nessing the crowded streets of Forbes Avenue on a
Thursday night.

“Bars are more crowded on Thursday than Friday or
Saturday,” student Mary Gerst said. She said one Pitt
tradition is freshmen learning to schedule around Friday

. classes. “After the first semester, they know not to have

class before 2 p.m.”
Senior Steve Goldberg said, “Thursday nights are
crazy around here. I think people are so eager for the

The Pitt News Interview: New Piﬂ Provost James Maher

(Editor’s Note: The following
interview with new Pitt Provost
James Maher was conducted by
News Editor Stephen
Kozarovich. Maher was selected
as the new provost in June fol-
lowing a I 0—month search.)

SK: What has surprised you
most about the provost position
after your first month in office?
JM: There hasn’t been any big
surprises. I’ve been busy meet-
ing the deans of all the schools
that report tothe provost office
and learning about the schools;
busy working on the university’s
planning exercise which was
reasonably far along before I
became provost and will be
completed this coming year.

SK: When I spoke with you ear-
lier this summer you said
you’ve always seen yourself as
a teacher and research scientist
ﬁrst. Are you going to miss the
classroom and the lab?

JM: Yes, I very much miss the
classroom. My graduate stu-
dents are still working in the lab
and conferring with me on
weekends, but it’s" interesting to
learn to work at being an admin-
istrator, but it’s also interesting
to teach and do research. So, it’s
a mixed blessing changing lives
in this way.

SK: How do you plan to stay in
touch with the concerns of the
faculty and students now that
you are no longer in the class-
room?

JM: Well, that’s going to take
some work. I hope to_ do it by
working at meeting faculty and
students, but it’s not something
that will happen without a con-
scious effort.

SK: You’ve spoken before
about moving Pitt to the fore-
front of state-related universi-
ties. What does this entail and
will it be more difficult than you
originally suspected?

JM: It’s certainly not easy.

American universities are all
under severe economic strain at
the moment and we’re no
exception. We’re a university
that traditionally has been very
frugally run, and as a result we
are not in as bad financial condi-
tion by any means as many, if
not most other, universities. On
the other hand, we are under the
strains of shortages of federal
funding, shortages of state fund-
ing, costs of higher inﬂation and
most of the things that we have
to purchase than in the general
economy. Those are putting
pressure on tuition, and we are
in a major construction phase
because of a great need to
upgrade facilities like our library,
and like some of our classroom
facilities, and all of those things
together put pressure on us to
think through very carefully
everything we spend money on,
But I’m very hopeful that we
will spend our money right and
better our position in the world
of American research universi-
ties during the next 10 years.
SK: You’ve also said you
noticed a lot of hostility from
the media and Congress, how
so?

JM: I think that there's a gener-
al assumption in the media and

maybe in the general public, and
that gets reflected in some of the
remarks that one hears from
public servants — that universi-
ties are insensitive to the effects
of tuition increases on their cus-
tomers. And I understand that
tuition increases are hard for our
students and their families to
absorb, but I think it would be
easier for students and their
families to tolerate and accept
tuition increases if the media
were a little bit better at report—
ing the reasons for the tuition
increases. Everybody wants the
person standing in the front of
the class to be an expert.
Everybody wants the library to
be good. Everybody wants the
right kind of computer facilities
to be available for the students.
Everybody wants the buildings
to be in good condition.
Everybody wants the university
to comply with all the modern
building code requirements.
Those are all important things
and those are all things that are
quite expensive. Many of the

economies that have been
achieved by American industry
during the last 10 years have
been economies by eliminating
high salary positions. The
remaining experts in industry.
however, have rather high
salaries and when the universi-
ties try to put someone with that
expertise in front of a classroom
they’ve got to to pay the going
rate. And the universities are
very much in the teaching busi-
ness —— be it freshmen under-
graduate teaching or be it super-
vising the research of very
advanced graduate students and
that teaching tends to be labor
intensive. And labor intensive
things that require highly trained
teachers are very expensive.

SK: In a survey last spring con-
ducted by a journalism class at
Pitt, they discovered 81 percent
of 300 students surveyed had
witnessed cheating at Pitt and 53
percent had personally cheated
at Pitt. Large classrooms and

lecture halls were factors in

a chance to grow intellectually or socially,” Maher said.

Common sense and learning about safety vital to safe Iiving

-By Jon Hayes

Staff Writer

Beginning a year of college
at any school can be both an
exciting and intimidating
experience.

And while Pitt is an urban
campus, with urban crime and
a sometimes not—so—street—
savvy student body, new and
old students need to make
themselves more aware of
Pitt’s safety features to feel
more comfortable living here,
according to Pitt’s Assistant
Director of Public Safety Gary
Moses.

Withou_t_ using common
sense or making an effort to
learn about campus safety, Pitt
can be as much a scary experi-
ence as dangerous, he said.

For Moses, he said common
sense is not walking alone at
night or leaving possessions
unattended.

The most prevalent crime at
Pitt is theft, he said. ‘

Most thefts occur because

the stolen article had either
been placed somewhere
thieves commonly look or
because it was left unattended,
according to Moses.

“Go to the bottom left—hand

person who has that desk is a

As Pitt’s student, faculty and
staff populations continue to
spill over into the Shadyside
and Squirrel Hill area, the
Department of Public Safety
will be expanding its service
even further, Moses said.

With 68 commissioned
police officers working five
different shifts, and sometimes
coordinating their patrols with
City of Pittsburgh Police,
Moses said his department can
handle the majority of prob-
lem,_s that could occur at Pitt.

However, Perry said the
greatest safety problem at Pitt
lies not with Public Safety’s

human or technical resources, .

but in a lack of communication
between Public Safety, the
media and students.

She said Public Safety and
The Pitt News need to do more
to increase student awareness
of violent crimes such as rape
and date rape.

“You hear it from the per-
son, but you don’t see it in the
paper. [The Pitt News] campus
police blotter is a joke. Who
cares that someone’s keys
were stolen,” Perry said.

Pitt sophomore Josh Muro
said he agreed that the
police blotter has been little
more than an amusing diver-
sion. -

“I used to read it every day
and I never saw anything that
was ever of any major con-
cern,” he said.

Public Safety posts a month-
ly Crimewatch bulletin in
campus buildings which
details the department’s crime
statistics.

Moses said he runs into
problems when students do not
report crime because pinpoint-
ing troubled areas becomes
more difficult.

“I want [students] to report
anything that occurs. If they
have $5 stolen I want them to
report that,” he said.

And in incidents of violent
crime, Moses said the depart-
ment’s number one priority is
pursuing assaults and rape to
the fullest extent.

But, Perry said Public Safety
needs to do more than publish
Crimewatch to heighten
awareness of sexual assault.

She said victims of date rape
may not report such incidents
to Public Safety because they
may believe there will be an
inadequate response.

“There is a feeling that
somewhere along the line the
ball is dropped,” she said.

Aside from Crimewatch.
Public Safety frequently gives
safety seminars. Within the
past year the department has
held 70 safety seminars.
Waters said. which are intend-
ed to inform students about
crime statistics and incidents

as well as give students an,

opportunity to express any
concerns.

“If any group of students get
together I’ll send people to
talk to them. You set the time
and you set the date and we
will have someone there for
you,” Waters said. a

On Internet, ”you can go anywhere you wont to go”

By Kathleen Scanlon
Staff Writer

One Thursday afternoon,
graduate student Patrick
O’Brien satin front of a com-
puter at the Pitt lab and leisure-
ly scrolled through the avenues
of the Internet.

O’Brien first visited a discus-
sion group whose participants
write responses to the articles
of syndicated columnist Dave
Barry. Then he got a free copy
of “Alice in Wonderland.”
Then he checked out the weath-
er in Chicago. Then he
described his academic adven-
tures of the week to a friend in
New York.

On the Internet “you can go
anywhere you want to go,”
according to Elizabeth
Mahoney, the head librarian at
Pitt’s School of Library and
Information Science.

A supemetwork of computer
networks around the world, the
Internet connects universities,
research organizations,
libraries, companies and gov-
ernment institutions. Pitt stu-
dents can now wade through
this giant pool of information,
using the computers in the
Computing and Information
Services’ labs.

-“The Internet is a very excit-
ing place,” said David Schatz,
the assistant to the director for
computing labs. “It offers so
much, the best way to learn
how to use it is to get out there
and play with it.” i

Perhaps the aspect of Internet
most familiar to students is
Telnet, which allows a user to
connect to another computer
system. A user can send elec-
tronic messages via Telnet.

“Have you -ever wanted to
send a message to the
President?” Schatz asked.

Telnet enables users to send
messages to any government
leader who has made their e-
mail address available to the
public, Schatz said.

Pitt junior Becky Hammond
uses Telnet to send messages to
fellow members of Phi Sigma
Pi, an honor fraternity on cam-
pus. All members are part of a
“distribution list.” So when she
sends one message out, it
reaches each member.

“Instead of sending a separate
message to each individual, I
can send one message to every-
one,” she said. “It’s a lot more
convenient.”

Students can also send mes-
sages to users of computer sys-
tems all over the world.

“I just sent one to Norway,”
said Mark Ioli, a physics major
at Pitt. Ioli has also used Telnet
to communicate with a friend in
Ohio and his brother at
Carnegie Mellon University.

“This fall, ‘I’ll use it a lot,” he
said. “It’s easier than calling
them.” ’

Communicating via Telnet
can bemore convenient than
using the phone, Schatz said,

because the receiver of your ‘

message does not have to be at
the computer when you send it.
The next time the person logs

on to the computer, the message
will be waiting for them. The
receiver or sender can also print
out any message.

Another feature of the
Internet, FTP (File Transfer
Protocol), allows a user to
transfer a file from one machine
to another.

A professor can
store course exercis-
es in a ﬁle on a com-
puter. Students can
FTP those exercises
to the computers
they are using, com-
plete the exercises,
then send it back to
the professor’s
machine. The pro-
fessor can grade the students’
work, then store it on the com-
puter where the students can
access their graded work to see
how they did.

“Have you ever heard of
Grolier’s Encyclopedia?”
Schatz said.

If you haven’t, don’t worry.
It’s on—line, so you can learn all

typed in a keyword search,

the screen. After Schatz clicked
into one of the articles, the full
text appeared on the screen.

“This is a tremendous
research tool,” he said.

Using the Gopher, a user can
tap into a plethora of reference
items, including the Oxford

English Dictionary. The
“Gutenberg Project” has even
transferred many classics into
electronic format so a Gopher
user can pull up on the screen
Shakespeare’s “Hamlet,” for
example, and print it out.

Why would you want to do
that?
“Sure, you can
 check out
Shakespeare from
the library, but you
can’t mark it up,”
O’Brien said. “If
you get a free
copy on the
Internet, you can
mark it up all you
i want.”

Plus, “it’s fun,” O’Brien said.

Information about academic
departments, events, courses
and programs at Pitt, as well as
info about community groups
and events constitute a small
fraction of a service called
Pittlnfo, accessible through the
Internet Gopher.

Nearby neighborhoods filled with plen

Oakland, contrary to popular belief, is
not an island with no way off. There are
many options for students without cars
to see the sights and search the sections
of Pittsburgh.

Sporting events, concerts, museums,
restaurants and shops spill over into the
different sections of the city.

Downtown

Whether it be an ice or roller hockey
game or an indoor soccer match at the
Civic Arena or a musical at the
Benedum Center or Heinz Hall,
Downtown is full of attractions.

“Pittsburgh’s compact Downtown is
truly remarkable,” said Todd Erkel,
associate director of communications for
the Greater Pittsburgh Convention and
Visitors Bureau.

“In one easily walkable 11 by 11 block

area, you’ll find eight of the world’s'

largest corporations, three of the nation’s
largest banks, three major  department
stores, a state park with a huge fountain,
a thriving cultural district, a wonderful
sampling of architecture, shops of every
description and the shortest, cleanest
free subway in America.”

The Point, the confluence of the
Monongahela, Allegheny and Ohio
rivers, is set off by a large fountain sur-
rounded by grass and trees.

For shoppers, Downtown is home to
Kaufmann’s, the new Lazarus, Saks
Fifth Avenue, the Arcade Shops at Fifth
Avenue Place, the shops of One Oxford
Center  well as many other shops and
boutiques.

Heinz Hall is featuring the Pittsburgh
Symphony and Symphony Pops this fall
as well as the Broadway series “Blood
Brothers” Oct. 11 through Oct. 16,
“Jelly’s Last Jam” Dec. 27 through Jan.
1 and “Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat” May 16
through May 21.

The Benedum Center’s Broadway
Series will feature “Hello, Dolly!” Sept.
13 through Sept. 18, “Tommy Tune’s
Grease” Nov. 29 through Dec. 4, “The
Sound of Music” March 14 through
March 19 and “Angels in America”
April 29 and 30. “The Nutcracker” will
also play at the Benedum Center at the
end of November and during December.

Neil Simon’s “Laughter on the 23rd

from Jan. 31 through Feb. 12.

Oakland, using the Port Authority
Transit —- Pittsburgh’s transportation
system —— catch any 61 or 71 series bus
from Fifth Avenue bus stops. The cost is
$1.25 one way.

North Side

Like Downtown, the North Side con-
tains sports and theater as well as muse-
ums and a brewery.

Three Rivers Stadium, home of the
Pittsburgh Pirates and Steelers, is located
across from the Point on the North Side.

Next to the stadium is the Carnegie
Science Center which offers hands-on
exhibits, a World War II submarine, a
planetarium and an OMNIMAX theater.
The exhibits are geared toward kids, but
some of the other options are also for
adults. If you ever wanted to know how
much you weigh on Venus or Mars, this
is the place to go. Parking is $3, exhibits
only is $5.75, OMNIMAX only is $5.75,

exhibits and OMNIMAX‘ is $10,
exhibits and planetarium is $10,
exhibits, planetarium and OMNIMAX is
$12 and the submarine is $3.50. The
center is open every day from 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. except Thanksgiving, Christmas
and New Year’s Day.

The Warhol Museum, located off
Seventh Street, is Pittsburgh’s tribute to
its own prodigal son. The museum is
filled with various mediums used by
Warhol throughout his career, from the
well-known silk screens to the film
“Blow Job.” The museum also has a cof-
feehouse and gift shop. It is open
Wednesday and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6
p.m., and Thursday through Saturday 11
a.m. to 8 p.m. Student tickets are $3.

The Pittsburgh Aviary, located on
Allegheny Commons West, is a national
aviary which houses over 450 birds and
225 species including exotic and endan-
gered birds. The aviary is open seven
days a week from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
and admission is $4.

The Pittsburgh Public Theater, located
at Allegheny Square, will be running

Allegheny Brewery & Pub. The pub fea-
tures German cuisine.

To get to the North Side by bus, catch
the 54C on Fifth Avenue across from
Children’s Hospital. One—way fare is
$1.25.

Strip District

Warehouses ﬁlled with fresh produce,
bread, meat, cheese, fish, baked goods,
pasta and more fill the half-mile “strip”
along Penn Avenue and Smallman
Street. ’

The Strip District is parallel to the
Allegheny River and features many
restaurants and clubs on its boardwalk.

“The Boardwalk in the Strip District is
a great place to relax, unwind and watch
the boats come and go,” said Erkel.

And when you’re through relaxing,
head over to Metropol or Rosebud to
dance and hear live music or stop by one
of the many restaurantsfor dinner.

Also, Coffeehouses, street vendors and
art galleries blend into the open—air mar-
ket atmosphere.

To get to the Strip District, take the
54C. It will cost you $1.25.

South Side/Station Square

Carson Street on the South Side is a
plethora of bars, restaurants and shops.

There are a multitude of antique, vin-
tage, consignment and other specialty
shops. Everything from flowers and pot-
tery to furniture and hard-to—find books

Also in the South Side is
Station Square, a converted rail
station which used to be home
to the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie
Railroad.

Station Square is full of
places to shop and dine. Sports,
clothing, toy and book stores
are just a few of the shops in
the mall.

Inside the mall are restaurants
specializing in Italian, Mexican,

burgers, fondue and hot dogs.

for the winter season; check

the Monongahela Incline, one
of the few inclines left in the

Washington, offering a view of
the city skyline and restaurants
with picturesque views.

Options available for Pitt students purchasing textoooks for classes

By Kathleen Scanlon
Staff Writer

Pitt senior Pete Ahwesh said
his strategy for saving money
on textbooks works.

“At first I don’t buy them
and I see what I can get by
without,” he said.

After establishing which
textbooks he cannot get by
without, Ahwesh visits the
Campus Bookstore on Forbes
Avenue, Pitt’s Un_iversity Book
Center and the library. He said
the library supplies most of the
materials he needs for class.

Ahwesh said he has also got-
ten books from the Campus

Bookstore.

“I’d rather not get books at
the University Book Center,”
he said. “The prices are pretty
freaking high for what you
get.”

“We know what Pitt’s charg-
ing and we’re below them,”
said Mike Chizmar, the owner
of the Campus Bookstore. “We
will not be beaten in prices at
all.”

The Campus Bookstore
began to compete with Pitt’s
Book Center when it opened
its doors on Nov. 1, 1993.

“We’re mainly here for the
textbook market,” said
Chizmar, but the store also has

a limited supply of commercial
books, children’s books, refer-
ence books. school supplies
and clothing.

Chizmar buys used books
from national book brokers
who buy books from students.
Because he stocks mostly used
books, he can sell them at low
prices, he said, and he backs
his low price claim with a
guarantee.

“If we find out from some-
one that Pitt is selling a partic-
ular textbook for cheaper than
us, we’ll drop our price,” he
said.

tion that specifies what text-
books Pitt professors require
for their classes.

But students may not find all
the textbooks they need .at the
Campus Bookstore. Pitt cus-
tom publishes some textbooks.
like the materials for Freshman
Studies, so those materials are
only available at the University
Book Center, Chizmar said.

Director of the University
Book Center Mary Bonach
said students can find all of
their books at the Book Center.

“We know what books are
required through the teachers,”
Bonach said.

does not carry books required
for many upper—level language
and literature classes. Upper-
level literature classes often
use “strange books” and have
low enrollment, Chizmar said.
Upper-level foreign language
classes often use foreign
books. - .

“The foreign publishers usu-
ally have a no—returns policy
and it usually takes a while to
get them in, so it’s not worth it
for me to try to get them,”
Chizmar said.

The class enrollment and
availability of the book deter-
mines whether Chizmar will
try to get that book.

But Chizmar said he does
have textbooks that freshmen
may need for subjects like
chemistry, math and biology.
as well as for other general
survey courses.

Freshman Karie Danner said
she has heard of the Campus
Bookstore and of its claim to
have lower prices, but finds it
more convenient to get all her
textbooks at the Book Center.

“I seem to be finding every-
thing I need here,” she said.

Jonas Tune, a Colgate
University student who took
summer classes at Pitt, said he
would have liked to have
known about the Campus
Bookstore before buying text-
books for his classes at the
Book Center.

“I would have checked it
out,” he said. Tune spent about
$100 for textbooks this sum-
mer and says he thought Pitt’s
prices were “pretty steep.”

Rachel Bauman will begin
graduate studies in business
this fall at Pitt. She said she

. went to the Campus Bookstore

before she came to the Book
Center. She found one text-
book that she needed at the
Campus Bookstore, but the
price was the same  Pitt’s
because the book was a new

prices at the Campus

Commuting to Piﬂ

Parking, food, transportation, computers available to over 20,000 commuters

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

With approximately 27,000
undergraduate and, graduate full
and part-time students enrolled
at the university, 5,000 live in
campus residence halls while the
other 22,000 either live in
Oakland, Shadyside and Squirrel
Hill or commute from outside
areas.

With the large amount of
commuters, Pitt provides
options for parking, transporta-
tion, food services, computer
labs and study areas.

Over 120,000 vehicles come
through Oakland each day,
30,000 of those belong to Pitt
employees, faculty and students,
according to Jan Thomas, assis-
tant director for parking at Pitt.

“We encourage students not to
bring vehicles on to campus,”
Thomas said.

With the amount of com-
muters coming on to campus,
Pitt provides a variety of parking
and alternative options.

Theuniversity owns 4,500
parking spaces, which according
to Thomas, is generally small in

comparison to other universities _

the same size as Pitt. ,
“There is just no room to
spread out,”“Thomas said.
Of those 4,500 spaces, about
1,061 spaces are available for.

commuting students.

9 University parking lots avail.-
able to students are: '

-OC Lot‘—— This lot, located

first-come, first-serve basis. A
shuttle runs from this lot to Fifth
Avenue between 6 and 10 a.m.

and 3 and 7 p.m.
°O’Hara and Soldiers and
Sailors garages — These

garages are not just for universi-
ty students and employees, but

Thomas said Pitt will enforce
parking regulations by fining,
booting and towing. Students
should also be aware of parking
on a side street in Oakland,
because they are residential
parking areas and require a per-
mit. She said students could also
incur city ﬁnes.

Because of the lack of parking
and the amount of traffic in
Oakland, there are many options
other than driving on to campus,
Thomas said.

“Oakland is very congested 
we want to make life better,”
said Kathleen Miller, an admin-
istrator in the Department of
Parking and Transportation. She
said the quality of life is‘

improved because the air is be-t—.' '0

ter. —
Pitt’s Ridesharing Office pro-

vides a carpooling computer

match-up service. This service

- gives you a list of other students

and faculty in your area that
wish to carpool.

According to Thomas, this
service is not so much for stu-
dents as it is for faculty because
of the varied schedules, but is
available. ‘Currently, there are
230 registered car pools serving
almost 500 people.

Taking a Port Authority
Transit bus to campus is also
another option which the
Department of Parking and
Transportation (PAT) is wishing
to improve.

“We’ve been working with
PAT for about a year [to get]
reduced bus passes  but we’re
still negotiating to get [the most
inexpensive price,]” Thomas
said.

She said based on how many
would apply, the department
could perhaps get cheaper rates.

Currently, monthly passes are
$40 in zone 1, $51 in zone 2,
$62 in zone 3, $73 in zone 4 and
$113 in zone 5 and can be pur-
chased at the William Pitt Union
ticket office or the Parking
Office in 1D10 in Forbes Quad.
The pass is good for unlimited
rides during the month any-
where. PAT maps and schedules
can be picked up in the VV1lliam
Pitt Union or the Department of
Parking and Transportation in
Forbes Pavilion.

“Those are all fabulous prices
in comparison to parking and
driving,” said Miller. Once

adding everything up, the bus _

sounds pretty good, she said.

students toand from North
Oakland, South Oakland,
Shadyside, Squirrel Hill and the

Students who choose the alter-

native of biking can find parking ’

at 25 different bike racks around
campus.‘ Thomas said the
department wants to get another
25.

“We want to provide enough
bicycling spaces, so students
don’t chain their bikes to a tree,
parking meter or handicapped
railing,” Thomas said.

The Department of Parking

and Transportation said it wants
students to register their bikes,
so it can tell whether_the bike
racks are in the right location,
can see if there is a need for
more bike racks, can help in the
identification of lost or stolen
bikes and can serve as a deter-
rent to crime.

The department will sponsor a
bike fair Sept.‘27 at the William
Pitt Union. Along with the
Pittsburgh Cycling Coalition, the
department will provide demon-
strations, bike safety, bike main-
tenance, education, displays and
new items on the market.

Parking and transportation
information booths will be set
up all over campus the first
week of school. The department
will also be represented at the
Student Activities Fair Aug. 30
in Forbes Quad.

“We are here to inform, edu-
cate and serve,” Miller said.

Commuters who do not have
access to computers at home can
find computer labs on campus

Pitt Resident Assistants friends and counselors, not police

By ‘Kathleen Scanlon
Staff Writer

Five strips, parallel to each
other, line the ﬂoor.

Strip number one represents
the opinion that one should
never justify a rape by a
woman’s dress or behavior.
Strip number five represents the
opinion that a woman’s actions
can encourage and merit a rape.

“lt’s usually all the girls down
here [on strip one] and all the
guys up here [on strip five],”
said Jennifer Dague, a resident
assistant (RA) at Pitt. “And then
they talk about it to see who’s
wrong and who’s right.”

Planning presentations like
this in which RAs discuss issues
they think are important to their
residents constitutes part of an
RA’s multifarious duties.

“T hey’re a friend, a counselor,
an educator, at times a discipli-
narian,” said Cheryl Ferraro, the
area coordinator for the Office
of Residence Life. “It’s a fine
balance. They’re not parents

the ﬂoor. “They can do whatev-
er they want to make the ﬂoor
like home,” she said.

Fomey has organized trips to
baseball games and the
Camegie-Science Center. Not
only do the trips provide social
opportunities, but they also give
freshmen exposure‘ to the bus
system, something they may
need to use during their time at
Pitt, Fomey said.

Grogan said an RA’s first
floor meeting can set the tone
for the whole year. At her first
meeting, she discusses sexual
violence and roommate prob-
lems. She presents a “roommate
contract,” which outlines every-
thing roommates might have
conflicts about, and discusses
each point. Grogan said she
encourages roommatesto talk
about minor problems early in
the term to prevent a blow up
later on and a subsequent sepa-
ration based on irreconcilable
differences.

When a blow up does occur,
Grogan mediates between the
two. During Grogan’s time as an
RA only two women on her
ﬂoor have moved out because of
roommate problems, Grogan
said. One of those instances, she
 was inevitable.

“The two people were so
completely different,” she said.
“It was like pairing ‘Beverly
Hills 902-10’ with ‘The Beverly
Hillbillies’ before they got their
fortune.”

RAs must also confront and ~

deal with problems of a more
serious nature, including alcohol
incidents, substance abuse prob-
lems and sexual assault.
_ “Initially when I was waiting
to be an RA, I was apprehensive
about confronting people about
their behavior, looking like the
bad guy,” Forney said. “Now,
when I see an incident I'm con-
ﬁdent that I’m able to respond
to it. I don’t think it would have
gotten that way as quickly as it
did if I hadn’t been trained.”
Personnel from the ORL train
RAs in counseling issues, teach-

- ing them how to confront differ-

ent situations, according to
Ferraro.

Grogan said drug and alcohol
incidents are relatively easy to
deal with.

“Those things are very cut-
and-dry,” she said. “If you smell
marijuana, you call the RD
[Resident Director] and the
campus police and that’s it. [The
residents] know therules, they
know they’re in the wrong.”

But other, less predictable
problems have arisen.

“There was a girl on my ﬂoor
who tried to commit suicide last
year. That was pretty tough,”
said Dague, who talked to the
woman almost constantly and
spent time with her in the hospi-
tal.

_ Dague said she feels that inci-.
dent is an example of what kind
of impact RAs can have on the
residents they serve.

“She’s alive,” Dague said.

Transportation arouncl Piﬂ getting even be-Her

By Chuck Hoffman
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s extensive transporta-
tion system is getting even
better due to a recent survey.

If students were around last
spring they may remember
people asking them to take
part in a transportation survey,
a survey that is now responsi-
ble for some changes to
improve Pitt’s transportation

system.
“We compiled the data from
the surveys,” said John

Morgan, assistant directoriof
the Department of Parking and
Transportation. “Many of our
standard services will not be
changed. We provide buses
and shuttles to Shadyside,
Squirrel Hill, North Oakland,
South Oakland,‘ Upper
Campus and the Biotech
Center  with a few excep-
_tions, the students seem to be
happy with them as they are.”
Peggy Montgomery, driver

of the North Oakland and

South Oakland routes this
summer, agreed.

“As far as I know most stu-
dents are happy, come winter
they’re real happy,”
Montgomery said.

Many North and South
Oakland residents use the
shuttle to commute to campus,
according to Montgomery.

“I see people coming to and
from school and work  stu-
dents, faculty, anybody affili-
ated with Pitt,” Montgomery
said.

Also, the Shadyside and
Squirrel Hill buses help bring
commuters to campus.

“A. lot of people live in
Shadyside and Squirrel Hill
and use the buses,”
Montgomery said. “I some-
times drive the back-up bus to
take the overﬂow.”

Other services remaining the
same are the Biotech shuttle
and the handicapped van.

“The Biotech shuttle is
mostly for medical students,
but there are some com-

muters,” driver Sharon Wilmer
said. “The handicapped van
has door-to-door service  It
has wheelchair lifts and rail-
ings for people on crutches.”

Morgan said one of the most
successful services is Van-
Call.

“It’s the university’s version
of a taxi cab,” he said.

Students can be picked up
and driven anywhere on cam-
pus and most places in North
and South Oakland between 7
p.m. and 2:30 a.m. Sunday
through Wednesday. Thursday
through Saturday, it stays open
until 3 a.m.

“You see the party animals
on that run. The wild ones,”
one driver said referring to the
late night service on week-
ends.

The Department of Parking '

and Transportation used the
negative feedback in the sur-
veys to improve the system.

“We tried to address the stu-
dents’ biggest complaints,”
said Morgan. 9

One of the most common
complaints, Morgan said, was
the wait for a shuttle to the
upper campus. The response is
a rearrangement of the upper
campus route into two 20-
minute loops.

“Our goal is to see to it that
a student never has to wait
more than 10 minutes,”
Morgan said.

Although students said they
were generally happy with
Van-Call, some surveys com-
plained about the waiting time.
So starting in the fall, the
transportation department will
be adding another dispatcher

all lines are busy, a recording

In the past the student would

Parking permit fees will increase for Fiscal Year 1995, the first increase in monthly rates since September
1990. Monthly rates in lots and garages will increase by only $500 while two permit types will increase by
:7.S0 per month (ZZ and VN). A concerted effort by the parking staff to keep fees as low as possible is
. emonstrated by the modest amount of the increase. Transient and evening student permit rates will also
lnirfase slightly. Rate increases are; effective Aug. 1, 1994. Carpoolers will retain the current rates this year.
W ie no one 1S ever happy about increased fees, you will find that ours continue to be among the lowest
compared to other Oakland parking rates.

P kT he budget for the Parking Office is a little more than $4.5 million. As an auxiliary of the University, the

are pai or by the revenues generated. Of particular note is that 44.7 percent of each dollar is spent to

Gerst said this doesn’t mean that most

said.

As if not even realizing the obvious
contrast, several students followed up
their elaborations on Thursday night rev-
elry with more serious thoughts on the
traditional success of a major part of the
university -— the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center.

“When I’m home, the only thing I ever
hear about Pitt in the news is when
they’ve made some sort of medical
breakthrough or transplant or some-
thing,” Sarah Winwood of New York
City said. “Pitt really is known nation-
wide for its hospitals.”

According to Laura Kelly of Pitt’s
Health‘Sciences News Bureau, the
UPMC has achieved prominence among
the world’s academic medical centers, in
part because the “history of the UPMC is
rich with the names of distinguished
researchers and clinicians whose fore-
sight and determination have led to inno-
vative medical treatments.”

Certainly one of Pitt’s most famous
researchers is Dr. Jonas Salk, developer
of the polio virus vaccine in 1954. In
1955, the Polio Center in Michigan
announced his vaccine to be extremely
effective and “incredibly safe,” therefore
saving thousands of children from the
crippling disease.

Since then, the UPMC basic and clini-
cal researchers have helped in advancing
medicine in many areas, most notably
cancer research and transplantation.

“People don’t know about the great
research done here,” Pitt Stop owner
Chas Bonasorte said. “I meet people all
the time with the [UPMC] name tags
who are from Kansas or somewhere, and
are at Pitt because someone in their fam-
ily is getting a transplant. People come to

Pitt from all over the world to get their
lives saved.”

The recent work of Dr. Henry
Bahnson and Dr. Thomas Starzl revolu-
tionized organ transplantation and
defined the UPMC as the world’s lead-
ing transplantation center, according to
the Health Sciences News Bureau.

“When you have things like this in
your backyard, you just take it for grant-
ed,” Bonasorte said. “But there really is
a strong medical tradition at Pitt.”

Daley also said there were many tradi-
tions at Pitt which many people may not
know, such as annual scholarships.

“The Emma Locke scholarship has
been a Pitt tradition since 1946, awarded
to an outstanding undergraduate senior
who is nominated by their dean.” Daley
said. _ -
A tradition which students felt they
knew too much about were “rites of pas-
sage” which most students felt they

could do without, such as living in the

Towers for a year.

“Freshmen should all have to live in
the Towers for a year, because you meet
so many people and share so many expe-
riences,” senior Chris Murphy said. “But
I would never do it again for as long as I
live.”

According to junior Jeff Thompson, it
was the best and worst of times.

“It seemed like we were always hav-
ing fun in the Towers,” Thompson said.
“But you never had time to yourself and
couldn’t get anything done, it got frus-
trating.”

Senior Jill Sherman said buying books
is among her worst experiences at Pitt,

. but is something which has become a

tradition.

Tradition

°From page A-19
. “I dread the whole experience,” she said. “You
go into [the bookstore] anytime during the first
few days and it seems like your trapped for hours
with a bunch of stressed-out strangers.”

However, it seems one of Pitt’s richest tradi-
tions in te'rms of culture was overlooked by
almost everyone who offered their opinion on tra-
dition, even though each of them has probably
experienced, it, the Nationality Rooms in the
Cathedral of Learning.

Since 1926, the rooms have depicted traditions
from around the world in the realm of decorative
arts such as carving, weaving, painting, stone
work, stained glass and architectural forms.

The students and faculty who work in these
rooms for hours each semester don’t realize the
traditions that thousands of visitors learn while
touring the rooms: from holiday activities to a tra-
dition of the Chinese Room — patting the heads
of stone laughing lions at the entrance to make a
wish come true.

“Members of Quo Vadis, volunteer students
who interpret the rooms to visitors, incorporate
traditions [such as] international pot—luck dinners”
and wearing national dress into their activities,
according to a statement by Nationality Rooms
Program Director E. Maxine Bruhns.

Pitt Program Council Student Director Leslie
Tulleo said students should take it upon them-
selves to get involved with creating tradition.
“You must make yourself a part of tradition,” she
said. ..

Students will have the opportunity throughout
this year to get involved with the creation of tradi-
tion. The first chance for freshmen to participate
and kick off their college career is the Freshman
Convocation, Pitt’s newest tradition.

“It is a formal welcome to freshmen to the aca-
demic arena,” Director of New Student Programs
Brenda Pardini said of Saturday’s serviceon the
Cathedral Lawn. “We’re hoping it catches on
with more students and their families.”

The service included an address by the chancel-
lor, College of Arts and Sciences Dean Mary L.
Briscoe and_Student Government Board President
Ross Pasquale. Pardini said each year the ceremo-
nial book “Philosophical and Miscellaneous
Papers” will be given to a random freshman at the
convocation. Written by Ben Franklin, the book
was published in 1787, the same year as the
founding of Pitt.

Another emerging tradition at Pitt is the annual
jazz festival at the beginning of November, driven
by Pitt professor and jazz artist Dr. Nathan Davis.

“It is some of the best live jazz that a college
student can hear and it only costs $5,” Greg Del
Duca said.

Hillman Library stack supervisor Bill Forsythe,
who said he’s worked at Pitt for “30-some” years,
said the trend of massive automation and comput-
ers is the biggest change he’s seen at Pitt.
“Traditionally, students here study hard,”
Forsythe said. “I have a lot of respect for the stu-
dents I’ve worked with.”

Daley, who is also Greek coordinator at Pitt,
said even though it isn’t a campus-wide tradition,
Greek life is full of tradition.

“Many of our fraternities and sororities have
been at Pitt for more than 75 years, each having
its own traditions which they renew every year,”
Daley said

Pitt may not have the tradition of elite alumni
such as Harvard, and Yale, or legendary athletics
such as Notre Dame and the University of
California — Los Angeles, but administrators and
students found plenty of which to be proud during
their careers at Pitt.

For those years between Freshman

Convocation and the annual spring commence-
ment at the Civic Arena, which Book Center
Director Mary Bonach calls “one of Pitt’s. most
impressive events,” it seems Pitt students have
ample opportunity to get involved with tradition.

Even if they refuse-to do it more than four days
per week.

the Book Center for $48.

Bonach said it was unfair to
comment on the situation
unless a larger survey was
done to compare prices.

Chizmar said Pitt students
will not have to deal with long
waits at the Campus
Bookstore. Students need only
give either their class sched-
ule, the computer printout or
the pink registration slip, to
Chizmar.

“In about two minutes, I
come back with a stack of
books,” he said. “We have to
give students a reason to walk
down here.”

Bonach said the Book
Center offers extended hours
at the beginning of the semes-
ter to help shorten the tradi-
tionally long lines.

The University Book

Exchange Referral System, or

UBERS, presents students
with another possible money-
saving strategy.

CGS Student Government
Council members, who run
UBERS, hook up students
who want to sell their used
textbooks with students who
need those textbooks, accord-
ing to UBERS.

The student who wants
to unload the textbook must
register the book with UBERS
by calling 648-7899 between
-Aug. 29 and Sept. 13. The
phone line is open Monday
through Friday, 9 a.m. to

5 p.m.. A student may also
fill out an UBERS registration
form and mail it to: CGS
Student Government, Attn
UBERS, 615 William Pitt
Union, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260.

Students who want to buy
used textbooks should also call
the UBERS phone, line. The
phone representative will give
the student the name and num-
ber of the person who has the
textbook that the student
needs. All transactions take
place directly between the stu-
dent buying and the student
selling.

Students aren’t the only ones
who try to cut costs of buying
required texts for classes.

“We really shop around for
cheap books,” said Madeleine
Hurd, assistant professor of
history at Pitt. But if profes-
sors assign less books in an
effort to cut costs for students,
the class may be boring, she
said.

“It depresses the quality of
teaching at Pitt,” she said.

Hurd blamed “the deteriorat-
ing publishing industry” for
the high prices of textbooks.
Academic publishing houses
are “cutting their losses by
soaking the students,” she
said. I

“Altogether, the students are
bearing the burden.

“A student consumer revolt”
may be the only thing that will
stiﬂe the rising prices of text-
books, Hurd said.

most of the situations. As the
university’s chief academic offi-
cer where do you see ethics at
Pitt today? Should teachers be
doing‘ more or are thestudents
to blame?

JM: I don’t think you can iso-
late the blame at any one cause

like classroom size or teacher -

inattentiveness or student lack of
integrity, but they are all
involved and we’ve got to do
better on all of them. On the
other hand the tuition pressures
that we talked about a minute
ago would indicate that large
classrooms are something we
have to learn to live with, and
then the question is how do
we reach our community, stu-
dents and faculty, and convince
the students that for their own
personal development it is
important not to cheat and con-
vince the faculty thatwe will
make the system work and it is
worth the hassle to prosecute
cheaters.

SK: Even though you are not
directly involved with the
UPMC (University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center,) in your opin-
ion has the university been hurt
by the allegations against Dr.
Bernard Fisher and the charges
made recently against Pitt by
Fisher?

JM: The entire incident is one
that we all wish had never hap-
pened. Time will tell whether
we are able to respond so well to
it that we end up looking very
good.

SK: Asa member of the faculty,
a research scientist and now an

administrator, what do you feel. ‘

are Pitt’s strongest attributes?
JM: Pitt has a large number of
very high quality academic pro-
grams and a good tradition of
encouraging students at all lev-
els to get involved in those pro-
grams. I

SK: On the other hand, what do
you feel it most needs to
improve upon?

JM: I think our biggest single
problem is a combination of the
impersonality of a large urban
university with a morale prob-
lem which feeds on that imper-
sonality.

SK:-How do you suggest to go
about that?

JM: One way is by word of
mouth. If new students who
arrive at the university learn
from existing students that there
are these high quality programs
available and that even the
newest freshman is welcome to
go to the relevant program and
learn how to get involved in it.
Thatwill go a long way in help-
ing with that morale problem.
Once someone becomes a part
of one of the good programs
then that person is involved in:
first off, a community that inter-
ests the student; second, a com-
munity that is somewhat smaller
than the university as a whole
and thirdly in most cases, some-
thing that has a little bit of a
family atmosphere to it, at least
in commonality of interest if
nothing else.

SK: The Chronicle of Higher
Education reported earlier this
month that Congress earmarked

' close to $651 million in fiscal

year 1994 for projects involving
specific colleges. The
University of Pittsburgh
received over $120 million of
this, nearly 20 percent. Pitt has
had a strong research history for
decades. How do you feel these
grants affect Pitt overall?

JM: Yes, Pitt competes very
well for grants on the national
level and those grants are essen-
tial for running our graduate
programs and other professional
training programs as well. Our
success in getting those grants is
a measure of the quality of the
programs we have here.

SK: There are a lot of students
that can slip through the cracks
unnoticed at Pitt. What do you
think of the average quality of
education for Pitt undergradu-
ates?

JM: I think we have pretty good
undergraduate programs here.
It’s a rather high quality of edu-
cation that we are offering. But
there’s no doubt about it that we
want to keep reviewing our pro-
grams and making sure they

stay good, and looking for ways
to improve them, and one of the
ways to improve programs at
any state university is to try and
reach out to the undergraduate
who would like to slip through
the cracks and try to convince
that student to take advantage of
the higher quality education that
is available here.

SK: Pitt faculty are underappre-
ciated, according to you. Is that
right?

JM: Yes.

SK: Having been a member of
the faculty and now an adminis-
trator, do you think there is a
permanent rift between faculty
and administration at Pitt?

JM: I hope it’s not permanent
and I think there is every reason
for the Pitt faculty and adminis-
tration to cooperate with each
other and encourage each other.
The faculty aspirations, as artic-
ulated over the years, are all
obviously being worked on.
There is a serious effort to
improve the library and a seri-
ous effort to improve instruc-
tional facilities. What we really

need here is the faculty and
administration to band together
to make our programs and ambi-
tions as embodied in both pro-
gram goals and construction
goals work. One obvious way to
make them work is for the facul-
ty and administration to band
together to have the most suc-
cessful possible fundraising
capabilities rather than have an
atmosphere of distrust.

SK: As a student, I am worried.
and I have talked to other stu-
dent leaders who are also wor-
ried that Pitt’s emphasis on
research is drowning out the
importance of teaching. Do you
think this is happening?

JM: I think that misses the
point. I know that many people
say that and I think they are
missing the main issue there.
There is no way to have a really
high quality program without
having the faculty and the most
advanced students, the graduate
students, involved in cutting
edge research. The challenge is
to excite the undergraduates
about the intellectual ferment

’that’s going on all around them '

and to draw them in and include
them in that research, and give
them opportunities that at small-
er less research—oriented institu-
tions would not be available to
them. We need to work on mak-
ing the environment exciting for
the students so that they see that
it is really wonderful to have
this research around here, but I
don’t think that research versus
teaching is a fruitful way to look
at the problem. In particular,
many, if not most, of our best
teachers are among our best
researchers.

SK: Do you have any advice for
the incoming students that they
should heed during their higher
education? ,

JM: Take advantage of what we
have here. Take advantage of
the best courses. Take advantage
of the best extracurricular activi-‘
ties. Get involved in the student
life of the campus. And make
sure that during your four years
here you really don’t miss a
chance to grow intellectually
and socially.

“The means are there for the
university to move into the 21st

“Let’s see what specials they

After about a 20—second wait

have to read the instructions
more closely.’’ If you can read,
you can crack any Internet enig-
ma. “Anyone following the
instructions on the screen can
learn how to use it,” he said.

Mosaic users can also view
weather satellite pictures. On
the “What’s New Page” we
found weather reports and
color—coded weather charts for
each of the sites of World Cup
‘94.

A gallery of other images will
grace CIS computer screens this
fall. A fan of the television
series “Babylon 5,” Schatz
retrieved a picture of the
Babylon 5 spaceship, blasting
away in color.

But how can I be like
O’Brien and join that Dave
Barry discussion group?

On the Usenet, another facet

of Internet, you can subscribe to
any of the 600 to 700 discus-
sion groups, commonly called
“newsgroups” on the Net, to

which Pitt subscribes. The
groups range “from the serious
who discuss problems  to peo-
ple sharing jokes,” Schatz said.

Matthew Carlisle/Staff Photographer

Students like senior Ed Lillion can use the computers in the
labs to research as well as —write their papers.

Here’s one

 

When you subscribe to a
newsgroup, you can read and
respond to anything any other
member of the group has sent

over the Usenet. Topics that '

people discuss on-line include
historical subjects like the Civil
War and TV shows like
“Babylon 5” and “Star Trek: the
Next Generation.” You can also
search by key word for a group
that discusses a topic that inter-
ests you. "

Unlike other areas of the
Internet, where anybody can
write anything, right or wrong,
the Usenet “monitors itself,”
Schatz said. “If you put some-
thing out there that’s wrong,
you’ll get flamed. People will
write back and say  ‘you’re
out to lunch.”’

Schatz grinned after reading
the “Babylon 5” writer’s
response to a criticism that a
member of the “Babylon 5"
newsgroup sent over the
Usenet.

“How many times do you get
to communicate with the writer
of your favorite TV show?”
Schatz said.

And for all those Pitt students
who do their best work only
after their daily dose of procras-
tination, the Internet offers an
assortment of games —— card

games, board games, space

games and others.

This facet of lntemet is called
Fetch and it works like a
“graphical FTP,” Schatz said.

game listed on the Internet that
you want to play, you issue a
command, then Fetch will copy
that game onto your machine.

“I saw the game Cribbage on
the network. I used Fetch to get
it to my machine,” Schatz said.

Schatz accessed the card
game Pinochle 4. “I don’t know
how to play this,” he said. But
the directions appear on the
screen, so if he really wanted to
play it, he could have.

But before you rush off to the
busiest lab on campus to learn
how to play Pinochle 4, be
warned that the current CIS
game-playing policy remains
intact.

“If the lab is not busy, we turn
the other cheek, we don’t look."
Schatz said. “If the lab is busy,
we’ll ask you to leave the com-
puter.”

Pitt is currently working on
its policies and rules governing
the use of the Internet, Schatz
said. But some blemishes may
still surface on the system and
Pitt may not be able to wipe
them away.

“All information you see on
the Internet is all at your own
risk,” Schatz wamed. “Pitt isn’t
saying it’s gospel because any-
one can post it.”

The Pitt News, Monday, August 29, 1994

Take pride in Pitt

Heads up.

This is the beginning of the school year.

A lot of things are going to be thrown your way.

There will be long lines at the bookstore.

People in Thackeray Hall who are supposed to help
you out will end up confusing you even more than you
were when you first walked in. The people in Bruce Hall are no
better. .

Also, be careful of the College of Arts and Science advisors
who are helping you. You might end up carrying 18 credits of
complex science and mathematics courses, when you only
intend to major in pottery.

Oh, hope really hard that one of your classes does not get can-
celled because there weren’t enough people to fill it.

At least one of the above mentioned will happen to you. if not
all of them at one time.

Face it, everyone has a Thackeray Hall horror story.

But when all these things are happening, sit back, calm down
and remember why you are here: ‘

—— to learn and to have a good time. _

Too many students have destroyed their academic lives by
getting caught up in the intoxicating haze of apathy that
glazes over the eyes of Pitt students as they settle into the school
yeah ' p

Look around you and take notice of the incredible opportuni-
ties that are at your feet, yours for the taking.

Besides having one of the best medical centers in the
world, Pitt is well-recognized for its strength in/the academic
arena.

Pitt is ranked nationally in many programs offered here,
including law, public and international affairs, business, English,
engineering, philosophy, biology and many other programs we
simply do not have the room to mention.

It does not take a big person to notice the faults of others; a
real person can point out the good characteristics of a person as
well. 7 I

Although a bumbling bureaucracy such as Pitt can be hard
going on a student trying to achieve a goal, the student needs to
understand that a school handling 27,000 students is going to
have its mix—ups. 7 ii  i it

A part of guaranteeing yourself a memorable time at this
school is getting involved outside of the classroom. A

There are a lot of opportunities at Pitt that will help you have a
successful career while you are here as well as after college.

There are many organizations, sports clubs, fraternities and
sororities to join which will help you develop closer ties to the
school. i 4

While Pitt offers an excellent academic program that will chal-
lenge you intellectually, a vital part of learning is done while
talking with different people outside the classroom.

You will only get out of Pitt what you put intoit.

A good education starts with a good attitude. That will
help you go a long way, even when your days in school are long
over.

ested-in getting in,.gettingi

drunk, getting laid and then
getting out so that they can go
make a living and become
“respectable.”

These days, so many people
wander aimlessly through life
without purpose, without
meaning, without direction
and without commitment —
and they wonder why they’re
so discontented. Think I’m just
blowing smoke?

Just watch the “beautiful
people,” almost all of them
college graduates, get off the
EBA at the Negley Avenue
Station during afternoon rush
hour — they just look so
empty. —

Where is the love of life?
What happened to discovery,
trying new things, new people
and situations —— or are we too
“grown-up” for that? I don’t
know if it’s cynicism or igno-
rance, but things have
changed, and I don’t think for
the better.

Now, I’m far too young to
remember the turbulent 1960s,
but I have learned that college
students back then were pas-
sionate, if at times misguided,
about the things they believed
in.

Opposition _to the Vietnam
War was in vogue, and protest-
ers even managed to shut
down, among other places, the
normally conservative and
placid Geneva College campus
in Beaver Falls. And let’s not
forget that the “sit-in” was
invented by students at North
Carolina A & T State
University who were denied

X service at a Woolworth’s lunch

counter because they were
black. .

Their attitude was “if you
don’t serve us, you won’t
serve anyone.” Next thing any-
one knew, the sit-in concept
spread like wildfire all over
the South and became an inte-
gral part of the civil rights
movement.

Today, however, war ‘protest-
ers are all but ignored, and
those who continually com-
plain about racism are often
answered with an “Aw, shut
up!”

But that’s not all.
Controversial issues such as
abortion and gay rights hardly
make headlines these days.
Last spring’s flap concerning
Carnegie Mellon University
student Patrick Mooney, who
was accused of harassing a gay

' drama professor, drew little

more than yawns from much
of that campus.

Only a few seem to care
about, to give an example, the
moral dilemmas surrounding
condom distribution -— does it
promote promiscuity or save
lives?

But there’s more than issues
these days. What about educa-
tion itself? The actual process
of learning is no longer
important — Dr. Campolo was
giving a lecture, pouring his
heart out for his students, and

one of them asked him, “Do

we have to know this for the
midterm?”
A number of years ago, I

‘attended the commencement

exercises for a couple of
friends who were graduating
from CMU, and I noticed that
well overihalf of the Ph.D.s
were foreigners. (And then we

have the nerve to complain
about TAs who can barely
speak English!)

I am continually amazed as
to just how little respect, not to
mention compensation, teach-
ers get these days. Learning
for the sake oflearning is

- quickly becoming passe; it’s

no wonder that 'we’ve become
so mediocre ‘compared to the
rest of the industrialized world
when it comes to education.

Perhaps it’s once again time
for us students to call attention
to the emptiness, the meaning-
lessness that our society pro-
motes. i

I’m not talking about the
full—scale riots and mass
protests’ of a quarter-century
ago, but we may get involved
in smaller ways. There’s the
Hand—in—Hand festival every
spring on campus, for openers,
and there are a numberof
environmental groups in the
-area.

For the more spiritually

9 inclined, there are about a

dozen churches within a mile
of this campus, and there are
political and social groups too
numerous to mention here.

One friend from church,
looking for a way to serve
people, founded Habitat for
Humanity here in Pittsburgh
— and is currently building
houses in Nicaragua with the
international organization.

I remember the TV commer-
cial about a priest who was
visited by a number of his
buddies, one of who asked him
if he missed “civilization.” His_
response: “You mean banging
my head up against the wall to
get ahead? Going into hock up
to my eyeballs for the right
house, the right car? No, I
don’t miss it.”

That priest knew there were
important things that money or
status simply can’t buy — like
heart. There’s a job here for
everyone — all we need to do
is find it.

Many students are sea-
soned veterans of Pitt, confi-
dently crossing Bigelow
Boulevard between the
William Pitt Union and the
Cathedral of Learning,
unafraid of being hit by an
oncoming motorist. ,

Together these students
form one student body and
become Pitt students.

The forerunners of Pitt

students have been eagerly
and anxiously pursuing edu-
cation since 1787, when a log
schoolhouse was erected on
what is now the
Boulevard of the Allies in
downtown Pittsburgh.

In 207 ‘years of existence,
Pitt has been home to many
traditions:

The discovery of the polio
vaccine by Dr. Jonas Salk
is just one of the famous
revolutionary research break-

sity.

Lantern Night, the tradi-

Commons where they are
welcomed by the chancellor
and other administrators, is
another tradition, symbolic of
the strength of women pursu-

TheiPittiil\iews,

on campus. I myself have
had a few mishaps in
Thackeray Hall.

But if people stopped and
thought about it, there are
approximately 27,000 stu-
dents who are also pursuing
an education at this school.

While screwups happen,
they are not all that common.

Just remember not to take it
personally, it isn’t an
intentional conspiracy aimed
at you.

The thing is, there is far too
much to be involved with
here to concentrate on the
negative.

While Pitt offers us
an incredible opportunity
to enhance ourselves acade-
mically, students need to
realize that the real education
comes outside of the class-
room.

If people stop and think

°Tradition, page B-15

scene, where students take a
break from studies to relax,
blow off steam and have
a good time with friends, is
an unwritten tradition.

This is just a small sample
of the variety of positive
traditions that exist at Pitt.

There is, however, a very
negative tradition on campus
that affects a good number I
of students here —_student
apathy.

Too many students are
walking around in an apa-
thetic cloud of cynicism,
blind to the many opportuni-
ties Pitt provides them.

These students spend their
time indulging in self pity,
claiming to be victims of a
cruel monster called bureau-
cracy.

They need to get a grip.

Sometimes, the students"
do have a right to-get upset

Six room-
= I — mates in three
Columnist years. That’s
Stephen not bad. I
Kozarovich know people

who have had
more (14) and some who have
had less (0), but I think six is
above average.
As armentor and facilitator at
Pitt I have met many of the
incoming students during the
advising sessions this summer
and one topic I am surprised
has never brought up is room-
mates.

Maybe, in this latest “reces-
sion” more students have been
sharing rooms with siblings, but
growing up as an only child I
was presented with a big
change in my life when I came
to Pitt. I was forced to share a
room with someone I had never
met before.

Add to it, that I was selected
to live in the Towers my first
year at Pitt. I went from a com-
fortably sized bedroom to shar-
ing a room that was smaller and
it also served as my living

 
    
    

room, family room and study ‘

area. Don’t forget sharing the
same bathroom daily with 38
other guys is a little unusual.
And although I looked forward
to the challenge it proved to be
a big adjustment.

It is amazing that the only
time I have ever heard the sub--
ject of roommates brought up
during the advising sessions is
by the parents visiting with
their children. A parent asked
me if her son could change his
room if he had a roommate of a

-different race injthe fall. I guess

some parents worry about the
right things, but for the wrong
reasons. '

Differences. Not everyone is
the same and even the closest
of friends have trouble living
with each other. Habits of some
people are very annoying to
others. The key is to try and

_ accept the differences and work

it out by communication.

A friend of mine, a senior at
Pitt, sat down with her room-
mates one night and they told

each other what annoyed them‘

about each other. She said the
group soon began to realize
they were annoying people as
well as being annoyed.

After three years at Pitt, there
is one thing I must stress about
roommates —— communication.
Of course, I did not practice
what I preached until about

halfway into my third year and '

unfortunately many of my
roommates and I parted on bad
terms.

Scrificing education, communities for corporatism? 

n e -
igh-
bor-
hood is a
Folks know

each other or
at least of

 

Columnist each other.
Bloll There is an
Kirchner air of self-

sufficiency
about the place. What you
need you can get close by and
those who own the businesses
and housing live there year-
round sometimes through sev-
eral generations. At the very
least a community’s members
have a stake in what happens
in that space they call their
neighborhood.

Sure, it’s probably the stuff
of urban fantasy to expect any
semblance of the old-style
neighborhood that was once
Oakland to return. But do we
always have to replace the old
with cold facades and sterile,
ﬂuorescent—white insides?

When University Inc. reno-
vated the William Pitt Union it
gave us that nice little food
court, a knockoff of the food
factories found at your nearby
shopping mall. So I’m stand-
ing in the basement of what
was once the Schenley Hotel

and I feel more like I’m at the ‘

Monroeville Mall, watching
low—wage, no-benefit employ-
ees dish out pseudo ethnic
food in yet another strain of
the Wal-Marting of America. a

We’ve gone from a diverse
and dynamic community
which was bordered on all

sides with the ethnic neighbor- .

hoods of South Oakland,
North Oakland and the Hill
District to a part of town
which glistens with the ever-
growing steel and glass of
office buildings at whose
edges begin this city’s finest
examples of architectural dete-
rioration and urban blight. ,

Why? Because University
Inc. knows more about the bot-
tom line than it does about
community. University Inc.
and its real estate partners du
jour, such as National
Development, have been
instrumental in tearing down
the old architectural gems and
community landmarks of St
Peter’s Church and the Syria
Mosque and paid a small pub-
lic relations price in the
process. But the real crime
exists on streets like Oakland
Avenue, south of Forbes
Avenue.

University Inc. subsidiaries
like Property Management
purchase single-family
dwellings, splice them into
cheap student apartments and
enter the real estate business
under the auspices of provid-
ing safe housing for its stu-
dents. Take’ a walk down
Oakland Avenue. Guess which
houses are still owned by fam-
ilies who live in them, those
who haven’t sold out to
University Inc. It’s easy --
they stick out like sore thumbs.
Then take a short walk down

Fifth Avenue, and make a left
that takes you to 718
Devonshire Street. You’ll see a
historic mansion—manicured
lawns and gardens which are
professionally maintained, at
great expense, but you’ll
notice that minus the grand
scale it’s no more neatly cared
for than that handful of houses
so conspicuous on Oakland
Avenue.

Some people would claim
that the deterioration of our
neighbors’ housing in the Hill
District and South Oakland is

the result of disrespect and
laziness. Ask the folks at
Property Management to show
you the videotapes and
polaroids of the ridiculous
amounts of damage and
neglect found in apartments
they rent to supposedly nice,
middle—class white kids from
fine, upstanding families.
Again, you’ll see they behave
with little more respect for
their environment than anyone
else who has no stake of own-
ership in the place they live. a
While student transiency is

hard to avoid, one entity
remains —— University Inc. It
complains about the crime and
spends thousands and more of
our tuition dollars and taxpay-
er funds to buy its own police
force, its own transportation
system, all in an effort to insu-
late us from those villainous
have—nots. I suspect the whole
transportation system, which
we’re forced to pay for regard-
less of use, has more to do
with assuring well—heeled sub-
urban kids and their folks that
Johnny will never have to

come into contact with the
urban unwashed than it does

‘ his own safety.

Why not integrate students
into the community instead of
segregating them. Buy a PAT
bus pass like the rest of the
world and maybe they’ll take a
chance on seeing more of this
city than Oakland and its posh
neighbors, Shadyside and
Squirrel Hill. It- could be that

varied, diverse neighborhoods

o n c e
said life

is a series of
beginnings
and endings.
And for all of
you entering

Columnist Pitt this fall
Kathi that has prob-
Metinko ably never

been more
true.

This is the beginning of your
last years of schooling; you’ve
finally made it to the pinnacle
of higher education. It is the
beginning of total freedom for
you which welds total respon-
sibility in its path.‘

I’m sure you’re tired of

everyone telling you these«

should be the best years of
your life — enjoy them. Well
these people are old sage ones.
A wise person once said the
same to me before I embarked

on the strange and wondrous
journey through the hallowed
halls of academia; this wise
one added, moreover, that there
wasn’t very much I could do to
prevent them from being the
best years provided I always
remember I was now ultimate-
ly, and singularly, responsible
for my actions, decisions, etc.
College is the first time most
of us have the opportunity to
pick our classes from hundreds
of options, to pick the times of
those classes and even to
decide what days to take off
whether we’re sick or simply
need a “mental health day.”
From early on in this envi-
ronment of freedom and
enlightenment, we learn no one
wants to hear excuses either.
No one, particularly a profes-
sor, wants to hear that your

paper or you were sick and
missed the sixth consecutive
quiz.

That is not to say professors
have no heart because from the
moment I started college to the
day I graduated, I never met a
professor who wouldn’t listen
to a legitimate problem at least
once per student per semester.
Remember professors’
patience has been tried and

wears thin, not from legitimate.

exceptions, but from those who
abuse their sympathy and
understanding relentlessly to
their own self—serving ends.
(These are the same people
who didn’t learn the moral
from “The Boy Who Cried
Wolf.”)

Academic education is, of
course, just one facet of the
college experience. Since class
attendance only requires, on
average, 15 hours a week,
where is the rest of your time

The Pitt News, Monday, August 29, 1994

spent?

This is what I see as the far
more trying aspect. Most stu-
dents who decide to challenge
academia are used to the
demands and expectations of
courses, after all they have sur-
vived l3 years of school to get
here. What most students
beginning college haven’t
experienced is the complete, at
least near complete, freedom
that surrounds their daily lives.

Most first—year students
haven’t lived on their own
before. In fact, many students
are not from places half as
large as Oakland. This is where
a person’s discipline and priori-
ties shine through. Oakland
affords students the opportuni-
ty to experience many interest-
ing events from the theater and
the Carnegie Museum to local
bars and bands. There is some-
thing for everyone all the time.

Ilege means total freedom and total responsibility

off right about now. This is
where trouble begins. It’s not
that students stay out all night
or drink or any singular thing
which may cause them to miss
class, assignments, etc. because
we are all aware and can deal
with the consequences school
will impose provided we do
none of the above to excess.
The problem is that these situa-
tions without careful scrutiny
can lead to far worse things.

Always remember you’re in
a real city with real crime, real
criminals and real trouble. This
advice goes for everyone,
whether .you are from a city
larger than Pittsburgh, smaller
than Pittsburgh or from
Pittsburgh itself. Don’t take it
for granted or idealize it.

Use common sense and
remember what you were
always told (parents are older
and wiser). Don’t walk home
alone at night. Pitt provides a
shuttle bus to take students
around Oakland and the sur-
rounding area. Use it. You’re
paying for it whether you use it
or not.

Most importantly, don’t
drink to excess. Movies and
television continuously show
college students partying to
oblivion. They capture that
moment because it makes us
laugh, but also unfortunately
because it is a fairly common
occurrence on campuses across
America.

There is absolutely nothing
wrong with drinking. But when
you pass the point of total con-
trol you put not only others but
yourself at risk. Of course, the
obvious risk everyone faces 
drinking and driving. The
result can be fatal not only for
you but for a totally unin-
volved, innocent person. And
even if you’re lucky enough to
escape death, you face a crimi-
nal record, loss of your diver’s

, license and huge fines. So it’s

worth a second thought. Who
wants to spend years picking
up the shattered pieces of a life
destroyed in one night.

I think one thing many peo-
ple overlook when they begin
drinking is the personal jeop-
ardy they put themselves in. So
you’re not getting into a car,
how are you getting home? Are
you with a date? If you are not
in complete control of yourself,
you place yourself at great risk.
You risk being assaulted, from
being mugged to raped, on the
way home because you
become an easy target for
someone in full control of their
capacities.

Drinking to excess has many .

varying degrees of danger
associated with it and it isn’t
worth any risk. The conse-
quences may cause you to
spend a lot longer than four
years in college to pick up the
pieces. .

So these are the best years of
your life if you use your mind
(and that is what you came to
college to use, isn’t it.)

(from a

strictly non-
Columnist p r o p h e t

I.) Always

carry your Pitt ID. You’ll need
it to check out library books
and to be admitted into Trees
Hall.

An ID is also useful in other
situations, for example, the
local law folk may need it to
determine who you are if you
are hit by a Transit bus. (Mom
was right about looking both
ways on one—way streets).

2.) Turn your ID over and note
the strip of red tape. It repre-
sents the bureaucratic philoso-
phy of Pitt’s founders: “If it is
remotely important, we’ll
destroy it, lose it or give it to
someone who doesn’t care.
Check your mail for the bill.’7

Keep a copy of everything
you turn in for class. Keep two
of everything pertaining to
registration, bills and traffic
tickets.

3.) Do not travel in groups
larger than six persons.
According to Marlin Perkins,
the esteemed host of “Wild
Kingdom,” many animals trav-
el in groups for security pur-
poses.

This is entirely understand-
able, however, if» too many
Oaklanders are edged off side-
walks by compact hordes of
new students, they will likely
purchase tranquilizer guns and
use them with reckless glee.

Remember, stay in groups
smaller than six and larger
than two.

4.) Your roommate will either
own a python the diameter of a
space shuttle’s exhaust pipe, or
worse, he/she will have a sig-
nificant other who calls every
morning around 3 a.m. to
whine, “I missss yooou.” Be
patient.

Learning to live with some-
one you normally wouldn’t
pick to ask the time of could
be a tremendous character-
building experience.

5.) Beware of the take—home.
Many of you have yet to expe-
rience the take-home exam, a
test for which students are
encouraged to use notes and
texts to enhance the quality of
their work.

This format, however, is a
hollow, wooden gift horse
because professors tend to
expect intelligent and legible
results when they assign them.
How fair is that?

6.) Balance your time: If you
want to excel at Pitt you must
strive to achieve balance in
your life. Allow me to
rephrase that. If you want
to PASS so you can return

sort of balance between time 7.) Be moderate with food, 9_) wear your f1jp-f10p5 in
the showers, lest you contract
leprosy. And be prepared to
scald and freeze every time

you shower.

“An ID is also useful in other situations, for example, the local
law folk may need it to determine who you are if you are hit by

a Transit bus.” 10.) Bring a month’s worth of
music and magazines (or your
roomie’s python) to amuse
yourself while you wait in line

The spirit of rebellion has been
replaced by a cheap and use-
less counter—culture driven by
the will to overextend adoles-
cence and to make a fashion
statement.

If you think rebelling against
society is putting an earring in
your nose and dying your hair
blue, then you need to wake
up. If this is the way you
express yourself or define
yourself as an individual, your
“statement” is absorbed by the
mainstream, it becomes a fad
and eventually goes out of
style. Then you yourself will
go out of style because you
have tried to‘ find meaning in
something that is meaningless.
Actions speak louder than a
tattoo, so if you’re looking for
something to give the dark
void that is your life meaning,
don’t be a mushhead who just
goes along with the latest fad.
Don’t let other people dictate
to you that appearance is the
deciding factor of who you
are, be it the hat you wear, the
color of your skin or anything
else.

This is what happens when
you think the only option to
playing the game of economic
predestination dictated by the
white upper-middle class and
their brain—dead offspring ——
many of whom comprise what
has come to be known as
Generation X, a wasteland of

youths who have become soft,’

lazy and pathetically apathetic
as a result of their ultra-com-
fortable lifestyle — is to just
give up.

If you’re sick of being called
a slacker and being put down
by so—called adults who have a
lot of nerve criticizing another
generation when their. own has
created,this mess, the United
States, then don’t just stand
and stare as the country goes
down the toilet. Try doing
something that matters: Give it
up to the cause. I don’t mean

cock, I mean “Save the

beyond mere teenage angst,
it’s time to kill Generation X.
Otherwise, we will go down in
history as the generation of
sissies who let themselves be
pushed aroundgby the rest -of
the world.

If none of the above men-
tioned descriptions fit you,
then you need not take offense.
But if you’re one of those who
is content to just sit back. relax
and let your brains rot beneath
your baseball cap, you know
who you are, take heed,

, Real rebellion is more than
just a big fat middle finger
extended toward society. Real
rebellion cures the social ills

that have caused you to hide in _

a cloud of marijuana because
you’re afraid to face life. Real
rebellion takes the lazy, the
uncaring and the stupid, and
chews them up and spits them
out. It’s only a matter of time
until someone crashes the
party. What goes around, shall
come back —— stronger.

lot of stu-

dents could care less about
what happens within the uni-
versity or what project a stu-
dent organization is tackling.

So, maybe a lot of people are
taking 18 credits, a hard chem-
istry course and also have a
job. Academics are important,
but so is student involvement.
Achieving a great QPA is
beneficial in getting a job, but
I think experience and
involvement is equally benefi-
cial, especially when it’s your
first year of college. Getting
involved in an organization or
cause has numerous benefits.
If a job is between you and
another person with the same

QPA and no activities, it is
more likely you may get that
job if you were active in col-
lege since employers look for
leadership qualities.

As a freshman I became
involved in The Pitt News as a
news writer. Being a senior
now and looking back, I find
that I have gained journalism
experience, friends who I may
never have met, knowledge of
diverse subjects from covering
numerous stories, leadership
skills and contacts and refer-

help me find a job when I get

It’s not just the future job
aspect either, there is also a
social aspect. Joining an activ-

stress. Going to a meeting gets
you away for awhile from con-

Matt matter come
Serlin to think of
it. The point

is, what does one gain by par-

ticipating in clubs and activi-
ties at Pitt?

It has taken me three years to
formulate my answer to that
question, so ready or not here it
is.

In high school getting
involved in activities was a
means to an end. The Latin
Club looked real good on that
application, didn’t it? Well in
college what will the Latin
Club get you? As far as I can

tell nothing.

For the most part everyone at
this school is only a number
and the Latin Club is not going
to change that;

There are only a handful of
students at this school that
aren’t numbers and if you’re
not one of them you will
remain a number no matter
what club‘ or activity you join.

I am not advocating apathy
here. My point is that the clubs

and activities are not all what
they are cracked up to be. Sure
they may open doors for you
and get you recommendations,
but at what cost?

Aren’t there other ways to go
about getting experience for the
real world? Get an internship in
your field and you will get that
all—important recommendation.
It is not necessary to join an
organized club to get these
things. Take the initiative and

do things for yourself.

This school is basically a
large corporation that does not
recognize people as human
beings. The sooner you realize

that the better.

My roommate was known by
this university as four different
people. They mailed him things
in sets of four because they had
his name spelled four different
ways. They never stopped to

oming
f r o m
Phila-

Pittsburgh,
I assumed that
I would see
less crime.
I got a big
wake-up call
when I hit
the streets of Oakland for
the first time. Roaming around
Fifth and Forbes avenues
I realized crime was the
same or worse than back
home. ’

In my first week at Pitt, I
heard of a shooting that ended
in death, which happened
a block away from campus.
By the end of my fresh-
man year, I had been harassed
by bums, seen countless
robberies and had a gun point-
ed at my head. Some may
say in a city you have to

delphia to .

expect and accept it. Is this the
way college students have to
live?

I say that both the university
and city police should do more
to make campus safer. When
I was threatened with a gun
by a person in a car, naturally
I thought of calling the police.
The other person who was
in the car with me got the
license plate
and which direction he
was headed, and proceeded
to call the police within
two minutes of the accident.
Surely this would have been
enough for the police to appre-
hend the gun man. Right?
Wrong! My friend and I
waited 30 minutes in which
the gun man could have
came back and shot us both.
I can understand a 10-minute
delay,,but half an hour? I
look at the police blotter, and
it seems that the police

number _

are quicker to apprehend
someone who is mastur-
bating in a stall at‘ the
Cathedral, than a person
who threatened my life with a
gun.

These are not isolated
incidents, I have heard stories
similar to mine that could
have ended more tragically
because the police were
not there. I am by no means
saying it is the police forces’
fault. I say the city and univer-
sity have to hire more
police officers so incidents
like this don’t happen
again.

I feel that the university and
city police can do more to
make campus safer. For
instance, the police could keep
the beggars and burns off com-
munity streets.

The beggars and burns litter,
harass and make the Oakland
area look unappealing to

current and potential stu-
dents. I don’t want to have to

worry about dealing with a,

drunken bum harassing me
every time I go to a store in
Oakland.

The university also should
offer more information on
what precautions to take on
and off campus. T

They should make students
more aware of the programs
that Pitt offers in safety. For
instance, in using self-defense
weapons like mace. I have
seen and heard of people
macing themselves and inno-
cent people because they do
not know how to use it proper-
ly.

If you are coming to Pitt for
the first time, here are a few
suggestions on what to do to
be safer on campus.

1. Become aware of the sur-
roundings of Pitt, and learn

enls have the right to demand a safer campus

what places are usually safe
and what places usually are
not. -

2. Know where emergency
phones are on campus.

3. Walk with a friend when off
campus at night, especially in
an unfamiliar area.

4. When carrying mace or
another self defense weapon,
learn how and when to use it
properly.

On the whole we all can be
more aware of safety precau-
tions.

Also, we can lobby for
more lights around campus,
removing bums, more
patrolling and so on. We as

students have the right and the I

power to demand a safer cam-
pus.

The Pitt News, Monday, August 29, 1994

Competition motivates students to perform in class

ake a good look around
' I you. Whoever is sitting
on your right or whoev-
er is sitting on your left may
not be here two weeks from
now.” That is what one of my
professors said to the class on
the first day of the term, trying
to scare the weak-minded into
dropping his all-important
class. That is when some peo-
ple look around and say to
themselves: “I am the competi-
tion. It won’t be me who is
going to drop this class.” It is
at this time that other students
say to themselves nervously, “I
wonder if this class will be too
hard,” “I wonder if this class is
going to ruin my QPA even
more” or something like that.
Then they drop it out of pure
fear of hard work or because
they don’t believe they can
handle it. It is all about compe-
tition.

Are we all ready for the
competition that will ensue
from this day forward until the
end of the spring semester? I
imagine that some of us are,
and some of us aren’t. The
freshmen will soon be baptized
by their first exams, and they
will be thrust into the water of
competition either willingly or
unwillingly. It really doesn’t
matter, because the guy next to
you is willing. That is the atti-
tude that he takes. Whether or
not you are prepared, he is
going to give everything he
can to get the highest »‘5A”- in
the class, even if it means
going to the teacher and telling
him that you scored higher
than him because you cheated.
I’ll bet that each one of you
who reads this article has some
story about competition show-
ing either how you were raked
over the coals, or how you did
it to someone else. So before
continuing your reading, you
might want to reminisce a lit-
tle, just so you can ‘get a better
ﬂavor for my opinion.

In some classes, it becomes
like ABC’s Wide World of
Sports, with the thrill of victo-
ry and the agony of defeat.
When I was in my human
physiology class last year, my
friends and I used to compare
our test grades, and whoever
scored the lowest would have
to redeem himself in his
friend’s eyes. If we are not
comfortable with ourselves
and the knowledge that we
possess, the path to redemp-
tion, both personal and in the
eyes'of our peers, can be
fraught with pressure and anxi-
ety. Others see it as a chal-
lenge: Can I score better than
everyone else? People thrive
on this stuff.

Then come those people that
we all love to hate.-We know
who they are, and they are the
butt of many jokes. They are
the moochers, the people who
continually do no work and
expect you to hand all the
information to them on the day
before the test. Here’s some
advice: DON’T DO IT. They
probably wouldn’t do it for
you, and they don’t deserve it
anyway. They are just using

you to get ahead, and they
don’t care if you get kicked
out of the university for help-
ing them cheat or something to
that effect. Don’t risk it,
because it isn’t worth it.
Moochers are scum, and they
deserve to be treated as such.
What do you do if your friend
is a mooch? Your hands are
tied, because you are placed in
the position of either losing a
friendship or helping someone
out. Three years of college
experience tells me that my
real friends won’t do that, and
the people that are doing that
are just users to the maximum
degree. Watch out for these
people, because they’ll get the
“A” and you will kick yourself
for helping them, because you
scored lower than they did.
Not because you were less
knowledgeable than they were,
but because you were less pre-
pared. You spent your time
helping them on a concept that
you knew really well, but they
took your time that you would
have used to study the other
two concepts that were tested.
If you are the mooch, and most

of you out there know who
you are, shame on you. You
not only do yourself a disser-
vice by not learning the correct
way and ruining your reputa-
tion with people that will
become your colleagues in the
future, you do the others
around you disservice simply

‘ because they have to associate

with you.

Of course, if somebody who
you know is a hard worker
comes to you and asks for
help, don’t refuse. They may
be able to help you someday,
and it is a good way to stimu-
late good relations among you
and other class members.
Aside from the mooch, there is
an opposite — the person who
has that wealth of knowledge
and is not willing to share it
with anyone, in the name of
competition. His philosophy is
that if he can learn it, so can
everyone else. This is not an‘
incorrecttphilosophy, and I do
not condemn it. It is one per-
son’s prerogative to either save
or let drown. It would be nice
if he helped, but he has no
commitment to those of us that

    

”su\'V‘('

nti-Harassment Policy Statement

may be barely surviving in a
class. Hence, don’t blame him
(orpher, I’ve just realized that I
am not being politically cor-
rect, so from now on, all
him’s, he’s and anything that
denotes masculinity means
him/her, he/she and mascu-
line/feminine) for knowing his
stuff and not helping.
Ultimately, it is our responsi-
bility to learn the material and
compete with our ability, not
with someone else’s.

For those of us that are
applying to some type of grad-
uate school, whetherit is med-
ical school, law school or bas-
ket weaving, there is a whole
bunch of competition from
people we know and people
we don’t know. If my friend
and I are applying to med
school and he gets in before I
do, I will be happy for him. A
bit jealous, of course. That’s to
be expected. But don’t give
him hell about it. Be nice and
supportive, and say, “Hey,
great job _________ __” or
something corny like that,
when you really mean, “Jerk,
you got in and Ididn’t.” I

B-13

guess what I am trying to"say
is don’t be fake about it, just
enjoy it with your friend and
hopefully things will work out
for you.

Finally, I’d like to add some
tips on how to compete. This
is by no means a complete list,
and anyone who wishes to add
to it or call me an idiot, please
write back through the editori-
al section of The Pitt News at
434 in the William Pitt Union.

1. If somebody asks you
how easy the test was or what
your grade was, say, “I aced it
with no problem” or some-
thing like that, even if you
know you didn’t get one
answer correct. It is nobody’s
business but your own.

2. Don’t sit in the first row
in a lecture hall. Don’t be a
sycophant and think you are
going to get a better grade
because you are closer to the
teacher. A lot of the time you
just get heckled by your
friends for being a suck—up,
and the teacher starts to
believe it too. Trust me: I was
a freshman once.

tion, but you still want to be
active in some way, there is
the option of volunteering. Pitt
has a volunteer service,
Collegiate YMCA, the
University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, the Living-
At-Home Program as well as
many other causes in which to
participate.

All of the above organiza-
tions are just a few of what is
out in the university communi-
ty. If you want to find out
more, go to the Student
Activities’ Fair in Forbes
Quad or check out the student
directory. Go out, explore and
find something that you enjoy
and interests you.

Getting involved is definite-
ly rewarding. You’ll make
more friends, do something
you enjoy, get experience for
the future, make a difference
somewhere whether it be in
your personal life, university,
state or world,. get a break
from studying and maybe
learn something new.

consider the fact that maybe
there was only one person
going to college at that address.

As long as you pay your
tuition bills, the CEO (a.k.a.
Chancellor O’Connor) doesn’t
really care what you do while
you’re here. You could not
leave your room for four years
and it wouldn’t bother him at
all.

Come to think of it he wants
you to become involved
in every activity possible.
Why?

The more things you are
involved in, the less time you
have to do your work. And just
maybe, if he’s lucky, it might
take you more than four years
to graduate because of your
participation in so many activi-
ties. _

Now, think about it for a
minute. That means you will be

paying more money to this.

already financially secure insti-
tution. I know that sounds
insane, but things at this school

and formulated this plan to
keep students here longer, but
it’s fun to think about.

So don’t fall into the trap.
Don’t give them the satisfaction
of seeing you here for five
years. Let them know that you
don’t need the Latin Club to get
through college. Do your work
and hang out with your friends
during your spare time.

There are plenty of things
to do in the city of Pittsburgh
that you can find on your own.
The university supplies activi-
ties so you don’t have to dis-
cover other things, but prove
them wrong. Show them that
Pitt students are capable of
finding things to do on their
own.

You don’t need Pitt to hold
your hand. This is college and
you don’t need the Latin Club
to put on your resume.

Maybe I am just a pessimist,
but maybe that’s not so bad. At
least I’ll be out of here after my
four-year sentence. Glad it
wasn’t five.

3. Don’t say dumb things in
class. If you have a good
thought, let the class and the
professor know, but don’t say
something just to say it. If you
do that, you wind up looking
like an idiot and everyone
loses respect for you. Besides,
silence is ambiguous. People
won’t know if you are brain
dead or if you are thinking
that they are complete idiots
because they don’t know what
they are talking about.

4. Ask good questions that
are well-phrased and concise.
Most of the people in the class
will never get to know you,
and the only impression of
you that some of them will
receive is the manner in which
you inquire about information.
If you ask good questions,
people will respect you (they
may not like you, but who
cares when you are competing
with them) and so will your
teacher.

5. Don’t help mooches. That
is discussed above.

6. Read the material.
Nothing helps competition
like learning the knowledge
that you are supposed to learn.
That way, you won’t have to
rely on anyone else, and you
can just compete at your own
pace.

7. Be nice. Don’t throw a
higher score in somebody
else’s face. You come off
looking like a jerk, and they
know they have to work hard-
er to beat you, which means
you have to work harder to
stay on top.

8. Help your friends. They
will help you too. Again, this
is discussed above.

9. Take classes in which you
don’t need to be competitive.
You may be drained from tak-
ing five competitive classes,
and your fervor is expended
by midterms.

10. Don’t make excuses.
Realize what happened if you
scored poorly and analyze the
situation for the proper solu-
tion. That way, you don’t
delude yourself into thinking
that you should have done
better just because you are
you.

Friendly competition is a
good thing. It keeps people on
their toes. Just remember, if
you want to succeed, know
who your competition is. They
are the ones with whom you
will have to contend. Enjoy it,
and get used to it. It doesn’t
stop.

shows up way too often on
these “opinion” pages.

Cou1dn’t all of this catering

millions on these insulating

borhoods that surround it.
They seem only concerned
with maintaining the option to
swallow sections whole.

Sure, University Inc. isn’t in
the business of urban revital-
ization and any trip to East
Liberty or this city’s public
housing developments shows
us that more harm than good
can be done.

But how tough could it be to
be an active supporter of revi-
talizing the neighborhoods
still standing that surround the
university. Some amount of
hard cash would have to be
invested, but it seems the uni-
versity has a real stake in
helping to create and maintain
a kind of buffer zone around
the university. Within our own

institution lie academic
departments which deal
directly with urban

affairs/development and could
be used as resources for com-
munity development.

Maybe El Presidente and
his fellow real estate specula-
tors ought to return to
the business of a university,
which seems to be that
of serving its community with
educational and developmen-
tal resources instead of eyeing
up its surroundings as nothing
more than fodder for its
corporate—conglomerate
appetite.

Roommates

°From page B-4

In many instances, someone
would annoy the other or make
the other person angry and
the silent treatment began.
Pretty soon we would both
end up ignoring each other
and that’s'when everything
became worse. In my short
life of 21 years I have
found that one of the most
unpleasant things to do in life
is to live in the same room
with someone you are trying to
ignore.

After awhile, it gets so frus-
trating that every little thing
about the other person starts to
annoy you. (I can’t believe he
folds his socks that way!)

Roommates are like married
couples. They can live togeth-
er without communicating, but
it will usually end in divorce.
Roommates don’t have to be
best friends, and sometimes
being best friends can make
things worsen

Roommate conflicts contin-
ue throughout college life
from what I have been told.
Moving out of the dorms does
not solve everything which
brings me to another point,
money between roommates.

Moving into an apartment
produces lots of bills to split
and it’s not always amicable. It
can be if everyone compromis-
es.

Try living in an apartment
with someone who wants to
keep the heat on all the time
during the winter while you
can’t afford to pay the gas bill.
A compromise has to made
and communication will play a
part in that.

Of course, even communica-

tion will not fix every room-
mate conflict. Sometimes cer-
tain personalities just don’t
mix. —
My first roommate was a
slob. I am not exactly Felix
Unger, but I like to live in a
somewhat clean room, espe-
cially when I live in that one
room. —

He knew he was a slob and
he occasionally cleaned the
room just because I asked him
to do so. I don’t want to imag-
ine what the room would look
like if I hadn’t asked him to
clean it.

Another roommate of mine
had a vanity plate that said “So
sue me.” Although I am not a
fan of most lawyers, this was

just icing on the cake. He had

no consideration for anyone
else in the apartment.
Monopolizing the phone and
keeping everyone awake at
night while talking on the
phone were just a few of his
characteristics.

I am not spilling my guts
and spewing forth my opinions

to scare any new students.
Don’t be scared of what bad
things might happen, be excit-
ed for the good things that
might happen.

One of my best friends is my
roommate. It wasn’t always
that way, but with communica-
tion and consideration what’s
the worst that can happen?
You disagree. So what! Get
past it!

During your first year at Pitt,
you normally do not have a
choice with whom you can
room with. So why make the
rest of your life worse because
you don’t get along with your
roommate.

I have lived with three peo-
ple I didn’t know, two people I
did know, an ex-girlfriend and
three people I worked with.
Every relationship has had a
few thorns to go with the roses
and in some cases it was all
thorns.

It isn’t always perfect. I
know, because I am still
searching for the perfect room-
mate, but for some reason I
don’t think there is one.

about it, what makes other
schools so great is the
fact that the people who
attend that school have an
incredible amount of school
spirit.

If you have gone to a foot-
ball game at Pitt Stadium
in the past, you probably
noticed the opposing team’s
crowd outnumbers our
crowd.

That is not the way it is
supposed to be.

We as a student body have
the ability and the power
to make our university what
it is.

There are hundreds of
student organizations avail-
able to the student body,
capable of catering to the
many different tastes and
lifestyles we find in our stu-
dent body.

We alone control our
school’s destiny. We can
make it great, or we can
make it an average academic
institution.

The choice is ours.

Dorseﬂ runs to Canton

Dorsett, a former Pitt and

moving induction speech that
detailed his life and, ever the
one to meet a challenge,
attempted to do so without
allowing his emotions to
stream down his face.

“I know there are some bets
going over here.” Dorsett said,
referring to the collection of
quest Hall of Famers on hand,
‘‘I told you guys I wouldn’t do

Dorsett was born and raised
in Western Pennsylvania. He
said being in Canton was sort
of a “homecoming” for him,
having first journeyed from
Aliquippa to Pittsburgh and

then Dallas.

D_orsett’s father worked at
the J and L Steel Mill and the
family grew up in government
housing in the projects of
Aliquippa. Dorsett’s parents
wanted him to go to school in a

because it gave me a better per-

Dorsett said.

Dorsett spoke at length about
his parents. He spoke of how
his father was “a wealth of
knowledge” to him. He spoke
of how his mother was “the
backbone of the family.” He
also spoke of how his father
taught him to do things for
himself.

Dorsett took a long pause in
his speech when remarking on
his father, who has passed
away, and nearly surrendered
to his emotions.

However, the man who later
became known as TD collected
himself and said, ‘‘I ain’t gonna

“He was on an emotional
high that day,” Anthony

 Martin heads for second an all-time list

The Pitt News, Monday, August 29, 1994

Panthers’ sfarback finds solace in religion and rap along way

By Keith Pompey
Asst. Sports Editor

As the Panthers practiced on
a rainy day at the University of
Pittsburgh-Johnstown campus,
all eyes were on a senior run-
ning back who might go down
as the second best rusher in
school history.

With 2,361 career rushing
yards, all Curtis Martin needs
is 832 more yards tosurpass
former Dallas Cowboy running
back Curvin Richards, who is
second in school history with
3,192. Tony Dorsett owns the
record with an accumulated
6,526 yards at Pitt.

With a crowd of 50 or so
onlookers, Martin took a hand-
off from quarterback John
Ryan. He cut behind Reuben
Brown and scampered 30
yards, virtually untouched, for
atouchdown.

As the product of Allderdice
High School jogged back to the
huddle, it was evident this was
a bigger and stronger Martin.
In fact, Martin, who stands 6
feet tall, has gained 21 pounds
during the off-season, weigh-
ing in at a status 204 pounds.
His bench press went from 275
to an impressive 330 pounds.
And his 40-yard dash time
improved from a 4.5 to a 4.4.

 

“In the past what I would do
is go in the weight room and
do very little weight work and

make a living off of [football.]”
Martin is right, if things go
well this season he will be a

go outside and run stadium
steps,” Martin said. “I felt that
would be good enough at the
time because I didn’t come
from a weightlifting program
[in high school.] This year, I
stayed here all summer and did
a mad workout. I just worked
out all day. -
“I guess this was the first
year that it hit me [that I could]

shoe—in for playing on the next
level.

After accumulating a career-
high 1,075 yards on 210 car-
ries, averaging 5.1 yards a
carry, Martin has propelled
himself into the national spot-
light.

He is currently an All-
American and Doak Walker
Award candidate, and has

appeared on the cover of vari-
ous preseason college football
magazines.

But to the North Side native,
who only played one year of
football in high school, receiv-
ing awards is not among his
goals.

“I don’t have any goals of
winning the Doak Walker
Award or the Heisman, the
main thing I hope for is for the
team to do well,” Martin said.
“I am more of a team player.
I’m not the type of person who
will look out for myself only. I
have always been the type of
person who would look out for
others before I look out for

I myself.”

Assistant head/running backs
coach Charlie Coe added,
“[Curt] doesn’t set goals, he
doesn’t like goals. His only
goal is for us to win.

“But I personally set goals
for him.

“The big thing there is to
maintain the ball, don’t lay the
ball on the ground and every-
thing else will take care of
itself.”

Martin’s growth was not just
on the football field this sum-
mer.

“I’ve seen a lot of things
happen — shootings, people
getting killed, one of my fami-

ly member’s got killed,”
Martin said. “I know I’ve been
in situations where it could’ve
been me. But God opened my
eyes to that last year.

“I have never been the type
of person who would go to
church. I always had my little
relationship with God. I
thought that was good enough.
But it just so happened I went
[to church] one day and the
preacher just touched me by
what he was saying. It seemed
like everything he was saying
was related to my life.”

After being convinced by
what he heard from the preach-
er, he began to spread what he
learned to the rest of his team-
mates.

“Up at camp, we just had a
little Bible study with a lot of
the team members,” he said
with a smile on his face. “I
have also been bringing a lot of
them to church with me. I have
seen the effect that God can
have on someone’s life.”

Even though Martin has
toned down off the field, his
friends are still high profile.

Last year he was introduced
to rap stars Dr. Dre and Snoop

. Doggy Dogg.

On July 4, Martin accompa-
nied the duo at a party in Long

Nine football championships culminate Pitt sports tradition

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

Although Pitt athletics has
had its highs and lows when it
comes to winning throughout
the years, it still holds a list of

championships, All-
Americans, All-Big Easts,
Olympians and Hall of
Famers.

“I think of tradition [at Pitt,]
I think of winnings,” Chas
Bonasorte, owner of the Pitt
Stop and member of the 1976
national championship Pitt
football team, said. I

“You take a great-deal of
pride out of winning and pass
it on to the next team,” Oval
Jaynes, athletics director at
Pitt, said.

Pitt’s football team has won
nine national championships
over the past century.

According to Jaynes, win-
ning nine national champi-
onships places Pitt near the top
of the schools that have won
the most national champi-
onships.

“There are very few schools
that have won nine,” he said.

“Pitt’s tradition is there [in
football.] It hasn’t always been
grand or great. There have

been a lot of ups and downs,”
Sam Sciullo, assistant sports
information director, said.

“You look at a school like
Penn State, I think it has had
one losing season in the last 47
years. That’s a winning tradi-
tion. We have a tradition here,
people are interested in foot-
ball, people care, but it hasn’t
always been a success.” I

Sciullo said Pitt football had
some great teams throughout
the 1910s, ‘20s and ‘30s. The
‘40s, ‘50s and ‘60s were, for
the most part, down years with
the exception of a 9-1 season
in 1963. In the ‘70s, Johnny
Majors came and then Jackie
Sherrill, and they both had
great teams.

After Sherrill left, “it sort of
leveled off to mediocrity for
awhile and got even below that
point at the end of Paul
Hackett’s time here andthen a
change was made and hopeful-
ly we’ll get it back up to where
it needs to be,” Sciullo said.

Throughout the ups and
downs of Pitt football, many
players went on to play and
coach for the NFL.

Three Pitt players have been
inducted into the Pro Football
Hall of Fame — Joe Schmidt,

played for Dallas and Denver .

Other than wins and success-
ful players, Jaynes said walk-
ing up “Cardiac Hill” to Pitt
Stadium was a tradition for the
fans as well as the fraternities
and sororities running out on
the field to welcome the play-
ersand the band marching out
of the tunnel.

Pitt—West Virgini is a big
rivalry.

“West Virginia fans [being]
rowdy and vocal,” Sciullo said
is a big tradition to him. “The
signs in the windows along the
houses, ‘Beat the hell out of
Pitt,’ in Morgantown and stu-
dents yelling that. Just the feel-
ing, getting a knot in your
stomach driving into
Morgantown for a football or
basketball game.”

According to Sciullo, Pitt
basketball did not take off until
1982 when it joined the Big
East Conference.

Pitt later won consecutive
Big East titles in 1987 and
1988.

Currently, two former Pitt
players are in the NBA.

Charles Smith of the New
York Knicks and Eric Mobley,
who was drafted in the first
round by the Milwaukee
Bucks at the end of June. Doc
Harold Carlson, who coached
basketball between 1922 and
1953, was inducted into the
Basketball Hall of Fame.

Pitt’s women’s volleyball
team has won Big East tourna-
ment titles for the past six
years.

The men’s swimming and
diving team has won Big East
titles 11 out of the past 12
years and the women’s swim-
ming and diving team has won
nine Big East titles‘ out of the
past 12 years.

Pitt hosts the Big East swim-
ming and diving champi-
onships every year. .

“Whenever Pitt wins the
thing  the diving coach
Julian Krug  dives off the
high platform fully clothed,”
Sciullo said.

The men’s and women’s
track team won Big East titles
this past year, as well as a
number of the players earning
All—American honors.

Roger Kingdom, John
Woodruff, Vince Pickard, Herb
Douglas, Arnie Sowell, Bill

C-5

Rea and Najuma Fletcher are
on Pitt’s list of Olympians,
according to Steve Lewis, head
track coach.

“Tradition [of winning in the
past] is nice, it’s there, but it
doesn’t necessarily help you
win today,” Sciullo said.

Jaynes said when Majors
returned to Pitt he reestab-
lished a lot of fond memories
and tradition. He said Majors
is a coach that wants to keep
the tradition alive and the peo-
ple like him are people who
also set traditions. ,

“I think [Majors] is someone
who appreciates history and
would like to get back to that,
but I think he’s also a man of
his times too,” Sciullo said.
“He’s aware tradition can only
take you so far and is only
good for so much.”

As each year passes, this
university witnesses tradition
in the making. If football play-
er Curtis Martin has as good of
a year as last year, he will be
Pitt’s second all-time rusher.
Women’s volleyball is looking
for its seventh championship
in a row and men’s swimming
and diving and men’s and
women’s track are looking to
repeat as Big East champions.

 . . resounding
Columnist importance
Jack of the Pitt
Becker football

team’s sec-

ond season under head c_oach
Johnny Majors. Actually, this
is Majors’ second season of
his second stint as the Pitt
coach in a time when Curtis
Martin could become the
Panthers second all-time lead-
ing rusher.

A year of seconds, if you
will. Except, of course, if we
are talking about where Pitt is
projected to finish in the Big
East.

Nevertheless, this space was
designed to express where the
team is after two years of
sculpting under Majors.

It was to report the relative
quotes that revealed the make-
up of the team like when
Majors said, “We have an out-
standing attitude on this team
and it’s a 180 degrees different
from this time last year.”

It was to record the begin-
nings of what could be a criti-
cal season in the rebuilding
process because the majority
of the top, proven players are
seniors. .

But a plan does not always
go as intended.

Something happened.

People who had been around
the program for a few years
did not, at least for the time
being, seem to carry the same '
emphasis on the coming sea- -
son that those poking about for
answers did.

Steve Petro, a lifelong Pitt
man, had died of a; heart attack
a few days earlier. '

Petro spent his entire life
working at Pitt. First he played
football for Jock Sutherland
from 1936-38, which included
a victory in the Rose Bowl.
Next he coached as an assis-
tant with the Panthers for 22
years; He later ended his
career as Pitt’s assistant athlet-
ic director, a position held
from 1973 to 1984.

I Petro certainly had made
some friends at the university
during his time. People began
to exit the J ohnstown camp
left and right.

Play-by-play man Bill
Hillgrove was questioned as
he walked out the door‘ if he
was staying for the next day’s
practice.

“No,”'Hil1grove said. “Steve
Petro’s funeral.”

‘. Assistant Athletic Director
Larry Eldridge left camp early
as well.

“This one really hit me,”
Eldridge said.

The Big East preview: Miami tops list

The Pitt News evaluated the
talent in the Big East and used
our own prognostication skills
to come up with our preseason
Big East football poll.

. They’re back. After one of
the most disappointing years in
recent school history (9-3), the
Miami Hurricanes are expect-
ed to dominate the Big East.
Head coach Dennis Erickson
hopes his back-to-basics style
of play will give the four—time
national champions yet anoth-
er crown. With 48 lettermen
returning, including nine

starters on offense, these bad

boys from Coral Gables, Fla.
might have their way.

Frank Costa, a senior from

Philadelphia. will be looked

.‘ upon as the

' team leader.

X Costa, who

, started the

‘ first five

games last

season as the

quarterback,

completed 107 of 199 passes

for 1,324 yards and five TDs.

Costa came out of spring drills

as the starter. He beat out fan

MIAIW

favorite Ryan Collins, a quar-

‘terback, who doesn’t mind

straying from the pocket as he
completed 112 of 188 passes
for 1,555 yards and 14 TDs a
year ago.

The receiving end of Costa’s
passes consist of Chris T.
Jones, Marcus Wimberly and
Jammi German.

Look for Jones, an All-Big
East second team selection of
a year ago. to lead Miami in
receptions. Last year as a
junior, he led the club with 45
receptions and 700 yards.
Wimberly and German, a pair

of sophomores, will battle for
the other wideout spot. -
After gaining 542 yards on
93 carries and scoring five
TDs last year, James Steward
will get the bulk of work in the
‘Canes one-back offense.
Despite losing standout
defensive ends Kevin Patrick,
the Big East Defensive Player
of the Year, and all-league pick
Darren Krein, the ‘Canes see

this group of overachievers as ’

the surprise of college football.

to lead by example. Sapp, a 6-

sive tackle, registered 52 tack-
les and six sacks in 1993. For
his efforts he was an All-Big

back Glenn

Foley. Foley

” started a

45 games in

his standout career. This year’s

projected starter, sophomore

Mark Hartsell, has appeared in
five games.

Hartsell’s maturation should
be hurried along by an explo-
sive tandem in the receiving
corps. Senior tight end Pete

Mitchell, a unanimous first
team All-Big East selection,
led the league with 66 catches
for 818 yards last season. And
senior Clarence Cannon aver-
aged 18.6 yards per catch with
38 receptions.

Running chores will be han-
dled by senior David Green
(399 yards last season) and
senior Anthony Comer (391
yards, 6.7 yards per carry).

If it takes the BC offense
awhile to adjust to its’ new era,
the stingy BC defense should
provide an ample stopgap.

Stephen Boyd leads the experi-
enced BC defensive unit. Boyd
led the league with 161 tackles
at his inside slot.

Junior end Mike Mamula led
the league with 11 sacks last
year. He’ll be joined up front
by junior Chris Sullivan, a
third-year starter, and junior
Tim Morabito, a two—year
starter at nose guard.

All four starters in the BC
defensive backfield are back.
Seniors Joe Kamara and
Michael Reed, a second team

corners while junior Terence
Wiggins and Eric Shorter man
the free and strong safety posi-
tions, respectively.

As the Big East shifts its
spotlight from the quarterback
position to running backs this
year, Virginia Tech is the only
team with the luxury of match-
ing a Heisman—candidate quar-
terback with one of the confer-
ence’s deepest running games.

The departure of such pre-
miere quarterbacks as BC’s

G 1 e n n
Foley,
W e s t
Virginia’s
J a k e

Kelchner A

and Syracuse’s Marvin Graves
leaves Virgina Tech’s Maurice
DeShazo, an option quarter-

- back, as one of the most suc-

cessful and experienced QBs
in the East. DeShazo’s MVP
performance (19-33, 2 TDs) in
the Independence Bowl led the
Hokies to a 45-20 victory and
a No. 22 ranking in the final
polls. V

After a disappointing 2-8-1
1992 season, the Hokies’ bowl
victory and 9-3 record gave
Virginia Tech head coach
Frank Beamer one of the coun-
try’s best turnarounds, both
offensively and defensively. In
order to keep Tech surging,
however, Beamer will need to
rely on the offense, especially
the running backs, to shoulder
most of the load.

Junior Dwayne Thomas, a
1,100 yard rusher last year,
will start at tailback for the
Hokies looking to add to his 11
TDs in ‘93. “Touchdown
Tommy” Edwards, a sopho-

more, scored 10 TDs last year i

and will share the backup job
with senior Ranall White. At
fullback, sophomore Brian
Edmonds will take over the job
after gaining more than 300
yards as a freshman.

Rounding out the offensive‘

skill positions is senior receiv-
er and second team All-Big
East pick Antonio Freeman.
DeShazo’s favorite target.

Freeman caught a school
record nine TDs en route to
achieving a 20.1 yard average
per reception. Paired with
Freeman will be either sopho-

more Cornelius White or
junior Bryan Still, who both
caught 15 passes last season.

In order to keep this offen-
sive machine hitting on all
cylinders, Tech will need to
find a worthy replacement for
offensive lineman All-
American Jim Pyne.

On defense, the Hokies
return a fairly young line
anchored by sophomore
Cornell Brown at end.

Senior linebacker Ken
Brown, a second team All—Big
East pick, teams with junior
George DelRicco as the team’s
big stoppers. Both had over
100 tackles last year and will
be able to compensate for the
inexperience of sophomore
outside linebacker Brandon
Semones. L

The Tech secondary looks
young, but promising, with the
return of sophomore Antonio
Banks who had 44 tackles at
free safety and was the
Independence Bowl defensive
MVP. Sophomores Larry
Green and Torrian Gray, along
with junior William
Yarborough, look to become
starters this year after playing
part time in ‘93.

An undefeated 11-0 at the

national title. Don Nehlen’s
Mountaineers made some
noise, but fell short as they
were defeated in the Sugar
Bowl by Florida 41-7.

Can they duplicate l‘993’s
magical run-? With the loss of
27 seniors, and a schedule that
starts off with Nebraska and
ends with Syracuse, it’s highly
doubtful. There are holes
everywhere, but the biggest
void left to fill seems to be at
quarterback. The tandem of
Jake Kelchner and Darren
Studstill is no more as both
have graduated. That leaves
the load to sophomore Chad
Johnston who completed 10 of
13 passes last year. Fellow
sophomore Eric Boykin, a
transfer from Michigan, will
most likely be Johnston’s
backup.

Johnston’s main target will
be senior wide receiver Zach
Abraham who caught 10 pass-
es last season and will be
looked at to provide leader-
ship.

One area that graduation did
not seem to touch is the back-
field. The Mountaineers were

last year and were ninth
nationally as they racked up an
impressive 244 yards per
game. Leading the rushing
attack will be tailback Robert
Walker, who picked up 1,191
yards on 201 carries and
scored 11 touchdowns last
yean

The defense should still be
strong with six starters return-
ing. The defensive line will be
led by second team all—confer-
ence pick Barry Hawkins.

The linebacking corps is rel-
atively young with a number
of sophomores expecting to
see substantial playing time,
especially in the middle of
WVU’s 4-3 alignment. The
outside positions are strong as
senior Matt Taffoni, who made
63 tackles, will start at weak
side and Puppy Wright will
take the strong side spot.

The secondary appears to be
the strength of the defense as
all positions will be filled by
experienced players. Senior
safety David Mayfield, who
led the team with four inter-

ceptions and was second team
All—Big East, will lead this
group.

Nehlenjis the winningest
coach in the school's history.
He has taken his teams to eight
bowls and only twice have
they finished under .500. Look
for the Mountaineers to have
another winning season. But
with half the starters on both
sides of the ball lost, West
Virginia will not likely be able
to duplicate the magical run of
1993. '

— Brett Fondrk

The Syracuse Orangemen
would love to forget about last

_ year’s disaster ofa season, but

this year promises to be just as
bad, at best.

With the departure of
Marvin Graves, Kevin
Mitchell, Shelby Hill and Pat
O’Neill, the Orange now must
rely heavily on inexperienced
players to fill the gaps.

Offensively, senior Kevin
Mason takes over the quarter-
back duties. Completing only

seven of 17 passes last season
in extremely lim-
ited playing time,
it is not clear at
this point if
Mason is the man"
Y to run the
o ‘offense. If he

fails, look for
freshman Donovan McNabb to
replace him.iGiven Graves’
No. 5 jersey, it is clear the

UIIIVEIISIT
: 8 7

 

coaching staff expects great-V

ness from him in the future.

Kirby Dar Dar may win the
“Most Unique Name” award,
but must step up to become the
featured running back. After
Dar Dar there really are no
clear standouts. If he gets hurt,
the responsibility will fall on
either Malcolm Thomas or
Tebucky Jones.

The one offensive position
that looks solid is the receiving
core. Junior Marvin Harrison
showed signs last year that he
may end up being better than
Shelby Hill. Also there are
Will Walker and Jeyson
Wilson who will both have to

take some of the pressure off
Harrison. If they have some-
one who can get them the ball,
these receivers will be the stars

That is the belt.

But in preseason camp at
Johnstown the QBS were still
deadlocked.

ta . ihotographer

“At this point I don’t think I
want to say anything,” QB
coach Ken Karcher said with a
week left at camp. “They both
offer different qualities.”

“In the spring I felt I was
ahead,” Ryan, a junior, said,
“but when we were in camp,
coach told us we were even.”

Both QBs at camp rotated
between the first and second
units while the coaches looked
on with careful eyes.

Obviously, , Ryan and
Fitzgerald are different people
and each possess qualities the
other does not have.

The incumbent Ryan has
been there before. He knows
what to expect when a play
collapses and the defense
comes stampeding in.

“It helps,” Ryan said of his
experience. “I’ve been through
game situations and running
the offense. That’s really the
difference. When you’re in a
game, everything happens so
much quicker compared to
practice.”

“John was the starter, so
he’ll always have that,”
Fitzgerald said.

Experience is all fine and
good, but stats don’t lie. Ryan
threw more interceptions (6)
than touchdowns (8) last sea-
son. While starting l0 of 11
games, he threw for 1,284
yards, despite having consecu-
tive games of 50 yards or less.

On the other hand there is
the untested, but highly pro-
filed Fitzgerald, who is a
junior. As a sophomore at Los
Angeles Valley College last
year he threw for 3,134 yards
and 27 TDs in 11 games as he
emerged as one of the top 10
junior college quarterbacks in
the country. He attempted 398
passes with 10 interceptions.

In Fitzgerald’s first appear-
ance in the Blue—Gold game he
completed 15 of 20 passes for
134 yards and one TD, as he
led the Gold squad to victory.

“Coming in,‘ you always
think the incumbent has a leg
up,” Karcher said. “But after
spring football we felt Sean
did a good enough job that he
was even with John.”

“After the spring, there was
a lot of information coming in
about me,” Fitzgerald said.
“But the Blue-Gold game was
the first time anyone saw me.
It gave me a lot of confi-
dence.”

It’s not just Fitzgerald’s
numbers that makes him stand
out, it’s how well he moves for
his 6-foot-4-inch frame.

to deliver knockout blow

“Someone is going to step I

up and more than likely it’s
going to be Sean because he’s
very mobile,” tight end
Raymond Belvin said. “The
guys know that Sean is more
mobile. If we miss a block we
know that Sean can get out of
it. Sean is also a little bit taller
than John (6 feet 3 inches), so
he can see better over the
offensive line.

“John has been here for
awhile, but Sean is looking
good. That’s my opinion at this
time.”

Both quarterbacks have good
arms. There are no 300-pound
linemen rushing, so accuracy
is hard to determine.

Experience could be the only
thing Ryan has over
Fitzgerald.

“I don’t know if John has
anything that Sean doesn’t
have,” Karcher said.

Regardless of who wins the
starting job, both QBs are
under incredible scrutiny — by

the press, coaches and players.-

For the second year in a row

the QB controversy is the most ’

important development in
camp.

And no one knows it better
than Ryan.

“I felt a lot of pressure last
year,” Ryan said, “so I came
into this year with a different
attitude. I want to go out and
try to do my best and keep
improving. As long as I
improve on everything from
last year, whatever the out-
come is I’ll be happy.”

Stepping out of Martin's shadow

With improved QB situation and more speed, offense expands

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

through the damp air. A swift
receiver ﬂashes across the mid-
dle to snare the ball for a big
gain.

Unfortunately, this was only
practice, but unarguably Pitt’s
offense needs to see more of
this in 1994. Running back
Curtis Martin accounted for 60
percent of the 1993 team’s total
yardage. 2

This season the rest of the
offense is ready to step out of
Martin’s shadow and carry
their share of the load.

“He’ll get his 1,000, but this
year we have a lot more
weapons,” senior wide receiver
Billy Davis said.’ /

The main “weapon” appears
to be an extra year of experi-
ence under the young unit’s
belt. The Panthers will return
eight starters from last year’s
squad that averaged 15.3 points
a game.

“Last year, we had some
injuries that slowed us down.
We had some young receivers,

_ locked in a heated battle with
.. last year’s starter John Ryan.

, Ryan, who threw for, 1,284
yards with six "touchdown pass-
es in ll games, was in a simi-
lar situation last year when he
was forcedto beat out Ken
Ferguson, who has since trans-
ferred.

Fitzgerald is a highly touted
transfer from Los Angeles
Valley College where he set a
school record for yardage
(3,134) and touchdown passes
(27). He was rated as one of
the top 10 junior college quar-
terbacks in the country.

“Ryan and Fitzgerald have
shown that they are the two
guys to beat. They have the
most experience of the five
guys we have in camp. The
competition between the two is
very close,” offensive coordi-
nator Ken Karcher said.

“It is a battle to the very
end,” Davis said. “Everybody
knows the situation, but there
is no clear-cut favorite.”

One area that is for certain is
the backfield. Martin is an All-
American candidate who
rushed for 1,075 yards last sea-

Tackle Reuben Brown playfully sacks coach Tom Thrchetta.

and a new quarterback. This
year we have more experi-
enced guys and also quality
backups,” center Lawson
Mollica said.

In ‘94 the Panthers have/‘ thus
far avoided the injury bug, and
the young receivers, many who
have converted from track or
other positions, have begun to
mature. However, the Panthers
may once again have a new
quarterback. Junior college
transfer Sean Fitzgerald is

son and is considered one of
the premiere backs in the coun-
try. Sophomore Billy West,
who rushed for 108 yards
against Rutgers when Martin
was injured last year, will be
the backup.

The probable starter at full-
back is senior Chad Dukes.
Dukes started six games in ‘93
and racked up 143 yards on 25
carries. Vince Williams,
Maurice Washington and fresh-
man Chris Schneider may also

see some playing time as well.

“We are looking for someone
to 4 solidify this position,”
Karcher said. “Chad knows the
offense best. It’s very difficult
when a guy knows the system
for someone to beat him out.”

An area that seems to be
vastly improved is wide receiv-
er.

“It’s our personal goal this
season to increase our produc-
tivity,” Davis said. “We know
we have to take some of the
load off Curtis [Martin].”

“They have the potential to
be a great group,” Karcher
said. “They must perform con-
sistently, and thus far I’ve been
pleased with their progress.”

Dietrich Jells, who was red-
shirted last year with a knee
injury, will be the starter at
ﬂanker. Jells is considered one
of the better receivers in the
conference and his blazing
speed (4.43) makes him a
potential game-breaker.

The projected split end is
Davis. Davis started nine
games last year and hauled in
24 passes for 346 yards and
one touchdown. .

“He has always been a hard
worker,” Mollica said. “_But
I’ve really seen him step up at
camp. He has really
improved.”

The position is filled with
speed and a number of players
including Curtis Anderson,
Chad Askew, Jay Jones and
juco transfer Mark Butler
could see considerable playing
time.

Junior Ray Belvin, who
caught three passes as a part-
time starter last year, is the
starting tight end. He will be
backed up by Dell Seagraves,
who was converted from
defensive end.

“It is really a key position,”
Karcher said. “Belvin has the
edge because of his experi-
encef’

The offensive line will be

three-year starter, and Reuben
Brown, who is considered by
many to be one of the top
offensive linemen in the
nation. Matt Bloom, 6 feet 6
inches, 320 pounds, is a return-
ing starter at right tackle.
Junior Brian Curran and red-
shirt freshman Reggie Thomas
are the other probable starters
at guard.

“The line is definitely better
than last year,” Karcher said.
“Bloom is back, Mollica is
back, and you don’t needto
say much about Reuben
Brown.”

The biggest change from last

year in the offense is the expe-
rience factor. The team is a
year older-and many of the

young guys will be looked to
for contributions.

“We’ve made a lot of
progress since last fall,”
Karcher said. “We’ve upgraded
from last year in all positions,
but we need to continue to try
to improve.” ,

With a tough schedule that
includes six 1993 bowl teams,
the Panthers will be hard
pressed to improve on last
year’s win. total.

But despite the odds, the
players and coaches remain
upbeat.

“Everybody knows the
offense and each other this
year,” Dukes said. "I think
we’re gonna surprise some
people.”

Defensive line shuffling and transfers patch Panther defense

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

With most of the media
attention in Johnstown on the
quarterback controversy, and
who can lead Pitt to a winning
season, the players guarding
the other side of the ball for the
Panthers are quietly working to
insure Pitt’s leads do not disap-
pear.

The defense is returning a
familiar bunch + 10 starters,
23 lettermen —-— who have a
new look, according to defen-
sive coordinator Chuck
Driesbach.

“The players worked hard in
the off-season and have
become stronger and faster,”
Driesbach said. “We expect a

big improvement in the
defense.”

Junior lineman Mike Halapin
agreed.

“The whole team is working

Turchetta said he hopes the .

switch will keep Barndt, a
three-year starter, from draw-

‘ ing a double-team.

“Now Bamdt will be one—on-
one with a lineman and hope-
fully he’ll be a lot more suc-
cessful than he would have
been at tackle,” Turchetta said.

Driesbach said at this point,
returning starters Gerald
Simpson and Jason Chavis will
join 1993 All Big-East selec-
tion Tom Tumulty as starting
linebackers.

Tumulty, who led the team in
tackles last year, said the
defense has put last year
behind them, but is looking to
learn from the experience.

“I’m not concerned with the
pressure and things the media
might be saying. I’ve played a
lot and been somewhat suc-
cessful, so I’m just going to
keep improving on those
things,” Tumulty said.

together and playing a lot bet-
ter. Our lifts have increased
over last year and our times in
the 40 are also better.”

It is no secret, however,
increased speed and strength
will be a necessity if the
Panthers are to be successful
this year. After all, the majority
of this defense is returning
from a 1993 season in which
they surrendered, on average,
33 points per game along with
470 total yards.

“Last year was kind of tenta-
tive,” returning cornerback
Maurice Williams said. “Now
we know what the coaches
want and know we can perform
it.”

Driesbach said they will try
for different results using the
same 4-3 defense this year, a
defense in which several per-
sonnel switches have been
made since spring practice.

According to Driesbach,
Tom Barndt is taking over for

‘ Mike Mohring at right end,

who switches to left end. Notre
Dame transfer Tyler Young
will likely join Halapin as a
starting tackle.

Defensive line coach Tom

Tumulty, who listed as an
outside linebacker, said he is
on the outside only in name. In
the 4-3 defense he acts as the
middleman.

The biggest difference and
potential problem in Pitt’s
defense lies in the secondary,
partly due to the void left in the
wake of safety Doug Whaley’s
graduation. Whaley, the only
defensive starter not returning
to Pitt, led the secondary with
78 tackles last year.

“We lost a good player in
Whaley, but we have a high
quality returning safety in
[David] Sumner,” Driesbach
said. -

Sumner, a free safety, said
Whaley was the guy who made
sure everybody was in the right
place.

“Doug helped me a lot last
year,” Sumner said. “But now
I’ll have to be the ‘thinker’ of
the secondary and not just
worry about my job, but also
look out for others.”

According to Driesbach,
junior college transfer Daryl
Cash will probably start at
strong safety.

“We knew he could come in

here and do the job, that’s why

we recruited him,” Driesbach -

said.

Cash said he needs to make
some progress before the sea-
son opener to be a complete
player.

“I’ve got to stop making lit-
tle mistakes and read my keys
on tight ends and receivers,”
Cash said. “If I can do that and
make some big plays, I think
there’s a good chance I’ll
start.”

Williams and sophomore
Denorse Mosley, last year’s
starters, return as comerbacks.

“We have a better under-
standing this year of what the
coaches want, as far as lever-
age and angles,” Williams said.

In order for the defense to
turn around the statistics this
season, Driesbach said he’ll
look to the seniors and
Tumulty for leadership.

Turchetta said Barndt, a
senior, is a “coach’s dream” as
far as leadership goes.

“Barndt is more of a leader
by example than a ‘rah-rah’
type of guy,” Turchetta said.
“He’s not real vocal around
coaches, but when the ball is
snapped he explodes.”

Williams agreed it is Bamdt
and Tumulty who inspire him
in the midst of battle.

“They are so intense and
right in the middle things,”
Williams said, “you see them
bangin’ heads in the huddle
and it gets you fired up.”

Tumulty said he sees 11 lead-
ers on the playing field.

“If somebody is down, the
other 10 pick up the slack,”
Tumulty said. He said every-
body has a better feel for the
system because of their experi-
ence with it. i

In addition to knowing what
the coaches want, Tumulty said
the defense knows it needsto
be consistent.

“We want to have the same
people at the same places all
year,” Tumulty said. “By the
end of camp, we want to work
together like a single force on a
consistent basis.”

As much hope as there is for
consistency in camp, there
seems to be just as much talk
about depth.

“Last year, there wasn’t
much there after the first line,”
Halapin said. “Even though we
know the probable starters,
there is good competition for
every spot on the defense. We
deﬁnitely have greater depth.”

Jon McCray, Zatiti Moody,
Matt Hosilyk and Hayes Clark
are four players who have at
least two letters and will be
pushing for starting jobs on the
line and at linebacker all sea-
son. ,
The first test of the defense’s
consistency will be Sept. 3
when the Texas Longhorns
ramble into Pitt Stadium.

“It will be interesting,”
Sumner said. “They’ve been
mentioned as a top 20 team,

With so many players return-

advantage over other years.

Experienced sophomores kick off Pitt special teams

By Sean Duncan
Asst. Sports Editor

They are not the most
rewarding jobs, or the most
respected. The pressure is
immense but the notoriety is
nonexistent.

Experience for punters and
kickers is huge.

This season Pitt returns two
experienced
sophomores
to shore up
the special
teams unit.
Both punter
N a t e
Cochran and kicker Steve
Kalmanides won the starting
jobs as freshmen last season.

Cochran took over the start-
ing job in the fourth game last
season and never looked back.

His impressive 43.7 yards a

 

punt would have landed him in »

the top 10 in the nation and

second in the Big East if he_.

would have completed enough

games. Cochran’s longest punt’

was 70 yards.

“Nate is just learning what

punting is all about,” Steve
Bird, receivers/kickers co.ach,
said. “He’s doing really well
right now. If he keeps pro-
gressing he’s going to have a
real good year —— even better
than last season.

“I know what I can do,”
Cochran said. “I was a little

off in the beginning of camp,-

but I just found my swing-. I
feel like I’m on top of the
world.”

With a year under his belt, I

can have a future for himself,”
Bird said. “He’s only going to
get better. He has a lot of abili-
ty.”

It’s not just Cochran’s strong
leg that Bird likes, it is his
exceptional size and strength.
Cochran stands at 6 feet 4
inches and 210 pounds. He
looks more like a linebacker
than a punter.

“It’s a definite advantage,”
Cochran said of his size. “I
can tackle, I’m more versatile
and I’m pretty fast (4.7 40-
yard dash). It makes me a bet-
ter athlete, not just a punter

perse.”
Unlike Cochran’s monopoly
on the punting job,

Kalmanides, who started all ll
games a season ago, has some

, competition this year.

Senior walk-on David
Merrick, who transferred from
Marshall University, brought
impressive credentials to pre-
season camp. He was 19 for
25 in field goals, which tied
the school record and had a
long kick of 50 yards. 4

With all his numbers,
Merrick is probably best
known for the field goal he
never kicked. He missed prac-
tice two days before the 1992
Division I-AA championship
and was suspended from the
team.

Ironically, the game boiled

down to a 28-28 tie with 10
seconds left. Merrick’s broth-
er, Willy, who had never
kicked in a game before, hit
the game—winning 22-yard
field goal.

“I wouldn’t change that for
the world,” Merrick said. “As
a senior, my brother kicking
the game winner for the
national championship —— it
was awesome.”

Now, Merrick is battling for
the No. 1 job at Pitt.

“Merrick is really pushing
Steve Kalmanides,” Bird said.
“He’s got an incredibly strong
leg.”

“Dave makes me pickit up a
little,’’ Kalmanides said. “He’s
a good kicker and makes me
keep .on my toes. He makes
sure I don’t screw around so I
don’t lose my job.

“I didn’t have that [competi-
tion] last year. It was more laid
back. It’s good to have compe-
tition because it makes you
play better.” '

Lucky Seven

Alvear and co. aim to continue Big East volleyball dynasty

By Sean Duncan
Asst. Sports Editor

There are several words that
describe the Pitt volleyball
team. _

Success. The Panthers have
won six Big East titles in a
row and are gunning for the
seventh this season.

Depth. They have nine out
of 11 players returning from
last year.

Talent. With the addition of
transfer setter Stephanie
Dufresne from the Univer-
sity of
Toronto
to add
to the
returning
nucleus
of last
year, the
Panthers

 

look to be stronger. M

But the one word that comes
to head coach Cindy Alvear’s
mind is “if.” i

“There are a couple of big
ifs,” Alvear, who was former-
ly known as Cindy Braziel,
said of the upcoming season.
“We are coming into the pre-
season with some injuries.”

Carrie Thornton, a fifth year
senior, and obviously the most
experienced on the team, just

had arthroscopic surgery on
her knee. Fortunately,
Thornton said, the surgery was
minor and she is only expect-
ed to miss two to four weeks.

“She’s one of our better ball
handlers,” Alvear said. “She
handles the ball real well
which is a key to our offense.
It was an unexpected loss.”

Also, first-team Big East
setter Annemarie Mernagh is
questionable for the start of
the season. She had a stress
fracture last spring and is still
recuperating. Laura Horvath
has a bad shoulder and she is
questionable.

“So when you say how good
we are going to be, it all
depends on how well we’re
going to heal,” Alvear said. “If
we’re healthy, we are going to
be great. If we are partly
healthy, we should be very,
very good.”

Although the Panthers have
nine returning players, Alvear
projects there will probably-be
four or five new position play-
ers due to injuries.

. One of those new players
will probably be sophomore
Dufresne. The 5-foot-l0-inch
setter will add versatility to
the Panthers’ line—up. _

“She’s 5-10, so she can

block the first attacker to the

net,” Alvear said. “She also
has international experience.
She was asked to try out for
the Canadian National Team.
She has a lot of savvy. She’s
going to help our team one
way or another.”

The only other new player is

walk-on freshman Jenny

Maguire.

But the impending question
for this team is can the
Panthers patch the loss of Ann
Marie Lucanie, who was the
Big East Player of the Year
and the only All—American in
conference history.

“It’s interesting,” Alvear
said. “A great player can
never be replaced physically.
But I feel very strongly that
our team’s chemistry will be
much better this year because
each girl will feel that they are
more vital to the success of

A the program.

, “And anytime you have that
feeling, they will play better
as a team. The other teams
will have a harder time stop-
ping us because the wealth is
spread, opposed to having it
centralized in one area.

“Each individual girl got 5
to 10 percent better over the
summer,” she added. “Either
they dropped weight, got
stronger or played over the

The Pitt News, Monday, August 29, 1994

summer. If we have 10 or 11
players getting better, that

 

means we are 100 percent bet-

ter as a team.”
Thornton agrees.

Luccmie

he
Lady
Panth-

ers volleyball
team has qui-
etly won the

 

last six Big

East crowns.
Columnist But the ques-
Keith tion making
Pompey noise around

the confer-

ence this year is can the Lady
Panthers win seven in a row?

According to assistant coach
Brian Begor, it will be a piece
of cake.

“We returned everybody but
one player off of last year’s
team,” Begor said. “We have
eight or nine people on our
roster who have won two or
three conference champi-
onships. I think that kind of
experience is invaluable.

"‘Every team we play does
not have one player who has
won a conference champi-
onship.”

That all sounds fine and
good, but who the hell is going
to take Ann Marie Lucanie’s

'1 place? Throughout her career

at Pitt, Lucanie became the
greatest volleyball player to
ever play in the conference.

The Canadian superstar was
only a four—time Big East
Tournament MVP who ended
her illustrious career as a sec-
ond team All—American. That
made her the first All-
American in Big East history.
A player with these credentials
should be missed at any insti-
tution.

But according to Begor, Pitt
will be a far better team with-
out Lucanie.

“She was MVP of the con-
ference all four years she was
here, but I also think we have
some significant additions this
year,” he said." ’

“Last year, we were a solid
team with one exceptionally
talented player. This year’s
team will share the load that
Ann Marie carried last year. I
don’t think one person is going
to step up and pick up
[Lucanie’s] kind of numbers.
Everybody will share that.”

In order for Pitt to win again I

this year, they will have to
play perfect volleyball. To do
that, someone must step up
and assume the role that
Lucanie has left vacant.

Annemarie Memagh and
Jennie Driscoll are both quali-
fied for the job.

Memagh, a 5—foot-8-inch
senior from Portage, Mich.,
will continue where she left
off. Memagh, a first team All-
Big East Conference setter last
season, led Pitt with 1,499
assists. Carrie Thorton was

Win and you’re in, lose and
you’re out. That’s what the
Panthers 1993 soccer season
had come down to as they
faced Georgetown with a play-
off berth on the line.

In the swirling snow at Pitt
Stadium the Hoyas prevailed
and Pitt was left with a win-
ning season, but an empty feel-
ing.

“It was a good year, but it
wasn’t what we wanted,” soc-
cer coach Joe Luxbacher said
as he described the Panthers
1993 season.

The “good” year that
Luxbacher spoke of translates
into nine wins and five losses
with the team just missing the
playoffs as ’ they fell to
Georgetown 3-1. But this kind
of season comes on the heels
of a 1992 campaign that saw
Pitt win a school record 12
games, finish second in the
Big East and qualify for the

conference postseason tourna-
ment. To say the Panthers were
disappointed would be an
understatement. .
“The Georgetown loss took
the wind out of our sails,”
Luxbacher said. “It would
have been a great year if we
had beaten them.” The loss left
the Panthers out of the playoffs
and unable to achieve the suc-
cess of the previous season.
But Luxbacher said this sea-
son will be different. “The
b i g g e st
change in
the team
that I see
from last
year is
t h e
change in
attitude
and expectations,” he said.
“This year the players expect
to be one of the better teams.”
The Panthers have nine let-
termen returning with leader-
ship coming from a talented
group of seniors including

 

Bobby Dyer, Eric Prex and
Chuck Wasson, who have been
named tri-captains. ‘

The most important player
out of that group is Prex, who
was the leading scorer in 1991
and 1992. He was the fourth
leading scorer last season with
12 points despite the fact that
he played the entire 1993 sea-
son in a protective cast after he
suffered a broken arm in pre-
season workouts. Pitt hopes
that he returns to his 1992
form in which he amassed 28
points and was named to the
All-Mid Atlantic region team.

“Eric is ready,” Luxbacher
said. “He never made any
excuses last year. He’s worked
hard in the off-season to make
himself a complete player, not
just a scorer.”

Wasson, a midfielder, is a
leader by example. He is
described by Luxbacher as a
“coach’s dream” who always
gives 100 percent.

“If I had 11 Chuck Wassons,
I would be in good shape,”

C-17

Luxbacher said.

Dyer is the top defender who
started all 16 games last year
and will be the anchor of the
Panther defense.

Another player that will be
counted on to provide scoring
punch is junior midﬁelder Jeff
Porter. Porter is Pitt’s top
returning scorer from last sea-
son when he had l8 points
including three game—winning
goals.

An area of the team that is
particularly strong is in the net.
Luxbacher has the luxury of
having two top goaltenders in
senior Kirk Brodows and
junior Adam Spitzer.

Spitzer, who tied a school
record for shutouts with 10 in
1992, was the starting goalie at
the beginning of the season.
Brodows stepped in when the
Panthers struggled early on
and ended up 7-3-2 including
two shutouts.

The battle for the starting
position appears to be wide

No sporting event demanded
more attention. this summer
than the World Cup. And few
developments in that tourna-
ment were as closely followed
as the play of U.S. goalie Tony
Meola. .

Likewise, for the Pitt soccer
team, no development will be
as closely scrutinized by head
coach Joe Luxbacher in pre-
season workouts as the play of
the Pitt goalies.

Two men are shooting for
the position that Meola has
suddenly made glamorous.
Luxbacher is hoping one man
steps to the fore.

“That is going to be a critical
position,” Luxbacher said.
“Whoever ends up doing the
job, they have to do the job.”

The two goalies fighting to
become the Pitt starter are
senior Kirk Brodows and
junior Adam Spitzer.

most of the season last year,
guiding the team to a 9-5-3
record and within a game of
qualifying for its second
straight Big East tournament.
Brodows was in goal for seven
of the nine wins in 1993. He
notched 69 saves and allowed
under a goal per game (0.96
average).

Spitzer was the freshman
starter in 1992 when the soccer
team attained the best record,
l2-6-‘l, in Pitt history. At sea-
son’s end, he was honored as
the Big East Rookie of the
Year. ,

“It’s a mixed blessing to
have two players that are
equally talented,” goaltenders
coach Dave Torrence said.
“We are fortunate to be in this
position.”

Last year Spitzer had won
the job in the preseason, but
after a 0-2-2 start he was
replaced —— essentially for the
season — by Brodows in game
four.

had a great game and sort of
latched on to the position,”
Luxbacher said.

That was not the first time
the two have jockeyed forthe
starting spot. It has nearly
become an annual situation on
the team.

In 1992, Brodows, who had
earned the starting role, was
replaced by Spitzer in game
two , against Bucknell. Spitzer
held the job from that point "on.

“They’re both very capable,

both can be outstanding goal- ,

tenders,’ Luxbacher said.
“Adam was one of the top

' keepers in the Big East two

years ago. Then Kirk was one

_ of the top four last year. They

both have the ability. They do
it different ways.”

Brodows and Spitzer are a
contrast in styles.,Torrence
describes Spitzer as a more
polished and fluid player.
Brodows is considered more
aggressive and vocal. Torrence
said Spitzer is better at defend-
ing in the air, while Brodows
is stronger at diving for a ball.

Torrence also said both play-
ers’ positioning and control of
the box is relatively equal.

“They’re two different per-
sonalities,” Luxbacher said. “It
would be nice to combine
them both into one.” ‘

Luxbacher wants to see
one or the other stand up and
grasp the starting job. The Pitt
coach does not prefer to rotate
his goalies from game to
game.

“It’s sort of a position that
you like to get a guy that gets
in a groove and knows it’s his.
I don’t want either of them
worrying if they make a mis-
take, then [they’re] out,”
Luxbacher said.

“I’ve never been a fan of
splitting time,” Torrence
added.

However, if neither Brodows
nor Spitzer were able to lay
claim as the team’s net minder,

Cross country bolts into 1994 season in full stride

Lewis ready
to compete
in "best
conference
in the wor/

TT

By David Saliba
Staff Writer

The beginning of a new
school year brings out vigor-
ous emotions of anticipation.
The month of August is syn-
onymous with the start of foot-
ball, but for the sport enthusi-
ast it is also the beginning of
the track season. Cross country
season to be exact.

It is the high emotions of
excitement that fuel the antici-

pation of Pitt
T track head
R coach Steve
A Lewis, who
C begins his
K first season

?"#’ running the
entire track and field program.

The first test for Lewis will
be the cross country season
which officially begins Sept.
10 at Kent State University,
Ohio.

For Lewis, cross country is
not something to take lightly.

“We plan to be serious in
cross country, competitive
with anybody in the East,”
Lewis said.

According to Lewis, it is ’

impossible to predict how the
Panthers will contend in the
Big East Conference.

“I don’t think anybody in" the
country can predict, [who will
contend for the Big East

Conference Championship] ,

because the Big East
Conference Championship in
cross country is in fact beyond
a doubt with no question hands
up, down or sideways the
toughest and best in the
world,” Lewis said.

Although this may be true,
distance coach Mark Schwartz
will base the goals for this year
after last year’s finish.

“Last year the team finished
tied for third place with
Connecticut,” Schwartz said.
“As a team we want to main-

 

NFL 4 on 4 Flag

Valley. (431-4431)

tain that or do better.”

As a team, men and women
combined, it will have 90 per-
cent ofjits runners returning.
For the team as a whole, it is
not yet totally committed to
distance running, Lewis said.

“Teams that have perennially
been in the top-five in the con-
ference are teams that have
committed themselves 100
percent to distance running,”
Lewis said.

According to Lewis, the
teams which have been the top
teams every year, both men
and women, for the last 10
years are Providence,
Villanova and Georgetown.

Yet the enthusiasm of Lewis
and staff remains the same
despite the three Big East pow-
erhouses.

“We are going to approach
this year with the attitude that
we are going to be Big East
champions,” Lewis said. “That
means for indoor, outdoor and
cross country.”

For this to occur, the

Panthers will need to turn to
certain athletes for leadership.

“[Cross country] is a team
sport, but it is really an indi-
vidual sport with a team
aspect,” Schwartz said. “I
think the emphasis at this point
is going to be on the individual
with that team aspect behind
it.”

The individuals that
Schwartz and Lewis will turn
to for the men’s team are
seniors Frank Nesko and Mike
Umbleby. .

“We not only expect them to
be leaders and carry the team,
but we feel they have the capa-
bility to do so,” Lewis said.
“They have the talent and they
will be motivated, which is the
biggest factor.”

For Schwartz, who enters his‘
first year as a coach at Pitt, he
has yet to meet with either
team though he feels confident
about the men.

“I would say that the men
are going to continue to
improve as a team and we

have some individuals [Nesko
and Umbleby] who will strive
to do well,” Schwartz said.
“Depth is essential in having a
good team.”

The men’s team has some
depth in returning underclass-
men as well as three hopeful
freshmen.

“In the junior class we have
Dennis Kuntz and Matt
Clarkson,” Lewis said.

“A definite supporting factor
will be sophomore Ed
Adamson and our three
recruits [Scott Curry, Rich
Walsh and Ryan Buckley],”
Lewis said.

As for the women, they are
young and somewhat inexperi-
enced, Schwartz said.

According to Lewis, the
women are in an odd position
of being both the old and
young of the team.

“The women are all return-
ing,” Lewis said. “But, they
are old and young at the same
time. The oldest one on that
group is Melanie Ishman and

C-19

she’ll be coming in as a
junior.” "

The youth of the women is
evident, but the talent runs
deep.

“Our number one runner last
year was a freshman, Angie
Martin. Our number two run-
ner for the most-part was
Stephanie Ellsworth. Both
return this year as sopho-
mores,” Lewis said. “The
women are young.”

“We are going to develop
them, get them to do the best
they can, to become the best
they can be,” Schwartz said.
“Distance running is a sport
where a lot of it is hard work.
A lot of it is being intelligent,
and running smart,” Schwartz
said. “We are going to incor-
porate those aspects into the
program.”

Work ethic is a major part of
the philosophy of Lewis’ staff.
They are eager and determined
to start what will hopefully
become a successful first sea-
son together.

Having never kicked in a col-
legiate game, Syracuse fans
will be holding their breath
when he steps out on the field.

This season figures to be a
rebuilding year for the Orange.
They have numerous players
who have little or no game
experience, and this entire sea-
son will be a test of their play-
ing ability.

— Matt Serlin

Pitt should be a much
improved team this season, but
whether that translates into a
few more chalk marks in the
win column remains to be
seen. Head coach Johnny
Majors benefits with the expe-
rience of 18 returning starters.
The problem is that those
starters experienced a brutal 3-
8 record.

Nevertheless, the Panthers
should be more competitive
this time around. At the least
managing to avoid the shutout
performances they experienced

College and
Notre Dame
( p a r t l y
because ND
is not on the
schedule).
At its best,
Pitt could scare a few teams as
it did last year, coming up two
yards shy of shocking
Syracuse.

The question mark at this
point is the quarterback posi-
tion. Junior college transfer
Sean Fitzgerald is making a
strong push for incumbent
John Ryan’s starting spot.

The offensive line will be
better prepared to protect its

 

QB with Outland Trophy can- ,

didate Reuben Brown return-
ing for his senior season.
Seniors Matt Bloom and
Lawson Mollica will join
Brown as the nucleus of men
that will open holes for All-
American running back candi-
date Curtis Martin.

Martin, with another 1,000-

yard season, could become
Pitt’s second all—time leading
rusher.

Dietrich Jells, if healthy,
returns as Pitt’s deep threat
receiver. Billy Davis should
play opposite Jells.

The defense returns 10
starters led by a healthy Tom
Tumulty. Tumulty tied for sec-
ond in the Big East last year
with 113 tackles, despite play-
ing with one arm in a cast.
Gerald Simpson, Jon McCray
and Hayes Clark all figure to
contribute at linebacker as
well.

Senior Tom Bamdt, who led
the team withseven sacks a
year ago, looks to shore up one
side of the defensive line while
Notre Dame transfer Tyler
Young has forged his way into
a spot at tackle.

Second team All—Big East
pick Maurice Williams,
Denorse Mosely and David
Sumner all return in the sec-
ondary. The fourth D—back
position is wide open.

The Panthers are capable of
winning a game or two more
than they did last year, as they
aim to take larger strides in the
program’s rebuilding process.

Their high-powered attack is
led by ‘the tailback tandem oi
sophomore Terrell Willis and
junior Bruce Presley, the last
two Big East Rookies of the
Year. Willis was second in the
nation in all-purpose yards
with an average of 184.2. He
led the Big East in rushing and
was 10th nationally, picking up
1,292 yards on 195 carries and
ran for 13 touchdowns.

Presley, who missed two
games because of an injury,
gained 755 yards on 126 car-
ries. Wes Bridges looks to be
the leader at the fullback posi-
tion.

The running game will be
more of the focus after RU lost
the trio receiving core of Chris
Brantley, Mario Henry and
Lance Evina. They caught 86
passes for 997 yards. Seldom-
used junior Eddie Walker (12-
175) will have to step up.

Junior Ray Lucas, who
shared the starting quarterback
job for the past two seasons, is
now» the No. 1 signal-caller for
the Scarlet Knights. Last year
he completed 109 of. 188
attempts for 1,011 yards.

Because of RU’s crumbling
defense, head coach Doug
Graber switched his 4-3 defen-
sive scheme to a 3-4. This will
hopefully alleviate some pres-
sure off the almost nonexistent
secondary which was wrecked
by injuries last year.

Another reason for Graber’s
switch is because of his solid

defensive line. Senior Keii ’

Bryant (6 feet four inches, 275
pounds) anchors the group at
tackle. Senior Bob Sneathen,
who made the switch from out-
side linebacker to defensive
end, had a team-high six sacks
last year.

The enlarged, refurbished
Rutgers Stadium will fill up
because of RU’s high-powered
offense, but the punchless
defense will probably land the
Scarlet Knights close to the
cellar  again.

There is an old adage that
says, offense wins games, but
defense wins championships.

Although the Temple Owls
are far from championship sta-
tus in the Big East it is their
defense that will be the bright
spot in what appears to be
another dismal season.

“I think at the quarterback
position you’re going to feel
pressure no matter what,”
Fitzgerald said. “There’s a lot
of talent here, so it’s just up to
the coaches.”

Despite the battle for No. 1,
they managed to keep the ﬁght
to a friendly sparring.

“I like Sean and he likes me
I think. We’re not out for
blood,” Ryan said._

“There’s no friction between
us,” Fitzgerald added. “It’s not
like we don’t get along.”

Ryan put the quarterback sit-
uation into perspective, realiz-
ing the pressure is on him.

“Right now we’re even,” he
said. “The thing is we are both

Heavy rains forced Pitt to
move operations deep into the
heart of Penn State territory at
a turf field in Altoona. Majors
arrived late, midway through
the afternoon practice.

Fresh off having attended
services at St. Paul’s Cathedral
in Pittsburgh, Majors trudged
through the routine questions
from story hunters. When the
television cameras shut down
and the tape recorders turned
off, the Pitt coach turned to a
reporter and asked, “Do you
know Steve Petro?”

“Terrible loss,” Majors
added quickly.

In one fell swoop Majors
made very clear what was
important to him at the
moment and put the whole
scope of the season into per-
spective. 7

A report on Petro, issued to
the press, contained a quote
from Majors. It said,.“We have
lost oneof the best men that I
have ever known.”

Majors, it should be noted,
has known many men.

The 5—foot—l l-inch terror,
Driscoll, is due for another
good year. Last season, as a
freshman, she led the confer-
ence in hitting percentage
(34.8) and was second on the
team with 2.7 kills per game. ‘

Pitt has the talent to win its
seventh Big East title this year,
but without Lucanie it won’t
be any easier. But the real
question is  even if they win
another Big East title, how are
they going to get past the first
round in the NCAA
Tournament without Lucanie
if they could not do it with
her?

open. Luxbacher said he has
no idea when a starter will be
named and both players have a
legitimate shot.

“They have very different
styles,” he said. “Adam is
smooth and fluid, and Kirk is
more high energy and vocal.”

“This is going to be a critical
position,” he said. “The team
plays much more confident
with solid goalkeeping.”

The team will also be
strengthened with the addition
of freshman Jason Piombino.
Piombino was a four-year
starter and captain at Great

Valley High School. He was
the 14th ranked senior in the
country, according to Umbro,
and was ranked first in the
final Southeastern
Pennsylvania Soccer Coaches’
Most Valuable Player poll.

“He is a tough, versatile
player,” Luxbacher said.
“He’ll pressure some people in
the back for a spot.”

Luxbacher said the team is
looking forward to the season
opener Sept. 4 against
Bucknellﬁ

“We hope we can get off on
the right track and go from
there,” Luxbacher said.

Luxbacher might not hesitate

to inject his untested third-

stringer, C. J. Tadesco, into the
lineup. Although, for now,
Tadesco remains the No. 3
goalie.

sive line.

The secondary will be led by
junior cornerback Robert
McWilliams.

An example of the inexperi-
ence of the Owls, as well as
their lack of depth, is the pos-
sibility of walk-on Phil Cox or
junior college transfer Alan
Jackson starting at corner
opposite McWilliams.

This lack of talent as well as
experience will cause prob-
lems for second-year head
coach Ron Dickerson, but it
will be his offense that will
prove to be disastrous.

The foundation of. the
Temple offensive line will be
absent this year. Tre Johnson, a
second-round NFL draftee,
and three—year starter Glenn
Tinner have graduated. Of the

C-21

five linemen, only two willb
returning starters. ‘

For sophomore quarterback
Henry Burris, it will be anoth-
er long year. He will have to
depend on senior receiver Jeff
Frederick and sophomore
Randy Canzater to open up the
running game, and take pres-
sure off himself.

As the linebackers provide
strength on defense for the
Owls, the running backs sup-
ply stability to a thin offense.
With all lettermen returning,
senior Ralphiel Mack and Sid
Morse will split time at full-
back, while -sophomore Danny
Davis returns at halfback.

The Owls are a very young
team with approximately two-
thirds of the squad being fresh-
men and sophomores.

Phi Beta Kappa Honor Society  

  Announcement to Freshman    
New Eligibility Requirements for Election to Phi Beta Kappa

The Phi Beta Kappa Society is the national honorary society for students in the liberal arts
and sciences. Founded in 1776, the Society has chapters only at the leading academic
institutions in the United States. Election to membership in the Society is regarded by many
as the most prestigious honor which can be conferred upon students majoring in one of the
liberal arts and sciences.

For those students entering the College of Arts and Sciences in the Fall term of 1994-95 the
minimum eligibility requirements have been changed. The new requirements are as follows:

 

1. Completion of the second collegiate year of a
foreign language (level four or equivalent) or
completion of four years of secondary school
instruction intone foreign language.

2. Completion of at least 15 credits of course work
with letter grades in both the Humanities Division
and the Social Sciences Division of the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences. These 15 credits must include a
minimum of eight credits in a single department and
at least three credits in each of the two other
departments of each division.

3. Completion of at least l5 credits of course work
with letter grades in the Natural Sciences Division
of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The 15 credits
must include: _

(a) A minimum of three credits in mathematics
courses beyond algebra and trigonometry (i.e.
calculus, introduction to mathematics, or mathematical
statistics); ,

(b) A minimum of six credits in a two-term
sequence in courses in the Departments of Biological
Sciences, Chemistry, or Physics and Astronomy; and

(c) An additional six credits in courses in any
other department in the Division of Natural Sciences,
including the Department of Neuroscience, the
Department of Computer Science, the Department of
Geology and Planetary Science, and the Department of
Psychology.

4. Completion of a minimum of 15 additional
credits of liberal arts course work with letter grades
from the University of Pittsburgh. Professional and
applied courses do not count toward the academic
requirements for membership.

5. A Quality Point Average of from 4.00 to 3.50 in
courses taken at the University of Pittsburgh. The
exact requirement varies with the number of liberal
arts credits completed with a letter grade.

6. Ordinarily, the distribution of credit requirements
must be satisfied and the QPA criterion met by the
end of the term preceding the term of graduation.

Election to membership in Phi Beta Kappa is
wholly within the discretion of the members of the
University of Pittsburgh chapter. No right to

election shall adhere to any student solely by reason T

of fulfillment of the minimum quality point average.
Good character shall be required in all cases.

Students who entered the College of Arts and
Sciences prior to the Fall Term of 1994-95 and other
students who may have a question concerning
eligibility requirements are invited to communicate
with Professor Herbert Chesler of the Economics
Department, who is chairman of the local chapter's
eligibility committee. He may be reached at 648-
1706. His office is in room 4A2O Forbes
Quadrangle. I

Dorsett

°From page C-2
the NCAA rushing record of

‘ 6,526 yards, won the Heisman

Trophy and led Pitt to the 1976
national championship. Hewas
also the only four—time All-
American in Pitt history.

On that morning in Canton,
he said that one man, Johnny
Majors, believed he wasn’t too
small to be a major college
running back. .

“I still use today the advice

Coach Majors used to give us,”
Dorsett said. “Coach Majors
used to always say the little
things you do make the big
things happen.”

“There’s never been a greater
football player in the game of
football,” Majors said.
“Nobody could run the football
like he could run it.”

Another Pitt coach, Jackie
Sherrill, who now coaches at
Mississippi State, recruited

Dorsett and was in attendance
for the induction.

“I was extremely proud of a
young man who had a dream
and a vision and then to watch
that dream come true — I’m
proud to be a part of it,”
Sherrill said.

When Dorsett became the
Dallas Cowboys first-round
draft pick in 1977, he said
many people, again, thought he
would be too small to last in

the pros. He played 12 years.

Former Dallas coach Tom
Landry presented Dorsett for
induction into the Hall of
Fame. Dorsett said Landry lis-
tened to what he, as a player,
had to say.

“I told him, ’Coach I can’t
run the ball strictly as the play
is designed,"’ Dorsett said. “I
run to daylight.”

Landry let TD run and he
rushed for 12,739 yards in his

career, second on the all-time
list when he retired.

Dorsett now runs the Dallas
Cowboys Sports Cafe —— a
restaurant in Dallas, Texas —
and Anthony Jr. said his dad
still does personal appearances
as well.

Dorsett, still looking as
though he could play, stood at
the steps in Canton on his
greatest day and summed up
both his speech and his life.

“I’ve traveled all around the
world and I know I’ve come a
long way to get back here, an
hour’s drive from my begin-
nings,” Dorsett said. “And
there’s one thing I’ve learned
 if we always run to daylight.
we can even find our way back
home.”

Dorsett overcame another
challenge that day. He never
shed a tear.

Martin

0 From page C-4
Beach, Calif.

“I am real tight with them."
Martin, whose cousin Sam
Sneed does their music, said.
“A couple of my cousins from
Pittsburgh and I went down
there for Christmas break and
chilled with Snoop and Dre.

“They call sometimes and I
call them sometimes. They
might say, ‘Curt, we want to
come down and chill.’ We are
all chill like that.”

Since the three have formed
a lasting relationship, Dre and
Snoop have visited Martin
numerous times. They even
plan to drop in to see a couple
of Pitt games.

If Snoop or Dre time their
visit right, they can see Martin,

barring injury. become the
school’s second all~time lead-
ing rusher.

Martin, who is presently fifth
on the Panthers all—time rush-
ing list, is speculated to surpass
Elliott Walker, Craig Heyward
and Richards, all present or
former NFL running backs.

Like Snoop and Dre’s high
profile. Martin‘s numbers are
making him a marked man in
the Big East.

But according to Martin, this
year is not going to be a one-
man show.

“With the attitude and the
shape that everyone is in, it is
much better than the previous
years I have been here.” he
said. “So I am expecting us to
be an improved football team.”

“It's not going to affect us at
all." Thornton said of
Lucanie’s departure. “We have
loads of talent on this team.
We’ll do really well."

Even if the Panthers can
compensate for the loss of
Lucanie’s talent. there might
be a huge void in leadership.
There is not that one player
who the team can rely on in
crunch time. That one player
who can lift the team when
they get into a funk.

But Alvear is not worried.
She believes the leadership
responsibility might be a col-
lective effort. g

“You look to the seniors for
leadership, but we have some
injuries there,” Alvear said.

“Right now I really couldn’t
say. Like I said. overall. every-
one is stepping up their effort,
but as far as one person,
specifically Sarah Mikla.
She’s one of our most consis-
tent athletes, academically and
physically. I think she’s going
to be a leader.”

Mikla. a 6-foot junior, was a
major cog last year as an out-
side and middle hitter.

Also, Alvear said Jenny
Driscoll, a 5-foot—ll—inch
sophomore, “is a very intense
competitor” and expects some
of the leadership duties to fall
on her shoulders.

Although injured, Thornton
would be the easiest choice
because of her experience.

“I would be happy to be

a leader on this team."
Thornton said. “If they want to
give it me. I’ll be proud to
take it.”

With all the "ifs” on the the
team, one thing is for certain
— the Panthers are the reign-
ing champions in the Big East
and everyone will be gunning
to stop their monopoly of win-
ning.

The toughest competition
looks to come from Seton
Hall, who took Pitt to five
games last year in the Big East
Championships.

Winning seven in a row of
anything is difficult, but
Thornton doesn’t think so.

“Definitely,” Thornton said
of seven-peat, “no doubt about
it.”

Iron City Punk

‘Various Artists

Ripe Records

In the aftermath of Woodstock ‘94, it’s encour-
aging to know that the credo, “Sex, Drugs and
Rock ‘n’ Roll,” still means something. If you’re
looking for a true alternative to corporate pansy
rock, smash your head on the Iron City Punk.

Old punks never die they just move to Pittsburgh

 blah, blah, blah. The bottom line is there is a
scene that caters to those seeking adrenalin-

-soaked, barre chord-heavy mayhem right in

Pittsburgh. You can see a three-band show for
$2 or $3 and buy a few 7” singles for less than
the cost of a movie. The quintessential
Pittsburgh punk experience has been captured
on a compilation CD on the homegrown Ripe
Records label. Iron City Punk showcases 13
bands and 28 songs all under three minutes and
25 seconds.

One of the many highlighted on the disk is
Anti-Flag. They don’t call them the fast-kid
punks for nothing. The three songs showcase
intense drumming and crafty basslines. Of
course, there is more snotty guitar buzz and
vocal rants than Johnny Thunders could shake a
stick at. This band is young and pissed off. “Red
Neck,” ‘‘I’m Feeling Slightly Violent” and “A Song

For Jesus Christ” exemplify their aggressive atti-
tude and are favorites of their live shows. This is
the most intense punk band in Pittsburgh.

Wormhole also has three songs featured on
the disk. Women are often overlooked in the
testosterone-filled world of punk. How many X-
Ray Specs songs can you name? Bands like L7
and 7 Year Bitch are now getting recognition for
their talent; Wormhole can’t be too far behind.
Mixing dynamic rhythm changes and heavy,
commanding vocals from Ms. Catanzaro, the
band shows that having a female fronting the
band is an asset. “Backburn,” “On Your Mind”
and “Prize Patrol” are strong offerings.

What happens when a philosophy major
speaks his mind? Bad Genes is an essential
part of the scene. Swanky crooning, a solid
rhythm section and a variety of guitar rhythms
make for two enjoyable songs, “Affirmation” and
“lndifference.” Much. more intelligent than the

 

AUGUST 29 1994

Ramones, but with all the ‘50s-style, makes the
group very desired. Currently, their show is on
the road in Europe.

Aus-Rotten is as raunchy as you could hope
for and as drunk as you’d expect. They are a
Pittsburgh institution, always stirring things up.
They seem to have a lot of fun playing live and
put on good shows. “Final Decry” and “Have
Another” have everything you want in a punk
song: politics, muscle and beer. They churn out
rowdy sing-alongs for the aloof.

Another band that has achieved notoriety for
live shows is Submachine. They look like they
wandered out of London in the late ‘70s. Can
you say mohawk? Along with an old school aes-
thetic, the band has an old school sound. Pure
punk, plain and simple. “Suicide Drive,” “Denial”
and “lnnocence” anchor the CD in the roots of
the music.

Also featured on the compilation are The
Addicts and Cavemen From Oklahoma. Both
bands are legendary and have speakable cult
followings. lnebriates, Ton of Bricks, Liverball,
Hard On Gang and Discord also appear on the
recording. Great packaging, complete with band
addresses and good music make this disk a
must buy. Plus, it’s cheap!

“As the corporate ogre expands its

Underground Compilation, K

'':-‘‘-:u'‘'

“|t’s the music, stupid.” — quote on
a pamphlet available at the CMJ
Music Marathon, 1993

The quotes above present two
divergent, yet equally valid perspec-
tives on the state of independent
and major label music. K Records is
a small label based in Olympia,
Wash. which has presented indie
music for a little more than a
decade. The folks at the label, like
many others which have creeped
up since K’s inception, pride them-
selves on the fact that they’ve main-
tained their grassroots level, pre-
senting original music on their

. . . 0
terms without compromising or

doing anything in the name of the
almighty dollar.

You have to admire them for that.

They've stuck to their guns and
managed to thrive.
' But on the other hand, indie rock
has given birth to an indie elitism,
which says everything associated
with a major label is bad. Even if
the band we’re discussing started
out on an indie label.

Now a lot of the music being
dished out by the big labels — hell,
most of it —— doesn’t come within‘
shouting distance of the power of a
lot of indie rock. But that doesn’t
mean that all of it should be tossed
out the window on principle. Many
bands that sign to a major pay the
price by compromising their sound.
But not everyone.

Which brings me to the second
quote. You listen to a record for
music, not to develop an agenda.
And if you do, grow up. High school
is over. Just because your favorite
band signed to DGC, don’t give up
on them. (Be skeptical, maybe.)
And besides, if I gave you a blind-
fold test and made you guess an
indie from a major, I have a feeling I
could stump you.

The debate can go back and
forth. Independent labels by and
large feature some of the most
exciting and unique music coming
out today. But the majors have
some goodies too, as evidenced by

......_...-- . ......._-.. .-. 4 . . 4‘

 

   

.~ -2. :=.~c«.-5:2,. . , .:.>n;=,.%‘.-=-.
recent releases by Gumball
Hole. On the other hand, some
indies are responsible for some
masturbatory releases which exude
the “it’s—good-because-it-sounds-
like-shit” credo.

Yet in the final analysis, what
makes independent labels more
exciting and meaningful is the fact
they’re fueled by basic inspiration.
And that comes from hearing music
that really moves you and makes
you want to create your own.

People who run indie labels are
usually just like people who buy
their records —— average folks who
like hearing good music. They’re on
the same level as you and I and

make your own.
Radio Stations

While the following stations don’t
all adhere to the indie rock credo,
each one provides you with an
alternative to slick commercial
radio, hate mongering disc jockeys
and programming that relies heavily
on music recorded at least 10 years
ago.

WPTS-FM, 92.1. Pitt’s own college
station, which recently moved down
the dial from 98.5 to its new home
outside of the commercial band.
Approaching its 10th anniversary,
‘PTS features a musical rotation

they approach music virtually the
same way as we do. Major label
folks look at it more as a business,
whereas indies see it more as a
labor of love where recognition out-
weighs the significance of profits,
which are scant anyway.

And if you think something is
missing in the music scene, it’s

easy to start your own do—it-your-,

self. You can virtually‘ run a record
label from your bedroom if you want

to try.

Ever since the birth of punk rock
in the late ‘70s, Pittsburgh has seen
a lot of significant bands, radio sta-
tions, record stores and self-made
magazines come and go. The fol-
lowing presents a current guide of
all of them. And remember, if you
aren’t satisfied with what you see,

 srstars, the Karl Hendrick rio under thelighs erfringo-tech love gs.

that allows you to hear an obscure

single from a small-time band side- ’

by-side with a rap groove and one
of your favorite bands. The station
features many specialty shows
including jazz, reggae, rap and
other genres. A regular program
guide is available by calling the sta-
tion at 648-7990 during regular
business hours or by writing to, or
visiting, the station at 411 William
Pitt Union, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260.
The request line is 648-7989.

WRCT-FM, 88.3. Carnegie Mellon
University’s free-form station.
Unlike WPTS, ‘RCT’s music varies
with the deejay’s tastes. Depending
on when you listen, you’ll hear rock,
blues, reggae, techno, metal, hard-
core and some of the best jazz pro-
gramming in the city, ranging from

  
 

 

bop to free jazz. The station’s pro-
gram guide can be obtained by call-
ing 621—WRCT or by writing to
Program Director, 5200 Forbes
Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213.‘

WYEP-FM, 91.3. While this com-
munity-run radio station might not
present as much outre music as the
aforementioned stations, it presents
a plethora of music you won’t hear
elsewhere. Alternative pop and folk
music can be heard throughout the
day. “Modern Times” presents more
cutting edge music in the late
evening. Saturday mornings at 10
a.m., tune in for “The Rhythm
Review,” a syndicated show that

 

presents an excellent batch of soul
and rhythm and blues that you’ll
never hear on other stations. A pro-
gram guide is available by writing to
Program Director, Box 66,
Pittsburgh, PA, 15232 or by calling
661-9100.

WDUQ-FM, 90.5. Based out of
Duquesne University, this station’s
"programming features programs
produced by National Public Radio.
But locally produced shows feature
mainstream and big band jazz.

hip hop scoop

Hey, what up yo! I’m back wit the the new
scoop. Check it, I'm sittin’ here with one of the
youngest in charge and the newest on the
scene. Her name, for those who don’t know is
Lori Scott (a.k.a. Buttamilk) and she can be
heard every week on 92.1 WPTS (she also
hooks me up with the phat shit). Now let’s get to
the story.

Lori is one of the youngest promoters in the
area at age 19 (that’s right 19). She is responsi-
ble for supplying all of Pittsburgh with the latest
and phattest in hip-hop music. She’s also
responsible for following up on the street buzz
and radio airplay, which is reported back to the
record labels via play lists and sales reports. Lori
also keeps in close contact with all of the dee-
jays and local radio stations she services, as
well as record store owners.

This young woman is working with Sean
“Puffy” Combs, who is formerly of Uptown
Entertainment and now resides as president and
CEO of Bad Boy Entertainment. She also works
with Parrish Smith, formerly of EPMD and now

   

the president and CEO of PMD Records. Ms.
Scott is an official promoter for major artists,
such as: Craig Mack, The Notorious B.l.G. a.k.a
Biggie Smalls, Top Quality and PMD. Bandoola
Records, a new independent label, also has Lori
representin’ Ground Floor and Organized
Konfusion in Pittsburgh.

Lori has migrated across the United States,
travelin’ from coast to coast, she calls New York
her home. Surrounded by New York's growing
hip-hop culture, her promotions career took off,
leading her to the Pittsburgh music scene. A
scene which has long been overlooked now has
something to offer the music industry. The new
flava of local talent is not overlooked in Lori’s
busy schedule, she is open to hear demos and
critique new material.

The future is bright for Lori Scott, oh my fault
Buttamilk! She is now working on establishing a
production company solely based in the
Pittsburgh area. With a little luck and her already
great work ethic, local talent won’t have to go far
to be picked up by a phat record company. Lori

AUGUST 29 1994 7

Scott, New York is in her heart, but she repre-
sentin’ in Pittsburgh.

Now ya know who Lori is, oops, sorry  who
Buttamilk (l did it again) is, she wants to send
some parting shout outs to Deanna for putting
up with her. Next shouts go to the crew at
WPTS (J.D., Blakk Steel and the 10th Brotha),
the Bad Boy Entertainment family (Puffy, Harv,
Kelly and Don C.), Craig Mack and the 9B
Brentwood Crew, B.l.G. and the Junior Mafia,
Bandoola Records and Ground Floor (The video
is phat ya’ll), Big Wayne at Uptown
Entertainment (thanks for the love), Hobo and
the Back Alley Promotions Crew, June chillin’ in
Atlanta and last but not least, my man on the
one and two D.J. Chip, a.k.a. Supa Cee. Oh,
one more to the boy who can graf his a** off lan.

Aiight Pittsburgh know you know, so be on the
look out for Lori Scott, a.k.a. Buttamilk with the
phattest new sh*t hitting Pittsburgh. This is JD
and I'm out, one love. Oh for you non—be|ievers,
what you know about that Booy?

just kidding! What’s up everybody? Blakk Steel

lam the terror that flaps in the night! Naw, l’m
is back in effect, bringing’y_ou some of the hap-

penings*and r_nu_sic.reviews in the world ofAHip ,, ‘

Hop. For those'of you who know me, one love
and welcome back. I hope you made enough
paper over the summer because you’re definitely
gonna need it! For those of you who don’t know
who I am, let me introduce myself.

I am Blakk Steel, rap music director of your
campus radio station, WPTS 92.1 FM, writer of
this weekly column and one of the many hosts
on the world’s first R-rated video show called
“Underground Hip Hop Video Magazine.” The
video show can be seen on TCI cable channel
21 (or, if you have cable—ready TVs, it's channel
7 on the B-side) at 11 p.m. on Monday nights.
Videos, when available, are uncensored. An
example of this would be the uncensored ver-
sion of Sir Mix—A—Lot’s “Put ‘em on The Glass.”
To the brothers, words can’t describe this video
well enough.

On the radio end, you can catch my radio
show Friday nights at 9 p.m. I try to bring you
the newest and phattest that rap has to offer.
Sometimes, l’ll even take you on a few trips
down memory lane with some of the older clas-
sics. It’s all good! My ace, The Tenth Brotha,
cleans up the funk at 11 p.m. with more rap on

the less popular side; he calls it “The B-side.”

For your dose of rap during the week, The 40
D’s hit you on!Tuesdays at 11 p.m. with the
funk, as well as phat interviews, and sometimes,
unreleased material!

Be on the lookout, because we are looking to
expand in the areas of R&B and Reggae (once

again). If you’re interested in any of these two
areas, contact me @ 648-7990. From there, l’ll
hit you with the details.

On the writing end, I handle the rap music
news and reviews for The Pitt News, with other
prospects in the wings. I base my judgments on
unbiased opinions; in plain English, even if I,
personally, don’t like an artist, I give credit where
credit is due. I keep my flavor fresh, but I also
keep it real. It’s all good! With very little restric-
tions on my writing, it allows me to write in terms
that you understand (I can use slang, but I can’t
really cuss!) I keep a very close base with my
audience, because I'm not better than anyone
else. Occasionally, I send shouts, but I have to
cut back because Bill said so! (Ha!)

One other note, I usually deejay the frat and
sorority parties in the Union. In fact, I'll be spin-
ning at the Indaba. Since it's free, if you attend

Celebra e the New Dark
Age
Polvo
Merge

Forget the neo—1970s
nostalgia barrage — oops,
garbage. Don’t believe that
raves are somehow spiritu-
al, mind-altering phenome-
non. No amount of bad acid
can rival the psychedelic
experience that is Polvo.

Strawberry Alarm Clock, it
is not. Creative and exciting
with no apparent ounce of
kitsch, it is. What’s most
striking about the band is its

 

genuine approach to music
that sounds far from typical.

to the sounds of a whammy
bar assault, tortured slurring

Polvo offers its own tvi/'lsted.\guit_ar riffs creating a sound-

perspective on rock ‘n’ roll,
ignoring or disregarding
conventional approaches.
This is what indie rock is
supposed to be about.
Many bands just substitute
noise for cliche, but Polvo
transcends with its own
ideas of songwriting without
sounding like elitist snobs.
This isn’t art rock; there’s no
concept to understand. The
song structures may be
atypical, but the music
speaks for itself. Celebrate
the New Dark Age is
Polvo’s best recording to
date, and it is a highlight of
the impressive Merge
Records catalog which fea-
tures Polvo’s two albums
and singles. Viva North
Carolina! Viva Chapel Hill!
“Fractured (Like
Chandeliers)” is the quintes-
sential Polvo song. It starts

st§:t‘pe‘for the rhythm to
thrive on. ‘‘I guess I slept all
day so I could be awake
right now  sums up the
overall attitude of the song.
lt’s an interrupted dream
that is recounted between

nodding in and out of sleep. '

Call it a generation’s theme
and Polvo’s second guitar
player will laugh at you.
“City Spirit” is so beautiful
it‘s eerie. The main theme is
played by a lone guitar and
evokes the spirit of Jimi
Hendrix. lt’s a slow, slippery
melody that flutters all over
the fretboard, eventually
assimilated into the chordal
texture of the song. The
vocals are crooned, not just
sung. This kind of delicate
and powerful approach can
be rivaled by no other indie
artist except Robert Pollard
of Guided By Voices.

There’s no tough gnarl on
this gem. The whole song
vibrates with that vintage’
Fender tremolo. it gives the
song at seductive, water-
logged flavor.

As gorgeous as “City
Spirit” is, “Tragic Carpet
Ride” is menacing. “Tell me
about everywhere you’ve
been so I can hold it over
your head!” baits, then
switches the listener, literal-
ly (and then some). If only
Toad the Wet Sprocket
could put out contagious
music with half the bite of
this song. lt’ll never happen,
but do you want it to? This
tune is the rocker of the
album and is powered by a
reckless call for danger, ‘‘I
won’t get out  l’d rather
burn!”

As the name could imply,
“Solitary Set” is sort of a
nod to Eastern music. lt’s a
poppy, sitar—like melody
played on the electric slide

guitar; imagine what pop
music might sound like in

"India. Quick, intertwined

slidemelodies float along
the driving bass line. The
song is removed from the
1960s transcendental medi-
tation phenomenon, thank-
fully.

“Every Holy Shroud” is an
exaggerated, tongue in
cheek look at Polvo and
stardom, among other
things. The first theme
showcases a brittleand
choppy song structure in
which lyrics like, “We would
like to know where you fit in,
what are you trying to prove
with that formulated grin?”
perversely comment on the
whole indie scene. The sec-
ond theme is all rock ‘n’ roll.
‘‘I know who we sound like, I
hope they care  and we
just bought a sitar, so be
prepared!” This is Polvo’s

ere’-s the local and

not-so-improbable
scenario: you’re a
disc jockey at an urban col-
lege radio station, WPTS-
FM. The station is under
both Federal
Communications
Commission and university
supervision, and both
watchdogs prohibit obscene
material from being broad-
cast and both have the
authority to take the mike
away from your mouth.
Your problem lies in the

'FCC’s non—definition of

 

ﬂAv$4A‘AA

which coyly
states, as part of its three-
prong obscenity test, “An
average person, applying
contemporary community
standards, must find that
the material, as a whole,
appeals to the purient inter-
est [in order to be broad-
cast.]” ‘

What???!

Since any notions of aver-
age people recall an
Onrvellian fascism and defi-
nitions of community stan-
dards are non-existent, how
useful or democratic is the

FCC’s obscenity test?

“When you get right down
to it,” said WPTS station
manager Rich Puerzer, “the
FCC rules are pretty
vague?

Check that, vague is a
compliment for these juve-
nile restrictions. Here at
Pitt, in theory at least, those
murky FCC regulations will
have a bearing on WPTS’
music selection. Using the
FCC’s three-fold obscenity
test as guidelines, Puerzer
and other deejays will begin
forming a committee to

 

determine obscenity, inde-
cenc _and the on—air limits

-of“l"ree speech for Pitt. What

policies the committee will
come up with are unknown,
but it seems highly unlikely
WPTS would change its rel-
atively loose format to con-
form to some bureaucratic
doublespeak — “protect the
children from vulgarity”
hype.

Currently, WPTS deejays
have a lot of freedom over
the material they air: Deejay
Booke Shulak illustrated this
by airing an Angry Samoans
song which he said “is prob-
ably one of the worst [most
vulgar] songs ever made.”

At 10 watts, WPTS has an
extremely limited frequency,
and with the limitation of
power, fewer people are
exposed to the station’s
music. ‘‘I bet you about
three people are listening
right now, at most,” Shulak
said as the Angry Samoans

played.

So why should deejays
fear FCC restrict_ions? Who
knows? ” ’

According to WPTS
Advisor Ron Asbury, no
deejay will be required to
sign the station’s policy, but
he said every deejay will be
made aware of the station’s
obscenity definitions —
which seems to be a tri-
umph for the indie minority.

If the first part of the
FCC’s obscenity test piqued
your ire, then stop reading
because the next qualifica-
tion just rolled in on 12
pathetic hops from left field
—— “the material, taken as a
whole, must lack serious lit-
erary, artistic, potitical or
scientific value.” The rule is
a clever, and dangerously
elite, clause running
counter to American princi-
ples of egalitarianism and
democracy. Who’s going to

determine those cultural '

values —— the FCC autocra-
cy or Pitt students? Shulak
hit upon the essence of the
polemic: “The worst thing is
other people making deci-
sions for you, and college
radio is supposed to be
away from that.”

A typical FCC argument
supporting the three-prong
test would note that
obscenity definitions are
purposely elastic sothat
every populace and genera-
tion may set its own limits.
Asbury said he could not
define what the limits to
broadcasting freedom
should be, “because the
FCC can’t even answer
that.” ‘ '

However, the FCC is an
unelected body owning
every single radio station
license in America and, as
previously stated, the
agency has the power to
revoke every license with-
out due process. So, with
its dictatorial power and
intentionally ambiguous
test, the FCC has already
madethe determination that
obscenity is what it deems
obscene, and if deejays
don’t like it — well, see ya!

Currently, (of course) the
FCC prohibits obscene lan-
guage on the airwaves.
However, it does allow inde-
cent language to be broad-
cast during a safe harbor
period between 8 p.m. and
6 a.m. (WPTS’ safe harbor
period runs from midnight
until 5 a.m.) and WPTS
directors review all material
for indecent and obscene
content before it is broad-
cast. Puerzer said if a song
is flagged indecent, WPTS
will either edit out the inde-
cent portions or air it during
the safe harbor period. _

icture this, some

exec’s office at Tri-

Star studio where
your standard film company
weasel is pitching 

‘‘It’s like a ‘Jurassic Park’
crossed with ‘Aliens,’ and
the cult appeal of an
‘Addams Family,”’ says the
weasel, while the
Hollywood exec’s cranium
spins out the motto.

“Remake, remake safe,
remakes good.”

Yes, trailing the success
of remakes like “The
F|intsones,” (not necessarily
a shoo-in for largest waste
of $6.50 this year until Jean
Claude Van Damme in
“Time Cop” comes out) and
exploiting America’s love of

 .-"-":5-3:3’

 

any movie that spends
more money on special
effects than the gross
national product of three or
four Central African coun-
tries combined, Tri-Star has
bought the rights to the
classic Japanese-guy-in-a-
rubber-suit movie,
“Godzilla.” lt’s been given’ a
budget of $40 million and is
slated for a midsummer
release in 1995. lt’s going to
be the year of the Godzilla
Happy Meal.

My question is, does any-
body want another remake?
lt’s no longer good enough
for them to remake the
same movie like “Lethal
Weapon” and just change
numbers with the same

plot, same characters and
the same lines. Now they
have to remake TV shows
and rip off foreign films, like
turning “La Femme Nikita”
into “The Point of No
Return;” to be original in
Hollywood is apparently
about as smart an idea as
pissing on an electric fence.
The success of digital imag-
ing is why they decided to
pick on Godzilla. Big deal, I
still get a kick from every
string that lifted his tail, the
bulge in Godzilla’s neck
where the guy’s head is and
Tonka written on the side of
the Army trucks. It was
good enough for me at age
9 at the drive-in, why mess
with it. Toho studio in Japan

managed to create the last
20 movies so why not let
them make the next 20,
including a 1994 remake of
“Godzilla vs.
MechaGodzi|la.”

Even though the newer
ones are pretty hard to rent,
the older ones are still out
there. The late Toshiro
Honda, who directed the
majority of the Godzilla
movies, made some pretty
great chilling moments in
the original ‘54/’56
“Godzilla” and managing to
create one of the first anti-
nuclear/science-gone-terri-
bly-wrong movie.

“Them,” the great American
antinuclear B—film, came out
in the same year. The fol-

 

lowing Godzilla movies of
the ‘60s and ‘70s might
never have been as scary
but were entertaining in
other ways. OK, so we're all
spoiled by “Terminator 2”
and “Aliens.” Once upon a
time the sight of two giant
monsters destroying Japan
while karate-chopping each
other into submission was
enough to send a post-
orgasmic shiver down my
preteen spine. Nowadays
we see the guy in a rubber
suit fight a giant "puppet
while stepping on model
train accessories. In the
‘60s when we were kids,

’s Frid y night, '

in the Green Room, just
outside the Studio Theater
reading the dark graffiti
scrawled across the omi-
nous cinderblock walls,
when the Fabulous
Foursome — Tracey
Emberg, Michael Hartnett,
Louis Stein and Chick
Leiby, the third generation
of lmprov leaders —— strolls
in and surrounds me.

lmprovs, which began in
the fall of ‘89 for actor-train-
ing purposes, is entering its
sixth and strongest season.
Usually taking place every
night at 11 p.m. inside the
Studio Theater, it is a series
of theater games (“No set
guidelines, no format, no
script,” describes Hartnett.)

Q

the lmprov host. Leiby, the
junior sitting on the table I’m
trying to write on, will be
inheriting this much-coveted
position.

“A lot of my excitement is
just that, well  l’m god
here,” Leiby says of his
appointment with the room
exploding into laughter.
Chris Potocki, his predeces-
sor, explained to me the
fact that Leiby is “the only
person I could trust with this
crowd.” Interested in keep-
ing lmprovs inside the uni-
versity, he recommended
Leiby to succeed him.
“Chick is the Chosen One,”
Potocki continues solemnly.
“Remember the King Arthur
[legend?] There's no sword

 

fork in a Boston Chicken
Rotisserie.”

“There were a lot of things
that we wanted to do this
past year that never got
carried through,” Leiby
says, pulling himself togeth-
er. “The big goals right now,
that Tracey and l are work-
ing on, are: new games,
lmprov-sponsored produc-
tions (plays that are severe-
ly audience participatory)
and audience suggestion

V plays —-— a bizarre thing that

might be done.”

I ask them why they start-
ed coming to lmprovs, and
the common denominator
among them was to prac-
tice their craft, and at the
same time (like most other

lmprov regulars) to meet
new people.

Unlike The Attic on a
Friday, they never card. The
ages range on the average
from 17 to 47 bringing an
enlightening melding of
comedy-crossing genera-
tional lines.

“There is a real moment
of brilliance when you see
someone, who is probably
very nervous, getting up
there and just doing things
that they would naturally
do,” says Hartnett.

“That happens just about
every night. And it’s not the
people you would expect to
be funny  [you might see]

the kid from the back of

your Algebra class. To add

to the games, we want to
create an atmosphere

where you never know what

is oing to happen.”

sented with a crown, shawl,
gerbil food and was literally
worshipped for a night. I

I decide to stay for
tonight’s production. I join
in with the never—ending
stream of latecomers.
lmprovs average a crowd of
100 to 250 people every
week, and as I find a seat
on a table in the corner,
Leiby’s trying his best to
divulge the barely there
rules:

*Casper Rule — no boo-
ing allowed.

*Failure is OK.

*The host is the law.

*Everyone on stage
exists. Act as if they are.

*Use the situation you are

* Easy on the stereo-

games to begin in this void
space, deals with situations
and relationships — the

formers were male) den I

five people are dared to
represent the “color” plaid,
soon follow. It gave a new,

I dysfunctional twist to the

game of Twister.

music] would be your 2 Live
Crew stuff,’ he said. “The
independent college music
that is our bread—and—butter
doesn’t have a lot of that.”

But a lot of small label
musicians — whose only
broadcasting outlet is col-
lege radio —— aren’t so much
concerned with average
people or transient commu-
nity standards as making
music, and such music may
just contain obscene lan-
guage.

Utilizing language that
sometimes lurks far below
community standards, musi-
cians may force people to
take notice of points of view
they previously wou|dn’t
damn about.
Resurrecting the “Cop
Killer” debate, lce—T may
not have changed anyone’s
opinion of the police one
way or another, but at least
when the song was
released it offered an unmit-
igated voice denouncing the
perennial abuses of political
authority — kicking off con-
structive debates on the
subject.

,.
.- «*<%§~.a'-: ..

 
 

      

I don’t care wh t’s inde-
cent or decent. [WPTS] is
not mainstream radio, so
[the music] is not stuff
you're going to hear on pub-
lic radio and if it was, |’d lis-
ten to public radio,” said Pitt
student and WPTS listener
Yarone Zober.

However, Asbury said, it
is not just college students
who listen to WPTS. The
station has recently
changed frequencies from
98.5 to 92.1 FM. With the
move down the dial the sta-
tion could attract more
minors.

A genuine concern, grant-
ed, but Zober succinctly
noted, “the high school kids
know the language already.”

Even if every single Pitt
student had an opportunity
to vote on the obscenity
issue, implementing “com—
munity standards” into
WPTS policy would raise
the greater danger that is
always associated with First
Amendment issues: What
happens when the majority
of people dictate the actions
and speech of others? The

     

 

 

independent minority, of
course, is crushed — leav-
ing WPTS swimming in the
dark waters John Stuart Mill
once marked: “The tyranny
of the majority.”

If the Feds want to play
the big brother game with
commercial-free radio, let’s
extend these rules to televi-
sion-and ban Fox’s “Married
with Children.” With the
FCC’s “lacking serious artis-
tic value” clause, a felony
should be levied against the
show’s producers for ever
trying to pawn the show’s
culturally empty waste of
time off as entertainment.

But now the argument is
swimming in the toilet bowl,
right next to the stagnant
Feds — and the point is
what one person deems art,
another may find obscene.
Which is why applying FCC
rules to college radio seems
so ‘silly to WPTS metal
director Josh Mehl and
many others: Noise or rock
‘n’ roll, rap or crap, smut or
art, “as far as I’m concerned
if you don’t like what you

hear, turn it off,” he said.

really pushing the envelope
of film technology. Nobody
was doing what Toho was
doing and they did it
because of one man. Elji
Tsuburaya was the great
special effects man of the
‘60s. His use of front and
rear projection, miniaturiza-
tion and articulated pup-
petry was way ahead of
everybody else. He made it
possible for guys like
Spielberg and Lucas to do
what they did. “Star Wars,”
“Close Encounters” and
“Aliens” all owe it to this
guy. Or it could just be the
fact everybody had terrible
reception without cable in
the ‘70s that made "them
believable or that anything
looks good on a 50-foot
screen from the seat of your
car.

It doesn’t matter how
crappy the special effects
are though. To fans, what
really mattered is how weird
they were. They got pro-
gressively more weird.

so they decide to build a
really big MECHANICAL
lizard to fight it. Or later, the
same guys have a new
problem: Aliens have invad-
ed the earth dressed in
plastic suits and wearing
wraparound sunglasses. So
they get that really big lizard
to go step on the mountain
the aliens are living in with
the help of birdcalls.
Unfortunately, the aliens
have brought along their
own flying, three-headed
lizard but it turns out OK
because the guys’ lizard
kills the aliens’ lizard. Plus
bad dubbing gave us lines
like, “Hey, I got an idea let’s
get in that car, huh, and
drive away from Godzilla,
huh? Okay?” it’s just weird.
Whether I like it or not
“Godzilla” is coming to
America. What is the out-
look for the movie? Well,
first it’s going to be set in
America. So no bad

script is by the same team
who wrote Disney’s
“Aladdin.” That could be
weird and i mean really
weird, but don’t get excited
because I don’t think any-
one’s ready to produce
“Godzilla: The Musical!”

Third is that it’s Tri-Star
doing it, iffy territory. These
guys are responsible for “A
Nightmare Before
Christmas,” but also
“Angels in The Outfield.”
The clincher is the director,
but before I give that away,
let me tell you about the
runners-up.

One director considered
was the man who directed
“Home Alone” (a fortunate
mental block keeps me
from remembering his
name). I don’t know who
thought him up, but i sus-
pect somebody’s medica-
tion had to be changed after
they came up with the idea.
So thanks to smaller doses
of Prozac there will be no
Macaulay Culkin rolling a
bowling ball off the Empire
State Building onto
Godzilla’s head. ﬁm Burton

was also considered, a
good idea but no go. it
would have been interesting
to see what the grim one
was going to do. After all,
he’s the guy responsible for
“Beetlejuice” and the most
bizarre of mainstream film.
Another “Batman” alumni,
Sam Rami, who did one of
the rewrites, was consid-

ered. His “Army of
Darkness” was the best
movie in the

comedy/gore/horror/fanta-
sy/action/adventure catego-
ry for 1993, but i guess he's
tied up with the
“M.A.N.T.l.S.” series for Fox
he’s doing this season. The
winner is then, Alex Cox.

‘Who? Alex Cox — the
guy who directed both
“Repo Man” and “Sid and
Nancy.” This guy is to cult
movie fans what masturba-
tion is to cult movie fans, a
real pleasure. “Repo Man”
is required viewing for any-
one who thinks they’re a
smart-ass. I could tell you
that it was the expression of
pop culture angst for the
first generation of post-

punks for whom even the
idea of rebellion had lost its
meaning in commercialized
culture, featuring the music
of both the Butthole Surfers
and Black Flag. instead pic-
ture this: A glowing Chevy
Malibu flying across the Los
Angeles skyline; poetry
man. if you haven’t seen
“Sid and Nancy” yet, well
you haven’t seen “Sid and
Nancy” yet. Some consider
it to be the smartest film
about Punk’s stupidest cou-
ple, Sid Vicious and Nancy
whoever.

I’m pretty much against
this idea of a remake, but if
Cox can make a movie
even close to these two
then it could actually be
really good. Besides, can
you think of better sequel
possibilities than “Godzilla
and Nancy” —— the story of a
whiny, scrawny, female
junkie and her famous,
giant monster boyfriend.
The Army can kill.G by sup-
plying Nancy with a 25-foot

intense-nature of this town s
best lo-fi haunts we'll wait
until our next issue to
divulge an exhaustive list of
the finest spots to down live
music and liquids in the
same swallow.

Record Stores

In some cities, that title
might be a misnomer, but
Pittsburgh is still keeping
vinyl alive in many of its
excellent record stores.

Eide’s. A huge store that
stocks almost every kind of
independent music on vinyl
and CD. Lots of heavy
metal and comic books as
well. 1111 Penn Avenue,
Downtown, 261-3666.

Paul’s Compact Discs.
Once it was Jim's Records.
Now, it’s Paul’s CDs and its
owner carries on the tradi-
tion of carrying every new
blues, jazz and folk release
along with good selection of
indie releases. It has a
small but strong vinyl selec-
tion too. 4526 Liberty
Avenue, Bloomfield. 621-
3256.

Jerry’s Records. Like peo-
ple who start indie record
labels, Jerry Weber sells
records because he loves
them. You could get lost
among all the wax in his
store. And you owe it to
yourself to do that. The
store houses two floors of
used albums and compact

discs. 3710 Forbes Avenue,

Oakland. 687-1234.

Randy’s Alternative
Music. Until recently, a
quality record store has
been conspicuously absent
on the South Side. Randy’s
features a good selection of
major and -indie music.
While'most of the stock is
CDs — albums, singles and
cassettes are also available.
1318 East Carson, South
Side. 481-7445.

Pop Bus. Want to have
some fun? Go into the store

. on the second floor of 128

Oakland Avenue and ask if
it’s the Hemp Hour. (It isn't.
it’s the Greek Store; Hemp
Hour is upstairs.) Then walk
upstairs to Pop Bus and ask
Manny if he has any
Smashing Pumpkins CDs.
You see, Manny Theiner
prides himself on the fact
that he exclusively carries
independent (and often
obscure) releases. While
the store focuses on vinyl,
including a good selection
of 7” singles, some CDs are
available too. Oakland. No

Fanzines

In addition to the regular
daily and weekly papers,
you can also read about
local artists and musicians
in the following fanzines.

Discourse. Out of service
for nearly four years, this
music fanzine recently res-
urrected itself. Articles on

national and regional bands

as well as record reviews.
c/o lgor Records, P.O. Box
81517, Pittsburgh, PA,
15217.

Geek Girl. Photocopied (in
blue and white!) ‘zine that
features reviews of records
and other ‘zines. The col-
lage-type layout also
includes essays and goofy

letters. Simple but fun to we probably have the space and Wormhole.

young women putting out

to mention. But it’s worth a

‘zines. P.O.-- Box  1

Pittsburgh, PA,’ 15230.

Minus 7. Features articles
on local musicians and
artists. Unlike the other
‘zines mentioned here,
which are photocopied,
Minus 7‘ has a slick, printed
layout. 1723 Murray Avenue
#33, Pittsburgh, PA,15217.

Pawholes. While they
haven’t put out an issue
recently, previous issues of
this post-punk feminist pub-
lication are worth searching
out and there’s a brand

‘spankin’ new one on the

way. P.O. Box 81202,
Pittsburgh, PA, 15217.

Bands

And finally, this town is full
of a lot of bands. More than

Thefollowing groups have
released an album, CD,
and/or cassette. If you’re
interested in local bands,
check one of them out.
Anti—Flag, ATS, Aus
Rotten, Bad Genes, Barbed

The following is a partial
list of bands who don’t have
I releases yet. You
should go and support them
too, so that they’ll be able to
record and release some-
thing soon.

Addicts, Bitter Delores,
Blogurt, Drag, Esoteric
Edge, Final lris Company,
40 Stories, The World’s
Greatest Trio, iNdECiSioN,

Kelly Affair, Mommy,
Pucker, 7 Goats and
Smoking Pets.

If we’ve left anyone out,
our apologies.

Now that you’ve got the
information, it’s up to you to
use it to your own end.
There is a lot of artistic
activity going on in our fair
town. Don’t ignore it. And if
you’re not satisfied, go out
and do it yourself.

Bye, Bye Playhouse

On Aug. 31 the film repertory at t-he
Playhouse shuts down after 30 some years
of providing an eclectic mix of foreign,
inde endent, classic and second-run films.
(such as the still, right, from a recent
revival of Fellini's 8 1/2). _

The plug was ulled without warnin by
Point Park Co lege's Provost WII lam
Mclntosh. It all smells of more cor o-
ratism, onl this time from someone of er
than Pitt. I 'n you are as peeved as us at

et another move I: the suits in which we
lose a great cultura institution over what
amounts to a few piddling dollars

Mclntosh won't tell whether the Playhouse
. ost money or made it, according to the
Post-Gazette,) then feel free to wreak
havoc on the Point Park phone system I:
calling .391-4100 and giving Mr. Mclntos
‘a piece of your mind. i . A

In the mean time, he sure and support
your local independent film house or we

shot at critics “who
considered-them to be
Sonic Youth clones.
The song ends with a
bittersweet sentiment;
 an inspiration for
you  for you  f*ck
you.” This line is deliv-
ered in such a sincere
and subtle manner it
almost goes unno-
ticed.

“Old Lystra” is an
instrumental that
sounds similar to
“Solitary Set” but
turns into something
much different. Pop
hooks transform into a
spaghetti western/spy
movie soundtrack.
The main melody
played by one guitar
is answered by the
melodic and chordal
bursts; it’s a call and
response guitar dia-
log. -Instrumentals
often take heat for
being “dull,” but Polvo
gives skeptics a real
interesting alternative.

The last song,
“Virtual Cold” is a low-
keyed baHad.
Something like one,
anyway. it features
some pretty obvious
changes accompa-
nied by an obtuse
second guitar part
that pleasantly sur-
prises. The vocals are
reverb-drenched and
sustain forever. It is
the perfect release of
tension -— just a
relaxing sigh. The
song puts the listener
into dream mode right
where the first song
started.

Celebrate the New
Dark Age is a mature
effort from a band that
with each album:
pushes into new inter-
esting sonic territory.
Purchase it as a three
7-inch set or a CD ep
and look for a tour in
the fall.

to ward people off after
doing most of the writing
honors on that joint and
MC Breed’s phat single
“Gotta Get Mine.” And,
without a doubt, after doing
co-production on The
Chronic, Doggy Style,
“lndo Smoke” by Mista
Grimm, and the before-
mentioned MC Breed sin-
gle, Warren G was not a
name to be slept on to say

V the least.

Warren G showed some
skill rhyming on each of
these joints (except the
Breed joint,’ in which, he
didn’t rhyme). After having
problems with the puppet
master of Death Flow (l’m
not mentioning names), he
signed with “Baby” Chris

Lighty at Violator
Records. Then it was on.
When he dropped

“Regulate,” fans of Dre
went ballistic, but real
heads knew the time. The
album was not looked at on
the level of the previous
works he was involved in.
When the album dropped,
it was pretty unanimous,
but people had to spend
their money to find out
what I already knew. if you
listen to this album, there’s
one thing that you have to
keep in mind  he’s not his
brother. He can’t make
another Chronic.

Like The Chronic, this is
just a tool to get his pro-
duction out there on the
market. But, unlike
Chronic, there are no
rhymes to go with that pro-
duction. The only outstand-

ing joints on the album are
the current single, “This
D.J.,” which was my pick
off the album to be the next
release, and “Super Soul
Sis,” in which an unknown
female rapper rips mad
rhymes and, in the process,
disses Masta Ace by call-
ing him a “walking blood
bank that l’m gonna make a

‘ withdrawal with my shank.”

it’s her solo joint on the
album. If that song’s not
released as the next single,
the company is basically
putting the album to rest,
because the rest of the
album needs crutches
(because it’s lamel).
