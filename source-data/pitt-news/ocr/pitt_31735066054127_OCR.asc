Some profs
say Pitt's
faculty
buyout
won't work

Melissa Blackwood
Staff Writer

Pitt professor Marshall Singer hopes he's seen his last
Pittsburgh winter. ‘

"After the winter before last, I told myself I have to get
out of here," he said. "I just can't take it any more."

After 34 years of teach-
ing international affairs, he's
getting his wish. Singer plans to
retire next spring and move to
Washington, D.C.

He didn't necessarily
have to wait so long, though.

Singer could have
retired and moved to a warmer
climate more than two years
ago.

He said

But like many profes-
sors, he held off, hoping to cash
in on one of the lucrative retire-
ment incentive programs Pitt
has offered periodically since
1982.

A His wait paid off.

. . . . .  In October, the Board of
Trustees approved a plan to pay eligible professors a cash
bonus of up to $125,000 to retire by May, 1999.

According to University ﬁgures, Singer is one of 375
professors eligible for the buyout.

Administrators estimate 30 percent of them will sign
up for it and retire. .

If they do, Pitt says it will save $12.1 million dollars
in salary costs over the next seven years by replacing
retirees with lower-paid faculty members or leaving their
positions unﬁlled.

However, some professors don't think the incentive
plan will be too successful. .

One reason: the buyout passed by the trustees is less
generous than an earlier version endorsed by Faculty
Assembly.

That plan would have paid eligible professors up to
$250,000 to retire now.

Singer, for example, thinks he will be one of only a
few professors to take the buyout.

"It's not as much as I hoped for, but I just don't feel like

Imagine the convenience of
water dripping from a leaky ceiling
directly into the toilet below. A sim-

’ But the inconveniences are all
too obvious, especially for Pitt stu-
dent Marisa Murphy.

She says water dripped from a

It is the responsibility of the
landlord to ﬁx things that have been
damaged due to normal wear and
tear. Whether or not they do the
repairs is, another story.

"For two weeks, we had to pee

Pitt encourages late tuition payment
Tax breaks for eligible students make it a viable idea

Brett Taylor

News Assistant

Students who are normally
tardy with school payments take
note: Pitt wants you to pay this
year’s tuition late.

First- and second-year college
students who use cash or loans to
pay their tuition are eligible for a tax
credit of up to $1,500 a year, starting
in 1998.

To help students best capitalize
on the credit, Pitt sent letters to the

family of every student it believes is
eligible for the tax break

In the letter, Pitt informed the
students they could delay payment
of next semesters tuition until Jan.
12, 1998 in order to abide by the
rules of the bill.

The tax break is part of the
"Hope Scholarship,” a provision in
the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997
which was signed to law ust August
by President Bill Clinton.

Since the scholarship becomes
valid in 1998, students must pay

their tuition in 1998.

Any payment made before
January 1 will void the students’ eli-
gibility for the tax break, according
to Bob Lech, manager of Student
Accounts.

Lech said the "Hope
Scholarship" is not accurately
named. Students who reap its bene-
ﬁts will never actually receive any
money.

Instead, he said, they or
whomever pays their tuition can

The hawk feasts on a rabbit outside a classroom window at Thaw Hall.

Talons of death going wabbit
huntin’ near Thaw Hall

James Maude
Staff Writer

There's nothing like eating lunch a la
carte on a crisp fall afternoon. Just ask the
red-tailed hawk that frequents a window
ledge at Thaw Hall. Not too long ago, stu-
dents and faculty caught the hawk eating a
fresh serving of rabbit.

According to Jim Stango, a physics
demonstrator in Thaw Hall, the hawk was
snacking on a window ledge easily visible
from a stairway where students stream in
and out of class.

"Students were coming from all over
and looking at it. He was there for about a
half hour or so," Stango said.

Stango said janitors in Thaw Hall had
seen the hawk on numerous occasions
over the a three—week period, though this
is the first time it attracted major attention.
He said the bird may live on the Soldiers
& Sailors Memorial Hall, where a family
of hawks had lived for years. A family of
hawks also lived on the Syria Mosque
before it was demolished.

According to Robin Panza, the collec-
tions manager of the birds section at the
Carnegie Museum of Natural History, to a
hawk, a window ledge is like a cliff.

"It's an ideal place for the hawk to
eat," Panza said. "Down on the ground,
there's a lot of things to distract it and lots
of risks, as well as something which may
try to take its food."

Panza said that hawks often use the
same ledge. "They'll swoop down, take
their prey, and very often use a particular

area — a place which may have been use-

ful in the past."

Panza added that while she does not
know of any hawks living on the Soldiers
& Sailors Memorial Hall, it's not altogeth-
er impossible. She said the hawk is most
likely residing in Schenley Park. There
could be up to two pairs living there,
because hawks occupy quite large areas of
territory.

Stango said the administration should
commission the hawk, which he said is
approximately two feet tall, to carry stu-
dents between campus buildings.

RETIREMENT

waiting around any longer, " he said.

Singer also has another incentive to
retire that most other professors don’t
have — a job offer from American
University.

Another reason the
plan is not expected to
succeed is that many
professors are angry
about the way the plan
was put together.

Faculty Assembly
approved its version in
June and submitted it
to Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg for his
approval.

H 0 w e v e r ,
Nordenberg declined to
comment on the plan
until the new version was unveiled at the
board meeting in October.

Comments made by Nordenberg
and Board Chairman J. Wray Connolly
at the meeting indicated they had been

   

C Jaimesiiiollandi

FROM PAGE 1

negotiating the terms of a buyout the
whole time Nordenberg denied having
any knowledge about it.

"I think the administration's silence
and the long gaps in communication pro-
 duced mistrust on the
part of faculty mem-
bers," said professor
J arnes Holland, chair of
the task force that
endorsed the ﬁrst pro-
posal.

A third prob-
lem with the incentive
is that faculty members
keep ﬁnding objections
to the language in the
contract they must sign
to participate in the
plan.

For example, the buyout includes a
sentence which states the University has
the right to change health benefits of
retired professors.

New York roots band Blend will be the lead act in tonight's show at Grafli.

Concert to benefit scholarship
in deceased student's name

Brett Taylor
News Asslstant

Graffiti in Oakland will be jumping
tonight with smooth roots rock, peppy
ska and jangly altema—pop.

And it is all for the memory of
Ryan Steppacher. V

The show will feature the band
Blend, a rootsy acoustic-funk/rock out-
fit from New York. Blend will be play-
ing in the concert because a member of
the band is an extended family member
of Steppacher.

Blend's eclectic sound is reminis-
cent of local rock giants Rusted Root,
but their sound is a little more soulful
and displays more instrumental skill.

The jumpy Pittsburgh ska septet the
Simpletons will get the crowd dancing
with their poppy Jamaican rhythm and
fun—loving stage presence before Blend
takes the stage. In addition, they'll

cover the Cab Calloway song,” "Minnie
the Moocher," made famous in the
movie, The Blues Brothers.

Local altema—rockers Left On
Dorris will round out the musically
dynamic evening in North Oakland
with a healthy dose of REM—style pop-
rock.

Steppacher, a junior at Pitt, a rugby
player and a Phi Gamma Epsilon frater-
nity brother, was killed in an automo-
bile accident while returning from his
Luzeme County home on Oct. 26.

At the time of the death, Ryan
Murray, one of Steppacher's fraternity
brothers said, "Ryan was a great guy,
and he will be very missed."

Steppacher's life will be celebrated
tonight at the Graffiti.

The all-ages show kicks off at 8
p.m. Tickets are $6 and all of the pro-
ceeds go the the Ryan Steppacher
Memorial Fund.

CORRECTION: The library will be open from 9 am Saturday
morning until Wednesday night/Thursday morning at 2 am
during finals week, not 2 am Friday morning.

ty company, said that it was diﬁi—
cult to comment on that speciﬁc
case.

. "We try to address problems
as soon as possible. If they [ten-
ants] call us and request them [the
repairs], they get them," she said.

For Murphy, though, two
weeks was too long. ,

But senior Katie McNeil said
two weeks would have been a
more acceptable period of time to
repair her leaky ceiling.

She said she called her land-
lord the day she moved in to report
that her ceiling was leaking, but
ﬂtat it took almost a month for the

' landlord to repair it.

"They gave all these excuses
like, '\V1th all these people moving
in, we are two weeks behind.‘ If
they were two weeks behind, they
should have ﬁxed it two weeks
after I told them about it," said
McNeil.

She said the lag resulted in
unsightly, large water blisters and
yellow-brown stains on the walls
and ceiling of her dining room.

But a representative at Lobos
Management who wished to
remain anonymous said the prob-
lem probably wasn't that severe or
someone would have ﬁxed it right
away. He also said August is a
major move-in month for students

and that completing repairs during

longer.

"We do our best, but some-
times people expect second-day
service," he said.

But what if repairs are not
made? -

According to current
Pennsylvanialaw, the tenant can-
not automatically withhold rent.
Vvrthholding rent is paying into an
escrow account at a local bank in
order to force the landlord to
uphold his responsibility.

In order to do this legally,
though, the tenant must contact the
Allegheny County Health
Department and request an inspec-
tion of the apartment. The
University's Housing Resource
Center recommends having a list
of complaints ready for the inspec-
tor to ﬁle in his report.

If the tenant qualiﬁes, the
Health Department will send a cer-
tiﬁed letter stating that the dwelling
is unﬁt for human habitation and
that an escrow account may be

opened. The tenant must still pay .

rent, but the payments are directed
to the escrow account instead of
being sent to the landlord.

The inspector will retum to
the apartment periodically to
check the progress of repairs. If in
six months the repairs are still not
completed, the tenant is entitled to

a full refund of escrow payments.

It is important to remember
that since the tenant signed the
lease, he or she is bound to it, said
HRC Director Robert Hopkins.
However, there are other ways to
increase the pressure on a landlord
to get repairs done.

"You can get external pressure

‘from the Bureau of Building

Inspection by requesting an
inspection," said Hopkins. "They
will put additional pressure on
landlords to ﬁx the problems."
Jim King, senior building
inspector at the BBI, recommends
calling the Mayor Service Center
(255-2621) to ﬁle a complaint
about any problems in the apart-
ment that the landlord will not
address. The center is a place to

voice concerns about anything
from a lack of smoke detectors to
drafty windows.

. "When a complaint is taken,"
said King, "we have so many days
to follow up on it."

Perhaps Mike Ivan should
have tried outside pressure. He
complained that his former land-
lord was slow to make repairs.

Not wanting to rock the boat
after an alleged ﬁst ﬁght with his
landlord over his security deposit,
Ivan would not identify his land-
lord.

But he said, “It took three
months for him to tum up the
water pressure. Until then, every
time the lady downstairs ﬂushed
her toilet or ran water, our tap
would run dry. And it took six

weeks for us to get carpeting. We
couldn't even walk on the ﬂoor
barefoot because we would get
splinters."

Damien Scott didn't wait
around for his landlord to make
repairs. He just did them himself.

"There was poor upkeep.
Stuﬂ kept falling apart and break-
ing," said Scott. "We would just ﬁx
it or he would drop off materials
and we would have to ﬁx it."

Hopkins says that repairs on
the tenant's own initiative are an
option, and that there is even a pos-
sibility of deducting the costs from
the rent. However, the concept of
repair and deduct is not viewed
favorably by the courts, if the dis-
agreement should go that far.

Deductions ﬁom rent should
be made only if the landlord has
repeatedly promised to make
repairs but has failed to do so. The
tenant should keep all receipts and
mail copies to the landlord. This
way, the tenant is protected if the
landlord decides to sue. The tenant
must be able to prove the repairs
were made, they were necessary,
and the costs were reasonable.

Dave Zazac of the Allegheny
County Health Department rec-
ommends a civil do-it—yourself
approach and said, "The landlord
may say, Td really like to do it, but
I don't have time.‘ That's a good

time to ask, ‘Could I do it, or hire a contrac-
tor, and have it taken off my rent?"' said
Zazac.

Scott and his girlfriend A.J. Burke said
they were never compensated for their
efforts. They said they had to insulate their
kitchen and bathroom by themselves
because it was so cold in those rooms and
their landlord would not do it.

"There were no deductions for helping
his sony ass out," said Scott.

Vince Citriniti, Scott's landlord, was
reluctant to comment on any questions
posed to him and instead repeatedly insisted,
"There are lots of things done against land-
lords," and "most of the trouble is done by
the tenan ."

that notices were posted on the building door
monthly, infonning tenants that their land—
lord had not paid either the gas or water bills.

Then about a week before the bill was
due, they said Citriniti would pick up one of
the tenants up, give him the money for the
minimum payment, and drive him to the
utility company to pay the bill.

According to People's Gas, if a landlord
has not paid his gas bill, the tenants can pay
the minimum balance to retain services and
have the amount deducted from their rent. If
the landlord pays the bill himself, he is
forced to pay the entire balance. People's
Gas said they do this to protect the tenant.

who occasionally don't pay the utility bills
on time are reputedly a common problem in
this area.

But Scott and Burke think their situa-
tion may be a little more severe. They said

"Citriniti wouldn't do it "

Citriniti denies that the gas was ever
shutoff, and says notices from the gas and
water companies were posted periodically,
but "not every month."

 

The cracking paint and plaster i s s uncovered.

"Utility companies give [tenants] the
choice of deducting the payment from the
rent payment," said Citriniti. "Whatever they
bring, they bring it on themselves." '

Citriniti added that part of the problem

vice (resulting ﬁom service malfunction or
unpaid bills) are violations "which constitute
a serious health hazard"

Flintstones’ and Jetsons’ birthplace could become historic landmark

Across the Nation

LOS ANGELES — It’s the place where
the Flintstones and the Jetsons were cre-
ated — and now, it could be declared a
historic landmark.

The Los Angeles Culture Heritage
Commission toured the Harma—Barbera
studio on Wednesday.

The green and yellow buildings are
the focus "of a ﬁght because Time Warner
wants to sell the site to Universal Studios.

Universal says it will use the build-
ings for office space and not tear them
down, but some Harma—Barbera workers
aren’t so sure. They’re trying to get the

Bucks West High School.

Officials say three adults and six
juveniles were rounded up on
Wednesday. All but one are students at
CB West.

The other, according to authorities, is
a student at Delaware Valley College who
went to the high school and sold drugs to
an undercover drug agent who had been
in the school since the start of the school
year.
Ofﬁcials say the nine were involved
in sales of hashish and marijuana.

According to District Attorney Allen
Rubenstein, the $12,000 spent on the
investigation came from money conﬁs-
cated in other drug cases.

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. — A woman
who was left paralyzed and mute from a
savage beating has identiﬁed a man in a
North Carolina courtroom as her
assailant.

Jill Marker was in a wheelchair, and
her head moved spasmodically, as a pros-
ecutor in Winston—Salem asked her
whether defendant, Kevin Smith, beat her
two years ago.

She managed to write on a board the
words, “It was.”

Marker spent weeks in a coma after
the beating, and gave birth to her son
while in a vegetative state. She was preg-
nant when she was attacked during a
$295 robbery.

At another point in yesterday’s pro-
ceedings, Marker nodded her head affir-
matively when asked whether she was
sure Smith was the man who hurt her.

All the while, Smith shook his head
“no” at the defense table.

Smith is on trial for armed robbery
and assault with intent to kill.

Around the World

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -
Darnaging testimony was made against
Winnie Mandela from her former chief
bodyguard.

Jerry Richardson says Mandela
ordered the killings of suspected police
informers in the late 1980s.

Richardson told South Africa’s Truth
and Reconciliation Commission that his
hands were ‘‘full of blood” from carrying
out orders from President Nelson
Mandela’s ex—wife.

Richardson says he carried out two
murders ——— those of a 14-year-old boy
and a woman. Richardson is serving a life
sentence for the boy’s murder.

The bodyguard said Mandela never
killed anyone but used other people to kill
for her.

Mandela was supposed to testify
Wednesday, but her appearance was
pushed back until tomorrow because
Richardson spent so much time on the
stand.

receive credit toward their federal income
tax for that year.

Students have to look at how much they
are paying with either cash or loans and how
much federal income tax they owe to get the
correct amount of the credit.

Grant or scholarship money used to pay
tuition is not applicable to receive the tax
credit.

When the students or their parents ﬁle
income tax returns at the end of the year they
have the responsibility to ﬁgure out how
much credit they are eligible for, Lech said.

At the end of the year, Pitt will send the
enrollment and ﬁnancial information about
each student to the Treasury Department and
the IRS.

The IRS will then have the information
about every student so it can check the
amount to be sure the students credits them-
selves for that year, according to Lech.

"If they [the students] ﬁle the wrong
amount, I suspect the IRS is going to get
them for it," Lech said.

Lech emphasized that students planning
to employ the beneﬁts of the "Hope
Scholarship" tax credit should consult their

tax advisor when doing their tax return to be

sure they get the correct amount.

"It's on the taxpayers," he said. "So they
better have the info to back it up."

According to Student Financial
Services, the "Hope Scholarship" entitles
students to a tax break worth 100 percent of
the ﬁrst $1,000 spent on tuition and 50 per-
cent of the next $1,000 spent each year.

In addition to the "Hope Scholarship,"
the Taxpayer Relief Act also enacted the
"lifelong learning" tax credit for third and
fourth year students as well as graduate stu-
dents, according to Student Financial
Services.

The "lifelong learning" credit takes
effect after July 1, 1998 and will be worth up
to 20 percent of the ﬁrst $5,000 paid for
tuition each year, up through the year 2002.

RETIREMENT

Some faculty members fear this
means the University can cancel health
beneﬁts of retirees.

According to Pitt's Chief Financial
Officer Art Ramicone, administrators are
trying to clarify all language to profes-
sors‘ satisfaction.

Some wording changes have already
been made based upon the suggestions
of Pitt law professor William Brown.
Also the human resources department is

Nordenberg declined a request by
University Senate President Gordon
MacLeod to hire outside counsel to
examine the document.

In the meantime, a ﬁnal copy of the
buyout contract and a cover letter from
the provost were mailed to all eligible
professors.

"Now all the documentation is in
their hands, and they have until the end

of March to decide whether to take it or
not," Ramicone said.

Although happy that the administra-
tion has shown a willingness to work out
such issues, some professors think such
problems could have been avoided in the
first place. -

"There is a feeling among many fac-
ulty members that a review by the
Faculty Assembly would have ironed out
all these problems in advance."

Realistic ways to deal with crunch time

Allson Novlckl

Beat the system;
Pitt will help you

Thank you, University of Pittsburgh. It’s*about
time you acted on behalf of the students for a
change.

The “Hope Scholarship,” a newly enacted feder-
al law, provides tax credits for first- and second—year
students who are paying for their education with
cash or loans. Although it was signed last August,
the bill does not take effect until Jan. 1,‘ 1998, so the
tax credit would not be available for students who
pay their tuition invoices before that date.

Pitt normally sets its winter-semester payment
deadlines for December. But this year, Pitt is urging
students who are eligible for the tax break not to pay
their bills until after Jan. 1, with no late fees.

This is a first: Pitt is willing to accept money a
bit late Without a ﬁght.

It’s a surprising change of behavior for a univer-
sity which, just a few weeks ago, was charging stu-
dents late fees for its own mistakes. For example,
Pitt gave larger refunds to some resident students
than it should have, then asked for the money back,
along with late fees that accrued after students paid
their original bills.

In light of that recent fiasco, this is rather unex-
pected, but still appreciated. Pitt will allow students
who are eligible for the tax credit to wait until
January to pay, with no late fees.

Pitt isn’t even going to benefit from this, except
in gaining some of the respect from students whose
tuition makes this school’s existence possible.

This is the kind of effort that students need to see
Pitt make for them. This is something students will
remember when they are alumni and Pitt is asking
them for donations 

. as long as Pitt doesn’t try to bite us from
behind later on.

We’d be really let down if Pitt were to increase
tuition next year‘ by $1,500 because the administra-
tion knew students would be getting it back from the
federal government.

The whole idea of this Hope Scholarship is to
make college more affordable for students, not to
siphon more money for the University out of the tax-
payers’ pockets. .

; This ges.ture_ of concem.for students’ welfare by
the University speaks ‘v“ery""we1l for Pitt’s character.
Just don’t take advantage of us come next year.

columnist

. Forget everything you’ve ever
been told about how to deal with the

intense end-of-the-semester cnmch.

If you’re a ﬁeshman and you’re
struggling with papers and ﬁnals,
ignore advice from your know-it-all
friends. If you’re an upperclassman
and think that you have mastered
time organization and stressology,
you probably haven’t, and you
should stop giving advice to other
students.

Parents, teaching assistants,
ﬁiends and professors carmot help
you by nagging you about “good”
study habits that “really work”

_ It is unfortunate that all this
time we have been lied to and
deceived by people who think there

is only one way to get everything .

done!

Youneedthetruth, andlam
here to give it to you. Here’s what
you do:

1) Most importantly, don’t
sleep. How do you expect to get A’ s
when you spend ﬁve to eight hours
of precious time at night sleeping
when you could be studying?! If
you waste even three hours sleep-
ing, you are willingly giving up
study-tirne and risking your acade-
mic integrity.

Sleep is overrated anyway. You
can always play catch-up on the
weekend or during the break when
you have more time.

If you feel like you are sooooo
tired that you can’t keep your eyes
open, then you must be doing some-
thing wrong. When this happens,
the trick is to stay awake until you
reach the state of delirium, which
depletes any tiredness in your body.
You will know that you have

reached the optimal. state of deliri-
um when everything, including that
little spot on the wall, becomes the
funniest thing you’ve seen since
you were old enough to remember.

2)Limit your diet to drinks and
foods with large amounts of caf-
feine, calories, sugar and carbohy-
drates. Finals week is not the time to
wony about eating healthy!

Kill two birds with one stone
and order take-out food with the
appropriate components mentioned
above and you’re in like Plyrm!
Obviously, pizza is the No. 1 choice
for food because it is cheap, acces-
sible, and it sits well in the fridge for
a few days, but you shouldn’t limit
yourself to just one high fat and
high carbohydrate fast food. 'I‘here’s
more out there.

The most popular choice for
quenching one’s thirst after inhaling
halfa pizza is a high-in-fructose and
com-syrup-carbonated beverage.
Unfortunately, pop does not always
have the desired effect bwause
there’s too much other stuﬁ° in it
besides sugar. To avoid this prob-
lern, get your own tanks (y’lcnow,
the tanks they use for fountain
drinks) and adjust the carbonation
level so that every drink looks and
tastes like mud Hey, it’s a small
price to pay for a few nights of
being alert

Another popular but overrated
beverage is coffee. Coffee is over-
rated because after a while your
body becomes accustomed to high
levels of caffeine. Before you know
it, you’re drinking coffee like a
heroin addict: the more you drink it,
the less your body reacts to it.

It is hard to know exactly when this
is happening, so it is best to solve
the problem before it becomes a
nuisance. You can do this by leam-

THE PITT NEWS

ing to really like the taste of espres-
soorTurkishcoffee and drinking it

‘ by the cup.

3) Neglect friends, family and
boyfriend or girlfriend It is too dis-
tracting to have good company
around who might accidentally, or
purposely, interrupt your studies.
Unplug your phone and don’t
answer the door because whatever
is there may tempt you to remove
yourself from studying.

Emergencies of any kind that
involve your ﬁiends, family or sig-
niﬁcant other should also be
ignored until ﬁnals are totally over.
Emotional and sensitive issues and
events are quite distracting when
you’re trying to concentrate on your
work and read

So what if your friend wants to
cry on your shoulder because her
mother just died? Tell your friend
that you cannot sacriﬁce your own
time for helpless pleas for sympa-
thy. So what if your girlﬁiend is
pregnant and her “ ’s going to
ﬂ1pandbeatyouup”1fheﬁnds
outl? Tell her that she’ll have to deal
with it alone until you’re ﬁnished
studying.

4) Do not attempt to create a
balance between work and pleasme.
Once you turn on the TV or ﬂip on
the radio, all is lost. -Don’t do it To
avoid all temptation, lock yourself
in a room with nothing but a chairto
sit on, a desk to work at, school
work to study and a phone with
which to order food (preferably a
pay phone so you can’t receive
incoming calls).

Alison Novicki has many staﬂers at
The Pitt News concerned that she

won’t be writing next semester;

we ’re afraid she won't come out of
ﬁnals week alive.

THE PITT NEWS

Gocl rest ye merry gentlemen

Dan Ertman

Columnist

I was coming back from
Benedum Hall, having just been
blown off by an advisor and an
associate dean, hell—bent on writ-
ing a scathing and bitter colunm
against these people, when
something unimaginable to me
happened. I looked around, and I
said, “Hey!! You’ve got no real
reason to be pissed! !” You live in
a great (?!?) country, go to a
great (???!!!???) university, and
hell, even if all of that’s a lie,
IT’S ALMOST CHRIST-
MAS!!!!”

Of course, most students
here are way too busy contem-
plating suicide to realize how
close the holidays are. We have
ﬁnals, homework, friends, fami-
ly and pressure from every con-
ceivable angle. We have more
worries than we have ever had in
our lives. We have the threat of
another war with Iraq, ﬁnancial
collapse, AIDS, world hunger,
cancer, alcohol abuse  the list
goes on for pages.

However, you must believe
me when I say that if for one
brief day, or even a couple of
days, you forget your worries
and try to just enjoy life, the
problems will still be there when
you get back, and you can attack
them then. Take a vacation from
life. It’ll be here when you get
back. (NOTE: To all of you who

just misinterpreted what I said, I
am in no way advocating LCD,
marijuana, PCP, crack or heroine
usage. Thank you.)

During World War I, on-
Christmas Eve, for miles and
miles along the huge, reeking,
rat-infested, damp and miserable
trenches, soldiers on both sides
of the line did an amazing thing."
They stopped ﬁring. They just
stopped. “We don’t want to kill
anymore!! It’s Christmas!!” they
cried. Then, slowly at ﬁrst, they
climbed, hobbled in some cases,
out of their dung-strewn homes,
and began to sing Christmas car-
ols together. They hugged,
shared vodka and cigarettes, and,
in general, partied hearty...After
Christmas, the orders came
down from the command posts,
which I’m sure read something
like “WHY THE HELL
AREN’T YOU SHOOTING,
YOU FOOLS?????” and the war
began again.

These soldiers’ lives were
much more unpleasant than any
of ours are. The disgust we all
feel when we think of going to
another day in a McDonald's
kitchen, the sinking feeling
known as Its-midnight-and—I-
haven’t-started-studying-for-
my—8 a.m.—ﬁnal syndrome, the
term papers and the homework
all pale in comparison to what
life in the trenches must have
been like. And yet these soldiers
took time out and dug deep

down inside to find enough hap-
piness to enjoy one lovely day.

Somehow, I think it might do us i

all a bit of good to do the same.
Put down your books for an
hour. Take your truss, put it in a
vice, and “let the glue dry for a
while.” Push your chair back
from your Mathematica termi-
nal. Go out and catch the ﬁrst
bus for downtown.

Get off at Smithﬁeld Street.
Spend time wandering through
Kaufmarm’s department store,
looking for what you’d like to
get for your various holidays.
Promise yourself and me that
you won’t worry about what
you’re going to get for that spe-
cial someone in your life, but just
revel in the commercialism.
Release your inner child, and
roam free for awhile.

If you ﬁnd yourself worry-
ing despite all of my warnings,
chiding and advice, then there
really is only one thing to do.
Run through the doors. Any
doors you want. Go outside of
the building, and look at the win-
dow displays. Look at the anima-
tronics, the fake snow, and
instead of wondering how they
got the little elf to shoot baskets,
ask yourself how they got Santa
to pose for so long.

That, of course, is the most
important part of the Holiday
Spirit. Believe in Santa. Forget
all you’ve heard about anagram-
ming his name and how some of

Thursday, 4 December 1997

 

the department store Santas have
molested small children, and just
take it on faith that he exists.
What do you have to lose? What
great gain do you get by believ-
ing the guy in the suit is an out-
of-work actor who needed this
job to buy liquor, or just some
freak? And just think of how
much you lose.

So be happy for awhile. Call
someone you haven’t talked to
since you got here. Then go back

Chris Taschner/Staff Illustrator

to your studies with a clear mind,
a clear conscience and a clear
heart. Who knows, you might
even be more motivated.
Whatever. And if your professors
say anything, give ‘em a hearty
“Merry Christmas,” hug ‘em,
and walk away. Merry Christmas
to all, and to all a good night.

bility for bad grades received by
people who follow his advice.

norm) was a sign of his lack of support and his own,
perhaps subconscious, homophobia. I simply don’t
believe him when he writes that he went to this
length to protest their tactic.

First of all, don’t you get the joke? Do you
actually believe that we gays and gay supporters
walked around on Nov. 12 counting each piece of
denim as another active supporter of the cause?
Your article seems to be the equivalent of the old
line, “I don’t hate them. Why some of my best
friends are [fill in the minority].”

It comes as no surprise that Mr. Ertman was
able to squeeze the words, “the damn faggots” into

his article. I know. I know. They’re not his words.
He’s simply quoting “them.”

We all have our prejudices and phobias.
Hopefully, we try to work on them and become
beings of compassion and acceptance. I suggest that
Mr. Ertman and all people who were similarly dis-
traught by Gay Jeans Day should I.) have a sense of
humor and 2.) look inside themselves to really see
why they reacted so strongly to this day.

College not a substitute for
military to build character

I have regularly read The Pitt News since I
started attending Pitt, but I must admit that the Nov.
10 “Editor’s Notebook” disappointed me more than
usual. In the commentary about Starship Troopers,
Kris Kissel states he is intrigued by the idea of
earning the privilege of voting -— and then goes on
to state that military service is not the only way to

earn this, and that a “really good” college educa-

tion, supplemented with “a lot of good reading”
should also be adequate.

I find it disturbing that the editor would say this
after already admitting he hasn’t read the novel the
idea comes from. What was that about good sup-
plemental reading? Does the editor believe he
would be qualified to vote under this system? I
hope not. After hearing the editors mewl like kit-
tens about cafeteria food, having to take algebra,
and other such travesties, it worries me that one
might think a college education, albeit a “really
good” one, makes him more qualified to vote than
anybody else.

Perhaps a stint in the infantry would make the
editor a little more aware of what the important
things in life are, and why they are important. And
hopefully, it would show him that it is not the edu-
cation itself which qualifies you for responsibility,
but your character as a human being.

Harris named coach of the year

Orlandini, six other players also honored

Rachel Lenzl
Staff Writer

Walt Harris now has something to
worry about when ‘he walks through the
metal detector at Memphis International
Airport later this month. _

It’s the big trophy he won yesterday
afternoon.

Two days after accepting. a bid to

play in the Liberty  ,
Bowl, Harris was
named the Big East
Coach of the Year,
as selected by the
eight Big East head
coaches.

The coaches

also selected the Big
East Player of the
Year and the All-Big
East Conference
Teams, which
included seven Pitt
players.
Tackle Tony
Orlandini was the lone ﬁrst—team pick,
while quarterback Pete Gonzalez, wide-
out Terry Murphy, guard Jon Marzoch,
rimning back Dwayne Schulters, defen-
sive tackle Frank Moore and linebacker
Phil Clarke all took second-team honors.
Syracuse quarterback Donovan
McNabb was awarded Big East Player
of the Year.

Harris led one of college football’s
biggest tum-arounds this year, guiding
the Panthers to a 6-5 record and upsets
of conference foes such as Virginia Tech

    
 

Pitt football Coach Walt Harris

and Miami en route to a 4-3 Big East
record. .

Harris previously served as a quar-
terbacks coach at Ohio State where his
West Coast offense was a key factor in
the Buckeyes’ 1997 Rose Bowl victory.

He was also a player in the building
of a successful team at the University of
Tennessee, where he served under Pitt
predecessor Johrmy Majors from 1983-
 1988 as assistant
head coach and
offensive coordina-
tor.

After taking
the hehn from
Majors, Harris
brought his previ-
ous successes to
Oakland in
December. In less
than one season,
Harris took the
Panthers from 72-0
blowout Victims (at
the hands of Harris’
OSU offense) to a bowl berth.

The Panthers squeaked out a sea-
son-ending triple-overtime upset of West
Virginia to clinch fourth place in the con-
ference and earn a trip to the Liberty
Bowl, marking the Panthers’ ﬁrst bowl
appearance since 1989.

“Our football team deserves a
chance to play in a bowl game,” Harris
said after the victory over the
Mountaineers. “We earned the right and
we deserve an opportunity. This is the
way college football should be play .”

 

Pitt women downed 72-70 by unbeaten Orange

Column, page 17

Shannon Helm

Staff Writer

Last night the Pittsburgh
Panthers women’s basket-
ball team lost a close Big
East battle, 72-70, to the
undefeated Orangewomen
of Syracuse.

The Lady Panthers had
only one senior in their start-
ing lineup at Syracuse -
Farrah Woods, who totaled
12 points for the Panthers
and added two rebounds.

The rest of the starting

.squad include! an injured ,

veteran, a community-col-

lege transfer, an inexperi-
enced 6—foot-7 center and a
rookie forward.

Junior guard Gina
Montesano, still nursing a
leg injury, led the team in
scoring. She compiled a
team-high 16 points and
added two rebounds to the
effort.

Sophomore center
Nickeia Morris, who aver-
aged barely 11 minutes a
game last year, also helped
Pitt’s cause, scoring double
digits in two categories.

..MorfriWs,_p “contributed K 10‘
rebounds while scoring 13’

points for the Lady Panthers.
LaTonya Blanton,

another junior guard whose‘

previous college experience
came at Central Florida
Community College, con-
tributed seven total points.

Compiling a team-high
four assists, along with four
points and five rebounds
was the freshman starter,
Rasheedah Akram.

Junior forward Alecia
Balich, coming off the
bench, sank three three-
pointers in four tries on the
way tq a,pl4-point night. W

Overall, the “ Lady’

Panthers shot a respectable
.540 percent and actually
outscored the Orangewomen
43-39 in the second half. But
the play of Raquel Nurse (19
points, nine boards) and
Teakyta Barnes (18, eight)
was enough for Syracuse to
earn the win.

The loss takes
Pittsburgh’s season record to
2-3, 0-1 in the Big East. The
Lady Panthers will next take
on the Wildcats of Villanova
in their second Big East
matchup of the season. The
game will beheld on Sunday
at FitzgeraIdlField House“.

Not just a bowl game.

Not just the ﬁnal game for 16 great
Panther seniors.

You have a chance to see the arguably
greatest monument in the world.

Graceland.

Plain and simple, even if you don’t go to
the game you have to visit the home of the
King. Even if you don’t know Pete
Gonzalez from Juan Gomalez, or Speedy

enjoy Pittsburgh fever while it lasts.

Memphis has so much to offer the yinz—

Beale Street makes C zusoii Street in the

Although a lot more happens on Oakland

Nevertheless, Memphis is packed with

Graceland admission is only $10, and

Grube, Meece break school records otswimming tourneys

Patrick Robertson

Staff Wrlter

Both the men’s and women’s swim-
ming and diving teams have hit a lull in their
schedules with the Thanksgiving and winter
breaks, but they have not let this slow them
down. A

The women traveled to Indiana
University the weekend of Nov. 22 and 23
and came away with a second place ﬁnish in
the Indiana Invitational, just behind the host
Hoosiers.

The Lady Panthers had some very
strong performances from veterans
Samantha Chabotar and Jamie Tomazich,
but it was a sophomore sensation that set the
pace. And a record, just for good measure.

\\
\\\‘\

Senior Tomazich ﬁnished third in the 3-
meter diving event with a total score of
469.40 and captured ﬁrst place in the 1-
meter with a score of 404.50.

Junior Chabotar ﬁnished second in the
500—yard freestyle, fourth in the 400 individ-
ual medley and ﬁrst in the 1650 freestyle.

“I am very pleased with the way she is
swimming. She’s swimming better races and

‘better times than this time last year,” Head

Coach Marian‘ Cassidy-Keen said

These Pitt performances earned impor-
tant meet points; sophomore Beth Grube did
a bit. more. She broke the school mark in the
200 backstroke and ﬁnished ﬁrst with a time
of 2:02.74.

“Beth swarn a great race for us,”
Cassidy-Keen said of the record breaker,

ATHLETIC DIRECTOR STEVE PEDERSON

In appreciation for the tremendous support and
enthusiasm of the student body during the 1997 Football
season, Chancellor Mark N ordenberg and Athletic Director
Steve Pederson are pleased to announce that any University
of Pittsburgh student attending the 1997 Liberty Bowl will
receive a complimentary game ticket. All students must
pick up their game ticket in Memphis, TN on Tuesday,
December 30th, from 2:00pm - 4:00pm in the lobby of the

0 Adams Mark Hotel located at 939 Ridge Lake Boulevard,
Memphis, TN 38120, or at the Pittsburgh Panther players’
gate at the Liberty Bowl starting 90 minutes before the
game. All students MUST SHOW A VALID ID CARD
TO PICK UP THEIR TICKET. To reserve your ticket or
to get more details, please inquire at the William Pitt Union
Ticket Office or call 648-7814.

 

who also took ﬁrst in the 100 backstroke.

The Lady Panthers ﬁnished wiﬂr 998
points, 71 behind the Hoosiers. The Panthers
ﬁnished ahead of Cincinnati, Arkansas and
Kentucky.

“Overall we’re in better shape and
we’re swimming a lot better than this time
last year,” Chabotar said of her teammates. ’

The men’s team traveled to the
University of North Carolina for the Nike
Invitational and brought back a ﬁfth place
ﬁnish, with Texas A&M winning the event.
Pittsburgh racked up 424.50 points corn-
pared to the Aggies’ 649.

before the Nike meet, and while it sapped the
squad’s energy, it did little to inﬂate its mood.

“The Princeton meet was blah,” Knoles
said.

The team had only two and ahalfdays
of rest before going to North Carolina after a
tough week of practice and the Princeton
scrimmage.

Still, the squad notched some victories.
Pittsburgh’s 200 medley relay team of Brian
Elko, Devin Meece, Jon Haggerty and Jerry
Koller captured ﬁrst place with a time of
1 132.04. The 400 medley team also took ﬁrst
place with the same members.

Freshman Meece set a school record in
the 200 breaststroke while swimming to a
ﬁrst place ﬁnish with a time of 2:01.13. The
old record, set in 1992 by Don Boyd, stood
at 2:01.16.

“We were pretty tired, but we are start-
ing to swim like men,” Knoles said

Freshman Joe Stone made an impres-
sive Nike Cup debut, earning a second place
ﬁnish in the 100 breaststroke.

The best Panther diver of the weekend,
George Anderson, managed only a seventh
place ﬁnish in the l—meter event.

The men’s team looks to improve over

our ﬁeestyle events are damn weak.”

includes a round trip bus ticket, a one—night
stay at the Days Inn at Memphis, a ticket to
the game and a shuttle service that runs to
the game from the hotel. V

The bus leaves the University at 6 p.m.
on Dec. 30 and is scheduled to arrive in
Memphis around 10 am. on Dec. 31.

One possible drawback is that the bus
leaves for Pittsburgh on New Year’s Day at
9 am.. It is scheduled to arrive in town at 11
p.m. Prices for the package are, per person,
$193 for a double, $180 for a triple, $170 for
a quad and $220 for a single.

Pitt Program Council is also running a
bus trip to Memphis. The package is $139
per person and includes a round trip bus
ticket, a two-night stay at the Holiday Irm-
Mount Moriah and tickets to the game. The
bus leaves the Vlfrlliam Pitt Union on Dec.
29 at 11 pm and is scheduled to arrive in
Memphis around 2 pm on Dec. 30. Shuttles
will take students from the hotel to the
Liberty Bowl. The bus then leaves Memphis
for Pittsburgh on Jan. 1 at a time to be deter-
mined. The package is non—refundable. '

Forbes Travel is also putting together a
bus package that will be available at the end
of the week. It is taking reservations now
and will contact customers when the pack-
age is complete.

USAirways is offering some of the
cheapest rates if you plan on ﬂying. A round
trip ticket to Memphis (leaving Pittsburgh
on Dec. 30 and coming back on Jan. 1) is

$282.
