Cast Selected
By M arlatt

“All to the Point” Starts
Rehearsals; Based on
School’s Founding

-Choruses Practice Daily

“All to the Point,” a romance of
early Pittsburgh and the founding of
-the University, is the name of the
1933 Cap and Gown show which is
now in rehearsal. William Marlatt,
director of the production, has select-
ed his cast, the choruses, and an
octette, and reports that production
and business staffs are beginning
work.

The revue is billed for the Nixon
Theater the week of Ap-ril 24. The
libretto of G. Norman Reis is being
used. Concerned in the story is Judge
Henry Brackenridge, the founder of
the Pittsburgh Academy. Around him
is built a cast of characters ranging
from Corn Planter, the Indian chief,
to Jennie and Jeannie, two students
in Mrs. Pride’s School for sewing and
cooking.

Craig Forbes is the Eastern visitor
who falls in love with Melissa Mar-
bury, the beautiful niece of Major
Marbury, commandant at Fort Pitt.
The situation becomes complicated
when the villain, an Indian trader
named Joe Briggs, attempts to win the
girl. Briggs, after trying to become
a hero 1n the young lady’s eyes, is re-
vealed by Forbes. There is a happy
ending.

Among the remarks of the charac-
ters are interspersed songs, dances,
and novelty numbers to round out the
extravaganza. Every member of the
cast and of the chorus, it is said,
takes part in at least one musical
number.

‘_‘All parts for the show,” Marlatt
said yesterday, “have been ﬁlled, but

we may rearrange some of the charac- ‘

ters. Probably by Friday we should
have a deﬁnite list selected.”

Members of the cast are Carl
Schwartz, John Wyeth, Bernard Ro-
senson, Allan Divers, Joseph Samson,
Alfred Knauss, Robert Connolly, Joe
Tormey, James Holland, James Mc-
Cormick, Robert McCune, Norman
Wolken, Marshall Baker, Robert
Haase, Richard Lambie, Richard Fisk,
Howard Kleeb, James Burns, Hubert
Wagner, Richard Ohl, William Moran,
T. Winston McConkey, James Hub-
bard, and Robert Young.

The octette will include Paul J.
Whelan, Arnold Suba, Francis Doran,
Robert Smith, Paul Mitchell, Benja-
min Weiss, Fred W. Schuster, and
Ralph Snively.

In the girls’ chorus will be Robert
McFarland, Duncan Montgomery,

Cummins, Louis Hay, Maurice Fier-

man, Charles Hiles, Melvin Vatz,
George Stocker, Clifton Brittain,

Inquiry To Hear Talk
Tomorrow On Banking

After a three-weeks’ series of re-
ligious discussions, in which each of
the three major faiths was outlined,
the Inquiry Forum returns to current
political and economic problems to-
morrow. At the regular meeting at
12:30 o’clock, Professor Montfort
Jones, professor of ﬁnance in the
School of Business Administration,
will outline “The Banking Situation.”

The speaker will outline the growth
of the tense condition in ﬁnancial af-
fairs, and will point out its probable
effects. Included in the survey of
American banking practices will be
comparisons with the Canadian and
English systems, and the value of
both American and British banking in
the economic structure of the world.

The climax in German politics will
be featured during the next few
weeks. It has been planned that two
meetings will be devoted to the p-re-
sentation of the two opposing view-
points in German political theory. In
addition, the farm situation will also
merit attention of the Forum within
a. month.

The speaker for next week has not
yet been deﬁnitely chosen. Either
Father Ross of the Sacred Heart
Church or Dr. Thomas S. Baker, presi-
dent of Carnegie Tech will begin the
German series. Dr. Baker has re-
cently returned from Germany, and
has addressed audiences in the city on
the rise of Hitlerism.

Fraternities
Have Forums

Greeks Pick Three Topics;
Y Provides Speakers

Starting next Monday, ﬁfteen social
fraternities are each to conduct Mon-
day night forums until April 3 on sub-
jects ranging from religion to inter-
national relations and from personal-
ity to marital companionships. This

marks the fourth year of participation_

for the fraternities since the forums’
institution by the YMCA.

Each fraternity is permitted to
choose the three subjects it would
like to have discussed at its own three
meetings. Questionnaires containing
a prepared list of ﬁfteen questions
were distributed last week by Mr.
Theodore Biddle, assistant to the dean
of men; from these, fraternities were
to have indicated their choices and re-
turned their answers yesterday.

At least twenty different speakers
are to speak in the course of the
three weeks, Faculty men, commu-
nity leaders, ministers, rabbis, and
business men are to be drafted, and
no man will speak twice at the same
house.

The speakers are to dine at the fra-
ternity houses, and, immediately after
supper, are to conduct the forums
which are to last upwards of an hour.
Following the meetings, chapter presi-
dents are to make reports to Biddle as
to what degree of enjoyment and gen-
eral knowledge their groups gained
by the discussions.

Glee Club Returns From
Intercollegiate Contest

The Men's Glee Club returned to
Pittsburgh Saturday after taking part
in the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate
Glee Club Contest in Philadelphia Fri-
day evening. At Gettysburg, Thurs-
day, the group gave a concert before
the Lion’s Club.

Entered in the contest were glee
clubs from Pitt, Penn State, Haver-
ford, Westchester State Teachers’ Col-
lege, and Temple_ The affair, under
the auspices of the Philadelphia
Forum, was given in the Philadelphia
Academy of Music. Each competing
group sang one choral number, one
prize song, and one college song. The
Penn State Glee Club was named win-
ner.

Following the contest, all clubs
combined to sing ensemble numbers.
The Swarthmore mixed chorus also
entertained. Thirty men represented
Pitt in the Philadelphia competition,
the ﬁrst Pitt has entered in several
years.

Coed Chairman Named

 

Gladys Pyle, Col. ’33, was se-
lected by Studentcouncil late
yesterday afternoon to serve
as coed co-chairman of Spring
Festival. -Miss Pyle, a mem-
ber of Delta Delta Delta and

last Wednesday's Council meet-
ing at the request of WSGA.

Panhel  Dinner

Is Replaced

By High; Tea

Fraternity Women Choose
Inexpensive Affair
Over Banquet

—-————-—-—-—.—

Play To Be Presented

At the weekly Panhellenic meeting
last Thursday, it was decided that
High Tea next Thursday night at
Heinz House, from 5:30 to 8 o’clock,
should replace the annual banquet
for fraternity women.

Up to this time, it was traditional
to hold a formal banquet every year
for fraternity women. The decision
of the organization to dispense with
the more elaborate affair in favor of
High Tea is a concession to the pres-
ent economic conditions, since many
of the fraternity women could not
otherwise afford to come to the major
event of Panhellenic’s schedule for
the year.

The program to be presented at
High Tea, which is under the charge
of Betty Quarrie, Col, ’34, will be a
play containing two acts. Sunny
Vi/eslager, who graduated from the
University of Pittsburgh last year,
wrote the play. The dramatic presen-
tation deals with fraternity life under
conditions existing twenty—ﬁve years
ago, and,ns_it. w.ilL,.be _hypothetically
twenty—ﬁve years from now. The play-
wright selected the phase of frater-
nity rushing during these two periods.

At the tea, the fraternity having the
highest scholastic average for the
past semester of this year and the
ﬁrst semester of the year before, will
receive the scholarship silver cup
awarded annually by the Panhellenic
Council. Beta Sigma ‘Omicron led last
year with a quality point average of
2.11. The year before, Delta Phi Ep-
silon won the silver cup.

The fraternity committee, invited
as honorary guests at the affair, in-
clude Miss Ellen M. Geyer, associate
professor of education; Mrs. Lotte
Lohstoeter, assistant professor of
modern languages; Miss Thyrsa W.
Amos, dea.n of women; Miss I-Ielen P.
Rush, assistant to the dean of women.

Lois Boggs, Ed. ’33, social chairman,
is in charge of the arrangements for
the tea.

Where Do We Stand Now?

An Editorial

1 ITH “Beer by April” the cry from press and legisla-
ture, one wonders what reception will be given the re-
turn of the “brew of Democracy” by the college student-—

when and if such a return is

accomplished.

What proportion, for instance, of our own student body
favors the legalized manufacture and sale of beer that con-
tains more than three per cent of alcohol?

How many of these are “drinkers” under the present
system of Prohibition enforcement?

How many Pitt students, men and women, would favor
legalization of beer and wine as an economic measure bring-
ing increased employmentand federal revenue, even though
they frown upon the change for moral reasons?

These are some of the questions that should be answered
by college men and women before the time for either
protest or approval of legislative action is past. The opinion
of the generation of citizens upon whom the effects of the
change will fall is one worth hearing. And that generation
is well represented on the college and university campuses

of the country.

Prohibition polls held here and elsewhere in the past
have failed to give an expression of student feeling that
could be taken seriously. There was little reason then for
the results to have been given serious thought. Until re-
cently, the chances of repeal were remote. In the minds of
many, what they said for or against prohibition mattered
little. Consequently, the questionnaires received the same
treatment as did the Eighteenth Amendment itself—both

were taken as grand jokes.

But today the very imminence of beer legalization
should have a sobering ezlfect on the manner in which stu-
dent sentiment is voiced. With the passage of a Congres-
sional bill for the “tempering of temperance” seemingly in-
evitable, both those who favor and those who oppose the
present measure will see to it that their feelings on the ques-
tion are made to count. Perhaps now, on the very eve of
the change, we can expect students to speak as they think.

It is not ﬂattery to ourselves or others to state that the
world is interested in hearing what the college student has
to say. Things actually got that bad. So, if there is to be
any reply at all, let us have, for once and for all, the genuine

one.

After all, “What about beer?”

At a meeting yesterday, Student
Relations Committee granted a temp-
orary charter to a student branch of
the League for Social Justice, nation-
al liberal organization.

Sponsors of the group applied for
recognition several months ago, but
the association was not approved un-
til yesterday's meeting. The temp-
orary charter, as given, will hold‘ good
only until June 7, and necessitates ap-
plication by the group next year for
a permanent charter.

The League's purpose, as explained
by its constitution, is “To foster in
students an intelligent approach to
the study of the problems of social
and economic instability and, by
sponsoring lectures and intimate con-
tact with those most vitally affected
by such instability as well as by
group discussion and the sharing of
personal philosophies, to provide the
students the opportunity to study the
situations that surround them and to
apply the principles and postulations
expounded in the classroom to mat-
ters of vital concern to students and
society.”

The program of the League for the
remainder of the semester has not yet
been deﬁnitely planned, but will
chiefly include discussion groups and
meetings before which outstanding
thinkers and speakers will take up
the problems of the present time.

This student branch of the League
is affiliated with the executive com-
mittee of the Pittsburgh League for
Social Justice, under the chairman-
ship of Dr. B. J. Hovde, associate pro-
fessor of history, and the vice-chair-
manship of Dr. Ralph S. Boots, pro-

Poll Results Scrapped

Members of the senior class today
were being askedlby mail for a new
expression of preference on the mat-

the graduating class another week in
which to voice his preference.

Those seniors who have not yet
seen the new type diploma are in-
vited to view them any time before
next Tuesday at the registrar’s of-
ﬁce.

It was stated yesterday by Regis-
trar John G. Quick that no action
would be taken to change the type of
diploma from its present scroll un-
less a clear majority of the senior
class had registered its preference

Dr. Elmer Will Discuss
Jewish Families Friday

 

“The Jewish Family” will be dis-

the sociology department at the next
YM and WHA Student Council lunch-
eon discussion group which will take
place Friday at 12:30 o’clock in the
private dining room of the “Y” res-
taurant.

Dr. Elmer is an expert on the fam-
ily and has written several books on
the subject.

The Student Council luncheon dis-
cussions have been meeting regularly
every alternate Friday, Harry Cap-
lan, Col. ’33 chairman of the group
invites all students to attend.

The results of votes cast by students
in the College, Graduate School, and
,School of Education, Business Ad-
I ministration, Engineering and Mines
last week were being “scrapped” in
favor of the present poll by mail, it
was announced.

The decision to get a complete con-
sensus from the senior class followed
a formal protest from Student Coun-
cil last week, in which it was alleged
that the University had failed to get
a representative expression of opin-
ion on the diploma question.

Registrar Quick and other members
of the administration expressed com-
'plete surprise at the interpretation
placed upon their “attempt ‘to submit
the question to vote at announced
meetings of seniors from the non-
professional schools. The registrar
said it had been his hope, as the ad-
ministrative officer handling the
school meetings, to get an expres-
sion of the majority opinion of the
g1‘011Ds attending.

VVhen it was apparent that there
was only a ten per cent attendance at
the meeting of the College and Edu-
cation seniors, the only groups to dis-
approve of the -book-type diploma,
Registrar Quick said it was decided to
continue the recording of preference
as seniors called to apply -for gradu-
3111011. This was done in special con-
sideration of these groups, he said.

It was pointed out that at no time
was it the intention of the Univer-
sity to “railroad” a change over stu-
dent opinion, as was intimated in the
Drotest from «Student Council.

Complete returns for the Engineer-

place at the Grotto ball room on the
Northside, March 10, indicate a bet-

fair, according to E. H. R. Pegg, ’33,
president of the association.

“Friends of the Engineering School
who have _been attending Association
dances for years assured us that the
last one was the ‘ﬁnest dance in As-
sociation history,’ and we ourselves
are delighted,” declared Pegg. He
also commended the cooperation ac-
corded him by his committee com-‘
posed of the 11 other members of the
Association Cabinet.

The dance was carried through that
week despite the rigors of a general
student cash shortage caused by the
national banking holiday. The Asso-
ciation, however, aided the cause of
undergraduates who desired to attend
the dance but who could not at the

Work on phases of production from
Alpha to Omega was described by
Dr. Edward R. Weidlein, .director of
the Mellon Institute of Industrial Re-
search, yesterday when he presented
to the board of trustees his report for
the ﬁscal year, March 1, 1932, to
March 1, 1933.

Sixty-seven industrial fellowships,
employing 137_ scientists, have been
in operation during the past year; at
the »b.e.gi.nn_iI._1g of the new I>e..ri.0_d 5.5
fellowships, three less than on March
1, 1932, employed 98 researchers. Twen-
tyvsix of these have been at work for
ﬁve Years or more, fourteen have con-
cluded ten years of research, and nine
fellowships have been operating over

. ﬁfteen years.

In the last year, $616,360 was re-
ceived by the Institute from fellow-
ship donors to defray costs of scien-
tiﬁc researches conducted for these
companies and associations. Money
expended for this purpose during
twenty-two year period, "1911-1933, to-
itals nearly $9,000,-000. ‘
According to the report, investiga-
tions were conducted in ﬁelds includ-
ing paper, steel, rosin, glass, tobacco,

Dean S. Hubbel, industrial fellow,
evolved a new product of cement-

poses. “'I‘hi-s,” according to Dr. Weid-
lein, “is one of the most promising
discoveries in the ﬁeld, ‘because it has

System Into

A method of nomination based on
the system now used for nominating
candidates for the University Award
was one of the m_ost important fea-
tures of the constitution which the
Delta chapter of Druids, national hon-
orary sophomore men’s activities fra-
ternity, recently adopted.

gan collaborating with medical spe-.

Commenting on the change, Presi-
E dent Joseph Novak, Col., said, “Druids
}have, in the past, -been accused, per-
Ihaps justly, of not giving full consid-
eration to all who were worthy of
nomination principally because these
individuals were not known to mem-
bers of the organization. Criticism
has also been made that, because of

limited members_hip and because of
fraternity alliance, certain men had
not even been nominated. The new
system tries to remove the cause for
any of the criticism to which the or-
ganization has -been subjected, ‘Under
it, any undergraduate student who is
eligible may secure a petition from
the office of the dean of men, ﬁll it
out properly, and return it to the of-
ﬁce within a speciﬁed time, thus auto-
matically nominating himself.”

“The new method of nomination to
membership,” said Theodore W. Bid-
dle, assistant to the Dean of Men,
“will make Druids _an organization
open to all.”

The system is quoted here as it
appears In the copy of the constitu-
tion on ﬁle in the office of the Dean
of Men:

1. Nominations:

a. Nominations may be made by the mem-
bership of Druids at a meeting called
distinctly for this purpose at least ten
days before the time of election.
Petitions for nomination may be made
by the student body at large when at
the regular nomination meeting such
petitions shall be regarded as nomina-
tions and accordingly nominated in the
prescribed manner by the membership.

A trick frequently worked in cigarette

in a cigarette comes from mysterious
processes of manufacture.
EXPLANATION: All popular ciga-

baccos.

rettes today are made in modern sani-

tary factories with up-to-dat_e machin-
ery. All are heat treated—some more
intensively than others, because raw,
inferior tobaccos require more inten-

 

sive treatment than choice, ripe to-

The real difference comes in the to-
baccos that are used. The better the
tobacco, the milder it is.

‘ It is ca fact, .welI-‘known byleof
tobacco experts, that Cgmels
are made from f-iner, MO-RE
EXPENSIVE tobaccos than any other
popular brand. I

That is why Camels are so mild. That
is why Camels have given more pleas-
ure to more people than any other cig-
arette ever made.

It’s the secret of Camels’ rich “bou-
quet”. . . their cool ﬂavor .  their non-
irritating mildness.

Give your taste a chance to appre-
ciate the greater pleasure and satisfac-
tion of the more expensive tobaccos.

When Greek meets Greek, One,
might easily be lead to believe that
another restaurant is in the offing.
But not so, tomorrow evening In the
Stadium; instead the greeks are 80-
ing to dish up some action in the
way of two ‘basketball games, begin-
ing at 7:30 o’clock. The ‘BOYS and
girls who will gather around the Pa-
vilion court will have a ﬁne OPPOI‘
tunity to learn what results when
campus greeks oppose campus gI‘eekS-

The gross result in tomorrow's ac-
tivity will be the crowning of the
1933 interfraternity basketball cham-
pions and the net result will be the
awarding of several mantelpiece troph-
ies to the winners. But in between

——there’s the story-

Beginning at 7:30 runners-up in the
Alpha and Beta leagues, Omega Delta
and Delta Tau Delta, will ﬁght it out
for the second place D0Siti01‘1 and A1111}?-
Phi Delta and Phi Delta Theta, will
contest each other’s right t0_ the be‘
called interf-raternity champions.

Neither the Alpha Phi Delta nor
the Phi Delta’.s have lost a game 111
their respective leagues, both teams
holding a clear record of six victories
against no losses in league competi-
tion, the other contestants having lost
one game each. _ _

What a football player looks like in
a. basketball unifgorm will -be demon-
strated in the championship tussle.
The Phi Delts hold options on the
services, of “Howdy” Ode-11, “B0b'bY"
Hoel, and “Pinny” Heller, who have
demonstrated their athletic versatil-
ity by being lead-ing scorers in the
all-fraternity loop. Odell holds down
the forward position with Keckler.
With Heller and Hoel at guards.

Although the "Alpha, Phi’s don’t go
in for ends, tackles, and half-backs,
Emil Bonavita, Coach Olsenls weight
thrower extraordinary, has been one
of the mainstays in the Delts cham-
ponship climb, and backed by Pingi-
tore, Pugia, Adonizio, and Ferrarro,
they hold a slight edge over their
league -A opponents.

Showing that the brother act still
holds sway at Pitt, the Omega Delts
will show off their Vvhitaker brothers
in their game against the Delta Taus.
P, Whitaker as forward and brother
D, at center, which will be bounded
on both sides by Anderson, Teats, and
Meyer, to confront the best which
the Delta Taus will offer, which will
-be plenty.

On paper, one of the most consist-
ent high scorers of both leagues, the
Delta Tau Deltas will bring out of
hiding a few more of Dr. Sutherland’s
pupils when Hartwig and Hogan toss

under the basket shots instead of
forward passes. Wilkinson, Green,
and Smith will be the other three-
ﬁfths of the quintet.

The winners in both the champion-
ships and consolation divisions to-
morrow evening will play -Carnegie

An order for an extra batch of pa-
per and sharpened pencils rang out
from the oﬁice of the dean of men
the other afternoon. A. traditional
campus institution had gone into con-
ference. Another “All-America”
Board had gone into a huddle.

Hours later, after Miss Beatty’s
typewriter had made the committee’s
ﬁndings legal, Theodore Biddle as
chairman of the “board” made his an-
nual announcement, “We met, we de-
cided, and there you are”—and the
1933 fraternity basketball stars were
named,

As in previous years, the Interfra-
ternity “A11-America” committee, an-
nounces today its grand and honor-
able mentions in the A-B leagues of
the Greek loop, to close the annual
fraternity basketball tournament.

Four teams have been drawn up for
the two leagues——ﬁrst and second in
each division—with substitution mate-
rial for all of the teams. '

In League A, the Alpha Phi Deltas,
Omega Deltas, and Phi Gamma Deltas,-
each, have been accorded two posi-
tions on the two league A teams, with
the Alpha Phi and Omega Deltas
placing a man in each team, while the
Phi Gams have placed two men in the
second team of the A league.

Jack Rabin, Theta Chi leading
scorer in both leagues, with a total’
of 70 points in six games, has been.
name_d,cen_ter, ﬂanked onthe forward
side by Jack Obley, Theta Delta Psi
and Robert Berman, Phi Epsilon Pi,
who followed Rabin in the individual
honors race, and on the guard side by
Emil Bonavita, Alpha Phi Delta and
William Meyer, Omega Delta.

Three grand mentions went to
Delta Tau Delta in the league B se-
lection, placing two men on the ﬁrst
team, and one on the second team.
To Kappa Sigma, with two selections
on the ﬁrst team, and Phi Delta
Theta, one on each team, went second
honors.

«Howard Odell, Robert Hogan,
Charles Hartwig, and Robert Tim-
mons, four of Dr. Suther1and’s pupils
were named on the league B star
team, with Richard Wettack of Kappa
Sigma the lone non-footballer appear-
ing on that team.

On the second team have been-
placed Roy Heckler, Phi Delta Theta,
Henry Schilit, Sigma Alpha Mu, Jules
Green, Pi Lambda Phi, Paul Kappa-
way, Lambda Chi Alpha, and Arnold
Greene, Delta Tau Delta.

Tomorrow evening at the close of
the fraternity championship the 1933
All-Fraternity team will be chosen, to
be made up of the four competing.
teams for the leagues’ championship
and consolation teams.

Championships In AAU Meet

Pitt Boxer
Retains Title

Schricker Keeps I55 ll). Title
lay Deteating John Gallo

One championship and a runner-up
post belongs to the Pitt boxing team
as a result of the~indi-vidual champion-
ships of the Eastern Boxing Confer-
ence held at Morgantown Saturday
night. .

Titles were awarded in seven
classes, with the West Virginia mitt-
men’ heading the list with three cham-
pionships, Jack Schricker, defending
155 pound champion retained his title
by outslugging and outboxing John
Gallo, West Virginia. Jimmy Gian-
natti, Pitt lightweight, lost a heart-

breaking decision to Neely, West Vir-~

ginia, after it appeared that Giannatti
had won two of the three rounds.

Pete D’Allesandro, classy Temple
pbantamweight, easily retained his title
by car?‘/lug Braine, Duquesne, for
the three rounds. In the feather-
weight class, Puglia, West Virginia,
barely gained a decision from Kielb,
Bucknell. Neely, West Virginia,
gained the unanimous decision of
both judges and the referee over
Jimmy Giannatti, Pitt. The score
cards of the various coaches at the
ringside gave the ﬁght to Giannatti,
but the votes of the ofﬁcials were the
ones to go on record.

Freddie Moore, Duquesne welter-
weight, was handed a decision over
Towers Hamilton, VVest Virginia, in
the tamest title bent on the card.
Schricker, winning the ﬁrst and third
rounds, was given a split decision
over Gallo, West Virginia. The crowd,
prepared for such a decision, re-
ceived the decision with loud booing
that continued to the end of the last
ﬁght of the evening. This was done
despite the fact that the mountaineer
boxer was out on his feet at the ﬁnish,
according to Hime Cohen, boxing
manager.

Nick Dallis, W. & J., defeated Voor-
hees, West Virginia, to gain the title
in the 165-pound class, and only a.
last round rally enabled Payne, West
Virginia, to gain a decision over
Pilconis, Temple, in '-the 175.

Rabid West Virginia fans did the
boxing game no good by slugging the
referee after the ﬁnal ﬁght, supposed-
ly for the decision in the Schricker-
Gallo ﬁght.

Ruth Hamilton Says Eight

Named For Senior Queen

Ruth Hamilton, Ed. ’33, chairman
of the nominating commttee for se-
lection of the -senior queen, announces
that eight senior women have been
nominated for the position of queen.
These selections were made from the
ballots placed by senior women last
week and will not be announced until
the entire retinue for the ceremony
has been decided on. In former years
only six women have been named,
but it was decided that two could not
be eliminated and still represent the
choice of the class.

Senior Court will place the remain-
der of the women of the class in the
positions for the coronation cere-
mony, and it is now working on the
list in conjunction with the nominat-
ing committee. Only women who
have participated in some activities
and have a C average will be con-
sidered.

The six nominees“ remaining after
the elections will represent Justice,
Wisdom, Mercy, Truth, Valor, and
the chief standard bearer.

The names of the nominees and the
entire retinue for the ceremony will
be announced soon.

Pitt Cagers
Beat Tart-ans

Panthers Easily Win Season's
Last Cage Game, 38-2|

with the pig-skin toters taking the
spotlight once again with spring train-
ing up on the hill, Pitt’s basketeers
made their ﬁnal bow with a pretty 38-
21 victory over the Tartan boys from
across the valley. Sixteen out of
twenty-one on the right side of the
ledger is the record for Doc Carlson’s
cagers this season, with the laurels of
the Intercollegiate Conference al-
ready under their belts.

It took the Panthers a little time to
get warmed up to the evening’s busi-
ness but with the beginning of the
second half the boys got serious and
began to take the Scotchmen for the
well‘ known “ride.” The Tartans led
for a few minutes at the start of the
game; the Pitt boys caught up and
passed them‘ slightly at the half with
17-13; and the second half was all
Pitt.

Don Smith was the star of the
game as far as Pitt was concerned
and the Panther captain ended his
college cage career in a blaze of
glory. Jimmy Fergus, Tech’s co-cap-
tain, was the game’s leading scorer
and contributed ten points for his side
in his last game as a college player.

The freshman cagers closed an un-
defeated season with an easy 44-20
victory over the Tech Plebes.

A discussion of the methods of in-Ipnon,

struction, the implications, and the
value of European history featured
the third annual History Conference
here Saturday. The conference, deal-
ing with “European History and Its
Teaching,” tookplace in the building
of the Western Pennsylvania His-
torical Society and in‘ Heinz House.

Meetings were given under the
auspices of the history department
headed by Dr. John W. Oliver. A

proximately three hundred history in-
structors attended the conclave.

Professor A. H. Sweet, of Washing-
ton and‘ Jeﬁerson College‘, spoke be-
fore the luncheon meeting on ‘.‘Insight
and Insp,-ira_tion.” A plea for truth in
recording historical facts, and for in-
spiration in their teaching,‘ featured
Professor Sweet’s address.

In the dinner session, Mrs. Ruth
Crawford Mitchell, adviser on the na-
tionality rooms for the Cathedral of
Learning, discussed “Central Euro-
pean backgrounds‘ in Western Penn-
sylvania.” Mrs. Mitchell stressed the
cosmopolitan nature of Central Euro-

cent has been their effect upon this
district.

On the program committee were Dr.

Not In the By-Laws

NOW is the time for undergraduates and alumni organizations to
compare aims and ideals with their records of useful service.
It is possible that some University groups might ﬁnd themselves
lacking in evidence convincing enough to substantiate their claims
of idealistic purpose.

I If inspiration is needed to set the inactive to work, they might
consider the program recently inaugurated by the Dental Alumni
‘Association for the beneﬁt of its members. Through its Study Club
committee, this association has provided a series of dental practice
clinics for members who desire post-graduate work in the school in-
iirmary. No charge is made for the course of clinic instruction, al-
though the course, lasting for an eight-week period, would normally
bring a ﬁfty-dollar fee from each registrant.

Members of the Dental faculty are giving freely of their own
time for the daily clinic work and the series of evening lectures.
And as an evidence of the value placed upon this particular program
by the thankful recipients, more than 200 members had registered
for the course last week.

Students who are banded together for mutual beneﬁt, either in
scholastic or activities organizations, might apply the program pur-
pose expressed by the Dental Alumni Association to their own plans,
namely: “that the association may become increasingly useful to its
members.”

We could do well with more such statements of a willingness to
serve. And we would not be forced to look very far to ﬁnd use for
the actual service that would be expected to follow.

Smoking Rooms Promised

TIIE provision of smoking rooms for men and women in the more

frequented campus buildings has been promised the student body
for next year, it was reported at last week’s meeting of Student
Council.

According to Investigations Chairman Wilkison, Mr. John
Weber, University business manager, has stated that smoking rooms
for both sexes would be ready for use in Alumni Hall and the Ca-
thedral of Learning next September. 

Although the need for such space is and has been acute all year,
Council and the student body in general will be satisﬁed to put up
with present conditions for the comparatively short time remaining
this semester on the promise of adequate facilities in the future. The
change, advocated by the News and carried to the administration for
action by Student Council, will be one of tremendous beneﬁt to
everyone concerned, once it is accomplished.

In the past and even now, the failure to provide smoking rooms
has resulted in conditions that are at once abominable in themselves
and detrimental to the attempts that are constantly being made to
preserve the dignity of the University buildings. The promised
change will remove an unfair handicap from those undergraduates

AS HAS been amply demonstrated in the past two weeks, the ma-
chinery of American government moves with greatest speed
when vested interests are caught oﬁ guard. Our President proposed
slashes in veterans’ compensations, and before the American Legion
could assemble its telegram-written shock troops, the Senate and

O

lobbying of an organizewd minority,
nothing of the sort is true. Last
week's passage of the economy bill
was only the opening gun in the bat-
tle. That bill does not reduce vet-
erans’ compensations. It merely gives
the President the right to do the job.
Half-Won Battle

Clearly this is the shifting of an un-
popular responsibility. It is, among
other things, a demonstration of how
a Chief Executive can get action from
a timid, half-willing legislative body.
Members of the 73rd Congress will,
of course, suffer some unpopularity
for their action in this matter. But
now that the word to make the reduc-
tions must come from the executive
department, the bulk of the disap-
proval will fall upon the President.

The word to make the reductions
has not, however, been forthcoming.
And while from his message to Con-
gress recommending the bill and from
his campaign promises to reduce Fed-
eral expenditures the slashes in com-

pensations seem sure, the whole
road has not been traveled yet.
Whereas the various lobbies repre-

senting the veterans formerly heaped
their favors and threats upon the leg-
islators, they will now turn their
efforts toward the President himself.
It would be grossly unfair to a" man
who has acted with wisdom and cour-
age in a world calamity to suggest
that he would bow a.nd retrench on
such an important issue when the
necessary action is so clear. How-
ever, it should be noted that the
speciﬁc amounts of the reductions to
be made in veterans’ compensations
has not been deﬁnitely stated in the
bill passed by Congress. And whether
the cut from the Federal budget will
be large or small depends upon Mr.
Roosevelt. Here, clearly enough, po-
litical considerations will enter, And
here will be a test of Mr. Roosevelt's
courage and a test of the power of

— the American Legion and the Veter-

ans of Foreign Vvars.
Other Considerations

Vvhile the necessity for a balanced
budget is apparent enough to me, I
never found my temperature rising
when reading of the various rackets
and dodges which the existing system
of payments to veterans allowed.
Graft by a minority is certainly noth-
ing new in American or any other
variety of government. If war veter-
ans have been bleeding the Federal
treasury, they have only been follow-
ing the precedent set by corporations
and individuals who supplied the war
armies.

That, of course, is no economic
argument. And I would not suggest
that it be injected into a discussion of
what is to be done about budget bal-
ancing. But it is at least indicative
of the fact that veterans have been
no worse villains than any of the
other groups who pay lobbyists to
hand out favors and propaganda in

who are anxious at least to preserve appearances and an honest re-

spect for their Alma Mater.

Bonder, Goldberg Prepare

For
I ..

I ‘Abe Bonder, Col. '34, and Israel
Goldberg, Col. ’36, are to spend the
next week-end on the road when they
travel through the northeast, debat-
ing war-debts against Allegheny Col-
lege Thursday night and against Buf-
falo University Friday evening. Pro-
fessor W. M. Parrish, debating coach,
will accompany the boys on their
motor trip.

Bonder, who is social chairman of
the YMHA Student Council, is a sec-
ond-year man on the debate squad,
Goldberg, a freshman who is one of
the most active men on the squad, was
a. finalist in the extemporaneous
speaking contest of the National
Forensic League at Sioux City last
year. He has also been active on the
Pitt News and in Pitt Players.

While the boys are traveling, local
extension debates by the Men's De-
bating Association will be practically
at a standstill, with only one debate
scheduled in Pittsburgh during the
coming week.

On Thursday night, two teams of
Pitt men will argue war debts at the
Pittsburgh‘ Women's Business and
Professional Club. John Bracken,
Col. '34, and Leonard. Bo-reman, Col.
'33, will ad‘vocate cancellation against
Edwin Banks, Col. '35, and Saul
Shapira, Col. '34.

Bonder and Goldberg opposed Nor-
man Landy, Col. '34, and John Tor-
rence, Col. '34, in a preparation con-
test before the Twentieth Ward
League of Women Voters last night.
Tomorrow night, they debate Johnson
C. Smith College at the Center Ave-
nue YMCA.

German Club Elects New

Officers For Semester

 

 

The German Club, under the tem-
porary chairmanship of Clarissa
F‘-ricke, Ed. '34, met last Friday for
the ﬁrst time this semester.

The following oificers were elected:
president, Clarissa Fricke; vice pres-
ident, Alvin Pinter, Bus. Ad. '34; sec-
retary, Esther Crowley, Ed. '34; and
treasurer, Letitia Oster, Ed, ’35. Ten-
tative plans for the coming year were
discussed, and arrangements for a
more favorable time and place of
meeting were considered.

Following the meeting, a, program
relevant to the organization was pre-
sented. Clarissa Fricke delivered a
short talk on German clubs on the
Yale campus; German songs were
sung by the group; and William Pot-
ter, Ed..’33,‘ told German jokes and
stories. Refreshments were served.

Business Law Is Topic

Of Miles H. Jones Speech

Bankruptcy cases, business cases,
and the city manager plan of govern-
ment formed the nucleus of a talk by
Miles H. Jones, assistant professor
of business law, on “Law As Applied
to Business,” given before the metal-
lurgy seminar last Thursday at noon.

Howard Dunkle, metallurgy, ’33,
was chairman of this seminar. Homer
Dana, ’33, was selected chairman for
next week's meeting. Dana announced
that the speaker would be Prof. J. A.
Dent, head of the department of me-
chanical engineering.

The metallurgy social that will take
place Thursday March 30', during the
regular seminar hour was discussed.
Harry Joyce, '34, is chairman of this
event. The Ilunior class will furnish

entertainment for the rest of the de-
partment, and Joyce promises all a

“novel treat.”

the halls of the government buildings
in Washington. It was plain politi-
cal trickery and bullying that put
through the measures since the
‘Norld War which favored the veter-
ans. But who would suggest that the
:'3moot—Hawley tariff was passed
after being formulated by imp-artial
economists and considered by House,
Senate, and President with due prayer
and fasting?
Other Lobbies

The veterans’ organizations have
been doing what every other organi-
zation that could raise the necessary
money has done and is still doing.
Not only they have mimicked the
tactics of the workers in the holy
causes of the VVCTU, the Anti-saloon
League, and the numerous big busi-
ness lobbies. »

More to my dislike has been the
non-ﬁnancial aspect of the post-war
activities of the veterans. If there is
any excuse for an organized body of
men who have served in a modern
war, it is to work for peace. And yet
the American Legion and the Veter-
ans could hardly claim to have ex-
pended any great efforts in this direc-
tion.

Because they indulged in a useless,
bgloody conflict fourteen years ago, ex-
soldiers seem to believe that they en-
joy special privilegesand immunities.
While fully consciousof the dangers
that they submitted themselves to in
the World War, I hardly believe that
the privilege to defy law and human
decency attaches itself to such service.
If, for instance, ‘any organization

such riots as marked a convention of
the American Legion in Pittsburgh
last summer,.that organization would

be promptly tarred, feathered, and
run out of town.

other than war veterans were to stage .

House had passed a bill providing for the economies requested.
While the public press heralded the passage of this economy bill

as a. triumph over the undemocratic¢

World War measure up to the usual
standard of human beings, If on oc-

«casion they have- sought privileges ‘

with a ‘disregard for the general wel-
fare, they have followed a precedent
set by soldiers of other wars.

To come back to the matter of
Roosevelt's legislation: if the reduc-
tion of veterans’ compensations marks
the end of a political domination by
veterans, I for_one shall be glad.
There has been too much deference
shown for men who had nothing more
than badges to speak for a good rec-
ord. There has been too much awe
about the magic term, World War
Veteran. If any special ability to deal
with social problems goes with an
army career, I shall be glad to hear
of it. But in the meantime I shall
keep in mind the rotten, reactionary
years of the early twenties and the
aid which ex-soldiers were axious to
lend in the pogroms and persecutions
of those days.

WSGA Plans
Leaders Meet

Activities Committee Sets
April 20, 21 as Dates

 

Activities committee of WSGA is
formulating plans for for the Student
Leaders’ Institute which will take
place in the Soldiers’ and Sailors’
iVIemorial Hall, Thursday and Friday,
April~20 and 21.

The first day of the Institute will
be devoted to all those talks which
would interest the entire group pres-
ent, and the second day will feature
meetings for small groups. The prob-
lem of training both those who had
previous training from last year's in-
stitute and the training of the new
groups has been solved by arranging
primary and secondard types of edu-
cation for the second day of the pro-
gram.

Attendance will not be invitational
as it was last year, but permission to
attend may be received by personal
application. The hours this year will
also be shorter, lasting from 9:30 un-
til 3:3-0 o'clock on both days, rather
than until 5:30 o'clock as was done
last year.

Innovations are being made in the
program. The ability to follow will
be stressed as well as leadership,
since, in the past, women who were
not elected to oﬁices for which they
were nominated have generally lost
interest in activities. The problem of
the lack of responsibility shown by
committee members who have left the
burden of the work to committee
chairmen will also be dealt with.

Tentative plans are being made to
open the Institute on Thursday morn-
ing with the induction of officers to
all major campus organizations. For-.
merly, this induction ceremony has
been a separate affair held in late
spring. By the method being discuss-
ed, no organization would lose the ‘in-
dividuality of its own induction cere-
inony, but each would have its indi-
vﬁdual part.

Ruth Bowser, Ed. '34, chairman of
activities committee, is in charge of
the institute, assisted by Ethel Sil-
verblatt, Col. '34, sub-chairman. The
remainder of the committee is com-

prised of: Orpha Leiglity, Col. '35;
Mary Blackburn, Col. ’33; Eleanor
Brankstone, Bus. Ad. '34; Thelma

Yetter, Ed. ’33; Margaret Klein, Ed.
’33; Muriel McGee, Col. '35; Esther
Simons, Ed. '35, and Sally Sanderson,
Col. '35.

The Institute was originally plan-
ned for April 6 and 7, but since it
was considered wiser to wait until
ofﬁcers were elected the date was
changed to April 20 and 21.

Pitt Riﬂles
To Get Keys

ROTC Honorary Emblems
Designed by McFarland

With the decision of the Pitt Riﬂes,
honorary military drill platoon, to
adopt the emblem designed by Ken
McFarland, Col. ’35, as its official
insignia, another key is soon to ap-
pear on the- campus.

The group is entirely under the di-
rection of the military department
and hence, the sanction of the Stu-
dent Council is unnecessary to allow
the keys to be used. The key, as
designed by McFarland, consists -of a
sheld over crossed cannon, symbolic

of the coast artillery corps. A saber
down the middle of the key is made
to represent the saber of the cadet
oﬁicer and all that his position sym-
bolizes. A panther is grasping the
shield and engraved on the shield
are the initials P. R.

Deﬁnite, rigid requirements are be-
ing made so that the gaining of the
key will be no common occurrence.
Mere membership in the Riﬂes will
entitle the man to wear the blue and
gold fouragerre, but to obtain a key
-a number of Years of service for the
unit will be necessary although the
exact num.ber is not yet deﬁnite.

There’s just one thing to do—and
high time somebody did "it. Intro-
duce Bill Boner to a good pipe and
good tobacco. A pipe helps a man
get down to straight thinking. Col-
lege men know, too, that there’s one
smoking tobacco without a rival.
That's Edgeworth.*

Here’s an idea. Fill your pipe
with Edgeworth Smoking Tobacco
and light up. Now—.take a good long
puff. Ever try anything like that
before? Of course not, for Edge-
worth is a distinctive and dllﬁefeltt
blend of ﬁne old burleys.

Buy Edgeworth anywhere in two

dor tin. If you'd like to try before
you buy, write for a free sample

bacco at 42 out of 51
