Volume three, number two,
of the Question Mark, ‘official
dope sheet of women students,
and political guide, made its,
appearance in Alumni Hall
Wednesday, in the shadow of .
the three ballot boxes. The
sheet was clothed in pale pink,
to analogize the henna haired
editors,’ Duella; S. Stranahan,
Ed. ’29, and Florence Luman,
Col. ’31. '

Reports clue us with ‘the idea
that male representation was
also apparent.» in the publica-
tion. A young lady, Katrinka
Fern Kenny, who is not regis-
tered in the oﬂice of vital sta-
tistics, contributed an editorial
cartoon. _ ’ ’ , .

r.W;c.A. WORKER TALKS
ABOUT SEX VULGARITY

“Commercialism of sex‘ knowl-
edge is prevalent today-because the
church and school have denied it
to us,” Aulene Marley Jameson, M.
D., Pitt "alumina and Y. W. -C. A.

worker,’ said in the opening talk of 9

a series; at Heinz House. Monday
on “We, Men and Women.” The
discussions will continue at the
regular -‘Monday "noon . meetings
throughout the‘ month of April.
Dr. Jameson traced the origin of
sex vulgarity ﬁrst through the Epi-
curean, then. the Stoic, and then
the church fathers who went to
the opposite. extreme, from the Epi-
cureans,.and Stoics and put a taboo
on sex.‘ Commercialism was the

natural result of this restriction by

the church. Modern sex‘ magazines
aiid motion pictures are ”the sub-
stitute for correct knowledge under
our present system. ' S

The. remedy, Dr. Jameson points’

out, is knowledge, not -just, half
knowledge of «sex for everyone.

C Akron On Evolution

Dr. Roswell Johnson, head of the
‘oil a-nd'gas department, this morn-
ing addressed the- student assembly
at'th_e University of Akron on the
"‘Control.of Human Evolution.” The
theme, question “Is it possible to se-
‘cure for new born babies [of the
-future an innate moral,"mental and
physicalnature superior to that of»
the present generation,” was an-
swered‘, in-the course ofthe lecture‘...

vTo amplify. the topic he divided
it.in’co' three parts, natural, artiﬁcial
an-d sexual selection, Dr. Johnson

‘relieves that eugenics is a primary

, “spect of the control of human evo-

ition. “The immediate mission of

‘eugenics becomes advocacy of all

measures tending to race improve-
ment.” he states. He believes that
selection, though a dominating fac-
tor,-is not the sole one in evolution,
determinate‘ variation and direct in-~
ﬂuence of environment being also of
great importance. '

Received the following communi-
cation in my mail the other day:
" Tothe Campus Scout: A
In your column recently you
ventured the opinion that every
physically fit fellow should go
out for spring training. Did it
ever occur to you that in the
spring a young man's fancy
turns to thoughts of baseball?
. Why doesn’t Pitt" have a base-
ball « team? The “tommercial
theory” can’t have anything to
do with it, do you think; or was
the stadium built in order to
give us a good biisketball-ﬂoor?
Pitt is the only big» university
'that.doesn’t have varsity, base-
ball." We’ don’t even-have intra-
mural baseball.’ If the purpose
of college athletics. is to furnish
physical‘ exercise ti)’ the stu-
dents, why not sponsor, some-
thing that more than seventy-'
ﬁve fellowscan enjoy and bene-
ﬁ_t_ ‘from? The sports depart-'
ment-' of The Weekly has‘ a ﬁne
chance to get closervto thegen-
eral student body. if they would
organizer a baseball league be-
,tween classes, .or A better still,-
" .._between‘.the schools. A six team
loop‘ _could. easily be» arranged; —
and no doubt t1'u.iAte' a few of the
remaining twenty-nines hundred
’ Pitt fellows,'who~ aren’t' at pres-
ent Ain-terested in some form of
Pitt‘ athletics, would try for the
teams. ‘ ’ .
-I. hope this suggestion re-
ceives some consideration.

All of which your scout thinks is
mighty ﬁne, especially coming from

a 'fresliman. :A baseball league is.

just the tliiiigAneededgat Pitt. As far
as a varsity is concernedit has been
proved "conclusively that spring and
summer varsityybaseball team can-

not be put "on even a half paying

basis and few s-peetators.are inter-
ested}. _When Lefty Hill, Harding,
Swetonic and other boys‘ prominent
in Pitt baseball graduated quite a few
years ago, baseballhiterest declined
and now the Pittsburgh Pirates have
moiiopolized the baseball in.terest of
this district.
. ‘-" -——o—— .
As to .intramural baseball,
yourscout feels that there is
an urgent ’demand for some
sport among the students on the
campus and The ‘Pitt Weekly
will get behind any movement
that is started to inaugurate
such a program. But the logical.
place forithis to start is ,e-itlier
