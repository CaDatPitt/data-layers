Pitt police
no longer

Staff Writer

University of Pittsburgh Police
may no longer be ticketing ille-
gally parked cars in Oakland
parking lots.

Faculty Assembly President
James Holland reported to
assembly members yesterday
that other people will be hired
specifically to circulate parking
lots and issue parking tickets.

Holland said this would free
Pitt police officers, giving them
more time to patrol the streets of
Oakland.

The only disturbing part of the
proposal centers around the
money issue involved in hiring
more people, Holland said. But
the Department ' of
Transportation said that this
money would be generated
through parking tickets and car
ﬁnes. ’ ' i

In another proposed policy,
people who have overdue car
fines or fees will have those costs
deducted from their pay. _

“The tone of this [proposal] is
not a tone that should be applied

As the late afternoon sun set
behind the Pittsburgh city sky-

A line, the masses moved into the

gates of Three Rivers Stadium
for the Pittsburgh Pirates’ 1993

‘opening day contest against

San Diego’s Padres.

The evening’s competition
symbolized a turning point in
Pittsburgh Pirates baseball.
What has become the epitome
of a small market franchise, the
Bucs were raped and plun-
dered in the offseason, losing
their two most valuable free
agents, and were forced to field
what amounts to virtually a
Triple-A team.

Regardless of the monetary
crunch felt in the front offices,
fans that piled into the orange
seats of the stadium were opti-
mistic and happy to see base-
ball back in the ‘Burgh.

“They’re gonna kick the San
Diego ass,” optimistic Pirate, fan
Mayank Patel said. “I hope this
year they're going to win --
that’s my only wish.”

“I think it’s going to be good
— the season’s going to be
wide open,” said Kate Colligan,
another avid Pirate fan.

The pageantry of Opening
Day even brought out the
social whirlwind that is the Pitt
cheedeaden

“It’s good to see the new sea-
son begin,” cheerleader Leslie
Davey said. “We brought our
binoculars to check out the
players and see_ if their creden-
tials are good.”

Despite the beautiful weather
and the celebration of the day,
several fans had fiscal responsi-
bility in mind as they handed
their tickets to stadium ushers.

“I don’t have nothing to say
about them a—holes,” was the
terse reply of a nameless spec-
tator who munched on a hot
dog and sipped on- an Iron City
outside of Gate C.

“Economics determines a lot
of things and you got to do
what you got to do,” said Brad
Karrol, a graduate student from
Moon Township. “You can’t
keep high-priced players
around. I’m not going to say
‘You should keep these players
even though you can’t afford
them.’ It’s better to have a team
without talent than no team at
all.”

“I like the young team, but I
don’t like the fact that they lost

Panther Hollow Pond is sight of
dumping for nearby construction

By John Temple
Asst. News Editor

Oakland residents and business people
are asking the city to help spruce up the
area around Panther Hollow Pond.

The Oakland Business and Civic
Association sent a letter to Mayor Sophie
Masloff last November, complaining of
“deplorable conditions” in and around the
pond and blaming the city for part of the
problem.

The association said that a public works
division near the pond has a salt pile -that
leaches into the pond and has dumped
concrete nearby.

The salt, which is distributed on icy city
streets in winter, drains toward the
already polluted pond, according to Sol
Gross, owner of Panther Hollow Parking
and member of the association.

Assistant Director of Park Maintenance
Jeffery Horan admitted that part of the
problem is due to the public works divi-
sion, but says that they must implement a
long—term solution —— i.e. moving the divi-
sion.

“We need to find a new property big
enough and secluded enough to relocate
the division,” Horan said. “We want to
build a salt dome and storage for brick,
concrete and stone.”

Finding a new location for the salt is
especially troublesome, according to

Horan. The pile must be within a handy
distance of Oakland’s hospitals and busi-
ness district.

“It’s imperative that people can reach
the hospitals quickly,” Horan said.

The City Planning Department is study-
ing the area to find a new location for the
division, Horan said.

He said that park maintenance cleaned
up garbage floating on the pond as the
association asked, but said that a full-
scale dredging and cleaning is “part of the
longer range plans for the area.”

“The litter in the pond does not come
from the Fourth Division,” Horan said.
“The majority of it comes from passersby
and children. We clean up the litter as a
normal process.”

As to allegations that the division was
dumping concrete near the pond, Horan
said that no such dumping has occurred
recently.

“There is still some debris, but there is
growth over it,” he said. “At this point, the
hillside removal of concrete is part of our
longer range plans.”

Horan referred to a volunteer program,
Partners in Parks, to clean the city’s parks.
But Gross said the program is not taking
advantage of people concerned about
their parks.

“I wanted to join the program and sent
them a letter about two months ago,” he
said. “I’m still waiting for a reply.”

 

Faderman ml/es about
role of lesbians in military

By Thanita Adams
Staff‘ Writer

Award-winning author Lillian Faderman spoke to an enthusias-
tic audience in the William Pitt Union this past Saturday about the
part lesbians have played in the military.

The title of the lecture, “Naked Amazons and Queer Damsels: A
History of Lesbians in the Military,” was based on a comment
made in 1942 by a critic of the policy of allowing women to serve
in the armed forces.

According to Fadennan, this man said that the only women who
would want to join would be “naked amazons and queer damsels
from the isle of lesbos.”

Faderman, a professor at California State University in Fresno, is

the author of Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian

Life in Twentieth-Century America, which she said is an “analysis
about the formation and vitality of lesbians in the community.”

The book has been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and National
Book Award. Odd Girls appears to have been well-received by
critics and fans alike, including Pitt law student Marian Kent who
was looking forward to Faderman’s speech.

“I read the book and I think [Faderman] is wonderful, but I’ve
never heard her speak before,” Kent said.

Faderman opened her talk by pointing out that news concern-
ing the anti—gay ban in the military has largely ignored lesbians
and has focused primarily on gay men. A

After mentioning some pictures that supporters of the ban have

year. After starting out with 4 sweatshirts in a box, and putting that box into the trunk of mycar, The Pittsburgh Stop, Inc.
now has the largest selection of Pitt items in the world. After visiting many college bookstores around the country and
comparing prices to our famous $9 -100% pre-shrunk heavyweight t-shirts and our 3329- 12 oz. Lee Cross Grain
heavyweight sweatshirts, our prices are not only the best in Oakland, but also around the country. Our everyday low prices
are lower than our local competitors 20% off prices. 1

But what makes this year special is that the class of ‘93 has grown with us. I remember freshman orientation in ‘89,
passing out ﬂiers with the class of ‘93 on them and freshman asking me where the library was and seeing students go to the
wrong building for class, as well as learning to adjust to college life and earning money to pay those large phone bills! Now,
4 years later with lots of hard work and dedication, the class of ‘93 will" become the future of our country. Congratulations!

As this class graduates to become leaders of our country, The Pittsburgh Stop, Inc. has graduated from vendor to the only
licensed manufacturer of Pitt paraphernalia on campus.

I am glad to announce that on Feb. 5th, 1993,The Pittsburgh Stop, Inc., along with Shirts Illustrated, Inc., which is owned
and operated by The Pittsburgh Stop, Inc. signed an agreement with the University of Pittsburgh and Collegiate Licensing
_Co. This enables Shirts Illustrated, Inc. to be a licensed manufacturer of Pitt paraphernalia. This agreement entitles us to put
the Pitt trademarks on'all marketable items. We have two professional artists on duty to assure the best artwork and to
upgrade designs annually. The most important aspect is price! As a manufacturer, we can bulk-buy all goods, print and then
sell. This eliminates other printers and saleman’s commissions, guaranteeing the best possible price for years and years to
come. .

How more official can you get? A Pittsburgh native, University of Pittsburgh Alumni, Golden Panther, manufacturing Pitt
products in Pittsburgh, and selling them under the shadow of the Cathedral of Learning. Exciting!

To all University students, departments, staff, greek organizations and businesses —— we silk screen for all occasions. Our
service is excellent and we deliver —— just call 621-7488 for more info.

A special thanks to Chancellor O’Connor, Sr.Vice Chancellor Tucci, Asst.Vice—Chance1lor DeVitto and Athletic Director
Oval Jaynes for having the honesty and open-minded willingness for resolving past issues and differences and making this
agreement possible. Hail to Pitt!

Last but not least, we would like to thank everyone who supported us the past 4 years, especially the class of ‘93 of whom
many friendships have been made. The bottom line for the class of ‘93 and The Pittsburgh Stop Inc. is perseverance in that

Literacy brings Generations T ogetber

Byjudith A. Friedl
Staff Writer

Generations Together is looking for adults
over 50 to take part in an intergenerational
family literacy project.

The group, a department of the University of
Pittsburgh’s Center for Social and Urban
Research, is working with Beaver County Head
Start and the county’s Adult Literacy Action
program to help Beaver County families gear
their children toward a successful start in
school. '

Eligible adults must be interested in promot-
ing literacy in young families in Beaver County.
They will complete a 20-hour training course
and attend supportive in—service training and
planning sessions. As mentors, they must com-
mit to a nine—month involvement with the pro-
ject. Mentors will work with three families for
one hour each week and receive a $3 per hour
stipend.

Training has just started at two sites in

Beaver County.

Cheryl Mack, co—director of the
Intergenerational Early Childhood Program,
said that other literacy professionals are excited
by the program’s ideas.

“We’ve been invited to present this program
at two conferences coming out of the Literacy
Network,” she said.

The network is made up of people involved
in the literacy field.

“Our program is unique in the intergenera—
tional connection.” Mack said. “We are utilizing
skills and experiences of older adults. That’s
what makes it different.”

Intergenerational Family Literacy, one of
Generations T ogether’s early children pro
grams, is a Head Start/Older Adult Partnership
that uses trained older adults to increase par-
ents’ literacy skills and, through the parents,
chi1dren’s literacy skills as well.

The program will establish supportive rela-
tionships between seasoned adults and young
parents.

Glee Club and Women's
Choral Ensemble join

in springtime concert
By Judith A. Friedl
Staﬁ’ Writer

Frick Fine Arts Auditorium resounded with the voices of the
Pitt Men’s Glee Club and the Women’s Choral Ensemble as they
joined together in song Sunday afternoon.

They sang “By the Waters of Babylon,” a work for divided
choirs. The singers, split between the stage and the back of the
auditorium, gave the piece a strong, call-and—response style that
emphasized its homesick lament.

The ensemble was a guest for the first half of the Glee Club’s
annual spring concert. Other combined works —— a psalm in
Hebrew, a madrigal by Purcell and two hymns by J. S. Bach,
were more traditionally arranged to highlight both men’s and
women’s choirs.

The men were guests at the women’s annual concert the
evening before.

The choirs have been participating in each other’s spring con-
certs on and off for “about four or five years now,” said Gary
Baczewski, the club’s social chairperson.

“Doing four-part harmony with women is refreshing,” added
Richard Koval, alumni liaison and graduating senior.

During a short intermission both choirs left the stage, and the
Glee Club opened the second half by coming down the aisles
from the back of the auditorium, singing “Open a New
Window” by Jerry Herman. S

Lively songs on love and drinking included “Vive L’Amour;”
the rousing medieval-style drinking song “Un Taberna Quando
Sumus” from Carmina Burana by Carl Orff; and the politically
incorrect but fun “Standing On the Corner (Watching All the
Girls Go By).” '

The Men’s Glee Club is the oldest extracurricular activity at
Pitt. Founded in 1890, it includes men from all the schools of
the university. Over the years, the Glee Club has sung at Pitt
basketball and football games, at Three Rivers Stadium and at
the Civic Arena.

Glee Club President Don Young said the group will go on a
tour of New England for two weeks in the beginning of May.

Panther
Batallion
goes Army

By Pete Kapustynski

Asst. News Editor

As the Panther ROTC
Battalion went to the
woods of Burgettstown
for a field training exer-
cise this weekend, it
had much to be proud
of.

“VY/e’re killing every-
body else in the state!”
said Professor of
Military Science Lt.
Colonel Michael H.
Cassetori, director of
Pitt’s ROTC Program.

“\Y/e’re just sitting here
and the awards just
keep coming in,”
Cassetori said.

Pitt and Carnegie
Mellon) had more senior
cadets chosen for mili-
tary service than any

Continued from page 3
painted, such as hapless sol-
diers being attacked in the
showers by their gay counter-
parts, she amused the audience
by asking, “What, don’t les-
bians take showers, too?”

Faderman quickly built a
strong rapport with the audi-
ence as she spoke about les-
bians’ participation in the
armed forces, which has been
documented as early as the
Revolutionary War.

She compared the military to
women’s colleges of the 19th
century, calling it the “poor
woman’s Vassar or Bryn
Mawr,” as it was a place where
many young women who were
uncertain of their identity met
and fell in love.

Faderman assented that there
is a large proportion of les-
bians in the military. According

to her findings, 1 percent of
heterosexual women have
served in the military, whereas
6 percent of the lesbian popu-
lation has served.

She said that the military
attracted lesbians because it
allowed them to “express com-
petency and physical prowess
 For the first time, women
saw other females as compe-
tent beings.”

“Lesbians have a long history
of contributing greatly to their
country [through military ser-
vice] and being thanked for
their contributions,” Faderman
said.

Throughout her speech,
Faderman pointed out that
despite the introduction of a
ban against homosexuals in the
military in 1942 “lesbians have
had an almost protected status
in the military during wars.”

She said that recruiters were
ordered to investigate a
woman’s background at the
end of 1942. However, this
practice was soon abandoned
as recruiters found that they
could no longer fill their quo-
I218.

Faderman found that,
although there have been
between-war periods when
lesbians in the services have
been persecuted, they were for
the most part left alone. As one
Woman Faderman interviewed
who had served in the Vietnam
War said, “The army didn’t
want to make life too hard on

us. We were too valuable.”

Faderman ended her talk
with a question and answer
session during which a
younger woman expressed
pessimism over positive
changes in attitudes toward
homosexuals ever taking place.

After pausing for a mo-
ment, Faderman replied,
“I came out as a lesbian in
1956  those years were hell.
I’m amazed at what is
happening now, there has
been tremendous progress.
Even my being here
would be unimaginable 15
years ago.”

STUDENT AFFAIRS
Office of the Vice Chancellor

Dear University Community:

For most of us in Western Pennsylvania three meals a day are assured. For approximately 200,000 of our neighbors,
however, it is a luxury that doesn’t always happen. To help address this problem the University will again participate in the
Scouting for Food campaign, a food collection drive sponsored by the Allegheny Trails Council of the Boy Scouts of America.

You can help with this vital project by bringing nonperishable food and grocery items to the University from April 13 to
15, and putting them in the hampers and boxes placed at strategic locations in most University buildings. While any canned
food in good condition is welcome, there are several types of foods which are preferred because of their nutritional value:
peanut butter (in plastic containers), chunky-type soups, tuna, stews, meats, baby formula or any complete packaged meal.
Home cleaning products, paper towels, and diapers also are needed. ‘

Once collected the food items will be provided to the area’s 450 food pantries and kitchens for distribution to needy
individuals. A growing concern is the large number of single mothers and frail elderly who are turning to the food kitchens
and pantries for assistance. Today, nearly 60% of the food collected goes to help women and children.

Remember to review your surplus food in the pantry at home, and feel free to stock up on specials at your grocery store.
All of your contributions will address critical community needs. Bring what you “can" between April 13- 15.

Sincerely,

William W. Harmon
Vice Chancellor

Pittsburgh and crime

We don’t usually make it a habit to criticize the opinion of

our colleagues. After all, like us they are equally entitled to V

express their First Amendment rights. Nevertheless, Tuesday’s
op—ed page of the Post-Gazette printed one of the more ludi-
crous editorials in recent history.

It seems that City Councilman Gene Ricciardi has intro-
duced a proposal that would pay police officers to reside in
the neighborhoods that need them the most. The proposal
calls for the city to subsidize the policemen and policewomen
to live where crime is rampant. Policemen, it is then assumed,
will be ableto answer calls and respond rapidly. The Post-
Gazette said that “everyone may be surprised by the results.”

Well, not everybody likes surprises. Everyone does, howev-
er, like results.

It is true that Oakland, hardly one of Pittsburgh’s most up-
and-coming neighborhoods, has seen crime increase while at
the same time the police force has decreased. A few more
police officers in Oakland would no doubt make it a little
safer. I .

Even so, there still is no concrete evidence thatmore police
means less crime and vice versa. On the contrary, by the time
a city usually decides to hire more police officers the problem
has already manifested itself into a quagmire of death, drugs
and gangs. More police officers is a symptom of the problem,
not the solution.

Having lost several Fortune 500 companies, the more telling
figure is that during the past 10 years the city of Pittsburgh
has slipped from number three to eight among major industri-
al cities. If Pittsburgh continues to lose its manufacturing
base, regardless of how many police officers the city hires,
crime will increase. Plain and simple.

If City Council, state and federal representatives want to
make a difference in the fight against crime, their focus
should be on attracting businesses and jobs — not hiring
more police. Jack Kemp has suggested enterprise zones. Bill
Clinton suggested investment credits. George Bush talked of
cuts in the capital gains tax. All are valid suggestions.
Moreover, you probably wouldn't be surprised by the results.

A smart suggestion

University of Pittsburgh police officers will now hopefully
be able to get away from the meticulous downfalls associated
with their job and do what they do best. And we’re not talk-
ing about eating donuts either.

Yesterday at the Faculty Assembly meeting, President James
G. Holland offered the suggestion that Pitt should hire indi-
viduals specifically for the job of circulating parking lots and
issuing tickets. It seems like a logical suggestion. Let’s hope
the administration institutes the proposal quickly.

As with anything, the question of cost comes into play. The
university is already pressed for funds and any little project
will strangle the’ administration even further. Why couldn’t
the university hire students to do the dirty work?

The university would not have to create another bureaucra-
cy to handle the parking tickets because students would be
able to report to the policeat the end_of their shifts. And they
could benefit from added job opportunities on campus.

We estimate that the necessary staff to circulate parking lots
would have to be no more than 15 people during the regular

‘ work week.

That would cost the university around $2,600 a week —
money which is sure to be offset by the number of tickets
generated through parking tickets and car fines.

A new solution and a new problem

SoutbAfrz'ccm politics need newform of segregation

Segregation. It has been syn-
onymous with racism and
hatred and conjures up memo-
ries from the Civil Rights
Movement. But 75 years ago,
the idea of segregation also had
another meaning: self-determi-
nation. After World War 1, self-
determination was considered
the best way to promote free-
dom and democracy. No longer
would the Great Powers carve
up the lands of Europe’s ethnic
groups in the name of preserv-
ing the “Balance of Power.” The
people of Europe would be
allowed to decide their own fate
and govern themselves. Today,
with ethnic violence breaking
out around the world, we are
left with a question: is segrega-
tion really so bad?

While the Western media has
focused on the conflict raging in
Bosnia, they have virtually over-
looked the real extent of the
problem. Ethnic strife exists all
over the world, from Bosnia to
Cambodia to the former Soviet
Union, and there seems to be
little chance of improvement
any time soon. A case in point is
South Africa.

Since the end of apartheid,
the situation in South Africa has
become more and more chaotic.
The African National Congress
(ANC) has had repeated clashes
with the Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) over the nation's post-
apartheid distribution of power.
In the area of Natal, a bloody
civil war between the ANC
(controlling the south) and the
IFP (controlling the north) has
resulted in over 9,000 deaths
since 1990. The central reasons
for this conflict and others in
South Africa are best under-
stood in terms of self-determi-
nation.

The main political goal of the
ANC is the uniﬁcation of South
Africa under black majority rule.
Currently, much of South Africa
is broken into ethnic regions, or
homelands, where numerous
blacks were forced to live dur-

ing apartheid. While these areas
have some powers of self-rule,
the ANC wishes to reintegrate
them under one central govern-
ment. Since the ANC is the most
powerful black group in South
African politics, it would domi-
nate such a political structure.
For this reason, the IFP (a
Zulu Nationalist group) wants a
much less centralized govern-
ment in order to limit ANC
power. The IFP is joined in this

Mike

interest by_ many other black
regional leaders, as well as
many right-wing white groups

anxious to retain some sem-

blance of influence in South
Africa’s future.

While all of these groups have
an interest in preserving the
power they currently hold, poli-
tics is only one facet of the
problem. Ethnic conflict may
prove far more dangerous.

There are 10 homelands in
South Africa, four of which are
independent and six of which
are not. These homelands are
centered around various tribes,
many of whom have significant
animosity toward each other. If
South Africa remains united, it
runs the risk of serious ethnic
conﬂicts.

With no oppressor to unite
them, the tribes may find them-
selves at each others throats and
even the ANC may not be able
to survive the ethnic clashes.
One solution that has been sug-
gested by the IFP and other
regional leaders has been to
create a confederation where
the various tribal groups would
be able to exercise a great deal
of independence. In other
words, they want self-determi-
nation. I

But should South Africa’s eth-
nic groups be allowed to go
their separate ways with little, if
any, central government to

unite them? This has its own
problems. First of all, since the
economic strength of South
Africa has been centered on the
white population, the tribal
homelands would be among the
poorest “nations” of the world.
Even a severe redistribution of
South Africa’s wealth would fail
to redress the inequalities. Also,
only the white areas of South
Africa have the infrastructure
necessary to provide an ade-
quate quality of life. The result
may be political freedom but it
would also mean economic
devastation for blacks in South
Africa. In addition, such separa-
tion along racial and ethnic
lines conjures up images of eth-
nic cleansing and continues the
ugly history of apartheid.

Segregation, ethnic cleansing
and apartheid. The darker side
of self-determination seems
clear. But trying to keep a
nation of hostile ethnicities
together may prove to be equal-
ly bleak. '

If such unification is pushed
too hard, the result is likely to
be even more bloodshed. That
would provide us with a grim
lesson. Whether it is South
Africa or Bosnia, Cambodia or
the former Soviet Union, the
results of continued ethnic con-'
flict are the same: violence,
chaos and death.

In the end, this sad group of
nations must find a cure for
their common malady. A com-
promise will have to be
reached. The question is, how
many people will die before
that happens?

For now, it seems that self-
determination and ethnic segre-
gation may be the only way to
have both peace and political
freedom.

It may be an imperfect solu-
tion, but in an imperfect world
that may be the best we can
hope for.

Pitt adds
Aggelou
before
Classic

By Ryan Buncher
Sports Editor

The 1993 Asics Annual
Roundball Classic will
once again give
Pittsburgh fans a chance
to see a player headed
for the Panther basket-
ball program.

Last year, Garrick
Thomas made an imme-
diate impression, win-
ning the slam dunk com-

petition before the
game.

This year’s future
Panther is Sotiris

Aggelou, a guard from
Riverside High School in
Ellwood City known for
his outside shooting,
who has signed with
Pitt.

Aggelou was already
scheduled to be a mem-
ber of the Pennsylvania
All-Star team in its game
against The USA All-
Stars at the Civic Arena
Thursday night.

The event will also
include a three—point
shootout, slam dunk
contest and scrimmages
tonight at Fitzgerald
Field House.

a pou Pres in opener

By Stephen Liss

’ Staﬁ" Writer

Baseball is supposed to be a
game of lulls coupled with brief
spurts of excitement. But it’s a little
ridiculous when it takes three
hours and 50 minutes in a brisk
wind under dull grey skies to
complete an eight-and-a-half
inning ball game.

That’s how long it took for the
Pitt Panthers (18-3) yesterday
afternoon/evening when they
clawed their way from behind to
knock off St. Bonaventure 9-7 at
Trees Field.

The Bonnies (5-11) were in
complete control of the game for
five innings. Left handed pitcher
Mark Culley scattered 11 hits and
six walks allowing two runs
through the first six, while St.
Bonaventure’s offense battered
Panther pitcher Mark Culley for
seven runs, five of them earned.

But the momentum slowly shift-
ed in the top of the sixth. Pitt’s
relievers David Kelley and Matt
Skokowski kept St. Bonaventure
scoreless while the Panther bats
began to chip away at the lead.

Jason Roth’s ground out in the
bottom of the sixth scored Craig
Crawley from third, cutting the
deficit to 7-4. Then in the seventh,

Baseball programs were just one of the things returning to the ball park last night.

By Ryan Buncher
Sports Editor

This is going to be a
bumpy ride, but for now it is
time for optimism. ’

The Pittsburgh Pirates
opened their 1993 season last
night with a 9-4 drubbing of
the Padres at Three Rivers
Stadium. Despite the margin
of victory, they did not make
it look easy.

One player the Bucs are

counting on, pitcher Tim
Wakefield, gave up only one
run in seven plus innings and
got the victory. The second-
year knuckleballer struck out
nine but dished out nine free
passes. After the game,
Wakefield said he was not
thrilled with the effort.
“When [the knuckleball is]
on, it’s going to be great,”
Wakefield said. “When it’s
off, it’s going to be ugly.
That’s what you saw

tonight.”

Wakefield walked four in
the sixth inning, including
walking in the only run he
gave up in the contest.

“I don’t think they were as
frustrated [getting only one
run on four walks] as I was
giving up all those walks,”
Wakefield said.

The Pirates had broken the
game open in the fifth. Kevin
Young’s bases-loaded double

comes back to beat Bonnies

shortstop Danny Gonzalez milked
a bases-loaded walk from Culley
to slice St. Bonaventure’s lead to
two. Gonzalez finished the game
three for four with two RBIs. Pitt
trailed by one when Josh T yler’s
fielder’s choice scored Kurt
Womelsdorf from third.

“I wasn’t real concerned about
trailing by five runs mid-way
through the game,” Pitt head
coach Mark Jackson said. “We’ve
come back from bigger deficits
this year so I wasn’t wonied at all.”

In the bottom of the eighth, St.
Bonaventure’s defense fell apart,
helping the Panthers cap their
comeback. Bonnie reliever
William Ham's’ wild pitch allowed
Kurt Allen to cross the plate and
tie the game at seven.

Two walks and an error by
shortstop Bill Paladino loaded the
bases for Crawley. He smashed
the first pitch up the middle for a
two-run hit, giving Pitt its first lead
since the team held a 1-0 advan-
tage in the second. —

“He [Harris] was throwing first-
pitch fastballs to everyone,”
Crawley said, explaining his
game-winning hit. “I went up
there looking for a first—pitch fast-
ball and that‘s what I got.

Why is the National League
West the best division in
baseball? Two words:
Pittsburgh Pirates.

Thanks to the financial
misfortunes — or realities, as
Ted Simmons would say —
of the thrice—defending NL
East champs, the West now
houses three star players
likely to impact the 1995
division race: Barry Bonds,
Doug Drabek and john
Smiley.

With Bonds headed to
Frisco, Drabek home to
Houston and Smiley back in
the Queen City, the West is
certainly the best division in
the majors —— propping as
many as four teams that
would be favorites to claim
top prize in their brother
division, the lovvly NL East:
the Reds, Giants, Astros and,
of course, the always—men-
tioned Braves of Atlanta.

But as some things change
and improve, some things
stay the same. Like the

Atlanta Braves owning the

division.

While the Reds, Giants and
Astros would likely have
their way with the least of
the East, they’ll be fixin’ for
little more than bridesmaid.
Why? Simple. The best pitch-
ing in baseball combined
with a four—way offensive
nightmare called Sanders-
Gant—Nixon-Justice.

With a stable of young
guns both on the mound and
in the field, Atlanta’s almost-
champ Braves were already
the most talented team in the
league. Then they got the
best pitcher in the league —
Greg “268 innings” Maddux.

Quick—starting staff roll
call: Maddux, Tom Glavine,
John Smoltz, Steve Avery and

- Pete Smith.

Translation:
three-peat.

her of the oft-abused
Lightning, he was knocked in
the head in a previous game
and suffered a severe concus-
sion. When the news came
down he was still a little
dazed, but happy.

“When they told me I was
traded I was jumping for joy, I
guess you could call it,” he
said. “My wife and family
stayed here and it was an ulti-
mate thing to come back to a
team like this. I was probably
more excited than you could
possibly imagine.”

Taglianetti led his former
club with a plus-six, an
impressive total for a
Lightning.

“I was happy to go down
there and play because I got
to play a lot and do a lot of
different things. They relied
on me for a lot of situations.”

Earlier in the season the
assistant captain played
against his former mates — a
nerve-wracking experience
for the two-time Stanley Cup
winner.

“I was very nervous,” he
said. “You want to show the
team you left that you can still
play and that they made a
mistake letting you go. It all
goes in the back of your
mind, but I was nervous. It
was nice seeing all of the guys
and playing against them, but
it is always tough to play
against one of your old
teams.”

His new role for his old
team will be a much more
limited one than in Tampa.
He will not be on the number-
one defensive line, and he
probably won’t be on the
number two. What he will
provide is the solid, stay-at-
home defenseman that the
Pens have always lacked and
are now beginning to stock-
pile.
“I’m just hoping that I can
give this team some steady
defensive play,” Taglianetti
said. “We play physical and
keep the puck out of our net,
and that’s all you can ask. You
don’t win anything unless you

that we know that we’re good.
Things weren’t going our way at
first, we were hitting their pitch-
ing, but the runs weren’t coming
in until the end”

In the top of the ninth, the
Bonnies didn’t let up. With run-
ners on first and second and
nobody out, the side-arrn pitching
Skokowski finished off the
Bonnies.

Power hitter Mike Simmons
struck out swinging. The next bat-
ter, Lou Russell, snubbed a
grounder back to the mound,
advancing the runners. With the
tying run on second, Skokowski
blew a fastball by catcher Chris
Kurek to end the game.

“I rarely strike out hitters,” an
elated Skokowski confessed after
the game. “I’m a groundball pitch-
er that got lucky, but it was nice to
end it that way.

“My curveball was ﬂat, my fast-
ball wasn’t tailing as ‘much as I’d
like it to, so I had to concentrate
on hitting my spots.”

Skokowski (2-0), a first—year
player, was credited with the win

and striking out three batters in

Padre starter Andy Benes.
Benes gave up five runs on

The Pirates capped off the

single by Wakefield.

The Padres pulled within

but the Bucs stretched the
lead back to five with three
runs in the bottom of the
inning as Andy Van Slyke
and Young chipped in RBI
singles and Jeff King scored
on an error by Padre out-

oft forgotten: the best of the
West has yet to win a World
Championship.

Like fellow runnersup in
the entertainment world
(a.k.a. Portland Trail Blazers,
Buffalo Bills, Susan Lucci),
the Turner/Fonda—loved
Braves have consumed the
appetizer (two National
League Championships) only
to fall on the biggest of big
nights —— the four-to-seven
nights in late October known
as the Fall Classic.

Sure, they’re talented. Sure,
they’ve played in two Fall
Classics. But let’s see them
drenched in World Series
champagne before we all sat-
urate them with praise fit for
more worthy title holders.

Twins before them. Thank
You.

have good goaltending and play
stingy defensive, and that’s what I
can help bring to this team — ‘a
good defensive defenseman who
takes pride in keeping the puck
out of his net.”

While there have been very
few roster moves since he was

Pens are playing on a totally dif-
ferent level this season. Both the

rest of the West.

Tracking the Tomahawkers
in second place this year will
be the second-best team in
baseball, the Cincinnati
Reds. Thanks to three huge
offseason acquisitions -
John Smiley (free agent from
Minnesota), Kevin Mitchell
(trade from Seattle) and
Roberto Kelly (trade from the
Yankees) — first-year Coach
Tony Perez and the Schott—
less Redlegs will indeed have
the legs and ar_ms to push the
95—win mark by October.

The dubious duo tlfat will
likely decide whether the
Reds push the 100—win mark
'— and a shot at overtaking
the Braves —— is Smiley and
Mitchell. While Smiley owns
more wins the past two years
than rival free agent signee
Maddux (36-35), he has yet
to establish himself as a top-
flight stud capable of stand-
ing tall in the big game. As

at an incredible pace, and the
desire to win a third Cup is like
nothing this city has ever seen.

Taglianetti asserts, however,
that this is the same team that he
left last year.

“Not a thing [is different]. It
feels like I never even left. The
guys joke around the same, they
totally act the same, when you
come in they treat you the same.
It’s hard to explain, but it’s like I
never even left this locker room.”

for Mitchell, last seen float-
ing over the Superdome in
New Orleans for the NCAA
Championships, the question
still remains whether this
dinger-blaster turned
dumpling-downer will ever
return to'his Frisco self (32
homers, 91 runs batted in per
year).

Chances are one of two is
probable for the Mitchell-
Smiley monster. It’ll help, but
it won’t be enough.

Speaking of enough, the
management of the Houston
Astros apparently didn’t
know the definition of the
word‘ (see the pay stubs of
Mr.’s Drabek and Swindell).
