M. Cohan in theititle role, the‘com_- -—

edy enjoyed extended runs both in

New York and on the road. It was
ﬁresented some years ago in Pitts-

urgh at the Nixon Theatre. Fol-
lowing the stage production, the
story was transferred to the screen
in a ﬁlm starring Bert Lytell. A
talking screen version of the play is
also scheduled to be produced with-
in the next year by First National

Cathedral of Learningto Be Enclosed

In Trillions

 

‘40,000 Pieces of Cut Stone to
Enclose Cathedral

By HIRAM HOVVARD

A carload a day, 250 or 400 to the’
load, until there are 40,000 pieces

of cut stone, each mortared into its
predesigned niche, and the Cathedral
of Learning-eiwill be completely en-
closed in—sea shells!

For the famous Indiana limestone
that is »now beginning to cover the
steel frame rising 510 feet above
Frick Acres is» nothing but a con-
glomeration of tiny sea shells ce-
mented tightly together.

Under the microscope, you can see
them. A million ages ago, in the
oolitic era, they were welded into
rock after thearm of the. sea that
had covered for centuries what is
now the Mississippi River valley had
receded back down to the Gulf of
Mexico and left behind it a layer of
limestone made up of billions of the
shells.

Seasoned First.

Now, at Bedford, Indiana, itis
quarried in tons for building stone.
But unlike marble,-A on being taken,

<‘>

   

moisture ‘it contains, it has to be
seasoned for four months. ._
end of this time, it is hard enough
to cut to shape. Powerful steel
saws, some of which are edged with
diamonds, cut the stone as if it were
so much wood. '

Stone cut for the_ Cathedral is
ﬁnished in several different ways.
It is either plain cut, shot cut, or
channel ﬁnished but each‘ stone is
made different. from others by some
variation in these treatments. This
is done to give the stone’ for the
Cathedral the same, beautiful indi-
viduality and variety of surface in
the masonry work that ’c, aracterizes
so many famous Old orld build-
ings. In Europe this effect was se-

cured -byhand ﬁnishing each stone.

Resists, Weather.
Besides‘ its beauty, Indiana. lime-
stone was also -selected for the

Cathedral from a utilitarian point of‘

view. Because of -its resistance ‘to
the effectszof extreme heat .or cold,
it is especially suited to Pittsburgh
climate. In time, too, its surface
becomes practically jimpervious to
water. '

For this reason, great precaution is

A single broken. stone might de-

be cut and shi ped from Indiana.
The stone is un oaded from the car
by a special crane and placed in
scale boxes carried on trucks for
transportation to Frick Acres- For
safety, it is packed in excelsior. At
the Cathedral, another special crane
lifts the stone fromthe scale boxes

I. C. C. APPOINTS

 H0wA_gp.,K1DD

-‘Dr. Howard C. Kidd, professor of
commerce, has been appointed by
the Pennsylvania Public Service
Commission to make a survey of the
‘effect a proposed consolidation of

railroads. would have in Pennsyl-
vania. The appointment has been
Fisher. » .
fThe, plan proposed by the Inter-
state Commerce Commission 1S to

approved by Governor John S.

consolidated all railroads ‘in the.

country into twenty systems. Dr.
Kidd is to study what effect such
action will have on movement of
traffic in the state, what economic
saving there will be, and What the
reaction, of Pennsylvania shippers
and railroads will be. The report
will later be submitted to the I. C.
C. and to any federal and state

agencies that desire it.

Professor Kidd has made eco-
nomic surveys in South America,
the Near East and Europe. In 928,
after the consolidation of 120. . rit-
ish railroads into four. he made an
extensive. study of the causes and
effects of the grouping. As a result
of this survey he published the
book, “New Era for British Rail-
roads.” ‘ '

Chairman of the Public -Service
Commission, Mr. William D. Ainey,
said, ,“The governor and the“ com-
mission feel that they are fortunate
in securing one who is an outstand-
ing transportation economist in this
country to accept this appointment.”

The Pitt xriﬂe team started their

both Columbia. and Gettysburg. The
showing of the Pitt squad in these
postal matches “bodes well. for their
showingthe rest of the season. _

, Thefgunnersiran zup a score of
1,326 which is by. far better than
any,.ofthe pearly marks for any of
the riﬂe" teams in many seasons.
Lastyear the riﬂe squad scored
1,290, points in; their first match of
the year .with Columbia, at that
timers- yery» imposing total. ’

For several _ reasons _ the Campus
Scout comesbefore you today  his?

In fact ‘we’d feel‘ rnuch better if ‘we
couldturn this column over to Coach

Rockne, or the chairman of. the

. But apologies at their best are;
poor excuses. , Yet, -imagine,

Coach Sutherland telling you,
what he thinks ofthe Pitt team‘ -
this year, his "opinion on _ all-
American picking, or even what
he ‘thinks the -result " of at‘ Pitt-
Notre Dame post-season game ‘ -
would be. Surely, any of these
-would be interesting, but it so
happens, contrary. to the general
opinion, that Coach Sutherland ,
does not write the . Campus»
Scouts - - . i
As to the secondgentleman, Coach.
Steffen, he would not evenhave to
write anything new. A reprint of
his article on what he thinks would
happen should , Pitt. meet Notre
Dame, which ran; recently in-a down-
town newspaper, would be‘ more than

«interesting -to Pitt students. Good

old Wally, we like him. just the same,

Tech game. It-was the first time in
years that the “Judge” failed to don

Chicago bench, Wally Steffen is
among the best, but writing for
newspapers -is
matter. - \
. ___Q____
Thirdly, the Scout would give
his yellow--striped pajamas - to‘
the eminent Knute K. Rockne, _
that master builder .of national
championship football ~_ teams-
" west of Pittsburgh, if the Irish-
mentor, now at a slight physical
disadvantage, would write“ us a
little story on just what he
. thinks would be the result of at
Pitt-Notre Dame game this-sea‘-
son. Really, boys and. girls, your
Scout would give up Santa-‘
Claus’ annual visit to his humble
domicile in lieu of ’ reading
I Rockncfs opinion on this matter.
Even. a little dissertation by
‘Rockne on the subject of “Mak-,
ing the Telephone Business a.
Paying Proposition and Winning
Football Games,” would be
quite entertaining. As you prob-
ably know. the bedfast. Rockne-
has sent his players into most
of their games this season via

telephone seanccs. - -
