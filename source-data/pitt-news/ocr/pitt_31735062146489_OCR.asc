Eorum Season Ends 
With Denunciation

Of K11 Klux: Klan

That the Ku Klux Klanis above all
un-American was the statement made
by Louis Broido in an address before
the Open Forum at the campus "Y”
Tuesday, May.-,,,20.. ,“It is responsible,”
the speaker asserted, “for the viola-
tion of three cardinal constitutional
rights, religious, economic, and polit-
ical liberty.” ’ E .

.Mr. Broido’s talk follows in part:

Not only does the Klan violate re-
ligious liberty of American citizens
by creating unreal‘ distinctions. be
tween national groups, but, by sup-
porting an unscientiﬁc immigration
policy-it prevents much valuable hu-
man’ material from entering the coun-
try, an act which constitutes econom-
ic ,discrimination. 2 Moreover, the

.Klan' is undoubtedly in'polit‘ics, in ac-

tual effect, if not organically, since
a candidate who is known to beta
Klansman is ‘naturally supported by
his fellow members. This factmeans

, that inessential political‘ issues are

that all money collected by solicitors
and not yet reported should be turn-
ed over immediately to the campaign
treasurer, C. V. Starret, in the office
of The Pitt Panther, so that the
amount raised by tag-selling can be

PITT‘ SPIRIT‘
Students’ _Th0u1ght Editor,
(Dear *Sir:"——  . .. L
College lspirltcir is proverbial; -we
cannot conceive of an American col-
legs. or university without its share,
great or small of loyalty and spirit.
It is part of the school and it leaves
its stamp on every Lman who goes
through that school. School: spirit‘ is

-‘a character-builder. ’

cN‘o'w what can we say for Pitt
Here we are in the middle
of a,» big city which supports two
other large schools. “The majority‘
of our students are commuters, here
only for classes. We cannot yet
boast of dormitories where those
students who do stay at the Univer-

these recognized handicaps, 
Spirit can be far greater thanc“’°“it
now is. If Pitt football spirit Jnade
up all of Pitt Spirit. there would ‘be
no need nor cause for this article
for there is , no" room‘ for
complaint on that phase of it.
But aside ‘from football. there are
other athlletic activities and many
equally important non-athletic activ-
ities such. as classpresidencies and
student government offices. These
positions carry responsibility and
demand ability on the part of the
holders. Pitt Spirit is never. more
lax than on ‘election days. Few vote
and fewer yet" knovrfor whom and
why they are voting. Of course pol-
tics carries the day- Paying more
attention to school activities and af-
fairs is the way to make practicable
and valuablel all these generalized
and vague ideas or Pitt Spirit.

-There is no better way to get a
man interested. in his school and
what it is doing than by givinghim
something to do which will give
play to his creative ability and will
force him, to accept some responsi-
bility. But the men and Women of
college age know that they must
help themselves into these posi-
tions. No one is goinag to hand one
to them all wrapped up in tissue pa-

par and ‘tied with a red ribbon. Put

your car in. What you learn from
handling more or less responsible
jobs will ; not be the least partof
your college education. And just
as it beneﬁts you it will! beneﬁt
the University. Pitt Spirit must be
active interest and ‘enthusiasm or
nothing, It is not so important
that . you talk up Pitt Spirit but
work it up! .
Do yep; believe in your school?
Do" you boost it when talking with
others? That is good, but do some-
thing «in it and for’ it. -

ers Take 10' of 15 Firsts

With 10 first places out of ‘a p_os-
sible 15, and seven clean sweeps, the
Panther trackmen had things all to
their own satisfaction in the mid-
week meet staged at Beaver Falls last
Wednesday afternoon with Geneva
College. The ﬁnal score was 94 to 41.

The Panthers runners scored all
three places in three running events,
the half mile, mile and two mile, and

in four ﬁeld events, the javelin throw ,

the broad jump, high jump and the
pole vault. ,

Geneva showed strength in the
sprints, hurdles, discus and the ham-
mer throw, taking- first in the 220
yard dash, both hurdle events, the
discus and scoring a clean sweep in
the hammer event.

The feature of the meet was (30-
wan’s victory in the century dash
over Geneva’s star, Butler, who until
the Pitt meet had been undefeated
this year. Cowan’s victory was made
all the more noteworthy when he was
forced to run from a foot beyond
scratch because of a previous break,
but the Panther star made up the dis-
tance in short. order winning in time
that tied the track record. Butler
came back in the 220-Ya-rd dash, win-
ning in record; time from Perry of
Pitt in one of the prettiest races of
the day.

Martin won a fine quarter, leading
from start to finish, but was closely
pressed throughout by Perry of Pitt,
who was nosed out of second place
by inches. Perry was also third -in
the 100 and second in the‘ 220-yard
dashes. . ’

Cost won the mile, with White and
Schroedel close by, and Corbett won
the two-mile with A-Schroedel and
White ﬁnishing in that order. ‘Cor-
bett set the pace throughout, with
Schroedel tagging at his heels to the
ﬁnish almost in a dead heat. Both
runners came close to lapping the
only Geneva runner in ,the event.
Powell fought hard to beat White for
a third place but was not equal to his
teammate’s sprint. Fabiani took sec-

counted for the other. Haddon scored
three and Bradford one for the Little.
Washington outﬁt. .

In beating Wade King, Pitt, Al Had-
don, W. & J., proved to be the real
luminary of the day. His long~»driv-
ing can well be credited as the reason
for the victory. On the ﬁfteenth he
overdrove the green--a drive of some
290 yards—i—-which goes to‘ show his
splendid form. ‘ P

It took Tom Canon just two holes
to make his rally good, beating Brad-
ford with a medal score of 78 to 80.
- Zimmerman defeated Fulton, 4 and

stride on the return jaunt. He had a

Laneve shot a 77 "to Schade’s 86,
giving a score of 5 and 4 in their
round. Laneve playedwonderful golf
the whole distance, holding the ad-
vantage throughout,  _,

Wade King put’ up a ystiﬂf battle
against Haddon in their play, but
failed .to cope with the W. & J. star's
wonderful work with the wood. The
Wash;-eJeff. linksman held the Pitt-
man 1 up on the turn, and ﬁnally let
things go even on the tenth, when
he holed out with a 5 to King's 4. The
Panther, however, dropped to the rear
again when Haddon started his rally,
the match winding up with a 77 to 80
