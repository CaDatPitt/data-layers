Seven years ago Pitt had 108 black
faculty members and a federal court
ordered the university to desegregate the
faculty. In 1988, the deadline established
for these efforts, Pitt black faculty members
numbered 94.

“[In 1983] the university said two things.
They said we admit that we have done
very badly, but we promise that we will do
better. Five years later, the fact of the
matter is they have not done better,” said
Dennis Brutus, chairperson offthe black
studies department.

“Overall the total pattern is as bad as it
was five years ago. What’sthe explanation?
I think that there was a lack of will in the
university from the top all the way through
the administration. There were no people
who genuinely wanted to bring about
change. They would pay lip service to

change. They would make the right noises.
They would use the right rhetoric. But
they were not interested in action to
support the rhetoric,” Brutus said.

Pitt was one of 18 Pennsylvania state-
funded schools which were given a five-
year period, starting in 1983, in which to
desegregate faculty and student bodies.
The order was issued by a federal court in
response to a suit ﬁled by the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People Legal Defense Fund in
1968.

The Pitt case is still under investigation,
according to Paul Wood’ of the U.S.
Department of Education's Office of Civil
Rights.

More than a year after these special
efforts were to have been made, Pitt is still
unsure of how to implement an effective
affirmative-action program.

The University Senate Committee on

Affirmative Action, chaired by School of

Social Work Professor and University
Senate President Barbara Shore, released
a report on the state of affirmative action
in 1989 that called for Pitt to set aside
funds specifically for the recruitment of
black faculty.

“There were different viewpoints outside
the committee on that from the
administration, whether we needed extra
money or whether it should be money in
the mainstream budget,” said Shore.

“We didn’t strongly care as long as
adequate money was put aside and as
long as departments and schools knew
that money would be available should
they need it,” she said.

According to Shore, the committee
wanted to have the funds set aside to
guarantee that when recruitment efforts
were in progress, department heads could
make competitive offers to prospective
black faculty.

the record shows our good intentions in
the past have not worked because we
simply did not have the funds set aside to
do the job.”

Plotnicov and Shore’s ideas are not
shared by Pitt’s administration which has
maintained that it can carry out a successful
affirmative— action program without setting
aside several million dollars specifically
for minority salaries.

“It would be wonderful to have a pot of
several million dollars from which we hire
minority faculty. That is neither realistic,
practical [nor], 1 think, politically at the

moment, advisable,” said Provost Donald '

Henderson. “We don't have a pot of
money from which we can draw in order
to make these things happen; so I would
rather deal in what’s real.”

Detre defends
integrity of Pitt
researchers

By Jennifer Calabrese

Although a recent Congressional report charged
that researchers Pitt’s School of Medicine engaged
in misconduct, Pitt President Wesley Posvar
defended the university’s actions.

“We are confident that our dealings with the
matters of research propriety and administrative
ethics have been correct and the sanctions developed
here have been sound as result of a very, very
thorough academic analysis and several review
runs,” Posvar told a meeting of the University
Senate Council yesterday.

The report, which cited scientific misconduct at
universities that receive Public Health Service Funds,
was released yesterday. It specifically cites two
cases at Pitt, one of which involved Dr. Charles
Bluestone and research regarding the use of
amoxicillin, an antibody which is prescribed to
children with ear infections.

Bluestone was accused of conﬂict of interest by
his assistant, Erdem Cantekin. Cantekin said that
B1uestone’s acceptance of funding from
pharmaceutical companies may have inﬂuenced
his research. Bluestone ‘was cleard of those
allegations by three university panels.

“I would like to reassure you that the claim that
the conﬂict of interest influenced the findings,
reported by the investigators in a favorable way is
simply not the case,” said Senior Vice President For
Health and Sciences Thomas Detre.

“I think is important to note is that the perception
of improporiety is very different from impropriety,"
Detre said.

Detre said personally, “there is no question in my
mind that it is a sounder policy to prohibit people
who do federal research to accept contributions
from pharmaceutical companies.”

Associate Provost for Research Wilfried Daehnick
said that he is working with the research counsel
and the general university counsel to avoid problems
in the future by incorporating a disclosure provision.

Video got mes used to  stress

By Tammy Poole
For The Pitt News ‘

Western Psychiatric Institute & Clinic has designed video games that attempt to
predict how a person’s reaction to stress may be a risk factor for heart disease.

The lab games measure each subject on the basis of eye-hand coordination,
memory ability and accuracy of timing. Each game is designed to cause a change

in the subject's cardiovascular system.’

According to research specialist T om Devski, the first phase of the study will
measure the length of time needed for a subject to restbefore and after playing the

video games. . ~

For this preliminary survey, only males between the ages of 18 and 30 are

required to participate.

“Subjects are asked to play the games so that we can raise the blood-pressure rate
and determine how long it will take for the participant to rest again once they've
ﬁnished performing the tasks,” said Devski, a behavioral» neuroscience graduate

from the University of Pittsburgh.

“Based on those conclusions, we will continue to the next phase of the
experiment using the resting periods and video games that gave us the best

results," he said.

Similar studies scheduled for October will involve the use of cardiography
measures to monitor changes in blood pressure, heart rate and pulse waves.

The truth is that most students

feelings of uneasiness or anxiety.
Sometimes these anxious feelings
are mild and pass quickly once
the student gets caught up with
the excitement of college life.

At other times, the problem may
be more severe. This may be the
result of separation from a very
supportive family or from a
particularly close friend. In some
instances, students come from
small towns where they were well-

Enghsh department, law school successful with black recruiting

By Mindy Boffemmyer

and Jennifer Calabrese
The Pitt News

The English department and the law school at the
University of Pittsburgh are successfully recruiting black
faculty, according to Associate Provost Jack Daniel.

"Every time I turn around they are able to find people
who bring them credentials from Yale [and] Stanford,"
Daniel said.

“We try very, very hard. There is, I think, in the English
department, a very strong feeling [...] to bring black
faculty to the department. So in one sense, you could say
we are united from within, ” said Philip Smith, chairperson
of the English department.

Smith said that the key to success in this area is making
Pitt an attractive place for black faculty.

“We have tried to create undergraduate and graduate
programs that represent the subjects of literature and
writing in a way that would attract black faculty to come
here and teach,” Smith said. '

“We have courses in black literature. We try to [include]
black writers in other courses that are not speciﬁcally
about black literature. We try to pay serious attention to
problems of class, race and gender in the courses that we
teach, and we try through our program in cultural and
critical studies to, in other words, give serious attention
to intellectual questions that would be interesting to
black faculty,” he said.

Smith said that the administration has played an

important role in aiding his efforts.
“I think that we have been successful in hiring because

Majority of Pitt students have

the administration has been in support of our efforts. That
has included making available to us, not necessarily extra
money, but I would say extra ﬂexibility when we have
needed it in the recruitment operations or in making
arrangements with potential black faculty,” he said.
Smith doesn’t think colleges should place emphasis on

3

the financial aspect of attracting black faculty.

“I think none of us [want] to be involved in a kind of
market-driven bidding war that in effect takes away the
educational reasons — that is, the kinds of things that
people [...] might want to come for that are extraneous to
salary. Those are things like departmental support,
curriculum and so on," he said.

“This is a way of saying we are not going out with a fat
wallet and saying, ‘We’ll try to hire black faculty at
whatever the cost.’ We are going out to say, ‘We would
like to attract people who are seriously interested in
teaching in our department because [...] they want to
come to Pitt because of what Pitt does and represents.’
And if they have that interest, .and if we can generate a
program that will attract them to that interest, that is the
foundation of recruitment. Then we will talk about
salary.”

Pitt’s law school has also had a successful program, but
officials attribute its progress to connections with the
Association of American Law Schools.

“We're assisted by a national organization that gets
involved in recruiting faculty nationwide each year. [It]
makes a number of efforts to contact minority faculty
candidates and then make those candidates available to
all of the law schools around the country. That's a helpful
device,” said Associate Dean Margaret Mahoney.

Of 32 tenured and tenure-stream professors in the law
school, three are black. “We also make a lot of efforts on
our own. We contact everybody we can think of [who]
might have suggestions about minority lawyers in the
Pittsburgh community or elsewhere or [people] who
might have an interest in law teaching," she said.

point of view to do it within the
sources that we have rather than
count on something that is more
in the domain of wishful thinking
than it is in reality,” he said.

“I’ve said to deans,
[Chairpersons] and others that we
as an institution are committed to
afﬁrmative action, and we will
fulfill those commitments; and
because it is an institutional
priority, we take it right off the
top. We don’t have to go begging
in order to get it.” .

But some campus leaders are
afraid that the “off—the- top” funds
won’t be available when the time
comes to hire a black faculty
candidate.

“I don’t believe the university
will give the money when the
time comes. Once prospective
faculty is brought in front of them,
I think they'll say, ‘We'd like to

' hire" you, ‘but’ we don’t ' have the

money.’ Something will happen
to the money in the meantime,

_ [but] the money is there for the

sports center,” said Black Action

' Society Chairperson Doug Ligons.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar
stands behind the off-the-top
approach, and said that to his
knowledge there has never been
an occasion where a chairperson
presented a qualified candidate
and the money was not available.

“When you say ‘qualiﬁed,’ it
means fully qualified with a desire
to be here; our policy is to find
the money because it is a top
priority," Posvar said.

“Take the [Faculty of Arts and
Sciences], which  recruits ..
let's say, 50 or 60 [faculty
members] and has been very

successful in recruiting four or,

five [minorities]. They simply are
supposed to give their very top
priority to minority faculty, and
that is supposed to come off of
the top. And even if we are short
of funds, we find the money

person for lack of funds. I am
sure that it has happened on
occasion through error or
oversight or mismanagement,”
Posvar said.

Henderson added that besides
the practical aspects, set-"asides
also have other disadvantages.

“At least from where I sit, the
set-asides are relegation to
second—class citizenship all over
again. So if there have to be
special monies for the black
faculty or other minorities  that
we bring here, then they come
here in a special status; that is not
desirable either for them or for
the institution. They should be
full participants in the educational
and research processes of this
institution without any strings
attached to their involvement. at
all,” he said.

Ligons disagreed. “As long as
you recruit qualified faculty, you
won’t have“ any problems with
inferiority complexes.”

Not all of Pitt’s administrators
stand behind the set—aside
principle.

“Whether you set aside or
whether you take it from the top,
there has to be a substantial sum.
of money if we want to progress
in faculty and student affirmative
action. For me it might be a bit of
semantics to talk about set- aside
or off-the-top,” said Associate
Provost Jack Daniel.

“What I want is the result, and
that is more black faculty and
more black students here; so
whether it is set—aside or off-the-
top, I don’t really care, but I
know that we cannot do that
without significant amounts of
money."

Daniel said, "One thing that I
would point to is that I don’t
think we are sufficiently pro-active
in terms of recruiting faculty
members. I think in the last year
we have seen progress, but [if]
you want to be successful in this
ijery difficult area, then you have
tp be much more pro-active. You

opportunity. You have to be
constantly looking, even when
you don’t have a formal search
applied. I think in the past we just
haven’t been sufficiently pro-
active with regard to faculty,” he
said.

’ Ligons said that part of the
reason for the lack of black faculty
is this: “They don’t aggressively
recruit like other universities. Not
only are they not going out there,
but they’re going out with weak
offers. With weak offers, the only
faculty you’re going to get are
weak faculty.”

According to Plotnicov,
“Competent black faculty are
scarce and in high demand, and
therefore, the universities are in
more severe competition for such
faculty and are willing to pay a
higher price to have them.”

And in a tight budget year,
many faculty wonder whether
Pitt will be able to make any
progress on the affirmative- action
front. " ' '

reason for their lack of progress.

But Henderson said that Pitt
can use its limited resources to
acquire black faculty, but it will
have to be on a smaller scale.

“Our resources are limited,
which is why it strikes me that we
ought to use the resources we
have to go in an aggressive way
after minority faculty because we
are assured if we make the effort,
we are assured of the existence
of resources to acquire them.
That may mean that we acquire
fewer minority faculty, but that’s
the name of the game. If we are
serious, then that is what we do;
so that is the approach that I
prefer to take," Henderson said.

Money isn’t the only thing that
competitive schools can offer

Brutus agreed that the university
should provide prospective black
faculty members with perks.

“In order to make the job more
attractive, the university [will] add
certain perks, which will persuade
that person to come, if that person
is black and already has a good
position elsewhere, you are going
to have to offer something extra
to make the position attractive.
Whether the university does that
or not I don’t know. Whether

they are willing to do it or not I _

they ought to be willing to,” Brutus
said.

“Sometimes it is a question of a

essential aspect of his work today.
Gutkind has been a teacher at Pitt

since 1969, after he completed his bachelor's

degree from the College of General Studies. A

He currently is the chairperson of Pitt’s

Gutkind presently divides his time among
teaching, researching his eighth book and

Take whatever initiatives you
can to meet new friends and to
become involved in campus
activities. Volunteering to help
other people through the campus
YMCA or similar organizations is
also an effective way of opening
doors to new friendships and
.fighting off your own
uncomfortable feelings.
Another way of helping yourself
is to make" an appointment with a
counselor at the Counseling
Center (648-7930). If you are very
depressed or in a state of panic
about your situation, tell the
scheduling secretary that you
need to see someone right away.
Don’t give up on yourself. You
can get past this problem and go
on to a successful college career
as many other students who
preceded you have. Just don’t feel
that you have to do it alone.
if you have a concern that you

of the arm, will be worn by the
subject for the experiment.

According to the consent forms,
the equipment is safe. The form
also noted that the persons
involved with monitoring the
experiment have tried to prevent
electrical shock.

Subjects will not be allowed to
continue to participate in the study
if their blood—pressure reading
goes over 200. The normal blood-

, pressure reading fis 120.

“Because we use a relatively
healthy population of people that
do not have a history of high
blood pressure, we haven't seen
anyone even get remotely close
to the point when we would have
to stop the experiment,” said
Devski.

When asked how each
participant prepares for the
survey, Devski said there are
restrictions during the period prior
to the experiment that will help to
produce good resting measures.

“We require that the subjects
stay away from any tobacco, such
as chewing tobacco [and] cigarette
smoke, any strenuous exercises,
caffeine and eating,” he said.

“Those restrictions will
[promote] a workable resting
measure.”

The present experiment, which
involves testing the length of time
for resting periods, is advertised
in the William Pitt Union. It is a
two to three hour study, and the
participant will receive $5 for
every hour of performance.

information involving those who
volunteer for the study are strictly

Daehnick added that, “In

considerable hesitation on

Posvar supported
Daehnick’s suggestion.

“I have long favored such

wouldn’t call it discloure
becausde it would be totally
conﬁdential. But, many, I’d
say most major research

tenure-track positions,” he said.
“Obviously that’s important to
black faculty. They're getting it at
other universities. They aren't
getting it here.”

Daniel said that the campus
environment is another factor in
attracting black faculty.

“There is another problem that
is hard to explain, but it has to do
with the environment of the
campus and what it is like to be
a black person or a member of
any minority group on a campus
like this. This is a predominantly
white campus numerically and
culturally,” Daniel said.

“The next time you go around

' the campus today, look at the art

in the offices that you go into.
Well, for the most part, it won't
be art that speaks to black people.
Look at the names of the halls
and the buildings here. We don’t
go to Martin Luther King Hall for
a class; we don’t go to Malcolm X
Hall for a class. For the most part,
places to go for entertainment
are places that are based on
values and beliefs of people other

‘ than African Americans. It just all

adds up in the sense. that you are
conscious of the fact that for the
most part [the environment]

personal set of beliefs and values, ”

committee has narrowed the field
to a few candidates whom they
are seriously considering. Much
of the lack of black faculty,
according to Posvar, is that faculty
who sit on search committees
are not willing to pick a black
candidate.

“It really comes down to the
department chair or whoever
happens to be heading the search
committee. Despite our best
intentions institutionally and our
best policies in terms of public
declarations, this priority has to
get inside the mind of the
recruiter,” Posvar said.

Brutus said that part of the
problem is due to the makeup of
the search committees.

“It seems to me there are [three]

elements here. One, very often
black faculty do not sit on search
committees. Two, even when they
do sit on, they are in the minority,
so their vote is a very minor
contribution to the ﬁnal decision.
And three, more importantly,
generally the pool of candidates
which the search committee is
going to look at is predominantly
composed of majority candidates,
so that they are limited in their
choice and in their inﬂuence,” he
said; '

_ Universities across the country
are competing to recruit the small
pool of black candidates.

doctorate degree in computer
science in a year. So if you want
to hire a black person in computer
science at Pitt, the top 50 or 60
universities in the country are
competing for the two or three
who happen to come out,” said
Daniel. “The same pool problem
exists in the natural sciences.
There you are talking about one,

- or I think, anywhere from .3 to

[15 percent] of blacks earn a
doctorate degree in thosefields.
The same thing [goes for] applied
sciences, such.as”eIngineering or
business. So there is a very serious
shortage in terms of supply.”

Pitt’s black students, who
currently have a dropout rate of
64 percent, are especially
concerned with the recruitment
and retention of black faculty.

“With black faculty, students
don’t have the pressure of racism, ”
Ligons said.

According to Henderson, black
students are missing out because
of the lack of black faculty.

“If students see and grow up
with people who are doing these
kinds of things, it makes it

S immediately apparent that they

too can do these kinds of things,”
Henderson said.

“In addition to that, however,
is the fact that there is a Sensitivity,
which isn't to say that white faculty
are not sensitive. But there is a
peculiar sensitivity that black
faculty can bring not only [into]
instruction  but also to their
colleagues with regard to these
matters. The absence of a
sufficiently large number of black
faculty at Pitt sure has had an
impact on the success potential
of students here. In broader terms,
it has had an impact on the success
potential of all students.”

Student Government Board
President Julie Shepard said that
the university will not be able to
increase the number of minority
students without black faculty
serving as role models.

7 B—U€K&§ A'Mi~:'NY)1sIE1'§fT"

 

“There can be other incentives,
but if you come to a school
where you don't have anyone
that has made it through
something that you are trying to
do and that you may be struggling
with, [then you are less likely to
stay],’’ she said.

O O 0

Daniel thinks that there has
been more than enough study of
the black—faculty problem.

“I think that we have all of the
strategies, tactics and knowledge
of what to do that we need in this
university. If we formed another
committee right now to talk about
devising strategies to recruit black
faculty, it would be a waste of
university resources. I have more
reports about that topic in this
university than we need. We need
not discuss it again; we know
what to do. The problem is one
of implementation,” he said.

Daniel said the reason reforms
have not been implemented is
because “if I want to I can find at
any given point in time a white
faculty member to be the first-
choice candidate for any position.
Now why is that the case? It is the
case because for the last several
hundred years there have been
whites for the most part, political
scientists, white sociologists,
white any social science you want
to point to. They have been
writing the books; they have been
publishing the articles. I can find
50 candidates all of whom will be
superior candidates to the one or
two young blacks who graduated
in the last decade.

“So because we function on a
merit system, because publication
research [and] scholarship is so
important at a university like this,
I can always go out and ﬁnd
white males and increasingly,
white females. So as long as you
proceed with that kind of a Search
process, there is always going to
be the same result until you have
a larger, more qualified pool of
blacks. Now anyone who wants
to can exploit that reality.”

  PSYCI-IEDELIC DAY—(5I.O.

Pittsburgh's Classic Rock

Sept. 8 —- Campus police
transported an intoxicated Pitt
student, who had tripped and
fallen behind David Lawrence
Hall, from the lobby of Bruce Hall
to Presbyterian-University
Hospital. Her nose was bleeding
and bruised.

Sept. 8 —— After dispersing the
crowd of students outside the
William Pitt Union after a dance,
police were called to the Towers
lobby to break up a ﬁght. The
lobby was filled with students,
however, and police found it
difficult to move the surrounding
students. Efforts to use the public-
address system to clear the area
failed because the system has
been inoperable for some time.

Sept. 8 —— While on a routine
patrol, a campus police officer
noticed that an unknown
person(s) had broken off the
wooden arm to the entrance of
the SB lot. The officer secured the
lot. A
Sept. 9 — An officer hit her
elbow on a corner of a wall in
Trees Hall. When she noticed that
her elbow was swelling, she had
her elbow X-rayed at
Presbyterian—University Hospital.
The doctor told her that everything
was fine and that the swelling was
due to an injured tendon.

In spite of a federal-court mandate ordering the University
of Pittsburgh to increase black faculty, the total number‘ of
black faculty has declined overall during the seven years
since the mandate was issued.

Since 1983, the faculty, administration and other campus
leaders have not been able to agree on an effective
strategy for affirmative action, despite extensive discussion
and debate about the subject.

The debate centers on whether Pitt should take money
off the top of the budget for black-faculty recruitment, or
adopt thepolicy of setting aside funds specifically for that
purpose; ‘ - ‘  I J

The administration contends that setting aside a lump
"sum of money to guarantee the recruitment of black
faculty is” “unrealistic” during a tight’ budget year. But
expecting to pull funds off the top of the budget is far less
realistic. A. ”

l“Off—the—top” has been the administration’s policy
throughout this seven-year controversy, in spite of the fact
that it has provenineffective. Under this plan Pitt has failed
to come close to meeting its 1983 goal of desegregating the bind and constrain

Justice should be served‘
J, I firmly believe it is time we as
citizens of the United States stand

up and demand afair and just _,

judicial system. My faith in the
present system is non-existent,
due to many travesties of justice
that have taken place, but capped
by the article of the 10th
concerning the  “juvenile”
Oakland rapist. , m

It is a travesty that anyone
committing crimes of his
magnitude should __ get off so
lightly. Anyone who commits rape
has more than V a child’s
understanding of what is going
on. And it irks me to always see
some sort of deal being struck to
lessen sentences. It waters down

the system.
Then there’s the famous case of
Marion Barry, who tells

[Washington] D.C., kids not to
use drugs, is then videotaped
using crack, and arrested. He is
cleared of all counts except one,
and that was not even the one
involving the videotape. He got
away completely unscathed

politically, as well. What a strong
message we are sending the

children. Marijuana users in Texas
are dealt with more severely than
this prominent junkie.

There are cases in North
Carolina where a judge has set

ply helpless

harsher sentences for those
convicted of committing oral sex

, than murder. A man in a New

York subway can plug kids in the
back, who are running away, and
get off the hook, claiming self
defense. Meanwhile, women in
Maryland who lash’ back at
abusive husbands serve up to life
in prison. e

. A man who kills his kid, beats
another and is suspected of
beating a third is let out on some
paltry amount for bail (seen on
“America’s Most Wanted”). He

disappears before. trial. Those who —

are rich can kill, get released on
bond, and be free.- The poor
cannot.

. Finally, a pro-life demonstrator
was sent to the state penitentiary
for up to two years for not
promising to refrain from

participating in anti-abortion’

demonstrations. It seems clear that
the court was removing his right
to free speech, doesn't it?

The point I'm making is that
justice, in today’s system, means
different things for different
people. The rich can subvert it,
and in some instances of self
defense, the defendant pays. In
other less cut-and-dry instances,
the defendant is set free. Finally,
how can we justify being so light
on crimes such as murder and
rape and be so harsh on crimes
such as oral sex and disturbing
the peace? And, thanks to the
judicial system, the “War on
Drugs” has been delivered a
serious blow.

This is a democracy. Come on,
people, let's see if we can do
something to make the judicial

_ system judicial.

Dowling, W/yzy/eowslei
ﬂnisbﬁrst at CC meet

By Sharon Kerestes
Stajf Writer

, The men's cross—country team, paced by Keith Dowling,
placed five runners in the top six and opened its season with
a win at Kent State last Saturday. Stacey Wyzykowski won the
women’s race and led the Lady Panthers to a fourth—place ﬁnish
at the meet. _

Dowling won the men's race in 25:21, with teammate Jason
Bodnar 10 seconds behind in second place. Scott Humphrey,
Mike Formica and Jim Hamilton followed in fourth, fifth and
sixth places, respectively and provided the grouping that
resulted in a near-sweep for Pitt. -

The Panthers scored 18 points overall, followed by Malone
College of Ohio (46), Kent State University (63) and Robert
Morris Col1ege(119).

“Of course I was pleased with the win,” said Coach Jim Lear.
“I knew Malone was good, but we ran well against them. I
expected to beat them, but not nearly as bad as we did.”

Dowling is the school—record holder in the indoor and
outdoor 3,000 meters and the outdoor 10,000 meters. He was
also an All-American last year in the outdoor 10,000 and hopes
‘to achieve the same status in cross—country this season.

In the women’s meet, Pitt scored 78 points and placed fourth
behind Kent State (47), Malone (61) and Ohio Wesleyan
University (66). Baldwin Wallis finished fifth (97), and Robert
Morris ﬁnished sixth (169).

Pitt's Wyzykowski was the individual winner in 19:07, and
Laura O'Donnell placed fourth (19:52).

The meet, however, was not an accurate indication of the

capabilities of the women’s team. Injuries and some questions
over eligibility kept three runners from competing, and
consequently the Lady Panthers had difficulty ﬁelding a team.

To qualify Pitt for team scoring, Lear added Allyson Williams,
who is normally a hurdler for the track team, to the line up.

“This is the best women’s team we’ve ever had,” he said. “If
we had those three people, we could’ve been right up in it with
Kent State. Stacey and Laura finishing as they did is an
indication of what this team can do.”

Two of the three runners should return next Saturday for the
Spike Shoe Invitational at Penn State. Pitt will face much

Ann Lueinie (10) and Shelly Seanor (22) helped the Lady Panthers beat 3 teams over the weekend.

By Ryan Buncher
For The Pitt News.

Despite some erratic play, the
Pitt women’s volleyball team had
a fairly easy time defeating Eastern
Kentucky, La Salle and Kent State
in the Pitt Tournament last Friday
and Saturday at Fitzgerald Field
House.

Hitting and service errors were
a problem in the Eastern Kentucky
game, but the team still won in
three games by scores of 15-3,
15-8 and 15-7. Michele Adamson
led with 11 kills, and Jenelle
Lantagne had 36 assists.

The ‘team followed that by
dominating La Salle with only
two errors on the way to an

.outstanding .564 hitting
percentage.
“[.300] is an outstanding

percentage against a good team,”
said head coach Sue Woodstra.
The scoring went 15-1, 15-4 and
15-2. Bridget Gary, the smallest
of the Lady Panthers at 5 feet 6
inches, tied Adamson for the team
lead in kills with six.

The match against Kent State
was both impressive
frustrating. When asked what she
found upsetting about the game,
Woodstra said, “Concentration.

and 5

[Scores of] [15-]1, [15-]13 and [15-

The balanced power game, led
by Ann Marie Lucanie’s‘ Izkills,
was too much for Kent State.
Passing and service errors made
the last two games close. The
Lady Flashes actually led 12-6 at
one point in the third game.
Robin Yarish also gave Pitt
problems. i

In addition to the continued
quality play of Lucanie, Lantagne,
Adamson and Gary, the team got
a boost from the return of versatile
freshman Carrie Thornton from a
knee injury. Coach Woodstra also
pointed out the improvements in
Linda Zols’ play.

Dukes visit Fitzgerald Field House
tonight at 7:30.

“They had a new coach last
year, and they improved. They
have a new coach again this year,
and they should be improved
again, but we should be able to
handle them,” said Woodstra. A
match against this type of team is
a good opportunity for the Lady
Panthers to work on consistency.
They will follow up that match
with the Minnesota Tournament,
openning with Colorado State at
6 p.m. on Friday.

Women's tennis team beats Colonials

The Lady Panther tennis team
opened its 1990 season yesterday
against the Robert Morris College

the end, winning six of eight

The Pitt men's soccer team
evened its record this past
Saturday, suffering its first defeat
at the hands of nationally ranked
Seton Hall. The Panthers were
looking to avenge last year’s
humiliating loss to the Pirates (8-
1) and also to put themselves
atop the standings of the Big
East. But Seton Hall apparently
had other thoughts and erased
the goose egg in the Panther’s
loss column.

However, the loss can be used
as a sort of measuring stick in
comparison to last year’s squad.

In the No. 1 singles match, Julie
Loprinzi handily defeated Kelly
Sobol in straight sets, 6-1, 6-1.

“Julie is an experienced player
and did a great [job] for us today,”
said Dieffenbach.

Kathryn Bratton, the No. 2
singles player, disposed of Denise
Cefola, also in straight sets, 6-3
and 6-1.

Coach Dieffenbach said he was
pleased with Bratton’s
performance as well. The No. 3

completed the sweep of the top
three seeds, giving the Lady
Panthers a 3-0 lead by defeating
Maureen Linehan, 6-2, 6-2.

positives, and sees the loss as a
good opportunity to re-evaluate
the team and perhaps make some
changes in the squad’s makeup.

“We played a real strong game,
with the exception of the last 20
minutes of the first half,” said
Luxbacher,

One obstacle the team has
stayed clear of has been the injury
bug. With the exception of a few
players with the flu, there have ~
been no serious injuries, which
decimated the team last year and
forced players to play unfamiliar
positions.

Although the team lost, it gained

“We had to make some changes

This is it.

This is the week the Panthers
have been waiting for — for
nine months.

It’s been that long since Paul
Hackett was named head coach,
and for almost every week since,
he has been asked about this
game. Asked if he wanted to play
this game at all. Asked whether
he would have rather opened
the season with a game like this
or wait until the season has
started. Asked what. this game
means to the future of Pitt football.

Name it — Hackett’s been asked
it.

And now it's here.

“It” is the Oklahoma game.

This Saturday the Panthers will
take the field at approximately
2:00 p.m. at Memorial Stadium in
Norman, Okla., for the ﬁrst time
in 15 years. And once again,
history is not on their side.

Pitt has never won at Oklahoma
and has lost five times trying. In
fact Pitt has only beat the Sooners
once, 13-9 in 1965 at Pitt Stadium,
in the teams’ 10—game series. The
two teams tied 7-7 back in 1953.

“This [game against Oklahoma]
is the reason a kid comes to Pitt,”

‘BEAT OKLAHOMA’ is battlecry of

said Paul Hackett after the Boston
College game. “You come to Pitt
to play against the best people in
the country.”

Although Oklahoma has lost
some of its luster since being
placed on probation by the NCAA
a couple of years back, beating
the Sooners on national television
(the game will be televised by
CBS at 2 p.m.) would indeed give
the Panthers a much-needed
spark for the middle of the season.

After this game, the Panthers

don't face another Top 20 team. _

until they meet Notre Dame (Oct.
27) and Miami (Nov. 3) back to
back.

against UCLA. The game was the
Sooners’ return to national
television, where they had grown
quite accustomed to playing week
after week in previous years
before being placed on probation.
Oklahoma won’ handily, 34-14.

Another advantage for Pitt may
be that it is a non-league game for
the Big Eight-member Sooners.

The second half started out
with a change in goal and with
senior Tim Sobelman manning
the crease, as the team made
some changes and pressed the
Pirates by putting pressure on
their net.

Finally, Carsten Bishop broke
the Pirates’ defense, scoring his
first goal of the year. Ironically,
the same move the Panthers made
to stop Seton Hal1’s defenders
from pushing into the offensive
zone was their own undoing as
Bishop broke through their
defense and knocked home the
goal. The Panthers couldn’t
