1 CI T Sets Teaching
Norms, Ranks Profs

by LORETTA HORRELL
Students are not the only in-
dividuals on campus desiring in-
formation on the teaching exper-

’ tise of various professors and in-

structors. The faculty‘s interest

‘in such feedback has prompted

the renovation of a University of-
fice, the Center for the Improve-
ment of Teaching (CIT).

The CIT is actually a -revised
program of the Committee on the

~» Improvement of Undergraduate

Teaching. which had been under
the direction of former Provost
Charles Peake.

The reconstruction of the Cen-
ter has been made through ef-
forts of Dr. Jerome Schneewind,
Dean of the College of Arts and
Science; Dr. Grace Lazovik, di-
rector of the CIT office; Hobart
Harris, graduate assistant; and
Mrs. Sarah Brown, secretary.

“Essentially the office will

‘ function as a resource for the fac-

ulty,” explained Director Lazo-
vik, “especially to help‘ supply
them with feedback about their
teaching.”

“Besides building a good instru-
ment, we will be building norms
for the faculty,” Lazovik added.

Harris,elaborating on the.mean-
ing of norms, explained that their

- goal was “to set standards by

which teachers can c om p a r e
themselves.“

“What does the best teacher

do?” Harris said. “Faculty mem-
bers don’t know how to compare
themselves to other instructors.
By tanking their performance on
a scale of 10, faculty members
compare their score ‘to the high-
est score. Those teachers falling
below the highest score can strive
to improve their teaching techni-
quesf’

Faculty members will have ac-
cess to equipment at the CIT of-
fice. Specifically, television equip-
ment can be borrowed, enabling
the teacher to view his classroo
procedure. '

In order to compile the feed-
back, Lazovik and assistants have
done extensive research on exist-
ing programs at Purdue, Michi-
gan and the University of Wash-
ington. '

Lazovik stated that she and her
assistants have been “organizing
the best student opinion question-
naire that is possible.” The ques-
tionnaire will tap all dimensions
of student judgement on the type
of instructor that constitutes a
good teacher,’.’ she said.

The questionnaire will be dis-
tributed to_ a random selection ‘of
all faculty members’ classes. The

‘instructor will be asked to leave

the classroom’ while the survey is
administered.

Analysis of the data will be done
during winter term. The com-
pleted brochure will then be-dis.-
tributed to faculty members.

To Pressure Unfair Landlords

  Student ants Une

by GLENDA MINSHULL

In the future, students living in
off-campus facilities will have the
support of the newly formed Stu-
dent Tenant Union.

Approximately two dozen inter-
ested students attended the organ-
izational meeting Wednesday,
where Frank Little, chairman of
the Off-Campus Housing Com-
mittee and Bob Ging, committee

member, _,outlined- the purposes,

and goals of the tenant union.

Basically, the union will act as
a pressure group against land-
lords whose unfair rental prac-
tices are directed against stu-
dents. The possible recourses
open to such an organization in-

clude rent strikes, court litiga-~

tion, and political pressure, since
arecent court decision ruled that
voter registration of students in
the area in which they reside -is
constitutional.

Ging pointed out that initially
the union will not be effective
after a couple of years, though,the
union can effectively control land-
lord exploitation of students. He

cited examples of tenant unions —

at the University of Wisconsin in
Madison,7Wis., and UCLA in Berk-
eley, Calif., where the unions have
successfully fought to improve
off-campus housing.

The union will focus its atten-
tion at the local level on individ-
uals by organizing around a parti-
cular landlord. Students renting
from the same landlord, who owns

Muddy Lot Anglers Commuters

by BOB GEDEKOH
The conflict between the Com-

' muter Association and John Kat-

sur, a parking lot operator flared
anew this week when a car owned
by a Pitt student became en-
trenched in the mud at the Katsur

- lot.

Senior Conni Doyle spent one
hour before she managed to get
her car off the hidden cement pil-
lar which caught the bottom of her
car after the wheels sunk in.

She’ was forced to park in a poor
section of the lot because no at-
tendant directed lot_patrons that
morning and somestudents "used
more than the alloted space per
car. No ‘attendant was available
to help her move her car.

Although the CA no longer har-
bors ambitions of operating the
lot itself, President Tom Gainan

noted that many CA members are -

upset by conditions at the lot.
Gainan admitted that Katsur had
made a few minor improvements
but added, “I would like to take a
University official to see the new-
improved Katsur lot. Students are
already getting stuck in the mud
and it is only September.”

Another wave of complaints
came from students who wished
to attend the Pitt-Oklahoma game

on Saturday. They claimed that
the high rates charged by Katsur
prohibited many students from
parking in the lot, while non-stu-
dents who were better able, to pay
the high rate used the space.

 

KATSUR LOT: Parking without "comfort.
Photo by Mark Lieberman

One CA member argued that
since the lot is owned by the
school the spaces should be made
available to students wishing to
attend University activities at a
reasonable rate, rather than to
non-students.

Katsur rents the site from the
University for $3,600 a year.
Rates for students are seven dol-
lars monthly or $12 dollars bi-
monthly. These rates do not in-
clude parking for special weekend
events.

Katsur called the CA office re-
cently and proposed a blanket $5
student parking fee for all home
games. He ‘also offered a three
dollar monthly rate for night

‘ parking for_‘Genera1 Studies stu-

  

dents. Action has not been taken
on these proposals.

University Treasurer David
Smith conceded that Katsur is not
obeying all ‘city regulations re-
garding lot operations. These re-
quire the paving of the lot, the
planting of trees and the presence
of an attendant at all times. These
regulations are allegedly not be-
ing enforced against lot opera-
tors whose lots were in opera-
tion during the years before the
creation of these regulations.

Smith noted that if the students
demand the improvement of the

.,lot through the enforcement of

these regulations, the University

many apartments, will form a
branch of the union to settle their
problems. Students whose land-
lords own only a small complex
will join forces to bring collec-
tive pressure against their sep-
arate landlords.

A parent steering committee,
composed of representatives
from each of the local groups will
co-ordinate the union’s activities.

Ging emphasized that “a strong
effective organization on the 10-

cal level is the best means of

bringing pressure against the land-
lord.“

Initially, the union will try to in-
form students of their rights as
tenants. A booklet is now being
prepared, which will acquaint stu-
dents with their rights and the
possible legal recourses available
to them.

Students at the meeting volun-
teered to contact other tenants in
their apartment buildings to gath-
er support for the union and to
find out what specific grievances
tenants have with their housing.

The studentsagreed to meet
sometime in the next few weeks

forts. By that time, they may have

According to Little, “The union .

Ron Cowell, head of the Univer- ‘

“has promised the union an office

County’s Youth Registration

May Be‘ Nation’s Largest

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

On the basis of unconfirmed-

statistics, Allegheny County is ex-
pected to earn the distinction of
having the highest percentage of
voter registration nationwide for
young people under 21.

Jane Thompson of the Citizen-
ship‘ Information Center credits
this high instance of registration
to the efforts of the County Board
of Elections.

“The Board was really “inter-

ested in seeing as many people.

register as possible,” she said.
"They cooperated immensely with
the setting up of field registration
on all campuses. After the ruling
that dorm students could register
where they attended school, they
extended registration another
week.”

W. Holmes Isler, administra-
tive assistant of the.Board of

Elections, noted that there are no ' A

  int. '  '

reliable statistics as yet due to

this extension but‘, for valid rea-. _
sons, he said, “We are assuming ' "

that Allegheny County will sur-1‘
pass other counties,- both state-
wide and nationally.”

One of these reasons, Isler said, ‘ 

lies in the fact that the Board of
Elections started
early in the year.

Thompson explained: “Last
spring, when it" looked as if the
26th Amendment would pass,
the Board of Elections went into
the high schools and registered
seniors. These registrations were

- kept- separate from the others in

case the vote did not pass. Actual-
ly, they foresaw a flood of regis-
trations and wanted to make it a
little easier for themselves."

Isler added that with the amend-
ing of the Constitution, the Board

of Elections decided to "get their g

Upperclassmen may be sur-

Eleanor Adamets Walsh. a 1970

‘I Pitt graduate and former Pitt
‘ News reporter, has returned to

her alma mater after a year and
one-half stint as a professional
journalist to head the office of
Student Publications.

Former classmates pop in and

most like a. homecoming." Walsh
commented. smiling.

But Walsh was not motivated by
sentimentality to take the post of
Publications Director. She says
she sees a college campus as an

‘ alive, vital place for a journalist

to learn and grow and promote

‘change.

“It’s not isolated; theljcollege

she said. “Students can be a big

play in developing this under-
standing. Young. just barely out
of the youth scene. she is fired
with idealism and confidence that
campus newspapers can accom-
plish the same tasks in a college
area as professional papers do in
their circulation area.

WALSH: ‘Fired with Idealism’

“Good campus journalism isn’t
any different than professional
journalism,” Walsh affirmed. “If
there is any difference it is in the
circulation.”

She explained this by saying
that because the tastes of students
probably differ from a more gen-
eral audience. a paper's focus on

, what is news to a college campus

would be different.

Walsh said many college writ-
ers rationalize unprofessional pa-
pers with the excuse “it's just a
student effort.“ ‘But she vehe-
mently denounces this reason.

“As far as standards and cri-
teria for writing, it's the same. It
should be professional.”

The new director admitted that

a student newspaper does not
have ‘fa great deal of experienced

professionals doing the writing." .

But she said. "You have appren-
tice professionals. and in that
sense it‘s no different than a new
job on a professional paper."
Perhaps one can look back to
Walsh's own career as a Pitt
News staffer to find proof of her
convictions. As a reporter. she
won respect fr_om students and ad-
ministrators, alike on her handling

 of such stories as the financial

crisisof 1970 and the Student Gov-

» ernment election fraud:

One administrator upon learn-
ing Walsh was returning to Pitt,
said he had never seen such good
professional journalism in a col-
lege writer.

"see publications at Pitt become

amount of freedom given students
by administrators as an excellent
opportunity for students such as
those involved in student publica-
tions to effect change.

Besides. because Pitt has no
journalism department. Walsh
finds it important to give students
as much professional experience
as possible within student publi-
cations.

be,” she emphasized, “depends on
what we give them here.”

Kim Fellner, one of the few Uni-.

Asked how she intended to do
this without appearing authori—.

would make her pitch "on a per-

door basis."

She said she felt. she had an ad
vantage because she was young
and because she is already fam-
iliar with many of the student

Coffeehouse Fosters Friendship

by BOB GEDEKOH
Many American students com-

plain that they find their foreign-

counterparts cliquish and ex-
tremely serious-minded. Com-
munication between these groups
is often limited to a nod and a
smile; an invisible cultural bar-
rier prevents the exchange of
ideas which could be an integral
part of their college educations.

Foreign and American students
have a unique opportunity to meet
at the Friendship Coffeehouse,
held at the Lutheran University
Center, 4515 Forbes Ave. The cof-
feehouse is open every Wednesday
evening and is sponsored jointly
by the YWCA, YMCA and the For-
eign Student Office. .

According to Tom Huff, direc-
tor of Pitt’s_ YMCA, “Many for-
eign students are unable to meet
Americans through normal chan-
nels. The coffeehouse provides a
low key opportunity to make new
friendships and practice English.”

This will be the third year of

operation for the coffeehouse. The
same site is used for the Crumb-

ling Wall Coffeehouse during the

weekends. Unlike the Crumbling
Wall, the Friendship Coffeehouse
does not aim to provide a platform
for fledgling entertainers: rather
it aims to be a basis for new
friendships. -

Of the approximately 40 stu-
dents who attend an average ses-
sion in the past, two-thirds were

from other nations. During some
of these meetings students from
nations at war met and socialized
at the same table.

Students come from many areas
including Pakistan, India, Saudi
Arabia, Israel, China, Japan and
Latin America. Huff said that
English and Canadian students
are usually readily absorbed into
the student body.

Coordinators for the project in-
clude Barb Khalil. Mary Ann Luty
and Gary Lowe. Pitt‘s Foreign
Student Advisor.

All students. foreign and Amer-
ican. who are interested in ex-
panding their horizons while mak-
ing new friends are welcome to
attend.

Duggan’s Office °Unprofessional’

by HARRIS MILLER

State Representative Leonard
Martino (D.-Shadyside), victor in
the Democratic primary race last
May for District Attorney of Alle-
gheny County,’ characterized the

’ present operation of the District

Attorney’s office" as "unprofes-
sional" in an exclusive interview
with the Pitt News.

The second term state legisla-
tor took to task the incumbent DA,
Republican Robert Duggan, who
will be his opponent in the Nov. 2
election, for not bringing any ex-
pertise to the County office.

Martino, a graduate of George-
town ‘Law School and an experi-
enced trial lawyer, also charged
Duggan with failing to cope with
crime in the County. “Mr. Duggan
arrests a couple of young people
for having one marijuana cigar-
ette and then uses the sensation-
alism surrounding the arrest to
show he is against drugs," con-
tended Martino, "but he still al-
lows the hard narcotics pushers

Martino also chastised Duggan
for attempting to close down sev-
eral local theaters and for the well

publicized attack on three pro- -

minent local physicians last year
surrounding the issue of abor-
tions. “This is an example of the
District Attorney attempting to

‘inject his own moral thinking into
our legal system,” stated Mar-
' tino.

The challenger accused Duggan

of other inadequacies. "Mr. Dug--

gan should have gotten involved in
the ‘witness fee scandal‘ case,"
Martino argued. He went on to say
that the incumbents lack of in-
terest in a case such as this cre-
ates a “credibility gap“ between

citizens and elected officials.

Martino also criticized Duggan
for failing to reform the bail bond

Angela Davis will have been in jail exactly one year Oct. 11
unless the people of this country demand her bail.

She is in jail primarily because as a Black Communist she
exposed the horrible conditions in this country, particularly in
the prisons. She was refused bail on June 15 by Judge Arnason in
spite of the completely favorable report from the Marin County
Probation officer who recommended bail for Miss Davis. ‘

Angela Davis has been “legally” victimiz-
ed by our jury‘ system. The grand jurors in A ‘
her case were selected from among friends
of five Marin County judges. Three of these
judges admitted to being members of the the
racially restrictive Fraternal Organization
of Elks. It is quite clear that in this way An-
gela Davis cannot have a fair trial.

An important‘ point to remember in her
case was stated in the Peoples’ Petition De-  ~
manding Bail for Angela Davis which said, ANGElA DAVIS
‘We contrast the treatment of Lt. William Calley who walks in
virtual freedom after being tried and convicted of the murder of
22 Vietnamese women, men, and children; Miss Davis, a Black
woman, a member of the Communist party, a consistent fighter
for the freedom of all political prisoners is unjustly denied bail.

Angela Davis is charged with supplying guns to Jonathan
Jackson, who, frustrated over the persecution of his brother,
tried to liberate the three prisoners and in the attempt was killed.
Two of the prisoners and a judge were also killed in this attempt.

There is no evidence to prove that Miss Davis knew in ad-
vance of Jonathan Jackson’s action or that she in any way helped
him carry it out. Her purchase of the guns had been open and
legal, done in fear of attempts on her life.

Clearly. allthis proves that she is on trial for her political be-
liefs and it is up to us to make sure she gets a fair trial. -

Recent events at Attica State Prison and San Quentin, with
the murder of George Jackson, have proven that our penal sys-
tem was devised with the cruelest intentions of suppressing peo-
ple who seek change in this country.

George Jackson, a fighter for ‘freedom, tried to eliminate ra-
cism from the prisons. For this “crime,” he was murdered.

The rebels at Attica were seeking adequate living conditions
and the right to political freedom. These were demands that our
government punished by mass slaughter.

/All these events point to the fact that our systemis repress-

 

It‘s a whole, fun world of pseu-
do-reality awaiting you, unless you
strike it lucky and catch a fine

ror trip, or John and Yoko acting

Cavett‘s talkie.

There were five singing dogs on
Johnny Carson last week. The big-
gest thrillthough, was when the

strained for the chance to get at
each other’s jugular veins.

Ah, yes, the young generation
is just a 'nuther bunch of escap-
ists, drowning its sorrows in Rip-

though; it’s an ego-building ex-

Several yards away a large
group of students was providing
an answer to the question. They
were playing football on the wet
grass between the Cathedral and
Heinz Chapel and turned the area
into a mudhole that will last well
into next spring.

This game ‘could have better
taken place on the practice field,

In further explaining Allegheny
County’s probable emergence as
a :leader in registration percen-
tages for those under 21, ~Isler
said that no other county or Board
of Elections, to his knowledge,
took this initiative. “Therefore,”
he added, “it is almost certain
that we will have the record state-
wide and nationality.

prised of people who would very
likely have registered in any
event.Thompson stated that the
rally boosted the percentages but
was by no means the dominant
factor behind the large registra-
tion. ‘

Isler echoed Thompson‘s opin-
ion and added, "The 2,740 reg-
istered at the rally was certainly
attributive and large for one day.

could be quite costly and might

Both Smith and Gainan agree
that Katsur can operate the lot at
a lower rate than can the Uni-

control of ‘the lot in December

Instead of merely telling us
there has been a plague, Russell

feels obliged to drapea putrifyingy

has great fun depicting the King's

When he finally opts for the for-
mer. Russell again overreaches
his grasp. focusing too minutely
on the instruments and actuality
of the priests torture, rather than
on the ignorance that has caused
it and the conflict in Grandier’s
mind. .

We are forced to witness Gran-
dier’s torture and burning, physi-
cally sickening shots that, through
the mesmeric effect of blood and
gore, further dilute the impor-
tance of Grandier’s murder.

' Characters are undeveloped and

Reed's thoughtfulportrayal of the

sionally visible through the din, is
generally lost in carnage.

The Devils could have been a
solid if unoriginal film. Director
Russell, however. has shattered
the pristine beauty of an honest
mans suffering with a barrage of
distracting detail. '

'éDCﬁIlit€l)I Nothing Exciting’

“Together? /[sexuality Abounds I

by non BONN

In a rare move. the theater man-
ager stepped to the stage and ex-
plained what the film was going
to be about. ,

"Usually. an X-rated film
means smut." he asserted. trying
to convince the audience that this
one would be completely differ-
ent. ‘

Film Reviews,

"Some months ago.” he contin-

ued, "a_ young man named Sean.

Cunningham sought” to produce a
film on the relationship between
man and woman, a film which
would be both graphic and real-
istic."

The result of the search is To-

gether, which premiered at the

Shadyside Theater Wednesday af-
ter two free “sneak-previews.”

The film centers around the.

work of Dr. Curry, a psychologist
who helps young people find true
meaning in this sexually-permis-
sive society. So he brings a lot of
young people of both sexes to his
26-acre estate in the country, and

there he teaches them the real

sexuality with some muscular-

 03°

 

meaning of giving. the real mean-
ing of caring. the proper attitude
towards touch and feeling and
response.

Potentially, it’s a situation that
would make for either a very

' touching ‘analysis of love or else

a great blue"-movie, but it falls
down on both counts.

Realistically, Together says
nothing about the man-woman re-
lationship except that sex is a
part of it, and that giving should
be part of sex. Great, huh? Very
profound.

But certainly there's more than
just technique and open sexual
feelings in a good relationship.
And even though these may be im-
portant, you'd think in an entire
movie that producer Cunningham
could have found some other fac-
ets of male-female relations to
include as well.

But more importantly, Together
will be an extreme disappoint-

ment to those who wish to_see

some good, lurid sex scenes. Al-
though the film abounds with love-
ly blondes running nude through

the woods, or skinny-dipping, or-

toplessly discussing the beauty of

.“_

 

looking beach boys, the presenta-
tion is practically asexual.
There’s definitely nothing excit-
ing about it. '

In fact, the whole affair left
this critic so cold that when he
left, he couldn’t care less if he
never saw another breast again;

There is a myriad of other cri-
ticisms that comes.to mind when
watching Together. For example,
Cunningham apparently thinks
the female is beautiful and de-
serves lots of nude footage, but
the male body rates only a,.quick
shot or two in the whole film.

In short, there is absolutely
nothin that could recommend
this film. Together would not'ap-
peal to the most sentimental aged
parent or to the horniest young
person. '

by MARTY HELLMAN
Associate Sports Editor

With a one year old revenge on their minds, the Mountaineers of

West Virginia will try to settle an account from last year's battle with »

the Pitt Panthers tomorrow afternoon in Morgantown, W. Va.
An expected overflow crowd of approximately 37,000 people will

. jam tiny Mountaineer Stadium for the 1:30 kickoff. The game will mark '

the 64th meeting between the two rival teams, with the Panthers way out

in front in the all-time series.
WVU Publicity Director Dick
Polen readily admits that the
Mountaineers are psyched for re-
venge over last years 36-35 Pitt

victory.

“It’s been kind of quiet until
this week, but as game time ap-
proaches everyone is going to be
raising hell,” he proclaimed.

So far this season, the Moun-
taineers have been erratic in their
performances. The offense, which
swamped Boston College in their
opener, could produce only three

-touchdowns in its last two games

with California and Richmond.

WVU’s top running threat is
senior Pete Wood, a 5-8, 190 pound
speedster. Against BC, he was in

top form as he gained over 200.

yards. His totals now stand at 314
yards in 61 carries, with four
touchdowns to his credit.

Though Wood is acknowledged
as the Mounties’ best runner, the
Panther defense will have to be
alert for sophomore ‘Kerry Mar-
bury, a former sprint champion
in West Virginia. Despite a slow
start, Marbury surpassed 200
yards in rushing at the Richmond
contest.

According to Polen, the Moun-

taineer receivers have not been

teaming up well with quarterback
Bernie Galiffa recently.

“They’ve been dropping passes

‘ that could have meant a few more

scores,” he said. "It’s just a mat-
ter of timing. ’

.Galiffa’s prime receivers are
Harry (Snake) Blake, Nate Steph-
ens, and Chris Potts.

Although ,__WVU Coach Bobby
Bowden retained the services of
only three defensive starters, the
Mountie defense has been the sur-

prise of the team. They have not .

permitted a touchdown in the past
six quarters of play.

Bowden admits that, "Our de-
fense will again have to play su-
perb to beat Pitt."

For the first time since Bowden
arrived at WVU, he has restrict-
ed this week’s practice session to
just the members of his squad.
Polen stated that “he’s trying to
insert new things for Pitt.”

Bowden will be fortunate enough
to have the entire compliment of
Mountaineers ready’ for game
time, as none is injured.

Pitt Coach Carl DePasqu'a does
not enjoy the same luck. as sever-
al key Panthers are either out of
the lineup or questionable for the
game. .

Offense guard’ Dan Lynn,
plagued with ankle problems, will
miss the clash. Les Block, who
leads the receiving corps with two
TD’s, is doubtful for the game,
because of his injured shoulder.

Defensive back Lloyd Rodgers
may also not see action because of
a, leg injury, while flanker Jim
Parros will be hindered by a brok-
en nose, suffered on a kickoff re‘-
turn against Oklahoma.

After missing the Sooner game,
offensive guardand team captain
John Simpson will be dressed and
ready to go tomorrow.

Dave Havern, the senior quar-
terback who set the all-time Pitt
passing record last week, has
drawn the starting nod from De-
Pasqua this week. He leads the
Panther quarterbacking trio in
total passing yardage with 151,
three more than John Hogan.

Havern is definitely starting,”
stated DePasqua, “but they all
have done the job well so far.”

DePasqua plans on readjusting

the defense to certain key spots

after the unit has yielded over 80
points in the first two games.

Offensive tackle (and guard at
times) Ernie Webster summed up
his feelings about the game by
"predicting that “we’ll beat them
again, only we won’t have to come
from behind this year.’.’

i“Pitt should beat us 8-0" is the way C-MU soccer coach Marc
Krotee predicts the outcome of tomorrow’s game between Pitt and
C-MU at 1:30 p.m. at Tartan Stadium.

“I don’t have anyone who could make the Pitt starting team," adds
Krotee who is in his fifth year of coaching. Krotee also played as an
undergrad at West Chester in the early sixties and recalls “bouncing
Pitt players around pretty good in those days.”

Judging from last week’s bitter defeat to the Rams, which left four .

Pitt kickers injured, West Chester hasn’t changed their style of play.
The four injured booters are fullback Jerry Kruth who will not play.

halfback Tony Nicholakoupolos,
who has a groin injury but will
dress, back Denny Kohlmyer,
who is on crutches and will not
play, and forward John White who
reinjured his leg but will start as
usual on offense.

Taking Kruth’s place on de-
fense will be freshman Dave
Thomas, while Denny Kohlmyer’s
gap in the lineup will be filled by
junior Len Raffa. Thomas will be
doing double duty as he will also
play with the Junior Varsity in
their morning contest against Du-
quesne at the Stadium, scheduled
for 10:30 a.m.

Thus the starting lineup for Pitt
will probably see Thomas, Gary
l\_/lidock, Fernando Carriquiry and
Mike Pincus at fullback; Len Raf-

fa. ,and*Gus .>Theofilos~,'at halfback, I

 

  

and Bill Rex, Joe Luxbacher, John
White and Chu Cho Valencia at the
forward slots. The goalie will
again be Steve Fibel.

With a lineup such as this it is
little wonder Coach Krotee of
C-MU gives his team little chance.

“It’s surprising that they lost to
West Chester with all the talent
they (Pitt) have. I’m Pitt’s ‘num-
ber one rooter despite the fact
that I went to West Chester and
was sorry to see them lose as it
greatly dampens their chances of
going to the nationals this year,”
states the candid‘ Krotee.

He pointed out that in order to
make the nationals Pitt will prob-
ably have to beat all their remain-
_ing opponents which include such

;.%nati,onal,'powers as Akron-,5 -Clevefgi

land, and their perrenial nemesis,
Penn State. Last year, Pitt lost to
all three of these teams as well
as Bucknell. As a result of these
loses Pitt missed the nationals.

Pitt soccer coach Leo Bemis
felt that Krotee has overesti-
mated us on purpose so that “he
could claim a big upset victory if
they beat us.” Bemis noted that
C-MU beat Pitt the first time, 2-1,

 Running conditions at Flagstaff
- Hill in Schenley Park were not the
best, the temperature was up-
wards of 80 degrees, but the Pitt
‘ Cross country team had a perfect
day nonetheless as they handily

topscore of 15-50.

The score, even though it does-
not seem that impressive, is the
best score that can be attained in
cross country. To achieve it,
" coach Jim Banners athletes took
1-the first eight places and ten of
the first 12 places.

_ Dave Szabat, John Black, Bob
 .Schurko, Mickey Collins, and
, Dave Chesebrough all crossed the

_finish line simutaneously with a
time of 34.32. They were follow-
ed closely by Mike Scurko. Ken
Silay and Richard Markly for the
top eight places. - I»
, Szabat and Chesebaorough’s per-
 formance was not totally unex-
,' pected as they are veteran har-
riers. Black’s performance was a
, pleasing one to Banner.

“John has been bothered with
, injuries every year, but he really
came through," said Banner.

 Schurko and Collins saw their
first varsity action for the Ban-

. ' nermen as they are both freshmen
 and both champion high school
runners.

defeated Cleveland State by the ‘

 

age10—”THE PITT ’NEWSI—-Frid'a"y,' Octoberl, P1971 '

 Harriers Perform Perfectly

Actually the winning time was .

deceiving. Earlier in the prac-
tice sessions, Banner had stated
that a good time for the Schenley
Park course was under 31 min-
utes. Because the race was such
a runaway, the second three miles
were not run all that strenuously.

“We planned to run all out the
first half of the race,“ continued
Banner. “The first half of the
course is the hilly part. One hill in
itself is a mile long. In spite, they
had a 15.33 time for that half. The
second part of the race became
unimportant." ~

While the competition was be-
ing supplied by the harriers them-
selves, Banner still managed to
learn a little bit about the runners.

“I though the younger fellows
were a little afraid of the course,”
he said, “but they are young and
are a good group. They will pro-
vide good competition.”

Being that Cleveland State had
already defeated two earlier op-
ponents, Banner was very satis-
fied with the teams performance
and feels that they will get better
still.

How much better than perfect
can you get‘? -

.third place finish in the North-
eastern division.”

With only two more races left
in the season does the squad think
they'll make it‘?

“Yes," confidently stated Sue
Powell, the administrative head
of the Camaro crew.

“We’re better organized and
we have to make it,” she added.

Being the first road racing team
in the nation competing with pro-
fessionals, the students who have
done the work feel very personal
towards the organization.

“At the race I’d be looking for
the Blue and Gold car but I‘d see
the red—white-and-blue and have
-no feeling for it," stated 3'-:lV;s
Gooch. “It's just our car and it

I_doesn‘t matter if it is a different

color, it’s our car."

Ms Powell mentioned that the
suspension on the new car from
Greenwood “doesn’t have as good
a suspension system as our orig-
inal ’69,‘Camar'o. But once he

(driver Bob Fryer) gets the feel ..

of the car he’ll be able to take
firsts instead of seconds.

Fryer will get the chance _to get
a real good feel for the car on the
Indianapolis track.

- “A friend of mine drove a Vette
there," Linda continued. “He said
that it was ‘a real good smooth

. asphalt track, possibly the best in

the East.”

JV Booters Battle Dukes

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

The Pitt junior varsity booters
will lack a little “punch“ when
they go after the Duquesne Dukes
in their first soccer match of the
‘71 season tomorrow at 10:30 a.m.
atPitt Stadium. ’

Right winger Bobby Hull re-
ceived a slight concussion in a
scrimmage with‘ the Pitt varsity
when he collided with,fullback

‘Jerry,Kruth. At present. the- doc-

tors are not certain if Hull will
be able to play tomorrow.

"We'll definitely miss Hull,“

"related Panther JV soccer_ coach

Dick Slutzky. “He has speed and_
scoring punch."

Filling the position vacated by
Hull will be George Hull who is
regularly the goalie for the boot-
ers.

Slutzky feels Hull will do a good.
job at right wing because “George
is highly competiti.ve‘and, since
he is normally a goalie. he has a
good kick.“ * 4

The soccermen will go with a
four fullback set-up and_ in all
probability the starters willvbe

Dave Thomas. Jerry Luxbacher.

"The Panther coachlstated that
he would go to a three-halfback,

fullbacks didn’t work out.

Thomas and halfback Larry
Skalski will see double duty to-

to have graduated t'rom Canon-McMillan High School’. as did Stan Os-

Although Stan was one of the
leading rushers on the 1970 Cub
squad. he has been used very
spayingly this season in playing

ried the pigskin only six times in
the two contests already played.

gaining a total of 13 yards.

When questioned as to why Judy
chose to attend WVU after he had
already decided to accept a Pitt
football scholarship, Ostrowski
grimaced and replied, “We just
had to get away from each other.”
