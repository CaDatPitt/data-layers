For many Pitt students, their
four years here are spent whin-
ing. There’s always too much of
one thing or not enough of
another.

But some students stop com-
plaining and do something about
it -— they get involved with the
Student Government Board.

- “There is always something to
do,” said board member Paul
Ufberg. “We can always use
people, and everyone is wel-
cor:,.= We want people to stop in
at meetings and talk to people.
Don’t be afraid to talk to board
members about your concerns
— that’s what we’re here for.”

According to the SGB’s con-
stitution, its purpose is “to pro-
mote the concerns, interests,
needs and welfare of the non-
CGS, undergraduate student
body.” ‘ '

The SGB consists of a presi-
dent, eight board members and
nine committees. The board
members are elected by students
and work to bring together
administration, faculty and the
student body. A

Each board member finds a
particular committee that inter-
ests him or her. Then the presi-
dent and that board member
agree on the member becoming
the liaison for that committee.

There are two types of com-

Ridership low on loop buses

PAT bus driver Bill Yearsley has been driving the 64U and 74U shuttles. The shuttle sys-
tem is in danger of being canceled because of low ridership.

By Kathleen Scanlon
News Editor

Sometimes when boarding one of the crowded
61-route PAT buses to go to Squirrel Hill, David
Hoffman hears the driver ask, “why don’t you
take the 64U?”

Hoffman, a Pitt grad student and experienced
shuttle-rider, has an answer.

“[The 64U] is either never here or it takes too
long to leave,” he said. ‘

The 64U and 74U loop buses, which run from
campus to Squirrel Hill and Shadyside, are usually
nearly empty,-while buses that pass by campus
and go on to downtown have been coming in full.
If the low ridership on the loop buses continues,

routes may disappear after the end of this school
year, said John Morgan, Pitt assistant director of
parking and transportation.

‘There’s not a danger they would be dropped
during the demo period, but if they’re not used
after the demo period, how are we going to justify
keeping them out there?” Morgan said.

The demonstration period lasts for one year.
Morgan said he thinks many students just don’t
know about the loop buses yet.

“People are picking up the schedule that talks
about the PAT general schedule,” he said. The
loop buses, the 64U to Squirrel Hill and the 74U
to Shadyside, have separate schedules.

PAT buses have replaced shuttles going to and

Yo-yo dieting not harmful

By Lisa McClendon
For The Pitt News

Have you heard that yo-
yo dieting may cause
health problems? Have
your doctors warned you
time and time again about
the dangers of weight
cycling?

A studygrecently com-
pleted and published in the
July 10 issue of the
Archives of Internal
Medicine says differently.

Yo-yo dieting, or weight
cycling, has no adverse
effect on four important
cardiovascular risk factors,
according to a study con-
ducted at Pitt and the
University of Minnesota.

“We found that four
indices of cardiovascular
health — lipid levels,

blood pressure, waist-to-
hip ratio and percent body
fat —— showed no increase
in individuals who lost
weight and regained it
compared with those who
maintained their weight
over the course of the
study,” said the principle
investigator of the study,
Rena R. Wing. “This
means if you lose weight
and gain it back, you will
not increase your cardio-
vascular risk factors above
and beyond what they
were originally.”

In the study, 148 partici-
pants who initially were at
least 30 to 70 pounds over
ideal body weight were
encouraged to lose weight
over a 30-month period.
The study was prospective,
weight loss among partici-

pants was voluntary and
the participants were all
moderately overweight.

“Our research confirmed
findings of other studies
showing that losing weight
and keeping it off will
decrease cardiovascular
risk factors overall,” she
said.

“Even modest weight
losses of 10 pounds will
produce decreases in car-
diovascular risk factors.”

Debbie Luffey, a dietit-
ian at the Student Health
Services, said it is impor-
tant to balance the impor-
tance of dieting with good
nutrition. She said that the
study results have some
positive implications as far
as cardiovascular disease.

Pitt and NASA
protect firefighters

By Julian Neiser
Senior Staﬂ" Writer

A collaboration between NASA and the
Pittsburgh Fire Bureau could bring lifesaving
space technology into the hands of local fire-
ﬁghters.

On Monday, the two groups formalized their
relationship by signing a memo which allows
the city to use federally funded space research
for ﬁre-ﬁghting equipment.

The recent deaths of five local ﬁrefighters
prompted Pitt’s Mid-Atlantic Technology
Applications Center to establish an equipment
and idea exchange between NASA and the
bureau. This exchange will provide a flow of
cutting-edge technology to the city.

“There’s every reason to believe that some of
the proposed equipment could have saved the
ﬁremen who were trapped and died last 
said Fire Bureau Chief Charlie Dickinson.

Last February, three local ﬁreﬁghters died

PARIS — Swiss bankers
said on Tuesday they dis-

belong to Holocaust victims.
But the World Jewish

say this is only a fraction of

Eastern Europe and may
have been stashed in Nazis’

SARAJEVO — The most
recent NATO , air raid
destroyed six Bosnian Serb
military targets on Tuesday,
turning one ammunition
dump into an inferno.

Vogosca, the ammunition
complex on the northern

bombed by NATO jets
around 2 a.m. A U.N. offi-
cial said alliance jets were
targeting ammunition
dumps, storage sites, strate-
gic bridges, and command
and control posts around
Sarajevo and in eastern
Bosnia.

"The NATO raids are an

WASHINGTON — The
tobacco industry has donat-
ed more than $1.5 million to
the national Republican
Party treasury in the first
half of 1995. This is more
than five times the amount it
has given in the past.
Critics of the tobacco
industry said the flood of
donations is an attempt to
get the Republican leaders
to intervene on the strict
regulations Washington has
put on the tobacco industry.
These restrictions include

I limiting cigarette advertise-

ments and requiring warn-

ings on cigarette packages.
The industry is also worried
about the Food and Drug

_Administration, which is

moving to have nicotine
declared an addictive drug.
The industry also fears the
proposed new limits on the
sale of cigarettes to young
people

Joseph S. Helewicz, a
spokesman for Brown and
Williamson, said his compa-
ny’s donations were made
because the company sup-
ports Republican ideology.

WASHINGTON — The
Central Intelligence Agency
will continue covert opera-

critics in Congress who
question the agency’s tac-

Director John M. Deutch
said espionage is “the core

Intelligence Agency.”
Recently, members of
Congress have wondered if
the benefits of secret infor-
mation are worth the risks of
recruiting murderous and
corrupt foreign agents.

“If we do not take such
risks because we are afraid
to fail or we are afraid of
controversy, then we will
fail as an intelligence ser-
vice,” Deutch said. “We will
continue to need to work

Buses

°From page 1

from Squirrel Hill and Shadyside since May. Unlike the
shuttles of last year, these buses also go downtown and
pick up those who don’t go to Pitt, although if you’re lid-
ing past Oakland you must pay the normal fare. But the
loop buses, which follow routes only to and from cam-
pus and also run through the two neighborhoods, were
just instituted in August .

Some students say they prefer taking the regular PAT
buses rather than the loop buses. They are usually more
crowded, but they seem to run more frequently, to some
students.

‘“1“here’s three different 61s,” Hoffman said. “They’re
always around more quickly than [the 64].” ‘

The loop buses run about every 20 minutes to half an

hour, while a 61 bus comes by about every 15 minutes.
But the loop routes beat any individual PAT route in fre-
quency by one stop, Morgan said.

And the routes are about the same within the conﬁnes
of the campus area. The loop buses leave from the
\V1lliam Pitt Union and retum to the union. 1 '

There’s one difference. When the buses stop at catn-
pus, “the 61C is crowded, and the 64U  comes in
empty,” Morgan said. The highest ridership on a 64U so
far has been 15, he said.

Those who take the loop buses also have the advan-
tage of riding with mostly Pitt students, Morgan said.

Corey Shouse, a grad student, takes the 64U about as
much as he takes a 61 bus, depending on whichever one
comes‘ ﬁrst to pick him up. He said overall the service

has been convenient for him, but “the only problem is. in
the morning, [the 61] is crowded.” Many on the bus

‘ aren’t students, he said.

Morgan said the loop routes were instituted just for
Pitt students. “Why not ride a bus that’s more dedicated
to the Pitt students than the standard route that every-
body rides?” -

Originally, the parking and transportation department
slated the ﬂexible buses for the loop routes, anticipating
more student usage, Morgan said. The ﬂexibles can seat
about 30 more people than the regulars. But so far the
ﬂexibles have not been needed. ‘

PAT and Pitt will review ridership on the loop buses
throughout the year before making a decision about
whether to drop them. I

sors and grading polices. Each
semester, it administers teach-
ing evaluations to instructors
who request them.

This evaluation seeks to find
out what students expected
from the class before and after
they took it, why they took it
and their general impressions of
the instructor who taught it. The
results from these evaluations
are published in the “Student
Course Evaluation Guide” that
comes out in the spring.

The duty of the Allocations
Committee is to decide how
much each student group should
receive of the student activity
fee.

The Community Relations
Committee is the only commit-
tee to be chaired by a board
member. Started last spring by
Jane Berger, its purpose is to
unite the campus. It communi-
cates to the student body
through the SGBrief. The
SGBrief can be found monthly
in The Pitt News and now on
the World Wide Web. at:
"http://www.pitt.edu/~sgb/".

Currently, this committee is
working on the Pittsburgh

The Elections Committee
handles the process of electing a
board and president every
November. It sponsors the
Presidential Debate and Meet

Attendance for the
Presidential Debate, Meet the
Candidates and the election is
generally poor. Voter turnout is
approximately 10 percent of the
student body, a number that
board member Jane Berger

Many of the current board

Interested freshmen can become

The Governmental Relations
Committee is responsible for

J A Byrd in the hand...

The suits in Washington are up to their old tricks again.
Senator Robert Byrd from nearby West Virginia is the ring
leader.in this circus that calls for journalists to disclose all
sources of any income they make outside their main profes-‘
sion.

Byrd has called for non-binding legislation in the Senate
that will, in effect, ban any journalists from covering the
Senate unless they come forward with who paid them how
much for speeches and other functions.

Apparently, Byrd is upset that TV journalists like Cokie

g Roberts and Barbara Walters are getting hefty (around

$30,000) fees to speak at high school graduations.
Maybe Byrd and his cohorts on Capitol Hill should go use

3 some of their leftover PAC money, buy a dictionary and look

up capitalism. They will find words like “private” and “eco-
nomics” in that definition. And while they’re at it, an
American policy and law book might not be a bad idea either.

The Supreme Court heard an issue similar to this years ago.

0 The Court determined then that an organization was not

required to furnish a list of its members, since this might lead

lish lists of their members, and private citizens should not be
required to publish lists of organizations to which they speak.

power in aiprohibitory way in order to dictate behavior or
action. Democracy and capitalism are basically contradictory
to the concept of requiring journalists to register their
actions. Just as Congress cannot use its taxation power to
punish people, it should not be able to use its lawmaking
power to regulate people’s private lives.

Byrd is ﬂyingoff the handle because he is required to pro-
vide a list of those people and groups who contribute money
to his campaign. What he forgets is that he is a politician — a
public figure. When he made the choice to -become a servant
of the people, he sacrificed his privacy. Journalists have done
no such thing. Though they are public figures, they do not
serve the public in any way except to provide information.

Finally, a person’s income records, tax forms, W-4’s,
1040s, etc. are private. It is against the law to look at another
person’s financial records without consent or without a court-
issued subpoena. Journalists are already required to claim the
money they receive from speaking appearances, so what dif-
ference does it make who paid it to them? ’ i

If a high school wants to shell out $30,000 so Cokie can

a grace its commencement stage, that is its capitalistic right.
And if private-citizen Cokie wants to take the money, it is her .

dards relating to their work. They have an obligation to pro-

Politics as usual

It seems that Vice President
Al Gore is not as astute at proto-
col as he is at political potshots.
When he visited here, he failed
to invite the Army ROTC and
Air Force ROTC commanders.

I They are the ranking officers

here on our campus. Yes, the
Navy was present, but all com-
manding ofﬁcers, regardless of
theirebranch of the military,
should have been formally invit-
ed, as well as the cadets. From
what I remember, the campus is
to the ROTC program as a garri-
son is to the active armed
forces. That’s akin to Gore
showing up at Ft. Hood, Texas,
and only inviting the ranking
Air Force officer there and
snubbing the post commander,
an Army officer. Is there any-
thing that these people can do
correctly in regards to the rrLili—
tary of this nation? Budget cuts.
hell, how about some respect?

John J. Klazon IV
CAS 1997

Once again, studentiapathy is
running wildon campus. I have
no idea why Pitt students would
want more student aid. If any-
thing should be done at all,
restructuring and/or making cuts
should be it. '

First of all, student aid pro-
motes laziness. I have seen stu-
dents sucking up aid while tak-
ing 12 or 15 credits per term.
Many aid recipients are in
expensive extracurricular activi-
ties, such as fraternities.
Furthermore, aid should be
allowed for four years only.

4 Students who can’t make up

their minds as to what major to
study'shouldn’t be in college.
Our society has dictated in
recent years that the only way to
make money or to be somebody
is to go to college. This is
absurd. It also results in a lot of
students leaving college with an
enormous debt due to financial
aid, with a low grade average, in
an overpopulatedarea of study;
What could/should be done?
More restrictions should be put

on students that receive
loans/student aid. Changing
majors should not beallowed
while receiving aid, and mini-
mum grade averages should be

implemented. We,‘ the student.

body, are here to be educated.

One ﬁnal note directed to Al
Gore: rather than looking for
ways to keep the budget plump
with unneeded monies,
shouldn’t you be looking for
alternative means of cutting the
budget? By ridding the system
of freeloaders, we can free up
more money from the same or
less allotment, for the more
needy students.

I am writing to express my
concern about an attempt to
suppress the free expression of
ideas here at Pitt. While I was
pleased to learn of Al Gore’s
visit to speak about financial
aid, I was wary that this might
be another attempt to gain votes
by supporting a popular issue 
Environmentalists well remem-
ber Gore’s 1992 campaign
promise to prevent the opening
of W.T.I., the world’s largest
toxic waste incinerator, located
in East Liverpool, Ohio  The
list of objections to W.T.I. is a
mile long, but  the facility has
finally been allowed to burn
toxic chemicals Gore
promised not to allow W.T.I. to
operate until a full investigation
had been completed, but then
backed down from this promise
once in office. Naturally, many
of us have doubts as to the trust-
worthiness of our vice-presi-
dent.

On the day of Gore’s appear-
ance, many protestors attended
to remind Gore of his promise.
We arrived with nothing other
than information leaflets and
signs that were not physically
different in any way than the
signs that the SGB had prepared
for the event. and in no way
obscene or threatening.

However, we were told that our

signs were not permitted in the ‘

special guest area (for which we
all had passes) because they
were ostensibly not about the
issue at hand, financial aid.
Thus, our signs, as opposed to
the “official” SGB signs, posed
a “security risk.” I was not
aware that signs of a different
subject matterthan what SGB
wanted to express at this public
event could comprise a security
risk "to our vice president.
Perhaps being confronted with
his lie is bad for his blood pres-
sure? -

;.. If the powers that be feel
that they have to keep the vice
president happy by eliminating
anything that might blight his
media image, they should con-
sider if this image is worth pro-
tecting at the expense of the
First Amendment, ignoring the
right of the people to assemble
peacefully and to express their
message freely.

_ e upon another
college football weekend,
and the Pitt Panthers are
looking to go 3-0 as they
travel to Texas. The
Panthers will face the 15th-
ranked ‘Longhorns Saturday
in a regionally televised
game on ABC at 3:30 p.m.

Pitt.(2-O) is fresh off a 66-
30 rout of Eastern Michigan,
the first time Pitt reached 60
points since 1984. The
Longhorns (1-0) were idle
last week after a 138-17 win’
over Hawaii in their opener.

Coming into the game,

points, but the Panthers are .
definitely on cloud nine

after a 2-0 ‘start. The
Panthers’ back-to-back wins
against Washington State

and EMU are the team’s first
since 1991. That year the
Panthers started 5-0 before
dropping five of their final

- six games to finish 6-5.
Last season the Longhorns ,

went 8-4 and capped the .
season with a 35-31 win

Sun Bowl, while Pitt fin-
ished an unimpressive 3-8
for the second straight year.
The odds are stacked
against Pitt in this one.
Since 1991, the Longhorns _

I are 4-0 in games following a ‘

week off. More bad news for
Majors and the Panthers
comes in the form of history.
The Panthers have never

years of competitive foot-

Before the Panther fans
lose all hope, let’s roll the

' tape.

cornerback, is back after
missing most of last season-

Injuries, to key personnel will

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor

This Saturday, when the Pitt Panthers travel to Texas to
play the No. 15-ranked Longhorns, the running back position
will onceagain raise aconcern for fans and coaches.

Vince Williams, who scored two touchdowns and rushed
for 47 yards last week against Eastern Michigan, has been
listed as doubtful due to an ankle injury suffered during the
week.

health is questionable going into Saturday’s game at Texas.

By Matt Grove
Staﬂ'Writer_

As we all know, comedian
Rodney Dangerfield gets no
respect. He does his job, and he
does it rather well, right?
Freshman Chris Ferencik under-

stands the plight of_ Dangerﬁeld; .

he is a place-kicker.
Place-kickers are usually the
littlest guys on the field. They
have only the single-barred Joe
Theisman facemask. They don’t

‘practice like the rest of the team.

They kick ﬁeld goals and extra
points, and then practice is over.

This is not true for the
Panthers’ starting kicker.

“I know where they are com-
ing from when they give me a
hard time, because we [kickers]
don’t do that much in terms of
physical work at practice.

Mentally, though, it is really’

demanding,” said Ferencik. “l
have learned to take it with a
grain of salt and just do my
thing.” ’

For a kicker, Ferencik is rela- .

tively big. At 5-foot-10, 175

pounds, he has the strengththat

complements the accuracy to

make a‘ successful kicker. But

when Pitt camp opened in
Jolmstown in mid-August, things
did not go as plaimed

The Panthers opened practice

with an array of kickers. Ferencik
was joined by Todd Barton,
Steve Kalmanides and Chris
Burnett. Coach Johnny Majors

looks to carry more of a load. Last week against the
EMU Eagles, Beasley rushed the pigskin six times for

Patton rushed 12 times for 53 yards, but with‘ his
blocking abilities and the emergence of Harris, look
for Patton to play a few downs at fullback. '

I mean, he is tough. The job was

In his fust game in a Pitt uni-
fonn, Ferencik was put to the test
early. His ﬁrst task: a 41-yard FG.

Mission accomplished.

“I thought that when it came
time for the games that I would
be nervous, but the way that
coach Majors runs things makes

you ready for anything. I’m glad’

that I was ready,” Ferencik said.
Ferencik feels that Majors is

tough on the players, but that

only means that he wants them to

get better. ‘

“Majors is a great coach,
probably the best I’ve ever had,”
Ferencik said. “He got on me at
first because he knew I wasn’t
playing the .way I could. I
remember in a scrimmage when
he told me that an All-American
would make this field goal and
that. if I was the All—American
everyone thought I was that I bet-
ter make it Stuff like that makes
the games feel like nothing.”

Coaching has always been
helpful for Ferencik in all that he
has done. Russ Jaques, his coach
at Strongsville High School in
Strongsville, Ohio, helped Chris
get where he istoday.

“Coach Jaques was awe-
some,” Ferencik said. “Before
coaching our team, he was on the
staff at a lot of big schools. He
has been here [Pitt],
Northwestern, West Virginia,
Bowling Green and Wisconsin,
so he knew a lot of people. When
recruiting began, he told the
coaches what he thought of me,
and they respected his opinion.”

Advantage: Push

Linebackers— David

at OLB after playing three
seasons in the secondary. ‘
This 6-foot-2, 205-pound »
senior started all 11 games ' I
last year and has seven tack-
les in two games so far this
season. . ’

Reed, a 6-2, 240-pounder,

year for Texas. He missed
the Louisville and TCU
games with an injured arch,
while a hyperextended arm
forced him out of action for
the SMU and Texas Tech
contests."

This is another close _
matchup, but if Tom
Tumulty can come back for
the Panthers, they get the
edge. Advantage: Pitt

Defensive Line— Jared
Miller vs. Tony Brackens

Miller is in his second sea-
son on Pitt’s defensive line,
after spending all of the
1993 ‘season atoffensive
guard. This 6-3, 245—pound
junior possesses a mixture
of size and_quickness which
is vital’ to the position of
defensive end. _ _‘

‘Texas counters at end with

Tony Brackens. At 6-4, 250,
Brackens has been an
imposing figure since his V
freshman year. As a fresh-
man, he was named the
Southwest Conference
Defensive Newcomer of the
Year by The Associated
Press. 3

Miller has a tough act to
follow. Brackens is too
strong-,to look past.
Advantage: Texas

On’ the offensive side of

the ball, both the Panthers

and Longhorns are extreme-
ly versatile. Pitt racked up
648 total yards last week -—
315 rushing and 333 through

points before giving way to

Ryan has been on fire so
far in the Panthers’ first two

for 288 yards and three _
scores with no interceptions.

two quarters of play.

Gonzalez came in for Ryan

Dame, Rutgers and Syracuse, but he decided
to come to Pitt because he felt he could come
in and play. .

“The big schools go out and look at about
25 kickers out of high school. They make up
their list of two or three, and they travel out to
see them play,” Ferencik said. “It so happened
that I was that second or third person on their
lists, and they signed someone else. I.hope to
be able to play them and show them that they
passed up a good player.”

Ferencik does not feel that Pitt is second- '
rate at all. He understands that not everyone 5

can be the best; the point is to go out and do
your best — all the time.

As a freshman, he not only has to worry
about football, getting adjusted to college life
is a huge wall to climb. '

“High school is nothing like college at all,”

_ Ferenciksaid. “High school did not really pre-

pare me for college life. It is a totally different

world here. When you are on scholarship, you _

are expected to do a job. It is not about having
fun, because now money is involved.
Basically, you’re getting paid to do ajo .” . _

Still only 17 years old, Ferencik is grow-
ing up in a huny. In the classroom he has yet
to decide on his major, but he has startedto
build the foundation for a good education. “A
free education,” he stressed. '

“When Pitt offered me a full scholarship, I
got exactlywhat I wanted,” Ferencik said.
“They put their faith in me; I am their invest-
ment. Ifl fail out of school, what good am I to
the team? They believed that I had the ability,
but having the ability and proving it are two
different things.” 5 I

Academically, many students face a heavy
workload, and to put hours of practice, meet-
ings and ﬁlms on top of that is asldng a lot.
Ferencik has not escaped the feelings of
despair when a paper is due or a test looms.

“I complained a lot at ﬁrst when the work
got heavy. I especially complainedto my
dad,” Ferencik said. “He did not take any of
my whining, though. He told me the same
thing that he told me when I got hurt. ‘Don’t
feel sony for yourself. Suck it up and just get
back out there and do it. Don’t complain,
because nobody else will do it for you.’ My
dad has helped me a lot so far.”

As Pitt has placed its faith in him, Ferencik
has also put his faith in the team, a team for
which he holds the highest regards, even
though he is still only in his ﬁrst year.

“I have not been around long enough, but I
do see a strong desire to win from all these
guys,” Ferencik said. “They show up to play,
and they show up to win. They make that
very clear.”

When asked about the pressurethat he

must face, this calm young man did not bat an
eye. The scenario of being put in a game-win-
ning situation did not phase him at all.

“I think that pressure is an overrated
word,” Ferencik said. “Sometimes my prob-
lem is conﬁdence, but I try to go out there and
do my thing. Ifl hit it solid, it will go in.”

At the start of high school, Ferencik
played both offense and defense at wide
receiver and defensive back, respectively.
After attending a Matt Stover Kicking Camp
his freshman year, he began to focus on place-
kicking. During his sophomore year he went
down with a leg injury, and from that point on

"it was strictly kicking.

. Ferencik is grateful for having the ability
to kick and having been given the oppommity

to come to school on a scholarship.

“Ifl wasn’t here on scholarship, I do not
think I would be playing football anymore,”
Ferencik said. “They have given me very

good opportunity, and I do not want to let '

them down.”

So far on the season, he  been a perfect
2-2 on ﬁeld goals and 11-11 on extra points.
The pressure will get hotter as the season
wears on, but he has shown that he can take
the heat ’

All eyes will be on this youngster when ‘

thebig game comes, and, most likely, he will
deliver. I “

ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISM 3

SOCIAL SERVICES

Pitt is too experienced for ’
the Longhorns, but the ques-
tion marks in the Pitt sec-

9 ondary may come into play.

Advantage: Push _

Running backs-
Demetrius Harris vs. Ricky
Williams

Two true freshmen will be
the feature backs in the game
Saturday at Memorial
Stadium. Harris stole the
show last week, rushing for
149 yards on only 11 carries.
Harris exploded for a 55-
yard TD, one of three on the
day, during the 31-point O
Panther second quarter.

Texas has its own explo-
sive frosh as well. Ricky
Williams surprised the
Hawaii defense for 95 yards
on 10 carries. Williams also
scored twice in the win. But
remember, that was the
Hawaii defense.

With Patton and Schneider
opening the holes, the
Panthers get the edge in this
one. Advantage: Pitt

Receivers— Dietrich Jells
vs. Mike Adams

In the opening game of the
year, Jells became the all-
time leading receiver in Pitt
history. He came back the
following week to record
134 yards and two touch-
downs on only four catches,
including a 66-yard bomb
for a TD from John Ryan.

Mike Adams caught five
balls for 98 yards and scored
once against Hawaii. “The ’

Playmaker’’ said his dream is i

to win the Heisman one day.
It does not look too good for
the junior out of Arlington.
Texas, as of now. A

My ballot favors Jells in
this one. Plus, you cannot
vote against Sadiq Durham
— ever. Advantage: Pitt

The 11-point spread seems
to me to be a little gracious
for Texas. The Panthers are
on fire, while the Longhorns"
have been away from action
for two weeks. Place your
bets, because Pitt is going
into the Ohio State show-
down in two weeks at 3-0.
Pitt 27 -Texas 24.

Reel film culture will _never,
ever be televised. Ever. The
revolution will not be seen on
the commercial big-screen. It
will not be screened in the dark
cineplexes ofAmerica. It will
not be seen in the pseudo-
indie venues littering most
metropolitan villages. It will not
be shown on PBS. And it can-
not be found on the museum
circuit. A quick look down the
indie, art-house pipe will reveal
less hip, less cutting—edge,
less revolutionary cinema and
more of the same star-system
schlock that ideologues criti-
cize Hollywood for producing
(see Kevin Smith’s Clerks,
QT’s star-flavored cameos in
umpteen mainstream flicks,
Crumb and The Brothers
McMuIIen, etc.).

One of the best films l’ve
seen so far this year, Sonic

Outlaws, was not released by

Miramax, Paramount or a
Warner Bros. subsidiary; nor
did Pittsburgh’s other sup-
posed art—house type screen-
ing venues (the Warhol
Museum, the Rex, Pittsburgh
Filmmakers and the Carnegie
MOA) rope in the San
Francisco-based film-barsciit
Craig Baldwin, Sonic ijiutiaw
director. Celluloidphiles, how-
ever, were not to despair when
the Orgone Cinema 
Mike Johnsen, Alisa Dix and
Greg Pierce, brought both
director and film to the Sliver
Eye Theater one sv_»>;>1i‘e~'iz‘sg
evening last June. Eire; 
post-mod pastiche-
Negativland doc,

Outlaws, explores the retation
between U.S. copyright Saws
and artistic license, framing the

re ‘
J‘!-gﬁ 4"n1
C~«_.’::."i..—-

film with the idea that collage-

is a veritable forum for critique
and deconstruction of main-
stream mass media.

Orgone Cinema specializes
in film programs that won't be
found anywhere else in
Pittsburgh, presenting shows
up-close and personal, minus
the academic doublespeak of
the museum circuit. Johnsen,
Pierce and Dix began pro-
gramming at Orgone two years
ago and have brought experi-
mental filmmaking luminaries,
such as Austrian avant-garde
legend Kurt Kren, documen-
tary filmmaker Jacob Young,
bondage guru M. M. Serra,

and other underground giants

such as Henry Hills, Saul
Levine, Anne Robertson,
“tENTATIVELY, a
cONVEN|ENCE,” Fred
Worden and many others.

“lt’s not a part of the general
consciousness of the youth
today, or even the educated

 

classes, that they’re going to
see films that are strictly non-
commercial or non-narrative,”
Johnsen said; “even though
they’d go out and see
Whitehouse or the Boredoms,
or some free jazz show.” Youth
culture is art culture is film cul-
ture. Orgone Cinema fills the
void thatwould interrupt such
a maxim, and as members
explain, Orgone co-exists with
such contemporary organiza-
tions as Basement Films in
Albuquerque, Mansion Theater
in Baltimore and many others
that run in the same vein as
San Francisco experimental

co-ops, which were the stomp- A

ing grounds for non-commer-
cial filmmakers George

~ Kuchar, James Broughton and

Kenneth Anger in the ‘50s and
‘60s. Orgone is simultaneously
entertainment and education,
revolution and film evolution,
whose tradition dates back to
European cinematheques
(where film is not primarily a
commercial art-form --
Hollywood is Europe’s main-
stream also).

Orgone is active in raising
film cultureawareness within
Pittsburgh, all the while wear-
ing a punk—rock, garage-rock
ethos and ideology. Where
else you gonna eat Spam,
possibly Graham Crackers,
and then discuss with Ken
Jacobs the finer points of light-

ing, shadow-play and projec-

tion circumstances? Huh? Tell
me where? Johnsen said, “The
Carnegie never took it upon
itself to bring in young people.
In order to get a show at the.
Carnegie, you had to be more
established. Which is typical of
a museum - they're not going
to bring in some risky whipper-

 

I a grant

1 “non-commercial”

snapper.” Providing an alterna-
tive to the stuffy, academic
framework many film programs
are shown and received is, in
part, how Orgone operates. .
While Orgone is particularly
serious about its programming,
Dix said, it won't provide pro-
gram notes or allude to any-
thing that could impose a droll,
possibly monolithic fiIm-read-
ing on the audience. “What
most film programming does is
insist on imposing this textual
template that tells everyone
what to think before they see
anything." Afterwards, viewers
can expect a healthy discus-
sion of the film’s historical
background that may help to

contextualize the program, but

it’s an informed give-and-take
discourse between both audi-
ence and filmmaker. It's never
a lopsided, academic lecture.
A friend of Orgone members

I who joined us in our interview,

Sarah, drew an indie-rock par-
allel to what Orgone is doing
with the moving picture.
Orgone is a not-for-profit orga-
nization that gets little press
and whose members’ peers
get little press. Johnsensaid
Orgone operates entirely from
it has from the
Pennsylvania Council for the

V Arts, its own pockets and the

admissions fees collected at
the door of each show. But
unlike the indie scene, or any
music
scene, experimental film sim-
ply is not a part of a larger
industry the way music oper-
ates. Johnsen puts it more
succinctly: indie-rock ideo-
logues “are violently opposed,
to buying anything that Warner
Brothers puts out on record,
but if Warner Brothers puts it

  

  
  

out on film, they are somehow
going to go watch it  You
wouldn’t ask them about the
new Counting Crows record,
but they’ll go see the
Hollywood equivalent of that
and be completely non-critical
of it.”

Orgone cinema was original-
ly founded two-and-a-half
years ago with Jeff Armstrong,
who has since left town for
Chicago. Armstrong, Johnsen
and Pierce met while working
at Pittsburgh Filmmakers, with
Dix joining up following
Armstrong’s departure. The
name Orgone comes ‘from the
theories of cultural outlaw and
psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich.
Orgonomy and Reich’s orgasm
theory come from the idea that
as sexual energy builds up in
the body, it needs release
through orgasm. If the natural
release of sexual energy is
repressed in any way, the
repression can give way to all
kinds of neurotic mechanisms.
Reich’s orgasm theory privi-
leges orgasm as the release of
repression, and the re-estab-
Iishment of the natural flow of
sexual energy eliminates the
neurosis. '

American film culture, and
culture at large, is surely
repressed. Orgone’|I make you
sweat! The programs are a
white-hot orgy of celluloid, par-
ticularly when you get an
evening with~M. M. Serra or
the porn opus Thundercrack.
Sarah explains the food-buying
for that program: “We had
sticky—sweet caramel corn. We
wanted everybody licking their
fingers.”

Pierce and Dix, who are now
married, and Johnsen like their
artists they way they like their

7 G

   
 

  

art: up-close nd personal.
That’s why they encourage all

visiting filmmakers to spend.

some time in our city, crash at
their apartments, or at least
stay up late one night and talk.
“You stay with us, and you see
the city in a different way, and
you kind of get a different feel
for what's going on here,"
Pierce said. Kurt Kren stayed

for nine days - watching all-

their movies. He picked up
everything he could get his
hands on, Pierce said.
Johnsen said he began to

compile a list of how many ‘

movies they watch_ed when
Kren stayed with them. “It was
like 60 or 80,” he laughed.
“He’|l devour any film, recent
experimental stuff, horror films,
Peter Jackson. Anything  I

remember waking up in this 1

daze at 3 a.m. after watching
some Katherine Bigalow thing,
and I looked over at him,
crouching down on his little
body, leaning into the VCR,
and he says, ‘Shall ve put in
Hel/raiser /I/?”’

Admission to all Orgone
events at the Silver Eye, 1015
E. Carson St., is $3.»Next
Saturday, Sept. 23, Orgone
will begin its third season with
a show in which improvisation-
al musicians John Berndt, Jack
Wright and Todd Whitman will
provide the sound for Johnsen,
Dix and Pierce’s own films.
Local jazz artists Watershed
will conclude the show. On
Oct. 14, Orgone will bring
Boston—turned-New York film-
maker Luther Price to the
Silver Eye, and a special
guest, possibly Ken Jacobs,
will make an appearance in
November.

Don ablleo I
Don Cabellero 2
Touch and Go

Well, there’s a lot of buzz
about this one. I heard com-
ments like, “|t’s great, but I
won't listen to it as much  it
doesn’t‘rock out,” and I've
read in the Post-Gazette that
this is the best album Touch
and G0 has put out in years
(paraphrased Dave Martin
quote). What is the real low-
down?

I’ll take Martin’s stance:
Don Cabellero 2 is one hell of
a (double) album. is it a big
departure from For Respect?
Well, yes and no. The new
record still packs a mammoth
punch, but one noticeable dif-
ference is the guitar interplay.

I recently spoke with Ian
Williams, one half of the Don
Cab guitar team.

“On the first record, I was
pretty new to the band. Mike
[Bamfieldj showed me the
songs, and we basically
played in unison on much of

 
  
  

   Elscoon-con non cabauero  

 
   

it. On the new record, we both
wrote songs and had time to

" develop the songwriting as a

group,” he said.

This is what "makes the
record brilliant. The two gui-
tarists play off each other
amazingly well, creating a

 

wide array of sonic textures.
A song like “Cold Knees (In
April)” evokes the polyrhyth-
mic style of African dry guitar,
while “Stupid Puma” hits you
with larger-than-life riffs,

doesn’t come to mind when
discussing the driving motiva-

that incorporate deep-seated
aspects of theatre, music,
dance, movement and that
inimitable phenomenon called
performance art. The perfor-

expertly crafts a multimedia

Living Dead that combines the
best of the aforementioned
elements of performance.
Equity actress Kate Aronson,
lead singer of the group, starts
the show by sauntering out on
stage and mimicking the
actions of the main character
of the film, Barbara. While the
film is being shown on a back-
drop behind the stage, the
players arise out of the wood-
work akin to the ghastly dead

with some creative move-
ment/performance sequences,
compose a show that would
engage even the most tradi-
tional spectator. '

The story of the Night of The

~ Living Dead is fairly simple:

Cannibals rise from the dead
after a woman (Barbara) and a
man (Tom) visit a cemetery.
Barbara is a little scared of
cemeteries at first, and Tom
compounds her fear by teasing
her with those famous words
“They’re gonna get you,
they’re gonna get you!” By that
time, BLAM! All hell breaks
loose, and ghouls and walking
dead people are tearing up the
place. Also, Barbara happens
to stumble into an abandoned
house and a few other people
show up and throw Molotov
cocktails and argue about
where to hide from the Living
Dead. .As anadded bonus,
Western Pennsylvania geogra-
phy and a load of kitschy bad
acting are thrown in just for
fun.

it would take a considerable
amount of talent to turn canni-
balistic ghouls and kitschy bad
acting into a vehicle for quality
performance. But, considering
the skills and artistic scope of
Squonk Opera, I haven’t seen
anyone more qualified. Pitt
Theatre grad and local perfor-
mance artist Dan Barnhill con-
tributed his choreography skills
to the project, and boy does it
show! Barnhill’s skills are
rather distinct, especially in an
i m ‘p r e s s i v e
movement/sound/music
sequence.that involved the
whole company. Dempsey
started the progression with
short, clipped circular move-
ments that ended in the rhyth- ..
mic dropping of wood. As she
repeated this action‘ again and
again, Berheiser easily
stepped into the rhythm with
his own man-made noises.
Then Aronson entered her
auditory contribution and let
Kornici-<5 and O’Hearn lead the
group with a percussion and
Sa:-ic‘.-;.:~§‘l~’.3.?1e music/sound exhi-
bitéon Zhat filled the audience
with pure amazement.

Amazing is a word that
comes to mind when describ-
ing most of the scenes in the
show. The abounding comedy
is a part of the performance _
that  duly noted by this
reviewer. One scene in partic-
ular occurred at a time when
the rswen of the abandoned
house go‘; together and argued
about where everyone should
hide. All the men of the com-

The Usual Suspects

Directed by Bryan Singer

Wit_h Gabriel Byrne, Kevin
Spacey, Stephen Baldwin,
Kevin Pollack and Chazz
Palminteri

The Usual Suspects. is Bryan
Singer’s first big-budget
endeavor, and it would fair
much better if_it weren't trying
so hard to look like it wasn’t.
He attempts to create the

. image of a low-budget inde-
pendent film, but instead ends
up with a cheap imitation, and
the aesthetic inevitably betrays
his big budget.

He sets the film up as a no-
frills, suspense thriller, much
like Tarantino’s Reservoir
Dogs. The difference is that

 

Tarantino was able to pull off
the raw, nonlinear story line
and senseless violence in a
big-budget production, see PF.
Singer falls short, because the
low-budget mirage he tries to
paint over the film isn't enough
to hide the Hollywood conven-
tions that bite The Usual
Suspects.

The film tells the story of five
known con men (played by
Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey,
Stephen Baldwin, Kevin
Pollack and Benicio -Del Toro),
hand-picked by the New York
City police to stand in a lineup.
Just as the police, and the
audience, predict, the five set
up a plan to do a job together.
Only this time their aim is to
get even with the cops. After

by breaking ope a ring of cor-
rupt cops and making off with

‘L ' a fortune in jewels, the five

take off to California, where
they have more in store for
them than they had bargained
for. They fall right into a web
weaved by the most feared fig-
ure of the underground, the
Hungarian mobster Keyser
Soze?‘

Soze is pulling all the strings,
turning the five into his pup-
pets, without ever showing his
face. He is the boogeyman
whose name is enough to
‘send shocks of terror down the
spines of all-who know his
story. The question is whether
Soze is real or just a ghost-
story front used by someone
with less power to get what he
wants. ' E

The story unfolds during an
interrogation of Roger “Verbal”
Kint (Spacey), the sole sur-
vivor of the group of five after
an assignment commissioned

 

by Soze. The whole story is
told in a flashback form
designed to build suspense.
but actually does a better job
of confusing the audience to
the point of annoyance.

If Singer had fallen-only to
the urge of jumping on the
indie-wagon, we might have
been able to forgive him. But
then he throws in a love story
to fulfill the romantic compo-
nent demanded by the
Hollywood film industry. Dean
Keaton (Byrne) is the con in
the bunch who, after a lifetime
of crime, had decided to go
straight and fell in love with, of
all people, the district attorney.
But of course, back in the
slammer, he gets the itch for a
good, old-fashioned heist and
gives in to peer pressure.
References to Keaton’s love-
torn state dropped in through-
out the film are so outof place
you might think they were acci-
dentally spliced. in from a

   STUDENT“

    

whole other film. Not only that,
but Singer has McManus
(Baldwin), the tough-guy of the
group, getting sentimental and
homesick when things start to
get rough — a moment so out
of character you have to won-
der ‘what Singer was thinking.
The one thing that saves this
film is Spacey’s performance
of Verbal, the crippled con.
Verbal’s knack of storytelling
verges on the annoying, but

leaves you laughing and
charmed at the same time. It's \

his performance that makes
the surprise ending work.
Singer intends to lead the
audience down an intriguing,
twisted road of suspense, but
winds up getting it lost in a
maze ofconfusion.
The Usual Suspects is show-
ing at the Squirrel Hill Theater.

September 14, 195

 

“You were smart enough to
stop reading Seventeen at
fourteen, Glamour at fifteen,
and Cosmo at sixteen.” -The
Official Slacker Handbook,
Sarah Dunn '

So what do you read now?
Every month hundreds, if not
thousands, of people you’ll
never know struggle to put out

their own self-published maga-

zines. Most of these maga-
zines are read by a couple
hundred people at most, and
are soon forgotten. These
magazines are often called
fzines,’ and usually have
rougher production values
(due to limited budgets, many
zines are photocopied) and
more personal articles than
what you're used to seeing on
the newsstand.

I love zines. Since content is
limited only by the writers’
imagination you can read
about topics that you will never
hear of in mainstream media.
Sometimes when l’m reading a
zine I feel like I’m reading a
personal letter from a friend,
as opposed to reading the
endless string of corporate

plugs that most magazines are _

these days.

“John these zines, as you
call them, they sound so mar-
velous. But how can I get
these wondrous things?”

Dear friends, I am glad that
you asked. Unfortunately, you
must often actively seek out
zines. I get most of my zines
by mail, although Eide’s down-
town (address, Penn Ave.)
carry some of the more popu-
lar zines. Many zines are also
available through the much-
touted information highway. A
great source book for zines is
a publication calledBook Your
Own Fuckin Life! This comes
out yearly and contains a
state-by-state and country-by-
'country listing of zines, as well
as bands, promoters, record
labels, etc. Most of the zines in
it are less than a dollar, and
many of them are free by mail
for a stamp or two, so you
don’t have a lot to lose. |t’s
available for $3 by mail from:
Bleeding Heart collective/ 4728
Spruce St./Box 354/
Philadelphia, PA 19139. Eide’s
may also have some copies
left. Those of you into fine print
may have noticed that is out of
Philly this year, which means
that the listing for the Philly
area is really comprehensive,
as is the listing for
Pennsylvania in general.

Maximum Flock n’ Floll is one
of the longest running and
most consistent zines. I’m not

Septembe14,1995

 

reviewing any- individual
issues, because there’s no real
difference in quality from one
issue to the next. There’s
always a lot of band inter-
views, and long-time readers
like these as much as the
columnists. There’s usually
about fifteen or so in each
issue, and it takes a couple of
days to read them all. I almost
always laugh uncontrollably at
least once reading them (and

_ the way things seem to go for

me, it’s in a public place full of
people who stare in horror).
There’s also pages upon
pages of zine ‘and record
reviews. This zine is the thick-
est monthly publication I've
ever seen in my life. The
pages aren’t numbered, but
there’s probably about 200 of
them. Copies are $3 each by
mail at PO Box 460760/San
Francisco, CA 94146-0760.
You can also buy it at Eide’s
for a dollar less.

If anyone has any comments
or wants to know more, e-mail
me at: jmcst25 @pitt.edu. P.S. I
still read Cosmo on occasion.

them either. We don’t worry
about-it, and don’t care about
the skepticism.”

Some of the songs are long
by conventional pop stan-
dards, but what makes these
different is that there is a
development of them or sonic
developments of a repeated
theme that makes them inter-
esting and exciting to listen to.
This is not the kind of monoto-
nous repetition you find in
Spacemen 3 (who are great)
or the self-indulgent 20-minute
solo-a-thons you find with
Magic Hour (also great).
“There are no solos,” said
Williams, “and this is not jazz
 the CD assures you of that.
There’s no improvization.” But
like jazz, the songs do not
appear static. Due to superb
songwriting, ideas and sounds

evolve into other ideas and ‘

sounds and possibly sound
like improvizations.

Some of the album will be
familiar to fans of the Don's
live shows. “We've been play-
ing many of these songs for a
while now in our live perfor-
mances  ‘Stupid Puma,’
‘P,P,Pantless,’ ‘Repeat

Defender” informed Williams. ,

The record works because the
songs sound good live. All of
the songs are highly Iistenable,
can be reproduced in front of
an audience and translate into
entertainment. This is not
some avant-garde conceptual
aibum — it’s a rock album.

Albeit, a rocklalbum with some ‘

brains and diversity!

But there are a few tricks
that would make John Cage
grin, in particular, the drum-
ming on “pleas tokio, pleas
THIS IS TOKlO." Damon Che
not only beats the hell out of
his kit, he saws it with a table
saw! Well, he only successfully
saws a cymbal; you can hear
the thing break while he
attempts the snare. This might
sound like a gimmick, but it
sounds really cool. The cymbal
starts to sing, and the saw rips
it in half.

Williams added, “The saw
part ‘was not in our original
plans. Originally, we were
going to explode Damon’s
drum set piece by piece with
m-80's or other explosives.
Damon would wear a special
protective suit, but the engi-
neers refused.” Regardless,
the playing is all-around explo-
sive. Matt Jencik, of Hurl fame,
does a great job with the bass,
and, expectedly, Che’s drum-
ming is second to none. The
dual guitar assault knocks you
out — this time with a few new
punches.

Don Cabellero 2 is in stores
on Sept. 19. Buy it. Enjoy it.
