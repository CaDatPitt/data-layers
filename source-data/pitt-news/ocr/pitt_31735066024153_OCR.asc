Pitt Stands to Receive $36 Million

By SCOT STONE

The Pitt News start Writer

 

Pitt may receive 'a $36 million
Christmas gift from the state in the
form of a capital funding bill
passed by the House and Senate in

Harrisburg, which is presently
awaiting Gov. Dick Thornburg’s
signature.

According to Earl Gohl, legisla-
tive assistant to Sen. James
Romanelli, the legislation, House
Bill 2920, originated in the House
but it was Romanelli who went to
the Appropriations Committee and
asked for inclusion of additional
projects including the Pitt money.

“There are three projects for-
Pitt mentioned in the House Bill,”
said Dennis McManus, assistant
director of government relations at
Pitt, “the renovation of Salk Hall
for the School of. Dental Medicine,
The Bradford Campus Library and
Administration Building, ' and the
Medical Research facility near
Scaife Hall.”

According 'to McMannus, the
universtiy submits a priority list of
projects to the legislature for
consideration when a capital
funding bill is being considered.

John Yeager, deputy senior vice
chancellor for administration, said

that both the Dental School and the
Medical Research Facility were on
the top of the list, but that the
Bradford project was listed ninth.

“That’s because it was a request
from a regional campus,” ’Yeager
said. “The third project on our list .
was for multi-purpose uses.”

According to Ghol, the bill was
put before the governor on Nov. 20,
and that he has thirty days to deal
with it. He can either let it pass into
law without his signature, veto it,
or veto certain speciﬁc items.

.“My guess is that, the_ whole
thing will be passed, although
certain projects that the governor
did not speciﬁcally ask for may be

cut out," Ghol said.

According to Kirk Wilson, press
aide to the governor, the governor
has been out of the country and has
not seen the bill yet.

“It’s. too early to tell what is
going to be cut, or how he (the
governor) will deal with it,” Wilson
said. ~

V Gohl believes that the governor
will pass the entire bill since it
achieved such wide support in the

‘legislature. The bill passed the

Senate by 49 to one. . —

«Christmas Gift from State Legislature

The entire budget for the bill is
$380 million, and includes funding
for a variety of projects for other
state schools, penal institutions,
and pfﬁce buildings. The money,
not inlcuded in the state’s general

fund, is raised through bond
issues.
‘ ‘This sort of thing is not

uncommon for us. We've comp-“
leted a lot of projects, especially
since the 1960's, with state
money,” McManus said.

It is difﬁcult to predict just how
soon money will become available
once the bill is passed. Once the
bonds are ﬂoated, there is the
planning for the various projects
for which it is allocated. According
to Yeager, the time lag between
allocation and the actual construc-
tion of a facility like the Medical
Research project is between 12 and
18 months,

“This money.is not exactly a
gift.” McManus said, “not only is
it necessary for the maintenance of
a certain level of quality to which
we are committed, but we also
provide valuable services to the
community in the form of highly-
trained professionals. The Dental
School isa good cas_e‘in point._”

By CHRIS CLINTON

The Pitt News Staff Writer

a young woman from rape and

yesteraday was awarded for his

heroics by Pitt’s Department of

At approximately 1:45, Bogden,
who has been with PAT for
fourteen years, was driving up
Belleﬁeld when he heard a woman
screaming. As he approached
Tennyson and Fifth, he noticed two
ﬁgures “engaged in a violent
struggle.” Bogden saw a man
dragginga woman behind the bus
shelter in front of Clapp Hall and
he stopped his bus to "investigate.

l“I stood on the steps of the bus,

things.

I wanted to make certain

that everything was okay.” Bogden
said. '
Bogden yelled, “What the hell
are you doing‘ over there?” The
man answered, “This is ’my
girlfriend leave us alone.”

“The girl screamed, “please
help me, please help me” then I.
left the b_us'and the guy ran away,”

_ Bogden recalled.

Bogden waited until the woman,
a student from Carlow College, was
safely on his bus and then called
the Campus police

    

The” police arrived less than a,
minute_ later "according to Bogden
and - began the search for the
suspect. Moses said he noticed a
car parkedon Tennyson and “felt
suspicious about it." Within ten
minutes of hisarrival, the suspect
emerged and headed towards the
parked car.

“The bus driver gave us an
excellent description of the man
and when I saw him, I knew who it

it’s time once again for The Pitt News annual
Thanksgiving editorial where we praise what we feel
we should be thankful for and criticize what we
shouldn’t be so thankful for. What follows is a
term’s worth of both good and bad items so, first the

laurels, then the darts:

Fifth Avenue——after the last steamshovel has

finally left, Fifth Ave-. has appeared as quite an

achievement in road reconstruction for Pittsburgh.

Although many a motorist was heard to remark

earlier thisyear that Fifth Ave. was no better to drive

on than a Texas cow path, the new asphalt and

clearly marked lanes have hopefully pleased the’
majority of these motorists.

Fraternity regulations—the new fraternity
regulations allowing only one open party per term
and shortening the open rush period to two weeks at
the beginning of each semester iscertainly something
to.be‘thankful for. Not only can we be thankful for a
more harmonious relationship between our frater-
nities and the surrounding community, but we can
also be thankful for a_reduction in the amount of
damage done to our fraternity. houses. I

The Panther Football Team—without a doubt, the

Panthers have proven themselves another champion
in the City of Champions, and for all Pitt football
enthusiasts we can be very thankful for Jackie

is

Trocano and all the other fine athletes who pride
themselves as Pitt Panthers. Although the final. act of
a dramatic season won’t take place until Saturday in
Beaver Stadium where the Pantherswill take on arch
rival Penn State, we can still be thankful for the work

stage. .
WPGH Radio FM Proposal—the “proposal to
establish an FM radio station at Pitt finally passed
through the red tape of the university administration
earlier this summer, and for this we can be thankful.
It took months of prodding and politicking to con-
vince the Student Government Board and the univer-
sity’s senior administration that an FM facility would
be well worth the capital investment.

The Black Action Society and Pitt’s Affirmative
Action Program——TH_E BAS under the leadership of
Mona Riscoe and Drew Walker has been one ofthe
finest student organizations on Pitt’s campus
through their effective and well-planned program-
ming for Pitt’s minority students. And the university
affirmative action program under the directorship of
Dr. Maryann Bishop-Coffey has done an excellent
job in their efforts to make sure Pitt complies with
federal affirmative action laws and includes women
and minorities in all phases of the university. But we
can be expecially thankful for the fact that Pitt views
its affirmative action policies not aslthe law but as a
necessary ingredient to making Pitt a fine university
for all qualified persons. 4 ‘

And then there’s always the bad things for which
we can’t be too thankful about: ‘

The Reverse. Bus Lane on Fifth Avenue—we can
understand the motives behind this move in that the
re-routed traffic off of heavily congested Forbes

V Avenue was a needed addition to the city-wide traffic«

program, but we can’t understand why it was such a
well-kept secret until ‘after the fact. We can be thank-
ful that the Pitt student hit by a PAT bus is in good
condition now, but we aren’t too-thankful for the
fact that she was hit in the first place. ‘

_ Tuition" Hikes—if the tuitiongoes up any higher at
this place, nobody will be able‘ to afford their

C Thanksgiving turkey, or any food for that matter.

Obviously, tuition hikes are necessary every once in a
while to keep up with inﬂation, but yearly tuition
hikes ‘have almost become a tradition here at Pitt.
The only thing we can be thankful for about tuition
hikes is having the money to keep up .with them.

Wednesday, November 26, 1980 »

Mervis’ Hall Moves—despite all the arguements

that moving the registrar and other offices to Mervis ‘

Hall was a particularly good move, from the amount
of criticism it has received——especially from those
most -affected: Pitt’s students—the move doesn’t
seem to have been such a wise decision. We can’t say
we’re too thankful for: lines which are just as long as

they were before in the bottom of the Cathedral; a__Vl,:i' . L
registration’ process just’ as screwed up as it was

before; and for relocating the offices in an obscure
location on the campus. '
Visitation Policy—picture this: you’ve just found

each other and it’s blossomed into..a fruitful,and_

meaningful relationship. So the two of you go to. the

Towers after 2 a.m. only to find out that-he/she can_’.t I

showers. The visitation policy scores—and "you Q;
don’t. We can only be thankful for the concerted ef- 
fort on the part of Pitt’s resident students who have '

vigorously opposed this policy.

The Pantherette hoopers have
solidly established that they are a
powerhouse team this year, in
search of the coveted Eastern title.
Pitt crushed a formidable oppo-
nent, Northern Kentucky, 106-72,
in its season debut. The victory
was an impressive one for head

 "coach Judy Saurer, in her first year

at the helm for Pitt.

scorer, was slapped with three
personal fouls before the first ten
minutes had elapsed.

Miklasevich was not the only
Pantherette hearing whistles.
though, as the team committed
seven fouls before the game was
ten minutes old, putting Northern
Kentucky into the one-and-one
situation early in the contest. On
the opposite side, the Norse-
women had accumulated just two
fouls in that same time span.

Sophomore forward Penny
Welsh turned the "momentum
around, bringing it to the Panther-

ettes’ side.

“Penny had some key steals and
rebounds for us in the early
going,” said Saurer.

With the defensive play of Welsh
sparking the squad, the offense
caught ﬁre. Pitt’s explosive 5-2
guard, Debbie Lewis, dissected the
Northern Kentucky defense, driv-
ing for 22 first-half-points.

‘.‘Our offense depends a lot on
Debbie’s ability to drive,” Saurer
said.

With the threat of Lewis

penetrating, the defense backed off

just a little bit to protect the lane".

This cued the Pantherette’s outside
shooters to let loose on the cords.

Lori Dolby, a transfer from
Edinboro State, and Welsh handled
this chore admirably. ‘ Dolby
pumped in eight points, and Welsh
16, giving the Pantherette attack an

The Panthers, however, have
some impressive stats also. Pitt is
the number one’ defense in the
land. both in rushing and total
defense(6l.3 and 200.3 yards per
game, respectively) and ninth
against the score, allowing only
11.2 points per game. ,

Offensively, Pitt has been
explosive and presently ranks
fourth in passing offense (280.9
yards per game), ninth in rota] I
offense (428.8 yards per game),
and seventh in scoring offense
(32.9 points per game).

“Pitt has got the best personnel

said Penn State coach Joe Paterno
via telephone hookup from State
Cojiege “They have a good football
player everywhere and an ex-
perienced football player every-
where. They can do so much to you
because they can make the big
plays offensively and defensively.”

The ‘Lion coach also seemed a
little upset about both Pitt and
Penn state being shut out of the
major bowls on New Year's Day.

-Potential, that often used term,

there were reasons for that,

Clancy, at 6-6, played center last

illness. Chipman has already
assured the press that Clancy
would see no action at center. '
In Ed Scheuerman and Paul
Brozovich, the Panthers have a

couple of big men whose perfor-
mances have not drawn raves from
critics. Scheuerman, the senior
from Baldwin, has not displayed
much of the promise that brought
him to Pitt in an injury-plagued
career.

' Brozovich, a sophomore, showed
some promise last year but his
knack for fouls kept him on the
bench for a lot of games. The two
will split time at center, and their
play can very well dictate the fate
of the Panthers. Backup will be
provided by ed Wallace, a redshirt
last year, and Steve Beatty, a
freshman from Slippery Rock who
is wtill developing.

Although he says otherwise,
Coach Chipman might very well
have to use lancy at center before
the season is over. -

The Pill News Siaffwriter
Last Sunday, the Pitt hockey
team beat Gannon 8-3. ‘Gannon
stayed within striking distance for
the first two periods, but lost big in
the third when Pitt scored four
consecutive goals. Pitt’s record
now stands at 3-].

Despite the high score, Pitt
coach Larry Newell was unhappy
with the quality of his team’s play.

“They werevskating randomly,”
Newell said. “They kept breaking
off the plays, the power play for
instance. It works well in practice
but it gets forced in the games. I
think it’s because they’re not
completly used to playing together
in the new line formations, but that
will come with time.”

Early in the first period, Gannon
made some well-coordinated drives
into Pitt ice, but Pitt fended them
off and returned to score the first
goal. Alex Sanchioli scored for Pitt
with an assist coming from Eric
Barkaskey and Cliff Ziegler.

' Gannon came back eight minutes
later with a goal by Chris Fama,
but before the period ended Pitt
regained its lead with a goal from
rookie Dave Forry. Forryv was
assisted by Andy Cherish and
Sanchioli.

Neverson, 6-5, is the ‘scorer and

even be deeper than that.
Neverson's spirited play truned
him into the ﬂoor leader and also
the Panthers most consistent
performer last year.

With a 12.8 point scoring
average, Neverson was the second-
leading scorerlast season. His true
importance, however, is his ability
to shut down the opposition’s top
guards.

Wallace, second in the assists in
the Eastern Eight last year, is back.
His play at point guard was so

, important to the club that ‘when -he

was injured, Pitt took a nosedive.

On the bench, there is reserve
talent. Darryl Gissendanner, Scott
Grevey, and John Ryan are the
returning lettermen. Of all three,
Gissendanner could get the most
playing time if he can harness some
of his quickness..

Charley Williams and Brett
Crawford are the two freshman
guards. Williams has already
impressed the coaches and he
could be the sleeper of the new

COPS

Written by Terry Curtis Fox
Directed by Robert Koch
Fine Line Theater Company
Soho Repertory Theatre

By GREG WILSON
Realism is the key that makes the Fine

Line's latest production, Cops, a virtual
knockout. It is a real-life, traumatic ex-

perience. that has the audience clenching

its fists, gritting its teeth, shaking with

excitement, and diving for the floor.

Imagine sitting amidst a raging gun
‘battle and shortly thereafter ‘feeling like a

physical showdown. A showdown bet-
ween the upholders of the law and a
crazed, hostage-holding criminal. While

participant in a hostile verbal_ and-

watching the confrontation intensely, a
sigh escapes you, having barely missed
being shot. This is the experience of
Cops, a truly "realistic" theatrical event.
The action is set in a decrepit ”greasy
spoon" located in a deteriorating
business section of Chicago. The owner,
waitress, and customers are engaged in
an unending battle to defeat their op-
pressive surroundings. The pain and toil

each character experiences in everyday -

life is depicted in each body movement
and each spoken word. -

The "cops" who come in" for meals are
bland, both personally and physically.
They appear relatively disinterested in
everything other than their duties. In ac-

tuality, if it were not for the harsh and
crude obscentities used by each cop, the
audience would most likely have fallen
asleep waiting for a conflict to arise.
Essentially, the story concerns men on
both sides of the law; men who believe
that pleasure is derived from and
measured by the amount of power and
control each can obtain. The greater the
potential to threaten violence, and the
ability to actually commit the violent ac-
tion, detennine the level of satisfaction

each man receives from life.
Director Robert Koch deserves a

healthy pat on the shoulder. His concep-’

tion and interpretation of the script, and
his timing,’ is the illuminating factor that
makes Cops a stand out. Koch's in-

fluence is projected in the fact that the
characters know their parts well enough
to make their actions believable and
justified. The characters are more than
pigeon-holed; they ,are alive. Koch has
avoided their falling into the all too
available and ineffectual stereotypes. He
presents the confrontations as if they
were happening now, fresh ‘ and
primitively violent. In other words, there,

are no imitations; “ this is "theatre of I

realism” in its purest form.

ENTRE NOUS: A CELEBRATION OF

By CATHIE MARUCCI

It is nearly futile for one such as myself
to pass a critical judgement on those who
are my idols. It seems as though
whatever mustering of criticism

 technique I manage to acquire—my ob-
,  servations will be slightly tainted. And
I" ‘. well they should be. These dancers are
 -not only true professionals in their art,

*   ture its survival.

"The ensemble grew out of our mutual

‘respect, friendship, and the desire to

remarked Ms. van Hame., "It gives all of
us a chance to work with younger

Belgian-bom van Hamel, "It's kind of
calming, when you get frustrated with

uninteresting or familiar repertory, to_

know that you can just go ahead and do
something new?’

Ms. van Hamel herself is a solid dan-
cer who is very consistent in style and
tech_nique. Dancing Two Solos from Five
Dances, The Dying Swan, and teaming
up with Kevin McKenzie for The
Sleeping Beauty-Act III Pas de Deux,
Ms. van Hamel projected her consistency
and love for the art.

Gary Chryst, on the other hand, (a'
principal dancer with the Joffrey Ballet '

for ten years, also a dancer for ‘Twyla
Tharp, Bob Fosse, and Kurt Weill) had
to be this reviewefs favorite. His com-
mand of the dance and iterpretive style
were well balanced making him a special

from Dancin'. The choreography was
true to the Fosse form; and Chryst
knows the combination to make it spring
to life.

However when he teamed with
Kristen Elliot (formerly with the Stutt-
gart Ballet now a member of ABT) in
the Pas de Deuxi from Gayne there
seemed to be a slight flaw. Elliot could
not match Chryst in stage presence or in
dynamic .impression. He overwhelmed
her and she tried to compensate by being
overly "cutesy.” She did however do
much better with Clark Tippet in_ Trio A
Dewi. Their styles complemented each
other and produced a crisp’. andwvery en-

‘\.

   
    

Mr. Tippet himself is one of America's
leading premiere danseurs. He is a prin-
cipal dancer with ABT and a permanent
guest artist with the Milwaukee Ballet.

‘His partners have included some
illustrious ballerinas such as Ms. van-

Hamel, Natalia Makarova, Cynthia
Gregory, Karen Kain, and Gelsey
Kirkland. \

The final number, which included the
entire cast, was the most unique and
creative of the eveningslrogram.

To Pitthugh Ce The i Kids From The Big Apple 

Biblogy 101 as it was so titled, was a

playful piece which derived itslfun from
the music of Duke Ellingon and assorted

traditional folk songs.

Except for the fact that the seating was

awful and taped music was sub-quality,

the performances truly.lived up to my
expectations. The dancers, bringing the
._ choreography to life, proved to the

audience that they were experiencing "A

celebration of dance."

'The Ties That Bind’ 30

By FRANK DIGIACOMO

Possessed. The word lingered in my mind 10 pm, Friday, Oct. 3 as I stood
mashed between two neanderthal men in the general vicinity of Gate One at
the Civic Arena. We were but three of a gigantic human sea that had all
come for a single purpose, and that purpose was on the lips, thoughts, t-
shirts, and portable cassette decks of everyone in that massive crowd. The
purpose was Bruce Springsteen.

Tickets were to go on sale at 10 am the next day for the Nov. 30 show.
People had started camping _on the Arena's grounds two days ago. At 10:30
pm there was a mad rush for the ticket windows—I was approximately
twentieth in a line that, by morning, would snake it way down the street for
five blocks. S

Two years ago, Bruce Springsteen could only fill small halls and theaters.
Today, "The Boss" can sell out single sports arenas and coliseums for a week
straight. Somewhere, within those two years a fire was kindled. A fire that
has grown with each song, each album, each performance, that has
propelled Springsteen into the highest ranks of superstardom.

Springsteen is the master of the song. Whether it be the no holds barred
rockers like "Rosalita" and "Ramrod," the fiery but tender love songs like
"Because The Night," or the stark reality of "factory" and "Independence
Day;" Springsteen paints an image of life that burns of truth. Pain, bitter-
ness, dead dreams, and dying love—they’re all there in every one of his
albums. Yet, these musical tales,of life's misfortunes are magically off-set by
songs of hopes and dreams that aren't dying a lower middle class death,

songs of love and triumph, and songs that simply rock-n-roll like no other.
The end result is albums that make the listener pose and swagger in front of
a mirror with a mock guitar knowing deep down with a secret satisfaction
that Springsteen sings it like it is. ,_

In concert, Springsteen is awesome. The stage is his kingdom and the
people his power source. Rolling Stone Magazine recently quoted
Spfngsteen, "The audience brings a lot, even when you think you have
not ting left within you. You know, tonight is tonight, and what you do
tonight, you don't make up for tomorrow, and you don't ride on what you
did last night. I always keep in my mind that you only have one chance.
Some guy bought this ticket, and there's a promise made between‘ the
musician and the audience. . .If you break the pact or take it too lightly,
nothing else makes sense. It's at the heart of everything." .

Springsteen no doubt lives by the "pact," as a ticket to a Bruce Springsteen '

concert is a guarantee to see one of the best concerts of one's life. On stage,
he's a human supernova, leaping onto speakers, pianos, drum sets, and into
the crowd. He plays guitar with abandon, sings with fire in his voice, and
mugs and poses with a sneering innocence. He's the class clown, the street-
wise gangleader in tight jeans, black boots, and white t-shirt that mothers
hate and girls secretly love. He's the realization of every rock-n-rollers’ fan-
tasy. ‘ .

There's nothing phony about Bruce Springsteen. ‘He's the poet and the
performer who gives his all—the rock-n—roller with no pretenses. That is
why on Sunday, November 30th and Monday, December 1st this pact shall
be fulfilled. ' i r

DIRE STRAITS
Cleveland agora__
Tuesday, November 18

By FRANK DIGIACOMO

There was a certain poetic justice to

the Muzak that blared through the sound
system three minutes before Dire Straits

the theme from High Plains Drifter, and
like its star, Clint Eastwood, the Straits
had silently stole into Cleveland to ‘per-
form with a renegade style and flawless
precision that sets them apart from every
other rock band. _ I .
As the band took the stage, lead
guitarist/ singer, Mark Knopfler, clad in
an ancient black sport coat, "Rockaway
Beach" t-shirt, black pants, and incan-

mike, flashed a, playful English smile,
and began toying‘ with a teasing string of
notes that picked up the rest of the band

Upon A Time In The West.” The Straits
then broke into a fast-moving "Expresso
Love” from their new album, which
blended into the hauntingly erotic
"Down To The Waterline." ’ "
Since their last‘ tour’, Dire Straits has
lost one member and gained two. Gone,
is rhythm guitarist Dave Knopfler who
left for unknown reasons. He has been
replaced by guitarist Hal Lindes, who is

ing out the Straits is Alan Clark on

Mob leader, and she carriesaround a
pistol that she shoots better than John I
Wayne ever could. When the couple
down the hall beg Gloria to/take their
son because they're about'to get knocked
off, she says, "But! I don't like
kids—especially yours."/But she's finally
convinced of the seriousness of the mat-
ter and takes the boy, Phil _(_lohn
Adames), back to her apartment where,
baffled as to what to do with this six
year-old Puerto—Rican/American‘ kid,
she says, "Hey kid, I'vegot some gold-
fish in the bedroom—you wanna "play"
with them?" . _' C"

took the smoke—filled Agora stage. It was‘:

keyboards. Apparently, these two new
members are only along for the concert

The sound of Dire Straits is an _
awesome interplay of instruments -that

array of infectious Knopfler

Knopfler, who is definitely the central. I
- force of the group, weaved in and out of
4 this musical foundation with the unique,
breathtaking guitar-playing and vocals
that have become Dire Straits’
trademark. '
The Straits were a lot less rigid than
,they were last year in Cleveland. The

’ - band's style was‘ looser but not the least

bit sloppy. ‘One vast improvement was
that the songs, werenot note-for-note
renditions of the albumtversions. '
The two hour set consisted of an equal H
distribution of songs from all three of
their albums, the latest being the Making
.Movies release. Standoutsl included
"Skateaway," "Romeo and Juliet,"
"News," "In the Gallery," "Wild West
End," ’’Tunnel of Love," and the classical
"Sultans Of Swing." ' .
The biggest disappointment ‘ of the if
- night was the Agora crowd. Theiaud-4 ‘
ience response was horrible, and no
doubt the cause of only a single encore.
Cleveland obviously didn't deserve Dire
Straits.. -‘ I

the Mob, left him.» But Gloria has‘ a
problem: she's friends with these

’ gangsters. They don't want to kill her,
they just want her to give them the boy,
which she won't or can't.

There's a scene in the film where
Gloria almost cleansesherhands of the
entire mess. She and Phil have just slip-
ped out of a -building where they. were ’
being chased, but she knows they'll catch
up with them any minute now and she A
doesn't know what to do. She wonders

‘ aloud what she's doing, and finally
decides that it"sVnot her responsibility,
