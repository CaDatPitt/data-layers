General Studies Election

Six Students Slated for  

(Continued from Page 1)
“The majority of students are
totally unaware of what's going on
in the Cabinet. By informing them

_ .,g'ﬁ,¢3f facilities open to students, they
T“ can become involved if they so

choose,” said Cohn, a junior
Administration of Justice major.
The newsletters ‘would also be
helpful in notifying students of
positions available to SGS repre-
sentatives on
councils where participation is
vital, according to ‘Synan.

“Until we had a government, the
University refused to admit it had a
night school. The only way we get
responses to our needs is through a
vocal government,” said Synan, a
junior who served on the 1974-75
Cabinet Council.

Cohn, who has chaired the social

 by-laws committees, said she

hopes to encourage more informa-
tion exchange among Council, the
representatives on various com-
mittees and students.

‘‘‘One person from Council should
be an ex ofﬁcio member in a
committee to serve as a liaison. My
biggest objection this year is to the
lack of interaction between people

. involved. No reports are ﬁled on



these meetings,” Cohn said. .
Candidate Synan said she wants

to organize a business luncheon

with local corporate and personnel

department heads to promote SGS‘

and its graduates. V
“SGS is the least-known school in

v.V,.».-(?\
w.-«§""‘the local business community. We

want to let these companies know
about our graduates.
especially interested in reaching
companies where, many of our
students already work full-time.
We want them to promote our
students before they recruit from
outside the company,” said Synan.

__;,?lﬁ;lKSGS Cabinet president and

K‘ —
-4‘,

council members have equal voting
rights on all issues and are
responsible for academic and
administrative policies, according
to Student Agent Debby Hornbake.

The officers’ duties include
developing the budget for SGS
student activities fee, which totals
$70,000 per year; appointing six

inter-university

I amt

.. 110 BOUQUET STREET,

students to the SGS Dean's council;

_appointing chairmen of the social,

ﬁnance, judicial and" communica-
tions committees; and overseeing
operation of the Cabinet ofﬁce,
which is open daily to handle
student complaints.

Both Synan and Cohn said they
would like to continue holding the
SGS picnic, graduation dinner and
the weekly rap sessions, all of
which are financed through the
activities fee. The candidates also
expressed an interest in working
with the Student Government
Board on the tuition hike issue.

The unopposed candidates for
Council are: Esther Hayman,
elementary 'education; Tom"
McHugh, English writing; Patti
Thompson, natural sciences; and
Don Shapland, philosophy.

Elections will be held Tuesday
through Thursday from 4:30 to 8:30
pm in the Lawrence Hall lobby,
Langley Hall lobby and_ ground
floor of the Cathedral. Students can
also vote at the South Hills Campus
March 19 only. ID and validation

Pitt’s case. I

The Chancellor also hopes to

accompany small teams of faculty
and staff members,‘ as well as
students, to Harrisburg to win
support for Pitt in the legislature.

“I want to call on every last
representative of the House,” he
said. - I
Posvar claimed the whole budget
issue may take months to resolvei
and even if Pitt’s allocation ‘is
equalized on a scale with Penn
State and Temple, state funds will
"fall far short of the University's
projected needs for the next ﬁscal
year.

If Pitt’s state budget remains at
its present level of $53.7 million,
the Chancellor predicted “things
would be very tight” at the
University next year.

The fifth-annual Soap Box Derby

will begin noon Thursday on Lytton _

Street behind Syria Mosque.
Engineers’ Week will end with

/Friday night’s Shamrock Ball and
‘awards presentation in Syria

Mosque. Awards will go to
outstanding seniors in each de-
partment, and the Shamrock
Trophy will go to the department
accumulating the most points from
Engineer’s Week competitions.

I

He admitted a substantial in-
crease in tuition might be
necessary if the state budget is not
revised. But Posvar did not feel it
was appropriate to say how much a
substantial increase might be,
since there are so many variables
involved. I

Students will have an opportunity
in the near future, the Chancellor
said, to engage in the effort to
convince state legislators Pitt’s
budget appropriation is too low.

“But it could be counter-
productive if busloads of students
went to Harrisburg to protest,” he
pointed out. “Something like that
could irritate a lot of people.”

Posvar insisted the budget issue is
a delicate situation that must‘ be
handled W1tl'l extreme care.

t

consider myself as one who has a
general understanding of‘ what
students want.”

Greater identification with black
students can be achieved by ‘

entrusting the role of mediator to
different individuals in the Towers

and MCNR, according to Walton. . is

In addition, BAS executives must
be accessible to their constituents.

Walton agreed with the other
candidates that BAS needs to
become more closely intertwined
with the black studies department.

“The Curtiss Porter incident isn't I I 0'

over yet," said Walton. “The
struggle. for black student self-
determination is continuing, and
we don’t want to face the same
problem when Porter ﬁnishes his
term.”

Whichever candidate receives the

BAS mandate Wednesday will be,

assisted by the deputy chairman in
designing policy and implementing
office programs. _

Williams, who will be entering the
School of Social Work in Septem-
ber, plans to move BAS toward
active participation in other cam-
pus committees next year.

Hayes, the other deputy chairman
candidate, refused to make a
statement, saying, “I think I can do
the job, that’s all.”

Offering a Good Case

The" possibility of a tuition increase, made more realistic by
Chancellor Posvar’s mention in a recent- Update, has prompted the
Student Government Board (SGB) to concern itself with lobbying for a
more favorable appropriation from the state.

The foundation for Pitt’s lobby nmst restin the eﬁectiveness of a

V The agreement by the SGB to coordinate its plans with the

. ' administration was a requisite for getting the Pitt movement off the
‘ ground. Other more speciﬁc obstacles, however, won't be so easy to
-' overcome. Nevertheless they too are necessary for an effective

operation.
- First of all, writing letters to legislators is easy enough to call for, but
is not ‘formidable enough to convince the group to modify its decision.

The legislature is interested in applying money where it will result in
an optimum yield for Pemisylvania. The University lobbying group
must be prepared to offer hard facts: the Pitt student’s value to the
state, the quality at Pitt, and reasons for spending education funds

‘ here at the expense of Penn State, Temple and other state-supported

schools.

The only case Pitt should present in Harrisburg is the clearest and
most straightforward one. To pull off dreamy master“ plans involving
marches and ‘Dear Representative’ letters is to waste both the
legislature's and our time. We are involved in an issue that deals with
cold facts, currently the coldest fact, money. And it is only through our
olfering of cold facts that we will receive the extra dollars we seek.

Injustice Facing Dutch

 

Dear Editor:

I have recently been following the
articles in the Pitt News on the
equality issue. I will not clutter this
space with arguments pro or con,
but I shall comment on.a greater
injustice; the discrimination a-
gainst the Dutch People. Think
about it for a second, when
someone talks about Holland or the
Dutch people you immediately
picture a little boy_ with wooden
shoes with his ﬁnger in a dike, or

‘ Hans Brinker skating to the local

windmill. Contrary to what you
may think, all Dutchmen do not
have blond hair and blue eyes,
electricity is not obtained by
windmills, and tulip bulbs are not
the only exports.

I propose a new organization be

A formed: The National Association

for the Advancement of Dutch
People [NAADP]. The association
would fight to get lower admission
standards for entering college,
more money from -the federal
government in the form of Basic
Grants, a “Dutch Studies” pro-
gram and a token number of Dutch
on construction jobs.

Although Hollanders never had to
pick cotton, the Dutch people were
oppressed by a far stronger force:
Nature. For hundreds of years the
Dutch have fought the sea. So
whenever you (the minority) think
of how bad you have it, just think
for a moment about the plight of
the Dutch People and support the
NAADP. ~

Sincerely,
Dennis Dirkmaat

 

Updated Prison
An Old Model-T

Dear Editor:

In the past incarcerated offenders
(convicts) were mostly culture-
oriented and ideal-bound. But the
present crop is a product of our
societal anomie and we ‘witness
operational chaos in our contem-
porary. correctional facilities
(prisons). b

There is something “new” going
on now: A social‘ pathological
anlage. It is a» mutation of monstra
per excessum. The future inﬂux of
offenders will be nihilistic. -The

future, of course, is happening

now. The portents of nihilism are
everywhere manifest in the cor-
rectional field. We are doing
nothing about it unless token
programs within the framework can
be called-doing something.

We need to overhaul the entire
correction bit; we need to get out of
the prison business. Prisons are
NOW morally and ﬁnancially bank-
rupt. Warehous_ing and body-
counting are now untenable.

Wexneed to get rid of the Tag
Plant. No dairies, no furniture
factories, no farms, no canning, no
industry at all. Prisons are false

communities at best. Everyone in

wants‘ out.- So, we must stop
competing with the dominant com-
munity and instead prepare of-
fenders for the larger community.
This domesticity stuff presently
characterizing prison life is within
the old framework and only serves
to perpetuate a system that is
parasitic from any view.

We need six OFFENDER RE-
CEPTION CENTERS (ORC) in the
Commonwealth: two in the West-
ern part of our State, two in the
Central part of our State, and two

in the Eastern part. One ORC for ‘

violence-prone offenders and one
ORC for offenders who commit
crimes against property, in each
region. Anyone convicted of a
crime against a person (violence)
MUST be committed to the nearest
facility for violence-prone offen-
ders. ' .

Once out of the PRISON BUSI-
NESS all offenders in our ORC’s
would be attending both vocational
and educational classes. Academic
potential must be attained. Also,
each offender must enroll in a
vocational course. IN six months .t_(_)
a year those offenders making good
progress could then be transferred
to a Community Service Center
(CSC)--there to work and continue
the vocational courses they are
pursuing. Or, in the case of the
intellectually endowed,
college level courses. The only
work incarcerated offenders would

continue _

do would be maintenance and
housekeeping of their facility. All
this as a program for the ORC that
houses the non-violent offender, of
course. A battery of vocational and
psychological aptitude tests would
be given to each and every offender
when he is received. Upon transfer
to a CSC, he would be given a
battery of attitudinal tests. We
must look for the social indicators
as well as for academic and
vocational achievements to justify
transfer to a Community Service
Center. In the ﬁnal analysis we
have to take a chance with human
beings. There is no other valid
argument. We can only know if the
offender now has social controls or
not by simply finding out, Pseudo-
philosophies are of no help.
Indicators, yes’; speculation, no.
Now, for the three ORC’s that
house those offenders who have
committed crimes against people:

We know who they are. But‘ they,

more of the Quid Pro Quo in our
rehabilitation procedures and less
of this unearned domesticity stuff
and benefits through number

grams have good teachers!

So let’s get out of the Prison
Business. The growth model for

rehabilitation works and is much

cheaper than our present antiqua-

too, must be committed to the
violence-offender facility for, per-
haps, a year. The resultant psychic
vacuum has to be -refurbished.
Then he can be transferred to the
nonviolence-offender facility for
continued handling.

Perhaps the Applied Anthropolo-
gists and the Educational Coun-
selors could run the nonviolence-
offender facility and the Psycholo-
gists run the ORC for those who
commit crimes against people.

Once all this is set up, we could
abolish the anachronistic Bureau of
Correction, whatever that is, and
place the incarcerated offender
under the jurisdiction of the De-
partment of Education.‘ Afterall,
we are talking about LEARNING.

About these present so-called
“programs”: furloughs. Our
furlough program is a sop to the

devised? For the overseer of the
erring-one? I am ‘only asking a
question. A good rehabilitation
specialist, like a . good doctor,
should strive to put himself out of
business. Also, if we are to make
an omelet we will have to break
some eggs. If we must -have jol;
security, okay, transfer unneeded
department heads, -foremen _ or
whatever to other’ state agencies.
In the criminal justice field we are
fooling around with other people’s
lives and we have to be sincere and
we have to be RIGHT. Let’s get out
of the prisonbusiness now and get
on with thoughtful innovativeness.
We can do anything we want to if
it"s logical and we have the will to
do it. We have the knowledge.
The Governor.’s criminal justice
commission departments of Pitt,
Penn State and University of
Pennsylvania could handle this new
procedure. Let’s get on with it.

The first set was a lot of ﬂat

one time Merle played slide and
another time he played banjo.
Mike played pedal steel with his

“Women at Plclyz" Sorry J
Folks, Here But Gone  

BY TOBI ROSEN
Arts Editor

“...that you take this article, mix it with bits and pieces of glass and
then, with all your might, shove it up...”

Hold it. There's been a change in the game plan. Replacing Jess M.
Brallier as Arts and Entertainment Editor is...me. And that's what this
column was supposed to be about. Just another “Jess has gone on to
bigger and better worlds, so tah-dah, you’re stuck with me.” It was
going to abound with appropriate alliterations with a possible
metaphor or two thrown in for dessert. _ ‘

But there’s been a change in my game plan. And not by my own
volition, mind you. But ever since last night, I can’t get something off
my mind. Last night was something special. Last night was something
different. Last night was the closing of Women at Play: A Collage.

This collection of vignettes was inspired by the tribulations we of the
female persuasian must face. Dating patterns, menstruation, rape,
marriage, sex and True Romance magazine were just some of the
subjects the Women treated both honestly and intelligently. Paula
Swart and Mimi Skoog created and directed this “collage" within
several different styles, to uphold the play’s consistency. Satire and
straight drama are the most effective of those used in Women. But
what really pumpedilife into the play was the low key humor.

And surprisingly enough, it wasn’t the kind of “women, aren’t they
cutesy” patronage. Nor was it the utterly rude and silly pretension of
“we’re tired of all this sexism, so let’s go out and put those animals
(men) in their place”. Overcompensation doesn't erase sexist
thoughts. It just gives them to somebody else.

But what made Women so fresh and “interesting was this new
perspective superimposed on the same old women’s lib battle cries.
There were no Bella Abzugs, Ti-Grace Atkinsons or even Gloria
Steinems. It was more the intellectual sophistication and warmth of
Ella Grasso or Glenda Jackson.

And there might have been a possible Glenda Jackson lurking among
the cast. The acting was consistently strong and managed to seep into
each characterization. Becauseof the short exposure to the different
characters, little time was wasted in the probing process. And
technically, Women rose in each department (especially lighting) to
. accompany the actions.

Unfortunately, Women at Play: A Collage ran for only one weekend. ,

Yep folks, put your coats back on, it’s gone. And maybe this whole
review is a farce. Who cares if the show was good, bad, boring or‘
somewhere in between? “I won't be able to see it anyway,” some may
protest. (For those with weak stomachs for apple pie sweetness, skip
the last part. For those who can differentiate the maudlin from the
sincere, read on.) A

But Women and the kind of “non-commercial” experiments shown in
Studio need not only a platform to shout from but an intelligent, open
audience that is willing to give these kind of productions the chance
they deserve.

Anthologies on the Move

BY HARRIS LEVY

-. Tired of the same old antholo-
gies? You know the ones that are
either eclectic mishmashes or brief
excerpts from dozens of famous,
authors.

Many anthologies I've come
across offer quantity instead of
quality. If authors are truly worth
your time, you’re not going to
settle for one play or two short
stories or ﬁve poems. And you’ll
probably spurn anthologies by

lesser-known authors in favor of-

the thousandth collection of “Great

Short Stories by Famous American
Authors." '

Thus, if I say several recent
anthologies published as paper-
back originals by Pocket Books are
among the best I've ever seen, it
won’t seem like much of a
compliment.

And you’re probably skeptical
about the thought of good books
making their ﬁrst appearance in
paperback. Aren't most paperback
originals Kojak. books or the like?

These anthologies are differ-
ent. ‘They’ve got a purpose.
They’re organized around themes.
They present unfamiliar American
authors instead of Fitzgerald and
Hemingway. ‘ A

And just as you’ll be surprised at

the quality of these original
paperbacks, -you’ll be amazed at
the talent found in previously
neglected sources. ‘

“To my mind, there are more
accomplished writers at work in
America today than at any other
time in our history,” writes
Theodore Solotaroff in his “Edi-
tor’s Notes” for American Review
22_.

Later in the notes he comments,
“instead of small, relatively
homogenious creative elites which
have done the literary work of a
society at any given period, what

we have today in America is a kind
of democracy of creativity...

“Another development has been
the literary enfranchisement, as it
were, of the minorities--ethic,
racial, and cultural.”

As Solotaroff notes, “literature”
became “writing.” People who
were never heard from before
began to express themselves on
paper.

Hence the anthologies discussed
below. Work by Pulitzer Prize
winners--and high school students.
New voices, distinctively individual
views on the present--and people
trying to get in touch with the past.

These anthologies, issued over
the past few months, are represen-
tative of newly recognized Ameri-
can literary talent.

Readers familiar with Coover’s
delightful fantasy The Cat in the
Hat for President, published in
American Review in 1968, will have
some idea of what this versatile
author has produced this time.

In a completely different vein is
the late John Berryman’s short
story “Wash Far Away.” Like his
posthumously published novel
Recovery, “Wash Far Away” is
somewhat autobiographical.

A dejected professor finds
teaching Milton’s Lycidas prompts

a professor to reconsider his atti-

tude toward life. “He felt older
than he had in the morning, but he
had moved into the exacting con-
viction that he was...something...
not dead.”

These two stories are not the only
good pieces in American Review
22. There’s a story by Robert
Stone, author of the acclaimed Dog
Tags, published last year. Richard
Gilman, best known for his out-
standing theatre criticism, is rep-
resented by a sophisticated, en-
lightening and entertaining essay
tracing the evolution of the word
“decadence.”

“Foundation Pit” Falls in
“Pit” of Disioint Idea

BY TOM WASELESKI

The Foundation Pit

By Andrey Platonov
[translated by Mirra Ginsburg]
141 pp., $7.50

When reviewing a novel originally
written in a language other than
one’s own, the reviewer must
proceed with utmost caution in
determining how much of the prose
results from the author’s intention
and how much of it stems from the
catalytic inﬂuence of the translator.

Many a book has been ruined for
foreign readers by the inept
abilities of various translators. This
explains why there are many
versions of foreign classics: there is
a one-upmanship among transla-
tors, each feeling his/her version
more accurately depicts the au-
thor’s style, more effectively inte-
grates the work’s original language-
with the published idiom--in short,
is better than the last translation.

Students of great literature are_
thus at a loss when they do not
have the facility of a number of lan-
guages and are forced to_ rely on

translation. .

In the case of The Foundation Pit, I

it is difficult to decide who should
be indicted for a novel of such
disjoint ideas and confused per-
spectives—author Platonov or_
translator Ginsburg.

The novel deals with a group of
Soviet workmen thatis set with the
task of excavating the foundation
for a large structure to house the

townspeople.

Mirra Ginsburg, who is no fresh-
man translator, has set several
books to English, notably works by
Yevgeny Zamyatin and Mikhail
Bulgakov, including the epic satire
The Master and Margarita.

In her introduction to The Foun-
dation Pit, she is curiously evasive
in her summation of the book:
“The Foundation Pit is many
things. It is a cautionary tale, a
philosophic inquiry, a political gro-
tesque, a symbolic portrait of a
society and a period, and a frag-
mented self-portrait--a work of
many facets and marvelous inven-
tiveness...Platonov brings the ac-
tion, the characters, and the lan-
guage itself down to ultimate
absurdity.‘ He carries The Founda-
tion Pit beyond irony,‘ beyond
satire, to a point where everything
becomesa tragic parody‘ of itself.”

Ginburg’s assessment, obviously
intending to say everything, says
nothing after one gains the hind-
sight that comes with reading the
noveL ’

 Andrey ‘Platonov, who wrote the

book in the late 20's and early
30’s, appears to"be enmeshed in a

struggle with his characters. ‘they '

do not standiup straight;they are
hollow plaster casts of stereotypes

at best. The major reason for this is ..

partly Platonov’s atempt at a

"symbolism" so’ intense as to be

compared to the malodorous mix

Unlike most anthologies, Ameri-
can Review thrives on variety. The
lack of a consistent tone or posture
reflects the diversity and vitality of
current American writing.

The only bad news about Ameri-
can Review 22 is its announcement
that the number of issues per year

}will be reduced from three to two.

 American Review has pub-

lished the work of nearly 500
authors and will surely continue its
excellence. The next issue won’t
be published until September--but
it's worth the wait. '
“You really expect me, a college
student, to read an‘ anthology
written by high school women?”
Well, if you react that way to my
suggestion that you read
DAUGHTERS IN HIGH SCHOOL
(Daughters, Inc. 244 pages: $3.80)
it’s your loss. One of two
anthologies on this list written by
high school students, Daughters in
High School presents “the realities

.../i"',.o.[\growing up female in American

society today.”

An ironically humorous view is
taken of a young woman's ﬁrst
purchase of sanitary napkins in “A
Woman’s Answer to Rudyard Kip-
ling.” Humor is just one asset of
Daughters In High School, perhaps
the best book on this list.

These women present real talent,
unspoiled by pretentiousness and
artifice that mars some college
writing. Real ingenuity distin-
guishes a poem called “Freeze-
Dried Kharma,” which takes rock
lyrics and, weaving them together,
juxtaposes them in a brilliant way.

sion as Asians and women; the
author dissects the common
stereotypes about Asian women in
an essay where anger is blended
with thoughtful analysis.

Daughters in High School would
be difficult to overpraise. It covers
a lot of ground but it’s well-
organized. The prose and poetry
are accessible but no less artful
than longer and more complex
works.

At its best, Daughters combines
personal experience, insight into
society’s treatment of women, a
hard look at reality and clever
fantasy.

WHO SPEAKS FOR

APPALACHIA? (273 pages: $1.95) V

Appalachia has been frequently
ridiculed or pitied by outsiders. But
this anthology of songs, prose and

poetry will remind readers o'f “the

legends, the ballads, the folklore
that have passed almost unchanged
through centuries in the hills.”
Whether the authors are famous

like Thomas Wolfe and James‘

Agee or anonymous, all contribu-
tors acknowledge the uniqueness of
the Appalachians, “who want to be
part of America without being
trampled."

cheese. Symbolic themes, when in
the right hands, infect the air with
an occasional sweetness that leaves
the reader euphoric with the know-
ledge that every stitch of meaning
in the story holds together in one
large, great whole.

Every character seems to repre-
sent one facet of another of Soviet
political society. The girl Nastya,
daughter of a deceased bourgeoise,
_i§ projected as Russian youth, the
hope and undimming light of the
future. The bear, which performs
every human function but speak-
ing, is an all-too obvious facsimile
of the official Soviet; it hammers
unceasingly in the blacksmith
shop, fashioning, supposedly, the
ideals of tomorrow.

The author gives as little back-
ground for any worthwhile charac-
ter development. There is no sense
of temperament or personality in
his actors. Their lack of life and
breath may be attributed to the

endless platitudes that emanate
from their mouths. They are con-
stantly contemplating their exis-
tence;there is no real living going
on.

Platonov is too deliberate in his

didacticism. If he meant to tell a '

parable, then let it be a parable’s

length,» for if the reader’s ears are ’

not deaf from the start, they are
certainly deafened as the story
unfolds.

This is Soviet socialist realism in
its crudest excess. The characters
are cardboard props, their thoughts
are_too removed from the immedi-
ate concerns of day-to-day survival,-
even the action is treated as

inconsequential and no effective‘

scenes spring forth.

Ginsburg seems to be offering an

apology: ‘‘If the reader ﬁnds much
of the text un-English, it is because
the original is un-Russian. Indeed,

if I have sinned occasionally, it was

in the opposite direction--reverting

Southern Illinois Salukis. Harris hit eight of 13 from the field with

BY RICK STOUFFER
V Sports Editor
Detroit.-Detroit, the motor city--

I home of Motown records and cops

riding Honda 175's--has become
the center of indoor track cham-

rpionships for the past 11 years.
'This year was no exception.

As was the case last year, Cobo

 - Arena housed the National Collegi-
, ate Athletic Association’s I gala

event. The beautiful structure
featured oger 500 athletes and 102
schools from a surprising 20
countries.

As it did last year, the University
Paso (UTEP)
dominated the two day affair.

- UTEP garnered 36 team points

while runner-up Kansas State

could muster a mere 17‘/2.

. All competition at Cobo Arena

was on a board track. These tracks
are banked, are shorter than ﬂat
tracks, and take more laps for
distances. It also sounds like a
roller coaster when runners pound
it with their feet.

Three NCAA indoor records were
broken in the city not known for its
friendly, laughing population.

Earl Bell, a 19-year-old sopho-

' more from Arkansas State, broke
. the pole vault mark with a height

of _17’2_”, surpassing the old mark
of 17’1‘/4” held jointly by Jan
Johnson of Alabama, Mike Wed-
man of Colorado and Scott Wallick

' .of Miami of Ohio.

Second place ﬁnisher Larry Jessee
of UTEP had probably the best
vaults of the day but ﬁnished
second with a mark of 16’7”.

When Jessee was. good he cleared
the bar by at least half a foot, but

. when he was bad he couldn’t clear
-1 his throat.

UTEP won the shotput for the

9 third year in a row by importing a
‘ bear from Sweden who broke his
-. old record with a put of 67’93/4”.
- ’ Hans Hoglund won on only his

second toss and his piercing
‘scream seemed to psych out the

. opposition as the second position

man, Dana LeDuc of Texas at
Austin, could manage only a
measly 64’4”.

Hoglund believed he could have
gone farther if the event had been
run differently. “I was going well
in the second group but we had to
‘break for the third. Nobody did well
in the third and I don’t prefer that
kind of _ competition. I really
thopght Ihad my best form of the

year until we stopped.”

The third NCAA record was‘

broken in the triple jump as Arnold
Grimes, another of UTEP’s corp of
gifted athlets, went 55’4”, shatter-
ing the old mark of 54’6%” set by
Tommy Haynes of Middle Tennes-

- see in 1974.

Grimes has been experimenting
with different training ideas, using
Russian methods (he competed
against the USSR last year) and a
few Australian ideas.

“I wasn’t sure I would be ready
for this meet in terms of training.
My ankles were hurting as a result
of new methods of working out and

‘ the short runway of an indoor track

isn’t suited to my style. It’s good I
got a break in between to really set
myself mentally.”

The two mile run featured Nick
Rose, a Canadian from Western
Kentucky, against Joshua Kimeto,
a Kenyan from Washington State.
Rose’s time of 8:44 ﬂat was nothing
to get excited about, but did take
ﬁrst by eight tenths of a second.

In the three mile run, certainly the
longest (33 laps) event, the action
was far from boring, as John Ngeno
took command at the three quarter
mark and smashed his own record
with a time of 13:14.4 seconds, a
full seven seconds ahead of Tony
Stayning'of Western Kentucky.

'5 The 60 high hurdles was one of

the most exciting events of the two
day affair, with the entire field
loaded with the speed needed to

win.

The winner turned out to be
defending champion Danny Smith
of Florida State in a time of seven
seconds ﬂat. Second was Charles
Foster of North Carolina Central,
who is currently ranked number
one in the world.

Smith became the only man to
ever win the event twice. He also
had been beaten by Foster earlier
in the year.

“The biggest change I have made
over the past year is at beter
development of my physical self,”
Smith said. “I have been working
extra hard and feel in better shape
than ever before.”

Hasley Crawford of Eastern
Michigan was the big winner in the
60 yard dash. Despite a horrible
start out of the blocks, Crawford
caught and passed defending
champ Cliff Outlin of Auburn and
ﬁnished in six seconds ﬂat.

The Pitt basketball team got some
spectacular shooting from relativ-
ely unexpected sources Saturday
night, enabling the Cats to cruise to
a 70-65 victory over the Salukis of
Southern Illinois University (SIU)
in the first round of NIT action at
New York’s Madison Square
Garden. Freshman Larry Harris hit
for 16 points, all from the ﬁeld, and
Keith Starr scored 21, well above
his average, as Pitt advanced to
Tuesday’s quarterﬁnal action op-
posite the Friars of Providence.

Pitt was unable to stop the
Salukis’ big man, 6’11” Joe C.
Merriweather, who scored 26," but
it really didn’t matter because the
remainder of the Southern Illinois
squad was unable to crack the
tough Pitt defense, which was as
sharp as it has been all season.

The Panthers did their. best to
slow Merriweather down and
managed to do at least that’. They

and you are disqualiﬁed). You can’t
get a good start because you spend
all your time worried about who is
where. If I could have gotten a
better start, I could have made a
5.9.”

Pitt’s own entrants in the
championships, Karl Farmer and
Chuck Mozingo, finished high in
the standings.

Farmer ﬁnished ninth with a 49.5
on the board track, his best time of
the year. Unfortunately, 49.4 was
needed for the ﬁnals.

“I should have ‘done better,” said
Farmer. “There wasn’t too much
bumping on the track, which was a
good thing. I tried to get out fast
but it wasn’t fast enough ‘as I
chased the competition.

“I don’t_ like the indoors for
running,” Farmer continued. “I
should have pretty good times in
the outdoors. I don’t plan to lose.”

Mozingo also ﬁnished ninth,
missing the ﬁnals by a single tenth.
“I thought I was running faster
than I was,” Moze said. “I broke
out in front but my quarter wasn’t
fast enought; Now being used to

either.

“You know it’s really funny,”

Mozingo continued. “Last week at.

Assistant Track Coach Mike

'Agostinella was generally pleased
with the showing of his two Cats.

“Of course I'm disappointed they
didn’t make
especially since both would have
placed in the top six going by the
times ran. It’s unfortunate Chuck

qualify for the ﬁnals. It’s a shame a

track can't have the organization it
deserves.”

All in all, Detroit was a great place
to hold the NCAA indoor track
championships. The reason was
clear--there was nowhere for the
athletes to stray or ﬁnd trouble

held him to just eight points in the
ﬁrst, half while building a 37-26
halftime lead, and then hung on
despite a second half surge that left
the Salukis just short.

Melvin Bennett did a commend-
able job harrassing Merriweather
by changing his defensive position
frequently, making it hard for the
big center to adjust. The Panthers
were reluctant to place too much
emphasis on stopping Merri-
weather,.however, because of the
capable shooting of guard Mike
Glenn, who managed 18 points,
primarily from long range.

“We felt we had to front
Merriweather but we didn’t want to
double team him,” said Pitt head
coach Charles ‘Buzz’ Ridl. “Teams
that have tried that this year have
gotten burned.” A

With Merriweather struggling to
get the feel of the Pitt defense in
the ﬁrst half, the Cats managed to
shut off much of the Salukis’
offense. The Southern Illinois
attack, seriously hindered by the
loss of forward’ Tim Ricci, who
broke a bone in his foot, was
consistent only in its inconsistency,
and the rugged ‘amoeba’ was able
to generate enough turnovers to
produce the double. ﬁgure margin.

Pitt led most of the game, after

grabbing a 14-13 lead with 11:20

left in the ﬁrst frame. Starr scored
on a driving lay-up and Harris
followed up with a fadeaway jump
shot from the middle‘ of the key just
20 seconds later. The Cats slowly
built upon their lead with Starr and
Harris accounting for much of the
offense and Bennett taking care of

_bounds to 37 for SIU.

the primary defensive assignment.

Once Merriweather got hot, the
Salukis were at least able to get
back in the game. As they did
against West Virginia last week,
the Cats seemed to falter at the
start of the second half, hitting just

one of their first five shots as their ,,,.I'F=‘«;

le/ad decreased to 39-34.
Three minutes later Southern
Illinois was one point closer, 46-42,

following a pair of jump shots by 6

Glenn. But following a Pitt
timeout, the Cats ran the lead back
to ten with baskets by Starr and
Harris and a pair of free throws by
Bennett. -

The Salukis came right back to cut
the lead to ﬁve again, 56-51, with
just under ten minutes remaining.
Once more Ridl called his team to
the bench. The result was two
ﬁeldgoals from Harris and a‘
beautiful lay-up by Willie Kelley
following a tough rebound.

After SIU cut the lead to five
again, Pitt pulled off one last
surge, with baskets by Starr and
Harris and a pair by Tom Richards,
who scored seven points in the
game, giving the Cats a 70-60 lead.‘
With time running out, the Salukis
made a valiant effort to pull off a
win, but the clock buried them.

Pitt managed to shoot slightly
better from the ﬁeld, with 47
per cent to 45rfor SIU. The Cats
were also able to cut down on their

turnovers and totaled just ten, with

Should Outsiders Compete
In Championship Track?

BY RICK STOUFFER
Sports Editor

I had the great pleasure of
attending the National Collegiate
Athletic Association’s annual in-
door track championships in De-

-troit over the weekend and came

away with mixed emotions.

On onephand I was very impressed
with the caliber of the competition
in all events. From the beginning,
announcer Jack O’Reilly said this
was probably the strongest field
ever assembled for indoor track
and it certainly was true. Since it is
only a year until the Olympics in
Montreal, every contestant had to
be planning for it in the back of his
mind.

But the other thought I came away
with concerned the surprising
number of athletes) from foreign
countries competing for US univer-
sities.

This is not a put-down of for-
eigners, so don’t get me wrong.
My thought is if an athlete is given
a grant and allowed to compete in
this country, why must he leave the
US‘ when the Olympics begin and
compete for his home land? _

Many Americans miss out on the
money from grants they ‘might
receive if fewer foreign athletes
were not competing here. For
example, the University of Texas at
El Paso (UTEP), which easily won
the team championship this year
36-17% over Kansas State, brought

15 athletes to Detroit. Of these, 11
were from outside the US. Peter
Farmer, UTEP’s 35 pound weight
thrower, is a Canadian. Hans
Hoglund and Hans Almstrom are
from Sweden,*. Chris Garpenborg,
who would have been in the finals
of the 60 yard dash if not for a
originally from

This is not to say UTEP is the only
one importing people to build up its
program. Mike Sands of Penn
State won the 440 yard dash with a
time of .48.5. Sands is from the
Bahamas. Joshua Kimeto, who
placed second in the two-mile and.
John Ngeno, who won the three-
mile competition, are Kenyans!
-Hasley Crawford of Eastern Michi-

-gan is another Bahaman and,,...,.g;;_

Wesley Maiyo of Wyoming, who
ﬁnished second in the 1,000 yard
run, is another Kenyan. Seton
Hall, which won the team title at _
Princeton two weeks ago in the
Eastern Championships, has a
squad of about 90% foreign "stu-
dents. V
The United States has until rec-
ently dominated many track and
ﬁeld events at the Olympics. '
However, in recent years this
superiority has declined. Many
people have wondered why. One
reason would be what I have just
explained. Not only are many
Americans not getting the training
they need to compete in Olympic
competition, but many foreign
athletes are returning to their home

' countries with this training.

UTEP Head Coach Ted Banks has
said he knows about the great
amount -of athletes’ coming from
other countries, but he doesn’t

"know how to stop it. In Banks’ case

the answer would be clear--quit
looking for athletes outside the US
and concentrate on building from
within. Banks is known as a person
who could sell ice to polar bears.

.~;%’'-‘'‘

‘\

‘r

He is a great letter writer when it 

comes to getting top athletes,
regardless of their home lands. ,

If the American people wonder
what happened to their great
American talent, maybe they
should ask Ted Banks. I’m curious
to know his reply.

Pitt score and, with the aid of good
back-checking, tied the game at the
2:37 mark on Tom Grimm’s
rebound shot, which followed Pitt
goalie Johnny DeFazio’s save on
Dave Cornelius.

At about the ‘6:00 mark, the
momentum swung to Pitt, where it
stayed until the ﬁnal minutes of the
game when the Panthers had the

-contest put away. Vernon got his

second goal of the game at 8:32
when a pass intended for Browne in
the slot managed to bounce up and
into the Tarton goal.

CMU tied the game at 2-2 early in
the second period with the first of

» four goals by Matt Goldsmith, who

riﬂed in a twenty-footer.

The Panthers then caught ﬁre and
went on to score four unanswered
goals, building up a 6-2 lead after
two frames. Hagins threw the puck
into the slot where Vernon swept it
in for a short-handed goal,- while
Russ Stump, in and out of. the
penalty box all day, sat out a
double minor. , i .

With 9:11. gone, Vernon launched
a powerful snapshot from 30 feet

‘out and beat Sciulli over the Tartan

goalie’s right ,-shoulder. Hagins
knocked in a slapshot from the

footer after taking a pass from‘ Bill

Camegie-Mellon came out ﬁred
up for the third period and
narrowed the margin right off the

Pitt iced away the victory with two

OFFICIAL INSPECTION STATION

In NHL

BY CONNIE GIEL

You shouldn’t need a broadcaster -
to tell you who the favorites are,
neck and neck in the scoring race
for the NHL’s Art Ross Trophy.

Bobby Orr, earlier the ultimate
finisher for second honors, tapped
in three assists last week to pull the.
lead away from teammate Phil
Esposito. 0rr’s 121 points--38 of
them goals--is just one point shy of
his ﬁnal scoring record last season.

Orr, Boston’s offensive defense-

 

man, broke his own record for most '

goals in a season by a defenseman
(37). His 38th goal came in
Boston’s 5-2 win over Atlanta
March 9. 0rr’s four points to

. Esposito’s one in that game opened

the race. '

Dissension among those lower in
the ranks has broken out‘, with less
than a dozen games per team to, go
in the regular season.

Esposito, Boston’s burly center-"
man, has won the scoring {title five
times in the past six seasons. He
set an NHL record for most points

in a season, 152, in ‘70-’7l and-
: nearly equalled it last year with 145

points. Espo also guards records
for most goals and assists in a
season by a center. Only Orr--Mr.
Everything--has more assists.
Laughably, the record books tag
“by a defenseman” onto the
notation.

Orr still leads going away in the
assists department, but Philadel-
phia’s MVP Bobby Clarke is press-
‘ing for an NHL record of his own.
Captain Clarke’s 70 assists are just
seven shy of Esposito’s ’73-’74
mark. Clarke’s paltry 23 goals,
however, knock him down to sixth
among the league scorers.

Since the All-Star game in Jan-
uary, which marked mid-season,
Clarke has moved up from eighth
place by displacing Buffalo’s Gil

. Montreal players.

Méiiﬂzly-,‘iMai'

two Sabre centers have remained
scoreless all week, while the top six
picked up goals and assists consis-
tently.

Perreault, out with a knee injury
most of January, missed twelve
games. But Montreal’s Guy
Laﬂeur hangs on to third place
despite being sidelined since Feb-
ruary 12 with a broken finger.
Lafleur, having a sensational sea-
son with 104 points, averaged 1.5
goals per game."

Pete Mahovlich, Lafleur’s line-
mate, is tied with his winger. The
6’5” center had only 37 assists in
his 73 points last year. Now, with
71 to his credit, Mahovlich set a
club record for assists in one
season.

Diminutive center Marcel Dionne,
captain of the lowly Detroit Red
Wings, moved out of ﬁfth place
behind the big name Boston and
Dionne’s 105
points, ﬁve of which were notched
last week, are helping to keep his
club out of the cellar in the James
Norris Division. .

Four of the six Pitt wrestlers
entered in the NCAA wrestling
tournament last weekend at Prince-
ton University failed to make it
through the first round of compe-
tition. The Panthers came home
with just one sixth place winner in
the tournament.

Rande Stottlemyer, wrestling at
134 pounds, equalled his ﬁne
performance of a year ago when he
finished sixth at 126 pounds,
earning the only team points for
Pitt, 6‘/2.‘

Stottlemyer got off to a quick start
in the tournament, winning his first
two matches to advance to the
quarterfinals. In the first round,
the sophomore from Sharpsville,
Pa. grabbed a hard fought 1-0
decision over Pat Quinlan of _Cen-
tral Michigan and followed it up
with a 14-5 rout of Kurt Mock of
Kentucky. ‘ -

Stottlemyer then dropped a tough
decision to Jim Miller of Northern
Iowa in the opening round of
Friday's action. The match was a
tight one and both wrestlers had
a shot at winning it, but Miller got
the lead and hung on to gain a 9-7
decision.

The loss to Miller eliminated
Stottlemyer from a shot at the 134
title but left him in the running for
third place. He entered the
consolation round Friday night
against Shuishi Shoji of the Uni-
versity of Oregon, who lost in the

V opening round to Miller (2-1) but

gained a place in the consolation on

the basis of Miller’s advancement
to the semi-finals.

The two wrestlers were well-
matched and the contest started as
a fierce struggle, with neither
wrestler able to gain a substantial
lead. Stottlemyer used his finesse
and quickness to offset Shoji’s
greater strength and was ﬁnally
able to wear his opponent down,
scoring three points in the ﬁnal
period for a 7-4 decision. ,_

Rande took much the same route
against Lloyd Ford of Colorado
‘State in his second match of the
evening, approximately one hour
later. Ford started strongly but
soon found himself no match for
the tough Pitt wrestler. Once
again, Stottlemyer finished with a
surge to grab a 7-3 victory and a
spot in the consolation semi-ﬁnals.

On Saturday, the Pitt grappler ran
up against a very strong opponent
in Mark _Belknap of William and
Mary. The two wrestlers had met
already this year in a pre-season
tournament at Millersville College.
_Belknap won that encounter by one
point in overtime and was equal to
the task again, gaining a hard-
fought 2-0 decision without really
getting the better of Stottlemyer.

Rande had only one match re-
maining, the struggle for fifth place
with Steve Barrett of Oklahoma
State, the Big Eight champion.
Stottlemyer was not able to com-
pete at full strength and Barrett
gained the victory by default.

The only other Pitt wrestler to get
past the first round was 126 pound

Bryant was involved in some of the
closest matches of the tournament,
dropping the first decision to Toshi
Oonishi of Washington, 4-4, 3-0 in
overtime. Fortunately for Bryant,
Oonishi made it to the semi-ﬁnals,
putting Bryant back in the running

Bryant’s next match was against

Cyclone wrestler grabbed a 4-2
win, eliminating Bryant from com-

the tournament were Bill Korth at

The four young Cats were unable
to get back in the competition

V,-“ebecause none of their opponents

l‘iTa?1de it through the quarterfinals.

The University of Iowa was the
overall team winner in the tourna-
ment with 102 points, snapping a
seven-year Big Eight winning
streak. The Big Eight also had
come away with 39 team cham-
pionships in the 44 previous NCAA

19.1.

In 1903, a groupxof engineering students',at:the University of Missouri decided they needed -a late winter
respite from their studies, and to support their claim, they/offered: a revelation-'—t_h'at Saint Patrick was
an engineer. In celebration of this ‘fact, they cut all classes on Saint Patrick's Day, -andiengaged in fun
and merriment. They were expelled for their'.eff'o1'.ts._ Luckily forwstudents at Pitt, the -tradition took «root
anyway, and MONDAY, MARCH” 17 (SAINT-‘ PATR_ICK’S DAY) will signal the start _of the annual
ENGINEERING’S WEEK; five days of parades, parties, ganies"l’:_ind concerts forlthe 'engineer’s whoput
