Though the underground parties of
high schoolers are still cause for con-
cern, a recent study suggests that teen-
agers who drink alone have higher risks
of developing problems.

In the upcoming issue of the jour-
nal Clinical Psychological Science, re-
searchers from Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity and Pitt will publish a study that
followed adolescents’ drinking habits

and outcomes. The 709 participants a‘

were collected from the Pittsburgh
Adolescent Alcohol Research Center,
and they were first interviewed when
they were between the ages of 12 and
18. The individuals were later assessed
for alcohol use disorders when they
turned 25. g - .

V Kasey Creswell, the lead author of
the study, said in a press release that V
individuals drinking non—socially are
often doing so after a conflict has oc-
curred. ,

Recent reports published by the Sur-
geon General state that 50 percent of
all 15-year-olds will have had at least
one drink.

Pentagon reports rising number of sexual assaults

Cristina Holtzer

Reports of sexual assault in the U.S. mili- ,

tary have increased 46 percent since last
year, according to a report published by
the Pentagon ‘earlier this month.

The. report, issued Nov. 7, statedthat

sexual assaults in the military. The ﬁrst

three quarters of this year saw 46 per-

reported during the same period of time
last year.

During the entirety of the last ﬁs-
cal year, 3,374 sexual assaults involving
service members as either victims or
perpetrators were reported.

With 88 cadets enrolled in Pitt’s ROTC
program, these statistics could prove to

While the increase in reported cases is

of crimes or a combination of the two.

Lt. Col. David Frakt, a lawyer for the
U.S. Air Force and a former Pitt profes-
sor of criminal and military law, said the
rise in reported assaults shows that the
military is doing a better job of handling
the problem and taking these crimes se-
riously.

“That may be encouraging more vic-
tims to come forward, as they are seeing

es are not suffering some of the negative
consequences that have been so widely
advertised,” Frakt said.

Frakt said their military officials are
making an effort to encourage victims
of sexual assault to report their experi-
ences. V

“There is [also] a huge push to educate
supervisors and commanders about the
importance of taking these allegations
seriously and of victims’ rights,” he said.

In 2004, the U.S. Air Force started
a task force to address sexual assault
within the military that later evolved

and handling cases of sexual assault. All
branches of the military implemented the
program soon after its creation, and now,
all service members must attend classes
on preventing sexual assault at least four
times per year. '

The U.S. Department of Defense de-
ﬁnes sexual assault as uninvited sexual
contact, unwanted touching of private
body parts, rape and sodomy. The sta-
tistics contained in the reports for ﬁscal
year 2012 and the first three quarters
of 2013 include reported cases of civil-

vice members assaulting other service
members.

Sean Kolar joined the U.S. Army
straight out of high school in North Riv-
erside, Ill., and served for 10 years as a
military policeman before deciding to
go to school. He is currently in his first

{year at Pitt.

Kolar agreed with Frakt that the num-
bers reﬂect a greater willingness on the
part of victims to report sexual assaults.

“It’s always been around,” Kolar said.
“Right now it’s probably being reported
more.”

Poor relief efforts in response to Typhoon Haiyan necessitate
student support, commitment to humanitarian aid

The aftermath was abysmal.
More than a week after Ty-
phoon Haiyan made landfall,
Filipinos still haven’t received
aid from either the Filipino
government or international
forces.

According to recent reports,
the death toll is climbing: CNN

reports 3,976 as_the most ac-

curate count. The United Na-
tions approximated last week
that the toll exceeded 4,200.
According to the Philippines’
National Disaster Risk Reduc-
tion and Management Council,
there are over 12,000 individ-
uals injured, with just under
2,000 still missing. The truly
concerning fact is that none of
these numbers are entirely cor-
rect: The typhoon’s destruction
has prompted widespread un-
certainty and confusion among
relief efforts and the people of
the Philippines. Fortunately,
institutions within the United
States and other developed na-
tions have already begun efforts
to raise relief funding. '
According to an NBC World
News article, Tim Shenk,
spokesman for Doctors Without
Borders, said the inaccuracy of
those affected stems from “se-
vere logistical difficulties” that
have deterred aid from spread-
ing throughout the country for
individuals in need of food, wa-
ter or medical assistance.
More than a week after Hai-
yan touched down, the Philip-
pine government is still facing
criticism for its slow response
to the crisis: many communi-
ties are still without help and
have no access to fresh water,
food or medical supplies. The
inability for any entity, whether

it be the United Nations or the
Filipino government, to accu-
rately asses the damage of Ty-
phoon Haiyan, sheds light on
both the temporary breakdown
of government operations to
disperse relief efforts and the
lack of commitment of interna-
tional powers to provide aid to
those affected. This breakdown
in the international system has
necessitated assistance from
individual institutions.

For one, the citizens of the
Philippines have taken it upon
themselves to conduct wide-
spread humanitarian efforts,
especially in the portions of the
Philippines that were hit the
hardest. Survivors in the city of
Tacloban have begun to reopen
gas stations, while survivors
have constructed stalls to sell
food and other goods.

Here in the United States,‘

colleges and universities na-
tionwide have initiated their
own relief efforts in order to
supplement the nearly $20 mil-
lion the U.S. government has
pledged‘ to provide in aid to the
Philippines. Princeton, Harvard
and the University of San Diego,
among others, have held ben-

' eﬁt efforts to raise money for

individuals affected by Haiyan.

The Pittsburgh City Coun-
cil is expected to consider a
proclamation to declare today
“Filipino American Association
of Pittsburgh Day” and encour-
age locals to help out, according
to an article in the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette.

“We know some people
from the Filipino community
who have their families back in
the Philippines, and they have
been struck with destruction,”

said Paula Pascual, president
of Pitt’s Filipino Students As-
sociation, in an email. ‘V

Pascual and "the FSA have
begun to organize fundraising
campaigns to make donations
to the American Red Cross,
AmeriCares and Operation USA
that will be used to aid the sur-
vivors of Haiyan.

Pascual noted that these
campaigns and planned fun-
draisers will coincide with a
fundraising dinner this Friday,
Nov. 22, at North Way Church
in Oakland. Both FSA and the
Asian Intervarsity organization
are hosting this dinner to raise
funds that will go directly to the
relief effort abroad.

Pascual also stressed that
the joint efforts’of the Filipino
community, including the Fili-
pino American Association of
Pittsburgh and the FSA, has
been instrumental in‘ this hu-
manitarian effort.

“It’s been really amazing,

and we are so thankful for.

everyone’s help and caring
thoughts,” Pascual said.
Students and communities
nationwide should continue to
contribute to rehabilitating the
individuals and families in the‘
Philippines. It is crucial that‘
we, as members of a university

with students hailing from a ‘
number of countries (includ- T

ing the Philippines), should
contribute to the national and
global humanitarian effort. It’s
our obligation and responsi-
bility.

“We will rise above this with

the strength and aid by all the

amazing people who [have]
helped us already,” Pascual
said.j

Path through the Philippines

Official death estimates are still being compiled after Typhoon
Haiyan’s direct hit on the Philippines, but an estimated 9.5
million people in the country have been affected by the storm.

American meritocratic behavior versusWa|I Street

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

One of the few things more American than
apple pie and reality TV is our traditional faith
in meritocracy.

It is embedded in our countrfs very foun-
dation, and it continues to be the key ingredi-
ent in the American dream —- it is the idea
that one’s lot in life should be based solely on
ability, not birth, race, sex or anything else.
For here in America, anyone can get ahead,
it just requires hard work and deterinination.

However, over the past 30 years, it appears
that avery small percentage of Americans are,
working much, much harder than the rest.
Actually, it’s 1 percent of the nation who hap-
pens to hold 19.8 percent of America’s total
pre-tax income. If the meritocratic tradition
has held true over the years, this is the result
of a true egalitarian process. ’ A

When it comes to income inequality, no
other country in the developed world ranks
higherthanthe United States. .

And this has been no accident, as Washing- e

 

student organizations

ton is pretty much allied with the corporate .

elite —- a fact that is no secret by any means.
It has been the trend for years: cut taxes for
the rich while increasing subsidies to wealthy
corporations, the logic being that a healthy
elite is beneﬁcial for others in that itwill create
jobs and boost the economy. Yet if this were
true, the record corporate proﬁts that we are
currently seeingwould be translating into jobs.

The fact of the matter is that we currently
live in a welfare state in which entitlements

are given to‘ people who don’t need them or '

deserve them. But I amby no means referring
to those on the lower end of the socioeconomic
spectrum. I am referring to that 1 percent on
top. The 1 percent that continuously under-
mines the verysidea of equal opportunity by
lobbyingfor subsidies fortheir alreadybloated
incomes and against any form of beneﬁts for

g low—income families.

They continuously argue that any form of
government dependence is bad for growth.
And Wall Street is right on this one: Their de-
pendence on our government is indeed bad
for growth. For instance, it is estimated that

corporate welfare costs the government about
$100 billion per year, and while this may be
positive for the growth of corporations, itis by
no means helpingto decrease the government
deﬁcit that everyone likes to talk about.

Furthermore, government subsidies are

given out with the intent that there will be
returns on the invesunent, such as jobs and
economic development. However, corpora-
tions are notorious for creatingj obs elsewhere
in order to save money and increase their own
proﬁts, while also seeking tax havens for the
same reason. Yet we continue to support this
deplorable behavior. .

Corporate elites continue topursue maxi-
mum proﬁts, even if it means eliminating the
rights of workers and consumers.

A_ good example of this is the corporate
crusade against raising the minimum wage.
Leading the charge in this case is Wal—Mart.
The average Wal—Mart employee makes an
average of $15,576 per yearwith meager ben-
eﬁts on top of that. This forces many Wal—Mart
workers to use government beneﬁts such as

"food stamps and Medicaid. So even though

the heirs to the Wal—Mart fortune are worth
$93 billion dollars, the average taxpayer is
paying for many Wal—Mart employees’ basic
necessities.

Inhisbook “Twilight of the Elites: America
After Meritocracy,” Christopher Hayes used
Major League Baseball as an analogy for this
situation. He compared steroid users to the
corporate elite, showing that the baseball
world is a lot like the business world. They

arebothsupercompetitiveenvironmentsthat ‘

breed people who are willingto do whatever it
takes to get ahead. Inbaseball, athletes cheated
nature byusingperformance—enhancingdrugs
in order to make themselves better players,
and in Wall Street, corporations cheatthe gov-
ernment and abuse labor in order to make
obscene amounts of money.

The MLB recovered by holding users ac-
countable and subsequentlypunishingthem.
The United States could learn somethingfrom
this: If we continue to allow corporations to do
whatever it takes to make a proﬁt, our meri-
tocracy may not be able to recover. I

the community about the role of health
care in the lives of artists.

From Chancellor’s Scholar to starv-
ing artist

As Sokolow sees it, her emergence as a
relevant political and artistic presence in
the local arts scene would probably never
have occurred without the University of
Pittsburgh’s decision to offer her a full-

ride scholarship. T

Sokolow grew up in the suburbs of H01-
mdel, N.]., an area that, according to So-
kolow, isn’t known for a robust arts scene.

“I grew up with everyone in my subur-
ban community kind of rolling their eyes
at the arts,” she said.

For this reason, she never saw pursuing
a future in a creative ﬁeld as a worthwhile
or pragmatic endeavor. But after receiv-
ing the University of Pittsburgh’s prized
Chancellor’s Scholarship, she felt far more
comfortable exploring her creative side.

Along with psychology, Sokolow began

It was this combination of psychology
and ﬁlm that eventually became the driv-

like the issue of mental health in creativity
and people who are kind of constructively
approaching the issues through art,” she
said.

After graduating, Sokolow found out
ﬁrsthand what being an independent artist
was all about as she began sustaining her-
self on freelance writing and ﬁlmmaking
gigs, largely sought out through Craigslist.
Though the gigs weren’t all ‘bad, they of-
fered none of the ﬁnancial stability of a
steady income.

Moreover, she realized that though
she was on her parents’ health insurance,
she would skip trips to the doctor just to
avoid the co—pays that, though small, could
threaten to destabilize her somewhat frag-
ile life as a freelancer.

“On a personal level that’s not healthy,
and on a systemic level that’s not healthy,”
she said.

Healthy Artists

Shortly after graduating and ﬁnding
herself in this situation, Sokolow began
attending the local meetings of Health
Care 4 All PA, an organization that has
been pushing for Pennsylvania to adopt a
single—payer health care system. She spent
time speaking with various members of
the organization, including Molly Rush,
the founder of the Thomas Merton Center.

“They were kind of like mentors to me,”
she said.

Sokolow began to realize that through
her work as a documentarian, she could
put a human face on health care while si-
multaneously creating a dialogue about
the health—care-related issues that inde-
pendent artists face every day.

In a survey conducted by the Artists
Health Insurance Resource Center and
published on Oct. 15 of this year, 43 per-
cent of artist respondents lacked health
insurance of any kind —— more than double
the statistic for the general populace.

Thus in 2011, Sokolow began work-
ing on a documentaryseries that proﬁled
different artists around the city of Pitts-
burgh, giving them a place to talk about
their work, their inspirations and their
struggles to ﬁnd aifordable health care.

The short pieces have proﬁled a range
of different independent artists, ranging
from comedians to poets and many in
between.

  Consistency from Patterson a must for Pitt

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

The game of college basketball doesn’t
rely solely on the play of seniors anymore.
Look no further than April’s National
Championship game between Michigan
and Louisville.

Ten players started in that game — ﬁve
on each side. Of those players, Peyton Siva
was the only senior to take the ﬂoor for
the game’s opening tip.

Pitt basketball’s fate in 2013-2014
could be decided by a pair of ﬁfth—year se-
niors, though. Lamar Patterson and Talib
Zanna are the only seniors on the team,
and their roles could be the most vital.

Recent history shows that the primary
concern for each player in approaching
this season should undoubtedly be receiv-

ing consistent production from these two
players — a dynamic that was reﬂected
in Pitt’s 84-52 win against Howard on
Sunday. /

Zanna led the team in scoring last sea-
son at the start of Big East play. He then
all bLt=‘ti;},.disappearejcl;,jduring conference
play, his scoring average plummeted
into single digits by-the end of the season.

And there he was on Sunday evening at
the Petersen Events Center against How-
ard, struggling against the Bison’s size at
the center position. That was head coach
Kevin Nickelberry’s plan from the start.

“We had to just battle him,” Nickel-
berry said. “We just wanted to use our
two-headed monster and try to get him
in foul trouble.”

The two-headed monster was 6-foot-9
Oliver Ellison and 6—foot—10 Marcel Boyd.

While Zanna played just six minutes in
the ﬁrst half, he scored only four points
on three shot attempts and recorded four
rebounds overall. '

The strategy made sense at the time,
but the ultimate impact on the game’s

result ranged from little to none. Nickel-
‘— berry later called the plan a “bad scout.”
After the 6-foot-9 center from Nigeria '1

posted a double-double of 19 points andA10
rebounds in his ﬁrst game against Fresno
State, Nickelberry wanted to put the onus
on Pitt’s guards. » .

“Bigs can’t beat us tonight,” Nickel-
berry told his team. “The guards have to
beat us. And their guards killed us.”

The effort on the perimeter was led by
Patterson, who scored 16 points in the ﬁrst
half alone while the Panthers turned in a
school-record 81 percent rate from the

ﬁeld in the half.

“Last game, we just couldn’t ﬁnd the
touch,” Patterson said. “Today, we found
it. That’s just how it is —— some games it
goes in, some games it doesn’t.”

That’s an understatement. Patterson
made his ﬁrst four 3-point attempts and
helped the Panthers carry a 24-point lead

“ into halftime, which allowed them to coast

to a— 84-52 victory.

Patterson ﬁnished with 20 points on
7—of-11 shooting, pulled in ﬁve rebounds
and dished out four assists.

Patterson now leads the Panthers in
both scoring and passing at 12.7 points
and six assists per game. He also pulls
in ﬁve rebounds per game, reﬂecting his
capabilities as a true triple-threat.

McConnell—Serio signs first recruiting class at Pitt

Dave Uhrmacher
‘Senior Stcyj” Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team received

four letters of intentfrom high school players‘

on Friday during the early college basketball
signing period. In her ﬁrst year at Pitt, head
coach Suzie McConnel1—Serio’s ﬁrst recruiting
class consists of Naje Gibson, Yacine Diop,
Stasha Carey and Aysia Bugg. ‘

As of now, Pitt’s recruiting class is ranked
No. 15 in the nation by Blue Star Basketball
and ESPNW’s HoopGurlz.

“This is an amazing ‘group of young
women, on and off the basketball court,”
McConnell—Serio said. “We are very excited,
as this is our ﬁrst recruiting class at Pitt, and
we are conﬁdent that theywill make an impact
on our program. We are looking forward to
seeing this special group — together — in
Pitt uniforms next fall.”

Seton—LaSalle (Pa.) High School team-
mates Naje Gibson and Yacine Diop, ranked
No. 59 and No. 84 in the nation, respectively,
lead the highest-ranked recruit class in Pitt

Mcconnell-Serio’s first recruiting class has received national acclaim.

women’s basketball history. Each player is a
member of the ESPN HoopGurlz’s 100 best
players in the Class of 2014.

Gibson, a 6-foot guard,_ received a grade
of 95 from ESPN and is the nation’s No.
11-ranked backcourt player. Diop is also a
guard at 5-fo ot-10 and commits to Pitt ranked

. No. 16 at her position. -

With the two players leading the recruit-

I ing class, head coach Suzie McConnell—Serio

already has a pair of guards that should an-
chor the Panthers from the backcourt in the
near ﬁxture.

4 According to ESPN, the Pitt recruiting
class sits as the 15th best in the nation. The
only Atlantic Coast Conference foes listed
ahead of Pittsburgh are traditional powers
Duke, N otre Dame and Virginia.

Forward Stasha Carey, the nation’s No.
12—ranked post player and No. 90 overallinthe
class of 2014, comes in as the only frontcourt
player in the class.

Bolingbrook, Ill., guard Aysia Bugg rounds
out the ﬁrst-ever class for McConnell-Serio
at Pitt. I

Patterson’s 20 points led Pitt to victory Sunday. Ben Brownlee | Senior Staff Photographer

<1 FROM PAGE 9

FATE   N

But questions of consistency also surround
the extent to which Patterson can lead
Pitt on a game-by—game basis. Take, for
instance, his 22 points against Marquette
onjan. 12 last season, which were followed
by only ﬁve points in the next contest at
Villanova onjan. 16.

Patterson is a patient player, but his
decision-making can be maddening at
times, especially when he passes up open
looks on the perimeter in order to pen-

etrate or continue moving the basketball.
It’s even moremaddeningwhen one hears
the way his teammates discuss his scoring
prowess. , -

“Lamar Patterson can score the ball,”
backcourt-mate Cameron Wright said. “I
see it every day.”

Not to say it’s expected Patterson can
throw up a 20-5-4 lineevery single time
he plays, but does he think he can be the
all—around threat he’s shown he can be on
a consistent basis? “

“Yeah, I’m a versatile player,” Patterson
said. “I like to show different aspects of my
game every time out.” §
