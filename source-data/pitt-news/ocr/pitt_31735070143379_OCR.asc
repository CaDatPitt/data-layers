If the,White House allows it, local
oﬁicials would like to hold part of the
Group of 20 summit on Pitt’s campus

The event, during which leaders
from 19 nations and the EU will discuss
ways to promote economic develop-
ment, will be hdd ir1 Pittsburgh Sept 24
and 25.

Bill Flanagan, an executive Vice pres-
ident of one of the groups  to
coordinate the summit, said it was too
eariytostartpinningdownthe details of

could host G720

the event;

Right now, he said, members of the ’

Pittsburgh G-20 Partnership, the group
of businesses and government oﬁcials
organizingpthe conference, are simply
collecting ideas for the summit; The
White House will determine its ﬁnal
schedule
But Flanagan said he was sure he’d
like to see it come to campus
‘ County ofﬁcials have noted in news
releases severaltimesthatpartof the
reason Pittsburgh was chosen for the
summit was because of its transforma-
tion from a steel—rnill—c0vered city into

- a center for education and medical re-

search. .
Kevin Evanto, a spokesman for

Allegheny County Chief Executive

Dan Onorato, said earlier in the week,

“Oakland is one of the areas thatwill ;

be highlighted,” atleast during the sum-
mit.’s planning process, if not  the
actual event
“Oakland’s the cultural and educa-
tional center [of the city],” he said 0
University oﬂicials declined to com-
ment on Pitfs preparations for the G—2O
summit earlier this week, saying they
were still too early in the planning. pro-

ind Marine uses tongue device to ‘see’

by Lindsay Carroll
Aaaziita/It New E95/‘or

Cpl. Mike jernigan has a cool pair of sun-
glasses

They complement his sharply pressed
black uniform, which is covered with badges
and decorations. They also help him see

The retired Marine, who lost his sight
while ﬁghting in Iraq, sported his shades for
an audience at a news conference Thursday
morning.

He scanned white paper shapes that re-
tired Maj. Gen. Gale Pollock attached to black

posterboard and methodically moved his head
up and down.

“Mike, what do you see?” Pollock asked.

jernigan paused. Then, he conﬁdently
pointed his right arm to the right; He saw a
downward-pointed arrow, and he saw it with
his tongue.

The pair of sunglasses — a device called
the BrainPort, made by Wicab Inc — had a
camera attached to the middle of the frames.

The camera transmitted images through
a wire onto a small panel upon which Jemi-
gan placed his tongue Tiny electrodes rose
on the panel in accordance with the de-

grees of light reﬂected by the image.

After training with a UPMC team,]ernigan
learned how to read the electrodes’ signals.
Pollock said the signals feel like champagne
bubbles to testers.

\W~hen_]ernigan removed his sunglasses, the
audience: could see where his eyes used to be.
His left eye was pasted shut, and his right eye
was slit to reveal the blackness behind the lid.

In August of 2004, Jernigan was on pa-
trol in Mahmudiyah, located in Iraq’s Anbar
province, when a roadside bomb blew up his
Humvee. V

Heiwoke up in a hospital bed. The doc-
tors reconstructed his right hand, removed the
shrapnel in his left knee and put:  acrylic plate
 forehead because his skullhad caved in.

When-he awoke, Jernigan realized he had
lost his eyes.

“I returned from Iraq, and they gave me a
stick,”l1e said. “I felt my life was over.”

Five years later, the 30-year-old corporal v

started testing new products with the Center
of Vision Restoration at UPMC, whichheld
the news conference along with Pitt to an-

nounce a $3 million donation ﬁom retired"

merchant and Pitt alumnus, Louis Fox.

Fox, who lost much of his eyesight during
the past 10 years because "of a rare retinal dis-
ease, donated the money after hearing about
the center’s work. Because of Fox’s donation,
the center, which researches cures and theta-'
pies for blindness, will be renamed after him.

Fox, who earned his bachelor’s degree at
Pitt, said not  able to diive, fly and see his
family without difﬁcultly felt overwhelming.

Pollock, the executive director of the Cen-
ter of Vision Restoration, said 80 percent of
those with vision loss suffer from chronic de-
pression.

jernigan said he owes a lot of his hope to
rehabilitation. Now a student at Georgetown
University, he recently married.

He’s never seen his wife or his stepson, but
he said the BrainPort can help him “see” the
outlines of the faces and bodies of his family.

“I was a hard charger,” he said. “I volun-
teered for this job. I knew the risk I took.”

oess.

Flanagan said Pitt students will be able to vol-
unteer to help prepare for the summit, most 
by cleaning up the city. He added that the summit
could provide them with an opportunity to learn
about international economics

Even if the summit doesn’t come to Oakland,
he said, it should “put on quite a show” as the thou-
sands of visitors try to make their way 
Pittsburgh

Last night; the University hosted the partner-
 third public brainstorming session, during
which Pittsburgh residents shared their ideas for
welcoming the world leaders and 2,000 to 3,000

' expected journalists

Many of the 200 or so people gathered in the
Connolly Ballroom in Alumni Hall gave sugges-
tions  scope and level of seriousness

Some local business owners promoted their

 offering to donate candy to the diplomats

or proposing that they use their iickshaws to avoid
gridlock and help save the environment

Several people said they were concerned that
the city needed to be cleaned before the summit.

One woman offered to organize a clean-up ef-
fort,-while another suggested that the city try to be
environmentally ﬁiendly by  G-20 members
and their entourage pitchers of water instead of
water bottles i

Others said theywere concerned about the pr»
tential for iiots, whichhave occurredatmany previ-
ous G-20 summits.

One man suggested that local oﬂicials should
pay to have people who protested duting the last
summit, in London, fly to Pittsburgh These people,
he said, could teach police  in Pitjsburgh
how to most effectively work with protesters

Another person suggested that the city hold a .

referendum to see whether Pittsburgh residents re-
ally want to hold the G-20, or whether it’s simply
something  promoted by businesses and spe-
cial interest groups

Many people also expressed concem that Pitts-
bunghers won’t know what the G-20 is and will thus
embarrass the city.

One woman suggested  60second
time slots on the nightly news to explain what the
summit is and what city residents should 
These announcdnents, she said, could run during
the weeks leading up to the summit -

Another person said he’d like to see students
from local universities create presentations explain-
ingwhat the G-20 is and present them to local el-
ementary school, middle school and  school
students

Table games diceyi
gamble for the city

’ like

Pennsylvania’s legislators are

A anteing up.

On June l7 State Rep. Bill
DeWeese, D-Greene, introduced
a bill to legalize table games in
casinos. The move would cre-
ate lucrative . ﬁscal beneﬁts for
Pennsylvania, but residents could
face social hazards like gambling
addiction, especially college stu-
dents.

With a recession festering
across the country, states are
scrambling to compensate for
projected budget deﬁcits. The

Pennsylvania’s existing casi-
nos — which currently offer slot
machines, horse racing and com-
puterized card games —— gener-
ated almost $10O million in tax
revenue during May 2009 alone,
according to the Pennsylvania
Gaming Control Board.‘ Table
games could produce hundreds
of millions more every year.
Stagnant and declining in-
comes of residents ensure that
any other tax hike would face
even harsher opposition than
usual. Skimming casino proﬁts is
a popular way to generate much-
needed funds, and table games

of casinos create thousands of
jobs. _

However, the whole plan is a
crapshoot. Casinos sometimes
bring costly societal problems,
gambling addiction and
heightened crime rates, to the
communities they inhabit. “Any
time you have more legalized

lems,T’ said Jody Bechtold, ﬁeld

and police. ‘
Students could be especially
susceptive to these threats. Pitts-
burgh is getting a casino in Au-

card games with dealers in place
of machines entice a younger
crowd. Instead of pulling levers
by themselves, gamblers!" could

play with another person. Bech-

told said, “The table games have
been known to attract college stu-
dents more than slots.”

There’s nothing wrong with
moderated gambling, and Penn-
sylvania needs to compete with
neighboring states —— freewheel-
ing Pitt students can already take
a road—trip to West Virginia for
table games — but Pitt will need
to prepare for more gambling ad-
dicts in its student populace.

The University ' already pro-

Pittsburgh is in the midst of a re-

bling, nor can it allow a vibrant
city to degenerate into the worst
stereotypes of the Jersey shore.

Education ‘ about potential
problems will help students avoid
losing tuition money to the house
in a desperate bid to reclaim lost
assets. The money wagered by
gamblers didn’t materialize, and
it isn’t necessarily expendable.
Bettors divert those funds from
other investments. Hopefully,
Oakland businesses don’t lose an
income to the allure of the card

GM failure proves gov't

unable to handle health care  

by Giles Howard

Colummltt

 

. The nation’s media has meticu-
lously recorded the material effects
of the recession on Americans, as
journalists search for alternately
depressing and uplifting stories
across the country. '

While these material stones of
immediate economic hardship are
the most emotionally evocative,
the recession’s impact on our na-
tion’s ideological disposition will be
far more lasting than the material
setbacks of today. A

Rasmussenreportscom pub-
lished a poll in April that examined
the ideological impacts of the re-
cession.

It said, “Only 53 percent of
American adults believe capitalism
is better than socialism.”

According to the study, 20
percent of surveyed adults in the

United States believe socialism is
better and another 27 percent are
unsure. Though inconclusive, the
poll indicates that the recession has
tarnished capitalism’s public image
and prompted some Americans to
seek a new direction.

While the recession has shaken
some Americans’ faith in the free
market, I experienced a somewhat
different ideological revelation as a
result of our latest economic cri-
sis.

Before the recession, I was an
ardent socialist. Committed to
the far left of American politics, I
dreamt of an America governed by
European social-democratic ideals
in which health care was universal
and the government directed the
economy for the betterment of
society.

Today, as I stare into the abyss
that is President Barack Obama’s
plan for the “betterment” of soci-

ety, I recoil from the ideals I once
held. For although I was a ﬁrm
socialist, my political identiﬁca-
tion has always been informed by
a belief in an America in which
competence and intellect com-
mand success. I turned to social-
ism as a logical aspiration when it
appeared that global capitalism was

‘an impediment to this belief ’s re-

alization.

Yet, where I once saw the
downtrodden majority as a res-
ervoir of potential and untapped
ability, the recession, its causes and
the public’s reaction to the crisis
have proved me wrong.

For instance, it bafﬂes me that

so many Americans signed ad-

justable rate mortgages without
understanding the terms of the
loan —- that they then sought the‘
intervention of the government to
cushion the blow of their own ig-
norance. It’s shameful.

Whereas I believed in necessary

made little sense to me. The com-

The recession could have been
a positive turning point in U.S. his-

our economic woes as a nation. We
could have turned around our na-

our means. Instead, the American

pany’s bureaucracy and its union
workers have consistently failed to
modernize and become profitable.
The government’s intervention
has only harmed private investors
and left both the bureaucracy and
union in control, even giving the
UAW a 17.5 percent stake in the
corporation.

Tyingibillions of taxpayer dol-
lars to a failing company to pre-
serve the outmoded jobs of con-
stituents proved the government’s
inability to intervene competently
in the economy. For this reason, I
cannot support the planned inter-

But in dealing with the new Amer-

ideology and political alignment.

I realized that more important
than any prior political’identiﬁca-

Pope said the band does not play

playing in the ideal location for a band

“The weather is great and basi-

Besides the gorgeous weather,
the physical steel and concrete of the

however, are a vital part of the song-

chocolate, fruit, sprinkles, cereal and
nuts on top that make it a customized

The yogurt comes in original and
the sweeter honeydew ﬂavors Both
have a smooth consistency reminis-
cent of soft serve ice cream.

Sweet Berry boasts 16 toppings,
including strawberries, kiwi, pineap-
ple, almond slices, raspberries, blue-
berries, chocolate chips, Fruity Peb-
bles and cut-up mochi — ajapanese
doughy rice cake — but I counted
only 13. ‘

Though a cohort of mine said

frozen nonfat yogurt, branch owner
Sung Park said

“It is sweeter and has less calories
than Pinkberry,” he said.

But how?

“That’s our secret,” Park said.

One hundred  of the origi-
nal ﬂavor, the size of a small order,
will only weigh you down 89 calories,
15 grams of sugar and 19 grams of
carbohydrates The yogurt is naturally
fat free, too. .

Park said his shop is part of a na:

tionwide franchise, but many of the

stores aren’t called Sweet Berry.
This Sweet Berry is the first one
in Pennsylvania, and an employee at

the store said Park chose the location ,

on Meyran Avenue because Oakland
is the first place that many out-of-
town college students familiar with
Pinkberry see in Pittsburgh.

In addition to frozen yogurt,
Sweet Berry offers fruit smoothies
and Seattie’s Best Coffee. There are
only a few smoothie options listed,
but the employees will happily make

personal blends The strawberry
smoothie is juice-based and doesn’t
taste as heavy or sweet as many other
smoothies .

Unfortunately, there is only one
size, which is roughly the same as a
medium at a coffee shop.

Park said a lot of young women
prefer frozen yogurt as a healthier al-
ternative to ice cream or a specialty
drink at a coffee shop

Considering that a small frozen
yogurt with three toppings costs
$4.50, the price is about the same

Sweet Berry offers a delicious way
to extend a date, so long as you get in
the door before 9:30 p.m. But try to
plan your visit earlier to get a larger,
fresher choice of toppings

The environment is clean and
open, decorated with ﬂowers on the
walls" and tables There’s seating on
high chairs for eight But that won’t
be necessary, because you’ll probably
scarf down your treat before your
tush hits the seat:

Pinkberry, eat your tart heart out.

Ex-Panthers   prepare for Draft
Blair 4563.4 pow/13.4 to éooat Mock

by Alex Oltmanns
Staﬂ U7/iter

Anyone looking for Dejuan
Blair in the NBA next year might
not recognize him at ﬁrst glance.

In preparation for the June
25th Draft, the former Pitt star
has slimmed down considerably
and is looking lean and more trim.
With his playing weight from last
season at around 300 pounds,
Blair shed a good chunk of that
body fat to drop down to roughly
275 pounds.When Blair declared
for the NBA Draft in the spring,
there were some that questioned
his decision, citing the fact that his
projected rnid-to—late ﬁrst round
Draft selection did not merit

but I don’t think he will,” Walters
said.

Blair lost the weight because
of a change in his diet, Walters
said. _

“As a student you don’t neces-
sarily eat the best,” Walters said.
“But once he gotdown to IMG
Academy in Florida and work-
ing out a couple times a day and
eating right, the weight just came
off.”

By losing the weight, Blair qui-
eted a lot of concerns that those
teams may have had about his ﬁt-

ness. .
“He helped himself immense-
ly by losing weight because one
of the questions teams had about
him was his weight‘ and condition-

Mock drafts predict that DeJuan Blair will be a top-20 Draft pick.

leaving school early. But with the
weight loss, Blair is shooting up

V Draft boards and showing that

his decision to leave school early
made sense after all.

“There’s been a bunch of
teams looking at me,” Blair said,
naming the Phoenix Suns," Chi-
cago Bulls, Milwaukee Bucks, At-
lanta Hawks and Indiana Pacers
as some of the teams he’s been in
contact with. ,

Numerous mock-Drafts have
Blair going to the Indiana Pacers
at No. 13, the Chicago Bulls at
No. 16 and the New Jersey Nets
at No. 11.

Happy Walters, Blair’s agent,
said that all the teams picking

from No. 9 down into the twen-

ties have shown interest in Blair.
“Teams later in the first round
would love for him to get there,

But it’s not only a tinier Blair

that has teams in the middle of .

the ﬁrst round considering draft-
ing the All—American. Teams like

Indiana and New Jersey are in"
p desperate need of strong big men

who can haul in rebounds. Blair is
that player.

Last year_ he averaged 15.7
points and 12.3 rebounds :1 game,
including a little more than ﬁve
offensive rebounds per game,
which was second best in the
country. Blair also led the coun-

Goalie hired  

to be new 
assistant

by Lauren Kirschman A
Staff [Writer ..;r_

Pitt men’s soccer coach Joe
Luxbacher recently named for-
mer goalkeeper Eric Barnes grad-
uate assistant and goalkeepers’
coach.

Barnes, who is currently a Pitt
law student, played his last two
seasons with the Panthers after
transferring from George Mason
University in Virginia.

This isn’t Barnes’s ﬁrst coach;
ing experience, though. He said
he worked with local club teams
while at George Mason. He also
plans on continuing his playing
career with the Pittsburgh Riv-
erhounds of the United Soccer
Leagues Second Division.

“I’ve been coaching for prob-
ably four or ﬁve years, and I was
part of the team the last two
years, so it kind of made sense to
stay on the coaching staff if they
wanted me,” Barnes said. “I ac-
tually started in January training
the goalkeepers because we didn’t
have a goalkeeper coach my last
year on the team.”

While at Pitt, Barnes collected
six wins and two shuts outs and
ﬁnished with a 1.42 goals-against
average and 88 saves.

“He’s a self-starter,” Lux-
bacher said. “He’s always work-

ing. He’s a good guy and he’s 

excellent example because he’s a
hard worker, a self—motivated guy,
and he knows the position.”

Before becoming 21 Pan-
ther, Barnes played two years at
George’ Mason, where he had 2
0.99 goals-against average and
a .808 save percentage. In 2006,
Barnes earned the Martin Dun-
phy Goalkeeper of the Year
Award, which is George Mason’s
yearly award for the best goalten'5
der on the team.

Luxbacher said it’s important
for the team to have one coach
who works with the goalies for a
few different reasons.

“It’s necessary to have a 
who works with the goalkeep-
ers everyday, not just physically,

but psychologically,” Luxbacher said. “He
knows the rigors and he knows what they
go through.” ,
Barnes said his Pitt playing experience
is helpful, because he can prepare the goal-
keepers for Big East conference play.
“I know the returning goalkeeper [Zack

Matthews], and I know what he needs to‘

work on in order to succeed in the Big
East,” Barnes said.

Luxbacher said Barnes was a natural
choice because of his attention to detail and

the training he put in on his own time while
he was a player. He said he looks for those
qualities in both players and coaches.

Barnes said he hopes to help the players
on the ﬁeld, as well as off it.

“I’m deﬁnitely younger than the rest of
thc coaching staff, so maybe I can relate to
[the players] more,” Barnes said. “It’s deﬁ-
nitely a» balance between being the coach
and being there for whatever other issues
come up with the players.”

Pitt linebacker reinstated to
team after charges dropped

by Jay Huerbin
Sparta E3itor

Pitt senior linebacker Adam Gunn has
been reinstated to the football
team the same day charges against
him were dropped. Gunn was
suspended indeﬁnitely on May
13 following an incident outside
Club Zen in Station Square.

Gunn was arrested and ar-

on May 10, according to court
documents. He was charged with
two misdeméanor offenses ——
for resisting arrest and failure to
disperse — and two summary of-
fenses — for disorderly conduct
and public drunkenness.

His preliminary hearing was
held today and all charges were
withdrawn.

No ofﬁcial statement from
Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt
was released, but an athletic department
spokesperson said Gunn “was fully rein-
stated to the team” on Wednesday

Gunn was a ﬁfth—year senior last season.

He was injured in the ﬁrst game against ‘

Bowling Green, but was awarded a sixth
year of eligibility. His  tackles in 2007
were the third best on the team.
He graduated in 2008 with
a degree in communication and
rhetoric and is currently enrolled
A in Pitt’s Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs.
Gunn was the fourth Panther
in roughly a month to get into
trouble. Receiver T.]. Porter and
. defensive lineman Tommie Du-N
hart were suspended from the
‘team in April and announced
that they would transfer from
Pitt.
Sophomore rcceiverjonathan
Baldwin was arrested April 19,
but no disciplinary action by the

Baldwin’s preliminary, hearing is
set for June 30. He is charged
with one misdemeanor offense for inde-
cent assault and two summary offenses for
harassment and disorderly conduct. 1

so many of them,” Blair said. “I
think I did pretty good against
them and it showed.”

Weight wasn’t the only concern
about Blair coming into the Draft.
Blair is only 6 feet 5 inches tall.

Whﬂe in college he faced gen-
erally smaller opponents that he
could bully around, in the NBA
practically every power forward
will have a few inches on Blair.

Conversely, Blair has a 7-foot—2

wingspan, so his long reach should
help make up for lack of height.

That combined with his lower
weight, which makes him a bit
quicker, is how Blair plans on
matching up against larger play-
ers.

Even with all the questions
concerning how Blair will match
up against the larger players in the
NBA, he showed during his time

-in the Big East he can play in an

extremely physical environment
and compete against larger play-
ers. _

Against Connecticut’s
Hasheem Thabeet, who is
7—foot-2, Blair put up 22 points
and 23 rebounds in Pitt’s win over
the Huskies on Feb. 16. Against
Luke Harangody of Notre Dame,
who is 6—foot—8 and 240 pounds,
Blair had 23 points and 22 re-
bounds on 31.

“In college Dejuan shower-he
that’s the kind of player he is, a
tough aggressive rebounder and
defender,” Walters said. “A lot

of teams are looking for that and

they see him bringing that right
away from day one.” «-3
Blair echoed those sentiments
saying, “Playing in the Big East
has deﬁnitely prepared me a lot
because of the physicaiity and ev—
erything that comes with it.”

Dejuan Blair said “That toughness, that’s what the

The Toronto Raptors were  to measure
Young’s vertical leap at a workout in rnid—May. As
Young  toward the vertical—leap pole, he
caught himself on a knob and a screwwas impaled
in Young’s arm .

Young needed to go to the hospitalwhere he said
the stat? “drugged me up and got the screw out.”

if he went to thejazz at the 20th overall pid<.

Along with toughness, Young’s work ethic
