Gammage trial draws
a crowd of protesters

Mwwﬁs

A group of over 100 people
gathered downtown at the City-
County Building steps on Saturday
to protest the ongoing injustices
occurring in the trial of three police
officers involved in the death of
motorist Jonny Gammage.

Gammage, 3 I, died last October
of asphyxiation due to compression
of the chest and neck after being
pulled over by Brentwood police for
a traffic violation. The trial of the
officers abruptly halted last week
and was declared a mistrial after
testimony from County Coroner
Cyril Wecht violated the defen-
dants’ rights to a fair trial.

National and community leaders
participating in the “Justice for
Jonny” rally spoke to the racially
diverse crowd about the pervasive
problem civil rights abuses have

 

recently become, highlighting sepa-
rate cases from across the country
and across races.

“Cops aren’t supposed to be the
judge, jury, and executioner,” blast-
ed Mauri Saalakhan, head of the

Coalition Against Political
Imprisonment and National
Association of Police

Accountability in Washington. D.C.
Along with his demands for
increased accountability in police
action, Saalakhan urged all univer-
sities to join forces in voting by vot-
ing for change.

Saalakhan and other rally
speakers called for Common Pleas
Judge David R. Cashman to excuse
himself based on Saturday’s Post-
Gazette article which claimed he
allowed jurors in the Gammage case
to to meet privately with defense
attorneys and without the prosecu-
tor, shortly after he declared a mis-

Nordenberg updates
trustees on Pitt’s progress

 

It looks like Pitt is making some
progress.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
presented his report and the status
report on trustee position statements

to the Board of Trustees last
Thursday.

The mission of the University of
Pittsburgh has been to aggressively
pursue excellence in undergraduate
education, to partner in community
development, and to maintain excel-
lence in research. The operation
goals have been to secure an ade-
quate resource base and ensure oper-
ational efficiency and effectiveness.

Chancellor Nordenberg reported
that academic standards are up, with
admission up 14 percent, and he said
that the average SAT score for enter-
ing freshmen is up five points. The
percentage of entering freshmen in
the top 10 percent of their high
school classes is up to 25 percent.

Related to academic excellence

is the Honors College, which this
year has recruited Chancellor’s
Scholars from eight states and one
from Romania. Eleven were selected
from over 300 applicants.

Other initiatives to improve the
quality of student life include plans
to increase the number of tutors,
increase the amount of recreation
space in Bellefield Hall, and develop
living/leaming units in the dorms.
Vice Provost Jack Daniel is also
looking into existing programs to
facilitate the academic success of
minorities and plans to have a report
to the provost by March of 1997.

With regards to community
development, the trustees were
given a list of public service projects
designed to aid the well-being of the
community. Also, good relations
with the mayor and county commis-
sioners were cited as a sign of
progress in this area.

Chancellor Nordenberg said that
he would continue to push for the

CMU and Pitt ROTC march
in honor of fallen comrade

rc Nuzzo

     

ROTC cadets and midshipmen
dedicated their second annual fall
semester parade to a fallen brother—in-
arms on the campus of Carnegie
Mellon University last Friday.

The grieving parents and ﬁancee of
First Lieutenant Arthur J. Schnieder
watched as their loved one was hon-
ored. Schnieder, a 1993 University of
Pittsburgh graduate and Navy ROTC
alumnus, died in a tragic training
mishap at the Marine Corps’ Camp
LeJeune this past summer.

On May 10, 1996, the helicopter in
which Schnieder was riding collided
with another helicopter during a rou-
tine early morning aerial training
assault mission. The collision killed all
14 military personnel on board.

Because Schnieder was a member
of the Pitt/CMU community, the event

brought home the dangers of military .

service to the members of the respec-
tive ROTC units.

“It does make you think about
what the future may hold [as a military
ofﬁcerl,” said NROTC midshipman
Kevin Hoffman.

Many of the Air Force cadets also
felt the harsh impact of Schnieder’s
death.

‘‘It sunk in, and we realized this
lieutenant was just like one of us sitting
here today. Maybe a few years in the
future, something like this could hap-
pen to us,” said Ken Knight, a cadet
lieutenant colonel.

The ROTC units, which conduct a
joint parade each fall and spring
semester, chose to dedicate this year's
fall parade to their former comrade.
The units draw their membership from
both Camegie Mellon’s and Pitt’s stu-
dent bodies.

The Navy ROTC unit has a Marine
option, which is what Lt. Schnieder
graduated from. The Marine and Navy
options work together under the single
title of NROTC.

“The midshipmen came to us and
requested that they dedicate this parade
to the lieutenant.” said NROTC Marine
Officer Instructor Major Susan
Fonteno. “They are very proud.”

The midshipmen raised enough
money to install a bronze memorial
plaque in their headquarters office in
Hamburg Hall on CMU’s campus.

YOKOSUKA, Japan — A ﬁve—year—old
American boy’s death has unexpectedly
made him a hero in Japan. His kidneys were
transplanted to two Japanese youths, one 9,
the other 19, saving their lives.

His case has prompted a group of 4,000
Japanese doctors, tired of Japanese 1awrnak—
ers’ rcfusal to permit surgeons to take organs
from brain-dead patients, to make cases like
the boy’s death the rule, rather than the
exception.

Japan stands apart from almost every
other advanced country with its refusal to
legally recognize brain death, banning heart
transplants, and most liver and lung trans-
plants, which roquire a donor whose heart is
still beating. The Washington Post

Candidate's forum features womenﬁ issues

Gbk'

   

 

Political junkies could get a
quick fix in the engineering
building last Thursday.

The National Women’s
Student Coalition, along with
the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action
League of Pennsylvania and the
CWO, hosted a candidates’
forum in the Benedum
Engineering Hall. The forum
featured such speakers as
Kathy Matta, a Republican run-
ning for the Pennsylvania State
Senate, Lynn Irwin, Ellen
Lebee, who spoke on behalf of
Joe Kohn, the Democratic can-
didate for State Attorney
General, and Jaime Rooney,
who spoke for Bill Coyne,
Democratic U.S. Congressman.

The forum emphasized
women’s issues, primarily
those of reproductive rights,
and therefore concentrated on
those candidates who hold
strong pro-choice views and
voting records.

As Heather Anderson of
NARAL-PA said early in the
program, “We felt the need to

give college students a chance
to meet the pro-choice candi-
dates running for election and
to find out about their positions
— just to, in general, educate
college students.”

Matta. a Republican who
ran for mayor of Pittsburgh in
l993 and who is currently run-
ning for a seat in the State
Senate, said that while women
comprise 54 percent of the pop-
ulation in Pennsylvania, their
voices are not being heard.

“I believe the issues that
deal with women should not be
decided with a plurality of men
in the Pennsylvania House and
Senate,” said Matta. “It’s been a
long, hard struggle because
many people still do not want to
vote for and elect women. We
have to look at the people run-
ning and see what they stand
for.”

Lynn Irwin, a volunteer on
the Kohn campaign, added to
Matta’s strong stance on abor-
tion rights for women by call-
ing for voters to support those
candidates who have shown
consistent pro-choice stances
throughout their political
career. Irwin stressed the fact

K Manu talks to Pin
students about women’s issues.

that Kohn’s opponent, Mike
Fisher, is a staunch advocate of
the pro—life movement, while
Kohn has been an active sup-
porter of reproductive rights for
the last decade.

“Joe Kohn is someone in
Harrisburg who will make sure
that Pennsylvania women have
the choice to do what they want

with their pregnancy,” stated
Irwin. She also emphasized
Kohn’s interest in pursuing
women’s issues by strengthen-
ing those laws that prohibit
domestic violence and force
deadbeat dads to pay up.

Jaime Rooney, coordinator
for the Bill Coyne re-election
campaign, contributed to the
forum by saying, “Bill Coyne is
the only Western Pennsylvania
legislator who has consistently
voted pro—choice.” Rooney stat-
ed that Pennsylvania is one of
the most restrictive states in the
country when dealing with
abortion laws, and he encour-
aged women to voice their
opposition by voting for those
candidates who seek to change
that statistic.

“A woman’s right to
choose is a woman’s right to
choose. It should not have any-
thing to do with politics,” said
Rooney, “It is interesting to
note that we continually face
opponents who claim that they
don’t want government in our
lives, and yet they allow the
government to get involved in
the most private parts when
dealing with issues such as

abortion.”

The candidates’ forum was
part of a larger picture the
CWO sought to bring attention
to on Thursday. October 24 was
a day marked in honor of a
woman by the name of Rosie
Jimenez, a working mother
who couldn’t afford to have
another child and who was
forced to undergo an illegal
abortion in 1977. She became
the first woman to die of an ille-
gal abortion as a result of the
Hyde Amendment which
stopped Medicaid funding for
abortions.

According to Laura
Baldwell, CWO publicity coor-
dinator, this day was originally
started to commemorate
Jimenez’s death and focus on
abortion rights, but now has
evolved to encompass all
women’s issues, issues of
which voters should be aware.

“We wanted to take this
day one step further towards
voter education,” said
Baldwell, “and give the stu-
dents an idea of which candi-
dates supported women’s issues
and who they could vote for in
the upcoming elections.”

Mexico is not only a Cancun get—away
for spring break—crazed college students. It
can also be a great place to learn and prac-
tice newly acquired Spanish skills as some
of Pitt’s study abroad engineering students
did this past summer.

The students arrived in Monterrey,
Mexico on June 6 and stayed until July 19.

Monterrey is an highly industrial cen-
ter of Mexico, located in the northern part
of the country and home to “the Tec” (a.k.a.
Monterrey Institute of Technology).

The 14 students took a six—credit,
intensive Spanish course, which lasted four
hours a day, Monday through Friday.

_ 'l'l'lE PITT NEWS

Differences in attitudes about school
became apparent to the Americans as they
got integrated into the system.

“I think the Mexicans were more
straightforward about their expectations,”
said industrial engineering student Cathy
Bienkowski. “They told us right away that
we should put aside one hour of studying
for every credit hour we take.”

Mexican professors were not prepared
to slow down their curriculum for the
American students either, according to
industrial engineering student Adam
Kucia.

“The teacher didn’t speak any English
during the lessons —— until we had the
blankest looks on our faces,” he said.
“They were also pretty strict about atten-

dance. You were only allowed to miss
about three classes; otherwise you don’t get
the credit.”

The group also experienced the typical
“culture shock” as they entered into the
Mexican culture.

“Because blond hair is unusual in
Mexico, people would just outright stare. It
was a little weird,” said Bienkowski.

The relations between the social class-
es in Mexico were also a surprise to Kucia.

“The social classes don’t want any-
thing to do with each other,” he said. “I
should say the rich doesn’t want anything
to do with the poor. The poor think that the
rich are corrupt. I also found it shocking
that what I spend on a meal at McDonald’s
in the U.S. is a poor Mexican’s daily

salary.”

Junior engineering student Dawn
Shehee recalled little girls on the streets try-
ing to sell gum to tourists to make money.

“I guess I realized that Mexico really is
a third world country,” she said.

Both Bienkowski and Shehee noticed
a difference in the Mexicans’ attitudes
towards women.

“Females are inferior compared to
men,” Shehee said. “Men just don’t swear
around women, and it’s really bad if a girl
says a bad word.”

However, Bienkowski said chivalry
still plays a large part in the culture of
males.

“The Mexican men were either perfect
gentlemen or they thought that all
American girls would be easy,” said
Bienkowski. “Many of the guys I met
insisted on opening doors for me, and when
I opened it myself, one asked, ‘Why do you
keep opening the door — I’ll do it.’ It was
kind of nice.”

Kucia found the Mexican students and
citizens to be very receptive to the
American culture, too.

“At the Tec they were nice. They real-
ly took care of us. The very few bad expe-
riences I had were simply Mexicans dri-
ving past on the streets screaming ‘gringo,’
which means ‘American,’ at me.”

The three engineers also sensed that
they had a different perspective after hav-
ing spent six weeks in Monterrey.

“I definitely sensed how it feels to be
discriminated against, even though it was
just people just making snide comments
about my being American,” said Kucia.

Shehee said she received quite a dif-
ferent reception.

“I felt proud to be American. When
someone found out that I was American,
they were impressed. I also realized how
much I have as an American,” said Shehee.

Bienkowski sensed a difference in the
attitudes and knowledge about foreign lan-
guages between Mexico and the U.S.

“I felt that there was a language barri-
er for me, but I always managed to ﬁnd
someone who could speak at least a little
English,” she said. “Whereas here in the
U.S., I don’t think a Spanish—speaking per-
son could easily ﬁnd someone to speak
Spanish with.”

All three enthusiastically agreed that
the experience was a worthwhile one.

“It was a total learning experience,”
said Bienkowski. “It’s also good for a
resume. It shows employers that you’re
willing to try something new, and that
you’re not afraid to go to a different part of
the world.”

Shehee said the trip helped expose the
cultural differences between the two coun-
tries.

“It really showed me the differences
between people,” she said. “It was amazing
to me that someone born at the same time
asIwascouldbesodifferent.IguessI
became more culturally aware.”

Students can look forward to friend-
lier, more efficient service from Pitt’s
Van-Call system, according to an
announcement made at last week’s
Student Government Board meeting.

Recently, students complained to the
SGB that Van—Call drivers and dispatch-
ers were rude and the service was too
slow.

In response to complaints, SGB and
the Department of Parking and
Transportation are putting a third van into
service, upgrading the telephone system
to record all calls, and conducting a sur-
vey of riders.

The survey, devised by SGB,
addresses employee courteousness and
response time.

“These were some of the concerns
that people had expressed to me, so I put
them in survey form,” said Justin
DalMolin, an SGB board member.

Van—Call drivers will pass the survey
out to riders.

Parking and Transportation also
installed a new phone system that records
all calls and aids in determining legiti-
mate student complaints. If a dispatcher is
rude to a student, it will now be on record
for the department to review.

According to DalMolin, installing
new phones and other improvements
increased the department’s operating
costs by 16 percent.

He said the department is considering
an increase in the safety and transporta-
tion fee to cover these additional costs.

“If it’s not possible to avoid an
increase, then I’ll make sure the
Department of Parking and
Transportation is using that money to its
fullest capacity,” DalMolin said.

One of the measures being discussed
as an alternative to a fee increase is the
elimination of costly and rarely—used ser-
vices such as the Student Escort Service.

Approximately two to three students
use the escort service per day, at a cost of
about $30 per student, according to
DalMolin.

To keep the escort service opera-
tional, board member Marc Friedberg
suggested students use the escort service
more frequently to increase its viability.

“Go out and use the escort service,
and get your friends to use it. That would
be the biggest help,” said Friedberg. ‘

Also discussed at last week’s meeting
was a Senate bill aimed at so-called “slum
lords.” The bill would place stiff penalties
and fines on landlords in level three cities
who do not follow building codes.

Level three cities include Harrisburg
and Lancaster, but not Pittsburgh, which
is a level two city. The SGB plans to
lobby for inclusion of level two cities in
the bill.

“What he did was morally and
ethically wrong,” said Saalakhan.

Local support from the
Pittsburgh Chapter of the Coalition
of African Americans for Justice was
voiced by Dorothy Urquhart. Her
strong words reverberated from the
the county building’s enormous
archway, attacking the media for
portraying Gammage as a villain.

“He [Gammage] was a victim,
not a villain.” In closing, Urquhart
reminded the applauding crowd,
“When something happens to one of
us, it happens to all of us.”

claimed that “a ruling for Gammage
would be a national victory.”

VRACHEL BACHELER

   

Beneath the ordinary lives of Pitt
students, deep within the catacombs of
the deserted University’s sub-1evelbase—
ment, lies a tradition which comes to life
only once a year.

Outside the student union and the
campus bookstore, screams and groans
resonate throughout the Schenley Quad.
Once annually, “Dante’s Inferno” is
reincarnated.

This year marks the 20th anniver-
sary of “Dante’s Inferno,” aka Haunted
Holland. This one night event, Tuesday,
Oct. 29, 8 to 11 p.m., is open to the entire
student body and introduces them to the
haunted underground of the Schenley
Quad.

“Call me chicken, call me what you
want, but I usually go through before the
lights go out,” said JoArm Woodson,
director of the Office of Residence Life.
She said that although a lot has changed
since the first “haunted house” 20 years
ago, it still involves your basic ghosts,
screams, and darkness.

The Haunted Holland of today,
organized by Holland Hall’s Resident
Student Association, builds from the
vision of Keith Wassum, resident direc-
tor in 1976. According to Woodson, the
liability involved with the project put the
future of Wassum’s job at stake. '

staff. “It was a real small production,”
said Wassum, today the associate vice
chancellor of Student Life at the
University of North Carolina. In the
stairwells and on Tower B’s open roof,
students were led blindfolded through a
maze of cobwebs and screams. Once on
the roof, students walked a plank and fell
onto mattresses, giving the sensation of
falling off the Tower.

Wassum and his Tower B hall coun-
cil soon moved on to larger and scarier
ideas. They found an old church on
Bouquet Street for the next year’s pro-
ject which has since been condemned
and torn down. Wassum could only hope
that things would go well—— his job was,
again, on the line.

The old “haunted” church was com-
plete with strobe lights and sound
effects. In the dirt basement of this old,
decrepit church, the Tower B hall coun-
cil dug graves and buried themselves,
and as people walked by, they sprung
from the stinking earth and scared the
bejesus out of them. “It was kinda
spooky,” Wassum said. For two years,
the group continued to scare not only
Pitt’s student body, but also neighbors,
with their annual reputation.

Once the church was condemned,
Wassum and his hall council, fearing the
tradition might come to an end, searched
for another location. In 1979, Wassum
asked to use to deserted sub-basement of

Schenley Quad. The answer from Pitt
officials: No way!

Saved by his friendly relations with
the director of housing, Wassum man-
aged to sweet talk his way into giving
birth to “Dante’s Inferno,” which lost its
original name through the years, but
continues today as “Haunted Holland.”

Wassum remembers the very first
“Dante’s Inferno,” decked out with can-
dles and smoke. “There was a picture of
Dante, and the eyes moved,” said
Wassum. Inside the boiler room of the
sub-basement, the students built some-
thing resembling Frarrkenstein’s lab.

Once the haunted house tradition
moved to the Quad, Holland Hall’s RSA
became involved and has since taken
over what Tower B’s hall council began.

One tradition with the haunted
house that has died is the jack—o-lantem
carving contest. At one time, students
displayed all of their carved pumpkins
around the Quad to decorate and draw
students into “Dante’s Infemo.” In addi-
tion, the proceeds from the event were
donated to a different charity each year;
today, Haunted Holland is free of
charge.

But what the Texas Chainsaw
Massacre of ‘76 has in common with
today’s Freddy Krueger is the
Halloween scare which has continued
successfully for 20 years.

They also presented Lt.
Schnieder’s parents with a wooden
replica of the plaque.

The parade hosted several speak-
ers including the ROTC units’ com-
manders and guest speaker Maurice
Miller, a former enlisted United States
Marine who served in Korea and on
Iwo Jima.

The event took several weeks of
practice and preparation on the part of
both the Air Force and Navy units.

“We normally only drill once a
week, but we’ve been drilling every
day for the last two weeks.” said Major
Fonteno.

According to Knight, students had
to wake up in the early morning hours
to get the opportunity to practice for
the parade and coordinate these efforts.

“It was very well rehearsed,” he
said.

The extensive rehearsals couldn’t
prepare them for every contingency,
which is a fact of life in military situa-
tions. A failing loudspeaker system
forced the speakers, cadets, and mid-
shipmen to do some quick thinking on
their feet.

Everyone involved handled the sit-
uation in a true military fashion, work-
ing around the problems.

“You’ve got to be ready for those
types of things to happen,” said
Hoffman. “Everyone locked on and
stayed sharp.”

“We passed that test [the tempo-

Nordenherg said.

Pitt was listed as one of the top
recipients of funding for research
from the National Institutes of
Health. According to Nordenberg,
Pitt is one of the top 20 universities in
the country in terms of federal
research funding.

“By our admittance in the AAU
I/\merican Association of
Universities], Pitt is recogni/.ed as
being among the ()0 top researcli uni-
versities in North America,"
Nordenberg said.

Securing enough money to keep
Pitt running was the second part of
his report. Pitt has hired an outside
consultant to assist with fundraising,
and Nordenberg said that he is look-
ing to hire a vice chancellor for insti-
tutional advancement within a few
weeks.

“[Pitt is making] changes that
would  improve delivery of services
.. and meet the demands of what are
economically challenging times,”
Nordenberg said, addressing the
issues of operational efficiency and
effectiveness.

The restructuring of the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences will save Pitt a
total of $75(),0()(), according to
Nordenberg. In addition, changes in
the organization of Computing and
Information Services should save

State support for Pitt was less
than the University had hoped, but

this has not discouraged the
University from seeking funds for
next year. Nordenberg announced that
Pitt will ask for a (5 percent increase
in its appropriation next year. This,
incidentally, is the increase which Pitt
had asked for and was denied this
year.

“Things weren’t quite as had as
we had feared along the way...."
Nordenherg said. “We will continue
to advance the llniversityis cause
with all the skill and feeling that we
can.“

“IUPMC has} a clear vision. I
think it’s the right vision for the times
ahead," Connolly said.

The trustees will receive the Pitt

length of their respective services.
Among them, Holmes Wolfe has

“At a political level, injustice
was done,” said Roth. “It's not nor-
mal police procedure to kill some-
one.” He added that police proce-
dures need to be reviewed and
accounted for nationally, not just
locally.

Rick Adams, local organizer for
the Million Man March, emphasized
the gap which exists between the
treatment of whites and African
Americans in the judicial system
today. He demanded that citizens join
together to “build bridges where they
need built" in order to close this gap.

During the rally, a statement read
from Gammage’s family spoke of
their appreciation for the support
shown by the citizen protestors of
Pittsburgh. The family expressed
hopes that this case will set a stan-
dard of conduct for police officers
across the country.

Another protest rally is scheduled
for noon today on the steps of the
City—County Building, on the corner
of Forbes Avenue and Grant Street.

Sexual harassment
always receives an ‘F’

“SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THIS AREA WILL NOT
BE REPORTED. HOWEVER, IT WILL BE GRADE 

This sign was hung in a glass—encased bulletin board at
the Eveleth Taconite Mine according to the article, “Into the
Abyss of Harassment at Eveleth Mine” in Sunday’s Washington
Post.

A class—action suit was brought by 21 female miners
who were employed in the Eveleth mines. The harassment
which took place at the mines included threats of rape, beatings,
stalkings, and sexual propositions. After 12 years in the courts,
this case is ﬁnally coming to an end. In a few months, the
women will find out the amount of compensation they will
receive.

As we close out the 20th century, it is time for us to tear
down the walls that face women who enter into traditionally
male—dominated ﬁelds. As one woman recounts in the Post arti-
cle, a man had masturbated into her locker at work and ejaculat-
ed all over her belongings. On top of doing the same amount of
work as the men in the company, the women in Eveleth had to
deal with continuous harassment.

If women desire to work in the mines, they have the
right to do so. In some areas, traditionally male—dominated ﬁelds
such as mining and construction are the best-paying jobs with
the most beneﬁts. In our society where single parent families are
becoming more and more prominent, women need opportunities
which were once only available for men. If a woman single-
handedly raisingfour children can either work at a minimum
wage job with no beneﬁts or work as a miner, which keeps her
children fed and insured. Is there really a choice?

Women are as necessary and productive in the work-
force as men. They deserve to be able to do their jobs in peace.
To allow sexual harassment to mar their lives in the workplace
is to deny them their constitutional rights. This cannot be
ignored.

We, as a society, need to take on the mindset that
women must be treated fairly in the workplace. Harassment in
any form can no longer be tolerated.

Some men 0 further than necessary

 

In a recent issue of The Pitt
News, an editorial ran condemn-
ing the use of the drug Rohypnol
(called the date rape drug) and
those men who felt it necessary
to slip women this drug in order
to get lucky on any given night.
While I couldn’t agree more that
any man who would do such a
thing might have some deeper
problems than just a little dry
spell and an aching need to ﬁx
that, I had to laugh at the rest of
the column in which the basic
rules for getting to know some-
one and starting your basic 1-
love-you—and—want-to-marry-
you-right-now relationship with
this person were outlined.
Honestly, do you think that a
guy odd and/or desperate
enough to drug a woman in
order to get some action would
really end his evil ways upon
reading the hints for successful
dating that The Pitt News
offered? I don‘t think so either.

Personally, I’ve always
found that addressing the real
problem is the only way to find
a solution, and this is the real
problem: many men today really
couldn’t care less to begin a
meaningful relationship. In the
college atmosphere especially,
sex is definitely more desirable.
If it can be simple, no—strings-
attached sex, all the better.

This is where the problem
gets a little more complex. You

|69VvIv9\4OIDbQ|919

see, men generally believe that

women can’t handle this kind of
sex; they fear the seemingly
inevitable emotional response
which sex will elicit from any
female. Generally, again, this
sends the men into a frightened
and almost desperate state. How
can they ﬁnd the physical fulﬁll-
ment they “need” and still avoid
the emotional response that
scares the hell out of them?
Unfortunately, this conﬂict
is so great that
it has led a few
men to go fur-
ther than is
truly necessary
in‘ trying to
find a solution.
These are the
men who are
drugging and
violating inno-
cent women.
Well, let me be
the first to congratulate you
guys —— you’ve gone above and
beyond this time in finding
yourselves an easy and noncom-
mittal lay. Excuse the sarcasm.
Interestingly enough, one-
night—stands, meaningless sex,
and the like aren’t as foreign to
women as many of you guys
might believe. I mean, they are
not something that most of us
yearn for (I don’t know many
girls who leave a guy’s place in
the morning saying, “What a
great night! I hope I never hear
from him again!”), but at the
same time, very few of us are
going to do our impressions of

when we don’t get a phone call
the next day. Regardless of what
many of you guys may believe,
we are aware by this point in our
lives that one night in bed does
not equal a lifelong comrr1it—
ment.

Okay, so maybe women do
respond more emotionally to sex
than men do; I’ve never been
inside a guy’s mind, so I would-
n’t know for sure. Still, how can
that emotional
response be so
frightening to
drive men far
enough to
sedate and rape
unsuspecting
women? Sure,
that’s an
extreme sce-
nario, but I’ve
heard one too
 many guys joke
how easy Rohypnol
would make “the morning
after.” Is it really so dreadful to
deal with the consequences of
your actions? Wouldn’t it be just
a little easier (and occasionally
more legal) to be honest with a
girl? If you don’t want any
involvement after the sex, be
honest about it. Sure the sex
might not be as accessible then
as if she were, say, lying naked
and unconscious on your bed,
but I bet a few of you would feel
better about yourselves in the
morning.

Sara Burgess is fully prepared to

Reagan’s supply economics responsible for societal ills

 

With Bob Dole heading for
almost certain defeat on Nov. 5,
the Republican Party is going to
have an awful lot of soul search-
ing to do soon. How could they
possibly allow a president whom
they had derided as “irrelevant” to
governing in 1994 to suddenly
turn around andcream their can-
didate? Most Republicans will, in
all likelihood, blame Bob Dole’s
tepid defense of his 15—percent tax
cut and talk excitedly about a year
2000 bid by supply-siders Jack
Kemp and Steve Forbes. The
myth of Ronald Reagan and the
success of his supply-side eco-
nomic program during the 1980s
is deeply cherished by the
Republican Party’s intellectual
elite, to whom Reagan is a
revered icon, but they would do
well to re-evaluate the legacy of
the Reagan era. It has laid much
of the groundwork for the ills that
plague the United States today.

What exactly is supply-side
economics? It is, simply, the
belief that large tax cuts will spur
economic growth on such a scale
that reducing spending will not be
needed to balance the budget.
Sound like wishful thinking? It is.

Supply-side was promoted
by pundits who possessed little
understanding of economics (few
academics took supply-side eco-

nomics seriously), and was adopt-

ed in 1980 by presidential candi-
date Ronald Reagan. Ever since it
has been the ideological comer-
stone of the Republican Party’s
economic platform.
Conservatives claim that
Reagan’s tax cuts released a ﬂood
of unprecedented growth for the
United States.

In their defense of Reagan’s
economic policies, conservatives
typically make extravagant
claims about the wonderful
growth in family incomes during
the 19803. What Reaganites
neglect to mention is that all of
this growth happened to a small
group: 70 percent of the growth in
family income went straight into
the pockets of America’s richest 1
percent, the super—rich. As
Stanford economist Paul
Krugman points out in his bril-
liant book “Peddling Prosperity,”
the super-rich found that their
income doubled during the 1980s.
How did the rest of America do?
Not so well. Median family
income (the index that measures
the income of the typical

American family) increased only
0.4 percent during the 1980s.
Before the Reagan era, median
family income had been increas-
ing at a rate of 2.5 percent each
year since World War II. The
Congressional Budget Office says
that in 1980 the richest 20 percent
of Americans had eight times the
wealth of the poorest one-ﬁfth.
By 1989 the dis-

tional economy. Reagan’s defend-
ers have a dubious answer to the
question of why Reagan’s won-
derful ideas have resulted in enor-
mous budget def1ci.ts: Democrats
hijacked Reagan’s budgets and
larded them up with pork barrel
spending. Alas, that little claim
deﬁes logic: Reagan’s budgets
were submitted out of balance.
Over the eight

parity between years of the
those two Reagan admin-
groups had istration,
jumped to 20- Congress,

t o - o n e .
K r u g In a n
remarked: “The
widening of
inequality is
beyond doubt. It
has been as
ﬁrmly established as the fact that
smoking causes cancer.”
Considering that many
Republican Party leaders really
do think that smoking is harmless,
I guess it shouldn’t be surprising
that many also think that supply-
side economics worked.

Another subject that
Reaganites don’t like to talk about
is the budget deﬁcits of the 1980s,
which have crippled America’s
economic standing in the intema—

 

allegedly con-
trolled by an
evil cabal of tax-
and—spend liber-
als bent on
secretly sabo-
taging Reagan’s
plans, actually an a total of $16.1
billion dollars out of Reagan’s
budgets.

The ridiculous claims
Republicans have made about the
Democrats supposed culpability
on the budget deficit reminds me
of an episode I saw recently of my
favorite TV show, “Mad About
You”, where the character of Paul
is trying to convince his wife
Jaime that that renting a parking
space in their building in New

York is a good idea, despite
Jaime’s objection on the grounds
that they don’t even own a car.
After they buy the space Paul.
who suddenly has second
thoughts and decides that their
purchase was a mistake, turns on
her and exclaims, “This is all your
fault!” to which an incredulous
Jaime can only respond, “On
what planet!‘.7!?” I feel the same
way: how could Democrats possi-
bly be faulted for a mess they
tried to stop?

The failure of Bob Dole’s
phony tax cut to convince the
public to vote for him and the dis-
trust most Americans feel towards
the Republican agenda (an agen-
da which fueled Clinton’s resur-
rection) should convince the
Republican Party about how
skeptical the American people are
towards the failed economic poli-
cies of the 1980s. The Republican
Party ought to face the facts as
soon as possible: Reaganorriics
didn’t work and never will.
During the 1980s the rich got
richer, the poor got poorer, and the
middle class got squeezed. Do we
really want to do that again?
Michael Berquist wants to remind
people that those who forget his-
tory are doomed to repeat it.

to the enigmatic p.r. taylor

This letter is in response to p.r.
taylor’s article, “Where have all the
men gone?” (Wed. Oct 16) Well, this
man is still here, and he has a ques-
tion, “Why is everybody so DUMB?!”
Let’s face it, our gen-
eration, no matter how
you size it up, is really
dumb. Observe: Why
are all the women with
“sorry ass examples of

other, and spontaneously think to our-
selves, “Oh my God! I AM SOOOO
DUMB!” But now we hate ourselves
because we know what’s coming from
The Great Beyond to hit _us right in the
face: Emotion, the
Catalyst For All
Things Dumb. Result:
We lose our freaking
minds. What it comes
down to is we, men

men?” Because they’re
too dumb. to realize
that their men are
dumb. Why are the

Ten things that
suck more
than you

 

There are those of us that are meant to
be losers in life, no matter what we do or
try to do to overcome life’s little troubles
— there are those of us who never win, no
matter the situation or the circumstances.

It sucks to be a loser. You relate to an
Alice In Chains tune a bit too well. You
look around and see all kinds of successful
people around you. You see people that do
nothing but sell crack for a living and do
quite nicely for themselves; it makes you
wonder why you chose to do something
reputable.

Not that I do anything reputable, but
I’m mired in a decade-long losing streak
that shows no signs of improving, so I
decided to compile a list — a list of losers
so large that it can make any Charlie
Brown or Barry Horowitz feel like a win-
net.

It made me feel a little better, and if
you don’t think that you’re a loser in need
of improved self-esteem, remember one
thing — you do attend, did attend, or are
employed by The University of Pittsburgh,
where losers congregate to avoid being
bulldozed by construction workers in
Forbes Quad.

1. Tampa Bay Buccaneers — This

team defines futility. They haven’t made .

the playoffs since 1979. They lost their first
26 games as a franchise. They haven’t won
more than seven games since 1979. They
cut my cousin —— Chuck Fusina. They have
won only once this season, and they will
suck for years to come.

2. Los Angeles Clippers — That
other team in LA. hasn’t won an intra-
squad scrimmage in over 10 years. It does-
n’t matter who they draft; whoever they
draft sucks. Their biggest mistake was let-
ting Charles Smith go to the Knicks when
he was destined to be the Clips’ only all-
star in the last millennium.

3. Brian Bozworth —— Boz was a stud
down at Oklahoma, where he helped the

 

Pitt loses, ha tough against Hokies 7

‘Kevin Lilley

The Pitt Panther football squad
took some pride in their loss
Saturday, playing Big East contender
Virginia Tech tough for three quarters
before falling to the Hokies 34-17.

The game marked the first time
this season the Panthers (2-6, 1-4 Big
East) played competitively on the
road, having been outscored 172-7 in
their three prior contests outside Pitt
Stadium. The Hokies rolled up over
450 yards total offense and dominat-
ed the second half with punishing dri-
ves and critical turnovers, but the
Panthers managed to keep the score
from reaching the 72-0 and 55-7 lev-
els of weeks past.

“I was real happy,” said quarter-
back Matt Lytle, who threw for 152
yards on the day. “We had a lot of
guys fighting up to the last minute. I
was real proud of that.”

Panther pride translated into
Hokie trouble early in the game,
when Chris Ferencik capped a nine-
play, 50-yard drive with a 48-yard
field goal. Lytle completed three of
five passes on the drive, including a
ﬂea-ﬂicker to John Jones, in leading
the team to the game’s first score.
Tech would answer on their next pos-
session, when a 47-yard Jim
Druckenmiller pass to Cornelius

Dwayne Schulters leads Pitt with six touchdowns, including one against Virginia Tech.

White set up a six-yard touchdown
plunge by Ken Oxendine.

The 7-3 score lasted until the last
few minutes of the half, but neither
offense was without its opportunities.
Lytle led the Panthers on an eight-
play drive down to the Hokie 23, but
on the ninth play, he threw a bullet
pass into the waiting arms of Tech
defender Antonio Banks.

The interception sparked a
Virginia Tech drive into Panther terri-

 

tory, led by tailback Marcus Parker.
He ran up 44 of his 112 total yards on
the drive but was stopped, along with
the drive, by an Ernest Coakley tack-
le on a crucial third-down reception.

“Our defense played well,” said
Coakley’s teammate Jared Miller.
“We really attacked.”

Late in the second, John Jenkins
took a Hokie punt at his 41 and raced
deep into Tech turf, giving Pitt a first

The women’s soc-
cer team went on the
road to Virginia this
weekend trying to use
the long trip to finish
their inaugural season
on a positive note.
However, the Lady
Panthers finished the
first part of this trip 0-2
as they lost to the
University of Richmond
and Virginia
Commonwealth
University.

Pitt first traveled to
Richmond to take on
the Lady Spiders last
Friday. Just three min-
utes into the game,
freshman Krisi Cronk
scored to give
Richmond the lead in
the game. Richmond is
a team also in their

first season, and they
raised their record to 5-
8-1 with the 3-0 victory.
Cronk leads the team in
goals with seven, and
points with 20.

On the goal, Cronk
got the ball at midfield,
dribbled through Pitt’s
defense all the way
down the field, and
blasted a shot past Pitt’s
keeper Sarah Stout.

Kathryn Spiker
added another for
Richmond at 19:37. She
fired a long shot which
eluded the outstretched
arms of Stout. The scor-
ing ended at 46:34
when Maya Clark
tapped in a crossing
pass from Kendra
Powell to give the
Spiders a 3-0 lead. The
game would end the
game as Sarah Stout

The Pitt men’s soccer team
has had a disappointing season, but
they got two big wins this week to
raise their record to 7-7-2.

Last Wednesday, the Panthers
beat California University of
Pennsylvania 3-0 at Pitt Stadium. The
game started very slow, but it would
not end that way. It was scoreless
through the first half, as there was
very little offense.

As the second half started, Pitt
came out looking to draw first blood,
and they found it at
50:10. Matt Gray
blasted a pass from

keeper Anthony Mayer
and into the net for a 1-
0 Panther lead.

This one-goal advantage did
not last long though, as Drew Kopp
came back with another assist at
51:12. This time he set up Mike Dyer
to give Pitt a 2-0 lead. Kopp was not
the only one involved in this play. Pitt
started with the ball on the right side.
A striker passed it to Kopp in the mid-
dle, who dropped it off to Dyer on the
right side. Dyer waited for the goalie
to vacate the net and attack him. His
patience paid off as the keeper did as
expected, and Dyer blasted it by
Mayer for the goal and a 2-0 Pitt lead.

After that goal, the Vulcans
played frustrated soccer. Both Neil
Henehan and Jozef Petrcko received

 

yellow cards within a few minutes.
Pitt missed a couple of great chances
to go up 3-0. California replaced their
goalie, but not even this could stop the
potent Panther offense.

Keith Hoetzlein got the ball in
the middle and he also waited for the
goalie to make the first move. Once
again, the goalie obliged the Pitt
offense, and Hoetzlein blasted the ball
off the right post. The ball bounced
into the net and finished the scoring.

Pitt looked to continue its
winning ways Saturday when they vis-
ited St. Francis College in Central
Pennsylvania and they did, beating the
Red Flash 2-0.

Brian Marich opened
the scoring for Pitt at
32:50. This gave the
Panthers a 1-0 lead
which they held into
halftime. Marich
replaced Dean Astorino
in the first half.

In the second half, Coach Joe
Luxbacher decided to leave Marich in
the game and this decision paid off.
On Marich’s second shot of the game,
he scored his second goal. He netted
this one at 54:58. This finished the
scoring and gave the Panthers a 2-0
win.

The win raised Pitt’s overall
record to .500. Pitt out shot St. Francis
18-15, while Panther keeper Adam
Spitzer walked away with the shutout
making seven saves.

Pitt finishes the season with
two games at home against Canisius
and Syracuse, Oct. 30 and Nov. 3
respectively.

Football 

down at the Tech 33 yard line A Lytle
scramble moved the ball to the 16, but
a one-yard gain by recently-AWOL
running back Myke Duck, and an
incompletion, set up third-and-nine at
the 15.

Lytle fired a pass into end zone
traffic on third down, but Torrian
Gray stepped out of the crowd and
snared the ball for an apparent inter-
ception. The officials, however,
flagged Banks for pass interference
and awarded Pitt the ball on the two.
Dwayne Schulters dove over a pile of
linemen on the next play for a Panther
score.

The score also translated into
Pitt’s second lead of the game. Again,
Tech would answer, this time rattling
off four straight first downs en route
to a one-yard Brian Edmonds touch-
down run. Tech would botch the
extra—point snap and take a 13-10 lead
into halftime.

After the contest, Head Coach
Johnny Majors was still praising the
Panthers’ performance in the first
half.

“I think the team fought harder
[and], quite possibly, executed better
in the first half,” said the coach. “We
thought we had a good opportunity to
win. We knew we were going to need
a few breaks, but we though we were
going to win the ballgame.”

Pitt caught the biggest break in
the game late in the third, when
Virginia Tech’s Angelo Harrison
muffed a punt and E.C. Varoutsos
recovered for the Panthers at the
Hokie 15. Duck and Lytle took two
rushing turns each for the end zone
before Lytle’s third shot, a draw from
two yards out, hit paydirt.

The dramatic draw gave Pitt a 17-
13 lead and signaled the end of Pitt’s
upset attempt. The Hokies answered
the score with a nine-play, 67-yard
bulldozer of a drive —
Druckenmiller’s six-yard touchdown
strike to Shawn Scales was the only
pass the entire series.

“They just pulverized us,” said
Majors of the drive, which featured a
rare combination of no-huddle
offense and between—the-tackles run-
ning that put the Panthers in a 20-17
hole.

Pitt couldn’t answer, and Scales
burnt the sleeping Panther secondary
for a 71-yard touchdown reception on
the first play of Tech’s next posses-
sion. Lytle would throw another inter-
ception to set up a final Hokie score
— another one-yard Oxendine dive
that put the game out of reach.

“For a team that’s been beat up
like we have,” said Majors, “I think
that this game shows something about
[us]. We did make progress; in my

opinion, more today than any other

time this year.”

THE PITT NEWS

A‘

Soccer 

gave up three goals and made eight
saves. Eileen Jackson, the netminder
for the University of Richmond,
made three saves to record her first
career shutout.

Coach Roland Sturk said, “We
played hard against Richmond. They
were probably the quickest and
fastest team we’ve played. We played
well, but still came up short.”

Not only did the Panthers lose
this one, they lost their leading scor-
er, Megan Beasley. She suffered a
sprained elbow early in the game.
This left Pitt without its two offen-
sive stars, Mia Mora and Beasley.
Mora had hoped to return this week-
end, but she was not able to.

 

These two key losses made it
even tougher for the Lady Panthers

going into their game against
Virginia Commonwealth., a 6-0 loss.
Not only did the Panthers leave their
two best offensive players behind, it
seemed as if they forgot their defense
as well. Christina Kenney tied her
own VCU school record with six
goals in this game.

VCU applied early pressure to
Pitt and got what Coach Sturk called
“two soft goals.”

He said, “Kenney didn’t create
these goals; she just cleaned up after
Sarah [Stout] couldn’t control the
rebounds.”

On the next four goals, Sturk

FROM PAGE 12

 

called his team “timid. They backed
off after she [Kenney] got two or
three goals.”

Kenney was the only player for
Virginia Commonwealth to score.
VCU outshot Pitt 23-5 to complete
their domination of this game.

Sturk said, “VCU were more
experienced and more aggressive.”

Sturk‘ summed up the weekend by
saying, “The scores were what
they’ve been all year. We are a more
experienced team, but we can’t win
the game. I have seen progress in the
team, but they’re not quite there.”

Pitt has just three more games
this season. They finish up next week
at home against Robert Morris.
