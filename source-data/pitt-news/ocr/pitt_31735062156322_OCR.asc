Radiation Lab Works With Potential Atomic Energy

Atomic Force Under

 

  Study in Lab

By ‘JOHN DeNINNO
' A new potential force for atomic
energy is being experimented with i
at the Sarah Mellon. Scaife Radia- 
tion Laboratory on the Pitt camp- '
us. " s
In this building, the site of Pitt’s §
cyclotron, physicists are working l
with hydrogen, along with other
matter to bring about a more ac-

curate knowledge of the power of
atomic energy. Heading the pro-

rector of the laboratory.

Research In Progress
Dr. Allen said that this work
is, at present, the fundamental
research program going on at the
lab. In learning more about the
atom, he said, they are attempt-
ing to determine the forces that
are present in the nucleus (core)
of an atom. In other words, he
explained, they want to know why
two hydrogen atoms and two neu-
trons (hydrogen atom without its
characteristic positive charge) can-
be combined to form a,helium5
atom‘, and What forces hold these;
nuclei together. ;
To do thisvthey must learn the:
structure of the nuclei. j
This will be done by ﬁring high §
energy particles, coming from the?
cyclotron at 20,000 miles per sec-
ond (one tenth the velocity of:
light), at a foil. By studying the
way the particles pass through
and are deﬂected by the foil, they
are beginning to develop informa-
tion concerning the structure of
the nuclei.
Process Illustrated
Dr. Allen -explained the process
by using the following illustra-
tion. Instead of a foil, say there is
a wooden wall and behind that
wall is a large iron ball. If you
were to shoot bullets at that wall,
those that penetrate would strike
the iron ball and be deﬂected. In

A
Y

4' 1% *
the "same way the high energy
particles strike the foil. Some pass
through, losing an amount of-their
energy to the foil, and are deﬂect-

ed at different degrees of energy.

By studying the way the par-
ticles are “kicked out” of the fail
the physicists hope to learn more
about the helium nucleus, Dr. Al-
len said. He added, “If we learn
how to efﬁciently do that process
we will have a very potent force
for atomic energy.” ‘

Speculating, he said that the
energy released by the sun is
probably nothing more than the
release of the helium nuclei by
this process plus a few other minor
stages. He added that the hydro-
gen bomb is really an “elaborate

 

I t :3.

scheme of combining hydrogen
and neutrons to form water.”,

“’ Combination Utilized

This combination of hydrogen

and oxygen to form water can be

utilized to explain how the energy
released by the formation of heli-
um aids the atomic bomb. When
hydrogen and oxygen combine
foming water‘, the reaction causes
the release of energy in the form
of heat. Heat can be converted
into energy.’ , ‘

-The project in the radiation lab
is being sponsored jointly by the-
Oflice of Naval Research, the
Atomic‘ Energy Commission, and
the University.

Working with Dr. Allen on the
project are Dr. J. McGuer, as-
sistant professor of physics,- Dr.
R. Bender, associate professor of
physics, and a number of gradu-
ate students.

,By NANCY JONES
One of . Pittsburgh’s authorities
on business trends,’ genial gray-
haired Bervard Nichols, has his

oflice right here at Pitt. In one of ‘
the- oﬁices of the large, data-ﬁlled '

Bureau of Business Research on
the. twenty-ﬁrst ﬂoor *~,Mr. Nichols

carefullyestudies the business scene _

in the Pittsburgh ‘area and then
edits_his_ reports in the “Pittsburgh
Business Review.”

' “The Bureau receives reports jf
direct from companies, from the _ is

government, and from Federal‘ re-
serve banks,” he explained. When
statistics comeﬁn they are in code
numbers. These are assembled in
charts which comparethe changes
week by week ~ and month -by
month. Thenit is his job to write
the approximately M ﬁfteen page
“monthly summary of business" and

economic conditions in the Pitts- - 

burgh district” which is published
for business ﬁrms, newspapers,
and the radio. “The whole point
is to supply bench marks so busi-
nessmen can compare -their ‘own
business with the rest of the busi-
ness in the area.” \
Work Isn’t New

This kind of work isn’t new for

Mr. Nichols. He’s been doing «it

~ for a good many years. It all‘be-

gan when he started" to make busi-
ness reports while attending New
York University." There he earned

the M.B.A. (Master of Business

Administration) inf1925 and soon
-after received ‘an invitation from
the-University of Texas to come
and help them establishetheir’ Bu-
reau of Business Research. In the

next four years at the University‘

of Texas Mr. Nichols played a big
part in getting the Bureau on its
feet. Healso began their publica-
tion, “Texas Business Review.”

At that time, the early 1930s,
Pittsburgh became interested in
establishing a Bureau; so Mr. Nich-
ols came here to, help. When the
research economist ﬁrst came to
Pittsburgh there were many blue
,laws" and he had the misfortune to
arrive on a Sunday. In the dis-
mal, deserted city‘ nothing‘ was
open and the stranger didn’t know
a soulhere. It’s a good thing the

economist, now listed inlthe ‘l9i5li

“Directory of American Scholars,”
didn’t obey his first thought, which
was to head for Texas-as" soon as
possible. ' '

Ideal Location

When things woke up around the-

city Monday Mr. Nichols settled

uate School of Public Health, is

Cross hopes to make available in

prevention. )
The drive will begin tomorrow

tions and pledges may be made

search. "‘I always did want to

come here because Pittsburgh was

an ideal location for the study of
business. I could see the great po-
tentials of this area.”

A graduate of Utah State Col-
lege, he was born and reared on a

cattle ranch near the northern end"

proudly tells how his grandparents
walked across the plains in‘ 1847
and ’48 all the way from Omaha to
Salt Lake City. They were part of
the early pioneers who built up
that area. From these grandpar-
ents Mr." Nichols learned the Dan-

Don Milletary initiated a policy

ousted from the group by report-
ing io' Student Congress on the
February 20 meeting of the Uni-

_ versity Athletic Committee. (Mil-

letary will remain on the commit-

tee despite his dismissal from SC).

Bemoaning the lack of student
spirit at Pitt, Milletary said that
the Athletic Committee was hop-
ing that the Pep Club could be re-

activated next fall. He also an— -

nounced that Dr. Paul Masoner
would replace the late Robert X.
Graham on the committee.

‘Interesting Hobbies

‘ Mr. Nichols collects original
items from many of his friends
who are artists, poets, musicians,
and cartoonists; In his ‘collection
there are many original sketches
by artists and many original car-
toons by men such as Hungerford
and Reichhold, cartoonist for Don-
nie Dingbat. He’ also has a ﬁne
collection of U.S. stamps.

A Another spare-tir'ne hobby of
Mr. ,Nichols ‘is, helping his wife
with’, her unusual collection of
crystal buttons. In addition, he

i has been thinking about writing a

book on forecasts.’ He_ has been
collecting‘ material on the accur-
acy of forecasts and his book
would '-trace this subject for many
centuries back. ’ _
Mr. Nichols has taught in both
high schools and colleges. He likes
teaching but he still. prefers his
work with the.Bureau. An inter-
esting ,thing about the Bureau, he
points out, is that they get " all
kinds of business statistics that go
to make up the weekly and month-
ly index of business. They geta
report of every telephone call
made, how many "carloads of garlic
are received in Pittsburgh, and of
how‘*many animals are slaugh-
tered. They also get all kinds of
freak telephone calls, such‘, as the

Students say that one reason
they would like to be married

Other students feel‘ that because
they met at Pitt the person they
intend to marry, they wo'uld like

Sports Group H riddles Ton ite

By V. PAUL HARRISON y
Spanking new and ready to cope.

. with intramural problems, the un-
. named sports_ council on IM aifairs

will meet this evening at 5 p.m.
at Ellsworth Center. Representa-
tives from. most student governing
bodies, athletic department ‘(men’s
and women’s) teams, and the pro-
fessional. schools will band to-
gether to‘ draw up an agenda that
will try to bring increased inter-

‘ est in IM—sponsored activities.

A. , deﬁnite purpose of this

V groupwill be "to" investigate stu-

dent feelings and reactions in an
effort to build a stronger IM pro-
gram—a stronger program in the
respect that women as well as
men will compete in organized
sports. ' 1 ’ - - ‘

'lVliss Margaret E. Covert, direc-
tor of required women’s physical
education, announced she would
be in favor of IM competition be-

 tween coeds on the class level 'but,

due to ' limited facilities, this
would be improbable in the near
future. _, ~ ‘

“We feel that we could, how-
ever, with the cooperation .of the
student body, begin a few"events

 such as‘ ‘mixed volleyball, bad-
minton, and social dancing,” Miss

Covert said. Usually, the Wom-
en’s Recreation" Association spon-

sors women’s individual. and
group sports, ~ .
Previously, the representatives

Athletic Director Tom Hamilton,

"and as a result of that gathering
the group decided to merge’ for
a common goal of multiplying stu-

dent IM participation.

IM Director Leo Bemis said
’ that the new organization will

“start from scratch.”
