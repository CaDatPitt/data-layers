After walking a woman
back to her apartment on
Dithridge Street in North
Oakland early last Thursday,
Pitt student Kevin Cecil was
greeted with two bullets in the
back of his head and might be
a quadriplegic for the rest of
his life. ’

Cecil and his friend were
about to enter Webster Hall,
an apartment complex on
Fifth Avenue and Dithridge
when they heard two people
approach them from behind.
The woman, her key already
in the door, ran up the stairs,
but Cecil was shot twice in
the back of his head, accord-
ing to Pitt Police Chief Rick
Boyd.

“It seems that they sensed
danger,” Boyd said about the

“Basically, it appears to be a

Cecil was taken to

administrator said he is in crit-

police, his spinal cord
severed in the shooting. His
family requested that no other
information on Cecil be
released to the public. ,

Last Wednesday, the nation’s first
black speaker of a state House of
Representatives donated over 200,000
personal papers to Pitt’s Hillman Library.

This is not the first time that Rep. K.
Leroy Irvis has helped to enhance the
university. Irvis, a Pitt Law School grad-
uate, sponsored a bill in 1966 that started
Pennsylvania’s state-related university
system. This system enabled the
University of Pittsburgh to become
involved and receive millions of dollars
in public funds.

“Essentially, it is a collection of. his
speeches, bills he introduced, correspon-
dence of his legislative career, all of his
files and other materials he accumulated

while he was in office,” said Rush
Miller, director of Pitt’s library system.
Miller said the documents will be
housed in the archives service center on
the third ﬂoor of the Hillman Library. He
said that sometime in 1996, Hillman will
hold a grand opening for the K. Leroy
Irvis Library, which will also include the
university’s current African American

{collection and related materials.

“We will be in the process of going
through these papers and organizing
them so that people can use them for
research,” said Miller.

“We’re in the preliminary stages of
doing it now,” he said. “Mostly it's all
still in boxes.”

Miller said that responses to the collec-
tion have not been good so far due to the
disorganization, but he did say that Pitt

Former state representative donates documents

will be the permanent home for the
papers.

Irvis, 75, is a native of Albany. N.Y..
and graduated from Pitt’s Law School in
1929. He served in the state House
beginning in 1958, and was elected
speaker in 1977. He was re—elected as
speaker in 1983 and served until 1988.

The decision by Irvis to enter into this
agreement with Pitt came after he nearly
gave the documents to Temple
University in Philadelphia when the
school argued that it “has shown more
progress” than Pitt “in searching out
black students.” according to last
Wednesday's issue of the Pittslmrglz
Post-Gazette. .

Chancellor J. Dennis O'Connor said
that Irvis has achieved "an honored

war is deﬂating France’s effort

Chirac has threatened that if

UNION, S.C. —- The judge
presiding over Susan Smith’s
trial ruled that a written confes-
sion and other statements could
be heard by the jury, even
though Smith’s lawyers main-
tained their client was tricked
into the confession.

Before the judge’s ruling,
Union County Sheriff Howard
Wells told the courtroom how
he had lied to Smith in order to
gain a confession. Smith had
said that her children were kid-
napped at an intersection out-
side the town of Union. But
Wells told Smith he knew that
couldn’t be true because his
deputies had been working a

surveillance at that crossroads.
In reality, no deputies had been
working at the intersection.

According to Wells, who was
with Smith in a church gymna-
sium on the afternoon of the
confession, Smith then broke
down and began to sob. She
took his hands and asked him
to pray with her. After they
prayed together, she asked for
Wells’ gun so she could kill
herself, then confessed to the
murder of her two sons. -— The

The Pitt News, Wednesdaya July 19, 1995

Students celebrate
love of dancing

By Michelle Friedman
For The Pitt News

 

“When I was 9 years old, I
would set my alarm to wake
me up at 3 a.m. so thatl could
watch old movies,” said Pitt
graduate student Ann
Chapman. “They were mostly
musicals  Fred Astaire and
Ginger Rogers. One of my
favorites is Gene Kelly‘s
‘Singing in the Rain.”

Chapman. who is majoring
in vision studies at Pitt’s
School of Education, has
something in common with
Gene Kelly. Both graduated
from Pitt, and both share a
love for nostalgic-style danc-
ing.

Through Chapman’s love of
classic movies came her desire
to learn ballroom dancing.
One day when she was walk-
ing through the William Pitt
Union, she saw an announce-
ment for an event sponsored
by the Pitt Panther Ballroom
Dance Company. That was
back in 1991. She has been
hooked on ballroom dancing
ever since.

She went on to serve as the
company’s business manager.
Currently, Chapman is still a
member. On Monday, she was
reunited with the rest of the
company and other dance
enthusiasts as they celebrated
their love for ballroom danc-
ing at the third annual PPBDC
picnic. which was held at
South Park.

The PPBDC is actually a
non—credit course offered at
Pitt every fall and spring
semester. Those who enroll in
the course range from Pitt stu-
dents and alumni to faculty
and staff. Others from the

community are also involved.’

PPBDC receives some funding
from SGB and has many activ-
ities and performances
throughout the year.
Ballroom dancinghit its
prime in the 1940s when Big
Band musicians such as Glenn
Miller’s Orchestra and the
Tommy Dorsey Band were

popular.

Europe never really lost that
much interest in ballroom
dancing.

“Learning ballroom dancing
is like learning to use a fork
and a knife in some coun-
tries,” said Jan Getting. vice
president of the PPBDC and a
1995 graduate of Pitt. “It also
serves  a social function.
Spring Ball season is big in
Czechoslovakia. lvana Trump
just arranged a big ball in
Prague.

“This is the type of dancing
that you would learn at Arthur
Murray and would pay a lot of
money to learn. You could
learn ballroom dancing with
the PPBDC for a very small
price. It’s a very cheap activi-
ty. It might only cost $5 a
night.”

Mary Kellner teaches the
non—credit PPBDC class 
well as the one-credit Social
Dancing class at Pitt. She
started dancing when she was
8 years old and started teach-
ing dance when she was 16.
She has danced professionally
with her assistant Joe
McGowan and has taught at
Pitt for the past five years.

One of Kellner’s fondest
memories as a teacher of ball-
room dancing was of a deaf
student.

“I had no idea at first that
she was deaf,” Kellner said.
“She felt the musical rhythms
through the vibrations from
the floor.”

Mike Chasky, president of
the PPBDC, was also in atten-
dance at the picnic. The
evening started with a cookout
and ended with ballroom
dancing to the live music of
the Frank Lasko band. Chasky,
along with many of the 60
other participants, spent the
evening under the stars on an
outdoor. dance floor and
danced such dances as the
samba, swing, cha-cha, waltz
and fox trot, 9

Cecil last week in front of Webster Hall was a pure case of
random victimization and that it can happen anywhere.

“Where are you going to run to? Where are you going to
hide?" asked Delaney. “This was unusual. It was not the norm,
and the officers have taken it personally.”

Delaney said unfortunately Pitt Police can’t be everywhere
all the time.

“We can’t violate people’s rights and bar them from going
places on campus.” said Delaney. ‘‘It’s not a war zone, we
can't put a moat around the Pitt campus.”

An issue the shooting does bring to light is the safety ser-
vices available to Pitt students.

“I would strongly urge students to take advantage of all safe-
ty facilities oncampus,” said Rick Boyd, director of Public
Safety.

One of those facilities is Van Call. a service run by Pitt’s
department of parking and transportation that will pick up Pitt
students and take them to areas in Oakland. providing that the
system is not abused by students who have been out drinking
alcohol.

“Van Call is a service students could make better use of,”
said Boyd. “I wish they would.”

This is not to say what happened to Cecil could have been
avoided if Van Call was called, but it is an important service
for students.

“I don’t want to indicate they did anything wrong; people
have the right to walk anytime they like.” said Boyd. “It’s trag-
ic to think people don’t have the right to walk wherever they
choose.”

Delaney said that the easiest thing Pitt students could do is
use common sense when out in Oakland. However, Boyd and
Delaney both agree that the incident last week was random and
the students had little control over what happened.

“It’s tragic because it could have happened to anybody,”
Boyd said. “They weren’t being careless.”

Boyd said something he wished he saw more of is students
reporting things on the streets of Oakland that they find unusu-
al.

“People don’t give themselves enough credit for the built-in
warning mechanism that we all have,” said Boyd. “We don’t
get many calls from students who see things of a suspicious
nature.”

Bexd §ii8il§l¥ eneesrases students. tg 9191: up the phone and
te police when they see questionable characters hanging out
in odd areas on campus. Students can call Pitt Police at 624-
4040, 24 hours a day.

“We are happy to respond to the calls, and we know how to
approach the situation with discretion,” said Boyd. “I’ve seen
too many instances where people knew something wasn’t
right, but didn’t go with their initial feelings.”

Unfortunately, according to Boyd, some of those people end
up becoming victims. ‘

Pitt Police have brochures on how to keep safe available at
the department in the basement of Forbes Quad. They deal
with issues such as keeping safe on campus, not taking
chances on campus and date rape.

Pitt’s Van Call hours are Sunday through Wednesday from 7
p.m to 2:30 a.m. and Thursday through Saturday from 7 p.m.
to 3 am.

tigation with the help of the University of
Pittsburgh Police Department.”

According to City Police, there was anoth-
er shooting with a similar background less
then 15 minutes later on the top of Mount
Washington. Two people were shot from
behind, and black teenagers were seen jump-
ing into a car. Freeman said it is still unclear
if that shooting was related to the North
Oakland incident, but it is being investigated

Sgt. Mike Brown, spokesman for the
Pittsburgh Crime Stoppers Unit said that a
$2,000 reward is being offered for any infor-
mation that would lead to an arrest in the
shooting. He encourages anyone with infor-
mation in the shooting to call the Pittsburgh
Homicide Unit at 665-4050 or the Crime
Stoppers at 665-8477.

Cecil, 21, is an engineering major at Pitt,

about to enter his senior year. He is from
Boiling Springs. Pa.. a small town outside
Carlisle, about 200 miles from Pittsburgh.
Cecil’s parents could not be reached for
comment.

This is the second time in the past six
months a Pitt student has been seriously hurt
for apparently no reason. In January, Pitt
junior David Orsborn was brutally beaten up
outside the Towers, as students walked up
and down the steps and witnessed the attack.
Less then two weeks later. Pitt Police arrest-
ed five suspects in the beating, four of them
juveniles.

Orsborn was hit and knocked down the
steps, his head banging on each one. He suf-
fered a severe concussion and facial frac-
tures and underwent a lengthy rehabilitation
process at Bryn Mawr Rehabilitation Center.
near his home of Downington. Pa.

“You cannot explain the
feeling of seeing someone
your own age who has so
much to offer and so much
potential, but his life is now
ruined,” Harper said. “You
can’t explain that to somebody
until you see that body lying
there motionless and know it’s
for no reason.”

The randomness of the vio-
lent act has shocked many stu-
dents. It has terrified some
Webster Hall residents, some
of whom chose to pay a higher
rent to live in the building
because of its safety features.

Rona Kaufman, a Pitt senior,
cited the security of the build-
ing as the only reason she’s
living at Webster Hall, but
now feels like she’s stuck in
her apartment after 9 p.m.

“I assumed it was probably
one of the most safe places
off-campus I could live,” she
said. But after the shooting,
Kaufman said she feels ner-
vous going anywhere. She
always walks with another per-
son at night, but last Saturday,
even walking with her
boyfriend didn’t soothe her
fears.

‘‘It’s not right that we should
be so nervous about walking

two blocks,” she said. “Even
waiting for the bus — it’s
pointless, it’s still not safe.”

But not all residents fear for
their safety any more than
usual.

“I’m not scared to live here
anymore,” said Natalie Sipula,
a Pitt student. “I think it’s a
one—time thing.” V

Harper also felt the apparent
security of the building merit-
ed the extra money she pays
for rent. The building seemed
to be in a safe area and Fifth
Avenue is well-lit, she said.
She and her two roommates
pay $865/month for their
apartment.

“This is the last place I
expected something like this to
happen,” she said. “I thought,
‘I’ll pay the extra for the secu-
rity.’ I thought I was safe.”

But the image of the after-
math of the shooting has vault-
ed Harper into a world where
she can’t seem to grasp her
former sense of security.

“I’m terrified,” she said.
“I’m afraid to be alone. I’m
afraid to walk out of the build-
ing.”

Harper’s fear has disturbed
her sleep for the past few
nights. Every noise she hears
outside the window makes her

nervous.

Both frustration and confu-
sion have erupted within her.
“I don’t know what causes
people to act that way and why
people think they can go up
and shoot people in the back of
the neck.”

Harper said she feels that
Pitt must do more to attack
crime. She also said the media.
especially the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, did not give the
shooting enough attention.

“Maybe the university is
doing something but I haven’t
seen anything,” she said. “I’ve
still heard of muggings.”

Harper also recalled the
beating incident last January.
when Pitt student David
Orsbom was pummelled into a
coma. She said she feels these
incidents have been ignored.

But no matter how Pitt
reacts to the shooting, Harper
has already turned the corner
and found the body of a 21-
year—old Kevin Cecil outside
her home. That memory will
never sleep, and Harper says,
neither will her fears.

“I don’t think that I will ever
feel safe.”

said he hoped Pitt would

rates, which has been an
ongoing goal at Pitt.

According to Ken Service,
director of communications,
the number of black students

who have been accepted for
fall semester at Pitt and who
have paid deposits is 36 per-
cent ahead of last year. From
a total freshman count of
2,430 students, 320 accepted
so far are black. The number

of black students last year
was 235.

Burn off the leeches

Last week a couple of lowlifes, or punks, or scumbags or what-
ever you want to call them came into Oakland. They invaded our
campus, our community, our home. Then for apparently no rea-
son, defying any sense of humanity, one of these punks pulled out
a n.

all split second later, Kevin Cecil’s life, his parents’ lives, his
brother’s life, his friends’ lives, were changed forever. Kevin was
shot twice in the back of his head last week. He was walking a
woman home from the south part of our community to the north
section.

Kevin is a 21-year-old engineering major at Pitt. He is from a
small town in central Pennsylvania. The night he was shot he was
out at a bar with some friends. Basically, your average Pitt stu-
dent.

People have a tendency to look for someone to blame when
such hideous, brutal, disgusting crimes take place. If you want
someone to blame in this instance, go no further than the source,
the leech on humanity who pulled the trigger.

' Don’t make the mistake of saying that campus police. should
have been patrolling there. No matter how many cops there are at

. Pitt, they can never be on every comer at once. The police can not

be chastised every time something horrible happens at Pitt. They
do everything they can and they do not deserve it.

It’s also easy to say maybe Kevin and his friend should have
taken Van-Call or a taxi. But then these predators would have
preyed on somebody else. This was a random shooting with no
apparent motive, not something directed specifically at Kevin and
his friend. If they hadn’t been there, the next person along would
have been the victim.

And don’t blame this shooting on the cliche that it’s a big city
and this kind of stuff is bound to happen. The fact that we all
chose to make a city our home does not make crimes like this any
less foul or any more acceptable. A city is no different from any
other placegand random shootings are just as horrible here as they
are in Mayberry.

Kevin Cecil will never walk again, and the only person to
blame, to be held 100 percent responsible, is the waste of exis-
tence who pulled the trigger. Perhaps a gang-related event, this
senseless act has taken a great part of the future away from a fel-
low Pitt student.

We would suggest that the miscreants who were brave enough
to shoot someone else in the back had better start watching their
own. Pittsburgh Crime Stoppers has offered a $2,000 reward for
information leading * “r 1 arrest of the people responsible for this
crime. The uni‘./es   ﬁns: to Vice Chancellor for Student

We are proud to see the urm ens.-._. .;o1‘m;  taking such posi-

~ tive steps toward finding the trash who perpetrated this crime. If

tion please call Pittsburgh Crime Stoppers at 665-4050 or 665-

Resistance is free but futile

ree Will is an elusive
Fconcept which, despite
the fact that most people
cannot precisely define it, most
people nonetheless insist they
possess. I will demonstrate,
with the use of two very basic
assumptions, that free will
does not truly exist. My
assumptions will be as follows:
l.'Ifp0ssible, when faced
with a set of options, people
will always choose the option
that they feel will please them
the most (or hurt them the
least).

2. At the instant of a person’s
conception, that person has no
control over his characteristics:
physical (e.g. eye color) or
mental (e.g. ideals, intelli-
gence, etc.).

The existence of free will, by
any definition, means that a
person has the ability to choose
any particular option from a set
of available options, as
opposed to being forced to
choose some option.

Now assume free will exists.
Given assumption 1 above, it
then follows that in every deci-
sion, a person will always
choose the option he feels will
please him the most, because
free will ensures that it is pos-
sible to do so.

This is perfectly consistent
with everyday. experience.
Even the actions ‘we are
“forced” to take (e.g. paying
the rent) are taken not because
we are truly forced but because
we prefer those actions to the
alternatives (e.g. living on the
streets). Therefore, at first
glance, the existence of free
will is perfectly consistent with
our experience.

However, an important result
here is that if free will exists,
then a person will always
choose the action that he feels
will please himself the most.
Therefore, the outcome of any
decision depends directly on
our individual desires, or our
“state of mind”. This is also
quite consistent with experi-
ence; different people make

different choices when faced
with very similar situations
precisely because they have
different ideas about what
makes them happy.

Now consider an arbitrary
decision. It has just been
shown that the outcome of that
decision depends on internal
factors (our state of mind), but
in general the outcome can
also depend on other factors
which are external to the mind
(e.g. the fact that a man is
holding a gun to your head).

Here’s the crucial point: At
an arbitrary instant of time,
there is a fixed external situa-
tion and a fixed internal state
of mind. The outcome of a
decision made exactly at such
an instant must be fixed,
because the person must
choose the option that most
pleases him, and what pleases
him is by definition fixed by
his state of mind.

This conclusion doesn’t by
itself imply that free will does
not exist. Consider for example
a person driving a car. At an
arbitrary instant of time, the
wheels of the car are tilted at a
fixed angle, the accelerator and
brake are depressed by some
fixed amount and, therefore,
the motion of the car at the
next instant is completely
determined; nonetheless, the
driver may still be in full con-
trol of where the car goes at
that instant and at later
instants. What does it mean to
say that the driver has “con-
trol” over the car? It means
that the driver can willfully
change the factors that deter-
mine where the car goes.

Now it’s obvious that we
can’t change the external fac-
tors in a decision, any more
than a driver can control the
positions of the other cars and
the hills, trees, etc., on the
road. So the relevant question
here is: can we control our
state of mind, much-like a dri-
ver controls a steering wheel? I
will show, arguing by induc-
tion, that we cannot.

First assume there exists an
instant of time when you have
no control over your state of
mind. If that were the case,
then any decision made at that
instant must not only be fixed,
but also must be out of your
control, because external fac-
tors and the state of mind com-
pletely determine decisions,
and external factors are beyond
your control.

Now, what can cause your
state of mind to change?

Again, only two possible types

of factors can enter: internal
and external causes; there is
nothing else. However, any
external changes due to your
decision would be out of your
control because the action
which caused the external
changes is out of your control.
Furthermore, it has been
assumed that at this instant
your state of mind is beyond
your control, so changes in
your state of mind due to inter-
nal factors must also be
beyond your control.

The conclusion in a nutshell
is as follows: If there ever
exists a time when your state
of mind is entirely out of your
control, then from that instant
on, your state of mind will
remain rout of your control, and
thus the outcome of any deci-
sions will be out of your con-
trol. Finally, by assumption 2,
at conception you do not have
control over your state of
mind; therefore, it is not possi-
ble that you have such control
any time after your conception.
Therefore, you can have no
control over the outcome of
our decisions, assuming free
will exists. This is obviously a
contradiction; therefore, free
will carmot exist.

Now you either may be dis-
mayed by the fact that you are
not truly free, or you may
delight in the fact that you
know something most people
don’t, depending on your state
of mind.

I-HE VOX
JULY 19 1995

What does Lollapalooza ‘95
have to offer Joe and Judy
Schmoe, the concert-goer?
Well, despite the growing ticket
price, it still has a higher enter-
tainment quotient than an
Fi.E.M. concert. I mean, it’s
more bands for your buck, right?
Actually, this year's concert is
the most “underground” than
previous Lollas. At least three of
the bands started and achieved
success in the indie-pendent “do
it yourself” realm of music. Then
there’s the second stage: give
me indie rock! Not to mention
rap! It is a motley bunch no mat-
ter what stage show you watch
. . ska, pot-crazed rappers,
noise rockers, punks  Jeepersl
Nah, its not too bad this year
(it’s been so much worse). Oh,
yeah. There’s sure to be over-
priced hippy- jewelry, and pricey
ethnic cuisine. Check out the
political booths, too, and please
don’t forget the second stage.
Enjoy...

Sonic Youth

Sonic Youth = Lollapalooza
‘95 headliners. Well, they’re
much better than Smashing
Pumpkins  ask Pavement!
Hell, it doesn’t come as much of
a surprise, does it? SY has
been consistently putting out
great music from the under-
ground since the early ‘80s and
has eventually been assimilated

into a more mainstream culture.
They’re the perpetual cool -
always on top of the latest thing
before anybody else. Whether
it’s introducing the world to cool
bands they’ve chosen for open-
ing acts (like the Boredoms), or
telling Cindy Crawford and her
House 0’ Style audience how to
dress (X-girl), the band knows
where it’s at. With age and a
slow, but continual, mainstream
acceptance, the band has yet to
lose their “hipster”
credibility/integrity.

it is pointless to describe the
band’s music. Journalists have
too much fun with words like
“noise” and “alternate tunings.”
What you need to know is that
the band helped redefine what
punk and rock meant by avoid-
ing cliches and being inventive.
They’ve written abrasive songs,
they’ve written beautiful songs.
They’ve recorded 9 albums — if
you aren't familiar with the
group, buy the records.

I never thought of Sonic Youth
as an arena band. They always
played swanky bars and shook
the walls with their feedback
onslaught. Open-air amphithe-
aters seem like the last place for
this type of sound. However,
when I watched The Year Punk
Broke I quickly saw a different
scenario altogether. SY was
sprawled across a huge stage in
Europe, playing to a stadium
crowd, and you know, it wasn’t
that bad. it’s a bit weird, but not

bad at all. This group is the
“parental figure “ for much of
contemporary indie/alternative
rock. I guess it is fitting that they
show the young bucks how it’s
done.

Hole
Sell-out Central (a.k.a.

Lollapolloza’s main stage) has a
bit of a twist this year, as the
Pun’kins give way to -Hole:
instead of a male rendition of
corporate schlock, Courtney
Love and the Lovettes supply us
a female version. But while
Smashing had little to no punk
credibility to begin with,
Courtney and her mates have
systematically beaten the hell
out of theirs, and now the only
thing that’s left is a case of
Molson and $500,000 bills (their
price for playing the Great White
North’s Beerfest ‘95).

They’re picking up the green
for a reason, though — because
the erstwhile teenage whore
knows what it takes to keep her
name on the tip of everyone’s
tongue and her finger in the
proverbial pocket (no pun
intended, I assure you).

What is most ironic is that
though Love gets the press,
gets the attention and gets the
magazine covers, she’s the
weakest part of their stage act.
Granted, every 13-year-old
grunge chick’s gonna caravan to

 

the Mecca of Star Lake to
behold their portrait of female
strength, but they’d all be well
served to sit back and listen to
guitarist Eric Erlandson and their
female rhythm section, ignoring
Love’s philosophyin’ and stage
divin’. As the three proved at
their Pittsburgh concert in the
spring, it's the jams that matter.
Love doesn’t seem to under-
stand that  or even care. ‘

Cypress Hill

Replacing A Tribe Called
Quest — Perry Farrell’s rap
throw-in for '94 — is the blunt-
smokin’, Pig-poppin’ Cypress
Hill gang -—— Perry Farrell’s rap
throw-in for ‘95. The South
Central trio is two summers
removed from their last album,
but their continued popularity (or
the mere fact that bong refer-
ences — and hits, for that mat-
ter — never seem to go out of
style) brings them back and
droppin’ their phunky bilingual,
fresh as a sober afternoon. B-
Real’s Dristan wail and Sen
Dog’s bi-syllabic backing vocals
(“boo-ya,” for the most part) are
accessible to hard cores and frat
boys alike (though you’d be
hard-pressed to find too many
Theta Chis in South Central). DJ
Muggs is on the tables, and,
who knows, you may even get a
surprise appearance from the
Funkdoobiest. if they rhymes

-paloo  ﬂ

 

aren”t"e'n'o'ug'h"‘to'"m
or the 20-foot blunt they like to
tote on stage doesn’t perk your
little sunburned ears, then just
remember that the falafels ain’t
that good, and the second-hand
smoke’s always a cheap high.

Beck

Also appearing on the
Lollapalooza mainstage is Beck,
who in about 15 hours ascend-
ed from working the LA video
store scene to becoming the
chanteur of 1994’s pop culture
with the slogan of the year, and
the now infamous, ‘‘I’m a loser
baby....” etc. “Loser” quickly
became the melodic catch-
phrase that enabled twenty-
somethings everywhere to clev-
erly retort to their friends and
parents why job hunting really
wasn’t that necessary. It also
helped Beck to sell jillions of
copies of Me//ow Gold (DGC),
an album that demonstrates
how innovative sounds don’t
always come from expensive
studio equipment (it was record-
ed on Beck’s living room eight-
track). ’

With Me//ow as well as the
popular single ‘‘In a Cold Ass
Fashion,” a song from the
Jabberjaw benefit compilation
(Mammoth) in which he match-
es the hyperfeedback with a
shake—yer-booty beat, Beck has
impressively proven that despite
his babyface and penchance for
passivity, he’s no one—hit wun—
derkid. Even Jon Spencer loves
Beck, hiring him to close the
song “Flavor” (from John
SPEX’s Orange (Matador) with
a rap bit that features mucho
distortion.

Working with a wide assort-
ment of musical influences that
range from the likes of Woody
Guthrie to “crazed street poets
who made up songs about pota-
to chips and exploding TV sets,”
Beck carefully measures spoon-
fuls of raw blues, rap and noise.
Mixing them together with heap-
ing cupfuls of feedback, Beck
uses these fine ingredients to
stew a delicious musical broth
that is sure to surprise and
please even the most skeptical
of Lollapalooza goers.

Pavement

Pavement looks like the kids
that were always picked last in
the school kickball drafts. “Cut
Your Hair” from the Crooked
Fia/n, Crooked Fla/‘n album sent
them into MTV’s buzz bin and
now, their latest album.
Wowwee Zowee. has them as
part of the Lollapalooza ‘95 line-
up.

Before my first Pavement
show, l strolled into a local

 

record store to find more vinyl ink. Like
most vinyl stores, it's the size of a
Kennedy-era bomb shelter for a family of
4, minus their pet. The a/c was cranking,
and a lot of patrons were saying their
“excuse me’s" and “sorry’s” to explain all
the accidental fondlings and rubbings.
“Sorry, was that your thigh?”

Before the show, Spiral Stairs was sell-
ing Pavement T-shirtsand I told him I
was I was in the record store earlier
today. And how I was kicked to the curb.
Shit. He told me I should have said
something to him, he would have bought
it for me. Shee-it! ’

Kicking ass from Stockon, Ca.,
Pavement began as an “exercise in futili-
ty,” explained percussionist/keyboardist
Bob Nastovich. Steve Malkmus and
Spiral Stairs played their guitars during
the melancholy of college breaks and
recorded their diamond-in-the-rough 7”,
Slay Tracks.

“l have never listened to Pavement,
what should I buy first?”

l’ll say Slanted and Enchanted. You
can’t go wrong. lt’s one of those great
things that’s been overlooked, like
Satchel Paige.

And whatever you do, don’t go wait in
line for food when Pavement’s on. Eat
Grass! Pavement are user-friendly, too.
They won’t come into a moshing crowd
swinging for a lawsuit. Not typical at all,
they aren’t just the band that “cut your
hair.” Malkmus’ styles are too particular
for that.

The Jesus Lizard

Well, I'm still flabbergasted that the
Boredoms were included as part of last
year's Lollapalooza mainstage. This
year, the “black,sheep” award goes to
the Jesus Lizard. While not as esoteric
as Japanese noise rock, the Lizard cer-
tainly aren't a household name yet.
Despite putting out a major label release
(gaspl), and doing a video for MTV (l’ve
never seen it on 120 minutes), their
exposure is less than, say, Beck or
Pavement.

That's not to say the band doesn't
have a large, devoted cult following. It's

 

The Vox, Wednesday, July 19, 1995

no surprise; while other pretty boys talk,
talk, talk, the Jesus Lizard rock! I think
they’re one of America’s premeir bar
bands. The music is tight with a capital
“T” and HEAVY!!! Just what you need
with a refreshing Iron. The group is the
quintessential Touch and Go riff-rock»
group — many attempt to cop the style
but lack the wit and precision to pull it off.
Hell, few people have the attitude the
band does. I’m not talking about spiked
jackets that say “Rancid,” I’m talking
about “P-U-N-K.” This can be attributed
to crazed frontman, and former member
of the reknowned Scratch Acid, David
Yow. I can’t promise, but I doubt he’ll uri-
nate on the audience or. fling excrement
(he’s mellowed with age), but there’s
bound to be some lunatic stage antics to
entertain all thrill-seekers. I’m_ sure the
group will insight many a youngster to
“mosh,” too. The bottom line is that the
band is very entertaining because they’re
good at what they do and have been
doing it for years. Oh, yeah  yell “Mouth
Breather” really loud and frequently.
They love that.

Mighty Mighty Bosstones

Has it only been five years since the
Bosstones first graced our ears with
Devil's Night Out, their independent label
debut straight outta Boston? Since then
the plaid warriors have gone nowhere
but down, creating a genre (ska-core)
and then somehow becoming an instant
parody of themselves, immersing them-
selves in image. They are their own
biggest fans. The Bosstones’ pressure
drop is a test case for the anti-major
label set. Their formulaic shows can be
fun for the whole moshin’ family, and it is
true that, when pioneering “ska-core” on
their first album, they did it better than
anyone else before or after, but overall,
the band’s tones are neither Mighty nor
Boss.

What the Bosstones are, really, is
MetaI_With Horns. And what they do, and
do well, is Whip Teenage Boys Into A

Frenzy. In this way, they have achieved
their dream: to be more like “heroes of
the sexually disenfranchised” —-
Aerosmith. If this is what you expect from
Lollapalooza (meaning you are either fit-

teen, male, and have a three-foot chain.

on your wallet, or you are a jaded old
fuck like yours truly), then go be Whipped

hybrid of the two.

The answer to the test question

The Vox, Wednesday, July 19, 1995

 

 iiisttri   wet

Ireland is home to a very superstitious
culture, with one particular fixation on
blackbirds. Apparently, should you spot
one blackbird fly above you, your demise
is imminent, while seeing two is a sign of
good luck. Thus, many an ancient, with-
ered washerwoman is to be seen craning
her neck in search of a second bird to
cancel out a harbinger of doom.

This in mind, what indescribable good
fortune is within my ken after seeing, this
morning, not one, but TWO Guinness
trucks stopped at a red light on Forbes
Ave.? The only answer could be the
approaching arrival of The Chieftains.

For about 25 years, the Chieftains
have, in one incarnation or another, been
the twin blackbirds of Celtic traditional
music. With innumerous albums and
tours under their belts from the ‘70s, and
firmly placed as the best Irish traditional
group in the world, the ‘80s became a
period of experimentation for the group
—— trying on films, documentaries, and
crossover events to philanthropically
spread familiarity with Celtic musical her-
itage. Eighties albums such as Ce/tic
Wedding, Experimenting with Breton
Music, and Reel Music: The Film Scores
met with great critical and good commer-
cial success, while their Irish Heartbeat
recording, combining their music with the
vocals of Irish singer/songwriter Van
Morrison, became a hit record on folk and
popular charts.

It was a formula which worked musical-
ly and commercially, as well as fit the
Chieftains desire for sociability and
change within their music. This produced
albums like their three Grammy Award
winners, Another Country, An Irish
Evening, and The Celtic Harp, and their
newest collaborative release, The Long
Black Veil.

The Long Black Veil is the title of a
twisted little country hit from the late ‘50s,
sung on the album by Mick Jagger, which
has the ghostly, sad and murderous con-
notations associated with muchlrish
music. The album is, likewise, a some-
what twisted assortment of collaborations
with the Chieftains hooked up with the
likes of Sting, the Rolling Stones and
Tom Jones (recorded in Frank Zappa’s
home studio). While the big name stars
do carry their weight well (Sting in Irish
on Mo Ghile Mear is just eccentric, and

islgev in the Fields

beautiful enough, to work), the Chieftains
have done too much to take the spotlight
off of themselves. By relegating the
music to the background (there are a
mere three instrumentals out of thirteen
tracks), the band’s ploy to put the life
back into the “living tradition” backfires,
and the talents of the players is eclipsed
by the names of the singers.

The smaller named guests on the
album, such as guitar great Arty
McG|ynn, and button accordion virtuoso
James Keane, become mere background
figures, fleshing out the bed in which
Jagger and Sinead sleep. While it is won-
derful to hear very talented singers like
Sinead O’Connor and Tom Jones do tra-
ditional material with the best musicians
in the field, and the album is packed with
great performances, it will be a relief on
Thursday night at Star Lake to hear the
Chieftains play a set of traditional tunes
their own, as they do so irrefutably well.

That’s right, Star Lake. Not only are the
Chieftains playing in a massive outdoor
venue (expect a near sell-out of the
7,000-seat pavilion), but they are playing
with Vancouver-based tranquil-pop singer

Sarah McLachlan. Not exactly the pub

session we would all like, but certainly
not to be missed.

As the story goes, both the Chieftains
and McLachlan will be playing full sets
separately, though the ‘‘all-star jam” syn-
drome to end the show is inevitable.
What to expect? Well, in the words of
Irish singer Christy Moore, “Before the
Chieftains could start to play/ seven
creamy pints came out on a tray”. A
sociable evening of mostly hardcore, tra-
ditional lrish and otherwise Celtic tunes
and songs with, perhaps, some country
and pop standards thrown in for flavoring.
As for McLachlan, her latest album,
Fumb/ing Towards Ecstasy, is sure to be
milked for all the sensitive folk-pop it’s
worth. To be fair, though her songs are at
best dull, at worst patently offensive,
McLachlan’s voice and singing style can
be invigorating, and her band is com-
prised of some of Canada’s best musi-
clans.

Finally, expect an explosive second-
stage set from Pittsburgh’s Ploughman’s
Lunch, immigrant Celtic-Rock bastards.
With every show, the band’s approach
changes according to the whim of
singer/guitarist/songwriter/conceptualist

Karl Mullen. From traditional to rock to
ska, and now to African drumming with
members of locals Blindsight, the band’s
music is always exciting and vital. Their
CD, Sodom and Begorrah, is more of a
sketch of their songs than a gospel; they
use the same song structures, varying
them according to the mood of the musi-
cians and the atmosphere of the time.
The songs are an impeccable collection
of pop-rock based in Irish tradition with
Tom Waitsian lyrics also based in a Celtic
milieu. They are extremely popular
around town, and with good reason. It is
not often that a band can combine artistic
success with danceability and deca-
dence.

Crumb
A documentary by Terry
Zwigotf

When it comes to comic
books, punditry is stupid. it
undoubtedly has it’s own
place, just not in movies
about comic book artists like
Robert Crumb. So, don’t let
blowhard art critic Robert
Hughes take your dysfunc-
tional pleasure out of
Crumb. And as for Deidre
English, former editor of
Mother Jones Magazine, her
comments drawing the con-
nection between Crumb’s
gargoylesque cartoons and
pornography are interesting
because they’re just so
amazingly predictable.

They’ll be talking a lot
about high and low art,
whether Robert’s cartoons
are sexist or racist, but nev-
ermind, the story is in the
Crumb's San Franciso Bay
area family. it doesn’t take a
genius to know one, but
Zwigoff’s twenty-five year
friendship surely didn’t hurt
production as we’re privi-
leged to so much more with
Robert’s family. Brothers
Charles and Max, their
mother Beatrice Crumb,
Robert’s wife and daughter,
plus ex-girlfriends, a first-
wife and son round out a
Crumb-‘informed cast of
interviewees who share their

stories of Robert for the
camera. They’re stories of
sexual repression, sexual
longing, and portray the
Crumb brothers as outcasts
misfitted by a hip society.
But we also learn of Robert’s
escape from his twisted
home life, the happiness he
shares with daughter Sophie
and wife Aline Kominsky.
And with this kind of family
accessibility, it doesn’t take
a Hughes or an English to
get R. Crumb. Or toyget
Zwigoff’s take on Robert,
which is just as honest,
detailed and in—depth as
you’d expect it should be.
Zwigoff’s not above play-
ing the role of ironic filmmak-
er, either; the edits, musical
score and positioning of
interviews fit the form of his
boho-subversive subject.
Watch when Zwigoff cuts
from the Crumb living room,
where the brothers swap
enema stories, to the Empire
State Building long-shot.
And how about when
Zwigoff plays off windy aca-
demic-speak spinning the
myth that is Crumb, to more
succinct ex-girlfriend talk:
“He is endowed with one of
the largest penises in the
world.” And when the focus
shifts to Robert’s beating off
(the cartoonist fixates on his
own illustrations for, ah,
inspiration), Zwigotf lets art

critic Hughes hang himself
intellectualizing masturba-
tion. “Well, I’m sure Picasso
did it,” Hughes assures us,
then giving a psychobabble-
fied history of art and spank-
ing the monkey. All to stop
himself short, as if all his
pondering matters nothing,
“Does he actually do that?”
These moments stand out
from the film, and for me to
tell anymore would only ruin
them like a gratuitous trailer,
where the fun is spoiled
beforehand

Far from the Ozzie and
Harriet ‘50s ideal, Charles
Crumb says their father was
a tyrannical monster. Father
Crumb was a full metal jack-
et who specialized in “train-
ing people effectively.”
Juxtaposing this crew-out
image, Zwigoff offers indus-
trial footage of the way the
‘50s are supposed (?) to be
remembered: homogeneous
happy days minus the
grotesque, an ideal the LSD-
inspired R. Crumb has been
cartooning ever since with
big-dicked Willies and bal-
looned-derrieres. The
Crumbs were no Cleavers;
Charles, Robert and Max
slept in the same bed until
their mid-teens and spent
their repressed adolescence
doing comics, leaving.us
with the legacy that is R.
Crumb. How perfectly god-
damn delightful it all is to be
sure.

Crumb opens ‘at the Hex
theater, Southside, August
4th. 381-2204.

The Vox, Wednesdayi, July 19,1995

 

Would you believe me if I told you
the ‘Burgh’s biggest theatrical event of
the summer will not be taking place at
City Theatre. or the Playhouse, The
Pit, or even Heinz Hall or the
Benedum Center? Also, the crowd will
mainly be made up of working-class
pre-teens and their parents and grand-
parents. And, it will be shown on pay-
per-view television around the globe.

The World Wrestling Federation is
bringing its traveling troupe to the
Civic Arena Sunday night, August 27,
for Summerslam, the second-biggest
annual wrestling event after
Wrestlemania.

Pittsburgh has been a big pro
wrestling (RASS’-lin) town since 1963,
when local hero Bruno Sammartino
became champion of the WWF. Even
with attendance down throughout the
country, the WWF always draws a
good crowd in the Steel City. Vince
McMahon and Co. recognize this local
enthusiasm and that is why they
chose our backyard for a global pay-
per-view event.

But most of you are probably still
lost back there at that part about
wrestling being a theatrical event.
Wrestling?! The stuff where steroid
freaks pretend to beat each other up?

Yes, I say, it is time for pro wrestling
to take its rightful place in the theatri-
cal milieu.

The many detractors of pro
wrestling love to define wrestling as a
pseudo-sport —— kind of like kickboxing
and amateur wrestling, but without
actually hurting each other. The words
“fake” and “fixed” often roll off the lips
of these same critics.

But, it's no less an artifice than any
dramatic portrayal. Do you consider
“Waiting For Godot” or Citizen Kane to

Piledriving Godot

be a lesser work because the endings
are pre-determined?

Taking a theatrical view of wrestling,
you can begin to appreciate the spec-
tacle. The roles in this performance
will be simple —— pro-wrestling match-
es are usually simple morality plays,
where good and evil are pure and the
only ambiguity is whether good will tri-
umph or evil will cheat and eke out a
victory. You can be sure, though, that
evil will get its due in the end.

Costuming and ring presence (or
stage presence, if you prefer) will cer-
tainly be of interest to the average the-
atergoer, and the “acting” perfor-
mances will surely range from at least
passable to dreadful, which will be fun
for the “Mystery Science Theater
3000” crowd.

(“Oh yeah, that vicious stomp to
three feet in front of his leg must’ve
really hurt him, almost as much as the
punches to three feet in front of his
face.")

Shakespeare it ain’t. But this is a
workin’-class town (tahn) with workin’-
class values, and wrestling is workin’-
class theater, which ain’t the same as
all that artsy-fartsy stuff an ‘at.

For those.of you not particularly
interested in theater or who are as of
yet unconvinced, I would also recom-
mend Summerslam as a good place
to go if you simply like watching large,
sweaty, half-naked men pretend to
injure each other.

Summers/am will be held at the
Civic Arena on Sunday, August 27,
with opening bell time at 6:45 p.m.
Tickets, ranging from $10.25-$30, are
on sale now and can be purchasea
through Ticketmaster (sorry Pearl Jam
fans).

human beings

looked up to and
Columnist idolized by
Brad America's youth
Isles for making mil-
lions of dollars?

There’s an increasing trend of
problems present in football
today.

Let's start with the new way to
spell rookie —— millionaire:

The upstart Carolina Panthers
signed their ﬁrst-ever pick,
Kerry Collins, to a seven-year
contract worth somewhere
between $21 and $23 million.
The deal also included an NFL-
record $7 million signing bonus.

Not too shabby for someone
who has never had to face a
Derrick Thomas or Bruce Smith
rush.

This deal has thrown the mar-
ket out of whack for everybody
above Collins.

The Houston Oilers repoitedly
were very close to signing their
top pick, Steve McNair, to a
seven-year deal with a $5.5 mil-
lion signing bonus. McNair was
taken two spots ahead of Collins
at number three, and will likely
hold out until he gets at least
$7.5 million for his autograph.

All of that for a quarterback
who honed his skills against
those highly competitive
Division I AA opponents.

The same goes for Collins’
teammate at PSU, Ki—Jana
Carter, the No. 1 pick overall.

The Bengals were close to
signing Carter to a long—tenn
deal with a $6 million bonus.
He’ll most likely settle for no
less than $8 million.

What makes matters worse for
the Bengals is that Carter’s agent
is Leigh Steinberg, who also rep-
resents Collins, Troy Aikman
and Steve Young, to name a few.
These are just a few of the many

- negotiations that have come to

abrupt delays.

The Steelers have only signed
ﬁve of their 10 selections, and
camp started yesterday.

The trend of J ack-the-agent
climbing the million-dollar
beanstalk for his unproven
c1ient’s potential hasn’t even
reached the clouds yet.

Next year, the No. 1 pick will
likely request no less than $10
million for their services, and
that will include missing all of
training camp and the fnst few
games of the season.

Does anybody know where
Tony Mandarich, the. all-

The show's over for band director

By Mark Gordon
and Jackie Duggan
The Pitt News

Pitt Band Director O’Neill Sanford resigned last month,
after a stay at Pitt marred by controversy and angry musicians.
Interim Director Jack Anderson will take over the band pro-
gram in its time of transition.

Many band members had been privately criticizing Sanford
for over a year, dating back to last September when the direc-
tor was investigated by Pitt for misuse of university funds.
Although he was cleared by Pitt, the dissatisfaction from band
members lingered on until the Pitt Athletic Department
announced Anderson, an associate director, would be named
interim director.

Mike Bailey, drum section leader of the band, is glad
Anderson was given the job.

“He is the best candidate they could pick. We are all very
excited,” Bailey said. “It’s going to be lik.e what Johnny
Majors did for the football team — the best decision they
could have made.”

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 

Pitt's band director, O'Neill Sanford (left), resigned from his position last month. Assistant

director, Jack Anderson (right), was named interim director.

Drum line instructor Steve Melby is also excited about
Anderson leading the band.

“He knows people that will put money into the program.
Before people were afraid, because they didn’t know where
the money was going,” Melby said.

“I am happy Jack is the director. Things are going to be a lot
better,” Melby added.

Anderson said he knows some band members were upset
with Sanford, but he plans to get the program back on track
quickly. ~

“The goals are to develop some marching style and return
some pride to the band,” Anderson said.

Anderson’s status however, will be in jeopardy after the
upcoming football season. Assistant Athletic Director Mark
Hollis said the position will be open to new candidates.

“Anderson can make himself an applicant [for the position]”
Hollis said. . '

Anderson said he will apply for the position full-time, but
for now he is concentrating on the band.

“We are shooting to put 200 marchers on the field,” said
Anderson. “With the resurgence of the football program,_ we
think we can do that.”

Sanford, who previously had a similar position at the
University of Minnesota, never found his niche in the band
program. Last summer, Pitt conducted an internal audit on
Sanford, investigating accusations that he took volunteers out
to meals and charged the university.

However, after the audit, Pitt Athletic Director Oval Jaynes
said that there was no evidence Sanford was guilty, only
adding to the discontent some band members had with
Sanford.

Former band member Dakon Brodmerkel distributed a sur-
vey to band members last fall on the direction they thought
the band program was going. Some complaints in that survey
written against Sanford included him showing up late for
games and practices. Some complained he was never in his
office and had a general disconcem for the students.

In the Sept. 6, 1994, issue of The Pitt News, Brodmerkel

said that the results of the survey were “good for for every
staff member but O’Neill,” adding that 50 percent of the peo-
ple surveyed had a problem with the director.
, “I don’t have anything
 against him He never did
. anything to me, but he did
 put the band program in bad
’ shape,” Bailey said about
Sanford. “It was getting
smaller and smaller.
Recruitment was down, and
so was morale.”

“We were all very
unhappy,” added Melby
who said that on Senior
Day, the last game of the
season where seniors have
g an opportunity to get up and

make a speech —- usually of
gratitude or rememberance
-— he expressed how poorly

was going. -

Final basketball recruit, Blount, passes SAT

By Matt Grove
Staff Writer

The final piece is now in
place for Panther coach Ralph
Willard’s recruiting puzzle, at
least for the upcoming sea-
son, as 7-foot center Mark
Blount recently met the mini-
mum SAT requirement for
NCAA athletes.

Blount is the last of the six
incoming freshman to meet
NCAA standards and be eligi-
ble for the 1995-1996 season.

Out of Dobbs Ferry High
School in New York, Blount
highlights a Panther recruit-
ing class that experts have
ranked as high as second in
the nation, behind only

Michigan’s.

He will be joined by 6-4
guard Vonteego Cummings
out of Thompson, Ga.; 6-7
forward Michael Gill from
the nation’s capital; 6-7 Baton
Rouge native Isaac Hawkins;
6-8 power forward Andr_ae
Howard from Philadelphia;
and the sleek 6-2 guard Kellii
Taylor out of Maine Central
Institute.

With the loss of Jaime
Petersen to graduation,
Blount will battle 6-10 Gerald
Jordan to fill the vacancy left
by Petersen in the middle.
Jordan sat out last season
after transferring from
Morgan State.

As a senior at Dobbs Ferry,

Blount racked up impressive
numbers, including an intimi-
dating six blocked shots per
game. His play was good
enough for him to be named a
1995 Parade All-American.

Unfortunately, Blount has
been surrounded by contro-
versy off the court. Over the
past four years, he has been
enrolled in seven different
high schools, including
nationally known Oak Hill
Academy in Virginia.

In a previous interview, Pitt
assistant coach Sean Cleary
attempted to put to rest some
of the speculation of Blount
by saying, “He wasn't going
around getting kicked out of
schools. A couple of schools

wouldn’t let him play basket-
ball, so he transferred out.”

Questions have also been
raised about his recruitment
by various top-notch pro-
grams. Blount added fuel to
the fire when he walked out
of a scheduled press confer-
ence this past spring at which
he was to announce his deci-
sion to come to Pitt over Big
East rival Syracuse and Metro
Conference powerhouse
Louisville.

For now the dust has set-
tled, and hopefully Blount
will help bring the crowds
back to the Field House and
take the Panthers back to the
Big Dance for the first time in
three years.

‘From page 11

“There was a need for a
major change, and they made
the right one.” Melby said.
"In three or four years, we
could be one of the best bands
in the country.”

“It has been a long, com-
plex process. The university
knew there was a real need
for a change, and they made a
change for the better,” Bailey
said.

Pitt bands do more for the
university then play at foot-
ball and basketball games,
according to Anderson. They
have played in Labor Day
parades. at Pittsburgh Steeler
games and other various uni-
versity functions.

“We provide music when-
ever called on by the
University of Pittsburgh,”
Anderson said.

The band is also seen at all

spend their money.

Charlie Garner and Bernard
Williams, both Philadelphia
Eagles veterans, reportedly failed
surprise drug tests during the off-
season.

Gamer, a running back, was
pulled over for driving under the
inﬂuence in Virginia and tested
positive for marijuana. He faces
the possibility of a four—to-six
game suspension.

Williams is an offensive line-
man. and this was only his first
offense, so he probably won’t
miss any action.

Tim Worley did the same thing
with the Steelers a few years
back, and where’s he?

On a more tragic note, there
was the accidental shooting of
Charles Blades by his cousin,
Brian Blades, veteran wide
receiver for the Seattle
Seahawks.

Rumor has it that Brian and
brother Bennie. a safety for the
Detroit Lions, were out on the
town to celebrate the Fourth of
July. After the limo the two were
in dropped them off at their
condo—development, one of
Bennie’s ex-girlfriends began to
squabble with Bennie over the
custody of their child. Brian,
looking for a solution to the
problem, went upstairs to get a
gun, “just to scare her.” Charles
went up after Brian, to talk some

Charlie’s

“Hidden behind Mitchell 3
Bar you 71 find the best
cheesestea/es and hottest
wings this side of
Philadelphia and
Buffalo. ”

sense into him. A scufﬂe
between the two ensued, and the

j gun discharged, entering Charles
through his chin.

The Blades brothers are
known for their late-night
carousing and their many broken
engagements. They also own a
total of 11 cars between them.

That’s something to look up to
for these rookies’ newly shined
gold cards and bottomless check-
ing accounts.

There are some players in the
league who actually do make a
positive impact off the ﬁeld.

Notably there is Pitt graduate
Ruben Brown. who created a
transplant fund for Kara Morris.
daughter of the Panthers’ former
strength coach, Buddy Moms.
according to Sunday’s Pittsburgh
Post— Gazette.

Kara. who is 8, has autoim-
mune chronic hepatitis and will
require a liver transplant within
the next three years.

Brown's goal is to raise
$250,000 for the fund. and he is
personally donating his outside-
football income. In Buffalo, he
has a radio show, a rookie diary
for a Buffalo newspaper and a
television spot on Buffalos NBC
affiliate two times a week.

In addition. the Steelers’ No. 2
pick, Kordell Stewart, is donat-
ing $300 for every victory to
underprivileged children in the
area.

At least there are a couple of
rookies who have started out on
the right track and are putting
their money toward notable caus-
es. It will be interesting to see
what the future holds for them.
