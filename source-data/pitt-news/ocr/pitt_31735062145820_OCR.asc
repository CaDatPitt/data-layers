‘  hDay‘” Standard

If “That's That,” the current pro-
duction of the Pennsylvania Mask
and Wig Club is any. criterion of ‘a
college production, the Pitt Cap and
Gown Club has something to aspire
to. Its superiority was undoubtedly
due to" the strong organization which
the Mask and Wig Club enjoys. It
is an old and well established ‘or-
ganization and “That’s That” is its
‘thirty-sixtli annual production. This
in part, explains its success, but the
question of alumni and undergradu-
ate backing is also a most important
factor. .'l‘o make the club at Penn
is as much an honor as to make the

Last week we asked every student
.-at Pitt who likes to think and does
thinkto send hisname tothe writer.

Four students outof 8,000 sent in

cise of their" minds for other than

_ the trivial and temporal things» that
always can be found for our Lattention;

L What a proud record Pitt has to

they -ﬁnd an; interest in thinking

A It would be foolish for us to se-
riously say that there are ONLY four

thinking students at Pitt just ‘because

-Lthatfwas‘ the number of names we

received in answers to-our request for
such students to send them in. _

But it Lisnot foolish for us tosay
that there are-only four students who,
hearing someone insinuate that the

of their names as examples of stu-
dents who cannot be indicted‘ for lack
of intellectual inclinations,

The astoundiugapathy of the stu-

seems able to awaken them—-not even
the realization that they are well be-
low the standard of college students
generally, L E L -

If someone zinsinuated“ at some
other university that the student body‘
was a bunch of “dumbelLls”, we doubt
if that venturesome person would
long remain peaceably in that insti-
tution. - ’ L V L ’

Here, we ‘deliberately insult the in-
telligence of Pitt students by sarcas-
