Oakland residents
say shooting victim

It’s been almost two years since Pitt student Kevin Cecil was
paralyzed by a random shooting, but his family and friends say con-
tinued support from Pittsburghers is helping him make progress.

Though Cecil now lives with his family in Downington, Pa,
some Oakland residents say attempts to raise money for his medical
treatments have helped the Pitt campus make progress, too.

While walking a friend home, Cecil was shot by sixteen—year—
old Bruce Cabbagestalk in front of Webster Hall on July 13, 1995.
Cecil was hit in the back of the neck, which left him a quadriplegic.

Cabbagestalk was apprehended, convicted, and sentenced to 18
to 75 years in prison last year. He pled guilty to the shooting.

Cecil has recently been credited with helping to solve two of the
biggest problems in Oakland: lack of community and panhandling.

The Second Annual Kevin Cecil Golf Outing, sponsored by the
Oakland Business and Civic Association, will be held May 22 at
Southpointe Country Club. .

The OBCA raised about $28,0()0 for the Cecil family last year
and are hoping to raise $15,000 to $20,0()0 this year, according to
Oakland businessman Chris Monti, who is coordinating the outing.

“It will be a great day,” said Monti. “Last year was absolutely
wonderﬁil. It was a lot of fun. It was also the ﬁrst time Oakland got
together as a community  Not only is the money important to
Kevin, but just seeing all the people who came out to support him.”

Also, donation cans were placed in several Oakland businesses
last year, with all proceeds going to the Cecil family.

« According to some Oakland residents, the cans curbed
Oakland’s panhandling problem.

“[Cecil’s] name means a lot. People are more willing to give to
him than to the panhandlers. When the panhandlers aren’t getting
money, they go somewhere they will,” said Iany Dashefsky, presi-

Pro‘-liters support Supreme Court
ruling, but say it doesn't apply  

Heidi Price

 

A meeting of pro—life students
Monday said a recent Supreme Court rul-
ing that permits abortion protesters to get
closer to abortion clinics is a step in the
right direction, but that more freedom is
needed. ,

A Feb. 19, ruling permits two protest-
ers to walk beside a woman entering cer-
tain abortion clinics.

Mary Irwin, organizer of Project
Multitude, spoke at a recent meeting of
Pitt’s Students for Life. Project Multitude
focuses on guaranteeing demonstrators
their First Amendment rights.

She said few abortion protesters go
beyond their rights to picket clinics.

“We’re about guaranteeing the right
to picket, protest, leaﬂet, and congregate
on a public sidewalk,” said Irwin. “We
step right up to the line of our First
Amendment rights; we just don’t cross it.”

Irwin’s discussion focused on the
Supreme Court decision that upheld the
15-foot “buffer zone” surrounding clinic
ent1ances,but offered new freedoms for

- her, as a result of the ruling, according to

 

protestors.

The ﬁxed zone previously could not
be entered by anyone except the patient. It
was designed to ensure safe access for
women seeking abortions.

But the new ruling allows two abor-
tion protestors to enter the buffer zone and
walk beside the patient up to the clinic
door. The woman entering the clinic is
also permitted to have two escorts with
Director of Women’s Health
Services.Debbie It1i.

This is a new advantage for protes-
tors, but the Supreme Court struck down
another proposal that would have allowed
the buffer zone to become movable, sur-
rounding the patient as she enters and exits
the clinic.

As the law stands now, protestors
cannot interfere with the woman’s ability
to enter or leave the clinic, but the “buffer
zone” ruling may not apply to all clinics. If
that’s true, more than just two protestors
can follow women to and from the doors
of an abortion clinic.

In her speech, Irwin said that the

- Scull
Fried

There is no such thing as an
AIDS victim. People who have
tested HIV—positive have to be
either survivors or warriors.

This is the message that televi-
sion actor and dancer Scott Fried
brings to those he talks to. It is
also the way he sees himself and
all_ others who have tested HIV-
positive.

Fried will speak at Pitt on
tonight at 8 p.m in the Kurtzman
Room of the William Pitt Union.

Fried tested positive for HIV
in 1992 and emphasizes that he
has been living With, not dying
from, that condition for the past
five years.

“When you’re first told that
you’re HIV-positive, your reaction

you want control over it, not a dis-
ease. You fight hard for your life,
because now you see what it’s
worth,” Fried said.

Since he was diagnosed, he
has continued working as an actor
and even appeared on the popular

soap opera “Guiding Light.” He

also has helped found the Teen
HIV Education group in New York
City.

He spends the rest of his time

lecturing audiences about HIV,

AIDS, safer sex, and making the
most —- and best —— of their lives.

Scott’s lecture on Wednesday
is entitled “AIDS, Love, and

a full life while HIV-positive. He said
he will use his own story to give
inspiration to those who are HIV-pos-
itive in order to give them a more
hopeful and spiritual way to live with
the condition.

“You just do what you have to do
and move on. With the bad news you
receive, you must learn to deal with it
and challenge yourself to grow and
not let the crisis control your life,”
Fried said.

However, people don’t have to do
it alone. He says that family support
can be very helpful, but each individ-
ual must decide how best to work the
situation out with his family.

“Families will often support you
when a crisis like HIV arises, because
all families are capable of love,”
Fried said. .

Fried’s message during the lec-
ture will not only be about living with
HIV or AIDS, but will include such
topics as safer sex, how the disease is
transmitted, and a history of AIDS

Fried will also talk about the
methods of HIV testing and when it is
best to be tested if you feel you may
have encountered HIV.

Students at Pitt who think they

,may have contracted HIV or who
want more information about the dis-
ease should contact the Student

counseling before and after the test-
ing and pamphlets on preventing HIV
and other STDs. A student can be test-
ed for HIV if he feels it is necessary.

There is no charge for the test or

Health Department on a walk—in
basis.

THE PITT NEWS 3

Students discover there's no
one definition of leadership

 

Pitt’s Black Action Society has spent
a great deal of its time this year looking
for something that many people need,
but few people have -— leadership.

As part of there quest to build a solid
base of African American leaders, the
BAS sponsored a three-day leadership
conference in February.

This third annual leadership confer-
ence attempted to take the different deﬁ-
nitions of a great leader and bring them
together to inspire and instruct students
across the campus.

Although the overall theme was
leadership, they broke it down into
smaller topics. These included
Community Building, Key Partnership
Effectiveness, and the Challenges of
Student Leadership.

Whether a leader is someone’s par-
ents, their mentor, or a great orator, like
Martin Luther King, the conference
showed that leadership means many dif-
ferent things for many different people.

For some, leadership can be dis-
played in the simplest form, by the most
common person.

For Pitt sophomore Tamika Martin,
leadership comes from touching lives
directly. She leads children by tutoring
and giving them religious counseling.
According to Martin, she has set up an
academic and motivation program for a
few children in her neighborhood home
of Toledo, Ohio.

“I’m like their mentor and they look
at me as their big sister,” says Martin.

According to Martin, she’s been
mentoring four neighborhood children
since her sophomore year of high school.
Martin says she took them on because of
their unfortunate circumstances.

“The main reason I took the kids on
was because two of them have dead par-
ents and one has both parents in jail. I’ve
set up an academic program and a moti-
vation program since they don’t have a
strong religious base,” said Martin.

She said that she spent last year men-
toring children for Christian Life Skills
here on campus. On Friday evenings
they would go to the Church of God on
Lincoln Avenue to tutor the children.
During the second hour a biblical mentor
sessions would take place. Afterwards,
they would take the children on a ﬁeld
trip, usually going bowling or skating.

Others look to more prestigious peo-
ple who lead in very complex ways.

“Leadership to me is when a promi-
nent person distinguishes himself from
society and shows that he or she is a good
role model for children}: said Robert
Zeveney, a Pitt grad student.

Zeveney is majoring Public and

Community Health Services.

“I think I will provide leadership.
through my major and career choices,”
Zeveney said.

Some Pitt students said leading-

takes more than a person just making
their presence known.

According to Charles Ducan, a Pitt.
communications major, there must be
other things besides stepping forward in
a situation to provide leadership.

“A leader is someone that can take
control of a situation, socially interact,
effectively, and has goals to guide that
group,” said Ducan,

Chandra Simpson, a Pitt sophomore,
agrees and said a person should also
guide people along.

“Leadership to me is a person who
can serve his or her people into a pros-
perous direction,” Simpson said.

Most students said that their parents
were the examples of leadership when
they were children.

Shallyn Harmon, ax Pitt sophomore,
said her parents were something for her
to use as guide.

“My parents were my leaders
because they always gave me stability in
my life,” says Harmon.

Students weren’t the only people
who probed the questions of leadership.
They also weren’t the only ones to say
that their parents were leaders.

Reﬂecting on her parents, Dr. Carla
Gary, an associate dean in Faculty of Arts
and Sciences, said she sees her mother
and father as two independent individu-
als with their own aspirations.

“I see my parents as a man and a
woman not as husband and wife. I see
my mother as a woman that gave up her
life and dreams to allows me to have
opportunities,” said Gary.

Throughout the conference the
theme of “Bridging the Gaps Between
Us,” was articulated’ by Gary.

Speaking on the topic of “Dynamics
of Relationships,” Gary relayed her
views about how men and women can
relate better.

During the “Dynamics of
Relationships” seminar, Gary said that
she would stop talking
“Generation X” and would now concen-
trate on “Generation Next.”
Emphasizing the importance of college
relationships, Gary says she believes that
good relationships are based on good
friendships.

“I think besides the relationships at
home the most important relationships
are formed at college,” said Gary.

Gary also emphasized the impor-
tance of self—esteem in leadership and
dealing with people.

dent of the OBCA. Some panhandlers went to other areas of the
city while the cans were up, he said.

Though Cecil will never ﬁrlly recover, the money raised by
these charities will help fund an experimental treatment to help
him breathe without a machine. The Cecils are planning to trav-
el to Cleveland soon to begin this therapy.

Since the breathing treatment is experimental, it is not cov-
ered by insurance. - Q

“He’s excited and nervous about the treatment.” said
Barbara Cecil, Kevin’s mother. “He realizes that it’s expe1irnen-
tal, but we are hoping.”

She said Kevin and the rest of the family are happy to hear
that the place he considered home during his college years has-
n’t forgotten him.

. “We are so thankful to Chris and everyone for what they are
doing,” said Barbara Cecil. “We are planning to use the money
to help while we are staying in Cleveland and the medical b" _ .”

Whether Cecil will ever retum to Pitt is still uncertain.

“He may take a few classes locally at ﬁrst, but it all depends
on how the treatment goes,” said Barbara Cecil.

Cecil is hoping to attend this year’s golf outing, “but again,
we have to see how the treatment goes,” said Barbara Cecil.

Unfortunately, the charity that once united Oakland while
raising money for his treatments has slowed to a near standstill.

The donation cans at local businesses were stopped because
of lack of manpower.

“All we need is about a half dozen people to collect the
donations and drop them off,” said Larry Dashefsky. “It is too
hard for me to do it alone.” ,

The OBCA is appealing to Pitt students to volunteer to col-
lect the donations once a week

Shanna Blau, the chair of the Community Relations corn-
rnittee, is now planning to get a group to take care of the cans, s
according to Jennifer Mulluso of SGB. Blau was not available
for comment

Students are encouraged to contact the SGB at 648-7970
for more information about assisting the fund drive for Cecil.

Supreme Court decision only affects three clinics in New
York and does not affect Pittsburgh abortion clinics.

According to Irwin, the ruling restricting picketers
only applied to clinics where protestors where arrested.
Since no abortion demonstrators were arrested in
Pittsburgh, there are no buffer zones at abortion clinics in
the city, she said.

‘There has never been any injunction on any abor-
tion clinic in Pittsburgh; therefore, there is no buffer
zone,” said Irwin.

Technically, that’s true, according to Itri. Q

“But, there is a law that Congress passed in 1994
called the FACE law [Freedom of Access to Clinic
Entrances]” Itri said. “It’s a federal statute guaranteeing
all women safe and legal access to a clinic entrance. If
[protestors] are at the door of the clinic, a patient can’t get
in.”

Members of Pitt’s Students for Life went to a
demonstration Saturday at the Women’s Health Services
downtown to protest because the clinic performs abor-
tions in addition to offering women’s health services.
They joined nearly- 200 protestors from other anti-abor-
tion groups. I

Protestors followed women and their escorts to the
doors of the clinic, shouting at them.

Members of the Campus Women’s Organization.

were also at the clinic. They were volunteering for the
Pittsburgh Pro-Choice Escorts. Margot Douaihy, co-pres-
ident of the CW 0, said both demonstrators and escorts
are aided by the constraints of the latest Supreme Court
ruling. _

Previously, protestors observed the buffer zone. That
day they didn’t.

“It was bad. The Antis were right behind me screarn-
ing and they went right up to the entrance with me,” said
Douaihy. “I touched that door [of the clinic entrance]. The
other escorts did too.”

“Bridging the Gap Between Us” panel, Dr.
Andrienne Andrews, agreed with Gary’s thought
that the way we look at others is usually the the
way we feel.

“I think the idea Dr. Gary mentioned of feel-
ing good about ourselves was right on point,” said
Andrews.

Lecturer Georgiana Queen, a social worker,
discussed the topics of Community Building and
Key Partnership Effectiveness.

Queen said people are looking for others that
care but problems arise when people don’t care.

“The reason many communities are falling by
the wayside is because the people within them
don’t pull their resources together,” said Queen.

The students learned about leadership just in
putting the conference together.

The conference was coordinated by Sean K.
Stalling, the Black Active Students Intercollegiate
Struggle chairman. Stallings is the chairman of
that organization. ’

BASICS corresponds with students here and
African American Student organizations within
the region.

Aisha Anderson, a BAS member, said she
thinks Stallings and the BASICS committee did a
good job of leading the conference.

“I was impressed with the way conference
was run. We [steering committee] didn’t have that
large of a role in the conference because Sean and
his committee took care of it,” Anderson said.

Martin said that an appreciation for each other
is gained from the contributions of those involved.

“Steel Impressions and the Black Dance
Workshop show that organizations can come
together and give something positive back to stu-
dents,” said Martin.

Protestors have no business inside

A February 19 Supreme
Court ruling allows two abortion
protestors to enter the buffer
zone, the area in which abortion
protestors had not been allowed
to enter before, and to walk with
the patient up to the clinic door.

The decision was a compro-
mise between keeping the 15-
foot buffer zone surrounding a
clinic door completely impene-
trable and allowing the buffer
zone to become movable so that
protestors could surround a
patient as she entered or exited a
clinic.

This is an unacceptable com-
promise. The point of the buffer

THE PITT NEWS

  

zone is to protect the safety of
the patient. Even with the buffer
zone, it was necessary to insti-
tute a practice of having patients
accompanied by pro-choice
escorts to get them through the
mobs of protestorsthat generally
surround a clinic.

Now, two protestors can’

accompany a patient along with
two escorts. This is inviting
trouble. The debate surrounding
abortion tends to get rather heat-
ed, and that heated debate has
already led to several deaths.

'~ -4-..  . .9:-»:«ot-Jo. . ’-J». .- *.~.-.- ,.-..~ .-2-. :'\. :»:- .-:«>.6:I.'I¢

Violence has erupted at- clinics_ .

when the buffer zone served as a
barrier. Now, that barrier is vir-
tually nonexistent.

Members of the pro—life
movement consider the buffer
zone an infringement on their
first amendment rights.
However, as long as they stood
15 feet away from the clinic
door when the buffer zone was
impenetrable, they could hold
signs and protest abortion in a
manner that was clearly audible
and visible to those entering the

clinic. If the noise and posters
aren’t enough, to dissuade a
woman from having an abortion,
what other means do the protes-
tors intend to use within the
buffer zone? Perhaps a pistol-
packing pro—lifer will make good
use of the new found freedom.
This decision is a serious

threat not only to those women ‘

who seek a legal abortion from a
reputable clinic, but also to
those who are seeking other ser-
vices from clinics which also
happen to perform abortions.
Perhaps the Supreme Court
should rethink its reasoning on
this one. I

Fossilized dinosaur eggs in
Pisdur, India, and the University
of Pittsburgh. Quick: what’s the
connection? Yes, both were fea-
tured in The Pitt News ' last
Thursday, two seemingly dis-
parate items. A short item ﬁ'om
the “Around the World” section
told how the villagers of Pisdur
had been tripping over some both-
ersome rocks which they had
attempted to plow into their wheat
and cotton ﬁelds, when a bunch of
excited archaeologists showed up
and removed the offending
objects for them — over 300

dinosaur eggs from the -
Cretaceous period.
Archaeologists hope that the ﬁnd

may help them discover the rea-
sons for the extinction of the
dinosaurs.

A lengthy article in the same
edition of the paper last week
detailed a situation in the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs. Apparently,
the students have a professor,
Rajen Mookerjee, who draws 30
to 40 students in his economics
lectures where most lecturers of
same can only draw about 4 or 5.
Dr. M'ooke1jee currently holds a
part-time position in the school.
When a full—tirne position became
vacant, students felt that as an out-
standing lecturer who is involved
in current research, Dr.
Mookerjee should be recruited to
a full-time position.

Butthis is not the way things
are done at the University of
Pittsburgh. No, that would be too
simple, and besides, what would
they do with all the recruiting
money in the budget? Spend it on
extra computers or something?

Heaven forfend. Instead, the job
was advertised and received over
300 applicants. Naturally, in order

to deal with this volume, a search .

committee was organized to sift
the wheat from the chaff.. Dr.
Mookerjee must be chaff, because
he is not a ﬁnalist. Of the ﬁve
ﬁnalists picked by the search
committee, only two currently
hold a Ph.D. degree, and three do
not have teaching experience.
Hello? Hello? Is there any intelli-
gent life out there? The lights are
on, but nobody is home at the
University of Pittsburgh.

Mayhap one day in the misty
future, some new kind of cyber
villager will trip over a different
kind of dinosaur egg. Otherwise
known as the Cathedral of
Learning, sometimes referred to
as the Tower of Ignorance, this
deco dinosaur is home to a bigger,
even more invidious dinosaur. As
an educational institution, Pitt is a
parody of itself. Hamstmng by
more bureaucracy than the even
the Federal Government, students
must constantly suffer through
apparently stupid and meaning-
less procedures and rules.

The story of Dr. Mookerjee
typiﬁes this serious defect. Failing
to hire a professor who can draw
800 percent more students to his
lectures than any of his colleagues
seems to this impersonal observer
to be an act of gross stupidity at
best and possibly gross negli-
gence at worse. Call me a cynic,
but I have to wonder how many
of the those “other” economics
professors — the ones whose
voices echo around empty halls
—— have become a little insecure
and perhaps overanxious about
ﬁlling the post without any
appearance of s —— yeech! --
patronage:

But in _a way, one can sympa-
thize with the poor bureaucrats.
After all, here they are, trying to
rim a university, yet they are con-
stantly being bothered by stu-
dents, complaining about every-

thing from the food to the teach-

ing. It carmot help but be noticed,
by long-time members of the stu-
dent body, that the University is
usually ineﬁicient at everything
except taking one’s money —— that
they seem to manage rather well.

It’s just another case in which
it appears that the university is
never able to move with speed,
ﬂexibility, and intelligence. It
moves as usual, with about as
much grace as a dinosaur on
downers. And it treats students
just like the villagers treated the
fossilized eggs. As an armoying
inconvenience to be crushed,
buried, or shoved out of the way.
Despite this, I read that our new
chancellor is anxious to increase
alumni giving.

Well, listen up,_ Chancellor
Nordenberg. When the University
shows the same alacrity for listen-
ing to students as it does for tak-
ing their money, maybe alumni
giving will increase in an expo-
nential fashion. As for me, I
expect to continue sulking about
my personal beefs with the
University for several years after
graduation, and as for the other
beefs which other students have
written about in this paper, I
imagine they’ll be sulking for
quite a while, too. So get back
into bed with American Express;
at least they aren’t sulking.
They’ve got more money, any-
way. '

Senior Night marks yet
another loss for Pitt

Patrick Robertson

 

' The Pitt women’s basketball
team kept their streak alive by losing
the 13th of their last 14 games, drop-
ping last night’s game to St. John’s,
66-54. .

By losing this game, the Lady
Panthers dropped themselves into the
13th and final seed in the Big East
Tournament.

Since this was the last home
game of the year, it was also Senior
Night for Melissa Thompson and
Kelly Senneca, who played their last
games in Fitzgerald Field House. Pitt
Head Coach Kirk Bruce said,

 

.“Sometimes the emotion of Senior
Night can work against you.”

Apparently, that is part of what
happened last night. The Lady Red
Storm just outplayed the Lady
Panthers in all facets of the game.
Pitt did not hustle or seem to have
their usual enthusiasm. St. John’s
beat them to countless loose balls and
outworked them for even more
rebounds. Bruce said, “We just didn’t
have it all night.”

Things looked good for Pitt early
when freshman Michelle Katkowski
hit a three-pointer to start- the game.
The first half was a see-saw battle
and ended with a 28-25 Pitt lead at

 

 

THE FEW. THE
PROUD. THE AWOL.

 

Last week, the govemment’s most
publicized weapon since the Stealth
Bomber was discontinued.

The unit was grossly over budget,
padded with layers of unnecessary
fuel, and easily years past its prime.
At first the government didn’t mind,
but three days after the preliminary
stage concluded, the weapon took
itself off-line.

Yes, Riddick Bowe has left the
Marine Corps.

It was a shock to nobody. For
some reason, an overweight, wealthy
boxer approaching 30 years of age
was not fully equipped to handle boot
camp at Parris Island —— a training
base that turns away a large percent-
age of healthy, young volunteers.

Bowe’s manager, Rock Newman,
was quick to fan the ﬂames of public-
relations wreckage, saying that he
knew his fighter wasn’t cut out for the
Corps, and that he doubted that
Riddick would ever fight again.

Who would have guessed that a
publicity stunt engineered by an old
boxer and the United States govern-
ment would fail miserably?

Originally, the idea was for Bowe
to become a Marine reservist — free
to continue to fight as a living, breath-
ing commercial for the armed ser-
vices. He could trainat military bases.
He could recruit at schools. He could
pose in his dress uniform on posters,
carefully airbrushed to remove some
of his unsightly 260—plus pounds.

Bowe has said he’s always
dreamed of entering the service, but
nothing was made of it publicly until
after the November Holyfield—Tyson
fight. When Commander Vander
became “heavyweight champion,
Bowe’s name gained credence in the
heavyweight circle. After all, he’d
beaten Holyfield in two out of their
three fights, including a knockout win
in the most recent encounter.

Imagine it — Riddick Bowe,
world heavyweight champion and
dedicated U.S. soldier. Young fight
fans would be lined up to join the
Corps. Marine recruiters would have
the easiest job on the planet.

Evidently, some bureaucrat saw

Kellii Taylor’s two free
throws with 1.4 seconds left
helped Pitt hold off Connecticut
last night 77-74, as the Panthers
won only their second Big East
road game all year.

Free throw shooting was
key as the Panthers were 6-6 in
the final 22 seconds.

“Tonight we stepped up,
concentrated, and knocked
down the free throws,” said
guard Vonteego Cummings.

Cummings not only
knocked down the free throws,
but did everything else well last
night, too. He led the team in
scoring with 21, and rebound-
ing with nine. He also had six
assists and three steals.

 

Panthers 69-60 lead with just
over five minutes left, but the
Huskies battled back as Richard
Hamilton scored seven of his
game-high 31 points to close
the gap to 71-69 with 40 sec-
onds remaining.

UConn was forced to foul
and Kevin Willard hit two free
throws with 22 seconds left to
keep Pitt in front 73-69. Ricky
Moore cut the lead to two with
14 seconds remaining, and the
Huskies were forced to foul
again. Cummings hit both foul
shots but Hamilton responded
with a three—pointer to cut the
Panther lead to one with 2.6
seconds remaining.

Taylor’s free throws then
sealed Pitt‘s first win on the
road since beating Georgetown

UConn held a 36-35 lead at
halftime, but the Panthers went
on an 11-2 run midway through
the second half as Gerald
Jordan’s dunk put Pitt up 60-52.

The teaming of the 6-foot-
10-inch Jordan and 7-foot cen-
ter Mark Blount caused UConn
problems all night as Blount
scored 16 points and Jordan had
12.

Blount hit Pitt’s first six
points of the night, and UConn
had even more problems inside
when center Jake Voskuhl
picked up his third foul of the
night less than a minute into the
second half.

“Establishing an inside
game is critical to the offense,”
said Coach Willard.

The Pitt men’s and women’s

The Mobil meet is a major
national meet. In the past, it has
attracted track superstars such as
Jackie Joyner—Kersee and Michael
Johnson. The 1997 lineup featured

the meet.

Pitt’s representation
at the meet consisted
almost entirely of relay

tance medley relay
team.

time of 3:16.81.

The only Panther invited to com-
pete at the meet in an individual
event was Trecia Smith. Smith
cleared 5--8 3/4 in the high jump.
The mark put her in fifth place over-
all, second among collegiate ath-
letes.

Pitt really missed junior Latia
Howard in the first half. She exited
after two and a half minutes with two
fouls. She did not return until the sec-
ond half.

St. Johns came out storming after
the break and went up 42-35. After
this, Pitt could not come back. They
had a small surge of power led by
Katkowski to get them back within
ten, but they could not do anything
more, and they bowed out. Bruce
said, “We couldn’t do the little
things.” -

In her 17 minutes, Howard fin-
ished with 13, just behind her team-
mate Farrah Woods, who had 14.

For the Red Storm, LaTricia
Gunnells controlled the game and fin-
ished with 18 points. Andrijana
Bedalov added 16 in the win.

The Panthers just did not climb
out of the hole they dug and didn’t
really play well for the length of the
game.'They hope to get things turned
around at the end of this week.

The Lady Panthers do not play
again until the Big East Tournament
later this week. Look for a preview in

Inside game coming of age

ﬁCorey.B|auch

   

The inside game of the Panthers
was like an Eskimo commanding his
Huskies through the two foot snow.
Mark Blount, Gerald Jordan, and Chad
Varga were like Nanook of the North
keeping the Huskies out of the paint.

Connecticut could not find the
answer for the big three. Mark Blount
finished the game with sixteen points.
The 7—footer was five for five in the
first half. Jordan had 12 points and
Varga added four.

“Establishing an inside game is
critical,” said a proud Ralph Willard
following the win.

In the first play of the game, the
Panthers went straight to the inside as
Blount scored over UConn’s freshman
center Jake Voshkul. They continued
to pound the inside of the Huskies’
defence throughout the first half, but
the Panthers were still behind at the
half, 36-35.

In the second half Pitt mixed
things up by going inside, shooting
perimeter shots, and penetrating to

keep the UConn defense guessing.
The interior game of the Panthers
made the Huskies honest, which
caused them to play off the Panther
guards a bit. This got Pitt some good
looks and they fired away and made
53 percent of their shots. It also
allowed Cummings to blow through
the defence and take the Huskies to
obedience school.

“Well, the key is, if you establish
an inside game, you can open the out-
side up,” said Willard.

“Mark had confidence and once he
established the inside, we got more
looks,” said Cummings — the leading
point scorer of the night

Pitt has improved on their offen-
sive movement all around and have
eliminated the stagnant game that they
have fallen into at times this year.

The UConn defence is not any-
thing to sneeze at. Before last night,
they had not let any team shoot higher
than 45 percent against them all year.

This was a huge win for the
Panthers who must keep the ball
rolling if they want to do well in the
“up for grabs” Big East Tournament.

Hoops

Willard was also impressed with
his team’s inspired play, saying, “We
played with emotion for the first time
since_the Georgetown game. Tonight
we did that and hopefully we can do
that for the rest of the year.”

Last night’s win was especially
important as the Panther’s gear up for
the end of the regular season. They
will close out the conference schedule

at Syracuse and then head to New
York City for the Big East

Tournament. The team will probably ‘

need to win the tournament in order to
gain an NCAA birth and in order to do
that they must learn to win away from
Pittsburgh.

“You have to develop a road men-
tality,” Coach Ralph Willard said,
“and we did that [last night].”

the same picture — a fighter dying to
be a Marine and a belt that’s his for the
taking. Mr. Publicity added two and
two to get a quite simple four and set
up the press conference.

Everything looked smooth. But,
just when you thought it was safe to
hold your gloves above your waist 

America’s military endeavors
were sabotaged by a Polish heavy-
weight with a criminal record. Andrew
“The Slavic Sensation” Golota fol-
lowed up his disqualification—loss to
Bowe early in 1996 with another dis-
qualification—loss in December 1996.
The second one didn’t end in a riot, but
it was still an ugly sight, at least from
Bowe’s vantage point.

Some would say that Golota
crushed his opponent’s spirit; all who
watched would say that he crushed
something a bit more important than
his opponent’s spirit. When the Marine
physician told Bowe to turn his head
and cough, the fighter probably

‘ FROM PAGE 8

screamed louder than a beauty contes-
tant set up on a blind date with Mike
Tyson.

Injured pride or no, Bowe was still
up for the challenge. For three days, he
underwent Marine basic training as
buck private, not sports superstar. On
the fourth day, he came back to his
senses, went home to his mansion, and
slept in past 4:30 reveille.

Did the Marines get good press for
staying tough on the celebrity recruit‘?
No. If anything, they got bad press for
sliding the boxer past age and weight
restrictions.

Mr. Publicity is probably cleaning V

out his office as you read. Leave it to
the unholy alliance of Polish crimi-

nals, marine discipline, and the

celebrity lifestyle to ruin an old—fash—
ioned media stunt.
