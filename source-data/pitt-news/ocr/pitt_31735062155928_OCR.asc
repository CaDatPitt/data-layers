'Cur’e ' Na t Possible No w

By JOHN De NINNO V

Repetition of an unfortunate incident which occurred
19 years ago is not possible with the vaccine developed here
by Dr. Jonas E. Salk, according to an article in the Feb. 5
edition of Collier’s magazine. In 1935 six people. died and
a number developed polio after being injected with one of
two supposed polio cures (they were not developed here)._

Top men in the medical work are backing Pitt’s p0l1O
vaccine. In‘separate statements the United States Health
Service and the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis
have defended the vaccine after commentator Walter Win-
chell, in a coast to coast radio and television broadcast

' Sunday, charged that it may be “a killer not a cure.”

C

Winchell contended that live virus were found in seven
‘out of ten batches of the_vaccine tested by the U. S. Public
.Health Service. '

He said “It (the vaccine) "killed several monkeys-the
Polio Foundation is trying to kill the story—but the United
States Public Health Service will conﬁrm it in ten days. _

Not waiting ten. days to conﬁrm the story the _Public
Health Service denied it almost» immediately. It said that
if any positives are found in the vaccine it would not be
released for mass immunization. . _

Dr. Salk admitted knowing that there were live virus
in several of the batches he had sent to the  S.,Public
Health labs. He said that the batches were inadequately
treated and were sent to the ,labs in‘ the hopes that l‘1‘ve
larvae would be found so that they could be studied.‘ In

effect,” he said, “we were testing the tests.” ._

First to answer Winchell’s charge was the Polio Foun-
dation. Dr. Hart E. Van Riper, medical director of the_foun-
dation, said, “Any product that contains live virus 1S not
the vaccine developed by Salk and is to be tested by the

National Foundation.”

Boon to Activities

Class schedules will be set up

"on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Whén
speaking of-the decision to leave

dent activities.-” '

This is the ﬁrst time since pre-
war days that Pitt students have
had a free period. During the war

the practice was discontinued due
to,an insufﬁcient number of class
rooms.

Dean Biddle expressed the pos- '

sibility that fraternities might

"After reviewing y-our case we're. s'I'i|I in a quandry
. . . Mind ‘stepping around here for a moment?"

Aim titer Record a

,Arnold Air‘ Society and the cadets and officers of the
AFROTC set a record last week for the number of .,blood
donations in a single day at the Red Cross Blood Center.
Transporting the_donors to and from the Blood Bank, the
Society had a total of 160' donors giving blood during the
day. The success of this drive and several previous ones
during the year is a laudable achievement for the organiz-
ers and participants. When the War ended,,the need, for
plasma was not nearly so great but the many wounded vet-
erans in hospitals throughout the country were still under-
going treatments that required large quantities of precious

._whole blood. Aspinwall VA hospital needsconstant sup-
plies of the fresh ‘blood and their main supply course is
the gifts of civilian donors. The Air Force Cadets and the
‘officers and enlisted men of the detachment here have re-
sponded frequently and wholeheartedly in this emergency
and their efforts should‘ not go unnoticed. - '

Tiiere Are, Those. . .

A nice touch was added to the election campaign the A

other day when a student questioned a candidate about, his
platform slogan on some campaign literature. Quite ‘frankly,
‘the aspiring politician had no knowledge of what his plat-
form entailed. He said he’ wanted to pxximote something
but he didn’t know how or what or by What means. He
groped blindly forimportant sounding phrases that became

~ ridiculous as he repeated them like a record and ﬁnally ad-

mitted that he wasn’t quite sure what he was doing. Many
of the candidates are in the same boat. They don’t know
what they are doing or why they are running except that
it looks like fun, it might make them popular, or they were
told to do it by a friend. ’
There are many sincere aspirants for positions and they
have sensible, logical, and laudable goals which they are
earnestly trying to achieve. When you vote today, pick
out these good men and women from the slates and obscurity
of the independent ranks and vote for them. Whether you
are freshman or senior, your ‘common sense and native in-
telligence will help you in choosing and electing these peo-

' ple and your maturity should enable you to see the reason

behind electing capable people rather than glory-hounds

‘ . and/or childish politicians.

Spring Hat Pitt is...

Spring, with its annual arrival-

You Wrote‘ On My Slate...

Parties and Politicians

By Irv Rofhman

Not since,1952 when the un-
derrated _ M e r it Party over-
whelmed the heavily favored;IF-
supported “Integrity Foremost
Party” has so much interest been
raised over Student Government
elections. But this time, it took
a scathing split in IF council
itself to stimulate interest.

Mostlof the candidates running
‘on the “Pitt Party” slate hail

from fraternities which still Hail .
to Pitt IF council. Insurgent fra-f

"ternity ‘members have cast their
lots in the “Panther Party” and
will attempt to defend their
honor in Student Congress, Men’s
Council and male class ofﬁcer po-
sitions. There are a few, but a
very few, independents on the

C slates.'_ '

So the halls are again littered
with campaign bulletins, litho-
graphed index cards, and an un-
usually large amount of, newly-
found friends. Yet, the two party
system has-stirred up much more

interest than thehempty polls at- v A politely

  

tested last year.

However, the exciting atmos-_‘

phere, which will hardly be
touched by significant Scholars’
Day, has a few dark spots that
bear somellight. And those are
mainly. independents—very inde-
pendent who are runnin g futilely
and only because they have al-
ready submitted petitions for

' candidacy. Most have found no

place in the party slates since
fraternities ‘are controlling fac-
tors.‘ The individualists can’t even
claim places in parties similar to

the Good Humor Party or Merit -

Party of two years ago, which
also had. a great many fraterni-
ty people but were open to all.
The ﬁght this year is among the

Greek brothers.

' Noteworthy enough, women
students arepon neither the Pitt
nor Panther‘ Party slates———that is,
not visually on the rosters. A
primary reason--recently, each
sorority president was called into
the deanaof women’s"- office and

     

asked ‘to discourage .

  

in war. Publication of the facts about drugs made
them understandable to the people. I

They were and are wonder drugs, available and
effective for most people, but the hue and cry
aroused by mis—use and blind unreasoning threat-
ened their early existence- _

Now we are beset by similar problems and
F.D.R. and his statement of having “nothing to
fear but fear itself’? are appropriate.
unreasoning fear——is our most dangerous and pow-
erful enemy. Nothing is to be gained by jumping.
-to conclusions and gulping water glasses full of_
whiskey to the accompaniment of moaning and,
prostrate sobbing. ' A

This old world has weathered some miserable’
times that have, at that moment, threatened our
lives or our very civilization. Let’s not give up
our“ faith in Man-—yet. ‘

Fear, blind,

and may be seen galloping fever-
ishly through the halls in search
of prospective votes. Still others
adopt the habits of the Hum-
mingbird and ﬂit from student to

student, extracting votes as uno _

erringly as their prototype ex-
tracts honey. '
My Aching Back

The Politico is a pretty fair
hopper too. At parties, dinners
and other social aﬁairs,__he may
be found hopping from table to
table muttering “I don’t believe
I know you . ._.” He is a verita-

ble cigarette machine and always «

holds a lighted match in his hand.
Some of these birds actually

take an interest in the eggs they ;

‘lay, however, and will sit on
them until they hatch. The gov-
ernment ‘has fenced oﬁ a huge
game preserve for these birds,
where they may mingle with
their own kind, relativlely unmo-
lested by man. I think they call
it Washington. A

there’s talk of sorority\ women

material, but, after all, 60 women

The big advantage of resumed

Survey To Seek Extent

 

Of G13, ’MemoryA bility

A survey to determine the amount of retention of mili-
tary knowledge will soon be conducted among ex—servicemen

in the Pittsburgh district. ,

The study will be conducted under the direction of Pitt
psychologist, Dr. Harry W. Braun, for the department of the

Army’s Human Resources
George Washington University.
The study has a three fold pur-
pose. First, the examination will
serve to compile information on

. the amount of military knowledge
' among veterans and the success of

past training programs. _
Second,‘the results of the test

will be instrumental in determin-

ing how much of this training can

‘be relied upon in the event of a
- national emergency. Finally, this"

test will reveal necessary retrain-
ing to prepare a veteran for activ
duty. '

All ex-servicemen enrolled at
Pitt are being" requested by let-
ter to cooperate in the study. The‘
test will be in questionnaire form
and will require about two hours
for completion. A

Dr. Braun pointed out that the
results of the test will have ab-
solutely no bearing on the in-
dividual eX—serviceman’s future.

The study, if successful, will be
carried to other parts of the coun-
try‘. .

Dawson Al-s o—W‘orks In

Single Wing Formations

: . By DAVE MAZER; . _
Yep, it’s the same -old story. Red Dawson is again at

his favorite task——switching fotball players from one posi-

tion \tO another.

With spring drills just one week gone, the Panther coach
has already changed more backs and linemen than observers

at practice can keep up with.

Following a plan of experimentation that might prompt

the Pitt fan to get a scorecard this°

fall, Dawson apparently reasons

‘that the spring is only to get ac-

quainted with the abilities of his

players and so, accordingly, will

try many new combinations.
A Ford to Halfback

To date, eight changes have been
noted. Probably the most -talked
about was the shifting of Henry
Ford, last season’s regular quar—
terback, to a halfback position last

‘Another innovation was the ap-

practice scrimmages. ‘This move
gave fact to the rumor that Daw-
son plans more single wing, buck

cause the unequal line usually
means a more varied offense.

Pitt, Holds Own

' West Virginia’s crack riﬂe team

' shot the Panthers by a slim 10

An even split in the ﬁrst two games of the -season does
not sound like anything to rave about, on the surface, but
it amounts to a booming start for Sarge Mitterling’s dia-
mond corps when you consider the opposition. ‘

The Quantico Marine squad which the locals beat last
Saturday, after dropping a tough one the previous day, boasts
a solid lineup of players with experience in organized ball.
Jack Thomas, the pitcher whom the Mittmen tagged in Sat-
urday’s win, is a good example. The Boston Red Sox farm-

hand starred for the Marines last year when they won the

all—service championship by posting a 20-3'record.

Some of their second line pitchers, though not ex-
perienced minor leaguers, had nevertheless proved their
mettle in college play. The Panthers treated them with
equal disrespect. _ .

Probably the greatest ’advantage the Marines held,
though, was their previous experience this spring. They
had alreadyplayed seven games against high minor league
teams before moving up from Florida. '

* * 5|:

Assistant Trainer Roger McGill, who made the trip
south, reported seeing three familiar faces at Quantico; Sam
Rago,_ last year’s second baseman; Bobby Lewis, outﬁeld
star of three years ago, who is recuperating from» an opera-
tion; and Scotty Phillips, the basketball sub’ who tossed in a
last-second ﬁeld goal to upset West Virginia in the last game
at the Stadium Pavilion. All are stationed at the base.

Any readers unfortunate enough to have stumbled
across this page Apr. 1 may have noticed the story?
reporting the outlawing of college referees and coaches

too many officials.” V '

Thus the local sharpshooters

The opposition got a break when
one of their men who usually ﬁres

kept Jim M’cKowen out of action

out too, things could be tough.

In addition to the injured hur-

In the Feb. 5 issue of Collier’s

their disposal; in 1935 there Awas
no such ﬁnancial backing.. The

There are hundreds of research--
