Pittdrops in national rankings

Marissa Meredyth
Staff Writer

4 Many prospective college students turn to
popular school-ranking publications to sim-

plify a hard decision. These lisﬁngs have the
potential to change their opinion about Pitt.

College and university rankings often
come in the form of a number or letter that
dramatically simpliﬁes the many different
aspects that make up an education, yet many
students continue to place emphasis on these
scores when deciding which schools to apply
to and eventually attend.

The University fell from 56th to 64th in US
News & World Report’s Best Colleges 2011 in

the category of National Universities.

Pitt seniorjacob Brett, a politics and phi-
losophy major in the Honors College, said he
deﬁnitely remembers looking at rankings. But

just because he looked doesn’t mean they were
a decisive factor in his choice.

“I think I got some book, The Princeton Re-
view’s Best Colleges,” Brett said. “I had been to
D.C. before and liked it, so I applied to George
Washington University and American Univer-
sity in addition to Pitt.”

He got into George Washington, American
and Pitt, he said. George Washington was too
expensive, so his choice became between Pitt
‘and American. . '

Brett said that he asked the opinions of
teachers he really respected in high school

to help make that choice. They all said to go
to Pitt. This year, US News ranked American
79th. '

As described on its website, the organiza-
tion ranks colleges and universities to help
students “make one of the most important
decisions of [their] life,” and that the rankings
should just be one tool for selecting a college
— not something upon which a student should
rely «solely. ,

“I’m pretty satisﬁed with Pitt,” Brett said,
“Sometimes I wish I was in a bigger city and
being a political science major in D.C. may
have been better. But, it is easier to network
here which has opened a lot of doors for me

New drive 
recycles
batteries  

Olivia Garber
Staﬁ Writer

The incident that inspired Pitt graduate stu-
dent Kristen Ostermann to pilot an ongo-
ing battery-recycling campaign on campus
started as a joke.

Ostermann said she was about 7 years
old when she saw her friend take a remote
with a missing battery cover and press it to
the side of her face, pretending to make a
phone call. Old batteries, crusted with cor-
rosive acid, seared the cheek of her friend,
Ostermann said.

As she watched her friend’s face break
out in a harsh rash, she realized, “Whoa, that

‘ sh*t’s dangerous.” 7

Now a graduate student at the Swanson
School of Engineering, Ostermann is the driv-
ingforce behind abattery-recycling campaign
funded by a grant from the Mascaro Center
for Sustainable Innovation.

Ten locations on campus have containers

speciﬁcally for recycling batteries, which '

Facilities Management collects.

Ostermann said that four days after plac-
ing the containers out, some had already
ﬁlled to the brim. .

The idea for this project came shortly af-
ter ‘Ostermann transferred to Pitt. She had
become accustomed to the luxury of recy-
cling batteries at her old school, Worcester
Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, and
was surprised to learn that Pitt didn’t offer
the same services. _ .

She asked around, but professors and stu-

Lack of recycling on campus prompts program

dents gave the same response; ”‘Uh
 I give them to CMU‘?”’

For Ostermann, that wasn’t
going to cut it. Rather than let the

damaged remains of batteries in- .

ﬁltrate Pittsburgh’s landﬁlls and
water systems, Ostermann began
planning for a battery—recycling
campaign.

“I saw what [batteries] did to
someone’s face — I don’t want to
drink that,” Ostermann said.

Ostermann’s research adviser
Amy Landis encouraged her to

apply for the $2000 grant,
sponsored by MCSI.

Landis, who is a faculty member
at the Civil and Environmental En-
gineering program, said she pushed
Ostermann to apply, not only be-
cause she was interested in battery
recycling, but also because it ﬁt in
with the research for her Ph.D.

Ostermann’s research focuses

.,.on life cycle analysis applied to end-
of-life materials.

Laura Schaefer, deputy director

at MCSI, called Ostermann’s carn-

paign a “good idea.” She anticipates

that this program will increase both
the number of batteries recycled
and awareness about battery re-
cycling.

Many people are aware that bat-
teries should be recycled, but no
one knows what to do with them,’
Schaefer said. g

Landis hopes that battery recy-
cling will increase signiﬁcantly on
campus and said that Ostermann
will work with Facilities Manage-
ment to get a ﬁnal tally once the
campaign is over. There is no ﬁxed
end date for the campaign, but Os-

termann plans to present some of
her results, at an engineering and
sustainability conference in April.
The actual consequence of toss-
ing away batteries isn’t known for
sure, but in Ostermann’s opinion,
it’s best to err on the side of cau-
tion.
“We don’t know if it’s bad, but it
could be bad,” Ostermann said.
The Environmental Protection
Agency website says that batteries

can contain chemicals like cadmi- .

um, lead and mercury, which can be
harmful to human health.

Because it’s hard to predict
where the batteries that aren’t
recycled will end up, ‘Landis said,
knowing the exact damage to the
environment isn’t possible. The bat-
teries could end up in a well-lined
landﬁll and remain relatively safe,
or they could fall into a more shoddy
landﬁll and release toxic chemicals
into the soil and water.

But for advocates, the off-chance
that the batteries won’t do any harm
does not erase their potential to

personally.” V

Data used for these rankings was collected
during the spring and summer of 2 010 by Com-
mon‘ Data Set, an initiative which describes
itselfas a combined effort of the College Board,
Peterson’s, and US News 8: «World Report to
research higher education institutions.

“The combined goal of this collaboration is

-to improve the quality and accuracy of infor-

mation provided to all involved in a student’s
transition into higher education,” the Common
Data Set website said.

Even so, Pitt freshman Scott Salo said, “I
don’t pay attention to rankings. I chose Pitt
because of'its name recognition out of state.”

Salo had not heard of Pitt’s fall in rankings
this year and did not think it mattered.

“It will make it easier for me to get a job with

an education from Pitt then’ if I graduated from V ‘E
a school no employer has heard of, despite what
' A number it is ranked,” Salo said. -

US News & World Report used this data
to place schools in four categories: National
Universities, National Liberal Arts Colleges,
Regional Universities and Regional Colleges.
Pitt is considered one of the National Universi-
ties, of which there are 262 total —— 164 public,
98 private. These universities offer ﬁill ranges
of undergraduate majors, as well as masters
and doctoral degrees, many of which empha-
size research. ’

Of top public universities, Pitt ranks 23rd,
a drop from 20th last year.

National,_Universities are ranked by seven
main categories: academic reputation, student
selectivity, faculty resources, graduation and
retention rates, ﬁnancial resources, alumni
giving and graduation rate performance.

Many of these weighted categories also have

subfactors within that determi_ne the weight
of the main category. Academic reputation is
determined by two subfactors: a peer assess-
ment survey which counts for two-thirds of the

score and high school counselor rating score '

which accounts for the remaining third.

Peer assessment rates how a school is re- , ,

garded by administrators at peer institutions.
The US News 8: World Report determines the

scores by surveying the presidents, provosts

' and deans of admissions. . ‘
They are asked to rate peer schools’ un- 2

dergraduate academic programs on a scale of r i

one: marginal to ﬁve: distinguished. The sur- ,

_ vey conducted in spring 2010 was completed A

by 48;percent of those surveyed, the same as . !'

completed it the previous year. ‘V

damage the environment.
“You can’t just throw these things away,”
Landis said. .

Recycling batteries will not just reduce
the amount of toxic chemicals dumped in
the ground, it will also cut down on energy
waste, Schaefer said.

Reusing the metallic wrappers — the only
recyclable part of the battery — reduces the
amount of energy needed to produce the bat-
teries. The chemicals inside the battery are
sequestered so they can’t leak into the envi-

ronment, Schaefer said. i
Ostermann is hoping the recycling effort
will boost Pitt’s overall “green score.”

She said that Pitt doesn’t have a reputa-
tion for being very environmentally friendly,
and she plans on seeing if placing recycling
containers in high-traffic areas would con-
tribute to people’s overall perception of Pitt’s
greenness.

As for now, Ostermann is basking in the
immediate gratiﬁcation of making a differ-
ence. Actions to save the environment don’t

always get an immediate impact, Ostermann
said, but seeing the containers ﬁll with batter-
ies gives her a sense of accomplishment.

“I’m doing good, instead of just writing
papers,” Ostermann said.

Batteries can be recycled at Sutherland,
Trees Hall, Lothrop, Benedum, Litchﬁeld
Tower A, the William Pitt Union, the Ca-
thedral of Learning, David Lawrence Hall,

Crawford Hall and Posvar Hall. Any form of '

battery, including iPod, laptop and camera
batteries can be recycled. I

lnsports, discrimination not
as harmful as sickle cell trait

Death or discrimination. Which would you
rather risk?

The NCAA created a new requirement
that all Division I athletes be screened for
sickle-cell trait, most commonly found in
African-Americans. Although critics of the
test worry it could cause discrimination and
limit recruiting opportunities for people
who carry the trait, the fact that complica-
tions from sickle-cell trait can be so easily
prevented seems to make the screening
worthwhile. _ U

Some medical experts argue that exer—
cise might seriously harm athletes with the
trait. Some have died.

CNN reports that nine collegiate foot-
ball players’ deaths have been related to
sickle-cell trait since 2000, making exer—
tional sickling the leading cause of death
in NCAA football players this decade.” But
“the medical ﬁeld is divided over whether

there isenough evidence to warrant the
‘Y mass screenings,” because the way the trait

is related to the deaths is.“unclear,” CNN V

reports. ' r .

tentially ensure he isn’t denied any op-

trait. _ _

Regardless of whether the sickle-cell
trait and intense exercise combination was
a direct cause of student-athlete deaths or
not, the results of testing are not supposed
to exclude students from sport participa-
tion. The NCAA website provides fact sheets
for both students and coaches on sickle-cell
trait and how to prevent a collapse. The
sheets include symptoms to watch out for
and advice such as refraining from intense
exercise when sick. '

a settlement between Rice University in
Houston and the parents of college football
player Dale Lloyd, whose death in 2006 .
was tied to sickle-cell trait, according to
the NCAA’s website.

Because the new genetic screening rule
was the result of a lawsuit against a uni-
iifiersity, critics of the requirement argue
that the screening is for the protection of
the universities and not the protection of
the athletes. But why does this matter?

MOVIE COLUMN

Andy Tybout
Assistant A&E Editor

. It’s an oft-stated truism that, compared to the
toil of an artistic career, the job of a critic is
cushy and risk free. To compensate, a critic
must sometimes lay his credibility on the
line by endorsing a controversial work of
art. Today, I champion the 2003 cinematic
gem .“'I?he Room.”

First, a quick disclaimer: I’m not going
to contend that “The- Room” is at all a good

movie. In fact, quite the opposite — I’m here‘

to proclaim, deﬁnitively, that “The Room” is

the worst ﬁlm ever made, and for this reason
alone, it’s worth our attention.

A bit of background: “The Room” is the

pet project of Tommy Wiseau, a man with a

’ jet-black, heavy metal haircut and an accent

reminiscent of Eastern Europe, a rare clue to

his history as he’s divulged almost no details

about his past. When I say pet project, I mean

it in an all-encompassing sense that is almost

unheard of in today’s movie industry —— Wi-
seau wrote, directed, produced and starred
in the ﬁlm. ’

To put it kindly, he may have overesti-
mated his expertise. , '

Originally marketed as a drama in the style
of Tennessee Williams’ works, “The Room”
tells the story of a love triangle between

Johnny, played by Wiseau himself, attempt-
_ing to be quintessentially American, — his

ﬁancee Lisa and his best friend Mark. Or, at

. least, that’s the ofﬁcial synopsis. In reality, the

ﬁlm is an inexplicable cocktail of promptly
discarded narratives —— breast cancer, a drug
dealer named Chris—R — interminable sex
scenes and putrid lines that are delivered,
more often than not, by the dazed, vaguely
draconian director himself: “I did not hit her!
I did not! [Pause.] Oh, hi Mark!.”

Among the ﬁlm’s near inﬁnite ﬂaws, I give
you a few highlights: There is no single room

of any special relevance; scenes are often
punctuated by an establishing shot of a San I

Francisco landmark — sometimes at a dif-

  Tybout: Camp fans, visit ‘The Room’ :

ferent time of day —— before returning to_ the
same bit of action; dialogue is randomly and
unnecessarily overdubbed, giving the ﬁlm a

' surreal distance; Wiseau’s character gives a

strained, mutilated chuckle after nearly every
line, regardless of what he’s saying; characters
often fall down without explanation; the ﬁlm
schizophrenically employs both an HD and a

_ 35 mm camera because Wiseau was ‘.‘conﬁJsed

about these two formats;” a man viewers don’t
meet until about 20 minutes before the end of
the movie lectures characters as if he’s been

"there all along; even the DVD’s “Behind the

Scenes” feature is a bungled misinterpreta-
tion of the term, composed almost entirely of
eventless shots of the crew setting up.

In a just world, “The Room” would have
been smitten from human memory before it

‘ could do any lasting damage. But through— '

out the past several years, screeningshave
increased exponentially in cities around the

“Eat Pray Love”

Directed by: Ryan Murphy

Starring: Julia Roberts, James Franco
Columbia Pictures

Grade: B

To authors, a movie deal is a godsend, but to
fans, it can be.a mixed blessing.

Movies often inevitably gloss over those
subtleties we ﬁnd most meaningful in a book
and instead extract those overlying themes we
felt were most obvious. “Eat Pray Love” makes
a solid effort to go into more depth than ajulia
Roberts international road trip and has limited
success. ,

When judging a ‘movie on the basis that it
was written to epitomize a‘ book —— “Eat Pray
Love” was originally a memoir by novelist and
sometimes journalist Elizabeth Gilbert — it’s
the overarching ideas, craftily placed where the
audience member will most likely appreciate
them, that matter most.

Gilbert’s book is popular, not only for its
compelling narrative of a woman who took a
leave of absence to travel and ﬁnd herself, but
also for its philosophical ponderings.

The question is, does the movie retain these ‘

latter complexities, or do es it simply attempt to
tell the story? I ’ .

First off, the plot of the movie does not disap-
point. Director and screenwriter Ryan Murphy
and screenwriterjennifer Salt were successful in
capturingthe basic story with afewunobtrusive‘
additions and subtractions. ‘

This wasn’t an easy task l— Gilbert had
segmented the book into three sections, each
containing 36 vignettes. That adds up to 108
brief episodes, rather than a seamless continu-
ing plot. I

But the ﬁlm manages to retain the most poi- '

gnant and important moments that capture
the essence of the book — for example, when
Elizabeth and her Brazilian love interest, Felipe,
go swimming, and he quite charmingly explains
his physical attraction to her.

However, moments when Gilbert notices a

' . particular fountain in Italy or muses about an

Indian boy in ill—ﬁtting clothing are lost due to
the time constraints of cinema.

Granted, Murphy does occasionally retain
the little details about culture and history that,
in the book, aid the reader in understanding
Gilbert, such as an e—mail to her ex—boyfriend
David about the Augusteum in Rome. In the
book, however, these instances often serve as
windows into Gilbert’s complex psychology,
whereas the diminished movie version is det-
rimental to her character. 0

The Elizabeth of the movie is oversimpliﬁed.
Julia Roberts, without a doubt, nails Gilbert’s
self-proclaimed friendliness and sparkle, but
we’d expect no less from awoman who made a
prostitute endearing.

Unfortunately, the dialogue seems like it
was edited to suit a conservative, middle—aged
female demographic.

In fact, it probably was. As close to the be-
ginning as page eight of her book, Gilbert says
things like, “For instance, perhaps I could re-
main totally celibate except for keeping a pair
ofhandsome 25-year-old Italiantwinbrothers
as lovers.” But this kind of suggestive humor,
alongwith Gilbert’s tendency toward the occa-
sional selfldeprecating quip, is limited. Without
the levity to counterbalance her dramatics,
Elizabeth in the movie seems to take herself

' too seriously.

Although the main character is simpli-
ﬁed, some of the other characters are played
wonderfully, particularly the gruff but patient
Richard from Texas (Richardjenkins) and the
undeniably charming and affectionate Felipe
(Javier Bardem). :

Sadly, even Felipe isn’t done ﬁill justice —— 0

another aspect the movie fails to nail is the depth
and intricacy ofhis relationship with Elizabeth.
With the ﬁckle emotions and constant extremes
of the couple in the movie, one would think that
Elizabeth’s story was a never-ending cycle of
reverting to old habits of throwing herselfinto
another poor relationship. _

. Whereas the ﬁlm redeems itself a little
with its provocative questions and Elizabeth’s
somewhat light soul searching, “Eat Pray Love”

doesn’t speak to the very obvious tenderness I

and supportiveness of Elizabeth and Felipe’s
connection in the book.

Movies are rarely able to epitomize the
whole of a written work, but the success of an
adaptation can be based offwhether those in-
volved managed to capture the main ideas. “Eat
Pray Love” does afair job of graspingthe gist of

' the story, though some important components

seem to be neglected. A

‘Room’ wins ‘worst movie’ title

Room 4 6

everyone from Paul Rudd to Patton Oswalt.
I discovered it in the August issue of Harper’s
Magazine. A

Far from letting its dubious reception de-
ter him, Wiseau attempted to justify the ﬁlm
by pulling a branding 180: “The Room,” he
decided, was meant to be funny all along.

This conﬂict of intent manifests itself
most arrestingly in the ﬁlm’s 30-second
teaser, which I encourage all of you to watch
on IMDb. In it, two dueling narrators — a
somber man who promises us the ﬁlm has

“the passion of Tennessee Williams” and
another, much cheerier man who assures us
it’s a “quirky new black comedy” — vie for
control of the ﬁlm’s genre, though the dark
orchestral score, which Wiseau neglected to
eliminate, tips the scales in favor of the for-
mer. Intact, however, are the ﬁlm’s delusions
of grandeur — “the best movie of the year!”
champions the comedic narrator.

This repositioning is precisely “Room”—
esque. It is an ambitious but absurd move

that only adds to the sublime feeling of failure

engendered when the credits roll.

Last year I celebrated “Troll 2,” anothef’
contender in the heated battle for “worst
movieever.”

This year, I’ll have to overturn that-en-
dorsement. .

Unlike “Troll 2,” “The Room” is bad in
an avant—garde way, and new incompeteng,
cies bob to the surface after each viewing. As
Tommy Wiseau said in a partly overdubbed
interview on the DVD, “You may not like it,
but you will learn something.”

Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s soccer team started the
season with a scoring record and a career
ﬁrst, despite early games ﬁlled withmissed
scoring opportunities.

, Head coach Sue—Moy Chin said the Pan—_ .
,;,thers haven’t playedtheir best soccer yet, but - -

she’s pleased with the team’s effort.

’ “We’re still working things out in the mid-
ﬁeld and getting our backline sorted out as
well,” Chin said. f‘But at the same time, we’re
sitting at 2-2, and we have the chance to get
some things sorted out this weekend when

I “we go on our ﬁrst road trip.”

Chin attributes the early, season difﬁculties

Ten games
not to miss
this fall

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Last week, when we got a brief reprieve from
the surnrner’s heat, and I got awhiffof the cool,
crisp air, I immediately thought of one thing:
football season. V

Yes, that’s right. It’s ﬁnally college football
season, and Pitt looks like it could have a big
year. And with abigyear come several big games,
but the football team isn’t the only team that has
some big games this fall.

So forthisweek’s Top 10, I giveyou the games
you’d be a fool to miss this fall..

10. _Football at Connecticut Nov. 11j(7:3o
p.m.) —‘ This has the potential to be a make-or-
break game for the Panthers. Pitt was picked,
almost unanimously, to win the Big East this
year in the annual coaches’ poll, but two other
teams each got a ﬁrst place vote. It’s no surprise
that West Virginia received a ﬁrst place vote,
but_ Connecticut did, too. When I ﬁrst saw that,
I had to_double check tl1at I didn’t read “Cincin-

nati”wrong. So apparently, Connecticutwill be_

good this year.

9. Cross Cotmtry — Duquesne Duals Sept.
4 (9 am. at Schenley Park Oval) —— The cross
country team will face off against Duquesne
this Saturday. .

“Because of the proximity of our two schools,
it has always been a natural rivalry,” head coach
Alonzo Webb said. “Plus a lot of the athletes on
both teams have competed against each other
in high school since most are from the state of
Pennsylvania.”

8. Volleyball vs. Cincimiati Nov. 7 (2 p.m.
Fitzgerald Field House) —— Cincinnatiwas picked
towinthe Big Eastthis year, with14 of 15 possible
ﬁrst place votes. This gamewillbe a nice test for

'* the Panthers as they gear up to host the Big East

Championship later that month.

7. Women’s Soccer vs. Marquette Sept. I

27 (1 p.m. Founders Field)'—— Marquette was
selected to ﬁnish ﬁrst in the American Division
ofthe BigEast, sothiswillbeanimportant game.
It comes early in the conference schedule and

Jovenitti > 9

jovenitti 4 8

will be a good challenge for the de-
fense and goalkeeper Morie Kephart,
who led the nation last year in save
percentage.

6. Volleyball vs. Purdue Sept. 3
(7 p.m. at Fitzgerald Field House) -—
This is Pitt’s ﬁrst home match, and it
is a part of the Pitt Invitational, which
will see the Panthers play Lipscomb

and Tulane the next day. But head ‘

coach Toby Rens said that Purdue
will be one of the biggest games of
the year.

“Purdue has a great volleyball
program, and it should be a battle,”
Rens said. “People willbe impressed
with the way (our) team competes
and represents Pitt.”

5. Football@Utah Sept.2 (8:30
p.m.) — Utah is ranked No. 24 in the
USA Today/Coaches poll, whereas
Pitt is No. 15. This is the ﬁrst time
since 1976 — when they kicked off

the year at Notre Dame — that the -

Panthers, while ranked in the Top
25, have opened the season against
anotherTop-25 team. And incase you
don’t know what happened in 1976,

the names Tony Dorsett and Heis-
man should ring a bell. Oh yeah, Pitt
went undefeated and won a national
championship that year, too..

4. Men’s Soccervs. Connecticut
Oct. 30 (1 p.m. at North Allegheny
High School) —- This is the ﬁnal game
of the year for the Panthers, and it will
be played at North Allegheny rather
than the much smaller Founders Field
in Harmarville.

“We play a bunch of ranked
teams,” head coach Joe Luxbacher
said. “But UConn is picked to win the
Big East.”

3. Volleyball — Big Easttouma-
ment Nov. 19-21 (Fitzgerald Field
House) + The Big East tournament
comes to Pitt this year, and the Pan-
thers will host the top eight teams
for a single-elimination tourna-
ment. Last year at Louisville, the No.
3-seeded Panthers were upset by No.
6—seeded South Florida in four sets.
This year, the Panthers are picked to
ﬁnish ﬁfth.

2. Football vs. West Virginia
Nov. 26 — The 103rd installment
of the Backyard Brawl takes place at

Heinz Field this year, and it could have
signiﬁcant championship implica-
tions, both within the conference and
nationally. The West Virginia game is
always a bitter battle, and last year the
Panthers lost by two points thanks
to a last—second West Virginia ﬁeld
goal. And for the second yearinarow,
Heinz Field could host the de facto Big
East championship game. But West
Virginia comes to town every other
year, which is why it is not the No. 1
game of the year.

1. Football vs. Miami Sept. 23
—— In 2oo5, Miami leftthe BigEastto
jointhe ACC—lookhowthatworked
out for them. The Hurricanes only

. made it to three bowl games in their
, L ﬁve years with the.ACC, going 1-2 in.

those mediocre bowls. But it looks
like this year the U is back in con-
tention, as they are ranked No. 13 in
the USA Today poll. This is the ﬁrst
time Pitt has played Miami since the
Hurricanes said “sayonara” to the Big
East. Even ESPN knows how big of a
game this is since it is on Thursda
night primetime. -

So go get your Pitt pride onfor
all of the University’s teams. Happy
cheering. I

Martin.

Liz Sullivan connected on a free
kick from 40 yards out in the 67“‘
minute, when the ball bounced over
the head of Kephart and into the
net.

Pitt had only two shots on goal,
with scoring opportunities in the
fourth and 60”‘ minutes. In the
fourth minute, Ohio State goal-
keeper Rachel Middleman made a
shoulder—high save to keep Ashley
Cuba’s shot from going in.

In the 60”‘ minute, Carroll nar-
rowly missed a goal off a header.

The Buckeyes out—shot the Pan-

up. “We were trying to match the
emotion from Friday, and we had
to battle the heat.”

DelleFemine scored her ﬁrst

V

career goal in the 16"‘ minute of
a pass from Ruhe at the top of the
box. She scored her second goal in
the 87”‘ minute, once again assisted
by Ruhe.

Laura Berbert scored the other
Panther goal off a penalty kick in
the 71“ minute.

Pitt was awarded the penalty

' kick after Alexandrajaffe was held

up in the box.

Ruhe ﬁnished the game with two
assists. Carroll and Jaffe each had
one assist.

Despite the win, Chin said she
saw room for improvement.

“We could have been more com-
posed on the ball,” she said. “But
overall, I "think they worked hard
and well together. Katie Ruhe did‘ a‘
good job supplying the ball.”

The Panthers had 21 shots to
Oakland’s three, including an 8-2
shots-on-goal advantage.

Kephart ﬁnished with two saves
for the Panthers, while Oakland
goalkeeper Shannon Coley had
ﬁve. y

“We had a good effort after that
tough Friday match,” Chin said.
“The girls responded.” .
