SALUTE: BOBGILFILLAN Ill

Bob Gilﬁllan III (B.S., 1961) is a man with technical
background and a flair for administration. This com- .
bination has been a tremendous asset for Bob in his
responsibilities as senior engineering assistant.

In his presentposition, he supervises the Bell of Penn-
sylvania’s dial operations center at Jenkintown. Bob and
his staff of 18 are responsible for giving customers in the
area the best possible dial service." Besides the operational
functions of this job, he must oversee the efficient engineer- V
ing and plant maintenance of central oliice equipment."

Bob came to his present position after a successful
training period where he demonstrated his ability. to attain
groupcooperation in the completionof a project. F unc-
tioning as a group is important to the progress of telephone
communications, and Bob’s talents mark him for "bigger
and better assignments. . . . . ' .

Bob Cilﬁllan, like many young engineers,‘ is impatient "
to make things happen for his company and himself. There
arefew places where such restlessness is more welcomed .. F
or rewarded than in the fast-growing telephone business.
