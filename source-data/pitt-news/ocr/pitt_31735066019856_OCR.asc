MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) ~— A
French warship spotted three
mines and Iranian speedboats
which had raided two tankers
Tuesday, the day after battles in
the southern Persian Gulf in
which Iran fired missiles from
shore at U.S. Navy vessels.

A marine executive said the
gulf appeared ”ghostly" from
lack of shipping. He and others
said commercial vessels were
avoiding the waterway, where
Iran and Iraq have been at war
since September of 1980 and the
U.S. Navy sank or damaged six

Iranian vessels Monday.

They also said the United States
had suspended escorts of Kuwai-
ti oil tankers temporarily, but
Defense Department spokesman
Dan Howard denied it. The Unit-
ed States gave American flags and
registration to I I Kuwaiti tankers
last year and the Navy escorted
them through the gulf.

Iran claimed its speedboats in
the southern gulf sank an ”Ameri-
can naval logistical ship,” killing
its crew, an hour after Navy ships
destroyed two Iranian oil plat-
forms Monday.

The official Islamic Republic
News Agency headlined the dis-
patch ”Yankees Go Down‘To

Watery Grave As Revolutionary
Guards Sink U.S. Ship,” but it
contained no details.

At the Defense Department in
Washington, Howard said of the
claim: ”No report has reached us
from our forces in the Gulf of any
hostile acts [against them] today.”

After the confrontation Mon-
day, the Pentagon said there were
no confirmed U.S. casualties, but
a search was being conducted for
a missing AH-I helicopter with
two crewmen aboard. Iran
claimed to have shot it down.

At the United Nations in New
York, Iran lodged a formal com-
plaint Tuesday about attacks by
the ”war—monger” United States.

VOLUME ElGHTY—TWO, ISSUE ONE HUNDRED TEN

Gulf shipping decreases in wake of U.S., Iran exchange

Washington responded that its
actions have been ”necessary
and proportionate.”

IRNA also said an American at-
tack Monday on the patrol boat
Joshan killed 15 crew members
and injured 29.

In Monday's operations, U.S.
Navy forces destroyed two off-
shore Iranian oil platforms in the
southern Gulf, then sank the Jo-
shan, disabled two frigates and
sank or damaged three attack
boats.

Iran attacked neutral commer-
cial ships after the raid on the
platform, which were in retalia-
tion for a mine that damaged the

_Paul A. Volcker, distinguished
economist and former chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board, has
been chosen to deliver the com-
mencement address for the
University of Pittsburgh on April
30 in the Civic Arena.

"Volcker has spent a large por-
tion of his distinguished career in
public service,” according to Pitt

Secretary of the Board of Trustees _

John Quatroche, and he will
receive an honorary Doctor of
Public Service degree from Pitt
during the commencement
service.

Volcker was chosen by Pitt's
Special Committee for Com-
mencement and Honors Convo-
cation Speakers and Honorees,
which has the responsibility of es-
tablishing a list of qualified peo-
ple whom the Chancellor might
invite to speak at ‘these
ceremonies. .

According to criteria forthe

selection of the speakers, candi-
dates must have attained emi-
nence in their chosen fields of
scholarship or endeavor.

Potential speakers must have
contributed to the further de-
velopment of scholarship through
research or publications and/or
leadership involvement in recog-
nized professional associations or
organizations.

The candidates must also have
been responsible for innovation
in the discovery or dissemination
of knowledge and have a distin-
guished record of valuable pub-
lic service and community
leadership.

Quatroche said that Volcker
”may put some stress on public
service in his commencement ad-
dress for graduation this year.”

Volcker is currently chairman
of James D. Wolfensohn, Inc. and
a professor of international eco-

nomic policy at Princeton

University. ‘
Volcker was initially appointed
Chairman of the Board of Feder-

' Commencement speaker chosen

al Reserve System by President
Jimmy Carter in 1979. He was
then reappointed in 1983 by
President Reagan and kept the
position until August of 1987.

Volcker then agreed to serve as
chairman of a privately spon-
sored Commission on the Public
Service, which studies problems
arising in attracting, motivating
and retaining quality government
employees.

Throughout his career, Volcker
has worked in the federal govern-
ment for nearly 30 years, serving
under five presidents.

Volcker has served in various
positions at the treasury, the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank of New York
and the Chase Manhattan Bank.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, April 20, 1988

Pa. may get new execution style: lethal injection

HARRISBURG — A Senate
committee on Tuesday approved
a bill that would make death by
lethal injection the state's new
form of capital punishment,
replacing the present method of
electrocution where the person is
”fried,” the bill's sponsor said.

The Senate Judiciary Commit-
tee sent the bill to the Senate floor

V on a 7-1 vote. At least one sen-

ator said he was voting in favor
of the bill solely to bring it before
the full chamber for discussion.

Judiciary Chairman Stewart
Greenleaf, R-Montgomery and
sponsor of the bill, said death by
injection would be a more hu-
mane way for death row inmates
to die.

”|t’s time for us to dismantle

the electric chair,” Greenleaf.

said.

’’I think that if there is a less
painful way of executing a per-
son, it's our responsibility to
adopt that,” he added after the
meeting.

A proponent of capital punish-
ment, Greenleaf said he had
studied other states that are using
death by lethal injection and that

it appeared to be a less painful
method of capital punishment
than electrocution.

”Electrocution is a nice term,”
he said. ”Really, the person is
fried.”

Dr. John DiGregorio, professor
of pharmacology and medicine
and director of the division of tox-
icology at Hahnemann Universi-
ty in Philadelphia, agreed lethal
injection would be less painful
than electric shock.

’’Basically, the person would
fall asleep and not feel any pain
at all,” he said. '

DiGregorio said he could not
say what drugs the state would
use in the injection, but guessed
a type of depressant would be
given in a verylhigh dosage.

gather student support for the
”visibility exercise,” said student
volunteer Sandy Robinson.

”Our goal is to draw as much
attention to Dukakis as possible.
I expected a lot of apathy, but
about 50 people volunteered,”
said Robinson, who was the lo-
cal campaign manager for Gary
Hart in 1984.

Robinson said that Dukakis is
the only democratic candidate
who has a ”legitimate chance to
the win the White House.”

”We feel that he's a really in-
telligent and honest candidate,”
she said.

Campaign worker Robert Mor-
row is helping to organize sup-
port for Dukakis at Pitt. ’’I drove
all the way from Alabama just for
the Pennsylvania primary be-
cause it’s that crucial,” he said.

”This is really the test. If he can
win the Pennsylvania and New
York primaries, he'll be solid,”
Robinson said.

be held on April 26.

day earlier.

groups,” Morrow said. ’’I think
Dukakis is probably the candi-
date of choice on the Pitt
campus.”

Students at Carnegie Mellon
University also participated in
yesterday's campaign activities.

Some of the reasons the cam-
paign workers gave for support-
ing Dukakis included his 10 years
of experience as governor of Mas-
sachusetts, the 2.9 percent unem-
ployment rate in that state, his
”steady” financial backing and
his ”positive” campaign.

”Jesse Jackson is running a
good positive campaign, too. In
the end, all of the candidates are
really going to be able to work
together,” Robinson said.

’’In a way, it seems like a repeat
of 1960,” said Robinson. ”We
have a conservative, incumbent
vice—president running against a
young candidate from Mas-
sachusetts during what is suppos-
edly a time of prosperity. But
there is beginning to be unrest.”

Volunteers helped the cam-
paign by answering calls and
responding to callers’ questions
at the phone banks and by dis-
tributing leaflets, campaign but-
tons and bumper stickers.

Reagan also said he was not
surprised by Iran's decision to
fight back Monday after U.S.
forces destroyed two Iranian oil
platforms in retaliation for the
mining that damaged a Navy ship
last week.

Persian Gulf causes
rise in gold futures

By David Dishneau

Associated Press Writer

Gold futures prices rose
Monday on expectations that
an outbreak of fighting in the
Persian Gulf could drive oil
prices and inflation higher, but
analysts were skeptical about
the chances for a sustained
rally.

On other markets, energy fu-
tures advanced; most livestock
and meat futures declined;
grains and soybeans were
mixed; and stock-index futures
rose.

Gold for June delivery set-
tled above $460 a troy ounce
on the Commodity Exchange
in New York for the first time
this month. But the settlement
price of $461 .70 was well be-
low the day's high of $464, an
11-week high.

Silver and platinum also
jumped in early trading, but an
afternoon selloff pushed their
settlement prices below Fri-
day’s final prices.

Gold settled $3.20 to $3.80
higher, with the contract for
delivery in June at $461.70 a
troy ounce; silver was 2.7
cents to 3.5 cents lower, with
May at $6.44 a troy ounce.

Crude-oil futures also fell

.back on the New York Mer-

cantile Exchange after a morn-
ing rally that pushed the
contract for May delivery to
$18.92, just short of the im-
portant $19-a—barrel level.

West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled 15 cents to 26
cents higher, with contracts for
May delivery at $18.52 a bar-

Bush uses mail—outs to
stimulate voter turnout

(AP) — Though Vice President
George Bush seems invincible in
Pennsylvania's April 26 primary,
his campaign is not taking his ex-
pected victory for granted.

Bush's campaign committee is

I sending out a mass mailing to

300,000 Republicans who regu-
larly vote, reminding them of the
importance of coming out next
week, The Morning Call in Allen-
town reported Tuesday.

His campaign chairman,
Republican National Committee-
woman Elsie Hillman, said many
non—Bush delegates remain on
the Pennsylvania ballot and some
could end up being elected to the
national convention -in New
Orleans.

The problem, she said, is that
unlike the Democrats, who allow
delegate candidates to declare
their allegiance on the ballot, the
Republican ballot does not show
which presidential hopeful the
delegate candidate supports.
Delegates will be key to the de-
velopment of the Republican
platform in New Orleans, she
added.

”You don't want to send
George Bush to a convention that
does not have delegates that are
not totally in tune to what he has
in mind for the‘ platform,”
Hillman said, adding that she has
been told Robertson delegates
are still campaigning hard in
several regions of the state.

Robertson delegates occupy
the top ballot position in 12 of the
23 congressional districts across
the state, The Philadelphia Inquir-
er reported Tuesday.

Bush’s campaign executive
director in Pennsylvania, John
Denny, told the Inquirer that
Robertson could win 10 to 12
delegates out of the 78 at stake.
The state committee has already
picked 18.

’’It’s going to be a screwy bal-
lot,” Hillman said, noting that
there are sometimes dozens of
candidates seeking election as
delegates in a congressional dis-
trict. ”|t behooves us just to do
the best job we can to make the
voters aware that [...] it is impor-
tant to vote for Bush delegates.”

Hillman says it is ”absolutely
silly, ridiculous,” not to list the
delegates preference on the bal-
lot. ”Everybody who runs is com-

One of Robertson's national
goals was to have his backers be-

party organizations, but that effort
has not borne fruit in Pennsylva-

Hamadi is guilty of kidnappings

By Terrence Petty
Associated Press Writer

DUESSELDORF, West Ger-
many — A court convicted Ab-
bas Hamadi on Tuesday of
abducting two West Germans
as ransom for his brother, Mo-
hammed, who is accused of
hijacking a TWA jetliner.

Abbas Hamadi, 29, was sen-
tenced to 13 years in prison af-
ter being found guilty on all
charges of kidnapping, coer-
cion and possession of ex-
plosives.

’’It is totally reprehensible to
rob two innocent people of

their freedom and make them
fear for their lives,” Chief
Judge Arend said in explaining
the sentence he and his four
colleagues meted out to
Hamadi.

The 13-year term was 18
months longer than the prose-
cution requested. The maxi-
mum allowed was 15 years.

Hamadi slumped into his
chair after hearing the verdict
and remained silent. More
than 100 spectators, most of
them reporters, were in the
room.

Mohammed Hamadi was ar-
rested at Frankfurt airport Jan.
13, 1987, and Abbas 13 days

later, both with explosives in
their possession. Mohammed
Hamadi is accused in thelune
1985 hijacking of a TWA jet-
liner to Beirut in which a U.S.
Navy diver was killed and 39
Americans were held hostage
for 17 days.

Both Hamadis were living in
West Germany at the time of
their arrests. After Mohammed
Hamadi was jailed, but while
his brother was free, two West
Germans were kidnapped in
Beirut: Rudolf Cordes on Jan.
17 and Alfred Schmidt on Jan.
20.

Schmidt was released in

September, but Cordes re-
mains a hostage.

Arend said the evidence
proved Abbas Hamadi was
among radical Shiite Moslems
who plotted the kidnappings
to try to block Mohammed
Hamadi’s extradition to the
United States. West Germany
has refused extradition and as-
signed Mohammed Hamadi’s
case to juvenile court for trial.

In Washington, deputy State
Department spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley said: ”We com-
mend today's action by the
West German court, which
sends a clear signal to ter-
rorists.” J

Defense lawyer Eckart Hild
said he would appeal and told
reporters, ‘'1 do not find this
judgment at all convincing.”
Abbas Hamadi denied in-
volvement in the kidnappings
but admitted storing explo-
sives near his home in
Saarland state for his younger
brother. J ' '

The chief judge 1‘ said in
court, ”After the arrest ‘of Mo-
hammed Hamadi, the group
in Beirut considered whether
to attack the West German
Embassy in Lebanon, hijack a
German airliner or kidnap a
German citizen,” and decided
on kidnapping.

An older Hamadi brother,
Abdul-Hadi, also was among
the plotters, Arend said.

, The athletic dept.

should be consistent

Pitt Athletic Director Dr. Edward E. Bozik doesn't want Mike
Gottfried to feel the pressure of insatiable fans and boosters,
so he gave his football coach a long-term, multi-year contract
Monday to make him feel a little more secure.

Gottfried, who has gone 13-9-1 in his first two seasons, in-
cluding a trip to the Bluebonnet Bowl last year, will receive
a bonus if the graduation rate of his players is 79 percent or
higher. This type of provision is not found in most coaching
contracts.

And for good reason. Our thinking was that Gottfried was
hired to win football games, not produce academic scholars.
Obviously, the operative word here is bonus. We doubt Gott-
fried will severely change his recruiting style to make drastic
improvement on his graduation rate. He'll still go for the mar-
ginal student with blazing speed.

Gottfried must be commended for his ability to bargain for
a better contract with the athletic department.

However, what is hard to fathom is the message Bozik is send-
ing to Pitt football followers and Gottfried.

Fans want wins. Need we remind Bozik that this football stuff
is big business, after all? At least his actions in the past have
made that point clear. Bozik grabbed the quick cash from the
Bluebonnet Bowl then blacked out home basketball games be-
cause he was worried Pitt's pocketbook would grow thin.

Bozik should know better than to give us that rhetoric about
higher education. The Golden Panthers want wins, wins and

' more wins. So do the fans. They don't care about graduation

rates. All they care to see is that the players are, at the least,
eligible.

Another question arises: Is Gottfried going to become stag-
nant now? The possibility does exist. Many people thrive un-
der pressure. Others become lazy because of the serenity of
their settings. It looks as if a 5-5-1 season won't get Gottfried
fired. Or even two straight 5-5-1 seasons.

Bozik also announced plans to build a multipurpose athlet-
ic structure that can be converted into an indoor football prac-
tice field. The facility, which will be built on Robinson Street
near Trees Hall, will be part of a seven-story garage operated
in conjunction with Presbyterian University Hospital. The ath-
letic department pledged to raise $2.5 million for the facility
with the other $1.5 million coming from the university.

Gottfried has made adamant demands for an indoor practice
facility since he arrived here in December of 1985. He want-
ed it so badly that he threw in $50,000 himself. We're sure
the indoor facility was a bargaining ploy for Gottfried, who
wants Pitt's facilities to be on par with some of the finest foot-
ball institutions in the country.

So, Bozik is giving Gottfried the incentive to improve the
team's graduation rate, while at the same time, giving him an
added recruiting tool when going after high school All—America
players.

Doesn't that seem just a little bit contradictory? Bozik would
do well to remember this is the University of Pittsburgh, not
Brigham Young, Notre Dame, Duke or Penn State, four schools
which combine academic and athletic excellence. Joe Pater-
no doesn't need monetary incentives to get his players to gradu-
ate. Bozik should quit trying to achieve utopia in intercollegiate
athletics at Pitt —- it's never been done here before and it never
will be.

Bozik should either moderate his stance on academic superi-
ority in this million-dollar business called collegiate football,
or request that Pitt drop to Division III. it's that simple.

Current drug policy has flaws

About two weeks ago, I
watched an ABC-TV News spe-

A cial on drugs hosted by Peter Jen-

nings. Coming on the heels of a
fellow columnist’s appeal to
legalize marijuana (and subse-
quent pro and can mail), I think
this issue must be properly ad-
dressed.

My instincts tell me that drugs
shouldn't be legalized, but since
the U.S. hasn't been able to make
a significant dent in the drug
problem since Nancy Reagan
adopted drugs as her pet peeve,
it would seem more sensible to
legalize them. Why?

Simple. Although I don't con-
done drugs (the illegal ones), it
would be much better for our
country if they were legalized.
One need only look at the days
of prohibition to see the implica-
tions inherent with illegal drugs.
The United States faces the same
exact situation now that it did
when the Volstead Act was oper-
ating, so it's a wonder that the
people in government haven't
come to their senses and done
something worthwhile about the
problem.

There are only two choices for
the government: legalize and
regulate drugs or use military
force against the drug industry.
Allow me to explain.

Legalizing drugs would be far
more beneficial to the country
than continuing to suppress
them. First, and most important,
legalizing drugs would take them
out of the hands of organized

Get that

I am writing because I am ab-
solutely sick and tired of your
paper's perspective section and

remarks that fill it.

It seems every day, it's the
same old thing: Reagan this, Rea-
gan that. It appears that The Pitt
News perspective staff has some-
thing against the Reagan adminis-
tration, _and they make it known
in every damn issue of the paper,
especially that grinning goon

crime.

This alone would reduce the
amount of death and destruction
associated with drugs. If the
government were in charge of
making and selling drugs, or-

ganized crime would no longer

kill drug-enforcement agents,
policemen or private citizens
who were out to do something
about keeping drugs out of their
communities.

Second, there would be far less
drug-related crime committed be-
cause government-manufactured
drugs would be less costly and
easier to obtain.

Third, government-
manufactured drugs would be
safer to use, eliminating ”bad
drugs” from the streets.

Fourth, the government could
use the money it reaped from
drug sales (and the money it
saved by not having to carry out
an anti—drug campaign) for some-
thing, anything else.

True, drugs have ruined many
peoples’ lives, but so has alcohol,
so that is not a viable reason for
maintaining the illegality of
drugs. Once drugs were in the
hands of the government, the
government would be able to
regulate usage vis-a-vis alcohol.
The government would then be
able to educate people about the

Anti-establishment shitheads,

the same repetitive anti, anti, anti
shit every single issue. Get out of
town, Thornton, and take that

with you.

~ hazards of drugs and to set up

groups similar to Alcoholics
Anonymous.

The alternative option would
necessitate’ the government
dedicating itself whole-heartedly
to smashing the drug trade. It
would have to quadruple the
amount of money it spends each
year and mobilize the military for
action. L

This would entail either
militarizing the borders with
armed patrols that let nothing into
the U.S. without a search, or else
outright attacking Central and
South American drug centers
with the Army.

Hand-in-hand with this would
be an increase in the police
forces across the nation and their
greater involvement in searching
out drug dealers. Also, more
penal institutions would have to
be built to house drug-related
criminals, as there is presently not
enough room to hold the crimi-
nals we already have in this
country.

Drugs are a tough topic to deal
with, mainly because the argu-
ment for legalizing them out-
weighs the argument for keeping
them suppressed. It seems repul-
sive to want to legalize some-
thing that has been seen to do
great damage to people, but not
legalizing drugs only perpetuates
the problem.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, April 20, I988

Q: Should a girl continue see-
ing a guy if he doesn’t give her
an orgasm?

A: Why not? I see security
guards day after day and they
don't. But I know you don't real-
ly mean just see the guy —— you
mean have sexual intimacy with
him. And my answer is yes —— if
you are interested in him, attract-
ed to him, like him, admire him,

‘love him. Because a man who

does not give you an orgasm now
will do so in the future if you take
the trouble to teach him how.

For a number of years now,
women have been told that they
should take charge of their own
orgasms and not expect men to
supply them. That may be a little
strong, and it may not give the
man enough importance in the
transaction, but even a hero can't
supply orgasms to a woman who
is resisting him.

When a woman does not have
an orgasm, it is usually because
she does not know how to or
won't let herself have one.

The way to find an orgasm is
not to try one man after another

but to find a man you really want
and learn how to have sex with
that particular man. Perhaps you
should give up on a man at some
point if he absolutely refuses to
consider your sexual needs, and
won't talk or listen to you on the
subject.

WESTHEIMER

Q: Why is it that men reach
their peaks at age 18 and wom-
en in their 305?

A: I suppose you mean their
peaks in sexual desire and perfor-
mance. You have heard some-
thing handed down from the
Kinsey Reports, which were very
surprising in their day and are
now being turned, in idle conver-
sation, into all kinds of mislead-
ing pseudo-facts.

When the Kinsey findings first
came out, a lot of guys who prid-
ed themselves on being mature
and able lovemakers were really
sore. The last thing they wanted
to hear was that mere boys were

better lovers than ”real men.” But
that was not what the information
meant. It seems to be statistically
true that most men in their late
teens are having more orgasms,
more ejaculations than later on in
life. That is the isolated fact that
you are talking about.
However, few males of 17 or
18 are as understanding or skilled
in making love as a good lover
who is somewhat older. In hu-
man sexuality, it is not the fre-
quency of erections or of
ejaculations that a good male
lover is measured by, but his
desirability plus his wanting to
please and knowing how to do it.
And most good male lovers are
really best with female partners
they have been with for a while.
I am not saying that there are no
accomplished lovers of 18. And
if you love an 18-year-old male,
then he is the male for you, and

he will get better as a lover with
time, no matter how good he
may be now.

If a woman is sexually more ac-
tive or a better lover at 35 than
at 20, it may be that she is going
through fewer growing-up
problems and can give herself to
each thing in her life more effec-
tively. Certainly this is to be
hoped for, that human beings get
better at living as the years pass.
I don't like to characterize any
age as the height of sexual pleas-
ure, because this pleasure is sub-
jective. Less sex at 70 may be
more pleasant than a lot of sex
was at 40. A better relationship
and calmer mind may make it 50.

friend has a longtime boyfriend,

Is sexual stimulation necessary for a relationship?

both of them. Ever since Igot
them together again he has been
interested in me, and in fact, we
are really attracted to each other.
We want to do something about
it, and I feel it’s time. I have had
this huge crush on him. He's real-
ly flirtatious and keeps leading
me on. What should I do?

A: Cut it out! What treachery

you are thinking about! First you ‘

get this girlfriend of yours back
with the guy, and then you want
to steal him from her.

But you are not so bad, only
thinking about it. You are tempt-
ed. Without temptation we have
nothing to resist. Resist! At your
age, all this intrigue is too deep,
and in the long run you will lose
a friend.

You are also too young to ”do
something about it” if that means
sex with anybody.

ed. The margin of error was five
percentage points.

”Mike is taking nothing for
granted,” said Dukakis’ Pennsyl-
vania spokesman Pat McCarthy.
He said a win could ”put Mike
over the psychological top” on
the road to the nomination.

A strong showing in New York
would helplackson in Pennsylva-
nia, but Dukakis is favored right

ble said.

Jackson, who won 16 percent
of the vote and 18 delegates in
the three—way 1984 presidential
primary, hopes to woo disaffect-
ed blue collar workers, particular-
ly in southwestern Pennsylvania,
where unemployment still runs
into double digits in some areas.
Statewide, he is hoping at least to
duplicate his record of attracting
15 percent to 20 percent of the

white vote.

”We’l| do better than in 1984,
exceed expectations and give
Dukakis a hell of a run for his
money," said Janice Fine, a na-
tional campaign aide.

Democratic Lt. Gov. Mark Sin-
gel, also neutral, disagreed.

Tornado rips through north Florida; four dead

MADISON, Fla. — A pre—dawn
tornado exploded through this
rural North Florida community
Tuesday, killing four people, des-
troying homes, throwing people
from their beds and leaving much
of a college campus in ruins.

Only rubble was left in some
neighborhoods after the tornado
cut a swath 12 miles long and at
least a half-mile wide about 4:30
a.m. Fifteen people were injured.
The mobile home of two of those
who were killed vanished from its
lot, leaving only foundation
blocks.

Families were thrown out of
bed while windows exploded
and their homes collapsed on top
of them.

’’I woke up with a roaring
sound [...] the windows blew out
on both sides of my bed, and the
roof came down on top of me,”
said Mitchell May, who was
pinned in the debris for three
hours. _

His neighbor, Diane Demsey,
said she and her husband, Pat,
had only moments to rush their

any additional action necessary
to protect themselves, U.S.—flag
vessels and U.S. lives."

Presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Adm. William
Crowe, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, had briefed Rea-
gan and the GOP leaders on the
gulf. He quoted Crowe as saying
that Iranian ships were essential-
ly staying in port.

Crowe also said there was no
evidence Iran had fired Silkworm
missiles, as had been reported
earlier.

Six Iranian ships were sunk or
crippled in a series of sea and air
battles Monday. No U.S. casual-
ties were reported, but a U.S. Ma-
rine attack helicopter failed to
return from a reconnaissance mis-
sion and was still listed as miss-
ing Tuesday.

Pentagon Spokesman Dan
Howard identified the missing
crewmen as Capt. Stephen C.
Leslie, 30, and Capt. Kenneth W.
Hill, 33, assigned to Squadron
HMLA-I67 based at the New
River, N.C., Marine Corps Air
Station.

Reagan said nine ships were
taking part in a search—and—rescue
mission for the helicopter. ”We
haven't found it yet. We're con-
tinuing to look,’’ Defense Secre-
tary Frank C. Carlucci told
reporters.

Iran's official Islamic Republic
News Agency claimed that Irani-
an warships had brought down a
U.S. helicopter and that a U.S.
ship was sunk Monday.

The spokesman said the Penta-
gon had no estimate of Iranian
casualties as a result of the fight-
ing, nor had U.S. ships picked up
any survivors.

Howard repeatedly and flatly
denied press reports that the Unit-
ed States was temporarily sus-
pending its escort operations for
reflagged Kuwaiti tankers until
the gulf calmed down again.

Reagan won support from the
Republican lawmakers for his
refusal to invoke the War Powers
Act, which the administration
claims is unconstitutional.
However, some Democrats dis-
sented.

”They were screaming ‘are we

”Then it was over as soon as it

The twister’s destructive path
started in front of a shopping
center and headed straight into
North Florida Junior College,
where it ”totaled the new library
and took the roof off the audito-
rium,” said Sheriff Joe Peavy. It
also demolished numerous
homes, blew the roof off a near-
by church, overturned cars and
knocked down trees.

It ripped apart the only obstetri-
cal clinic serving a four-county
area around Madison.

Florida Governor Bob Martinez
declared the four-county region a
disaster area.

Pirates’ policy not in step with other teams

Oh, those Pittsburgh Pirates.
They're in first place in the Na-

_tional League East with an 9-3

record. Barry Bonds has the sixth
best batting average in the Na-
tional League and was named NL
Player of the Week last week.

Yes, they're hot. They're on a
roll. And they seem to have taken
to misrepresenting facts in the
newspaper.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette fol-
lowed up an April 12 story in The
Pitt News concerning the Pirates’
college media policy, which
limits and sometimes disallows
coverage of the Bucs.

Rick Cerrone, vice-president of
public relations for the Pirates,
was quoted in the article as say-

ing, ”Most clubs do not recog-
nize college papers at all. The
Pirates are one of the few clubs
in baseball happy to recognize
the college media when space
permits. But there are times when
we cannot accomodate them,
like the home opener. We had
150 requests for opening night
credentials, and the press box
only seats 85.”

Fine. The press box was
packed, the stands were jammed.
Opening night was out of the
question for college media. But it
seems Mr. Cerrone is not familiar
with his own club’s policy-

As was made clear to The Pitt
News after we had requested

and clubhouse privileges are not
given to the college media. We
are issued two tickets and two
field passes, which can be used
for interviews 90 minutes prior to
the game. There are no post-
game interviews allowed. And
the allotted tickets are in the
stands.

So the issue of a crowded press
box is obviously not the problem.

Other ballclubs don't seem to
agree with Mr. Cerrone’s claims,
either.

Sophomore Chip Haines has been been a bright spot for the baseball team this season.

lations department for the
Cleveland Indians told The Pitt
News that ”we request only a let-
ter on letterhead from colleges
which have not been at games
before.”

Gharrity went on to say that
two tickets are given to college
papers or radio stations, and club-
house access is allowed both be-
fore and after the game.

She also said that press box
credentials are not issued to col-
lege media only because most of
these reporters do not file stories
directly from the game.

If this is also the Pirates’ reason-
ing, they could have made col-
leges aware of it in their
pre-season letter concerning col-

lege media, rather than forcing it
on us without reason.

Other ballclubs also vary from
the Pirates’ guidelines, including
the Baltimore Orioles. Although
officials contact the local colleges
only when room is available for
college media, the Orioles allow.

The Pitt bats came alive this
weekend at Villanova, but unfor-
tunately,' it wasn't enough to se-
cure a win. The Panthers dropped
four games this weekend to the
Wildcats, who are currently in
first place in the Big East

The Panthers’ record falls to '

4-17.

Pitt collected a total of 44 hits
during the four game series.

In the first game, Pitt lost 4-3.
Frank Merigliano pitched a com-
plete game, giving up two earned
runs, four hits, eight walks and
striking out four.

Right fielder Sean Alber, desig-
nated hitter Brian Lohman and
center fielder Bill Sherbondy
were all 1 for 2. .

In the second game, the Pan-
thers lost 18-12. Pitt outhit Vil-
lanova, 19 to 15. Second
baseman Chris Cioffi went 4 for
6, with a double and one RBI.
Third baseman Gregg Lamanti
went 3 for 4 with a double and
one RBI. Lohman, who belted
two home runs, went 3 for 6 with
five RBI. First baseman T.J.

Left fielder Matt Bianco was 3 for
6 with one RBI. Sherbondy was
2 for 4 with one RBI.

Ziener’s positive attitude helps wi

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

Senior volleyball player Krista
Ziener last week was named co-
winner of the Clutch Athlete of
the Year Award along with diver
Tricia Ney by the Laurel Chapter
of the Golden Panthers.

Ziener started her senior year
as a defensive specialist for the
Lady Panthers. Her primary role
on the team was receiving the op-

position’s serves, something
which is vital to any team’ suc-
cess but not likely to earn any in-
dividual recognition or notoriety.
To paint the scenario for Zien-
er’s clutch performance, it was
September and the Pitt was in the
midst of a 24-match winning
streak — and then fate stepped in.
All-Big East middle blocker
Nora Mulvihill went down with
a severe ankle injury. _
Theoutlook for thenremainder

of the season, while not bleak,
was not exactly one of unbridled
optimism for the Lady Panthers.
They had just lost the services of
a standout player and the tough-
est part of their schedule was
coming up. Ahead lay matches
with nationally—respected oppo-
nents such as Florida, Houston,
Ohio State and arch-rival Penn
State.

For two Pitt veteran players,
there was never a doubt as to

who would pick up the slack for
the injured Mulvihill.

”As far as Krista coming in and
playing inside, it was never a con-
cern. Being a setter, I never wor-
ried because Krista was someone
who never made many mistakes
and she would always do some-
thing smart with the ball,’’ said
‘Louise O’Shaughnessy:

Noreen Coughlin remembers
her feelings when Ziener was
promoted to a starting role. ”It

good enough team. We have
enough talent that we should be
able to turn it around. We need
a few wins under our belts to give
us confidence through the rest of
the season and to carry over to
next season.”

In the third game, the Panthers
lost 6-4. Rich Lowman pitched a
complete game, giving up six
runs, nine hits and three walks,
while striking out three.

Cioffi and Lohman were both
2-for-4.

In game four, Pitt lost 9-6.

Paul Ponzi started and went
seven and one-third innings. Pon-
zi gave up eight runs [six earned],
twelve hits, four walks and struck
out three. Relief pitcher Steve
Hoffmann gave up one run and
three hits while striking out three
in one and one-third innings.

Cioffi went 2-for-3 with one
double and two RBI. Left fielder
Bill Osborn was 2-for-3 with one
RBI. Shortstop Mike Claus went
2-for-4 with a double.

Head coach Bobby Lewis
said,”I think Villanova can win it
all. They are stronger than any-
one in our division. We hit the
ball well, we just couldn't get
them out.”

Composure on mound the key
of success for Panthers’ Ponzi

By Pam Schoeppner
For The Pitt News

Not many first—year baseball
players can pitch a complete
game in their initial collegiate
outing, especially when that
game is on television. It takes
a lot of poise and composure,
both of which Pitt sophomore
Paul Ponzi possesses.

In his very first start as a
member of the University of
Pittsburgh baseball team, Pon-
zi, a transfer from the State
University of New York at
Fredonia, pitched nine innings
in a close 1-0 loss to Central
Florida. The television
cameras did not rattle Ponzi a
bit.

”At first I was nervous,” said
Ponzi, a |eft—hander, ”but once
the game started I really did
not notice the cameras. I tend
to pitch better in big games.”

Ponzi was a standout at El-
mira Notre Dame High School
in Elmira, N.Y., where he
earned 12 letters -- four in
cross country, four in winter
track, one in spring track and
three in baseball. These
achievements earned him the
Athelete of the Year award his
senior class.

At Fredonia, a Division III
school, Ponzi was told he was
too small to play baseball, so
he ran indoor track instead,
winning a letter in his first
year. After one year, he trans-

ferred to Pitt, where he always
wanted to go to school, so that
he could pursue his favorite
sport. A walk-on to the base-
ball team, Ponzi’s original goal
last fall was just to make the
team. The coaches obviously
liked what they saw, and Pon-
zi quickly broke into the start-
ing rotation.

He had to make several ad-
justments as a pitcher from the
high school level to the col-
lege level, though.

’’In college there is a lot
more talent,” Ponzi said.
”Everyone was a top player in
high school.

’’In high school, I could just
throw the ball hard, but now

O’Leary adjusting to

new position, drives

to improve total play

By Pam Schoeppner
For The Pitt News

With the college baseball sea-
son in full swing, Panther base-
ball player T.J. O’Leary is
certainly taking his swings.

One of the bright spots for the
Panthers this season has been the
play of first baseman O’Leary. His
performance both offensively and
defensively has been outstanding.

O’Leary’s consistency at the
plate has enabled him to achieve
a .338 batting average, fourth on
the team through 21 games, and
to lead the team in RBI with 17.
After 12 games in Big East play,
the junior has a .340 average.

O’Leary’s most memorable
performance this season came
against St. Joseph's. In that game,
O’Leary was perfect at the plate,

4-for-4 with three RBI to lead the

Panthers to a 6-3 victory.

O’Leary constantly looks to im-
prove on his hitting, even though
he is having such a strong year at
the plate.

"I would like to start hitting bet-
ter,” said the Seton LaSalle High
School graduate. ”|’m hitting the
ball better and harder than last
year, but I'm not hitting the best
that I can.”

Not only is he an offensive
threat, but O’Leary is just as spar-
kling on the field. After playing
second base all last season and
the start of this season, O’Leary
was switched to first base after
the Villanova series, when catch-
er Jon Weaver was injured and
first baseman Jeff Hackett moved
behind the plate. The adjustment
was not a difficult one for
O’Leary.

’’It really has not been a
problem,” said O’Leary. ’’I had to
work a little on my positioning
and cut-offs at the beginning. I
really do not care where I play.
I just want to play and help the
team.”

With one year of eligibility re-
maining, O’Leary has set several
goals for the remainder of his col-

legiate career. He would like to
hit a few home runs before he ‘is
through playing. _
”l've only hit one, and that one
was windblown,”O'Leary said
smiling. ‘
Mostof all, O’Leary wants to

I‘ -start winning. Losing can be very

frustrating, but he remains op-
timistic.

’’If we could finish strong, we
would come into next season
with some confidence,” he said.

, ”We’re just not hitting the ball

when we need to. Our defense is
solid, but we need to start

Only one team we reached, the

lack of colleges in the Bronx and
the large number of daily

Obviously, these are not all the

Yet even those clubs not con-

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, April 20, W88

Photo by Michael Drozdzinski
Clutch Athlete of the Year co-winner Krista Ziener

Ziener

Continued from page 13

Houston that Ziener showed her-
self to be a force to be reckoned
with. The Lady Panthers won
games one and three while the
Lady Cougars took the second
and fourth games.

In the decisive fifth game, Pitt
rallied from a 11-14 deficit to win
a 17-15 thriller. Keyingthe victo-
ry for Pitt was Ziener, who out-
played a 6-foot-3-opponent
despite giving away seven inches
in height.

The game against Houston was
a turning point in Zeiner’s volley-
ball career at Pitt. ”[Pitt coach]
Shelton [Collier] showed so much
enthusiasm after the game and I
realized I had contributed to that
by playing an added extra role as
middle blocker. I stepped in and
did my job; and, I realized I could
do it again and again,” Ziener
recalled.

The Lady Panthers finished the

season with a 37-6 record,
qualifying for the NCAA Tourna-
ment for the third time in four
years. Ironically, the only year
they missed the tournament in
Krista’s four years was her sopho-
more year, when she sat out the
entire year with a shoulder inju-
ry and subsequent surgery.

The senior defensive-specia|ist-
turned-middIe—blocker has con-
tributed to the Lady Panther
cause off the court as well. Zien-
er’s winning attitude helped two
freshman teammates with their
transition to college life.

”For me, Krista is a person who
has always been there when you
needed her. She is a great role
model for the team,” said Big East
Freshman of the Year Jenelle
Lantagne.

Canadian Michele Adamson
recalls Ziener’s help during last
summer's preseason workouts,
”She was my roommate during

volleyball training camp and she .

helped with my transition from
Canada and for training camp."

Ziener has excelled in the
classroom as well. She recently
was selected to the Big East Aca-
demic All-Star Team, not surpris-
i-ng in light of her 3.8 QPA in her
physical education major last
term.

When Ziener entered the
University of Pittsburgh, her fu-
ture as a collegiate volleyball
player was not assured at all.
”Coming in as a walk on [from
North Allegheny High School], I
wondered how far I could go.
You come in with all these girls
you've been reading about in the
papers and you wonder,” she
said.

”As an athlete, especially in
volleyball, I wasn't given a lot of
benefits as far as height and
strength. I feel I've had to work
harder to prove myself as any ath-
lete to my team and myself,”
Ziener added.

Concerning the clutch athlete
award, Ziener commented, ’’I
was very excited about winning
the award. Tricia and I were the
first female athletes to win the
award and it was also the first
time they named co-winners.
Receiving the award with Tricia
was a real bonus because we are
real good friends.”

Collier, who has coached her
for the last four years, had some
definite opinions about Ziener.
”When I first was presented a bal-
lot for clutch athlete of the year,
it took about five seconds to de-
termine which of my players
deserved the nomination,” said
Collier.

Not only has Krista been a great
role model on our team, she has
had great success as a student
and has certainly come through
in a clutch situation for us,” he
added.

Collier feels that Ziener has left
a legacy for future Pitt volleyball
teams at Pitt. "In my eleven years
as a coach, I look at four or five
players as truly having an impact
on the development of my coach-
ing values and personal outlook.
I am proud to say that Krista has
been one of those. If I've done
half as much for her, I would be
happy,” reflected Collier.

Continued from page 14

I have to be more of a finesse
pitcher.”

Pitt has played 21 games so
far and Ponzi has pitched in
five — starting four of them.
He averages over six innings
pitched each outing, an indi-
cation of his composure on the
mound.

Ponzi’s fastball has been
clocked around 83 miles per
hour, but he feels his best
pitch is his change—up. Keep-
ing batters off guard is his
specialty.

”My goal is to pitch each
game well,” Ponzi said. ”I’m
going to start lifting over the
summer to get my fastball up.
Also, I'm going to play for the
Pittsburgh Federation League
to gain some additional ex-
perience.”

With Ponzi working hard to
improve his pitching game, it
looks like the Panthers have a
very bright future on the
mound.
