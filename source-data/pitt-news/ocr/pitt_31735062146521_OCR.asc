IT WAS A GOOD PARTY

Mrs. Bowman's Tea was as de-
lightful as last year. With so charm-
ing a hostess, it could not be other-.
wise. Talent among the Seniors
seems to increase with the years.
for their programs are -always a
pleasant surprise. Mrs. Bowman had
arranged a surprise, also. One of
her favorite vocalists, Mr, Ernest J.
Wright, accompanied by Mr. Edward
W, Koontz, among other selections,
gave Mrs. Bowman’s favorite, “Lit-
Mother 0’ Mine.”-

Margaret ,«McClenahan, '19, had
her undergraduate dancers there for
special numbers, which the girls all
enjoyed very much. Part of the pro-
gram was given under "some diffi-
culty, but thelast, very comfortably,
on the front veranda of the club
house. “Peg” was the"object of con-
gratulations for the training the
dancers showed. The older girls,
particularly, were pleased that the
girls on the campus were being
given this training.

Our honor guests were: Dean

By Minnie Z. Buckley, '15.
Helen Alpha" Burkart‘, '17, will be
married in the late summer" to
Robert H. Wettach, Col. ’14, Law ’17.
Both have been so prominent and

active in Alumni ‘aﬁairs that few re-

marks are necessary. Alpha, as an
undergraduate, was the first woman
member of the Student Advisory
Committee, and was the originator
of the present system of money dis-
tribution by that committee, by
wh. h almost all universal activities
on the campus, instead of only a
few, as had previously been the
case, are beneﬁted. After,gradua-
tion, she was connected with the
Playgrounds of Pittsburgh, and was
the ﬁrst woman supervisor with that
department. In 1921 she was elected
Grand President of the Zeta. Tau
Alpha Fraternity, ofwhich she was
a charter member of the Pittsburgh
chapter. Last year she was re-
elected to the, same position. In
1922 she entered Columbia Univer-
sityhand, at the end of the year, re-
ceived her Master’s degree. The
past year she has been a Fellow in
the Mental Hygiene Department of

L

the New York School of Social
Work, in Psychiatric Work. Next
Saturday she will receive her di-

ploma in Social‘ Psychiatric Work,
after one year’s work, although it
is listed as a l;wo—year course. Next
fall she will continue her work in
Nortli Carolina. “Bob” was a chap-
ter member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon
Fraternity Chapter at the rUniver-
sity. After graduation, and until he
left Pittsburgh, in ‘1921, he was a
member of the Council of the Gen-
eral Alumni Association. During the)
Wot-ldpWar he-was a. Marine aviator.l
He afterwards ‘practiced law in
Pittsburgh, until 1921, when he en-
tered Harvard Graduate. School,
from which he received his Master's
degree, in, 1922. For the past two
years he has been teaching in the
Law School of the University of
North Carolina. Bob and Alpha will
make their home in North Carolina.

about.90 per cent of you will remain

opinion, than Pittsburgh knows. It
is victory for the city’s industries,

“The ﬁrst duty of the State isthe

means of public health -measures in
the last sixty -years, the average life
of man has been prolonged twelve
years." This extraordinary result has
been brought about through re-
searches. by medical men, usually
connected with
schools, and has been possible only
through the co-operative labor’ of
many investigators.

000 people. The greatest asset Pitts-
burgh could ‘have, both for the pres-
ent and -for the future, would be a
great medical center, built around
the splendid medical ‘department of
the University of Pittsburgh, with a
view‘, to the reliefwof the afflictions
of: itscitizens, and" investigation of
the cause, and of the prevention of
disease. Medical education would be
greatly advanced, not’ only _,for the
undergraduate, but for those who
have graduated in medicine, -and who
devote to research the early period
following graduation. The_ commu-
nity would be enormouslybeneﬁtted
by such application of these years of
unselﬁsh labor in the hospitals in
the return it would later receive in
men highly trained along, special
lines. . 0' _

“The cost of education borne by
the American people. is greater than
any other expense supported by pub-
lic taxation. and, this burden is
borne willingly, with the expectation
that ﬁner citizenship will be the re-
sult, and with the hope that the
democratic form of government, to
maintain which the nation has of-
fered life and wealth in four great
wars ,shall be made ‘safe; -and de-
pendable in the future.

“Just a word’ now concerning the
service you are expected to give in
an effort to bring about good govern-
ment. The United States .was set-

tled by common people who were ,, 

dissatisﬁed with the conditions and
opportunities aﬁorded in countries
from which they came. They sought
freedom from autocracy, and free-
dom of religious and political expres-
sion. They recognized, as we, that
the doctrine of inherited position
and wealth, and the control of
health, happiness, and life; the doc-
trine of being born to the purple,
has not been justified by the-results.
The pioneers who made, this country
tried to develop a. government ‘by
and for all the people. Democracy
had-its birth in the failure of an-
tocracy. - M . 1 . ’ I
. “A century and a third has been
but a short time in which to de-
velop the practical working of a
government sound, in theory, _«but'dif-
ﬁeult, to I put in ~ execution,” and‘ we
are confronted, today with «unsolved
problems ‘of democracy, in which
broad-minded leadership was never
more necessary. I I '.
“Higher education, as exempliﬁed
in the Pilgrim Fathers, was based
almost entirely on the conception of,
‘education fordeadership, especially
in the learned professions, religion,
law and medicine. The early history
of our country, particularly of New
England, is replete with examples of
such professional leadership, but to-
day intellectuality in leadership is;
relatively less important in the‘
minds of the people. The great re-
wards and social position no longer
follow cutlure, but follow _in. the
wake of. commercial and industrial
success.

“Against the..credit -of these ma-
terial considerations we must set
less of moral and spiritual‘ ﬁber as
debits. Life cannot be-one round of
joy and pleasure. ' All must" work,
and some must work. with the hands.
It. is. our desire to. make life-. more
worth. living for everybody, but’ in

all sorts and conditions of peoples,
have we had due regard for the'e£-
fect of these incoming peoples on
our form of government? The found-
ers of this country strove to retain
the best of the English culture which
they introduced. Later they were

111% of other peoples, -mostiot‘ them
from Teutonic and Scandinavian
countries, who’ quickly became
American xinithought and spirit. But,
more and-more we opened our doors
to peoples with.an entirely diﬁerent
conception of the theory and practice
of‘ government. They relieved us
from manual labor to a large extent,

sturdy independence of our founders
and la demoralizing change in our
sense. of ‘values. In other words,
‘the melting-pot is so full that the
task of keeping the ﬁres of Ameri-

to fuse-the contents is beyond our
strength.’ 0 ‘
“Does our system of
then, teach us. to meet face-to-face
such problems of government? Does
it show us how; to improve our
standards of living without substitut-
ing the material for the spiritual?
Such questions are -intangible, and
most important in ‘education. 'It is
not so important that the student
should memorize. facts‘ and then‘
more facts, as it is that he should”
get the right attitude toward his
fellows. The public prays that the
coming generation will become good
Citizens, and it pays "for higher
education to train men and women-
who can wisely show us the wa
forward. .
. “The -undeniable defect‘ in f a
democracy is that the government
can rise no higher than the‘ average,
intelligence of its people, and, unless

ed, it must remain mediocre.” This
explains our heroic attempts at
general education to raise the gen-
eral level of. intellignce.—

“A witty publicist recently said
that autocracy is . a ship of state
that sails beautifully over smooth
seas, but when it goes on the rocks,
everybody drowns, and that democ-
racy is a, leaky boat in whichour
feet are wet all the time, but the

wet feet of democracy are changing
our national aims and direction. The
checking of immigration, the leveling

factory economic, status, the leveling

of _the moral obligation. In England

chosen by your respective,‘classm-ates
to select the »student }who most
closely conforms to*'the type which
the University should ‘ aim to pro-
duce. _ ' ‘

“Senator _Pepper did not intend, I
am conﬁdent, that in a narrow sense
there is ‘a, single type of student
which the University aims to pro-
duce. The University produces many

types of students, each one of which ‘

is ‘best’ in the eyes of the institu-
tion. There are, however, certain
outstanding qualiﬁcations in the lives
of all students whom the University
looks upon as ‘best.’ ’{

In this letter the Chancellor gave

four of these outstanding qualiﬁca-
tions: health and physical» ﬁtness,
habits of thinking, ideas of success
and culture. ’
. “The ideal student,”,he continued,
“accepts active responsibility for his
share of the teaching; in all that he
laughts at, approves, disa-pprroves,
says, or does, he is true to his own
mark of attainment,~ to the highest
welfare in every way of his fellows;
‘and to the great purpose for which
the University stands in the com-
munity.”

The first award, in 1922, was given
to Lawrence I. Klinestiver, a member
of Phi Gamma Delta and of Omicron
Delta Kappa, who had distinguished
himself as football manager and in
Y. M. C, A. work. ‘ ’

Last year, Charles L. Foster, now
assistant to the Dean loflthe College
and of the School of Education, won
the ‘award. Foster was a member of
the debating team for four years
and held several class offices. He

This is the ﬁrst ‘time, ilrtwo years

have been offered, but, due to the in-

convenience of Ktraveling back and ‘p

interest has been shown in them.
With most of the" work on the cam-

hours each semester. It will not be

SYMPATHY AND'I‘ToLERANcEI

{College students we ﬁnd are many
times radical in their expressions of
opinion. Several times of‘ late has
the idea suggested itself to us of care-
fully noticing and observing the kind
and trend of conversation that is us-
ually to be found among students. So,
whenever the opportunity presents it-
self, as it‘ does very frequently, we
attend to the conversation of our
friends around us for the purpose of
‘discovering their attitude of mind.

The phase of the matter that has
occasioned most surprise to us when
we analyze it, is the amount of criti-
cism entirely favorable or unfavor-
able, ‘as the case may be, that is
passed on men and things. College
students seem; to have very deﬁnite
and decided attitudes toward matters
——so decided indeed that they are of-
tentimes without ‘very much ground.
For instance, we hear professors and
students always called either “oil
cans” or “princes.” They are‘ either
one or the-other. If they are not
“good fellows” then they are “ﬂat
tires.” There is noﬂmiddle ground.
Men are dealt with mercilessly wheth-
er their characters are known or not,
whether their censor is acquainted
with them or not. They are judged
and found wanting, harshly con-
demned to a state of eternal insuﬁi-
ciency.  0'  I

About the same frame of mind is
exhibited in regard to problems and
issues. Views on national politics and
world problems are often radical and
biased. Moderation is‘ noticeably ab-
sent in the pstlmate passed on events,
that is when they are attended to‘ at
all and the usual spirit of indifference
so common to college "students is not
displayed, 1 , '

We would notbe surprised if this
‘lack of reason and moderation were
exhibited by uncouth persons whodo
not acquaint themselves- with, the
many-sidvedn-ess of things and who
take pride in their prejudices and de-
cided but irrational and hasty judg-
ments; but when we ﬁnd the same
quality ‘displayed so widely among
university students, then we maintain
something of a spirit of alarm. ‘ An
university student is presumed to be
cultured, reﬁned and tolerant. And
when we ﬁnd him showing the same
intolerance and lack of sympathy that
‘are’ to be found in the brawling mob,
we are somewhat taken aback.

Herbert Spencer says that there is
a “germ of truth in things erroneous.”
There is something of truth in every
belief, however ridiculous, that rec-
ommends it to men’s ‘mind. Every-
thing can be traced to a basis of re-
ality. ssb it is with men.
always some good in them. and usual-
ly a good deal. If we try to see their
strong points instead of trying to dis-
cover their faults, ‘we shall feel better
and show more fairness and justice.
Just as one must beware. of getting
“soured” on the world, so must he
beware, of becoming “soured” on indi-
viduals. It-is easy to form an unfa-
vorable opinion from ‘a small and dis-
torted circumstan.ce.ﬂ " 

‘What we must try to do is to put
ourselves in tune with all that ‘is
around“us, endeavor. to justify it, and
«discover the reason for it.” First of
all,we should try to be sympathetic,
and broad in our sympathies and our
expressions of them. If we cannot
appreciate after wehave tried, then
it is time to raise a howl’.—Gre'en and

Lewisburg, Pa., June 9.—Jack Spike
Harding, crack shortstop of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh baseball team,
was unanimously elected captain of
the Pitt--varsity nine for the 1925'sea-
son after the game with Bucknell to-

day. Not a dissenting vote was cast -

in the single ballot taken for? the
oﬁice. '
Harding has been a brilliant per-

former all season for Pitt, his work ,_

at short being a deciding factor in
the success of the Pitt nine. With
Charley Carman at third, Bobby Irwin
at second and Lefty Hill at ﬁrst,
Spike has helped give Pitt one of the
best inﬁelds in college circles.

Pitt Beats Bucknell
In Season’s Final

Ira. Lefty Hill, playing the ﬁnal
game of his collegiate career, hurled
a brilliant game Monday afternoon
against Bucknell University, Pitt win-
ning the ﬁnal game of-the season by
a score of 10 to 3. 2

Lefty received miserable support in

the early innings of today’s game,
and Bucknell managed to get in a
couple of timely swats, that netted
three runs in the ﬁrst two frames.

out in the second inning. But Pitt
began to work on Bellak, who hurled
for Bucknell in the third, and gar-
nered ﬁve runs in that frame, adding
to the total with two more in the
sixth, and three in the ninth.

Allan Tarr, the Bucknell ace, who
started the game, threw two high
balls to ‘Charlie Carman and then
winced as hethrew his wonder arm
out on the third ball. Bellak went to
the mound for the remainder of the
game. .
Steve Swetonic had a great day on
the bases, getting on three times and
stealing his way around thrice. Car-
man, while he went hitless, scored

Campus, “Y-”i ‘Hi-it,»
C. A." history was inaugurated last
June by sending ‘sixteen delegates
to the Silver Bay Conference. .- Al-
though this was very satisfactory
both .’in numbers‘. and results, it has
been decided’ that the group this
year shall be much larger.

On September 15, 16 and 17, the
ﬁrst cabinet retreat was carried‘out
at Deer Creek, Pa. Here, in. the
quiet, of ,recre‘atibna11 surroundings,
the program for the. coming year
was worked out in detail;

Before the new Freshmen reached
college -last year, as has been cus-
tomary, the “Y” mailed each one a
“Fresh Bible."-‘~ These. little books
were an aggregation“ of all matter‘
which would be ‘Worth While for new ‘
‘students to know about the school.
To further aid in making: them “feel
at home," a senior councillor plan.
was worked. out and carried into af-
fect at a banquet held on Septem-
ber -25 in the First Baptist Church.
Each Senior was assigned a. few
‘Freshmen whom ‘he met: at the ban-

of its institutions, . t

A ﬁnancial campaign, which was
both, conducted and received with
unusual enthusiasm, served to ex-
press the growing favorofv‘ the Pitt"
“Y” as an institution. The. great
enlargement of the supportwhich it
has received permitted a much more
ambitious» campaign than had been
expected. ' «  g

Some interesting weekly meetings
‘Were held at the hut throughout the
year. On Tuesday evenings an
open forum was held to discuss fea-
tures of political and social life as
they Came up. On Wednesday
noons, luncheons, addressed regular-
ly by such speakers as Dr.-' 
Ewers, Dr. ‘C. W. Petty and Dr. J.
-M. McConnell were held.’-

A high degree of good fellowship
was produced in the Evening School
Division of the Y‘. M. C. A. by week-_
ly luncheons held in the Kaufmann‘
and; Beer dining room. These meet-
ings came to form a popular .meeting

successful largely by the actual sup-
port of the Evening ,9 School Associa-
tion ‘and the various ‘fraternities of»,
the Evening‘ School. - - 
One of the most useful branches
of aid this year was the securing of
about. ﬁfteen students to ‘lead: and
