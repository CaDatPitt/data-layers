Campus police enacted a new policy
yesterday which prohibits the public from
accessing the campus police records.
Prohibiting access to these records is a
violation of the Open Records Act,
according to Mark Goodman, the executive
director of the Student Press Law Center.

“If the public could look at these police
records, police would withhold relevant
information and not give the complete
story that would help with the case,” said

John Yeager, vice president for

administration, who enacted this new
policy. “Campus police will provide brief
summaries of the report to the public that
give the relevant facts.”

According to Goodman, this is

unwarranted. “The state Open Records
Act requires the campus police by law to
provide access to police logs and other
records they maintain.”

The Open Records Act said that every
citizen has the right to look at public
records.

“The campus police enacted this new
policy as a way to ensure students’ identities
are protected and to protect the university

from lawsuits if the students’ identities are
accidentally released,” said Yeager.
Goodman said, “There is absolutely no
way the simple release of a student’s name
could lead to liability of the university.”
“Many” schools give public access to
their campus police reports and public
records. Some schools even said crime
decreased with this access because the

Groups plan teach—in

By Eric Hoch
Staff Writer

The Faculty and Staff for Peace and the Pittsburgh Students
for Peace have planned a teach-in on Feb. 20 and a trip to Kent
State this Saturday to attend a rally for peace, according to Pitt
Professor Dennis Brutus.

“For our teach-in, we will be asking President [Wesley] Posvar
to assist by allowing us to use a room and help us in other
necessities, and we will also contact the Student Government
Board to support us during our teach~in,” said Brutus.

“We also passed a resolution to demand a cease-fire in the
Middle East, and we hope to get other groups on campus to
take this stand," said Brutus.

According to PSfP member Jill Castek, Kent State will be the
site for a rally for peace to honor students who died there
during a rally on May 4, 1970.

The blood drive, held on Feb. 1 by the PSfP, was so successful
that only 75 of 145 donors could give blood due to the limited

A student journal of
conservative opinion is scheduled
to appear on campus sometime
next week, according to its editor
in chief.

The Progressive Edge will make
its debut on campus, funded by
an allocation from the Student
Government Board. The first three
issues of the paper have already
been funded. According to Editor
in Chief Robert Lewis, the paper
will come out monthly.

“These days on a great many
campuses, and to an extent at
Pitt, the administration and the
faculty and student groups, and
the campus media too  are
monopolized by people who can

be described as having a liberal
viewpoint,” said Lewis.

Lewis said he hopes that a
publication like his with
conservative viewpoints will
expose students to all sides of
every issue so that they can make
their own decisions.

“The thing is, conservatism and
moderation are not viewpoints
that you find among the student
groups and the campus media,
and there’s a reason for that,” he
said.

“A lot of students who are
conservative are very, very busy,
with their studies especially, and
a great many of them have jobs
and other activities as well, but
they do not have the time to, say,
start writing columns for The Pitt
News or regularly go to College

Republican meetings,” said lewis.
Lewis cites The Pitt News’

coverage of the Persian Gulf _

situation as an example of how
the viewpoints of The Pitt News
do not necessarily reflect the
views of the campus community.

“ The Pitt News, in its coverage
of the Persian Gulf situation has
been  very receptive toward the
anti~war viewpoint, and really I
don't see much wrong with that,
except that a poll taken by 7hePiti
News showed that more students
on this campus support action in
the Middle East than oppose it,”
he said.

operations manager of The
Dispatch, Oakland’s independent

Iraq shuts off fuel supplies in Baghdad

By Jeff Tatusko

Perspective Editor

Iraq has come to a standstill.

Because of the bombardment of Iraqi oil
supplies, the government in Baghdad shut
off the supply of all fuels for domestic use. It
is now illegal to sell fuel for cars and homes
alike. Scenes of people pushing their cars
along the road were common in Baghdad.

, Iraqi radio blamed the bombing of supply
convoys and storage tanks for the cutback.

In other developments:

~The US. military conﬁrmed yesterday
that American fighter jets shot down at least
two Iraqi jets heading for the Iranian border.
Officials said that it was possible that two
more were downed in the attack.

So far, as many as 120 Iraqi jets have ﬂown
into Iran, where the Iranian government has
vowed to detain them until the end of the
conflict. If this number is accurate, along with
approximately 50 Iraqi jets destroyed in
combat and on the ground, the Iraqis have
lost about 17 percent of their air, force.

This is the first announcement, however,
that Iraqi jets have been shot down while
trying to reach the border.

oBaghdad is now shutting the anti-Iraqi
coalition out of the country.

     

 ;{,

IN THE GULF

The government announced that it has
severed all diplomatic ties with countries
associated with the coalition. This exclusion
includes the United States, Great Britain,
France, Italy, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

-Another peace initiative has surfaced; this
one is from Jordan.

Jordan’s King Hussein pleaded with both
sides yesterday to accept a cease-fire and
begin negotiations to end the conflict.
President Bush said repeatedly that the allies
will not accept a cease-fire until Iraq agrees
to leave Kuwait. There is no word yet about
the Iraqi response.

-Iraq claimed that the allies have bombed
the town of Nassariyah. They reported that
150 civilians were killed in the overnight raid.
Baghdad Radio said that President Bush
“lied” when he said that the allies were not
concerned with destroying Iraq. The report
also said that the allies have bombed scientific,
economic, Cultural, religious and medical

facilities within Iraq. These reports Cannot be
confirmed. .

oAllied bombing seems to have taken a {O11
on the Iraqi Scud missiles. Gen. Thomas Kelly
said yesterday that there have been no Scud
launches since Saturday, and that 811 Of Eh‘?
recent launches have been relatively
ineffective. "

The British Royal ‘ Air Force said that
yesterday British Tornado fighter bombers
knocked out another Scud launcher in
northwest Iraq.

oThe United Nations will meet to discuss
the Persian Gulf situation. ,

Diplomats from the U.N. said yesterday that
the Security Council will meet privately for a
discussion on the crisis.

The U.N. also announced that it would
begin sending emergency medical supplies

to Iraqi women and children as early as next '

week.

oFinally, the war is having an unexpected
effect here at home. Sports Illustrated
announced that its annual swimsuit issue
would be toned down because of the war.
The magazine, released yesterday, features a
model in a conservative, one-piece suit.
Officials said that the normal hype for the
issue has decreased because they feel it
would not be appropriate.

Increase in poisonings prompts opening of treatment program

By Ross Pasquale
Sta1fWrtter

A regional toxicology treatment
program, established recently by
the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, aims to provide
care for victims of poisoning who
require intensive medical
treatment.

“The American Association of
Poison Control Centers has
reported a 100—percent increase
in intentional ingestions in adults
over the last six years,” said Daniel
Cobaugh, Pharm. D., program
coordinator. '

Pitt was an ideal place to
establish such a program,
according to Dr. Thomas Martin,
program director and emergency-
department physician at
Montefiore Hospital, where the
program is based.

“We have a ~ significant

p advantage in the management ‘of «
critically ill and unusual- overdose

patients. We have compiled an
extensive supply of common and
uncommon antidotes for
numerous toxins, recruited
physicians trained in medical
toxicology and have specially
trained nurses for the care of
overdose patients. A unique
component is the immediate

availability of psychiatric
consultants from Western
Psychiatric Institute 8: Clinic, who
will begin their evaluation while
the patient is still in the emergency
department,” Martin said.

“The reason why we're seeing
more and more toxicology
programs is that in the last 10
years, there have been more
medical toxicologists trained.
Now there are 150 [certified
medical toxicologists]. Now that
they’re all out in practice, we are
frequently being consulted by
poison-control centers,” said
Martin.

Alcohol intoxication is an area

of concern to medical
toxicologists; however, relatively
few college students are treated
by the program. Special events,
such as homecoming, often cause
students to drink more heavily
than they would otherwise,
according to Martin. It is very
important that those who need
medical attention receive it and
receive the right kind, he said.
“If a student is minimally
responsive, then we would empty
their stomach and provide them
with glucose if they needed it.
Blood sugar can go very low.
They can look like they’re still
drunk, but actually they’re not

functioning normally because of
the low blood-sugar level,” said
Martin.

The major symptom of alcohol
intoxication is unconsciousness.
If a person is unable tobe aroused
by conventional means, including
face-slapping and rough shaking,
medical attention may be needed.
People have died from severe
intoxication by suffocating on
their own vomit or sustaining a
severe head injury after a fall,
according to Martin. L

A severely intoxicated person
should first be referred to a
poison-control center, Martin said.
If needed, he or she will be

referred to a treatment program.
An antidote that reverses the
intoxicating effects of alcohol is
under study. It may be a while
before this compound is available
for sale — if it ever is.
“Manufacturers are afraid that
physicians will use it to wake up
people who are drunk, and then

they’ll go out and drink some

more,” Martin said.

While the drug counteracts the
effects of alcohol on the central
nervous system, the heart can
still retain a high amount of
toxicity. If the person drinks more,

Air Force ROTC honors Arteaga

By Mike Hudson
Sta_[f Writer

Overcast skies and rain
provided a ﬁtting atmosphere on
campus yesterday when members
of the Pitt Air Force ROTC
detachment gathered behind the

-Cathedral of Learning for a

memorial service honoring the
first Pitt graduate killed in the
Persian Gulf war.

Eighty cadets and six staff
members, along with a handful
of onlookers, bowed their heads
in a moment of silence as the flag
was lowered and “Taps” was
played in memory of Lt. Jorge

Arteaga, a 1987 Pitt graduate.

Arteaga, along with two other
airmen, was killed when his B-52
bomber crashed into the Indian
Ocean on return from a mission.

“_]orge’s love of the military
allowed him to go above and
beyond his obligation. As a cadet,
he always did more than was
expected of him," said Colonel
John Stecklow, Air Force ROTC
detachment commander.

The cadets tied yellow ribbons
to trees on the cathedral lawn to
offer an additional gesture of
respect to Arteaga, as well as to
the prisoners of war and soldiers
missing in action in the gulf.

Stecklow said that cadets here
are very supportive of the military
action being conducted in the
gulf, and he hoped that public
support will remain high.

“It means so much to troops
that the public remains
supportive,” Stecklow said.

Stecklow said he supports the
leaders in Washington, D.C., and
the way the operation is being
conducted. _

“We are all praying that the loss I

A Yeager said the summaries would include complete facts to
the public, including the time and place of the incident, but
would withhold the names of the students.

“Campus police put information in these reports that will help
with the follow-up on the investigation. If we allow the public
to see these reports, the police will not put in all of the relevant

“The campus police, like the city police, must provide public
access to police reports. If a citizen went to a city police station
asking to see the police reports, they have the right to look at
them. The same holds true for the campus police,” said

There are currently two lawsuits pending in which the
campus police are being sued by editors of college newspapers
for access to campus police records. '

said. .

According to Martin, the
chemical warfare that may
be used in the Middle East
is very difficult to combat.
There are at least four
common nerve gases
capable of causing rapid
death if the victim is
exposed to a high enough
concentration. A person
could die after one or two
minutes of exposure.
Soldiers wear gas masks
and are immunized against
nerve gases.

“It doesn’t appear that
nerve gases will be too
effective against a well-
prepared army. It would
still be very effectiveon an
unprepared civilian
population,” said Martin.

For counteractive agents
to be effective, they must
be administered very soon
after exposure occurs.
Hydrogen mustard gas, a
chemical weapon that is
not a nerve gas, is absorbed
by the skin within two
minutes after exposure. It
causes burns to the lungs
and skin and suppresses
the bone marrow.

ISIS ma/ees information more accessible

By Kim Palmiero
For T be Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
began using a new computer
system in March 1990 in an attempt
to provide more efficient
administrative services to students
and administration.

The Integrated Student
Information System, or ISIS,
combines information into an on-

line system which is easily

accessible from different
administrative offices.

The system took approximately
four years to develop with the
help of computer analysts from
Computing and Information
Services. A new computer system
was desperately needed,
according to Charles Heins,
director of CIS.

“The old system was 18 to 20
years old, and information was
not easily accessible,” he said.

Computerization and
automation at the university is
becoming more prolific. “Since
ISIS, understanding of computing
is increasing,” Heins said.

Before ISIS, departments were
often required to keep separate
files for each student. However,
with the new system, recruiting,
admissions, financial aid, course
inventory, class scheduling, on-
campus housing and meals,
student registration, accounts and
transcripts are all integrated into
a major ongline system.

Although the system is over 95-

   
   

All insurance forms processed‘

percent integrated into the
university, there is still a lot of

‘work to be done. Heins stressed

that improvements are constantly
being made based on input from
users.

“Now that the major
components of the system have
been implemented, we are
working on implementing more
details,” he said.

One user, Professor Donald
McBurney, chairman of the
budget—policies committee,
voiced some dissatisfaction with
ISIS. (

Although he said that there
was no question that the university
needed a new computerized
information system, he
complained that the system is
awkward. ,

“Screens and reports are clumsy
and are not user friendly,”,he

said.

McBurney also felt that there
was not enough communication
among potential users and the
people who were tailoring the
system. He suggested a system
which would allow students to
register on their own, cutting
down on administrative work and
long lines.

“Given a system of this size, it
is a given that some individuals
are not satisfied with the system,”
said Heins.

He expressed optimism that as
people get used to ISIS, network
operations will become easier
and more efficient. “There is
ongoing training still available on
how to use the system,” he said.

“For the university as a whole
it’s been a tremendous help and
well deserved by the students
and academic units,” said Heins.

“Those students who were
turned away were given a card
that told them where they could
give blood specifically in support
of the troops,” Castek said.

This Sunday, the PSH’ and
Students Against Racism will co-
sponsor a workshop about Islam.

Castek said, “This event will
hopefully educate people about
the Islamic people and show
others that they are a lot like us.
The meeting is at 7:30 [p.m.] and
will be held in Room 232, at the
Cathedral [of Learning]. We feel
that there has been a lot of racism
shown to Arab people in the
United States.”

The PSfP, according to Castek,
will be helping Carnegie Mellon
students plan a peace rally at CM
on Feb. 21.

“This date is the day that
Malcolm X died,” said Castek.
“We feel it is very appropriate
because he sought to change
what was wrong through non-
violent means.”

“We are also trying to raise
money to help the war refugees,”
said Castek. The program will be
based on networking, where one
person will give $1 and get five
other people to give $1 and so
on, according to Castek. A fund-

__raiser will also be held to raise

money for the war refugees.
Castek said the PSfP will be

composing a poetry journal that

will allow students to express

their ideas about the crisis.

To swerve and deflect...

When people think of censorship in the media these
days, they normally think of the war being fought in the
Persian Gulf. However, censorship has now hit closer to,
home in the name of “protection.”

The University of Pittsburgh’s Public Safety Department,
namelyjohn Yeager, vice president of administration, has
decided that the public no longer has the right to see
campus police reports.

For those who do not understand the implications of
this, we repeat: in direct violation of the Freedom of
Information Act, the University of Pittsburgh has decided
to withhold police reports from not onlyTbe PittNews but
from the general public as well.

The Freedom of Information Act, passed in 1975,
implicitly stated that the public has access to such
documents as police records, court records and
investigation reports.

According to Yeager, the university has commenced in
this action because it is fearful of being faced with liability
charges. If names of victims or suspects are released, he

 said, the university could be held responsible. Yeager also

I could not understand why The Pitt News is so upset. “We

provide complete facts: time, place of incident and
withhold the names,” he said.

Yeager claimed that police reports would be inaccurate
if the public could see them. “If the public could look at
these police records, police would withhold relevant
information and not give the complete story that would
help with the case," he said.

. He failed to realize, however, that the public has always
had access to the names of the people in the reports.
Many people do not take advantage of that right, but this
does not give Yeager that kind of authority.

Yeager claims that the university can do this because of
the Buckley Amendment. This ruling, passed in 1974,
stated that schools can lose federal funding if they release
student education records.

This has been attempted before, at Oakland University
in Michigan. That campus tried to use this excuse to
withhold campus police records from the student
newspaper. The newspaper ﬁled suit against the university,
citing the Freedom of Information Act. On the night.
before the hearing, the school conceded that there was an
exception to the Buckley Amendment: campus police
records.

There are currently two cases pending against universities
because the schools withheld information from the public.
But the university must not be allowed to do this. Students
on this campus must rise up. Tell the university that you
want to know what is happening on your campus. The Pitt
News surely will.

Friends for Animals respond  

This letter is in response to the
editorial written by T om Lester in
thejan. 28 edition of TbePittNews.
As members of Friends of Animals,
we resent the implication that
our student group and the animal-
rights movement support such
atrocities as the use of leghold
traps and giving dogs food “laced
with ground glass and rat poison. ”
These allegations are obviously
in opposition to everything the
animal-rights movement stands
for.

Lester neglected to address the
real issue. Hunting is a cruel
practice that is carried out for fun.
“Sportsmen” may claim to fulfill a
legitimate role of population
control. If this is so, why do some
states have “buck only”
regulations when killing doe
would better control the
population? Why has Michigan
administered its Deer Range
Improvement Program, which
included clearcutting thousands
of acres of old—growth forests to
increase numbers of deer
available for shooting? Why have
predator-elimination programs
been administered against natural
predators such as mountain lions
(US. News and World Report, 5
Feb 90)? Love of nature? Why are
more than 3000 private bird-
shooting ranches and more than
1000 mammal—shooting ranches
operating in the U.S.? In general,
hunters are not concerned with
controlling animal populations.

Lester said that non-hunters do
not subsidize hunting, but

according to Ron Baker in The,

American Hunting Myth, during

-.one recent typical year the funds

allocated to the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service amounted to $235
million. Of this, $87 million came
from the sale of duck stamps,
taxes on fishing gear, and excise
taxes on the sale of ﬁrearms and
ammunition. The remaining $ 1 48
million came from general tax
revenues. Since only about 15
percent of the employed U.S.
population are hunters, about 85
percent of theseincome-tax funds

Letters

came from non-hunting
taxpayers. This means that over
half of the federal game-
management programs are
directly financed by non—hunters!
It is ridiculous to assert that
animal-rights activists are anti-
environmentalists. In October
1990, Friends of Animals co-
sponsored a presentation of “The
Last Great Wilderness” to help
save the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge. Mobilization for Animals,
a local animal-rights group, has
acted to help preserve a parcel of
wetlands from development in
Irwin, Pa., as a wildlife refuse.
There is an undeniable
connection between animal and
environmental concerns, despite
our ignorance of nature. Animal
activists donate large sums of

money to environmental causes,

without expecting‘ to be
reimbursed with a set of antlers.
Mr. Lester, did you contact anyone
from Friends of Animals before
you wrote your fallacious article?
Obviously not.

we have noticed a great
improvement, and we're very,
very pleased. Lothrop Hall and
myself would like to express our
thanks and appreciation to the

associate director of housing, Bob .

Robinson and the supervisor of
mailroorns, Wayne Thompson,
for the improved service. I’ve
heard no complaints!

Mail has been received on time

Noreaction foradministration

Recent demands set forth by
the Faculty and Staff for Peace
concerning the administration’s
refusal to take a political stance
on the issue of war in the Persian
Gulf, leads one to some disturbing
conclusions.

First of all, there seems to be a
few very precarious differences
between the peace activists of
the 1960s and those of today. The
peace activists of the '60s

adamantly supported freedom of ’

expression and the right to speak
one’s mind. Today, however, a
different breed of war protesters
have launched an assault on these
basic First Amendment freedoms.
As evidence, take for instance the
tone of the FSP letter to President
Posvar; “We write to express our
opposition to the United States’
initiation of war in the Persian
Gulf and to urge you to
communicate to President Bush
strong objections to his military
attack against Iraq.” What the
letter implies is that President
Posvar has no right to remain
impartial to the gulf situation.
And not only does FSP demand
that President Posvar take a"
position on the war, but also that
he condemn President Bush's
policy, as if to assert that President
Posvar can only choose the anti-
war position. (I really wonder
how peacefully FSP would react
if President Posvar publicly
endorsed the war.)[...l

What's scary about all of this is
that the people leading this
crusade of censorship and
radicalism are none other than
Pitt professors themselves. The
faculty members of FSP should
step off their soapboxes and
return to their lecterns — or, then
again, maybe they shouldn't.

Swimmers
seek ninth

Big East

victory

By Jim Lakely

3 sum" Writer

Everyone shoots for No.
1. This weekend at Trees
Pool, Big East swimmers
will have their guns pointed

at Pitt’s men’s swimming _’

and diving team, trying to
end the Panthers’ streak of
eight consecutive Big East
Championships.

Entering this season, Pitt
was once again favored to
win the Big East Champion-
ship. As in yearspast, Syra-
cuse will push this Panther
team to swim faster, but a
new serious contender for
the crown is coming to town
——— the Villanova Wildcats.‘

Earlier this year, Syracuse
beat Pitt in a dual meet, but
the Orangemen’s depth is
questionable, and accor-
ding to swimmer Eric
Mattson, Syracuse is not a
serious threat.

A few monthsalater the
Panthers beat Villanova, but
found out that the Wildcats
are C for real. Villanova

- exploited Pitt’s weakness -

in the backstroke and made
the meet very close. This
concerns some of Pitt’s
swimmers.

“Everyone thought it
wouldbe Syracuse pushing
us for the title, butVillanova
has shown us that they are
tough too,” said junior Fred
Constantini.

“We trained really well in
the Bahamas [over holiday
break],” said ,Don Boyd.
“And the fact that we have
shaved and tapered for this
meet, as opposed for the
Eastern Seaboards, will be
a big help. We are conﬁdent
that we can win, but it
won’t be a cakewalk.
Villanova and Syracuse will
be shooting for us.” I

“The team we are most
afraid of is ourselves.
Swimming is one of those
sports that is really
psychological,” said Brian
Deiderick. “Positive attitude
is the ultimate thing to have.
We have to keep in mind
that it doesn’t_matter what
other people do. It just

\ matters how fast we swim.”

Although this is, the
culmination of the regular
season, it is not the
swimmers’ last opportunity
to qualify for postseason
meets. They can go to a
backup meet called the
Pennsylvania Open next
week to make Eastern
Seaboard cuts.

ap losing streak

By Rob Mazur
Staff Writer

The Pitt Lady Panthers entered
Wednesday night’s game against
Syracuse with a two-game losing
streak. Pitt overcame a weak first-
half _performance and a scrappy
Orangewomen team, snapping
their streak with a 62-54 victory.

Pitt improved its record to 12-
10 overall, 7-4 in the Big East
Conference. Syracuse dropped

' to 3-18, 0-11 in the Big East.

The Lady Panthers received a
scare from the Orangewomen,
trailing 51-50 with only 2 minutes
and 41 seconds left in the game.
Pitt, however, went on a 12-3 run
to end the game and seal the
victory.

From the beginning Syracuse
showed that it would not lay
down and die. The Orange-
women controlled the game and
never allowed the Lady Panthers

to lead by more than two.

Pitt came out of the locker
room on ﬁre, taking an eight-
point, 50-42 lead before Syracuse
made a last-ditch effort.

“Syracuse is no easy opponent,”
said Pitt Coach Kirk Bruce. “They
have lost their last ﬁve games
before this one by an average of
3.3 points.” '

The Lady Panthers were battling
more than just Syracuse, however.
Starting point guard Maureen

‘McConnell and forward Jill

McE1hinny are still recovering
from an injured hip and leg,
respectively.

Lorrijohnson led the team with
19 points and 12 rebounds. “Lorri
played really hard,” said Bruce.
“She always plays hard, but I
think she realizes she only has a

‘limited number of games left. She

just let it all out tonight.”
Erin Maloy scored 16 points
and had ﬁve steals in 33 minutes.

“Erin did a great job. She handled .

the ball well and hit some tough
three-pointers. Anyone can hit a
three—pointer, but the ones she
made- were really tough,” said

Bruce. .

Bruce felt that an outside factor
had a big impact on the game. “I
think the thing that made the big

difference for us tonight, though, .

was the band and the
cheerleaders. We’ve won both
this game and the [Connecticut]
game when they were there. They

~ give us a lift,” said Bruce.

Asst. Sports Editor,

It is 10 p.m. last Sunday in the producer’s
office of WPTS-FM. Steve Liss waits
anxiously by the phone. Two minutes
later, the phone finally rings.

Liss breathes a sigh of relief and picks it
up. Bruce Hamburger, assistant coach for

«the Seton Hall Pirates, is on the line, just in
time for the opening credits of the WPTS-
FM (98.5) Sunday night Sports Call-In Show.

All week long, Liss tried to book a Seton
I—_Ia1t‘assistant as a guest, but nothing was
conﬁrmed until about 9:30" Sunday night.

The call—in show began last summer but
was cancelled in December due to poor
organization. Liss successfully petitioned
to get the show back on the air. Hamburger
was the show’s first guest ever, ‘a’concept
that Liss hopes to continue every week,
eventually booking Penguin and Pirate
players as well as current and former
Panthers.

Wrestler Miller's work ethic credit to athletics

“We had a lot of problems with‘ it last year,”

said Liss. “People came in ‘ﬁve minutes before

they went on the air and didn’t bother to study
up on the topics. All we would talk about were
that day’s football games.

“Now, basically Jeff [Shurilla, WPTS sports
director] gave me ‘control of the show, because
no one else wanted to do it. Everybody

wanted to do the show, but nobody wanted to

put any work into it. Everybody wanted to be
in the limelight, to be on the air. So I said I
would stay behind the scenes, if that’s what it
takes to keep it going.”

Hamburger discusses Big East basketball
with hosts Kyle Knauff and Jon Linder for 10
minutes, after which listeners are invited to
call in and discuss the state of Pitt sports.

For the next 10 minutes, however, the
phone remains silent. Knauff and Linder offer
their own views on the subject. Finally, at
10:20 p.m., a call comes in. It’s Eric from Point
Breeze. Topic: Pitt basketball’s recent troubles,
one of three topics scheduled for the night.

“We meet before the show to discuss three

topics that will be discussed that night,” said
Liss. “Tonight, we’ll talk about the downfall of
Pitt sports in recent years, and baseball salaries,
whether they’re outrageous or whether they’re
getting what they deserve."

At 10:30, the phone rings again. Caller No.
2. It’s Rodney.

“Hello. Who’s this? Rodney? What do you
want to talk about, Rodney? What? No, we’re

not giving away free tickets. This is a sports ,

OK, thanks anyway.” Click.

For T be Pitt News

, A tremendous work ethic,
intense desire and dedication, an
unselﬁsh attitude and multiple
seasons of experience are earning
respect and recognition for Pitt
heavyweight wrestler Perry Miller.

The redshirt junior is the second
Pitt News Athlete of the Week.
Miller has compiled an impressive
record of 13-6-1 this season,
including a dynamite slate of 9-2’-
1 in dual—meet competition. Miller
hasbeen a bright spot in a tough
season for the Panthers, who are

'RttATHLETE§WEEK C

3-9 this season.

Miller has been gaining
momentum and attention lately,
following major victories over
two outstanding opponents. He
defeated Lehigh’s John Morris,
who is nationally ranked, by a
score of 6-4, and Donald Evans
(19-5) of Bloomsburg by a 4-1
margin.

It appears as though nothing
can stop Miller from reaching his
full potential. Pitt Coach Rande

Stottlemyer said that Miller wasn’t
as highly recruited as some
wrestlers coming out of high
school but his work ethic is
unmatched.

As team captain he is “a real
quiet kind of guy who leads by
example,” said Stottlemyer. “He’s
not a big talker; he’s a doer.
That's the best way to describe
Perry.

“Perry’s been doing a great job
for us; he works really hard. He’s
a real good competitor. We've
been really pleased with his effort
this year,” said Stottlemyer, who
added that Miller’s academic work

in mechanical engineering has
been excellent.

Miller’s 3.0 grade-point average
is yet another example of his
dedication. “Wrestling makes it
more difficult to get good grades,
but it also forcesme to budget my
time better,” said Miller.

Motivation has certainly been
no problem for Miller. “I love to
wrestle, and my family’s always
been real supportive,” he said.
His parents and grandmother
attend every match, and his
mother even sings the national
anthem before some matches.

Solid performance at Kent State not enough for gymnasts

By Sharon Kerestes
Staﬂ" Writer

After decisive wins and near
record-breaking team scores in
the first two meets, the men’s
gymnastics team suffered its first
loss Saturday at the hands of
Kent State, 269.40-267.85.

As in the previous two meets, '

Pitt brought itself down with
major breaks on two events. But
unlike the previous two meets,
the competition was too good to
allow for any misses, and Pitt
wound up on the losing end of a
very close meet. _

The Panthers knew Kent would
be tough, and after the first event,
floor exercise, they were up by
only six-tenths of a point. ‘Still,
Pitt’s routines were solid, and

four gymnasts scored 9.0 or better. I

The Panthers then failed to hit
their routines on pommel horse
and found themselves down by
over a point after two events.
(Last week at the Shenandoah
Valley Invitational, they broke
the school record on pommels.)

I Pitt redeemed itself in the rings

and cut Kent's lead to less than
four-tenths. Four Panthers placed
in the top five, led by Genaro
Severino, who won the event
with a 9.35.

Pitt also won the vault, led
again by Severino, and finished
four events tied with Kent. But
Kent edged Pitt on parallel bars
and regained the lead going into
the last event, 22565-22320. The

Panthers had the chance to win it
on high bar but lost due to
mistakes.

“We broke on pommels, which
is when it got tight," said Coach
Frank D’Amico. “Then we fell
apart on high bar. We had four
out of six misses. When you miss,
you throw the meet away, and in
this close situation you’ve got to
hit.”

But the Panthers had more than
their own mistakes going against
them. They only competed with
one nine-man team in an attempt
to qualify their team score for
regionals, while Kent forfeited
the chance“ to get a qualifying

score and competed with 12
gymnasts, the maximum allowed.

“They were just out to beat us,”
senior captain Jorge Gonzalez
said. “Meanwhile, we went there
to beat them and to get a score for
regionals.”

Pitt also felt the judges, two of

_whom are former Kent State

gymnasts, were biased.

“We were outnumbered,”
D’Amico said. “They had too
many judges against us."

He said Pitt’s scores actually
weren’t that far off. “Most of the
time their scores were within a
couple of tenths of whatl thought
we should be getting,” he said.

However, he felt Kent was

“I don’t want to dwell on the

events, we probably would’ve
won —— barely.

“We knew we didn't do the

and, as always, eliminating
mistakes.

“With no injuries, if [our team
score] doesn’t go up anywhere
from four to ten points by the end

S/e2’ teams head north

By Brandy L. Simms -
For The Pitt News

The Panther ski—racing team traveled to northeastern
Pennsylvania last weekend to compete against its Allegheny
Collegiate ‘Ski Conference opponents.

The team skied Eagle Rock, located in'Hazelton, Pa., on
Saturday. The Pitt women finished fifth at Eagle Rock.
Individually, Erin DeSantis had the top performance, finishing
in fourth place, while Jennifer Giovannitti placed sixth.

The men’s team, which ﬁnished eighth overall, was led
individually by Derek St. Clair and Nick Puzzuolo, who finished
30th and 34th, respectively. “Eagle Rock was such a crazy, crazy
course,” said ski—racing team president Tina Negi. “It was the
shortest course I’ve ever raced.”

The team skied Elk Mountain on Sunday,where the women
capped off the weekend by ﬁnishing fourth overall.

“Hey, we’re here to get

become sports broadcasters. And
this provides some hands-on

game with 48 against the Panthers.
Who previously held the record?

Answer: Dana Barros of Boston
College, who scored 43 points
against Pitt in 1989.

That answer was worth a free
pizza to Mick from Oakland, the
first caller who guessed correctly.

At 10:50 p.m., Grant in Squirrel
Hill closes out the hour, making
it five calls in all, something that
the station hopes to change once
people know about the show.

“A lot of people don’t even
know we have a radio station, let
alone that we have a show like
this . . . [But] it ran much smoother
than last year. For the first show,
I thought it was organized
excellent. I’m looking forward to
seeing it work,” said Linder.

“I think given the amount of
preparation that we did, it’s a vast
improvement over last semester,”
said Knauff. “Steve’s taken over
and made everything a lot easier.

The guest was up in the air for a;

while  but we were ready.”

Miller ——

Continued from page 8

He wrestled at the 190—pound
weight class during two previous
seasons at Pitt before redshirting
last year. Stottlemyer said that the
6-foot-5 Miller needed to become
bigger and stronger. “He’s in that
weight room all the time,” said
Stottlemyer.

The weight training has resulted
in a 225-pound frame and a move
to the heavyweight division. In

preparation for this season, Miller I

traveled to Europe over the
summer to wrestle in an
international tournament that
featured Olympic-caliber
competition.

Stottlemyer said that Mil1er’s
experience has contributed to his
overwhelming success this
season. “He’s a very coachable
kid, and he’s worked himself into

being very competitive,” said K

Stottlemyer.

Miller said that he worked very
hard on developing his defense,
especially improving his balance
on one leg. Of his team, Miller
said of his team, “We’re all trying
real hard. A lot of injuries and bad
luck have hurt us, basically.”

Stottlemyer feels that Miller has
an excellent chance to qualify for
nationals. “He’ll meet up with
some pretty stiff competition, and
Perry will be competitive with
just about any heavyweight he
wrestles.” The titles of All-
American and National Champion
are definitely within his reach,
according to Stottlemyer.

“He has to set his goals high.
I’m certain that he is capable of
becoming an All-American before
he’s done here,” said Stottlemyer.

“My ultimate goal is [winning]
an NCAA championship,” said
Miller. “I feel that if I put forth my
best effort, I can achieve these
goals.”

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1991 PAGE S-6
By Monica Novak

Staﬂ“ Writer

Image is everything in the ’90s.
Bob Wagner, founder of The Little
Wretches, complains that many
young bands just starting out
“have attitude galore and this
idea that they’re going to be the
next stars of the planet. They
have this fantasy that they will be
the next true liberators of rock ‘n’
roll.”

But the Wretches aren’t a new
band, and they aren’t concerned
with image. Well into adulthood,
they attack their music with
professionalism while still
maintaining their day jobs.
(However, they admit that they
like to take their music more
seriously than their present
careers.)

Struggling for recognition since
1985, the band has finally
stumbled upon what they
consider the right combination:
Wagner on guitar, Ellen
Hildebrand on bass, Dave Losi
on keyboards, Greg Bielski on
drum machine and all members
contributing to vocals and lyrics.

“The four of us have the same
goal in mind. We all have a
serious commitment to the band.
The chemistry between us just
can’t be matched,” says Bielski,
the newest member and longtime
follower of the band. He makes
his living at a print shop.

This dedication has ﬁnally paid
off in the success of their critically
acclaimed album, Another Nail
in My Coﬂin, which was released
in August 1990. Previously, they
had some international airplay
with the release of their singles,
“Born With a Gift” and “Just About
Due,” the latter reaching No. 5 on
the French charts.

They have just finished “mixing
down" —— that is, setting the sound
levels and ﬁne-tuning their latest
album, Beyond the Stormy Blast,
to be released this spring. They
hope to put out another album
by fall 1991.

“We have enough backlog
material to produce at least four
or ﬁve more albums. That’s how
much faith we have in the band.
Songs we wrote five years ago
are still good,” says Wagner.

Wagner, a high-school teacher
with a degree in English, vents
his creative energy by writing the
majority of the band’s songs.
Motivated by compassion, hope
and realism, the lyrics express an
understanding of the underdogs,
people trapped by circumstance,
and they challenge them to
change.

“Largest of Small Towns," a
song off Beyond th eStormyBlast,
talks of the stagnation of living in
a small, dying town and the
desperation to get out. Another
song, “Dark Times,” epitomizes
the apathy in our country today.

While their songs convey strong
messages, Wagner vows that

'lI°IElIIE PITT NEWS

they're “not going to preach.”

Losi, a machinist by trade,
explains, “We want to make
people aware, to open their eyes,
to stop and think, to try to feel
what’s around them."

Hildebrand adds, “We observe,
comment and write. We are
motivated by inspiration. If we
are moved enough to write about
it, we write about it.”

Their name, quite fitting of their

outlook, was inspired by a scene

from the French film, 400 Blows.
Wagner, who was watching the
film about juvenile delinquents,
was struck by a scene that
depicted “some kids stealing some
apples or something. The
shopkeeper yells, ‘Stop, you little
wretches!’ and I said, ‘Hey, that’s
us.”’

Although they might feel like
victims of circumstance and lack
the resources they need to entirely

dedicate their lives to what they

 

IN

Review of City Theatre's Steel Kiss

love best, things are finally starting
to come together for them.

Recently, things started to take
off after their bassist moved to a
sheep farm. The band set up
shop in her dining room and
began producing on their own
independent label, Bam! Bam!
Records.

It’s not surprising that things
began to fall into place. The
seclusion of the country provides
an excellent environment for them

to reflect on their thoughts and
write those moving, heartfelt
lyrics.

“Everything we had to fight to
do in the past just happened,”

says Wagner. “The networking is

starting to put itself together, and
if things continue, maybe we’ll
tour."

So, they continue to push,
heading ever forward, and as
Hildebrand suggests, “ picking up
speed like a steam locomotive.”

Steel Kiss and Laughing Wild

By Mindy Boffemmyer
The Pitt News

In the vein of selecting
disturbing,
contemporary plays to force the
audience into. thinking, City
Theatre presents Steel Kiss, the
story of four teenage boys whose
hom,ophobia leads them to kill a
gay man for the thrill of it.

This play is particularly
disturbing. Focusing as it does on

‘ a hate crime, it is full of explicit
physical and verbal violence.

Throughout the play we are
exposed to glimpses of male
societal programming —— the

Four actors (Scott House, Paul
Kaup, John Tully and Michael
Waller) alternate in all of these
rolesfwith words such as “the
victim” or “the coach” ﬂashing on
a screen to differentiate the
characters.

The preacher explains the
“dangers” involved in tolerating
homosexuality, which he
describes as a filthy blob. Mom
constantly compares her son to
the husband that abandoned her.
And periodically the boys are
visited by the spirit of the gay
man whom they killed.

rapid segments, making the
experience all
disturbing. As the play progresses,
the confusion and isolation being
thrust upon the boys is evident
and easily felt.

it left this production feeling
very relieved to have been subject
to warped female, rather than
warped male, messages as I was
growing up. Steel Kiss shows the
effects of refusing an individual
an outlet for his emotions in the
way that we as a society promote
the bottling of emotions in men.

Misogyny and homophobia run
rampant through the minds of
these boys. They have no concept
of either women or gays but have
an unavoidable curiosity about
both.

The hypermasculine,
womanizing leader of the group
confesses to the audience that he
hates gays because of his own
interest in other men.

Eventually they are drinking in ‘I ~
_ the local park and are disgusted

by the gays who have come there
to cruise.

It is apparent, however, at this
point that theseboys are enraged
by far more than gays. They are
emotionally volatile and reinforce
erratic, ignorant, frustrated
behavior in one another.

They attack and brutalize a gay
man, finally kicking him to death.

Art outside the mainstream at

I By Monica Novak

staff Writer

As an alternative to the fake
atmosphere and stuffy attitudes
that have pervaded the Pittsburgh
art scene, The Turmoil Room was
born.

The Turmoil Room was the
brainchild of Wilhelm Hartman.
Two years ago, he and his
roommate, Kelton Fleming, began
publishing The Membrane
Envelope, a bi-monthly
compilation of artwork and
poems’ by various artists from
across the country.

Living in and working out of
the gallery at 704 S. Trenton Ave.,
they eventually began to allow
artists to “express themselves” in
their space.

Fleming maintains that The
Turmoil Room has an “open-
door policy.”

“Anyone can perform here as
long as they areserious about
what they do,” says the 24—year—
old screen printer and graphic
designer who graduated from the
Pittsburgh Art Institute. “The space
is for the community—— for people
to work together and share ideas.”

Lisa Suck Dog, a group of 85
people, performed an erotic
version of the Adam and Eve
scenario.

Seemen, a group from Austin,
T ex., performs shows about sex,
love, discrimination, racial
prejudice and AIDS, with drums
and other makeshift percussion
instruments such as sheet metal

and trash cans, while
incorporating a variety of noises.

Arcane Device is known for its
“noise music,” feedback which is
set in different tones.

The Scratch Poets provide a
bizarre twist to rap music by
meshing poetry, artwork and
“scratching.” F

Ian Crofts displayed some
shocking drawings of conversing
body parts.

The Turmoil Room is as diverse
as the art that is displayed and
performed there. “It has been
referred to as a surrealistic art
gallery, but one day it might be
an iinderground gallery. One day
it might be an expressionistic
gallery; one day it might just be a
space,” says Fleming.

Clifton and Causley honored at 25th International Poetry Forum

By Lisa Oshop
Stqﬁ‘ Wmer

Calling poetry the natural enemy of
hypocrisy, the virtues of authenticity and
veracity were credited to two worthy
poets at this year’s Charity Randall Citation
Award ceremony, held last night on the
25th anniversary of the International Poetry

Forum.

Lucille Clifton and Charles Causley were
each presented with a bronze plaque and
a $2000 cash award by Robert Randall,

brother of Charity Randall, who left an
endowment to honor poets who take the
public performance of poetry as seriously
as the writing of the poem.

Clifton first read, “Cemetery: Walnut
Grove Plantation,” which expressed the
anger and bemusement she felt when she
toured a plantation. Be gging her ancestors
to tell her their names, Clifton expressed
the rage of a people whose identity was
stolen from them.

Giving voice to the dead, Clifton
expressed Chief Crazy Horse’s prescience

of his own death in “Death of Crazy
Horse.”

And commenting on “a culture that likes
everything big but its women, ” Clifton read
her manifesto, “Homage to My Hips.”

Conversely, Charles Causley mixed
remembrance with whimsy in his work.
Drawing on his childhood, he wrote about
a visit with his aunt that ended when he
witnessed the drowning of a man in a
reservoir. Fleeing to his home, he
remembered being relieved by the presence
of the relatively benign well from which

his family drew water.

Reading from his book, Second
Destinations, Causley said individuals’
destinations are made up ofso much more
than the directions that people consciously
select. In “Bridey Wilds,” Causley reminds
us that forces before and beyond
individuals’ consciousnesses shape
destinies

Although two polar opposites, both
Clifton and Causley were well received by
the audience of 450, which consisted‘ of
students, teachers and other poetry lovers.

Dude

Continued from page S-4
there's a drastic change in the
state of affairs over in Saudi Arabia
or in Iraq, it has to go over right
then,” he said. “It’s made me
realize how mu ch devotion some
issues should get.”

Paglia, who is a social work
major, has been working at WPTS
since his freshman year. “My
father’s a journalist, andl dabbled
in radio at home. We have a radio

 station at home,” he said.

“I was president of student
council my senior year of high
school, and I learned a lot [about]
delegation of authority, directing
people and teaching people,” said
Paglia, whose responsibilities

    

include watching the AP wire,
dividing the national and
international news and providing
an avenue for writing and
broadcast majors to practice their
skills.

The most rewarding part of
being a collegiate broadcast
journalist is “being aware,” said
Paglia. “There’s a lot of people

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

on campus and a lot of people in
life that really have no idea of
what’s going on. I find out things
that happen all over the world
right as they’re happening.”

Paglia wants to stay in
Pittsburgh after graduation and
work with adolescent substance
abusers and victims of domestic
violence.

I-'rontI.ine Assembly

By David Krivda
Staff Writer

With the 19903 now well under
way, industrial music has become
a movement, a high-tech
counterculture, a philosophy.
Canadian cyber—punk outfit Front
Line Assembly has emerged as
one of the movement’s most
menacing visionaries.

The industrial genre can assume
many different forms, depending
on the techno-terrorist faction
that’s grinding it out for its
constituents. But long gone are
the days when theyuppie
citizenry could gather at New

York City’s hippest venues to
hear the most obscure industrial
performance artists. Nonetheless,
misconceptions hang heavy.

' Industrial bands are
continuously under ﬁre for their
token monotony and lack of
spontaneity, instrumentation or
creativity. Amid such criticism,
however, Front Line Assembly
has been a major factor in
elevating industrial music to the
highest ranks of consciousness-
raising.

No, ,it’s not simply metal-on-
metal percussion and mindless
button-punching -- it’s political
railings supported by a furious,

yet trance-inducing dance beat.

FLA was founded in 1987 in
Vancouver, British Columbia,
when Skinny Puppy dissident Bill
Leeb joined Michael Balch to
pursue their own distinct hard-
driving electro-dance. After
several indie EPS, the band’s first
full-length venture, Corrosion,
was released in the states on
Chicago’s Wax Trax! Records in
1988. ‘

A successful mini LP titled
Disorder soon followed, but it
was FLA’s critically acclaimed
concept album Gasbed Senses
and Crossﬁre that established it
as a bona fide member of the
new industrial scene.

Gasbedsignified a turning point
for the Front Line Assembly. While
it was gaining wide-range access
to dance floors worldwide with
such powerful singles as “No
Limit” and “Digital Tension

Dementia,” the band was als.<i3_,‘
concerning itself more and more ‘

with the effects of empty political
rhetoric on the socialization
process. Leeb screamed slogan-
style lyrics such as “Freedom is a
luxury/a self—induced hostility”
as the LP found its way into
England’s prestigious New Music
Express’ ‘Must Buy List.”
However, Gasbed also proved
to be Ba1ch’s swan song, and FLA
was left splintered until Leeb
recruited cyber—punk compatriot
Rhys Fulber. The duo’s newest
information-distortion manifesto,

Caustic Grip, picks up right where .

Gasbed Senses and Crossﬁre left
off. The new material again
focuses on hatred toward the
fascist homogenization of society
produced by political rhetoric and
media slogans.

FLA’s music rejects the bright
and prosperous outlook preached
by politicians. Leeb’s1
denouncements are clear; he
prophetically growls on Forge,
“You're selling it without remorse/
the better days are far worse 

Front Line Assembly’s
philosophy also serves as the
cornerstone for the band’s
powerful live show, where
thunderbolts of anti-political
soapbox rhetoric are released
upon thrashing audiences.The
crowd is treated to doses of ultra-
violence via a large screen
looming behind the Mohawked
Leeb — a multi—media spectacle.

The FLA’s heavy dance beats
work the audience into a near
frenzy, with layers of fierce
percussion driving home the
band’s threats.

Since the genre's ﬂedgling
stages, its definitive, subversive
sound has been hailed by
industrial zealots as “what punk
could have been if it only had the
technology.” Front Line
Assembly’s prolific political ax-
grinding and angry stage assault
have indeed carried on, the
anarchist traditions established
by the punk invasion, but its
music appears to be far more
focused and literate to end up as
merely a footnote in the pages of
modern music.

(Wax Trax! recording artist
Front Line Assembly will perform
an all-ages show tonight at 81). m.

Local playwright discusses Bricklayers

By Michelle Kleinsak
Staff Writer

The St. Lorenzo Club, once the
center of a large immigrant Italian
community, stands at the south
end of Bouquet Street. Every year
a procession honoring the saint
winds through the narrow, hilly
streets of Oakland.

With each passing year, both
the parade and the community
have grown smaller. This dying
community provided most of the
subject matter for Elvira DiPaolo’s
nostalgic play, Bricklayers.

“The play comes directly from
my past and my own experiences.
I’m sure I wouldn’t have been
able to write this play if I hadn’t
been born here,” she says.

Because the play deals with
Old World values, DiPaolo is
constantly amazed at the amount
of attention Bricklayers is

‘getting. She says, “I never thought

anybody outside of Oakland
would even care about these
characters.” .

The play recently had a
successful run at the Yale
Repertory Winterfest, which is
one of the most prestigious forums
for new playwrights in the
country. DiPaolo’s break came
when Bricklayers was chosen to
go to the Eugene O’Neill
Conference. It was there that
DiPaolo saw the play “on its
feet,” with experienced actors

L bringing the script to life.

Because many artistic directors
go to the O’Neil1 Conference to
check out what’s new, Lloyd

T Richards, the internationally

known director of Yale Repertory

Theater, saw the play and liked’

what he saw. From there,
Bricklayers traveled to Yale,
where it met with enthusiastic
full houses and two post-show
discussions.

«r Turmoil —

Continued from page S-3

Whatever it might be, Fleming 1

insists it will never become part
of the mainstream art scene of

Pittsburgh, which is why the '

events that take place in The
Turmoil Room are promoted by
word of mouth.

Fleming feels the Pittsburgh art
scene has become “extremely
saturated” with people who’ just
want to be seen among the circles.
‘‘I find myself wandering around
at [art] shows, looking not so
much at the art, but at the people,”
says a disappointed Fleming.

Yet, Fleming gives Pittsburgh
credit for trying to become a
thriving art center. “When you
think of Pittsburgh, you generally
don’t think of art as you do with
New York or Los Angeles.
Pittsburgh is striving to establish
a name for itself. It is at the
bottom of the pit trying to get
out,” he says.

Fleming mentions an upcoming
show to be held on Feb. 23, but
refuses to reveal what’s in store.
He said, “If ‘they’re interested
enough, they’ll come down to
see for themselves.”

The gallery’s regular hours are
Wednesday, Thursday and
Saturday, 7 p.m. to 10 p.m., and
Sunday,‘1 p.m. to 5 p.m.

The play chronicles the lives of
three brothers who make their
living in the bricklaying business.
The oldest brother was born in
Italy and raised in an Old World
environment. The middle brother
is the most Americanized, and
the youngest is mentally slow
due to an illness he had as a child.

When the youngest brother
wishes to marry an old—fashioned
girl ‘named Marina, they must
abide by traditional rules of
courtship that seem archaic when
compared to the dating practices
of today. For instance, an uncle
accompanies them on their first

date because a family member V

must always be present on a
date.

Despite the deep-seated
tradition that lends Bricklayers its
charm, most of the conflict comes

MURPHY’S

when the characters are forced
to break out of their little village
and confront reality. ‘

The real world is represented
by Pitt. DiPaolo says, “Pitt is like
a character in the play. As the
university grows, families are
pushed out.” The expansion of
the university and the need for
student housing has had a
devastating effect on the once
family—oriented South Oakland
area. As art often imitates life, at
the end of the play the oldest
brother, who is getting up in
years, is forced to leave the
bricklaying business and take a
job working for Pitt.

DiPaolo says, “All of the
characters involved realize they
are eventually going to have -to
leave the front yard and go out
into the world.”

Play

Continued from page 5-7

The assimilation of
immigrant Italians into
American society is a main
theme in the play. “What made
them special is their Italian
culture; when you take that
away, they’re‘ like everybody
else,” DiPaolo says.

DiPaolo, who completed
her undergraduate degree at
Pitt in English writing, did
most of the work on her play
while attending Carnegie
Mel1On’s rigorous graduate
program in playwriting. She
works as public-relations
director for Pittsburgh Public
Theater, and she is currently
working on another play.
