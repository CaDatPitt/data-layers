Detre and Holland clash over tenure policy

\

Byjulie Sabol
and Matt Groff
The Pitt News

Pitt Health Sciences Senior Vice Chancellor
Thomas Detre called remarks that James
Holland said last week, “a verbal equivalent
of lynching,” at the Senate Council meeting
yesterday. .

“I do not believe [Holland] should feel
good about it —- but he obviously does,”
Detre said. “He wants to arouse emotions. He
succeeded. If he wanted to conduct himself
as a colleague — he failed.”

Holland, who serves as president of the
Faculty Assembly and Senate Council, spoke

at last week’s Faculty Assembly meeting
about the unfairness of the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center’s treatment of Dr.
Norman Wolmark, who was asked to resign
as chief of surgery as a result of a merger
between UPMC and Montefiore Hospital.
Holland said Wolmark’s lab space was taken
away and his staff was “scared out, bought
outland] pushed out” by UPMC. Holland said
he did not mention Detre’s name.

“I absolutely feel I was right in discussing
this at [Faculty] _Assembly  it had progressed
to a very late point in [Wolrnark’s] experience
here.” Wolmark had been pressed and the
research money available to him was

decreased. He “effectively lost his abilitygto

function as chief of surgery at Montefiore,”
Holland said.

According to Detre, Holland’s statements
about UPMC were not frilly supported.

“I wonder how you would have felt had I
held up allegations of some kind about
Professor Holland or any other member of
the Senate,” Detre said to members of Senate
Council. “May I ask you, are there any conse-

._ quences when the president of the Senate

rnisbehaves  and entertains his crowd with
unsupported allegations?”
Holland said he attempted to verify
Wolmark’s accusations.

Chris Palmierlo/l Pitt News

A report, critical of the
Pitt administrations han-
dling of two tenure cases
in the past year, drew fire
from Interim Provost
Mark Nordenberg at yes-
terday's Senate Council
meeting.

“This document ldis-
tributed by the Tenure
and Academic Freedom
Committee] is destructive
of reputations in that it is
grossly unfair,” Norden-
berg said. _

“I think it ought to be
disowned by this group,”
he said.

Submitted by English
professor Richard Tobias
and professor of social
work, Barbara Shore of
TAFC, the report asked
that evidence of viola-
tions in the tenure
process be given “objec-
tive and full considera

“There is no penalty for
misapplying the process-

said. “Policies must be
followed.” .

report, the provost

Organization tried to shed some
light on the subject of rape Friday
with its information table in the
lower level of the Willam Pitt
Union.

“Our table spoke to men iust as
much as it spoke to women.

Women need to be aware. But
men are the ones that have to
stop it.,Women will no longer be
victims of physical oppression -
or any kind,” CWO co-president
Shira Hassan said.

‘it is very important to educate
[people] about rape, especially
on a college campus,” said Pam
Bennett. a member of the safety
commitee for CWO.

According to Hassan, one in
four women are raped on college
campuses, as compared to one
in eight in society.

Of all rapes, 67 percent of the
attackers know their victims
while only 33 percent of the
attackers‘ are complete strangers,

according to Pittsburgh Action

Against Rape statistics.
Many rape victims never report

‘the crime to the police. Only 55

percent of rapes by strangers are
reported to the police and only 2
percent of family or date rapes
are reported, according to the
Pennsylvania Coalition Against
Rape.

“Eighty-four percent of rape
survivors do not report rape to
the police. Twelve percent report

Minority retention could be improved, administrators say

By Frank Porco
Staff‘ Writer

In 1991 the Black Action Society held a
news conference in which they chastised
Pitt for its poor retention rate of minority
students.

According to Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs William Harmon, Pitt has
had African-American presence on cam-
pus and has served as a model for other

universities.

“There are areas we need to improve,
however,” he said.

Harmon said the biggest improvement
Pitt must make in minority retention on
campus is recruiting quality minority stu-
dents, so that the students will be
respected by their peers.  V

“There is a move within the university
to coordinate academic support services
for minority students,” Harmon said.

“We then must identify those services
available to minority students so they

can meettheir educational goals," he
said.

“Retention is more than satisfying aca-
demic requirements so students can
attend the university. You have to keep
in view the environment in which stu-
dents live, study and play.”

Dr. Nancy Washington, assistant to
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor, negates
pessimism on campus involving campus
retention.”

“We really don’t take the time to rec-

ognize the small victories in the strug-
gle,” Washington said.

“But we are not enough along. We are
not doing enough until we retain as
many minority students as white stu-
dents.”

A According to Harmon, the administra-
tion needs to raise several ‘questions to
themselves as well as the university com-
munity.

-Is this an environment of inclusion

See Retention, page 3

The socially aggressive person often
afxempts to meet his or her personal goals at
the expense of others. The socially
unassertive person, on the other hand, is so
fearful of intruding on others that they sacri-
fice many personal goals. A more successful
interactional strategy is social assertiveness,
i.e., self—expressive, honest, firm and direct
behavior that is also respectful of the rights
of others. ‘

If you want to become more assertive,
you can accomplish this by becoming more
observant, more experimental and more
willing to practice new ways of behaving.
To get started you might keep a daily diary
and record incidents in which you have
acted assertively or unassertively. A review
of your diary should help you to under-
stand whether the problem is situational or
more pervasive. A

If your problem is confined to a few types
of situations such as having difficulty
expressing your feelings when close friends
take advantage of you, then you are proba-
bly capable of working out a self-help pro-

gram that may lead to rapid improvement.
Since building your confidence through
successful accomplishments is important, it
would be best if you started with less diffi-
cult tasks involving healthy assertive behav-
ior and then move on to more difficult
tasks. Practice visualizing yourself acting
appropriately in the problem situation. This

Coping on Campus with
Dr. Robert Gallagher

is a very powerful technique because it
allows you to practice while not in the
threatening situation. Imagine yourself, for
example,. saying in a firm, clear and honest
voice, a _statement such _as “It upsets me
when you borrow my things and don’t
return them,” or even a positive assertion
such as, “I really appreciate your kindness
to me.”

THE PI'IT NEWS, Tuesday, November 16, 1993

Counseling Center advises how to be assertive

When you feel comfortable visualizing
yourself acting assertively, ask a friend to
role-play that situation with you. After a few
practice sessions you should be able to
tackle the actual situation. When you make
progress, praise yourself and then go to
work on another of your unassertive habits.
It’s also important to track your progress in
your diary.

If your problem is severe, you might want
to consult a counselor or participate in an
assertiveness training group. There are also
books such as Your Perfect Right, and

Asserting Yourself available in Pitt’s Career

Library (534 WPU), at other university
libraries and the Pitt Book Center.

The ability to express your feelings, speak
up for your rights and choose how you will
act is a skill that can be learned.
Improvement in this area is rewarded by
improved se1f—esteem, self-confidence and
better interpersonal relationships. If you
have a problem in this area, you owe it to
yourself to start soon on this self—irnprove-
ment project.

T wenty-seven pass up New York
Marathon for 743 Cathedral steps

By Krista J. Haag
For The Pitt News '

Twenty-seven people, rang-
ing from students to middle-
aged fathers, paced around the
ground floor of the cathedral,
stretching their legs while
counting down theminutes
until they would begin their
journey up the 37 Cathedral of
Learning ﬂoors —— 743 steps.

Twenty—two males and 5
females raced in five or six per-
son heats at yesterday’s fifth-
annual Cathedral Climb, orga-
nized by Dan Fry of the Pitt
Program Council.

Student participant John
Teisher said he felt very uneasy
about the event. .

“I am _very excited, but I’m
nervous because I don’t know
what to expect,” he said.

Ellen Warwick, the sister of
participant Christina Wolfgang,
said she promised her younger
sister lunch at the “O” if she

made it to the top. Wolfgang
said she had spent a lot of time
practicing and was looking for-
ward to it. P
“You’ve got to have a lot of
guts to do this,” Warwick said.
“I really want to go to the top
and see her when she ﬁnishes!”
Helen Perilloux who finished
first with a time of 6 minutes
and 30 seconds, and her friend
Carolyn Myers, who finished

right behind» her at second‘
'place, 7 minutes and 7 seconds,

said they were feeling quite
ready to take on the stairs.
At the finish line on the 36th

. floor, family members and

friends waited anxiously at the
stairwell to see who had the
best time, while a few para-

medics watched 'on to make‘

sure everyone was healthy. The
stair-clirnbers sipped water, ate
peeled oranges and received
their t—shirts once they made it
to the top ﬂoor.

Casey Williams,"a dental stu-

dent_ at Pitt, won by finishing
first with the best time of an
even 4 minutes. Williams, who

, was representing the new

Panther Cycling Club on cam-
pus, said he was very happy
with his time, but was not sure
if he would be back next year.
due to graduation.

“I really enjoyed today’s race,”
Williams said. “It was the first
time I’ve ever done it,- though I
did practice for it today.”

_ Forty—year-old Bill Kanarek
finished the Cathedral Climb
second to Williams with a time
of 4:07. Kanarek said he had
been ~ practicing every
Wednesday night for the event
and had participated in it the
past four years, his best overall
timevbeing 3:57. —

No one experienced any
health problems and everyone
who started on the ground ﬂoor
made it to the 36th. The top
three males and females
received medals after the race.

it within 24 hours and 4 percent
report it after 24 hours have
passed. This is pathetic,” Hassan
said.

“People don’t want to address

.the issue [of rape]. With more
information about it, people
become more aware,” Pitt senior
Jen Kinchen said.’

In a report from the National
Victims Center, 97 percent of
rape service agencies believe
that expanded education as well
as victim’s conﬁdentiality in the

media would make women
more likely to report the crime.
The study also goes on to
report that 1.3 women are raped
every minute, totaling up to
683,000 a year. Of these rapes,
32.3 percent of them are
between the ages of 11 to 17.
The second largestage group is
11 years old‘ and ‘younger, the
third largest group being 18 to 24
years old. CWO is trying to help
educate the community by run-
ning a series of safety clips
before movies offered by the Pitt

Program Council.

In addition to giving out infor-
mation, the table ‘offered infor-
mation of a self—defense class for

women which will run on Nov. _
” 13 and 20 as well as Dec. 4 and

11 through PAAR. The rape
information tables are set up by,
CWO one to two times. avmonth,

inthe lower level of the Union" to ‘

help those who have been raped
or those who want to help some-
one who has been raped.

“Rape is not about victims, it’s
about survivors,” said Hassan.

_ -Is there action and
progress for minority stu-
dents on campus? ’

“The faculty, students and
administration need to work
together,” Harmon said. “We
have begun to face and need
to do a better job of dealing
with the quality of life on
campus for minority stu-
dents.”

According to a Glamour
magazine study which
interviewed black students
and surveyed 1,000
top schools, “the most wel-
come schools are .not
surprisingly, predominantly
African-American colleges
like Howard University
and Spelman College,
as well as select urban uni-

versities like the University
of Pittsburgh, which
has lower-than—average
African—American dropout
numbers.”

Washington said Pitt is
coming together on many
efforts to improve retention
of minority students.

“The chancellor has made
more scholarships available
to minority st_udents,”
she said. “Groups such as
the BAS help make a won-
derful environment for
underrepresented minority
students.” ’

Although Pitt needs to
take more action,
Washington also puts
responsibilities on the shoul-
ders of the students.

“Retention involves being

conﬁdent, and reaching suc- A

cess when they get here,”
she said. “There are very few
people who cannot succeed
in four years of college.”

charges against the university.

The report stated “university
administrators violated
[the Faculty Handbooks confi-
dentialityl policy” when evi-
dence for Hoke’s appeal was
presented to the provost’s
office. T

Nordenberg said that Donald
Henderson, who was provost
when the incident occured,
treated the case with conﬁden-
tiality.

“None of the documents were
shared with anyone who did

 

mic tenure. “They do not in
any way begin to capture the
situations that were brought
before [former] Provost
Henderson.”

The report also asserted
that Pitt was ‘‘well out of the
recommended time limitations,”
when it terminated a faculty
member last November for
non-productivity and disrup-
.tion.

“I don't pretend to have all of
the answers about the case  ”
Nordenberg said.

not have a direct role to play in

Nordenberg said. “To present

and lost his authority as the chief
of surgery at Montefrore.
“The accusations I made  are

very well-founded,” Holland
said. “Squeezed and squeezed

retained a lawyer for purposes of
seeing what could be done,”
Holland said. I

According to Holland, the
lawyer told Wolrnark he had a
case, but it would cost more to
prosecute than it was worth.

Holland also talked about a
proposed agreement of separa-
tion, which Wolmark! received in
October. If signed, Wolmark
would have agreed to give up
tenure and withdraw his name to’

Presidential Voting Guide

After examining the platforms and interviewing the_

candidates, The Pitt News has selected the candidate
who is the most qualified to be the Student
Government Board president for the next year. The
endorsement for the 1993 Student Government Board
presidential election goes to Tara Munkatchy. V
Munkatchy’s past performance shows that she has

accomplished tangible projects. She has a proven~

record, evidenced by her past actions as a member of
SGB, during which she created a scholarship guide for
students. Although the booklet could have been more
comprehensive, it does show that she follows through
on her projects. Because this was part of her campaign
to become a board member, it shows a pattern of kept
promises. She also organized a walk for Panther Pride
to benefit charity. According to Munkatchy, the ’ project
raised’ $274.80. This was also a step toward combating

' - student apathy, which all candidates acknowledge as a

problem.

1 Munkatchy is the best candidate to deal with both the
students and the administration. This year she served as
a member of the University Senate Council. Because
the SGB president must serve as a liaison between the
students and administration, it is important to have a

president who has experience working with both sides.

Because of her dedication, not only will Munkatchy be
able to accomplish her goals, but she will also be
accessible to _the students. She will be available and

A ‘ﬂexible enough to deal with student concerns personal-
. ly. Munkatchy plans to continue working for women’s

concerns. Most specifically, she «wants to work more
toward creating a women’s; studies major. She has

. worked onr-tl1:is*~ipro‘ject*with Susan Hanson of Pitt’s

Women’s Studies Department. Hanson was quoted as
saying, “with the budget and class constraints, you run
into many problems. But I know Tara has been
researching the possibilities.’’ ~

Munkatchy also has plans to improve the quality of
the Student Health Service. "She wants to make medical
information more accessible tostudents. She also plans

»-to examine the use of space by the Student Health

Service. In addition, she plans to address all of the
safety concerns, which were raised throughout the
campaign, by “working closely with our public safety

committee.”

Her past record shows that she .can be counted on to
work toward the goals she set forth in her campaign.
Her accessibility and work with the Pitt faculty show
her ability to coordinate on all the levels she would
have to work on as president; '

Because of her experience, motivation and concrete
plans, The Pitt News endorses Tara Munkatchy for the
1993 Student Government Board presidential election.

Bill for gender equity subversive

The ultra-liberals in the Senate
have once again reared their
ugly heads by writing the “gen—
der equity” education bills
which attack “sexual harass-
ment” in our nation’s schools
and stress the need to promote
“political correctness” in our
classrooms. ' ' .

The “gender equity” educa-
tion bills are comprise of nine
parts and the clear agenda is to
shape the minds of our chil-

dren to fit the liberal mold. The

first and second bills call for an
office of gender equity to be
set up in the Department of
Education. Under these bills,
enforcing the liberal “political
correctness” policies in our
classrooms would be mandato-
.ry.

What the liberals really mean
by this is that U.S. history
would be rewritten to conform
to their political agenda by
demonizing white males and
blaming them for all of the
atrocities that have ever befall-
en the world. While our
schools’ courses should include
the contributions made to our
country by women and minori-
ties. this should be done by
presenting historical facts, not
liberal-induced lies and propa-
ganda. A _

Another “gender equity" bill
states that feminist women
should be recruited to teach
math and science because
women and minorities are sup-
posedly at a disadvantage from
the “unfair” prejudices of white
male teachers. If this is the
case, how do the liberals
explain the undeniable fact that
Asian-American girls routinely
outscore white boys in stan-
dardized science and math
tests. It is not nature that
breeds this success; it is nur-
Lure.

Most Asian-American chil-
dren are brought up in two-
parent families that stress hard
work and responsibility, not
whining. and blaming others for
their own failures.

If some people cannot suc-

ceed in fair competition the lib-
erals want to bring everyone
down to their level. They
attempt to make it a race or
gender issue when in reality it
clearly is not. Liberals never
stop to think that the problem
is with the individuals and not
our system.

Bill. number four is aimed at-
. dropout prevention for preg-

nant teens. While I think that
nearly everyone would agree
that it is good that teens who
become pregnant stay in

, Tony ,
Dickensheets

school, I’m troubled by the fact
that this bill doesn’t mention
anything about trying to dis-
courage children from having
sex in the first place. The statis-
tics prove just how serious teen
pregnancy is in the U.S. and
the consequences of ignoring it
(as the liberals do).

Eighty—five percent of chil-
dren who grow up with unwed
mothers live below the poverty
level; only 2 percent of teenage
mothers go on to higher educa-
tion; the U.S. leads the world in
teen pregnancies with over one
million per year; the illegitima-
cy ratio in the U.S. is almost 25
percent of all births. These hor-
rifying statistics are not caused
by race and gender inequality
as the liberals preach, but by
an unending cycle of broken,
one-parent families and people
that aren’t responsible enough
to care for their children. Our
government is also to blame for

encouraging this behavior by ,

giving endless amounts of wel-
fare to people who continue to
have children and/or refuse to
work.

Bills five and six want to end
all “sexual harassment” in
schools and brainwash children
into believing the nonsense
that there is no difference

between boys and girls. It’s
impossible to say what “harass-
ment” is anymore because we
now have five—year olds crying
that they were “sexually
harassed” and grown women
that only need to make accusa-
tions and do not have to pro-
vide proof, according to our
Supreme Court.

All of this nonsense is
demeaning to the women who
are truly sexually harassed or
raped.

The u1tra—feminists should
come to grips with the fact that
God made men and women
different and deal with it.
Instead they are encouraging
the development of school-
based services that would
encourage children to sexually
experiment with “alternative
lifestyles” and require children
to read books like “Heather
Has Two Mommies,” while vir-
tually eliminating Judeo-
Christian values from our class-
rooms.

Bills seven, eight and nine
are a mixture of liberal double-
speak which challenges
parental authority by an all-
inclusive “child abuse” clause.

‘Parents would not be allowed

to spank or Verbally Correct
their children.

This is the opposite of what
we need in a nation that
already doesn’t teach our chil-
dren (or criminals) discipline.
responsibility and right from
wrong.

This "gender equity" act is
clearly one of the most danger-
ous, subversive pieces of legis-
lation to ever be considered in
the history of this country.

Whatever happened to thei

days when people in America
became successful through
hard work and merit?

Success now comes through
crying race or gender discrimi-
nation and going to court. It
doesn’t bode well for the future
of America.

Pitt faces mirror image this Saturday at Temple

By Cory Walborn
Staff Writer

,A Tale of Two Cities.
A Tale of Two Football-
Programs.

A sad story Dicken_s would .

have probably passed on — too
messy. ‘

A tale, however, that John
Majors and Ron Dickerson can’t
pass on. For both head coaches

this story is a real-lifegdrama that ‘

might allow them to-‘write their
own happy ending — they
hope.

Yes, that is the perplexing sit-
uation in Pittsburgh and
Philadelphia —- at Pitt and at

Temple in 1993. They are the _ ’

worst two teams in the Big East
Conference and their rebuilding
woes are just beginning.

“The only way to stay off the
bottom of the conference is
Saturday,” Majors said at yester-
day’s weekly press outing when
describing Pitt’s season finale
against Temple.

“I don’t think there is a
favorite in this game,” Majors
jokingly added. 1

Actually there is, Pitt by one-
half a point.

But make no mistake, on

paper these teams are even.

Pitt (2-8 overall, 1-5 in confer-
ence) or Temple (1-9, 0-6) are
dead last in 12 of the 18 Big East
Conference statistical cate-
gories. It only gets worse.

Temple has allowed more"

points in every quarter than it
has scored combined all season.
But Temple, or rather
Dickerson, who after losing
nine straight since its season-
opening victory at Eastern
Michigan has remained surpris-
ingly optimistic. . ‘
“Obviously it’s disheartening
to come out of games with
scores like we have,” Dickerson
said. _
“But on Sunday when we
watch films, we emphasize the
positive. That is what is keeping

‘ us aﬂoat right now.”

Something has to. With con-
secutive losses of 58-0, 66-14
and 62-0, Temple’s morale ship
should be sinking, but it’s not.

“We are realistic and honest
with the kids about the situa-
tion,” Dickerson said of
Temple’s dismal state. “But we
keep smiles on because there is
light at the end of the tunnel.”

And that light starts with
Dickerson.

An assistant coach since 1972,
Dickerson coached at such pro-
grams as Kansas State,
Louisville, Colorado and

Clemson. He also is familiar

with the Keystone State, coach-
ing at Penn State and Pitt.

Finally after 20 years of being
an assistant, Dickerson got _the
head man job at Temple in
December —— a job that quite
possibly is even more difficult
than the one Majors took here at

‘ Pitt. The reason: Temple

had no past football tradition

like Pitt and Dickerson does not:

have the legendary status of
Majors. .

But that has not changed
Dickerson’s stance, like Majors’
stance, on how to build a com’-
petitive team.

“Recruits know what direction
we are heading,” Dickerson
said. -

“Our recruiting is not a hook,
it is the truth. Recruits have an
opportunity to come and play,
and play early. ‘

“There has also been talk
about facilities, -but not in—depth
talk,” Dickerson said.
“Obviously we would like to
play at a college—type stadium
but we will wait and see what

the future holds.” .

What the future holds for Pitt
is also questionable. But there
are more encouraging signs. ,

“I am feeling very positive
about [Pitt’s] new facilities,”
Majors said after his meeting
with a Pittsburgh architectural

' group a few weeks ago.

But the heart of the rebuild-
ing—Pitt process lies exactly
where Dickerson puts T emple’s
hopes —' recruiting.

“We need to recruit at every
position” has been the staple
quote of Majors since the sea-
son began.

Saturday’s game with Temple
might be the best recruiting
venture Pitt has conducted all
year.

“My two favorite times to win
a game is before an open date
and at the end of the season,”
Majors said. “The win lasts
longer.

“It also makes Christmas bet-
ter, Thanksgiving better. and
more importantly, recruiting
better,” Majors said. “But we’ll
hit’ the [recruiting] road anyway
if we lose.”

You bet Dickerson and
Temple will do the same.

The tale continues.

Taking a glance into the bleachers at Golden Mile Ice
Center for the ‘start of the Pitt hockey club’s showdown —
with Penn State last Saturday, one may have experi— 
:enced a little situational confusion. ,

Upon viewing the generous platoon of screaming, 
sign-waving Penn’State fans giving their team a loud .
ovation when it took the ice, it seemed as if this game
were being played closer to State College rather than 20
minutes from the Pitt campus.

For‘ all their efforts,-. however, the Penn State fans
failed to impress one important group of individuals —
the Panthers — whose 12-5 victory made the ride back 
to Happy Valley a lot longer for the Icers and their con- -' g

“No excuses  we really got our [butts] kicked,” Icers '
head coach Vinnie Scalamogna said. “Pitt has a lot of
depth, a lot of strength and a lot of good talent. They
are a very well-coached’ team. '

“Hockey is a very inconsistent game though. One day

teams meet and there can be a, _whole different out- _ ,

Pitt’s No. 1 scoring line consisting of rookie center 
Bill Elliott and forwards Tony Trovato and Matt White
paid big-time dividendsas all three Panthers had their
best single"-game scoring output of the season.

Elliott, who has not slowed down since the Panthers’
second game of the season, led all scorers with his sec-
ond hat trick of the season, to go along with three
assists for a career—high six points.

Trovato, ‘moving from defense to right wing" in order to add
speed to the front line, assisted on three goals and scored two

reel on Saturday with another fantastic playmaking exhibition,
including an incredible Lemieux-esque goal, en route to four
points (one goal, three assists). —

“Matt White, I thought, worked beautiful on the boards

tonight,” Ochs said.

' The Pitt News I

_ College basketball does not
have as many top-heavy teams
this year compared to years
gone by. After the unanimous
No.‘ 1 choice North Carolina,
parity dominates the NCAA
scene.

As Dick Vitale’s illegitimate
children, we assessed the hoop
field and compiled The Pitt
News top 25.

1) North Carolina

The defending NCAA champs
are again the class of college
basketball. Eric Montross is the
best center in the college ranks
and is the top pick in the ‘94
NBA draft if Glenn Robinson
doesn’t come out early. Brian
Reese should sport a more com-
plete game this year at small
forward. Final Four MVP
Donald Williams will singe a
few more nets and point guard
Derrick Phelps is a ‘90s version
of Phil Ford. ‘

The Tar Heels’ only signifi-
cant loss from last year was
George Lynch who graduated to
the NBA. Carolina replaced him
by assembling the nation’s top
recruiting class. Look for rookie

Jerry Stackhouse to jump into
Lynch’s vacated starting spot.
The bench includes holdovers
(and Pittsburgh natives) Dante
Calabria and Kevin Salvadori as
well as talented rookies
Rasheed Wallace and Jeff
Mclnnis. The only foreseeable
problem is that Carolina has too
many high school.All-Americans

on the same team, if that is actu-'

ally possible.

2) Arkansas

The Hogs. are in the house in
‘93. Nolan Richardson landed
possibly the best recruit of the
class with 6’11” Darnell
Robinson. He is a rare big man
who can do it all. That will
allow Corliss Williamson to
slide to power forward and
super swingman Scotty

Thurman to continue to launch

the threes (who broke Todd
Day’s three-point record in one
season). With tremendous ath-
letes like Corey Beck and Clint
McDaniel in the backcourt,
Richardson will be pressing his
way to a national champi-
onship.

3) Kentucky

Roderick Rhodes, Jared
Prickett and dunking-machine
newcomer Walter McCarty will

be the highlights of the
Kentucky attack. The treys
won’t belflying from every
direction like they once did, but
that doesn’t mean Tony Delk
and pint-sized Travis Ford won’t
be nailing their fair share.
Rodney Dent and Andre “I have
Laettner’s footprint on my jer-
sey” Riddick will rotate duties in
the pivot. Coach Rick Pitino will
make another run at the Final
Four with this group.

4) Michigan

Ann Arbor only wept for a
couple of weeks after Chris
Webber committed to the NBA
because they still have the Fab
Four. Webber’s vacancy will
open the door for the multi-tal-
ented Juwan Howard in the
paint. With the versatility in
their backcourt — 6’8” Jalen
Rose, 66” Ray Jackson and 6’5”
Jimmy King — expect to see the
same showtime highlights of
last season. I

5) Louisville

The fortunes of the Cardinals
rest not on Metro conference
player of the year Clifford

_ Rozier or the NCAA’s third most

accurate three-point shooter
Dwayne Morton, but on rookie
point guard DeJuan Wheat.

6) California

Jason Kidd to Lamond Murray
is possibly the best one—two
combination in the country.

. Kidd is looking to lead Cal to its

first Final Four birth since 1960
and with the addition of rookie-
prize recruit Michael Stewart in
the middle he might be up to
the task. K.J. Roberts will
replace Kansas transfer Jerod

join rebounder Alfred Grigsby.
Haase will be missed but if Cal

8) Duke P

Silky smooth Grant Hill can
do it all. Any position besides

why he is one of the top candi-

Stacked with big men, led by
Cherokee Parks and much her-
alded recruits of 6’11” Greg
Newton and 6’9” Joey Beard,
the Blue Devils have the middle
solidified. Ironically enough,
the point guard slot is the big
question mark. Either Chris
Collins, a natural two-guard, or
rookie Jeff Capel have to step
up for them to continue their
winning tradition.

9) Georgia Tech

Coach Bobby “Should I stay
or should I go” Cremins only
uses five or six players even
when he has more at his dispos-
al. Cremins doesn’t have much
in the pivot either (Ivano
Newbill will have to do) but for-
ward James Forrest is quickly
becoming one of the country’s
top players and the Tech
perimeter game is awesome.
Travis Best, Drew Barry and
Maitice Moore make up the best
guard trio that Dick Vitale can
name in one breath. Moore will
explode on to the national
scene this year. _ '

"' Pitt has been shut out (Notre

Dame beat Pitt 44-0). This time

it was the 22nd-ranked Boston
College Eagles over Pitt, 33-0.

“I think the whole game was
really frustrating for the
offense,” Pitt quarterback John
Ryan said. , '

“To come out with no
p_oints, it got everybody
depressed. Nobody knew
what to do.”

The Boston College defense
was led by linebacker Stephen
Boyd, the leading tackler in
the Big East, who had a team-
high 10 tackles with six unas-
sisted.

“We just wanted to stop the
running game in general,”
Boyd said.

“We had a good. team»
defensive effort, and that’s
what we emphasize — team
defense.”

“We knew that we would
have to stop the run; [Curtis]

Martin is an excellent back, but
we did manage to get him
stopped,” Boston College head
coach Tom Coughlin said.

Martin, the third leading
rusher in the Big East with an
average of 107.1 yards a game,
was shut down with the rest of
the Pitt offense. He was limited
to 51 yards on 16 carries.

After. a shootout win last
week against Virginia Tech,_
48-34, the Eagles concentrated
on improving its defense.

“We felt like we gave up

. way too many points last week

so we wanted to come out and
play hard defensively this
week,” Boyd said.

Coughlin agreed with his
defensive leader.

“The defense came out of

. last week’s game giving up a
lot of yards and points, and we

knew that this week we would

have to make up for that,”.
Coughlin said.

The Panthers, however,
were not without their chances
to score.

Pitt moved the ball well in
the first quarter and had an
excellent scoring opportunity.

After a Boston Collge touch-
down made it 13-0, the Eagles
kicked off and Denorse Mosley
returned the ball to the Pitt 15-
yard line. The Panthers put
together a drive and marched
all the way to the Eagles’ 13-
yard line. On third and nine,
Ryan went to wide receiver Jay
Jones in the end zone and the
pass fell incomplete. On fourth
and nine, placekicker Steve
Kalmanides came on_ to
attempt a 30-yard ﬁeld goal.

The kick was wide left and
the Panthers offense left the
field after a 72-yard drive with

no points.

“This shutout was a confi-
dence builder for us,” Boston
College cornerback Michael
Reed said. ' C

Reed intercepted a deep
Ryan pass in the first quarter
which led to the Eagle’s sec-
ond touchdown.

Boston College will need all
the confidence it can get
because they travel to South
Bend next weekend to playthe
No. 1—ranked Notre Dame
Fighting Irish.

Pitt will look to regroup and
get its offense in gear as it
heads into its last game of the
season against the lowly
Temple Owls (1-8, 0-5 in the
Big East). T

“I think everybody wants to
end the season on the right
foot — it’s been a bad season
for everybody,” Ryan said.

Hoops

Continued from page 8
10) Indiana

Three starters are gone from
last season, but General Robert
Montgomery Knight will once
again have his team ready to
go. The thrust of the offense is
on Alan Henderson’s back —
but then again Knight never
really cared about offense any-
way. Hoosier hopefuls are still
waiting for Damon Bailey to
arrive, and this will be his year.
Speaking of arrivals, 7-foot
Richard Mandeville and all-
purpose ' scorer Sherron
Wilkerson will play immedi-
ately as freshman in Knight’s
system. '

11) Kansas _ _

With all the losses from last
year’s Final Four squad, how
can the Jayhawks remain

' ranked so high? Well, Roy

Williams always finds a way to
win and he is not exactly void
of talent — just big name tal-
ent. The problem for’Williams
right now is finding a point
guard between Calvin “Mighty
Mouse” Rayford and super
prep Jacque Vaughn. Steve
Woodberrywill emerge this

year and show why he’s.
_ deserved a starting spot all

along. Look for Kansas -to keep
Oklahoma St. fron1 the Big

' Eight title.

12) ﬂlinois

The last time Illinois was
ranked so high was when they

were the Flying Illini. The

combination of marquee man
Deon Thomas and Juco sensa-
tion Shelly Clark, they should
be set in the middle. Tom
Michael and Richard Keene
were both tops behind the
three-point stripe in the Big
Ten and Rennie Clemons, if
eligible, will run the team. This
will be the year when they
finally overcome the probation
era.

13) Virginia

If Virginia had a big man it
would be rated much higher.
As it is Virginia will probably
go with three forwards and no
center. Junior Burrough, 6’8”,
is going to have tobe the go-
to-guy and be willing to accept
that role. Cornel Parker will
continue to play his patented
spiderman D’. With apologies
to Phelps and Best, silky Cory
Alexander is the top point
guard in the ACC. Virginia
could be the fourth ACC
school bound for the Sweet 16.

14) Minnesota

The golden nucleus of the
Gophers consists of their four
returning starters. Voshon
Leonard is ranked as one of
the top two-guards in college.
Along with Leonard, Arriel
McDonald, Randy Carter and

Jason Walton will not settle for

. just an NIT Championship this

season. If all things go right,
they could sneak away with
the -Big Ten title. I

15) UCLA _

The Bruins scared the baggy
pants off the Fab Five in last
year’s NCAA Tourney with the
stellar play of Ed O’Bannon.
Just think what UCLA could
have done with two
O’Bannons on the roster. This
year, rookie sensation Charles
joins older brother Ed on the
Bruins front line to form a
lethal O’Bannon attack. Tyus
Edney and Shon -Tarver return
in the backcourt with their
combined 30.8 points per
game. Depth is a problem, but
look for Kevin Dempsey to
leave his bench-warming
duties long enough to stick a
couple threes.

16) Syracuse

Lawrence “Poetry in” Moten
is well on his way to breaking
Derrick Coleman’s school scor-
ing record. Four-year starter
Adrian Autry is back again to
run Jim Boeheim’s so-called
offense and wannabe DC John
Wallace will also be a major
contributor. Redshirt freshman
Otis, Hill will help fill Conrad
McRae’s void in the middle en
route to a hopeful Big East
title.

17) Massachusetts

Master recruiter John
Calipari has assembled an
unbelievable cast of athletes.
Lou Roe —— and his bull-like
post moves — will be the new
leader of the Minutemen and
Mike Williams will be solid at
the two-"guard spot. The key
here, however, is the newcom-
ers. Donta Bright, Tyrone
Weeks and Marcus Camby are
all big—time players. Two of the
three shouldstart from the get-
go.

18) Cincinnati

No returning starters and
they’re still in the Top 25? .
That’s saying something about
Bobby Huggins’ amazing
recruiting class. Led by 6’9”
“Mr. Everything” Dontonio
Wingﬁeld will make an irnme—
diate impact as a freshman.
Damon Flint and Darnell
Burton are also top rookie
prospects. Curtis Bostic and
Lazelle Durden are the only
returning contributors from
last year’s Elite Eight team.

19) Oklahoma St.

Bryant “Big Country” Reeves
is staking claim to All-
American status although you
wouldn’t know it to look at
him. He is reminiscent of a
Frankenstein stunt double, but
the guy gets the job done and
nobody has stopped him yet.

Rookie Chianti Roberts is get-
ting rave reviews in Cowboy
country.

20) Georgetown

Othella Harrington worked
out all summer with Patrick
Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo
and Alonzo Mourning and
should have enough post
moves in his repertoireito
leave his opponents hanging
in mid-air. Joey Brown should
run the Hoyas’ show and
pound the ball down low all
year. to Harrington. Nobody on
this team has proved they can
shot from down town yet and
that is what keeps them from
being a top ten team. The
Hoyas need to see a little more
from Duane Spencer this sea-
son. ‘ '

21) Wisconsin

The sleeper in the Big" Ten.
In only his second season, all
Stu Jackson has done is land
blue-chip freshmen 7’1”
Rashard Griffith and swingman
Jalil Roberts to go along with
his solid retumers. The story of
the Badgers is one man — All
Big Ten Selection Michael
Finley. He does it all and is
supposed to be improved. The
veteran play of point guard
Tracy Webster should make
them a major contender in the
Big Ten.

season, I think he did really
well on wing tonight," he
added. ’

The Panther defense, led by
Scott Giordano, was again a
tower of strength, forcing the
Icers to take long» shots from

I , bad angles all day. Giordano’s

physical presence around the
net kept the Icers away from
Bratkovich for much of the
night.

“Gordy played awesome,”
Ochs said.

“He was really rockin’ people. .

He .doesn’t let anyone in front of
the net, he corners well, and he
knows when to comeup on the
play. : _

“He’s not exactly Paul Coffey
on skates, but you can tell that
he has great hockey sense. You
can’t teach that," he added.

The defensive pressure,
although allowing 44 shots to
fall on Panther goaltender Dan
Bratkovich, did not allow many
quality scoring chances, with
most of the shots coming from
near the blue line. Bratkovich
saved all but three of the shots
he faced until the waning min-
utes of the game, when with
4:27 left, amelee kept Pitt short-
handed for much of the remain-
der, allowing the Icers to score
twice before all was said and
done.

Penn State netminder Craig
McGowan was not so fortunate,
however, as the Panthers knifed
their way through the Icer

defense at will, peppering him
with 50 shots.

The Panthers opened up the
scoring after just 3:55 of the first
period, when Trovato entered
the offensive zone, zigzagged
around two Icers, and ﬂipped a
shot just inside the post to the
right of McGowan, giving Pitt an
early 1-0 lead.

Defenseman Ken Anderson

_ increased the Panthers’ lead
when his knuckleball from the
right a point ' handcuffed
McGowan, slipped under his
glove and into the net for a 2-0
Panther advantage.

After Anderson’s shot went in
the net, Panthervcaptain Vic
Disanti received a four-minute
double-minor penalty for cross-
checking, giving the Icers a
‘golden opportunity which they
took no time in cashing in on.

Just 32 seconds after. the.
Anderson goal and subsequent
penalty, Icer forward Dave
Pagano hit captain Steve Vereb
-in front of the net with a perfect

pass which Vereb buried
behind Bratkovich to cut. the
Panther lead to 2-1.

The Icers made it a whole
new game just 2:33 later when
Pagano grabbed a loose puck in
front of the cage and scored to
tie it up at 2-2. From this point
on, however, the game
belonged to the Panthers.

After a goal by defenseman
Darren Stock made it 3-2,
Disanti broke the -Icers’ backs
with a goal thateven Mario

would have marvelled at.

Disanti grabbed the puck at
the left wing dot, then skated
behind the cage, perhaps look-
ing for a man breaking for the ’
net. Seeing that the front of the
net was covered, Disanti
slammed on the brakes, came
back around and slid the puck

4 between McGowan’s legs and

into the net to give the Panthers
a 4-2 lead. \

Disanti’s goal seemed to take
all the_life out of the Icers, as
the Panther defense toughened
up and held the Icers scoreless
for the remainder of the first
period and the entire second‘
period. Meanwhile, the
Panthers themselves scored
three more unanswered goals
during this time span, creating
an insurmountable 6-2 lead.
Elliott notched his third game-
winning goal of the season with
3:55 remaining in the second
frame with assistsgoing to
Trovato and White.
