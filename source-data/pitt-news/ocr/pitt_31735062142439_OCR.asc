Women Asked 9
To Help In
War Effort

Last week all University women
received letters from the War Ac-
tivities Committee urging them to
cooperate in the war effort.

Women are needed for tele-
phone messengers, first aid
crews, civilian defense workers,
draftswomen, and as aides. Al-
most ﬁve hundred girls are need-
ed for special positions, and
every girl who possibly can is
asked to train ten hours to be-
come Air Raid Wardens, Fire
Watchers, or O.C.D. messengers.

Sahirleynwhippo, C44, chairman
of the committee, stated, “Those
of us who are still in the Univer-
sity cannot do what many of the
men and women are doing, but we
all want to do something to help
in this war.”

Dr. Geise and Dr. Gray who
are heading’ the Civilian Defense
at the University, feel that soon
women will have to assume the
entire responsibility of this or-

ganization, and for that reason
they wish to lit in immediately
as many as is possible.

It is asked that all women ﬁll
out their cards at once and return
them so the committee can arrange
the courses at hours most conve1ii-
ent to the students.

1. The only all-clear signal used
in the Cathedral of Learning to in-
dicate the end of an alert is a con-
tinuous twb-minute blast of the
Cathedral sirens. No operation of
the lighting system is to be inter-
preted as an all-clear signal. No
warden will dismiss the group for
which he is responsible until the
all-clear has sounded.

2. In the interests of comfort
and protection there should be no
smoking during air-raid drills in
the Cathedral of Learning. Condi-
tions imposed by air-raid precau-
tions are such that it is impossible
to get plenty of fresh air into the
shelters. This makes smoking a
source of grave discomfort to peo-

Mr. Jacob J. Blair, asssitant pro-
fessor of economics, in a discus-

132 Cathedral, announces Hal Gon-

Initiating a new feature today,
town meeting will direct true-false
questions at the audience in the
first few minutes of the forum. In
this manner, explained Gondelman,
the people attending will have an
indication of the general thought
of the assembly. Subsequently, the
questions will ‘ be answered and
elaborated upon in the course of
Mr. Blair’s talk.

Mr. Blair has been associated
with the National Labor Rela-

view the labor situation, of the
country with its relation to the
war. Following Mr. Blair’s dis-
cussion,’ the customary question
period will be conducted enabl-

questions to the speaker.

Tomorrow Last
Day For Seniors
To Pose, For Owl

Seniors and advanced juniors
who will graduate from the 1943
summer semester may still have
their pictures taken today and to-
morrow at Gimbel’s studios for
inclusion in the 1943 yearbook.

Decision to include 1943 sum-
mer graduates was ‘made Friday
by the editorial board so that those
students could obtain their year-
book before they graduate rather
than a year later as is the case
with this summer's graduates.

Seniors who expect to be call- ‘
ed for service with the armed’
forces before they graduate may
also have ‘ their pictures taken
for inclusion with their. gradu-
ating class. A deposit of $2 is

required before a picture will be

taken at Gimbel’s studios.

A deposit may be made in the
Owl oﬂice, 803 Cathedral, at the
booth in the round ﬂoor elevator
lobby, or wit? any of the 35 Owl
senior salesmen. No pictures can
be taken after 5 o’clock tomorrow
afternoon as the Owl’s contract
with the studio expires at that
time. a

All seniors who have not yet'had
their picture taken must do so to-
day or tomorrow or their picture
will not appear in the yearbook.
This includes those who graduated
from the summer session, those
who will graduate in January or
May, and Juniors who will gradu-
ate from the 1943 summer session.

Dean Discusses

WOITICI1 ll‘! War

By MIRIAM ROSENBLOOM L

The need for trained women is
so great that sooner or later all
college women will be absorbed
in the war effort.

Such was the prediction made at
the conference on College Women
and the War, called by North-
western University, which Miss
Helen Pool Rush, dean of women,
attended.

The conference, at which nine-
ty-four colleges and universities
were represented, was called pri-
marily to discuss and formulate
a training program which will
best ﬁt college women for parti-
cipation in the nation’s war ef-
fort. Representatives of business,
industry, nursing, the WAACS,
the WAVES and the social ﬁelds
presented their points of view at
the meetings.

Those who participated in the
conference believed that women
must direct their courses towards
the best of which each is capable.
Superior work is essential because
of today's pressing demand made
upon the educated woman.

As soon as possible courses must
be pointed towards deﬁnite ends
and there is to be increased em-
phasis upon the physical sciences
—-mathematics, physics and chem-
istry in the women's curriculum.

All college courses must be di-
rected toward a single purpose.——~
that of ‘winning the war and ac-
celeration for the college coed will
soon be as important as it is for
college men.

In summing up the efforts of
the war upon college women
Miss, Bush said, “This is the
vrnost challenging and interest-
mg time ever in the history of
college women."

E and M Dances Tomorrow,

fraternity, had been under prel-
sure from Independent member;
of the association for the 
month.

Independent George Chirigoa,
C44,‘ will replace Minno in ‘the
assembly. “

In his letter of resignation, 
no said, “Since my term of oﬂiee
has not expired and I have joined
Delta Tau Delta fraternity, I feel
I would be doing an injustice to,
the Independent party by remain-'
ing a member of the assembly.”

After Minno’s letter of resig’-V
nation was read to the assembly,
Independent Abe Bluestone, C44, ’
repeated the motion made at" Y.
last month’s SFA meeting, that 3
Burford bedismissed from the;
assembly because he was violat-;- -
ing the Equal Representation;
amendment, which states that Y
the assembly members should be ,
selected from representative ~
groups——ie., 16 from the frater-
nity and 16 from the non-frater- Y
nity group.

Upon the recommendation off;
Theodore W. Biddle, dean of men,’ .

Bluestone’s motion was changedltq
read: “Any assembly man who
changes his affiliation will be auto-
matically dismissed from the as-
sembly.” Dean . Biddle’s recom-
mendation was accepted by the as-
sembly and the motion was passed
unanimously.

_ If Burford is dismissed, the mo-3»
tion when applied to his case may 7

be “ex post facto” legislation. Al-
do Icardi, C43, president of Inde-

pendent association said, “the mo-‘
tion was passed upon the assump-1:

tion that Burford would have theﬁ
proper moral attitude to resign,
since Minno resigned.”

 ‘ The mess that SFA found itself in at the beginning of
o the present term, when it was thought that three of the inde-

 ‘has all but been cleared up. , .

brought were Peter Shanta, Al Minno, and Bob Burford.

' Shanta’s case was easiest of all to deal with. He simply

‘ from the group was defeated.

, pendent members of the assembly had pledged to fraternities

Minno and Burford did, however, cast their lot with the
Greek letter boys, and that was where all of the trouble lay.
The fraternity members of SFA argued that it was uncon-
stitutional to expel a member of the assembly merely because

he had pledged fraternity.

Independent leaders pointed out that the action of the
fraternity politicos could hardly be called fair play, in so far
as it violated the spirit, if not the letter, of what a majority of
student voters asked for at the last election-—equal repre-

sentation.

They demanded the expulsion of members.Minno and

Burford.

But with Minno and Burford voting on their own expul-
sion, the motion to drop the Delt and PiKA “independents”

However, one of the two men, Minno, has shown, we
believe, a certain sense of decency and morality that was not
‘exhibited by those who fought to keep him in the assembly.
Minno has resigned from SFA. In his resignation statement
[read to the assembly he indicated that he concurs with the

A > Pitt News contention that fraternity men cannot represent

5 independents in student government.

For his stand we wish to commend Minno. His sacriﬁce of .

Playing up in front of these men
was probably theyfastest line ever
seen on an all-intramural team.
Walt Jones and Norm Frey, both
Punks, were the swiftest men in
the league. Along with PiKA Paul
Lohmeyer, who also rated a ﬁrst
team berth, they are members of
the Panther basketball squad.

Last year, playing for the
Punks, Lohmeyer won a second-

Lohmeyer’s slashing defensive

him a sure choice as a ﬁrst-team

ﬁt lay between Joe Walters, Phi
Gam, and Gerry Block of the Phi
Eps. Both were heads-up, crash-
ing linemen, and either could be
placed on the ﬁrst team. Each re-
ceived the same number of votes,
so it was decided to allow one of
the student officials to make the
choice. His decision put Block on
the ﬁrst team and Walters on the
second.

started last March under Dr.
James S. Taylor, head of the A
mathematics department. “The de-
mand for this work has steadily
increased until 125 students are
now enrolled in the four naviga- '
tion classes in session.

The program covers all aspects
of both air and sea navigation,
including piloting, dead reckog.
ing, radio methods and celestial '
navigation. Army and Navy
manuals furnish the basic sub-

Co-Recreation Hour
Reopened by WAA

W.A.A. is officially starting its
Co-Recreation hour tomorrow from
1:30 to 2:30 o’clock in the Cathe-

Last year this social hour was
one of the most successful parts of
the W.A.A. program and this year
promises to be even better. The
reason is the new phonograph that
the Physical Education depart-
ment has rented for the year.

This victrola has a ﬁne ampli-
fying system and is equipped with
a public address system. And the
records are the latest.
