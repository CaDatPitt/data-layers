Trustees approve 1995 operating budget

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

The University of
Pittsburgh’s board of trustees
approved the university’s fiscal
year 1995 operating budget of
$822.4 million Thursday.

The $822.4 million is l per-
cent higher than the FY 1994
projected budget results of
$814.3 million.

The unrestricted portion of

the FY 1995 budget was also
approved at $434.5 million, up
3.4 percent from last year’s
$420.2 million.

“In spite of continuing bud-
getary constraints, the FY ‘95
budget as approved, will enable
us to maintain the primary and
core academic programs and
activities of the university,”
Chancellor J. Demiis O’Connor
said.

“We will, however, need to

continue to examine our opera-
tions through the long-range
planning process to ensure that
we are managing and allocating
our resources in a prudent and
wise manner for the benefit of
the entire institution.”

Within the FY 1995 budget is
a tuition increase for under-
graduate and graduate students.
Two-term tuition for full-time
in—state undergraduates
increased from $4,750 to

$4,962, an increase of 4.5 per-
cent in the College of Arts and
Sciences, the College of
General Studies and the schools
of Education, Social Work and
Dental Medicine.

Full-time out—of—state under-
graduate students will now pay
$10,786, a 5 percent increase in
those schools.

“Obviously, no one wants a
tuition increase, but it’s going

Following South Africa’s recent first ever
multiracial democratic elections, Pitt’s board of
trustees passed a Senate Council resolution
which permits the University of Pittsburgh to
reinvest in corporations conducting business

with the country.

The resolution overturns a 16-year policy
honoring a prohibitive list for corporations who
had been known to have business ties with

South Africa’s pro-apartheid government.

“The common stock of both U.S. and now
international corporations [doing business in
South Africa] can now be acquired by the uni-
versity through the money manager,” said

Activities
fee to be
Increased

By Jon Hayes
Staff Writer

For almost all Pitt students,
activities fees will increase
slightly this fall.

At its June 30 meeting, Pitt’s
board of trustees approved
requests from various student
governments to raise their
activities fees.

Activities fees for the
College of Arts and Sciences
Student Government Board, the
College of General Studies
Student Government Council,
the Graduate and Professional
Student Association and a new
Study Abroad scholarship will
all be added onto semester bills
next term.

The fee hikes will mark the
first time in several years these
organizations have increased
their financial requests from
students. SGB last approved an
increase in 1987; CGS Student
Government Council in 1990
and GPSA in 1989.

The new student activities fee
rates are:

increase from $32 to $40; a
part-time student increase from
$10 to $12.

Mr. Graham project protesters hold hunger strike

By John B. Moore

News Assistant

Over 50 people across the world joined
in a hunger strike last week to protest the
University of Arizona’s actions surround-
ing the construction of the Mt. Graham
telescope project.

It was announced at a Pittsburgh Mt.
Graham Coalition press conference last
Wednesday that the University of Arizona
was illegally cutting down trees in a
restricted area. In response to this situa-
tion, Mt. Graham activists announced a
hunger strike.

In response to the hunger strike, the

University of Arizona agreed to put off
removing trees until a federal district
court can decide on an injunction which
could lead to a halt in construction while
the legality of the project is discussed.
The strike, lasting as long as four days for
some, was a success, according to
University of Pittsburgh student Matt
Peters, a local participant in the strike.
“This represents a victory and satisfies
our demands.”

Wendy Young, from the Student
Environmental Action Coalition
Southwest, said people from Arizona,
Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., North
Carolina, Italy and Switzerland participat-

ed in the fast. “It was successful in that
what we were wanting to do was done.”

The University of Pittsburgh had shown
interest in the project until the beginning
of April when it announced that it was no
longer considering involvement.

The Mt. Graham Coalition announced
at the press conference that the removal of
trees was illegal because the permit given
by the U.S. Forest Service stated cutting
could not begin until July 1. “They’ve
already been cutting for over five days
now,” Peters said June 29.

Peters also said that Congress in 1988
granted the University of Arizona an area

Student Health Service, UPMC merger not yet finalized

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

By the time classes start in
the fall, there will definitely
be a bigger and better
Student Health Service as it
becomes an official part of
the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center.

“We’re still negotiating
everything,” said Robert G.
Houston, executive assistant
at the Office of the Vice
Chancellor for Student
Affairs. “Nothing has been
signed yet.”

“We will be open for busi-
ness on Aug. 29,” Student
Health Director Dr. Franklin
Carter said. ‘‘There’ll be a
letter of agreement all parties
will sign, even if the i’s are
not dotted and the t’s are not
crossed.”

“It’s really going to be a
beautiful facility,” Carter
said. “The fifth floor has
been completely gutted and
started from scratch. It’ll be
a completely renovated facil-
1ty.”

Not only will all three
Student Health branches be

Upward Bound /inks
Pitt to [col students

By Kathleen Scanlon
For The Pitt News

Rashawn Baugh waits
patiently for the Kennywood
tickets as Renee Frazier digs
them out of her desk.

The tickets are just one of
the “little perks” participants
in the Upward Bound Project
from Pittsburgh public high
schools get for performing
well academically.

“It’s not so much to say
‘You get a reward if you per-
form,’ but to recognize that
‘You did perform,”’ said
Frazier, director of the
Upward Bound Project at
Pitt.

Upward Bound’ provides,
among other services, per-
sonal and academic counsel-
ing and tutorial and study-
skills programs for students
enrolled in Pittsburgh public
high schools who demon-
strate financial and academic
need. According to Frazier,
the project runs throughout
the year with summer pro-
grams that bring high school
students to Pitt. The pro-
grams are designed to inspire
these students to pursue post-
secondary study, Frazier said.

Baugh has participated in
Upward Bound for two years.
She will graduate this month
from Schenley High School
with a 3.52 grade point aver-
age, ranked 32nd out of a
class of 212. This fall she
will attend Pitt with complete
financial support from schol-
arships.

But before she attains
freshman status, Baugh will
live on campus this summer
and take classes at Pitt
through Upward Bound’s
Bridge program.

In the Bridge program, high
school graduates who have
been accepted to college and
have performed well academ-
ically while in the Upward
Bound program “learn what it
is they should or should not
do to be successful in a col-
lege environment,” Frazier
said. She said their classes
and residency in campus resi-
dence halls give them “a head
start” on the college experi-
ence.

Project CALM (Career and
Learning Management),
another summer component
of Upward Bound, also
immerses high school stu-
dents in the college atmos-
phere.

Participants in CALM live
in residence halls on the Pitt
campus and take classes for
six weeks that prepare them
for their fall high-school
schedules, Frazier said.
Classes encompass a swath of
subjects, including basic
math, elementary physics,
Africana Studies and TV pro-
duction.

Participants who are 14 or
15 years old visit sites expos-
ing them to careers that
“mainly require a college

education,” Frazier said...

They visit places such as the
bank, the Pittsburgh Zoo and
the Carnegie Science Center
as well as see professionals
working in finance, food ser-
vice, archaeology, health care
and other fields.

“We want to get them
exposed to as many different
areas as possible yet not
bombard them with too much
information,” Frazier said.

Students also take a career
course where they learn to
write a resume and to present
themselves in job interviews.
The students participate in
mock interviews and answer
sample application questions.

Project CALM places par-
ticipants who are over 15
years old in campus jobs,
Frazier said. Departments
such as the College of Arts
and Sciences Dean’s Office,
the Office of Affirmative
Action and the Accounts
Payable Office send job
descriptions to Frazier, who
then matches the skills and
abilities of CALM partici-
pants and places them in the
appropriate job.

Duties often include library
research for professors, typ-
ing and filing, she said.

Most students perform
basic receptionist duties, but
“a lot depends on how far the
students want to stretch,”
Frazier said.

Students not only gain

°Link, page 4

under one roof, but as part
of UPMC, students can use
new physical therapy facili-
ties.

Houston said the commit-
tee is discussing the “normal
questions” that come up
when there is a merger, such
as “who does what and
when.”

“The act of doing certain
things are not complete,”
said Carter. “The contracting
is very complicated, but we
have legal people who are
handling that.”

While final details are not

complete, Student Health
Service will close its doors
on Aug. 16 for two days of
packing. “Move day” is Aug.
19, but may extend until
Aug. 22 if necessary.

What has been finalized is
the location. The new
Student Health office will be
on the fifth floor of the
Medical Arts Building on
Fifth Avenue.

The Brackenridge Clinic,
Forbes Clinic and Support
Services will also move
there.

“We’ll be able to provide a

higher level of care,”
Houston said, mentioning
that students will again
receive the perks of free
allergy injections, free
X-rays and extended office
hours, all of which had been
cut in the past few years.

Another benefit of Student
Health merging with UMPC
is access to the medical cen-
ter’s computer system.

According to Carter,
Student Health will not have
to phone or fax for informa-
tiongabout specialists and
outside test results.

Reinvest

°From page 1
Senate Council President James Holland
said South Africa’s positive changes have
been tremendous and the resolution “reﬂects
very widespread support for those changes
including the free elections and the Mandela

win.”

On Feb. 8 Senate Council recommended
that.Pitt not reinvest due to South Africa’s
political instability. Holland said the Ad Hoc
Committee on Reinvestment in South Africa

concluded it would be more prudent at that

time to wait until after the April elections
before passing a recommendation.

“The concerns expressed to this committee
was that by no means the free elections
would occur,” Holland said.

Immediately following the elections and

Nelson Mandela’s victory, Senate Council
reconvened and passed the resolution which
the board of trustees made effective in its
meeting June 30.

Full-time in-state students in the School of Engineering will
will

' pay $6,316, a 3.5 percent increase. Out-of-state students
now pay $14,148, a 5 percent increase.

In most other undergraduate and graduate schools, in-state
tuition increased by 4.5 percent and out-of-state increased by 5

percent.

Part-time in-state students will have to pay no more than a 4.5
percent increase, while out-of-state part-time students will pay

approximately 5 percent more than last year.

Because the university held tuition increases to 4.5 percent for
full-time in-state undergraduate, graduate and professional stu-
dents, it qualified for Gov. Robert Casey’s Tuition Challenge
Grant Program. This grant gives the university $200 per in-state
full-time student, based on the 1993 enrollment, totaling $4.2 mil-

lion.

With that program, the FY 1995 Commonwealth Appropriation

increases to $144 million. This appropriation includes:

°$123.5 million for the educational and general line item,

including last year’s Tuition Challenge Funds.

°Funding for the disadvantaged students program was increased

by 2.9 percent, increasing it to $321,000.
°$1 million for the dental clinic.

°$6.2 million for medicine, $7.7 million for Western Psychiatric

Institute and Clinic.
-$497,00 for services for Teens at Risk.

Overall expenditures for the university are expected to increase

by 2.6 percent over the last ﬁscal year, totaling $502.9 million.

The expenditures include compensation increases of $13 mil-

SGB President Ross Pasquale
said a 40 percent cut for student
organization funding in fiscal
year 1994 and a 45 percent
increase in student organizations
since 1987 were the prime rea-
sons for the rate increase. He
cited the 52 percent increase for
The Pitt News ads since 1987,
Telefact’s need for new appara-
tus such as CD-roms, books and
phones and the growing number
of student organizations on cam-
pus as ample justification for
SGB’s new rates.

Pasquale also said students

rely on The Pitt News advertise-
ments to learn of most activities.
Therefore, he said, “We expect
[student organizations] to adver-
tise their events so everyone can
go.”
Molly James, a Chemical-
Engineering junior, agreed with
Pasquale.

“Most people take part in the

Council Vice President Angela
Cerilli said the CGS student
activities increase is necessary
because of CGS’ abundant
activities.

In addition to the rate increas-
es the board passed an SGB res-
olution, which was first pro-
posed in 1991, to institute a $1
per semester charge to all full-
time students so that a Study
Abroad scholarship fund will be
implemented.

Pasquale said the new fee will
result in $25,000 to $27,000 for
Study Abroad scholarships.

Zach Cooper, a ﬁrst-year CAS
student, said he is looking for-
ward to applying for a Study
Abroad scholarship.

“We don’t have a lot of
money. Anything that will make
[overseas study] cheaper, and a
scholarship will help, then I
would definitely apply for it,”
Cooper said.

Director of the Study Abroad
program Annagene Yucas said
her office is unsure how the
fund will be distributed.

Yucas said CAS Dean Mary
Briscoe sponsors a $10,000
scholarship of which one student

Pitt students can partici-

have a solid QPA and an
interest in working with
high school students.

“It’s not just a job,”
Frazier said.

Tutors serve as role mod-
els. "‘They can help [the
high school students] acade-
mically and help them to
grow personally.”

“It's not just survival,” she
said. “We feel we're also
making a contribution.”

Those interested in tutor-
ing should apply at the

Because the University of

filed by 22 organizations
suing the Forest Service and
other agencies for violating
the Arizona-Idaho

According to Peters, an

“Apparently what’s going

Peters said the University

“The persons responsible

Freeze student fees

Creative accounting —— although it is not a course taught
here, Pitt administrators would make excellent instructors.

Creative accounting is their creed, their motto, their key to
success.

Gov. Robert Casey proposed the Tuition Challenge Grant
Program, which would reward the four state-related univer-
sities (Pitt, Penn State, Temple and Lincoln) and the 14
state—owned universities for capping increases in tuition by
4.5 percent.

Casey, who has a soft spot in his heart for Pitt, will reward
Pitt by giving it $200 for each full-time, in-state student.

This means millions of state dollars will be awarded to Pitt
for keeping tuition increases to a maximum of 4.5 percent.
Thanks Gov. Casey.

Let’s examine the points.

If tuitions are compared between 1993-94 and 1994-95,
total undergraduate tuition only went up 4.4 percent, the year
before that, tuition onlyjwent up by 5 percent. '

Rising tuitions are not the only thing bleeding undergradu-
ate students profusely.

Undergraduate student fees have increased by more than
70 percent in the past four years. This tends to offset the so-
called tuition cap imposed by the state. .

If Pitt really wanted to make a financial difference in the
lives of its tapped—out students, a cap should also be placed
on the student fees as well.

Many fiscally dark avenues are lighting up for Pitt admin-
istrators as they create or increase student fees, which until
recently have been left dormant.

Students are facing an increase in the student activities fee,
and an additional $1 fee for Study Abroad.

This could turn into aiprofitable dreamland for Pitt admin-
istrators while at the same time becoming a monetary night-
mare for unsuspecting students.

Where should the line be drawn concerning student fees?
How much is too much?

What percentage of students actually use the services they
are charged for?

How long would it take to conduct a study to find out the
answers to these questions?

Would another fee such as the student fee research project
fee be tacked on to tuition to find the answers to these ques-
tions?

How about a right-to—breathe fee, a right-to—walk—on-cam-
pus—sidewalks fee, a library fee and a telephone fee?

The possibilities are endless —— unfortunately.

Unless Pitt caps student fees, the Tuition Challenge Grant
Program would be nothing but a PR hot balloon, that holds
no air, but gains the university more money.

The university should immediately cap the number of fees
and total amount paid for student fees — for the good of the

students.

Right

During the
1984 senatori-
alcampaign in
N o r t h
Carolina, Jesse
Helms’ oppo-
nent, incum-
bent Gov. Jim
Hunt, ran a

Columnist spot which
Rick showed a cou-
Nowlin ple in bed, the

camera sweeping to a khaki-
clad policeman. The armouncer
said, “Think Jesse Helms is
against big government? Think
again.”

That one spot crystallized my
thinking as to one reason I’ve
been so critical of the conserva-
tive movement: its-hypocrisy.
For the past couple of decades,

the right has °°m' “The right has also shown that it

fatal mistake of taking on the
Pentagon, and that eventually
cost him his job. He criticized
the Reagan administration in his
two “The Triumph of Politics”
books: The Inside Story of the
Reagan Administration and
Why the Reagan Revolution
Failed.

’ The right has also shown that
it isn’t being honest when it
comes to big giveaways of gov-
ernment money. There’s always
been a whole lot of talk about
welfare reform, especially when
it comes to the poor maintaining
a lifestyle “onthe dole” and

with the conservatives. The
trouble is that most of the peo-
ple who beneﬁt from “welfare”

loves big government, too

promote “God-and-country” as
a type of civil religion. But
remember that, during the mid-
l800s, a number of Southern
states decided to leave the
Union. Was it over slavery? No.
They wanted to tell Washington
to go to hell. They opposed the
civil rights movement for the
same reason,and to this day
Martin Luther King Jr. is con-
sidered to be a communist (this
despite Dr. King’s own opposi-
tion to communism). Consider
George Wallace, the former
governor of Alabama who stood
at the entrance of the University
of Alabama in 1962 in order" to
bar hlaslsé tram strains: He
said later that “we p anned to

Africa and the politi-
cians who wanted to
“go slow” on ridding

cems, it is every bit as
“liberal” as the people it criti-
cizes.

Conservatives like to refer to
the Founding Fathers’ aversion
to too much political authority
as the reason they wrote the
Constitution the way they did.
What they fail to mention is that
the “framers” were also the eco-
nomic leaders, so of course they
weren’t' about to put any brakes
on their livelihood.
Furthermore, there wasn’t too
much need for a government
back then, because a high per-
centage of people had enough
wealth to support themselves.
Nothing like today; just 1 per-
cent of the population controls
nearly half the wealth.

So why do I think that conser-
vatives are hypocrites? Let’s
start with David Stockman,
President Reagan’s budget
director. Reagan had cam-
paigned basically on a platform
of “balance the budget, cut
taxes and raise defense spend-
ing” — which should tell you
something right there. So
Stockman did his job, slashing
social programs left and right,
and the conservatives cheered.
But then Stockman made the

are rich. Want some examples?
The aforementioned Sen.
Helms, a bedrock of old-fash-
ioned Southern-style conser-
vatism, won’t vote against
tobacco subsidies. It’s no coin-
cidence that he represents a
state which grows much of the
nation’s tobacco. Cobb County,
Ga., just outside Atlanta, the
site of a recent controversy over
a play that supposedly promot-
ed gay rights, receives about
$10 million a day in federal aid
- courtesy of its congressman,
House Minority Whip Newt
Gingrich.

How about education?
Conservatives helped to push
through cuts in funding for
higher education, but now they
want the public to help fund pri-
vate elementary and secondary
schools (so-called “school
choice”) and they have the gall
to suggest that it has to do with
“giving parents more options.”
What they really want to do is
destroy the public school sys-
tem for the simple reason that
they can’t control it. Period.

The double standard also
shows up in history.
Southerners are often the first to

that nation of apartheid,
under which there were laws
regulating where one could live,
what kind of job one could
have, even whom one could
marry. Want to talk about gov-
ernment interference in people’s
lives? All because of their
obsession with communism.
Now, there is a communist
influence in groups like the
African National Congress, and
I’m no fan of Nelson Mandela,
but it was that other evil system
that drove many blacks toward
Marxism in the ﬁrst place.

Marx and Engels actually
benefitted from a system they
wanted to overthrow, and the
same could be said for today’s
American right. I remember a
song I heard when I was in high
school; the chorus went:

‘‘I can’t stand to see the
slaughter/But still I eat the
meat/I can’t stand dishonest
people/But still sometimes I
cheat/I can’t stand that air pollu-
tion/But still I drive a
car/Maybe them’s [sic] the rea-
sons why/Things are like they

A Night in San Francisco
Van Morrison
Polydor

Over the past 15 years, Van
Morrison’s music has moved
from the blues romp of the
early ‘70s, such as His Band
and the Street Choir and
Moondance to the ultra-per-
sonal religious and literary
introspective of Common One
to the more recent bluesy
return of Too Long in Exile.
Many people think of Van as
having become a big-headed,
pretentious snob. I like to think
of him as a shy, pill—popping
artist. After listening to A
Night in San Francisco, I
know that he’s just a career
music fan with a “huge set of
lungs,” a religion complex, a
collection of great songs and a
lot of extremely talented
friends.

Anyone who refers to Van as
an egotist needs to listen to the
relish in his voice as he hands
the microphone and his songs
over to his Belfast—bom friend
Brian Kennedy, or the pride
with which he introduces saxo-
phonist Candy Dulfer.
Morrison has put together a
show more like an Irish Pub
music session than a rock con-

cert. His band consists of some
of the top names in rock, jazz
and blues, such as organist
Georgie Fame, Dulfer on sax
and the Dream Academy’s
Kate St. John on oboe.
Morrison is content to sit out
entire songs in order to hear
them done the way he wants:
the best way. The songs
bounce from musician to musi-
cian, with no emphasis on any-
thing except the song itself; no
one stands out as being the
star, not even Van. Perhaps his
creeping years have taught him
something most modern musi-
cians need to learn.

From the opening track, the
religious jazz—pop tune “Did
Ye Get Healed,” through to the
gospel-shout, he1l—raising ren-
dition of “Gloria” which ends
the double album. We are
given a selection of jazz and
blues standards, Morrison
songs and musical allusions to
Sam Cooke, Bob Dylan, John
Lee Hooker and anyone else
Van admires. The energy level
doesn’t drop, even through
pieces like the 14 and 16
minute soul revues which his
versions of “It’s a Man’s,
Man’s, Man’s World” and
“Lonely Avenue” become.

However, it is important to
note that this is an album for
those already fans of Van
Morrison, and, more specifi-
cally, the past 15 years of
Van’s career.

For those of you who may be
blues fans, it’s worth picking
up for a few choice cuts and
guests. Van’s “Stormy
Monday” feels as straight from
the veins as it gets. Jimmy
Witherspoon’s vocals on
“Have You Ever Loved a
Woman” sends chills down my
spine, as do Junior Wells on
the Sonny Boy Williamson
classics “Help Me” and “Good

 

The Belft Blae,n Morrison, makes it family affair in his fine A Night in San Francisco.

Morning Little School Girl”.
Finally, the encore perfor-
mance of “Gloria,” a foot-
stompin’ gospel exchange
entered via the Johnny Kidd
and the Pirates rocka-moda-
billy classic “Shakin’ All
Over,” complete with brief yet
spirited appearance from John
Lee Hooker, is worth the
whole album. I will take this
moment to comment on the
psychotic/erotic guitar work of
Mr. Ronnie Johnson, whose
solo on “Shakin’ All Over” is
reminiscent of Bo Diddley,

Yo! What’s up Pittsburgh? I’m back from the
underground and I got mad, mad, mad funk with
me. I got scoop about a Phat new artist out of
Brentwood, Long Island, new music reviews and
an album to look forward to.

Now to get down to business, if you thought that
Brentwood only had two people to ever blow up,
you’re dead wrong. There’s a new man breakin’
through and his name is Craig Mack. I already
know your first question: Who is Craig Mack?
Well, let me tell ya the kid got more funk than Pig
Pen’s draws. To put it simple and plain, the boy is
dope. But, I know you’re still asking: Who is Craig
Mack? Well, let me start from the beginning. Craig
started out on the popular, but now-defunct, Fresh
Sleeping Bagg Records (former home to Nice’N
Smooth and now—defunct E.P.M.D.) as a young
M.C. with a little potential but he needed time to
mature. Well, he really didn’t get a chance to do
that because of the untimely demise of the compa-
ny. So the rapper had to try to take his style and
shop it somewhere else. Craig’s story almost seems
as though it was written by Walt Disney, a
“Cinderella” story if you will. He shopped his
demo around to more record companies than you
could imagine; he wound up with the same result
from all of them: NO! So you can imagine what
your average brotha would have done, but Craig
stuck to his guns and kept the faith.

To go into how much Craig kept the faith, peep
this, he went on tour with E.P.M.D. not as a per-

   

former, not as a D.J., not even as a soundman; he
was in charge of the baggage. That’s right. He car-
ried bags and cleaned up the tour bus. To put it
short the man has paid his dues. Craig would later
say that was one of the hardest things he ever had
to watch; when the Hit Squad would get together
and do the finale to the show “Headbanger.” He
would say how that ate him up inside and how
every time he just wanted to get out there and just
freak it. Although they wouldn’t let him perform,
Erick and Parish still gave him pointers on the
business and music. Craig would also sneak into a
recording and do work for his demo to try to bring
to E and P. When everything was ready E.P.M.D.
broke up and once again Craig Mack was out
again.

After one closed door, Craig Mack finally got the
light at the end of the tunnel. While at a club in
New York, Craig met Sean “Puffy” Combs (Combs

was A&R man at Uptown entertainment and is
responsible for blowing up Mary J. Blige, Jodeci
and Heavy D and the Boyz). Puffy heard Craig
freestyle and signed him on the spot, but he had to
rhyme on a remix for Mary J . So, he did the rhyme,
but soon after Puffy left Uptown and started his
own record label, BadBoy Records. For awhile, it
seemed as though the label wouldn’t be picked up
and Mack had a chance to leave, but he stayed
because he felt that if Puffy was willing to take a
chance on him he should stick it out. After a few
tight moments BadBoy was picked up by Arista
Records and now you’ll be able to buy the funk
from Craig Mack and his label mate the Notorius
B.I.G. (a.k.a. Biggie Smalls) in a few weeks .So in
the mean time you can hear Craig Mack exclusive-
ly on WPTS 98.5 FM. The song to look for is
called “Flava In Your Ear.” It’s off his forthcoming
debut album Project Funk The World.

So, let me leave with these parting shouts. To my
girl, Lori Scott, the girl who gets more props than a
cop I wanna say what’s up. To my man D.J. Chip,
keep cuttin’ it up with that fried Rino lipp. Peace to
my niggs Blakk Steele, Tenth Brotha Packin Much
and to the Contemporary Older Brotha Angello
Madison. Next props go to my boys Calvin and Al,
Deanna, Nicki and Kim. Now to my crew, the
4OD’s, DeeTee and Tone, much love goes to ya. To
the crew at the Underground One Love. Other than
that C-Ya

There is, certainly, music for

sure to disappoint those who
gave up on Van after 1974, or
those who are just starting out.
This is because, and here is the
album’s catch and commercial
downfall, this is sort of the

album: if you don’t know all

from, you’re going to end up

The quintet draws on the
sounds and looks of a lounge
band from  let's say the early

‘60s. Everything from the

album title on down tries to
put you in the mind-set of that
era.

The front of I, Swinger
shows a blurred close-up of
two cocktails. The compact
disc looks like an old record
label, with phrases “directional
hi-fi sound” and “dynamic
digital stereo” on it.

The liner notes welcome you
to the proceedings, as a
“Citizen of the Cocktail
Nation.” They throw around
references to La Dolce Vita
and words like “bon-vivants”
and: “demi-mondaines.”

So the members of the band
appear to put a lot into the
appearance. They want to look
really cool and hip before you
even put the needle on the
record  uh, I mean, load the

Cudahy have dropped their
Christmas names to become
Miss Lily Banquette and The
Millionaire for this band.

I, Swinger could have been
the soundtrack to a foreign
mystery film in the ‘60s. In
fact, the quintet opens with
“Cadillac,” a song written by
Nino Rota, an Italian compos-
er who scored many such pic-
tures. The original “Impact!”
could have provided the back-
drop for a chase scene through
the back alleys of Europe.

What keeps the album con-
sistent is that the group
doesn’t try to stick with one
particular formula. On
“Intermission,” they investi-
gate the tango. “Carnival of
Souls” conjures up the image
of a roller rink for skeletons,
with its big organ sound.

Elsewhere, Banquette gives
a reading of the torch song
“Cry Me a River” and Kurt
Weill’s “Surabaya Johnny”
which both dispel any notion
that this is a joke to be taken
lightly. And when she isn’t
singing, the chanteuse plays
drums, which gives Aaron
Oppenheimer the chance to
switch from the drum kit to
the Vibraphone.

Throughout I, Swinger, the
arrangements come off as sub-
tle but effective. Unlike a
group like Naked City, who
tried to expose and dismember
the clichés of lounge music,
Combustible Edison shows a
discipline and reverence to the
music. As a result they bring
out the best in the music like
the writing itself.

If you’re looking for the
perfect album to put on during
a quiet dinner with a fine
wine, go no further.

And if you aren’t looking
for such an album, well,
buddy you’re just a square.

Mobley goes to Milwaukee
The Bucks selet themr Pienter at No. l8 spot

By Jack Becker
Sports Editor

The wait to hear his name
reverberate through the
Indianapolis Hoosier Dome
was not a prolonged one. As
the 18th selection of the
Milwaukee Bucks in this
year’s NBA draft, Eric Mobley
became the highest Pitt player
taken since 1988, when
Charles Smith was the third
pick.

Mobley, 24, donned the
Bucks cap last week in front of

an en-

tourage of

family and

friends that

included

Pitt team-

m a t e

- Jermaine

Morgan and his smiling new
agent.

Despite dropping a few spots ~

from where he had been pro-
jected to be taken, Mobley,
who visited 12 NBA clubs
before the draft, is pleased
with being chosen by
Milwaukee.

“I feel real good,” Mobley
said. “I like the coaching staff
a lot. When I was there, they

Football team heads
to camp injury free

By Matt Groff

Asst. News Editor

The countdown stands at
two months until Johnny
Majors makes a second effort
at bringing Pitt back to the
future. At this point, it seems
Pitt’s offense will be healthy
and rolling on all wheels going
into preseason camp in
Johnstown.

Offensive lineman Matt
Bloom is the most recent Pitt
f 0 o t b a 1 1
player to
undergo
surgery this
summer and
according to
a s s i s t a n t
t r a i n e r
Kevin Conley, Bloom will join
several other Panthers return-
ing to 100 percent health by
August.

Bloom, a two-year letterman
who will be a senior this year,
figures to be a major part of an
offensive line which will be
protecting the shaky quarter-
back situation at Pitt. His June
24 operation repaired damaged
tissue in his leg after being
carted off the field during
practice last spring.

 

‘‘It was not an injury from
spring practice,” Conley said.
“It was a chronic condition
which he had for years and it
got worse. The operation was
very straightforward and he is
in basic rehabilitation now.”

Bloom’s defensive line
counterpart, junior Matt
Hosilyk, underwent surgery
earlier in the summer to repair
a torn meniscus in his left
knee.

“It was an injury he sus-
tained during [spring] prac-
tice,” Conley said. “He never
had a problem with it before
and it shouldn’t be a problem
after rehabilitation. He is com-
ing along very well right now.”

According to Conley, both
players will be ready for camp,
as will receivers Dietrich Jells
and Chad Askew. Askew did
not have surgery this summer,
but both receivers are retum-
ing after missing most of last
season.

Jells, a junior, played in the
first three games of ‘93 before
he had surgery for a leg injury.
He was a preseason second
team All—Big East pick by The
Sporting News prior to the
injury. In ‘92, Jells racked up

sure I’m gonna go onto the
next level and be very com-
fortable and I think, in
Milwaukee I will be.”

Mobley’s stock rose consid-
erably at a pre-draft camp in
Phoenix, as he averaged 15
points and 10 rebounds. He
ended the camp as a member
of the Dessert Classic all-tour-
nament team.

Speculation was that Mobley
might go higher in the draft at
either No. 14 New Jersey or
No. 16 Golden State, but the
scenario never panned out.
New Jersey had George
Washington’s 7-1 Yinka Dare,
who was expected to go in the
lottery, fall into its lap and
Golden State ended up taking
Louisville’s 6-9 Clifford
Rozier. I

The Bucks were more than
happy to see Mobley available
at No. 18.

Mobley, from New York
City, is considered to be a
player with “tremendous
upswing,” according to scouts,
meaning he has hardly begun
to tap his potential. Mobley’s
offensive skills, averaging
only 10 points in his career,
lag behind NBA material, but
his rebounding, aggressiveness
and shot blocking made him a
No. 1 selection.

“I think they picked me
because they thought I could

do [the little things],” Mobley
said. “I don’t mind setting the
picks to get somebody else
open. As long as we win I
have no problem and I think
we will win now and then.”

Mobley might have been
contemplating life with
Milwaukee’s other No. 1 pick
when he spoke of “getting
somebody else open.” The
Bucks landed the prize of the
draft by taking Purdue’s Glenn
Robinson, who Mobley most
certainly will set a screen or
two for in the future, No. 1
overall.

Milwaukee also chose
Minnesota’s 6-4 Voshon
Lenard in the second round.
The 6-10, 250-pound former
Pitt center averaged 13.7
points, 8.8 rebounds and 2.8
blocks a game his senior sea-
son and finished his career sec-
ond on Pitt’s all-time blocked
shots list. He also shot 57 per-
cent from the field, mostly on
dunks, in his three seasons
with the Panthers.

Mobley will have to com-
pete at center next year with
the Bucks first round pick of a
year ago, Vin Baker. Baker
made the NBA’s All—Rookie
team this year.

Surprisingly, this was not
Mobley’s first trip to the NBA
draft. Six years ago, Mobley

Smith and Aiken open C & C
Sports Arena in Oakland

By Travis Senseny
Staff Writer

Two former University of
Pittsburgh basketball stars
are hoping to make their
presence felt once again in
the Oakland community.

Current New York Knicks
Charles Smith and former
Pitt guard Curtis Aiken are
not going to do it on the bas-
ketball court, but will be
impacting the Oakland busi-
ness community.

Smith and Aiken have
opened a sports apparel store
on Centre Avenue called
C&C Sports Arena.

The grand opening of the
store June 25 featured a
Charles Smith autograph-
signing session, a live
WAMO radio broadcast and
appearances by Pitt Athletic
Director Oval Jaynes and
several current Pitt basket-
ball players.

“This is something that we
as players would sit in the
locker room and talk and
dream about and it became a
reality,” Aiken said. I

Women ’s track team
secures five freshmen
stars fort/1e future

By David Saliba
Staff Writer

Five newly-acquired recruits
for . the
Pittsburgh track and field team
are ready to begin careers and
break records.

According to Steve Lewis,
head coach of the track pro-
gram at Pitt, the freshman
class excites him.

“We have ﬁve standout ath-
letes that will contribute right
away to our program,” Lewis
said. “They are outstanding
competitors, and I can’t wait
until next season.”

Of the five recruits, Lewis’
voice and words become
ecstatic when talking about

‘But:

Track

Anna Kohler, a foreign
exchange student from Berlin,
Germany.

“We think that Anna is just a
blue-chip athlete,” Lewis said.
“ e h show xce tional
aiilit; liar; ,é‘8§ aéierg is
100 meters.”

As for Kohler, her accep-
tance to Pitt is a dream come
true.

“I was an exchange student
for one year and I was sup-
posed to go back to Germany.
Now I have a scholarship,”
Kohler said. “That is my
dream, I wanted to do that and
now I am doing it.”

According to Danny
Thompson, who coached
Kohler at Menchville High
School in Newport News, Va.,
she has an immense amount of
potential.

This past season she ranked
number three in the United
States in the 500 meters. From
there she went on to be the
Virginia state champion in the
800 meters with her fastest
time being 2:13.

Thompson, who is a former
athlete of Lewis’ (when Lewis
coached at Menchville High
School), said he believes
Kohler will excel at Pitt.

“Pitt was her first and only
choice,” Thompson said. “She
will make a great impact her
first year.”

Another athlete of
Thompson’s that will join
Kohler at Pitt is J oetta Purter, a
state champion in the interme-
diate hurdles.

“I started running the hur-
dles my junior year,” Purter
said. “I ran the quarter prior to
that year and over the summer
I messed around with the hur-
dles and I ended up doing
well.”

University of‘

“Joetta has only been hur-
dling for two years so she is
very new at the event,”
Thompson said. “She is a very
versatile runner. I feel most
definitely that she will make
an impact at Pitt.”

Another recruit that has ties
to the Pitt program is Rashida
Daniels from Brentwood High
School in Bayshore, N.Y.
Daniels is the younger sister of
Niambi Daniels, a jumper on
the Pitt track team who will be
a senior in the fall. %

Unlike her older sister,
Daniels will be in the throwing
events when she comes to Pitt.

“She’ll be in the throws, her
expertise is in the shot put,”
Lewis said. “I know the family
personally and I have observed
her. In terms of her potential I
think she can make an impact
her first year in the Big East;
in the shot put definitely.”

“Shot put is my specialty,
but I’m going to work as hard
as I can,” Daniels said.

A similar athlete who will
add to the field team is Allison
Sams, a Pennsylvania state
champion in the shot put from
nearby Butler High School.

“She is a state champion in
the shot and has the ability to
become potentially a heptath-
lete,”Lewis said. “Allison

throws and she has speed
enough to run.”

“They didn’t have the hep-
tathlon at my high school, but
I think it’ll be a lot of fun at
Pitt,” Sams said. “I like chal-
lenges and I’m really looking
forward to working with the
other heptathletes.”

Stacey Anderson, who
rounds out the five recruits, is
a distance runner from Salem
High School in Greensburg.

“She should be able to help
us out immediately,” Lewis
said.

“I’ve always wanted to go to
Pitt,” Anderson said. “I’ve
been training all summer and I
can’t wait to get there.”

For Lewis, he has an enthu-
siastic bunch who all are eager
to begin running and throwing.
He even has a few who are
looking to be the best Pitt ever
had.

“I can’t wait to compete with
Najuma,” Sams said referring
to All-American Najuma
Fletcher. “I want to set new
records and I think I can. I can
hold my own.”

According to Kohler, this is
all she has been thinking of
since her childhood in
Germany.

“I want to go to the next
level,’’ Kohler said. “I know I
can do it.”

Thompson agrees.

“She is so versatile,”
Thompson said. “She’ll break
records and set records and
then she’ll go on to the next
level.”

Neither Smith nor Aiken
are new to the business
world. Aiken owns a barber-
shop, which is next door to
the new business, and Smith
said he owned sports—mar-
keting firms in the two cities
he played NBA basketball
in, Los Angeles and New
York.

Smith said that he and
Aiken modeled the shop
after a store a friend of
Smith’s owns in Bridgeport,
Conn.

Current Panther Orlando

Antigua said it is very
important for Panther alumni
to show support for the com-
munity.

“I like it out here. If I can
do something like this [after
I graduate], it would be great
for me and Pittsburgh too.”

Smith was excited to
return to the Pitt community.
He said, “It’s good that I got
to see a lot of guys I went to
school with. Without this I
might not have got to see
them again.”

Although the business cel-
ebrated its celebrity owner-

ship at its opening, store
manager Frank Brown said
the store’s location and its
representatives, like Nike,
are much more integral to
the store’s success than the
guys who own it.

Brown said, “We want to
satisfy everybody; if we
don’t have it now we can get
it for you.”

According to Antigua, the
business can only benefit the
basketball program. “We get
to experience some of what
they learned. They can teach
us business,” he said.

Mobley, out of Salesian High School in New York City, is
only the third Pitt first round NBA draft pick since 1988.

Mobley

attended the event as a friend of the Portland Trailblazers’ Rod
Strickland. That day Strickland was picked by his hometown
team, the New York Knicks. The scene made an impression on
the young Mobley.

“I used to have dreams of somebody calling out my name and
me being right here,” Mobley said shortly after being drafted.

“I remember when [the New Jersey Nets and New York City
native] Kenny Anderson told me, ‘Eric you’ll feel what it’s like
to play in the NBA sometime,’ and it happened and it feels real-
1y good,” Mobley said.

1,091 yards and became Pitt’s-
single season leader in recep-
tions and receiving yards.

Conley said he saw no sign
of any problems with Jells,
who split time between foot-
ball practice and meets with
the Pitt men’s track team, dur-
ing spring drills.

“[Jells’ leg] shouldn’t be
bothersome,” Conley said. “It
would take a very traumatic
hit to reinjure it.”

Another player who figures
to rebound off an injury and
make an offensive impact is
6-foot-4—inch senior receiver
Askew.

Askew suffered a broken
finger in Pitt’s second game
last year, causing him to miss
the rest of the season. Conley
said Askew, who was plagued
by hamstring and shoulder
injuries in ‘92, should have no
problem with the finger injury
this year.

Askew, a two-year letter-
man, averaged more than 16
yards per catch in both ‘9l
and ‘92.

Additionally, senior run-
ningback Curtis Martin,
whose injured shoulder kept
him out of action during a few
games last season, should also
be at full speed for preseason
camp.

The five junior national

Bissell is a strong breast- ’

return of a healthy Jill

could be the answer.

400—meter individual medley,
the 100 fly and the 100
back.

Diving wise, the Panthers
have got to be happy to add
to an already tough diving
team.

“Julian [Krug] is very
excited about Buffy Smith,”
Cassidy said.

Smith of Hermitage, Pa.
will be apprenticing under
two of the top divers in the
Big East in Sunday
Lewandowski and Kara
Sixbury. Names aside, the big
thing about this recruiting
class is its size. The Pitt
women were drawn by the
depth of some of their oppo-
nents last season.

By adding 17 new recruits
to the team and only losing
three to graduation, the
Panthers will be better
equipped to have multiple
swimmers place in an event,
instead of just surrendering
points as a lack of depth
forced the team to do last
year.
