Broderic_k’s aim is to narrow

‘ the tuition gap between state sup-

ones. He contends his plan will
save ‘Pennsylvania taxpayers be-
tween $l00 million and $150 mil-

lion.

Tuition at Pitt. currently $425
per term for full-time undergrad-
uates who are Pennsylvania resi-
dents. went up last month by $70
per term. It is still low in coin-
parison with Duquesne.l'niversi-

FAVQRITISM CONDEMNED

Broderick doesnt believe Pitt
should be "favored" by the Com-
monwealth. while private univer-

sities face _serious difficulties in .

attracting students because of
their high tuition ra-tes. ’

"The principal manner "of state
support of higher education is.
through direct subsidies to insti-

’ Conference     To Probe

Urban Centralization

\

Aware of the need to explore methods of decision making in cities.

the University's Intercollegiate Conference on Government has set up
a conference to study government in urban areas. The conference will
deal largely with the struggle between people who defend centralized
government and the advocates of decentralization.

The conference will run two days. Thursday and Friday. from 7:30-
II p.m. each evening in David L. Lawrence Hall. The topic.of discus-
sion the first evening is "Politics and Government": the second night.
speakers will address themselves to the topic_of "The Urban Commun-

ity."

Sy adler. co-chairman of the Intercollegiate Conference on Govern-
ment. explained the various subtopics that will be discussed. The first

evening speakers will dwell on the historical context of city govern- "

ment: they will explain the actual structures where decisions are made.

Speakers the first evening will include Samuel Hays, professor of
history at Pitt; Richard Thornburgh, former chairman of the Drafting
' Committee for the Pittsburgh Home Rule Charter Advisory Commit-

« /ftee; Milton Kotler, author of Neighborhood Government; and John Ta-

bor, former Pittsburgh mayoralty candidate.

" _ Hays-will discuss the historical context of the centralization-decen-
tralization conflict; Kotler will advocate decentralized government in
urban areas. A defense of centralized government will. be given by
Thornburgh. while Tabor will give an assessment of both sides of the

issue.

Specific areas where governmental solutions can be or have been

“ABLE TO PAY”

According to Broderick. many
students at Pitt and other state-
related universities are “quite
able to pay the higher costs'"that
would be imposed. "For those un-
able to pay their own way." he ob-
served. “student aid through the
present state scholarship pro-
gram. supplemented by a massive
loan program. is the answer."

In a speech yesterday before A

the Pennsylvania Association’ of .
Colleges and Universities, Brod-
erick emphasized that his propos-
ed elimination of grants to institu-
tions of higheiflearning’ would be
gradual. '

Addressing the same group. his
opponent. Milton Shapp disagreed
that "cutting back or cutting out
state grants to. colleges and uni-
versities" and "raising tuition"
is the answer.- ' ' '

Yearbook At Sit-In   H 

by DANA‘ VENTRIGLIA

Dr. _Charles Montgomery was
the target of a sit-in staged Mon-
day by-a small group of Universi-
ty women to protest. among other
things. a section of the l970'()wl
Yearbook. ‘

The newly-appointed dean of
the (mice of Student Development
was presented with a statement
which condemned ‘the publication
as being “blatantly racist and sex-
ist." It also said that the yearbook
“depicts women as sexual objects
and undermines the legitimacy
and importance of womens de-
mands."

’ The participants were repre-
sentative of the Council. for Wom-
enis Rights. the Pittsburgh Chap-
ter of National Organization for
Women. the Pittsburgh Radical

ty Committee for Women's Rights.

Referendum Soon

  Views on C0nstitutionAired

by BOB BON N
While the new Student Govern-

‘_ ment Constitution will come up

for a referendum in early Novem-

al, approves of it. “’

In a Pitt News interview, Vice-

WCharicellor for Student Affairs

Bernard Kobosky, speaking for

. New Career

the administration, explained sev-
eral weaknesses he found in the
proposed document. The first con-
cerned the powers of the Alloca-
tions Committee, but this flaw
was corrected when it was found
that an error had been made in
typing the constitution.

Kobosky’s objection to the work
was that it made no mention of

formal approval by either the ad-_

ministration or the Board of Trus-
tees. “The legality of this may
even be questionable,” he said.

The present constitution had
been approved by several groups
before ratification.

Proponents of the new docu-
ment have -argued,that since it is
a constitution for students, it need
not be formally ratified by any
higher group, though they do plan
to submit it to them for a vote of
confidence.

Kobosky mentioned, however.
that ratification by the adminis-
tration or the trustees would give
the new constitution more legiti-
macy in the eyes of such bodies.

Concerning ratification by the
administration or trustees, Stu-
dent Government President Len-

ny Klavonic said: “Since it is a
constitution of the students gov-
erning the students, the legitima-
cy should come from them.”

He added: “Students do not di-

rectly vote on trustees or admin-

istration policy; but only give
their vote of approval. In view of
that. all we are asking in return is
a vote of confidence from the trus-
tees and the administration.

“Basically. though, I think the
idea is good." Kobosky empha-
sized. "I like the approach. If they
can just tie up some of these loose
ends. I'd be even more happy
about it."

CAS EXPERIMENTAL
PROGRAM

This winter. a number of stu-'

dents. assisted by faculty advisor
Steve Rosen of the Political Sci-
ence Department. are forming a
study group dealing with models
of non-violent social order. The
course is funded by the College of
Arts and Sciences (CAS) experi-
mental program.

This group will probe deeply
into aspects of nonviolence

through a program including film,
speakers, -and simulations.

Suggested topics of discussion
include non-violence in Utopian
Literature. cultural correlates of
violence‘ and non-violence, non-
violent movements. non-violent
socialization of children, and non-
violent modes of living.

The study will not be limited to
readings and discussion, but will
make use of group activity in an
effort to see how peace theory re-
lates to the personal interactions
of group members.

Members of the group will take
roles in simulations involving the

confrontation of violent elements .

of society with peace-oriented ele-
ments. During the course, stu-
dents will participatein a week-
end workshop dealing with the na-
ture of conflict and peace.

Those interested in joining, this

group may contact Joseph Wild,»

ii The American Theatre has few

 

great playwrights . . . one or two
perhaps? With a cry for new tal-
ent there has emerged a number
of new writers. However, many
suffer from a common ailment
. . .a lack of naturalness.

Two ‘things which are neces-
sary in a work of note are that
dialogue and situations be natural
and reminiscent of life itself (un-
less there is a definite reason to
deviate from this plane) and that
verbosity, although sometimes
justifiable in life, be avoided.

The play. in whatever form.
must be put together well. and ac-
tors should be able to act—or at
least stick to the point of the
whole thing. It is with these ideas
in mind. that I look at the triple

atre last week-end and to be re-
peated this coming one.

Student Handbook
To Be Made Available

by BOB BONN

A new student handbook, in the
works for over a year, will be
available in several weeks, ac-
cording to Vice-Chancellor for
Student Affairs Bernard Kobosky,
pending the working out of an im-
portant section on student conduct.

Based on extensive research by
1970 graduate Diane Ulyon, now
working in the Office of Govern-
mental Relations, the handbook
will be the first complete explan-
ation of the many judicial boards
on campus and will include a large
section on student services.

Explaining the delay, Miss Uly-
on said that consideration had
briefly been given to making a
specific, concrete detailing of. stu-
dent responsibilities, but instead,
a summary of University regula-
tions will be published.

These regulations are in a way
rather confused since they have
been instituted at various times
from various offices over the past
15 to 20 years. According to
Miss Ulyon, the problem was to
get all these into some semblance
of readable form to “make some

(‘sense of it.”

Further, Kobosky is setting up

a student-faculty-administration
committee to comprehensively
review all University laws, a
procedure which has been insti-
tuted_at many other universities
.recently. This investigation has
been spurred by the report of the
Scranton Commission on the Kent
State shootings of last May.

Until an entire revision is com-
pleted, however, Miss Ulyon
stressed that the handbook will
function as an up-to-date guide-
line for students.

is just not that interesting nor
amusing.

This is partially because of the
acting itself. Aside from Thomas

Davey. who in his first role’ does p

a better than average job; Ron

Eskin and Frank Rakas. holding.

the two other principal roles.
could have well fallen overboard.

There was a great deal of stiff-
ness, exageration, definite act-
ing, stunted projection, and even
some choppy non-verbal com-
munication that tended in some
instances to be just plain talking
rather than acting—the latter be-
ing very definite. ] wonder why,
if out to sea for so long, they were

so vibrant, so quick, and so lively? A

It was hard to convince myself
that they were so hungry after all.

Both Mark Huberman and Jeff
Boudov, alothough in minor roles,
were, in comparison, outstanding
in this little one act—that hardly
makes it.

THE VICTIMS

“Victims" is the second origin-
al work by Bert Nemitz to be pre-
sented by the Studio Theatre. It is
a wise choice — because in Mr.
Nemitz‘ latest effort there is the
mark of talent and understanding
that shows itself in a very worth-
while piece of theatre.

Perhaps one reason for the ob-
vious improvement in Nemitz‘
skill as a playwright is that he is
serious about his work. This is
very obvious. in that “Victims" is
well written. well structured, -and
very nicely mounted (Nemitz also
directs).

There is a gentle structure in _

which nothing sticks out or pokes
a finger at you. A continuity ex-
ists which lets one forget that this

is a play on stage and you can toy
with the idea of the real obvious
trials and tribulations of a possi-
ble, even probable, life situation.

Mood changes are quite effec-
tive, in most instances, with tran-
sition being smooth and unobstru-
sive.

Mr. Nemitz takes us into the

' lives of two people: one, a soldier.

and the other, a prisoner. whom
he guards somewhere during
World War I. There is strength

and subtle weakness . . . frustra-
tion and conflict . . . anger and
fate . . . that flash across the

stage carrying the audience right
along with swiftness and preci-
sion to an eventful climax.

Thomas Markham, except for
a few instances when his voice fell

* a little too low, was outstanding.

His performance is one of the
most consistently accurate char-
acterizations that I’ve seen at this
University during 1970.

David Schreib is only fair in his
first role, yet is no deterent to the
play itself. With Bert Nemitz’
fresh and totally entertaining new
work, coupled with Thomas Mark-
ham's exceptional performance-
the price of admission if fulfilled
twice over.

PICNIC ON THE BATTLEFIELD

"Picnic . .  is rather amusing
about war and the people that play
that game. In fact, there is a pic-
nic where mother and father vis-
it their son on the battlefield dur-
ing the action. It. unfortunately,
suffers not from Len Powleck's
direction, but from some of the
actors who seem to run away with
the whole idea.

Powlick directs both "Out of
Sea" and this one act, and appears
to have a nice command of those

   

skills needed to tie a production
together. I understand that he
had his share of probfems-—the
major one appearing to be from
some fresh actors and old veter-
ans who had gone astray.

Cases in point were Kenneth
Neal and to a lesser degree Betty
Rothbart. Kenneth ruins an amus-
ing portrayal by adlibbing (direct
contact with an audience mem-
ber) and by breaking the mood of
the play with some trite conversa-
tion with Miss Rothbart when the
record, player was in the wrong
position. He goes so broad that
it's almost as if he and his stage
wife are having their own little
private thing.

Miss Hobard is not quite as bad,
but joins Mr. Neal in over-draw-
ing a little too much in the wrong
places.

“Picnic . .  is the type of play
that can easily get silly. If not for
Jeff Boudov and Mark Huberman
the play could have fallen below
that level.

Rich Johnston and Thomas Da-
vey add to the comic element in
minor roles.

As a whole “Picnic on the Bat-
tlefield" is entertaining — and
should provide more than a few
chuckles for those present.

dents (AWS) committee appli-

I. The following is a-responsve to
the two letters’ in the Oct.» 9 .'

edition of (The.Pitt News)~' one

by Philip Manfred and the other
by ~«William> A. Johnston. III."
This is not'a defense of Marxism

but a criticism ofetwo particular

anti—marxists (which is certainly

something different).

The , Manfred letter was. I_
think‘. intended to be a criticism

_ of Cohen. but in that his criti-

<3‘,
. .

.’ .._ _’.

cisms_ were irrelevant to what
Cohen said. it didn't turnout
thatway. ‘ 1

The thrust of the first pgh.Vis
expressed by "Does Mr. Cohen

advocate Soviet or Chinese_ Mar-

xism as a suitable alternative to

"democracy?" ' Presumably < the
answer. is “Neither_"_since there ‘

are other alternatives. ‘Next Man-
fred points out that the Ameri-
'can worker is better off :than?
the "non-American worker.

The answertothis is “So what.

Should this prevent anybody from

tryingto make their situation bet-

Lter?-7' The next objections of

Manfreds are: 1.) The Soviet

.~ system. is intolerant of dissent.

The replyto this is the same

as .before: “This has nothing to

do with Cohen. even if we

grant“ (which we’ might not _want

to do):that Manfreds claims -are

'_ true." I felt a need to r.eply_to

Manfred's letter in that his sort.
of reasoning. is a common as it

is poor. The “Silent_Majority"

thrives on irrelevant" claims.

As regards Johnston's letter only
one. point need be rriade. He
asserts that  . Marxists have
endeavored to conspire to cast
black people ‘back into slavery. 
This is a puzzeling claim -in‘
that many ‘Marxists are black’.

-and I cannot .'figure out why ‘A
‘ they would want to. cast them- "
-selves back into slavery. V

_ Second. one wonders how
Johnston. knows that his asser-
tion is true.- Perhaps he has had
exclusive interviews with prom-

But it is more likely that John-

' ston is just another of the omni-

scient variety that we find so
plentiful these days. In closing he
offers to debate any New Racist

McDonough contradicts Himself
--Left Does Live In Dream World

The Editor,
_The Pitt News);

Sir:

I am replying to McDonough’s
letter in (The Pitt News) of Oc-
tober 5.

- He charges me with having
calledhim a Marxist and a mem-

' ber of SDS. This is astonishing,

-for I never said this. I was re-
plying not to.McDonough—I men-
tioned his name but twice—but to
an idea which he expressed; fur-
ther, I was primarily concerned
with the idea itself and not with
whether or not it was believed
by Mr. McDonough.

The idea was the , question
whether or not Marxists live in a
dream world. Donatelli affirmed
this. McDonough neither affirm-
ed it nor denied it, and I did not
say that he did either; I said only
that he objected to Donatelli’s
claim. But McDonough’s objec-
tion was of a peculiar type:
rather than affirm or deny this
question, he simply pointed out
what he thought was an incon-
sistency on the part of Dona-
telli. ’

 was my secondary purpose
tog.-Jargue that Donatelli was not

..;.in3;.gnsistent.

.“. . . the way to promote
rational discussion,” said
McDonough, “is not to call
o_ne’s opponents insane (or
accuse them of living in a
dream world). This, then,
“does not fit smoothly with
_ Donatelli’s expressed (?)
wish to ‘listen to other opin-
ions . . . ’ ” (The Pitt News,
Sept. 21)

Donatelli was not inconsistent
because his first claim—that the
left lives in a dream world—is
true. Now people who live in a
dream world are not rational, so
it is a waste of time to argue
with them (for argument is by de-
finistion .a rational enterprise).

Or if the supposed contradic-
tion; is formulated in terms of
insajnity—and this is clearly to be

Why waste time
waiting in line

taken in a popular rather than
clinical sense, for obviously neith-
er Donatelli nor I are competent
psychoanalysts—then the left
can be charged with insanity,
since this condition is character-
ized by the patient’s construction
of his own world, which is other
than the real world, if not in-
consistent with it. That is, insane
people are out of touch with re-
ality.

Again, one does not waste time
arguing with such people. But
however the supposed contradic-
tion is formulated, Donatelli can
be exculpated. To paraphrase
McDonough, I was defending one
individual, Donatelli, from the
irrelevant abuse of McDonough.

I reassert that the new left can
in some sense be characterized
as Marxist. This is quite consis-
tent with the fact that some
leftists are not Marxists in a strict
sense. The “in some sense” is
a qualifier, an escape hatch, and
McDonough, as a student of
philosophy, should be able ‘to
recognize such devices, for they
are fairly common in philoso-
phical literature. (He did notice
it, but he missed the point.)

There are many ways one can
“in some sense” be a Marxist.
Obvious cases (i.e., in a strict
sense) include the Marxist aca-
demic, journalist, or political
activist. But there are other
Marxist roles. Even many people
who are not generally thought of
as Marxists share important be-
liefs peculiar to Marxism, often
without realizing it.

One might say that Marxism
has infiltrated the . zeitgeist.
Compare, for example, some of
the ten points in the (Communist
Manifesto) with some of the
(New Deal) legislation or with
the rantings of many contempor-
ar.y liberals, ultraliberals, and
non-Marxist socialists and radi-
cals. As for the student left,
most of them are too ignorant or
lazy (or both) to be Marxists in
any strict sense, but you will find

them in radical left demonstra-
tions just the same, espousing
many Marxist ideas.

These people can all be called
Marxists “‘in some sense” be-
cause the definition of a Marx-
ist is somewhat loose. If, Mc-
Donough has a precise defini-
tion, I should like to hear it.

The fact that I lumped Mc-
Donough in with Cohen at the
end of my letter hardly entails
that I think that they_ have any
beliefs in common or that I
think that either or both of them
are members of SDS. 1 was sim-
ply trying to get a meaningful
dialogue going (and on a more
convenient basis than writing
letters to the editor).

Also, it hardly follows from the
fact that McDonough is ‘not a
Marxist.that a debate between us
would be dull. Although we.
might both agree that as a philo-
sopher Marx was an ass and a
half, I have a strong hunch that
we have some significant differ-
ences.

Finally; he contradicted him-
self in calling me ignorant and
ominscient. He also implicitely
contradicted himself in calling
me ignorant, and then taking
half a page of print to answer
me. As for omniscience, I readi-
ly admit that, and I appreciate
McDonough’s honesty; he is not
totally lacking in perception.

But he has badly misread my
letter, he has unjustifiably
charged someone with having
contradicted himself, he has
made unwarranted inferences
from what I did say, and he has
contradicted himself. I would
say that his inductive faculty suf-
fers from atrophy and his ima-
gination from elephantiasis, and
I politely suggest that he should
try to find a field less demanding
than philosophy. Perhaps he
could scrounge up a tin cup and
go to work for an organ grind-
er.

“Economics”
Hits War(iors)

Dear Editor:

I was amazed to read in (The
Pitt News) this week that anoth-
er march is being planned to
protest the war. After all these
years, it doesn’t occur to anyone
that the powers behind the war
don’t care about student dissatis-
faction, nor do they care wheth-
er the marchers miss dozens of
classes, whether because of poli-
tical marching ‘or simple boy-
cott. After all, is it creative,
thinking, well-educated people
who keep men of the Nixon-
Agnew genre in office?

I am reminded of a song about
the possibility of sometimes get-
ting what you need if you try,
even if you can’t always get
what you want. We need to get
the war ended, we want to be
listened to because we’re Ameri-
can citizens and we’re right.
Unfortunately, no one cares what
we want, so why not take some
steps to get what we need?

Instead of marching and writ-
ing to our Congressmen, why not
use the power that really rests
with the people. Stop supporting
the people who support the de--
cision-makers.

Cigarette makers, for instance.
Don’t buy from them. From any
of the American firms. Then
write to the heads of those com-
panies and tell them you’ll be
back when the war is over. If
every smoker who is anti-war
stops, and then just drops that
short note to those two or three
company presidents, there is a
pretty good chance they will be
in Washington within a week.
They’ll probably be pretty ex-
cited, too.

Furthermore, they wouldn’t
dare arrest you. At least I don’t
think they would.

New Mentors
Change Outlook

The Editor, The Pitt News:

There are many misconcep-
tions about the New Mentor
Program which are still rampant
on the campus as is evident by
the article by Nancy Reuther
entitled, “To Become A Pitt Wo-
man." The New Mentor Program

I is totally different from previousﬁ

years; this year (contrary to Mrs.
Reuther’s statement), the mentor
group is not a place where one
“learns of Lantern Night and oth-
er bits of knowledge essential to
successful campus life.” I

This year, the program’s em-
phasis has been “people”—just
a group of people getting togeth-
er and doing things together.
Some groups, have played foot-
ball and frisbie; some have visit-
ed the Inclines downtown; still
others have prepared and enjoy-
ed dinner together.

In our opinion, Mrs. Reuther
was not well informed about the
New Mentor Program; rather. 
she seemed to have based her“ "
article on her own mentor exper-
ience. It is a shame that the New
Mentor Program was not started
years ago.-It is open to the entire
university community, although
the majority of our participants
this year are freshmen.

Perhaps, Mrs. Reuther, you
would like to join our program,
and then you could write a sec-
ond article concerning our pro-
gram. If you or anyone else
would like to join, please come
to 507 S.U. We are always will-
ing to welcome new participants.

Insights for the Future

Taiwan--Trouble In 70’s?

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

Though the territorial integrity
of Taiwan must be maintained,
the quality of that independence
and its implications for Ameri-
can policy are not so easily de-
fined. .

That theme was one of the
most consistent ideas pervading
a discussion of Taiwan as a pro-
blem for U.S. foreign policy.
Part of a workshop on U.S. pol-
icy in Asia, the Monday after-
noon program featured the pre-
sentation of three desperate
views of Formosa.

Dr. Irwin Schulman, Dr. Ed-
ward Chen, and Dr. H. G. Liu
agreed that Taiwan must remain
a separate entity and not be for-
feited to mainland China, but
each offered a different prescrip-
tion for the independence of the
island nation.

Schulman, an Associate Profes-
sor of Political Science at the
University, said that though the
U.S. must honor its commitments
to Taiwan, we must simultane-
ously aim for a detente with
Communist China.

“We must recognize the Chin-
ese Communist government and
seat them in the United Nations,”
said Schulman, who feels that
the current policy-makers are
moving in that direction.

“It seems,” he stated, “that
the Nixon Administration wishes to
normalize relations with Com-
munist China. The Nixon Doc-
trine seems to suggest a retreat
from the policy of containment.”

Schulman believes that a maj-
or reassessment of Sino-American
relations underpins the new Chi-
na policy.

"The underlying assumption
seems to be that China is not a
threat to its neighbors because
of its limited capabilities and
intentions," he said.

Reduction of the American
military presence in Taiwan, be-
lieves Schulman. would help
close the Sino-American rift

and mitigate Chinese claims to
Taiwan.

 

  
     
     
     
   
    
    

   

“The likelihood of Communist
aggression will be reduced as the
visibility of the American pre-
sence in Taiwan is reduced.”

Terming any notion of an Am-
erican hands off policy toward
Taiwan “sheer hypocrisy,” Dr.
Chen likened the history of For-
mosa to a history of U.S. involve-
ment.

“The United States supplies all
of Taiwan’s arms," he said,
“but those same arms that are
given to fight Communists can
also be used to fight Formos-

99

ans

The Associate Professor of
International Relations at Bowl-
ing Green called upon the U.S.
to force the Nationalist Chinese
government to liberalize its re-
gime.

Citing a long list of excesses
allegedly perpetrated by Chiang
Kai-shek and his Kuomintang
party, including more than 20
years of constant martial law,
Chen called the Taipei. adminis-
tration “rule by the minority."

“There are 2,000,000 Chinese
making decisions for 12,000,000
native Formosans,” revealed
Chen. “In the National Assem-
bly, Formosans hold 32 seats,
while there are 1400 Chinese re-
presentatives. Furthermore, there
have been no Assembly elections
since 1949.”

Chen views a national plebes-
cite as the solution to indepen-
dent rule.

Dr. Liu blasted the idea of a
“Formosa for Formosans” move-
ment, calling it a “farce.”

“If this movement is valid,"
Liu told his audience at Crab-
tree Hall, “then every person

on earth should have his own
government."

Liu, an Assistant Professor of
Political Science at Point Park,
said that the cruelty and cor-
ruption of Chiang’s reign has
been greatly exaggerated. “All he
has done.” assured Dr. Liu, “has
been to put a few quislings i
jail.” -

According to Liu, the Kuom-
intang has absorbed the Formo-
sans into society while greatly
improving Taiwan’s
“In the past twenty years,” he
said, “the Chinese and the For-
mosans have lived together har-
moniously_, with a large number
of intermarriages. It is no uto-
pia, but it should be left to im-
prove on its own.’ ’

- Liu, displaying obvious emo-
tion, claimed that the affairs of
Taiwan are “none of America’s
business.”

“We are tired of American
policy makers sitting in their own
smoke-poluted rooms determining
whether to unleash Chiang or
leash Chiang. This is hardly,
self-determination.”

Dr. Liu. said that the best way
to settle the internal squabbles
of Taiwan was to “let Nature take
its course.”

EXHIBIT

Berniece H. Kent, pioneer col-
lector of Art Nouveau objects
and graphics, will speak on “Oh-
jects and Their Worls: Art Nou-
veau 1900" at 8 p.m. this even-
ing in the auditorium of the
Frick Fine Arts Building.

The exhibit, which includes
135 posters, watercolors and
drawings by turn-of-the-century
Belgian artists, will be at the
University from until November
6. ‘

Mrs. Kent, whose collection
ranges from pop art to valuable
antiques, such as a Baccarat
Winston Churchill paperweight,
considers Art Nouveau to be
one of the most imaginative
innovations in the history of de-
sign.

A resident of Cleveland, Mrs.
Kent travels widely in pursuit of
works of the Art Nouveau period,
as well as more modern pieces.
She is a frequent lecturer and
often augments her knowledge
with period costumes. She holds

The United States is fighting
an immoral and illegal war:

“The firing of one bullet over
someones property. by law. con-
stitutes a trespass; therefore. an
illegality. Also. the taking of a
life. according to the Old Testa-
ment. is an immorality; there-
fore. the Vietnamese war and
all other wars are immoral and,
illegal."

We are defoliating South Viet-
nam:

"South Vietnam is producing
three times as much rice now. as
compared to the production rate
before the U.S. involvement. In
addition. the jungle layers of the
south are in tiers three deep.

Many political prisoners are
thrown in jail by the Thieu
government without due-process
of law:

"Historically. the United States
has thrown people in prison with-
out due-process of law. Martial
law was once instituted by Pre-

Japanese-Americans were thrown

Atrocities are being committed

By JERRY MYERS

An air of excitement lingered
over the Panther training table
as the team members shuffled
back and forth around the cafe-
teria in the Graduate School of
Public Health.

The players seemed aware
that they had proved something
on Saturday afternoon with their
thundering comeback victory over
the West Virginia Mountaineers.
They had justified the confidence
that has characterized the Pan-
thers all year. but which came
under doubt after unimpressive
performances against schools like
Baylor. Kent State and Navy.

One particular part of the en-
tire squad that "put it all toge-

ther" on Saturday was the offen-

sive line. Guys like Bill Bein-

 

ecke. John Simpson. Bruce Har-
kiewicz. Dan Lynn and Bob
Kuziel showed that the Panthers
could run through people. and

continuously for almost thirty
minutes.

“Of course the backs helped
them with the 1 formation," of-
fensive line Coach Ernie Hefferle
said, relaxing after his Monday
night dinner. “The line did a
realgood job this game.”

Hefferles words.

"We did put it all together."
commented big right guard John
Simpson. "If everyone "stays cool
and doesn't lose control of them-
selves under the excitement. we
can play tough."

Simpson‘ felt that his confidence
was certainly justified, and the
West Virginia game clearly rein-
forced hisfeelings.

"I've always felt that we could «

win. The victory over WVL7 prov-
ed to the people that we could."

Coach Hefferle. a twelve year
veteran of Pitt football. was a
Panther coach on the 1963 squad
that finished third in the nation.
He talked about a thing called
‘third-down control.'

“We had the third down con-
trol for the entire second half
Saturday." Hefferle said. "When
you have that under control you
know that you're going to win.

j Of course. if the defense doesn't

hold. then school's out."

. Then the coach went on to
__make a very interesting compar-

.ison: .“the ’63 team had third-
_down control, and that’s why

this team reminds me a lot of
them.”

very interesting comments about '

the play of the Offensive line in

said. "Everybody got off the ball

Penn State Team. Easily, 19-1

By STEVE zvcn.

As the defensive corps of Frank Resciniti. Jan Korman. Bill
Haines and goalie George Hull held the f'ort.- the Pitt junior varsity
soccer team's offense bombarded the Penn State J. V. bastion for an
unbelievable total of nineteen goals while only giving up one Mon-

day.

Leading the brutal onslaught were sophomore Jorge Gutierrez.

who exploded for seven goals.
and freshman Tony Bolea. who
had four markers.

Also scoring f'or the cub boot-
ers were Abdul Almusallam.
Rich Euler. Bill Hauch. Bob Hull.
Jorge Maurer and Joe Testa.

The “B” team booters are now
4-1-1 after having lost their first
game 6-1 to tiny Davis-Elkins
College. '

Rookie coach Dick Slutzky.
who never played soccer. was
cited by the players as the main
reason why the team has done
so well this season despite a
poor showing the some poor
spirit during the exhibition gam-
es.

"Coach Slutzky brought this
team to life." noted co-captain
George Hull who plays goal.
"A lot of us were disgruntled and
upset because we didn't make the
varsity and felt playing for the
varsity wasn't really

    

should we try. Since Slutzky's
come we've developed pride and
teamwork. Why it was just beau-
tiful the way the guys played to-
gether today. "

Jorge Gutierrez, the co-cap-
tain and leading scorer, agreed
“Coach Slutzky has been the
difference, he said. “Before he
came we had little spirit on the
team. Now we not only have that
but a winning team.”

Jorge. a sophomore. also liked
the idea of playing more games
this year. "Last year we only
played two games. It was ridi-
culous. This year with seven
games on the schedule the guys
have had a chance to work to-
gether ‘ in competition where
you can't make a mistake that
wouldn't mean anything in a
scrimmage. Actual games bring
out the best in a soccer team and
this is. another reason why we
have been.

the makings of a really good of-
fense. and I think we put it all
together against West Virginia."

Outweighing the Mountaineers
approximately twenty pounds per
man, Lynn cited the quickness
of the WVU defense. “I'd rath-
er block a bigger; slower kid;
it’s easier to maintain a block
on him. A quicker guy can get
up and go around you.”

Miami is just that sort of team.
For the first time this season the’
Panthers will be up against a
team that can match them in
size. They will also have to con-
tend with a defense that has
featured six different formations
in the last two games. in con-
trast to a team like WVI’ which
featured only one or two.

“Miami will give you the even
look and the odd look." Hefferle
said. "West Virginia just lined
up with an even look. Now we'll
goover our plays and see which
ones will be effective against

the most amount of defenses. It's
a question of using a small amount
of plays which will be the most
effective."

. The weekly Lambert Trophy voting. which signifies_ Easie:

The Associated Press ranks the Panthers in their top
week. The AP pollsters say the Cats

squad in the nation, but the oth-

er major wire service, United
Press‘ International, doesn't list
Carl DePasqua’s team in their
voting’. »

West Virginia led the East last
week. and the loss to the Panth-
ers dropped the Mountaineers to
fourth place in the Lambert
count. Yale is third.

The Panther win boosted the
Cat record to 4-1 and they leap-
ed over Dartmouth in Lambert
polling. Last week the Ivy Leag-
uers. who are undefeated. held a
slight edge over Pitt.

DePasqua realizes that the rat-
ings don't make his job any eas-
ier during the rest of the season.

Softball Team’s Winning

by STEVE WILLIAMS

Mad House continued their win-
ning ways with a 12-8 victory
over Tower B rival Bud House.

John Pitrelli scored the win-
ning touchdown with only two min-
utes left in the game on a 10-yard
pass from quarterback Mark Ana-
tole. This winning touchdown was
set up by Jack Tighe's intercep-
tion of a Steve “Coach" Kocher-
zat pass on the midfield stripe.

The first Mad House touchdown
was also set-up by anintercepted
pass caught by Jerome Pigza. af-
ter only three minutes of play in
the first half.

Anatole passed five yards to
Steve Tritch for the initial score.
This followed a 40 yard comple-
tion to Mike Kohl, whichset up the

-score.

Bud House was in the game the
entire way. Trailing 6-0 they forg-
ed ahead into the lead on a 40 yard
run with an intercepted pass by
linebacker Steve Kocherzat.

John Wood kicked the two-point
conversion for an 8-6 Bud House
lead which they held at the half.

The Mad House defense was
highlighted by fearsome rush
from lineman Tom Williams and
Richard Heft. Jerome Pigza inter-
cepted two passes, one which led
to a touchdown and the second in
the waining minutes of the game
while Bud was driving for an ap-
parent winning touchdown. Steve
Sohinki also figured in the defense
which held the Bud attack in two
crucial second half drives.

last Saturday's football victory.
This is displayed by the Interna-
tional Students Association of
West Virginia who have invited
Pitt‘s foreign students soccer
team to Morgantown this Satur-

will be played on a home—and-
home basis with the Mountaineers
hosting the foreign Panthers this
year.

They aren‘t playing for the fun
of it: there is a trophy at stake.

There has been a trophy do-
nated by the West Virginia stu-
dents. This trophy will be kept by
the winner to be displayed in his
respective school. This trophy

will change hands next year if this

year's winner looses next year,
similar to the American cup in
boating.

There is going to be a party af-
ter the game that evening in which
the foreign students can talk and
make friends with some of their
own countrymen.

Women‘s sport contests at Pitt
are almost always overlooked by
Pitt sports fans. Though the wom-

winning teams. there is rarely
more than 15-20 people to wit-
