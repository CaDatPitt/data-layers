Soviet physicians

visit Pitt,

call for

nuclear test ban

By William Young
Staff Writer

Four ‘Soviet physicians arrived in
Pittsburgh this past Friday. They did
not come to discuss new medical
techniques or exchange medical in-
formation. They had something far
more important on their minds. -
nuclear war.

The Soviets are members of the ln-
ternational Physicians for the Preven-
tion of Nuclear War and are here to
try to promote peace. They believe
that their mission is necessary
because they know first-hand the hor-
rors of war as well as the effects of
a nuclear accident.

”We really want peace,” said Dr.
Yuri Lopukhin, the Sovietihead of
medical sciences and leader of the
group.”We hate war, and we know
what war is.”

The doctors said they are trying to
make it known that the Soviet Union
is making an honest attempt to seek
an immediate and bilateral morator-

ium on nuclear weapons testing with
the eventual elimination of the ex-
isting weapons.

Lopukhin believes that it is
America that does not wish to- be rid
of nuclear weapons due to its non-
compliance with Soviet test bans.

”After the Budapest Conference,”
Lopukhin said,”the IPPNW went to

Mr. Gorbachev and demanded an A

end to nuclear" bomb testing. Mr.
Gorbachev agreed and asked the
United States to do so, but President
Reagan refused.

”We have twice prolonged the
bomb moratorium, now until January

‘of 1987, but still you have not

agreed. We would like to liquidate

’ all nuclear weapons by the year

2000,” Lopukhin continued. .
Lopukhin claimed that President
Reagan is so unwilling to come to
terms regarding nuclear weapons that
he did not make public Gorbachev’s
latest proposal on limiting nuclear
weapon_s. According to Lopukhin the
newest proposal would immediate-
ly stop testing of nuclear weapons,

prohibit the manufacture or invention
of any more nuclear weapons and
stop the production of all kinds of
chemical and biological weapons.
Lopukhin said that he cannot
understand U.S. reluctance to agree
on a moratorium. He noted that after
the initial test-ban proposal had been
made by Gorbachev, the United
States set up a Seismology center in
central Asia to monitor Soviet testing.

On Wednesday, Sept. 17, a
Penn State student visiting some
friends at Pitt was assaulted by
several males.

The student, who asked to re-
main nameless, sustained lacera-
tions, contusions and a possible
broken jaw, according to a city

police report.

The victim was walking to his
car, which was parked in the
3400 block of Euler Way, around
11 p.m. when one assailant
placed the victim in a headlock.

At this time, a second assailant
started to hit the victim in the face.
The student was asked for his
money but informed the attackers
that he had none. He even went
as far as to show the agressors his

wallet. At this point, the other at-
tackers proceeded to beat on the
victim with their fists, feet and a
2x4 board.

The victim was released from
Presbyterian-University Hospital
on Saturday, Sept. 20.

The city police officers, who
would be responsible for in-
vestigating an assault such as this
could not be reached for an
update.

Lopukhin also said that the problem
is worldwide and affects every
nation.

”The number of nuclear weapons
is enough to destroy our planet com-
pletely,” Lopukhin said. ”We can

either develop and modernize,

nuclear weapons, or we can stop
them. This situation is very com-
plicated as there is no guarantee that
this weapon can be used occa-

sionally.

”|t’s enough to think that some‘
crazy man can start a war and destroy , 
.humanity and civilization. Unfor-. ..
tunately, not many people under“-Bi,
stand this. lfanuclear war breaks out .' .

there will be no safe places.”

”We are old,” Lopukhin said, refer- . 
ring to his fellow physicians,”but you _, 
are young. How you can live with ~ 

this situation I don't know.”

Socialism vs.

Capitalism:
Pitt profs debate

political philosophies

By Christopher Capra
and-

T Jack Burkman

Sta ff Writers

Capitalism versus socialism was the
theme of debate between two Pitt
professors at David Lawrence Hall
Thursday night.

The debate pitted historian Julius
Rubin, an advocate ofcapitalism,
against economist David Houston, a
proponent of socialism.

Both speakers summarized their
points of view almost at the onset of
their presentations. Rubin spoke first,
stating that capitalism is a ’’social
system which encourages individu-
alism” and a‘ ”private sphere in
which government cannot interfere.

”The private sphere,” he said,”is
maintained not by laws, but rather by
the popular belief in its necessity.
Destruction of the privatesphere
hurts everyone.”

Whereas capitalism is sustained by
public confidence, Rubin said that
socialism is maintained by govern-
mental authority, and that socialist
governments run the risk of being
totalitarian.

”When socialists acheive social
justice,” said Rubin,”they destroy the
private sphere, thus destroying in-
dividualism. When you put social
justice first, you run a dangerous risk
of government interference.

The rebuttal periods were in clear
opposition to Rubin’s ideas. One
man, who identified himself as a
worker, and a Black, called Rubin
one of the"’bourgeois privileged,”
and called capitalism, ”an evil, op-

pressive force.”
A woman said,

ments as totalitarian, ”How can you
say those governments are repressive
when there existed Haiti under’

Duvallier; Iran under The Shah; and").
the,Phi||ipines under Marcos, all-‘A’
brutally repressive and all supported 
by the United States, the capitalist ‘

government?”

Houston, who spoke second, saw 
socialism in a much different light?

than Rubin. He responded to Rubin’s
ideas, and said that, ”The impulse to

socialism is derived from the ex-Y‘. if
istence of and the problems of‘,

capitalism‘; socialism is a response to
capitalism. -

”The way to understand socialism"
is by seeing that it is historically pro-.

duced. It is not a vague ideal, it is -.f._

concrete life. Each attempt at

socialism is an attempt to change the

present capitalist situation.” .
Houston said capitalism, for the

most part, has failed to deal ade-..-

quately with many of-today's prob-
lems, namely the unequal
distribution of resources.

About Rubin’s idea of capitalism  

and individualism, Houston retorted,
’’It is one thing to talk about in-
dividuality, it is another thing to ac-
tually see it.”

The debate was part of a three-part 4' L F

forum being presented by The.

Socialist Education Collective. The re-_ ' I

mainingtwo debates concern ”De-
industrialization, class conflict and
the future of the American Steel in—.
dustry,” and ”Marxism and Chris-

tianity””upcoming Friday, November_ '

21 and Friday, December 12.

PARIS — French authorities
reported no progress in attempts to
catch terrorists responsible for the five
-bombings over a 10-day period,
beginning Sept. 8.

The bombings resulted in the
deaths of eight people and injury to
150 others and threw a cloud of ten-

i sion over the French capital.

Police remain on nationwide alert
with extra officers patrolling the Paris
streets and increased vigilance at
French ports and airports.

According to British newspapers,
London's elite anti-terror squad is on
stand-by should the French request
assistance. This unprecedented offer
was reportedly made during high-
level talks between London and Paris
last week.

A Paris police spokesman said that
there have been noattacks since
Wednesday, possibly indicating that
increased security measures are
working. ,

Meanwhile, an Arab group claim-
ing responsibility for the bombings
threatened to expand their campaign
to Italy if three Middle-Eastern
prisoners were not released from
French jails.

BRONX, New York — Philippine

  Black Heritage
Pittsburgh Courier photographer
depicts 40 years of ”living history”

By Milt Klopfer

For The Pitt News

There is an old saying that a pic-
ture is worth a thousand words. So
what price can be placed on 40,000
pictures?

Charles Harris, a photographer for
over 40 years, must have some idea,
for he has taken just that amount.

”l’ve seen people standing [in front
of _a photograph] and crying,” he
said. ’’It must bring back a lot of
memorIes.”

The Pitt black studies department
recently acquired a collection of his
photographs depicting black life in
the Pittsburgh area from the '30s to
the mid '70s. .

According to Dennis Morgan,
founder of Pittsburgh's Blackheritage
Foundation, the collection is ”one of
the greatest finds in black history.”

Pittsburgh's Blackheritage Founda-
tion is a movement devoted to the
creation and preservation of positive
images in the black community.

Black studies professor Rollo
Turner, who documents and ensures
the safety of the collection, said the
collection is significant in that it is the
most complete documentation
through photographs of a black com-
munity anywhere.

But, according to Turner, there is
more than just the -purely historical
value of the photographs to take in-
to account. "The photographs pro-
vide information and a link between
generations," said Turner. ”They are
not just people who are dead hang-
ing on a wall, [the photographs] bring

joy and a lot of fond memories.”

Harris, now 78 and living in
Homewood, did his work for the
Pittsburgh Courier. To him, his work
reflects no great messages, but rather,
”just the love of what I did.”

He is equally unimpressed with the
celebrities he has met and
photographed (Lena Horne, Billy
Ekstine, Count Basie and Joe Lewis
to name a few). ”They didn’t phase
me. To the Pittsburgh Courier they
were big. To me they were just other
guys to photograph.” He added,
however, that he and Lena Horne
became very close.

Though it has taken many years to
be publicly recognized for his work
in photography, Harris does not seem
disappointed. ’’It just feels good that

.l’m alive and that I have my health,”
he said. ‘

Harris said it does make him feel
good to see his photographs get
positive responses, however.

To build up further interest in the
collection, _Harris, Turner and
Morgan have organized an exhibit of
some of Harris’ work. The exhibit is
entitled ”Blacks from the East”, and
concentrates primarily on the
photographs of locations, people and
events in areas east of the Hill
District. It is being held at the
Kingsley Center in East Liberty until
Sept. 27.

Delores Johnson, a secretary and
word processor at Pitt's news and
publications department, recently
visited the exhibit. She came to the
exhibit out of curiosity and was
suprised when she saw her sister in

one of the photographs. ‘'1 was just
getting ready to leave, when I looked
and there was my sister,” she said.

The photograph showed her sister
at the groundbreaking for the Faith
Lutheran Church School on York
Avenue in the Hill District.

After looking further, she found an
earlier photograph from 1946 of a
class in front of the old Faith Lutheran
Church School which stood on the
corner of Webster and Heron
Avenues. '

In the front row, second from the
left, was Delores Johnson. In the
same row at the right end was her
brother Eddie. In the second row,
third from the left, was her brother
Robert, and in the fifth row at the
right end was her sister Shirley.

Johnson purchased a copy of the
picture as well as the photograph of
the groundbreaking. ’’I cherish this,”
Johnson said of the photograph.

According to Morgan, responses
like Johnson's were common once
Harris’s work went on exhibit. To
him, as well as to Turner, Harris and
Johnson, the photographs are ”living
history” — links between the once‘
remote past and the present.

Persons interested in seeing the ex-
hibit can visit the Kingsley Center at
6618 Penn Circle South, Mondays
1 1 :30 a.m.-6 p.m., Tuesdays through

‘Fridays 11:30 a.m.-8 p.m., Saturdays

from 1-8 p.m. and Sundays from 1-5
pm.

Persons interested in the collection
itself can contact Rollo Turner at the
black studies, department.

Robertson: A it

 sign from God?

i As_inost of you know, there's going to be a presidential election
in two short years. Anyone who watches the news or reads the
newspapers knows that presidential hopefuls are already gearing up
to do battle. The election is two years away, and we already have
a good idea of who the candidates will be. Most of the names in this
group come as no surprise. However, there's one name on that list

,_that is shocking. That name being the Reverend Pat Robertson.

‘He's making serious gains in this pre-election scramble. A man who

' V . was once considered a political joke is starting to gain respect. He

Claims that the support he's won is from the majority of Americans
who are fed up with our ”Godless society” and who want to return
this nation to "God’s favor.” Surely, the majority in this country can-
not take seriously a man who points to women's liberation and the
teaching of evolution as signs of our moral decay. How can anyone
take seriously a man who claims to have the power to change the
weather, to have been chosen by God to be the next president and
who frankly admits that he will ignore Supreme Court rulings with
which he disagrees? Can you imagine a faith healer in the Oval Of-
fice? Please say no and wake up. This man is gaining more support
everyday, and not because of the sheer numbers of people who
believe in him, it's more likely the sheer numbers who are too
apathetic to do anything to stop him.

Many people are distressed over the current administration's sup-
posed lack of progress as far as women's rights go. If Reverend Robert-
son, by some c-hance, actually makes it to the White House, ladies
get your aprons ready. The progress made by women over the last
60 years is likely to go the way of the rest of the progressive reforms
we've made, most of which Robertson cites as signs of moral depravi-
ty. Say goodbye to birth control rights, separation of church and state,
and freedom of expression.

The election is two years away. Get involved before it's too late.
Pat Robertson is a sign —" sign that Americans need to take politics
seriously to prevent a tragedy.

An excellent idea

Nominations are now being accepted for the Fourth Annual
Chancellor's Distinguished Teaching Award. These are the only
campus~wide awards for teaching excellence given by the universi-
ty, and you, as students, have a voice in this matter. Student organiza-
tions and groups of five or more students can nominate the faculty
member of their choice.

This is an opportunity to acknowledge a certain professor or in-
structor whom you feel is an excellent educator. The fact that you,
as students, can nominate candidates is an important advance because
you are the ones who benefit from a good instructor.

Don't let this opportunity pass. Participate in the nominations. You'll
be helping to acknowledge good educators and to better the quality
of education at Pitt.

Some may say that this is little more than a popularity contest. Some
may think that only the instructors that students like will be
nominated, regardless of their qualifications. This is not the case. The
board who oversees the nominations plans to conduct in-depth in-
terviews and what amounts to be an investigation to see how qualified
the nominees are.

The fact that faculty members themselves can nominate their col-
leagues, too, should alleviate misconceptions regarding the legitimacy
of the awards.

It is vital that students exercise their right to a voice in this matter.
People are forever lamenting the fact that they have no voice in univer-
sity matters. These nominations are a fantastic way to eliminate that
sentiment also.

It would be great if all of the student groups on campus would par-
ticipate, but if you're not a member of any groups, don't let that stop
you, either. Get together with five of your friends, write a 500-word
essay on your favorite professor and be active at Pitt. For further in-
formation, go to the Office of Faculty Development at 3600 CL. Make
a difference in the quality of your education — get involved.

Misconceptions

Mr. Churchill's article concerning
his adventures in Alaska was quite
entertaining, but lwas surprised to
read of his change of major from
political science to economics. After
his plethora ofdrunken Indian stories
and sweeping generalizations about
native Alaskans, I thought he might
choose to grace the sociology or an-
thropology departments with his
fresh insights. ,

We are told that all Alaskan Indians
have a racially low tolerance for
alcohol and several paragraphs later
that all Indians are alcoholics. He also
informs us that Eskimos (or more pro-
perly, Inuits) can withstand ”tremen-
dous cold," implicitly unlike the
more ”civi|ized” types from the
lower 48. .

I imagine that Mr. Churchill gained
these stereotypical insights from his
knowledgeable new friends, most of
whom — he says —- were "on the run
from the law” and as new to the state
as he was. I would like to know how
often he discussed his impressions
with the people in question? But

LETTERS

perhaps there just weren't any In-
dians around who were sober
enough to hold a conversation with.

I can't wait for Mr. Churchill's next -

trip. Maybe we'll learn that Africans
(the native peoples, not the white col-
onizers, of course!) are predisposed
to athletics and loud music, or how
all of the Jews he saw in Israel/were
rich and had big noses. ‘

In the meantime, if I ever have the
chance to meet Mr. Churchill, I'll be
sure to offer him some cheap wine
and then roll around on the ground
and howlso that he'll know a native
American when he sees one. I think
Mr. Churchill and The Pitt News both

- owe all Indians an apology.

Bicentennial blues

I am a sophomore here at the
university, and I have always wanted
to attend this supposed[ly] great
school of higher education. I have
heard friends who have graduated
talk about how the students were up-
most on the university's priority list.
What happened? Were these people
brainwashed, or am I having a bad
dream? Here it is, the bicentennial of
the university, and I feel as much in-

volved in it as the dead tree planted '

in the Cathedral Lawn.

Everything I see is administrative in
regard to the university's birthday. I
feel as though this is just another nor-
mal year, and I could care less about
the bicentennial. It makes me sick
when I walk around and see banners
hanging along the streets, new grass,
shrubs and trees on the Cathedral
Lawn, and new windows in only
parts of some of the dorms. Why?
Because I helped pay for all of this,
and lam not involved [nor do I] feel
a part of it. What happens when Pitt
is done collecting [its] birthday
money? Are the students going to get
the rest of the windows in the dorms,
new plumbing for all of the pipes that
break in the dorms or lower tuition
per chance? No, of course not! In this
case I hope Pitt receives nothing for
what is supposed to be a school of
higher education because I know that
the students won't receive anything
from it anyway. The university has
the nerve to deny the Greeks their
fund raiser because the students
won't see any of the money. If this
is the case, the bicentennial as a fund

raiser serves no true purpose either!
Happy birthday Pitt —— I hope

you're happy about your progress. , .

Weekend War Zone

So what's the problem? Why is it
that my friends and I can no longer
feel safe on Oakland streets? I'm
speaking primarily of the weekend
war zone, the area on Forbes
[Avenue] running in front of Priman-
ti's and The "O.” Things are really
getting ugly out there.

The other night I was walking
down Forbes with three friends. We
were minding our own business.
Some guy walked up and made an
obscene comment. We ignored him.

We walked further down the street, ,

maybe four feet. Another guy
grabbed one of my friends by the
arm. She asked him what he wanted.
He replied with an obscene com-
ment. As we walked, more obscene
comments were yelled at us.

I thought to myself that this was ab-
surd that we must put up with this
kind of harrassment. But what are we
supposed to do? The local police do
not seem to be having much luck
controlling the streets.

I am not a prejudiced person. But
facts are facts; the majority of the peo-
ple loitering on the streets are black.
Why?

Is there a reason? I mean, if I think
of how I'd like to spend a Saturday
night, I can assure you that it's not
hanging out in front of the ”O" har-
rassing people.

It seems so senseless. There are
things to do on weekend nights — go
to a bar, go dancing, go to a concert.
And if you're not 21, then go see a

movie or something. And ifyou're in ,

high school, it's not, as you may
think, cool to hang out on the streets.

Blacks and whites can get along.
Believe me, I've seen it. But problems
with prejudices are never going to be
resolved in this current, tense at-

mosphere.

THE‘ PITT NEWS, Monday, September 22, 1986

Japanese business:

In recent weeks I have had three
different dealings with businesspeo-
ple from Japan. In each case, the
nature of the dealings has left me
confused.

In the first case, a woman from
Japan had written me about a pro-
posed business transaction. I was
swamped by mail at the time I re-
ceived her letter, and I neglected to
answer her. Several weeks later
another envelope arrived from her;
I opened it expecting her to chastise
me for not writing her back.

Instead, here was the salutation and
first paragraph of her letter:

"Dear Bob Greene —— _

”When I wrote to you last and
posted that letter, it struck me to
realize how bold and stupid to make
such an application directly to you.
It was quite natural for you to ignore
it. I wish to apologize for my being
rude, ignorant and bothering you so
much."

In the second case, I was involved
in a minor dispute over payment for
a project that I had sold to a Japanese
publisher. I received a letter from a
representative of the publisher. Here
in part is what the letter said:

"My associate has asked me again
to tell you of his regrets at the mis-

Q. I'm 64 and live with my wife
and girlfriend in a menage. We get
on fine. I also have at least two girls
on the side. With all this going on,
I am wondering — does a man my
age have to worry about the fertility
of his sperm? _ .

A. Charlie Chaplin became a dad-
dy in his 805. So don't be an irrespon-
sible kid and throw out all your
contraceptives. Not unless all your
girlfriends are past menopause.

Q. You know what the housing
problem is. Our solution was to share
a pad — strictly as rent-sharers, no
sex. One night she has the bed, I
have the couch; next night, switch.
The trouble is, people keep kidding
us about our sex life and ask how
come we both date other people —
aren't we scared of infection, aren't
we jealous, etc.

A. People are born curious. Also,
they're born teasers. Teasing has its
place in life, even if it hits on nerves
sometimes. You can cool people off
about this by not reacting. Just say,
smiling, playfully, ”None of your
business.” That can't make anyone
mad or angry, and still it does remind
them that it really isn't their business.
Let me ask you this: If you switch
beds like that every night, do you
keep switching the sheets, too? I
know — none of my business.

understanding which occurred over
the contract. He likened the two of
you to a young couple in love and
wanting to marry being thwarted by
meddlesome country relatives
demanding things their way with no
care for the desires of the couple!”

In the third case I was visited in
Chicago by three men who represent-
ed a Japanese company. We spent
the better part of two days together,
and we had many drinks and meals
in each others’ company. Every time
I would try to pick up the check, or
at least pay for my share, one of the
Japanese visitors would hold up his
hand and say, ” Please!” He'would
then pull a wad of money out of his
pocket and say, with a smile, "Bank
of Tokyo.”

These three examples were the op-
posite of how I would expect things
to go in American business dealings.
In the case of the woman who called
herself "bold," "stupid," "rude” and
”ignorant" for having written me, I
would have expected an American to
bawl me out for having failed to write
back. In the case of the misunder-
standing-over the contract, in the
United States I would have expected
to receive a document full of stem
legaljargon, not a nice letter about

—year—old

Q. I have gone with the same guy
eight years, since I was 17, and now
we are going to get married. I never
had sex with anyone else, and I regret
that. Before I go into this for life,
shouldn't I have the experience of sex
with someone else? At least one
other guy? One reason I ask you is
that I even feel guilty wanting
another experience because he keeps
saying he's glad I have had no other
men.

A. It is a fact that we can feel guil-‘

ty about breaking eggs or throwing
out old matches unused. Your regret
is nothing to be guilty about, but
don't tell him. He doesn't have to
hear from you about that. Now‘-
should you have sexual experience
with other men before you marry?
No. It could do great damage to your
marriage to this man who values you.

Perhaps there really is a sacrifice on
your part here. It is one well worth
making for the price of a good,
lifelong relationship. Be mature about
this. That means knowing what you
want and paying for it. Ifyou are not
ready forthat payment, you are not
ready to marry.

Q. I feel like a freak because I am
the only girl I know who has never
been asked on a date. Guys pay no
attention to me. I seem to be invisi-
ble in classrooms at high school, in

 

no ENE

a "young couple in love.” And in the
case of the three visiting Japanese
men, in America I would have ex-
pected to be allowed to pick up at
least some of the checks.

To look into this I contacted Pro-
fessor Hiroki Kato of Northwestern
University, an expert on cross-
cultural dealings between Americans
and Japanese.

"Japanese businesspeople appear
to be much more polite than Amer-
ican businesspeople," Kato said. "But
the question is, are they really as
polite as they seem?

groups on the street, everywhere. I ’m
kinda pretty, too. What is this?

A.‘You are not alone. I hear this
story every day from other girls and
women. And, let me say, I know one
case where the husband is mad at his
wife for feeling that way. He says it
shows her own low self-esteem, and
she ignores men who like her — in-
cluding him. a

The" woman who has this idea
stuck in her head often refuses to
acknowledge attention from men.
Men who do like her and don't
count. I also know that some girls
blossom after high school, when‘ they

 

"In the case of the woman who
wrote you the apologetic letter, you
must know that in Japan, offering an
apology is not a sign of weakness. In
the United states, it is often thought
to show weakness. A Japanese per-
son is not necessarily humbling him-
self or herself by apologizing. And
humility itself is seen as a strength,
not a weakness. So there is nothing

' unusual about that woman's letter.

"In the case of the letter about the
contract misunderstanding, the thing
to remember is that in Japan, there
is no such thing as a time for business
and a time for personal feelings. They
become the same. So for the person

to refer to your business dealings as _

analogous to a "young couple in
love’’ is not as out of line as it might
seem. Allegories like that are quite
common, although they would be
avoided by sophisticated people in
the American culture. Often Japanese
businesspeople will make up a story
or quote a line from Shakespeare dur-
ing very serious business negotia-
tions. It softens the impact of the
message, and it is not considered a
sign of giving in.

"In the case of the three Japanese
visitors who would not let you pay
for anything, this too is quite com-

become

go to college or to work. The cam-
pus and the workplace are terrific
places to meet men, and, it seems,
to be seen in a whole new way.
So — there are two thoughts for
you, and here is a third. Don't count
on men to initiate an acquaintance.
Do take responsibility for that. If you
are shy or awkward about the first
conversations with a new person,
there is a good book about asser-
tiveness and managing talk and rela-
tionships. It's called, Don't Say Yes
When You Mean to Say No by
Herbert Fensterheim. Get yourself a

copy. "

Q. The wife and I have a basically
good sex life but sometimes I leave
her unsatisfied. She has an orgasm
but seems to want more. I don't
mean just being held during her
resolution period, after her climax,
either.

A. Some women need more than
one orgasm. It is not a case of being

. ungrateful or of all the other women

being wimps for not wanting more.
It's an individual thing, like always
liking coffee with milk, no sugar. You
might consider giving her an orgasm

before you commence intercourse,~

and then one afterwards. Sometimes,
for the last event, you might hold her
while she pleasures herself. I am not
suggesting something new or out-

Yet another proposition for student

What is this Proposition 48 that the
NCAA has started up? A bad idea
with good intentions or a good idea
with good intentions? True, if one
looks at it, it appears to have the best
interests of the athletes in mind, but
does it really? With a bylaw such as
this, one can't take it at face value,
one must see what its effects are.

The results of this rule are such that
all athletes playing Division I varsity
sports must meet minimum entrance
exam scores as well as obtain at least
a C average in 11 core curriculum
classes. The NCAA would have us
believe that they have the athlete's
best intentions in mind and not the
fact that they are trying to find a way
to minimize the chances of a scan-
dal occurring that would further
blacken their record.

The NCAA is acting very shrewd-

I ly by making this ruling. They realize

that Division I sports are big money
activities and reach nearly every
home in America in some way or
another, so they are minimizing the
chances that a problem with an

athlete or a team will blemish the
realm ofcollege sports. This is done
by making any person who wishes to
compete in Division I sports meet
certain academic standards or else
they are not allowed to play. This
means a person with athletic_prowess
must either sit the year out or move
down into a lower division where, if
a problem were to develop, it would
go primarily unnoticed due to the
low amount of publicity that lesser
divisions attract.

This, in the long run, benefits

neither school nor athlete. A school,

which is forced to have several of its
star athletes sit out a season is bound
to have a less than admirable season.
This results in lower returns from the
box office, a primary source of in-
come for many universities. A school
that is unable to pull money from its
sports profits to account for teacher
salary increases and other expen-
ditures will be forced to increase tui-
tion by a greater amount than it has
already planned. This has a tenden-
cy not to please the people who find

. WILL
YOUNG

themselves paying the tuition —- the
students. . i

It doesn't benefit the athlete either.
A person — whose sole reason for be-
ing in college is to play college-level
sports, yet who can't meet the
qualifications -— must sit out a year
or move down. This doesn't benefit
the athlete in one of two ways. Either
he forfeits a valuable year of playing
experience by being forced to sit in
his room and brush up on poly-
nomial division, or he moves down
to a smaller division. If he opts to play
in Division II, he forfeits the exposure
he could have gained playing at a
larger school and must be content
with the minor leagues.

The athletes this affects most,
however, are those who are attending
college with the hopes of making it
into the pros. A person whose sole.

ambition is to play for the Cavaliers
is more concerned with practice and
play than with his ability to factor an
algebra equation. The NCAA, by
sticking its nose into academics, may
have seriously hurt the athlete's abili-
ty to be recruited by the big leagues
because he hasn't had the experience
he could have had if he wasn't forced
to take classes that had nothing to do
with his major: professional sports.
This is the problem at hand; it
seems the NCAA wants to pretend
that it doesn't know that many
athletes’ sole intention after leaving
college is to enter professional sports,
not to obtain a degree in business
management. The NCAA would have
done better to suggest that all Divi-
sion I schools either abide by bylaw
51] (Proposition 48) or institute a new
major called professional sports.
A major along this lines would
separate people who want to major
in a normal field and play sports from

those who want to make a career in

pros. Those athletes opting for this
major would be required to play a.

Pat admits he was lucky. He saw
that it was only a matter of time
before he would become snared in
his own -web of lies and did
something before that happened.
_ Five months ago, as he was prepar-

Pat told his wife of three years and
his family (neither of which knew of
his alcoholism) of his problem, and
they sought help. ,
Traditionally there have been two

THE PITT NEWS

Shot Down  

Defense dominate

By Bob Travers

Sports Editor

West Lafayette, Ind. — Like Laurel
needed Hardy, like Simon needed
Garfunkel, like Donny needed Marie,
like peanut butter needed jelly, Pitt
neededa win. Pitt really needed a
win.

The Pitt football team roared to its
first victory of the 1986 season Satur-
day afternoon as they came back
from a 14-point deficit early in the
first quarter to beat the Purdue Boiler-
makers 41-26.

Pitt's defensive line was the key to
the game, holding Purdue to an em-
barrassing minus 43 yards rushing.
Purdue had only two backs who
gained anything at all — James
Medlock, 22 yards on seven carries,
and Jerry Chaney, two yards on six
carries. ,

"It feels really good to get a win,”
defensive tackle Lorenzo Freeman
said after the game. "We came out
sluggish, but defensively, we got our
stuff together and were able to get the
win.”

To describe the way the Panthers
played in the first five minutes of the
game as "sluggish" is to be more
than charitable.

Quite simply, the Panthers stunk ,

worse than Purdue Farms on a wind-
y day. , V

"The national anthem's hardly over
and we're down 14-0," Mike Gott-
fried said. "I thought if we'd just stay
with our plan, we'd come back.”

On Pitt's first possession of the
game, Purdue blocked John Rasp’s
punt at the 32-yard line. Four plays
later Purdue quarterback Jeff George
threw a perfect touchdown pass to
Lance Scheib.

After taking the ensuing kickoff,
John Congemi threw an interception
on the first play and Purdue had the
ball on the Pitt 24. A few more plays
and George again found Scheib wide
open in the end zone. Purdue had a
14-0 lead only 4:10 into the game.

"We were down 14-0 and that's
tough on any team,” Congemi said.
”But especially when you're on the
road. It was gut-check time for us.
I played as badly as I could've played
for two series. It's like spotting them
points."

Pitt began its comeback on the next
series. Congemi mastered a 79-yard,
14-play drive that culminated with
Craig Heyward diving into the end
zone on a fourth-and-one play. ‘

''I tried to wipe out what I did ear-
ly," Congemi said. ’’I don't know
why I did it [played poorly], but I did,
so I just had to come out and play
better. We were down 14-0 and I
said, ’I'm better than this.’ So then I
just went out and started having fun."

Congemi wasn't the only one hav-
ing fun on Saturday.

Defensive back Gary Richard had I

two interceptions — George threw
five total — and returned one of them
49 yards down the sideline for Pitt's
final touchdown.

Defensive end Tony Woods, Pitt's
highly touted All-America candidate,
finally had an All-America-type day,
sacking George twice for 23vyard(s
and getting credit for six tackles. It
was particularly the relentless
pressure of Woods and Freeman that
caused George to throw so many bad
passes.

"We felt like we could put a lot of
pressure on him [George], and we
did,” Woods said. "I felt like this was
my best game of the year.”

I Dirk oufmo/The Pitt News

Tony Woods (90) and Steve Apke (50) were the leading
tacklers‘ in Pitt's 41-26 victory over Purdue.

West Lafayette, lN—Welcome .toL- 

college football, Jeff George.

The freshman George, a heralded I

quarterback out of Indianapolis’ War-

ren Central High School, got his first . ._ 
taste of what it is like to be the '_,
quarterback at a second division Big 

Ten school.
It is not a pretty job, but as Jim_

Everett once said, somebody has to ' ’ I

do it. Everett, by the way, is only a-
few days away from signing a multi-

million dollar contract with the Los .

Angeles Rams. .

It is Everett's shoes that George is I 

trying to fill at present. Last season

Everett became Purdue's third . 
leading passer of all time. Later, 

George will be compared to Len
Dawson, Bob Griese, Mike Phipps,

Scott Cambell and Mark Herrmann. f 
The line of great Purdue quarterbacks  T
is a long one, and while Georgecer-,  .
tainly seems to have the physical ; 
‘tools to be among the best, he has a A  .

long way to go.

Hetwill first have to overcome the ‘ I ;
fact that he is playing for Purdue. The ' jg , 

Boilermakers are not what they once‘
were. In the past four years and two

games Purdue is 19-27-1 and has _ 

posted only one winning season dur-

ing that span. In 1984 Purdue was 7-5 cl

and earned a trip to the Peach Bowl.

after quarterbacks in the Midwest last

spring, elected to pass up the

glamour and Rose Bowl trips of such. _  -.

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — It's been
a rough year for Chuck Klausing.

Even after Saturday's convincing
victory over Purdue he stood outside

the Panther locker room looking’

defeated. ,

Linebacker coach Sal Sunseri came
by and offered congratulations, but
they went unnoticed by Klausing.

"Yeah," Klausing said as he stared
at the pavement. "You did a good job
on your end. I wish I could have held
up mine."

Lady Panthers fin

By Kelley Butt

Sta ff Writer

The Lady Panther volleyball team
had several goals to accomplish go-
ing into the Pitt Classic. They needed
to win both Big East matches with
Georgetown and Villanova, and they
did. Pitt also wanted to hold their
own against Santa Barbara. They did
so quite impressively, gaining one
game off of the 7th ranked Lady
Gauchos.

Coach Collier noted that the Lady
Panthers started the tournament a lit-
tle sluggishly. "We opened against
Villanova and played very poorly. It's
difficult to play when you're not as"
emotionally prepared as you should
be. It was a tough match for us to
play. We were looking ahead to the

It certainly wasn't the kicking game
that upset Klausing. Jeff VanHorne
was five for five an extra points and
had two field goals of 47 and 35
yards.

So ended the kicking controversy.

Klausing was apparently disap-
pointed Qver_two blocked punts. The
first occurred on the first series of the
game when free safety Nat Martin
came across and blocked the punt
allowing Purdue to start its first series
on the Pitt 24-yard line.

Purdue scored four plays later, on-
ly 3:20 into the game. Things looked
even worse after Congemi threw an

rematch with Santa Barbara. We
knew that it would make ViIlanova's
whole season to beat us, but we held
on to win three games to one game."
Pitt once again matched skills with
Santa Barbara. The Lady Panthers
were much more prepared for this
series. Senior captain Sue Hoover
stated,"You tend.to make the digs
that you've never dug before because
you are so motivated. When we in-
itially played Santa Barbara, we were
excited at the prospect of playing and
possibly beating a team from Califor-
nia. We didn't really know how to
play them the first time around."
The Pitt team of Friday night and
the Pitt team of Saturday night were
two totally different teams. The Lady
Panthers played a much improved
game Saturday; unfortunately, so did
the Lady Gauchos. Pitt was‘-able to

interception on the next offensive
series allowing the Boilermakers to
"score their second touchdown.

"The national anthem was barely
over and we found ourselves down
14-0," said Head Coach Mike
Gottfried.

In the fourth quarter with only 2:14
left in the game, the last of Rasp’s six
punts was blocked and recovered by
strong safety Damon Taylor at the Pitt
1 3.

Purdue scored for the last time.19
seconds later making the final score
41-26. *

”They were jumping around a lot
on defense. I guess they just got

win the first game 15-9. Although
UCSB swept the next three games, it
is significant that Pitt was able to take
the first game. -A lot of teams don't

vwin one against a nationally ranked

California team. Pitt players Denise
Frawley and Lisa Stewart established

through," Rasp said. "I feel like I
should get every kickoff."
The first punt of the game gave

momentum to the Boilermakers im- .

mediately, which is why the con-
sistency Klausing may have found in
the kicking game (still lacking on
punts) concerns him. Neither Klaus-
ing nor Gottfried said anything
specific about what will be done un-
til the game films are reviewed.

Rasp said he wasn't sure what had
to be done to solve the problem. The
most obvious answer is to punt
quicker. Both snaps on the blocked
punts were good enough not to cause

themselves as national calibre players
in this match. Santa Barbara coach
Kathy Gregory regarded Frawley and
Stewart as "two of the finest spikers
we've played against." If Frawley and
Stewart continue to play well and are
consistent, Coach Collier sees no

reason why Pitt won't later prove to

be a force not to be taken too light-
Iy. Pitt has been working hard and
that work is finally paying off.

In the final match of the tourna-
ment, Pitt took on Georgetown.
‘Traditionally a tough team, the Hoyas
lost to Pitt in three quick games 6-15,
7-15 and 2-15. The Lady Panthers
were able to use everyone on the
roster (except Nora MulvihiII) versus
the Hoyas. Sue Hoover had eight kills
and Kelly Matheis chipped in five
more to pace the Lady Panthers.
Michelle Docharty had five kills to

Punting prob/ems continue to plague Panthers,

allow him more time.

"Having two punts blocked wasn't ,1 
a good sign," Gottfried said. "Wei?
had too many breakdowns." . - ff ’

Breakdowns are the kind of thing I
that make life miserable for Klausing. _ »

J Both kicks had plenty of distance I
and neither‘ wavered to the. left or‘ J
right. The 47-yard kick in the second , V-

quarter was the first field goal in’

game was 1984 when they lost to:

Panthers blank Bisons
to remain undefeated

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panthers soccer team im-
proved its record to 4-0 with a 1-0
win over the Bucknell Bisons Satur-
day. ’’I am very pleased,” said Pitt
coach Joe Luxbacher. ”We played
really hard throughout the entire
game.”

Both teams came out fired up.
There was superb defense on both
sides of the field. Each team had ear-
ly scoring opportunities, but every
time they were in close, the ball
would go wide or high. Then with
19:50 left in the first half, Buckn_e||
broke through the Pitt defense. A
couple of pin-point passes faked Pitt
goalie Mark Hendricks out of the
play, but Bucknel|’s shot hit the top
post of the goal and bounced back
on the field. A sigh of relief came
from the crowd, and the score re-
mained deadlocked at 0.

’’It was tough out there today,” said
Hendricks. ”They had the chances
but didn't make the most of them.
We did have a bit of luck when the
ball hit off the post; boy was I happy

when it did.”

The rest of the first half was the
same. The biggest player on the field
at this time had to be Pitt junior
Chukwuma Emejulu. He stopped a
number of Bison drives and was all
over the field. As the exciting first half
came to a close, the scoreboard
showed 0-0.

When the second half started,

‘H Bucknell was even more fired up

than Pitt. The Bisons got through the
Panther defense a couple of times,
but a nice save by Hendricks and a
wide kick ended both drives. Then
Pitt came alive. They drove down the
field, but each time, a bad pass or a
missed kick would give the ball back
to Bucknell. The game was turning
into a real defensive battle, but all of
a sudden Pitt broke through the Bison
wall. Erim Gude received a pass deep
inside the Bucknell defense; his shot
was knocked away by Bison goalie
Dan Norton and rolled out of
bounds, giving Pitt a side kick. Gude
kicked it into play, and it hit off the
top of the Bison goal. As it bounced
off, Pitt senior Mike Grimes headed
the ball into the net to give Pitt a one-

”That first goal totally changed the
mood of the game,” commented Pitt
senior Joe Triglia. ”Our defense was
great. We just shut them down.”

Pitt was flying high. Three minutes
later Emejulu took another shot on
goal. It looked like it was going in,
but Norton made a diving save. The
score remained 1-0. The rest of the
game consisted of the Pitt defense
turning away the Bucknell offense.

ing the end of the game, the Pitt team
came off the field with their winning
streak still alive.

”This game was our first real test,”
said Pitt tri-captain Todd Smith. ’’I’m
glad we won, it was a good all-
around effort.”

”We wanted it more than them,”
added sophomore Jeff Vargas. ”This
is a lot better than last year.”

Pitt's next game is at Edinboro on
Wednesday afternoon. ”They always
play us tough,” said Luxbacher. ’’It

is always a good game, they will be '

ready for us.”

to ”appreciate the moment.” Friday
night, the Lady Panthers volleyball
team ”appreciated the moment.”
Despite a three-match loss to UC
Santa Barbara, Pitt gained the respect
of everyone in,Fitzgerald Fieldhouse.
Pitt played the seventh-ranked Lady
Gauchos with an unrelenting inten-
sity. Coach Shelton Collier ‘was
pleased with his team's performance.
”We played the seventh—ranked
team in the nation, and we played

them well. We looked very good." ’

The fast-paced Santa Barbara team
won the first match 15-9. The second
match was one that many believe Pitt
should have won.The scrappy Lady
Panther offense put some points on
the board before dropping the match
13-15. Coach Collier noted,”We
didn't give Santa Barbara those
points. We really made them work

for it." The Lady Gauchos won the‘

final match 15-7. Coach Collier

taining to watch. I know we had a lot
of fun playing Santa Barbara." '

Pitt's outside hitter Denise Frawley: ’  
led both teams with 16 kills. Frawley ,_  :_j1l
had a very impressive overall game.  9*’

Louise O'Shaughnessey also turned
in an outstanding performance. She
was able to keep her composure
throughout the evening. The Lady
Panthers adjusted well to the quick

‘tempo used by Santa Barbara. Pitt,

equipped with a healthy bench, was

able to freely substitute. The Lady’ ‘
Gauchos were paced by Judy ~

Bellomo and Charlotte Mitchel with
12 kills each. " ‘

A lot of positive feedback came out
of thisloss. Pitt played impressive
volleyball against one of the best
teams in the nation, proving that Pitt
will be a major team to contend with
this season. Coach Collier and his

- Lady Panthers have a tough schedule _

in which they must face several other
nationally ranked teams. ‘

it seems that goals of a Big East Ti-‘l ' I

tie and an NCAA bid are still _in sight.

Against Purdue, Congemi threw for

But the real hero of Saturday's
game had to be Jeff VanHorne, the-
freshman kicker from Cheney, Wash.

PVanHorne was two for two on field
goal attempts and five for five on ex-

Rutgers contest to find the last time
Pitt kicked a field goal, and all the
way back to the 1984 season to find
the last time a Pitt kicker was good
on two field goals in a single game.

’’I’m glad I was able to do it,” said
VanHorne. ”I was just happy to be
able to do my job.”

The game was not all wine and
roses for the Panthers, however. Reg-
gie Williams, who had been Pitt's
best receiver the first two games of
this season, will be out four-six weeks
with a broken fibula. That makes the
continued development of Heard
even more important for the already
thin receiving corps.

George——

Continued from page 9
‘ is 1-1 and right now he is presumably
in a great deal of pain.

George was sacked six times and
lost 67 yards. He was forced into
throwing five interceptions. This was
not Ball State George was playing.

”There are a lot of things I need to
learn,” George said. ”I made some
better reads today, but a lot of our
receivers are out and we've lost some
speed, so it's a lot harder. They did
a lot of blitzing and blew our game
plan. I learned I can take the hits to-
day.”

The Pitt defense had incorporated
confusing the inexperienced George
in its game plan, forcing him to throw
into coverage. That part of Pitt's plan
worked perfectly.

”Any smart team would try to con-
fuse a young player like that,” Pitt
defensive back Gary Richard said
after the game. ”I think he [George]
is going to be a good quarterback. It
reminds me of John Elway's situation.
When he first came up he had the
same types of problems he [George]
is having, and look where he is right
now.

”If I gave him any advice it would
be to just hang in there."

George does have the makings of
a fine quarterback. He was 28-50 on
Saturday for 264 yards and two
beautiful touchdown passes to Lance
Scheib, reuniting a high school
tandem. Scheib preceded George by
one year out of Warren Central.

Purdue head coach Leon Burtnett
refused to blame George for any of
his team's offensive shortcomings.

The Pitt Classic Volleyball Tournament was held this

By Calvin Holmes
Staff Writer

The 1986 Pitt cross country team
will begin its season this Saturday at
the Penn State Invitational.

The team is coming off a tremen-
dous 1985 season and is looking for-
ward to doing evenbetter this season.
Last year the team had a record of 2-1
in dual meets and first-place finishes
at California University and the Fair

_ mont State lnvitationals. '

”We have a good, experienced
group this year,” said coach John
Vasvary. ”I’m looking for them to do
some good things.” Experience and
maturity have always been key fac-
tors for a winning team, and runner
Joel Ninos provides that ingredient
for the Panthers.

Ninos is a junior this season and
has proved himself as a runner to be
reckoned with. Last April he captured
the title of Big East Champion in the
3,000-meter steeplechase. The
Steeplechase is a race of 8.5 laps
around the track with obstacles such
as hurdles and water jumps to clear.
It is a very demanding and endur-
ance-testing event, but Ninos con-
tinues to excel.

He is back intraining for the up-
coming season. ”The intensity of
training this year is much greater,”

For the last two years at Pitt, Nate
Heyward has been making a name
for himself as one of the hardest hit-
ters on the Panther football team.

' Pretty amazing when you consider

that Nate Heyward is only 5-9 and a

. trim 185 pounds.

Heyward is from Passaic, N.J.

' While attending Passaic High School,

‘THE em NEWS, Monday, September 22, 1986

he played on both sides of the line
of scrimmage. In his senior season
Heyward carried the ball 53 times for
609 yards and blocked for his brother
Craig ”lronhead” Heyward. Hey-
ward had a productive, offensive
senior season, but his defensive skills
are what made him a major college
recruit. In his last season at Passaic
H.S., Heyward was an all-state line-
backer with 94 tackles, including 18
solos. His defensive skills turned the

heads of some college football
powerhouses. Heyward was re-
cruited by Nebraska, Alabama, Geor-
gia and, of course, Pitt. Heyward
chose Pitt over the rest because of its
relative closeness to home.

When Heyward arrived on the Pitt

U football scene in 1984, he was made

into a defensive back by Foge Fazio.
Heyward gained fame as a hard hit-
ter early in his college career. As a

Heyward just looking for a few good hits

freshman, he hit Bill Fralic and gave
him a concussion. He has continued
to be a hard hitter on all of Pitt's
special teams over the last two years.

Heyward saw limited action at
defensive back last year. He ap-
peared in three games and recorded
five tackles. This year he's looking
forward to logging more playing time
because of recent injuries to Teryl
Austin and other key performers in
