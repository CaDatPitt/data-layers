Miss America:

And here
she comes

By David,James
The Pitt News

’ To become recognized worldwide as
an international entertainer is the
ultimate goal of Miss America 1984,
Suzette Charles.

Charles spoke Tuesday at Pitt in a
lecture sponsored by the Pitt Program
Council. The lecture was also part of
the month-long agenda honoring black
history.

Charles grew up in Atlantic City.
home of the Miss America Pageant.

She began singing lessons. tap danc- .

ing lessons and baton twirling lessons
at the age of five. After she won the
“Little Miss New Jersey" contest, an
agent suggested she try for commer-
cials. Soon she was a “veteran” after
performing in several commercials,
television shows and the movie
“Hair. " .

Charles won the title of “Miss New
Jersey” in 1983 and finished as the first
runner-up in the Miss America
pageant. Unrestricted by the obliga-
tions which accompany the title,
Charles was able to take full advantage
of the offers which came her way.

After Vanessa Williams resigned her
crown, Charles reigned as Miss
America for two months. This meant
delaying her performing career. Win-
ning the title was a mixed bag of emo-
tions for Charles.

“There were, of course, mixed emo-
tions. Something happened to our Miss
America. But it was a dream that I
reached for and had wanted as a
child,” said Charles.‘ “In the history
of the pageant there has never been a
black Miss America, but the fact that
there are two black Miss Americas in
one year is quite outstanding.”

While her speech carried a conven-
tional message, Charles came alive in

wards. She bantered back and forth
with the audience, displaying a sense
of humor and pride in her ac-
complishments. Frank Barbalace, lec-
ture committee chairman for the
PPC was elated with the results.

- “The Miss America lecture was one
of the most successful  in terms of
audience participation. There seemed
to be a strong rapport between her and
the audience,’ ’ -said Barbalace.

According to Charles, her best quali-
ty is her-singing. She wants to be
known not as a Miss America who
sings, but rather as a singer who

Center aids mentally

By Joe Krzywiecki
Staff Writer

A public forum was sponsored by the
Western Psychiatric Institute and the
Citizens Advisory Board, to discuss
how mental health/mental retardation
care can be maintained in the 9C-1
catchmet area.

There are ten catchmet districts in the

Pittsburgh area. They were created in
1966 to help the mentally disadvan-
taged to adjust from an institutionalized
existence to a more mainstream life-
style. The 9C-1 catchmet consists of
the Hill District, Oakland, Squirrel Hill
and Greenﬁeld sections of Pittsburgh.

Three members of the Allegheny
County Mental Health/Retardation
Board were on hand to answer ques-
tions about the quality of care in the
9C-l catchmet area. The audience tum-
out was extremely small. Nevertheless,
questions were raised about homeless
in the area and personal home care in
regards to ‘boarding houses for the men-
tally retarded.

., Dr. Nomian Mulgrave, a member of

the county board, said that the county

“Some boarding homes are

some are bad. The problem is

— Dr. Norman Mulgrave

does work with the homeless, by send-
ing outreach teams to shelters, if they
need mental health care.

Mulgrave went on to say that the
quality of personal boarding home care
is hard to judge. “Some boarding
homes are good, some are mediocre

and some are bad. The problem is with.

regulations,” he said.

Mulgrave said that although some
boarding homes provide excellent
health and mental care, there are others
that provide only" enough basic health
care and facilities to meet state
guidelines.

The board also discussed the impor-
tance of continued funding for pro-

grams for-the mentally retarded..One ,

became Miss America. Although not
scheduled to perform, Charles was
coerced by the crowd into an exciting
a cappella rendition of “New At-
titude.”

Charles has a busy future ahead of
her. She hopes to be the host of a televi-
sion show soon and also has plans for
an album. .

For Barbalace, his last production
was a special success.“Miss
America,” he asserted, “was one of
the finest speakers available who
reﬂected a positive, motivating and
driving message to the students, both
black and white.” '

retarded

such program, called Title 19, enables
some M/R patients to leave institutions
and live in small group homes without

losing financial support from the-

government.

Dr. Marty Ayers said that even
though the program is a success by
enabling someindividuals to live in a
mainstream lifestyle, dealing with
federal red tape is a different story.

“One of the guidelines for the pro-
gram is that it would not be more ex-
pensive to have the individual involved
in a community center than living in an
institution,” said Ayers.

He also said that the waiting period
between the application and approval
or refusal can be two to three months.
And the red tape may not end there,
said Ayers. “We must have communi-
ty approval of the center. Then we must
have labor and industry approval.
There is always another hurdle,” said
Ayers.

Ray Firth, the third member of the
panel, said the main purpose of the
board is to meet the needs of the peo-

ple of the county. “We must provide .

consistency with mental health care, if
it is to be effective,’’’ said Firth. _

Race issues hit Philly

By Kathy Stahl
Staff Writer

A recent surge of race-related in-
cidents in Philadelphia will culminate
tomorrow in a march sponsored by the
National Mobilization for-Equality and
Justice. The march will begin with a
rally by the JFK Plaza, will proceed
downtown and, returning, will end
with another rally at the plaza. _

“We need to make a strong, national
statement against racism," said Phebe
Eckfeldt, the media spokeswoman for
the NMEJ. “There has been a danger-
ous cycle of racist acts in southwest
Philadelphia and the climate of fear is

increasing.”

But it is not only in Philadelphia that
the undercurrent of fear has been felt.
Eckfeldt believes that all over the coun-
try an escalation of rioting and discon-
tent has settled in.

“We hope that the march will serve

to bring together justice-loving peo- ,

ple,” said Eckfeldt, “those who are
opposed to police brutality as well as
racism, sexism and bigotry.”

It appears that Philadelphia has

. become the ﬂashpoint in the struggle

against racism. This is mainly due to
all the national attention they have
received in the past year and a half.

On Nov. 17, 1985, Philadelphia
Police Commissioner George Sambor

. resigned. This wassix months after the

confrontations between the local police
and MOVE, a militant black organiza-
tion. The deaths occurring from the
confrontation are believed by many to
have helped spark one of the biggest
police cormption scandals ever.

Whether this was actually instrumen-
tal to what followed in Philadelphia’s
southwest area is debatable. Since then,
there have been numerous racial in-
cidents. This can be verified by many
articles appearing in the Philadelphia
Inquirer as well as other newspaper
sources.

For example, the Inquirer reported
that on Nov. 20, 1985, over 400 whites
demonstrated outside the home of a

. black family that had moved into a

predominantly white area. Also, the
previous week there had been a report
about a black African living in Olney
who was harassed by a band of white
youths. Then, there was the incident of
a pipe bomb which damaged the home
of a black woman. And in December,
a Jewish cultural center was destroyed
by arson. It had just opened a program
for Asian immigrants.

“The police have seen what is hap-
pening and they are ignoring it, thus

promoting the racist acts," said.

Eckfeldt.
On May 28, there was the shooting

of a 41-year-old veteran police officer '

which occurred in a largely Hispanic
neighborhood. The officer was found

slumped behind the wheel of his squad

car.

Eckfeldt said that the police did a
roundup of hundreds of Puerto Ricans
and threw them in jail with no access
to lawyers. The Puerto Ricans were
released after Wilfredo Santiago was
held for the murder.

“It was a frame-up," said Eckfeldt.

“We truly believe that the police‘.

pinned the murder of Santiago.” One
of the NMEJ’s requests at the march
on Saturday will be that he be released.
The Inquirer reports that about 125
people were questioned by—the police’

“The police have seen
what is happening, anal‘
they are choosing to ig-
nore it, thus promoting the
racist actions. ”

— Phebe Eckfeldt

and that the city of Philadelphia agreed
to pay $45,000 to the Hispanic
residents who were unlawfully ha-
rassed by the police.

“The police are not doing much to
stop the hatred being spread by the Ku
Klux Klan, racist mobs ‘or the
supremacist white groups,” said
Eckfeldt.

Members of the NMEJ feel that this i .

is a major contributing factor in the
racial tensions. They‘ also feel that what

is happening in Philadelphia is part of ’

the national climate promoted by the
Reagan administration and his right-
wing policies. His desire to eliminate

affirmative action and to cut programs ,
that help Third World and poor peo- S‘

ple is being met with an undesirable

response shown through all the recent '

racial tensions.

The NMEJ organization has over
400 endorsers nationally and over 100
locally. Eckfeldt said that they are con-
tinually gaining momentum and she ex-

pects over 6,000 people to be present '

at the march.

“We are all uniting,” said Eckfeldt,
“with the common hope that we can
do something to make a difference.
Something has to be done.”

Researcher wins award

Thomas P. Beebe Jr. has’ won the Leybold-Heraeus Award for outstand-
ing research at the University of Pittsburgh’s department of chemistry.
Beebe received $500 and a plaque from the Leybold-Haraeus Corpora- 1
tion for his contributions to a paper entitled “Infrared Spectroscopic Obser-
vations of Surface Bonding in Physical Adsorption: The Physical Adsorp-
tion of CO and SiO2 Surfaces.” The paper deals with the interaction be-
tween carbon monoxide and a silica surface. '

Beebe is currently in his fourth year of graduate work at the Surface
Center under the direction of Dr. John T. Yates Jr. He came to the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh after graduating from Franklin and Marshall College
of Lancaster, Pa., with a bachelor’s in chemistry. During the summers
of ’81 and ’82, Beebe was a student researcher in a joint Franklin and
Marshall/DuPont‘Experimental Station in Wilmington, Del.

The Leybold-Haraeus presentation is an annual award given to an
outstandingqgraduate researcher in the field of surface chemistry.

CAPE CANAVERAL —— The
presidential panel investigating the
Challenger explosion visited the Ken-
nedy Space Center yesterday to study
documents which show problems with
the shuttle booster rockets. The space
agency documents were revealed
Wednesday. One of the papers shows
that the company which built
Challenger’s solid-fuel rocket was con-
cerned about problems with the booster
rocket seals — so concerned that its
engineers presented 43 possible
modiﬁcations to NASA last year.
Other documents show that in March
1983 NASA formally waived its re-
quirements for fail—safe operation and
pressed on with shuttle launches,
knowing a single seal failure could be
catastrophic under certain conditions.
Film of Challenger’s fatal launch on
Jan. 28 shows a jet of ﬂame spewing
from the lower side of the shut_tle’s
right-side booster rocket. The ﬂame ap-
parently sparked the explosion of the
ship’s external fuel tank, blowing
Challenger to bits and killing its seven
crew members.
The “abnormal plume” appears to

have spurted from the booster at or -

near a joining between two of four fuel
segments that are bolted’ together to
form the rocket. Neither booster has
been recovered, but the right-hand
rocket or at least major parts of it may
be in water 1,100 feet deep about 40

miles off shore.

A special NASA safety panel said
more tests are needed on a new
lightweight solid-fuel rocket booster the
Air Force wants for its military shut-
tle ﬂights. The panel also said it has
some concerns about the Vandenburg
Air Force Base launch pad the military
wants to use. The Vandenburg pad
does not ﬂex under launch loads the
way the mobile platform at the Ken-
nedy Space Center does.

Sixth ﬂeet
resumes exercises .

WASHING.TON - The United
States Sixth Fleet resumed aircraft
ﬂight operations on Wednesday and
saw Navy ﬁghters encountering more
than 18 Soviet-built Libyan jets. There
were no altercations. American of-
ficials are now saying that the United
States will keep pressure on Moammar
Khadafy’s country instead of halting
operations tonight as planned. The
Navy will conduct its ﬂight maneuvers
in the Mediterranean on and off
through the end of March.

The aircraft carriers Saratoga and
Coral Sea are among 20 U.S. ships
patrolling the waters off Libya.
According to American officials, a
third carrier — the America — may

NASA papers reveal problems

leave Norfolk, Va., to join the ﬂeet by
mid-March. Four Soviet warships were
cruising near the Gulf of Sidra Sunday
and were suspected of keeping Libya
informed about the U.S. operations.

Japan extends
curb on exports

WASHINGTON — American auto
industry officials are praisingVJapan’s
announcement to extend voluntary
curbs on auto exports to the United
States for a sixth straight year. Japanese
ofﬁcials acknowledged that the decision
is a bid to avert trade retaliation from
Washington. One ofﬁcial said the deci-
sion was based on a political and
economic judgment in giving priority
to Japan’s national interests.

J apan’s seven automakers will limit
their car exports to 2.3 million units in
the fiscal year beginning April 1, the

same restraint as this year. UAW Presi— '

dent Owen Bieber said he’s relieved
that Japan “has decided not to further
erode America’s industrial base.”
Bieber said that thousands of additional
auto and auto—related jobs in the United
States might have been lost if the
Japanese automakers had been allowed
to further ﬂood the U.S. market.

Ford said Japan’s move is “a con-
structive decision.”

The Pitt News, February 14, l986

Chrysler called the decision “ap-
propriate,” saying, “this could be a
step toward resolving the trade im-
balance.”

Senator John Glenn, D-Ohio, called
it “tremendous news for the U.S.
economy and J apanese-American trade
relations." '

British train
Botswanan soldiers

LONDON — Government sources in
London said British troops will train
Botswana’s army to deal with cross-
border raids by South Africa. The
sources said about 90 members of a
special forces unit of Britain’s Strategic
Air Services will train the Botswanan
soldiers on ways to neutralize a raiding
team. They said Botswana asked for
help after South Africa raided the
former British colony in search of
African National Congress guerrillas.

Walk throughhistory: The Alma Mater  

By. Deneen Denoneour
For The Pitt News

As the 1986-87 school year ap-
proaches, the university prepares to
celebrate its 200th anniversary. In com-
memoration of the bicentennial,
Omicron Delta Kappa will take a walk
through Pitt history:

There was a time when every
freshman woman had to recite the
Alma Mater to the dean of women (a
position that no longer exists). The
“newlies" wore green armbands until
the Alma Mater had been correctly
recited, at which time they exchanged

first college west o_f the Allegheny
Mountains. It was decided that Pitts-
burgh had a character distinct from
Philadelphia, Boston and New York
and therefore needed a “European-
like” university of its own.

Although many school songs seem
quite generic, our Alma Mater is
specifically tailored to a Pittsburgh
university. What other university could
the following verses be describing?

vides some insight into Pitt history. ' _

Historically, our university preceded
the nation as a whole in proclaiming
equality to all. Pitt displayed an early
commitment to cultural diversity (later
reappearing in the construction of the
nationality rooms). Thus, Pitt’s Alma
Mater reaffirmed ,the notion that
segregation has no place in education.

Infectious Mayhem

It’s no wonder that college students are rarely
afforded the respect and courtesy due responsi-
ble adults. Brawling and jeering obscenities and
infantile prattle seem ever a part of a large
assemblage of college-age individuals. Take for
instance the free preview of “Wildcats” at the
David Lawrence auditorium this past Tuesday.
That the . movie itself was a showcase of
mindlessness and tedium is irrelevant. The point
is that the students gathered there displayed the
type of base behavior normally witnessed at a
studio wrestling match. While one expects a cer-
tain meanness among the common hordes that
attend those grandiose farces, it is presumed,
perhaps naively, that college students will carry
themselves with somewhat more decorum. The
movie “Wildcats” was twice interrupted by
fighting students; and throughout, sheepish
students boldly hurled random, pointless, profane
execrations at one another, at themselves and at
no one in particular, from the safety of their
darkened corners.

Sadly, this is not an isolated incident. One need
only recall the annual Pitt-Penn State bloodfest
to be reminded of this. And the streets of Oakland
at night bring to mind images of a carnival gone
mad. There is little evidence here that students
in general have been in any way elevated by their
studies.

Of course this is not an indictment against all
college-age students. Indeed, there are a large
number that manage to entertain and amuse
themselves without resorting to drunkenness,
mayhem and destruction. But there are just enough
of the boorish sort to sully the reputation of all.
Their actions earn us all skeptical regard and the
watchful eye of burly policemen and their shaggy
canine friends.

Sim_ply Speaking/Tim van Gelder

Buckle Up  It’s Captain Kirk

Every now and again the question of
compulsory seat belt laws comes up,
and we all ponder the fundamental con-
flict between individual freedom and
the paternalistic concerns of the state.
Some of us side with the individual and
some of us side with the state, but the
main point is that we all take this dilem-

ma — this fundamental moral dilem-

ma, a moral tragedy really, because
whatever we do we’re going to end up
half wrong —— very seriously. Either we
further impose the rules and regulations
of the state on the lives of everyday
people — people who know best for
themselves —— or we knowingly allow
hundreds more to die every year.
Well, that’s all fine, but you start to
feel pretty silly when you realize that
the only reason these laws are being
pushed through at all is because the in-
surance companies are tired of paying
huge sums for car fatalities — huee
sums they‘ could have stashed in their
coffers if only those people had been
made to wear their seat belts. Or at
least I feel pretty silly — arguing about
high—ﬂying philosophical concerns like

liberty and the state when the prime '

movers in the seat belt area are just the
big insurance companies. Did any in-
surance company rates ever go down
when seat belt laws were introduced?
No way. It’s just profits to them,
money they were paying out last year
but which this year they can put away
to fatten their accounts, building in-
surance empires larger than oil com-
panies, larger than the GNP of half the
countries in the Third World, larger
than the federal deficit even.

Mind you, I’m not arguing in favor
of libertarians on this issue — maybe
we should have compulsory seat belt

. laws; maybe the big companies just

happen to be on the right side for once.

I’m not really sure, and, right at the
moment, it’s not all that important
anyway. The point is it suits the in-
surance companies just fine, really, if
we agonize about all these side issues
because it takes our minds off the real
reason for these laws — if we knew the
real reason, then we’d be a lot less like-
ly to allow Congress to pass the laws.

The issue of course is Star Wars,
which appears to be more complex and
difficult than any issue we’ve ever
faced before. And so we go on argu-
ing about whether it could ever work;
whether the computer programs could
ever be written; whether it would really
contribute to strategic stability; whether
the Soviets have a similar program;
whether it would cost too much;
whether this and whether that, when,
of course, the whole point is that Star
Wars just means big bucks for defense
contractors -- very big bucks. We
argue and think and argue some more
until we just get so confused we give
up caring. Meanwhile, the whole pro-
gram has got off the ground and is run-
ning right under our noses!

The big arms contractors, like
General Dynamics, Boeing and
Rockwell, are falling over backward
trying to grab their share of the money
that the Pentagon is lavishly doling out,
and they know that as spending in-
creases, the harder it will be to stop the
program. As it is, the program is get-
ting so big that not just corporations but
whole communities and research in-
stitutes and university departments are
all going tobe hooked on Star Wars
money — so their voices are being add-
ed to those pressing for more space
weaponry. Their logic and thought are
becoming irreparably twisted through
the sheer ﬁnancial dynamics of it all.

Star Wars, of course, is even worse

than the seat belt ripoff,_because if you
just reﬂect for half a minute it’s patent-
ly obvious that the thing couldn’t work
and is just a massive pork barrel. The
only reason we keep wondering about
it is because everyone else is, and we
naively suppose that if we are going
ahead with such a massive program
there must be some sense or logic
behind it somewhere. There isn’t, of
course, but it’s all very convenient for
mega-corporations, like Martin Mariet-
ta and General Electric, if the endless
argument goes on - while people are
arguing about it, they're not doing
anything to halt this monstrous abuse
of public money.

It’s even more convenient if certain
naive elements of the public actually
argue in favor of building a Star Wars
space defense — in effect they will do
the dirty work of spreading all the lies
and illusions so necessary for the pro-
gram’s. continuation. Meanwhile, the
defense contractors are laughing all the
way to the bank, where they stash away
those dollars that might have been spent
on helping our farmers or preserving
the environment or keeping some poor
people warm in winter.

It’s not that I think Star Wars
shouldn’t be considered very careful-
ly. It should. The point: We’ve con-
sidered it carefully already, and anyone
in his right mind can see how hopeless
it is. The more we argue now, the more
we delay putting_ a halt to this massive
fraud. It’s just like the case of com-
pulsory seat belt laws. The public
debate is a smokescreen, behind which
the companies — in league with various
other slimy creatures, like weapons
scientists and cold war idealogues ~
go about rearranging the world to suit
the desired size of their bank accounts.

There's a, logical fallacy (or

I-low then, to celebrate Love?
How to celebrate Valentine’s Day?
First, go ask out your best friend’s
girlfriend. take her to a movie, then
to your apartment. dim the lights
(you can guess the rest).

Or maybe you could ask out your
second best friend's girlfriend and
arrange a blind date with your best
friend, take pictures of them and
mail them to your b.f.’s g.f..And
so on. Happens every day. So
maybe a better idea would be ,

Love is primarily about being sen-

One thing is for sure: It sure ain‘t

So do we declare death to Love?
Is love simply an emotional weapon

Thinking Out Loud/David Ja

mes I .

Holidfys And How To Celebrate ’Em

Happy Valentine’s Day! Those of
you who were unaware that today was
Valentine’s Day shouldn’t sweat it.
There probably isn’t anyone you felt
like giving a card to this year anyway.

When I was in elementary school, we
always had a big Valentine’s Day par-
ty. All the kids would go out and buy
those big boxes of Valentine’s Day
cards you get at the drugstore. It would
take me hours to decide what little girl
got what valentine. Even at that tender
age, I knew I didn’t want to give the
card with two teddy bears locked in a
passionate smooch to Agnes. Truthful-
ly — I didn’t want to give any card to
Agnes. I’m conﬁdent I’ll grow-out of
this eventually. ’

The subject of one holiday brings the
others to mind. Holidays are sort of a

mixed blessing; you have to take the
good with the bad.

Halloween used to be my favorite
holiday. That was back in the days
when all anybody had to do was trick
or treat in a costume he made at home.
One Halloween, my Dad helped me
make a robot’ costume out of an old
refrigerator box. It was easily the best
costume I ever had. Problem was —- I
couldn’t walk the stairs in that box. I
lost out on a lot of candy that year.

I really like Thanksgiving. Every
Thanksgiving I follow the _same
routine. I get up late and rush outto
play in a Turkey Bowl football game.
This is actually a planned ploy so that
I won’t have to help out with dinner.
I spend the whole day knocking around
in the cold and wet, arriving home just

in time for dinner. Dinner is the best
part of Thanksgiving. After dinner, I’m
much too sore to help clean up. What
a great holiday.

Christmas is a tough holiday. I’m in-
secure enough that I worry about what
I’m getting for whom. I’d much rather
buy an extravagant gift for someone
who gives me a pencil box, than
receive an expensive coat from some-
one I sent a box of candy to  Speak-
ing of gifts, how come nobody ever
buys anybody shoes?

I love New Year’s Eve. Seems like
no sooner are the Christmas parties
over than it’s time for a New _Year’s
bash. There’s lots to like about New
Year’s. You get to kiss every girl at the
party. Usually a few are tipsy, and, in
all the confusion, you can kiss them

twice. Besides that, New Year’s is a
great excuse for an all-night party. I
like to think of all the carousing I do
during the year as practice for New
Year’s.

Many holidays are mistreated. For
instance, Memorial Day should be a
day to pay homage to soldiers who died
fighting for our country. Instead, many
of us think of it only as a signal that
summer is over. Or is it the beginning‘?
I won’t even go into Labor Day. Just
see the above problem. «

I have a few questions about Ground-
hog Day. How do they get that ground-
hog to come on up out of his hole? If
I were a groundhog I wouldn’t come
out with all those people around.

Grandparents are wonderful people.
Some of my best times and memories

are days I spent with Grandma. Grand-
parent’s Day, however, just doesn’t stir
me. I don’t like holidays which “feel”
like they were invented by F.T.D. and
Hallmark.

If you are one of those people Valen-
tine’s Day caught by surprise, you
should realize that it’s still salvageable.
Go get yourself some cards and take -
a walk around the student union, or
even the library. If you see someone
you like, or someone who looks lone-
ly, stop over and give them a card.
Holidays are times to be with other
people, so don’t be shy. If you happen
to see someone you really like, don’t
hesitate — give them the two teddy
bears in the passionate embrace. Hap-
py Valentine’s Day, everybody!

Muddling Through/John Zaphyrf

Lamentations From The Lovelorn

' Valentine’s Day is upon us. A time
of love and sentiment. A time for can-
dy and roses and swollen hearts. In
fact, in the lines to follow, there will
be an assortment of messages of love
and affection.

You know, I hate Valentine’s Day.
I hate everything about it. I hate the
flowers and those silly cards and, yes,
even the candy. Feb.‘ 14 is the worst
day of the year for me. I really hate it.

It wasn’t always that way, though.
I used to think the holiday was great.
My mother would buy me candy, and
I would get money from my relatives,
even my rotten, big sister would buy
me a card. It was really great. Then —
I had to start school. I was one of those
kids who never got a Valentine’s card.
Everybody else would exchange those
little, heart—shaped greetings and laugh
and giggle and have a great time. Not
me. I would be the only one without
a card. The teacher would finally come
over to me and say that mine was lost.

681-2202
681-2203

As I grew older, I became more
philosophical toward the holiday. I
would say the day was stupid, childish,
only for little, wide—eyed sissies. A real
man ignores Valentine’s Day. You
wouldn’t catch Clint Eastwood giving
a card with a little heart on it to some-
one. I never gave any cards to any
girls, never had any sweethearts,'and

~ I berated those who did.

“-It’s a waste of money," I would say
in my angry tone, “and, gosh darn it,
if I’m going to spend my money on a
darn, wimpy card just to get a peck on
the cheek from some girl that’s gonna
forget about me the next day anyway!”

In fact, just last week I was prepared
to protest the day. I was going to start
an anti—Valentine’s Day movement. I
was going to call it “Students Against
Valentine’s Day.” My group would
call for the abolishment of Valentine’s
Day, forever. We would ask the
university to divest in all cardshops,
candy stores, florists and department

stores that actively promote such a
heinous holiday.

But, I‘ve begun to question -my
motives since I started this column. Did
I really hate Valentine’s Day (after all,
it’s named after a saint and you really
shouldn’t hate a patron saint)>Aor was
there something else? Was it the day
that angered me? Did the sight of all’
those hearts and flowers and happy.
lovestruck faces cause my blood
pressure to rise? Or was it the feelings
that the holiday evoked in me that
caused me to feel such resentment on
that day? A '

Actually, Valentine’s Day is a nice
holiday. It’s a celebration of love, and
who am I to knock love? It’s really a
day when you can let people that you
care about know your true feelings —
even though it’s through those mushy
cards. Maybe Cupid isn’t such a bad
guy, after all, and red is a pretty color.

But Christmas is a nice holiday, too.
For most people it is the most joyous

time of the year —— yet there are more
suicides at this time than during any
other time of year. Sometimes a
celebration, such as Christmas, can
cause a terrible amount of pain. For
those people who have no families, no
friends, no money, Christmas is the
worst day of the year.

For me, the same holds true for
Valentine’s Day. Just imagine yourself
walking down Forbes Avenue and
looking at the different Valentine's
specials on cards and such, knowing
that there would be no one for you to
give them to. Just imagine looking in
your mailbox on Valentine’s morning
and realizing that it would be empty.
Just imagine discovering that there
really was nobody you could say “I
love you” to on this holiday. Doesn’t
make for a fun day.

Oh, I’m sure there are those of you
reading this column who are going to
say I’m over-reacting. C’mon, John!

It isn’t that bad. Some of you will prob-
ably think I'm just whining and that I
just want some pity from the public.
Well, maybe I do! I think it would be
just great if I came up to The Pitt News
and my mailboxwas full of Valentine’s
cards. It would be wonderful if our
phone lines were jammed with women

"wanting to be my Valentine.

Of course, that‘s not going to hap-
pen. I’ve grown to accept my life. I’ve
grown to accept that on Valentine’s
Day I’m going to be depressed. I don’t
hate the day anymore. I don’t like it,
but Idon’t hate it. And, before you
write this column off as being so much
self-pitying, woe-is-me babble, re-’
member how some people might feel
on Valentine’s'Day. Remember those
people who have no one in particular
to give a Valentine’s card to on this _
ultimate day of love. Remember them
and hug your girlfriend or kiss your
boyfriend. Happy Valentine’s Day!

Magee enjoys 75th  

By Michelle Z_ollner
Staff Writer

Didn’t your mother ever tell you that
the stork was the one who delivered
babies? At Magee—Womens Hospital
the tale becomes a reality.

Mr. Stork, the mascot of Magee—_
Womens Hospital, will help celebrate
the hospital’s 75th anniversary. “Over
the years I’ve helped deliver thousands
of babies,” said the stork. “In 1984
and 1985 alone over 10,000 babies
'were born.

“My job has always been demanding
— I work 365 days a year; I’m on call
24 hours a day; and I’m usually found
at several places at one time."

The stork made arrangements with
Christopher Lyman Magee, the
founder of the hospital, to be available
at all times for deliveries. “I’ve not
missed one,” said the stork, “but I’ve
seen a lot of changes over the years.“

Elizabeth Steel Magee Hospital, as
it wasoriginally named, opened 75
years ago as a haven for unwed
mothers. Christopher Magee stipulated

then that women be admitted "without
any questions asked as to their lives or
names.” What is known as Magee—
Womens Hospital has evolved into the
largest private obstetrical hospital in the
United States, treating women with
high-risk pregnancies, severely ill in-
fants and conducting extensive research
to discover new treatments for such
conditions as premature labor, sexual-
ly transmitted diseases and pregnancies
complicated by diabetes and other
medical disorders. Through the years,
however, Christopher Magee’s dream,
hope and goal of a women’s hospital
which respects the privacy of its pa-
tients has been upheld.

Along with Mr. Stork’s continued
participation, throughout the year dif-
ferent activities are planned to com-
memorate the founding.

Magee has already launched a baby
find to locate the oldest baby born at
the hospital. A 26-foot banner is hung
at Magee that depicts the anniversary
logo signifying the diamond anniver-
sary. lt will remain up through this year
of celebration.

Chemistry club road trip  
ends in disappointment

By Michele Kiraly
Staff Writer

“Mixed feelings” was one reaction
from Pitt student affiliates of the
American Chemical Society on the
crash of the space shuttle Challenger.

The students traveled to Cape

Canaveral, Fla. to witness a space shut— «

tle launch in January. However, the
launch was postponed several times
during their stay. They returned to
Pittsburgh on Sunday, Jan. 26 without
viewing the launch.

A launch planned for early that
morning was moved again to Tuesday
morning. It was during Tuesday’s shut—
tle flight that the craft caught fire and
exploded minutes after liftoff.

"I think it [the crash] made a larger
impact on us because we could have
been there to see it,” said John
Swestock, ACS member.

“I was very upset about the crash.
I really wanted to see a shuttle launch
and we were supposed to see one.”
said Kelly Brownlee, ACS member.

She added that the students were go-
ing to sit in the grandstands with the
media and family and friends of the
shuttle crew. “I probably would have
been in a great deal of shock if we had

been there,” said Brownlee.

Regarding the trip to Florida,
MaryAnn Fundy, president of ACS at
Pitt, explained that there is very little
involvement with the space program in

chemists

Pittsburgh. “We wanted to be exposed
to it, so we decided to visit NASA.

“Also, we wanted to see an actual
shuttle launch and we wanted to learn
about careers within the field," said
Fundy.

Eighteen Pitt students, majoring in
chemistry or chemical engineering,
made the trip to Florida on Jan. 21-26.
It was funded through student govern-
ment fund—raisers (such as a hoagie
sale) and the students’ own money.

The group also planned to tour the
NASA space center labs. However, the
labs were closed to the public to per-
mit preparation for the launch. Fundy
said.

The trip wasn’t a complete disap-
pointment. The students were able to
see the space shuttle launch pad. They
also saw the Vehicle Assembly
building, a 52—story building in which
the shuttle is assembled.

The group also toured the Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance Center in Orlan-
do. Fundy said they hadn’t planned to
visit it but did so as an alternative when
the NASA labs were closed.

At the NMR center, the group
viewed magnetic resonance equipment
used by scientists and analytical
to determine chemical
compounds.

“The equipment is used for
diagnostic purposes, too. Readings of
certain chemicals in the body can be
taken using certain machines,” said
Brownlee.

the resulting corporations —— power —
have completely redefined what it real-

turned this formula into an ironic joke.

Nowhere is this more clear or more ‘

A . emerged. In order to emerge, these

people have put up their own. money,
manufactured and distributed their
own records and toured for weeks and
months on end, in cars or vans, per-
forming anywhere they and their music
can interact directly with the public.
The most noteworthy of the under-
ground are rock’s lowest common
denominator: the hardcore punks. This
genre is so limiting and so inaccessi-
ble to most, that it often seems that
they continue to struggle for commer-
cial survival only to spite those who
fear and scorn them. But as you listen
to their thrashing guitars and snotty,
rebellious tone you realize that their
existence is necessary and even

~ essential, if rock music is to survive in

a meaningful way.

When Jello Biafra of the Dead Ken-
nedys shouts out their latest single,
“MTV Get Off the Air!” he may not be
speaking for everyone but he is speak-
ing for some. No, they —— this special
audience — aren’t all that important
and they don’t have a lot of money to

i spend on records, but they do believe

that rock should be wild, rebellious, 
honest and extremely imrnature.. 
These kids like their brand of music 1.

and support it. Because they support '

it there are bands like the Kennedys,

D.O.A. and the Circle Jerks, who have '

pressed records and toured America
and Europe for the past five or so

years. This is one of the most unsung T i
success stories in rock history. With 

absolutely no real media or financial
support, they have carvedout their

own solid, if obscure niche in the rock 

industry.

I chose these three records to review 1

because they are all by bands who

have succeeded on exactly these
terms.

Frankenchrist is The Dead Ken-V. ’:

nedys’ third full-length LP and by far

the best of the three. It is very much ~A

like their past efforts in that it is socially
and politically motivated, highlighting

A Panache for Sleaze — the Waters Aestheti

By Adam Eisenstat

In the church of sleaze, John Waters
is a high priest, if not a bishop. Best
known as the auteur of such “ce||uloid
atrocities” as Pink Flamingos and
Polyester, he is also a regular con-
tributor to Rolling Stone, American Film
and other publication receptive to his
unique brand of domestic decadence.

Waters, a Baltimore native, is ob-
sessed by the grotesque, gruesome,
artificial and incredibly cheap. He is an
avid reader of The National Enquirer
(“Bad taste has never been so naked
and cheap.”) and he regularly attends
murder trials around the country, favor-
ing the most extreme and sensational.
These obsessions are filtered through
his distinctly American brand of ab-
surdism, rendering the vast mosaic of
indigenous human and cultural waste
very laughable, if not tinged with a
trace of horror. A

Among Waters’ main film influences
are those enshrined in the pantheon of
sleaze/camp/pop cinema like New
Yorkers Jack Smith, the Kuchar
brothers and doyen of grotesque
voyeurism Andy Warhol. Waters’
favorite filmmaker of all time is Russ
Meyer, the creator of such massive
mammary-laden pre-porn classics as
Vixens, Beyond the Valley of Ultra-
vixens and Faster Pussycat, Kill Kill
(“My Citizen Kane,” says Waters).
Other influences Waters cites are gore
king Hershell Gorden, Lewis
(Bloodfeast, Gore Gore Girls,) and gim-
mick master William Castle (The
Ting/er). '

ln Waters’ films’ a panoply of out- «

casts, sexual mutants and cartoonishly

 

despicable people hurt and kill one
another, engage in deviant sex and eat
dog shit. Great fun in other words. Part
of the reason Waters’ treatment of
such lowly and seemingly grim sub-
jects is so light and funny is because
of his childishly scatological sense of
humor. Vomit, feces and other bodily
functions play a major role in his film
aesthetic. Also, the repertory cast he
uses in his films, which includes
300-lb. transvestite Divine and the late
Edith Massey (the- egg lady in Pink
Flamingos), are like one big happy
family and have shared many wild

good times together, as documented in
Waters’ funny and intelligent biog-
raphy Shock Value. He exploits their
deformities and unusual talents in a
way that seems mutually beneficial to
both this connoisseur of the outre and
these outrageous exhibitionists.
Waters’ films are huge cult classics,
which is understandable considering
how hilarious and shocking they can
be. His most popular film, Pink Flam-
ingos, depicts things on screen that
most people could never even imag-
ine, that is until after seeing this super
low budget ($12,000) tale of “the
filthiest people alive.’,’ Although Waters
is a very good screenwriter with a flair
for the extravagant plot twist and
brilliant dialogue, it’s his sense of
pyrotechnic freakishness that makes a
film like Pink Flamingos stand out.
Such intriguing and/or revolting oc-
currences in the film include beastiali-'
ty (with a chicken and a couple), an
egg fetishist, a malformed transsexual,
cannibalism, mass murder and the
coprophilic finale in which‘ Divine eats
a newly laid dog turd. No mirrors here.
This scene gives new meaning tothe
phrase “eat shit.” .
There’s a decidedly anti-Hollywood
ambience to Waters’ films, which are
often shot badly, wretchedly acted and
generally pervaded by the crude and
cheap. But like all original celluloid
subversives, his films engage in an
ongoing dialogue with _Hollywood
forms and archetypes. Divine’s simply
outrageous parodies of 1940s starlet
digs and her/his hyper-camp inter-_
pretation of screen babe glamour and
melodrama illustrate the homage
to/parody of Hollywood that goes on in

all of Waters’ films.

For all of his appreciation of
Hollywood tackiness and artificiality,
Waters is certainly not Hollywood. He
completelysidesteps this Babylon and
creates his own in mise en scene jux-
tapositions like the one in Pink Flam-

‘ ingos where Divine struts provocatively

down the street with a just-shoplifted
steak between her legs, past a wall
which has spraypainted on it in huge

letters “Free Tex Watson,” (there’s a
Manson Family reference in all of

Waters" films) while thesoundtrack

blares Little Richard’s ‘‘The Girl Can’t

Help It.’’» This nifty little collage attests

to Waters’ deep understanding of the
sleazy sexual essence of proto-rock ‘n’
roll. It alsopresents aparallel between
Divine’s beef deviance and the Man-
son Family's deviance. This scene
shows the influence of Jack Smith,
whose 1963 seminal classic Flamingo
Creatures features frenzied shots of
transvestites in postwar -Hollywood
costumes ‘having orgies and mastur-
bating while pop songs, fragments
from phony commercials and tango
music buzz away on the soundtrack.
In his articles and book, Waters
emerges as a master theoretician of
underground/B movies and bad taste
in general. He makes a distinction be-
tween good bad taste and plain bad
taste. “Good bad taste,” he_says, “has
wit and irony. Bad taste has neither.”
Good bad taste is Waters’ forte. He
says he makes such grotesque films
to amuse himself and to allow his au-
dience to laugh at their own worst fears
as well as things whichthey are unable
to change. Waters himself is not in-
terested in changing anything despite
the extremely harsh light in which he
casts some of America’-s more repul-
sive characteristics. ‘‘If everything was
good and fair in America, I wouldn’t'
have any subject matter,” he says.
Tonight at Filmmakers at the Fulton
Waters will be on hand to screen The
Diane Linkletter Story, a 1970 black
and white atrocity starring Divine as
Diane, Tribute to Edie, a charmin_g por-
trait of Edith Massey by Robert Maier
and the feature Polyester in Odorama,
a scratch and sniff (odor cards pro-
vided) homage to 3-D, Sensurround
and William Castle. lt’s the story of a
disturbed suburban housewife, Fran-
cine Fishpaw (Divine), whose husband
runs a porno theater and is cheating

on her while her daughter is an unwed-

 

  

 l   

mother-to-be (punk Stiv Bators done _’ 
the deed), her son is a psychotic_glue- L’ ,

sniffing JD and a would-be suitor, Tod
Tomorrow (Tab Hunter), is an utter
knave after far more than Divine’s_

luscious bod. lt’s a bit slicker (read .-

more expensive) and tamer than
Waters’ earlier films, but his caricatur-
ing of suburban desperation, the anti-

abortion lunatic fringe and teen-age. _

rebellion are highpoints in his oeuvre.
lt’s also one of Waters’ most
thematically coherent works. Wafting
up from this cinematic stench is a
pungent, if not downright vicious,
satire of bourgeois/suburban values.

. Plus the man himself will be there in

all his pimp mustachloed glory. I know
l’l| be there or wherever he sets up his

mobile absurdist altar, so I can drink C
from his overflowing gutter of a mind, .

a mind from which flows a decadently
positive affirmation of the American
way.

' After threeyears of silence, Biafra,
known to many as the undefeated
champion of hardcore, has much to
say here, and he doesn’t let you forget
it for a second. The issues addressed
are as follows: automation, the cor-
poration, alienation, education, pover-
ty, war, corruption, high school
sports  need I go on? Take my word
for it, the music on Frankenchrist has
quite an edge and it sounds great after
a hard day’s work.

I D.O.A. on their latest, Let’s Wreck the
Party, again proves that there’s more
to Canada than Loverboy and Triumph
and Rush. This record is for people

who like their music rowdy and loud,
with a big guitar sound. lt’s straight
rock ‘n’ roll with occasional metal over-
tones and a lot of fooling around.
The Circle Jerks, long a favorite on
both coasts, have released this, their
fourth recording, with the addition of
Zander Schloss on bass. There is not
a lot of new sound here, except they

are an even tighter and better band. g

This one is simply fast and wild rock
music —— the way it should be played.
The title track “Wonderful” is one of
the strongest, and includes the Las
Palmas-La Canada Children’s Choir to
effectively harmonize within the
chorus. The rest is driven “metalized”

punk with a cocky attitude and very
distinctive, almost funny lead vocals by
ex-Black Flager Keith Morris.

You probably won’t find any of these
records in the National Record Mart,
but they’re out there. They are often
found in smaller stores that carry in-
dependents and imports. If you spend

descending pen, I would be able to
start my own article.

Let me ask you a simple question:
Why is it so important for you to
evaluate music?

In a world withso many different
trends and styles what could you
possibly hope to accomplish? I see you
as a man leading his own cult saying,
“My way or bust.” I

Don’t you know what poetry is for

hope you will consider your audience
more carefully. I’m sure thereare more
people that share my opinion.

Adam Eisenstat’s travel report about
Germany stinks. I expected an infor-
mative collection of impressions, and
I was very disappointed. I ' rather
wanted to hear about the opinions and
lifestyles of the people of East Berlin.
Instead, I read about Eisenstat’s cheap
provocation with the Schnapps bottle.

Oktoberfest is fun. But at the same
time last fall, an entire nation looked
at Wackersdorf. where thousands
rallied against a nuclear recycling fac-
tory. There, Eisenstat could have dealt
more with Germans who hardly care
about “clean cars.” ‘ .

Instead of exploring the exciting
German music scene, he tells us about

_ homegrown American bands perform-

ing in Munich. Hell, that’s what travel-
ing is all about, isn’t it?

Eisenstat’s babble fits too well what
I have experienced on campus.
Whenever I identify myself as a Ger-
man intern, I hear the same stupid
questions: Do you really have no
speed limit on the autobahn? How
good is the German beer? Do you
have McDonalds, too? (|’ll save you
the rest.) The lack of knowledge here
about political and cultural life in Ger-
many is tremendous.

Eisenstat had the chance to_
describe Deutschland beyond the
common cliches. He missed the train-
On the top of it, his article is illustrated
with a map, showing a big black arrow
pointing from the Soviet Union to Ger-
many. Sure, the Russians are coming,
and Adam’s “Continental Blitzkrieg,
Part I’,’ will save Germany. Frankly,
right now I’m more concerned about
such American ignorance.

HAWKSMOOR

. by Peter Ackroyd

Harper and Row
By George Kresak

“There is no Light without Darkness
and no Substance without Shad-
dowe.” So speaks Nicholas Dyer, 18th
century baroque architect, whose
highest passion is that of terror. He
queries further, “What Life is there
which is not a Portmanteau of Shad-
dowe and Chimeras?” At once
energetic, eloquent and mordantly
haunting, Dyer’s brilliantly-crafted nar-
rative voice (given expression through
half of the book) never strays far from
the nature of evil and corruption as
Peter Ackroyd weaves a somber, in-
tricately plotted tale of murder.

Hawksmoor is a spirited novel of
ideas: the drama at its heart unfolds
assuredly around the central intellec-

tual conflict subsisting between those
who, like Dyer and his fellow devil wor-
shippers, embrace arcane medieval
nations, and those who believe, like
Christopher Wren (Dyer’ssuperior and
chief antagonist), in the primacy of
reason. Dyer and his compatriots,
adamantly denying any virtue in the
ideas of the Enlightenment, trust to
Satan and his demon hordes to protect
them from the ravages of evil. On the
other hand, Wren and his fellows at the
Royal Society frown haughtily at idle
superstitiousness and proclaim
zealously that the mysteries of our
world may be comprehended finally
and utterly only through rationality and
the scientific method. It is perhaps a
measure of Ackroyd’s skill that Dyer’s
mad voice, in its rhetorical brilliance,
is so utterly convincing: One is apt to
believe with Dyer that man “will
mistake the Candle of his reason for

By Stan Thomas Wozniak

Things aren’t going well for Emma
Moriarty. She’s a divorced mother
who’s moved to back-roads Arizona
with her 12-year-old son in hopes of
beginning a new life. Although she’s
whipped her ranch into shape, ready
to board and train horses, she’s run in-
to major financial difficulties. When
she turns to the townspeople, it’s
without success. The local loan officer
won’t lend her any money because
she’s a woman, towhich Emma (Sally
Field) luminously counters: “l’d work
on the streets, but you only have one.”
The town pharmacist (James
Garner) offers her son (Corey Haim) a
job," and Emma finds something
strangely attractive about this man
who is nearly 30 years older than she.
The picture is blurred even further
when Emma’s ex-husband Bobby
Jack (Brian Kerwin) shows up, sweeps

_ their son off his feet, and wants to

resume residence. in the meantime,
Murphy, who’s purchased a horse and

keeps it at Emma’s place, begins to .

recognize her as a woman with a heart
of gold.

This down-home love triangle has
other complications (Murphy is Em-
ma’s idea of a gentleman, whereas
Bobby Jack is younger, more attrac-
tive, but a “son-of-a-bitch”). But direc-

’ tor Martin" Ritt (Cross Creek, Norma

Rae) has more of an eye for the land-

Dean Youngblood, an

' By Lori F aiella

The trend for movies which appeal
to our competitive nature continues
with Youngblood, a film about one
*boy’s dream to become a professional
hockey player.

Dean Youngblood grew up on a ‘

rather desolate farm in New Stanton.

_;Throughout his 17 years he had one

dream: to make the pros. In
Youngblood, you get to witness his first-
class determination, his struggles, his
clash with defeat and ultimately his
success. ‘

Youngblood (Rob Lowe) gets his first

~ chance to really play when the coach
, of a Canadian team, Coach Chadwick

(Ed Lauter) chooses him, over several
other contestants. He is’ chosen, not

scape than he does for a well-balanced
love story. Yet in Murphy’s Romance
there is a sense that he’s willing to let
nature take its toll: a few lighthearted
surprises, and a couple of scenes that
could not be funnier or warmer. When
a square dance forces the three to con-

front one another, and it’s clear Emma
can’t make up her mind, the men end

up two-stepping around the floor. And
when Murphy treats Emma to a game
of bingo with the town folk, she lights
up the screen in an innocent celebra-
tion after winning $200.

But Murphy’s Romance has against
it a screenplay (by Harriet Frank Jr.
and Irving Ravetch) that sometimes
fights with the film’s original intentions.
There are some wonderful moments
written into the script, but there are
also dead spots in some unusual

places. Emma visits Murphy’s
drugstore several times, but it is not

apparent what purpose her visits
serve, if any. Love is in the air," but flirt-
ing for nonsense does not thicken the
plot. '

_ Yet the film is cast beautifully. It may

 
 

, Showcase, February 14, _19.86

Slly Field makes Murphy’s  Acquaintance 

be somewhat unbelievable that Mur-
phy and Emma could fall in love, but
James Garner's performance is nice-
ly executed, and throughout the film

we do not actually see them fall in love.
Instead, we’re offered the perimeters
of the relationship and, at the film's
c|imax,.we’re permitted to draw our
own conclusions. Garner's up for an
Oscar in this role, and deservedly so.
Sometimes warm, sometimes cold, his
portrayal" of Murphy is human, sen-
sitive and engaging. As Field’s ex-
husband, Brian Kerwin (who looks like
he could be Robert R'edford’s kid
brother) also turns in a clean
Derformance. *

But this is Sally Field’s baby — she
had a hand in choosing the story from
a Max Schott novella and served as
executive producer. Add this to her list
of tough, tender, hard-working per-
formances, and she could be the re-
cipient of a ‘Sissy Spacek award for get-'
ting her hands in the dirt. But in Mur-
phy’s Romance there’s a side to Sally

 F/X— Fast X—citement

By Eric Glick

Robert Mande|’s new film F/X is just
about the most fun you can have with
$4. The film doesn’t answer any great
metaphysical or philosophical ques-
tions of our lifetime, but F/X is just what
it sets out to be — a good, action-

-packed, plot-twisting mystery, com-

plete with villainous, unsuspecting
heroes and a complete medley of
special effects. ,

Australian actor Bryan Brown stars
as Rollie Tyler, a special effects expert
who becomes the. pawn in a
mysterious murder case initiated by
the Justice Department. Brown, whose
screen credits include Breaker Morant
(for which he won an Australian
Academy Award) and The Chant of
Jimmie Blacksmith, does an admirable
job portraying the average man
pushed into an event that alters his
future life. He is sharp, witty and has
a keen sense of timing.

Brian Dennehy, who portrays Lt.
Murdoch, the detective obsessed with
Tyler’s case, should be given credit
also. Dennehy, who some may
rememberfrom Cocoon and “10,” is
one of those performers whose
presence in a film helps create a finer
sense of realism.

Worth mentioning also is Joe Grifasi,

who Bortraxs MUrd0Ch’S bumbling no control. It turns out that he does a

 50th Anniversary Celebration

sidekick Mickey. He provides comic
relief, and his light performance
reminds the viewer he is only watching
a movie. There is an especially hyp-
notic chase sequence featuring Grifasi
crashing and smashing through
several carcasses of “dressed” lamb.
This scene was coordinated by Gary
Davis, who created the stunning chase
sequence in Against All Odds.

The film’s shortcomings are few,
but they are visible. Martha Gehman,

_ who plays Tyler’s right-hand assistant,

is attractive, but unfortunately, her
technique fails to be constructed as
convincing. In fact, her presence is
seemingly unnecessary.

So what is F/X (which stands for
“special effects”)? lt’s not a roller-
coaster ride, but it is entertaining
nonetheless. This is one of a few films
which utilize the medium of special il-
lusionary techniques and an unusual
plot structure. That is the reason why
it deserves a glance. it is such a
refreshing change to see bad guys
who are not concerned with karate tac-
tics and mind games but are on our
side. Yes, the Justice Department is
not as squeaky clean as some would
think. And the hero is not even
American. He’s just an earthy guy who
takes his work seriously and en-
counters a situation over which he has

. wonderful job at overcoming impossi-

ble odds. lt’s also nice to see an in-
telligent film that challenges mundane
plot structures and delivers more for
your entertainment dollar.

F/X is not an overly pertinent film,
but it affords some interesting ideas

Youngblood

continued from page 12

rivalry sparks between Youngblood
and Racki, a player for ' the com-
petitor’s team who had been over-
thrown by Youngblood during the
draft. This personal vendetta frequent-
ly recurs throughout the film. Racki is
responsible for his first injury and for
the decision to forfeit his lifelong
dream. With the help of his brother, his
father and a few training sessions,
Dean returns to the ice like a tornado,
ready and able to blow away his adver-
saries, including Racki,

in some places Youngblood is a lit-
tle too predictable. You know that he
is going to make it. However, the en-
ding contains a few touches that ease
the ‘‘I knew it” feeling.

Rob Lowe is basically good as the
confused, naive farm lad -who

and visual excitement for the viewer.
Those of us who had the chance to see
Remo Williams and liked it will no doubt
find delight in this endeavor. F/X may
be an early spring flower amongst
many dreary pebbles of cinematic
manure.

 ‘
becomes a tougher, more determined

man. He “knows” what he wants and
will not easily toss his dreams to the
wind. The relationships between Dean
Youngblood and his main team, his
father, brother, best friend on the
team, Dereck (Patrick Swayze) and his
girlfriend, Jessie Chadwick (Cynthia
Gibb), are realistically and convincingly

‘portrayed. You can understand the

love that inspires him to glide and
swish for the hopes of fulfilling his
fantasy.

Like many films which focus on
sports, Youngblood is not only about
winning, it’s about summoning deter-
mination and strength inside oneself to
make the grades. The final scenes of
the movie — the final play, the last few
seconds and the eager faces of the
crowd — create the pressured climax
that “could” satisfy his aspirations.

Youngblood might not take the cup, ,
‘but there are plenty of laughs to be had

—— in the locker room and out on the
town. Expect the expected.

modern voodoo storyteller

THE BIG HEAT
Stan Ridgway
I.R.S. Records

Once lead singer of Wall of Voodoo,
Stan Ridgway has re-emerged on vinyl
with a superb debut solo effort. The Big
Heat delivers powerful, funny and
mysterious songs that all seem to wor_k
on their own levels. And despite the
diversity of moods Ridgway creates,
and the different producers he
employs — four different teams in all
— this record is amazingly coherent

and has stunning impact.

While his former musical outfit has
turned to a bigger, bombastic sound to
drive their lyrical messages home,
Ridgway relies on a variety of

. keyboard textures which are given

dynamic flash by different solo in-
struments. Some musical highlights in-

-clude a violin and harmonica trading
_ solos at the close of the title track, The

Minutemen’s bassist Mike Watt pop-
ping away on “Can’t Stop The Show”
and the flutelike sounds emanating
from the emulator used on
“Salesman.” Ridgway himself proves
quite the instrumental renaissance
man, playing harmonica, keyboards,
bass, guitar and banjo at various
times. On guitar, his David Gilmour-
esque riffs and rich, twangy picking

add to “Can’t. Stop The Show” and
“Drive, She Said,” respectively.

Ridgway’s skillfully created musical
landscapes serve as perfect settings
for his quirky talk-singing of the lyrics
to his songs. The vision of a cheap
burlesque house in “Can’t Stop The
Show” is at once pathetic and
humorously queer; while the owner
tells each of his girls You ’re a showgirl,
not a whore, the stage act features
Betsy in her birthday suit, spinnin’ her
baton. “Drive, She Said” sounds like
a twisted rendering of Harry Chapin’s
“Taxi Driver,” with Ridgway’s narrator
driving a threatening woman bank rob-
ber to her getaway boat at the pier, but
not before dreaming of the two of them
on some kinda tropical island
someplace, wa/kin’ down a white,
sandy beach eatin’ something. When
Ridgway sings that things are never
quite the way they seem, in
“Camouflage,” he gets twice the nor-
mal mileage one might get from the
play on the single word title —— the big
Marine that saves the singer in a jungle
fight proves to be the ghost of a recent-
ly killed soldier.

Practically every song from The Big
Heat deserves mention. The sad,

‘melodic “Walkin’ Home Alone” and

the futuristic detective story of the ti-
tle song stand out as well as the
aforementioned cuts. But journalistic

listings and descriptions of Stan
Flidgway’s smart musical vignettes
hardly do them justice. This original
modern-day storytel|er’s record truly
deserves listening. From the evocative
industrial scenes depicted on the

~ is-~~—t—*smweasa',' Fésruaryﬁz, - 1986*

record sleeve, to the strange, exciting
scenes Ridgway’s lyrics create, The
Big Heat is a unique, adventurous
album well worth discovering.

JOHN YOUNG

—Super-Mental-

FUNDAMENTAL
Mental as Anything
Columbia

Mental as Anything toured America
with fellow Aussies Men at Work in

1982, riding the crest of a small but'fiz-
zy wave of enthusiasm generated by
a splendid single called ‘‘If You Leave
Me, Can I Come Too?” Sadly, the
song, and the band, failed to captivate
the American public as Men at Work

, had, and they returned to Australia,
down but not yet out.

They now have a new record, called
Fundamental. lt’s not bad but it isn’t
extremely good either.

Here's the problem: Nowhere is the
failure of pure democracy more evi-
dent than in rock bands that try to
divide up songwriting chores equally
among their members. Allof the non-

drumming members of Mental as
Anything (there are four of them) wrote
two or three songs for this LP, and the
quality of the material fluctuates
accordingly.

The best songwriter in the band is
easily Greedy Smith, whose songs
best represent the sound to which
Mental as Anything aspire: pleasant,
fun, slightly zany pop a la Squeeze.

(Squeeze, in fact, is the group’s admit-
ted inspiration.) Smith’s song, “You’re
So Strong,” a refreshing draught of
zippy groove nectar, opens side one
and is the record’s best. It deserves
airplay.

Smith is followed by Martin Plaza,
who writes slightly more ambitious and
slightly less successful material. If the
band let Smith write most of the songs
and Plaza the remainder, they could
more fully realize their potential. Un-
fortunately, there are two other writers
in the band, Peter O’Doherty and Reg
Mombassa, whose songs are weak
and uninspired. ’

Aside from that, the only otherﬂprﬂob-H

lem with Fundamenta/-era Mental as
Anything is their flagrant and shallow
imitation of Squeeze (the cover design,
for one thing, is straight from the inner
sleeve of Argybargy), but that’s all
right, really, since-l’ve always thought
there should be more bands like
Squeeze anyway. ’

Fundamental falls short of being a
pop classic, but there are worse ways
you could spend a few bucks. Check
it out with caution. ‘

Ten Unsigned
—Recordings—-

EPIC PRESENTS THE UNSIGNED
Various Artists
Epic

Diversity over continuity seems the
theme of all too many soundtrack
albums and various artists’ collections.
Compilers Robert K. Habler and
Joanne Abbot Green come closer than
ma'ny by collating a cohesive package
with Epic Presents The Unsigned. But

as an effort to satisfy every |istener’s

tastes, they obviously misplaced
several klunkers. Epic’s search for the
10 best unsigned American bands
pays off with a variety of first-rate cuts
mingled among less worthwhile efforts.

Sounding like a laidback Roman
Holiday, the Sussman Lawrence Band
opens Unsigned with their horn and
vibelike keyboard-laden “Torture Me.”
After their smooth masochistic pleas,
The Reducers come chugging along
with their super slice of pop punk,
“Let’s Go.” Then, the speedy, flanged,

\

guitar rocker, “Where The Cowboys
Went,” from The Pressure Boys,
disrupts side one by sounding like an
obscure inside joke. The Rothchilds
revive things, though, on the LP’s
standout cut, “Long After Summer,” a
pure, melodic piano- and organ-
dominated pop song. And The
Criminals close things out with the
bland, metalish “Under The City
Lights.”

Side two has a wider range of acts
and far less impact than the first side.

Blue Sparks From Hell revive the ’50s
ballad form on the pleasant but forget-
table “Real Man’s Car,” followed by
The Radiators’, “This Wagon’s Gonna
Roll,” a country-toned, truck drivin’
song built around a single repetitive
riff. The Crime scores the side’s
coolest cut with their carefree 1980s
brand of early ’60s rock ‘n’ roll,
demonstrated on “Mad About You.”
Visions sound like any other mediocre
urban _dance music band, despite a
talented female lead vocalist, on “Love
Potion.” Free World closes the record
with boring electro-techno instrumen-
tal ramblings which comprise “Supply
And Demand.” 4

Epic had an outstanding idea in col-
lecting songs from unsigned bands for
a compilation record. But otherthan

these groups being American, very lit— ‘

tle bonds most of them together. If the
songs from The Reducers, The Crime
and The Rothchilds are any indication,
Epic certainly could have found _a full
complement of great progressive
rock/pop bands to fill out their record.
As it stands, Epic Presents The
Unsigned features some fine music
and has its moments, but fails to en-
thrall from groove to label on either
side.

RIPTIDE
Robert Palmer
Island Records

If you get the chance, take a look at
the Webster’s Dictionary definition of
“white soul poseur.” Accompanying
that definition should be a photograph
of Robert Palmer. On his new album,
Riptide, he often lives up to his dubious

reputation by delivering his usual

quota of lifeless ballads and bland
funk. But what’s unusually frustrating
about this release is that Palmer does
catch fire on at least two occasions.
One has to (wonder if he lacks inspira-
tion or is just lazy.

- The problem can’t be his cast of ses-
sion musicians. Among the list of
heavyweights are Andy Taylor, Tony
Thompson and-producer Bernard Ed-
wards, all fresh from Palmer's stint
with the Power Station. These players
make up a tight ensemble and the
drum-heavy mix is ready-made for FM
radio. So what’s gone wrong?

Mistake number-one was the re-
lease of the single, “Addicted to
Love.” The song clocks in at over six
minutes but seems to last longer than
the live version of “Free Bird.” This is
unmelodic white funk at its worst and
is unfortunately typical of most of the
album’s fast numbers. The shining ex-

' ception to these unsoulful workouts is

 

‘‘I Didn't Mean to Turn You On.” Here,
Palmer is wonderfully snotty and Ber-
nard Edwards lays down a smoldering
bass line which could instantly fill a
dance floor.

The only other time Palmer hits the
mark is with his impassioned vocal on
“Hyperactive.” This track's full-scale
fuzz guitar and synth attack is irresisti-
ble. If released as a-single, “Hyper-
active” could provide him with his first
FM radio success (as a solo artist)

since “Bad Case of Loving You.” Far
more typical of his mediocrity is “Get
it Through Your Heart,” an unemo-

tionally-rendered love song that col- A

lapses under the weight of its own
unbearable sentimentality.

Because Robert Palmer shows oc-
casional signs of true inspiration on
Riptide, there is a chance that he could
deliver a’ satisfying work in the near
future. He definitely has gifts as a

vocalist but needs to choose material
that excites him and pushes him
towards genuine expression. But until
then, his listeners must suffer through
Riptide, which just sounds like another
bland Robert Palmer album

THE ULTIMATE SIN
Ozzy Osbourne
CBS Associated Records

Late last night, my cassette of Ozzy
Osbourne's The Ultimate Sin wound
down to its conclusion. As my tape
player clicked off, I awoke from a
magical dream. I dreamed that I had
stood in red platform shoes at the end
of a long yellow brick road. My little
dog, Toto, stood nervously at my side.
A great wizard named Ozzy stood
before me and I spoke humbly to him,
“I have come seeking heavy metal that
is both passionate and intelligent.” Oz-
zy laughed in a most sinister fashion
and said, “Look elsewhere, you fool!"
And then he bit off Toto’s head.

FALCO 3
Falco
A&M Records

The good news: Falco’s “Rock Me

Showcase, February 14, 19S6

 ECO   “*5

Amadeus” is 1986’s first big dance hit,
a premium Yuppie wet dream of a
song frolicking with a strut, filled with
synthesizer pushes and pulls that
would have Amadeus doing cart-
wheels in his grave. It's just a gimmick
thouqh, however irresistible, with a
bass line stolen straight- from Queen’s
“We Will Rock You.” Dubbed and
overdubbed again, it pulsates with the
same kind of dance floor venom as
“Der Komissar" or “Puttin’ on the
Ritz,” with Falco’s delivery quivering
toward an excitable pitch but chafing
with a misguided sensibility of guess-
ing when to scream and when to
whisper.

The bad news: The rest of Fa/co 3,
overproduced and melodramatic, is
even worse. Besides the rhythmic
“Vienna Calling” (which is too long),
the thundering edge of “Tango The
Night” (which is too short), and the
quick beat behind “Any Kind of Land
(Manner Des Westens)," the album is
a disappointment.

If Fa/co 3 is nothing but the result of
a record company's forcing an album
from an artist who’s only worth a hit
single, then the trappings of the album
may not be entirely Fa|co's fault. The
album version of “Rock Me Amadeus”
is not the one you hear on B-94 (the
single) nor the one you hear on WAMO
(the 12 inch), just a haphazard remix.
You might be able to dance to one ver-
sion of “Rock Me Amadeus,” but the
rest of Fa/co 3 will put your feet to
sleep.

Oh Venus. send me someone
to love  — Shocking B/ue

Yes, it’s Valentine’s Day 1986.

Another holiday — another opportuni-

ty to just look back and get some
perspective on life, another time to buy
gifts for those special people in our
lives 

’s guide f

      

 

r Valentines

So, what does one buy for this big
day of love? A Hallmark will always put
its sender in a good light, but cards are
so meaningful, right? No, something
special is needed. A dozen roses for
a sweetheart is truly the classic gift for

that special someone, but not too =

original. A box of Godiva chocolates is
nice, but soon consumed and soon
forgotten.

After careful research and discus-
sion on this matter of Valentine gifts,
one must first wonder what is really be-
ing celebrated on Feb. 14 in order to
know what gift to give. Now, i can
remember a rather robust nun giving
me a story about a St. Valentine when
I was in grade school. But later, several
other characters were introduced.
There was Cupid, a young kid flying
around in a diaper shooting love ar-
rows. Back in classical times there was
Venus, the Roman goddess of love. So
who is really being honored?

It seems to me that the only way to
figure out who deserves credit on

.,’ ,2; 3’ ., .,_,_( ..;  ..’
' 4?» .-9 .+.- .—..‘ 1%.’ I

Valentine’s Day and what gift is most
appropriate on said day, is to discuss
the motivation behind said gift. Cards,

flowers and all the rest are given, and ‘

accompanied by vowsof never-ending
love. These sentiments of passion are
as sincere as knowing that somebody
really cared by sending the very best
— Hallmark. As humans, we give gifts
expecting something in return. lwon’t
say what I think most people expect
after making that extra special Valen-
tine’s Day effort. l’ll just let you figure
out what people desire, by stating what
the most popular Valentine’s Day gift
IS.

lt’s underwear! Yes, underwear, but
not the kind your mom buys you at

Jacques C. Pennie. For the ladies, it’s’
’ a hot, red-lace teddie (white, if you just

met the recipient), with matching den-
tal floss undies. For the guys, it’s what
amountsjto a shoestring and a sock
(often with a heart in a strategic place).
To be the chic Valentine gift-giver,
forego the traditional chocolates and

long-stemmed roses. Just stop by
Drawers, and get the gift that keeps
giving and going, on and on, ’til
Christmas. At that time, hearts turn to
Santa's caps and socks turn to sacks.

We’ve answered the second ques-
tion of what to give, but we’ve yet to
answer for whom. I don’t think St.
Valentine would want to be celebrated
with the giving and getting of satin and
edible fibers, so we’ll count him out.
Cupid and Venus are in the love
business, and most Valentine gift-
givers aren’t into that stage. They may,
however, be using this day as a
stepping-stone to reach that amorous

state. No, lthink there’s an unherald- ‘ ‘ "

ed being for whom we celebrate Valen-
tine’s Day — St. Lust.

Just as Sting serenades a French
mistress named Roxanne, so too we
honor our sweethearts with a Valen-
tine. Just don’t commit the faux pas of
seeing lust as love lest we a heart in

our pants than an heart on our sleeves.

Happy Valentine’s Day!

regards with contempt the ideas and

Eliot’s affection for the richly ornate

Showcase; February '14, 1986

By David Zuchowski

Contrary to popular opinion,
“classic”,status for composers and
their music is not something stamped
on them upon birth or composition.
Similar to classic literary stat-us, it is
often something that is achieved for
an artist after many years of hard sell--
ing on the part of certain well-
respected “fans” and organizations
dedicated to the preservation and ap-
preciation of his work.

The Bach Choir of Pittsburgh began
as an organization dedicated to the
preservation of the works of Johann
Sebastion Bach, after a succession of
other such organizations. It began with
Mendelssohn’s performance of The St.
Matthew Passion in the early 1800s
and in 1850 with the Bach

Gesellschraft organization, formed in I

Germany, to find, collect and publish
Bach’s work in a complete edition. The
task, however, is to this day unfinish-
ed. For example, of 300 known church

Cantatas by Bach, about 100 are still‘

missing.

The Bach Choir of Pittsburgh has
been studying, performing and
disseminating Bach’s works to the
public since 1934. Later, Bach’s
music, which at the time of his death
was thought by many to be too intellec-
tual and old-fashioned, took on a life
of its own. Although it still concentrates
on Bach, the choir has diversified, and
it. performs a variety of other artists’
work.

The Bach Choir’s next performance
with the Pittsburgh Brass Quintet at
the Church of the Ascension on Tues-
day is something offbeat for them in
that no Bach pieces will be performed.
Instead, the concert, entitled “Glorious
Voices and Gleaming Brass,” will in-
troduce works by Heinrich Schultz, R.
Vaughn Williams and’John Rutter.

Schultz (1585-1672) was a 17th-
century composer who held the posi-
tion of Maestro di Capella at the
Lutheran Church in Dresden. He
studied with Monteverdi and the
Gabrielle at St. Marks in Venice.
Although Monteverdi was one of the
earliest composers of opera, Schultz
avoided opera composition and opted

instead to apply the “new, style”.
musical principles of Monteverdi to

sacred music. The “new style” was
essentially non-contrapuntal and made
use of recitative and monodyne, one-
line settings of literary texts with a con-

tinuo accomplishment.

Schultz wrote mainly religious and
vocal works varying from small solo
pieces to compositions for two or three
voices and two or three instruments to

large double choruses with brass and
organ accompaniment. According to
Max Peterson, music director and con-
ductor of the Bach Choir as well as

» director of choral activities at CMU, he

is “generally considered to have writ-
ten the most sensitive musical settings
for the German language. His musical
expression is very appropriate to the
stress and structure .of German, mak-
ing Schultz’ music very hard to sing in
translation. The choir will sing three of
Schultz’ motets, and translations of the
texts will be made available to the au-
dience. Peterson goes on to add that
“someone with a smattering of Ger-
man could better appreciate the rela-

tionship of the music to the works that .

Schultz so masterfully crafted.”
Bach, too, was concerned with
Iariguage, but most often his musical

"structure takes precedence over the

language content. With Schultz the
language dictates the musical idea.
With Bach, beyond the first germ of an
idea gotten from the text, the flow of
the musical composition takes
precedence over everything else.
Also on the program is Ralph
Vaughn Williams’ unaccompanied
Mass in G Minor, a full mass setting for
double chorus and four soloists, writ-
ten around 1920. Much of the com-
position, disregarding the harmonic
content, was taken from an early
polyphonic mass setting of the 16th
century. Very much a contrapuntal
piece, it’s also very much in the style
of Vaughn Williams; the harmonic
direction has the modal flavor of which
he was so fond. Peterson describes

G.B. ’s column (God  what am

._ /saying?). _

Pat Benatar: Sex as a Weapon——

The idea of sex being used as a
weapon is an interesting concept, and
it might have made an interesting
song. Unfortunately, in the hands of
Benatar’s hubby Neil Geraldo, the idea

‘ is thrown about without any intelligent

consideration whatsoever.—(Are you
surprised?) Stupid, stupid, stupid.

the Mass as a “luscious, gorgeous
piece.”

The final concert offering will be the
Gloria by contemporary English com-
poser John Flutter, who writes primarily
for the church. His works are not what

can be called experimental, but they’re g

definitely accessible to the modern
listener. The piece is written in three
movements with brass (trumpets, three
trombones and a tuba), organ, tym-

pani, xylophone and glockenspiel. The
first and last movements are quick,
festive and brassy in the best sense of

_ the word and build to wonderful, full

ensemble climaxes and are
characterized by some interesting
rhythmic motives. The middle move-
ment is quieter and more reserved and

' is marked andante. The accompani- .

ment features the organ but also con-
tains some brass features. The Pitts-
burgh Brass Quintet will provide the
accompaniment to the Gloria as well as
play solo works by Victor Ewald, a
Scandinavian composer who lived in
Russia in the late 1800s..

The concert is at the Church of the
Ascension on the corner of Neville and
Ellsworth Avenues. Peterson finds the
acousticsin the church to be quite
good, which he attributes to its shape,
a factor he feels has more to do with
acoustical quality_ than does surface
material. “We don’t get a long
reverberation in the church. In other
similar buildings or chambers, a much-
delayed echo from the back of the
structures mixes with sounds
simultaneously produced in the front,
creating an auditory disastor.”

Petersort’s personal preference for
seating at the concerts is one half to
three quaters of the way to the back
of the church. “The frontal areatends
to _get below the sounds produced by
the back sections of the orchestra and
the back rows of the choir. But about
halfway back and beyond, you tend to
get a whole- or full-ensemble sound.”

In the spring of 1987, the Bach Choir
will perform the St. Matthew Passion
in its entirety, not the edited and

-shortened versionso often performed.

Peterson feels that “with some care
and detailed attention to the dramatic
content, to the flow of the piece without
the lugubrious interpretation of the
18th century and with appropriate tem-
pi, the piece can turn out to be a
magnificent experience.”

creative brainpower. Their second LP,
“The Lexicon of Love,” was a master-
piece of modern rock, not by virtue of
its songs, but via Trevor Horn’s brilliant
production. Since leaving Horn’s nest,
though, ABC’s records have dipped_ in
quality, predictably enough, but Mar-

- tin Fry and company know plenty of

production tricks that continue to snare
them hits. Without the state-of-the-art
sound effects, “(How to Be a)
Millionaire” would be an absolute
nothing of a song. As it is, it isn’t much.

Self-refercia|ity:RobertArneson’s Politics in Art

By Shaun Martin

Viewing the art of Robert Arneson
can be an awakening experience.
California artist addresses today’s im-
portant issues and forces his viewers
to be aware, if not in concordance, with
his beliefs. There is no ambiguity, no
uncertainty, as to what Arneson stands
for. He is a political _activist through art,
and he’s voicing his opinions now
through March 16 at the Pittsburgh
Center for the Arts, 6300 Fifth Ave.
This exhibition, entitled “Robert
Arneson: Points of View,” is part of an
ongoing city-wide series on politics in
art, entailing many forms such as
painting, sculpture, film and video.

As one enters this exhibition, he is
greeted by a ceramic bust entitled
“Sorts.” Like many of his works,
Arneson uses himself as the subject
claiming himself to be a cheap model.
This is the bust of humanity, not of a
man. Both the multicolored base and
the disfigured head appear to have
been constructed from pieces of many

‘shattered sculptures, testifying to

mankind’s own fragmentation. The
head is cocked to one side as if it is
trying to pull itself free from the base.

possible. “She Sells Sanctuary” is
nice alliteration but that doesn't make
for compelling vinyl. At least hardcore

‘bands have some claim to writing

songs about things. This is just noise
for noise’s sake.

forehead while the other half, in the ad-
jacent fragment, is mottled with
discolored spots. One ear is clamped
in a vice while the other is free. One
eye stares at us blindly while the other
is completely absent. This piece
reminds us of the conflict in the world
and our inability to cohabitate the world
peacefully with others of our own
species. It serves as aprelude to the
rest of the show. ,

“Balder Dash-Dash” is another
ceramic bust, again with Arneson’s
own image apparent. This piece por-
trays a grotesque man, both physical-
ly and mentally. The head is twisted at
a strained angle. His tongue hangs out
of his contorted mouth while his eyes
gaze in wild agony. What makes this
piece so interesting is the use of
layers. The outer skin, beard and lips
are all of a red-brown color and seem
to encase a living human being rather
than being a living part of a man. The
eyelids, eyes, tongue and a second set
of lips are all flesh-colored and are set
underneath the hard, lifeless, outer in-
tegument. With this two-layered tech-
nique, Arneson shows us a man in
conflict with himself. The real and
human inner self is trying to express
itself but is thwarted by its inanimate

heart and soul of Genesis was Mike
Rutherford and/or Tony Banks. After
hearing this, Rutherford’s first post-
Genesis solo project, l’m thinking that
Genesis must have been all Tony
Banks. “Silent Running” sounds like
neutered Genesis or (I didn’t think it
was possible.) watered-down Phil Col-
lins. Seems Rutherford wants a slice
0’ that mass market pie fo’ hisself.
Can’t say I blame him, but he could
have at least tried- harder. Has a nice
atmosphere though.

Clemons is the undisputed king of the
instrument (in rock ‘n’ roll). “You’re a

Clemons or Browne, But that’s fine
because it’s more polished f than
anything Clemons could have written,
and it’s peppier than anything Browne
could have written. I don’t know — I
like it, sort of. I- can’t tell you exactly
why. it’s contrived and custom-made

anyway it seems reasonably sincere
and, it has the playful zip, thanks to
Clemons’ sax, that has largely been
missing from the airwaves of late.

“Last Class Clown.” The entire draw-
ing is of an imposing face/mask, which
attempts to scare us. This brightly col-
ored “c|own,” depicted with free and
wild lines, demonic eyes, pointed teeth
and skewered nose, has the potential
to destroy the world with his mischief.
His gaping mouth spits forth the words
“nuclear war”
cloud ornaments his forehead. We are
his opponents whom he" is trying to
scare off from stopping his personal
war against mankind.

There are many other facets to
Arneson’s work. He, can be satirical, as
in “Colonel Nuke’s Lecture” or deep-
lylemotional, as in his two portraits of
artist Jackson Pollock. He is not only
concerned with global issues, but also
with local and individual problems.
This show presents us with a series of
five representations of assinated San
Franciso official Harvey Milk.

Although his work can be described -

as grotesque and morbid, it cannot be
called‘ pessimistic. When viewing his’
art, we are_made aware of many prob-
lems but we also realize that we have
the power to rectify them. He is sim-
ply giving a warning and not predicting
an inevitably bleak future. Our society
is troubled but not hopeless.

Enough rationalizations?

By Adam Eisenstat **

After a couple months in
Switzerland, Italy and Greece I made
my way back north. Destination:
Amsterdam. I was on a Greek island
End it took about four days including
two long train rides, two very long boat
rides and a few 10-hour stopovers in
some real wretched places. I spent
many hours among train station
trollops and wine-guzzling
gristleheads; and let me tell you,

there’s nothing like a five- or six-hour -

wait in a cavernous, fetid train station
to demystify a city or country.

I had already been in Amsterdam for
a couple days at the beginning of my
.f_<ip, but all I did was smoke hash, drink

r“““'Fleineken and watch peep shows.

There must be more to this town, I
thought, and my second stay there
proved it.

Amsterdam, as many of you may
already know, is a world-famous center
of decadence and open-air sleaze.
There’s no such thing as soft-core por-
nography there. Sex mills of all types
dot the quaint little streets and display
their exotic and very explicit wares
right in the windows.. Scenesof little
children riding bi-kes and playing in‘
front of porno theaters and sex shops
made me regret not having a camera.
In the red light district, where my hotel
was, entire streets and allies are lined
with rows of glass booths occupied by
scantily clad lasses of all shapes and
sizes sitting on stools, looking bored
and/or provocative. Their little cub-
byholes of pleasure are topped with,
what else? — red flourescent light. A
closed red curtain indicates that ser-
vicesare being rendered.

In Amsterdam, anything, yes
anything goes and goes and goes.
While browsing in the “sex museum,”
I saw an advertisement for a bandage
loft to rent, complete with all the trap-
pings.and drippings of an all out, fully
realized S&M fantasy.

The highlight of my sexual odyssey
in this town, however, was seeing a
live sex show featuring three spry,
well-endowed young women, an equal-

(IT): spry and well endowed ‘donkey and
“a couple of feisty German shepard
studs. It was a mind-blowing spectacle
of exhibitionist beastiality. I had no
idea that man’s best friend and the ar-
chetypal beast of burden were capable

of such lechery.

Drugs are also quite accessible in
this vice capital. Hash and grass are
sold legally in bars and coffee shops.
And if you go into a place with a mari-
juana leaf on its sign, all you have to
do is ask for a menu, yeah. a menu,

routinely approached me offering
heroin, cocaine and a vast array of
head candy.

But alas, man does not live on drugs
and sex alone, so I had to find other
diversions. No problem’. This tawdry"

haven of Heineken-hoisting Herren is_

rife with cultural amenities. There are

a couple English-speaking theaters, .

dozens of movie houses and inexpen-

' sive music clubs galore, especially in

the area known as Leidesplein, a short
tram ride from the city center.

One night I saw Arto Lindsey at the
Paradiso, a church turned concert hall.

_ Lindsey found the New York no—wave

band D.N.A. and now plays with an in-
credible band called the Ambitious

‘Lovers, who beat out an infectious mix

of African/Calypso rhythms, salsa, jazz
and booty-bristling funk. Lindsey, who
looks like a down and out physics pro-
fessor, walled, chortled, screeched
and occasionally made noise with a
twelve-string guitar. It was a very in-
teresting combination of vocal angst,
random guitar dissonance and crazed
funk. The next night I saw a. very
mediocre performance of Sam

and take your ‘pick. Streetpeddlers

and nasty?” “No thanks doll,” I said,
‘‘I just picked up a copy of ‘Mercenary .
Moppets’ so I’m set for the night.”

Thunders was‘ Thunders, exactly
what I expected. He came out in tux V
and tails playing “Pipeline” with that
oft-imitated loud and ‘tasteless guitar
style. Highlights included “Chinese
Rocks,” “Personality Crisis,” “Lonely
Planet Boy” and “Pills.” He also did
an unintentionally funny acoustic set
that included “Eve of Destruction” and
“Folsom Prison Blues.” The unfail-
ingly polite punks called Thunders out

. for two encores. The second time out,
he said in that unmistakable semi-
comatose N.Y. whine, “Ahh Amster-
dam, you’re always the same. You
never change,” and proceded to play
“Pipeline” once again.

A couple times I went to the world-
famous Milkweg of Milky Way'C|ub,
which is a multi-level entertainment
complex featuring bands, films,
videos, space cakes, bars and more.
The first time I went was on a Wednes-
day, and I saw some local lamos
masturbating with instruments. I was
not impressed. I went back on Satur-

ing a gas can, metal strips and other
found percussion. They were a puffing,
pounding, two-man pantheon of
rhythm.

After this, I saw the funniest, most
energetically venomous performer I’ve

ever seen — an English poet/come- _

dian. He was like Lenny Bruce without
the Heroin. He was fast —— god he was
fast. He later told me he slowed his

normal pace down for the benefit of the-

Dutch crowd. Extemporizing and
reciting on a wide range of topics from
macho to gore films to English political
arcana, he was a socio-political
dynamo with an amazing sense of
timimg and the visually jolting. He took
a can of soda water and squeezed it
from between his legs to dramatize his
poetic rant on macho. (‘,‘If you can't
beat us, run away,” went the refrain)
The last act was a three-piece band

‘of shirtless wonders with a taped

rhythm sectionwho played (no lie)
technometal. I don’t care how chunky
the chords are, if there’s no human
rhythm section the band’s gonna be

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

One of the main ingredients missing
in the Pitt football team’s recipe last
season was the big play. Pitt completed
the long pass about as often as — well,

  Sports

Genilla will be joined by quarter-

' backs Larry Wanke of Clev_eland’s

Benedictine High School and John
Rasp, a 6-6 local product from Norwin
High School.

Wanke passed for 3,045 yards and

34 touchdowns last season, while Rasp '

threw for 1,267 yards. Rasp will also

be tried at punter.

“It isn’t so much the big play we
wanted to add to the attack,” Gottfried
said, “because you never know how
many you’ll make. But we’ll open up
the offense.”

Rather than pinpoint Pitt’s weakness
to big-play offense, Gottfried would

rather put it in simpler terms — like
speed and skill.

According to Gottfried, Pitt’s two
wide receiver recruits have both traits.
Pitt signed wideouts Henry Tuten, a
6-0, 175-pounder from Camden, NJ . ,
and Hosea Heard. Heard, who sat out

ied signs 19 recruits

School in Valdosta, Ga. because of
disciplinary reasons, “is a good

receiver with great speed,” said‘

Gottfried.

Gottfried said the five defensive
backs recruited also were talented and
fast. .

The most famous of the defensive
backs is Marcus Washington, a 6-2,
195-pounder from Mobile, Ala. But
Washington is well known because his
brother Pat just happens to be the start-
ing quarterback at the University of
Auburn. If Pat's talent has_ indeed
rubbed off on Marcus, Pitt may have
found a blue-chipper.

Gottfried also appears to be disci-
plined in one area that his predecessors
were not — the kicking game. While
fonner head coaches Jackie Sherrill and

Foge Fazio did recruit a kicker now .
and then; they never would “waste_’ _

scholarships on punters. ‘

‘Pitt signed kicker Jeff Van Horne

and punter Eric Mathieson.

“Kicking is an area of the game
where I’m very dedicated to,” Gott-
fried said. “Both of the kickers we
brought in were recommended to us by
Ray Celhrey, a kicking instructor who
has camps. They will compete with the
kickers we already have.”

The Panthers already have talented,

running backs, but that’s not the reason
Gottfried only signed Steel Va1ley’s

Adam Walker and Doug Hetzler of —

North Hills High.

“We have good running backs com- ’

ing back,” Gottfried said, “but I think
number-wise, we’re not so solid.”

Pitt still has four scholarships re-
maining and will use them on recruits
who will make late visits.

Same old story   for Lady Panthrs

Lorraine Williams chipped in with 13
and 10 points, respectively.

The season is winding to a close and
the Lady Panthers haven’t shown much
improvement since Big East league
play began. Therefore, the obvious
question to Bruce involves the prospect
of lineup changes.

“It’s a possibility,” said Bruce.“I
haven’t thought about it a lot yet, but
it’s a possibility.” ' .

Pitt travels to Jamaica, N.Y. , tomor-
row afternoon to take on the St. J ohn’s
Express in a 2 pm. game. The Express
squeaked by Pitt at the field house
earlier in the year, 55-54. That contest
could have gone the other way, but
Kim Gannis missed a one-on-one with
four seconds left that would have given
the Lady Panthers the win.

St. John’s record stood at 16-6.

overall and 9-3 in the Big East going
into a Wednesday night contest at Prov-
idence. The Express is paced by senior
guard Jackie Smith, who averages 14.3
points per game. Sophomore forward
Ma Li-Na scores 10.8 ppg, while
junior forward-center Althea Yard
chips in 8.9 ppg for St. John’s.

According to Bruce. the Express will
be ready and waiting for Pitt. “St.
John’s is a good team. We gave them
all they could handle here and I know
they’ll be practicing real hard for us,”
he said.

ending the season a disappointing
5-5-1, and it left the school looking for
a new coach.
Pitt found a coach in Mike Gottfried,
and he completed his ﬁrst recruiting
class Wednesday on the national letter
of intent day with the signing of 19
players. And after reviewing Pitt’s
troubled 1985 season, the former
University of Kansas head coach opted
"’ to improve on Pitt’s weakness —
throwing and containing the pass —‘— by
signing three quarterbacks, two wide
receivers and five defensive backs.
“We felt that recent recruiting
classes had been heavy with linemen
the past two or three seasons,” said
Gottfried. “A lot of them redshirted,
so we went after mostly quarterbacks,
receivers and defensive backs. I’m
pleased and excited about this group of
athletes. We’ve helped our ball club.”

Wrestlers face another big challenge

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

A week has now past since the Pitt
wrestling team was beaten at the grasp
of the Penn State Nittany Lions 34-5.
The loss is the first setback the Pan-
thers have experienced this season. To
date, they‘ve rolled through their
schedule, posting an impressive 7-1-2
mark.

The roadblock team that Pitt collid-
ed with was no pussycat, as the Lions
are the nation’s fourth-ranked team.
The Penn State lineup showcases four
starters who are among the top 100
wrestlers in the nation. The score of the
match shows the difference in strength
between a top ﬁve team, Penn State,
and a No. 19 team, Pitt. The Panthers,
however, are looking to grow frorr1_t1ie

less than spectacular performance they
showed on the road in (un)Happy
Valley.

“It was kind of a humbling effect on
this team,” said 126-pound starter and
co-captain John Hnath. “It was the dif-
ference between a top ﬁve team and a
top 20 team. The match with Penn State
showed us where we are and how far
we have to go.”

Hnath’s teammate Kyle Nellis has
similar feelings about the team’s future
following the pain suffered from this
lopsided defeat to Penn State. “It’s
funny to say,” said Nellis, another
senior co-captain, “but it will help us.
The loss brings us closer together.”

However, it doesn’t get any easier
from here on in for the Panthers.
Tomorrow, the Pitt wrestlers must

again pack their gear and hit the
highway as they travel eastward to
Bloomsburg University. The Huskies
will greet Pitt with open arms and
hopes of taming the Panthers once
again in the comforts of their own
home, much the same as the Nittany
Lions did last Saturday.

The Panthers will be on the road
again as the travel date will mark the
sixth straight match they’ve had to
travel to. Pitt has not wrestled at home
since they downed Ashland College
25-17 back on Jan. 18 at Trees Hall.
One person who’s understandably con-
cerned is head coach Rande
Stottlemyer,

“I’m worried about the number of
times we’ve been going away,” said
Stottlemyer. “We’ve been traveling a

lot. and I can see it‘s starting to wear
on us. We’re beginning to feel it.”

Stottlemyer is also aware that it‘s not
getting any easier on his team. He
already has to deal with the tough task
of getting the team to rebound from
defeat and get back on, the same track.

“The guys know they have to take
something positive from last week and
continue working harder. It made us
realize that we have to work harder and
smarter. We haven’t given up, and it’s
certainly not the end of the world for
us,” said Stottlemyer.

“We have a really tough match
coming up, and our guys know they
can win if they wrestle like we were
earlier in the season,” Stottlemyer
continued.

It will be a challenge for the Panthers

and a true test of character and strength -1

to come back against Bloomsburg. The
Huskies are currently the ninth—ranked
team in the country. Their record is a
solid 10-4, but they have struggled in
the Eastern Wrestling League, posting
a disappointing 2-2 mark. Their EWL
record includes a 21-19 loss to the
WVU team that Pitt earlier defeated
25-13 in Morgantown.

Stottlemyer said that Pitt’s strengths
would meet Bloomsburg’s strengths,
making it a nip-and-tuck battle. Two

of the best Panther starters, Hnath and N

Nellis, will face the Bonomo twins,
Ricky and Rocky.

Ricky Bonomo is the defending Na-
tional Champion at 118 pounds and will
face Hnath at 126, bringing a 17-3
record into the match. Hnath will also
enter the match with a solid mark of
22-7. This will be a big test for Hnath,
who’s coming off an 11-0 shutout at the
hands of Penn State’s Tim Flynn.
Hnath knows better than anyone else
of the giant task before him.

“I have nothing to lose against him."
said a confident Hnath. “I’m trying not

to let the pressure get to me and not to .

let it effect my performance.

“As for the team. we definitely have
to win the close ones. We didn’t do that
at Penn State."

Another Panther on the hot seat is
Nellis. At 134 pounds, he will face the
other Bonomo twin. Rocky, 26-4 for
the year. will present Nellis with
another big challenge. He, too, is
coming off of a bittersweet defeat at
Penn State, where he was beaten 4-3
by Joe Hadge. whom Nellis had beaten
several times before. The ever-
optimistic Nellis isn’t worried and will
bring a 19-5 record into the match.

“I didn’t score when I had to at
critical times against Hadge." said
Nellis. “It’s almost easier against
someone tougher like Bonomo. I need
to go out and wrestle like I did in the
beginning of the season.

“I’m looking forward to wrestling
him. I have nowhere to go but up."
Nellis said.

The same can be said for the entire
Panther team. Pitt now heads down the
home stretch of the season. Following
tomorrow’s league battle, Pitt will next
host EWL rival Clarion University. the
nation’s third-ranked team, at Shaler
High School next Wednesday night at
8 p.m.

The EWL contest will be a very im-
portant dual meet for both teams. and
it will be an emotional event for two
participants. The match will mark the
homecoming of the Nellis brothers,
Kyle for Pitt and older brother Ken, a
starting 150-pounder and three—time
NCAA qualifier, for Clarion. The two
seniors will mark the end of their
wrestling careers at Shaler, where they
first made their names known.

Sports and Love  

Today is Valentine’s Day. Says so
right here on my calendar. I wanted to

_, write a column about Valentine’s Day

because that’s the kind of fella I am.
The problem is that the editors want me
to write about sports.

Well, maybe I’ll write about sports
and Valentine’s Day. There are con-
nections, you know. The Montreal
Expos used to have a player named
Ellis Valentine. In tennis, as the say-
ing on so many T-shirts reminds us,
love means nothing. The word zero is
substituted for by the word love. And
I hear Al Capone, who was behind the
Valentine’s Day Massacre, was a
baseball fan.

So now that I’ve clearly
demonstrated the strong link between
the athletic world and the world of
love, it is time to announce my first an-
nual Valentine’s Day—Sporting Life

Bob Travers

Awards.

The We-Miss-You-Kids-Being-
Together Award:This award goes to
Chris Evert and Jimmy Conners.
Remember the big romance those nuts
had going back at Wimbledon in the
1970s? Gosh, they were cute. Jimmy
and Chris were the funnest couple in
tennis, and the sport has lost tremen-
dously since they. parted. John
McEnroe and Tatum O’Neal just aren’t
as cuddly.

The Valentine’s Day Lifetime
Achievement Award for the Best
Trashsport of All Time:This award is
named for the day of romance because
Valentine’s Day falls in February. And
as everybody knows, February is the
worst month for sports. Look out there
— it is a vast, empty wasteland of

__nothingness. We don’t even have the

USFL to pull us through these four
long weeks anymore. Spring training
doesn’t start for another few weeks or
so, and hockey and basketball don’t get
interesting until March. Pro basketball,
infact, never gets interesting. So what
is there? Trashsports. Things like the
Superstars competition and the

Triathalon competion. We get surfers,
cyclists and roller derby on ESPN.
Maybe that’s why I don’t like February
at all. But the best trashsport of all time
was the ABC—TV show called “Almost
Anything Goes.” My God, that ‘was
entertainment! Fat ﬁremen and in-
surance salesmen from small towns
across America would try to beat teams
from other towns in the gooﬁest games
ever thought of. It was way better than
the runner-up “Battle of The Network
Stars.”

The Romeo and Juliet Award:This
award salutes the greatest couple of all
time by paying tribute to a match made
in heaven. The winning couple is the
Pittsburgh sports fans and Pittsburgh
sports teams, each complimenting the
other so nicely with assured incon-
sistency. The Steelers and Pitt’s basket-
ball team are the main reasons for the
ups and downs. Both teams showed
during the course of their respective
seasons that they were capable of
beating some of the best teams they
played. They also showed their inclina-
tions to lose to some of the worst. The
Pirates are the exception — they always
lost. The fans held up their end of the
bargain. After an opening night crowd
of over 50,000 last April, Pirate fans
stayed away from Bucco games in
record numbers. One would have
thought the players were on drugs or
something.

The Valentine’s Day Award for the
Biggest Heartbreakers of the Year:A
tie here between F oge Fazio and Gerry
Faust. Gee whiz, these two people
stood out like diamonds in a coalmine.
Everywhere you look these days all you
hear about is how screwed up
everything is that college athletics stood
for. Foge and Gerry always seemed to
keep some perspective on the game and
remembered that the game is played for
the players and students — not the
alumni booster club. I hope Notre
Dame plays Dayton in the Sugar Bowl
in a few years.

Sweetheart of the Year:T he nicest
guy in sports is the winner of this
award. The winner this year, in a
unanimous decision, Juaquin Andujar
of the St. Louis Cardinals. Andujar
epitomized what being a good sport is
all about in the World Series.

Pitt hosts track meet

By Roy Bigler
Staff Writer

This weekend will be a very busy
one for the members of Pitt’s track
team. The men will be attending three
different meets, and the women will be
hosting a meet. -

On Friday, Lee McRae will be at-
tending the Millrose Games in New
York City. Then on Sunday, McRae
and the two-mile relay team of Thomas
Boggan, Joe Daniels, Dave Moore and
Bob Weiner will be going to the Balley
Meet in Chicago. The rest of the men’s
team and the entire women’s team will
be staying here at Pitt to host the Pitt
Invitational on Saturday.

There will be 12 teams coming to the
Invitational; among them will be
Akron, California State, Edinboro,
Robert Morris and Virginia. Virginia
and Edin.boro represent the best their
respective conferences have to offer,

and will be stiff competition for the

athletes here at Pitt.

Neither the men nor the women are
placing much emphasis on this
weekend. McRae and the two-mile
relay team will be running to keep up
with the best that the nation has to of-
fer, but those who stay here at Pitt will
be appraoching the meet as a chance
to get some work done before heading
to the Big East Championship in
Syracuse next weekend.

According to the men’s head coach,
John Vasvary, he will be using this
weekend as a chance to relax his
athletes before the championship. “We
will not be putting much emphasis on
the meet, but will just be hoping that
we can keep from sustaining any more
injuries before next weekend."
Vasvary said. A

He is hoping that being on their hom
track will help his athletes to relax with
the conference championship so close.

“In getting ready for the champion-
ship, this will give us a chance to com-
pete, and be at home,” he said.
The women’s head coach, Steve
Lewis, is using this meet as more than
just a chance to compete at home, but
at the same time, he is in the process
of making last-minute preparations for
the upcoming championship. “As far
as this weekend is concerned, we are
not appraoching it as a championship
meet,” Lewis stated. “We are going

_to get some wo_rk done in the area that

need work done, rest some of our peo-
ple from their events, and make some
last-minute decisions before the cham-
pionship. ”

Pittsburgh —- University of Pitt-
sburgh football coach Mike Gott-
fried completed his staff today by
hiring Chuck Klausing as assistant
head coach. Klausing has been a
highly successful head coach the
past 10 years at neighboring
Carnegie-Mellon University.

Klausing, 60, grew up in
Wilmerding and resides in Penn
Hills. He was a head coach at IUP,
an assistant head coach at West
Virginia University and an assitant
coach at Rutgers and Army. He

gained nationwide attention as a ,

high school coach at Pitcairn and
Braddock at the beginning of his
career.

His record at CMU was 77—15—2
with an .829 winning percentage.
He is believed to be the second best
among active coaches on the
NCAA Division III level. His Tar-
tans won the championship of the
President’s Conference six times,
and he was named the Conference
Coach of the Year the same number

of times. Last year’s team finished
8-1, ranked sixth in the nation, and
the Tartans went to the playoffs for
the fourth time in Klausing’s
coaching reign.

He graduated from Slippery
Rock University in 1948, and has
a master’s degree in education from
the University of Pittsburgh.

Gottfried feels he has strengthen-
ed his staff with his ﬁnal ‘hiring,
coming just a day after Pitt signed

19 prospects on national letter of in-

tent signing day.

“I’m very happy to have him,”
said Gottfried. “He is an outstan-
ding addition to our staff. He will
be the assistant head coach and will
help coach our defense. He is a man
of great integrity with a terrific
reputation among coaches. He is a
great football coach and
disciplinarian. He has strong ties in
the area, and is respected in the
community. I’m real happy with the
staff we have put together.”

Klausing is equally pleased with
the turn of events. “It’s still

coaching, and I love to coach in my
hometown,” commented Klaus-
ing. “I’m looking forward to help-
ing Mike be the winner everyone
in Pittsburgh wants him to be. I’ve
been a Pittsburgher all my life. I’m
looking forward to coaching at one
of my alma maters."

Klausing told his CMU players
of his decision today. One of his
former assistants, Rich Lackner,
who has been with him since 1979,
succeeds him as the CMU head
coach.

The rest of Coach Gottfried’s A

staff is as follows: Mike Solari (of-
fensive coordinator, offensive line);
John Fox (defensive coordinator,
defensive backs); Mike Dickens
(quarterbacks); Tommie Liggins
(running backs); Sal Sunsei
(linebackers); Steve Coury
(recievers); Carl Angelo (defensiv
line). \
Sharing the duties as ad-
ministrative coordinators are Alex
Kramer and Dave Didion. Bud
Ratliff is the recruiting coordinator.

This being Valentine's Day, I’d like
to talk about one of the great loves of
my life: baseball. Speciﬁcally. I’d like
to talk about “the ol’ ballpark.”

I especially love the older parks.
Most of the recently built stadiums are
too “adaptable.” Any sport can be

A played in them. I like stadiums that

 

werejbuilt with baseball in mind. If
people want to play another sport in
there, they should have to adjust to the
baseball set-up.

I especially like the older parks
because they were usually built with
larger playing surfaces. I’ve always
preferred speed to power. Where has
the inside-the-park home run gone?
The most thrilling play in all of sports
has sadly dwindled into the back-
ground. Let’s bring it back! I only hope
that, when the “soon-to-be” an-
nounced expansion franchises are
awarded, the owners are the nostalgic
type and will build old-fashioned
ballparks. They probably would end up
as minor tourist attractions.

The stadium that I would have loved
to have spent an entire season in was

the legendary Polo Grounds, home of
the New York Giants. It was shaped
like a pentagon. Try these fence
distances on for size: Left ﬁeld — 279
feet; right ﬁeld — 257 feet; center ﬁeld
— 483 feet! The power alleys were
well over 400 feet as well. This park
was the site of many inside-the-park
home runs. Even a 34-year-old Casey
Stengel managed to hit one. How do
you defend such a massive area? The
Giants ﬁnally ﬁgured it out when they
stuck a kid named Willie Mays out
there. Can you imagine an entire
season of watching Mays out there in
that wide open area? Talk about win-
ning the lottery!

Back to the present, I’d like to visit
all of the stadiums in the major leagues.
Then again, I’d like to visit all of the
minor league parks, too. Something
tells me that they would have a scaled-
down version of that old-fashioned
look.

But for right now, here’s a list of my
10 most-desired major league parks to
visit (in reverse order).

10. Riverfront Stadium —— Yeah, I
know, everyone who knows me is
thinking, “What, only tenth? Pete Rose
plays there!” I can see Pete play in a
lot of other parks, too. But on the other
hand, that is the only reason that River-
front made my top 10 list. I’d like to
hear Pete get the ovation that he
deserves. I could applaud him without
having to look Over my shoulder.

9. Country Stadium — It’s a fairly
old ballpark, but I like it because of a

- recent addition. Whenever a Brewer

hits a home run, or whenever there is
a Brewer victory, this guy named Ber-

. nie Brewer slides down a chute into a

8. Royals Stadium — This would
have to be a night game. The water
spectacular in the outﬁeld is even more

A breathtaking when illuminated at night.
Taking it in between innings would be
well worth the price of admission.

7. Dodger Stadium —— I’d like my
game here to be a Saturday afternoon
game against the Reds. This stadium

has been called the cleanest and best-
kept stadium in baseball by many
who’ve seen them all. Also, it has been
the site of a great baseball tradition.

6. Cleveland Municipal Stadium —
The Indians played their first game here
54 years ago. That alone should tell you
why I’d like to visit. In fact, consider-
ing the Indians’ recent “success” (ha-
ha), that should tell you why anyone
has bothered to visit. It’s too bad that
they didn’t leave the fence in its
original position. It was 320 feet down
both lines, but was shaped similar to
the Polo Grounds, as the power alleys
were 463 feet and the center ﬁeld wall
stood 470 feet from home plate.

5. Yankee Stadium — This 63-year-
-old beauty speaks for itself in its name.
Ruth. Gehrig. Mantle. Stengel.
DiMaggio. Ford. Lazzeri. Dickey.
Berra. It has been the site of 91 World
Series games. I’d have to go to at least
two games here. I’d miss the first one
just by daydreaming. There is an unex-
plainable majesty about this structure.

4. Wrigley Field — How about a
Sunday afternoon doubleheader against
the Reds, with the wind blowing out.
I hope that the Cubs ‘stay here forever
and that lights are never installed. It
turns 70 this season. A A

’ 3. Fenway Park —— The 37-foot
Green Monster has stood for 74 years.
I dream about being invited to_ go out
during batting practice, and being
allowed to play a few ﬂy balls off of

the Green Monster. When I return to"

the stands, I’d like to be seated in the
first row of the center ﬁeld bleachers,
right next to the Monster.

2. Tiger Stadium — I ﬁnally made
it to Tiger Stadium last summer. They
were playing the Yankees and I
watched Billy Martin fielding
grounders at second base during bat-
ting practice. Hey, that’s my kind of

' manager! He can’t get enough. I could

never get enough of Tiger Stadium. It’s
beautiful. One look inside tells you that
it was born around the turn of the cen-
tury. It  did I say born? Well, I’ve

always thought of an old ballpark as be-
ing part human, and the tearing of one
down is equal to murder. Tiger

ll of ballparks from coast-to-coast

Stadium had better stand forever. This
park is a dream to baseball purists. It
has grass, a deep center ﬁeld and those
columns reaching from the seats, up to
the roof. They mayget in the way, but
they give the place that nostalgic look
of the 1920s. I wish more ballparks had
that look.

1. Comisky Park -— This, the oldest
park in the big leagues, was born in
1910. I’d love to spend a week here.
In fact. I wouldn’t even want to leave
at night. I’d like to sleep in the dugout.
How much more needs to be said for
a ballpark with an exploding
scoreboard to celebrate round-trippers.
I’d like to be there for a night game
when two of the White Sox players hit
back-to-back home runs. This, and
many other fan delights, were the
genius of Bill Veeck.

Baseball will miss Bill Veeck. He
knew what baseball was meant to be:
Fun, at its highest level. It is, in my
opinion, the single greatest form of
entertainment in the world, when
presented in Veeck fashion.

You probably noticed that Three
Rivers Stadium didn’t make my list.‘Its
only good feature is the giant screen in
centerfield. But even that is used to
about 50 percent of its potential.

Every time that I see" a picture of
Forbes Field, I feel like crying. This

‘ '1  Brueckner

-‘£5.

was a Classic ballpark. Why did we

haveto lose it‘?

Why did we have to lose those other
crazy, but lovable ballparks?

How about BroOklyn’s Ebbets Field,
and its right ﬁeld wall that wasn’t ﬂat?
The side of the wall facing the ﬁeld was
dented .in the middle, giving the ap-
pearance of half of an elongated
diamond. The fans thrilled to the many
bounces that balls took off that wall.

What about Cleveland's League
Park, with its own version of “the

Green Monster”? The 40-foot high”

right ﬁeld wall stood just 297 feet from
home plate. Philadelphia's Shibe Park

also had a similar right ﬁeld wall once.
But my all—time favorite is still the
Polo Grounds. It has the_best of both
worlds. Owners today keep moving in

the fences to increase home runs
(crowd favorites). Well, the Polo
Grounds had extremely short distances
down the lines, but it also had the deep
centerfield for the even more exciting
triples and inside-the-park home runs.
I wonder if any future owners have

ever considered this? Or if any current 1.

owners are looking for ways to attract
more fans? Believe me, a lot of fans
enjoy the inside-the-park homer just as
much, maybe even more, than the
over—the—fence homer.

Spring training is only days away.

A  ("aid for by ,iyour"studentlactivities.fee)

By Gary Geller
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
women’s swim team is conﬁdent about
the chance of winning the Big East
Championships for the fourth con-
secutive year. Pitt has compiled a 1 1-0
dual-meet victory total and has
dominated all of their opponents. Fur-
thermore, the Panthers have cruised
through 20 straight victories since last

‘year.

“I don’t think we’ll have too_much
trouble capturing the Big East Cham-
pionships,” said junior swimmer Tracy
Pfister. “We’ve already beaten all of
the other contenders.

“After the first day, it’s not likely
that anyone will be able to catch us,“
claimed Pﬁster.

This competition will match quality
swimmers against each other from
among the different squads. Pitt,
though, is really competing against
themselves in an “ideal competition. ”

“We’ll just have to race our op-
ponents. In the Big East Champion-
ships, we’ll pretend that our teammates
are the opponents,” said sophomore
Cindy Rose.

“I’d like to see everybody perform
within themselves and their own poten-
tial, ” commented coach David

Belowich. “We’d like to cap off the
year in a way that really reflects what
the whole team is about and use that
as a steppingstone going into nationals.
“Every team has a number of good
individuals who will present good
challenges for us,” explained
Belowich. “The Big East swimming is
getting progressively bigger.”

A key for the Panthers’_ success _has
been the intensity and character of the
squad. A telling reflection of the team’s
character is evident in the team meeting
that was purposely held without

Belowich so the squad could propose
their own goals.

Cindy Rose, a member of Pitt’s
200-yard freestyle relay team said.
“We met as a team and decided to set
some team goals. We want to break
1,000 points by Saturday night. Last
year, we were in the 900s.”

Belowich was proudof his squad for
taking the initiative and asserting
themselves for championship competi-
tion. “They deﬁned what they wanted
to do as a group and came up with ex-
cellent goals, both from a team and per-
sonal concept.”

The consensus that resulted from the
team meeting was for Pitt’ to swim as
a team and to give a 100 percent effort
so that they could go after some record
swim times.

“We must find motivation among
ourselves,” said Pfister. “We have
high expectations of doing our best
times and of qualifying for nationals.”

Rose echoed her teammate by say-
ing, “We really want to get together
and have team support. We’re like best
friends. You know that they’ll be
behind ‘you all the way.”

Among personal goals, both swim-
mers wanted to win the 200- and
400-yard freestyle relay. The team, ac-
cording to Pﬁster. was “close to quali-
fying for Division I Nationals.”

In addition, Rose said, “I think our
times are faster this year than last year.
We’re competing better this year.”

“One goal is to help the team qualify
for Nationals. We want to have our
seasonal best times, if not, then our
personal best times. I want it to be the
best meet of the year for myself,” said
Pfister.

These team-oriented attitudes have
been "the trademark of the winning
tradition in Pitt swimming fortunes.
The team competes together and also
celebrates victories together.

“Since the very ﬁrst meet of the
year, everyone has performed out-

standingly,” said Pﬁster. “People have -

come through whether we need a ﬁrst-
or, even a third-place ﬁnish. I think it’s

:.really help us to!-be undefeated.”
