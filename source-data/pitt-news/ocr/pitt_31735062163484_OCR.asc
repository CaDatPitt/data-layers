Students Want Improvement

SG Announces

LA Cabinet

Plans For Evaluation Examines Courses

By PAT POLLINO
After much deliberation, Student Govern-
ment passed a motion calling for a committee
to be formed to investigate the possibility ‘of

_i starting a student evaluation of all under-
graduate courses at the University, and to In-

vestigate the methods that would be used for.
suichian ev_aluation. , A

The original motion was introduced by Ben _
Cardin; It was amended to_include the phrase‘
“in conjunction with IFC (Interfraternity
Council.” '. ’ ,

Martin Landy, president? of SG,_ explained-
that the group would work together with IFC,
originator of the student evaluation project,
and other interested organizationse

Independent Committee
= Cardin explained that the resolution as
passed is just to investigate the possibility of
starting a student evaluation, and the SG com-
mittee "formed would be independent of any
other similar _group, including the Liberal Arts
Cabinet, which is investigating 80s courses.-
. _“N_o faculty or administration representa-
tives- would be involved on the committee,"
Cardin noted. ‘ ~. -

Warren Cohn, representing the LA Cabinet,
told 'SG members that the Cabinet “would _like
to see Student Government investigate this
but 'we’ll not take it on our
shoulders.”

. Very Complicafted

Cardin explained that such an investigation
would. be very complicated —- that it would in- .
volvethe book, the professor and the course.

“It might end— up costing‘ money,” he
warned. \ * ' _

'Landy‘t_ermed the idea “something that has
to be done very carefully and very well.”

He" admonished the group to guard
against any. bias which might blot such’ a‘
venture. ’ _

Committee members will be named at a
future SG meeting, according to La'ndy.'

 

By MARCIA BERNSTEIN _

Student ,Government’s proposal to investi-
gate the feasibility of _publishing a booklet
evaluating‘ University courses (see ‘adjacent
story) prompted approval and criticism- from
two other student groups.

These groups are organizations already in-
volved in a job of this type; Interfratejnity
Council, which has recently adopted a ‘similar
proposal, and the Liberal Arts Cabinet, an or-
ganization set up to deal with. any problems in.
the ﬁeld of Liberal Arts. Dr. Albert B. Martin,

"Dean of Liberal Arts, is also closely involved _

in any project of this nature. V
When presented with Ben Cardin’s pro-

— posal, Dr. Martin replied, “I’m not‘ opposed to

this demonstration of student interest in what -‘ '.
kind of education they're getting. I think,
though, that they ought to ‘be aware that ‘this

_has to be a responsible job. They can’t be

—

trapped into dealing with personalities.
V Legitimate Function L

“Breadth is ‘necessary if the students are to
do justice to the general program of education.
I feel that this is‘a -legitimate function of’Stu—
dent.GovernIn_ent. If it isbeing done on an in-
stitutional‘-\ basis I have no objection,” Dr.
Martin explained. ‘ -

The LA Cabinet, however took a more
pessimistic attitude toward the proposal.
Generally, the Cabinet is not delighted, with
.the idea, but is cxpectantly waiting what
may develop from an investigation, accord-
ing to~Martha Holstein, speaking, for the’
group. ’ I

i “We are anticipatinga thorough investiga-

‘ tion. The Cabinet is convinced that the idea

has potential, but the date for its fullﬁllment
seems to be far in the future as we found from
one semester of workin one small ﬁeld of this
area,” Miss, Holstein explained.

  Corps Head Visits City   
To Recruit Volunteers    

Peace Corps Director, Sargent Shriver, .will address as
Mid-day Series ' audience tomorrow in conjunction with.‘

Mayor -Barr’s proclamation of Peace Corps Week in Pitts-_,
burgh which extends today through Saturday.

, Shriver will be in Pittsburgh from Monday evening‘ I
through Tuesday afternoon, visiting "Duquesne University”

and Mayor Barr, and taping radio
and television shows. A specia
Peace Corps team from Washing-
ton will be recruiting volunteers

throughout‘ the city all week long.

According ‘to George Nicolau, 
co-ordinator of the Pittsburgh 
. program, “Our major effort will‘
, be to informpotential volunteers 
about the‘ critical need for their ;
skills in developing nations around 
.3 the world. The Peace‘ Corps is:
planning the largest spring train- '

ing program in the agency’s his-
tory._V Some 1,000 volunteers will
enter training in February and
March“ for service in 18 different
countries.” ‘

This is in addition to the more '

than 7,000; volunteers, including
26 from Pittsburgh 'and 13 Uni-
versity alumni, now working in
46 countries. ‘ - -
PeaceCorps information cen-
ters will be located in the Stu-
dent Union, Duquesne Univer-
sity, Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology, One -Gateway Center,
and Kaufmann’s downtown. The
booths will be‘ manned by re-
turn volunteers and members
of the Washington staff.“ ,
The results, which will be re-
vealed to the student within 7 a
month, determine the student’s
overall ‘ability and the areas in
which his talents can ,best be

’ utilized. A questionnaire to de-

termine an applicant’s education,
background, and six references
must be ﬁlled out.

Any American citizen over 18

is eligible to take the test. Ac-

cording to Nicolau, teachers‘ are
most in demand, but there is a
need for construction workers,

mechanics, engineers, shop work-
ers, nurses and carpenters.

For Research

Drs. Bernard and Edwin R.
Fisher, professsors of surgery and
pathology respectively in the Uni-
versity Medical School, have re-
ceived a four year research grant
totaling approximately $80,560.

They will use the grant to con-

‘tinue their studies in homotrans-

plantation, the transplanting of
organs from one host to a dif-
ferent individaul. ‘

. “We have been working on the
project for six years,” explained
Dr. Bernard Fisher. “There is

some basic information why the

transplantation between tissues of
non-identical structure doesn’t
work.”

fresh breeze to the campus in his

of the audience the breeze might

“If you despair of life," advised
White, “retreat from it. Take to

Dr. Harry I Mooney, assistant"
professor of English, will review’

Vincent Sheean’s Dorothy and Red‘
at the Book Center Wednesday at
'4 pm.

The book is an account of Doro-
thy Thompson, a noted foreign

correspondent, and her marriage 7

to Sinclair Lewis: Sheean has
based his acount on Miss "Thomp-
son's diaries, letters, and papers

which are now on ﬁle at Syra-

cuse University. _
Telling’ of the days of “blackest
pain” and “intense p1easure”,that

.Miss Thompson and Lewis spent

together, Sheean’s book contains’
whole sections of extensive quotes
taken from Miss Thompson’;
papers. V

The documentary material
from the diary and ‘ letters is

tied together by the author’s_

own narrative which is based
upon his long, close friendship
with both the husband and the
wife. Sheean reveals that the‘
‘seeds of disaster showed up in
the very beginning of their
marriage, although outside ap-
pearances gave an entirely dif-

ferent impression. » J \

Sheean ‘has been a writer‘ and

F irst Interfaith
Collegiate Meeting
At .Washington

A Student Conference on
Race and‘Religion, the first
interfaith meeting on a col-
lege student level, is being
held in Washington DC.,
Sunday through Wednesday.

The meeting concerns the general
area of civil rights and interra-
cialvpolicieslin the college and the
community.

Students from the University
have joined 240 others from 75

campuses. These’ students repre-_

‘sent the four‘ sponsering organi-
zations: B’nai B’rith Hillel Foun-

dations, National Newman _ Club
Federation, National Federation of
Catholic College Students, and the
National Student Christian Fed-
eration.

, The core of the’ program con-

_ cerns seminars and workshops to
traincollege students for action,

on their respective campuses.
Seminars are on four topics: non-
violence as a philosophy and
strategy, discrimination and seg-
regation ln public facilities and
housing, politics and power struc-
ture, and -discrimination in edu-
cation.

Workshops are on such sub-
_jects as tutorial and interracial
social service _programs, stu-
dents and political action and
student action and academic
.freedom. ’

‘A In addition to the core program
representatives at the meeting Wlll

‘be able to express their opinions

on racial problems to Senators,
Congresmen, and other Adminis-
tration mofﬁcials.

The’ generation and Exchange
of ideas at. the Conference will
hopefully beneﬁt three." student
programs. These are the Hill Ed-
ucation program, a tutorial pI‘0i-
ect for children in the Hill dis-
trict, the local chapter of ,the
NAACP, and a new organization
-the Pittsburgh Volu:.teers.

"However, the chief goal of the
program of the University level is
a broader philosophical commit-
ment across all religious lines ac-
cording to Mrs. Edward Pinneo,
Director of Educational Resources.

One of the leading teams in upper atmosphere
‘research and plasma physics is now at the Uni-
versity’s Space Research Coordination Center.
The appointment of Dr. Wade Lanford Fite,
:Dr. Edward Gerjuoy, and R. T. Brackman were‘
:announced by Chancellor Litchfield Thursday. All
Ithree will hold positions in the physics department.
: Ma/ny atmospheric problems should be solved
:by their research, according to Litchﬁeld. “The
:research conducted by this team, promises to an-
Oswer some of the fundamental mysteries in the
:outer shell of the earth’s atmosphere,” he said.
The three men will conduct research into
the properties of electrically charged gases and
the collisions of atoms, ions, and molecules in
the upper atmosphere. These studies could im--
prove radio transmission, and rocket propulsion.
Studies of the collision processes of elements

,Views on Diet Problem

By PAT POLLINO

Dietary problems in the Uni-
versity’s cafeteria involve a dis-
tinct minority, according to Wil-
liam Crafts, dean of men, and
“we feel they (the students) can
adjust to the situation.” -

Craft’s comment followed‘ a state-
ment made by Dean Helen Poole
Rush, dean of students andedean
of women, that the problems are
“very minor” and
come to my attention only in-
directly.”

The Pitt News asked Crafts;
Charles Douglass, director of
Saga Food Service; and Rabbi
Richard ' Rubinstein, University
chaplain for Jewish students, for
their views on the dietary prob-
lems. 1

Lunch Ticket Query

The ‘News’ also asked about-
the possibility of students being
able‘ to purchase a two—meal
lunch ticket for the fall and win-

- ter terms. Under the present set-

up, students may purchase a two-
meal lunch ticket only in the
spring. ‘
Crafts pointed out that a stu-
dent asked him earlier in the
term if it were possible to break
the mandatory rule charging all
dormitory residents the cost of
a meal ticket. The student ex-
plained he wished to eat kosher
food and that the Towers _cafe-
teria did not offer kosher food.
“We are somewhat concerned
and will continue to study "the
matter,” said Dean Crafts.

Only Go So Far

But he added that the program '

can only goso far in satisfying
everyone. According to Dean
Crafts, the problem isgbeyond the
scope of any one
office, and until the "University

decides to change its policy, no,

exceptions will be made to un-
dergraduates on "purchasing meal
tickets. I
’ Douglass declared that the
food service is not -set up to
prepare as kosher diet. He stated
that the food service ‘attempts’
, to prepare menus to ‘please the
majority,

“A breakdown of students eat-
ing in the cafeteria,” Douglass
said, “reveals 101 different cul-
tural groups with a number of
likes and wants.” ' '

rConﬁrms Set-up

As for the matter of two-meal
lunch tickets, Douglass conﬁrmed
that a breakfast-dinner meal (14
meals) ticket had been offered last
summeriand the ‘summer before.
However, he explained that for

Ragtime and Rootbeer

 

 

 

PM Guest Revives “the Rag ”.

By LARRY BERNFEL‘Dl

Max Morath is a great per-
former. Some men can play the

piano. Others can sing and tell
funny s_tories. “Ragtime” ,Max
Morath combines all three with
such- skill that he held the PM
series audience captive without
telling one dirty joke. ~ -

Appearingin ablue pinstriped
suit and vest, ‘high_ white collar
grey’ bowler, Spats, a white car-

 

nation, and a wide smile, Morath

opened the PM program with, a
history of the “ragtime” era in
words and music. In a brash,
powerful circus barker’s voice,
Morath related ragtime music to
the ‘turn of the century, and the
early movie houses the
nickleodeons. '
Morath used the “Magic Lan-
tern” to show a series of early
nickelodeon slides. He accom-
panied the slides with song and
the piano, in addition to leading,
an audience sing—a-song to “By
the Light of the Silvery Moon.”

Leaving the movie house and 

getting down to very basic rag-
time, he played Scott Joplin’si
“Maple Rag,” the number that
started the ragtime revolution in
1899. Morath showed a strong
ragtime piano technique. A clean
jump base, thesolid rythm was in
trueeom-pah style. He made good
use of .shading and simulated a
piano player./effect in the right
hand that was pleasing and
should*have been used_more often.

After a short intermission, Mo-
rath appeared in a new costume.
He played a request of “Take Me
Out to the Ballgame,” singing the
words exactly one beat late —- an

Continuing to vary his perform-

ance, .Morath sang a World War

—  A In last Friday issue of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, there appeared an article

‘ concerning the recently announced increases in tuition at Carnegie Tech, Chatham

.-College, Duquesne University, and Mount Mercy College.

[ A Mentioning the rising costs of college maintenance, the article went on to specu-
late on the situationgexisting here at the University. Both Chatham and Carnegie

...Tech now have tuitions in the 1,600 dollar bracket while Pittsburgh’s still remains at
approximately 1,200 dollars. _

4 Since Chancellor Litchﬁeld took over at the University, the article continued,

tuition has increased on the average of once every two years. It was two years ago

next’ month that the last tuition raise was announced at this institution.

 At last Monday’s_Administrative Coffee Hour, Miss Helen Poole "Rush, dean of
‘studeiﬁs, was asked whether she could forsee any. increase of tuition in the near
future. Notjonly didn’t Miss Rush deny -plans for an increase, but she took a few
minutesto try and explain how rising costs might necessitate such a move.

After the Coffee Hour was over, we approached  Alan C. Rankin, assistant

‘chancellor for student and general affairs, and asked him if anincrease was imminent.
He admitted that the subject was being discussed and that he would let The Pitt News
know as soon as anything deﬁnite had becided upon. _

, The picture is now pretty clear. Basing our evalutions upon these statements

‘and the general college situation, we believe that an increase in tuitioh-of at least
one hundred dollars per term will be announced“ by the Universitylin the very.near

Student Government’s recent decision to investigate the working of The Pitt

jwhen it set up its ﬁve man committee. 0 .
' For the ﬁrst time, The Pitt News will be "face to, face with, one of SG’s rnany
committees. Because the committee is investigating a group with which we are well
acquainted, we will be in an excellent position to judge whether SG committees‘ are
responsible organizations or whether their reports are shallow and without substance.

We will have the opportunity to see SG as a working concern‘ ﬁrsthand, and
will ﬁnally discover if SG can understand the difference between truth. and lie, be-
"tween prejudice and criticism, and between investigation and defamation. For this
opportunity, we are indebted to SG. , '

Patches 2  
A a " By-Mar_vin Zelkowiiz

I’ve heard ofeplannendkobsolescence but this business ,

‘of pre-patched clothing is getting a little out of hand. '

Last week I walked into a men’s clothing store‘ to
buy a sport coat. , . ’
'. Ajyoung continentally clad gentleman approached .
me. “Can I help you sir?” he said.  ‘

“Yes,” I_answered. “I want ‘to buy :
a sport coat.”

“What color?’’. ~ '

“Oh something dark ‘. . . preferably _
-in a green or/brown.”

“Very well, sir. Right this way.”

I needed a new spo_rt_coat because
the one I had was worn at the‘ elbows.

As I walked to the coat rack I .. g _ . . . 
couldn’t help but noticing a ‘fellow student leaning
againsthis elbows one the brick wall of the-building. He
kept rubbing his elbows against the wall. . -

“Try this one on, sir” \ _ .

The sport coat, the clerk showed me was a green
corduroy. As I tried it on, I noticed it had patches on the

  
 
    

. sleeves.

s “The "sport coat I’m wearning‘ novsi needs patches

I “on its sleeves,” I thought. “This one must be a used
sport coat.”

“Sir. I’d like to see a new jacket.” I said." “This one
is used See? It even has patches on it.” -’

“But that’s the latest style sir,”' he said. “This year
patches are the trend. We have patched sweaters, patch- , .
ed shirts, ‘and patched jackets. We even have some
patched coats if you like to see them.” '

“Don’t you have any without patches?”

_“I’mso_rry, sir, but they?re out of style.”

“Well,” I sighed, “I guess I*ll' take the corduroy‘ '

coat. then.’.-’ .  ‘ .

As’ I walked out of the store I saw the same boy

leaning ‘against the wall. He, kept rubbing his sleeves
’ against the brick. ; '

“What are you doing?”f‘I._asked. _
“,’m' trying to wear out thesleeves of "my shirt,”

‘ ~ he ‘said.

‘ ¢4Why?9s I , ‘

“Because if I wear out my sleeves, I can put patches
on it; You can’t be invogue now without patchesyou
know.” , _ -_ _ . V

“Yes, I know,” I said, remembering my experience
in the men’s store. _ . . 1 , ‘

As, I_ left the student, visions of_nex.t year’s fashions
danced in my head. First, there would probably be
pre-let. down cuffs ‘on cuffed. pants. There -would be
shirts wit_h__pre-turned collars and already frayed cuﬁs.

T_hen'we. would have pre—resoled shoes, gloves with
p're-cracked‘ ‘leather. There would be loafers with the

“That team is quite a lot,” Dietzel
said, “They just whipped us‘ on the
line. They were too strong.” ‘

The ferocity of the Panther line
had Dietzel somewhat dazed. Even
Panther coaches John Michelosen and
Ernie Heﬁerle were a bit surprised by
the showing against Army.

Michelosen said, “We didn’t know

we had to learn to work against all of them. But things
worked out real well.’’ , .

They certainly did. The offensive performance put on
by Martha, Leeson and the rest of the Panther backs could
not have been accomplished without the superb line play that
was displayed Saturday. They ruined Army’s key defensive
weapon. .

. “We pride ourselves on our pursuit,” Dietzel sa:id. “We
just couldn’t pursue out there today.” '
. Calls Martha The Best ,

Dietzel didn’t restrict his praise to the Panther line, ‘how-
even. He called Martha “the best halfback that has lined up
against us this year.” He also repeated a statement he made
earlier in the week that “Martha will be the ﬁrst college
player picked by the pros.”

Army also had its own troubles in addition to the ones
the. Panthers were giving them. According to Dietzel the
Cadets’ star ha1fback’Ken Waldrop had a broken thumb. “He
couldn’t grip the ball well,” said Dietzel. “It’s a real credit
to Ken’s ability that he was able to play as well as he did
today. I think he played a ﬁne game.

“But I shouldn’t be making excuses,” Dietzel said, “Pitt

Backfield Romps For 359 Yards
As Gridders Crush Cadets, 23-0  

By AL BLUMKIN

Fred‘ Mazurek and "Rick Leeson helped, too.

Coach John Michelosen leaned’ back in ‘his
office chair with a big smilevon his face Satur-
day. He had just seen the Panthers overwhelm
Army, 28-0, and raise their record to 7-1. “It

' was the best 60 minutes we played all year. The

boys were tremendous in the last half. of the
Syracuse game, but this was the best,” he said.

Army came into
Pittsburgh with the
third best (1 e f_e n s e

nation. This record
was partially made
against such weaklings
as Wake Forest, Bos-
ton U., Cincinnati and
Utah. T
It didn’t take the

On the Panthers’ second seriesof downs in the
ﬁrst quarter, they drove 80 yards in four plays
to score. This drive was the beginning of an
afternoon where the Panthers picked up 359
yards on the ground and‘ sent the Cadets home
talking to themselves.
‘ . A Makes Prediction Good
During the week, Army Coach Paul Dietzel
said, “Paul Martha is possibly/the best college
player in the country.” Martha did his best to
live up to the prediction. The ﬂeet halfback car-
ried the ball 6 times for 103 yards, including a
48-yard -gallop for the ﬁrst Panther touchdown.

    

against rushing in the .

Mazurek picked up 105 yards rushing and pass-
ing,‘ running his tdtal offense to 1134 yards for
the season. The schoolrecord is 1338 set by
Warren Heller  I931. Leeson, the. powerful
fullback, rushed” for 77 yards and picked up

several vital ﬁrst downs. “The Pitt backfield is

great,” said Dietzel. “It’s impossible to ‘key on
any one of them.” '
i ‘ , Won on Line‘ ,

Both coaches agreed, however, that the game
was won in the line. “They whipped _us in the
middle,” said Dietzel. The Panther line played a

V great game. Jeff Ware and Al Grigaliunas threw

crunching blocks which shook ,Martha loose for
the ﬁrst Pantherd touchdown, and Ray Popp
sprung John Telesky for a 24-yard romp which
set up thelast score. _

Better Than Showed

The Cadets never really were in the game.
“We’re better than we showed,” said Dietzel.
“Pitt just outplayed us.” He felt the turning
point, “if any,” was the second touchdown,
scored by Fred Mazurek- on a quarterback keep
of 33 yards. “It was the same play he scored on
against Syracuse,” ‘said Michelosen.

One of the more‘ humorous aspects of the
game occurred in the ﬁrst quarter, when Michel-.
osen tried to send. in the second team after Army
missed a ﬁeld goal try. The coach was a‘ little
confused by the substitution rule, which reads
like the_Koran. The oiﬁcials would not permit
the wholesale changes. Forced to stay in the
game, the ﬁrst unit drove for a touchdown.

Panthers Could Advance   Grid Ratings

Every team in the United

football ratings won last week,
but the chances of the Pan-
ther gridders moving up from
their. ﬁfth, position of last

week ‘appear to b‘e_good.

The Panthers look like a good
bet to move ahead of fourth-rank.-i
ed Michigan State, who squeezed
by Notre Dame, 12-7. Coach
Johnny Michelosen’s team whip-
ped the Irish,’27-7, the week be-
fore they met Michigan State.

On the basis of the Panthers’
impressive '28-0_ drubbing over
twelfth-ranked Army, and the
ease with which they handled
Notre Dame as compared to

Miichigan State,  "seems 

 

UPI’s 35 man board of coaches‘
will move the Panthers up.
Chances of advancing higher
than fourth‘ are-not as good. Top-
ranked Texas maintained its per-

fect record by whipping Texas

third-ranked Mississippi shut-out

He called Pittsburgh's Mellon
