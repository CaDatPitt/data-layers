Freshmen Taste   College

Band, Block Shine;

Yell Session Fizzles

A pre-game yell session, sponsored by Student Congress and
the Pitt cheerleaders, fizzled out before it was even started.
The rally was slated for 1:30 p.m. at the stadium. Purpose of
thewirally was to lead the freshmen in their firstreal try at Pitt
cheers, and to give the upperclassmen a much needed practice
session. In both respects the rally failed, but the Pitts went on

to beat William and Mary 13-7.

vs

Cheering during the games was sometimes enthusiastic, and
sometimes lackadasical. Much of the cheering had an alcoholic

tinge to it.

Noticeable at the game were the
freshmen resplendent in their gold
and blue dinks. This was a sight
which hasn’t been seen at Pitt for
a long time.

The Pitt marching band put on
their usual sparkling performance
with the marching as precise and
fast as ever.

Adding color to the game was
the first appearance of the reorgan-
ized Pitt demonstration block. The
block was enthusiastic, and al-
though some of the formations were
ragged, they made a commendable
showing. With a little practice the
demonstration block should be. a
standout at future games. i

The highlight of the block

demonstration was unplanned and
entirely spontaneous. When the
block director called for the blue
and gold capes, everyone began
throwing them towards the band-
stand. The resulting cascade of
blue and gold outshone the rest of
the formations. . *
0 At the end of the game a rush
of students, high school that is,
charged the goal postsand obliter-
ated them with neatness and dis-
patch. The law stood idly by and
watched. .

Enrollment

0 Shows Drop

Although enrollment figures have
not been completely tallied, Pitt's
enrollment seems to be headed for
a drop.

Last year's total registration
W35 20.420. This year's will prob-
ably hit the 19,000 mark.

New freshmen numbered approxi-
mately 200 women and 850 men.
Most of the latter will make their
headquarters at Ellsworth Center.

Actual registration time this
year took little over an hour as a
result of a new system that enabled
students to fill out the majority of

‘ their cards at home.

Pitt In Fix

Street repairs about Pitt have
almost isolatedthe Cathedral from
the rest of Oakland.

At large diesel shovel is ripping
up Forbes Street faster than an
aggravated earthworm. Purpose of
this wholesale destruction is to
-widen and repair Forbes Street up
to Craig Street.

Both sides of the street will be
repaired, so students will literally
.get it coming and ‘going. Work on

the end of the year.

Transportation in and out of
Oakland has slowed down consid-
erably, with street car riders taking
‘the biggest jolt.

There is only one lane of car
tracks for about five blocks on the
Oakland artery. Consequently,
street cars are routed through five
at a time each way. At one point,
twelvecars going toward town were
lined up waiting to get through the
gulch.

Buses are keeping a little better
schedule than the street cars,
although the bus stops have been
juggled around somewhat.

The University’s shipping,depart-
ment has run into some difficulty
because of the repairs. The ship-
ping room entrance is ripped up,
and as yet no provision has been
made for bringing supplies into the
school. Tuck Shop coffee addicts
can rest easy, though, for small
supplies can be carted across the
‘street without too much difficulty.

Repairs Put

the street is expected to last till‘

rule covering frosh men.

New Laboratory Ready
In Engineer Building

A laboratory for the study of plant viruses and virus diseases
has been completed for use by the University of Pittsburgh.

Located‘ at Phipps Conservatory in the old Engineers Build-
ing, the‘ laboratory is under the direction of Dr. W. Conway Price,

The entire Eng'neers Building
was remodeled through a grant of
$29,714.00 from the Sarah Mellon
Scaife Foundation. The building
has been loaned to the University
without cost by the City of Pitts-
burgh, the lease to run for twenty
years.

The remodeling of the building
included the installation of two
research laboratories, an office
lab, dark room, utilities room,
freezing room, together with a main
office and a s ecre tarial office.

Research during the past year
in the plant virus lab has been sup-
ported by two grants, one from the
U. S. Public Health Service anda
second from the National Founda-
tion for Infantile Paralysis.

Under the latter grant the growth
productsof fungi have been studied
for antiveral material. The immed-
iate aim of the research is to find
through plant virus work an agent
which will immunize human s
against certain harmful nviruses.

‘Groups Set 
Busy Week 
For Frosh 

With University organizations
hastening to make the incoming
‘freshmen feel at home at Pitt, new
men should soon be seeing the ,
brighter side of college life. I

However the start of school con-
fronts them with what is probably
the widest and strongest. red tape
of rules, regulations, and regis-
tration that they have faced up
until this time. ' ‘

The blase upperclassman can
well afford a chuckle at the result.
When the raw freshman soon be-’
comes a polished student, the
‘transformation adds another asset
to the University ledger.

Smoker Tomorrow

The Men's Council Smoker tomor-
row in the Stephen Foster Memorial
will open a week's activities to ,
greet these incoming freshmen and

BY DICK KOVAR
Pitt News Managing Editor

O.K. frosh, you’ve got your dink;
thejquestion your upperclass broth-
ers are ste,wing about- now is
whether you’re ping to wear the
 thing. Which, you'll admit, is rath-
- er presumptuous of said upper-
classmen, or in plainer words for
- the non-English inajors, shows a
lot of crust on their part.
‘ Basica1lYo the wearing of the
dink is just as much a requirement
V as your attendance at orientation
g meetings the first six weeks; both
. are regulations of the Dean of Men's
" Office and are compulsory. The fact
‘that the frosh program is being ad-
s ministered primarily by upperclass
studehts lessens your responsibility
. not one bit.

,, Therefore, it seems you donlt
,_havemuch choice: throw away your
it dink and you’re violating a Univer-
r fsity regulation just as ﬂagrantly as
if you puffed a cigar in the middle
of the Commons Room with a derby
on your head. _ ,

.The same goes for trotting along
" BODK Walk or tripping down the Big-
 elow steps; for any of these actions
h you’ll probably be stopped and
questioned, then warned- not to do it
again. Light that cigar or doff that
dink a few more times and you're in
, hot water. And getting yourself in
{wrong with the DOM the first six
 weeks at Pitt isn’t the best sort of
record to carry around here for the
next four years.

As for all this talk about tribu-
nals and appeals and such, forget
, ‘it. Except for the guy who goes out
and looks for trouble or stooges for
‘some upperclass joker, not one of
you will get within spitting distance
of any court closer than the Oak-
land Police Station-after all, a
guy has to park somewhere.

~ So much for the teeth of the pro-
gram, which have been flashed
around rather too much of late.

. \‘ Let's consider the assets to the
wearing of the dink: you’lldiscover
, upperclassmen greeting you with at

least a “Hi, frosh," and you'll be
able to recognize your brothers-in-

‘misery yourself. And it won't take

long -for you to realize that the

Class of '53 will be the first one
actually defined as an individual,
integrated class in many years.
And that’; just what the dink pro-
gram is aimed at.,Maybe you'll
even get a kick out of boasting,
“Myclass was the ﬁ_rst to wear the
dinkat Pitt.”

The dink belongs to theold col-
lege spirit that the seriousness of
war and its aftermath swept away.
It's time that a spot of color was
“added to a campus that has seen
too much khaki and olive drab. The

   
 
   
   
   
   
   
   
  
  
   
  

‘first step in the revival of the good
it natured inter-class rivalry that
‘once tempered the strain and work
“of getting an education.
, The only person who can pos-.
. isibly be annoyed by the dink is
yourself. If the sight of a blue-and-
Vgold beanie hurts the eyes ofran
upperclassman, he doesn't have to
"look, at it. _
It's your dink, mister. If you
.don’t like it, you’ll find ways to
insure that you and every freshman
[after you won’t have to wear It.
Just go slow. You might even get
to like the darn thing.

lStinks !

By DONALD GIFFIN
Pitt News Editor

Pitt has already consumed a
painful decade rebuilding a shat-
tered football reputation because,
when the Sutherland powerhouses
of the '30s were being broadsided
with Vover-subsidization charges,
the “Bowman Code,” designed to
remedy the situation, went too far.

~ So has Men's Council, which
didn't know where to stop with its
freshman program. i

The freshman camp-orientatiom
class-smoker-mixer dance lineup,
» which has courted freshmen through
their first weeks at Pitt the last
few years, did not satisfy Council.

Despite previous failures here,
the councilmen voted in a compul-
sory beanie-wearing statute for
freshmen and is now stumbling
through the process of setting up a
cumbersome series of enforcement
and judicial regulations.

The "Dink Doctrine” was enac-
ted aftersome watchful politicking.
Council held it back three years,
its eye gluedto the registration
figures showing the proportion of
veterans in incoming classes.

Now that the ratio has tumbled
to two ex-servicemen among every
ten males entering Pitt this fall,
Council has chanced it.

This amounts to two-faced man-
euvering. Council's Joe Wolfe,
chairman of the customs and trad-
itions committee which directs the
program, insists that» beanie-wear-
ing is designed ‘not td humiliate,
not to haze the fresbmen,but is to
be kept on a mature level.”

Yet'Council feared, apparently,
the reaction of a preponderantly-
veteran frosh population. What else
can this be than a slap at a group
composed mainly of high school
graduates, a reflection on their
maturity?

Simply the wearingéof beanies is
not the sole objection that is
raised. The haphazard policing
system and the ridiculous series of
"courts” planned to "try the ac-
cused" are wide open to the
charge of carrying things, too far.

According to the present policy
outlined to a group of upperclass
activity leaders by Wolfe and
Freshman Advisor Edwin].
McIntosh at a smoker last week,
any stulent can report a freshman
for breaking the beanie law.

One upperclassman is looking
forward to faking’ out an eager
plainclothesman. He purchased a
beanie the other day, announcing
his intention of parading up and
down ODK Walk with the cap pro-
truding from his pocket, just wait-
ing to be challenged.

Council,_ attempting to throw a
democratic plank into its compul-
sory platform, has envisioned ‘a
miniature judicial system and has
set up an elaborate series of ‘courts
to hear the "cases” of the arrest-
ed frosh offenders.

In the company of his“attorney,”
the triedgfreshman, after having _his
case heard by an ll-man, appoint‘
ive Upperclass Court, can, if dis-
satisfied, run the gauntlet of
appeal courts, a la Dred Scott.

Some upperclassman cackled
happily upon hearing the beanie
regulations. "Now, by gawda
they’ll be able to tell an upper-
classman from a freshie .”
Hasn't it been terrible that sopho-

’ On the boulevard

Registration is where strange
things break out like hives during
tomato season. For instance, one
of the bottlenecks at the photo-
graphic salon at the rear of Syria
Mosque was caused by students
who couldn't remember when they
were born.

The three photographers, who
snapped 2,975 pictures Monday,
certainly created no bottleneck.
They snapped so fast that some
‘ID cards will probably -turn up with
two heads instead of one. A -

As usual there was a heavy
demand for pasteboards, and Head
Bouncer J. Gilbert Quick was seen
nlmbly apprehending students who
had the audacity to enter at 9 a.m.
with a 9:31} card.

Band members and football play-
ers got top priority, and a bands-
man and a civilian were seen ex-
changing clothes in the privacy of
a parked car. Too bad the football
players didn't appear in their
regalia.

Best trick of the long week was
pulled by a daring, unidentified
student who waited until all the
registrars had left theircard boxes
at about 4:30 on Monday. He walked
around and helped himself, then
calmly walked out.

Confusion was more evident than
in the last few registrations. Many
people got stuck between the tables
and couldn't get to the writing
tables.

Result: they were scattered all
over theorchestra platform, making
our schedule cards, etc. At the
Masonic Temple they brought out
adding machines to help total the
book costs. At the exit the Owl
held bargain day with subscrip-
tions_ going at $5 and a plushy
your-name-on-in-gold edition retail-
ing for $6.50.

Sélt In a Wound

During the summer many things
changed around the Cathedral.
There are holes in the lawn, an
easier form from the VA, and a sim-
plified method of separating fresh-
men from people. But at least one

thing is the same: the quality(?)

and price('!) of Tuck Shop coﬂ'ee.

It seems strange that many
places a little higher on the social
register can afford to pour for a
nickel. What's this we’ve been
hearing about low overhead?

Facts You Should Know

English professor Charles Arnold
was the firstigraduate of the first
school of journalism in the world.
He graduated from the University
of Missouri School of Journalism‘ in
1909 with a B.S. in J. The first
educational radio‘ broadcast in the
world was sent over the air waves
from Pitt's studio in 1922-via
station KDKA.

A desk that was used by Abra-
ham Lincoln is in operation at the
Western Pennsylvania Historical
Society on Bayard Street.

Dr. H. C. (Doc) Carlson, Pitt
basketball coach and famed referee
halter, was a charter member of the
basketball officials association.

Dr. Alexander Silverman, head of
the chemistry department and ‘a
glass expert, was once dismissed
froma job as a chemist with a glass
company after he perfected a new
alabaster glass used widely in
lighting. Reason: he asked for a

-raise from his $l(.l0-a-month salary.

needed a bracer, he discovered
that some friends had guzzled the

The Junior Class Cabinet begins
its year of activities with the
"Four-M Forum”. The Forum will

The highlight of the affair will
be an explanation of the four M's:

The members of the junior class
and their special guests, women
transferring from Johnstown, will
inspect the new twelfth floor kit-

The Pitt Building Fund Cam-
paign could be labled an El Dorado
with a moral. It is something when
a university can appeal, for, and
receive, a sum like $12,700,000

from its friends, neighbors, and

alumni.

At the current rate of exchange
that means something like $7,500,
000 has now been collected to
start the huge Pitt Building Pro-
Sfaﬂh with $5,200,000 left to go be-
f°re reaching the 312,700,000 goal.
the prospectors will have to work
just a little harder if they are to
meet their drive deadline of Jan.,
1950. .

Yes, everything runs smoothly at
El Dorado. Even a faint air of mys-
tery heightens the Old West ill-
usi.o_‘n. The donor of the largest
gift.o_f- the campaign so far remains
anonymous. It is a $3,000,000 con-
tribution pledged on the condition
that it is matched by a like amount
to be used for the proposed 35,500,
000 Medical Center.

The campaign will be rolling
faster now to reach its end-of-the-
year climax. So far the mother lode
of the big district corporations,
trust funds, and foundations has
yielded generously to the modern

To the Pitt Students —

We know that it is your fervent

highest standard possible. This is
our aim, and it is our desire to pro-
vide athletic activity and facilities
for as manyistudents as possible.
Pitt's success is directly propor-
tionate to your interest and par-
ticipation. _ y

We expect the student body to
apply ample pressure to see that
every able bodied young man CI p-
able of developing into a represent-
ative of any Varsity sport team
comes out and gives his best
efforts. In all cases, we know that
this development takes time, and
individuals should have determin-
ation and perseverance to work four
years, if necessary, to win a cov-
eted "P“ sweater and give us
winning teatns. _

ATHLETIC DIRECTOR TOM I-IAMILTON

In a prepared statement Athletic Director Tom Hamilton today urged
Pitt students to give their utmost support to the school's athletic pro-
gram. The text of Hamilton's statement follows:

We want athletes who are capable 3

‘Northwestern, running off the T- ’

This is Mike Mi1ligan’s last ride on the GI football machine he’s

been getting out of the 89-mile every September since he became ahead

coach. Next year he’ll trade it in for a fresh, souped-up job with sad-
dle shoes and a high school sweater.
So Mike may well be pondering whether it is a good trade-in.

One college coach has remarked that he is fed up with the post-war

eta’s "V/PA” players and will be glad to get back to the high school
graduates. The inference is, of course, that the well-traveled and some-
what grizzled GI gets just a little bored at times with the game of foot-

ball.

The high school star with the
peach-fuzzed cheeks and the do-

kovc narkouskie
or-die try, opines this same coach,
will put lots more elbow grease
behind his shovel.

/

Of course, the oint the man
overlooks is that e matured G1

by and large has probably had a
lot more on the brain than did his
pre-war predecessor. A couple
of extra years of living were
bound to give him a mental ad-
VBDCRBCO
Here at Pitt, however, Milligan
may be able to watch the return to
“the teen-aged player with- more
optimism than many other college
coaches will show. The reason is
that some of his shrewdest ﬂay-
ers have been the non-veterans.

The News is late to-day due to
technical difficulties beyond the

control of the staff. The editors
regret any inconvenience caused
by the delay.

Take, for example, Bernie Bark-
ouskie who came here from Kulp-
mont High.

There have been times when
the enemy kicked the chunky guard
and his teammates all over the

I field. But Barkouskie kept his

an eventu y e oun ow and
why he was etting the works. The
howshiand w 3;, passed on to the
coac ng sta , sometimes made
it possible to remedy the weak-
nesses. ~
In addition to Barkouskie you
could point to Nick Bolkovac,
Carl DePasqua, Bimbo Cecconi,
and possibl others as examples

you would have to put the GI down
as generally the more nimble think-
er in this post-war football age.
Still, Mike Milligan has gotten

some good football from bo s
who never saw the inside 0 a
barracks, so the return to nor-
malcy should not prove too
much of a jolt here at Pitt.

For Opener

Pitt’s Jayvee football team
moved onto the gridiron Monday to
officially share the spotlight with
the varsity and freshmen when
practice sessions opened at Ells-
worth Field.

Some 50 candidates for the team
reported to Coach Paul Sager for
the initial drills. Sager, in his
first year as a Pitt grid mentor,
put the squad through conditioning

exercises and light drills.

New Method,  Gives,             
Paper Bold Look

Production of the News has taken on a new aspect this year
with the advent of a newspaper composed by differential space
iustifier machines. ‘

The differential space justifier resembles an electric type-
writer and comes equiped with changeable type. After the type

.Lis inserted and adjustments are

made, the DS] is ready to set copy.
The operator types a line, spaces
and retypes the line. This second
line is the one which appears in
the paper.

From the DS] machines the print-
ed copy goes to the production e‘di-
tor, who cuts the columns and
pastes them in the proper place on
a page-size sheet ofgpaper. The
production staff has already lined
off the sheet in columns and the

ads In position.

Headlines are set up in fototype.
This is light cardboard with dif-
ferent sizes of type imprinted on
it. After"~t_he heads are set, they
are pasted above the story they
go with.

When the pages are completely
finished, they are sent to the print-
er to be photographed and printed
