Oakland Merchants Help in
Cash Crisis

Despite the banking holiday and
the subsequentdack of cash in the
Pittsburgh district, owners of restau-
rants, boarding houses, leaders of the
fraternities and even the chairman of
a dance have evinced conﬁdence in
the ability of University students to
meet their ﬁnancial obligations and

' are extending credit to students who

are in diﬁiculty.

The proprietors of almost every one
of the Oakland ‘restaurants, the Uni-
versity Cafeteria, and other ‘retail

«d-ealers were almost as one in recog-'

nizing the hardship the present money
situation might impose and in voicing
their willingness to be of aid.

Through Manager ‘Samuel Strauss,
it was announced that the Interfrater-
nity Cooperative Buying Ass-sociation
has extended credit to its members,
and is, itself, ‘beneﬁting by credit ex-
tension from its Wholesalers.

Leaders of the campus fraternities
stated that the usual credit policy
will be -pursued during the bank holi-
day. ‘Checks were being accepted ‘in
payment for bills and a full conﬁdence
in the student's ability to pay his
house obligations was in evidence.

E. H. R. Pegs’. Eng. ’33, president of
the Engineering Association, stated
Wednesday that, if banking restric-
tions are‘ not lifted by today, credit‘
will be given to students who have
no cash but who wish to attend the
associations dance tonight. Payment
for tickets by engineering students
who are short of funds might be.
made at a. lat-er7'tim‘e, he said. -

Oakland restaurants were giving
University students regular meal tick-
ets, allowing them the lbeneﬁt of the
ten per cent discount normally given,
and accepting their I. 0. U.’s in re-
turn. Neighborhood roominghouse
proprietors likewise were‘ extending
almost unlimited credit and, in most
instances, accepting checks. Several

“I have always extended credit to
my boys in the past. Why shouldn’t
I do so now?” -

Although ‘the major portion, of the

tive tr-a.t;e.1:i1_i.ti_es..‘,Co.unci1 did..ﬁ13d.,t19I.1.9.
to discuss the potentialities‘ of a new-
ly devised questionnaire for distribu-
tion among. new students. It was
used for the first time with compara-
tive success this semester.

The questionnaire, which from now
on, every incoming student will be
asked -to ﬁll out, Counicil feels is the
best possible method of determining
the trend of freshman thoughts in re-
gard to fraternity membership.

It asks three questions: “If pro-
vided with the opportunity will you
sometime during your University work
go into a fraternity?” “If during your
freshman year you are provided with
the opportunity -to‘ pledge to a frater-
nity, will you be able to accept?” and
“If your answer is ‘No,’ please indi-
cate your principle reasons.”

Of the approximately 92 freshmen
who entered this semester, 60 per
cent signiﬁed full intention to‘ pledg-
ing during the last rush reason, and
85 per cent indicated -that they fa-
vored joining fraternities some time
during - their University careers.

Since thename of each‘ answering
student was included in the question-
naire, fraternities were afforded add-
ed help -in knowing just which stu-
-dents on which to concentrate during
the rush season. A

Robert Beck, "Bus. Ad. '33, president
of Interfraternity Council, expressed
the satisfaction of Council on the
working process of the questionnaire,
but stated that a more complete and‘re-
vealing one will be devised foruse
next year. ’ ' '

Routine business occupied the re-
mainder of the session. No violations
of rushing regulations by fraternities
were recorded. “Although violations
are exceptions rather than the rule,"
commented Beck, “it is gratifying that
this last period showed a clean slate.
It was a’ good job,‘ well done."

Three’ campus fraternities had been
censured by Council last semester for
committing violations of the rushing
,code.

the, rigid economy observed through-

Disappointment as Seasorfs Most
_ Colorful Dance is Dropped

 

Cancellation of the 1933 Military Ball as a means of relieving

the ﬁnancial strain placed upon University students during the pres-

ent banking crisis was announced this week by General Chairman
George  Hatcher, Col. ’33, and Lt. Colonel E. J. Cullen, professor
and head of the department of military science and tactics.

The decision to cancel the annual ROTC extravaganza came as a
keen disappointment to members of the cadet corps and their fellow‘

Seniors Meel: Today‘ ‘

   

. The Senior Class will meet to-
d.a.y‘at .12:30 o’clock in Room 5,
Dental Annex, .to discuss - the
changing of the diplomas to a
smaller size enclosed in a leather
folder. _

The new diplomas will be re-
duced to 8 by 410 inches.

Mr, John ‘G; Quick, ‘University
registrar,‘ after discussing the
subject with members of the fac-
ulty, feels sure‘ that the new di-
plomas will have a. decided ad-
vantage. Instead of framing his
diploma, the «student will be able
to keep.it intact in a. dust-proof
zfolder. '

The folder will consist of a cover
of blue morocco‘ leather, lined in-
side with gold"-taﬁeta, and will
have the student’s name written
in gold leaf. The diploma will be
held in place with cardboard
strips.

Cap"And Gown

Draws 300 Men

Many Try Out for Chorus,
Cast, Production Staff

 

The first three nights of Cap and
Gown tryouts have brought a turnout
of: almost three hundred men, reports
William Marlatt, director of the 1933
production. .All applicants thus far
have been new, with members of
performances in previous years sched-
uled to appear at the Activities Build-
ing tonight. ‘

Tuesday’s tryouts were given for
new applicants for both men’s and
girls’ choruses. Wednesday evening
men desiring cast parts tried out, and
last night, preliminary practice was
in order for singing and specialty
roles and for business and production
staffs.

All members of last year's show,
“The Silver Domino,” meet with Mar-
latt this evening to conclude the try-
outs. Active practice will begin
next week after applicants are cl1eck-
ed for scholastic standing and for
merit shown in this week's work. The
1933 affair, “Pittsburgh in 1787 and
the Founding of the University,” is
even more music-ﬁlled than the 1932
extravaganza, according to the direc-
tor, and exact verbiage, vim, and
voice from every participant.

‘students, who first learned of the

move from announcements released
.to the downtown press and published
yesterday. The ball was to A have
taken place Friday evening, March
31, with four orchestras and th_o‘en-
tire seventeenth ﬂoor ocf the William
Penn Hotel at the disposal ‘of the
1,200 couples expected’ to attend. '7‘

In a resolution adopted by the ball
committee»-._ Wednesday afternoon it
was stated inpart: ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ .

“In view of the disturbed conditions
-brought about by the present banking
situation, it is believed "to be to’ the
best interests of everybody . . . that
the Pitt Military Ball be cancelled-
this year. ,

“It is not because of any lack of
conﬁdence in the prompt and rapid
ﬁnancial readjustment of our com-
munity that We take‘ this action, ‘but;
solely ‘because we feel it to bevour‘
duty to" give first and foremost’ con-
sideration to the personal interests’ "of
the University student body in this
period of ﬁnancial difficulty that has
«come upon all of us. It is for this
reason alone that we cancel the 1933
Military Ball." .

The resolution, «signed by I-Iatcber
was accompanied by a separate state»-
ment from Lt. Col. Cullen, in which
he added: ‘

“The committee feels that the ne-
cessities of the present banking situa-
tion compel them to take this action
in order to avoid adding to the ﬁnanc-
ial duficulties of our many friends
throughout the University. It is their
feeling that the money used for the
ball could be more appropriately em-
ploved during the present crisis-.”

Although no accurate check-up
could be made, it was reported this
week that approximately one-fourth
of the total number of tickets for the
ball had already been sold. Students
who have purchased tickets will have
their money refunded by the commit-
tee members and cadets from whom
the tickets were obtained, Hatchet
announced. '

Ballroom of the Hotel Schenley as the
setting for the 1933 Pitt News Spring

two-hour dance in the Schenley ball-
room immediately following the show,

The second change is a departure
from the usual manner of selecting
the models. Elsewhere on this page

used for the purpose of suggesting to
the Pitt News Executive Board, who
will select the mannequins, names of
students who could ably serve as mod-

Budding Barrister

Of Public Peace

A slinking, long, low, green road-
stcr shoots along the ribbon-like

stops his car, and receives a
summons to appear immediately
before what he feels sure will be
a very typical naive small town
or village justice of the peace.

“Vvell, here’s where I put one
over on old pappy,” muses the
chap and, with a knowing smirk
on his face strides into the office
of the “Justice” and then sees—— -

Twenty—two-year-old Paul _ Nor-
ton of McKeesport, a second year '
law student at Pitt, graduate of
Franklin and Marshall College

ODK and all the other activities
keys and honorary pins waiting on
that campus for a good man to
take them, and the youngest Jus-
tice of the Peace in the State of
Pennsylvania. The above one is
an everyday occurrence for the
budding barrister.

His is one of the basic courts
in the State Judicial System,
and he is vested with many of
the powers of ajudge. He hears
such offenses as ‘speeding, as-
sault and battery, drunkenness,
and so on.

Norton was recently appointed
by Governor Pinchot to take over
the Versailles Township post after
the death of the previous office
holder.

He is a high standing student
at Law School downtown, ‘and
through his new position has ac-
quired a great deal of information
on law in general that usually
hides from the average book-
dependent student of the profes-
S1011.

Whether Norton is losing any

mined.

Change Seminar Requisites
For Juniors In Petroleum

Beginning with its recent meetings,
a change has been engineered in the
conducting of the petroleum reﬁning

students in the junior class were re-
quired to attend only the one general
seminar’ meeting that takes place
regularly during the fourth hour on
Thursdays. For this hour, they re-
ceived a credit.

In addition to attending this general
seminar, the senior students are re-
quired to attend a technical seminar
that takes place on Tuesday, This
seminar requires outside preparation,
and also carries a credit. This se-
mester the junior students must also
take the technical session together
with the seniors.

Ewers, Burrell See Communism
Failure In Destitute Red Russia

While Government Gathers
In All Revenue, Peasants
Starve, Says Pastor ‘

By Jack Bunker

Ivan of Russia may be waving his
red ﬂag aloft and shouting “commun-
ism” to his heart's content, but it
doesn’t mean a thing, for the land of
the old Czars has gone capitalistic-to
state capitalism.

Such was the observation. made by
Dr, John Ray Ewers, pastor of the
East End Christian Church, who has
himself been to Russia and who, on
his frequent trips to Europe, comes
in contact with many Americans work-
ing there.

There is no communistic sharing in
Russia today, such as the American-
communist-convert would have us be-
lieve. Instead-, the government col-
lects everything: grain, cattle, ﬁre-
wood, garden produce. Everything
that is sellable abroad it exports
to collect money for the realiza-
tion of the ﬁve-year plan. And poor
Ivan in the meantime! He starves
for the paternal state. His. daily diet
is cabbage soup, made with
icream, --blackxlbread and ﬁsh, and cu-
cumbers as a. delicacy. If fortunate,
he might get meat once a week.

But the Russian today is better
oﬁ than he was in the era of the nobil-
ity, Dr. Ewers believes. When you
consider that his country is in the
same condition now as was our land
during’ the ralroad building, expansion
period, the Russian has done wonders
with his new freedom. And there
we have another slant on Russian life.

Whether or not the Russian is free,
according to our conception of free-
dom, is a big question, for in Russia
there is the GPU, the elaborate or-
ganization of government secret po-
lice, under which the people live in
constant dread. Your brother, your

best friend, even your mother, may

be a member of it, and may, for the
state, -betray you for any seditious
statement. The members of the GPU

Increasing Frequency of Colds Noted; Bureau Reiterates
Simple Precautions to be Followed for Protection

 

The Student Health Service reminds .the student body of the increasing

frequency of colds!

Whether it is because of the decreased resistance of the individual as a
result of prolonged physical and mental strain or because of an increased
virulence of the causative organism, or a combination of both, the fact re-
mains that the average student is apparently susceptible to upper respiratory

registrations at the Student Health:

infections at this time of the year.

Service of athletes as well as non-
athletes.

It is not the common cold itself
which is feared, as are its complica-
tions, of which pneumonia is the
most dreaded. Pneumonia is a noto-
l"lOUS cause of death in the Pittsburgh
district. The pneumonia season dates
from October through March, travel-
ing in waves which reach their crest
every four to six weeks. March is
considered one of the WOl'St‘I1‘l0lll‘l.lS
for pneumonia. For the major part
of this winter, the number of pneu-
monia. cases has reached a new low
in the history ‘of the district, but it
does not mean that March will ‘follow
suit. Therefore every individual
should take ordinary precautions in
protecting his health.

This may be done by following
these simple routine hygenic meas-
ures:

1. Rest at least 8 hours daily.
(Avoid fatigue.)

Drink 1 to 1%,, quarts of ﬂuid
daily.

Eat wholesome food at regular
intervals and just sulﬁcient
to satisfy the appetite.
Regular bowel activity.

Keep entire body warm and
dry.

Bathe daily.

Plenty of fresh air.
Moderate exercise
. doors.

If the student should be susceptible
to cold or “catch a cold." he should
report either to his family physician
or to the Student Health Service be-
cause: '

1. Only by examination may
the cause for susceptibility
be found.

Institution of early treat-
ment means less opportunity

of complications and a. more
rapid recovery.

Proper advice may be given

as to isolation of the conta-
gion and protection of
others.

better than cure!

Another Russian organization which
impressed Dr. ‘Ewersduring his trip
was the Young Komsomols, compris-
ing over 4,000,000 boys and girls. Fine
specimens of youth physically, these
young defenders of the fatherland, of
their own free will, frown on youth-

tirely from drinking and smoking, and

for the Czars, never was. In a ﬁeld

hooded peasant woman patting a new
tractor and muttering, “Little Jesus,

The li.ttle Russian mouse is biting

Seldom, Colonel Burrell says, do

everyone within the conﬁnes of the

Deans Deﬁne
College Aims

Miss Amos Represents Pitt.
at St. Paul Conclave

"That college is for the exception-
ally able, and that the American uni-
versities have two tliinzlt to do, name
ly: to educate the masses, to devise
means of discovering the exception-
ally able, and to ﬁnd places for them,"
was the topic of discussion and con-
sensus of the members of the Ex-
ceptionally Able symposium at the
national convention of the Deans of
Women in St. Paul.»

Dean ’l‘l1yrsa.I\V'. Amos, who repre-
sented Pitt at the convention, spoke
at the symposium, which was at-
tended by Dean Stimson of Goucher,
President Cowling of Carlton Col-
lege, Dean Tracy of the Women's Med-
ical College of Philadelphia, Dr. Ruth.
Strang of Columbia University, and
President Converse of Summit school.

Outside events of special interest
included a. sacred concert by St.
Olifs a cappello choir, luncheon at
the University of Minnesota, and tea
at St. Catharine's College.

“The convention afforded an un-
usually helpful and inspiring pro-
gram,” said Miss Amos on her re-

;turn. to the campusthis week after

:1 week's absence because of ill-
ness. Dean Amos returned to Pitts-
burgli February 25, but because of a
severe cold was forced to remain at
home for several days,

The Panthers are expected to make

Revenge

Mountaineer boxers will do their

l)ff:5l'. to entertain the Pitt boxing team
at Morgiintown tomorrow night, and
if the Pitt boxing team has its way,
the score will be, Pitt 6, W'est Vir-
ginia 1. Incidentally, 6-1 happens to
be the score that the Mountaineer
boxers (lofeated the Panthers when
the two teams met at Pittsburgh
earlier in the season, and the Pitt
team is out for revenge in a big way.

The Moiiiitaineers, newly crowned
Easterii Conference boxing champions
are heavy favorites to repeat their
previous victory. The West Virginia
team has yet to be defeated in compo-
tition this year, and the Pitt chances
for victory are very, very small.

(‘.l1ai‘ley_‘:.Slini" Jungc will try
his second victory in ﬁve days tomor-
row night, and will likely meet Baika-

watch from the sidelines. Peter

the 115-pound ﬁght from Littlehales
by technical knockout in the third
round. Both boys were too wild to
do much coiicentratioii on the ﬁner
points of the game. An exhibition

gof the evening.

Bob Ackley, Pitt, and Crone, W’. &

. _Coniiden,c,e and Common Sense

ONFTDENCE, the most dependable‘ symptom of a. nation’s good
.9 health’, this week allied itself with common sense for an unop-
posedinvasion of the Uiiiversity campus.

In't.hc' face of what appeared to be a national emergency, a
slightly sob'ered.Jol1n College has been enjoying his normal break-
fasts and going,.as usual, about the routine, of attending class. While
not entirely ‘undisturbed, he has been far from being morosely con-
cerned over the condition of the national ﬁnances.

Some students who have been living on the campus away from
their own homes Vere caught without suﬁicient cash to carry them
over the brief bank holiday. Herc conﬁdence 011 the part of local
retail and_wholesale mc1'cl1a}1ts brought about a swift adjustment
to meet ‘the unusual conditions. R-ooming house  restaurant pro-
prietors,  particular, met the situation with 'imme’diate» extensions
of credit for the students who had not the refuge of the fraternity
house. to fall back upon.‘ ' V p A

Meanwhile, the liiterfratcr-nit.y Cooperative Buying Association
sought to guarantee the sustenance of its members’ dependents
through extensions of credit from the group of approved whole-
salers. Thc association was successful. '

All t.hcs_c evidences of" a willingness to cooperate and to share
during a tiincof need might not have been expected from the first
ironic warning that was given ina.ugura.tion spectators Saturday in
"Washington. ‘Even as thc—former‘New York governor arose from
his seat on thciiiaugural platform to repeat the words that made
him the nation’s President, an-other-message was-being gi.vc11 the
crowd of 150,000 onlookers. One Washiiigtoii newspaper, its front
page unadorned by the red and blue ink of its competitors, carriecl
the scarchead, “Baiilrs Closing in All States.” But in Washington,
as in our ownimmediatc vicinity, the healthy optimism of a trusting
public was not to be dispelled. Even those early reports were not
enough. to dampen the spiiits of the “common nian” of campaign
day fame who trampcd the crowded streets of \Vashington last
Saturday. 4 ' _» i A

Then, as now, the role pf the professional alarmist was an un-

popular one.

G 8 %

Common‘ sense "and a commendable regard for the gen-“

eral welfare ‘of’ the University student body combined this week to
remove the iinnual‘ Military Ball" from the‘ scmester’s social calendar.
‘The decision to cancel the Ball came both as a surprise and a dis-

.a.ppoint.mcnt1to' the members of the cadet corps and their friends. -

C-cnc1'a‘lly conceded to be the University ’s most elaborate social

‘function, the Military Ball this_ year probably would have sui-passed ._
‘the successes .c£1'the'...paist:- two seasoiis.» Vllith the four orchestras '

Tunannounccd, the committee already had disposed of approximately

one-fourthof itsiillottcdi tickets. The a,sscssmcnt for the dance was '

one within‘ ‘reason ‘for such an elaborately planned affair; this alone
would go fartoward assuring ‘its ﬁ_na.nc’ia.l -success. '

Herc, iindc‘ccl,"is’aI1 exan'iplc' of.‘ tl~1'c"‘kind of sane, judicious a.d- -
.ba.ug'h. Morgan, Miller, Burton, Hosmer: bas-

justment that. any social’ group  any univcrsit_v should‘-be‘ willing
to carry o~ut..i'wl'i‘en conditions"‘warrant the action. The action of
Colonel 'C1il‘l'c1i ‘and-55t.l1c' stucl-c1'nt« c:om_mittcc.._in ' cancelling" the dance
was one motiyated by a concern for the well-being of the students,

and their pareiits, during. the present pteriodofc ﬁnancial reorga.ni_za- ,
tion. 'l‘l1e}ncedL_for'scns1ble a'd3ustmen't_ of" at least one phase of the

campus soc'iaslf.pr'ogram,. apparent‘ all year," was thus recognized and
fulﬁlled ati~si:_tim_e1-"when common sense dictated that something be
done for the cornmon good- .' , _ - ~ 1 , ' ' 

The cancellation, as pointed out in the stateinents of General
Chairman Ijlatchcr and Colonel -Cullen, is not to be interpreted in
any measure ‘as a lack of conﬁdence in the ability of the community
reprcsentezl;i1x_,,,oi1i; student body to return‘ to ﬁnancial normalcy.
Plainly, it is an attempt to relieve and aid——i.'ather than to confound

and hinder»-a situation that has affected us all.
=il= # it

The publicbtion of a'stc_ztement in a recent issue of the
News rcvcalingtvliat one out of’evcry -four -:§tudcnts enrolled in the
University is receiving ﬁnancial aid through deferred payment of
tuition was still an earlier evidence of the “credit. machincr_v” that
has been working for the beneﬁt of the unclcrgraduatc.

There, too, the note of optimism was sounded in the conﬁdence ,

placed by the Univcrs.it_v instudcnts who “promised to pay” and
kept their promises, The policy of extending credit to students
worthy ofircceiving aid through deferred tuition payments has es-
caped, to date, the abuse which such avcrcdit system. might have felt
in_.an.y but an e(lucationa.l institution.

D’ ' There are-, apparcnt.ly,'an integrity of character and an honesty
of purpose among students that are worth preserving. ’I‘hc_v exist,
certainly, at." all timcs;'but, that adversity should be the only cause
for recognizing them is as unfortunate. as the fact that we must
accept the existence ofthe adversity itself.

A Protest Exhibition

There is a. rumor abroad to the
effect that many of the established
and amateur artists about town are
organizing a large scale exhibition
along the lines of the present Asso-
ciated Artists show. Whether this
will be a protest exhibition or not
is not deﬁnitely known. Of one thing,
however, the artists themselves speak
with certainty——,tl_1at (through and
through')‘tl1is show will ‘evince fair
play. Inﬂuence.——that intangible yet
highly evident side of most Carnegie
exhibitions—-will play no part, and
artists of meritorious work through-
out the city will have an opportunity
to show their paintings under the
most unprejudiced circumstances———no
palms, no medals, no ribbons. From
this angle, such a show will cer-
tainly be a protest against the Asso-
ciated Exhibition with its all too ob-
vious concession to the John Kane
school of painting. Just when the
exhibition will be held, where, or who
will contribute has not yet been pub-
lished. It ought to niaterialize, for all
of us would welcome an artistic en-
deavor that would not attempt to con-
vince us that bad, photographic im-
itation is art, nor try to arouse public
advertising ,_ through questionable
awards. .

 

Myra‘ Hess »

The recital by Myra. Hess concluded
the‘ series of Pittsburgh Art Society
programs with a brilliant evening.
H-er group of selections was one the
whole audience seemed to enjoy, she
herself was cauglit in 3. gracious en-
thusiasm and presented ﬁve encores
——not one of which represented a. trite
concession on her part to the usual
sentimental encores‘ for piano. Every-
thing she did showed extreme ‘ﬁnish
in touch and in timing, and to this
she gave just about the right degree
of emotion. The Brahms was es-
pecially well done. Alnone of the
three lntermezzi was among the ﬁnesl.
compositions of their type by the
composer. Myra Hess missed none
of their greatness, and in the Brahms’
Rhapsodie in E ﬂat major‘ she struck
the most robust and sweeping mood
of the evening. The entire Beeth-
oven Sonata was soundly presented.
One feels lvlyra. Hess understands
Beethoven; this came out particular-
ly in the Allegro molto movement.
VVith the Chopin Preludes she seemed
to miss something. Just what it was
is difﬁcult to say, for one cannot
criticise her on technical elements;
she has too much ﬁnish for“that.
The fault seemed more in a subdued
emotional approacl; which did not al-
low her to realize completely the
depth and lyric richness of Chopin.
It is trite, of course, to mention Chop-
in’s poetry; but the reality of its
existence remains, and Myra. Hess
“does not go asmfar as she might in
capturing all that Chopin intended.

The Don Cossacks

remains only one musical perform-
ance of note on the regular seasonal
program. This is the Don Cossack
Russian Singers. \Ve remember them
from other years as perhaps the most
phenomenal item of the whole con-

one ﬁnd the music of Russia more
ﬁnely evoked or male voices orches-
trated in such a peculiar, powerful
manner. No one goes away unim-

in many fundamental points.

Discusses Protestant Tencts
Dr. Lang, Talking Before Inquiry Group, Outlines Prem-

and Protestantism

 

An exposition of the tenets of Protestant faith, contrast between
Catholicism and Protestantisni, and a. defense of religion in general,
featured the speech of Rev. Dr. David Lang, pastor of the Shady
Avenue Presbyterian Church, before the Inquiry Forum Wednesday

Dr. Lang pointed out that Protestzuitism and "Catholicism agree
“Both Catholics and

Protest.ants, ’ ’ he

sin, a Savior, soul. and immortzility.
In this respect we differ from non-
religionists.”

The oliaracteristic most peculiar to '

the Protestant church is the thesis of
direct approach to God through
prayer, Dr. Lang declared. “Our
premise,” said the speaker, “is that
the just shall live by faith, and need
no penance or prescribed rites to in-
sure their salvation."

-“We haveno fear thatlany of our
members will ever learn too much
about religion. Oufaith is essentially
linked with reason, and we encourage
education and progress.” Dr. Lang
asserted. « *

“Pr'otesl:ant faith is not merely
what-its name implies,” said Dr. Lang.

“Nothing can be built upon mere
protest; one must have something
positive. That we have in our church.

Despite our one hundred and fifty
denorniiiations, we are uniﬁed--uniﬁed
not like an arniy, with its blind order-
taking. but uniﬁed in life and in
spirit.”

Dr. Lang’s talk was the second of
three dealing with,contempora1'y re-
ligion. “Wliat is Juda.is1n?” was
answered by Rabbi B. B. G-lazer of the
Rodef Slialom congregation last week_
Next VVednesday Father Sigmund
Cratz of...the De Paul Institute will ex-
plain, “What is Catholicisni?”

Potter Stresses Cultural

Background For Enginc§e_r.§

 

The need for some allowance in the
schedules of undergraduate engineer-
ing students for cultural and educa-
tional subjects as against a full cur-
riculum of technical credits was
stressed here last Thursday by Dean
A. A. Potter of the Engineering
School of Purdue University_ Dean
Potter, present national president of
the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers and one of the most promi-
nent ﬁgures in that profession today,
was brought here by the mechanical
engineering department of the Univer-
sity under Dean. E. A. Holbrook and
Professor John A. Dent. — a

Dean Potter mentioned the unfav-
orable aspect of the engineering pro-
fession for the next few years fol‘
graduates who are trained only in the
tricks of their trade. He concerned
‘iis remarks with the prospects for

engineering graduates, and time" and
again emphasized the "importance to
students to make room in their
scliedules for a; number of out-and-out
culture courses. A bi'oad'know1edge
of the world in general and of the
other man's interests, an ability to
speak easily and without self-con
sciousness, and a fair knowledge of
what he termed the “soc1‘2tl-graces"-
were all included by the speaker as
necessary or contributing qualities to
success in the profession,

“Too many seasoned and experi-
enced engineers are out of jobs today
to -allow a mediocre‘ graduate much of
a chance,” he stated. “And a large
percentage of those unemployed men
are today back in school—-and are
concentrating on courses of a general
and cultural nature, not purely tech-
nical inforniation subjects."

acting was concerned, but as to the

direction we prefer Miss Quarrie be-

fore the footlights rather than pull-

The other one-actor, “Collum-bine~,”

light the ultra-modern ideas of a girl

The‘ big city and the smaller
boroughs swap smoke. Eacli com-
munity pollutes every other com-
munity and regulation of uiiy one
cannot bring general relief.

.Even.-state regula-tion will be to no
avail in’ sections such as New York
and‘ New Jersey, where both states
are engaged in dirt producing occupa-
tions. Likewise, Missouri and Illinois
would need to take joint action to
give relief to St. Louis and East St.
Louis. ' _

“The smoke nuisance has become
a. serious embarrassment to 1'9:-ll es-
tate,” asserted the speaker, “and a
sizeable threat to the residential qual-
ities of many cities. For that reason,
progressive communities are coming
to see that they cannot indeﬁnitely
postpone consideration of the sub-
ject. ‘ -

‘‘It is my suggestion that adequate
surveys be made, covering ‘sources of
po~llui:.ion,. the -evalus.tion...of.. rome.-.
dies. and the possible need for legis-
lation——dnd that includes ordinances
for home furnaces.”
