Speculation that the Mellons are the anonymous bidders
who offered $170,000 for the Syria Mosque parking lot con-
tinued to mount~today._ According to reports the lot was to

I be turned over to the University as a site for one of the
' buildings _on the Building Program.

The $170,000,bid was rejectedat a meeting of the Sylfia

Temple Association on Oct. 3. The Shriners voted unani-

A/mously against accepting the: bid.‘

They are reported to have also
refused a bid of $400,000 several
years ago.
Mellon Unavailable

Richard K. Mellon, president of
the Mellon National Bank and
former Pitt trustee, was unavail-
able for comment, fjbut a spokes-
man declined to say if the ‘Mel-
lon family was trying to buy the
property for eventual use of the
University. He would not, how-

ever, say. that the Mellons were
not interested.

He said, “No, I wouldn’t say
they weren’t trying to buy it.”

The fact that the Mellon name
is the ﬁrst to come to mind when
donations are made to the Univer-
sity is not~surprising in view of
their past relations with the
school.‘ I .

. According to Dr-" J .,G. Quick, university registrar,‘ there
has been a decrease of 26.18 in full-time students since last

September.

_In contrast-,*'however; the part-timej-student- enrollment
has increased one percent. There are 77 more students in the

The decrease is indicative of

the general trend since 1947 when

enrollment reached an all time
high of 25,000. Since then the

‘/— number of students has dropped

considerably each year. In 1948
the enrollment had dropped to
23,000, and the decline continued

Dissension Hits

1 Banks of SC

The ﬁrst sign this year of in-
ternal strife in Student Congress
appeared at last Monday’s meet-
ging during a squabble over meth-
odsiin choosing members of the
social and appointments commit-
tee.

Sam Shapiro, athletic committee
representative, called for changes
in the committee choice‘ system
used by Jim J ohnston,csocial, and
Bill McKinley, appointments com-
mittee chairmen.

The students chosen by Johns-
ton and McKinley were ﬁnally ap-
proved over Shapii-o’s objections."
I Fee Discussed

Another discussion during the
meeting, led by Dean of Men The-

, odore W. Biddle, arose out of the

suggestion made last week’ that
Congress probe the use and
breakdown of the University Fee.

Dean Biddle began with a dis-
cussion of the, Student—Activities
fee, noting, “We want students to
be informed. and understand the
information that is available to
them.‘ ‘ ’ _

The . activities fee, explained
‘Biddle, is a 71/3 per cent appro-

of Trustees by recommendations’

 pli-

enrollment ﬁgures for the under-
graduate schools only show a de-
crease _of 1714 students, or 23 per
cent. In the undergraduate_ de-
partments the nursing school has
suffered most with 39 per cent
drop in students. .
In the graduate schools th

School of Public Health has been
hit hardest‘ by a decrease of 46

.per cent, with the Graduate School

running a close second with 40
per cent.
Nursing School“

The 52 per cent increase in part-
time nursing students keynotes the
general increase in enrollment in
the part—time divisions.

Exceptions are the schools of
Mines,.and Education which show
a slight decrease in enrollment. ‘

Reasons Offered

One of the explanations most
often oﬁered for the decline is
that there are fewer 18-year-olds
than in former years. Today’s
freshmen were born in the depres-
sion years_ of 1932 and 1933 when
the national birth—rate» dropped.

The increased opportunities in
outside industry are taking their
toll of prospective college stu-
dents, too, as is the draft which
continues to detour high school
graduates away from Pitt.

" The new independent movement

The Pitt Independent Associa-

meet the social needs of men ‘and

Eighty percent of Pitt’s under-
graduates, according to Reese, do
not belong to social clubs. “The
PIA has-been reorganized to unite
and help the students, and to
make them feel that they. too, are
part of the University,” he said.

The independent movement has
been active nationally since 1925,
and on the Pitt campus since 1928,
Reese explained.

Pitt’s independent association
has had an erratic history, how-
ever. The most recent ﬂurry of in-

dependent political action occur-

The purpose of the League is to
provide students with the motiva-

Tasteless and 1A bsurd   

By DICK SNYDER__ . _
Outside of arousing my sympathy for most of the actors \
involved, John Patrick’s The Curious Savage (which opened  

at the Pittsburgh Playhouse last Friday) ‘struck me as being-
a remarkably inept and tasteless little glue-pie of a show.

   

’Whistle,.a sparkless triﬂe of sev-
eral _seasons ago, ‘concerns itself
with Mrs. Ethel Savage and her
rather frantic attempts to spend
ten . million dollars gratifying the
latent. whims of her fellowmen.
For this, she is conﬁned to a high-
priced loony bin by her step chil-
dren who are bent on relieving
her of ‘the ten million for them-
selves.
Here, also, are people named
, Fairy’ May, Mrs. Paddy, and
Wilhelmina, who manage to say
a great many unlikely things to

  

The play, which bears a weari-9
some resemblance to The Silver"

each other, none of it particu-
larly funny.

By GEORGE MEHAFFEY

Pitt’s last hopes for an unde-
feated football team will go with

the Frosh-JV squad to Annapolis

on Saturday afternoon.

The Jungle Cubs meet the Navy
Plebes in the ﬁrst and possibly the
toughest game of their four game
schedule, which alsoincludes tilts
with JV’s from Ohio State and
West Virginia and a Frosh-Only
encounter with Kiski.

The combined eleven began its
final week of preparation by play-
ing a full scale game with the sec-
ond and third string varsity, who
were led by All—City quarterback
Henry Ford. Although the Cubs-
lost, 20-0, they showed enough in
spots to promise a busy afternoon

_ for the Middies.

To Use Two Platoon

Coach Ernie Hefferle is still in
the experimental stage, but he will
deﬁnitely ﬁeld a two platoon team
against Navy with a few gridders
seeing action both on offense and
defense. These double-duty men
are tackle Bob (Dutch) Nesbit,
guards Hal Hunter and Jim Croyle
and tackle Joe McCabe.

In the offensive lineup Bob Bal-
lock of Farrell has moved into the
ﬁrst string pivotman position and
latecomer Dick Swanson of Mt.
Lebanon is running at left end.

Har-Brack’s Rudy Mattioli ap-
parently has the inside track at
quarterback and will head a back-
ﬁeld that includes Jack Jacobs and
Whitey Mikanik at halfback and
Bill Hoffman at fullback.

By DON SCHURMAN

Another Pitt coaching’ position‘ has been vacated _with

the announcement today that Bob Artman, assistant athletic"

director and freshman basketball coach, will leave Pitt-—
andthe coaching profession—on October 16. L -=

A better Offer has attracted Artman to accept a position
with the Sales Division of theANational Refractory Company

V’

in New York" City. ,
As yet, the vacated post has not
been filled, although Artman did
give the Athletic Oﬂice a month’s
notice.
-Artman To Scout
Artman’s aﬂiliations with the

University have not been com-
pletely severed ‘however. ’While
in New York, hewill scout east-
er_n teams for Doc Carlson, and he
hopes‘ to be “the welcoming com-
mittee for Doc at the NIT or
NCAA held in Madison Square
Garden in March.” _ _
Artman ﬁrst came to Pitt in
1939, playing basketball for Carl-'
son until 1943. In his senior year,
he captained the hoop team. ‘
"After serving two years as an
aviator in the naval air force,~he
returned to Pitt to work under his
former basketball coach. '
Coach For Two Years
A year later, he left Pitt to work
for the Pittsburgh Athletic Asso-
ciation, but in 1948 he returned
to Pitt where he has been an as-
sistant to Carlson until now.

Fortunately no one was killed. The only casualties

You can’t blame Hamilton. H

‘Majorettes Could Help

three touchdown passes—two from
George Atchison and one from
Cliff Hargest—the Delts had no
trouble in winning their initial

The other Delt TD covered 48
yards on ‘a pass play from Atchison
