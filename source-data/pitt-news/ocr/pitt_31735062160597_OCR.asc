Duquesne Students Send
Letter Of Apology To SC

President Phil Parkinson,

Col. ’58, read a letter of apol-

ogy from the Student Government Association of Duquesne
University at Monday’s Student Congress meeting.

As the official voice of the Student Body of Duquesne it
extended apologies for “the poor sportsmanship shown by
some of its students during the Steel Bowl games.”

After admonishing cheerlead- 9

tlemanly conduct during the
games” it “regrets this blow
which our inter-school relations
have suffered, and hopes to re-

plaining Pitt’s offerings, services
and advantages to the various
high schools may apply to the
board members.

The purpose of this calendar is
to provide an essential centralized
record of major University events
that are of interest to the admini-
stration, faculty and students. _

Maintaining this record will
avoid the scheduling of any events
that will conflict with those that
should receive precedence,’ ac-
cording to the statement of policy
circulated by Dr. Peake.

All students applications for
calendar entry will be screened.
Only major events can be record-
ed in the Events Master Calendar,
as the record will be known.

Students will make applica-
tions at the Offices of the Dean
of Men, Dean of Women, Chap-
lain, or Student Union. If the
advisor in any of these oﬁices
considers .the event major in
character, the student will be
responsible for contacting Dr.
J. G. Quick to determine
whether the proposed date con-
ﬂicts with any previously re-
corded event. .

If there is already an event on
the calendar which has been
given “protected” status, applica-
tion for another date will be ad-
vised. -

Health School Tests
Hearing Of Children

In conjunction with a study of hearing in children, ap-
proximately 5,000 children from three to 15 years of age are
slated to have their hearing tested twice a year,

This initial project, conducted by the University of Pitts-
burgh Graduate School of Public Health and sponsored by
the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngol-

ogy through its Subcommittee oné

Hearing of Children, will begin
the tests in 1958 and continue over
a period of three or four years.

Testing will be conducted in
specially built double-walled
audiometric rooms located infour
Pittsburgh public schools; H. C.
Frick, Arsenal, Linden and Knox-
ville.

Parents Request Tests

According to Dr. Eldron L.
Eagles, executive director of the
program, 3,000 of the children to
be examined will come from these
schools by request of their par-
ents.

The other 2,000 children, be-
tween three and five years of
age, will be referred from nur-
sery schools and child health
conferences‘ located near the
schools.

Medical histories »'will be obtain-
ed on all of the children, their
thresholds of hearing will be de-
termined twice yearly, and the
ﬁndings will be checked,otologic-
ally.

More Study to Follow

Based upon these ﬁndings, a
sub-sample of children will be
chosen for more intensive study
and will have their hearing tested
an additional two times per year.

The study is being conducted
to develop efficient and econom-
ical methods for the testing of
hearing in children; to identify
early medical signs and symp-
tons which may indicate a dan-
ger of hearing impairment; and
to measure the psychological,
social, and other eﬁects of such
an impairment.

The Pittsburgh study will also
be used to develop methods and
procedures to investigate groups

Student Appointed

Business Director

Of Tigers Affiliate
By JOSEPH UNGAR
“Baseball is‘ the [truest
American sport; it is the
common denominator for all
of us.”
Tony Pace, a Pitt student,

voices this idea as more than
a passing observation

’ Pace not only feels deeply about

the game, but is officially asso-
ciated with—it. He was recently
appointed Business Manager of
the Charleston, West Virginia
baseball club, a Detroit Tiger af-
ﬁliate.

Wanted Sports Career
Pace’s earliest ambition was to
someday be a professional athlete.
Gradually, he felt himself leaning
tow-ard one sport — baseball.
“Naturally I was disappoint-
ed when I realized I didn’t have
it,” he says, speaking of the
period when he decided that he
would never be good enough to
play big-league ball.
In spite of his disappointment,
Pace did not forget about becom-

. ing part of the game. “I began

looking for a back door,”
Chose Broadcasting

“I thought maybe I could gain
an association with baseball in
some other way,” he said, “pos-
sibly through radio as a sports-
caster. I planned on trying to en—
ter this field.” "

‘While in high school, Pace
visited officials at the area
radio stations, told them of his
hopes, and heard their negative
replies. His voice was too light.

During one of these trips, how- i

ever, he became friendly with Joe
Tucker, local sports announcer.
This was the ﬁrst step toward

-Pace’s present position.

Statistics Needed .
In 1951 he started night classes

CON,GRA’I‘ULATIONS——-Tony Pace, Pitt student-who was recently
appointed Business Manager of the Charleston, West Virginia base-
ball club, is congratulated by his close friend, Branch Rickey, Jr.
in the latter’s office. Tony assumes his new duties after the Janu-

ary graduation. -

at Pitt. “Iwas talking with Tuck-
er one day,” Pace asys, “when he
menti.oned something about the
lack of adequate statistics held by
sportscasters. I had an idea. I de-
cided to compile a record of the
performance of every National
League pitcher.”

‘Pace started his project im-
mediately. Using for his source
old copies of “The Sporting
News,” (some of which he had

to buy from a collector in Cali- '

fornia) he completed the listing
in time for the ’52 season.

The record included such things
as the number of times each pitch-
er had appeared, whether he had
started or relieved, the name of
the opposing pitcher, the date,
locality, and time of the game,
the number of innings pitched,

runs scored, earned runs scored,

strikeouts, walks, and the ﬁnal
score.

Tucker Thankful

Tucker, thankful for such are-
cord, gave Pace a job as his sta-
tistician. This proved to be a big
break. The job entailed spending
much time at Forbes Field, and it
was here that Pace met the people

who helped him decide on at
future.

Pie Traynor, the “irate scout;

’ Harold Roettger, assistant to the

general manager; Jack Berger,
publicity director; Bill Turner,
assistant farm manager, and
Branch Rickey Jr. were there.
They all urged him to try get-
ting into baseball itself.

Berger and Rickey Jr. however.
took a particular interest in Tony.
And one day Rickey Jr. suggest-
ed he try to get into the adminis-
trative cnd of the game.

Army Calls

Shortly afterwards, Pace enter-
ed the army, where he served
until early 1955. When he return-
ed he found that although his old
job with Tucker had been ﬁlled,
he was still welcome at Forbes

~Ficld.

So after starting back to
schooltand taking a job with
Ray Scott, another sportscaster,
he resumed his visits to the ball
park in order to learn more
about the mechanics of baseball.
Last November Pace attended
a three-week session in baseball
administration at Florida South-
ern College. “It is a course held

once a year and taught by ex-—

Annual Meet Covered

Following this course, he flew
to the baseball convention at
Colorado Springs where all clubs
meet annually to air problems and
look for personnel. Here he found
that several clubs had heard of
him through the Florida College
and ‘wanted him to join their or-
ganizations.

However, they all wanted him
to join with the condition that
he immediately assume his dut-
ies. Such action would have
meant dropping out of school
without a degree. .

Then Hillman Lyons, the repre-
sentative from Charleston, agreed
to let him sign as business man-
ager and ﬁnish his schooling. He
signed.

Pace will get his degree next
month. He will then take over his
new job.

Trimester Trial’

A trimester plan has been proposed for fall of this year
by the University administration. Under this plan full-
time classes will be in session for eleven months out of the
year. " A
' In a national broadcast early last year, the Chancellor
announced the feasibility of’ such a plan.'He expressed a
prophetic anxiety for the state of American higher educa-
tion which permits mature, voluntary seekers of knowledge
to be treated like high school and grade school children in
their academic program. .

This plan was announced by Pitt not as a method for
obtaining national acclaim or recognition although this is a
noble enough motive, it was proposed as an answer to this
country’s not—good-enough “system of education.

Students will now have the opportunity to secure ad-
vanced degrees without the burdens of impending draft,
need for job security and the possible conditions of a family.

They will be.,given this opportunity with no increase in
the tempo of their undergraduate studies, No compression
of the terms will take place. No speedup of courses will oc-

'r 19:»:

  

  

A

.cur. The only change will be in the calendar of terms.

Pitt is leading t.he way in a national trend toward this
type of trimester plan. Many schools already have under-
taken quarterly or trimester programs. More schools have
taken the plan under serious advisement after the Pitt pro-
posal and the sputnik launchings of the USSR and the re-
sultant scholastic stampede. ‘

If this program cannot overcome the relatively minor
contemporary objections of the provincial among us, then it
will be "a severe condemnation not of the administration,
which has shown an awareness of the greater problem, but
of an American student body which has not seen past its
own nose. _ ’

Of course there will be complaints about the program
and many stumblings and gropings about will be evident

as it -bears its weight upon the institutionalized and stero-

typed programs of the University.

It is the duty of this paper to register these complaints:

and to illuminate the mistakes and trouble spots in the pro-
gram. .
It is important for all concerned with this program to
be open—minded and fair in its coming trial.

However, this time as he pauses, in the post of
a modern Janus, the college student may find that
the events of 1957 may dictate a radical change in
his attitude for 1958, even in his attitude for years
to come.
Student Gained Popularity

The “typical” college undergraduate became
something of a celebrity during the year just past.
His parents no longer were the only ones who
wanted to know what he was like. Newspapers
and national magazines began to poke around at
the college man and enlisted the aid of his pro-
fessors to document the strange case. At least two
periodicals came up with rather startlingly similar
conclusions.

They found that the 1957 undergraduate was
a good student, not a deep thinker, but ,a respon-
sible person in respect to his education. He tended
to be conservative in his habits: disinterested in

politics, cool toward world affairs, apathetic to-

ward new causes and rebellious fads. l\/laterial so-
curity became an attainable standard for which to

The Quiet Man-Joe College

(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the first of a series
of columns by David Breakstone on contemporary
education in all areas at Pitt.)

By David Breolcstone»
The College Student stands on, the outcropping

Somehow, a wife, a substantial job with Con-
solidated Corporation, and an apartment on U
Avenue was a more meaningful goal after gradu-
ation than continued work toward a Ph.D. or a
professional career. The student rarely read the
classics, but thought of J. D. Salinger, William
Faulkner, and Dylan Thomas, as men to be ad-
mired, it_' not always heeded.

Situation Required Silence

Finally, and signiﬁcantly, the undergraduate

—-was a silent part of the fabled American Scene.

He didn’t criticize publicly a raise in his tuition;
he didn’t scream his lungs out at the football
games; he didn’t argue about the tactics of Messrs.
Eisenhower and Dulles in the international chess
of power politics. ‘

He watched, but not being able to do a great
deal as a participant, not feeling able to cope“ with
the situation, he smiled and went wordlessly about
his “own business. ,

The pundits in the press concluded that the
1957 College Student was a secure individual——
economically, socially, and especially politically.
He was an egotistical man inclined toward ma-
terial standards. He stood as a quiet observer of
a pattern into which he would nicely, inevitably,
ﬁt himself. .

Collegian Reflected Common View

There were few dissenting opinions following
these articles because most of the college popula-
tion knewwthat this was as fair an approximation of
a college type as any generalized appraisal could
be. Even intellectual exceptions to the rule were
reserved and kept any wise retorts to themselves.

The security ofthe United States’ position as,
the premier world power was tabbed as the reason‘

behind the collegiate attitude. Life and its prob-
lems had faded into the bland backdrop of a na-
tion blithely riding the crest of an eternally rising
wave.

Succinctly, this was the best of all possible
times in the best of all possible worlds, and the
collegian merelyreﬂected this prevalent view. The
situation was altered rather dramatically in the
late fall and the thinking of an entire country and

 

work.

Method ’ To Their Madness Or . . .

By Millard Amdur
The trimester plan has much
to its credit as far as its general
worth as a plan is concerned.
However, certain aspects of the
method have

implementation
caused dissen-
s i o n a m o n g‘
many members
of the Univers-
ity family.

T h e f u r o r
which has re-
sulted in ele-
ments of the
f a c u 1 t y and
student b o d y ,
deserves airing
in t h e Pitt

News as the voice of the Uni-

versity. Whether their fears have
any foundation is unimportant
to their case. Only time will
divulge this linformation.

In the inaugural address, the

Chancellor introduced the pro-

posal and, more than this, scoff-
ed at any disadvantages pos-
sibly inherent.

Quoting from his speech,
which received wide coverage
nationally and was printed in
Pitt, Magazine‘ of Fact and
Thought, “I am mindful of but
unimpressed with the possible
objections to such a plan.”

This quarterly publication has
been discontinued to the chagrin
of many alumni, students, fac-
ulty, and friends of the Univers-
ity.

The chancellor continues with

 

a few disadvantages which he
refutes, e.g. learning—f a t i g u e,
summer employment. What then.
some University parties ask, is
the significance of the booklet
sent to faculty members for
“thoughtful consideration and
constructive response?”

In short, some ask, is there
any chance of the trimester pro-
gram not going into effect? Some
believe the taint of a well-plan-
ned maneuver to be present in
the timing of the release before
a vacation and in the possible
preconceived judgment before
the calendar committee began
its work. . “

Faculty Siomploin ,

Many faculty members, too,
complain of their not having had
a voice in the work of the tri-
mester calendar committee.

Now it might be that the facts
lead incorrectly to the conclu-
sion this is a decision already
made,- good as it may be. But the
emphatic words of the Chancellor
and the committee finding that
the advantages far outweigh the
disadvantages to such a plan
make it appear that the plan
inevitably is going into effect.

Some of the students resent
the implication they claim to see
that they are merely cogs in the
wheels of a great corporation.
The students feel they are mass-
produced under the present sys-
tem with violent accentuation
under the trimester proposals.

They express the opinion that

its students might be altered in the process.

Madness In Their Method

:1 University must at all times-
be in close Contact with the cm-

ployees (faculty), and the pro-

ducts (students) for total co-

operation.

Questions Asked

Speciﬁc questions have arisen
on maintenance of high stand-
ards, admission to' graduate
schools of other universities at

‘younger age, the loan program

for students electing the full tri-
mester program. .

Others have queried how in-
creased budget for scientiﬁc re-
search facilities» on an eleven
month basis would‘ be raised.
Would the activity interests at
the University lose their co-
hesiveness through drop-outs forv
trimesters by the leaders?

Would the Pitt News, for in-‘
stance, be allowed funds to pub-
lish on an eleven month basis?
What would -the effect be on
varsity athletic program at the
University?

Where are the applicants for
the second trimester to come
from? Will these be applicants
deferred admission until this
trimester? Will the responsibili-
ties of student government be
affected by the change?

Half—hearted acceptance of the
trimester program by the mem-
bers of the University Commu-
nity might be the harbinger of
minimized chances of success.

Some concrete positive action on...

the part of the administration
might prevent this occurrence.

Letters To The

Editor, The Pitt News‘

We Pittsburgh folks had a real
treat on TV watching the exhi-
bition at half-time of the Gator-
Bowl game. This made the game
itself more enjoyable. Why can’t
we see and hear more of our
Pitt Band, which is one of the
top bands in the country be-
tween the halves of the Pitt
games? . ”. ’

After watching the Pitt games
and enjoying the first half, they
start telling you about the game
that you have been watching
until it ﬁnally gets monotonous.

They have the Pitt Huddle on
TV, which is enjoyable, especial-
ly the close-ups of the players
that take part in the games. A

New Head Improves
Part-time Placement

Miss Alice Appel, recently appointed supervisor of student
employment with the placement bureau, has stated that
changes are fast occuring in this area of University responsi-

,1

‘C

bility. —

\ “Contrary to popular opinion,” Miss Appel stated, “the
University is very interested in helping its students ﬁnd

gainful employment.” 6

Since assuming her new posi-
tion in November, she has raised
substantially the average mini-
mum hourly wage outside the
University and has worked to
standardize pay scales for students
working within the University.

Many positions must be ﬁlled

A rapidly and in order to ﬁll them,

‘Miss Appel must have an accurate
listing of those students wanting
positions, whether or not they

.have ﬁnancial need.

Students may register at the
Placemento Bureau on the second
Vﬂoor of Schenley Hall.

The Director is seeking cap-

able people in' general rather
than only those who can prove
dire necessity. Each individual
‘who registers will have a per-
sonal interview to determine
qualiﬁcations.

Students required by employers
referring to the Placement Bureau
include chemistry, engineering
students, and pharmacy students.

Desire Listing

It would aid the service to have
listings of all students employed
even though many of them will
not have attained their positions
through the supervisor of student
employment.

The purpose of this record
would not be to “pry” but to have

the record in order to later assist?

In addition, a national sports

Mermen Take Southern Trip;

VMI, NC State Provide Test

The Panther swimmers are hard at Work for two week-
end dual meets away from‘ home against VMI and North
Carolina State. The mermen are not content to rest on their
laurels just because they nipped Maryland 46-40 in the sea-

son’s opener.

The Blue and Gold Tankers placed first in eight of the

ten events‘ with Pat Fitzgerald¢
copping the 220 and 440 yard free-
I .
style events. “I hope the team will
not suffer another losing season
again,” said Coach Ben Grady.

Other victorious Panthers
were Willis Weisz in the back-
stroke, Chuck Nanz in the 440
yard backstroke and Nanz,
Weisz, Gene Adams, and Ken
Cooper in the 440 yard relay.
Don Weber captured the 50-
yard freestyle and Milo Fisher
took diving.

Last year was the first year that
the Panther mermen relinquished
their grasp on the ECSA Trophy
which greeted the Blue and Gold
showcase for ﬁve straight seasons.
The Jungle Cats will be trying
hard to regain the trophy for the
showcase.

“We are anticipating a very
tough season this year but the
team morale is high after the

 

Maryland win, and if it ‘stays that
way I am quite sure we will give
a good accounting of ourselves,”
commented Grady who has been
at Skyscraper U. since 1939.
Coming up from the sopho-
more rank this year are juniors
Ken Cooper, Dale Marpstone,
Lee Engdahl i-n the free style
events; Willis Weisz, August
Mucha in the backstroke; and
Chuck Nanz in the breast
stroke. Pat Fitzgerald represents
the sophomores in the free style;
Two senior lettermen, Lou Dur-
bin and Ed Robson, will give add-
ed strength in thefree style and
backstroke events respectively.
Remaining meets at home,
which will beat the Carnegie
Tech Pool, are with Ohio Uni-
versity, Lehigh, and Rutgers.
Away meets are with Army, Navy,
Syracuse, Miami of Ohio, and two
post season tournaments.

Cymnasts Meet
Orallgemen In
Season Opener

Coach Warren Neiger’s gym-
nasts are busily preparing for
their ﬁrst dual meet of the sea-
son at the Field House on January
18. The opposition will be fur-
nished by the tumblers of Syra-
cuse University.

The squads training program
includes daily practices from 4-6,
and Tuesday and Thursday eve-
ning sessions -in the Field House
proper. “The boys seemt to think
that they can better last season’s
record,” voiced Coach Neiger.

, A ﬁne nucleus of lettermen
are back from last year’s crack
team. The gymnasts posted a
6-3 record in dual meet compe-
tion, ﬁnished third in the East-
ern Finals, and captured ninth
place in the NCAA Tournament
last season. '

Most of the Panthers st_rength
this campaign will center in the
flying _. rings. Tom Darling, last
year’s NCAA champ, along with
‘Dave Hirst and Jack Hammond
will represent the Jungle Cats
this campaign. This trio swept
the Easterns in this event and ap-
pear capable of doing it again.

Hirst, Hammond, and Don
Neeld will anchor the tumblers
while Darling should add more
points on the high ‘or horizontal
bar. Jim Mulvihill, who scored
seven firsts in meets in 1957, will
be the specialist on the high bar.

The best new prospect on the
side horse is Sophomore Don
Kasner. John Cacolice is the
Panther mainstay in the rope
climb. .

John Marcinko, who isn’t elig-
ible until February, will help on
the parallel bars along with Don
Shima. “I also havesome pro-
mising freshmen this season,”
stated Neiger.

IF Athletic Group
To Award Annual
All-Sports Trophy

The Inter Fraternity Athletic
Committee has established an All-
Sports-Trophy which will be
awarded annually to the fratern-
ity having been the most consis-
tent winner in I-15‘ competition.

Jim Luci, I-F Athletic Chair-
man, announced that a “weighted
scoring system” will be used in
awarding points to the ﬁrst, sec-
ond, and third place winners in
each of the three sports divisions.

“All the sports have been
classiﬁed as either Major, Mid-
dle, or Minor sports, with each
class having a separate scoring
system,” said Zuci.

The Major class is comprised of
football, basketball, and softball,
while the Middle class takes in
bowling. soccer, swimming, track,
volleyball, and wrestling.

Squash, tennis, ping pong. golf,
and badminton make up the Minor
sport classiﬁcation.

Luci also brought out the im-
portant fact that any fraternity

secutive years will retain perma-
nent possession.

Wrestlers Seek Second
In Bout Against Terpins

By JIM LACEY
Saturday night’s wrestling meet will bring together two
unbeaten teams when the Panthers and Maryland Terpins

clash at University Park, Md. The Blue and Gold stand at
1-0 besides a victory at Wilkes Tournament. The Terps have

a 2-0 slate.

The men of “Coach Sully Krouse will go ‘into the meet ‘

witha near perfect record in theii$

ﬁrst two meets. The wins came
over Wake Forrest 34-2 and North
Carolina State 33-2.

Ray Osbourne (123) and Ray
Haney (137) have perfect 2-0 rec-
ords while Co-captain Sal Amato
(167) has a win and a draw to his
record. Co-captain Leroy Kennedy
(147) has a 1-0 record along with
Nick Biondi (157) and Joe Dough-
erty (190).

Holiday Win

Coach Rex Peery will send the
same team that defeated Michigan
to face the Terps. Paul Powell
(123), Chuck Moyer (130), Vic
DeFelice (137) and Bob Sentner
(147) will wrestle in the lighter
classes. The heavier weight class-
es will be handled by Bob Rich-
ardson (157), Dave Johnson (167),
Tom Alberts (177), and Alex
Skirpan (heavyweight).

Over the Christmas Holidays
the Wrestlers added to their
laurels by placing ﬁrst in the
Wilkes Tournament on Dec. 27
and 28. They also began their
eleven dual-meet season with a

win over Michigan, 22-6, at Ann
Arbor on Jan. 3.

The Panthers used two firsts by
DeFelice and Johnson and a sec-

ond by Powell to edge by Cornell‘

60-58 to cop the tournament title
for the third year in succession.
DeFelice Has Second Title

Johnson was voted the out-

standing wrestler in the tourney.
He scored a thrilling 2-1 victory
over the 167 pound national
champ and former teammate, Ed
who represented the
Third Army.

DeFelice defeated Tom Grifa
of Rutgers, 5-0, to take the 137
pound title for the second time
in as many tries. Powell took
second place when Dick Auble
of Cornell defeated him by an
8-3 count. »

The\Grapplers completely out-
classed the Wolverines by winning
six of eight matches. Larry Mur-
ray edged Moyer 8-7 and Steve

TOM ALBERTS
Reutrning Veteran

Zervas stopped Alex Shirpan 7-5
for the only Wolverine Victories.

All the other matches were
complete routs for the Panthers.
The top upset was DeFelice’s vic-
tory over Max Pearson, 6-0. The
verdict was a complete surprise
since Pearson was the runner—up
in the Nationals last year.

Sentner pinned Lloyd Hamady
at 4:31 as did Johnson who’down-
ed Jay McMahon. at 4:45. The rest
of the matches proved fairly easy
with Richardson decisioning
Wayne lKing, 3-0, and Albert
swamping Carl Lutomski, 12-2.
Powell also whipped Mike Boyle
8-5.

NCAA Convention Convones;

The Field House offices are
quite empty these days. It appears
this way since all but three of the
Panther coaches are in Philadel-
phia attending the annual NCAA
Convention. This yearly event is
attended by all the coaches if pos-
sible.

Baseball Coach Bobby Lewis
was the ﬁrst member of the Pan-
ther delegation to reach Phila-

delphia- Other Blue and Gold
tutors already on the scene are
Warren Neiger, Ben Grady,
Johnny Michelosen, Steve Petro,
and Jack Wiley.

Athletic Director, Tom Hamil-
ton, also made the journey across
the state as did the Panther’s
Publicity Director Carrol Cook.

Cook is his busy self as head,

Panthers Lose;
Win Publicity

Sports Editor

The Panthers proved that you do not have towin to
receive a lot of publicity in a basketball tourney. All you
have to do is play sloppy ball, have an All-American can-
didate on the team, and eventually lose the ball game.

The Jungle Cats received more publicity while losing at
the Holiday Festival Tournament than Temple did in win-

ning the tournament. The New York sports writers lived up

to their reputation of being. severe critics as they literally
tore the Blue and Gold apart for such a poor showing.

Sports Illustrated had an article in publication about
the “inept” Panthers before the \tournament“was in its
ﬁnal day of play. In fact, the magazine went on to state,
without Don Hennon the Panthers would have hardly
rated tickets to watch the game.

‘ But the writers did agree on one thing, and that was Pitt
did have a sure-ﬁre All-American on the team in Hennon.

Although Hennon was tabbed as “Gunner” by the writers,_

they all lauded his ﬁne performdnce in the tourney. Much
of the tournament\would have been dull if it had not been
for Hennon’s display of dribbling, passing and shooting.

A few die—hard writers did disagree with the majority
witnessing theO 
against

of experts after
Panthers opening fray
Temple. The Hennon-Guy Rod-
gers dual proved to be a bust so
a few writers tore Hennon apart,
although the Pitt Ace looked;

ing the Temple Flash.

Very little credit was given to i
Jules Pegues who watched Rod— l

Squash Outlook Bright;

Mason Leads Veterans

, By JOHN L. SULLIVAN

The Panther squash team could very well have a losing
season this year, although in the words of coach Ben Pope,
“This is the best material I have ever had.” .

Pope, now in his third year as squash coach, said that th

Panthers are hampered by the limited number of Pitt Stu».

dents who attempt to play the game.

“Whereas a college like Yale‘
has about 1500 students playing
squash annually,” said Pope, “we
have aboiit 15 or 20.” And mili-
tary schools like Navy, he added,
have most of their students play-
ing squash ten months a year.
“With advantages such as these,”
he said, “it is easy to ﬁeld strong
teams year after year."

In Coach Pope’s words, “Dave
Mason,” the runner-up in the Na-
tional Tourney last year, “should
not lose a match.” Don Isaac, Bill
King, Grover Phillippi, and Fred
Bonebrake have been “under ﬁre”

before and should do very well, he
said.

Frosh “Bumper Crop” Out

Although the remaining men on
the squash “ladder” are inexperi-
enced, Pope expects them all to
improve once they begin competi-
tion. Rounding out the nine-man
“ladder” are sophomores ‘Paul
Knouse, Jack Monchick, Ben
Fisher, and Jim Riedtke.

A “bumper crop” of freshmen
have also been practicing daily
since late September with one
meet, Navy, scheduled thus far.

Leading contenders for the ﬁve-
man squad are Bill Hinkel, Laur-
en Guthrie, A1 Catrino, Tom Fry,
Barry Wolk, and Joe Valley.
Rounding out the squad are Bill
Bennett, Jim Doyle, Steve Allison,
and Ed Kelley.

Outcome Rests on Mason

Although-they meet both Yale
and Navy——which is the top rank-
ed squash team in the nation—-—-‘
Coach Pope expects the Panthers
to better last seasons record of
0-4. ' I

This optimism centers around 1
the fact that four senior letter-
men and a sophomore, who was
the runner-up in the 1956-57

me_nt, return to give the
Panthers better balance and
more experience than was evi-
