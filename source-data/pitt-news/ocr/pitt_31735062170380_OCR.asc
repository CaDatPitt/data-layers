Shriver Focuses Speech on Tax Reform

by ROB OBENREDER

R. Sargeant Shriver. Demo-
cratic vice-presidential candidate.
spoke of the party‘s relation to the
people of America in his address
to Allegheny County Democrats
Monday night. “It‘s time we took
stock of where we are." Shriver
said. "An election is all about peo-
ple . . . the people who will serve
and the people they will serve."

Shriver described the difference
between the Democratic and Re-
publican parties as a difference in
the people they serve. He vowed
the Democrats would "do our fav-
ors for the people who get person-
al paychecks, not corporation

firofits.”

Shriver pointed out these con-
stituant differences by citing the
many bills Nixon has vetoed re-
cently: bills for education, child

.development, minimum wage,

health, and public employment.
He accused the Nixon administra-
tion of “cutting back and merely
doing the minimum.”

Sen. Church

Tax reform was a major topic
of address. Shriver stated the
wage-earner pays proportionally
more taxes than any other Amer-
ican. He said McGovern feels this

is wrong. saying. "Money made’

by money should be taxed at the
same rate as money made by
\men.” According to Shriver, the
solution to this injustice lies in
McGovern’s recently disclosed
tax reform program, which Shriv-
er termed “the most comprehen-

sive tax reform program ever

presented . . . looking more like a
president’s message to Congress
‘than a candidate’s proposal."

“The unemployed are not mere-

ly statistics, but human beings,” 1

Shriver stated. “Every man and
woman who wants to work should
have a job. Nixonsays we should
get accustomed to a 5.5 per cent
rate of unemployment . . . the
Democrats say this will never be
acceptable. . . .' If Nixon and Con-
nally think this is acceptable. we
_sh0uld_put them in the ranks of
the unemployed. ”

Campaigns

for Democratic Hopeful

by KARL BALDYS

|  Idaho Senator Frank Church ar-

 

rived on campus Monday to cam-
paign for Senator George McGov-
ern, the Democratic presidential
nominee. First stop was a press
conference with local newsmen
in the Kurtzmann room of the
Student Union.

SENATOR CHURCH
Photo by Jaecks
Question: Are the North Viet-
namese holding out in Paris until
after the presidential elections to
get a better deal from Senator Mc-
Govern?

Church: No, I don't think there's
validity to that. The North Viet-

mese bargaining position has
been the same since the begin-
ning. It hasn't changed  . Presi-
dent Nixon could have agreed to
those terms one month after his
election.

Q.: The polls seem to indicate
that Senator McGovern will have
to pull off some kind of miracle to
win. Is it that critical?

Church: Yes, I think it will take
a kind of -miracle for McGovern
to -win. But. miracles have hap-
pened before. . . . People don’t like
to be computerized and pigeon-
holed and told how to vote.

Church cited‘ “corruption” in
the present administration that

‘\._

, went unnoticed by the public. He

' /

 
   

claimed that “. . . the election is
in danger of being bought,” and
accused Nixon of .avoiding the
campaign issues. Upon hearing
that Democratic voter registra-
tion here at Pitt was running far
ahead of Republican registration,
Church noted that even though the
college campuses were strongly
favoring McGovern,’ the youth
vote, in general, was still in
doubt.

With Jerome Schneewind. Dean
of the College of Arts and Sci-
ences; and William Moorhead.
Democratic Congressman to the
U.S. House, Church left the press
conference and walked across
Forbes Ave. to speak to students
in Common Facilities. Nearly 300
students were on hand in CF 120
to hear the McGovern campaign
speeches.

Congressman Moorhead open-
ed the session with a plea to cut
defense spending and was follow-
ed by Dean Schneewind, who char-
acterized the Vietnam war as “. . .
a war which I believe most de-
cent people should be ashamed
of.” He also revealed his support

for Senator McGovern _and intro-,

duced Senator Church as co-au-
thor of the Cooper Church end-the-
war Amendment saying, “There
are few people more qualified to
talk about the war and what needs
to be done about it than Senator
Church.”

Church blasted Nixon for adding
$75 million to the national debt.
for invoking wage and price con-
trols that he eschewed during the
'68 campaign, and for the high
rate of unemployment. Consider-
ing Nixon’s claims to internation-
al peacemaker Church said. "I
applauded Mr. Nixon when he
went to Peking and when he went
to Moscow. But I’m not impress-
ed withchis promises of peace. as
long as he continues to wage war.
I‘m much more impressed with
what he had to say four years ago.
on ,Oct. 9. 1968. when he said.

Shriver alluded to Nixon’s poli-
cies as a “shell game in which
you can’t tell where the pea is . . .
the pea is right in your eye.” As
an illustration, he mentioned Nix-
on’s use of the phrase, “Reduce
the rate of increase of crime.”
Crime has still increased, despite
Nixon’s promises to reduce it.”

Referring to the Vietnam war.
Shriver .described Nixon as "the
only President that has never had
a day of peace during his entire
administration.” Commenting on
the troop withdrawals. bombing
escalation, and Vietnamization.
Shriver stated, "You are not go-
ing to say the war is over because
the people getting killed are
brown instead of white." refer-

"Our party has always been
open to all people.“ Shriver stat-
ed. He mentioned that all Blacks.
-Italian-Americans, Polish-Amer-
icans, Greek and Japanese-Amer-
icans in elected office are Demo-
crats. "These statistics are not
accidents," he said. “Our party
has traditionally been open to all
people trying to move up the eco-
nomic and socialladder of the
country.” -

Shriver concluded by stating,
“The Democratic party always
has been and will continue to be
the party of the American peo-
ple.” '

e Force

on WPGH “Livewire" T alkshow

by JIM RETHI

According to Joseph Gil, super-
intendent of University Police. a
student can be arrested by a Uni-
versity policeman in his dorm
room if he is either observed us-
ing illegal drugs, including mari-
juana. or if a University police-
man enters astudents room with
a legal search warrant and finds
illegal drugs there.

Gil talked about this and other
issues on WPGH “Livewire" pro-
gram Monday night. He describ-
ed the University Police force of
72 officers, a staff of sergeants
and administrators. and.20 stu-
dent aides as a "private police
force commission under the non-
profit corporation act.”

This type of commission, Gil ex-
plained, gives the University Po-
lice “full police power on the
campus and in the adjacent com-
munity.”

Asked about the type of training
University policemen receive. Gil
replied that the officers are train-
ed in general by the State Police.
by the Pittsburgh Police in fire-
arms handling. and by the Red
Cross in first aid. All applicants
for a position on the force, Gil
said, are screened as to personal-
ity and background. ’

In response to a question about
the rise in bicycle thefts, Gil stat-
ed that his department has found
that-bicycle theives “usually op-
erate in organized groups of two
or three.” He spoke of a new de-
vice which may deter bicycle
stealing on campus—a lock and
cable system with a burglary
alarm that goes off when the sys-
tem is tampered with. '

He added that the Valuables
Registration System begun this

‘ fall can be a help in recovering‘

stolen articles, but that it is “hard
to measure the deterrent effect”

of such systems. Gil noted that ‘ W

students can still‘ register val-
uables with the University Police.

During the one hour question-P ..
and answer period, many callers . 
had questions about the number of ’ "
University Police officers sus-_
pended during the _course of aﬂ

year. ‘Although Gil said that he\

Faculty Club Awarded“

State Liquor License

by LOIS ELDER

The University's Faculty Club.
a dining facility open to faculty
and staff and located on the 17th
floor of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. has received its liquor li-
cense. now making it possible for
beer and mixed drinks to be sold
and consumed there.

According to Leland Deck. Uni-
versity Risk Manager and Treas-
urer of the Faculty Club. "The bar
is nearly finished and can be oper-
ational within one _day. We have"
Budweiser and Michelob on tap
for‘ 25c and 30c. respectively.
Mixed drinks will range from 75(-
to $1."

buffet style, and carry~them to
the lounge if they want to have a
drink. Drinks can be bought and
consumed only in the lounge.

Deck said, “The Faculty Club
is limited in its service to the Uni-

versity by its small space. The‘

lounge has 84 seats and is rather
small to accommodate the 2,200
members of the Faculty Club. The
dining room seats 150 and at 12
noon everyday there’s a line of
about 20 members waiting for a
seat.

Because ’the sprinkler system‘ -

mops and anything that would col-_
lect the water which was seeping

through the ceilings and down the  A

stairwells.

"I woke up from the sulpher
smell.” said Chuck Johnston of
the 17th floor. His roommate,
Keith Smith also awoke from the
smell. but thought the odor was
coming from a party that had been
going on earlier that night.‘

"Fire trucks responded to the
heat and smoke, but the thing I
want to know,” Johnston contin-
ued, “is why didn‘t the fire alarm
sound after the sprinkler system
went off, to tell us about the fire?"

Editor's Note: The sprinkler sys- I

tem and fire alarm work indepen-
dently, the sprinkler system is ac-
tivated by heat, the fire alarm must
be pulled.

About three inches of water cov-,

number of reasons, room'1611 was

he "can show a rise in crime at
the University. it is in part a re-
sult of more reporting of crime."
In response to a question con-
cerning the jurisdiction of other

police forces in the University _

community,'Gil stated, “Any law
enforcement agency in a political
subdivision has authority in that
subdivision’? He went on to ex-
plain that this means that the

are “reasonably satisfied with the

“We also hope a new-one will

est and best university in Ameri-
ca that doesn’t have a conference

“You can't have a conference

The lounge will be open from 10

Deterioration and Desication Hoped to be Thwarted A

Nebolsine Pushes Art Preservation  

by MIKE MILLER

Plans for a "floating program"
of environmental studies in the
College which would coordinate
all programs involved with envir-
onmental protection are being for-
mulated. according to Dr. Arcadi
.\'ebolsine. an associateprofessor
of Slavic languages.

Dr. ~Nebolsine's concept en-
"total environmen-
tal program" which includes pro-
tection of landscape. architecture
and art treasures as well as con-
servation of natural resources.

The program proposal coincides

with a presentation by the Italian
Art and Landscape Foundation,
focusing on the destruction of art
treasures in Florence, Venice,
and other art cities.

"It is not simply an exhibition
of photographs and slides but an
exhibition of public education."
said Nebolsine. The thrust of the
program is “to preserve the fu-
ture integrity of art and the bean-
ty of landscape. We're talking
about whether these things are go-
ing to survive or not." he said.

Italy was used as a case study
to point out the deterioration and

desecration of art. architecture.
and landscape all over the world.

Nebolsine views ‘the “floating
program” as one step toward
curbing the deterioration of artis-
tic masterpieces.

"This is a catastrophe." he
said. "and the University should

respond energetically."

He feels that there are many
specialists in fields related to art
and art history who find them-
selves over qualified and unem-
ployed. Concerns for art treas-
urers can create a demand for the
services of such people. "They

their room looked like someone’
had soaked it with a garden hose.
Water not only seeped in from
the ceiling, but also under the
door. '

“A number of my books are
ruined; I’ve tried drying them
out. but they‘ll never be the same.
The television got wet, as did the
stereo. and the water even seeped
through the desk top into the
drawers." Howard said.

"I‘m trying to let the stereo dry
out." Kilson said. "If that works
there will be no problems."

“Everything got soaked, but
nothing, as of yet, was complete-
ly ruined,” Howard added.

Both men praised the students
and the RAs on their respective
floors who helped them clean up.
"It was just one of those unfortu-

nate things—maybe in the future
they can develop an automatic off
for the sprinkling system and a
few more drains that work and will
carr_v the water.“ ‘

Only two drains were unstopped
on the 16th floor. both in the men‘s
room. which is also the highest
area.

The University Housing con-
tract states that the University
can be prosecuted for negligence
on their part. The sprinkler valve
was turned off as quickly as pos-
sible by the authorities, but this
was not quickly enough to stop
flooding.

Some of those involved have
talked of taking the case to the
Legal Awareness Committee for
action. ‘

Director of Housing John Vrana

said that he has not received an
official report of the damage yet
and no students have reported
personal damage to him. "There
have been similar situations in
the past and after all. it's a safety
feature to stop afire.“ he said.

can take their knowledge out of

 

their books and apply it in a more _

Many of the art objects Nebol 1 .

sine refers to will only be able  

to survive if the public becomes
actively concerned for their pre-
servation. These include castles,
fortresses and buildings such as
the Roman Colleseum which are

Programming Pitt—Fa| s

The Student Government Board's plan to bring Norman

A Mailer to campus for an Oct. 31 speaking engagement was near-
ly thwarted recently by the Allocations Committee. The Com-

mittee refused to fund the proposed program, so that negotia-

_ tions with Mailer were delayed for two weeks.

The Allocations Committee did not object to the appearance
of Mailer on the grounds that he was undesirable or ‘uninterest-
ing, but because they feared that there would not be adequate
time to publicize the speech. Perhaps their fears were well
founded.

Members of the Allocations Committee contend that much

of this year's ‘Student Government programming has been_fly-I
. by-night and that insufficient time has been spent on prepara-

tion.

The fact that the Board had to give away the tickets for their
rock concert last month and that they were unable to utilize the
funds granted them to bring Bernadette Devlin to campus re-
cently justifies the Committees concern.

The Allocations Committee told the Board in refusing the

 funds for Mailer that they should begin work on their programs

earlier andbe better prepared before asking for money.
Members of the Student Government Board feel that the A1-

A- locations Committee is punishing them for their recent failures.
_ . They may be right. ’

We believe that the Mailer program could have been suc-

 cessful if the Board was permitted to begin workvon it when the
" request was initially submitted two weeks ago. Mailer is such
- a controversial figure that it is hard tobelieve campus publicity
. would be a problem. Instead the entire matter was delayed by
_ misunderstandings and confusion between the two organizations.

Members of the Board maintain that theynever received a

written refusal of their original request. The Allocations Com-
7 mittee claims that they were never asked to reconsider their de-

cision in writing. .

$64 Million Question

By JOHN METCALFE
Several people. mostly from the less sophisti-
cated suburbs and even remoter regions of the
world. have expressed puzzlement about the uni-

formed ladies who patrol the campus area. They .

imagine that these ladies are crossing guards

‘provided by the city as an alternativeto actually

marking the crosswalks. A .
Those who hold this curious belief are general-

'ly new to the city. They have been seduced by

the curious ambiance of ‘Pittsburgh. Just because
it combines the amiable inefficiency of small-
town government with all the smells and dangers
of a great metropolis, they expect either the. per-
sonal concern for human welfare so often found
in villages, or. failing that. the efficiency of an
industrial capital._
They are doomed to disappointment.

Those uniformed females are meter-maids.
This term is a title rather than a description; some
of them may have left the maiden state some
time ago.

I do not rise early or easily; I have adjust-
ed my life and my class schedule around this
minor failing. As a result. given the bus service
available and the exigencies of time. I sometimes
drive to school.

I should be ashamed of that admission. and I
am. I can only plead the lack of viable alterna-
tives.

Whatever the merits ofymy case. I generally
arrive in the campus area after all the good park-
ing spaces have been taken by driveways and bus
stops. .

Sometimes I drive because I don't have bus
fare, through some oversight. So the metered spa-
cess are no help. An odd hegira follows: up and
down the same streets, waiting for someone to
pull out of the solidly parked ranks; noting for
future reference those vehicles straddling the lim-
its of possibility and managing to occupy two
spaces. This is exhilerating; it would be a
sport if a fellow could relax and ignore the lee-
ture or quiz he’s missing. Like death, success

.-comes eventually — through unpredictably — and

the day can begin.

But- the meter maids also give food for thought
on these ‘everlasting cruising journeys up and
down the dreary back streets of South Oakland.
They seem a luxury a crumbling city can scarce
afford. even though they probably make less than
policemen, or any uniformed male employees of
the city. . *

But they are worth it; indeed they are un-
doubtably worth a great deal more'than they
earn. for they are the guardians of the most val-
uable land in the world.

There are citizens of this great land of ours_
who receive enormous sums for not growing cot-
ton. A few grow rich by promising not to grow
wheat; and a few millions are reaped by those

who choose not to sow soybeans. But these are
nothing.

Within daily view of each of us, so familiar
we rarely notice it, is land which yields an in-
come of 64 million dollars per square mile every
year. ’

And this is the land the meter maids guard.

Now I digress. _

A" great American recently perished. but he
left his mark. He was a certain Mr. Duncan. and
he invented the yoyo. If we do not all remember
"it. it will surely be back soon to remind us; this
form of madness is a hardy perennial. -

In addition. he graced the world with the
parking meter. The original purpose of this de-
vice was to make Chambers of Commerce pros-
perous. and thus happy. They were to discour-
age" all-day parking in congested business districts
by imposing a nuisance fee. Thus, more shoppers
per da_v could use the limited space —_— presuma-
bly each of them would spend a gratifying
amount of money. -

Mr. Duncan is undoubtably whirling in his
grave. if not positively "walking the dog”. ‘

He missed one of the greatest money-makers
of all time — if he could only get royalties . . .
end of digression.

Parking spaces around campus average eight “

to nine feet wide and about twenty-two feet long.
For a rough figure I consider them to average
two hundred square feet. For another rough
figure, I consider an acre to be about forty thou-
sand square feet, though it is a bit more. Thus,
for my purposes, I will require two hundred park-
ing spaces to make an acre, though the actual
figure is a bit higher.

Fine. Each parking space is decorated with a
meter. Some times the meters are doubled up on

'a single pole every other parking space. Near the

campus, the meters take ten cents for thirty
minutes. or twenty cents per hour. Some are col-
lecting thirteen hours a day (8 A.M. to 9 P.lVI.).
but I‘ll assume an average of ten hours daily.
This translates to two dollar-s per day per

space. Assuming five day a week operation (though
six is more likely), we get ten dollars a week. or

about five hundred dollars per year per space.g_~,_

At two hundred spaces per acre, that's about one
hundred thousand dollars a year per acre of on
street parking.

There are six hundred and forty acres in a
square mile (gratuitous information of the week).
Ready‘? . ’

Every square mile of city property cut into
parking stalls represents sixty-four million dollars
a year in income.

Think of that next time you're tempted to
sneer at a meter maid.-She knows what respon-
sibility is. -

Surely wecould all manage at least a cheery
"Good morning. Rita!"

Chauvinist Pigs?

by GEORGE ZRUST
In the recent rush to
"liberate" various oppressed

groups. one prominent group in
our society has been left out-
animals. Yes. animals. The more
you think about them. the more
you realize how much they need
to be liberated.

Animals have been particularly
stifled in the expression of
their cultures. Literature is a ma-
jor villain. for here humans long
have forced their own values
and customs on animals. Look at
comic books. Instead of speaking
their native tongues. the animals

_speak the English imposed on

them by human chauvinist car-
toonists. Many cartoon animals
walk erect like humans. and have

their front paws replaced by
four-fingered human hands.
Worst of all. the animals act
like humans. sly and under-

handed. or wise and philosophi-
cal.-In light of this. government
and universities must allot funds
for complete animal libraries.
with books that will combat the
distortions of present animal
literature.

‘Animals are also forced to

conform to dress codes set by
humans. Fortunately, this is not
too widespread, but many dogs
still have to wear “booties” and
sweaters in the winter. And what
about comic book animals that

wear sailor suits or aviator out-
fits? Or the number of horse who
wear unnatural-looking saddles
and harnesses? All of this sup-
presses the native dress customs
of animals. Horses might want to

DATES FOR FRESHMEN~—SOPHOMORE
WINTER REGISTRATION GROUP SESSIONS

By MONICA CIROCCO

With the winter term approach-
ing. students should begin to
make tentative class schedules.
New course catalogues are now

available at three major loca-

tions: the Admissions Office. 6th
floor S.U., the Information Desk
1st floor C.L., and the CAS Ad-
vising Center, 9th floor C.L.

Seniors will begin to register
with their departments October
16 and juniors will start on the
23. In addition, 79 regional cam-
pus students register the 19th. ‘

Juniors and seniors "should - con-
tact their major departments right
away for appointments. Sopho-
mores and freshmen register on
the 30th, however they will meet
prior to this date with their ad-
visers. Appointments will be
made, by lottery, only at the ad-
viser group sessions to be held the
week of October 16-20.

dramatize the whole situation by

imitating the women, and burn-
ing their harnesses.

The verbal abuse that animals
must endure is incredible. The
term "horsepower" is a prime
example. because it exploits the
horse as a mere "work object."
When a male sexist calls a wo-
man a "pig." he is abusing a
very intelligent group of animals.
And the’ disgusting practice ‘of
calling a coward "chicken" is
for the birds.

Birds are victims. too. of some
very symbolic humane violence.

For many critics, the films of Federico Fellini's early period,
are still his best. John Simon, for example, has called
I VITELLONI ”a great masterpiece, one of the ten or welve
great films ever made.” ”Vitelloni” are literally fatted '
calves; he term is used .here to describe the overgrown
youths who drift aimlessly with no purpose in life. Fellini's
film is an intricate examination of five vitelloni,- all are
about 30, but hey still run wild and piiifullillusions about
the future. The leader, Fausfo (Franco Fabrizi), is a carefree, .
handsome playboy; Alberto (Alberto Sordi) is a clownish,
affected man who dreams of easy fortune, travel and
women; Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste) dreams of becoming
a poet; Riccardo (Ricardo Fellini, aspires to fame as a
singer; ad Moraldo (Franco lnterlenghi), s a sensitive, shy

I C Golden Umbrella

by VINCE Di NARDO

J H Sports Editor

_ ' Regretfully. it hasn‘t exactly been raining victoriesin Pitts
'th_l_'etic_$ complexes the last few _vears. Nevertheless. there are
‘group of unselfish. self sacrificing men who have lived and
_no”stly died with past Pitt athletics. These men would be the
Pitt Golden Panthers.

, "These men remember Pitt's glory days. They were a part of
lose days and they are willing to give_ their time and money to
ssure a return to them.

‘“I_f. you are notfamiliar with this group. its not.your fault.
~Tntil August. 1970. this group was known by three different
ia_mé's. They were known as the Pitt Varsity Letterman‘s Club.
'-‘lie Bellefield Educational Fund (Panther Foundation». and the
"'owli’ng Panthers. originated after Dave Hart became head
acfh, . z

, _‘,‘*I't took our athletic director (Casmir Myslinski) two years
“put us all under one umbrella,” said Robert Miller, current
resident of the Golden Panthers. “The three groups were all
ntertwined and moving in different directions.”

United and numbering over 300, these alumni have already
‘bnejnotable things beneficialto the present Pitt athletes. They
v,e__ obtained-traveling blazers. improved the food at the Pitt
'-rainingtables. and have installed lights at Pitt Stadium.
5'."‘O-ther schools have had these things for years," continued
'ller.*'who~m everybody calls "CR." "I‘m more concerned for
,;'o,ing things for the athletes that we have here today than for the
Es coming. Because if you do that. you will already have done
i;liih‘gs for the future athletes.“ ‘
"Now, CR makes it clear that this is open to the student. To
long to the Golden group a $25 minimum is required to be de-

sited into the Panther. Foundation. But, a Pitt student can now
"‘Ve§-ya ‘member’ and it won’t cost, him any money—not yet anyway.
_“We are not going to solicit students,“ Miller continued.
'i,fiit'_if he comes to us all we want is his time and energy. He
"oesn't have to give us the $25 until after he graduates.

_’''If any student is interested, he should contact us at the
umni Development Office at 3434 Fifth Ave."

Getting back to business at hand. the Golden Panthers are
=pori‘s'oi'ing a parents’ weekend next week. theweek of the Bos-
" College game. The football players parents will be hosted at
r.,un‘ch and then honored at the football game. While the moth-
aije inthe stands, the fathers will be on the field. proudly
airing their sons numbers on their backs. It is the least the
iimnit can do to show their appreciation for the bearers of Pitt‘s
é;sent‘athletes. ‘

_ THE REBOUNDERS

 As is bound to happen in any growing organization. new
jngs are happening to the Golden Panthers. A group of 62 men.
show a definite interest in Pitt basketball have united their
rgts to improve basketball tangibles.

This group. while operating under the framework of the
jfldeun Panthers, has already begun concentration on Pitt bas-
tbalil. Known -as the Rebounders, the group has already begun

Pitt At Stadium Friday

by RON SIEGEL

The only chance to look at some
of Pitt‘s top freshmen will be af-
torded Panther fans when the Pitt
junior varisty plays host to the
Liniversity of Maryland‘s Tera-
pins jayvees on Friday afternoon
at 3 p.m.

The game will be held at Pitt
Stadium and is the only home
game of the year for the Cubs.
There will be no admission charge.

Coaching the Cubs will be Dan
Lynn and Ed Sadowski. the grad-
uate assistants who have worked
with the jayvees all season. as
well as Coach Steve Petro. who
will be on loan from the varsity.
All three coaches were with the
team in their opening season loss
to West Virginia.

The final rosters will not ‘be de-
termined until later in the week,
as injuries to varsity players will
have to be assessed to determine
which players will make the trip
to Notre Dame for depth pur-
poses.

The team will. however. be com-
prised mostly of the players who
made the trip to West Virginia.
Rich Washinko and Don Herold

will probably share the quarter-

backing chores.

The team had little chance to
practice prior to their game with
the baby Mountaineers. and with
the resultant poor timing. suffer-
ed a 17-13 loss.

Coach Lynn is hoping that won’t
happen again. “We hope to be
working out a few days this
week,” he said. “The timing was

pretty bad on the offense and
that's where it matters most.
We’ll be more prepared for Mary-
land.” 9

Lynn is also hoping to add more
plays to the junior varsity game

"plan. but there is a limit to this.

{They can only learn a few new
plays at a time." he notes. "If
you hit them with a lot of plays
they won't learn themwell enough
to execute them."

The University of Maryland ap-
pears to have a strong junior var-
sity team. «Already this year the
young Terapins have defeated
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
the University of Virginia‘s Cav-
ayearlings.

In their season’s openerwith
Virginia, the final score of 21-14
was not indicative of the close-
ness of the game, as the baby
Terps held a vast statistical edge.
Maryland amassed 420 yards in
total offense while holding Vir-
ginia to 256.

Both Virginiascores were set
up by turnovers. including a
blocked punt on their own 40 and
a fumble recovery on the Terapin
14. .. V

In the,VPl game. the opposite
was true. as the Gobblers ran up
a significant statistical edge but
two long touchdowns run by Rich-

ard Jennings (70 and 60 yards).

enabled Maryland coach Dick
Bedding and his charges to es-
cape with a 14-12 win. Jennings
also scored on an 82 yard sprint
in the season opener against Vir-
ginia.

giiiriglisuccess. this group of admil-able men will be behind it HALFBACK Ted Berrien (left) and defensive tackle Theo Lawrence (right)

should be seeing plenty ofgaction against Maryland Friday afternoon. It's
the only Jayvee home game of the season.

yBoolers Fight To Revive Hope

llllllllllllllllllllllIIIIIE

At Pitt Stadium last year Pitt and Akron battled to a 4-4 tie. In
1970, Pitt blew a 2-1 first half lead to wind up on the short end of a

-4-2 score.

Last weekend. in their victory over Air Force. Akron coach Bill
Killen suffered a serious blow to his defensive unit when his premier
fullback was injured. Bimbo Shoyoye sustained a broken leg and will be

lost for the rest of the campaign.

Pitt. on the other hand. returned from Philadelphia without any
serious injuries. Goalie Bill Haines did have to leave the game when he
suffered a cut hand. but returned to the field after receiving minor re-
pairs and will be ready for today‘s game in Ohio.

One interesting note is that the Akron team is composed almost
entirely of foreign-bred players. On the whole squad there are only
three Americans while the majority of the Akron booters hail from
countries such as Nigeria, Jamaica, Italy, Iran and Canada.

Pitt coach Leo Bemis realized the caliber of individual players
Pitt would face when he remarked. "They might be a little more skill-

-ed than we are, but we get right out and go at them from the opening

whistle then we just might surprise them."

"We're going up againstia very. very good team.“ Bemis added.
"But we’re not just going along for the ride.”

If the booters can dispose of_'.Akron. ‘then that two hour trip might
pay off in dividends‘. But if Akron preyails. that dismal ride backxjust

» might extend itself over theremainder of the schegdu-le. _

Fortunately for Pitt, some-
thing happened to Jennings that
everybody who plays in a junior
varsity game hopes for. Jennings’
services have been deemed too
valuable to the varsity and if he
plays in any more junior varsity

Notre Dame’ _; Q 

 

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

, For someone who had relative-
ly little experience with organized
football prior ‘to college. Pitt‘s de-
fensive back Reggie Frye has cer—.
tainly left an impressive mark on
Panther grid action.

Frye. a 6-0. 185 pound senior
from Braddock, Pa., was not
handed a scholarship to attend
Pitt or any other university. He
arrived‘on the Panther scene as_a

A -walk-on_and has gone on to cap- .

ture a starting position on the
squad for the past three years.

PANTHER GRIDDER Reggie Frye grabs a hold of Florida State's Barry Smith,

 

"I wasn't too impressive in
high school football.“ related
Frye. "I only played my senior
year and ‘that only consisted of
four games. . . . Ididn‘t play more
because I had asthma and- my
mother wouldn't let me play.

“She was looking out for my
own welfare—she was afraid I

‘might have an asthma attack,”

he continued. f‘So I forged the
parent consent slip and that’s how

-I finally got to play in high school.”

So. despite his mother and the
fact that he received no football
scholarship. Frye has proved his

 

 

forcing him to drop the football. Frye has been a key player on Pitt's defen-

sive secondary for the past three years.

point—that he could play football ,

and play it well.

"I just wanted to give it a try."
remarked the Panther star. "I
wanted to see how I stood. to see
how things would work out."

During his career at Pitt Frye
has played a key role in the_,Pan-
ther defensive secondary and is at
the present heralded as “one of
the East’s top ‘defensive backs.”

"I‘m satisfied with my perform-
ance at Pitt," explained Frye. "I
wish I could have intercepted

more though. ‘But more impor-‘

tant than intercepting passes. l‘ve
gainedrespect from a lot of the
teams we play.

"I have no expectations about
my performance this year." he
added. "I always try to give my
best. to give all I can give —— my
maximum." ,

Frye is", hoping that his short

. football career will not be short-

lived. Like many other athletes,
the Panther tri_-captain would like
to continue as a professional foot-
ball player. ‘

"I can‘t say that things look
pretty bright." stated Frye. "I
have talent. though. I have speed

see why I can't make it."

Whether or not Frye goes on to
become a professional gridder. he
would still like to continue with
his education.

Frye, a history -major, is hop-
ing to attend a graduate school
for higher education upon his leav-
ing Pitt.

     
    
  

"Either way. whether I play

he said. "If I do play pro footba'll‘~
I‘d still like to go to graduate,
