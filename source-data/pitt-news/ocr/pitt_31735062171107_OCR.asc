The Black Action Society (BAS)-
was recently recognized as an of-
ficial student organization after
agreeing to stipulate that its ac-
tivities are open toall students.
not only blacks.

According to Committee for Stu-
dent Organizations (CS0) by-
laws, no organization may “dis-
criminate on the basis of race, re-
ligion, or national origin." This.
however’, was violated by Article
III of the BAS constitution: "The
membership of BAS shall be open
to all registered black undergrad-
uate students."

After meeting‘ with some CSO

and Student Government Board
(SGB) members, the leadership
of BAS agreed to add a clause to
their by-laws saying that the or-
ganization “does not exclude par-
ticipation from any student upon
this campus so long as their goals
are in accordance with ours.”

The reason the agreement was
made according to SGB member
Sue Ruffner was that "the BAS
has certain needs to fulfill by be-
ing an all black organization.

“We, however. have to make‘

sure that all student organiza-
tions are open to everyone. We

have confidence that the BAS has

not and will not exclude whites
from any of their programs."

Bill -Lowman, BAS’s political ac-
tion committee chairman, sees
the change made in the BAS con-
stitution as “temporary.” He
would like to see a permanent
change made in the by-laws of the
CS0 so that their constitution can
read as it did before the.CSO ques-
tioned them.

"Due to the nature of the BAS."
he said. "our organization can‘t
be opened up to all students."

Lowman added that he had the

"confidence of SGB President Rege

Kaufmann and some other board
members that a change would be

made in the CS0 by-laws within .

the next year.

Kaufmann, however, said that
a change in the CS0 constitution
was only one possible solution,

Library Top Priority

for Capital Fund Drive

by DREW PORVAZNIK

The Capital Fund Drive is being.
carried out by the Development

.and Alumni Affairs office. This‘

fund drive will attempt to raise
$35 million over a 10 year period
for improvements in the Univer-
sity.

Bernard Koperek. a spokesman
for the Alumni Affairs office. ex-
plained that the money raised will
go to the top priorities of the
Capital Fund Drive. The Hillman
Library will receive $2.5 million
for additions to the Library. About
$2.1 is to be allocated to the School
of Law; the School of Business
will get $2 million.

The School of Dental Medicine
will receive $500,000. In addition,
money will be allocated from the
fund drive to the College of Arts
and Sciences and also for scholar-
ships.

Approximately $20 million of
the total $35 million will be used
for the first phase otithe develop-
ment program. The remaining $15
million will be allocated for pro-
jects in the second phase sched-
uled to begin in 1978.

Koperek also stated that there
will be many means used to raise
money for the Capital Fund Drive.
In some instances. the Chancellor
and other University officials

will call on the heads of numerous
corporations, foundations. and
special individuals in order to re-
ceive grants.

In other cases, Koperek said,
the schools of the University will
have their own programs of rais-
ing money, including contacting
their alumni. .

This year. the University re-
ceived $670.000 in corporate
grants compared to $490,000 last
year. Koperek expects this fig-
ure to increase once the fund
drive is in full operation.

Presently. the University's en-
dowment fund is $82 million. This
fund is also expected to increase
as thedrive takes effect. In this
case. the interest earned on the
endowment fund will be placed
into the capital fund.

Frank Carver, another spokes-
man for Development and Alumni
Affairs office, discussed money
raised from alumni. According to
Carver, each year all the schools
at the University contact their»
respectipe alumni for donations,
which can run anywhere from $10
to $10,000.

Carver added that companies
where the alumni now work match
the amount of money given by the
alumni to the University.

Job Sex Discrimination 

by DEBBIE POPP

Cathleen Gentilcore. a Ph.D.
candidate in Foundations of Edu-
cation, has filed grievance with
the Affirmative Action Program

and Equal Employment Opportun-

ities Commission claiming sex
discrimination in job applications
for evening librarian in the Falk
library.

Gentilcore. who for over a year
has worked in Falk library shelv-
ing books. says her inquiries into
an opening at the circulation desk
met with the response that the
“job required a male."

The position at the circulation
desk had been held by a male den-
tal student who was leaving the

Mon Scene For Action Weekend

Citizens C/eon Riverfront

by JOHN AMSON CAPITMAN

An estimated 70 tons of gar-
bage were cleared from the west
bank of the Monongahela River
Saturday. as the main event of an
environmental action weekend
sponsored by Environment: Pitts-
burgh.

The clean-up centered on a two-
mile stretch of the river-front. di-
rectly across from the United
States Steel. Homestead Works. at
the bottom ofBrown‘s Hill Rd.
The site used to be that of a pre-

‘industrial village. Junction Hol-

low. and is now the property of
the B&O Railroad‘.

Approximately 40 people, in-
cluding Pitt faculty and students
from Pitt’s Cultural Environment
Program, collected scattered car
wrecks, beer cans, tires; and
other refuse into a single pile. The
pile of garbage was then removed
by the City’s Department of San-
itation Monday. A

Tom Myers. a spokesman for
Environment: Pittsburgh, said.
“This was a unique effort since
all segments of the community
were involved: citizens. industry.
and public services.

Myers explained that heavy
equipment was provided for the
clean-up by B&O Railroad». Alle-
gheny County. and several pri-
vate firms.’ The Army Reserve

-Convoy iARCOl\') ' Unit 99' also

participated in the clean-up. pro-
viding trucks and manpower.

Dr. Arcadi Nebolsine of the
Cultural Environment Program,
stressed “,the importance of Uni-
versity student and faculty parti-
cipation in real actions like this
one, which, if not more important,
are as important as the formal-
ized verbal constructs of the
classroom.” ~

Another sponsoring group for
the environmental action week-
end was the Homewood-Brushton
Clean-up Coalition. Al Busey. co-
ordinator of that group. pointed to
the "good turn-out as indicative
of the degree to which people are

: 4:. . ’_ _ ;

getting involved in the solutions to
environmental problems."

On Saturday groups were given
a river tour of the major sources
of water pollution on the Monon-
gahela. The tour included the out-
fall sites of U.S. Steel and Jones
and Laughlin.

An Environmental Festjyal was
held Sunday in Frick Park. Fea-
tured were a new film concern-
ing “How Safe Are American Nu-
clear Reactors” and several eco-
logical films by local directors.

Speakers at the festival included
Ernest J. Sternglass of Pitts ra-
diology department. Bernard
Bloom, air pollution control engi-
neer for Allegheny County. and
other local environmentalists.

University. His duties had en- 

tailed overseeing Falk library
from 6 p.m. to its closing time at
ll,p.m. three nights a week.

Gentilcore believes this
closing hour was the basis for the ‘

late ‘

allegations that the job had re-V 

quired a male.

She says she was told, "A male

was preferred because of the job -

dangers at night. During the night 0
not as many people are in the li-
brary and in the streets." She
says she was also told, “Some of
the other women librarians would

not consider working at’ night
‘without a male on duty."

Gentilcore claims a disparity in  

the validity of these allegations

since she had, for several weeks, ' 7

been in charge of the circulation;

desk one night a week. She be- 

lieves this experience strengthen-
ed her qualifications for the job
in question.

Gentilcore feels these security
allegations in determining job

Order No. 11375. n

In accordance with this federal 

order, Pitt maintains an employ- "Vi:

merit policy under which qualified

applications are hired and treated _ ‘A _‘j
during employment without re- " ’

gard to race, sex, religion, or na-
tional origin.

Considering these two premises, 

Gentilcore says, “I cannot ac-

 

cept my femaleness as the reason ' i 

why I am not being hired.” A V

'l‘h‘irteen-Q. the latest pop sound in Pittsburgh. is the victim of a

neighborhood fight in Squirrel Hill.

 

 

The Pacific Broadcasting Corporation (13Q) has built three new I 

radio towers on the property of Duquesne Slag, located in the Swiss-

helm section of the city.

These towers have been erected without the necessary authoriza-

tion. Unfer normal conditions, this error could easily be corrected, ,

but the situation in Swisshelm involves a little more than the new sound _ _-.0.

of 13Q.

Duquesne Slag, the primary dumper of slag for Jonesand Laugh- ‘
l-in and United States Steel Corporations, is engaged in a neighborhood
dispute with the Swisshelm Parks Civic Club. The two are side by side.

Merrian Horacks. secretary of the Swisshelm Civic Club. said.
"We want the area not to be made an objectionable area (as it now isi.
We‘re trying to find out what they are doing about cleaning it up, but

we've been unsuccessful."

As a result of their fight with Duquesne Slag, the Swisshelm Club
is “in the process of fighting the erection of PBC broadcasting towers i
without the necessary city permits. Thirteen-Q is renting land for its
new broadcast towers from Duquesne Slag.

Frank Van Amerigen, attorney for the radio station, says that.
13-Q “shouldn't have any trouble getting those permits." He added that
once the towers are in use. $6.000 will be used in a landscaping pro-

gram for that area. - A

.The Women Concerned for the 7

Unborn Child view their move-
ment as primarilyq civil rights

oriented in their opposition to the

January Supreme Court decision
which legalizedabortion. ‘
According. to Mary Winter. pres-
ident of the three‘__ and one-half
year old anti-bortion league, the
women are concerned because the
rights of so many human beings
are being denied’ because of their
youth. "The unborn need to have
a spokesman." ‘ _' '
"The ‘group is actiivelysseeking
support for’ the Human _ Life
Amendment “ that would guaran-

. will we accept murder as Pitts-

burgh's newest _ million dollar
business.'’. said Winter in refer-
enceto the abortion clinic recent.-
ly*opened downtown.

According. to ' the anti-abortion
group recent statements from au-
thorities in themedical field have
said that aborted babies are being
used as guinea pigs during their

» periods of life after the abortion.

“Animals have the Anti-Vivi-
section Agency and Human So-
ciety to protect‘ them from these
outrages. Someone has to protect

the _rights of ‘the unhorn_,”iWin-'

ter said. “We intend to be that

spokesman and to champion the,

-un'b,orn’soright to life.”

Accordingito Horacks. this is the kind of project her club ‘is re-
questing. ‘ . ‘ i ' '

But a confidential source has said that the ‘Civic Clubrhas asked 0

but that the “change might take
place.”

Saying that the addition to the
BAS consitution was just a clari-
fication of what was already in
practice. but unwritten. Kauf-
mann, stressed that SG wanted to
ensure that all organizations‘ ac-
tivities were open to those who
wanted to participate in them.

Although the BAS still doesn't
allow non-blacks to have voting
powers, Ruffner said that there
“shouldn’t be any problems."

“If the case comes up, how-
ever, that a white person, who
believes in the ideals of the BAS,
wanted and was refused voting
powers, the BAS, CS0, and SGB
will have to deal with it,” she said.

Lowman did not think this was
likely since the BAS “helps any
organization or student that
needs us. regardless of who they
are."

Former BAS Deputy Chairman
Joey Fuller said that "some peo-

that the BAS activities are closed
to whites. they‘re not.“

"It's true that our activities are
geared to interest blacks. but that
certainly does not exclude anyone
from participating." said Low-
man.

that it is far from being a minor
surgical procedure.“ said Winter.

She cited a 1971 speech by Dr.
Donald Hutchinson, chief of the
obstetrics and gynecology depart-
ment at Pitt, in which he stated

that 10 per cent of 1,400 women‘
‘studied suffered some complica-

tions following what was consi-
dered safe and simple abortions
performed at excellent hospitals.

"We are trying to show people.
especially young women in their
first pregnancy, that some long-
range complications such as con-
stant miscarriages and even ster-
ility may very well occur. I think
that they should be aware of these
potential hazzards before making
that final decision."

Women Concerned was also in-

Birthright. an organization dedi-
cated to "helping women accept
the responsibility of new life
through compassion and kind-
nessf‘

“Women’s rights are a primary
part of our organization,” stated
Winter. “At present . . . we are
trying to get insurance compa-
nies to change the policies that
will cover an abortion but not the
costs involved with a pregnancy.
This is definitly discriminating
against the rights of the woman
and her unborn child.”

The groups has not taken any
stand on the subject of contracep-
tives.

"That represents a pre—life cir-
cumstance that is entirely up to

auction at:

>\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

the discretion of an individuals
personal morality." Winter said.
She added that it was ironic that

that was the same stand that
Planned Parenthood took back in
the early sixties. Their pamphlets
stated that “An abortion kills the
life of a baby after it has begun.
Birth control merely postpones
the beginning of life.”

Winter contends that Planned
Parenthood now advocates abor-
tion because mass distribution of
contraceptives never really came
about.

The anti-abortion group held its‘

third annual Celebrate Life inter-
faith service at Trinity Cathedral
last Tuesday following a candle-
light procession past the abortion
clinic on Stanwix St.

This whole effort of Western
man on earth to build and spread

 Western Psychology

acteristic is fear. He is the most
frightenning of all the animals.
and the most frightened, for he
has lost what might be called uni-
versal harmony.

Scholars of the world have long

expounded upon cognitive (think-'

ing) and the emotive (loving) ca-
pacities of man, but the world has,
yet to hear of Western man’s so-
cial and cultural fears. It might
well be that the most important
part of existence is fear itself. . . .
Could intelligence be the mastery
of fear, or is it the ability to
adapt? (Other definitions of in-
telligence are too ambiguous). I
think both are important as they
are the beginnings.

There are flaws in rationalism
(mind) and empirical (body)
foundations, if these methods are
incorporated in the social struc-
ture of a civilization.

‘ Fear of death maintains religi-
gion, science is of the same es-
sence, an attempt to define or
control the unknown.

The industrial society is killing
the spirit of man in the same
manner that the earth is being
polluted to death.

The flaw in western philoso-
phies, which covers everything
from law to religion, is the men-
tal disassociation of mind/body/
spirit, and prevents the ultimate
human meaning . . . wisdom. . . .
Only from universal wisdom can
a civilization evolve. '

There is as of yet no present
nation that can claim having
reahed the ideal of civilization.
only semblances. Under the sur-
face you see controlled chaos.
and conditions that still breed so-
cial deviancy (whatever you per-
ceive it to be!). Deviancy can
be defined as any behavior that
is outside of the established social
norm or value. I’ll have other
comments. (c) 1973.

on Scott

not alter our more fundamental
ties with friends."

It is easy to understand Scott's
point of View by re-reading the
fast sentence with the emphasis
on "more." Restated. it might
sound like this.

“We are negotiating peaceably
with the communists, but we can-
not forget that they hold danger-
ous powers. Let uslremain peace-
able on the outside, as friends;
but cautious on the inside, as
enemies.”

The senior Senator from Penn-
sylvania is the Senate Minority
Leader which makes him one of
the most influential men on «Cap-
itol Hill. Throughout his ten-
ure. Scott‘s primary concern has
been foreign relations. resulting
in his initiating much of the na-
tion's foreign policy.

In light of his position, it seems
advisible for us to re-examine
those statements. What does Sen-
ator Scott mean. ‘ . .we should
not lose distinction between
friends and adversaries?"

It would seem that this atti-
tude will not help to strengthen
our foreign relations, America’s
intention by Scott’s admission —
but will further divide our nation
from the communist super-pow-
ers with the constant reminder

that we two are not partners in

the game of world survival, but
opponents in the battle for that
survival.

The above was the message.
now historic. which James Mc-
Cord sayd that he got from his
bosses in the Nixon Adminis-
tration when he threatened to tell
all he knew about the Watergate

phrase of how Newsweek kicked
off its coverage of the Water-
gate expose and trial. noting that
no news story since the Korean
War has sustained itself long
enough to warrant five conse-
cutive cover stories.

With such colorful catchwords

Hiss was imprisoned for perjury

he had been framed. The prose-

Richard Nixon.

accused of having an illegal sup-

year. contributed by a hundred
California businessmen. On Sep-
tember 23. 1952. Nixon made a
now-famous TV rebuttal in which
he allegedly accounted for all of
his personal finances in a sort of
domestic fireside chat. He ex-
plained that the only political
gift he had received was the

Mr. Nixon is now in a different
league; $18,000 was a big deal
in 1952.

In his speech. President Nixon
assumed "responsibility" for

Column and a Half  

By JOHN METCALFE

As a full-time job, the search for Wisdom
is a deeply depressing occupation. I have spent
long afternoons on the sidewalks of the Road of
Life looking for even a trace of Wisdom. and
never found any.

‘The search has more to recommend itself as
a hobby; it is then not so much a search as a
willingness to recognize Wisdom, and enjoy it.
Besides being rare, the precious commodity is
inclined to be surprising. to come at us sud-
denly from the most unlikely angles.

Over the weekend exactly that happened. I
was struck speechless by a dazzling bolt of Wis-
dom from a source I had long considered un-
likely at best, grotesquely unlikely. unlikely
beyond the usual bounds of unlikelihood. be-
neath contempt and beyond laughter . . . .

Excuse me. A deep breath and I’ll be all
right. Back to the narrative.

Over the weekend. Spiro Agnew was invit-
ed to speak to the graduating class of a school
named Drexel. which school gave him an hon-
orary degree in lieu of a fee. Mr. Agnew exhal-
ed a few platitudes by way of warm-up. and
launched into his speech proper.

(After the fact, the speech was described as
having had nothing to do with Vietnam or Wat-
ergate, by reporters who havegrown impervious
to Wisdom.)

The speech went on to cleverness. The Vice
President advised the graduates not to pay too
much attention to the faults of those currently
in poqer. as they were most unlikely to repeat
those mistakes. Each generation, he went on.
manages to screw up the world in its own dis-
tinctive way; he left unsaid the corollary that a
preoccupation with avoiding the‘ mistakes of the
past helps us in the invention of the errors of the
future. All this was only clever: the Wisdom is
coming.

Most of our troubles (pay close attentioniare
caused by an excess of expectation. We allow our-
selves to be seduced by so-called leaders -who
casually propose Ideals which can" never be
achieved. and then feel badly about not attain‘-
ing these lofty goals. That‘s it! In a handful of
words, he has given us Universal Wisdom.

Apply this wisdom to Vietnam. When Nixon
claimed to have a secret plan to resolve the war,
we allowed ourselves to imagine that he planned
to end it quickly and cleanly.

When Law and Order were mentioned. the
best of us imagined it meant we would all live
orderly lives in accordance with the law. The
worst of us imagined it was a code-word for re-
pression. We were all wrong. The repression was
there already, and the term was not a code-word.
but a contraction for the real principle: "I make
the laws and you take the orders.“

When applied to Watergate. this Wisdom
comes into its glory. I have a copy of the Con-
stitution among my contraband books, and I
have read it. Nowhere does it say that the Pre-
sident must be honest, or even honorable. We
have read that meaning into an otherwise neu-

‘tral document. Nowhere does it read that we are

to be ruled by elected rather than appointed of-
ficials. It is vague on the point, and we have
read too much into it.

The “guarantees" of Life. Liberty. and the
Pursuit of Happiness are in the Declaration of
Independence, not the Constitution; they do not
have the force of Law.

The extensio/ns are endless. I am weak with
awe. I have stood in the presence of Wisdom.

My mind is made up; I shall turn Republi-
can. I am old enough, at long last, and I have
shunned the true light long enough. No longer
will I carp at my betters.’ For those who doubt
my sincerity. I will add a startling bit of infor-
mation. "

I have alredy applied to the appropriate au-
thorities for an initial, to be placed before my
first name.

Old Times Fine

by JOHN SMITH

Arts Editor

Gillette Elvgrin once studied theatre arts in
London, and during the course of these studies, he
was fortunate enough to View one of the first pro-
ductions of Pinter’s Old Times. After the perform-
ance, he realized that the man sitting in the next
seat was Harold Pinter himself. Judging‘ from Elv-
grin‘s production of Old Times, currently showing
at Stephen Foster, I might go as far as to say that
a little bit of Printer must have rubbed off during

that evening—Old Times is excellent.

Strange, that I should open this review with a
memory, for that is at the center of Old Times-
memories. The hazy, half-faded memories we tend
to hold, dead thopgh they be, as sustance for life in

the present.

The story itself is quite simple. Anna (Mary
Robb Jackson) comes to visit ex-roommate Kate
(Julie Quinio) after 20 years. In the interim, Kate
has married a man named Deely (Daniel Chodos) .

When Anna arrives, a subtle struggle ensues-
both husband andold friend vie for the Kate they
once knew, a sensual, dreamy girl who now appears
unaffected by the obvious wooing of her attentions.
Their tale is always of how she was and at one point.
Kate remarks that they speak of her as though she

were dead. As the drama unfolds, we see that mem-

bers are not what they appeared to be.

Pinterian drama, especially Old Times, is a
subtle interplay, not only of conversational com-
munication, .but of physical communication. A

Fare at Foster

glance, a facial expression will usually tell us more
than 10_times that of dialogue. Pinter‘s characters
talk around, though, at, and over each other. What
they say is not necessarily what they meant.

This presents special problems for the director
and actor. Both must be sure that the true meaning
of the dialogue becomes clear through these min-
ute gestures, pauses, and expressions. Elvgrin and
his cast have handled these aspects quite well.

- Chodos and Jackson are fine in their run around
mono and dialogues. The pauses and innuendoes are
perfectly timed—when snipped with ease as the
situation becomes more and more strained.

As this is happening, Quinio remains beautiful-
ly and bizarrly detatached, floating through tye ac-
tion much as the memories of husband and ‘friend
- float through their minds. Each line (youcould call
them punch—lines, because many of them are very
funny) is executed and orchestrated so that it car-
ries the full impact of its meaning.

The set for these fine players is a chrome and
white modern furnishing against a starck black
backdrop. Highly suggestive of the playwright’s
message. Bleak, sterile, an excellent job by Hey-
man. And, as I praise the scenery, the costume
measure up to the overall standards of the produc-
tion. Notably—Kate’s clothing——grey and white
done to perfection.

All in all, Elvgrin has achieved a complete im-

Vile Smut Proves a

Tasty Piece of Garbage.

by JOHN SMITH

A somewhat belated_and apolo-
getic review for the Studio The-
tre. This concerns the latest pro-
duction of a series of vignettes
entitled Vile Smut. It's belated be-
cause I didn’t get a chance to re-
view it before it closed, and apo-
logetic because it was a great lit-
tle piece of entertainment.

As the title implies, it was quite

an evening of vile smut. The play—'

lets ranged from downright filth
and perversion. to interesting so-
cial commentary on the mores

and morals of modern life.

Within the course of the eve-
ning, I saw an American in Paris
brutally murdered, prostitutes
haggling with their mother, a
mini-drama of a girl and her boy-

friend talking on the phone, was
told that sex was as dirty as I
always thought it was, and saw a
drag-queen strip-tease that would
tickle anyone’s gay fantasies. To
describe these in any detail would
be impossible and useless.

As far as production goes. this
one was unique. The audience was
seated on the floor, and the action
happened on several different
stages placed around the audi-

ence. The acting showed that col-

lege students do get into a little
smut now and then. I could tell by
the lusty grins behind every well-
delivered line.

A spicy bit of trash to which I
say bravo ST. I‘ll make sure I see
your next show in time toalert

INDY 500 Leaves

INDIANAPOLIS «AP» — Two
race drivers and four spectators
injured this week during the In-
dianapolis 500 race remained
hospitalized. Driver Swede Sav-
age still was in critical condition.

Driver Dave "Salt" Walther
was reported to be still in serious
condition. A spokesman for
Methodist Hospital listed both
drivers‘ conditions as stable.

Savage was injured Wednesday
when his car smashed against a
wall on the 58th lap.

Walther was inured last Mon-
day, the day originally set for the
race, in a blazing first-lap acci-
dent. Three Wingage, Ind., wom-
en remain hospitalized with
burns suffered as fuel from Wal-
ther’s car splashed the crowd.

Sue Rankin. 15. and Diana Dais-
ey. 14, still were listed in serious
condition with burns suffered in
the Walther crash. Dorothy West.

moving quickly to improve rac-
ing safety in the wake of the trag-
edy-marred Indianapolis 500 mile
announced sweeping
changes Saturday in the aerody-
namics and fuel loads of Nation-
al Championship circuit cars.

USAC President Reynold C.
MacDonald received telephone
approval from the club’s board of
directors to enact the changes,
following a special meeting with
drivers, car owners, and mechan-
ICS. -

"We felt we needed to respond
quickly and positively to sugges-
tions for rule changes when our
members deemed such changes
necessary." MacDonald said.

Before the running of the

O Schaefer 500-mile race July 1 at

Pocono. Pa.. wing sizes will be
shaved from 64 to 55 inches in
width and fuel tanks in the right
side of the car will be closed off
and filled with impact resistant
material. Fuel tank capacities in
the pits will be decreased from
375 gallons to 340 gallons at Po-
cono and the Ontario 500.

That means drivers will be lim-
ited to only the 40-gallon tank in
the left side of the car, and me-
chanics will have to “de-tune” the
cars slightly to make sure of bet-
ter gas mileage.

Race driver Boger McCluskey.
who attended the meeting. said
the elimination of fuel in the right
side of the car will greatly re-
duce the possibility of fire in a
brush with the wall.

In most accidents. he noted it
has been the right side fuel tanks
that have been ignited. As for re-
ducing speeds. McCluskey isn‘t
sure the reduced wing sizes or the
limited fuel supplies will make
that much difference.

“I don’t think you could say the
changes will lower speeds five
miles an hour or even anything
at all,” he said. “We’re still going
to need the added stability the
wings give us. ’

"The changes may put less drag
on the engines. And if there is less
drag we hope there will be less
engine failure.“

brings home a black lover. who is
gruesomely slaughtered after a
night of passion (ah. the price of
«ones sins) by a‘ demented look-
ing Danielle, Dominique. The
deed is witnessed by an ambitious.
although frustrated. reporter
Grace Collier (played by Jennifer
Salt. who may be remembered
from small parts in Midnight-
Cowboy and The Revolutionay) ,

in the best Hitchcockian (Rear
Window) tradition. Naturally, no
one believes her story (her "anti-
pig" columns did little to endear
her to the local constabulary ).

She decides to investigate, look-
ing more for the “big story”
which could help her career than

mere justice for the wrong-doer.
As Grace digs further into the
background of the seemingly in-
nocent Danielle and her estranged
husband Emil (a sinister Bill Fin-
ley) she becomes embroiled in a
taut, psychological drama that
paranoids will love.
