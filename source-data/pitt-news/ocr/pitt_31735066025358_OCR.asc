Two weeks after a Pitt student
was raped while walking home
from a fraternity party, Pitt Greeks
will implement a new escort
system this ‘weekend.

The Greek Guardian system
will have approximately six to 10
men serve as escorts for people
from fraternity parties. "T he
proposal calls for two men to be
stationed on the hill, two men

office. '
Students can use the escort
service by calling the IFC office
at 648-7825. A dispatcher will
then beep one of the escorts,

who will arrive within 1 5 minutes
to walk the person home. The
escort system will beoperating
from '9 p.m. until 5 .a.m. on
weekend nights.

Jeremy Weiss and Douglas
Segal, who are both members of
the IFC judicial board, proposed
the plan to the Panhellenic
Association last night.

Segal said that this Friday the
IFC will be staging a trial run of
the escort system to see what
type of demandit has and to see
if everything moves smoothly. At

the moment the escort service ‘

will be exclusively for fraternity
social events.

Last night Fang Li-Zhi, a renowned
Chinese dissident, emphasized the close
relationship between politics and science
in modern China. Fang and his wife spent
more than a year in the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing, where they sought political asylum
following the Tiananmen Square massacre.

“Chinese~authorities like science...,they
don’t like scientists,” Fang said.

Fang was the Vice President of the
Beijing Institute of Science and Technology
prior‘ to his exile and is now a professor of
physics and astronomy at the University of
Arizona.

“In China, astronomy is the forbidden
field,” Fang said. Education in China has
been associated with politics and pro-

.freedom thought for centuries, Fang said.

He illustrated student enrollment curves at
Beijing University’s.~science department,

_ which fell drastically during WWII, during

the Cultural Revolution and after Tiananmen
Square (when it dropped from nearly
2,000 to 700).

“If you teach students science, it
encourages freedom-thinking. Communist
systems have historically followed this

thinking,” Fang said about the Chinese
government’s adopted Marxism. Prior to
the incident at Tiananmen Square, “most
scientists were pro~freedom,” Fang said.
Fang discussed the problems facing
Chinese scientists. “You can’t say the idea
is yours. You have to say the idea came
from Marx,” he said. The problem is that
“according to Marxism, all problems of
cosmology have been solved. They
haven’t.” ‘ ,
To illustrate this, Fang displayed an
overhead transparency he used when
teaching his classes in Beijing. The lower
half displayed the big bang theory — that
the universe is the result of one big unified
explosion. The upper half proclaimed the
famous quote by Marx: “Workers of the
world. Unite!” .
Ideological conﬂict is not the only
problem faced by Chinese scientists. T 0

British journal, Fang wrote an article in
Scientifica, the Chinese version of Popular
Science. In response to his article, a
government official described by Fang as.
the “most top leader in charge of ideology"
wrote a letter which ended‘: “I never
studied cosmology, but I don’t like the

especially when you are talking about the

top schools,” he said.

Pitt’s Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of
Business ranks 24 out‘ of 263 schools
offering accredited MBA programs,
according to a recent article in U.S. News
and World Report.

Katz Dean H. J. Zoffer said he is pleased
with the high placement but doubts the
validity of the criterion used to determine
the exact standings.

“They, are trying to use figures that are
measurable to determine the exact quality
of a school in comparison to other schools,”

Zoffer said.

“Using quick and dirty numbers does

not measure a school's exact quality,

The annualreportliststhetop2Sgtaduate
business schools by student selectivity,
graduation rate, placement success and
reputation among academics and
CEOs.- ' _

Katz had high graduation rates and
placement success but ranked lower in
status among CEOs.

Zoffer attributed this, in part, to Katz’s
relatively small size. _

“Our reputation hasn’t caught up to our
success yet," Zoffer said. . '

“Top CEOs have nothing to go by when
they are asked to rank the schools, and
name recognition is a lot easier at Harvard
than in Pittsburgh,” he said

But Zoffer noted that Katz has been
favorably mentioned recently in Forbes
magazine and Business Week, which may
help Katz’s reputation catch up.

In January, Forbes called Katz the
second-best MBA program for the
money. '

But because students are now more
concerned about jobs after graduation
than other factors, schools are. now
concentrating on career placement,

— according to U. 3. News.

“We are trying to shake loose the market
even more,” said Daniel Nagy, executive
director of placement at Katz.

“With, direct mailing and other
techniques, we, have probably dug up a
couple of hundred jobs from places where

we don’t usually look. We would not have
gotten them if we had just sat back," he
said.

The U. 3. News article also reported an
unexpected boom in business-school
enrollment that came with the recession.
Business students are electing to spend

more time in school, it said, rather than -

risk the tight job market that awaits
graduates.

Director of Admissions Cathy Valentine
said that Katz has experienced an upsurge
in admissions, but she attributed it to
improvements within the school.

“Our increase was not just for those
reasons,” she said. “We have gotten more
applications from overseas -- really from
all sources.”

Alcohol’s severe effect on campus

It is estimated that the high-risk
use of the drug alcohol is involved
in 70 percent of violent behavior
on campus, 41 percent of

- academic failures, 44 percent of
emotional difficulties, 68 percent
of damage in residence halls, 62

percent of campus violations and ’

28 percent of student
attrition.
These ﬁgures are from a survey
conducted by Dr. David S.
Anderson of George" Mason
University and Dr. Angelo F.
Gadaleto of West Chester
University. ~
Now, of course, we cannot
reduce all issues of public safety
to use of alcohol. However we
cannot dismiss the countless
 surveys that link the use of this
 drug with all sorts of crime and
9 Violence.
' When we use alcohol it lowers
our inhibitions, but inhibitions

can be both good and bad. If I am
inhibited about introducing
myself to you, that's bad. IfI am
inhibited about hitting you when
you call me a name, that's good.
When we use this drug, both types
of inhibitions are lowered.

You may feel more conﬁdent,
but you are also more apt
to act on aggressive
impulses.

For many women who use this
drug, the inhibitions that may
warn them of danger are
lowered.

There are things we can do
about this correlation between
alcohol and public safety.

First, we cannot view use of the
drug on our campus as being
primarily a legal issue. It is
primarily an issue of health and
safety.

Second, know what this drug
does! Sounds simple, but most of

us are rather ignorant of the

dynamics of alcohol use. ’
Student Health Service offers

the PEAR (Personal Education,

. Assessment and Referral) program

to teach about the physical,
psychological, social and
spiritual effects of the drug
alcohol. _ I A

GEAR (Greek Education,
Assessment and Referral) was
proposed by Chris Miller, a Delta
Tau Delta member, after he and
his brothers attended the four-
hour PEAR program.

PEAR evaluations indicate that
98-100 percent of those who
attended felt .It'ha't ‘PEAR; “is
valuable‘ for our academic
community. ' 0' _ , A
' Many said that it should be

-required. GEAR adaptation

of ‘PEAR.

The purposesi_l:§f  -(and .

PEAR) are to prevent alcohol-

related problems, and to intervene
with friends who are developing
problems before there is some
kind of tragedy.

Most of us know someone who
we think has a “drinking
problem.” ‘

Isn’t it time we all knew what to
do to help? Alcohol is America's
(and Pitt's) No. 1 drug
problem. ,

If we address this issue, many
of our concerns for public
safety will be addressed as
well.

Organizers for the 1993 March
on Washington for Lesbians, Gays

‘and Bisexuals explained the

ongoing plans and problems of
the march and tried to enlist the
help of members of the Bisexual,
Gay and Lesbian Alliance last
week.

Reggie Bostic, one of the two
organizers who spoke at a
BiGALA meeting, said that at the
last march in 1987, 650,000
marchers descended on
Washington, D.C. The planners’
goal for 1993 is to have one
million participants.

“The march is going to be one
of the major civil-rights marches
in history," Susan Chen said.

The planners’ main priority next
year is racial and gender equality,

and to ensure that this goal is
upheld, they decided to require
that 50 percent of the planners be
women and 50 percentbe people
of color.

But Bostic said that, at least in
the Delaware, Pennsylvania and
New Jersey region that he
represents, organizers are running
into problems with both the
diversity requirement and ‘the
number goal.

“I did the typical outreach [to
prepare for the regional meeting].
but that did not work,” he said.
“We got to the first regional
meeting, and there were only 24
people there: one person of color,
which was me, two women and
the rest were white males.”

The regional representatives
also drew only a small group at
Pitt, perhaps because of the lack
of attention given thus far to the

away. But the organizers plan to
step up their efforts to reach out
to potential marchers.

“We plan on taking more road

Chen said.

There is also a meeting in
Harrisburg on April 25 for the
Delaware, Pennsylvania and New

then be decided on at the national

and the right of same-sex students

anti-abortion rights movement 10 to 15 years ago,
individuals continue to press for state action in one of the
most private spheres of a woman’s life, her reproductive

. choices. Similar, many of these so-called pro-life forces

have opposed allowing families or individuals the right to
make a choice whether or not to sustain life support
systems for terminal ailment. ' '
Last week, a Florida couple’s pain and anguish was
aggravated by a Florida couI.t’s_ action. On. March .21,
Carnpo-Pearson family faced a tragedy ‘— their newborn
girl was born without a full brain. The family decided to

remove the child from life support systems. However, a '

Florida court blocked the parents’ wishes to have the child
rendered legally brain dead so that her organs could be
donated to save the ‘lives of other children.

A judge ruled Thursday that since the brain stem was
functioning and maintaining some bodily function, the
baby did not fit the ‘category of “brain death.” In Florida,
state law deﬁnes death if brain functions cease. The brain
stem activity prompted the action on the part of the court

It is an unfortunate situation for the family. Their wishes
were ﬂatly denied by the court in an almost morbid

Final thoughts on club’s discrimination

In light of the controversy stirred by the actions
of the Philosophy Club and Pre-Law Society,§lt is
clear that many people simply did not understand.

The point of the Philosophy Club’s action was to
force the administration to actively address the
inconsistency between anti-discrirnination and
ROTC polices at the university. In contesting our

policy, the administration would have to contest.

ROTC’s as well 

Susan Roth was right (Letter to the editor, March
19), this does send a “dangerous signal.” However,
it is -one that is no more dangerous than that of the
ROTC. The question is: why is our action considered
dangerous when ROTC's is not? The fact that
discrimination is tolerated on some levels of the
university and not others raises serious questions as
to the university’s commitment to and responsibilities
concerning its anti-discrimination policy...

The view that the reputation of the Philosophy
Club or the reputation of the philosophy department
has somehow been scarred is erroneous and
reactionary. It seems that reputation is only an issue

The sororities’ reaction to the
proposal was positive.

‘ ‘I think the escort service is a

idea.”

During Fang’s stay at the U.S. Embassy, he attempted to have
an article published abroad, but he had no return address. He
wrote “Temporary Mailing Address: U.S. Embassy, Beijing” on
the paper but changed it when the Bush Administration voiced
discomfort over publishing the address of a known dissident as
one of its embassies.

Fang attempted to remain neutral during the Tiananrnen
Square massacre; however he was implicated as an instigator.
Persecution by the government was not an unfamiliar experience
for Fang. During the Anti-rightist Campaign of 1957, Fang was
expelled from the Communist party and sent to the
countryside.

He was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution but was
eventually released when the political tide turned. He continued
his research and was “officially rehabilitated” in 1979. Seven.
years later Fang was again expelled from the Communist party
for advocating democracy. He was allowed to retain his
university post.

Fang said he believes China has historically embraced or
rejected scientiﬁc theories according to the needs of those in
power. “The emperors knew science was important because
they knew it was a tool to maintain their power.”

Panhellenic President Lori
White said the program needs to
be a cooperative effort to work.

“I think [the escort service] will
only work if both Panhellenic
and the IFC cooperate. It’s going
to have to be widely publicized,
and people are going to have to

take advantage of it,” White said.

quality-point average.

“Despite all the circumstances
and distractions the typical non-
traditional student faces, it is
admirable and commendable to
achieve such a level of excellence.
Academic excellence is what the
University is all about,”
Henderson said.

Bolvin said that CGS students
are the finest group of students
he's ever had the opportunity to
work with.

“It’s extremely appropriate and

an exceptionally good idea for
the college to recognize the
students achieving high honors,”
he said.

The event, sponsored by the
SGC, was held in the William Pitt
Union's Lower Lounge and
included hor d’oeuvres‘, deserts
and musical entertainment by two
ﬂautists from the University Music

This recognition of students
exempliﬁes the total level of
academic excellence that we have
in CGS, Roberts said.

honor them,” she said.

None of the issues that were
the focus of the 1987 march have
been corrected, according to
Chen.

The representatives, who will
be taking the ideas discussed at
the regional meeting to the next
national meeting, also talked
about the previous planning
meeting held in Los Angeles at

which they decided on the name
of the march.

“The abbreviation Bi was used
because it was actually supported
by the bisexuals,” Bostic said.

“There were a lot of complaints
that there shouldn’t be any
reference to ‘sexual’ in the title.
It’s the same reason we don’t call
it the homosexual march,” Bostic
said. ‘

Morning swiin ends
Boyd’s ﬁnal season

By Jim Lakely
Sta1fl¥’rller

Two Weeks after placing
eighth at the Olympic trials,
Don Boyd expected to make a
splash at the NCAA swimming
championshipsinlndianapolis
last weekend- But before the
last ripple faded away in his
qualifying race, his season was
unexpectedly over. I

Despite posting lifetime best
morning swims in the 100 and
200 breaststroke, Boyd failed
to’ qualify for the evenings’
final heat in both ‘events.’ As
Pitt’s lone representative at
the championship meet, he
failed to score any points.

“Two weeks ago I was able
to make the finals at the
Olympic trials, and I couldn’t
even make the consolation
finals at this meet,” Boyd said.
“It was disappointing. I really
thought I would get {into the
final heat], but it just didn’t
happen.”

“That is the name of the
game,” men’s swimming head
coach Chuck Knoles said.

“Swimming fast in the morning. '

If you don't swim fast .in the
morning, you don't come back
at night.”

-.,---. ; ~,Bo_yd.~. .has«.~«never been. .a

morning person; he swims
fastest at night. But reasons for
his early exit may lie in the
meet’s format At the Olympic
trials, the pool was 50 meters
long; at the NCAAs, the pool is
only 25 yards long. The shorter
distance means more turns,
which, not being Boyd's strong
point, slowed him down.
Also, , ,ob_vi,ouslY “at. the

‘ Olympic trials /a“ll‘__.._.:(,;)£}  3,
swimmers are American. But
~,,.,-.inany top collegiate coaches,

in an effort to be more
competitive, recruit
international swimming
superstars. So the pool of talent
at the meet can be much

Stanford, a perennial
national swimming power,
won the meet by- a large
gmargin- Witnessing the
dominance of the other
swimming programs at the
meet was a learning
experience, Knoles said

“It snaps you into reality
when you go to a meet like
that,” Knoles said. “You realize
that even being the big dogs
in the Big East doesn't make
you all that big. .~

“You go to the NCAA
championships, and you can't
even score any points. It is
kind of a rude reality. We
have to staitbeing competitive
nationally and we are not there
yet,” Knoles said

Knoles said he came away
from the meet a little angry—
not at the performance of
Boyd, but at the performance
of the NCAA Due to a recent
NCAA mandate, no more than
I 270 swimmers could compete
in the meet. Lastyear 63 teams
sent representatives to the
meet, but because of the
mandate only 43 teams
competed. But
disturbing to Knoles than the
' lower swimming participation
was the striking dropoff in
attendance. .,.  -

According to Knoles’

estimations, only about 300
people showed upto watch
the event on the first night and
the average attendance the

rest of the weekend was 800. ,

This compares to consistent

Steve Sax came in a deal that sent Melidio
Perez to New York, and he will team with
shortstop Ozzie Guillen to form one the
best double-play combos in the game. Sax
brings speed and savvy, while Guillen
gets better every year. Center fielder and
lead—off man Lance Johnson is in the
lineup for one reason: defense. He's the
best defensive outﬁelder in the division,
and any offense he gives is a bonus.Newly-
acquired George Bell will solidfy the

outfield and regulate Dan Pasqua to the .

It's hard to believe the fans of the Texas

“Murderers Row" or “Masher’s Row’ for
Julio Franco, Ruben Sierra, Rafael Palmiero

Continued from page 8
Hr, 116 RBIs) belted his way to
the top—five list of nine different
offensive categories, while his
stablemate, Gonzalez, dared
pitchers to work around Sierra.
These thoroughbreds will run
deep into September before
settling for second place.

The Rangers possess the
capability to score more than
they did last year, but the
promising young arms that
received the moniker of “Texas
Heat" failed miserably. Bobby
Witt, Scott Chiamparino, Kevin
Brown and Kenny Rogers did not
reach even minimal expectations.
Nolan Ryan and Jose Guzman
will carry the load, but for Texas
to topple Chicago, a third pitcher
must emerge, along with a
dependable set-up man for steady
closer Jeff Russell. The one plus
is that 20-year-old, cannon-arrned
phenom Ivan Rodriguez will
handle the staff and punish
opposing baserunners.

The burden of repeating and
several key departures will hurt
the Minnesota Twins but not as
much as most critics believe. This
is a clubthat feeds off its marquee
players: Kirby Puckett and Kent
Hrbek. Throw the underrated
Shane Mack (.510 18 HR, 74 RBI)
into that group with another solid
year. Unfortunately, Hrbek is gone
for two to six weeks with a
shoulder injury. The loss that will
hurt Minnesota is Dan Gladden

as the lead-off man took his glove
to Detroit. Role players Chuck
Knoblauch and Greg Gagne keep
the defense solid in the middle,
while catcher Brian Harper (.31 1
and 69 RBI) and designated hitter
Chili Davis (.277, 29 HRs 93 RBI)
will produce more than enough
offense. I

Many point to Toronto's signing
of Jack Morris as the axe to
Minnesota's hopes, but
realistically, would Morris have
duplicated last season’s
performance? Acquiring John
Smiley should help to fill the
void,’ but it’s impossible to
measure how well Smiley will do
in the Metrodome. Scott Erickson
and Kevin Tapani are more than
capable of supplying 37 or 38
wins between the two of them.
Rick Aguilera is a rock in the pen,
but set-up man Carl Willis needs
to prove himself again. The Twins
are still dangerous and will nudge
the A’s for third.

The Oakland Athletics
succumbed to age, freak injuries
and whining stars. They had
spurts all season but finished in
the middle of the pack. Two
schools of thought here. Either
the A’s are done, ready to walk
away from their lost dynasty, or
they lurk silently, burning to rise
up and rip the hearts out of a
young Chicago team again. First,
they need monster seasons from
Rickey and Dave Henderson.
While “Hendu” has been the most

First-year student Niambi Daniels
came in ﬁrst in the long-jump
competition.

She also finished second in the
triple jump and third in the high
jump events.

Two—time Big East champion
Joanne Warner performed well,
taking first in the discus, javelin

and shot put events. Warner is
yet another performer from the

team's impressive junior class.

First-year student Stacy Roth
finished third in the shot put
competition, but she took first in
the hammer throw.

Pitt finished first in all of the
relay events, which included the
400-meter relay, the 1600-meter
relay and the 3200-meter relay.

consistent of any of the A’s, Jose
Canseco is the most spectacular.

The revival of Rickey is what
Oakland needs to contend. That,
and huge seasons from Dave
Stewart and Bob Welch. Don't
hold your breath. Behind them is
the steady Mike Moore (17-9,
2.96). The A’s are hurting after
these three, but_ they can still fall
back on Dennis Eckersley.
Inexplicably, set-up men Rick
Honeycutt and Gene Nelson
dropped off far. Names like
Lansford, Weiss, Darling, Show
and McGwire will be the deciding
factors here. The A’s still have
enough talent to compete, but
now they need more production
from role players. They will scare
teams again, but they just do not
have the horses to finish higher
than fourth, edging Seattle by a
game or two.

The Seattle Mariners will
contend. A new life for slugger
Kevin Mitchell will result in more
souvenir baseballs in the seats of
the Kingdome, like maybe 52 or
53 of them. Hitting behind all-

world center fielder Ken Griffey
Jr. (.327, 22 HR, 100 RBI), Mitchell
should challenge Cecil Fielder
for the A.L. home run crown.
Blend in right f1elderJay Buhner’s
27 homers and the “Seattle Power
Brokers” are open for business.
The M’s need third baseman Edgar
Martinez to start the engine for
these guys.

If it weren't for an injury to
Brian Holman, Seattle’s pitching
would look great in this division.
But Holman will not be ready
until rnid-season, so it’s imperative
that Randy Johnson and Erik
Hanson come out smoking. Left-
hander Russ Swan will leave his
set-up role in the pen to bolster
the rotation, so Mike Schooler
will be the main man in relief.

Neitherthe California Angels .

nor the Kansas City Royals .have
a prayer. The ridiculous thing is
that the Angels have the strongest
starting pitching in the division
but still won't contend. Arguably
the fiercest trio in the game, lefties

Mark Langston, Chuck Finley and _

Jim Abbott produced 55 of Cali’s

81 wins and absolutely cannot A

drop off, or the Angels are looking
at an ugly year. Just remember
the Angels traded for Von Hayes
and signed Hubie Brooks. They
are a desperate bunch. Whitey
Herzog promised Angel fans a
monster deal over the winter, but
.Santa Claus never showed.
Herzog is now the Grinch. _
The Royals are now New York
Mets West after sending two-time
Cy. Young winner Bret
Saberhagen to the Mets for Kevin

McReynolds, Gregg “The world

Keith Miller. They signed Wally

the offense, but the pitching is . I

shaky with injury-prone Mike
Boddicker and rehabilitated Mark
Gubicza counted on for steady
years.

Bright spots are center fielder
Brian McRae and a trio of talented
catchers in Mike MacFarlane,
Brent Mayne and Bob Melvin.
Too bad K.C. can only play one
catcher at a time.

Profs agree ’92 grads face recession, toughjob market

. By Heather Gahres

Staﬂ“ Writer

The economic climate is
expected to remain unchanged
with a difficult labor market. New
graduates will probably live more
poorly than they lived as college
students.

The average college graduate

spends over a year looking for an 1

attractive job. -
These are just a few of the
experiences awaiting this year's
graduating students,’ according
to economist Reuben Slesinger

' and rhetorician Ted Windt._
Internships and extracurricular.

activities are what are needed to
get a job. Slesinger said, "It's a
very, very difficult labor market.
Unless [the graduating seniors]

have extraordinary skills, they _

will not have a job."

Slesinger said employersare 1

looking for the experiences
students have had in their
collegiate careers. “[The
employers] look at the
extracurricular" activities,
internships, volunteer work or
did [the students] sit and drink
beer all afternoon and watch
television.”

Any type of volunteer work in

public organizations that helps,

students gain experience in
organizing activities, raising

Facing the task of helping
students land positions in a tight
job market, the University
Placement Service has recently
developed several innovations to
seek out hard-to—find jobs.

The office works with
graduating students in different
ways, from simply providing job
information to instructing students
one-on-one on how to conduct
phone calls. Students utilizing
the service can also check the

"c:_c_>n'ventional wall postings. and g
computer network for job listings. ‘
 But the office, acting on input ‘A
frornl job sources and seel<',ers_,.","_

has created several new services
to aid the process. According to
Patricia Carr, assistant to the

gi‘i£é‘c‘io‘r',l “ thé" 6ffi'ce A has ’”bé‘é'h’

compiling the most helpful job
leads in a new section of the
office entitled Hot Jobs and Hot

News.

“Hot Jobs is part of a well-
organized campaign, not just
random information,” Carr said.
“When we have a lot ofstudents
saying that they want particular
jobs then we call areas that we
might not generally cover to ask
for information. Sometimes we
get good leads.”

Office staffers have also been
questioning potential area

employers about openings. In '

the last two months they have

and 20 laboratories, and the
results of“thes_e calls _are posted '

Anticipation, anxiety and excitement fill
the air for seniors as the date for graduation
quickly approaches. Whether graduating
on time or not, it is an equally stressful
time for everyone.

For many, it is a nail—biting, hair-tearing
time waiting impatiently for acceptance or
rejection letters from the graduate schools
of their choice. _

Others have‘ shed a tear or two after
having to cut their long tresses of wild,
unconstrained hair because of interviews

- with different companies.

Then there are those who have absolutely
no clue about what theyare going to do.
They are so afraid of what will happen
when they are thrust suddenly into the
real world that they are contemplating
adding another major and hopefully
another couple of semesters to their future
plans.

Stephanie Myers said she is happy to be
graduating in four years and wants to get

Clinching or squandering that

on many factors, but the way
applicants present themselves
plays an important role in the
employer's mind.

Conservative is the key when
dressing for an interview.
Businesses and corporations look
for a‘ more conservative dress
code, according to Kevin Collins
of the University Placement
Center.

“Dress for the position for which
you are interviewing,” Pitt
placement counselor Patrick

When applying for accounting
or banking positions, men and
women should wear navy blue or
dark gray pin—stripe suits.

Brown President Gregorian commencement speaker

By Lisa Restivo
Staﬂ’ Writer

Author, educator, historian and
president of Brown University,
Vartan Gregorian will be Pitt’s
1992 commencement speaker.

As former president of the New
York Public Library, Gregorian
was able to raise the funds for a
$45 million restorationof the main
library building. ’ 9

As well as preserving and
enlarging the library's
acquisitions, expanding its staff
and increasing its public-service
hours, Gregorian tackled the
enormous job of computerizing
the card catalog. While head of
the NYPL, he was awarded at
least nine 9 honorary doctorates,
among other academic tributes.

Gregorian’s efforts provided the
inspiration andthe essential

ingredient to revive the library H

system from the downward spiral
that it was experiencing.
Gregorian’s fund-raisin g efforts
included the introduction to a
series of special cultural events,
like the presentation of the
National Book Critics’ Circle
Awards as well as the
Commonwealth Literary Awards.
In addition, Gregorian also

Dinners at which celebrities such
as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
and William F. Buckley Jr.
attended.

Presently the acquisitions of
the library rank behind only those
of the Library of Congress and
the Harvard University Libraries.

.When asked why he took the
postat the library, Gregorian said,
“The library is essential for higher
education. I will be dealing with
students and scholars. In a sense
I am only changing my focus, not
my interests.”

Prior to this 10-year undertaking
with the NYPL, Gregorian was
clean, provost and professor of

"history at the University of»

Pennsylvania.
Gregorian’s background led to
his development as an authority

on the Armenian culture and
history, as well as that of Iran.
Born in Northern Iran, his
grandfather operated an inn for
camel caravans. When his mother
died, Gregorian’s relatives told
him that she had gone to America.

_He imagined America to be a

country and a land of paradise,
which he said he set his heart on
seeing. ,

Animportant role in Gregori an’s
life, his grandmother took care of
him when his mother died. But
she also passed along her store of
folk wisdom. “She was everything.
She taught me that everything is
negotiable except your dignity,”
he said.

Gregorian said that at age 10 he
got a job_as a_ page at the Armenian
library. He said it was there that
he made the discovery that has
changed his life.

Upon his encounters with
books he said he entered “the
only stable world and the only
world that was immutable. Your
sense of justice of human
compassion 4 these were all
awakened by books, and in
retrospect I can see that this for
me was an outlet, a wonderful
outlet for hope and a way to
transcend my culture and see the
world,” he told The New Yorle
Times. 7

After graduating in 1955 from
the College Armenian, Gregorian
worked as a reporter for a year
for various Beirut newspapers.
Later he became an instructor of
Armenian History at College
Armenian.

As a Stanford University student
in 1958 he earned his B.A. in
history and humanities. He earned
his Ph.D. degree in history and

humanities in 1964. During these

years he developed his role as an
educator, teaching Armenian
history and culture at the
University of California at
Berkeley.

Meanwhile, Gregorian
continued to write articles on
Armenian literature and other
subjects relating to Beirut,
including “The Cult of Stalin” and
“Process of Destalinization in
Armenian Literature” and his
book, The Emergence ofModem
Afghanistan, Politics of Reform
and Modernization, 1880-1946

Sometimes Gregorian wrote
under the pseudonym V_herian.
Being a politically active
individual, he said he believed
that organizations of all types

have a right to be heard. He

agreed to serve as the faculty

Cover letters and résumés
should be viewed as ways to get
in the door for an interview. They
_won’t land a job, but as part of an
overall job-hunting strategy, they
can be very effective, according
to Kevin Collins of the University
Placement Service.

To Collins, resumes and cover
letters serve complementary
functions.

While the resume tells a
potential employer about your
education and work experiences,
the more specific cover letter
tells an employer the results of
"what you did with that
experience.

If a cover letter tells employers
what applicants want to
accomplish, the resume tells
employers what potential
employees have already

‘ accomplished.

In order to compose a résumé,

‘employment-seekers should
"make a list of facts concerning

 

 

Fifth Avenue

their education, job experience
and activities.

This list should also include
any awards or honors that might
distinguish them from other
applicants.

The next step is to determine
which of these items are most
relevant to the employer and
most related to the position being
pursued.

Résumés generally include a
heading containing your name,
address and phone number.

Following the heading is a
profile of your schooling, listed
in reverse chronological order.
Another section lists work
experience, again listed from most
recent to least recent.

These sections are generally
followed by a background
section, in which an applicant
should. list extracurricular
activities, volunteer work and
other personal information.

References may be listed below,
or they can be offered to the
employer upon request.

idea to7 state the name of the ’
position being sought at the top I
‘of the page.

Collins, who works primarily
with engineering students, said
he believes there are
three components to a good
résumé.

First, the resume must be
personalized. Because your
résumé will reflect your unique
background and assets, it is
important to construct your
résumé in the way that is most
ﬂattering.

“What markets you very well
may not work for someone else,”
Collins said.

Important in customizing your
résumé are the order in which
you list your skills and the
significance you place on each
one, according to Collins.

Second, the resume must be
readable and put together in such
a way that it serves as an easy

reference for an employer, Collins

said.

I someone’s attention",-"I .' Collins
said. .

, The rule of thumb, used by

‘placement counselorsgis the 10-
second scan. i

After looking over a person's
résumé for only 10 seconds, an
employer “should be able to get
a fairly good idea of who you are
and what you have to offer,”
Collins said.

Easy readability and
convenience both require the
employment—seeker to exercise
a large degree of selectivity when
deciding what to include
on a résumé, according to
Collins. ‘

“You can’t include everything,”
Collins said. _

The third essential component
of any resume is neatness and
attention to detail.

“The No. 1 application killers
are misspelling and typos,” said
Collins, who said that even

' seemingly insignificant errors can
be very noticeable to someone
who reviews résumés for a
living. V

“This is the first impression that
an employer will have,‘ Collins
said. ‘ .

"They can draw inferences from
that typographical error that may
not be fair to you.”

Résumés should always be
accompanied by a cover letter,
Collins said.

“lThe cover letter] is a way of
focusing the employer’s attention
on what you have to offer,” Collins
said.

A cover letter is more specific
and therefore should be written
with the employer in mind,

‘ according to Collins.

“It can’t be completely generic,”
Collins said. Whenever possible,
cover letters should be addressed
to a specific individual, Collins
said.

Collins said he feels that the
most important part of the
cover letter is the first para-
graph.

It is here that job-hunters should
include an explanation of what
they like about the company and
a summary of what they have to
offer it. .

This introductory paragraph
should include the specific title
of the position being sought, as
well as where the person
submitting the résumé found out
about the position being offered,
Collins said.

The body paragraphs of the
cover letter should offer details
of the applicant’s experiences and
qualifications.

_ This should include courses of
study germane to the position
and any pertinent job exper-
ience.

In addition, the applicant
should mention any special
abilities or training that could
prove useful.

“The cover letter is where you
first give hints about what you
can do for the company,” Collins
said. '

A good ending can go as far as
a good beginning in leaving a
good impression, according to
Collins.

“I like to see students close
with an indication that they will
contact the employer,” Collins
said. Times when you are

A available for an interview should «

also be offered.

As with the resume, a cover
letter should be a reﬂection of of
the person seeking employment.

“Put as much of yourself into it
as possible,” Collins said.

Discrimination on the basis of
race, sex, sexual orientation or
religion is prohibited by federal
law. '

No such information should be
included in either the resume or
cover letter.

Getting your résumé and cover
letters to the right people can
make your job—hunting more
efficient, according to Collins.

“You don’t necessarily have to

It is important for men not to

that resembles something a

Before going to the interview,
clothes should be neatly

said.

Kelly said that men should wear

no ﬁsh or beetle ties. The idea is
to remain low key, she said.

“A lot of people wear great

All shoes should be well-kept,
shined and professional. Women
should wear classic pumps — no
spikes or ﬂats. Men's shoes should
be shined and also conservative.

It is imperative that men wear
socks and that women never wear
stockings darker than their shoes,
Kelly said. ’

Hair can also make or break the
interview. Men should‘ have their
hair cut prior to the interview.
According to Kaufmann’s’. hair
dresser, Tom Weis, men's hair
should look neat, polished and
professional.

Kelly said that men with hair
below the ear lobe should pull it
back neatly in a pony tail. '

Weis said women’s hair should
not be wild but as basic and
smooth as possible. Shoulder~

length hair should be pulled back,
and layered hair should be styled
neatly. Many times the hair style
will depend on the person and
the type of job, he said.

Paying attention to details is

0 very important: Nails should be

neatly trimmed, and makeup
should be kept to a minimum.
Use clear polish, Kelly said.

Women should avoid wearing
a lot of perfume, if they wear any
at all. Likewise, men should stay
away from heavy aftershave.

Women should downplay
jewelry because, again, attention
during the interview should be
focused on yourqualiﬁcations.

Men should not wear earrings
to the interview, and women
should avoid wearing dangling
earrings or earrings bigger than a
quaner, Kelly said.

Women should come to the
interview with only one ring,
rather than five, on each hand,
Kelly said. They should not wear
a multitude of bracelets on each
wrist— a watch on onewrist and
a bracelet on the other will suffice.

Kelly said women can choose

to wear a necklace or a signature ’

pin but not both.

“In general it is always best to
be conservative because it is
always safe," Collins said.

H By Megan Bertino

News Editor

With the ever persistent
recession, unemployment on
the rise and one in 10
Americans collecting food
stamps, the job market looks
bleak for college graduates.

But before resigning
themselves to flipping
burgers, college graduates
should consider the more

, lucrative end of the fast-food
industry —— management.

According to_ Arby’s
manager Joseph Sheramm,

.an entry-level position of
assistant manager starts at
$17,500 a year.

Sheramm said the duties
for an assistant manager
include hiring, firing and
running the store. While it
took him four years to obtain
the position of manager, he
said the opportunities for
advance-ment are good and
so is the job security.

“It's not like you’re going
to get laid off,” he said.

Shannon T schake, assistant
manager of Roy Roger’s, said
turnover at his store is high
because of the long hours.

“The hours are unusual:

9 50 plus a week, five days a

week,” he said.

But with high turnover
comes the opportunity for
advancement. Tschake said
he worked as shift supervisor,
Roy’s’ entry-level postion, for
two months before being
promoted to management.

The pay scale for shift
supervisor begins at $16,000.

D.P. Lee, the“ district

;;fmiar‘iager “ for Burger King,‘
said salary depends on job
performance. “There are no
set rules governing wages in
the fast-food industry.
Period.”

He said the average
employee earns between

$12-18,000, but for the above- ’

ave rage employee, “The sky's
the limit."

“You can’t just be average,” .

he said.
