LRDC Gets Grant

The Learning Research and
‘Development Center at the
University of Pittsburgh has
been awarded a two-year grant
by the Buhl Foundation for a
project designing microcom-
puter-based programs for
practice in reading.
A major research program’ at
the‘ center focuses on the
processes involved in reading,
«the comprehension of text, and
- xlated verbal skills. The grant
of $143,000 from the Buhlt
Foundation will enable
center to combine the increased
uf1der'standing of the reading
process ‘gained from this
research with new advances in
"microcomputer technology.
The systems being set up will be

studentswith different needs,
supplementing existing
reading instruction. The
project’s staff are giving careful
attention to encouraging
teacher, school administration
and community interest.
According to Dr. Robert
; "laser, co-director of the center,
 the course of the project,
Pittsburgh students at selected
schools will use microcompu-
;ters to practice verbal skills and
"reading. The goal of this
project is both to show how
significant improvements in
reading proficiency might be
attained, and to provide in the
Pittsburgh region a national
example of community-schooh
university cooperation in

modern education.”

GeographyBeing Eliminated  

By LARRY LEDERER

Though a Faculty of Arts and
Sciences ad hoc committee recom-
mended reorganization and revital-

the geography
FAS Dean Jerome
Rosenberg has decided to proceed
with his proposal to eliminate it.

In an April  meeting with geo-
graphy faculty and students,
Rosenberg said he will prepare a
Planning and Resource Manage-
ment System (PRMS) document

. calling for the termination of the

department.
According to ,_Rosenberg, the

Vote
To Hike

Salary

By DIANE LEF'KC§WlTZ

The Budget Policies Committee
presented a request that the Senate
Council endorse a nine L percent

wfaculty pay increase for the 1983

fiscal year at the Senate Council’s
May meeting. .

Professor Wilfried Daehnick,
chairman of the committee, said
the purpose of discussing the pay
increase was to make certain that
the administration saw the facul-
ty’s sidefof the request for a pay
raise, not to bring the endorsement ,
to vote. ‘

j “The Chancellor, had to hear
that people are not satisfied,” said
Daehnick. “That’s as far as it

The Faculty Assembly, com-
prised completely of elected faculty
and no members of the administra-
tion, voted last week to endorse the
salary increase. ‘

According to Daehnick, the nine
percent is a balanced figure that
minimizes the burden on students»
who pay ‘about half of the faculty
salaries through their tuition. The
other half is paid by state funds.

Baehnick added the raise would
aid faculty who are “trying to catch
up to the inflation rate,” which is
8.9% this year. While the salary
increase last year was 10%, the

l, inflation rate stood at 12.4%

“We’re saying, ‘look, we’ve been
losing money every year,” said
Daehnick. “It’s time now to give
raises higher than inflation
because we’ve had salary increases
substatially less for the past five 0
six years." «
S Chancellor Wesley Posvar main-
tains that there is not room in the

-1983 budget for a nine percent

salary increase.

“This is the tightest budget
we've ever produced in the history
of this university,” Posvar said.
“There is no margin of safety back-
up. We’ve squeezed the tourniquet
in every possible way.”

A study by the Joint State
Government Commission of A the
General Assembly of the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania showed
that, although they com prise about
half of the University’s budget,
Pitt’s faculty salaries are five to 10

will offer his recommendation to
the chancellor, who will then pre-
sent the final decision. '
Rosenberg said he would have
Jiked to implement the ad hoc com-
mittee’s proposal, but because of
“fiscal constraints, I saw the diffi-
culty with this.  '
“In fiscal year 1980, the FAS
budget had the biggest reduction in
several years and I was given the
indication of more reductions in
future years,” he said. ‘‘I thus

began to realize that we would find
it extremely difficult to put resour-
ces back into geography so as to
strengthen the department."
Rosenberg said there are other

qreasons for his proposal, These

include, he said, that the depart-
ment has suffered declines in en-
rollment, has not made a “national
impact” in the rankings of its disci-
pline and was “recognizably weak

‘because it didn’t have a’ reputable
research phase.

“By closing the department, we
will be saving up to nearly,
$140,000," he said, “which is
appiroximately 0.5 percent of our
budget. The resources they already

have will not be lost, such as carto-
graphical instruments and library
journals because other parts of the
university are interested in obtain-
ing them, such as geology. Cut-
backs will have to be made
everywhere.” . 3
According to the dean, an auto-
nomous departmentof geography
is not needed because “other
departments here are doing work
geography is now interested in,”
However, Professor

the ad hoc committee to take over
the chair of geography when cur-

UCEP English Componenlcut

By ROCHELLE STEVWING

University Community Educa-
tion Program(UCEP) English
courses are being eliminated and
UCEP teacher/counselors will be
given advising tasks as the result of
a review of the progranry

Currently the program requires
its students to take seven courses

taught exclusively by the UCEP

staff. a -

UCEP students must complete
two courses in English, math and
physical science, plus one learning
skills course. They are also
assigned a‘ teacher/counselor to ,.
help them adjust to college life.“

‘ The elimination of the English
cgmponent sitemsfromrecommen--.

dations made by internal and exter-
nal review committees last year.

According to UCEP" Director
‘Joel Reed, the internal review com-
mittee recommended that the
UCEP English component be
eliminated or restructured.

Prior to the reviews, there had
been a question of _stability in the
English component because it
didn’t have a permanent coordina-
tor, Reed said. '

The English department will
begin assumingresponsibility for
UCEP English instruction in fall

' l”98‘3.

Funding cutbacks in the College
of Arts and Sciences advising center
caused anotherchange in the pro-

gram. Beginning next year, UCEP
teacher/counselors will also act as
advisors for their students.

“That is one of the ways we have
absorbed the cutbacks in advisors,”

Advising Center director Fred
Koloc said. .
Despite the recent changes,

Assistant CAS Dean jack Daniel
said the UCEP program is not
being eliminated. He said he fore-
sees no other changes being made
in the department in the near
future, and pointed out that the
program has been granted addi-
tional resources such as doctoral
level courses and curriculum devel-
’opment courses for UCEP
instructors.

United Facug : couec/ti

By DIANE SCl(ll..LO_

Pitt’s United Faculty is very near
receiving the minimum "percentage
of faculty authorization needed by
law to elect a collective barginning
agent, the group’s_ co-chairperson
Philip Wion said. '

“Collective bargaining is very
important and necessary because it
changes the basic process of the
relationship between faculty and
administration,” Wion said. "As it
is now, the administration consults
the faculty through the (Univer-
sity) Senate and various organiza-
tions, but it is not bound to
negotiate or come to agreement
with thefaculty on any issue.”_

The product of this negotiation,
Wion said, will be a collective bar-
gaining agreement or contract
which spells out conditions of
salary, fringe benefits, and terms of
conditions of employment, will
become binding on both parties.

The United Faculty, a result of

‘the merger between Pitt's Profes-
sional Union and the American
Association of University Profes-
sors, began collecting authoriza-
tion cards'from faculty members in
mid-February. As of last Tuesday,
the Union had 326 cards from the
barginning unit. ~ \

The barginning unit ‘is com-
prised of roughly L300 faculty
members from the college of arts
‘and sciences, the regional cam-
puses, the schools’ of engineering,
education, and social work, as well
as the graduate school of public
and international affairs. .
“In another week or so, we’ll be
over the 30 percent mark,” he said
and added that the United Faculty
hopes to have 50 percent by Sep-
tember to strengthen its position.

Some major goals and concerns
of the ‘ United Faculty include

improving communications-

between the administration and
faculty, standardizing the system
by which professors are paid, and

“Unions are usually perceived as
concerned only about the bread

fringe benefits. That's not true of
unions in general and certainly not
true of higher education unions
like United Faculty. ’We’re very
concerned ‘with whole decision-
making processes,’g' Wion said.

Wion cited the currentgcondition
of the geography department as an
example and said the administra-
tion seems intent upon disbanding

Vl€WS.- ’

“If the faculty had collective bar-
gainning with legal stan_ding, we
could at least work toward having a
much stronger role in decisions
like t.his,”»Wion said.

It would be possible for the
faculty to gain information about
the budget, so we wouldn’t be in

 the position of being told the uni-

versity can’t afford the geography
department; we would _know in
much greater detail than is now
possible," he continued. ,

How does the union effect the
amountgof time professors spend

“The faculty is at a disadvantage

they can "pull together their exper-

Soviet Lecture
Held

Dr. Thomas Romett, assist-
ant superintendent of the Butler
school district, spokeon the
education system and life in the
Soviet Union at David Law-
rence Hall May 7 in a lecture
sponsored by the Pittsburgh
Society for American-Soviet
Friendship. _

Romett explained that Soviet
e(lucation_ is free. However,
whether a Russian attends a

vocational school or a univer-.

sity depends upon his—perfor—
mance in aptitude exams.
The exams, he added, are
Qgtructured to give all Soviet citi-
 an equal opportunity at
careers, but "late bloomers‘ and
misfits are sometimes deprived
of these opportunities.
Discipline in Soviet society is
. very important, Romett said,
beginning with entrance into a
Boy Scout-like organization
called the Young Pioneers. ‘He
noted there was also little van-

V ;

dalism and graffiti in public I

places.

_ The lack of Russian courses
in American curriculum was a
source of embarrassment for
him, he said, since 70 percent of
all Soviet students take English
courses. _ '

The Soviet Union's Wester-

’ nization is apparent in other
Tvays. Soviets drink Pepsi, listen
to the Beatles, and watch for the
latest Paris fashions, Romett
added.

He was also impressed with
the necessity for the Soviet peo-
ple to wait in line for everything
from buying shoes to seeing the
tomb of Lenin.

Advertising was nonexistent
in the Soviet Union: there are

I no signs or billboards advertis-
ing products. Romett said, ‘‘I
/kind of missed that garbage."
Instead signs were used by the

state, to promote patriotic

themes.

Law School Wins Competition

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

A team of two University of
Pittsburgh law students recently
defeated 11 other teams and won
first place in the ‘National Client
Counseling Competition, which
was held in Sacramento, Ca. '

Although in previous years Pitt
has had teams make it to the
national round of the competition,
which is sponsored by the Ameri-
can Bar Association, this is the first
time it won the national
championship.

“The competition is designed to
simulate a law-office meeting
between the lawyer and clients,"
said Mark Nordenberg, law school
professor and coachtof Pitt's win-
ning team. '

Team members Linda T obih
and Judy Patterson, both third-
year law students, participated in
three half-hour‘ sessions” during
which they were judged on their
ability to establish a professional
relationship between‘ lawyer and
client, to elicit relevant informa-
tion and to provide sound legal
advice.

The first situation the team was
faced with was a couple about to
divorce, and they were asked to
assist in resolving child custody
and support problems.

In the second session, they met
with a mother whose child was
being physically abused by the
father and whose parental rights
had been threatened by a child we]-
fare agency. ’

The team was next judged in a '

session where they had been
appointed by a court to represent
the interest of a 16-year-old girl in
connection with her parents’
divorce.

They were judged in each of
‘these sessions on what Nordenberg
calls “their ability to accomplish
something productive” with their

clients in an initial meeting.

Each round was judged by a five-
person panel that consisted of two
practicing attorneys, two mental
health professionals and one law

rofessor.

Nordenberg said the reason for
having the two mental health pro-
fessionals on the panel is’ that the
competition “is designed in part to
emphasize the human dimension
of law, the part that’s not in the
books." I ‘ .,

Team member Judy Patterson
said that human dimension “is
what this competition was all
about.”

She said the competition was a
test to see if the students were
emphatic enough to find out what
the problems were in a given situa-
tion. It also tested the students’
ability to get the client's trust to
reveal all of the information and
then have enough knowledge of
the law to handle the (BS6, she said.

The competition was begun 15
years ago at the University of
Southern California and was origi-
nally only for other Los Angeles
area law schools. About 10 years

ago it was taken over by the Ameri-
can Bar Association, and now vir-
tually all of the accredited law
schools in the country participate,

‘according to Nordenberg.
This year 140 law schools in the "

country participated in one of I2

ning teams competed against each
other on the national level’ in

LeftaMust Combine

By PEGGY FERRI

Despite the political left's sectar-
ian history, it must combine to suc-
cessfully' combat
Reagan's policies, author and
social critic Michael Harrington
said at a Pitt lecture on May 6.

Harrington is chairman of the

Democratic Socialists of America
my), a group formed by the
merger of the New American
Movement and the Democratic
Socialist Organizing Committee.

Harrington believes that the for-
mation of coalitions such as the
DSA is the only hope for an alter-
native to Reagan.

“If workers, minorities, women,
environmentalists and peace
groups fight one another, then they
all lose,” Harrington said. “The
only hope for an alternative to Rea-
gan, since no one progressive con-

, stituency in the U.S. by itself is
-.-:large enough to carry the country.
is if we simply get together.

“Reagan knows that if he can pit
mgainst one another, fighting
over the declining resources—-

tlarrington: Political

we're cooked.”

Drawing an analogy between
our present economic state and the
Great Depression, Harrington said
that Reagan’s policies are failing
because the Phillip’s curve, the
economic rule of thumb that prices
and unemployment move in oppo-
site directions, does not work.

He explained that corporate
power has subverted the Phillip’s
curve so that when demand
decreases, the corporations raise
their prices to maintain profits.

According to Harrington, this
problem is further complicated by
the U.S. role in the world economy
and technological revolution.

“The crisis we are now facing is
not just one more down in the capi-
talist cycle,” Harrington said. “It is
something more profound that can
be solved by radical changes of the
system from within the system.” .

Harrington said that Reagan
offers a “foolish and cruel analysis
of the crisis” and predicted that
social_ security will be the next to
go. “Not enough ‘is spent on the
poor to balance the budget on the

backs of the poor," he said.

Harrington also emphasized the
need for alternative plans. He said
the Congressional Black Caucus
has already worked out a way to
restore Reagan’s cuts in social pro-
grams by ending “welfare for the
rich” and said that the alternatives
would be supported in these ways.

He agreed with the joint Eco-
nomic (.‘ommittee’s idea of con-
structing a modern railroad
system, thus creating jobs in the
public sector. In addition, he advo-
cated giving money to corpora-
tionsas “incentive to conform to
the democratic plan.”

DSA walks a tight rope between
the possibilities of human freedom
and practicality, said Harrington.

“We have to bring ideas and
make them relevant,” he said. “We
have to make socialism something
that it has never been in this
country—ordinary.” _

The Pittsburgh chapter of DSA,
formerly a chapter of NAM, existed
for 10 years before its historical

merger with DSOC last March, the .

retirement takes effect this Sep-
tember, said it will be the univer-
sity that is the “major loser.”
Muller said the dean has asked
for recommendations as to how a
programmatic presence of geo-
graphy might be maintained. But
according to Muller, this will be
“largely unsatisfactory” because it
“certainly can not meet the essen-
tiality of the subject as described by
the ad hoc committee.
.. “Within the university, geogra-
%’s importance is clear because
while other disciplines may deal
with geographical aspects of our
society such as the use and organi-
zation of the earth’s surface, these

are only secondary and peripheral I

A concerns to them, for geography is
the only discipline that takes the
look of the land as its primary focus
in question,” Muller said.

Muller continued by pointing
out that not only will the univer-

sity lose in the curriculum sense,’

but potential contributions such as
research efforts and cartographical
services to the university commun-
ity “will not be realized.

“The effects will be seen as both
 will happen directly and the
I that occurs regarding what
could have happened," the history
professor said. “I do not know why
they are contemplating termina-
tion to be honest, but I do have
some beliefs.”

He said first there is an “overem-
phasis” on the part of the adminis-
tration when examining strictly
financial criteria without faculty
consultation on programmatic and
research implications.

Secondly, Muller said he “sus—
pects" the upper levels of the
administration would like to
“move a unit” as symbolic of their
willingness to trim the university.

Lastly, he said the administra-

.,')r_1 is accepting “dire” enrollment
projections and if they are found to
be inaccurate, “they’ve lost.

“It’s realistic they‘re scared
about enrollment projections, but
they still can and must be ques-
tioned," he said. “The administra-
tion must answer taculty questions
of priorities and the allocation of
resources; without answers tothese
questions, the faculty, for example
the ad hoc committee, has little
voice in the programmatic shaping
of university policy.”

Does this set a precedent for the
closing of other departments by the
dean? According to geography

rgﬂtiate student Mark Ozark, it
does.

_“Since the Lakeview conference
calls for a very centralized decision-
’making process, I have no doubt
the dean and other administrators
have other various targets in
mind,” Ozark said. "This idea of

taking our departments and elimi-
nating them, or combining them
with other departments is not
new—the dean did it with biologi-
cal sciences, which used to be three
separate departments.”

Ozark _said there has been no
explanation for the provost's deci-
sion to reject the ad hoc commit-
tee’s recommendation and added
that he has been trying to get an
appointment with him, which may
happen soon.

“The dean told us in a meeting
that the elimination of geography
was for purely financial reasons,
and he has been telling us this all
along,” Ozark said. “But it is hard
to believe the budget is the sole
reason.”

According to part-time geo-
graphy instructor Marilyn David-
son, the administration is “using

a the $6,000 we need as an argument

for termination.”

Davidson said $6,000 is all the
geography department needs to
initiate the revitalization process.

“We hear rumors that the

administration is calculating the

explained where they got that fig-
ure,” she said. “There's millions of

dollars proposed to build a gradu- .

ate school of business and the
administration has bought new
furniture. Why can't we get our
$6,000? This tnoney can get us two
new faculty members, a new chair-
man and someone to
Muller in history.”
Ozark pointed out trouble for the

geography department has been
going on for six years. He said in
1977, Rosenberg called for termi-
nation because he felt the depart-
ment wasn't performing well in
research and had declining
enrollment.

“These arguments were rejected
by two committees,” Ozark said.
“The dean also said in 1977 the
department should be revitalized—-
he broke his promises to us because
he never did anything about it."

Davidson and Ozark both com-
mented that they would like to
think Pennsylvania taypayers
would “wake up” to the fact that
our “state appropriations are being

. misma_naged.”

According to Coordinating
Council tnetnber john Haer, there
were some differences between
NAM, a child of the '60s. and
DSOC, part of a much earlier and
critical tradition.

“However, both groups‘ did
agree on important issues and on a
vision of socialism that involves,
democratic participation and a
healthy respect for democratic’
tradition," Haer explained.

Pittsburgh DSA has demon-
strated against and organized on
behalf of many diverse issues and
concerns. Its members are active in
other groups as an individual, not
organizational effort. For example,
DSA members assisted in clerical
organizing at Pitt in I977.

DSA has youth organizations,
but Haer said that he would like to

. them on campuses. Pitt has such an
organization among its graduate
students.

“These titnes provide opportun-
ities in that people are open to

planned alternative to Reganom-
ics, The key is working within the

I democratic traditions.

He added that he is aware that
DSA is a small organization, but

believes it has the potential to’

grow.

"I took part in a round table discus-

discuss three perspectives in assess-
ing the Reagan Presidency, the pers-
pective of the Administration from
Congress, from the standpoint of the
Presidency, and one was supposed
to be an assessment of the Adminis-
tration from the standpoint of policy
and its general impact on institu-

tions,” Rockman said.

“One of the things l tried to point
out rather early on was that we

wouldn't have a panel assessing the
Reagan Presidency in this short a
period of time had it not been for the
Republicans‘ ﬁrm control of the
Senate and its persuasiveness in the
House of Representatives.

"After all, what makes this presid-
ency interesting from an analytical
standpoint is the fact that it seems to
have produced a fair amount of
change. One probably would not
have assessed the Nixon Presidency,
for example, in a comparable length
of time.

“That change it was involved in
producing was, to a considerable
extent, a result of the fact that the
Republicans managed to get control
of Senate by a pretty decent margin.
And they gained ideological streng-
thening in the House, as well as quite

That combination of characteris-
tics, plus the popular perceptions
exaggerated, of the consequences of
the 1980 elections—above and
beyond the change of seats—was
one very important factor in helping
to produce the political support for
the Reagan proposals of 1981.,

"The consequence? One appears

to be that the administration may
well be a victim of its early successes.
it did gain quite a few legislative suc-
cesses in 1981 , in fact, because there
were relatively few roll call votes. But
it gained important successes in
1981, and the successes to some
extent were a precipitant of the kind
of economic problems, the budge-
tary impasse and so forth—whether
right or wrong. That may well put the
Administration in a longer term bind,
and the longer term may have come
already in 1982.

"it's hard to assess the impact Ur
an administration in mid-stream; it’s
even sometimes hard to do that for a
decade or two decades later. So,
you're sort of coughing up instant
wisdom, while you're looking at an

administration that's not even half-

A way through its term.

“Still, it did have an unusual level
of success in the first year, which will
cause problems for the prospect of
future successes."

“Tire federal bureaucracy has
been a long-standing concern of
most Republican presidents particul-
rly. They usually want to do some-
thing with it. They are usually also
suspicious of cabinet ofﬁcials who, in
the words of John Ehrlichman, ‘tend
to go native,‘ tending to represent the
departments’ interests to the White
House rather than the other way
around.

"I think one of the things that this
administration has done that has
really escaped a lot of notice, yet is
very important, is that they have man-
aged to gain a substantial amount of
ideological unity in the departments,
in the bureaucracy. They have
decreased the tension between the
cabinet secretaries and their appoin-
tees in the White House, and at the
same time, increased it between
those officials (the cabinet secretar-
ies and their appointees) and the
highest or senior career officials.

"When the ideological cues are
very strong, how to act, this adminis-
tration has a high degree of ideologi-
cal unity and a stark contrast would
be the preceding administration.
Nixon tried during his second admin-
istration to attain that degree of unity.
The press was very conscious of the
fact that he was trying to attain a
strong degree of control in the White
House. At the time there was a lotof
talk about such a thing as an admi-
nistrative presidency.

“The president is very distanced
from detail, and again he is in many
respects Carter's exact opposite. Car-
ter immersed himself in detail. Detail
clearly bores (Reagan), and that (Car-
ter’s presidency) isnot his model of
what a president needs to do.

“I think there's this feeling that
there’s a need to constantly be visible
in terms of promoting your pro-
grams, your proposals.

“One of the ways of doing it is just
by making regular appearances.
There are lots of ways of doing it,
press releases, statements, et cetera.

"He can try basically to make a

. number of claims about why we are

where we are at in terms of the econ-
omy and different things. I think that
was the reason behind his last talk
and the reason for all the radio talks.
in the long term, I don't really think
that's all that persuasive a tool, but it
often does work effectively in the
short term.

"One example (of a failure or
breakdown in communication with
the American people) is during the
Carter administration, when one
sensed the president had kind of left
Earth, when we had the gas lines
during the spring and summer of
'79, and Carter left the country on a
couple of occasions—not for mat-
ters of vacation (Salt ll and Camp
David), but state business.

“When he came back, he went to
Camp David and communed there
with a variety of people. it was very
odd. It lasted about two weeks. I dis-
tinctlv remember people asking me.
‘What the hell’s going on?’ or ‘What's
happening up there?’
And then he came out and made
a speech and all that. But there was
no regular sense of his being in a
position of leadership and the same

is true to someextent of Nixon in '74.
“Nixon was obsessed with Water-
gate, understandably. And Governor
Schapp went down’ and got a
number of interest groups together
from trucking executives to ‘labor
leaders and people from the La ,1

Department to come up  Y

agreement which insured his
(Schapp'sl) election in ’74.

"We can't really tell all that clearly
after this period of time just what's
happened or what’s going to
happen. I think that what's happened
is fairly solidiﬁed and will be in place
five to 10 years.

“In political life, that is a long time.
But what goes beyond this past year
is very hard to assess. I've grown
increasingly skeptical that there's
much more change in the current
direction, for better or worse. The
political support on Capital Hill will
not be nearly as good. The sense of
newness, the change that was per-

ceived in the 1980 election -thm‘.

gone.

“The programs which were at the
administration's discretion to cut in
the budget, that is, what they pro-
posed to do in the budget, was sup-
posedly to get a hold of
programs——so-called ‘controllablesf
They mostly affected income sup-
port in various forms for those who
would be classiﬁed among the work-
ing poor.

“Second were people who were
interested in more regulation, or at
least maintaining the existing stand-
ards of regulation of business in a
variety of areas: health concerns,
labor safety, environmental protec-
tion, fair practices, the protection of
producers‘ markets, and so on.

“Those people I think quite clearﬁ

lost.

"But thetrend lines sit a little bit
earlier than this administration. This
administration, by the depth of its
belief and its administrative activity,
has done it much more substantially
and more ‘deeply than what might
have been done under another
administration. There's been a gen-
eral belief that regulatory practices
have tended to frustrate or inhibit
productive use of resources.

"Third is the education and
research complex, where there are
controllable expenditures to some
extent. The very visible part of it, the
cutting down of student loans, but it
runs even deeper than that.

“The administration has trﬂﬁ

cut out almost all government
research that they didn't see contri-
buting to a very deﬁnitive kind of pur-
pose. The National Science
Foundation is a basic science unit,
not an applied science unit.

“The administration has tried to

- cut out a lot of the direct research on

government.

“They imposed substantial cuts to
the Census Bureau, they cut out a lot

"I think that Reagan is going to
change his budget so that his public
image will improve. I think he's doing

thoserlittle things, going around, visit-

ing different places, making pop

ing up with these statements about
how he isn't against poor people.

"I think he's going to do that to
improve his public image, but I don't
think he's going to change his
budget to do any real help for poor
people.

"I had a conversation with a gentle

‘man who is a ﬁrm supporter of Rea-

people ‘hold-—that the Reagan
budget is what this country needs to
get back on its feet, to get private
industry back to producing, but they
forget that when Reagan ﬁrst took
office, his reason‘ for cutting social
programs was to balance the budget.
What they're forgetting is that while
he is cutting the social programs, he
is not balancing the budget.

"So he's not fulﬁlling his promise
and he's not doing what they think is
going to help this country.

“He hasn't shown any ability to bal-

huge. This is basic economics: if you
don't have a budget deﬁcit, or you
decrease your budget deﬁcit, that
leaves more money for private indus-

that. Interest rates are still high,
because the government is running
a big budget deﬁcit And if interest
rates have decreased, which I think
they have periodically, it’s because
we're having more unemployment.
"If you increase unemployment,
you're going to decrease inﬂation. I
don't know why that hasn't been
pointed out on the news. It really
makes me angry. It's great that he
can bring inﬂation down, but the
Democrats could’ve done that in the

"The analyses that I've done are on
the impact of the changes, or the
effects of the changes on recipients.
One of the things I think is most dis-
turbing in the changes last August is
that it makes it ﬁnancially unattrac-
tive for people to work.

"One of the principal chancles
was the elimination of something

called ‘thirty and a third.’ What ‘thirty ‘

and a third‘ was was part of legisla-
tion passed in 1967 that provided an
incentive for them to work
on welfare, provided an incentive for
them to work, in order to try and get
themselves eventually off of welfare.
"The Omnibus Budget Reconcilia-
tion Act eliminated that provision.
“People who have supported
themselves partially through work
and partially through welfare will be

at all and support themselves entirelv

on welfare. Their beneﬁts will be
reduced according to the amount
that they earn, but they will also have
additional work expenses. The com-
bination dt the reduction in benefits

plus the work expenses makes them _

worse off than if they didn't work at
all.

"I don't sense any groundswell in ,

Congress to change that (the Omni-
bus‘ Budget Reconciliation Act), it's
not clear to me that Congress as a
whole understands that But I do
think that in the next presidential
election it's going to be a very embar-

rassing thing for the Republicans to .

explain why it is that they have made
not working preferable to working."

How much ‘of a voice do Pitt faculty have in uni-

are any indication. It’s becoming increasingly clear
that at Pitt, fiscal considerations‘ far outweigh
faculty concerns for quality and caution.

tendency to blatantly ignore faculty opinions is its
handling of a report by a special faculty committee
that evaluated the geography department. l - ' L '

Between Forbes Avenue and
Schenley Park sits the massive Car-
negie Institute, black with the grime
of a Pittsburgh long past—when the
mills ran to capacity and the air was
a blanket of smoke. It was Andrew

, C\arnegie’s gift to the people and city

of Pittsburgh. Nearly a century after
the first stone was laid, it still domi-
nates_ the Oakland landscape,
which, by its very presence, ‘it
helped to develop.

Around it buildings began to
sprout—-The Hotel Schenley and,

Institute

on the site of the University’s Frick
Fine Arts Building, an ice skating
rink. The institute triggered every-
thing Oakland is today, according to
Bob Gangewere, Editor of Carnegie
Magazine since 1974. '
“The Institute sort of made every-
thing possible. Mary Schenley gave
‘ Schenley Park to the city about the
time all this stuff was built near the
institute, and Oakland suddenly
grew into the cultural center of the
city. It was, Gangewere added, “the
first civic center‘ in the nation.” I

Fromthe outset, Carnegie was ,

‘We’ve Got To

-   I-Iaiue  Magazine!’

\,l

_ It began as the whim of Carne-
gie Institute president Samuel

exclaimec'1:’,-.W§’ue got to have a
magazine.

In April of 1927, the magazine
materialized as the Bulletin of
Carnegie Institute; it was 32
pages and published 10 times a
year, wrote current editor
Robert J. Gangewere in the April
_1977 50th anniversary issue of
Carnegie Magazine.

Harden Church, who one day _ 9

pages a month, and more recent
issues have 48 pages. Recently,
the magazine changed over to a
new format. 7

“We went bi-monthly, six
times a year...instead of our orig-
inal 10 times a year. Originally we
followed" the school year. We
began publishing in September
and continued on through May.
There were no June/July
issues,” said Gangewere.

The magazine that Samuel
Church had to have is going
strong 55 years later with a new
format and an estimated reader-
ship of 30,000, nearly twice the
‘membership rate of the
magazine.

“We’re a magazine that has a .
' long shelf life,” said Gangewere. '
People don’t throw us away.”

Most of the magazine’s read-
ership is in the Pittsburgh area,
“but it's kept by art galleries and
museums around the world,”

“We’re a magazine’ that

ple don’t throw us away.”

has a long shelf life...P.eo-.

according to Gangewere.

As Gangewere wrote in the
1977 anniversary issue, Carne-
gie Magazine serves not only as
the-house organ of the institute
‘and itsresearch, but as a chroni-
cle of Carnegie Library, the
_beginning of Carnegie Institute
of Technology, and. Western
Pennsylvania.

As a house organ, Carnegie
Magazine goes to the members
and friends of Carnegie Institute.

“The difference between us
and a city magazine is that we
have the kind of house publica-
tion that’s paid for by the institu-
tion. We don’t have to compete
on the newsstand with anyone,’
said Genewere. ' '

Since its inception in 1927,
Carnegie Magazine has grown
and changed. In. 1942 the circula-
tion reached 6,000. In 1948 the a

publication exparided to 36"

Another change is the crea-
tion of a newletter designed to
promote the planned activities of
the Institute’s' museums, librar-
ies, lecture hall andmusic hall.
Originally, the newsletter was
part of Carnegie Magazine. A

The newsletter comes out six
times a year, the separated for-
mat “frees up the magazine for
dealing with stories” according
to Gangewere.

Not all the articles published in
Carnegie Magazine are about
the institute. Some are historical
pieces on Western Penn-
sylvania, and many are written
by Pittsburgh historians such as
James Van Trump.

Still, Gangewere stressed,
“The magazines main mission
is to. report on the work of the
institute. You'll never find
more than one or two articles

that are non-institutional."

interested in creating a multi-
purpose building like the Institute.
According to Gangewere, “he
wanted something that he could put
his stamp on, like Stanford or Bran-
deis had. Carnegie thought he’d try
an institute.”

The original building, housing the
Library, Museum of Natural His-
tory, and the Art Gallery, as well as
the Music Hall and the Lecture Hall,
is now used by the Library. “The
Children’s Room was the Fossil Col-

lection, the Pennsylvania Room was
an Art gallery,” said Gangewere.

Opened on November 5, 1895,
the Institute was a success. By 1897,
plans were under way for a costly
renovation and expansion. The orig-
inal building, facing the entrance to
Schenley Park, and the Music Hall
opening onto Forbes Avenue, were
to ‘be enlarged at the cost of
$3,600,000.

“The Institute—the original
Institute—was so successful that
Carnegie gave several millions more
to expand it. He built the Forbes,
Avenue Extension,” according to

~ Gangewere.

It is with the Extension, which
now contains the Museum of Natu-
ral History, that Gangewere
believes the Institute really began.

Also constructed during this
period was the. Bellefield Boiler
plant..“Eyen that was innovative,”
said Gangewere. “It was dangerous
then to put boilers in the buildings——
they blew up. So Carnegie built the
plant in the ‘ravine, in a separate

_ building.

“They built the Bellefield Boiler to
supply the Institute. But rapidly that

, changed, and today it serves most of

Oakland’s major institutions.”
It was with the 1904-1907 expan-
sion that the Institute became what

» it is today—two museums, a lecture

hall, a music hall, a library’ and a
cafeteria——all under one roof. By
1970, the Institute covered five
acres of ground.

— “The Library was the main library

in Oakland for many years,” con- '

tinued Gangewere. Before Pitt and
CMU built Hillman and Hunt Librar-
ies, students used Carnegie Library.
As a result, the library‘ has an exten-
sive science and technology section
on the third floor.

The Museum of Art, Carnegie
Institute, is “very famous; because
from the beginning, Andrew Carne-
gie wanted to bring fine art to Pitts-
burgh to prove that fine art and
democracy were compatible,” said
Gangewere.

Carnegie started the Carnegie
Internationals, art shows that
brought some of the finest talent of
the time to the city of Pittsburgh.

“The idea of having one great col-
lection selected by a jury was great
for its , time,” Gangewere said.
“Today, its a much more difficult
thing. There’s television, art maga-
zines‘ to compete with, and insu-
rance costs.”

Despite these drawbacks, ‘ow-..
ever, the Institute is planning
another Carnegie International for

the fall of 1982, around the third .

Thursday in October, which is,
according to Gangewere, “tradition-
ally our Founder-Patron’s day.”

It is also traditionally the begin-
ning of the cultural season at the
Institute. *

The Carnegie Internationals were
held every three years, beginning in

, <1-he Pitt-iNeiNs,‘ Wednesday, May 12, i932

1896, said Gangewere, “until they
were discontinued in 1971, when
Leon Arkus, ‘director of the
Museum of Art, decided to focus on
acquiring a few great artists.”

According to Gangewere, by the
time Arkus had retired in 1980, the
Museum of Art collection had
increased by forty per cent. It was
duringthis period that. the Scaife
Gallery was built. -

“The Art collection here is a very
fine small collection, strong in the
impressionists, and strong in works
of American art. One of Leon
Arkus’ criteria was that everything
in the place should show quality,”
said Gangewere.

The Museum of Natural History is t

a research museum that sends peo-
ple into the field. It is ranked number
six in the country, according to
Gangewere. ~ I

“It became famous because we
were the first to reconstruct an
entire dinosaur from bones. We

' made replicas and sent them to ten

world capitals, including Berlin and
Paris,” said Gangewere. _
As a result of its early expeditions,

the Museum of Natural History is »

home to many “type specimens,”
the first specimens classified and
named to designate a new species.
I Many of the type specimens are in
the fields of botany and paleontol-
ogy, and when an error is made, it_
disrupts the whole _world of
museums. 
“Recently,” according to Gange-

were, “we changed a head on one of.

our dinosaurs.” Commonly, known
as brontosaurus, the specimen was
a subject of a paleontological debate
years ago when a curator at the
Institute refused to put a head on
the skeleton.

‘(When you find the skeleton, you

‘ don’t often find it in one place. The

head——if you find one—could be fifty
feet away. _

“There were several heads to
choose from, and it was the subject

-could be 50 feet away.”

"When you find a skeletori

' you don’t often find it

in one I place. The

head-—'-if you find one—-

 

of a‘ debate between the Institute .

and a guy from Yale.”

After the curator died, a head was
finally put on the skeleton—the one
thought by the man from Yale to be
correct. ‘ ‘

“But recently our people found
through history andresearch that it
was the wrong head,” said Gange-
were. “We(Carnegie Magazine)
broke the story, and when we
changed our dinosaurhead, other
museums had to change theirs,be-

cause ours was the type specimen.” '

.The high ceilings, marble stair-
cases, and long wooden tables in
Carnegie Library may suggest an
atmosphere of uninterrupted
silence, but this is a far cry from
what really goes on inside.

Largely ignored by Pitt students
who have 17 other libraries from
which to draw information, Carne-
gie Library offer a large variety of
resources and reading materials. At
the central library in Oakland or at
one of its branches, the public has
access to books, periodicals,micro-
film, maps, records, cassettes, films,
lectures, computerized information
retrieval systems and much more at
little or no charge. " 1

Although Andrew Carnegie sup-
plied the funds to build the library in
1895, it is a publicly funded
institution. V

According to Public Relations
Director Lenore Bayus, “many peo-
ple think that Andrew Carnegie left
provisions for the continuing main-

tenance of the library, but actually,

it’s funded mostly by the city and
county, and to a smaller extent by
the state.” _, 1
Bayus goes on to say that the
library is actually a regional library
with 22 branches and three book-
mobiles. “District library consul-

tants on the library’s staff handle the.
PR and children’s activities for the:

branches.”

Carnegie Library also services 59
independent local libraries located
in the suburbs.

The downtown branch, conve-
nient for Pittsburgh’s business com-
munity, is devoted almost entirely to
business, offering free lectures and
films every week. “The activities are
always at’noon so that people can go
on their lunch hours,” said Bayus.

In addition, the business division
“carries movies, books, periodicals
and subscribes to many financial
services specifically geared to the
business community.”

Also, the staff can locate corpo-
rate information such as addresses,
products, officers and stock and
bond prices; they accept phone
inquiries and are always willing to
help those who come to the library
with questions. -

For those who need information
quickly, a computerized informa-
tion retrieval service is located on
the second ﬂoor of the central
library in Oakland, and in the busi-
ness branch downtown.

“The system contains things that
you would normally get out of a writ-
ten index, except that it’s quicker,”
said Bayus.

Although it contains approxi-
mately 100 sources, including The

New York Times information bank,

Bayus believes that “you’re better

\ off in many cases to go through the

regular printed indices.”

The librarian makes the decision
to use the system and actually calls
the information. Only the first five
minutes of use are free, since the
system is costly “to run.

Another unique aspect of Carne-
gie Library is its music and art
department. The music , division,
begun in 1938 to accommodate the
growingamount of music and music
literature, offers books and periodi-
cals covering diverse aspects of the
field, from the recording industry to
opera.

It also has a vocal index of the

songs in the library’s extensive infor-
mation file listing magazine articles,
newspaper clippings and booklets
related to music, and information
about music and musicians in the
Pittsburgh area.

“The music department is consi-
dered one of the top six in the coun-
try,” said Bayus. ,

The Pennsylvania division, adja-
cent to the music and art depart-
ment, is considered an historical
collection, but also has current
information on Pittsburgh, Allegh-
eny County, and the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania.

Genealogists, students and
authors take advantage of its large
collection of newspaper clippings,
and the historical Pittsburgh Photo-
graphic Collection, with its pre-
served photographs and negatives,
has proved invaluable.

The collections at Carnegie
Library are valuable, but more valu-
able are the services provided. Of

   

The contrast in the library reading rooms reflect the
at Carnegie Institute over the years.

  Library

particular interest to students is the
Job Information Center, located on
the first floor. This section contains
educational and career information
and a computerized Guidance Infor-

L mation System ‘(GIS).

However, Bayus warns‘ that GIS
“doesn’t really tie you up to a job,
but it will take a number of factors
that your’re interested in and tell
which jobs are suitable.” She added
“the system is geared toward upper
high school, lower college level stu-
dents, who are unsure of their
careers,” but GIS can be used by
anyone who wants information on
an occupation, college, graduate
school, or financial aid.

“It contains the same kind of thing
that would be in a college catalogue,
but it’s quicker and can give infor-
mation for several different col-

- leges,” said Bayus.

As are all the library’s services‘,
GIS is free, but an appointment
should be made to use it.

phlets about health care, as well as

Curious

B BARRY ZASLOFF
He hired Johnny Majors and
later Jackie Sherrill, a team that
guided Panther football teams to
eight bowl games in the last nine
years. Recently, he handed the
reigns to Foge Fazio, along with a
team destined to stand atop the pre-
season polls. He employed Roy
Chipman as basketball coach, who
has taken the Panthers to two con-
secutive NCAA tournaments and
into the prestigious Big East Con-
ference, where national rankings
loom just over the horizon.
. Now, after 14 years of construc-
the finishing
touches holding back the dynasty,-
Pitt Athletic Director Casimir Mys-
linski opts for an early retirement.
Curious. Curious enough that
“some have suggested that Mys-
. linski may have received a slight
push. Not brute force, the theory
goes, just a polite tap on the
shoulder and a soft voice saying,
“Sorry, but we’d really like some-
one a bit younger with a little more
spunk. iWe need some more
charisma.”

There are signs to support the
theory. To begin, the hastily called
news conference a coupleweeks
back in which Myslinski formally
announced his retirement.

Press members received enough

,' Peculiar,

notification to gulp down the
remains of lunch and to reach
Forbes Quadrangle in time for
Myslinski’s opening comments.

Upon entrance, reporters were
questioning each other, wondering
what wasthe big news. A hefty sur-
prise indeed, only adding to the
curiosity. Usually retirement is a
long process involving considera-
ble thought and discussion.
Strange, that press members knew
nothing of Myslinski’s plans.
that it happened so
suddenly. ’

And there is more:

0 Dean Billick's promotion from
sports information director to asso-
ciate athletic director, giving him
almost as much power as
Myslinski. \

o Billick and Jack Freeman,
Pitt's senior vice chancellor for
administration, playing a more
visible role lately in major decision
making in athletics

O Freeman was deeply involved
in the discussions over the possible
formation of a College Football
Association (CFA) last summer.

0 At a lunche'on of the schools
involved with the CFA, it was Free-
man who represented Pitt.

o Billick’s handling of Pitt's
entrance into the Big East.

0 The talks surroiinding a possi-
ble Eastern League and the CFA
discussions, several times without
Myslinski’s presence.

0 At the Big East press confer-
ence, Billick, Chipman and Free-
man spoke, Myslinski didn't.

And Myslinski’s retirement
speech sounded a tadtoo simple.

“I really want the chance to do
some things at a less demanding
pace,” he said. “I haven’t had a
vacation in several years and I just
want some time off to relax. A

“I was thinking" about retire-
meni from the first distasteful day
o_r_i__the job when I said to myself;
“How can I getout of here?"

Why didn't Myslinski take his
vacations? Surely he was entitled.
Maybe he just enjoyed his job, the
kind of employee you have to drag
out on a stretcher. Or-perhaps he
was too preoccupied with building
a dynasty, but in the midst of it an
early retirement? -

How does Freeman answer all of
the accusations; “No inside story
here. I think hejust ‘wanted to stop
and smell the roses.”

Perhaps. But then again all roses
eventually wilt, and when they do
their owners usually replace them
with vounger ones with more life.

By -BRIAN BALK

All evidence points toward a pre-
season ranking of No. l for the Pitt
football team. Returning are 18 of
last years 22 starters, a defensive
line as talented as many pro teams,
and All-American quarterback

Dan Marino taking snaps from
center.
iHowever, statistics do not win
games. ‘
So, the Panthers actively illus-

trated their talent to pre-season

pollsters ‘in the recent Blue and
Gold intersquad game, marking

the end of spring practice, and
solidifying the Panthers’ claim toa
No. 1 ranking. ‘
The Blue team emerged victor-
ious with a 43-0 slaughter over the
Gold, which was expected since
Head Coach Foge Fazio purposely
grouped both first team offense and

v nuity among

defense on the Blue Squad.

“I wanted to give both first teams
the opportunity to get the feel of
playing together,” Fazio
explained.

This was the first time the conti-
the offense and
defense was ever attempted in ‘Pitt's
annual intersquad game. And the
first team, Blue, gave an accurate
picture of just what the Panthers’
will look like in top form-—
awesome! i

The Blue team's offense was led

by Marino, whose performance.

prompted Fazio to say, “Danny’s
already in mid-season form." This
was obvious from the 193 passing
yards and three aerial touchdowns.

An offensive performer who sur-
prized many was sophomore Mar-
lon McIntyre. Mclntyre, who filled
Wayne DiBartola's vacated ‘tail-
back position ran for 51 yards. No
doubt Mclntyre can run, but he has
also procurred another valuable

y offensive asset—blocking.

“Marlon did a great job block-
ing, which was a difficult adjust-
ment when he first made’ the
transition to tailback," explained
Fazio. . ’

McIntyre’s progress was so out-
standing that he was nained the
recipient--along with defensive
back I)an “Peep" Short—of the Ed
Conway Memorial Award, given to
the most improved offensive and
defensive players in the spring
football drills.

Having a player of Marino’s size
playing quarterback, it would
seem that a back-up would be
unnecessary. However, the nature
of the game dictates otherwise, an(l
it looks like soplioinore' John
(lummings, who possesses a rifle
arm. and who completed three of
seven passes for 31 yards, will fill
the l)ill.

Fazio is pleased with the poten-
tial the rarely used Cummings has
shown. “We are very much

impressed with his ability to throw ’

  .Panthers   Awesome In Blue-G old   Game   

the ball. However, he lacks the
maturity——-his only hang-up is that
he’ has to be more forceful on the

field-7he has to learn to take’

chars:-” . ~. . . .
Fazio said his intention of this

game was to create every possible
playing situation that the Panthers
could encounter during the regular
season. One unique situation,
which put the Panther offensive
squad to the test, was a 55 yard field
goal attempt._With the aid of Mark
Schubert's explosive leg, the ball
fell between the uprights, nipping
the base pole, but, nonetheless was

good for three noints, 
Yielding only 61 yards, Pitt’s No.
l defense was in top shape. Fazio

emphasized that a healthy Panther

squad should field a strong and
dominating defensive line that
could be almost impermeable.
“We'll have four linebackers
nobody in the country can crack.”

-“Chris Doleman has shown
great improvement, ‘and Tom
Flynn could be one of the premier

free safeties in the country,” noted . ,

F

Michael “I)og" Woods, stating
that “a lot of pro scouts are telling
me that No. 96 (Woods) is a minia-

, ture Hugh Green." .

Presently, the only key element
missing from a yNo. 1 team is a
healthy roster. The Panthers ranks
are riddled with several injuries.
Paul Dunn is out with a torn cartil-
age in his knee, “Yogi" Jones is
hampered by a chipped bone in his
wrist, and Art Lowery with knee

problems. _ _
“Going into fall camp I think

we’ll all be healthy," Fazio opti-
mistically speculated.

With «l0 seconds left in the
annual classic, the scoreboard dis-
played a phrase which sums up the
players‘ as well as the fans’ senti-
ments about Panther football. it
read, “CAN'T WAIT I TILL
FALL." -

“I think we’ll be ranked in the

about other teams and how they
are doing,” said Marino.
When asked ifa No. l ranking

_ was possible, Julius Dawkins

arrived at the same conclusion
as Sir Isaac Newton did over 100
years ago—“Momentum"—-—it is
a vital aspect in moving ahead.
Dawkinsiput Newton's theory
of inertia in today's football
teams, saying, “We first have to
get the rhythm of winning.
Once we get that momentum,
there will be no stopping usl”

Safety Tom Flynn also down-
plays the No. l label. “Sure it
would be an honor to be ranked
No. l, but it doesn’t really mean
that much. They'll all be after
us, because they know were out
to step on a lot of toes," Flynn
explained.

Along with the prestige of
No. I is the multiplied fear of
other opponents aggressive
drives. Teams from Slippery
Rock State to USC would toil
twice as hard to upset a No. l
squad. Sophomore Bill Fralic’s

prime concern Is not letting
other team’s excessive drives
“get” to the Panthers.

“We have to keep our heads
together and remember what it
took to get to the top, he said. It
is important that we eliminate
mental lapses——that‘s where we
can lose."

To compensate for “sky-
high‘,' opponents bent on
upending Pitt, Fralic plans to
strenghten his intensity in the
game. If he has his say—so.
nobody will pull the astro turi
from underneath the Panthers’
spikes-.

Defensive end Tim Lewis said
that it will take a lot of hard
work to reach and maintain a
No. 1 spot. “It’s going to take a
lot of hard work to be a national
champion because everyone
will be shootingyfor us."

In the Pitt football team’s eyes
though, there is only one
appropriate ranking digit for
next fall-No. pl. ‘

Have you ever watched a horror
movie and later that night had
niglitinares? Well, last night after
wattliing the Pirate gaine I had a
dream. I wasn't a sports writer any-
more. and I couldn't understand
the r‘ornnientator's jargon used
during the game.

I think it all started when one of
the aiiiiouiieers said: “the
infielders are playing halfway." At
first, I wasn't sure if he meant half-
way between Pittsbiirgli and llous-
ton, wliith would put them
somewhere near Crab ()rr‘hard,
Tennessee, and I couldn't figure
out why anyone would want to be
there. Then I tried to figure out
where the infielders would be if
they were only one-fourtli of the
way. ()r for that matter, all of the
way. After deciding they were in
Crab ()1’(‘l12lF(l, I turned my atten-
tion to the offensive aspect of the
sport, where in one at bat, an Astro
“stroked" a “payoff pitcli" that
()iiiar Moreno “cainped under"
before “liauling it in." I t'ouldn't
figure out why anyone would want
to pitch a tent in the Las Vegas

llton.

" llie next hatter "slapped one" to
right field, but 1l(‘(‘()I‘(llllg' to Pirate

Game Time
Changed

With networks competing for
the television rights of NCAA col-
lege football. come schedule

changes for the sake of conven-
ience. Pitt has moved the Pitt-
North Carolina game, previously
slated for Sept. 18 to Sept 9 to
accommodate CBS and prime
time teIevision.Air time will be
9 p.m.

Pitt has also announced that the
Sept. 4 game against Florida State
has been moved to the evening of
Sept. 18, making the Pitt-North
Carolina game the first televised
game of the year. The game site is
still undetermined.

Pitt has the option of playing at
either Three Rivers Stadium, since
the Pirates have offered their total
cooperation, or playing at Pitt Sta-
dium if lights can be installed
between now and the game date.

Speculation has it that CBS
offered Pitt $700,000 to televise the

game,

outbidding ABC by
$200,000.

Boxers
Injured

It’s getting so that boxers are
safer inside the ring rather than
outside of it.

First, it was the postponementof
the March 15 bout between WBC
Heavyweight Chanpion Larry
Holmes and the number one con-
tender Gerry Cooney. Prior to the
bout, Cooney suffered an injury to
his shoulder delaying the highly
publicized title fight until June 11.

Next came the scheduled May 24

BASEBALL

The Pirates and the Pitt baseball
team have several things incom-
mon: both are strong hitting teams,
both have ineffective pitching
staffs and both are under the .500
mark in 1982.

While the Bucs are leading the
National League in batting, the
Panthers (10-18) aren’t too shabby
themselves. Nine players are hit-
ting over .300 including first base-
man Tony LaCava, who leads the
Eastern Athletic Association in
batting.

However, it’s said that good
pitching beats good hitting and
Pitt does not have the strong
hurlers of the past seasons. Still,
though the teams earnedrun aver-
age is hovering over five per game,
there have beensome noteworthy
performances. Freshman Tom
Seebacher assumed the role as the
stopper, leading the squad in wins
and is seventh in the EAA earned
runs allowed. Sophomore left-
hander Bob Myers is also a top 10

The Pitt News, Wednesday, May 12, I362

EAA pitcher, despite having a
hard-luck 1-4 record.

Forget the present and look to
the future for Pitt baseball. With 20
returning freshman and sopho-
mores and with a year of collegiate
baseball under their belts, the
Panthers——who finished up the

season——have reason to be
optimistic. ’
TENNIS

After nine matches, the Pitt

Panther tennis team stood a disap-
pointing‘2-7. Certainly their goal
of reaching .500 seemed improba-
ble, if not impossible. But the
Panthers gained momentum, con-
fidence and experience en route to a
five match winning streak, earning

‘them a 7-7 mark.

Coach George Dieffenbach
explained that the team jelled at
the right time, saying that, “People
started to progress and improve.
They gained rhythm and expe-
rience, and they became much
more aggressive.”

Dieffenbach said, “Several play-

Sports Roundup

ers were the key to the team's late-

season success, most notably senior
Captain Steve Berkovitz." Berko-
vitz, named the team's most valua-
ble player, began winning in the
number three spot while combin-
ing with D.]. Mariano, a transfer
from Duquesne, in the number two
doubles position.

jamie McDonald, the top singles
player, “started to win” while the

number one doubles team of
McDonald and Larry Lederer
“started to click,’’ Dieffenbach
added.

‘‘All of the guys contributed," he
said. “It was a team effort.”

The key to the comeback was a
close 5-4 decision over Carnegie
Mellon and the Highpoint was a
9-0 pasting of Gannon in the sea-
son finale. Other ‘wins came
against Robert Morris (twice) and
Westminster.

Dieffenbach had considerable
praise for his assistant coaches who
molded a group of non-
scholarship tennis players into a
solid team.

“I give a lot of credit to my staff,”

NURSES=

Dieffenbach said. “They did a great
job."

With eight lettertnen returning.
the Panthers should return as a
strong team next year when they
enter competition in the Big East
tournament this fall.

MEN'S TRACK

Ask Pitt’s Darren Geary how
close three-hundredths of a second
is. That was the margin of defeat he
suffered to Penn State's Mike Cook
in the john Woodruff Invitational
800—meter run, during the Pitt Out-
door Track Invitational held last
weekend at Pitt Stadium.

Cook won the race named after
the only Pitt athlete ever to win a
gold metal in the Olympic Games,
with a time of 1:05.33. Cook’s team-
mate Ken Wynn finished third
behind Geary with a time of
1:50.66.

Derrick Reynado repeated as the
most valuable athlete in the invita-
tional, winning the 200 (20.84) and
400 (47.27) meter runs. Kevin
Atkins of Ohio State was the only
other double winner, heaving the
discus (178-3) and the shot put (58-
4).

Eastern Kentucky’s Ken Glover
broke the meet and stadium record
in the high jump (7-2‘/6) and Kent
State’s Chuck McCullough set a
new record in the hammer throw
(212-1). Maryland’s Vince Reilly
tied the -high jump record of 16-1.

Roger Kingdom was the only
Pitt winner in the invitational, tak-
ing the 110-meter hurdle with a
14.07. Other top performances
among the Panthers came from

‘‘It was a successful meet,"
Coach Mike Agonstinella said.
“We did pretty well.” .

The Panther track team will next
see action Friday at the Penn Sate
Open, which Agostinella predicts
will be “a good and interesting
meet.”

WOMEN’S TRACK

A slogan for the Marines is “a
few good men." An appropriate
slogan for the Pitt Lady Panther
track team is “a few good women.”
Despite the lack of numbers on the
team, Coach Elbert Kennedy has
two outstanding performers,

which was evident at the Eastern 5

Association women’s track meet
held last weekend at T owson Sate
College,

Senior Peri Radecic defended her
discus title with a throw of 144 feet
4'/2 inches while freshman Renee
Henderson won the 200-meters
with a time of 23.9 and took second
in the 100 meter run (11.8). Both
times were new school records.

Both Radecic and Henderson
will participate in the Women's
Intercollegiate championships

sity in Clarksville Tennessee.

By KEVIN TURRENTINE

It's certainly not artistic. In fact,
sometimes it has been downright
ugly. It’s not usually high scoring.
But there has always been a hero be
it Clyde Vaughn, B.B. Flennory,
Bruce Atkins or Sam Clancy. It is
the Duquesne-Pitt basketball
rivalry.

Until this past weekend,
fierce rivalry between these two
teams was feared to have come to an
end...again. The Duquesne-Pitt
series had once been cancelled due
to pre- and post-game brawls
between players and fans. The
rivalry had been re-initiated when
the Eastern 8 League was formed in
1976.

When Jim Satalin was
appointed head coach of Duquesne
just a little over a month ago, there
remained the question: “will the
Duquesne-Pitt series continue now
that Pitt had abandoned the East-
ern 8 for the prestigious Big East?”

Satalin felt it in Duquesne’s best
interest if the game was alway
played at the Civic Arena. The
Arena, which seats 16,000, is consi-
dered by many a neutral court for
Pitt and Duquesne although it is
the site for Duquesne home games.
Satalin used the Civic Arena’s seat-
ing capacity (seats 9,000 more than
the Pitt Field House) as the premise
for his argument.

Meanwhile, Pitt coach Dr. Roy
Chipman became frustrated with
the whole issue. “I’m aggravated
by all of this. We had a date set and
they’re reneging on it. I want to
play Duquesne. The only reason
the game won’t be played is if
Duquesne does not want to play it
and I want the people of Pittsburgh
to know that.”

Satalin countered saying,
want to play Pitt. He (Chipman)
wants to paint me as the big, bad
guy coming into town, and it's not
that way at all. I just think the
game belongs to the people of
Pittsburgh, and more people can
watch the game if it’s played at the
Arena.”

If you’re a Coach Satalin fan you
must believe that more people will
be watching the game this upcom-
ing season. Duquesne and Pitt
have agreed to a “home and home"
series. The site of the Pitt-
Duquesne game for the upcoming

season is the Civic Arena. 'Tht;,J

game is slated for November 30th.
Pitt Field House will be the site for
the game during the 1983-84
season.

The spirits of Sam Clancy, Bruce 1

Atkins and B.B.Flennory can rest
easy now.

Pitt volleyball Coach Ray Reil-
ley had few complaints after his
team fell victim to stiff competition
in the Eastern Collegiate Volley-
ball League Championships held
at Pitt earlier this month. A

“I was pleased with the team’s
play, especially against Rutgers ‘
(Newark) who is ranked ninth in
the nation. The match lasted three
hours, which left us physically and

A 1th George Mason.”

George Mason disposed the
Panthers l5—l0, 15-12, ending Pitt’s
dream of a trip to nationals. Top-
seeded Penn State finished the
tournament undefeated (6-0) with a
15-5, l5—9 victory over Rutgers and
will advance to the National Vol-
leyball Championship.

The Panthers placed three play-
ers on the All—Iiast team: David
Baird, Bill Knuth and Gary
Groshner. Baird, a ‘junior setter,
was named first team All~l£ast
player for the second consecutive
year.

For Knuth, also a junior, it was
his first All-East nomination.
i:ﬁ()lI1()I’(‘ Gary Groshner was
tiaznetl to the All-East second team.

All three players return next
year, giving Reilley just reason
enough to express optimism. “We
hope to move up to second in the
East, he said.

All but one letterman——senior
Brian Divine——w‘ill return. The
loss of Divine will leave a gap at the
mid—hlocker position, which Reil-
ley plans to fill with freshman
recruits.

By CHRISTOPHER APIPLEGATE

Once upon a time poetry and thea-
tre were linked inextricably together.
The greatest theatres the world has
ever known, those of Fifth Century
Greece and Elizabethan England,

'%ave been fusions of the actor's art

and the poet's. When you add; the
verse dramas created by the play-

wrights of Spain's Golden Age, those ,

of the French Neo—Cla’ssical period,
and by the German sturm and drang
poets Goethe and Schiller, you have
an overwhelming history of success-
ful collaboration between these art
forms. ‘

Yet poetry in the drama has not '
fared very well in our century. T.S.
Eliot wrote plays in free verse that in
performance were indistinguishable
from prose. Maxwell Anderson's

_  . work seems dated and self-conscious
"W , » *,
today; only Christopher Fry seems to

have been able to make the connec-
tion ;work, at least in English.
A play based primarily, therefore,

. on the work of the enigmatic Ameri-

can poet Sylvia Plath would seem to
be a surefire turkey if ever there was

one. And nothing could be further
from the truth. 7 T
If you doubt this, spend an evenin

P at the Pittsburgh Laboratory Thea-‘
‘ tre's production of Sylvaia Plath: A

matir Portrait. Kate Royston has fash-
ioned Plath's words and the voices
and bodies of three exceptional
actresses intoa performance of over-

,powering dramatic intensity.

Royston’s direction has a deftness»
and sure—handedness that is nothing
short of stunning. The two keys to
her work are its innate simplicity and
its seemingly inexhaustible variety.

The stage environment is primarily
empty space. As you enter the thea-
tre, you are confronted. with a red-
washed cyclorama flanked by black
drops; rectangular set pieces are
stacked in three formations, like the
building blocks of some giant child;
Gato Barbieri’s lyrical yet rough-
edged tenor saxaphone dancesover
the sound system.

In performance, Royston’s
actresses command the space with
easy energy. Theylmove sometimes
like cats, sometimes like ethereal
beings. Sometimes ‘they dramatize
the work, as in their fine ensemble

P Patricia

\

playing of the archly humorous ”The
Mother Union;” at other times they
become different aspects of the same
personality, as if the poet were
engaged in a dialogue with herself.-
And at times they have the sense to
remain still, to allow only the power
of their facial expressions and their
voices to communicate the meaning

‘of Plath’s words. And always, they

bring a visceral dimension to the
poet's sometimes too fragile verse
that is a veritable revelation.

Janet Robb is gutsy and in full com-
mand of voice, body, and ‘material.
Grace, a dark,” willowy
beauty of an actress with searchlight
eyes, moves with the deliberate assu-
rance of a gazelle and plays with
highly sensitive emotional
resonance. J '

But the finest work is that of Caryl
Opshinsky, no mean achievement in
the afore—mentioned company.
Opshinsky has the energy of a blast
furnace and a surprisingly powerful
voice (this despite a minor speech
defectwhich is noted, accepted, and
promptly forgotten.) Robb’s firm,
mature acting links her in our minds
with the assertive, strong aspect of

“O r
- rtrait

     

  
 
 

‘Plath’s nature she rarely displayed;
the fragile beauty of Grace's work
identifies -her with Plath as a child and
as a child-woman. Opshinsky, how-
ever, succeeds in- integrating the
many subtle layers and_ Conflicting.
impulses of Plath’s personality and
art, and renders the most complate
portrait in this Plath: Portrait. A"

David Chesnet's lighting is superb,
and perfectly in tune with Roystonfs»
intentions. It is eloquent yet never
intrusive; note the simple impact he-
achieves during "Daddy.”

On the negative side, there are
occasional pacing problems and the
piece sometimes becomes momentar-
ily static, particularly during
”Tulips." ‘

Sylvia Plath: /i Dramatic Portrait ranks
hands—down among the season's best
and most imaginative productions. It
runs "at PLT through April 25, and
reservations may be made at 621-
2876. If you are an admirer of Plath’s
work, it isan absolute must-see; if
you are not, Portrait will very likely
convert you.

  

 

By WALTER WATSON

' TheCit.y Theatre Company's pro-

duction of Loose Ends is a delightful and
hauntingstory of love between two
people and the couple's interaction
with family and friends. Loose Ends is a
delight to watch because of the
warmth, humor and depth the play-
ers bring to their characters. The
experience of falling in and out of
love is effortless, so natural for the
performers; their conviction — and
motivations are crystal clear tothe
audience. .

Loose Ends takes place during the
decade of the 1970's. It is only set
during the period as happenstance,
since the questions addressed are, in
fact, timeless subjects for most. Paul
(played by John_ Hall) and Susan
(played by Holly Thuma) are the main
characters, and their lives are opened
to us through the witnessing of inti-
mate conversations, talk of plans to
become successful individuals willing
to share their lives with each other
and friends.

times, insecure, at times, impulsive
Paul is given with affecting sensitiv-

 City and high-pitched intensity. And,
although Holly

Thuma's Susan
seems to be making a strong argu-
ment for the importance of having a
private life and one to share with oth-
ers, she pulls off the sentiment well-

such charm and power that the ‘idea
almostlsounds new. __ '
Director Larry John Meyers effec-
tively takes the audience and his cast
through psychological and emotional
climates with the sights and sounds
of Bali, New York City, Boston, and
New Hampshire. As years pass with
each scene, it is easy to see the
changes in the ‘characters, as well as
the proper sense of both. the ideals
that bring. together, and the reality
that threatens to split up the play’s

A principals. V J A
The problems faced by the smaller -

characters throughout run very close
to the decisions that Susan and Paul
must resolve in their relationship.
This play, about living with and lov-
ing another person, as well as the
depression, -joy, and uncertainty that
attaches to those decisions, rings
true. It is a love story that promises to
leave audiences with revelations and
absurdities that are often missed in
the hectic activity of most American
lives.

If you were always sent to the little

left to daydream about what the
grown ups were talking about, wond-
ering when you would be old enough
to join their hallowed presence, then
you know all about the rites of the
American dining table. James
Lapine's Talrle Settings is a delightful
commentary on the American family
as it contemplates dinner, love and
life, and The Pitt Studio Theatre does
full justice to the play.

Cut into dozens and dozens of little
vignettes, which paint a portrait of

table at Thankgiving and Christmas, _

the.American familvwat its best and‘

worse, Table Settings boasts a light-
hearted production, and terrific per-
formances by the seven member cast.
The entire cast is funny and compell-
ing, but special attention mustJgo to
David'C. Neal, the younger son who
has a wickedly cynical attitude about
life, his father, Matt Messinger, who
prefers communicating through
martinis, his serenely happy wife, Jo-
Ann DeAngelo, and everybody's well
meaning Jewish grandmother, Caryn
R. Ronis, who has only one wish in
life—that her family EAT MORE!

Table Settings runs through this Sat-

it, after dinner of course.

By C.M. WILTANGER

The best thing about Paul Schrad—. ‘

er's Cat People is that it stars Natassia
Kinski instead of Pia Zadora, and
David Bowie makes the end worth
the wait. .

Promotedas the year's most erotic _

fantasy film, this remake of the 1947
B-classic has only one thing other
than Bowie's theme song going for
it—and that's neither the acting nor

the plot. Kinski is so childishly inno- if

cent as the lost waif who comes (after

years of foster homes) tolive with big '

brother Malcolm McDowell in New
Orleans that she could be accused of
child porn but not acting. Neither

she, McDowell, nor John Heard (as

the zoo curator Kinski falls in "heat"
with) consider acting~as they mutter

what must be some of the screen's T
._ mostinsipid lines (”Do you _know

what keeps alligators away?" the
friendly Heard rnutters as he nuzzles
Kinski’s neck in the middle of a

"swamp. "What?" sheiycoos’. "Making
love,"' he replies huskily.)

 

 

Barf——something the leopards do a
lot of in this movie. .
The plot is thin. Brother and sister

a share an ancient cursethat renders

them "sexually unsafe with anyone
other than each other. Kinski’s inno-

.cent character, (she's so innocent she

confesses-—to a woman she's known
for all of five minutes'—-that she's still
a virgin), and McDowell's "cat—like"
grace-—(he's_out of shape and begin-
ning to resemble Karl Malden) are
unconvincing and show that this film
is not only a study of obvious
miscasting——though Kinski is more

‘like a cat than McDowell——but in lack’
of continuity as well. It's as if the.

movie_was edited to be two, hours,
making some of the scenes obvious

-loose ends.

In the beginning, McDowell is
wearing a lay—deacon's collar, and

later Kinski shows up at the rectory
where he has an office, butnothing

more is said orshown to give a clue as
to why that's in there. ln amovie ripe
with Freudian overtones, a lay-
deacon who turns into a pantherand
eats prostitutes has got to be deve-

-  

   

loped. Obviously Schrader didn't see
it that way.

While Cat People isn't as openly-sex- I A

ist as the garden variety terrorize-
'em-before-you-kill—'em flicks of
current popularity, the ‘macho fanta-
sies still ring tried and true. Kinski’s
character, is all her supposed school-

. girl innocence and modesty, wears no

underwear, owns only themost inno-

cent of sh_eer (see-through) blouses,
and willingly submits herself to bon-

dage so as not to maul Heard as he
makes love to her. is nothing com-
pared to‘the "sex is death" theme.
And even though a male zoo keeper
has his arm ripped from his bo‘dy, the
references to the ‘mauled bodies of
female prostitutes with their genitals
eaten out tells the.whole Story.

As bad as it is, it strikes me that Cal
People had a lot of potential. The one
good thing about the film'(other than
Bowie's song) is cinematography—
unrivalled in ,a fantasy genre, and
equal to The Black Stallion and Raiders’ of
the Lost Ark. But beauty couldn't save

the beast and it can't save this dog. As »

it stands, Cot People, supposedly an
erotic film, resembles more the lush

KIM WILDE
Kim Wilde
EMI America

You would expect the daugh-
ter of a veteran English rocker
to utilize all of her talent and her

father's experience in her debut

album. Which she did. ‘Kim
Wilde's long-awaited U.S.
release of her already-popular
British lp seems to have the
recipe for success in this coun-
try. lt’s easy to guess what the
major ingredient is if yo_u check
out her pictorial in March's
issue of THE FACE. Kim, attrac-
tive both on film and in print,
has received much of the recent
British media coverage, and if
this trend continues here she
will undoubtedly sell more
albums. The fact that her father
is Marty Wilde may bring on a
few more buyers, especially
since his career had declined
permitting his total devotion to
his children's musical endea-
vors. Kim's younger brother
Ricky has a career of his own
and produced her‘ album,
Brother .and father also wrote
all of the songs, but, despite this

family involvement, the album»

centers on Kim.

Kim Wilde has an amazing
talent for capturing the ear of
her listeners. She ‘plays none of
the instrumental tracks
(although she plays piano anda
little guitar), but her delivery of
the vocal tracks creates the
carefree, trendy, jet-set feeling
this album evokes. ”Young
Heroes" is a good example of the
beachy r&b/ rockabillyish style
that Kim is so comfortable with.
Her use of self-harmonization a
’la David Bowie adds the
expected Beach Boy-like har-
mony in a fashionable manner.
Songs like ”Water On Glass”
and "Chequered Love") demon-
strate her brother’s producing’
talent as he mixes very profes-
sional instrumental tracks. in
perfect accompaniment to his
sister's singing. This album is
energetic and hard rocking-‘—a
good combination for the enter-
tainment of the record buying
public. Kim Wilde's debut
attempts to combine this with
her charisma and beauty to
ensure the support of the Kids
in America.

ECHOES OF AN ERA
Various Artists
Elektra/Asylum

For those of you who keep lis-
tening in vain to top 40, waiting
for something really good; for
those of you who went to dis-
cos, not because you ‘enjoy
wearing lycra pants and
sequined vests, but because
there was something familiar
about the danceable» beat; for
those of you who know that
there are musical instruments

‘ other than those forever tied to

an electrical umbilical cord‘,
break your piggy banks, roll
those pennies and buy Echoes of
an Era. What you get is the best

_ old-time jazz performed by the

best contemporary jazz artists.
The album is a collection of

T some of the best jazz standards '

(”Take the A Train," "All of
Me,” ”Them Eyes") performed
by Freddie Hubbard, Ioe Hend-
erson, Chick Corea, Stanley»
Clarke, Lenny White and —
surprisingly--Chaka Khan.

Each artist turns in their usu-
ally brilliant performance on the
album. Chaka Khan is the only
surprise on the album. She
imitates the style and sound of
her’ childhood ' favorites, Ella
Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday
without sounding false. But, I
don't think Chaka has the con-
trol or the pure vocal style of
her old idols. Still, she does
some fair interpretations,“ of
these standards.

What can you say about the
others? They're as tight, as tal-
ented, as expert as ever. And if
you think that much talent can't
combine into satisfying whole,
ever drink a kamikaze?

LET THE FOUR WINDS

Tenpole Tudor

Stiff

Now that Rockpile no longer
exists, Tenpole Tudor seems

like the appropriate band to step

into their shoes. A group of
straight—forward rockers with a
rockabilly backbone hidden
under suits of armor (their
image is Medieval) Tenpole
Tudor's main concern seems to
be fun——just like Rockpile's used
to be. '
Lead singer is Eddie Tudor
who became the English punks’
cult hero of the month when he

sang ”Who Killed Bambi?" in

The Great Rock And Roll Swindle. If '

Let The Four Winds Blow is a fair
indicator, it seems fair to say
that Tudor generates as much
excitement on vinyl as he does
in concert, where he's said to be
an extraordinarily kinetic per-
former, given to graceless
athleticism that looks crippling.
All of side one's a winner with ‘

"Throwing My Baby Out With

The Bath Water." (a raver you'd
swear was written by Nick
Lowe) and ”What You Doing In
Bombay?/' a 60's dance
stomper, standing out just a
nose ahead of the rest. Side two
is a bit more poppish, with the
exotic "The King of Siam" steal-
ing the show ’ as the album's

closer.

another British band getting
exposure in a country that pays

» little attention to its own talent,
. and even if they wear Medieval

clothes (ever get the feeling that
England's just one big costume
store.7). Let The Four Winds Blow is
still worth buying——if every-
thing they do is this good, they
could wear bunny suits for alll
care!‘

ing hard-rock bandsiare staying
on the market. Witness Scor-
pions: this group of musicians
(that's what they call them-
selves) have put out another
album full of senseless crap.

The guitars, drums, bass, and
vocals (screams) clash, instead

of blending, to give the most ‘

unbearable noise. The songs
deal with sex, drugs, and rock &
roll; too bad all are glorified in a
cheap sense.‘

Enough about the record——
now for the cover: The jacket
has the most inhumane drawing
ever seen. A screaming man
with his head swathed in ban-
dages and forks digging into his
eye sockets. So much for an
attractive package. '

The only problem with
reviewing an album like this is
most of the people whohwould
buy it cannot read. They're too
busy bashing their brains out

I'm sorry, truly sorry I ever

Greg Kihn should be tarred and
feathered for ever releasingthis
trash, especially after last years

All of the songs are dull,
tedious, ‘horrendous, etc. And
the band sounds uninspired, if
not depressed. Even Kihn’s
singing is rotten. No wonder,
with songs like ”Sound Sys-

BEACH BOYS
Stanley Theatre
March 25, 1982

By TODD ERKEL

Call it bizarre!

Stoned adults who probably
haven't been out of the house in
months—they were this night's
model. "Hey, toss that ball over
here!" Bodies were strewn
everywhere. Talk about crazy———
I had to check my ticket—this
couldn't be a ‘ Beach .Boys
concert?!

What the audience repre-
sented, although my naive
expectations prevented ‘me
from seeing it, was a window.
The view it offered was that of a

desolate road on which the

‘Beach boys—their music, their
image, and their followers——
now dwell. A
Twenty years in the business
is hard time but longevity
doesn't excuse the sort of unin:
spired, unprofessional mockery
the Beach Boys staged at The

Stanley. The fact that most of ~
the crowd loved it is no" penance '

either—it’s only an excuse for
reviewers like myself to pound
their head into the nearest wall.

They loved Mike Love, his
feeble, whiney voice, his boring
chauvinistic pander, his sniff!

sniff! s.niff! "Ah, what about

them Steelers?" charm. Come
on, the man is obnoxious!
They loved Brian "I no longer
fit into cabs" Wilson, his grow!-
ing attempts at singing, his
sullen stare out into mid-space,
his periodic "naw naw naw, I

donn wanna" refusals to play.
Brian Wilson on cigarettes and
beer, let's hear it for Brian?
Wake up folks, six wimpy
blondes from California just
robbed you of $13.50. You can
recapture the feeling of this
concert by imagining yourself
waking out of a deep sleep, only
to find yourself in a room filled
with strangers. The T.V. is
blasting out one of those com-
mercials we've all grown to love:

”That's right, 20 of your favor-»
ite Beach Boys hits on two i

albums, eight—tracks or
cassettes.”

With the demise of Love and
Brian Wilson, the band is rot-
ting at the core. The material is

infectious—tha,t can't be denied,

but its packaging in a homogen-
ized, quick-assembled series of
medlies makes you wonder why

they didn't just send a video out
on. the road and stay at home to
catch a few rays. Even the Beach
Boys’ attempt at deafening the
audience with excessive decibels

couldn't disguise them from the

mediocre entertainers they've
become.

If you're thinking that quasi- !

underground, bent—on-new-
ideas magazines such as this
have come and gone while the
Beach Boys have endured,
you're right. The Beach Boys’
talents have long outlived those
whom, from the group's incep-
tion, have preyed on this type of
virginal rock'n'roll. But when it
becomes clear that the talents
have decayed, it's the responsi-
bility of second generation crit-
ics to come to arms. Let the
condescending begin. The king
is indeed wearing no clothes!!!
