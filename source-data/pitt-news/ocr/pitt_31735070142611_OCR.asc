Wheatley  
talks
diversity

State representative p
analyzes retention rates

Gwenn Barney
For The Pitt News

Like most Pitt students, University
alumnus and current state Rep.
Jake Wheatley occasionally skipped
a class.

But instead of sleeping through
lectures, he used the time to help
improve conditions in_ the Hill Dis-
trict.

As a student, Wheatley, who grad-
uated from the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs in
2000, served on the Hill District’s
Community Development Corpora-
tion and immediately noticed a large
difference between his native city
and Pittsburgh. A

“In Detroit,” Wheatley said,
“there is a fairly inﬂuential African-
American middle class.”

Wheatley, who spoke in Posvar
Hall Friday as part of GSPIA’s Ros-
coe Robinson Jr. Memorial Lecture
Series, said that concept is not as
prominent within Pittsburgh’s com-
munity. He partly credits this differ-
ence to the high percentage ofblack

college graduates who leave the city >

after completing their degree.
Wheatley said a recent poll
showed that 7 out of 10 ‘black col-
lege students plan to leave Pittsburgh
as soon as they graduate. He blames
this exodus of students on a lack of
available jobs for young people and
a deﬁcient atmosphere for young

G—20 arresteesface felony charges

Court dates set for six people arrested during G—20 protests

Michael Macagnone

V Senior Staﬁwriterl

Lauren Wasson, 23, of Pittsburgh,
also known as “Bike Girl,” stood
outside the Criminal Division
Chambers of the Allegheny County
Courthouse today, quietly waiting
for her attorney and the district
attorney to set her day in court.

Six people with multiple charges
relating to last September’s G-20
protests, including Wasson, re-
ceived their court dates at a series
of pretrial conferences today.

All six have felony charges, ac- *

cording to court documents. Glen
S.‘ Downey, Wasson’s attorney, said
the DA’s office is not currently hav-
ing any discussion of plea bargains

or deals.

Mike Manko, spokesman for DA .

Stephen Zappala Jr., said the six
with felony charges would likely
see trial.

“They’re all in the system,”
Manko said. “They’ll all have their
day in court.”

, The format differed drastical-
ly from the “organized chaos” of

previous hearings, as one attorney
called it. The crowd lined the hall-
way for 50 feet on either side of the
Criminal Division Chambers of the
courthouse by 9 a.m.

These conferences were not ex-

lclusive to the G—20 arrestees, as

previous hearings were. Many of
the pretrial conferences handled
by the court today went through

Friends, We Are Change support ‘Bike Girl’ incourt

Court 4 2

Judge David Cashman, including
the six G—2O defendants.

Judge Kevin Sasinoski held one
of the G—20-related pretrial con-
ferences. Cashman held the other
ﬁve.

At 9:30 a.m., the receptionist
called the ﬁrst name. Every ﬁve
minutes, about two people would
enter the ofﬁce before leaving just
a few minutes later.

The attorneys for each of the
ﬁve G—2o defendants who dealt
with Cashman entered the judge’s
chambers for a few minutes before
emerging with a court date, most
of which were injune. They spoke
brieﬂy with their clients before
leaving.

Wasson said her nickname
“Bike Girl” came from the media

after WTAE—4TV caught Wasson’s
arrest on video, which has since
been posted on YouTube. On tele-
vision, Wasson said that report-
ers referred to her as “Bike Girl”
whenever they showed the clip. As
of Friday, the video had more than
17,000 views on YouTube.

Police arrested Wasson Thurs-
day, Sept. 24, and charged her with
aggravated assault and obstruction
of highways, according to court
documents. Those documents list
aggravated assault as a class—two
felony and obstruction of highways
as a summary offense.

The video shows Wasson rid-
ing her bike down the sidewalk as
part of a crowd moving away from
advancing police. A police officer
behind Wasson shoves her, and

she gets off the bike before being
shoved again by a second oﬂicer.
Wasson then turns around and

supporters arrived with Wasson,
including members of the group
We Are Change. '

of Washingtonand a member of
We Are Change, said she became
interested in “Bike Girl” after see-
ing the YouTube video.

“I didn’t have to re—watch it.

It really pissed me off,” Trovich
said. V

Trovich wasn’t in Pittsburgh for
the Summit, but has since become
involved by providing “moral sup-
port” for Wasson through We Are
Change.

information about people’s rights
and organizes to protect them,
Trovich said.

Representative: Bias toward seniors takes from education

people to relax after work.

“We claim to have a 24-hour
Downtown,” Wheatley said, “but how
can a Downtown be a24-hour Down-
town if stores close at 6 p.m.?”

Wheatley, who represents Allegh-
eny County, contends that a lack of
diversity extends beyond the city of
Pittsburgh to the State Assembly, not
only in terms of race, but also in re-
gard to gender and socio—economic
diversity.

In a series of statistics he present- <

ed to the audience, Wheatley stated
that of the 253 members of the state’s
political body 37 are women, 21 are
black, one is Asian, and one is an
American Indian.

“Up until 2006, we hadn’t had
a woman elected to the House,”
Wheatley said. He also directed
attention to the fact that while the
national government stands at 3
percent minority membership, the
state government is somewhat lag-
ging behind with 1 percent minority
membership. _

Wheatley said if people want to
solve this problem, state represen-
tatives and Pennsylvania citizens
should be open and honest with one
another about their strengths and
their challenges.

He highlighted one example of an
attempt at openness in his own life.
Though he served in the Marines,
Wheatley has never been hunting
and is a staunch guncontrol advo-
cate. However, he often encourages

members of the Senate who oppose
gun control to invite him on hunt-
ing trips in an attempt to bridge the
divide between those senators and
himself.

Wheatley contended that similar
tactics of openness and honesty can
be used by Pennsylvania citizens and
law makers to achieve unity, despite
possible differences.

“We have a lot to do,” Wheatley
said of Pittsburghers’ role in cham-
pioning diversity, “but we have a lot
of opportunity to do it.”

In addition to his comments on

diversity, Wheatley also took time to

note a signiﬁcant digression taking
place against college students in the

_ funds appropriations process. As a

member of the Appropriations Sub-
committee on Education, Wheatley
said he has seen legislators exhibit a
bias toward senior citizens.

He said legislators often choose
to devote money towards seniors’
causes, such as property taxes and
senior rent rebate, over educational
institutions such as Pitt, because se-

niors make up the majority of Voters. i

For this reason, legislators put very
little consideration into putting the
city’s new gaming revenue toward
education, Wheatley said. ,

“It’s a challenge of mentality,”
Wheatley said. “Everybody cowers
to the senior voting bloc .” He said
he hopes that this bias within the
state legislature will change in the
ﬁiture.

Pitt office assists students in move off campus

Website guides students through renting process

Carla Trinca- Conley
For The Pitt News

For Pitt seniors and students who
lost the housing lottery, the Ofﬁce
of Off—Campus Living can make
the move off campus easier.

“We’ve tried to go out and
gather the information for the
students so they don’t have to
themselves,” said Kevin Stiles,
manager of leasing and support
services in the Office of Off—Cam—
pusLiving.

Stiles, along with others in the

Office of Off—Campus Living, has
worked hard to bring all useful '

information into one location,
saving students from spending
time searching at other sites.
The office, filled with bro-
chures and pamphlets, has a
room where students can ac-
cess computers and phones to
contact real estate agents. There
are three large maps on the wall

    

 

showing streets in relation to
campus. -

The department has been
around since the early 1990s.
The building is located on North
Bellefield Avenue just behind
Ruskin Hall, but students can
also visit its website, www.ocl.
pitt.edu. .

The web page is focused on
guiding students through the
renting process more than on
what apartments are available,
Stiles said.

Stiles said the Web site offers
ﬁrst—time renters some ideas,
including what precautions to
take, checklists to help find
apartments and average rents
in the area.

“Go to the Web site first,
before the process of actually
meeting with landlords, if for no
other reason to get a checklist
that shows some general ques-
tions that you can ask a landlord,
and that way you can stay consis-

tant vice chancellor, said anyone
answering the survey questions
remains anonymous.

Wilds said generally the same

‘ Wilds said the feedback is use-

want to deal with or not.

According to Stiles, “Main—

Students up their saving sawy in winter

To save money on utilities, some students resort to creative measures

Simone Cheatham
Staﬁ’ Writer

If you’re renting an apartment or a house
as a student, you understand how hard it
can be to save money and live comfortably
throughout the year. Between tuition, books
and other living expenses, money can dis-
appear quickly. Some students constantly

ﬁnd quirky ways to save money, especially.

on utilities in off—campus apartments.
Electricity accounts for a big chunk
of monthly utilities for the average renting

1 student. For some people, the electric bill is

incorporated into their rent. But for most,
electricity comes as a separate cost.

Demsas Gebrehiwot, a Pitt senior rent- -

ing a house with six roommates, said the
electric bill always causes strife, especially
in the warmer months when they use air
conditioning. Their electric bill usually runs
around $120 per month.

“One of our roommates tries to be
conscious about the electricity, always
turning off lights, sometimes sitting in
the dark for no reason,” Gebrehiwot said.

“Sometimes it’s ridiculous, but I’m glad
we try to save money when that bill comes
every month.” ,

His roommate, Robel Terzera, sees
the logic in taking extra measures to save
money. “It might seem a little crazy to
turn off the lights as much as possible, but
it saves us all money,” he said. “And if it’s
saving us money, it'can’t be that ridiculous.
Sometimes you just have to do what you
have to.”

You don’t have to sit in the dark to save
electricity, though. Using compact ﬂuores-
cent light bulbs can reduce your monthly
electric bill by a considerable amount. Ac-
cording to the United States Department
of Energy’s Web site, lighting in houses
and apartments constitutes 20 percent of
electric bills, and by using ﬂuorescent light
bulbs, people can reduce their energy usage
by up to 75 Percent. V

And the best part‘? They usually cost
about $3.99 each.

“We’ll deﬁnitely have to start trying
those,” Gebrehiwot said. “It’s got to beat
sweating to death and turning everything
off all of the time.” '

Pets prove a problem inrented apartments

Students endure extra costs to live with pets

Tonyjovenitti
Staﬁ'Wri ter

Helicopters, ambulances, drunken partiers
and the occasional rioters make for a never-
silent neighborhood. But there is one sound
you’ll rarely hear in Oakland — barking.

Many landlords, worried about dam-
age to either their apartments or to their
tenants’ eardrums, make it hard for Pitt
students to own dogs. They charge extra
fees for the animals or prohibit them al-
together. ,

But some students, determined to have
furry friends, have either given in to the

system, or found ways around it.

Why Fluffy can’t always come home

Landlords cite a variety of reasons for
prohibiting pets, most commonly dogs.

Michael Mcsorley, vice president of
Sterling Land Company, which owns nu-
merous propertiesthroughout Oakland,
said his company prohibits dogs because,
“They bark, and that’s a problem.”

But since cats don’t make much noise,

he said, they are welcome.

Several realtors allow cats in apart-
ments, but usually at a cost. ,

Sterling Land Company charges a $275
one-time, non—refundable fee for one cat,
and $425 for two. Part of that money goes
into extra cleaning of the apartment when
the tenant moves out.

Many property owners do not allow pets

at all because of the prevalence of dog and
cat allergies.

McSorley said Sterling Land Company
also bans dogs because some students are
irresponsible pet owners.

“Irresponsible owners allow dogs to go
the bathroom in the apartment,” he said. “If
it stinks because of a cat, it will come out
of their security deposit,” he said.

Walnut Capital, which also owns apart-
ments in Oakland, allows both dogs and
cats — for a non—refundable fee amounting
to half of one,month’s rent.

“We have no problems with pets,” said
Kellie Frazier, Walnut Capital’s assistant
leasing manager. And they aren’t too wor-
ried about allergies.

A lawyer’s lesson in leases  

THIS MOCK LEASE SHOWS WHAT TO AVOID IN A LEASE

 

'5' ., . ...4"

_ Sne erk S 5

Apartments

"Taming 2 square feet into 2 grand since 1987.”

. 1. TERMS: A) The owner may enter his property at anytime without giving prior notice to the tenant.

Lawyer’s response: Don’t sign the lease. This is common in commercial leases but not residential leases. Tenants
have a right to quiet enjoyment, and if they see this in a lease, Friedson said there are probably bigger problems.

5 . B) The tenant may not turn the heat below 62 degrees. If the water pipes burst because of the low temperature and the
tenant did not abidegby this rule, then the tenant is responsiblerfor the damages.

Tenants may not ﬂush any items that are not septic safe.

‘ Lawyer’s response: There’s nothing wrong with a lawyer being speciﬁc on a lease agreement. Friedson saidlthat
while this might sound suspicious, it’s just making the terms clear.

. 2 ' PAY: A) The tenant agrees to pay six months of rent up front for a total of $3,600, with each month's rent after be
ing $600 for the one-year lease.

Lawyer’s response: This is sometimes a problem for international students studying in the United States because
owners could potentially have problems retrieving unpaid rent, but this violates the Fair Housing _Agreement.

5 B) Tenants must pay rent before the ﬁrst of the month which the rent covers. If he fails to make this payment, the owner I
willpenalize the tenant with a $100 late fee.

Lawyer’s response: Extraordinary late fees are a common problem in leases. Anything $10 or more is
“ridiculous” for students, he says.

CI) Tenants will pay the owner $600 as a security deposit in addition to the ﬁrst six ‘month's rent. Pets must be approved
by the owner, and tenants will be charged $600 for the pet security deposit. ’

Lawyer’s response: Pet deposits usually nm between $50 to $200.‘
The terms of this lease terminate upon sale of the property.

Lawyer’s response: This can be problematic because if the owner sells the property, the tenant will be forced out
of the property early. ‘

Students can turn up the temperatures
in their refrigerators to 40 degrees and
freezers to zero degrees to ensure maxi-
mum efﬁciency. Turning off and unplug-
ging certain appliances lil_<e TVs, computers
and cell phone chargers when they’re not
in use always helps decrease the electric
bill, too. ,

Heating costs can also hurt students
ﬁnancially. Tiffany Strong, a Pitt senior
renting a three-bedroom apartment in
Shadyside, said she’s taken some unusual

measures to cut her gas bill down over S S

the past few months. Her and her room-
mates’ gas bill regularly costs $55 to $70
each month. A
“When it was really cold here in Octo-
ber, my heat wasn’t turned on yet, so I did
the only thing that made sense. I opened
my oven and turned it up to about 325
degrees,” Strong said. “Honestly, I think
that provided better heat then the regular
radiators.”
Gebrehiwot said that because his

oven has its ups and downs, he and his’

housemates have other techniques that
help provide heat without ‘turning up the

thermometer.

“We just recently turned on the heat, n

so before that, we basically lived in layers
of clothing and sweatshirts,” Gebrehiwot
said. “We eventually turned it on though.
It was just too cold.” '

Students can also do other small
tasks to help save a few dollars on heat.
According to msnbc.com, ceiling fans can
reduce heating costs if residents set them
on their lowest setting during the winter.

Since heat rises, the heated air will circu- ,

late downwards and throughout the rooms

. where fans are located. People should also

vacuum their vents and radiators regularly
and arrange furniture in a way that won’t
hinder heat circulation.

Space heaters can be used to heat

certain rooms, too. But space heaters can
end up costingjust as much or more if used
too much and can be dangerous if left unat-
tended. The U.S. Department of Energy’s
website says that portable heaters start
more than 25,000 residential ﬁres annually,
resulting in over 300 deaths per year.
“I’ve always heard that space heaters
are dangerous, and that’s why we don’t
use them in our apartment,” Strong said.

Lease < 11

Tenants have a right to a safe, habitable
home and should request for lock and appli-
ance replacement where necessary. Owners
are responsible for maintaining community
space, including shoveling snow off walkways,
unless said otherwise in the lease.

Friedson said that owners aren’t usually

interested in negotiating terms with student
tenants, but tenants should still try. When the
lease is over, the owner should present an item-
ized list of problems he had to repair. Tenants
should be prepared toﬁght these claims, some-
times in court, with pictures they took when
they moved into the apartment.

Editorial

Students steal
out of necessity

th the development of
the Internet came a new
relationship between

companies and the public. The norm
changed from the simple purchase
model — paying directly for goods
—- to the new technology model
— getting goods with the click of a
mouse. ’

Of course, the latter is illegal and
has prompted publishing companies
to pursue download regulations, spe-
ciﬁcally on ﬁle—sharing sites. Music
and videos have long been stolen
cybergoods, but it seems a new type
of ﬁle is becomingpopular: the docu-
ment.

According to The Chronicle of
Higher Education, agroup of publish-
ingcompanies have askedﬁle-sharing
sites to help stop book piracy. Some
key sites include Rapidshare and
4shared. Rapidshare has previously
complied by helping to stop music
and video piracy.

There are so many sites that host
these documents that a phalanx
would be nearly impossible. Also,
the ﬁle—sharing sites in question rely
on advertising fortheir revenue, and
so depend on traffic, which could be
dampened by stricter regulation.

But it’s more important to try to
understand why this speciﬁc piracy
occurs.

Most people do not like spend-
ing money or cannot afford to buy
digital items. They resort to down-
loading what they could otherwise
have purchased. However, music and
videos are generally leisure items. Go-
ing with or without a certain piece of
music does not change oneis quality of
life. Books and articles, on the other
hand,’are at the core of education.
The lack of such materials directly af-

fects life, especially a student’s life.
Textbooks are sometimes expen-
sive. Because publishing companies
have a monopoly on certain books,
they can in their own right demand
what they wish, includingaprice out

of some students’ budgets. Even if the

campus lends out the book, there are
only so many copies available, and
only so many hours a library can be
open. ’

And keep inmind that itis irnpor—
tant to have that book to prepare for
class the next day.

Expectably, a student would turn
to the Internet in desperate hope,
looking for that shiny blue “down-
load” button, and he might very well
succeed.

Maybe publishing companies
need to address this issue differently.

’ If companies universally provided a

digital copy of abook at alower price,
students wouldn’t need to scavenge
the web. Although it might seem
like an unnecessary loss of money,
it could end up balancing out. Those
students that would have otherwise
downloaded the book bought the
digital copy. The company would
also eliminate printing, shipping and
stocking expenses.

Retroﬁtting current textbooks to
digital format is costly, so such a plan
would be an investment, most effec-
tive for future editions.

No one need condone breaking
the law, but it is important to look at
motives behind actions. If compa-
nies could provide a cheaper solu-
tion, there would be less of a motive
to partake in illegal activity.

The law will always struggle to
keep up with technology. A collab-
orative effort would slow down the
race.

 

Its pronounced ‘Lee’

Solutions in stimulus

Stimulus can break cycle of US economy’s shaky conﬁdence

 
 
  

Lewis Lehe
Columnist

Right now,thereisaweird asymmetry
between the economics of politicians
and the economics of economists. In
the world of politicians, supporting
economic stimulus is synonymous

with stupidity, greed and shortsightedi ‘

ness. It’s as if the idea is so shockingly
wrong that only moral or intellectual
» failure can explain someone’s support

~ forthe American Recovery and Rein-

vestment Act (ARRA).

Among economists, however,
the case for stimulus enjoys support
across the political spectrum, although
the details of how best to execute a
stimulus vary; In Tuesday’s Wall
Streetjournal, for example, Martin
Feldstein, a Nobel Laureate economist
who designed many of Reagan’s poli-
cies, advocated the need for stimulus,
even as he distanced hirnselffrom the
ARRA. _ I‘ as

Youmight not agree withthe case
for stimulus. But I hope that hearing
the case will calm some people down.
Today, I endorse economic stimulus.

What is the theory of economic
stimulus? It’s the idea that a govem—
ment can pull the economy out of a
recessionbyborrowingmoney andus—
ing it for tax cuts or deﬁcit spending.
Why would that work?

It turns out that many parts of
the economy are conﬁdence games.
Businesses hire workers and buy
equipmentbased ontoday’s earnings.
Consumers make purchases based on
today’s household income. But the
businesses’ hiring is the consumers’
income, and the consumers’ purchases
arethe businesses’ income. It’s acircle
that depends on conﬁdence. .

If somethinghappensthatshakes
our conﬁdence, then consumers and
businesses stop spending money
in ways that depend on conﬁdence
-— like buying new dishwashers or
retroﬁtting old plants to make new
chemicals. People save money instead.
Up to a point, more savings will lower
interest rates and increase business
investment, but when the interestrate
hits zero, then business investment
maxes out. Highersavings lower busi-

‘’ ness income, so businesses cut invest-

ment and employment, which lowers
income for consumers and other busi-
nesses. It’s avicious_ cycle.

One goal of a stimulus is to stop
the self—ﬁ1lﬁlling prophecy caused by
aloss of conﬁdence. Basically, the gov-
ernment says to the American people,

.3 “I will give you some government

bondsifyou give me some ofyoursav—
ings.” Then, the government just gives
the money rightbackto the peoplevia

tax cuts and deﬁcit spending. So the.

people’s total wealth — their money

‘A plusthestockandbondstheyown—

66  

is unchanged, but the people’s present
income is greater. A higher present

recession. -
Third, stimulus spending makes
the U.S. wealthier. The nation’s wealth
depends on its technology, workforce
and capital. Period. Ifthe stimulus re-
stores conﬁdence, and thereby causes
businesses to build more factories, of-
ﬁces, houses and machinery, thenthe
nationwillbe wealthier. Ifthe stimulus

-keeps people healthy and educated,

then the nation will be wealthier.
It’s important to see through the

illusion that debt can create in times A
‘ like ours. The true cost of something

is what must be given up to obtain
it. And in normal times, when the

One goal of ‘a stimulus is to stop the _
self—fulﬁlling prophecy caused by a loss

of conﬁdence.

income restores conﬁdence.
Fine, but isn’t the stimulus ex-
pensive?

The Tea Party movement com— '

plains that stimulus spendingburdens
the U.S. with debt and will make the
country poorerinthe ﬁrture. They are
right to worry about the long—terrn
budget outlook, since Medicare and
Medicaid are insanely not sustainable,
but wrong to worry that the stimulus
has anything to do with it. Why not?

‘ First, investors have been scared
to lendto consumers or corporations,
so the government can borrow at ri-
diculously low interest rates — about
3.3 percent. Therefore, interest on the
stimulus debt won’t impose notice-
ably’ higher taxes down the road. The
Congressional Budget Office estimate
fromjan. 2009 predicted about $347

‘billion in interest over 10 years. This

is about $35 billion per year. Today’s
GDP is $14.2 trillion. *

Second, deﬁcit spending is the‘
cheapest way for the government to
buy things it needs to buy anyway.
Prices and wages fall during a reces-
sion. So, if the governmentis going
to repave a road, it’s cheapest to buy

the materials and workers during the W I

Eng?

government buys things, the cost is

tangible. That is, the labor andfactory —

capacity required go to government
production, so they can’t go to private
production.

But in a bad recession, workers
are unerr1ployed,and factories runfar
below capacity. Putting workers and
factories to work doesn’t impose much
of a real cost on society, because soci-
ety wasn’t using them anyway.’

The fact that the governmentwill
have to have to collect money from
some Americans and then give it to
others (the debt holders) is an account-

ing trick. The only effect bywhich the

debt payments makeAmerica poorer
is that the taxesrequired to raise $35

_ billion per year will reduce citizens’

work effort ever so slightly.

. Ihavebeentalkingaboutstimulus
spending as a concept. The Ameri-
can Recovery and Reinvestment Act
is areal bill, made by politicians inthe
messy real world. It has a lot of ﬂaws.
In my next column, I’ll talk about the
speciﬁcs oftheARRA. I hope, though,
that I’ve made the case that there is a

case to be made for stimulus.

Perhaps the most chronically heart-
breaking assumption is the assump-
tion that devices in your life will ac-
tually work. or *
We expect a lot out of our
technology — both simple and
complex. We expect our computers
to be fast and not crash, we expect
our dryers to work, and we even get
annoyed when the most important,
yet simplest tool — the No. 2'pen-
cil — breaks. This expectation is
so ingrained that instead of doing
a little dance of victory in praise of
the marvels of technology every time
our computer works, we do noth-
ing. Instead of reﬂecting upon the
folly of mankind, or the imperfec-

tion of nature every time Windows

crashes, we wail, gnash our teeth,

_ .and secretly wish we could give our
computer aVil<ing funeral right then ‘

and there. . -
Speaking ofbillowing ﬂames, my

latest experience with non-working

technology occurred at a very spe-

cial someone’s apartment just over a
week ago. The pilot light in her oven
had gone out, and I, in full prince-
charming mode, was going to try
to ﬁx it.

Now, even in our post-macho
era, men are expected to know how
to do these kinds of things. Even if
we haven’t seen this particular piece
of equipment before, even if all the
gas appliances we’ve looked at were
piezoelectric, even if we haven’t
looked very closely at a piezoelec-

tric appliance, even if we can’t build’

acardboard box—— never mind build
our way out of one — we men are
expected to have some kind of amaz-
ing mechanical aptitude. Or at least
that’s what we think people expect,
and what we secretly expect of our-
selves. This is why some men don’t
read directions. It isn’t stupid. It’s a
point of pride.

Well, _I had already racked up
strike one by looking at the direc-
tions. Ithen proceeded to trytolight
the oven, which was really difficult
consideringthatl presumed the pilot
light was in the oven’s back-left cor-

ner, next to a “thingy” painted red. '

The matches also had an unfortunate

tendency to burn a bit quickly. I had

to be nimble and quick, never mind ‘

the limbo stick.
About 15 matches later, we still
had no luck. It wasn’t clear as to

tions on the oven. I called my dad.
Now, it isn’t that dear old dad was
going to chortle at me for having to
offer some advice. He offers advice
all the time. Everyone needs a hobby.

Now, even in our post-macho era, men
are expected toknow how to do these

kinds of things.

whether gas was entering the oven,

. and any smell of gas was more than

masked by the sulfurous smell of

matches. We tried again, but by _

this time, it was a little unnerving
to be working around natural gas.
As much as I’d love to be an astro-

. naut, lighting an oven improperly

is considered perhaps the worst way
of reaching near-earth orbit. It also
raises eyebrows around campus if
yours have been singed off.

So, I did something even more
embarrassing than look at the direc-

And yet, it’s always a little embar-
rassing to tell your old man that you
don’t know what you’re ‘doing.

Well, guess what? 30 minutes on
the phone, and another 15 matches
later, we were still stuck with the
same problem.

So, a few days later, with the as-
sistance of the landlord, the pilot
light is relit. I am not on hand for
the occasion, butI hear even the me-
chanic had trouble lighting it. That
was the good news. The bad news
was when I looked at the relit light

it beeame clear that it was nowheie
near where I thought it was. The di-
rections had lied! I knewl shouldn’t
have read them.

So, what have we learned from
all this? First and foremost, when
you get an apartment, familiarize
yourselfwith your appliances when
they are in working order. Not all of
them might be reparable, and you
don’t necessarily want to, say, take

apart your fridge only to ﬁnd you I

can’t put it back together. However,
some things to know would be where
the stove pilot lights are located,
how to shut off water to your sinks,
what your refrigerator compressor
sounds like, which light bulbs are
used in the house and where, and
how your doors and windows lock.
Not only does this enable you to
ﬁx something simple when it goes
wrong, it enables you to recognize
when something has gone wrong.
It might also save you a lot of self-
kicking in good time. You have a per-
fect right to expect that the major
things in your apartment will work,
but know what you are expecting.

College should offer cooking course for those unprepared

Caitlyn Christensen
Columnist

' Living on my own for the ﬁrst time
this year, I quickly realized my inepti-

tude with basic life skills.

Ipaid mybills ontime and did my
laundry. Most days I even made my
bed. The real issue came at dinner
time, when barren shelves offered
little comfort for my empty stomach.

‘ Life after a meal plan is difﬁcult.

’ Iknewlbroughtmyhungerupon

myself. My mother always tried to
encourage me to cook. Before I moved
into my apartment this summer she

attempted to teach me a few simple .

recipes, but I was more interested in
watching “Entourage” re-runs.

I immediately regretted my apa-
thy once I arrived to school. In class I
would day-dream about ﬁlet mignon
and a tray of chocolate chip cookies.

Pitt guarantees housing for the -
ﬁrst three years of school, but by ju- .

nior; senior, or even sophomore year,
many students are ready to move on.

We are paying an institution to pre-
pare us for the real world, and taking
care of oneselfis part of a comfortable,
well-rounded lifestyle. Pitt already of-
fers one—credit dance, exercise and
swimming classes. So why not offer
some domestic skills classes, too? A
home economics course would be the
perfect way to prepare for the harsh
realities of life after Market Central.
Pitt spokesman john Fedele said
that he had never heard of a col-
lege home economics program and
didn’t know if it would be considered

at.Pitt.

I’m not suggesting such a course
should be mandatory. Still, imagine
a class where your midterm exam
involves baking a sheet of chocolate
chip cookies or blending the perfect
smoothie. Picture the glory of bast-
ing a turkey and arranging a rack of
lamb foryourﬁnal grade. The reward

for rolling out of bed and going to a I

morning class would be a glorious
well-rounded meal, complete with
side dishes. College studentswould
both never go hungry and not have

to settle for the drab diets of canned
soup and frozen pizzas.

I know I’m not the only one with
domestiotroubles. The ﬁrst time I did
laundry last year, a group of freshman
living in Towers asked for my help.
They couldn’t crack the detergent
code: Does it go inbefore or after you
put in the clothes? Before or after you
started the machine? And softener?
Their lights and darks were jumbled
together in a hopeless mess.

_ would lead me to limitless swipes into Mar-

ket Central. Yet they weren’t very interested
in feeding a creepy upperclassman for long. I
stood outside of Market Central’s gates like Eve

wonders 

With time I’ve learned how to cope without
a meal plan, but it’s been apainful process, and
a class on this topic could have/been helpful.
At the beginning of the year my roommates
and I got by on Krispy Kreme donuts. Once my
arteries started moaningl switchedto ‘.‘healthy”
options like pasta, peanutbutter sandwiches and
vegetables. Nothing made for ﬁilﬁlling meals.

‘ Standing in the kitchen, locking eyes with my

oven, I decided to suppress my gag reﬂex and
cook meat. ' - _
I had difficulty bringing myself to dissect

quivering chicken from its Styrofoam tray was

evenworse. I gritted my teeth and threwthe ani— 4

I added French Onion soup mix, the crumbly i

kind that comes inapackage. \

I watched it cook and ate it tentatively. And
you know what? It wasn’t so bad. Not like my
mom’s, but edible. Ibroke up some lettuce and

made a small side salad. My stomach raised its
hands in triumph: Finally, a balanced meal.

I learned what I could and could not bear to

In the meantime, to prevent scurvy, I try to
buy fresh produce at IGA weekly. Apples last
seemingly forever. Black beans are goodfor pro-

American organ donorsin

Every single person onthis campushasthe means
to impact countless lives. There are currently
more than 96,000 people waiting for an organ
transplant in the US, "according to The Interna-
tionalAssociation for Organ Donation. Each day

an average of 17 people die while waiting for an -

organ donation, andinthe past15years the num-
ber of people onthe listhas grownby morethan

 hangs solely on the generosity of organ

Organ donation 1 18

Whenlﬁrstlearnedthat organs could be given
and taken, I was very young. Our housekeeper’s
husband needed a kidney. My mom would ask
her everyweek, “Did you ﬁnd adonor?” and her
replywas always, “Still waiting.” A

The thoughtwas scary—_ I doubtl even knew
whatakidneywas orwhat it did. Sometimes, the
lack ofknowledge hinders any chance offorming‘
a connection with something. However, even
though we might not be aware of something, it
doesn’t mean it has no effect on us. *

Originally, organ donation was something I
always cringed at because, through my naivety,
all I knew was that Iwas made of “guts.” In high

school, Iwas reacquainted with organ donation
at Girls State (an American Legion Auxiliary pro-
gramfor high schooljuniors inwhichparticipants
simulate political contests), whenadelegate pre-
sented a bill on organ donaﬁon awareness. The
counselors loved the idea so much they gave each
girl a handout on becoming an organ donor. At
16 I still thought the idea of organ donation was
frightening. The thought of dying and having my

people don’t think about mortality because, as
we would like to believe, we “have our whole
lives ahead of us.”

But death is something that we should not
think of as so foreign. Everybody has been ex-
posed to death directly or indirectly. Most of

deaths and seen tragic stories about accidents
and homicides. -

While itis certainly not my intent:iontopreoc—
cupyyou with the inevitability of death, I do want
you to think about life. How can a person’s life
change by rec'eivinganorgan?Atﬁrst, Ididn’t like
the idea of organ donation because it reminded
me ofpain, illness andbeingno more. Thenl saw
the other side of it — a close family friendwas in
desperate need of a kidney and he received one
from a total stranger. There are many people
 on the organttansplantlistand it is quite
possiblethatyou knew, know orwill know some-
body on that list. The people who sufferbecause
they need healthy organs or tissues are siblings,
parents or friends. Thinking about organ dona-
tioninamore personalway made itless scary and
allowed me to open up_ more to the idea.

What’stherushtobecomeanorgandonor?I’ '

don’t plan on dying any time soon. After coming
to college and living by myself, however, I am

' more aware of all the ways apersoncould die just
. doingeveryday things. Deaths caused by common

things like being in an automobile, getting the ﬂu
or an infection are  the top.15 causes of death
inthe United Sta . ~

Inthe subset of accidents, the most common A

way to die is as a pedestrian. As students, we
spend a lot of time walking on roads and being

‘ near cars. Slipping and hittingyour head, alcohol

poisoning, accidentaldrugoverdose——there are
plenty ofways that normal people. doing normal
things ‘can die. Life is unpredictable —— no one
knows how long she will live, so we should not
waittobecomeanorgan donor, orto do anything
forthat matter. We may not have our whole lives
to do it.  . I

With this perspective, organ donation was
no longer a subject toicringe about, but rather it
is a reminder to take responsibility for a social
issue. p '

You can become an organ donor by going to
organdonongov and ﬁlling out an organ donor
card and keeping it in your wallet. It is also very

sion, because you are their responsibility after
your death. ‘

If you’re a fLrst—time party-thrower, columnist Samantha Stahl offers essential tips in making the night a successful rager

Samantha Stahl
Columnist

So you’ve decided to welcome
your fellow peers into your home
for a little soiree. Whether you’re
shooting for a tame evening of
wine and board games or an all-
out night of mayhem, there are
a few things you should know.
iffhere are four main components
to throwing a good party: people,
ambience, music and alcohol.
Most of these rules are not
applicable to fraternity parties,
which are in an entirely different
league. So, sorry I don’t have any
tips for you, brothers. Besides,
from what I experienced in my
underclassman days, it seems

like you already have the party-

throwing thing under control.
(Actually more like, not under
"Control at all  in a good way.) —

Let’s start with the pre-event
planning. When making that cru-
cial Facebook event, here are
some things to keep in mind: Be
funny in your description. Say-
ing, “We’re celebrating Sara’s get-

ting old! She’s ﬁnally 19!!!!1!!1!!!”

is not going to impress anyone.
Themes are great in theory,

butrpeople are usually hesitant

to dress up so they don’t look.

freakishly out of place if they go
to another party or bar later in
the night. If you don’t mind low
levels of enthusiasm, then theme
away. “Jersey Shore” parties are

I all the rage lately, but feel free to -

be creative.

Invite more people than you
want to come. Most aren’t going
to show up. We live in Oakland,
after all. It’s easy to get distract-
ed and no one likes walking more
than two blocks so there’s a good
chance they won’t make it. But
people will feel good about being

invited. So just do it. If some-

one you don’t like shows up, in.-
troduce them to someone else

you don’t like very much. Maybe .

they’ll hit it off and credit you
with matchmaking prowess.

On the day of your party, try
to straighten up your house a
little bit. I’m not saying go out
and buy freshly cut ﬂowers, but
make your place seem clean and

Decorating on a dime: it can be done

Six easy alternatives to standard IKEA-decked college apartments

Merritt Wuchina
1. Stajf Writer

What do you think of when you hear
the phrase “college apartment”?

, Band posters lining the walls and

empty liqueur bottles stacked on
Kghelves? Generic paintings and fur-
niture from IKEA or Target?
Unfortunately, this decor is the
norm, but instead of being tacky or
boring next year, move into a room
or apartment with which you can
be creative.
 You don’t have to spend a lot of
money on decorating your room
or be a design diva to make it look

good. Nor do you have to be cheap
and sleazy by using empty boxes of
Antoon’s pizza as a center piece on
the dining room table.

Here are six easy ways I have
decorated and furnished my apart-
ment without spending excessive
amounts of money. OK, maybe I
spent a little money on unnecessary
stuff, but trust me, no one wants to
come home to white walls. Without
decoration you’ll start feeling like
you’re in prison — which for Towers
residents, might be all too true.

1) Tapestries: Ah yes, the essen-
tial college tapestry. Cover your win-
dow with a sheet of trippy, hippie,

Indian artwork or use it to jazz up
any blank wall in your room. Luckily,
I inherited a handful from my mom

 trust me, no one
wants to come home
to white walls.

from her college days, but you can
also purchase them at the Culture
Shop or Urban Outﬁtters in South
Side. They can be a little expensive
—~ around $35 ~ but they last for-
ever.. . '

2) Plants: Add a little life to your
place in the gloomy months of No-

vember through April (yeah, that’s’

Pittsburgh for you). According to
the Chinese system of aesthetics,
Feng Shui, plants can bring ener-
gy, wealth and good luck into the
home. Even if you think Feng Shui
is bogus, many plants are proven to
reduce pollutants in the air, which
research shows can sometimes be

_ I

worse indoors than outside. Some
great plants that don’t require much
water or sunlight are bamboo, cac-
tus, or jade plants. You can usually

pick these up in a small pot at the a

gift shop in Phipps Conservatory
for around $5 to $10. .
3) Light ﬁxtures: Most lighting in
dorms and apartments is dim and
inadequate, so look around for a
unique and colorful light ﬁxture.
If you ever want anyone, includ-
ing yourself, to hang out in your

L room, some extra lighting is worth

a small investment. My favorites are

Dorm posters can make

» Andy Tybout
Columnist

If you feel an urge to express yourself but
don’t want to spend a whole hour writing
an essay or painting, fear not: there’s still
the dorm room.

Even in dorm rooms that are barely larg-
er (and less smelly) than a prison cell, a stu-
dent’s decorations — particularly his post-
ers —< say a lot about him. Rage Against the
Machine and Noam Chomsky? The kid’s a
rebel. Bob Marley and The Notorious B.I.G'.?
Make sure to disable the smoke detectors.

I’m here to ensure your personality doesn’t 1

get lost intranslation.

We’ll' startwithi music. As a college stu-

dent, you want your music posters to say: I’m
cultured, but down-to-earth. The “cultured”
part means striking a balance between qual-

ity and obscurity — achieving a harmony -

between well-known, well-respected artists
and artists so obscure even their own moth-
ers haven’t heard of them. For example, the
cultured college student may hang a poster
of some unknown indie band (if they make
posters) alongside a poster of Radiohead.
Conversely, the down-to—earth part means

assuaging people’s snob radar with some— ‘V

thing everyone loves — Bruce Springsteen,
say, or The. Lpnely Island.

_Free things are also a plus. Whenever
someone gives you a poster without de-

mandingsome sort of currency, take it and -

hang it up — miracles like this are few and
far between. For freshman year, I had three
posters on my wall: two “Observe and Re-
port” posters and a Flyers poster. I don’t
particularly love either of those things -
the movie was sporadically humorous, and
I’ve never been a fan of Philadelphia sports.
But they were giving out free “Observe and
Report” posters at the screening last year,
and one of my roommates had found the
Flyers poster lying on the street, just waiting

p to be picked up. How could I say no‘?

There’s also an online outlet for frugal

   

or break ambience

poster—lover_s. It’s called The Rasterbator. At
the time this column was written, the online
version was down, but the downloadable
version of the program was still working.
All you have to do is upload an image, select '
how many sheets of paper you want the im-
age expanded to, and then hit print. Your

picture will now be spread across multiple A

pages, ready to be taped together and hung.
just don’t back up the computer labs with

Posters are all well and good, but some-
times students want to go the extra mile
and turn their dorm room into a Big Lots.
This often involves ﬂags, stolen traffic cones
and life-size cardboard cutouts. Trust me,
this is not wise‘.

Cardboard cutoutsmay hold a certain
novelty —— especially if they’re of vintage
action heroes like Bruce Lee or Chuck Norris
— but "nobody wants to wake up at three in
the morning to ﬁnd Bruce Lee’s ﬁerce eyes
boring into their soul. And it’s only a matter
of time before an officer of the law wanders
through your hallway to discover the miss-
ing trafﬁc cone whose absence caused a
pileup on Forbes. Plus, all that random crap
just makes your room look like the interior
of a Red Robin restaurant. a ‘ C

Anotherdecoration I’d steer clear of is
the “hot girls” posters. Granted, they’re
nice companions during long essay ses-
sions, but studies ‘show they’re no help in
attracting the real thing. In fact, it may be
an inverse relationship —— the more nude
women adorning your walls, the less likely
that scenario is to replicate itself in real-
ity. - .
I could give more suggestions, but if you
just followed my advice you would commit
one of the deadly sins of dorm rooms: un-
originality. So I’m going to let you go, with

- the trust that when you walk into your new

room, you’ll take your cues frombme, rather
than your grandpa. '

And for God’s sake,‘ no inspirational
posters. ‘

let you paint on‘ the walls. If they do —- awe-
some — get ready to paint! If not, paint on
something else and hang it up. All you need are

as your canvas, brushes and some watercolor

an old Lite—Brite set at a garage sale and create
a design to stick on your windowsill.

5) Record bowls: If you go to any used re- V

up some unwanted Vinyl for free. Pre—heat the
oven to about 200 degrees then place the re-
cord on top of a large bowl. Put it in the oven for
about 5 to 10 minutes and then take it out and
quickly mold it around the bowl as you wish.
Let it cool for 10 minutes and —— ta-da! —- you
have a cool bowl to hold spare change, jewelry,

— chemicals in vinyl can be toxic).

We lucked out with a kitchen table, chairs and a

A Gilbert Brown.3-pointer was almost enough to complete a Pitt

comeback.

Jay Huerbin
Sports Editor

In a game that featured a couple
hometown storylines, the Panthers
couldn’t control the ball — or the

I game — when they needed to and

fell to the Seton Hall Pirates 64-61

' yesterday.
The loss was the second in a row ’

for the No. 11 Panthers (15—4, 5-2 Big
East), who lost to Georgetown on
Wednesday night and saw the end
of their 31-game home win streak.

Sophomore guard Ashton Gibbs,
returning home after growing up
in nearby North Orange, N._]., and

‘ playing basketball at Seton Hall

Prep, scored 23' points, but was

1—of—7 from beyond the arc, in-

cluding two -missed desperation

» attempts with seconds remaining

in the game.

“I felt conﬁdent about the ﬁrst
one,” Gibbs said about his ﬁnal two
shots. “I really thought it was going
in. The second one, I didn’t have a
good look and rushed it up there.”

Gibbs, who made each of his 14
free throw attempts, scored more

“This is a stepping stone for us

stretch and at the end of the game
where it was shaky.” Pope is in his

after transferring from New Mexico
State in 2008. '
The Pirates’ victory was their
ﬁrst against a top-10 opponent
since they knocked off then—No. 8
Pitt in early March 2006. “'
But for as much personal suc-
cess that Gibbs had against the
Pirates, part of Pitt’s loss falls on
struggling to score on its 3-point

ﬁeld goals. As a team, the Panthers ~
' were 4 for 17 on long—range shots,

and no player converted more than
one attempt.

The Pirates weren’t any better,
scoring on only two of their 13 at-
tempts. But what Seton Hall failed
to do in 3-point shots, it succeeded
in points from within the arc 
something the Panthers couldn’t
do. Pitt ﬁnished the game with a
35.3 ﬁeld goal percentage.

Seton Hall entered the game giv-
ing up roughly 79 points per game
against conference opponents,
but the Panthers couldn’t ﬁnd any

Panthers’ home Win streak worth recognition

  

Greg Trietley
Columnist

After Pitt’sl7l4:-66 loss to George-
town Wednesday, a few of the fans
that stayed to the ﬁnal buzzer gave

the Panthers a lackluster round of .

applause forthe end of the team’s
31-game home win streak.

I The hesitant clapping didn’t do
the streak justice.

"Of course nobody was in the

. mood to congratulate Pitt for los-
ing, but with the Hoyas back in

Washington, I think it’s time we i

looked back at the once second-

longest home winning streak in

the nation.

Pitt kicked off the win string
against Cincinnati on Feb. 27, 2008.
The starting ﬁve: Sam Young, De-

. Juan Blair, Keith Benjamin, Levance

Fields and Ronald Ramon. Pitt beat
the Bearcats, 73-67. , I
-- The streak saw Pitt defeat 10

- different‘ Big East teams, includ-

ing Cincinnatiitw/vice and DePaul
three times. Villanova, Providence,
Seton Hall and Rutgers never vis-

ited Pittsburgh, while Georgetown _
I V-All/Ijarian Hossa. Hossa played for

killed the string. * up 9
The streak lasted 699 days. In

that span, the Detroit Lions lost at
home fourteen times.

Brett Favre retired, unretired,
was traded to the New York Jets,
retired, was released, unretired
and signed with the Minnesota Vi-
kings. Pitt’s home victories edged
out Favre’s interception total, 31-
29.

ly with the longest home winning
streak at 53 games —- had ﬁve play-
ers drafted to the NBA.

Pitt’s ﬁrst home victory coin-
cided with the Penguins acquiring

three’ teams between Pitt home

\.

Kansas — the program current— .

losses, and the Penguins won 30
playoff games.

The Wall Street Journal men-
tioned the Petersen Events Center
during the streak in its report on
the toughest places to win in col-
lege basketball, citing the Oakland
Zoo as a big reason why. The 31-
game win streak isn’t even the lon-
gest in the arena’s history + Pitt
started inside the Pete 34-0.

But as important as the home
crowd is -— 1,500 students tend
to be loud '— the road record dur-
ing the span is as impressive. The
Panthers went 23-9 away from

-home, with wins against No. 1 Con-—

'9:

necticut, No. 5 Syracuse and No. 8’
Georgetown.

Some other facts about the
streak: ’ I A

Most points scored (team): 98,
against DePaul on March 9, 2008,
the second win of the streak. Every §
Panther starter scored double dig-
its — and freshman Gilbert Brown,
too, who had 13 off the bench.

Most points scored (individu-
al): 33, Sam Young in a 74-60 win
over Belmont,‘the seventh of the
streak. Young also had the second»
highest single—game total, racking
up 31 against No. 1 Connecticut last ‘
March.

Pirates steal ball, win

Pirates 4 25
rhythm against the Pirates defense.

“We’re also a team that can win different
ways,” Seton Hall coach Bobby Gonzalez said.

“It was the 80s the other night versus Louis— ‘

ville, and today it was the 605. That’s a good
sign that you are becoming a good team.”

On offense, the Panthers couldn’t move
the ball early and turned the ball over 14 times
by halftime. They cleaned up their play in the
second half, giving it away only six times, but
those late—game turnovers came at costly
times.

With a little more than two minutes re-
maining in the game and Pitt trailing Seton
Hall 60-54, Gibbs’ pass to Gary McGhee was
intercepted by Robert Mitchell. The Pirates
didn’t score from the turnover, but Panthers
wasted time latein the game. Brad Wana-
‘_maker’s free throws withless than a minute

,_ and a half remaining cut the lead to four,

60-56. _

And after Gibbs converted two more free
throws with 37 seconds left in the game, put-
ting the Panthers within three, 61-S8, sloppy
and aggressive play gave the Panthers an op-
portunity to tie the game after a Brad Wana-
maker rebound. But seconds later, Wanamak-

er turned the ball over. The Pirates extended’

their lead back to four when Pope converted
on the back end of two free throws.
Despite a Gilbert Brown 3, which cut the

lead to one with 17 seconds to go, the Pan- -

thers couldn’t overcome their early—game
and recent turnovers. A
“We didn’t play well enough to win,” Pitt
head coachjamie Dixon said. “Our execution,
both offensively and defensively, wasn’t good
enough to win. Our turnovers were too high.
Those are things that are going to get you
beat. We made bad decisions with the ball.”
' The Panthers, who found some ‘good
news in out-rebounding the Pirates 33-23,
couldn’t overcome Seton Hall’s athleticism
and press. They trailed throughout most of
the game — by as much as 11 points in the
ﬁrst half —- and held their only lead of the
second half after ajermaine Dixon 3-point
ﬁeld goal with 18:08 to go.
The Pirates responded with a 9-0 run -
their second such run of the game — due in
part to Hope’s ﬁve pointstduring the stretch,

including a dunk after splitting two Panther

‘defenders on an inbound pass with about 15
minutes left in the game.

The Panthers will have four days to forget
about their back—to—back losses and focus on
their next game against St. John’s (12-7., 2-5).

Tip-off for the game against the Red Storm ~

is set for Thursday at 7 p.m.

Notes: The Panthers’ 20 turnovers were
the second highest of the season. They gave
the ball away 21 times against Ohio on Dec.
22  Gibbs set a career—high after convert-
ing all 14 of his free throw attempts. He set

, a school record earlier this season when he

made 46 consecutive free throws  Dixon fell '

to 32-10 all-time in games played after losing

year’s season—opening nail biter victory over
Wofford, the 22nd of the streak. The Blair
and Young-led Pitt team of 2008409 won
every game at home by at least 10 points,
but the young Panthers started off 2009-10
a bit apprehensively.

Biggest deﬁcit overcome: 10, again against
Wofford. Pitt trailed by 10 with 16:24 to go
before the Terriers defense cracked. It was
the only doubl'e—digit deﬁcit the Panthers
faced at home during the run — second place
goes to last year’s Notre Dame game, where

Remembering the great streak

Pitt trailed, 20-11, in the ﬁrst half before Blair
went off for 23 points and 22 rebounds.

Latest comeback: 1.9 seconds left and
down two against Louisville, the ﬁnal vic-
tory of the streak. Brad Wanamaker hit both
free throws to send the game to overtime, 2
the only extra session in the 31-game span.
