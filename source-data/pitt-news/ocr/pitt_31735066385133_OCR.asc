UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Staff Writer

In order to raise health cons-
ciousness, the Pitt chapter of
Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity
sponsored testing for sickle
cell anemia Friday in the Tow-
ers lobby.

Actual testing for the disease
was facilitated by Josephine
Gray and Susan Wright of the
Merray—lrvis Genetic Disease
Center.

According to Gray, sickle
cell anemia is a hereditary dis-
ease that affects one out of ev-

ery 500 Afro—Americans.

Testing for the disease is im-
portant because people can be
carriers of sickle cell anemia
and not realize it. ”This is the
reason for the rise of sickle cell
in teenage pregnancies,” ex-
plained Gray.

Due to a lack of awareness,
teenagers never inquire about
the risk of sickle Cell anemia
but are more readily con-
cerned with the risk of sexual-
ly transmitted diseases, such as
syphilis or gonorrhea.

Phi Beta Sigma also collect-
ed funds to support patients

Students tested for sickle cell

undergoing treatment at the
Merry—Irvis center because
many of their patients lack
medical coverage.

Phi Beta Sigma President
Ron, Barr stressed the fraterni-
ties’ commitment to commu-
nity service.

”Most people believe Greek
organizations focus on parties
and hanging out,” said Barr,
”but the truth is Greek organi-
zations were founded to help
others. I believe Phi Beta Sig-
ma is getting back to the origi-
nal purpose of Greek life.

Grad student group
makes a comeback

By Mark Brown

C ontriﬁuting Editor

Pitt’s Graduate and Profession-
al Student Association is making
a comeback on campus, accord-
ing to GPSA vice president for
committees Bill Mandarino.

”GI?SA died out over, the last
three years. Former President
Alice Shaeffer was the only active
officer,” Mandarino said.

“There are I5 graduate student
organizations on campus. These
elect representatives who be;
come voting members of a‘ssem—
blies,” said Mandarino.

Mandarino said that the gradu-
ate schools on campus were con-
tacted, and eight people showed
up at the first meeting in Febru-
ary. At that time, elections were
held and officers” were elected.

”Basically, we're trying to
rebuild. We've been'successful at
that since September. Our next
elections are in November. I’d
like to stay on,” said Mandarino.

According to Mandarino, the
most pressing goal of GPSA is to
achieve the creation of a more ef-
ficient framework before the
officer’s term is expired. ”We
started from scratch, and unfortu-
natly, we have no contact with
past executive members. There is

a subcommittee which formed to
‘revise our bylaws, which date
back to 1981,” said Mandarino.

._GPSA’s adviser is Dr. Terrence

Milani.

Mandarino stated that most
graduate or professional students
don't realize that they are auto-
matically members of GPSA.
While many of them concentrate
on graduating, some of them
overlook the importance of
representing their peers on
university committees.

(“Information from graduate
students is solicited from 30
university committees, such as
library, computer usage, athletics
and student admissions. That's
my responsibility — to make sure
that we're represented on these,”
said Mandarino, who is a mem-
ber of the Student Affairs Adviso-
ry Committee.

’’In principle, GPSA is reform-
ing the graduate government. Es-
sentially, a renaissance is taking
place,” said new president, Jim
Antaki, an engineering student,
adding that their goals are to
bring together all graduate stu-
dent organizations and instill
health into them and GPSA.

”We would be a head to a
body, a central hub to address

Students for Bush plan  

campaigning activities 

By Lou Grieco
Staff Writer

Sometimes getting started is the
hardest part. As the president of
Students For Bush, Daryl Grecich
can attest to this.

Grecich, a member of the Stu-
dent Government Board, wanted
to get involved with the Bush
campaign. When he found out
the College Republicans were not
active in the campaign, he start-
ed Students For Bush.

”When school started, Dukakis
and Bentsen were getting noticed
on campus,” Grecich said. ”We
took it upon ourselves to do
something. Now members of the
College Republicans are working
for us.”

Grecich soon found that start-
ing a new organization was a lot
of work. Before anything could
be done, Students For Bush had
to be certified as a new organiza-
tion by the university.

Soon after that, Grecich had a
meeting during which he signed
up about 100 volunteers. The
group’s first activity was a voter
registration drive.

’’I had to call people and get
them to try to sign up voters,”

D

Grecich ‘said. ”Nobody wanted
to commit themselves.” --

Grecich said that the group ha
registered about 150 new voters
as of last Wednesday. He said
that almost all of the new voters
have registered as Republicans.

Grecich said that Students For
Bush would have organized a
registration drive even if the Col-
lege Young Democrats had not.
Grecich said that he is happy
with the results of the drive be-
cause they only had a week to
run the drive, which ended last
Friday.

(Ken Haber, president of the
College Young Democrats, said

that his organization registered

over 1,000 new voters in less
than four weeks.) -

Grecich said that the next
project for Students For Bush will
be printing a pamphlet encourag-
ing people to watch the next
Bush-Dukakis debate. The group
will be watching the debate at
Pittsburgh's Republican head-
quarters.

Grecich hopes to have rallies
for Republican politicians who
campaign in the Pittsburgh area
in the future.

Death toll in Algiers riots could be as high as 200 

ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) ~ Sold-
iers fired into crowds of demon-
strators on Sunday who refused to
disperse, and police and hospital
sources said at least 200 people
had died in rioting over rising
prices and a government austeri-
ty program.

Clashes between the army and
demonstrators grew more violent
late Saturday and early Sunday.
Soldiers were ordered to shoot at
protesters who did not disperse
and fired repeatedly.

The government confirmed
deaths among security forces.

The worst violence was report-
ed in the southern and eastern
suburbs of Algiers and in the
western port city of Oran. Fight-
ing was also reported in a dozen
provincial centers.

In the capital, Algiers, army
helicopters armed with rockets
flew low, apparently to dis-
courage the formation of crowds.

The city was mostly calm. Af-
ter midday prayers at the city's
mosques, some people gathered

and chanted, ”Chadli Must Go,”
a reference to President Chadli
Bendjedid. They dispersed quick-
ly when soldiers charged.
Hospital and police sources in
various parts of the country,
providing fragmentary informa-

NEWS BRIEFS

tion, said more than 200 people
had been killed and several
hundred injured in the past five
days. The government has given
no official death toll.

From the accounts of sources,
as well as descriptions from
citizens who witnessed clashes,
it seemed likely the final death
toll could be much higher than
200.

A 26-year-old government offi-
cial, Aliouane Fadela, said she
saw gendarmes in riot gear
”charging bystanders who were
doing nothing, and then kicking
them once they were on the
ground.” The gendarmes are
police under military control.

Attempted murder
arrangements fail

PITTSBURGH (AP) — A feder-
al grand jury indicted a Mifflin
County man on charges of trying
to arrange the murder of his fed-
eral probation officer.

The grand jury alleged in an in-
dictment returned Thursday that
James P. McNeil, 47, of
Lewistown, asked an undercover
agent to kill Edward J. Kosheba,
said U.S. Attorney J. Alan
Johnson.

U.S. Magistrate Gary Lancaster
ordered McNeil to be held
without bail in the Blair County
prison in Holidaysburg. If con-
victed, he could be jailed for up
to 10 years and fined up to
$125,000.

Rabbits clubbed to
death by Boy Scouts

HARRISBURG (AP) - More
than a dozen Boy Scouts beat

rabbits with sticks and slit their
throats during a training exercise
at a recent weekend survival
camp, a newspaper reported
Sunday.

At least 10 parents and a state
Game Commission official wit-
‘nessed the act in a wooded area
near Shermans Dale, Perry
County, during a survival camp
attended last weekend by about
75 scouts from nine troops, most-
ly from Dauphin County, the
Harrisburg Patriot-News
reported.

A 12-year-old scout who wit-
nessed the killings described the
scene in detail for the newspaper.
The boy's father, however, re-
fused to let his son's story or iden-
tity be revealed.

A Harrisburg troop brought the
domesticated rabbits, which were
beaten by about 15 scouts aged
12-16, the newspaper said. The
other troops brought chickens
and killed them in a similar man-
ner. The scouts later cooked the
animals and ate them for dinner.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October l0, l988

By Sandy Paciulli
Staff Writer

The British are coming! The
British are coming! Or as
many people have noticed,
they are already here shooting
politically active Americans 
on film that is.

.3 Michael Jermey, producer of

the Independent Television
News—London, has been
traveling across the United
States with his crew, Ed Cast-
ner and Wynter Byrd, filming
various segments of this year's
presidential race for broadcast
on British airwaves.

In addition to recording the
debates and rallies, ITN is tak-
ing a special interest in the role
of the American voter. ITN has
been interviewing outspoken

minority, political, senior
citizen and college organiza-
tions. One such man is Ronald
A. Zarotney, director of the
Penn Hills Senior Citizen
Center.

On Thursday, ITN arrived in
Penn Hills to interview Zarot-
ney after reading a political
statement he made in an arti-
cle in The Washington Pos.
This statement, along with
others he soon uncovered,
ended Jermey’s search for his
segment on the ”Reagan
Democrat.”

Jermey explained that Rea-
gan Democrats are those peo-
ple (particularly the elderly,
poor, and black) who strayed
from the Democratic party in
the last election to support the

.British tune in to US election

Reagan administration, but are
now returning to the ”straight”
party ticket in the upcoming
election.

”Pittsburgh is the micro-

cosm of Reagan democrats,”

Jermey said, ”and will they de-
cide which way the election
will go?”

Jermey feels that the Reagan
Democrats will be an extreme-
ly strong force in this year's
presidential race.

Jermey explained that this
particular segment will be of
great interest to the British
viewer who is ”fascinated
with American politics.”

Jermey will continue his
coverage of the presidential
through Election Day before
returning to London.

As an example, Antaki cited the
closing of the Graduate School of
Public Health's library. He said
that if representation from stu-
dents had occurred, that could
have been averted.

”There’s some sentiment out
there to the effect of ’I don't give
a damn about GPSA. What can
they do for me?’ The welfare of
graduate life on campus is an im-
portant matter, which involves is-
sues such as security on Forbes

prove the quality of the graduate
experience,” said Antaki.
Antaki inherited GPSA from an
active nucleus of one officer and
one administrator. ’’It had come
to a screeching halt. I was the
only student to attend a publi-
cized meeting for grad student
leadership. My mind is set on get-
ting this organization and com-
munications running smoothly.”

”We’re not a troublemaker
group, but we have to lay down
some mechanism for grad stu-
dents to improve our campus
lives," said Antaki.

in game of undefeated next week  

By john Enright

Lou Holtz, Notre Dame's jocu-
lar coach, stoodoutside the visit-
ing team's locker room at Pitt
Stadium Saturday night, hard
pressed for time to savor the fifth-

‘ ranked Fighting |rish’s 30-20 win

over Pitt.

Inevitably, a question was
asked about Notre Dame's show-
down with No. 1 ranked Miami
Saturday at 1:30 in South Bend,
Ind. Suddenly, Holtz exited his
facetious mode.

“I can say in all honesty that

everybody’s talked about Miami;
everybody’s worn T-shirts about
Miami,” Holtz said, ”and I think
that's probably because they
honestly, deep in their hearts, feel
they won't be able to wear the T-
shirts after the game.
_ ”They’re an intelligent student
body and they've watched Mia-
mi ‘against Florida State. I have
not thought about Miami by any
stretch of the imagination. I know
they have a great defense, and
they beat us last year.”

Holtz isn’t tellingthe truth. Mi-
ami didn’t beat Notre Dame last

year. The Hurricanes pummelled
the Irish, 24-0. The score wasn’t
indicative of the lopsided nature
of the game. Miami churned out
417 yards to Notre Dame's 169.
Four Miami turnovers kept the
score respectable.

In 1985, Miami whipped Notre
Dame, 58-7, in.Gerry Faust’s last
game as Irish coach.

Despite the Notre Dame stu-
dent body’s preoccupation with
Miami (they wore T-shirts all last
week reading ”Beat Miami”),
Holtz says he didn’t look past Pitt,
a team that had defeated Notre

Dame the last two years, 10-9-

and 30-22.

But was Holtz worried his play-
ers would? ”No, I wasn’t,” he
said, ”and I'm not worried about
them looking past Miami, either.”

The key to Notre Dame’s vic-
tory Saturday was ball control
and stopping any Pitt hopes of
gaining momentum.

The Irish controlled the football
for 39:49, Pitt for 20:1 1. Also, the
Fighting Irish scored on their first
drive following all four Pitt scor-
ing drives.

A synopsis:

0 Pitt leads, 7-0, in the first

quarter. Notre Dame returns the
kickoff 28 yards to its 40. Pitt gets
caught in a blitz on third-and-
four, allowing Tony Brooks to
scramble 52 yards, setting up his
2-yard touchdown run.

0 Pitt scores to tie the game at
14 in the second quarter. Raghib
Ismail returns the kickoff 40 yards
to the Notre Dame 48. Seven
plays later, Reggie Ho kicks a
37-yard field goal to break the tie.

(Said Gottfried, ”Our coverage
of the kickoffs a couple times
wasn’t very good, but you have

a good team on the other side _

returning the ball.”)

0 Pitt ties the game at 17 in the
third quarter. Notre Dame starts
from its own 20. Fourteen plays
and 6‘/2 minutes later, the Irish go
on top, 23-17, on Braxton Banks’
1-yard touchdown run.

0 Scott Kaplan’s 34-yard field
goal cuts the lead to 23-20 in the
fourth quarter. Notre Dame starts
at its 35, and chews up 64 yards
in 14 plays, while taking its time
doing it (6:47). The key play --
Pitt gets called for 12 men on the
field when Notre Dame punts on
fourth-and-13 from its own 32.

Last season, Notre Dame came
into Pitt Stadium with ‘a 3-0
record and touting the eventual
Heisman Trophy winner, Tim
Brown. Pitt came out smoking
and held off a late Irish rally to
hold on for a 30-22 win.

This past Saturday, Notre
Dame visited Pitt riding a 4-0
record and a No. 5 ranking by the
Associated Press. In a game that
could have gone either way, the
Irish left, thanks to numerous Pitt
mistakes, with a 30-20 win.

’’I give Pitt great credit,” Notre
Dame coach Lou Holtz said.
”.They played exceptionally well
and are a very fine footballteam.
This win isjvery gratifying to us.”

Although Pitt came out of the
game with their third loss against
two wins, Notre Dame suffered
heavy losses of its own.

Pitt suffered the biggest blow
midway through the first quarter.
Defensive lineman Marc Spindler
sprained his knee and couldn't
return to the game. Burt Gross-
man wasstill hampered by a
sprained ankle suffered three
weeks ago and had to leave the
game a number of times. Line-
backer Ricardo McDonald,was
also less than 100.percent with a
bum ankle.

”The injuries certainly hurt us,
but that wasn’t the sole reason we
lost,” Pitt coach Mike Gottfried
said. ”We lost to a really good
football team. They are strong,
physical and have very good
team speed. Lou Holtz should be
congratulated.”

Notre Dame's biggest injuries
came on the offensive line. Start-

‘$1

ing guards Tim Ryan and Tim.
Grunhard both went down early.

”We are in severe trouble with
our offensive line,” Holtz said.
”To lose both our starting guards
is devastating. I don't believe
they'll be able to come back
against Miami [ND’s opponent
next week]/’

The biggest play came in the
fourth quarter with Notre Dame
ahead 23-20. The Pitt defense
held the Irish to negative yardage

on three plays and*forced them ,

to punt for only the second time
in the game.

Notre Dame punterlim Sexton
kicked the ball 44 yards down the
field, but a flag was thrown on
the play.

The call was too many men on
the field against Pitt. It became a
15-yard penalty when the extra
man contributed on the play. It
gave Notre Dame new life, and
they capitalized on it with a
touchdown to put the final nail in
the Panther coffin.

”That was certainly a big play
in the game,” Holtz said. ”But it's
like anything else; if you give
somebody a chance, and they are
any good, they’~are going to take
advantage of it. We were very for-
tunate in that respect.”

”The fourth quarter penalty
was certainly a key error on our
part,” Gottfried said. ”lt’s a mis-
take that just shouldn't happen.
Someone just confused a call and
we didn’t have enough time to
call a time out.”

The game started out very simi-
larly to last year's. Pitt drove ear-

« ly, but this time Notre Dame was

able to answer.
Pitt took the opening kickoff to

Dean Caliguire, Mark Step-
noski, Roman Matusz and
reserve Bill Cherpak, once
again gave a peak perfor-
mance. There is little evidence
to dispel the notion they are
among the nation’s finest.

0 Yusef Washington and
Scott Kaplan provided Pitt
with a strong kicking game.
Washington punted three
times for a 48-yard average
while Kaplan converted on
both of his field—g0al attempts
(44 and 34 yards, respective-
ly) as well as both extra-point
attempts.

0 On the defensive side of
the ball, middle |inebackerJer—
ry Olsavsky registered an in-
credible 22 tackles (11 solos
and 11 assisted) for the
Panthers.

0 Pitt freshmen outside line-
backers Curtis Bray and
Ricardo McDonald continued
to play like seasoned vets.

Bray was credited with 10
tackles, while McDonald tal-
lied nine and was. credited
with one-half of a quarterback
sack as well as tackling one
Notre Dame back for a loss.

0 A nicked-up Pitt defensive
line led by defensive tackle
Tom Sims’ eight tackles, gave
a valiant performance. The
Panthers started the game with
Burt Grossman decidedly less
than 100 percent because of
an ankle injury and lost Marc
Spindler to a sprained knee
midway through the first
quarter.

0 The Pitt defensive back’-'

field held Notre Dame quar-
terback Tony Rice to a mere
97-yards passing for the game.

0 Alonzo Hampton was
credited with seven unassisted
tackles, three for losses. He
also picked off two errant Rice
passes.

0 The most telling stat for
the game was Notre Dame's
310 yards rushing against an
injury-depleted defensive line.

their own 39-yard line. The Pan-
thers then went to the air, with
quarterback Darnell Dickerson,
who went 12 of 25 for 209 yards
on the day, connecting on three
of his first four passes to get to the
Fighting Irish 26.

The ground game took over,
and Curvin Richards (17 rushes
for 78 yards) took the ball to the
8. After the first of numerous Pan-
ther penalties (a delay-of-game
call), Richardscarried to the 2,
where he promptly dropped the
ball, and Notre Dame covered it.
End of Pitt drive.

”We could have won the
game,” Gottfried said, "but we

just made enough mistakes to,

lose it."

Notre Dame started to move
the ball, but an interception by
Pitt cornerback,AIonzo Hampton
gave Pitt the ball on their own 46.

The Panthers decided to go at
the Irish defensive backs again, as

I Dickerson hit Reggie Williams for

a 42-yard scoring strike. After the
PAT by freshman Scott Kaplan,
Pitt led 7-0.

"We tried to cover, pre-
dominately because Dickerson is
so hard to contain,” Holtz said.
”When you do that, sometimes
you'll get burned." I

The Irish came right back. Four
straight running plays put Notre
Dame in the end zone and the
game was tied.

”We did the things we were
supposed to do," Notre Dame
running back Mark Green‘ said.
”We ‘ran the ball well and kept
them off balance.”

Pitt broke away from,their pass-
ing game and gained only three
yards before Yusef Washington
was sent out to punt.

A 38-yard kick and a clipping
call on Notre Dame put the ball
on the Irish 14. The Irish mixed
passing and running to get the
ball to the Panther 2.

The Pitt defense held Anthony
Johnson out for three plays, but
a fourth down run up the gut by
Johnson put the Irish up by seven.

Pitt tied the score with six
minutes left in the second quart— '

er on a 33-yard scoring pass from
Dickerson to Henry Tuten.

”We were able to stay with our
game plan,” Tuten said. “We
were able to mix up the pass with
the a run and come away with
scores.”

Notre Dame answered the
touchdown nine plays later with
a 38-yard field goal by Reggie
Ho. The Fighting Irish led 17-14
with three minutes left in the half.

Pitt took over the ball and
drove easily down the field to the
Notre Dame 9. Dickerson took a
bootleg around right and took the
ball into the end zone for what
seemed to be the go-ahead
touchdown.

Dickerson dropped the ball be-
fore he crossed the goal line. He

but the officials ruled that he
caught the ball just beyond the
end zone. Two more passes fell
incomplete before Hodson found
Fuller at the rear of the end zone.

While LSU was scoring a dra-
matic victory, Columbia ‘was

The Losing Streak is over. The

and 44 games when Solomon
Johnson scored from the two with

The 15-yard infraction gives the
Irish a first down and new life.
The penalty takes away Pitt's last
gasp of air.

Gottfried blamed the error ”on
the coaches.” One of the guilty
parties was special teams coach
Scott O'Brien, who got an earful
from Gottfried on the sidelines af-
ter the penalty was called.

”I think that's a key error on
our part,” Gottfried said. ”You
can't have that. It kept a drive
alive instead of us having the ball.
One of our younger players
didn't come out. It’s a mistake

that should have never
happened.”
The importance of Notre

Dame's four immediate scores af-
ter Pitt points wasn't lost on
Holtz. ”We talked about the
flinch test. We talked about an-
swering challenges, and we were
‘fortunate. We did answer the
challenge each time,” he said.

With two of Pitt's top defensive
players out for most of the game
with injuries (defensive tackle
Marc Spindler and end Burt
Grossman), Gottfried was pleased
with his defense.

”We just wore down a little bit
playing with too few people on
defense. We've got to figure out
how to give some people some
rest. It seemed like [Notre Dame]
had the ball most of the day,”'he
said.

Notre Dame is now 5-0, but
Holtz’s team enters Miami with
a depleted offensive’ line.

I Starting guards Tim Ryan and
Tim Grunhard were injured in
the game against Pitt. Neither is
expected to play against Miami.
And this is the same offensive line
that began the season with five
new starters. I

”We are not a really good foot-
ball team. gWe're not a complete
football team. We're going to

have to struggle. I really am con-

cerned,” Holtz said.

The Notre Dame players didn't
show much concern. after the
game. But most players were ex-
pressionless and reserved when
talking about Miami.

”Each week, we start from
scratch," said linebacker Michael
Stonebreaker. ”Everybody on the
team is mature enough to under-
stand that. It has to be a week-to-
week thing for us to achieve our
goals; That's what we did last
week. That's the same thing we'll
do this week.”

Said Banks, ”Pitt’s been on our
minds since last Sunday morning.
Miami won't be on our minds un-
til this Sunday morning [yester-
day]. We're just trying to
celebrate the win."

Now, it's Monday; the celebra- .

tion is over, and preparation for

Miami is in day number two.

Pitt went back to the run and
drove down to the Notre Dame
27, where Kaplan tied the game
at 17 with a 44-yard field goal.

the attitude that the seniors never
beat these guys and we wanted
to play our type of football. Do
the things we have done in the
first four games,” Green said.

Braxton Banks carried the ball.
Banks left with a knee injury earli-
er in the season and wasn’t ex-
pected to _play.

’’I planned on playing this
game,” Banks said. ”We have a
few nagging injuries in our back-
field, and I knew those guys
would need some help. They
played a great game, and I was
happy to be able to contribute.”

Pitt came right back with a
34-yard Kaplan field goal to cut
the lead to three.

The Panther defense seemed
fired up after the score. They held
Notre Dame to negative yardage
on three plays and forced them
to punt. Then came the 12-man
penalty. The game was over after
that.

”We’re cutting down on the
mistakes, but they are still hap-
pening on occasion,” Olsavsky
said. ”We’re going to have to get
over that hump.”

”We are going to go out,
celebrate and have fun,” Green
said. ’’It feels really good to win
this game.”

The Panthers stay home to play
Temple this Saturday at 1:30 p.m.
Notre Dame returns to South
Bend to play the No. 1 ranked
Miami Hurricanes at 2:30 p.m.
