WEDNESDAY, NOV. 15, 1972,

The Black Studies Department,
its philosophy, and its meaning to
black students at Pitt were the
major areas discussed at the
“Presentation by the Department
of Black Studies" Monday at 3 in
the SU Ballroom. The presenta-
tion was part of the Black Week
activities this week, sponsored
by the Black Action Society.

Jack Daniel, a professor in the
Black Studies Department, spoke
of the department as being “about
preparing people to live a certain
lifestyle.” Terming the Universi-
ty a “mental prison,” Daniel said
the Black Studies Department is

, "about breaking out of all that"

and stressed the need for alterna-
tive Nays of thinking and living.

“There is nothing else in the
U.S. called black studies that is
qualitatively or quantitatively bet-
ter than this,” said Daniel about
the department, which offers a
B.A. and is -planning a doctoral
program. It is staffed by 16 full
time faculty members and offers
35 to 40 courses per semester in
the Humanities, Social Sciences,
and African, and Carribean
Studies Program.

The audience of about 50 peo-
ple, almost entirely black. heard
Daniel talk about the importance
of “real action” invgtheform of
CUI11l1lullll_V projects and the ne-
cessity of cbmmuunication among
black people through media like
Black Lines, the departments
newspaper. He also elaborated on
the advantages of an exchange
student program with Africa and
the Carribean which is partially
underway in the department.

Curtiss Porter, who took the

podium next, centered his re-
marks on the contradiction in
black American’s lives of “trying
to do something black within
something white." This contradic-
tion, he said, gives the black
American a “double conscious-
ness” which views the world from
the black perspective ‘and the
white perspective.

This position, explained Porter,
also a professor in the Black
Studies Department, can either
give the American black a de-
pressed outlook, the “blues,” or it
can precipitate a “heavy con-
sciousnessf’ which places him on
the “vanguard of society.” Black
Studies, as a “continuing idea”
whose structure must reflect the
society, Porter continued, re-

flects this positive side of double
consciousness. The contention is
that anyone who sees a society
from two viewpoints knows more
about that society than the mon-
istic individual, and can use that
knowledge to bring about change.

Porter credited the efforts of
the Black Action Society as being
a major factor in the struggle to
establish a Black Studies Depart-
ment in 1968. The result of ‘these
and other efforts, he said, has
been the creation of a true Black
Studies program at Pitt, and not

just the “jive" of a few black his-

tory courses.

The speakers were followed by
a question and answer period and
a panel discussion, entitled “Black
People: Where to from Here."

Black Week Activities Begin Annual March Festivals

In Planning Stages

by LARRY PANSINO
The _,organizers of the two an-
nual March festivals, Greek Week
and Engineers’ Week, have re-

- luctantly merged their concert

programs for the first time.

Tighter allocations was given as -

the. major reason for the consoli-
dation in programming.

. The Allocations Committee ob-
jected to funding two separate
concerts one week apart and sug-
gested that the two groups share

~ the’ same entertainment. How-

ever, both Greeks and engineers
have ‘expressed misgiving over
the joint concert; seating, sched-
uling, and recognition are the ma-
jor problems.

' Pitt Installs Information Bank

The nations first computerized
hookup with the New York Times
Information Bank has been in-
stalled on the campus.

The experimental installation of
the electronic information re-

trieval system, the cost of which‘

' was underwritten by The Times,
"will make it possible for Pitt stu-

dents, faculty, and researchers to
speedily probe the vast files of the
New York Times from a“ remote
terminal located on campus. In-
stallation of the system is com-
plete, but ‘experimentation with
the equipment is expected to de-
lay full service operation until
early December.

Environment Pittsburgh 

Battle With Pollution

by JOHN A. CAPITMAN
"What we're doing is not par-
ticularily revolutionary. "but just
the very act of getting people in-
volved in controlling their own
lives has profound revolutionary

effects,“ claims David Marshall-

of Environment: Pittsburgh.

He talked with me on Sunday
morning from the back porch of
his Squirrel Hill apartment—with
a restless anxiety that made one
not only conscious of the almost
ominipresent power of the large
corporations but of the reality of
living in a city like Pittsburgh
while there are still open forests

, and untouched mountains.

‘O
V,

 

Marshall seems aware of these
environmental dichotomies—the
cities and the open land, how the
rivers are and how they could and
must be. He’s the kind of modern
man who has sought refuge in the
Far West of this country and
seeks’ it periodically by walking

among the straggling trees of-

Frick Park.

Marshall comes from Lancas-
hire in England. where he was
"born and brought up in the
Northwest among snail dingy
towns surrounded by dull and fog-
ged noors." He attended the Lon-
don School of Economocs—-some-
how reliving the whole classical
economists existance of Ricardo

/ll

 

   

and »/lalthus. '

Then he came to the U.S. with
his wife——to another polluted
place, Chicago. There he received
his .Vl.A. in Trade and Develop-
mental Economics. From there
he went to New York where he
worked for the United Nations on
their World Trade Survey.

Marshall felt then that the
United States “was a much more
lively place, though barbaristic;
things like photographers sticking
their cameras in the faces of cry-
ing people.”

New York was exciting at fins)‘.
but after two years he "couldn‘t
get up in the morning." In 1966.
he got a job with the Consat Re-
search Corporation in Pittsburgh.
doing systems analysis on trans-
portation in the Boston, Washing-
ton corridor.

Three years of Pittsburgh, and
inco nplete data were frustrating.
so in 1969 the environmentalist
took off t'or the tVest_of this coun-
try. to think about what he could
do to change the life-Style. not
only his family and friends. but.to
improve the quality of physical
world to} as many people as he
could.

Traveling through that partial-
ly unadulterated land lead toia

was started in 1966 to provide the
paper’s reporters with computer-
ized access to news that has ap-
peared in The Times over the
years and to selected material
from other publications. The Pitt
installation is the first extension
of the system outside The Times’
New York offices, although plans
now are under way to install are-
mote terminal in the paper’s bu-
reau in Washington, D‘. C.

The Pitt installation is under
the auspices of the University's
Office of Communications Pro-
grams. Professor Allen Kent. di-
rector of Communication ‘ Pro-

. grams at Pitt, and Dr. John Roth-

man, director of Information
Services at the New York Times,
are in charge of the program.

When the >'.\'SleII‘l" is "fully oper-
ational. the information provided
to users of the Pitt access term-
inal will be current within 72
hours of publication. Initially. it
will provide access only to those
issues of The Times which date
back to 1970. but ultimately the
data base will cover the contents
of The Times morgue, which ex-
tends back to about 1900.

The terminal has been placed
on the ground floor of Pitt’s Hill-
man Library in a glass-enclosed
area just off the main entrance.

The computer, through mess-
ages displayed on the screen. will
give the user step-by-step direc-
tions for conducting his informa-
tion search, In effect, it will ask
him, “What is your question?" or
“What is your topic?"

'l‘here may be thousands of rel-
erences under any given topic. and
the computer will ask the user if
he wants the search limited by
geography, by date. or by some
other criterion until the search
area has been narrowed suffici-

ently for. the system to begin dis- .

playing abstracts of relevant New
York Times articles on the
screen.‘

Having scanned the abstracts
on the display screen, the user
may opt either to secure a print-
ed copy of these abstracts as they
were displayed on the screen,
and/or to insert a microfiche of
the complete text of the article
into the reader-printer machine,

 

. which will allow him hothto read;

 

the article in microfiche and,
with the push of a button, to se-
cure a printed copy of it.

According to Kent, while tu-
torials and workshops may be
needed initially to teach people
to use the terminal, the proce-
dure ultimately will be so simple
that anyone will be able to sit at
the keyboard and carry out a
search of the data band with the
help of the computerized instruc-
tions.

The information system is ex-
pected to be useful to Pitt stu-
dents, faculty, and researchers
in a wide range of disciplines. but

To Reduce Deficit

Snack Bar Reviewed I‘ 1 

In the past, both organizations’
have separately sold out the 3,800-
seat Syria Mosque, site of both
concerts. Presently,
number of Greeks and engineers
is between 2,200 and 2,400.

Student Government has 'de— 

creed that no advance ticket sales‘
be made to either group so that

other students have equal access _ 

to them. A heavy rushﬂon these

tickets may be expected once they 

become available.

Two circumstances should

those two weeks in March, and a

The concert is scheduled for 4 ,

Because the Tower B snack bar is losing“ between $500 and $600 a 
month. a study is being made to determine what can be done éboutit, '
according to Donovan Hughes, Associate Director of Housing.

Hughes explained that the snack bar has been a loser financially  L
the last couple‘ of years partly because of curfews being lifted. Before . 

I

there were Curfews, Hughes said, students weren’t allowed out of the
dorms after certain hours so they were forced to go to the Tower B‘
snack bar for food. Now students go out of the dorms for snacks. {

Hughes added that another reason the snack bar was losing money  f ‘E
was because there was no place for students to sit to eat the food they  ..

purchased. Because of this 25 tables with chairs to seat 100 people were

added to the Tower B lobby.

According to Hughes the snack bar was losing between $900 and  1

Jim "
Stana, Central Planning Chair- 
man for Engineering Student Cab.-('1

it not being considered a com-” ’
bined concert. I fear that we’ll

Meanwhile, the engineers are: A i

$1.100 a month last year. but with a decrease in the hours it is open and ,
the added chairs the deficit has been reduced considerably.

At the Student Government meeting last Thursday the subject was‘ 

discussed. and the Women's Housing Board and the Men's Dorm Loun-
cil decided to look into the possibility of managing the snack bar. If
this doesn’t work out there is also the possibility of putting in vending ,

machines.

Hughes believes that if the high cost of union labor could begot-
ten around by manning the snack bar with students or replacing labor
entirely with vending machines the deficit could be reduced even rnore.

If the students decide to -take it over, Szabo has already agreed ver-
bally to supply the food at the cost of purchase. Hughes, however, is
cautioning the students to look-into the problems of managing the

snack bar before taking it over.

He stated that when it comes down to the actual staffing of the g" 

snack bar on weekends there may be problems. _

In relation to the talk of making the snack bar a "senior bar." '77;
-Hughes said, “That I don't see as a possibility." He added that it would
be difficult controling the sale of liq

Action Recruits At Pitt

Jerry Gorman was a Peace
Corps volunteer for two years in
Cameroon, training teachers of
English as a foreign language. He
also taught l~'i'enc-ll and cross cul-
tural studies to new volunteers.

Neither VISTA-nor the Peace
Corps is a training program.
They want, and require, volun-
teers who already have skills-and
the ability and desire to share
them with people who share nei-
ther their language nor their her-
itage. Frustration is offered as an
integral part of the job.

Certain skills are especially
sought: Teaching, Architecture,
Business, Engineering, Regional
Planning, Law, Health Profes-
sions, Administration, Nursing,
and most important, Practical
Agriculture.

Volunteer preference starts at

the ‘top. Nurses with a B.S. are
preferred—if positions remain,
HN’s will be considred. Doctor-
ates are preferred in most pro-

— fessional areas, though less qual-

ified persons will be considered if
not all positions are filled.

Farming and practical techno-
logy are the heart of the Peace
Corps, hopefully coupled with the
ability to train individuals who
have had marginal schooling.
VISTA needs volunteers who can
recognize and solve (on a mini-
mal budget) the problems of poor
or disadvantaged Americans,
both rural and urban. Their work
is about evenly divided between
central city and depressed rural
areas.

The pay range is in the area of
$125 per month, higher if neces-

The Nine Mile Run project was
coordinated by Marshall and

Corps represented a form of cul-
tural imperialism.

“Sometirnes it seems like it
should work that way. But among
people whose culture is thou-
sands of years old, one volunteer

ence. All we can do is help them
technically, and we have to spend

do that.”

According to the calendar, it’s
Friday night, Nov. the 10th, 1972.
But in the Schenley Recreation
Area the clock has been turned
back and you could be entering
the Apollo Ballroom sometime
in the 30’s.

It’s the scene of the first an-
nual Student Dance Marathon, an
event dreamed up by the Public
Affairs Committee of the Student
Union Board and a University
first.

The contest is set to begin at
9 p.m. and end at 8 a.m., 11 hours
later.

. The time is 8:52 and the parti-
cipants names are being read off.

One girl needs a male partner
and a‘ hesitant boy is‘ shoved by
his friends into the girl’s arms,

The time is near. 5-4-3-2-1.

The contestants surge onto the
dance floor.

“Yowsa! Yowsa! Yowsa!
We’re gonna do it tonight.

Throughout the night rumors
circulate among the spectators.
“Number 43 is a professional
dancer,” “that girl is full of stim-
ulants,” “that one is pregnant,”
and on and on and on.

It’s 12:50, almost four hours
from starting time, only seven

' couples have been eliminated.

A new group'has picked up
where the starting band left off
and the tempo continues unbrok-
en.

The contestants display a mul-
tiple variety of dancing techni-
ques. At first everyone was

i

 

twitching, twirling, swirling,
jumping, spinning, and jerking
right along with the music. Now
many have mellowed to a simple
process of shifting their weight
from one foot to another. ‘

"Let the revolving gl_obe of mir-
rors chase away your fears’?

Both of the dancing areas are
surrounded by lines of spectators.
The fire marshall warns, “Occu-
pancy by more than 200 is un-
lawful and dangerous,” but the
ticket taker lost count long ago.
Besides there’ve been no prob-
lems and everyone is having a
great time. .—

The Campus_Police think it’s
perhaps the biggest turnout for a
campus function this term, ex-
cluding movies.

"‘Just feel the energy in the air
folks. There’s as much energy
‘» "here as in an atombomb.”

A Column and a half

By JOHN WETCALFE

. I am considering the possibility of never again mentioning the
,subject of hitchhiking even in conversation with my most intimate
.1 friends and acquaintances. The subject seems to be as emotionally
--‘loaded as busing, and inspires people to write vaguely disquieting
‘letters. One female (she assured me she was not a lady, and would
Stake it unkindly if I called her one) took exception to my mention-
ring that very few female drivers stopped when I was hitchhiking.
She commenced with a few personalslurs on my style and charac-
ter, and went on to an enumeration of the risks and dangers women
;_face when hitching or when giving rides. Just off-hand, she
5 managed to slander the entire masculine gender.

.— If this were in Spanish, I would use feminine articles exclu-
, sively, no matter how odd it might look.

One last word on the subject. Anyone planning to hitchhike in
TEngla’nd in the future can get some useful practice thumbing left-

hey might go two-way any week now. Left-handed hitching on a

  Rubbing It In

ter during the campaign, I have
come to feel that Eagleton’s men-
tal health problems were nothing
compared to those of. his succes-
sor.

I have noticed that some of
you» continue to wear your Mc-
Govern campaign buttons. The
campaign’s over, it’s time to
come out of the dream world
you’ve been living in for 22
months. Your buttons are now
every bit as useful as Goldwater
buttons, but symbolize a lost
cause that suffered a more in-
glorious defeat. '

Remember when I suggested
that if McGovern should lose,
he start a TV show about a
WWII bomben plane, starring
him as pilot, and a host of liberal
Democrats as the crew? Well,
on the day after the election, I
contacted all three major net-
works and told them my idea.
They refused to consider the
explaining that McGov-
ern’s telethons already have set
TV ‘ back 20 years and, at pre-
sent, .TV has too many shows
starring losers.

In closing, I have no condol-
ences to offer you: but merely
a recommendation. Since George
McGovern’s ideas were right for
you, but wrong for America,
wrong for the Democrats, and
just plain wrong, do one thing:
from now’ on, instead of working
WITHIN _ the system, work‘
WITHOUT the system. For the
good of the country you love so
much.

Letters to the Editor

Dear Editor:

I would appreciate having the
enclosed letter published in the
Pitt News. Since I feel a paper
should also contain praise as
well as criticism; the enclosed
letter deserves to be made pub-
lic. '

Mr. Joseph Gill
Superintendent of the
University Police Department
University of Pittsburgh
Varsity Hall

Pittsburgh, Pa. 15213

Dear Superintendent Gill:

I would like to write a long
over due letter of thanks to three
of your excellently trained pat-
rolmen. They are: Patrolman Jer-
ry Brown, Patrolman Sam Car-
zell and Patrolman Fred Schan-
bacher.

To make a rather long, compli-
cated story short I will only
briefly mention what happened
prior to 4 P.M., September 22,
1972. At 9 A.M. that morning I
had a rather hard fall all the
way down my basement steps.
After realizing nothing was brok-
en and I seemed only badly bruis-
ed, I didn’t bother going to the
hospital for a check up.

I went to the Library to do
some research and while trying
to locate information in the per-
iodical section on the 4th floor of
Hillman, Mrs. Stevenson, super-
visor of periodicals asked me if
I felt alright. I replied that I
was feeling slightly dizzy and
she suggested I sit down while
she called for help. Unfortunately

all the ambulances were on calls ‘

and Patrolman Schanbacher, who
was on duty in the library at the
time came up and reassured me
help was coming. This was about
4 P.M. and I was becoming
more and nore lightheaded. When
Patrolman Brown arrived on the
scene I guess I was pretty well
out of it. The following events
I found out later because by
that time I had passed out. I
was told that Patrolman Brown
carried me down the elevator,
while giving me mouth to mouth
resuscitation at the same time
because I had stopped breath-
ing. They continued this until
I was put on the stretcher and
put into the ambulance and ad-
ministered oxygen. 1 was then

‘taken to Presbyterian Hospital

and the emergency staff took
over from there.

Without the patrolmen’s excel-
lent training and quick response
this incident could have resulted
in two orphaned children mine
—: ages 13 and 11 and I would not
be writing this letter. I can’t
cease to be amazed at the skills
of your wonderful men.

I feel I owe them my life and
I'have no other way to repay
them other than to say -“Thank
you and God bless you.”

I thank you for having such a
great police force and I am sure
you are due some of the credit
for. giving the excellent training
required and hiring such highly
qualified men.

A I get quitetired reading critics,

about the Campus Police in the
Pitt News and feel more people
who have had the luck to be
helped bx these men (this in-
cludes the whole force) speak out.
People are always quite ready to
criticize but seem to forget to
say “Thank You” when they re-
ceive help. ' '

Again I will say Thank You,
from the bottom of my heart
to Patrolman Brown, Patrolman
Carzell and Patrolman Schan-
bacher for the wonderful job
you did for me.

Very Sincerely Yours,

Dear Editor:
The Mother School is gone.

Of course I don’t expect you
to know what I’m talking about,
not even if you’re Lithuanian. I
don’t expect you to remember
that tiny wooden carving even
if you ever had a class in the
Lithuanian Nationality room.
But maybe if you ever took a
tour of the Nationality Rooms
with one of (us in Quo Vadis,

you might remember what the ~

mute image of the lady teaching
a child from a book was saying
so eloquently.

For the rest of you, the mess-
age was that, since the begin-
ning of its present enslavenent,
Lithuania has been forbidden to
use its own language. Only Rus-
sians may be taught, and dis-
obedience is strictly dealth with.
The mother of the carving was
secretly teaching her son to read
his own language from a smug-
gled book printed in Lithuanian.

Someone put a lot of artistic
talent into that little carving,
and it showed. Local Lithuanians
put their hard-earned money into
it in order to display it in the
room the University allowed
them to build, atptheir own ex-
pense.

But, as I say, the Mother
School is gone. The back of the
plastic display case on the radi-
ator was slit open, the case lift-
ed, the statuette broken off from
its base, and—verschwund.

We of Quo Vadis, and the Na-

tionality Rooms Committees, are

so sick of these rip-offs under our
noses; we are‘ so sick of watching
you smoke in the Nationality
rooms. in ‘arrogant defiance of
the posted signs; we are so sick
of you faculty members who not
only fail to tell your classes that
eating and drinking are not per-
-mitted in the rooms, but do it
yourselves . . . .

But I direct my message now
to the thief,’ Mr. Creep: A stereo
or something useful I could un-
derstand, but a work _of art?
Since it will be hard for you. to
sell the .\/[other School in this
area due to its easy identifiabil-
ity, and since I won’t flatter you
with the presumed possibility
that _you took it because you
have any capacity to appreciate
good art, I will assume that you
ripped it off with the intention
of manufacturing toothpicks from
it. So all I have to say to you
now, you burn, is that you should
only get splinters.

of advice that makes Milky Ways

Anarchy is what hitchhiking’s
all about. Anyone who tries it as
a substitute for the local bus sys-
tem has rocks in his head for try-
ing to beat that system with his
thumb. Might as well stick it
up your ass. I always deferred
the decision of where I am going
until I get there, saying: “Well,
this must be the place” or “Now
where the hell am 1?” Anyone
who thumbs and doesn’t admit
the possibility of ending up in
Albequerque even if his point
of departure is South Aiken head-
in‘ for the Cathedral might as
well clean up his act, put on a
suit, and go to work as a ship-

the time you spend flagging
rides. As for legalities, rules of
the road, courtesies and written
pointers — ain’t going to matter
a damn if they decide to Start

not do yourself a favor and buy

Pittsburgh Pete Strikes *Again- .

Mums the Word of Flower Show

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

The glorious autumnal foliage
of Western Pennsylvania is now
upon the ground and it is with ut-
ter regret that we must report
that the fate of Pittsburgh’s Fall
Flower Show has fallen to a com-
parable plane as well.

By decree of our Lord High Ma-
yor (as he would probably have us
think of him in light of his horti-
cultural histrionics), the annual
show, so long associated with
Phipps Conservatory, has been
transferred with lamentable re-
sults to the cramped and unap-
propriate quarters of our City-
County Building’s main gallery.

Not surprisingly, a decline in
the quantity and quality of flowers
has accompanied this years eta!-
age. Even though an impressive
number of 4,000 cl1rysanthe-
mums has been assembled, dis-
appointment comes quickly in re-
gard to the overall attempt. Mums
and more mums are found every-
where in sight, but there is little
imagination reflected in ‘any of the

A arrangements. A lone fountain

u and a sparing number of trees at-
tempt to break the monotony of
rows and rows of flowers with lit-
tle success.

Redeeming the otherwise de-
pressing character of the floral
display is the effect of its sur-
roundings. While the neo-classical
columned efforts of the gallery

« would hardly make Pericles hap-

py, there is a certain grandeur in- ,

herent in its_ spaciousness and its
painted ceiling. If it inspires no
one to anything else, the flower
show may at least provide the
impetus for citizens to view one
of the more successful architect-
ural attempts in their city.

3., It all seems utterly insane to
many enthusiasts that the show
was moved from its spacious and
well-appointed headquarters in
Schenley Park in the first place.
In this regard, we can do nothing
more than reinterate our mayor’s
“humanitarian” wish that the

display of flora be easily acc'esi-
ble to the varieties of fauna dwell-
mg in downtown office buildings.

And while our mayor’s altru-
ism may leave many speechless
in one way or another, his lack of

aesthetic sensibility will not be ’

passed over here.

Quite frankly, Flaherty has al-
most singlehandedly destroyed
the Fall Flower Show. Its former

THE FLORA and fauna of city hall.

magnificence has been wantonly
vandalized; the variety of flow-
ers has disappeared (What of all
those exotic orchids?), the artis-
tic arrangements forgotten, and
the careful classification com-
pletely ignored.

_We have a mayor who evidently
wants his name upon the office
door of the city horticulturist at
Phipps Conservatory as well as
upon his office door at the city
hall. Flaherty should stay in his

office at city hall and putter‘ in '

his own garden, or remain within
the confines of his latest acquisi-
tion, the Pittsburgh Zoo; rather
than continue to disturb the ef-
forts of others.

Then and only then will such
events as the Fall Flower Show be
permitted to blossom without in-
terruption. One can only wonder
what”sort of garden repellant will
prove effective against Pitts-
burgh’s newest garden pest.

prizes (such as free passes to all
Pitt movies, tickets to Black
Week, gift certificates from local
merchants, records, and the like)
are given to those couples whom
the wandering judges single out.
Categories include: Teamwork,
Endurance, Body Movement,
Style, Variety, and Maintenance
of Tempo. - '

“If you’ve got a favorite couple,
give them your support. Let them

‘know that you’re pulling for them '-

to "finish on top of this writhing
struggling mass of humanity."

Approximately 65 couples en-
tered the event but through the
hours the natural process of elim-
ination has taken its toll. About
two-thirds of the contestants have
fallen victim to fatigue.

There are about two hours to go
and the rules get more strict in
the home stretch. There are no
breaks during the last two hours
of dancing and all must keep a
steady tempo.

The judges are relentless in
their scrutiny and even the slight-
est flaw, a misstep or wavering

in movement is enough to send

an exhausted pair off the floor.

and out of the running.

An ambulance is outside wait- I

ing, prepared to receive any fatal-
ities of the competition.

At last the final moments are
upon us.

Sixty seconds!

Thirty seconds! Ten seconds!‘

5-4-3-2-1. '

There are about 18 couples left. ‘i

on the floor. But when the judges
confer and the scores are tallied

only three couples share the win, 

place, and show slots.
Third place goes to couple No.

55, “Pooch” and Pat Ford. The
second prize is given to No. 26, ‘-

Gary. Blair and Kathy Yourish.

And the top of the heap firstprize’ ~

winners of this test of endurance

and talent is‘ couple No. 21, Stan‘ 

Dupell and Karen Ritchie.

Did you think you were going to,
win?

“Hell no! We entered just to 
see if we could make it to the 

end.”
"It feels pretty good to win."

“We hope to use the game as
an opportunity for the fans to
' get acquainted with the squad
in an informal way.“

There are a lot of new Pitt
faces this year, but there are also
a number of new rules the Rid]-
men will have to adhere to once
the season get’s under way.

The actual game will get un-
der way at 8:00, but Ridl will
turn master-of-ceremonies at
7:30. Ridl will address the fans
in attendance about the new foul,
charging, blocking, and travel-
ing regulations that were put into
effect after last season.

After that half hour of enlight-
' enment, Ridl will turn his 20
hoopsters loose on one another.

“It won’t be a strategy game,”
Ridl noted. “They will play a
basic one-on-one defense against
our basic offensive plays. It will
be a highly enthusiastic game

 With the West Penn championship neatly tucked away and no
chance to receive an invitation to the regional NCAA playoffs, it
may seem that Friday's contest with Penn State will be an unevent-
.t?_i“il’"one for- the Pitt Soccer Team. Pitt is definitely the underdog
but-will be sky high for the 1:30 game at Pitt Stadium.

the record. to prove it. Penn State will‘ carry a perfect‘ 9-0
_c_5rd'.int‘o thematch with wing over West Virginia,’ Army, Navy,
Wgesft Chester and Temple, just to name a few. Last year Penn State
e'_i‘it'-“to_the quarterfinals of the NCAA playoffs, defeating St. ‘Jo-
seph’s_ and Pennsylvania before falling to Howard the eventual

champions. —

fWith .seven starters and nine of ten goal scorers returning from
__s’t year’s squad, Penn State will bring a powerfuloffense to meet a
stingy Pitt defense. The 1971 season found the . Lions scoring 45
“goals with only one being netted by a senior.

/'_iAndy Rymarczuk will lead the State attack. Rymarczuk scored
1_4,goals last year and tallied four assists. Chris Bahr and Rick'Allen
are also Lions to watch. Bahr found the back of the nets 12 times
last\year and recorded, six assists while Allen scored eight goals and
£ive‘assists. /
" A 1971 All-American honorable. mention .of selection, Rymarc—
_k scored two fourth quarter goals against Pennsylvania in the
‘Wcond round of‘ the NCAA playoffs to lead his team to a 2-1‘ upset
last‘ year. RymarczaZ:"s winning goal came with only 31 seconds to
beplayed. ' K ‘

 .Gary .VIacMath is the probable starter for Penn State in goal.
Mac.)/lath h-as been the Lion‘s netminder for the past two years and
b‘oasts_a carrier goals-allowed average of 1.65, while recording five
shutouts coming into the 1972 season. ’

' Pitt will rest their upset hopes on their defensive crew and the
~ goaltending of Bill Haines. Haines has four shutouts to his credit
this year and boasts a goals against average of 1.00 in ten games.

 “There’s no way Penn State is going to get past our defense,”
Haines remarked. “They beat West Virginia 6-4, but the game was
played in the mud and some of the goals bounced off fullbacks in
front of the net.”

_. Senior Joe Luxbacher will.be playing in his last game for Pitt.
Luxbacher is the leading scorer on the team with 13 goals and is
the most powerful offensive weapon on the front line.

.;.-.,Penn State coach Herb Schmidt is primarily concerned with
liifspdefense and stated, 'We- lost key individuals, both offensively
'a§_Id defensively. But our main concern will be developing the de-
fénse. We know we have the scorers.” i

 Even though Pitt has dropped four important contests to Tem-
pie, -Akron, Cleveland State and West Virginia but could redeem the
‘s',eason_ with a victory on Friday. A win over Penn State will not
'r'1_i_.ean anything nore than a self accomplishment to Pitt, but” Coach

because the players will be out to
show me what they can do and
excell in front of the spectators.” u

Ridl couldn’t speculate on
what kind of turnout the game
would" draw, but the gleam in
his eye seemed to hint that a
large throng would be a won-
derful way to send his athletes
off into its challenging year.

To make it easier for Pitt stud-
ents to attend the game, special
shuttle buses will begin leaving
for the Field House at 6:30 p.m.
The buses will depart from the
Forbes Avenue side of the Stud-
ent Union and will return there
‘/2 hour after the game is over.
Admission will be ‘free withuan
ID card and $1 for all others.

Largo Florida, will,be announc-

don a Pitt uniform will draw the
curious eye of everyone in at-
tendance. .

“Everyone’s got to be tired of
losing, 1, just hope we can do
better.” .

Panther fullback Dave Janasek
is part of that_ ‘everyone’ who is

tired of losing. and after having I

to indure a 1-10 grid season so
far this year, it’s easy to under-
stand.

“We didn't expect anything like
this before the season began, we
expected to do better than this,”
related Janasek. “The breaks
didn’t go our way and then there
were the .injuries. »

“The team just couldn't get a
complete game together,” he con-
tinued. “The offense would play
a good game one dayand then the.
defense would play ‘a good game

game was the only game when

we were able to put everything -

together and win.”

Janasek did not participate in
last Saturday afternoon’s 28-13
loss to the Midshipmen of Navy.
The Thursday before the Navy
contest the Panther gridder in-
jured his ankle during practice.

“I didn’t play because I had
gotten hurt in practice; I wasn’t'
there so I couldn’t see it and I
'haven’t seen the films as of yet,
but it didn’t sound too good,"
commented Janasek on the last,

V of" the Panthers many disasterous

showings.

If Janasek is disappointed in
the performance of the Pitt team
so far this season, he is not over-
enthused with his own perform-
ance.

"I’d describe my performance
as being adequate,” stated the
Pitt fullback. “I‘ve done good
sometimes and I’ve done bad.
sometimes, but I‘ve done noth-

should also grab their share of
gawks. Both Richards and Starr
were tabbed as two of thetop
50 recruits out of last year’s high
school crop in Street and Smiths
basketball magazine.

All the regulars will take bows
too, not to mention Bill Knight,
who needs no introduction to
knowing basketball lovers.

The game will come after four
weeks of gruelling practice. Fran,
Webster and Tim Grgurich. as
well as

Ridl.

      

have handled the.

ma. 

Panthers during that period. Web-
ster has handled
(jrgurich the offense, and Hidl
has served as overseer.

“I think the new coaching set-
up has given us good supervision
of our group,” Buzz related.

When the Field House begins
to empty after tonight’s game. a
-lot of concerned Pitt rooters will
have some opinions formed, after
doing some supervision of their
own. -

SLICK SAM FLEMMING, both on and off the basketball court,
seems to be contemplating his next move with the ball in one of last
year’s games. Sam, along with the rest of the Cat hoop squad, can
be seen live tonight at the Field House, starting at 7:30 p.m.

Janasek Tired Of Losing

“Before the start of the season
Ijust hoped that when I got in
I would‘ do myibest,” he added.
“I didn’t expect _to start but I
made up my mind that when I
was called on I would do the
best I could.”

Janasek is hoping to see action
on the football - field one more
time this season when the‘ Pan-
thers confrontthe Nittany Lions
of Penn State. His injury should
be sufficiently recovered for him
to be available for play this Sat-
urday. V

"Penn State is good, there s no
doubt about that,” said Janasek.
“We should play a good game
against» them‘. It depends on the
mental attitiide. It’s going ‘to be

like against West Virginia — a,

lot of the guys’ friends will be

~,,playing.-and you always want to
the next"*week-—.‘ The Boston College’ -' ' '

do good"against people you know.’-’
Whether Janasek sees any ac-
tion in the Penn State game or
not, the sophomore fullback will
be active in Pitt football for a

As part of Pitt‘s annual Black
Week, the Black Action Society
honored Pitt’s outstanding senior
black athletes on Monday night.
-Feature speaker for the occasion
was the Pittsburgh Steelers- back-
up quarterback, Joe Gilliam.

Gilliam, a 21-year-old rookie
from Tennessee State University,
is trying to become one of the first
blacks to make it in the National
Football League as a quarterback.

When Ter_ry Hanratty suffered
an ankle injury midway through
the season, Gilliam. who had to
beat out veteran Bob Leahy to
make the taxi squad, was called
up to. the main team.

Gilliam spoke about what he
wentthrough to make it this far.
“If I’m a success, my formula
will be my positive thinking,” he
noted. “There’s still a lot for me
to learn,” he added. “And all I

‘ can say to the young people is to

listen to what your parents tell
you, because that’s what’s hap-
pening.”

Gilliam had a few words of ad-
vice for the many Pitt football

,\ players in attendance. “Every -
-  time they kick your butt, get back

up and say, ‘I’m going to make
it‘)?! v

Also speaking at the affair was
Alfred Moye, Dean of the Student
Affairs. Moye gave credit to the

Pitt player for never giving up
and for fighting in the final min-
utes, even-though Pitt generally
found itself on the losing end of
most of its games.

“The black athlete plays a tre-
mendous role in the black com-
munity,” he added. “The young
‘people look up to you.’,’ '

Following the speeches, Gil-
liam presented certificates to the
athletes. Among those honored
were, from football, Reggie Frye,
Joe Herndon, and Ernie Webster;
-from basketball, Marvin Abrams
and Carl Morris; from baseball,
Ed Kelly; from wrestling, Lamar
Hutson.

The basketball players were
not present, as they were practic-
ing with the team, and all people

Singled Out by Black Action Society

BAS Honors Seniors

who attended the ceremonies
were urged to show their support
for the hoopers at the intra-squad
game which is being played at the
Field House tonight at 8 p.m.

Also given recognition was
coach Willie Jeffries from the
football team. Jeffries has been
especially popular with most of
the players on the team, both
black and white.

Among the athletes in the au-
dience helping to honor the sen-
iors were Jim Buckmon, Claire
Wilson, and Pittsburgh Steeler-
Dwight White.

Webster, upon receiving his
award, thanked the Black Action
Society for helping Pitt‘s athletes
achieve their goals here at the
University. “The situation has
‘improved, but we still have a long

4 way to go.”

Each athlete honored by the
BAS received a certificate em-.
blematic of the occasion and were
wished good luck intheir future
professions.

Several of those honored, not-

ably Frye and" Webster, have at‘

good shot at professional careers
in sports.

Following the presentation of
"the awards and Websters speech.
Gilliam and White had to hurry
off,/to watch the Cleveland —— San
Diego game on TV, as the Steelers
face the Browns on Sunday.

Icers Take On Indiana --

by BART MACK

Niththe 1972-73 season only one game old. the
Pitt Hockey Club will receive a thorough test when

1 they travel to the Belmont Arena in Kittanning, Pa..

to take on Indiana. The skaters downed Indiana
last spring for the league championship and to-
night’s contest will take on the atmosphere of a long
awaited rematch.

Pitt opened up the season with a 4-1 win over
St. Vincent College last weekend while Indiana will
be starting their season tonight. Pitt also defeated
Indiana early in last year’s campaign for the latters
only defeat in league play. A

Indiana boasted three of the top scorers in the
circuit last year in Pete Hanson, Ken Richert. and
Phil Bartchak. Hanson tallied 13 goals and 10 as-
sists while Richert also scored 13 goals with seven
assists. Bartchak lit the red lamp eight times and
received recognition for helping on nine others.

Although Pitt did finally regain the form they
displayed as an offensive powerhouse all last sea-
son, the team did~show some flaws against St. Vin-
cents. One particular drawback that Pitt has kept
from last year is the ability to take penalties.

The icers took four minor penalties against St.
Vincents which means that Pitt gave St. Vincents
the man advantage on four different occasions for
a total of 12 minutes. Pitt also lost the services of
Denny Browne for five minutes when he received a
major penalty for fighting.

Although Pitt gave up only one goal to St. Vin- ‘A

cents while down a man. they may not get away with
the same results against Indiana. The skaters
managed to control the play against St. Vincents
but will be facing a more powerful offense in In-
diana. ‘

Mark Lieberman, who came up with tremen- I
» dous saves on three breakaways in the St. Vincents

contest, will start at goal for Pitt. Lieberman also
came up with several good saves in last year’s
championship contest.‘

Defenseman Kerry Browne, who scored only

two goals all last season, has already equaled that
mark. scoring twice in‘ the season opener. Frank

Williams, the leading scorer for Pitt last year, tal- I

lied his first goal of the season last Saturday.
The “lush line” also made their presence on the ice
felt as Denny Browne scored the first Pitt goal of

the campaign with an assist from Phil Clarke.

There. have been a few surprises so far this
season in the Western Pennsylvania Intercollegi-
ate Hockey Association. Penn State (McKeesport).
the patsy of the league last year, came up with a
victory over St. Francis. Penn State did not win a
game in league competition last year.

St. Francis appears ready to take over Penn
State’s position in the cellar of the league. Du-
quesne clobbered St. Francis last Sunday by an
overwhelming 33-0 score. The Dukes are 2-1 so far,
losing to Carnegie-Mellon in the initial contest of
the WPIHA, while downing St. Vincent in their sec-
ond outing.

Penn State will meet St. Francis and Slippery
Rock will battle Carnegie-Mellon, this week while
Pitt will return to the Alpine on Sunday to face Penn
State.

Pitt will take an 11 game undefeated streak into
tonight‘s contest. The skaters have never been de-
feated by a team in the WPIHA. The contest will fea-
ture the two top offensive teams from last year.
Pitt tallied 79 goals in 10 games while Indiana, scor-
ed a total of 51 goals in nine games.

The two teams are also the best defensive
squads from last year. Pitt allowed only 18 goals
to slip into their nets and Indiana gave away just 25
markers.
