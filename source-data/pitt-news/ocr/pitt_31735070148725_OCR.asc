sports
need game
space

Gwenn Barney
- Senior Staﬁ" Writer

The Pitt men’s club soccer team
has a goal for this semester, and
Student Government Board mem-
bers said they will defend it.

The team wants to petition the
University for access to the Am-
brose Urbanic Field, located on
Pitt’s upper campus, for games.

But the Athletic Department
bans club sports from playing
on University ﬁelds, putting it
at odds with the Pitt men’s club
soccer team as well as other club
athletic teams.

Men’s club soccer plays in the
Tri—State Premier League, which
requires its members to host at
least one home game a season.
The issue for the club Panthers is
that their practice ﬁelds, the Cost
Sports Center ﬁelds, also on upper
campus, do not meet regulations
for competitive games.

This past spring semester,
club team president, sophomore
Ray Ludwig, met with officials in
Pitt’s Athletic Department and
requested the use of the ﬁeld for
one game to meet the League’s
requirement.

“We made a one—game request.
We requested a two-hour block
on a weekend,” Ludwig said. “It
didn’t matter which weekend. It
could be during the day, the night,

Pitt receives $125 million gift

Tegan Hanlon
Assistant News Editor

Pitt armouncedarecord-breakingdo—
nation onThursday, a$125 million gift
thatwill boost the University’s capital
campaign by about7percent. It’s Pitt’s
largest individual gift to date.

The gift comes from William S.
Dietrich II, a Pitt alumnus and for-
mer steel executive, who gave $265
million to Carnegie Mellon earlier
this month. I

Pitt said the gift will become op-
erational upon Dietrich’s death. Itwill
boost the University’s “Building Our
Future Together” capital campaign
past the $1.85 billion mark, edging
it closer to its $2 billion goal. The
campaign disperses funds for use in
scholarships and fellowships and by

faculty.

The gift is one of the 10 largest
made by an individual to a public
university in the U.S.

In response to the gift, Pitt’s Board
ofTrustees will introduce a resolution
to rename the University’s School of
Arts & Sciences the Kenneth P. Dietrich
School of Arts 8: Sciences in honor
of the donor’s.father. This follows
CMU’s decision to rename its College
of Humanities & Social Sciences after
Dietrich’s mother, which the univer-
sity made after the announcement of
Dietrich’s gift to the school.

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill said
that the renaming of the school was
not a stipulation of the gift, but the
University felt it an appropriate form
of recognition. ‘ *

Hill said that the money will sup-
port Pitt’s School of Arts 8: Sciences,"

but there is ﬂexibility as to the ways
the funds will be spent. He said he
expects that over time, there will be
additional scholarships and fellow-
ships available to students as a result
of the gift.

Dietrich, who has a long history
with the University, said in a press
release that he considered the gift an
investment. After earning his M.A.
and Ph.D. in political science at Pitt,
he went on to become part of Pitt’s
Board of Trustees in 1991 and served
as the Board’s chairman from 2061
to 2003.

“As a graduate who personally
beneﬁted from my own studies at Pitt,
I want to ensure that the University
can continue to provide educational
opportunities of the highest quality
to its undergraduate and graduate
citizens,” he said. I

Palestinian
U.N. bid

sparks
discussion

Amy Friedenberger
Assistant News Editor

There’s one thing that Israelis, Pal-
estinians and the supporters ofboth
sides can all agree on: They want
peace.

The Hilleljewish University Cen-
ter of Pittsburgh hosted “Talk Israel”
Thursday on the William Pitt Union
lawn in the wake of the Palestinian
bid for statehood at the United Na-
tions. The event aimed to foster dis-
cussion on the conflict between Israel
and the Palestinians,‘David Katz said.
Katz is the director of_]°Burgh, aHil—
lel initiative that serves the needs of

Jewish graduate students and young
professionals in Pittsburgh.

“There are a lot of questions that
students have,” Katz said, referring
to the issue between Israel and the
Palestinians atthe U.N. “This is really
a way for students to talk in an open
environment.”

The Palestinian Authority is ex-
pected to submit its bid to get the
U.N.’s statehood recognition at the
Security Council meeting today.
Palestinian Authority President
Mahmoud Abbas is scheduled to
address the U.N. General Assembly
and formally submit his letter of ap-
plication for statehood recognition
to U.N. Secretary—General Ban Ki-
moon, who will hand it over to Leba-
nonese ofﬁcials, which presides over
the Security Council this month.

The Trading Pitt simulates Wallstreet experience

Mahita Gajanan
For The Pitt News

One student group propelled
a Pitt senior to a job on Wall
Street.

This summer, Steve McMan-
nis found a summer job at SMD
Capital, a proprietary trading
firm in New York, where, as an
undergraduate, he developed a
training program for currency
trading.

He credits his success to
learning the tricks of the trade
outside the classroom.

“I came to Pitt knowing noth-
ing, and two and half years later
I worked on Wall Street because

4 of The Trading Pitt,” McMannis,

a senior economics major and
president of the club, said.

The Trading Pitt is one of 10
clubs in the country that focuses
on trading securities, including
equities, foreign currencies and
bonds. The club specializes in
educating interested members in
the fundamentals of ﬁnance.

Akash Goyal, ajunior econom-
ics major on the pre-medicine
track and the organization’s vice
president, said trading securities
is relevant to all fields.

“Markets affect everyone, as
was apparent in 2008 when the
entire country was hit in some
way by the stock market crash,”
he said.

The Trading Pitt, formed in
2008, had its first meeting of the
semester on Sept. 21 in Sennott
Square, in a packed room of more
than 30 students.

McMannis said that students
do not have to have trading ex-
perience to join the organization.
The group meets twice a week —
once for a how—to on stock mar-
ket trading for the beginners, and
a second time to discuss technical
strategies and practice trading.

The organization meets in
the ﬁnance labs in Mervis Hall,
where the members use comput-
ers to run simulations as a group
and trade for 20 to 30 minutes.

Club business manager An-
thony Mele said The Trading Pitt

is more like an intensive class '
than a student group.

“The club prepares you for
Wall Street and the banking in-
dustry,” the Pitt senior said.

Those who have a passion for
trading and investing use the
skills they learn in the simulated
setting of the group and apply it
to investments they make outside
of the club. .

“Some of these guys wake
up at 3 in the morning to trade,
because that is when the time is
ripe,” Devorah Dlinn, a junior
ﬁnance major, said. “My dad is
a portfolio manager. I grew up
with the market.”

Currency traders accommo-
date time differences between
different stock markets and
wake up at odd hours to make
the best of economic relations
worldwide.

Dlinn said that though the
technicalities of trading can
be intimidating for beginners,
tradingjargon becomes second
nature to the invested member,
and trading becomes a huge part
of one’s life.

Conversations including com-
pany abbreviations and reports
on the stock market’s ups and
downs can be commonly over-
heard at the biweekly meetings.

“Trading is not that compli-
cated,” Dlinn, a board member
of the club, said. “All you’re doing
is buying and selling shares of a
company. You have to judge what
is worth more or less. It’s like
buying a coat at Burberry because
it’s worth more than, say, a coat
at Tommy Hilfiger.”

According to Dlinn, good
traders are analytical and logi-
cal, trust their gut, have strong
market knowledge and know
when to cut losses. She said that
often people get too attached to
companies and lose out because
of failures to pull out their invest-
ments when they should.

Dlinn went on to say that fi-
nance is a broad subject where
strategies are up to the individu-
al. People can get creative and re-
ally enjoy trading because there
is no end to what people can do

in the field. g _
The members of the organi-
zation do not trade as a team.
Individual members create port-
folios, compete and trade for

I themselves.

At meetings, the members talk
about what is currently going on
in the markets.

This year, the club plans to
have speakers every other week.
Club organizers have invited
Mike Bellaﬁore, a co-founder of
SMB Capital, and Timothyjames,
a custom engineering manager
at Thomson Reuters. Co-found-
ers of The Trading Pitt, Robert
Spence and Cara Repasky, are
also returning to Pitt to speak
to the organization.

McMannis said learning how
to trade in college gives organiza-
tion members an advantage over
other students who only learn the
theories behind trading. He said
that trading is all about the expe-
rience, so the earlier one starts,
the more prepared one is.

Event generate

Israel 4 1

Pittsburgh’s Hillel, said that the tent
welcomed not justjewish students,
but Muslims and Christians as well.

“It’s a start for dialogue, which
is what we wanted to start with this
tent,” Kanne said. “It’s not an ‘I love
Israel’ tent.”

The event, which had about 15
students at a given time gathered
around the_ tent throughout the
day, included movie showings with
Israeli or Arab themes as well as dis-
cussions, in which students sat in a
circle and spoke. Lisa Santer, with
the National Coalition Building Insti-
tute, facilitated the discussion. The
National Coalition Building Institute
is a non-proﬁt, international organi-
zation that focuses on eliminating
racism, prejudice and discrimination
around the world. ,

A The theme of the discussion at 3

p.m. was how to achieve peace in a
broad sense, that could be applied
to the conﬂict between Israel and
Palestinians.

“What does peace mean to you?”
asked Santer to start the discus-
sion. ‘

]uniorAlexander Reichwald, who
joined the discussion upon passing
by the tent, said that he feels peace
is as much as an action as war is. He
said that he feels nations make more
of an effort to implement military
force.

“Peace is not having people be
scared on either side,” Leehee said.

The group discussed how to
achieve peace, because most felt that
countries often ﬁrst turn to money
and military force to try and establish
harmony. _.

The group agreed that the bes

s peace discussion

way to achieve peace would be
through educating people about
other countries to try and-combat
misconceptions.

One person asked whether the
group thought that the Palestinian
Authority was a viable partner for
peace.

“That’s a tough question,” said
senior Micah Toll, business manager
for Panthers for Israel.

Hillel President Mia Jacobs said
that one of the problems is that Israel
doesn’t have a partner for peace in
the Middle East. A

dressed the U.N..General Assembly

hood through the Security Council.

the morning. It was the simplest request
possible.”

The club president’s request was turned
down. Ludwig said that members of the
Athletic Department said University of-

. ﬁcials decided after ground was broken on

Ambrose Urbanic Field that only varsity
soccer members would be allowed access
to the ﬁeld. .

Ludwig said that this is because the ﬁeld
was funded privately, not through tuition
fees. John and Gertrude Petersen funded
much of the Petersen Sports Complex,
which contains the soccer ﬁeld. The Ath-
letic Department and University ofﬁcials

"did not respond to multiple requests for
comment.

“Of course varsity teams should have
ﬁrst dibs on ﬁelds,” Ludwig said. “But I
don’t think that should blockade club teams
from using it.” _

To remain in its league this semester,
men’s club soccer will rent Founders Field,
a 20-minute drive from campus, for one
day at a cost of $1,200.

“That’s a pretty big cost for us,” Ludwig
said. “Our dues went up $30 per player.”

After the springtime rejection, Ludwig
let the situation simmer for the summer
before bringing his concerns before SG
at a meeting Sept. 6. 0

SGB agreed to take up the ﬁght for
club ﬁeld time alongside Ludwig andqhis
team.

“This is not a promise that we can get
clubs on the ﬁeld,” SGB member Ryan Gay-
man said. “But this is starting a conver-
sation. There’s a problem with how our
system is "set up.”

Ludwig met with Gayman and SGB mem-
ber James Landreneau last Thursday to
assess the best way to move forward with
the team’s complaint. Ludwig and Gayman
said they want to gather as much support
as possible before meeting with adminis-
trators again. They are hoping that other
club teams experiencing similar difficulties
in ﬁnding an on—campus ﬁeld will join the
club soccer team as it begins a new round
of talks with the University.

The men’s team already has the women’s
club soccer team’s support. Without a home
ﬁeld, women’s club soccer plays all of its
games on the road, with the exception of
one tournament it hosts at Oakland Catho-
lic High School’s ﬁeld in North Oakland.

— Gayman said he would not release ﬁg-
ures for how much teams might save in
the event of a policy change without meet-
ing with all interested club team leaders
ﬁrst.

Ludwig said other club teams in Pitt’s
men’s club soccer league, including Carn-
egie Mellon’s team, are permitted to use
their school’s varsity team ﬁelds.

Soccer_isn’t the only club sport without
a playing ﬁeld. .

Pitt’s club. water polo team president
Harrison Fisher said that the team is not
permitted to host games in Trees Hall.

He said that the water polo league typi-
cally plays in tournaments, so the pool
would have to be reserved for several hours.
Because of the large number of aquatic or-
ganizations both affiliated and non—afﬁliat—
ed with Pitt, Fisher said there isn’t enough
time available to make reservations.

Fisher mentioned that club tournaments
normally include entrance fees paid  the
club team participants to the host team. If
tournaments were hosted at the University,
it would allow the club team to make money
for expenses.

Pitt’s club men’s and women’s volleyball
teams have been waiting sincejuly to hear
back about a request made to the Intramu-
ral Ofﬁce to use the Fitzgerald’Field House
for a men’s tournament in October and
women’s in November.

Paige Lloyd, women’s club volleyball
president, said that she fears it won’t have
time to get other teams to sign up for the
tournaments if it doesn’t hear back soon.
’ “Being a Pitt-afﬁliated organization,
we don’t get the recognition we deserve,”
she said.

sity matches to raise money for game and

Club soccer isn’t allowed to play on Pitt’s new soccer stadium, The Ambrose Urbanic

tournament travel expenses that exceed
SGB allocations. Next month, the team will
attend a tournament at Michigan State,
which will cost $2,000 out of pocket.

SGB allocations cover the team’s annual
trip to nationals, but participation in other
tournaments comes out of pocket.

“We’re fortunate to work all the women’s
varsity games,” team president Alex Hinsey
said. “It really helps out.”

Club ﬁeld hockey also doesn’t have any
home games on its schedules because of
lack of playing ﬁeld.

“It would deﬁnitely be really nice to
use the [Ambrose Urbanic Field], because
then we could actually have home games
or host a tournament,” Roxanne Dewalt,

Gayman acknowledged that the push
to get club teams onto varsity—designated
ﬁelds could be an arduous one. _

“This is deﬁnitely something that will

need to be chipped away at with a lot of .

hard work,” he said.

The men’s club soccer team is prepared
for the long haul, but its members know
student support is a necessity to achieve
their goal. A

“If it’s me against the University of Pitts-
burgh, that clearly won’t work,” Ludwig
said. “If other clubs are experiencing the
same problems, I urge them to make an
effort and encourage them to challenge,

The U.S. has been the middle man, trying
to organize peace negotiations between the
Israelis and the Palestinians. The four main
issues in the debate include the status of Pales-
tinian reﬁigees, the borders for Israel and the
Palestinians, security for Israel and, ﬁnally, the
matter ofjerusalem, which both sides claim as

their capital.

Although Obama made no mention ofveto-
ing the application during his speech, he did
vow prior to the U.N. congregation that the U.S.
would block the application. Should the U.S.
utilize its veto power, the Palestinians could
approach the General Assembly for a vote.
An approval could upgrade Palestinians to a
“nonmember observer state.” With that status,
Palestinians could participate in U.N. sessions
and work with‘the General Assembly. ‘ ~

OCC a superfluous program

Kenny Ong
For The Pitt News

Weallknowwhatthe Outsidethe Class-

whetherit’srea1lyworththe effort. And
we all joke that our OCC transcript is
only going to show employers how
many football games we*ve attended.
The University appears indifferent to
these reservations, however, since it
hasn’t ﬁilly addressed the issues un-
derlying them.

The OCC programbeganin20o8,
and since then it’s been marketed as so

easy to participate inand so beneﬁcial
to your resume that you’d be stupid to
ignore it. Alter all, marketing suggests,
your prospective employers won’t. An-

so far, no data has been provided to
substantiate the curriculum’s beneﬁts;
program coordinator Scott Hoffman
plans to release OCC graduate employ-
ment statistics by the end of the year.

Now, OCC’s requirements have
been streamlined, andanOCC Honor-

air. The overhaul does not address the
real problem with OCC, because the
problem is OCC itself— it’s a superflu-
ous, redundant label for the activities
we already do to build our resumés.
It’s a curriculum for extracurriciilars.
The program’s 10 goal areas -— lead-
ership development, career prepara-
tion, communication skills, global
and cultural awareness, sense of self,
service to others, Pitt pride, wellness,
appreciation of the arts and initiative
and drive — focus on concerns most
students already address during their
undergraduate tenure. Accomplish-
ments thatmakeyouanappealinghire
should be onyour regularresumé, and
any one-off activities, like attending a
conference or goingto afootball game,
probably don’t matter to employers.

Speakingofone—off activities: Even
though the University claims to have
removed most of the extraneous credit
opportunities, many of them are still
there. In fact, the “Pitt pride” goal area
is ﬁill of silly requirements. Not to say
attending bonﬁres isn’t enjoyable —
it’sjust notworth putting onaresumé.
As for the “sense of self” category, I
can maybe, possibly see an employer
appreciating a self—aware applicant,
although I am never going to pay to
use a service like Ancestry.com to get
OCC credit.

With regards to the honoraiysoci—
ety, however: Whoever came up with
this  you got me on this one. You just
had to go there, and I don’t blame you.
Nothing creates value out of nothing
like membership and privilege. I sup-
pose if I want a private date with em-
ployers and dignitaries, I’rn going to
have to participate inthe program— a
small price to pay to be part of a select
group. If most people participated in
OCC, however, that group would not

be so select. Butthat’s notthe case, and
those of us who don’t have our reasons
for notdoingso———reasons that include
not havingthe time fora20-hourlead-
ership seminar or the money to pay
for it (EmergingLeaders, for instance,
costs $60). It doesn’t seem fair to de-
prive students ofthesebeneﬁts because
they’re simply too busy.

Butforthose ofus whocanalford to
complete OCC,whynot do so? Forthis,
I don’t have a good answer: Although
I’m not sure ifcompletingthe program
isworth anything,Iamsureitwouldn’t
hurt. It rriightbe fundamentallyﬂawed,
butanextlaline oftext onyourresumé
is almost never detrimental. If the OCC
ends up getting you a job, that’s great.

Despite all its ﬂaws, I think the
University had good intentions when
it instated this curriculum. At the
same time, I want Pitt to be respon-
sible with our tuition money. I want
it to put forth an honest and enthu-
siastic effort to educate and prepare
every single one of us for the world.
And that’s where I have a problem
with the OCC. With the marketing,
the silly goal areas and the honorary
society, the program now appears to
be a thinly veiled effort to ensnare
more prospects and gain a little more
prestige.

I sincerely hope I’m wrong. I
want a job when I eventually get out
of school, and if OCC can do that for
me, I might forget the fact that it’s
seemed to be a redundancy for the
past three years. If the program has
not proven its employment beneﬁts
in the next two years, however, I want
the University to show its commit-
ment to the student body. Shelf the
OCC, and use its shortcomings as les-
sons learned to make a more eﬂicient
Career Development Office. I

FOREPLAY ON WORDS

Good sex needs time, practice

Leah Trimble
Columnist

We’ve all experienced it: the jack-
hammer, the darting-tongue kisser,
the two—pump rchump —— in short,
the partner that’s bad in bed.

Sometimes you can predict
what you’re up against. But every
once in a while, there’s that person
who oozes swagger, sexiness and
overall chemistry, yet can’t seem
totranslate the same effect to the
bedroom. A V

The resulting situation is not
only awkward but also difficult to
resolve. No one wants to be the
person lying there wishing that the
sex was over. (And obviously, no
one wants to be on the other end
either —_ so unskilled that your
partner is ﬁlled with glee thinking
about the end.)

But what do you do if you’re the
ﬁrst person‘? Do you exit the situa-
tion as tactfully as possible? Or do
you try and help insipid partners
improve their games?

Put simply, it depends on where
you want the relationship to go.

If the partner you’re with is
important to you, then your sex
life will be too, and it’s probably
not an option to get out right then
and there. Instead, try and work
out your problems. If you’re in a
hookup, however, it might be best
to end the night as soon as pos-
sible.

In this scenario, there are a few
ways to improve your partner’s
performance. The best technique
is try to subtly and sexily coax your
partner in the right direction. It’s
not acceptable to blurt out, “Can
you please stop kissing me‘? You’re
licking my whole face.” Instead,

say something like, “Baby, I love it

more when you kiss me like [insert

technique] .”

Ifthere’s a speciﬁc position that
works already, direct your partner
to it. If he or she is rr'iind—bloWing
at oral sex, start the night oif there
to get the mood going. Praise your
partner with enthusiastic noises
when it does feel good l— your
partner will respond. Everyone
loves a gold star. And don’t ever

i No onewants to

be the person lying‘
there wishing that  

the sex was over.

--——99————

be afraid to tell your partner what
is pleasing. Saying something like,
“Oh, that [your favorite thing] feels
so good,” will invariably send your
partner in the right direction.

In these situations, it’s impor-
tant to be patient: Good sex doesn’t
happen in a day, even if the talent
is there. Usually you’ll have to get
used to each other and learn the
things that will make intercourse
delightful for both of you. Im-
provement will follow after a few
sessions.

up, however, you should realize
something: If you want amazing
sex, or if you’re interested in im-
proving you and your partner’s per-
formance, this probably isn’t for
you. As a friend of mine remarked,
“If I’m just fooling around or hav-
ing a one-night stand, I really don’t
care about the girl getting what
she wants. I want to ﬁnish, and I
won’t work as hard to please her

.because I’llprobably never hook .

up with her again.” .'

In fact, if you’ll settle for noth-
ing less than amazing results, the
best policy is to bail before it goes

 too far. In other words, if you’re

kissing someone, and your gut is
warning you that it’s just going to

get worse once sex is initiated, you *

should get out quickly and pain-
lessly, rather than attempt to make
the plunge and coach your partner
into success.

I’m not saying to stop right in
the middle of a makeout session‘,

’ insult the poor person and contin-

ue to stomp out or send that person
home. There’s still time, though, to
ease your way out and just explain
that you don’t want to move any
further. A person shouldn’t expect
you to do anything more than kiss

if you’ve just met anyway.

Though it absolutely sucks to

have a damper on your sex life, it I

can almost always be ﬁxed. The
amount of work you put in just
depends on how much you care
about the other person involved
and where you want the relation-
ship to lead.

Stay patient, especially in
bed. You can’t expect greatness
on day one. But if you work on it,
I can promise that amazing sex is
coming your and your partner’s
ways. I

Ifyou’re just involved in a ho ok-

FOOTBALL

Pitt fa challege in Notre Dame

Pitt running back Ray Graham (N o. 1) will lead Pitt’s offensive attack a

R] Sepich
Staﬁ’ Writer

Some of the most memorable
moments in recent Pitt foot-
ball history came against Notre
Dame — from the 37-27 vic-
tory in the last game at Pitt Sta-
dium in 1999 to the Panthers’
quadruple-overtime victory
at Notre Dame in 2008 — and
Saturday’s game will be head
coach Todd Graham’s first
chance to make his mark on
the rivalry.

“I love the pageantry of col-
lege football, and I’ve got a lot
of respect for Notre Dame,”
Graham said. “I think games
like this are what it’s all about.
Our coaches want to coach in
these types of games, and our
players want to play in these
types of games.” —

Pitt wide receiver Devin
Street said that looking forward

to the game with Notre Dame
helped the team focus after its
blowing a 21-point lead in the
loss to Iowa on Saturday.

“With a loss to Iowa, it was
pretty tough,” Street said. “We
knew we couldn’t dwell on it
too much because of the game
with Notre Dame. You’re always
going to get your best game -for
Notre Dame. We have to play
60 minutes.”

Kickoff is set for noon at
Heinz Field between the two
teams thatboth experienced
mixed starts to their seasons.

The Panthers began the
season 2-0 and played well for
three quarters against Iowa un-
til blowing a 21-point lead” in
the final quarter. Street said
that after watching the film,
he could tell the Panthers had
made strides since their first
game of the season and that the
offense looked like it should
at times.

gainst Notre Dame at Heinz Field on
Saturday. Kickoff is set for noon.

“It’s high-powered,” he said.
“There were a lot ofgood plays
out there, and there could have
been more. I think we have to
hit on those the next couple of
weeks to be successful.”

Meanwhile, the Irish, na-
tionally ranked to begin the
season, narrowly dropped
their first two games —— against
South Florida and Michigan
— but rebounded with a 31-13
win last week over Michigan
State.

Despite Notre Dame’s 1-2
record, Graham said he be-
lieves that the Irish might be
the toughest team Pitt will play
all season.

“I’m very surprised by Notre
Dame’s record,” he said. “I
think they have to be in the
top oneor two teams on our

schedule, and the best team by »

Soccer teams discuss
Pitt’s moveto ACC

Greg Trietley &_]on Anzur
Staﬁ Writers

Both the men’s and women’s soc-
cer teams know that the move
to the Atlantic Coast _Confer—
ence will be an adjustment.
But while the women’s team consid-
ers the ACC a step up in competition,
men’s soccer defender Shane Flowers
said that the move is more a change
of pace than a direct improvement in
terms'ofcompet1'tion.

“I wouldn’t _say it’s an upgrade,”
Flowers said. “In the past few years,
the winners of the championship have
always been inthe ACC orthe Big East.
I’cl say it’s just a change of pace. It’s a
different atmosphere. We’re used to
our rivalries. Switching to a differ-
ent conference, We’re going to have
to rebuild all those rivahies.”

Men’s head coachjoe Luxbacher,
who has coached Pitt soccer in the
Big East since 1984, agreed that the
level of competition is similar across
the two conferences.

“I think the two strongest leagues
inthe country are the ACC and the Big
East,” he said. “The level of competi-
tion is not going to be any less, but
we have to see when it’s all going to
happen. All I know right now from
reading the paper is they’re saying
27-month wait, but I guess that could
change. We’re just waiting to hear.”

Although most of the media atten-
tion since Pitt announced its move to
the ACC has focused on how the con-
ference change will affect basketball
and football, almost all of the sports
on campus will make the switch as
well. This is ﬁrst in a series of reports
The Pitt News will do on the confer-
ence switch, so checkback next week
as The Pitt News gets the perspective
of all the University’s teams.

The Big East and ACC combine
for10 ofthe25 rankedteams inthis
week’s _NSCAA Coaches’ Poll, with
three ranked ACC teams and seven
ranked Big East squads.

Maryland of the ACC and Con-
necticut ofthe Big East rank No. 1
and No. 2, respectively.

AnACCteamwonthe NCAA Men’s
Soccer Championship ﬁve out of the

last 11 years —— Virginia winning most
recently, in 2009. Connecticut won
the last National Championship for
the Big East in 2000. _

Last year, ﬁve ACC teams and
seven Big East teams made up the
championship bracket.

Flowers said that the youngerplay-
ers — who will be with the prograny,
when the move occurs —— will enjoy
traveling to campuses that Pitt soccer
hasn’t been to in the past.

“We always play against the Big
East,” he said. “We’re lookingforward
to travelingto different cities and see-
ing different colleges.”

The Panthers last played an
ACC opponent in 2002, when they
droppeda game to Virginia, 2-0. They
have played just eight games against
ACC teams in their history.

“We just haven’t played many oﬁ,
the ACC teams, but I’ve seen them in
tournaments or the Final Four. I’ve
seen Maryland a couple of times,”
Luxbacher said. “It’s not that big of an
adjustment. I thinkthe style of play is
alittle different, but both conferences
play good soccer.”

Luxbacher said that the Big East
overall plays averyathletic, fast—paced
style and the ACC features more tech-
nical play.

Freshman Julian Dickenson said
the announcement of the move took»
the team by surprise.

“A lot of news always goes out
about people changing conferences,
and sometimes it happens and some-
times it doesn’t,” he said. “I thought if
it eventually happened I wouldn’t be ’
around to see i ” '

Dickenson and his teammates
were together when the news broke.

“Iwasinthetrainingroomwithmy
teammates, andlsawaﬂash on ESPN
that said that Pitt and Syracuse were
going to the ACC,” Dickenson said. “Is
was really surprised.”Dickenson, who
hails from Georgia, said he welcomes
the change. When the Panthers com-
plete the move to the ACC, the soccer
schedule will take the team through
his home state and close tohis high._
school friends.

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

South Florida continues to impress, tops rankings

R] Sepich
Staﬁ Writer

During a week of conference turmoil
‘_ that saw both Pitt and Syracuse bolt
Wforthe Atlantic Coast Conference, the

Big East still played some football.

While most media attention
focused on Pitt and Syracuse’s an-
nouncement, the conference’s foot-
ball teams played out a so-so 4-3
weekend.

Here are my standings heading
into the last weekend before Big East
play actually begins:

1. South Florida — The undefeated
Bulls enjoy their second week at the

‘. ‘top of my standings after a dominat-

ing 70-17 victory over Florida A&M.

South Florida is the only team in the

conference putting 60 minutes of
good football together consistently.

This week, Skip Holtz’s Bulls host
U'I'EP in what should be agood tune-

up for their key conference opener at
Pitt next Thursday.

2. West Virginia — The Mountain-
eers just can’t seem to put a whole
game together. WVU remains, along
with USF, one of two undefeated teams

__,in the conference, but it needed a late
stop against Maryland this weekend
to preventahuge collapse after storm-
ing out to a 34-10 lead. Quarterback
Geno Smith and his team will need to
play the perfect game this weekend if

they want beat No. 2 LSU.

3. Pittsburgh — Unlike WVU, Pitt
didn’t manage to avoid a collapse
this weekend, as the Panthers blew a
21-point lead at Iowa. Todd Graham’s
new system seemed to be ﬁnally click-
ing —— Pitt controlled the ﬁrst three
quarters. But it all went wrong from
there, and the Hawkeyes outscored
the Panthers 21-3 in the ﬁnal quarter.
Iowa badly exposed Pitt’s secondary
this weekend. With Notre Dame’s
spread offense coming to town,
quarterback Tino Sunseri and run-
ning back Ray Graham are going to
have to score some points to pull out
a win this weekend.

4. Syracuse — Despite losing
by three touchdowns at Southern
California this weekend, the Orange

keep their spot in the top half of V

the standings. Syracuse might not
be the most talented team, but the
Orange still play smart football, and
I expect them to rebound this week-
end against upset-minded Toledo at
home. Quarterback Ryan Nassib’s
game-management skills will keep
the team competitive in the Big East
all season.

5. Cincinnaﬁ — The same level of
mediocre play made ranking these
last four teams no easy task. For now,
the Bearcats hold down the ﬁfth-place
spot. Cincinnati’s two blowout wins
came against FCS Austin Peay and
lowly Akron, but scoring 49 points

in the ﬁrst half like the Bearcats did
this weekend is impressive against
anybody. This Thursday’s nationally
televised home game against North
Carolina State will say a lot about how
good this team is.

6. Rutgers — The Scarlet Knights_

were the only team in the conference
with a bye week, but overall, Rutgers’
play has surprised some people this
season. Big East teams in recentyears
have learned to never underesti-

at

Louisville rebounded this weekend
with a road win over its biggest rival,
Kentucky. Head coach Charlie Strong
leads a young team, which means the
Cardinals could be up and down all
season.

8. Connecticut — Last place seems
harsh for the Huskies, but they are
the only team in the conference with
a losing record. UConn could eas-

ily be undefeated as it blew fourth— .

quarter leads in consecutive

mate head coach Greg Schiano’s
Scarlet Knights and with a home
game against Ohio this week, Rutgers
should head into conference play next
weekend with a winning record.

7. Louisville - The award for the
most inconsistent team in the Big
Eastthis season goes to the Cardinals.
After struggling with Murray State
and losing to Florida International,

weeks against Vanderbilt and
Iowa State. With back-to-back games
against teams from the MAC coming
up, don’t expect the Huskies to stay at
the bottom for too long.

Offensive Player of the Week —
Geno Smith, Quarterback, West Vir-
ginia — Smith ﬁnished with career
highs in completions, attempts and
yardsashe registeredhissecond 300-

yard passing game of the season in
West Virginia’s win over Maryland.

Smith is spreading the ball around
well in new head coach Dana Hol-

gorsen’s passing system, as three of
his receivers ﬁnished with more than
100 yards this weekend.

DefensivePlayeroftheWeek—Der-
ek Wolfe, Defensive Tackle, Cincinnati
— Wolfe destroyed Akron’s offensive
line in the Bearcats’ blowout victory
this weekend. He recorded two sacks
and forced a fumble that Cincinnati
retumed for a touchdown.

Coach of the Week — Charlie
Strong, Louisville — After a tough
loss at home to Florida Internation-
al, Strong’s team circled the wagons

‘ this weekend and pulled off the upset
‘ against Kentucky. The Cardinals might

not be very good this season, but the
Louisville faithful will appreciate the

victory over the hated Wildcats.

What to watch for in Week Four
— Defending Home Turf: Six Big East
teams host home games this week-
end, but the two biggest games by
far are at Pitt and West Virginia. The
Panthers host Notre Dame, and the
Mountaineers face an even tougher
challenge when National Champion-
ship-contender LSU enters Morgan-
town. Wins in these two games could
go a long way toward getting the Big
East some respect in football — at
least while the Big East as we know it

is still around. ﬂ

Pitt’s defense better-prepared to face no—huddle offense

Notre Dame 4 7

this point.” Last year, Pitt fell
to Notre Dame 23-17 in South
Bend.

Turnover problems plagued
both teams early in the season,
especially in key situations.

Pitt has thrown four inter-
ceptions and lost two fumbles,

A and the Irish have tossed six in-
terceptions and lost four fum-
bles. One of the team’s goals for
the sé-ason is to win the turn-
over battle by three, as Graham
said he believes this is could
make a difference in whether
the game is won or lost.

“Our focus has been on two
things: owning the ball on of-
fense and getting takeaways on
defense,” Graham said.

M Co-defensive coordinator
Keith‘Patterson agreed.

“Th-_at’s something we’ve
definitely pointed out to the
kids,”;- Patterson said about

forcing turnovers. “We’ve told
them they need to step up and
make plays.”

The other key to Saturday’s
game could be how the Panthers
defend Notre Dame head coach
Brian Kelly’s passing system
and the Irish’s prolific senior
wide receiver Michael Floyd,
whom Graham called one of the
best receivers inthecountry.

Floyd has 31 catches this
season for 397 yards and two
touchdowns. He’s averaging
132.3 yards per game and 12.8
yards per catch.

Kelly, twice with Cincinnati
and once with Notre Dame last
season, has won his last three
games against Pitt with some
big passing plays. Although
Iowa made Pitt’s secondary
look vulnerable last weekend,
Graham feels cornerbacks
K’Waun Williams and Antwuan

Reed can respond this 'week-
end.

“We’ve got a lot of confi-
dence in our cornerbacks,”
he said. “They’ve got to elimi-
nate the errors. I think some
of that you have to look at and
say, ‘Maybe we can’t run all of
the things we’re running, and
we need to simplify and get
good.’ That’s what we’ve done
this week.”

One thing that could give
the Panthers defense the up-
per hand is that, this year, they
are used to working against the
high-tempo spread offense in
practice.

“That was our weakness
last year on defense —— I felt
we weren’t prepared for the no-
huddle,” defensive tackle Myles
Caragein said. “This year, go-
ing against our offense in prac-
tice has been a huge teaching

tool...I definitely feel We’re
ready for that.” '

Notre Dame is also a threat
defensively, especially the
front line.

“They really get after it. The
corners and safeties are really
athletic,” Street said. “They
just play complete football.
They are always flying to the
ball. We’re going to have to
protect the ball. But I also see
opportunity to get big plays
from them.”

Although this will be Todd
Graham’s first time facing Notre
Dame as Pitt’s head coach, he’s
experienced recent success
against the Irish.

Last season Graham’s Tulsa
team went to Notre Dame and
pulled offa huge upset after a
blocked extra point that was re-
turned for two points made the
difference in a 28-27 victory.

Kelly said he sees similarities
between Graham’s Tulsa team
and this year’s Pitt squad.
“From our standpoint,
it’s being more familiar with
Coach Graham’s philosophy as
to what he did at Tulsa, and
We’re really preparing for that
kind of offense — versus what
Pittsburgh ran last year, which

, under Coach Wannstedtwas a

totally different operation,”
he said.

Graham said he will find
out where the Panthers are as
a team after‘ the game against
the Irish.

“I believe they [Notre Dame]

’ are the best they have been,” .

Graham said. “We’re going to
be on our best game. Our guys
don’t need any [added] motiva-
tion, because they are excited
about the opportunity to play
against Notre Dame.” ﬂ

Ali Matisse (No. 15) and the Pitt women’s soccer team will face challenges in the highly

to ACC schools,” Dickenson said. “I talked to one
of my best friends about it. He goes to Clemson,
so I’m pretty excited to have him in the family.
A lot of friends from back home are going to
come watch me.”

On the women’s side, freshman forward Ali
Matisse said she’s excited to start competingwith
ACC teams and added that the move should help
the Panthers bring in more recruits.

“It’ll also bring more attention to our school
and our program,” she said. “So it’s time for us
to step it up and start playing the best soccer we
can play, because there’s a lot of great teams in
that conference.”

Seven ACC teams are currently ranked in the
NSCAA Coaches’ Poll, with Duke ranked high-
est of the seven at No. 4. Marquette is ranked
the highest of the three Big East squads in the
poll at No. 14.

While sophomore forward Katie Lippert is
eager to face the high—level teams in the ACC,
she said she’s also nervous about the upgrade
incompetition. A

“The ACC is agreat conference,” Lippert said.
“I’ve played against a lot of girls who play for ACC
schools. It’s deﬁnitely going to be a challenge.”

" Although the seniors on this year’s teams
probably won’t get the chanceto playinthe ACC
— as Pitt is not supposed to make the move for
27 months — senior midﬁelder Katie Ruhe said
she’s still excited for her teammates to have the
chance to play in the new conference.

“I think that us moving there will be a great
opportunity for Pitt’s program,” she said.

Although women’s soccer head coach Sue-
Moy Chin said that the Big East is a tough soc-
cer conference, she agreed with her team that
the competition in the ACC is greater. Although
the higher level of play will present a challenge,
Chin said that the style of play will be similar to

WOMEN'S SOCCER

Pitt players face personal

matchups this weekend

Jon Anzur
Staﬁ" Writer

Pitt women’s soccer players Ali Matisse and
Katie Ruhe want to win every game they play.
But this weekend’s matchups are personal.

On Friday night, the Panthers (2-6-2, 0-1-
1) host the Rutgers Scarlet Knights (6-3, 1-1).
The game not only gives Pitt an opportu-
nity to pick up its ﬁrst conference win of
the season, but it also presents Matisse with
the chance to compete against her former
high school teammate, Rutgers sophomore
forward Paige Alexander. The two played
together for three years at Mechanicsburg
Area Senior High School.

“I’m excited to see her more than any-
thing,” said Matisse, who scored her ﬁrst
career goal last Sunday in a2-2 tie with South
Florida. “We were really good friends in high
school. It will deﬁnitely make the game more
exciting.”

In 2009, both Matisse, then a junior in
high school, and Alexander, a senior, were
ﬁrst-team All-Mid—Penn Conference selec-
tions. Their team won 18 games —— a school
record until last year —— before eventually

losing in the second round of the Pennsyl-
vania State Playoffs.

The connection between Pitt and its op-
ponent will change from friendly to famil-
ial when the Panthers welcome Seton Hall
(6-1-2, 2-0) to Ambrose Urbanic Field on
Sunday.

Sophomore Amie Ruhe, Pitt senior Ka-
tie Ruhe’s younger sister, starts at midﬁeld
for the Pirates. The game marks the ﬁrst
time that the two sisters will take the ﬁeld
in different uniforms. The elder Ruhe said
that she expects a battle, and maybe some
trash talk.

"We'll see what happens,” she said. ’’I’m
going to tell the refs beforehand to let the
talking go. We don't mean everything we
say to each other.”

The verbal jabs exchanged between the
Ruhes might be playful, but the senior said
that her team’s need for a win is serious.

The Panthers are practically starving for a
win. They have not tasted victory since they
defeated Delaware 1-0 on Aug. 28. Since then,
Pitt has dropped four games. But Ruhe said

that Sunday’s two—goal tie put her team back
on the right track. ‘

“We’ve deﬁnitely been making progress,”
she said. “The past two games that we’ve
played have been the best games we’ve played
all season. So I’m expecting to keep moving
in the same direction.” .

Sophomore forward Katie Lippert said
that last week’s practices set the tone for the
Panthers’ resurgent offense last: Sunday.

“Everyone stepped up in practice last
week,” said Lippert, who scored the Pan-
thers’ second goal against South Florida. “I
think that followed through to this week. We
scrimrnaged a lot in order to prepare for the

game against Rutgers.”

Pitt will face one of the best offensive
threats in the country on Friday in-Rutgers
freshman forward Amy Pietrangelo. In addi-
tion to playing for team Canada at the Wom-
en’s World Cup this past year, Pietrangelo was
nominated for the Canadian U20 Player of the
Year award. She has a goal and two assists in
nine games this season.

“We deﬁnitely have to keep an eye on her,”
Pitt head coach Sue—Moy Chin said. “She’s a
real threat.”

Before practice on Tuesday, Chin said that
her team would focus on improving its own
play, rather than changing its scheme, in pre-
paring for the Scarlet Knights. Nonetheless,
Chin is making sure her players take note of
their opponents’ potentially potent offense.
Rutgers averages 1.33 goals per game this
season while surrendering only one.

“Their forwards move well up top,” she
said. “They do a lot of interchanging runs,
and they look for a lot of slip—passes in behind
the defense. So we’re going to work to make
sure that we don’t get pulled out of position
defensively. We want to guard against them
getting easy balls behind our defense.”

As far as results go, Chin said the Panthers
expect to add to their currently empty wins
column.

“We’re looking to get two wins this week-
end,” she said. “That’s our focus. It starts with
Rutgers on Friday.” I
