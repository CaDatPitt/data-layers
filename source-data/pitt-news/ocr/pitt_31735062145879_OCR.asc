Seventeen huulndred dollars worth
of valuables, including two saxo-
phonesfone banjo and a. suit case-
full ‘of watches with chains, were

-stolelp from .:fra.ternity houses at

Carnegie Tech last. week. Proﬁting
by the example, it is rumaored that
a ‘large number of Pitt fraternities
are taking, drastic measures to pre-
vent allikei occuirrence on this side
of the’ valley. _

One well-known group situated on
Dithridge street, are said to "have
passed a. rule requiring all members
to be in "the house promptly at ten
o’clock every evening so that all
doors can be locked. All keys ‘but

,one are to be thrown into the Alle-

gheny at the Seventh Street bridge.
and that one key ‘is never to leave
the hands of the head.-of the Pledge
Council. ‘‘‘This is necessary,” said
the president’ of the chapter, shak-

-ing his*- head sadly, “that we may
continue tO’_ hear the soulful. voices .

said to be even more severe in its

' ~ explosives, a power that can blast a mountain-
or crack a bouldcr——d1g an-isthmian canal or drain?

a swamp.

Today,cxplosivcs power isvcmployed both in the heaviest and"

e in the most delicate operations. The scientiﬁc. control of this?
rcsistless energy has enabled explosives cngincersto utilize-'.it i ‘ ‘
ways undrcamcd of 2. generation ago. i ' V
Recently at the Frazier Quarries of the Chesapeake 8: Ohio;

' Railroad in West Virginia, 6o,ooo pounds of du Pont dynamite
were exploded at one time to bring down ﬁve hundred million"
aund: ‘of stone: for ballast. Literally a whole hillside was

lasted out. -

I ‘ But in a power house in Baltimore, du Pont cxplosivcslwcjre
used to. yrform a different and delicate operation. I This iwo,tl:3.
involve‘ blasting Outﬁvc concrete bases in the basement of the“-
' building without damage to a switchboard that govcrnedthc;
distribution of power over a large section of the city." «While-
blasting was in pro rcss a glass of water and some wire nails’
placed on their hca s in an upright position near the blasts were b
not disturbed by the explosions. . C . . . I‘
So, in dynamite, we have a servant that will do our bidding in little things aswel li
as big—a power that can be made to perform our work easier, better and cheaper in

all industries.

The du Pont Coinpany has been making explosives since 18oz. V With thedcvelw
opment in explosives manufacture have come many improvements to expand the use ‘
o

the product.

And it has been the
search and experiment, to lead the way.

critical study of the career of some

vidual of the South Confederacy:

the ‘South in the middle oft’:-’the Nine-
teenth century. L '

Papers on the ﬁrst subject should

OF PUBLIC, OPINION?

Public opinion is a tool .and_ a
weapon that can make or ;_break al-

’ Public opinion, ' someone has-. said, is
public conscience. Does not that seem
true? '1 _ 0
o o no .. _
What is_ public opinion? If you ask
your psychology teacher’ he will an-
swer, “Public opinion is the decision
of a group upon an issue which has
been presented to it.” _ . ' ‘
, -Do the students of Pitifforrn agroup
to which an issue may beppresented
and in which a public opinion may be
formed? Our psychologists say that
such a group can form a public opin-
ion. _Now, do we have issues that ap-
pear before the students at Pitt?
Emphatically, yes! ‘ A

The man, today, who sits on the
steps of,Alumni Hali as-girls walk up
and down silently brands himself with:
a degrading purpose in sitting there.
Public opinion has begun to act.

The hundreds of men and women,
passing persons who sit on the ‘steps
in Alumni Hall, shyly watch them with
silent insinuations of their motives.
Public opinion excepts no one‘, Pub-
lic condemnation is the destruction of
reputation. 

Who can sit on the steps as pass-
ers insinuate the purpose of his sit-
ting there?

the steps as the girls walk up or
down, that perhaps there is a motive
for their sitting there? ,‘

Public opinion is public consci-

own conscience so every groupis the
product_ of its own public opinions. ‘

As aman lights a cigarette inthe

“I wonder ifheknows who put this»
building up and why it was built?”
The person who leisurely strolls up
and down thehalls with a lighted cig-
arette dangling stylishly from, his

him, “I don't give a darn for Pitt, or
her old traditions.” ‘

The one who deliberately stamps 
butt under his foot in Alumni Hall is
crushing his self respect by his-inso
lence toward the alumni who labored
and sacriﬁced to put that building up_
for his convenience. ,-

The ‘group jthat cannot meet an is
sue squarely and form a public opin-
in is a group that needs hide their
identity and apologize for their ex-
istence, ; 

If the public opinion which we in-
fer has not been created, the stu-

Hall must bow their heads in confes-
sion of low character. But no one
can believe that of Pitt!- ,

I16 * *

If ‘all the persons who could have
been found?“petting” in the far stair-
ways of Alumni Hall were to be count-'
ed, the total would be
small. But this small jgroupis ac-
tually giving to Pitt a, false reputa-
tion. ’ “ i
— We have heard many at Pitt say
that theyﬂhave no belief in ‘the state-
ment that t_here does exist, even to a
small degree, “petting” in Alumni
Hall. “When-.a casual visitor to the
University. however, does notice that
going on, some credence must be
given to the report. . ’
Are a few to impose a false reputa-

tion on the student body of Pitt?

Where is our public conscience? Will
it evolve and justify the conﬁdence in
Pitt’s high ideals? .
Our harshest critics are our friends.
That should be, for who takes such an
honest interest in our welfare. Pub-
lic opinion is the judgment of a ma-
jority of a groupabout all" of the
group. It may be harsh, but if so it
is rightly so. It is, indeed, a power-
ful weapon. ' ‘
