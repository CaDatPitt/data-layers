Craig Jackson elected SGB president by landslide

The Student Government
Board Elections Committee
has announced the results of
the elections for the 1988
SGB:

For President:

Craig Jackson: 1,382
Robert A. Reddy: 369

For Board:

Kent Baldauf: 1,126
Daryl Grecich: 1,003
Curt Toll: 853
Pamela Rich: 848
Jon Scanlon: 675
Nan Beal: 616

Kyle Durham: 538
Tanya Jackson: 524
Matt Pritt: 517
Robert Faizon: 454

Votes were tallied from the
William Pitt Union Ground
Floor, Towers Lobby, Bene-

1988 SGB election
winners announced

dum Hall Lobby, Lothrop Hall
Lobby, David Lawrence Hall
Lobby and Victoria Hall.

”The voter turnout wasn't as
good as last year,” according
to Tara Guseman, a member
of the Elections Committee.
Mike Damp, also a member of
the committee, said one pos-
sible reason might have been
the warm weather.

”It’s the biggest spread [in
votes for SGB president] I've
seen in the five years that I've
been here,” said Jeff Car-
penter, chairman of the Elec-
tions Committee. ”Everything
went smoothly. It was a very
good election. I look forward
to working with the candidates
in the upcoming year.”

Craig Jackson will be inau-
gurated the first Thursday of
the Winter term, as will the
eight candidates who received
the most votes.

’’I owe a lot of it to my folks,’’
Craig Jackson said right after he
was informed he would assume
the position of Student Govern-
ment Board president in January.

”They own a business back
home — cash register sales, soft-
ware, etc. —— my grandparents
started in '44. In the summer, my
folks would drop me off at the
office, and I'd sit there and work
for gram. They [my grandparents]
retired, and my folks took over
the business.”

This, he explained, was what
interested him enough in busi-
ness to major in it and political
science at Pitt.

”When we go home to talk, we
talk about business,” he said.

Perhaps his sense of business
will help him organize his new-
ly elected board. ”At six o'clock
[when elections were over], the
clock starts ticking, the ball starts
rolling, and it's time to start think-
ing about what we're going to
do,” said Jackson.

Some of the things he's already
discussing are taking student sur-

 

veys (in which pertinent ques-
tions would be asked of a
representative group of students),
get feedback on student housing,
spring break and the like.
Bring up the subject of com-
puters to Jackson — one of his

6‘  
Computers, com-
puters. I know that's all
I talk about 
_J .—‘Craig lackson
sticking points — and he's not

afraid to tell you what he thinks.
”Computers, computers. I

know that's all I talk about. But
we need more of them and more
space for them at Pitt. For in-
stance, Forbes Quad is the big-
gest waste of space I've seen in
my life,” said Jackson.

He said he became interested
in running for SGB president as
a result of his involvement in so
many other campus organiza-
tions, like the Pitt Program Coun-
cil, the Student Relations
Committee, and as a brother of
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.

Jackson, a 21-year-old-senior,
said that when he graduates, he'd
like to work a couple of years,
maybe for the government, and
then do some graduate work,
possibly with GSPIA here at Pitt,
and would-eventually like to earn
an M.B.A.

As far as his election to the
presidency, Jackson takes a very
modest position. ”The
newspaper articles will be some-
thing to send home to mom. The
SGB president — It's a nice title,
with a great deal of responsibili-
ty, but I hope people don't think
I'm going to change. My room-
mate promised me that's not go-
ing tohappen."

Students voice views

on SGB candidates
and overall elections

By Audrey Lamanna
For The Pitt News

For the past several days, Stu-
dent Government Board candi-
dates have stood long hours
outside the various voting areas
handing out flyers encouraging
students to vote for them.

Now that the results of the Stu-
dent Government Board elec-
tions have been announced, the
efforts of those who were elect-
ed have finally paid off.

Potential voters became
familiar with names like Baldauf,
Beal, Durham, Faizon, Grecich,
Jackson, Pritt, Rich, Scanlon, Red-
dy and Tall, by way of the signs

‘ that were hung everywhere~—

not excluding bathrooms and
windshields.

Many of the candidates per-
sonally visited dormitories to chat
with the residents. One student
said, ”He [Craig Jackson, presi-
dent elect] came up to the dorm
and told us his platform. He real-
ly made an effort to let his issues
be known.”

Though both candidates had
related experience, the frontrun-
ner in the campaign between
Robert Reddy and Craig Jackson
for president appeared to be
Jackson. '

The voting booths were abuzz
with chatter. Joy Nagel, a sopho-
more, said she voted for Jackson
”because- I've seen how involved
he is on campus, and I'm im-
pressed by his actions.”

The same type of sentiment
was expressed by many ballot-
casters. Questioned about their
choice, statements like ’’I believe
in what he stands for; he's a presi-
dent for the students” were
typical.

”I read the comparison [of can-
didates] in The Pitt News and
agreed with what he [Jackson]
stood for,” said Jack Martin, a
junior. Alisa Schulman, fresh-
man, said ”He [Jackson] had a lot
of good views on policies that in-
terested me.”

”From what I've heard  he's
very personable,” said Alyssa
Schmitt, a sophomore. And fresh-
man Angela Kopchak was
swayed by perhaps a greater as-
set ofJackson: she voted for him
”because he's sexy.”

But what_ brought out the
voters?

Curry Franklin, freshman, said
”Students should take part in the
voting process because we must
have a say in who runs our stu-
dent government.”

Deaver’s pr

 

WASHINGTON — The prose-
cution in former presidential aide
Michael K. Deaver’s perjury trial
sought Wednesday to counteract
defense suggestions that Deaver

- was unprepared for the detailed

questioning about his lobbying
business by a House subcom-
mittee.

Pamela G. Bailey, a former em-

A ployee at Michael K. Deaver &

Associates, was asked by in-
dependent counsel Whitney
North Seymour Jr. to clarify earli-
er answers she had given about

'the amount of preparation

Deaver had for testifying before
a House subcommittee inves-
tigating his lobbying.

The defense, trying to show
Deaver was unprepared for the
range of questions he was asked
during his congressional testimo-
ny, had elicited answers in cross-
examination on Tuesday that
Deaver concentrated on ques-
tions about his representation of
Canada on the issue of acid rain.

But on redirect-examination by
Seymour, Bailey reiterated a
previous statement that Deaver

and his lawyers were notified by

the subcommittee that the inquiry
had been broadened, ”something
to the effect, expect everything.”
Bailey testified that the firm’s
staff had reviewed a number of
allegations about Deaver that had
appeared in a barrage of news
stories on her former boss.

Transplant girl getting
better at area hospital

PITTSBURGH -— A Kentucky
toddler who received five new
organs in experimental transplant
surgery was taken off a respirator
Wednesday, a sign of her steady
improvement, hospital officials
said.

Doctors removed the respirator
late Wednesday morning, ena-
bling Tabatha Foster to breathe
on her own and talk for the first
time since the 15-hour operation
began Saturday, said Lynn
McMahon, a spokeswoman for
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.

Her condition was upgraded
from critical to critical but stable,
McMahon said.

The 3-year-old Madisonville,
Ky., girl received a new liver,
pancreas, small intestine and
parts of a stomach and colon. She
is only the third person in the
country to undergo the proce-
dure. The other two patients died.

Tabatha was born with short
gut syndrome, a fatal, congenital
condition, and later developed
liver failure. She needed only a
new liver and small intestine to
survive, but doctors said it was
less complicated to transplant the
five-organ group.

Citiparks learn—to-skate sessions
will begin Nov. 10 at Schenley
Park Ice Skating Rink.

Those enrolled in the sessions
will be taught fundamental skat-
ing skills, such as proper locomo-
tion, forward cross—overs and
backward movement, according
to Bill Backa, public relations
coordinator for Citiparks.

Lessons will be taught on four

consecutive Tuesdays: Nov. 10, .

17, 24 and Dec. 1. An addition-
al Iearn-to—skate program will run
on four consecutive Fridays: Nov.
13, 20, 27 and Dec. 4.

The classes will be held,
weather permitting, from 4 p.m.
to 6:30 p.m. Each session will
consist of one hour of instruction
followed by supervised practice
time.

The cost of the program is $10.
Skate rental per session is $1, and
skate sharpening is available for
$2. , '

The program marks the open-
ing of the Schenley Park Ice Skat-
ing Rink scheduled for Tuesday,
Nov. 10.

According to Backa, the rink
has a few new aspects this year,
such as new skates purchased last
December.

”Also, new lighting and a new
sound system have been installed
to make it nicer,” Backa said.

On Tuesday nights, students
with a college ID will receive 50
cents off the price of admission.
Regular admission is $1.50 for
adults aged 19 and older.

”We’re excited about all the
Pitt students who come down to
skate,” Backa said.

Registration for lessons is man-
datory since class size is limited
to 60 skaters. To register, or for

Babies can now go joggi 

By Nicholas K. Geranios

Associated Press Writer

YAKIMA, Wash. — In the
booming business of equipping
the Baby Boomers, a company
that makes baby strollers for jog-
gers is a runaway success.

The children of Prince Charles
and Princess Di, Billy Joel and
Christie Brinkley, and Sports Illus-
trated swimsuit covergirl Kim
Alexis all have one of Phil Baech-
|er’s Baby Jogger strollers.

Baechler, a 39-year-old former
newspaperman, invented the
lightweight, three-wheeled
stroller five years ago because the
avid runner hated to leave his son
Travis at home during workouts.

The solution was to take him
along in the aluminum—framed
cart fitted with nylon seats and
20-inch bicycle wheels.

”Our customers are affluent,
the prototype yuppies,” said
Mary Baechler, 31, the inventor’s
wife and president of Racing
Strollers Inc. I

The strollers allow customers to
combine the yuppieipassions for
fitness and family, she said.

”You have couples that ran be-

and that put a damper on exer-

Most sales are by word-of-

regularly getfree publicity when
they are used as props in athletic

To those of you who
voted, we salute you

The election of a new Student Government Board and presi-
dent each year at the University of Pittsburgh is an event in

‘ which every student should participate. However, as in the case

of all student activities, a large discrepancy exists between the
number of students who participate and those who are eligi-
ble to do so.

And that is fine.

Students who voted in this year's election are to be commend-
ed. Apathy has always been a heavily stressed issue at most
college campuses. It seems as if things are turning around. No
longer are our Student Government Board candidates pinpoint-
ing apathy as a cause for problems, but instead, are actively
suggesting solutions to more specific problems.

We will never have anything to fear, as long as there are those
students who are willing to participate, whether it be those who
vote or those who are voted for. And there always will be stu-
dents who will participate.

Current SGB should
proceed with caution

Now that a new Student Government Board has been elect-
ed, it will be all to easy for the current one to shirk responsibil-
ities and fail to complete projects.

They have done a good job so far —— it is our hope that the
quality of their work will continue through the remainder of
the term, and that they will do their best to tie up loose ends
before the new Board takes office.

Sex? You gotta be kidding ...

Last week, The Pitt News
received a letter addressed to one
of our writers ——— the content of
which is unimportant, except for
a flip post script remark, which
had nothing to do with anything
stated in the letter.

It read: ”P.S. Please take Dr.
Ruth out of our school
newspaper.

I hadn't even really thought
about Dr. Ruth much, until. we
received that letter. In fact, I oc-
casionally type Dr. Ruth into the
VDTs, but because I'm typing un-
consciously, I don't realize the
subject matter of some of her
material.

So, I decided to take a look for
myself just to see if I could figure
out why the woman who wrote
this letter wouldn't want Dr. Ruth
in the paper.

Well, needless to say, I was
shocked. When I scanned the
paper, words like virgin, penis,
ejaculation, and yes, even the
dreaded masturbation appeared
in the text.

I was enticed to read further.
Unmentionables were men-
tioned, unspeakables were
spoken, and what some might
consider social faux pas, were
faux pawed.

I was aghast. Immediately, the
names of local and national
moral task forces danced around
in my head. (Thank God they
weren't dirty dancing.)

Being that the student who
wrote the letter is a graduate stu-
dent, I thought, her reason for
wanting Ms. Westheimer plucked
off the pages of The Pitt News
could be an intellectual one.
Maybe Dr. Ruth wasn't specific
enough. Maybe she was anatom-
ically incorrect about a few
things. Maybe, just maybe, she
was a McSex therapist.

Because I was so appalled at
the material, I continued to read.
Here's one passage that particu-
larly offended me:

Q: We have been going around
together for two months. Some-
times he comes to my place,
sometimes I visit his. We have
known each other for 72 years,
and for many of those, we were
married to other people. Now we
are both single. He has asked me
to go on a weekend trip with

    

FRANCES
SANSIG

him. Would this be wise?

A: Why not? You like each
other, you are both free. This
weekend might be the beginning
of a wonderful new level of
friendship. Take him up on it.

After careful scrutiny, I sur-
mised that Harold Robbins,
Danielle Steel and Xaviera Hol-
lander were mere cream puffs
compared to this gonad guru. If
a really informed person were to
answer the question, it might
have gone something like this:

A: Yes, a romantic fling to a far-
off land for a wild, kinky solution
to your perpetual horniness
sounds in order here. You both
sound like desperate, sex starved
maniacs to me. You're single,
you don't have any diseases, you
sound like you know about birth
control, and maybe he’ll be good
for a few more pokes after this.
Call me and tell me how it goes.

Much cleaner stuff.

Nevermind that these ques-
tions to Dr. Ruth are actual ques-
tions from actual people who

have these actual problems. Such

things as vulvas do not exist in ,

this society, as any good Christi-
an knows.

Anyway, maybe this graduate
student doesn't want it I n our stu-
dent newspaper because it al-
ready runs in another paper she
subscribes to, and if we didn't use
Ruth, we could print some other
sex columnist, so she could be
twice as informed.

I don't know about you, but I
say something should be done.
Dr. Ruth is just another loony rad-
ical who's skyrocketed to fame by
extolling the virtues of taboo sub-
jects. Celibates unite! There is no
place for sex in a society of men
and women! Liquidate your

The more Dr. Ruth I read, the
angrier it makes me. I mean, hey,
who's idea was this anyway?

Let's look at some more, huh:

Q: Since my boyfriend and I
brokeup, I haven’t been able to
fantasize or pleasure myself. It
has been over a year now. Is it
normal to be so upset that one
can't even daydream about sex
for so long?

A: just give yourselfa relaxing
hour or even 75 minutes every
day, taking a bubble bath, listen-
ing to soothing music, thinking
about scenes you like or sounds
you like to hear 

Totally disgusting.

So, when I type Dr. Ruth for
Monday's issue, you'll be glad to
know I read it, I was appalled,
and I can't wait to read the next
column she writes. I might even
read it twice.

Here's to good sex.

In the interest
of a safer street

One responsibility as a future civil engineer is to insure the
safety of pedestrians and motorists during construction. The
replacement of the David Lawrence auditorium roof this week
is a potential accident waiting to happen.‘

There is a crane parked on the sidewalk and a garbage bin
on the roadway. Whether the roof needs [to be] repaired is not
the issue here, but how the current traffic pattern is set up. There
are no advance warning signs posted nor are there any smooth
transition cones for motorists to switch lanes. Along with this,
sidewalk pedestrians are forced to cross Forbes Avenue just to __

I know by working as an engineering intern for PennDOT
for the past two summers [that] this wouldbe totally unaccept-
able, and [they should] have someone severely reprimanded.
Why couldn't the university, or city, or even the contractor use
some common sense to arrange a safer traffic pattern while get-

And baby, we mean fame, man.
Turn your 15 minutes into a lifetime today!

Cruising the countryside the
other day, I found myself punch-
ing the buttons of my car radio in
search of something new and in-
teresting to listen to. What I found
certainly was interesting. But pop
music was up to its tricks again.

It seems a local radio station
had begun a block of "new hits,”
which actually contained a num-
ber of old hits, disguised as with
a rubber nose and glasses by the
casual and synthetic touch of the
'80s. Some nerve.

Billy Idol, haveyou no shame?
"Mony, Mony," that great, old
Tommy James standard, spewed
forth from my speakers filled with
all the bile and lack of heart that
half-baked, psuedo punker could
muster. And who is this Tiffany?
Where does she get off nabbing
"I Think We're Alone Now,”
again from the Tommy James
songbook, for her debut single?

I realize that remakes of old
songs remake money for the
original songwriters. And I'd be
the last person on earth to deny
Tommy James the few extra
bucks he deserves. But why can't
the record industry keep its hands
off the golden oldies and its mind
offthe good old days? What does
this tell us about the here and
now?

This sort of thing really irks me.
New versions of classic oldies are
seldom (if ever) as good as the
originals. We've already heard

Cyndi Lauper, whose work I"

usually love, tear the heart and

  

soul out of Marvin Gaye's
"What's Going On." The last
’thing I wanted to see happen to
a great song like Simon and
Garfunkel’s ."A Hazy Side of
Winter” was for it to be remem-
bered by the next wave of kids as
that "sort of strange song the Ban-

gles did for that movie Less Than’ '

Zero.” Fer sure. The Bang|:es,l.so
deep you ‘could probe the bottom

of their talent with a toothpick, I

have done the unspeakable and
have rendered the unlistenable
for the unviewable. If it were only
unmarketable, we'd be in busi-
ness (or out of it, I should say).

True, much of pop’s new
material is so l-ame that it isn't
even worth speaking about let
alone listening to. But must this
meant "open season" on the
oldies catalogues?

If it worked then, .it._should

A lesson from a lunatic 

Something bizzare happened
to me yesterday, and I'm still not
sure how to react to it.

I was in my fiction writing class
and, as usual, we were discuss-
ing and critiquing a story written
by one of my classmates. As I
raised a couple fingers to make a
comment, an ‘elderly woman
wearing a long brown dress
walked to the fron-t of the
classroom.

I didn't notice her at first until
the professor suddenly turned
around in his chair to face her.

"Get all these children out of
here!” she said to the professor
and slammed her hand down on
the podium, "I want to talk to you
alone!”

The professor blinked a few
times before he calmy told her to
meet him after class.

"No, no, no!” she screamed
louden ’

The professor just stared at her
with his mouth gaping open.

"Look at what you're teaching
these children!” the woman
shouted, waving copies of stu-
dents’ stories in my professor's
face. "It’s disgusting!”

She tore up the stories and
threw the pieces at him.

I felt glued to my chair, trying
to grasp what was going on. For
a moment I was certain this wom-
an would take out a .357 Mag-

  

work now, right? The record in-
dustry has been showing symp-
toms of the bet-on—a—sure-thing
syndrome. So why not remake
Staff Sergeant Barry Sadler’s I966
classic,_"The‘ Ballad of the Green
Berets"? I'll bet if Ollie North was

num and blow the professor's
head off.

The professor remained silent
and watched the pieces of paper
falling to the floor.

After the last page was ripped,
the woman stormed out of the

classroom, slamming the door ii

behind her.

Most of the class looked at
each other not knowing how to
respond.

The professor turned to us and
laughed. "Will someone please
tell me what the hell was that all
about?”

The class laughed loudly with
him and soon became quiet
again. . _

"I don't know what to say," the

. -X

record would hit the top of the
charts and stay there for weeks
(not that I want togive him or any
producers any bright ideas).
I'm afraid that what's happen-
ing to the recording industry is
the same thing we've seen hap-

pen to television. It's been getting ‘

less experimental, more profit-
motivated and, hence, has begun

.to lean on more sure-fire

schemes.

Since we're just about to the
point in history wherethe kids of
the kids who enjoyed the music
of the '69s for the first time
around are old enough to start
buying records for themselves, I'd
be willing to bet we'll see many
more remakes in the not-too-
distant future. Can you imagine
it? Bon Jovi attacking "Hey
Jude"? How many more Ritchie

' Valens tunes can Los.Lobos do?

professor continued. ''I_ kind of

feel sorry for her. "Did anyone i

know who she was?" I
Nobody did.
He slowly bent down to pick

up the pieces of paper around his ’

chair, and within a few minutes
we returned to discussing our
stories.

The entire experience seemed
to be cut from a movie, and I felt
like an extra on the set. It couldn't

be more ironic that this woman I
picked a fiction professor to stage V

her scene.

It bothered me that the class
seemed to dismiss the incident as
a crazy woman who wandered
into class one day. l

Though this was partially true,
something else happened. Dur-
ing the time the woman was rant-
ing on, and soon after she left, I
noticed a change in my professor..

No longer was he an authority ‘

with the power to pass or fail me.
He seemed more like a confused
and even scared human being.

Though my professor joked"
about the woman, I sensed he
was hurt. If I were him, I would
feel the same way.

In fact, I wouldn't be surprised

if my professor writes about this
woman, too.

Stocks fall again as

NEW YORK — Stocks stum-
bled on Wall Street Wednesday
after overseas sell—offs caused by
the falling dollar and the view
that the United States isn't acting
aggressively enough to correct its
huge deficits.

The Dow Jones average of 30
blue-chip stocks lost more than
35 points this morning, recovered
most of it by early afternoon, then
fell again, closing down 18.24 at
1,945.29. Broader market indices
were lower and losing stocks out-
numbered gainers by about a

rates fell. The treasury’s key

_ t’s a new tale for the ex-Bauhaus members: a1 different sound tat’s not as dark as ”The Light.”

Love & Rockets explodes with a brighter sound

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

You wouldn't expect pi-
oneers of ”death” rock to
be‘ popular in the discos,
but Love and Rockets broke
new ground when their re-
make of the Temptations’
”Ball of Confusion" lit up
the dancefloors last year.

Originally three-fourths of

Bauhaus, Daniel Ash, David _

J. and Kevin Haskins were
known for their morbid
sound and somber outlook.
But all that has changed.
Love and Rockets brings
their rousing mix of '60s
psychedelia with '80s pop
to Fischer Auditorium at In-

diana University of Pennsyl-
vania Monday night.

With their latest single, ‘
”No New Tale To Tell"
bursting through college ra-
dio charts, the band seems
to have shaken off their
black image.

‘After the breakup of Bau-
haus two years ago, Love
and Rockets formed and
released Seventh Dream of

.a Teenage Heaven on Big

Time/ RCA Records.

The band found their
identity in Express, which
they released later in 1986.
It hit the top of the college
charts, and ”Ball of Confu-
sion” went gold in Canada.

Critics called Express un-
pretentious and praised
Love and Rockets. for their
ability to tone down Bau-
haus’ darker elements.

Their latest LP,
Earth.Sun.Moon, features a
diverse mix of songs to
back up ”No New Tale To
Tell.”

”Mirror People” offers
thrashing guitars and pound-
ing drums; ”Rainbird” is a
haunting (yet folksy)
reminder of their darker
past; and ”Welcome Tomor-
row”s’ pop sensibility
rounds out the album.

But the band still feels

”The Light,” they recall
their touching days as a
death rock band:

Do you remember the
blackest moments? The
blackest thoughts, the rush?

Love and Rockets remains
far removed from Bauhaus.
The band wanted to move
in a more prevalent direc-
tion while still clinging to
the mystery of their past.

Their conflicting musical
styles are unique, and

a maybe that's what makes

them so popular on alterna-
tive radio.

Bassist David J. has a
smooth voice that's perfect
for post-punk pop, and the

band's dark undertones give
them credibility with angst
diehards. '

”No New Tale To Tell" is

sure to bring Love and
Rockets the audience

they've been looking for

outside of England. its
acoustic guitar and flute in- .
troduction sets a serious
tone borrowed from
Bauhaus.

But the sound is softened“
just enough to make more
impact when the drums and
feedback kick in. ’

Love and Rockets will be
one of radio's most power-‘
ful and affecting bands once
they come to grips with
their sound and their past.

Pere Ubu brings the

By Joel Timulak
Staff Writer

Pere Ubu, the avant-garde garage band
that critics claim to be the most influen-
tial American band of the past 15 years,
is back. The Cleveland-based Ubu has
reformed and was in Pittsburgh last Thurs-
day on part of a tour that will get their
new songs in shape. They plan on record-
ing a new record later this month.

Pere Ubu formed in 1975 as an ex-
perimental group to try producing some
interesting songs. The band, featuring
David Thomas on vocals and the late
Peter Laughner on guitars, played in
Cleveland clubs for about a year. Steady
playing resulted in the classic punk-cover
”Final Solution.” In May of 1976, Ubu
broke up but reformed in July with

Krause and Thomas, from the earlier edi-

tion, adding keyboardist/saxophonist Al-

The new Pere Ubu recorded singles
which are now classics using redone ver-
sions of songs which Peter Laughner

helped write. These singles were released.

again on the 1978 EP Datapanik in the
Year Zero and re—released in 1985 on Ter-
minal Tower. The band is also credited
with three groundbreaking LPs — The
Modern Dance, Dub Housing and New
Picnic Time.

The records featured consistently in- .

teresting music, but the most outstanding
components of the Ubu sound were Al-

’ len Ravenstine’s tapes of idustrial noise ‘

and conversations and David Thomas’-

whimsical, sometimes macabre, lyrics .

and high-pitched often-unintelligible cry.
After eight tours,“ including three in Eu-

rope, the "band split up. L J _  _,

 

With different members the band
recorded two more records and broke up

again, this time, seemingly, for good. Af- ,

ter about five years of solo records, an ar-
chival Ubu record and collection of older
Ubu live recordings, Pere Ubu is back,
comprised mostly of members from the
earlier edition. Thomas, Ravenstine,
Krauss and Maimone are joined by Chris
Carter, a second drummer, and Jim Jones,
a member of a later edition of Pere Ubu.

Before last week's Graffiti show, Tho-
mas explained that Pere Ubu never real-
ly broke up. After their last tour in 1982,
they were tired and personnel difficulties
arose. The musicians constantly wrote
more songs and played in different
groups, sometimes with other members.

Recently, they started exchanging tapes
and eventually met to work together.

"We came up with about 11 new songs,

call [yourselves] Pere Ubu again?’ ” said _ 

Thomas.

Now the band is on a two-week, E'ast-  _
Coast tour to ”let the new songs mature, 1
take shape  to get them to the point 

where they live,” said Thomas. The new
songs he likened to ”fine stones on a
necklace.” He continued, "You don't
want to put them on a cheap string, you
want to put them on a gold ‘chain with
fancy things in between them.” The work-

ing title for the LP which will be released. ‘

in March, is The Tenement Year.

So far, he said of the new songs,_ "We
go onstage, people scream, and. they
don't stop till we leave.'' .

Pere Ubu, he said, has no certain mean-
ing that he felt the need to explore again.
|nstead,. hecalled the band a "process for

interesting music, a different approach to J

Freeto be You and Me starts its own family

 

LOS ANGELES (AP) ‘— Actress
-Marlo Thomas and her friends
have a new book and album
coming out about the family.

Free to Be  a Family won't
talk about the storybook idea of

A a family. ”We’re saying to chil-

dren of our country, ‘Whatever
your family is is a family,’ ” said

V Thomas.

It follows her 1984 best-selling
book, album and television spe-
cial ”Free to Be You and Me,”
which challenged racial, sexist
and economic stereotypes of

’ children.

The family book will be out this
month, with a 350,000 advance
hardcover printing from Bantam.
Contributors to the book include
Gloria Steinem, Letty Cottin
Pogrebin, Chris Cerf, Judith Viorst
and Shel Silverstein.

Thomas was in a recording stu-
dio with Lily Tomlin, Mel Brooks,
Bea Arthur, Robin Williams,
Whoopi Goldberg and Mike
Nichols for the album, to be
released next spring by A&M.

As with the first effort, which
brought in more than $2 million,

The ballet sold 42 seats before
the event was announced, Ansin
said. ”We called a few key peo-
ple, and they said yes immediate-
ly,” he said.

It has fallen to Caroline, daugh-
ter of the late Princess Grace, to
act as royal hostess and patron of
the arts since Prince Rainier,
Monaco’s reigning monarch, is
still single.

Proceeds from Caroline’s visit
will be divided among the Mia-

Continued from page 9
continued is certainly not a for-
mula, it is a ”social, communal
intercourse  the result of the in-
teraction of the different musi-
cians.” He compared the band to
a sort of Chinese puzzle that con-
sists of several oddly shaped
pieces that fit together as a
sphere. ”Pere Ubu operates only
as a unit; one person does not
conceptualize or determine the
band's meaning.”

The band uses ”sound for its
evocative, enhancing nature —
one sound for a thousand words
—- not merely and industrial noise
which is sound as a blunt instru-
ment used to disarm.” The new
songs are definitely rock, he said,
”surprising and nimble, and with
two drummers, immensely
powerful.” The live shows are a
”restrained and disciplined use of
sound instead of massive noise
and disturbance.”

Appropriately, the name of the
band came from the avant-garde
play by Alfred Jarry, Ubu Roi. The
1896 play featured Pere Ubu, a
base and stupid man who, at his
wife's influence, kills the king of

. an imaginary Poland and steals

the crown. " _ v

Thomas cited three reasons for
choosing the name. The first rea-
son is the intense, innovative
method of Jarry’s production
which neccesitates the use of im-
agination; the second reason is
that it sounds good, and lastly, it
has no meaning. The first reason
is the ”avant" ‘concept the band
holds, and the last two are the
”garage” attitude they hold.

Further defining the band, Tho-
mas said that Pere Ubu is ”a great
live band, the greatest rock
band.” Their following was large-
ly musicians, and they were al-
ways happy with that. ”There are
always people who don't fit.
They may be Stockbrokers, jani-
tors, punks, students, but ’baby,
baby, baby’ doesn't work for
them. We don't care who comes
to see us; we just want an in-
teresting audience.”

Thomas also added that the
long awaited Volume II live al-
bum will be released in the com-
ing months. It will be called_One
Man Drives, Other Man Screams.

After the release of The Tene-
ment Year, the/reunited legen-
dary band will set out on their

iHypinotichorizontal  non-viewer's guide to TV

 

By Frances Sansig
Contributing Editor

Because I spend very little time
watching television, it is difficult

for me to decide what to watch
when I watch, especially because
I don't know what's on. Cable
guides are useless dribble.

The only way to really watch
TV these days, with the number
of channels available, is the trial-
and-error method.

So, for those of you who don't
know what's going on in vegeta-
ble land, like myself, I have de-
vised a guide to better TV
viewing through horizontal hold

hypnosis, or something like that.

0 The Doris Day Show — This
show comes on weekdays — in
the late morning, I think. I don't
know what channel it's on, but

the only part worth watching is

the beginning, when they play

the theme song ”Que Sera Sera,”

and Doris lays on this huge, sick-
eningly elated grin. That grin
alone is worth tuning in_ for.

0 Star Trek — Again, I really
don’t know what channel it's on,
but I think it's on Sundays. We're
not talking cartoons or the next
generation. You have to watch
the real thing or nothing at all. I
love you, Captain Kirk.

0 You Can't Do That On TeIe'-
vision — I know for sure it's on
Nickelodeon. It's really a kids’
show, but they've got this great
green slime they dump on un-
suspecting pubescents. It's a fun
time.

0 MTV -— What television

‘guide would be complete

without the mention of the monu-
ment to the short attention span?
My favorite guest DJ was Julie
Brown — the other Julie Brown,
that is. The homecoming queen's
got a gun.

0 The "How to pay your cable
bill” show — Confused? Frustrat-
ed? Don't know how to lick a.

Are you wearing a miniskirt, Tina?

By Mary Campbell

Associated Press Writer

NEW YORK —- A decade ago,
Tina Turner went out on her own,
bringing to an end her marriage
and the raunchy rock act, known
as the Ike and Tina Turner Revue,
which had produced such hits as
"Proud Mary.’.’

She didn't exactly take the mu-
sic world by storm when her solo
LP, Rough, came out in 1978. But
six years later, Tina Turner made
an astounding comeback with
Private Dancer. The album

produced numerous hits and

won three Grammy Awards, in-
cluding song and record of the
year for her first ever No. 1 sin-
gle, "What's Love Got to Do
With It?"

The album also made the sultry
singer the goddess of rock. She's
a triumph in the comeback
world, an independent 47-year-
old woman who can prance
about in spike heels and short
skirts and captivate teenyboppers
as well as their parents.

Turner is on a yearlong world
tour that began in Europe, to pro-
mote her latest LP, Break Every

Rule. When the tour ends on
April 1, 1988, she plans to return
to acting. She recently discussed
her career in an interview with
The Associated ‘Press.

Q: When you sing live, do you
try to sound the way you do on
your albums?

A: I changed my music a bit
and made it more rock 'n' roll,
performance-wise. On the al-
bum, you don't feel you're listen-
ing to a rock ’n’ roll album. The
show is lively.

Q: How do you cope with per-
forming every night?

A: In America, I sometimes
have four nights in a row. In
Europe, some weeks I did seven.

4 Q: Do you still wear miniskirts
and straw-stack wigs on stage?

A: My dresses are short  I ‘
never relate to them as minis. No '

dancer dances in long clothes.
My style over the years has been
basically the same because of my
type/ of work. Now it's classier.

My punk hair is an image thing.
People expect it.

Q: Do you plan your_career
yourself, or do you rely on some-
one else to help you make de-

cisions?

A: It is my plan. It is my dream.
Roger [Davies, her manager] is
there to help me manifest that.

Q: Did you expect your solo
career to become the major suc-
cess it is?

A: No. I thought about getting
with a record company and try-

ing to secure myself financially. '

Q: You were in Tommy in
1975 and Mad Max Beyond
Thunderdome in 1985. When
did you decide you wanted to
act?

A: I alwayswanted to act; it's
my all-time dream to act.

Q: Your book, I, Tina, written
with Kurt Loder, has just come
out in paperback. Are you con-
sidering writing another book?

A: l’l| write another book when
I have time off, in my words. It'll
be about how I've learned to live
— health, stamina, a new way of
thinking. I’m_ less stressful now
and live a bitmore harmonious-
Iy, and life is much easier.

Profile: Rush

Rush travels the

world to record
their latest album

It is really hard to believe that Hold Your Fire is our 72th studio
album — in 13 years together. But then it's also hard to believe in
the expanding universe, superconductors, indoor baseball, 3-D mo-
vies, artificial sweetener, offensive weapons, objective reality 

What?

Those are the words of Neil Peart as he recounts the making of

Rush’s latest album Hold Your Fire. Just as Power Windows used the ‘

theme of power, Hold Your Fire is based around a central theme —
instinct. Peart originally began working with the concept of time, writ-
ing the song ”Time Stand Still.” Soon, though, he found his original

"concept had evolved into something different.

”The theme suddenly changed to Instinct  the idea of primeval
or subconscious drives. Well OK, I thought, if that's what my brain
wants to work on — go ahead.”

A month later Peart joined Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson in Ontario
where Lee and Lifeson worked together on musical ideas, and Peart
concentrated on lyrics. Then, in the evenings, they would get together
to turn the new ideas into music.

"This is a very important part of the process, working so closely
together and creating new things. Of course, nothing is ever accom-
plished without a struggle, and sometimes what you're working on
seems like it will never turn out any good,” 2.5.1 .7 "eart.

Soon, the serious recording began at The Manor, in Oxfordshire,
England where the basic tracks for Power Windows were also record-
ed. Three weeks later the drums, bass, basic keyboards, guide gui-
tars and guide vocals were finished, and Rush moved from the Ridge
Farm Studio, ‘also in England, to Montserrat, a small island in the
Caribbean to continue recording. Next, the band returned to Toron-
to to add -certain small bits to the album.

”We had not worked in Toronto for, oh, about 10 years, fearing
too many distractions — however enjoyable and well meant — from
family and friends. But it does get harder to be away from home all
the time, and for once, we thought we'd like to try a small part of
this project at home,” explained Peart.

Finally, Rush finished recording Hold Your Fire in Paris. The al-
bum has already been released in the United States and can be found

at most record stores.

In the Nov. 4 issue of The Pitt News Alex Coleman was incorrectly

' referred as a choreographer for the Three Rivers Shakespeare Fes-

tival. Coleman is a fight choreographer.

Auburn set for showdown with Seminoles

By Vince Longo
Staff Writer

The South's answer to the
Oklahoma-Texas rivalry takes
place this Saturday at a neutral
site, the Gator Bowl, in Jackson-
ville, Fla. The game may have lost
some of its luster as a result of Au-
burn's 29-6 drubbing of Florida

last week, but it's still arguably -

the best rivalry in the South and
one of the most colorful — hav-
ing once been referred to as the
biggest outdoor cocktail party in
the world.

Not to be outdone are Florida
State and Auburn. This game

I thought Auburn was slightly
overrated until they trounced
Florida, 29-6. Quarterback Jeff
Burger has been cleared by the
NCAA of wrongdoing in accept-
ing an airplane ride from a
booster. Actually, Burger’s
penalty, which was imposed by
Auburn University, was that he
couldn't ‘start last week against
Florida. So he sat out the first play
and then came" in to throw for
220 yards and one touchdown.

For some people, the idea of
going to college is to get away
from Mom, Dad and the other si-
blings. This is not the case with
Pitt's Miller brothers.

" Ed Miller, Pitt's starting center,
was joined this past September
by his younger brother Scott, also
a promising center.

‘ Ed is pleased with the fact his
younger brother followed him to
Pitt. V

good idea of what a younger

playershould expect when he

first comes into a system such as
Pitt's. .

"|t’s also good for our parents.
Instead of having to travel to two
different schools during the sea-
son, they are able to travel _to one.
I think they also like the idea that
I'm here to help Scott out with ad-
justing to college life."

Oh yes, there is one more
thing. i ‘

”The only part that's a pain,”
Ed Miller said with a smile‘, "is

was well stocked at the time,
featuring current Kansas City
Chiefs star Bill Maas, among
others. Rather than keep Miller
idle, the coaches decided to try
him at center, a position that had
been thin because of injury.
Miller has remained there for the
duration of his career.

He got a chance to play early’
in his first season, starting seven
games in his new position. Just as
he started excelling, disaster
struck. Miller went down with-.a

When Miller speaks of this

”This team reminds me of the

Miller said. ”Neither team was

we're doing pretty well. I feel if
we play together as a team and
improve throughout the season,
then at the end of the season,
everyone will share in the in-
dividual awards. No one player
stands out; it’s a total team
effort.”

Regarding personal goals and
the future, Miller is realistic.

”When I finish with football
this year, I'll have to wait and see
what my options are,” Miller
said. "I would like to go on and

Giantsto

search for new home

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) ~— The
defeat of a plan to build a down-
town stadium means the San
Francisco Giants will be looking
for a new home, club owner Bob
Lurie said.

”The Giants will not be in San
Francisco,” Lurie told a news
conference after Tuesday's elec-
tion defeat of a proposition that
would have replaced Candlestick
Park with an $80 million ball-
park. ”There are lots of cities

across the country that are dying

for the Giants.”

Lurie, whose lease on Candle-
stick expires in 1994, said, ”I will
be talking to a lot of different
communities, starting in 1988. I'll
consider anyplace that wants us.”

Not everyone believes him.

Ex-San Francisco Mayor
George Christopher was skepti-
cal. ”I don't think it means any-
thing ...” he said of the
Proposition W loss.

”We have seen Lurie change
his mind before, and I don't think

anybody believes he would turn
down a downtown ballpark if a
site like Third and Mission were
made available ...” said Dan
Woodhead, president of the
Downtown‘ Ballpark Boosters
Club, adding that there is plenty
of time for more negotiations on
a new stadium.

It has long been Lurie’s conten-
tion that the Giants, traditionally
one of the worst teams in the Na-
tional League in terms of atten-
dance, would do far better if they
played in a stadium that was not
as chilly, windswept and inacces-
sible as Candlestick.

”A lot of improvements have
been made, but you can't put ear-
rings on a pig," said Giants catch-
er Bob Brenly. ”It’s always going
to be windy, and it’s always go-
ing to be cold.”

But fans did turn out this past
season, breaking all past records
as 1.9 million watched the Giants
capture the NL West title.

Nevertheless, Lurie and others

pursued plans for a 42,000—seat

stadium to be built at Seventh '

and Townsend streets in down-
town San Francisco. They asked
for a public endorsement by
voters and promised that funds
for the project would be raised
through private contributions.

Should the contributions fail,
they warned, the city's hotel tax
funds would be tapped.

The measure was defeated.

53.2 percent to 46.8 percent.

Christopher said the election
outcome should have been ex-
pected: ”Lying to the public is not
any way to win any kind of bal-
lot of initiative..The most mislead-
ing statement was that there
would be no charge to the
taxpayer.”

Critics of Proposition W also

complained of increased traffic,
noise, litter and crime around the
Seventh and Townsend site.

San Francisco voters were not
the only ones to reject a baseball
stadium.

just that the offense really didn't
seem to be going anywhere and
maybe needed a change, and
Darnell fulfilled that ' needed
change. _
”|’ve been fighting decisions
like this all year and in every po-
sition. It just all comes down to
winning.” ‘ J

But the funny thing aboutit all

isthat Rutgers head coach Dick
Anderson is in just about the
same situation as Gottfried with
his own quarterbacks. Rutgers’
usual starting passer, Scott Erney,
will be out for the game with in-
jured left knee ligaments, and An-
derson is going to commence
with the‘ inexperienced talents of
sophomore quarterback John
Murphy.

”With Scott Erney, we had just
gotten to the point where we all
thought he was looking pretty
good, and then something like
this happens,” said Anderson.
”At this point in the season, it
doesn't make much sense to
change things. Consistency
pleases me, both with games and
with players, but we haven't been
able to see much of either lately.

”We think John has the ability
to adapt and to play with poise
and to be able tosee things with
all the pressure on him,” Ander-
son continued.

’’All I can say is that when you
go into a situation like this just
about anything can happen.”

But, while Anderson reserves
comment on his own starter, he
does have definite feelings on
Dickerson.

”Dickerson gives the Pitt
offense an extra added dimen-
sion,” he said. ’’I don't really
know if we need that right now.”

Talk is still being thrown

around about possible bowl‘

games, and both coaches have
heard the squawk. However, the

. both have different views on the

subject.

”If we can beat Pitt this
weekend, our hopes will still be
alive,’’ said Anderson.

”The only thing we have to
worry about this week is Rut-
gers,’_’ said Gottfried. ’’If you
merit that type of post-season ac-
tion, then it will come to you.
We'll worry about that if and
when we get there.”

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, November 5, I987

Special attitude makes

O’Shau

By Don Boyd

For the Pitt, News

The Pitt women's volleyball
team is the proud possessor of
a 30-2 record, the last 22 wins
coming in succession. One of
the keys to the Lady Panthers’
phenomenal success has been
the inspirational play of senior
setter Louise O’Shaughnessy.
In the recent Pitt Invitational
Volleyball Tournament (Oct.
23 and 24), O’Shaughnessy
walked away with MVP
honors while leading the team
to victory.

Louise O’Shaughnessy is a
French major from Toronto,
Ontario. How the four-sport
athlete (basketball, ice hockey,
soccer and volleyball) from
Clarkson Secondary School
came to Pitt isa story in itself.
Pitt's head volleyball coach,
Shelton Collier, was in Toron-
to scouting a top Canadian
player at a tournament. Colli-
er left the tournament and
decided to stop off and watch
another tournament, where he
spotted O’Shaughnessy. Colli-
er’s first impression of Louise:
”She was a good volleyball
player, but she had a special
attitude.”

Collier quickly let O’S-
haughnessy know that there
was a place for her at Pitt, if

ghnessy better

she was interested. O’Shaugh-
nessy, who had planned on at-
tending the University of
Western Ontario, decided to
visit Pitt. She remembered her
impressions of that visit: ”I
really liked the girls on the
team and Shelton [Collier]. I
decided to give Pittsburgh a
try.”

As a freshman,. O’Shaugh-
nessy was a part—time starter as
an outside hitter and ”was a
key reason why we won the
Big East tournament,” accord-
ing to Collier. Louise was a
full—time starter her sophomore
year at outside hitter. Prior to
her junior year, Pitt was una-
ble to recruit a setter, so Colli-
er attempted to convert her
into a setter. Even though she
had never played the position,
O’Shaughnessy willingly went
along with the experiment.

This year, Louise was
named captain of the team,
perfectly understandable as
her coach commented, ”She is
a classic example of hard work
paying off for an athlete.” Her
play has improved this season
to the point where Collier can-
didly stated, ”She is definitely
the No. 1 setterin the Big East
and arguably the best setterin
the East.”

O’Shaughnessy has set
some goals for the remainder

of the season. ”I would like to_
win the Big East and advance
past the first round of the
NCAA tournament, which
would put us in the top 16
teams in the country. That
would give Lisa Stewart and
Denise Frawley a legitimate
chance at-making the All-
America team,” remarked
O’Shaughnessy.

O’Shaughnessy has been an
asset to the Pitt team off the
court as well. She helped
recruit freshman Michele‘
Adamson from her hometown
”because I knew Pitt would be
the greatest thing that ever
happened to her. The people
I have played with and the
people associated with the
team are the greatest people I
know,” she said.

LADY PANTHER NOTES:
The Lady Panthers will be
competing this weekend at the
Ohio State Classic. Pitt will
play host team to Ohio State
in the opening round, while
Penn State will play the
University of Cincinnati. Win-
ners advance to the champion-
ship round, and the losers play
in the consolation match. The
Lady Panthers, with their 22
consecutive wins, have the na-
tion’s longest, current winning
streak in Division I volleyball.

Initially, Chuck became in-

stated Chuck. ”He played in bars
every weekend and would come
home with $30 or $40 every
night.” Then, Farinella got a part-

allowed to play. That year, he
won the" Pitt tournament, the
regional tournament, and played
in the national tournament.

Dunne finishes second
for Rookie of the Year

ymI. '
5'4 .i .
m"

 

NEW YORK (AP) - San Diego
catcher Benito Santiago, who hit
safely in 34 straight games to es-
tablish a first-season record, was
a unanimous‘ selection as the

I Jackie Robinson Rookie of the

Year in the National League, the
Baseball Writers Association of
America announced Wednesday.

Santiago, who batted .300, hit
18 home runs, drove in 79 runs
and stole 21 bases, received 120
points, while runner-up Mike
Dunne, a pitcher for the Pitts-
burgh Pirates, had 66 points —_
drawing, 22 second-place votes.

Pitcher Joe Magrane of the St.
Louis Cardinals finished third
with 10 points. ’

Two writers from each of the
league's 12 cities participated in
the voting, which was conduct-
ed at the end of the regular sea-
son. Points were awarded on a
5-3-1 basis.

Santiago, a- native of Puerto
Rico, became the fifth NL rookie
to be acclaimed‘ unanimously.
The others were Frank Robinson,
Cincinnati, 1956; Orlando Cepe-
da, San Francisco, 1958; Willie
McCovey, San Francisco, 1959;
and Vince Coleman, St. Louis,
1985.

Mark McGwire of the Oakland
Athletics was named American

League Rookie of the Year on
Tuesday. He also was a unami-
mous selection.

Santiago broke Jimmy Wil-
liams’ all-time rookie record of
hitting in 27 straight games for the
1899 Pittsburgh Pirates. The
modern record had been Guy
Curtright’s 26 straight with the
1943 Chicago White Sox.

Santiago’s streak was stopped
on the last Saturday of the season
by Los Angeles Dodgers right-
hander Orel Hershiser.

On the negative side, Santiago
made 22 errors.

Santiago is only the”fifth catch-
er — and the first in 15 years 7-
tobe selected the top rookie. The
others were Johnny Bench and
Earl Williams in the NL, and
Thurman Munson and Carlton
Fisk in the American League.

The only other Padre to win
rookie honors was reliever Butch
Metzger in 1976, when he shared
the award with Cincinnati right-
hander Pat Zachary.

”lt’s not surprising that he hit
in so many straight, but the fact
that he's a rookie catcher and has
so many other things to worry
about besides hitting is what
made it more amazing,” team-
mate Tony Gwynn said of

 

Santiago.

”We expected this out of him,
but we didn't have any idea he
had this kind of ability,” Padres
General Manager Jack McKeon
said. ”|t’s very difficult to pre-
judge a guy in April and say he's
going to put these kind of num-
bers on the board.”

The Padres, who got off to a
12-42 start, finished the season
last in the NL West at 65-97.

After spending the first two
months.of the season looking for
fastballs and swinging for the
fences, Santiago adjusted his
stroke for the breaking ball.

Santiago’s streak, which ‘started
Aug. 25, was the second longest
in the major leagues this year
beind the 39-game mark by Mil-
waukee’s Paul Molitor.

During the streak, Santiago bat-
ted .346, going 47-for-136 with
‘five homers and 18 RBI.

Dunne, who was called up by
Pittsburgh on June 1, finished the
season with a 13-6 record and a
3.03 earned-run average. The
Pirates acquired him along with
outfielder Andy Van Slyke and
catcher Mike LaVa|liere from the
St. Louis Cardinals prior to the
start of the season for catcher
Tony Pena. "
