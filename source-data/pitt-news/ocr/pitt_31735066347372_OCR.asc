Bates Files Appeal-

New Hearing Unlikely 

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

The appeal of a Student
Government Judicial Board (SGJB)
hearing ﬁled by candidate Michael

Bates Monday does not warrant a I
V new hearing, according to Associate

Director of Student Activities Terry
Milani.

“On the has-
is of what was
submitted there
will be no ap-
peal hearing
scheduled,” _
Milani said. .-

ELECTION

 

The hearing was originally schedul-
ed for tonight.

Milani said the appeal submitted’

Monday is not specific enough.
Bates has until today to produce a
more complete explanation of how
he was denied due process.

Last week, the Office of Student
Activities postponed the ' Student
Government election one week to
allow Bates to appeal SGJ B hearing

that upheld a previous ruling not to
permit candidates Bates and Sally
Shoup a place on the ballot.

— The Student Government Elec-
tion Committee (SGEC) denied
Bates and candidate Sally Shoup
ballot spots because each submitted

.his transcripts after the 4 p.m.
January 7 deadline.

According to Milani, Bates '

explained last week he would
appeal the decision on the basis of
improprieties in the Judicial Board
hearing, claiming SGB President
Barry Weisband said something to
members of the SGJB that would
prejudice them against his~'case.
Weisband denied involvement in
any improper procedures.

The substance of the appeal
Bates submitted does not charge
improprieties in the Judicial Board
hearing, but instead ‘cites inade-
quacies in the election code and an
alleged lack of adherence to the
code by the SGEC.

Trustee Meeting Disrupted 4

BY BILL Moon

The Pitt Board of Trustees
adjourned its meeting yesterday
after only 15 minutes I when
members of the Student Committee
to Defend Paul Nyden disrupted the
proceedings after“ being refused
permission to read a four-page
statement on Nyden’s dismissal.

Two members of the Nyden
committee, Terri Farrow and Risha
Thompkins, demanded the right to

speak’ minutes after’ the meeting
was called to order, and continued
to read their statement while the‘
trustees attempted to conduct their
business.

The Nyden supporters maintained
they were being denied the right to
speak despite ' their requests
through the proper channels while
Board Chairman William Rea and
Chancellor Wesley Posvar argued
that the Nyden group had ignored
procedure, and were ‘ ‘only interest-

...the sub-zero temperatures closed classes, allowing some
courageous students to take advantage of their unprecedented 

ed in staging a public demonstra-
tion.”

Following the adjournment, Rea a

told reporters the Nyden supporters
had been invited tospeak before the
Academic Affairs Committee of the

Trustees earlier that day, which he,

said was necessary before they
could be granted the right to
address the entire Board. “This is
not a new rule, it was not
improvised just for the Nyden case
at all. It is standard operating
procedure for the University,” Rea
said.

‘ ‘I can only conclude that they are
not interested in appearing before
the Board, except as a public
demonstration,” Rea said.

Nyden, who has been appealing I

his dismissal as an assistant
professor of sociology since last
year, was present at the meeting,
but did not attempt to speak. ‘ ‘I felt
they should have let the students
speak,” he said following the
adjournment. “The ironic thing is
that it would have only taken about
10 minutes.”

Asked if he believed the students
acted correctly in refusing to be
seated, Nyden" said he “would not
criticize what they did.” He said he

was not involved in "planning the ~

demonstration, however. _

The trustees managed to address
a few items of business before the
premature adjournment, including
the authorization of 1,513 degrees
for December, 1976, graduates.
They tabled a number of items at
Rea’s suggestion.

The Nyden supporters, including

Pitt Closing
Due to Low  

Temperatures

BY JOE HAYDEN

The University, closed yesterday
due to sub-zero temperaturesand
heating fuel shortages, will cut back
the temperatures in all buildings
today.

The decision to close yesterday ,

came from Chancellor Wesley
Posvar and Vice Chancellor for
Business and Finance ‘Joseph
Dutton after Governor Milton
Shapp declared a state of emer-
gency in Pennsylvania at 5 p.m.
Monday due to severe energy
shortages. '
“We feel it is our civic duty to
conserve fuel in light of the energy

crisis we are facing,” Mary‘Ann_
Aug, Pitt’s associate director of"

News and Publications, said late
yesterday. .

Pitt uses coal for most of its
general heating purposes, but coal
shipments are delayed because of
the area’s ice-jammed rivers. Only

IRS Withdraws Plan
To Tax Tuition Benefits

BY DEANNA LOUISE

. The Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) has indeﬁnitely tabled a
proposal to tax tuition benefits for
college employes‘ spouses and
children following a barrage of
gripes from institutes of higher

education.
The proposal, if pursued by

upcoming‘IRS inaugurates. would
increase the tax base of many Pitt
employes whose spouses and
children receive tuition benefits by
thousands of dollars, even though

the employes’ salaries’ would.

remain the same.

b The protest is overwhelming,
according to Pitt Director of Legal
Services William Hannon. Several
higher education groups, including
the American Council on Education
and the National Association of
College and University Business
Officers. are presenting arguments
against the proposal‘.

' The proposal treats the amount
of tuition remitted as “compensa-
tion to the employe for services
provided by the employe, unless
the employe could establish that
the program is not compensatory in
nature.” (

Opposition lobbyists are pointing
to ambiguities in the proposal that
leave unclear the circumstances
that determine whether a tuition
beneﬁt program is compensatory,
or how an employe can establish
that one is not compensatory.

At Pitt.
president William Massey, Staff
Advisory Board Chairman Karen
Adams and the Chancellor's office
sent letters of objection, because.

University Senate’

Hannon said, “the taxation would
be on benefits which are scholar-~
ships for the students and do not
constitute a form of compensa-
tion."

“All Pitt employes get the same
tuition benefits which are for their
children, not for themselves,"
Hannon said. T

Pitt's tuition remission program
includes free tuition for all
University employes’ spouses and
children. and partial remission for
faculty who earn more than $17,500
annually and opt to send their
children to other institutions.

At other universities tuition-
beneﬁt programs vary greatly to
include free or discounted tuition at
an employe’s institution, grant
programs under which a college
pays part of the cost for employes’
dependents enrolled in any college,
and exchange programs providing
full or partial remission of tuition at
another participating institution.

According to the IRS, student
groups also have protested the
proposed tax amendment by
arguing the costs of free tuition for
college employe’s children would
be less than the tax costs to them if
the regulation was passed.

The first notice of the govem-
ment‘s attempts to tax tuition

beneﬁts came in November when» A

the IRS made a comprehensive
attempt to tax many employe
benefits, including such things as
“free air service for the spouses of
travel service employes."

“But these, benefits, unlike
education, are not for the better-
ment of society," Hannon said.

Bates Election Appeal

(Continued from Page I)
- Bates said he did not submit an

appeal on the basis of improprieties
because it would involve profes-
sional ethics, and there is nothing in
the ‘Student Government constitu-
tion regarding that.

“The .IudicialBoard was fair in

its handling of the case,” Bates
said.

Milani said the appeals mechan-

ism was created and the subsequent
postponement of the election
occurred because Student Activities
wanted to provide due process for
Bates. Last week. Milani explained
the SGJB appeal would not have
been considered if it were not for the

alleged improprieties. There is no

Stresses SGEC Code

existing mechanism to process an
appeal of an SGJB decision.

“Basically I am appealing on the
basis of denial of due process,”
Bates said yesterday." “Afterthat
meeting I did not receive anything
written to allow me to prepare a
good appeal.” '

According to Ron Long, SGEC
co-chairman, the provisions cited in
the Bates appeal apply only to
hearings and not to SGEC meetings
on certiﬁcation of candidates.

One section of the Bates
statement bases the appeal on the
lack of proper provisions in the code
to allow for an appeal of these
provisions.

Pitt Closing  

Due to Low
Temperatures p

(Continued from Page I)

25 carloads of coal remain in Pitt’s
stockpiles, with no relief in sight.
Aug said. L .

Until the shortage is eased, the
Bellefield Boiler Plant, Pitt’s source
of steam heat, will burn only
330,000 pounds of coal per hour
instead of 440,000 pounds per hour.

Yesterday's closing was the first
time Pitt has shut down since 1950.
when a snow storm crippled the
entire city, Aug said. It also is the
first time Pitt has closed because of’
sub~zero temperatures and energy

‘ shortages, she said.

“We are expecting the tempera-
ture to rise 15 degrees on
Wednesday and Thursday,” Aug
said, “but we will basically play it
by ear as the days go by and hope for‘
higheritemperatures.”

Disrupts

Dr. Nyden, criticized the University
for having a number of plainclothes
campus police officers on hand for
the meeting in Stephen Foster
Memorial.

Posvar termed the presence of
the officers. including Chief Curt
Graham, a “precautionary mea-
sure."

“I don't know what they
expected,” Nyden said of the
plainclothesmen. “I never had any
inkling that anyone intended the
slightest violent action.” I

Conserve Or Freeze

The northeastern portion of the country is on the brink of disaster. Not
only is the natural gas supply so short that industry must cut back, but it
also looks as if home heating may suffer, too.

Pittsburgh area residents had it lucky yesterday. The temperature
dropped to merely six degrees below zero, instead of hovering in the
neighborhood of twenty below. Sure, winter is a great season to have

around. But not when it’s this cold.

’ There’s some good news and bad news associated with recent
meteorological developments. First, the good news. .. . .

_Yesterday’s expected drain in the natural gas‘ supply‘ never
materialized but the present situation is not yet on the mend. The
University of Pittsburgh is open today. So are some of the other

institutions that had to close down.

‘Now the bad news. The city schools are still closed. Some other
schools will be closed the entire week. And layoffs by industries
continue along the  rivers in order to further conservance of natural

gas. .

What the public doesn’t realize isjhow close it came to losing
residential heating because of a lack of natural gas. They weren’t
exactly sitting around waiting for the eve of destruction, but the
situation was quite serious. And it will stay serious unless conservation
methods are stepped up and kept up until temperatures return within a

ballpark ﬁgure of normal.

That’s why industry has yet to call back any men laid off. That’s why

city schools willstay closed today.

As stated earlier, the situation is still’ serious. If thousands of the
area’s gas-ﬁred furnaces fail from lack of natural gas, residents can’t
exactly stay and freeze to death. What will the state and city do with

them?

Which is why it is essential that the conservation continue. The truth
is that’ conservation should be a year-round effort so we don’t ﬁnd

V ourselves in the same mess this ﬁrne next year.

But for now we must face the next few days, which will be warmer, but
not warm enough. Those who are gas consumers can do their part.
Lower your thermostat to 65 degrees. Limit your use of hot water,
reduce the thermostat setting of your hot water heater. Use electric
space heaters, electric blankets. Sleep with a friend.

This williall be over in a few days. What is done now can save a lot of
pain, discomfort and bother in the meantime. What is done in future
months can save us much more in the winters to come.

 

All Whites Racist to a Point

BY GARY GOVERT

“This 4th of July is« yours, not
mine.” V

The above statement. excerpted
from last Thursday's BAS presen-
tation of “An Evening With
Frederick Douglass." strikes me as
an excellent representation of the
spirit of racism. Speaking to an
Independence Day, 1852, crowd of
liberal white folks. Douglass, an
eloquent abolitionist whose motiva-
tions stemmed in part from his
status as a fugitive slave. was
telling his audience that their
celebration of freedom meant
nothing to him or the people he
represented.

Although a lot has happened
since.l852 to soften the impact of
Douglass’ words. ‘they still ring
true. The statement is no longer so
pointed in an outward sense—-I. at
least. have never seen a real,
official slave———but' the message
remains clear and urgent. As long
as we‘, white and black, carry with
us the burden of visceral r'acism——

he would occasionally start his

prodding of the social conscience
is.iof course. useful and noble, but
standing alone it can lead us only
half-way to the problem's end.
Since “one’s own" racism gets so
little at1ention——the liberals ima-
gine themselves free of it and the
conservatives think it justified——we
may be left. if present trends
continue. with the paradox of
having eliminated everyone's rac-
ism while retaining our.own.

lfl am qualified to talk about
racism at ‘all. it is only the
undeniable fact of my own
prejudice that renders me so.
Being a white male. and one who
has not yet encountered “reverse
discrimination." my gut-level con-
frontations with racism have been
minimal; most familiar is the
internal uneasiness I feel when I
realize I have imagined something
about someone simply because he
or she was not white. As a result. if
I am to discourse on the topic of
racism. it appears that —l am best
qualified to speak about my own.
and perhaps somewhat qualified to
talk about that of white people in
general. I probably ought to leave
the problem of racism among
blacks and other minorities to those
more familiar with the subject.

Unless lam radically unlike most
other human persons, it follows
that most. if not all. people are

‘victims of visceral racism in one

form or another (here. of course.
the “vietims'~' are at the same time
the vietimizers).

Visceral racism is not quite as
easily identifiable as a Ku Klux
Klan cross burning. but it's quite a
bit more common.
woman walking alone on a dark
street reacts to the passing of a
black man any differently than she
would were he white. is that not

racism‘? She hardly needs to spit
onlhim or call him a name—that
barely perceptible abdominal
clutch identifies the attitude quite
succinctly. Even if statistics should
show that black men are more
likely than white men to be
rapists-—whichI doubt—there
would remain in the “clutching"
described above something more
than mathematical analysis.‘
0r——more subtly still——how
about the white man who, despite
his denial of prejudice. keeps his
money in a savings and loan that

. follows a policy of “red-lining"
—p0or blacks and other minorities

when it comes to home ownership
or home-improvement loans? He
might use the seemingly reason-
able (but untrue) excuse that “all
banks do it" and claim he has no
choice. but isn't he.‘ by simply

doing nothing. acting as a racist?

Again. I use whites as examples
because I am most familiar with the
habits of that race. especially as
they are reflected in me; blacks and
other ethnic groups know better
than 1 the shapes of their own
prejudices.

Inasmuch as it seems that all the
liberality and ‘anti-racist rhetoric in
the world has not delivered us from
our visceral racism. we probably
ought to devote at least as much
time to examining what is behind
our own racism as we spend
vilifying “everyone else’s. ' ' More
than that. we ought to be involved
in concrete efforts against racism.
Real. physical involvement will do
more to defeat visceral racism than
meditating (or writing) about it.
and only when all kinds of racism
are gone can anything be “ours"
rather than “yours" or “mine.

It’s Trivia Time Again

BY MARK PRESCOTT

So you consider yourself a real trivia buff? Well, whether you do or
not, here is a little quiz to test just how good you really are.

If you ‘do exceptionally well on this quiz, you should call your parents
and inform them you’re really not as dumb as your Q.P.A. indicated last
term. One final thing--good luck. ’

1. Any true trivia buff should be able to name the original drummer of
the Beatles. And, please, whatever you do, don’t say Ringo, because
that is not the answer.

2. I’m sure everyone knows that Clint Eastwood plays “Dirty Harry,”
but how many of you know the full name of the character he plays?

. 3. While we are on the subject of Clint Eastwood, see if you can
rememberthe name of the TV show he starred in awhile back. And if you
are a real trivia expert, name the character helplayed.

4. Here is an easy question. Eric Carmen (“All By Myself”) used to
be lead singer with what fruity and ﬂavorful group?

5. I’m sure everyone remembers the TVshow the Beverly Hillbillies,
correct? But how many people out there can remember the names of the
banker and his secretary. Also, for the real trivia connoisseur, see if you
can think of those performers’ real names. , -

6. Who were the three actors that starred in the movie The Good, the
Bad and the Ugly. Also, match each of these actors to the words in the
title that described him. .

7, I can’t think of a better way to end this quiz then with a gimme
(simple question). This way your confidence will be restored and you
can return to the wonderful world of college. Who played Steve Douglas
in the TV show My Three Sons?

‘ BY PETE BUTCH

In this age of quick food and
mass produced hamburgers, it's
hard to ﬁnd a place to eat that
offers a good sandwich and beer at
a reasonable price.

But one needn't look farther than
the Richest Delicatessen on Stan-
wix Street. downtown. At first
glance you'd swear the place hasn't
changed in at least ﬁfteen years.

The bartender stands behind the
bar with an array of cheap and
expensive whiskeys, gin. vodka
and exotic liquers. He's stereotyp-
ically moonlighting on his 40-hour-

per-week job and knows every

regular customer by name.

A waitress comes over with the
menu. Clipped inside are two
dog-eared. mimeographed pages.
Perusing its contents, one finds

beer at $.60, $.75, and $1.00-

depending on whether domestic,
premium or imported is desired.
And the sandwiches. an endless
list, range between $1.00 to $1.50
and $2.00 to $2.50, for regular and
double-decker creations. Their

5 price depends on the ingredients,

which can be any permutation or
combination of corned beef, turkey.
chopped‘ liver. cheese and dress-
ing. Corned beef is their speciality
and their reubens are fantastic.

Also included on the menu are
hot lunches and dinners at about
$2.50 to $3.

When the waitress comes to take
the order she brings a bowl of
sauerkraut and kosher pickles to
munch on. That’s something you
can't expect from McDonalds. The
order arrives a few minutes later.

For dessert, Richest's cheese-
cake and strawberries with a cup of
coffee is a must. They get it from a
bakery, not a deepfreeze. And the
cup of coffee is continuously
reﬁlled.

Richest's is only a few minutes
from most of the downtown
theatres, and around the corner is
Heinz Hall. After you’ve wrecked
your budget with first-run movie
tickets, try them after ..the show.
You can eat well and still have
change for the PAT bus home.

PETE STRICKLAND

His Acting Is
As ~ Good As
His Passing

There is a line in one of the
seemingly zillion plays Shakespeare

wrote that says something to the \

effect that ‘ ‘the world is a stage and
everyone is an actor.” I

A simple line, but one, neverthe-
less, containing much meaning
behind it. Every one of us, whether
we like to admit it or not, has a little
of the “ham” in him—we like to be
on center stage, so to speak.

But, as with most of us. that line
hits very close to home in the case of
Pitt basketball player Pete Strick-
land.

Strickland, a sophomore speech
major, dabbles as an actor ‘for

several Pittsburgh theatre compan-.

ies on and off campus when he isn't
playing basketball.

He works with the Demundy
Production Company and has also
performed with the Black Company
Repertoire Theatre in off-campus
productions. '

“I find acting intriguing/"

Strickland said softly.
act.” *
Fortunately for head coach Tim
Grgurich and his Panther basketball
squad, Strickland loves basketball,
too, so much so that he’s willing to
make concessions and give up
acting during basketball season.
Behind-the-back dribbles, vel-

“I love to

vety smooth passes and nifty’
down-the-court movesare all, much '

to the pleasure of the generally
disheartened Pitt fans, a part of
.Pete’s act.

0 Obviously, Strickland enjoys
what he’s doing, since he plays
guard and acts so well. He’s the
first to admit he gets a big kick out of
both diversions.

But if he had to pick a favorite of
the two, well, it boils down to what
the articulate sophomore happens
to be doing at the time.

“It's kind of hard to say what I
prefer. But I’d have to say
basketball right now because
I happen to be doing it right now.
But after the season's over, drama
would have to*be my number one
thing.”

There’s no doubt about it. drama
is the number one thing on his list of
career priorities.

“I think it's more realistic to be
an actor," Strickland said intro-
spectively. “I don’t think I could be
a pro basketball player. I love to act.
I'd like to pursue it as far as I can.

“I guess there isn’t a whole lot of
money in it. but it doesn’t matter.”
Strickland continued. “I like to do
it...and that's what I want to do."

Luckily for Pitt. Pete still likes

basketball. Grgurich and the rest of

the Panthers hope he’ll feel the
same for the next few years. too.

A Magazine is More
Than High Standards

BY ALEX K. LEVIN

A general sort of feeling
prevails around town that if a
literary magazine even makes it to
the dummy stage, that is an
accomplishment And if it makes it
onto the street; then it is a fine feat.
And if two issues in a row manage to

surface, we have on our hands a

small miracle. So speaks for the life
expectancy" of small publications.
That is why many people are
pleased to see Creative Pittsburgh,
a local publiction with emphasis on
local talent, out with its second
issue in time for -the new year—even
though a little later than promised
and a little more expensive, $2.
Creative Pittsburgh’s premier

’ was in the spring of '76. That was

an issue plagued with typographical
errors and general sloppiness. The
second issue is a lot cleaner; yet,
still there are some proofreading
and typographical errors—blatant
ones that can’t be excused. .

I’m familiar with the problems
involved in getting out a magazine
devoted to literature——soliciting
manuscripts, proofing, editing,

.fu‘nding'-—and am willing to admit
~ that just getting a magazine out is

an accomplishment, but that cannot
serve as criteria for judgment.

On the inside back cover of the
magazine, the editors boast: “It
takes more than words, trends, or

style to be literary and what it
takes, Creative Pittsburgh con-
tains.” I'm not sure if I understand
what it is that they imply their
magazine contains. Perhaps they
mean the “high quality” that they
claim as their only criteria. Well,
let's take a look and see exactly
what Creative Pittsburgh contains.

Fourteen poems and ﬁve stories

Peter Oresick have some fine

moments. But, overall,the poetry,

‘is stuff that's been thrown your way
15,000 times before: tired images,
cliches and melancholic loneliness.

K

Not one of the‘ poems sparks with
anything fresh. Nor is there one
poem that possesses any intentional
humor.

The fiction in Creative Pittsburgh
has brighter moments than the_poe-
try. Robert Allen Papinchak’s short
piece, “The Night is Far Spent,” is
a well-disciplined story involving a
woman on her deathbed wishing to
reveal a secret. The story does
suffer an occasional awkward
moment and none of the characters
are really substantial enough to
understand beyond their own
situation. -

Whereas Papinchak gives us too
little, James Gallagher, in his “A
Descendant of the Gods, ' ’ gives us a
little too much. Gallagher’s story
involves the ﬁrst—person narrative

iof a native Mexican trying to
V maintain his pride and pocketbook

as the caretaker for a crypt full of
mummies. The voice of the narrator
is consistent and very credible and
the story itself is rich in
detai1——-perhaps too rich. J udicious
editing in certain spots could have
made the story more effective. But,
even as is, the story may well be the
most memorable and different piece
in Creative Pittsburgh.

“In Search for Lost Time,” a
story by Myron Taube, provides the

Mary: Coffee and Concern

BY PAMELA EUSI

In the current film Network Peter
Finch spouts a line that is destined
to ‘ become one of the famous
one-liners in movie history: “I'm

.mad as hell and I’m not going to

take it anymore!” This quote,
meant to‘be the ultimate protest
against the thorough brainwashing
of the system and of TV networks in
particular, is one man's attempt at
revolting against them, in a very
vocal manner.

Last year, another man’s more
subtle revolution against the
system and life as millions of
people know it, in suburbia, took
shape in the form of a half-hour
television show,»Mary Hartman,
Mary Hartman. Its producer,
Norman Lear, has had several
television hits with shows such as
All in the Family. Maude, The
Jeffersons and Good Times. Most

a pilot. But this time, when he
made the rounds of the biggie TV
networks. they wouldn’t buy it.
His brainchild was too radical. too
different and the issues it dealt
with too touchy.

Lear decided to reverse his
strategies. He called together the
heads of the major independent TV
stations around the country for a
private screening of MH, MH. A
funny thing happened after that
screening. The smaller stations
had their own revolt against the
network corporations. They all
decided to buy MH, MH. g

So the little housewife from
Fernwood, Ohio became an almost
instant hit. The country went
through a Mary Hartman, Mary
Hartman phase. Publicity people
went crazy. She became the topic
of conversation at the chic-est of
cocktail parties. Posters, T-shirts,
purses, notebook covers——the

of these latter shows were spin-offs
from the parent All in the Family.
When they began to spring up.
some thought that Lear was the
master of the television genealogy.

Then Lear came up with an idea

~ for a radically different show. It
would mirror soap opera life and
deal with all the important issues of
today. He cast the show and made

whole material world discovered
Mary Hartman.

Some areas of the country were
barraged by an almost‘ instant
protest. The show was considerd
immoral and indecent, especially
when broadcast during the late
afternoon or early evening hours
when children would be most likely
to be viewing the screen.

Vt

But these complaints against
indecency have no hearing when
the show is viewed at an
appropriate adult viewing time or
on a long-term basis. This is an
adult TV show. When viewed in
only a short period of time, the
characters and their actions can be
seen as immoral and indecent. But
after a period of a few weeks one
gets the feeling of sincerity
radiated by the main core of
characters. Mary is swamped by
problems but she isgalways there
when they need her. She cares
about people and their problems.

So what if Mary has a husband
struggling to succeed yet still
reliving those glorious days of high
school? Or so what if she has a
flasher for a grandpa. a sister who
just sold her illegitimate child into
white slavery, a brat for a
daughter, a neighbor who beats his
wife and other problems that make
this show so popular? Why is the
Mary Hartman of little girl dresses
and pig-tails such a success?

One of the reasons for her
popularity has got to be that these
problems happen to everyone. The
show leaves nothing out—mas-

. turbation. bed wetting. bisexuality.

prostitution, nervous breakdowns
—-it bares all. We can all identify
at some point or other with the
dilemmas of the various characters.

The comic sense and timing of
Mary (Louise Lasser). Mary's best
friend. Loretta (Mary Kay Place).
Martha. Mary's mother .(Dody
Goodman) and some minor charac-

ters brought in to add spice to '

already-juicy story lines, is re-
freshing—al1hough sometimes
their naivete is carried to extremes
and does get a bit incredible.

Yet we believe‘ in Mary. She

only humorous moments in an
otherwise humorless magazine. It’s
a story of the efforts of a confused
teenager trying to account for an
evening blurred from his memory
by too much alcohol. As with the
Gallagher story, but even to_a larger
extent, Taube’s story tends to drag
on. This is due partially to
wordiness and partially to the idea
that most readers will have figured
out the story’s ending long before
reaching it.

The two other fiction pieces,
“Rush Job” by Daniel Byron
Edwards and “On Russian Hill” by
G. Ulrich Musinsky, are stories
made interesting by their local
backdrop, but that is all.

At first glance, Creative Pitts-
burgh gives a nice appearance with
its tan paper and brown ink, but
closer examination reveals a
certainly unprovocative layout,
questionable mixture of typefaces
and drawings that at best are rigid.
One exception is the interesting
illustration of a statue accompany-
ing the Gallagher story.

Creative Pittsburgh claims to’

in

J

publish the “literature that major
literary magazines pass by. ’ ’ I_think
there were reasons most of the work
was passed by.

Creative Pittsburgh obviously

has a dedicated staff, as witnessed
by its existence and determination

for quality. But a magazine must do ‘U

more than exist-—it must be
memorable. And to be memorable
it must not be staid. The content of
Creative Pittsburgh lacks original-
ity, experimentation and, most of
all, humor. And a humorless
magazine is just not enjoyable.

If Creative Pittsburgh will sur-
vive-—as literary fans hope it
can—it must get away from the
dullness that possesses it and be
truly creative, not afraid to give us
the different and interesting work
that is passed over by traditional-
magazines. Certainly, it does take
more than words and style to be
literary, but without originality and
quality in those two facets, all else is
useless.

. Joplin: A Voice For

TheSixties’ Passion

BY RON NYSWANER

Janis Joplin was born 34 years ago today.

Joplin has become a symbol of the era for which she sang. Her voice,
crackling and scratchy when she took it low, is more often remembered
reaching hard and high, jumping over rambling lyrics, driven by a

forceful passion.

The passion of J oplin’s singing was like that of her lifestyle. Although
often self—indulgent, this passion hinted to the possibility that its owner,
like her generation, was passing beyond indulgence to something more _

important. . '

FROM THE BALCONY
That generation struggled—-—sometimes modestly, often militantly-—
for the freedom to indulge, as well as for the chance to make changes. Id

and superego existed simultaneously in reckless excesses and
social-political crusades. Joplin certainly knew the excesses, but only

came close to the consciousness.

Her death in‘1970 better symbolizes the decade she had just begun

rather than the one left behind.

A heroin overdose ended the

“superhypermost’3 Jopliniwas riding upon. Her life ended just as the
inpact her generation made began to fade away.

In the Stagnant Seventies, former campus radicals have become
corporate lawyers. Recklessness has turned to carelessness; agitation
has given way to the catch-word of this decade: Apathy. Suddenly, the
world has become “mellow” (and I have begun to hate that word).

Joplin died not for any cause, nor any conviction.

Causes and

convictions belong to a generation past-—Joplin’s empty death ﬁts

better the decade that survived her.

“Freedom's,” Joplin once sang,

“just another word for nothing left to lose.” Today, it seems, this is the
only freedom we care to look for. or, perhaps, are able to find.

O m Harris May
Lead Singer For Pitt

8 BY CRIS HALL

 

Be New

PHILADELPHIA—Driving to the hotel after his team’s 21-point loss
to Villanova last weekend, Panther forward Larry Harris was listening to
the radio, singing along. Suddenly, almost strangely, an announcer
broke the string of songs and uttered a fortune-cookie phrase: “There is
no crime in trying to produce—the crime is in having to produce.”

Harris stopped singing and listened, then thought.

This season, now 3-11 for Pitt’s
-basketball team, has not been “a
particularly enjoyable one for
Harris. A 22-point scorer last
season, the 6-6 junior from Lorain,
Ohio, was counted upon to provide
everything but popcorn at Pitt
games this season. But, as has been
the case with the entire Pitt team,

things haven’t been as Harris
v genvisioned or likes them. '

/“We’ve won three games,” he
said after the Villanova loss.
"Three...lousy...games.”

Though most Pitt followers
attribute Pitt’ 5 lack of wins to lack of

' experience, some blame Harris,

sometimes loudly.

“People think I have to score 20 a ’
. game—.at least——.—and lead the team

because I’m an upperclassman,”
Harris said. “They saw me score
last year when my average went

' from seven to 22. Now they expect
fine to hit 20 every game because
that’s my average.

“It could _be taken as a pressure,
but I don’t think of it that way. I
wouldn’t say it’s a problem, but it is
something I have to get accustomed
I can’t score 20 points every
I’d like to, but I
can’t——-nobody can. Ican shoot and

j I can score, but not every night like
if I’d like to.”

 

 

Tankerssplit States -‘

BY JIM GEFSKY

For the Pitt tankers. last
weekend was truly the best oftimes
and the worst of times. The worst
of times occurred Friday when Pitt
lost a heartbreaker to Ohio State.
58-55. The best of times came the
following day as the Panthers sank
Penn State. 85-28. “

Panther guard David Washington looks down court and sees tough
times ahead with a schedule that includes powerful Syracuse, Notre

Dame, Cincinnati and  in the weeks ahead.

Harris has been shooting well enough to bring his average to 22 points
‘per game, but the team hasn’t been playing well enough to win more
than three contests. Something’s wrong, and Harris is ready to do

something about it. .

“It’s getting about that time when someone has to take charge on the
court,” he said. “And I think it’s going to have to be me. It just has to

- happen, and I seem to be the guy for the job.

5‘We have a lot of young players on this team, and we’re going right
down the chute because‘ of a lot of silly mistakes. We had 37 turnovers at I
Villanova—and you don’t beat anybody if you give them the ball almost

40 times.”

Harris, though the ﬂashiest dresser on the team and a man who enjoys
getting out after sundown, doesn’t cotton much to the idea of taking

0V€I'.

‘ ‘But,” he said, “as much as I don’t like getting on people’s backs and
things like that, it has to be done. Someone has'~to take control, and it

looks like it has to be me.”

There have been recent aspersions cast upon Harris’ ability to prevent
-‘points, from the stands and in print. They liken him to a matador,
waving his opponent past him and to the basket.

“I can’t agree withthat, ” said Harris. ‘ ‘Not at all. I can play defense v
well enough or I wouldn’t be out there. Nobody stays in the lineup if they
don’t play defense, no matter how good they are on offense. I

‘ ‘If I have to dive for a ball, I’ll dive, ’ ’ he said. ‘ ‘I don’t think of myself

as a one-man team.”

The other Panthers look for -Larry to produce, but sophomore Wayne
Williams said he doesn’t think the team looks for Larry to do it all, all the

time. '

“It might ' seem that way,
sometimes,” Williams said. “But I
don’tthink it’s so. I A g

“In a close situation, we look to
Larry, because we feel he can do it.
We think he can make that one- or
t\Wo-point difference.”

Which means, they look to Larry
Harris for leadership, especially
when it counts. “We need a leader,
for sure,” said Williams, “But you
can’t just appoint one—it has to be
natural.” '

The natural man at whom to point
that ﬁnger on Pitt’s team is Harris,
the only starter not in his first year
of wearing blue and gold.

When will Pitt’s production be
more wins? ‘fWheii we pull it
together,” said Harris. Some say
that won’t be for a while, and hope
it’s before next season. Harris,’ the
apparent new leader, has higher

. hopes.

”I want to pull it together by
Saturday night.” he said. Maybe

- that's because he wants to sing all

the way

and placed one-two in the

123.95-113.20 victory over West
Virginia in its season opener last
Friday night in Trees Hall.

“It was only our first meet of the -

season,” Pitt coach Donna DeMari-
no said. “They hit very
consistently, considering it was the
first meet."

Pitt jumped out to an early edge
by sweeping the vault. the first
event of the evening. Carson

with a score of 8.50, followed by

tied for second. A
“Alison had excellent execution

DeMarino said. “It was an

" was no competition at all as Carson

scvcn an eleven swimming events.
including both the 400-yard free-

relays. Jerry DeMuro won three
individual events, including the
500- and 1000-yard free styles and
the 200-yard butterﬂy. Mark
Schunian also posted three wins.

‘ two coming in relays and thevother

being the 200-yard individual
medley. ‘Pitt finished one-two. in
the 200-yard breaststroke through

the efforts of Orlando Catinchi and .

Bill Clemnier.

The reason Pitt lost to the
Buckeyes by a scant margin for the
second consecutive year was that
the Panthers ran into’: what is
probably the best diving team in
the nation. led by former Olympic
diving coach Ron O'Brien. Pitt
diving coach Al Coffey was unable
to drive his squad to victory against
this world class competition, as Pitt
lost both the one- and three—meter
dives and left Columbus 
three-point losers. Fortunately.

. p the Buckeyes are a member of the

Big Ten conference;-Pitt will not
have to face them in the Easterns.

Returning to Trees Pool against
Penn State the following day, the
tankers reacquainted themselves
with both home surroundings and
victory. Pitt took eleven firsts and
seven seconds. and the margin of
victory would have been evenlarger
had the Panthers not been
disqualified incthe 400-yard free-
style relay. \

In men’s gymnastics, Pitt will
likely win the protest it lodged after
last Friday”s narrow 180.70-180.50
loss to Navy, according to Head

'5‘ ‘U Coach lg Perez.

I,‘

The action in question took place
after Pitt freshman Keith Wip-
perecht’s routine on the high bar.
Navy coach Bill Savering spoke to
Head Judge Kenneth Chieffo who

then met with the other three
judges. After the conference

Wipperecht’s score was lowered by

three-tenths of a point. The Pitt
protest is based on the illegality of a

coach inﬂuencing a judge’s deci-

sion.

Perez’s next move is to send the
letter of protest, signed by Judge
Chieffo, to Roger Council of Indiana
State in Terre Haute, Ind. Council
is head of the NCAA Gymnastics
Rules Committee and will meet with
his committee to see if Navy’s score
should be reduced by three-tenths
of a point——just enough to give Pitt
the win. Perez should know of the
committee’s decision sometime late
next week.

BY MARIA SCIULLO

The basketball roster lists him as
63". but from the way Nathan
"Sonny" Lewis hovers around the
hoop. opponents ﬁgure the 3”
should be a 9."

Sonny’s amazing leaping ability,

is well-known throughout the area,
despite previous injuries to his
foot. ankle and knee. In 1975, he
joined Pitt teammates Wayne
Williams and Kelvin Smith in
leading Schenley High School to
the Pennsylvania state champion-
ship. The following year, Lewis
and the Spartans survived a
teachers‘ strike and once again
qualiﬁed for the PIAA tournament.

Schenley has been «known for
years as the alma mater of such
outstanding players as Maurice
Lucas. Jeep Kelley and Ricky
Coleman. For a while, Sonny had
to face not only the pressure of
upholding the Spartan tradition.
but he was also forced to play in the
shadow of his brother. Jeep Kelley.

"Everyone expected me to be
great right away because I was
Jeep's little brother,” he said.

As it turned out. football. not
hoops. was Sonny’s first love.
“When I was a kid." he laughed,
‘‘I was a little football freak. We
couldn't play basketball, 'cause the
big guys were always on the courts.
In eighth grade, though, I hurt my
knee and had to have an operation.
That ended football."

In Pitt's recent loss to West
Virginia. it became apparent why
Lewis. also known as “Frog,” was
the Pennsylvania MVP in the

I Pittsburgh Roundball Classic.- ‘

United States MVP in the
Cleveland Classic, All—City. All-
State. All-American and All-

Everything last year. His 23 points, ,

and rebounds were capped by a
slam dunk which brought the
screaming crowd of 5,300 to its
feet.

“I was really psyched for that
game. The crowd helped, too.
'cause they can turn you on when
you're hoopin’," he explained.
“Like with the Roundball.
Everybody's with you, and they
want you to show off. When I'm up
for a game, I can shoot over
anybody. and nobody’s going to
stop me.“

The adjustment from high school
to college basketball isn't always
easy. The defenses are far more
complicated, the level of competi-
tion much higher, and Sonny’s
coach at Schenley, Spencer Wat-
kins, is no longer around. The man
whom Sonny calls “a great help in
my life” is now the head coach at
San Bernadino College in Cali-
fornia. -

Tim Grgurich, however, was
hardly a new face when coaches
and recruiters began officially

Recalled Lewis, “When Jeep was
in ninth grade. Gurg used to come
by and he’d get us tickets for
games. He’s a good coach and he
and Spence are a lot alike."
Assistant Coach Fran Webster
admits "We have high hopes for
Sonny. .He's a great shooter. but
what makes him stand out is his
extraordinary jumping ability.
He’s like David Thompson, and
with a 37-inch vertical jump, Sonny
will -get rebounds any other player
his height could never reach.”
The high-ﬂying guard offered
one reason for the Panthers’ dismal
record so far, “We just aren't
playing as ateam right now.
We've got the talent to run right
over teams. but we’re not together
yet. We're getting there, though.

and we’ll be smokin' by the end of _

the season."

With the likes of Cincinnati,
Notre Dame and Maryland yet to
be faced by Pitt, the sooner the
Panthers get their act together and
live up to Sonny Lewis’ expecta-

or he better. ” J
