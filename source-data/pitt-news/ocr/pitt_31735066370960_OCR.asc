The tedious task of

Votes am often won or lost due to the speak_ I really don t know anything about it, said senior Terry Madden.

“As a commuter, I really don’t care what goes on.”

Senior Nancy Doman shared Madden’s viewpoint. “I don’t really know
how to answer that,” she said, “because I really don’t know what they
do. I live off—campus, so I don’t see that much of what" goes on.”

Board member Karen Frost responded by turning to a definition of the
SGB in a manual. She quoted: “The role of the Student Government Board
is to represent the student body and their concerns. They are responsible
for allocating $300,000 annually. _

“I think we do a good job,” she added. “We recently attended a con-
ference for the American Association of University Students. Compared
to ours, all of theother student governments seemed like they belonged
in a high school. We’ve done a lot more than they have.”

Frost admitted that members of Pitt’s SGB are not necessarily chosen
by their qualiﬁcations: “All of the other schools had 15 to 20 people on
their boards. We only have eight, and they aren’t necessarily qualiﬁed.

I hate to say it, but the students are chosen for their popularity — like A cand,-deters "platform" should firmjy

how many posters they have up.” . - 1
Pete Petropoulis, also a board member, said he felt that the role of stu- represen ms or her stance an Important

PUblIc- “Trying to get the students involved is something that’ll go on forever,”
Petropoulis said. “It just depends on the students; some are really involved,
others aren’t.” He then pointed out to the student activities at a number
of other schools, such as Ohio State, as compared to Pitt.

“What more could we do?” Frost asked. “We take care of everything
that is brought to us — everything that we know about. We got involved
in apartheid, for example. I just can’t think of any more that we can do.”

Petropoulis agreed, saying that, once again, it is up to the students to
make the student government work: “People brought us complaints about
the freshmen not having housing. I talked to the administrators and did’
everything that I could. But when I tried to talk to students about the pro-
blem, they didn’t really care.”

“We’ve worked on problems, like with the teaching assistants, and lit-
tle things that people don’t hear about,” Frost continued. “About hous-
ing, if we don’t have students behind us on the issues, then the administra-
tion knows that, and there’s not much we can do.” _

Board member Micheal Ryan agreed with Frost that the SGB was do~
ing a good job: “We’ve worked on a lot of touchy issues this year. We
didn’t run into a lame-duck period in the fall like a lot of other student
governments do.” Ryan explained that a “lame duck” period was one
in which those on the board are elected before summer break and then
return in the fall as seniors and no longer are concerned with any issues , .  
from the previous year. He added that a number of the problems the cur- -'  , ' * ' _

South African government bars all media from violence

PRETORIA, South Africa —— The
South African government has barred
television crews, photographers and
radio reporters from covering any in-
cidents of violent unrest in black
townships as President Botha continues
to accuse foreign reporters of being
“grossly and even criminally unfair”
in their coverage of political violence
in that country. Journalists accused of
violating the new order face up to 10
years in prison and a $7,000 ﬁne. Ac-
cording to the decree, all journalists
must be accompanied by a police escort
when covering any serious conﬂicts be-
tween police and black citizens. The
South African acts of censorship have
come under swift international criticism
from the United States and England.
Anti-apartheid leader Sheena Duncan
claimed the government ban will give
“unlimited license to the security
forces to abuse their already extensive
powers.”

Heart recipients
grow stronger

Pennsylvania — The state’s two heart
transplant patients continue to improve
this weekend. A spokesman for the

‘Hershey medical center said Anthony

Mandia of Philadelphia remains in
critical but stable condition despite
some kidney and pancreas problems.

Doctors stated that Mandia shows no
signs of rejecting his transplanted
human heart, which is the most com-
mon and dangerous event heart
transplant patients face after an opera-
tion. In Pittsburgh, Thomas Gaidosh
meanwhile continues his recovery at
Presbyterian-University hospital.
Gaidosh remains in serious condition.

Tests continue
on space shuttle

CAPE CANAVERAL Ex-
periments on board the space shuttle
Challenger continue despite a com-
munications problem which caused a
four-hour delay for a call from the
Dutch vice-rninister. The communica-
tions delay was caused by a small ﬁre
in the power supply of two computer
systems at a tracking station in New
Mexico.

The experiments include new
research in crystal growth sciences,
which are ‘being carried out in the
European~built space-lab module in the
ship’s payload. The record eight-
member crew reports making solid pro-
gress in their experiments, all accord-
ing to plans.

The week-long space shuttle mission
passed the half-way mark yesterday,
and is scheduled to land at California’s
Edwards Air Force Base on
Wednesday.

Guatemala
holds election

GUATEMALA CITY —~ A
69—member team of international
observers monitored Guatemala’s na-
tional balloting in that country’s first
civilian election in 30 years yesterday.
The elections are expected to end the
military rule of that country which
began with a CIA-sponsored military
takeover in 1954. Since that time,
Guatemala has been ruled by a series
of military governments. The current
elections will bring a president, vice-
president, a 100-seat national assembly
and local mayors into office. Despite

the military’s reticence in allowing the
elections to take place, military leaders
have warned that if results are not to
their liking they will remain a force to
be reckoned with in the ensuing
political power shifts.

Peace accord
left unsigned

BEIRUT -— A Syrian-sponsored
Lebanese peace accord was not signed
as planned in Beirut yesterday morn-
ing. The ceremony was postponed to
allow more consultations between
various parties in the accord in an at-

tempt to ensure the pact will truly end
the 10-year-old civil war. Meanwhile,
Beirut radio reports that a girl riding
a bomb-laden donkey was fired upon
by South Lebanon Army soldiers after
refusing to halt as she approached one
of their outposts near the Israeli border.
The Israeli—backed militia reported that
only the girl was hurt in the incident
which occured just outside the Israeli
security zone.

Reagan has authorized the CIA to con-
duct a covert operation against Lybian
leader Colonel Moammar Khadafy.
The newspaper said that the operation
is designed to disrupt and frustrate
Khadafy‘s support of and involvement
with terrorism and subversion,
although what terrorism and subversion
is not exactly clear. The Post also said
that a narrow majority of members of
the House and Senate intelligence com-
mittees support the presidential action.

S Commission asked

to reject increase

HARRISBURG — Four consumer

groups are currently asking the state
Public Utility Commission to reject the
Philadelphia Electric Company’s pro-
posal to increase rates by $671 million
overall. The utility is seeking the 29.6
percent increase to recover the costs of
its $3.8 billion Limerick nuclear power
plant in Montgomery County. The
plant began operating in August. The
consumer groups contend that the in-
crease would be a staggering blow to
Philadelphia residents who are already
paying more than anyone else in the
state for their electricity.

Max Weiner, a spokesman for the

consumer education and protective
association, said “consumers were sold
a bill of goods at the beginning of the
nuclear age.” He said every new plant
causes rates to skyrocket. -

Otherﬂgroups opposing the rate in-

crease in the action ﬁled last Thursday

include the Action Alliance of Senior
Citizens, the Association of Communi-

ty Organizations for Reform Now and

Philadelphia Citizens in Action.

Reagan approves
missile reduction

WASHINGTON — In his weekly
radio address yesterday, President
Reagan announced his approval of the
Soviet proposal to reduce offensive
missiles by 50 percent, but said there
are still signiﬁcant ﬂaws in the Soviet
proposal. The New York Times reports
that the recently submitted American
proposal will eliminate plans for the
deployment of mobile land-based

nuclear missiles. Under the proposal,
the Soviets would have to abandon their
mobile SS-24 and SS-25 missiles in
return for the United States abandon-
ing its development of the Midgetman
mobile missile.

French agents

PARIS — Two French secret service
agents _accused of sinking the
Greenpeace ‘Rainbow Warrior’ will be
facing charges in a New Zealand court
today. The court judge will decide
whether they should be put on trial for
murder and arson for carrying out the
actof-sabotage last month. The hear-
ing is expected to last up to three
weeks. ‘

By Michael Adebimpe
For The Pitt News

The College Republicans of the
University of Pittsburgh are currently
re—organizing their group on campus.

In a telephone interview with Tony
DeFiore, the president of the organiza-
tion, he declared that the purpose of the
reorganization of Pitt Republicans is
“to communicate the idea of what’s go-
ing on in the Republican party to Pitt
students. We intend to increase the
number of active and interested
students of the Republican party here
at the University of Pittsburgh.”

Lynn Fischer, a senior at Pitt and an

active member of Pitt Republicans,_

analyzed the major objective behind
this organization. “We want to get the
party known in the Pitt political
climate,” she said. “We would like to
invite great political speakers to Pitt to

Fischer, a member of the presiden-
tial task force, said she believed that
the Pitt Republicans can make a dif-
ference in the upcoming 1986
senatorial elections. “I think we can
make a-difference," she said. “We
want to use our resources to maintain
the Republican majority in the Senate."

Fischer said she believes in “free
trade and enterprise, strong defense.
and reduction of the deficit but not in
too many social programs."

“We are trying to attract conser-
vative students who want to become in-
volved in politics and socialize with the
Pitt Republican students," she con-
tinued. “We are Reaganites who want
conservatism to grow and last, and we
don’t want 1988 to be the end of con-
servatism. ”

. “President Reagan is doing a terrific
job," she added. “His re—election to

 

 

the Oval Office in the 1984 presiden-

tial election is living proof of this."

In addition to her effort of getting
Republicans organized at Pitt, Fischer
promised to get in touch with the head
of Pennsylvania College Republicans
in Harrisburg to get full support for the
Pitt Republicans organization.

The 1988 elections are not far away,
and the organization plans to help
return a Republican president to the
White House. Fischer predicted that in
1988, Vice President George Bush is

going to get nominated as the party’s '

presidential candidate, and she said she
believes Bush is going to win.
Therefore, Fischer said, it's time for
the Pitt Republicans to start the
‘ ‘grassroot campaign” for the success

of the ‘Republican candidates for all the _

upcoming elections.

Endorsements

On Nov. 6 and 7, students at the University of Pitts-

burgh will be electing new ofﬁcers to positions on the
Student Government Board. In order to acquaint

ourselves with the individual candidates. the editorial
staff of The Pitt News conducted interviews in which

we attempted to assess which candidates were the most
qualiﬁed. On the basis of what was discerned of in-
dividual merit and ability in these interviews, we make «
the following endorsements.

Letters to the Editor  

For the position of Student Government Board presi-

dent, we endorse Dan Taylor. In his interview, Taylor
evinced a clear understanding of the workings of the
Student Government Board; an awareness of the limita-
tions constraining the Board and an intimate knowledge
of the relationships between relevant organizations,
committees, and persons. His past record shows him
to be diligent in his efforts to promote student interests.
For instance, Taylor has been active in seeking resolu-
tions to both the language problem confronting some
foreign teaching assistants and the need for a 24,-hour
campus facility for study. '

Melanie Naro, candidate for the SGB, displayed great

intensity and vigor in her concern for issues affecting
students. Her first priority is to secure a 24-hour study
area. Naro’s enthusiasm would serve students well on
the Student Government Board.

Addressing the campus housing problem is candidate

«Monique Sims’ first concern. Sims exhibited a thorough
knowledge of the problems facing Pitt students and gave
evidence that she has formulated tentative approaches
toward resolving these problems.

Finally, we endorse Jay Rothstein. Rothstein’s

primary concern is the improvement of communications

between students and the SGB. His ﬁery commitment
to the promotion of student interests makes him highly
desirable as a board member.

We urge students to use their votes wisely. By install-
ing the right persons in these positions, we increase the
likelihood that the SGB will function as an efﬁcacious
vehicle in university politics.

‘boldens those who fall

Right Values

The letter to the editor by Doug Ben-
nett, in the Oct. 23, 1985 issue of The
Pitt News poses an interesting and most
valid inquiry.

He begins with the standard
disclaimer (“while I do not support
apartheid in any form  then pro-
ceeds to question whether those in-
dividuals “so vehemently against
[apartheid] would be so to the detriment
of their own self-interest” (i. e., would
they take Kruggerands if offered;
would they pay higher tuition rates to
support divestment, etc.). ,

I also wonder, although my query is
not directed to those who are protesting
apartheid through their actions. My
question is: When are we students go-
ing to discard the image of the “me”
generation trying desperately to achieve
material success and political oblivion?

You’re right, Mr. Bennett, the issue
has been brought to a personal level,
but the answers are indeed cut and dry.
When are we going to uphold our
moral and ethical responsibilities to not
only the human race but also to
ourselves? Do we have the courage to
become the generation that makes deci-

sions based not on short-sighted, per-

sonal self-interest but instead on what
we know to be right?

Mr. Bennett is correct when he em-
into his
aforementioned categories to re-
examine their positions, and I offer a
personal challenge to them to justify
their position to support apartheid (Yes,
and I do mean support it; after all, if
one is not part of the solution, then one

happened to you or something you saw
that affected you, even if it’s only read
by yourself, your friend or your
lover — has a special meaning and im-
portance all its own. It may seem in-
significant today, but over time, all you
write down is important not just as a
history of your life but for what it says
about all our lives.

Some people are “too intelligent” to
read the Reader’s Digest, or they don’t
consider newspaper columnists’ work
to be true literature. But one thing all
literature has in common is the beauty
in the glimpses of peoples’ lives that
it can capture — something we all can
capture.

Newspaper articles are usually sim-
ple and descriptive, but when you take
all the stories that we read about over
the weeks, we can see in the
newspapers all the life of a story by
John Gardner or Virginia Woolf. Gard-
ner and Woolf used their craft to make
their descriptive works beautiful
literature, but even The Pitt News you
hold in your hand tells a lot about our
lives and our culture. When I read The
Pitt News, I speciﬁcally do not want
it to sound like a slick, polished, pro-
fessional newscast. The greatest value
of its writing is in seeing peoples’ per-
sonality (humor, anger) and humarmess
come through.

CGS’s The Night Times, also
authored by students, is another great
paper for this. But my favorite exam-
ple of simple writing having important
meaning is The Post Gazette ’s “Our
Towne by Joe Browne.”

Ever since I was little, Joe Browne
has never written anything but simple,
kind-hearted stories of Pittsburghers’
lives, and he has been a treasure for 20
years. The gift of his work has been

It doesn’t matter that you don’t sound
as clever or ‘ ‘literary” as some writer.
What matters is what you see, what you
feel. I may not ever write the great
American novel, but that’s all right.

maybe even more importantly, as
weeks and months go on, you have

Project P.U.S.H.

I usually consider what I read in The
Pitt News to be nothing short of gospel,
but I must point out a glaring untruth
that reared its ugly head in the Oct. 28
article about the Sigma Chi Fraternity
Derby Days Charity event.

Sigma Chi’s assistant chairman of
this project, Mac Gordon, boastfully
claims in the article that, “Sigma Chi
is the only fraternity that raises money
for charity outside of Greek Week.”
Sorry, fellas, but this claim is nothing
short of totally false.

.Project P.U.S.H. (Play Units for the
Severely Handicapped) is the Pi Kap-
pa Phi Fraternity’s national charitable
endeavor. The unenlightened Mr. Gor-
don can read all about P.U.S.H. on
page six of the Oct. 18 issue (“Pitt
Greeks sponsor wheelchair Push-A-
Thon to raise money’ ’). [Pi Kappa Phi
“pushed into Pitt Stadium before the
Pitt-Syracuse game on Saturday.”]

pa Phi brother and Project P.U.S.H.
chairman) informed me that P.U.S.H.

From Under My Desk/Dan Bates

Hitting the Campaign Trail: A Likely Candidate

So it ’s Student Government Board
elections time already, and I seem to
have missed the entire campaign trail.
The speeches, the campaign dinners
and the kissing of babies has gone
almost completely unnoticed. I
recognize the candidates only by their
names and the color of their posters
which have been so skillfully placed
around campus. Who are these people,
anyway?

The other day,‘ a friend told me she
can tell that a person is very important
if his desk is messy and full of papers.
I fully understood because, at that time,
I couldn’t even locate my desk beneath
the stacks of unopened mail, the ac-
cumulated messages and the crumpled
press releases.

Yes, I guess I am important ——- judg-
ing from my desk, at least. You know,
maybe I should have run for an SGB
position. I mean, after all, I am impor-

Washington
Head Start:

They met at a hotel not far from the
airport. They had the usual seminars
and workshops, and manufacturers
came to display their products. They
had a gala and gave away door prizes,
and then they all went home. I am talk-
ing about regional workers in Head
Start, the Great Society program, 20
years old and still a roaring success.
Hush, it’s a secret. ‘

You did not know that Head Start
was thriving? Well, neither did I. You
did not know that here was one brain-
child of 1960s’ liberalism that had not
been pronounced a well-intentional but
dismal failure and therefore was
starved by the Reagan administration?
Don’t blame yourself. When itcomes
to Head Start, its success, even its very
existence, it’s.something of a secret.
Who knows, if more people knew
about it they might start getting ideas.

  
   

tant. Just look at my desk if there is any
doubt. I might have made a ﬁne can-
didate, and people would assuredly
know who I am.

I would probably begin my campaign
with a widely publicized fund-raising
dinner to pay for my eye-catching
posters. I would serve pizza and beer,
and I would charge $6 per person. I
would then hire the Pitt band to enter-
tain us. This may not win me the elec-
tion, but it certainly would be fun.

And speaking of posters, I would
have my picture on'them so people
would recognize me on the street, stop
me and say, “Hey, aren’t you the guy
who sponsored the wild bash?” I would
probably have my picture taken in front
of a big tree because it would surely
be symbolic of something patriotic and
American.

Also, campaign posters are useless
without a real catchy slogan, and it just

so happens that my last name is perfect
for this campaign cuteness. How about
this one: “Take the bait — Vote for
Bates.” This is even better: “Vote for
Dan Bates and get the whole can of
worms." I suppose I was just born
lucky.

As the campaign progresses, I would
begin to stand ﬁrmly on my campaign
platform. After all, a candidate must
have a solid platform before he can run
for ofﬁce. So I would merely take a bus
downtown to the Diamond Market and
ﬁnd a wooden vegetable crate in their
trash. The crate wouldn’t exactly be a
soap box, but it would be just as handy.

Most important, however, my plat-
form will last even after the election.
I will take it home and probably put
records in it or something. This is a bit
unusual, I admit, but maybe the long-
lasting platform will become a political
trend in the future.

When the time comes that I must
give a campaign speech, I will be
ready. I am in the midst of a ﬁne public
speaking class which, I can assure you,
will make me capable of almost
anything. With the dynamics of Jesse
Jackson and the charm. of Ronald
Reagan, I will capture the hearts of the
students and, with a little persuasion,
I may get a few votes. My speech
would go something like this:

“Fellow students, I am here today,

representing the views of the students -

— your views. I admit, I really don’t
know what your views are and prob-

- ably never will, but it sounds good.

Yes, indeed, it sounds good," I would
say. I

“I am ready to accomplish the tasks
of an SGB member because, well, I’ve
ridden the bus. This gives me a
nnticeahlginsight into the lifeof a com-

muter. And I was once in one of the
dorm rooms in the Towers, so Iican
fully relate to campus life. Most im-
portantly, I have shaken hands with

President Posvar, so I have keen con— '

nections. I am ready, I say! Yes, peo-
ple, I am ready to take on the world!
And besides, despite my crooked
smile, I really am a nice guy  real-
ly.“ The audience will love me.

However, I see one problem in win-
ning the election. My victory may be
such an ego boost for me that I would
probably want to run for mayor and
then governor. Maybe I could even be
president of the United States because,

well, despite my crooked smile, I really’

am a nice guy.
But before I take on the Student

Government Board and the world, I .

must tackle the problem at hand. Has
anyone seen my desk?

Working for the Poor In Spite of Low Funding  

At the moment, though, there is lit-'
tle fear of that. The prevailing wisdom
is that there is almost nothing the big
bad federal government can do but gum
up the works —- make poor people
poorer and dependent by subsidizing a
welfare culture that has persisted for
generations.

Head Start proclaims otherwise —
not that anyone much pays attention.
Its little secret remains largely ignored
as the nation coasts blithely into a social
and economic crisis that everyone can
see coming, but few, least of all the ad-
ministration, are doing anything to
avoid. In report after report, both Con-
gress and private agencies proclaim the

‘ worsening plight of the black child if

only because so many of them (4.3
million) live in poverty. Their statistical
proﬁle is shocking. -

that a black child is twice as likely as
a white child to die in the ﬁrst year of
life, three times as likely to be poor,
four times as likely to be on welfare.

‘Congressional reports paint the same

picture. They say that compared to a
white child, a black child is 12 times

‘ more likely to have a never-married

mother, two-and—a-half times as likely
to have a separated or divorced mother
and three-and-a-half times as likely to
have a widowed mother. A recent
report says that 50 percent of -all black
children are in female-headed
households; and in‘ some inner—city
ghettoes three quarters of all children
are born to single mothers.’

The sum of all these numbers is, of
course, social chaos — and just plain
personal misery. You can ignore the
misery if you want but not the social
chaos. It’s dangerous and expensive —

as dangerous and expensive as crime,
welfare, unemployment, alcoholism,
drug addiction and the ﬁre that is surely
coming next time. And yet, at the level
that really matters, social services are
or have been cut back in the name of
either economics or ideology. The
Head Start people at this conference,
although relieved their own programs
are safe, say that all the other social
service programs they rely on (health
and nutrition, for example) have either
been reduced or priced so high they are
outof reach.

In 20 years such programs as Head
Start, directed precisely at the children
who comprise the statistics in all those
reports, have proven their worth. By
getting to the kids at an early age, one
long-range study shows, the programs
have produced adults who have lower
rates of teenage pregnancy, crime and

welfare dependency and higher rates of
employment. The programs have made
a difference. Yet Head Start has the
funds to serve only maybe a third of
the children it could. _

Recently, the Reagan administration
has struck a more activist pose, even.
if it had no choice. After years of
dawdling it finally took substantive ac-
tion regarding South African economic
sanctions. Similarly, after waiting for
the ghost of Adam Smith to rectify the
trade imbalance, the adminstration
moved to bring down the value of the
dollar.

If it could intervene in these matters,

and by doing so tacitly acknowlege its f
previous mistakes, why could it not _

also intervene in the lives of the poor?.
There were several hundred ‘people
meeting here who know just how it

could be done. They would be glad to

share their secret. 4

Page 6 ' The Pitt News,‘ November 4, 1985

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

In an address to the Colloquium on
Security Thursday evening, Dr.
Michael Hudson, director of the Center
for Contemporary Arab Studies at
Georgetown University, discussed
reasons for the current problems in the
Middle, East and then suggested several
changes in U.S. policy regarding that
region.

According to Hudson, three main
factors are provoking the current in-
stability in the Middle East. The first
‘of these is the termination of the oil
boom. Sharp decreases in oil prices,
the professor said, have disrupted the
economies of many Arab nations,
bringing about a certain degree of
unrest among the lower socio-
economic echelons.

Islamic resurgence, Hudson
believes, has also played a critical role.

“Iranian Fundamentalists performed
the most important deed in the Middle
East in the last generation when they
overthrew the Shah,” he remarked,
citing the work of a popular historian.
“Islamic Fundamentalism,“ Hudson
continued, “represents a new and
powerful wave of identities which are
challenging other long-held identities.”

The professor, though, said the chief
reason for the present Middle Eastern
instability pertains to “the stagnation
of the Arab-Israeli peace process. ‘I am
convinced,” he told The Pitt News
“that the Arab-Israeli conﬂict is the
most devastating one out there.”

Hudson said he sees Palestinian
absence from Middle Eastern peace
talks as a major stumbling block. He
criticized the Reagan administration for
its refusal to deal with the Palestinian
Liberation Organization.

‘ ‘We should at least be talking to the
PLO instead of humiliating their pre-

sent leadership,” he told The Pitt
News. “We need to turn our Palestin-
ian policy around [by] 180 degrees.
Palestinian representatives should be
recognized as such and engaged in
some sort of diplomatic process.”
Moreover, Hudson supports the
creation of a Palestinian state on the
West Bank, claiming that “this might
be the best way to end the conﬂict
[which has been] going on since the
Balfour Declaration.” He noted,
however, that in dealing with the PLO,
one must remember “that while it has
been inching toward a peace-loving’
posture, it has been pursuing ter-
rorism.” '
Hudson made several other sugges-
tions pertaining to U.S. Middle Eastern
policy. He cautioned the president
against humiliating allies in the region,
most notably Egypt. “Egyptian leader-
ship feels it’s been betrayed,” he said.
Furthermore, he urged the president

to refrain from using military force to
combat terrorism unless “the U.S.
government knew for sure who did it. ”

“Misguided aggression,” Hudson
told The Pitt News, “could only en-
courage more terrorism against the
United States. What’s more,” he
remarked, “many American pro-
fessors, students and businessmen are
in danger every time we [the U.S.
government] decide to seek
vengeance.” _

Hudson also discussed Russian
presence in the Middle East. The
Soviets, he said, are by no means well-
liked by a large part of the Arab world,
“but they are basically sympathetic to
the Arab cause.

“Things are looking up for the
Soviets  while American inﬂuence
is declining,” Hudson stated in his in-
terview. “I was persuaded by the
Soviets’ long-term conﬁdence in the
Middle East.”

 Pitt prepares

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

According to Pitt officials, the first
phase of Pitt’s Campus of the Future
will arrive on campus in December,
when a new sophisticated phone system
will replace many of Pitt’s 11,000
telephones.

The announcement was made when
the university and AT&T unveiled the
results of a cooperative venture that
will make Pitt the ﬁrst university in the
world to have a three-tier information
system based on ﬁber-optic technology.

"‘It’s a reality just 22 months after
we started,’-’ said President Wesley

Posvar. “AT&T has given us the op-
portunity to become the prototype of
a new kind of campus. The implica-
tions are vast.

The new information system will be

’ able to transmit simultaneously voice

(telephone), data (computer) and video
(television) communications through-
out the campus, due to the installation
of 350 miles of ﬁber-optic cables.

The first component of the system
gives Pitt its own phone company,
based on a sophisticated Private Branch
Exchange . Pitt’s current four-digit on-
campus telephone dialing system will
be replaced by a five-digit system, and
new numbers for students living in the
dorms will be distributed when the

phones are replaced during the term
break in December.

The new touch-tone phones will have
a call-waiting feature and a new ring-
ing system. The call-waiting will
enable students to receive one caller
while talking with another. Pitt officials
say this feature should do away with
busy signals, thus increasing com-
munication on campus.

The new ringing system on the
phones will designate whether the in-
coming call is from off-campus or
within the Pitt system.

Also, long-distance rates for students 0

will be reduced because of the new
phone system. Students will have to
pay no more for the PBX phones than
they pay under the current system.

Pitt’s new phones will be unique

"because calls will be transmitted on a

network also carrying data and video
information.

‘ ‘Other universities, of course, have
communication systems that combine
voice and data,” said Fred Gage, Pitt’s
associate director of the Campus of the

‘Future. “What is unique about the

Pittsburgh network is the triple capacity
of voice, data and video. This has been
accomplished through a ‘ prototype
video capability that AT&T and the
university are now evaluating.”
Computer data is distributed through
AT&T’s recent innovation, the Infor-
mation Systems Network. With the
ISN, students never have to wait in
long lines at a particular Computer Ac-

 

cess Site, as they did under the old
system. Students at any CAS can talk
to any computer on the ISN at the
university. With authorization, students
may access ISN information from off-
campus or even out of town by
telephone.

The Campus of the Future will also i

be able to transmit video directly into
the classroom. Initially, 21 classrooms,
lecture halls and seminar suites will be
able to watch from existing video
resources at the touch of a button.
Within several years, 120 classrooms
will have this capability.

Professors will be able to tape a lec-
ture and store it at the university’s
video center for later playback by

Y ippie —- an exclusive interview with Abbie Hoffma

By Bob Travers
Staff Writer

‘ ‘The reasonable man adapts himself
to the world; the unreasonable one per-
sists in trying to adapt the world to
himself. Yherefore all progress depends
on the unreasonable man. "

— George Bernard Slzaw

The shaggy brown hair and unkept
beard that hung over Abbie Hoffman’s
-face during his heyday in the 1960s is
a little thinner and a little grayer now.
And the 42 arrests, 7 years of life on
the run as a fugitive from the law, and
time spent in prison in the early 1980s
have all taken their toll on Hoffman’s
face.

The face — the round intense eyes
and prominent nose that helped inspire
a generation — now has more lines than
the New Jersey turnpike. But that’s to
be expected: America’s favorite hippie
will be 50—years-old in just over a
year.Abbie Hoffman will be at Pitt this
Thursday as part of the v“Yippie vs.
Yuppie” debate sponsored by the Pitt
Program Council. Hoffman is the Yip-
pie. His one-time friend and comrade-
in-protest Jerry Rubin is the Yuppie.

Back in the 1960s Hoffman and
Rubin were no.’s 1 and 2 on the Hit
Parade of counterculture heroes. Hoff-
man and Rubin organized the Youth In-
ternational Party — acronym YIP, later
Yippie. Hoffman and Rubin par-
ticipated in sit-ins at Berkley, took over
buildings at Columbia and caused many

of the often violent protests at the 1968
Democratic Convention in Chicago.
For this last action, Hoffman and Rubin
were brought to trial as part of the
notorious Chicago seven, indicted for
conspiracy and crossing state lines to
incite a riot. The seven were later
cleared on a technicality.

Hoffman and Rubin —- It would
always be this way, or so it seemed.

pair as they reached the age of the
Material Girl and Volvos. Hoffman
and Rubin no longer shared the vision
of a better society. In fact they no
longer shared much of anything.
“Jerry and I don’t travel in the same
circles,” Hoffman said in an exclusive
interview with The Pitt News. “I live
in a small town on the St. Lawrence
River while Jerry lives on the Upper
East Side of Manhatten. We don’t go
out for drinks or anything like that.”

There was a time, not long ago,
when college students in America had
more on their minds than their
American Express Application form,
and they thought they could change the
world. Abbie Hoffman was one of the
people who told them they could.

It was a journey through the land of
Dixie that sent Hoffman on his road to
social protest. “Travelling through
Georgia and Mississippi in the early
’60s is what started me,” he said. “The
reality of ‘Whites Only’ contrasted with
what the mythology of America is, of
what I learned in my high school and
even college civics courses, and to a
certain extent what religion and my
parents taught me it was. I-felt cheated
in my education that they hadn’t taught
me everything.”

“The '60s movements didn’t start
with the Viet Nam war,” he said.
“They started with the civil rights
movement, the sense of moral outrage
in the South.”

Linking the past with today, Hoff-
man says the Apartheid issue could
become what civil rights was for the
1960s.

the technology they’ve implemented to
help them better represent the students,
such as the computer which provides
them with a hookup to other schools.

“A lot of schools have the same type
of problems we have. The computer
lets us work on the problems
together,” Ryan said.

Ryan and Frost pointed to the work
of President Luke Kluchko as having
strengthened the group: “Luke helped
to get the administration and the SGB
to work together, instead of being
against each other. As soon as he got
elected, he went around and got to
know them and helped us get to know
them.

“Now when we have a problem with
something, we feel comfortable talk-
ing to those in charge,” added Frost.

“When you’re elected to SGB, doors

open up," Ryan said, summing up his
role as a board member. “Your work
has to go above and beyond to make
it good. You could just get elected and
do an adequate amount of work, and
you’d get by. But we have to do
more."

According to Andrew Smith, Direc-
tor of Student Activities, the role of the
student government is three-fold:
“There are several roles of the SGB,
the most structured of which is the
allocations of the Student Activities fee.
This is a major role of the student
government.

“A second role of SGB is for the
specific issue of representing the in-
terests of the students," he continued.
“They do this either by appointing peo-
ple or by serving as representatives on
various committees. A third role is to
involve themselves with the concerns
of the students. They listen to the
students and address themselves to
those concerns.”

Smith went on to evaluate each of the
three roles in accordance with how well
Pitt’s SGB carries them out. “The best
job is in the allocations department,”
he said. “The next strongest area is in
representing the students’ interests.

students. Other advantages of the
system will include specially created
video disks and live remotes. The live
coverage might include surgical opera-
tions or lab demonstrations.

Video information will also be used
throughout the campus to help students
learn useful information. Video infor-
mation kiosks (booths). will be located
at convenient sites where students,
faculty and visitors can find a calender
of Pitt activities, maps of the campus,

Other advantages of the Campus of

the Future will include electronic cam-
pus mail, video bulletin boards and ac-
cess to automated card catalogues in
Pitt’s 18 libraries.

“The Campus of the Future clearly
transcends a telephone system or a
computer system,” said Posvar. The
first phase of the new system will cost
less than Pitt pays for the current one.

He added, “The value of the project ,

to the university over the next few
years in terms of cost reductions, pro-
ductivity increases, improved services
and academic opportunities will far ex-

ceed the costs of the system.”

They've taken a look at such issues as
apartheid, so I‘d have to give them a
good mark in that area."

Smith said he felt there was one area
that could use some improvement —
the one involving the issue of student
participation. “Their one problem is
getting representatives for committees
to serve and to go to meetings." Smith
added that it was the student popula-
tion as a whole that has to improve this
one ﬂaw. ‘

“I’ve been here for six years , and
I‘ve seen the student government
become very sophisticated,” Smith

But if he were a student leader to-
day, Hoffman says he would go about
motivating people to action in an en-
tirely‘ different way. “If I were to
organize a movement today, I wouldn't
start with young people because there
is no counterculture today. There is no
reason to.appeal to youth as being dif-
ferent from the general population. I
could not build a political base today
based on sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll.“

But at one time he could, and did.
At the height of his popularity, Hoff-
man was portrayed as the establish-
ment’s alter-ego, the eyes and mouth
of a restless youth. He was regarded
as a media genius and expert
shtickmeister for such stunts as running
a pig for President of the United States
and throwing money onto the ﬂoor of
the New York Stock Exchange.

Today, Hoffman is quick to point out
that not everybody in the 1960s was so
radical. “-What you have to remember
is that student life has traditionally been
very conservative. The ’60s were a
ﬂuke. The majority of students were
not involved with the protests. In a poll
taken in 1968, which is probably
thought of as the year the whole move-
ment was at its peak, Richard Nixon

said. “They're discussing things in '
public now which are not very easy to
discuss. They’ve tried to be effective.
This does not necessarily mean that
they‘ve had to be loud and bombastic
in order to get anything accom-
plished.”

Smith said he felt the student govem-
ment has done its best to try to active-
ly recruit students to become involved
and to try to represent the students the
best way possible.

Robert Gallagher, director of
counseling. had a more difficult time
defining the SGB’s role. “The student

government is a representative group 
of the student body,” he said. “I think — ,
their effectiveness varies from year to Q 4

year. Sometimes they’re very involved,

and some years there's just not as much . L ‘-
going on. Gallagher said that last year

seemed fairly quiet. probably due to the

fact that there simply weren’t as many ‘ V

issues to work on.

“I’ve been around here so many"
years that one group just seems to run
into another," said Gallagher, who has
been at Pitt since 1967. “As a whole,
I think they’re very responsible and
hard-working. " i

and John Wayne were the two most
popular men on campus."

To underscore his point he added,“It
was never our generation that did
everything, but a few leaders who
cared enough to do something.“

One of the reasons for the fading
away of the 1960s counterculture was
its insistence on youth, evidenced by
the rallying cry “Never Trust Anybody
Over 30." As the protesters got older
and eventually reached 30 years of age,
nobody younger took their place. '

“I believed in the ‘never trust anyone
over 30’ ideal because I was a partici-
pant in the using of the counterculture.
We subscribed to generational revolt, ”
Hoffman said. “We knew we couldn't
get Archie Bunker so we went after Ar-
chie Bunker’s kids.”

But with the passing of Archie into
syndication, and era had passed, and
Hoffman could sense it. “I went
through a period where I didn’t trust
anyone under 30. In all the en-
vironmental projects I am involved
with I don’t think there is a leader
under the age of 35.”

Looking at the scene on campus to-
day, Hoffman said he thinks students
may be awakening with a new spirit of
justice and idealism. “In the last eight

months I have seen a dramatic shift in
student activism. Thousands have been
arrested in events protesting apartheid,
and hundreds of thousands
demonstrated against apartheid on Oct.
1 1. Students have forced 68 schools to
divest."

Hoffman also said that, when faced
with an issue, today’s young people

will respond. ‘‘If there is another war .

or another draft, young people today

are going to respond with even more I V.

fury then we did in the sixties.”

Is that the ultimate legacy of the six-
ties — young people knowing that
something can be done in the face of
institutional injustice? Hoffman

answered that it was not just the young

who beneﬁtted.

“All people who are active today are
inﬂuenced by the ’60s, knowing that
authority can be challenged successful-
ly. Little people, poor people know
they can win the lottery, but_ that’s
bullshit. They don't think they can win
against Philadelphia Electric, against
banks, against DOW Chemical. I know
they can win," Hoffman said. ‘

Robert Ardizzi
Ardizzi’s platform in running for SGB is to
make the board more directly representative of
students’ needs. To best serve the students’
needs, he said he would like to begin by lower-
ing university parking costs for commuters. He
said he would then like to initiate improvement
of off-campus housing. He statde that he would
also like movement on currently tabled issues
that affect students. Ardizzi said he has the ex-
perience and ability to be a responsible board

Andy Bacallao

Student Government Board candidate Andy
Bacallao said he sees persistence as the key to
success.

“With much persistence, I would definitely
try to act collectively on behalf of the student
body," Bacallao said.

Bacallao, 19, said his main goal is to stress
the real needs of the students to the faculty and
administration, not the other way around.

The willingness to listen to people is also one
of Bacallao's assets, he said. He added that he
has a very positive outlook on things, which.
he said, is very important for an SGB member.

Bacallao, a sophomore from Horsham, Pa.,
said he would like to see some safety measures
taken to protect students along both Fifth and
Forbes Avenues. He suggested that a slow
speed zone be strictly enforcedto discourage

He said he would also like to address the pro-
blems of student housing and apathy. “I would
like to better inform students of current issues
on campus. Apathy shouldn’t be given up as
a standard,” he said.

Glenn Cooper

Student Government Board candidate Glenn
Cooper said the lack of student involvement on
campus is something that must quickly be ad-
dressed 'by the SGB.

“It seems that so many people are just here.
They go to class, study, and don’t do anything
else,” Cooper said.

As a member of the SGB, Cooper said he
would, if elected, stir up more enthusiasm in
students and try to curb the general apathy. He
suggested’ that the SGB begin by keeping
students informed about SGB activities in the
form of periodic newsletters.

Cooper’s concern stems from the recent
Homecoming Week which he said highlighted
the apathy of students on campus.

Cooper, 20, is a junior from Philadelphia. He
is a member of both the Alpha Kappa Psi
business fraternity and Phi Gamma Delta. He
has never worked with the SGB before, but he
said he has learned from past members.’

Mary Fratis
Mary'Fratis, a Student Government Board can-
didate, said she feels Pitt's SGB should do more
to address student problems.

“Things are happening now and no one‘s do-
ing anything about them,"_ she said.

Fratis brieﬂy outlined her six-point platform
for her candidacy: all freshmen should be able

should administer excuses for students if they
miss classes due to illness; Pitt’s faculty should
be required to take an oral proﬁciency test
before they teach classes to students who may
not understand them; students should be able
to sell books back directly to students or they
should get more money for them at the book
center; Pitt faculty should be reviewed more
often to assess their capabilities; and the SGB
representative to Pitt’s Board of Trustees should
be chosen by students, not appointed by an ad-
ministration ofﬁcial.

Fratis said that she feels these are all impor-
tant issues because many of them have affected
her.

“I had a lot of trouble getting into the dorms
when I was a freshman, and I can’t believe that
we must learn from teachers who can barely
speak English,” she said. “The students are be-
ing cheated and I want the opportunity to do
something about it.

Ji arboden
Garboden is seeking a positionion the SGB
because of his experience as chairman of the

Freshman Council last year. He said that this A

has given him experience working with the stu-

him the confidence to be a board member this

‘i » The Pitt News, November 4,1985

While at Pitt, junior Sean Hannon experi-
enced many difficulties in his search for ade-
quate housing. Seeking an end to such prob-
lems, he has decided to run for a position on
the Student Government Board. .

“I kept saying ‘I wish they’d do this, I wish
they’d do that, ' so I ﬁnally thought it was time

to really do something rather than just talk about i

it,” Hannon said. ‘

.Hannon, 20, said he would like to create a
housing guide to help students who have already
experienced varied difficulties. Hannon also
said he would like to encourage Pitt to buy
apartment complexes in Oakland.

Last year, Hannon worked in the Provost’s
office as part of Pitt’s work study program. He
said the experience enabled him to “get a bet-
ter grasp” of the administrative process. He
said he could accomplish more because he
knows the people in the Provost’s office.

Hannon is a business/political science major
from New Castle, Pa.

Loard Candidate Review

Enhancing student awareness of university
policy is Konkolic’s main goal if elected to the
SGB. He said he would also like to further the
progress of the previous administration. He
stated that another goal of his .is toirid the
university of student apathy and to try to lift

‘school spirit. He also said he interested in bring-

ing up the issue of spring break.

 

Melanie Naro

“Communication is the main point,” said
SGB candidate Melanie Naro. “Everyone has
addressed it before, but this is the year to do it.”

According to N aro, who is running for SGB
for the first time this year, the mainproblem
with the SGB/student relationship is a lack of
communication, and her platform‘ centers
around this problem.

“The students don’t think that SGB is doing
anything because they don’t know what it is they
aredoing,” said Naro. “We just need to com-

sﬁriirsﬁriirsﬁriirikiirﬁrrﬁrikikiirikikiﬁrikiksﬁrikiirrﬁrikikiﬁrﬂrsﬁrikiﬁr

municate what we are doing.”

To address this problem, Naro proposed
surveys, newsletters and meetings, along with
personal contact by the board members.

“The best way to deal with people is to talk
to them directly,” said _Naro. “If I have to
knock on every door personally, I‘ll do it. I
think it is important.” .

Naro, who is a political science/philosophy
major, said that she was inspired to enter the
SGB race as a result of her campus involvement
with groups like Pitt Program Council,
Freshman Council and Chi Omega sorority.

“I found out what was going on around the
university and that it needed a change,” said
Naro. v r ‘

Library concerns and student apathy are the
other major points of Naro’s platform. Naro
said she would promote the expansion of library
hours at Hillman, a renovation of the library
facilities and the creation of more all-night study
locations.

“We are most importantly a learning institu-
tion,” said Naro. “It’s SGB’s job to uphold
that. People are promoting cable in the dorms
and we can’t even get the library to stay open
all night.”

Concerning student apathy Naro said she
believes it to be SGB’s duty to get students in-
volved: “If SGB doesn’t improve the com-
munication, then SGB is going to be up here
and the students .are going to be down there,
and they are going to stay apathetic. We have
to make an effort now.”

Jay Rothstein
Student Government Board candidate Jay
Rothstein said he feels that the role of SGB is
to act as a communications bridge between the
administration and the student body.

“It’s important to get the views of the
students to the administration. SGB should be
inﬂuencing them to take into consideration what
the students want done," stated Rothstein, a
second-year pharmacy student.

On Wednesday and Thursday, students will
be voting for the SGB president and members.
Rothstein said he feels that, out of eleven can-
didates. he is “perhaps more concerned. Be-
ing a pharmacy student and being affected by
the Five-Year-Plan has made me aware of how
unaware students areof the administration's

“When the F ive-Year-Plan went into effect,
very few students understood what was happen-
ing — even at the schools involved in the cuts.
It shouldn’t necessarily be up to the students
to find out what’s going on — it’s up to SGB
or the president to make them aware,” stated
Rothstein.

Rothstein said he feels that a daily or weekly
ﬂyer available to students is one way to inform
them. Another suggestion was to have SGB
members sit in a booth in the William Pitt Union
concourse area to answer questions and talk
with students. _

The 19-year-old candidate stated that hous-
ing is an issue of this election. “I can’t think
of a better way to handle campus housing. But
I do feel that the university administration and
SGB should use a task force to examine off-
campus housing. There’s no problem in ﬁnding
housing off campus, but sometimes it is of low
quality. This task force should go out and in-
spect local apartments. This might cause the im-
provement of such housing options,” Rothstein
stated.

The Villanova native is involved in the Men-
tor program and participated in the “Emerg-
ing Leaders” program his freshman year.
Rothstein also belongs to the Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon Fraternity.

“What I lack in experience, I make up in be-
ing concerned for the student body,” stated
Rothstein.

Monique Sims

_ “There has to be more togetherness on this
campus. I know we are a big university, but
we have to get over that obstacle,” said Moni-
que Sims, a sophomore SGB candidate whois
running for the first time.

Combatting student apathy and student hous-
ing problems are her goals for the 1985-86 "SGB
year. Openhouses, meetings, a continuation of
letter writing campaigns, and more student
liasons are some of Sims’ solutions to relieve
apathy. To remedy the housing problem, Sims
said, measures should be taken immediately.

“The housing situation is ridiculous now,"

said Sims. “The administration is promising
freshmen rooms, and then sending them away
without a place to live."
' Sims decided to run for SGB because of a
summer position on a newspaper public rela-
tions staff. “I saw that communications played
a major role in eliminating problems, and
misconceptions in biases."

‘The bias on SGB is a problem that Sims is
vowing to remedy. “I think, that there is too

;. .-  ..mI4c.h. bi.a.s.o.rx .t.h.e..St.u.d:=m: Qovernmsnt.-B9§td=l-.  . ~

/

now,” said Sims. “A lot of members seem to
be spending too much time attacking each other
and a lot of things are not being done. Everyone
needs to bea lot more open minded.”

Through her example and her sincerity, Sims
hopes to lessen the bias on the board.

“We all see the problems as the same,” said
Sims. “The only difference I see is that they
may not be as sincere as I am.”

Amy Unks

If elected, Student Government Board can-
didate Amy Unks will try to upgrade several
areas. '

“Off-campus housing is one priority,” she
said. “I think that the University of Pittsburgh
has a good center for off-campus housing, but

it is not well advertised and one of my goals_

would be making the students more aware of
this program.”

The school’s legal service is another concern.
“The SGB provides legal service for students,”
said Unks, a junior. “A lawyer comes in every
Friday and I don’t believe many students realize
this service is open to them — I would like to
make them aware of it also.”

Unks would also like to expand the universi-
ty meal plan. . ,

“When a student buys a meal ticket, right

I now. it is only for the Towers and I would like

it to be expanded to include other cafeterias,”
she said. “I am not sure it is feasible but at least
I would like to look into it and see if it is possi-
ble."

Unks believes the biggest weakness in the
current SGB is its own anonymity. “Most
students don't go to the meetings and they
should be made aware of them,” she said.
“They should let the students know that anyone
who wants to go to a meeting can go.
Everybody talks about student apathy but you
have to get the students involved and that is the
responsibility of the SGB.”

Why does she want to be in SGB?

“I think it would be a great learning ex- .

perience,” she said. “And I think I. can do a
good job. I’ve always liked to be involved and
I’m a very hard worker.”
Unks believes an SGB member should be ._a
hard worker. - .
“You should look for someone who is will-
ing to work,” she said. “Most of the big issues

won't be known until next year, so I think the ’

most important quality in a candidateshould be‘
willingnesstowork and I believe I am a hard

When it rains it pours

Pitt skid
continues

on sloppy

Saturday  

By Randy Miller
Staff Writer

Inconsistency. That’s the story of the
Pitt football team. One week up, the
next down. It’s hard to ﬁgure out which
Pitt team willmarch onto the field on
a given Saturday. ’

The same Panthers who lost convinc-
ingly to Navy last weekend made
another appearance Saturday against
Syracuse.

These are the Panthers who are
unable to put points on the board, the
Panthers who have more offensive
breakdowns than offensive plays-.
When these Panthers show up, they are
consistent. They do not score.

Pitt did not score Saturday. As a
result, Syracuse left town with a 12-0
victory, ending all possible bowl hopes
for the 4-4-1 Panthers.

The ‘Panthers had but one scoring op-
portunity on this cold, rainy day in
Pittsburgh. The ﬁrst time the Panthers
had the ball, they moved from their
own 20-yard line to Syracuse’s 19-yard
line in only seven plays. The running
of Charles Gladman sparked the drive
with runs of 23 and 13 yards.

Pitt has constantly proved this year
that they can move the ball between the
20-yard lines. When they getinside the
20-yard line, something usually goes
wrong. ,

Syracuse, led by All—America defen-
sive tackle Tim Green, suddenly
regrouped, forcing the Panthers into a
fourth-and-four from the Orangemen
18-yard line.

Realizing the ﬁeld goal unit failed the
team throughout the year (Mark Brasco
is only 5-13, Pat Viancourt 0-3), Pitt

first down. Gladman got the call but

came up a yard short. Drive over.

“We had the wind in our face a lit-
tle bit,” Fazio said. “I thought at first
we had made it, but I guess we came
up a little short.”

Syracuse head coach Dick MacPher-
son believed Pitt’s failure to score on
that drive was the key to the game.
“That drive was the most critical part
of the ball game,” he said. “That’s the
way it is when you don’t have a ﬁeld
goal kicker you can count on. Poor
Foge was forced to go for it. If Pitt
makes it, it’s a great drive, and it could

have been a different game.”

“It’s a mental problem we have,”
said Gladman, who finished the day
with 79 yards on 18 carries. “After we
didn't get that ﬁrst down on the first
drive, everyone thought, ‘Here we go
again.’ ” ‘

Syracuse immediately drove deep in-
to Pitt territory, but kicker Don
McAulay missed a 37-yard ﬁeld goal
attempt. ,

With Syracuse quarterback Don
McPherson running the option style of-
fense to perfection, McAulay received

Tight end Clint ilso the of th Pitt Pnther wefel stopped dead in their tracks agains

three chances to redeem himself. He
connected on two field goals from 32
and 29 yards out, giving the
Orangemen a 6-0 lead.

Pitt’s offense continued to struggle
while McPherson moved the ball with
success. Syracuse controlled the ball
for 37 minutes in the contest (compared
to only 23 for Pitt) while rushing the
ball 66 times for a total of 310 yards.

“When option teams have the ball
for so many plays,” Fazio said, “they
figure out what your doing defensive-

ly.” ‘

  

'"“We knew their_optio’n would be
tough to stop,” said Pitt defensive end
Tony Woods. “It was their quarterback
who hurt us —- he was so quick and
strong.”

MacPherson rushed for 59 yards but
more importantly kept Pitt defenders
off balance. He would keep one play
and pitch out the other. Freshman
tailback Robert Drummond was on the
receiving end for 11 option plays, gain-
ing 100 yards. Byron Abraham ran for

Panthers pound Youngstown State;
travel to Indiana in season final

All the offense that was absent in the
Pitt soccer team’s 2-0 loss to Carnegie-
Mellon last week reappeared on Satur-
day in Youngstown, Ohio. The Pan-
thers erupted for 10 goals against
Youngstown State and raised their
record to 11-3-l.

“Things really came together for us 1

today," said Pitt head coach Joe Lux-
bacher after the game.

Yes, indeed. The Panthers led 4-0
after the ﬁrst period, and Luxbacher
pulled in his starters for the duration
of the game. Every player who made
the trip to Ohio -got to see action. The
scoreboard was evidence of that fact as
10 different players contributed either
a goal or an assist.

“While Youngstown State may not
have been as tough as some of our other
opponents, we still played really well."
Luxbacher said.

Leading the scoring parade for the
Panthers were junior forwards Swaray
Kamara and Bob Howard, who each
scored two goals and added an assist.

Joining them with one goal each
were freshmen Erim Gude and John
Osberg, sophomore Scott Reimer and
seniors Brian Casey, Gary Gaido and
Sparky Lucke.

“We are passing the ball much bet-
ter," Luxbacher said.» “Our movement
around the ball was very good."

Freshman Sam Lanza led the pass-
ing attack with two assists, while

Kamara, Casey, Howard and Lucke all
added a single assist. It was a total team
effort.

“I thought we played really well,”
Luxbacher added. “We put the ball on
the ground more, and that is what we
wanted to do.” _

The Panthers will look to do the
sametoday when they travel to Indiana,
Pa., for a 3 p.m. game. It is Pitt’s last‘
regular-season game before the Big
East Championships next weekend.
The Panthers are 4-0 in the Big East.

Panther kicks: Sophomore mid-
ﬁelder Dave Moss had been playing
with a broken arm for part of the
season, and bad luck struck again.
Moss fractured his collarbone last week
and will not play the rest of the season.

The Pitt'New's, 'Novernbe'r4,”1‘9‘8'5. ‘ "‘

Luxbacher goes home to build
foundation for Pitt soccer team

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

It is easy to see why Joe Luxbacher
continues to recruit soccer players from
Upper St. Clair High School. Lux-
bacher, the soccer coach at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, is an Upper St. Clair
graduate himself and is well aware of
what these athletes are like. That is why
he has three USC alumni on his team

, this year.

._ )‘

r‘-‘i
J‘.-'

H‘

Continuing the tradition of being

Panthers are freshman John Osberg, .

sophomore Craig Freund and junior

' Seckin Ablak. All three are typical of

what Luxbacher has come to expect
from Upper St. Clair grads.

“They come from a very strong pro-
gram,” Luxbacher stated. “They were
very well coached. They were well-
drilled and well-disciplined. They are
all good soccer players.”

While Osberg is only in his first year
at Pitt, he is already making an impact
on the team. “I’m really pleased with
the way John has played,” Luxbacher
said. “He has a lot of potential. I didn’t
expect him to contribute as much as he
has. I thought it would take a year for
him to develop, but he has done a lot.
He is a very intelligent and coachable
player.” '

Luxbacher is not the only one sur-
prised about the contributions the
talented freshman has made. Osberg
himself was not expecting to get the
chance that he has to contribute. “I am

really happy with the amount of play- .

ing time that I’ve got,” Osberg said.
“I really didn’t expect it. I want to pro-
duce for the team. We are playing well,
and it is exciting.”

Saying that the Panthers are playing
well under Luxbacher, a second-year
coach, is a slight understatement. Lux-
bacher took a team that was 9-10-1 in
1983 and turned it into a 9-6-1 team in
1984 and a 10-2-1 team so far this
season. The Panthers also won the
Southern Division of the Big East Con-
ference this season with a 4-0 record.

The team’s turnaround can be
credited to Luxbacher’s coaching
abilities and the talent he has recruited.
One of the players that has helped make
the difference is Craig Freund, a star-
ting defender. “When Craig came out
of high school, I knew he was a great
athlete,” Luxbacher said. “He is the

Jerry Rubin

best pure athlete we have on the team.
He is a natural. He has really worked
hard, and his defensive game is solid.”

F reund always gives the extra effort
in both practice and games and is
always willing to learn something new.
“We wouldn’t have a good record if
we didn’t do the things Joe tells us to,"
Freund said. “He tries to make up new
drills for us in practice for a change.
Sometimes it works! It is easier play-
ing this year because we have
everybody back. We know how to play
together.”

While Osberg and Freund have seen
a lot of action this season, Ablak has
been forced to contend with a limited
amount of playing time. The reason for
that is because he plays behind Uzoma
Chibundu, one of the best players in
the East.

“It’s hard not getting a lot of play-
ing time,” Ablak admitted, “but
Uzoma is a really good player. I guess
it’s just bad luck. I have learned a lot
from him, though. He is a good leader
— really intense. He gets people going.

, “I really like soccer,” he continued.
“I want to stick with it. I like practice
because it gives me a chance to play.
I have no regrets about being here. Joe
is smart. He knows what to do. He gets
a lot out of his players.”

There is more to these three than just

being soccer players. They are all
polite, friendly, outgoing and just plain
old nice guys. In addition, they are
good students who spend a con-
siderable amount of time studying.

Freund, a business major, must find
time between classes, practices and
games in order to keep on top of his
classes, which include chemistry,
calculus and psychology. “You don’t
have much free time,” Freund said.
“You just have to work hard. You can
make it, though.”

The three of them came to Pitt not
just for soccer but more importantly to
get a good education, and that is what
they are doing. “Pitt has a really good

academic program," said Osberg, an 2

information science major. “I keep
busy with school and soccer. I have
classes most of the day, have an hour-
and-a-half break, go to practice and
then study at night. It is not easy."
Being an engineering major, Ablak
is also well aware of the demands

_ placed on being a student athlete. “My

schedule does not allow me much free
time,” Ablak commented. “The time
I do have I use to study.” .

You can be sure that with all the

talent from Upper St. Clair on the team-

these days that the Pitt-USC connec-
tion is one that will be intact for a long
time.

The Sporting Life

“""'The Pitt"Ne‘w§, November 4,'"‘I985

By Bob Travers

Some changes can be made at Pitt, but not necessarily at head coach

ofthis magnitude certainly can’t hurt. 

If you could pick one moment as be- .

ing the low point of Pitt football in re-
cent years, it would probably be the
closing moments of the Pitt-Syracuse
game Saturday.

An eternal drizzle dampened and
darkened the stadium’s Astroturf and
the faces of the few who stayed.
Syracuse 12, Pitt 0. The rain was bad,
yes, but one cloud hung over Oakland
last Saturday that was darker than any
the heavens could produce.

.The question of the future of the Pitt
football program can now be faced only
with a good deal of wondering and
more than a little fear. Pitt is now 4-4-1
with no hopeof post-season play for
the second year in a row. The head
coach may or may not be ﬁred in a mat-
ter of weeks, the offense sparks at times
but never seems able to really burn and
the defensive secondary is one of the
worst in the nation. On top of that, the
student body regards the team with
apathy if not downright antipathy.

To paraphrase Bruce Springsteen:
Troubled times have come to your
home team.

The reason for such doom and gloom
is that the Panthers have absolutely
nothing to build on, comingoff the last
two weeks. Usually, even in a loss,
there is something good a coach can
point to -— maybe the play of a quarter-
back or an outstanding play by the
defensive line. But this is not the case
with Pitt. There has been nothing good
for this football team in the last two
games. _

The offense has provided only seven
points in the last eight quarters. The
defense has yielded 33 points, and this
to Navy and Syracuse, who are not ex-
actly the greatest powers the game has
ever seen.

The 1985 season‘, which two weeks
ago held such promise, has slipped
from Pitt's hands like the slippery balls
that snaked through receivers’ hands in
Saturday’s Rain Bowl.

So what is to be done?

First of all, Fazio should demand that
Athletic Director Ed Bozik tell him his
status with Pitt. Fazio should simply
ask Bozik if he will be back next year
and expect an answer now. If Fazio is
assured he will be back in 1986, he
must begin now to work for next year.
. I am hardly an expert in college foot-
ball,_a_n_d I ’m not pretending to be one

The time is now for Pitt to wake up some echoes oftheir own. How do you think
the team would look in gold jerseys?

here, but I do have a few ideas and
observations on what Pitt might do to
get out of their rut.

First of all, I would play Charles
Gladman the entire game. Inexplicably,
he has been sitting out several series
while other backs sub for him, even
when Gladman has been 100 percent.
Gladman has the potential to become
one of the top backs in the nation, and
he should be utilized as much as
possible.

Another thing I would do is nothing
less than change the offensive strategy

future coming-

completely. I think Pitt should switch
to an option-type offense and run out
of a wishbone formation. Running back
is the deepest position the Panthers
have, and they should take advantage
of that. This is also a nice solution to
the problem of having to platoon Glad-

man and Brian Davis. With the option, ’

both backs could play the entire game
along with Tom Brown and Ironhead
Heyward, who returns next year. But
who to quarterback?

Try someone new. John Congemi
won’t be here next year anyway, and
this season he has proved ineffective.

Down by less than a touchdown, why did Pitt quit going to Gladman

All great tailbacks must carry the ball
a good many times in order to be
effective.

Pitt looked like it was going to utilize
the team’s great tailback, Charles Glad-
man, on Saturday and then unex-
plainably deserted him. The result was
the 12-0 loss at the hands of Syracuse.

' Perhaps a closer look will better ex-

plain the point.

0 Pitt wins the toss and elects to
receive the opening kickoff. On the en-
suing drive, Gladman chalks up 55
yards on eight carries as the Panthers
drive downﬁeld as if Syracuse was
playing the junior varsity unit on
defense.

The Panthers’ drive eventually stalls
on fourth-and-four at the Syracuse
18-yard line when Gladman comes up
a yard short on a sweep to the left.
Regardless, the Panthers showed they
could move the ball at will, and it
looked as if a big day was ahead for
Gladman. This did not‘ turn out as
expected.

0 Gladman would carry the ball 11
times for 68 yards in the first quarter
but only ﬁnish with 18 carries for 79
yards in the game. No one knows why
the Pitt coaching staff went away from
Gladman. , ‘

0 At the end of the third quarter, Pitt
trailed 6-0, but the Panthers were still
ignoring Gladman.

0 From the end of the ﬁrst quarter
until midway through the fourth quarter
when Syracuse went up 12-0, Pitt
would run 40 plays from the offensive
line of scrimmage, but only six were
Gladman running plays.

‘ ‘Gladman is a great back, and he ex-
empliﬁed it by the way he performed
on the first drive,” said Syracuse head
coach Dick MacPherson. “On the sec-
ond drive, we made some key defen-

sive adjustments. We made the correct
adjustments and shut down the running
game.’ ’

Maybe so, but it looked as if Pitt shut
down the Pitt running game.

“I don’t want to complain about how
much I get the ball,” Gladman said,
“[but] I could take the ball 30 times a

. game.”

As for the game, Gladman was just
as mystiﬁed about the outcome as he
was about his lack of carries. “I don’t
know what happened,” he said.
‘ ‘Maybe it was the ﬁrst drive. We were
moving, getting close, and then we
were stopped. It gets frustrating when
that happens.”

Pitt offense washed away by Syracuse

continued from page 13

“Constantly in the huddle, someone
would say, ‘Someone has to make the
big play,’ ” Woods said. “That’s
pressure. We have to take chances to
try to give the offense good ﬁeld posi-
tion. Sometimes you try to create a play
that isn’t there. You start reaching for
the ball and it cuts out the fundamen-
tals. ’ ’

The Pitt defense stood tall, however,
giving the offense every opportunity to
take the lead. Despite struggling against
the Syracuse rushing attack, the Pitt
defense permitted only two ﬁeld goals

until late in the game. With 3:19 re--

maining, Drummond scored on a four-
yard sweep to give Syracuse a 12-0
lead.

After Pitt’s opening drive, the Pan-
thers could not move the ball,. register-

“We were getting ﬁve and six yards
a crack,” quarterback John Congemi
said, who played perhaps his best game
of the year despite being a victim of
quite a few dropped passes. “Maybe
we could have opened it up a little
more.” ,

Congemi did not question the Pitt
play selection, however. “It is not my
decision,” he said. “Whatever play
comes in, I’ll give it 150 percent.”

Maybe Pitt should re-evaluate its
play calling. Behind Gladman, the Pan-
thers controlled the ball in the ﬁrst
quarter, but beyond that, it was all
Syracuse. It just doesn’t add up. Why

_ did Pitt give Gladman the cold shoulder

ing only nine ﬁrst downs the rest of the
game.

Pitt quarterback John Congemi did
throw for 190 yards, but he was never
able to put completions together.

“We haven’t been able to wrap the
offensive game plan up into one
game,” said Pitt ﬁillback Tom Brown.
‘ ‘There’s always one person or another

,making a mistake offensively. We

don’t have the unity.”

Pitt entered Syracuse territory only
four times all day:

0 The first drive of the game.

0 Pitt moved to Syracuse’s 49-yard
line in the second quarter but punted
from the 49-yard line.

0 Steve Apke intercepted a pass in
the third quarter, giving Pitt the ball at
Syracuse’s 47-yard line. Pitt punted
from the 42-yard line.

after the ﬁrst quarter? Fazio had no
explanation.

‘ ‘I don’t know,” said Fazio simply.

There is no explanation, only
hindsight.

“We put too much emphasis on the
running game early,” Congemi said,
‘ ‘and we put too much emphasis on the
passing game late.” -

Even members of the Pitt defense
were puzzled by the performance of the
offense. The defense allowed only 12
points despite being on the ﬁeld for
close to 37 minutes.

“It was a tough one, ’ ’ said defensive
end Tony Woods. “I’ll speak for the
defense. We only gave up 12 points.

We did the job.”

“This kind of game leaves you emp-
ty,” said safety Bill Callahan.“‘You
have to put it behind you. We knew
they were a good football team, and we
prepared for them. We took this game
as serious as a heart attack.”

Maybe CPR is what is needed to
resuscitate this team from the two-game
losing streak it is currently not
enjoying.

With only two games remaining, the
best the Panthers can finish is 6-4-1.
Not a trademark of Pitt teams from the
last decade, but then again, a lack of
offense was not a trademark of Pitt
teams from the past decade either.

0 Congemi connected with tight end
Clint Wilson late in the second quarter
for 30 yards to the Syracuse 12-yard
line. Wilson fumbled after being hit,
and Syracuse recovered.

‘ ‘You get kind of frustrated, ’ ’ Glad-
man said. “Physically we have a bet-
ter football team than Syracuse, a bet-
ter football team than Ohio State. It’s
more of an attitude problem.”

‘ ‘Last year there was no light at the
end of the tunnel,” Congemi added.
“I’m down because this team was
destined for stardom. Last year we lost
our ﬁrst four games. We started off
good this year beating Purdue. And we
kicked Ohio State’s ass, not on the
scoreboard but in the total yardage.”

Maybe Pitt was destined for stardom,
but their inconsistency has them only
4-4-1 with two games remaining.

The talent is there, but something is
wrong.“I don’t know what it is,”
Fazio said.

The Good Approach 

 

Pitt may be in Detroit in December

- As the ﬁnal seconds ticked off the

clock, there was an empty feeling on
the Panther sideline. Not only did the
Pitt football team see any chance for
a bowl appearance get w-ashed away,
but they had just been squeezed by the
Orangemen of Syracuse 12-0. The loss
was the ﬁrst shutout against Pitt since
1975 when Navy sunk Pitt’s ship 17-0.

So where does this 4-4-1 football
team go from here? Head coach Foge
Fazio is hoping for a comeback.
“Well, we have another football game
to play,” he said, “and hopefully the
"kids will rebound, and I’m sure they’ll
go out and play when the time comes.”

It would seem the only thing left for
this team is its pride to salvage a win-
ning season following last year’s 3-7-1
record. To do so, Coach Fazio must get
his team’s attention in order to point
them in an upward direction. If this
team is to rebound, leadership must
also come from several seniors who
have to rally the team in the next two
games. '

One such person could be senior
quarterback John Congerni. “I’m look-
ing forward to playing Temple and

Penn State,” he said. “I have two more
games left, and then I’m done here. I
want to go out and play two of the best
games I ever played.”

Those are certainly great “rah—rah”
statements to rally behind, but keep in
mind this offense only scored seven
points in two weeks. Unless the Pan-
ther offense wakes up and comes to
life, the inconsistency that has plagued
them all year could hit rock bottom by
dropping the ﬁnal two games.

Who is to blame for the poor
performances throughout this up-and-
down season? Many will blame Fazio,
but with the exception of the Navy
game, Fazio hasn't been outcoached.

Syracuse coach Dick MacPherson
can feel for him. “He’s [Fazio] trying
to play the game the way it’s supposed
to be played and run a program the way
it’s supposed to be run,” he said. “To
have the defections and injuries he’s
had over the past two years and the
pressure he's had, I think it’s com-
pounded. I do feel bad for him.”

Before you write off Fazio or his
team, allow them to redeem themselves
in the upcoming weeks. Despite the in-
juries they’ve suffered, this team has

gone out and battled every week.
Before the “boo birds” begin calling
for Fazio’s job, allow them to finish the
season first. i

“I think our guys are a little disap-
pointed and down," Fazio said about
his team’s effort Saturday, “but they
played very, very hard." They have
played hard, and this team does want
to win.

Sophomore linebacker Jerry Wall
certainly spoke for his teammates.
“We are very down,” he said. “We’re
going to go out and try and win the next
two and to try and keep our pride.
We’ll go out and do the best we can.
We‘re gonna go out fighting and win
the next two games.”

The season isn’t over yet for this
young and injury-plagued team. If they
can beat Temple and then upset cur-
rently unbeated and No.1 Penn State,
there is a bowl played in Detroit that
just may have Pittsburgh. You could
call me an eternal optimist, but the
Cherry Bowl would love to have the
Pitt Panthers at their game. The name
alone would draw a crowd to that
economically depressed city.
