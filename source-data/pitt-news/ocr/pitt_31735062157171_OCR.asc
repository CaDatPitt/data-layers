Ed Zadorozny Only
Man to Break Slate

Write-ins Fall Short

By Harry Byron Keck
Managing Editor

Fraternity political power once again proved supreme on campus

the entire IF slate was swept into

ofﬁce in both Student Congress and Men's Council with the exception
of Greek-sponsored Frank Blackstone, IF Council president, who was
proposed as a write-in candidate for Congress by the frat men.
Only YMCA president Ed Zadorozny succeeded in breaking the
frat slate by garnering votes at Ellsworth Center among freshmen

and sophomore men who knew

Of all the sponsored and self-
appointed write-in candidates only
Frank Blackstone received more
than 150 votes.

Anticipated, heavy voting failed
to materialize. Only 861 votes
were cast compared to 957 ballots
counted in last spring’s elections.

' Complaints against the voting
procedure were registered from
several quarters. Chief opposition
centered around the change in lo-.
cation of the Cathedral polls from
the originally announced Schenley
Room to the band rehearsal
room on the eighth floor.

from the polls because of the long

Wet Blanket
No one expected Pitt men to turn out VVed-
nesday like the Italians did Sunday, but it

‘did seem as if the pre-election bull sessions in-

dicated more than the usual interest in the
Men’s Council-Student Congress balloting.

A ﬁrmly-founded Independent group with
a positive platform was battling the traditional
frat slate, each side boasting good men. There
were several lone hats tossed into the ring by
men with a strong individual backing. The
stage was set for a really representative vote.

Come VVednesday, the ﬁrst hitch appeared

,with the last-minute switch of the Cathedral

polling place to the eighth ﬂoor. VVhen would-
be votters ﬁnally found their way to the polls.
the line jammed outside the six machines dis-
couraged all but the most patient, while the
inefﬁcient write-in system slowed the process
almost to a stand-still.

On top of everything, the question -of how
the Greek voters knew the candidate numbers
on the machines‘ two days in advance threw a"
cloud over the entire affair. All in all, i_t was

I a pretty wet blanket that shroudedfthe eighth

ﬂoor Wednesday afternoon.

What I Next ?

Pitt’s Independent Association entered and

' lost its ﬁrst election on VVednesday. The ques-

tion naturally arises: VVhere do they go from
there?

Last fall, when the Independents ﬁrst or-
ganized, they received some words of advice

~ from the president of Carnegie-Tech’s well-

established independent group. He told them, in
effect that politics should be a secondary con-
cern to the organization——subordinate- to the
primary purpose ofoﬁering to theiindependent
student a well-rounded program of extra-cur-
ricular activities.

The Independents heard the warning, but

‘ whether or not they will heed it is another mat-

ter. The next few months should tell. If the
men who founded the PIA were thinking pri-

marily in terms of obtaining political power on-

the campus, then the Association soon will suf-

.fer'a ‘quick and little-lamented death.

If, on the other hand, these men are inter-
ested sincerely in bettering the college life
of their members there is no reason to believe
that an election defeat, complete though it
was, interposes any serious obstacle to their
success. The need for an independent organi-
zationis still great. Properly organized and
directed it can give its members a chance to
‘enjoy a social life otherwise closed to them.
It can also help to revive the long-listless spirit
of unaffiliated students.

-For the future the ‘Association must steer
clear of the twin rocks upon which many a

similar group has foundered. First, there is

the tendency to exaggerate the importance of
politics. Secondly, there is the temptation to
become an opposition group, existing solely

‘for the purpose of ‘being anti-fraternity.

So far the Independent Association has man-

‘ aged to avoid bothpitfalls. If it can continue

to do so, it will be a good bet to remain around
for a long time, and an even better bet to do

the independents and the school .a great deal

of good.

Necking Comes Out

File

Harry Byron Keck

I’m somewhat alarmed by the rapid growth
of contemporary morals. The ﬁne traditional moral
scheme under which I was educated is Limbo-
bound along with all its truisms and platitudes.

The case in point is the recent utterance of a
dean of women at one of the “exclusive” women’s
colleges, in which she praised necking as a “whole-
some practice.” _

“Necking is wholesome,” she said, “so long
' as you don’t go several miles into the woods
where you’re alone with temptation.”

Wholesome indeed!

Ten years ago she would have jeopardized her

Info Open Affer Years

In Dark Corners

position by making such a statement. Today no ;
one seems to care miich one way or the other. ;

The hitherto subversive and surreptitious art of
necking has attained its majority.

Less than 40 years ago people laughed at the I

Wright brothers. Today no self-respecting college
dares publish a course catalogue without listing a
few pages of ﬂying courses and courses in aero-
nautical design. - ~

Now that the educators have recognized,
necking as being worthwhile, who can tell
what courses our generation’s progeny will
ﬁnd in the college catalogues circa 1970?

Last week I noticed in one of the New’York
newspapers that the student body president at
Washington University does notlpermit his dates
to smoke in his car on the way home from dances
and parties. “The cigarette,” he says, “is a mighty
defensive weapon for a girl whose escort his amor-
ous.” ‘

Another Washington student doesn’t ap-
prove of drinking because. in his words,
“there are other ways of enjoying yourself
when out with a. girl.” '

Well, maybe necking is wholesome at that. If

"you consider smoking and drinking unwholesome,

then necking, by superseding these unwholesome
practices, might be considered wholesome.
At least thechange will be novel. No more
hangovers! No more smoking coughs!
In any event the lines are drawn. The
course of. action is clear. .
I don’t know what you’re going to_ do,’ but I’m
seeing my" broker this afternoon about corner-
ing the lipstick market.

Pitt’s “International Ball.” Just before the war
Shep Fields was one of -the best bands in the
country. With the outbreak of the war and Mr.

larity took a beating. But over a period of years the
public’s clamoring "for Field’s ‘ old “Rippling

Now that he has sold the Glen Island Casi-
no he is back on the bandstand where his heart
belongs. This will be the first appearance of
Shep Fields Orchestra at Pitt. Featured" with

Writer Takes Poker 1

Editor, the Pitt News:

We, in our official capacities as co-presidents of AU Beta Su,
feel that there is not a suiﬁcient volume of political participation on
our campus. As big men on campus, we feel it is our joint respon-
sibility to promote student activity in politics and greater subsequent 

activity upon graduation.

In keeping faith with this responsibility and in carrying our-
own “party line” to completion, we would like to take this oppor_- I

Inghis post-college career, he de-
veloped the -lone asset of a single

Shep Fields Wanted
To Play Sax So He
Started Own Band

Shep Fields who comes to the
Chess Arena for Pitt's "Interna-
tional Ball” never has been in any
but the music business.

As Shep progressed, the trade
moved forward and his new ideas
served as a guide for other men
who formed the musical tastes of

t. e nation.

; Having been told by his music
teacher in high school that the
ﬁaxaphone was not acceptable as
a classical instrument he set about
érganizing a dance band that play-
fed for all proms and fraternity
._hops in the school. Since music
fwas the best way to earn a living
lyoung Shep continued on with his
pand and played engagements

V,-‘along the New Jersey roadside

i

’ disappointment at

circuit.

Before long his popularity earn-
ed him offers from other areas
and the best of these was an offer
from the staid Palmer House in
Chicago.

Shep and his orchestra set an
all-time record by staying nine
months at the Palmer House. by

this time he had developed his

‘ .‘»~r‘v‘-'

“Rippling Rhythm,” which was
originated when he was sipping a
soda and whistling at the same
time.

In 1943 he tired of “Rippling
Rhythm” and started a new idea
which he called “New Music.” It
was an instantaneous hit, but over
a period of three years it became
apparent that public’s clamoring
for “Rippling Rhythm” could not
be ignored.

In 1948 Shep gave up the band

to operate the Glen Island Casino.
When the public openly showed
not ﬁnding
Fields on the bandstand, he made
arrangements for forming his band
again. It was then that Glen sold
his Casino and, the feel of the
baton in hand, took to the road.
His heart will always be on the
baridstand. ‘

This will be the ﬁrst appearance
of Shep Field’s orchestra at Pitt.
Featured with . him will be the
“Modernaires,” famed recording
artists and stars of the “Chester-
ﬁeld Supper Club.” .

Price of admission to the Spring
Festival dance will be $3.25 on a
single ticket and, $2.75 on the strip
‘ticket.

‘wandering around the campus
with a $4,000 problem on his mind
last week and wondering about
the strange ways of American

He entered a Bloomington bank

a minimum deposit of $5,000
would be accepted. Back to the

Wasting no time, he wrote home
for $4,000.

Yesterday a friend saw him
with a thick roll of ﬁves, tens, and

His money was accepted. What’s
more, there’s $4,000 more on the

Ends In Week

John S. Smith, president of the
Farmers Deposit National Bank,
leads the American Cancer Soci-
ety’s annual campaign for funds in

Allegheny County in the drive
which began April 1 and lasts
throughout the month.

“This is a campaign of hope,”
said Mr. Smith. “The American
Cancer Society is making great
progress in its ﬁght against can-
cer,” he declared, “but we can’t
rest until the cause and cure of
this dreaded disease are discov-
ered.” '

Stressing the importance of sup-
porting the Cancer Society, Mr.
Smith‘ said, “We know everyone
will want to contribute to this life-
saving campaign, and we’re mak-
ing it easy to do so. Simply mail
your gift to “ ‘Cancer, Pitts-
burgh’.”

Marriage Counsellor Advises

Girls to Bait Hook Right

COLUMBUS, O.—“Fishing for a man is like ﬁshing for a career,
and you have to bait your hook right to catch the right one,” Dr.
Evelyn Duval, executive secretary of the National Council on Family
Relations, told a group of Ohio State university students at a “Mar-
riage as a Career” conference here. ' is

Dr. Duval stated that while college women have a 10 per cent}
less chance of marrying than non—college women, those that do
marry stand a better chance of making a success of marriage.

“There are certain factors that will determine whether your
marriage will be a success or not,” she continued. “The main ones
are adjustment to environment and people before marriage, maturity,
and religion. Do not believe the old tale that opposites attract. You
“must choose someone like your-

self.”

Dr. Duval said that it is the
woman who has to do the most
adjusting, so that it is ‘she who
should ask herself the most ques-
tions before marriage. She sug-
gested explicit questions such as:
Is the girl ready? Does she realize
what she is getting into? Can she
put her desires secondary?

In conclusion, she stated, “Re-
member, if you get the wrong One
on your hook, you can always
throw him back and get another.
This is the one advantage of long
engagements. There are no sal-
aries, rewards, vacations, or pro-
motions in this career. The divi-
dends are up*to you. You must
create the satisfaction that you
‘wish to get from your marriage.”

Milligan, Aides
Give Approval
To Michelosen

By Max Scherb
Pitt ’s sweating coaching staﬁ
paused long enough from their
spring drills to wipe the pers-
piration from their brows and

wish John Michelosen the best
of luck in his new job as head
coach of the professional Pitts-
burgh Steelers.

Mike Milligan, Panther head
coach and a former colleague of
Michelosen in 1938, had more
brow to wipe than any of his staff
but his statement was the short-
est, “John is a good boy.”

Then the chorus came in from
the assistant coaches, led by Josh
Williams, who were sharing one
tattered towel " “
and looking
covetingly a t
t h e s n o w y
m o d el Mike
was soloing on.
They twitted,
“.Wish him well
for all of us.”

B a c k f i e l d
mentor Dick
Cassiano, forcg .
ed to release Wluiams
his hold, stopped long enongh to
point out the advantage of having
Michelson as a head _coach.
“Johnny is a keen student of the
game and he will win his share,”
he said.

He_ added that the new coach
can get along well with the play-
ers.

Michelosen graduated from Pitt
in ’38 after quarterbacking what
the late Dr. John B. (Jock) Suth-
erland called his greatest team,
in ’37. He coached at Pitt and
remained as Sutherland’s assist-
ant until the Doctor’s death.

The coaches described Michel-
osen as colorless yet amiable. He
lives up to his name, “Little Stone
Face.”

Fritz Reiner Conducts
‘Farewell’ Concert

The Pittsburghsymphony Society announced today that a special
“farewell” concert will be conducted by Dr. Fritz Reiner, who is
relinquishing his post as musical director of the Orchestra after 10
seasons, on Saturday evening, April 24, at Syria Mosque.

A program of popular symphonic works including Brahms’ Sym-
phony No.1 in C Minor, Richard Strauss’ Tone-poem, “Don Juan,”
Maurice Ravel’s choreographic poem, “La Valse,’’ and Richard Wag-

ner‘s prelude to “Die Meistersing-
er” has been arranged.

For his ﬁnal appearance with
the Orchestra, probably the last
opportunity Pittsburghers will
have to see him conduct the Pitts-

burgh Symphony, Dr. Reiner has

selected works of composers "of
whom he has been considered a
foremost exponent throughout his

7 career.

During the last ten years, Pitts-
burghers have witnessed the de-
velopment of a superb orchestral
instrument in their city, compar-
able to the ﬁnest in the United
States. It has been a decade of
spectacular growth during which
the Pittsburgh Symphony, by vir-
ture of tremendously increased
ﬁnancial aid from music-loving
and civic-minded Pittsburghers,
leaped into the nationalsymphonic
limelight, surpassing many major
symphony orchestras with a long-
er history.

Tickets for the “farewell” con-
cert are available at Kaufmann’s,
Gimbel’s, and Iiorne’s.

Students Rate
Profs. Courses

ANN ARBOR, Mich. (IP) -—
Student ratingslof _their instruc-
tors and courses will be apart
of a new and inclusive plan for
evaluation of faculty services re-
cently adopted by the faculty of

‘the University of Michigan Col-
lege of Literature, Science, and

the Arts. ,
Expected to go into effect on
an experimental basis during the

current academic year, the plan

also. calls for judgment of fac-

_ ulty‘ services by faculty commit-

tees from each teaching depart-

* ment.

Thorough Evaluation
In ‘addition to the student rat-

ings of instruction and course con-

tent, the evaluation of a faculty
member’s effectiveness will in-
clude information concerning en-
rollmentand grades in his class-
es, teaching activities outside the
classroom, ‘ and reports of col-

leagues and counselors.

Students will be asked to

"“grade” their instructors accord-

ing to a printed form distributed
in the classroom at the end of the
semester.
Rate Courses, Too

These rating forms ask the stu-
dent to check the quality of in-
struction under such headings as
“clarity of assignments, presenta-
tion of subject matter, success in
keeping ‘students alert in class,
availability for consultation with
students.” Each student will also
be asked to rate the course, re-
gardless of the quality of instruc-
tion. .

Students will ﬁll out_ rating
forms anonymously.

College Starts
Drive To Stop
Poor English

CHENEY, Wash. (IP)-— How
every member of the faculty at
Eastern Washington College of
Education participates actively in
the improvement of a student’s
English was explained by Dr. Gra-
ham M. Dressler, acting head of
the division of languages and lit-
erature.

“Any instructor, in any college,
who is dissatisﬁed with the Eng-
lish used, by a student in the
course, may -notify the student
that credit in that course will be
withheld pending a clearance from
the English department.

“The instructor notifies the Eng-

lish department of his action and
requires the student’ to report to
the English department oﬂice.

The student will be assigned
there to an instructor for diagnosis
and a series of conferences to cor-
rect his weakness in English.

“The instructor will notify the
original instructor when the stu-
dent is discharged from the Eng-
lish department, thereby releasing
the ‘X/ithheld credits.”

Pm Flying Club Arranges

 

For Reduced Rate Iinstruction 

Solo ﬂying licenses for as little as $33 are now available to Pitt
students who join the Pitt Flying Club, according to an announcey

ment by president Roy Riehl.

Under arrangements just completed with Mr. Earl B. Lafean,
proprietor of the Oakmont Seaplane Base in Oakmont, Pitt stu-
dents may obtain ﬂight instruction at the Allegheny river base for

$5 per hour.

“This is considerably lower than
the rates charged by private ﬂy-
ing schools, and is nearer a ﬁgure
that university ‘students will be
able ‘to afford,” stated Riehl.

Riehl explained that the reduc-
ed rates have been made possible

-with the inauguration _of a new

plan whereby ﬂight instruction

will be offered by Pitt Flying Club 1

members who are licensed in-
structors with the Civil Aeronau-

I tics Authority.

A student’s instruction may pro-

ceed as fast or as slow as his bud- I

get allows, Riehl pointed out. Solo
ﬂights are made after six to ten
hours of instruction, according to
the aptitude of the student.
Flying will begin sometime in
May, and will continue "without

interruption throughout the sum-'

mer for those desiring lessons
then.
