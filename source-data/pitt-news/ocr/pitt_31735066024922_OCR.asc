Pitt black faculty focus on athletes’ education

By Christine Hanna
Staff Writer

More emphasis on education for college
athletes was the focus of the first spring
session of the Black Faculty Forum Series
yesterday.

Dr. Audrey Murrell and Associate Provost
for Undergraduate Programs Jack Daniel
oversaw the panel of guests which
included former Pitt basketball player
Curtis Aiken, Assistant to the Provost Ron
Brown, who is also director of Academic
Support for Student Athlete Programs,
Professor Barbara Sizemore and Professor
Ogle Duff.

Brown, the first panelist to speak, went
over the 1992 NCAA convention highlights.
Proposal No. 14 and Proposal No. 16, will
both go into effect for first—year college
athletes after Aug. 1, 1995.

The proposals will effect the core-
curriculum requirements and the initial-
eligibility index. To be eligible to play
collegiate sports, students will need a high
school grade—point average of 2.5, an SAT
score of 700 and an ACT score of 17.

According to Brown, another proposal
for collegiate athletes is on time restraints,
which allow athletes no more than 20
hours of practice a week with one day
off.

Brown said that student athletes need to
be kept on par with the new requirements.
He also said that each university must
provide athletes with a support system
including tutoring, counseling and financial
aid.

Duff, of the School of Education, said
that changes need to be made to improve
the future for black college athletes.
Whenever the athletic potential is seen,

athletes are nutured to become the best,
but they also need to be nurtured in the
education ﬁeld.

According to Duff, a tutorial program
needs to be provided for junior high and
high school students who spend a lot of
time in practice.

She said that there needs to be a
change in academic and athletic
curriculum.

Students who are athletes cannot remain
in non—academic classes if they want to go
on to higher education.

The people who are coming to college
presently, who may not have taken the
academic courses, gradually expect
themselves to fail in academic instances,
Duff said.

“Coaches and other people involved
with student athletes need to help [them].
It's necessary to have a game plan. They

need guidance to have a back-up
education,” Duff said.

Sizemore, professor of Black Community
Education Research and Development,
emphasized the college education of an
athlete.

According to Sizemore, the tutorial
programs need to be expanded at the
university level and highly structured.

Sizemore also said that in some cases
the athletes’ travel schedules do not provide
enough study time and many classes are
missed,so traveling tutors need to be
increased.

She went on to say that the professors
and athletic departments need to
coordinate, especially for African
American athletes or anyone who comes

from a deprived educational
background.

Pitt doctors
use Prozac
for panic
disorders

By Robyn Petrella
For Tbe Pitt News

The controversial anti-
depressant drug Prozac is being
tested on patients who experience
a fear of open areas caused by a
panic disorder.

Dr. Duncan Clark, assistant
professor of psychiatry at Pitt, is
in the process of testing 30 patients
for the affects of Prozac on bouts
of anxiety. The individuals
involved in this study are victims
of severe panic attacks that are
characterized by an array of
symptoms ranging from dizziness
to an irregular heartbeat.

The patients in the study suffer
from agoraphobia, a fear of open
areas. For these people a routine
walk around the Cathedral of
Learning or a crowded shopping
mall is a traumatic experience.

Prozac is being tested in a
comprehensive assessment of the
panic disorder and the affects it
has on the disorder. The
controlled study is being held at

Researchers test new osteoporosis drug

the Western Psychiatric Institute
& Clinic and involves an interview
to determine the severity of the
condition.

By Christine Hanna
Sta_[f Writer

Researchers at Pitt’s Graduate
School of Public Health will be
participating in the largest national
trial to test a drug for the
prevention of broken bones and
fractures in elderly women due
to osteoporosis.

The Fracture Intervention Trial
will examine the outcome of
Merck 8: Company, Inc.’s new
investigational drug, alendronate.

Dr. Jane Cauley, assistant

professor of epidemiology, is the
chief investigator. Cauley said, “It
is an important study in terms of
women’s health. Osteoporosis is
a [major] women’s health
problem.”

Osteoporosis is brittle bones.
As men and women age, they
lose bone mass. It is primarily a
female’s disease since it
accelerates during menopause.

Shoulder, pelvis, wrist and
spine are the points most
commonly fractured or broken.
The most important injury to

general health are hip fractures.
According to Cauley, 12 to 20
percent of people who suffer
from a hip fracture die, and 50
percent of hip-injury victims can
never return to their prior ways
of living.

According to Cauley, the main
concern of the researchers is to
improve the quality of life of
women and to save the elderly
money. Over $7 billion a year is
spent on osteoporosis in direct
and indirect costs. One-third of
all women will incur an

osteoporotic fracture during their
lifetime.

“[Alendronatel appears to
prevent bone loss. There is reason
to believe it can prevent fractures,
and that's what will be tested,”
Cauley said.

Pitt, along with 10 other U.S.
universities, will screen post-
menopausal women, aged 55-80,
who have not used estrogen and
have low bone mass.

The women will first go through
phone screenings to see if they
See Bones, page 6

Patients admitted to the
program are given a compact
computer diary that records a
series of “yes” and “no” questions
asked of the patient during an
attack. At the onset of an anxiety
attack, the patient simply answers
these questions and the data is
automatically stored in memory.

The second part of this study
involves a monitored walk around
campus. For instance, the patient
is given a map and instructed to

stop at all 10 of the various

Committee formed
to study child care

By Kim Palmiero
Staﬂ" Writer

Founders of Pitt's Coalition for Child Care, ‘ Steve Parks and
Lori Shorr, say that they are satisﬁed with steps taken by Pitt
President J. Dennis O’Connor to explore the possibility of
university child care, but are still planning to remain active in
bringing attention to the importance of the issue.

Recently, the University Child-Care Committee was created
to examine aspects of what university-provided child care
would entail. The committee is made up of faculty members
and students “representing every facet of the university,” Short
said. _ . '

CCCP’s Treasurer Liz Marshall agreed that creating a committee
is a step in the right direction. “From what I’ve seen of President
O’Connor, he’s everything we’ve wanted.”

Currently Pitt does have a child-care center but it is
inadequate to suit the needs of thegrowing number of older
students, according to Shorr.

Parks added, “there are only 100 spots available, and there’s
a huge waiting list.”

CCCP was first initiated last spring in response to problems
Parks and Shorr, who are married, experienced as parents
trying to juggle school and paying for expensive day care. But
it was this September that their membership blossomed. At the
present, they have over 100 members on their mailing list.

Service oﬂers statistical analysis

By Mike Laughlin

Staﬂ" Writer

A statistical—consulting service
has been established for graduate
students who need help inter-
preting statistical information for
their thesis or dissertation.

Located in Thackeray Hall and
currently supervised by Dr. Allan
Sampson, the service was

established by the Center for.

Statistics last fall to provide
statistical support for graduate
students involved in research.
The people who work as statistical
consultants are graduate students
working toward a master’s degree
or a doctorate in statistics.

“It provides them with training
so they can function as better
statisticians in their field,”
Sampson said. He described the
service as a means for statisticians

to gain hands-on experience
before going out into the work
force.

There are currently nine
students working in the service,
although the number varies from
term to term. The consultants
usually begin work at the center
in their second or third year of
graduate school as part of the
Supervised Consulting course.

The service attracts a wide range
of graduate students who need
help in interpreting and
organizing the statistical data
they’ve gathered for their
research. Many are doing research
in such ﬁelds as psychology,
political science, biology,
sociology, education and various
clinical-research areas.

“It helps them interpret their

As for what statisticians do
when they graduate, they are
employed in a number of ways.
They may work in government
agencies, such as the Census
Bureau or the Labor Bureau, or
they may work in research
companies or institutes.

Some statisticians may work in I

pharmaceutical companies to
research drug marketing and
usage. Others may do economic
research for banks and stock
brokers.

Sampson's job as supervisor of
the service is to not only oversee
the work, but to give the
consultants on the job training in
new techniques for statistical

StARlooks:for increased membership

By Alissa Smith
For The Pitt News

Students Against Racism may
need to double its manpower
this month in order to distribute
a questionnaire pin- pointing
the perpetrators of on-campus
racism.

“We have to build our group
up if we're going to get this

V project on its feet," Presidentjoe

Babinsack said to the eight
members who attended Tuesday
night’s meeting.

He relayed problems of
members promising to attend and
participate, but not showing up.

Those who did attend,
volunteered to begin distribution
of the 18 question survey
throughout the University of
Pittsburgh campus.

The survey asks students to
specify their own means of racist
actions ranging from jokes to
actual physical violence.

Other questions have them rate
their feelings of racism on a scale
of 1 to 10 concerning handicap,
national origin, race, religion,
sex and sexual orientation.

It also asks them to rate -the
amou nt of tolerance or intolerance
they have toward roommates,
neighbors, classmates, professors

and those in the
community who are different
from themselves based on any of
the mentioned categories.

StAR hopes to meet with
Resident Directors and have
questionnaires delivered to every
floor throughout the Pitt
dormitories.

Members are also considering
calling on professors of basic
care and intro classes who may
be willing to have students
complete the surveys during their
class periods.

Care
Continued from page 3

The problems which Parks and Shorr experienced, such as
paying $810 a month, are not uncommon. To demonstrate this
point, they created a video which was ﬁlmed to raise awareness
of the child-care issue.

“People were invited to tell their child-care story,” Shorr said.
The video, which is currently being edited, features parents,
many of them Pitt graduate students and faculty members,
talking about their experiences trying to juggle parenthood and
studies.

But more than just parents came to the Connie Kimbo Gallery,
where the video was filmed, according to Shorr. “People came
who didn’t have children and who thought it was a political
issue.” Once edited, the video will be presented to Pitt
administrators.

According to Parks, CCCP presented O’Connor and Provost
Donald Henderson with a proposal outlining aspects such as
“drop-off care, subsidized care, a sliding-scale fee structure,
multiple sites, evening care for CGS students and sickroom
care.”

Shorr added, “This sounds like a kind of utopian vision, but
when you look at what other universities are doing, it really
isn’t.” Although Shorr said she has no problems with the
university right now, and that things are “moving in the right
direction.” Both Parks and Shorr plan to keep CCCP active to
remind people of the importance of the child-care issue.

“We want to see it all the way through. We want to keep it
in the foreground so that people realize that there are needs that
have to be met, and it can also help Chancellor O’Connor in
seeing more of the parents’ side,” Shorr said.

It’s 8 o’clock at night, and you are studying at the Cathedral.
A Pepsi and some fries would make for a great study break.
You could rush to the student union or the fast-food joints
down Forbes Avenue.

Or you could go to the Roy Rogers Tuck Shop on the ground
floor of the Cathedral.

“Most of our customers at night are students and professors
that want something quick and convenient after classes,” said
Dan Hatzala, the night crewimanager at Roy Rogers. “Nothing
too exciting happens very often.”

But Kellie Spaw, a two-year employee of Roy’s, said she likes
it a lot anyway. As a cashier, her duties include waiting on
customers and cleaning the restaurant after closing.

Employees said cleaning Roy’s after closing takes about two
hours. They must sweep, mop and deck the ﬂoors, clean the
shake machine, sanitize the tables, clean the kitchen, stock the
front line and wipe off the stainless steel.

Sounds like a lot of work, but Spaw said Roy’s employees
have “a lot of fun when there is nobody here, but we really do
get our work done.” '

In addition to her job at Roy’s, Spaw is a full—time student.

“Getting all the work done takes efficient time management.
You manage to put yourself in a routine,” she said.

There are close to 25 people who work on the night crew at
Roy’s, about 60 percent of which are students, Hatzala said.

“Roy’s is a wonderful opportunity for students,” Hatzala said.
The pay is above minimum wage-, most of the co—workers are
students and theywork around students’ schedules. Benefits
include freeimeals and paid vacation.

One important qualification for Roy’s employees is good
communication skills. Because Pitt attracts many international
students, employees sometimes have to help them order,
Hatzala said. '

unanimously voted last night to
distribute a survey to all law
students concerning the
installation of an honor system
for taking exams.

“We are not proposing any
changes. We just want to explore
possibilities and initiate dis-
cussion,” SBA member Hugh
McGough said.

At present, law students take
examsunder strict supervision.
“Freedom of movement is
severely restricted in the Law
School during exams,” he said.

The SBA said the high security
surrounding exams is not
necessary.

"I hope an honor system would

home or to meet in a specified
place to take the exam
unsupervised.

The survey will be distributed
next week and will ask questions
such as, “Since entering law
school, have you cheated on an
exam or academic assignment?”
The survey also asks students to
compare Pitt Law's exam policy
to those of other schools they
have attended.

Opinions on the possible
impact of the installation of this
policy are welcomed by ample
room for comments on the survey.
All survey responses will be

that it is the best way of doing it.
He pointed out that respected
law schoolssuch as those at the
University of Virginia, Washington
University and Berkeley have all
instituted honor systems.

After conducting the survey,
the SBA will sponsor a forum
open to all students and faculty
to stimulate discussion and elicit
response concerning the honor
system.

The exact procedures of test

locations. Throughout the journey
the heart rate and level activity
are recorded, and an EEG is
printed for the doctors to examine.

This entire two-part scenario
helps the doctor determine the
necessary treatment needed for
the particular individual.

Participants in the study are
divided into three groups: those
given Prozac everyday, those
given Prozac every other day and
those given a placebo.

The latter will reinforce all
findings. In addition, the patients
as well as the doctor are said to
be “double blind” to the
experiment. This means that

neither the doctor nor the patient
knows who is receiving what

dosage.
Most anxiety patients are
prescribed various anti-

depressant drugs that have side
effects. One such drug, Xanix,
has withdrawal symptoms after a
period of time.

According to Clark, the benefits
of Prozac outweigh Xanix and
Imipramine and in a sense
combines the best features of
both.

He went on to say that the
accusations linking Prozac to
people with suicidal tendencies
is unfounded.

The incidents involving Prozac

were fully tested by the Food and
Drug Administration to reinforce
their evidence. Clark said previous
allegations about Prozac have
made some people apprehensive
about taking this drug, but there
is no causal relationship between
Prozac and those with suicidal
tendencies.

As far as the study, Clark said,
“The evidence to date suggests
that Prozac is effective in
preventing panic disorder, but
it’s still to early to draw any
conclusions."

participating in the panic-disorder
study can receive information by

qualify. If they have the right qualifications, they will have their
bone mass measured at a clinical screening.

The end count will be 6,600 eligible women, 600 from each

location.

“We’ll be recmiting now and hope to have all of our subjects

by the end of this year,” Cauley said.

The eligible women will be split randomly into two separate

groups. The first group will receive the new investigational
medication, and the second group will receive a placebo, an
inactive drug. ,

“The [Food and Drug Administration] requires a placebo-

controlled trial for any investigational medication,” Cauley
said.

The women will be followed for three to four years. If their

Calcium intake is low, they will receive free calcium and
vitamin D supplements, which help strengthen bones.

According to Cauley, the researchers hypothesize that the

women who receive the alendronate will have less
fractures.

The University of Pittsburgh researchers will be doing

screenings at the Mon Valley Community Health
Center in Monessen, Pa., and at the Keystone Building on
campus.

“It’s a major research effort for osteoporosis research and a

major concern for older women. We need more and more
issues,” Cauley said.

Presently there are only two FDA—approved drugs for

osteoporosis on the market.

South of the border

A week cannot go by here at the wonderful, headline-
grabbing University of Pittsburgh without incidents from
our administration of ill—repute.

If the $92,000 installments or a repugnant ROTC decision
could not captivate a bewildered student population,
what can?

This Saturday, President]. Dennis O’Connor, along with
university-related insurance company directors and
university medical staff, will ﬂy off to the warm, sun-
drenched shores of the Grand Cayman Islands for an
annual board meeting.

The stint runs until Wednesday; board meetings will
occupy grueling days of fun in the sun.

Sounds like a good time. Accompanied by their wives,
the boys ﬂy off to this hot—spot Caribbean island.
Apparently, fringe benefits at the university seem only to
improve during these harsh economic times. Some will
stay behind, on their own time and money, for a mid-
winter retreat. '

Under the law the two university-related companies,
Cathedral Insurance and Forbes Re-Insurance, must
conduct business on the Caribbean island where their
charters originate from.

We find the jet—setting action on the part of the
administration in poor taste. While students struggle for
tuition payments, Pitt’s top brass, with all the sensitivity
displayed during the installment and ROTC fiascoes,
continue to give our prominent, respectable university a
bad name.

In the new era of openness, Pitt’s administration will not
comment or, allegedly, allow filming for an upcoming
episode on “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.”

We sincerely hope Dr. O’Connor will get back in time
for his installation. It would be a shame if he missed the
$92,000 hoedown due to bad weather.
Playmg zt safe

Each year millions of sweethearts celebrate a joyous day
of love, Valentines Day. While many may not have found
that special someone by the special day, their luck may
change. . .

One valentine we would like to send out to all lovers is
that if you want to play, make sure your lovemaking is
safe. Thousands of unnecessary pregnancies each year
could be prevented by the use of a condom coupled with
another contraceptive.

Also, considering HIV and sexually transmitted diseases,
it would be wise to discuss sexuality with your partner.
Condoms can provide some reassurance against the
transmission of HIV.

Facilities exist on campus as well as outside the university
to provide information regarding contraceptives, HIV and
sexually transmitted diseases. Please take the time to
consider your choices.

Pitt overlooks hate on campus

I was shocked and disgusted
by the double standard exhibited
in Gary Knapick’s Feb. 6 article,
“College campuses divided on
the issue of ‘hate speech.”’ Even
as he criticizes racist and sexist
incidents on other campuses,
Knapick downplays racial slurs,
vandalism and harassment at Pitt
as “a few minor incidents.” While
“venomously sexist letters” at
SUNY Buffalo are portrayed as
serious problems, here statements
such as “Die faggots” and
swastikas are only “a small yet
undeniable current of hatred."

Wake up. When my office mate
— a black woman for whom I
have great respect — received a
note reading “Die nigger” last
fall, it was no minor incident.

It was a disgusting show of
racism and cowardice which
Knapick himself shows is not
isolated. And according to the
Pitt police, it is a prosecutable
crime which could land the
perpetrator in jail.

The administration should not
“feel grateful for the relative calm
that prevails at Pitt.” It should
take action. We all should.

Students protest installation
I am writing with concern about
the installation ceremonies of our
new president/chancellor, _I.
Dennis O’Connor. Why are we,
the students at Pitt, putting up
with such an outrageous event?
Do we have no other choice but
to sit by while $92,000 is spent on

- one man?

Provost Donald Henderson,
who convened the installation
committee, said that $92,550 is a
“functional budget that permits a
dignified installation of our
president.

To do anything less is
demeaning.” Mr. Henderson, I’ll
tell you what’s demeaning.
Demeaning is paying $500 a
month to live in a roach—infested,
poorly maintained apartment.

Maybe Pitt should follow the
example of other area universities
like Carnegie Mellon and Penn

State. Both of these universities
recently installed presidents and
chose, because of the hard
economic times, not to be ﬂashy
about it.

Wouldn’t it have been better,

  Letters

considering the mistakes of the
former administration, for the
O’Connor administration to‘ put
the money toward something
which directly benefits the
students? I mean —.- don’t get me
wrong — I’d'love to skip class for
some hors d’oeuvres and Pepsi at
the ppen faculty/student
reception, but I’d rather see
money spent on more important
things.

Campus safety, housing
improvements, improved student
health care, improved general
facilities — ‘these are all
improvements that could be made
with this money.

Is it possible to impeach a
president before he's even been
installed?

Multicultural music reviews

I am concerned about a letter
written by Candice, Mason which
was published in the Feb. 4 edition
of The Pitt News.

She says, in reference to the
terms included in Brian Berger's
rap commentary, “I would not be
offended if that was a part of Mr.
Berger’s culture, but it is not.”

The way I interpret this is that
it would be acceptable for an
African American to use these
terms, but it would be wrong for
a white person to speak this way.
Sorry, girlfriend, I don’t think so!

Ms. Mason also found “this
type of commentary racist as
well.” Evidently she is not aware
of the difference between racism
and prejudice. Racism is the
physical act taken against the
other race, whereas prejudice is
the attitude expressed toward the
other race.

Mason states that Brian Berger

“does not share the culture in
which rap music was intended."
So when I, a Caucasian female,
go to Metropol next week to see
Ice-T, will I be denied entrance
because his music is not intended
for me? May I wear an “X” on my
hat, a Nefertiti around my neck or
Triple F.A.T. Goose written across
my hood. or weren’t those things
intended for me?

3- I find Ms. Mason’s letter to be
prejudiced against white people
by saying that she wants an
African American to write the
black entertainment
commentaries. That is like myself
saying that I want an Asian student
to write about the Chinese New
Year. You can't always get what
you want.

Dorm conditions condemned

Forbes Hall is supposed to be
one of the nicest upperclassmen
dorms on campus, but it_is turning
to trash.

On the fifth floor we had a fire
in a hallway garbage can the
other week, and because
someone tampered with the
smoke detectors, the fire alarm
didn't go off.

A lot of damage was caused,
and our lives were endangered.
The fifth ﬂoor has had the glass
from the fire extinguishers
broken, the bulletin board torn
out of the wall [and] the exit signs
stolen, and the washers and dryers
are wrecked.

The ﬂoor just received a note
telling us that we will be billed
for the damages by the end of the
month. I think. that the entire
building should be charged for
these damages, not just the fifth
ﬂoon

Everyone has access to the areas
where the damages occurred, and
I would like to know why the
university thinks we would
tamper with the smoke detectors
and then start a fire when we
could have all been killed.

Contractions aren’t always one’s best option in academic pursuits

It all started with contractions: don't,
can't, shouldn’t, wouldn't. We all know
and use them frequently. But I was told as
a young child that I was forbidden to use
such words in the written language. I was
brought up in a do not, can not, should
not, would not kind of world. The spoken
word and the written word were two
different and distinct things. What I wish
to talk about is the attack that the spoken
word is now making on the written word.

We are a society of speed. Our cars go
faster. Planes takes us to places around the
world. Food comes in a little Styrofoam
(or, hopefully, recyclable paper) container,
and waiting is only reserved for the mail,
the bank and class registration. We rush
from here to there and there to here, never
really stopping to smell the roses before
we trample them in our haste or pave over
them for a parking lot or administrative
building. This is the real problem.

When I learned these contractions, I
was told not to use them in the written

Josh Silverman

word. So where did they end up? Yes, you
guessed it, in the spoken word. Here is
where the problems began. Since society
relies today more on the spoken word
than on the written word, our search for
brevity and speed leads us to speak in a
quicker, more condensed manner. The
point gets across in fewer words than
before. We talk to our friends and family,
taking words that were never meant to be
condensed (such as parents=’rents or
pizza=’za), and speak in the way that we
want to speak. I am not condemning this:
I too wonder if English is not my second
language. But the fact remains that the
spoken word in society has a great
inﬂuence over the written word. We change
our mindframe from a formal-written and
relaxed-spoken style to a relaxed-written
and -spoken style.

It is a vicious circle. We speak in a
condensed manner, which in turn
inﬂuences the written word, and the written
word soon inﬂuences the spoken word. A
downward spiral of grammatical errors
and contractions leads us to something
along the lines of George Orwell’s 1984,
where our language is reduced to just one
word. One word. Probably “like,” at the
rate we are going.

It has been a long and arduous process,
this dismantling of proper English, both
written and spoken. I am not proud to be
a participant in it, and I try to keep myself
at bay when using the written form of our
language. But the written form of English
is battered. It is hurt and vulnerable, and
that is when change takes place.

“Everybody’s going” read a poster on
campus. If I remember correctly, my
grammar rules (shudder) would state that
the sentence above implies that going is a
possession of everyone, much in the same
way that the car is a possession of John in

the sentence,” John's car is red." News
Flash: There is no contraction for “is.” I do
not know why someone would think that.

But it is a new world with new rules. It
is inevitable that since the spoken word is
so much more widely used than the written
word, eventually the written word will be
forgotten. I realize this and fight it.

Who knows? Perhaps one day I will be
able to accept the fact that writing is a
dinosaur and shouldbe forgotten. Someday
I might be able to put “can’t" into my
writing without feeling some sort of grade-
school guilt about it. For now, though, I
will fight the change at every turn, strike
down every error that I see when written
and fix every misuse of what I was once
taught was proper.

But then again, maybe I’m just gonna,
like, kick back, listen to some tunes and,

like, you know, just deal with it.

Fred currency takes Europe

Holy Cow! It's 1992, and no one told me!!

This is the last year that I'll be able to go to Europe for Spring
Break before the European Economic Community (or “Beast
from the East") closes its doors to American products, money
and gullible tourists!

In case you haven't been paying attention in your token
political-science class, the EEC decided a while back that
starting in 1992, its borders would only be open to trade with
the countries that started either World War.

The birth of this huge, 12-headed monster will make life
confusing in one big way come 1999. By then the EEC will have
just one form of currency to play around with, possibly wiping
away all the Deutsche marks, shedding some pounds and
roasting the francs.

Adam Richter

This may seem insigniﬁcant, but just the act of changing to
one form of Eurocash could bring on the next World War. It
sounds a bit extreme, but look at it this way: The EEC has only
seven years to decide what to name its currency, and who to
put on what bills.

This may not seem like a big dilemma, but unfortunatelythe
EEC hasn't been able to solve this problem ——- yet.

First things first. The EEC needs a name for this new money.
Since “Franc” and “Mark” were already taken, I think the EEC
should name its currency something like “Fred.” Skeptics may
argue, though, that there has never been a famous European
named Fred. This is true, but keep in mind there has also never
been a famous American named Dollar. We’ve had a few show
dogs named.“Buck," but no Dollars.

The problems now are what to name all the denominations
of Fred and how to decide who goes on the bills. In the U.S.,
we have things like cents, dimes, nickels, quarters, etc., for
different amounts of money.

A major economic monster like the EEC needs a system that
doesn’t look like it originated by randomly picking words in
the dictionary. To make things really simple, smaller
denominations of Freds should also be called Freds, and the
equivalence will look something like this: 1 Fred = 1 Fred.

I realize it's a complicated system, but in time people will get
used to it. Anyway, the second major snag in the Eurocash idea
is deciding which people go on what bills. In the United States
we have it pretty easy; we just use dead presidents. Since the
EEC has no president yet, we'll just have to go for famous
Europeans. Easy enough, right? Not really. Think about it: If
you were Luxembourg, would you want a famous
Luxembourgean on the I-Fred bill, while the Queen of
England has her mug pasted to the 1,000,000-Fred note?

The key is to strike a balance between all the weaker
countries of Europe and the ones that could send them back
into the stone age (and usually try to every 50 years or so). The
best way to appease everyone is to put one person on all the
bills —— someone everyone likes who isn't at all threatening.

Someone like Mikhail Gorbachev. True, the guy isn't from any
of the member nations of the EEC, but he’s got charm and a
pretty diplomatic face, and he no longer controls the second-
biggest nuclear stockpile in the world. ‘
Besides, he’s one of the few people alive who knows what
“Fahrvergnilgen” really means.

College administrators hacle affirmative
action, undermine American institutions

I don't know how much
knowledge you have about
“political correctness,” but I can
assure you that it is real and it is
a serious menace to a quality
education. I am going to highlight
typical examples of what PC is
and why it is nonsensical and
sometimes . downright
discriminatory.

The presence of affirmative
action as an aspect of PC is a
good example of how an
American tradition, such as hiring
by merit, it tossed by the wayside
by well-inte ntioned but unrealistic
liberals. Opinion polls have
shown that many Americans
oppose affirmative action and
quotas. But colleges, in their rather
typical, headlong rushes into
stupidity, ignore public opinion
when their policies are
formulated. So they practice
draconian affirmative action in
order to produce “diversity.” What
actually happens is not diversity
but heightened racial tension.
Look at the following examples
of what collegiate affirmative
action produces.

Ernest Koenigsburg served on
the University of California at
Berkeley’s admissions board. In
his interview with author Dinesh
D’Souza, he used the example of
a student with an SAT score of
1,200 and a grade-point average
of 3.5. If that student were black,
the probability of admission

_ would be 100 percent. But if the

student was of Asian or white
descent, the probability would
be less than 5 percent.
According to The Chronicle of
Higher Educatiom first-year
students at Ivy League colleges

Gary ,
Housto

have average SAT scores of 1,250-
1,300 and GPAs of close to 4.0.

But many of these schools admit’

minority students with GPAs of
2.5 and SAT scores in the 700-800
range.

At Penn State University, the
preferential treatment for blacks
doesn’t stop with the admissions
process. In D’Souza’s book,
Illiberal Education, he cites the
following:Anyblackstudentwho
maintains a GPA of C to C+
during the school year gets a
check from the school for $580. A
higher average nets black students
$1,160. The kicker is this: The
money is given regardless of
financial need. Other minorities
and whites are ineligible.

You don’t have to be a genius
to realize how blatantly unfair to
whites and other minorities, such
as Asians, these examples are.
But these and other affirmative-
action policies are standard
operating procedures at many,
many colleges. Blacks are actually
demeaned by such actions.
University administrators are
basically telling minorities that
they are incapable of admission
on their own merit, and the
standards must be lowered for
them so the university can meet
arbitrary quotas. This concept
hurts both blacks and whites. But
the quest for “diversity” overrules
sensibility in the minds of
university administrators.

The legacy of affirmative action

doesn’t stop -with admissions.
Dropout rates at Berkeley for
whites and Asians is 25-35
percent. An internal Berkeley

report that showcased affrrmative— A

action students admitted into the
college in 1982 showed that only
18 percent had graduated within
five years. It would be" better for
minority students with weak
credentials to attend schools
where they can compete against
their academic peers and graduate
in far greater numbers. That would
be the most sensible thing to do.

But liberal college administrators 

don’t‘see it that way.
One of the ‘goals of the
proponents of collegiate

affirmative action is to present an ,

environment where people of
different races can intermingle in g
a tolerant atmosphere. But what
happens is totally different. White
and Asian students look around
and see black students with
weaker academic credentials
being admitted while their friends
with stronger credentials were
rejected solely on the basis of
their race. This fosters resentment

to.

Aiken said that he had
intentions of playing with the
pros until his sophomore year of
college. He said that is when he
realized he wanted to be a
professional person instead of a
professional athlete.

He said you cannot be a
professional athlete forever.

Aiken is now a youth marketing
director for Cameron Coca—Cola
and a color commentator for KBL-
TV, in addition to owning his
own barber shop.

He said that his decision to be
a professional person . was
because someone took the
initiative of telling him the
possibilities of education and the
pros.

More people need to take that
initiative, he said.

“Professors need to get to know
[the college athletes] as people,
not jocks,” Sizemore said

Aiken said that too much
emphasis is being put on athletes;
the mind set is not education, but

Eastern Wrestling League by now. An easy match
in this conference is about as rare as a cloudless

Women’s swim team searches for funding

By Brian Gallagher

The Pitt women's swim team
has won 10 consecutive Big East
Conference championships and
graduated nearly every athlete
they have welcomed into the
program. Knowing these

-department would see it in its

infinite wisdom to add funding to
such a successful program — for
such things as a full-time staff
assistant.

This isn’t the case. The women's

team’s only staff assistant is a
graduate assistant. And from
talking to head coach David
Belowich, who would prefer a
staff assistant, he’s quite happy
with his current grad assistant
coach, Chris Choromanskis.
“Chris has contributed greatly
to what we're trying to accomplish
here,” Belowich said. “From

supervision on the deck, she's an
integral part of our team.”

A former swim star at Miami of
Ohio (where she set six school
and two conference records),
Choromanskis is also a graduate

student pursuing a degree in
elementary education. She is
currently student-teaching at the
Falk School.
For the Rochester, N.Y. native,
the two-year graduate assistant
program has been highly
beneficial, in terms of coaching
and school work.

“I’ve enjoyed the coaching
aspect of the ‘ work,”
Choromanskis said. “Especially
this year, I feel confident in how
I can contribute to the team, as
well as how I do in my studies.”

The past two years have been
busy for Choromanskis, to say

the least. The combination of
being a graduate’ student and

more than hectic schedule.

On a typical day during the

Head coach Rollie Massimino
has long been extolled for his
program's sense of family and
the overachieving ethic that
sprung from the 1984-'85 national
championship. Howeverthe past
few years have seen a team loaded
with underachievers and
perplexing coaching decisions.

Looking at the ‘Nova roster this
year, two things become very
apparent to me: experience and
depth. The Wildcats have both,
and those usually add up as
strengths for a successful team.
Massimino has turned them into
detriments.

Take, for example, the point
guard position. It should be said
that I am not exactly a fan of Chris
Walker, but I think he could be
useful at the least. The point spot
has the least depth on the team,
so Daddy Mass rectifies this by
virtually eliminating the position
from his offense. Walker spends
his time on the floor waiting for
teammates to throw the ball to

Knoles
chooses
Big East
swimmers

By Jim Lakely
Sta_[f Writer

This past weekend,
men's head swimming
coach,Chuck Knoles made
his toughest decision of the
year: who would swim and
who would sit out the Big
East Championships later
this month.‘

“It was tough. I hated
that day,” he said.

According to Big East
rules, a coach can field a
team of only 18 athletes,
with divers counting (for
strategic purposes only) as
one—third of a swimmer.
When Knoles posted his
championship list of 16
swimmers and six‘ divers,
senior Matt Porter was not
on it. So he decided to take
action.

“Matt came up and talked
to me and convinced me
thatl had made a mistake,”
said Knoles.’

Matt made his case on
the strength of his 50- and
100-yard freestyle, events
that he is likely to finish in
the top eight and score
valuable points for the
team. But convincing
Knoles was not an easy
task.

“We sat down and we
went through the entire
squad and talked about the
selection process and
hopefully Matt and the
entire team now knows
how difficult it is to take a
fine group of talented
athletes and have to choose

. between them,” Knoles
9 said. _

Knoles is essentially
trading the point total of
freshman divers Scott Ruth,
Chris Mahr and sophomore
Steve Ruth for the potential
performance of Porter.
Knoles is as conﬁdent as
Porter that the decision was
sound.

“There is no doubt in
Matt's mind that he should
have been on the team,”
Knoles said. “He believes
that just as much as the sky
is blue. He believes that I
made a grievous error and
that his name should have
been on that list from point
zero.”

“It boiled down to the
fact that I thought I should
be on the team,” Porter
said. “I thought he didn't
make the right decision but
now he has rectified the
situation.”

Despite Porter’s injury
problems this year, he is

Lady Pam‘/oers bope to send Bucettesci

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

The Pitt Lady Panthers return
home this Saturday for a rematch
with the Seton Hall Bucettes after
a two—game road stint that bore
less—than-pleasing results.

In the first meeting of these
two teams earlier this year, Pitt
came from behind to win 74-69.
The Lady Panthers trailed by as
many as 17 points in that contest
before first-year point guard Carol
Morton canned two clutch three-
pointers to help Pitt climb back
into things.

The scoring load in that game
was carried by three players for
Pitt. Jill Colabrese, Jonna
Huemrich and Erin Maloy all
contributed 18 points apiece.

Since that contest, the two
squads have gone in different
directions. Last time Seton Hall
(12-9 overall, 4-8 in the
conference) entered mired in a
three—game slide. The Bucettes
lost two more after the Lady
Panthers’ handed them their
fourth loss in a row. However
they have now won three out of
their last ﬁve.

The three wins have come at
home against St. John’s, Boston
College and Syracuse. The two
losses ‘came on the road at
Providence and Miami, currently
the nation’s hottest team with a
21—game unbeaten streak. They
were preparing to meet the
national powerhouse Connecticut
in South Orange, N.J.

Pitt (8-14, 4-9), on the other
hand, comes into this game in a
two-game slump, having lost at
Villanova last Saturday, 66-54,
and at Miami on Tuesday by a 79-

64 score. Since their win at Seton
Hall, the Lady Panthers have lost
six out of eight games.

Despite their mark, Seton Hall
and head coach Phyllis Mangina
are not taking the Lady Panthers
hghdy.

“You never can take a game in
this league for granted,” Mangina
said. “I think we’ve been playing
well, and we’ve had some good
practices. We definitely aren’t
looking past this game. Last time,
they did a nice job of hanging in
there. We didn’t play badly, but
they just made key baskets and
grabbed some big rebounds.”

One big difference in the game
this time will be the return of
center Kelley Moore and forward
Tara Stevens to the lineup. Both
missed the Pittsburgh game in
New Jersey while having the ﬂu/
bronchitis. They missed 10 days
of practice and are just now
beginning to get back into the
flow of things.

One player who was a pleasant
surprise to Mangina in Moore’s
absence was first-year center
Dawn Johnson. Johnson lit the
Lady Panthers up 20 points after
getting the start in the first game.
The addition of Johnson as a
possible starter can give the Lady
Panthers ﬁts.

With Turia Ransom functioning
below 100 percent, Pitt must start
a smaller frontline of Jonna
Huemrich (6 feet), Carolyn Miller
(6-3) and Jill Colabrese (5-9).

Kirk Bruce experimented by
starting Ransom in place of
Colabrese and moving her to the
backcourt for Carol Morton,
moving Erin Maloy to the point.

“That lineup was one that we
tried because we felt it would
work well against a team like
Miami,” Bruce said. “Sometimes
you just make changes for
changes’ sake.”

Bruce may want to return
Morton to the lineup based on
her performance in the first
contest against the Hall. In
addition to her two clutch treys,
Morton went three out of five
from the floor, good for 12 points.
The Bucettes realize whatMorton
can do now and hope to ruin any
hopes of a repeat performance.

“We have to focus on Huemrich
and Morton and try and stop
them if we want to have a chance,”
Mangina said.

“[Morton’sl a good player, and
she made those clutch shots to
pull them back in it last time.
Jonna Huemrich’s always
dangerous, and you always have
to try and keep her from really
hurting you.”

The Lady Panthers’ plan is to
try and neutralize the Bucettes’
power inside by trying to speed
up the tempo of the game.

If they can accomplish this,
they hope to tire the Bucettes,
hopefully causing them to commit
turnovers and mistakes that they
normally would not.

If Pitt is to be successful, it must

ever before.

Knoles’ decision was made
tougher because of the
superior talent of this year’s
team. Pitt has, far and away,
the best and deepest squad in
the conference.

“As a coach, I have an
obligation to do the best job

“But in making decisions, I
also have to remember that I
am dealing with human beings,
and I think ultimately, we

Her schedule was compounded

Worst

Continued from page 10
here is that he doesn’t leave
that spot. Defending Walker
isn’t an intellectual chore, if
you get my meaning.

Walker refuses to venture

, into the paint. Since he has the
best ﬂoor vision on the club,
he would be the best distributor
of the ball. But not on this
team. Against Pitt Monday
night, Walker took seven shots
in 30 minutes of virtual
inactivity. All seven attempts
came from that spot at the top
of the key.

A As much as I'd like to credit
Pitt’s defense for not allowing
Walker to penetrate, the stats
show that Walker simply
doesn’t want to go in there
anyway. Walker’s high-assist
game against Big East teams
has been four. He had one
Monday. So let’s see: He.doesn’t
dish the ball as much as he
used to; he shoots from one
spot and still manages to hit

The only place he does
anything good is the free-throw
line, where he is almost
automatic. Unfortunately for
Massimino, shooting guard
Greg Woodard (a famous
contact player) has been to the
line 50 more times this year.

Point guard is a position
which requires efficiency and
leadership. For proof, inst look
at Sean Miller or Georgetown’s

_ Joey Brown orjason Buchanan
of St. John’s. ’

Against Pitt, Brown took
control of the offense, getting
to the foul line, where he put
the game away for the Hoyas.
Miller did the same against
Syracuse to send the
Orangemen away. Walker’s
leadership is non-existent, and
his only talent seems to be
hacking and whining.

The other example of
Villanova’s coaching problems
is Lance Miller, the team's best
player. At 6-foot, 6-inches,
Miller has the skills to post up
and shoot over srnaller players
and can also drive past taller
defenders. Yet Massimino puts
Miller in a cage only slightly
bigger than Walker’s.

In effect, Miller plays the
alleged point—guard position
for Villanova. He is charged

only 38 percent of his shots. 4

with starting the offense and
making entry passes into the
post players. While he can do
this easily because of his size
and passing ability, he is limited
in the number of things he can
do elsewhere. A player like
Miller doesn’t really have a true
position; he can do so many
things. But putting him on top
and preventing him from driving
to the hoop is senseless.
Miller is a slashing, creative

player who is being stymied in_

an offense where the chief
objective seems to be getting to
the foul line. The problem with
this strategy is that post players
tend to draw the most fouls,
and ‘Nova’s post players are
not highly developed,
offensively. So the most talented
player in the offense stands
around waiting for non—contact
forwards and centers like Marc
Dowdell, James Bryson and
Anthony Pelle to bumble
around the paint. Bryson and
Pelle have offensive potential,
but this year the strength is on
the perimeter with players like
Miller, Walker and Woodard.
Hey, I’d like this team to run
a bit more. Players like Miller
and Calvin Byrd are conducive

for a wide—open attack, and the

big men can run the floor pretty
well.

You’ll notice that I haven’t
mentioned Dowdell too many
times. I don’t think I really need
to. Next subject.

Basically, I don’tlike much of
what Massimino is doing with
this team._In 1984-85, he had to
hold the reins for his team,
limiting it because it wasn’t the
most talented team in the world.
But ‘Nova has recruited well
since then, and the talent level
has certainly improved. Yet
Massimino stubbornly refuses
to let his players play. By
tightening the controls on his
offense, Massimino has created
a stand-around look which is
bewildering. Walker may not
deserve better, but Miller
deﬁnitely does.

During Monday's game,
Massimino and Pitt fan Paul
Hipp got into ‘a “discussion”
about some of the fouls that
Villanova was being called for.
That was probably the most
efficient thing Massimino did

all night, for he turned away
from the court and wasn’t
strangling his own offense.

St. John’s visits the Field House
on Saturday, and it should be
interesting. Of course, the
marquee player is Malik Sealy,
but several other Redmen have
stepped up their games.

The first is Hartford transfer
Lamont Middleton. With starting
center Robert Werdann out
recently, Middleton has seen
good minutes at forward after
head coach Lou Carnesecca
moved Shawnelle Scott to the
pivot.

Middleton, with his
characteristic headband, has
caused a few headaches for
opposing teams with his
inspiring inside play. Middleton
is one of those players who isn’t
an offensive marvel but is an
effective offensive rebounder
and can frustrate teams with his
ability to beat a double-team on
Sealy.

The guard rotation has been
shored up by newcomers Derek
Brown and Lee Green, who
aren’t key performers but can
provide quality depth in the
backcourt. In the past,
Camesecca had very few options
if his starters weren’t shooting
well. Now he can turn to Brown
and Green for jumpstarts off the
bench. 8

Like I said, Sealy is the star,
but now his supporting cast is
much better than last year. In
last season's game at the Field
House, Sealy had 27_ points, but
Buchanan was the only other
starter to make more than half
of his shots. The deeper Pitt
team wore out the front line of
the Johnnies, racking up 25 fouls
among the five frontcourt
players. Things should be
different Saturday, although
Werdann’s absence will hurt.

I see that Seton Hall is gaining
a bit in the league. The preseason
hype about Luther Wright and
injuries to several players set
the Pirates back, but they are
rebounding.

Without a powerful inside
game, however, they won't
make too much noise. At 6-7,
Jerry Walker is overmatched
inside against nearly every
opponent, and it hurts the Hall’s
interior defense.

Fitzgerald Field House  
better for fans and team

“Sit down, fat ass!”

This is how the Field House
Fanatics reacted to Villanova
basketball head coach Rollie
Massimino. Rude, offensive and
disrespectful.

Disapprove of the content of
their message all you want; at

least they bring the place to life.
The Fitzgerald Field House has
taken on the atmosphere of a
very tough gym to visit due to the
ever-growing group of fanatics
and its leader/mascot, Panther
Paul.

The word “gym” explains the
problem. Monday night's game
was sold out, but the Field House
holds less than 7,000 fans. This is
the reason some Panther games
are played in the much larger
confines of the Civic Arena. The
given reason is to let more fans

- see the games. It isn’t often

mentioned that it is to make more
money from those fans. You just
knew money was going to come
into play here, didn’t you?

The issue should be what is
best for the team and the fans.
Since they began Big East play in
1982, the Panthers are 92-27 (.770
percent) at Fitzgerald Field House,
and they are undefeated in seven
games there this season.

LECTURE SERIES 1992 g  

Conversely, they are 12-12 at the

Civic Arena, including a 2-1 record

there this season.

Fitzgerald Field House is easier
to get to for Pitt students. Student
fans should get priority when a
university team is involved.

Both fans and players are better
served by the atmosphere at the
Field House. The fanatics may be
a bit rude, but they are into the
game. Instead of the usual, boring
booing of opposing players as
they are announced, the fanatics
greet them with short insults,
such as “Who’s he?" “Who cares?”
and my personal favorite, “You
suck!” They greeted Massimino
with a chant of “Rollie’s fat." They
got creative with some players.
The musical talents of Villanova
guard Chris Walker were featured
on television this past week, so
fans asked him to sing or play
them something. They informed
Anthony Pelle, whose name
resembles that of a great soccer
player, that he was playing the
wrong sport. Even the Wildcats
seemed to enjoy the jibes of the
fans.

The team really does seem to
get a spark from fan reaction.
This year's edition of the Panthers
includes some very emotional
young, players, like Orlando
Antigua, Jermaine Morgan and
fan—favorite Eric Mobley. After

Arena games for money

' By Brad Quatchak
For The Pitt News

Money. That one word could be the answer for nearly every
question surrounding professional sports today. Butwhat about
collegiate athletics? Certainly collegiate athletics aren’t being
poisoned by that ugly word. Think again!

Lets play a quick game of Jeopardy. One question for all the
marbles. Answer: For money This one is easy. Question: Why
do the Pitt Panthers play basketball at the Civic Arena?

Here are the facts: Pitt’s lifetime record at the Civic Arena is
34-36 —- less than spectacular numbers, wouldn’t you say? On
the other hand Pitt hoops has an impressive record in recent
years at Fitzgerald Field House. Over the past several years Pitt
has compiled a record of 27-2 at “the House." The only te_arn to
beat the Panthers at Fitzgerald has been the University of
Connecticut. ‘

Sure, most of Pitt’s opponents at the Arena over the years have
been top-notch opponents (disregard Duquesne). On the other
hand Pitt doesn't exactly play slouches at the Field House either.

The only reason you see Pitt playing games at the Arena is
because they draw a larger crowd, thus drawing more
revenue.Let’s say that Pitt begins playing all of their games at the
Civic Arena, which is what the administration’s ultimate goal
probably is. Taking into consideration Pitt’s previous record at
the Civic Arena, they will lose more games than they win. This
will result in poor recruiting, worse teams, less fans and
ultimately less MONEY!

Ask the Pitt basketball fans where they would prefer to watch
a game. Better yet, ask the Pitt players and coaches where they
prefer playing. I guarantee the answer will be Fitzgerald Field
House.

If anyone in Pitt’s decision-making processes was in attendance
at Monday night's game, the writing would be on the wall. Keep
the games at the Field House.

somebody in a lower weight class
to step up and produce points.

“It’s important that somebody
down below comes through for
us,” Stottlemyer said. “One of
those first three or four weights
have to come through. We can’t
go into 150 without a win, then
expect to win the last five
matches."

Against Edinboro, this should
not be as critical, but someone

must spark the Panthers. T he

man to look to here could be
junior Bobby Simpson (5-3-
1),who will be at either the 118-
or 126-pound slot.

Clarion enters the meet with an
11-4 mark, 2-2 in EWL action
with losses to third-ranked Penn
State and West Virginia and wins
over Edinboro (23-19) and
Bloomsburg (28-11).

Like the Panthers, the Golden
Eagles own a victory over ﬁfth-
ranked Ohio State and have also
knocked off 12th-ranked North
Carolina State and 13th-ranked
Cornell.

Head coach Bob Bubb said he
feels his squad has responded
very well to the demands of a
rigorous slate.

“We’ve had our hands full,"

Bubb said. “With the degree of‘

diffuculty of our schedule, we’re
very pleased with the way we’re
wrestling.”

The Golden Eagles boast a
powerful, balanced lineup
anchored by their two-time All-

American, heavyweight Kurt
Angle. Angle, from Mt. Lebanon,
is 17-0 and still ranked No.1 in
the nation. He won the National
Championship two years ago as a
sophomore, then lost in the
national ﬁnals last year. Angle is
a three-time EWL Champion with
a career EWL record of an
overwhelming 20-1, tieing him
for second place on the league’s
all-time win list. He has racked
up 78 career EWL scoring points,
ranking him 17th on the EWL
career list. In addition, Angle has
already beaten top national
contenders in the heavyweight

division: Arizona State’s Mike.

Anderson, 3-2, and N.C. State’s
Sylvester T erkay, 7-5, at the Penn
State Duals.

Lately, Angle has been banged
up with various injuries, but Bubb
said he expects him to be ready
for the showdown with Pitt’s fifth-
ranked Perry Miller (18-2).

This will be a rematch of last

March's EWL title match, a 2-1
overtime win for Angle.
' The match remained
deadlocked at 1-1 through not
only the regular three periods but
in the sudden-death overtime as
well. _

Miller said he has been looking
forward to this match for quite a
while. '

“We go way back. We were in
the same region in high school,”
Miller said. Miller attended
Greensburg-Salem High School,
while Angle was at Mount

Lebanon High School.

“It’s just another match — that’s
the kind of attitude I have to
keep,” Miller said.

Another key man for Clarion is
142-pounder John Dasta, a
returning EWL champion. He won
the 134-pound class last season
and has looked strong again this
year. Senior Erik Burnett gives
Bubb a strong start at 118. Burnett,
of Oberlin, Ohio, has a career
EWL mark of 12-5-1 and was
named the EWL’s Wrestler of the
Week for Jan. 20. Junior Steve
Krouse is solid at 134 with a
career EWL mark of 10-1-2. What’s
more impressive is that Clarion
lost one of its key wrestlers, 150-
pounder Moss Grays, to a
shoulder injury early in the season.
Two young wrestlers have picked
up the slack. First-year man Paul
Antonio will not wrestle against
Pitt due to injury, so sophomore

Darin Roth will be the man. Bubb ‘

said he has been pleased with
Roth’s effort.

“He’s fit the bill pretty well.
He’s hard-nosed; he scraps real
well for us,” Bubb said.

Pitt realizes the potencyof the
lineup it will face. Panther All-
American Scott Hovan said the
team is excited for Clarion but
will not look past Edinboro.

“I want to just focus on that
meet first,” Hovan’ said.
“Obviously, Clarion’s a much
bigger meet for us. It’s probably
our biggest home match of the
year, and I know a lot of guys are
fired up.”

Junior Sean Gibbs is one of the
leaders as the Panthers strive for
the finish.

“Earlier in the year, coach
Istottlernyerl had to push. Now
guys are starting to realize what
they have to do, because guys
are starting to realize they’re
getting down to the end of the
road,” Gibbs said.

Buncher

Continued from page 13
Monday night with 15 points,
nine rebounds and three blocked
shots, Mobley was asked why the
team does so well in the Field
House.

V “I guess it’s just the crowd,”
Mobley said. “They are right there,
by the floor. It makes you feel a
lot better knowing you have the

_ crowd right there.”

This is a change from the past.
Fitzgerald Field House was not
very loud last year, but the
beginning of a fan group has
changed that. It is easier to scream
your head off if you are in a
group of people doing the same
thing. 

“It used to be quiet here last
year,” Mobley said. “I sat in here
last year and said, ‘This is college
basketball in the Big East? It
shouldn’t be like this.’ This year I
think everybody is starting to get
into it a little more.”

The only way to take advantage
of that new involvement is to
keep games in the Field House.
Panther head coach Paul Evans
has said that he would like the
team to play all of its games in
one place. I think the fans at the
game stated the solution very
well. i

“No more arena games! No
more arena games!”

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, February 13, 1992

 

. By Mike Shanley _,

Sta_[/‘ Writer

Not many of jazz music’s true
innovators are still out there
breaking new ground. Ornette
Coleman is one of them, and this
Friday he and his band Prime
Time are returning to Pittsburgh
for their first area appearance in
10 years.

Since he exploded on to the

I jazz scene in 1959, Coleman has

always been at the center of
controversy. llis original quartet
——— Don Cherry on pocket trumpet,
Charlie lladen on bass, Billy
Higgins on drums and Ornette on
his plastic alto saxophone —
moved away from the bebop style
of the time, basing the song
structure and solos on the
melodies rather than the harmonic
structures. In doing this, the
musicians had the freedom to let
their music go wherever they
wanted, without the confines of
Chord changes.

Years later, Coleman gave his
innovations the name “harmo-
lodics,” basing it on the beliefthat
each note that can be played has

within itself the echoes of three
other notes. At the time his music
was handed the title “free jazz,”
based on the amount of freedom
the players had. It came from the
title of a Coleman album.

This new and unusual sound

met with equal amounts of praise
and hatred. Composer-conducter
Leonard Bernstein saw the
quartet’s debut at New York’s
Five Spot and raved. Some jazz
musicians called Coleman a
talentless charlatan. There were

even stories about musicians
who were so shocked by the
music that they smashed
Coleman’s horn in protest.
But Ornette persevered,
releasing several classic albums
on Atlantic Records that some
say were the biggest innovations
jazz had seen since the days of
Charlie Parker and Louis
Armstrong. Even the albums’
titles gave declarative
statements: 7792's /5 Our Music,
7739 Shape of jazz to Come and
Change of the Century.
Arguably the best-known
album of the time was Free jazz,
on which the Coleman Quartet
was augmented by a second
quartet consisting of bass
clarinetist Eric Dolphy,
trumpeter Freddie Hubbard,
bassist Scott LaFaro and
drummer Ed Blackwell. The
album consisted of a loosely
structured, 36-minute group
improvisation. The level of
group interaction proved that
these musicians had mastered
their instruments. '
Looking at this music 30 years
after the fact, it is hard to wonder

what all the controversy was about.
Unlike other avant gardists of the
time, like Cecil Taylor or Albert
Ayler, Coleman’s music is usually
very bright and never loses sight of
the rhythmic pulse. His song,
“Ramblin," is at least as bouncy and
happy as Charlie Parker’s “Now’s
the Time.”

Although Coleman was searching
for a new style, it was never his
intention to be avant garde just for
avant garde’s sake. “All I wanted to
do was write music that people
would like,” he said. ‘‘I always told
people I was commercial because I
was the only person doing what I
was doing. Obviously I was crying
in the wilderness."

But recognition did not come
right away. Atlantic released him
after seven albums due to weak
sales. This did not deter Coleman,
who began exploring different
musical styles by writing string
quartets, woodwind quintets and
symphonic works. One woodwind
quintet, “Forms and Sounds,” was
released on RCA’s Red Seal label in
1968. When he later signed with
Columbia Records in the ’70s, the
label released his suite, “Skies of
America, ” performed by the London
Philharmonic.

After a retreat during the mid-
’60s, Coleman got together some
new groups, which conﬁised even
more listeners. He began playing
trumpet and violin in addition to
his alto. Some of his albums also
featured the drumming of his son,
Ornette Denardo Colemanjr, who
was not even in his teens at the
time.

In 1975, after another brief hiatus,
Coleman came back with the electric
harmolodic funk band Prime Time,
showing that there was no limit to
the dimensions of his musical ideas.‘

Along with Ornette and Denardo,‘

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, February 13, 1992

By Jason Hillman
Photography Editor

He’s the drummer man. Joe

Harris, native of Pittsburgh and ,

drummer extraordinaire, stars as
himself in the Kuntu theater’s
presentation of Clean Drums.

“I’ve got all kinds of rhythm,”
Joe declares at the beginning of
the show. He proceeds to prove
it. He does every kind of rhythm,
including some Beethoven.
“Rhythm is my business,” he says.
It’s more than his business. it is
his domain. But his love is jazz.

What Clean Drums has to offer
to its audience, above all else, is
a great taste of jazz. The play is
set up like a rehearsal with a
trumpeter (Pete Henderson), a
saxophonist (Todd Ledbetter), a
pianist (Spencer Bey), a bassist
(Herb Marshall), a singer (Cheryl
A. Walker, who doesn’t sing
much) and, of course, Joe.

Near the end of the first act, the
band is joined by the characters
of Not Really Sarah (Vaughn),
played by Denise Sheffey; Not
Really Dinah (Washington),
played by Felicia Gwinn; Not
Really Lena (Horne), played by
Maria Becoateslﬁey; and Not
Really Billie (Holiday), played by
Rema Webb. While the musicians
are arguing about music,
specifically free—form versus
traditional jazz, they summon
these four singers through their
instruments.

Unfortunately, the show was
plagued with technical problems.
The fog machine that was used
for some of the dreamlike
sequences tended to blow out
into the audience, making it hard

mikes working, the women’s
voices couldn’t compete with the
band. Only one number,
“Unforgettable,” sung by Gwinn,
survived without the mike giving
out.

The “Unforgettable” number
had the right balance between
the voice and the band. Gwinn
belted out a soulful rendition that
gave me chills. All of the singers
have great voices, and if all
microphones were working, the
experience would be
mesmerizing.

Over 50 percent of the play is
music, or at least it seems that
way. lnterjected between the
musicial numbers is some
interesting dialogue. 'l'he free-
form-versus—traditionaI conflict is
one ofmany subjects brought up.
Selling out (“Sometimes you can

ﬂy/(«Q42/—

let your integrity suffocate in your
new shoes”), white artists taking
credit for music by black talent
and the way black men treat
black women were some of the
themes brought up in the show.
The dialogue seems to give the
music a certain depth that wasn’t
noticeable when the music stood
by itself.

Joe Harris and many of the
musicians are not actors, and at
times it shows. There were a few
long pauses when lines were
forgotten, but it happened far
less often than it did during the
preview performance last

Saturday. 'l‘hat bodes well for
later performances, when the
musicians get warmed up to the
idea of acting.

frequent — always ordering a half

I The store owner ﬁercely ponders
adulterous murder, and the store
cop is strangely reminiscent of
Ronald Reagan. He, like everyone
else in Aurora, banters with Wayne
in Wayne ’s lingo. “No way," Wayne

 

Near the middle of a
consistently funny Wayne's
World, the evil capitalist
Benjamin (Rob Lowe) tries to
5 convince Garth (Dana Carvey) to
sell out Wayne's World. Garth is
geeking out on a mechanical arm
' and becomes jittery, then
. responds to Benjamin's
suggestion in a clear, almost
’ robotic voice, “We fear change.”
The arm goes nuts, and Garth has
to subdue it with a hammer,
pounding it into submission.
Not only do Wayne (Mike
Meyers) and Garth fear a change
" from their strip-cruising/heavy-
metal/donut-eating existence, but
their entire environment does.
 One of the highlights of Wayne's‘
 ‘‘ Worldis Aurora, lll., a suburb of
 Chicago formerly mentioned only

“Wayne's World” skit on “Saturday
Night Live.” Aurora is the perfect

seems even police watch public-
access cable at 10:30 Friday night.

But more important is the feeling
of Aurora, a nameless, purposeless
suburban angst. In the best quote
of the film, Wayne says, “I thought
I had mono for an entire year, but
it turned out I was just bored.” The
suburbs have their own cultural
vocabulary, which separates them
from the city. When Wayne tries
out his dream Stratocaster in the
guitar store, he plays the first few
chords of, naturally, “Stairway to
Heaven.” The assistant stops him
and points to a sign on the wall,
which says, “NO ‘Stairway to
Heaven!”’

It's not too rich, not too poor, Wayne and Garth (Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey) battle the evil likes of Rob Lowe in Wayne’s World. on to the Camera and audience

trouble. Totally Pauly is totally real and not half as 

weasely as he thinks he is. Check out this interview;
you’ll see why. ‘

D.C.: What's your concert all about?

P.S.: I don’t really have an act. I’m just gonna say,
‘Check out a video every five seconds.’

D.C.: I'm so sure you don’t have any stuff planned!

P.S.: No, I got all new stuff, like a list. Like a music band
would have a play list of songs. I got a play list of bits,
you know. Like different things that I want to talk about
on the stage.

D.C.: Sorry [I woke you]. Did your publicists call and
tell you that someone was trying to get a hold of you?

P.S.: I didn’t get to talk to her. I I

D.C.: You don’t like_ to have your time monitored?

P.S.: Well, I like to have time for myself, you know, and
do stuff. I had to get rubbers and stuff. For the road, you
know? ' - ,

D.C.: (laughing) Uh, huh. You talk about the importance
of using condoms. Did you say, “If you're gonna glaze the
doughnut, you’ve got to Trojan the wood?”

P.S.: I think it’s really important.

broke out into hysterics more
than once in response to the
absurd reality of a proposal and
exploiting its downl"alls: taking
on someone else's identity, the
anxiety that comes along with a
commitment and proposing not
because you are in love but
because you’re getting too old.

and one actress. The father, Ivan
Vassilevitch Lomov, was played
by Chip Norwood. He
encapsuled the mannerisms of
this constantly babbling, silver-
haired, old man. In the
establishing scene Lomov is
talking to (Ihubukov, played by
Dominic: Conti, about a proposal.
Chubukov asks for l.omov’s

blessing to marry his daughter,
Natalya, played by Colleen
Madden.

'l'he play gets sticky when the
three characters begin bickering
about the. ownership ol‘ Uxen
Meadows, a piece oi" land in
between their properties. It is
immediately followed by another
dispute that deals with who has

the better dog. These arguments
symbolize the sacrifice of
individuality that occurs in a
marriage. Natalya and Chubukov
experience complications when
it comes to meshing their
identities.

Wedding

Continued from page 5-6
particularly Madden in her role of Natalya. She plays the part
to the ludicrous limit when she throws her tantrums and rolls
around on the floor during the brawls that erupt between the
three of the.m.

Overall, the play was excellent. But ifyou are contemplating
marriage, it may produce some second thoughts. However if
you were or are married, you will definitely get a huge laugh
out of it.

After a 20-minute intermission, ’/he Wedding, directed byjon
Cantor, takes place.

The establishing scene shows the bride and groom, joined
with their family and friends, sitting in the middle of their living
room.

The actors face the audience from a bridal-party table, just
like at a real reception.

The play demonstrates the plight of newlyweds and coincides
it with intervening family and friends. The slapstick comedy
looks at marriage through the fresh eyes of a young couple.
Everything is new and innocent. As the play progresses, it
depicts society by having the furniture crumble, displaying
infidelity and jealousy, and by having the bride pregnant.

The colorful diversity of characters was about the only thing
this play had going for it. ’/be Wedding consisted ofthe groom’s
father, who told long, disgusting stories; the bride’s mother,
who was obsessed with serving food; the bride’s sister, who
was constantly dealing with sexual advances from her date; an
older, married couple, which had grown apart; and a perverted
friend of the groom. '

The acting in this play is not as fine-tuned as that in Marriage
/’ro/)o‘sal. The mother, played by Leah Lynn Toskin, and the
father, played by Carl Konrad Flanigan, were the only parts that
got my attention. It was too bad they had such minor roles. The
play became tedious after the first 15 minutes, and there were
even some yawns spotted in the audience.

The plays run through l-‘eb. 22 at The Pit, located on Bouquet
Street in Oakland. So if you want to treat a Valentine to a night
of comical theater, this is the place to be. And remember:.After

the proposal, it plunges downhill.

Wayne

Continued from page 5-4
the movie — and the lives of
Wayne and Garth ——.- take on a
repetition that seems almost
incestuous. They live of f “Twilight
Zone” and “Bohemian Rhap-
sody.” They zone on the hood of
Garth’s Pacer (the “ Mirth mobile”)
near the airport runway, and,
while waiting for a jumbo jet to
fly scant hundreds of feet over
their heads, they “whistle” (even
though their lip—synching is
purposely off) just like cowboys
used to do in the westerns of
their childhood. Wayne muses
about the two “Bewitched” dads
(Dick York and Dick Sargent).
He says, “Hey, wait! ‘Sargent.’
‘York.’ ‘Sergeant York.’ ism that
weird?” as iffinding a new way to
split an atom.

Wayne and (Earth find meaning
in everything, even when it’s the
same old filler that means nothing
at all. Watching them is always
hilarious but at times a little
discomforting, hitting a little too
close to home.

whole town tries to kill me
because of the way I look.

D.C.: Well, you’ve said you like
“farm girls” the best. Why is that?

P.S.: God, I just like to get out
of L.A. I hate this town so much.
I mean, I like everywhere I go,

but I don’t like to be in one spot

for so long.

D.C.: Well, you don’t [stay in
one spot] for your show [“Totally
Pauly”]. Don't you roadtrip all
around?

P.S.: Yeah! That’s why I’m
happy to be on the road again. I
just like dealing with people that
are cool and that are normal. I
hate people that are, like, all in
my face and phony.

D.C.: I watched you on KROC
[on location at a California radio
station] this week. Just the other
day you were scamming on a girl
[on the radio];

P.S.: (laughing) Well, she started
it!

D.C.: She [said she] was in love
with you. Do all the girls dig you?

P.S.: (laughing) I don’t know. I
don’t know why, if they do. I
mean, look at me!

D.C.: But you tagged yourself
“the Weasel,” though.

P.S.: That’s probably why they
like me: ‘cause I’m a bad boy.
The Weasel’s what’s up. You
always kind of weas’ around.
Everyone’s a weasel. T hat’s what
I think people are like. They're
always trying, “Hey man, I'm on

I’m a bad boy. The Weasel’s what’s up.

 ’

the list, you know?” Or like, “Hey,
do you want to cruise back to my
pad? I got the house solo." You
know. They're just trying to weas’.

D.C.: Brigid [one of Pauly’s
publicists] told me you were
editing at Disney.

P.S.: Yeah. I was meeting with
my writer for Son In Law and I
was looping [rerecording
dialogue] for the next Kid n’ Play
movie.

D.C.: Really? How do you like
working with them?

P.S.: They’re great. They’re cool.

D.C.: You ’ve always said you ’ve
always wanted to be a comedian,
and you’ve been a “comedy
sponge” since you were nine.
What advice would you give
people who want to get into the
entertainment business?

P.S.: Don’t. [Especially] if you’re
a girl. Because it’s just the worst,
you know what I mean? I'm like
a saint compared to the guys that
live out in L.A. Oh, they're the
worst. It’s pretty sad, you know.
I feel really sorry for a lot of girls
that come out there.

It’s like, every girl in that town

D.C.: How about other

D.C.: Your mother owns the
Comedy Stores. She must have
