Monday, Mar. 31 ,
” _By MURRAY CHASS

Allegheny County Coroher
and Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Dr, William D. Mc-
Clelland will speak to Univer-
sity students Monday, Mar.
31.

McCle1land, who is one of three
nominees for his party's candidate
for Governor of Pennsylvania, will
be brought here by the Allied Col-

legiate Party to address students
in the Student Union Ballroom,

- starting at noon.

Bert O’Malley, party cam-
paign manager and SGA presi-
dential candidate, commented

on the presentation of McClel-
land. “We are pleased to see the
ﬁne response to the program of
presenting political speakers on
the University campus.”

“We are happy to continue this
program by bringing one of Pitts-
burgh’s outstanding Democratic
leaders before the students.”

Mark Elovitz, AC candidate
for vice president of Student
Government Association, said,
“Dr. Mc~Clelland’s appearance
after the election of Mar. 26
should clear up any doubts in
the minds of the voters that the
Allied Collegiate Party plans"to
function throughout the year.”
\McClelland is currently in his
ﬁfth consecutive term as County
Coroner. Each time both he and
Mayor David Lawrence, one of his
primary opponents, ran for their
srespective ofﬁces, McClel1and

VUI To Sponsor

Leader Critic

By MILLARD AMDUR

The United Independent
Party has invited Roy 13. Fur-
man, to speak on Friday at
noon in the Student Union
Ballroom. ‘

Furman is‘ a candidate for
governor of Pennsylvania and is
presently Lieutenant Governor.

He will speak on a subject per-
taining to state and campus poli-
tics.

Furman is a native of Greene

County, Pa. He has been Lieu-
tenant Governor since 1954, and

State House of Representatives.
For one of these terms he was
House Speaker.

Jim Pomarico, U1 candidate for

,lVIen’s Council president, has stat-
Led: “Bringing the Lieutenant Gov-

tiernor to Pitt in the second of our

series will enable the students to
hear proposals from an opposing
candidate for governor."

Lois Capin, party candidate

remarked: “I 119392 that every-

‘ one who turned out for our first
assembly will attend the Fur-
man lecture.--”

Furman has been an outspoken

tion. The UI party will announce

 on Monday the program for the

remainder of its campaign.

Trimester

Advance

Sent To All Students

All students have been sent a deﬁnitive letter on tri-

mester profiram.

In this letter; questions which students raised in dis-
cussion groups throughout the campus are summarized and

answered.

The trimester calendar committee has announced its in-
tention to report ﬁndings ‘K0 tile.‘--~—~'----r‘-‘~'~

chancclior in early April, and ad-
vises comments or suggestions
from students to be submitted
soon to be considered.

The committee was appoint-
ed last October to study the
feasibility of at trimester calen-
dar. Of the several calendar
patterns being considered, the
one published in the faculty
brochure and student letter is
as follows: Autumn trimester,
°Septembcr 8 to December 2-3,
1958; Winter trimester, January
5 to Atari) 18, 1958; and Spring
trimester, April 2'? to August 8,’
1959. I

Students would not be re-
quired to attend all three tri-
mesters and would be considered
full time students attending two
of the three. Students will NOT
be required to reapply after
staying out a trimester.

Credits from this University
would have the same transfer
value they do now. The calendar
“would not be instituted . . . ex-
cept on the this basis.”

Special arrangements are plan-
ned for education, engineering,
and professional programs to in-
sure. fulﬁllment of special require-
mcnts.

A new point raised by the tri-
mester committee is that 21 spec-
ial summer study session for
tezichers would be scheduled. This
would enable public school teach-
ers to continue attendance at the

   last (all On Trimester

It is now the time for getting in last licks on the tri-

, Inester plan“before it goes to a ﬁnal vote.

Last chance letters have been sent to all students and

«their parents with the ready-answered-questions that the’

committee has prepared. ' he i ‘*

The value of sending such letters seems somewhat ques-
tionable in the light of the fact that the committee has al-
ready outlined arguments against opposition to the plan in
these‘ answers. »

It is also of dubious worth to ask for further criticism at
such a late date when the greater bulk of the report for
trimesters must »(for time’s sake) be in advanced or ﬁnal
-form. ‘ “

Several heartening statements are included in the let-
ter, however. ‘ ‘ l ,

The first and probably most signiﬁcant of these is that
which states that the proposed calendar is only one of “sev-
eral”that are being considered. ' .

Of course, the time—honored grain of salt must be ap-
plied‘ to this statement since only one of these several cal-

,endars""was presented to faculty, students, and admini_stra-

tion.
This doubt is furthered bylthe recent printing of this
single calendar in the New York Times Magazine Section.
Such national interest is rare in cases where academic pro-
grams are still in the stage of “studying feasibility.”
Another point that is particularly enlightening is that
which states that, “students would have, under thetrimes-
ter plan, essentially the same choice of courses in any tri-

The well—known catch—word “essentially” is present and
again detracts from the complete credibility of the state-
ment. '

A ﬁrm generality is made in answer to the question of
a possible handicap which could exist if students were to
enter the business world at an earlier age.

The committee reports that “Employers will welcome
trained recruits in the younger age brackets, especially if
they bring a combination of liberal and professional educa-
tion.” '

It seems strange that prospective employers were not

asked to document such a flat statement.

The committee does reason that a slump in manpower
between_the ages of 25 and 45 will show up in the next sev-
en years but no indication of the size of the ‘decrease is
given. ' — V

To this is added the fact thatpjobs are t-ight and getting
tighter and unemployment is still increasing. But the com-

5 mittee reports that an “acute shortage of manpower in the

younger age brackets IS DEVELOPING.”

, Such arguments being impressive or not, it is obvious
from the recent stadium proposal that the Chancellor, who
will receive the report soon, will not accept a decision by
the committee but merely its report.

So there may be time yet for a few inﬂuencing whacks
at the program to get it into shape. It is certainly everyone’s
duty to «make the committee aware of his objections if he
hasian . At :least it,’s,worth aptry. *«  - ~ *

By Millalrd Amdur A
The Soviets are.not lax in the distribution of
scientiﬁc literature tothe “masses” anymore than

they are behind in’scientiﬁc ‘accomplishment.
A new booklet entitled Interplanetary Travel

by A. Sternfeld is an erudite explanation of present

theory and future possibility on the laymen’s level.
It is a translation from the Rus- I
sian pamphlet which appeared ip
Moscow, Fall 1957, prior to
Sputnik. _ ,

Contrary to the latest Amer-
ican view that the Soviets are
knowledgeable in the scientiﬁc
ﬁeld but in humanities are lack-

ous references to mythology and
the literature of many lands.

This booklet is published by
Imported Publications and Prod- .
ucts in New York City which features a whole
group of itranslations of popularized scientiﬁc in-
formation from Russia.- ‘

Others in the series are .f‘Konstantin Tsiolkov—
sky, Father of the Sp‘utniks,” D. I. Mendeleyer,
“Author of the Fundamentals of Chemistry,” “A
World We Do Not See, My Path In Science,” and
“In The World Of Isotopes.” A

Although .the writer cannot vouch for the sci-
entiﬁc accuracy of the information contained, it\is
presented in a manner oddly reminiscent of Sci-
entiﬁc-American.

. Topics Varied

Topics discussed within the volume are the
spaceships proper and problems of escape velocity,
the rocket, prototype of the spaceship, and possi-

ibilities of its’ further adaptation to spacecraft.

The problem of design of the ship, the take off,
the ﬂight, life on the spaceship, dafngerspof space
ﬂight, and descent areintegral parts of the volume.

_ The story of the sputniks condensed is included

with a notation stating: f‘The designing of the
Earth’s artiﬁcial satellite has reached the stage per-if
mitting to launch it in the next two or three
years.” This was released a few months before the
actual launching. ‘ . —
The booklet explains the purpose of the ﬂying-
manned observatories. In order to ease the observa-
tion of the Earth’s surface, Russia will launch the
observatories over the Earth’s poles. ’-

    



Every 24 hours the satellite.would make sixo -

. teen complete revolutions around the earth. It

would be possible to photograph the entire surface
in daylight. .

At low speeds, Sternfeld contemplates, the gen-
trifugal force would be negligible, but when the

speed reaches 7.9 _kilo’meters per second the cen--4

trifugal force equals the force of gravity and neu-
tralizes it. ’ A

Escape Speeds Listed .. ~

Thus the ﬁrst astronautical speed is reached.
The article‘ continues that, were it not for air re-
sistence, the satellite could revolve indeﬁnitely. 

The parabolic speed of 11.2 kilometers per sec-
ond at the earth’s surface would release the body
from‘ the gravitational pull. This is also known’ ac-
cording to the booklet as the escape velocity
second astronautical speed. \ ‘ .

Finally, it” is noted that a speed of not less than
16.7 kilometers per second is required to‘ set a body
free from pull of earth and sun and‘to permit
it to leave the solar system. 

The use of nuclear propellants is the subject of
alprotracted discussion mentioning the technical
difﬁcultiesof high temperatures pressure and radio-
active radiations. '

. Few references are‘ made to the Soviet use of

the realms of space with the exception that the»
“Soviet people . . will extend the domain in
which human reason reigns over the elements.”

Let us hope human reason willbe their guide
\in their exploitation of the new territories.

. , Routine is non-existant
Mrs. Pickering, Miss Hope Give Aid
To Students, Visitors In Info Room

By JOANNE DOLINAR
A routine day at the Information Desk is non—existent.
So say ‘Mrs. Elma Pickering and Miss Helen Pope, host-

esses in charge of the desk.

Each day they ‘must contend with a large variety of

,, questions from students and visitors, such as “How_ many

steps are there in this building?” “May I borrow some scotch

tape?” or “Could you please tell¢

.me where tonight’s lecture on’ dia-
betes is being held?”

Questions Puzzle Hostesses

When answering the phone, the
hostesses are prepared to answer
anything from a jack—pot ques-
tion on a quiz show to whether or
not the husband of the distraught
woman on the other end of the
line is really enrolled »in night
school.

Not long ago, Miss Hope re-
vealed, she was confronted with
a student who would not say a
word, but only gesticulated
strangely. After her attempts to
understand what he was trying
to get across failed, he took a
slip of paper and wrote “How
many seats,are in the Pitt Sta-
dium?” ‘ ‘

Miss Hope realized that ‘this boy
was a fraternity pledge with the
task of obtaining this information
without any verbal communica-
tion. Obligingly, Miss Hope wrote
the desired information on_ the
slip of paper and with a smilerthe
pledge left.

The hostess also told the story
of a man who approached the desk

and asked for the office of a cer—_

tain professor. The name was un-

familiar, so she looked it up in

the directory. It was not listed.
When she explained this to him,

the man became indignent and in-

Cornell Wins E IWA;
Panthers Place Fifth

By JIM LACEY _
Cornell’s talented wrestling team easily won the team tro-
phy in the 54th EIWA Tournament at the,Field House last
Friday and Saturday. It was the Big Red’s 13th title after a

lapse of 28 years.

Behind Cornell’s 64 point total come Lehigh, the pre-

tournament favorite with 49 points. Syracuse ﬁnished third’

just four points behind Lehigh.
Penn State garnered 35 points’
while the Panthers had 27.

The injury,—ridden Blue and
Gold could do no better than a
distant ﬁfth. Dave Johnson pro-
vided the partisans with the only
joy as he became the ﬁrst wrest-
ler in Panther history to win the
Eastern title three years in a row.
'Johnson edged by Steve Freidman
of Cornell by a .2-1 count.

Alberts Eliminated

Three Perrymen, Paul Powell,
Bob Richardson, and Ted Bien-
.kowski, were out oflthe Tourna-
ment because assorted injuries
and sicknesses. Powell and Rich-
ardson caught a virus while Bien-
kowski was still recovering from
an injury received in the Lehigh
meet.

Tom Alberts recovered enough
to enter the tournament, but
was still heavily taped, thereby
cutting down his effectiveness.
Alberts was eventually elimi-
nated by‘ George Gray of ‘Penn
State in the quarter ﬁnals. _
.Dave Auble of Cornell had an

easy time in winning the 123
pound crown. Auble defeated Ed
Carlin of Syracuse in the ﬁnals by
a 6-2 score.

Gratto Wins

Two-time 130 pound winner,
Johnny Johnston of Penn State,
made it three. Johnston defeated
Carmin Molino of Cornell by a
4-2 count. To win Johnston had
to stave off a last second effort by
Molino for a “take down.”

Joe Gratto, NCAA 137 champ
Eastern champ two years ago,
won over Guy Guccione of Penn
State 5-3 while his teammate
Dick Santoro edgved by Dick Vin-
cent 3-2 in a disputed victory. A
faulty time clock had given Vin-
cent a point for “ridding time”
that he actually didn’t have.
After a protest by Lehigh Coach
Gerry Lehman the victory was
awarded to Santoro when the
_.clock was found defective.

The [167 pound class provided‘

the most excitement when Charles
Crosby of Rutgers edged Bill

Murphy of Syracuse 7-6 in a wilclj

scoring match that was decided

by a “take-down” in_,the last 1.1‘

seconds by Crosby.

Pete Davidson of Lehigh
squeezed by Bill White of Syra-
cuse-by a similar score of 7-6.
Dave Dunlop of Cornell outlasted
Tony Stremic in an overtime
heavyweight battle, 2-1.

Johnston of Penn State won the

Volleyball Tilt

The Panther Volleyball Club
coached by Assistant Physical
Education Instructor Herb Mc-
Gibbney is practicing daily with
the intention that Skyscraper U.
might have its ﬁrst entry in
recent years in the NCAA Volley-
ball Tournament. The tournament
will be held May 1, in Scranton.

Coach McGibbney, who has
tried unsuccessfully in recent
years to create interest in Volley-
ball has reached into the ranks of
some of the major sports this year
for material._

He has come up with some top
flight personnel which he thinks
can form the nucleus ofa for-
midable team. Panther gridders
Bill Kaliden and Fred Riddle
team up with Barry Brautigan
(Basketball) and _‘Jack Horox
(Soccer) to give the squad a vet-
eran line of spikers that prove
Volleyball is not just for girls.

McGibbney is also favored by_

the addition of many other players

‘ who have had valuable experi-

ence while playing on powerful
high school teams. Setters Tom
Hannon, John Sullivan, Barry Mc-
Cormick, John Burkett, Jack Go-
ga, Jack Rohrman, and Bob
Gwynn played on outstanding
teams -as did,spikers Rich Mor-
gart, D‘ennis Danko, and Jim Car-
azola. '
The squad, which will compete
in the AAU Tournament in April
and the NCAA in May, played

ious in straight sets 16-14, 16414.

Spring Practice Slated

— By LARRY HAGGERTY
_ Coach John Michelosen plansto start spring football
practice on Monday if the weather permits. Under NCAA
rules, the Panthers are allowed to hold practice sessions with-

in a period of 30 days,

The first week of practice will deal mainly with the basic l wil.l be concluded in the latter

fundamentals and the blending in of the ‘freshmen squad with

last season’s
, members. The daily workouts will
ﬁtake place at Ellsworth Center.
 Michelosen’s main job will be to
 plug the-gap left in the line which
5 was caused by the graduation of
 stars as Dickvscherer, Ron
.. Kissel, A Dan Wisniewski, Dick
: Carr, and All—Americans Charles

; Brueckman and Jim McCusker.

Crafton Starts At Center
_ The tackle position appears to
’' be the weakest spot along the line
‘ since neither McCusker nor Kissel
: will be back. However, the Blue
, and Gold have three experienced
‘ men returning at the tackle slot
in Ken Montinari, Ernie West-
wood, and Bill Lindner.
Brueckman’s loss at center
will not be as drastic as most ex-
perts thought it would be since
Dons Grafton proved that he
could handle the position when
Brueckman was out of the line-
up. Seraﬁno Fazio will be back
and will serve as Crafton’s main

> replacement.

The Jungle Cats lack depth at

V‘ the guard positions, but as long
'3 as John Guzik and Ed Michaels

‘ remain healthy, the Panthers will

‘ have two of the finest guards in '
‘_”the East.

The Blue and Gold have little‘

to worry about atthe end position.
Returning are such standouts as
Art Gob, Jim Zanos, and Jim
Pullekines. Gob has been tabbed
by many experts in pre-season
iorecasts as a good bet to gain
football honors.

care of by four veteran lettermen.
They are Dick Haley, Joe Scisly,
John Flara, and Andy Sepsi. How-
ever, Haley may have to take
things easy .for a while since an
ankle injury suﬂered last season
still bothers him.

“There are a lot of promising
freshmen up from last seasons
squad, and they should add depth
to the lineup,” commented Mich-
elosen.

In objecting to such a program
Pat Perri, Col. ’59, commented,
“Tap Day can not be combined

total desired impression of such a
serious event would be lost to the

sentative Pat Perri reported to
Congress the four probable bal-
loting sites for the Mar. 26 elec-
tion. These are the School of
Public Health Professions, Engi-
neering Hall, Commons Room
and possibly the Student Union.

SC was informed that
