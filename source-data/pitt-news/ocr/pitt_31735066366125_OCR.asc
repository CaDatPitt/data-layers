3 Legal Awareness Committee Hits

Registration Procedure

. "We’ve been trying to work to-

ﬂgether with the Board, but noth-

“Wing has been accomplished." said
Bob Ging, Legal Awareness Com-
mittee Co-chairman. at the July
13 Student Government Board
meeting.

“We never received rationale
on why our proposals in June
were put down. There's just no
communication."

Referring to proposals for a Le-
gal Awareness—sponsored concert
in Pitt Stadium and a bail bond
fund, Ging accused the Board of
being "negligent” of their duties.
concerning the Legal Awareness
Committee.

Ging was also disappointed that

the Legal Awareness budget had

1,.‘ been put off from April until July,

""' and that personal travel expenses

were not paid during the second
semester.

Board member Terri Weaver
said, "We (the Board) were new
I here and did not know too much
about your case . . . Why didn’t
you take any action to go to the
Allocations Committee?"
.3, "The point is," said Ging. "that
'” when we asked t'or money. we
justified everything. including
persons. dates, amounts of money.
but ,did not receive any satisfac-
tion. . . Everyone of our memos
to Board members have received
no replies."

“I don’t want to waste my time
dictating letters if I can talk to
you personally. Maybe our times

5». . have conflicted, but you have
i never been there at your office
any time I've been,” said Weav-

er.

‘‘I‘m sorry." she continued.
"we're not super human beings.
but I have committees who have
been waiting longer than you . . .

We’re as short-staffed as you
are."

Weaver also added that com-
munication between the two or-
ganizations was "needed," but

that it was not always possible.

WEAVER: Not Superhuman

Jeff Pasek, Legal Awareness
Committee Chairman, said, “If
you want your committees to work.
you have to set policies for them.“

With a will to “patch up" the
differences between the two or-
ganizations. Bailey added. “I
think we should just forget the
past."

Earlier in the meeting. proposals
by Ging and Pasek to add funds
to their budget had failed.

A request for a police radio
costing $124 was refused by the
Allocations Committee on grounds

that “the radio as explained at the _

interview would be ineffective
and that the cost would not be
justified."

“The benefit the radio would
be to students,” said Ging, “would

This coalition attempted to in-

Although the model bill was
not adopted as a plank in the

Registration of valuables with the Campus Police will aid in
identifying them if they are stolen. Superintendant of University Pol-
ice Joseph Gil and Inspector,Chuck' Bervard recently explained the

registration process and discussed how students can help prevent‘

theft on campus. _

According to Gil, “Registration cards will be given to dorm stu-
dents in the fall when they check into their rooms. Each student
who participates can list his valuables and corresponding serial num-
bers on the card. ‘

“It will then be the. student’s responsibility to return the card
to either the Housing Office or us.” The method of returning the
cards hasn't been decided upon yet.

Gil continued, “The concept of registering valuables was creat-
ed through an excellent idea of one of our policemen. He asked the
Department's permission to inscribe an identification number, with
an electric pencil, on the frames of bicycles belonging to students
who were willing to participate.

“A card is put on file here at Varsity Hall with the registra-
tion number and name of the owner. If the ownership of the bike
is transferred, all the student has to do is notify us and we’ll change
the name on the card.

“I see no reason why the concept of bike registration can’t be‘

extended to include registration of other valuables.”

Bervard explained the value of registration. “Fifty bicycles have
been stolen since the beginning of the year, and ten or twelve of
these were registered with us.

"Four of those with identification numbers were recovered. so
almost 50% of the registered bikes were found.

"The lock and .chain are no longer an absolute guarantee in’

keeping bikes safely secured because we have apprehended young-
sters who could cut chains.

_ “A ‘quick axle release’ has been put on the market. It enables
the rider to easily remove the bike’s front wheel. He then can take
the wheel wherever he’s going. A bike with a missing wheel isn’t
as appealing to a thief as one with both wheels.”

Gil recommended an alarm system that sounds if the bike or
alarm itself are tampered with.

. Bervard gave a word of caution. “If you see someone acting sus-
piciously by the bike racks. call us and we'll check it out. Also, if
someone is stealing something of yours, don’t confront him. Call
us.

Bervard and Gil stressed that by registering valuables with their
serial numbers or other; identifying marks, any,stolen items can-be
more easily identified if found.

Gil said that bicycles can be brought to Varsity Hall any time to
be inscribed. Registration cards are on order by the Campus Police
Department. Faculty and staff can obtain cards by calling the de-
partment.

aimed at increasing awareness of
police procedures. The second
part of the five part program will
be held tomorrow at 10 a.m. in

After Monday evening’s ses-
sion of the Democratic National
Convention, the tension faded
quite a bit. The convention, how-
ever, was more than the nomina-
tion of a candidate for the Amer-
ican presidency. A unique dele-

~ gation, representing for the first

time in America’s history the
massive voting power of women.
Chicanos,_ blacks and young peo-
ple, felt the electricity of the

‘moment and passed it on to the

rest of us, so that we could gobble
it up vicariously.

Monday night was the night of
Credentials fights, the most im-
portant ones being the well-pub-
licized South Carolina, Californ-
ia anu Illinois battles:

Earlier that day, I talked to
Rev. Ralph Abernathy of the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference.' He ‘spoke of his’ hun-

gry and poor followers camping
out in Resurrection City II. Later.
of course, the word spread that
Rev. Abernathy himself "camped
out” in a hotel.

Governor Wallace addressed
the convention on Tuesday to
press for the adoption of the “Wal-
lace forces” minority reports,
on the subjects of welfare, taxes,
busing, and law and order. His
representatives presented all
these planks as a package, a sure
sign that even Wallace had no
hope of getting any of these
passed. \

As a matter of fact. Wallace
himself was in anything but top
form. Even though we all know
he had been seriously hurt. I

.would guess that almost every-

one still expected him to be his
old vibrant, fighting self.

But his voice was weak. and
his speech monopolized the top-
ics of "the average citizen“ and

‘ least a dozen places .

Convention Breaks Tradition

"remember how popular I was."
One might think he was merely
downcast because he stood so
little chance of winning the
nomination. However. the other
candidates did not react similarly.

Rhetorically. the speech was
given f'rom the point of view of
futility. He seemed to constantly
barrage us with reminders of his
past successes in each primary.
If I didn’t know better. I'd say
he sounded like a man with little
public speaking experience.

George Wallace could have
used that particular speech in at
. . but the
Democratic National Convention
shouldn’t have been one of them.

Needless to say, all the Wal-
lace planks died on the conven-
tion floor. But the Wallace move-
ment hasn't perished. He and
his followers, as he said ‘in his
address, “want this party to be-
come again the party of the aver-

Last Tuesday night's Alice
Cooper concert at Three Rivers
Stadium proved to be less than
satisfying in many ways.

First. the British band "Uriah
Heep" failed to show. The
“Groundhogs" and John Kay fol-
lowed suit. An acoustic guitar
duo named "Two Steel“ opened
the show, but the less said about
them the better. -

After a wait of about an hour.
"Humble Pie“ finally mounted
the stage.

What a change from last year!
No longer do they employ the
guitar wizardry of Peter Framp-
ton. Ergo, the rise and fall of the

i band seems to rest almost solely

on the wiry shoulders of singer
and guitarist, Steve Marriott.

Marriott is probably one of
the finest belters in rock". He is
equipped with the tone and range
of Stevie Wonwood coupled with
the snarls of a Mick Jagger.

Their act consisted mainly of
recent material such as "C’mon
Everybody” from their album
Smokin. After two warm-up num-

bers, the group blasted into a.

frenzied version of “Honky-Tonk
Woman” as a tribute to the R011-

ado."

ing Stones. They acquitted them-
selves very nicely. but after the
third chorus it became tedius.

Finally, after a wait that seem-
ed like days, while overzealous
fans were evacuated from the
infield, “Alice Cooper” motored
their way onto the field in a
Rolls Royce convertible. Fantastic!
If the “Stones” can have their
own’ Lear jet to deposit them-
selves anywhere in America’s
hinterlands, then “Alice” de-
serves at least a chauffeur-driven
Rolls!

I believe. that it is finally time
to reckon with this band. With
each album_they eclipse the for-
mer. Forgetting for a moment
their music. they are true
genisues when it comes to the-
atrics. their stage acts. from the
electrecution of “Dwight Fry."
to the hanging of the "Desper-
to the "West Side Story"
parody are extraordinary!

The band opened their set with
"Public Animal Number 9" to
set the tone of the concert. While
Jagger says he was schooled with
a “strap right across my back,“
Alice’s education seems a bit
more familiar: “cheating on math
tests and carving dirty words‘ in
our desks.”

  ‘Lewd’ Cooper Snakes Way Into Fa

A medley of “Caught in a
Dream,” “Under My Wheels”
and “Be My Lover” followed.
Then came the‘ “Alice Cooper”
anthem—“Eighteen” with full
organ accompaniement! The
song was sheer heaven! I’ve seen
Alice perform this several times
before, but this was the most

‘depraved, lewd version that ~I’ve

ever witnessed.

The band. outfitted in red. green
and yellow costumes. danced and
played their instruments as if
they've never known sanity in
their lives! Debached court
jesters performing in the service
of their mad tyrant. The king is
dead! Long live the queen!

Cooper then performed his
usual embraces with his pet boa
set to the music of "Is It My
Body?" as he has done countless
times before. .

The newest addition to the act
was the "West Side Story" street
fight during "Gutter Cat versus
the Jets” from the School’s Out
al. ..11. Alice was the “Riff” of
1972 complete with switchblade
and drag. This led ,direct1y‘into
"Killer” from the album of the
same name.

It climaxed with the infamous

For the first time since the Road Racing Teams
schedule started on May 21. with the Steel Cities National
Sports Car Race. the Pitt-Gulf Javelin. better known as
the only collegiate sports Car racing team. had everything
go near perfect on the track. As a result. the Javelin pulled
off an impressive win.

In the Bridgehampton. New York. National Sports Car
Race the Javelin came within a half second of smashing
Mark ~Donahue’s track record on route to the second
National Sports Car Race victory in three tries.

The newly acquired Javelin turned the course in 1:49 by
opening up a three second a lap lead and eventually won
the race by 75 seconds. In the past. the Javelin has had
extremely good days on Saturdays—the trials—and
extremely bad luck on race days. Sundays. In what might
have been a stroke of luck and a preview of things to come.
the Javelin failed to win the pole position. Instead, the car
qualified second. But on Sunday. the car had no trouble at
all first following the leader and then surpassing him.

The leader, ironically again, was Lenny Greenhalge,
who had qualified second to the Javelin’s Bob Fryer at the
_Lime Rock, Connecticut, National Sports Car Race the
‘preceding Sunday. But on that day the Javelin had trouble
starting and staying in ‘fourth gear and fell to Greenhalge

' and his Viper Racing Company Camaro.

But on this day. cooling problems. steering and shifting
problems. and breaking problems. all of which had
hampered the car didn’t make the trip.

"I wasn't familiar with the track.” Fryer said after the
race." I let the leader (Greenhalges Camaroi set the pace

and after I familiarized myself with the track I passed,

him.
“The car was stronger in this race than in any other

 

race so far this year.”

The Javelin that Fryer now races was Mark Donohue‘s
backup car last year. Donohue. using an identical Javelin.
went on to become last year’s National Sports Car Racing
champion at Atlanta. Georgia. last November. before
attaining the Indianapolis 500 win this year.

Perhaps because the Javelin was his old car. Donohue
decided to look and testthe Pitt Javelin on a skid pad in the
middle of June, in Philadelphia. On par with the way
things had been going for Fryer and his crew. Donohue
was hurt in a smashup and rain prohibited anyone else
'_from testing that car in the city of brotherly love.

The win at New York gave Fryer’s crew nine more
points in their search for enough tallies to travel to Atlanta
this November for the national championship. Fryer made
the trip last year and is anxious to do so again.

The Javelin is ranking second at this time in the North-
Eastern United States division with its total of 24 points.
The other points were made possible by the Javelin‘s
performances at Nelson Leges Ohio (9). Lime Rock last
week (6). and the Bridgehampton win on Sunday (9).

Just because everything went well last Sunday. Fryer
will not let the next two weeks before the second Steel
Cities National Sports Car Race idle away. Fryer plans to
have a new breaking system installed before that race.
The Pitt Crew is also working on a new gearshift leaver
and advanced development work on the intake manifold
and exhaust systems.

"I don’t like to make predictions." Fryer said. But.
Lenny Greenhalge will be there and anything can happen.

opponent)—defeated Psychology 5-0 to move into the
second round. .

Scapels‘ 5-2 to move up in their sub-division.
