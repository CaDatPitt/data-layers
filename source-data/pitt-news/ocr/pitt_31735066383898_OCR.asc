Dr. Sharon Johnson and the University last month entered
an unpublicized written agreement that exchanged
Johnson’s promise not to appeal her court-approved denial of
tenure for Pitt’s pledge not to sue her for legal fees and court
costs associated with the ﬁve-year legal battle.
The agreement, a copy of which has been obtained by the
Pltt News, was offered by Vice Chancellor for the Health

Professions Nathan Stark Aug. 4 and accepted by J oliiison six _

days later. It allowed Johnson to continue her research at Pitt

“until June 30, 1978,“despite the fact an Aug. 1 decision by

U.S. District. Court Judge William Knox dissolved an
injunction that forced Pitt to employ Johnson during the trial.
’ Johnson ﬁled suit against Pitt in 1973 while employed as an
assistant professor in the School of Medicine, alleging sex
discrimination was involved in her October, 1971 denial of
tenure. Knox found for Pitt on all counts.

The Pitt News also has obtained an Aug. 6 letter in which
Sylvia Roberts, Johnson’s lawyer, detailed for Pitt’s lawyers
“my understanding of your responses to my questions

Sharon Johinson,aPitt Enter Unpublicized Pact

Roberts listed eight points concerning the agreement as
she understood it. They included:

-an understanding that Johnson’s working conditions at
Pitt would not be altered;

—a clause that enjoins each side from publicly commenting
on the case after a mutually accepted statement has been
released; and ’

—an agreement that Johnson will not.be considered for a
tenured position. ‘

Spokesmen for the University would not comment on the
correctness of Robert's assumptions or on any other matter

- related to Johnson.

“It is the University’s position that no further comment is
to be made,” a spokesman said last night.

However, a secretary in Pitt’s legal services office said, ‘ ‘A
settlement certainly was made.”

Roberts, contacted at her Baton Rouge, La., home last
night, said only, “I have nothing to say.”

Johnson, whose new position is seniorresearch associate,
also declined comment. , .

A source close to the Johnson case quoted the 43-year-old
biochemist as saying, “I’m afraid that if I say a word, they’ll
throw me out.”

The Pitt News has learned that Johnson was told by Pitt’s
attorneys, through Roberts, to refrain from all comment on
the case.

The letter from Stark, however, detailed most substantive

portions of the settlement. Stark told Johnson that, with the
concurrence of her department’s acting chairman Robert
Basford, and School of Medicine Dean Gerhard Werner, ‘ ‘the
University of Pittsburgh is willing to assist you in retaining
your grant and to give you an appointment ‘as a ‘senior
research associate...from Aug. 2, 1977, through June 30,
l978...or until such earlier date as you may transfer your
(National Institute of Health) grant to another institution.”

J ohnson, who has applied to several hundred schools, has
been unable to secure other employment.

Stark also wrote, “As we understand and interpret Judge
Knox’ s ruling, you ceased to be an employee of the University
of Pittsburgh on Aug. 1, 1977.”

That statement was voided when Johnson signed a copy of
Stark’s letter and returned it to his ofﬁce. Her current term of
employment “will not be renewed” after June 30, 1978,
according to Stark’s letter.

Stark’s letter also claimed Johnson’ s acceptance of the pact
would excuse her from liability for “very substantial” legal
fees incurred by the'University in its defense. The University
previously announced that $300,000 had been spent in the
defense; National Organization for Women members claimed
the figure was nearer $1.5.mi_llion. _

Stark’s proposal, which carried an Aug. 10 deadlmg, was
signed by Johnson and delivered to Stark’s ofﬁced on the
afternoon of Aug. 10.

The texts of the two letters appear on page two.

text of a letter from Sylvia Roberts, Johnson’s
lawyer, to Leonard Scheinholt, lawyer for the
University. The Pitt News did not obtain either
letter from Sharon’ Johnson, the University, or

these letters appears on page one.

Dear Dr. J ohnson:

On March 8, 1972, you were notified that your employment
as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biochemistry in
the School of Medicine would end on June 30, 1973, at the
expiration of your second three-year appointment. On May 31,
1973, Judge William Knox issued a preliminary injunction
holding up the termination of your employment until he could
rule on the merits of your lawsuit.

This occurred on August 1, 1977 when Judge Knox issued his
Adjudication, Findings of Fact, Opinion, and Conclusions of
Law. The Judgment Order filed on the same date dismissed your
complaint, entered final judgment in favor of all defendants,
and dissolved the preliminary injunction issued on May 31,

I973.

Therefore, as we understand and interpret Judge Knox’s
ruling, you ceased to be an employee of the University of
Pittsburgh on August 1, 1977. Nevertheless, if you do not intend
to file an appeal from Judge Knox’s decision, with the
concurrence of the Acting Chairman of your Department and
the Dean of the Medical School, the University of Pittsburgh is
willing to assist you in retaining your grant and to give you
sufficient time to seek employment elsewhere by offering you an
appointment as a Senior Research Associate at your present
salary from August 2, 1977 through June 30, 1978 when the
current year’s funding on your grant expires or until such earlier
date as you may transfer your grant to another institution. This
appointment will not be renewed after that date. In addition,
since you will be waiving your right of appeal if you accept this
offer of employment, the University and all other defendants
will be willing to waive their right to seek court costs and
attorneys fees, which we understand will be very substantial.

If, on the other hand, you decide to appeal, under those
circumstances it would be inappropriate for us to continue your -
employment at the University of Pittsburgh beyond August 1,
197 7.

If you are willing to accept the terms and conditions of this
offer, would you so indicate at the place provided below and
§e)tulr37t_lte attached copy of this letter to me no later than August

Very truly yours,

Re: Dr. Sharon Johnson v. University of Pittsburgh, et al

Dear Mr. Scheinholtz:

On August 4, 5 and 6, 1977, you and I have had discussions
regarding clarification of certain matters contained in the letter
from Vice Chancellor Stark to Dr. Sharon Johnson, dated
August 4, 1977. I should like to confirm my understanding of
your responses to my questions relative to Dr. Stark’s letter as
follows:

I) The concurrence of the acting chairman and the Dean of
the School -of Medicine has already been secured, and therefore
there is no further action on the part of University personnel that
need be taken in order for this agreement to be perfected once
Dr. Johnson signs a copy of Vice Chancellor Stark’s letter.

2) Dr. J ohnson’s working conditions will be the same as they
were prior to August 1, 1977, with respect to the location of her
laboratory, the amount of space she can use, and her access to
departmental equipment.

3) In the event Dr. Johnson is able to find a place to move her
grant, she will be permitted to take with her the equipment
which has been purchased under the grant in conformity with
regulations of the National Institutes of Health.

4) If it should prove necessary for Dr. Johnson to secure
permission from the National Institutes of Health to reallocate
sums of money attributed to various line items in her grant, for
example, to reallocate sums of money originally designated
payment of a technician’s salary to expenses of moving,
University personnel would perform the administrative duties to
assist her in this effort if her request conforms to the regulations
of the National Institutes of Health.

5) No further documents will be signed in order to
memorialize the agreement on the part of Dr. Johnson to waive
her right of appeal and the University of Pittsburgh to waive its
request to the court for attorney fees and costs.

6) Dr. Johnson knows and understands that she will not be
considered for tenure or a tenure stream position, or any other
position at the University of Pittsburgh at the expiration of the
appointment set forth in Vice Chancellor Stark’s letter of
August 4, 1977.

7) With regard to a public announcement of the resolution of
Dr. J ohnson’s status, a statement will be prepared by the
University’s public relations department which will describe the
substantive terms of the settlement as contained in Dr. Stark’s
letter of August 4, 1977. Mr. Hannon of the Legal Services
Department will be in touch with me to read to me the statement
next week after he communicates with you. No other statements
regarding this agreement will be made by either Dr. Johnson or
the University.

8) Dr. Johnson may signify her agreement to the terms of Dr.
Stark’s letter by bringing a copy of the same signed by her to Dr.
Stark’s office on or before 5:00 o’clock p.m., August 10, 1977.

Yours sincerely,

Alden Earl Bowen from the Office of
Student Affairs. There will, how-
ever, be an “in-house” directory,
which will be used by several
administrative ofﬁces, including
the Office of Student Affairs. The
“in-house” directory is used to
locate students, inform the news
media of student accomplishments
and respond to legitimate external
requests for information regarding
students.

In order to produce this
directgory, the University must,
according to the “Privacy Rights of
Parents and Students,” (more
commonly referred to as the
“Buckley Amendment), afford
students the opportunity to remove
their names and personally identiﬁ-
able information from the directory.

Board Bounces Stephen  
From Committee Chair

‘ ness Committee.

/(_‘()r1II/iued from Past’ /I

Payne was quick to point out that
Stephen ’s removal as LAC Com-
mittee chairman was not a
comment on his competency.

“I have nothing to show he was
incompetent, but I can’t stress
enough how important it is for a
chairman to be available,” Payne
said. “The chairman must make
himself available to students as
well as to the board. The board had
become impatient trying to contact
Bruce and work out a schedule.

A member of the Legal Aware
who asked to
remain anonymous. concurred with
Payne's assessment of Stephen .

“At times he was unavailable,”
the committee member said. “He
was in SGS (School of General
Studies) and we immediately
associated him with not being here.

I fwe (the committee couldn’t get
to him, we didn’t keep trying hard
enough. He is definitely a
competent chairman. It was his
inaccessibility that was the main
problem. Other than that he was
great.”

. In a phone interview Stephen
said, “The board has the right to
remove a chairman; it is within their
wer to do so. I was not afforded
the opportunity to defend myself. I
don’t believe it was responsible of
the board to take such an action
without affording me the oppor-
tunity to defend myself.

As far as I am concerned, I am

would not say whether the board
would accept Stephenjfor a second
time. should the committee submit
his name for approval.

The committee's new policy is an
blending of established programs
with new practical additions. The‘
result. Payne hopes will “strength-
en and rebuild" the committee.

Legal workshops and seminars
now will be offered. along with
traditiional Legal Awareness Com-
mittee services such as defending
students before the University

“The committee has suffered
from a lack of student participation

over the last two or three years,”'

Payne said. “We want to broaden
the scope of legal services offered
to students."

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Pitt and Publicity

Coming on the heels of a recent barrage of bad Pitt publicity,
the recently released report concerning Pitt’s impact on the local
economy, must have made administrators and other University
supporters especially happy. And with good reason: The report
was another ‘bit of evidence supportingywhat everyone should
have known for some time--Pitt is as beneficial as it is irreplacable
inthe economic scheme of this region.

Often maligned but always asked for assistance, the University
is in the midst of a public relations man's nightmare. It is being
blamed, in error, for a tax increase that seems to be inevitable in
Pennsylvania; it is being dragged into a fraternity-"neighbor fight
in which it can do it little; it is being blasted, often in error, by
vocal neighbors who are sometimes ludicrous in their blind
opposition of Pitt expansion, and it is finishing two academic
arguments that tainted all involved parties.

Given all of this, we can understand Pitt’s eagerness to make
known the results of the economic analysis, which documents
financial advantages Pitt offers graduates, Oakland, the city and
the region. And we share it.

Pitt is far from perfect, even on the football field, but like its
Panthers, the University is far better than average in many
respects. It’s time that Pitt’s detractors remember the
University's advantages, which outweigh the disadvantages, even
in time of acute bad feeling toward it.

Students and Housing

Pitt’s recent move to purchase a former Forbes Avenue nursing
home and turn it into a dormitory is one we welcome. Even
though it knows students will become fewer in coming years, Pitt
invested (though it got the money from the government) in an
area that will benefit many students for many years.

The current housing situation around campus is unfortunate for
everyone save Oakland’s landlords. Dormitory space is
insufficient, even for undergraduates. Whether by choice or
housing office rejection, many undergraduates are forced to
join all graduate students in a yearly race for any and every room
in Oakland, Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, East Liberty and,
occasionally, elsewhere.

So many landlords, realizing the students’ compromised position,
charge highersthan-fair rents and offer less-than-fair service.
Pitt’s housing office, meanwhile, is not forced to compete for
rent payments, either, since the waiting list is longer than any
vacancy list each year. .

The result ‘is’ that no provider of campus or near-campus
housing is forced by competiton to offer a good deal, and rarely
does a student find one.

The additions of Bruce Hall and the Forbes Pavillion to Pitt’s
dormitories may ease the situation in the short run, and make
long-term prospects, especially for graduate students, a joy to
anticipate. Landlords may be forced to bargain for student
dollars, and it is not inconceivable that dorm living could become
better. In fact, living in Oakland may become bearable again.

population. This committee was
also to provide opportunities for
those students who desired to know
the “ins” and “outs” of the concert
business; and give them practical
experience that would be difficult to
get elsewhere; but most import-
antly, as all Student Government
committees‘, it was to serve the
student body.

Traditionally, this committee has
been given an annual budget of
approximately 80,000 dollars to
bfing concerts to Pitt. In recent
years, the meteoric growth of the
concert industry and market in
Pittsburgh has been phenomenal.
In just the last few years, this area
has come from being a good market

. to one of the best in America. Too,

the Concert Committee has become
an ever decreasing number of

, people. Unfortunately, the variety

of the types of concerts decreased
also. More and more the concerts
came to show the preferences of a

small group of individuals and not
the entire student body here at Pitt.

Never had students had a direct
voice in the types of concerts they
would most like to have on our
campus.

After hours of deliveration and
investigation, the Board and I
decided that ‘students do not have
the time, knowledge or resources to
compete with the promoters of the _
Pgh, area in providing major
concerts. We are painfullysawareef

that this loss was a much smag

have lost in futile attempts at giving
large concerts.

As for the Programming Commit-
tee, I do not believe it would be wise
or beneﬁcial to anyone to rush into
forming a committee at this time.
Whatever future courses the
committee will take, or if there is a
need for such a committee at all, at
this point is something to be
considered at -.'a much later date.

So, on behalf of the Board, I

would like to thank the students and ‘

the Pitt News for their popular
support of this project. The Board
and I believe our decision was a..,wise

and workable one. Obviousi‘5.,/you?

By R. DAVID TIVE

The school year is one week old
and the ﬁscal year is over two
months old, but Pitt is still waiting
for its allocation from the state. And
contrary to most statements being
made, it doesn't look like the money
will be coming through soon.

That Pitt, the other three
state-related universities and some
private colleges and medical
schools will receive their money is
not in serious doubt. The primary
questions are when the decisions
will be made and how much the
allocations will be. The situation at
the time the state budget was
approved looked bleak. The outlook
today has not changed, as was

pointed out, perhaps unintention-
ally, by the columns on the Pitt
NewsOp/ Ed page last week.

If it was merely a question of how
much money to give the schools, the
situation would not be so serious,
only annoying. But as it stands
now, the colleges are trapped in a
quagmire of unenlightened self-in-
terest, legislative irresponsibility
and political demagoguery. A brief
analysis of the issues and the
legislators’ responses to them prove
the point.

New taxes is the one issue
inseparable from aid to the schools.
The budget passed last month to
operate the state government was
balanced only because the money
originally earmarked for the
colleges was used to balance the

operational budget and avoitgie
taxes. Even so, the budget’ - 

compromise; Over $200 million
more had tobe cut. That and the
$300 million for the colleges erased
the need for $500 million in new
taxes Governor Shapp had asked for
when he proposed his budget last
January. As of this moment, all
anticipated state revenue will go
toward the operation of the state
government. Any money for the
colleges and universities must come
from new taxes.

So where does that leave the
schools? On the surface, it seems to
be an easy matter to raise the 6’  .
$300 million, less that 4 percent of
the total state budget, and give it to
Pitt and the others. But that point

l(.‘onIinuer/ (III Page 5)



(Continuedfrom P03? 4)
won’t be reached until the
legislators admit what the issues
are and ﬁnally get around to dealing
with them. There are three
problems that prevent the anti-tax
legislators from considering the
issues in proper perspective. 0

Next year is an election year. The
entire House and half of the Senate
will be up for re-election. Many of
those opposed to new taxes are
opposed because they want to run
next year and be able to say they
resisted the drive to raise taxes.

‘(,3 This is where the unenlightened

self-interestcomes in. Many of
these legislators are not rejecting
new taxes on the merits of the idea,
but on the grounds that they
personally will suffer. They
evidently would prefer it if the state
as a whole suffered instead. It is
interesting to note that their opinion
of their constituents has led these
legislators to believe they can
convince us they are acting in our
best interests by,merely acting in
what they perceive to be their own
best interests. The result is they are
refusing to deal with the issues of
this problem.

As bad as these legislators are,

grgthere is another group that is even

“worse. These are the ones who are
against new taxes because they feel
the state is spending too much
money already. We must cut, cut,
cut, they say, and it’s not really that
important what we cut as long as we
cut. Even if a program is working
and is beneﬁcial, we've got to cut.
These legislators obviously don’t
want to strain themselves by having
to evaluate the various programs of
state government and determine if
they should be cut or kept. The
meat ax approach is so much more

fun. They are being completely
irresponsible -and are refusing to
deal with the issues of this problem.

As bad as they are, the worst is
yet to come. We have yet to hear
from the demagogues. There are
fewer of them, but they are worse
since they are positions of power.
These men have hidden agendas
behind their opposition to new
taxes. Tom Nolan, former Senate
Majority Leader, is fanatical in his
hatred of Milton Shapp. He would
do anything to hurt Shapp and this
hassent him into a high pitch of
anti-tax fervor. House Republican
ﬂoor leader Bob Butera’s motives
are much more common. He wants
to be governor. Apparently, he
wants to be governor even if he has
to ruin the state getting there.
Neither Butera, Nolan, nor others of
their ilk are willing to deal with the
issues of this problem.

Throw together all these factors
——unenlightened self-interest, leg-
islative irresponsibility and political
demagoguery—and you get some
idea as to why it took the legislature
seven months to approve a budget
and then come up with such a putrid
compromise. It was hoped that
after the horror of those ﬁnal days
before the budget was passed, with
welfare recipients and the state
employees camped out with porta-
johns in the Capitol Building, that
some legislators would start giving
some serious thought to what they
were doing. No such luck.

'. If the column written by Butera in
last Wednesday’s Pitt News is any
indication, nothing has changed.

When the legislature comes back
later this month, the anti-tax forces
will continue to fight the battle they
lost last month. They will still
refuse to deal with the real issues of

how much money the colleges and
universities should get and where
this money should come from in the
way of new taxes.

Not once in his article did Butera
say he favored funding Pitt and the
others. In all fairness, he did not
say he didn't favor it. However, he
referred seven times to “political
coercion” and “intimidation” in-
volved in getting the initial budget
passed and three times he made
derogatory comments about politi-

refusing to realize what will happen
if the schools aren't funded and
funded soon. They are refusing to
. admit that a tax hike is necessary to
provide that funding. They are
refusing to look at the ﬁgures for aid
to higher education in Pennsylvania
compared to other states.
Pennsylvania ranks anywhere from
40th to 48th, depending on the
criteria used, behind such bastions
of educational excellence as Ala-
V bama, Mississippi and Georgia.
Most of all, they are refusing to do
the job they were elected to do and
have an obligation to do. Until that
all happens, we still can’t even take
the first step toward getting any
money. r
The road will be a long one. Even

after the legislators decide they are
willing to talk about the issue of
funding the colleges, it will take a
two-thirds majority of both Houses
to pass the bills. Only then will

debate begin on how to raise the ‘

extra $300 million. There will be
much debate on wliaf tax is best.

That in itself will be a long, drawn
out affair. It is signiﬁcant .to
remember that in 1969-1970, all the
appropriation bills were passed
early in the year. However, it
wasn’t until March, nine months
after the start of the ﬁscal year, that
the legislature ﬁnally approved tax
revenues to fund all of them. The
question of what taxes to impose or

raise is one that deserves to be dealt '

with in a separate column.

the building.

The University will need approval
of the City’s Zoning Commission,
Planning Commission and the full
City Council before it can proceed to
renovate Forbes Pavi1.ion.

The building is under a special
zoning regulation, which allows it to
be used only as a nursing home
facility. Hearings on a zoning
change must be held by the Zoning
Commission and will allow for
University and community input.

Opposition to University pur-
chase of the Forbes Pavilﬂion
purchase is expected to be minimal
on the part of City Council. But if

' past experience holds true, Oakland

resident groups can be expected to
register disapproval.

Last year, community opposition
snagged a University plan to build
20 four-person townhouses on the
corner of Bates and Oakland Streets
in Oakland.

The citizens’ groups said at the
time that their main objection to

townhouse construction was the
reduction of parking facilities.

Bernie Payne, president of the
Student Government Board, voiced
hopes that Oakland residents will
not ﬁght the dormitory acquisition.

‘‘I believe that the people who
live in the community will
understnad the dire necessity for
the dorm. The building is already
there,” he said.

“It will bring more people into
the area and more money for the
merchants, ” Payne said.

Pitt has had a four percent
increase in its freshman population
and total Pitt population also has
increased. In the event the student
population decreases, administra-
tors foresee no real problem in
utilizing the extra dorm space.

with unﬁlled beds,” Vice Chancel.

Freshman Fall Weekend, sched-
uled for this weekend, was
cancelled yesterday to avoid a
ﬁnancial loss, according to Margy
Stein, chairman of the Student
Government Board’s Freshman Fall
Weekend Committee.

“Basically, there was a lack of
freshman support for the camp this
year,” Stein said. “We had no
more than 50 reservations from
freshmen. There was an over-
whelming amount of interest on the
part of upperclassmen and faculty
who serve as counselors, but
freshmen showed little interest.

“We’ve always had problems
getting freshmen to come,” Stein
said. “They are saturated with
events this weekend-—a football
game, Greek rush, lantern night
and other fall events.

The Freshman Fall Weekend was
a 40-year Pitt tradition and it's hard
to break,” Stein continued. “But
rather than lose money and present
a_poor quality event, we decided to

Bud Heaps, director of student
activities and the committee’s
advisor, said he didn’t believe lack
of publicity was the problem.

“There would have been a
ﬁnancial loss if the program went
through. The schedule of events
and this weekend’s time table were
the problems. Freshmen Fall
Weekend just took a low priority in
many freshman minds. No one is to
blame for the cancellation. The
committee did a fine job,” Heaps
said.

The committee is interested in
creating a new program to replace
the freshman camp.

“We’re going to continue the
standing committee and we will try
to institute a new program in its
place,” Stein said. “We may try to
coordinate the new program with
the orientation for new students
held in June.”

“The program helped freshmen
adjust to Pitt in the past,” Stein
added. ‘‘It was a good time for all
involved. There will be a lot of

All students with reservations for

First Kent State Ruling

3 Governor and Others Face New
Trial on Damage Claims

CINCINNATI, (AP)—The United

States Court of Appeals for the Sixth ‘

Circuit reversed a lower court ruling
today that had cleared Gov. James
A. Rhodes, state ofﬁcials and
National Guardsmen of damages
stemming from the May 4, 1970,
shootings at Kent State University
in which four students were killed.

The appellate court declared that
a new trial must be held because at
least one jury member had been
“threatened and assaulted during
the trial by a person interested in its
outcome.”

The appeals court also lifted its
ban on construction at Kent State of
a gymnasium near the scene of the
shootings. The contractor for the $6
million profect said that work could
resume by the end of the week. But
a spokesman for the May 4th
Coalition, which has protested the
construction for the last 137 days,

in from other universities to help
oppose the construction.

In calling for a new trial on the
damage suit, the appellate court
said that the trial judge, Don J.
Young, had been told near the end
of the trial that one juror had been
threatened three times and assault-
ed once. It said that the judge had
not interrogated the juror to learn
what effect the incident had had.on
him. The court called the incident
“an attempt to pervert our system

of justice at its very heart.”

Governor Told Not to Talk

I "in Chan Cochran, the Governor’s

administrative aide in Columbus,
said that Mr. Rhodes would have no
immediate comment» because his
attorneys had told him not to
discuss the case as long as litigation
was pending.

The $46 million damage suit
developed after Mr. Rhodes sent

Kent State campus in May 1970 to

An Abandoned Summer

By PAMELA EUSI
Pitt News Staff Writer

Summer jobs are scarce. So when
I knew I had a good thing going, I
didn’t want to blow it. April rolled
around, exams came and went and I
was ready to go out and make those
precious bucks for next fall.

Scoff if you will, but last summer,
and for three seasons before that, I
worked at Hershey Park. Yes, the
former “Playground of Pennsyl-
vania,” now turned into one of the
major theme parks in the East, was
my home away from home for those
golden summer months.

About 1,300 people are em-
ployed by Hershey Park for its
summer season, which stretched

__full-time this year from Memorial

Day to Labor Day and included
weekends in May, September and
October.

On a Saturday in early May,
orientation is held. This day
included assorted pep talks about
the upcoming season (reminding
me of a sports team), assignment to
your category (rides, food, mer-
chandising, security, etc.) and tours
of the park and your future work
area.

Also included in pre-season
errands are jaunts to the shoe store

Legal Awareness, a committee of
. Student Government Board, is
c iprised of students who offer
free services to University faculty,
staff and students.

These services include lending
legal advice, representing students
on the campus judicial board,
sponsoring special programs dur-
ing the year and assisting people
when they are arrested.

“We cannot act as lawyers,”
Stephen. said, “but we have a firm
of lawyers on retainer and we
consult them on cases we can’t
handle.”

hould a person have a legal
problem that requires consultation,
he can call or visit the LAC offices.
A committee member will listen to
his story and solicit legal advice on
the best course of action.

“We have about 10 calls or cases
a day,” Stephen said. He added,
however, that many are repeated
calls about one case.

pay the $12.50 in court costs.

“If we get enough cases, we
hope to stop landlords who
continually withhold security de-
posits,” Stephen said.

Under Operation ID, students
register their valuables with serial
numbers, used to ensure the return
of a recovered stolen object to its
owner.

There are approximately 20 LAC
members, a membership Stephen
claimed is “not enough.” -

“We are looking for students
interested in seeing the law in
action,” Stephen said. He added
that although many members wish
to pursue a law career, some are
only interested in seeing how the
law works.

LAC was formed in 1970, when
students saw a need for paralegal
services on campus. “There were
many cases involving marijuana
possession then, but there are few
of those cases now,” Stephen said.

But LAC still handles many
additional legal matters brought to
their attention. So, whether you
just got busted or are just

interested in law, LAC could be the
place for you.

Hang Gliding Rising

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

That old Icarean impulse to ﬂy
has manifested itself in a variety of
forins—from gliders to airplanes to
sky diving. Hang gliding is the
latest variation to take wing with the
public.

Basically, hang gliding consists
of strapping yourself to a huge
plastic kite, jumping off a riverside
cliff, and letting the breeze ﬂoat you
down to the water. Besides the
lesser elevation, hang gliding
differs from parachuting in that the
hang glider has slight control over

. s vii 

    

A license is unnecessary for hang
gliding but it is advisable to begin
the sport by joining a club, where
ﬁrst-hand advice is given. The
novice hang glider starts out with
low cliffs and gradually works up in
height and steepness.

Fatalities are surprisingly low;
the major portion stem from faulty
equipment (specifically, not being
strapped in tight enough).

Okay, so why do it, what’s the
thrill? Why lace yourself into a
monkey suit andcrash helmet, then
strap yourself onto a kite—at least
half an hour’s worth of prepara-
tion—for atwo-minute drop into the
Allegheny?

“I guess it’s just the challenge. I
mean it’s like you against the

With Popularity Flying

elements, ’ ’ Allen Bentley said as he
tightened the chin strap‘ on his
ﬂuorescent tangerine helmet.

Bentley's been jumping for more
than two years. During a Labor Day
tournament at a state park called
“The Narrows” (with an elevation
of 2,200 feet and cliffs rated, among
the toughest in the state) he did not
turn in his best effort but made
some deft observations from the
sidelines.

“Last year here, a guy died. He
had a heart attack when he hit the

water. I guess it’s all part of the,

risk. It scares me but I’ve got the
attitude that it just couldn’t happen
to me,” Bentley said.

“I always wanted to ﬂy, but
who’s got the money for airplane
lessons?” he continued. “Gliders
aren’t that common in this part of
the country. Imean, what was left?

' Then I heard a friend of mine talking

about hang gliding and we split the
price for the equipment, got

I together with a couple of friends

and here I am.”

“The big thing to worry about is
that you’re strapped in tight. As
long as you get a good start off the
runway, you’re okay. Last spring,
this kid wasn’t done up right and he
wrecked into the rocks; he didn’t
maintain any momentum and didn’t
even get over the river. He died
almost on impact. People talk about
that one a lot but most of it was his
own stupidity. If he’d checked
everything out, it wouldn't have
happened,” Bentley recalled.

“It’s unbelievable out there,
though,” Bentley said as he edged
up in the line for the runway. “It’s
the most incredible high you can
imagine, just ﬂoating on -air. I know
it only lasts a few minutes at best

. but it just seems like forever. And

then you splash down and it’s over.
Sometimes I worry about getting

days, all three trains ran spaced
about two minutes apart. That
means we had two minutes to
unload and reload 70 to 75 people
onto the train in the station. On
those busy days we just kept
plugging away, usually moving
2,000 people an hour around our
six-minute ride.

Occasionally, our ride would
break down. Each train cab had a
ride operator who faced this
situation with only a tape machine,
cantankerous computer and blink-
ing red lights staring at her. The
breakdowns usually occurred over
the highest parts of the track, 40
feet in the air. All anyone could do
was call maintenance and wait..

Breakdowns didn’t occur too
often, and between mishaps we
prayed for thunderstorms. Light-
ning and thunder meant we had to
shut down our ride, because it is
electrically powered and the
passenger station is full of metal
rail s—-prime targets for strikes from
above. The storms always gave us a
break and sometimes cooled the
temperature by a couple of
degrees.

Most tourists were nice, but there
were always a few crabs in the
bunch. What most people don't
realize is that whenever we took a
while to fix the ride after a
breakdown, or when we cleared
everyone from the station during
storms, we were thinking of the
public’s safety ﬁrst. That is one of
the most important things taught at

orientation and throughout the

season: the public always comes
ﬁrst. .

inevitably, little jokes and
anecdotes helped to get us through
those long hot days; a few laughs
never hurt anyone. We certainly
had our share this summer.

"Sometimes, while working on a

kiddie ride, you realized that it
wasn't the kids who were working
on your nerves, it was their parents.

A number of women asked us if they
could breastfeed their children on
our ride. Some slovenly mothers
allowed ‘their children to relieve
themselves on our platform. People
often left things we would use to

amuse crabby children, like our  

newest mascot, Mac (named after
Fleetwood Mac). And we would
oblige many a guest by holding his
cotton candy or stuffed toy until the
ride was over.

In Trower’s Music

By PHILIP SCALAMOGNA

Robin Trower
In City Dreams
Crysalis

In his new album, ‘‘In City

Dreams,” Robin Trower displays
its heavy rock and blues sound.

Robin Trower, for whom the band is
named, has great talent on the
guitar. As for the other members,
Rustee Allen plays bass, James
Dewar carries the vocals and Bill
Ioroan plays the drums.

“I’ve changed my whole outlook
toward making music,” Robin
Trower said about this album. ‘‘I
decided to concentrate more on
songwriting. I‘m always biased
toward what I like to play on the
guitar, but I decided to spend a lot
more time, energy and effort on
writing and arranging the mater-
ial.”

Among the best selections are
“Somebody Calling,” “Little Girl”
and “Love’s Gonna Bring You

‘€.I“7—lround,” which display a heavy

rhythm and blues sound. James
Dewar’s vocals are rich and deep,
while Robin Trower’s talent on the
guitar is evident.

“Sweet Wine of Love’ ’ has a nice,
easy rhythm and blues beat and
more of Dewar’s ﬁne vocals.
“Bluebird” carries a soft, mellow
sound, enhanced by Trower’s guitar
work, which matches the song’s
soft, sweet mood.

“Falling Star has a heavy rock
suuuu and a gum}-, steady beat

and bass player Rustee Allen.

Robin Trower and his band of the same
name have improved their music with
their latest album.

similar sound but doesn’t credit the
feeling of the others.

Both “Smile” and the title song,
“In City Dreams,” continue the
typical Trower sound.

“I think our lyrics are much more
straightforward on this album,”
Trower said, _“andthere’s deﬁnitely
more melodic content.” The
recording matches his words for ‘ ‘In
City Dreams” contains rich sound,
good enunciation of lyrics and a
strong, steady beat.

Trower has deﬁnitely improved.
The quality of the music and lyrics
surprisingly his surpass previous
albums.

Emmys Still Good
In Delayed Showing

(Continued from Page 16)

Chase but “Saturday Night”
dominated the variety show a-
wards; a montage of film clips from
the show’s funnier moments was
one of the evening’s highlights.
Carroll O’Connor won again as
Archie Bunker for best actor in a
comedy series and James Garner

«~  «best actor in a dramatic series.

“Family’s” Kristy McNicholl got
best supporting’ actress in a
dramatic series and Lindsay
Wagner, “The Bionic Woman,”
won for best actress.

The remainder of the awards
were divided among “Eleanor and
Franklin: The White House
Years,” “Captains and the
Kings,” and “Boy In the Plastic
Bubble.” The latter was a surprise
winner, compared with the headier
competition.

A well-deserved salute to Johnny
Carson rounded out the evening,
complete with a selection of clips
from “The Téiiight Show.”

For once, musical numbers were
pared to a bare minimum. If the
time taken to presenting presenters
also had been trimmed, this would

have ranked among the best of the

Emmy telecasts.

Painfully True Soap Opera

Pin News Staff Writer

The Serial: A Year In The Life of
Marin County

By Cyra McFadden

Alfred A. Knopf

The title describes it best-—“The
Serial: A Year In The Life of Marin
County” is exactly that, a year’s
worth (52 epsiodes) of escapades in
a California county populated by
swinging young couples who have
loads of dough to maintain their
lavish lifestyles.

insists on wearing a Cardin suit (at
least a year too old) against Kate’s
advice and she decides that
“something has to be done about
him.” That something takes the
form of “creative divorce.”

Author Cyra McFadden, herself
a resident of Marin County (and
who since has _been sharply

criticized by her neighbors) has a‘

witty, witchy, sarcastic tone that
pokes fun and dissects both trends
and people with a cutting edge, the
likes of which hasn’t been seen in a

long time. _ 

In fact, McFadden writes like an
updated P. G. Wodehouse, and
Kate Holroyd is exactly like
Wodehouse’s Bertie Wooster from
the “Jeeves” series—an airhead
who, fortunately, can’t see beyond
his own varnished facade.

McFadden’s eye for details is
more than 20-20: “She sat back. in
the 'Eames chair, forced herself to
ignore the roar of Harvey’s compost
grinder, pounding the split-level
and rattling the windows, and
concentrated on her mantra until
she was feeling laid back again. It

_.,_ was just unbelievable how medita-
tion helped her to organize her?’
priorities.” '

McFadden’s wit sparkles
throughout the book——“they could
save a lot of time and energy if they
sat down and ate Harvey’s
paycheck, ﬂamed in brandy, and
eliminated most of the middle-

99

men.

The focus is on a typical Marin
County couple, Kate and Harvey
Holrdyd, who, typically, belong to
-the Sierra Club and are into
Bergman, films and organic cooking,
ten-speed bikes and transcendental
meditation. They also play the old
game of social climbing, which
everyone pretends to ignore as
irreverent and outdated although it
guides every move they make.

At any rate, opulent lifestyle
aside, the Holroyd marriage is in
trouble. While attending the fourth

  Quarterback Root of Pitt Problem

By JIM LEWIS

Pilt News Staff Writer
Against Pitt, William and Mary
has played like the latter. In the

‘four meetings between the two

clubs, the Indians have managed
to score only 17 points—the
Panthers have tallied 108.

‘Needless to say, Pitt has
dominated the series, winning
everygame.

But Saturday, all that can
change. The Tribe has found a
capable quarterback——the

Panthers are still looking.
Tom Rozantz, a 6-2, 190-
pound junior all-Southern

Conference star last season, is a
threat both running and passing.
With the repetoire of tricky plays
William and Mary head coach
Jim Root has installed, Rozantz
can be very dangerous.

But from talking to Root,
you’d think the Indians don’t
stand a chance.

“After playing as poorly as we
did (21-13 loss to Virginia Military
Academy last Saturday),” he
claimed, “then having to go home
and look at films of Pitt, I just
threw up my hands-1 don’t
know where we’ll run against
their defense.’ ’

It wasnt defense that killed W
and M last week, but VMI’s
kicking game.

“We were held back by their

kicking game—we .didn’t make

long sustained drives,” Root said.
“We had some offense going, but
seven times we took the ball
within or behind our own 20-yard

line. We scored one touchdown -

on an 80-yard march, but it’s hard
to do that much more.”

Pitt has the kicking game——and I

the defense, which was brilliant

against Notre Dame in the Irish’s
19-9 victory.

Green Ne wes

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

To say Pitt football player
Hugh Green was excited before the
Panther-Notre Dame game last
Saturday afternoon would be an
understatement.

       

“I expected them to play that
well,” defensive coach Jimmy
Johnson stated. “Even better. We
coaches were prepared and had
more tme to give information to
the players about Notre Dame’s
offense.

“But it’s different now,” he
said about Pitt’s upcoming
contest.

“We have only one week to
prepare for William and Mary.
Plus, we were healthy against the
Irish, but now we have six starters
unable to practice this week.”

The six are Dave Diciccio and
Gary Sylvestri (shoulder), Bob
Gruber and Dave Logan (ankle),
Bob Jury (foot) and Jeff Pelusi
(knee). The question of whether
all will start is still up in the air,
but Johnson isn’t panicking.

“We’1l be ready to play
Saturday,” he said. “We have the
type of character to avoid a
letdown. I don’t feel we have any
pressures on our defense-——we just
have to play our best every
Saturday. We plan to go out and
play our best.’ ’

So the only question mark is at
quarterback, where names are
being thrown around like Matt
Cavanaugh’s passes.

It -seems only two names are
being considered—-—-senior Tom ,
Yewcic and freshman Rick
Trocano, with freshman Lindsay
Delany the dark horse. According
to Sherill, Yewcic has the early
edge. »

-

There he was, a freshman, five
months out of high (school, starting
his first semester of college courses,
and he was getting a starting call at
left defensive end in one of the most
important football games of the
decade.

The kid had to be more

Jackie Sherill is giving everyone a look at quarterback these days--Sue Murphy
has the handoft to Rooster Jones (5) down pat, but can she handle a center snap?

Tom Brzoza is eager to find out.

“Yewcic would be my
quarterback‘ if the game were
played tomorrow,” he stated.
“Of course, we have to change
our offense no matter who plays
and all quarterbacks will have to
work with the center.”

than excited. He had to be ecstatic.

However, none of the above made
Green half as excited as the

realization that he was playing on
national television. Being beamed
on hundreds of thousands, maybe
even millions, of television sets
across the country was a mind-blow-
ing experience for the easy going,
6-2, 212-pounder from Natchez,
Mississippi.

“I’ve never been on national
television,” Green said. “I guess I
wanted to make a great impression.
When I was small, I always had this
dream of playing on national
television. You know, Iguess I was
in complete awe of the Northern
schools. ‘ They always televised
their games down South. I always
thought how nice it would be to play
for a Northern school on national TV
and there I was Saturday, on
television in my first college game.
It was a dream come true.”

If television psyches Green up as
much as it did Saturday, perhaps
Pitt Head Coach Jackie Sherrill
should see that Pitt has all its games
nationally televised for the next four
years or have the Goodyear blimp
circle around Pitt Stadium on game
days. Anything to prevent Green
from suffering a bad case of the
post-television blue. . For if there
was a bright spot in the Panthers’
19-9 setback to the Fighting Irish
Saturday, it was the Pitt defense.
And if there was a surprise on that
defensive unit, it was Hugh (or
“Huge,” as teammates prefer to
call him) Green.

“Cavanaugh is one man we

couldn’t lose,” he continued.’

“Loosing Matt broke everybody.
With him we had a great football

Will Cavanaugh hurry back to
Pitt in two weeks, despite doctors
reports that say he will need six
weeks to heal?

“He is the strongest kid I’ve
been around,” Sherill

we won’t let him play until he’s
ready.”

So it will be {Yewcic or
Trocano stepping behind the
center against the Tribe’s
frequent blitz, a blitz that was
detected and successfully
thwarted by VMI.

After all, Root doesn’t have to
worry——he’s found.a quarterback.

Training Recent Fad
For Women’s Sports

BY MARIA SCIULLO

An athletic trainer is: K
(A) A guy who runs out onto the -football field whenever a player
gets decked.
(B) Someone who traines athletes (obvious answer).

(C) One who has learned the skills necessary for the care and

prevention of injuries in_ sports. -

(D) None of the above. . .

In case you really haven’t the faintest idea, “D” doesn’t answer the
question correctly. Letter “C” comes closest to the real definition.

Actually, according to head women’s athletic trainer Margie
Wendling, the occupation’s title is a misnomer.

“We work- in the field of sports medicine, and what we do is
extremely important,” she said.

Athletic training is fast becoming a popular course of study at Pitt.
Only five or six students worked as trainers last year, compared with
twelve or more this term alone.

Recently introduced at a meeting for female athletes as “someone
we want you to meet under the best of circumstances,” Wendling
earned her BA degree in physical education at Lehman College in
Bronx and received her master’s at Indiana State: She camtﬁ
Pittsburgh two years ago and has_ the responsibility of running the
Trees Hall training room.

“We are fortunate because we are given alllthe supplies we need,
plus a whirlpool, hydroculators, tape and even a new ultrasound
machine. Our only problem is overcrowding,” Wendling said.

Wlth. over 150 women athletes and the members of the men’s
swimming and gymnastic teams using the facilities, at times the room
resembles Towers lobby at noon.

One of the biggest troubles facing trainers is the attitudes of some
athletes, particularly females, toward conditioning and weight-lifting.

_ “In women’s sports you generally find that the girls don’t want to
lift weights because they’re afraid it would make them seem
masculine,” Wendling explained. “Weights are an important part of
conditioning.”

Trainers who work with the Pantherette teams generally don’t ha
to treat dramatic injuries such as those suffered by players on Jackie
Sherrill’s team. Nagging aches and pains, partly due to poor pre-
season conditioning, are more common.

PHILADELPHIA (AP)-—Don’t tell
Phil Garner the National League
East Division race is over.

Garner, the little inﬁelder of the
Pittsburgh Pirates, won’t concede
until the numbers say the Pirates
are going to watch the playoffs on
television.

The 27-year-old Garner knocked
in both Pittsburgh runs Tuesday
night in a 2-0 victory over the
Philadelphia Phillies. Jim Rooker,
with late relief help from Rich
Gossage, earned his 12th win
against nine losses.

The Pirates are now eight games
behind the division-leading Phil-
lies, but are still one step from the
grave. If Garner and his teammates

could ‘win their remaining 16

games, the Phillies would need to
take 10 of 18 to clinch the East title.

"I know it doesn’t look good,”
said Garner, who has hit better than
.400 against Philadelphia pitching
this year. “But stranger things
have happened. We do have a
chance.” Garner then reeled off a
few “ifs” the Pirates need for a
miracle ﬁnish.

‘ ‘ Philadelphia has won more than
50 games at home (56) and they're
due for a little slump. You just don’t
win 50 or more games at home. So if
they lose ﬁve or six now, and if we
win ﬁve or six, it’s a damn good race

again.”

Garner thought about his words
for a few seconds, smiled, and then
added, “I guess that’s a lot of ifs.
Things certainly are not in our

favor.’ ’
Somebody asked Phillies Mana-
ger Danny Ozark if he had given the

if  “3~‘ii“i5i=i‘*‘1“”»iW‘7‘i"”"“l"““““'i i“’ 5”  ..?“‘ ‘P i‘f“5l?t‘i’.7.”’. . _ .............. . . . , .

Garner, Rooker Keep Bucs Alive, 2-0

guy with the shovel the night off.
Ozark had said after the Phillie’s 6-2
win Monday night that the shovel
was digging the grave.

“He didn't bring it (the shovel)
with him tonight (Tuesday), ’ ’ Ozark
replied.

Ozark gave credit to

Jim Hooker notched his 12th victory of the season last night as the Pirates kept

their slim pennant hopes alive with a 2-0 whitewash oi the division-leading Phils.

Rooker for a ﬁne-pitching job.
_“He (Rooker) had good stuff. He
had to, to shut us out.”

Ozark did not look upset. He
obviously feels pretty smug,
needing only a combination of 10
Pittsburgh losses and Phillies’
victories to win a second straight
division title.

The Pirates scored enough to win
in the ﬁrst inning off loser Jim Kaat.
6-9. .Frank Taveras opened the
game with atriple, and scored when
Garner grounded out to the right
side. They made it 2-0 in the sixth
when Rooker singled and scored on
Garner’s two-out triple.

The Phillies’ biggest threat came
in the ﬁfth when Garry Maddox,
who had doubled and been stranded
in the second, led off with a single.
Bob Boone doubled him to third.

But Rooker got -Ted Sizemore to
ground out to third, the runners
holding, and struck out Kaat. With
Jerry Martin at bat, Maddox
attempted to steal home. He

appeared to have the pitch beaten, ‘

but Martin stepped across the
batter’s box and attempted to bunt
thehigh, outside pitch. Martin was
called out for interfering with the

catcher. _ H
“I think I would have made it.

Maddox said. ‘‘It was on the other if
side of the plate. The catcher had to
jump to theo ther side of the plate.
And Jerry had to jump to the °_th°r
side of the batter’s box to hitit.”

Catcher Duffy Dyer admitted it
would have been close. He was
surprised that Martin tried to bunt
the ball.

“I guess it was a natural
reaction,” Dyerconcluded. Martin
refused to discuss the play Wlth
reporters, ducking into the shower.
Later he told a writer. ‘Tm not
talking tonight.” .

After that, the Phillies got 3
two-out single in the sixth by Greg

Luzinski, and a two-out double by;

Larry Bowa in the eighth. _

Bowa’s double brought Pitts-
burgh Manager Chuck Tanner to
the mound to remove Rooker in
place of reliever Gossage.

Gossage retired Mikeschmidt on
a sinking liner to left to end the
inning. _

In the ninth, Liizinski led off with
a w_alk, but was forced by
pinchhitter Jay Johnstone struck
out after fouling off six two-strike
pitches. Gossage earned his 21st
save.

The Pirates-Phillies confronta-
tions for the season ended with
Pittsburgh ahead 10-8.

Dorsett From
Starting Lineup

DALLAS (AP)—Dallas Coach
Tom Landry said Tuesday that
veteran Preston Pearson would be
his starting tailback against Minne-
sota Sunday in a National Football

League opener’, ahead of milliotfg.

dollar rookie Tony Dorsett.

“We’ll spot Dorsett,” said
~ Landry. J ‘He has a lot to learn about
professional football. ”

The Heisman Trophy winner
from Pittsburgh said Tuesday
Pearson deserved the starting job.

Dorsett’ was injured in training
camp and has had some difficulty in
learning the complex kCowboys
system although he has ﬂashed an
occasional brilliance. He gained 99
yards in\a preseason game against
Baltimore.‘

Point attempt-pretty good for
someone who’s been bothered by a
pulled groin muscle and bruised
side since fall camp. It was, in
television terminology, an Emmy-
winning performance.

Although it’s conjecture that_, ‘j.

Neilson ratings went up 10 notches
as a result of Green’s showing, it
certainly raised him on defensive
line coach Jimmy Johnson’s weekly
grading chart. Except for a few
mistakes on his pass coverage
assignments, Green, in both
Sherrill’s and Johnson’s view, had a
“super” game.

“His Pass _d.rops were a little
weak, Sherrill explained, “but
otherwise, he was very well
prepared. He had to be prepared to
do what he did.”

If he wants to keep Green playing

the way he did Saturday, Sherriii”

If 1.. -

might have to do some preparing,
too. Like getting extra television
