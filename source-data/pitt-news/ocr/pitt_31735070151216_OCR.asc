Speakers share tips for positive living

Andrew Fishman
For The Pitt News

Joshua Pollard began his presenta-
tion at the Cathedral of Learning
“on Saturday by having each student
take out his or her cell phone and
send the following message to a
friend: ‘

“I must know what makes me
‘happy, and what I want to be in the
future. I then must see how every
aspect of every day relates to what
will make me happy in the future. I
will then begin to love everything
that happens inmy life because
everything that happens is mak-
ing me better. When I hunt down
the freedom that lies in being in
control of every day, I can have
anything Iwant.”

Pollard, the vice president of
investment banking ﬁrm Gold-
man Sachs, was one _of four Afri-

can—Americans who spoke at the
Black Action Society’s Speaker
Series “Enlighten, Enrich and En-
hance,” an all- day event featuring
motivational speeches that advised
about 20 students how to improve
their outlookon life.

~ Speakers in the series includ-

ed those in the ﬁelds of banking,
medicine and the media. Kimberly
Daye Hardy, a leadership and life-
style strategist, also spoke at the
event. I
Chandel Boozer, Black Action
Student Intercollegiate Struggle
chairwoman of Black Action So-
ciety, hoped the series would
promote cohesion within the Pitt
student body. P -V 3  I
“The ‘rriain goal of the speaker
series is to bring collegiate organi-
zations together as a collective unit
and inspire change amongst one
another,” said Boozer, who helped

organize the event. “[We can begin
to accomplish this by] hearing the
perspectives of professionals and
what they believe the collegiate
community should focus on.”
Pollard said he used the adver-
sity he faced in his life to build a
positive mentality that he adheres
to. The 29-year-old banker saw his
co-workers’ jobs fade into oblivion
before his eyes in 2008 with the
stock market crash. He realized
that his ability to handle situations
differently than those around him
saved his job. Rather than focusing
on the dire state of the banking
industry at the time, Pollard said

, he continued‘ putting effort into

his job.

“Don’t be afraid to be your

own person,” Pollard said. “Don’t
be afraid to break away from the

Avast! Members of Pitt’s Best Bud-
dies club grabbed their mateys,
donned their eye patches and
hooks and set sail on their annual
pirate-themed Midnight Madness
Scavenger Hunt in hopes of scor-
ing some booty for Best Buddies
Pennsylvania and promoting social

— 3 inclusion on Sunday.

The event began at 11 a.m. in
the William Pitt Union and served
as both a bonding experience for
Pitt Best Buddies participants
and a fundraiser for Best Buddies
Pennsylvania, the Pitt chapter’s
umbrella organization. One hun-
dred and forty—four clues, includ-

V ing a treasure section and 14 trivia

questions, routed the participants
around Oakland in a quest to col-
lect the most points and win the
hunt.

After the event kicked off and
teams began planning their routes
in the Kurtzman room of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union, crews of people
wearing dark purple shirts hit the
streets of Oakland, snapping pic-
tures in front of important monu-
ments, high—ﬁving strangers and
collecting donations to rack up
points.

Heather Shiwarski, the pro-
gram manager of Best Buddies,
said the organization is a nonproﬁt
that provides opportunitiesgfor
social inclusion to children and
adults with disabilities, who stu-

crowd.”

Pollard’s other principle for living — ev-
erything happens for a reason and to ﬁnd
a reason in everything —is what helped
him get through a difﬁcult period of going
to work with no guarantee that he would
return the next day. '

“Everything happens for a reason._If I
break my leg right now, the ﬁrst thing I’m
going to say is thank you,” Pollard said. “I’m
going to learn something while I’m sitting in
the hospital with that cast on. That’s going to
make me better. If I keep pressing forward,
I have to learn something.”

Pollard stressed the importance of main-
taining that positive outlook throughout
his talk.

Some of the other speakers also touched
on the subject of race and the troubles mi-
norities face.

Chris Moore, host of WQED’s popular
round table program 4802, also spoke in
the series. Moore —— who leans toward the
ideological left of former Green Party presi-

dential candidate Ralph Nader — describes T

himself asthe only talk show host callers
hang up on because of his unabashed lib-
eral views.

He spoke mostly about stepping out of
your comfort zone, going forward based on
your own attitude and developing an intoler-
ance for bigotry.

“Bigotry is still among us,” Moore said.

Moore said he’s faced his fair share of
bigotry throughout his life. He has turned
that racism into motivation as well as rules
to live by. As an example, Moore cited his
experience after returning from the war.
He said he decided to pursue a career in TV
and radio despite his father telling him that
he’d never obtain a job in those industries
because of the color of his skin.

“Everyone needs to get themselves cre-
atively maladjusted. Get used to surprising
people. You will get told ‘no’ countless times,

.so_prove them wrong,” he said.

While only some of the speakers dealt
with race, all of them spoke about bettering
one’s life, which fell under the ‘enlighten,
enrich and enhance’ theme of the series.
Dr. Keyne Johnson discussed how she was
able to ﬁnd success in her ﬁeld of pediatric
neurosurgery.

“When I think of enlighten, I think of it
through education,”]ohnson said. “You get
an understanding through studying. All this
doesn’t just come. You have to study, and
that’s the hard part. You have your faith. But
faith without work is dead.”

All the speakers provided the attendees
with a multitude of ideas and mentalities
regarding life. Boozer is conﬁdent in the
message this event helped to spread.

“I hope that this event will begin to de-
velop new relationships between individu-
als and organizations,” Bdoier said. “I also
hope it will inspire each individual to take
the information learned and make a posi-
tive change in the collegiate and local com-
munity.” I

BUDDEES

dents take on as their “buddies.”

“A lot of the time for the people in our
program, this might be their ﬁrst opportu-
nity to have a friend,” Shiwarski said.

At the start of the hunt, the club had al-
ready fundraised $1,500 through registra-
tion and donations for the event and was
hoping to have others sign up throughout
the day. In the end, the club had 65 people
register to search for hidden treasure. This
was below their estimated goal, but club
members expected alower turnout because
of the cold weather and a larger event they
held the night before.

Brittany,Bauer, president of Pitt’s Best
Buddies chapter, led one team of students
and buddies on a quest for treasure. Her
team’s strategy was to begin with the clues
that required photos of the entire team. They
already had an advantage over the competi-
tion because they had collected the most
donations, receiving 100 points for every
$5 donated to the cause. .

The team captured more points by hud-
dling in front of Dippy the Dinosaur near

the Carnegie Museum -of Natural History,’

surrounding the fountain in front of the Ca-

thedral of Learning and posing like body
"lSuilders.’ ‘For. each clue, the team takes a

photograph, which is later reviewed to tally
points for the teams. Some photographs
required more imagination, such as a crew
member burying treasure, pretending to be

a bear or posing upside—down.

In the treasure section of the hunt, team
members had to travel through Oakland col-
lecting random items from various locations.
Among the various items they could collect
were straws from ﬁve different places, a sea
shell, three different editions of The Pitt
News and a pink crayon.

Ben Ware, a senior economics major who
has been a member of Best Buddies for two

years, said that staging a sword ﬁght with"

sticks in front of the Cathedral of Learning
was his favorite activity during the hunt.
Over the last two years, Ware has become
very close with his buddy, Dorian.

“.1 didn’t really have much experience
dealing with people with intellectual dis-
abilities before I joined Best Buddies  But
I’ve gotten really close with my buddy  He
loves WWE, and I’ve actually started follow-
ing WWE after being his buddy,” Ware said.

At about noon, a ﬁre alarm interrupted
the event, causingthe evacuation of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union and forcing Bauer’s team to
postpone its original plan to tackle the clue
“a crew member with as many different pan-
thers around campus” until he and his team

members were allowed backinto the Union.

Just after the evacuation, Bauer expressed
the frequency with which the Best Buddies
have to work under the motto “just go with
it” and practice ﬂexibility during events.
The club re—entered the Union by 1:30 p.m.
for its scheduled lunch time. I

bleak. The younger generations

and “they’re.”

And now that the militant cor-
rections of autocorrect have re-
placed the squiggle of Microsoft
Word, we are going even deeper
down the rabbit hole.

cal decency

The Microsoft Word problem
is obvious and well-documented.
It tells us when we have misused
“it’s” or “its,” or “to” versus
“too.” Helpful Microsoft Word
gives us a squiggle when we have
either made a simple typo or an
honest mistake.

But we have become reliant on
the squiggle. This causes prob-
lems when the syntactical mis-
takes are larger and not part of
the standard repertoire of spell-
ing fails. For example, take the
phrase “Josh walked right passed
the hotel.” “Passed” should be
“past” because I am saying that

 Josh has continued to walk be-

yond the intended stopping
point. However, this-m~i»stak_ejof-
ten ‘goes unreco’gnized'.’With our
guard only raised at the sight of a
squiggle, these errors plague our
”written communication.

But with autocorrect, there is
eveniless reason to remain alert.
Solutions are simply inserted to
create what is statistically most
likely to be the correct sentence.

While this might make things
better on average, it also leads to
unfortunate errors.

T:?l<Pif6ATE  

For instance, if I’m typing an email on
my iPhone and want to say “its,” a posses-
sive pronoun, iOS6 automatically corrects
the word to “it’s,” meaning “it is.” So now,
the dog is chewing on “it is” bone, rather
than the bone that the dog owns.

E_rrors like this flow endlessly from our
mobile devices. And yet the world some-
how seems not to care. Are we‘ just too
lazy to actually put thought behind our
communication? 1 would like to think that
the average person at age 20 knows the
difference between “our” and “are.” But
my observations on social media and other

electronic communication outlets lead me
to believe the contrary. Years of squiggle
searching have made it impossible to cor-
rect ourselves when the machines need to
be corrected. .

This is not without effect. According
to the Wall Street Journal, ever—looser

language usage has affected the business ,

world, ruining marketing materials and
leaving clients with bad impressions.
Mindless adherenceittoltimachines is cost-
ing us money. i 

The quick fix? There isn’t one. This
warrants a certain kind of bluntness: Learn
the differences. Figure it out. You need to
be able to spot these mistakes as easilyvas
you would notice your own name blatantly
misspelled or as quickly as you reply to

 

that text message you’ve been anticipating.

Do you want to send your future boss an
email with mistakes an 8-year-old should
be able to spot? Doyou, as a«boss»to~ot=h-
ers, want to send a message with a mistake
egregious enough to cause your staff to
roll its eyes atyour evident incompetence?

It’s time to relearn the art of proofread-
ing. Of course, this starts with important
documents or messages, but should also
include an extra two seconds spent on that

text message to get in-the habit of noticing ,

any mistakes.

Perhaps before clicking to see the ed-
iting suggestions Microsoft Word has to
offer, you can assess your mistake ﬁrst.
“Your the best?” Obviously you aren’t the
best at spelling: Let’s think.

The best prescription for chronic spell-
ing failures I have to offer is something

expose ourselves to the richness of the
English language. By seeing proper word
usage, such as where contractions and
possessives are not interchanged, we can
begin to better recognize what words look
correct in our own writings. ‘

Of course, everyone will slip and have
a typo at some point. We’re only human.
But the machines we use aren’t foolproof
either. I

SPRING FOOTBALL

Savage seeks to succeed Sunseri s Pitt quarterback 

Dave Uhrmacher
Staff Wrz‘ter

Like the Steelers’ Ben Roethlisberger, a
quarterback wearing No. 7 could start next
season for the Pitt football team.

Redshirt senior Tom Savage might be
the man to replace three—year starter Tino
Sunseri and lead the Panthers into their
ﬁrst Atlantic Coast Conference game when
they host Florida State on Labor Day.

After beginning his promising career
at Rutgers, the five-star recruit, who
earned Freshman All-American honors
with the Scarlet Knights, transferred to
Arizona following his sophomore season.
A coaching change before Savage even
set foot» on Arizona’s campus resulted in
another change of plans for the 6-foot-5,
230—pound pocket passer.

Coping with adversity, he settled on
Pitt, citing a great opportunity to play
for head coach Paul Chryst and his staff
—who also coached Savage’s brother at
Wisconsin —— and to finish out his col-
legiate career on a high note.

The Pitt News talked with Savage fol-
lowing arecent spring football practice
about the upcoming season and what his
skill set can bring to the table for the Pan-
thers in 2013.

The Pitt News: Some fans might be unfa-
miliar with your playing style, so can you
tell us the kind of quarterback you areand
what style of offense you operate’ best in?
Tom Savage: This offense is the one for
me. I am a pro—style quarterback, so, yeah,
that’s about it.

TPN: What things are you working on
speciﬁcally this spring to improve upon
your individual play at Rutgersrduring

your freshman year, when you earned-I _

Freshman All-American Honors‘?
TS: You can always improve, but I think

you can always -improve footwork [and]
accuracy — pretty much everything. I
have been out of the game for two years
now, so I am just trying to polish up ev-
erything.

TPN: With one of the most exciting and
challenging schedules in the nation next
season, what game or games are you most
looking forward to being a part of?

TS: All of them, I know it is cliche but all
of them.

TPN: Citing coach Chryst’s past successes

in developing quarterbacks, are you excit-.

ed for the opportunity to run his system?
TS: Yeah, I deﬁnitely am. Coach Chryst’s
offense is awesome, and I am excited to
get out there and play.

TPN: Having to sit out for such an ex-
tended period of time after transferring
twice, do you think you are at any sort of
disadvantage because you have not played
in a game since 2010?

TS: Obviously you need to get out there
and make the decisions and play under the
lights, but.I have been going against the
first-team defense for the last two years
now [in practice].

if Practice notes from Friday, March 22:
- — Savage took all the snaps with the first-
..team offense during the first scrimmage

in spring practices and appears to be the
early front-runner for the starting quar-
terback job. -

— Chryst and the Panthers hosted ACC
head of football officials Doug_Rhoads and
a crew of referees to call their scrimmage.

— Pitt commits and Clairton high school '

teammates Tyler Boyd, Terrish Webb and

Titus Howard were in attendance, observ-

ing practice from the sideline-

Pitt seniors Wﬂps, Thomusseit earn All-American status

Dustin Gabler ’
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

The Pitt wrestling team went to the NCAA
championships with one goal: to ﬁnish in the

' top 10 nationally.

While the 30 team points Pitt earned only
merited a 15th—place ﬁnish this weekend in
Des Moines, Iowa, two Panthers were named
All-Americans. ’

Pitt seniors Matt Wilps and Zac Thomus— I

seit arrived at the NCAA championships with
hopes of becoming All-Americans and ac-

complished that goal. ~   - P 

But the 197-pound heavyweight wrestlers
both came up just short of competing in the
national championship match, with Wilps

The rubber match ended not with a pin, but

Wilps returned to the mat the next day for I

two dominating victories — a 9-2 triufnph
over Iowa State’s Kyven Gadson and a 17-2
technical fall against Oregon State’s Taylor
Meeks to secure a third-place ﬁnish. His third-
place ﬁnish earned him All-American status
for the second—straight year.

Thomusseit’s championship chances also
ended in an overtim‘e ﬁnale.

After winning his ﬁrst two matches 6-0,
Thomusseit faced top—seeded heavyweight
Dom Bradley of The University of Missouri
in the quarterﬁnals.

Bradley, who signiﬁcantly outweighed
Thomusseit, traded escapes with Thomus-
seit and headed to overtime with the score
tied at 1.

The Pitt senior attempted a few take—
downs, but Bradley scrambled away to avoid
giving Thomusseit the two points.

In overtime, Bradley escaped quickly from
Thomusseit in his period down, but Thomus-
seit failed to escape from Bradley, ending
Thomusseit’s chances at a national champion-
ship with a 2-1 defeat.

Thomusseit expressed'his frustration at
losing a low-scoring match.

“I hate wrestling big guys that just stand
around and don’t take any risks. Bradley just
waits to go to overtime and win in ride out,”
Thomusseit said. “I stuck to my game plan
pretty well. I wanted to keep the pressure
on him the whole match and score a late

takedown. I knew I would only have a couple
opportunities to score, and Iwasn’t able, to.”
Thomusseit won a consolation match to
secure his All-American status but fell 4-3
in the consolation semiﬁnals to advance for
a shot at the third-place match. Instead, he
fell to the ﬁfth—place match, in which he won
3-1 over Central Michigan’s Jarod Trice and
claimed ﬁfth place.
Despite losing in the quarterﬁnals, Tho-
musseit still felt proud of his performance.
“I can’t sayI have any regrets,” he said. “It
was my last tournament, and I laid it all out
there and gave it everythingl had. course
I wanted to win, but a couple things didn’t go
my way. But I’m still holding my head high.”

SAVAGE

— The Panthers’ starting offensive line
during the scrimmage went as follows:
Adam Bisnowaty (left tackle), Cory King

"(left"guard), Gabe Roberts (center), Matt

Rotheram (right guard) and T.]. Clem-
mings (right tackle). '

—- Sophomore running back Rushel Shell
showed flashes of brilliance, including a
15—yard run in which he broke four tackles
in the process.

— Redshirt junior Anthony Gonzalez,
making the transition from safety to
linebacker, played a spirited game in the
first 11-on—11 contest of spring practice.
He had multiple impact plays, including
a forced fumble.

-— Redshirt senior Ed Tinker played well
as he continues to fight for the starting
wide receiver job opposite Devin Street.
“[Tinker} has ﬂashed on some things, and
they are so tricky because on a scrimmage
day, when does the ball come your way?
Over the course of the spring, he has to put
himself in position to be a contributor,”
Chryst said after practice.

—— Two tight ends, Scott Orndoff and
Manasseh Garner, had big touchdown
catches during the scrimmage period, and
both demonstrated the ability to come off
the line and catch the ball well in traffic.
— Pitt’s annual spring game begins at
noon Friday, April 12. The game will take

' place at Bethel Park High School. I
