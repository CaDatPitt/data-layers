Director Kelly Just Knows Shim-Sham
Routine Will ‘Stand ’Em In The Aisles’

 

“In :‘;z:- Soup's” (lance routines,
s:.agotl and supervised by Gene Kelly,
(".'31, Cap and Gown dance director,
are e::pecr.ell to approach professional
dancing snore nearly than ever before
in club proeluctions.

Cap and Gowu’s dancing was aided
nreatly in 1929, when William Mar-
‘l’-.tt, for-‘.1zei'ly connected with the
Shuberts and Jolm Murray Anderson
in New York, came to Pitt to direct
"‘Manl1a.t,’.::.:,u Preterred.”

This year Cap and Gown has a real
“break” in that it has men to direct
both the book and the dancing. Theo-
(lore Vlelunan, who recently staged
tliedrlarvard “Hasty Pudding” show,
is directing the book, giving Kelly full

time for routines.

The new dances which will not de-
pend on staging and lighting for ef-
fect, include a military formation
routine, a complicated time step, a
graceful waltz number, a southern
shim-sham. and other steps still in
the formulative stage.

Kelly, in commenting on the musi-
cal comedy’s dancing. said:

“ ‘In the Soup’s’ dance routines will
stand them in the aisles, I am more
than satistied with the progress of the
show and the enthusiasm shown by
the fello‘-.'~'.s. Vlfatch especially for the
shim-sham number to the tune of ‘It
Ain't No Lie.’ The individual special-
ty numbers also merit three-star rat-
ings.”

Academic Black

‘ ENIORS were asked last Week

’ to submit speciﬁcations for the
academic caps and gowns they
will wear at Cominencement on
June 6.

Head size, chest measureincnt,
weiglit. and height are some of the
important. considerations. So is
the color of the tassel, worn on
the mortar board, which distin-
guislies the graduates of one
School from those of another.

No mention is made of the fact.
that the Cominencement costume
will be fimdamentally black, but
perhaps that fact is too well
known for cominent in a letter to
seniors. Or perhaps there is an
awkward symbolism to the color.

\Vhile the grrass is g‘ett.ing
greener and While hopeful per-
sons go on trusting‘ the sky is
getting‘ bluer, for miive'i'sities to
turn their graduates out in black
is deﬁnitely macabre.

Lloyd Dates On Day At City Chambers
And Weeps Over Fate Of Gold Eagle

 

By'Alan C. Lloyd
In the eagled, paneled chambers of

the city,

It is commonly agreed ’twould be a
pity

If no fearful, awful, horrid revela-
tion

Should ensue from all this current
litigation.

Throughout the state:the :public eye
has focused
On the group of men, the very best
(and broke-st)
That the democrats could get to
come and sit
Like quintuplets investigating Pitt.
:3: It *
Before that noble
gators
Is a grinning group of glut"cons—-
alligators
Thusly grove! in the livid and slime,
And enjoy, I say, a litter-ly liberal

board of dele-

And one by one, while I expectorate,
They glibly gib, and yet expect to

rat

Although they all (as we expect)

crate ,

With heartless words that rise ex-

pectorate.

I give condolence to the earnest
men

wnose place in public life has set
them in

Where they must pose as that
authority

Which harkens most to l:-rayest
minority.

That eagle on the chamber’s paneled
wall,

With wings outspread to hover o’er
us all,

Must wince beneath the pain, the
flutter of shame,
To smell such stink stirred up in

freedom’s name!

Last 'l‘l1ursda)', Arthur Brisbane.
sneering at the peace demonstration
of the students, said, “It will be time

ienougli for the young gentlemen to

we-rry about war when it comes, and

‘iii it does come, as they were born in

America, and are not equipped with
white livers, they will go out and
ﬁght ‘as usual,’ however much they

may regret the possibility of not
coming back. Man is a vﬁghting ani-
mal.”

Mr. BrisLlane, of course, is just an
old man. He needn’t worry. Perhaps,
if he and others of the same genera-
tion had worried, the last war might.
have been prevented.

Mr. Brisbane’s idea of a man. is an
angel with artiﬁcial wings, loaded
with explosives. Is a black liver as
good as a. white one?

Walt Whitman had ideas about
animals. too. Mr, Brisbane would do
well to write a review on Vvliitman,
and learn soinetliing about the amia-
hility of cats and dogs. Has anyone

r.oi:iicei(l how rapidly’predatory"beasts‘

are going ,out of style?

We've heard a lot about the fighting
soul;

We wonder what it means to brag
of such.

is it conducive most of ghoul or
goal?

The spirit docsn’t strike me as so
much!

It's nice to have the glory and the

praise.

It's nice to make your mother, oh
so proud!

But it’s nicer to admit throughout
your days

That you love.d...your. mother.-more
