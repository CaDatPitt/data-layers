Cundra Faces

Last December I agreed to seek
.he office of president of Student
Government. I felt that past SGs
were absurd bodies which at best
represented only whims of a small
clique and were out of touch with
student needs. I was determined
to change that image and that
function. After two hotly-contest-
ed elections. I emerged as the new
president-elect of SG. '

Although my primary concern
was the fiscal crisis of the ‘Univer-
sity. I immediately began to clean
house and “open-up" SG. All in-
terested students were encour-
aged to apply for committee posts.
a practice which was "not de-
sired in previous years.

I began an investigation of Win‘-
ter Weekend. which showed a pre-
liminary finding of a possible $17,-
000 debt and the‘ possible misuse
of complimentary tickets for per-
sonal financial gain. I began to
look into an alleged $3.000 em-
bezzlement in the Pitt News
business office, and I also start-
ed a check into the financial ar-
rangement of a SG trip to‘ El
Paso and Mexico last summer
for an NSA conference. —

In addition to this I started
work on one of my campaign
promises by beginning an inves-
tigation into the necessity of the
increase in the students activi-
ties fee from six to eight dollars.
Needless to say, these investiga-
tions and possible disclosures -did
not meet with acceptance by the
‘people involved, and prompted
one of them to warn me to “lay
off” because they had “more
power" than I'd ever have.”

I

I was returning from Harris-
burg last Wednesday as the most
recent allegations were being pre-
sented to Mr. Kobosky. I was in

Harrisburg trying to pressure leg-

islators to pass Pitts appropria-
tions.‘ -

I felt then and I still‘ feel now

that this was more important than V

my own personal affairs. It was
for this reason that-I returned to
Harrisburg early Thursday af-
ternoon after receiving a call from

the Pitt commonwealth represen-,

tative late Wednesday night. ra-
ther than stay in Pittsburgh and
involve myself with these alleged
offences. ’ ‘ . -

In answer to these allegations
that Miss Davis presented in the
Pitt N ews,/I would first like to say
that not only were John \Cavaluchy

and I unaware of the “illegality of -

our funding procedure from the

very beginning” but- we are still’

unaware of the illegality. The USC
party did not spend more than the
$196.22 that we declared in our fi-
nancial statement and have been
censured for. The $1,000 expendi-
ture that is mentioned by Miss Da-
vis was spent by the Committee
for Effective. Student-Government
which had and was responsible for
its own funds even though those
funds were placed in the personal
account of Miss Davis. This can
be proven by Miss Davis’ cancel-
led checks and ledgers, which

have always been a matter of :pll_b- _ V

lie record and would havelgladly
been presented. at ‘the first in-'
quiry had they been requested.
Thisfact alone shows that a new
investigation into these old

charges is not only unwanted, but
violates all legal precedence and,

consequently, the SG election code.

I WILL NOT RESIGN. I will in-'
stead stand up and face those
same charges. I have shown that
I have nothing to hide. To quit

would violate my ‘principles -and‘

the ideals to which I adhere. I sin-
cerely hope that the case in ques-

tion, which is nothing more than a ‘

‘repeat of the first charges brought
‘by theElection Committee, will

- be judged on the factsxl will not‘
engage in a "‘tria__l by press." Nor-

(Editor's Note:'This statement from Cundra’s party is the response to
a statement published in the Friday, Feb. 27, issue of The Pitt News, in
which incumbent SG President Scott Baum announced that he would not

inaugurate the president-elect until Jhelcontroversial SG dispute was.

cleared up.)

V The Student Government Election held on February 4. 1970. was
deemed valid‘by both the SG Election‘ Committee and the administra-

tion review committee.

Also..all those candidates receiving a plurality of votes in that elec-
tion were certified to be (a) duly qualified for their respective positions

in accordance with the SG Constitution Article IV. Section 3 and 4 and‘

Article VIII. Section 4. and (bi duly elected to their respective offices:
The Supreme Court of Minnesota ruled March 6. 1931 (235. NW.

526). that:

The rule is well established thatone who has been elected, and has
qualified, is entitled to possession of the office until and unless his elec-
tion has been set aside in a.direct attack, by election contest or quo-war-.

Therefore. Steven Cundra and all those candidates who received a
plurality of votes in the latest SG election not only possess the privilege
to the use the SG offices in accordance with SG regulations, but are also
obligated to conduct the necessary business of that office. _- . 2 

Furthermore, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in Fox McDo

ald:

- If a person has been informally appointed and has official acts done
under.it, or if he has acted without qualification, his acts are validated
by law as an officer‘de facto, and no extent of radification by ithe
appointing power (such as the administering’ of an oath of office)

could add anything to their validity.

So, usingthis precedent, Mr. Cundra and all of the other elected .
candidates can officially act as .a, Student Government officer and per- ‘‘
form such duties as necessarily pertain to their office and which are,

enumerated invthe SG Constitution.

According to Director Holmok.

' In the same time span. 600 to

The company representatives
hold 10,000 personal interview
sessions with job-hunting stu-
dents, interviewing those with
bachelor degrees. masters‘ and
Ph.D’s.

“In a bad day." remarked Hol-
mok, “there are 23 companies on
campus interviewing 14 students
each for positions."

-Assistant director from 1960-
69. the new boss of the Placement
Center. outlined the registration

prior to the actual recruiting. Hol-
mok holds a series of briefing ses-
sions. dividing students into'the
categories of their educational
backgrounds. and lets them ‘in on
what to expect from the inter-
views. '

Two weeks before a specific
company is to recruit on the cam-
pus. the time schedule of its inter-
viewers is posted in the main of-
fice of the Placement Center and
students are requested to sign in
appropriate slots.

The average student. claims the

director. takes 10-12 interviews"

in the three month period. with a
few seeing as many as 20 com-
pany representatives. If the job-
hunter wins the approval of the
interviewer. he is taken on a plant
trip where higher-ups say the fi-
nal yes or no on his hiring.

A Half Success Story
The success of the center va-

‘ries with the educational back-

ground of the applicants. The em-
ployment rate of graduating sen-
iors in the sciences and engineer-
ing is very high. revealed Holmok.
while liberal arts majors have
about a 50 per cent success story.

Although Title VII of the equal
opportunity regulations prohibit
job discrimination on the basis of
sex. women have a tougher time
getting hired than men. Holmok
continued. No company lists ‘sex
as a requirement. but the sales
and traveling jobs are more apt
to recruit males than females.
Holmok cited the example of one

company that places men direct— ‘

ly into sales. positions but rele-
gates females into marketing re-
search jobs. - E

_ Although most companies show...

no real bias. believed ‘Director
Holmok. "women are just not in
the same demand and don’t "al-
ways want the jobs that men will

accept. "

The Placement Center works in
coordination with the Student
Counseling Center to provide vo-
cational counseling and a compre-
hensive library of employment in-
formation. -including background

by DAVE TIE RNAN
Editor

_ Usually, the outgoing editor writes
one farewell piece for the paper. Since
I don’t feel I could possibly say all I
have to say in one article, I’ll start with

L this, and see how many more
installations I‘ll need to get it all out of
my system before I leave.

First, my opinion of students. They
are generally too status conscious, to
concerned with what their peers say
and do to think about what they
themselves want to do or be. The influx
of “plastic” hippies here in the past
few years has been amazing. But
students still get their hair cut and put
on their best three piece suit for job
interviews.

Same with guys and the draft. Sure
it is easy for me to say “resist”, be-
cause I have already served my time.
But to me, it’s like the old saying," i
“shit or get off the pot" (no pun intend-
ed). I mean, if guys are going to let the
‘draft fuck their minds up to the extent
that they can’t think of anything else
for two or three years, then it’s
definately worth thinking about the
resistance. But no, that's too radical.
Better to hassle the whole thing for a
few years than to do something drastic.

‘And when I suggest that if a substantial
number of guys resisted, there would
be no draft, no army, people look at me
like I’m crazy.

...THEN THERE are the “husband-
seekers". They make me sick, but what
are you going to do? Chicks will do any-
thing—join the Revolutionary Socialist
Union—to snag a mate_ for life. Yes, the
Woman’s Liberation will scream that
I’m a male supremist, but I’ve yet to
meet a chick who places
anything——even the liberation business
— ahead of grabbing off a guy.

The University As A Microsm

Many people here like to look at the
University as a microsm of society.
Yes it most deffinately is. Too bad. For
to me, life is composed of old people, or
people who think they are getting older
every day, who are scared shitless of
new things which threaten their
established and cherished customs.

 

 

 

/I ‘

You know, it’s like the "creeps who
truck on down to church every Sunday,
then after services ‘go on for hours
about the “niggers" and the
“communist punks" who are threa-
tening this wonderful country.

Well, if you happen to have been
born on the right side of the tracks,
then this is a wonderful country. But
what about the rest? Don’t they count?
Are laws just only as long as they
protect the elite? For how many people
does Mrs. John Mitchell speak when
she says “Until I saw those white
helmets lined up in front of our building
(during the recent demonstration in
Washington, D. C.), I never realized
how well protected we really are in this
country”? How often do those white
helmets line up to insure the rights of
the minority groups in this country?

BUT THAT’S mere rambling. Let's
get back to the students of our own Uni-
versity because it produces “hippies"
and “pinko profs". That’s cool. There
are other students . who th i n k
grading shouldn’t be abolished because
there’s no other way to evaluate
graduate school applicants than
through grades. That's real cool. There
are students here who think it's
perfectly legitimate to spend over $1000
to win a Student Government election.
even though the Student Government
Elections Code states specifically that
no party may spend over $200, because
they feel the “powers-to-be” in the past
have been dishonest and corrupt. Right
on.

Scared Students Make Scared Parents

Oh yes, we have all kinds of students
here. All scared. Scared of their future,
scared of their sexual prowess, scared
of their peers, scared of everything,
including change. And they will leave
here and become scared parents, and
scared citizens, just plain scared
people. But they'll never do anything to
change their plight.

-"Peering” To The Future

...LIKE THEIR parents, they’ll be
scared of communism, without
realizing that the political machines in
this country are stronger than any
communistic party in the world
(contrary to what the pig press says in
its propaganda); they‘ll be scared of
their children, just like their parents
were scared of them; they’ll end up
like their parents, dittin' in their
mortgaged homes, thinkin' about their
car payments and fucked—up kids, and
watchin' all the crazy people
demonstrate, for their rights on their
colored televisions.

EASY RIDER or as Putney Swope
prove, revolutions only last for ‘a
second. After that they become
watered down, diluted, spread out,
fucked up. The revolution in this
country ended the second it started,
and the rich pigs will rule this country

-as long-as it exists. And students here

are striving with all they have to

become rich pigs. Good luck, fuck—offs..

Few “Thinkers” Here

But not all the kids here are as bad
as I would like to think. There are some
good heads here, and I’ll miss them
when I‘m gone; But, like most good
things, there’s more where these came
from. When the University became

. staterelated it gave a lot. up in its out-

of-state students.

NOT THAT NEW York Jews. are
any better than Pittsburgh Jews, its the
leaving home, the reading of two
newspapers instead of one,’ the friends
at other schools, the independence, the
having to break the parental ties, that
makes the out-of-staters more aware
that the home town folks.

For that reason, the lack of out-of-
state students, I predict the decline of
not only Pitt, but every university in
the country that accommodates local
students with second rate educations

Voice From The Ghetto

with state funds. The whole concept
only perpetuates the idea of going to
college to get a degree or a husband
rather than an education.

Good heads here are put down—put
down by the teachers, put down by the
administration, put down by the other
students, and most of all, put down by
the pigs. One gets hassled for long hair,
drugs, demonstrations; yet the bars
continue to serve the clean—cut (yet

under age) group, local proprietor);

write numbers, traffic tickets get
fixed, the racketeers run the city—and
where are the pigs? They’re out
hassling long hairs who’d “rather
switch that fight".

Change Is A Long Time Coming

But change is a long time in coming.
This year John Wayne and Peggy Lee
may win awards that they never won
twenty years ago. That’s the way
change comes to this country. The
American Football League had a good
thing, but the second it threatened the
“establishment” (K (‘the National
Football League) it got usurped.»/and
now will function under established
rules, in established cities, with

established people making the res,-:_~.

profits that the “revolutionaries”
worked ten years to make. ’

Same here. As soon as the Open Uni-
versity became a threat to the Univer-
sity, the University immediately
provided space and other tidbits and
soon the Open University became part
of the real University, and all the hard
work-of those in the Open University
was usurped by “the establishment”.

So, kiddies, I predict that you will be
usurped before you stand up for what

you believe in. You will hassle the draffgﬁ»
or get married before you will think fo1‘""“"‘

yourselves. You will end up like your
parents — scared — before you have
the guts to be individuals. Again, good
luck. ‘

Contributing Writer

What’s your reaction to that phrase, "Black
Power"? Most people envision millions of Black
men running up~their street, killing and raping
their wives and children. burning homes and
stores, and leaving nothing in their wake. The
really sad partabout all that is that I'm not ex-
aggerating. Countless Americans, men and wom-
en. have bought guns and taken lessons on (how-
to fight such an attempted takeover by the Black
man. Perverse militia groups have sprung up to
protect people from a possible Black revolution.

But _the Black Power movement is not. a
threat. It is a cry for identity and justice for
the people America‘ has been stepping on for
hundreds of years». ~

The first goal. identity. is something that has
been denied the Negro since he was brought
to this country. Every other ethnic group, i.e.
Irish. Italians. and Jews, banned together for
years. spoke their own language. built their own
communities. shopped at their own stores. ate
their own foods. and otherwise kept alive their
cultural heritage until they could blend into
the melting pot that is America. bringing all
these wonderful things with them. Not so with
the Africans. '

...Slavery stripped them ‘of their colorful cloth-
ing. macabre dances. native foods. and even
their gods. and gave them only the anemic cul-

‘ ture of the White Protestant South. Not even

theifamily structure was maintained; husbands
and wives. mothers and fathers. were separated
and interbred. The woman, became the princi-
pal authority figure in therfamily. and the men
_bor’,, and, _breeding.;_

women. until Black America became matriar-

chal, as it is to this day.

With all these things gone, -we then tried to‘
make the Negro think he' was,White (which
wouldn't have been nearly so bad if we had
granted him the same privileges that White men
enjoyed). He ate “White" food’, followed every
directive of the white masters, went to schools
with “White" lessons from" ‘_'White" textbooks,
read "White" newspapers and magazines and
watched “White" television programs. My God,
is it any wonder that they are today searching
for an identity in. a society that won’t" accept
them because their skin is_n’t White. Will they
be able to forgive us for stripping their beauti-
ful Black children of their free spirits? '

. . .Preschool

them and known them to have a sense of naked,
freedom and trust and honesty that surpasses
even the beauty we know our own little ones to
have. That's the only thing the White man has
never been able to squelch. '

...Now that I think of it, peoplewho suggest
sending the Negroes back to Africa are very
close to the solution.) We have to let them go
back three-hundred years in time to trace their
lineage and recapture the rich culture they
lost on their journey acrossthe ocean.

We must permit them to educate themselves

in African history and the like. And thenwe I
' can watch in awe as they unveil themselves to 2
us as a. unified. beautiful ‘people. ready to,-,.. ,

Mr. Senio

Is Dangerous

Editor. The Pitt News:

I have a tendency to doubt the
authenticity of several statements
made by Allan Senio in a recent
letter to the editor of The Pitt

News. To quote a phrase of Se— .

nio‘s: "all the bickering . . . is fu-
tile exercise in rhetoric" if the
facts are not straight and secure.

**.-'-»I think Senio goes beyond the
bounds in creating too many gen-
eralizations. Two statements that
show a lack of awareness on Se-
nio's part are his generalizations
that all Profs are "Pinkos" and
that all steel workers feel that
college kids are “a buncha-draft
dodging commie queers." I think.
Mr. Senio. that you will have a dif-
ficult time proving these.

You have a tendency to degrade
yourself by associating with such
American stalwarts as George C.
Wallace and Spiro T. Agnew. Af-
ter all. Agnew. at one time. made
the statement that if you‘ve seen
one ghetto you‘ve seen them all.

 Wallace still refuses to rec-

ognize a problem between the
races in this country. Just by
looking out your window.gMr. ~Se—
nio. you'll see that both of these
* statements reek with alack of re-
search and understanding of cur-
: rent problems.

-Another discrepancy in your ar-
ticle is that you reveal a certain
amount of hypocrisy by condemn-
ing the University society and then
continuing to live in it. without
trying to change it. I mean. what

I gore you doing here if youfeel Pitt

is trying to. brainwash you? To
me. you are a hypocrite.

I don't mean to put you down.
but rather put you into perspec-
tive. To paraphrase Judge Julius
Hoffman. you are a very danger-
ous man. ‘ .\

Equal Pay
For Equal

Work U rgerl

Editor. The Pitt News:

The University Committee for
Women’s Rights wishes to extend
its support to the organization of
technical and clerical employees
at the University of Pittsburgh.
Wages and benefits for these em-
ployees are exceedingly low. Sal-
aries have not been
even at the rate of inflation. not to
mention that an actual increment
ought to be received for_ develop-
ment in skill. experience. and for
years of service.

Every organization has to set
priorities and these priorities are
usually determined by the de-
mands placed upon the organiza-
tion. Hence. forrthe position of em-
ployees of the University to be
improved. it is essential that
these employees work together in
placing their demands and in
working out solutions for existing
injustices. ’ A

We hope the University will re-
spond positively to.thei organiza-
tion of 1199 by clerical and tech-
nical employees and will work
with them in raisingsalaries and
providing benefits which will in.
turn improve the functioning of
the University and of the Pitts-
burgh community.

ls Carswell
A Hard Core
White Racist?

Editor. The Pitt News:

Read the letter of George Bald-_

erose (The Pitt News, Feb. 27 ».
While iticertainly is permissi-
ble to investigate Supreme Court
nominees. I should think that it is
also permissible to investigate
people holding top secret govern-
ment jobs. That‘s what McCarthy
attempted to do. Unfortunately.

‘ while his goal was worthy ielim-'

inating Communists from the gov-
ernmentl. his tactics were often
crude and excessive. His evidence
was usually flimsy. And thus my
parallel with Carswell. In a noble
attempt to have top quality judges
on the’Supreme Court. the evi-
dence certain people have thus
far used against the judge is flim-
syindeed.

The big knock against'Judge
Carswell is his "white suprema-
cy” speech 21 years ago. He al-
ready has repudiated that state-
ment. calling it "obnoxious and
abhorrent to my personal be-
liefs."_ I

Wednesday, Marcli.4, 1970-THE PIT'riNEws—Péngé 5

 0 M7  U T” R (Ell d8 T8 5 8  It 

Certainly a man can change his
mind over time. John Dos Passos.
James Burnham and Phillip Ab-
bot Luce will testify to this fact.
Look at some of Carswell‘s rul-
ings. In 1960. for instance. he or-
dered immediate desegregation
of thecounters. waiting rooms.
and rest rooms of the city-owned
airport in Tallahassee. In 1965.
he declared that the barbershop
in Tallahassees Deuval Hotel had
to serve Negroes under the public
accommodations provision of the
1964 Civil Rights Act. Really now.
the actions of a hard core racist?

Were we to hold everyone re-
sponsible for everything that
might be said in the heat of a cam-
paign. we would have to indict:

Jackie Robinson: ‘‘I now believe I
know how it felt to be a Jew in
Hitler's Germany . . .”

Senator Fullbright: “Goldwater Re-
publicanism is the closest thing in
American politics to an equiva-
lent of Russian StaIinism.”

Martin Luther King: “There are dan-
gerous signs of Hitlerism in the
‘ Goldwater campaign.” ‘

or
“America is the greatest purvey-
or, of violence in the world today.”

Mayor Lindsay (on the March pri-
mary victory): The voices of
doubt and fear cannot be permit-
ted to govern this city.”

And_ these people have never
repudiated‘ these statements.

A man should be judged for the
Supreme Court on his judicial
qualifications. not on something
he said 20 years ago and later re-
pudiated. If everyonein public life
were to be judged by the criteria
that some use to evaluate Cars-
well. there wouldn't be very many
people left in public life.

ROTC Publications Staff

Under the direction of Staff
Sergeant William Sarver, the
University of Pittsburgh
ROTC rifle team has develop-
ed into a winning team. Each
of the members — cadets
Taucher, Simodejka, Barrett,
Oblack, Yourick, Laspada and
Pagburn —- practice two hours
each day, five days a week and
their diligence shows.

In the Providence College Rifle
team match on the International
Type Targets. the team won sec-
ond place in the ‘field of 18 school
teams. From among the 90 indi-
viduals competing, John Taucher
won second place and a trophy
(see photo) for shooting a 285 out
of a possible. 300 while Mike Sim-
odejka won a bronze_ metal for his

fifth place score of 278.

In the Senior ROTC and U.S.
Army Reserve Smallbore Rifle
Postal Match. just completed, the
team came in 11th place out of 125
teams competing in the nation-
wide competition. Again John

. Taucher excelled by taking the

bronze medal for coming in tenth
in the country out of the 552 indi-
viduals competing. '

For this rfle postal match the
contestants shot at specified tar-
gets on their home rifle ranges,
and the targets -were then vali-
dated and sent to the national
scoring committee for evaluation.

Future competitions in which
the team will participate include
the ‘First Army Rifle Match, Col-
orado School of Mines Rifle
Match, South Dakota Rifle Match,
and the Nevada State Rifle Match.

This year the’ University of
Pittsburgh ROTC and Varsity
Rifle teams will again. host the In-
ternational‘ Conventional Types
Intercollegiate Championships‘ to
be refereed by William Keister,
an NRA official. Last «year's com-
petition was the third largest in
the United States and, this year’s

‘ should prove tobe still bigger with
25 teams and 100 individuals ex-*

pected to compete. The ‘match,
open to ROTC, women‘s and var-
sity teams as well as individuals.

will be held from 8 p.m. Friday‘ to t

10 p.m. Saturday.

‘THE BROOKLYN

Theatre

> by VIRGINIA JOYCE

The animal fear with its claws
of repression, stagnation and ig-
norance reached into the audience
and grasped the minds and feel-
ings of the victims. The victims
and the oppressors.

, Fourteen young actors. name-
less in their roles. are frighten-
ing and pounding the small audi-
ence of the Theater Upstairs of
the Pittsburgh Playhouse in a
"new environmental ritual.“ Dra-
cula.

There’ are no bloody fangs or
sharpened daggers but only the
darkness of one‘s own heart, the
hopelessness of manipulation by
outside. uncontrolled forces and
fear.j

The ritual, directed by Tom
Thomas and with a script briefly

outlined by him and supplement-.

ed by the cast members, dealt

Director
Rerleems

by ARTHUR ROSENBERG
Drama Critic

There isn’t too much‘ good I can
say about the most recent endeav-
or of the Latin American Theatre
(presented at the Underground
Theatre last week—_end) except
that I’m happy to hear that the
University Theatre had nothing to
do with selecting the p1ays._Their
last endeavor of Stories to be Told
was not superior stuff, but at least

 it was theatre which is a bare min-

imum that last week’s production
did not meet. - ‘

Entitled a Night of Cuban The-.
atre it was composed of two plays
that were experiences compar-
able to being in a strange group of

people and trying to understand
two scant, flimsy and drawn out"

“in—jokes.” . .

Director Bolero should, how-

ever, be commended because -it
appeared (and I prefer to.hope so)
that he did everything he could to
speed them up and fill them with
as much action, visual and_audi-

V tory experiences to keep attention
and interest at a maximum.

Unfortunately, there was noth-
ing within the play itself to serve
the same function. From lights to
make-up there was little polish ,
and, with the exception of super-
ior sound (Jim Mead did a super-
ior job), technical aspects were
rather low on the totem pole. Don-

When Dave Guydan graduates

 .Guydan Reminisces About College

versity, as Chairman of Men’s
Freshman Council (MFC). “The
group soon after abolished it-
self,” Dave explained, “for its
function was obsolete. For those
of its members, it led to other
campus activities."

For Dave, MFC led to the Pub-
licity Director of Student Gov-
ernment (SC) and Men’s Dorm
Council Chairman. In these two
positions, Dave was responsible
for socials and programming.

One of Dave's disappointments
was serving in the SG’ Senate,
which he described as “frustrat-
ing and unrewarding.” “Student
Government is badly in need of
leadership.” the former Senator
affirmed. “Its composition is
poor and highly ineffective. It
left me with such an empty feel-
ing.” V

Dave considers his most re-
warding experience his member-

, ship on the Allocations Com-

mittee. “It entailed the finan-
cing of all campus organiza-
tions. Consequently, I realized
the‘ effect of money and pro-
gramming.“

As Chairman of the Under-
graduate Orientation Committee.
Dave has benefited from that
also, for it too carries tremen-
dous responsibility- "We have
expanded the program so as to
include more informal discus-
sions and presentation of criti-
cal campus issues; Freshmen
have found it worthwhile, and
their responses have been fav-
orable."

Finally, Dave has served as’

President of Omicron Delta Kap-
pa and has been member of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

Dave cited some of the chan-
ges that have taken place since

 

 

his arrival three years ago. One
aspect of improvement is the
academic facilities. “The cur-
riculum is much more advanc-

Paulist characteristic: the abil-

by CHENITS PETTIGREW
Commuter Association Adviser

The majority of students at
the University of Pittsburgh are
commuters. These commuters
share many common problems.
Many have experienced the in-
convenience of early and late
classes and the difficulty of
scheduling classes around their
work schedules. Those who drive
know the inadequacy and ex-
pense of parking in the Oakland
area. Those who rely on public
transportation are confronted
with poor bus scheduling, high
fares, and long waits at the mer-
cy of the elements. The time ele-
ment of commuting often ex-
cludes commuters from many
extracurricular activities. Com-
muters spend much of their day
at the‘University searching for
a place for relaxation and recre-
ation and adequate meals at
reasonable prices. Because com-
muting problems are common to
such a large segment of the stu-

dent body, the Commuter Asso- .

ciation has‘ accepted the chal-
lenge of alleviating these ‘and
several other problems.

Class scheduling has always
been the major problem area_fo_r_
commuters. When a ‘commuter is
left no_alternative but an 8:00
a.m. class he must often leave
home by 6:30 a.m. To a com-
muter a 5:00 p.m. class can
mean a missed dinner since he
may not get home until 7:30
p.m. A large number of com-
muters also hold part-time jobs
and without some co-operation
from the University in schedul-
ing classes, it is very difficult to
plan a work schedule which sat-

'isfies the student and his employ-

er and allows the student access
to the courses he desires. To aid-
the commuter in this problem the
Commuter Association plans dis-
cussions with the Student Re-
cords Office concerning giving
the commuter some priority in
class scheduling. Indications are
that the Student Records Office
is sympathetic to the problem
and is willing to lend assistance
to alleviate it.

Transportation, the most ob-
vious problem for the commut-
er, is becoming increasingly
more difficult -and expensive.

The commuter who drives to
Oakland finds inadequate and
overpriced parking. The city's
effort to enforce parking ordi-
nances is viewed by the com-
muter as near harassment. To
alleviate the parking problem,
the Commuter Association has
acquired use of several Univer-
sity-owned lots which will be
used for low-cost parking. The
Commuter Association is also
working with the City of Pitts-
burgh in an effort to have cer-
tain meter rates, extend parking
time limits, plan new parking
facilities, and consider the crea-
tion of one—way streets to allow
more on the street parking. Very
shortly the Commuter Association
will undertake a parking survey
of the Oakland area to better un-
derstand the parking require-
ments and to put the existing fa-
cilities to better use.

The commuter- who relies on
mass transportation is no better
off than those who drive. Bus
scheduling often does not con-
sider the, need for service in
‘Oakland and frequently disre-
gards the problems of transfer-
ring to other vehicles. The fares
are unreasonably high’ and the
commuter is forced to wait for
long periods of time in all kinds

of weather. The Commuter As-g

sociation is already working with

Most commuters eat one or
two meals a day in Oakland.
The facilities for reasonably
priced meals in Oakland are in-
adequate. The Commuter Asso-
ciation is now negotiating with
SAGA Food -Service for a var-
iety of meal ticket plans which
would enable the commuter to
purchase a meal ticket, good for
a certain time period or num-
ber of meals, at a reduced rate.

To -provide better relaxation

_ and recreation facilities the Com-

muter Association is’ working
with ‘various University. depart-

’muters’ lounge which will open

on the third.floor of the Cathe-

Let's Get It Straight

SCIENCE CAN»-

Science can produce bigger and more destructive bombs,
but it cannot control those who get hold of them.

Science can discover and apply new remedies for physical
and mental illness, but it can not make men stop hurting

each other.

Science can open up limitless doors of exploration and
speculation, projecting the universe out to infinity, but it
cannot comfort the heart of a bereaved mother with any
hope of reunion with her child.

Science can sometimes take
away a young,student’s faith
in God and the Bible, but it
cannot control the reckless‘
course of his life thereafter.

Christians need science and
scientific advancements in or-
der to function in a modern
world, and they do not belittle
its magnificent achievements.
But conversely science needs
the regulatory influence of

V Christianity if it is to function

for the good of all.

N 0 scientific fact is opposed
to God and the Bible, though
scientific speculation may be.
If God made the world and in-
spired the Holy Scriptures, He
certainly knows more about
true science than any mere
mortal. How, then, could true
science conflict with God? If
a conflict occurs, it is because

science has not yet caught up
with God, or because the
scientist has a bias against
God and leaves Him complete-
ly out of his calculations.

God knew from the begin-
ning that man, grown wise in
his own conceits, would de-
part from the truth. “For af-
ter that in the wisdom of God
the world by wisdom knew not
God, it pleased God by the
foolishness of preaching to
save them that believe,” says
the Bible. In other words, the
Gospel of salvation through
the atoning death of Christ on
the cross is self—authenticat-
ing to those who are open-
minded enough, to listen.
Read the Gospels for yourself.
They are the wisdom of God
who made you and all that ex-
ists—including the scientists.

Pitt Graduate Student

In the wake of the current finan-
cial crisis. a graduate student at
the University has thrown his hat
into the political ring for the up-
coming state legislative elec-
tions.

Kenneth Ohler. a doctoral can-
didate and teaching fellow in geo-
graphy, has announced his candi-
dacy for the State Senate in the
30th senatorial district compris-
ed of Somerset, Bedford and parts
of Blair counties.

Currently a borough council-
man in Meyersdale, Pa., candi-
date Ohler has stated: “It’s time
I took more than just a passing in-
terest in Pennsylvania; it’s time
to assume some responsibility.

deplorble sitution which was
exemplified by the obvious lack of
leadership and the irresponsibil-
ity of the present legislators in
Harrisburg.

Running For Senator

Running on the Democratic tick-
et. Ohler is currently unopposed
in the April primary and will chal-
lenge incumbent Stanley G. Stroup
in November's general election.
Stroup is the current Republican
leader in the State Senate.

Married and the father of two
children, Ohler received a BS de-
gree from Indiana University of
Pennsylvania and his master's de-
gree is pending. He was a recent
candidate for recorder of deeds
in Somerset County and as a coun-

cilman he recently initiated a city
planning program for Meyersdale,
a major step forward for the
small, predominantly agriculture
town.

SOPHOMORE GUARD Kent Scott had his finest scoring night of hisivarsity

career last night as his hot hand in the second half led the Panthers to a

92-87 upset over West Virginia. Scott scored 26 of his total 33 points in
the second half, including 12 of the team's first 13 in that ha_|f.

by ED CONLEY
and BILL NAAB

The Panthers and the West Vir-
ginia Mountaineers gave the 6.500
fans who jammed into Mountain-
eer Field House for the struc-
tures final basketball encounter
a game to remember last night.
but most of them would probably
like to forget the outcome. as the
Jungle Cats recorded a 92-87
comeback victory.

The new West Virginia Colese-
um will house Mountaineer games
next season and a playing of “Auld
Lang Syne" was scheduled after
the Field House finale. The Pan-
thers‘ 12th win of the season can-
celled the farewell song.

Buzz Ridl's Panthers also
reached the .500 mark for the first
time this season. and. since the
game was the Panther finale. the
Cats have recorded their first non-
losing mark in six years.

West Virginia’s final record for
1970 is 11-14.

From the outset of the first half
the Mountaineers appeared head-
ed for a victory. They jumped off
to a 5-0 lead and never fell behind
in the half.

Scott’s 32 Points Lead Cagers

THE PITT NEWS

SPORTS  

 

The Panthers began to find the
mark near the end of the first
stanza and cut what was once a 19
point lead down to a 45-36 deficit.

The Cats were a lot hotter when
they came out of the dressing
room for the second half, parti-
cularly Kent Scott. The Cats were

—looking for their leading scorer

and he began to hit the nets.

Scott scored 12 points in less
than three minutes at the begin-
ning of the second half and his
bucket with 17:15 remaining in
the game climaxed a sudden spurt
by the Cats as they tied the Moun-
taineers. 50-50.

The Panthers kept the momen-
tum and Bob Cizmarik put the
Cats ahead. 52-50. with 16:44 left.

Improved Record Makes Sitting

Easier

by BILL NAAB
The back-up men on basket-
ball coach Buzz Ridl’s squad
are similiar to the subs on any‘
other athletic team.

Nobody likes the "fifth wheel
feeling." and each individual be-
lieves that he should be spending
more time participating on the
court than observing the action
from the bench.

Jerry Causer, a 6-5 senior re-
serve, remarked that the attitude
of the players resigned to the
bench is not always a bright-eyed
and bushy—tailed one.

“Things were not too good at

the beginning of the season, but

things have picked-up. Winning
helps unify a team; it lifts the at-
titude of the bench.”

When Causer played with Pitt's
Johnstown campus in his first
two collegiate seasons. he was
selected as the most valuable
playerlof the regional campuses
in Western Pennsylvania. Then.
last year he started at center for
the Panthers.

While he admits disappointment
at being slated for duty on the
bench during the season. he re-
lates a sentiment of understand-
ing.

“It takes something out of you
(sitting on the bench). It always
takes awhile to get warmed-up
and get into the groove of the
game. Yet, I understand the fact
that Coach Ridl feels that he must
give (Paul) O’Gorek experience.”

Mike Caldwell is another player
who is getting used to a wooden
seat at game time. He led the
freshmen squad in scoring two
seasons ago and last year totaled
more points than any other Pan-
ther. -

“I must admit that I was a bit
down at the beginning of the
year." Caldwell stated. “I figured

~ that I proved myself. then I found

myself trying to beat out some-
body else. I realize that I was

Fr Panther Benchmen

probably beaten out by better
players, though.”

Practice at times can be a bor-
ing‘, routine adventure for some-
one who is confined to the bench.

“But, most of the time it’s not
like that. You can’t mess around
too often in practice or else you
never will get a chance," Cald-
well remarked.

Guard Steve Lewis is a promis-
ing sophomore, but has been used
sparingly throughout the year.
Probably one of Lews’ problems
may be a developing phobia con-
cerning crowds.

He had an impressive freshmen
year, but now can’t escape the
feeling that he is a mere speck
in a huge crowd.

“There are just too many
guards," he said. “Everyone is
trying to beat everyone else out
and, we aren’t losing any guards
except for Bob Petrini after this
season." _ '

Do Lewis and the other re-
serves believe that they should be
starting? "Well," Lewis replied,
“everyone thinks he is better than
the next guy.

Cubs °Shoot’ For Win,
But °Fo11l’ Up At W.Va.

Tim Grgurich‘s Cubs took
enough shots to win two games
last night against the West Vir-
ginia freshman: but they didn't
win the one game game they were
playing. _

The Little Mountaineers final
margin was 88-82. '

The Cubs attempted 101 shots
in the game. 21 more than the Lit-
tle Mountaineers. but only hit four
more than the opposition. And the
WVU frosh won. the game at the
foul line. hitting on 18 of 28 at-
tempts compared to the Cubs’ four
successes in 12 tries.

The Mountaineers opened the
game with a 10-0 lead, giving some
indications of a runaway. But af-
ter the scoreboard revealed a 15-
3 WVU advantage, the Cubs swish-
ed 12 straight points to deadlock
the game at 15-15.

The Cubs built up a 45-37 half-
time lead but the Little Mountain-
eers evened the score at 54-54
with 15:33 remaining in the game.

The lead changed hands nine
times in the second half before
WVU went ahead to stay, at 81-80
when Larry Harris connected on
two foul shots with 1:41 left.

Harris was the leading scorer
with 39 points. ‘

Bill Sulkowski led the Cub at-
tack with 29 points. but he only
scored six points in the second half
when points became precious ob-
jects.

Buzzy Harrison and Marv
Abrams each scored 17 points for
the Cubs.

The Cubs leading scorer, Carl
Morris, was in foul trouble

\ CARL MORRIS
Cub Forward‘

throughout the game and saw lim-
ited action. When he was in the
game he only. swished one of sev-
en shots, and scored three points.

With the Cubs shooting only_ 38.6
per cent from the field and the
Little Mountaineers hitting the
nets at a 43.8 clip. there were
many rebounds in the game.

Harris also led both squads in
bounds with 20. Harrison snatch-
ed 29. Sulkowski grabbed 16 and
Cub substitute Randy Arnold re-
trieved 13.

SCOTT MAKES WRITERS’
ALL-DISTRICT TEAM
Kent Scott. the Panther soph-
omore guard who scored 32
points against West Virginia
last night. was the only unani-
mous selection to the Pitts-
burgh Basketball Writers As-
sociation All-District Team.

WVU’s Wil Robinson made
the squad, along with Du-
quesne’s Jarrett Durham, Bill
Zopf and Garry Nelson.

Scott also finished third in

the balloting- for Outstanding
Player. behind Zopf and Dur-

- ham. I
llIltlllllllllllllllllllllllllllIlllllllllllllllIllllllllllllllllllll

 

The Cat lead reached 12 with 9:22
left.

The Mountaineers closed the
gap to two points (83-81 with two
minutes left) with a comeback of
their own, as the Panthers could-
n’t find Scott open and cooled off a
bit. Two key baskets each by Mike
Paul and Paul O’Gorek, however,
in the last» 1:30 secured the win
for the Panthers.

“Any words that you want to
use is the way I feel right now."
Ridl said after the win. "What a
tremendous comeback after be-
ing behind by 19 points! The guys
played a tremendous game.

"That‘s the first time they were
down like that and came back."

The Panthers shot 50.6 per cent
from the field in the victory, and
Scott connected on 15 of 26 at-
tempts, enough to hand West Vir-
ginia’s 38.6 per cent effort from
the field a loss on any night.

One big reason the Cats didn‘t
‘run away from the Mountaineers
was the board play of the West
Virginians. '

JERRY CAUSER
“Best Game”

The Mountaineers out-rebound-
ed the Panthers. 60-40. butmost
of that advantage was gained in
the first half when seven-footer
Mike Heitz manhandled the Cats
under the boards.

Heitz wasn’t much of a factor
in the second half, though, and the
Panthers scored 58 points.

Mike Paul played second-fiddle
to Scott's scoring barage. hitting
for 13 points. Cleveland Edwards
scored 12. and Paul O'Gorek had
11.

Bill Downes also scored seven
points for the Panthers and had
seven assists. And Jerry Causer.
playing his final game as a Pan-
ther. scored seven and grabbed
six rebounds in what Panther pu-
blicity man. Dean Billick. called
"Jerry's best game at Pitt."

The Mountaineer individuals '
didn't have bad nights, either.

Sophomore guard Wil Robison
paced the WVU starters. who all
reached double figures. with 18’

Hospitality

By Martha Hartle

Sports Editor

West Virginia University likes to boast of its big-time -
athletic program, especially in football and basketball.’
But perhaps the Mountaineers should begin treating visit-
zing schools in a “big-time” fashion as well.

' ,It’s no secret that Pitt-West Virginia rivalries in bas-
-ketball bring out the largest crowd of the season in the
Field House. In fact, in the Jan. 14 one-point loss to the
Mountaineers, the Field House recorded its largest bas-
‘ketball crowd of the year.

season and.with the cagers playing theirbest ball since §
1963, a lot of interest was generated for Panther fans to E
‘make the trip to West Virginia. . I

d It was suggested that attempts be made to charter bus-
es to Morgantown for last night’s season finale, yet per-
haps even if buses had been provided there‘ would have
» been no room in the gym for Pitt fans. ’

‘ Late Monday afternoon, this reporter learned that E
gWest Virgina had only 93 tickets available for Panther §
supporters. The Mountaineer gym holds between 6,000-7,-

§ night. And even more absurd than the token number of tick-
Sets available was the price of these tickets. West Virgina —
charged three dollars per ticket for the contest.

§ “Even if we had chartered a bus, it would have been 5
E; too expensive for the students,” explained Athletic Direc-
gator Casimir Myslinski. “With the bus fare and the three
§ dollar ticket price, it was just too much.” ’
-"=_ Myslinski is a great believer in student support for the
athletic program and crowd support can often spell the dif-
ference between win or defeat, especially in the close ones.
Myslinski especially praised the student turnout at Skibog
1 Gym, last Saturday, as the Panther faithful almost equaled E
the home crowd. “The Pitt fans at C-MU were terrific,” 5
praised Myslinski. “They filled half that place.”

But getting back to West Virginia, the problem of Moun-
taineer hospitality goes back to the football season as well.
‘Anyone who attended the grid contes-t on-the famous Mor-
gantown Astro-turf couldn’t help but wonder about the g.
absence of the Pitt band. It was rumored that there was E
simply no space available to accommodate the band.

_The Pitt-West Virginia rivalry has been a long and
heated one and it should continue. But let’s hope_for a lit-
tle more receptivity in the future to visiting fans, bands
and students. Yes, West Virginia, there is a Pitt.

* * * ' * *

With spring football practice only three weeks away,
recruiting for next fall’s freshman team continues to be
going very well. The latest high -school star to sign a letter
.of intent is Bill Englert, a fullback from Upper St. Clair,
‘And according to Casimir Myslinski, several more an-
‘nouncements regarding recruits will be made later this
week, including a blue chip prospect from the Western
Pennsylvania area. ‘

-. p In other football news, Myslinski is still working on
*the_11_th game and the Athletic Department is debating
about which team to schedule.

Who’s Afraid of Giants?

by MIKE MILLER

Most wrestlers would think
‘twice before attempting to fill
the gap left in the mat line—up
by All-America Ralph Cindrich.
but the task doesn't trouble Paul
Allen in the least. ‘

"I don‘t think of it that way." he
says. "I feel that the coach needs
me and I do the best I can."

Allen has not pinned this sea-
son, even when matched with men
who out-weighed him by 50 to 100
pounds. Allen weighs in at 177
pounds and wrestles at 177. 190
and heavyweight. -

Coach Adams has commented
on Allen’s dependability on previ-

-ous occasions, especially when he

was outweighed by opponents.

The big men don’t frighten Al-
len, however. "I’m small and it’s
harder for them to stay on top of
me. They’re not fast.",

Though Paul weighs only 177, he
usually wrestles at 190., This
poses no great problem for him
either. .-

“My_ opponents just have a
weight advantage. They are’a lit-

tle bigger and this slows them

down a bit.” . i
Allen began his wrestling ca-
reer at high school in Long Island.
He later was a section champion
and a WPIAL runner up. He was
beaten by Sullivan from Mount
Lebanon.‘ _ - '
Comparing his performance
this season with other years, he
feels that,he has done better as
far as his record is concerned. He
has attained a 7-5-1 record thus‘
far this year. .A
His toughest match was against
Ben Welch of Navy. Welch weigh-
ed in at 177, the same as Allen.
Both’ men wrestled at 190 pounds.

Casers Grab In(lepen.dentTitle; 

l

— PAUI. ALLEN, the lone seni_or in the mat line-up, has been a dependable

performer for coach Dave Adams all season long. Allen has seen action at

177, I90 and heavyweight this year and here he's in action against one '

. of the East's best, Bob ‘Rush of Syracuse.

Prior to the match with Navy,
Coach Adams thought that the 177
pound class would‘be onevof the

toughest and he put Allen in be— .

cause he could depend on him.

Allen employs no special strat-
egy in his wrestling.  -

Since the freshmen have been
ineligible in the last few matches,
Adams has been -relying on the
heavywieghts to c_arry the major
load.

“I just go out and let it go,” he‘ '
.says. -

Paul says that the freshman
layoff was the down -fall of the
team at Penn State. ‘?It was their.
first ‘match in weeks, they were
inexperienced and it made the dif-
ference.” The grapplers missed

the victory over State by a 17-16 _ 

score. 7
Allen displays a cautious opti-
mism going into the Easterns. "P ‘

.“I hope we can do well," he »

says, ‘*We’ll do the best we can."

Before the Easterns, however, 

the 'matmen have a tough match
with Army this weekend.

Trutkers Tally 3 Wilts --

Analysis by JERRY MYERS

After nine meets, which resulted in only three victories, the
Pitt tankers concluded their 1970 dual meet competition last

Saturday against Kent State.

In acampaign that can be called very disappointing the mermen
failed to pick up the points where they needed them.'Without too much
imagination the team's record could very easily have been 5-4 or even"
6-3. According to the preliminary reports by both Dick Bradshaw and

? Bill Grant the season did call for -

‘a better—than .500 record. The

A clutch victories just didn’t come.

The opening meet of the season.
a battle against Bucknell, Herald-
ed things to come. According to
freshman Alex Braum'feld, “Buck-
nell was really out of shape andwe
should have beat them. Theonly
problem was that we were out of
shape too.”

The two meets that could have
turned the tide in the tankers sea-
son were against West Virginia on
Jan. 21 and at Grove City on Feb.

10. Both of these meets pitted the ’
tankers against opponents equal‘

to their strength. The relays] prov-
ed to be the difference there as
they have all season long. In both

the ‘WVU and Grove City meets‘

the merrnen dropped the medley
relay and the freestyle relay to
seal their fate. I

The Kent State meet followed
the same pattern with the relays
playing a decisive role. It is. in-
teresting to note that in the three
meets that the mermen proved
victorious they did so by captur-
ing either one or both of the relay
races.

This year was a big one for rec-
ords, both on the school level and

- on the pool level. Rick Rowe, in

his first yearas a varsity,swim-
mer, shattered the school. mark
for both the 500 and 1000 yard
freestyle events. ' A

with a time of 2223.2 in the 200‘

Pool records were set in\ the
1000 ‘yard freestyle (Krause. Sy-i
racuse) and the 500’freestyle
(Krause again). Kent State's Les
Moore captured the 200 back-
stroke event and the Kent State
medley relay team set a record in
that event.

pected to lose.to exhibited some
