Letters To The Editor

Equal Trial Privilege
Editor, The Pitt News:

At the beginning of the Spring
Semester, the Pi Sigma Chapter
of Phi Gamma Delta was placed
on _social probation and denied

Carnival by one Ray King. This
action was imposed upon us by
him for supposedly (degrading
the good name of the University
and that of the fraternity system.

We, admit to violating a uni-
versity rule. However," university
rules state that we were to be
tried and punished by the Judi-
cial Committee of SGA and\not
by Mr.- King. After receiving
little satisfaction from the Dean
of Men’s. Office, the  chapter
wrote a letter to this committee
appealing our case and asking.
for a trial. '

This letter has— been in 1 the
Judicial Committee’s hands for.
over a month. No action has
been taken _concerning this ‘letter

_ and at present it. appears as if
none will be taken.

It cannot be denied that last
week the good name _of the
University was degraded by
the acts of other organizations
on this campus. We “feel that

. their acts were much more
serious and degrading‘ than
ours.

However, they received _a trial
and were punished by the Stu-

‘ dent Judicial Committee of
W-hich right we were denied. It
can be noted that the -punish-
ment received by them was far
less than that received by‘ the Pi
"Sigma Chapter of Phi Gamma
Delta.

It seems that: the Dean of A

Men’s Ofﬁce is inconsistent in its
dealings with such matters. We

of Phi Gamma Delta _feel we

have been discriminated against
by the Dean of Men’s Office be-
cause of personal conflicts with
one of its members. . _
We ask for a triallin front of
a Student Committee comparable
to that which other organiza-
tions have received.

Greeks Commended

For Accepting Rule

Editor, The Pitt News:

As a fraternity man, I feel
that -it is necessary "to comment
upon Kent Jarrell’s
concerning the failure to -appeal
by-the three fraternities barred-
from Carnival. .

. First of all, Mr. Jarrell states
that the fraternities should have
appealed to SGA’, and if SGA
would overrule thepdecision the
administration would most likely
ask SGA what alternate penalty
we would impose.’ -

I would suggest that Mr. Jar-’

rell climb down from his ivory ‘

tower’ and realize the bounds
within which SGA operates. Be-
cause the offense was a frater-

. nityresponsibility, the entire af-

fair was handlediby the Inter-

' fraternity Council Judicial Com-
mission, whose decisions, as stip- A

.ulated in the IFC Constitution,
are_appea1able to an Interfra-
ternity Commission: of Appeals,
and not to SGA. ‘

Since the -administration "ac-
cepted the recommendation of the
IF Judicial Commission, it’ is
highly unlikely ‘that they would
"suddenly change their minds,
even if Mr. Jarrell requested it.

Secondly, he berates the fra-
ternities for not appealing‘, and
says he supposes “it’s easier just

remarks -‘

7‘

way out.” J. would wonder if Mr.
Jarrell realizes that the ability
to accept a decision of this kind
‘without cry—baby complaining is
‘the hardest way out, and a sign
of maturity. I '
I think the fraternities in
question should be commended
for their acceptance of the rul-
ing of the Judicial Commission
s and for their never-wavering
loyalty to the IF Council and its
actions. V 9
Mr. Jarrell might be interest-
ed in knowing -that a commit-
tee is being formed to establish
the ‘jurisdiction’ of the‘ various
judicial commissions. I sincerely
hope that Mr. Jarrelloand SGA
can have a judicialﬁcommission
ready. j. , .

Sophomore Condemns
Fraternity Censure
Editor, The Pitt News:
’It was unfortunate that the
three fraternities mentioned in
The Pitt News were barred from
the Carnival Activities. Although
, their punishment was very se-
fully. .A matter such as this
should not be ignored nor on the
other hand should it be exploit-
ed. Mr. Kent Jarrell, president
of S.G.A., has exhibited ex-
tremely bad taste in censuring
these fraternities-for their grace-
ful acceptance of their punish-
ment, in the April 22nd issue of
_the Pitt News. I
It is my hope that this letter
will be brought to’the attention

Attitude For Plan

Generally Favorable

(This is the first in a series of articles concerning the latest develop-
ments in the implementaton of the trimester program at Pitt.)

, By ‘JOANNE DOLINAR

Educational institutions all over
the country are watching Pitt,
some skeptically, many hopeful-
ly. All are waiting to see just how
thetrimester will work once the

In general, the attitude of out-
side institutions seems to be fav-
orable. Last year the “New York
Times” presented a favorable edi-
torial of the subject. Downtown
papers have all come out in sup-
port of the plan. Most feel that

this is the answer to the overflow
crowdof “boom babies” expected
to hit colleges and universities in
the.next few years.

It seems that tri—terms are en-
couraging students to come to Pitt,
rather than discouraging them as
many felt would happen. More
applications from prospective’ stu-.
dents have been received this year
than in previ-ous years. Of course,
it cannot be assumed that this is
due to the implementation of the
trimesters, but it is highly prob-
able that it is.

Coordination tvith High
Schools Sought

‘Presently, the adrninistrationis
working to develop greater co-
ordination with the high schools
in this program. It is felt that a
low number of entrants in-April
will not detract from the program,
since impetus will come from stu-
dents other than entering fresh-
men who plan to go through com-
pletely on triterms.

Since there is now a tendency
toward once a year graduations
in high schools, a plan is now
being worked out whereby stu-
dents with suﬁicient _ credits
will be admitted without gradu-
ating from high school.

At present, this idea is only in
the discussion stage and will have
to be worked out withthe high;
schools.

' No Affect on Status

The University has received ,as-
surance from Harrisburg- that the
-trimester program will not effect
the status of the University. There"
is no speciﬁc number of weeks
thatia student must attend school
at the college level anywhere in

.. the country.

As long as the Middle Atlantic
States Association accredits a
school, a student is accepted any-
where.
