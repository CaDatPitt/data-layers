The “bank then will make or

Chancellor Edward H._ Litch-
ﬁeld is one of the four incorpora-
tors of a new ‘private corpora-

Oakland Research will occupy

The same situation_ applies . to

man said.

However, at ‘ the present time

A Show

The stir that Milton Susrnan started in The Jewish
Chronicle over the choice of the Pittsburgh Athletic As-
sociation for a University alumni dance site is a legiti-

mate one.

The University policy. issued last year states.that
we “will not aﬁiliate with, nor extend recognition to, any
group or association having policies which discriminate
against individuals because of their race, religion, 0

‘ national origin.”

Even though the General Alumni Association is termed
, a voluntary organization with no formal obligation to
"University policy, the connection between the two is
I obvious, and any cries of, “Our decisions are independent
of the University,” fall on deaf ears in the community.
A Director of Alumni Activities Fred Robie admitted
!that the alumni officers had not insisted that the dance
be held at the PAA, but that every other ‘facility in Oak-
land fora dance of this size was booked and he wanted’
to keep the affair close to campus. -

Pragmatically Robie has a point. The PAA may or
»may not choose to discriminate in its membership but
_it is obviously willing to welcome an alumni group of
all races, religions, and national origins.’ The location is
.convenient, and the Alumni Association is not bound

’ by any University policy that prohibits using it. v '

But regardless of, the Alumni Association’s view of
this position and its official independence of it, it might
be a matter of good policy to attempt to follow the
University’s example even if it requires renting a down-
town hotel. It is not an impossible task, and even though
not required legally, it would be a show of faith -in, the
stand its_alma mater has taken. ' I

Marcuse Outlines

Variety of Events ,

By MARTY AMDUR

The Student Union
Board’s spring program as
outlined by chairman Mike
Marcuse ‘offers a great

. variety of activities for the
student body. '

One example of the breadth
of this program is the Midday

Series, topics forwhich range .

from “Pull _Up an Easel” to
“Spy-Warfare Today.”

‘‘Pull Up ’ an Easel” is the

topic of Norman Garbo, an ar- '

tist, who will speak on June
10. Tran Van Dinh, former
charge d’a_ffairs of Vietnam af-
fairs in Washington and now
Saigon ambassador to the
United States, will speak on
June 15.

“With the Vietnamese situa-
tion so .vitally important in
world affairs this program
should be an up to date dis-
cussion of a’ current world
crisis,” Marcuse commented.

Lionel C. Knights, a Shake-
spearean scholar will speak on
June 17. The Midday ~ Series
will conclude on«July.1~5 with
Dan Moore speakingon “Spy
Warfare Today.” Moore was an
OSS counterintelligence "head
in Cairo during World War '11.

Following the noon. lectures
on Wednesdays, the Midday
Series holds luncheons" at 1:00
to honor the guest "speaker.
‘Students or faculty interested
in attending these luncheons
..can leave their names and the
dates of the luncheons in which
they are interested in. preferen-
tial order at the SU desk. .

“The ﬁlm series, too,‘ is a
superb study in many tastes,”
M a r c u s e added. Alexander
Nefsky, ‘a Russian ﬁlm will be
shown on June 13. Three other
films will follow: Make Mine

1-10 record, by losing to

‘Hiram, 8-1, last Tuesday.

Despite the poor season
and a dim outlook for next
year, coach Ben Pope has a

unique outlook of the situation. '

“We’re at rock -bottom,” said,
Pope. “Five members of our

eight man squad are graduat-

ing, and there’s a question about
Sam Donatelli’s eligibility.”
Donatelli, accordingpto Pope,
was clearly the outstanding
player on the team and ‘freally
spilled out his guts to win.”
However, it is not deﬁnite if

cruiting‘.

Bob Bennett of Sewickley~

and Len Modzelewski of Pitts-L
burgh were two of the top ten-
nis players in Pennsylvania.

Pope couldn’t recruit them for ’ A
Pitt, because their grades were,

too low. Instead, .Maryland
grabbed both boys, and this

year Modzelewski was the num'- _’

ber‘ ﬁve man on the team.

_ Despite the poor quality‘ of "V
Panther teams, and the limited

amount of recruiting, Pope is

V not bitter about the scholastic ’
and“ athletic conﬂict. A

are secondary, and that’s the

he has used up his eligibility,
but Pope doubts that he will be
eligible for next season.
_ The netters will, therefore,
only. have captain. Larry
O’Lough1in and sophomore Tom
Barber as returning players.
Because‘ there is no junior var-
sity or freshman team, the ten-
nis team appears doomed for
next year.’ 2
Pope, however, has a solu-
tion to the problem. “It's ob-
vious that we're way down in
the barrel and recruting is
a. major problem because we
-lack courts. Once we get the
courts, we’ll have all the ten-~
nis we want. Until then we’ll
depend primarily on pros-
pects from the student body.

policy states, “The University will not affiliate with nor

It is evident that until Pi
gets its own courts, the ten-_ *
nis team will be drawing on
the studentdbody for its tal- V _
ent. Pope said, “Even after 
we get the tennis courts. it ‘
will take three to four years
to‘ build up a respectable
team. However, I've found
that there’s a lot of hidden
talent among the students.”

BEN POPE
Things Look Bad

Almost anyone will have a
chance according to Pope’s phil-
osophy. “The difference between
players on scholarship at Pitt
and the others, has been neg-
1igib1e,” said Pope. Next year
there will be few players on
scholarship, and‘ if there is a
big turnout from the student
body, Pope. feels, “they will
really battle for a position.”

_ » The_ only scholarship .pros- _
pect Pope has mentioned is
Mike Barr of North Hills.
Besides Pitt's lack of tennis
courts, Pope stressed the aca-
»demic side in relation to re-
-cruiting.« “Many schools take
athletes who fail to meet scho-
lastic qualiﬁcations, but Pitt
has a different philosophy,” said
Pope.

, ';'_director of the Reading Labora-

tory.

The Reading Laboratory spon-
sors two kinds of tutoring ses-
sions individual and small
group sessions. Both are taught

V ' _by graduate assistants trained in

the area. .
‘ .“We work. with about '75 stu-

, ‘dents and we help in all related

areas,” explained Elaine C. Vil-
scek, one of the heads of the pro-
gram. “The students come from
“all grades and we keep them on
the program until they reach their
reading potential.” The reading
potential is determined by test-
ing the student when' he first be-
gins the program.
High School Classes
" - “We also have special develop-
ment reading classes for high
school students who want to
sharpen their reading and study
skills before they enter college,”

-‘ Dr. Cleland added.

Undergraduates who are hav-
ing reading trouble may also,
receive help from the reading
laboratory as well, according to
‘Dr. Cleland. The course for un-
dergraduates is an elective and
it should be recommended by
the student's advisor. '

It is a non-credit course which

-places its emphasis on vocabu-

lary development, study skills,
and speed of comprehension.
There is a ‘fee of $35 for this
course. ‘
“We also sponsor a non-credit
speed reading course for busi-
nessmen, industrial men, and doc-
tors and other professional peo-
ple," Dr. Cleland continued.
iThe Reading Laboratory was
organized at the University in
1940 by Dr. Gerald -A. Yea-
ham. The improvement pro-
' grams started in 1948 when the
University offered Reading and
