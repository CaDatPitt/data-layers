R.A. 3 launch dornt-wide drive

. Students petition Szabo  

by GLENDA MINSHULL

A group of Tower B Resident
Assistants has launched a drive,
to improve Szabo Food Service
via petitions circulated through-
out the dorms. ‘

Although the petitions do not

. vmention specific problems, they

express dissatisfaction with Sza-
bo’s "lack of professional ability
and concern for responsibility."

The petitions, endorsed by Wom-
en‘s Housing Board and Men‘s
Dorm Council, are to be collected
and sent to the district manager

9 and upper level personnel of Szabo,

along with a letter explaining
their views.

Alice Calabria, Senior RA in
Tower B, explained the rationale
that prompted their action, “As

boarding students and RA s, we

get alot of flak." about the food

‘service. After all, students pay

their money and have a right to
expect better than they’re get-
ting.” ' ‘ _ .

To demonstrate their concern
and to spark student involvement,
the RA’s recently sponsored a

Capital lures Whitmans  

. by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

According to Dr.
Whitman, chairman of the Eng-
lish department here, both he and
his wife hope “that people will
come to treat her as a good eco-
nomist and not merely as a wom-
an who happened to land a good
job.”

Since the news of her nomina-
tion to the Council of Economic
Advisors, Marina von Neumann
Whitman, Pitt economics profes-
sor, has been disappointed to find
a mounting interest in the effects
her appointment has had on her
family and how she manages to be
both a woman and an economist
holding a job in the upper echelons
of government.

“Wom_en’s Wear Daily,” Whit-
man stated. "even ran an article
describing the type of hats my
wife wore.” .

While the United States Senate
is organizing to confirm the nom-
ination of Marina Whitman, the
entire Whitman household is or-
ganizing itself for a move from
Shadyside to Washington. Both
professors are taking a leave of
absence from the University.

Although it is not specific or
limited, Whitman expects his
wife’s appointment to continue at
least through the economic re-
port due January 30, 1973. The
duration of their stay in Wash-
ington is dependent on several fac-
tors, one of which is the results
of the 1972 elections.

While his wife is applying her
interpretations of economics to
the Nixon administration, Whit-
man hopes to do research and
work on a book about dramatist
George Bernard Shaw. He is un-
sure whether he will accept a
teaching ‘position.

Whitman described his wife
as being very cognizant of what
her new job will entail.

"In a sense,”-he said. "since she

' has served in the government as a
' membe_r"of-“the Price Commission
 and been involved with the'i,nter-

7‘ _-fr:

   

Robert F. /

 

national branch of the Council of
Economic Advisors, she has mov-
ed up to become her own boss."

Whitman admitted that neither /

he nor his wife was wholly sur-
prised by the Presidents appoint-
ment. He said they were aware
of the vacancy and were also told
that Marina Whitman’s name had
been brought up asya possibility.

“But we were moderately
surprised and not forewarned that
she was actually nominated. We
only became fully aware of it
when Herb Stein, a member of the
Council, called one night and ask-
ed her if she would accept the’

position.”

The Whitmans have tw.o chil-
dren who, said their father, real-
ize the importance’of their moth-
er’s position. Their conception of
what has happened, he said, was

"supplemented by visits to the Exe-

cutive offices while the family
was in Washington during the past
year and a half. -

Neither of the University pro-
fessorsforeseesany difficulty with
the nomination in the Senate. If

the Senate approves the‘nomina- ,

tion, Whitman will replace Dr.
Paul W. McCracken, with whom
she worked closely.

"Bitch -Day" against Szabo.

However, not all of the RA’s
favor the petitioning. Some feel
that since the RA’s are not elected
representatives of the students,
it is not the duty or right of the
RA’s to speak for students on
their floors. Instead, they believe
that elected representatives in
either student government or the
dorm councils should represent
the students and their opinions.

.One RA complained that no vote
of the RA’s had been taken to de-

termine RA support of the action ‘

before the campaign was adopted.

David D. Rothwell, director of
Szabo operations at the Univer-
sity, expressed his concern with
not only the petition movement,
but also every other complaint
that reaches his office.

"Some students have honest and
sincere complaints,” he said.
"They're paying and entitled t
expect improvements.” ‘

He invited any committee that
wanted to review his food pur-
chase ‘orders to do so. “We buy

the best grade of meats,«poultry,
seafoods, produce, and frozen
vegetables,” said Rothwell.

A graduate of the Swiss Hotel
and Restaurant School in Luzerne’,  :'
Rothwell admitted that “where, 
we blundered is where we were 2 " «
trying to satisfy the student.”

He said that several weeks ago “
the Towers Cafeterias featured
fish fried in front of the student‘ .p .
serving line to insure freshness , 
and flavor. Instead, students pre-'*
ferred the liver and onions, also,
on the menu, and a large quantity-
of fish had to be thrown out. Nor-
mally, said Rothwell, liver is left g
over and he is still not sure why,
the fish was rejected.

 

 

However, in emphasizing Sza-_
bo’s desire to meet and, if neces- I.
—sary, surpass the requests of? the  -
students, Rothwell refused to ad-
mit defeat. I

"We want this account so much
that we’ll do anything. We’re not _
giving _up, but we won’t.surrender {  .
food quality or stop trying-—ne'w_   
ideas to please students,” he ‘ill
vowed. ' A _ "Ft-

 

Judge dismisses qPitt , 
' discrimination suit t 

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

A Federal judge has dismissed
a class action suit, filed by a Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh professor,
charging the University with dis-
crimination against women.

According to the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, Federal Judge Her-
bert P. Sorg ruled Monday that
he had no jurisdiction to hear the
case pleaded by Dr. Ina Braden,
assistant professor of Dental Be-

Report calls sports “cost effective’

not be in the best interest ofthe University, and that
a course of this nature might further limit ability

by RON LOZOWSKI

Feature Editor

A white paper on athletics released by the Uni-
versity Athletic Committee argues that the athletic
program is. highly "cost effective."
accounting for over 90 per cent of the support for all
other sports and intramural programs, excluding

administrative costs.

The total athletic program last year cost 1.3
million, generating over $960,000 in receipts. The

football team “made a profit of
over one-lialf million dollars or
almost enough to support all other
sports programs -and intramurals

excluding facilities maintenance," ,

the report states.

According to the report, "Studies
of use of the existing facilities
suggest that they are heavily tax-
ed, if not over-burdened by stu-
dents and faculty." But using civ-
ic facilities instead would require
rentals exceeding current main-
tenance costs, and such a move
"would undermine school spirit
and reduce increasing student at-
tendance.”

The profile argues,
that Pitt athletes “are ’scholars
first and athletes second.

The University currently offers
227 athletic grants budgeted at 2
$466.000. The report concludes.
however, that application of need ,
criteria for. ‘athletic grants would

with football

to attract the "finest scholar athletes possible.”

The study points out that “Pitt athletes havea
higher median grade point average than the Uni-
versity norm, with a QPA of nearly 2.5," claiming
that Pitt’s athletes “clearly rank well above those

from comparable institutions in academic perform-

A number of factors are suggested for fufther

consideration by the Committee,
including “continued development
of the scholar athlete model,”\
recreational outlets for students,
faculty, and staff, and maintain-
ing a program profitable enough
to offset operational costs.

Assistant to the Chancellor Ed-
ward Blakely, secretary for the
Committee, cautioned that the
study should not be construed as
a comprehensive report, but
merely an overview.

Considering athletics a vital ele-
ment of campus‘ atmosphere,
Blakely remarked that he would
view the abolition of the program
as “a tragedy.”

The report underlines Blakely’s
comments, concluding that
"sports and recreation provide a
mechanism that assists in reduc- .

Braden had charged Pitt with
violation of the Civil Rights Act
of 1966 and with enforcing dis-
criminatory practices and poli- .
cies while acting as a stat'e\agency. ' -

Judge Sorg said the CivillRights H ‘. '
Act applies only to discrimination
by race, the Post-Gazettereport-.
ed. He also ruled‘ that the Univer- .
sity is not acting as a state agen- J 
cy in its hiring, promotion, firing, ' '
and salary procedures, ‘despite .
state aid, tax exemption, and in-
corporation.

 

Braden said she will ask for a

tion of the ruling. If that is not act- " A7’!
ed on within 10,days, Braden said .. 1.
she will appeal. A panel of -judges
would then rule whether Judge
Sorg must hear the case. M

Braden was undaunted by Judge D
Sorg’s ruling. ‘ ‘

“I guess I've gotten used to the
idea it's going to be a very long '
and very hard fight,” she said. ,

Charges in the civil suit, filed ‘in’
July, included:

—effecting policies and practices a

of unlawful, systematic exclu- 

sion of and discrimination
against women as a class;

—hiring women at lower rank and
pay than men of similar quali-
fications;

——failure to promote women in the

men of similar qualifications;
and

be phased out if Centrex were in-
stalled. Only the switchboard at
the Computer Center in Blawnox
would remain.

Implementation of Centrex was
suggested by Bell Telephone fol-
lowing a study of the University's
current system.

Dr.
of Purchasing and Central Serv-
ices, said inefficiencies of that
system had prompted the.Uni-
versity to seek improvements,
though not necessarily a new sys-
tem.

“The ship known as our tele-
phone system,” he said, "has

picked up an awful lot of barna— -'

cles . . . and it’s time we scrap-
ed them off, even if we don't go
Centrex.” -

Among the advantages of Cen-
trex, said Nelsonfare overall in-
tegration of the system, direct
dialing, and the facility of add-
ing to the system at any timel

Costs of the new ‘system, how-
ever, might be prohibitive. Should
the University opt for Centrex,
said Nelson, “the equipment_ini-
tially will probably cost the Uni-
versity‘ additional money." -

He pointed out that the current

system is also expensive, costing‘.

William Nelson, Director-

Pitt  might abolish switchloloards

the University “a dollar per cal-
endar day per primary phone. "

Nelson said that proper use of
the Centrex system could also
pose a problem if people don‘t
learn the numbers of those they
are calling. He said that should
Centrex be installed, written in-
structions on its use would be cir-
culated and information operators
would be employed to facilitate
the changeover. '

Though Centrex would enable

Pitt to pinpoint the phones from‘

which. unauthorized calls are
made and possibly cut costs there,
Nelson denied that this had spur-
red -the University to study‘ Cen-
trex.

“That’s just an added attrac-
tion,’’‘hesaid. ‘ I \ '

“We?re' trying to determine in
a technical way and in an ad-
ministrative "way what options
the «University has for improving
its phone system,” Nelson added. _

Nelson said he will shortly sub-
mit hismecommendation on Cen-
trex along with a cost analysis to

-Vice Chancellor of Operations

Joseph Dutton. He would not
predict when a final decision
would bereached.

 NEWS—I?'rid_ay, February 4, 1972

 

 

0 by ROBERT BYER

 Last Friday evening at the White House
a'30-year--old singer, Carol Feraci, per-
formed a patriotic act of courage. Her ac-
tions were so_ heroic that I feel in all sin-
gerity that she should be awarded the na-
t'_ion’,s highest civilian medal.

 _Feraci, while performing with the Ray
Conniff Singers at a White House dinner,

 displayed a banner which read “Stop the
' I_{illing.” She then said, “President Nixon,

‘stop bombing human beings, animals and
vegetation. You go to church on Sunday

igand pray to Jesus Christ. If Jesus Christ
if‘-weretin this room tonight, you would not

drop another bomb.”

. .«These words were very simple and her
message clearly stated; nothing profound
was involved here. Yet these words need to
be said right to the faces of those who are
continuing wanton slaughter and destruc-
tion—including the murder of over 40,000
American men, not to mention the wound-
‘ ing, maiming and total disabling of tens of
3‘ thousands of others—in Southeast Asia.

The reaction to Feraci’s courageous act

 iiwasg predictable. A friend of the President
" shouted, “Throw her out!” and the cry was

 

taken up by others. The scene on televi-

__sion was shocking-—kind of like a Roman
; circus. _

_ A-nd Ray Conniff showed his true spine-

._less. self——he asked Feraci to leave, then
‘apologized, saying, “I guess she doesn't
»,listen to your speeches . .

    

. she doesn't

 

was bought. This was done in or-

know what’s going on.”

The sad truth is that Feraci was the
only one there who really does know
“what’s going on," or at least she was the
only one with enough courage to speak out
and show it.

Martha Mitchell stated, “. . . she ought
to be torn limb from limb.” This was an ex-
pected remark from a “lady” whose type
is nothing new to this ear,th—-they were
seen long ago applauding and loudly cheer-
ing at the amphitheatre as the emperor
turned his thumb down and a gladiator’s
throat was sliced open, or as a pack of lions
tore the guts out of a screaming, defense-
less slave.

 

Mrs. Mitchell, Mr. Nixon. and the en-
tire entourage have demonstrated time and
time again that they have little or no re-
spect for human.life, with the exception of
maybe their own.

Of course, Billy Graham was there to
say that Feraci’s remarks were “very
rude, very out of place."

Well, I ask what better place could there
have been? I am not a Christian, but Iknow

that Graham, who supports the President's ‘
"war policies, certainly isn’t a Christian

gSzabo buying practices lambastedi

either.

Yes, there was quite a reaction to Fera-
ci, who, when all was said and done. grace-
fully left her place, ‘only to be confronted
by President Nixon's Secret Police. What
ever happened to freedom of speech, a
protection embodied in the First Amend-
ment to the Constitution and regarded as
so important that the Constitution would
not have been ratified without its pro-
mise?

Of all places. it should be respected in
the White House when a citizen wishes to
present her feelings to the President. But
as our President and his government dem-
onstrated most vividly in the Pentagon
Papers, they will pretend that the First
Amendment doesn’t exist, as long as citi-
zens let them get away with it.

Martha Mitchell would go so far as to
make the exercise of First Amendment
freedoms, to disagree with her on any is-
sue, an offense punishable by a slow, pain-
ful, bloody death. This is the wife of the
cabinet officer charged with the enforce-
ment of Constitutional protections!

 

I only wish that everyone who appears
at the White House would have the courage
of his convictions to follow in Feraci’s
footsteps.

A quotation from the late Justice Rob-
ert Jackson is called to mind here: "Strug-
gles to coerce uniformity of sentiment in
support of some end thought essential to
their time and country have been waged
by many good as well as by many evil men.
. . . As first the moderate methods to attain
unity have failed, those bent on its accom-
plishment must resort to an ever increas-
ing severity.

“As government pressure toward unity
becomes greater, so strife becomes more

. bitter as to whoseunity it shall be. .

So instead of praise for Feraci as a true .

patriot, we hear charges that she was
»"rude . . . out of place" or that she “em-
barrassed the President."

Well, I see "nothing wrong with embar-
rassing the,President in public, especial-
ly this President, when nothing else seems
to work.

 

Those who begin coercive ‘elimination of
dissent soon find themselves exterminat-
ing dissenters. Compulsory unification of
opinion. achieves only the unanimity of the
graveyard.

“If there IS any fixed star in our consti-
tutional constellation, it is that no official,
high or petty, can prescribe what shall be
orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion
or other matters of opinion, or to force
citizens to confess by word or act their
faith therein.” (West Virginia State Board
of Education v. Barnette, 1943.)

Feraci said in closing, “God bless the
Berrigans and Dr. Ellsberg.” Well, I say

God bless them, and God bless Carol-

Feraci.

 

RA stipend questioned

The cooks are no longer i
charge of the amounts of food t

duced to nothing more than thir
rate kitchen helpers. It ‘is th
managers of Szabo foods that con
trol all kitchen functions and i
is to them that the blame shoul
fall. -

In the past, students have act-ed
to put an end to poor food service
I‘m quite sure the present situa
tion warrants such action again
It is up to the student body of thi
University to demand that _th

agers of Szabo foodsrealize thei‘
full‘ commitment to the student
and -take steps towards this com
mitment or be forced into con
tract cancellation. '

Name Withheld
Upon Request

f¥»§ditor:

_  The most recent article concern-
.:-,,'.ing the inability of Szabo Foods to
 cope with the student food prob-
 lem centered its attention on its
 :_“u,nskilled employees,” par-
ticularly its cooks. However, this
 blatant attempt to set up a scape-
‘_‘ goat for their shoddy managerial
 .. attempts will not go unanswered.
  ‘According to the article, the
 reasons given for the tremen-
 dous delay in the serving of stu-
" dent dinners was absenteeism by
iv A. the employees, which supposedly
 left only unskilled labor to carry
 out the task of preparing the meal.

, This, however, was far from the
 case. The truth of the matter was —
“that there was absolutely no ab-
 senteeism by kitchen employees.
 In fact, they were operating un-
 der full staff.

, What did occurwas the fact that
 only a small percentage of food

   
  
  
  
      
   
  
  
   
  
  
    
   
  
   
  
   
    
     
  
   
  
  

der to cut expenses. The tremen-
dous problem of an insufficient
food supply was then compounded
by the fact that the ,cooks were
ordered to delay preparation ‘of
the remainder of the meal.

The reason given for this was
so that just enough food could be
prepared, thus cutting the cost of
leftovers.

Editor:

We are concerned about the revision in the Housing Office policy
regarding resident assistants (RA) stipends. Supposedly, the reduced
number of RA’s will allow Housing to sign 35-50 new student contracts
at approximately $1,200 each, -roughly a $50,000 increase "in revenues,
We realize that the RAS will assume additional responsibilities, how-
ever, we fail to believe that such duties merit an additional stipend of
$200 per year. If Housing desires to benefit the students, then why not
consider a reduction in housing costs or improvement of existing serv-
ices such as laundry facilities, maintenance, and housekeeping? Or bet-
ter yet, why not further reduce the number of RAs'?RA§ are expendable.

If Housing insists on RA stipends with student funds then the stu-
dents should not only have access to the Housing Budget, but have a
say in how their money is spend. A

Please tell us why the Housing Office needs to provide anradditional
incentive when their office is deluged annually with applicants‘. '

Would the Housing Office give us a detailed report of where our
money goes and why? ‘ ~

In the final analysis, the day in
question was not and has not been
the exception Jbut rather the rule.
Time and time again, inexperi- .
enced managers have not only or-
dered an inadequate supply of food
but have also ordered what could
very easily be termed substan-
dard foods.

Unfortunately, the blame for
these deeds has continually been
aimed at both the cooks and the
cook’s helpers. This is definitely
not the case

Professor Lee is obviously not the only

the worst example. But the combination of
his reactionary and racist viewpoints, the.
fact that he taught courses at Pitt, the fact
that his views are printed in the Pittsburgh
Press and just recently in the Pitt News
while an article opposing racism was for
the most part rejected—demands a deci-

racism, the Pitt News appears silent with

to Kent State and to Attica, it’s easy to see
the effect racism has in splitting students
from militant minority workers.

That brings us back to the Pitt News.
The Friday, Jan. 28, issue had a feature
interview with the “happy warrior.“ Eng-
lish Professor Lawrence Lee.

Professor Lee, for those of you don‘t al-
ready know, is notorious for his pro Nixon.
pro'war and racist viewpoints which he ex-
pounds every Sunday in the Pittsburgh
Press on the editorial page.

,- Interesting enough, an article submitted
by SDS on university racism, and advertis-
ingthe forum we had-‘Monday, Jan. 24, was

virtually ignored by the Pitt'News with.

Here are some racist gems from Pro-
fessor Lawrence Lee, courtesy of the Pitt
News: “It does not follow that the degrad-
ing of values of higher education will aid
anyone. It will only deprive intellectually
equipped students of their expanded poten-
tial” and “It is easier to bring men up to
educational values than to bring an institu-
tion down to ill-equipped men. It is entirely
possible to initiate the education of Amer-
ican Indian, black men and any others into
community colleges where they show even
minimal capabilities.”

_Lee’s statement which implies that min-.
ority people are .“ill-equipped” and show

‘ininimal capabilities” is racist. -In fact,
most minority "students see right through '_

. - "-’

While unemployment, welfare cutbacks,
and deteriorating conditions become a fact
of life for millions of minority and poor
white workers in this country, while-the un-
believably brutal conditions in the pris-
ons remain—and while thousands of min-
ority workers are rebelling against their
opression, we cannot permit a professor
who publically pushes racist ideas to go
unchallenged.

Dear Sirs:
At the evening meal of Sunday,

“I Jan. 30. 1972, I sat down to par-

from studying all day long, I eyed
my plateful of beef stroganoff
with ravenous anticipation.

that he, unfortunately. had ex-

pod, when I wondered if I had been
the only one thus blessed

Bearing my plate and its deceas-
ed occupant, I went to see the
manager back in. the kitchen, to
inquire if he had ever seen this
insect before. However, he was
not in his office and I ‘could not
see him anywhere out on the floor.

I considered confronting one of
the student managers in the cafe-
teria, ‘but I felt that this was a
more serious matter than a “sor-
ry about that” would take care of.

Therefore, I am writing this let-
ter. I can understand having glass
in the mashed potatoes, and even
hair in the salad and corn, but ful-
ly cooked bugs? I

This incident has raised some

Szabo’s pots and pans in the mid-

come from Szabo’s immaculate

to have our board money spent to

Although this letter is ‘writ.-
ten in a light-hearted manner. the
above incident is true, and most
probably not ‘an isolated occur-

bo food is of such consistent low
quality, but must we also put up

“Although F&M is probably not as tough as
Penn State or Navy,” explained Slutzky, “we will
have to wrestle as well as we did against Temple
to win. Remember, we are missing four regulars.”

Randy Payne, still hampered by the flu, will

yield his 126 pound slot to freshman Art Nakazota.
Veteran 134 pounder Gary McClure will continue

filling in for injured co-captain Dave Wylie.

Withthe Panthers entering" the

‘final third of their season tomor-

row night, Coach Buzz Ridl hints
that he ,may try new combina-
tions. to bring the team out of
its three game losing streak.

Ridl may get ample opportun-
ity to experiment as the Cats, 8-8
oppose the William and ‘Mary
Indians in Williamsburg, Vir-

V ginia in an 8 p.m. contest.

The Indians enter the game
with a 5-11 record. In their last
two outings, they lost to Virginia
Tech by 22 points, and dropped

Tomorrow night's game between
Pitt and William and Mary will be
broadcast live and in color. The game
will begin at 8 p.m. and will be car-
ried by WTAE-TV, Channel 4.

Ed ' Conway, sports director of the
station, will do the play-by-play.

Three gridders

picked by pros

Three more Panther senior grid stars were drafted in Wednes- V
day’s professionaldraft. Joe Carroll, Joel Klimek, and Hank Alford
joined Tuesday’s draftees of Bob Kuziel and Ralph Cindrich as can-

didates for next year’s pro ranks.

Carroll, a 6-1, 225 pound linebacker was selected by the Oak-_

land Raiders in the eleventh round. He played outside linebacker for
the Panthers for two years, and joined with Cindrich in Pitt’s twin

linebacker system in 1971.

a 65-53 decision to Cincinnati.

'‘I’m playing around with the
idea of changing the lineup,” ad-
mitted Ridl ‘before Wednesday’s

practice. “But I won’t do it un- ,
~A less it’s the best lineup out there

—— I won’t change it just for the
sake of putting someone new'in.’-’

. Though Ridl hasn’t personally
scouted the Indians, he knows
that they basically’ rely on six
men-five of their men average in
double.figures. '

Top scorer for the Indians is
6-6 Jeff Trammell with a 16.16
average. W&M’s biggest man is
6-7 Jim Warns. -

Ridl hopes that the team can
become more aggressive down
the stretch. “We haven’t been
quite as aggressive in the past
couple of games as we were in

Gymnasts, trackmen

gface tough road foes

Scoring 151.75 for a gymnastics meet may be a team‘s dream,
but to score that high and lose the meet by nine points is the night-
mare Massachusetts went through when it lost to Penn State two

weeks ago.

The Pitt gymmen fly to Massachusetts tomorrow to meet the

same tough club minusall.--around
man Chris Gardner and side
horse man Joe Gracik. Both are
still out with wrist injuries. ‘
Massachusetts is in third place
in the EIGL after losingto Penn
State two weeks ago, but “Don’t
expect them to lose too many
more meets this season consider-
ing they are averaging "over 150
points per meet,” said Pitt coach

V Warren Neiger.
__ 5 Dick Pribis and Mark Boyett

are bothincreasing the level of
difficulty on their floor exercise

" «routines. This will be achieved
_' by adding an extra C move, and
the full twister, either .to the be-

ginning or end of their respec-
tive routines. ’

Bob Rogers added an extra

_trick to his side horse routine as
did Elliot Sanft on his parallel"

bar,last meet against Temple with
Sanft registering his highest mark
ever on the bar. ,

’_ According to assistant coach Ig
Perez, “Our best chances in Sat-
urday’s meet will be for individ-
ual titles in either vaulting, floor
exercise, or side‘ horse. Pribis

will be our top man on floor ex- ‘

ercise‘ and vaulting, while Lee
Lilly will be the side horse man

yivith the best shot at scoring a

first.”

‘Massachusetts is led by. all-
around man Tony Vacca who
scored 49.90 in a recent meet
against Southern Connecticut.
Vacca is an excellent performer
in all six events and is expected
to be a medalist at Penn State for

the Easterns.

Another U. of Mass gymnast
highly rated is Jay Thomsen. His
strong event is the long horse
vault. Top Massachusetts man on
the still rings is Jay Aronstein.

Massachusetts previously de-
feated Army and stands 1-1 in
its conference. Pitt’s mark is 0-2
in,EIGL competition.

The Pitt tracksters will hit the
road this weekend as they travel
tothe Cleveland Knights of Col-
umbus Meet to be run tomorrow
at7:30 p.m.

College teams from all over the
nationwill be competing in the
meet “and we expect top‘ notch
competition‘ especially from
schools like Tennessee and Adel-
phi,” related Banner.

Banner has entered his squad
in four events in the meet.

Andre Harrislwill represent Pitt

in the 50-yard hurdles and Dor-

el Watley will participate in the
600-yard run.

Running in the one mile relay
will be Watley, Ted Bobby,

‘Chuck Mozingo, and.Rick Jack-

S011.

Pitt will also be -running the
two mile relay event with Mike
Schurko, John Black, Bob Schur-
ko, and Ken Silay making up the
team.

Two brother combinations will
lead the University of Maryland
swim team against the Pitt mer-

meet with a 9-1 record.

Matt and Brad Glenn are two _

standouts in numerous events for
the strong Maryland squad. Matt,

younger of the two,specializes in.

all freestyle events. So far this
season he has set the Terp var-

1000 yd. freestyle. He has also
swum a 50.0 relay split in the
400 yd. freestyle relay.

against Knights

In last weekend’s “comedy on
ice” the Pitt skaters banged in
20 goals in a mismatch against
PSU of McKeesport. This Sun-
day’s contest should be quite dif-

, ferent when the icers meet the

Pittsburgh Knights at the Alpine
Ice Chalet at 7:30 p.m..v

’ The Knights are a semi-pro-
fessional team that battles ama-
teur teams in the area. Two weeks
ago, the Knights downed the PSU
main campus squad, 8-2. Tomor-
row, Pitt will be in University
Park, Pa., to face PSU.

Tickets for Sunday’s game will

swims in the relay and the 200

The other brother combination
is the Goodners. Both Gary and
Mickey swim in the short sprint
events such as the 50 free, the
100 free, and the 100 yd. legs of
the relay. They have both broken
50 seconds in the 100 from the
standing start. In fact, Gary has
swum a time of 47.8 seconds.

According to the previous times,

it will be an outstanding meet‘

in the form of excellent perform-
ances.

A Pitt’s best hope is in the 200
yd. backstroke in which Ed Ca-
hill is the only healthy Panther
whocan battle the Terrapin’s
