“ Comments Begin
comments, from. the panel. Since
they were unable to guess the
source, moderator _William Swartz-
baugh, dean of students, told the
panel members that it came. from
thewritings of George Santayana.

' Dr. Copeland started the dis-

A ‘philosopher had ' to say about
America was not true in ‘the
general terms in which it was
expressed. “Santayana’s ideas

American thought.”

Cleland, speaking “as an his-
torian,” felt “the" statement is
true in general.” The intellectual

he suggested, to the formation of

Dr.‘ Ulrich pointed out in sup-
port of the negative aspect of the
statement, that “we are greatly
concerned today with the'medio_-

especially‘ in the realm of enter-

Panetta, .agreeing in general
brought up the point’ however,

Chuck Isler, chairman of

SGA.

Turner,-who has been active

in SGA affairs ii‘ the past, at-
tributed his declination to “pet-
ty political disputes_.” He also
said he expects to devote his
time to academic affairs and to
extra -‘curricular, activities
“where a more valuable contri_-
‘butio_n,to the university and the
community can be made.”

Ray Rowney, president of
Men’s Council, stated his conﬁ-
dence in,Turner as a candidate
last week when he said, “The
foundation has been laid by the
ratiﬁcation of. the constitution —
‘all thatis lacking ‘is the man to.
make it work. Who is moreable
than its chief author?” 4

By “its chief author,” .Rowney
was referring to Turner who was
the ‘chairman of the committee
which revised the constitution.

 5 'Most students, perhaps even those involved -in the or--.
 ganization, view student government as.a great big nothing,
:something that never does anything worthwhile.

 

g A handful of students, however, feel differently. They/
',,‘,"believe"a student - government organization has something“
‘_ eoncrete to offer both them,as participants in it andthe
* ‘entire student body as recipients of its actions.

. , It is unfortunate, then, when these latter students
. choose to take no part in student government. It happens

- without fail every year. From all apparent indications, this
year, or this neiit election, will fall. into line. "

._ , Why is it that these “best” people refuse to run for. of-
Q . ﬁce? They claim, mainly, that not enough other people are
_; interested in student government to make it worthwhile
 forlthem (these best students) to give their time.

Ya/|iuab|eService f

By Jim Vaughan

Most of us college students do not ﬁnd our
lives particularly easy ones. We are going through
a" trying period when we are working hard to
learn something and to be qualiﬁed for desired
places in life. We are making an -
investment of effort, time, and

money. ‘ '
The demands that we face are
many. We must learn diiﬁcult
material, develop skills, and per-
' form on examinations. Many of
us also have to “shift” for our-

sions, relating to career, mar-
riage, . military service," and
further education. '

_ At the same’ time, moreover, b
we hav_e“many needs -— the greatest" of which are

.. usually social — that must be satisﬁed to‘ some

degree.‘ . _ A V. —
‘. ,.WhatI. essentially happens when we study is to

/thrust ourselves into a learningvsituation thatpro-s

duces anxiety. The ‘anxiety results from such

matters, as the challenge ofvunderstanding-T the new.

material, the ensuing questions" and problems that
arise in the mind, the tenacious attitudes and be-
liefs that are threatened, and the vocational desire
to‘-perform well. ‘ " 1 . ‘

We withstand this anxiety and continue to
study while taking periodical ‘.‘breaks”‘ in order to
relieve the tension; we ﬁnally conquer the material.

We experience varying__ degrees of tension in

. making’ the life decisions that faceus. ‘They are

pondered, worried about, decided upon, revised,
pondered again, and so forth. Sometimes, we even
"have feelings that we may not succeed in our life

plans. Hardly pleasant. ,

. Social Needs Create -Dilemma ,

The problems which we face in satisfying our

' deep-social needsand making personal adjustments

are often great ones; the unpleasahtness
ate is sometimes quite strong.

Hence, we ﬁnd ourselves in a dilemma. On the‘
» one hand we must satisfy some of , our personal

needs ‘and work out the problems involved; and

on the other, we are driven to fulﬁll academic and ‘

vocational demands which require much work and
seclusion. ' - A .

We reconcile these divergent forces as best we
can. 'But the greater our personal problems, the‘
mofe our school work suffers. Knowledge‘. and
ability and opportunity and money’ are all wasted
when personal problems interfere with school wrk.

The University,‘ realizing that academic success
depends on personal well-being, established what is
called the Student Counseling Center, two and one
half. years ago. A

‘ ~ ‘ The Center provides for Pitt students a service
that is’ directly concerned with their well-being.
It "is organizationally separate’ from the. academic

 

they ‘cre- A

departments and is under the direction of Dr.
Roy’ Heath. ,

Making no charge for‘ its services, Student
Counseling encourages students to take advantage
of the career and personal counseling that it offers.
It gives a kind of counseling which has every ap-
pearance of being of a high calibre.

Differs from Most

Our Student Counseling Center is unlike those
of several other large universities which are little
more than career placement advice. It works with
thewhole person arid guides him toward the self-
solution of his problems.

_ In its ofﬁces on the third floor of Schenl.ey Hall,
skilled counselors talk with students in complete
privacy. , . g ,

There, the student will ﬁnd an -_informal atmos-
phere; he,,himself, decides how often he will see
his counselor. More important, he is accepted,
really accepted. ‘ He can talk. about anything" that
he chooses. "One counselor’s attitude is “If he feels
that it is important enugh to discuss," we feel.tha't
it’s "important enough itotdiscuss with him.” - - '

Whenever a student ﬁndsfthat a ‘personal prob-:..-Jf.- '

lemfis, absorbing too much of his energies, that it
is interfering" with school-» work, A
counselor.’ . -—‘- - j V _  ._

Sometimes the difﬁcultyis ‘not a personal one.
A student -may just need, to talk to someone about

choosing a career or _major. ' Then, too, a counselor‘

‘ will - be‘ of help. ‘
Students Can Tell

truly interested in him, someone who will always i

be there to talk to. It is likely, moreover, that
he will probably be pleased with-the results. I 

Only those students who have usedfthe services-
of the Counseling Center, or the close friends-of
such students, can evaluate the success of coun-
seling. A semblance of the opinions of such’ stu-
dents is recorded below. ~ -

Seven students who intimately know the‘ Cen-
ter were approached at random and asked “What’s
your opinion._of the Universitycounseling ‘Center?”

.They answ'ered:’ A‘ _ - .
V Sr., Eng.——I think it is very_ good; and,I proﬁted
very much from it’?;Pre—Nsg_._;-“I don't. think it

helped me any, because it didn’t change my mindT’__;_j+_,,_ )‘
“Soph., Fr.—-—“I thought they were very, very ‘help-‘r ~."

fur’; Sr.-——“My boypfriend (Chem. Egr.) went over’

there all the ‘time. He liked it very much.

“He told methat Dr. x doesn’t ten you what

you should do. He sort of makes you realize what

4 you want to do”; Grad. Hist.-—-“They’re= all nuts"

over there”; Soph. Eng.-—“It depends on who you , ‘

get. I had Dr. Y and liked him, very much. They.
say that Dr. X is no good”; Soph.——“She Soph. Sci-

ence) says that it helped her to get a better pic-
'ture of herself as she really is. Now she’s very‘ -V

happy and is doing real well in school.”
These remarks need no furtlier discussion.

Pospibility of Passes

Editor, the Pitt-News:

This letter is in reply to the
probkms raised by Emily Kais-

Urges SGA‘to Investigate
Passes”). . H

The colleges and universities
of ,the City of Pittsburgh have,
in the past, petitioned the Pitts-
burgh Railways Co. to look into
some plan whereby our students
would have the opportunity of
acquiring transportation passes.

As you probably know, public
and parochial elementary’ and
secondary school students have
been using this privilege for
years, -. -and, therefore, wefelt it

. should be extended.-,t'o .stu,dents:

Yearly Election
Held Tonight .

The interfraternity Coun-

tions tonight with Jim Gron—
inger and Nick Kefehrunning

IFC will adopt a per capita
system in which each fraternity
will pay in accordance to the
number of its members, rather
than the old system-of a flat rate
‘for all fraternities.

The council will also be pre-

sented with the plans for Greek
Week. If these plans are ac-
cepted the cost will be $3.25 per
fraternity ,man._ I "

IFC will not sponsor any events

ing will ‘continue this week with
each fraternity sponsoring lunch-
es and dinners.

Informal parties will continue
this Friday night. In the past
weeks the individual fraternities
have sponsored tea dances, in-
door hay ‘rides, square dances,
hypnosis parties and Monte Carlo
nights. Saturday evening most
fraternities will hold‘ formal
dances.‘ -— , -

All rushing will end on Sunday

.Rex Peery is still up in the air after last Saturdays’

to Annapolis to meet the Midshipmen of Navy.

Gymiiasts Take
Perfect Record
To Navy Meet

By LARRY HAGGERTY
Having successfully con-
quered Springﬁeld, W e s t
Virginia, and Syracuse to
date, Coach Warren Neiger’s
, surprising Panther gymnasts
journey to Annapolis ‘on
Saturday afternoon to encounter
Navy. The Middies won last year’s
meet at the Field House 52-44. so
-Navy’s 1960 gymnastics team
4 features a mixture of proven stars
and a group of untested newcom
ers. The Midshipmen have-‘downed
West Virginia and Springﬁeld in
their only action of the young
season, but ﬁgure to have their
hands full with the Panthers. 
Tumbler Joe Marshall and par-
allel bar ace Bruce Krueger, a
pair of "outstanding juniors, ﬁgure
to be outstanding this year. With
Marshall, Captain Paul Carwin
and Paul Sparks form an excep-
tionally strong tumbling ‘unit for
Coach Chet Phillip’-s team.
Hulme Holds Record
This season the ‘Midshipmen are
back in the running in the rope

 

climb after an absence of several"

years with Nelson Hulme who set
'a new , Eastern ’ Intercollegiate
Gymnastics League record of 3.2
seconds against West Virginia two
weeks ago at Annapolis. E _

On the parallel bars, Krueger
is backed up by a pair of sopho-
mores Pete Koch and Bill Bow-.
~en, who are beginning to show

_ improvement ‘as the ‘campaign
progresses, ' Navy’s. unknown
quantities are the side «horse,
horizontal or ‘high bar, and ﬂy-
ing rings. , _

Competing on the rings for the

 Middies, who compiled a 4-2 dual

meet record last season, are Larry
Ewert, Van ‘Temple, and either
Dale Pearson or Murray Witcher.
Joining Carwin on the high bar

“are newcomers Gill Perry and
John Maheu.

Trio Performs
The trio of performers on the
side horse are Joe Maiden, Larry
l"iiden, and Jerry ‘Larsen, .all
sophomores. Hu1me’s partners ‘on
the rope include Gary Wheatley
and Harvey Weatherson while Ce-
cil Tune will_join the P-bar ag-
gregation if called on by Coach
Phllips. ' _ ,
Neiger, meanwhile, features a
starting lineup centered around
Co-captains Dave _Hirst and Don,
Kasner. .Kasner will work the
horse, highlbar andparallel bars
while Hirst will see action on
the ﬂying rings, high bar and
tumbling.- I .
Earl McConnell and Joe Battag-

lia round out the tumblers, but.

both gymnasts will see other ac-
tion. iBattaglir. will work‘ rings

Coach Peterson’s line-up has
shown a shuﬁling of his top ten

is nearly as strong as its ﬁrst
and because of this there is
likely to be a constant shifting
of" players between the two

units. .

The ﬁrst team consists of Ben
Jinks, Howdy Dapper, Tom Olof-

Macziizak. On the second unit are
John Larkin, Lou Slaby, Chuck

‘ment implied that performance

xwas more important than ideas,
7 and a st-eech scientistytoday “is
‘concerned with the persuasive
,, power of ideas and not that of
 frhetoric or performance.” ‘

 , On this point Cleland stated

 not “whether movements arise‘

punishes his creatures or has ‘a 

will of the type of which we are
conscious in ourselves. An indi-
vidual who ‘should -survive his
physical death is also beyond‘
my comprehension, nor, ‘do I,
wish it otherwise; such notions
are for the fears or absurd ego-
ism of feeble souls." "

Panetta commented that this
quotation,,which was taken from
the works on Albert Einstein, did
not show evidence of the scien-

— tist’s not believing in God. Mere-

ly that he “couldn’t believe in an
anthromorphic conception of ' a
Divine Being.” '

Reort on Existence .

Copeland retorted that “the in- —

ability to conceive of something
is no reason for denying its exist-
ence.” He illustrated/that he him-'
self was unable to ‘conceive of
“what the computers are or do on
the eighth floor of the Cathedral,
but I do not disbelieve their ex-
istence.” ‘ ‘

He also pointed out that a
“survival of physical death has
been seriously investigated by
such men as Broad and Sidge-
wick, who can certainly not be
said to be motivated by fear‘or
absurd egoism.

“These men,” the philosopher
continued, “do not maintain the
truth of immorality, but feel the
evidence for it‘to be as strong as
that against it.” _

Cleland, however, did not feel
that the last point was not con-
vincing enough. It seemed to him
that “if the evidence for either
side is equally weak, then the
ability to conceive of the idea is a
pretty good criterion." -

Here the time ran out on the
discussion. However, the audience
had been given the opportunity to
see the opinions of men from
varied ﬁelds at work on the same
topics and to enjoy a lively pro-
gram. The rest "of the series shows
possibilities of being as lively.
