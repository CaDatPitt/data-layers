Frigitl rooms get, cold ereccption

Feature Editor

The freeze is still on in University buildings. ac-
cording to aninformal survey of students.

The recent cold snap marked a considerable
decrease in the comfort of classrooms, a number

of students said.

A“I couldn’t take any notes because I was sit-
ting on my hands,“ remarked one irate student.

Dorm students were particularly incensed. One
said her room “was like an icebox; I felt like a pop-

sicle. ’ ’

Another quipped that “icicles were hang-

ing from the ceiling.”

Sunday night the Student "Union was too cold
for comfort, studentsyagreed, particularly in the
halls and on the stairways. In the Pitt News office,

, the heat was not turned on until late that night,
causing some staffers to don caps and jackets.

‘Administration pays Commissioners

SA   heads win  

byMKMAEL$MON

After. nearly eight months of
effort and a near run-in with Pres-
ident Nixon‘s wage price freeze.
the threeoutg/oing Student Asso-
ciation Commissioners are re-
ceiving their «salaries.

The original request was‘l'or-
warded to the Allocations Com-
mittee’ last April. but since its"
policy is not to use student funds
for salaries. the ' Commissioners
had to go elsewhere. _, ’

The $100 per month‘ salaries
were finally approved by the Stu-
dent ‘-Affairs Advisory Com‘-
mittee ,(SAAC) and Chancellor
Posvar in late September, after

These buildings are heated by the Bellefield
Boiler Plant. a non-profit‘agen‘cy which supplies

heat for the University.

The Plant was to'be converted from coal burn-
ing to gas sometime last month.‘ '

“I believe that one b_oiler was converted. I’m

not certain about the other,” stated Physical Plant‘

of an insurance plan to cover
costs of the fees now being paid.

Presidential contender Dennis

"Concilla said that “the reason for

the fee is because the hospitals
said that if we don’t pay, they
won’t accept any more of our stu-
dents. It (the fee) has been ac-
companied by improved services.”

Another source of controversy
was the budget of thegoutgoing
Student Association. which Board
candidate Chuck Steeber labeled
“the big issue."_

Director Hunt Martin. He admitted that the low-
ered temperatures are still being maintained.

Martin also said that the response since the _
lowering of the temperatures in the buildings has
been “very favorable," adding that -the rooms
had/previously been overheated.

The cold spell "should not have had any real! »
effect“ on room temperatures, argued Martin.
since a constant temperature is maintained rather
than a particular balance between outside and in-
side the buildings. - Z

When questioned .regardin-gﬂrthe Student Un-

that someone,had failed to adjust the thermostat.

that finance student government.
presidential hopeful Bill Small
asked: “What's the student body ,
getting?_Students paid 75¢ for a

ie wasn't shown. but rather a $200

Board candidate Al Mateka said
he is seeking office becausehe
wants “to serve students, not one

the original request had been cut
from “$120 per month and provi-
sions for retroactive ‘summer-
time living expenses eliminated.

However, ‘the wage-price’

freeze proved a stumbling block,
when Dr. Otto Nelsonof the Of-
fice of Emergency Preparedness
(OEP) announced that the sala-
ries would be illegal under
Phase "I legislation. ‘

, ‘Added to this was the threat '
posed by students,of the Univer-

sity’s being sued if the payment
requests for the salaries were
signed by the administration and
thereby given authorization.

The request was shelved until‘

Dec. 18, when Chancellor Posvar
recommended that the money
the Commis-
sioners as promised, and’ that
their request should be made ret-
roactive to Nov. 15 to coincide with
the initiation of Phase II and to be
valid until the Commissioner’s
terms in office expire Jan. 31.

Payment for this period of time

Marcus Zolnier. presidential

government is a business, :not a

Moye said, “I would not institute‘ ,
any type of pay schedule for any
campus organization- member bun-"fl .b

against salaries being paid.” ‘V  ‘

Though Lawson 1:efu~se_d' to com-H‘

- Previously, Academié Commis

Though conspicuous in a crisp-

cut, Panneton in his recruiting”...
booth on the ground. floorof the-.-
Cathedral has attracted no d_er,i-ff

Had he visited campus two 01:‘-
three years ago, Panneton would’
have been well advised to come ..
fully armed and prepared for bat- ‘
tle. The military/industrial com?‘
plex was the enemy. ItsROTC
and Dow Chemical f(makers_ of:

the kids from the safety of theirc}
ivory tower, when the kids sud-
denly began swearing and‘ throw“-

beat a hasty_retreat to the smaller};
schools where they would sti_ll be 
welcome. ’  I

When Panneton came to Pitt as '

. In an “ effort to expand_ the
.f'ledgli_ng Black Studies program
§;_at~the University, the University’
Center for International Studies
is sponsoring a series of seven‘
lectures entitled “The Black
Man _In the Caribbean. ” '

T Each lecture _consists’ of a
talk on some aspect of Carib-
bean life by a noted authority,
"followed by a period for ques-
tions from the audience. There
is no admission charge.

5 Mainly, the series explores
the economic development of
the Caribbean, focusing on the
English-speaking segment of the
population. Other ethnic groups
will be examined in less detail.

a ‘of the program, stated that the
study of the Caribbean’s econo-
“mic system is not an end in it-
self. A .
?ju“We hope this study will
branch out to incorporate other
{areas of development, such as
social and cultural areas," he
explained.

with an outlook to the future.

V‘-‘Most importantly, the lee,-
ture pointed out how models of
industrialization employed by
governments are ‘directly pro-

A second lecture, to be deliver-
ed January 26 by Doctor Gor-
don Rohlehr of the English de-
partment of the‘ University of the
West Indies, is entitled “The

-Changing World of the Calyp-

sonian.”

“This lecture,” Blackett said,

-_"will attempt to look at the

Calypsonian as a significant
social commentator in the area
and explore the ways in which
he has had to adapt himself to
the changing economic situa-
tion.” « ' 
Blackett also pointed out that
this series is an important step

in the development of Black‘

Studies at the University.

“This program was designed
to develop as an integral com-
ponent of the Black Studies

‘department and as a useful area

of study in the Center for In-
ternational Studies,” he said.
"Any initial success will stimu-
late and assist in the develop-
ment of the program.” ,

In this respect, said Black-
ett, the response to the first
lecture was encouraging.

“This program sets out to ‘in-
vestigate development in an area
which , should be of singular
interest to Americans both as
a study in and of itself, and as
an investigation into how other
peoples tackle and try to re-
solve their inter-group con-
flicts,” he said.
relative success of the first lec-
ture attests to the wide inter-
est in Caribbean studies at the
University, both at the student
and faculty level.”

Welfrtre stops paring
students from rolls

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

The Allegheny County Welfare Department, reacting in part to

pressureifrom the Welfare Rights Organization, has agreed to stop

taking students off welfare 1' rolls until the issue is resolved in.

Harrisburg.

Previously the County had been paring students from the wel-

fare rolls, in accordance with a letter sent from Harrisburg to can-
didates whose status was under question. Under public assistance
rules, the letter said, a recipient of aid is required to make himself
available for the maximum amount of work he is able to do. S

According to David Secor, a spokesrman for the Allegheny’

County Board of Assistance, the State Legislature basesits opinion
on the fact that college students, since they are not available for
t'ull-time employment, are ineligible for cash assistance.

“There is a feeling on the part of the State Legislature that
perhaps recipients in Pennsylvania ‘should get out and work rather
than better themselves through education. It makes no sense to
me,” Secor said.

Secor stated that the Executive Director of the County Wel-

fare Department has agreed to not vigorously enforce the direct-
ive until further clarification comes from Harrisburg.

Secor said thatithis action was not retroactive—students al-

ready cut off were not being reinstated. In addition, the depart-

ment is not accepting new applications from those who qualify un-

der this classification.

Bob Loranger, a member of

the Welfare Rights Organization

of Allegheny County (WRO), ‘said that the directive from. Harris-
burg was not a law and that its enforcement was being individu-
ally carried out by the executive directors of each Pennsylvania
county. . '

The Welfare Rights Organization is fighting the new interpre-

tation on the grounds that a college student cannot become self- .

sufficient if denied a chance for an education. The changes, Lor-
anger stated, are not only menacing the future of the poor college
student but are also harmful to the state in the long-run.

Students affected by these regulations or interested in influ-

encing policy making should direct any questions to Bob or Steve
of the Welfare Rights Organization at 471-0180.

Secor added that an open board meeting of the County Board
of Assistance is scheduled for 7 p.m. Thursday, January 27 at the

City-County Building.

“We want to push the state
and plants intointelligent long-
range thinking about the abate-,
ment of river pollution,” said

David Marshall, voluntary coor- —

dinator of Environment Pitts-
burgh. K
The auburn-haired English-

man described the Mon river
as "tarry, dirty, dreary, smelly
and altogether disgusting.”

And, David Marshall should
know, because he’s made 18
trips down the river, crawled out
of privately-enlisted motorboats,
and climbed sludge-covered hill-

sides to personally collect the .

outflow from industrial pipes.

“They out and out iust don’t
care,” Marshall exclaimed as he
listed the chemicals like phenol,
cyanide, ammonia and naptha
that are mixed in the 200million
gallons of waste that pour from
each drainage pipe daily.

“The technology to handle

this waste is known,” Marshall‘

insisted “It’s a matter of mak-

ing them install the equip-
ment. ”
And with some help -from

state and federal agencies, the
150 or so members of Environ-
ment Pittsburgh may reverse the
stagnation of the -Monongahela
River. The State Department
of Environmental Resources is

' collecting the laboratory data

that Marshall and his volun-
teers have amassed, data that
can be used in Federal courts
in accord with the
Streams Act.
Environment Pittsburgh has
applied to the state for funding
and according to Marshall "the

Clean- ’

state has already said that it '

intends to fund‘ us in the area
of $21,000.” '
Volunteers, however, must do
the groundwork for finding the
polluters along the Mon, be-
cause “the state just ,doesn’t
have the manpower,” Marshall

said. _ S

Education Cabinet 
needs new support

by JERRY WEBSTER

Among undergraduates in the School of Education there pre-
vails a feeling of helplessness and inability to control the course of
one’s own future.

Undergraduate advising is poor and personal contact between
faculty and students is minimal. Now that certification is exclu-
sively in the hands of theUniversity, it seems as if the students whole

life has been put in the balance—and the balance is controlled by ‘

some erratic and impersonal force far beyond the influence of any
human, nonetheless a second rate citizen like a student.

This feeling of helplessness is undoubtedly a result of poor.
communication. In reality, no student has more power to influence
the course of his education and the course of the school in which he
is enrolled than does the student in Education.

The Dean of the School, Paul Masoner, has been interested in
directly involving students in the governing of the School.

In the University as a whole, that interest has been. confined to
advisory committees, which are usually frustrated bodies, that do

nothing.

In the School of Education, graduate and undergraduate stud-
ents have voting seats on the'Faculty Council, the Administrative
Council, the Academic Policy Committee, the SchoolResources Com-
mittee, and will sit on the Appeals Committee once it is formed. '

In the Faculty Council and the standing committees, graduate
and undergraduates control a quarter of the votes.

The Undergraduate Cabinet in the ‘School of Education is the
single undergraduate political organ in the School. Just recently, I

replaced Chris Ryckman, as Cabinet Chairman. I've found that the

single reason for so few active students in the cabinet is simply lack

' of communication.

At this time, it is especially crucial that students get involved.
This is the first -year that -faculty and students have been given an
active role in governing the School of Education. Since Dean Mas-
oner isretiring next Fall, it is essential that we set a precedent of
active and outspoken student participation in School of Education
government, so that the power given us by the present Dean cannot
be usurped. ’ 5

The cabinet is not only interested in affecting the course of the
School of Education, but it is also deeply committed to affecting
the course of publiceducation in Pittsburgh.

Last year, the cabinet staged itsfirst Encounter in Education.
with John Holt and Charles Silberman as speakers. The Encount-
er included films, seminars, lectures, and demonstration classrooms.

It brought together many people who share the belief that‘ it is
time for our schools to change—and coming together gave those peo-
ple the confidence to bring about that chance. _ ‘

Our second conference is scheduled for March 3, 4 and 5. and
entitled Encounter in Education Two/Action and Involvement. We

hope to greatly expand on last year’s_program'and include work-‘

shops and extensive materials displays.
Neil Postman, author of Teaching as a Subversive Activity, and

Vito Perrone, director of the New School of Behavioral Studies in ,

North Dakota are scheduled. speakers. V

Students interested in seeking -to participate in the conference
are encouraged to visit at the Undergraduate Cabinet’s office. 2727

Editor: A

In response to the article “Sen-
atorial Scholarships: an Expen-
sive Custom”, I would agree that
a more equitable system of award-
ing scholarship money is needed.

I would suggest that before’

abolishing the Senatorial Schol-
arship System, one should in-
vestigate the criteria for deter-
mining scholarship and loan
awards used by other agencies,
such as PHEAA.

If it had not been for a Sena-
torial Scholarship (Sen. Thomas
Lamb,) college would have been
out of the question for me. The
award was not a “political plum”
but was based on need.

Senator Lamb's concern in.
awarding scholarships was to
help the needy students. of his
district, the North Side of Pitts-

burgh. At -one point, he divided _
his scholarships" into 1/4 tuition be- "

cause more low-income students
of his district wanted to go to
college. _ .

Granted, he may bean excep-
tion, but I am speakingfrom
personal experience. But I also
know that it is not uncommon
for “needy" students who apply
to. PHEAA to falsify information
they file for application.

Scholarship ‘criteria questioned 

After applying for a PHEAA
loan in my last year of under-
graduate studies, I received about
half of what I requested. I was
told by an aid official that I was
too honest, that my financial
status was bad, but I should have
exaggerated and made the situa-
tion look worse than what it was.

, That is rule No. 1 in filling out
a financial aid application!

How do those students, who re-
ceive such aid. use it? Under-
graduates brag about how they
got their car down payments. en-
gagement rings, and investments.
Loan money, for example, would
be invested or deposited over a

- four»year period: the loan is

paid back before 9 months after
graduation, interest free'—the in-
vestor collects interest accumu-
lated in the past four years. Such
practices do happen, why?

One should think again before
suggesting that money be award-
ed “possibly on merit as well.”
What does merit have to do with

arm Mamie dull!

."Sunday’probes lo   e’s limitations

by POHLA SMITH ~
News Editor

The tangled mass of wires of a
telephone answering service is
symbol of the confusion in the
lives of a love triangle which it
serves. 1

Sunday, Bloody Sunday is the
second attempt by director John
Schlesinger of Midnight Cowboy
fame to show the less attractive
facts of life as he explores the
many opportunities and limita-
tions of love.

Dr. Daniel Hirsch (Peter Finch)
and Alex (Glenda Jackson) dis-
play the amazing adaptibility of
humans. Both are aware of the
other’s existence in artist Elkin’s
life, though, they somewhat re-
signedly, and occasionally bilious-
ly, accept it. Some love is better
than no love.

Most likely the film will not
score as another directorial tri-
umph for the Oscar-winning
Schlesinger. Though entertaining,
the film is not gripping or memor-
able; in fact it borders on dull-
ness.

Mentors shift, priorities

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD

The Mentor program is shifting
priorities next year to provide
freshmen with a more rounded
picture of the University.

Previously socially oriented,
the program will branch out this
year as an informational and lis-
tening body.

Terre Amblint, student direc-
tor of the Mentor Program, said
the new group-“is not the mentor
program as such anymore—it will
be an on-going orientation ‘pro-
gram throughout the year.”

As counselors to students, Amb-
lin said, mentors will probably un-
dergo a more intensive training
program this year.

_A number of programs still in
the planning stages — including
seminars and a possible course
offering--will provide mentors
with experience to handle their
added responsibilities.

More faculty involvement will
be instituted directly th r 0 u gh
these new areas of training.

Although the mentor program
is changing to include other infor-
mational areas, Amblin said, “It
is still concerned with socially ac-

Direction and photography are
conventionally narrative. A few
flashbacks and recurring sym-
bols, like the telephone wires. are
only special tools the film—mak-
er uses. But his low-key approach
is what makes the film good, for
above all, it is believable.

Finch is a realistic homosexual.
The aging Jewish physician is not

portrayed as the stereotyped, leg-_

crossing queen, but a gentle, lik-
able, lover of art and classical
music who happened to find his
love among fellow males.

Jackson again shows the uncan-
ny ability to get inside a charac-
ter’s soul as she did in Women in
Love. She is alternately bitchy,
tearful, passionate, distraught -
changeable as a woman rebound-
ing from a bad marriage to a
worse affair would be.

But Murray Headas the young
heterosexual is lifeless and flat,-
one is left wondering how the hap-
less homo and lonely woman could
have ever found him attractive.
The passions of ‘an artists are
missing, as is thetension and mis-

claimating students.”

“You can’t be oriented in just
three days,”she affirmed, saying
that the overall effectiveness of
the mentor program would be
greatly increased because of its
on-going schedule.

Students interested. in becom-
ing mentors ‘may pick up applica-
tions in 105 SU, and return them

ery that surely must plague a man

torn between two loves.

But unexciting as the film may
be, it is thought-provoking. One
ponders not only the many possi-
bilities of love as he watches two
men tenderly kiss, but also con-
siders the steadfast unsinkability
of humans.

I When the pressured lover runs
off to America yelling, “I’ll be

back-someday,” there are no tear-1
jerking threats of suicide. Instead

with Vonnegut-style fatalism. the
two begin again. Finch plans a trip
to Italy, Jackson quits her job.
Just as messages manage to come
through the tangled telephone
wires, the spirit of survival
emerges victorious from 1ove’s
entanglements. ‘

Julie Christie and Alan Bates decided to

_ Based on a screenplay by Harold Pinter,
the film reflects the life of an extremely

terribly stuffy one indeed. One summer Leo
(Dominic Guard) comes to stay with their
son, adding a slight change to their useless
lives, making up for his lack of money with
a refreshing manner and a penchant for cast-

Leo is the major. character, and it is
obvious that Christie and Bates were head-

-, '‘:‘If' they (Pitt) swim like they did; against Clarion
State, it will be an awfully lopsided meet,” pesimistical-

ly explained West Virginia swimming coach Kevin’Gilson*

as he awaited tonight’s encounter with-the mermen.
‘ "We’ll have to be sky high to keep the meet close."

Last Saturday the Mountaineers weren’t high enough
as -they dropped their season's record to 2-2 with a loss
to_Catholic University, 63-50,’ in Morgantown. ~

Pitt, meanwhile, dropped its meet to Bucknell, 75-38,
; and its season record to 1-1, but will be out to avenge last

  year’s home defeat to the Mountaineers, 57-56.
~. ._ Twelve WVU team records have been set by present

members of the team.’L_eading the way is Bill Kweder, a
senior co-captain from-Erie, Pa., who holds the record in
the 50, 200, and 1,000 yard freestyle events; ’

. So. far this year he has beenspecializingﬂin the "shorter.
-. ‘distan_ce.races,‘being timed in 22.7 seconds for the 50 yard

. ."‘even't against Catholic University and a little over 51 sec-_

- onds in the 100 yard event against the University of Vir-

ginia, a team W_VU defeated, 66-47. k

In t_he‘team’s loss to Bethany and the victory over

_ William and Mary College,.‘diver Dave Holivics, a senior

from'Tonawanda.,N. Y., performed in the same top form

as did Pitt-‘s Dave Wessel one year ago, winning at least

- one of the diving events and in most cases, taking both
‘of them.‘ a . . A

Mountaineer merman Peter Biffel ‘has, been the
. team’s stalwart in the 200—yard individual medley and the
 200’yard butterfly,,posting the squad’s best time of 2:18

and 2:13 in those respective events. ~

At .WVU’s Lair pool,David Pentz and Ed Slominski,
. with times of 11:13 and 12 minutes flat in the 1,000 -free-
style, don’t ‘seem to be an equal match for:-Pitt’s ‘Fred
Lewis-. Lewis is undefeated in the event and 18 seconds

‘ faster than’WVU”s best time of the season." ' - '

One of the mostinteresting races of the ‘meet will pit
Panther merman_ Ken Kirkham-against Geoff Young and

Geor.ge.Curtis inthe 200 yard breaststroke. They all have "

 almostidentical times. 4
The, Mountaineers’ claim that ltonight’s competition

will be an’ “anticipated meet of tough competition, giving
Coach Kevin Gilson’s squad a cha-nce to improve onlast’
f‘season’s final mark of 7-2.’’' ‘ é . _. '
But, with ;the likesof Bernie Victor,‘who_ in the Buck-

ne_ll meet set a new team record’ in the 200 -yardindividual

_ medley of 2 :07+, and Rick Rowe, who defeated All-Amer-

'  ‘ican Peter O’Keeffe in the ‘500 yard freestyle and surpris-
_ :in‘g' Mark Cohen in the 100 yard freestyle, Pitt has the op-
 , portunity to bounce back fromddefeat and improve on this

 'year’s 1-1 slate.

All-around performers Lenny Hlasnick,‘ Roland:Zéidlejr ‘S

_ “These are talented‘ young’athletes',” says ‘Bonsall;
. “Most freshman are limited to a single event for a While,
but these three are already able to perform all six events-.” C

The Pitt squad is looking for their‘ second victory,

‘ which would enable them to even their record at 2-2.’ 1 ‘  .

‘Scott believes that the impressive show-

After SACC Ruling

Racing Team offers

by CINDY MORGAN

The University of Pittsburgh 7

Road Racing Team, in its sec-
ond year, is now offering train-
ing positions to men and women
18 and over.

Previously, the Sports Car
Club of America (SCCA) order-
ed that individuals must be
21 in order to occupy various
track positions and to gain mem-

bership. However, the ruling
was recently changed. opening
vast possibilities for students

while still in their undergradu
ate years. —

Some of the positions for
which individuals may train
include timing and scoring,

course marshall, flag marshal,
and observers.

Job skills acquired by active
members of the Road Racing
Team can be used in the future,
when as licensed members of
the SCCA, they will find them-

T selves directly involved with the

sport, rather than relegated to
mere sideline patronization.

Bob Fryer, driver for the team,
also points out that the road
racing organization also pro-
vides “marvelous” opportunities
for those interested in" public
relations, office work, writing,
and other positions necessary to
the tea m‘s operations.

’ corporation

“The road racing team," he
emphasizesfis probably the only
organization on campus which
gives such direct contact with
high corporate officials, offi-
cials the students meet while
searching out sponsors or doing
public relations work for the

club. These contacts are invalu-'

able to students, who upon
graduation, may need letters of
recommendation for jobs.”

Office-oriented jobs, however,
are not the only fields which
present opportunities. One chief
mechanic, for example, employ-
ed by the team for forty dollars
a week, was hired by a large
for four hundred
dollars a week. Had he not made
his contact through the team,
he may never have found such
a high-paying position.

The Pittcrew has found that
since its the only campus
organization of its kind, that
professionals have magnetically
been drawn to them.

Recently, three professionals
have joined the staff to train
members with various occupa-
tional interests in the team.

Judy Tessmer, editor for the '

SCCA publication, will handle
instruction in.the timing and
scoring areas.

Writer Bernard Pisczek, con-

   

 

varied opportunities

tributor to Autoweek and mem-
ber of the Johnstown-Tribune-
Democrat, will avail his services
to those interested in writing for
the team.

German photographer Mathew
von Staudach will serve in a
permanent advisory position» to
those interested in photograph-
ing the team’s activities.

The example set by the team
has also influenced the SCCA
to make other changes besides
the lowering of age.) A new
class of racing has been creat-
ed to appeal to college students
operating on small budgets.

Groups of individuals are now
able to purchase an economy-
type car and enter it in compe-
tition, under the stipulationthat
they do not alter it in any way.

The only addition to the stand-
ard floor model allowed is a roll
bar. However, this must be the
bolted-in variety, and not
welded.

Winner's’ cars are offered for
sale following races for $500
over the purchase price. This
insures that competitors (will
abide by the rules and not
spend a fortune “souping up”
their entries.
