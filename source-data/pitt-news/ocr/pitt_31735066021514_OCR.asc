HARRISBURG — A repeat of Pitt’s past
problems can be avoided without opening
the university’s records to the public, Pitt
President J. Dennis O’Connor told the
Pennsylvania senate education committee
yesterday.

Auditor General Barbara Hafer, who is
currently conducting a special audit at Pitt,
told the committee a different story.

“The excessive spending and greed that

Budget problems root

has been exposed through the media is an
outrage,” Hafer said. “The cavalier attitude
continued to exist, even in the midst of our
audit.”

Hafer pointed to the fact that O’Connor
has spent $420,000 in 43 days in office on
“presidential perks.”

. “That’s an average of $9,814 per day. In
addition, several key administrators were
recently granted pay increases as much as
10 percent. This is a violation of the public
trust,” she said.

O’Connor testified in opposition‘ to the
proposed amendment to the state Right to

_ diligentand serious. effort to employ what

 

 

Know act, which would make most of
Pitt's records public.

The Cowell bill would create an
unnecessary “check” on the university,
according to O’Connor.

“There are numerous avenues through
which accountability can travel. What we

need to do is to take stock of these existing _

mechanisms for accountability. Given the
number of mechanisms which are already
in place, it is not necessary to create new,
untested or seemingly simplistic ways of
achieving accountability. We need to insert

 

of cancelled classes

By Michael J. Lowe
sum‘ Writer

On the first day of classes Pitt
senior Chris Mandros was walking
to Langley _ Hall for his
Developmental Psychology

,Infancy..class, which. he needed

to graduate. _

But something seemed amiss.
No one was in the classroom.
Maybe he had the wrong time.

He had the right time, but he
chose the wrong class. His class
had been cancelled without notice
because the professor left town
one week before the start of
classes. _

This is just one of a number of
reasons that classes at Pitt are
cancelled. , ' _

Other reasons for cancellations
include -low enrollment in the
class, death or retirement of the

. professor or a lack of money in a
"departments budget to support

the class. _

“Sections of nine physical
education classes, such as
aquatics, gymnastics and
racquetball, have been cancelled
because the instructor retired,”
said Richard Bradshaw,
coordinator of basic instruction
at Trees Hall.

The psychology department

had two classes that were
cancelled this term after
professors left.

Mandros said, “I ended up

taking a class that filled my
requirement, but it wasn’t a class
that I really wanted  My whole
year was thrown out of whack.”

Donald McBurney, wassociate.

chairperson of the psychology
department, said, “In one case
we spent all summer looking for
someone to teach a class, but we
couldn’t find anyone.”

Budget constraints imposed in
the past few years decrease the
number of available classes, he
said.

He said 75 percent of all

psychology classes are full for’

the fall term. This makes it hard
for students to get exactly what
they want,_he said, and the full-
time staff in his department should
be increased.

He said, “In 1976 wehad 45 -

faculty, and today we have 37.
And we teach. more students.”
In 1976, -the 45 faculty taught
about 29,000 student credit hours,
or roughly 9667 students. Today,
a faculty of 37 teaches about
35,000 student credit hours, or
roughly 11,667 students.
Budget cuts also caused Pride

Two members of the College Republicans
woke’up at S a.m. last November, drove to the
parkway and shivered as they held a bed sheet
that read, “Honk if you support Santorum.”

Rick Santorum was later electedby a close
margin to his first term in the US. House of
Representatives.

While this type of campaigning is rare, the
College Republicans and the University
Democrats are busy preparing for the upcoming
elections.

Currently the College Republicans are working
for U.S. Senate candidate Dick Thornburgh and
Dan Fleck, a county commissioner candidate.

The University Democrats are supporting

' Harris Wofford, the interim senator replacing

the late John Heinz.

The two student groups are stuffing envelopes
and handing out fliers as well as encouraging
students to register and vote. '

In addition to campaigning, the University
Democrats are involved in community work.

‘They tutor area children and will hold a food‘

drive for Thanksgiving.

Political groups work for ’92

According to Joel Leonard, president of the
University Democrats, “Our main message is
‘We are not just a political group.’ Because
politics is about making a difference, we do
things outside of typical politics.” '

Jonathan Kurland, public relations director of
the College Republicans, wants his organization
to be a more visible group on campus that works‘
to make students more politically active.

The College Republicans want to hold a mock
election. They are in the early stages of
coordinating this, but they need a sponsor to
make it possible.

In January the College Republicans “will gear
up for the Bush/Quayle presidential campaign,”
said Jacinta Dvorak, CR president.

Because the University Democrats were recently
reorganized, they have just begun to make future
plans.

As the semester goes on, they will have more

‘ concrete plans, according to UD vice president,

Shawn McCleran.

The University Democrats will meet on Sept.
26 at 6:30 p.m. in Room 543 of the William Pitt
Union, and the College Republicans will meet
Sept. 30 at 8:50 p.m. in Room 527 of the student
union. —

had to be cut because it was to be

“It is very difficult to bring on

Hall, chairperson of the history
department. ,

He has seen the number of
history faculty members decline
since 1980. I

Chairs from the anthropology,

Frederick J. Koloc of the

students sign up for a class, then
it is subject to cancellation unless

it is needed in order for a student .

A political science class was
cancelled this term because of
low student enrollment, but when
other sections filled up, the class
was added again.

process for this region.

There are still many people who find organ donation to be

\ a thing of science fiction. “There is still a dark cloud surrounding

I organ donation," said Kail. “Our goal is to increase education
about donation, and in doing so we will increase the number
of people signing up."

PTF sends out its message in a number of ways. One of the
most familiar may be the organ-donor sticker that people may
place on the back of their driver’s license.

Other methods include seminars that introduce people to the
recipients as well as relatives of donors.

“Kids on The Block” is one way that PTF is bringing the
message to younger people. “Kids” uses child-size puppets to

' explain a handicap or some other medical problem. Pittsburgh
is only one of two cities that produces a “Kids” skit that involves
organ donation.

According to Kail, the need for organs among adults and
children is relatively equal, although pediatric organs are
occasionally easier to come by. “Parents are very willing to
donate their children's organs. They feelthis gives them some
control over the tragedy that has happened,” said Kai]. A

Crui is i ng
Continued from page I
was thrown into the public eye in

July, when a petition circulated .

by Sue Hughes, a North Oakland
resident, requested city council
to “hold a public hearing" to
institute an anti-Cruising
ordinance.

“The publicity surrounding the
cruising issue caused the cruisers
to settle down,” said Dan Cohen,‘
the City Council representative
for the North Oakland area. “But
the cruisers are coming back. A
20-year-old problem can’t be
solved overnight.” "

Hughes said the problem is
already starting up again. “Last
Sunday 15 to 16 cars went around
five to six times‘ between 1 and 2
a.m.,” she said. “The only cars
driving are the cruisers.”

But Cohen does not believe
that the cruising ordinance is the
right solution. The ordinance
would make it illegal to pass
traffic checkpoints two times in a
one-hour period or five times in
a three-hour period between

midnight and 5 a.m.

People,on Fzjftb

equal amount of
traffic and some-
how manage to get

—Randy Forrester

First-time offenders could be
fined $100, and second and third

‘offenses would incur fines up to

$500.

Two years ago Tyron, Pa.
adopted an ordinance similar to
Riccardi’s, and Chief John T.
Cooper of the Tyron police
department said it has been very
successful in stopping the cruising
problem in their area.

“You can’t imagine how bad
the problem was,” Cooper said.
“It was an unbelievably constant
string of traffic. You had to wait
five to 10 minutes to get through

The Pitt News observed little
extraneous traffic in North
Oakland on North Dithridge
between Forbes and Fifth avenues
from 12:30am. to 1:30 a.m. last
Saturday.

One or two cars passed every
few minutes, and noise was
created by a few college students
walking to and from parties on
North Dithridge. One car radio
was played loudly.

Although the ordinance in

Tyron has been successful in

solving the cruising problem,
Cooper said, “Someone is going
to have the money to push it to
the state or Supreme Court, and
some judge is going to say it’s
unconstitutional.”

In late July, Cohen, Hileman
and Forrester had an informal
meeting to discuss possible
alternative solutions to the
cruising problem, but Cohen said
they were unable to discuss their
ideas as of yet.

“I believe there are concrete
ideas that can solve this problem,”
Hileman said. “I have sympathy
for the residents there, but Sue
Hughes’ and [some other
residents’l preoccupation with
cruising is neurotic.”

“My perception was that there
was never a problem,” Forrester
said. “The problem about noise
and traffic was a ruse  People

on Fifth Avenue handle an equal

amount of traffic and somehow

manage to get a pleasant night’s

sleep."
Finding an alternative site for
cruising is “very hard to do,”
Forrester replied. “These cruising
areas have been known for
decades. We’re also suspicious
.that a third place would have
similar problems.”
Forrester said that he was not
optimistic about the problem ever
being solved.

"lOpenness can’t be opposed

. J. Dennis O’Connor is quickly losing the faith that
 . students, faculty and staff had restored in him to “save” Pitt
A from its internal destruction.

At a Pennsylvania senate education committee meeting
in Harrisburg yesterday, O'Connor expressed some
, viewpoints opposing his original plan of ‘Topennessf’
O’Connor does not feel the Cowell bill, on its way to the
-A /state senate is necessary for Pitt. If passed, the‘ bill would
“I open the financial records of statefrelated universities —
encompassing Pitt, Penn State, the University of
L H . Pennsylvania and Lincoln. In light of the recent scandals

 

 ' . surrounding Pitt, including the food—services expenditures, 1

(Wesley Posvar’s multi-rnillion dollar retirementperks and
O’Connor’s own appropriations of funds for redecoration,
the University of Pittsburgh administration has made it
 more than obvious that we need a strong checks and
if balances system. . '

O’Connor said a general university budget and a cost-

 
 

Library.

But a general budget is useless to students who want to
see exactly where their money is going.

.._ O’Connor counteracted complaints against his

 . disapproval of the Cowell bill by mentioning that at the

 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was
the provost, tight restrictions on state appropriations
“severely debilitated that university.”

It is no secret that UNC is in a much better financial state
than Pitt, considering in-state tuition at Chapel Hill costs
a mere $1,008 per term, according to Peterson’s Register
of Higher Education, 1991 edition. Also, not only is UNC
ranked higher than Pitt academically, it also has a much
better reputation than Pitt.

If checks on UNC deteriorated the university, it would
be ‘depressing to know what in-state tuition was before
the checks began. _

Perhaps the most ironic statement in O”Connor’s speech
to_ the senate concerned his commitment to Pitt.

 “As chief executive of the university I have accepted the

I ultimate responsibility for seeing that all funds from

whatever ‘source are spent in reasonable and appropriate
ways.” A ‘

This “new era of openness” is quickly crumbling before
the university community’s eyes. O’Connor promised us
understanding, something that was quite lacking in
Wesley Posvar’s stint as Pitt president. That, too, has not
yet been apparent since O’Connor took office on Aug. 1.

The true test of O’Connor’s faith to Pitt should be most
visible at budget—hearing time in February 1992.

O’Connor has caused the Pitt community considerable
aggravation in the past few weeks. W

continuation of the past.

National health care re—examined

Harris Wofford, the appointed
senator from Pennsylvania, is hell-
bent on making “universal” (read:
“socialized”) health care the major
issue in his election campaign.
Apparently he believes that this
issue is the single most pressing
one for American families fully
capable of bringing him neck—in-
neck with his much-better— known
rival,’ ex—Governor- Dick
Thornburgh. '

This issue, though, won’t do it
for him. The basic fact is that most
Pennsylvanians (70 percent,
according to a congressional
report) have health coverage
included as a basic job benefit.
Many of the ones that don’t'are
covered by government programs
such as Medicare and Medicaid.
Only 8.3 percent of Americans
aren’t covered at all. The crisis
facing the health care industry is

simply one that does not affect
large numbers of voters directly.

Everyone can agree, though,
that a full-scale crisis is waiting
right around the bend, even if
most Americans can’t feel it.
Senator Wofford’s interest in this,
important issue is, therefore,.very
responsible,and foresighted. The
solutions he seems to be
proposing, though, ' are
increasingly irresponsible and
myopic.

We don’t need to go far to find
socialized medicine — our close
neighbor to the north, Canada,
has had such a system in place for
years. A close examination of this

Rob
Lewis

system shows huge structural
flaws that would greatly harm the

quality of American health care if ’

it is transplanted here.

For one thing, the Canadian’

model does not control costs well
at all — hospitals in British
Columbia contract out to hospitals
in Washington state to do open-
heart surgery, because it is
cheaper there..tThe only way the
Canadian system has found it can
control extremely high
bureaucratic costs is to closely
control health—care rates. This
policy, though, has had the
perverse economic effect ‘of
producing long waiting lists for
basic medical services. One
example: A woman usually has to
wait four to six months for a pap

smear, though an “urgent” smear ’

can be rushed through in two.

‘Compare this to the‘ instant

availability of health services in
the States.

Also, should the national health
service in Canada act negligently,
there is little legal recourse for the
victims. Suing the government is
a long, cumbersome process that
often leaves‘ plaintiffs worse off
than when they began. One
reason some doctors in America
support -national health care is
because of the assumption that

their malpractice insurance will
go down. But will it, as in Canada,
totally remove doctors from
accountability to the public?

I would argue that the reason.

for the incredibly high cost of
health care in America is too mu ch

government involvement, not too '

little. Hospitals and physicians

would have to keep costs down J

and offer competitive rates if they
all had to compete against each
other.‘ . ‘

Their rates, though, are closely
tied to what the government
mandates they charge for
Medicare and Medicaid patients-
amounts that, when investigated

item by item, seem grossly high._

Hospitals of course do not mind

charging $200 for a $12 mattress"

pad, since they are confident that
the charges will always be paid in
full by. government welfare
programs or insurance
companies. _

Senator Wofford is a staunch
liberal.  such, he is required to
weep and cry over terrible social
issues and wail that something
must be done. The good senator,
though, must realize what most
Americans realized long ago --
that more and bi gger government
cannot cure every social ill. The

- evidence is clear that the solutions

vaguely articulated in the Wofford
TV ads are the last thing the
American medical system needs.

Women ’s tennis remains unbeaten with win over St. Francis 

By Joe Foner
For T be Pitt News

The Pitt women’s tennis team is 5-0 after
white-washing St. Francis 9-0 in impressive
fashion at the Cost Center yesterday. There
was a photographer present, and the team
played like it knew he was coming.

In singles action, Julie LoPrinzi won her
match 6-2, 6-1, over Kristi Liebau, while

her doubles partner, Erika Devins won her V

singles match over Karen Vallese of St.
Francis 6-0, 6-1.

6 Other singles matches includedJennifer
Jacobs’ win over Stacey Spence 6-1, 6-0;

Steelers’ 2-1 st

Colleen Kujawski beating Jennifer Pauley
6-1, 6-1 and Gwen McIntyre over Kim
Kosc 6-0, 6-0.

It was a relaxed atmosphere, as several
players wore shorts, which if you follow
women’s tennis is not the usual attire.
However Pitt’s Raquel Cepeda (one of the
guilty party) said, “It was more like a
practice than a match — she was like a
practice partner and was setting up shots
for me to put away,” after defeating Peg
Powlowski of St. Francis 6-1, 6-0.

LoPrinzi, the Lady Panthers’ top singles
player, echoed Cepeda’s sentiments. “All
of the regular season matches get us ready

for the big tournaments later in the season, ”
she said. , -

In doubles action, LoPrinzi and Devins
beat Liebau and Powlowski 6-2, 6-1. Cepeda

and Jacobs beat Vallese and Pauley 6-1, 6- .

1 and Audrea Passarello and Chris Orie, in
their first match as a doubles team, were
victorious over Spence and Kosc 6-4, 6-4.

“That was Passarello’s first match of the
year,” said Coach George Dieffenbach.
“They worked well as a team; they were
getting to the net and hitting volleys well.”

Dieffenbach added, “This match was
good for experience and was a confidence
builder. The matches we're playing right

art meaningless against E

now (during the regular season) are to get
us ready for the more competitive matches
later in the season.”

So don't-be fooled by the scores folks
even though the scores seem lopsided
and they look like they might have been
ho—hum, the matches were beneficial to
the team.

Dieffenbach also noted that he. was

happy with the progress of the team and 1

hopes that they are ready for upcoming
matches against Canisius this Sunday and
Youngstown State, who beat the Panthers
5-4 last year. Both matches will be at the
Cost Center.

By Ryan Buncher
Staﬂ" Writer

Want some good news? The
Steelers are 2-1. What does that

_R mean? Not much.

So far they are doing exactly
what they did last year, beating
up on mediocre teams and losing
whenever they run into a good

- team. Beating the New England-

Patriots and San Diego Chargers
isn’t exactly cause for excitement.
_Yes, as every other newspaper
and every TV newscast just had
to say, “If Buffalo’s Jim Kelly is
the worst thing that can happen
to an NFL defense, a Patriot
quarterback is the probably the
best.”

The worst part is they actually

 had to struggle against the

Chargers and Patriots, and they
were hammered by the Bills.
Some say that a few calls by the
officials cost the Steelersa chance
to take the momentum. Yeah,
right, and the Chicago Cubs are
only a few umpiring calls away
from having won the last 10 World
Series. The Bills’ offense scored
almost at will until Buffalo coach
Marv Levy called off his dogs late

A, in the fourth quarter. If the Steelers

I

had scored a few more times,
Kelly might have ended up with
eight or nine scoring passes
instead of six.

Basically they are starting slow
again, but the schedule is-helping
them. This week’s game is a
major test. Starting 5-Iwould be
important for a team that has dug
itself a hole at the beginning of
the last three seasons. They
haven’t started a season 3-] since
1982. An opening day loss to a
very bad Cleveland team came
back to haunt the Steelers last
year, as they missed the play-offs
by one game.

Just as important is the Steeler
opponent this weekend, the
Philadelphia Eagles. This team is
nowhere near as good as the
Bills, but they are a good team.
The Eagles offense is battered.
Quarterback Randall
Cunningham is probably" out for
the season with a knee injury.
Thomas Sanders, the team’s
leading rusher, receiver Calvin
Williams and offensive guard Ron
Solt, arguably their best lineman,

were all hurt last week and will ‘

not play against the Steelers. Still,
Pittsburgh faces a defense that
can be dominating at times, such
as last week when they collected
12 sacks and shut down Emmitt
Smith on the way to blanking the
Dallas Cowboys. All Smith had

been doing was leading’the_.

league in rushing entering the
game. »‘

This is a game the Steelers can
win. More importantly, it is the
kind of game they must win if
they are going to be a playoff
team. They did not beat a team
with a winning record last year.
The best team they beat was
Houston in Week 2, but that was
when the Oilers were still working
out the kinks in the run-and-
shoot offense they had just begun
to use for the first time. Moving
up to another level means beating
good teams. ,

One key will be the play of the
offensive line. The Eagle
defensive front is too good to be
totally controlled, but they will
need to get some semblance of a
running game going and at least

give quarterback Bubby Brister‘
. enough protection to get off short

passes. 1
The defense must shut the
Eagles down and ‘should. The

Philadelphia line was weak before .

problems handling short-range
passes, and the Eagles have two
of the best underneath receivers
in theleague in tight end Keith
Jackson and running back Keith
Byars, but that is a problem for
them in every game.

AROUND THE LEAGUE:
Another problem that will be

with them for every game is

playoffs last year: the Raiders,

three are struggling, but they are

For The Pitt News

The Pitt soccer team continued _its
unbeaten ways ‘Wednesday night with a
convincing 4-0 victory over Canisius at Pitt
Stadium.

First-year player Eric Prex scored two
first—half goals to pace the Panthers, who
ran their record to 3-0-1.

Pitt opened the game with strong
offensive pressure. Nick Liberati nearly
got the games first goal, when he shot a
pass from Prex towards goal, only to be

denied by Canisius goalie,Todd White.
Minutes later, senior Ivan Amayo set up
midfielder Ted Noethling with a crossing
pass, but the ensuing shot ﬂew left of the
goal for a goal kick.

The Panthers ﬁnally broke through for
their first tally nine minutes into the first
half. After receiving a pass from Amayo
from the right side, Prex fought off a
defender and fired past the helpless Golden
Griffins goalie.

Canisius responded with the first of
what would be few scoring opportunities.
Midfielder Luciano Gallo attempted without

success to crack the Pitt defense, which
responded ﬂawlessly to the directions
called by senior goalie Tim Sobelman.
Sobelman registered his third shutout.
Canisius received a fatal blow early
when midfielder Igor Szynarowski injured
his left ankle. An offensive leader,
Szynarowski left the game at the five

' minute mark, never to return.

“Scoring early on and [Szynarowski]
getting hurt really put Canisius in a bind,”
said Pitt Coach Joe Luxbacher.

Overall, he was satisfied with the team
effort, particularly the offensive chances

created by the defense. “We played better
defense against St.John’s, but -(against
Canisius) we created more offensive
opportunities tonight,” Luxbacher said.
Pitt made it 2—0»midway through the first

half 'on a slick dribble drive by Prex. After» ‘-

splitting two defenders, Prex served the‘

ball to the left corner of the goal, far out of
the reach of netminder White.

The remainder of the first half was

' controlled by the. Panthers, who continued

to sustain pressure on the Canisius defense.

Raiders have too many weapons
to falter here.

Look for a physical, hard-hitting
game with the old school bunch
from LA teaching these
perpetrators a lesson. Here’s your
pick.of the week.

Take Los Angeles -2 1/2.

(+8) New York Jets (1-2) at
Chicago Bears (3-0), Monday, 9
p.m‘., ABC.

Four weeks into the season,
and we ﬁnally like a Monday
night line. It’s September, and the
Bears are red—hot. Nothing new
here. Chicago is 25-2 in their past
25 September games.

The Jets have played much
better than anyone could have
imagined but have only one “W”
to show for it.

The unassertive Jim Harbaugh
is quietly having a steady season
for Chicago. Last week he
completed 60 percent of his
passes for 221 yards with one
touchdown and one interception.

If he continues to put up
numbers like that every week
and learns when to scramble,
defenses would face an
impossible task stopping Neal
Anderson and the ground game.

Anderson hasn't had his
accustomed blazing start but did

  

produce the nicest run of the

season last week, ‘a 42-yard jaunt
that climaxed with a five-yard
dive that landed him just on the

pylon. -

The Bear defense has always
been the strength of this club but
they’ve changed their style a little
bit this season.

They’re now more of a “bend
but.don’tb/reak" defense, yielding
308.3. yards per game but still

enough from Jerry Glanville‘s
influence that they_might- take
advantage of it.

One challenge the Steelers will
probably not have to deal with is
the Cincinnati Bengals. They are
0-5 and will probably be 0-4 after
playing the unbeaten Redskins.
They have had trouble in odd-
numbered years lately, but it may

,. be that this team is just on the

way down. The most disturbing
sign for this team is that they are
not scoring. The defense never
was very good. James Brooks
and the offensive line are getting
older. Ickey Woods will probably
never make it all the way back.
The talent level on defense is
improving, but it is still not
enough. If the Steelers finally

. beat them this season, the collapse

will be complete.

yards on 12 carries against Buffalo
last week, and the aging Freeman

‘McNeil has also seen the ball

much more than expected. Al

- Toon and Rob Moore are an

outstanding combo at the
wideouts. : _ _
New York’s run defense is 7th
in the league, so don't expect
Anderson to crank itup too much.
Chicago is coming off an
emotional 20-17 win over the
New York Giants and could be
ripe for a letdown. ’Ihey’re getting
major attention with the sudden
demise of the ‘Niners and Giants
and the Jets are the perfect team
to shatter this. They covered a 9
1/2-point spread against the Bills
and are due for an upset.

\‘The Bears struggle against lesser
clubs, as evidenced by their 21-
20 win against Tampa Bay two
weeks ago and never score a lot
of points unless their defense
and special teams provide the
spark. This is one area that they
are much stronger in than the
Jets. We don’t think that this will
be a factor here.The wind will be
blowin’ some Jet glue through
Chicago, dazing the Kodiaks, as
the Jets are ready to shock.
Take New York +8.

Could it be another boring
Steeler game?

Pittsburgh Steelers (2-1) at (-3
1/2) Philadelphia Eagles (2-1).
Jimmy Mac versus the Bubster.
Let’s hope they both survive this
one. 2
Philly enters this game with

the league's top defense. Through

three games, they have an NFL-
best 16 sacks and have allowed
56 yards per game on the ground.
Troy Aikman and Dallas were
decimated to the tune of 11 sacks
and 90 total yards in a 24-0
shellacking at Texas Stadium.
However, the Steelers’ offensive

line has been very effective,»

allowing only five sacks in three

games.Prob1em is they’ve faced.

no quality defensive lines yet.
The Birds’ offensive line has
been anything but steady and
goes to war without injured guard
Ron Solt this week. Not good.
Barry Foster will be a key man
for Pittsburgh on Sunday. Against
the Patriots he picked up only 32
yards on 14 carries. He needs to
take some pressure off Brister

against this front. Philly probably‘

won’t even bother to run the ball.
They haven’t had much success
on the ground, ranking 27th in
the league, and starting tailback
Thomas Sanders is out with a
sprained ankle.

The Birds love defensive
coordinator Bud Carson’s new

scheme, which doesn’t require
them to blitz as they had under
Buddy Ryan. The Steelers will
have to throw short in hopes of
gradually dentin g the middle with
Eric Green.

Wideout Fred Barnett leads the
NFC in receiving and is emerging
as one of the most dangerous
deep threats in football. Not
Sunday, though. Jim McMahon
won’t have time to throw many
deep patterns, and with starting
receiver Calvin Williams also out
with a separatedshoulder, the
Steelers will have the luxury of
doubling up on Barnett.

Or will they?

The Birds will go to their ball-
control offense, featuring a lot of
three-step drops for McMahon
and many passes to all—pro Keith
Jackson and Keith Byars.

The Steelers should put as much/
pressure as possible on McMahon
in hopes of causing turnovers. L

Brister will feel like he works
on Liberty Ave. with the number

of times he’s gonna be on his

back Sunday. Both defenses
should establish control early and
hammer away all day.

In a.game that could be uglier
than a Derek Willis jumper, take
the Birds to win it in true
champion fashion.

Take Philadelphia -3 1/2.

peppered the Griffin defense with offensive forays. While they
didn’t score, their efforts had an affect on the stamina of the
Canisius players.

Pitt continued their dominance, scoring seven minutes into
the second half. JuniorJ.R. Perdue scored off a nice corner kick
by captain~Nick Liberati, placinga shot to the right of the net.

The final Panther goal was scored by Noethling, who was set
up by senior Mark Brehm. Brehm dribbled from midﬁeld to the
top of the box, then sent a perfect pass to Noethling, who

finished it off in the upper left corner of the goal.

Antbemic Brits bring cynical 1 attitude back to the US. 

By Rob Penman
T be Pitt News

OK, folks, it’s time to don those
doc—martins one more time;

‘ — although they might have been

mothballed along with your red
suspenders, it’s time. One more
time for those celtic minstrel
politicos — New Model Army,
who for the last 11 years have
been on their soapbox, stumping
for equality and justice, far
outlasting Johnny Rotten, The
Redskins, Mick Jones, Stiff Little
Fingers, The Business or any other
Anglo—crown bashers you can
think of.

They were inspired by the
legacy of Oliver Cromwell, who
in the 17th century, along with
his New Model Army, liberated
the English peasants from the
ruling monarchy. With material
like “Slst State” and “Liberal
Education," NMA sees itself in a
similar light, not as a military or
political party but as a conduit to
change via its prosaic and musical
agenda.

But that’s not to say their creed
is void of deeds. In the past they
have organized benefits for
striking coal miners and have
established a heroin treatment
clinic.

One other thing you find in

‘their spiel is an anti-drug policy.

“I’m not going to thrust it down
anyone’s throat, butl don’t drink
very much, andl don’t take drugs.
We’re not very much in love with
the old rock, self—destructive bit,”
said lead vocalist Sullivan,
formally known as “Slade, the
Leveler.”

Earmarked by simplistic
rhythms, their sound is standard
Caucasian rock that is goosestep-
friendly. Fuzzed electrics and
undistorted acoustic guitars

accompany vocals produced with 1

crystal clarity, so we all can absorb
and collate their message minus
any difficulty.

But lately they have attempted
to shed their purist and puritanical
nature. Their most recent release,

. Impurity, which is a loud, vicious,

Slices of sub-cultureserved up in ‘Slacke’

Unemployed.” So
you know Slackers;
you probably are a

 

By Brian Berger
Showcase Editor

Like the roving art cart that
strolls through the friendly
neighborhoods of Pittsburgh
during the summer, director
Richard Linklater’s near-
documentary “Slacker” is a roving
freak cart, full of colorful,
‘whacked—out, harmless characters
who dwell in Austin, Texas. The
film is a non—stop jaunt through
the lives of some 100+ Austinians.
The viewer is teased with a brief
snippet of their intriguing
lifestyles, which have been
classified “Slacker.”

Using only a handful of “real”
actors, Linklater recruited people
off the street and carefully scripted
these people into real time. The
film covers the course of a full
day, 24 hours, and the feel is
nearly improvisational because
of the oddness of the folks shown
and the amount of characters.

So what is a “Slacker?” I hate to
try and give a descriptive title to
“Slacker” because it seems like
an attempt to‘ put the film on
some type of simplistic level, so
I’ll let Linklater handle my
mbmma

“Slackers are educated people
just killing time, so theireducation
continues but along unsu pervised
paths — the quest for knowledge
and all that vigor is still there, but

' there’s no action,” Linklater said.

The “Slacker” promo buttons refer
to them as “Young, Gifted,

slacker yourself,
shunning work, living
outside the economy, H
waiting for a true 
calling, not buying 
what’s been planned. 
This generation, 7
while angry and
critical of society and
government, is
incapable of rev-
olution; it’s far too 3;,
exhausting. A rally
maybe. But1et’s break
from the definitive section of the
review and explain why the film
is_worth the price of admission.
“Slacker” is like nothing you’ve
ever seen on the big screen. The
characters’ anti-social, mad
behavior leaves an invigorating
quality that cries freedom. Moving
from character to character, the
transition is relatively smooth for
such a formidable chore, and the
viewer is never lost’ among the
maze of people. The flow is

Some of the Slackers from Richard Linklater's first 

people. The flow is incredible,
full of incidental meetings with
counter—cultu re types on the edge
of reality.

But what makes “Slacker” such
a great film is that as it tackles a
new movement in society, it shies
away from the documentary style
by not examining the culture just
showing it in its everyday fashion,
raw and in the flesh. By doing so,‘
Linklater allows the viewer tosee
the freedom of the lifestyle minus

the analysis. It
leaves a loose feel,
kinda like wearing
your Jordans half
tied.

But the main
thrust of the film
is the wonderful
characters. While
many are only
shown for a
minute or two,
you wish that
many of the
characters woufd
return because of
their ﬂair. They
never do, though; 100+ people
and no repeats. The camera is a
loaded Uzi here, aimed at a cast
ranging from conspiracy-theory
lackeys to an old man obsessed
with mass murderers.

Linklater is the first “Slacker” in
the film, arriving by bus in Austin,
taking a cab and discussing
philosophy with an uninterested
cabbie. He then hops out and
witnesses a hit-and—ru n. Here we
lose Linklater but gain the driver

who gets out, enters his house, C

receives a phone call that tells

him his mother has just been hit T

by a car. Classic.

Another segment involves the ‘

conspiracy guy, who follows a
stranger out of a coffee shop and
rattles off a host of theories
ranging from NASA to the CIA,

arguably the film’s high point. ‘ N
The Madonna pap—smear lady,

the guy with an uncountable

amount of TVS and VCRS who is O .

obsessed with the recorded and
the man who enters a coffee

shopandis harassedbyastranger ‘O '

who tells him and is then accosted
by the hostess, who tells" him in
freaky fashion to stop trau-

   

matizing women with sex. She '.

should know because she’s a
doctor, she tells him.

Chock full o’ nuts, “Slacker” is
a beautiful debut from writer,

director and producer Richard —~ _
Linklater. The plethora of ‘

characters, ideas and philosophies
make for some true entertainment,

and it’s hilarious to boot. Plus the A

title rules.

Use Yourlllusion His the album
that we waited for. Every song on
this disc is great. Even though
“You Could Be Mine” can be
heard almost every time you turn
on the radio or MTV, it is still a
good song.

If anyone has ever written a
ballad that should fire to number
1, it’s G’N’R and their new song,
“Don’t Cry.” There are two
versions of this song, one on each
of the albums. Both versions are
damn good. Axl shows that he
can lay back on the vocals and
make them mellow. New
drummer Matt Sorum gives the
drums a soft touch that really
adds to the song instead of
detracting, and Slash and Izzy lay
back on the guitars until it’s
necessary to pick it up.

On I, there are some average
songs, some good songs, but alas,
there are also bad ones. One of
the bad ones is a cover of Paul
McCartney's “Live And Let Die.”
It’s a straight— forward cover, but
it is neither as hard nor as good as
the original.

“Perfect Crime” has a guitar riff
that sounds familiar,- and the
whole song just sounds too much

like something else, although I
can’t quite place it.

“The Garden” is a good song,
and Alice Cooper helps out on
vocals, but is it really a GNR
song? I can’t quite decide. Slash
does play a good slide guitar,
but I think this should really be
a Cooper song.

“November Rain” is really a
shocker. It’s almost as good as
“Don’t Cry,” but if it weren't for
Axl’s distinctive vocals, you
might think that this was
someone else’s song.

“Bad Obsession” is a bluesy
song, and Michael Monroe, Axl’s
friend and former vocalist of the
now-defunct Hanoi Rocks, plays
his harmonica on this song for
an interesting touch. Other than
the harmonica, it’s nothing
special.

Moving on to the album we
have waited for. Use Your
Illusion II is a great album. Like

I said before, every song is '

great, from the opening “Civil
War” to the closing “My World,”
G’N’R just performs well.

The best song on the album
and the best G’N’R song ever
written is “Estranged.” Slash

punches out some killer blues solos; .

Axl mixes up talking and singing
well; the piano parts are great, and
the whole song just has a feeling
about it. I could feel emotion
pouring from this song.

They have finally released a new
copy of “Knockin’ On Heaven’s
Door.”
available by them if you look hard
enough, and this version is even
better than the live one. I like this
better than Dylan’s original and
100 times better than Clapton’s
cover. This song is also being
played with feeling and emotion.
The solos are still great, and the
addition of a background chorus
really brings the song up.

Duff even sings a song, and he
has a good voice. The song is “So
Fine.” .

I hate to repeat it, but I have to.
Every song on 11 is great, and to go
on about it would be boring to you
readers. If you are interested in
getting into G’N’R, buy their albums
in this order: Use Your Illusion II,
Appetz'teForDestruction, GN’RLies,
and then get Use Your Illusion I.

The meter works out in this way:

follows the theme of a band
going from rags to riches,
however the motion picture falls
short ofoffering much more than
a feature—length music video.
The Commitments lacks
substance on any other level than
what is offered on the surface.
There are too many characters.

. As a result, it makes it difficult to

devote enough dialogue and
attention to even a few of them in
order _to give the characters any
dynamics or substance. There
are 10 members in the band
alone, not to mention Rabbitte or

{\- Commitments lacks soul in movie, not music:

never fully realized. It is even
difficult to put faith in Rabbitte as
being a competent manager who

can bring this band to stardom...

Before becoming a manger, he
was collecting unemployment for
two years.

The Commitments does have _

can be questioned whether‘

has the effect of being snapped
out ofblissful slumber with a jolt
ofelectricity and a crash ofsome

It is not quite what one might

over—saturated those two LPs. 1 0

Instead what you have is the
synthesized progressive sound
ofthe latter albums accompanied
with a guitar backbone the likes
of which have not been since
Grace Under Pressure. In other
words, it’s Presto with balls.
At long last lead guitarist Alex
Lifeson has been given the green
light to really kick it out. This is
evident on the tracks “Dreamline,”
“Heresy,” “Face Up” and “The
Big Wheel,” where the lead guitar
sets the tone on all four tracks.
Lifeson also has some impressive
guitar solos on “Face Up” and the
title track, “Roll the Bones,” but
the solo on “Ghost of a Chance”
is not only quick but very smooth,
and it rivals the solo on “Kid
Gloves” (Grace UnderPressure).
The "best songs from the new
LP include “Dreamline,” “Roll the
Bones,” “The Big Wheel” and the
sleeper of the album, “Face Up.”
What makes them so good is the
past-Rush style that creeps its
way in, creating something a little
harder than what has been seen
in a while- _

This album also features an
instrumental. It is called '\Where’s
My Thing?’ It is the fourth part of
the “Gangster of Boats” trilogy.

this one is quite different. It
celebrates each member’s mastery
of their respective instrumental
disciplines, and while it does not
have the metal edge of its
aforementioned predecessor, it's
still damn good. Picture if you
will “Marathon” (from Power
Windows) without lyrics but with
a lot more spunk. Also Geddy
Lee’s bass is tough in this one.

“Neurotica” runs a little harder,
but “I-Ieresy” is a little slower and
a bit lackluster.

The LP’s one real loser is
“Bravado.” This one is just
borrring. It’s redeemingquality is

good on this track. He has toned
down the shrill that has turned
away Rush fans for years.

' I know, I*know. I haven’t yet
mentioned Neil Peart’s drum licks
yet. They are, as usual, excellent.
The speed and complexity are
beyond compare. But he sacriﬁces
creativity for those attributes and
sometimes becomes predictable.

Peart’s greatest contribution to
this LP are his lyrics. He writes
the stuff, and, as is also usual,

they are both thoughtful and_

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, September 19, 1991

 

 

Soundings

Continued
from page (S-6

Peart’s theme is one which dispels
faith in outside forces and shuns"
any notion of fatalism. Basically
Peart tells us that we are all the
captains of our own ships,
deciding our own fate.

“Why are we here / Because
we’re here/ Roll the Bones / Why
Does it happen / Because it
happens / Roll the Bones.” Rolling
bones or dice is a game of chance,
and Peart suggests that life also is
a game of chance.

Speaking of “Roll the Bones,”
this tune has a rap in it. That's
right, a rap. It’s not your NWA-
type thing, but it’s a rap, and it is
really cool.

And as Rush lyrics- have often
done in the past, they reach out
to the adolescent dreamer. It is
unmistakable in “Drearnline.” “We
are young / Wandering the face
of the Earth / Wondering what
our dreams might be worth /
Learning that we’re only immortal
/ for a limited time.” Sound
familiar? “Subdivisions” maybe?

All in all, this album is just
quality music. A must for the
Rush junkie and worth a try even
if you're not. Geddy Lee has
softened his screech and Alex

Lifeson has become a dominant '

force once again, and so Rush
rocks and rolls. While Rush is not
traditionally a pop chart buster
(in other words, you can’t dance
to them), look for “Dreamline,”
“Spin the Wheel” and “Roll the
Bones” to climb the charts as
high as anything will.

a little too far-fetched to work
effectively.

One particular shining moment
during the movie occurs when
Rabbitte places an advertisement
in the daily paper for prospective
band members. The result is a
wide variety of respondents
ranging from a Boy George look-
alike and a p1easant-valley-
Sunday hippie to a hulking punk,
who is into Barry Manilow. The
odd thing is Rabbitte finds all of
the musicians outside of the open
auditions. Instead he finds them
through the grapevine (no Marvin
Gaye Motown pun intended).

Aside from the audition scene
and a few choice one—liners, the
comedy in The Commitments falls

 

short as well. Parker even has to
resort to the passing of gas in an
enclosed stolen truck to get a
laugh.

One interesting aspect of the
film is that of the overall
relationship among the band
members. On stage, they are hot
and possess an incredible flair for
their trade. Off stage, there exists
much adversity and animosity. It

is an extreme wonder that they
manage to pull of f the high quality
of music that they do, considering
the tensions backstage. Most
everyone in the band hates the
obnoxious and gluttonous Deco,
even though his voice provides
the drive for the band’s music.
Also, the three female back—up
singers, who are friends in the
beginning, end up at odds
because all of them eventually
share in relations with the
religiously fanatical trumpet
player, Joey “The Lips” Fagan. A
Parker commentary on religion
and sex perhaps? The band plays
soul but has no soul within the

individual members. How could
they begin to achieve their mission
of giving the Dublin working-
class a common identity in soul,
if they cannot even gamer it for
themselves?

What The Commitments needs
is a smaller band where the
characters could be developed,

_ and as a result the conflicts and

turmoil could be understood
better. The music is good, but it
cannot save The Commitments
from lacking any depth or
substance development. Whether
the Commitments make it big or
not, the way the story is portrayed,
it really would not matter.
