Pitt Money Bill NearsVote

Administrative eyes are on Harrisburg. where the University of
Pittsburgh Appropriations Bill waits for passage by both bodies ofthe
State General Assembly. ,

State Senate Bill No. 854 has just been introduced into the Senate

- Appropriations Committee, according to Joseph Boran, assistant
executive director of the committee.

Boran said that final passage would take place by the end ofJune.
However, passage of the bill rests on passage of the state’s general
budget, since Pitt is a non-preferred institution.

The bill calls for a total allocation of $74,553,000, representing a
total increase of 4.9 percent over last year, and an increase of 5.5
percent for the university’s educational and general expenses, in line
with Goverogr_Th0rnburg’s reccomendation. V

According to Dennis McManus, assistant director of the universi-
ty’s office of governmental relations, the allocation also represents a
$212,000 increase in funding for the School of Medicine, and no
increases for student aid.

Knobil Elected to Academy

Pitt Med School Faces
Tentative Tuition

By SETH LU BOVE

Pitt News Slcill Writer

Pitt’s School of Medicine has a
bad case ofthe financial flu this year.

And the bug bit one more time last
week, as students found out their
tuition would be tentatively hiked to
$7.900 for in-state and $l l,850 for
out-of-state students.

This would mean an increase of
$l60 and $2,956 respectively over
this year's tuition.

 

Donald Leon. dean of the School
of Medicine, broke the news to
approximately 150 students last Fri-
day in a meeting at Scaife Hall
arranged by the students. , L

Leon told the students the figures
will remain tentative until the State
Legislature has passed the.'l98l—82 7
budget. Afterthat: the board of_trus-.

Cheerleaders, golf caddies, morti-

- cians and '4-H ‘club members_ are

among those eliiiible for the 250.000

_no_n-governmental scholarships .

available to college students.

Last year, according to “Student
College Aid", a nationwide compu-
terized scholarship locatorservice,
$l35,000,000 in scholarships from
corporations, colleges, unionsand
other public and private organiza-
tions went unused.

“lf a student were to go through
all 250,000 scholarship listings at the
rate of ‘one a minute it would take

. 4000 hours to find them all.”-

  
 
 
 
 
  
    

    

  
   

Pitt medical school students were told last week atavmeeting
in Scaife Hall their tuition may increase...

Coincidently, it‘s the state that has
been causing most of the school’s
problems. according to Leon.

“I think the House and Senate
perceive physicians as, wealthy,"
Leon told reporters, so they aren't
increasing medical school subsidies.

Since 1972, commonwealth sup-
port for Pitts and other state-related
medical schools has remained at a
consistent $7,465 per student,
according to university statistics.

The statistics also reveal the
actual cost of medical education has

risen by I33 percent since I972,
causing a $2.8 million deficit in the

school's budget this year.

When the costs of room and
board, books and other expensesare
totaled, the average in-state medical
school student pays about $l4,000 a
year. 7 i "

“We would be willing to stipulate
that we‘d take in a higher percentage
of in-state students, if we could ‘see
our way out ofour financial difficul-  -
ties," Leon testified at the time. ‘

Despite the alleged deficiencies in

Looking For
Leadership

According to many theorists,all threats to happiness
can be pigeonholed into the following five categories:
war, caste, poverty, tyranny, and disease. As with most
theories, the broad nature of the terms used allows for
little practical application. lronically, Pitt’s Medical.
School has found pragmatic uses for at least two of
these terms—fighting disease is the purported purpose
behind the school; and a new word, poverty, has now
entered the Med School’s lexicon. The word “caste”
may soon follow.

Inflation, among other causes, has raised the tuition
for next year to $10,000. At this mind-boggling rate, a
student can spend over $40,000 in four years, not
counting books, supplies, living expenses, lab fees—or
inflation. Some estimates put tuition at $13,000 by
l984,only if there are no more cutbacks in federal and
state grants—an unlikely prospect. Also, many stu-
dents are forced to take out loans, often on top of
undergraduate bank debts. It requires a sophisticated '
calculator to add up the expenses (plus interest) that a
med student accumulates before even beginning
practice.

The situation breeds a disturbing prospect: by limit-
ing enrollment to those who can obtain a loan (a
dwindling number) or those whose families can afford
it, a caste system is created, where only the rich can
become doctors. This would not only dilute the quality
of students in medical school, but inflame the already
precarious relationship between physicians and the
public. ~

Locally, these monetary worries are compounded
by the.recent problems that the Pitt" Medical School
had with accreditation. The school is now on proba-
tion, which means that Pitt could lose all credentials if
the shortcomings are not corrected. The loss of the
only medical school in Western Pennsylvania would
be very damaging to the University as a whole, as well
as the area which it serves.

The implications of probation are not limited: a
highly-qualified student would have second thoughts
about coming here, thus threatening todilute the qual-
ity even more; and any improvements that the Med
School might need in order to upgrade might translate
into higher tuition—which could be the final straw for
many present and prospective students. ’

What is needed, then, even more than money or
grants, is a strongleadership and administration for
the school. An effective troubleshooter could contain
the probation problems before they blossom. it is not
an issue to be fought only by med students, but by the
entire University-—the reﬂexive tie between the repu-
tation of Pitt and the reputation of its individual
schools is inexorable. Bad news travels fast: we could
become known as The University That Lost lts Medi-
cal School, a name that even the finest football season
would never erase. *

Med Student Defends

Dear Editor:

This is a partial rebuttal to “Dr.
Robert Shaw’s” letter in the June
3rd Pitt News. I have just recently
completed two years of basic science
at Pitt Medical School, and l have
learned a tremendous amount in
that time. Some of what We learned
had to be self-taught because of poor
or inadequate teaching; however,
much of the basic medical science
that I know now reflects the efforts
of talented and interested faculty.

Medical students and faculty have

Getting
Terminology
Straight

Dear Editor:

In reference to the story on radia-
tion dangers in the front page of The
Pitt News of the May 20, l98l issue,
I would like to point out certain mis-
conceptions . of terminologies."
Firstly, there is no such thing as LET
radiation.‘ LET is the acronym for
linear energy transfer; and this refers
to the amount of energy deposited
by the directly ionized radiation
along its track in the medium. Radi-
ation can be classified as either low-
LET or high-LET radiation.
High-LET radiation deposits large
amounts of energy during its course

in the medium, while low-LET radi- -

ation low amounts of energy. Alpha
and neutron radiations are high-
LET radiation, while gamma rays
and x-rays are considered as low-
LET in‘ comparison. A

The term low-level radiation does
not necessarily imply low-LET radi-
ation. This term means that the dos-
age absorbed by the exposed
population is low irrespective of
whether the radiation is of a low-
LET type or a high-LET type.

Therefore, to make sense out of
the story with reference to the state-
ments about the survivors of Naga-
saki and Hiroshima blasts, I think
what the writer intended to report is
that the neutron (high-LET) compo-
nent of the radiation from the blasts
is not significant, and therefore, the
increase cancer incidence can be
attributed to the low-LET gamma
rays. ‘ .

Finally, 1 would like also to com-
ment on the opening statement of
the story which says, “Supported by
alarming studies on the dangers of
low-level radiation..." Such a state-
ment is certainly attention catching,
but is it intended also to cause alarm
among the readers? I believe it is
uncalled-for. Whether the riskfrom
low-level radiation has been overes-

timated or underestimated or rightly ‘

estimated, thefact remains that low-
level radiation induced cancer inci-
dence is verylow. l.n fact, as l have
learned in my course work, it is more
hazardous to remain single thanto
be exposed to low-level radiation
(Cohen and Lee. A Catalog of Risks,
A I978).

Sincerely.

Correction:

Dr. Robert Glew was the author

‘ School Deteriorating?” in the June 3
issue of The Pitt News, not Dr.
Robert Shaw, as was reported; .

the right and the obligation to
demand quality in medical educa-
tion. All too often, though, it is
impossible to get a consensus of
opinion onjust what a quality medi-

cal education is; for example, many
of my classmates seem satisfied with
the education they're getting at Pitt.

I believe there are glaring inadequa-_

cies at Pitt Medical School, but is
the situation really significantly bet-
ter at Harvard, or Johns Hopkins,
or at any of the other 42 schools
“better” than Pitt?

There are deadweights and per-
manent fixtures in departments in
all medical schools, as well as untal-
ented professors with “big names” at
some. lt’s too bad that the outrage
these individuals inspire has to over-
shadow the good efforts of those
faculty, members (including “Dr.
Shaw“) who make learning medical

science the enjoyable experience it.

should be rather than the drudgery it
all too often is. '

“Dr. Shaw” is justified in censur-
ing the administration at Pitt, which
is all too accepting of mediocrity in
faculty, and treats headstrong

School

department chairmen with complai-
sance. Deans who throw up their
hands and blame “politics” or “the
system" for many of Pitt's problems
should be taken to task; they are not
being the advocates of high stan-
dards at Pitt Medical School that
they are being paid to be.

But the main point is this: I think
“Dr. Shaw's" wholesale condemna-
tion of Pitt Medica_l_School, and his
gloom and doom language is unfair
and misleading. Moreover, it affects
his credibility, which is unfortunate,
since many of the points he makes
are so vitally important to Pitt Med-
ical School’s future wellbeing.

Sometimes medical school and
departmental administration can
seem as corrupt as party politics. But
to drag down everyone connected
with the medical school is to createa
false impression, and one that is ulti-
mately not constructive, as well as
being demoraliz_ing.

Why Did We Vote No? R

By MARK COLLINS

Occasionally, but not often, peo-
ple set themselves up for obvious
ridicule. .Betting on the Chicago
Cubs to pull out a World Series vic-
tory would be one; or to imagine
that the bank line will be shorter
next time around. It's partly a trait
of humaness—to openly demon-
strate that a college education is a
nice excuse for brain damage. _

Recently the World Health
Organization adopted regulations to
restrict the advertisement and mar-
keting of baby formulas to the Third.
World. The curbs were needed,
-advocates claimed, for these‘pri-
mary reasons: .

—the formulas, which are usually

‘powdered, must be mixed with

water. In many poor areas, clean

_water is unavailable, so contami-

nated water is unwittingly substi'—
tuted;

—when used properly, the formu- 
' las

are effectively nourishing-
however, in an effort to stretch the

‘ formula‘,”maiiy mothers add more '

water, thus reducing the child’s
nourishment; ‘ '

—the formulas are being substi-
tuted for breast-feeding, which is
more nourishing, and extended use
of a substitute causes the breasts to
lose much of their supply. _

These are only the physiologic
abuses-Newsweek has also
reported unethical business practi-
ces as well. These atrocities include:

employees of the formula companies ~

dressing in white smocks and tour-f
ing poorer areas, promoting the pro-
duct; and rumors of “hooking”
children on free samples. ,

In the face of this evidence, the

World Health Organization enacted ’
-the restrictions last week, by a vote

of I18-l. The lone dissenting vote
éamefrom the United States. -

The entire episode would be comi-
cal if the consequences weren’t so
terrible. Apparently the U.S.——

’ under pressure from baby formula

manufact_urers'—was set to submit
an embarrassing but non-commital

abstention on the vote, but the Rea- .

gan administration changed this to a-

._ solid. committed “no”. Why? Elliot

saying the ban “has grave constitu-
tional problems for us——we couldn’t
adopt it here at home, and we
couldn‘t recommend it for anyone
else." Mr. Abrams is correct in that
we probably couldn’t adopt it in this
country—at least not with the pres-
ent administration. But his state-
merit that a World Health
Organization resolution (akin to a
United Nations resolution) poses
“grave constitutional problems"

grants a power of law that these ‘

WHO decisions never had before. If
Mr. Abrams is contending that legis-
lation of advertising is somehow un-
American, we might see cigarette
commercials.return to radio and tel-
evision. V ' .
The White House reportedly
made the decision because it viewed
the restriction as an affront to free
speech and free trade. A commit-
ment to free trade might be evident
here—although it opens the door to

such “harmless” products as Lae-

trile.‘ But free speech? Under this rea-
soning, the truth in advertising laws
are also unconstitutional, and the
law ‘against yelling “fire!” in a
crowded theater may be the next to
go.

. lem as well. The United States must
have been aware of the odds in.lo_s-
ing. To abstain would have been

- spineless, but to vote “no” in the face

of I I8 “yes” votes took a lot of, um,
nerve. The "resolution now has the
same power it would have with the

abstention, or -passed by _a' simple n

tries like Chad or Zaire who is boss?

All the direction and production
in the world can’t save an actor who
forgets a line, or like l(en_ Bolden
gets stabbed inthe opening act——for
real. Bolden still has the scar and
remembers the blood, but the
audience figured it was just part of
the play. Facing the blade though
may be easier than facing the Bard.

“When you do Shakespeareyou
should be sweating,” said Jeannine
Auld, a colleague of Bolden’s in this
summer’s Shakespeare festival. “It's
the most challenging, but ultimately
the most exciting theatre. You make
a fool out of yourself, but once you
get it youifeel so satisfied, ” said
Auld.

Bolden, who plays Corin in As
You Like ltand Florizel in The Win-
ters Tale and Auld who is Hermoine
in the Winters Tale are among the
many local actors who have a unique

opportunity to work together in‘

Shakespeare ll. They welcome the

chance to play together, but readily

admit the Bard can be intimidating.
For Caryn R_9nis, a Pitt student,

who is Emilia in The Winters.Tale

and Audrey‘ in As You Like It, the
major difficulty is in ‘understanding
the lines. “l notice l want to race
through them and get them over
with,“ said Ronis.
“There is a double challenge in
Shakespeare,” according to Auld.
“You have to understand the mean-
ing of the play, then work on the
rhythm. His characters are so color-
ful and there is so much meaning to‘
be worked-out. Humanly and tech-
nically it‘s so beautiful,” said Auld.
_ “The festival tries to bring all the
talent of Pittsburgh under one roof,"
according to Carol Luke, an‘assist-

ant director of The_Co_mea'_v of
_ Errors. “It is a 'nicewa‘y‘.to

  
    

 g¢Isi0n;s,‘.tage,~

them in Pittsburgh for the summer,”
said Luke. - .

According to Luke, a smart actor

, listens to their director. “A lot ofthe

time the director is struggling too,

and give and take is necessary,” said ,

Luke.

Elaine Carlson, who is playing
Adriana in The Comedy of Errors
sees that give and take as essential

for the actors performance. “lf an .

actor isn’t comfortable it’s never
going to look right on stage,” said
Carlson. She stresses the need féj
the director and actor to discuss the/

role so that each can have. input into '

'its development.
Carlson is working with Gillette

A. Elvgren Jr., who directed her last ‘

year -in Hearts-aha’ Diamonds and
Betrayal. ~“A good working relation-
ship is important with a director.
The biggest difficulty is that you are
working with such a large cast when
you do Shakespeare,” said Carlson.
“Certain directors make you feel
comfortable,” said Auld. “When a

day at 5:00 and 7:00.

For Bolden and Ronis the days

Ellie iﬂirerttntt

In all the facets that go into the
three-play Shakespeare festival, per-
haps the most evident—and most
tejked about element—is the play’s
direction. Recently, two of the three
directors (Gillette Elvgren of
Comedy of Errors and Kathleen
George of A Winter's Tale) talked of
the difficulties in directing a Shakes-
peare play. i

“I think laughter is 'best," Gillette
Elvgren, Jr., has said,“when it deals
with a wide range of emotions.”This
philosophy works well _ with a

A Shakespeare play like The Comedy

of Errors, which Elvgren will direct.
I-“I chose it because I love comedy.
liiteach a course in comedy tech-
niques. It's funny, because ever since
I was a kid, I loved the silent films-
...(like) Buster Keaton—nobody‘s
funnier than those guys. lt‘s physical
comedy, and you've lost physical
comedy in the movies.”

Elvgren, assistant ‘professor in
Theatre Arts at Pitt, said he will
direct Comedy with this philosophy
in mind. If his slapstick approach to
the play offends Shakespeare buffs,
Elvgren counters that the “properiz-
ing" of Shakespeare is a misjudge-
ment of the author's original
intention. - ,

“When people say you should be a
purist, you shouldn’t take Shakes-

i "pggre out of_his period—well, (he)

wrote in totally different periods, in

totally different countries. People -.
.think that you should do it in Eli-

zabethean style,. and V I'm sure
Shakespeare wouldn't agree."
In keeping with that spirit,

Elvgren plans to recreate the style
clothes and culture of the play’s
setting—Ephesus.

“You usually think of Ephesus as
being on the coast of Turkey, (but)
they always give it a Greek feel, or
Elizabethean," Elvgren explains.
“...When you read the letters of Paul
teﬁhe Ephesians, (you find that) it is
a town of great,’ superstition, of
occult. It is a town with a tremen-'
dous amount of . witchcraft, and
that’s what the play talks about.”

_' In ,addit_io_n -top, .c:om_binin_g. witch-2,  A

craft and comedy, healso plans :1
third aspect—pathos. Like his heros
Keaton and Chaplin, Elvgren is
aware of the sympathetic element in
comedy. For example, Elvgren
explains “a character (in one scene)
is laughing, but he’s also crying.
That‘s the theme of the play. There's
pathos to it, there's a tremendous
amount of hilarity to it...”

If the bizarre and occult slapstick
version of Shakespeare ruffles some
feathers, Elvgren seems to think it’s
occupational hazard.

-“lt’s the kind of wild openess that
Shakespeare provides—he doesn’t
give any stage directions. And what

. you want to do is capture, any way

you can, the enthusiasim and excite-
ment of his language with your
action onstage.”

“'It‘s not awesome that it’s
Shakespeare—it's awesome that it’s ,
The Winter 's Tale,” Kathleen

George said recently.

George, a member of the Theatre
Arts Department faculty,_character-
ized the job of directing Winters
Tale as “spectacularly hard,” due to
the mixed nature of the play, the
quick scene changes, and the credi-
bility of the action.

“A Winter's Tale is a lot harder
than half the tragedies,” George
said. The play, a comedy with heavy
dramatic overtones, creates an
uncertain mood that George is try-
ing now, in rehersal, to define. “I

_dream about it every night," she

says.

“We have a king talking about
dashing the brain out of his child...
(and -the child is onstage at the 3
time,” George explains. “And the
king is someone that we’re supposed
to be quite sympathetic with again.
It's awful and vioIent—and a diffi-
cult moment, but not nearly as diffi-

cult as some others in the play...the
mixture of tone is very difficult.”

In addition to the unsure tone of
the play, there is a problem of credi-
bility. “At one point, a bear comes
onstage and chases a man off. Its
hard for modern audiences to
believe it.”

George said that quick scene
changes are essential to the play, and

_ hopes to cut time between scenesto 8

seconds. “No downstage entrances,
no props to take upstage. (There has
to be) tight little exits, and moving ‘
large pieces of scenery.—tables,
thrones, canopies” all under 8
seconds, George said.

Despite the physical obstacles and
the difficult nature of the mood, 1
George hopes to draw a _ broad
audience.“ The Winter's Tale is not
for everybody, but I’d like tdmaké it
for everybody. My goal is to make it
as accessible asgpossible,”

They take ordinary people and
transform them. They turn students
into sailors and jugglers, acrobats
and belly dancers. .But most of all,
they make‘ you believe what you're
seeing on stage is from adifferent
time and place. ’ ‘ _

‘ Production is as important a fac-
tor in determining the success of a
play as quality acting and directing.

director, and hair designer are

plays in the.Shakespeare festival.

Walker said the difficulty of their
jobs is compounded by the fact that
one of the_plays——7he Comedy of
Errors—will travel to Ligonier. For
Jager-Walker, this means construct-
ing a portable, folding set (“folds ﬂat
like a sandwich”) that can endure life
on the road.

Jager-Walker’s main concern is to
create “a giant jigsaw puzzle” of set‘
pieces created from designs and gra-
phics. In doing this, he works with
the set designer and the play’s direc-
tor to set up lighting and sound
effects, and to produce certain set
pieces (like stairs) so that they can be
moved quickly during scene

. changes.

Texas Rang

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Pitt News Sports Editor

One look, one photo and one con-
versation was all it took to convince
the Texas Rangers, who draft like
they scout, to select Pittjunior ﬁre-
ball pitcher Allen Lachowicz with
their No. I pick in Monday’s major
league free agent draft.

A phone call early Monday from a
newsman at Pittsburgh Pirate draft
headquarters via Pitt baseball coach
Bobby Lewis informed a surprised
Lachowicz that the Rangers ' had
made him their first round choice
and 27th selection overall in the
draft.

“Who?" said Lachowicz.

“The Rangers," Lewis repeated.

“I was surprised,” said‘Lacho-
wicz, who immediately went rifling
through the newspapers for some
quick information on h_is new team,
currently second in the American
League West. “I didn’t know much
about the Rangers. I only talked to
their scout once and he only
attended one game that I know of."
Apparently, the meeting wasn't par-
ticularly a monumental one either,
compared to other teams who
expressed a great deal of interest in

Lachowicz.

 

_   _
Carlton Neverson (above) went to the Golden State Warriors

yesterday in the third round, and Sam Clancy (below) was
taken third by the Phoenix Suns.

“He came up and talked to me
before the game, took a photograph
of me and coach Lewis and asked me
the same questions everyone else
does,” Lachowicz recalled. “He
wanted to know about my family
and how much I wanted to play
ball.”

Lachowicz says he wants to play
very much. The 6-3, I85-pound
righthander, who finished 7-3 for
Pitt with 1.40 ERA and 75 strikeouts
in just 64 innings (both sixth in the
NCAA), is anxious to talk to the
Rangers and to start playing again
soon, once the details of his contract
and minor league assignment are
worked out. The names ofthe Texas
farm clubs are just part of Lacho-
wicz’s crash course on the Rangers.

“At least I know where their
minor league , teams are now,”
Lachowicz joked. “Their triple ‘A’
club is in Wichita, Tulsa is their dou-
ble ‘A’ team, and somewhere in
North Carolina, they’ve got their
Class ‘A’ team.” ,

Notice Lachowicz isn’t checking
down the list any further. As a first
round selection, he has an excellent

chance of starting at the Class ‘A’

level, at least, or roughly half-way
up the ladder to the major leagues.

Neverson Drafted in Third;

ClancyFollows as Sun ’s N 0.3-

By MARK VEATER

Pitt News Sports Writer

Pitt’s “Bam” Clancy and Carlton
Neverson are going to the NBA after
both were picked in the third round
\of the collegiate draft yesterday.
‘Clancy was picked by the Phoenix
Suns and Carlton Neverson was
selected by the Golden State
Warriors.

Arnie Jacobs, agent for Clancy
and Neverson, was surprised that
Clancy wasn't-picked in the earlier
rounds of the draft. As for Never-
son, Coach Roy Chipman figured

 “he’d go in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th

round.”

Both Clancy and,Neverson realize
they have a long road ahead to make
it in the NBA. ‘

Clancy notes, “I’ll have to work
hard to get on the team,” but that “it
feels good to be picked to play."

Neverson said “it really hasn’t
sunk in yet on being picked by the
Warriors. I’ll know more about
everything in a few days.”

Neverson, a 6-5 guard, already
knows some of the requirements
needed to make a -pro team. The

Washington Bullets held a mini-
camp prior to the NBA draft which
Neverson was invited to attend.

“After being at the camp, I knew
what was to be expected from the
players in the NBA,” Neverson said.

Neverson said his role with
Golden State will be to add bench
support. '

‘‘In the NBA, you need to have
consistency and to be able to score at
any needed time.”

Before the draft, Neverson said he
had no idea of where he may go.

“I’m just pretty excited of getting
the chance to play in the pros,” Nev-
erson noted. “Coach Al Attles of the
Warriors just called to inform me
about being drafted and he told me I
would be getting some more calls
later on.”

Neverson recognizes that he needs ,
to improve on some of his abilities. "

“I need to cut down on turnovers
and to be able to score more effi-
ciently,” Neverson predicted. _

The Golden State Warriors need
to make improvements at the guard
position, so Neverson may be able to
crack ‘the rosterl (The NBA has
extended the players on a team from
I l to 12 playersfor the next season.)

Panthers Unveil Hoop

' BASKETBALL SCHEDULE

There’s no household names in
collegiate basketball like Maryland
included on this year's Pitt Panther
basketball schedule, but the list
includes a line-up of tough oppo-
nents that could test coach Roy
Chipman‘s team defending Eastern
8 championship and its chances of
bettering last year's I9- I 2 record and
trip to the NCAA tournament.

After opening the season
November 20 with an exhibition
game against the Australian
National team, the Panthers travel
to Alabama-Birmingham, the. often
underrated team headed by former

UCLA coach Gene Bartow, a disci-
ple of the legendary Jon Wooden.
Pitt will participate in December’s
Far West Classic, and lock up with.
some non-Eastem 8 foes that
include Cincinnati, Penn State,
Temple and Eastern Michigan.
League rivals Duquesne, Rutgers,
West Virginia and Rhode Island
meet Pitt in January, when the
Panthers enter the bulk of their
Eastern 8 schedule that climaxes
with the first round of the Eastern 8
tournament slated for March 2 this
year.
t The full I981-82 schedule is:
November: 20, Australian

National team; 28, at Alabama-

‘‘_I don’t know of the situation at
‘Golden State concerning the guards,
I hopejust to be able to contribute in
any way possible. Again, I feel
happyjust being given the chance to
play,” Neverson said.

The heart of the Pitt basketball
team for the last four years, Sam
Clancy, is going to the. Phoenix
Suns. Interestingly enough, Sun
assistant coach, John Wetzel com-
mented on Sam before the draft in
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that:
“We don’t consider him a second
round pick. He shows enough to
tease you, but I think he slipped a

little bit as a senior. He looks to me '

like he.doesn’t understand the game.
He’s always a little" late helping out
on the defense, and he’s a little out of
position.”

Wetzel’s thoughts of Clancy at
Phoenix will be tested now when
Clancy reports to the team’s camp.

Clancy will be used as a small
power forward and may get help
making the Sun’s roster if veteran

Truck Robinson is traded to the
Atlanta Hawks, as rumored, in the
next few days. Clancy’s optimistic of
his pro chances, but also noted that
“it’s extra hard to make avteam in the
pros.”

Lachowicz No.1 to Rangers

continued from page six

“He has the talent, desire and ded-
ication to ‘go all the way to the
majors,” said Lewis. “He has a
strong, fluid arm, good control, he’s
a very intelligent pitcher, and he’s a
hard worker.”

Lachowicz is the first baseball
player from Pitt to go in the first
round, and just the third Panther
player ever to be drafted—both
other players, pitcher George
Medich and third baseman Ken
Macha, are currently playing in the
majors. Still Lewis avoided taking
any of the credit for Lachowicz’s
success.

“At least I didn’t hold him back or
hurt him,” Lewis joked. “I’m just
glad all his hard work got
rewarded."

Lachowicz should get rewarded
nicely, thanks. The current going

rate for lower first-round free agent
selections is “about $40,000 on up to
around $60 or $70,000"according to
the Pirate’s assistant scouting direc-
tor Jon Neiderer. The top one or two
picks in the entire draft, Neiderer
said, can expect to sign for anywhere
from $l00—$250,000, with the exact
price depending on many factors,
including the club.

Lachowicz said he doesn’t antici-
pate any difficulties signing with the
Rangers. Aided by his parents and
possibly a lawyer he will retain as
counsel, Lachowicz said the family
will handle the contract
negotiations.

“I doubt l’ll get an agent," Lacho-
wicz explained. “We might get a law-
yer but just to give advice on the
contract terms. He’s not allowed to
actively negotiate.”

Lachowicz expected to talk with
the Rangers for -the first time last
night after missing their first call late
Monday evening while he was out.
But just the thought of going to
Texas has Lachowicz pleased.

“I’m real excited. I’m goingto stay
home tonight and wait for their
call,” he said. “I’m anxious to get
going.”

Lachowicz said he has no specific
timetable set for getting to the
majors before he’d consider another
line of work. Lachowicz said he
intends to return to Pitt to complete
his last year in industrial
engineering.

“There’s a lot of ‘ifs’ involved (in
baseball), so it all depends,” Lacho-
wicz said. “If my arm holds out,
maybe I’ll pitch ’til I’m 42."

That’s how much Lachowicz
wants to play.

SpOl‘tS Briefs: WVU investigates classes

WVU checking infrac-

tions. ..

West Virginia University is
reviewing the acadmic records ofits
athletes for alleged academic infrac-
tions, according to WVU’s Bill
Nugent, vice president for academic
affairs.

According to the Associated
Press, Nugent was quoted in last Fri-
day’s Charleston Daily Mail as say-
ing that two courses last year were
found to have a high number of stu-
dent athletes enrolled", many of
whom made ‘A’s in the classes which
have since been discontinued.

If the university determines in its
investigation that the student ath-
letes made ‘As in classes that did not
help them progress toward degrees,
it could be a violation of NCAA
rules. T

Nugent also conﬁrmed that the
inquiry discovered a case where a
star basketball player had a failing
grade changed to an ‘A’ two years
ago in a course called “Community
Health Education”.

 

A1 Haj     rc

Nugent said the investigation’s
findings will be handed over soon to
the state Board of Regents, and that
the NCAA might also be contacted.

The two classes in question were
“Workshop and Materials in
Health” and “Professionals in
Health Education”. They were
dropped because the health educa-
tion certiﬁcation progam at WVU
was being phased out, according to
Nugent, and not because of the
alleged infractions. '

Valenzuela, who felt he had a bet-

stayed on to pitch in his homeland.

Three years later the Dodgers out-
bid the New York Yankees (believe

The price: $120,000. And the rest is

unhappy with either the Panther
program or coach Roy Chipman.

“I was satisﬁed and happy with
everything concerning the basket-
ball team,” Brozovich explained in a
phone conversation Saturday. “I
had problems with the academics,
mainly because of all the traveling
and time it took being on the team. I
got behind real far in my classes and _
it was hard to make up all the work.”

Brozovich admitted that he has
visited the campus of Clarion State
College, where he is rumored to be
headed, but said he is also consider-
ing another school that has
expressed interest. He declined to
name the school.

“All I can say now is that another
coach is interested and I don't know
for sure where I’ll be going this fall,”
Brozovich said. “Call me back in a
month and I can tell you more."

Wherever he goes, Brozovich said
he will definitely resume his basket-
ball career after sitting out a manda-
tory year of playunder NCAA rules.

“I want to straighten out my aca- I

demics and go up there (to Clarion)
or another smaller school and get an
education,” Brozovich said.
Clarion recruitedv Brozovich
directly out of high school, but he
instead opted for Pitt and the full
scholarship then.-coach Tim Grgu- I
rich offered him, as well as the
chance to compete on the Division I a
Level. - *
