IIIINIIRARY IIIIMMERIIE
ERATERNITY FIIRMEII
AT UNIVERSITY

The national honorary commerce
fraternity, Beta Gamma Sigma, grant-
ed a charter last Saturday to a num-
ber ‘of commerce students of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. The students
petitioned the fraternity near the close
of the last school year. Inspection of
the local School of Commerce followed
and the petition was voted upon favor-
  , -V‘,  , ‘. .‘» -4, ’-. «. .

Beta Gamma Sigma was founded
from three local commerce fraternities
of the Universities of Washington, Illi-
nois and California on February 26,
1913. Its purpose was to furnish an
incentive and a reward for high
scholarship and a_ deep interest in the
deep problems arising for solution in
the business world. Election to this
honorary commercial fraternity is
based on high scholarship and the
prospect of growth, advancement and
sound business ability on part of
initiate.

There are seven active chapters at
the following universities: Wiscon-
sin, Illinois, California, Pennsylva-
nia, Columbia, Georgia and Washing-
ton. It has 500 alumni, active and
faculty members. Beta Gamma Sigma
is said to be called the Phi Beta Kappa
of Commerce.

The members of the Pitt chapter
are: Faculty, Montifort Jones and
Howard C. Kidd; graduate, G. L.
Schramm; students, J. B. Nicklas,’H.
C. Gow, Benjamin Jacobson, Harold
Burnsworth, Roland A. McPherson,
Charles E. Hastings, Frank Ferguson,
G. T. Selby. J. F. Jordan, W. A. Hel-
man, Lester Graham, J. R. Baldridge
and Stanley Malone.

llﬂlltﬁli DRIVE

“Pal” Moore announces that the
Canton Christian College Drive is well
under way, but that a detailed survey
of its progress at present is not pos-
sible, because the reports have not
been handed in from the dean's of-
ﬁces. It is hoped that the 1,800
shares will be sold by April 28, the
last day of the drive. Each share sells
for 50 cents, the proceeds being sent
to pay the salary of J. F. Karcher, a
former Pitt man, who is teaching
biology in the Canton Christian Col-
lege. China.

The ﬁrst shares were taken by the
Pitkin Club, to which Karcher be-
longed when he was a student. The
School of Pharmacy is the ﬁrst to go
over the top, taking all the shares as-
signed and making a. demand for more.
Shares are on sale at th‘e several
deans’ offices, as well as at the Y. M.
C. A. and Y. W. C. A, buildings, and
students are invited .to avail them-
selves of the privilege of buying
shares, rather than being forced to it.

A copy of the annual of the college.
similar to The Owl, has been sent by
the class of 1920 to the president of
the Senior class here. Its subject mat-
ter begins on the last page and con-

the modern day dancers, was ‘drawn

AIR -RACE

In a telegram received by-Louis
Dussere, President of the Aero Club
of the University of Pittsburgh,
from officers of the Intercollegiate
Flying Association, deﬁnite word
was given concerning the first ac-
tivity of the association, the inter-
collegiate air race which. will be
held from New York City, May 7
and 8.

The telegram states that Pitt will
be expect-ed to send four contest-
ants, who are to be ex-army pilots,
and are to hold reserve commissions
in the United States Army.

The Pitt Club has now completed
all arrangements to choose the con-
testants. There are more than four
pilots in the club who are eligible,
.so the records of each man have
been systematically compiled and
have,‘ been laid before the Athletic
Council for consideration. The rec-
ords contain such items as length
of time in the service, number of
hours spent in the air, types of ships
ﬂown, interest shown in the Aero
«Club here, etc. From these records
the men most ﬂ-ttted to represent
the University of Pittsburgh in the
newest of sports will be chosen.

The men who‘-are chosen to rep-
resent Pitt will probably «go to New
York ("on Monday or Tuesday next.
There they will be required to re-
port daily at the government ﬂying
ﬁeld at Mineola, Long Island, where
they will‘ be given ﬂights with gov-
ernment instructors to once more fa-
miliarize themselves with the “feel”
of the air The race will take place
on Friday and Saturday, and will be
from Mineola to Boston, and return
by way of Princeton, with six land-
ings en route Each landing will be
thirty minutes long, and the ship
making the total ﬂight of six hun-
dred miles in the least ﬂying time
will be declared winner of the race.

Pitt will face some of her adver-
saries in other branches of sports in
this new sport. Among the ten other
colleges which are to participate in
the race are Harvard, Yale, Prince-
ton, Columbia, Vvilliams, Cornell and
Lehigh. I

 Amusements

Rapid-ﬁre action and keenly amus-
ing comedy afe the principal proper-
ties of Wallace Reid's latest photo-
play, “Excuse My Dust," which will
top-line the program at Pittsburgh’s
New Million Dollar Grand all next
week, starting.Monday morning. It is
based on Byron Morgan's magazine
story, "The Bear Trap." a fast-moving
tale of the exploitation of a speeding
automobile. Its characters are the
sameas those in “The Roaring Road."
one of Reid’s previous offerings, but
its incidents, including a jazzy auto-
mobile race from Los Angeles to San
Francisco, are among the most thrill-
ing that have ever been put into pic-
tures. .

tenor from the Chicago Grand Opera,

 and the Mosconi Brothers, with their

day, April 26.

That matrimony is “the woman
game” in the same sense that busi-
ness is “the man game" and that a
woman may use any weapo‘n"in her

same as a man operating in Wall
Street. and carrying on any sort of.
business, is the theme in “The
Woman ‘Game? This is a novel
theme and has been handled in a
most -unusual way, making a photo-
drama lled with highly dramatic
moment and much_ real heart in-
terest. ’. ’

an Game" is a picture of the kind
that intelligent patrons of the screen

The story advances the theory that

C a woman-is entitled to pursue the is

same tactics, in her business—_—matri-
mony-—-as a, man isln his. ‘It is a
powerful story of life. A story of
truth-_.i'earlessly told, which can be
adapted. to any community. 4

 If students were to be prohibited fromcasting votes in the elec-

_fari‘se "a roar of protest that would shake the foundations of State

privilege of balloting because the habit of choosing one ’s own repre-

April 21, in Arts’ Hall, was featured
by a lecture on the “Chemistry of
Coal,” given by A. R. Powell, Ph, D.,
of the United States Bureau of Mines.
Dr. Powell discussed the‘ problems
that have arisen in connection with
the licomimercial production and utili-
zation of coal and coal gas, and,con-
sidered the various substitutes for
gasoline-—namely, alcohol, coal oils
and shale on. ” .

«. He showed how neither of these
sources of supply would satisfy future
demands, but predicted a good future
for oils formed by the distillation of
coal, anexample of which is “B-zol.”
This is likely. he said, because while

ply of the earth had been already doiie
away with,‘ only oneper cent of the
coal supply had been used.

Dr. Powell also discussed the forms
in which .-sulphur occurs in coal, and
the diﬂlcultles caused by’ its presence.
The problem of keeping sulphur out
of steel has been solved heretofore by
using. coke and iron ore of low'sul-
phur content, but the speaker showed
that the rising price of 2 coal would
coke. '

It“ was mentioned, in the course of
the address, the great advantages of
the destructive distillation of coal’ by
which coke, gas and tar are obtained.
This hecharacterized as much more
efficient and less wasteful than the old
method of burning raw. coal. The
chief obstacle tothe adoption of the
new method is the objection of house-
holders to burning", coke, which is.
however, according to Dr. Powell, only
slightly more diiilcult to manage than
soft coal, . e

“Confusion hath made its master-
piece--twlce." First, as Bill Shakes-
peare tells us, when King Duncan of
Scotland was founda dead man, by
the act of Lady Macbeth; secondly,
law went
into effect at the hour of 2 last Sunday
morning, by the act of Pa Pitt’s solons.
In line with all other law-abiding in-
stitutions, the University adopted the
change and promptly at 8:30 'last!Mon-
day, began to operate under the new
time schedule,

To the Pittite who makes his abode
in Schenlcy or Oakland, or» any part
or portio,,n‘of the conﬁnes and en-
virons of the “Steel City,” this new-
order of things‘ meant‘ little incon-
venience. He had but_ advance the
hands of his Ingersoljor wrist,-watch
one hour upon retiring Saturdayinight,
and, presto! the extra hour of day-
light was saved. —

Not so with the student who ‘hails

from distant parts or. near, and travels a’

back and forth daily. For, in most
 and boroughs outside of Pitts-
burgh, the old time is still in force,
and the change in time in Pittsburgh
proved to be highly bewildering to
these hapless commuters. '
Rising an hour earlier was not the
only one of the new difllculties con-
fronting the outslder. The transpor-

bhrrassing predicament for‘ the ‘itiner-
aht student, as he was beset by the
trying task of getting to school _on
time, without having to get up in the
wee hours of the morning to “make”
the early train. ‘

The situation is especiallyhard on
those who must use the Baltimore &
Ohio or the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie
railroad to get here. While the Penn-
sylvania Railroad had revised ‘its
schedule in conformity with the day-
light-saving ordinance, the other two
companieshave taken no such action.

The chances are, however, that the re-

mainder of Allegheny county will fall
in line ‘with a daylight ‘law of their

,\ own. Braddock haslalreadydone so.

Duquesne, Homestead , and McKee_s-
port are expected to follow suit. . .

_ Willy-nilly, Pitt students are putting
into practice ‘Ben Franklin's motto:
“Early to bed, and early to rise.” The
first day of operation of classes under
the ordinance, played havoc with the
attendance in some of the classes.
However, a. distinct improvement was
noted the following day, indicating
that Pittitesp are rapidly adjusting

1 themselves to the newconditions,

“If a boy goes to school until he
is 21 and then gets ‘married, the
chances are that he will never be
able to realize that all men are born
free and eq.ua1.”!

FACULTY REPEATS PLAY
AT KEIKZ KIIUSE

“An Experimental Home," the
faculty play written by Mrs. A. B.
Wright, was repeated Saturday, April
24, at the piano beneﬁt given at the
Heinz House by the Women's Activi-
ties Association.

The feminine roles were taken by
Reginald Johnson, Gustave Schramm
and James Reed, while the children
were represented by Mrs. Sage, Mrs.
McCandless, Mrs. McGough and Miss
Brooks.

Prof. Johnson portrayed a charming
young woman, captivating all except
the wily bachelor (Prof. Schramm),
who appreciated her unselﬂshness in
providing him with four children from
the orphan's home, but made a hasty
exit. The tall. handsome nurse, with
the Titian hair, also caused a few
thrills_ The children were particularly
ravishing, as well as being astonish-
ingly obedient_. Prof. Reed's imper-
sonation of Mrs. Young was excep-
tionally realistic.

The circus was equally successful.
The thriving family from the country
created quite a commotion and much
laughter. The stunts were original
and the dancing entertaining. The
clowns were tireless and their antics
amusing.

Refreshments were served later in
the evening and dancing completed the
program.

MANY ATTEND SENIIIR
llAK[lE LAST FRIDAY

The Seniors held their dance in thc
Schenley Hotel last Friday evening.
Freshmen deserted their Fresh frolic,
Sophomores gave up thoughts of re-
venge and Juniors»-—well,they just at-
tended, as a matter of course.

Including the Pitt alumni, fans and
boosters, about 150 couple were pres-
ent_

Novelty programs and ornamental
pencils were distributed during the
grand march, which began at 9 p. 11).
The event consisted of 20 dances.

It seemed for a. while that the dance
would consist of one dance, for the
orchestra repeatedly responded to
calls for encores.

HENHRIAN ANH HRUSS
FEATURE RUXINH SHHW

The Pitt boxing championships were
decided at Trees Gym last Wednes-
day and Thursday nights, when the
finals were completed. The bouts were
all clean and hard-fought. The big
feature of the tournament was the
work of Dutch Hendrian, who won a
decision over Anderson, the Fresh-

 

division. The two men fought ham-
mer-and-tongs all the way, but Dutch
handled himself in great style, and the
judges agreed in giving him the ver-
dict. _

Gross did great work in his two
bouts against boys who out—weighed
him considerably. He had entered in
the 135-pound class, but when the man
he was to meet on Vvednesday night
was unable to go on, Mickey took on
Kornfeld in the 145-pound division,
and won the decision. Thursday night
he beat Aubrey Schoﬁeld, who had
beaten Corbitt the previous night.
Gross made a great impression on the
spectators, and his victories were very
popular.

Ben Breman had a big edge over
Maggarrall in the 165-pound class, but
the latter was game and ﬁnished the
three rounds, although he was hardly
in condition to go the limit after the

That, no doubt, accounts for our

However, it is quite evident that the Pitt team has the stuff. As soon
as weather condltlonc give the boys an opportunity for some real work,
we are going to have a ball team comparable with any college nine in the

country. ‘

 

HOW ABOUT BOXING?
The boxing bouts at the Gym last Wednesday and Thursday night
showed beyond question that we have in school sufficient for a real boxing

team. Men like Breman, Nutt, Gross

and Hendrian, especially the two last

named, could make any college boxers of their class in the country step‘.
But whether or not Pitt will ever be represented by a team of glovemen

is another matter.

The big guns In athletics here have fears that boxing
is too likely to produce personal enmity and grudges.

This belief is hardly

shared by men who have been in touch: with boxing or by those who know
the conditions surrounding sports at Pitt_

At any rate it seems that a boxing tournament will be held here annually.

_' Eventually, we believe, a team for inter-collegiate bouts will be selectedi

And, moreover, boxing is going to become a regular feature of the work in

physical education.

The baseballers didn't do a whole lot of winning in Georgia, but they

did some tall sining on the way home.

Like all true artists, they chose

an appreciative audience--in fact, none other than John Philip Sousa. The
men sang for about a half hour before the eminent band master and it is said

he spoke well of their work.

Ben Breman has questioned Hend-
rian’s right to the heavy title, so that
if it is possible, a bout will be ar-
ranged between these two men in the
near future. Nutt, 135 pounds, won
from Harper, but since Gross can
make 135, it is likely that a Gross-Nutt

fllllll EAST LIBERTY cum

It is not all gloom in the Panther
camp this week. In spite of the fact
that the varsity was unable to come
home with a piece of the Georgia
bacon there is something that gives
sort of a victorious atmosphere about
the campus. What is it? The same
glad news we have been hearing all
year--the Freshmen won.

Those Cubs are there, that’s all.
They did it in football, cut up the
same tricks in basketball, and now
they are at it again. But it doesn’t
make us sore. They are responsible
for what sunlight there is on the
campus thus far.

The victory which they scored over
the well-balanced East_ Liberty club
was a. decisive one. The score was
11-6, and their opponents‘ scored two
of their runs on errors, too. Hend-
rian was the big gun for the yearlings.
But eight safe blows were registered
against him and he was pretty stingy
with the free passes to the cushions.
Holleran and Clawson both played a
snappy game also. Holleran, Cooper
and Fair each brought two tallies
across the crockery and each of the
other men scored once except Mc-
Cabe who failed to register.

 

The boys were there with the stick,
too. It was an , awful onslaught.
Twenty hits were recorded against the
two pitchers who were called upon to
lace the Pantherettes. This one fact
shows very plainly that Red Carlson
has a bunch of sluggers under his

care. The lineup:

Three Games in a Row.

During this week the Cubs will play
three games. Tomorrow they will
journey down to Crafton and cross
bats with the team representing the
high school of that town. The follow-
ing day they will go in the opposite
direction and tackle the Wilkinsburg
boys and Saturday they will hook up
with the third high school team in as
many days when they will face Manes-
sen High school.

Of course no prediction can be made
as to the outcome of these contests,
but this one game has shown that it
will take a well-balanced outﬂt'to put
one over on the Yearlings. As long
as they can stick together and play
the ball they displayed Saturday we
can expect that they will turn over a
very favorable record for the Univer-
sity annals.

val at Philadelphia on Friday and
Saturday.

The party will be in charge
Manager Gow, and will

of
include Di-

rector Miller and Graduate Manager

Davis, in addition to Coach Kerr and
the team. ‘

Coach Kerr's optimism was en-
hanced by the announcement from
Philadelphia that Pitt had drawn the
pole for, with Harry Martin, a fast
man running ﬁrst, the possibility of
starting the second runner oﬁ in the
lead is materially increased. .

If the second and third men keep
the team in the running _and get Frank
Shea, the anchor man, away with the
bunch the trophy and gold watches
will surely come to Pittsburgh.

The ﬁnal trials will be held this
afternoon at Trees Field. Shea and
Martin have already qualiﬁed, and the
other two men will be chosen today
from the limited number who sur-
vived Monday’s preliminaries. On the
basis of the trials it looks as though
the strongest candidates for the other
two positions are Weigel, Brickley,
Peters and Bovard. Had Capers be-
gun training a few weeks earlier he
would have had an excellent oppor-
tunity of making the team. Captain
“Red” Weigel has been the dark horse
in the trials and his increased speed
at the shorter distance has been a
surprise to even Coach Kerr.

Coach Kerr’s decision as to whether
Pitt will run in the sprint medley de-
pends largely upon the composition of
the team. Harry Martin will probably
run in the 440-yard hurdles.

tunate enough to make the Philadel-
phia trip will compete in The Press

For May 8 negotiations have again
been opened with Lafayette, and a
meet at Easton is practically assured.
The Eastonians have the strongest
track team in their history and are
particularly anxious to try for Pitt's
scalp this year. Their team is com-
posed of a limited number of stars and,
for this reason, they desire a two-
point system of scoring, instead of the
usual three points. If the meet is
deﬁnitely arranged the Freshmen will
meet Wilkinsburg High school on the
same day at Wilkinsburg. There is
now quite a large squad of Freshmen
working out, and a fair team can be
placed on the ﬁeld within the next few
weeks.

 Han alure and
‘ Fair Dealing

The main thing you want
to know about a tailor is
“does he know his business”
and “is he fair to his cus-
tomers.”

It is human nature to
want to be treated on a fair
and square basis. Satisfac-
tion means getting the best
»your money can buy——that
you are not spending waste-
fully or being hornswaggled.

Being handed a poor suit
of clothes is bad enough, but
the feeling that’ you have
had “something put over on
you” is a blamed sight worse.

My business instinct tells
me that the right way 15 the
only way.‘

That’s why I’m as par-
ticular about making good
clothes for you as you are
to have them.

If I please you, you’ll
come back with a smile. If
I displease you, good night.
