Proposes Tax Reforms

Shapp Urges IncomeT ax

by BILL GORMLEY
News Editor
Governor Milton Shapp
urged the State Legislature
Tuesday to enact a five per
cent income tax “to save

Pennsylvania from bankrupt-

Cy‘?!

Unless the Legislature passes
Shapp’s proposal or another tax
package during the next month,
the University will be forced to

rrowlmoniey to meet operating
expenses for the current fiscal
year.

Thus far, the Legislature has
appropriated only $18.9 million
of the $45 million requested by the
University. The sum is half of
what the Legislature appropri-
ated last year.

The State House is slated to be-
gin debate on the Governor's pro-
gram next week. The Senate can-
not consider appropriations meas-
uresuntil the House passes them.

Shapp, who pledged during his
campaign to veto an income tax
unaccompanied by tax reform,
called Tuesday for a “family ad-
justment credit” and exempting
commonly-consumed goods and
services from the six per cent
sales tax to “take some of the

 

     

burden off the average man and
give a greater share of the load to
those able to pay.”

If Shapp’s proposal is passed by
the Legislature without amend-
ment, theincome tax will be has-
ed on net federal taxable income
after deductions and exemptions

are taken into account. The Gov-
ernor’s advisers estimate that
four of ten Pennsylvania families
(presumably the poorest ones)
would pay no state income tax at
all.

With the Legislature’s approv-
al, the state’s corporate income
tax will. be reduced from '12 per
cent to 9.5 per cent—still the high-
est in the nation. Production ma-
chinery, however, would be sub-
ject to the state sales tax; it is
not today. »

Terming the alternative to the
speedy passage of new legislation
“financial chaos," Shapp empha-
sized in a televised message to
Pennsylvanians Tuesday that the
state’s schools, police services,
hospitals, welfare payments, and

environmental quality are at stake.

He stressed that 41 states have
an income tax, and termed it the
“fairest” tax and “the cheapest to
collect.”

Shapp also chastised schools for
indulging in alleged extravagance
by “building monuments to archi-
tects.” He said the General State
Authority, which authorizes
school construction projects, will
“suspend the issuance of new con-
tract for capital construction”
during the next two or three
months.

Job Outlook Optimistic

by CAROLE CO VAL

This year, the University Placement Of-
fice is registering more graduating seniors for
job interviews than in previous years.

Ernest S. Holmok, director of University
Placement, said that, especially this term,
“more students are aware of the present eco-
nomic situation.” The down-swing in job op-
portunities reflects the inflationary economy,
but Holmok is optimistic about the future job
market.

“Yes, things are bad,” he said, “but that doesn’t
mean it will never" improve.” In the meantime,
“the placement service will always offer as much
help as possible,” he added.

A variety of employers contact the University
Placement Service to recruit potential employees.
Besides big business and industry, many other
firms seek University of Pittsburgh graduates and
seniors as prospective employees. Insurance firms,
banks, depart:nent stores, and even a Johnstown
newspaper make interviews through the Placement
Center to meet future job holders.

     
 

There are various opportunities for jobs in the

social service arena. Both state and federal agen-

cies recruit employees on the basis of Civil Service
examinations that are administered by the Place-
ment Center.

Although the Placement Service will register
students for an interview at any time of the year,
the best for a student (who is graduating in April)
to apply is early in September or January. These
are the “prime recruiting seasons” for employers.
The “season” for April graduates is half over, but,
said Holmok, “It is never too late to register for

interviews. ”

In order to register, there is an initial fee of $1.50.
At any later date, a person may sign up for addition-
al interviews free of charge. The Placement Center
will also compile and make 30 resumes for a fee of
$1.50. A computerized evaluation of job interests is
also offered free of charge.

Last summer, even without the nearly 1,000
steel mill jobs that were offered the previous sum-
mer of 1969, the Placement Center was able to lo-
cate $3 million worth of part-time jobs.

“I suspect we’ll see the job market rise again
in the Fall of 1971,” Holmok stated optimistically.

Nader Blasts

Union Carbide:

by ELLEN GANLEY

Nader’s Raiders ride‘ again.
The newest offensive in the fight
for environmental protection is
war on Union Carbide (UC).

The University of Pittsburgh

it ranks fourth among collegiate

stock holders of UC with 10,200
shares.

Marc Hiller, coordinator of the
state and local Environmental
Action office, is working on the
Union Carbide problem at Pitt.
He stated that “UC is refusing to

 

NADER

obey federal laws. They seem to
feel that they are above and be-
yond the law.”

Nader is calling for a special
Senate sub-committee meeting,
under Senator Edmund Muskie,
to study the possibilities of strict-
er enforcement of federal regula-
tions as they apply to UC. “But,”
Hiller stated, “this isn’t enough.

Meager

We're asking Pitt to do one of
three things. One, sell the stock
they hold in any company that is
a known polluter. Two, at a meet-
ing of the general stockholders
of UC, we would like to see the
Pitt representative hand over
proxies to Nader or a Nader rep-
resentative to facilitate block vot-
ing. And lastly, Pitt’s Investment
Committee could at least register
a complaint with the company,
threatening to get rid of their

stock it corrective measures are- - 7‘

n’t taken.

David, M. Smith, treasurer of
the University, gave assurances
that the matter would be looked‘
into. He warned Hiller that “the
University cannot turn proxies
over to anyone,” but went on to
promise that he would “get the
complete details and write di-
rectly to the top people of the
company,
rants such action.”

Hiller countered this by asking
for a decision on whether the Uni-
versity would support the action
against UC, by Monday. He stated
that he is meeting with Nader on
Monday in Washington and would
like to tell him where the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh stands so that
action can be mapped out.

Smith stated that there is no
way a decision can be made by

Monday because a number of " *

members of the committee are
out of town and won’t be back un-
til the Investment Committee
meeting scheduled for next week.

Turnout a

At SA Inaugural

by POHLA SMITH

The inauguration of the new Stu-
dent Association (SA) commis-
sioners was delayed 15 minutes
Wednesday. The officers were
forced to wait until enough peo-
ple has assembled to warrant hav-
ing an official ceremony.

Approximately 30 people, in-
cluding the four commissioners,
the master of ceremonies and
three Pitt News reporters,
gathered to observe the inaugural
ceremonies.

Each commissioner pledged to
carry out the duties of his office
and gave a brief, informal inaug-
ural speech.

Wade Lawson, Committees
Commissioner, was upset at the
meager turnout.”

“I students are this apathetic
about their representatives,
we’re in for a trying year,” he
said. “I’m really appalled.”

Referring to the recent Pitt
News editorial that accused fel-
low officers of apathy and inac-
tion, Lawson asked the News to
ask “what the hell the students
are doing?” He added that admin-
istrators and trustees were also
guilty of apathy.

“I’m very disappointed,” he
complained. “We can’t represent

the students if they don’t want to
be represented. I hope this is
not some indication of the year

‘ahead of us.”

“This is just again another ex-
ample of the problem we face,”
said Dennis Concilla, Program-
ming Commissioner, also refer-
ring to the student disinterest.

“Only by affecting people per-
sonally can we get them to act,”
he said.

Lenny Klavonic, Social Com-
missioner, declared that he was
tired of waiting for the adminis-
tration to act on its promises.

“Let’s not wait,” he urged.
“It’s time to lock the door and say
we’re not leaving until something
is done.”

Ted Michalik, Academic» Com-
missioner, summed up the feeling
of his fellow commissioners:

“It seems apparent that Student
Government has lost the respect
of the students. We’re going to do
all we can to gain it.”

Robert Lederman, master of
ceremonies and newly-appointed

director of finance concluded the — 

program by challenging the com-
missioners for their negative at-
titude. He said that the commis-
sioners should go back to the “stu-
dents that they sought votes from.”

In the last five years, enroll-
ment has increased 62 percent
while the average level of fam-
ily income has dropped sub-
stantially—this having a “de-
mocratizing effect by providing
unprecedented educational op-

“An important additional bene-

Expressing his distaste for the
various “hard rock” groups pre-
valent at the University concerts,
outgoing president Paul Hensler
declared, “I don’t feel that the
commuters don’t necessarily en-
joy hard rock as much as the
rest of the University. Perhaps
it is time that the other tastes
in music were given a chance. ”

The possibility of a new loca-

tion for future student social
events was also discussed at the
meeting. Hensler explained, Con-
certs can be held in the Field
House as long as there was no
conflict with the athletic events
scheduled and the incurred

_ maintenance costs were paid.”

A new location for University
concerts, particularly the Field
House was mentioned by one
commuter due to its “Consider—
ably large seating areas,” and
its “relatively low upkeep fee.”

Scheduled next for the commut-
ers is a meeting on Monday at

event that no further construc-

  on VII: A Study of Life That No Longer Makes Senseeif

 

Boole Review

by ELLEN GANLEY
QB Vll by LEON URIS

“There comes a moment in the hum-
an experience when one’s life itself no
longer makes sense when it is directed
to the mutilation and murder of his fellow
man.” Adam Kelno, a Polish doctor in-
terred in a concentration camp during
World War II, was a man caught in such
amoment.

Kelno is one of the main characters of
Leon Uris new book QB VII. The doctor
served as a medical assistant to the Naz-
is in Jadwiga, a concentration camp lo-
cated in Poland. When Germany was de-

_ feated, he fled to'England and began

work in a clinic for Polish immigrants.

After only a few months in England,
the Polish government, now Communist.
accused him of conducting experiments in
mass sterilization while in Jadwiga. He
was eventually cleared of these charges
when the prosecution’s main witness fail-
ed to identify him as the man who had
castrated him.

Soon after being released, Kelno and
his wife fled to one of the far corners of
the United Kingdom, the Crown Colony
of Sarawak in Bornto, to serve as medical
missionaries. When they returned to Eng-
land after more than 15 years of service,
Kelno was knighted for his humanitar-
ian work. ‘

When it seemed that ‘everything was
finally going his way, Kelno‘s actions in
Jadwiga were again questioned. This
time, the accusations appeared in a book

   
   

 

written by an American Jew, Abe Cady.
Infamy

“Of all the concentration camps none .

was more infamous than Jadwiga. It
was here that SS Dr. Col. Adolph Voss
established an experimental center for
the purpose of creating methods of mass
sterilization, with the use of human guin-
ea pigs, and SS Dr. Colonel Otto Fien-
berg and his assistant carried on equal-

'T7‘

L

ly horrendous studies on prisoners. In
the notorious Barrack V a secret was
run by Dr. Kelno, who carried out fifteen
thousand or more experimental operations
without the use of anesthetic."

      
   

Thus began one of the greatest legal
battles in British history. Libel was the
charge and each man squared off with
two of the most respected barristers in
England.

When the court convened in Queens
Bench Courtroom VII QB VII, Abe
Cady’s case looked weak. The charges he

\‘«

had made in his book, The Holocaust,

~ were based on hearsay and there appear-

ed to be no way he could prove them».

Then an Israeli agent named Aroni,
one of the top Nazi catchers of the post
WWII period came to Cady’s aid. With
his help, a number of Jews from through-
out Europe and Israel were found to tes-
tify against Kelno.

But even with this evidence, the case
for the defense was not completely air-
tight. The one last link in the mystery
had yet to be found, This was Egon So-
botnik, who had served as medical re-
corder at Jadwiga and had vanished af-
ter the war. And with him the record of
the medical experiments that took place
in Barrack V.

Found

Aroni found him in Czechoslovakia. He
had taken the name Gustuv Tukla and
was a professional engineer in the Lenin
Factories. Aroni smuggled Sobotnik and
his family out of Czechoslovakia and
brought them to London as the trial was
drawing to a close.

Sobotnik’s testomony and the medical
ledger of Jadwiga brought the trial to a
dramatic end. It was clear that Adam
Kelno had indeed performed the mass
mutilations of Jews in the concentration
camp. '

And it was also apparent that he could
have refused to do these “experiments"
because other doctors at Jadwiga had
and were not physically abused because
of their descision. -

 g . --.  ~ W.

.‘:

There was only one small hole in Abe

Cady’s documentation. Kelno had used  I
anesthetic on his patients, although 'it.. i‘ 
was only a local anesthetic and.‘ the "
.“guinea pigs” were completely aware, of

what was being done to them.

The jury returned with a surprising’ 

verdict.

No, Adam Kelno was not a humani-
tarian. All of his post World War II hu-

manitarian actions had been motivated..n.‘g-'?«il‘+

out of fear that he would be caught. by

one of his former victims. At the novel’s”"

man.

It was Wednesday afternoon.

’ The Student Union Ballroom was

empty save for 30 people of whom
at least eight had to be there.

The four Student Association
elected officials, Wade Lawson,
Dennis Concilla, Lenny Klavonic
and Ted Michalik, each took the
podium and vowed their devotion
and services to the student popu-
lation of the University and then
looked out over the scant crowd
and decided that it would be to no
avail or only serve in the interests
of tradition to give their prepared
inaugural speeches.

You could see the stifled anger
and disappointment on each one of
theirfaces as they looked out on

The student tenants of 310 Mc-
Kee Place are really getting it to-
gether. After five months of occa-
sional cursory greetings in the hall
we have become well acquainted.
Our primary common denomina-
, tor is that we are all residents in

recognize the firm for its libelous
ads of “beautiful, plush apart-

Anyway, in the last 48 hours, we
prudent students at 310 have had

the many empty chairs of the
ballroom and then out into the
lobby of_the Student Union, which
in comparison was filled with stu-
dents shooting pool, in bull ses-
sions, listening to the juke box,
playing cards, or deep into some

. new novel.

AND THE few students who did
make the open Student Associa-
tion inauguration ceremonies,
worried that the seemingly in-
trinsic apathy in University of
Pittsbrugh students, might not
just cause the four Commision-
ers to say “fuck it” they don’t
need us, they don’t want us, we
aren’t— serving any useful purpose
in our roles.” But they didn’t

our studies interrupted twice by
a plague of blackouts. Our initial
reaction after the first blight of
darkness was to wander into the
hallway. I

“HI, I'M from ten.”
“Yeah? I’m from seven. Hi."
“Who are you?"

“I’m six.”
“WELL HE’s ten.
“Hi” . . . . . 

When the shadowy strangers
had introduced themselves, con-
versation drifted to the inade-

 

.7345?

And outside the ballroom, one
student queried, “Hey man,
what’s going on in the ballroom?
They got some kinda speaker in
or something?” And the other an-
swered, “Ahh . . . I don’t know
man, I think it’s got something to
do with the Student Government
president.” = ‘

And the original- questioner”
gives a disinterested “Oh” and
walked on. -

BACK IN the ballroom, the
commissioners sat silently until
each of their turns came to speak
and thought about the past election

month) living units.

NO ONE liked the idea that
they had to tape up all the win-
dows, sills, and floor boards to
keep out the freezing wind. (Be-
fore things were sealed, we had to
chip off icicles that formed on the
windows.)

Most of us were also displeased
with the tempermental radiators
that on occasion have leaked stag-
nant puddles on our plush carpet-
tiled floors.

Somehow these moments of

voted and they asked themselves
why they really had run.

They wondered why out of so
many thousands of students eli-
giblé, less than a thousand bother-
ed to spend five minutes of their
time to push a couple of buttons
for something which will affect
them as long as they are an under-
graduate.

And they realized that there
were still many students who did-
n’t even know that there wasno
longer a Student Government
president, but four commission-
ers and a new constitution.

spirits than when we left them. I
even woke up in a good mood des-
pite the wax on my sheets and the
suspicious smelling milk in the
refrigerator.

WHEN THE lights zonked out
the next night at 6, the entire can-
dle-bearing crew trooped into the
hall once again. The atmosphere
was jovial. Someone suggested a
seance and our buddies in number
eight offered a party at their
place (BYOC).

This newly founded camara-
derie was interrupted, however,

ing, the Student Association Com-
missioners are not going to give
up. They are not going to cop-out
and not try to get anything done by
using the rational, “Well the stu-
dents don’t care, so why should
I?”

They have expressed that they
realize that Student Government
over the years has taken on the
quality of “politics” and all the
negative connotations which go
along with that word and has thus-
ly, lost the respect of the student.

So they are setting out to win
your respect back.

HOW DO they plan to do this?
Simply by coming by coming to
you. They are not going to sit back
and wait for you ‘to voice com-
plaints, or come up to the third
floor of the Student Union where
their office is located and, tell
them, what you want—what stu-
dents need. They are coming to
you. They are going to try and
make you interested in the things
which affect the undergraduate
student at this University.

Judging from the past they have
a mammoth task ahead of them.
The record of Student Govern-
ment, heretofore, is enough
grounds alone to strongly consi-
der abolishing the whole thing.

‘But let’s say your commissioners

are going to give it one big effort.

Be receptive. The past Student
Government is dead. There is a
new name, a new consititution,
and a whole new set of leaders
with new ideas, in your interests.

THE PITT News will stay on
their backs, and also support
them when they are progressing,
and need it. Will you do it. Will you
do the same? Can’t you the under-
graduate at the University of
Pittsburgh,‘ forget Student Gov-

Damn right their going to make
mistakes. They’re going to some-
times get tired of all the hassles
and the inconsiderations. But if
they just, know that you are be-
hind them. If they just know that
for once students at the Universi-
ty are concerned with what they
do——if you will just give them a
chance, maybe student gover-
nance can again rise to legitimacy
on our campus.

THE PITT News will keep you
informed of the good and the not-
so-good, so you won’t be able to
say, “Well I didn’t know.” Ask
yourself, what do I want—-what do
I need at this University?

Support your Student Associa-
tion. It’s a way to get those things.

by the entrance of our tipsy care-
taker to the scene. One surly
neighbor opined that considering
the exorbitant rent, the walls
should be lined with gold if not
competent electricity. Enraged
by the jocund antagonism of the
group, our garrulous custodian

railed vociferously at his amused

audience.

“I don’t want any shit from you
goddam students. All you do is
cause trouble. Get the hell out of
the goddamned hall and go back to
your goddamned apartments.
Goddamn you.”

The smirking band of perse-
cuted tenants clinked candlesticks
and probed their way back to their
luxury apartments.

Florida Editor 'Repressed’ Chicanos Boycott SAGA

Dear Editor: The Pitt News;

As a past recipient of The Pitt
News, I have regarded your pa-
per as sage and subjective. I
write in hope that the repres-
sion of a publication elsewhere
might stimulate the students and
bring about a greater awareness
of their freedom.

Recently, several southern
school papers have been sub-
jected to the rigors of censor-
ship and censorship stipulations.
St. Petersburg Junior College
has been the most recent——mov-
ing further along the lines of
repression than in perhaps other
cases, but in a unique way.

I operated on the staff of the
SPJC Wooden Horse for approxi-
mately one year; first as an ad-
vertising manager, and later as
campus editor. As advertising
manager. I was required to pro-
cure $1350 worth of advertising
contracts. I procured $3200.

As campus editor, I introduc-
ed a new aesthetic format and
originated several columns that
ran consistently (which for Horse
was unusual). The editor-in-
chief resigned and I prepared
to fully develop the paper into
an informative, relevant, enter-
tainment publication.

I contacted faculty for their
own thoughts on certain contro-
versial topics. I began prepar-
ing features on stereo and tape
deck purchasing, maintenance,
and operational procedures (of
which many of us are negli-
gent).

I prepared to reprint The
Scranton Report on Campus Un-

rest, and run an interview with 
an abortionist (a follow-up fea— ‘

ture to Interview With a Push-
er). I also had planned inter-
views with the City Councilmen
and detailed coverage of the
upcoming city elections.

After my first paper, a regu-
lar publications board meeting
was held to determine staff po-
sitions. My faculty advisor dug

an actual student-to-student pa-
per. It looked as though I knew

fore I could decide on “Mary
Eats Beans In the Quad"
“Student Receives ‘A’
counting” to throw into next
week’s gossip sheet.

Surprisingly enough, even with
all my liberation, I was asked
to remain on the staff of the
Horse as campus editor — in or-
der to TRAIN the incoming edi-
tor-in-chief. (Have you ever
tried to explain what copy was?)

Evidently, I was too ambi-
tious and was, naturally, forsak-
en. I look forward to this fall,
when I might be able to work
on the staff of a paper, such as
yours, where quality is king.‘

Most sincerely,

Editor, The Pitt News

Pitt’s Chicano Student Move-
ment has been angered by what
appears to be the lack of policy
concerning the purchases of
non-farmworkers union lettuce
by the contractor of the Univer-
sity cafeteria Saga Food Serv-
ice.

The Chicano Student Move-
ment, an organization composed
of Mexican-American students
here is outraged at the general
disconcern expressed by both the
university officials and the stu-
dent body. This might partially
be due to the ignorance of the
circumstances surrounding the
plight of the National Farm-
workers and their struggle for
economic survival.

The farmworkers are the most
impoverished and exploited work-
ers in America. Conditions for
farmworkers are as brutal as
those of our industry before un-
ions.

Farmworkers receive no un-
employment insurance, no
health care, no old age pension.
The accident rate in the fields

is 300% higher than in other in-
dustries. The pay is barely sub-
sistence, less than 3,000 dollars
a year for a family of six.

The farmworkers are in the
midst of the most important lab-
or struggle in our country today.
When ten thousand lettuce work-
ers walk off their jobs last sum-
mer protesting inhuman working
conditions and the signing of
phoney contracts with company
unions, the strike was immedi-
ately scabbed by the growers.

Dozens of anti-strike and no-
picketing injunctions were hand-
ed down by pro-grower judges.
All because there are no laws
protecting farm labor strikes.

The presence of scab lettuce
in the University cafeterias sym-
bolizes the gross neglect by the
university to confront one of the
major issues facing American
society, thereby condoning the
economic oppression of our peo-
ple.

We, along with the Pittsburgh
Lettuce Boycott Committee, are
asking you, the students, for your
support. Through today, a table,
in the main lobby of the towers.
will be available for the sign-
ing of a petition to stop the pur-
chasing of scab lettuce by the
Saga Food Service.

lated literature, posters, buttons

Mark Payne states that he, him-

“It’s better for the team if It

don’t for a variety of reasons,

but it gets personal, and I don’t V

want to go into it.”

Coach Ronald Gray of F&M

“I think they’ll do better than
they anticipate,” Adams said af-
ter announcing the absences of

Both Bob Kuhn and ‘John Chat-

For a while in the second half,

The Mountaineers opened up a

Slowly, the Panthers staged

ginia basketball game Wednesday night Panther coach Buzz Ridl

With 2:49 remaining in the first half of the Pitt-West Vir- ‘

 

  
  

did a little more than the average coach does when he objects a

to a technical foul. Ridl ran into the stands.

Ridl didn’t want to fire up the Pitt student section—he says
he appreciates the present student support. The coach went into
the section to point to a student who threw an egg onto the court.

The egg-tossing resulted in a crucial technical foul charged
against Pitt because the home team is supposed tocontrol its
audience. And since no one else attempted to control the crowd,
Ridl tried his luck, which wasn’t very good. i

“I wasn’t sure,” Ridl said after the game in one of the most

, dreary locker room scenes at Fitzgerald Field House in years.

“lJ.'_hought I knew who it was, but when It got there everyone said
it wasn’t he-—so I didn’t have the right to say anything.”

The egg that precipitated the first of two killing technicals
against the Panthers was actually the second eggto hit court-
side. And before the egg, came a dead fish—which is an annual
occurance atthe WVU game—a firecracker and an orange.

After the earlier disruptions, Ridl walked only as far as the
scorers’ table to beg for an uninterrupted game. His plea to the
fans over the public address system is the usual warning offi-
cials give priorto inflicting the technicals. , .

Warnings didn’t help much and at the game’s end Athletic
Director Casimir Myslinski walked around the locker room
somewhat dazed, perhaps embarrassed. He paused for a very
long ten seconds-when asked to provide a reply to the fans’
develishment. ' ’

“I don’t know what you can do,” he said. “That first one
changed the whole movement of the game. . . . It’s just a couple
of dumb students.”

Pitt trailed West Virginia, 43-41, when the first technical
foul was called. The call came, oddly enough, as Pitt’s Buzzy
Harrison was approaching the foul stripe so the game was tied
at 43 when the Mountaineers were awarded the “technical. Wil

Robinson connected, and WVU pulled. out to a five point lead by 

halftime. In the second half the margin increased to 15 before
the Panthers repair their offense.

Coming on strong the Cats reduced the deficit to one point
(remember that first technical?), and WVU’s Robinson was
sent to the foul line for a one-and-one free throw possibility with
only seven seconds remaining in the game. The score was WVU
92, Pitt 91., B . 4

Before Robinson’s first pressure attempt from the charity
stripe, a secondfirecracker was heaved to the wrong end of the
court. Everyone expected a second technical that would have
given the victory to WVU, if converted, but officials Ed Plank
and Vince Jacob hesitated in making the call. Mountaineer coach
Sonny Moran became vocal, and as he argued with the refs an-
other fun—loving fan from the student section tossed a bagof
lettuce in the direction of Moran. The second technical was call-
ed against Pitt.

The thud of the bag of lettuce pu_t the Panthers out of the

game as Robinson sunk three straight foul shots, and the Moun-
taineers retained possession. Ridl agreed afterwards that the

thud also put an end to the slim hopes the Panthers held for a‘  ‘‘

bid to the National Invitational Tournament.

With the Eastern and national
championship meets (IC4A’s and
NCAA) a month away, the Pitt
track team travels again this
Saturday to the Baltimore Sun
Games in an attempt to qualify
more runners for these two top
meets.

Track coach Jim Banner has
had his athletes training all
year long on qualifying times
and hopes more will do so in
Baltimore. Banner, along with
the rest of his squad, now seems
to be anticipating the close-
ness of the events.

“I think”, prophosized Banner,
“the whole team is thinking
about them.”

Earlier this year, Banner ex-
plained that a ‘reputation’ had to
build up by the individual ath-
letes before they could be invit-

ed to meets such as the one this
weekend. Apparently word has
been getting around the achieve-
ments of his tracksters.

“Dorel Watley has been in-
vited to run the 440 in Balti-
more”, said Banner. “This is
the first time Dorel has been
invited. I’m anticipating. a
good performance from him.

Dave Szabat, due to his per-
formances so far this year, has
also been invited to run in the
mile race in the Games.

Along with Watley and Szbat,
Pitt’s usual stars will make the
trip. Smittie Brown will run in
the 600-yd, dash and with the
mile relay team.

Dennis Shatzman, Ted Bobby
and Watley round out the mile
relay team. It is hoped that the
team will find some competition
to run against in the meet. As

Mass Gymnasts
Visit At Trees

by STEVE WILLIAMS

“We will have our hands full”
commented gymnastic coach
Warren Neiger concerning
Saturday’s meet here with Massa-
chusetts.

“Tl‘1ey’ve got a pretty good
team and they are undefeated.”

One of the Massachusetts
gymnast to watch is Norman Vex-
ler. Vexler is an all-around per-
former who excells in two events,
horizontal bar and side horse. In
these two events there will be
an interesting confrontation for
two Pitt gymnasts, Mike Beatty
and Dan Campbell.

Mike Beatty is a senior who
works the sidehorse. He has
scored in the high eights already
this year. But he has hit a cold
streak lately and hasn’t scored
above seven points.

Vexler. scored nine points in
the last» meet against Navy on
the horse.

Neiger said,“Beatty is due for
a good weekend.”

Also Campbell, who works on
the Horizontal Bar is recuperat-
ing from a shoulder injury. The
injury will hamper his chances
of defeating Vexler, who scores
in the high eights.

Pitt’s Lowell Meek is return-
ing to competition this week
for the first time in three weeks.
He will be defending his un-
defeated string of four victories
against Bob Nelligan and An-
thony Vacca who both score
around 8.5.

Before his injury, Meek was
scoring in the low mines.

Frank Swift, who has been
showing control in his hand

stand and his routine, will face

Vexler and Dan Spier. Both
Vexler and Spier score in the
eights.

Neiger expects Jim Bilec to
make a comeback from his
trouble the fastfew meets.

On the ‘parallel bars Dave
Genest has been doing an out-
job for the Massa-
chusetts team. His score in the
nines will pit Pitt’s Dick Pribis
against his best foe to date.

Finally on the long horse
Albert Henry will bring an im-
pressive list of scores in the
nines against Dave Andrew,
who has scored nine points
only once this year.

Neiger stated the teams posi-
tion as the underdog, but he
did not cancel out the possibility

“We’ll be the underdog all

evidenced last week at the Pitt
Invitational, the relay team has
been running away from it’s. op-

’ position so far this year.

“It’s hard to run by yourself,”
noted Banner last week. “With

some good competition they
would do better.”
Pitt’s two-mile relay team

will also participate in the Sun
Games. Freshman Rick Weaver,
transfer Mike Schurko, Ken
Silay and John Aiken will do
the two-miling for the Banner-
men.

Aiken, who holds the Pitt Var- .. ~

sity record. in the 880, will also
represent Pitt in that event.
Jerry Richey, who has already
qualified for the nationals,
will also run for Pitt.

Another stiff test seems to be

Ranked W. C. State

Pitt’s women’s varsity basketball team takes on West Chester
State College, one of the nation’s top schools in women’s basketball, to-

morrow at Trees Hall.

West Chester is traditionally known for its winning teams. In 1969,
the undefeated West Chester team ranked first in the National Invita-
tlonals, and in 1970 (with a 9-1 season), West Chester ranked second.

Saturday will be the first meeting between the two teams. West

Chester plays other basketball
powerhouses such as Slippery
Rock, Glassboro of New Jersey,
and Lock Haven State College.

“lt’s a great opportunity to be
able to play a team like West
Chester,” said Pitt’s coach San-
dra Bullman. “We haven’t had
great competition, and it’s good
to play someone of this calibre.”

Coach Bullman plans to go with
the line-up used in the Kent State
game —— Elaine Kingas, Phyllis
Wojciechowski, Tana Casciola,
Rose Smith and Cathy Castle.
West Chester’s probable line-up
is Susan Benfield, Sandy Helt,
Linda Bensing, Phyllis Croney
and Mikki Baile.

Both the coach ‘and the team are
greatly anticipating the meeting

with West Chester. Says Coach
Bullman, “The girls are~really
very up for this game. They know
every shot has to.do their best
shot; everything must count.”

Swimmers In Md.   For

  Back-To-Back Meets

By JAN FRY

The swimming team will be
competing in the foreign waters
of American and Maryland Uni-
versities today and tomorrow dur-
ing their first trip of the season.

“I scheduled two meets back-
to-back in order to give the boys
the mental outlook needed to
prepare for the Easterns,” point-
ed out Pitt Coach Bill Grant. He
further explained the necessity
of this since swimmers of cham-
pionship calibre must be able to

endure competition for days at a
time.

“Last year the boys were drag-
ging on the third day at the Eas-
terns,” he remarked.

The Eagles (7-2), who swam
through such teams as Temple,
V.P.I., V.M.I., and West Ches-
ter, should provide an “even
Steven” meet, Grant maintains.

“The reason we put them on
the schedule (American U.) was
the comparison in times,” he

Theta Chi Scores lst
Cage Victory, 46-31

Theta Chi claimed their first victory in intramural basketball
competition, Wednesday night when they defeated Phi Delta Theta,

46-31, in the Trees Hall gym.

Phi Delta Theta took an early lead but Theta Chi tied the game
and then began to pull away to a 22-10 as the first half came to a

close.

The Phi Delts came within 8 points of Theta Chi (30-22), but
the outside shooting of Thomas and Nystom, combined with the re-
bounding of Larry Scola was too much for the Phi Delts. Tom Thom-
as was the high scorer in the contest with 16 points and Paul Zido

led the Phi Delts with 10.

‘Indiana, Pa.

Still reeling from the double
defeat last Friday to Clarion and
Washington and Jefferson Col-
leges, the Pitt shooters face front-
running Indiana University of
Pennsylvania tonight in an away
match.

Indiana is undefeated in the
Western Pennsylvania Rifle Con-
ference and defeated the Pitt
shooters earlier this year by the
lopsided score of 1320 to 1229.

If the Pitt shooters hope to
score a major upset they will have
to do significantly better than
their average of only 1240 as
I.U.P.’s team averages well into
the 1300’s. They along with Pitt
are the defending co—champs of
the 1969-1970 season but have all
but two shooters back from last
year’s squad, while the Pitt rifle
team only has four veterans re-
maining.

One of the reasons for I.U.P.’s
dominance of the conference is
the fact that it is the only school

in the league that offers scho-

larships.

Hour downed Panther House 35-
30 with Cleveland of Midnite

victory in a row by squeezing
past Pi Lamda Phi, 54-46. Kirs-
tein of Pi Lam led all scorers
with 22 points followed by
O’Keefe of Kappa Sig who fin-
ished with 16.

Delta Phi dropped a lopsided
decision to Phi Gamma Delta,
60-36 with Luft of Fiji taking
scoring honors with 22. Delta
Phi’s high scorer was Hecht
with 16.

ning effort.

explained. “If we make a mis-
take they’ll win and if they
make one we’ll win.”

The Eagles’ Brazilian Olympic
swimmer, Roberta Ve Sa, is out
with mononucleosis, and Coach
Joe Rogers describes his remain-
ing squad as ‘mediocre.’ “We
don’t have any hot rocks,” he em-
phasized. “You’ll win your first
meet of the season.”

However with the Maryland
Terps, the story is reversed.
Maryland, “A real powerhouse,"
as Grant puts it, will provide the
toughest competition of the
reason for the -mermen. They’ve
already splashed such teams as
East Carolina, North Carolina,
Princeton, and Navy raising
their season tally to 7-1.

Mary1and’s Gary Goodner, an
Atlantic Coast Conference champ,
leads the squad in freestyle. Jim
Clifford, another freestyler,
broke two pool records this sea-
son in the 500 and the 1000 yard
freestyle events.

“He’s a sub-five minute man
and will provide tough competi-
tion for Rickie Rowe, but I think

Rickie can handle him,” Grant
remarked.
Grant says the Maryland

squad is “a gracious team. We
may lose every event, but we’ll
be in every race. They won’t
pouritonus.”

Mountaineers, 90-65, I
IAS ,Martin Scores 31

By JERRY MYERS

Severely handicapped by the loss of their big 6-9 center, Bob
Hornstein, the West Virginia Little Mountaineers fell prey to a

sharp-shooting squad of Pitt Frosh Wednesday, as the Cubs won the V,

game easily, 90-65.

Hornstein, one of WVU’s brightest freshman prospects, broke
his collar bone at practice on Tuesday and was, of course, sidelined
for the Pitt game. Bill Swartzman, the Cubs big 6-8 center, took ad-
vantage of the height difference and continually went to the hoop.

Swartzman finished the game
with 13 points.

Micke Martin, canned 31 to
lead both squads in scoring.

Martin’s baskets came mostly.

from close—up. He connected on
11 shots from the field and 9-of-
10 from the charity stripe. John
Vidovitch, (25 points) the Little
Mountaineers’ top scorer drove
for ten big baskets, while con-
verting 5-of-6, from the foul‘ line.

With it all, Cub Coach Tim
Grgurich was not pleased with
his team’s performance.

“We struggled at times,” said
Grgurich. “We did a real good
job on their outside shooting, but
our offense sputtered in the sec-
ond half. According to the state
we had six‘ turnovers in the first
half and 13 in the second.”

The game never appeared in
doubt for the Cubs, as they open-
ed up at 11 point lead midway

through the first half. The mo-
mentum kept mounting, and with
some key baskets by Gary Pa-
gano (who finished the con-
test with 20 points) the Frosh took
a 40-23 lead into the locker-room
at halftime.

“We were trying to go to
Swartzman a little more,” com-
mented Grgurich. “They lost their
big kid yesterday at practice.”

The second half stayed pretty
even, with the Cub lead shifting
from 15 to 20 points. ‘Paul Vid-
