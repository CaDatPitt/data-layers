Graduate Students Opt

« For Unionization, SUGE  

By BETSY NORMAN

Pitt’ graduate employes voted
overwhelmingly in favor of unioni-
zation and picked the Union of
Graduate Employes (UGE) to
represent them in collective (bar-
gaining in the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences-Graduate Student Organ-
ization (FAS-GSO) sponsored mock
unionization election Thursday.

With 366 people voting.out of a
possible 800 to 909 eligible voters,
80 percent (292) voted in favor of
unionization. Out of those 292, 263'
voted for UGE as their choice, with
other groups getting 21 votes.
Eight people did not state a
preference. The other organiza-
tions pulling votes included AFL-
CIO (1), Pitt Professional Union
(PPU) (1), American Association of
University Professors (1) and
FAS-GSO (1).

The UGE leaders, who were
present at the counting‘ of the
ballots that took place in Alumni
Hall last night, were pleased with
the results.

“The Graduate Employes have
voted,” Bob Nelson, a member of
UGE said on behalf of the UGE.
“They have voted overwhelmingly
in favor of unionization and have
voted overwhelminglyfor UGE to
be their collective bargaining
agent. We thank FAS-GSO for
working so hard to overcome many
obstacles and for conducting a fair
and impartial election. We thank
our many supporters who placed
their conﬁdence in unionization
with UGE. We pledge to double
our efforts to better the conditions
of graduate employes at the
University.

“We open our arms to our few
opponents and call on them, in
light of the results, to reassess
their position and ask that we begin
work together so that collective
bargaining can help us all.”

Nyden, with Professor Yuset Ali (right) ‘confronts
. Chancellor Posvar’s assistant secretary. John Ouatroche.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar said at
a University Senate meeting
yesterday, “Teaching Fellows and
Teaching Assistants are legally
deﬁned as full-time students. Until
that is changed, we will continue to
operate‘ under the current TA and
TF system.” L

Dr.
secretary to the Chancellor, said on
behalf of the office of the
Chancellor, “The election was a
mock election, not directed by or
under the jurisdiction of the
Pennsylvania, Labor Relations
Board. Therefore, the election
itself has no legal base and the
results are not legally binding.
TA’s and TF’s are not classiﬁed as

employes for the purposes of '

collective bargaining under Public
Act 195, and, therefore, consistent
with public law, the University
considers them (TA’s and TF’s) as
being foremost students enrolled
for academic study for the pursuit
of an advanced degree of which
teaching assistance is part of their
preparation. ’ ’

Mr. William Hannan, director of
‘legal services andthe University’s
labor relations counsel said,
“There is nothing to comment on.

Nyden, Ali Rally

Injunction Chas

By MREA CSORBA

Sixty students demanded the re-
hiring of assistant professors Paul
Nyden and Yussef Ali Wednesday
while occupying the ofﬁces of
Chancellor Wesley Posvar and
Jerome Rosenberg, dean“ of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

With sociology professor Nyden
and black studies faculty member
Ali accompanying them, the
students demanded either rein-
statement or concrete reasons for
the professors’ dismissal effective
April 30, 1977.

The students cleared Posvar’s

' ofﬁce after three hours on order of

a court injunction presented by Pitt
Campus Police. They had spent an
hour in Rosenberg’s office earlier.

The two University ofﬁcials were
ata meeting (scheduled a month
earlier) with the school’s academic
deans in Monroeville. "The ralliers
were met in Rosenberg’s ofﬁce by
Reid Reading, assistant to the

Dean, who said he was prepared 7

“to listenand take notes.” At the
Chancellor’s ofﬁce, assistant secre-
tary of the Chancellor, John
Quatroche, said he represented the
Chancellor but could not speak for
him.

By DEANNA LOUISE

John Della Vella was elected
President of the School of General
Studies (SGS) Cabinet Council by a
four-vote margin Wednesday.

With approximately 6 percent of
the SGS student body voting, Della
Vella edged fellow Cabinet member
Bill Bair 177 to 173. .

from the past several years.

Stealing the four council seats, ’

order of vote totals, were Kathy
Gubala (211), Mary Synan Pollick,

,0 (151), Bob Hilinski (133) and Jackie

Woulitich (95). Ellen Harrison
garnered 90 votes in the race. S

Education major Della Vella said,

job this semester, only attending

He is SGS representative to the
University Senate and serves on the
Athletic Committee and Organiza-
tion and Procedures Committee of
that body. Della Vella has one
year’s experience in student
government, having been ap-
pointed to ﬁll the cabinet position
vacated by Patty Thompson_

Upon assuming office April 5,
Della Vella said he hopes to
investigate the possibility of
instituting for full-time SGS stu-
dents the $16-per-year health fee
option, presently available to
part-time students.

An opinion survey administered
at the SGS polling centers this week
attempted to determine if full-time

SGS students did indeed desire the

health fee option. ,
When the mandatory health fee

was imposed on full-time under-
graduates last fall, according to
Della Vella, SGS full-time students
were exempted because it was
assumed that many SGS students
work and have Blue Cross health

insurance at their place of
employment.
"‘A survey taken last year

indicated students did not want the

said. “But this year about 20

Tempers flaired between official

demanded Rosenberg and the
Chancellor be called from the

“It’s a matter of priorities,”

Nathan Gadsden, a representative
from Commonwealth Association of
Students, said. .“If the cases of
Paul Nyden and Yussef Ali are not
dealt with internally, then it shall

be dealt with externally.”

According to Chancellor. Wesley
Posvar, the University spent
$300,000 ﬁghting the Sharon
Johnson sex discrimination case,
not the $100,000 he reported to
the House Appropriations. Com-

Chancellor Wesley Posvar apol-

He said the $100,000 ﬁgure,

good faith and “speculations
asserting as much as $1 million was
spent are false."

Rosenberg said he will not see
Nyden if the professor was only

Rosenberg said. He said he won’t

Another CAS advisor was also in

HUME. Mo. (AP)——Kenneth
Hightower. the high school princi-
pal who gave two pupils the choice
of paddlings or eating cigarettes,
announced Thursday he will give
up his job and turn to farming at
the end of the school year in May.

Two teen-age boys became
violently ill after eating nine
cigarettes apiece rather than be
paddled for violating a rule against
taking tobacco into Hume High
SchooL

The American Civil Liberties
Union has said it plans to ﬁle a
damage suit on behalf of the boys,
with the possibility that Hightower
could be a defendant.

The school board backed him up
when mothers of the two boys

‘ sought his removal for enforcing

the tobacco rule. .

THE FAUCET’S RUN DRY

HARRISBURG (AP)—The free
ride is over for hundreds of
thousands of Pennsylvanians who
haven’t been paying their utility
bills.

Beginning March 31, gas and

electric companies once again will
be allowed to terminate service to
customers with delinquent bills, the
state Public Utility Commission
ruled Thursday.

But the companies ﬁrst must:

-Tell the customer in writing to
contact the utility within 30 days to
arrange for some kind of payment.

-Makeipersonal contact with the
customer at least three days before
cutting off service.

Those provisions were first
implemented last October and were
modiﬁed during severe cold weath-
er spells.

After March 31, if the customer
feels he is being.treated unfairly by
the utility when he tries to arrange
payments, he can take his case to
the PUC.

‘ ADVERTISING TAX PUSHED
THROUGH SENATE
COMMITTEE

HARRISBURG (AP)--Senate
Majority Leader Thomas Nolan has

successfully pushed his proposal for

a six pecent tax on advertising to the
Senateﬁoor despite the opposition
of a young Senate committee
chairman.

The proposal was approved
yesterday by the Senate State
Government Committee, headed by
a Nolan ally, Sen. Joseph Smith of
Philadelphia.

Initially, the bill had gone to the
Local Government Committee,
headed by freshman Sen. H. Craig
Lewis of Philadelphia and Mont-
gomery County.

“I sent him a letter that I saw
three constitutional deficiencies,”
Lewis said Tuesday.

“I told him I saw no reason to use

the energy and resources of the‘

committee when the bill was
patently unconstitutional on its
face.”

Lewis said the constitution says
revenue bills must originate in the
House.

Also, a bill can’t tackle two
issues, the constitution says.

The Nolan bill would levy the tax
and set up a reimbursement system
solocal governments could lower
property taxes for the elderly.

And, Lewis said, the constitution
says tax breaks can be extended
only to those elderly persons who
show a need. The Nolan bill would
beneﬁt all persons over 65.

Townhouses lrritate

Resident Groups

By DAN ROSENTHAL

Opposition from Oakland citizen
groups is expected next week when
a plan for 20 four-person town-
houses is presented to the
Pittsburgh City Planning Commis-
sion for consideration as additional
University housing, according to
Jay Roling, assistant vice chancel-
lor of public affairs.

The plan calls for construction of
ﬁve buildings, two stories each, to
be constructed on existing Univer-
sity property that is now a parking
lot on Bates Street between
Oakland Avenue and Bouquet
Street.

The townhouses, which would
house 30 students and include 25
on-side parking spaces, are part of
Pitt’s effort to ﬁll an “unmet
undergraduate need for housing,"
according»to Joseph Dutton, vice
chancellor of business and ﬁ-
nancef’

“We are artiﬁcially supressing a
large demand for housing at Pitt,”
Dutton said, “and this plan would
allow us to add a new, quality
dimension to our present hous-
mg."

Joe Farrell, staff assistant for
People’s Oakland, one group
opposing the plan, claims Pitt is
violating commitments ithas made
to the Oakland community.

“An agreement was made in
1971," Farrell said, “between the
University and Oakland Directions,
Inc. (ODI), that until speciﬁc,
long-term plans were drawn up for
Pitt's expansion, construction was
not to expand further into the
residential area.”

Roling claims Pitt has owned the
Bates Street property since 1969
and “the agreement has always
been interpreted to include acad-
emic facilities only. The agreement
we are still honoring simply doesn’t
apply to housing.”

“We take that agreement,”
Farrell said, “to mean all Univer-
sity buildings. Townhouses would
be just as much part of the physical
make up of the University as any
other building.”

He also said he feels more input
should be considered by people
affected by the proposed town-
houses before the plan goes to the
planning commission.

“A plan of this nature has
potential to seriously change the
living patterns of the residents in
the area,” Farrell said. “There is
already congestion there. Parking

'is a problem, too. Pitt seems to be

springing this on the Oakland
community with no regard for the

- residents’ interests.”

“Others interests
taken into consideration," Roling
said. “It's true some 230 parking
spaces will be eliminated, but
about 480 will open soon under the
new professional quadrangle.”

‘ People’s Oakland feels a lack of
adequate parking facilities for the
rest of the University's facilities
violates existing zoning laws. The
space made available when the
quadrangle lot opens will still fall
short of the need, Farrell said.

‘.‘Bates Street residents still have
much to gain,” Dutton claims.
“This would be the ﬁrst new
housing in that area in some 60
years. That's bound to .increase
property values of the whole area.

“But then there are those who
think Pitt is striving to take over
Oakland. They tend to speak out
against us just because we are who
we are,” Dutton said.

IA recent University study,
predicting a decline in enrollment,
was a factor Farrell claims the
University did not consider.

“So what they are dealing with,”
he said, “is a short-term housing
problem. Sure, the need might be

great now, but in light of the study ‘

showing a decrease in enrollment
and all the talk about minimal
funding from the state legislature,
it seems there would be much
better economic outlets for the
money than trying to build new
facilities, regardless of what they
are.” I 9’

One of the advantages of the
townhouse motif, Roling said, is
their flexibility.

“If at any time we find
enrollment such that we don't need
the townhouse space, there is no
reason it couldn't be rented to the
general public. For that matter,”
Roling said. “we could sell any

number of whole buildings if the ~

situation warranted."

ODI voted 9-8 with two absten-
tions to oppose Pitt's plan for the
Bates Street structures. Farrell
said there will be “plenty of
opposition to make their point felt"
at the March 29 hearing.

At that time, Pitt will present
the plan to the City Planning
Commission, ask for variances to
several zoning laws and hear
opposition from concerned parties.

The Effort is Needed

The Student Government’s External Affairs Committee’s (EAC)
lobbying efforts to reduce the drinking age is a commendable
effort, for it, as the saying goes, kills two birds with one stone.

A student lobbying effort, represented on the state level is needed
along with an effort to reduce the drinking age in the state.

The arguments for lowering the drinking age are all academic

and have been repreated often.

— Twenty-one is an arbitrary age to mark the time when someone is
responsible enough to handle the affects of demon rum. One finds

many on both sides of this age who should not drink intoxicating

. beverages. However, there are enough below age 21 responsible

enough tohandle this privilege to warrant a lower drinking age.

Whether this effort is successful or not, it provides EAC with a
chance to flex its muscles and investigate its own potential.

This lobbying to reduce drinking age can set up a bureaucracy
whose energies can be directed towards lobbying for or against
other legislation concerning Pennsylvania college students.

Money for higher education, employment and tax benefits are a
few of the student-oriented subjects 3 that regularly face the

state legislature.

A directed, statewide student effort would

increase the chance of passing bills in the interest of students.

A lowered drinking age is not as important or as urgent a topic as
money for higher education or employment. But thatis no reason
to criticize the newly-formed EAC. This is the first effort it has
tackled and it will provide an excellent chance for the committee to

make the mistakes novices make.

They can then turn, as

professionals, to fight for things like more money for higher

education.

ACLU—Crusaders Gone Sour  

By DAN MULHOLLAND

Since the inception of the
Republic, the proper construction of
the Constitution has frequently
been the topic of responsible and
lively debate. Unfortunately, this

ongoing discussion has turned sour

in recent years as certain self-styled
crusaders within the legal profes-

sion have twisted the true meaning

of that sacred document beyond
recognition, so that nowit is used as
a shield by those who would deprive
us of our liberties and even our
lives. Foremost among these
groups is the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU). Far from
being the defender of the Bill of
Rights it claims to be, its work is
often in direct opposition to the
American way of life, as this article
will attempt to demonstrate:

A brief outline of the history of
the organization and its goals is in
order at this juncture. ACLU was
founded in 1919 by Roger Baldwin
among others. Baldwin, who made
the ACLU what it is today, had a
long history of subversive activities

and was actually jailed for
anti-American rabble rousing dur-
ing World War I. ‘In 1935, he made
the following statement: “I am for
socialism, disarmament and ulti-
mately abolishing the state itself. I
seek the social ownership of
property and sole control of those
who produce wealth. Communism
is the goal.” Apparently, the «
powers that be were listening, for
in that same year an ofﬁcial Navy
Intelligence report in the Congres-
sional Record of September 10
stated: “A.C.L.U.: This organiza-
tion is too well-known to need
description. The larger part of its
work does undoubtedly materially
aid Communist objectives.” And,
in 1943, the California Fact Finding
Committee on Un-American activi-
ties concluded: “The ACLU may
deﬁnitely be classed as a Commu-
nist front. . .At least 90 percent of its
efforts are expended on behalf of
Communists who come into conflict
with the law.”

a result ACLU’s membership fell.

But toward the late ’60s, after the
Warren Court had adopted many of
its positions, ACLU began to come
out into the open again. Its.radical
nature has not changed, however,
and in many respects its operatives

are more brazen than ever. A recent ,

article by Franklin V. York entitled
“The ACLU Con Game” outlines
some of its recent activities:
“...abolishing the internal security
laws, prohibiting capital punish-
ment, legalizing abortion, destroy-
ing anti-obscenity laws, defending
ﬂag burning, sueing school officials
for permitting the display of nativity
scenes at Christmas and prohibiting
children from praying at school.”
ACLU was also active in the recent
attempt in Massachusetts to ban

.guns, which curiously enough is

contrary to the Second Amendment,
part of the Bill of Rights it claims to
protect. Moreover, the anti-reli-
gious rhetoric which it has spewed
forth in conjunction with the
abortion and school prayer issues
makes one wonder if ACLU has ever
heard of the First Amendment,
which is supposed to guarantee
freedom of religion. And, if you
should ever stop to reﬂect on why
we are no longer free to walk the
streets in safety, you can thank
ACLU whose revolving door
concept of justice has allowed

thousands of dangerous felons to go I

free, only to commit their nefarious
acts again and again.

ACLU has been rather active on
the Pitt campus in recent months
and just this term it announced the
formation of a “civil liberties
coalition" with various other left
wing groups at the law school.
Among the more prominent organi-

zations in this union is the National.

Lawyers Guild. This outfit was
ofﬁcially cited by Attorney General
Tom Clark as “the foremost legai
bulwark of the Communist Party in
the United States." The coalition
has, of course, involved itself in a

reported to the desk on one day.
The worst days were Thursdays
through Sundays. 7

Because I wasn't that careless, I
didn’t feel too much like a chump,
but what did bother me. is that I
wasn't forewarned in any way that
thefts were a problem in that
building. (Who would think it?
Everybody looks so industrious in
the library.) Judging from the
number of victims last year,
however, a lot of people were made
aware the hard way.

A couple weeks ago I walked
around the library looking for signs
warning against theft. I found only
two and they were -stashed back
within the aisles of the stacks in
placesthat people are not likely to
pass. The logical place to put
them, of course, is at the doors and
checkout desks, where people can
see them as soon as they enter the
library.

Unlike other University build-
ings, Hillman is a semi—public
facility that anyone can use, which
means the thieves could be
non-University people. For that
reason. posting signs and publiciz-
ing the problem need not be a bad
reflection on the University itself.
On the contrary, it ‘would be doing
a service for students who scrape
up the $600 plus every semester to
pay tuition.

The blame for the high.number
of thefts really can’t be placed with
the ofﬁcers who patrol Hillman.
With only one man on duty, it’s
difﬁcult to cover ﬁve floors at all
times. Anyone with half a wit
woudn’t steal in front of a blue
uniform, so the officer is rarely
“right there" when the rip-offs

occur. His role is reduced,
therefore, to action after the thefts
take place.

Last week I voiced my complaints
to Officer Don Green, who
regularly patrols Hillman, and he
added a couple of his own. For one
thing, he said people who leave
their purses or wallets on the tables
and walk away are prime targets
for thieves. By the time the victim
notices something is missing, it's
often‘ too late—-the thief has had
time to root through the purse and
ditch it in a trash can or in the
stacks somewhere.

Green said the red emergency
phones in the hallways of the third
and fourth ﬂoors and in the
elevators are there so victims can
call the checkout desk without
having to go all the way
downstairs. (All you have to do is
pick up the receiver and someone
answers.) The officer. who is in
turn notiﬁed immediately. can then
stop anybody who is suspected

before the person gets out of the

building.

Another problem ofﬁcers have.
according to Green. is they
themselves cannot press charges

against a thief once he is caught.
Green said anyone who sees
another person stealing, or sus-
pects someone, should remain calm
and note identifying details. he
said victims should be willing to
follow through to the hearing if a
thief is caught, because that will
discourage repeat performances
and set an example for anyone else
with acquisitive ideas. He said the
district attorney prosecutes the
offenders and there is no expense
involved for the person ﬁling
charges.

Now that it’s too late, I agree
with him completely. When my
purse was taken, I did everything
wrong. I did suspect a man and _I
followed him (right past the
emergency phones) out of the
library to his car. But I was afraid
to say anything, because if he were
the wrong man I might have
embarrassed him. Green said
anyone has the right to ask a
suspected thief to stop and wait to
be searched by the ofﬁcer on duty.

I did another thing I regret now.
The South Side police called me
three days later and said they
found my credit cards on a girl they
arrested for prostitution. (At least
one other girl got her cards back
that way.) Since I was sure the
thief had been a man and the girl
could only be ‘charged with
receiving stolen property, I declin-
ed to press charges. Green pointed
out that ﬁling charges against her
may have resulted in her revealing
the name of the man who gave her
the cards. (She told police her
boyfriend gave them to her. but she
wouldn't name him.)

So okay, I flubbed it. While I
was worried about embarrassing a
suspect and feeling humanitarian
toward a hooker, I was neglecting
my responsibility to all the innocent
people who frequent the library.

It's too late now. But it isn't too
late to ward off another rash of
thefts this spring. And one has
already begun.

Since January, three or four
people who “just didn’t know” are
reporting to the checkout desk
every month. Green and I agreed
it's time to repeat a warning—now,
before the problem becomes
epidemic again——sothe library isn’t
such an easy mark for these
parasites. (If any parasites are
readingthis——asof three weeks ago
the officer on duty can have all the
doors locked within seconds when a
theft is reported. All the better to
catch you.

Since I fell short of my civic duty
last year. I'm making up for it now
by voicing my opinion. I'd like to
see some other people help out.

and checkout desks of the library
where everyone—-—especially those
who are new on campus—can see
them.

Petition Signers
Not Bought

As a means of distributing
information on campus, the Pitt
News is unrivaled by any other
organization at Pitt. Therefore, the

‘Pitt News has more of an

opportunity than any other organi-
zation to shape public opinion,
especially among students and
faculty. Like the Student Govern-
ment Board’s endorsement of
ROTC accreditation, the editorial in
Monday, March 21’s issue “could
sway at least ﬁve people on the FAS.
council. Power like this deserves
more care about the direction in
which it is channeled.”

Obviously, the Pitt News staff is
against credit for ROTC courses.
Just as obviously, you have the right
to make your position known. But
this right carries with , it the
concurrent duty to do so fairly. Your
editorial did not fulﬁll this duty.
The article and cartoon suggested
that those campaigning for ROTC
accreditation either “bought” sig-
natures with orange juice and
frisbees or “forced” terrified
students into signing. Therefore
(your article claims), the support of
those who signed the petition is in
doubt and should not be considered
by SGB. May I point out that this is
not a small backwoods community
in the 1800’s where support is given
to the highest bidder. Do you really
believe the typical, supposedly
well-educated college student can
be swayed by orange juice and
frisbees? Be serious, gentlemen.
Maybe I’m just overly naive, but
that argument fails to convince me.
In fact, I am insulted (as I am sure
that most other students at the
University are) that you would
question my integrity by suggesting
such a thing. Of course, we know
the only students worthy of respect
are these who support your side,
don’t we?

You also suggest that since
“only” 2,500 of a possible 12,000
students signed the petition, its
relative importance is doubtful and
that those who collected the
signatures are turning a serious
debate “into a circus.” This is a
ﬁne argument, except for a few
minor fact _that you seem to have
“overlooked.” First, compare the
2,500 signatures with the number of
votes cast in student elections for
the past few years. As such a
comparison shows, any time anyone
can get 2,500 people on this campus
to do anything, it is quite an
accomplishment, especially if it is to
get them to agree on one side‘ of an
issue. On a campus where a few
hundred votes is enough to elect a
student government president,
“only” 2,500 signatures isn’t
doing badly.

Of course, in order to get this
many signatures, you ﬁrst have to
get the student body’s attention.
This is obviously the reason for
orange juice, frisbees and “I did it”
buttons. (If I were going to “bribe”
acollege student, I could certainly
ﬁnd a better beverage than orange
joice to do it with.) And, may I
remind you of the events of a few
years ago when ROTC students also
tried to get credit for their work? At
that time, they did not try to get a
petition signed. Instead, they tried
to conduct a serious debate and
presented the issue to the FAS.
When the FAS met to vote, the

O ‘ meeting was picketed by a handful

(closer to 25 than to 2,500) vocal
activists (most of whom incidentally

belonged to the Young Socialists
Alliance). complete with signs and
local television coverage. Now that
is an example of a small minority
creating a circus to obscure the
opions of the majority!

Finally, I have a suggestion. If
you are so sure the vast majority of
students do not favor accreditation,
why not circulate your own petition?
After all, it’s not hard to collect
signatures. You should be able to
collect at least 5,000 Why not try
it and publish the results? That
would be much ‘more persuasive
than printing ' a totally biased
editorial that will be answered only
by a letter tucked into the back
pages a week or two later.

By the way, for those who are
interested, I am a fairly liberal law
student who “didn’t do it.” In fact,
Ididn’t even sign the petition, since
the opportunity was not presented
to me. Thus, I am not directly

_ ‘affected by, the argument. V
A Accreditation of ROTC courses is

not going to help me. But then, it
isn’t going to hurt me, either. I
happen to believe a student should
be allowed to decide what course to
take, since it is his future which will
be affected. Just because I don’t
like something is no reason to
punish you for liking it. More
importantly, however, I am affected

by irresponsible one-sided journal- A

ism such as the editorial in
question. This time it was ROTC;

nexttime it may be me...or you. ‘

No Legitimate
Campus Role

As I understand Mr. Pellegrini in
his article, “Points Behind ROTC
Credit,” the merit in granting the
ROTC program academic credit
rests upon the value of a University
education for the career soldier. It
seems to me the issue is not
whether ofﬁcers beneﬁt from a
university education, but whether,
accrediting ROTC is compatible
with the idea of a university
education.

_ As an opponent of ROTC
accreditation nine years ago, I took
the position that ROTC should lose
its credit status and be given
extra-curricular activity status.
Now, as then, I assert that the

value of ROTC training is not

diminished by its non-credit status,
but the University would be greatly
diminished by crediting work that,
in fact, is in the service of
obedience and destruction, and not

inquiry and human growth. The '

military has no legitimate role on
campus.

sWhether or not the military
establishment is necessary is not
the issue. Whether or not an
educated soldier is preferable to an
ignorant one is not the issue. It is a
matter of deciding what will be
taught and by whom. No course
worthy of university credit need be
taught in an accredited ROTC
program; such courses might be
taught-——perhaps with the same
instructors——in the departments
under which they fall. What might
be reasonably expected of the
ROTC program is an explanation of
how its area of study and its
methods are compatible with the
University and how its work is not
as well done by other departments.
However one conceives of the
university’s obligation to prepare
its students for a role in society,
one must concede that it is
necessary that the role and function

of the university in that society be
clearly understood. Mr. Pellegrini
gives insufﬁcient weight to his apt
observation that higher education
is an optimistic enterprise and the
military is a negative enterprise. It

is as though he will not
acknowledge what he believes to be
true: bravery is not courage.

retribution is not justice, obedience
is not temperance and knowledge is
not wisdom. All University
activities should foster and support
the inquiring, rigorous and com-
passionate mind; those activities
that cannot meet that standard
must be excluded; not because they
are worthless, but because they are
antiethical to the idea ' of a
university education.

Editorial : Pathetic
A Installment

The March 21 Pitt News editorial
entitled “ROTC Support Doubted”
is a pathetic installment in a series
of efforts to prevent the accredita-
tion of ROTC. The Pitt News (or
perhaps more accurately, one
writer) took it upon himself to_
blatantly insult the intelligence of
2,446 students who ‘fsigned the
petition without strongly believing
in the ROTC-stand” and criticized
the Student Government Board for
acting “rashly" in its recent move
to support accreditation.

Not only was the article logically
inconsistent, but it proceeded to
engage in the same type of
Madison Avenue tactics the writer
so vigorously denounced. If 2,500
signatures have indeed drowned
out the voice of the opposition, as
the article asserts, the opposition
must not be very large. Twenty-ﬁve
hundred signatures on a petition is
a better representation of student
attitudes than those being portray-
ed by small special interest groups
and ridiculous attempts at editorial
writing. It has not been my purpose
to honor this ﬁne example of yellow

journalism with a reply, but rather
to inform the writer that he has
succeeded in inﬂuencing at least
one opinion—make that 2,447 in
favor of credit for ROTC.

Editorial- ‘Yellow
Journalism’

In reference to your editorial on
ROTC in the March 21 issue of the
Pitt News, perhaps the editors of
the paper should give some
“consideration of fact.” This
editorial is based on blatant
presumptions and distortions, and
smacks of yellow journalism.

Who “doubts” support for
ROTC credit exists among a
majority of the student population?
How responsible is it for a
newspaper to base an editorial on
"doubt” when
evidence that exists points .toward
student support of ROTC credits? I
refer, of course, to the‘ ROTC‘
petitions. Admittedly, over 50
percent of the student population‘s
signatures were not obtained, but
let’s look deeper than the “face
value" you refer to.

Since the petitions were aimed at
CAS students in particular, let us
consider only the 8,000 students
in CAS. In fact, many students and
staff from outside CAS did sign the

petitions, but this number totals
approximately 500 names. This
leaves us with 2,000 out of 8,000
CAS students signing our petitions
in just eight school days. Once
again, not a majority, but clearly.
one-quarter of the CAS population
expressing support for ROTC credit
is hardly insigniﬁcant in the face of
no similar evidence for the other
side of the issue. Clearly, if one
assumes 3,000 CAS students
were asked to sign our petition (a
number which would be quite high
from my experience), these 2,000
names become extremely signiﬁ-
cant. I coordinated the Army
ROTC side of the petition drive and
must say that an estimate of 1,000
“turn-downs” is quite liberal. In
any case, and with any numbers,
2,000 or 2,500 is certainly more
signiﬁcant than 10 or 15 people’s
“doubts.” All kidding aside, I
must have my “doubts” about
them.

Contrary to the editor’s opinions,
the signatures were not “bought"
with free orance juice and frisbees
and all other manner of induce-
ments. To set the matter straight,

the “I Did It" campaign is a

National ROTC recruiting‘ drive.
The fact that it coincided with the
petitions is merely coincidence.

The “I Did It’’ campaign was
planned many weeks before the
petition drive. The latter was
conceived, planned and carried out
in the space of 16 days. The
participants simply used what was
available to them, one part of which
was the already arranged for “I Did
It" booths. I don’t deny free
orange juice, etc. was given away;
however I must deny it was used as
a “treat” for signing the petition.
ROTC’s stand on the issue and the
facts behind that stand were
presented to the student, either
verbally or in writing if he so
wished and the student made his
own decision whether to sign or
not. The fact free o.j. was also
being given away at the booth
should not have «swayed any
responsible student, and I’m sure
that for most it didn’t. Quite a

number of students accepted the
“treat for signing” and then not

only didn’t sign the petition, but.

also argued over the issue with the
booth workers for a time. I feel
sorry for anyone who signs
something thinking they must
because they accepted a free glass
of orange juice.

I’m also sorry the editors
themselves were swayed by one
letter from one girl who signed and
then changed her mind. For
someone who is “ignorant” of the
issues, she certainly presented
many of the opposition’s oft-used
anti-ROTC gibberish.
ately, the facts do not back up her
stand, but .apparently the editors
don't need such frivolities.

While the subject is mentioned,
let’s look at the facts:

ROTC wants academic credit;
not credit for military training,
which they don’t want and don’t
expect, but credit for academic
courses that are equal to any in
CA5 that the ROTC student must
pay for, that cover disciplines equal
to many in the University, and that
must meet CAS approval. These
courses are taught by military
ofﬁcers who must have at least a
master’s degree and who are
reviewed and hired or ﬁred for any
reason whatever by the University.
I could go on and on, but these are
our main points. We are taking
courses equal to any
University but are receiving. no
credit for them.

Clearly to any logical mind your

A editorial was totally unfounded. If

the ROTC campaign has turned the
debate into a circus, then the Pitt

urge you to put more thought into

whole gamut of causes, ranging
from “native American rights” to
the legalization of marijuana. But it
has also taken an active role in
issues affecting the University
communitiy. Just this past
Wednesday, the coalition hosted a
joint talk by Marxist ex-prof Paul

- Nyden and James Logan, an

attorney who works for the National
Emergency Civil Liberties Commit-
tee (NECLC). NECLC, believe it or
not, split from ACLU in the early
, ’50s because the latter was not
radical enough. In a handout

distributed at the law school earlier
this week, NECLC took credit for
defending Nyden, Dr. Spock,
Daniel Ellsberg and various other
eminents of the second rank.

This article should not be taken as
an indictment of any particular
individual. Indeed, many of those
who are active in these groups are
quite sincere in their belief that they
are furthering the cause of civil
liberties. The only purpose here is to.
inform the reader of the true nature
of these groups so they can judge for
themselves whether -or not to

support them. Unfortunately, this
article will probably be miscon-
strued and twisted by its critics.
They would do well to heed the
words of the late Senator Joseph
McCarthy: “The pattern of the
Communist-inspired smear brigade
differs but very little from case to
case. Never do they answer the
documented evidence. Always they
avoid the issue by trying to discredit
and destroy whoever is a threat to
the Communist conspiracy. Innu-

their answer.”

Blowing in the Wind  

By KEN GORMLEY

An old farmer sat on the porch of
his Cannonsburg home, chewing
on a piece of spring-grass. It was
just like any other Saturday
afternoon...until an old looking
yellow and black checkered truck

 

rumbled up. a

The driver, a 40-year-old man
with short black hair, hopped out
“Excuse me, sir, my name's Ron

okay if we take off from your
field?” I

With a bewildered nod, the old
farmer grunted his approval.
Before he knew what was happen-
ing, the balloonist and his crew had I
dragged a giant wicker basket-
stuffed full of equipment———out of
the truck.

The limp orange and yellow
balloon was a good 50 feet long
when it was rolled out onto the‘
muddy ground. A

A Crowd Of picture-taking '
spectators clicked their camera.s as
Barth lit a propane torch and shot
ﬂames into the mouth of the vinyl
monster.

The balloon greedily ate the hot
air until it bloated up to gigantic

   
 
 
  

, proportions-—five stories high and

40 feet across.

Barth motioned for my friend,
Pickel, and myself to climb into the
massive woven basket. While the
rest of the crew held on, the
aeronaut made a last minute check
and jumped in. ’

“Okay, let her go,”Barth yelled.
Amid cheers and whistles, we
ﬂoated up into the clear blue sky.

Pickel and I clutched desperately
to the side of the basket as we rose
a few hundred feet above the
ground.

“Don't worry,” Barth laughed.
“You’ll get used to being up here
in no time." 0

Sure. What was there to be
afraid of? I took a bold step
towards the side of the basket and
peered over the edge.

but air between us. X

My fingernails dug back into the
wicker strands and I tried
desperately to regain my compo-
sure.

WOOSHH! A loud blast deafen-
ed my ears—Barth was pulling a
lever above me and I could feel tiny
ﬂames licking the top of my head.
This guy was a madman.

“Relax,” he said, ﬂicking the
lever back off. “That just sends the
heat up into the balloon to keep us
up in the air. It only generates
three million BTU’s an hour."

‘Doo-Dah ’ : Records, Not Baby- Talk

By TOM WASELESKI

Doo-Dah. Two syllables and
corny. But to Dan Charny,
proprietor of Bouquet Street’s new
Doo-Dah Record Shop, the name is
worth a hundred bucks———what it
costs city shopowners to hang a
shingle with a name other than their
own. a

Dan Charny’s Records wasn’t_
Dan Charny’s idea of a _catchy

name, so he sprang the extra

hundred for his store license and
splashed it on a wooden door about
50 yards from where Roberto
Clementeused to plant his cleats in
Forbes Field.

A Slippery Rock grad with his
master’s in education from Pitt,
Charny left academia, in his case a
junior high English class in Mars,
Pa., to kick off Oakland’s ﬁrst store
to deal in previously owned records
and science fiction books.

“I felt the time was right for
something different,” the bearded,
elfish Charny says, presiding over
jammed racks of single albums
selling for $2 (double albums going
for $3.50).

“I had gone through my own
record collection, yanking out the
ones no longer of interest to me.
That was 1,000 science fiction
novels, too, that I decided to put up
for sale.

“They were mostly things I was
buying at ﬂea markets and garage
sales,” Charny smiles "I knew

  

,-someday rd‘ da "$9it1e'i3ing with I  “W” Wtfls

But the Doo-Dah Shop doesn’t
house only Charny’s cast-offs. Half
his business is buying albums in

‘Fine” condition from anyone who
comes through Doo-Dah’s doors.
Most trade-ins bring $1, other 50
cents.

“Anybody who owns 100 albums
probably has a good 10to 20 percent
he's disappointed with,” he says,
“and that same 10 or 20 percent is
eagerly sought by other listeners.”

Charny examines the stack of
records just brought to him for
trade. “I call it exchanging your
taste for someone 'else’s taste,” he ,
says. .S1iding the black disc out, he
holds it up to his eve and checks it

, .

  
   

  

for marks. He ﬂips it over, following
the silvery glare on every track.
After he puts in his five hours at
Doo-Dah, he’ll take most of the new
trades home and play them on his
own system. Every record that
comes into the store, Charnysays,
is cleaned with__Discwasher ﬂuid.
“If there's a hiss, I’ll mark it on
the cover and sell it for a buck and
not make anything. All our albums,
though, are guaranteed.”
Sometimes taking in 100 new

albums a day doesn’t leave Charny

much time in the evening for his
own pursuit, writing fiction poetry.
His goal nevertheless is to rake
them in at Doo-Dah at the same

blistering pace.

“People who come in are amazed
they’re getting a great album for
only $2,” he laughs, “and the thing
is, the selection changes every
day.”

LOST IN SPACE

Pickel and I crouched suspicious-
ly over the side to avoid getting

singed hair. “How are the guys in — '

your truck going to follow us?”
Pickel asked as we drifted farther
away from Cannonsburg.

“I just contact them on this CB,”
Barth said, grabbing the little
green radio. “Come in chase car.
Balloon to chase car.” No answer.

“Damn it,” the aeronaut cursed.

“The channel I was supposed to '

call them on is burned out. Let's
hope they can see where we re
going.” _

Great. Here we were 800 feet in
the air and our communications
were burned out. ,

“Did you ever get completely
lost from the Chase Car?” I asked,
saying a silent prayer.

“Sure. The last time it happened
I spent the night in a cornfield,
trying to keep the cows away from
my balloon. For some reason,

, animals hate this thing.”

Oh well, Idecided. Might as well
enjoy the ride. It might be our last.

It was a beautiful day. The sun
spread a path of light through the
sky as we glided over sparkling
lakes and rolling hills.

Surprisingly enough, Pickel and I
were getting used to Walking
around in the small enclosure. We
hung over the edge of the basket
and watched a small town come
into sight.

“Hello down there," Barth
screamed, ﬂailing his arms around

Barth reached up and, twistint
the lever. sent another loud blast of
heat into the balloon.

“Aren't you afraid of this thing
blowing up?” Pickel asked suspi-
ciously.

“Hell no,” Barth grinned. “This
balloon is completely safe. About
the worst thing that could, happen
is an on-board ﬁre. If that
happened, we’d have to pull this
cord,” hesaid, toying with a thin
red ripcord dangling from the top

- of the balloon.

“That would let air out, and.we’d
hit the ground about as hard as if
we were hitched to a parachute.
Might end up with a couple broken
legs—but nothing serious.”

We were swooping down tow-
ards a long stretch of farmland and
the chase car still wasn’t behind us.
It was getting late and Barth was
starting to get a little worried.

Worried? Not me. I was
petriﬁed. Visions of wild-eyed
cattle stampeding all over the
“strange visitors from the sky”
kept ﬂashing through my mind.
What could be a worse death than
being trampled into cow dung?

“Balloonist to chase car. Come
in chase car.” Still no answer. The
balloonist switched to, Channel 9.
“Balloonist to ‘chase car.”

“Get off this channel,” a
forbidding voice cackled over the
radio. “This is for emergencies
only." -

“Listen,” Barth snapped back.
“This is an emergency.” ‘

“We’re right next to that chase
car," a voice on the CB announced.
“Can we help you out?”

was talking to his crew, directing
them to the road below.

We heaved a sigh of relief as the

“Where are you going?” a voice‘

ﬁltered through the sky.

The balloonist-made a ﬁnal call
on the CB-—we were going to land
in the ﬁeld up ahead.

He gradually brought the pear-
shaped craft down to tree top level.
“By the way fellows,” he‘ casually
mentioned, tugging on_ the red
ripcord. “You better hold on tight.

Pickel and I crouched down

WAMM! We smacked the
ground with a solid "thud, our
bodies smashing against the tanks.

“Don’t let go,” our undaunted
navigator warned. “We’re not

We sure weren’t. The wind~lifted
us a second and third time, drillin
us against the cold hard ground. It
finally deposited us, our brains
slightly scrambled, next to an old
junk yard. '

A teenage boy, ‘desperately in
need of his ﬁrst shave, sped up to
us on his dirt-bike. Behind him was

. a crowd of curious country folk,

wondering what in tarnation this
thing was that fell from the sky .

The aeronaut motioned the
people back and carefully rolled up
his precious $8,000 equipment into

' a compact bundle. .

A SAD ENDING

Somewhere back in Cannons-
burg, an "old farmer sat on his
porch, listening to the crickets
chirp. It had been just like any
other Saturday for him...until that
crazy looking- yellow and black
checkered truck had pulled up.

There was something magically

intriguing about that balloonist and
his orange and yellow craft.

Someday, he thought, he would 4

like to ride in a balloon and drift
fromvcloud to cloud.

But “someday” would never
-come-—and the farmer knew it.
Like too many other poeple, he’d
spend the rest of his days sitting on
the porch, dreaming.

Springsteen Finds
Tough Life in Rock  

By PETE DICKS

The phenomenon of “Roots”

has struck and suddenly it appears

as if everyone is becoming

concerned with their origins. Every
time Bruce Springsteen stepped on

stage during his recent tour of the

Midwest, he proved he has never

forgotten this.

 

, Ever since several rock music

     

Bruce Springsteen, pitured above in a recent concert with band members

critics hailed the once unknown
Asbury Park, N.J., resident as “the
new Dylan” and “the future of rock
and roll,” Springsteen has had to
cope with the tremendous media
hype that tried to elevate him to the
status of “superstar” before most
people had even heard his music.
The media buildup peaked with
Time and Newsweek both putting
him on their covers in the same
week in October, 1975, creating

 

Clarence Clemons and Miami Steve Van Zandt, has found record companies,
managers and unwanted stardom a sometimes painful part of being a popular

rock performer.

’Slap Shot’

 

By M.C. PILECKI

Slap Shot
Directed by George Roy Hill
Showcase Cinema

Sometimes, even when a movie
works in a lot of ways, it’s too easy to
see the many things wrong with it.
, “Slap Shot” is like that. It’s
bloody, messy, gross and has an
ending that makes no sense. It’s
also very funny and very real, with a
lot going for it.

The movie has been getting a lot
of local press ever since it was
announced that a major ﬁlm was
going to be shot in nearby
J ohnstown, a small town famed only
for being ﬂooded occasionally (1889
and 1936, to be exact). It’s nice to
report the ﬁlm is not a disaster of
those proportions, although it
doesn’t look like the big box office
number one could have hoped for.

In “Slap Shot,” Johnstown is
"tightly converted into Charlestown,

a grimy northeastern industrial
town whose leading (and almost
sole) industry, the steel mill, is
being shut down. That sets the
stage for the Charlestown Chiefs, a
ﬁfth-rate’ (and place) minor league
hockey team just as certain to close
with the mills.

Now for the story. Chiefs’
player-coach Reggie Dunlop (Paul
Newman), knowing the team will be

A disbanded at the end of the season,

goes to extreme lengths to create a
winner, which, he hopes, will keep
the franchise alive. Mainly, he
turns his losers into ﬁghters-
brawlers who intimidate opponents
and obtain many “cheap” wins.

Dunlop runs into problems,
though, with teammate Ned Braden
(Michael Ontkean). a well-to-do
Yalie who’s deﬁnitely out of place
in Charlestown and who will have
nothing to do with such Philadel-
phia Flyer-like tactics.

Meanwhile, Dunlop is trying to
win back his estranged wife
Francine (Jennifer Warren) with

Diamond: Record

By TOM WASELESKI

Love at the Greek
Neil Diamond
Columbia Records, KC2-34404.

What do you do when you're Neil
Diamond and you record another
live double album after the ﬁrst one,
“Hot August Night,” ranks with
the liveliest of the live?

You borrow the best songs from
the first live one, sneak in a couple
of g1.1est stars for an added gimmick
are :1 hold your breath that you don't
fall ﬂat on your commercial face._
You hold it really hard. M

Right off the bat, it would
probably serve this reviewer well to
say “Love at the Greek” is not as
hot’ as that night in August,
although it’s vintage Neil Diamond.

Diamond’s covered some ground
since the last monster live set and so

Seagull suite’ instead of the more
dynamic line up of ‘ ‘Holly Holy, ’ ’ “I
Am...I Said,” “Soolaimon” and
“Brother Love.”

Much of the material here is what
TV viewers applaudedon the recent
Neil Diamond special, including the
excuse for a new single, “Song
Sung Blue” featuring Helen Reddy
and Henry “The Fonz” Winkler.

The zest, of a live Diamond
concert gushes forth despite his
more reserved material of late. The
album is set up with Diamond’s
concert format, from overture
(“Streetlife”) to climaxing suite
(“Jonathan”) and encore (“I’ve
Been This Way Before”).

The best music is, without a
doubt, the selections from his last
album of original material, ‘ ‘Beauti-
ful Noise.” _

The title track is as bustling as the
studio version and the recording
quality is nearly as full as “Hot

Springsteen’s current problem is
a lawsuit and countersuit involving
his former manager and producer,
Mike Appel. Springsteen contends
Appel took far more than his share
of income; Appel’s countersuit
supposedly has prevented Spring-
steen from even entering‘ a
recording studio, thus delaying his
long-awaited fourth album.

As a result of no new album since
the release of “Born to Run” in
August, 1975, rumors and skepti-
cism about Springsteen have been
slowly growing.

1973, Springsteen’s record com-

refused to play his records.

His second album, “The Wild,

The pressures on anyone thrust into

Bruce Springsteen has under-

pressures that comprise the high
price of success. Springsteen’s
casual attitude about money is a key
factor. John Hammond, the
Columbia talent scout who dis-
covered Billie Holiday, Aretha

’O|ivei’s Story Not Worth It

. phenomenon of boy meets girl, boy

loses girl has WASP lawyer Oliver
Barrett IV still choked up over the
death of his wife Jenny, which
happened three years before.

Barrett retains a close relation-
ship with Jenny’s father, Phil, who
keeps urging him to stop mourn-
ing.
distance from his formidable
father, Oliver Barrett III, which is
surprising, since the end of “Love
Story" indicated a reconciliation
between father and son.

Barrett quits his job with a
prestigious law ﬁrm, moves out of
his luxury apartment and becomes

' an advocate of minorities, operating

out of a slum dwelling. Out on the
jogging trails in Central Park,
Barrett meets his second Mrs.

Springsteen :

He’ also keeps a sizeable .

Right——WASP heiress Marcie Bin-
nedale.

The romance preceeds smoothly
Barrett takes Binnedale home to
end that Barrett is ﬁnally taking up
with a member of his own social set.
Barrett sulks throughout the
evening and on the ride back to
New York, Binnedale pinpoints his
anger to the fact that his parents
had not been altogether enthusias-
tic when he introduced them to
Jenny. '

Their relationship completely
unravels when Barrett discovers
that Binnedale’s family fortune
comes from years of continued ex-
ploitation in the Orient. Then, he
returns to Boston to manage the

family business—the Barrett for-_

tune comes from continued ex-
ploitation of Rhode Island com-
munities.

At the book’s end, Barrett
answers the question—what would
happen if Jenny were still
alive?

“Then I would also be alive,” he

' concludes.

The only people who will read this
book are people who loved the
original, which is fortunate. “Love
Story,” for all its faults, came at a
time when it was desperately
needed. Everyone was disillu-
sioned from the Viet Nam War, the
Nixon administration, unrest of the
’60s; the simplicity of a love story
waslwelcomed by almost everyone.
This is not to say that times now are
any less disappointing, but resur-
recting “Love Story” is unneces-
sary and purposeless.

Segal’s style—terse sentences,
short chapters and what he tries to
pass off as wit, does not work the
second time around. And this book
looks suspiciously like Segal’s quick
shot for a fast buck from
romanticists who think. they’ll
waterlog their tear ducts again.

“Oliver’s Story” has already
been told much better. Leave this
losing rerun to the “Harlequin
Romances” freaks-—it’s just not
worth it.

There is no feeling of nostalgia

tries to get a feeling for a rough
town and its rough jocks, and does
so unevenly but with great gusto.
Newman’s character, like before, is
a conman-type somewhat out of his
mien, a winner and loser simul-
taneously, while unsure of both.

The main problem with “Slap
Shot” is an ending that, although
riotously funny, changes the ﬁlm
from satire to farce and resolves
nothing. After the ﬁlm, one is still
left trying to ﬁgure out what
happened and why the characters
did such about-faces. '

Among the best scenes in the ﬁlm
is the one in which Dunlop
confronts the team’s mystery
owner. His innocent vulgarisms are
definitely out of place in exclusive
Ligonier and he can’t accept the fact
that the team, even though -a winner
and proﬁt-maker, is going to be
dissolved as a tax loss. His own
little inhumanities of lying, insult-
ing and badgering seem banal when
compared to the socialite’s callous
disregard of the lives and futures of
the players having their brains
beaten out for the team.

the Johnstown Jets, helped to
inspire the ﬁlm and also served as
technical advisor) has done a lot to

would have hoped, though for more

“Slap Shot” is ponderous at
times, but quite often hilarious with
a cathartic feeling at the end. The

probably for the preponderance of

Playoff Goal Shower?

By STEVE SYBERT

April showers may bring May ﬂowers, but when the showers
consist of enemy goals they bring a restful May for the Pittsburgh
Penguins. ,

Not only do the Penguins, who are in dire need to go as far as they can
in the playoffs each year just to break even money-wise, manage to pull
off a classic choke every year in the playoffs, they manage to do it in
style——like letting in series-winning goals only 11 seconds into an
overtime or dropping four in a row after winning the ﬁrst three.

A National Hockey League (NHL) member for 10 seasons, the
Penguins have made the playoffs only ﬁve times, including their assured
spot this season. In 1969-70, the year they ﬁnished second in the old
Western Division, the Penguins rolled over the defunct Oakland Seals,
four games to none, in the quarter-ﬁnals before being ousted by the St.
Louis Blues, then the class of the division four games to two. It was the
best season so far playoff-wise for the Penguins, despite losing 12 more
games than they won during the regular season. ’

In 1971-72, Pittsburgh crawled into the playoffs as a fourth-place
ﬁnisher only to be chased out by the then-powerful Chicago Black
Hawks,‘four games to none, in the quarter-ﬁnals on an overtime goal
that came with Stanley Cup playoff record quickness.

By finishing third in the newly-formed Norris Division in 1974-75, the
Penguins ended a two-year playoff drought, but after eliminating St.
Louis in the preliminary round, they suffered ‘the ultimate playoff
embarassment at the hands of the pesky, never-say-die New York
Islanders, breaking out of the gate to take a seemingly cinch 3-0 lead in
games won, but collapsingcompletely in the next four contests.

Penguins to Drown in

By STEVE SYBERT

Though on paper it would
appear the Pitt baseball team won’t
have much of a chance at the 11th
annual University of California at
RiV61'Side National Intercollegiate

Baseball Tournament, which starts
Monday, assistant coach Larry
Wayman and his players aren’t
about tothrow in the towel just yet.

A “All the teams are so good, so it is
anybody’s tournament--whoever is
playing the best at the time,”

Waymanproposed. “I really can’t
say how we’ll do because we
haven’t been outside to play a lot of
baseball. But there shouldn’t be
that great a difference in talent.”

‘ ‘Ithink we have as good a chance
as anybody,” junior catcher and
team captain Dan DeStout said.
‘ ‘Their playing more games is really
the only advantage they have over
us.”

Pitt, the eastern representative in
the prestigious tourney, will be
playing its very first games of the
1977 season, while opponents like
Missouri (46-22 last season),
Washington State (42-13), UCLA
(35-25), California (33-20), Oral

ever played as they culminated a
37-28-15 season—the club’s best
ever. But the goal scorers who lit
the red light an outstanding 326
times were quiet in the playoffs,
their guns silenced by a goalie
people claim looks like Freddie
Prinze—Islander Glenn Resch.
Last season, the Penguins
banged home an amazing 339 goals K
(second in the league) in compiling
a 35-33-12 record and taking third in

It was, however, the most
F 7
(Elle iﬁttt

‘ the Norris Division.

But again, lack of offensive punch and a porous defense that allowed 303
goals socred (fourth worst in the league) caused the Penguins’ downfall
against the Toronto Maple Leafs, two games to one, in the preliminary

round.

Pittsburgh clinched its spot in the playoffs for this season several
weeks ago, but now is in a tough battle to gain the important home ice
advantage for the opening round. Going into last night’s games, if the
playoffs were‘ held tomorrow, the Penguins would hold the
fourth-highest point total (77) of the eight playoff contenders that will
participate in the preliminary round (that is, those teams that did not
receive a bye after winning their respective divisions).

The Penguins’ opponent would therefore be the Los Angeles Kings
(or the Atlanta Flames, should Pittsburgh pass up Toronto in the stretch
run). The Penguins round out the regular season visiting Boston (March
27), hosting Washington (March 30), and a home-and-home series with
the Detroit Red Wings (April 2 and 3), with the season ﬁnale at the Civic

Arena. . .
After Boston’s presence, it is not

* a bad situation in which to be. The
, Penguins should be able to build up
 a head of steam to take into the
playoffs by ending the season
- against three lackluster opponents,
but they always seem to ﬁnd a way
to hasten their summer vacations.
This season, however, Pittsburgh
is playing more like a team than
ever-—and that’s what playoff
hockey is all about. With injuries to
key players such as Vic Hadﬁeld (30
goals), Lowell MacDonald (30
goals), defensemen Dennis Owchar
and Ed Van Impe and upcoming
rookie Greg Malone, the Penguins
have had to count on close-checking

and goaltending (they have scored only 229 goals and allowed 240, both
totals down from 1975-76 to salvage their 32-31-13 record.

When goalie Denis Herron broke his arm on opening night, the team
acquired much-traveled Dunc Wilson to back up rookie Gordon Laxton,
but Wilson turned in a number of stellar performances to give him a
share of the starting job when Herron returned from his injury. The
Penguins then found themselves displaying some of the stingiest
goaltending in the NHL—a sight not too common in Pittsburgh.

Pierre Larouche’s child-like beefs with the management and his
lackadaisical play has cut his goal production way down from last
season's 53, but the Pens were able to rely on the steadiness of veterans
Jeans Pronovost, Syl Apps, Rick Kehoe and Ron Shock, along with
surprising rookies Wayne Bianchin, Blair Chapman and Russ Anderson
to take up the slack caused by injuries.

The Penguins have been forced to rely on playoff-type hockey all

season long, so will only have to tighten their belts when post-season
play begins in several weeks. No, they will not win the Stanley Cup this
year and it is doubtful they will get past the quarter-finals as they appear
headed for a showdown with Montreal in that round.

But the Penguins deserve a lot of credit for warding off a downfall
similar to that of the New York Rangers or Chicago Black Hawks. With
their fine crop of rookies and goaltending. blended with experience and
a little luck, their time will soon come.

Phone-y on the Mound

BRADENTON, Fla. (AP)—Terry
Forster went home last October at
the end of the. American League
regular season and waited for the
telephone to ring. V

Forster, a lefthander who has
started and pitched both short and
long relief, knew he had had it with
the Chicago White Sox.

“I had gotten in a little argument
with management over how certain
pitchers were being handled, and
that was it,” Forster recalled. ‘‘I
didn‘t throw in one game the last
month or so of the season.”

Before he became the forgotten 5

man, Forster hadn't exactly set the
world on ﬁre. He posted a 2-12
record with a 4.38 ERA, starting 16
games and completing one.

Forster tries hard not to alibi that
poor record, but he feels compelled
to point out he pitched for one of
the weakest teams in baseball.
“Honestly, if you gave up two runs
it almost meant a certain loss,"
Forster said of the Sox.

He also tore ligaments and
tendons in his pitching arm two
seasons ago.
August of 1975, and didn’t return
until last year’s spring training.
Then. came the camp lockout. It
took Forster almost the entire 1976
season to regain the strength in his
arm. When he was ready, the Sox
relegated him to obscurity.

Forster said his problem wasn't
with Sox manager Paul Richards.
who he says did a ﬁne job with
what he had to put on the ﬁeld.

Well, the telephone ﬁnally did
ring. It was Chuck Tanner, new
manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates.
calling to inform the 25-year-old
Forster he had been acquired by
the Pirates. ' A

Tanner knew Forster's ability.
The 210-pound southpaw pitched
forthe Pirates‘ boss in Chicago for
ﬁve years. Tanner remembered

left the team in-

the _Forster who was American
League “Fireman of the Year” in
1974, winning seven and saving 24
games that season.

‘‘I’m elated to be here,” Forster '
_ said at the Pirates’ training camp.

“I've played for Chuck. He's my
type of manager. He’s exciting,
dynamic. He doesn’t second guess
you, he let's you pitch.”

Forster also is impressed with
the Pittsburgh team.

“This club has unbelievable
power," he said. “The defense
looks good, and there is a lot of
speed. The Pirates will apply a lot
of pressure on opposing pitchers
with their running game. The
team to beat is Cincinnatti.
Philadelphia has lost the right side

-of its infield.”

“This club Pittsburgh knows
what it takes to win," Forster said.
“Everybody here works hard. None
of the pitchers cheat on sprints. I
can’t wait to come out every day.
My arm is strong and I'm with a
team when you're two runs down in
the last. of the ninth you have a
good chance to still win.” ‘

junior second baseman Dan Smodic
and junior centerﬁelder Don Nania.
Skinner batted .257 last season with
ﬁve RBI’s and drew 15 walks in 50
trips to the plate.

“He’s really having a good
pre-season,” Wayman said of
Skinner, who started at shortstop in
1976. “We’re expecting a lot out of
him. We’re counting on him to
drive in runs and get on base.
Defensively, he's one of the better
ones.”‘ .

The Panthers, also show experi-
enced ballpayers at ﬁrst base and on
the mound, but the young
performers will provide a rash of
question marks. Senior Kurt

Leitholf, who was the top hitter last 1 1

year at .353, anchors the inﬁeld at
ﬁrst base, while senior designated
hitter Mike Bianco “will help us a
lot in getting runs in,” said
Wayman, a first-year assistant to
Lewis. B
Freshman Joe Adlesic has the
tough task of guarding the third
base line, while sophomores Mark
Stevens and Gary Majetic, fresh-

man Tony Roperti and junior Kenny

Muckel will be ﬁghting it out to
ﬂank Nania in the outﬁeld. Two
utility men expected to see a lot of
action are pinch runner John Susi
and third baseman Duane Sakanich,
both freshmen.

“Our stong point is defense and

‘our sticks are coming around

improving really fast,” assessed

DeStout. “I think we will hold our

own out there.”

Seniors Don Kennedy and Les
Qualk are the only test hurlers on
the pitching staff, which Wayman
said , “doesn’t have any really
overpowering pitchers that just

beat down and ﬁre.”

Kennedy, a control pitcher and
counted on to be Pitt’s big .work
horse, pitched in eight games last
season, completed six and posted a
3-5 record with a 2.94 earnedrun
average (ERA). He also fanned 49
batters in 52 innings, while walking
only 20. Kennedy will be the starter
when Pitt takes on UCLA in the
tournament opener on Monday.

Qualk, who will start Wednesday _

against California at Riverside,
pitched four times in 1976,
completed two games for a 1-2
record and 4.87 ERA, while fanning
20 and walking 14 in 24 innings.
Sophomore Findley Wiley will get

the nod. in Tuesday’s contest with \

tough Missouri and freshman Jim
Boyle will face Washington State in
the nightcap of a Wednesday
doubleheader. Inexperience also
shows in the bullpen where
freshman Don Keller and sopho-
more Marc Bianco are set for duty.

Pitt will face Oral Roberts and
Brigham Young in another double-
header on Friday after a day off
Thursday, then wrap up the tourney
against California next Saturday
before returning home.

Wayman is optimistic the team
will fair well at Riverside in
preparation for its home opener
April 4 against Duquesne at Trees
Field.

BRADENTON, Fla. (AP)——Dave
Parker hit athree-run home run and
Al Oliver and Phil. Garner added
solo homers yesterday as the
Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Boston

‘Red Sox 8-1 in exhibition baseball.

Parker opened the scoring in the
first inning by driving in Frank

Boston didn’t‘ score until the
eighth when Ted Cox scored on
pitcher Bob Mongomery’s sacriﬁce
ﬂy.

It was the first win for Pirate

pitcher was Rick Wise.

The Pirates are now 5-9 and
