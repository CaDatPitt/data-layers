Wallace Backers Seek Forum
To F Discuss Third Party Issue

Students forwallace put it to Student Congress last Tuesday
‘to sponsor a “town meeting" to discuss “Should the American Peo-
ple S1.i_pport the Wallace Third Party."

Student Cong.ress merely tabled the matter
sion due to lack of time. But what has stirred discussion in ‘and
out of Student Congress are the arguments in a letterlsupporting
the Wallaceitcs town meeting idea.

The letter. which was from tl1cO—---—~—~-~~~-~— ——~~»-~-—~—  ~
‘executive committee of the Pitt

Students for Wallace, was read by
President George Lynn to Con-
gress: it charged ‘recognized stu-

peared on the Wallace'letter and
who was present at the Student
Congress ineeting.

Bob Dickey, a member of Stu-
dent Congress and Pi Kappa A1-
pha, said that a few individuals
from his fraterni'ty may have in-
dependently engaged in anti-Wal-
lace activities but he was certain
that the organization had not
backed any of these activities.

Dickey also said that the Pitt
News editorial “Tsk, Tsk, Chil-
dren" was not unfair, but that he

the Congress meeting that,Con-
gress could not act until March 18
when the Students Recognition
Committee considers a petition
from the Wallace group.

Staley said that the Wallacemen
were not counting on getting rec-
ognition because of lack of pre-
cedents.

He further replied that Student
Congress could sponsor the meet-
ing as one featuring individual
speakers both for and against
Wallace.

The charges, he said, against the
various organizations were to
show that recognized activities
had engaged in political activity
against an unrecognized Pitt group
(Students for Wallace) and there-
fore a concern of Student Con-
gress. This was only one reason.
he said.

After a brief session at the Du- . .

quesne Club yesterday afterhoon,
the ﬁve-man committee pleaded
for more time. The appeal was,
evidently, granted immediately as
no deﬁnite time was set for a fu-
ture report. -
Right away conjecture began as
to how long the probers could sit
on the report before hatching a
deﬁnite policy. They instituted in-
vestigations of two previous con-
ﬂicting reports on February 27.
Chairman Floyd Rose claimed
that business committments kept
him out of town and the commit-
tee felt that it would be improper
to issue an incomplete report at

this time. This statement was the

extent of the‘committee’s labors
thus far.

Observers advanced three the-
ories to account for the delay. The
ﬁrst, of course, was that the prob-
ers did not have sufficient time to
formulate a report. Theory num-
ber two has it that the Board of
Trustees were deadlocked over the
recommendations of the ﬁve-man
group and could not agree on pol-
icy.

‘The third theory is that the
Trustees discounted the reports. of
the Faculty Committee and the
Student—Alumni
had, decided to begin their own in-
vestigation. Skeptics in the stu-
dent body refuted all three theor-

ies and said it was the well-worn

stall.

No_Comp Rule
To Remain

Student Congress reiterated a
recent decision Tuesday when it
its “No complimentary

Jim Madden, Spring Festival
publicity director and veteran of

many dance committees, had ar- ‘A

gued for repeal of the law. He
said it was especially unfair for
those who did the drudgery work
on a dance to have to pay to go
to that dance. '

Congress held that the issuance

Again No Action

Now is the time for all trustees to come
to the aid of their University. In a situation
rapidly paling from tense to absurd, the latest
bit of malingering is going to do little to get
Pitt’s dirty laundry out of the public’s laugh-
ing eye.

The trustees we're expected to bring forth
almost any kind of action to precipitate the
problem. Expected steps were as varied as
there are views on the problem and past pub-
licity proves there are many views. But in-
.stead of action came more ostrich-like head
burying. ' -

Business commitments are reason to stay
out of the picture; hardly reason for more de-
lay. The trustees were committed to action——
and failed. Editorially we say, “Hah!”

Big Time Ball

The cry has gone up from certain dis-
gruntled quarters recently that-the military
is too much in evidence these days. Not so
here at Pitt. The military here, now at least,

_IP

is just right. As long as the military activity

is conﬁned to giving dances, especially like
the one in prospect tonight, no protest, we
feel sure, will be forthcoming.’ '

This is by way of welcoming back to the
campus one of the big social events of the
school year. The Military Ball with its music
to taste and professional decorations, couldn’t
have come back more auspiciously. We give the
military 21-gun salute.

Passion for Placement

Chuck Ebert, director of placement at the
University, has been on the suﬁering end of
a hoard of engineers for the past‘few weeks.
He has had the misfortune of being in the

middle of a struggle to ﬁnd capable men by
the various industrial concerns and the surge,

of anxious job pursuers.

Somehow, the placement bureau hasn’t

been able to ﬁnd _a balance. Many more men

are_asking for interviews than there is time
available for that purpose. Mr. Ebert is in a

» quandary.

In order to facilitate, the placement pro-
gram of the University, Mr. Ebert and the
News asl; all applicants to “consider the other
fellow” as much ‘as possible, “certainly,” Mr.

"Ebert contends, “every applicant doesn’t want

a" job with every ﬁrm that interviews here.”
Some enterprising graduates have applied with
ten diﬁereiit companies.

Mr. Ebert asks ‘that all men in their re-
spective departments of the University get
together beforehand and decide who really
wants to work for a particular ﬁrm. In this

‘manner, he hopes to satisfy all men with a

sincere interest. As it is, too many men must,
through time limitations, be excluded from the
possibility of obtaining a job. 2

 On School Acﬁviﬁes.

By Bill Veenis

People in activities are called most everything
by the people on the outside. In fact, many persons
who ‘should know better have dubbed the more
active student “college Joe.” Most black shoe stu-
dents feel that the activities man is a superﬂu-
ous quantity. ‘

-To many of the persons who give plenty
of time and effort around campus on a. purely
voluntary basis, the Pitt News has appeared to
take“ the position of the black shoe. Manyian
activities man or woman has felt that the Pitt
News as well as. many of the other students
and the administration do not. appreciate the
fact that they are trying to improve Pitt, give
it a‘ little spark toward school interest. ‘

In our many articles dealing with Student Con-
gress. Men’s Council, WSGA‘, the various dance
committees, the football probe, and other episodes
in student life, the Pitt News has taken a deﬁnite
stand. We have, in some cases, roundly criticised
the “students in charge” or the persons, from our
evidence, who seem responsible for a particular
failing. This is a natural thing for any newspaper
——college or otherwise. If a newspaper were to
relinquish this critical position, there would be
little or no immediate check on the leaders of
the campus, the community, or‘the nation.

To those students who have felt the edi-
itorial sting of the News, I. would like to make
one point clear: You are not the object of an
intensiﬁed smear campaign by the Pitt News
or any other’ organization on campus. If it
were possible to criticise and to say thank you
at the same time-—a« plan snubber by journal-
ism everywhere—we would like to do it. As
it is, you must feel that the News criticisms
are to improve rather than to tear down. _

From the standpoint of appreciation, the Pitt
News is more apﬂreciative than most factions be-
cause if it weren’t for the activities man, what
would ﬁll the columns of a twice-a-week, eight
page paper? The .News, in short, relies on you,’
the activities man or woman, for its very exist-
ence. We can do little else than appreciate your
Work.’ I

J an August’s booking at Mercur’s Music Bar

ing, April 7 in a Norman “Jazz At The Philhar-

will be moderate. Jack Young, Pittsburgh Mercury

of the expenses in order to help cut the rates.

superb rendition of a new but reminiscent

 Curb Comvmittee

   

 

Keeps llnder Wraps

Suggested measures to curb. cheating at the University. are
being studied by the combined deans’ committee and the recently

added student group.

A list of measures was submitted through the mail Monday
to each man on the panel by Mr. E. A. Holbrook. As yet, no actual
measures have been adopted‘ and the matter is still under investi-

gation by the group.

This latest Pitt probe was‘ insti-9‘

gated by faculty concern over the
increase in student cheating, es-
pecially during exams and quizzes.
The matter was brought up before
a meeting of the deans’ commit-
tee in November when the Chan-
cellor asked for a new policy with
respect to cheating. —

It was recognized that there was
a_ need for deﬁnite understanding
of the aspects of the problem on
the part of both students and fac-
ulty. Nine students were selected
by Men's Council to sit on the
board with regular members of

- the faculty group. No women were

selected.

They have declined to comment
on’ any progress made to date.
when queried, most of the student
and faculty members stressed that
no ofﬁcial action has been taken
and any action is merely under
consideration.

This may orimay not refereto
a rumor circulating that persons

 

0 ‘How

caught cheating will be summarily
expelled from the University. Oth-
er reports of expected steps vary
from reprimands to ﬁnes.

Primarily, the committee will
have to deﬁne what constitutes
cheating. It is expected that of-
fenses such as plagiarism on
themes and cheating on exams
will be punishable misdemeanors.
Penalties undoubtedly would vary
with severity. of the crime.

This will be determined, accord-
ing to the rumor, by disciplinary
committees established in each
school, presumably manned by
faculty members. There would be
s t a n d ar d procedure for‘ each
school. -

It is to be noted that other
schools that have tried this sys-
tem have had honor board mem-
bers elected by the student body.
These honor board members hold
trials and penalize their fellow‘
students who have been caught

cheating.

   

This is but one of the many questions telephone
men are called upon to answer.
A Part of their work has always been to anticipate
demands for personnel . . . to determine what
' additional equipment must be provided, what new
construction will be necessary to handle the con-.
stantly increasing demands for service.
Careful planning in every phase of telephone
' work requires the services of many qualiﬁed men.
For them, this growing business offers the oppor-
tunity for active, interesting careers. . ' " .p

As Eds,Win

When football players tangle on
a basketball court, ﬁreworks are

7bound to occur. This was the re-

sult of the Educators—Sports King
contest Tuesday at Trees Gym
when the Educators broke loose in
the second half to trounce their
rivals 71-42.

The game, up until the second
half, was a rough and tumble af-
fair with the Educators holding a
small margin over their oppon-1
ents. ‘

It wasn’t until the second quar-
ter that the winners could drop in
a ﬁeld goal. They had amassed
their points via the foul route,
connecting with 10 straight shots
before Guy Lateano pushed in his
two—pointer. '

Sparked by the accurate shoot-
ing of Lindy Lauro and Carl De-
Pasqua, top men for the Educators
in scoring with 16 and 17 points
respectively, the E d u c a t o r s
stretched their lead to. a comfort-
able margin in the third quarter.

A momentary scoringspurge by
Longoski - of the Sports Kings
proved of no avail as the ﬁnal
count ended .with the Educators

Mitterling Set
To Open Drills
For Field Posts

Ralph “Sarge” Mitterling, Pitt
baseball coach, turns his attention
from batterymen to inﬁelders and

announced that he wants all in-
ﬁelders and outﬁelders to report
for tryouts this afternoon or Mon-
day. _

Practice is held underneath the
Stadium, and the’ players should
report to Gate Three at three
o’clock or later.

New hopefuls, however, will
probably not get a chance to show
their stuff today, as the ﬁrst ses-
sion is usually consumed by the
issuing of lockers éind equipment.

Judging from last season’s try-
outs, some ﬁfty players will re-
port today.

For the past several weeks Mit-
terling has been drilling his pitch-
ers and catchers, and he has ex-
pressed satisfactory results. He
expects several rookie pitchers to
make good, and looks even more
favorably at the catchers.

With half a dozen receivers
showing good form, Mitterling is
in doubt as to whether last year’s
catchers, Matich and Schweinbat-
ten, will have an easy time stick-

29 points ahead.

By Myron Kopelman

A long thin, rosy—cheeked, baby-
faced pitcher meant the difference
between a winning and losing
season for last year’s Panther
baseball team. He is..Deryl Calder
of Beaver Falls.

Pitchers of Calder’s caliber are
probably the most scarce com-
modity in college baseball. If it
were not for ﬂoundering hurlers
with lo_ose control and little ef-
fectiveness, college games- would
draw a lot more than the handful
of spectators which now attend.

With Calder on the mound,
however, a Panther game is a
treat.

Panther squad last year. Coach

Ralph Mitterling was regretfully‘
-aware of this, and as a result,

Calder pitched in more than half

the games. ‘
Calder’s brilliance, furthermore,

has not gone unnoticed. He ‘has

been sought by the Dodgers,
Yanks, Giants, and Braves.
Brook1yn’s rush, however, has

been the most vigorous, reaching
the point where Deryl was invited

‘Sarge’ Calls Candidates

Gophs. 68-38

The Phys Ed Whips moved for-
ward in the IM elimination tour-
ney Tuesday at Trees Gym when
they completely outplayed the
Gophers and walked away with
a 68-38 score.

Holding their opponents score-
less during the initial period, the
victors tallied 17 points. George
Radosevich

creased their margin of 40-6 at
the end of the ﬁrst half.

Radosevich and DeRosa were
high men for the winners with
17 and 16 points respectively.

Fifty Candidates

Fifty varsity track veterans and
candidates will compete unattach-
ed tomorrow in the indoor Junior
championships at South
Park’s Schoonmaker Hall, starting

. at 12:30 p.m. -
It is the ﬁrst of three indoor

events for the Carl Olson proteges
in the next three weeks.

Pitt will send a delegation to

Deryl Calder Bypassed Dodger
Offer to Hurl for '48 Panthers

California Teachers, on arthree-hit
diet to win a 9-1 ball game. “Yes,
that was easily my best day in
college ball,” says Deryl with self-
satisfaction.

Summertime ﬁnds Calder pitch-
ing for the town sandlot club of
East.Pa1estine, Ohio. “I guess I
got my biggest kick when our
Palestineteam went into the State
playoffs last year,” he said.

“Nope, we didn’t win.”

Although his main love is base-
ball, Calder took a ﬂing at foot-,
ball while at Beaver Falls high.
He was a halfback, but after suf-'
fering a knee injury in his first

year decided he had better stick,

to the diamond sport. _

Luckily, the knee injury wasn’t
serious or Ralph Mitterling’s hair
might have been a lot grayer than
it is today.
