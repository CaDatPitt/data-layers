Med School Opens Lab

For Arthritis Research

By scofrr LARSON
The University announced the opening of a combined
rheumatology-orthopedic laboratory which will be located
on the connecting wing between Scaif Hall and Presby-
terian Hospital, at a news conference held at the Medical

School last week.

On the opening of the new installation, Dr. F. S. Cheever,

Dean of the Medical School, said,“

“The program housed in this new
laboratory represents the most
promising opportunities in the
nation for combined research on
the medical and surgical aspects
of arthritis and other related
crippling diseases.”

The facilities will be operated
by the Section of Rheumatic Dis-
eases of the Department of Medi-
cine, headed by Dr. Gerald P.
Rodman, and the Department ‘of
Orthopedic Surgery under the
direction of Dr. -Albert B. Fergu-
son.

One of the projects planned by
the two groups will be radioiso-
tope studies to determine the cir-
culation of various substances to
and from the joints in health and
disease. An example of this proj-
ect would be to trace the ions of
metals which have been used in
the body as they circulate in the
bloodstream.

Projects currently under the
study of Dr. Rodman and Dr.
Margaret J. MacLachlan in-
clude the metabolism of uric
acid in gout, hemophilic arth-
ritis, the nature of heritable
factors in rheumatic disease
(particularly rheumatoid arth-
ritis. scleroderma,’ lupus, and
gout), and biochemical and ser-
ological abnormalities in the
diseases of the connective tis-
sues.

The members of the orthopedic
team include Dr. Ferguson, Dr.

W Thomas Brower, Dr. Patrick G.

g Laing, andsDr. Henry J . Mankin.

The addition of the new labor-

atory will help in making the

complex of Oakland hospitals and
the University’s Medical School
one of the finest centers for the
treatment of hemophilia sufferers.
Dr. Cheever concluded, “We
trust that this fusion of talents
and knowledge will prove to be a
most effective approach to a bet-
ter understanding of these dis-
eases.”

the ﬁndings will not be publicized.

The ﬁnal report of the three-
man committee of the legal ﬁrm
of Eckert, Seamans and Cherin,
who have been investigating the
charges against Dr. Robert Colod-
ny, was turned over to the Chan-
cellor early last week.

«Consisting of thousands of
pages, the report contains the
findings of the investigation of the
c h a r g e s ’ of “pro—Castroism”
launched by State Representative
John T. Walsh (D———McKeesport)
against University associate pro-
fessor of history Robert G. Colod-
ny.

After reviewing the material,
the Chancellor will make a public-
report of his evaluation in the near

In a letter to the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Chancellor stated
that “. . . we will co-operate with
you fully and communicate to you
such action as may be taken based
on the committee’s report.” Rep-
resentative Walsh, however, has
said that the University promised
him a copy of the report as soon
as it was completed. . -

Philip H. Powers, chairman of
the investigating committee and
vice-chancellor in charge of de-
velopment, recently stated, how-
ever, that the University never in-
tended to make the report public.
“We never made any such prom-

ise,” he said.

Panel Discusses Film,

Questions Legitimacy

By JIM HUFNAGEL

A professor of law, an assistant professor of political sci-
ence, and an assistant professor of history met Wednesday
afternoon in the Student Union to discuss one of the more
controversial issues among current affairs.

The occasion was the panel‘ discussion of the ﬁlm “Oper-
tion Abolition” in which Carl Beck, from the political science

department, Henry Foster,
the law school, and Emory Evans,
of the history department, par-
ticipated.

Discussion was primarily cen-
tered, however, around the legi-
timacy of the House Un—American
Activities Committee itself.

The majority view which
evolved from the brief period
devoted to the ﬁlm is perhaps
best summarized by,Dr.' Evan’s
remark, “although I am no au-
thority, my reaction-to the ﬁlm
was that, even if you accept the
position of the committee, the
movie itself was pretty badly
done. It was not even skillfully
put together.”

He then went on to ask “how
do you define loyalty?” and an-
“an individual’s actions
and not his ideas constitute his
loyalty. If ideas are questioned,
democracy ceases.”

Professor Foster then question-
ed the committee’s definition of
“un-American” and observed that
it could “conceivably include the
Klu Klux Klan and the White
Citizens Council as well as left-
wing, communist organizations.”

He cited the recent charges
brought against Dr.
“an instance when a newspaper
has been indecent if not illegal
in supressing constitutional free-
dom.”

Dr. Beck asked “what is the
proper function and behavior of
the House Un-American Activi-
ties Committee? It has present-
ed no legislation. :It has heard
many cases but has offered no
constructive suggestions.”

Foster noted that, “The only
real danger of subversion in the
history of America has come from
right-wing southerners. The Civil
War was outright treason, rebel-

lion and secession which killed

many Americans. The real danger
now '2 from those people
who are resisting, rejecting and
defying law, order, and the con-
stitutional process.

“The 20,000 Communists who
meet in cell groups with the
quorum made. up by an FBI or
CIA agent are piddling nuisances
—initiating but not dangerous. For
this reason I reject the entire
theory behind the HUAC.

Communism is much like ob-
scenity —— the critic’s scapel is
more eﬁective than the censor’s
sword..The HUAC’s interogations
are comparable to banning a book
in Boston —- you make a best
seller out of it.”

Dr. Evans remarked, “I feel
that the reason the HUAC is so
widely accepted is that Ameri-
cans are not very critical of
their way of life. They have
had it good materially for al-
most two centuries now -and feel
that this justiﬁes anything done
in the name of American institu-
tions.”

Probably the liveliest part of
the question period which follow-
ed the discussion occurred when
a woman in the audience asked
the panel to speciﬁcally point out
which parts of the film were
“fantasy,” a term which they had
earlier used.

,Dr. Evans reacted immediately,
saying, “the whole thing was fan-
tasy. The communists didn’t come
in to lead the students! They
were there because they were
subpoenad by the committee. They
had to be there! The episodes
were filmed out of sequence,
omitting many important scenes
which conflict with the commit-
tee’s commentary.

“The tragic part of it is that
people will accept the film with-
out question. They will not see
the flaws in it.”

New H andboolc
For Freshmen
Nears Deadline

Work on the 1961-62 Student
Handbook is progressing toward
a successful completion, accord-
ing to Robert Pannier, editor of
the publication.

The 140 page handbook will be
composed of ﬁve major sections: a
calendar of University events, an
index of student activities, Uni-
versity rules and regulations, a
freshman index, and a section de-
voted to pictures of the incoming
freshmen.

The calendar of events is al-
most completed and Pannier said
that he anticipates no trouble in
meeting the June 1 deadline for
this section.

He reports similar success with
the index of student activities
which is already compiled and
needs only to be typed in print-
able form.

The University_rules and reg-
ulations segment is in the same
situation an the activity index.

Pannier mentioned "that the
stumbling block has been with
the freshman section, both with
the pictures and index. He at-
tributed the difficulty to the fact
that although requests to the
prospective freshmen have been
mailed, few have yet replied.

Earns Title

By BILL DeCARBO

Ira Palmer, a retired member
of the city police, joined the Pitt
Corps in November, 1960, and has
won the title of “a friend” in the
short period that has intervened
since then.

His friendship range extends
from the maintenance members to
students and administrators. Get-
ting along with people is a na-
tural skill for Palmer, however,
and Palmer’s recipe for obtaining
cooperation is just to be nice.

Retiring from the police force
in 1957, Palmer spent three years
in Florida — “just resting,” but
had to return to his old beat,
Pittsburgh, because “his wife
didn’t like the Florida climate.”

A slightly chubby policeman
with full cheeks, Palmer cited
two reasons why working at the
University “is the best job he’s
ever had.” He referred to his
boss, Captain Charles Ray, head
of the security department, as a
“wonderful felow to work for”
—-then he talked about his fa-
vorite subject, students.

“I never have trouble with any

‘Prep Pitt”
A1000 Participate
In Saturday’s
Mock Disaster

By JIM NELSON
“Operation Prep Pitt’ went
into action Saturday at 9 a.m.,
sending a rush of a thousand

maimed, burned, and frac-

tured volunteer disaster cas-
ualties to thirteen area hos-

pitals for emergency treatment.
The exercise stressed the train-
ing of professional personnel in the
management of mass casualties
within the hospitals, under the as-
sumption that during the drill
these institutions are able to ex-
pand their facilities and function
without limitations resulting from
disaster.
Operation Prep Pitt gives
. the hospitals an idea of where
they are lacking in emergency
‘ mobilization, and aids them in

successfully setting up a plan for
mass disasater treatment.

The victims were given their
realistic wounds by a volunteer
make-up crew at the field house
at 8 a.m., and at 9 a.m. were trans-
ported to the various participating
hospitals. Entering through emer-
gency entrances, the patients were
quickly assigned to rooms for
treatment which ranged from sur-
gery to shock treatment.

‘ During the operation an un-
pire committee surveyed the
speed and efficiency of the pa-
tient care in every area of the
hospitals, and camera men ﬁlm-
ed the activities.

Several of the 13 participating
hospitals got'.a delivery of “sur-
prise casualties,” knowing only a
half an hour ahead of time that
some were on the way, but not
knowing the number or when they
would come.

Officially, Prep Pitt is now con-

sidered an'Annua1 Medical-Civil‘

Defense Disaster Drill and is -joint-
ly sponsored by the local sponsors
and the Oﬂice of Civil and Defense
Mobilization. ‘

Lifetime Educatton Philosophy
‘ By JUDY ll/IIEHSILJIK
Viers W. Adams’ personal philosophy is that “it is im-
possible to focus on me Without focusing on my work at the

University.” A

The fact that Adams, dean of the School of General
Studies, has been with the University since he enrolled as
an undergraduate in the School of Education in 1926 bears

witness to this philosophy.

In 1930 Dean Adams received
his MA in educational administra-
tion which prepared him for uni-
versity administration work.

Before 1958, when he assumed
his position as director of exten-
sion programs, Dean Adam was
head of the Johnstown Center of
the University for ten years.

After leaving the Johnstown
Center Dean Adams took a
leave of absence to serve with
the Office of Education’s project
to distribute surplus property
to colleges and universities.

He was laterplaced in charge
of the temporary Ellsworth Cen-
ter, the undergraduate college for
veterans. In assuming this duty
he became Assistant Director of
Extensions. _

In 1958 he succeeded Dr. Frank
W. Shockley as Director of Ex-
tensions. This department is in
charge of all social services in-
cluding civil defense programs,

graphic library and evening and
summer schools.

As proof of the diversity and
importance of his work Dean
Adams has at his assistance: Jane
Woodsmith who is in charge of
certificate courses for career de-
velopment; Mr. Baldwin who is
in charge of the program of spe-
cial student courses to supple-
ment outside work experience;

the degree program for evening
students.

In 1958 the Chancellor recom-
mended the establishment of a
separate School of General Stud-
ies which would place the eve-
ning school ‘under an autonomous
program. Dean Adams was then
appointed head of this new
School.

This new School of the Uni-

and Dr. Walter, who formulates.

versity. will attempt to encour-
age adults to get their degree.
Its program is designed to fa-
cilitate the normal process
which takes an average of ten
years.

Dean Adams feels a special
closeness to the evening student
who he describes as being “more
mature, more highly motivated
and more critical of poor teachers

and methods than the day stu- '

dents.”

Adams greatly admires the per-
serverance of the evening student
who realizes that the continuation
of learning is an important thing
which requires great sacriﬁces to
attain. To Dean Adams “the con--
tinuation of learning must ‘go be-
yond commencement day,” This
fact must be recognized by the
young students of today.

Viers Adams has assigned to
himself the task of promoting‘ this
philosophy of the never ending
quality of education through his
department and the new School
of General Studies.

flagrant disregard of federal law.
When a representative of the

‘ President of the United States

was -beaten viciously by a mob,
the President called Governor
Patterson of Alabama. He was
told that the Governor was un-
available, and no one knew
where he could be reached.

This was more than a personal
snub. This was an affront to the
highest office in this country, for
apparently Gov. Patterson, using
his own Faubusian logic, de-
cided that the sovereignty of the
State of Alabama was more im-
portant than the authority of the
President of the U.S.

Correcting the Peace

The Attorney General was cor-
rect in dispatching Federal
rnarshalls to insure order. Ob-
viously, the Governor of ’Ala-
bama had no desire to keep the
peace, and in fact, incited the
mob by his statement that “the
citizens of this state are so en-
raged that I cannot guarantee
protection for this bunch of rab-
ble-rousers.”

The Governor’s opinion of the
“Freedom Riders” is his own,
and he is entitled to it. But it is
clearly his duty to protect trav-
elers through his state from
harm.

I‘ have my own opinion’ of
the “Freedom Riders,” and it
does not differ radically from
the Governor’s. Their crusade
will not change. the minds of

   

the head will.

Southerners anymore than did
Moses change the mindlof the
Pharoah. They are looking for
trouble, and it is clearly the re-
sponsibility of the different
states to. insure that they do not
find it.
Sublimating the Important
At present, the question of
integration takes on a secondary
interest as far as I am con-
cerned. We have enough trouble

in our foreign affairs without
petty, vote-seeking officials
thumbing their noses at the gov-
ernment’s authority and adding
to our difficulties.

Obviously, this is grist for the
Soviet propaganda mills. But

and that these areas are not.

white. What is ’-important to them
is that the ridiculous traditions
of the pre-Civil War South be
preserved. C

No one is forcingithe South-
erners to like Negroes, and no
one is demanding that whites
and Negroes intermarry. But the
North has practiced integration
for years,_ and yet, those who
wanted to, have still found ways
to discriminate without thumb-
ing theirinoses at the law of the
land. No law can force a white
man to associate with a Negro
if he does not want to do so, but
there is definitely a law that
guarantees the right of equal op-
portunity to all citizens of the
U.S.

Laugh at Their Lossr

When the Southerners display
their Confederate flags, it is very
easy to laugh at them with a
superior air of good-natured in-

dulgence. But inside, they are,

the ones who feel superior be-
cause they still feel that they
are a little better than the rest
of us, and they are a little above
any Federal laws with which
they disagree.

Amish farmers who don’t like
to pay Social Security and
Southerners who don’t want to
send their children to school
with Negroes are not above the
law, and they had better realize
it. If a rap across the knuckles

The Breeze and I . . .-

 

Scooter Commuter

We are a rare breed.

iThe above “We” refers to a rather 'teensy-
weensy bundiof students at this University, myself
included, who daily weave in and out of trafﬁc
lanes _’twixt home and school on dashing iron
chargers known as motorscooters.
It has been accurately computed
that only one out of a zillion Pit-
diots aim these anemic Volks-
wagons around campus, but I
think that they merit ’mention on
these pages._ ,

Piloting a scooter is an ex-
tremely complicated and difﬁcult_
task. This is not due to the
mechanical design of the ma-
chine, which will be described
below, but is a direct result of
the social obligation of the throttle-twisting scooter-
ist. Motorscooters, as do all material objects in
America, have an intrinsic status-symbolism. Be-
fore owning such a machine, I believed that they
actually denoted a lack of status (“He ain’t got
enough greens to buy a car!”), but I was wrong.

So Far Out. It's In

For some inexplicable reason, the motorscooter
carries a unique meaning between its handlebars:
it is suddenly an “in” item. Or it is Continental.
Or it is Beat. Or it is “wiggy.” Or it is “nothing
but nails—tough.” Or it is out of gas.

Whatever the case, the scooterist is commanded
by a subliminal social squeeze to be, at all times
and in all situations, nonchalant.

Being nonchalant is the supreme task of the
single-sparkplug- jockey. He must retain godly al-
lofness when the inky exhaust from the bus in front
of him vomits in his eyes. The tight, faint lip-curl
must remain as he sashays too quickly into the Stu-
dent Union driveway and spins into the Chancellor’s
Chrysanthemums- When he races his engine at a
stop—light to impress the girls on the corner, his
cavalier forelock must not be ruffled as his motor
expires with an indiscreet, overheated burp. When
his toes play peek—a-boo from the front of his
shoes (his best brakes), the scooterist must not
lose the devil-may-care arch in his eyebrows.
Real Cool Ride »_

In short, the motorized charioteer has a tre-

mendous responsibility to both the trusty hunk of

steel beneath his sitting apparatus and to his
glance-shooting audienceof pedestrians: keep cool,
stay sauve, act aloof. But damﬁno why. .

It is now time to turn the attention away from
the driver and direct it to that which is driven.
Scooters are a rare breed of machinery themselves.
For a bit of background, motorized cycles were ﬁrst
invented 44 ‘years ago, by Leander Scooterinventor
(1521-1531). Today, all of the machines are appar-

ently manufactured used, for nobody has even been

known to purchase a brand-new job. Many scooters
are of foreign font, and this is important. Mysteri-
ously, putt-putts built in this country are con-
sidered ‘.‘out,” while those built ‘but of this country
are usually “in.” This does not mean that one must
go out to be “in.” There are enough “in” machines
in this country, as well as some good “out” ones,
to be classed‘_“way out” enough to be really “in.”
Inexorably. ’

Now that the motorscooter has been adequately
deﬁned, the operation of the vehicle remains to be
explained. At ﬁrst glance, starting a scooter ap-
pears to be only possible for a person with four
pairs of hands and at least three graces of feet. This

is correct.
But you try. Fortunately, your scooter is ac-
companied by an instruction manual. Unfortu-

nately, being an “in” job, the manual is written in
either Italian, ‘German, French or Albanian.

But you try. By a stroke of luck, you happen to
be majoring in Albanian. This trimester. At any
rate, you begin. Approach the beast with caution,
‘as they are known to snap out when provoked,
Straddle the foam or leather section, which is
called the seat, and grip the handle-grips, which
are called handle-grips. Start acting nonchalant.

, Some of these noise-makers have what is known
as an ignition key, but some do not. As this key is
generally lostanyway, we will not concern our-
selves with it. Frustrating, no?

Non-peaceful Resistance ,

But you try. Locate the kickstarter, on the side

of the scooter. This has the same, function as the

pull-cord on a power lawnmower. But do not be,

fooled; you are to kick it. So kick it already. As
you will notice, immediately after you depress the
kickstarter, it ﬂies back up and slams you soundly
‘on the ankle. It has a spring. After you wash the
blood away (from the ankle, not the spring), have
your mother rub a little butter on the welt and you
should stop crying in a few minutes.

But you try. After you ﬁnally get the hang of
kicking over the engine (70. or 80 times should do
it), catch it by revving the throttle, which is hidden
someplace in the handlegrip. Or should be. You
~will notice that you are not moving; this is prob-
ably due to the fact that you are idling in neutral.
This can be fun, but most drivers prefer to use their
scooters for traveling, too.

So youtry. Your next step is to shift into ﬁrst
gear. Activate the clutch, which may be located
either on. the handlebars or-on the runningboards,
depress your shift lever, which may be located
either on the handlebars or on the runningboards,
and be sure that your brake is not on. This can
be easily located either ‘on the handlebars or on
the runningboards. Also, check your main gas line,
and the main gas line of‘ the scooter as well.

So Frustrating, the Gears Flow

The above directions may seem somewhat con-
fusing. If you cannot locate the gears, which is not
surprising, you are permitted to drive your scooter
down hills in neutral. This can be fun and it still
gives the impression that you are a full-ﬂedged
scooter commuter.

However, with a bit of luck and a good deal of
gumption, a few scooterists have been known to
‘master the manual gearshifting within a few
months. «

So you try. You have shifted gears andxare set .

to go. Byjfeeding in a‘ little gas and slowly letting
out the clutch, the tires are turning and you are
driving. ~Now that you are really driving, you can
appreciate the beauty of the machine: the sensa-
tion of warm sunshine on your back, the wind
chuckling through your hair, the straining power
of the scooter at your ﬁngertips.

You will notice, however, that you are riding in
a small, tight circle. Before you become too dizzy,
you remember that you forgot to undo the wheel-
lock, which holds your front tire at a 90—degree
angle. Riding this way is acceptable, too, but not
for commuter purposes.

As thekey is nonexistent, you are already four
hours late for class, you have no alternative. Catch
that bus! ‘

Lectures Praised

Editor, The Pitt News:

The other day while nosing
through my desk, sorting out the
junk and old papers, I ran across
a handbill proclaiming a series
of lectures sponsored by_ the
Chinese Language and Area
Center.

I see where three out of ﬁve
listed have already taken place.
Having listened to the last talk
by Lord Lindsay and heard
nothing but favorable reports on
the former two, I must conclude
that this is a worthwhile pro-

gram being undertaken by the"

Chinese studies department.
What is remarkable is that
this area of study was founded
only last year and already it is
doing more than its share in in-

to the layman. The department
more than fulfills its stated goal
of promoting a wider. under-
standing of present day China in
relation to her past.

Prior to attending Lindsay’s
lecture I knew little or nothing
about China’s,government. The
talk was ill-attended. If people
around this university would

become addicts, seeking to know
more.

With the need increasing ev-
eryday whereby we should un-
derstand our Oriental neighbors
this series can do much in the
way of enlightening a clouded
area in the minds of the public-

Marxism, the continuity

Lord Lindsay of Birker, pro-
fessor of Far Eastern Studies at
American University, discussed

this dual philosophy of change»

and continuity last Wednesday at
the third lecture in a series of
ﬁve sponsored by the Chinese
Language -and Area center.

In a crisp, concise British ac-
cent, Lindsay devoted the major
portion of the discussion period to
the continuity hypothesis which
draws an analogy between the
function of the communist party‘
in modern China and the ruling
elite in the imperial dynasties of
traditional China. ,

Legalistic Uniﬁcation

Lindsay explained that even
before the uniﬁcation of China
in 230 B.C. by the Legalistic
regime of the Chin dynasty, the
large states within the territory
were quite bureaucratic, much
more than the feudal states in
Europe. Each state was highly
centralized by the elite with cen-
sors capable of enforcing con-
scription and mobilizing armies.

China's total uniﬁcation by
the Chin dynasty brought with it
the ﬁnishing touches of the gov-
ernment’s totalitarian structure.

During this period, imperialist
officials of the Legalistic regime
smothered the Confucian ideal,
stamped out all other conflicting
ideas, quietly removed any gov-
ernment critic and exalted the
state to an unprecedented level.
The similarity between the struc-
ture of this regime and the pre-
sent communistic regime is re-
markable, Lindsay added.

He stated that although the
Confucian ideals eventually over-
threw the forceful ideals of this
regime, the Legalistic’s institutions
and structures remained.

Amateur Oﬁicials

“The influence of the Confu-
cian element was strong enough
to make some officials stand up
against higher officials,” he said,

Speaker States Analogy Between Past, Present

if Lindsay Tees   hina’s Elite

LORD LINDSAY OF BIRKER, Pr

 

ofessor of Far Eastern Studies at

American University, in his lecture last lvednesday drew an analogy
between the function of the communist party in modern China and
the ruling elite of traditional China.

“This produced the effect of mod-
erated force.”

In addition,- the Confucian
element created the whole tra-
dition of officials being amateurs
—amateur in the sense that they
were more concerned with per-
sonal cultural developments.

“But even though you did not
have a forceful totalitarion gov-
ernment,” he added quickly, “all
power rested with the elite. Pow-
er in China has never depended
on ownership,of property, but on
political status in the state.”

In order to remove any doubt
in the audience’s mind about the
continued maintenance of the
bureaucratic ideology, Lindsay
pointed out the role the mongols
played in 1200 A.D. when they
visited Russia and helped them
establish a bureaucratic system of
taxation and militaristic practices.
This basis grew into the Czarist
regime in Russia.

Shepard Protecting Sheep

Lord Lindsay then concentrated
his attention on “why China has
returned to the Legalistic type
government of 230 B.C. He said
that-the Chinese people have liv-
ed under an authoritarian mili-
taristic form of government for
over 2,000 years where mutual
conﬁdence in enforcing law did
not exist.. Also the elite have
thought of the people as a flock
of sheep, surviving only when the
shephard protected them.

“When ‘the old imperialistic
system disappeared with the
overthrow of the Manchu dyn-

r asty in 191l,” he said, “the lack
of a base resulted in any one
ruling who could.”

Although Sun Yat-sen might

have succeeded in helping China
“become modernized,” he died
and his followers did not carry
out his plan.

The present government offi-
cials are doing the same thing
that the elite of Chin dynasty
did in 230 B.C. According to
Lindsay they are trying to de-
stroy traditional cultural ele-
ments. By removing Confucianism
from the government’s philosophy,
one is left with only the highly
developed bureaucracy familiar to
the people.

He concluded by saying that
there were periods in the l9<l0’s
and in 1957, when leading officials
questioned the number of com-
munist leaders in government, but
the government now rests com-
pletely in the hands of the ex-
tremists.

Lord Lindsay’s experiences with
the Chinese include teaching at
Yenching University in Peiping
from 1937 to 1940, various serv-
ices for the Chinese government
during conflicts with Japan dur-
ing the same period, and served
as technical advisor to the Chinese
Army’s Communications Depart-
ment during the Chinese civil war.

He was educated» at Balliol Col-
lege, Oxford, in the Honors School
of Philosophy, Politics and Exo-
nomics with a major in Econom-
ics. i

Drop - Outs
Hurt Team-

If the old adage holds true that
pitcher’s can’t hit, then Pitt’s dia-
mond ropes are less than nil, for

the Cat’s displayed a lineup last
Saturday that was stocked with
no less than three pitchers. Kent
State proceeded to deal them
their ﬁfth loss in a row in a rous-
ing 9-2‘ fashion.

The influx of hurlers perform-
ing Spartan duty was caused by
the departure of Panther stal-
jwarts Pete Suder and Al Riccuit-
ti. The two inﬁelders both drop-
*ped all of their spring trimester
courses and are ineligible for ac-
tion. -

A human howitzer called Harry
Kalbuagh bombed Pitt’s hopes
quickly on Saturday as he blasted
a homerun and a triple at Forbes
Field to pace the Ohians attack
with ﬁve rbi’s. “I’m telling you,”
Coach Bob Lewis emphatically re-

‘ marked, spicing his conversation

with superlatives, “this kid really
hit two shots. Hepulled an out-
side pitch over the 405 mark,
and lined another ball to the
monument in centcrﬁeld, 457 feet
away.”

The blitzkreig completed a week
in which the Panthers have fallen
prey to shellshock. They were also
blistered by Slippery_Rock, 12-2.
and West Virginia, 11-4. As a re-
sult, their record is now 4-8.

Lewis’ squad is now down to 13
players as Frank Ignaczak also
dropped his courses recently. “I
don’t blame those kids,” Lewis
commented. “They’re good boys,
but they just can’t keep up with
their work. They miss too many
classes and with our accelerated
program, they can’t afford to.”

“You know that there are no
dumb kids at Pitt. The entrance
standards are tough, and our boys
are taking tough lab courses and
math and such. We don’t have
any basket weaving or surf board
riding classes.” S

To makeamatters worse, beside
the drop-outs, Lewis also had his
forces further depleted by two in-
juries. Captain Jerry Matulevic
suffered a broken jaw against
Penn State and he is out for the
season. His replacement, Bob

Football Team Gauges 1961
Squads’ Strongpoints, Flaws

Maybe baseball is in season but many of the Pitt foot-

ball players are looking ahead

to the 1961 campaign.

Athletic Director Frank Carver feels it’s going to be an
interesting team. “Those sophomores are going to make the
difference,” said Carver. “It’s hard to say how many games
we will win. Nobody knows that but it will be an inter-

esting team. Those guys are full$
of vim and vigor and that makes
a big diﬁerence.” S ‘

The big difference between the
1960 and 1961 teams will be the
fight for the positions. “Last year
everybody knew who the ﬁrst
team was,” said one assistant
‘coach. This spring, everybody was
‘ﬁghting for a berth. That’s good.”

Pitt’s collapse in 1960 can be
attributed to one thing—a weak
second unit. The ﬁrst team av-
eraged 44 minutes a game the
latter part of the campaign. The

“I’m really disgusted,” Lewis
sighed. “Our kids can take losses,
but not humiliation. We’re beaten
before we start anymore. We get
bombed in the initial innings, and
never recover.

“Our pitching is our "biggest
problem. We can’t hold them
close, and we lack the manpower
to get back in the game. This may
all sound like sour grapes, but I
really don’t know. Maybe it’s the
coaching, I don’t kne;o“~v.”

Elbowing Good For Conditioning, Referee Says

Panthers, however, will have to
improve its offense to offset a
weaker defense which yielded
just 77 points. “Our passing at-
tack will have to improve,” said
Coach John Michelosen. That
could be the key to a successful
season. I thought we had a good
spring practice and was im-
pressed by the spirit of the
team.” '
One of the most optimistic play-

ers on the team is center Andy

Kuzneski. “We are going to fool
everybody. This team has more
desire than the other two I played
on,” said the senior star. “If we
can get off to a good start, that can
make the difference. Maybe we
might lose a fewsgames but I still
think we can have a good year.”

Although the 1961 Pitt team
might not win the national cham-
pionship, it could prove to be the
most interesting team since the
days of Lou “Bimbo” Cecconi who
ran wild for the Panthers in the
late forties.

ginia athletic publicity director,

was in an accident this winter
and some of the Mountaineer
players were slightly hurt, one of
the Pitt players remarked, “It
should have been last year right
before our game and Jerry West
should have been hurt just
enough to miss just our game.”

Toughest schedules: St. Louis

and. Penn State. The latter team
played just eight games on its
own ﬂoor. The stars of the fu-
ture: Roger Brown of Dayton,
Connie Hawkins of Iowa, Nash
of Kentucky and Willie Somer-
set of Duquesne.

Most lonely man: The guy who
has _to watch Elgin Baylor. At
one, "basketball game in New
York, the crowd was announced
at 8,000. A local writer wrote,

“The crowd was announced as
8,000. Apparently 5,000 came dis-
guised as seats.

Best Fight: Kansas vs. Mis-
souri. The perfect basketball lead:
Scoring in every period.

National Past Time

The Basketball Writers have
suggested that the NCAA play the
championship game either on Sat-
urday afternoon or earlier in the-
evening. Many papers are not able
to carry much on the ﬁnal game,
especially if the game is played
in the Middle West or Far West.
After the fourth overtime in the
Utah-St. Joseph’s game, somebody
remarked, “Well, it’s well past my
edition time now.” Ray Cave of
Sports Illustrated said, “It's past
mine too.”

Best remark by a fun. A Cin-
cinnati rootcr _said, “Before we
played Ohio State they were the
greatest team in the history of
basketball. After we won, they
were just the second best team
in Ohio.’f

Tennis Team‘ Splits;
Douglass Injured

Bad Back Catches Up With Netter
After West Virginia Defeat, Victory

Pitt’s tennis team beat West Virginia and Ibst to Frank-

lin & Marshall last week, but

in the win over WVU they

probably suffered the greater loss.

In the 5-4 conquest of the Mounties the Cats lost the
services of one of their outstanding players. Jack Douglass
for the remainder of the season. It seems as though the

game little netter has been play-5
ing on nerve alone during the past
few weeks.

The back injury that has
plagued Douglass throughout the
season was diagnosed as far more
serious than had earlier been
thought. After he lost his ﬁrst
singles match of the year to Bob
Morgan, in heartbreaking style,
8-6, 7-5, Douglass came back to
team with Joe Brown in doubles
play to score the Panthers’ ﬁfth
and decisive point over Buzz Rag-
land and Jim Bibbee, 8-6, 13-11.

At the end of the match
. Douglass could barely walk and

had to be assisted from the court
by his teammates. Upon his re-
turn to Pittsburgh, trainer How-
ard VVaite declared that Doug-
lass was suffering from throm-
bophlibitis.

Only Brown and Glaser were

able to cop wins againt Frank-
lin & Marshall. They each won

their singles matches then got to-
gether to produce a third point in
doubles play. _

Coach Bill Summers was some-
what miffed about the circum-
stances surrounding Douglass’s de-
feat. The West Virginia coach
dropped his second man, Morgan,
into the third spot so that Doug-
lass would be facing a tougher
opponent. than be normally
would. The regular number three
man, Bibbee, was moved into the
second spot in the hope that he
could defeat O’Loughlin.

Although the strategy didn't
work since O’Loughlin won, Sum-
mers was mad at “the unethical,
bush league actions" of the
Mountie coach.

BS’ JACK SMITH

It is always interesting for me to look back at the end of an
athletic year at Pitt’s achievements in sports. Although there are
bound to be some objections to my choices, I feel the following are
the outstanding athletesand events in 1960-61. Included in the list

are prophecies for next year.

TOP ATHLETE-——Mike Ditka, All-American end, for his outstanding
play on the Panther’s football team.

OUTSTANDING COACH—Rex Perry, whose wrestling teams have

been consistent winners.

BEST INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE——Larry Lauchle, wrestler, who
copped the NCAA mat title at 130 pounds.

BIGGEST UPSET——-The football team’s 10-0 victory over Syracuse.

TOP ATHLETE AND SCHOLAR—-Soccer player Cal Smith who
maintained a 3.65 QPA in Engineering. ‘

MOST HEARTBREAKING SEASON-—The football team’s 4-3-3.

record. Five games were decided by one point.
LEAST PUBLICIZED TEAM——»The Rifle team.
WORST TEAM PERFORMANCE—-The track team’s 10-4-27 loss

to Maryland.

MOST UNDERRATED ATHLETE——Jim Cunningham, Panther foot-
ball fullback who was one of the team’s best offensive and

defensive men.

BIGGEST FACILITY IMPROVEMENT-—The new asphalt ﬂoor and
indoor board track in the Field House.
BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO SPORTS—-Horse Czarneckie, Pitt’s

energetic grounds keeper.

MOST NEEDED IMPROVEMENT—Scholarships for minor sports.
BIGGEST DISAPPOlNTMENT—-No athletic rooters.
TEAM OF THE FUTURE——l963 Basketball team.

BEST ATHLETE OF THE FUTURE-—Corky Cuthbert who is center-V

forward on the soccer team and leading scorer, and second base-

man on the baseball team.

MOST PROMISING FRESI-IMEN TEAM—-The frosh basketball team
that compiled a 13-4 record this year.

MOST PROMISING FRESHMAN——Brian Generalovich, 6-5 center,
who led the frosh basketball team this year.

 

Body Balance and Position be-
fore moving to the ball.

Again our stress is simplicity
and ease of operation in tennis.

There is one position in tennis
that is very important. even be-
fore attempting to stroke a ball.
That position is the “get-set” po-
sition, the ready position which
Bredge calls the anticipatory po-
sition. It is used between each
shot you make.

Let’s go into just how it is done.
First ﬁnd a good—sized mirror so
you can see yourself in action.
Facing the mirror set your feet

about 12 to 18 inches apart and
adjust them comfortably.

Next bend your knees a bit,
keep your back straight, and
head up-—eyes front. Now relax
in this position. Next, extend
your arms in front of your body
holding your racquet in your
right hand supporting the throat
of the racquet with the left
hand. I

Now relax. Weight should be
forward ready to move to your
opponent’s shot.

See you on the courts.

Next: The forehand stroke.

Coach Proud of Showing

Coach George Underwood’s
golfers closed out their season
with a victory and a defeat. The
win was over St. Vincent, last
Monday, and the loss was to West
Virginia, the following day. The
split gave the linksmen a 6-9-1
record for the year.

An oddity occurred against St.
Vincent when Ron Dermitt scor-
ed the low round of the day, 71,
but still lost his match to Bill
Del Veccio, 21/2 to 1/2. Del Veccio
shot a 73 but came out the better
under match play rules.

Stew Snodgra.ss and Jack Ves-
selemy each scored three points
for the Cats. Dale Long and Neil
Shorthouse tallied 11/2 points each
and Dan Swanson chipped
with one.

In best ball play the teams of
Dermitt and Snodgrass and Ves-
selany and Long each garnered a
point to make the Panthers’ 12
points.

SC Considers
Changes In

Constitution

The possibility of revising the
Student Government Constitution
was dlSC‘.lSS€Cl at the second meet-
ing of the summer Senate last
Wednesday.

The proposed revision, which is
to be studied further, would have
the President of SG act as Presi-
dent of the Senate and also be a
voting member. '

While the summer Senate can-
not itself legislate, it has under
consideration in committee many
matters of importance to the stu-
dents.

It is presently contacting other
universities which have honor
codes to determine the possibil-
ity of establishing one here.

Also under consideration is the
revival of ID Cards. The Athletic
Department, the Student Union
and other departments have com-
plained that unauthorized person-
nel are taking advantage of those
privileges reserved for University
students.

In addition SG is keeping a
close watch on developments in
the clothing code area, is attempt-
ing to establish early sponsorship
and dress regulations for the X-
Mass Ball, and is requesting two
new advisors to replace DI‘.
Schwartzbaugh and Janice Hoyer
who are leaving in June.
