said, to insinuate that anybody wasf
involved in graft for “we could easily

Three things .happened last week
that show signs -of-an awakened stu-
dent body at Pitt. ‘ D

University authorities for a student
discussion of the men’s government
problem. ‘ Somethingwas accomplish-
ed———as is always the case when at-
tention is focused upon a condition
.-that needs improvement. We will
soon see further fruits of that woe-
fully necessary get-together. 7 v’
’ The second thing to happen was the
action taken at the recent Junior class
meeting, sbowingevidence of a de-
sire-on the part -ot students to break
the traces and remove any stigma of
commercialism from their activities.
Nullifying the action of ‘a previous
meeting when -a large part of the
PIrom‘pr_oﬂts wasvoted to the,'chair-
man of the" dance,“ the class broke
away from the precedent of allowing
the leader of the University’s pre-
miere social event to participate in
the proﬁtsaccruing from it, and cre-
ated fa ~mem.oria.-l fund from the pro-»
ceeds to be used later for worthy. pur-
poses. " V - - T
The other happening of the week
was the admission by George. Lynch,
President of ‘the. Student Council, to
this ,writer,%that our criticism of ‘the
Student Council was not unjustiﬁed
and the avowal of a determination to
remedy that condition. '  ' ‘
What three things could be‘ more
indicative of an awakened student in-
terest in the welfare of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh?

' The ‘Student Council came to life
with the appointment of the‘ election
commit_tee.— Mr. Lynch promises to
keep italive if he has to incur the
animosity of every student at Pitt.
That is the proper spirit-—one that
will surely be productive of some-
Aihing worth while.‘ - -
We,- asked Mr. flﬁynch what, he.

We happened to be a spectator at

which the Freshman nine fell before
that of Schenley High School. We
were interested in, the happenings of

ter the game, ‘it was, mentioned that

commendable record and it’s a« shame
that it had to be broken. He may be
well comforted (and the student
knockers who are moaning aboutthe

by ren'1embering that the Schenley
game is. the first of the season. Then.
too, theidea of a Ereshman te‘ ll in
any sport at any school is not  win
games but to ﬁnd men and ifthey
are not to be -found. to develop them.

when Hill and Brown singled and
Parsons was hit. Lefty tried to come

Game Pitdters’ Duel. . _

The game was a real pitchers’ duel with
both ‘Part and Swetonic working in a_r_e-
markable early season form. Each ‘had eight
strikeouts to his credit and each was guilty
of issuing two passes, Steve gained the e_cL2_‘e
on his rival. when_ Tart put two of _P1tta
inch on base by hitting them with pitched

, balls. Swetonic was backed up with ‘faultless
gsupporb---a wonderful thing considering that
: it was the ﬁrst game for the ,Panthers. Tarr—'a

mates committed two misplays. _

With two out and the prospect of gems
into. extra innings seeming to be in order,
Jakie Bohren, hero of many afootball strug-
gle, decided to -bring. the game to a close by
sending a pretty single over second. Spike
Harding came to bat. He struck at two of
Tarr’s pitches and allowed Jakie to steal sec-
ond. Then, to atone for the hard luck, he
ha.d'a.t bat earlier in the game. he knocked a
sizzling liner to right center. Bohren romped
home from second with the winning counter.

The entire Pi-tt team comes in for a word
of -praise for its excellent work. Bohren
made several circus catches in left ﬁeld. while
“I4efty" played his usual bang‘-up game at
first. Spike Harding showed up good at
short and Nick Lauder behind the bat.
