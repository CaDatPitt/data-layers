Duchess Wins Praise

by MARTY LIEBOWITZ
The plays of John Webster, al-
though inconsistent in many
ways, can be fullﬁlling theatrical
experiences when well-perform-

-  The University Theater pro-

duction of the Duchess‘of Malﬁ

is one example of such a pheno-

menon.

The Duchess, now playing at
Stephen Foster Memorial, tells of
the widowed Duchess of Malﬁ,
who is forbidden by her brothers
to remarry. She does ‘ remarry,
however, and is eventually mur-
dered by her brother, Ferdinand.

We are never told why her
brothers are against remarrying,
but this is not important to the
play. What is important is the
character development, the at-

‘mosphere created, as well as
-' Webster’s dialogue.

The two brothers, one a Duke
and the other a Cardinal, are op-
posing character types. The Duke
is a madman— easily excitable
and unpredictable. In contrast,
the Cardinal is calm and self-as
sured.

James Berry as Ferdinand, the

_ Duke, approaches his part ex-

tremely well, although he some-
times spoke too fast. His poise
was a bit affected.

‘ Dan Frezza, as the Cardinal,
likewise performed well, although

‘ he did not appear as strong-

wil_led as his part demanded.

Wanda Lee Henshaw, as the
Duchess, performed with a grace
and manner rarely seen in stu-
dent productions. Hers is a dif-
ﬁcult role, and contains many
varied moods.

John Krich, as Bosola, per-
forms his role with a naturalness
and mastery worthy of praise.‘
Throughout the play his presence
on stage is enough to alleviate
any shortcomings on the part of
the other actors.

Harvey Miller as Antonio ef-
fectively portrays a subservient
individual. The dialogue between
Antonio and Bosola in Act 2,
Scene 3, is stunning. It is both
clear and sharp on the part of
both actors and leads to a homo-
genous interaction between the
two.

People of the‘ 17th Century

went to Lunatic Asylums for’
. amusement. Therefore, Webster’s

inclusion of a scene involving
.madmen is not strange. The pro-
duction of this “mad scene” is
"nightmarish, and alone worth the
price of a ticket.

The students and staff mem-
bers of the University Theatre re-
sponsible for the production of
Duchess should be congratulated
for their exceptional handling of
a difficult play. It is exciting and
suspenseful, a worthwhile experi-
ence to see.

N. Texas State Questions
Validity of College Exams

Associated Collegiate Press

Do exams defeat the purpose

'_ of education? This question was
recently asked by the North Tex-

as’State University Campus Chat.
The Campus Chat says, “They

1; ._.are not an infallible measure of a
student's academic ability,

nor
do they prompt the student to
develop his talents and interests

, to the fullest, but because pro-
—- fessors place such great emphasis
 on the outcome of exams, the

student begins to play a guessing
game—what will the professor

 have on the tests?”

Two students may converse.
“Don’t read chapter
nine. George had Professor Smith
last term and he said there are

e no questions from that chapter.”

“Thanks,” his friend may re-
ply. “By the way, I heard he
asks only general questions, so
don’t bother memorizing speci-
fics.” A
Meanwhile, a third student may
be selling copies of last year’s

I  test.

Like computers, these students,

         

tend to spit back memorized
knowledge while their own ideas
decay. They don’t have time to
develop their own ideas because

-they’re too busy playing the

guessing game, the report sug- \
gests. Such a system defeats the
purpose of higher education. .

The report suggests that pro-
fessors assign more papers and
have fewer exams. Students would
use their own ideas rather than
memorizing someone else’s. “The
elimination of tests would make

courses more enjoyable, more in- ‘

teresting and more meaningful
for teacher and student,” the re-
port summarizes.

Commuter Association

 

   

Group Discusses Supplement

by NAN ISEN

The Commuter Association dis-
cussed a proposed printed supple-
ment on commuter life at the
University at Monday’s meeting
in the SU

Ron Cowell, chairman of the
group, stated that the supple-
ment would, “Make the general
university more aware of com-
muter problems, and to make the
commuter more interested in
helping himself.” Forums on com-
muter problems and student apa-
thy would be included in such a
project, according to the chair-
man.

In reference to the ever pre-
sent parking problem, Cowell
suggested a student run survey
to discover who really uses the
parking spaces around the Cathe-
dral of Learning. At last month’s
parking forum, Anthony Mis_ci-
marra, a city traﬁic engineer,
stated that these spaces were

used primarily by people staying
in Oakland for short errands.
Cowell contends that students use
the spaces, and if this can be
proven, the installation of long
term parking meters may result.

The establishment of car pools
was also discussed. Cowell said
that cards will be kept in a box
at the desk on the CL ground
ﬂoor. Those willing to give rides

would ﬁll these cards with their
name, address, number of spaces
available, and the times they de-
part for and leave from school.
Students wishing rides can then
check these cards and contact the
driver.

Cowell urged that anyone in-
terested in working on various
Commuter Association projects
call him at 823-5633.

candidacy and restarted to the

of course, was so “in,” such a
revered liberal, that it became
just too, too chic to picture Gold-
water as some foam-in-the-mouth
demagogue/madman who would
lead the country down multiple
paths to destruction.

This was so much rubbish that
the American public immediately
believed it. Any real study of

Dear Klide S. Scope,

“My boy friend has gotten into
the habit of watching Fri. and
Sat. nights at the Movies on tele-
vision. Can you suggest any way
of getting him out to the Scope
on those nights?

Thanks,
CUDDLES.

’Dear Cuddles,

-You have until December 9, to
break him of this nasty habit.
For openers you might try .point-
ing out to him that watching those
old movies on T.V. is hard on
the eyes, and a vicarious way of
seeking pleasure at best.

If you haven't succeeded by the
afternoon of Dec. 9, call me and
I'll have a couple of T.V. Anony-
mous members over to straighten
him out.

Good luck,
KLIDE S. SCOPE.

Dear K lide,

I recently "sent in my question-
naire to “Data Mate" and guess
what? The computer says we are
meant for each other!!! I know
this is hard for you to believe,
being a man of the world and all

. . . . but computers don't lie, do

they?

I'm really looking forward to
meeting you on Dec. 9 when you
open your “total environment
night club.” And Klide, please
be kind.

Love and Kisses,
SASSY FRASS.

P.S.': You'll know me by my Pus-
chia colored mini skirt and Pur-
ple High heeled sneakers.

Dear Sassy,
WHAT color is Puschia???

Dear Klide S. Scope,

Be prepared to meet me on
opening night, I’m really hot. Be-
fore you came into the picture
Jezzie was happy with me. I'd
take her to a show or gin mill
once or twice a week and she'd
think she really had a blast. Now
you start this “Mind Thing” with
all those lights, music and color
and she tells me you have class
and imagination and she's going
to spend her weekends at your
place, It’s not that I mind that so
much, but since she joined this
Scope of yours she says I can't
even come as her guest.

Respectfully,
FIGHT MAD.

Dear Fight Mad,

‘ Don’t be disgruntled. I believe
Jezzie is just putting you on in
hope you'll become a member too.
It should put your mind at ease
to know that you don't have to
join Scope to enjoy it—just bring
an extra $1.00 with you (Total
$2.00) and you and Jezzie can
explode together.

Dear Klide s. Scope,

The one thing I want is will
there be Chow and stuff available
or do I have to pack a basket?

FOOD FOR THOUGHT.

Dear Foo dfor Thought,

You can bring a basket if you
want to, but I think you'll find
our pizza, hamburgers, hoagies,
etc. worth thinking about.

Dear Mr. Scope,

Is it true that your club is fea-
turing a botique with all the
latest “In styles (Mod and Mini
Clothes). If so I would like to
apply for a job as a model. My
measurements are 38%, 22.

Breathlessly yours,
LOTTA.

Um, yes my dear Lotta its all
true. Since reading your enlight-
ening note, I’ve arranged just
such a botique. Mr. Brostoff of
Carnaby Square is putting in a
grouping of the latest “IN” fash-
ions from London. May I suggest
that we get together at the earli-
est possible moment to further
discuss the dimensions you men-
tioned.

Dear Mr. Scope,

In the Nov. 4th issue of this

ment “A Scope in Time saves 9.”
Have you started a new religion
or does this have a deeper signi-
cance that may have escaped me?

Dear I.R.,

No, we are not starting a new
religion. Your uncertainty stems
from the fact that the statement
contains a typographical error. It
should read “A Scope in Time
saves 10.”

Rochester
Institutes
“Pass-Fai ”

Rochester, N. Y. (I.P.) —
More than one out of three
undergraduates in the Uni-
versity of Rochester’s Col-
lege of Arts and Science used
the College’s new “satisfac-

tory-fail” option in choosing ’

their courses in the spring
semester of 1966, according to a
reported released by the largest
academic unit of the University.

The new system permits un-
dergraduates in the College of
‘Arts and Science to take one
course in which they receive no
grade except “satisfactory” or
“fail.” According to ﬁgures re
leased, ‘304 freshmen, 277 sopho-
mores, 211 juniors, and 169 sen-
iors elected to take an ungraded
course. These represented 36 per
cent of the freshmen, 36 per; cent
of the sophomores, 42 per cent of
the juniors, and 39 per cent of
the seniors in the College of Arts
and Science. _ I

The new system was initiated,
on this campus as a means of
reducing the pressure for grades
and encouraging students to ex-
plore a wider range of subjects.
The option was adopted after fac-
ulty and undergraduate commit-
tees had studied similar plans on
other campuses.

The ﬁelds which enrolled the
largest number of undergrad-
uates on the “satisfactory-fail”
option, according to the report,
were English, foreign and com-

- parative literature, history, math-

ematics, and philosophy.

The individual courses most
frequently selected on this basis
were primarily in the humanities;
the top ﬁve were English and
American Masterpieces (elected
by 60 students on an ungraded
basis), Archtypes, a comparative
literature course (also elected by
60 students), Masterpieces of Eur-
opean Literature (50 students),
American Intellectual History
(45 students), and General Bio-
logy (45 students).

Students enrolled in more than
130 different courses in 34 ﬁelds

~‘ on an ungraded basis. (Unlike

the situation here, freshmen at
Princeton University, which in-
troduced a similar system last
year, showed less inclination to
take an ungraded course than
other students, according to an
article in The New York Times.
At Princeton about three-quarters
of the undergraduates elected an
ungraded course.)

Under the new system ‘at Ro-
chester, students may take one
course on an ungraded basis each
term; however, the course may
not be in the students’ major
ﬁeld of study. ‘

(The University of Pittsburgh
Liberal Arts Cabinet has recently
suggested “free electives on a
pass-fail basis to James Kehl,
dean of the School of Liberal
Arts. The proposal, limits free
electives to sophomores, juniors,
and seniors, and provides that a
student may take only two courses
of his college career on this basis.)

ALLOCATIONS DEADLINE

Because ‘new rules for the al-
location of Student Activities
Funds must -be approved by
Student Government tonight,
applications for ‘funds for the

able until tomorrow. Applica-
tions can be obtained at 156

Texas Ai&M 

Confronts A

 Censorship

“The question of censorship
arose at Texas A&M University
recently when the University as-
sumed the role of publisher of

v the campus newspaper, The Bat-
’ talion.

Besides a masthead change list-
ing Texas A&M as publisher,
there was another change in
which Jim Lindsey, director of
student publications and the
school's news and information
service, was listed as editor-in-
chief. In addition, Lindsey’s_ as-
sistant was listed as assistant edi-

C ' tor, and Tommy De Frank, for-
’ mer editor-in-chief, was listed as

student editor.
The changes followed a recent

' series of events. On Sept. 21, a

letter to the editor critical of
A&M’s ex-students’ association
appeared, signed “A Vet’s Wife.”
On Sept. 22, Lindsey was report:
ed to have censored a front page
lead story on the organization of
a political forum, and to have
banned further letters to the edi-
tor on the grounds that the Sept.
21 letter was unsigned and _-in-

I accurate.

Several days later, on Sept. 27,
the Board of Directors‘ issued a

resolution saying that “policies-

pertaining to student publications
are matters to be handled within
the structure of the University
administration.” This meeting re-
sulted in the masthead change
regarding the publisher.

At the Board meeting, Earl Rud-
der, president ‘of the school, was
reportedly held to make minor
policy revisions, but De Frank
claimed Rudder called the "meet-
ing to give the Board power to
ﬁre him.

Rudder claimed that there is
no censorship at Texas A&M.
When asked before the meeting
whether criticism of the adminis-
tration would be allowed under
the current set-up, Rudder re-
plied, “Who is the publisher?

--Would you take the publisher to
task? All I’m saying is that this
newspaper will be run like a pro-
fessional newspaper.”

AID Gives
Textbook

The School of Education re-
cently donated 400 textbooks to
the Curriculum Laboratory of the
University Library. These were
obtained for a research project
contracted with the Agency for
International Development to re-
view and select the best US text-
books for elementary and sec-
ondary schools.

The Curriculum Laboratory is
an exhibit collection of elemen-
tary and secondary textbooks and
syllabi. It is housed in the Re-

‘Playing for fun,’ Paul Killian
Gashes Eye While Blocking

Meaningless Punt in

by JAY ROSENSTEIN

It took a dozen stitches to
sew up the gash under Paul
Ki1lian’s right eye. Admitted‘
ly injuries are the occupational
hazard of a football player and
cuts and bruises are more com-
mon than anything else.

But Killian’s case is different.
Picture the situation. Miami has
rolled up a 38-6 lead with about
ten seconds remaining in the
game. The Panther defense man-
ages to force the Hurricanes to
punt

Kicker Bobby Stokes drops back
for Miami. Killian and Joe Curtin
crash through to block the punt,
the ball rolls free, and Jay Mc-
Cune scoops it up and rambles
for a touchdown.

In the tangled pile of Stokes,
Killian and Curtin, it was Killian
who came up with battered facial
features.

“I blocked the ball with my
forearm,” he painfully recalls.
“Then Joe and I ran together.
Some say his heel got me, and
some say it was his elbow. The
ﬁlms aren’t clear.”

Why did he bother to rush the
kicker with the game long out of
reach?

“I’ve been asking myself the
same question all the time,” says
Killian. “Only ten seconds left,
that’s the joke of it. I know I
didn’t shy away from the play.”
He pointed to his eye. “I’ve got
this to prove it.”

It seems that the Panthers had
tried to block Miami’s punts all
night. “We knew our play would
work sooner or later,” Killian
notes. He only wishes it had
worked sooner.

week in Miami as he garnered 21 defensive points.

For his efforts Killian is now
a member of the Prowling Pack
of Panthers, a blue star man.
Last Friday he played defense
with a recklessness that said to
heck with the score.

“As long as you’re going to
play, you might as well have
some fun,” he "smiles. A little
painfully at that. “We’re hitting
hard regardless of whether the
offense moves. the ball or not.”

Miami kept Killian busy at his
cornerback spot. With only four

healthy pass defenders, the Pan- ’

thers didn’t stand much of a
chance against the sheer num-
ber of Hurricanes. '
“Everytime I looked up, they
were sending down a netset of
backs on pass patterns,” he ex-
plains. “They had a whole bunch
of players wearing clean uni-
forms. 0

“I got dizzy early in the game,”
continues Killian, “but I shook it
off after three or four plays.” He

Eight of those points came when he blocked a
Hurricane punt late in the fourth quarter, an
event he’ll remember for awhile. -

has a history of bizarre injuries,
starting in fall camp when he
was playing tailback on offense.

“I was the tailback for the
second string offense running
against the ﬁrst string defense,”
the Panther junior remembers.
“There wasn’t much blocking and
at least ﬁve guys hit me at once.”

That incident left a scar across
Ki1lian’s chin from the six stitch-
es required to stop the blood. It
sure hasn’t been a dull season
for him.

Top Teams
Face Mainly
Easy Times

Five football teams in the Top
Ten of both the Associated Press
and United Press International
polls have unbeaten records. The
teams are Notre Dame (7-0),
Michigan State (8-0), Alabama
(7-0), Georgia Tech (8-0), ‘and
Nebraska (8-0).

The interesting feature of these
teams’ records is that the com-
bined won—and—loss records of
their opponents is below .500.

Of Notre Dame's opponents,
three have winning records -
Purdue, Army, and Oklahoma.
The combined records of its ﬁrst
seven opponents is 25-28-1. Sub-
tracting the Panthers’ record, it
would be 24-21-1.

Only one opponent of Michigan
State, Purdue, has a winning rec-
ord. The combined records of
MSU’s opponents is 28-34-1.

The Crimson Tide has had
three opponents on their sched-
ule with winning records and
the same is true for Georgia
Tech. The opponents’ records of
Alabama is 20-23-1 and those of
the Rambling Wreck are 28-31-2.

Of the unbeaten teams, Nebras-
ka has had the easiest time of it.
The combined records of its op-
ponents is 17-38-6.

In contrast ﬁve of the Pan-
thers’ ten opponents this year
have complied winning records
to date. They are UCLA, which

has lost only one game; Army,‘

which has lost two; Syracuse,
winner of seven straight after
two opening losses; undefeated
Notre Dame; and two time loser
Miami. Two of those teams might
be in a post-season bowl game——
UCLA and Miami..

Quarterback Ed James Returns
For Panther - N ittany Lion Rfivalry

The man is back in the picture
again. And his presence may
give the Panthers the needed mo-
mentum to upset Penn State in
this Saturday’s big homecoming
game.

His name is Ed James. Since
he injured his shoulder in the
Army game, he has seen very
limited action. He missed the
Syracuse -(33-7) and the Notre
Dame (40-0) upheavals, but ap-
peared against Miami.in a 38-14.-
losing cause last Saturday.

Against the Hurricanes, James
completed ﬁve of nine passes for
114 yards and one touchdown.
Added to his previouns record,
this gives him a 48 percentage
completion average for 879 yards
and four scoring tosses.

His only drawback is the num-
ber 12 under the passes he had
intercepted column, but when he
was absent from the lineup, the
Panthers were without their one
big offensive weapon.

James’ absence may also have
hindered split end Bob Longo,
who now needs only seven more
receptions to establish a school
record of most passes in one sea-
son. He now has caught 39 for
585 yards and has scored four
touchdowns.

Last year Longo caught six
passes in the 30-27 win over the
Nittany Lions. That was the game
in which little Frank Clark, a
5-7, 175 pounder from Bessemer,
Pa.,.kicked an 18-yard ﬁeld goal
with three seconds remaining on
the clock to give the Panthers
the upset.

Physically, the Panthers are
in good shape. Only wingback
Skip Orszulak, who missed the

   

  

Miami game with a groin injury
is listed as a doubtful starter.
Defensive halfback Paul Killian,
who needed 11 stitches to close
cuts around his eyes which he

“THAT’S IT,” the referee appears to be saying
after the Cubs scored their only touchdown on a

 

got attempting to block a punt,
will be able to play. Offensive
tackle Howard Heit is limited to
kicking duties because of a knee
injury.

Before the freshman foot
ball season started Dave
Hart sat in his office and en-
thusiastically discussed the
bright future of the Panther
Cubs. The season went by
and the frosh won only one of
four games. Monday Dave Hart
sat in his office and was apolo-
getic.

But he wasn’t apologizing for
his freshmen and the way they
played, he was apologizing to
them for the way they had tc
play.

“This group,” said Hart, “are
the messiahs for us and the mar-
tyrs of our program. They went
through a year that no other
freshman group can expect to gc
through here.

“I am convinced that the guys

_ right there are the beginning.”

The coach went on to explain
that he had talked to Athletic
Director Frank Carver about im-
proving the program and that
freshman coach Steve Petro needs
more help and will get some as-
sistant coaches next year.

“This year isn't the answer to
our problem,” Hart went on, “but
it’s a hell of an improvement.
Thirty-two scholarships is better
than 16. And the four games
these kids played in gave them
some experience that this year’s
sophomores didn’t have.”

Hart was also very high on the
chances of the freshmen helping
his varsity next year. He felt the
Cubs had better personnel at
some positions this year than the
varsity.

“The ends were the best posi-
tion we recruited. They’re big
and they all may not play end.

. Rod Fedorchak and Paul Napon-

ick are the type that can play
end, tackle, or even center. Na-
ponick is out of position at de-
fensive end. He may even play
linebacker.”

Coach Hart admitted that the
line needs more help than any-
thing else. They need more and
bigger lineman. Plans are being
made now for a big weight con-
ditioning program this winter.

Sig Chi Defense Stops
Pi Lam in Title Game

by DAN LICHENSTEIN
As the Panthers have illustrated, when your offense
fails, there’s not much chance of Winning. Pi Lambda Phi’s
offense hasn’t scored in three weeks, and it ﬁnally caught

up with them Monday as they
lost the Fraternity “A” League
championship to a tough Sigma
Chi team, 9-2. In the “B” League,
Delta Iota Delta beat Lambda
Sigma Rho, 20-0, in the semi-
ﬁnals.

Pi Lam’s defense scored a safe-
ty on Monday. But maybe their
scoring went to their heads, for
they seemed to forget how to
prevent a touchdown.

In any case, they forgot long
enough for Sigma Chi’s quarter-
back Jim Daniels to launch a 60
yard scoring bomb to Dave Weirs-
ma in the third period. A Dan-
iels to Weirrna toss provided the
extra point before the Pi Lam
defense woke up enough to stop
Sigma Chi from scoring again.

Earlier, the Sigma. Chi defense
had a. safety of its own. The ﬁrst
score of the game occured when
Mike Sawicki caught Pi Lam’s
quarterback in his own end zone.

The Pi Lam score came in the
fourth period when Chuck Greene

jumped on a Sigma Chi fumble
in the winners’ end zone. But by
then it was too late for Pi Lam.

The Sigma Chi defense may
not have scored as much as Pi
Lam’s throughout the season, but
they did intercept ﬁve passes in
this championship game. The
last came as Ralph Manning pick-
ed oﬁf‘ a pass on his own 20 to
stop the ﬁnal Pi Lam drive.

The outstanding feature of the
“B” League game was also a de-
fense, but in that contest only
one team seemed to have it. The
DIDs have to beat the Lasers
twice for the championship, and
thanks to a strong defense led by
middle linebacker D. J. Fillippo
and free safety Chuck Gerstber-
ger, they’re half way there.

While the defense was halting
any Laser threat, the DID of-
fense did its job. They scored
early in the game on a 20 yard
pass from Larry Lesniak to Mark
Zovko.

, Snyder Casts Away F auorite
Role for Part as Team Man

by MIKE BROURMAN
Last year, Jim Snyder was a contented
halfback on the 7-1-1 soccer team. This

year, Snyder is an unhappy fullback on a
3-6-1 team. Of course, the team’s disappointing
record makes him unhappy. But, he is also disap-
pointed to be playing fullback.

To Jim Snyder, playing fullback means half
the time. Halfback is where the action is and
that’s where he'd like to on the ﬁeld.

“I’d rather play halfback because you're in the
game a lot more. You’re in the play on offense
and you’re in the play on defense. At fullback you
just stand there on offense. I always want to get
in on the play, but I know if I do, I'm not doing
my job.”

Snyder describes his job as being the mainstay
of the defense. “I know if a man gets past me he's
going to score. When I was a halfback I knew there
was always someone behind me when I made a
mistake. Now, all there is is a net.”

It’s a lonely feeling standing there all alone
after you’Ve been beaten and your man has scored.
You know that every one on the team has seen
your mistake. “You feel like crawling into a hole,”
says Snyder.

To keep from having to dig holes, Snyder,
once he had voluntarily stuck himself at fullback,
decided to learn his job well. “Mostly it was get-
ting a lot of experience in a. hurry. At halfback,
I could rely a lot on my speed. But at fullback,
it’s mostly judgment, knowing when to go after
a. ball, and having to make split decisions as to
when to make your move.”

The judgment comes with experience. The
speed came with practice. At Twin Valley High
School in Reading, Pa., Snyder ran the 880 in
order to keep in shape during the off season.
“Speed is a big thing. It gives you a lot of conﬁ-
dence to know your man can’t beat you. Then,
you can take more chances.”

Another thing that Snyder has learned about
fullback is that you have to be tough. “There are
a lot of elbows thrown at you and you get knocked

arounrl quite a bit.” Playing football in high school’

has helped Snyder be tough enough. But even
he has missed one game.

That was the game against Slippery Rock that
broke the booters’ back. Whether his presence
would have changed the game is only a specular
tivc: matter, but Snyder didn’t like it: “I hated being
on the bench and watching a game without being
able to do anything about it.”

AFTER TWO YEARS as a starting‘ halfback, Jim
Snyder volunteered to switch to fullback this year
to try and boost up the depleted corps, in a vain
attempt to get the booters another wining season.

The next week, with his injured foot encased
in tape, and wearing a special shoe, Snyder was
back in the lineup. “I think mental attitude marks
the outstanding defenseman. It takes an aggressive
nature on head balls and loose balls.”

Snyder’s play and..his willingness to sacriﬁce
his own interests were apparent in his move to»
fullback. “I talked it over with coach Bemis, and
we decided it was best for the team, so I did it.”
The learning o-f a new position has not come easy
for Snyder. The switch has not meant wins, either,
but to Snyder there is at least the satisfaction in
knowing he has done his best.

and Mad House beat Panther
House. 8-0.

The Mad House-Panther game
was well played but a touch-
down and a safety was too much
for the Panthers to overcome.
Mad House’s win eliminated the
Panthers from competition.

A windy day and muddy ﬁeld
are supposed to handicap the of-
fense and keep the score low,
but in the Sutherland-Beacon
House game it did no such thing.
Sutherland just could not be
stopped.

Steve Solnoki, the Sutherland
quarterback, led the offensive at-
tack as he passed for two touch-
downs and ran for two more to
account for four of the ﬁve
touchdowns. Sutherland’s defense‘
was also strong; coupled with
their offense they should be fav-
ored to take the Dorm Cham-
pionship.

In the Independent League, the
Law School Lions nipped Delta
Sigma Chi, 7-6. The only differ-
ence between the two scores was
an extra point play that worked
after Rich Cappe scored on a
pass play from Steve Outnick.
The losers scored on a touch-
down pass from Bob Arcurio t0
