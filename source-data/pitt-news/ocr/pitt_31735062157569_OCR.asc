in the Commons Room for a tea
and program of singing by Wom-
en’s Choral.

The whole program is one of
music and the allied arts designed
to introduce the class of 1952 to
arts at Pitt. In helping to carry
out this theme, Mr. Fred Lotz will
play personal selections‘ on the
Commons Room’ organ duringithe
intervals between classes.

Raise in Tuition Rate

The University ﬁnally gave in to the rising cost of edu-
cation today and announced that it was raising tuition charges
$1 per semester hour and inaugurating a University’Fee of
$12.50 per semester for fulltime students. ' I i

’ Tuition increases become effective in September of .

‘next year. The University Fee will be tacked on to the

registration bill starting with the spring semester in

February.

No increase in present laboratory fees are planned at
presentiin the nomprofessional schools.

4 The University is the last of ‘the local colleges and
universities to up tuition charges. In fact, the current
increase is the ﬁrst since September, 1932. At that time
-the tuition was raised to its present rate of $10 per

semester credit.

University officials say that the increase in tuition was
necessary to meet the higher all-round costof education. The
University Fee will not.be used to meet current expenses. It has

been set aside at the direction or‘

the Board of Trustees for capital‘

- operations.

Such operations, the board spec'-
iﬁed, would include the purchase
of land, -the coristruction of build-

ings, the purchase of ‘equipment,

the paymentof capital debts or
such other purposes which the
Trustees shall authorize. (
Overall Increase_ ,
Fulltime students will pay’ a
University Fee 9f $1950 each’ se-

mester.' Part time and summer-
students will pay at the rate of $1‘ .

per semester credit hour.
The $1 per semester .hour‘ tui-

--tion increase affects all students

in the undergraduate students,
School of "Pharmacy, Graduate
School, School of Social Work,
Ellsworth Center, Extension and
-Non-Degree ‘ courses, and‘ the

' School of Nursing, except for the

Basic Professional Course.

Students in the -professional
schools, who pay ﬁxed tuition

rates, face an overall increase of

approximately 10 per cent. They,
too, must pay a University Fee.
This includes students in the
Schools of Medicine, Law, Dent-
istry, the Research Bureau for Be-

C-.uide.iFros|1 Coeds

At Reception 

Approximately 1700 guests, par-

ents of freshmen, meet Chancellor .

Rufus Fitzgerald in the Commons
Room Friday, Nov. 12.

For the past 28 years, the,‘

Chancellor’s Reception has been
one of the most important events"
for freshmen. By entertaining all
parents of the Freshmen class,
the reception creates a feeling of
understanding between parent
and student toward University
life, as presented by the Chancel-’
lor.

Main event of the evening will
be short talks by the deans. of the.
College, Schools of Engineering
and Mines, ‘School of Business
Administration and School of
Pharmacy.

Climaxing the speeches by the
deans will be a talk on student
life by Miss Helen Rush, and a
speech about the University itself
by Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzger-

ald. . ‘

Music for the evening will be
presented by « the University
Men’s Glee Club directed by Da-

.vid Weiss, and organ music by

Frederic Lotz, acting University
organist. _ V
After the main program, the
guests _ will be taken on a tour
through’ the building, seeing the
ﬁne arts department, University.
Library, Tuck Shop, Nationality

‘Rooms, and other classrooms.

Student aides chosen for schol-
arship and leadership will be on
hand throughout the evening. to

NO COMPLAINTS
Like the Tuck Shop, the rest of the University found that
it’s pretty difﬁcult to get along when your income remains

‘stationary’ and your expenses keep spiralling upward. So come

September of next year it will cost a dollar a credit more to
go to Pitt. ‘

We doubt‘ if the increase in tuition will meet with nearly
the grumbling that accompanied the rise in coﬁee prices. Most
people have been expecting it forsome time, particularly in
view of the numerous tuition increases in other schools, and
the majority of students, we think, will understand a_ 19 per-
cent increase at the present time. Especially since it is the
ﬁrst hike in tuition -cost since 1932. .

Sixteen years is a long time to hold a tuition charge static.
It represents a period of time in which the Uniyersity has
grown tremendously in every way.,During that period the stu-
dent body has increased many times over as has the faculty
and administration. _ V P _

And during the latter few years an added burden of higher
salaries, higher maintenance costs, and greatenoverhead ex-
penses'have strained the University budget considerably. ’

What may prove less readily understandable to the stu-
dents is the new University Fee, a charge levied on all students
for “capital operations.” I ,~

The tuition charges more or‘ less cover the current ex-
penses, but replacement-of permanent equlpmelll, Purchase Of

new equipment and buildings ‘cannot be made from current 111-‘

come. Those are the “capital operations” of which the Board

of Trustees speaks in its report. .'
They represent, to some extent, depreciation ‘of ‘equip-
ment and property through use. Since that depreciation is due,
at least in part, to the students, the University Fee attempts
to recompense the school for the loss. . '
Taken altogether the two additions to the student’s bill
total only about $55 a year. That’s not much when you con--
sider the increased expenses that it must cover. Nor 1S it much

‘when you consider that it is still" far below the tuition charges

of other schools right here -in Pittsburgh.

Put OVER "THE CHEST , DRlVEl

Just a ﬁnal reminder that the Pitt Chest Drive takes place
tomorrow. _ '
You’ve seen a lot about it in the News during the past.

‘few weeks but we thought we’d give you a few more words

before collection time. . V , ~

. A couple ofyears ago we used. to have ‘innumerable col-
lections throughout the school year. It seemed that every time
you turned around soin'eone wanted money. So a group of stu-

dents got together’ and plugged for a combined drive-one‘
that would cover every organization that collected from stu-

__d.en'ts, for charitable purposes. « '
That’s the history of the Pitt Chest——and _its purpose is to

 make it easy for you to give. .

, weekly throughout the school year except on and during holidays.

‘The people who are running the,Chest don ’t ask you for
much. Just $2. Spread out- among the 98 organizations which
receive contributions from the fund it comes out to apglittle
"better than two cents to each groiip. -

Included in these 98 organizations are several which are
designed to aid students. Some are for students in far off coun-
t_ries;,others -for students in our own country. One, the Men
and \Vomen’s Loan Fund, helps students right here in the
University. V A
’ -Remember when the student speakers come to your class
tomorrow that even the small amount that the Chest. Committee
is asking can make a world of difference to someone with much
the same ambitions as yourself. Your contribution might change
those ambitions into hopes. >

A WHAT HAPPENED?

We’ve been wondering' ever since the election what hap-
pened to the political speakers we were supposed. to see this
year.

Last fall everyone was clamoring for political speakers to
address‘ the students. Resolutions were passed, committees form-'
ed, students interviewed, and a policy announced. ,

,‘ Then no speakers showed up. As far as we know, _no one
ever petitioned to have one brought in. What happened?

VVe just wondered, that’s all. ' i ‘

[Out on a Poll

  

By Pat»1i"$egegj{ 

..

It doesn’t pay to be wrong—especially on
a nationwide scale. Ask the man who owns
a poll.

Thanks to the Missourian who fooled ’em,
polls in these United States aren’t even worth
the shabby remnants of leather on opinion get-
ters’ weary feet. Maybe Mr. John Doe resented
‘being told the tabulation of his vote several
days before he cast it. Whatever the reason,
pollsters predictions were turned upside down
and backwards Tuesday. "

'ions say? Just" as soon as they could‘ pick
their deﬂated, red-faced selves up, they inu't-
tered something about ‘calculating on the
basis of a light vote.’ ' ‘_

These nationally prominent yogis probably
were shocked to learn that the ‘heavy’ turn-
out ‘which threwrtheir predictions off ‘balance
was the lightest vote in 16 years. Such is the
metal of plain, ordinary fact. Embarrassing, to
say the least. -

Poll-Takers Make Serious Error

Even if pollsters won’t believe it, it’s ap-
parent they erred badly about a national is-
sue. Question of the week’: ‘Where to from
here? ‘ '

In the wake of this mis-guessing, even Don-
nie Q. 'Dingbat of the Pittsburgh Press scut-
tled his faith in the men who tell of tomorrow

this: A

“Start out at a Gallup, don ’t Roper in any
voters and Crossley your bridges when you
come to them. Then throw out results.”

It is improbable that polls will ever be
used again to foretell the outcome of an elec-
tion. Both Democrats and Republicans ‘might
justly be perturbed at the men who runpolls.
Many. Republicans might have failed to vote
because they -were conﬁdent their candidate

And what do wise men who gather opin-I

‘still asking: “Wha’ happened-'3”. Polls"‘aren

 -was winning in the homestretch. On the other ,

hand, the pollsters got Democrats angry at
them even before the votelbegan. VVhat seems V
to have happened is that the Democrats; to‘
a man, got their dander up and voted. They
didn’t like to lose the ﬁght before round one‘. .
Only when one understands the‘ wide range» 
of predicting pollsters, can the extent of 
damage be comprehended, . '
Pollsters don’t limit theirractivity to the “
commonly known task of plotting ‘trends, 
about current issues. They go right into homes 
and decide what kind of clothes peop’le-Wear,

Advertisers, Producers_ Depend on’ Surveys

After the questioning gentlemen chart ifte _,
popular in homes, they go on to decide» needs

ket, such trends are a great help to manufac-

Advertisers consult the pollsters "heavily,
too. Familiar to most everyone is the “Nin_e_q1;it,..

Until Americans» forget what_ happened ,las'-t
Tuesday, such claims are- laugh bait. ' 
Advertisers are really up a pool. They de-
pended heavily on such cailms for effective‘
campaigns. Only‘consolation -to the men who

It seems silly to group together Governor
Dewey with the Indiana football team but

Your Pitt News modestly whispered its dis-
sent and breathed the opinion that the Pitt
team would upset them in the game that was
played in Pitt stadium.
More recently, the News cannily decidedto
stick to  sidelines while the Dewey band-
wagon rumbled past. And now we can say,
“‘Nyaaaaaali.” Did we align with the Hearst
_syndica.te‘l D.icl we acquiesce to the whims of
Scripps-Howard? Did we join Paul Block?
An emphatic NO to all questions.
We Make Mistakes. Too » V
It’s little things like this that make col-
lege, reporters proud of themselves. And it’s
things like this that make us look down our
noses, at fall guys like Elmo Roper and Dr.
George Gallup. As they say in one of the local
radio stations, if you give a person enough Rop-
er, he’ll hang himself.

Into ‘Shmoes’

Maybe Dogpatch is out of
Shmoos, but the YWCA is special-
izing in them.

The YW has sent out bright yel-
low shmoos to their members ad-
vertising their bridge, bowling,
ceramics, and knitting forums.
Thus the YW members and friends
are invited to participate in, for
instance, Ceramics Shmoos. ‘

Marcia Krebs, Social Chairman,
has announced that the “Shmoos”
will all begin Wednesday, Nov.
10 with the‘ exception of the
Bridge Shmoo which will be an-
nounced later.

Bowling will be held at the Uni-

-versity Recreation Center 4:30 to

6 p. m". Ceramics and knitting will

both beginiat 61,45 to’8 p. m. on

the twelfth ﬂoor. .
" “Shmoo” meetings will be held
every Wednesday ‘night under the
supervision of trained teachers in
each of the ﬁelds. The meetings
are especially ‘aimed at beginners.
Anyone interested in attending
any of the “Shmoos” should sign
up in the “Y” office in room 1204

Miss That . Last

Minute RUSH 

By PEGGY EVANS

The man at Pitt most interested
in the Gallup poll is not the Uni-
versity’s own Edward H. Gallup,
lecturer in industry, but Bela
Gold, who teaches statistics in the
‘same department.

Mr. Gold is a former govern-
ment statistician who feels that
“there can be no question-as to
the accuracy of a poll if the sam-
pling is done‘ correctly.” He feels
that the size of the samples is the
prime factor in securing accurate

/

results. ‘

“Gallup’s or Roper’s errors
have nothing to do with poten-
tialities \of results in which the
sample taken is large enough, and
questions are ones which people

will answer truthfully,” Mr. Gold 7

emphasized.
Some important factors .must

be recognizedsby those who will
understand the polling technique,
Mr. Gold pointed out. Most polit-
ical elections are determined by
the loser securing 45-50% of the
vote. In order to increase the ac-
curacy of the results the sample
must be increasingly large. To
have. a result that ‘is within 5%
of being right it is necessary to
have a‘ large sample; to come
within 1% of being right the cost
would be prohibitive. '

Consequently, Gallup, who gets
a result within a plus or minus
4%, is still more accurate than
the ordinary citizen who can hit
accurately within 5% how. a na-
tion feels, but cannot guess within
25% who will vote.

In explanation: Gallup has had
a 2.-3% high error in favor of the

Republican in the past three pres-

idential elections. This would lead
to the assumption that there IS
bias somewhere in ‘sampling
technique, manner of selecting

pollers, or in the size of the sam- I

ple.
Larger are used

election polls than when ques-
tions of public. opinion are con-
sidered. Mr. Gold questioned, “If
the sample is larger, hence, the
result more accurate, in a poll
where the result is the outcome
of a vote, not a prediction, how
inaccurate and misleading are
poll predictions when-, the poll

samples in

tally is the real inﬂuence?” He

related this to cases where legisla-
tors look to polls for indication
of public sentiment. _

$5000 , Lubic Award Fund   0
Set Up for Average Students

In an unusual turnabout of customary award procedures, the

widow of a Pitt alumnus has established a fund of $5000 for
“average, students.”

The grant was made by Mrs. Paula C. Lubic, Los Angeles, Cali-
fornia, as'a memorial to her husband, Mr. Ben J. Lubic, Pitt Law
School, 1917. Announcement of the fund, known as the BEN J.
LUBIC MEMORIAL FUND, was made ‘ Thursday by University
Treasurer G. S. Rupp. 4;

Under terms of the agreement,
an award of $165 will be made
annually to “an average student

having qualities of good charac-
ter and citizenship.”

Heretofore, studentawards have
been based on outstanding aca-
demic, athletic, or activity records.
The Lubic Award, though, will go -
to “an average student—one whose
grades, may be on the ‘C’ level.”
Reason for this stipulation was
that Mrs. Lubic considered her-
self and her husband to be just
average students.

A checkback thru records, how-
ever, shows that Ben Lubic com-
piled an impressiverecord for an
“average” student. As one of
Pitt’s “Basketball Immortals,”
Lubic starred with the champion-
ship teams of 1914 thru 1916.. He
played with Dr. H. -C. Carlson, Dr.
Frank McNaulty, Jimmy DeHart,
Andy Hastings, and other court
notables.

“Ben was a forward,” recalled
Doc Carlson. “At that time we had
one man to make the foul shots.
That was Ben. In one game with
Tech he sank 26 straight foul
shots.”

Before coming to Pitt, Mr. Lubic
played basketball ‘for Braddock
high school. Of Ben Lubic him-
self, Doc Carlson said:

“He was one of those guys, if
you met him on the street, it was
like the sun breaking through. He
was always thoughtful and con-
siderate. ,That’s why this Memo-
rial Award is so typical of the
man. He would have wanted it to
go to an average student.” A

Although ﬁnal arrangements are
not deﬁnite, it is believed that a
committee will be appointed to
select the “average student.” The
award will probably. go to a
junior. , '

» ID Cards at Student Desk’

Identiﬁcation cards will be
required of all students for ad-
mission to the Penn State game
and subsequent events. A num-
ber of cards have not been
claimed. Students who have not
obtained their identiﬁcation
cards should ‘request them at

A Democracy

 

ag Boys, 13-7

A Panther magazine staﬁ that
had been glowing after achieving
a circulation miracle (for them)-—
a sellout of their election issue----
was blasted back into the"dumps
Thursday afternoon by the tradi-
tionally-powerful Pitt News touch
footballers, 13-7.

The year-in, year-out power-
house of inter-publications athle-
tics staged a brilliant rally to
down a futilely-struggling aggre-
gation of glossy-paper boys.

Unfortunately (for them), the
magmen weren’t as slick as the
paper they print their idle
thoughts on. But the mighty
News six, who, most observers
agreed, could have seered at will,
showed them mercy.

The lenient newsles spotted the
pathetic Panthers an extra point,
then toyed with them until the
ﬁnal period. ' 

When the newspaper grid giants
decided they’d let up long enough,
they dispatched Bullet Bob Came-
ron into the end zone. The un-
canny News scatback, Myron ‘Ko-
pelman, wafted a pass to him for
the winning TD.

‘Y’ Six Keeps
Hopes Alive .

The YMCA six punched cover
one touchdown each in the ﬁrst
and fourth periods to keep its
championship hopes alive by
downing the‘ Johnstown Associa-
tion team, 14-0, at Trees ﬁeld last
week.

Sparked by Paul Dulac, who
threw a pass for one touchdown
and scored the second himself, the
?Y’ team scored twice on quick
thrusts and spent the remainder
of the game warding off Johns-
town threats.

A Dulac-to-Molten aerial gave
the ‘Y’ its ﬁrst score near the end
of the ﬁrst period. Late in the
ﬁnal period’ Paul Trosac tossed
to, Dulac who dashed 20 yards for
the'- tally. ,.

Between the two ‘Y’ scores the
Johnstowners drove down within
the ‘Y’ ﬁve-yard line three times
without reg_istering.

The ﬁrst drive was halted on
the one-yard line. They started

'_again‘ on their own two, and car-

. ried forward by six passes from

 

Don Davis to Bob Keelan, went

‘ as far as the ‘Y’ ﬁve.

In the ﬁnal quarter, the Johns-
towners were stopped on the ‘Y’

By DAVE SMITH

- Fayette County’s leading scorer in 1947 now runs from the right-
halfback position on Pitt’s freshman football team.
He is Bill Sichko, 6-foot, 170-pound graduate of German Town-

ship high school.

I "After aiding coach Lou Rozzi’s _Uhlans. in their 7-3 season
-‘last year, Sichko played for Westinghouse mentor Pete Dimperio’s

victorious All-Star squad’ at Forbes Field in

long ‘gains. M
Bill didn’t limit his high school
activities to football, however. Be-

tween grid seasons he participated‘

in ‘basketball, baseball, and track.

»As a forward on the hardwood
squad, he was a four—year veteran.
In track, he competed in the 100
and 220-yard dashes, and also in
the broadjump. _

His ability as a third-baseman
in the other major sport compared
favorably with that- of others in
the district. In fact, following the
1947 German Township campaign,
Sichko ﬁlled .out the inﬁeld for
Masontown, a Junior American
Legion nine which took the West-
ern Pennsylvania championship.

-With such a year-round‘ pro-
gram, the 18-year-old athlete had
no difficulty keeping in shape.

Whether or not Bill continues
his four-letter grind, his speed,

_ conﬁdence, . a n d ball-carrying
prowéssshould prove valuable on
future Panther elevens. *

Although the lightest member of

Sichko has shown enough to war-

wing-backs among .the ﬁrst-year
candidates. ’

quarter aerial on the Pitt 40, Bim-
bo Cecconi sparked a drive to the
Ohio State 16 for the most serious
Panther threat of the game.

Comes , the Deluge

Then the deluge came. Joe
Whisler’s one-yard blast through

sneak over right tackle, Savic’s
ten-yard pass to Alex Verdova,

at the half.

Following the intermission, the
Bucks waited 10 minutes, then
scored 14 points in 23 seconds.
After Whisler’s, eight-yard romp

Sonny Gandee sprinted 25 yards
with an interception for‘ the. sec-
ond on the ﬁrst scrimmage play
after the kickoff.

‘ A 27-yard pass play, George
Wertz to Hague, ﬁnished the Buck
scoring-, although a fumble in the
end zone cost another TD on the
game’s last play.

A Weird Run Nulliﬁed

_An eerie 48-yard demonstration
of running pyrotechnics by Carl
DePasqua, far and away V the.
weirdest display by'a Panther in
months, was nulliﬁed late in the
ﬁrst quarter by a clipping penalty.

__A series of sensational escapes
put Carl in -the clear with nine
Pitt blockers still with him, but
he collided with one to ﬁnally go
down. ' ‘

Thorough scouting by the .win_

ner.s- had detected every Pitt
weakness,‘ and utmost advantage
was made of this.
_> Two_ great Panther linemen,
‘Nick Bolkovac and Bernie Bar-
kouskie, were towers of strength
in defeat. . ‘

They took as their starting point
a discovery by Dr. J (A. Nieuwland
of Notre Dame in connection with
the polymerization of ‘acetylene. By
modifying this process, they made
monovinyl acetylene. Adding hydro-
gen chloride, they made a new chem-
ical compound called chloroprene—
a thin, clear liquid at low tempera-
tures. Like isoprene, it polymerized
to form a rubber-like substance. But
the new material, now known as neo-
prene, required no sulfur for vulcani-
zation and was superior to rubber
under many serviceiconditions.

are superior to those of rubber.

Three types of Du Pont research

Modernresearch involves time,
money, manpower. To develop neo-
prene, for example, took six years of
laboratory study, a research and de-
velopment expenditure of millions of
dollars, plus the work of skilled re-
searchchemists, physicists, engineers,‘
and other scientists.

At DuPont, researchiscontinuous;
Some of it is designed to develop new
products or processes; some to im-
prove existirig products or processes;
and the balance‘ is fundamental re-
search to uncover basic facts without
regard to immediate commercial use.

-Each of ten manufacturing depart-
ments has its own research staff and is
operated much like a separate com-
pany. In addition, the Chemical and
Engineering Departments, which are
not engaged in manufacturing oper-
ations, conduct research in the in-
terests of the Company as a whole.

Deadline Near for 'Owl' Pics

Editor Tells Underclassmen

Quite a’ few underclassmen may be on the short end when the
1949 Owl is circulated in the spring, Editor Lee Karageorge ob-

serves.

Although seniors are displayinge
an interest in having their pictures
taken, underclassmen have been
practically unheard from, Kara-
george explains. ‘

Usually many underclassmen
have contracted to have their pic-

year. If those in this category
don’t soon respond to the Owl’s
invitation, the 1949 Owl mayhave,
to go to press without an under-
class picture section. .
Editor Karageorge says that he
can’t understand the lack of in-
terest, especially since the picture
studio has been set up in the Ca-
thedral this year. _
Absolute deadline for the pic-
tures is Nov. 19. It is not believed

that the deadline will be extend-
ed, according to the annual’s ed-
itor, since the Owl staff is making
every effort to meet its_ deadlines
for printing and engraving.

Owls may be purchased at the
Student Desk on the ground ﬂoor
or from one of the many student
salesmen around the University.
Picture appointments may be
made in the Owl office on the
eighth .ﬂoor of the Cathedral.

‘Debaters Take Negative Side
  In ‘One World‘ Discussion

After 10 years, intercollegiate debating returned to the Univer-

- sity campus last Friday as Pitt debaters played hosts to Western

Reserve at the weekly Pitt Town Meeting.
Dave Shaber and Jerry Phillips took the affirmative side for
. Reservewith Franklin Blackstone and Dick Moskowitz holding down
the negative side on the subject Resolved: _That the UN should now
be revised into a Federal World Government.”

The Pitt team contended that it°

would be unwise to form a Fed-
eral World government because of
the atomic bomb. They argued
that regardless of what kind of
administration set—up, the revision
of the UN into a Federal World
government would be dangerous
for the United States. They based
their assumption on the fact that
the U. S. cannot afford to relin-
quish control of atomic energy
for any government which in-
cludes a Russian ideology;

Western Reserve implied that

the FWG consistingof a president,
cabinet, judicial, legislative,‘ and
executive body would govern all
countries. With this government
of the world, Russia would have
three choices in the matter: ignore
it, ﬁght it or join it.
' Jerry Phillips, of Reserve, said,
‘‘Russia would not ignore it be-
cause it would cut off her world
trade. They would not ﬁght it be-
cause her odds in winning a war
with all the nations belonging to
the government would be too
great. This leaves only one alter-
nattve, to join the FWG.”

A group of 50 students attended
the controversy, many of them
hearing a debate for the ﬁrst time.

It was announced that the Pitt
Town Meeting for Friday ._will
bring together two well—known
ministers, Dr. Carl~Voss, chairman
of the American Palestine Com-
‘mittee, and Rev. Frank Hutchis-
son of the Shadyside Presbyterian
church. Topic of discussion "will be
“Zionism, Pro and Con.”
