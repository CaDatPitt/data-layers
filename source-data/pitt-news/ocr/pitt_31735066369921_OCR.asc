MORGANTOWN, W.Va. — Forthe bet-
ter part oflast week, Pitt football head coach
Foge Fazio was fed a lot of conversation
detailing the infinite abilities said to be pos-
sessed by West Virginia quarterback Jeff
I-Iostetler.

By the time the final whistle blew Satur-
day afternoon and once a majority of the
64,076 in attendance turned Mountaineer
Field into a quagmire ofchaos, Fazio had no
reason to believe words to the contrary.

_ Behind Hostetler’s pivotal arm" and
scrambling legs, the Panthers all but handed
Eastern independent superiority to WVU in
a crucial 24-2l loss. Crucial because Pitt still

has not found a consistent offense against

the power teams. .
And crucial because the record now

stands at 2-2 with no marked outlook of

betterment. _

Pitt held the lead throughout much ofthe
contest, but only because of some heads-up
play by the defense and special teams. Liter-
ally, it was all heads-up during the first
quarter. ‘

Spotting WVU a 7-0 lead, the Panthers

' started out with two stalled series that ended

in punts. On WVU’s seond possession,
tackle Bill Maas swept in on Hostetler’s
blindside and forced a fumble that was
picked out of mid-air by Tim Quense, who
lumbered. 75 yards for the TD.

ginia forfeited the ball with a punt that 

bounced before running back Tom Flynn 

could corral it. The ball rolling toward the

sidelines, Flynn raced after it once coverage ii '2'“

man Steve Scott also failed to pounce on it. »

Flynn scooped up the rolling egg and, not
hearing a deadening whistle, cranked out a
64-yard return; A clipping call on the play
pulled the ball back from the three to the 28.

“Tom Flynn is probably one ofthe most
intelligent players here at Pitt,” Fazio said.
“I can’t say enough about him. I wish we had
l0 others of him."

Two plays later, freshman tailback Chuck .~ 

Scales went around left on a 22-yard TD

scamper, pulling Pitt ahead I4-7 in a little '_

over three minutes.

“We gave them two big plays," Mountai- : 

neer coach Don Nehlen said. “Usually, you
can’t make mistakes like that against a
defense as good as Pitt’s.”

Except for a rifle shot by Pitt quarterback
John Congemi to split end Bill Wallace in
the ‘ second quarter, Pitt never again
mounted a scoring threat. —

Meantime, Hostetler effectively chipped
away, rolling out here and dropping back
there. Surprisingly though, the Mountai-
neers’ go-ahead drive materialized through
the run. '

Behind 21-17 with l2:27 remaining in the
final quarter, Hostetler looked impatiently
from his 10-yard line, 90 yards downfield at

Study AIDS

By rooo ERKEL
And DIANE LEFKOWITZ

\

The University of Pittsburgh

‘Graduate School of Public Health

has received a $4.36 million dollar
federal grant to try to find out why
the incidence of Acquired Immune

Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in the ‘

Pittsburgh area has remained low
when it has reached epidemic pro-

‘ portions elsewhere in the_country.

The grant was one of five awarded
by the National Institute of Health
(NIH) Friday and will be used over a
four-year period, during which
between 7,000 and 10,000 homosex-
ual males will be needed as volun-
teers. NIH also announced AIDS
research grants totalling $l2 million
to Northwestern University, the
University of California at Los
Angeles, the University of Califor-
nia at Berkeley and Johns Hopkins
University.

A major. factor in Pitt’s being
awarded the grant was the low inci-
dence of the disease in this area,
according to Dr. Raymond Seltser,

‘dean of the Graduate School of Pub-

lic Health.

“They [NIH] wanted to have con-
tracts given to different areas of the
country, those with both low and
high incidences of AIDS, in order to
determine why some areas are more
affected than others,” Seltser said.

Only 10 cases of AIDS have been
reported in Allegheny County since
1981, whereas hundreds have been
identified in other major U.S. cities,

particularly New York and San:

Francisco. Four of the_l0 victims
identified -here have died. Figures

show that  DS _is_fa,tavl for approxi-

  

_.A.I_1?S i_. 1. -

mately 40 percent of those who con-
tract the disease.

A major part of the study, accord-
ing to Dr. Charles Rinaldo, an
assistant professor of clinical micro-
biology and pathology at Pitt and
research coordinator, will be questi-
onnaires detailing the subject’s
social, medical and sexual history.
The study will also employ “state of
the art”-laboratory testing for indi-
cations of AIDS. '

“[This is] a“ series of laboratory
tests including tests for herpes vir-

. uses and the human T-cell lukemia

virus,” ‘Rinaldo said. “These viruses

are strongly related to AIDS, but we.

don’t know if they cause AIDS.”
The tests will also include the
checking and storing of the volun-

teers’ blood, urine and semen sam-'

ples as well as throat washings. Each

"individual will be studied for two

and a half of the study’s four-year
period. ' _,

All data collected .by' the five
research centers over the four-year
period will be processed in an agreed
upon, standardized form, and the
specimens collected will be held at a
common bank, according to Seltser.

‘Rinaldo said two things could
happen during the course _of the
study: .

“We will remain a low incidence
area and ask why we’re different
from New York or San Fransisco,”
he said, “or it might occurthat we do
have an epidemic in Pittsburgh.”

In the event of an increase in the
number of cases in the area, the peo-
ple already in the study will be
enrolled for further observations to
see how a healthy person acquires

 

better proposals.’-’,

  
    

a distant goal line. Though he probably "

Rinaldo said publicity has a lot to
do with why it took so long to get
major research into the AIDS prob-
lem. Another is that AIDS has beer.
restricted almost exclusively to four
major risk groups: male homosexu-
als and bisexuals, intravenous drug

‘users, hemophiliacs and Haitian
' immigrants. These groups consist of

about 95 percent of all AIDS cases.

“Those four groups are rather res-
tricted in the political impact they
might have in bringing this to socie-
ty’s attention,” he said.

Seltser, however, thinks the dis-
ease has triggered the appropriate
reaction.

“It’s important to
find out what you
can do before you 2
put the money into
it. B

--Dr. Raymond Seltser,

dean of ~.the Graduate
School of Public Health

“It’s important to find out what
you can do before you put the
money into [studying] it,” Seltser
said. “Knowing what you can do
with the money isjust as important.”

Despite the guarantee of confi-
dentiality, recruiting of the neces-
sary volunteers may be difficult.

This is the second federal research
grant Pitt has received in the past
two months. The first, consisting of
$375,00, was awarded August I to
look at the way the herpes viruses
affect the immune system and how
the immune system ﬁghts them off,
according to Rinaldo.

The AIDS research grant is “the
largest single contract in the two
years that I have been here,” Seltser
said. When asked how Pitt managed
to obtain the grant, Seltser_said,
“Pitt simply put together one of the

‘Diagnosis 6 Sought for 
Alzheimer’s Disease

By MIKE BUCSKO

Pitt was recently awarded a grant
totaling over $1.8 million- from the
National Institute on Aging to study
the disabling illness, Alzheimer’s
disease. I I

At a press conference Sept. 29,
Francois Boller, associate professor
of neurology and psychiatry at
Western Psychiatric Institute and
director of the study,‘ said the
research will be conducted over a
three-year period and will focus on
establishingdiagnoses of Alzhei-

‘ mer’s, not on any type of medical
treatment for the disease.

Boller said the research team, coit-
sisting of seven doctors affiliated
with the University Health System,
is looking for 300 people to partici-
pat-e in the project._He said they are
looking for people with early symp-
toms of Alzheimer’s and not

‘ advanced cases.

Alzheimer’s disease affects elderly
people and afflicts an estimated one
to two million Americans. The
effects of the disease are debilitating
because of the brain damage

' involved, with symptoms ranging
from a loss of memory to behavioral
changes, referred to as dementia.

The study is concentrating on
diagnosis as the first step to a cure
because there are no precise determi-
nations for detection. Alzheimer’s
disease can only be diagnosed post-
mortem, according to the
researchers.

said. '

Dr. David Martin, director of the  _
Benedum Geriatric Center, said'?.«j;,_
dementia is the cause of half of all  _
nursing home‘ admissions and it is 2
believed that 70 percent of all ';
dementia victims have Alzheimer's-
that Alzheimer’s _ 
affects_4 percent of all people over
65, with the figure increasing to 20 
percent by age 85. 

According to Martin, working -,
closely with the patient’s family is a 
crucial step in treatment. Counsel-
ing and advising both the patient '~
and his family can help to overcome - f
the hardships associated with the J
illness. ‘ U "

The goal of thewproject isbeing ;
able to “document and describe the], V U
natural course” of Alzheimer’s "1
which will hopefully allow for an- 
early determination of the disease, 
according to Boller. ‘ . 

The first step in the recruiting pro— ‘
cess is making the public aware of 
the study. Once a" prospective
patient is chosen, he will be required 

to complete both a questionnaire
and a phone interview. For this rea-. 
son, Boller said patients should be U
literate and free from any severe‘ 5
medical conditions. '

the researchers about participation

in thestudy should call 624-1557.

Struggle

By MIKE BUCSKO

Karen Walkney is director and
choreographer for a musical group.
She directs a youth program at the
YMCA and teaches a foreign lan-
guage at Pitt, and she just won a
beauty pageant. Walkney also has
what she calls an “invisible han-
dicap" — she is deaf.

The foreign language she teaches
is sign language, the musical group
“Beautiful Hands” signs to music,
her “Camp Get-Together” at the
YMCA is for deaf children, and the
title she recently won is Miss Deaf
Pennsylvania.

After several years of struggling,
she is finally doing the things she
always wanted to do.

“I had to be a fighter to get what I
wanted,” Walkney said.

Pays Off for Karen Walkney

Although she was deaffrom birth,
it was not discovered until she was
six years old when a psychiatrist
informed her parents of her han-
dicap. Before then, Walkney’s par-
ents thought she was mentally
retarded. She didn’t receive her first
hearing aid until she was eight years
old, when she began attending
DePaul Institute in Brookline.

She attended DePaul instead of
the Western ‘Pennsylvania School
for the Deaf because of its emphasis
on oral language. From there, she
attended Wilkins Township Junior
High and graduated from Churchill
High School, where’ she was the only
deaf student. She continued her edu-
cation at Allegheny Community
College, Boyce Campus and the
National Technology Institute for
the Deaf in Rochester, New York.

Walkney transferred to Pitt in
I979 and graduated two years later
with a bachelor's degree in social
work, becoming the first deafunder-
graduate student to graduate from
the university. During her days as a
student, Walkney taught some sign
language classes on her own, hoping
the university would eventually
accept it as a foreign language.

For the last two years, she has
been teaching sign language through
the Language Acquisition Institute
on a part-time basis. Class enroll-
ment has increased from six students
in April of I98l to almost 50 for the
current semester. Sign language can
now be used to satisfy part of the
university‘s foreign language
requirement, according to an official
of the Language Acquisition
Institute. _

Walkney said she is motivated by
her own struggle and now wants to
make the non—deaf community
aware of others with the invisible
handicap.

“I want to promote the beauty of
language,” she said. “I want to let
them [non—deaf people] know that
the deaf community can accomplish

' things.”

With the increased enrollment in
Walkney’s classes, Sign Language I
and II, a Language Acquisition
lnstitute official said people who
want to enroll for the Winter term
should do so as early as possible

because they are expecting demand

to increase. ,
Walkney said her students come
from a variety of backgrounds, from
interested speech and hearing spe-
cialists to people active in the deaf
community. _
Walkney’s own interest in promo-
ting the deaf community covers a lot
of territory. She startedand directs

Pitt’s Health Center

More For Your Money

By MIKE SIBERINI

“We come to you in more
forms than a tongue depressor
and a ﬂashlight to look down
your throat."

That is the message from
Franklin Carter. Director of the
Student Health Service at the
University of Pittsburgh.

Between 35.000 and 40,0000
students visit the health service
office located in Brackenridge
Hall each year for treatment
ranging from that of common
colds and ﬂus to allergy shots
and minor office surgery.

“Students look to our place for
the same services as their local
family doctor,” Carter said. “We
provide all of the medical,
clinical-oriented services."

All services provided are free
of charge for all Pitt students
who have paid their $25 student
health fee.

The health service, which used
to be called the Wellness
Resource Center, has changed a
few other things besides its name
since Carter joined the staff in
September of I980.

The most significant change
was the formation of the Forbes
Clinic to treat gynecological dis-
orders as well as to conduct fam-
ily planning and anti-smoking
programs. Located in Forbes
Hall, the clinic has been open

-‘since January I983 and treats
more than 4,000 students a year.
The move out of Brackenridge
has created more space for other,
more general, treatment.

Another improvement has
been a reduction of waiting time
in the office. For people that

walk in without an appointment.
approximately one half of the
center’s patients, there is a nurse
who will conduct a short inter-
view to determine the severity of
the problem and decide if it can
be handled in the office.

“There are somethings we can
help without undue waiting,"

“Students look to our

place for the same ser-

vices as their local

family doctor.”

—Franl<lin Carter,

Director of Student

Health Services

Carter said. “We try to service
the needs ofthose problems right
away."

The staff of the health service
includes three full-time general
practioners and three full-time
nurses. These people handle the
bulk of the medical cases. The
service also has two dermatolo-
gists, two internal medicine spe-
cialists, three surgeons and four
gynecologists, all of whom work
on a part-time basis. Not all
work in Brackenridge; the gyne-
cologists are based at the Forbes
Clinic and the surgeons work at
Falk Hall and are seen when
referred to by a general
practitioner.

“What this [staff] offers is spe-
ciality at a lot ofdifferent times,”
Carter said. “We have an excel-
lent staff here who are all very
willing and able to help the

student."

Another point Carter makes is
that the health service is not only
in the business oftreating illness.
but also preventing it. This is
achieved through several
methods. the most prominent
being the classes and programs
taught through the Health Edu-
cation Program. The health edu-
cation office is located in
Holland Hall and conducts pro-
grams in such areas as stress
management, weight control and
cardio-pulmonary resucitation.

A second medical awareness
tool is the use ofbrochures, some
of which are written in-house.
Others come from such organi-
zations as the American Heart
Association. _

With grant money from the
Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company, the health service
recently published a brochure
entitled “Health Lifestyles ofthe
’80s" that was distributed to
other schools. The service
doesn’t always write its own
pamphlets, only when their isn’t
an existing one to fulfill the need.

“We don’t try to re-invent the
wheel," Carter said.

And while Pitt‘s Student
Health Center is involved in all
aspects of medicine, it must be
the individual that seeks the
treatment.

“You have to make mature
decisions on what you’re going to
do,“ Carter said. “You have to
think about it now so you can
develop a better lifestyle. The
individual is the most important
person in the wellness of their

Opinion

Your Move

Want to play Monopoly?

The University of Pittsburgh plays the game every
day of the year; that is, it owns the board and we, the
pieces around Oakland and the Pittsburgh commun-
ity, can feel the pinch in our pocketbooks time and
time again.

When the time comes to write a check for books and
school supplies in the Book Center, it is made payable
to “The University of Pittsburgh.”

These days, Pitt is one of the few major universities
that operates under this type of monopoly sytem.
Many other schools, such as Penn State, have several
bookstores. One is usually owned by the university,
and often, two or three others are privately owned.

Some Ivy League schools, like Harvard and Yale,
have book co-ops that are actually owned and oper-
ated by students. Students at schools suchas these
have the opportunity to comparison shop and buy
books where they can get the best price.

Since Pitt runs the only book store where students
can buy the books they need for classes, the prices are
higher than they might be if there were competition
from one or two other stores. So students are forced to
pay top dollar for their books.

Price competition is a normal part of American
society, and it helps keep inflation intact. If given the
opportunity, students can experience a valuable lesson
in budgeting by shopping around for the best price on
books and other school necessities.

The Book Center also buys back the books it sells.

This is another area where the students get ripped off.
A student may sell back a $25 book and get only $7.50
for it, but the university will go ahead and resell it used
for $15 and make a huge profit in the long run at the
expense of the struggling college student.
A But the chance of competition in the book field ever
coming to Pitt is only something about which students
can dream. Unfortunately for both the students and
the laissez-faire system, the university’s monopoly on
the book market is here to stay. A

Students also find themselves writing out checks to
the university whenever they purchase Port Authority
Transit U-tickets, monthly passes and weekly passes.
The passes and tickets are for use on city buses, yet Pitt
still collects the money and probably receives a large
proﬁt since it buys those tickets in bulk form and
receives a discount on them.

lt would be useless to imagine that Pitt will ever
change its ways but, rather, will continue to over-
charge students on items that are necessary for their
education and day-to-day living.

Students who grumble about the high prices Pitt
charges for items will just have to get used to the idea
that the university owns Boardwalk and Park Place
and will never give up that fine property.

Enrollment Figure Wrong

Dear Editor:

Shortly after reading Ms. O'Con-
nor’s article regarding freshmen
enrollment» for the Fall Term (Pitt
News, Sept. '26), l started working
on my schedule for the weeks of
advising prior to registration later in
the term. According to Ms. O’Con-
nor, I would have plenty of time to
meet with all my students, discuss
academic or adjustment problems,
career concerns, and generally to
catch up on their lives since l saw
them last. However, to my conster-
nation, l found my proposed weekly
work schedule allowed me only to
see 96 students, the number I
advised last year. What was l to do
about the additional 25 students
who started Pitt this year?

By practical means, l had exposed
the fallacy of Ms. O’Connor's inter-
pretation of the information pre-
sented at the Faculty Senate
meeting. The CAS freshman class is
larger this year than last (as Dean
Schulman stated). I feel the problem
lies in the term “projected enrol-
lment" bandied about in the admin-
istration. As Webster defined
project, it means “to devise in the
mind." This figure is then a magi-
cally determined number (similar to
the process used by people to pick
Lottery numbers), used by the Office
of Admissions and the university
administration to tentatively‘ plan
student services for the incoming
class. Ms. .O’Connor further com-
pounds her'error in her continuation
headline, “Freshmen Enrollment
Drops Again.” As Dean Schulman
has indicated, freshmen enrollment
did not drop, but increased this year,
as it has been doing steadily.

According to Ms. O’Connor, the
decline in freshmen enrollment is
due to the actions of the Office of

Admissions, the very office magi-
cally determining how many stu-
dents will start as freshmen in CAS
each Fall Term. Perhaps the figure
used by the Office of Admissions
was overly optimistic to begin with.
Although changing local economic
conditions, increased private school
tuitions, and reduced financial aid
sources could impact on Pitt in
terms of making it more attractive to
high school students, perhaps the
Office of Admissions was deluding
itself as to the extent of this impact
in terms of actual students.

Another aspect of this situation
arises in even considering the admis-
sion of 2,200 new students. Is the
university able to provide even ade-
quate education to such a large
number of students? As many new
CAS students discovered in mid-and
late summer, somebody had already
closed many of the courses they
needed and wanted, courses the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences has deter-
mined to be essential to a liberal

education, such as English composi-'

tion, algebra, calculus, computer
science, and biology labs. Some
departments responded to increased
demand for their classes by increas-
ing the size of existing classes,‘ in
effect creating mega-classes. The
problem arises of whether mass edu-
cation through mega-lectures is the
answer to satisfying the educational
needs of the newest members of
Pitt's student body.

Although the freshman class was
projected to be significantly larger
than last year, it was evident to the
advising center, many departments,
and the students themselves, that
this information was a closely
guarded secret. Those departments
most closely involved with incoming
freshmen were not augmented to
cope. with the projected increase in
demand for their services. How
many students of those admitted
and-did not come do so because

there was no university" housing
available’? It is difficult to ask a stu-
dent from central Pennsylvania to
commute, and forcing them into an
off-campus housing situation as new
students to Pitt -and to Pittsburgh
reflects a further lack of concern for
their difficulties as new students.

In the case of the CAS Advising
Center, not only are the advisers see-
ing larger numbers of students, but
additional money normally bud-
geted for overtime hours during
peak demand periods was eliminat-
ed from the Center's budget. The
ability of the Advising Center to

provide those services required by.

freshmen, such as career counseling,
personal counseling, academic
counseling, and most of all provi-
sion of a sympathetic car, will be
severely strained. One of the most
important roles of the advising cen-
ter is to help ‘personalize this institiu-
tion of mass education, to mediate
between an impersonal system and
an often foundering student. Unfor-
tunately, the time necessary to ease a
college freshmen into the college sys-
tem is being significantly curtailed.
The ‘mechanistic, administrative
functions, related to registration for
an. increased student population in
the advising center, are assuming
more importance.

Welcome to the freshman class of
1983, even to those of you whom the
university administration has not

realized are here. Although you may.

be merely statistics, projected fig-
ures of declining trends, or simply
do not exist as Ms. O’Connor has
reported, to us you are real. You are
individuals with real individual con-
cerns, individual problems, and
individual needs. We in the advising
center will try to help you cope with
them to the best of our ability.

Letters

IJM,

The Pitt News, Monday, October 3, I983

Dear Editor:

This is in response to Walter
Burke’s letter entitled “Board Shows
Common Sense,” in Wednesday’s
Pitt News. You (Burke) havejust as
much right to express your opinion
as I do. I, however, investigate the
entire case involved before stating
that opinion.

The only investigating done on
your part is clear. You simply read
the front page of The Pitt News on
Friday, Sept. 23, and based your let-
ter solely on _that article. Otherwise,
if this issue is as disturbing to you as
it is to me, you’d have made an
attempt to contact me personally. I
would then have expanded on my
argument. That article, “SGB
Retains QPA Standards,”contained
one, and only one, direct quote of
mine (which is a very loose represen-
tation of the amendment I pro-
posed). If you’d have taken the
initiative to obtain a copy of the
minutes to the board meeting I
attended, you’d have a much better
understanding of the changes I'm
after.

I can assure you, Mr. Burke, I am
not out to “lower the academic
standards at Pitt.”I am fighting for a

’specific group of students rights.
Any student at this university, in
good academic standing, should
have the right to run for a position
on SGB in the same sense that a
citizen of the U.S. has a right to run
for president.

  Opinion

Changing SG B’sQ PA Requirements Good Idea

How would it be if a law were
enacted that stated only those citi-
zens who graduated from high
school could run for president?
Clearly, those citizens who did drop
out are the minority, but they’re
being discriminated against just the
same. They‘ve done nothing wrong
to have that right taken away from
them. Those students in this univer-
sity who fall between 2.0 and 2.49
QPA averages have done nothing
wrong either. As a matter of fact,
this university says they ‘are doing
fine. That’s why they’re not on pro-
bation. Are you telling me an infrin-
gement on rights doesn’t exist here?
It’s as plain as day! A

I don’t know how much of an
expert you are on student govern-
ment, but did you know that as early
as three years ago, the 2.5 QPA
standard didn’t even exist? It was
enacted to protect those candidates
who were running for the board
from falling into probation as a
result of their campaigning term.
Supposedly, most candidates’ QPA
for their campaigning term falls
below a 2.0. The 2.5 exists now to
balance things out and keep their
overall QPA above a 2.0.

Also, it (the 2.5 QPA) was enacted
to “protect” all those students in

danger of falling into academic pro-
bation (2.0-2.49). Protect them in
the sense SGB says, “You most
probably will fall into probation
because of your campaigning term.

So we won’t let you run." Are the
board members psychic? Everyone
with a QPA of 2.0 to 2.49 who runs
will fall into probation‘? Amazing!
Mind-boggling, even! Who are they
to say this will happen? The decision
to run should be up to the prospec-
tive candidate, not the board.

My proposal has the same protec-
tive qualities as the 2.5 rule has and,
yet, still leaves the initial decision to
run for the board up to the prospec-
tive candidate. It eliminates the dis-
criminatory wall that exists between
those students who can and those
who can‘t run.

My proposal states:

0Any student in good academic
standing (2.0 or above) has the right
to seek candidacy.

OAT boardsman is expected to
maintain a 2.5 for each term he is in
office. Example, 2.50-plus for winter
term, 2.50-plus for fall term. (No
such clause exists at the current
time. Board members are simply
given a “warning" when and if they
fall into probation while on the
board. It is my understanding that
this has not happened in a while.
But, does this show the “academic
excellence” you spoke of needed to
keep the seat they are in?)

0Any successful candidate whose
QPA (overall) falls beneath a 2.0 as a
result of his campaigning term (fall
term) will not be allowed to take the
oath of office and forfeit his seat to
the next highest vote-getter in good

Editorial OffendsPPC Worker

Dear Editor:

I am writing in response to the
September 28 editorial concerning
the Gary Hart non-lecture. The edi-
torial seemed to imply that the Pitt
Program Council, specifically the

"Lecture Committee, had a respon-

sibility to the student body to-
arrange this lecture and that the fail-
ure to do so constituted a ﬂagrant
disregard for the best interests of
Pitt students. In addition, the piece
censured Chairperson Al Frioni for
his reluctance to take on the project,
seemingly dismissing his assertion
that the committeewould not be
able to carry o.ff three lectures in
three weeks time. What a ﬂimsy
excuse indeed!

As a Lecture Committee member,
I am deeply offended by this atti-
tude. In the first place, it was SGB
president Mark Downs, not Al Fri-
oni, who was contacted by the Hart
representative about the possibility
of a lecture. SGB had the capacity to
sponsor such a program, which
would have been free. Unable (or
unwilling) to coordinate the activity,
Downs apparently attempted to find
some other organization to commit
its resources and hit upon the Lee-
ture Committee and A1, who has
extensive responsibilities of his own.
Scheduled lectures require ,a tre-
mendous amount of time and work,
both in the planning stage and in the
actual presentation itself. This fact
we accept upon becoming members.

However, we cannot be expected to
commit our time and resources to
bring off hastily-arranged lectures to
compensate for SGB’s lack of deci-
sive action.

Ifthe SGB was unwilling to follow
through on its preliminary discus-

sions with the Hart organization,

perhaps the lecture could have been
sponsored by a politically-oriented
organization, such as College Young
Democrats. They have brought in
political candidates to speak before,
as with gubernatorial candidate,
Allan Ertel. At least that proposal
makes some sense.

academic standing. (This would
influence those students in danger of
falling into probation (2.0-2.49) into
not running. They would realize that
the chances are high that they may
not be able to accept the seat they are
seeking because of their campaign-
ing term grades. Ifthey do decide to
run, and they do fall into probation,
this clause clearly states that they
will not be allowed to take the oath
of office. The ceremony takes place
after fall term grades are out. There-
fore, there would be no vagueness as
to what the fall term grades were.
You would simply be required to
turn in a copy of your latest trans-
cript to verify your QPA. You are
required to do this as a candidate,
also. This is the clause which allows
the student to make the decision to
run or not rather than having the
board tell him he can't).

0Add a clause to the bylaws which
states number three. ..

Number three may seem harsh at
first but, admittedly, a student
should not be able to take office or

run while on probation. The defini-_

tion of probation is “a limitation on
liberties.” Running for 3nd holding
an office on the board are rights, but
they are also liberties and, therefore,
can be taken away because of wrong
doing. I do feel that my amendment
is a much more sound and fair rule
than the current bylaw.

I don’t believe those boardsmen
who are against this amendment are

deserving of any type of award. The
petitions I have were signed by 300
people in five hours. That's one
name a minute, on the average. They
were students with QPAs of 1.2 to
3.9. The ratio of those in favor as
opposed to those against" was
approximately 75 to l. Those board
members, for whatever reasons,
were not acting as representatives of
the student body. Incidentally, an.
amendment is never “defeated,” as‘
you wrote. Signatures from 50 per-
cent of the undergraduate popula-
tion constitutes the formation of a
constitutional review committee.
When those signatures are obtained,
this issue will be alive again.
Finally, in regard to the slander-
ous insinuations you made in your
final paragraph: my level of intelli-

gence and/or scholastic ability, no v i

matter how high or low they may
appear to you, is not your place to
say. And, until you know me well
enough to make those types of com-
ments, I suggest you stick to proper

etiquette, take your opinionated ..
head out of that Y.M.C.A. locker
and use some “Common Sense” A

yourself.

Dear Editor:

On Friday September 23, my
daughters, grandchildren and I
visited the newly renovated
Schenley Hall. We were in awe of
its’ beauty—(the lovely seating
area for the Students and the
absolutely gorgeous ballroom!)
We then went downstairs to the
student union. While getting off
the elevator a Pitt employee was
getting on, but before she did,
she took the cigarette she was
smoking and trampled it out on
the lovely new floor. I was
appalled! Surely she would not
do this same thing in her own
home. '

Litter A ppalls Visitor

One of my first thoughts was
that this being the student union
floor, the students would surely
be blamed for this kind of abuse.
How sad when peoplejust don’t
care. I did not notice if there were
any “No Smoking” signs, but I
did note that there was no recep-
ticle to dispose of the cigarette.

I personally feel that the stu-
dents love this magnificent build-
ing so much that they will take
care of it. Hopefully such abuse
will not become “the norm."

  Pitt Media Emerges

( This is the first of a two-part
‘story on Pitt Media.)

By BILL BREMMER-—
So you want to become involved
with one of Pitt’s student media, but

 ,. you say youjust don’t have the time

to take a writing course? Well then,
you’re in luck, because tonight and
. next Monday night the Student
Media and Publications Board will

I be sponsoring the Emerging Writers

Program, at 7 p.m. in The Pitt News
offices on the fourth floor ofthe Wil-
A liam Pitt Union.

Student media advisor Larry
Lunsford explained, “The problem
is that there are a lot of people, inter-
ested in working on the Pitt News,
but there is no way to train them."
The university has no formal jour-
nalism school and does not offer
writing lab classes.

“The Emerging Writers Program
should stimulate interest in fresh-
men and non-writers in writing,
especially for Pitt media,” said Lee
Gutkind, chairman of the Media
and Publications Board. “New stu-
dents don’t have the propertraining,
and the editors don’t have time to

train them. This program will stress
the fundamentals ofjournalism”.
Gutkind pointed out that even

though the seminars are designed to’

attract freshmen, they are open to
everyone with an interest in writing
for the media. He added that if stu-
dents find the seminars helpful, the
program will expand to include
other Pitt media.

“We want to ease the transition
from inexperience to experience," he
said.

Two staff writers from the Pitts-
burgh Press, Jerry Byrd and Martin
Smith, will conduct the seminars.
Byrd, a Pitt graduate, wrote an
entire Press Sunday Magazine last
October on the history of the black
community in Pittsburgh. The arti-
cle was so well-received that the

Press sold many copies of it upon

request afterward.

Tonight’s seminar topic is entitled
“How to Write a News Story,” and
next Monday’s subject will be “How
to Conduct an Interview.”

Fraternities and Sororities

By TAMARA CHOBANY

Walking around campus, you
may have spotted people wear-
ing jackets and t-shirts with
funny letters never seen before
in the basic alphabet.

The letters, taken from the
Greek alphabet, do not only give
fraternities and sororities a title,
but they hold the secret for each
group — a secret that only an

initiated brother or sister knows.
Although approximately 10

‘percent of the Pitt campus is

“Greek” (belongs to a fraternity
or sorority), there are still many
common misconceptions con-
cerning ‘these organizations.
Some people envision fraterni-
ties as the “Animal House”

sororities.

Three fraternities belong to
the mostly-black lnterfraternity
Conference, and the other nine-
teen are governed by the lnter-
fraternity Council.

Pitt’s Greek system is not as
big as that in" other schools, Wil-
son said. At .Penn State, for
example, about fifty to seventy-
five percent of the student body
is Greek.-

“Pitt is different than other
schools because it is a commuter
school,” Greek advisor Bridget
Guernsey said. “Many of the stu-
dents have other commitments,
such as family, high school
friends and work.”

Guernsey said that since Pitt
is located in the middle of a city
where there are many other
activities, fraternities and sorori-

ties are sometimes forgotten.
Schools like Penn State, how-
ever, are located far enough

' away from activity ‘that the

Greek system is popular
because there is nothing else to
do. ~

According to Pi Lamda Phi
member tleff Mallinger, “being in
a fraternity or sorority. is like
owning a business.”

He said that fraternities living
in houses have to pay bills like a
regular business, and that the
sororities, ten of which are
located in Amos Hall, have to
maintain their living areas.

Eight fraternity houses will be
rnoving to a complex behind Pitt
stadium in the near future. Two-
thirds of the $300,000 cost will be
paid by the- university, the
remainder to be the fraternities’
responsibilities.

Greek System: Not Quite ‘Animal House’

-Mallinger said this may cause
problems, because if the fraterni-
ties are not able to fill all the
rooms in the complex, the uni-
versity will lease them out to
independent students.

On the Pitt campus, sorority
women and fraternity men hold
many leadership positions on the
student government and in var-
ious student organizations. _

Many members of the Pitt
administration are also involved
in the Greek system. For exam-
ple, Larry Lunsford, the Pitt
media adviser, is a member of Pi

_ Kappa Alpha fraternity.

“The Greek system is known
to have a diverse group of peo-
ple," sophomore Donna Green,
a member of Alpha Epsilon Phi
sorority, said. “By joining a
group with so many people, you
really do get ‘the feel of the
university.”

continued from page six

0 seminars, was created three years

ago to oversee the operations of each
of Pitt’s student media. The board
consists of nine members including
faculty, students, an advisor and
outside journalism professionals.

According to Lunsford, the
board’s duties. include overseeing
budgets, handling any complaints
against the media, and appointing
editors and managers. He noted,
however, that the board does not
interfere with the running of the
organizations.

“We also help finance the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh’s Writer’s Confer-
ence which will be held this spring,"
he said.

Since assuming his position in

1977, Lunsford has seen many
changes occur in Pitt’s student
media. When he first arrived, for
instance, The Pitt News was operat-
ing with a $33,000 deficit. Today,
however, the paper has an operating
budget of nearly $250,000 and

recently purchased five video dis- .

play terminals (VDT’s) and a Velox
machine at a cost of $80,000.

The VDT’s enable writers to com-
pile their stories more easily because
the machine automatically sets the
stories and sends them directly to the
printing machine. The Velox
machine allows the newspaper to
reduce or enlarge its own ads or pho-
tos, in addition to numerous other
functions.

thought otherwise, covering that

fgturf would be no problem.

P:



For l3 plays, eating up almost six
and a half minutes, “Hoss” handed
off to tailback Pat Randolph and
fullback Ron Woﬂey. A mixture of
shabby Pitt tackling and ﬂashy run-
ning moved WVU to within six
‘yards of winning a Pitt-WVU game
for the first time since 1975.

Time for vintage Hostetler. Rol-
ling right on a bootleg, the senior
quarterback covered the distance
with practically one stride.

Lifting up his arms, Hostetler
shouted, “Praise the Lord.”

He was not the only one with
praise.

“This is the best team we played,
and the defense now knows how
good they are,” Fazio said. “You
drive the ball 90 yards, you have to
examine it [on film], look at it
closely.,and see what’s being done
wrong.

“They ran the ball well; they did
the thing. They drove the ball 90
yards. Give them credit.”

“The 90'-yard drive for the win-
ning touchdown was just beautiful,",
Nehlen ‘said. “We ran a couple of
draw plays with Wolﬂey that set up
our passing game. Our kids did so
much today, I can’t say‘ enough
about them.”

Ditto for Pitt’s OB — in the first

E‘-half. In only his third collegiate

  

game ever,’ Congemi looked like

gold in the first two quarters, pass-
ing for 117 ‘yards on ll: of 15
attempts. One ofthose was a 15-yard
bullet to an ad-libbing Bill Wallace,
capping a four-play, 48-yard drive.’

But games are not won on halves

’ alone. On the day, Congemi passed

15 of 27 times for 148 yards and
threw three interceptions, two of
them deadly. ' -

The second, after .Hostet1er’s

bootleg, with 6:22 remaining, was
misfired into‘free safety Tim Agee’s
hands (his second of the day).

Pitt held one more matchstick
after that as the clock clicked on.
Four and a half minutes remaining,

3 Jlm Merrltts, a WVU tackle, records first

2;.

 

Pitt started out on its 16 but never
made it past the 22; Congemi was
first sacked by linebacker Van
Richardson (for 1 1 yards) and then
intercepted by cornerback Steve
Newberry.

"This is the
best team we
played, and
the defense
now knows
howgoodthey
are. You drive

have to exam-
ine it (on film),

credit.”

 

Pitt
headcoaeh
“Foge Fazio

With that came athundering roar
from an already-boisterous crowd.
Hostetler pulled out his usual strong
performance, hitting on 15 of 32
passes for 164 yards. Comparing this
to his previous four games, in which
he passed for over 200 yards, Hoss
played Saturday enough to win it.

His heroics came in the second
half after a Pitt defense sacked him
an incredible seven times. Also inter-
esting was Hostetl'er’s lack of pass
completion on the dropback.

One could almost perfectly pre-

dict the reception when it came on
the roll-out, a virtual Hostetler pat-
ent. And that's what he did .— he
patented WVU’s second-half
offense. _

“They were bringing a lot of peo-
ple after us,” a besieged Hostetler
said afterwards. “We moved the
pocket to avoid the pressure."

For the Panthers, however, all
eyes were predictably downcast as
they paraded away from a ravaging
crowd that swarmed the field.

“We’re mad,” Fazio said. “We’re
not happy about the damn thing.
Give West Virginia a lot of credit.
When the chips aredown, you have
got to be on Hostetler. That kid is a
real winner."

GRID BITS: Hostetler, perhaps
appropriately enough, became the
first QB to score a TD against Pitt
this year. Three and a half minutes
into the game, he hit flanker Wayne
Brown on a 19-yard scoring strike to
put WVU ahead 7-0....The Moun-
taineers tied it up at 14 when tail-
back King Harvey went in from the
one a minute into the second quar-
ter....WVU went almost another two

quarters — before Paul.’ __Woodside_

slammed a 49-yard ﬁeld goal with
1:24 to go in the third quarter....The
punting was won by Pitt’s Tony Rec-
chia, whose 341 total yards earned
him a 42.6 average while‘ WVU’s
Steve Superick kicked nine punts for
36.3 yards apiece....Pitt’s running
game continues to stink out the
place....Six rushers gained only 87
yards and netted — get this —
49....Pitt’s defense, No.3 in total
defense (222.3 yards/game) before
the WVU nightmare, surrendered
191 rushing yards and 164 passing
yards.... ‘

Chance To Be  

By ‘SCOTTHDELLETT - « ‘—

'MORGANTOWN, W.Va. —- Ten

- years from now, the date October 1,

I983 will stand out in the memories
of the many faithful Mountaineer
fans. Like the dramatic 38-yard field

goal by West Virginia kicker Bill

McKenzie at old Mountaineer Field
to beat Pitt in 1975, one play will
stand out.

The quarterback puts a marvelous
fake to running back Pat Randolph
driving off left tackle. Then he boot-
legs past containment and rolls into
the end zone, ending the Panthers’
seven-year dominance over West
Virginia and sending the record
crowd of 64,076 at new M ountaineer
Field, not to mention the entire
state, into a crazed frenzy.

Since arriving in Morgantown
from Penn State, Jeff Hostetler has
given the Mountaineers the key

ingredient for a winning team -

leadership. _

“When we got into the hurdle, I
said ‘Hey guys, let’s see what we’re
made of,” Hostetler said. “We
worked and worked until we got the
ball into the end zone.”

Even though his statistics were
not worthy of Heisman acclaim -
l5 completions out of 32 attempts
for 164 yards and one touchdown —
he showed what he means to the
Mountaineer squad during the final
scoring drive, an effort which con-
sumed I4 plays and six minutes.

Hostetler’s first big play come on
a second-and-seven on the West Vir-
ginia l3 as he hit wide receiver Rich
Hollins for a 12-yard gain and afirst

s .

down, a play which gave the Moun-

taineers some l'00I)'l I0 maneuver.

 

Great’ - Hostetler  

‘The Mountaineers proceeded to. ,
match to the Pitt '45 on the running A. T ‘
of fullback Ron Wolﬂey and Ran- "

dolphz. Seemingly trapped in the
pocket, Hostetler managed to find
space up the -middle. Instead of
being trapped,‘the senior from H_ol-
sopple, Pa., gained seven yards.
The third big play, and perhaps
the most important, came several
downs later. After two incomple-
tions, one of which was poorly
thrown, West Virginia was faced
with a third-down situation. Rather
than put the ball up again, Hostetler
bootlegged to his right — the same
play called for the touchdown —
and used his 6-3, 215 lb. body to get
the neccessary ten yards to continue
the drive. '
Playing in pain is nothing new for
Hostetler. Despite his size, he has
received many shots during his term
as Mountaineer quarterback. Hos-

tetler had to be carried off onto the « A I

team bus after last year’s game

against Pitt as the Panther defense ~

pounded him into the artifical turf.
He accumulated so many injuries

. during the middle of last season that

the injury report simply read: ‘Hos-
tetler — bruised body.‘ 8
Hostetler experienced a similar
beating in the first half of Saturday’s
game. Staying in the pocket, he was
sacked five times by the Panther
defense. He also sustained a hit hard
enough to pop the ball into Pitt
tackle Tim Quense’s hands, resulting
in a touchdown. if
The various bruises on Hostetler's
upper torso showed the beating he‘
had suffered, and interviews in the
locker room were cut short, as a visit
to the training room awaited. This
continued on pagqjourteen

From Killer Mascot To Killer Ba//cons,

By MARK A. SINDLER

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. —
Observations from a perch high
above hillbilly country:

_ O I don't give one WVU football
helmet about what anyone else says.
The Mountaineer mascot, Mike
Russell (he’s actually got a name),
should be a convicted felon. This
raving maniac strolls on the Moun-
taineer Field sidelines with this enor-
mous musket.

Everytime the Mountaineers do
something utterly fantastic, this pre-

' historic thing in a sheepskin facsim-

ile shoots his medieval riﬂe into the
air. The thing’s loaded! With what, I
don‘t know.

Just get him away from civiliza-
tion. Stick him in one of those Blue
Ridge mountain caves where he can
legally hunt. He is dangerous.

The Pitt'News, Monday, October 3, 1983

0 Followers of Pitt Panther foot-
ball, take notice. Pitt vs. West Vir-
ginia. It's a big game, right? If you
consider yourselfa real college foot-
ball fan, take note of WVU fans. At
least, the students. Some of these
people, in their right mind, camped
outside the stadium since Thursday
nig-ht, and their section was filled
since 9 a.m., Saturday.

That’s called loyalty. Moreover,
the stadium neared the passing-out
limit with l0,000 more people than
capacity jammed into every crevice.

When was the last time Pitt Sta-
dium had 10,000 over capacity
jammed into every crack? Or when
was the last time half the student
body attended a football game on
one Saturday afternoon?

Unofficial counts had ll,000 at
Mountaineer Field —— or about half
of West Virginia's undergraduate
enrollment.

0 An enterprising meathead broke
into Pitt's lockerroom prior to half-
time. West Virginia State Police
officers collared David Alioto and
kicked the roach out of the stadium
after some questioning.

0 Plane passing over before kick-
off: “WVU Surgeons Beat Pitt.”

Give you any ideas, Pitt Med
School students, for this week's
home encounter with the Florida
State Seminoles.?

How about “Heads Will Roll” for
starters?

0 The Panthers were not the only
ones putting on a bad show at
Mountaineer Field. The marching
band once again paled in compari-
son to the enemy opposition.

' I mean, how often do we have to
look forward to that ‘same old align-
ment of band members lining up and
spelling “Pitt” in longhand forma-
tion? lt’s dull.

WHERE: BENEDUM HALL

': “ON IBDOADWAY” .

WVU’s musicians looked pretty
impressive during halftime ceremo-
nies. One setup had them spreading
out in a circle fan from the center of
the field like a rainbow with expand-
ing stripes. Another had them out-
lining their state border. Looked like
the real thing.

0 Always bearingthe brunt ofeco-
nomic woes, West Virginia is having
no picnic right now. But that doesn’t
mean their fans can’t show some
creativeness once in a while.

Case in point were the signs hang-
ing from the second level near the
student section. Hardly any were
entertaining. And that’s if one could
read the damn things. They were so
bloody small.

But for those with eyes of a tele-
scope, what was there turned out to
be the usual fare: “CBS and Moun-
taineers, WVU Are No. l"; “Pitt ls
Ripe For Picking”; “WVU; The
Beast Of The East.” ,

in front of both squads‘ lockerrooms
during the game’s first three quarters
with a huge helium balloon structure
that spelled out West Virginia’s offi-
cial athletic symbol (ant intercon-
nected “W” and “V").

When Hostetler vaulted the

Mountaineers ahead in the fourth
quarter, the fans rose to their feet

and created a sonic boom. As if on'7Z'

cue, the balloon rose and started
drifting toward the press box‘s north
end.

As if in onslaught formation, the
menacing thing brushed up against
the window facade and bounded
away. '

*>.- V,
1’ tournament as a

By LAURIE KUBLI

 Seagully, sandy beaches and gam-
bling casinos draw many Western
Pennsylvanians to the Jersey shores,
but Pitt’s women’s volleyball team
travelled east to. gollect victories
instead of seashells.

Coach Shelton Collier (19-2)
returned to Oakland in the wee
hours of sunday morning with three
match victories and a fifth tourna-
ment win, but he may have taken a
chance in keeping his players" in class
Friday afternoon.

“It was my decision to leave after

asses Friday, so we started the
result rather
slowly,” he said. _

After an eight-hour driveFriday
night the team arrived at Seton Hall
for the Big East Southern Division
Tournament around midnight,
upon which Coach Collier puts
some of the blame for his team’s
sluggish start. At approximately
10:30 Saturday morning, Pitt took

, on Villanova and quickly fell into an

.‘@0-9 rut.

“That was partly because of the
long drive and late arrival the night
before,” Collier maintained. “But we
came back to win 15-12, so that was
a good sign for our team.”

It was a sign of things past, as well
as things to come. Co1lier’s 10-
woman roster has made a habit of
winning, and the squad continued in
this vein by defeating Vi1lanova’s
Lady Wildcats the next two games

ﬁto take the match, 15-6, 15-3'.

Pitt next put Georgetown on the
chopping block, but just when it

. seemed the Lady Panthers eo.uldn’t~ = 

be stopped, after taking the Lady
Hoyas 15-9 and 15-7 the first two
games, Georgetown revived to take
one back, 15-6. Pitt quickly returned
to form and lowered the boom, 15-3,
to win the match. _

Host Seton Hall may have spent a
more productive evening building
sandcastles or dropping slugs in slot
machines, but instead crumbled
under the surging Lady Panthers,
dropping straight games, 15-8, 15-0,
15-9. ‘

Pitt’s lady spikers have five first-
place finishes in the five tourna-
ments in which they have
participated this season, but this vic-
tory holds more significance than
the first four. .

According to Collier, “On the
basis of this tournament, teams will
be seeded at the Big East Conference
championships in November.

The championships will be held
November 19-20, at Providence Col-
lege, and Collier expects his squad’s
opposition to be much tougher
there.

“Many Big East 9 teams are
improving rapidly,” Collier said;
“but 1 can guarantee we will also be a
much-improved team by then.”

Collier also seems much more
confident with both of his setters
back in the line-up. “Ourjunior set-
ters were inserted in the line-up for
the first time since their injuries,“ he
explained, “and they played well.

§‘We’re a much, much better team

   

.111)’

with Judy [Young] 1 and Cathy
[Rupp] in the line-up. We’re glad to
havethem back." 1
Collier also noted the strong play-
ing of Carmen Tapia and 5-10 out-
side hitter Pat Belcher. “Carmen and
Pat continue to turn in stronger and
_stronger performances. This past
weekend Carmen again asserted her
leadership qualities and played three
very strong matches.” -
The squad has displayed a remar-
kable degree of cotinuity in chalking
up 10 match victoriesin 21 tries, but
Collier insists that it could be better.
“I think if you asked our players if
19-2 was good enough, they'll all say
no.
“Certainly, the injuries had very
much to do with the two losses. But
layers_and.l _don’t look at

4:; 5-91 1? ._'1y..4':¢f;‘~3

..

    
 

    

   

way. We feel we were in a-position to
win those matches.”

With 18 matches remaining
before the conference champion-
ships, the team is just over the half-
way point, and Collier disclosed that
he is now getting into the meat of the
schedule. “/

“We are now entering into the
most competitive part of our sche-
dule, but we have confidence now.

“We will be playing many

H nationally-ranked teams, particu-

larly this weekend,” Collier pointed

out..,“We’re going to have to con-.

tinue to prove ourselves.

“I think what we’re doing is devel-
oping a lot as a team right now.
We‘re developing trusting relation-
ships, and leadership, and those will
pay off at the end.”

The Pitt News, Monday, October 3, 1983  

 
 
 

No. 1 singles player Miriam Goltz.

And we thought that General Lee
had a tough time of it ﬁghting the
Civil War some centuries ago.
Indeed, a revolutionary week it has
not.been for The Pitt News staff of
college football gurus.

Most of us_ plain took a beating.
Picking out 15 games last week
_seemed easy enough. Even picking

ﬁthe favorites and spreads on them
6 seemed fundamental.

Right now, it’sback to basics. The
real basics. Maybe we’ll start stick-
ing solely to Ivy League games and
keep our noses clean.

Who would have thought? The
big stunner of the weekend came in
South Carolina’ where the Game-
cocks really stuck it to the USC Tro-
jans. Wounded warriors, USC ﬂew
home with its second straight defeat,
this one 38-l4.

Then there was that tie between

.99 Arizona and California. On national

TV, yet! Threes were wild in the 33-
33 deadlock. Everyone came out
winners in the Ohio State pillaging
of Minnesota, the Buckeyes on a
rampage 69-I8. ’

 

Our veteran prognosticator, Scott
“Scooter” Dellett had the staff’s best
percentage with a 7-7 mark. The

Hostetler has been the person who
installed such into West Virginia. a
team who several years earlier was
fighting desperately to gain atten-

Penn State stigma, one which has
impeded the growth of the program
in the past.

This could mean a significant

“This game is a important step to

they are winless against Penn State

If you're a graduating foreign language major who's looking
for an opportunity to apply your proficiency in a major
league, highly professional work environment, you owe it to
yourself to consider the National Security Agency (NSA).

As an NSA linguist, you will work on a wide range of
assignments involving translation, transcription, and analysis/
reporting that contribute to the production of vital foreign
intelligence information. i

You can count on receiving advanced training in your primary
language(s) along with many years of continued professional .
growth. There are opportunities to travel and to enjoy the
numerous cultural, recreational and educational advantages

of being home-based in one of the most exciting growth
regions of the l980’s, the Baltimore/Washington metropolitan
area.

If you are proficient in a Slavic, Near Eastern or Asian
language, the National Security Agency offers you
unparalleled career opportunity.

1 Salaries at NSA start at the GS-7 level for those who have
earned a BA degree. Moreover, you will have all the
additional benefits of federal employment.

United States citizenship is required for all NSA career
positions.

So don't compromise your talent.

Translate your language skill into something much more by
scheduling an interview with the National Security Agency
through your college placement office. If that is not possible,
you may write the National Security Agency, Attention:
