Chancellor makes budget appeal

. , Ryan Shaughnessy
Staff Writer

While a mass of more than 200 stu-
dents protested proposed budget cuts
on the steps of the capitol building in
Harrisburgyesterday, the leaders of the
four state—related universities testiﬁed
inside against the budget proposal.
Both students and administrators
voiced concern with new Gov.'Tom
Corbett’s plans to cutmorethan$900
million in education spending for the
nextﬁscal year, and legislators seemed
generally sympathetic to the cause.
“We will do everything we’ can to‘
help cushion the blowthat our in—state

students in particular would feel that I

cuts ofthis magnitude might impose,”
PittCl1ancellorMarkNordenberg_said

 

after a hearing with state lawmakers.
The proposed cuts come at a time
when Pennsylvania faces a $4 billion
revenue shortfall and after Corbett, a
Republican, has pledged not to raise
taxes or fees of any kind in the state.
Under the new spending plan, Pitt
would receive about $80.2 million, as
opposed to about $165 million it re-
ceivedthisﬁscalyear. That’sareduclion
ofmorethanso percent, anduniversity
leaders said reductions of that level
would mean tuition increases andcuts
to awide swath of programs.
Nordenbergwas amongthose1ead—
erswho participatedinapanel discus-
sion with the House Appropriations

Committee to discuss the issue. Oth-2

ers present included Graham Spanier,
president of Penn State University;

Together, these four schools edu-
cate about 200,000 students per
year.

‘ The majorityofquestionsliromthe
Appropriations Committee members
"were directedtoward Spanierand Nor-
denberg. The focus the meeting lay

inspellingoutthe implications thecuts V

Members of the Appropriations
Committeewilluse the informationto
propose amendments to the proposed
budget, which mustbe passedbyboth
the state House and Senate. The dead-

1 line to pass a budget isjune 30.
Committee members also asked S

questions about the implications of the

what students would do if they could

Spanierreported worries that his

students over the last few years and is
set to lose its federal stimulus money

“Never in my wildest dreams did

»I imagine the levelsof these cuts,”

Spanier said. ' T

sent 76,000 new graduates into the economy in
the last decade. -

“It would be hard to ﬁnd a better economic

said of Pitt.

“The issue nowisbetween the Haves and Have

One representative commented that universi-

Nordenberg was then asked the question,
“Why can’t you take money out of endowment

He responded that endowed ﬁmds have two

howtheir moneycanbe spent. Second, there are

“IfI raise tuition too much, I’m already priced

Cardin boasts Pitt degree

Speaker 4 1

Four years ago, he moved to the U.S. Senate,
where he now serves on several Senate ﬁnancial
committees that deal with ﬁmding for environ-
mental, small business and public works projects,
and several committees dedicated to foreign rela-
tions and entrepreneurship.

Pitt seniors seemed generally unfamiliar with
the senator and hoped he would address issues
that have been on their minds.

Greerlin Thomas, anEnglish literature major,
said that he hoped Cardin would condemn“those
freaking tuition increases.” ‘

, In an interview yesterday, Cardin said that

although cuts to education spending threaten
the United States’ ability to “out-educate and out-
innovate [its] competitors,”thisyear’s graduating
class has felt the beneﬁts of being educated in
“one of the most advanced countries in the world
and at one of the nation’s best universities.”

The senator added that he wants to encourage
Pitt students to go out into the world and make

. the changes that they want to see. It is up to this

generation to “advance the goals of the nation”
and provide the same — or better — standards
of education, health care and freedom that it
enjoyed in the past, he said. I —

EDITORIAL

Athletic scholarships
should stay

you know very well that Pitt’s

athletic department spokesmen
like referring to players as “student-
athletes.” But have we ever asked
what that soundbite-friendly term
means? Which component word,
student or athlete, deserves the
greater emphasis? Speciﬁcally, into

If you follow Pitt sports, then

' which role, that of student or that of

athlete, do modern colleges expect
participants in collegiate sports to
pour more of their energies?

One answer is athlete — well
that’s at least what Ralph Nader
thinks. Nader, a consumer advocate
and former Green Party presidential
candidate, announced last Thurs-
day that he believes the nature of
NCAA Division I sports forces “stu-
dent-athletes” to focus on sports,
at the expense of more important
academic pursuits.

 Consequently, Nader wants to

end athletic scholarships, which he
views less as scholarships and more
as professional “pay-for-play’? con-
tracts that have no proper place in
higher education. With the support
of the Drake Group, a college ath-
letics watchdog, and the backdrop
of the NCAA Tournament, Nader
plans to take his proposal to uni-
versity presidents, Congress and
the Department of Education, the
Associated Press reports.
According to the Pitt athletic de-
partment’s mission statement avail-
able on Pitt’s website, the depart-
ment tries to “sponsor broad—based
athletics programs that provide edu-
cational and athletic opportunities

for all students and equitable oppor-

tunities for all students and staff.”
What’s evident in Pitt’s program is
considerable focus on activities out-
side of the arena —- as seen in the
required study hall hours for Pitt’s
‘athletes. But not all universities are

I blessed with athletics officials who

rightly place value on academics.

So in the broad sense, Nader’s
comparison of NCAA sports with
professional sports has technical
merit. Athletic departments award.
athletic scholarships to students not
only as rewards for high school per-
formance, but also in anticipation
of ﬁxture’ performance on the colle-
giate ﬁeld. And in exchange for these
scholarships, student-athletes must
deliver a predeﬁned level of athletic
performance largely independent of
what they do in the classroom (un-
less of course they start failing or
missing class).

Considering the large incentive
of a ﬁill-tuition scholarship and all
the perks that come with playing
college sports, it’s not hard‘ to see
the opportunity for abuse of the sys-
tem —— universities paying students

' to win championships (which will‘

increase the institution’s athletic
standing and revenue) while not pre-
paring them for real life. What Nader
has right is that providing athletic

scholarships, without the applica- A

tion of overriding academic values
like Pitt’s, carries the great risk of
degrading the scholarly atmosphere
and disserving students.

But we think that risk can be
avoided - and at Pitt, it is every
day. ‘ .

What Nader’s plan would do is

~ change college sports as we know
it. Sure, the injection of billions of _

dollars more into college sports
probably won’t make our economy
more globally competitive, and of
c'ourse the college— educated should
wield far more important skills than
free-throw shooting or catching
touchdowns. So could athletic schol-
arships lead to the commercializa-
tion of college sports? Perhaps, to a
degree. But the scholarships’ ability
toprovide educational opportuni-
ties to underprivileged students and
put college names on the map goes
unmatched. I

TUESDAYS WITH MOLLY

Hopeful politicians get corny  

Molly Green
Columnist

Nothing is more enticing to apresi-
dential primary hopeful than the
state of Iowa, with its wholesome
cow farms, its impressive collection
of geodes and, of course, its key po-
sition as the ﬁrst presidential pri-
mary election vote.

It’s only natural then that GOP
contenders are attempting to seduce
the conservative voters oflowa with
their sparkling rhetoric and shame-
less pandering.

Recently, several got their chance
at the Conservative Principles Con-
ference held last Saturday in Des
Moines, Iowa.

Four declared or likely to-be- de- -

clared candidates spoke at the event:
Gov. Haley Barbour, R-Miss.; former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich; Rep.
Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and
conservative radio talk show host
Herman Cain. _ ~

As a devotee of primary political
speech-giving — the best way to
spend any Sunday — I’ve taken the
time to watch all of the contenders’
speeches and to grade them based
on three main categories: shameless
Iowa pandering, Obama bashing and
patriotic rhetoric.

Each category will be graded on
a scale of 1 to 5 bushels of delicious,
homegrown Iowa com. S .

Barbour: Dressed in a classic
black suit with a red-white-and-
blue-pattemed tie, Barbour decided
to lead in with a joke about his ac-
cent, setting the stylistic tone for the
speech: somewhat dry content with
variably received jokes. ‘

Content-wise, Barbour spoke
mostly on ﬁscal policy, energy
policy and health care (slamming
Obama’s policies more so than the
man himself), with no mention of

. social issues like abortion or same-

sex marriage. He didn’t even refer-
ence the American dream until 14
minutes into his 18-minute speech,
though he did make sure. to throw
in a handful of Ronald Reagan ref-
erences. .

Worstof all, Barbour was a pan-

. dering failure, frequently mention-

ing his home state of Mississippi
but failing to stroke the ego of the
hundred-or—so Iowans who alter-'

nated between laughing politely
at his Ed Sullivan jokes and look-
ing ticked off. But he did win some
brownie points with the crowd after
calling the United States an “exceed-
ingly exceptional country,” which is
somewhat redundant, but OK.
Overall, Barbour was a lacl<lus—
ter performer. A couple of times,
his sweet molasses accent nearly

_ lulled me to sleep. The most notable

part of this speech was Barbour’s
uncanny resemblance to William
Shatner, and I’ll be giving him a
bonus bottle of high-fructose corn
syrup just for that. , ‘

Shameless Iowa Pandering: 1.5

bushels U .

Obama Bashing: 3 bushels

Patriotic Rhetoric: 2.5 bushels

Gingrich: Gingrich’s delivery
seemed bland and ﬂat after the
folksier Barbour. His removed, just-
the—facts style reminded me of ori-
entation speeches by my high school

, principal, and he generally looks like

Beaver Cleaver in a white wig.

He started off by plugging his
own website, but Newt is a smart
guy, and four minutes in he dropped
his ﬁrst Iowa reference (a highly
original j oke about its winter weath-
er, to much applause). The best part
was when Gingrich almost cracked
himself up, but luckily he was able to
the hold most of the smugness in.

Gingrich’s pandering continued
as he began _to discuss the “core val-
ues of the American people,” called
the United States an “exceptional
country,” praised the Constitution

and made a dig at teachers just for

good measure (it’s the American
way!).

Though he only included one
Reagan reference, Gingrich more
than made up for it in his vitriol, dur-
ing which he referred to Obama as
a “spectator in chief who’s conﬁised
about whether he’s kicking a soccer
ball or leading the United States”
and the United Nations as a “corrupt
institution.”

While Gingrich wasn’t the most
excitable speech-giver, it’s clear that
he catered quite well to his’audi-

ence, the time both to deni-

grate Obama and to suggest religion

V. should be taughtin schools.

Shameless Iowa Pandering: 4
bushels -

Obama Bashing: 4.5 bushels
I

Patriotic “Rhetoric: 3.5 bushels

Bachmann: Bachmann ran in
with a smile and a bouffant ﬁt for

a pageant queen, and she did not ‘

waste time. Immediately she called
out, “There is no place like Iowa!”
with the same chipper grown-up
cheerleader voice Annette Bening
uses in “American Beauty.”
Bachmann’s pandering to Iowa
was like nothing I’d ever seen before.
She was a god among mere mortals.
Not only did she remind her audi-
ence that she was born in Iowa, but
that she was a “seventh-generation
Iowan.” She remarked, “Iowans are
very intelligent people  as well as
good-looking and well-tempered.”
She claimed Iowa was “the land of
milk and honey.” She contended,
“Whoever said Iowa doesn’t have a
sense of humor?” and that, “We’re
nice here in Iowa.” In fact, if I had
a dollar for every time Bachmann-
mentioned Iowa, I would live on a
mountain of milk chocolate and
have my feet washed in liquid gold
daily. . . .
Of course Bachmann is a multi-
talented woman, and she also spent
time attacking Obama’s Final Four‘
‘predictions, making jimmy Carter
jokes and alluding to the federal tax
code as “a weapon of mass destruc-
tion.” _
Content-wise, Bachmarmfocused
on “family” asa solution to the na-
tion’s problems, more speciﬁcally an

“intact two—parent family.” She pep- .>

pered this part of the speech with
references to the American dream,
Thomas Jefferson, the Founding
Fathers, the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, the Constitution, some
“death clock” that is apparently

T ticking, the “battle for freedom,”
Abraham Lincoln and liberty —— all _

delivered in the same whispery, ex-
cited voice complemented by shin-

ing, eager eyes.

Overall, Bachmann had a very
successful delivery style, using
short, simple sentences, rhetorical
questions and incessant repetition
to make her point. I sensed heavy
inﬂuences of Hemingway, my ﬁrst—'
grade elementary school teacher
and Solomon Grundy. '
Shameless Iowa Pandering: 5
bushels '

Obama Bashing: 4 bushels

Patriotic Rhetoric: 5 bushels

Cain: For me, Cain was the wild
card, both because I hadn’t heard
much about him and because he
chose to wear a yellow tie. But the
radio Show host assuaged any doubt
I had by mentioning the ‘Founding
Fathers, religion and the Constitu-

tion in only two sentences.

Cain spent the majority of his
speech maligning liberals as “stupid
people” who “want to reduce our
liberties” (the crowd loved this),
and most of his policy centered on
social issues, particularly abortion.
Unfortunately, the majority of Cain’s
attacks were on liberals in general

Pittjazz Ensemble’s Spring Con-
cert

Today at 8 p.m.

William Pitt Union Ballroom
Student Tickets $5

For students in Pitt’s Jazz Ensem-
ble, the annual spring concert is
“the big one.”

Tonight’s show is the only per-

formance in which all members ’

of the group participate,-because
many of them are involved in orga-
nizing other events. The big band,
as it’s called when all musicians are
involved, consists of about 25 Pitt
students with remarkably eclectic
interests.

“We have a lot of non-music
majors in the ensemble. 1 think
that makes it better because it’s
like we’re doing it for fun instead
of credit,” said trombonist Bran-
don Hang, a junior chemistry and
molecular biology major.

Simkin: Salads anything

Sarah Simkin
_ Columnist

 

Health nuts, take note: Green sal-
ads aren’t exactly enchanting,
but they don’t have to be boring
either. With a little imagination,
they can be just -as tasty as any
other meal and can easily consti-
tute an entire lunch or dinner.
For starters, there’s an un-
quantiﬁable amount of ingredi-
ent options beyond cucumber
slices and cherry tomatoes. Man-
darin oranges and sliced apples
or pears, for instance, are great
additions, as are any type of nut
or dried berry. Strips of steak,
chicken or fish, in addition,
lend a nice amount of protein
and will result in a more ﬁlling

Leon Dorsey, director of the en-
semble and an experienced jazz
musician, said a typical “big band”
has about 17 members. He said that
one of the reasons this show has
more musicians is to give as many
people as possible an opportunity
to play.

The Pittjazz Ensemble has been
exclusively preparing for this show
— which will encompass just about

every sub—genre of jazz, from funk .

to more contemporary and mod-
ern sounds —— since the start of
the semester. The concert will also
feature a guest appearance by jazz
guitarist Larry Coryell, who will
play alongside the ensemble and
also perform his own individual
selections. -

Dorsey described Coryell’s style
as that of a “chameleon.” The gui-
tarist’s musical talents extend to
every form of jazz, from classical
to contemporary and fusior_1,‘he
said.

Naturally, putting on a show of _

this size presents its challenges.

ALBUM REVIEW

 

Raekwon’s new release treads
familiar butwelcome ground

Andy Tybout
AssistantA&E Editor

Raekwon

Shaolin Vs. Wu-Tang

ICEH2o Records _
Rocks like: The familiar Wu-Tang

' formula h 

Grade: B

Kung—fu heroes would be proud: In spite
of a mercilessly ﬁckle music industry, hip-
hop veteran RaekWon,endures, undaunted,
unchanged. V  if

The revered MC’s latest album, Shaolin V

Vs. Wu-Tang, continueslto plumb the in-
tersection between gangsta rapand karate
ﬁlms, with strikingly few concessions to
current music trends.

Usually, this is refreshing; occasionally,
it’s tiresome. - ' i

In the spirit of 1993’s Enter the Wu-
Tang (36 Chambers) (the Wu-Tang Clan’s
foundationalfirst LP), the inﬂuential hip-
hop group torfwhich Raekwon belongs,
Shaolin Vs. Wu-Tang kicks off with a clas-
sic kung—fu sample before reintroducing
the rough-and—tumble gangster universe
—— beefs, back deals, sinister maneuvers
— that fans of the hip-hop group should
now be well—acquainted with.

An incalculable number of lurid narra-
tives ensue, conveyed through Raekwon’s
limber rhymes and colored by his pulp
sensibilities —— “Take it from a ninja in
scribes / Stay alive” —~ and talent for elabo-
rate boasts. , ' .

Equally standout are the guestfstars:
a veritable who’s who of ’90s East«Coast
giants —— Ghostface Killah, Nas, Busta
Rhymes -9 supplemented by a few new-

comers liké Rick Ross and Jim Jones.

Method Man, who appears on two tracks,

.Wu~Ta,ng rapper makes few changes to some formula‘

 

provides a particularly charismatic foil to
his Wu-Tang colleague, delivering some of
the most memorable lines on the album
(which, for sensitive readers, I’ll refrain
from quoting). j

Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect
of this LP isn’t the lyrics, however, but the
production: In songs like “Snake Pond”
and “Silver Rings,” Raekwon is audacious

enough to rap over traditionalChinese 
instrumentals interrupted by turntable;

scratching.
The result is a sound wholly unique to,

if not Raekwon, deﬁnitely his idiosyncratic -

collective. _
Ultimately, Shaolin Vs. Wu-Tang is an
inclusive, unambitious celebration of the
hip-hop subculture Raekwon and his Wu-
Tang associates worked so tirelesslylto
pioneer. l

Admittedly, a few_ moments in the al—'

_ bum feel unnecessary —— most notably, the
dunderheaded closing chant of “Wu—Tang,
Wu-Tang” —— _but no ’90s rap fan will deem
it an unworthy addition. For an artist who’s
had such a long tenure in the industry,
that’s an accomplishment in itself.

BASS/EBALL

Panthers avoid sweep at Ucn

Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer

The Pitt baseball team’s Big East
schedule might not have started
as planned, but by the ‘end of the
weekend, the players came away
from Stor-rs, Conn., feeling better
about themselves. ‘

The team lost the ﬁrst two game

of the weekend against the reign—_ '

ing Big East champions, but won
the weekend’s third game despite

' playing in’ less than ideal playing

conditions. '
With temperatures‘ in the 20s
and dipping into the teens, the

Panthers struggled on the ﬁrst two ~

days in most aspects of the game.
“I am not one to make any ex-
cuses. However, the weather was

- brutal this weekend — maybe the
‘ coldest we have ever played in,”

Pitt manager Joe Jordano said.

“Granted both teams played in the .

same conditions, it was just tough
to move around.” .

V The Panthers were also plagued
by active Connecticut baserunners
in the ﬁrst two games. The Huskies

stole three bases in the ﬁrst game
and six in the second.

“UConn led the Big East in sto-
len bases by a wide margin last
year,”]ordano -said. “They are very
aggressive on the base paths, and
it was more of an adjustment we
needed to make on the mound and
with our middle inﬁelders keeping
runners closer —.— several of their
stolen bases were third base.”

Pitt, led by pitcher Matt Woth-
erspoon, looked like a dangerous
team on Sunday when the Pan-

thers heldithe Huskies to only’

four hits.

The Panthers also avoided
hurting themselves on Sunday by
playing solid defense, and the win
will carry over for the Panthers as
they prepare to come back to play
at home.

“Obviously we wanted to go up

there and win the series,” Baker -

said. “We did some good things this
weekend, and coming back home
for a few weeks with that win is
huge for us.” I

Connecticut 7, Pitt 0

On Friday, the Panthers strug-
gled, and the score reﬂected their

play.

Senior pitcher Corey Baker
started for the Panthers and was
hoping to set the tone for his team
as it matched up against the de-
fending Big East champion.

Baker felt that his pitching was
not as bad as the score reﬂected
and that UConn was just able to hit
the ball into some bad spots. ,

Despite what the end result was,
I think I had pretty good stuff,” he
said. “They hit a lot of ground balls
through some holes, and besides
the home run [George] Springer
hit, they didn’t hit many balls hard

V at all.”

But Baker did not receive any
run support in his ﬁrst Big East start

of the season as they were shutout .

for the ﬁrst time this year;

The Panthers only came
through with four hits in the game
and were unable to even come up
with a multiple-hit inning.

SOFTBALL

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬂ” Writer

In their first Big East series of
the season, members of the soft-
ball team added two notes to the
schools? record books.
Collectively, they earned two
wins against the Seton Hall Pi-

_ rates, one with a score of 9-0 and '

another with a score of 6-0. That
gave them 13 shut-out victories
this year, -tying a school record

set in 2008.

And senior pitcher Cory Ber-
liner tied. Laura Belardinelli’s

_ (2004-07) school record as Ber-

liner earned her 44* career victo-
ry in impressive, no-‘hit fashion.
It was Berliner’s first no—hitter
and just the eighth in the history
of Pitt softball. ’

The three wins gave Berliner
her ﬁrst mentions in Pitt’s record
books and improve the Panthers’
record to 22-6 overall, tying it

. with Syracuse for ﬁrst place in
the Big East.

But in Berliner’s mind, focus-
ing on the intricacies of the pitch-

I inggame is more important than

chasing records.

“Before the game, I did not
know that I was able to tie the ca-
reer win record,” Berliner said. “I
don’t really pay attention to stats
like that, but focus on each pitch

so I don’t get, ahead of myself. It I
is easy to make amistake when

’ you think too far ahead.”

. That pitch—by-pitch concen-

I tration allowed Berliner to strike

out six batters en route to her''—

-sixth win of the season.’ “

The offense was just as sig- I

1

nificant as the pitching, as the
Panthers out—scored the Pirates
25-1 in the three-game series.
Meanwhile, the Panthers held
the Pirate offenseto a .109 team
batting average. '

Pitt’s offense generated early
in the first 9-0 win as seven Pan-
thers ‘crossed home plate in the
ﬁrst inning before the Pirates
could record an out. .

Leading that surge was junior
Amanda Heitmeier, whose grand
slam came after an early first—in-
ning pitching change. The grand
slam was the ﬁrst of Heitmeier’s
career and her ﬁrst home run of
the season. a _

For Pitt head coach Holly
Aprile, Heitmeier’s success was
a model of a coachingprinciple.

f‘We’ve always ‘talked about

we see after a pitching change,”

Aprile said; “Amanda capitalized
on her opportunity to do that.”
With two more runs in the ﬁfth

inning, the Panthers enacted the ‘

nine-run advantage mercy rule
for the seventh time this sea-
son.

In the second gameof the day,
neither the pitching or offensive
dominance suffered as the Pan-

thers secured a 6-0 victory with

freshman Karlynjones recording
her eighth win of the season.

Jones struck out eight bat-
ters and allowed just two hits
in her complete game of seven
innings.

The offensive attack was led
by sophomore catcher Holly

Stevens and junior right ﬁelder

Yvette Bravo, who both finished
the game 3 for 4. ‘

Pittrouts Seton Hall, Berliner throws no—hitter  

. . Throughout the three-game

series, Bravo collected six hits in
hernine plate appearances and
contributed two RBIs in each
contest. .

Aprile noted that the entire.

team contributed to the scoring

as the Panthers adhered toithe
original offensive strategy.

“We stuck to our game-plan
by getting runners ‘on base and
hitting the ball hard,” Aprile said .
“We continued to keep the ball i
play and put runners in scoring
position.” '

Improving to a perfect 3-0
conference record, the Panthers
completed the series sweep of

Seton Hall on Sunday with anal -

other convincing 10-1 victory.

TONY’S TOP 10

Cause for Pitt fans to cheer up

Tonyjovenitti
_ Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

 

R Now that I’ve had a week to let Pitt basketball’s

stunning loss to Butler settle in my stom-
ach, I’ve ﬁnally resumed watching the NCAA

Tournament —— initially with a “that should V

be Pitt” attitude.
A But I realized that while Pitt’s early loss is
heartbreaking, it’s not too bad in hindsight.

So here are 10 reasons why you shouldn’t feel ,

so bad about Pitt’s loss.

10. Sixty-four other teams lost. This year,
the NCAA Tournament included 68 teams.
And guess what? A whopping 64 teams failed
to make the Final Four.

» 9. At least Pitt made it out of the ﬁrst
round. Pitt has had‘ a few ﬁrst round ﬂame-
outs. It might feel like this loss to Butler was
the worst loss ever, but at least Pitt avoided
becoming the ﬁrst No. 1 seed to lose to a No.
16 seed. Now thatwould have been the worst
loss ever.

8. Uhh  it’s almost summer. The tem-
peratures are rising, and there are only four

weeks left of classes. So, there’s always that. »

7. At least they didn’t get blown out. Pitt

lost by one point in the ﬁnal second. George-
town got blown out by VCU, and top-seeded
Kansas was dismantled by the Rams. I guess
‘what I’m trying to say is: Be glad Pitt didn’t
have to play VCU, a team that is unbelievable
from 3-point range (yes, better than Butler).
Which leads me to my -next reason.

-6. VCU is in the Final Four. When the
NCAA Tournament Selection Committee
chose VCU for the play—in game over teams
with seemingly better resumés like Colorado
and Virginia Tech, all anyone could talk about
was how awful the Rams were. Well, in true
“I-told—ya~so” fashion, VCU is in the Final
Four; If you aren’t excited about that, then
you aren’t a basketball fan. -

5. Pitt played in the greatest, craziest

game of the Tournament. Sure, the Pan--

thers were on the losing end of it, but the

Pitt—Butler game will forever go down as one

of the greatest, most bizarre games in the
history of the NCAA Tournament. For those
of you who made the trip down to D.C. for the
games, that’s something you can always tell
your grandkids. ‘ »

4. We don’t have to hate Butler any-
more. Admit it, Butler is the ultimate March
darling. Yes, it’s tough to root for Matt How-
ard when he’s ﬂopping all over the court, but
how can you hate their coach Brad Stevens
or the incredible story that he’s written at
Butler? It was actually difficult to root against
the Bulldogs last weekend. The hardest thing
now will be deciding whether to root for Butler
or VCU in the Final Four.

3. No other top-seeded teams made it.
Pitt might have been the ﬁrst No. 1 seed to lose,
but it certainly wasn’t the last. Both Duke and

Ohio State lost in the Sweet 16, wliile Kansas '

lost in the Elite Eight. And ohlyeah, all of the

. No. 2 seeds lost too.

.2. Both teams Pitt lost to are in the Final
Four. Pitt played in two tournaments this
month. The Panthers didn’t'have the best luck
with the teams that they drew. Connecticut
is perhaps the hottest team in the country,

having won ﬁve games in ﬁve days to win -

the Big East tournament, knocking Pitt out

' with a buzzer—beater. And Butler has won
nine of its last 10 NCAA Tournament games.

Both teams are in the Final Four this year, and
they could wind up facing off in the National
Championship game.

1. There were still plenty of good memo-
ries; While college basketball fans have an
unhealthy obsession with Final Fours, this
Pitt basketball team has given its fans some
incredible memories. If you’re a senior like
me, then once you look past the tournament
disappointments, there were actually some

Smith’s bat
leads Pitt to first

Big East win

Baseball 4 11

lead, kept the runs coming in the third in-
ning by scoring three runs on three hits,
one of which was the home run by_Springer.
Springer was selected by coaches to be the
2011 Big East Preseason Player of the Year.

For insurance, theHuskies scored one
more run, this time unearned, in the bot-
tom of the eighth inning to push the score
to 7-0.

Connecticut 9, Pitt 2

The Panthers returned to J.O. Christian
Field the next day with intentions of getting
their ﬁrst conference win. '

Pitt once again spotted the Huskies a 1-0
lead in the bottom of the ﬁrst.

Chester, who went 1 for 3 on Saturday,
cracked a single through the left_side to tie

' the ballgame at one a piece in the top of the

third.

But in the bottom of the inning, the Hus-
kies broke outfor ﬁve runs off Pitt junior
Matt Iannazzo.

Iannazzo also struggled in his conference
opener but still showedjordano signs of the
pitcher that was selected to_the preseason
All—Big East team.

“Matt pitched well,” Jordano said. “We
made too many mistakes defensively, which
led to opportunities for UConn that it capi-
talized on. We are a team that needs to play

clean, smart baseball. We did not do that on

Saturday, and we paid for it.”

The Huskies scored a run in the sixth and
then two in the bottom of the seventh after
the Panthers scored their second run of the

' day in the top half of the seventh.

' Pitt 4, Connecticut 0

The four-run victory gave Pitt- its ﬁrst win
in conferenceplay and kept the team from be-
ing swept to kick off the Big East schedule.

Senior Kevan Smith started off the day
with an RBI single in the ﬁrst inning to jump-
start the Panthers and picked up two more
RBIs in the third inning to increase the gap
to 3-0. '

Smith ﬁnished up the scoring for Pitt in‘

the ﬁfth when he singled and scored on an
error by UConn’s catcher. He ended the day

‘ '3-5 with a run and three RBIs and raised his

season totals to .465 with 33 hits in 19 games.
At .465, his average is tops in the B_ig East.

The Panthers, behind Smith’s huge bat,
went back to the basics and played solid de-
fensively behind pitcher Wotherspoon to get
a win against an elite team.

“Getting that win on Sunday was huge,”
Baker said. “Going up to UConn is probably
the hardest place to go play in the Big East, so
being able to avoid the sweep is good.”I

Softball 4 11

Alyssa O’Connell, who gave up one run

and recorded ﬁve strike—outs. O’Connell V

has been impressive in her recent play,

allowing just two runs in her last 31 in-

nings pitched.

Once again, the Panthers started their
scoring early with four runs in the ﬁrst
inning and added three more in the third
by way of two home runs. ‘

Stevenssmacked her ﬁfth long—ball of
the season to make the score 5-1 and-short-
stop Niki Cognigni hit her ﬁrst homer of

the year, a two-run blast.

Cognigni was 3 for 3 on the day from the
plate and drove in three of the Panthers’
10 runs.

Though the home runs were a vital part
of the Panther offense, the smaller as-
pects of the hitting game also proved to
be important. , A

With two stolen bases in the ﬁnal game
of the series, senior outﬁelder Ashley
Amistade brought her series total to four
and her season total to 19.

O’Connell continues strong pitching

The positive start to the Big East season
was important for the Panthers, as they
are aware of the challenges they face in
the conference.

“Every year-there are good teams in the
Big East,” Berliner said. “We got off to a
good start, and we want to continue tha’l':'
style of play throughout the season.”

The next chance for the Panthers to do
that will come at home at the new Petersen
Sports Complex as they welcome Penn
State in a double—header contest today. I
