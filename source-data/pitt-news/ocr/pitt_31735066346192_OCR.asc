Cowell Directs New
Off-Carnpus Housing

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

The l"niversity has created a
full—time Off—Campus Housing Of-
fice to advise students seeking or
living in off-campus housing.

The office will be directed by
Ronald Cowell. currently assis-
tant to the director of‘Unive_rsi-
ty Housing.

After working with off-campus
housing on a part-time basis dur-
ing the past year Cowell said he
discovered there was a real need
for a full-time office.

“I often felt frustrated at not
having enough time to finish vari-
ous off-campus projects that I
started,” he commented.

Cowell said he will have three
major priorities. His primary
goal will be to enlarge the num-
ber of housing listings available
to students.

“We have a lot of out-of-town
students. particularly foreign
students. who arrive on campus
in August. unfamiliar with Pitts-
burgh. They»’re stuck and need
help in finding housing." he said.

Because of the great demand
made on off-campus housing fa-
cilities by the various area col-

leges, Cowell said that his office
will try a recruitment program.

"Well continue relations with
landlords and real estate agents
to get them to list their apart-
ments with us. Well write to
them and visit them." he explain-
ed.

The second greatest concern of
the Off—Campus Housing Office.
in Cowells opinion. will be edu-
cating students on the facts of
housing laws and codes and the
processes for filing complaints"
and withholding rent.

Cowell’s third concern will be
what he terms “educating land-
lords.”

"They just don‘t know what
students need or find attractive in
an apartment. For instance we wou
advise them to include desks and
proper lighting for reading." he
said.

Cowell will be assisted by a
full—time secretary. Mike Narke-
vic. He will also hire two students
to work part-time on a work-study
basis.

The Off-Campus Housing Office.
tentatively scheduled to open July
15. will be housed on the ground
floor of the Ruskin Apartments.

Poor Face Pinch

Tax Dilemma Returns

Governor Milton Shapp. who
pledged last year he would
veto a state income tax unac-

companied by tax reform. may

be forced to renege. due to a
recent ruling by the State Su-
preme Court.

Last Thursday. the Court de-
clared Pennsylvanias new 3.5 per
cent income tax unconstitutional.
because of provisions which case
the tax burden for poor people.
thereby simulating a graduated
income tax. 1

In Pennsylvania. a graduated
income tax is unconstitutional.

Shapp, who has yet to propose
a solution to the state’s latest fi-
nancial crisis, has huddled reg-
ularly over the past week with top
leaders of the State Legislature
and a reactivated tax reform
group.

He has also indicated that the
$135 million already collected un-
der the unconstitutional income
tax law will be credited to taxpay-
ers toward future tax payments.

FLAT TAX “PROBABLE”

Though no agreement has been
reached. some Harrisburg ob-
servers consider a flat income tax
——between 1.5 and 2 per cent and
without exemptions for the poor-
inevitable.

Houses Confer on Draft Law

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

A Senate - House Conference
Committee this week launched ef-
forts to hammer out a draft exten-
sion acceptable to both houses as
the Selective Service Act expired
today.

(Ken Coffey, Public Information
Officer of the Selective Service Sys-
tem said that because the draft has
not yet been extended, local boards
have issued no induction notices
for several weeks. Coffey said that
no men will be inducted until and if
the draft is extended.)

The 12-member committee -
five Senators. seven Representa-
tives —— must consider Senate- and
House—approved versions of a new
draft bill. Though each would ex-
tend the ilraft for two years. the
Senate version includes an
amendment urging President Nix-
on to end the war in Indochina by
a specified date.

According to legislative proce-
dure, a bill or resolution cannot be
presented to the President for sig-
nature into law until and unless it
has passed both houses of Con-
gress in identical form. When, as
in this case, a proposal passed by
one house is amended in the other,
and the initiating house is unwill-
ing to accept the amendment, a
conference committee _is created
to try and effect a compromise.

A majority of the delegates rep-
resenting each must must agree
to the conference report before it

p can be sent to the legislative

chambers.

Capitol observers are reluctant
to speculate as to what the confer-

ence committee will decide.
Spokesmen for Senators Mike
Mansfield (D.—Mon. 1. who propos-
ed the amendment to the draft bill
eventually passed by the Senate.
and John Stennis tD.—Miss. 1. floor
manager of the bill. would not
predict whether or not the com-
mittee would accept the Mans-
field Amendment.

A spokesman for the Demo-
cratic Policy Committee, how-
ever, told the Pitt News that
should the committee reject the
Mansfield Amendment, there is a
“. . . very strong possibility that
there will be an effort to kill the
bill in the Senate.“

Monday. Representative
Charles Whalen «R.-Ohio) intro-
duced a resolution that. if passed.
would have instructed House con-
ferees to agree to the Mansfield
Amendment. By a 219-176 vote.
the House defeated the motion.

The Mansfield Amendment
urges and requests the President to
terminate all military operations
in Indochina not later than nine
months following enactment of
the bill. This withdrawal would be
contingent upon the release of all
American prisoners in Indochina.

The Senate, which had consider-
ed the draft intermittently since
May 6, approved the two-year ex-
tension with the Mansfield
Amendment last Thursday. The
vote was 72-16.

A move to filibuster the bill into
oblivion or compromise was abort-
ed the day before when. by a 65-

17 margin. the Senate invoked
cloture (ended all debatetj

The cloture vote was supported
by many Southern Senators who
were doing so for the first time in
their legislative careers.

BULLETIN!

The New York Times reported yester-
day that the conference committee on the
draft is likely to recommend that students
who were freshmen in college prior to the
enactment of a new Selective Service law
be permitted to keep their deferments.
President Nixon had previously indicated
he would, if allowed, draft membe_rs of
the class of '74.

GOVERNOR SHAPP

According to Dick Parti. aide
to House Majority Leader K. Le-
roy Irvis. "a flat income tax is
probable.“

In Parti’s opinion, the Governor
and the Legislature “have no real
choice” but to go along with such
a tax.

Representative Irvis has al-

ready expressed that view.

"Were really disturbed by the
Court's ruling.“ Parti told the
Pitt News, “because the tax pack-
age we passed earlier was the
fairest possible."

POOR “HARDEST HIT” ,

Parti emphasized that 40 per
cent of Pennsylvania's wage-earn-
ers make less than $5.600 per
year. and stressed they would be
“the hardest hit" by a flat income
tax.

Expressing "regret" at ,
Courts decision. the Governors
legislative secretary. John Pitt-
inger. said the Governors legal
aides have not yet concluded
whether "some form of exemp-
tion for poverty" is still possible.

According to Parti, some Dem-
ocrats in the State Legislative
may balk at supporting an income
tax, unless Shapp promises them‘
patronage jobs to dispense as they
see fit.

Once the Governor proposes a
new tax. it will be considered by
the House and then the Senate.

HEW Clears Pitt On
7 Of 9 Charges

The Department of Health. Ed-
ucation. and Welfare cleared the
University in seven of nine cases
of sex discrimination charged by
the University Committee for
Women‘s Rights (UCWR).

In its report to the University.
HEW said that Pitt "was not us-
ing repressive measures to stifle
UCWR complaints of sex discrir'n-
mation." and did not attempt to
pressure women to leave their
jobs because of their women‘s
rights activities.

The federal agency further stat-
ed that "the allegations are for

the most part. a collection of un— ‘

toward experiences which some
of the UCWR members have had.
but in most instances they pre-
dated UCWR's campus activity or
could not be reasonably connected
with such activity.”

Stiident Interest Eh‘)?

The University Senate has voted
to do away with the two-day elec-
tion recess it approved a year ago
to allow students time to work in
political campaigns.

The Senate took the action by .

endorsing a report of its Student
Affairs Committee urging the dis-
continuance because of insuffi-
cient student interest.

Last year. Pitt suspended class-
es on election day and the preced-
ing day upon the recommendation
of the Senate. The time was made
up later in the academic calendar.

The Student Affairs Committee
chairman, Erma Meyerson of the
School of Education, told the Sen-
ate that the committee had want-

. ed to continue the recess because
it didn’t feel the last State-wide

election was a good test of student
interest.

But. site added. an informal fac-
ulty poll was “overwhelmingly in
favor of discontinuance.“ and a
sample survey of 500 graduate
and undergraduate students taken
by the Citizenship Information
Center (CIC) showed 80 students
in favor of continuing the two-day
recess. 141 opting for a one—day
recess. and 266 voting for no re-
cess.

For these reasons. Mrs. Meyer-
son said. the committee recom-
mended that the recess be elim-
inated but that the CIC be "en-
couraged and supported“ in it.s ef-
forts to raise the level of student
involvement in politics.

The door was left open for re-

However, the HEW investigative
team also found that “two women
have been denied equal pay and
promotional opportunities and
inequality is based upon sex and

does appear to tie in with their 1,

UCWR involvement.”

Therefore. HEW asked that
corrective action be taken. The
board requested that the two

women. June Rubel and Pat Rob— -

erts. receive back pay. and that
Ms. Roberts be reinstated to her
former position with the Univer-
sity and “be promoted to the first
available position commensurate
with her qualifications.“

Chancellor Wesley Posvar said
last Friday that the University
has “already ordered the remedi-_
al action required.

Senate Vote Sinks ElectionRecess

instating some form of election re-
cess if it appeared that students

would take a more active role in _

the political process.

The Senate vote to endorse the
committees report and recom-
mend discontinuance of the re-
cess was unanimous.

Jane Thompson. director of the
CIC. said that she agreed “in
part“ with the Senate‘s decision.

Apartments Purchased

The University has purchased

‘a group of apartment houses on

-Oakland Ave. and Atwood St. in
Oakland for investment purposes.

Announcement of the acquisi-
tions was made by Edison Mont-

 gomery, Vice Chancellor for Fi-

nance. who said the properties

' were purchased “as investments

of Pitt's endowment funds and are
in no way related to the Universi-
ty’s building program."

The properties are at the fol-

lowing addresses: 262-268, 294-
‘306, 310 and 318 Oakland Ave.;
261-265 and 305 Atwood St. The
dwellings were owned by several
related families for a number of
-years, Mr. Montgomery said. He
_added that the owners approach-
ed the University to buy their
properties.
 The present tenants of the apart-
ments will not be disturbed by
the acquisition. Mr. Montgomery
said, and they will be offered one-
year leases at present rental
rates.

“These are satisfactory invest-
”ments from a financial point of
view," Mr. Montgomery said.

Sickle Cell Society

Anemia Victims Aided

by RON LOZOWSKI

Over two million black people
in the United States have sickle
cells: most victims are unaware
of this fact.

The Sickle Cell Society. a re-
cently formed organization in
Pittsburgh. is trying to help area
victims.

Nathaniel Murray. president of
the society. explained the nature
of the disease. “Sickle cell dis-
ease. often called sickle cell ane-
mia. affects the red blood cells.
Normal red blood cells are round
and flat. The disease. however.
causes these cells to instead form
in the shape of sickles.“ he said.

“Sickle cells have sharp edges
and may break or clog up blood
vessels. These stopped up vessels
can be extremely painful. Such an
occurence is called a crisis, and
may cause ulcers that will nev-
er heal,” Murray stated.

Murray added, however. that
exact symptoms vary among in-
dividuals and complications may
range from an enlarged heart to
kidney infection and anoxia. He
further stated that “any cold
could turn to penumonia. because
these persons have a greater
susceptibility to infections.“

Murray pointed out that vic-
tims of the disease require fre-
quent transfusions of normal
red blood cells and that “these
persons are constantly tired and
often are unable to even work."
He added that, since such per-
sons may face difficulties in
meeting these costs, the Sickle
Cell Society tries to find donors
willing to offer their blood free
ofcharge.

Other functions of the society
include keeping victims informed
about their disease, as well as
helping them get job training and
good medical care. Murray ad-
mitted that, although the prob-
lem is being researched, at pre-
sent “there is no cure.”

Many persons who possess sick-
le cells do not actually have the
disease. but merely the trait. said
Murray. He explained. “Sickle
cell disease is inherited. When

 

 

D
"3t'l~.lI' (vii

$1.3? tt\n;y

  

both parents have sickle cells.
their children can inherit the dis-
ease. If only one person has sickle
cells. the children may inherit
the trait.“ ‘

Persons inheriting the trait
may feel quite well. although
they may tire more easily: than the
average individual. said Murray.
However. their main considera-
tion involves the possibilities of
their children having the disease.
Many children who inherit the dis-
ease do not live to become adults.

The disease effects blacks pri-
marily, although it may also be
found in other races. However,

‘to receive the test

the ancestry of non-black victims
is always, according to Murray,
traceable to the Mediterranean
area.

The blood tests administered
before marriage. or before enter-
ing the armed services. do not test
for sickle cells; a special test is
required. This test may cost in the
range of $25. However. the Sickle
Cell Society enables individuals
free of
charge. Interested individuals
may arrange for the test by
calling 682-1443. or by stopping in
at the Society at 4521 Centre Ave.

Laurenzano Despairs

by STEVE ZYCH

Robert Laurenzano. president of
the Pitt chapter of the Student
American Dental Association.
said he feels that the Dental
Schools new dress code is “high-
ly uncalled for and outrageous.“

LAURENZANO: Outraged, surprised.

The new dress code outlaws.
among other things: long side-
burns. mustaches below the lip.
hair below the eyebrows and col-
lar for males and V—neck tops and
colored underclothes (sic) for fe-
males in the school.

The code was written by the
Ethics Committee which theore-
tically includes four students on
its seven member panel. It was
formed at the request of Dean
Edward Forrest after dental

Over New Dress Code

student Robert Maier was sus-
pended. allegedly for wearing long
hair.

However, according to Lauren-
zano, at the meeting of the vote on
the dress code only two of the
four student representatives
were present. He also claims the
students were not told the com-
mittee was meeting.

"The decision of the commit-
tee was a complete surprise.“
Laurenzano said. "we «Student
American Dental Association»
were never informed about any
of this in advance.

He went on to note that "the
first time we heard anything def-
inite about this was when letters
were sent by the school inform-
ing us of the new rules which go
into effect in September. In other
words we were not informed in
advancef‘

Laurenzano also stated that the
dress code was taken from a nav-
al manual. “I question the use of
military ethics in the Dental
School. This is a civilian institu-
tion, not a branch of the Penta-
gon,” he declared.

Laurenzano commented that
“most of the people I’ve talked to
are highly upset by this unnec-
essary and ridiculous code.”

The night was sponsored by the
Student Consultant Project. a
group of graduate business stu-
dents that assists local merchants
in all areas of business.

Pat Reily. assistant director of
Purchases for the l7niversity.
encouraged black businessmen to
send him lists of their services so
that Pitt could do business with
them.

Robert LaVelle, a local realtor,
told of the trouble black business-
men face in getting adequate in-
surance for their property, es-
pecially insurance for burglary
and robbery. “Black business-
men have had an increasingly dif-
ficult task of obtaining insurance
since the riots of 1968,” said La-
Velle.

He also stated that those firms
that do offer insurance exploit
the small black businessman by
charging "exhorbitant rates."

The final speaker, James
Wimbush of the Internal Revenue
Service, outlined various tax aids
that his department has available
for small businessmen.

After the speeches. the meeting
broke up into small groups
where various aspects of business
previously mentioned were dis-
cussed in depth.

An Historic Episode

Times Disobeys, Government Lies

by ROBERT P. NEWMAN
Professor, Rhetoric

Three aspects of the surfacing of
the Pentagon papers strike me as parti-
cularly significant.

First, civil disobedience has reach-
ed an apogee of respectability. The
New York Times, most establishmen-
tarian of papers. has violated Federal
secrecy classifications. Appeals to First
Amendment freedoms and court deci-
sions forbidding prior restraints ‘on pub-
lication do not wash out the fact that
the Times violated a Federal statute.

The multitude of affadavits filed
by Times and Washington Post staffers
claiming’ that secrecy classifications
are farcical. that such classification are
honored more in the breach than in the
observance. that high Government offi-
cials ‘(even cabinet members and Pre-
sidents) violate them by leaking secret
materialwto reporters when it suits their
purposes, and that the press could not
function without these official leaks.
none of these affadavits obscures the
fact that the Times chose to violate the
law.

I support them in this violation.
They should have done it before. In
a‘ number of previous instances. the
Times chose not to go to press with stor-
ies containing classified material which
they had dug up on their own. and the

. country was the worse for it.

For instance, the Times possessed,
“classified" information
about U-2 overflights of Russia in the
weeks before Gary Francis Powers was
downed.

Who is to say what cold war male-
volence might have been obviated had
the 'Times carried this story and the
flights been cancelled?

Why Tuition

by MIKE HALEY
Staff Columnist

Dear Chancellor Posvar.

A minican

Before the Bay of Pigs fiasco. the
Times possessed, and almost printed, a
story laying bare exact details of the
plans: even Kennedy later told Times
officials that printing of this story
might have spared the United States
great trauma.

In the present case. verification of
official chicanery and presidential
mendacity is all to the good. The myth
of the benevolent. "textbook“ President
can stand some debunking. The Times
should have published these documents.
and in the event it is prosecuted for so
doing. it should make the strongest le-
gal case possible for the desirability of
its action on the basis of the public
right to know. the absence of clear
danger from publishing. and the gener-
al disarray of the classifications proce-
dures. -

But I agree with Roger Fisher. writ-
ing in the Times of June. 22 that it
is silly for the Times to pretend that it
broke no laws or that the First Amend-
ment nullifies the acts establishing
classified materials.

Candor is a more fitting posture
here than injured innocence; the Times
has joined a long and honorable list
of those who have chosen to deliber-
ately disobey shoddy laws which are
inequitably enforced. and it should
acknowledge this openly.

* * *

Second, those who are surprised or
shocked by the contents of the Penta-
gon papers have ‘only themselves to
blame. It has all been in the media.
all along, for‘ those who had eyesto
read and ears to hear. The massive
and sustained deception of the Johnson
administration surfaced with the Do-
intervention of- April, 1965.

Hike?

“I am sorry to report to you that" I received your let-
ter informing students of the likelihood that the University's
tuition will be increased again this fall. While I know your

decision is not final, I can surmise that you‘ll probably

raise tuitions to about $970 a year.

I agree that "any tuition increase would place an enor-
mous burden on students and their parents with the total
cost for each year of college education amounting to as

as 20% of an average family's income."

Almost before the

which was accurately exposed by Sen-
ators Fulbright and Clark. and driven
home by Theodore Draper in the De-
cember. 1965 Commentary.

Senators Morse and Gruening. in
addition to the newsmen. applied the
same unmasking techniques to Vietnam.
Even as early as 1963. David Halber-
stain and others exposed such phony
Government claims as the "victory” at
Ap Bac.

Body counts of enemy dead were
known to be fraudulent. Bombing the
I palpably ineffective in
achieving its objectives despite official
claims.

The August 4. 1964 incident in the
Gulf of Tonkin was shown in a num-
ber' of publications to have been a
fiction. seized by Johnson after the
August 2 attack (which did occur. and
was provoked by us) as the basis for his
"declaration of war." The whole opera-
tion was shot through with phoniness:
the only light at the end of that tun-
nel was in the eyes of the official be-
holders.

Furthermore, the media were not
bashful about exposing the general un-
truthfulness of the President; he lied.
not just about the big things, but about
the little things: about the speed at
which he drives, about an ancestor
claimed to have died at the Alamo of
whom no one can find a record, about
the place where he was born. about
the numerous appointments he was
about to make but denied when his
intention leaked.

By 1968, the very sober Freedom of
Information and Press-Bar Committee
of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors could publicly observe that
coping with Administration falsehoods

under LBJ was “immeasurably more
difficult because official deceit is
practiced both when there is reason for
it and when there is not."

Who had not been warned that the
whole fabric of our intervention in Viet-
nam was a tissue of lies? Only the deaf
and blind.

* * *

Third. despite the probable addi-
tional damage to LBJ‘s reputation due
to publication of these papers. the inci-
dent is not likely to have a salutary ef-
fect on the credibility of President Nix-
on.

Mendacity is not. with Nixon. as
it may have been with LBJ. a patholo-
gical state; it is merely a habit.

When the chips are down, we will
still get the “pitiful, helpless giant"
syndrome. Future San Jose incidents
will still be exaggerated, distorted. mis-
represented. Future lurches into Cam-
bodia will again be painted, not as
opportunities to shore up a non-Com-
munist government, but as "protecting
the lives of American boys."

Long drawn out disengagement will

- continue to be justified as "winning

the peace" rather than a last-ditch ef-
fort to preserve our Saigon clients. ,

Richard Nixon, too, will need to
nail his coonskin to the wall, but in
Wall Street board room rather than
Texas cattle ranch accents. The pub-
lic relations requirement for making the
home team look good will remain in-
exorably in force. Both individual and
bureaucratic disposition to sanitize the
news will continue unabated.

The Government is. and will contin-
ue to be, in matters where prestige and
reputation are at stake. a crude liar.

But from here on, Chancellor, we disagree. since I
have lost faith in your promises. In your letter last year,
when you informed us that our tuitions were increased $70
per term, you promised, "We will do everything we can
to keep future student charges to a minimum. In setting
the present rates, we have taken the maximum risk consis-
tent with good management practice to provide education

at the lowest possible cost."

Do you consider $970 the “lowest possible cost?" Do
you really believe a $120-a-year tuition increase keeps “fu-
ture student charges to a minimum?“ I know it is with
“great regret" that you alerted us to these possibilities. But

is that enough? .

The State has to deal with the problems of unemploy-
ment, deterioration of the cities, pollution, drug addiction,
and rising taxes. Pitt and higher education are no longer

first in line in this long list of priorities.

So there is no longer any infinite reservoir of state
monies we can receive to subsidize all of Pitt‘s expenses.
Yes, Chancellor, there is no longer any Santa Claus.

Blaming the Legislature and the Governor is really.
then, a waste of breath. Therefore who's to blame for the

skyrocketing costs of higher education?

I think it‘s the system's fault. because the university is
not a place where “good management" is practiced. The
faculty teaches in general from 6 to 9 hours a week. and
they think that constitutes full time employment.

According to a study by Dr. Mark Perlman of the Eco-
nomics department, who worked on the Professorial Teach-
ing Productivity Committee. there are ways of increasing

productivity and thus reducing costs.

But there is no viable action taken to make the Depart-

ments more productive.

Chancellor, why don't you discuss these problems in
your letters to us. instead of passing the buck to the state?
Exactly where are the costs of education increasing‘? What
you are doing to keep the costs of our education down‘?

dry on his appointment to the
position of Dean of Student De-
velopment, the office was abo-
ﬁshed.

Now, Montgomery can add to
that blow to his pride a pain in
his posterior. Last week, he was
bodily evicted from a meeting
of the U.S. Office of Education
Institute, Crisis: Women in
Higher Education.

As far as Montgomery or any-
body else knows. this was the
first time a University adminis-
trator has been quite literally
thrown out of a meeting. He
was still “quite surprised. quite
disgusted" about the incident
Tuesday.

Liberalism Affronted

"This is absolutely contrary to
the principles of a free and
open society, a liberal univer-
sity," he said.

Montgomery said his motives
for attending the meeting were
honest —— he wanted to hear the
women’s grievances. According
to a terse, 98-word memo issued
by the Institute, attendance at
Institute meetings is limited to
“participants, staff, and speak-

Two Versions

The discussion began and pick-
ed up momentum. “One of the
participants," reads the memo,"
then chaired the discussion. A
motion was made to request that
Dr. Montgomery leave. The mo-
tion carried by majority vote
with no opposition."

Again, Montgomery refused to
budge.

“Finally," says the memo,"
Dr. Montgomery was approach-
ed by several Institute partici-
pants and removed from the
room.

Montgomery’s description of
the eviction is more graphic:
"Four or six women very gently
lifted me off the chair—I was
very limp and they had to bear
the full weight of my body. They
picked me up and dropped me in
the hallway.“

Montgomery said he had no
doubts about who was behind his
precipitate exit — the one who

stitute Director Dr. Konnilyn
Feig.

These are questions I would like to see answered in
your future letters to students. What we need is leadership.

Institute members for “political"
purposes.

“Itwould be naive to think
that this (personal animosity) did
not play a part,“ said Montgo-
mery. -

There may be something to
Montgomery’s explanation. If
it is an Institute policy to limit
attendance at its sessions to par-
ticipants, staff, and speakers it
is an inconsistent one. At least
one outsider has attended at
least one previous meeting.

Cool Relations

And the cool relations between
Montgomery and Feig are no se-
cret.

Institute members will not
elaborate on their cursory memo.
They said they feel that the un-
animity of their vote relieves any

single participant of individual

responsibility for bouncing Mon-
tgomery. ‘

Still, one must wonder just
what is going on at the Institu-
te that must be guarded so zeal-
ously. “Perhaps they thought I
was a spy from Chancellor Pos-
var,” mused Montgofnery.

Perhaps that would be a good
idea-send a spy into the Institute
to steal its secrets for the waiting
world.

Unless he got caught. If the
penalty for eavesdropping is a
quick hook. the sentence for trea-
son could be a hasty dispatch.

”Don’t Lead Us By the Hand”

Editor:

Recently the Administration of the School of Dental Medicine
presented to its students a new code of appearance and conduct.
Now what makes this codeappalling is not that I cannot wear flow-
ered bikini underwear. since I personally prefer white jockey shorts.
but rather the fact that it represents only a small part of the ice-
berg of strangling conservatism found at the school.

The administration and their handpicked model students feel
that they must remind the rest of the student body to wear deodor-
ant and bathe daily. By trying to lead each student (some of whom
have only reached the age of 35) by the hand. they have led the
school into a vast wasteland void of imagination, creativity, and in-
dividuality.

A state of paranoia exists in which very few. if any. people
with authority can be trusted to uphold a student's individual rights.

Student sympathizers in the faculty are also apprehensive to
support the students against unjust treatment because of fear of re-
prisal from the administration. Each ’year an uncommon number
of faculty, who are aware and concerned with the student’s plight,
leave the University for other positions.

The administrations attempt to elevate dentistry out of the
shadows of mediocrity to the position of respect that medicine
holds in society today has only gone further to enhance the stereo-
type of the dentist as a mindless technician rather than an individ-
ual member of the health profession team capable of speaking his
own mind.

Activities Fee: A Means for College Experiences

Editor:

I read a letter composed by D.
R. Stanton. Law. ‘74. in the June
24 issue of the Pitt News that ex-
pressed firm opposition to any in-
crease in the activities fee and,
or even the activities fee itself. I
was very much saddened to real-
ize that a fellow Pitt student was
willing to openly admit he viewed
the fee as an "obsolete tax on
many for the benefit of very. very
few.

Perhaps Mr. Stanton doesn‘t
realize the fuller meaning of what
it is to be a Pitt student. To
quote from one Pitt bulletin. “Pitt
fosters the concept of the stu-
dent as a whole person in a so-
ciety. This last goal requires
more than academic efforts.
Thus. the University encourages
students to participate in a varie-
ty of activities outside the class-
room."

Maybe one of the problems we
don't realize about the activities
fee hassle is the Douglas Stantons
of Pitt. There will always be those
individuals who stand outside Da-
vid Lawrence Hall complaining
about “a small minority of stu-

dents who take part in activities to-
day" while other students go in-
side and participate in viewing
movies, hearing rock groups, etc.

Increased fees would mean an
increase in activities in quantity
and in better groups and mid-
night flicks.

Perhaps these students who
wish no activities fees or at least
no increased fees do not realize
the services this fee provides for
their voluntary use—do they read
the Pitt News, participate in cam-

pus organizations. attend the
"midnight movies." go to plan-
ned activities such as “freak

week." or do they sit at home with
either a good book in their hand
(or a text book. assuming text-
books do get read before the night
before the "big test“) or watch-
ing television.

I realize that some students
cannot participate in all the ac-
tivities provided for by the activ-
ities fee due to obligations such
as families. work. or other en-

buddy rich morcher

deavors. but the person who
comes to Pitt merely to attend
class and then jumps into a bus
or car and rides away at the end
of his day loses more of his col-
lege experience than he can possi-
bly gain.

Then too. maybe those students
don't realize that such campus
groups as the Commuter Associa-
tion are not only helping to elim-
inate meter maid phobia and solv-
ing the problem of bus stands.

But such organizations are
funded through the levy of activ-
ities fees.

Maybe you don't realize it. Mr.
Stanton. but somehow. some-
where. those fees you pay so re-
luctantly each term are serving
to make your Pitt career easier
and more rewarding.

Led by their captain and lead-
ing scorer Willi Lippens who
scored a sensational total of six
goals. the Essen team of Ger-
many mauled the West Penn
All Stars by the ‘score of 14 —

The game which was played

group of local amateurs called
the West Penn All Stars.

This was demonstrated early
in the game. Fullback Gunther

to throw a touchdown pass with
only 31 seconds left to secure
a West victory. ’

Hixson's pass to Joe Orduna
of Nebraska covered_23 yards.
In that drive. the Southern Me-
thodist ace covered 57 yards in
five plays on four passes and
a three yard running play.

Alabama’s Scott Hunter had
given the East a 28-26 lead just
seconds earlier with a three yard
touchdown scamper.

The East balanced its scoring
in the four quarters with six
points in the first quarter. eight
in the second. and seven points
in both the third and fourth
quarters. In fact. they threaten-
ed to turn the game into a rout
early in the third quarter un-
til Jim Plunkett. Heisman
Trophy winner and first round
draft choice of the Boston Pa-
triots. arrived on the scene to
give the West 18 of 19 third
quarter points.

Plunkett‘s three touchdowns in
eleven minutes gave the West a
26-21 lead into the fourth quar-
ter.

‘ Hunter passed 57 yards for
one touchdown, to complement
his three yard run. Mike Adamle
of Northwestern accounted for
two East touchdowns, with runs
of one and 16 yards.

J. T. Hill of Arizona scored
the Wests first touchdown on a
73 yard punt return.

Hall. who was the third round
choice of the Green Bay Pack-
ers. has yet one more all star ap-

college career. aside from the

Theofilos also assisted Aquir-

minutes later when one of their
fullbacks kicked the ball into

  Banner Grabs Eight

Top Track Prospects

By VINCE DiNARDO

Now that the track season is
over until the fall. track coach
Jim Banner has concentrated his
efforts on the recruiting end of
the coaching job. Judging from
the list that Banner has accumu-
lated, the track team should
have a lot of depth coming in to
replace the outgoing talent. S

Of Banners eight top recruits.
four of them boast state cham-
pionships in their respective
events. Also. Banner has gather-
ed two WPIAL champions and
one city League champ. as well
as a Prep school champ-

New York State champion hur-
ler Andre Harris will be a wel-
come addition to both Rick
Caroselli and Ted Bobby. the
present hurdlers. and will give
the hurdling group a great
amount of mobility-

Harris brings with him out-
standing credentials. In New
York, he ran the low" hurdles
in 19.1 and the high hurdles in
14.0.

Mike Collins. the Pennsylvan-
ia State champion miler. comes
to Pitt with credentials similar
to those of Jerry Richey four
years ago. Aside from his mile
winning form. Collins has run
the two-mile in times as low
as 9:08.0.

Tom Steele. the WPIAL two-
mile champ has also been added
by Banner.

Bob Schurko, brother of thin-
clad Mike Schurko and WPIAL
mile champ, will also bring
more versitility to the Banner-
men. Both the State champ and
the WPIAL mile champions will
be coming here-

Banner pulled a similar coup

Having spent my first two sea-
sons in theatre working on the
summer tent circuit. I was par-
ticularly at home at the rather
interesting theatre called Odd
Chair Playhouse on the opening
night of the musical-comedy Cele-
bration.

The theatre is a metal tent. so
to speak. with sides adjustable to
either preserving the atmosphere
of a solid structure or letting in
the cool night air. The seats are
«as the name of the theatre im-
plies) odd and of various sorts.
looking down on a stage area
which is flexible for almost any
._. pe of setting.

The atmosphere is not quite the
pure delight of the summer tet
theatre but catches enough of the
casual “cool” excitement of that
particular type of theatrical pa-
lace to make it, with its rather
interesting and varied line-up of
shows, a good bet for an evening
that's just a little different and
very much fun.

The ppening show of the season
is a musical comedy entitled
‘Celebration written by the Tom
Jones-Harvey Schmidt team that
penned the long running off-
Broadway musical The Fantas-
ticks. Celebration had a mild run

 ‘S? New York and quickly found its
way into the summer circuit where
with proper casting and good direc-
tion. it has the potential of being
a better than average theatrical
vehicle.

The common threads between
the two shows are most evident in
plot. music. and lyrics. but un-
fortunately Celebration comes no
where near to matching the
charm. depth in plot. or emotion-
al recall that The Fantastiks does.

Even though the score is large-
ly “just. pleasant” with only a few
bright moments here and there
(“My Garden” for example) and
the book rather thin and unre-
markable, the performances of
KDKA’s Jim Horne and Play-

house student Lenora Nemetz not
only lit up the little theatre but
caused sparks of theatrical ex-
citement at such great pace that
over 3/4 of the show bounced
along with hilarious speed. In es-
sence it's a one character show
tMr- Rich a la Jim Horne) and
this is where a major weakness of
thebooklies.

Lenora Nemetz t.-Xngel) is un-
doubtedly the most talented
yoimg female performer in the
Pittsburgh area. She sparkleswith
a polish and yersatality that
exudes from every angle—wheth-
er it‘s the delightful and lovable
expressions that one sees on her
face and hears in her delivery or
the swift and well-timed move-
ments of her dancing feet. She. in
fact- has so much going for her
that with a little more training I
might just be tempted to make
her half my reason for going to
see anything she's in.

This is the first time l‘ve seen
Jim Horne and I’m happy for that.
He has a comical delivery that’s as
rounded and timed as a well—oil—
ed time bomb. When he hits his
mark. he knows it—you know it—
and everybodys caught. He‘s
there when he's needed 99 per
cent of the time and because of
that the laughter was unmistak-
ably his ovation.

The remainder of the cast is
largely apprentices from around
town. Most look familiar from
the Playhouse. and most are still
“perfecting their thing” but com-
ing along quite nicely at it. The
chorus was better than I thought
it would be,but still “in perfec-
tion."

The dancers were about the
same. but with some better than
average choreography (Tom
Thomas. Lenora Nemetz) for this
area: most of the numbers came
off in fine spirit.

Wayne Darby Cook as Potem-
kin and Paul Greeno as the Or-
phan were pleasant in their roles

direct (No Strings and Guys and

Slick Cinemtt Smlisiit
Pervudes “Lighthouse”

by STEVE ZYCH

Much of Jules \'erne's work has
been successfully adapted for the
screen by Hollywood. e.g. 20,000
Leagues Under the Sea, Mysteri-
ous Island, and Five Weeks in a
Balloon. Now the Spanish have
entered this profitable game with
the gaudiest and goriest of the
genre called Lighthouse at the
Edge of the World.

  
 

The flick. currently .featured at
the Fiesta Theater. features Kirk

Douglas t\\‘l]0 also starred in
20,000 Leagues in 1956). Yul
Brynner. and Samantha Eggar.
Douglas portrays a self-exiled
American who mans a lonel_v
lighthouse on South America‘s

1865. He is pursued by a pervert-
ed pack of pirates headed by Yul
Brynner. who cant decide if he
is recreating the role of the Buc-
caneer or the mad monarch in
The King and I. Br_vnner manages
to be menacingly evil enough and
that is what this slick piece of
cinematic sadism is all about.

The film depicts almost every
evil imaginable, thus leaving lit-
tle to the viewer’s fantasy. How
the movie received a GP (all
ages) rating, while soapy schlock
like Love Story was rated R is
beyond me. The film outdoes any
violent film I’ve ever seen, with
the possible exception of the per-
verted and propagandistic Sol-
dier Blue. And I’ve been an avid
action film buff for many moons.

Part of the reason for the vio-
lence lies in the fact that it was
filmed in Almeria. Spain. where
the spicy spaghetti Westerns were
first ground out. and the influence
is horribly visible.

Direction by Kevin Billington is
totally unrestrained. as is the
screenplay by Tom Rowe. Acting
is limited to Douglas. who is his
usual professional self. while
Brynner appears bored by it all.
Samantha Eggar as the female
lead seems confused at best.

The real stars of the film are
the buccaneers, who are easily
the motliest menagerie of mur-
derous marauders I’ve ever wit-
nessed. They are portrayed real-
istically in all their barbaric
cruelty and banality—a far cry
from the bewildered hues of Pe-
ter Pan.
