Nixon's Non-compliance

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

By ﬂatly refusing Wednesday to
comply with‘ the House Judiciary
Committee's subpoena for 11
Watergate related tapes, or any
future subpoena President Nixon
has invoked a critical constitutional
confrontation which could swiftly
lead to a vote on his impeachment
in the’House of Representatives.

With his adamant refusal, in a
letter to the Committee chairman,
Peter W. Rodino, .Ir., Nixon said
the decision applied to "such

' further subpoenas as may hereafter:

be issued." The panel. ‘after the
White House ignored its request
last month for 141 tapes. had
pub_lically stated it would issue a
series of subpoenas for the
requested material.

The 11 conversations. the first in
the expected series of subpoenas.
included discussions the President
conducted with his aides on days
immediately following the breakin

 

at the Democratic National Com-
mittee in June, 1972. The
Committee hoped to learn from
these conversations whether the

President was aware of the breakin .

before it happened or if he was a
part of the initial coverup.

In a written answer to the
subpoena delivered by Nixon’s
chief defense lawyer,James D. St.
Clair to Rodino, the
wrote, “It is clear that the
continued succession of demands
for additional conversations has
been a never ending process, and
that to continue providing these
conversations in reponse to the
constantly escalating request
would constitute such a massive
invasion into the confidentiality of
presidential conversations, that the
institution of the presidency itself
would be fatally compromised.”

BY RITA VITOLO
The US Supreme Court, ruling
last month in a four to five split,

- refused to decide whether profes-

sional schools can constitutionally
give preference in "admissions to

. members of racial minority groups

at the expense of similarly-qual-
iﬁed white applicants.
Sidestepping the issue of “re-
verse discrimination"--providing
special treatment in education and
employment» to racial minorities,

depriving whites of judgement_on

their own merits--the Court put off
indeﬁnitely a decision on the
legality of specialized minority
admission practices.

The Court tabled the case,
claiming there was no longer a live
controversy requiring a decision, as

— the University of Washington law

student who had filed the suit to
gain admission to law school will
graduate from that school in June
regardless "of the decision.

The suit was brought by Marco
DeFunis Jr., against University of
Washington President Charles
Odegaard in 1971 after the
University's failure to admit him.
DeFunis claimed that three dozen
minority applicants with Law
School Admissions Test scores and
academic ratings lower than his,
had been admitted. , ,

A Seattle trial court upheld
DeFunis's contention that his
constitutional right to equal pro-
tection of the laws had been denied
by the school's admissions proce-
dure. and he was subsequently
In an effort
to protect its admissions practices,
the University appealed the de-
cision to the Washington State
Supreme Court and won a reversal,
claiming whites with both higher
and lower scores than DeFunis's
had been admitted, and contending
that DeFunis's race had not figured
in the original decision to reject
him.

In his separate dissent; to the
Supreme Court decision, Associate
Justice William O. Douglas said he
believed the Washington ad-
mission practices were unconstitu-
tional because they were based on
race.

grounds were valid if they were
granted without respect to race.

University Secretary Consultant
Otto Nelson. I

Nelson said although the Uni- ,

versity is generally against tuition
increases. “this position was
‘founded on studies that said the

ideal amount for a student to pay \

toward’ the total cost of his
education was between one third
and one half. Medical and Dental

students are only paying about’

10%. They're paying a smaller
share than the typical under-
graduate. When they get out, their
incomes are substantially greater.”

Students, of course,’ are against
the increases, “We don't like it,”
said Student American Medical

Joseph Abramovitz.

Pitt Dorm Lifestyle Opinions Expanded

BY ANDREA ZIPF

The Alternatives in Lifestyles
program will-be expanded this fall
to provide additional opportunity
for compatible relationships be-
tween resident students of similar
interests, according to Residence
Life Coordinator Marian Hirst.

The program provides various

‘ living areas for specific academic

programs, such as Health Related
Professions and Alternative Cur-
riculum, and for particular social
patterns, such as Intensive Study
Area and Sorority Units.

 

 

Hirst said several new units are
being added for the fall including a
Spanish Culture Unit, a French
Culture Unit. a Graduate Unit, a
Reduced Visitation Unit, and a
Freshman Seminar Unit.

The two language units are
located in Brackenridge Hall and
are designed to aid the student in
increasing his or her knowledge of
the language. customs, foods and
peoples of the culture. Each unit
will work closely with its respective
language department.

' The Graduate Unit will _‘be

 

located in the Nurses Residence
and was established for those
graduates who felt out of place in
the undergraduate dorms. “They

have different interests and out-‘

looks than the undergraduates and
requested a place of their own,”

said Assistant Coordinator Joann .

Woodson.

Two floors in Tower B will house ’

the new Freshman Seminar Unit,

He also sees the want of a
balance in payment as a factor in
the Board's decision. “One of the
reasons for the increases was to
remedy an alleged inequity con-
cerning the amount of tuition Med
and Dent students pay as opposed
to other schools. I don_’t believe
that inequity is as objectional as it

The STudent Government Board
(SGB) last night refused to fund
Pitt Radio station WPGH’s ex-
ploration into the possibility of FM
broadcasting because of uncer-
tainties concerning the location of
the transmitter.

The FM antenna must be at least
three miles from that of Carnegie-
Mellon's in order to prevent
interference, ‘said WPGH member
Lee Moses. The only plausible
antenna site, he said, seems to be
Mt. Washington, which at ﬁve
miles from Pitt may be too far for
good campus reception.

“We feel the antenna will reach
Oakland, but we won't know for
sure unless we apply for the [FCC]
license,” said Moses. ‘‘There’s
also a possibility we could get a
waiver on the FCC ruling and then
we could put the antennaup near
Trees Hall,” he added.

SGB members remained ada-
mant, saying they wanted’to be
certain Pitt would definitely get an

s

member Bruce Keeler.

“No, we can't find out until we
get the money and apply for the
license." replied Moses.

Gay'Students at Pitt [GSP] and
WPGH appealed room assign-
ments later at the meeting. After
lengthy discussion, GSP agreed to
share room 317 in the Student
Union with the Undergraduate
Women’s Union [UWU]. UWU

The failure of the members of Student Government Board to petition
the athletic department for funding of the Pitt Hockey Club is an

i J. irresponsible and outrageous abrogation of their obligation to the club

and to the students at this campus.

The Board denied the Hockey Club funds on March 27 because
funding of the club through the activities fee would deter the
development of the organization. Student Government said the club
deserved the support of the athletic department, and their move to cut
funds was aimed at forcing the athletic department to pledge this
deserved support. The Pitt News agreed.

The Hockey Club was the topic of discussion last month at the Senate
Athletic Committee. However, since the Board’s vote two long months
ago, Student Government representatives have had no meetings with

‘administrative olﬁcials, including Athletic Director Casmir Myslinski
to discuss the club’s future. ’

President Mike Furick and representatives of the Hockey Club met
with Myslinski before the Board’s vote to deny funding to discuss
University funding of the club. Myslinski refused, then, to fund the
Hockey Club.

When voting to deny funding, Board member, Pat Kablach said,
Myslinski might fund the club if Student Government ﬂatly refused to
fund the organization. This apparently would force the Athletic
Department to sustain the Hockey Club's existence.

But now the Board is doing nothing to seek funding for the
organization because the administration wants nothing to do with the

‘Hockey Club, according to the Student Government President.

Mike Eirick, spokesman of the Student Government Board, has

We must conclude, still that the Hockey Club is deserving of funds
which would permit its existence and expansion on campus. The
Hockey Club should not receive only the minimal funding available
through the student activities fee, but full ﬂedged support from Pitt’s
Athletic Department.
H Student Government had a responsibility to do everything possible
in achieving this goal when it denied the organization funding.

The Board now should contemplate meeting this commitment and i

try to secure Athletic Department funding for the Hockey Club. Or it
should shirk this responsibility and fund the club for one more year.

  Drowning

Denouncemenl oi theWoiergote 

BY CAL RITCHEY

The denouement at the Water-
gate in Washington, DC, will soon
be two years old. and the ripples
caused by the initial splash have
already literally circled the world.
Now‘ the tidal wave is returning to

- its source: Washington is about to

be inundated.

President Nixon is a drowning
man. and from almost anybody's
viewpoint, there is noone who can
throw him a rope. His closest aides
--Dean, _Mitchell, I-laldeman.
Ehrlichman--are too closely
involved in the affair to be of any
assistance.

Now the President has perhaps
severed, with his own words, his
last chance. Put out by his own

_orders, the transcripts of the tapes

subpoenaed by the Committee on
the Judiciary of the House of
Representatives on April 11, 1974,
have shown the President to be
deeply involved in at least the
Watergate coverup, if only after
the fact. It was the President’s
hope that public reaction to the
transcripts would be in his favor.
Unfortunately, for him, this is not
the case.

President Nixon has been shown
to be a man like any other:

normally. /this might not be a-

9

“negative quantity‘ as John Dean
might put it. but the public does
not want to see their President
revealed in all his inadequacies.

More than anything else. such a’

revelation will ultimately hurt

Nixon more than help his cause.
But. callous asit may seem, it is
not what happens to Nixon. the
man, that is important now. Nixon.
after all. is only a man. and no man
is indispensable. There are
probably a thousand men who
could replace Nixon or any other
governmental official. The true
importance of the Watergate-re
lated events is their effect on the
Presidency and the country.
Future Presidents will be faced
with a dilemma: should they
record their conversations, know-
ing that a subpoena may occur.
And if they do not record any
conversations, will they be chas-
tised for this ommission? Will
heads of foreign governments talk
freely, knowing that what they say
may not be as priveleged as they
once believed? Granted, it was Mr.
Nixon’s decision to release the

tapes to the public, but the
question is still present.
Anyone who has read the

transcripts knows that at least one
former President was discussed,
adversely, by President Nixon and
friends. This confirms what.many
people have suspected for years:
that some politicians are a little bit
crooked in one way or another.
Perhaps the job of President will,
in_ the not too distant future,
become distasteful to men who are
capable of handling the position. It
may become distasteful either
because it has been tarred with the
brush of criminality. or because it

is (shameful thought!) no longer
possible to be criminal within the
ofllce. In this event, perhaps the
job will be filled by drawing the
short straw - the loser gets the post
for four years. or eight or whatever.

The most serious problem,
however, is the internal dissension
which will be--and is beginning to
be--caused by the politics of
impeachment. lf Nixon stood up on
national. television and admitted
full complicity in every bank
robbery or two-bit burglary in the

last five years, there would be

those loyal Republicans, and
possibly a few Democrats, who
would defend him as the victim of
“dirty politics.”

Even to the casual observer and
registered independent there is
some question who is behind the
Watergate sty. Certainly it is not
the American people. They have
never before had enough power to
start or-stop top-level manipula-

tions. and there is no rea‘son.tov

believe that the people have
suddenly acquired such power.

A national news magazine last
week projected an impeachment
decision for September 1974, on a
rough timetable. September 1974
is too far away but it is probably a
fair estimate. unless Nixon steps
down.
could be considered an impeach-
able offense for him to remain in
office and put the United States
through the turmoil of a long, hot
summer.

  Letters to the Editor

Discrimination

Dear Editor:

Discrimination is a sticky busi-
ness. It often occurs silently. with
no one aware of its happening,
when an organization or body takes
no stand on an issue. It is this kind
of sticky discrimination that the
University practices with homo-
sexuals.

' How often are gay dorm students
hassled by fellow students in the
dorms and cafeterias while the
University does nothing but watch
quietly? How often are gay
students discriminated against by
professors while the University
pretends not to see? How often are
gay students turned away from
certain departments or fields of
study because of their sexual
preferences? How many profes-
sors are not hired because they are
gay; how many gay professors are
forced to remain closet-bound for

questions must unfortunately be
left unanswered because this silent
discrimination has tied the hands
and gagged the ‘mouth of the
University.

_We, the members of the Gay

. Students at Pitt, demand that the

University break free of its knots
and take a stand on its‘ policies
regarding homosexuality. We
hope that this stand will be
positive, with the goal of ending
such malicious discrimination. If it

Dear Editor:

1. Allen Phillips, a very needy
student in CA5 has been deter-
mined "by those in authority and
‘knowledge’ as not needing aid."
This  absurd  well as
adminisrative BULLSHIT! My
father and I made a combined 1973
income of approximately
$15,500.00. Now with four children
in my family, plus both parents.
this is not enough to pay for my
education. This university is so
screwed (lwas informed that I could
not use the street term for
"screwed." This university. as
any institution of higher learning,
should be looking out for the
welfare of the students. There are
only three things that this
university is looking out for:
obtaining as much money from
students  is humanly possible.
the faculty and their own salary. an
last. but definitely not least. the

‘I

football players, who up until this
year were not worth one cent! A
college's purpose is not to pay
students to go to school simple
because they can play a good game
of football,_ no matter how
intellectually deprived they are.
Scholarships should be awarded
PURELY on INTELLECTUAL
ABILITY and NEED! If they are so
hep on playing footbal, let them
play for nothinglllll

My plead will probably - go
unheeded because I dare to rock
the boat, but! would like to see the
money wasted on jocks used for
intellectuals. I would also like to
know if those with the authority
have the» balls to show how much
money was paid to each’ player over
a ten-year period and print it in the
Pitt News! I know that they won't,
and if they did, they would not
show all of the money paid to each
player! This you can be sure of!!
Give the money where it belongs-in
the hands of needy intellectuals
and not in the hands of muscles
with little or no brains. (Those of
you jocks that are intelligent,
please do not takeythis personally!)

Let the voice of the‘ people be

‘Star Trek: Log One’ in preview

SPOCK

BY KEN MINARIK

Star Trek : Log One

by Allan Dean Foster

Science Fiction; Ballantine Books
#24014 First Printing - June 1st,
1974

In less than two weeks Ballantine
Books will begin mass distribution
of the latest aspect of
continuing Star Trek phenomenon -
a 184 page book entitled Star Trek
Log One. An advance copy has
found its way to this writer's desk,
and needless to say, it is delightful.

Star Trek : Log One is not to be
confused with the popular Star
Trek series of paperbacks pub-
lished by rival publisher Bantam
books.

By now, anyone who has ever
entered a book store has noticed
the Star Trek paperbacks.

Consisting of old television scripts’ '

adapted by James Blish, the first
ten Star Trek books have sold over
4 1/2 million copies, an average
500,000 copies each and an
amazing set of figures for any
paperback, let alone a collection of
hastily gathered television scripts.

Star Trek : Log One is a careful
rewriting and skillful blend of the
first three Star Trek Animated
television scripts.

Yes, for those of you that don't
know, Star Trek is now a Saturday
morning kiddies show. According
to Cecil Smith of the Los Angeles

the.-

 

Times, “NBC's new animated Star
Trek is...fascinating fare. written.
produced and executed with all the
imaginative skill. the intellectual
flare and the literary level that
made Gene Roddenberry's famous
old science-fiction epic the most
avidly followed program in TV
history."

Star Trek : Log One is ideal for
the weekday afternoon Star Trek
fan, like myself, who doesn’t get a
chance or simply can’t stand to
watch the Saturday morning
animated show. The scripts of the
animated shows are good; the only
problem is, they keep getting
butchered down in order to be
sandwiched between Saturday
morning toy commercials.

and write well. Star Trek : Log One
is good science fiction with
excellent transition and superior
translation from Saturday morning
kiddie talk to quality fiction.

Of course. Foster has had help.
The authors of these first three
animated scripts are Star Trek
veterans.

Samual A. Peeples. who wrote
the animated premiere, “Beyond
the Farthest Star'_' is also the
author of the original Star Trek
premiere that was shown eight
years to the day before the

The second animated show,
“Yesteryear." was authored by D.
C. Fontana. author or co-author of
at least nine of the original Star
Treks. “Yesteryear" is a superb
work of quality science‘ fiction.

I guarantee that if Star Trek was
still filmed live-action today,
“Yesteryear” would grab every
Emmy that Mister Spock could get
his Vulcan hands on. It is to be
read, reread, and cherished by
anyone who enjoyed the original
show’.

The third and ﬁnal script in Log

Log One is a healthy indication '1

women's doubles. Under the WTT
rule changes enacted last Sunday,
.women's doubles and men's
doubles- have been added to the
schedule, while the total number of
sets has been reduced from six to
ﬁve.

In Goolagong and Peggy Michel,
the Triangles have the Australian
and Canadian Opens doubles
champions. In the last six months,
the duo was only defeated once.
They equalled that total Tuesday,
losing to Karen Susman and Kathy

Michel was the NCAA doubles ~

unimportant when Battrick and
Rosewall copped the_ men's doubles
from Alexander and Geoff Masters

It was the Triangles third win

NEWPORT BEACH* Calif. AP -
The enthusiastic World Football
League has announced a 20-game
schedule for each of its 12 teams.
The slate, made public Tuesday,
starts with ﬁve games on Wednes-

nationally televised game July 11.
And they all count in the standings.

Portland is at Philadelphia,
Hawaii at Florida. Southern Calif-

this rough business. Otherwise I’d
like to see him get out of it and start
directing his energies in some
other direction.”

It is obvious that Futch and

Frazier have talked considerably,

about the advisability of Frazier
continuing as a ﬁghter.

Futch said Frazier came out of
the ﬁght with Ali in _“such great
physical shape, and is three and a
half weeks ahead of the training’
schedule he kep for the Ali ﬁght."

. Frazier, 30, lost to Ali January 28
in New York in his-ﬁrst ﬁghvsmce:
he lost the title to George Foreman
in January'l973.,

Futch said Frazier still has the
power that carried him to 30
victories--25 by knockout--in his 32
ﬁght career. He pictures Frazier in
the best mental and physical
condition since he was knocked out
by Foreman. . »

Frazier is conﬁdent he'll beat
Quarry and go on to a return title
bout with Foreman. He wants to
keep on ﬁghting.

“My next step is going back to

I the championship,” Frazier said-.

The $300,000 he'll probably earn
from ﬁghting Quarry is also a big
incentive, he admitted.

“In order to make all the
investments that I have to,‘it takes
money. Therefore I feel that this
ﬁght will help me to invest more.

Furthermore, I like ﬁghting. I feel X

I'm in good shape."

This will be the second meeting
between Frazier and Quarry.
Frazier won by a technical knockout
after the seventh round in-June,
1969, when he cut Quarry's right

. eye.-

took another ﬁrst with a 49. feet 9
1/2 inch triple jump, an event he
rarely even practiced during the
season. "

Rea’s triple jump competition
will be much tougher Saturday.
It’s led by Ed Lennex, a St.
Hoseplrﬂs sophomore form Pitts-
burgh’s Central Catholic High and
the East’s top triple jumper at 52
feet 5 inches. He’s also ranked
second in the high jump [7 feet]
and fourth in the long jump [24 feet
4 1/2 inches].

Maryland's Nick Basciano (9.3) '

heads the field in the 100-yard
dash, challenged by Seton Hall's
Alfred Daley‘ and Penn State's
Mike Sands. Daley (20.6) and
teammate Charles Joseph (20.9)
are the class of the 220, and, not
surprisingly, Seton Hall's mile
relay team is the favorite at a
blinding 3:08. .

PSU's Mike Shine, who copped
the Art Toner Memorial Award as
the Pitt Invitational's outstanding
performer, will return to defend his
Stadium records in the 120-yard
high hurdles (13.9) and 440-yard
intermediate hurdles (52.4).

Another Nittany Lion, John
Reihner, will try to repeat his
dazzling Invitational ‘performance‘--
he smashed the discus'record by
more than four feet with a fling of
170 feet 6% inches.

Tom Cummins of Dartmouth,
who has exceeded the 250 feet
mark, is among the top performers
in the javelin throw. _

Other Pitt hopes rest on Tim
Riley (6 feet 10 inches high jump),

Rich Martin (13:47 3-miles), and ,
. Rick Weaver (440).

The schedulelwill get underway
at 11:00 am both Friday and
Saturday. Friday’s program
includes the finals of five events
and qualifying rounds in 13 others.
Tickets for Friday will ‘cost $.50
for students and $1 for adults.

The remaining 15 ﬁnals will be
held Saturday, with tickets sold to
students for $1 and to adults for
$2.50. Parking will be available in
the Athletic Events Parking Lot
across from the Field House.

PHILADELPHIA AP--The Phil-
adelphia 76ers expect Billy Cun-
ningham to rejoin them for the
1974-75 National "Basketball As-
sociation season. But the Carolina
Cougars’ star says their announce-
ment “is just a lot of words."

“Cunningham is expected to
resume playing for the 76ers this
fall," the 76ers said in a statement
released Tuesday.

But the American Basketball
Association's Most Valuable Player
in the 1972-73 season, reached at

home in North Carolina said, “It

sounds more like anticipation than
a victory statement." _
Cunningham, who jumped from
the 76ers in 1972 and has fulfilled
two years of a three year contract
with the Cougars, said, “Nothing’s
been resolved at all between Mr.

Harness Racing At The Meadows

 

A Deviation From The‘Dull  

BY BART MACK
Sports. Editor
In an area where concentrated

"sports interests centers mainly on

the Black and Gold tradition on the
Steelers and Pirates, the Meadow-
lands stands out as a refreshing
change of pace. ~ '
If the rules and regulations that
are foundation and binding of
professional team sports become a
bit too rigid. a short trip down
Route 79 South is the remedy.

Harness racing, not at its best
but not by far at its worst. is the
Meadows‘ answer to’ the baseball-
football syndrome.’ And while not
displaying the quality of the New
York, Chicago, and Philadelphia

- tracks, the Meadows still boasts a

solid A12 year reputation that puts it
right behind them.

“We've never had any sort of
scandal in our 12 years,” says Neil
Karp, the 1973 winningest .[per-

centage-wise] driver in the United
States. “Theie were 16 drivers
held in a racing scandal in New
York last winter, but down here we
have a-elean track.”

The harness term “driver"
differs‘ greatly from the “jockey"
who mounts the thoroughbreds,
and Karp, 5 feet 11 inches tall and
165 pounds is quite the opposite of
his counterparts.

“We have some drivers here that
weigh in over 200 pounds," Karp
said, “but then again it's a
different type of racing."

At the Meadows, all races are
one mile even and usually run‘ in
slightly over two minutes. But the
great difference between the two
types of racing is quite evident. A

“In harness racing, all the action
takes place in the final stretch
turn." Karp said. “With the size
of the sulky and the number of
them in the race, it's easy to get
boxed in once you’re‘out of the
gate. There's just no room to
safely maneuver until that ﬁnal
turn."

When they all come around in
the stretch, whips ﬂicking over
each horse's back, often it's six
across. The racingis still the same;
the early ﬁght for the inside
position before the turn and‘the
wild scramble down the stretch.
But the mere appearance of the
sulky and driver give the sport that
certain ﬂair. \

The sulky itself is barely more
than a metal frame, so light a touch
of the hand can send it spinning.‘
The varied weight of the drivers’,
ranging anywhere from 100 to 190

The Meadows’ racing surface is
