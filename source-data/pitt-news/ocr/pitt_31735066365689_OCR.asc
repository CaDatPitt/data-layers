A recent survey of job pros-
pects for college graduates indi-
cates that employers will hire
more, but not many more. college
graduates this year.

Taken by the College Placement
Council of Bethlehem. Pa.. the
survey shows that among its 835
responding employing organiza-

' tions, an across-the-board five per
cent increase in hiring is antici-
pated this year.

If this expectation is realized, it
will represent the first increase in
the number of college grads hired
in three years.

The 835 employers interviewed

 

O   pro  6

  u~“‘-1 '

       

college grads this year, compared
to’ 54,870 hired last year.

A Council spokesman. however.
cautioned college grads against
becoming too hopeful.

"All of this is relative." the
spokesman said. "These figures
are compared with those of last

year. when the level of college re- .

cruiting was the lowest in many

years. Even with the increases,‘

the number of anticipated hires
is still considerably below the
peak figures of the late ‘60s."

The slight increase will not be
reflected in the level of recruit-
ment on campus. The 835 indi-

cated that they plan I3 per cent
fewer visits to campuses this
~ year.

Jean Kessler. Council adminis-
trative co-ordinator, offered three
reasons for the decline in on-cam-
pus interviews:, (1) higher accep-
tance rates. cutting down on the
need to interview as many candi-
dates; (2) a large number of ap-
plications and "walk-ins" (can-
didates who go directly to the per-
sonnel offices), and (3) referrals
from other sources, such as re-
turning servicemen.

Although the study itself was an
overview and did not break down
the information beyond general

tsamw slight iupturn  

_estimated they will hire 57,500

categories, Council officials pre-
dict that technical fields will show
the biggest gains, while prospects
for liberal arts will be gloomier
than ever.

Although no dramatic improve-
ment in the employment. pros-
pects of college graduates is fore-
cast for the next year, the survey
does provide the first optimistic
note in some time.

"It was just a matter of how
long we were going to go in the
other direction," said Kessler.
"Hopefully if the economic situa-
tion keeps improving, there will
be even more opportunities in the
near future.“

University   “7aI,(1S  Denenberg challenges PIRG

flu’s powerful grip(pe) II9althT9f07‘"”l-3 U7 A

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

Though County residents are
sniffling and hacking under a rec-
ord-breaking attack of the Hong
Kong flu, its grip on the Universi-
ty has been considerably milder‘.

Thus far, Allegheny County has
recorded 7,732 cases of the dis-
ease, compared to 4,428 cases
during the -last wave of the flu in

 1968-69. '

A nurse at the Student Health ’

Service, which does not keep stat-
istics on the sickness, said that
though incidence of the flu “seems,
to have increased a great deal
over previous years,” it is far
from reaching epidemic propor-
tions-.

She added that the Health Serv- -

ice has no sure-fire remedy for
‘-1 ya the flu.

"It's the type of thing like a

cold,“ she said, "that nothing_

helps it but rest. fluids, aspirin,
and symptomatic treatment."

Hardest hit at the University
seems to have been the Athletic
Department.

Cagers Carl Morris, Cleve Ed-
wards, and Billy Knight were
slowed by the bug, and members
of the track and wrestling teams
also lostzbouts to the flu.

"I wouldn't say it’s had a dev-
astating effect," cautioned Sports
Information Director Dean Bill-
lick. "because most of the ath-
letes have played through it pret-
7  ‘-‘ty well." '

 

 “It has to have hampered us
somewhat,” he conceded, “but it
seems to be affecting everyone.”

Including. said Billick. the op-
position.

The flu was responsible for late
and cold meals in the Towers
Cafeteria .\/Ionday night when. ac-

, cording to Szabo Food Service As-
sistant Manager Bert Provoznik.

L about a dozen employees were out

(7 with the flu.

; . To ease the manpower short-
age, Szabo was forced to pull in
managerial personnel behind the

, lines and even into the kitchens.

Though meals were delayed, Pro-
, voznik said he received a number
 : , of compliments on the neophyte
~:,_ if chefs.

 A The Book Center was also forced
 tocall out its -irregulars to battle

   

 

.‘~

the bug.

"We‘ve had a good many off,"
related Book Center Manager
Mary Banach. “But fortunately
we have a part-time pool of peo-
ple whom we call at peak times
that we’ve been drawing from.“

Flu_ prevented Pa. Attorney Gen-
eral J. Shane Creamer from at-
tending a Public Interest Re-
search Group Seminar here Wed-
nesday.

But aside from these few areas.
the University has largely es-
caped the woes of the flu. 4

The Steno Pool reports only a
slight increase in requests for its
services. The Registrar's Office,
which employs about 60, has suf-
fered only two or three cases of
flu. '

A Housing secretary said that
that department's casualties had
been restricted to “one girl out
and one just coming back.” .

"I can feel it coming on." she
said, "but that’s about all.“

”At News and Publications. Di-
rector Joe Colangelo missed a
week because of the flu. but only a
few of.Colangelo's staff played
follow the leader. '

It would seem logical to expect

that students of the School of Den-

tal Medicine, because of their
“hand-to-mouth” existence, would
be natural prey for the flu. Assis-
tant Dean D11: Thomas Barker
said, however, that the flu’s ef-
fects on the Dent School had been
minimal.

One department where the flu
has made no inroads is Political
Science, which department chair-
man Dr. William Keefe attributes
to the stern constitutions of his
colleagues.

"By and large." Keefe said.
"political scientists are imper-
vious to any disease."

Dr. Marina Whitman of the Eco-
nomics Department has been ap-
pointed a member of President
Nixon's Council of Economics Ad-
visers.

Dr. Whitman is the first woman
to be named to the Council.

An interview of Dr. Whitman will
appear in Wednesday's Pitt News.

Vance companies to pay more ade-

Insurance Commissioner Her-
bert S. Denenberg challenged the
Western Pennsylvania Public In-
terest Research Group to go to
work on a broad range of consum-
er issues confronting the Pennsyl-
vania Insurance Department.

Denenberg was among the
speakers who addressed the PIRG
Symposium on "Student Activism
for the Public Interest" at Pitt
Thursday. '

Methods of compelling insur-

quate policyholder dividends and
ways of regulating and improving
/mail order advertising of health
insurance are among the areas on
which Denenberg said the Insur-
ance Department is working.

Also important, according to Denen-

berg, is providing all‘Pennsylvanians with,

automatic protection in their insurance po-

licies against .man-made and natural dis-'

asters such as flood, earthquake, radio-ac-
tive contamination;’and mine cave-in.

“What we need more than -anything "A

else.” he said, "is new ideas. We rarely
get them from the insurance industry. We
come up with them ourselves or do with-
out. We could use some -help.” 

"We need research and ‘proposals. We
need precisely what your PIRG can pro-
vide." ‘ -

Denenberg claimed that the Insurance
Department deals with the critical con-
sumer issues of health care and health in-
surance, auto insurance and compensation,
and consumer control of corporate enter-
prise such as mutual companies.

"If your group can provide us with sound
proposals in our area of responsibility,” he
promised, "we will implement them.“

Ernest Sternglass, Pitt professor and _

atomic energy expert. talked about the
problem of radiation which he called “the
clean pollution that kills silently.”

The technology we’ve created, accord-
ing to Sternglass, has turned upon us and
threatened to destroy us.

“It makes us as inadequate to survive
as the dinasour,” he said. “It is the price
paid for delusion.“

Sternglassforzesees PIRG‘s acting as a
counter-force to military and special inter-
est groups to end the present imbalance.

David Nixon, professor of political sci-
ence at Penn State, pointed out that citi-
zens without much background can influ-
ence the vigor with which a law is enforced.

Nixon, a successful litigant under the

1899 Refuse Act which states that there is.

‘I

no dumping in navigable waters without a
permit from the armed forces, stated that
he wants “law and order to apply to every-
body, especially large corporations.“

He said that PIRG can be most effective

a asa catalyst. ,
“The secret,” he said, -“is keeping the"

pressure on and embarrassing these agen-
cies.”

Donald Ross, one of the team of Ralph’

Nader‘s lawyers that organized’ PIRG

V chapters all over the country, said he hopes -

the group will defeat the “You can't fight
City Hall” attitude.

Ross said the group" to should protect
workers in large corporations who.don‘t
protest poor conditions for fear of losing
their jobs if they speak up.

Rick Lanis spoke for the Alliance for
Consumer Protection which is concern-
ed with fighting deceptive trade practices
and fraud. He admitted that although his
organization can apply intense pressure to
individual offenders, a grouplike PIRG
could wield enormous influence.

Bod Adler, head of the Pennsylvania
Consumer Protection Bureau, and Donna
Deaner, director of the Allegheny Consum-
er Protection Bureau talked about the
problems confronting ‘the new-born and

poorly-funded consumer protection agen-

cies. V ~

Fear that a hostile student gov-

4 ernment may someday abolish the

Health Service Organization has

i‘  caused members of the group to

seek independence of its parent.

Because the Health Service Or-
ganization (HSO) is a subcommit-

' tee of Student Government, it can

be terminated at the discretion of

fice.

Although the members of the
HSO, which ad-

on medical prob-
lems, have no
fear of being
ousted by new-
ly-elected Pres-
dent Tom Bailey
and his Board,

chairman of the '
committee, said <?:‘i‘
they do fear fu-
ture govern-
ment change-

overs.

“We can be
abolished at any
time,” he said.
“If new people
say, ‘we don’t like the Health

we’re abolished.”

Student Government leaders
alsohave final say over the com-
mittee’s structure and leader-
ship. Therefore, Hiller said a spe-
cific ‘program of the committee,

‘such as Abortion Referral, might

be jeopardized some day by a
President or Board opposed to it.

According to Hiller, the HSO
has two additional reasons for
seeking independence: 1) it could
function more effectively without
the strings that attach it to Stu-
dent Government, and 2) it». could

prohibited the HSO from keeping
strict confidentialityof its deal-

explained that he had to make
monthly reports this past year to
Committees Commissioner Wade
Lawson as to the use of monies
from the Medical Loan Fund.

The philosophy of the people in
the HSO, Hiller said, is "to help
anyone and anybody,” but as a
part of Student Government they
were only permitted to aid under-
graduate students.

"I was told by
Wade Lawson,
that since grad-
uate students do

Tom Bailey said that he and the

decision to try for independence
from their group and had found no
objections to it.

However. he warned that HSO
may encounter some difficulties
with the Administration over
funding of the Medical Loan Fund.

prefer that a member of Student
Government remain responsible
for allocations of the monies. ‘

Possible delegate candidates

Senator George McGovern were nominated in each
of Allegheny County’s seven senatorial districts

Monday night.

Among those nominated were seven Pitt stu-
dents and one Pitt professor. They are Ron Brown.
Norma Chase, Lud Hanczar. Harris Miller. Marc
Hiller. Lon Howell, Susie McDevitt. and Associate

Professor Theodore Windt.

These eight persons will have their names and
resumes sent to Senator McGovern for final selec-
tion of delegates. His choices will be based on the
new reform guidelines which demand that delega-
tions be representative of the groups in their states.

The persons selected by McGovern will run in
, Pennsylvania‘s April primary.

Ron Brown, the newly elected president of the
Young Democrats and one of the Pitt students who
was nominated, has. this to say about the conven-
tion held Monday night: "I was impressed with the
turnout. The convention went beyond the guidelines
of the reform commission in being an open demo-

cratic process.”

L Lud Hanczar, a sophomore, stressed the im-
portance of the youth vote in this campaign. He said,
“Many politicians are anxious to use the youth .vote,
but are not receptive to the idea of young people

having any power.

In speaking of the effect of the delegate re-
forms. Hanczar noted. "The McGovern reforms
have made the delegates to the Democratic Conven-
tion more representative of the party member-
ship. I think it will force the action at the Convention

inside instead of outside as in ’68.”

Student Government Board
member Terri Weaver would like
to see "greater student participa-
tion, with morecommittees open».
to the students.”

Noting that the new SG admin-
istration is currently in the organ-
izational stage, she added that
"right now we’re working on set-
ting up the committees.“

In this area, Weaver said she
would "like to increase opportun-
ities for student involvement," as
opposed to virtual SG decision-
making "dictatorship.”

While one of Weaver’s prime‘
concerns remains the Student
Health Service, she stated that at

present the Board must complete

the new constitution.

Delegate selection starts

by DEBRA DUNCAN

Also nominated to be recommended as a dele-
committed to , _ ,
co-ordinator for McGovern in Western Pennsyl-
vania. He commented on the response for McGov-
ern: "I think this shows that. contrary to the polls,
there is a group of intensely active people dedicated
to George McGovern. It is seen in the recent results
of the Iowa precinct caucuses. I think both the situa-
tions in Iowa and here in Pittsburgh show that ev-
eryone has the opportunity to make some input into
the system." ‘

These “mini-conventions” held Monday night
were the first step in the reforms which have been
adopted to revamp the delegate selection to the
Democratic Convention. Following the Convention
in Chicago in 1968 Senator McGovern headed a
committee known as the McGovern Commission for
Delegate Selection and Party Reform. This body
has made recommendations which have been adopt-
ed by 45 of the nation’s states.

Basically, the reforms call for selection of del-
egates proportional to the number of women, young
and minority groups found in the state. Such a se-

which took place at the 1968 convention.

Under the new reforms, 75 per cent of the dele-
gates must be selected by direct vote in the April
primary.,When those have been chosen, 15 per cent
more will be chosen by them. and-the remaining 10
per -cent will be selected by the Democratic State
Committee. I

1 Following these reforms McGovern had pro'-
posed these guidelines for the Monday night con-
vention: 40 per cent women, 15 per cent under 30

orities.

VVeaVer seeks student interest

Another aim, according to Weav-
er, would be increased coverage
of such activities in the Pitt News.
She explained, “So many groups
depend on it for exposure.”

"The by-laws still have to be
written,” she pointed out.

Weaver remarked that the C
Board hopes “to get more com-
munity projects started, and also

draw more attention to student Weaver Said that She does

not-approve of SG salaries.

"I really think that-if you ran,
you wanted to—and you should get
out of it the satisfaction that
you’re serving,” she said.

‘u Personally, I think it’s ri-
diculous,” she contended.

Commenting on the functioning
of the Board, Weaver said, "I
think we’re working well together
as a group."

"We’re all fresh and all new,”'
she contended, "and not influ-
enced by any previous affiliation.”

Weaver is confident that the
Board will operate successfully.
“We have bright ideas,“ she con-
cluded.

Housing cutsibackﬂ  .   S _       I 
Disunity hampers pollution battle

ranks for all Term.

by RON LOZOWSKI
Feature Editor

The Housing Office recently announced a cutback in the hiring of
Resident Assistants (RA‘s) for the fall term.

John Vrana, director of Housing, said that the reduction would pro-
vide for "a slight degree of consistency” regarding the number of stu-
dents each RA must relate to.

Vrana explained that in the past, some RA’s have had to cope with
as many as 62 students, while others worked with as few as 27.

The hoped-for figure falls somewhere in the range ofi50‘-5.5 students
under each RA, Vrana stated. .

Another change in RA procedures involves the payment of a stip-
end to RA’s and unit leaders. RA’s will receive a $100 per term, while
unit leaders will be paid $400 per term. In addition, both positions are
further compensated with free room and board.

At present, the majority of RAS obtain only free room and board.
Senior RA’s receive an additional $100 per term.

According to Vrana, the stipend is being offered due to the addi-
tional duties that will be incurred by the lesser number of RA’s.

The paring of RA ranks—will result in the abolition of about one-
third of the number of posts filled at the present time.

In most other respects, the basic responsibilities of the position
will remain unchanged. However, with the creation of the unit leader
post, the existing position of Senior RA will be abolished.

RA applications will be available inthe Housing Office tomorrow.
The deadline for filing the forms is Feb. 10.

featured during the final day of
the Public Interest Research
Groups Symposium here.

Louik, a public interest lawyer,
his experiences while working
with the force on‘ air pollution
cases in the Saxonburg and Clair-
ton areas.

He said that.the fight had been
hampered by the lack of specific
organization among the people in
these areas against the polluter,
United States Steel. Though the
Saxonburg farmers had complain-
ed separately, Louik said, the
Clairton millworkers had been
afraid to speak out against their
employer.

I

. Saxonburg’s problems have been
brought to court and are being
solved, but Clairton’s problems
are just in the challenge stage. A
hill behind the U.S. Steel coke-
plant there, said Louik, has borne
the brunt of the pollutants.

A 14-year-old in my neighborhood hung

told her parents she didn’t feel like com-

If that ninth-grader had known a little
bit more about how to solve her problems.
-perhaps she would have stuck to the,“real
life” route a little longer.

When a person is a little older, and pre-
sumed to be more mature, the options are
more in number than those of a child. But
some of the options remain the same, as in
suicide.

By the time a person reaches college

‘ level problems, the stakes for overcoming

them reach mind shattering proportions.
“What if I find out I don’tlike my ma-

_ jor after ‘three years? What"'would I do
then?" Job market permeability_is also a '

question that won't alleviate a cold grey
feeling a term before graduation.

Some of the so-called simpler problems
of college people are those resulting from
dormitory living. The day-to-day annoy-
ances of spiteful roommates, caroiising
neighbors, and incomprehensible personal-
ity conflicts are tough to solve .

The Catholic Church might brand these
hassles as “crosses to bear” for which a
reward in heaven will await those who car-
ry the load nobly. The personal need for ‘a
quick cure transcends the extra jewel you
might get in your ethereal crown, how-
ever.

sonal problems, have geared their roles
around student needs.

The Counseling Center, 205 SU. serves

nearly a third of the University population
each year with problem-solving ideas, ca-
reer information, and academic and non-
academic advice.

Most students fear the stigma of the
word‘ “counseling.’.’ “Who needs a shrink?
All I need is some money, a new girlfriend
a different major, and someone to talk ra-
tionally with.”

Dr. Gallagher.-director of the center.
says that members of the University com-
munity are welcome and invited to share
their thoughts with someone who might be
able to helpthem. Even homesickness. a
private burden, with some side effects.
doesn‘t have to go untended.

A Little Help from Your Friends. neigh-
bors residing in the small building besides
McCormick Hall, share the same ideas
about confidentiality as do the Counseling
Center people.

Students and non-students are welcome
to call andtalk, ask questions, or seek in-
formation on nearly any subject. Recently,
I personally,called -Friends to ask aboutva
few pills a ‘person had consumed. Their
ready’ information and advice saved his
life. A little dramatic? Yes, but he lived.

Resident Assistants, too, are built into
the dorm. system primarily as a service for
students. Floor occupants may often pass
up talking with an ‘RA just to keep a prob-
lem private. Housing Office policy also dic-
tates confidentiality.

Personality maintenance is a more im-
portant item for ‘an RA’s time than light
bulb maintenance and students should rec-
ognize this.

There are many other places where an-
swers to problems seem to materialize.
These three, were just a sample, but
hardly to be passed aside carelessly.

 Editor : I

The other day the University

1 was approached by a spokesman

from one of the major television

1 networks about filming a situa-
;tion comedy based on life here at

the University.

' ‘ 5 It seems the network in ques-
. tion is having trouble playing the

‘rating game against “All in the
Family,” television's new number

A .i one program.

i Their answer is to film a week-
ly comedy series based on the con-
tinuing exploits of our student
government.

 

   
  

The new weekly serial may be
entitled “All in the University.“
Its format would include shout-
ing matches at student govern-
ment meetings, unauthorized
spending of the student's money,
secret negotiations at secret
meetings, and elected officers
voting themselves salaries.

I for one hope the new comedy
series fails.

In my three years at the Uni-
versity, I’ve seen enough student
government comedy acts to hold
me over for a few years -to come.

There are a fewpromising signs

pointing towards a reversalof stu-

1) the voting turnoutjthis year

2) the reputations of thelnewly
elected officers are all clean;

3) there remains no reason for

continued friction with the Pitt
News.

Then, again, there may be, a"

few negative signs apparent. ‘Cri-
tics have pointed out that the new
student ‘government lacks experi-
ence. ,

I’m not certain experience is
the most important criterion ne-

cessary for running a student

government in which the most
.serious problem faced is apathy.
Experience breeds competence
but even the most competent ad-
ministrator cannot intiate pro-
grams without an enthusiastic
backing. _

Enthusiasm and’ limited experi-
ence are what the new student
government brings to office.

I personally have never seen a
more enthusiastic candidate run
for any office than Tom Bailey.

This enthusiasm may prove the
spark needed for involving our

pseudo-sophisticated upperclass—

men in school activities.

Nixon’s policies
dishearten Democrats,
youths, blacks

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Democrats wasted no time in launching‘ a full-scale attack on
President Nixon’s State of the Union message. Immediately they coun-
tered with an extensive list of what they considered neglected issues.
Many of their arguments» were meritorious.

One of several missiles fired ca’me from Rep. Martha Griffiths of
Michigan who pointed to the inadequacy of Nixon’s health proposals.
According to the Congresswoman, what is needed is “total national
health insurance."

Rep. John Melcher of Montana blasted the Chief Executive for ig-
noring "rural America and the forgotten farmer,” and insisted that
farmers get fair prices for their output. '

Illinois‘Representative Ralph Metcalfe maintained that the Ad-

ministration “has no coherent set of priorities for dealing with the
problems of American cities” and has been unresponsive to the needs

' of urban minorities.
Legitimate as these matters may be, what puts Mr. Nixon at an .

advantage is the public‘s indifference to these issues. either because

people feel-too detached from the problems, or there is insufficient cov-,

 

erage by the news media in these areas

  

These issues are furthermore overshadowed by three major ones,
two involving foreign affairs. Vietnam, regarded by many as the most
critical problem, is one of them. Nixon has said that it will not be an
issue in this campaign, and his efforts to bring home the troops com-
bined with his recent peace gestures no doubt leave a favorable im-

pression in the minds of many Americans. ‘ .

, Many voters are also encouraged by the President’s plans to visit ‘
Peking and Moscow and probably believe this could lead to better rela-

tions with the two countries‘. -
The third major issue is of a domestic character and concerns the

. _ v :r::_s;:.-‘-i

economy. Many Americans are satisfied, for they appreciate that Nix- ~

on is taking some form of action, even though they may not understand
the implications. . '

Nixon’s prestigious position may also be advantageous for him, as
his word to the voters may appear more credible as a result. Senator
William Proxmire of Wisconsin remarked that the President is doing
nothing to curb the unemployment problem. However," in his address,
Nixon ‘promised ‘‘full employment in peace time.” ’

‘Despite Mr. Nixon’s advantages, other factors may hurt him, for’/ -

his popularity among various minority groups is not great. One of the
largest and most significant minorities consists of the 18-to-2l-year-

old voters, many of them already disillusioned with his Vietnam strate- .

gy. A good proportion of these people are also ‘finding his guarantee of
more jobs a false promise, especially college seniors who will receive
their diplomas in spring. A . - .

Ernest Holmok, placement director at Pitt, recently told the

Pittsburgh Press that the job outlook for graduating seniors is still
bleak. '

President Nixon also stands at odds with the Black community for
his lack of commitment to help improve the livingconditions of its
members. Many of them are further disenchanted by his attitudes
against busing, which suggest that his opposition to de facto segregation

' is superficial.

Farmers might represent still another discouraged faction, and
they, too, could prove influential in November.

Whatever criticism opponents raise, words alone will not defeat
Mr. Nixon. Of course, the candidate the Democrats nominate at their
convention will make a difference, but the main determinant in
whether or not the President is reelected is if these disgruntled min-
orities can successfully coalesce. I ~

Ideas &: Figures clinic

  draws area students

by MARY WELTY
A poetry reading by Louise Gluck, writer in residence at God-

dard College. highlighted the annual Ideas and Figures high school —

poetry and prose clinic Saturday. A native of New England, Gluck
read several selections from her 1968 anthology and some of her
most recent works.

Every year the clinic draws interested students and faculty from
the surrounding tri—state area. Many come from as far away as Cleve-
land E0 heal“ the keynote speaker and participate in seminars and
workshops.

In previous years the Ideas and Figures staff has conducted a

‘poetry and prose contest in conjunction with the clinic. This year.

however, the staff dropped the contest and found a better turnout
of students interested in talking about their writing rather than hav-
ing it judged as good or bad.

The seminars offered this year included: primitive’ and 'avant-
garde music ‘with Victor Grauer; literature of the South with George
Deepe; writing the shortstory with Myron Taube; playwriting
and drama .criticism with Charles Levine and Richard Kalinoski;
despair in literature with John Heyda, the experimental film with
David Saz, and Poetics with Louise Gluck. ‘

After a banquet in‘ the Student Union, workshops on poetry
and prose were held. The students received constructive criticism by
seminar leaders and Ideas and Figures staff members. a

The most important result of the University’s
Woman’s Choral Concert this past Saturday with

‘ Capital University’s-Men’s Glee Club’ was that the
- women proved that they have improved signifi-

cantly’ over the past few years.
Whether the success is totally attributable to

. ‘ ‘ the woman is debatable. ‘It was apparent that even-
‘ ing that the group’s director, Phil Cavanaugh, is
, at the helm of their success. (Cavanaugh is also
» director of the University’s Men’s Glee Club).

A good director must not only beversatile mu-

' -sically, but he must also develop a strong rapport,
"one of respect, between himself and the group.

Cavanaugh, ob-viously has cultivated these qualities._

The group opened with Verdi's Laudi Alla
Vergine Maria, followed by Gillaume Dufay’s
15th century 0 Sehastiane, accompanied by cello
and recorder.

Though the recorder and cello combination
provided a warm, mellow blending, the musician
at the recorder seemed to be having problems with
breath control. This,’ however, is understandable,

since he was a “stand-in” musician, and had little‘
time to become familiar with the music.

Gypsy Songs, seven short melodies by Anton
Dvorak, not only was the number that best show-

ed offthe abilities of the singers, but also point-

ed out accompanist Linda Stanley as the best of
the evening’s concert. Although a bit raced, the
tunes did not noticeably suffer.

_The severest criticism which can be leveled

.would be that their share of the program was far

too minimal, and should have included a light,
popular number or two.

Showmanship, stage. presence, and ‘familiarity

' ’ with the numbers they did‘ perform was at a high

point for the Choral.

* * * * * * * * * *

The purpose of such concerts is to mix a men’s
glee club and a woman’s choral musically, and
socially. ‘

Capital. not only toted along aﬁhalf-dozen of

f A Page 6—THE PITT NEWS—Monday, January 31, 1972

their own women, but attempted to dominate the pro-
gram. Their pomposity A. was so overdone that it
was humorous at times.

. The group rendered 11 members .1 . . . and
even gave two encores that’ weren't demanded by
the audience..All this before the-women could do’
one! ‘ '

, Apparently Capital has an overly high regard
for itself. They were not even graciousenough to in-
form the Pitt women of their intended numbers so
proper programs could be printed. Instead, they
brought their own, which the woman had to insert
into their own programs. ‘

Those programs were a work in themselves,
including every number in the Glee .Club’s reper-
toire, and a pitch to join CapitalUniversity.

My Bonnie Lass She Smelleth: by P.D.Q.
Bach, a take-off on an old, traditional number,
was one of their better numbers, combining diffi-
cult vocal technique with humor. This, howevei,
was not done by the glee club proper, but rather
by their Chamber singers, comprised of seven of the
men and the six women they brought along.

Psalm I was set to music by James Davis, an
ex-member of the College now serving in the Army.
Although the vocal score seemed adequate, the pi-
ano part was awkward, and often distracting.

They generally did better sticking to ‘lighter
numbers, the hillbilly Mountain Dew done as an
encore, and Shall I Marry, a Hungarian folk song
offered by the club’s Varsity Quartet. ‘ ’ .

The club attempted He Ain’t Heavy, He’s
My Brother by Bob Russell and Bobby Scott, un-
fortunately. .Beautiful, well-harmonized, but it
dragged and lacked the power necessary for making
this tune ‘come across successfully.

__ Considering Capital has a Music Conservatory,
as they tell us in the program, one would have ex-
pected more of them. Comparing them to colleges
without such benefits, they come across.as aver-
age. ~
Let us hope that when our women go to C01-
umbus, the good taste inherent in Pitt musical
groups will follow, a little rubbing off on the Capi-
tal director’s sleeves. ' ‘ A

Tribute paid Proust

by ANDREW J. SOPKO

A belated centennial celebration of the birth of Marcel Proust oc-
curred this past week as the music department honored the French nov-
elist in an evening dedicated to "Music in Paris at the Time of Proust.”

After ge‘tting’past such an ostentatious title as this, one finds it
necessary to reflect for a moment upon just what type of effect Proust
had upon music (and vice versa). After reading the program notes and
thumbing through a recent book of essays in honor of the author, one
comes to the conclusion that his influence on. such composers as De-
bussy and Franck was practically nonexistent.

To Proust, just as to many other Parisians, music was nothing
more than apres dinner entertainment for the salon.

As such, it was quite proper that the program beginwith “after-
dinner music” of apsort, The Variations on a Theme of Mozart by Hahn,
a piece so worn and outdated that its artistic quality is certainly to be
Bernard Goldberg an-
nounced that “this work was dedicated to my teacher’s teacher.” Does
he think that such pretentious announcements as this will authenticate

. his interpretations in the eyes of the audience? We certainly hope not.

Luckilyfor us, things became more serious as Chaimian Gadd,
violin, and Patricia Parr, piano, both of Duquesne University, gave a
very professional reading of the A major Sonata of Cesar-Franck. Al-
though Gadd’s fingerings were not always precise and her bowing not

always clean, a competent interpretation was nevertheless conveyed,

The canonic portions of the last movement were especially well done
by both artists. T

Three short songs of Debussy based upon poems of Mallarme fol-
lowed. Sung by Mary Ann Doody with Marvin Tartak at the keyboard,
the only thing mentionable about these works is their brevity. Doody,
a generally good soprano, was in very fine voice, thus making us wish
thlat vocal selections of more substance that this would have been
c osen.

Gabriel Faure’s C minor Piano Quartet concluded the program as
Murray Feldman, violin; Samuel Elkind, viola; Alginates Motiekaites,
cello. and Marvin Tartak, piano, proved their musicianship as they
worked together to form a well-disciplined musical group. The pizi-
catti were clean and the bowing was smooth, thus contributing to a gen-
erally satisfactory performance. * v

__ Although none. of the works on the program could be considered
first-rate masterpieces of the repertoire, they conveyed the spirit of
musical Paris at the turn of the century. And since that is the case,
one imagines that they conveyed the atmosphere that molded Proust
as we 1.

Crowd gives ovation

Soviet pI'0g1'a111' joyful

by ANDREW J. SOPKO

Cultural exchanges between the Soviet Union.‘ and" the United
States have become commonplace in recent years, and the American

hunger for "Russkaya Cultura” in such exchanges was evident this

visit to Pittsburgh. ’

Augmented with stars of the Bolshoi Opera and Ballet, a color-
.ful program of Russian folk and classical music attracted a capa-
city audience to Heinz Hall. '

The orchestra consists of folk instruments of six sizes (the bala-
laika is somewhat comparable to the mandolin), psaltery, ancient
horns, pipes, and accordions. When one puts all these components
together in addition, to musical precision, the result is a brilliant mu-
sical sound, bound toplease anyone.

Since the printed program was‘ hardly followed, it was quite a
chore to figure out what was going on, especially when program
numbers ‘were dropped in favor of encores. Folk songs made up the
greater portion of the program. - . '

In the first part, soprano Tamara Sorokina of the Bolshoi Opera,
captivated the audience with her rendition of Over the Fields. One of
the evening’s big surprises came when she answered the audience’s
wild enthusiasm with the encore “Summertime” from Porgy and
Bess. ‘

During the first part of the program, the artists appeared in tra-
ditional folk costumes; following «intermission, however, they chang-
ed to more usual concert-hall attire. Following the change, folk
singer Ludmilla Zupina appeared with a selection of songs that dis-
played her rich contralto voice. ‘

Leaps and bounds appeared not only in the music but on the
stage as well, as the husband-wife team Yulia and Stanislav Vlasov‘
then appeared in a choreographic duet. After seeing dancers like
these, one knows why Russian ballet holds the world-wide reputa-
tion that it does.

Orchestral fireworks closed the program as the entire ensemble
launched‘into -Khatchaturian_’s Sabre" Dance. At its conclusion, a
standing ovation brought an orchestral reply with the folksong Kat-
usha. A spirited audience clapped in rhythm until the orchestra had
finished. At that point, in the traditional Russian Manner, the or-
chestra applauded the audience.

It was certainly a refreshing experience to attend a concert at
Heinz Hall where it was evident that the entire audience had actu-

ally enjoyed itself and had shown it. Such occasions as this are very ’

rare indeed, but when they occur, they are a joy to behold.

 

  
     
    
  
   
 
 
  
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
   
 
  
  
   
   
   
  
  
     

  

‘Pitt News Drama Critic

Two young and gifted directors presented one

,of Shaw’s lesser works, and one of Albee’s most en-

during for the most recent production of Pitt’s Stu-
dio Theatre.

George Bernard Shaw's Poison, Passion, and Pet-. A»

, , .  , _rifactiqn,, directed by;J eff Boudov, was the first of a
past week when the.Osipov Balalaika Orchestra of Moscow paid ‘a '  " ' ‘ '

double 'bill,.,_fQ;llowed by Dennis Grossman direct-
ing Edward Albee’s The American Dream.

POISON

Poison is an overdone melodrama that is hum-
orous in spite of ltsstupidity and most often be-
cause of it. It isn't quite as good asan old cartoon,
because most old cartoons I’ve seen have had more
substance than this particular farce. Except for
the bright and energetic performance of Carol
Gnatuk (Magnesia), those who accompany her

are. for the most part, much less satisfying ‘in '

their portrayals. '' g_
While Gnatuk remains, fresh and bright

throughout theevening, giving her character ev- —

er_y advantage, Edwin Rupert (Fitz), and Kenneth
Neal (Adolphus) in major roles, were both slow
to get moving.

While Rupert comes off rather well from mid-
dle to end, Neal remaines overdrawn_and some-
what clumsy in every direction throughout the
show. In short Neal is a bit too much! .

Randy. Abelman (Phyllis) draws raves for her
delightful portrayal of Magnesia’s maid as does
Ron Sopyla for his performance as the doctor.
Sopyla, however, tends to perpetuate the same
type of characterization from role to role. Most
shows in which I have criticized this before,
because it was the play fitting Sopyla, rather
than the reverse. In this case, however, his stand-
ard method is quite appropriate and in fact one
of the brighter moments of the show. A '

Other contributors are Debbie Unger (Land-
lady) and Jack Tierney (Policeman) both of whom
areineither significant nor at the same time com-

A superb cast is headed by Mimi Skoog. As.

sitive portrayal I‘ve seen at the Studio all season.

Special praise goes to Mary Jacobs-Ford (Mommy) 4-T‘;
and Barry Klassel (Daddy) for their energetic 

and ‘vivacious performances in major roles.

Claire Mikowski (Mrs. Barker) and Norm John-_
son (Young Man) were both significant and join
the others in a well-deserved curtain call.

Sets by Dick Knowles, light design by Doug

Coates are deserving of praise.

The Studio“ Theatre has given us _'two new,

talented directors and a few bright stars fortheir .

first production of 1972. Let‘s hope we see more
of them in the future.

Sports Editor

The Penn State Nittany Lions
had something to prove Saturday
night at the Field House and
they did it at the expense of the
Pitt Panthers, -saddling the Cats
with their eighth loss in 16 starts,
74-62.

The Lions. now 9-6 on the sea-
son, have posted a less than re-
spectable 4-6 record on the road.
The myth has risen for several
seasons that Penn State can’t
win on the road and according
to Cage Coach John Bach, “they
were just sick and tired of get-

ting sympathy. They made up_

their minds that they were go-
_ing to win and they did."

Playing their tenth game'on
the road in their first fifteen
the Lions found the range from
all over the court. With senior
guard Chuck Crist bombing from
outside and sophomore sensation
Ron Brown driving the lane,

Penn State couldn’t do anything :-

wrong. The Lions‘ 56.9 field goal
percentage can -attest. to that
fact.

“It all fell into place tonight,”
continued Bach. “I thought we
attacked. I thought we went in-
to them tonight. I just feel that
for the last month we’ve been
playing this well on the road.
We played a more aggressive,
forceful game.”

At the other end of the court
the Panthers couldn’t do any-
thing right. With no com-
plaints about the officiating,
everything fell Pitt’s way ex-
cept the scoring. Outrebound-
ing the Lions 47-32, while tak-
ing 27 more shots (78-51), the
Cats just couldn’t put the ball
in the bucket.

Billy Knight turned in an-
other one of his standard top-
notch performances, canning ten
of 20 from the field and two of
four from the foul stripe (22
pts.)' in addition to his 13 re-
bounds. Kent Scott (12) was the
only other Panther who reached

double figures. " .

as one of the best first year

8-12 from the field and finished
the contest with 21 points and

Brown combined with Robert
Morris graduate Jim Dashield to
tear holes in Pitt’s elusive
shifting defense. Bach recounted
later what a difficult job that
was.

“There isn’t a guy in the coun-
try who likes to come to P.itts-
burgh to play Ridl and his boys,”
confided Bach. “We had to fight
for our lives against that shifting
defense and on the boards to-
night." -

The two schools started the
night out even and kept things
that way for the first ten min-’
utes as the score rested at 18-17,
PSU. The Lions then capital-
ized on three consecutive Pan-
ther turnovers to» build a ten
point lead at 29-19 from which

. the Cats never recovered.

Shooting only 28-78 from the
field (35.9 percent), the Cats

had trouble playing catch-up -

_to Coach Buzz Ridl, "We just

Matmen stomp \

Owls; win fifth

by MARK SIGMON

Allowing the Owls to capture only one bout, in addi-
tion to recording four pins themselves, the grapplers
chalked up their fifth consecutive dual meet victory with a
36-9 romp over Temple Saturday afternoon in Philadel-
phia.

With four matches remaining before the Eastern In-
tercollegiate Wrestling Association‘ (EIWA) tournament
(Feb. 25-26 at Temple), the improving matmen have
demonstrated that they are capable of battling with. the
best. Head Coach Dave Adams is proud of his squad.

“Like I said earlier_in the season,” explained Adams,
"our team ‘is a late-comer. Every wrestler is doing his
best. We finally have that necessary confidence that spells
the difference. We’ve had more pins this year than any
team I have ever coached here at Pitt.”

Lud Hancza_r’s season debut Saturday is an example ‘

of the matmen’s morale. Plucked out of the dorms Friday
morning, when. 126 pounder Randy Payne suffered a reoc-
- curence of the flu, Hanczar was seven pounds overweight.

Despite his sucking weight till minutes before the weigh-'

in Saturday morning, Lud battled Temple’s highly regard-
ed Jim Adams before dropping a 7-2 decision. ‘

“What Lud did this weekend is typical of the fantastic
attitude the entire squad has right now,” remarked Coach
Adams.

Although he qualified for the 1971 NCAA tourney at
177, Craig Tritch (190) has had a rather disheartening.
season thus far. However, Tritch regained his former
aggressiveness Saturday and pushed Roy Baker, the 1971

District 2 Qualifying champ and 1971 Wilkes Open runner-.

up, all over the mat before settling for a 1-1 draw.

“Craig had‘ Baker running the I entire bout,” said
Coach Adams. “Baker was warned for stalling in "the sec-
ond period, but the referee just refused to penalize him.”

George “-Fuddy” Bryant gained his. 13th triumph of
the year with a third period pin over Bill Feichtl. PIAA
state champ at 115 in_1971, “Fuddy” should get the num-

State’s Tom Teagarden on Feb. 15.

Avenging a 4-0 loss last year.to Glen Dunham, Pan-
ther Gary McClure, replacing the injured Dave Wylie at
134, decked his Temple foe at 1 :23.

Gaining his fourth consecutive fall, _150 pounder
Kevin Love put Garth Hickey away at 4:31. John “Bimbo”

ber two seed at 118-in'the‘Easterns if he can defeat Penn V

Chatman regained his winning form with a pin over Har- -

ry Aronis at 158. . ‘

Veteran’ 167 pounder. Jim Fleming continued his vic-
torious performances with a 3-0 shutout over Tim Mar-
tella. Co-captain Willie Saloky (177) lifted his record to
2-1 by mauling Bob Paladino, 7-1.

-Both John Buzzatto’ (142) and heavyweight George
Calcagnini drew with their Temple opponents.

_ “We were able to add new tricks to our routines with-
out-having to fear if we missed because we. knew how

Swerdlow, Dan Campbell, and other Pitt gymnasts did
just that as the gymnasts 2-‘4,lost 148.25 to 127.30 Saturday

Under the encouragement of assistant coach Ig Pe- I

but hurt it because I lacked form,” said Swerdlow. How-
ever, he scored a _very credible 7.1. '

Temple meet (lecicled

in ﬁnal relay race

(Continued from Page 9)

Pitt team record set by Al Morris
of 2:23.2 last year.

Mark Cohen had a tough Satur-
day afternoon, topping Temple
star Dan Gal1agher’s time in
three events but winning only one
race.

In the first event of the meet,
the 400‘ yard medley relay Cohen
swam an anchor leg of 50.4 sec-
onds, bettering Ga1lagher’s time
of 51.7, but he started the race
behindby four bodylengths due to
an excellent initial leg swam by
Temple’s best backstroker Wayne
King.

In the final relay event, the 400
yard freestyle relay, Cohen and
Gallagherdueled again, both an-
choring their team’s squads.

Gallagher again was the benifi-
ciary of a slight margin from the
start which was the difference at
the finish. Cohen swam the third
fastest time of the season for the
Pitt team and the fastest of his ca-
reer with a clocking of 49.1 sec-
onds but that wasn't enough as
Gallagher swam a 49.3. ,

Cohen was able to gain some
measure of revenge as he and co-
captain Rick Rowe teamed up for
a one-two finish in the 100 yard
freestyle with Gallagher finishing
third.

Another outstanding Owl swim-
mer who was shut out in the1000
yard freestyle was Dave Skudin,
an All-American in high school,
an All-East performer, All-State,
and all-everything at Long Beach
High in New York.

Fred Lewis continued his unde-
feated string of 1,000 yard free-
style victories by waltzing to a
comfortable win in the event with
a slow time of 11:22.

helped him back onto the road of
success by winning the 200 but-

pace posting good times of 1:54

Orangemen
edge Temple

While the Panther basketball
team is floundering through mid-
season doldrums, two of their up-
coming opponents had quite a bat-
tle over the weekend. A

Syracuse, boasting a 12-3 rec-
ord, edged Temple 84-77 in an
overtime contest. Guard Greg
Kohls, the nation’s fifth leading
scorer, hit three key baskets in
the overtime period to give the
Orangemen the win.

«Kent State, the Panthers’ next
opponent, whipped Ohio Univer-

' sity, 88-74. Earlier in the season,

Ohio U. had upset several top
ranked midwestern teams.

Virginia Tech plastered Pitt’s
next foe, William and Mary by an
87-65 margin. The Panthers face
W&M this Saturday night.

In pro draft

by MARTY HELLMAN
Associate Sports Editor

The immediate future of hun-
dreds of senior collegiate football
players will be decided tomorrow
as pro football’s two day extra-
vaganza of selecting talented ath-
letes begins.

A handful of Pitt seniors will be
among the draftees, though not
one of them is expected to be chos-
en too quickly."

Top candidate for the coveted

Low numbers wanted

honor of the nation's number one
pick is Walt Patulski, the mam-
moth defensive lineman from No-
tre Dame. Bobby Moore, the Paci-
fic Eight’s leading\ rusher this
year from Oregon, and John
Reaves, the record setting quar-
terback from Florida, are also
rated highly by scouts.

Buffalo has the; first choice in
the proceedings and new coach
Lou Saban will have the honors
of taking it.

P|'fT SENIOR Ralph Cindrich causes Notre Dame fumble around the goal line
in last fall's one-sided Irish victory. Cindrich hopes to be drafted in

tomorrow's annual pro draft.

According to ex-Panther line-
backer Ralph Cindrich, center

‘Bob Kuziel may be the first Pan-

ther to be drafted. "I think Kuz is
going to go really high." he said
last week.

Kuziel was impressive in two
post-season bowl games — the
East—West Shrine game and the
Hula.Bowl.

Cindrich realizes that his draft
status is in question due to his
knee injuries of the past two
years. “A lot of teams contacted
me about the knee,” he remarked.
“I’ll bet more teams talked to me
than most of the other guys that
will go higher,” he quipped.

Ralph also feels that Joel Klim-
ek, the Panthers experienced
tight end has an excellent chance
for a high round selection;

Cindrich believes that Joe Car-
roll, his co-linebacker for the past
several seasons, will get a good
chance.

“Joe has great natural ability——
he runs the 40 yard dash in great
time and .he is very agile,” com-
mented Cindrich.

Steve Moyer, the Panthers’ rec-
ord breaking flanker, also has a
good. shot at being selected, as
does guard John Simpson and mid-
dleguard Jack Dykes.

After analyzing everyone else’s
chances, Cindrich warned that
"I’m not sure when I’ll go, but I
just hope I get the chance to play
somewhere.”

Last year, a total of 12 Pan-
thers were either drafted or sign-
ed as free agents by the pros.

Sports Editor

Last Friday the Pitt Athletic
Department took a step directed
at bolstering the athletic program
by appointing assistant football
_coach Serafino Fazio to the posi-
tion of full time recruiter.

Fazio, known affectionately on
the hill as "foge." will have the
official title of assistant to the
director of athletics in charge of
recruiting. His responsibilities
will lie in the "establishment of
vast new networks of recruiting
for Pitt,” related his new boss
Casimir Myslinski. «

Myslinski indicated that Fazio
will be directly responsible to the
director, ‘meaning that if a change
in coachingsituation should occur
at Pitt in the future, Foge’s job
would not be in danger-

Head Coach Carl DePasqua was
very pleased with this new devel-
opment in the grid program.
“This is a very positive, progres-
sive decision that will solidify our
total program,” said DePasqua.
“We are extremely fortunate to
have a man of Foge’s capibilities.
In my three years, he has proven
to be an exceptional recruiter.”

Myslinski echoed DePasqua’s
confidence in Fazi0’s recruiting
abilities but also expressed cau-
tion.

"This is the kind of job‘ that you
can’t tell how effective the man is
until the results come in,” said
the AD. “It can be a real goof off
-job. Fazio will be_entirely on his
own and there is very little way of_
checking up on him. He has been
tops for us in recruiting so far
though3’

  
   
 
   
    
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
 
 
 
 
   

“FOGE” FAZIO
On His Own

A 32 year old native of Corao-if

polis, Pa., Fazio was the Panther-— —

er’s starting center in 1958 and‘

1959, winning the MVP Award in ’ ‘f
his senior year in addition to being. "

named to the All-East squad and .
honorable mention All-American.
Both his youth and experience _

have proven to be valuable assets "if I

for the Panthers since he came to.‘
Pitt in 1969. Last season Foge
served as defensive coordinator. /

Whether a replacement-for Fa'- A

zio in the coaching ranks is ne- .

cessary is up to DePasqua. It is

the head coach’s responsibility to I »

determine how much assistance
he will need in molding a squad.

With the return of Steve Petro in
to the coaching ranks (Petro has

been mostly preoccupied with re-__
cruiting under DePasqua), the

need for an addition of personnel

may be eliminated.
