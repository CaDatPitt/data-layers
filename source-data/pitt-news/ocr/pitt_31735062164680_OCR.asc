Professors Submit Resignations

Dean of Faculties Calls Resignation
Rate of 110 a Year Normal at Univ.

ByBILLCABIN

It’s all in the game, typi-
ﬁes the university‘s explan-
ation of recent faculty resig-
nations. Dean of Faculties,

‘Stanton Crawford presented

the University’s position.

“I don’t think their depar-
ture is any more significant
now than‘ at any other time,”
said Crawford. He denied im-
plications which linked the resig-
nations to Uniyersity ﬁscal prob-
lems.

“It’s just to be expected,” said
Crawford. “We’ve been averag-
ing a 10 to 11 per cent turnover
rate in faculty since 1958, and
that’s lower than most universi-
ties. Our current faculty num-
bers 1,100, and I expect 110 or
or more to leave this year.

Crawford feels most turnover
occurs on the lower faculty levels
among members about 30 years
old. “Our classiﬁcation includes
instructor, assistant professor, as-

isociate professor, and full pro-

fessor,” he said. “Most of the
faculty are instructors and assis-
tant professors.

“The younger faculty members
are usually in these positions,”
he said, “and they are mainly
looking for an advancement. We
.are apt to lose more people there,
simply because we have more
there.” He did admit “we lose
some all the way up and down
the scale.”

. Crawford substantiated the .10-
11 per cent turnover rate with
statistics, but he could not pro-
vide statistical proof of the pro-
portion of young faculty mem-
bers.

Most losses, Crawford contends,
accur for personal or administra-
tive reasons. “Members mayileave
for many reasons such a geo-
graphic preferences, university
preferences, or increased prestige
of new positions.” . .

Losses also occur from people

reaching retirement age, deaths,
and contract expirations. Instruc-
tors and assistant professors are
under three year appointments,
having optional renewal.

University systems of exchange .

obviously operate under the prin-
ciple of imperfect competition.
“There is always some exchange
between schools,” said Crawford.

“A school will usually put an
emphasis on building up certain
areas,” he said. “At any time,
you will ﬁnd some schools more
active in some ﬁelds than in
others. It depends on which stage
we’re in when other schools are
actively seeking faculty in cer-
tain areas. It’s a matter of supply
and demand.”

“Our prime goal is evening up
inequalities between departments
as far as the available money

will allow,” said Crawford. “Cur- -

rently, we feel most of our de-
partments are fairly equal.”

D of  Stanton Crawford

When Chancellor Edward Litch-
ﬁeld came here in 19518, the school
began an extensive physical and
academic expansion. Faculty mem-
bers were gained from other in-
stitutions in the process of in-
increasing the University’s aca-
demic status.

Current ﬁscal problems at the
University allow other schools to
practice similar tactics. They
seek new faculty, and often of-
fer substantial rank and salary
increases. Other schools become
hunters, and the University is
their prey.

“We’d like to compete,” said
Crawford staunchly, “but we can't
let faculty salaries get out of
line. If a person’s salary is in-
creased to prevent resignation,
other faculty members will clam-
or for raises.”

“We do all that’s reasonable
without being too unfair,” he
concluded.

1 Restrictions

On Credits

Announced

Assistant Dean of the
School of the Liberal Arts
Russel A. Dixon has \again
reminded all students of the
limitations on advanced
standing credits earned at a sum-
mer session at another univer-
sity.

According to the 1964 edition

I of the Student Handbook, any

student who wishes to supple-
ment his program in the School
of Liberal Arts by taking courses
at another university's summer
session must ﬁrst clear the courses
he desires to take with the ‘Lib-
eral Arts Advising Center. A stu-
dent cannot expect credit for
courses not cleared through the
Advising Center.

Further, the courses. taken
should only be electives. Accord-
ing to Dean Dixon, “Since dis-
tribution of studies courses (80
and 180 series) are unique in

purpose, structure and presenta-

tion and are not the equivalent

of the beginning or elementary-

course in a discipline, normally
no course in another school can
be taken to satisfy a distribution
of studies requirement.”

A course in the student’s ma-
jor (or in his approved related
ﬁeld) may be taken only if it
has the written endorsement of
the major adviser or the chair-
man of that department. Also
the student must have satisfac-
tory academic standing at the
time of registration and “indica-
tions of so continuing.”

Betty Furness Speaks for VISTA

Betty Furness, radio and
television personality, will
speak on “Project VISTA

the Supper Room.

Miss Fumess has joined the
President’s War on Poverty as a
lecturer and recruiter at colleges
and universities and is currently
on a speaking tour of Pittsburgh

.. area colleges and universities.

Her goal is to recruit volunteer
workers for “Project Head Start,”

Betty Furness,” in which she an-

she was a motion picture actress
and a performer on Broadway.

She is the only women to have
been president of the New York
chapter of the National Academy
of Television Arts and Sciences
and the only person to have held
the office for two terms.

As hostess of “Dimension of a

Boyer, Copeland, and Meyer; 
are all associate professors, while 
both Englesberg and Bus. are full’

cause the resignations.

Boyer will become head of the  
political science department at ‘T1
Kansas State University. “This of- D 
fer has been about a. year in they-i_'__j,_'
making,” he said. “They ﬁrst all-"5,
proached me when I was .on a, 
two year leave ‘in Pakistan

earlier this year.”

Boyer denies that his resigna- 
tion has any relation to the Uni-‘ 
versity’s ﬁnancial stress, thought; 
he will receive both an increase If,

in status and salary.

“I’ve been here ten years as
an associate professor,” said Boy-‘-
er, “and this job offers me a big 
improvement in my profession." 
The school has 10,000 students}
and is growing at a rate of 1,100 
a year. They want to develop a r W

emphasized that he decided  

leave “regardless of anything go:-',

“I’ve been contemplating for

A Center for International
Biomedical Communications
Research has been establish-
ed jointly by the University
of Pittsburgh and the Ex-
cerpta Medical Foundation.
The Research Center will be
located at the Knowledge Avail-
ability Systems Center at the
University. «

The objective of the Research
Center is the development of new
international communication tools
and techniques which will pro-
vide both individual physicians
and medical teams in the United
States and in other countries
with r.apid access to important
scientiﬁc ﬁndings discovered any-
where in the world.

In an announcementmade by
the University and Excerpta Med-
ica, the Center was described as
“a unique combination of medi-
cal, scientiﬁc and technical cap-
abilities and resources, essential
for the development and imple-
mentation of an effective pro-
gram for improving international
medical communication.”

The priority projects under-
taken by the Center are (1) the

determination of the actual in-
formation needs of medical sci-
entists and (2) the development
of highly detailed subject head-
ing lists for each of the medical
specialties, to be eventually in-
tegrated into a master system of
biomedical indexing terms. Ex-
cerpta Medica has already been
at work on the latter project for
several years.

The University will make avail-
able to the Research Center the
services and facilities of its med-
ical, computer, and information
sciences’ ﬁacilities. The Universi-
ty’s electronic data processing
equipment and technical experts
will also be placed at the dis-
posal of the Center.

Excerpta Medica, which is the
largest international medical ,ab-
stracting service, with offices in
six countries, will draw on its
permanent medical staff of 54

specialists in charge of 35 ab-'

stracting journals and other ref-
erence works prepared by the
Foundation, the 700 clinicians
and researchers prepresented on
its international editorial boards
and the 6,000 physicians who par-

Army Basic Training

By Jim O’Brien

(This is the first in a two part series by former Pitt News Sports editor Iim
U Brien about his experiences with basic training. O’Brien graduated from the
University in 1964 and is now a private ﬁrst class in the United States Army.)

Having successfully en-

1.» dured, or simply outlasted,

ezthe debasing experience of

basic combat training, I now
have a clearerunderstanding
of what the word “Army”

.' entails.

During this past Winter of

' Discontent, some of your tax

in o n e y was
spent in a fu-
tile eight-
week attempt
to transform
in e f r o m a
contented ci-
vilian into a

dier.

 sort of experience that is fun
' only in retrospect.

THOUGH I have no olive-
drab aura about me, I must
admit it was certainly an
enriching experience. Now I
can truthfully say I have
met, and shaken hands with,
all of the absurb and won-
derful characters I had here-
tofore thought were drawn
only in the black humorist
minds of Joseph Heller, Nor-
man Mailer and Jim Jones.

This is something many of
my friends will never ever
know. Some of them are
married, some are still in

or past histories of ulcers,
asthma, nervous ticks or
“mental illness.”

Accommodated by a qui-
xotic draft law, none of them
will have to serve. And nei-

their will anyone else who.

nabs a wife in time or has
the money to make a career
out of going to class.

AND IT IS to these lucky
slobs that this series of col-
umns is dedicated. To those
who solemnly believe that
“they also serve who only
sit and wait.”

For starters, let us say the
Army is anti- intellectual.
Imagination is subordinate
to the Army way of doing
things. In our company area,
for example, there -was on
open box labeled "‘sugges-
tion forms.” It was empty
for eight weeks.

All college men are re-
garded as degenerates and
deviates. “I’ve only had a
fourth-grade education and
I can do it-” growls the lea-
ther-tongued sergeant at the
B.A. man.

In their behalf, let me say
that sergeants, God bless
’em, are the most virtuous
men in the world. They treat
everybody like dirt, regard-
less of race,. creed, color,
place of national origin or
alma mater. Boola! Boola!

MOST‘ OF the trainees,
especially those who joined
up on their own, or with the
urging of their truant offi-
cer, read comic books and
consider Mad magazine far
superior.to The New Yorker.

Serious reading had to be
on the sly because pla-
toon sergeant - suspected - all

subversive. I was ordered
to throw away a copy of
“The Last Hurrah.” ’
Culture was held in con-
tempt. A Pitt coed sent me
a perfumed postcard with a
reprint of “The Naked Ma-
ja” adorning one side. “We
got a lot of horney men
around here, O’Brien,” my
sergeant said. “They smell
or see this and they’ll be
crawling into your bed at
night. Now tear it up.” Let
us all be thankful that ser-
geants don’t frequent art
galleries. Mona Lisa would be
ordered to “wipe that silly
smile off your face, dud.”
The single —sy1labled ser-

geants possessed enough na-

tive insight to realize that
a college man had a mind and
and they noticed that people
with minds tended to get
pretty smart at times. Such
men were -dangerous an-d

Protests

   

Inconsistent
By Alex D’Ippolito

_ With today’s emphasis on higher education it is some-
times _interesting to stop and take a look _at_ what our uni-
versitiesand colleges are turmng out as finished products_

It didn’t take too muc-h looking two weekends ago to
ﬁnd_ some of these educational by-products picketing the
White House protesting, of course, U.S. policy in South
Vietnam. While most of their colleagues were eating Sedar
dinners at their Grandma’s, hunting for colored eggs on
their lawns, or frolicking on Daytona’s
beaches these four year wonders were de-
manding that Yankee come home.

The unusual thing about the recent stu-
ent protests and demonstrations is not the
ali_dity of their motives or the sincerity of
heir actions but rather the inconsistencies
f their positions.

AMERICAN POLICY in Vietnam (and
any other place in the world) is always open
to questions and honest debate. But why
is it only w-hen the United States does
something unpleasant that 152 Yale faculty
members send a withdrawal petition to the President, stu-
dents at George Washington University go on hunger
strikes, University of Michigan professors threaten not to
teach, 15,000 students picket the White House, and the stu-
dents and faculty of Harvard stage a ‘teach-in” protest?

Where was Yale when Russia drove tanks into Buda-
pest firing on youths aimed with rocks and clubs? N o loud
protest came from th_is hallowed Ivy League institution
when 20,000 Hungarians were butchered in the streets and
hanged from lamp posts.

No decreases in the size of student cafeteria lines were
reported when in 1962 Red China launched an unprovoked
attack on India and occupied land which the Reds, still
haven’t given up. _

Classes went on as usual at the University of Michigan
as the professors dutifully recommended the New York

AND THE WALKS in front of 1600. Pennsylvania
Avenue were pedestrian-free while dozens of East Berliners

tried to make it over the Wall but were stopped by Com-

munist bullets in their backs. _

With nary a Harvard class interrupted, American em-
bassies have been stoned, mobbed, and burned on the aver-
age of one a month for the last several years and the only
protests forthcoming were the traditional notes from the
State Department. . "

There are hundreds of atrocities committed around the
globe, mostly in Communist countries or other dictatorships,
with crimes ranging from lootings, -beatings, and murders.
to suppressions of every political and social liberty known
to man. Most of these crimes go unprotested over here.

But when Uncle Sam deviates from the straight and
narrow then the protests begin.

There is no doubt of the honesty and sincerety of the
desires of the ban-‘the-bomb, get-out-of-Vietnam, disarm-
the-U.S. groups; and there is no doubt that the vast ma-

‘ jority of them are not Communists or sympathizers.

Vietnam

No Expansion

Our expansion of the war
in Viet Nam is dangerous
and mistaken.

The logic of our policy of
expanding the war to the
North is as follows. Premise
one: North Vietnam (and
China indirectly) is respon-
sible for and has control over
the Vietcong
r e b e 1 l i o n.
Premise two:
If threatened
t h r o u g ‘h
bombing the
North Viet-
namese and
Chinese will
back down.
Conclusion: --
The war in

    

 4

South Vietnam can be won '

by bombing North Vietnam.
Premises one and two, how-
ever, are not self - evident
truths. They are assump-
tions which are very ques-
tionable.

The White Paper on Viet-
nam that our government
released for publication. last
month is supposed to .docu-
ment the assumption that
the Viet Cong Rebellion is a
creation of North Vietnam.

‘ It fails miserably.

IN A PENETRATING
analysis reprinted in the
News of the Week in Re-
view section of The New
York Times, I. F. Stone
points out several glaring
weaknesses. The paper says

"‘Incontravertabl‘;é.i evidence

of Hanoi’s elaborate pro-
gram to supply its forces in
South with weapons,‘ am-
munition, and other supplies
has accumulated ‘over the
years.” In Appendix D the
evidence is detailed.

From June‘1962 to Janu-
ary 29, 1964 we had captur-
ed a total of 179 Viet Cong
weapons that were Commun-
ist made. What the report
fails to say is that during
this sa.me period we captur-
ed over 7500 weapons from
the Viet Cong. I. F. Stone,
a good reporter, got the lat-
ter figure by simply placing
a call to ‘the Pentagon. Thus
out of 7500 weapons captur-
ed from the Viet Cong we
found that 17 9 are Com-
munist made.

That’s less than 21/;%'.
The U.S. is so fair-minded
that we are making weapons
for both sides.

APPENDIX C PUTS the
number of “confirmed” mili-
tary infiltrators from North
Vietnam at 19,550. I put
“confirmed” in quotes be-
cause the number of such
men captured is not given
and we are not told how this
estimate was arrived at. Giv.
en the aim of the White
Paper-justiﬁcation for ex-
panding‘ the war—we may
reasonably suspect exagger-
ation. »

Further, of the 23 Viet-
Cong sent South by North
Vietnam, whose case histor-
ies are given in the‘ White
Paper, 17 are natives of
South Vietnam. This hardly
sounds like a war of inva-
sion.

The White Paper fails to
establish that the Viet Cong
rebellion is staffed and sup-
plied from North Vietnam.
If the Viet Cong rebellion
is in fact based on indigen-
ous support. Bombing North
Vietnam will not end our
troubles in the South.

Let us assume, however,
in spite of all the evidence

to the contrary, -that prem-_

ise oneis tenable. If we con-
tinue bombing North Viet-
nam, we will drive them to
the brink. They will then do
one of two things: call off
the Viet Cong—if they can,
or strike back by over-run-
ning South Vietnam. There
should be. no doubt that the
North Vietnam is capable of
the latter; next to China
they have the strongest mil-
itary force in Southeast
Asia.

IF NORTH VIETNAM in-
vaded South Vietnam, the
U. S. would send troops.
China would also intervene.
At best we would become
bogged down in a land war
on the Asian continent. Han-
son Baldwin, military editor
of The New York Times,
who advocates such -a policy,
says that in order to save
South Vietnam we will have
to send one million men to
war. At worst we risk trig-
gering World War III.

Because South Vietnam is
not vital to U. S. security
interests such a risky pol-
icy is lunacy .

No doubt North Vietnam
would be more rational to
choose the first alternative,
to call off the Viet Cong. We
can not (be sure, however,
that they have the power.
The evidence indicates that
the Viet Cong rebellion’s ori-
gin and main source of sup-
port is from South Vietnam.

Dr. George A“; Jeffrey, director of the
crystallography laboratory, has been named
University professor, announced by Dr.

I ~ Charles H. Peake, vice chancellor for the

academic disciplines.
“To D-r. Jeffrey’s credit is the national
and international reputation enjoyed by

‘ Pitt’s crystallography laboratory,”,D'r.

Peake said. “This year alone the laboratory
has a dozen post-doctoral research associ-
ates from such leading American universi-
ties as ' Harvard and Princeton as well as
from institutions in England, Australia,
Canada, Taiwan, Sweden, Hungary and Ger-
many.”

Dr. Jeffrey’s appointment is effective

immediately. Until now he has held profes-
7  sorships in three departments: chemistry,

physics and earth and planetary sciences.
“But by arrangement,” said Dr. Peake,
“he may assume the privileges and respon-

 .2 sibilities of membership in any aPP1‘0P1'iat°

faculty of the University.”
The laboratory, which studies the spa-
cial pattern of atoms, touches almost every

ﬁeld of science. The new interdepartmental _

status is expected to streamline the labora-

tory’s operation and make it more accessi-
ble to all appropriate departments and
schools, Dr. Peake said.

Dr. Jeffrey, author of about 90 publica-
tions, studied at the University of Birming-
ham, England, for the degree of B.Sc. with
Honors in chemistry and the Ph.D. In
1950-51, he was a visiting professor at the
University.

Dr. Jeffrey is chairman of the National

Committee for Crystallography and was a -

member of the National Academy of Sci-
ences National research Council Study
Group on the Desalination of Water in 1962-.

The laboratory now has a staff of about
30 people including professors, graduate stu-
dents, undergraduate assistants, and post-
doctoral associates.

Current research includes studies of cry-\

stals containing large amounts of water-
of ‘interest in the desallination program
sponsored by the U.S. Department of the
Interior. Dr. J effrey’s primary interests

are in the study of crystal and molecular V

structures by the techniques of X-ray cry-
stallagrophy.

Manuscripts

By MARTHA FRY .
Some people may have the impression
that creative writing at the University has
been in a slump this past year because they
have seen little of it in print. Manuscripts,
the English Department’s literary maga-
zine, turned its last issue over to teaching
materials; Ideas and Figures, the student
literary magazine, devoted its last issues to any
exclusive breed of poetry; and The Pitt News,
quite properly, has established a policy of never
publishing ﬁction or poetry.

This impression can now be tested, for Manu-
scripts has returned to its old format of ﬁction,
essays and poetry, and the current issue publishes
the ﬁrst broad sample of student writing in some
time. Most readers will ﬁnd it still quite healthy.

In Richard Matlak’s “A Seat for Everyone,”
by a high school senior, is torn between ﬁaunting
his superiority over the “clods” by showing up at
Awards Day and making a clean sweep of the
honors, or hiding from the hostility and harrass-
ment of those same clods. Matlak builds up his
conﬂict with absolutely convincing detail, includ-
ing the obese here’s insulting nickname—nothing
so overworked as Fatty—he is called Babycakes.

Anne's Fertik’s “When a, Poor Man Came in
Sight” is probably closest to personal experience
(it is obviously set at the University), and yet
her lovely story shows no strain in tone.

“Ambiguous,” by Paul Barron, deals with a
young boys thoughts about his father. It may at
ﬁrst glance seem to be a simple, surprise-ending
story, but reference to Plato’s allegory of the cave
leads the story into endlessly dovetailing ambigui-
ties, as the title would suggest. Barron has at-
tempted something very complicated and executed
it cleverly.

The last. three stories present characters which
logically could not have been derived from the
author’s experience, but are just as convincing as
the ﬁrst three. In “Just a Little Loving and Under-
standing,” Sue Evans follows a neurotic middle-
aged woman through a harrowing evening as a
volunteer helper at a mental hospital. Her writ-
ing is smooth and astute, but a little heavy-handed.

The title phrase, for instance, is repeated in
the story four times where once would be enough,
and other psychological hints and foreshadowings

are given too obviously and too often. For this one
fault, it is the weakest story in the magazine,
which is a lefthanded way of saying that it is a
good story among better stories.

Danelle McDonal dmoves inside the mind of
a Negro mother who kills a white woman in a
flash of anger in “The Children.” This story uses
a ﬁshback riddled with anachronisms, but it is
emotionally accurate and timely.

The ﬁnal story, “The Interview,” by Carol
Marino, is a swift but persuasive resume of a
middle-aged man who doesn’t play the organiza-
tion game. Where she met this man we’ll never
know, but since she knows about the warm Her-
shey bars in his pockets, it is easy to believe that
she knows everything else about him too.

The ﬁve pieces of poetry in this issue span a
wide range of subtlety and complexity. At one
end is Marc Sobel’s simple and compact, “Voices.”
Helen Jahn, who has previously published short,
epigrammatic bits, presents something longer and
more complicated in form in her “Clay and Earth,”
but her idea is readily grasped.

Midway in complicatedness is’ J. M. Craw-
ford’s “k’un ch’u” which evokes three facets, both
of time and mood, of the Japanese traveling actor.

And ﬁnally, there are Rick Klein’s “AGAIN / old
lover, old land” and Andy Welsh’s “And Varia-
tions” to be wrestled with. Rich Klein makes a
succinct, intuitive statement about poetry. Its
form may put people oif—one person wondered
why words are hyhenated as they are.

I think it is done to pour the sentences into
a metrical form, and that it is not meant to con-
vey any meaning other. than the words would in
unhyhenated form—but with Rick Klein one is
never sure. The word “heart/s” is written that
way for the same reason that we write “and/or”
—take both meanings. ..

Andy Welsh’s poem contains these lovely lines:

‘ Old moments come to find us,
Come like searching dogs,
Snifing hopefully up to us,
And then, disappointed, leave.
In ten short episodes like this he handles his
“theme,” the endless interior dialogue of man-
kind.

And come to think of it, so perhaps does every-

thing in the magazine.

Hours Restricted  

College Press Service

Regulations governing dormitory hours and require-
ments for women are coming under increased scrutiny on
many campuses. The social regulations committee of the
Associated Women Students at Stanford University have
recently completed a survey of practices at other institu-
tions and made recommendations for a new hours policy

here.

Ten of the 34 schools surveyed by Stanford indicated
that they now permit upperclass women to sign out over-

snight. At Antioch and Reed this
privilege is unrestricted. However,
at Oregon, Colorado, Northwest-
tern, Cornell, Washington. In St.
Louis, Radcliffe, UCLA, and Mi-
ami in Ohio, it is usally accom-
panied by one or more qualiﬁca-
tions, most commonly high aca-
demic standing, being over 21, or
having parental permission.
The committee recommended
' that dormitory closing hours for
freshmen be extended and that
junor and senior women have op-
tions for overnight privileges.
Women students the University
have expressed very strong sup-
port for the proposed changes,

’ but their adoption would require

a two-thirds vote of the student
legislature plus presidential and-
trustee approval.

A survey of parental feelings
indicated that 97 of those ques-
tioned favored no change from
the present policy which does
not allow overnights. About 30

parents favored more conserva-.

tive hours than the present ar-
rangement, which allows upper-
women to sign out until 2:30 a.m.
daily.

Elsewhere, the Board of Trus-
tees at the State University of
Ohio ruled recently that all stu-
dents under 21 years o£»_ age who
‘are not married or living with
their parents must live in dormi-
tories by 1967.

This puts into effect a policy
approved eight years ago. It has
not been enforced, however, be-
031156 Of a shortage of on-campus
housing.

“One intent of enforcing the
rule is to have all women stu-
dents under 21‘ living on campus
35 S0011 as Possible,” said Gordon
B. Carson, vice-president of busi.
ness and ﬁnance for the univer-
sity. He said this could be viewed
as protective measure.

Fraternities and sororities will
be excused from meeting the

 

*8!-

regulation.

Administration officials at the
University of Oregon were sur-
prised recently when they sent
a questionnaire to parents ex-
ploring their reactions to giving
coeds overnight privileges.

Many of the replies came back
marked “YES” in the square
quering whether women students
could check out of their campus
living quarters for a night in the
home of male friends. “I don't
think they expected parents to
say it was O.K.,” said a univer-

\ sity source.

The survey was conducted in
conjunction with a long-range
planning study of dormitory
needs at the university. Stafford
Hansell, state representative ask-
ed the university to explain why
they included the question in
the survey. -

There will be a meeting for

Playing the lead is a relatively small group of former
college students who borrowed money under the National
Defense Education Act (NDEA) of 1958 and who have not

prepaid on time.

NDEA supplies federal money
for college loan funds. Federal
contributions amount to 90 per
cent of each school's loan fund;
the school makes up the differ-
ence and admisters the fund.

NDEA loans require no pay-
ments while a student is in col-
lege and no interest is charged
until one year after graduation.
On the second anniversary of
graduation and each year there-
after, one-tenth of the typical
loan plus three per cent inter-
est is due. Thus, full repayment
is due within ten years of the
start of payments.

And that’s where the problems

develop, according to some au-
thoriites. Payments past due on
October 31, 1964, comprises 0.7
per cent—or three million dol-
1ars—of the total amount of $443
million advanced under the pro-
gram. .
Since President J ohnson’s High-
er Education Act includes an ex-
tension of the student loan pro-
visions of NDEA, House and Sen-
ate subcommittees recently ex-
amined collection procedures and
other facets of the program.

Adding to Congressional inter-
est was .a report by the legisla-
tive»branch’s' ﬁnancial watch dog,
the General Accounting Office. In
November, the GAO pin-pointed
several inadequacies, including
collection procedures, in the
NDEA program.

Among those testifying before

_ the House Education SubCommit-

tee was a group of Washington,
D. C., area college loan officers.
In interviews later, . they cited
student misunderstanding and the
long period between gr.aduation
and the start of payments as pos-

sible reasons for delinquency. In 1

addition, one official thought col-
lection problems stemmed from
the program’s recent inception
(1959).

VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL

As everyone knows, thirteexi-twelfths of the earth’s surface is
water. Thus we can see how important it is to know a11d under-
stand our oceans. Toward this end American colleges last year
embarked on a program to increase enrollment in oceanography.
I am pleased to report that results were nothing short of spectac-
ular: In one single semester the number of students majoring in
oceanography rose by l00%—from one student to two!

But more oceanographers are still needed, and so today this
column, normally a vehicle for slapdash jocularity, will instead
devote itself to a brief course in oceanography. In view of the
solemnity of the subject matter, my sponsors, the Personna
Stainless Steel.Razor Blade Co., makers of Personna Stainless
Steel Razor 1-Blades which give you more luxury shaves than
Beep-Beep or any other brand you can name——if, by chance, you
don’t agree, the makers of Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blades

‘ will buy you’ a pack of whatever brand you think is better—my

sponsors, I say, the Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blade Co.
will today, because of the solemnity of this column, forego their
usual commercial message.

We begin our study of oceans with that ever-popular favorite,
the Paciﬁc. Largest of all oceans, the Paciﬁc was discovered by
Balboa, a Spanish explorer of great vision. To give you an idea of
Balboa’s vision. he first saw the Paciﬁc while standing on a peak
in Darien, which is in Connecticut.

The Paciﬁc is not only the largest ocean, but the deepest. The V T

. . . the Paciﬁc was discovered
by Balboa, a Spanish
explorer of great vision.

Mindanao Trench, off the Philippine Islands, measures more

than 5,000 fathoms in depth. (It should be pointed out here that

ocean depths are measured in fathoms—lengths of six feet—-
after Sir Walter Fathom, a British nobleman of Elizabethan
times who, upon his eighteenth birthday, was given a string six
feet long. Many young men would have sunk in a funk if all they
got for their birthday was a string six feet long, but not Sir
Walter! String in hand, he scampered around the entire coast of
England measuring seawater until he was arrested for loitering.
Incidentally, a passion for measuring seems to have run in the
family: Fathom’s grandnephew, Sir John Furlong, spent all his
waking hours measuring racetracks until Charles II had him be-
headed in honor of the opening of the London School of Econom-
ics.)

But I digress. Let us, as the poet Maseﬁeld says, go down to
the sea again. (The sea, incidentally, has ever been a favorite

B subject for poets and composers. Who does not know and-love

the many robust sea chanties that have enriched our folk music
—songs like “Sailing Through Kansas” and “I’ll Swab Your
Deck If You'll Swab Mine” and “The Artiﬁcial Respiration
Polka.’ ’)

My own favorite sea chauty goes like this: (I’m sure you all
know it. Why don’t you sing along as you read?)

Where I can live with honor,

And every place I ’ll shave my face

And read old Joseph Conrad,

And take my shaves upon the waves,
With Stainless Steel Personrad.-

Associate Collegiate Press

The Southwest Conference
(SWC) has recently witness-
ed two flagrant violations of
campus press freedom, says
the Battalion of Texas A&M
University. .

The SWC was once considered
above conﬁicts between student
editors and University officials
which periodically rage the coun-
try, but the facade of the SWC
.came crumbling down at Rice
and the University of Texas.

The two cases appear unre-
lated. The editor of the Rice
Thresher was placed on conduct

probation for not answering a ‘

summons from the dean. The
University of Texas Student Pub-
lications Board placed an embar-
go on the free distribution of the
Daily Texan outside the campus.

Both actions appear ordinary
and harmless. But let's take a
closer look.

Thresher editor Hugh Rice Kel-
ley was charged with deliberately
leaving the name of the news-
paper’s faculty advisor off the
masthead. He compounded this
crime by not speaking with the
the dean of students over the
phone-—because he was sick in
bed.

In reality, this faculty advi-
ser’s name had appeared in 14
of the last 21 issues but not in
the last four issues.‘ A letter ap-
pologizing to the irate dean for
not answering the telephone
brought no results. The disciplin-
action stood. The only recourse
was an appeal to the president
for at least due process punish-
ment, but this was also doomed

Papers

 

because the president’s authority
is necessary to impose the proba-
tion.

The real reason for Kelley’s
probation can be found in past
issues of the Thresher. Barbs
against the University's policy on
guest speakers and the regula-
tions on coed dress stung the
wrong people. The editor had to
removed—quietly to avoid bad
publicity — but nonetheless re-
moved.

The case of the Daily Texan
involves no action against its
editors but against its distribu-
tion. Censorship by restricting cir-
culation is much less likely to
bring serious outcries, though it

Censored

Members of the publications
board gave the expense of dis-
tributing free newspapers as their
reason for curtailing circulation.
A more liekly reason is the con-
stant embarrassment the Univer-
sity receives at the hands of this
controversial newspaper — es-
pecially when it is delievered
free to members of the Texas
legislature.

“The Word is out. If you want a man from Pitt, now
is the time to get him,” said Athletic Director Frank Car-



The university has fiscal problems, creating an atmos-
phere of uncertainty and insecurity. The result—faculty
members are prime targets for new job offers.

RUMORS about ﬁnancial problems have been circulating
since November, and Chancellor Edward Litchﬁeld admits
the university is under ﬁnancial stress.

Carver admits his budget has been cut “mainly con-
cerning operational expenses,” and the budget is “taking
longer to be released” this year. The university budget
covers the fiscal year from August 1965 to August .1966.
Carver has yet to receive his budget from newly-appointed
Director of the Budget Bob Dunkleman.

Director of Student Aid Jack Critchﬁeld also confirmed
the school’s fiscal dilemma in December, anticipating cuts
in the overall budget. All sources, however, refuse state-
ment of either the causes of the cut or the specific areas.

DURING last trimester alone, the athletic department
received resignations from head trainer Frank Weichec,
wrestling coach Rex Peery, and footballcoaches Ernie Hef-
ferle, Bill Kaliden, and Joe Pullekines.

Hefferle, Kaliden, and Peery have not been replaced
yet, and Carver seems in no hurry. “I know the, man we
want for wrestling,” Carver said, “It’s just a matter of get-
ting him. It could drag on for several more weeks.”

, When Hefferle was considering resignation, Carver un-
successfully attempted to persuade him to stay. “I asked
Ernie (Hefferle) for a ﬁgure to work with,” said Carver,
“but it was too high.” Hefferle now coaches for the Pitts-

burgh Steelers.

V AFTER Weichec resigned, Carver made Don Graham
head trainer, but cannot make further changes in the train-
ing area “until I hear from the money men.”
Despite all the indications of ﬁnancial stress, Carver
claims, “Financial pressures had nothing to do with any of

'_ the resignations.” He feels personal reasons caused the res-

ignations, and the fiscal status of the university was irrele-

vant.

' But ﬁnancial reasons are personal reasons. Kaliden,
"Weichec, and Hefferle not only receive increased profes-
sional status, but substantial pay increases.

- University finances affect faculty members’ ﬁnances,
making the school’s fiscal problems just as probable a
cause as any “personal” reason. _They may not have been
the only factor, but the uncertain ﬁnancial situation here
certainly makes faculty members more susceptable to new

offers.

 Next Two Weeks Key

 For Baseball Success

By TOM‘ SACKS
The next two weeks provide a crucial test for the un-

 defeated baseball team. The mitters now have a 6-0 mark,
 winning four on shutouts.

Pitching has been the key so far with the team’s four

. ‘pitchers allowing only 11 hits in six games. The four pitch-

ers in the starting rotation are Lee Brueckel, Dave Blyshak,

Don Stock, a.nd Paul Helsel.
If the pitching ~s1ackens, the

\ hitters must make up the de-

-ﬁciency. Except for Barry Wet-
zel, Fred Mazurek, and Tom

. Beckett, the hitting has not been

overwhelming. Wetzel is batting
.538, Mazurek, .500, and sopho-

_ more Beckett, .352.

“The hits have been timely for

._ us,” said Coach Bobby Lewis.
" ,“They came just when we need-

ed them against Syracuse.”

The biggest surprise of the
season is the sudden appearance
‘of Fred Mazurek on . the roster.

that he wouldn’t be playing, due

The day before the Norfolk
game, Mazurek told Lewis he
would be able to play. “No one
was more shocked than I was,”
said Lewis. Washington Redskin
coach Bill McPeak postponed Ma-
zurek’s signing until after the
baseball season.

Lee Brueckel,

- AVE BLYSHAK
Pitches Second Two-Hitter

By TOM SACKS
The New York Yankees biggest pub-
' licity draw is the M & M duo (Mickey Man-
tle and Roger Maris). The baseball team
now offers its own duo in pitchers Lee
Brueckel and Dave Blyshak (B & B).

With the team’s 6-0 record, Blyshak and Bruec-
kel share the credit for four of the ViCt0I‘1eS. In
four games, they have allowed only seven hits
and one run, striking out 37. Their most recent
success came with each pitching a two-hitter for
1-0 and 2-1 wins against Syracuse Saturday at
Forbes Field.

_ In the ﬁrst game, with Blyshak pitching, the
winning run came in the fourth inning when ﬁrst
baseman Barry Wetzel singled, driving in Tom
Beckett.

“That victory really gave us a good feeling
because it was (Ken) Borkhuis who beat us 2-0
last year up at Syracuse,”~_ said Coach Bobby Lewis.
Borkhuis was the loser. —

With the score tied 1-1 in the second game, the
mitters scored the winning run in the bottom of
the sixth inning. Warren Sordill and Beckett drew
walks and advanced one base on Fred Mazurek’s
single. Wetzel popped out with bases loaded, but
rightﬁelder Bill Bodle followed with a walk, scor-

The Orangemen’s only tally of the day was

regular shortstop Steve Kienzl was spiked and
had to be removed. Lewis then shifted second
baseman Steve. Eiseman to shortstop. On the next
play, Eiseman muﬁed the ball, allowing the run
to score.

Blyshak and Brueckel’s other two wins came

against Norfolk, 3-0 and 9-0, in .a twi-night double

header during the trimester break at Norfolk.
Blyshak allowed two hits and struck out nine,
while Brueckel tossed a one-hitter and whiﬂ’ed 13.

Last season Blyshak compiled a 3-4 record and
Brueckel didn't pitch. The team record was 9-13.

Chaotic Golfers Lose Opening Two Matches;
Meet WVU Today at Chartiers Valley Club

tomorrow at Forbesgi. Field at 3:30 ‘

  
 

The golf team opened an-
other unsuccessfulseason,
losing matches to West Vir-
ginia, 13-8, and Kent State,
5-4, during the‘ trimester
break.

Confusion has reigned with the

team since practice began nearly
a month ago. It seems like no-

» body knows what anybody should

do. ,

Mismanagement plagued the
team at tryouts. Candidates were
to practice at Chartiers Valley
Country Club and, turn their
scores in at the Field House. Each
player, however, had to pay to
tryout, without a University sub-

Asia?"   5

    

Besides money, a coach; was
also missing. Coach Rex Peery
was teaching at a wrestling clinic
in Baniﬂ’, Alberta, Canada, miss-
ing the opening matches.

Neither Peery nor anyone else
was around, but the athletic de-
partment graciously decided
someone should travel with the
team. They sent a Field House
ticket agent.

“I knew nothing about golf,”
said the agent. “But someone had
to go.”

In the opening’ match at West
Virginia, Phil Fassett and Jim
Blaschak were the team’s only
winners. Fassett defeated sopho-
more Steve Hague, six and ﬁve,
while Blaschak beat Jim Smith,
“"5 and; thr.¢¢~

Fassett won again in the dou-
bles, teaming with Clair Riley
to beat Mounties’ Dave Spann-
bauer and Hague, two and one.
Blaschak ‘teamed with Phil Aba-
ray, tying Tom Mason and Smith
in the ﬁnal doubles match.

West Virginia meets the golf-
ers again today at 1:30 p.m. at
Chartiers Valley Country Club.
Last Year the Mounties beat them
three times.

Friday, the golfers play George-
town at Chartiers at 1:30 p.m.

Dominate Spring Grid Game

By BILL CABIN
Fine passing by quarter-
backs Ken Lucas, Ed James,
and Jim Alcorn and the play
of halfback Eric Crabtree
highlighted the annual Blue-

White Intra-squad game
Saturday at the Stadium.
The Blues beat the Whites,
30-25.

Lucas ﬁgures as the team’s
top quarterback, completing 13
of 25 passes for the Blue. Two
completions were "touchdown
passes to Crabtree, while Lucas
also completed two-point conver-
sion passes to Crabtree and half-
back Bob Dyer.

Crabtree outplayed all other
backs. Besides catching two
touchdown passes, he scored on
runs of ﬁve and one yard, scor-
ing 28 points.

His key performance was in
the last six minutes with the
Blues trailing, 25-24. Lucas hit
him with a 15 yard pass on the
Whites’ 30 yard line, being hit
immediately by a defensive man.

But Crabtree gave a quick twist
and turn, breaking loose for a
30 yard run and the winning

— touchdown.

James was the Whites’ start-
ing quarterback, completing 10
of 18 with four interceptions.
During the ﬁrst half, James show-

Alcom could easily become the
team’s biggest surprise. He trans-

people feelhis chances .are slim,

He led the White team during
the second-half, utplaying James

passes. He completed ﬁve of 14
passes during the game, with the
touchdown tosses’ totaling 95

Both of Alcorn’s scoring throws

Shutout by Kent State, 9-0

By GEORGE LIES
Ken Perry impressed coach Ben Pope in the tennis
team’s 9-0 loss to Kent State Saturday.
~ Sophomore Perry led Ernie Kuhn, 40-0, but suddenly
choked and lost. “He isn’t as good as the number one boy
yet (Sam Donatelli), but he’ll come along and provide the
hub for future teams,” said Pope.
Marty Liebowitz and Rich Bloch also gained Pope’s
praise. “Behind Donatelli and (Larry) O’Loughlin come

Bloch and Liebowitz; both are
ﬁghting for that number one posi-
tion,” Pope said. “After them our
number ﬁve, six and seven men
are Kevin Berry, Perry, and Rich
Belzer.

“All of these boys are given «a
chance to beat out the top man
on the ladder, but without a
question or a doubt, Donatelli is
the best player we have,” said
Pope. “He is only 5'31/g” but he
has a. ﬁghting spirit and he hates
to lose.

“The only deterring factor is
that he is a little bit too short
for power,” he said. “O’Lough-
lin has tried to beat him out,
but he makes too many errors.”

After the ﬁrst loss, Pope proph-
esized about the season. “It’s
hard to be honest, but this sea-

son will be like last year. We’ll-

get clobbered. We don’t have
enough boys and certainly not
enough good ones. I’m going off
on a limb, but we should win
about four matches.”

Pope feels “the team has
"chances against teams like Slip-
pery Rock, Youngstown, Grove
City, and California State. “I’m
glad we dropped Navy and
Georgetown because we're not in
their class,” he said.

“Af course, once we get the
new courts, we will attract good
players again and have a good
team. Right now we’re in the

' dolddrums.”

Today, the team plays at Beth-

any, “a powerhouse” according
to Pope. The team’s fourth con-
secutive away‘ match is sched-
uled for Sunday at Indiana State.

Only two of the team’s 15
matches are at home this season.
They are against Westminster
May 6 and Youngstown May 20,
at the Carnegie Tech courts.

In the latest rumor poll,
Dave Johnson seems the
probable wrestling coach for
next season. Athletic Direc-
tor Frank Carver refuses to
conﬁrm the rumors. “We
have narrowed the choice to
one man,” Carver said. “Now
all we have to do is get him.
It could drag on for weeks.”

Johnson, however, was one of
three candidates being considered
several weeks ago. He earned
wrestling fame here winning the
157-pound class Eastern title in
1956, 1957, and 1958. He now
practices dentistry in East End.

Basketball coach Bob Timmons
has recruited two reputable fresh-
men, but still’ lacks a “big name”
player. Al DiFrischia and Tony
Delisio, both of Ellwood City,
have accepted Timmons’ oﬂfers.

DiFrischia is a six-foot-ﬁve-
inch center, who was a starter
two years at Ellwood City High
School. Delisio stands six-foot»
two, playing either guard or for-
ward, and led his section in scor-
ing last year. Both boys played
for the County All-Stars in a re-
cent Civic Auditorium game with
the City-Catholic All Stars.

“I’m afraid we won’t end up

mons. “I’ve been trying to get

By solving problems in astronautics, Air Force
scientists expand man’s knowledge of the universe. Lt. Howard McKinley, M.A.,
tells about research careers on the Aerospace Team.

:-

 

(Lt. McKinley holds degrees in electronics and electri-
cal engineering from the Georgia Institute of Tech-
nology and the Armed Forces Institute of Technology.
He received the 1963 Air Force Research & Devel-
opment Award for his work with inertial guidance
components. Here he answers some frequently-asked
questions about the place of college-trained men and
women in the U.S. Air Force.)

is Air Force research really advanced, compared to
what others are doing? It certainly is. As a matter of
fact. much of the work being done right now in uni-
versities and industry had its beginnings in Air Force
research and development projects. After all, when
you’re involved in the development of guidance sys-
tems for space vehicles—a current Air Force project
in America's space program—you’re working on the
frontiers of knowledge.

What areas do Air Force scientists get involved in?
Practically any you can name. Of course the principal
aim of Air Force research is to expand our aerospace
capability. But in carrying out this general purpose.
individual projects explore an extremely wide range

-of topics. “Side effects" of Air Force research are

often as important, scientiﬁcally, as the main thrust.

How important is the work a recent graduate can
expect to do? it's just as important and exciting as his
own knowledge and skill can make it. From my own
experience. I can say that right from the start I was
doing vital. absorbing research. That's one of the
things that's so good about an Air Force career—it
gives young people the chance to do meaningful work
in the areas that really interest them.

What non-scientiﬁc jobs does the Air Force offer?
Of course the Air Force has_ a continuing need for
rated ofﬁcers—pilots and navigators. There are also

 

».' -'_:...r. 

  
 

many varied and challenging administrative-manage
rial positions. Remember. the Air Force is a vast and
complex organization. It takes a great many different
kinds of people to keep it running. But there are two
uniform criteria: you've got to be intelligent, and
you‘ve got to be willing to work hard.

What sort of future do I have in the Air Force? Just
as big as you want to make it. In the Air Force, talent
has a way of coming to the top. it has to be that way,
if we're going to have the best people in the right
places, keeping America strong and free.

What's the best way to start an Air Force career? An
excellent way—the way I started-—is through Air Force
Officer Training School. OTS is a three-month course.
given at Lackland Air Force Base, near San Antonio.
Texas. that’s open to both men and women. You can
apply when you're within 210 days of graduation, or
after you've received your degree.

How long will I be committed to serve? Four years
from the time you graduate from OTS and receive
your commission. if you go on to pilot or navigator
training, the four years starts when you’re awarded

your wings.

Are there other ways to become an Air Force officer?
There's Air Force ROTC. active at many colleges
and universities, and the Air Force Academy, whcrc
admission is by examination and Congressional ap-
pointment. lf you'd like more information on any Air
Force program. you can get it from the Professor of
Aerospace Studies (if therc’s one on your campus) or
from an Air Force recruiter.
