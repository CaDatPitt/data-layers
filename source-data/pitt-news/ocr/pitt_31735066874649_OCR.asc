Revival of Student Humor Magaine

Results of the Student Congress poll on student opinion
with regard to revival of a humor magazine at Pitt show a
strong majority of those polled in favor of the move.

One thousand two hundred and sixty-two people were
asked,- “Would you look favorably upon a revival of a humor
magazine here at Pitt and would you support such a move?”
971 studentanswered yes while 291 took a negative stand.

According to Student Council:

President Emil Herman, the new
magazine would not be edited in
the same manner which the old
Panther was. “It would be pri-
marily concerned with maintain-
ing a high standard of quality,
both in writing and in make-up.”

A number of students /were re-
questedcto state their views on the
question{'Bob Dickinson, Engr. ’55,
and president of ODK stated, “The
University’s interests _can be
served well by afproperly run
student magazine. It should be

‘representative of Pitt life and be

representativ‘e of the type of pub-
lication that should come from a
university. With the above in.
mind, I strongly urge the estab-
lishment ofsuch a magazine.”

D Don Kettering, Col. "56, and IF
president stated, “I believe there

his a place in the University for a

humor magazine of good taste.
Care and discretion should be used
in the selection‘ of the editorial
staff and the publishing of a
humor magazine.”

Ken Hixenbaugh,_ Col. ’57,
stated, “I think that Pitt shuld
definitely have a humor mag-
azine again. However, if we are
to have it, it must be worthy of
bearing the University’s support.
We all, I’m sure, wantla magazine.
that is humorous but we also want
a type of humor that we will not
be ashamed of.,I am sure we are

quite capable of doing this if the‘

right people are chosen, to put this
magazine out and if the whole
student body gets, behind them
and keeps behind them.”

Congress submitted no state-
ments against the revival of a
student magazine. Of these seniors
polled, 263 voted for the proposal,
75 against. The junior class voted
222 for, a-nd 83 against. Sopho-
mores voted 206 for the proposal
and 40 against while the freshmen
voted 180 to 93 in favor of a stu-
dent magazine.

Party System 9

Men’s Council
Discusses Pros,
Cons of System C

By JACK OLENDER

As a result of Wednesday night’s
open session of Men’s Council, a
proposal for the establishment of
recognized political parties for
men has been submitted to the
Student Election Committee.
~ Don‘ Gartner and his Men’s
Council Committee, composed of
John Lynch, Nick Sirianni, and
Harold Shapiro, have attempted
to fulfill the following objectives:

To provide educational political
experience, to stimulate student
interest in student .government,
and to establish acceptable stand-
ards of operation. ‘

General Regulations

According to Men’s Council
proposals, the formal party or-
ganization will exist only during
the spring semester, beginning this
spring if possible. Party recogni-
tion will be based on a submitted
petition of at least 20 full time
students. Parties must maintain
the required membership in ord r
to have their slate accepted. 1:0
limit has been placed on the num-
-ber I of parties‘ which may exist,
and individuals may run inde-.
pendent of party organizations.

Development and Organization

All parties shall formally or-
ganize and be recognized by the
Student Election Committee after
the beginning of Spring Semester

and at least six weeks prior- to the"

scheduled election.

According to the proposal,
petitions will be available be-
ginning the first week of the
spring -semester. Each person
who signs a petition will pay a
membership fee of 25 cents.
These membership fees shall be
used to cover campaign ex-

ner’s committee originally pro-
posed‘this point, the Dean of Men’s
Office would be instrumental in
establishing parties.

Joe Trattner pointed out sev-
eral disadvantages to Gartner’s
proposal. He stated that results
of party slates could not be kept
secret,’ that the Dean of Men’s
Office would be doing much of
the work which the students
should be doing themselves, and
that the Dean’s advisor to the
party would actually be making
many of the policy decisions
which party members them-
selves should make. ’

As a result of Trattner’s sugges-
tions, the Dean’s office will merely
exert a regulating influence on the
activities of the various parties.

Basis Debated
A debate arose over the point
that, “All candidates slated or not
must petition for the respective

positions on an individual basis.”
Opponents to this proposal I felt
‘that this was not consistent with
he idea behind political partiesin
that candidates would be running
on a personal basis rather than
as a member of a coordinated unit.
The motion was passed as origin-
ally stated, over opposition.
Political parties as proposed
by Men’s Council will be tem-
porary organizations. They will
exist for one semester only and
then be dissolved along with the
disbanding of the physical or-
ganization. It is hoped that all
allegiances will also be forgot-
ten.

Bo Wilkins, MC president, ex-
pressed that “some parties would
want ‘to dissolve, therefore all
parties should be dissolved so that
none would be placed in an un-
fairly strong position. *

The proposals present a depart-

Wood Assisted Ry Large .. Staff
In Operation of  Station”

   

Paid Employees
Number Only 27

Rest Volunteers

By JOHN DeNINNO
(Second of ‘I1 Series)

William A. Wood, general
manager of Pittsburgh’s edu-
cational television s t a t i o n
WQED has a large and capa-
ble staff to aid him in the
operation of this unique station.

Mrs. Dorothy Daniels, who
headed the station from its out-
set, recently’ resigned her position
and is now on the station’s Bbard
of Directors. This Board is headed
by Leland Hazard.

under Wood, only 27 are paid
employees. The rest are volun-
teers. Pitt’s cooperation in the
development of WQED again
comes to light here in that a
large number of the‘ volunteers
are Pitt students or ‘faculty
members. - ,

These people work in many de-
partments of the station. Some of
which are the program director,
chief engineer, and the public re-“
lations departments.

Ziegler Program Director

John Ziegler has recently been
appointed to the. position of pro-
gram director. According -to
Ziegler he is a “trouble shooter”
for WQED as far as pro-
graming is concerned. Sched-
uling air time and dates for all
programs is just one of his many
duties. In doing this he must con-
cern‘himse1f with the audience he
is trying to reach. For example,
when would be the best time to
send a program over the air aimed
at the housewife? for the children?
for high school students?

He must try. to’ avoid airing
good education-al programs at the
same time that popular network
shows are being aired, since he

made available to the station at re-
duced rates. Scheduling must be
done-three months in advance, ac-
cording to Ziegler. ,
Dedicated to Public

Unlike commercial TV stations,
the Federal Communications Com-
mission does not require that the
station have public service time
since educational TV. is actually
dedicated to public service.

WQED’s Chief Engineer, Ed-
ward Horstman, is responsible
for the maintainance and smooth
operation of the station’s equip-
ment. In other words technical
problems at the station are Horst-
man’s problems.

To again point out the work
done by volunteers at WQED,
Horstman mentioned the fol-

Mademoiselle’s
Fiction Contest

lowing: a minimum of seven
engineers are needed for each
live show; the station has only
two paid engineers-—-Horstman
and an/assistant, therefore the’
rest must be volunteers. 1
WQED’s publicity office‘ is
headed -by Harriet Ackerman, Pitt
’45. This office releases informa-
tion concerning the station to_ the
metropolitan and local papers
in theten-county area which it
serves. The Volunteer Bureau
which is connected with the Pub-
lic Relations department will be
‘discussed in a future article.

Panther     Features ,

‘Page one of this issue contains the results of the first

poll conducted to determine student reaction to ‘revival of

a student magazine here, at Pitt. The--majority of those

, polled seemed ‘to hold the impression that the magazine
~ would be a strict humor magazine along thelines‘ of the
g old Panther but on a higher plane of humor. , ‘

This is true, but only in part. The magazine will cer-

tainly contain’ representative humor from within the Uni-

‘versity. Even more important, however, is the fact that the
reestablishment of such a magazine will result in a publi-
cation which can, devote a great deal of space to feature
storieswhichrcannot behandled in the Pitt News.

Such features might center onmen such.as Oliver Leslie
Reiser, professor of philosophy at Pitt, who has written
ten books since 1928. Each of the booksis worthy of a re-
view and certainly Professor Reiser merits a much longer

story than could be contained within thelimited columns  V

of the News.

A detailed story on Robert Arthur, director of .Pitt’s_

Varsity Marching Band, is long overdue. Little enough has
been written about this man. who is responsible for Pitt’s
having one of the best bands in the nation.

Dr. J ames"T. Liu, associate professor of history, is recog-
nized as one of the outstanding authorities on the subject
of Far Eastern Studies, a little known fact among students
at Pitt. , ~ '

If a student magazine existed today, a complete story
could be done on Chancellor Fitzgerald on the occasionof
his retirement from the University. ~

I - The list could go on indefinitely and should ‘reason
enough for reinstating a student magazine. '

Confusion and Horse Sense

. §y Irv Ro1'lI'mon,
Most of the"politicians- here, a few impartial
students, and anxious administration are all thor-

I oughly confused about political parties. I’m sure I

—can’t clarify anything
fusion. _ ,
One of the main objectives of election slates is to
stir up interest in voting.,lTo, stir up interest in’
anything around here is a main
objective. (Even movie goers .
have shown apathy to the out I

so I’ll just add to the con-

 

ciety selections being offered .
through the Congress of Scholas
tic Organizations.)

In the process of solving the 
Situation, solons feel that some 
_ N issues’ and projects 
might be introduced to beneﬁt iii ,
students as a whole. Others feel that parties will
beneﬁt a whole lot of students, instead; A more
original group feel that we must be realistic and
play up to the inherent political ambitions of “Sam
Stlident.”

Optimistic and Considerofe

Now‘Men’s Council, which has introduced the
idea of political parties, recently ‘completed a list
of regulations for -the implementation of the pro-
gram. Optimistically, solons have placed no limit
on the-number of parties that can exist. I

Considerately, they permit students to run in-
dependently of any party organization. Realisti-

   

S 03113’, they’ve decided to charge all joining mem-

\

bers .25 cents for”election costs. Unfortunately no
deﬁnite provisions have been set up for creating
platforms. ,

Students who want to join parties will be forced
to make their choice‘ purely on; a personality basis,
at the present time. I think that is one of the is-
sues with which party antagonists are concerned. ‘I
join them with my own doubts about the value
"of the present set up. ” '
Why Organize? ..

By the. spring semester, or at least, six weeks
prior to the scheduled election, all parties will be

formally organized. Party organizers (persons in-

A terested in forming parties, I suppose) will then

distribute membership cards at 25. cents a ducat.
Then members will hold a meeting to elect officers
to serve as an executive committee. For what pur- ‘
pose, I’m not sure. Confused again.

‘Some. time during the formation of the parties
and selection of slates, issues will have to be chosen. M
No provisions or helpful hints have been estab-
lished by planners. ,

As I see it, party organizers might do well to
choose platforms and draw up a list of accomplish-
ments they hope to achieve before they recruit
members for their cause. Then they’ll have one.
Budd_yjSys1-em Discouroged _ —

In that way, students will join individual par-
ties for reasons more signiﬁcant than that their
buddies are joining.

But where does the MC proposal go now? MC
prexy Bob Wilkins wants it to be Sent tothe stu-
dent election committee for approval. But mem-
bers -of the committee include two delegates from
MC, SC, and WSGA. Would it be possible for
either WSGA or SC representatives to voice any
opinion without the backing of their respective
groups? I think not. Therefore it must be con-‘
sidered at formal meetings by those two govern-‘
ment systems. ’
A'Kingdom For a Horse

But what of elections for _SC representatives?
All students, both men and women, elect men and
women delegates. A How will politicians -attempt to,
resolve the obvious conﬂicts in party philosophy
between coed candidates and the heartier” sex?

And what happens if so votes downpolitical
parties? The story is told of the man who promised
the king to teach his horse " to ﬂy within a year.

‘ He agreed thatshould he fail, he would have hi
-head out off. -

When asked how he could accept such .a propo-
sal, the man replied, “Well, inside of a year, 'I,
may die, or the horse may die, or the king may
die. And who knows, maybe I will teach the horse
to ﬂy!”

I-’m I confused.

Pitt’ Scientitsts Working
At Alcoholic Research

Several Pitt scientists have been
working on the Pittsburgh Plan to

labration with Dr. Olson at the
labortories at St. Margaret’s Hos-
pital. .

' The Commonwealth of Penn-

sylvania has given the plan a

grant for $123,000. The plan will
have a physician study the medi-
cal phase; a psychiatric s oc i al
worker will work on the emotional
problems; and nutritionists . will
study the dietary factors. Alco-
holics Anonymous and the Alco-
holic Information Center will help

. on general matters.

Research is going on at the
University of Pittsburgh Schools

of Medicine and Public Health,

Falk Clinic, and St. Margaret’s
Hospital. The Pitt team hasn’t
found anything yet, but they have
started to come up with some im-
portant theories on alcoholism.

 to Take Over Compass;
Dean of Men Gives Approval

Dean of Men Theodore W. Biddle has approved a‘ pro-
posal by Men’s Council that MC take over supervision of the

Pitt Compass.

Under the new plan, Council will have control of the

Compass but the Dean of Men’s¢

office will pay for the handbook.

Walt Becker, MC’ publicity di-
rector, emphasized that although
no definite decisions have been
made, Council plans no radical
changes in the handbook. As in
the past, the Pubilcations Board
will have the final word on all
policies. ‘ i

The proposal said:

Council control would give the
Compass a connection with an
established campus group.

Men’s council, being, a’ repre-
sentative group, would better
know what men want. .
 Since MC is concerned with the

By*G‘ENE *AROMATORIO

With only three days since the
last rash of poor playing during
which they dropped their third
straight game, the Panther cagers
will take on powerful Penn State
at the,Field House tomorrow night
with the tipoff timed for 8:30.
Coach Bob Timmons gave his
prescription to the ailing Panthers
after the Syracuse loss when he
- said, “We’re going to have to work
like anything to get ready for
State.” V
' With the way things have
been going for the "Blue and
Gold hoopsters since the holi-
dayshthe Panthers wil have to
take on a completely new ap-
pearance, playing-wise, if they
hope to upset the Nitanies. 4
A check over the record shows
that the last Panther victory came
.atthe expense of the Plaidmen
from Carnegie Tech, almost two
weeks ‘ago. Since then the locals
have dropped. contests to Geneva,

_ Westminster, and Syracuse.

is the fact that the Timmonsmen
were at least slight favorites in
each game. Another odd twist is
added when fans cheek ov.er the
Panther wins and find them

knocking off such eastern powers
as Fordham, Colgate, NYU, and

with the smaller local colleges.
In the Lions, the Panther

hoopsters will be coming up ’

\ against a zone defense and, in all
probability, a full-court press at

times. The Lions use the press '

a good bit and will probably
employ it against the locals-—
especially since the Timmons_-
men were “lost” Tuesday night
trying to solve the Syracuse
press.

Another big worry for the Pan-
thers, in addition to the zone and
press, will be 6-5 Jesse Arnelle
who is currently splitting the
cords at a 26-point per game aver-
age. Arnelle, who shed his foot-
ball togs and donned the hoop
regalia only a few weeks ago,
appears well on his way to his
best year yet. A ,

The Panthers’ answer to Arn-
-elle will be Captain Ed Pavlick
who is tos-sing them in at the rate
of 22.8 points‘ a game. The 6-2
forward is also the leading re-
bounder with an averagevof more
than twelve per game to his
credit.

Not far behind Pavlick in the
rebound department are sopho-
mores John Riser and Bob Lazor
who are both pulling down better

than eleven per, contest.

“The whole movement is to re-

What with the Blue and Gold Ebe-

In their latest effort, Coach Lee-

the eight events—-—four by falls——to
capture the decision. The four

Hainilton Receives Nomination

For Jaycee Man-of-the-Year

Athletic Director Tom Hamilton has been nominated
for Pittsburgh’s annual Man-of-the-Year Award for his ac-

tivity in sports this year. ,

The Man-of—the-Year Award is given annually to the

living past Men-of-the-Year.
Hamilton has been Direct-or of
Athletics and Physical Education

1951 Hamilton was interim coach"
for t-he entire year when Len

over as head coach of Oregon.
Again this year Hamilton took
over the \ team when Coach Red
Dawson was hospitalized with a
heart condition. Probably the
Captain’s most notable achieve-
ment this year was Pitt’1s upset
win over Navy which later went
on to bowl over the University of
Mississippi in the'Sugar Bowl. '
The Man-of—the-Year, himself,
the individual who contributed
most to Pittsburgh’s progress in
1954, will be announced Friday,
Jan. 21. The dinner, however, is
scheduled for Monday, Jan. 31 in
the ballroom of the William Penn
Hotel. A
The Pittsburgh Junior Chamber

For F lrst Win

This evening win ﬁnd the
Panther sharpshooters at the
Stadium range in an attempt to
‘garner their first win in Greater
Pittsburgh Riﬂe League compe-
tition, at the expense of a rather
green Carnegie Tech‘ team. The
match, which will be» the second
for the Panthers, is slated_,to start
at 6 p.m.

Carnegie Tech, a strong team in
the league last year, has suffered
through graduation and is not ex.-
pected - to give Sgt. Gro\mko"S
riﬂers too tough a-’ test. The
Pittites, though, will be “gunning”
for .Tech in an attempt to regain

the prestige they lost in the ‘match

with -Duquesne.

,Unoff'icial league standings now
show West Viriginia leading with
a 1-0 record, followed by Du-
quesne with a 1-1 chart. The
Panthers, Washington and Jeffer-
son, and Carnegie Tech all have
0-1 xrecords. However,
Gromko believes that. with -the
likes of Tom Sheppard, who is
believed to be one of’ the finest

shots in the league, and David .

Jacob-son, his team will give an
excellent account of itself.

Plans have already been formu-
lated to include Indiana State
Teachers, Penn State, and Penn,
all of whom. are now completing
ranges, in the 1956 schedule. The
expanding of the Greater Pitts-
burgh League, to eight teams, is
expected to make for keener
competition as well as ea‘ longer‘
schedule.

The freshman team», has also
been active, although its matches‘
have been conﬁned to practice
shoots with the varsity. Inter-
collegiate matches for freshmen-,
‘will get underway‘ with me new‘
