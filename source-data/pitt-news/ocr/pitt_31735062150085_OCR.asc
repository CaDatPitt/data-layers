Staufﬁs Staff
Shows ‘Stuff’

A cover of Yuletide green featur-
ing two campus personalities and
the annual bag of candy distinguish
the Christmas Panther in its annual
appearance and gift to the campus.
The candy, pinned to the cover in
a cellophane sack, is undoubte.dly
meant’ to sweeten the already sweet
first issue under the regime of Jack
Stauﬁ",,vC42, new editor of the hu-
mor magazine.

“People,” a new feature, presents
pictures _and biographies of two
women and a man of the Univer-
sity—-two students and one faculty
member., “Osculation is an Art,”
the Panther declares as it reprints
an article from the Michigan Gar-
goyle. «

A revised format with more pic-
tures than ever is the Panther by-
word in this_month’s issue. Campus
scenes predominate, and the photog-
raphy is better than ever——even
Bill McElwain’s informal shots of
the iootball team on the way to
Duke.

The price remains at 15 cents,
with no extra charge for the candy.

The Last Chance .

tions and individuals when this

December 27 has been set as the
last day that students may submit
questions for public answers by
Chancellor John G. Bowman.

Until the deadline every student
is entitled to turn in questions to
the dean of men’s oiﬁce.

The chancellor will answer these
student—submitted questions during
a Student-Faculty .. association as-
sembly scheduled ior Friday, Jan-
uary l0, in Soldiers’ and Sailors’
Memorial hall. Students will gath-
er to hear the Chancellor’s discus-
sion of their questions during the
fourth hour if class dismissal. is

Questions may pertain to Uni-
versity adniinistration, student-fac-
ulty relationship, or any other sub-
ject connected with the University.
The number of questions submit-
ted by each student will not be
limited.

According to Joseph Roberts,
C41, president of SFA, questions
will be collected in the dean of
men’s oﬁice. The most important
and most interesting ones will be
chosen by the executive committee.
These will be listed and submitted
to Dr. Bowman for his considera-
tion.

The topic of discussion will be
published in the Pitt News on the
day of the assembly.

Education Series
Slated for Forum

Following Christmas vacation,
Pitt Town Meeting plans to stage a
series of meetings on education and
what it means to the student, an-
nounces Esther Marcuson, C41,
chairman. _

The first meeting, January 6, will
feature a faculty member who will
speak on the subject of general ed-
ucation, and the second, January
13, will take the form of a round-
table symposium in which members
of the faculty will_contribute their
views on the place of education in
the world today.

Further plans for Pitt Town
Meeting call for a monthly analysis
and review of world news. First
of these meetings is planned for late
January. Sometime in March a dis-
cussion on marriage will be given.

Feature IV:-iters Study People,
T ell Amazing Facts, Go Batty

At the University there is a class
in feature-writing. Feature writ-
ing is a type of writing in which
the man bites the dog. Also in fea-
ture—writing you ﬁnd out where the
man bit the dog.

Feature-writing is easy, we learn,
and there is money in it.

One good way to write a feature,
so we are told, is to watch a num-
ber of people and record how they
act. For example if 13 people
would jump from the thirteenth
ﬂoor of the Cathedral, a feature-
writer would write a story about
the number 13.

One me-‘njiber of the feature class

‘stood by a‘ pair of revolving doors

and watched the people who came

into the University. Here is what

he found:

FACT: Men enter by the right
door. Women by the left door.
FACT: Groups tend to follow the

leader.

FACT: A couple usually enters by
the same door:

FACT: The majority of students
push only hard enough that they
may get through. , Y»

extra hard whirl. Some, go

The new officers succeeded Rich-

insignia of rank in recognition of
their service.

Edward Tait, C42,‘ president of
Pitt Riﬂes, was appointed ﬁrst lieu-
tenant, battery executive, and John
Campbell, E43, ﬁrst lieutenant, bat-
tery adjutant.

Commissions as second lieuten-
ant, platoon leaders, were received
by Richard Stein, C43, Ralph W.

BA43.

Other ofﬁcers inducted were:
Alan Briney, C43, ﬁrst sergeant;

James Nixdorf, E43, supply ser-
geant; Frederick Rudolph, C43,
George Jones, E43, and Edward

Of Yule Scene 

The Cathedraliscene of Raymond
Alden’s story, ' “Why the Chimes
Rang,” will be portrayed by'mem-
bers of the Heinz chapel choir, the
Women’s Dance club, and the.Pitt
Players in the Commons Room‘ to-
day at 1:45 o’clock.

According «to the story, in ,a
colossal cathedral with tall stone
columns an.d a grand entrance hung
the most wonderful chiming bells
in the world. It was the custom‘ on
Christmas eve for all the people to
bring their offerings to the Christ-
Child, and when the greatest offer-
ing was laid on the altar, the
chimes would ring far up in the
tower.

The program will open with an
organ prelude by Russell Wich-
mann, University organist. The
choir will then sing “Lo, what"-a
Beauteous Rose.” Leo Harter, C42,
the narrator, will begin the story of

by “Acleste Fidelis.”
The story of little brother in the

cathedral will next be presented
with Pitt Players pantomiming
the parts. Betty Brunk, Ed4l., is

cast as the queen; John Glasson,
E42, will play the part of the king;

During the play members of the
Women’s dance club will give in-

The rendition of three Christmas
songs by the choir will -complete
the program. They are: Bach’s
“Good News from Heaven,” “Angels
We Have Heard on High,” and
“Jesus, Joy of Man’s Desiring.” The
entire congregation is invited to
join with the choir in singing the
ﬁnal hymns, “Joy to the World”

An {Ipen Lonel-

To Ffltlllélél‘ Time
Dear Pa:

We have just been thinking the year over—ﬁgur—
ing out what we boys on the News have been hollering
about and what has been accomplished at the Univer-
sity this year.

Nothing sensational has screamed across our pages,
but there’s been lots of little things which some of us
think are important. For instance:

Hospitalization

This was our first campaign. We started it in May
two weeks after we took over the 1039913 D99 Cargo;
and the Health service co-sponsored the drive whic
but there’ve been lots of little things which some of us
us think are important. For instance:

When our campaign ended on the last of ‘October,
over 600 students had signed up. We were satisﬁed.

Forums

“We recommend that such loosely coordinated or-
ganizations as Inquiry forum,_ 1V_1en’5 Debatmg 355°C“
ation, Women’s Speech association, International Re-
lations club, and Peace coiincil get together and de-
velop a ﬁrst rate program. So read our edit page on
Monday, September 23.

The next day a special meeting was called from
which resulted the Pitt Town Meeting, the most suc-
cessful forum series at Pitt for a long time. Most of
these organizations are working with the committee,
all except Peace council. It seems there is no such
group anymore. They say only ﬁfth columnists belong
to them.

S po rts

Just before the opening game last fall, we said that
the new football policy would receive an honest test
this year.

It sure. did.

Board of Deans

The Board of Trustees recommended that the chan-
cellor convene with the deans periodically and_frequent-
ly as a cabinet for the expression of their advice on ad-
ministrative policies and procedures and to inform them
about the University’s current affairs.

The deans now meet the ﬁrst Monday of every
month.

Faculty Council

The Board of Trustees recommended the establish-
ment of a University Council as representatives of the
faculty, to be convened periodically and fzequently _by
the chancellor, or his representatives for the expression
of the faculty’s advice on educational policies and ‘pro-
cedures and to inform the faculty about the Univer-
,sity’s current affairs.

“Faculty, Deans Organize New Council”—-Six col-
umn streamer, Monday, March 11.

SFA

Last year’s SFA president made a report.
merited thusly:

“The Cusick report shows not only a need for more
new projects but also a tightening of old functions.
The building and grounds committee of this year found
no substitute for the practice of eating on the eighth
floor steps—-we do not know whether or not they even
investigated this; the social committee has not solved
the riddle of inexpertsive evening dances at Pitt; the
statistics committee report speaks for its own condem-
nation—-taking but one poll the entire year; and the
perennial problem facing every big name dance chair-
man—that of making his dance break evcn——still has
to bemet, especially after this year when three out of
the four SFA darce ‘chairmen ended up in the red.

“The point we make is that an organization blessed
with so much leeway as the combined Student-Faculty
assembly can do much more for the average student
at Pitt than mere routine functions.”

A few weeks ago we asked for some constitutional
revision of the group, especially in the election of offi-
cers.

The main trouble with this year’s SFA is that it is
still an honorary activities fraternity, not a student
legislature.

We com-

Parlcing Facilities

In the spring the PAA and the Syria Mosque fellas
and the Masons who own all the property facing the
Fifth avenue side of the Cathedral put the kibosh on
student parking by petitioning the Better Traffic com-
mittee, hiring a special cop to tag student cars.

The company policeman hasn’t made an appearance
so far this semester.

Alumni Representation

The old grads say that the school is gyping them
out of a couple of places on the Board of Trustees. They
clam they rate about thirteen seats, “just like Governor
Earle said.” The other boys wail that the alums are
wanting three seats in addition to ten alumni positions
wi«.icl'i nave expired; that although there are thirteen
vacancies, the alumni‘ is only eligible to fill ten.

The mix-up is further complicated. It seems that
the alumni, gifted only with the power of nomination,
will only present thirteen candidates for thirteen jobs
which makes their nomination tantamount to election.
The big boys say that this isn’t playing the game square.

You’re right. We don’t understand it.

Eating Facilities

Major complaints: Eating on the eighth ﬂoor steps;
smallness and smokiness of the Kathedral Kitchenette;
monopolization of booths there by card-playing frater-
nity women.

A new Tuck shop, spreading over the entire north-
eastern quarter of the ground floor, isnow under con-
struction. ,

A Student Literary Magazine

“Pitt _Needs a Literary Mag”—Editorial, May 21,
1940. “Literary Faces Blush as Pitt Meets Rhocle
Island”—Editorial, December 9, 1940. .

We now hear that the University publications board
is investigating printing costs for such a magazine.

Freedom of the Student Press

“The way to conduct an impartial newspaper, we
believe, is not by silly pretense of having each of our
writers report his opinions in an objective manner.
Impartiality can be achieved by allowing each side
toipresent its own prejudiced viewpoint. Prejudice
canbe a great thing, and lack of it can signify noth-
ing but absence of opinion.

,f“As long as the_Pitt News is a student newspaper,
its pages will be open to discussions of oﬁ and on
campus happenings by editorial writers, columnists,
and those non—sta1°f members who have something to
say.”

The Pitt News is still a student newspaper.
don’t believe us, ask Father Kirk.

Atlases Trace
up Changes
User 400 Years

Eighth-grade geography may be
at a stand-still. Daily newspapers
may include a new map of Europe
with every headline. But Europe

is not the first continent to change
its face, according to over 100 old
atlases in the Darlington Memorial
library’s collection of Americana.

Within the worn leather, of six-
teenth-century bindings are maps
whose colors and symbols prove
that the world once neither knew
nor cared much about our familiar
outlines of North America. In the
atlases of men such as Simon Gyr-
naeus and Abraham Ortelius, it is
possible to trace the cartography of
our continent through 400 years and
to note the growth of European in-
terest in the New World.

As early as 1532, the coast line of
Latin America was accurately por-
trayed, the atlases in the library
show. North America was, how-
ever, regarded as “a narrow strip
of land,” and is represented as one
of the few islands that ﬂoat about
in the “oceanus magnus.”

The term “America” first appear-
ed about 1573, when the Flemish
cartograp-her, Ortelius, presented
seven maps that put the seas where
they belong and portrayed our
country in continental shape.

In 1606, although quaint ships
and fantastic sea lions still inhabi-
ted the Chesapeake Bay and the
“Virginian Sea,” the variety of trees
and animals drawn on a new world
map by Captain John Smith indi-
cated topography, climate, and pos-
sibilities for exploration in this new
land.

With the colonization period, In-
dian and English place names, such
as Jamestown and Pasaughtocock,
appeared on the same maps, as the
natives and colonists began to make
history side by side.

These early maps served their
purpose by inspiring later carto-
graphers to interest themselves in
the new world, and paved the way
for the more nearly perfect maps of
North America which were to fol-
low.

Seventh Floor Displays

Christmas Print Exhibit

In keeping with the Yuletide
spirit, an exhibit of colored prints
of madonnas and nativities, and
subjects pertaining to the Christmas
season will be exhibited in the
fine arts gallery on the seventh
floor starting Friday.

The prints are from the German,
ltaliaii, Dutch, and Flemish schools.

This Should Teach Virginia
Not to IVrite to Editors

Dear Virginia:

I’m sorry I couldn’t write sooner.

You’ve probably read about how

all the children write letters to Santa Claus without stamps on them
and they get turned into the post-ofﬁce and some kindold‘ gentleman
comes along and takes care of them. Well, it’s all the bunk. We wrote

about four hundred of them and
all we got was a bill for twelve

dollars from the post—oﬁ‘ice depart-
ment.

0 Harman Blows Bubbles

Up here in the News office we
have a tree every year. Silver pa-
per from marijuana packets makes
the best tinsel. Dick Harman
comes up and -blows bubbles, then
we paint them and use them for
bulbs. Someone forgot to turn
Dick oﬁ the other day and we had
to swim back to our desk. Our
editor has a ﬁve-pointed nose, so
we just wait till New Year’s eve and
hang him up on top of the tree. It
is very lovely and lends an atmos-
phere to the room.

We are mad at the Panther, so
they don’t get any presents from us.
It all started when we were ﬁght-
ing about who Will Sheris should
write for. We had a big, price war
and kept raising each other. Final-

ly, the Panther bid forty dollars
and we had to take Sheris. We got
even though. The Panther wound
up with Stauff and we gave Sheris
and twenty dollars to the Owl for
six sheets of copy paper on a 99-
year lease.

0 Morals & Morale

And listen, Virginia, if you want
a real Merry Christmas, you just
march yourself right down to the
Tuck shop. I haven’t been there
recently, but they tell me all the

Eei ters to the

Eclitor, the Pitt News:

In Monday’s issue of the News
there appeared a very biased article
on me ASCAP—BlV.[I feud. As you
have presented this controversy
from the ASCAP side, I feel the
same should be done ior the radio.

ASCAP is an organization of
about 1,000 song writers and num-
erous publishers. Its principal
source oi income is radio which
pays 5 per cent of its gross income
or about $5,000,000 this year. Only
about 30 per cent of this goes to
the songwriters, the rest to the
publishers and the society ofﬁcers.

The 5 per cent contract expires
January 1, 1941.

Next year ASCAP is demanding
$9,000,000, almost twice what is
now being paid. Since the radio
stations can’t or won’t pay such a
high price, they organized BMI to
supply them with music when and
if ASCAP refuses to let its songs
be broadcast.

BMI will publish anybody’s song;
in fact, they are begging people to
write for them. ASCAP, on the
other hand, is a closed organization,
for (1) a person must have five
songs published in order to become
a member, and (2) publishers will

only publish works of ASCAP
members. .
ASCAP controls some 300,000

song titles; BMI, by buying the
rights to independent publishers’
songs and to new songs has about

Editor . . . Asciitv  BMI  

240,000 titles. In any event there
will be plenty of music.

Your article speaks of BMI as a
monopoly. On January 1 when
ACSAP yanks its songs from the
air, non-ASCAP songs will include
BMI, independent, and public do-
main tunes. BMI is not a monop-
oly; ASCAP is. The federal gov-
€*1‘l'].l‘i’1€l‘ll', is investigating ASCAP,
riot BMI, on anti—trust charges.

Since December 1, CBS sustain-
ing programs have not used ASCAP
songs. The quality has been very
good for old accepted classics, and
other well—known songs are much
better than the latest “hits” of Tin
Pan alley.

Incidentally, number one on the
Hit Parade is “There I Go,” a BMI
song. -

CLARENCE TYLER, E42.

(Editor’s note: We’re biased all
right. And so w-e’d like to submit
some of our own figures and facts
to the attention of anybody who has
nothing to do all day but listen to
the radio. As reported in Friday
magazine, December 6, ASCAP is a
non-proﬁt organization for collect-
ing royalties for a membership of
1,146 composers and authors and
139 music publishers. PM, Decem-
ber 15, says membership counts
1,500 American composers or their
estates and over 300 publishers, rep-

resenting 40,000 more composers,
past and present. The big radio
stations that want to discontinue
paying ASCAP rake in $130,000,000
annually, says PM; last year ASCAP
collected $4,200,000 in royalties for
its members. This makes 3 per cent
by our slide rule; Friday says 3.4
per cent. The Pittsburgh Press,
December 16, says 70 per cent of
radio operation is music; PM says 60
per cent music is average of big
networks. ASCAP controls 2,000,000
songs, says the Press; PM estimates
it at 1,500,000; Friday says they
control 300,000. If we called BMI a
monopoly, we were mistaken; it’s a
puppet. The one half of the radio
stations and the big networks, which
take in over 80 per cent of thereve-
nue, control BMI. PM says NBC
will go non-ASCAP December 23,
that NBC sustaining programs are
already BMI, that CBS and MBS
sustainers went on strict diet De-
cember 15. The only reason we
bothered about all this was because
we thought that since it’s the public
who pays for radio music-—-advertis-
ing costs come right out of the con-
sumer’s pocket—the public ought to
be the one to say which songs it
wants to hear. 1941 will be rung
in to BMI tunes. No cacophony al-
lowed.)

They Had a

little we-gettum-you-datem bureau at the camp. It

the bureau, which was located underneath
a battery of 10-inch disappearing riﬂes,
say your name and Miss I-know—the-love-
liest-girl signed you up. ’ There were gen.-
erally three accepted systems for getting
results at the we-gettum-you-datem bu-
reau. One was to play up to Miss Wats_
ername: lay it on thick and you get a 1.‘
honey. Number two was just be casual! ﬂip her your
name; say “You know——-medium, brown eyes, brunette”
Number three system was to just skip the bureau and
go stag. The last mentioned was the predominantly
favored system after the first week. '

Number one usually produced a bag of bones with
stringy hair, and jutting clavicles; number two, gen-
erally evoked one of those prim bims with a southern
accent that drooled all over and over. The girls in these
first two groups were all prerated as nice personality

ﬂoor they cut in and out like Pittsburgh traffic “That’s
the way We do it down heah, suh!” they’d'say and
whamo you joined the stag line. But the stag line had
its bad points. ‘There was always the guy who got a
drip, and he’l keep coming around “Dyawanna meet
mah date?” And if you think he was just giving you
a break———0h you poor innocent reader.

The dancing was mainly of two kinds: the pum -
handle variety and the skaweeze-me type. On all fapst
numbers YOU got the pump handle—up and down
pump, pump. I believe one reason for this was that
the ore“ cstra was made up of regular army men who
played in the post band——-the Military

got the skaweeze-me which consists of
a boy and a girl and——see cut. '

With Bill McElwain
Sports Editor

Dr. H. Clifford Carlson’s latest basketball system, as interpreted
by his latest basketball squad, makes its debut at Madison, Wiscon-
sin, tonight. Then, in rapid succession, the Panthers go bounding
about the Middle Vi/est playing Illinois, Northwestern, Butler, Ohio
State, and Michigan.

On the surface it might seem that we should be mourning the
loss of such a splendid source of news, for with Christmas vacation
intervening, no further word of the Continuity Cuties will be printed
in the Pitt. News until early in January.

But the apparent drawback has its good points. Should the
good doctor’s new brainstorm turn out as efficient‘ as his last two
or three, and should the l’anthers’ jaunt through the Big Ten be

as successful as in recent years, there will be reason for everyone-

concerned to keep the whole matter strictly quiet.

They’re—In a,Rut

As a basketball power, the Panthers just haven ’t been there the
past three years. In 1937-38 the Doctor relied on an all-senior beef
trust which almost wrecked its opponents physically, but ﬁnished
second best in scoring entirely too often. The next yearlhe shifted
to sophomores, who played in the best sophomore tradition and
won slightly more than half their games with a disturbing display
of inconsistency. Last year the sophomores became juniors; they

celebrated with a l.osing season.

'l‘he,l)oetor has another all-senior team this winter, but‘ they ’re
in better physical shape than the 1938 piano movers, and they have

several lively substitutes pushing them.

Should they catch on to

Jarlson-’s ‘;fBusy Bee” offense, whatever that may be, they may go

places.

Fla.she's of brilliance last season‘ portend better things ahead;

they havefpotential greatness ‘combined with experience. H
be, although frankly we don’t intend to place any sizeable bets on

It may

it, that this is the year when “‘Win iem all” will become more than
just a.-slogan. t After all, you can it go on saying something like that
to basketball teams year after‘ year without one of them ﬁnally

getting the-; idea.
Jobs or a ‘Vacation

Everyone is quite excited about‘ the promise made by the
oﬂicials of Stanford. and Nebraska universities to compensate those

menibers.of—their football squads who might have had jobs "during
Christmasvacation but who instead will play in the Rose Bowl..
The two schools defend the move, and claim that in each case
a thoroughinvestigation will be conducted before the boy will be
paid. sO’n_ly.those who can prove that they deﬁnitely would other-
wise have worked and that they need‘ work will receive payment.
Some cri.ti.cs of the plan have said that this might lead to the
necessity of providing similar payments during spring training
periods. Others have come out and hooted, “Professionalism!”

The first group of critics is guilty of illogical thinking.

Spring

training is included in the regular football programs of both sch.ool.s,
andthe boys who play know it. Rose Bowl games are not a regular
part of anyone football programs. Vile can see no relation be-

tween the two.

VVe dismiss the second group by suggesting that the whole Rose

Bowl setup is a purely professional, comniercial business.

JA.l.S0,

while some of the boys will be sa.t-isﬁed with a ﬁne vacation trip,

others need‘ job money badly.

If the investigationto determine.
need is conducted sincerely, there should be no causefor co1npl.ain.t. .

“Read ’em._.and weep”—the cap-

ofrthe final. and total ﬁgures of the
year. 1 ' .
Only Fordham and Duke outsta-

to stop the Pitt team on the one-
yard line to win. Yet the won-lost
record shows a Blue and Gold elev-
en on the down side of the .500 mark .

Despite this mediocre won and

cided edge on their opponents" in ‘

every department except passing.
In total yards gained the Pitt squad
compiled a total of 1,764 yards as
against the combined efforts of the
opposition‘ of. 1,605 yards.

On the ground the Bowser-coach-
ed machine was far superior to the
eight opponents, showing a total
gain of 1,719 yards against 1,261,
and a net gain of 1,434 against
1,029. Only in passing did enemy
elevens surpass the Pittites, collect-
ing 576 yards on 48 completions out
of 112 tries against 20 completions
out of 70 attempts for 330 yards.
Stetlcr’s Mark. Best

Individually the sophomore skit-
terbug, Jack Stetler, was Pitt’s most
potent offensive weapon. The swiv-
el-hipped yearling averaged 7.3
yards every time he got his hands
on the ball including 326 yards in
46’ attempts rushing, kick-off and
punt returns, intercepted passes,
passes received, and passes thrown.
The elusive Stetler also turned in

Five Swiminers

~Attend Forum

Led by swimming coach Ben
Grady, ﬁve members of the Panther
swimming team will board a train
late this week and head for Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, to attend the
annual aquatic forum held there.
Accompanying Grady will be Gus
and Ralph Wilde, Vety Shulness,
Bill Mccafferty and Bill Reese.

The local natators will endeavor
to pick up some valuable pointers
from the talks on swimming and
diving‘ techniques given by the
coaches of the various universities
represented. After the talks by the
coaches, student swimmers will take
part in discussions on the tech-
niques pointed out.

A feature of the forum will be
the swimming meet between a team
from the eastern schools and a
team representing the western uni-
versities. Last year the eastern
squad was coached by Grady, and
held the West to the closest score
in the meet’s history. The West
won, 102-85.

ﬁve experienced Pitt cagers enter
the fray against a strong Wiscon-
sin university aggregation tonight
for the opening tilt of a rugged
four-game mid-western jaunt.

Conquerors of Notre Dame in a
torrid 44-43 struggle last Saturday,
the Badgers play host to the Pan-
thers with a formidable array of
basketball talent. Coach H. C. Carl-
son’s ten-man squad must blow
hot from the beginning this year to

keep out of the doldrums that .

plagued the local basketeers half
of last year’s consistently inconsist-
ent campaign.
Veteran Cast

Brilliant Eddie Straloski, indi-
vidual high scorer in both his soph-
omore and junior years and holder
of the Pitt individual scoring record
of 32 points, leads his teammates
into the battle at forward tonight.
And his supporting cast of two
years standing, redheaded Mel Port,
George Kocheran, Sam Milane-
vich, and Jimmy Klein, carry Pitt
hopes lor the ﬁrst good season in
four years. ,

An inexperienced, but ﬁghting,
reserve ﬁve boasts enough talent to
give the starting outfit plenty of
rest and may be a large factor in
the outcome of the struggle at Mad-
ison tonight. Outstanding member
of this outﬁt is junior Larry Palf-
rath, out of school last year, who
showed ﬂashes of greatness two
seasons ago. Junior Lefty Ziolkow-
ski ﬁgures to see much action along
with the rest of the members of
the traveling squad, sophomores
’l‘ay‘l\/lalarkey, John Swacus and
Eddie Masten.

After tonight’s clash, the Carl-

SAM MILANOVICH
third ti'me’s the charm

son-coached troup goes to Cham-
paign, Ill., where they share court
with the Illini basketeers. Captain
Johnny Drish and Bob Richmond.

Sammies, Phi Eps Lead  
In Two lVlinor . Sports 

Coming down the home stretch in
IF badminton and paddle tennis
-competition, Sigma Alpha Mu and
Phi Epsilon Pi have taken com-
manding leads to virtually clinch
cup places in their respective sports.

Badminton, played for the first
time this year in the intramural
program, has the closest race with
six teams still in the running.

Sigma Alpha Mu, beaten only by
the third place Phi Kaps, has set
a terriﬁc pace with an average of
.916. Henry Nemrod and “Sappy”
Sapplsky handle all the badminton
duties for the Sammies.

Phi Kaps Slip

In second place with an honora-
ble .857 average Phi Epsilon Pi
stillstands an excellent chance of
overtaking the leaders for they have
four remaining games as compared

, with the Sammies’ three. Charles

Cuden ‘and Cuddy.Briskin form the
duct of Phi Ep racket wielders.

Close behind are the Phi Kappa
and Pi Lambda Phi teams. Phi
Kappa pulled an upset when they
defeated - a» highly favorite SAM
team, but have since beenon the
downgrade.

Pi Lambda Phi, in a challenging
fourth place position, has seven
games left to play, and should gain
in the cup race. Marty Faberman
have been
standout performers for the Pilam

A team.

Phi Delts Second

Leading the paddle tennis teams
in ‘the quest for the championship
is the undefeated Phi Epsilon Pi
team. Sporting an enviable mark
of 15 victories against no defeats,
the Phi Eps should breeze through
their remaining games. Wally
Hirscli and Jimmy Deutelbaum are
the paddle tennis players from the
Neville street house.

In the second place with 13 victo-
ries against two defeats is the ﬁght-
ing Phi Delt combination. The Phi
Delts boast two standouts, Bob
Black and Jim Smith.

B y ‘Colonels’

It may have been just a rumor
about Fletcher Hodges Jr., curator
of the Foster hall collection, being
a Kentucky colonel, but Dr. John
W. Oliver, professor and head of
th history department, was recent-
ly commissioned to the honorable
Order of Kentucky Colonels.

The Order of Kentucky Colonels
purchased Howard Chandler Chris-
ty’s painting of Stephen Foster and
conferred the title upon the com-
poser last July and upon Dr. Oliver
this month.

In accordance with Kentucky tra-
dition, Foster wrote one of his
most famous melodies, “My Old
Kentucky Home,” while visiting in
Dr. Oliver received
the commission because of his aid
in bringing the Foster collection
from Indianapolis, Ind., to Pitts-
burgh; and his placing of Foster's

" name on the ballot of the American

Hall of Fame.

YW Ends Successful
Christmas Card Sale

Christmas card season has come
and gone, as far as the YWCA is
_ concerned, and a Very large season
it was, too. Last year they started
‘to sell University Christmas cards.
They had one scene-——the Heinz
Chapel in a snow—storm. They did
a terriﬁc business——4,000 cards.
‘This year the YWCA had two
scenes——the Chapel and a View of
the Cathedral.

tiating Ken Wilson, Francis Mafﬁe,
John McCoy, and George Risko. Not
being satisﬁed with a night of ini-

held on present-day business.

Graham Helps Texan

Collect Prize Money

Boyd Sinclair, editorr-in-cliief of
the Daily Texan, University of
Texas newspaper, read in a. Tex-
as paper that he had won second
prize in the editorial writing con-
test sponsored by Pi Delta Epsilon,
national honorary journalism fra-

t ternity,

V Time-passed" and no money was
forthcoming. Christmas was com-
ing and funds were low. So Sin-
clair, in desperation, wrote a letter
to Pi Delta Epsilon, addressing it
to Pittsburgh.

After traveling the rounds of
Greek restaurants and the city’s
educational institutions, the letter
was delivered to R. X. Graham,
director of the University News
service and member of Pi Delta
Epsilon. But Mr. Graham didn’t
know there was a contest and for
a good 15 minutes couldn’t think
of the names of any of the nation-
al oﬁcers. He finally decided that
Dale Gramley, journalism profes-
sor at Lehigh university, Bethle-
hem, Pa., would do, so the letter
was forwarded.

Perhaps now Sinclair will get a

9 Christmas present from Bethle-

hem.

Hyman Cohen, E43, took. in the
greatest amount of money, $26.
Kitty Lou Haughton, C43, led the

Carlson Predicts
‘lilo-lessi Recess

The current ﬂu epidemic which
seems to be making a general sweep
of the nation probably will not have
much effect on the University,
prophesies Dr. H. C. Carlson, head
of the Men’s Health service.

As in the past, the University will
probably be spared an epidemic be-
cause there is no dormitory system
in operation on campus. The spread
of the disease is thus checked ‘by
the lack of intimate contact which
was the case in those schools now
affected by the epidemic, according
to Dr. Carlson.

Dr. Carlson has issued a warn-
ing to take care of even the slight-
est colds and to get as much rest
as possible over the holidays. He

also stated that an extremely light
New Year’s eve would benefit all.
