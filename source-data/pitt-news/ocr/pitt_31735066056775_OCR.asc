CM Ufemale raped in Schenley Par/e

By John Temple
Staff Writer

Three men forced a female
Carnegie Mellon student into
the Flagstaff Hill woods a
week ago, where two of
them raped her by knife-
point. .

The men attacked the vic-
tim as she was walking alone
on Frew Street, which bor-
ders the CMU campus and
Schenley Park, at 1:40 a.rn.
Sunday, Jan. 24, according to
the university’s Department
of Security. Flagstaff Hill is
located about 100 yards away
from Pitt’s Frick Fine Arts
Building.

One man grabbed the stu-

dent from behind, pinning
her arms to her sides, as
another laid a butterfly knife
across her shoulder and the
third served as lookout.

The men then forced
the victim into the Flagstaff
Hill area of Schenley
Park and raped her before
fleeing toward Phipps
Conservatory.

The victim was treated for
minor injuries.

City and campus police are
investigating the incident but
have no suspects as of yet,
CMU Sergeant William Ricci
said.

“That area is usually pretty
quiet,” Ricci said.

Chief of Campus Police

James LaPaglia said that he
was increasing nightly patrols
after the incident. Like Pitt,
CMU’s student government is
working on a student escort
service.

According to Kendrick
Chua, editor of CMU’s stu-
dent newspaper, outsiders
are causing trouble on cam-
pus rnore frequently as of
late.

“If you look in our police
blotter, you’ll see another
incident last week in which a
group of men were trying
to coerce a drunk female
student to come with
them,” Chua said. “lLast
Sunday’s case] was pretty
unnerving.”

Volunteers work hand-in-Ia and

By Beth Kovaly

Asst News Editor

Volunteers work all year for one day in

March.

On that afternoon, Pitt students gather in
Forbes Quad to host games, fun and laughter.

The guests of honor at this party are handi-
capped children from the Pittsburgh area.

March 27 will be the 15th annual Hand-in-
Hancl festival at Pitt. This student organization
spends the many months before the festival
planning a day of whirlwind activity for about
400 mentally or physically handicapped chil-
dren between the ages of three and 18.,

Each child is paired with a college student

for the carnival-like festivities, which is why
the day takes about 400 to 500 student volun-

ICCFS.

Activities usually include a visit from the Pitt

Cheerleaders, a performance by the sign group

Beautiful Hands, booths organized by student
groups and a petting zoo set up by the
Pittsburgh Zoo.

Tina Ciletti, one of the festival’s coordinators,
said that while spirits are high, money is a little
tighter than usual this year.

“It takes $13,000 to do the festival,” Ciletti
explained. “We’re allocated so much money
from the Student Government Board and the
rest is private funds —-— we have to raise that

Alpha Chi

newest fraternity at Pitt  

By Malt Groff
Sta_ﬁ"Writer

After becoming a fraternity incin-

ber at Pitt, David Davis knew he
liked the Greek system but thought
that there were still a lot of people
who were “missing out" on fraterni-
ty life. , .
“I think there are a lot of students
out there who would like to join a
fraternity,” Davis said. “But they
may not have found one that suits
them or one where they ‘fit in.”

Davis realized that he was
not the only person with this
idea. So he, along with Sol
Chilcis, founded a new fraternity
at Pitt Alpha Chi Tau.
Childs and Davis said the purpose
of this fraternity is to attract those
who may have been hesitant to
join an established fraternity
because of all of the “image” that is
involved.

“In most fraternities, the young
guys have little effect on what the
organization is doing,” Childs said.
“Since we are just starting, mem-
bers of our fraternity will have an
immediate impact."

According to the co—founders,
they are currently organizing mem-
bers to take part in the process of
fonning an entirely new Pitt frater-
nity.

“I like the excitement of this
whole process,” Chilcis said. “The
people who join this year will help
us to determine the course of our
fraternity, from picking the colors
and symbols to everything else. It’s

Childs stresses, however, that the
purpose of this new fraternity is to
expand the Greek system at Pitt.

 are not looking to draw
anyone away from the current
Greek system,” Chilcis said. “We
just want to expand the scope of
people which the Greeks can
reach.”

Davis said Alpha Chi Tau will be.
looking to the Inter-Fraternity
Council for recognition and incin-
bership next year. The fraternity
plans to participate in community
events this year, including the
Hancl—in—I-land festival, until it can
contnbute to activities as part of the
IFC.

“We don‘t plan to apply to IFC
just for social reasons,” Davis said.
“Certainly the social aspect is a part
of our fraternity, but we want to
participate in activities like Greek
Week in the future.”

The group currently has 23
members and is growing. Many
people, the founders said, have
expressed interest in this fraternity
due to its pledge to give newcorn—
ers a voice, its inexpensiveness and
because they are “making their
own history."

“It's great working on a project
like this,” member Matthew Sataloﬁ‘
said. “We face a lot of adversity try-
ing to get something like this start-
ed, but it’s exciting just to know
that you’re an important part of its
history if it succeeds.”

College students not just early 20s

Byjudith A. Friedl
For T be Pitt News

Say “college students” to
most people and they might
picture eager young men and
women clustered around study
tables arguing philosophy or
physics, or cheering on the
football team from the student
bleachers.

But more and more college
students are weary-looking
folks studying alone at the din-
ing room table after the kids
are finally asleep who cheer
on the midget football team
from the parents’ section.

Whether fulfilling a long-
held dream or trying to
increase their take-home pay
in a hostile economy, adults
from their late 20s to retire-
ment age are going to college.
There’s even a name for them:
non-traditional age students.

Co-director of special stu-
dent programs in the College
of Arts and Sciences and coor-
dinator of continuing educa-

tion for degree—seeking NTA
students Richard S. Wood said
that he advises 90 to 100 NTA
students each term. Wood
advises these students from
admission until they declare
their majors.

CAS majors top the list, fol-
lowed by health—related pro-
fessions, information science
and social work. Few enter
engineering, nursing or phar-
macy.

According to Wood, there
has been a slight increase in
NTA students registered at Pitt
each year since he became the
coordinator in 1989. In July
1989 he had 80 advisees, 80
percent of them women. The
number rose to between 90
and 1OO this term, and the
ratio of women to men is now
roughly 50-50.

“Being 27 and going to a
university is just another cul-
turally diversified experience,”
said “Slick Scandal,” who
wished to remain anonymous.

ple because I’ve been in the
military and worked a couple
of years.” He said he takes the
degree he’s working for more
seriously than some of the stu-
dents he sees around him,
because he’s more aware of
what it can do for him.

Joe Smith, 29, earned an
associate degree from
Community College of
Allegheny County in 1987,
then joined the Navy. He came
to Pitt in the fall of 1992 as a
junior.

Smith moved from Navy life
as an adult back to living with
his parents because he said it
was cheaper.

He said there is a big differ-
ence in his attitude toward col-
lege life now. He used to sit at
the back of the room during
lectures so he wouldn’t miss
what his buddies were doing,
then come out to Oakland
after class to party with friends
from Pitt.

Pregnant women exposed to therapeutic agents can be laelpea

By Maral Halajian
For The Pitt News

Sometimes a ray of hope is far
more meaningful than all the
diagnoses offered by physicians.
This is where the role of the
Pittsburgh Genetics Institute (PGI)
of the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center (UPMC) comes
into play.

For pregnant women who have
been, or are expected to be
exposed to therapeutic agents for
the treatment of diseases such as
cancer and kidney disease, the
PGI offers access to a National
Database. This database will pro-
vide the women with thorough

information about the likely con-
dition of their fetuses and their
reproductive health in general,
based on records obtained from
similar cases.

“This unique information
source allows us to assist preg-
nant women and their physicians
in making decisions concerning
the rare case of exposure to
chemotherapeutic agents and the
risk of their reproductive health,”
said John J. Mulvihill, M.D, PGI
co—d'rrector.

Information available from the
database includes medical and
obstetric history, confounding fac-
tors, chemotherapeutic expo-
sures, a week-by—week chronicle

of the pregnancy and the birth
outcome including weight, gesta-
tional age and any speciﬁc abnor-
malities.

“The registry offers not only
information, but also hope. When
chemotherapeutic exposure
occurs during pregnancy, one’s
first thought is usually the worst-
case scenario. The registry con-
tains many favorable outcomes of
pregnancy, along with an expect-
ed increase in the number of
cases with birth defects,” Mulvihill
said.

Only a pregnant woman who
has received the exposure to can-
cer therapy, sometime between
two weeks prior to conception

through the end of pregnancy, is
eligible to gain access to the
information provided by the reg-
istry.

The registry can be accessed
through the pregnancy safety line
at (412) 647-4168, 24 hours a day,
only by the pregnant woman her-
self or a health care professional
working on her behalf. All infor-
mation regarding patient identifi-
cation is conﬁdential.

The registry was started by
Mulvihill in 1985 while he was at
the National Institutes of Health
(NIH). It is coordinated by PGI
and Magee-Women’s Hospital.
The registry lists over 300 cases,
with 60 new cases reported in the

past two years. Each registry case
chronicles a pregnancy and its
exposure to particular drugs
and/or radiation as well as other
potential complicating factors.

A pregnant woman exposed to
any of those conditions can
receive helpful information by
tapping into the database for
cases where the conditions are
the same as hers. In this way, she
will be able to determine a
course of action quickly. On the
other hand, if data are not avail-
able for a similar case, then the
callers own case will be entered
into the registry to benefit other
pregnant women with similar
Conditions.

Bagels taking Oakland by storm

Byjason Hillman
Editor in Chief

its soft, it’s round, it’s got a
hole, and it’s taking Oakland by
storm. It’s the bagel. ,

Once a wasteland for lovers
of the round mound of dough,
Oakland now features two
bagel bakeries/restaurants.

The elder, Schwartz’s Bagels,
located at 3615 Forbes Ave., has
been operating since February
of last year. The more recent
addition to the bagel market,
Bruegger’s Fresh Bagel Bakery
located down the street at 3714
Forbes Ave., opened this past

December.

Schwartz’s is operated by
Marty Schwartz and Roy
Feldman. Although Feldman is
from New Jersey and Schwartz
is from Brooklyn, the two met
in Burlington, Vt., and together
opened a bagel bakery in 1979.
They ran the bakery for 10
years and then sold it.

“We were compelled to do it,”

‘Feldman said. “We were both

bagel lovers. We grew up just
enjoying the product. Very
clearly, whenever anybody from
Vermont went down to the New
York area, the big request was
bring back bagels. Whether

“It saved us a lot of traveling
to get bagels,” Schwartz said.

The two, along with
Schwartz’s two sons, Mark and
Doug, decided to relocate in
Pittsburgh after selling their old
bakery. They picked Pittsburgh
because they liked the area,

liked the fact that there was a A

baseball team and the town was
“comfortable,” Schwartz said.
Schwartz’s emphasizes the
fact that all of their bagels are
made from scratch every day.
“It’s a daily struggle to work
hard and make a great bagel,”
Feldman said. “And we do it.
And it’s paid off because I think
that clearly customers notice
when the product’s good.
“We’re not a big out-of-state
corporation with tentacles far-
reaching to city markets all over
the country. We’re simply here.
You can walk in here and find a
Schwartz almost any time.”
Schwartz’s Cream Cheese is
100 percent real cream cheese,
according to both Feldman and
Schwartz. They buy it from a
supplier in Pennsylvania and

V mix the ﬂavors in the store.

B1uegger’s is a chain of stores.
The location on Forbes Avenue
is the first of the chain to open
in Pennsylvania. Other branches
are open or opening in Squirrel
Hill and Market Square.

“One of the things they do
when they open their stores,”
General Manager Kurt Flodine
said, “they go for college areas,
business areas, and this falls
under the headline of both.”

There are currently around 60
stores in Vermont, New York,
North Carolina, Massachusetts,
Missouri, Minnesota and Iowa.
The chain will celebrate its 10th
anniversary next month.

“You can get a bagel any-
where in this town,” Flodine
said. “We have a good bagel.
There are other places around
here that put‘out good bagels. I
think our service and our will-
ingness to please is what sets us
apart from other people. Plus
the atmosphere of the store is
warm, friendly and welcoming.”

While many people are
trying hard to eat right,
while the 50th celebrity
comes out with his or her
own diet plan, there is a
store lurking in the streets
of Oakland. A store which is
dietetically incorrect.

That store is Goodies,
Oakland’s resident candy
outlet. Owner Jerry Dimple
will begin his seventh year
in the business this July.

“I liked the idea of candy,
and there wasn’t a whole lot
of preparation to it,” Dimple
said.

After working to sell all
sorts of things, varying from
sporting goods to cars to
grave plots, Dimple said he
decided to go into business
for himself.

“I just couldn’t see myself
selling cars for. the rest of
my life. The fact is I
couldn’t see myself selling
cars the next day. So I just
told the manager, ‘I quit’
and went out and looked for
a business,” Dimple said.

Dimple chose the candy
business because, “It
seemed like a very nice
business. It’s happy. People
who walk in are happy, and
people who walk out are

happy. They’re not bringing
something in that needs
fixed and are mad because
it’s broke. It’s a pleasant
business.”

Although he originally
made his own candy,
Dimple stopped when his
business grew. He sought
out a chocolate maker from
whom he could buy.

“Taking out the labor time
that’s involved in making
candy and buying it direct,
already made and with a
much greater variety, the
price was almost identical.
So the profit was the same
 I decided that’s one thing
I won’t have to do. I can
watch the Super Bowl on
Sunday instead of making
chocolates,” Dimple said.

Due to the location,
Goodies has a mix of pro-
fessional and student cus-
tomers. Dimple said that the
tastes of the two vary a lot.
Students go for the new can-
dies, while the older people
tend to go with older can-
dies —— “things that they got
off their grandmothers and
from candy jars.”

Of the over 400 different
types of candies stocked at
Goodies, Swedish Red Fish
are the hot item among stu-
dents, Dimple said. “They
are a quiet food. So I think

The tides of the world are changing. As the United States
approaches the next century it will no doubt have to continually
redefine its role in the world. For now, it is the world’s one
great military power. Its sheer number of missiles and advanced
weaponry dictate as such. J

Just recently though, President Clinton announced his pledge
to support Japanese and German entrance as permanent mem-
bers into the U.N. Security Council. The Council has 15 mem-
bers. Only five of them, however, are permanent — Russia,
China, France, Britain and the United States — which means
they can block any action with a veto.

By supporting Japanese and German entrance into the U.N.,
President Clinton has affirmed the changing status of world pol-
itics. Rightfully so, he sees the “New World Order” as pragmatic
and not one that must necessarily be defined by U.S. hegemo-
r1Y- _

It’s only logical. Security members such as Great Britain and
Fiance have seen their roles decline greatly in recent years.
Likewise, the successes of Japan and Germany have seen former
“second rate” countries rival the most powerful of competitors.

Amidst all of the blunders of the new administration,
President Clinton’s decision to support Japanese and German
entrance into the Security Council is wise. Most importantly, it
signals the changing face of world politics.

Foreign policy will no longer be defined by military strength.
Japan and Germany are being considered because of their con-
tributions to the U.N. budget — which is larger than Britain’s,
France’s and China’s (who are members because of their mili-
tary power). In this new world order riches are going to rule
and not rockets. Let’s hope President Clinton and his staff will
keep that in mind. At least they have one security member to
continually remind them of that.

Gun laws are problems

Governor Douglas Wilder of Virginia, in his attempt to stop
the proliferation of guns in Virginia and Washington, D.C.,
made one of the wackiest political decisions in recent memory.
His recent proposal to limit the purchase of handguns to one
per month could hardly be expected to make even a minor dent
in the number of crimes committed with a gun.

Regardless of how ineffective Wilder’s proposal would turn
out to be, something had to be done. Its neighbor, Washington,
D.C., boasts the highest murder rate in this country. Yet it has
banned the sale of firearms since 1976. .

Clearly, Virginia (with some of the most liberal gun laws in
the nation) had to accept some of the responsibility for the
problems in our nation’s capital. Forty-one percent of all gun
crimes in Washington, D.C., were committed with a gun from
Virginia (and 20 percent from Maryland).

The. National Rifle Association has, as could be expected,
come out against Wilder’s proposals. There is no doubt that gun
rationing is ridiculous, but something has to be done to halt gun
use. We do not favor repealing the second amendment.

Permits or waiting periods hardly violate one’_s constitutional
right to bear arms. Stricter background checks involving the
speedy use of a computer could also go a long way to halt gun
proliferation.

We all know that people — not guns — kill other people. But
we also know that some people use guns to kill others. If a
background check could keep one potential murderer from
acquiring a gun and killing somebody, then we say that is
enough.

A solution to the smoking problem

Have_ you been reading the

‘news lately? I am constantly

reminded of the headlines rolling

off the presses in Citizen Kane, ’

when every day I am affronted
by a barrage of glaring headlines
about the tragic consequences of
smoking and the detrimental
effect of tobacco on society in
general. The latest news comes
from the Environmental
Protection Agency which esti-
mates that 3,000 people will die
each year from diseases related
to second-hand smoke.

Our government and private
sectors are up in arms. On Jan.
26, the Post—Gazette ran not one,
but two stories on smoking. On
the front page, we learned that
at Pittsburgh's airport
travelers must venture
about a mile from
where they’re sup-
posed to be just to _
catch :1 quick smoke.
In the state of
Kentucky, where
tobacco is still the
biggest cash crop,
smoking has been
banned in all govern-
ment buildings.

This is really getting
out of hand, folks.
More important than
the threat of second-
hand smoke is the
need for people
to View ‘things in
perspective. Let’s
establish a few facts
before delving into the contro-
versy.

Let’s draw a neat comparison,
say, between second—hancl
smoke and the AIDS virus. The
similarities are more than you
would expect. Second-hand
smoke is, essentially, the product
of a particular voluntary human
behavior, that behavior being the
act of smoking. Those on the
receiving end of second-hand
smoke did not ask to be
exposed to this hazard, right’ Of
course. So, second-hand smoke
is the evil by—product of smok-
ing, which is responsible for
3,000 deaths annually.

13$ Hllit 7'“

With that established, let us
consider — AIDS is a disease
that is unique in that it is not
transferred by airborne particles
but by a particular voluntary

human behavior, i.e. shared nee-~

dles, unprotected sex. Next year,
according to AIDS authorities,
over 55,000 people in America
will contract the AIDS virus (HIV
if you prefer) and every one of
them will eventually be killed by
this disease, no exceptions.

So why is the behavior of
AIDS victims allowed by our
government to go unchecked?

Chris

Diersen

Nobody boots heroine with the
intention of contracting AIDS,
nor does anyone engage in
unprotected sex in hopes of
slow, painful death. Much in the
same way, non-srnokers don’t
inhale second-hand smoke pur-
posely with the intention of
developing lung cancer. That’s
preposterous.

In their craze to end the ram-
pant destruction caused by sec-
ond-hand smoke, the U.S. gov-
ernment has voluntarily created
smokers’ colonies. If you dis-

agree, take a look at any

entrance to the Cathedral of
Learning during classes; each has

it’s own colony. Unfortunately,
controlling AIDS in this manner
will require more draconian
measures.

Yet, the government and pri-
vate sectors have regulated the
behavior of smokers to spare
3,000, so why is the behavior of
AIDS victims continuing
unwatched? Upwards of 55,000
dead? My goodness. Why does
our government allow this?

There’s a much simpler solu-
tion to both of these problems.
Ever since the human race has
gotten leprosy under control,
there have been thousands of
islands just crying for a colony.
So what we need is an AIDS
colony, a smokers’ colony, and
while we’re at it,
why not throw in
a drunk drivers’
colony and a sex
offenders’ colony.
Why stop there?
There are islands
aplenty! Let’s have
a colony for every
type of deviant.

Consider — It
seems strikingly
hypocritical to this
writer that a gov-
ernment,
not only endorses,
but encourages
over a million
abortions annually
for the sake of
choice and popu-

._ lation control,
would infringe on the right to
choose of a large percentage of
the population in order to shelter
3,000 people who are probably
contributing to overpopulation
anyway.

I sincerely hope that you, the
reader, agree with me. Because
if you do, I’ve got a nice plot of
land in Florida and a great used
car that I’ve been trying to sell,
and I think you may be my per-
fect customer.

Just thought I’d let you know.

And hey, lighten up.

The model criminal

Jan. 5, Westly Allan Dodd,
hooded and in sneakers,
heard the lasts sound of his
life — a trap-door lock being
released.

The hanging was quick,
clean and deserved. When
Westly Allan Dodd was con-
victed for raping, torturing
and murdering three young
boys he was given the choice
to die by hanging or _by lethal
injection. Today’s system
could easily have bought 10
to 20 more years of life in
appeals court and mental
wards for Mr. Dodd. But he
chose to accept his punish-
ment for his heinous crimes
and have it carried out imme-
diately. On top of that he
selected hanging, because he
saw it more fitting for the
crime he committed, since he
strangled one

the inside they were cheering
like it was a game show.

If anti-death penalty act-
ivists want to cry that its not
right to leill another human
being, let us think about the
number lives that are saved
when somebody contem-
plates killing somebody else
but chooses not to because
they fear the death penalty.

If nothing else, the Dodd
case is forcing people to
think again about execution.
It is forcing people to see the
harsh consequences of bru-
tally torturing, raping and
killing in our society. Maybe
the thought of having a rope
slipped over your head, hav-
ing it tightened ever so gen-
tly and then having a black
hood engulf your skull so it
leaves only your imagination

w 0 n d e r i n g

of his young . what is going
victims. My  to happen next
question is, and finally
why can’t  hearing a
there be more

criminals like this?

1965 was the last official
hanging in the United States.
Then, because of constitu-
tional one—liners like “cruel
and unusual,” the capital
punishment law was revoked
for further review. Since
regaining constitutional
acceptance 16 years ago, exe-
cutions have been on the
rise. Texas alone has execut-
ed 12 men in one year’s time.

This leads me to the ques-
tion of why are mitt-death
penalty activists protesting
this particular case on the
grounds of cruel and unusual
punishment? Especially since
Mr. Dodd, in his tribute to
society, elected for the more
unusual method.

And the only reason it is
unusual is because society
doesn’t do it enough.

I don’t think the families of
the three little children who
were raped, brutally tortured
and strangled would care if it
hurt a little, considering that
there were family members
of the murdered children in
the audience during the
hanging. Sure they were cry-

ing on the outside from the

echoing memories, but on

solemn voice
say “NOW!” might just put
the threat back into death.

Supporters of the death
penalty argue that this is part
of the point of having this
harsh penalty. Capital punish-
ment is meant to deter injus-
tice and to show the determi-
nation of the states to uphold
the law.

On that view, the penalty
might as well be as gruesome
and public as possible. For
those of you out there who
think that criminals should be
rehabilitated and not just
killed, you’re living in the
land of fairy tales.

One-tenth of one percent of
capital offenders can be relia-
bilitated to the point at which
they are safe to society. And
they are rehabilitated. In the
case of Dodd, I think he was
rehabilitated. He saw quite
clearly his grotesque mistake
in life.

He obviously saw that the
only fair punishment for his
crimes was hanging. He
should be considered a
hero; he killed a child mur-
derer.

Thoughts on the inauguration

The 52nd Presidential
Inauguration was billed as “an
American Reunion,” and I, for
one, was bound and deter-
mined to be a part that get-
together. \Vrth my destination in
mind, I left the Pittsburgh
Greyhound station at 1:50 a.m.,
Wednesday, Jan. 20. There were
approximately 35 of us on that
bus, and our goal was simple:
to witness the inauguration of
America’s 42nd president,
William Jefferson Clinton.
Although it was late, there was
an air of excitement as we
cruised down the turnpike en
route to our date with destiny.

By the time-we reached
Washington, D.C., at around
5:30, the traffic was already hec-
tic. We weren’t the only ones
who wanted to see the new
president. We arrived-at 6:30.

My friend and I were met by
the University Democrat secre-
tary who had gone down the
previous Friday. After we
arrived at his mother's apart-
ment, we rested for a while and
then watched the inauguration

on television. (Tickets to the .

event had been sold out since
before the new year.) This was
only a minor quibble, though.

After Bill Clinton took the
oath of office, he turned to
address the crowd before him
and to the entire nation. It was
his moment to shine. When he
spoke, he no longer‘ spoke as a
Democrat but as the president
of the United States. He moved
from being political to presiden-
tial.

The address itself was surpris-
ingly concise (which is some-
thing of a minor miracle for
good ol’ Bill). He spoke of rec-
onciliation and renewal. He
asserted “that there is nothing

.wrong with America that cannot

be cured by what is right about
America.” Amidst all the opti-
mistic rhetoric, he sounded a

note of caution, noting that bet-

tering America “will require sac-
rifice.” Well—written and upbeat
in tone, it was one of the better
inaugural addresses in recent
memory. (Even conservative
columnist William Safire liked
it.)

Later that evening, over 3,000

youths, such as myself, gathered
to for the College Democrat
Inaugural Ball. It was here that
we celebrated the election of
the first Democratic president
that anyone our age could

Shawn
McClearn

remember.

The inauguration. committee
did its best to make sure that
we wouldn’t forget this one.
The entertainment included the
likes of Steel Pulse and Salt-’n’-
Peppa.

As it approached 9:30, Al and
Tipper Gore arrived to offer
their thanks and congratula-
tions. Needless to say, the
response was oveiwlielrrringly
positive. As the band launched
into Paul Simon's “You Can Call
Me Al" the Veep and Tipper
treated the crowd to a dance.
Normally stiff and wooden, Al
and Tipper tripped the light fan-
tastic. The best, however, was
yet to come. About three__hours
later, the president and the first
lady themselves tirade an
appearance.

As they were met with enthusi-
astic cheers, they thanked the
crowd for their efforts and
pointed out that during the
campaign, he often had us (the
youth of America) in mind. Eor
President Clinton and Hillary
Clinton (let us pause here and
give these lovely words a
chance to sink in) it was a time
to share their triumph with their

supporters. We were more than
happy to share it with them.

So what did I learn from my
trip to the inauguration? That
after 16 long years, the
Democratic Party proved that it
can get down with the best of
them.

I learned that Americans need
a reason to celebrate them-
selves, and that the presidential
inauguration is the perfect
opportunity to do that. Perhaps
iriost importantly, I learned that
Bill Clinton has at least one key
trait of a master politician: the
ability to connect with the aver-
age American.

George Bush’s fatal flaw was
the perception that he ‘was. out
of touch with the "real world”
(remember how amazed he
was by an electronic checkout
counter?). President Clinton
already has an advantage over
his predecessor in this area.
Although the whole affair has
evoked comparisons to the
Kennedy administration, its
more accurate to say that Bill
Clinton more closely resembles
Lyndon Johnson.

Like Johnson, his humble
roots give him an insight into
the American psyche. He said
that when he began to plan for
his inauguration, he wanted to
have something for everybody.

Judging from the response,

he succeeded. From Little Feat

on the mall to a visit with Mr.
Rogers, there was something to
keep even the most cynical
observer entertained. The entire
affair demonstrated
President Clinton has an excel-
lent grasp of American popular
culture.

Wherever he went, he always
appeared relaxed and at ease,
as if he was honestly enjoying
himself. Judging from recent
controversies, such as the issue
of gays in the military and his
lifting of a number of abortion
restrictions, he’s going to be

needing that “common touch” ‘

quite a bit over the next four to
eight years. Good luck, Mr.
President, you’re going to need
it.

Pittsburgh welcomes the return of the Post-Gazette

After eight long months it came back. I am
not speaking of the respect for Pitt sports
(that has been missing for much longer than
eight months), rather, the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette What is the best part of this return?
Well my friends, I am going to tell you.

The local news broadcasts in this city have
gonefrom stupid to worthless. Thanks to the
return of the paper, we no longer need to be
tortured by these wastes of broadcast space.
By pickingon WPXI, I am not saying that
they are the only station at fault Because the
Associated Press voted WPXI number one in
the state, it is easier to show how even the
“best” televised, local news source is junk.

On Jan. 19, 1993, hostilities intensified
between U.S. and Iraqi forces. Hoping to get
the latest development, I tuned into Channel
11 news at 11 p.m. Instead of infomiation

to Channel 11 was more important. It did not

occur this day, mind you, it was going to
trial. While this is of the utmost importance to
“Geraldo” and soap opera writers, what pur-
pose does it serve? Even if it should be
included as “news,” should this story out-
weigh the war in Iraq? My blood is
approaching the boiling level when the next
tidbit arrives. This story is the one about the
boy that moved to play basketball for Shaler
High School and was barred

Perhaps Dave and Peggy accidentally read

For instance, Channel 11 provides the

money.”
, Part of those private funds in
the past 14 years came from the
United Way, she said. This year,
however, those donations were
not there. i _

“It was totally unexpected,”
Ciletti said. “[T he United Way]
said that the funds were just
unavailable this year.”

Scott Frost, vice president for
United Way allocations, said that
the funding given to Pitt in the

past came from private dona-
tions to the United Way, specifi-
cally requesting money go to
the’ Hand-in—Hand festival. This
year, donations were not made

with that request, he said.

“We are a vehicle for people
to support any charitable cause,”
Frost said. “We’re a pass‘-
through, we make it conve-
nient.” '

Fund—raising Secretary Kelly
Reddy said that not getting the
United Way donation “was dis-

appointing, but it just gave us
extra incentive to go out and
solicit help from other people.”

“We’re asking student groups
and organizations to contribute
as much as they “can,” Reddy
said. “We’re also sending out
letters to businesses in the
Oakland community.”

Even without the funding,
Reddy said there is a strong
commitment to the Hand-in-
Hand festival.

.“We’ve gotten a really good

response from different organi-
zations across campus,” she
said. “There was never a
moment of doubt that our dedi-
cation — the dedication or the
community and students -
wouldn’t pull it through.”

The group’s advisor John
Conlogue agreed that the festi-
val has gotten a lot of groups’
support.

“For example, several resi-
dence halls raised money
through the Lothrop Challenge,”

Conlogue said. “Fund—raising
efforts have been on par with
those of other years.”

Ciletti said groups that are
donating include the Black
Action Society, the Inter-
Fraternity Council and the
Student Government Board.

Other groups that participate
include fraternities and sorori-
ties. Sigma Phi Epsilon President
David Ondesko said his fraterni-
ty is participating because there
was a concern.

“Since we’ve been on campus
the past four years we’ve partici-
pated every year,” Ondesko
said. “It bothered us, seeing
there was a financial threat to it,
because it’s a fantastic program.”

Ondesko said that the fraterni-

whatever funds were collected.

Women's hoops cools
off, loses three straight

By]. Allen Brame
and Neil Chaudhuri
The Pitt News

The Panthers were looking for
a helping hand back into the Big
East race this weekend. Instead
they got the cold shoulder.

The University of Pittsburgh
women’s basketball team
dropped its second- and third-
straight decisions against the
Class of the Big East with a 50-
55 loss to the University of
Miami Friday night and a 77-64
loss at St. John’s on Sunday after-
noon.

Coming off a loss to the
University of Connecticut, the
Panthers hoped to rebound
against the conferences leading
team, Miami, the 20th-ranked
team in the country (AP and USA
Today polls).

It has been the ‘Canes’ outside
strength, especially from beyond
the three-point stripe, that oppo-
nents fear. First—year sniper Holly
Rilinger, one of the league’s best
sharp-shooters, was never a fac-
tor, however, as Miami head
coach Ferne Labati looked inside
to powerful center _ Vicki
Plowden.

“The main thing for us was to
try to get the ball inside on the
low post because [the Panthers]
weren’t fronting me, so the

coach told us to take advantage
of that and play good defense,”
Plowden said.

Plowden led all scorers with
24 points and 14 rebounds. She
was also a defensive force, hold-
ing Panther centers Turia
Ransom, Carolyn Miller and Julie
Fornadel to only 11 total points.

“This was a big game for
lPlowdenl,” Panther head coach
Kirk Bruce said. “We tried to
make sure to come out and pres-
sure her and keep her from get-
ting her hands on the ball. We
just played her too soft.”

Once again forward Jonna
Huemrich paced the Panthers,
scoring 16 points and grabbing
16 boards. She was, however,
virtually shut down in the sec-
ond half as the Miami defense

- limited her to only one field goal

on six tries.

“lThe Miami defense] stepped
it up in the second half,” Bruce
said. “They were real physical
with lHuemrichl. She just
couldn’t get her hands on the
ball.”

The fist half proved to be a
microcosm .of the game, as the
Panthers would build up a dou-
ble—digit lead only to see it fade
away after a Miami run.

points with 8:57 remaining in the

Youth is served for men's track and ﬁeld at Eastern Michigan

By Jason Feuchtwanger
Staff‘ Writer

The youth of the Pitt men’s
track team certainly did not
show at the Eastern Michigan
Open this Saturday.

“A lot of freshmen have
stepped in and are doing real
well,” Pitt head coach John
Vasvary said. “The sophomores
have grown since last year, and
that’s important.”

The underclassmen showed
no signs of their inexperience
as they led the team to a strong
performance in a non-scoring
meet against schools from the
Big Ten, smaller schools from
Michigan and Ohio along with
several unattached, open
entries.

Sophomore Wes Alexander
led the Panthers’ youth with a
win in the,200-meter hurdles
that set a meet record with a
time of 24.2 seconds.
Alexander also ran his fastest
time of the year in placing third
in the 55 hurdles with a time of
7.62 seconds. _

Two sophomores led the
team in the distance events.
Sophomore Frank Nesko won
the 3,000 meter with a time of
8:41.6. Sophomore Mike
Umbleby placed third in the
mile run with 4:19.95.

Two first—year distance run-
ners also turned in strong
showings. First—year student
Matt Clarkson finished second
in the 3,000 meter with a time
of 8243.9. First-year runner

Severino stars for men's

Although the Pitt men’s gym-
nastics team dropped its meet at
Penn State this past weekend by
a rather decisive 268.60 to
250.85 score, head coach Frank
D’Amico was able to lead his
team out of Penn State with an
accomplishment to which no
other Panther gymnast can lay
claim.

After the meet, Pitt’s senior
captain Genaro Severino was
awarded the prestigious “Gene
Wettstone Award,” an award

senior co—captain Sean Braud
won the three-meter event.

At Villanova, the divers
took the top three spots in
both events, helping the
team build an insurmount-
able lead against the
Wildcats. McClean led the
way in the one-meter, while
Braud paced Pitt in the
three-meter. ‘

Pitt’s swimmers also per-
formed well on Saturday at
Villanova, with Brady leading
Pitt once again with two
more victories. Brady took
firsts in the 200 IM and the
200 backstroke.

Junior Zac Economos, who
has swam particularly well
the last two weeks‘, also had
dual victories, in both the 50
and 100 free’styl‘e events. In
the 100 freestyle, Economos
had to hold Off threeof his
teammates to take the victo-
ry. _
Mule and Fortner both con-
tinued their strong weekends
with victories in the 1,000
freestyle and 200lbutterfly,
respectively.

SPLISHES AND SPLASH-
ES: Pitt will be in action this
weekend’ when the team
travels to Ohio State for a 5
p.m. meet this Friday before
facing Ohio University this

ing gymnast at each Nittany

Wettstone is considered by
many in his sport to be the
“father of gymnastics," which
would place him somewhere on
the coaching level equal to that
of Bobby Knight in basketball
or Paul “Bear” Bryant in foot-
ball.

Wettstone coached at Penn
State for 34 years, and since his
retirement, the award bearing
his name has served as a mark-
er of excellence in gymnastics.

See Severino, page 13

Denn'is Kulntz finished sixth in
the 5,000 meter with a time of
15:44.86.

In the sprints it was three
first—year students leading the
way.

Jay Jones sprinted to a sec-
ond-place finish in the 55-
meter dash with a time of 6.39
seconds. He qualified in the 55-
meter dash for the Eastern
Championships (IC4As) earlier
in the season. Jones also quali-
tied for IC4As in the 200 meter
with atime of 22.24 seconds.

Jay Murphy ran to a fourth-
place finish in the 55-meter
dash with a time of 7.63. Curtis
Anderson qualified for IC4As
with a third—place time of 6.48
in the 55-meter dash. Anderson
also qualified for IC4As in the

200 meter with a time of 22.23.

“As a team we accomplished
what we wanted,” Anderson
said. “Personally, I’m pretty
relieved. I got through my run-
ner’s block.

“This is giving us [freshmen
and sophomores] the feeling
that we can win when we step
up to the [starting] line.”

One of the few upperclass—'

men on the team, junior Tim
Flanders, turned in a record-
setting performance.

Flanders won the pen-
tathalon with 3,676 points,
and in the process set a
school record and qualified for
IC4As.

The pentathalon consists of
the long jump, high jump, 55
hurdles, 1,000 meter and the

shot—put. Flanders also finished
fifth in the high jump with a
jump of 6 feet 6 inches.

“This was the first time I
competed in the pentathalon,
besides an inter—squad scrim-
mage, so I’m happy,” Flanders
said.

Something else that he said
made him happy was the per-
formance of the Panther youth
element.

“The young guys are step-
ping up and showing a lot of
maturity,” Flanders said.
“They’re doing really well.”

Next week the Panthers will
split up and part of the team
will travel to Notre Dame and
part of the team will travel to

Ben Rovee said she will
be okay.

“Karen getting hurt
could have taken the
wind out of our sails, but
it did not,” Yohman said.

The team finished the
bars with a score of
46.20. Shannon Brown
(9.25), Bethany Toellner
(8.75) and Friend (9.7)
earned career-high
scores.

Friend’s effort was
good enough to place her
in a tie for fourth on the
Pitt all-time scoring list.
The remaining scores
were Kristen Brown with
a 9.0 and Myers with
another strong showing
(9.5).

The third event and the
most questionable one
going in was the beam.
Rovee said he was so
nervous that he could not
even watch. He should
have because their per-
formance was definitely
worth noticing, earning a
_team score of 46.05.

Deena Daller and Myers
both received a 9.4, rep-
resenting their career
highs.

The Lady Panthers fin-
ished their first home
meet of the year on floor

where they tallied a score
of 46.50.

Daller (8.75) and
Battista (9.0) scored
career bests and Toellner
earned a 9.25. The high-
lights of this event were
the efforts of Kristen
Brown and Friend. Brown
tied her career high with
a 9.7, which is fifth on
the Pitt all-time scoring
list. Friend finished her
career best all-around

effort" (37.75) with a 9.8, '

tying her for first on the
all-time scoring list.

“We are going to be the
best gymnastics team Pitt
has ever had,” Myers
said. “This is the year for
Pitt gymnasti_cs.” .

If this recent effort is
any indication as to what
they are capable of
doing, then her predic-
tion will more than likely
prove to be true.

This team will become

even stronger in the next,

couple of weeks with the
return of Heather
Halovanic, Meg Johns and
Brenda Stevens.

“Having them back is
going to help us tremen-
dously,” Friend said.
“Their return will add the
necessary depth to our
lineup.”

first half, went on a 14-4 run to
tie the game at halftime.
Plowden’s jumper with five sec-
onds left in the first notched the
game at 28 and sent the teams
into the locker rooms even.

Labati switched from a soft
zone early in the game to a tight
man—to-man, a defense that the
Panthers had a difficult time
adjusting to. Easily ﬁnding seams
in the soft zone, Pitt guards
found Huemrich slicing on the
baseline for good baskets.

But the man—to-man prevented
the Panthers from finding the
open player. Good ball move-

up free shots, but Pitt did not
convert, hitting only 26.9 percent
of its shots.

In the first half the story for
Pitt was Huemrich. In helping
her team to an early 16-4 lead,
the junior scored the Panthers’
first 12 points.

But Miami refused to be put
away, clawing back to cut the
deficit to as little as eight before
beginning the first of their two
runs.

Miami guard Carla Harris
began the run by hitting the sec-
ond of two free throws. Guard
Dellareese Wilson then hit a

Forward Desma Thomas and

jumpers before Pitt finally
answered with baskets by Lisa
Fessler and Jill Colabrese.

Despite shooting 48 percent
from the floor in the first, Pitt
committed 13 turnovers — a fig-
ure that has remained high
throughout the season.

The second half began with
'Miami’s first lead of the game.
Harris’ steal and layup gave them
a 30-28 advantage.

The Panthers had nothing to
celebrate on Super Bowl Sunday

to the St. John’s Express.
Huemrich, though she finished
with a strong 17 points, hit only
six of her 20 shots. While up by

It is another tough conference
game for Pitt, but Bruce said he
is confident in his team’s
chances.

Severino —

Continued from page 11

Until now, no Panther gymnast I

had ever been honored with
this award.

“This was his best meet ever,”
D’Amico said. “He may have
scored higher in the past but
this was his best competition
ever. In terms of motivation and
inspiration, hands down he was
better than anyone else."

Severino finished second in
the all-around competition,
behind Penn State’s Mike
Masucci, with a total score of
55.60 points, and was one of
only two Pitt competitors to
place in any individual event.

On the still rings, Severino
garnered first-place honors with
a score of 9.55. He was also
able to grab another first-place
finish on the vault, scoring a
9.3().

Severino was also able to
grab second place finishes on
the floor exercises (9.25), on the
parallel bars (9.15) and on the
high bar, with a score of 9.35.

“Genaro may have finished
second in the all-around to
[Penn State’sI Masucci,” D’Amico
said, “But he showed more
class, more poise and just com-
peted better than him. He really
looked good.”

First-year gymnast Keith
Youndt, who drew D’Amico’s
praise, turned in a strong perfor-
mance and scored a third—place
finish on what has become his
strongest event — the still rings
—— with a score of 9.30.

“I’ve had teams at Penn State
that have frozen up and
couldn’t compete, but this team
was different,” D’Amico
explained. “Although we lost, I
think the meet was very positive
and went very well. It is an
incredible stepping stone.”

The Panthers (5-3) will again
hit the road this weekend,
where they will compete in the
Shenandoah Invitational, a tour-
nament that is held annually at
James Madison University.
Joining the Panthers will be
Radford University and William
& Mary, a team that Pitt has

recentl-y grown all too familiar

with.‘ In two previous meets, the

Tribe have already dealt the I

Panthers two of this season’s

_ three losses.

“If we can maintain our poise
and confidence, the outcome
should be different next week
against William & Mary,”
D’Amico said.
