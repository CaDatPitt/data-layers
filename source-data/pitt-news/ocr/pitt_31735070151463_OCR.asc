A single vote could change the Student Gov-
ernment Board Constitution today.

Under existing rules, there is no mini-
mum number of votes required to change
the SGB Constitution, as_ long as a simple
majority of students vote in favor of it.

“Technically, you could have one person
vote and change and dictate everything for
everybody,” Joseph Kozak, SGB’s Judicial
Review Committee chair, said.

Kozak introduced a series of recome
mended changes — or referenda — to the SGB
Constitution and bylaws on Tuesday at the
Board meeting in Nordy’s Place. SGB Presi-
dent Gordon Louderback said the current
versions of these documents include sections.
that are misnumbered, misspelled and not
clearly worded. He also said the bylaws need
to be updated to reﬂect that responsibilities
of the Board that had never been oﬂiciall
documented. _ ’ ‘

The student body  the opportunity to
vote on three referenda to the SGB Constitu-
tion that are on the election ballot today.

One referendum includes the establish-

ment of a minimum amount of votes needed

Former Board ipresidnts deem ites’ ideas feasible

Danielle Fox
Staff Writer

Campaign season has been one long
victory lap for Mike Nites, the only can-
didate in Student Government Board’s
presidential race.

Since Nites is the sole contender for
thepresidency, there are no candidates
pitching campaign initiatives that com-
pete with his own. Two of his major
proposals include establishing a council
of students from outside SGB to offer
feedback and hold the Board account-
able and an effort to audit the Student
Activities Fund to use the $2.3 million
reserve more efficiently.

Nites has proposed creating a legis-
lative body made up of representatives
from Student Affairs Affiliated Groups,
such as the Interfraternity Council and
Resident Student Association. The pro-
posed council would also include rep~
resentatives from Pitt Program Council
and WPTS, as well as other appointed
students.

Nites said his council would pass
resolutions to communicate the student

Abboud was on his way to post his own
ﬂyers, but stopped to give Nites and Ben-
jamin each a hug.

During last year’s election, there were
fewer hugs and more competition between
candidates. Eighteen students vied for
eight board member positions, and the
presidential race was heated.

This year, the odds are in the can-
didates’ favor. Only ten candidates are
running for Board, and Nites is the only
presidential candidate. While the competi-
tion is milder, the candidates said they are

not treating the election any differently.

 

body’s opinion to the Board and hold it
accountable.
Gordon Louderback, current Board

A president, said he thinks establishing

such a council is a good idea and is.fea-
sible as long as the student representa-
tives from the various Student Affairs
Affiliated Groups are interested.

Louderback said he doesn’t think
there is a lack of communication be-
tween the student body andthe Board,
but he does think SGB would benefit
from more student feedback.

“There is no easy way to get the
majority opinion of the student body,”
Louderback said. “I think [the proposed
council] will help towards [addressing
the lack of student representation], but
I don’t think it will solve it. I don’t thin
it’s possible to solve.” ‘

Molly Stieber, president of the Board

» in 2011-2012, agreed with Louderback.

“It’s frankly one of the hardest things
to do when you are in an elected posi-
tion,” Stieber said.

According to Stieber, Board mem-
bers discussed establishing a similar
council in the past. She said while it’s

But the number of votes each candidate
gets still matters.

The Board candidates who get the three
largest amounts of votes will have more
power than the other Board members.
They will act as representatives to the Uni-
versity Senate, and the Board member

who receives the most votes presides over '

the Board as the president pro-tempore if
the president is absent. These incentives
drive the candidates to campaign hard,
even if their attitudes toward one another

-are friendly.

For Jake Radziwon, a candidate run-
ning independently instead of on a slate,
the problem is dress clothes. He hates
them. -

“My roommates are yelling at me for

 

not an easy project to execute, it is fea-
sible.

“It just needs to be very clear about
what exact responsibility the students
on this council can do,” she said. ’

Stieber said the council would be a
good way to attract interest from stu-

. dents outside of SGB. ~ 4 ._
“Obviously, we are seeing a race with

only one candidate,” she said.'“We want

people to run [for SGB], but it can be R

an intimidating process if you are not
already involved in the Board.”

Nites said he also wants to audit the
Student Activities Fund —— the $2.3 mil-

lion fund to which each student pays.

$80 each semester — that the Board
distributes to student groups.

Nites said [he wants to determine
the reason behind the fund’s increas-

. ing overhead, which consists of unused '

and returned money that was previ-
ously given to student organizations.
He also wants to examine "the percent-
age of allocations that formula groups
— groups that receive a set amount of
annual funding — use.

“If [the Board. conducts an audit]

not wearing ties and ‘are getting annoyed '

by me asking, ‘Can I borrow your dress
shoes?”’ Radziwon said.

He prefers casual clothing, and he
personally designed the graphic on his
campaign shirts. I

“I said kiddingly that the main reasonl
was running was because I wanted a shirt
with my name on it,” Radziwon said.

Radziwon is an informal guy. His most

‘ popular campaigning event_ was a tailgate

at the Pitt vs. Notre Dame football game,
and he thinks SGB should listen ﬁrst, act
second and be there to help the average
“kid” with an idea.

Radziwon said he doesn’t possess the
same resources that candidates on slates
do, and he sometimes feels pessimistic

‘ .
and sees that the number of allocations

have been decreasing for the last couple
years, maybe that should be signal to
us that we need to reach out to more
student groups and explain allocations
to them and get them to ask for money,”
Nites said.

Louderback said N ites and the next
Board would have to work with Uni-
versity administrators on the project.
The current Board spent roughly two
months deciding whether to continue
funding Panther Prints, the University
yearbook. As a formula group, Panther
Prints received 1.6 percent of the Stu-
dent Activities Fund each year.

“If the Board starts [the audit] right
away, I think it’s doable,” Louderback
said. I

Stieber said the University already
conducts an internal audit of formula
groups’ budgets. But if mismanaged
funds are becoming a bigger problem
and attract the interest of the student
body, then.Nites should look into it.

“If this is something students really
want [the Board] to do, then do it. That’s

, student government’sjob,” Stieber said.

about being an independent candidate.
Last week, WPTS hosted a candidate
debate in Nordy’s Place, during which

- candidates who were on slates took turns

representing their slates and answering
questions. Radziwon only had himself.
“I went up [to the podium] for my open-
ing statement, and my heart was justlike,
‘ba-boom—ba—boom,”’ Radziwon said. ,
While Radziwon found the rigors of
the debate terrifying, other candidates‘
had an easier time. p
_ Abby Zurschmit, Mona Kazour and
Abboud, who campaign together'on the
Three Rivers slate, take advice from their
campaign slogan and “go with the ﬂow.”

Zurschmit said they picked their name
because it was catchy and incorporated
Pittsburgh. _

“We joke around and say that [our cam-
paign manager] is the Wisconsin Glacial
Flow‘ that keeps the rivers moving, but that
nobody really notices,” Zurschmit said.

The Wisconsin Glacial Flow Zurschmit
was referring to is an aquifer that contrib-
utes water to the Ohio river.

To keep with the theme, Abboud said

the slate spends a lot of time listening to .

John Fogerty’s hit, “Rolling on the River.”

Candidates spend anywhere from three
to eight hours a day with their slate mem-
bers making posters, working on their
campaigns and speaking to student orga-
nizations. On a Sunday, some candidates
speak to 10 student organizations.

In an effort to save time while rushing
from class to Downtown for a promotional
photoshoot, Nites, Klein and Benjamin got
up close and personal with one another as
they changed in the car on the way.

Unfazed by the makeshift dressing
rooms, Klein said the real shock was when
Benjamin pulled a shaving razor out of
his suit jacket and began shaving his face
before having his picture taken.

Lately, members of the slates have be-
gun to notice that they’ve gained a great
deal of chemistry. This chemistry has, at
times, manifested itself in playful teasing.
Benjamin said there is a general ﬂow to the
way his slate speaks to student organiza-
tions — as long as Nites, a self—described
rambler, speaks accordingly.

“Sometimes, Mike just says things that
kill the ﬂow and will give us no opportu-
nity to continue, and we just say, ‘Damnit,
Mike.”’ Benjamin said.

Nites laughed when Benjamin said this
and agreed. _ .

ing.
Barney has been the only candidate to
not_ attend campaigning events offered

by the Elections Committee or to meet j

extensively with student organizations.

Barney said campaigning should fo-
cus on why a candidate wants to make
changes.

“Forget about the who and the what,
it’s the why that keeps the campaign go-
ing,” Barney said.

Every candidate faces unique problems
while campaigning.

For Ron Reha, Ellie Tsatsos and Graeme
Meyer, members of the Pitt Gold slate, the
hardest parts of the campaign have been
making time for schoolwork, keeping their
suits pressed and dealing with the amount
of “crickets” they hear when speaking to
student groups, as Reha put it.

‘ Reha said there is a lack of participa-
tion from the student body, and very few
students ask his slate any questions.

“The toughest question we had is,
“What type of sex toy would you be?,”’
Reha said.

Meyer said he has been asked only two
questions in the campaign so far.

i Tsatsos said her slate has had to explain
to many students what SGB is and what the
Board does, instead of going into detail
about members’ campaign platforms.

“We don’t get a chance to show that
we’ve done all this work,” Tsatsos said.

One question that Benjamin and Klein
said comes up repeatedly is, “Are you re-
lated to the Druids?”

The Druids is a secret society on cam-
pus. Last spring, The Pitt News reported
that six members of the current Board
were involved in the society. The student
body spoke out against these members’
actions and cried that the situation dis-
played a lack of transparency.

Nites, who currently serves on the
Board, said it is typical to see low interest
in SGB after a particularly dramatic term,

which would explain the small number of -

candidates. 7

Benjamin said events such as the Druids
scandal made people distrust SGB, and it
left a bit of “saltiness” in students’ opin-
ions of the Board.

“The image of being on SGB is not ad-
vantageous right now,” Benjamin said. “It’s
not the public victory that it used to be.”

to pass future referenda. If this referendum
is passed, 3 percent of the student body, or
roughly 600 students, would have to vote
on future referenda. A simple majority of
301 votes would be needed in order pass.

The referendum also includes semantic
changes and the addition of sections outlin-
ing the Board’s purpose, which is included
in the preamble of the current SGB Con-
stitution.

This referendum also adds a section that
deﬁnes terms that appear in the document

and a section that explains the different

types of SGB committees and their roles,
structure and responsibilities.

Another referendum would decrease the
number of candidates for Board for whom
each student can vote from ﬁve candidates
to three.

An additional referendum would in-
crease the minimum GPA requirement for
Board members and the president from 2.5
to 2.75.

Students will decide today whether to
amend the SGB Constitution, current Board
members will decide next month whether
to amend SGB bylaws. ‘

Louderback said he and the Board mem-
bers began examining the Constitution and
bylaws during an SGB retreat last January.
Neither document has seen revision since
2011. Thejudicial Review Committee began
working on the changes at the beginning of
this semester, but Kozak said other judicial
obligations slowed down the committee
members’ work.

Kozak said thejudicial Review Commit-
tee members were each assigned to an inter-
nal committee. Half of the members began to
review the Board’s bylaws in September, and
the other half were free to handle potential
judicial complaints.

The Board will not vote on the bylaws
until its last public meeting on Dec. 3, and
the current Board will not be affected by the
proposed revisions. Since the decision will
affect incoming Board members, Kozak said
he and Louderback considered allowing next
year’s~Board to decide.

“Although nothing is a dramatic change

or controversial, they are still inﬂuencing ’

individuals who are coming in without
knowing [the revisions] fully before they
were running,” Kozak said.

Louderback said he did not think the

time frame should restrict the Board from

revising the Constitution. He added that if
the next Board disagrees with the changes,
future Board members can conduct their
own revisions.

“I think that it’s the Board’s prerogative
to put their opinions and thoughtsinto the
document,” Louderback said. “It’s a living
documen .” A

The majority of the proposed revisions‘

are semantic.

Kozak said the current Board members
already have the additional responsibilities,
but putting them into the bylaws will make
for a better transition between the current
Board members and their successors.

He also said that the proposed changes
to the bylaws would give prospective Board
candidates a better idea of what to expect if
they run for Board. Theseresponsibilities
include the addition of Section 2.03, which
states that Board members must attend
meetings for committees to which he or she
is appointed. These might include the Board
of Trustees or the University Senate Council.

Board members also act as liaisons for
the SGB committee chairs. Section 2.04,
another proposed addition, would require
each Board member to meet with the com-
mittee chair for whom he or she is a liaison
“once a month and as needed.”

Another proposed revision would move
Section 2 of the SGB Constitution into the

' Board’s bylaws. This section states that the

President and the three Board members who
receive the highest number of votes in the
election will serve as representatives to the
University Senate Council. A

Under the proposed change, these rules
would become sections 1.11 and 2.05 of the
bylaws. C

Kozak said his committee and the SGB
Constitutional Review Committee wanted to
move this section because the Constitution
is voted upon by the student body and is a
“way that students can help regulate how
they would like to see SGB run.” ’

Kozak.said his committee decided the,
section does not impact how the Board gov-
erns, which is why they recommended the
alternative placement.

Louderback agreed with Kozak’s reason-
ing.

“The Constitution is just a general out-
line, a skeleton of Student Government
Board’s role. The guts of the organization
should be in the bylaws,” Louderback said.

New Board must work to, improve
image among Pitt students

Rohith Palli»
Columnist

After a series of scandals last se-
mester, conﬁdence in Pitt’s Student

. Government Board, similar to Con-

gress, is extremely low. This is re-
ﬂected not only in the way people
discuss SGB, but also in the incred-
ibly low number of candidates for
elected positions. *

First, we discovered that former .

Elections Committee Chairwoman
Annie Brown did not pursue a ﬁﬂl
inquiry into accusations of cam-
paign infractions among the so-
called megaslates. Following the
proposal of a truce by Forbes slate
campaign manager Kate Malekoff,
Brown encouraged others to drop
all allegations and agree not to
make further accusations, saying
itwould bolsterthe “integrity of the
candidates and SGB as awhole.” On
her part, this was an understand-
able move. Untangling all of the
allegations would be nearly impos-
sible, and all the megaslates seemed
to have engaged in such behavior.
Unfortunately, an underlying as-
sumption here was that the results
of full inquiry into the allegation
would not affect independent can-
didates running for Board."

But this should have immedi-
ately raised the question of why
the megaslates engaged in such
behaviorto beginwith.Whywasn’t
our elections system more fair and

transparent?

We have come to expect dirty
campaigning, back~door deals and,
on occasion, Supreme Court med-
dling, in our U.S. presidential elec-
tions. But this is a college campus.

‘The university is a place of ideal-
ism where we strive for knowledge
and attempt to determine how we
should live our lives.

In such a place, the governing

body should reﬂect these ideals. -

' Student government should be the

best government. It should be ef-
ﬁciently run and reﬂect the will of
the students. But most importantly,

p it should be totally uncorrupted,

adhering to the highest possible
standards of ethics and morality.

If our elected officials c_an’t live
up to such hopes on a college cam-
pus, how can we possibly expect
this to hold in city- or state-wide
politics, much less national politics?
But six of the nine current Board
members, including SGB President
Gordon Louderback, are members
of the secret Druids organization on
campus, according to a report pub-
lished in The Pitt News last spring,
revealing that there is reason to be
skeptical of their motives in becom-
ing Board members.

Despite its rocky start, the cur-
rent Board has accomplished alot
this year. Notably, Academic Af-
fairs Chair Nuwan Perera and Board
member Thomasjabro started and
gained alarge number of signatures
onapetition to make OMET results
public. Though the logistics of such
a system are complicated, Perera
andjabro have demonstrated stu-
dent support for the tools to decide

onworthy classroom experiences.

Unfortunately, the opaque
"nature of last year’s election has
overshadowed the successes of this
year’s_ Board and has destroyed the
civics-building that campus poli-
tics once entailed. Running a clean,
competitive election, thinking on
one’s feet and thinking of innovative
ways to help the community used to
be hallmarks of a candidate’s expe-
rience. But after the revelations of
the Druids’ dominance of student
government at Pitt, it is clear that
this is not how the SGB elections
were run last year. This year, there
are so few candidates nmning that
the electionwill not provide the sort
of proving ground and practice for
professional politics that it should.

So how do we ﬁx this problem?

How do we restore conﬁdence
in the integrity of SGB? Clearly,
to restore conﬁdence, we must
eliminate the possibility of similar
scandals from occurring in the fu-
ture and create an Elections Code
representative of the wishes of the
Pitt student body..

To this end, one particular mod-
iﬁcation to the SGB constitution
must be accepted and augmented. A
referendum that students can vote
on duringthe Thursday election to
only allow students to have three
votes for Board seats, rather than
the current total of ﬁve per voter, is
a good step, but does not go nearly
far enough. Under the current sys-
tem, six friends can run for Board

, and president and have undue in-

ﬂuence over Student Government,
as the Druids did last year. Under
the new system, such a group could
only control at most three board
seats and the presidency.

But this, though not as dire a
situation, is not the ideal we should

- be striving for. We should be striv-
. ing for total elimination of the slate

system and decoupling of as many
candidates as possible. In a body
such as SGB, the goal shouldn’t be
to represent the majority perfectly,
but to gather as many student voic-
es as possible. By moving to three
votes, we will hopefully see awider
set of student voices represented
on the Board.

Limiting each student to one
vote would be even better. Here, we
would ideally see even more voices
represented by the Board, because
in this system, students will win on
small margins with small numbers
of votes. This will increase the value
of every vote for a Board seat and,
hopeﬁilly, increase voter tumout.
With SGB elections not typically
exceeding 25 percent turnout, this
would be an enormous change for

the better. Though each Board member would
have the support of a smaller proportion of
the student body, the Board as awhole would
be elected and supported by a much bigger,
more diverse electorate.

So today on the my.pitt portal, you may
not have a choice for SGB president, but you
do have a choice to make everlasting irnprove—
ments to our student government. Q

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor:

As students committed to engaging ques-
tions about authentic romance, Off the Hook
respectﬁilly disagrees with a portion of last
week’s Best Places Edition. You assert “the
urge [to hookup] needs to be celebrated” and
you encourage us to “go at it” at Mi Ranchito.
You presume this “urge gets to all of us,” but
what about those of us who don’t have an
untamed urge to hook up? What about those
who don’t give in to their every urge, instead

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT

 
 

Exhibitatthe

Allison Latzko
For The Pitt News

There’s always been something appeal-
ing and unnerving about an imperson-
ator.

The ability of an Elvis or, more re-
cently, Michael Jackson look-alike to
mimic the iconic aspects of a person
down to the most minute detail is an
entertaining thrill, but the efﬁcient dis-
tillation of what made those celebrities
so beloved is somewhat eerie.‘

Such is the case with Yasumasa
Morimura’s Theater of the Self. His
works utilize the same surreal skill of
the impersonator to put a new face —
his own —- on some of Western culture’s
most famed images.

As soon as the elevator to the seventh
ﬂoor opens, visitors of the Andy Warhol

Museum are immediately introduced to
overwhelmingly large works that are
bothunusual and intriguing. Famous
pieces from Western history that were
once familiar have been restaged piece-
by—piece, and they now bear the face of
Morimura. '

Including photographs, paintings
and digital video, Morimura’s exhibit
is located on the top ﬂoor of the museum
through Jan. 12, 2014. It’s held in two
rooms ﬁlled with enormous images of
20th-century ﬁgures such as Hitler and
Einstein and works of art such as"‘Mona
Lisa” and “Olympia.” »

In every single work, Morimura is the
subject. When there is more than one
subject, he represents them all.

This is the startling signature of
Morimura’s work. With a career span-
ning 30 years, the artist has produced

Vv/V ---e----u----I-----q--Q---:uq.;.....,..__,,_

many different forms of the self—por-

trait using multiple mediums. During a
lecture by the artist at the ‘McConomy
Auditorium on Oct. 3, Morimura said
that his portraits are a way to “expose
his own face and body to many people.”
This unique style was birthed in the
’8os, when he quit making Japanese
wood-block printsand began to work
on self-portraits. Through reproduc-
tions inrbooks and- articles, Morimura
learned about Western and European
artforms and how to reproduce them.
His work with the images of famous
ﬁgures such as Elvis and Marilyn Mon-
roe have closely connected him to Andy
Warhol, and he’s even called himself
Warhol’s “conceptual son.” The differ-
ence between his and Warhol’s work,
however, is that instead of just reproduc-
ing the same images with a new spin,

“ .Mlor'i'muralbl‘i|lianllyilirniliifes "our most me-molrable photos. Courtesy of The Andy Warhol Museum

arhoiputsanewfaceoniconicart

Morimura becomes these iconic ﬁgures.
He recreates the entire scene, mirroring
the lighting, postures and style of the
original works.

‘fl think with a lot of the works there
is this recognition that takes place, be-
cause these are quite well-known imag-
es,” said Warhol Museum Milton Curator

'of,Art Nicholas Chambers, who worked

in close collaboration with Morimura to
exhibit pieces never beforefseen in the
United States.“_I think the effect allows
people to look at these images in a fresh

new way.” —

At the lecture, the artist explained . —

that his interest in self-portraits

stemmed from a sheltered childhood

and a conservative family. His parents
had found it hard to accept new things,

The ability of modern art to turn the
mundane into the intellectually en-
gaging has persisted since the fateful
day that Marcel Duchamp famously
scrawled “_R.Mutt” onto a urinal and
entered it into the 1917 exhibit for
New York’s Society of Independent
Artists. The work created an uproar
and brought a whole new element to
the question of what art actually ‘s.

Though British artist Martin Creed
has never passed off a urinal as a piece
of art, it’s not difficult to see some
parallels between Duchamp’s “ready—
mades” and some of Creed’s works,
such as the crumpled-up paper balls

sometimes found in his exhibits (for
one such piece, check the ﬁrst ﬂoor re-
stroom of the Frick Fine Arts building).
His works, which sometimes also fea-
ture audio and visual elements, make
use of isolation, size and placement
to give viewers a new look at everyday
‘items. I
As a part of Pitt’s Museum Studies
course, a class of Pitt students has tried
to capture this aspect of Creed’s art in
the University Art Gallery. Feel free
to peruse the exhibit and ponder the
nature of art yourself: The gallery is
free to the public and the exhibit runs

A case for cocktails, and a
guide to the old fashioned

John Lavanga
A€9°E Editor

Every weekend, hundreds of college stu-

' dents of legal drinking age make a run on

their local liquor store. With whatever mon-
ey they’ve managed to save up by skipping
meals, working somewhat humiliating-odd

V jobs or donating their  and 
’ to medical science, theypurchase ever
A bottom-sh'elfliq‘u’or they can get.their_ 

on and quickly go on their way (presumably

to consume said liquor).

If you’re among this particular group,
you’re doing it wrong. a

The problem with this “whatever’s on
sale” approach to liquor that so many of us

take is that we tend to get a pretty bad ﬁrst A

foray into the world ofspirits. If your only
experience with bourbon is taking vaguely
metallic-tasting shots of Evan Williams —
each one eliciting a teary—eyed wince as it
burns a path down your esophagus like an

Arizona forest ﬁre and hits your guts with V

the tendertouch of a Mike Tyson haymaker
because you’re plum out of Hawaiian Punch
to mix it down with — chances are you’re
not going to have very fond memories of
bourbon, or any liquor for that matter.
Through such experiences, many come

to believe that liquor is nothing more than '

an unpleasant and efficient route to a buzz.
As the venerable comedian Louis C.K. said,
we View that shot of whiskey as merely
“brown liquid that makes people feel dif-
ferently than if they didn’t drink it.”

 

In other words, liquor is an annoyance
that must be brieﬂy endured, or may alter-
natelyrbe drowned in a soft drink of choice
until it bears almost no resemblance to its
former self. V ‘

. Such a utilitarian interpretation of the
purpose and nature of spirits is gravely,
almost tragically, limited. By imagining li-
quor to be a troublesome means to a desir— —
able end, we frequently overlook a far more
elegant path to that same end. For only by
embracing the joys of liquor can we get the
mo st out ofevery ounce of that sweet, sweet

'- poison that we call booze.

This is the beauty of the cocktail.

At its core, any good cocktail is made
up of three essential ingredients: a spirit, a
bitter element and a sweeter element. The
latter two never overwhelm, but instead
accentuate the former, allowing its subtler
notes to come to the fore and ﬂourish.

It is this willingness to celebrate and
savor the liquor we drink that separates

- cocktails from mixed drinks. While one

is an attempt to mask the booze in ques-
tion, much like the Reagan mask Patrick
Swayze dons in “Point Break,” the other
tries to emphasize the ﬂavors of the alcohol,
smoothing them over like the ﬁnish on a

ﬁnely made piece of woodworking (or the

way Patrick Swayze’s golden tan accentu—
ates the curvature of his jawline in “Point

Break”).

10 years in, Barebones

Productions keeps things rolling

Vincent Smith
Staff Wrz’ter

Barebones Productions, a Pittsburgh theatre
company, has the humblest of humble origins.

Nearly a decade ago, Patrickjordan, the
artistic director and founder of Barebones,

V put on a play in the basement of a bowling

alley with nothing more than a power strip,
a desk and a chair. The sound ofbowling balls
rolling across the ﬂoor could be heard through
the ceiling. He paid forthe minimal expenses

‘ out of pocket.

Jordan expected ten to 15 people to show
up. Instead, nearly 80 people came.

“When this ﬁrst started, it was going to
be a one-off,” saidjordan. But after the initial
show of support,]ordan kept Barebones going.

On Thursday, Nov. 21, the company will de-
but its latest performance, “The Motherf"‘*ker
with the Hat,” a play written by Stephen Guir-
gis. The performance will be held at the New
Hazlett Theater and will run through Dec. 7.

This is the second play by Guirgis that
Barebones has performed, and it marks an-
other installment of modern, hard—hitting
plays that have come to characterize Bare-
bones’ style.

Just like the ﬁrst play that Barebones per-
formed back in 2003 — “Bash” written by
Neil La.Bute — “The Motherf”"*ker with the
Hat” has never been performed in Pittsburgh
before.Jordan saw a trend of newer plays be-
ing passed up to make roomforthe old staples.

“There is an amazing amount of play-
wrights that weren’t getting any play in [the
city], and everybody was j ust doing the same
kind of theater,”Jordan said.

So in response, Barebones made sure that
they would bring a new type of theater for a
new type of crowd.

“We try to attract newer and younger au-
diences by doing plays that my friends and I

‘would have wanted to go see,” he said.

“The Motherf“‘*ker with the Hat” imme~
diately grabs attention with the expletive in
the name. The play itself is just as physical and
emotional as the title implies.

There is also somethingvery special about
this upcoming performance. “For the ﬁrst
time ever, we are going to have an actual set
with this show,” said Jordan. Although this
set is simplistic, Barebones has clearly come
alongway since performing in bowling alleys.

The play follows the story of Jackie -
played byjordan —— who is released from jail
andgreunited with his girlfriend, Veronica,

played by Ruth Gamble. After the initial jubila-
tion over]ackie’s return, things turn sour when
he ﬁnds another man’s hat in their ‘apartment.
The story then follows the troubles of addic-
tion, love and inner- city life.

The play is one that resonates with audi-
ences due to its setting and its believability.
Although “we may not all be addicted to coke
[like Veronica], we all have little addictions,”
Gamble said.

When asked about her character, Gamble
laughs at how brash and crude Veronica is
perceived. But for Gamble, the character is
much more than someone who spouts a con-
siderable number of F-bombs. “To me, she’s
an idealist, and she has a huge heart,” she
said, adding with a laugh that Veronica is also
pretty “ballsy.” ‘

Director Rich Keitel believes that the play
is relatable because everyone knows some-
one who talks the way the characters in “The
Motherf"‘*ker with the Hat” do. “They are
not characters far removed from the world,”
Keitel said. They are not “dressed up in suits
or ruffles from the Restoration Period.”

Considering that they started without an
advertising budget, Jordan believes that the
consistent crowds Barebones is able to bring
in to see performances are a mark of dedica-
tion to the actors’ craft. By bringing a unique
twist to the theater, Barebones has shown
that it ﬁlls a unique niche" and that rougher
theater is, in the words ofjordan, “commer-
cially viable.”

“I’d like to think that people show up to
this show because after 10 years, we have a
brand, and there is quality to it,”Jordan said.

OLD FASHION-A )

tails should begin with the old fashioned.
Originally a product of the 19th century,
the old fashioned is aiclassic American
cocktail that typically showcases one of

I the two quintessentially American spirits:

bourbon or rye.

For anyone familiar with the acclaimed
TV show “Mad Men,” the name “old fash-
ioned” likely conjures an image of Don
Draper in a sharp blue suit muddling a
cherry and ﬂoating an orange wedge over
a couple shots of bourbon as he sm_ooth
talks his way into or out of a jam,

However, according to Craig Mrusek, a
cocktail expert and bartender at Lawrencev—
ille’s Tender Bar and Kitchen, Draper’s ver-
sion of the old fashioned is a mid-20th-
century bastardization of the drink. The
original version of the old fashioned took a
far more minimalist approach to things. It
consisted simply of whiskey, bitters (which
Mrusek said provides an element of so-
phistication to the drink that keeps it from
becoming nothing but sweetened whiskey),
and sugar served over one large shard of ice.

However, “around the middle of the last

century, in the ’4os and ’5os, people started

messing around with it,” Mrusek said.
This “messing around” consisted of us-

ing muddled fruit and excessive sugar to '

transform a stiff, rather straight-forward
drink into what Mrusek called an “alco-
holic fruit salad” of sorts. Though many
embrace this somewhat indulgent, modern
revisioning of the old fashioned, Mrusek

, is an advocate of the classic approach, the

simplicity of which “embodies that late 19th
century [aesthetic] .”

In a city like Pittsburgh, where the iron-
and steel—forged legacies of 19th century in-
dustrialists reverberate through the town’s
very core, this feels like a ﬁtting choice.

As stated previously, the whiskey itself is
the most important element of the old fash-
ioned. With this in mind, Mrusek laid out
the primary differences between bourbon
and rye whiskeys. To be legally considered
a bourbon, the mash for the whiskey in
question must be comprised of at least 51
percent corn, and be aged in charred oak
barrels for a minimum of two years, while
rye whiskeys must be made from a mash
that is, wait for it, 51 percent rye grains,

i also in charred oak barrels. T if  f -

Though the other 49 Percent ofthernash
allows forimmense latitude in terms of
ﬂavor, bourbons tend to carry sweeter

notes such as vanilla or honey, while ryes. "

are typically more peppery, withia far more
immediate burn.

These elements certainly came through
when comparing the two varieties. An old
fashioned made with Bulleit bourbon and
garnished with a slice of orange rind carried
a toasted ﬂavor, with notes of honey and

an element of citrus that came from both
the bitters and the garnish. Despite being
almost—entirely alcohol (an old fashioned is
traditionally made with 2 shots of whiskey),
there was no burn to speak of, and the af-
tertaste was warm and lingering.

The old fashioned made with Michter’s
rye, by contrast, announced its presence 21
bit more forcefully. The very slightly pep-
pery burn after,the initial sip tickled the
back of my mouth slightly, but didn’t clash
with the brown sugar notes that it offered
up at ﬁrst.

What was most striking about each ‘

of these beverages was the way that the
traditional whiskey burn is muted by the
addition of a few simple ingredients, al-
lowing the taster to ponder the whiskey,
rather than gulp it down like some sort of
foul medication for one’s existential ills
(though that probably happens with old
fashioneds, as well).

Included on page 10 is a basic recipe for

an old-style old fashioned, but as Mrusek_
noted, “There’s no big stone tablet some— ’

where that has the canonical recipe” for
cocktails, so feel free to add a bit of vari-

and their fear for his safety kept him from
doing anything outside of his home.

“The only place I could breathe was
in my imagination. I created stories and
I would be the main character — by my-
self,” Morimura said.“This is the basis for
my self-portraits.”

The exhibition is broken into three
distinct categories that look back on his
extensive career of self—portraits: “Re-

Iquiem,” “Art History”and “Actresses.”

.The largest room of the exhibit holds
the “Requiem” and “Art History” series,
which are representations of important
scenes from history and re—workings
of famous paintings. The large scale of
these works allows viewers to see every
detail that Morimura restaged and imi-
tated. His use of traditional and digital
art forms also creates a diverse range of
self—portraits, which keep his reimagining
fresh and interesting.

The smaller section of the exhibition
holds the “Actresses” series. These far

5 smaller works represent iconic scenes

from ﬁlms starring actresses such as Au-

actress and restages the same scene in
black—and—white photographs. While not
as grand, there are many of these images,
and Morimura’s focus is on the subject,
rather than the whole scene. .

The Warhol Museum’s exhibition of
Morimura’s work isn’t just a rare spectacle
for viewers —— it’s also a novel exhibit for
the artist himself.

“This particular exhibition is inter-

esting because it’s the ﬁrst time these 0

three have occupied the same space,” said

Charles Exley, assistant professor of mod-

ern Japanese literature and ﬁlm at Pitt.
“In a way, they’re all sort of talking to

I

Parity music irom

each other,” he said.

Exley also discussed Morimura’s work
in relation to Japanese N oh and Kabuki
Theater, which emphasize learning by
imitation or impersonation.

By becoming, acting or imitating an-
other character and seeing things in a
different light, one can learn more about
oneself. In this way, Morimura is learning
more about himself every time he imper-
sonates someone or something else. He
is “adopting” a new point of view.

“Finding a single truth (to who you
are) is impossible,” said Morimura.

Morimura’s art blends gender identity,

the i9iii CE§iiliJi”y’.

art history, beauty and popular culture
into what he calls a “beautiful commo-
tion.” His works are homages to famous
pieces of art, and they can be accessible
and engaging to anyone who has seen
the original works before. By altering
something as simple as a face or a body,
the image, no matter how old it is, can
take on new life and- meaning.

“Usually, self—portraits say, “‘This is
the real, only me,”’ Morimura said. “But
for me, it is the opposite. There are many
‘me’s reﬂected in my works'.” I

Pitt Head Coach Jamie Dixon took a
unique first stab into his bench reserves

Wednesday night during Pitt’s 77-58

rout of Lehigh.

Rather than pointing to sharpshoot-
ing redshirt sophomore ~Durand.J‘ohn-
son, Dixon elected to use true freshman
point guard Josh Newkirk. The move

appeared to act as a spark plug forJohn- ’

son, who took his warm-ups off minutes
later and ended up setting career highs
in several categories.

The 6—foot-6 swingman ﬁnished '

the game with 15 points, going 5-for-8
from behind the 3-point line with five
rebounds and a steal. ’

Last night’s scoring performance
marks Johnson’s career highs in points
and field goals made. Dixon hasn’t seen
such an offensive outburst fromJohn-
son since Jan. 16 at Villanova, when
Johnson tied former Panther Trey Zei-
gler with a game—high 13 points.

When it came time for comment,
however, Dixon did not speak ofJohn-
son’s offensive production, but rather
his other tools of play.

“The big thing about Durand is that
he’s doing other things,” Dixon said.
“He had five rebounds and he made
a couple of nice passes. I thought his
defense, after a slow start, has looked
better, as well.”

All ofJohnson’s points came outside
the 3-point line on catch-and-shoot op-
portunities.

“In all those cases, it’s a guy mak-
ing an extra pass and him being in the
right spot and knocking down the shot,”
Dixon said. “I think our execution was

while and he pretty much told me he was

going to be on tonight,” said Robinson.‘

“He’s a scorer. Tonight he really showed
that he could score.”

To the surprise of many, Lehigh Head
Coach Brett Reed said Johnson was a
primary focus" of the Mountain Hawks’
scouting report.

“Johnson was the one guy we did not
want to let go on the perimeter,” Reed
said. “[Tonight], he demonstrated the
type of offensive outburst he had.”

For now, Johnson will have to get
used to coming offthe bench and reliev-
ing fifth—year senior Lamar Patterson
and junior Cameron Wright. At times,
this can be tough for Johnson if an im-
mediate rhythm is not found.

Johnson said that he was not quite

feeling his shot on Sunday when the

Panthers hosted Howard.

“I felt bad last game, so I got in the
gym and got up more shots,” Johnson
said. “I realized I wasn’tjumping on my
shots, I wasn’tjumping on my release. I
came out tonight with more confidence
and came out shot-ready.”

Johnson is still becoming comfort-
able with his role, and whatever that
role is, Johnson said he always takes
the same approach.

“Coach Dixon is going to do what
he’s going to do,”Johnson said. “When
your name is called, just be ready. It
doesn’t matter if I’m the sixth man off
the bench, the seventh, eighth or ninth.

Pitt levies 77-
58 beatdown
on‘ Lehigh

Dan Sostek
Staff Wrz'ter

The last phrase anyone would use to
describe redshirt sophomore Durand
Johnson would be gun—shy. On Wednes-
day night, his trigger-happy offensive
mindset was on full display.

The Baltimore native hit ﬁve heavily
contested 3-point shots in the first half,
finishing with 15 points off the bench
and propelling the Panthers to a 77-58
win over the Lehigh Mountain Hawks
in their second game of the Progressive
Legends Classic. _

_ “Durand told me he was going to be on
tonight,” sophomore point guard James
Robinson said. “Once he hit that first
three, I knew he was going to be hot. I
just kept giving him the ball and he kept
coming through.”

Johnson cited his poor showings in
the past few games as a motivator for his
breakout performance.

“Last game, I felt bad. I felt down
on myself,” said Johnson, who was just
1-for-7 from beyond the arc in his past
two games. “Tonight, I wanted to come
out and be confident, be shot-ready. My
teammates found me and I was able to
knock down shots.”

_The 6—foot-6 guard cited working in
the gym and fine tuning his shot as a
catalyst for the turnaround.

“I wasn’t jumping on my jumpshot,”
Johnson said. “I wasn’t jumping on my
release.”

Johnson’s five triples — a career high
— marked the turning point of the game
for the Panthers, but the team received
sizeable contributions from other play-
ers, as well.

Panthers set to host Maryland, NC State in Weekend matches

Caitlin Hinsey
Stcyj‘ W riter

The Pitt women’s volleyball team begins
to wrap up its ﬁrst season in the ACC this
weekend with two matches against con-
ference opponents, taking on Maryland
Friday and North Carolina State Sunday,
in their ﬁnal two matches of 2013 at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

Pitt is currently on a two—game win-

ning streak and has won three of its last

four games. This is a major change for the
Panthers, who had previously lost ﬁve
consecutive matches before their recent
winning streak. ‘

During that ﬁve-game losing streak,
the Panthers lost to both Maryland and
North Carolina State in close matches, and
they are looking to redeem themselves
at home. 1

“We lost to both of them in really
close games, so we are looking for some
vengeance,” redshirt freshman middle
blocker Jenna Potts said. “It’1l be really
tough matches.”

Despite the threatening weekend op-
ponents, the Panthers (15-14, 7-9 ACC)
hope to keep the momentum goingfrom
their two—game streak and ﬁnish their
season on a strong note. .

In its ﬁrst game of the weekend 0
Friday night, Pitt will face a Maryland
team that has struggled withwinning ACC
conference games, especially on the road.
The Terps (13-15, 5-11 ACC) have lost their

last two games, which were both away.
Maryland also has only captured one
road win all season, going 1-8 away from
College Park, Md. .
The ﬁrst meeting between the Panthers
and the Terps took place a little more than
three weeks ago,_ and it was a back-and-

forth affair. Three of the four matches .

between the teams were decided by two
points, and Pitt stole a match win.

Pitt played strong throughout those
matches and ‘mounted comebacks, but
the Panthers struggled to maintain leads
and eventually lost 3-1.

Pitt felt as if its ﬁrst game against-

Maryland slipped away, which is simi-
lar to the team’s feelings about its ﬁrst
match against NC State (20-8, 11-5 ACC)
this season.

When Pitt faced NC State in the teams’

ﬁrst contest, the Panthers lost to the Wolf-
pack, 3-2. Although the ﬁrst two matches
were close in score, Pitt and NC State each
won a match decisively before Pitt lost a
close ﬁfth set.

Pitt’s offense played great in this game,
as well. Three Panthers ﬁnished with
double-ﬁgure kills, and sophomore set-

I just want to come out and play hard.”
Johnson averaged 11.9 points per
game off the bench in the 2012-2013
season. As a freshman, he did what was
asked by his coaching staff as a pure
shooting guard and shot 38 percent
from beyond the arc. s

Despite these numbers, Robinson
saidjohnson was not able to expose his
true capabilities.

‘iIt’s great to know when Durand
comes in, he’s going to bring energy
and enthusiasm,” Robinson said. “I
think Durand is much more of a com-

   

plete player than just a scorer. He brings
energy and he’s athletic. He’s a [much]
better passer now. He brings a lot more
to the team than just scoring. He’s com-
ing offthe bench now and really being
productive.”

In front ofjohnson, Patterson start-
ed his 70th consecutive game as a Pan-
ther last night. Patterson, now in his
third year as Pitt’s.starting small for-
ward, collected 17 points and chalked
up ﬁve rebounds and four assists.

Dixon said Patterson’s experience
does not take long to reveal itself.

“It starts with Lamar,” Dixon said

' of Patterson’s instant impact. “I think 
every game, we’ve had Lamar getting ' H
other guys shots to start the game, 

— Monday. g

showing unselfishness. I know we’re
a program who’s known for it, having
unselﬁsh players year-in and year—out.
Tonight was great evidence of that.”
Patterson and the Panthers will
take on their toughest competition of
the season yet when they travel to the

Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., to"

continue play in the Progressive Leg-
ends Classic. Pitt will face Texas Tech
(3-1) — a Tubby Smith-led team that
relies’ heavily on a 2-3 zone on defense

BASKETBALL

raiib zaiiné posted a double-double with 23 points and 14 rebounds Wednesday.

Bobby Mizia [Visual Editor

double-double of his career, totaling
a career—best 23 points — while going
9—for—1O on ﬁeld goals —— to go along
with 14 rebounds.

The senior center from Nigeria was
aggressive from the start, something that
he cited as a major focus for improve-
ment this offseason. That aggressive
attitude was displayed front and center
early on, as Zanna tallied eight of the
team’s ﬁrst 12 points.

“We talked about how they were going
to guard the ball screens, and thought
[Talib] would be open,” head coach ja-
mie Dixon said.n“It’s really good to see
him play well. It’s been pretty consistent
every night out.”

James Robinson contributed with 11
assists, a new career high for the sopho-
more, while posting a zero in the turn-

overs column. Dixon was very impressed ‘

by the young guard’s unselﬁshness.
“We’re up big numbers and [James] is

still not looking for his,” said Dixon, who
compiled win N 0. 266 of his head coach-
ing career Wednesday. “That’s pretty
consistent with Pitt basketball.”

The Panthers’ victory came over a Le-
high program that has won 20 or more
games the past two seasons, but is re-
cuperating after losing a few starters.

The biggest loss was guard C.]. McCol-

lum, who was drafted in the first round
of the NBA draft by the Portland Trail
Blazers (two picks ahead of former Pitt
center Steven Adams). The teams met
last year, with Pitt winning that contest
78-53. —
After the loss, Lehigh head coach Brett
Reed was complimentary of the Panthers,
stating that, “They have a physical pres-
ence to them.” When asked about how his
team prepared to defend Pitt’s offense,
Reed boiled it down to one player.

Olfensively, the Panthers have per- .

formed well throughout the season, but
they struggle to maintain a lead, which
has cost them games. Head coach Dan

Fisher is choosing to stick to his main V

lineup throughout these up—and-down '

games, which paid dividends in a ﬁve-set A: ‘

win against Boston College. _
“We decidedto stay with the team that’s
been playing pretty good in the past couple
ofweeks, and it paid off,” Fisher said.
Pitt looks to continue to play well of-
fensively in its next two games. Though
the Panthers will rely on the entire team
to hit well, Pitt hopes that junior outside
hitterjessica Wynn and redshirt freshman
middle blocker KeKe Irby will continue to
play well. . . '
Fisher also would like to see both of his
outside hitters — senior Monica Wignot
and freshman Maria Genitsaridi —— get
past the struggles they endured against
Boston College. , A
' Pitt has played great on defense, thanks
to junior libero Delaney Clesen, but will
face hard—hitting players throughout the
weekend. In their ﬁrst match, Clesen and
the Panthers will need to stop senior out-
side hitter Mary Cushman and junior mid-
dle blocker Adreene Elliott for Maryland.

Against NC State, Pitt will need to watch
out for the Wolfpack’s best player, junior
outside hitter Dariyan Hopper. Hopper
leads her team in kills with 321.

“We’re looking forward to getting some
wins,” Fisher said. “The girls are very mo-
tivated. We have won three of the last four,
so we are feeling pretty good.”

“Johnson was the one guy that we
didn’t want to let go on the perimeter,”
said Reed, currently in his seventh year
as the Mountain Hawks’ head coach. “He
did an excellent job.”

Defensively, the Panthers held Le-
high’s star senior guard, Mackey McK-
night, to eight points on 4-for—1o shoot-
ing, while the Mountain Lions shot 44.7
percent from the field. The,Mountain
Hawks were led in scoring by freshman

 

center Tim Kempton —— son of the NBA
player of the same name —— who had 20
points on 7—of-10 shooting.

Where Pitt truly dominated, in large
part thanks to Zanria’s contributions,
was on the glass. The Panthers out-re-
bounded Lehigh by an astounding 44-
to—21 margin and hauled in 17 offensive
boards.

Lamar Patterson, making his 70th
consecutive start, once again filled up
the box score. The redshirt senior put

up 17 points, 5 rebounds and 4 assists _

while knocking down a trio of threes.

17

True freshman Jamel Artis pitched in
with seven points — including the first
three—pointer of his collegiate career
-— and three rebounds in 20 minutes
of action.

The Panthers are now 4-0 on the sea-
son, winning each of their games by mar-
gins of 19 points or more. After winning
their ﬁrst two games in the Progressive
Legends Classic, the Panthers head to
Brooklyn, N.Y., to face Texas Tech in
the second leg of the invitational. The
game will take place at 7:30 p.m. at the
Barclays Center Monday. is
