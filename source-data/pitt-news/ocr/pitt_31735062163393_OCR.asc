 Blanket two-thirty curfews have been granted by Hous-
' mg Board to all women living on campus for the Friday
night activities. Saturday night curfews, however, remains

at 1:30 a.m.

“A girl can always use one of her two special permissions
to stay out till 2:30 if she wishes,” explained Faith Leitzel,
chairman of Housing Board. “That’s what‘ they're for.” If
representatives to the Housing Board receive a greatdeal-of
protest from the women in the dorms, however, the matter

will ',robably be brought up againO

for discussion, she indicated.

Walter Judd
Midday Guest 4
Wednesday 

Dr. Walter Judd, the man who
delivered the ﬁery keynote speech
at. the Republican National Con-
vention in 1960, will speak at the
SU Midday Series Wednesday,

His topic will be “How are we
doing in our world relations?”

Judd, who served ten terms in
Congress as a representative from
Minnesota, is a distinguished
authority on foreign affairs.

He is one‘ of the relatively few
Americans who can speak with
personal knowledge of happenings
in the Far East. He lived in China
for ten years in areas that were
controlled by the Communists as
far back as 1930. Judd, a medical
doctor, worked as a medical mis-
sionary there.

Most Influential

Fellow congressmen in’ 1962
voted Judd one of the House’s ﬁve
most inﬂuential members. He was

the only Republican named. “The

New York Times” said that one
of Judd’s greatest assets is “his
reputation for absolute integrity.”
This was proven when his fel-
low Republicans in the House
selected him as the Congressman
they “most admired.”

Judd, a Phi Beta Kappa, work-
ed his way through the University
of Nebraska and its medical school
withpdd jobs as dishwasher, cafe-

teria manager, night telephone op-

erator in a hospital, musician in
a band on ‘summer Chautauga

Student Newspaper Policy

Gussie Smith Leads
Assault on ‘Pitt News’

By PAT POLLING"

Student Government will conduct an investi-
gation of complaints received from various Uni-
versity organizations “who are being ignored” by
The Pitt News, according to SG vice president
Carroll “Gussie” Smith.‘

Miss Smith, whose ﬂaming oratory at last
week's SG meeting labeled The Pitt News as “a
detriment to the University” emphatically outlined
her’ stand. .

“It is the responsibility of the newspaper to
present an accurate picture of the persons it writes
about. If a column is slanted unjustly, it puts a
person (or group) in a light that's untrue."

. “Blind Attacks” '

Miss Smith accused the paper of issuing “blind
attacks.” She stated that students-are getting a
wrong image of the University.

“Is the paper being published for a journal-
ism award, or is it being‘ published for the ‘stu-
dents?” she asked.

v The SG veep declared a change is needed in
the “one-sided philosophy generating from The
Pitt News. i

“For instance,” she noted, “the paper is always
knocking the Greeks. Yet when they do something
worthy, no mention is made of it. How many other
newsworthy articles don’t make the paper?”

According to Miss Smith, it would be a good
idea for the newspaper to explain its functions to
the students. Her verbal attack, which was admit-
tedly one-sided (“it had to »be”), has won the
support of SG members. -

Landy Named to

  Publications Board

Student Government President Martin Landy,
has been appointed to the Publications Board by

A Dr. Alan C. Rankin, vice-chancellor of student;

and general affairs.

The Publications Board ‘approves editorial ap- -

pointments and reviews complaints arising about‘
student publications. It previously consisted of
nine faculty and administration members and two‘
students.- _;_
Appointed following his. own ,suggestion,
Landy fee1s_he can serve three functions. He can
reveal the viewpoint of a student leader in-critical’
appraisal of publications. As a student he can have‘
a more personal relationship with the members
of the staﬁs than can other Board members. He
plans also to lookout for the interests of students P
and of the publications. _ '
Where student interest is concerned, SG should
be involved, Landy explained. '
Director of Student Publications Irving N.
Rothman, remarked about the appointment, “It
seems that ‘Student Government has waited" too
long to show a realistic interest in the publica-
tions scene. P ' ‘
Representing Pi Delta Epsilon, honorary journ-

alism fraternity, on the Board, Stan Stein, as-

sociate editor of the The Pitt News, commented,
“I _don’t know exactly how Landy wangled that
position, but he has no more business on the“
Publications Board than Richard Nixon. If he
feels that he, Gussie Smith, or SG can dictate Pitt
News policy, he is sorely mistaken.”

‘Election Day Minus One’ Topic For Forumi

“Election Day Minus One” is the
topic of the Student Union Forum
Series program scheduled for
Monday at 3 p.m. Taking the form
of a political debate, the program
will take place in the SU Supper
Room. ‘

James Malone, a Republican and
president of the Pennsylvania

_Manufacturers, and James Knox, a

Democrat and Comptroller of A1-
legheny County, will debate the
question of domestic economic
problems and labor and unemploy-

his as. candibhte far re-.

election in Tuesday’s voting.

“This program was included in‘
the forum series because it forms
a vital part in our project to make
the students more aware of the
world around them and to provide
an open platform of views and
opinions,” said Mike Marcuse,
chairman of the Forum Series.

Smaller Scale Debate

The debate will be similar to
the Nixon-Kennedy debates only
on a smaller scale, according to
Marcuse. There ‘will be a question

“This program should be of
interest to all students since it
is the day before elections, since
one of the candidates is speak-
ing, and since we are discussing
a problem of importance in ev-
ery election,” Marcuse said.

Malone has had much publicity
since a recent television debate
where he made some startling
comments regarding unemploy-
ment, according to Marcuse. “He
has an unusual philosophy regard-

Diplomat Lall Reveals Little

Praise U.N..
For Dynamism

He is a polished diplomat and
an expert in international affairs,
but for all his expertise Arthur
Lall, last Friday, told very few
Midday Series listeners very lit-
tle about the United_Nations.

The former consul-general of
India‘ explained that with wisdom
and good sense the United Na-
tions is expanding beyond its
narrow charter in order to meet
the requirements of an atomic age
for peace and cooperation. It is
not shrivelling up in its’ big glass
mansion" on the East River. It
is dynamic.

Too bad that the same can not _

be said about Lall’s audience —

or rather the University com- _

munity from which his audience
should have been drawn.

7 Perhaps Lall was justiﬁed in

painting colorful generalizations
and feeding pablum specifics
about intricate problems and
functionings of the United Na-
tions to a University community
which produced an audience of
fewer than 100 interested in the

‘At Home At Pitt’
Set For Monday

Dr. Fernando Bertolini, profes-
sor of mathematics, is host for
the third “At Home At Pitt” pro-
gram, in his home, Monday at
8:30 p.m.

Sponsored by the YWCA, the
program is “designed to increase
informal communication between
students of varied backgrounds
and cultures and the fascinating
professors composing the Pitt
faculty,” according to Chairman
Mary Ann Marrazzi.

For the‘ discussion, Dr. —Berto-
lini has requested open questions
in mathematics. Suggestions may
be sent along with acceptance to
the YWCA office, 518 SU, ext.
325 by November 1. Students
should specify whether they need
transportation or can provide it
and include their academic ma-
jor and math background.

Few Listeners
Show Interest

Congo. The role of the U.N. there
was “spectacular.” Although it
did interfere in internal affairs,
Lall rejoiced that it did so in or-
der to stop a much more dan-
gerous interference from other
countries that would have" split
the country apart.

Other actions Ahe ‘commended

included the “calm, reasoned
voice of U Thant” in the Cuban
crisis, the restoration‘ of the bal-

ance of power in the sultanstate_

of Oman, the recommendation to
the Union of South Africa to dis-
continue apartheid, and the tem-

-porary governing of an island in

the Paciﬁc in order to prevent
local war before that island, was
transferred to Indonesia. Local
conﬂicts often .expand, he ex-
plained.

Although concern with disarm-
ament is another area in which
the U.N. has expanded, it has
lagged in the establishment of a
permanent police force. “Neither
decadent not shrivelled,” how-
ever, the U.N. is capable of
“growing into the requirements,”
even if the audience was not.

By BILL NIEDERBERGER

CHRIS CONN'OR—Free
Spirits; Atlantic 8061; “Jump for

 

Joy,” “Nightbird,” “Milano,”
“Opportunity Please Knock,”

-“Day. Dream,” “Things are
S w i n g in’,” “Kansas City,”
“Lonely _Woman,” “I’m Gonna
Go Fishin’,” “God Bless The
Child,” “Free Spirits.”

At ﬁrst glance, this collection of
compositions of famous jazz writ-
ers would seem to have the ingre-
dientsneeded for success: a ﬁrst-
rate singer, proven compositions
and a group of top musicians for
backing. , Yet the performance
seldom gets above the mediocre
level.

Miss Connor, ever—improving,is
blameless. Obviously the writers
are not responsible. And the mu-
sicians——Clark Terry, Phil Woods,
Oliver Nelson, Dave Bailey, et al
—would not-be guilty.

Real Culprit

The real culprit here is the idea
of bringing musicians together to
sight—read and record in one ses-
sion, this -being a matter of eco-
nomics for the record companies.
They must hire musicians on a
one-time basis only.

This policy compels a mech-
anical sound and acéunts for the
mediocrity of this album. For
instance, Terry’s solo intro of_
“Child”. sounds like nothing
more than -a stage musician run-
ning through an intro at an au-
d i ti o n mechanical
schmaltzy.

Miss Connor seems to be perma-
nently aiflicted with a backing
problem. Previous unsympathetic
work by the ‘Maynard Ferguson
orchestra on two releases comes to
mind. That she has remained un-
touched by the surrounding medi-.
ocrity is a tribute to her talent (or
fortitude). Miss Connor‘ here, as
always, shows careful control of

her husky voice with ﬁne diction
and discreet use of vibrato.

More Polished Singer
Her skill with ballads is appa-

and “Woman.” And more.surpris-
ing is her ease on faster tempos,
with good performances on “Joy,”
“Nightbird” and “Things.” Miss
Connor is more polished than ever
and deserves a serious hearing,
especially from those who have
disliked her style ‘in the past. She
rates at the top of the list of jazz
singers.

Al Cohn, who arranged the
set, hits both extremes. His
writing can be tasteful as in
“Nightbird,” a. moody but
swinging track, and can be un-
believably bad as in “Fishing’,"
done in the same old formula -—
fast three-quarter time with
brass riffs.

and deserving of better treatment
by Atlantic Records. If the com-
pany will give her decent backing
and recording, jazz fans will ac-
cept her one of these days for
what she really is —- an unusually
‘good jazz singer.

 International Program

Called ‘Pioneer Step’

Last week’s International Week
program, co-sponsored by the Stu-
dent Union Board and the Inter-
national Student’s Committee, was
a “pioneer step in promoting in-
ternational awareness through an
exchange of ideas and culture,”

' according to Bhasi Nayar, co-

chairman of the ISC.

Nayar pointed out that Mayor
Barr, The Pittsburgh Council for

International Visitors, The United‘

Nations Association of Pittsburgh
and all administrative ofﬁces con-
cerned “cooperated fully to pro-
mote the success of the program.”
He stressed the fact that the pro-
gram was aimed not only at stu-
dents, but the people of Pittsburgh
in ‘general. ’
University Initiated

He also noted that while the

University is taking the initiative

in the program, mainly because

_,c.\_‘

the University has such a large
number of foreign students, the
program has as one of its pur-
poses to unite the international in-
terests of students at all the area
universities and colleges, and to
arouse the interest of the general
public in this respect.

He addedthat ‘tthis is very .

important in View of the in-
creasing role of the University
as a center of learning to people
abroad. If the tempo of the In-
ternational Week is_maintained

ab1'oad.’f He noted that this pro-
gram has already taken an ac-
tive step in that direction.

According tp Joan Gelfond, co-
chairman of the committee, one of
the problems faced during the ﬁrst
attempt at the type of program
was obtaining active participation
from students. f‘While the re-
sponse to the social aspects of the
program was wonderful, we were
disappointed in the amount of peo-
ple who turned out for its intel-
lectual endeavors.”

Forum Series

She was refering to the Forum
Series on the American Image,
and others of similar nature, and
stated that this program “was very
valuable because it makes any
American listening aware of the
attitude abroad toward America.”

Co-chairman Nayer. said that
the committee was very pleased
with the success of this initial step
in cultural exchange, and Miss
Gelfond pointed out that the Uni-
versity had alloted a budget to the
committee, which on the basis -of
this yearis success might be in-
creased.

She added, “We ‘hope to grow,
but we need more active people.”
With hespect to what type of
growth the committee aspired to,
Miss Gelfond said, “We need both
suggestions and people to carry
out the ideas. This is an opportu-
nity for interested students to take
an active part.”

In The Spotlight

with Stan Schweiger

Sir Carol Reed has discovered a formula in dealing with
the motion picture that offers something to the viewer with
each new ﬁlm. The noted director-producerfrom England
has had great success with the suspense ﬁlm as he demon-
strates in a simple and delightful style the manners of traps
into which human beings can fall. His latest production, “The

‘Running Man,” is a straightfor-°

award and breezy diver-tissement
that builds and builds,’ and
achieves a sense of‘ drama and
suspense that is highly "entertain-
ing. - I

Laurence Harvey, Lee Remick,
and Alan.Bates combine acting
forces ‘under the directors "skillful
hand and they are manipulated
against eachiother as the objects

of a chess game. This chess game

is very simple.‘ “The Running
Man” deals with Harvey’s suppos-
ed death, the insurance that his
widow collects, and their attempt
to spend the insurance
money, with Harvey
changing his identity
and Ire-V-marrying the
grieving widow. It is
all a plan to get back at the in-
surance Company becauselof the
‘30mpany’s refusal to pay off after

Chess
Game

,an accident since the premium

wasn’t paid in time. Miss Remick
gets the money and flies td Spain
to meet Mr.‘ Harvey. Alan Bates
portrays an insurance investigator

, at the beginning of the ﬁlm and

then turns up in Malaga appearing
to pursue the - couple and turn

them in to the police" for fraud.

What follows in the drama are
touches of irony and humor that

._ keep the action and -the characters

on the move so constantly that at
times I wasn’t sure as to who is

the Pursue: and who is the pur— '
' sued. The ending is an interesting

twist of fate, which folds up the‘
chess board and throws the objects
into total confusion.

Getting back to’ the directors
f0I‘Dflu1a, it is apparent that given
an lntrlgulng Script to work from
p_lus a handful of competent ac-
tors, andpadding‘ certain deﬁnitive
touches that have been gathered to-
gether from years of movie exper-
ience, the result will be interesting
and worthwhile. This gives the di-

W rector a chance toshow his hand

to the other card players and Mr,
Reedfs hand is a full house. The
panorama of the Spanish country-
side, the pictures of small town
Peasant life, and the sudden ‘cli-
maxes, one after another, definite-
ly make the ﬁlm a director’s pro-

—duct. Script performance, camera,
dialogue are all subordinates to

the work of the director.

, The performers are quite good.

In this

beautiful in color and her acting
is adequate. I think it will be a
long time coming before she gets
a role such as the one shehad in
“The Days of Wine and Roses.”
Alan Bates is new to the Amer-
ican public and a welcome addi-

tion to the screen. He registers’

solidly as an actor and‘ his looks
are that of an individual quite
apart from the Hollywood pretty-
boy image.

However, in the long ‘run,’ “The
Running Man” is a dir.ect0_r’s ﬁlm
and Carol Reed is at his best. An-

other part of his formula might ‘I

be to include the word “man” in
his titles. The man who gave’ us

.“The Third Man,” “The Man Be-

tween,” and “Our Man in Havana”
has followed suit with ‘.‘The Run-
ning Man” and produced an en-
joyable and suspenseful ﬁlm that
is also interesting and fun for the
average film-goer. I

Beano Stays Calm
In Face of Criticism

Beano Cook shrugs oﬁ criticism the way Jimmy
Brown. shakes off tacklers. Repeated blasts at Beano have
failed to get him down. Instead he comes bouncing back

- with as much zest as the Cleveland fullback. I

The latest barrage of abuse hurled at‘ Beano is as

result of the play-by-play description he did of the
- Panther-Navy game over closed

game

 

circuit television last Saturday.

Numerous
made about the manner in which
Beano announced. Some said he‘
leaned over backwards to favor
Navy and at the same time made
Pitt look bad.

“I don’t care what they said,”
Beano explained. “I called. the

complaints were

the way I saw it. And the

way I saw it, Navy outplayed Pitt.”
Wasn't a Cheerleader
Beano continued, “People are

. always complaining about announ-
cers that are cheerleaders. Well I didn’t lead cheers. I

was impartial.

“If they want someone that’s

going to spend the

whole game rapping the officials or rooting for the L
home team they better get someone else, because if.

they ever ask me to do it

same way.”

again I’ll announce the

Beano is only living up to his old motto,’ “I don’t
care what you say about me, I can take it.” He doesn’t
mind being criticized even if he feels it was unjust.

Before anyone gets the wrong idea about Cook it had

better be saidthat he is for’Pitt 100 per cent, the im-

pression he left over the air to the contrary. As he says,
“I root for Pitt with my heart‘, not with my mouth.”

Denies Statement

Beano denies that he said,

“It will be a miracle if *

Pitt wins,” at the start of the fourth quarter. “I know I
said that,” the publicity man commented, “but I’m pretty
sure I said it when the score was 17-0 and not 10-0.”
Since we were in Annapolis for the game we .
didn’t get a chance. to see the TV version. But from

what we’ve’ heard Beano

wasn’t’too far wrong on

what he said. Navy badly outplayed the Panthers

and Roger Staubach is a truly great -quarterback. ,

Boaters Try, for ifth Victory

gainst lVc'st Chc"stcrS‘a/teurday

By FRED MARCUS

When the ‘soccer team plays at West Chester Saturday
at 2 p.m. itlwill be. trying to gain its ﬁrst victory in its short
history against the Rams. West'Chester\leads the series with

_ one win and two ties.

The Panthers, at 4-3, show a three game winning streak

 while the Rams have already suffered two losses.

~ West Chester coach Mel Lor-¢
back admits that the team is hav-

ing troubles this year. “Last year’s
freshman team was the poorest
that I have had since coming to

West Chester” (ﬁve years ago), he.

said. Eight lettermeri graduated,

-eight returned. -

Beat Penn State

West Chester barely edged Penn
State, 1-0. The only goal was
scored when a Penn State fullback
accidentally kicked the ball into
his own goal. Last week they
squeaked by Seton Hall, 1-0, in
overtime. But they can deﬁnitely
be expected to be up for the Pan-

.ther game after their dissatisfac-

tion with -the tie last year.
Among the West Chester loss-
es through graduation were all-
American center forward Don

,'Williams, who scored all three
goals against the Panthers last
season, fullback Bill Killen, and
goalie Jack Strode. Lorback
feels his team is strong at half-
back, but the line play is a ques-
tion mark. »

The fact that the Panthers won
the district title“ last year will
probably give them added incen-
tive. .

Coach Leo Bemis received word
that they “have good speed and
pass the ball a lot, although they
do not have much scoring.”

As a prelude to the West Ches-
ter game the Panther varsity and
freshman teams play an exhibition
game with the Allegheny All-Stars
at Bridgeville Park in Bridgeville
tonight at 8:15 p.m.

‘ recent years.

By AL BLUMKIN

Despite the disappointing loss to Navy last‘
§.J€€k, there was one facet of play by the
Panther gridders that was outstanding. The de-
fensive ends played their ﬁnest game in
recent years. ~

“They were terriﬁc,” said end coach Ernie
Hefferle. “This was the best performance I’ve
seen since I’ve been here.” .

The ends, particularly A1 Grigaliunas,.Joe
Kuzneski, and Gene Sobolewski, kept tremend-
-' ‘   ous pressure on Roger
Staubach all game. The
Middle ‘quarterback,’ a‘
Time. Magazine 1 cover
boy, lost 93 yards at-
tempting" to pass and
was held to minus 33‘
yards rushing for the

game. I
Mindful of Panthers
There were times
when this pressure was

 

0'-reminiscent of certain ‘Panther quarterbacks who-

-spent the whole game looking at the sky in
“This was the best any team has
done against Staubach in a year and a half,”

’ said Hefferle-. - 1

Hefferle was high in his praise of Gene
Sobolewski. “He doesn’t play often,” said the
coach, “but he will be in there more after
that performance. There were moments when
I thought .-he was keeping company wit
Staubach permanently.” '

The coaches held a light workout Monday in
‘starting preparation for the game with the
powerful Syracuse Orangemen Saturday. The
players are still trying to‘ shake off the defeat
which stopped the four‘-game winning streak
and which dropped the Panthers to 12th in the
United Press International football rankings.

Can’t Look Back

. “We have no time to look back to last week,”
said head coach John Michelosen. “This Syra-
cuse ball club will be enough trouble.” The
Orange come here with a 5-1 record. They have
lost only to Kansas in an upset. The only com-
mon« opponent they and the Panthers have _

29-7, whilegthe Panthers humbled the Bruins,
20-0. The Ben Schwartzwalder-coached club
lists a 9-0 triumph over Penn State among its

SUCCGSSGS.

The Ora-nge’s most impressive performance
was this past week when they slaughtered a
good Oregon State club, 31-8. Walley Mahle,
their ﬁrst string quarterback, was hurt, but.
substitute Rich King passed for two touch-
downs and displayed a Syracuse passing at-
tack which was barely noticeable in their
previous games. _ _

Some players think the Panthers will come
back. “I think we got all the mistakes out ‘of
our system,” said safetyman Glenn Lehner.
“We’ll be ready for them.” .

Last year, also on Homecoming Day, the’
Panthers played their best game of the season

in humbling the Orange, 24-6. Syracuse was
held to minus 11 yards rushing as the Panther

line put on a savage display of tackling. _This_ s _

year may be _dii’r‘er‘ent. “Last year they were all

contest,” said Michelosen. '

The squad is. expected to be in good physi-
cal shape. Most of the players are{still shak-
ing off the bumps and bruises from the Navy
contest. Tackle Ernie Borghetti, nursing ,a
sore leg, was the only one" who did not par-
ticipate in the workout Monday. He is ex-
pected to be ready for the contest Saturday.

The gridders will spend the rest of the week
ironing out the ﬂaws whichlcropped up in the
Navy game. A top performance will be neces-
sary if the Panthers are to win their fourth
consecutive Homecoming game.

Unbeaten by Teamniates This Year

‘Bailey Best Runner

By WAYNE HANSON
Unbeaten by. any of his
teammates so far this season,
John Bailey has established

. himself asione of the best run-

r»"

...,-c
r.—s..- -

 

ners in cross-country and long
0 ' .
distance track 1I1 recent years.

Cross country and track coach

Carl Rees says, “John is the best
runner we’ve had in cross-country
since 1958. He is "very conscienti-
ous and a consistantlyhard work-
er. He gets along well with the
other members of the team and
becomes annoyed with himself-
when he performs poorly.

“However, he seldom. runs poor-
ly. He is probably the most con-
sistant and dependable runner
we’ve had in years—and hasone of
the best records for dual meet
competition.”

 

High School Star

Bailey makes his home in Ken-
nett Square, Pa., where in high
school he established himself as
one of the best distance runners
in the school’s history. While there
he earned ﬁve varsity letters,
three in track and two in cross-
country.

As a senior in high school
Bailey captained the cross-coun-
try team and was its leading
runner for the second consecu-
tive year. In track he ran a 4:29
mile to rank fourth in thestate.

A junior majoring in English
and writing, Bailey plans to go on
for his masters and then to teach
in high school. In addition he feels
that he might like to coach track‘.
He added “I enjoy traveling, in-
tramural athletics, singing an
listening to "folk music.” ‘

' Third Last Year

Last year as a sophomore Bailey.

S '  
was the third best runner on the
squad, but because of his deter-
mination and pre-season practice
he has moved into the number one
position ahead of the two men
that beat’ him last year.

Commenting on the team’s

3-3 record so far this season,

Bailey said, “The group in gen-

eral isn’t- running up to poten-

tial. We have a good team and
should be doing much better.”

The arduous task of running
cross-country for the last eight
years has not dampened Bailey’s
enthu":.sm for the sport. “I like
cross-country” he said. “It’s a
challenge to me more than any-
thing else. The challenge is to ‘try-
to get in front of -every one else
and stay there.”

As far as his teammates are con-
cerned he has fully beaten the

challenge.
