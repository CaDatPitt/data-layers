Student Government Board President Mike
Nites is no stranger to revisions.

The 20l13,Board modiﬁed documents at its
lastipublic meeting duringwhich then—Board
member Nites didn’t voice his ideas.

But over  break, Nites individually
compiled an Entirely new governing code into
a 30—page document. V

The Board adopted the SGB Governing
Code at Tuesday night’s public meeting in
Nordy’s Place in front of about 30 people.
The code includes the Board’s bylaws, which

 are dispersed throughout the document, as

well as modiﬁcations to the Board’s policies.

Nites, the self-proclaimed “proponent of
rules,” drafted the code before introducing it
at last week’s meeting. The Board amended

’ several sections at the meeting before ap-

 Board establishes new governing code

proving all nine bills that make up the code.

Board member Ellie Tsatsos said that even
though Nites was the composer, the Board
_members still expressed their opinions.

“It was his choice to write [the code], and
we were not forced in any position to accept
them. He can honestly propose whatever he
wants, but it’s up to the Board to decide if we

fered the creative writing minor last se-
mester, and it has since proposed addition-
al curriculum changes to its majors. The
department has proposed that students
in upper-level classes choose an elective
course instead of the advanced nonﬁction,
ﬁction or poetry course.

The current advanced—level English
writing course is the third course in the
sequence of four workshop requirements,
which involve an interactive revision pro-
cess between students and a professor on
pieces of writing throughout the semester.

Jeanne Marie Laskas, director of the .

writing program, said the English depart-
ment proposed the replacement of one of
four required workshop classes — speciﬁ-

cally the advanced level course -—— with a
“menu of courses’f that focus on craft.

If the Dietrich School of Arts and Sci-
ences approves the proposal, students can
instead opt for a course that aligns with
their particular interests. '

Laskas said the‘ change comes as a
result of discussions among the English
writing program’s curriculum commit-

'tee, which responds to comments from _

students and professors.

“Because we have so many students
who are interested in other genres, cross-
genrework, digital work and all types of
things, we didn’t want to lock them into
that one version of the course,” Laskas
said. A

Laskas said students’ and professors’

feedback fueled the change within the‘

English writing program. The program
issues an assessment every year, and many

students responded that their classes con- »

sisted of “too much workshopping.”

“There was a call for more craft-focused
courses,” Laskas said.

She added that workshopping could be
more appropriate during senior seminar,
in which English writing majors work on a
singleproject across a semester, but is not
as necessary during earlier stages.

Don Bialostosky, chair of the English
department, said that because the in-
troductory, intermediate and advanced

classes are all workshop classes, they can‘

start to feel very similar. \

In some cases, this course change will
alsofenable English majors to graduate
early, according to Mark Kemp, a lecturer
and academic adviser in the English de-
partment.

Because the major previously required
students to take four prerequisite courses

in a workshop sequence,~Kemp said the

elimination of one workshop course will i

make the major able to be complete in
three terms rather than four. A student
would be able to take one of the work-
shop courses at the same time as the newly
added elective course.

The English writing program, accord-
ing to Kemp, has also proposed to offer
more elective courses than in previous
years, including Performing Fiction, Sci-
ence Writing, Writing the Review and
Women in Journalism. —

Kemp said“ other ideas for the menu of '

courses include classes on topics such as
publishing, writing and politics, sentence
shop —— which will focus on style and edit-
ing — children_’s books, advanced screen-
writing and suspense and form.

want to disagree or agree with him,” Tsatsos
said.

The new SGB Government Code consists
of titles, or separate governing documents,
which are organized into chapters. At the
meeting, the adoption of the code created
Title I, which includes six chapters of policies
regarding the president, Board, committees,
Green Fund Advisory Board, legislation and

other governing documents.

The code also reorganizes the Allocations
Manual by removing sections —— including
ones containing information about the Stu-
dent Organization Resource Center and pro-

_ gramming resources — that the Board has

deemed irrelevant to the manual.

Nites said the changes will address issues
with accountability, transparency and clarity.
The comprehensive document will prevent
the Board from losing documents, Nites said,
and the deﬁned rules will minimize conflicts

on the Board. Nites said the Board already

practices the majority of the additional poli-

‘cies, but that these policies were previously

undocumented. _

Board member Graeme Meyer said he
thinks the code is a “very smart move” and
a “step in the right direction.” 

The ﬁrst bill created the structure for the
code while the following eight bills modiﬁed
and added to the code. The bills deﬁne the
president’s voting privileges, establish an of-
ﬁcial Board member attendance policy, create
a legislative process and recognize that the
code of ethics is a mandatory obligation. The

  A lesson for Teach For America

9

‘ Simon Brown
Columnist

On the first Monday after ﬁnals
week, the Pitt population ex-
perienced its first official day
of winter break, and the first
unofﬁcial day of “application
season,” when students fran-
tically prepare for internship,
fellowship and job hunting. No
doubt, a considerable number
joined the 50,000 students
nationwide" competing for the
coveted Teach for America po-
sitions, inspired by the group’s
message of educational equity.

On the same day, the mi-
crophones at the meeting of
the Pittsburgh Public Schools

‘yielded over and over to par-

ents and teachers demanding
the district rescind its recent .
contract with Teach for Amer-
ica, all in-the name _of educa-
tional equity.

The speakers had their way.
Two days later, the newly seat-
ed board revoked the contract,
which would have employed
thirty Teach For America corps
members ——- college graduates
with seven weeks of classroom
training — as teachers in the
district. ,

Why, then, does an orga-
nization so committed to an
equal education for under—re—
sourced schools face such strict
opposition from the parents
and teachers most concerned
for the future of their com-
munity schools? The answer
lies not in the organization’s
motives, butin its methods. If
Teach For America wants le-

" gitimacy in the communities

it takes such pride in serving,

it needs to work beside, not

against, other teachers.

The Teach for America pro-
gram began in 1990 as an av-
enue to fill under—staffed and
under-funded public schools
with accomplished college
graduates, regardless of their
teaching credentials. Unlike
the vast majority of certified
teachers, these corps mem-
bers do not progress through
the intensive student-teaching
requirements for a degree in
education.

Despite limited credentials,
corps members receive a salary
comparable to any incoming
teacher — but the cost of hir-
ing to the university is signiﬁ-
cantly reduced. Multi—million
dollar donors such as the‘Bill
8: Melinda Gates Foundation
and The Walton Family Foun-
dation foot much of the bill for
participating districts.

When the Pittsburgh Pub-
lic Schools Board of Directors
signed the initial contract in
November, it agreed to pay be-
tween $3,000 and $5,000 for
each fully compensated corps
member.

To the superintendent and '

supportive board members,
this presented a golden oppor-
tunity to hire much—needed sci-
ence teachers on a dwindling
budget. '

To the majority of the board,
however, this posed only an-
other cost-cutting excuse to
place unprepared 22-year-olds
at the head of classes that re-
quire more experience and
confidence than any other.

- Ultimately, the people of
Pittsburgh spoke in tune with

the board. Clearly, for all its
noble intentions, Teach For
America cannot rely on its
low-cost contracts to garner
approval from parents and
teachers. Rather, the program
and its supporters must seri-
ously consider the objections
of the community rather than
writing them off as the political
motives of the teachers’ union.
These objections are under-
standable, especially consider-
ing the demands of parents
sending students to low-in-
come neighborhood schools.
A study conducted last year
by Great Public Schools, a lo-
cal education advocacy group
avowedly opposed to Teach For
America,‘ found that nine out
of ten community members
polled responded that “experi-
enced teachers are very impor-
tant to the success of a school.”
Though Teach For America
corps members can certainly
be effective teachers, it’s not
clear that seven weeks of train-
ing is adequate experience.
The public’s emphasis on

experience corresponds to a

concern about stability. The

.Teach For America program

works largely on a two-year
contract after which a majority
of students leave the program,
though a significant number
remain in educational profes-
sions. Nevertheless, the corps
works exclusively in low-in-
come districts, which see the
highest turnover of teachers
from all backgrounds because
of the challenges that come
with teaching students who

have little access to state or federal aid.

Not only can a committed teacher
develop sustaining relationships with
students, which can beneﬁt them all
through high school or middle school,
but they can also improve overall educa-
tion, according to a Stanford University

report. 1

Why, critics ask, would a program
that is noncommittal by nature take
responsibility for schools that already
suffer from high teacher turnover?

To assuage both concerns, Teach For
America should follow the example of
other teaching programs for college
graduates such as Blue Engine in New
York City and City Year, which place

corps members alongside teachers rath- ,

er than in lieu" of them. Both programs
stress collaboration by employing corps

r members for one-on—one tutoring with-

students during and outside class time.

Moreover, a reorganized strategy
such as this would ease Teach For
America’s entrance to any community

A reluctant to put its 18-year-old children

solely in the care of a 22-year-old corps
member. It wouldn’t j eopardize the ba-

graduates will still have the opportunity
to teach in a classroom, receive feed-
back from a seasoned educator, combat
school overcrowding and, ultimately,
take responsibility for a class.
Perhaps then, parents, teachers and
corps members will all meanthe same

thing when they say educational equity. ,

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers overcome lackadaisical play, top Georgia Tech

Tyler Pecyna _
Asszstant Sports Editor

As the basketball slipped out of redshirt
senior forward Lamar Patterson’s ﬁn-
gertips with a little more than a minute
to play in the ﬁrst half of the Pitt men’s
basketball game, his body seemed to
freeze in bewilderment, and his arms
reached out before him.

Georgia Tech guard Corey Heyward

dashed the opposite direction with the

ball, eventually ﬁnishing the play with
a layup. The Yellow Jackets led, 35-30.

Patterson had four miscues, nearly
matching his season-high turnover total
within the game’s first 20 minutes, and
shot 0-5 in the first half, but he wasn’t

the only Panther who looked confused.

In the opening frame, Pitt showed an
uncharacteristic carelessness‘ with the
ball that was exempliﬁed by seven turn-
overs, but the 22nd-ranked Panthers
regrouped behind precise passes from
Patterson to hold off Georgia Tech, 81-
74, Tuesday night at Hank McCamish
Pavillion in Atlanta.

The Panthers added nine ﬁrst-half
fouls to their sloppy play, resulting in
a 35-32 deﬁcit at the break. But with
critical offensive contributions from
sophomore guardjames Robinson, who
poured in 11 points, and ﬁfth-year se-
nior Talib Zanna, who had 10, Pitt re-
mained close. ‘ .

Robinson finished with a career-high
16 points and added ﬁve assists and four
steals, while Zanna posted 22 points and
nine rebounds. Both were consistently
solid, but it took a bounce-back half
from Patterson for Pitt (16-1, 4-0 ACC)
to begin pulling away.

Patterson scored the Panthers’ ﬁrst ’

two points of the second half on a layup
assisted by freshman forward Michael
Young. Then it was the ﬁfth-year se-
nior forward’s turn to distribute the
ball, unleashing a deep 3-pointe-r with
17:01’ to play.

Patterson faked a jump shot, his
heels barely elevating off the ground as
he whipped the ball above his head, and

took advantage of the split-second when
Chris Bolden, his defender, bit the bait.
Bolden tried to stay with Patterson, but
Patterson dribbled behind his back,
took a few steps, leapt and wisely opted
to dish around Daniel Miller, the Yellow
Jackets’ 6-foot—11 airborne center.
Even Zanna seemed surprised when
Patterson’s arm twisted around Miller’s
back with the ball. He fumbled it at first,
but ﬁnished with a layup that sparked
Pitt’s ensuing run, a 20-10 advantage
over the course of about 10 minutes.
In that span, which resulted in a 59-
47 Pitt lead, Patterson combined alley-

So much for the Atlantic Coast Confer-

Excluding Pitt and Syracuse, ACC
teams have plummeted from high con-
ference standings into mediocrity.

In the past two weeks, several of
these teams have collected convincing
wins, building up short-lived teases for
their fans, only to be put back into place
by another bottom-of-the-barrel team.

Notre Dame, for example, took this
path.

After beating Duke in a flawless game
Jan. 4, the Irish looked to be top con-
tenders for the conference title. They
then turned around and lost by seven
at home to North Carolina State and
traveled to Atlanta, bowing to Georgia
Tech in a game where they did not lead
for the ﬁrst 36 minutes.

In this week’s edition of the ACC
Breakdown, not one team deserves third
place. Twelve teams are tied for (14th

place — not third -— while Boston Col-
lege stands alone in last place.

Syracuse (17-0, 4-0 ACC)

Another week, another couple of
wins for the Orange. They knocked off
North Carolina on Saturday and Boston
College on Monday. The trio of C.]. Fair,
Trevor Cooney and Tyler Ennis is shap-
ing up to become the country’s most
dangerous backcourt. The Orange have
collected four double—digit wins in their
last ﬁve games, an impressive feat con-
sidering starting center Dajuan Coleman
missed them all with a left leg contusion.
Coleman was the centerpiece of head
coachjim Boeheim’s 2-3 zone. Coleman
is overcoming “soreness” and has been
labeled “day-to-day” by Boeheim.

Pitt (15-1, 3-0 ACC)

. As the season has progressed, Lamar
Patterson has racked up better nightly
averages in scoring. Patterson isn’t just
ﬁring away every time the ball touches
his hands either. He currently owns the
highest raw offensive efﬁciency among
players who are used in at least 24 per-

Pom.com. Patterson holds a 127.6 rat-
ing on the scale, which measures points
scored per 100 offensive possessions.
The loss of teammate and guard Durand
Johnson to season-ending ACL and me-
niscus tears will hurt the Panthers, but
head coachjamie Dixon will continue a
rotation of nine capable players, includ-
ing centerjoseph Uchebo, who might see
increased minutes in the second half of
the season as he recovers from a linger-
ing knee injury.

Clemson (12-5, 3-1 ACC)

Clemson is the epitome of an ACC
tease. The Tigers lost by 15 to Florida
State at home Thursday, then turned
around and put together an unprece-
dented second-half performance to beat
Duke 72-59 on Saturday. In the game,
K.]. McDaniels scored 24 points with 10
rebounds and three blocked shots. The
6-foot-6, 200-pound player has evolved
into one of the ACC’s most durable for-

ACC

wards and is leading the conference in
blocks per game at 2.9.
Florida State (11—4, 2-1 ACC)
Florida State has exceeded expecta-
tions, but is far from the likes of Pitt

and Syracuse. The Seminoles play 10

consecutive 14th-place teams before
they face Pitt in late February, so the
defensive-minded squad will have to
hold strong until then.

Duke (13-4, 2-2 ACC)

The Blue Devils beat No. 25 UCLA in

December to grab their first notewor— _

thy win, but have lost to two bad teams
in as many weeks. Yet they sit just one
spot behind No. 22 Pitt in the Associated
Press Poll. One more loss to a 14th-place

. team in addition to a poor ACC Tourna-

ment run and the Devils’ hopes for their
17th consecutive NCAA Tournament bid
might be in severe jeopardy.

Virginia (12-5, 3-1 ACC)

The sophomore-filled Cavaliers do
not have a bad loss, but after dropping

 Pl

a game to Duke on Monday, they’ll have
to beat Pitt or Syracuse or have a strong
ACG Tournament to get a postseason bid.

Georgia Tech (10-6, 1-2 ACC)

Few teams have a bread-and-butter
bruiser like 6-foot-11, 275-pound Daniel
Miller, who leads the ACC in ﬁeld-goal
percentage at 60 percent. Miller plays
with his back to the basket and has a
drop step that can create two-handed
dunks. The Yellowjackets got blown out
by Duke and never led in their recent
loss to Maryland. -

North Carolina (1o-6, 0-3 ACC)

North Carolina hasn’t seen a worse
start to conference play since 1997. The
Tar Heels’ recent performance couldn’t
be more of a mystery, considering the
fact that they beat the No. 1, No. 2 and
No. 11 teams in the nation (Louisville,

‘Michigan State and Kentucky, respec-

tively) early on. After the Heels’ double-
digit loss at Syracuse on Saturday, North
Carolina head coach Roy Williams said
his team is in the midst of a conﬁdence
famine, and players are experiencing
many of the ill— effects that come with it.

“When things are going well, the ball

sfuosi ‘rs CLAIM -W|l3|(ETSﬁ.

[sou ATH LETJIJS L

is an energy pill,” Williams told report-
ers. “When things are going poorly, you
don’t have that energy pill out there.”

Maryland (10-7, 2-2 ACC)

It’s a wonder how the Terrapins
picked up a convincing win against Geor-
gia Tech, but lost their next two games
at Pitt and Florida State by a combined
total of 44 points.

NC State (11-5, 1-2 ACC)

The Wolfpack lost 45-76 at home to
Virginia on Saturday. Forward T.]. War-
ren was held to four points.

Wake Forest (11-5, 1-2 ACC)

Wake Forest will take on NC State on
Wednesday and Clemson on Saturday,
two even matchups. Sophomore forward

Devin Thomas, who attended Cenxtrali

Dauphin High School in Harrisburg, Pa.,
is second in the conference with 8.9
rebounds per game.

Notre Dame (10-6, 1-2 ACC)

The Irish could use suspended Jer-
ian Grant’s hands, speed and perimeter
defense to keep opponents from scoring
77.3 points per game over the past four
games, the most recent losses to 14th-
place teams NC State and Georgia Tech.

Freshman Demetrius Jackson has scored
6.8 points per-game’ in Grant’s place. -

Miami (9-6, 1-2 ACC)

The Hurricaneswill have to show the
resilience that nearly brought them to
victory at Syracuse last week more of-
ten to make a late push for conference
legitimacy. They play Florida State on
Wednesday. I

a Virginia Tech (8-7, 1-‘2 ACC)

This season, good teams can_’t lose to
Boston College, and that’s just what the
Hokies did last week. They do, however,

- have an excuse: They’ve had more play-

ersj miss games because of injury than
any other ACC team this season. Mon-
tour High School graduate and freshman
pointguard Devin Wilson is fourth in
the ACC in assists’ with 4.9 per game.
Boston College (5-12, 1-3 ACC)
The Eagles are hands—down the worst

‘ team in the ACC, allowing opponents to

score 75 points per game, but they do
have one of the nation’s most prolific
scorers in Olivier Hanlan. The Canadian
is averaging 19.5 ppg, a nice combina-

. tion with teammate Ryan Anderson’s

15.4. I

oop lobs, over—the—head bullets riﬂed
to post players and a swished 3-point
jumper. His resurgent second half led to
a ﬁnal line of 12 points, seven rebounds,
seven assists and seven turnovers.

But the Yellowjackets (10—.7, 1-3 ACC)
enjoyed their own late surge. Pitt’s turn-
over bugaboo continued -— it matched
the seven first-half turnovers in the

second — and most of the loose balls
were coughed up late. Combined with 12

-_points from senior guard Trae Golden

in the last 1:26, Georgia Tech creeped
as_close as four points from Pitt with
28 seconds to play.

The Panthers-sank their free throws
down the stretch — 9-of-11 in the ﬁnal
1:14 —— and thwarted the home crowd’s
comeback spirit.

Patterson, whose seven turnovers
prove he was never at his sharpest
against the Yellow Jackets, made 2-of-
4 in that timeframe. a

Golden, who ﬁnished with 22 points,
took the ﬁnal shot of the game, which
landed in Patterson’s arms. This time he

froze with a look of relief, and the ball
ﬁrmlysecured in his ﬁngertips.
