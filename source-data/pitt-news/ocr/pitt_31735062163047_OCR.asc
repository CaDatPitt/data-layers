SG’s New

Committee

Lists Plans

By NATHAN FIRESTONE

A new "committee of Stu-
dent -‘Government, the Inter-
nal Relations Committee, has

formulated a program for the
coming trimester.

The committee, provided
for by the new Constitution, has
the purpose of improving student-
faculty relations. . '

Carl Pepine, director of the
committee, outlined the general
program. He said that question-
naires ‘will be given to teachers
asking them_ if they are in favor

of increased student—faculty rela-

tions and if they would be will-
ing to support them.

From these questionnaires, the
committee will compile a list
of teachers in various ﬁelds that
would be willing to serve as
chaperones, advisers and per-
form other duties. *
‘ They would then send out this

list to various student organiza-
tions and encourage them to in-
.vite interested faculty. _
Pepine discussed the advantages
of this new committee. “There is
a "deﬁnite advantage to a commit-
tee of this sort, since there is no
real line drawn between our work
and the work done by the public

relations committee (this commit-.

tee handles external aifairs).".

Pepine addedthat the commit-.

tee would try to institute a series
of round tablediscussions with a
“small, select, group of students
and willing faculty members,
especially ‘those who have been
on - faculties . of other institutions
where they have had an effective
student-faculty relationship.” ~
The discussions would cover is-
sues confronting Student. Govern-
ment and other student organiza-
tions which might tend to cause

animosity with the faculty mem- '

bers.

In Workshop

For Hostesses
History, Philosophy
Of Nationality Rooms
Taught in Program,

‘ By EMILY KAISERMAN
About 25 undergraduate

women participated in a

workshop for the training of

Nationality Room hostesses,

April 20-22. The women at-

tended classes which were

taught by present hostesses who
discussed the history and educa-
tional _hilosophy behind each of

4 the 18 rooms.

Miss Helen Rush, dean of

women, spoke to the group on the

background of the Nationality
Rooms. Miss Wynfred Joshua dis-
cussed the current programs of the
rooms.

In order to become a qualiﬁed
guide, the women who have com-

pleted the workshop training must.

take a written examination on the
importance and meaning of the
rooms. Then they must escort a
faculty member through a few of

--of the rooms.

Volunteer Guides

The guides are undergraduate
women who volunteer to hostess
at least two hours per week. They
give visitors a background of the
international rooms and how they
came into being, in addition to

explaining the furnishings of each.

Alice Ann Demetrius heads
the hostesses for thespring tri-
mester. Mrs. Vira Doughton, as-
sistant dean of women, is ad-
viser for the group.

“The reputation of our‘Interna-
tional Rooms is wide-spread,” said
Mrs. Doughton. “Over 3200 vis-
itors toured them last‘ summer

from many parts of the country, 1

as well as from foreign countries.
Hostesses are eligible to join the

, organization, Quo Vadis, which co-

ordinates with the Oﬁice of Cul-

‘tural rrid Educational Exchange.
Quo Vadis has established a

fund to provide a scholarship for

*1'oreign' study to a girl, each year.

This is part of a plan to further
the exchange of ideas between the
University and Europe.

Baseball Team
Ready to Make
 Move for 1960

By TED COLTON

  

Bobby Lewis’ baseball nine have ‘started off miserably.

_this year. Unlike our neighboring professionals the Pitts-
burgh Pirates, who took an early league lead, the Panthers
dropped their ﬁrst ﬁve games which surpasses last‘year’s lost
mark. (Editors Note: The Panthers played Navy yesterday at
Annapolis). ' _
, There areseveral reasons for this bad showing. For one
thing, Ohio State and Kent State, the two teams that beat
the Cats, are the strongest teams on the schedule. Meeting
them too early in the season resulted in these losses. .
Both teams went south for spring training ‘and played
more games than the Panthers this spring. Opening the sea-
son with Ohio State was "a mistake. The Panthers were not
ready. Neither were they ready for Kent. ‘ _

If these games had been scheduled for later in the

season, Lewis’ nine would have surely won‘ a couple of
,. them if not completely reversing the results. The .5-0
imark is not truly-representative of the Cats’ ability.
The second reason for the bad showing is weak hitting.
This does not mean the Panthers have weak hitters, it simply
means that the Cat’s hitters are not hitting. The que-stion_is,
when are they going to start?‘ Last year, players like Nick
Kartsonas, Jerry Matulevic and Ron Maser proved they were
good hitters, but these three boys have not been. hitting in
the early games and as a result the Cats aren’t winning.
The solution to this problem is simple. Each Panther
regular needs more batting practice. This would enable him
his “eye” and the team would score more runs. .
Besides the bad scheduling and weak spring ,hlttlng
there is one more problem which may hurt the Panthers.
This is pitching. What seemed to be a strong point early
in the season may develop into quite .a problem. With
two top-notch starters returning, the Cats should have
been'set in the pitching department. . .
‘However, Bob Conti has come down W1lJh.a bad arm .an_d
Dick Wirth has been both hot and cold. This leaves Lewis
without a -dependable starter. He has Ralph Shutterley,
Lauren Guthriez and Dick Wisniewski but they have not
proved themselves. Wisniewski has looked the best of the
. three. _ V - . . A
Lewis may have-to make a- move ,for another pitcher.
' If he does the most probable place-he 11 100k 1S'ﬁ1‘St base-
Maser,’ wholhurled for McKeesport High ‘SC_h_091; holds the
record for shutouts in WPIAL playoff competition. The big
lefthander was one of the most sought after .p1’£Ch€1‘_Si by the
big leagues after his junior year but hurt his arm his Sen10I‘
season: and has not been able to pitch regular since.

If Lewis decides to use IvIaser.he will get 9116 good
game from him, but the questions _is, will Maser be ablc
‘to pitch afterwards. If he is,—it will solve the Panther s
pitching problems. _ v _ ‘ ' _ '

The Panthers play four’ games in the next four days and

‘'‘-’’"”should ﬁnd themselves. Don’t be surprised ‘if they turn.that



 

losing streak intoa winning one and get right up there With

COLLEGE: THE FOE OF EDUCATION

In your quest for a college degree, are you becoming a narrow ~

specialist, or are you being educated in the broad, classical

sense of the word? This question is being asked today by many _ 
serious people—1nc1uding my barber, my podiatrist, and my

little dog Spot——and it would be well to seek an answer.

Let us examine our souls. Are we becoming experts only in.

the conﬁned area of our majors, or does our knowledge range
far. and wide‘? Do we, for example, know who fought in the
battle of Salamis, or Kant’ s epistemology, or Planck’s constant,
or the voyage of the Beagle, or Pa1estrina’s cantatas, or what
Wordsworth was doing ten miles above Tintern Abbey?

If we do not, we are turning, alas, into specialists. What,
then, can we do to escape this strait jacket, to broaden our
vistas, lengthen our horizons, to become,‘ in short, educated?

' Well sir, the ﬁrst thing we must do is throw away our curricula. ’

Tomorrow, instead of going to the same old classes, let us try
something _new. Let us think of college, not as a rigid discipline,
but as a kind of vast smorgasbord, with all kinds of tempting

intellectual tidbits to sample and savor. Let us dive in. Let ,_

our pent-up appetites roam and snatch where they will.

  

  la z/5 }r//// if 5/zz/5.

We will start the day with a stimulating seminar in Hittite
artifacts. Then we will go over to marine biology and spend a
happy hour with the mollusks. Then we will open our pores by
drilling with the ROTC for a spell. Then we’ll go over to journal-
ism and scramble a font of Bodoni. Then we’ll go to the medical
school and palpate a few spleens. Then we’ll .go to home
economics and have lunch.

And between classes we’Il smoke 'Marlboro Cigarettes. This‘.

let me emphasize, is not an added ﬁllip to the broadening of our '

education; it is an essential. To- learn to live richly and well is

an important part of education, and Marlboros are an important ' '

part of living richly and well. Do you think ﬂavor went out
when ﬁlters came in? Well, ha-ha, the joke is on you. Marlboro,
with its Selectrate ﬁlter, delivers ﬂavor in full measure, ﬂavor
without stint or compromise, ﬂavor that wrinkled care derides,

ﬂavor holding both its sides. This triumph of the tobacconist’s'

art comes to you in soft pack or ﬂip-top box and can be lighted
with » match, lighter, candle, Welsbach mantle, or by rubbing
two small Indians together. ' . ~ .

When we have embarked on this new regimen—-or, more ao-

curately, lack of regimen—we will soon be studded with culture"

like a ham with cloves. When strangers accost us on the street,

-and say, “What was Wordsworth doing ten miles above Tintern

Abbey?” we will no longer slink away in silent abashment. We
will reply loud and clear: '

“As any truly educated person knows, Wordsworth, Shelley,

and Keats used to go the Widdicombe Fair every year for the ‘
poetry-writing contests and three—legged races, both of which .-
‘they enjoyed wildly. Well sir, imagine their chagrin when they

arrived at the Fair in 1776 and learned that Oliver Cromwell,
jittery because Guy Fawkes had just invented the spinning
jenny, had canceled all public gatherings, including the Widdi-

combe Fair and Liverpool. Shelley was so upset that he _

drowned himself in the Bay of Naples, Keats went to London
and became Samuel Johnson, and Wordsworth ran blindly into
the forest until he collapsed in a heap ten miles above Tintern
Abbey. There he lay for several years, sobbing and kicking his
little fat legs. At length, peace returned to him. He composed
himself and, noticing for the ﬁrst time the beauty of the forest
around him, he wrote Joyce Kilmer’s immortal Trees . . . And
that, smartypants, is what Wordsworth was doing ten miles

Puets and peasants alike know that if you like mildness but
you don’t like ﬁlters, you can’t do better than Marlboro’:
companion cigarette—Philip Morris. '
