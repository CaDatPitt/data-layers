- Plenty of   Ticketsleft For W.-.l.. Game   "

On -account of the great demand for tickets for the W. & J.-PITT GAME
in the past, it has beenground into the public that it is impossible to get
;tickets for.this'game, even with the enormous capacity provided by the Putt
Stadium.‘ All alumni are ‘urgedaxto counteract this by spreading the news to
everyone interested in football that ti,cket§:_can ‘be’ gotten up to game time;
and that everyone who wants to go can be accommodated. The Stadium pro-
vides a seating capacity of over 65,000 with possibilities of taking care of an
overflow, if necessary. There is no limit on the =num,b_er of tickets _,that any-
one can purchase, and the management wants to pack the bowI,_if’ possibl_e.

Mail orders will be received up. to Friday for the game, if accompanied
by -certiﬁed check, cash or money order. in case of orders coming in too
late for. mail delivery, the tickets can be left at Spalding’s, 608 Wood st’reeet,!
and the buyer notified‘ bywire or telephone if located a distance from Pitts.-‘
-bur h.“ A K  , ‘ ' . ' A _
'gThé price" of all. reserved seats for the W. & J. game is $2.50 each.
Alumni ‘who have ordered and who desire, additional tickets can getthem’,
although they would not be located adjacent. to the ones originally furnished.-

Although the Penn Stategame will notbe played ‘until Thanksgiving
Day, Thursday, November'26, alumni are urged to rush in their reservations;
for this game. There is‘ no limit on the number of tickets one Valumnuscan‘
get, although four will be in the preferred locationx and the others'wi|l be
ﬁlled afterall the orders withit,h'e. four-ticket limit have been taken care of.
~ This will be the final game of the year in- the Pitt Stadium and the
management is‘ anxious to pack-‘it.'_Th‘e_re are very few counter attractions
Ion that7day, as it is? a -holiday_'a“nd the game should prove a fitting finale for
'an' unusual ‘season. Out ‘of town alumni who run across football fans who
are anxious to gel: tickets should assurethcm thatthey’ will have no trouble
about this. . ln.fact, these alumni should -accept the orders‘ and sendthem
in_ ‘with the, certified check,,cash or-fmoney order.“ T-HE THROTTLE IS-
WIDE OPEN so far as football -tickets for the State game —‘is'concerried, and
we‘ want every alumnus to fdelegate himself or herself as a salesman to dis-
pose of tickets. ’:The price of these seats. is $2.50 each. The kickoff‘ will be
at two" o’clock,‘ and there will be no {preliminary game on that day, the

can be taken with a loss of only one day from business, it is ,very..attr_a_,c-

plans forstudy ofnatural history at
‘various locations in V-andvabout South
America, were among the many ‘ex-
periencesw of Prof. Harold D, Fish,
head of the Zoology Department, this
summer. Pr_ofe«ssor Fish returned a
week ago from. the University jungle
laboratory at tropical biology at Kar-
ta-bo, British Guiana, and has since
narrated ‘the outstanding
events of his scientiﬁc wcrk-

"The purpose of the work at our
jungle la.bora._tory is to. discover life
processes, and to extend knowleclge.
of the jungle,” says Professor Fish.
“The interior of the British Guiana
contains perhaps the most unusual and
numerous specimens of animal life in
theworld. Our 1aboratory,’which has
in the past given so many new and
interesting specimens to the museums
of the world, this year added to
list of contributions more extens
and betterthan ever.” _

Students from colleges all overlthe
United States were se-lectedlto make
the trip, and returned‘ with the bene-
ﬁts what they consider an: unusually.
1'n__teres~ting ‘and proﬁtable‘ summer.
‘Registration in the class involvedthe

’ F_rom thestarting whistle, it was evi-
,'dent that Pitt was a diiferent team
from the one that played against

Kiski and Carnegie, The listless air
‘that had characterized its playing in
those contests was missing. A slight-
..l.y.altered backﬁeld started. Johnson
,was missing. Rooney, Crabb, Berk
man and Steinhouser played.
-SCORE IN EACH PERl0D'

Pitt scored in every period, but the

‘finale. which was shortened to permit

  I - “the varsity to take the ﬁeld on sched-
-uled time. Pittdrew ﬁrst blood on. the

inevitable blocked kick; Gette stop-

Five touchdowns were chalked up.
against the Marylanders, all coming
on little other than (‘straight football
and ability to take. advantage of the
breaks. No strategy was revealed to
.W.- & Jqscouts, except perhaps to
strengthen the conclusion “that the
Presidents will have to be at their
best to overcome the Panther Satur-
day.  - ‘ i ' N » .
Hardly three minutes ofthe open-
ing" period had passed before Pitt
breezed across for its ﬁrst tally. .The.
Panthers had kicked off and Hopkins,
held forydowns, called Berhdt back to
punt. The boot was partially" blocked
and Red M'cCutcheon recovered on the

Panther 44. Alan Booth, hard-hitting:

fullback, thrice walloped _the enemy
line, netting 15 yards and_ a first down
on the Baltimore"-11. .McCutcheon-
skirted right end for ﬁve. Booth came
right back on a trick play to dash’ to
Hopkins’ sevén—yard’line. -Booth was
stopped at _center,. but the -visitors
were offside,'le_a_ving Pitt with ‘a yard

to go. Alan made it ﬁrst crack, and

the ball game, fo_r practical purposes.
was over, thoifgh Booth missed the
try for placement and left ..the visitors‘
with a chance ‘to. nab the lead had
theybeen able to cop a touchdow
and add the extra point.‘ . t
A few minutes later and the»Pan-
ther left no doubt as to the ﬁnal out-
come. The-, tawney beast, in the per-

son of Demoise, right end, scooped up -,

a fumble by,Taylor,and was off in a
ﬂash, culminating a 28-yard race for

a touchdown and boosting :the. total _

to an even dozen. .
Two additional scores: quickly fol-
lowed in ‘the second" period. It was
scarcely under way when the third
counter, slashed over. As immediate-,

ly "before, a‘ -Taylor,‘ bobble. paved the" "
path to the uprights. ~ The Maryland ‘

leader dropped .a. wide. toss from cen-
ter and Roberts recovered on Hop-
kins’ .44. From there, it was ',just
smash, smash, smash until McC1.it-
cheon streaked around right end and
paced oh the ﬁnal ‘parallel unmol-‘
ested. . - S “ - . _

At this point Griddle replaced -Mc-

Cutcheon and almost immediately had?
the crowd roaring plaudits in his ears ‘
for a scintillating, brilliant end run

for 40 yards for the fourth Pitt score.
Several times Griddle seemed caught’,
but he eluded" his would-be tacklers
and continued on to the goal. , l ‘

Thejisoutherners fought hard in the
third period and kept the cougar from
grabbing. off another touchdown, but

on, the first play‘ of the ﬁnal ‘.quart_er,. .

Hoban broke _’loose on an oﬁ-tackle
play and sprinted 30 yards for what
proved the ~last ‘score of the day".
Hoban then” proceeded to make "the
only Pitt point _after touchdown by
making a perfect—place_ment _bo,ot.‘“~_-_
