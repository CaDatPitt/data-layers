Litchfield Towers desk attend-
ant Anthony Still thought he was
helping a friend in need. The
University of Pittsburgh reward-
ed him with a suspension from
his job.

Still was working on the night
of Friday, Jan. 20, when a female
Pitt student informed him that she
had been sexually assaulted by
another student. .

The woman confided to Still
what had happened; however,

Senior Staff Writer -

After‘ finals are over, students 

can join the Pitt Informal Program

on a trip. Price: about 4,480 '

rubles." _ .
That equals about $3,200 for

16 days of traveling to nearly ev- -
ery corner of the Soviet Union.‘

Q‘ Dr. William Chase, who will

  

lead the trip, feels that this is a lot

- of money until one thinks about

what he will get for that amount.
The group will leave Pittsburgh
on April ‘27 and fly to New York's
Kennedy airport to board a flight
to Copenhagen, Denmark.
From Copenhagen, the trip,will

continue on to Moscow that

‘same day. Plan to be in the airfor

. about 12 hours.

to press charges and wanted the
matter dropped.

According to Still, a person
who knew both the supposed vic-
tim and attacker confronted the
attacker and informed him to
”stay away from her," and
”Don’t go around her.”

On Sunday, Jan.- 22, Still said,
the alleged attacker and a friend
of his entered Still’s attendant’s
cubical and made threats to him.
Still informed Campus Police that
the two had made terroristic
threats to him; however, he
decided against pressing charges,

The big attraction for the group a

in Moscow, said Chase, will be
the May Day parade on May 1.
Chase described the celebration
as a sort of Russian Mardi Gras.

Chase said -that on May 2,
”when the locals are sobering
up-,” they will continue on to cen-
tral Asia, near the Chinese
border. .

According to Chase, the advan-
tage this trip has over past trips to
the U.S.S.R., which included
museum tours in Moscow and
Leningrad, is that it will be more
diverse than other Soviet muse-
um excursions.

From central Asia, the next stop
will be Georgia in the southeast
corner of the _Soviet Union.

Georgia is tropical. and moun-

tainous, Chase said. It also offers
some of the best fruit and wine,

A report of the incidents was
sent to the Office of Residence
Life, where Still said he was then
questioned by director Jo Ann
Woodson, assistant director Ger-
ry Kowalski and an unnamed»de-
tective. _ .

”[Gerry Kowalski] wanted me
to write down everything that had
occurred, and I told him [state-
ments by the victim] were a pri-

Union, they have -been a little_

anxious about traveling in the
”evil empire.” He said that
younger people tend not to have
as negative an impression of that
country. And it is well that they
dont. .

Pitt student charges.s?5FBl
in ACLU-sponsored suit

By William Young

.Managing Editor

Eric Davin, a graduate student
in Pitt's department of history,

I filed suit yesterday with the .

American Civil Libe,rti_es Union
against the Federal Bureau of In-

‘ vestigation. .
Davin filed suit after informa-

tion he requested from the FBI on
Genevieve Taggard, an early 20th
century American poet, was
either denied or censored.
”The reason [the FBI] can't dis-

close all of it, they say, is because ~

it would endanger the national
security of the United States,”
Davin said. ”Genevieve Taggard
died in 1948, 41 years ago. It is
difficult [to see]  how a long-
dead poet could endanger the na-

tional security of- the United

States.”
Prior to the Reagan administra-

_ tion, historians were entitled ac-

cess to documents on people
who had been deceased for 40 or
more years. The Reagan adminis-
tration set an indefinite time limit.
Davin requested approximate-
ly 150 pages of material from the
FBI for a biography he is writing
on Taggard, and received’ less
than .75 pages, most of which
were heavily edited with a black
magic marker, often deleting 80
to 90 percent of at page
”There is not much here,”

Davin said, holding up a black-
ened page. ”It’s not possible to .

find out too much about
Genevieve Taggard from this par-
ticular release.”

Davin originally applied for the I

information in April of 1986, and

V it took the FBI a year-and-a-half’
‘to send him any records about

Taggard. Davin said that it took
so long because the documents
had to first be identified and then
sent to another FBI agent-, who“

Harvey Adams, president 
A&S Security, which employs j;

time, Still is on medical leave_,:ﬂ_
and his company will review the}; . 1
situation to evaluate when Stilll
will be able to return to work. 3 ‘

North's lawyers argue controlof classified material

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ Law-
yers for Oliver North said in a

. court filing released Monday that

they would be unable to defend
him adequately under a proposed
agreement to control the use of
classified material North wants to
use in his defense.

The proposed agreement
”would guarantee a ‘cuckoo-
clock’ trial that would make a
mockery of the adversarial
process,” said North's lawyer,
Brendan Sullivan. He said that
without the information he wants
to present, ”we cannot adequate-
ly defend this case.”

The agreement was worked out
between the office of indepen-
dent counsel Lawrence Walsh,
who is prosecuting North, and
the Justice Department, which
fears that North will spill classi-
fied material at his trial damaging
to national security.

The proposed order would
”gut the defense” by barring
North from using ”critical infor-
mation about the Reagan ad-
ministration’s third-country
arrangements for military support

and the official non—disclosure of
those arrangements,” said the fil-
ing by Sullivan.

In referring to a ”cuckoo-
c|ock” trial, Sullivan was quoting
the judge in the Iran-Contra case,
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell. Gesell has made it clear
that the government's proposed
order would have nine categories
of classified information that
should not be revealed at trial be-
fore prosecutors have had an'op-
portunity to contest its relevance.

Moslems attempt to
ban ’satanic’ novel

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -
Moslem fundamentalists around
the world demand that Salman
Rushdie’s novel
Verses be banned as blasphemy
against Islam, and this weekend
the campaign turned violent.

At least five people were killed
and more than 80 injured Sunday
when police fired on a mob try-
ing to storm the U.S. Information
Center in Islamabad. The pro-

The Satanic _

 

NEWS BRIEFS

testers demanded the book be‘

banned in the United States.

Fundamentalists say the book
does not recognize Islam as the
one true religion and ridicules the
most precious Moslem beliefs.
Pakistan and other Moslem na-
tions banned the book after its
publication last year.

Rushdie, 41, was born in India
to Moslem parents and educated
in Britain, where he lives. His
other books include Midnight's
Children, which won Britain's
prestigious Booker prize, Shame
and The Jaguar Smile.

Orchestra considers
summer relocation

(AP) — Representatives of the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
are considering establishing a
permanent summer home and
are searching throughout Penn-
sylvania for possible sites.

”It’s at the preliminary stage,”
Stephen Berwind, symphony
spokesman, said Monday. ”There
are no official anythings.”

Mark Troen, vice president of
Security Pacific Realty Advisory
Services of New York, said his
firm has been hired by the or-
chestra to evaluate sites for land
costs, access by highway and
community support.

' Bedford and State College are
two sites being considered, Troen
said.

Berwind declined to reveal
other potential spots.

”We’ve been extremely careful
in completing our assessment to
make sure nobody gets an unfair
advantage,” Troen said.

CHICAGO (AP) — Sixty years
ago Tuesday, machine-gun fire
echoed from a garage in a Near
North Side neighborhood, and
seven members of George
”Bugs” Moran's gang fell dead in
the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.

It was the Prohibition era's gori-
est crime and the beginning of
the end of gangster rule.

Now Prohibition is dead and
the garage is gone, but the
memories live on for some Chica-
go residents, who vividly recall
when ”gangland graduated from
murder to massacre,” as news ac-

 

counts of the day put it.

A senior citizen's home bor-
ders the site, and residents of the
Lincoln Park Senior Center say
their parking lot is on the very
spot where the seven fell. Some
residents believe their ghosts still
walk.

’’I’d be sitting on my reclining
chair and hear things moving
around  knives and forks clang-
ing together.  I'd hear someone
go out the door,” said Madeline
Bushbaum, 84, who lived in the
neighborhood at the time.

”We always figured it was the
dead ones looking for the ones
that killed ’em,” said Bushbaum,
who has moved out of the room

closest to the murder site. ’’I don't
hear ’em anymore, but several
people moved out of the build-
ing because they said they were
disturbed.”

At the time of the massacre,
”Scarface” Al Capone, leader of
Near South Side bootlegging
operations, wanted Moran's ter-
ritory up north.

On the morning of Feb. 14,
1929, a day when the tempera-
ture was 10 below zero, four men
— two wearing police uniforms
— raided Moran's garage head-
quarters.

They lined the men up against
the wall as if for a routine frisk for
weapons, and instead delivered

THE PITT NEWS,‘ Tuesday, February 14, 1989

  Anniversary of 1929 Chicago massacre observed

a Valentine's Day hail of gunfire
that riddled the victims, almost
severing limbs.

Bushbaum, then a 24-year-old
evening telephone operator, was
playing pool with the guys in the
back room of Drake Braithwaite
undertakers, about three blocks
from the scene. She said she often
helped out, answering the tele-
phone when the employees went
out ”to pick up a stiff.”

”While we were playing, the
garage door flew open and there
were the coppers and the paddy
wagon,” she recalled.

”They brought in two bodies
on two slabs and just slid ’em off
on -the floor and said, ’\Ne gotta

go back, we got five more dead
out there.’

’’I saw the guy with half his
brains shot out, and I tell you, I
didn't feel so good,” Bushbaum
said.

Six of the victims died instantly.

Frank Gusenberg, fading fast in
his hospital bed, upheld the gang-
land code when police asked
who was responsible for the
shooﬁng.

”Nobody,” Gusenberg said.
’’It’s getting dark, sarge. So long.’’

Moran, who was not at his
headquarters that day, later told
police: ’’Only the Capone gang
kills like that.” '

Authorities never proved a Ca-
pone connection, and the mas-
sacre is still listed in police files
as ”murder by persons
unknown.”

But the violence hastened a

A resurgence of law and order that

crushed gangster rule and even-
tually brought the arrest and
downfall of Capone.

sparkles
without
scoring

Sean Miller stood in the in-
ner hallway of the Civic Are-
na enduring another
post—game interview, this one
on the heels of Pitt's 79-74 up-
set of No. 2 Georgetown on
Saturday.

But reporters didn't crowd
around the sophomore point
guard. Most of the attention
was received by Jason Mat-
thews, who scored 24 points,
and Bobby Martin, who
grabbed 11 rebounds and
overshadowed Georgetown’s
hulking first-year centers,
Alonzo Mourning and
Dikembe Mutumbo.

After all, Miller had scored
a mere two points and didn't
score at all until he converted

MATT  
MARTIN

two free throws with :51 se-
conds remaining in the game.
And Miller had been getting
pre-, post- and in—game jitters
-—-_’’It seems like all I've been
doing is throwing up,” — over
the past few games. How
could he have been a factor?
A simple 11 assists, no turn-
overs, one steal and three re-
bounds in 38 iminutes
answered that question. ,
Miller played a nearly flaw-
less floor game, physically and
mentally, down to the last
minute, when he directed
. swingman Darelle Porter to in-
bound the basketball off a Ge-
orgetown player’s derriere to
break a full-court press and al-
low the Panthers to maintain
a 74-71 lead with only :35 se-
conds remaining. --

D _’ ‘Give me the creditgfor that
one,” Miller said. ”lwent up
to [Porter] and told ‘him to
throw that up.’,’

And give him credit for the I

win-. He held Hoya point
guard and leading scorer
Charles Smith to two‘ of seven
‘shooting in the second half af-
ter a four-for-four first period.

Miller's 11 assists tied his

personal record and was one '
short of Pitt's seasonhigh, set '

by Porter in a 90-76 victory
over Northwestern; v

”He played really well,”
Georgetown Coach John
Thompson said. ”He accom-
plished a lot out front.”

Although Miller overcame
his lack ofpoints with his all-
around play, the Panthers,
more importantly, may have
realized that they don't need
Miller's scoring in order to win
a game, something Pitt Coach
Paul Evans has said since the
beginning of the season, when
his guard was verbally at-
tacked by fans for not shooting
enough.» 1

Pitt spread the scoring be-
tween six players — Brian
Shorter (15), Porter (11), Mar-
tin (16), Matthews (24), Rod

-Brookin (11) and Miller.

against a normally vicious Ge-
orgetown defense, had 17 as-
sists to the Hoya’s 14,

outrebounded GT 38-29 and .

went to the foul line twice as
many times as the Hoyas
(30-42, 15-20). 5

And Pitt played defense,
something that has not been a
staple of the Panther game so
far this year.

”They played good overall
defense,”' Thompson said.
”They got loose balls and out-
hustled [us].” '

“Games like this are won

.through tremendous efforts,”

Miller said.

This was the ‘fourth tremen-
dous effort by this Pi_tt ‘team
against a Top 10 P|'08T3m
since Jan. 4, when it knocked
off then-second ranked and
undefeated Syracuse 81-76 at
the Carrier Dome.

The Panthers also defeated
No. 3 Oklahoma 99-91 at the
Fitzgerald Field House on Jan.
15 and No.9 Seton Hall 82-79
at Brendan fByrne Arena on
Jan. 25.

But Pitt's record stands at
12-10, 5-6 in the Big East after
beating Georgetown. The
team that has proven i_t can
play with nearly anyone has
watched Siena, Duqu'esne and
West Virginia waltz away with
close victories, and watched
their NCAA Tournament
-hopes dwindle with those
losses.

Sean Miller had 11 assists against the Georgetown Hoyas.

’’I don't think there's any an-
swer,” Miller said. ’.’We’ve
beaten some lesser teams,
too.” 1

Jerome Lane syndrome,
perhaps? Playing to the talent
level of the opposition?

Miller said Tuesday even-
ing’s game with St. John's —
whom Pitt defeated 85-81 in
overtime at Alumni Hall on
Jan. 30 — might be a telltale
sign. ' l «

Gymnasts falter at
Temple due to late
problems on beams

By Jenna Hunter
Staff Writer

The women's gymnastics team
trailed Temple University by only
one—tenth of a point throughout
a dual meet last weekend, but
had some problems on beam and
couldn't surpass the Owls, losing
180.45 to 178.1.

”We had a really good chance
of winning up until the last
event,” said junior team captain
Shelly Sleith. ’’I thought we could
pull it off”,

The _Lady Panthers kept the
meet close despite falls on bars
and beam. Going intojthe last
event, beam, the score was
134.55 for Pitt, 134.65 for
Temple. .

’’It was a good meet up until
beam," said head coach Debbie
Yohman.

On their first event, vaulting, '

sophomore Kathy Wallish led off
with an 8.85, a score she usually
receives for. a consistent full twist
on, handspring off.

Freshman Jen Butkovich also
scored 8.85 for a handspring with

- a full twist. Sophomore Tina Tay-

lor received a 9.05 for a nice
tucked tsukahara, and senior
Trish Aser scored a 9.0 for a
handspring full.

Sophomore Carrie Carnesale
performed a good full twist on,
full twist off for a 9.15 and a tie
for first place on vault.

Bars, the team's second event,’
was where the Lady Panthers ran
into some problems. Freshman
Gina Venezia hit a good set for
an 8.8, as did.Wallish for an 8.55.
Carnesale failed to catch a release
move in her routine, scoring low-
er than usual with an 8.25. ‘

Sleith, who is just comingoffa

her bar routine, but managed to
score well with an 8.8.
Butkovich had a good setfor a
9.0 and tied for third place, while
sophomore Jeannie Vecchio con-

 tinued to show why she's the

These meets were the last in a

long string of invitational meets —

for the Panthers. ln_these invita-
tionals, individual performances
are usually_stressed rather than

the performance of the team as a ,

whole. Individual athletes as well
as relay teams aim for scores that
will enable them to compete in
end-of-the-season tournaments.

distance medley relay team was
able to qualify-for the lC4As; a
meet which gathers the top track

The Panthers’ 4x800-meter re-
lay team of Tom Brookover, Dom
Duelli, Chris Nauman and
Maurice Walcott stood head and
shoulders above the competition
at West Virginia, coming away
with an exciting victory.

Head coach John Vasvary was
also very pleased with the run-
ning of the shuttle hurdle relay
team, consisting of Brett Shields,
Chop Burton, Todd Walthall and
Mark 'Twyman.

runners got to show their stuff on

For The Pitt News.

Take a sweetheart skating or
meet a valentine on ice tonight at
the Schenley Ice Rink’s Valen-
tine’s Day Party on Ice.

Live DJ Steve Lebo will spin top
40 and dance music for the
crowd. There will be contests and
prizes given away throughout the
evening.

”There has never been a party
quite like this,” said promoter
Mark Shenkan. ”It is a great way
to meet people and win prizes.”

Some of the events planned for
the evening are a limbo contest,
choosing a couple of the evening
and a sweetheart of the ice. The
first 25 women will receive a box
of chocolates.

Pitt junior Shenkan organized
the party with the intent of getting

community involvement. ”If you
want to do it right, you have to
get the local businesses in-
volved,” he said.

The prizes for the evening will
be donated by local participating
sponsors. Dinner and dessert gift
certificates will be presented by
Rax, Poli’s, Manhattan on Forbes,
B.B. Boomers and GulIifty’s
restaurants.

Heads Together and National
Record Mart donated music
prizes. Free movie passes will be
given out by Cinema World, and
giant Hershey's Kisses will be dis-
tributed throughout the evening.

Pitt, Carnegie Mellon,
Chatham, Carlow and several
other colleges have been notified
of the event. ”We also expect
several sororities and fraterni-
ties,” said Shenkan.

”There is no age limit, but it is
more or less a college party," said
Shenkan. ”So come on out and

Participants do not have to
bring a date to the ice party. A
person can always meet someone
there ”for a fun time on ice,” said
Shenkan.

”I think it will be a great time.
It will be a different kind of party.
It is on Valentine's Day, so every-

O’Sullivan won’tget
credit for world record

By Bert Rosenthal
AP Track Writer

NEW YORK — Marcus
O’Sullivan will get credit for a
track world record even
though it is not the best perfor-
mance in the event — 1,500
meters. I

The Irishman was timed in
3 minutes, 35.6 seconds en
route to winning the mile in
3:51.66 last Friday night in the
Meadowlands Invitational at
East Rutherford, N.J.

O’Sullivan’s clocking bet-
tered the accepted world
record of 3:36.03, set by Jose-
Luis Gonzalez of Spain on
March 1, 1986, at Oviedo,
Spain.

However, the record books
list three faster times than
Gonzalez’s and one faster
than O’Sul|ivan’s. ‘

The three are 3:35.4 by
O’Sullivan last year, when he
won the Meadowlands Invita-
tional in 3:50.94, and 3235.6
by Eamonn Coghlan and
3:36.0 by Steve Scott, both at
San Diego on Feb. 20, 1981.

However, none was accept-
ed as the world record, be-
cause there were an
insufficient number of official

watches taking those times.
For record purposes, there
must be at least three official
watches timing a performance.

For O’Su|Iivan’s 1,500-
meter performance a year ago,
there was only one official
timer, and for the Coghlan and
Scott race eight years ago,
there was not one official
timer.

In addition, Coghlan said he
ran 3:34.7 en route to setting
a world mile record of 3:49.78
in the 1983 Meadowlands
Mile. However, the number of
official timers also was insuffi-
cient then.

”I don't remember the situ-
ation then,” Bob Hersh,
records chairman of The Ath-
letics Congress, the national
governing body for track and
field, said Monday.

But Hersh said because of
what occurred in O’Sullivan’s
case in 1988, ”we were alert
to get the record documented
this year.

”The record will definitely
be accepted,” Hersh said of
O’Sul|ivan’s performance last
week in which he finished
with the fifth-fastest mile time
in history.

HOUSTON — They keep score
at All-Star games because some-
body has to win and somebody
has to lose. The point of these
events, though, is not the score,
but the show. _

So forget that the West beat the
East 143-134 in Sunday's NBA
convention of the best basketball
players in the world, and remem-
ber instead that one magic mo-
ment when Isiah Thomas and
Michael Jordan grabbed this
game by the lapels and took it
into their own little world, a pri-
vate place populated by precious
few mortals.

These two learned their basket-
ball in entirely different worlds,
Thomas, a product of the con-
crete courts in Chicago's inner
city, Jordan., a country kid from
rural North Carolina. Both led
their colleges to NCAA champi-
onships before movi,ng into. the
NBA early. And both share a spe-
cial sense, an understanding of
creativity and ‘spontaneity that
marks them as special.

On Sunday, for one wonderful
instant, they put it on display.

The West All-Stars were in the
midst of a record first-half scoring

THE PI1T NEWS, Tuesday, February 14, 1939

The dissection of a dunk,

surge that would produce a
31-point lead and a halftime
bulge of 87-59. The West made
60 percent of its shots in the first
24 minutes. One of the rare miss-
es, however, set off the Thomas-
Jordan show.

TWhen Akeem Olajuwon
missed a 6-foot shot in the lane,
Kevin McHale pulled down the
rebound for the East. He looped
the ball the other way and sud-
denly Thomas swooped down on
it, like a hawk dive-bombing its
prey. A step behind him was
Jordan.

There was no one back to de-
fend for the West, so the play
evolved into a two-on-none
break. It was an invitationfor two
of the game's _most innovative
players to do their thing. They did
not have to be asked twice.

Thomas caught up with the ball
and dribbled once and then again
as he advanced on the basket.
The logical thing to expect was a
layup, an easy two points. That
would be conventional. Isiah
Thomas is a lot of things. The last
one, though, is conventional.

So there was perhaps one more
dribble and then Thomas
launched a bounce pass, not to
Jordan, but to ' the basket. He
slammed the ball to the floor so
that it bounced high and kissed

‘ the backboard.

Right behind it, here came Mr.
Jordan.-

Twice before, Thomas had
tried the play and it had missed.
This time, though, Jordan was on
the fly and this time it would not
miss. _ V I

”When you're down 20 points,
it doesn't look like you have a
chance to win the game, so you
just want to entertain the fans,’f
Thomas said. ”The game is for

they had a good time. They prob-
ably saw some things they hadn't
seen before.” -

Indeed.

Jordan, it seems, has seen or
done everything before. He was
ready for Thomas’ wrinkle. He
soared toward the basket from
the right side, taking off as ‘if
propelled by jets, his tongue out.
That is a telltale sign of his c -

centration, a tip—off to pay‘ atten- . ,

tion because something special
was about to happen.

As the ball came off the board,‘

Jordan grabbed it with his right
hand in one magnificent motion.

Now he drove it down back
through the basket for a slam
dunk, the perfect marriage of
power and‘ grace, basketball’s ul-
timate exclamation point.

Newton's lawl of gravigl

brought Jordan back down to
earth, his legs spread wide, his
face contorted in the little boy

grin that told you he knew he had y I

done something special, some- .

thing above the ordinary, some-
thing All-Star games are all ‘about.

Score two points for theEasbI_t_

should have been more. You

ought to get two points for ordi- -
nary layups and jump shots. For .

what Thomas and Jordan did, two
points seemed like they had been
short-changed.

Thomas finished the game with
14 assists, several on..»baskets by
Jordan, who had 28 points. in-
cluding'“a few more of thoseﬂgfly
through the air with the greatest
of ease” shots.

I The one they'll remember best,

though, was_the two-on-none ’
when they made the ultimate.

William and Mary was second

THE NOID"
CRUSHED BY
THE NEWS

(DP) The NOID panicked,
(bonking himself on the head with
a pan!) when he heard that
Domino’s now delivers pan pizza.

New Domino’s Pan Pizza?‘ has
thick, chewy crust, generous top-
pings, and lots of thick, gooey
cheese. And it’s delivered in 30
minutes or less, guaranteed. All of
which creates pandemonium _for

the NOID. i

So call for new Domino's Pan
Pizza. When it comesto pan pizza,
