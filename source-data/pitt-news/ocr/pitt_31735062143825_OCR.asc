“Help a. student help himself"
is- the motto of the Student Loan
Committee of WSGA which will
conduct an official tag day next
Vvedncsday on the entire campus
in order to increase the funds to
be available to students seeking

The tag day represents an an-
nual event of the Student Loan

have met a generous student re-
ception.

WSGA ‘Student Loan Committee
favors student applications to the
limit of $150 a person. All re-
cipients of loans have maintained
0 averages during the year

Thus far, loans have been given
to 16 students to the extent of
$850 at the usual interest rate
of two per cent. At.pr.ese.nt there
are four times as many appli-
cations for loans as there are
funds to meet them.

ROTC Plans
Still Indeﬁnite

No Notice of Withdrawal of
Funds Received

“Like Will Rogers, all we know is
what we read in the papers," was the
reply of Lieutenant Colonel Cullen
when questioned as to whether or not

the. ROTC would. be discontinued next.

year.

There have been no official notices
from the War Department that feder-
al support will be withdrawn from
the ROTC, nor has any reply been
made" to the plan submitted through
Chancellor John G. Bowman to con-
tinue the course at the University.
The supposition that there may not
be any ROTC next year, according to
Colonel Cullen, is based entirely on
the President's attitude towards ef-
fecting economy measures.

Meanwhile, plans for the summer
camp at Fort Monroe, Virginia, which
will be attended by ﬁfty Juniors en-
rolled in the advance course, are be-
ing rounded out. The camp is sched-
uled to last from June 16 to June 27,
and will again be under the command
of Colonel Cullen.

New formal dress uniforms to be

worn at social affairs at camp have

arrived. The uniform includes tail-
ored blue trousers, side-striped in
gold, and a white close ﬁtting ‘waist-
coat. ~

Some anticipation having been ex-
pressed as to whether or not the
cadets will have the opportunity of
wearing the new uniform, depending
of course, on whether or not the sum-

1 mer camp is cancelled by the govern-

mentt, Colonel: Cullen is considering
granting his permission for the new
uniforms to ‘be worn at the Senior
ball.

If the ROTC be discontinued, the
outdoor drill this afternoon at
Ruskin Field, at which time Major E.
W’. Turner, Coast" Artillery Corps,
will make the annual inspection of the
unit, will afford the -student body
the last opportunity to see the cadets
in blue and gold on parade.

If the unit receives the rating of
"eXC911Gl1t.” the gold star which for
the ﬂrst time in many years did not
appear this last year, will again
shine from the sleeve of the blue uni-
forms.

Major Turner has been inspecting
the class periods of the Military De-
partment yesterday and today.

McKay Upholds
Roosevelt “Deal”

Outlines Banking, Farm, Security
Situations at Inquiry

“The administration in Washing-
ton is truly giving the American peo-
ple a new deal," declared Dr. Marion
K. McKay, professor and head of the
economics department, before the In-
quiry Forum Wednesday. He -spoke
on, “Meeting the Issues at Washing-

ton” in the closing group meeting of‘

the year.

Dr. McKay outlined the major legis-
lation already passed under President
Roosevelt, and pointed out its signiﬁ-
cance in relation to the other acts in
the Democratic program. “The new
banking bill," he asserted, “with its
protection in full of deposits under
$10,000, is a major step in making the
banking houses of the country safe
for you and me." He predicted
that a more uniﬁed national system
will result.

“For the farmers, President Roose-
velt aims to restore the 1909-1914
price level through a tax upon the
consumer,” said the speaker. “The
eight billion dollar burden of debt
upon American agriculture, in-the face
of a greatly lowered price level, is too
great to remove without government-
al aid."

According to Dr. McKay, “In the
future the -seller as well as the buyer
of securities will have to assume re-
sponsibility for them, under the new
security purchase regulation." Other
legislation which he discussed in-
cluded the reduction in appropria-
tions for veterans, the new railroad‘
bills with the removal of the famed

“recaptiire~clau-se...'.' and the new pol- =

icy toward the Muscle Shoals devel-
opment.

New Honorary

Jarvis, Kallfelz to Apply for
Official Recognition of
Golden Panther

 

Rose Attacks Plan

Revival of the effort to place on the
Pitt campus a second upperclass hou-
orary activities fraternity was made
this week as Robert Jarvis, Bus. Ad.
'33, and Franklin Kallfelz, Eng. '33,
sponsors of the organization to be
known as the Golden Panther, an-
nounced that they would -soon peti-
tion the Fraternity commlttee for of-
ﬁcial recognition from the University.

At present, Omicron Delta Kappa Is
the only upper class honorary activi-
ties frateriiity functioning in the Uni-
versity. An attempt was made last
November to set up a rival organiza-
tion, built along the same lines as
ODK, and existing for very nearly the
same purpose. The new group was
to be called the Golden Panther.

The attempt to form the Golden
Panther failed, according to its spon-
sors, because of the loss of interest of.‘
the students backing it,

Feeling that there is still a need for
two upper class fraternities on the
campus, Jarvis and ‘Kallfelz have
again set to work to organize and
gain- recognition for the Golden
Panther.

Several students were said by Jar-
vis and Kallfelz to be interested in
the formation of the new fraternity.
Among these were Reed Rose, Dent.

 

$33, president of Student Council dur-

ing the past year, and Arthur Gold-
berg, -Col. ’33, editor of the 1933 Owl.
Both are members of ODK.

When questioned, however, Rose
denied that he was either interested
in the group or in favor of it. He
said: “I don't believe that any or-
ganization such as the proposed
Golden Panther has a place in the
University of Pittsburgh and-" I would
certainly not be in favor of seeing an
attempt to gain recognition for it be-
ing made. I feel that. the present
honorary fraternity, ODK, amply cov-
ers the situation."

Contrary to Rose, Goldberg an-
nounced that he was in favor, with
qualiﬁcations, of the new group get-
ting recognition. He said, “If the
proposed Golden Panther is formed
with the deﬁnite idea of furnishing
competition for ODK, and of adhering
strictly to its avowed purposes, I am
strongly in favor of it. On the Other
hand, if it is to be organized just to
give a. few college boys a chance to
wear more keys and get a halo of
glory around their heads, I am against
it."

Buying Association at its _ﬁna_1 ban-

Desday night, announced as a result
Of its first year's effort the saving to
Pitt fraternities of about $2,400.

The achievement of the association
by Samuel Strauss,
general manager, in a report to mem-

Out of a total volume of $23,000

the association, according to the re-:

funding of $2,400 to fraternities with-
in the group, Fraternity indebtedness
was not increased during the year,
Strauss pointed out, and in many
cases it was reduced on account of
the refunds.

Citing the less tangible accomplish-
ments of the association, Strauss de-
clared that “we now have a buying
combine so powerful that we have
driven down prices to a considerable
degree that would not have been DOS‘i
sible without our present unity."‘
Prompt payment of bills to whole-
salers considerably increased the
credit rating of organization fraterni-
ties, he said, declaring that “after!
one year’s experience with cooper-
ative buying we can safely say that
there is not one dealer who would
not be more than willing to serve us
again next year.”

Strauss deprecated the action of;
fraternities who patronized dealers op- '
posing the Cooperative Buying Asso-

lishment of the fraternity, stated:

"The purpose of organizing this-
fraternity is to foster activities, lead.
ership, and scholarsliip. It should be-
not only an activities fraternity but
311 Organization whereby the mem-
bers of it can not only better them-
selves but also promote the interests
of the University. The organization
will be non-politica.l in cllaracter. The
students at Pitt should be ashamed of
themselves for only Dromoting two
honorary activities fraternities, Druids
and ODK, whereas in other schools,
much smaller in size, t.here are three
or more."

Jarvis said, “It. is about time that
the students here foster a real hon-
orary activities frateruity run by un-
dergraduate members where tapping
of new members is concerned. This
new organization. has been sanctioned
and endorsed by members and non-
members of other fraternities on the
campus,

“Pitt is about the only large Univer-
sity in the East which has only one
upper class honorary activities frater-

nity. The spirit of competition among
honoraries is a real factor in the
progress of activity leaders on the

campus of other colleges, Pitt needs
another upper class honorary activi-
ties fraternity, an organization that
co.uld carry on a constructive program
of work, an organization that will do
something besides tap new members.”

According to the prospective con-
stit-.u-tion, members of the Golden
Panther will have to be juniors or
seniors, shall liave to attain superior
records in u.ctivities,_ and shall have
to possess a superior scholastic aver-
age, “at least a ‘C’ average.”

The orgaiiization will differ from
ODK in ttliat only undergraduate mem-
bers will be allowed to vote upon the
tapping of new members, ODK grad-
uate members being permitted to vote
upon new members, Jarvis said.

The organization will give honorary
me.mbersl1ips to men who have ren-
dered outstanding service to the Uni-
versity, whether or not they “are or
have been associated" with the insti-
tution.

Examinations

The Student Health Service

nounced yesterday by Dr. Clifford
Carlson, director, The examina-
tion is part of the program of the
Health Service, in which it is in-
tended to give periodic health ex-
aminations to students.

Dr. Carlson stressed the value
of such an examination at the
time when students will be start-
ing out to make a living which
will require that they are in ﬁt

condition. It may be a means of
discovering some physical weak-
ness which can be quickly cured
if caught early, but would offer
stubborn resistance if not detect-

Keeping‘ Pitt in China

URPASSING the pessimist-ic expectations of its sponsoring com-
mittee, the Pitt-in-China drive conducted on campus Wednesday
gives -.caxly indica.tions.ofexceeding-the return of last ,_vear’s similar
campaign. lVith the results of personal solicitation among adminis-
tration and faculty inembers yet to come in, the student drive itself
shows a. “return” in undergraduate interest that is more impressive
than the actual ﬁfty-four dollars collected.

This week’s drive could not have been conducted under more
discouraging conditions. From the time the question of whether the
University was to break with this traditional exchange ﬁrst. came
up. cccn its willing student and a.dn1inistral:ion sponsors were doubt-
ful of success. “ ' ‘ '

Certain they were that little ﬁnancial support could be expected
from a. student body that has been strained to its limit since the time
of the drive. last year, when an amount consiclerably less than one
hundred dollars was received. But hearing of the work being done
at Lingnan University under conditions far worse than those felt
at home, the sponsors felt that the opportunity for continued sup-
port of the .three.Pitt reprcsc.nt.ati,vcs in Canton should not be denied.

A contribution of approximately seventy-ﬁve dollars is- expected
to be the ﬁnal ﬁgure for the combined drives. And although this
ﬁgure is scarcely one-third the amount necessary to maintain one of
the University’s three facult_v members at Lingnan next year, the
ex-prcs.s-ion" o.l'*“inte1'n'atirm’al‘goodwill” which accompanies the gift
may go far toward making up for the deﬁcit.

To Charles Siedle, Dr. Henry Frank and Dr. Franklin Karcher,
our graduates at Lingnan, the knowledge that such a feeling and
continued interest exists on the campus of their Alma ll-later will
undoubtedly mean much. It appears that the conﬁdence which may
have been responsible for the promotion of the drive was not mis-
placed. Certainly, Wedncsday’s success must be credited with sav-
ing a tradition and a responsibility from the unfair onslaught of

spiritual depression.
A NOTHER Xylon Day brings; into view the work that is being
done on the Univcrsit_v campus and in the high schools of the
Pittsburgh district by women in journalism. Today, representatives
-of ﬁfteen high schools, each of which has its own student pub-
‘lication, are meeting with members of Xylon, honorary journalistic
fraternity for women, and are learning a little more about the ﬁeld
tvhich so completely claims their interest.
" , In bringing together these younger women to hear prominent
newspaper men and women from our metropolitan dailies speak of
the aims, problems and ideals; of the profession, and to learn some-
thing of what is being done by others on their own level, Xylon fu1- I
ﬁlls a. real. need of the community.

More and more women are considering the ﬁeld of journalism
with a serious eye. Every day, increasing numbers of them mount
the unsteady ladder that leads to the. topmost positions. of responsi-
bility. But even the openin-g~ ‘of the gates to the -gentler sex cannot
remove the handicap that existslfor them in a ‘lack of technical
knowledge, something which comes more naturally to their male
competitors. ‘ C A ‘

Xylon, sponsoring a newspaper contest ’for"high7Schools and
awarding a cup each year to the winner, oﬁers invaluable assistance
to these up-and-coming reporters and editors in their becoming more
familiar with all phases of newspaper work. H

Equally important, the fraternity contributes something ofvalue
to the University and its department of journalism in helping to

One can easily picture the tearful

been reluctant to buy his bombers

the juicy commissions he gives his
salesmen, whose business it is .to

In the Louis Quinze drawing room
of the airplane manufacturer's pent
house, his family sits with hungry
eyes, not knowing where they will
find the money for next week's- bread.
One son wants to continue his studies
of a former show girl whom he has‘
housed in an uptown apartment. An-
other son, after two diligent years of
research in night clubs, josh houses,
and brothels, is on speaking terms
with practically all the toughs in the
city in which he resides. He would

The Awful Future

The father thiplts of what will hap-
pen if this happy little family group
is broken. And as his mind runs to
the budget cuts Roosevelt proposes
for the Army and the Navy, he mum-
bless to himself, “False Economy!”

Economy, especially {is applied to”
~armies"‘a‘ij'd ‘nffviés, has "always been"
a horrid word to this airplane manu-
facturer. Often he and his friend,
the steel manufacturer, have talked
until early morning of the best safe-
guards against war. And always they
have agreed that the best guarantee
against war is preparedness for it.

Our airplane manufacturer wonders
if, perhaps. he should spend a little
on the Yellow Menace. He might
throw a big scare into the people on
the west coast if be concentrated his
forces on the danger which Japan of-
fers in the Paciﬁc.

For under his very eyes he sees
the Europe he knew and loved
crumbling. He sees Roosevelt de-
manding a revision of the Treaty of
Versailles. He sees France, pushed
to the wall,» acl-mitr.ing- a. revision. He-
sees. worse than all that. a. general
reduction of armaments and armies
throughout Europe.

There are left a. few sore spots.
The Polish Corridor can always be
counted on for trouble. And treaties

will eventually be broken. But for
the present, the airplane manufac-
turer has fallen on evil days. Count-

ing heavily o-n a war right now, he
has seen it postponed. intern9’rinnni
friction spots oiled, and the ﬁghting
spirit of the Continent deadened.
Good and Bad Intervention

I am not sufficiently trustf-ul of
European governments to believe
that the results of Hitler's ‘Wednes-
day Reichstag speech will be per-
manent peace or anything like it. Eu-
rope is too much of a diplomatic mess
to hope that difficulties can be ironed
out to the satisfaction of all‘ parties
concerned.

But we have seen inthe events "of
this‘ week an attempt at peace whose
results are certainly to be better than
those of no attempt at all. It should
be clear that Roosevelt must, if he
is to be consistent, continue his in-
terest in European aﬁairs, and at-
-tempt some adjustment of them at
the Disarmament and World Eco-
nomic Conferences. This is the open-
ly admitted end of American isola-

To die Editor, Pitt News:

o  Letters From Readers 0

The time has come to come to the defense of the defenseless,
underweight, seemingly silly co-ed.

There are so many incomprehensibkv 11ns_vn1pa.thetic., 1u1can1pus- .

minded, and—plainly speaking—stupid newspaper reporters aliroad
in Pittsburgh and preying on the over-newsy co-ed that folks must
have a mighty snappy impressipn of Pitt girls by now.

It is, therefore, time to speak right up and declare what ought to  5,1‘-‘-139

be just plain obvious:
and foremost, go to school. Inter-
viewers, Who write illuminating ar-
ticles on co-ed kissing, co-ed attit.11de
toward men, co-ed devotion to terps1-
chore_ and co-ed physiology, over-
look entirely, it seems, the somewhat
important fact that if these co-eds
didn't go to school they wouldn’t be
-“co-eds" and, therefore, wouldn't be
news! .

It is to be hoped that some of the
higher-ups on the newspapers---who
actually must have some intelligence
.—--will some day read some of ‘these
inane co-ed interviews their satellites
write and will get wise to the.laugh-
able hisli-hosh with which their‘othe1'-
wise erudite papers are freighted.

A co-ed isn't always 3. silly sap,
such as she is invariably made. to ap-
pear in certain newspaper features.
She, incidentally, goes to school; and
she might even have interesting ideas
that are commendable and substan-
tial. These worth-while ideas could
be discovered if reporters had the
wit, intel1igence——and inclination-to
turn interviews with her in that di-
rection. -

But. “Do you ‘kiss boys?" “How
much does the doctor say you should
weigh?” “Does dancing give you
pains in the neck?” “What do you
think of sweat shops?”

Oh, well!

Yours truly,
AL AVOIRDUPOIS.

To the Editor, Pitt News:

Your recent editorial entitled “And
Still More Keys" was certainly inter-
esting. Your-said that “the College
Association, campus group whose
chief function in the past has been
to sponsor two dances each semester
and let things go at that, alters its
by-laws to permit the aw3a.1-ding” of

_...._.

“keys to oﬁicé‘i‘"s and ca.binetmembers.”

The “let things go at that” part of
the quotation is of primary interest to
me. I

VVhat other organization on the
campus gives two major functions
each semester at the low price of
$2.00? VVhat other student group or
committee reverts the -proﬁts of its
affairs into a student loan fund as
does the College Association? ‘What
other organization makes loans to
needy students without the payment
of interest? The College Association
has been operating in the interests of
the student body of the College since
its founding in 1926 by Dean L. P,
Sieg. Its e-ﬁiciency in conducting
school dances and its willingness to
aid the needy student
little‘ if"a'n‘y"attention by the “oiﬁcial
student publication.” Thus the aver-
age student does "not know the true
purpose of the organization. But
you, Mr. Editor, being a member
of the cabinet of the Association, are
supposed to knowbits aims and ideals.
Apparently you have not wished to
take the opportunity to avail yourself
of this knowledge,

The truth is tinit the College Asso-
ciation is the only successful philan-
thropic student organization at the
University. And its success is in-
creasing from year to year.

To those students who have given
their faithful service it has been de-
cided to award keys. These keys are
the concrete symbols of their Work.
Keys, after all, are perhaps among
the few tangible reminders of one's
college days. Therefore the purpose
was not to “encourage, a needed in-
terest among the members.” Interest
has not been lagging among the ma-
jority of the members. If the College
Association is to be ridiculed for this
presentment of keys, every other or-
ganization and society on the campus
should likewise be condemned.

It seems strange, Mr. Editor, that
you as a member of the executive
board of the “Pitt News" have not
advocated the abolition of that or-
ganization’s gold key, Perhaps your
statement that “if there is not enough
interest among the s;i;udents of the

Collegepto carry on what little work ve-rsity Cafeteria and a tea dance ‘at
there is to be done in the association the Heinz House.

without being paid off in enamel and
lettered gold, there probably is not
enough interest to warrant continuing
the organization in its present status"
applies with greater force to the “Pitt
News." The “Pitt News” must pay
huge salaries, besides the awarding of
gold keys, to its editorial and busi-
ness heads in order to stimulate much
needed interest. Your servlceis be-
ing paid for in gold dollars, Mr.
Editor! ,
Sincerely yours,
Robert A. Jarvis, Col. ’33.

nounced this week, after a meeting of
the Executive committee of the Board

award scholarships only to graduate
students,

Miss Virginia Lewis, Col. '31, who
will receive free tuition and an hon-
orarium of $500 as a scholarship, has
been appointed to a fellowship in the
-department. Since her graduation in
