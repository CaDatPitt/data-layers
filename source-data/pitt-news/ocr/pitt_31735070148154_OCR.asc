Pitt unveils
plans for

new dorm

Emily Marmion
Staﬁ’ Writer

The city approved on Tuesday a
proposal to put a new 578-bed
dorm in the center of Pitt’s cam-

pus, and plans to begin construc— 1‘

tion are now under way.

The approval comes during-

an academic year in which the
University had’ to house students
in the local Wyndham Hotel and
at another college, as well as in
converted lounges. The University
must weigh its decision to build

. amidst the threat of an impending

state budget cut. ‘

The approval — ﬁrst from the
Historic Review Commission and
the Zoning Board of Adjustments
and now from the city Planning
Commission —gives ‘Pitt the go-
ahead to demolish the building
at 121 University Place, near the
intersection of University Place
and Fifth Avenue. The"-building
currently holds offices for The

University Center for Social and '

Urban Research, as well as larger
meeting spaces. » V T «

Inits place will be a yet—to—be-
named dorm that will hold retail
space on its ﬁrst level. The Stu-
dent Health Center, currently in
the Medical Arts Building, and the
University Counseling Center, cur-

rently in the William Pitt Union,

might move to the new dorm’s sec-
ond ﬂoor, said Eli Shorak, associ-

ate vice chancellor for business "

at Pitt. The remaining ﬂoors — 3
to 11 — will be residential, and
the rooms will be mainly doubles,
with triples on the end of the hall-
ways.

and the introduction of gun ownership bills
in a number of state legislatures.

Kicking off the debate was a discussion ,

focusing on how effective the lost or stolen
handgun ordinance was in a municipality,
and whether it could reduce straw purchas-
es, when someone buys a gun for someone
else who isn’t allowed to for himself.

Pittsburgh City Councilman Bruce Kraus,
who has sponsored legislation to crack down
on the illegal spread of ﬁrearms, said he
believes stricter regulation will protect city
residents.

“Illegal handguns have been ﬂooding the

streets for years,” he said to the crowd.

In rebuttal, Kim Stolfer, panelist and

chairman of the Firearms Owners Against
Crime political action committee, encour-
aged the audience to “remember their free-
doms,” and stressed that legislators need
to focus on targeting criminals — not law-

" abiding citizens. .

“Lost or stolen ordinance is a facade to
make you think they are doing something
about crime —— but they are not,” Stolfer
said.

The discussion veered toward personal
attacks at some points during the hour—and—

Dormto have beds for

Dorm 4 1

 more than 500 freshmen

Demolition of the current building on"
University Place will begin in June or July
this summer, Shorak said. The construction
of the new dorm will begin injuly or August,
pending the additional approval from the
city’s Public Works‘ Department. Shorak
expects the construction of the building to
take about two years, meaning the residence

hall should open at the conclusion of the g

2013 summer, in time to house incoming
freshmen.

Making the decision to build
After Republican Gov. Tom Corbett pro-

posed in his budget to cut the state’s higher
education funding by half, Pennsylvania

' universities began discussing how they

would cut back.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg already
told students their tuition will rise next year.
Last week, Penn State University’s Board of
Trustees voted to halt all new construction
projects, pending the governor’s proposed
cuts. Penn State, like Pitt, faces a potential
halving of its appropriation.

In light of «potential cuts, sophomore

. Ryan Bruno said that the University should

reconsider building the new dorm.

“Considering current budget issues,
maybe the University should hold ofl'build-
ing the dorm, unless its ultimately cheaper
than keeping some students housed in ho-
tels and on other campuses,” he said.

Pitt receives some state money for con-
struction projects but money for those proj-
ects comes separate from the funding that is
meant to keep in-state tuition lower.

Vice Chancellor Shorak said student
housing fees will pay for the construction

of the new dorm and maintenance of the

' building.

Sophomore Diana Vose said that a new

dorm is essential to accommodate the gr_ow— ,

ing number of Pitt students. ,

“Building the new dorm is necessary for
the amount of students Pitt is accepting
every year,” she said. . _ ‘

Shorak, said that the Planning Commis-
sion conﬁrmed that the new building is a
part of Pitt’s master plan to accommodate
more students and to better use the site
where the old building is now.

The new building will come an additional '

crosswalk and a signal at the corner of Uni-
versity Place and Fifth Avenue, decision

- that was made after a traffic study found

that “the intersection is dangerous,” Shorak
said.

The number of students living on campus
has increased by more than 1,000 over the
past 10 years with the expansion of Bouquet
Gardens and the construction of Panther
Hall and Pennsylvania Hall.

In the fall of 2012, there will be 7,400
beds on campus, including the expansion
of Bouquet Gardens scheduled for comple-
tion this summer, Shorak said. That num-
ber represents about 44 percent of Pitt’s
undergraduate, full-time student popula-
tion. The numbers will continue to increase
in the fall of 2013 with the opening of the
new 578-bed dorm. Forty-seven percent of
full-time Pitt students will have access to
on-campus housing.

Shorak said that the construction of the
new dorm will be beneﬁcial in the long run
for the University. I

“This [building] is critical for the future
success of the University,” Shorak said. I

Students to study in Japan

could go into meltdown. '

Asjapan operates on a diiferent academic
schedule, the students there were in the middle
of the school year injapan when the 8.9-magni-
tude earthquake and ensuing tsunami hitjapan
two weeks ago. '

Despite the University’s recommendation,
some students who are currently injapan saythey
plan to staythere. ’

. Junior Alana Swisshas also decided that she
will continue her studies injapan. She sent an
e-mail to friends and family to explain that she
issafe. -

Sheisinthe southern region ofjapan, studying
at‘Konan University in Kobe.

Swiss packed up a few of her belongings and
boughta plane ticketto Australiafortwo weeks of
vacation after the University recommended that
students leavejapan. But she left most of her be-
longings because she intends to return April 8.

“My town has been continuing life as nor-
mal, [and] you don’t see people running for the‘
airport here or acting out of the ordinary at all,”
she said. a

Junior Olivia Vareha, who lives‘ in Kyoto and
is studying at Ritsumeikan University, said in an
e-mail that she will remain injapan.

David Mills, anassociate professor otjapanese
language and  at Pitt, saidthatit’s bestfor

' students to study injapan if “they really want to

leamthe language.” He said the students’ inability
to study abroad is a concern. ~

“I certainly hope that they are not abandon-
ing study abroad,” Mills said. “It’s just that with
the situation right now injapan, a lot of people
areworried.” , '

Japan is the only‘country in the world whose
population primarily  Japanese, so Mills
said students who want to stuc_ly_]apanese would
have ditﬁculty ﬁnding an immersion experience
anywhere else. _ ~ - V

In normal circumstances, the Japanese lan-
guage department offers a summer intensive
program for students who might not be able to
go tojapan to arduously use their language skills.
Students can also take intensive language pro-
grams at other universities for credit.

Besides reﬁninglanguage skills, Mills saidthat
studying abroad teaches a lot about culture and
communicating with native speakers. The first
time he traveled tojapan, Mills said that he had
trouble reading signs written injapanese.

“Whathappensisthat moststudents —when

they haven’t studied it very much — is that they .
S A go tojapan and suddenly find themselves on the '
A street comer, and they ﬁnd themselves being il-

literate,” Mills said.

Mills said the temporary cancellation of the

from studyinglapanese. Helsaid that most students

Little reward in
degree inflation

onvincing yourself‘ that
‘ you’re competing doesn’t
make you competitive.
Surely ringing true for job can-
didates and entrepreneurs, this
message more pressingly applies
to America’s educational future.
Policymakers, both state and fed-
eral, best keep this in mind.
On Tuesday, Vice President
Joe Biden unveiled a White House
plan to directly engage state

governors in federal efforts to

raise college graduation rates.
The administration’s goal is to
graduate more college students
per capita than any other country
by 2020, and he wants state lead-
ers to begin the push by hosting
“graduation summits.” Biden said
that would require increasing the
percentage of 20- to 34-year-olds
with bachelor’s degrees 16 points,
from the current 42 percent to 58
percent, that of South Korea.
Call for collegiate concern is
undoubtedly warranted. Ameri-
cans spend $400 billion on
higher education per year, but

four-year undergraduate pro— _

grams graduate less than half
of‘ students within six years, ac-
cording to the Harvard Gradu-
ate School of Education’s report,
“Pathways to Prosperity Project.”
And the study puts completion
rates at U.S. two-year institutions
in a darker light — just 30 per-
cent walk out in caps and gowns
within three years.

The prospect of once again
sampling the sweet taste of edu-
cational pre-eminence is surely
glamorous, perhaps edging on
intoxicating. But we’re not im-
pressed.

It’s not only the Harvard- re-
searchers who deem a goal like
President Barack Obama’s ad-
ministration’s — increasing the

proportion of degree-holding
young people almost 2 percent
per year — impossible. Even if we
could conceivably expect a joint
federal-state coalition to deliver
on such a herculean undertaking,
we think ﬂooding the land with
college diplomas would neglect
larger problems. It’s one thing
to support college students once
they enroll, but it’s another to
reform the classrooms they sit
in before they ever learn what
SAT stands for.

Speciﬁcally, any kind of edu-
cational “summits” thatjoe Biden
drags governors to must also ad-
dress K—12~education — the K-12
decadence is what’s depressing
college graduation rates, anyway.
From our perspective, progress
in our country’s primary and sec-
ondary schools is slowed by five
primary evils: demographic—de-
pendant educational inequality,
improperly administered stan-
dardized testing (No Child Left
Behind), a changing employment
landscape, a growing —— though
of course baseless and dangerous
— public distrust of educators
and a nationwide resistance to
the "idea that maybe college isn’t
“for everyone.”

GOOD GOLLY MISS MOLLIE

Don’t be fooledby ‘thinspiration’

Mollie Durkin
Contributing Editor

Being unhealthily thin isn’t just men-
tally and physicallyharmﬁil — it’s also
out of style. _ ’
Lastweek, Vogue Italia -- the Ital-
ian version of Vogue magazine that
wasfeatured onlastseason’s “America’s
Next Top Mode ” —— laimched a cam-

paign against pro-eating-disorder

blogs. These sites are all over the In-
ternet, and theyfeature waiﬁshbodies

that glamorize starvation and jutting A

bones thatserveasasouroe of inspira-
tion, or “thinspiration.”

The magazine has teamedup with
the NationalEatingDisordersAssocia-
tion in the United States to ﬁght these
blogs, which might include instruc-
tions on how to become anorexic and
contain catalogs of miniscule caloric
intake and food diaries.

Vogue ItaliaEditor-.in—ChiefFranca
Sozzani said on her blog on Friday,

“Fashion has been always blamed as ‘

one ofthe culprits ofanorexia, and our
commitmentis the proof thatfashion
is ready to get on the frontline and
struggle against the disorder.”

section, which is littered with many

diﬁ'erentlanguages,butthe same mes-
sage: support.
At ﬁrst, it seems counterintuitive

thatamajorfashionoutletis speaking .

Before I tell you to click on over to
thewebsite and sign the petition, I sug-
gest you check out a “thinspiration”
blog yourself.

Simplytypingthe term “thinspira-
tion blog” into Google does the trick:
What_a_girl_eats.webs.com is a self-
described pro—anorexia blog. Upon
entering, there is a disclaimerwarning

ingthe diseasewith photos and 

it “beautiful” can cause a recovering

site itself admits — and discourages

current sufferers from seeking addi-

Some websites have links or side-
bars that feature certain body parts,
like ribs, pelvic bones, breastbones
and cheekbones. They break men
andwomen down into lit1le bony com-
partments, analyze them and idolize

. them. It’s almost scientiﬁc and inhu-

man. Those featured seem unhappy,

unsatisﬁedandontheverge ofsickness

' or even death. But they’re divine to an
entire community ofbloggers.

Aside from the widespread dis-
gust that “thinspiration” blogs have
spawned, other responses have been
more constructive. First, “ﬁtspiration”
blogs feature toned, healthy bodies as
inspiration for necessary weight loss.
This is an admirable community,
existing to help people looking for a
supportive and inspirational group
of friends to keep pushing on to be
healthy. These blogs feature athletes,
celebrities andthe progress of aver-

weight loss. ’

Prospective students: Revise your expectations

Alicia Dlugos
For The Pitt News

Exactly one year ago, Iwas alowly high
school senio_r on springbreak visiting
Pitt for the ﬁrst time. .

I was that kid being snickered at
by current students for eating at Mar-
ket Central with my dad. I remember
being fascinated by the fact that the
Cathedral ofLearriing, in reality, does
not hold church services of any kind.
I also remember being blown away
thatl couldwalkto classes through the
bridge that connects Posvar Hall with
Towers patio and being determined
to get that extra green OCC tassel at
graduation, although that’s not going
too well so far.

But as I sit here — fully awake at 2
am like the professional college stu-
dent thatl am — I realize that none
of my expectations of what freshman
year of college would be like were met.
This is not because Pittfailed to adver-

‘ tise itselfcorrectly or because I hate it

here — quite the contrary, actually!
— but because I had the completely
wrong idea of how college would be.

So,tothehighschoolseniorsonspiing .

break readingthis or to the parents of
prospective students, I present to you
the good, the bad and the caffeinated:
expectations versus reality of life as a

Pitt freshman.

Expectation: “Wow, only 10 per-
cent ofthe campus is involved in Greek
Life. I bet I’ll never even see a real—live
ﬁat guy, let alone have anything to do
with a ‘frat party.” ‘

Reality: When colleges advertise
thataceitain percentage ofthe student
body is involved inGreek life, that per-
centage only accounts for those who

are actually members of a ﬁaternity '

or sorority. What is not mentioned,
however, is the impact Greek life has
on°much of the freshman class —— by
my calculations — at least during the
ﬁrst semester. Because really, during
the ﬁrstfewweeks of school, no fresh-
man knows of any place for weekend
ﬁin other than “up on the hill.” I’rn not
bashing theGreek system here at all
— it’sjustthatI arrived at college with
the idea of a “ﬁat party” categorized
as sometliinglwould only witness on

TV, and inthe end, this siniplywas not '

the case. ,

Expectation: “There are 500
people in my class? Sounds perfect
— no participation grade, they don’t
take attendance, and I can easily text
during class!” ~ .

Reality: Last semester, three out
of my five courses had more than 200
students enrolled, and I couldn’t have
been more thrilled. I could show up
to class late, and no one noticed or

cared. I could even bringimy laptop
and bop around on Facebook for 50
minutes. To my surprise, however, I
found myselfbecoming less and less
motivated in these classes as the se-
mesterprogressed. I stopped goingto
class, I relied too heavily on the online
notes, and I missed having the extra
boostfromaparticipationpercentage

someone could have warned me of the

would have gotten better grades ifI had

initially seem, you might not be bet- \

Expectation: “With ample public
transportation, I’m going to spend so
much time exploring the city. Pitts-
burgh is at my ﬁngertips!”

Reality: Don’t get me wrong % I

think our Port Authority bus access
is highly convenient. I probably take

does its best, but it simply cannot be
compared to the great public trans-
portation systems of late.
Expectation: ‘All-nighters, every
night. Just like the movies. Can’t wait
Reality: This reality, ﬁnally, is bet-
tertlianwhatl expected. Ifyou’re stay-
ingup allnight doing homework more
thanonce ortwice amonth, something
iswrong. I’ll admit, Iwillnever have to
take Organic Chemistry or Advanced
Calculus 3 for Engineers, if that even
exists, but all college students — re-

gardless oftheirmajors——-willlearnto
effectivelybalance theirtime between
work, play and sleep. Some nights will
beworsethanothers, but eventhough
there is a lot more work in college,
there is also a lot more time than in
high school to ﬁnish the work.

Expectation: “I can’t imagine ever
being tired of this cafeteria food. So
many choices, all the time! Freshman
15, here I come.”

Reality: This issue is very near and
dear to my heart, as I do love food.

l When I ﬁrst visited Pitt for an open

house and then again for Pittstart, I
was really blown away by the variety of
cuisine. Even duringtlieﬁrsttwoweeks
of my ﬁrst semester, I genuinely en-

. joyed goingto Market Central. As the

semester progressed, I found myself
becoming accustomed to and eventu-

ally tired of the meal plan offerings. I

reallydon’t meanto callout Sodexo be-

cause I really do appreciate their hard

work, but sometimes you just need to

venture off campus to ﬁnd variety.

Of course, each studentwill have a
different experience diiringfreshman
year. All I can hope is that prospective
students will take a step back before
prematurely limiting themselves be-
cause of ill-informed college expecta-
tions.

DATING COLUMN

Randi Alu
Staff Writer

I’m a girl who knows her way
around Google, who knows how

to study with SparkNotes and ‘

who can explain the term “In—
ternet meme” to an octogenar-
ian. So, with wounds still fresh
from heartbreak and a desire
to bounce back into the dating
world , I looked to the Internet to
solve my problems. And I found
OkCupid.

OkCupid is a free online—
dating website that breaks away
from the social stigma of what a
“dating site” and its community
really are.

I’ve looked at other dating
sites, but with my scanty in-
come, it’s hard to justify eHar-
mony’s fee of $59.95 for one
month, or $19.95 per month for

12 months.

When one of my best friends
first suggested that I make an
OkCupid account, I giggled and

rolled my eyes, but I let him help _

me make one, ﬁguring I’d delete
it soon. But I didn’t. _
My time in the OkCupid com-
munity, has taught me that the la-
bel “dating site” is far too narrow
of a term to describe it. There
are a vast number of people on-
line there: single, taken, sexually
active or not, lonely or busy, "all
with different goals and wishes.

Some of them aren’t even looking _

for dates.

As for me, I’m not needy or
desperate like many dating site
stigmas would imply. I’ve met
guys outside of OkCupid who
want to date me, sleep with me
or just have pleasant conversa-
tions. But I haven’t'found anyone
who has caught my attention, so

Hollywood says goodbye to most beautifulwoman

Actress Elizabeth Taylor, who was often called the most beautiful woman in the world, died yesterday at the-age of 79

Natalie Bell
A5‘E Editor

Yesterday, the American movie
industry lost one of its royals ——
the strikingly beautiful Elizabeth
Taylor, who died of congestive
heart failure at the age of 79.

For seven decades, Taylor cap-
tivated movie audiences with her
curvaceous figure, violet eyes,
ﬁlm-worthy romances and chari-
table endeavors. She undoubted-
ly enchanted the public not only
because of her acting prowess
— she won the Oscar for Best
Actress twice — but because of
the manner in which she led her
life: with great and unabashed
passion.

The lady once christened “the
most beautiful woman in the

world” was by no means perfect.
She was criticized for the ups and
downs of her weight and for her
very public love affairs.

But if there is anything we can
appreciate about Elizabeth Tay-
lor, it’s that she did everything
in a big, theatrical way — while
maintaining her poise and like-
ability. .

She dallied with famous, pow-
erful and high-proﬁle men and is
well—known for her eight mar-

riages to seven men’, marrying -

actor Richard Burton twice. Her
love affair with Burton during
the ﬁlming of “Cleopatra,” while

-the actors were both married,

caused a scandal that warranted
a reproach from the Vatican.
One can’t help but admire a
woman who, when asked by The
New York Times why she had

chosen to marry so many times,
put on a Southern accent and
responded with: “I don’t know,
honey. It sure beats the hell out
of me.”

best known was a 69.42-carat
diamond gifted by then-husband
Burton.

Still,_ she wouldn’t have mes-

merized the public with her

DebbieReynolds, to Entertainment Weekly:
Women liked her and men
adored her - my husband
included — and her love for
her children is enduring.

I-Ier jewelry collection could
almost be considered America’s
own crown jewels. Gems glitter
from her ears. and throat in near-

ly every picture of her. One of her '

personal life were it not for her
acting career. Her career started

at the age of 9 and she transi- ’

tioned smoothly from child-actor
to a ﬁlm star through her adult-

hood, winning the Best Actress
Oscarfor roles in “BUtterfield

8” and “Who’s Afraid of Virginia 5‘

Woolf?”

Even after she no longer
graced the silver screen, she used
her celebrity to advocate support
for the fight against HIV/AIDS.
She co—founded and chaired the
American Foundation for AIDS
Research and was honored‘sev-
eral times for her philanthropy.

After her death, Entertain-
ment‘Weekly spoke with Debbie

Reynolds about Taylor. Reynolds V

and Taylor had been friends when
an affair began between enter-
tainer Eddie Fisher, Reynolds’
husband at the time, and Taylor.

Still, the pair eventually recon- -

ciled and Reynolds could only‘
speak highly of the actress.

I frequently ﬁnd myself sweating in my living

three years since she’s been living off campus.

“As soon as _I moved off campus sophomore
year, I didn’t have a gym that was easy to walk
to, so I started gaining weight,” she said. “I saw
the infomercials and knew somepeople who had
used P9.oX and gotten good re_sults, so I decided
to give ita try.” ‘

Altmire enjoys thattheworkouts are different
each day, focusing on different muscle groups. In
addition, she likes the convenience ofnot havingto
travel to the gym — especially in the winter.

A three- to eight-pound weight and a mat, if
you’re exercising on a hard surface,.are needed
for the workout. But Michaels advises beginners
to modify the workout by performing it without

‘the weight. Since I’m.so hardcore, I chose to do

the workout without a mat and with a 1o—pound
kettle bell. Yeah, that didn’t last long. ‘

Michaels recommends performing the workout

The most impressive thingabout“6 Week Six-

standard moves like the basic crunch and sit up. I
appreciate this because I don’t need a $15 DVD to
show me how to do crunches and sit—ups. Instead,
Michaels mixes cardio and weight-trainingmoves

World politics bad for ﬁlm villains

MCT Campus‘

»

“Red Dawn” ﬁlmmakers have decided to change their nemesis to North Korea — after
ﬁlming the whole movie with a Chinese villain.

A Andy Tybout
Assistant At-‘.«E Editor

 

When the new “Red Dawn” hits _theaters, its pro-
tagonists will likely be as gung—ho and American
as ever. The villains, however, might suffer from
identity crises. ' . -

As any action movie buff will tell you, the
upcoming “Red Dawn” remake has had a long
and setback-ridden production. Most notably,
China, the ﬁlm’s designated arch-villain, was
recently deemed an invaluable source of movie
and entertainment revenue and thus too impor-
tant to alienate. Accordingly, the Los Angeles
Times reported, MGM studios is now pulling
an unprecedented last—minute overhaul: The
new invaders, they’ve decided, aren’t Chinese

' — they’re North Korean.

In some ways, this repositioningis practical.
The miserly East Asian country has a restrictive
economy, posing no threat toﬁlm sales, and its
leader is so transparently insane he can serve
as an antagonist in nearly any context. In fact,

North Korea has been and continues to be a fa-
vorite Hollywood villain: ﬁlms like “Die Another

Day” (2002) and “Team America: World Police” ’

(2004) delightinvanquishingthe nationinahail
of righteous gunﬁre. (Video games are even more
unrepentant about this — see “Mercenaries,” a
beloved centerpiece of my adolescence). A

' There’s just one problem: The “Red Dawn”
remake has already been ﬁlmed. This means
ﬁlmmakers will have to doctor their footage
to erase as many Chinese insignias as possible,
alter dialogue to reﬂect North Korean instead
of Chinese enemies andingeneral superimpose
North Korean characteristics onto Chinese ones.
Of course, there’s no way to alter the faces of
actors to appear more Korean, but in these situ-
ations, Hollywood’s casting system rarely takes
into account speciﬁc nationality anyway.

This might be premature of me, but I pre-
dict the “Red Dawn” remake will be a complete
quagmire —- and not just because this sort of
cinematic plastic surgerywillrender convoluted
visuals. Rather, the ﬁlm will  because its
villain’s identity is superﬂuous.

OkCupid 4 10

I turned to a larger pool of potential dates
and friends.

But I can see the shame of online dating
still sticks. In my experience, most entries
under “The Most Private Thing Ifm Willing
to Admit”. section of members’ proﬁles
read, “That I have an OkCupid account.”

But this site is just like a lot of social
networking sites. It”s set up almost like

Facebook, except instead of “fri‘ending”p

people you know, you meet new people.
After signing in, the homepage has a “Re-

cent Activity” list — similar to the “News .

Feed” —— that shows updates’ from locals.
Above that are pictures of people within
the age and gender parameters that you
have speciﬁed that-y  re looking for in
a “match.” 7  ’  I ’

Speciﬁcations of who exactly youare

 

looking for. can have a wide variety of _

combinations.

My speciﬁcation is “Everybody, Ages ‘

19-23, Near me, For, new friends.” It has
brought all kinds: a girl looking for a part-
ner to write a blog about movies, classic
date invites, casual sex seekers, even a
soldier being deployed to Afghanistan
wanting a pen pal. _ -

There are a few creeps on there, but I
can assure you that most of the people I’ve

   

 
 
  
 
 
 

come into contact with have been interest-
ing, kind people.

. To ﬁndmatches, you answer some -of
the mostly user-created questions to re-
veal what’s important to you. Together,
members have answered more than 150

, million questions. From that, OkCupid

selects potential matches who answered
similarly, showing their compatibility per-

Simple rules keep users safe on Okcupidi

and some of these can be viewed in the

' “Treasures” section of the website. Ibe-

lieve these stories wholeheartedly, con-
sidering the fun people I have met from
their recommendations.

I realize a lot of people ﬁnd it scary
to meet someone they found online. But
it’s the same thing as meeting a guy at a

bar or party, except you’re sober and can

centage next to their profile picture.

In addition to calculating matches, the
questions can make great ice breakers.
Stemming from a question I answered, I
had a great conversation about Pokemon

with a guy that eventually developed into ,

an intellectual evaluation of ’9os culture
in general.
There are numerous succ_ess stories,

interrogate him before handing out your

number.

Still, there are some precautions you

‘should take:

1. Use your head if you actually plan
on meeting someone in person. “Sure,
pizza and a movie at your place sound
great, here’s my addressto pick me up!”

is not an appropriate answer to a ﬁrst date

invite. When he rolls up to your apartment
in his van that has brown paper taped to
conceal all of the back windows, don’t
blame me.

2. Keep it to public places, so that‘
if someone carries you away as you’re’
screaming, the authorities can be noti— .
ﬁed. Because after all, you never know if
someone just took pictures off another
person’s Facebook to conceal his age.

3. Be aware of someone’s intentions. If
a guy responds to “Wow I like your mus-
cles!” with “You haven’t even seen the
biggest one yet  What’s your e-mail?”
and then you end up with an inbox brim-

I .ming with lewd pictures, I’d think you

deserved it. , ’
OkCupid has an extensive section un-“H
der its “Terms and Conditions” warning‘
about giving personal informationrout
to others and with good reason. Just like

meeting a guy at a party or bar, they’re '

not all winners.

' Still, I think that it’s worth throwing
out the social stigmas and shame and giv-
ing OkCupid a try.

Oh, and by the way, I’m looking for a
Friday night date. Call me. I’ll pick you

World peace better
than successful
ﬁlm enemies

T'ybout<12 I 0

Unfortunately, this is by no means an isolated
problem: Across the board‘, movie villains are
becoming less distinct ——' in the case of “Red
Dawn,” they’re anonymous enough to facilitate
a post-production identity change — and thus,
less compelling.

Before I further bemoan our impoverished
bankof nemeses, it’s necessary to reﬂect on
the 20th century’s two most successﬁil movie
villains: the Nazis and the Soviets. These were
people who indisputably hated our guts and
worked tirelessly and mercilessly against our
continued prosperity. »

The Nazis, who repeatedly engaged our
troops in combat, were, perhaps, more of an
active enemy, but the Russians, an unceasing
Cold‘ War opponent, posed a reliable threat of
their own. An innumerable number of mov-
ies — including the original “Red Dawn” —
capitalized on these clear—cut anirnosities; the

“Indiana Jones” series, in fact, employed both -
- these powers as  ‘

Now, however, America’s enemies are more
fragmented, lackingaunifying nationality, creed
or political orientation. Accordingly, ﬁlmmakers
are forced to settle for religiously zealous Arabs

of ambiguous nationality, or ——_‘ in the case of .
~ the new “Red Dawn” — incensed East Asians

of interchangeable nationality. (Never mind that
halfthese countries don’t posses the capability
to launch an invasion of the U.S.). N

Of course, from a humanitarian perspec-
tive, our increasingly scant bank of villains is
heartening. The world, it seems, has become
too civil, and too economically codependent,
to engender the sort of war of empires that em-

broiled the ﬁrst halfof the 20th century. Even ’ -
. a second Cold War has, for the time being, re-

mained hypothetical.
' Nevertheless, the interests of action movies

and the interests of world peace are, as always, in '

opposition to each other. When countries make
good, action movies become less engaging. When
new, powerful enemies arise, ﬁlms like “Red
Dawn” attainanewvitality. With all due respect
to ﬁlmmakers, I’ll settle for world peace. .

Though great DVD workouts exist‘, you might
ﬁnd that supplementing yourworkout routine of
gymtime and ﬁtness classes with workout DVDs
is your best bet. After all, home routines do have
their disadvantages.

“When comparing an exercise DVD to a live
exercise class,youneedto considerseveralfictors:
encouragement, safety and tailoring,” said Laura
Fonzi, a clinical instructor and aerobic coordina-
tor at Pitt. “Oitentimes, it is more difficult to be
motivated by a television than by a live ﬁtness
instructorwho can provide continuous feedback

and encouragement on what you are doing.”

JuniorCailyGrube ﬁnds the gymenvironment
more motivating than her home environment.

‘All the energy of everyone working outatthe
gym is inspiring,” she said. “IfI do a DVD alone I
slack off.’ ’

Grube, who usedto do kickboxing DVDS with
her ﬁiends, said DVDs areﬁne if you’re doingthem
with other people to keep you motivated. But she
also ﬁnds the instructors  and wants
to take advantage of campus gyms included in
her tuition.

15

Anotherreasontoleaveyourlivingroom, Fonzi
said, is that an instructor provides an extra level
of safety in a ﬁtness class — letting you know
when you’re performing moves incorrectly and
also modifying different exercises for different
ﬁtness levels.

Butultimately, exerciseisexercisewhetheryou‘ j

do it at home or at the gym.

“The bottom line is that exercise is encour-
aged in all forms,” Fonzi said. “Whatever makes
a person exercise more frequently, as long as it is
safe, is recommended.” I

DIVING

Coach Krug receives diving honor

Roger Sepich
Staﬁ Writer

Head coachjulian Krug has led the A

Pitt diving team to many accom-
plishments over the past 32 years.
During that time, Krug’s leadership
produced 16 Big East Most Outstand-
ing Divers, eight All-Americans and
one NCAA Champion — his daugh-
ter Cassidy. i ’

This past Saturday, Krug’s sub-
stantial contributions to swimming
and diving culminated in his induc-
tion into the Pennsylvania Swim-
ming Hall of Fame.

“It is truly an honor to be consid-
ered in this esteemed class,” Krug
said in a news release. “The honor,
however, is secondary to the way
I feel about all of the athletes that
have passed through our program

to attain their own accomplishments ‘

in life.”

Krug joins 101 other members
of the Pennsylvania Swimming Hall
of Fame.

Since becoming a member of

Julian Krug:

Diving Coach of the Year awards.
Outside of collegiate swimming,
Krug also served for six years as the
United States national team coach
at the FINA Mexico Grand Prix, an
international swimming competi-

It is truly an honor to be
considered in this esteemed

class.

Pitt’s staff in 1979, Krug’s achieve-
ments haven’t gone unnoticed within
the swimming community. His work
has earned him six Big East Men’s

tion in open water, and has worked
with a few Olympic divers.
Krug thanked the University “for

giving me these lasting memories.” ‘

FOOTBALL

 

Randolph follows Graham to Pitt

Former Rice defensive coordinator to serve as football team’s new executive associate head coach and defensive line coach

Isaac Saul
Staﬁ‘ Writer

 -‘ When head football coach Todd

Graham decided he was going to
come to Pitt, there was one person
who he knew would be by his side
—— Paul Randolph.

Randolph, who will serve as
executive associate head coach
and defensive line coach, has
worked with Graham for the last
ﬁve seasons.

When it was time to head to the
Steel City, Randolph was all in.

“I just think that there are a
few places that when you have an
opportunity to go, you go,” Ran-
dolph said. “It didn’t take much
for Coach Graham, all he had to
do was ask me. I’ve worked with
him, he is a dear friend of mine,
and all he had to do was hint at‘ it
and I was in.”

In 2006, Randolph served
under Graham as assistant head
coach, defensive coordinator and
linebackers coach at Rice. ‘To-
gether, they manufactured one
the most impressive revitaliza-
tions in recent college football
history.

The Rice Owls earned their
ﬁrst bowl berth in 45 years after
a 7-5 regular season that included
victories in six of their ﬁnal seven
games.

“It really has nothing to do
with the style of offense or defense
or special teams,” Randolph said.
“It has to do with Coach Graham’s
way of selling his vision and get-
ting everyone to believe in that
vision.” .

Randolph has been around‘
football for a while. He was an
all—conference linebacker at Ten-
nessee-Martin before playing in
the Canadian Football League.

, Arizona State wrestler Anthony Robles looks to hug his coach after winning the NCAA
Wrestling Championship in the 125-pound weight class.

Mike Furlong
Stajfwfiter

You know that moment often seen in sports
movies? .

The moment whena huge underdog de-
feats a reigning power? Orwhen the little guy
with a lot of heart achieves greatness?

Sometimes in sports it’s safe to say that
movies have nothing on reality. This weekend
at the NCAA Wrestling Championship, An-

thony Robles accomplished something that
most people would think was pure Hollywood
ﬁction.

Robles, a senior wrestler for Arizona State
became one of 10 National Champions by

. dominating the 125-pound weight class. But

the thing that sets Robles apart from the nine
other. National Champions in-other weight
classes, and the other 321 wrestlers compet-
ing at the tournament, is that he only has one
leg. ’
That’s right, that sentence wasn’t a mistake.

Randolph confident in his new team

Randolph< 16

He moved on to coaching at Alabama
during its run as one of college’s best de-

Panthers can ﬁll the holes.
“One thing I’ve always believed in,

fenses, and coached right across the border  and something we believe in, is that in

at West Virginia in 2002, Where he became
familiar with the Big East. ’

Throughout his years coaching, Ran-
dolph has developed a bond with the rest of
the coaches, especially Graham, that exists
not just on the ﬁeld but off as well.

“If a person wants to develop a relation-
ship with" you and has put forth the effort
to groom that relationship, then naturally
you’re going to know and trust that person,”
Randolph said. “To me it’s just abouttrust
— I trust him.”

Even without Graham, there was plenty
to draw Randolph to Pittsburgh.

. “just the rich tradition of not only Pitt,
but thatvof the Pittsburgh Steelers and of

' the city of Pittsburgh,” Randolph said. “I’ve
‘been a‘Steelers fan a long time.”

Now that he is here, like the rest of the
coaches, it’s time to gauge where the Pan-
thers are and what their needs are going
to be. P '

0 portunity, wi step up and fill
t e void that needs to beﬁlfled.

For the players, the new terminology,
names of plays and system-of the new
coaches have brought have been the big-
gest adjustment so far.

“It’s just a change. Coach Randolph is
very adamant about my language,” defen-
sive tackle Chas Alecxih said, referring.
to the new terminology. “And when you

talk to me, talk to me in my language, not
what you used to call it. It’s a little bit of
an adjustment. I’ve been corrected more
than once.”

With any coaching change there are

bound to be differences, but after four ‘

spring practices, the players are starting

. to get used to Randolph’s coaching style.

“There’s different schemes, different
drills —— they’re [Gattuso and Patterson]
two different types of coaches, so learn-
ing new terms is a little bit different for us
especially to start but after the ﬁrst couple
weeks we’re starting to catch on,” defensive
tackle Myles Caragein said.

Like any coach, Randolph still has to
deﬁne success.

"Although the coaching staff has made 4,

it clear its long—term goal is to bring a Na-
tional Championship back to Pitt, Randolph
knows what he’s looking for in the year
ahead. . G‘

“Our high bar is young men of character
[and] young men of integrity,” Randolph
said. “Getting guys to do what we coach
them to do right the ﬁrst time we ask them

most of the mat in a low stance —.— essentially

Iowa. McDonough was also the defending Na-
tional Champion. Robles made it look easy,
turning McDonough to his back scoring near-

fall points for exposing his back to the mat "

— very rare for a title match.

Not only is Robles the best wrestler at his
weight: He was named the Tournament’s Out-
standing Wrestler. I ..

._Rob1es was born without his right leg. For I

most people thatwouldbe disappointing news,
likely leading to an uncomfortable seat in the
bleachers as a spectator, but not for Robles. He
excelled at wrestling in high school, compil-
ing a 129-15 record along with two Arizona
state titles. I -

Robles was also a standout wrestler
throughout his career as a Sun Devil. His na-
tional title marks the third time that he has
earned All—American status. The ﬁrst time
he competed in the NCAA Championship in

well. It would be incredible to do what Robles

has done in his life with two legs; it’s hard to .

imagine facing the challenges of grappling
with the best wrestlers in the nation with only
one leg and without ever seeming to feel sorry
for himself. V 4

Robles embodies the spirit of athletics — .

hetakes to the mat every match, putting his
heart and soul on the line. Robles took to the
mat 145, times in his career; he had his hand
raised in victory 122 times. The ﬁnaltime led to
one of the most inspiring images in sports his’-
tory: Robles hopping to the corner of the mat
into the arms of head coach Shawn Charles. .

So yes, Hollywood’s depiction of sports
can be inspiring, but none can touch the real
life story of Anthony Robles —— a kidifrom

. Mesa, Ariz., who has been able to reach the

Promised Land of wrestling despite all of the
adversity in the world. I

offseason, he starts over Lamar Patterson,
although both receive a bumpin playing
time.

So my starting lineup is Gibbs, Woodall,
Moore, Nasir Robinson and 

Khem Birch. The ﬁve—star recruit for-
went a post—graduate year at N otre Dame
Prep to join Pitt a year sooner than ex-
pected. Withveverybody on both sides of
the recruiting process ecstatic that he’s
coming to college early, I can’t see him
backing up someone else for very long,
if at all.

Young Panthers generally serve as un-
derstudies to start their careers, but if
there’s a player that disrupts Jamie Dix-
on’s ideology and gets to cut the line, it’s
Birch. He’s a tremendous shot—blocker
and rebounder, and~I think he’ll start even
though he’s raw. A I

Khem Birch, eh? So what happens to
Dante Taylor?

Birch passes Taylor as Jamie Dixon’s all-
time highest—rated recruit, and if Taylor
doesn’t have an outstanding offseason,
Birch, will pass him on the depth chart,
too. -
Taylor hasn’t developed like many
thought he would as an All—American com-
ing out of high school. His numbers are
good — over 10 points and 10 rebounds
per 40 minutes —— but he has been a weak‘-
ness at times. He found himself in foul
trouble in each of the last three games of
the year, culminating in a scoreless night
in nine minutes of play against Butler.

Taylor isn’t in the conversation to lose
his scholarship —— that’s crazy talk — but
Birch has NBA written all over him. He’s
tough competition. Besides, the Panthers
will have a deep rotation again next year,
especially in the frontcourt. So Taylor will
stillplay 15-20 minutes per night.

"Hey, speaking of that Butler loss —
should Pitt fire Dixon? ’

No. Stop. Just  stop. .

We’re seven months away from the

Blue-Gold Scrimmage, but I still want '

to know’ who will be the favorite in the
Big East next year.

Will pass him on the depth

' There are three standout teams in ‘my
book: Pitt, Louisville and Syracuse.

The Cardinals are my pre—preseason V

choice to win the conference. Their story
resembles Pitt’s last season —- picked to
ﬁnish tied for 8th in the Big East Preseason
Coaches’ Poll, they surprised everyone by
finishing in a three-way tie for third and
have just one senior departing.

If all the underclassmen stay, they’re
worth the first—place vote, just like Pitt
was this year. I
