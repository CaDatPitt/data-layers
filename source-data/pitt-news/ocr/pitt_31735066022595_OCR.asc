Student Leaders Speak Out About Schenley Renovations

ta‘-: .

.0

By SUE McFARLAN D
Pitt News Staff Writer

Plans unveiled last week ,to
renovate Schenley Hall were
greeted with mixed emotions by
members of various student organi-
zations. -

The plans, introduced by Terry
Milani, associate director of the
Ofﬁce of Student Activities calls for
renovations that would add a pub,

large concert hall, handball courts.

and a health spa to the existing
facilities. ' _

The renovations‘ estimated to
cost nearly $10.5 million would be
funded directly from an increase ‘in
student's tuition. A plan intro-
duced last ‘year to levy ‘a student
union fee that -would be over and

above the tuition was scraped" in _,

favor of including the renovations
fees in the tuition.
Ron Story, lecture chairman of

the Pitt Union Program Council
objected to several points of the
plans.

Story believed sufficient student
imput was not solicited before
drafting the plans. He also claimed
that the meeting to announce the
plans was not made known to the
general student populations.

Milani said it would be im-
possible for Pitt to secure any
type of state or-federal funding for
the project. _

_“My main objection is to how it
was presented,” Story said. “I
think it is wrong for them to go
ahead on a project like this without
ftrst exploring how we might get
funding from thestate or federal
government.” I

_ Story was in favor of the large
programming hall that will accom-
odate upwards of 1,000 students for
lectures and concerts.

' terson

Student Government Board
member Kim Watterson ‘favored
the plans, welcoming any move
toward completing the project
which began 10 years ago.

‘‘I’m just happy th‘ey’re ﬁnally
doing something about renovations
after such a long time,” Watterson
said. “Right now I can't see any
major problems in what we were
told last week but I would like to
look at the blueprints to see just
exactly what kind of space‘ each
organization will be receiving.”

Watterson believed the method

‘of funding recommended in the

plan was suitable to the needs of
the students. Her major concern

was that students presently enrol-

led in the univesity should not pay
for a project that will not be’
completed for several years. Wat-
learned however" that
students would not begin_paying

for the project until the renovations '
are totally completed.

“I can see nothing wrong with
charging the student for ‘the
project, after all, who knows what
else comes out of tuition item by
item,” Watterson said.

“As far as I can see the plan goes
along very well with the student
survey taken last year in trying to

service the students needs,”
Watterson said. "‘I_am happy with

the plans. This is a-large urban A

university and we need Va. place

where student can go to enjoy‘

themselves. When was the last

time you heard someone say p“Lets ‘

go over to the student union for a
while and hang out?” “
Student Government‘ ‘ Board
member Todd Park also agreed
with the proposed plans to renovate
Schenley Hall. .
“I really" hope they get the

athletic facilities which ,in my > 

opinion are the most important part
of the renovations,” Park said.
“I’m happy to see that this much
progress has been made.
very much surprised to see that
they even had a plan when we came
back to school.”

Park said he believed the
Student Union fee -might be the
best method of funding‘
renovation project. ,

“The Student Union fee doesn’t

sound as attractive because you  "I;

have to pay above and beyond the?

cost of tuition but with the~fee you  I 
would know exactly where your '

"money is going and who knows
where all of our tuition money
goes,” Park said.

In the next edition of the Pitt.’ 

News the administration will voice

its views on the long awaited ‘
Schenley Hall renovation project. .

The hfadltlonal Frlday Happy Hou—r may not have been the same last week, as hundreds of students flocked to the
Student Union Lawn, Instead, to enjoy the Iron City Houserockers. i

  Oakland Neighbors Joinfor Annual Semple St. Fair t

By CINDY I-IECKATHORN
For one day each Fall, Semple
"Street in Oakland is transformed
into a festival ground of, music,
ethnic food, dance and crafts as
people ..from- various. Oakland
.neighborhoods pull together to
hold the annual Semple Street Fair.
The ﬁfth annual fair. sponsored
-by the South Oakland Citizens
Council and People’s Oakland, two
neighborhood action groups, was
held Sunday in an effort to promote

higher community awareness.

We try to bring people from all,
Oakland neighborhoods together in
order to provide them_ with a sense
of unity,” said Sandra Phillips,

- coordinator of People’s Oakland."

Included in the fair a're’_citizens

from the Terrace Village housing '

project, Boundry Street, “Little
Italy” and Central Oakland which
is mainly composed of students,
and long time residents.
According to Phillips, participa-
tion in these fairs has been very low
‘until this year when membersof
Pitt's Student Government Board
set up a booth aimed at bringing
the university closer to the
community by distributing inform-

- ation and answering questions.

“Until now it seems the only .

‘time Pitt students were involved
with the Oakland community was in
neighborhood conflicts,” board
member- Kim Watterson said.
Watterson attributes the lack of
student participation in the Semple
Street Fair to the fact that it is held
i so early in the school year when

‘I
‘l

students are moving back to school

and getting adjusted to university -

life. ,

Among the festivities at this
year’s,fair included a variety of live
entertainment sponsored by the
Department of County Parks and
Recreation, booths by local citizens
groups, a disco. contest with

. Jonathan Whaley of Pitt’s WPGH-

AM acting as emcee..

A sries of educational booths
were also constructed by the
Pennsylvania Alliance. for Jobs",
Energy and Mobilization for
Survival, and the Animal Care and
Welfare League.

The Semple Steet Food Coop-

suggested alternative diets to

citizens—diets composed of natural

foods lacking" preservatives.
Ethnic foods abounded at the

1

Semple Street Fair with various
ethnic groups selling food to raise
money for community projects.

Betty Kelly, a resident, of
Bouquet Street made Greek ﬂake
pastries while I customers waited.

“All the members of our Peoples
Oakland block club came to lend a
hand,” she said.

Ke1ly’s block club has part-
icipated in cardio pulmonary
rescusitation and crime prevention
classes sponsored by Peoples
Oakland.

Georgie Gay, a 20-year-old
resident of Oakland sold spare ribs
with the funds going to "Reach
Out,” a branch of the South
Oakland Citizens Cou’ncildedicated

‘to giving young ‘people a creative
outlet‘ while" teaching them art

appreciation. . ~ --
“If more adults took this time to
care about young people we
wouldn’t need crime prevention,”-
Gay said. A

With Pitt students becomingl

involved in Oakland community
affairs the _Student Government
Board has formed a new sub-

Iwas,

U 2 ‘gm   Nana     

the‘ A

committee titled the Community V

Relations and Local Politics Com-
mittee.

“The committee will be a liason

between the university, the South 

Oakland Citizens Council and
Peoples Oakland on important-
community issues,” said . Watter-
son.

The committee will be ’open_to/

any undergraduate interested in
community affairs. 9 -/ '

Doctors Need New Disease Fighters

By The Associated Press

~DENVER-—As germs become more immune to
antibiotics doctors must try to find disease fighters in
the body's own immunity systems. says an official of
National Jewish Hospital-National Asthma Center.
- “There aren't very many new antibiotics on the
horizon. and I think we must resign ourselves to the
fact that these drugs may one day no longer be

effective," said Dr. Richard B. Johnston.
He said penicillin is ineffective against some
strains of venereal disease and that doctors are

having trouble combating the bacteria that cause‘

pneumonia and abscesses.

“If we can understand the immune system. then
we can make’ it ﬁght all diseases.“ Johnston said.

Legal Stimulant‘Zoom’
Sold OutAcross U. S.   

By The Associated Press

I ' BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.—A

stimulant called “Zoom” is caus-
ing a sensation on the drug scene,
where users say they are ﬁnding a
new “high” from the pill and its
unusual selling point—it’s legal.
Zoom is being touted as ‘»"a
natural organic stimulant and

food stores, across the nation say
they cannot keep enough of the

‘ stuff in stock.-

Although Zoom’s main "ingred-

Users have compared Zoom’s

BLOOD DONORS REQUESTED

Due to a critical blood shortage, Central Blood Bank has requested its 30 area member
hospitals to postpone elective surgeries until blood supplies return to normal. v

A combination of factors such as local strikes that have caused cancellation of a number
of blood drives, the extended Labor Day holiday and continuation of the vacation period,
coupled with increasedidemand by area hospitals have led to the shortage. To supply normal
area blood needs, 350 donors per day are required. To meet that requirement and to

-replenish the already diminished supply an additional 200 donors are needed daily over the
next seven days. _ .

Appointments to donate are not necessary during this shortage. Blood donors of all types
can come to the main donor station at 812 Fifth Avenue (across from Chatham Center), the
Washington Blood Center at 111 N. Main Street, Washington, PA or at these community
mobile locations: ‘ ' ' ' A A .

A young Pantherette volleyball
team got its first taste of
international competition (as a
team) Saturday when the Panther-
ettes fell to the’ Warsaw Academy

‘ of Physical Education.

Warsaw, 'Poland’s national ama-
teur champions, defeated the
Pantherettes in three straight
games in the best three out of ﬁve
match:15-2, 15-8, 15-9.

“We were nervous,” said head
coach Mike Hebert, “and never
really settled down. We never
were really effective.”

The ﬁrst game was all Warsaw’s
as they jumped out to a 9-0 lead

.before the Pantherettes scored

their ﬁrst point. It took Pitt a while

'to score in game two also, after

falling behind 6-0. With the score
14-4, and Paula Olsen serving, the
Pantherettes staged a great come-
back. Sparked by three aces by
Olsen, Pitt drew to 14-8 before the
Poles scored the ﬁrst point to take
the game.

In Game three, Pitt was actually
ahead 2-1, and kept the game close
before falling. Going behind 13-3,
the Pantherettesvscared the Poles
by closing to within ﬁve points at
14-9. '

“I did see enough good things to

. know that we’re going to have a

great year,” said Hebert. “If I had
to single out any players I’d have to
say that they would be Paula Olsen
and Julie Gaul.”

Gaul, a freshman, started‘ and’

played the entire match, digging
and spiking throughout.

“Julie is just really beginning to
learn the college game,” said
Hebert. “And this is the ﬁrst time

' we have played together after only

four days of practice.”

Although the Pantherettes were
nervous, according to Hebert they
weren’t intimidated by the Poles,
as most of the spikers have
competed internationally before,
but with other teams.

“I really didn’t place a whole lot
of importance on this match,” said
Hebert. “It was more of a formal
scrimmage, an exhibition.”

Hebert said he juggled the‘

lineup to ﬁnd the best combina-

The vlsltlng Poles proved,too much for both Pitt squads despite impressive

tions for the upcoming season. He
also said Pitt was using a new
offense with a lot of switching
patterns.

The Pantherettes are now
preparing for one of the most

In important parts of their season, a
west coast trip where the Panther-

 ettes will face ﬁve of the top-10‘

_ “The only way to get better is to

coach said. “No other Eastern
team plays a schedule like ours. In

fact, only Maryland will play a top‘

face eight top-10 teams before’ our

If Saturday’s match with the
Olsztyn team of Poland is any
indication as to what will follow in
the Panther volleyball team's
second season, Eastern competi-
tion better keep their eyes open for
a much improved Pitt squad. <

Although the Panthers were beat
three games to zero in the best of
ﬁve match, this team seems to be
heading towards a successful
season. .

Under the direction of head
coach Ray Reilly and assistant
Mike Hebert, the Panthers have
only been working togetheras a
team for two weeks. The men to
not begin their regular collegiate
season until the middle of January,
giving them another four months to
work on improving an already
disciplined and hustling squad.

“We played great,” said a very

happy Reilly and after only two 3

weeks of practice together. That
was Polands’ number one club
team with four national team

5 players on it, and we looked just

tremendous against them.”

might be over quickly. Physically
the two teams were mismatched,

-with- the Poles a much bigger,

stronger and experienced team. A
-smaller Pitt team had to hustle
every minute of each game inorder
to keep up with this mature Polish
squad. ‘ .1 '

And hustle they did, after a very
successful opening; The Panthers
stayed with the Poles in the ﬁrst
minutes of the opening game tieing

A the game at two, three,\four, ﬁve‘

and six points apiece.‘ The very
.poised Poles then "began to pull
away and scored nine consecutive
points to win the initial game 15-6.

Much to the amazement of the
-Panthers and the spectators, Pitt

l

was not to be tired out with this /‘I

ﬁrst game. Pitt opened game two
in the lead and at one"point led the
Poles 8-2. The Polish_ squad
seemed to be letting Pitt play their
game, but then they conﬁdently
regained momentum and tied the

spectators.

Also in attendance were several assistant coaches
from the University of Georgia, whose Bulldogs were
to be Pitt’s first opponent in the Majors regime.

And, as is usually the case with intrasquad games,
there wasn't much excitement for the fans. The
Georgia coaches felt the same way, because they left
Pitt Stadtum at halftime, apparently convinced they
had nothing to worry about, even with the first game
five months away, Saturday, September 15.

And why should they have been worried‘! Wasn’t
this Pitt team 1-10 the previous year? And wasn’t
this the team that lost to Penn State, 49-27, and Air
Force, 41-13?

The ‘answers to both questions was yes, and the
1972 Pitt Panthers were indeed a bad football team,
finishing with the worst record in the school’s
history.

But the scouts from Georgia were overlooking a
few. important factors. Primarily, they weren’t
paying any attention to the recruiting job Majors and
his staff had done. Those players didn’t pariieipalte
in the spring game, including a skinny l60—pound
halfback named Tony Dorsett, and a burly middle
guard named Burley. -

By Sam Sciu//o

   

It didn’t take long for the Bulldogs to realize their
gross overconfidence. When Pitt arrived in Athens,
Georgia for the . game,’ they were greeted by
newspaper columns which predicted the Bulldogs
would win by such scores as 54-6, and 49-7. The
Bulldogs had been 7-4 the previous yearand playing
at Sanford Stadium would be tough on any team,
especially the Pitt Panthers. '

But a funny thing happened Saturday, September
15. The Panthers, playing with a new found “Pride
and Enthusiasm” scored an upset of sorts by tying
the Bulldogs, 7-7. But it was a moral victory for
Majors and his players. They had clearly outplayed
the home club. (Pitt could have won, but Carson
Long missed an easy 34-yard field goal with three
minutes remaining, and his was the only sad face in
the locker room following the game).

So now we’re,here, six years_later. Pitt has won a
national championship, gone to five bowl games in
six years and hasn’t had’ a losing season» since the
Disaster of 1972. I '

._ off a 1-10 season, and with a newvhead coach, Don

Farmbrough. The Panthers enter the game with a
full head of steam, eager to improve after last year’s
‘_‘disappointing” 8-4 season. The players themselves-
are talking about 10-1, 11-0 and a major bowl bid.
Coach Jackie Sherrill says’ his team is anxious to

 resume its place among the elite in college football. -

(“That’s where we belong”).

But is all will with the Pitt football team?

Despite some injuries and inexperience among
some defensive players, the unit sliould be strong,
and will keep Pitt in the game. That puts it up to the
offense, which hopesto show more than the option
right, option left,’ look for Gordon Jones pattern of,

~, last year.

But the receiving corps has been hit rather severely
by the injury bug, ‘and if the players at these positions
are unable to hang on to the ball Saturday, it could
be a nail biter against a team that wasl-10 last year.

Even the calendar is, a bit coiricidental. Because
this Saturday, September 15, is six yearsto the day
from when another football team opened a new era
underla new coach. A .

And the results were a little less than what thehome

The Pitt soccer team was able to
warmup for its contest against
Akron this Wednesday by soundly
beating the Panther Alumni, 5-1,
last Friday. The game with Akron
on Wednesday could be the most
important one the Panthers will
play all season.

The Panthers outplayed the
former Pitt players in every area.
Coach Leon Bemis was able to take
a good look at his 1979 athletes,
and discovered a number- of
top-notch new players to compli-
ment the experienced veterans.
The first score of the game came
with 22:00 gone in the initial half of
play, Jeff Tissue scoring on a pass
from freshman Troy Norton.
Tissue, who is one of‘ the team’s

The next Panther goal came
when midﬁelder Danny Hamm took
the ball down the field to the
20-yard line, where a shot on goal
turned into a pass to Werner
Woodman, who tapped the ball in
for a Panther goal. ' Five minutes‘
later, the Panthers were again on
the scoreboard when sophomore Al

Kevin Huffman for a Huffman

The Panthers were far from

minutes remaining in the game,
freshman center forward Eric
Tiedtke took a-pass from the right
wing and raced down ﬁeld. Tiedtke
played it one-on-one with the goalie
and upped the margin to 4-0.

A minute later the Alumni
received its only score of the night
when Chucho Valencia put the ball
past goalie Greg Blum.

The Panther scoring ended with
less than 60 seconds remaining as
midﬁelder Bob Hughes took apass

“We broke up the continuity of
the game last Friday in an effort to

_ give everyone a chance to play,”

said Bemis. ‘'1 think that
physically, we looked like we'll
have more opportunity.to put the
ball in the net this season. We
scored five goals and had a good
defensive game,” he added.
“There is a lot of depth on this
yeairfs squad, along with a much
differend attitude than last season.
The men all seem to be able to work
well with whomever is playing at
the time.”

The Panthers will be able to see
for themselves, plus show a lot of
skeptics just what they can do
Wednesday against Akron. A good
showing against Akron and even
better, a win, could put the
Panthers on the road to a
successful year. Game time is 7:00

stayed with them, though, and
scored two more points before
losing the second contest 15-10. »

_ This second game was a very
pleasing one for the Panthers
according to Captain Jeff Beavers.

“I think the team played quite
well . in each game tonight
considering the caliber of competi-
tion that we were up against, along
with the short time that the team
has been able to play together,”
said Beavers. ‘

Beavers was one of many
Panthers who played a strong
competitive match. Another strong
Panther performance came from
newcomer Don Hardin at the
middle blocker position. In game
three, the Panthers were outplayed
15-4, but Hardin was able to come
through with a number of good
hustling plays. Being an ex-mem-
ber of the Air Force, Hardin has
just begun school here at Pitt and
should prove to be a big addition to
the Panther team.

1 Poles Polish Off Pitt

“I thought the team played well
tonight,” said Hardin, “although I
think that our. blocking needs to be
improved. It was our ﬁrst match
together and it was a good one.”

Setting for the Panthers against
the Poles was Scott Robbing, one of
only four returners for the Pitt
team. The team is using a different
type of setup this season, where
they will play a 5-1 offense using
only one setter, who will‘ be
Robbins. Beavers, who was the
other setter last season, has moved
back to the hitting position.

“I thought this match was a
great experience,” said Robbins.
“I see a lot of good things for our
upcoming season. Also, the match
was a lot of fun.”

The Panthers will be competing
here and there until their season
does open ona regular schedule in
January. Anyone wanting to try‘
out for the Pantherfsquad is urged
toon Tuesday, September 18. All
information can be obtained from
coaches Reilly and,Hebert.
